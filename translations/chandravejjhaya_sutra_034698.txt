##  Agam Sutra 30/2, Payanna Sutra-7/2, ‘Chandravedhyak’
[30/2] Chandravedhyak Payanna Sutra-7/2- Hindi Translation
Sutra - 1
Salutations to the glorious Siddha Bhagavants, who are always present on the head (Siddhashila) of the human beings, and possess the developed, complete, and superior qualities of knowledge and vision, and to the glorious Arihant Paramatma, who illuminates knowledge in the world. Sutra - 2
This chapter is the essence of the Jin Agam, a scripture that guides towards liberation, and is full of profound and significant meaning. Listen to it with a focused mind, free from all four types of distortions, and do not be negligent for even a moment in acting according to it. Sutra - 3
I will speak about humility, the qualities of an Acharya, the qualities of a disciple, the qualities of humility-control, the qualities of knowledge, the qualities of conduct, and the qualities of death. Sutra - 4
The knowledge acquired from an Acharya-Guru, even if obtained with great difficulty, becomes useless for a person who disrespects him. Sutra - 5
A being who disrespects the Guru due to the strength of his karma, is arrogant, proud, and devoid of humility. Such a being cannot attain fame or glory anywhere in the world, but only faces defeat everywhere. Sutra - 6
A person who humbly accepts the knowledge taught by the Guru, attains shelter, trust, and fame everywhere. Sutra - 7
The knowledge acquired with great effort by an undisciplined disciple is bound to be destroyed due to the fault of disrespecting the Guru. Even if it is not completely destroyed, it will not yield its true benefits. Sutra - 8
Knowledge is worthy of repeated remembrance and preservation. It is not fit to be given to the undisciplined and unworthy. Because both the undisciplined and the knowledge-giver, the Guru, face defeat. Sutra - 9
An undisciplined being who disrespects knowledge and does not reveal the qualities of the knowledge-giver, the Acharya, attains strong falsehood and becomes a Rishi-killer, experiencing the suffering of hell and other miserable states. Sutra - 10
Knowledge acquired by a virtuous person endowed with humility and other qualities becomes powerful. Just like a girl born in a noble family becomes great by getting an ordinary man as her husband. Sutra - 11
O child! Practice humility until you achieve it. What use is knowledge to you without humility? Indeed, learning humility is difficult, but knowledge is easily accessible to the humble.

**Aagam Sutra 30/2, Payanna Sutra-7/2, ‘Chandravedhyak’ Sutra - 12**

O well-behaved child! Learn knowledge and scriptural wisdom with humility, remember the learned knowledge and virtues repeatedly, and do not be careless in them. Because the knowledge that is acquired and counted becomes a source of happiness in the afterlife. Sutra - 13

The fruit of knowledge learned with humility, taught by the Guru with joy, and memorized completely through the sutras can certainly be felt. Sutra - 14

In this difficult time, it is extremely rare to find an Acharya Bhagvant, the giver of all scriptural knowledge, and then it is also rare to find a disciple who learns scriptural knowledge without the four kshayas (anger, pride, etc.). Sutra - 15

Whether it is a sadhu or a householder, wise men certainly praise their humility. An unrefined person can never achieve fame or glory in the world. Sutra - 16

Some people, despite knowing the nature, fruit, etc. of humility, do not want to practice humility due to the influence of strong inauspicious karma and are surrounded by attachment and aversion. Sutra - 17

Even those who do not speak or read much, but are always humble and submissive with control over their senses, some men or women, their fame spreads everywhere in the world. Sutra - 18

Knowledge bears fruit only for the fortunate man, but knowledge does not bear fruit for the unfortunate. Sutra - 19

One who despises or misuses knowledge and destroys the virtues of knowledgeable Acharyas Bhagvant, etc., through slander, insult, etc., becomes deeply deluded by falsehood and suffers terrible misfortune. Sutra - 20

Indeed! It is not easy to find an Acharya Bhagvant, the giver of all scriptural knowledge. And then it is also not easy to find a disciple who is simple and constantly striving in the practice of knowledge. Sutra - 21

This is a brief description of the great benefits of becoming a special-humble person through the virtue of humility. Now I will speak of the virtues of Acharya Bhagvant, listen attentively. Sutra - 22

I will speak of the virtues of such an Acharya, who is the embodiment of the pure path of conduct, the carrier of the jewel of scriptural knowledge, and the possessor of countless virtues like forgiveness, etc. Sutra - 23-27

One who bears everything like the earth, is steadfast in unwavering dharma like Mount Meru, and has a gentle radiance like the moon, one who does not reveal the faults pointed out by disciples, etc., to others. One who knows the proper intention, reason, and method of criticism, one who has a serious heart, one who is not defeated by rivals, etc. One who knows the proper time, place, and feeling...

**Agam Sutra 30/2, Payanna Sutra-7/2, "Chandravadhyak"**

Those who know the "Chandravadhyak", are free from haste, do not rush in any work, are free from delusion, inspire their disciples and dependents in self-restraint, study, etc., are free from illusion, have knowledge of worldly, Vedic and social sciences, and are knowledgeable in the Swasamaya Jinagam and Parasamaya-Anyadarshan Shastra, whose beginning is Samayik and end is pre-arranged. Such a Dwadashangi, whose meaning they have found and accepted, is always praised by learned scholars and pandits. Sutra - 28

In the endless cycle of birth and death, this being has acquired thousands of Acharyas, who are knowledgeable and teachers of karma, work, art and other religious practices for many births. Sutra - 29-30

The Acharyas who are mentioned in the Nirgranth Pravachan, are the ones who explain the true nature of both the world and liberation, just as hundreds of lamps are lit from one illuminated lamp, yet that lamp remains illuminated and radiant, so too are the Acharyas like lamps, illuminating and liberating themselves and other souls. Sutra - 31-32

Those who constantly pay homage to the feet of the glorious Acharyas, who are like the sun in their brilliance, the moon in their gentleness and coolness, and who are revolutionary and capable of leading across the ocean of the world, are blessed. Such devotion to the glorious Acharyas brings fame in this world, the highest divine destiny in the next world, and unyielding, unparalleled knowledge and faith in religion. Sutra - 33, 34

Even the gods residing in the heavenly realms, through their divine knowledge, see the glorious Acharyas and always remember their virtues, and arrange their seats, beds, etc.

Even the gods residing in the heavenly realms, amidst beautiful apsaras, remember the Nirgranth Pravachan and have those apsaras pay homage to the glorious Acharyas. Sutra - 35

Those sadhus who, despite performing difficult austerities like the sixth, eighth, and four fasts, do not follow the Guru's words, become eternally bound to the cycle of birth and death. Sutra - 36

There are many other virtues of the glorious Acharyas, which cannot be counted. Now I will briefly describe the special qualities of a disciple. Sutra - 37

Those who are always humble, polite, free from pride, knowledgeable, virtuous, and understand the intentions and desires of the glorious Acharyas, are praised by learned men. (Such a sadhu is called a good disciple). Sutra - 38

Those disciples who are patient in enduring cold, heat, wind, hunger, thirst, and discomfort, and who are like the earth in bearing all kinds of adversity and prosperity, are praised by wise men. Sutra - 39

Those disciples whose facial expressions do not change in the face of gain or loss, i.e., they do not become joyful or sorrowful, and who have few desires and are always content, are praised by learned men. Muni Diparatnasagar Krit "(Chandravadhyak)" Agam Sutra - Hindi Translation"

**Agam Sutra 30/2, Payanna Sutra-7/2, Chandravedhyak' Sutra-40**

A disciple who knows the six types of Vinaya-vidhi and is interested in spiritual benefit, is praised by the Gitas even if he is humble and devoid of pride like Riddhi etc. Sutra - 41

A disciple who is always eager to perform the ten types of Vyavachch like Acharya etc., constantly strives in recitation etc. and is engaged in all the essentials like Samayik etc., is praised by the wise. Sutra - 42

The great sages praise a disciple who praises the qualities of the Acharyas, enhances the glory of the Gachchvasi Guru and the Shasana, and is highly alert towards his goal with pure wisdom. Sutra - 43

O seeker of liberation! First of all, kill all kinds of pride and then acquire education. Only a well-behaved disciple becomes another soul disciple, a non-disciple does not become a disciple of anyone. Sutra - 44

A well-behaved disciple should be able to bear the very harsh or loving words of Acharya Shri well. Sutra - 45, 46

Now, some specific characteristics and qualities of a disciple are mentioned for his test, who is endowed with excellent caste, family, form, youth, strength, vigor-valor, equality and sattva qualities, is soft-spoken, does not gossip, is not deceitful, naked and not greedy, has unbroken hands and feet, has less hair, has a smooth and strong body, has a deep and elevated nose, has a generous gaze, has a long vision and has large eyes. Sutra - 47

He should be a devotee of the Jinasasana, a partisan, looking towards the mouth of the Guru, full of patience, faith, free from vices and living a life dominated by humility. Sutra - 48

He who recognizes time, place and opportunity, knows the form of character and humility, is free from greed, fear, attachment, sleep and fatigue, is called a proper disciple by the skilled. Sutra - 49

A man may be proficient in Shruta-jnana, know the reason, cause and method, yet if he is not humble and is proud, the Shruta-dhar Maharshis do not praise him. Sutra - 50, 51

A pure, devoted, always practicing the conduct of humility, simple-hearted, enhancing the beauty of the discourse and patient disciple should be given the recitation of the Agam.

Even a son who is deficient in the above-mentioned humility etc. qualities and is endowed with hundreds of other qualities like Nay etc., is not taught the scriptures by a well-wisher, then how can a completely quality-less disciple be taught the knowledge of the scriptures? Sutra - 52

This disciple test, which is explained in detail in the scriptures with a skillful and subtle meaning, is said in brief. A Guru who desires the benefit of the hereafter must definitely test the disciple. Muni Diparatnasagar Krit "(Chandravedhyak)" Agam Sutra-Hindi Translation"

##  Agama Sutra 30/2, Payanna Sutra-7/2, ‘Chandravedhyak’ Sutra - 53
I have briefly described the qualities of a disciple, now I will tell you about the restraining qualities of humility, listen carefully with an attentive mind. Sutra - 54
Humility is the door to liberation. Humility should never be rejected because even a person who practices little knowledge can conquer all karma through humility. Sutra - 55
The person who conquers non-humility through humility, lack of character through good conduct, and sin through non-sinful conduct, conquers all three realms. Sutra - 56
A Muni who is proficient in knowledge, understands the cause, effect, and method, but is still arrogant and proud, is not praised by the Shruta-dhar-geetarthas. Sutra - 57, 58
Even a person with vast knowledge, if he is devoid of good qualities, humility, and lax in his conduct, is considered to have little knowledge by the geetarthas. A person who is endowed with austerity, discipline, and good conduct, always engaged in knowledge, insight, and conduct, even if he has little knowledge, is considered to have vast knowledge by the wise. Sutra - 59
Knowledge is embedded in right conduct, both knowledge and insight are included in character, through the power of forgiveness, austerity and through humility, specific types of discipline become successful and independent. Sutra - 60
Specific types of austerity, specific types of discipline, and many other qualities become fruitless and useless without humility, which grants liberation. Sutra - 61
The infinite knowing Lord Jinendra, while outlining the path to liberation in all realms of karma, first taught humility. Sutra - 62
Humility is knowledge, and knowledge is humility. Because knowledge is obtained through humility, and through knowledge, the nature of humility can be understood. Sutra - 63
The essence of a human's entire character is established in humility, therefore, the Nirgrantha Maharshis do not praise a Muni who lacks humility. Sutra - 64
Even with vast knowledge, a person who is arrogant and lacks faith and devotion cannot cultivate character, and a character-corrupted being continues to wander in the world. Sutra - 65
A Muni who is content with even a little knowledge, is eager to practice humility, and diligently follows the five great vows, is praised by the Nirgrantha Maharshis.

**Agam Sutra 30/2, Payanna Sutra-7/2, ‘Chandravadhyak’ follows the path of non-violence and keeps mind, speech, and body secret, he is surely a devotee of character. Sutra - 66**

**What benefit can the study of great scriptures bring to a virtuous person without humility? What benefit can millions and billions of shining lamps bring to a blind human? Sutra-67,68**

**In this way, I have briefly described the specific benefits of humility. Now I will describe the special qualities and benefits of the knowledge of scriptures learned through humility, listen. **

**Shri Jinendra, the Supreme Being, has given teachings, it is not possible to fully know the great subject matter of the scriptures. Therefore, that man is praiseworthy, who is knowledgeable and virtuous. Sutra - 69**

**The detailed form of the upper world, lower world, and the world of animals, including gods, demons, humans, Garuda sons, Naga sons, and Gandharva gods, can be known through the knowledge of scriptures. Sutra - 70**

**A wise man can also know the nine principles through the knowledge of scriptures - being, non-being, merit, demerit, inflow, restraint, bondage, liberation, and liberation. Therefore, knowledge is the cause of character. Sutra-71**

**The abandonment of known faults and the use of known virtues, that is, both things that are instrumental to religion are achieved only through knowledge. Sutra-72**

**Character (action) alone without knowledge and knowledge alone without action do not become liberators. But a knowledgeable person with (action) crosses the ocean of the world. Sutra - 73**

**Even though he is knowledgeable, if he does not abide in virtues like forgiveness, etc., and does not abandon vices like anger, etc., then he can never become free from vices and virtuous. Sutra - 74**

**Bound by many feelings due to the vices of non-restraint and ignorance, the good and bad karmic impurities are completely destroyed by the knowledgeable person through the practice of character. Sutra - 75**

**Like a soldier alone without a weapon, or a weapon alone without a soldier, knowledge without character and character without knowledge do not become liberators. Sutra - 76**

**There is no knowledge for one who has a false view, there are no virtues of character without knowledge, there is no complete liberation without virtues, and there is no nirvana without complete karmic liberation. Sutra - 77**

**Āgama Sūtra 30/2, Payannā Sūtra-7/2, Chandravedhyaka' Sūtra-78**
The man who properly understands the ultimate meaning of the discourse, knowing bondage and liberation well, destroys his ancient karma. Sūtra - 79
Knowledge leads to right action, and action leads to the assimilation of knowledge. In this way, the combination of knowledge and right action purifies the mind and character. Sūtra - 80
Knowledge illuminates, austerity purifies, and restraint protects. In this way, the combination of knowledge, austerity, and restraint leads to liberation in the Jina Dharma. Sūtra - 81
People of the world repeatedly look at the mouth of a multi-learned, great soul like the moon. What is greater, more wondrous, and more beautiful than that? Sūtra - 82
Just as the cool moonlight emanates from the moon, bringing joy and delight to all, so too, cool Jina words like sandalwood emanate from the mouth of a knowledgeable person, enabling humans to cross the ocean of existence. Sūtra - 83
Just as a needle threaded with yarn does not get lost even when it falls into garbage, so too, a soul who knows the Āgama does not get lost even when it falls into the forest of existence. Sūtra - 84
Just as a needle without yarn becomes lost and invisible, so too, a soul enveloped in falsehood without the knowledge of the Sūtra-śāstra gets lost in the ocean of existence. Sūtra - 85
By seeing the true nature of the ultimate reality through the knowledge of the scriptures, by maintaining the qualities of austerity and restraint throughout life, and by losing the body and possessions at the time of death, the soul attains a special, good, and liberated state. Sūtra - 86
Just as a physician knows the diagnosis of a disease through the knowledge of medical science, so too, a monk knows how to purify his character through the knowledge of the scriptures. Sūtra - 87
Just as a physician cannot diagnose a disease without studying medical texts, so too, a monk cannot know the means of purifying his character without the knowledge of the Āgama. Sūtra - 88
Therefore, a soul aspiring for liberation should constantly strive to study the meaning of the Āgama as formulated by the Tīrthankaras. Sūtra - 89
There is no other austerity equal to self-study, nor will there ever be, among the twelve types of external and internal austerities taught by the Supreme Lord Jina.

## Agam Sutra 30/2, Payanna Sutra-7/2, ‘Chandravedhyak’ Sutra - 90, 91
One who is interested in the study of knowledge should make an effort, whether they have intellect or not. Because intellect is obtained through the destruction and pacification of karma like Jnanavaraniya.
## Sutra-92
The soul, which has accumulated karma over countless births, uses it every moment, but through self-study, the accumulated karma of many births is consumed in an instant.
## Sutra-93
All beings, including Tiryanch, Sur, Asura, Manav, Kinnar, Mahorag, and Gandharva, who are in a state of delusion, should ask the Kevali Bhagwan. In other words, the only appropriate place to seek answers to one's curiosity in the world is a Kevalgyani.
## Sutra-94
One who attains human detachment through the hearing and contemplation of a single principle is also a Samyaggyani. Because whatever brings detachment is the true knowledge of that.
## Sutra-95
One who has attained intense detachment through a single principle on the path of the Vitarag Paramatama should not abandon that principle even until death.
## Sutra-96-97
Even the most powerful-minded Muni cannot contemplate the entire twelve-fold path at the time of death. Therefore, the one who contemplates even a single principle during that time and place, is considered an Aradhak by Jinendra.
## Sutra-98
A well-established Muni, by being focused in Aradhana, attains Samadhi and through the passage of time, surely attains liberation in three births. In other words, they attain Nirvana, the eternal state.
## Sutra-99
In this way, I have briefly described the great benefits of the specific qualities of Shrutagyan. Now, listen with a focused mind to the specific qualities of Charitra.
## Sutra-100
Those who are completely free from the bonds of household life, striving to follow the Dharma taught by Jinendra Bhagwan, are blessed.
## Sutra-101
The virtuous Muni, who follows the Jinavachan with a focused mind and pure intention, does not feel sadness or dejection even when facing death, despite the attainment of the state of Muni.
## Sutra-102
Those who have not stabilized their soul in this path of liberation, which is the only way to free oneself from suffering, are foolish to attain such a rare state of Shramanatva.

**Āgama Sūtra 30/2, Payannā Sūtra-7/2, Chandravedhyaka' Sūtra - 103**
Those who, with firm wisdom, become one-pointed in mind and search for the welfare of the other world, they cross over all human suffering. Sūtra-104
The man who, without negligence, destroys anger, pride, deceit, greed, aversion, and hatred in restraint, he certainly attains supreme happiness. Sūtra - 105
The human being who, having obtained the very rare human birth, does not make it meaningful, is like a ship captain who is very unhappy after the ship is wrecked. Sūtra - 106
The man who, having obtained the rare Śramaṇa Dharma, does not violate it by his mind, speech, and body, does not experience sorrow like a sailor who finds a ship in the ocean. Sūtra - 107, 108
_ First of all, it is rare to obtain human birth, it is rare to attain enlightenment in human birth. Even if enlightenment is attained, Śramaṇatva is very rare. Even after obtaining the status of a Sadhu, it is very rare to obtain the secret knowledge of the scriptures. After understanding the secret of knowledge, it is very rare to attain purity of character. Therefore, wise men are always striving for purity of character through criticism, etc. Sūtra-109
Some praise the virtues of Right Conduct, some praise the purity of character, and some praise Right Knowledge. Sūtra - 110-111
If both Right Conduct and character are attained together, which virtue should an intelligent man practice first? Right Conduct can be attained even without character. Just as King Kṛṣṇa and King Śreṇika had Right Conduct even in their non-restraint. But those who are virtuous have Right Conduct as a rule. Sūtra - 112
One who is corrupted by character should certainly adopt the superior Right Conduct. Because a being can become a Siddha even without having the substance of character, but a being without the qualities of perception cannot become a Siddha. Sūtra - 113
Even those who practice excellent character fall from the category of restraint due to some false conduct, then what is surprising if a Right-seeing person who is in the path of attachment falls from it? Sūtra - 114
The character of the Muni who has the intellect of five Samitis and three Guptis, and who does not have attachment and aversion, becomes pure. Sūtra - 115
Strive diligently in the work of observing Samitis and Guptis for the purification of that character. And then do not be negligent in the slightest in the practice of Right-seeing, character, and knowledge.

I have briefly described the qualities and great benefits of the Dharma of conduct. Now listen with a focused mind to the special qualities of Samadhi-Maraṇa. Sūtra-117-118

Just as an untrained man riding an uncontrolled horse might wish to defeat an enemy army, but that man and horse, not having been trained and practiced beforehand, are destroyed upon seeing the enemy army in battle. Sūtra - 119

Similarly, a Muni who has not previously practiced the Pariṣaha of hunger, etc., the suffering of Loca, etc., and Tapas, cannot bear the Pariṣaha, Upaśarga, and pain that come upon the body at the time of death with equanimity. Sūtra - 120

A Muni who has practiced Tapas, etc., beforehand and desires Samadhi, if he can restrain the desire for worldly pleasures, can bear the Pariṣaha with equanimity. Sūtra - 121

A Muni who has previously renounced all food, having practiced the prescribed methods of the scriptures, such as Vigaya, Uṇodari, and excellent Tapas, pierces the army of Pariṣaha at the time of death like a sharp axe. Sūtra - 122

A Muni who has not made great effort in upholding conduct beforehand experiences sensory pain at the time of death. It creates an obstacle to Samadhi. In this way, a Muni who has not practiced Tapas, etc., beforehand becomes cowardly and fearful at the time of final worship. Sūtra-123

Even a Muni who is a student of the Āgama, if he becomes attached to sensory pleasures, may or may not attain Samadhi at the time of death. If he remembers the words of the scriptures, he may attain Samadhi, but due to the inability to remember the words of the scriptures because of being under the control of sensory pleasures, he usually does not attain Samadhi. Sūtra - 124

Even a Muni who has little knowledge, if he has practiced Tapas, etc., well, can fulfill the vows of restraint and a good death without suffering and in a beautiful way. Sūtra - 125

A cowardly man, overwhelmed by the desire for sensory pleasures, bound by the power of severe Pariṣaha, and without the practice of Tapas, etc., becomes frightened at the time of final worship. Sūtra - 126

A Muni who has become virtuous by practicing difficult Tapas and restraint beforehand cannot be overcome by the army of Pariṣaha, which has been prevented by the power of fortitude at the time of death. Sūtra-127

A wise Muni who has practiced difficult Tapas and restraint beforehand, thinking carefully about his future benefit, free from the hope of Nidāna-Pauḍgalika pleasure, and without any restrictions regarding any substance, field, etc., practices the acceptable Samadhi Yoga well.

Taking the bow, drawing it back, and fitting the arrow, the man with a steady mind towards the target, thinking about his training, binds the Rādha-vedhya. Sūtra - 129
But if that archer makes the mistake of taking his mind away from the target, even though he is committed, he cannot pierce the Rādha’s Chandraka-like vedhya. Sūtra - 130
Like the Chandravedhya, one should make one’s soul an unwavering, virtuous, and devoted Ārādhaka in order to attain samadhi at the time of death. Sūtra - 131
The death of a Muni at the end is pure, with the firmness of Samyagdarshana, a pure intellect, and the criticism and condemnation of self-created sins. Sūtra - 132
I have come to criticize all the offenses that have been committed against me in the matters of knowledge, vision, and conduct, which Śrī Jineśvara Bhagavān knows directly. Sūtra - 133
The man who stops and removes the two sins of attachment and aversion, which bind the world and are related to the soul, will certainly become free from negligence and attain samadhi at the time of death. Sūtra - 134
The man who controls the soul with the knowledge-goad of the three dands, by keeping it secret, can remain steadfast and attain samadhi at the time of death. Sūtra - 135
The man who always controls the terrible passions like anger, etc., which arise in his own body, as taught by Jineśvara Bhagavān, achieves the state of equanimity at death. Sūtra - 136
The wise man who controls the senses, which are excessively attached to objects, with the goad of knowledge, becomes one who attains samadhi at the time of death. Sūtra - 137
The Muni, who is benevolent towards the six living beings, free from the seven fears of this world and beyond, and has a very gentle and soft nature, constantly experiences the natural state of equanimity and becomes one who achieves perfect samadhi at the time of death. Sūtra - 138
Those who have conquered the eight intoxications, who are protected by the new secrecy of celibacy, who are engaged in the practice of the ten vows of the Yati Dharma, such as forgiveness, etc., will certainly attain the state of equanimity and samadhi at the time of death. Sūtra - 139
He who desires the worship of this very rare path of liberation, who avoids the desires of gods, gurus, etc., or who has become face-to-face with the white meditation through the continuous practice of Dharma meditation, will certainly attain samadhi at death.

A Muni who endures twenty-two Pariṣaha and unbearable afflictions in a deserted place, village, town, etc., can also endure them in samadhi at the time of death. Sūtra - 141
The kṣaya of a blessed person, despite being confronted by the kṣaya of anger, etc., of others, does not desire to stand up like a crippled human being who is well-seated. Sūtra - 142, 143
I believe that the śramaṇatva of a virtuous person who practices śramaṇadharma is futile like the flower of a śeladī if their kṣaya is of a high order.
Even a pure character cultivated for a few years in the past is lost in a moment by a man with a polluted mind due to kṣaya. Sūtra - 144
The karma earned through the fault of heedlessness for an infinite period is consumed by a Muni who conquers and destroys attachment and aversion only in a koti of past years. Sūtra-145
If a yogi who has attained the category of upasama with subdued kṣaya falls into degradation countless times, then why should one trust the remaining little kṣaya? Sūtra - 146
If the kṣaya of anger, etc., has been destroyed, then only consider oneself to be safe and well, just as if the kṣaya is alive, then know the true victory, if the kṣaya is defeated, then consider that fearlessness has been attained, and if the kṣaya is completely destroyed, then know that indestructible happiness will surely be attained. Sūtra - 147
Blessed are those virtuous ones who always remain immersed in the Jina's words, conquer the kṣaya, have no attachment to external objects, and wander freely in the path of restraint, becoming detached and devoid of cruelty. Sūtra - 140
Blessed are those great Munis who are absorbed in the path of liberation, who are endowed with inexhaustible virtues, and who wander without restraint in this world or the next, in life or death. Sūtra-149
A wise person should make a strong effort to attain right faith by vomiting out wrong faith at the time of death. Sūtra-150-151
It is unfortunate that even great patient men, at the time of powerful death, become overwhelmed by the intense pain of death and attain the state of wrong faith. Therefore, a wise Muni should remember all the sins committed from the day of initiation in the presence of the Guru and cleanse them by criticizing, condemning, and discarding them. Sūtra - 152
At that time, the Guru Bhagavan should give the appropriate atonement, and accepting it willingly and considering it the Guru's grace, say, "O Bhagavan! I want to perform the atonement-tapas given by you. You have freed me from sin." Muni Diparatnasāgar Kr̥t “(Chandravedhyaka)” Āgama Sūtra-Hindi Translation"

My soul is one, eternal, full of knowledge and vision. The rest, all external things like body, etc., are born from the relationship of association. ..... I am one, I belong to no one, or I am not anyone's. I cannot see who I belong to, and there is nothing that is mine. Sutra - 162-163
In the past, due to the fault of ignorance, I have attained divinity, humanity, animal birth, and hellish existence countless times. But due to suffering, I have not attained satisfaction or perfect purity through my own karma. Sutra - 164
Those humans who are negligent in the religion that liberates, wander in this terrifying ocean of the world for a long time. Sutra - 165
Those humans with firm intellect who do not abandon the path of Jina's words, which was practiced by the previous men, cross all suffering. Sutra - 166

At the time of death, neither mother, father, relatives, nor dear friends can become a support, meaning they cannot save one from death. Sutra - 168, 169
Silver, gold, slaves, maidservants, chariots, bullock carts, or palanquins, etc., none of these external things are of any use to a person at the time of death, they cannot provide support.
Horsepower, elephant power, military power, bow power, chariot power, etc., none of these external protectors can save a human from death. Sutra - 170
In this way, by removing the afflictions, the soul, by worshipping the Samadhi-death as spoken by the Jinas, becomes pure. Sutra - 171
Even a Muni who knows the remedy for the transgression-faults that occur in vows, should purify his own afflictions only through a Guru or other witness. Sutra - 172
Just as a skilled physician, when treating himself, consults another physician and takes the medicine prescribed by him, similarly, a Sadhu reveals his faults to a proper Guru and purifies them. Sutra - 173

O seeker of liberation! By listening to the method of humility, the qualities of an Acharya, the qualities of a disciple, the qualities of humility-control, the qualities of knowledge, the qualities of feet, and the qualities of death, you should behave in such a way that you can be completely free from the fall of womb-dwelling, death, rebirth, birth, and evil destiny.
