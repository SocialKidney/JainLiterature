## Introduction

This Trivarnachar treatise is authored by Shri Somasen Suri. The treatise primarily describes the conduct of the three varnas (castes). Incidentally, the treatise also describes the conduct of the Yatis (ascetics).  Occasionally, it also mentions the conduct of the Shudras.  The treatise encompasses daily activities from waking up to going to bed, with great skill and finesse. The original treatise is in Sanskrit. This Hindi translation is presented to the readers along with the original. It is hoped that at least some Dharma-loving gentlemen will benefit from it.

## Acknowledgements

I have translated this treatise at the behest of Babu Biharilalji Kathneraki. Although the translation was completed over several years, the translation of the first 10 chapters had to be done very quickly due to the publisher's urgency. In the intervening years, the translated portions were printed as they were completed. When that was finished, the publisher's demand resumed, so the remaining part also had to be done quickly. Therefore, due to haste, there are some errors in the translation, and some errors are due to ignorance. I wanted to completely rectify these errors in the appendix, but due to lack of time, I could not do so completely. Therefore, I request the readers to try to understand the erroneous passages according to the Jain Agamas.

## Apologies

This translation was done from a printed copy, which was printed several years ago along with a Marathi translation and contains many errors. I also received a handwritten copy after a considerable portion of the translation was completed, but it was only with me for a short time and is also quite inaccurate. However, several passages were corrected from it, and many were corrected from other texts, but many passages remain incorrect. For this too, I apologize to the readers.

## Further Apologies

I also want to apologize regarding the editing of the treatise. The treatise has been edited by different people at different times, as they pleased. The editors have left the Sanskrit original verses in some places and removed them in others. They have also left out other parts of the text here and there. Some sentences and verses that should have been placed below have been placed above, and vice versa. As far as I know, the editors have also changed the translation in many places. It would have been better if the editing had been done by one person.

## Personal Reflections

Although I had faith in the canonical texts from the beginning, as I began to unravel their intricacies, I became increasingly fascinated by them. I began to see the deceit and hypocrisy of people... 

Page #9:
---------------------------
No untruthful subject was found in those texts. I was saddened and found an example of how people distort those texts in ways they don't want. Well, whatever it may be, their distortions have made my faith in the Jain Agamas even stronger. Pandit Dhannalalji Kashliwal, the Khandelkulbhushan, is also responsible for my increased interest. By his grace, I have received much enlightenment on this subject, therefore I dedicate this work to his lotus hands.

Introduction of the author. The author of this text, Pattacharya Somasen Maharaj, was the head of the Pushkar Gachchha under the Mula Sangh. His guru's name was Gunabhadra Suri. He has not given any introduction about which place he adorned with his birth and where he was the head of the throne. Only that he completed this text in VS 1667. Therefore, the time of Somasen Suri should be considered as the 17th century of Vikram. Apart from this, we are unable to give his special introduction.

Knowledge and conduct of the author. .. The study of the text reveals that the author was a good scholar of Jain scriptures. He appears to be a good scholar of Mantra Shastra, Jyotish Shastra, Vaidyak Shastra, Nimitta Shastra and Shakun Shastra. He also had extraordinary speed in his conduct, he looked at those who practiced conduct with a high vision. The verses at the end of many chapters of this text are witnesses to this subject. He was also a unique ascetic. He has greatly inspired the practice of restraint in various places. Although he was a Bhattarak, he was not like the Bhattaraks of today, he was a good scholar and an ascetic. Those who get irritated just by hearing the name Bhattarak are making a big mistake.

Religious faith of the author. .. There are many subjects whose tradition has been lost, today, due to the lack of study of the texts, they have started to appear to people as if they are not part of Jainism. Therefore, people immediately say that this does not seem to be Jainism. This is what the author has taken from other religions, etc. On this subject, we have only this to say that they are still ignorant of the vast Jain literature. There are such things in the Jain literature written by the sages that they have neither heard nor seen. They also say about the Mahapurana, which contains the statement of the sacraments, that Jinsen Swami has taken this subject of sacraments from the Brahmin sect. When such imaginations have arisen even about those revered sages, then it is easy to imagine such things about Somasen. He will only accept those things from other religions which he is interested in and wants to make Jains followers of other religions. But we see that Somasen Suri had no interest in other religions, nor did he want to make Jains followers of other religions. He even advises them to remain silent from those who follow other religions. In such a situation, how can they teach Jains the teachings of other religions? As, . 

Page #10:
---------------------------
"Those who are foolish, arrogant, and devoid of Jain Dharma, who engage in baseless arguments, should be abandoned by those who are devoted to silence. The author of this text has praised gods, gurus, scriptures, and temples in many places. This reveals their extraordinary devotion to Jain Dharma. They had immense respect for Jainism in their hearts. As it is said:

"One should console the sick, the suffering, and those who have taken refuge in Jain Dharma with kind words and gestures."

While the author of this text shows aversion to other religions and affection for Jain Dharma, it is unclear why they are being falsely accused. This only proves that this text obstructs the selfish desires of certain individuals. Therefore, to clear their path, they first resort to these deceptions. Our examination of the text reveals that the author had immense devotion to Jain Dharma and avoided irrelevant topics. People, for their own selfish gains, accuse them of being against the caste system.

**The Authenticity of the Text**

We have no doubt about the authenticity of this text. If the topics discussed were not in accordance with Jain principles and contradicted their teachings, then there might be reason to doubt its authenticity. The foundation of this text is based on ancient Puranas. The topics discussed in this text are also found in the works of those whose writings the author has referenced. In fact, the topics of this text are found in the Agamas compiled by the Rishis, sometimes in brief and sometimes in detail. Therefore, we find no lack of authenticity or contradiction with the Agamas in this text. However, those who are unfamiliar with the caste system, unable to follow it, and have no connection to its tradition, will be shocked upon seeing the topics discussed in this text. Those who consider the caste system a mere sham will undoubtedly call this text deceitful and written by a charlatan. Those whose minds are offended by the very names of Bhattaraka and the three-fold caste system will surely accuse it of being inauthentic and contradictory to the Agamas. There is no doubt about this.

Those who consider the Puranas like Padma Purana, Harivansh Purana, Maha Purana, and Yasastilakachanmpu, the mantra scriptures like Vidyaanuvaad, Vidhaanushasan, Bhairavapadmavatikalp, and Jwalamalini Kalp, the worship scriptures like Indranandi Pratiṣṭhāpāṭha, Vasunandi Pratiṣṭhāpāṭha, Ashadhar Pratiṣṭhāpāṭha, Nemichandra Pratiṣṭhāpāṭha, and Akalank Pratiṣṭhāpāṭha, the ethical texts like Ratnakaranḍaka, Moolaachaar, Aachaarsar Dharmaamrit, the scriptures on the organization of the universe like Trilokprajnapti and Triloksar, and every single topic of Jain Dharma as inauthentic and false, will naturally consider this text inauthentic and deceitful.

When even those who claim to be Jains, not to mention non-Jains, consider Jain Dharma, a religion that promotes well-being, as false, it is not surprising that those who disregard this ordinary text can be found in this world!"

Page #11:
---------------------------
In Jain scriptures, tradition is given a very high place. Those teachings that are in accordance with the tradition of the word are considered external and authentic. Those teachings that disregard tradition are considered unruly and are never acceptable or considered evidence. Somasen Maharaj has bowed his head before tradition. As stated:

"Whatever has been said by the worthy Ganis, the Samanta Bhadra, the Siddhanta by Gunabhadra Nath Muni, Bhattakalanka, and others, by the wise Sri Suri Dvija, the name of the eloquent, I have composed this scripture, which is full of the essence of Dharma, in three colors."

This scripture is a collection of scriptures. Ancient verses from other scriptures have been quoted in it. It would not be an exaggeration to say that all the verses that expound the subject matter are from other scriptures. A collection of practical verses like "Mrittika-Shuddhi" which uphold equality according to Jainism has also been included in it. The author himself acknowledges this. As stated:

"These verses, which are ancient, have been written by us, they are like lamps that illuminate the composition of poetry, but if I had done something new in the way of various scriptures and doctrines, then some wise people would have said that I am a magician."

While it contains a collection of such verses, it is possible that they may have written something contrary to the public Dharma. It is also natural to suspect this. Because they were also people, just as we think about it step by step, so did they. Just as we (the men of the present time) have sympathy with Jainism, so did they. It is not that we alone are concerned with the suitability and unsuitability of public opinion, and they did not. It is not that we alone (the men of the present) have taken the contract of Jainism and they have turned away from this contract. In short, their point of view was the same as ours. Therefore, the above suspicion is of no use.

**Statement and Objection:**

This scripture mainly deals with the conduct of the Paakshik Trivarnik. The conduct of the Naishthik Shravak and Muni is also found in it briefly. There are many subjects that are worthy of being followed in their own place, and there are many that are worthy of being followed in the higher order in the form of rules, but are also followed in the lower order in the form of practice, and there are many subjects that are followed in both the upper and lower orders, but the basic conduct of the place is not abandoned. Many people understand the rules and prohibitions that are for the Muni, for the Naishthik and Paakshik, and those that are for the Naishthik, for the Paakshik as well. They completely forget this idea that this rule and prohibition is for whom and for whom it is not, or that it is for this person, how do I plan it for that person. Such people fall into a hypothetical side - 1 Its meaning is seen on page 3, verse no. 9. 

Page #12:
---------------------------
(5) They go around and make the path thorny by creating chaos and confusion. There are many topics that are prescribed for the Paakshik and prohibited for the Naishthik, yet due to their lack of understanding, they start using the prohibitions for the Naishthik for the Paakshik as well. Take the example of serving the rulers. It is prohibited for the Naishthik to serve the rulers during times of calamity. This prohibition is for the Naishthik, not for the Paakshik, because the Paakshik can serve the rulers during times of calamity. Even though this is the case, these people apply this statement for the Naishthik to the Paakshik as well. Another point is that this prohibition for the Naishthik is during times of calamity, not while worshipping the Jineendra Dev, yet it is applied to everyone at all times. If those who do this were to follow the rules and prohibitions with expectations, it would be much better. Therefore, I request the readers to keep in mind while understanding the topics described in the text, for whom the prohibition is meant elsewhere and for whom the prescription is meant here. If they abandon expectations, the same confusion will remain. Without expectations, even all practical actions can be considered false. Therefore, every individual should keep expectations in mind while reading the text.

Many topics in this text have been made controversial and are heavily criticized. If one delves deep into Jain principles and has faith in them, all these criticisms can be resolved. All the criticisms that are made are done without understanding, just to promote their own side. It would be pointless to respond to them here.

**Special Discussion:** It is well-known in scriptures that:

> "If the three goals (Dharma, Artha, and Kama) are pursued without hindering each other, then one attains effortless happiness and liberation in due course."

When it is said that effortless happiness and liberation are attained by pursuing all three, then the nature of the three and the means of pursuing them must also be explained. Therefore, in the world, Dharma Shastra, Artha Shastra, and Kama Shastra are known independently. Some scriptures preach Dharma, some explain the means of earning wealth, and some explain the methods of enjoying desires. There are also some scriptures where Dharma preaching is the main focus, and the preaching of Artha and Kama is secondary. This Trivarnaachar is a text that explains all the actions of the three categories from morning to evening. Therefore, the methods of earning wealth and enjoying desires are also included in these actions. This is why the methods of earning wealth and enjoying desires are also mentioned in this text in a seed form. Seeing this, many people get upset and ask why the description of Kama is in Dharma Shastras? The answer to this question is that this text is not only about preaching Dharma. 

Page #13:
---------------------------
( .6 )
It does not only explain the Dharma but also the methods of earning wealth and enjoying sensual pleasures in a seed form. Because this is a treatise on the conduct of the three varnas. The conduct of the three varnas is Dharma, wealth, and sensual pleasure. Therefore, it is not inappropriate to describe wealth and sensual pleasure in a seed form. Their detailed description should be known from the scriptures on that subject. But one should definitely keep in mind that the earning of wealth and the enjoyment of sensual pleasures should be done in accordance with Dharma. Wealth earned and sensual pleasures enjoyed in accordance with Dharma can only lead to boundless happiness, otherwise, they are the cause of terrible hell. The publisher of this treatise, out of great compassion, has added his own commentary on the verses related to the science of sensual pleasure, considering them obscene. This is not right. Obscene talk is one thing and the description of the science of sensual pleasure is another.

This scripture also mentions a little bit about medicine, astrology, omens, signs, health protection, etc. Only the terrifying statements made about eating betel nuts, marrying a girl with a bad name, etc., are not contradictory to the scriptures on those subjects! Those who start a fierce battle over such things are, firstly, ignorant of the scriptures on that subject, and secondly, they do not want to be subservient to those scriptures today. Therefore, they want to clear their path by any means. I do not find any subject of this treatise to be contrary to the scriptures. The seeds of all the subjects mentioned in this scripture are found in the scriptures written by the sages. Therefore, I do not have the courage to disregard this treatise, which is for the welfare of ordinary society. I also believe that many virtuous people will be shocked, angry, curse, and break like lightning after seeing this translation, and will also tell many stories. But -

"Even if a king is greedy, he should not abandon truth and righteousness. What is the use of a king who abandons truth and righteousness?" - Darshanasara.

Finally, I request the readers to correct any errors in the translation of the treatise and forgive me. Because -

"Even a wise man may stumble and fall due to carelessness." - Translator.

Take the prasook water from the reservoir into a vessel, sit properly with both hands between both thighs and perform the purification with that water.
Page 33, verse no. 37:
Do not perform the purification of the anus inside the reservoir, but take separate purified water in a vessel and perform the purification with it. If you do not take separate water in a vessel and perform the purification in the reservoir itself, then sit at a distance of about one hand from the water while performing the purification. Here, in place of "Galiten Pavitren", there is also a reading "Ratnamaatra Jalantyakta".

Meaning - This is a quoted verse. According to Jain principles, its meaning is only this - the one who makes a noise should throw the noise of his mouth to his left - not to his right.

Meaning - This section is about Tarpan. Further on pages 81, 82 and 83 are the mantras for Rishi Tarpan, Pit Tarpan and Jayadi Devtas. Apart from these, there is no mantra for giving water to the ancestors by squeezing the cloth. And in verse no. 12, it is written to squeeze the cloth with a mantra and after Tarpan, there is cloth-sprinkling and cloth-wearing. The number of squeezing the cloth comes later. But here, in the middle, it is written "giving water squeezed from the cloth". This makes it seem as if someone has perhaps inserted verses no. 11, 12, 13, after finding the section or someone has

It is possible that some verses have been included in the original text due to errors by the authors, even though they were originally written in the commentary. Often, variations are seen in different copies of this text. There are many verses that are not present in the printed Marathi book but are found in other copies. Similarly, it is possible that there may be a copy that does not contain these verses. Even if they are present, they are not considered objectionable.
On page 53, verse no. 17: -
Meaning - The meaning of this verse is simply that the body should not be wiped after wearing clothes. Therefore, ordinary people are only advised not to wipe themselves using this method. Or verses no. 17-18-19 seem to be quoted. Or, according to the subject matter, someone may have added them in a haphazard manner or they may have been included in the original text from the commentary. It is possible that this is what happened. Because it has often been seen that the text of the commentary also appears in the original due to errors by the authors. Therefore, whatever the case may be, only the meaning of these verses should be taken. The meaning is simply that after bathing and wearing clothes, the body should not be wiped.
On page 55, verse no. 26:
Blue colored cloth is to be abandoned from afar, i.e. Shravakas should never wear cloth dyed blue. But if women wear blue clothes while sleeping during sexual intercourse, there is no fault.
On page 57, verse no. 57:
After drying the cloth on dry wood, it becomes pure by performing Achaman twice. Therefore, dry the washed clothes in the east or north direction.
On page 72, verses no. 113, 114:
Perform the Panchnamaskaar mantra one hundred and eight, fifty-four or twenty-seven times according to your convenience. By chanting the Panchnamaskaar mantra nine times, taking a break after two and one pada, there are twenty-seven utterances. Meaning - "Arhadvayo Namah Siddhebyo Namah" say these two pada and take a short break, then "Aachaaryebhyo Namah Upaadhyaayebhyo Namah" say these two pada and take a short break, then "Saadhubhyo Namah" say this one pada and take a break. Thus, there are three utterances in one Panchnamaskaar mantra, and twenty-seven utterances in nine Panchnamaskaars. By performing the above-mentioned chanting of the Panchnamaskaar mantra according to this method, all sins are destroyed.
On page 103, verses no. 109-110:  Leaving the previous Brahmabhagas, build three kunds in the east-facing Manushbhagas and Devbhagas of the subsequent Brahmabhagas. In the middle of those three kunds, build a square kund that is one aratnipramaan long, as wide and as deep, with three mekhala (cuts) drawn around it.

**Illuminating Statement**

Especially since the publication of articles on the critique of books related to Shravakaachar written by Shri Jugalkishorji Mukhtar, there has been a lot of debate in the Digambar Jain community regarding many passages from the Trivarnaachar book.

About four years ago, the director of this office, the late Pandit Udayalalji Kashliwal, had this thought: "Brothers who are interested in self-study but don't know Sanskrit will surely be interested in studying the Trivarnaachar book if it were translated. " Therefore, after discussing with us, the late Panditji decided to publish this book with a Hindi translation and entrusted the task of translation to Shri Pandit Pannalalji Soni.

Just a few days after the printing of this book began, we left for our hometown, Harda, with the intention of staying there and started a khadi factory. After only a few forms of the book were printed, our friend Pandit Udayalalji Kashliwal's health deteriorated, and so we called him to Harda for a change of air and medical treatment. He stayed there for a month. From there, he went to Wardha and then Nashik for medical treatment, but he did not recover. Sadly, he passed away in Nashik. The loss this office has suffered due to the demise of this great literary devotee will not be hidden from the readers of the many books published during his time. Especially, the books you translated, Shri Nemipuran, Bhaktamar Katha (including mantras and yantras), Nagkumar Charit, Yashodhar Charit, Pavan Dhoot (poetry), Khudarshan Charit, Shrenik Charit Saar, and Sukumal Charit Saar, have been published by this office. The publication of new translations of Shri Pandav Puran, Samyaktvakaumudi, and Chandra Prabha Charit in such a good form is also the result of your efforts. Besides these, many Jain books like Shri Bhadra Bahu Charit, Dhanyakumar Charit, Dharmasangrah Shravakaachar, Ar/Dhanasar Katha Kash, Nemicharit (poetry), Sanshay Timir Pradeep, Vanvasini, etc., translated or written by the late Panditji, have been published by different publishers and individuals. Of course, we did not agree with the late Pandit Udayalalji Kashliwal's views in his later life, and as a result of those views, we have no connection with that work. However, we can never forget the invaluable service he rendered to Digambar Jain literature and the Digambar Jain community through this office, and for that, this office and the Digambar Jain community will always be indebted to him.

The demise of our friend Pandit Udayalalji and our absence from here for a year and a half after that caused such a delay in the publication of this book. We apologize to the readers for this.

From the above statement, it is clear that this mantra has been published for about four years. It has been compiled by two different scholars at different times. However, after the entire month had passed, the translator found two inaccuracies in the beginning and end of the text, which he corrected. He also corrected the translation of some shlokas which were incorrect, and these corrections are published along with the text. The reader should make the necessary corrections according to these corrections and then study the text.
We will definitely say something more about the subject of this text and its translation. The translator has described the conduct and actions of all three varnas from birth to death in simple language with great effort. Therefore, even if we ignore the controversial points for a while, this text is very useful for householders and is worthy of being read by every Jain.
Finally, we cannot thank the translator enough for accepting our request and translating this text. Without your help, we would have been unable to publish it.

_ Salutations to the glorious Vitrag. The Trivarna Achar composed by Sri Somasen Bhattarak.
Chapter One.
Invocation. . . Salutations to the radiant, pure feet of Sri Chandra Prabha Deva Deva, ...
The saviors from the ocean of existence, the auspicious ones, bestowing Dharma, Artha, and Kama. I will speak of the supreme, auspicious scripture, the Trivarna Achar, which is the developer of the conduct of the four varnas, and a giver of wealth.
By hearing which, the auspicious humans, desiring the happiness of heaven and beyond, will become virtuous. || 1 ||
. Those who are the cause of the attainment of these three Purusharthas, Dharma, Artha, and Kama, who are the givers of happiness, and who are the saviors of the auspicious humans from the ocean of existence, I will speak of the supreme, auspicious scripture, the Trivarna Achar, bowing to the radiant, pure feet of Sri Chandra Prabha Deva. This scripture is the giver of merit and reveals the daily and occasional conduct of the three varnas, Brahmana, Kshatriya, and Vaishya. By hearing which, the auspicious humans, desiring the happiness of heaven and beyond, will follow the supreme path. || 1 ||
.
He who is like the one sun, the joy of the lineage of the glorious Hari Vamsa, . . . Those who are devoted to Dharma, endowed with virtues, they are always his refuge. . . The Muni-janas, the righteous, serve him with joy, the developer of knowledge and meditation. . .
May that glorious Muni Suvrata, the Jina Pati, grant the fulfillment of our desires. || 2 || . .

##  Translation:

**Verse 2:**

Just as the sun nurtures the lotus, so too is the unique sun, the Harivaṃśa-lotus, who is the refuge of all virtuous souls, their protector, the one who enhances their knowledge and meditation, and whose service is performed by the munis. May Śrī Muni Suvrata Nāth fulfill my heart's desires. || 2 ||

**Verse 3:**

I bow to Pārśvanāth, who crushed the pride of Kamaṭha, the lamp illuminating all truths, the destroyer of karmic enemies, the compassionate one, whose lotus feet are served by countless Indras. The serpent king bears his feet on his head, holding a parasol over his head. His liberation-wealth desires, with great joy, an unparalleled desire every day. || 3 ||

**Verse 4:**

I salute Śrī Vardhamāna, along with the assembly of munis, who, through the seven-fold application of the seven categories of existence (saptabhaṅga), has expounded the nine substances and seven principles with sharp reasoning. Just as a seed is the cause of the growth of a tree, so too is he the cause of the birth of supreme knowledge, possessing nine types of nayas, being the form of proof, bestowing liberation-wealth, and being of the nature of anekanta. I bow to that last Jina, Śrī Vardhamāna. || 4 ||

**Verse 5:**

I worship Sarasvatī, who ensures the happiness of all beings, the mother of joy, the destroyer of ignorance, the revealer of truths, the giver of good wisdom, and the one who works to bring about the welfare and happiness of all beings. || 5 ||

##  Trivarnika Achar

I bow to Acharya Jinaseen, who has filled everyone with the pure fragrance of his character, who is a Kalpavriksha fulfilling the desires of his disciples, who shows the path to the essential happiness in the afterlife, who has reached the end of the principles; and just as grains become lush with water, so too does the group of Bhavyas rejoice in his knowledge-water, who is served by the best of the virtuous, who grants the highest position, and who is adorned with the three jewels. || 6 ||

May the great Kundakunda, the destroyer of the evils of Kaliyuga, the revered Muni, who takes us across the ocean of existence, the treasure of virtues, the great among Yogis, the virtuous Gunabhadra, and the pure Siddhasena, who is victorious with his adherence to rules, be victorious. || 7 ||

May the two feet of Maheendrakirti, who has reached the end of the ocean of principles and who is compassionate towards his disciples, always reside in my heart, bringing happiness. || 8 ||

Seeing what has been said by the learned Jinaseen, Samantabhadra, Gunabhadra, Bhattakalkak, Brahmasuri, and the eloquent Ashadhar, I am composing this Dharma-loving scripture, which is based on the three classes. || 9 ||

Those who are engaged in the vow and austerity of the development of knowledge are Brahmanas... Those who are self-reliant and who do not abandon their refuge are Kshatriyas. 

Page #43:

Composed by Somasen Bhattaraka
Wise Vaishyas are known on earth, who are skilled in the discernment of Dharma and Adharma, I will separately explain their knowledge and conduct in detail. || 10 ||
Those who cultivate self-knowledge, are virtuous and practice austerities are called Brahmanas. Those who protect the helpless are considered Kshatriyas. And those who are proficient in examining Dharma and Adharma are Vaishyas. Therefore, their knowledge and conduct are said to be distinct. || 10 || Description of the virtuous and the wicked |
Good people do not care about the wicked by nature, they consider the trouble caused by the wicked as insignificant, just like a piece of cotton is consumed by the flame of a fire, but the fire itself is extinguished in the presence of water. || 11 ||
It is the nature of the wicked to cause trouble to the virtuous on earth, but it is also the nature of the virtuous to not care about them at all; rather, the wicked themselves are ashamed. So it is right that the flame of a fire of straw burns cotton, but it is extinguished in the presence of water. In short, if someone wicked finds fault with this composition of ours, we do not care. Even a little trouble from the wicked makes the wicked men tired and hesitant in their duty, but the great men complete what they have started, no matter how much trouble they face. || 11 ||
The virtuous always adopt the virtues of the virtuous, and the wicked adopt their vices,
May the virtuous be endowed with virtues,
All their own vices should be considered. || 12 ||
Let the wicked man take my faults upon himself. Those faults are his wealth, therefore I do not stop him from taking his own wealth; because even after repeated requests, he will never accept my virtues. || 13 ||
A poet knows the labor of poetry by a good poet,
A non-poet, who is incapable of composing poetry, cannot know it,
Just as a barren woman cannot know the pain of childbirth, but a woman who gives birth knows it. || 14 || 

Page #44:
---------------------------
## Trivarna Achar

**15.**  A person who lacks the intelligence to discern virtues and vices, who is incapable of praise or blame, and yet speaks about them, is merely a laughingstock. Just as it is ridiculous to discuss the appearance of a blind person born blind, so too is it ridiculous to hear such a person speak about virtues and vices.

**16.** In this age of Kali, poets merely compose poetry, but the virtuous spread its virtues far and wide. In doing so, they indirectly promote their own virtues. Just as water gives rise to lotuses and the wind carries their fragrance far and wide, so too does the nature of things often work in such a way that one person performs an action and another benefits from it.

**17.** The noble ones, following the teachings of the Jinesvara, preach the essence of the Dharma. All the words and their meanings are ancient. Therefore, just as the Jinesvara used certain words to express certain meanings, so too do the Acharyas. Poets should not criticize these teachings.

**18.** If, due to carelessness, a composition violates the rules of prosody or grammar, the virtuous should discard it. They should accept only that which is beautiful and well-composed.

**19.** Even if a wicked person is adorned with virtues, one should avoid him. Is a serpent adorned with a jewel on its head any less dangerous? In essence, one should stay away from a wicked person, even if he is adorned with virtues, just as one would stay away from a serpent adorned with jewels.

##  Characteristics of a Speaker

www.
**Composed by Saman Sen Bhattaraka**

wow....... . . .  Characteristics of a Speaker. ... ... .. ... ... . He should be well-versed in the knowledge of all philosophies;
The speaker should be wise, pure, desiring liberation and happiness, clearly explaining the truth. ... He should be free from greed, pure in speech, concerned with the welfare of all beings, free from anger,
free from pride, obedient to the Yamas, fearful of the cycle of birth and death, and virtuous in worldly conduct. ||20|| .. He is a good speaker who knows all philosophies, is intelligent,

## Characteristics of a Text

A text in which there are nine categories of objects, ten categories of virtues, one or many,
the principles of soul and non-soul, good conduct, philosophy, knowledge, and conduct. ... Meditation, increase in detachment, stories of good kings, Chakravartin, Narayana, ...
Such a text is authentic, while any other text born from the mouths of people is a mere story. ||21|| The true scripture is one that contains the nine categories of objects, such as merit and demerit, the ten virtues, such as supreme forgiveness, the seven principles, such as soul and non-soul, good conduct, philosophy, knowledge, conduct, and meditation, which increases detachment, and the biographies of the sixty-three great beings, such as Tirthankaras, Chakravartins, and Narayana. And apart from this, stories told by humans, containing only entertainment, etc., are all mere stories. ||21||

## Characteristics of a Listener

A listener who is righteous, meditative, compassionate, adorned with the jewels of vows and virtues, is indeed a good listener,
He is a renunciant, an enjoyer, devoted to the words of the Jinas, endowed with knowledge and wisdom. Free from criticism and praise, he is like a bee at the lotus feet of the Guru, prosperous,
He understands the meaning of the true scriptures, desires liberation and happiness, is wise, and has good discernment. ||22|| A listener worthy of hearing the scriptures is one who is righteous, practices meditation, is compassionate, adorned with the jewels of vows like non-violence, and virtues like right faith, is a renunciant, an enjoyer, has a good interest in Jain scriptures, is endowed with knowledge and wisdom, does not criticize or praise anyone, is like a bee at the lotus feet of the Guru, is prosperous, understands the meaning of the true scriptures, desires liberation and happiness, is wise, and has good discernment. ||22||

##  Translation:

**Chapter 25**

This is equivalent to a cat. Just as a cat hates its own kind, so are those listeners who hate other listeners, like cats. Just as a leech only likes blood, so are those listeners who do not like good things and are only attracted to bad things, like leeches. All these are despicable listeners. In summary, the best listeners, after hearing the scriptures, benefit themselves and others. The average listeners, although they do not benefit themselves or others, do not hinder the religious service of others. And the most despicable listeners, far from benefiting, harm themselves and others. Therefore, these despicable listeners are not at all worthy of reading scriptures, listening to scriptural lectures, etc. || 25 ||

**Chapter 26**

**Introduction:**

Samayika, Shouch, Sandhyavidhi, Puja, Mantra, Food, Method of earning wealth, Garbhadhana, etc., thirty-three practices, Yajnopaveet, instructions on vows, marriage, Muni-vat and Sutak, these thirteen topics will be discussed in this book in thirteen separate chapters. || 26 ||

**Chapter 27**

The qualities of the speaker, the qualities of the scriptures, and the qualities of the listeners have been clearly explained in order. Now, the thirteen topics, which were promised in the previous verse, are being discussed in order. || 27 ||

**Samayika**

Now, I will speak about the meditation that is explained in detail in the ocean of knowledge, the scriptures. It is of four types: Artha, Roudra, Dharma, and Shukla. Of these, Artha and Roudra meditation are causes of suffering, while Dharma and Shukla meditation are causes of happiness. There are also four types of meditation: Pindasya, Padhastha, Roopastha, and Roopateet. And, each of the above types of meditation, like Artha meditation, has four objects of meditation, so there are four types of each according to its own subject. || 28 || 

Page #48:
---------------------------
## Trivarnika Achar:

**Aartdhyan and its types:**

Aartdhyan is of four types:

1. **Istaviyogja Aartdhyan:**  Thinking about how to regain lost loved ones like children, wife, etc.
2. **Anistasanjogja Aartdhyan:** Thinking about getting rid of undesirable things like poison, thorns, enemies, etc.
3. **Nidanjanja Aartdhyan:** Thinking about future enjoyments.
4. **Vednajanja Aartdhyan:** Thinking about physical pain.

These types of Aartdhyan are the root of sins and lead to the cycle of birth and death (tiryag gati). Therefore, it is best to avoid them completely.

**Roudradhyan and its types:**

A person who sees suffering beings in the world and instead of feeling compassion, becomes cruel and inflicts pain on them is called Rudra. The meditation of such a person is called Roudradhyan. It is of four types:

1. **Hinsananada:** Finding joy in violence.
2. **Mrishananda:** Finding joy in lying.
3. **Steyananda:** Finding joy in stealing.
4. **Parigrahananda:** Finding joy in protecting possessions.

Roudradhyan should be avoided at all costs.

**Dharmadhyan and its types:**

Dharmadhyan is of four types:

1. **Agyavichay:**  Firm belief in the truth as stated by the Jina.
2. **Apaya Vichay:**  Understanding the dangers of the cycle of birth and death.
3. **Vipak Vichay:**  Understanding the consequences of actions.
4. **Sansthan Vichay:**  Understanding the nature of reality.

These four types of Dharmadhyan are beneficial and lead to the well-being of all beings.

**Agyavichay:**

Agyavichay is the Dharmadhyan that involves firm belief in the truth as stated by the Jina, free from false beliefs. 

Page #49:
---------------------------
##  Somasen Bhattaraka Composed

**The Kevalis of the Rrorwari sect are not Shruta Kevalis, and the substances are extremely subtle. We do not have the complete means to know them. Our intellect is also very dull. At such a time, considering the command of the omniscient as the proof and determining those profound substances is Agyavichay Dharma Dhyan. || 34 ||**

**Whatever way Jain Dharma flourishes, that is the opinion of Apaya Vichay Dharma Dhyan. || 35 ||**

**The meaning is that beings are trapped in the clutches of false beliefs and are taking many dives in this ocean of existence. And many people, lusting after worldly desires, are misinterpreting beings - they themselves are lagging behind the right path and are also trapping those innocent, simple beings in their web of delusion. When will they attain wisdom? And how will those people who are hanging beings in their arms and throwing them into the burning fire of suffering, how will they deviate from the wrong path? And how will they engage in the right path that gives ultimate peace and happiness? This contemplation is Apaya Vichay Dharma Dhyan. || 35 ||**

**Whatever actions are done by the enemies of karma, good or bad, those fruits are enjoyed by the beings, this contemplation of good and bad fruits is Vipak Vichay Dharma Dhyan. || 36 ||**

**There is suffering in hell, happiness in heaven, and both in the middle world. This world is to be known as three-fold, this is the ultimate Sansthan Vichay Dharma Dhyan. || 37 ||**

**There are three divisions of the world: Adholok, Madhyalok, and Urddhvalok. In Adholok, the hellish beings reside. There, those beings suffer greatly - they do not even have a moment of happiness. In short, they have to endure suffering day and night. In Urddhvalok, the gods reside. There, they have received various kinds of comforts according to their destiny, which they enjoy to their heart's content. The implication is that the lives of those heavenly beings are, in a way, blissful. And in Madhyalok, there is both happiness and suffering. This contemplation of the form of the world is Sansthan Vichay Dharma Dhyan. || 37 ||**

**Types of Shukla Dhyan. Shukla Dhyan is of four types, directly giving the path to liberation. || 38 ||**

**The first is the contemplation called Prithaktvaadi Vitarka. || 38 ||**

**The second is the contemplation called Ekatvaadi Vitarka. || 39 ||**

**The third Shukla is the best, which contemplates subtle actions. || 39 ||**

## Trivarnika Achar: Four Stages of Meditation

**Trivarnika Achar** describes four stages of meditation that lead to liberation (moksha). These stages are:

1. **Pruthaktva Vitarka Vichar:** This stage involves contemplation of different scriptures and their meanings. It is characterized by a constant flow of thoughts and ideas.
2. **Ekatva Vitarka Avichar:** This stage involves a single, unwavering focus on a specific scripture or concept. The mind remains steady and free from distractions.
3. **Sookshma Kriya Pratipati:** This stage involves focusing on subtle actions of the mind, speech, and body. It is achieved by gradually refining these actions until they become extremely subtle. This stage is associated with the 13th Gunasthan (stage of spiritual development) and is practiced by those who are nearing liberation.
4. **Vyuparat Kriya Nivritti:** This stage involves complete cessation of all actions, both physical and mental. It is achieved by a complete detachment from all attachments and desires. This stage is associated with the 14th Gunasthan and is the final stage before liberation.

The meaning of these stages is clear from their names. 

**Note:** The terms "Gunasthan," "Aasrav," and "Avyuparat" are specific to Jainism and refer to stages of spiritual development, karmic attachments, and the state of being free from karmic attachments, respectively. 

Page #51:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Somasen Bhattaraka's Composition**

The duration of this Gunasthan is equal to the time taken to pronounce the five short vowels: a, i, u, ṛ, and ḷ. Here, the subtle body yoga is suppressed, hence they are called Niruddha Yoga. They do not have any inflow of karma, therefore they are called Vigatasrava. At the penultimate stage of this Gunasthan - one stage before the final stage - 72 karmas are destroyed. At that very moment, Samuccinna Kiyavyanam occurs. Subsequently, at the final stage, thirteen prakritis are destroyed, and they attain liberation and reach the abode of the Supreme Soul. || 44 ||

**12**

The four dhyanas, namely Artha, Raudra, Dharma, and Shukla, are to be known in detail from the Agamas. They are the cause of suffering and happiness respectively. || 45 ||

Whatever exists in this world, contemplating it within one's own body is called Pindastha Dhyana. || 46 ||

Dhyana with mantras of one, two, three, four, five, six, eight, sixteen, and thirty-five letters is called Padastha Dhyana. And contemplating the distinction between the body and the soul is called Rupastha Dhyana. Meaning - Contemplating the qualities of the Vibhuti-yukt Arhant Dev is Rupastha Dhyana. || 47-48 ||

Contemplating the formless, perfect Supreme Soul, free from eight karmas and adorned with eight qualities, is called Rupatita Dhyana. Here, only the literal meaning of these four dhyanas has been written. The detailed explanation should be understood from texts like Jnanarnava. || 49 ||

**Morning Rituals**

Upon waking up in the morning, one should focus their mind on the feet of the Jina. Discarding the Raudra Dhyana of the night, one should contemplate the seven tattvas. The Dharma and Shukla Dhyanas, free from the impurities of the Kali Yuga, are pure Samayika. Where am I, my soul, filled with various qualities? From where is my burden of karma? || 50 || 

Page #52:
---------------------------
Trivarnikaachar...
. Upon rising from bed in the morning, one should offer their salutations at the feet of the Jina Dev; abandoning agitated and fierce meditation, one should contemplate the seven elements at all times; contemplate righteous meditation and white meditation, and perform Samayik, which liberates from sins. And one should also contemplate: from where did this soul, a bundle of various qualities, come, and how did this burden of karma, which causes suffering, attach to me. || 50 || ..
In the world, entangled with many sufferings due to evil karma, ... · This being has obtained human birth due to some good karma. It has obtained Jain Dharma with great difficulty. Jain Dharma destroys many sins in an instant, it is the cause of unimaginable happiness. Great yogis contemplate it. It is a treasure trove of excellent qualities. || 51 || • Food, fear, sexual desire, and attachment, these four types of desires torment this being. It does not find even a trace of happiness in the three realms. Thus, upon rising in the morning, one should contemplate... || 52 ||
Suffering from extreme cold and heat, excessive hunger, thirst, etc.,
Cutting, piercing, and crushing with weapons, in a grinding machine.
Pulling out the intestines, beating with maces, and throwing into blazing fire... This is what is heard about the suffering in hell. || 53 ||
Suffering from the sun, cold, and rain in the animal realm, fear in the forest;
Carrying heavy burdens, being beaten, and cut by lions, etc.
Hunger, thirst, etc., being eaten by insects, ants, and flies,
Being controlled by others, facing away, and being forced to work like a donkey, etc. || 54 ||

##  Translation:

**Chapter 54**

Composed by Somasen Bhattaraka

If a being takes birth in the *tiryag-gati* (animal realm) due to *karma-yoga*, it experiences intense suffering from extreme heat, cold, and rain. It is tormented by fear of ferocious animals like lions in the forests. It carries heavy loads on its back, is beaten with wood, whips, and other instruments. Its nose and ears are pierced. It endures intense hunger and thirst. It is constantly bitten by insects, mosquitoes, and flies. It has no freedom and is bound in one place with ropes. In short, the *tiryag-gati* is filled with nothing but suffering; there is no trace of happiness.

**Chapter 55**

Even in the human realm, there is great suffering from the separation of loved ones like wife, children, etc. There are four types of suffering in this realm: mental, physical, natural, and external. One experiences poverty, humiliation, and disgrace, which cause immense pain. There is also suffering from anger, grief, addiction, and other causes like imprisonment and death.

**Chapter 56**

Although there is no physical suffering in the *deva-gati* (heavenly realm), there is immense mental suffering from the separation of loved ones, which destroys the root of happiness. Due to lack of good deeds, many *devas* become vehicles or servants of Indra. Many are far removed from wealth and power. They are envious of the wealth and power of other *devas* and are constantly afraid of death. Thus, there is also much suffering in the *deva-gati*.

**Chapter 57**

This world is a beautifully constructed theater; the Siddha (liberated soul) is the spectator; the living being, with its various bodies, is the dancer; and *karma* is the playwright. Therefore, this being, in this theater, takes on various colors like red, yellow, green, white, and black. It takes on both gross and subtle forms and acts like a skilled dancer, even in the lowest of families. 

Page #54:
---------------------------
## Trivarnika Achar

The soul, adorned in red, yellow, green, white, black, and bodies of various sizes, dances like a skilled actor in high and low families. || 57 ||

Sometimes this human experiences pleasure from embracing beautiful women, sometimes he listens to songs with various melodies, sometimes he watches the dancing of women who are skilled in various forms of entertainment, and becomes entangled in their allure, turning away from Dharma and becoming immersed in worldly desires. This is truly astonishing. || 58 ||

Sometimes beautiful women with lotus-like faces display their charms, sometimes beings suffer in the hells due to the five types of violence against life, sometimes servants stand with fly whisks, sometimes beings become worms in the decaying bodies of the dead due to their own karma. Thus, upon waking from bed in the morning, one should contemplate the state of the world. || 59 ||

**Samayika:**

The five great vows are indeed difficult to uphold in this world. I am unable to even hold them for a moment. How can I cross this ocean of samsara? With such thoughts in mind, upon rising from bed, one should leave the bed, sit in a pure place, wear clean clothes, and perform Samayika in silence. || 60-61 ||

Equality towards all beings, self-control, good intentions, and the abandonment of anger and cruelty - this is considered Samayika. || 62 || 

Page #55:
---------------------------
To cultivate equality towards all beings in the world, to always have good intentions in observing restraint, and to abandon agitated and angry thoughts is Samayika. || 62 ||

One should perform the necessary actions of pure conduct, like a monk, with humility, at the appropriate time, in the appropriate posture, place, mudra, rotation, and bowing of the head. || 63 ||

In life and death, gain and loss, union and separation, friend and foe, pleasure and pain, I always maintain equanimity, without attachment or aversion. || 64 ||

O Jinendra, Lord of the three worlds! I now renounce, with condemnation, the evil deeds generated by this sinful, wicked, dull-witted, deceitful, greedy, and passion-and-aversion-stained mind, and I aspire to remain on the righteous path. || 65 ||

Shravakas should perform the necessary actions diligently and according to the rules; in their absence, they should perform pure japa for the purification of their soul. || 66 ||

Through the grace of the Siddhachakra, mantras become perfected. Therefore, one should worship the mantras in front of the Siddhachakra and then perform their worship. || 67 ||

He who meditates on the divine, with the upward and downward rays, with drops, with the supreme, enveloped in the sound of Brahma, filled with the squares, with the lotus petals facing the directions, with the essence of the union, with the Anahata sound on the inner petals, and enveloped in the sound of Him, is blessed with liberation and a voice that terrifies enemies. || 68 || 

Page #56:
---------------------------
...The Trivarnika Achar: which has a ref above and below, and which is combined with a Hakara including zero, is distinct from the Brahma Swar (Om), on which the tattva aksharas are written in the sandi mag of the lotus leaves, the Anahat mantra is written at the end of each leaf, and which is enveloped by Hriankar; and the Swar, Kavarga, Chavarga, Tavarga, Tanvarga, Pavarga, Yavarga and Shavarga, these eight vargas are written on each leaf of this supreme Deva-Siddha Chakra, the man who meditates on it becomes worthy of the love of liberation and becomes like a lion to subdue the enemy elephant. || 68 || ...
Urddhadho Ref Samyuktam, Saper Bindulanchchitam.
Anahatayutam Tatvam Mantra Raj Prachakshate. || 69 || That Anahat Yuta Hakara, which has a ref above and below, and which is combined with zero, is called Mantra Raj. || 69 ||
Karam Bindusamyuktam Nityam Dhyayanti Yoginah.
Kamadam Mokshadam Chaiva Omkaraya Namo Namah. || 70 || Om Namah. The Muni Gan meditate on the Aankar akshar, which is combined with a bindu, that Om, which is the fulfiller of all desires and the giver of liberation, is saluted. || 70 ||
Avarnaasya Sahasrartha Jappanand Sambhritah.
Pramoti Ekopvaasasya Nirjaraam Nirjitaasravah. || 71 || He who joyfully chants this Om five hundred times, stops the inflow of new karmas and performs the Nirjara of one fast. Meaning: The fruit that is obtained by performing one fast is obtained by chanting this Om five hundred times. || 71 ||
Havarnaantaha Parsva Jino Adho Refastalagatah Sa Dharendra.
Turyaswarah Savinduh Sa Bhavet Padmavati Sanjna. || 72 || The Hakara in this mantra is the indicator of Parsva Jin, the ref below is the indicator of Dharanendra, and the Ikar with a bindu in it is the indicator of Padmavati-Shasan Devi. Meaning: This Hrim mantra is the listener of Parsva Jin, along with Padmavati and Dharanendra. || 72 ||
Tribhuvanajanmohakari Vidyaeyam Pranavapurvanamananta. Om Him Namah. Ekakshariti Sanjna Japatah Phaladaayini Nityam. || 73 || 

Page #57:
---------------------------
**Pranava Om, composed by Somasen Bhattaraka, is a one-syllable mantra that captivates all three realms. It bestows the highest fruits upon those who chant it. The meaning is "Om Namah" - chanting this mantra leads to the attainment of one's desired goal.**

**The syllable "Arham" is the word for Brahman, the Supreme Being. It is the seed of the Siddha Chakra. I bow to it with my mind, speech, and body.**

**The mantra "Arihant" is composed of four syllables and grants the fruits of Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha. If a yogi chants this mantra for four nights, they attain liberation.**

**The mantra "Arihant Sinch" is composed of six syllables, is invincible, and is filled with merit. A meditative person who chants this mantra three hundred times attains liberation.**

**The fourteen-syllable mantra "Shrimavrishbhadivardhamanantabyo Namah" is chanted fourteen thousand times by those who are attached to worldly desires but are free from attachment.**

**The Supreme Being has thirty-five syllables. These are the natural forms of the universe, and no one has ever wasted them. This mantra should be remembered with devotion by those who are free from worldly desires and who are dedicated to Dharma.**

**This invincible mantra destroys all obstacles. It is considered the most auspicious mantra for all auspicious occasions.** 

Page #58:
---------------------------
**Trivarnika Achar.**  "Namo Arihantaanam, Namo Siddhaanam, Namo Airiyaanam, Namo Uvvajjaayaanam, Namo Loe Savvasahuna" This five supreme beings' invocation, a mantra in Prakrit language, consists of thirty-five letters. Chanting it brings about the fulfillment of great tasks. It does not harm anyone. The greatness of this mantra is beyond comprehension. Therefore, with the grace of Veer Bhagwan, while partaking in the Dharma he has shown, one should abandon attachment to worldly matters and remember this great mantra with devotion. This mantra king is called the Aparajit mantra, which destroys all kinds of evils in an instant and is the first auspiciousness in all kinds of auspiciousness. || 78-79-80 ||

Remember the great Vidya born from the mantra words, the daughter of the world.  It is adorned with sixteen letters, formed by the names of the five gurus, and brings good to the world. Its other name is Naga mantra. One should constantly remember such a great Vidya. The meaning is "Arhasindaacharyopaadhyaayasarvsaadhubhyo namah".

This mantra, composed by Somasen Bhattaraka, is a great mantra, a destroyer of all sins.
... Recited one hundred and eight times, it fulfills all desires. || 84 || .. This invincible mantra is called the great mantra. It destroys all sins and by reciting it one hundred and eight times, all kinds of work are accomplished. || 84 ||
Violence, falsehood, stealing, lust, and attachment are the five sins that are extremely painful in the cycle of birth and death. || 85 || There are one hundred and eight divisions of each of these five. For example, violence: there is violence that was done in the past, violence that is being done now, and violence that will be done in the future. Thus, there are three divisions of violence. || 86 || Again, multiplying these three by mind, speech, and body, there are nine divisions. Multiplying these nine by action, causing action, and approval, there are twenty-seven divisions. And multiplying these twenty-seven by the four passions: anger, pride, deceit, and greed, there are one hundred and eight divisions of violence. Similarly, there are one hundred and eight divisions of falsehood, one hundred and eight divisions of stealing, one hundred and eight divisions of lust, and one hundred and eight divisions of attachment. Thus, there are five hundred and forty divisions of the five sins. || 85-86-87-88 ||
... It is said in the Tattvartha that the divisions of the five sins are: beginning, commencement, and initiation, multiplied by mind, speech, and body, there are nine divisions. Multiplying these nine by action, causing action, and approval, there are twenty-seven divisions. And multiplying these twenty-seven by the four passions: anger, pride, deceit, and greed, there are one hundred and eight divisions.

##  MAAAn
**Trivarnika Achar**

Now the places suitable for chanting mantras are being told:

**111.** One should chant mantras in a secluded place for liberation, in a cremation ground for evil deeds, and in a Jinalaya for peace.

**112.** This mantra, as instructed by the Sadguru, is fruitful. Therefore, one should perform Samayik, otherwise, one should chant the Panch Namaskar mantra.

**113.** This Panch Namaskar mantra, which is an embodiment of letters, is a deity that protects us. It attracts heavenly wealth, brings the goddess of liberation under control, destroys calamities in all four realms, destroys sins, prevents evil destinies, and conquers delusion every day. Meaning: By chanting the Panch Namaskar mantra, one attains the above-mentioned fruits. Therefore, one should always chant this mantra after waking up in the morning.

**114.** After waking up from sleep and performing Samayik or chanting this mantra, one should go to the Chaityalaya and see the image of the Jina, who is the giver of all auspiciousness, the destroyer of sins, the cause of great merit, and whose lotus feet are worshipped by gods and demons.

**115.** And one should read this praise: O Lord, for a man who has just woken up from sleep and wants his whole day to pass peacefully, if there is any auspicious thing to be seen in this world, then it is your face, which is the treasure of the auspiciousness of the three worlds. In such a situation, what is the use of seeing other things?

## MAANAMMA

**Verse 116:**

The abode of Sri Lilavatana, composed by Somasen Bhattaraka, is a house of great lineage, a source of joy and fame, a playground for the goddess of speech, a treasure trove of victory and prosperity. It is a dwelling place for all festivals, fulfilling all desires. Blessed is the man who, upon waking in the morning, beholds the two feet of the Jina, radiant like the leaves of the Kalpa tree.

**Verse 117:**

Blessed is the man who, with equanimity, beholds the lotus face of the Jina in the morning, and whose heart is devoted to worship, charity, austerity, and other virtuous acts. He is served by both humans and gods in assemblies. He is also worthy of being served by Somasen Muni.

**Verse 118:**

In this chapter, I have briefly described the morning rituals according to the scriptures. I have heard these practices from the mouth of my Guru. Wise men should perform these rituals upon waking in the morning.

**Commentary:**

The saying from Sri Somdeva's *Nitivakyaamrita* states, "One should rise at Brahma Muhurta (two hours before sunrise) and engage in meditation." This chapter explains this saying, which is entirely in accordance with the Vedic path.

**End of Chapter 1 of the Samayika Adhyaya, composed by Somasen, the head of the Bhaddavara sect, in the *Trivarnaacharanirupanam* of the *Sri Dharmarasika Shakha*.** 

Page #66:
---------------------------
## Chapter Two...

Saluting Shantinath, the Jina, who brings peace to sins, I will now speak of the process of purification rituals for the three varnas. ||1||

A body purified by cleanliness becomes fit for restraint. Without cleanliness, there is no austerity, even for one born in a distinguished lineage. ||2||

Cleansed and well-cultivated land yields good fruits. For when the cause is present, the effect arises in accordance with the cause. ||3||

A seed sown in good, cultivated land yields a thousandfold fruit. But a seed sown in uncultivated land, above, perishes. ||4||

The essence of these two verses is that this body is like land. Just as land that is well-fertilized, ploughed several times, and prepared, yields good crops, so too, a body that is ritually purified becomes fit for restraint, vows, and good conduct. And a body that is not purified never becomes fit for restraint, austerity, etc. Therefore, it is very important to purify the body. ||4||

In this world, the attainment of the state of being free from attachments is said by the wise to be restraint, which exists in a purified body. ||5|| 

Page #67:
---------------------------
7.
According to the teachings of Somasen Bhattaraka, the practice of wearing a *nirmath pada* is called *samyama*. This *samyama* is possible only when the body is purified by *sanskaras*. || 5 ||
The practice of *tapas* is the one that eradicates the root of the tree of sin, dries up the ocean of worldly existence, brings about the happiness of liberation, and is the form of Dharma. || 6 || A person who desires to practice *tapas* should definitely practice that *tapas* which uproots the tree of sin, dries up the ocean of worldly existence, bestows the happiness of liberation, and is the form of Dharma. || 6 ||
All beings in the world desire happiness. There is no being in the world who desires suffering. Therefore, these beings who desire happiness are considered fit for *sanskaras*. || 7 ||
Although the inner purification of humans is achieved through *kalalabdhi*, *karma sthiti kalalabdhi*, *jati smaran*, etc., this primary purification depends on the purification of the body. And the purification of the body depends on external *sanskaras* (purification). || 8 ||
Just as a seed has the power to sprout, but it also requires external factors like rain, fertile soil, wind, and sunlight for its growth, similarly, although beings have the potential to attain *samyaktva*, etc., this potential cannot manifest without external factors. These external factors are many, and one of them is the purification of the body through *sanskaras*. || 9 ||
External purification: Bathing, rinsing the mouth, wearing clean clothes, etc., are considered to be the means of purifying the body. *Sutka* (impurity due to death) and other purifications are also considered to be external purifications. || 10 || 

Page #68:
---------------------------
## 29. 

**Varnikaachar:** Continuously bathing in clean water, performing Achaman (ritual mouth rinsing), and wearing clean washed clothes is the purification of the body. And the purification of sins like Sutak (impurity) etc. is external purification. In essence, bathing, Achaman etc. are the external purification of the body. || 10 ||

... Aachar is the first Dharma, according to the opinion of all Dharmis. ...
It is described in many ways, through differences like Garbhaadhan (conception) etc. || 11 ||

... Having performed Samayik and other auspicious actions according to the aforementioned method,
Householders should contemplate in their minds about their household duties. || 12 ||

They should remember time, body, place, enemy, friend, family, income, expenditure, wealth, livelihood, Dharma, and charity. || 13 ||

Meaning: They should contemplate whether this time is suitable for this particular task or not. Whether I can perform this task with this body or not, etc. They should contemplate these things at that very moment. || 13 ||

And from dawn till dusk,
They should clearly remember in their hearts what needs to be done specifically. || 14 ||

**Bahidishagaman:** ... Leaving the place of Samayik, taking the previous clothes,
Wearing only a dhoti and a dupatta, without all the clothes. || 15 ||

Page #74:
---------------------------
## Trivarnika Achar (Chapter 35)

**45.** Do not take earth from these five places: the courtyard of the house, the temple, the burrows, the burrows of mice, and the earth remaining after defecation.

**46.** Similarly, do not use earth from these five places for purification: the place where excrement is disposed, the roots of trees, the well, the pond, and the tank.

**47.** Do not take earth from the road, the surface of the earth, the cremation ground, dust, earth mixed with insects, embers, bones, and pebbles.

**48.** Take earth from a clean place, the bank of a river, a plowed field, and a mine of alum.

**49.** If the earth mentioned above for all four castes is not available, then the householder can perform purification with whatever earth is available in that country.

**50.** Make several balls of that earth. The first ball should be the size of a bilva fruit, the second half the size of the first, and the third half the size of the second.

**51.** Purify the linga with one ball, the hands with three, both feet with two, the anus with five, the nails with seven, and the entire body with one.

**52.** If the prescribed purification is done, half of it is prescribed for the night, half of that for the sick, and half of that for the journey. 

Page #75:
---------------------------
The rules of purification laid down by Somasen Bhattarak in the day are half of what is required at night. For a sick person, it is half of that, and for a sick person on the road, it is half of that again. || 52 ||

For women, Shudras, the weak, and children who have not yet received the sacred thread, purification of the body is achieved by applying sandalwood paste, etc., as prescribed by the great sages. || 53 ||

Householders should always strive for bodily purity. Bodily purity is the root of all their actions. The actions of a householder who does not maintain bodily purity are mostly fruitless. || 54 ||

After defecation, the purification should be twice as much as after urination, and thrice as much after sexual intercourse. If there is a loss of semen during sleep, one should purify oneself accordingly. || 55 ||

Apply three handfuls of earth on the top and bottom of the feet (on the soles) after defecation, etc. Then wash the hands and feet with one handful of earth each. || 56 ||

Wash the left foot first, then the right foot. Shudras, etc., may do as they please, but even they should wash the left foot first and then the right foot when performing actions without purification. || 57 ||

This is the method of purification. After going some distance and staying in a clean place, wash the feet and then perform mouth cleansing. || 58 ||

**Somasen Bhattaraka's Composition**

**61-62**
After repeatedly throwing the Kurula (toothbrush) away from oneself a few times, so that the spittle does not fall back on oneself, one should perform Achaman (rinsing the mouth) twice, facing east or north. Afterwards, one should clean one's teeth with a suitable Dantoun (toothbrush) with full attention. A person who does not cleanse their mouth in this way and keeps their mouth unclean is considered extremely impure.

**38**
**Suitable Dantoun**

**63-64**
Khadira (Acacia Catechu), Karanj (Pongamia pinnata), Kadamba (Anthocephalus cadamba), Vat (Ficus benghalensis), Imli (Tamarindus indica), Venuvriksh (Bamboo), Neem (Azadirachta indica), Aam (Mangifera indica), Apamarga (Achyranthes aspera), Bilva (Aegle marmelos), Arka (Calotropis gigantea), and Amalaki (Phyllanthus emblica) are all considered suitable for cleaning teeth.

**65**
The Dantoun made from the Kshiravriksha (Milk Tree) should be twelve angulas (finger widths) long and as thick as the little finger.

**66-67**
**Unsuitable Dantoun**

Guvaka (Areca nut), Tal (Palmyra palm), Hintal (Borassus flabellifer), Ketaki (Pandanus odoratissimus), Mahavat (Ficus benghalensis), Kharjuri (Date palm), and Narikel (Coconut) - these seven trees are considered to be Trunraj (grass kings). A person who cleanses their teeth with a Dantoun made from these Trunraj trees is considered cruel and sinful. Because countless living beings reside within these Dantoun, one should abandon their use.

**68-69**
One should not clean their teeth with a wooden Dantoun on the second, fifth, eighth, eleventh, and fourteenth lunar days. One should also avoid using a wooden Dantoun on Sundays, inauspicious days, Sankranti (solar ingress), one's birthday, and during vows like Dasha Lakshana, Ranatraya, and Ashtahnhika.

##  Annaphar by Somasen Bhattarak

**77.**  Achaman should always be performed, even without bathing.  A being who performs Achaman is considered pure by the Jina.

**78.**  The characteristics and mudras of Sandhya and Achaman will be explained later.  Now, the method of bathing will be described.

**79.**  Before bathing, one should have their body massaged with oil by another person.  This ensures the purification of the entire body and promotes its strength.

**80.**  Offer vessels with your own hand, have your body massaged by another person's hand, receive tilak from the Guru's hand, and be served food by your mother.

**81.**  Do not massage with oil on Ashtami, Chaturdashi, Panchami, Sunday, and days of fasts.

**82.**  Bathing with oil massage on Char Lagna, Monday, Thursday, and empty tithis of both fortnights is a cause of illness.

**83.**  A being who bathes on the lunar mansion of Hasta, the star of Rekha, and the lunar mansion of Punarvasu, while observing vows, will not be afflicted by illness.

## The Vernacular (Varnika) 41

One who bathes after oil massage on the Nakshatras of Dhanishta, Revati, Mrig, Ardra, and Punarvasu, and observes the fast, will never be afflicted by diseases.

**Verse 84:**

On Monday, fame spreads; on Wednesday, gold is obtained; on Thursday and Saturday, lifespan increases; on Sunday, the death of a son occurs; on Tuesday, one's own death occurs; and on Friday, wealth is lost by bathing with oil.

**Verse 85:**

In marriage, on the last day of the mourning period, during festivals, and for the sake of friends, one should bathe with oil whenever desired. A menstruating woman should also bathe with oil whenever desired.

**89.** One should not massage with oil mixed with mud, grains, sourness, etc., otherwise it will only lead to impurity.

**90.** **Snānavidhi**... After bathing with warm water, one should bathe on a clean, living-being-free place like a stone. One should bathe with great care so that no harm is caused to living beings.

**91.** One should bathe with water that is neither too little nor too much. It should be lukewarm or mixed with some astringent substance.

**92-93.** Water that has been struck by stones, heated by the sun's rays, churned by the feet of animals, flowed from waterfalls, made prasūka by dust and machinery, and made prasūka by fragrances, etc., is considered prasūka for bathing and purification. This water is not prasūka for drinking.

**94.** One should never bathe in those places that have been declared as pilgrimage sites by ignorant, wrong-view holders, as they are the cause of the destruction of many living beings.

**96.** Oil does not purify without the touch of the five senses. Oil massage is not suitable for Brahmachāris. 

Page #82:

## Trivarnika Achar:

**96.** The bodies of the five-sensed beings, after death, cannot be purified without applying oil, but it is not appropriate for Brahmachari and Yatis to apply oil.

**97.** A householder who bathes in water for seven consecutive days becomes like a Shudra. Therefore, one should bathe every day except on Sunday.

**98.** This body is extremely impure, filled with nine orifices from which foul-smelling excretions, urine, nasal discharge, saliva, phlegm, etc., flow day and night. Therefore, it is advised to purify it by bathing in the morning.

**99.** A man who is unable to bathe in the morning should bathe at noon, using water brought by himself, his wife, his disciples, or his sons.

**100.** One should not bathe with water brought by a Shudra, nor with one hand, nor with unfiltered water, nor with foul-smelling water.

##  Varnika Achar

At dusk, during worship, on the day of Sankranti, on the day of an eclipse, after vomiting, after touching liquor, meat, bones, leather, after sexual intercourse, after defecation, after recovering from illness, after going to a cremation ground, after hearing of someone's death, after having a bad dream, after being touched by a mouse, after being touched by a Chandala, after being touched by excrement, urine, crow, owl, dog, village pig, after the death of a sage, after hearing of the death of a family member, near or far, after contact with leftovers, untouchables, vomit, menstruating women, etc., after being touched by clothes, food, or meals touched by untouchables, and after a plate breaks while eating, one should bathe three times with pure water, reciting the aforementioned mantras and yantras, wash all their clothes, and perform Arsh, Tarpan, mantras, japa, charity, and worship. By doing so, householders achieve external and internal purity. || 107 || 112 ||

Thus, I have spoken of this Varnika Achar, which purifies householders, after examining all the scriptures according to Jainism. Without this Varnika Achar, there is no religion for those who have a body. Now, the mantras related to Varnika Achar, which destroy the cycle of birth and death, are briefly explained. || 113 ||

After examining many scriptures of Jainism, this Varnika Achar, which purifies householders externally, has been stated. Because, without Varnika Achar, there is no other religion for householders in this world. Now, the mantras related to Varnika Achar, which destroy the cycle of birth and death, are briefly explained. || 113 ||

**Om Hee Vee Snaan Sthan Bhu: Shuddhayatu Swaha.**

Recite this mantra and sprinkle the bathing place with pure water.

**Om Ha Hee Hoon Hee Hah A Si Aa U Sa Idam...**

**Samastham Ganga Sinvaadin Nadin Nad Teerth Jalam Bhavatu Swaha.**

Recite this mantra and touch the bathing water with your hand.

**Jhanta Swaravritam Yojya Mandala Dwaya Veshttam. Toye Nyasya Agratarjanya Tena Anusnanam Avahet. || 114 ||**

Write this yantra in the water and recite the mantra. 

Page #85:
---------------------------
Draw a circle and write the two bijaaksharas, Jha and Tha, in the center. Then write the sixteen vowels, starting with A, around the circle. Draw another circle around the vowels. Create this yantra with the tip of your index finger in your bathwater and then bathe in that water. After creating this yantra in the water, chant the following mantra over it: || 114 ||
46
Then, pronounce the bijaaksharas, V, V, and Hamsa.
While showing this fragrant mudra made with bijaaksharas, recite this mantra: Om Amrite Amritodbhave Amritavarshini Amritam Sraavaya Sraavaya Sam Sam Kleem Kleem Bloo Bloo Draam Draam Dree Dree Draavaya Draavaya Ham Jha Iveen Ksheem Ham Sah Asi Aou Sa Sarvamidam Amritam Bhavatu Swaha. By chanting this mantra, make the bathwater amrit. Then, dip yourself in the water three or five times.
1:
Chant this mantra over the water in the kundal: Om Hee Arh Namah Mama Sarvakarmamalam Prakshalaya Prakshalaya Swaha.
Then, rise and perform achaman as before. Chant this mantra three times: Om Hreem Shreem Kleem Aim Arh Asi Aou Sa Jalamarjanam Karomi Swaha. Mama Samastaduritasantapaapano Dosto Swaha. Then, wash your body with your hands and sprinkle yourself with water from a cupped hand three times.
After bathing and performing achaman, offer water to the earth. This is how: 

Page #86:
---------------------------
## Naivarnicaar

After this, bathe again and perform Achaman (ritual mouth rinsing) and then perform Tarpan (offering water to ancestors) at the same place. This is how it is shown.

...

**Om Vhaan Arhadhbhayah Swaha** || 1 || **Om Nahin Siddhebhyah Swaha** || 2 || **Om Hoom Suribhyah Swaha** || 3 || **Om Hau Paathkebhyah Swaha** || 4 || **Om Vhah Sarvasadhubhyah Swaha** || 5 || **Om Haan Jindharmebhyah Swaha** || 6 || **Om Vhaan Jinagamebhyah Swaha** || 7 || **Om Vhaan Jinachaityebhyah Swaha** || 8 || **Om Haan Jinalayebhyah Swaha** || 9 || **Om Vhaan Samyagdarshanebhyah Swaha** || 10 || **Om Haan Samyagjnaanebhyah Swaha** || 11 || **Om Haan Samyakcharitrebhyah Swaha** || 12 || **Om Haan Samyaktapobhyah Swaha** || 13 || **Om Vhaan Asmadgurubhyah Swaha** || 14 || **Om Haan Asmadvidyagurubhyah Swaha** || 15 || 

**Iti Panchdasha Tarpanmantrah. Etais Tarpanam Kuryat.** ||

Then the process of exiting the water will be discussed further.

...

47

...

These are the fifteen Tarpan Mantras, perform Tarpan with these. After this, what actions to perform after exiting the water will be mentioned in the next chapter.

**Shouchcaarvidhi: Shuchitvajanak: Prokto Vidhanaagame, Sadharinanam Gunavataan Yogyo Yuge'smin Kalau. Shri Bhattarak Somaseenamunibhih Stoko'pi Vistaaratah, Prayah Kshatriavaishya Vipramukhakrut Sarvatra Shudro'priyah.** || 115 ||

1

This Shouchcaarvidhi, which purifies the body, is mentioned in the Vidhanaagama. It is suitable for virtuous, vow-observing householders in this Kaliyuga. This method is mentioned very briefly in the scriptures. The same, with some elaboration, is mentioned here by Bhattarak Somaseen. This method is mainly meant to make the three varnas - Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya - happy. It is not easy for Shudras to perform this aforementioned Shouchcaarvidhi. || 115 ||

## Chapter Three:

**Saluting the Victorious One, the Destroyer of All Sins, we shall now discuss the actions to be performed after emerging from water.**

**1.**  Having bowed to the Victorious One, the destroyer of all sins, we shall now discuss the actions to be performed after emerging from water.

**2.**  Upon emerging from water, one should approach the shore of the water body, cleanse oneself and one's clothes, stand on a flat and pure ground, wear clean clothes, perform the ear-cleansing ritual, the cleansing ritual, and the evening ritual. These six highly pure actions will be explained in order.

**3.**  After emerging from water, one should sit in a pure place free of living beings, and with a pure inner self, perform the Arhat bath as described below.

**4.**  Taking water in both hands, one should chant a mantra once and then sprinkle it on one's head, face, arms, heart, and back.

**5.**  One should anoint oneself with the mantra, using the fragrant mudra. With a single-pointed mind, one should chant the five prostrations mantra with devotion and to the best of one's ability.

**6.**  After bathing according to the scriptures, one should rinse one's mouth twice. Then, one should perform pranayama and offer gratitude with a firm resolve. 

Page #88:
---------------------------
• Trivarnikaachar.
::  According to the scriptures, one should bathe and perform two Achmans. Afterwards, one should perform Pranayama and make a Sankalp. After this, one should perform Tarpan. || 6 ||
One should perform Tarpan of all the Devatas like Jaya, etc., with Akshat and water, facing the east, while wearing the Yajnopavit. || 7 ||  The space between the fingertips is called Devatirth. || 7 ||
One should perform Tarpan of the great Rishis like Gautam, etc., with water mixed with barley, facing the north, while wearing the Yajnopavit as a garland around the neck. || 8 || The space between the fingers is called Rishitirth. || 8 ||
One should perform Tarpan of the Pitris like Vrishabha, etc., with sesame seeds, facing the south, while wearing the Yajnopavit on the right hand. || 9 || The space between the thumb and the finger next to it is called Pitritirth. || 9 ||
I perform Tarpan of the Devatas for the purification of the sins committed by me through bodily impurities. || 10 ||
Meaning - Achman, Tarpan, Pranayama, etc., are found in the scriptures for the purification of the body. This does not prove that they are all from Hinduism. If it is assumed that all these things are from Hinduism and not Jainism, then on what basis is this said? If it is said without any scriptural evidence, then it is not a valid argument, but a mere illusion of an argument. Those who consider this subject to be insignificant also say that Puja, Pratishtha, Murtipujan, etc., are from Hinduism. Then, should we accept their words and discard the hundreds of scriptures written by the Rishis on Puja, Pratishtha, Murtipujan, etc.? Well, even if we assume that there is no harm in accepting their words, then we have to say that this verse is contradictory. 

Page #89:
---------------------------
##  Somasen Bhattaraka's Composition

It is not a test to accept what is relevant to one's own opinion and discard the rest. Where is the justice in that? Only that which is certain can be accepted. Those who used to say a few things, now say a few things, so is the previous and present contradictory statement, or the one who wrote or spoke it, a proof? Never. Those who have not seen the scriptures from the Guru's mouth, nor have they contemplated them, nor do they have the competence in that language, whose words make people laugh and express regret for their mistakes, such men should be considered as proof and some truth should be understood in their words, then why not consider the men who roam the streets and shout at will as good and why not understand the essence in their words? Therefore, it must be said that the test in which one has to throw away a precious gem and accept a worthless piece of glass is of no use. If all the subjects that are found in Hinduism are those of the Hindus, then what is there in the Jain's house? There is no subject among the Jains that is not found among the people outside Jainism. Every subject of the Jains will be found in some form or the other in all the sects. Like the caste system, the caste system, bathing, eating, drinking, sleeping, sitting, worshiping, establishing, the system of heaven and hell, the creation of merit and demerit, observing fasts, observing renunciation, pilgrimage, not harming, not lying, not stealing, not consuming intoxicants, praising God, accepting the existence of the soul, staying in the world due to the cause of karma, liberation due to the absence of karma. Then it must be said that there is nothing of the Jains in this. All this has come from outside. Now it is not known what capital remains in the Jain's house. Therefore, one should not have faith in the words of such people. Those who are annoyed by the very name of the rulers and who only raise arbitrary and absurd doubts, they also disregard the demands of the sages. There are many levels of devotees. It is not inappropriate for a devotee of a particular level to do what is appropriate for that level. This ritual of offering water to the ancestors etc. is not outside Jainism. But it is of Jainism. All these subjects are clearly written in detail in the scriptures established by the sages. || 10 ||

Unsanctified, those who are born of water, fathers, gods. For their satisfaction, I offer water. || 11 ||

Meaning - The word 'unsanctified' is used in this verse. From this it is known that those men who do not have the sacred thread ceremony, they usually become 'vyantar' (intermediate beings) after death. And there is also such an aphorism. It is certain from the principles that the abode of the 'vyantar' is on the entire earth of the middle world. There is no place where they do not reside. Their nature is strange. Although they themselves do not eat or drink, yet they perform such actions in the world, from which it is known that they are doing such work. Therefore, ignorant people say that... 

Page #90:
---------------------------
##  The Four Varnas and Their Conduct:

51. We have seen that the gods eat meat and drink cow urine. We have already said that they do not eat or drink themselves. But their nature is such that they enter the bodies of humans and make them perform all kinds of actions, engaging in various kinds of play. If anyone doubts this, they should refer to the Rajavartika text written by Swami Akalankdev. It states that their tendency is primarily for play. Therefore, it is proven that they engage in such play. This is not only known through inference and scriptures, but also through direct observation, as many Vyantaras are seen engaging in such play even today. The countless goats and other animals that are sacrificed to the gods and goddesses are also the result of their past disturbances. And the scriptures also state that those beings who die and become Vyantaras are the ones who often cause disturbances, and they are pacified by making them perform certain actions. All this is described in the Mahapurana and other scriptures as disturbances caused by Vyantara gods. It is also mentioned that such actions pacify the disturbance. For example, the story of Holika is well-known. In short, Vyantaras have various natures. Some have the nature of consuming water, while others have the nature of taking water squeezed from clothes. These are all their natural actions. Even today, these gods are seen doing this. This clearly shows that Vyantaras reside everywhere and engage in various kinds of play. Therefore, it is completely inappropriate to write that according to Jain principles, neither the gods nor the Pitrigans wander in search of water or suffer, nor do they desire the water of Tarpan or feel satisfied and content upon receiving it. Jain scriptures clearly state that Vyantaras have such a nature and they do this for play - they are pacified by making them perform such actions. Even those things that are clearly found in Jain scriptures are poured with water. Although they do not drink water squeezed from clothes, their nature is such that they make others do it and are pleased by it. Therefore, anything else written on this subject is also nonsensical. When the author is convinced, let them come to the authors and show them their duty. The author has been forced to write this due to lack of faith in Jain scriptures or lack of complete knowledge of them, or due to a desire for reputation by misleading innocent people. Such writing only reveals that what is not before the author's eyes does not exist and such actions never took place. Now the question is, should the Shravakas do this? The answer is that Shravakas have many levels, although they are counted numerically, there are still many subtle nuances within them, just as there are many nuances of Mithyatva karma. Some have one kind of Mithyatva, while others have another - they are not all the same, but it is still Mithyatva. Similarly, there are some aspects of Shravakas who do this at their level, and they can do it at that level. Doing so does not destroy their Samyaktva. Water is not given to Vyantaras for any purpose. Because the verse itself clearly states that those who have died without any rituals, who have become Vyantaras after death, and who want to take water from my hand...

If you keep them, I give them to you easily. There is no purpose of any subject here. Nor does giving water for the fulfillment of their desires lead to false vision. Because hating true gods, gurus, scriptures and being attracted to false gods, false gurus, false scriptures is called false vision. The word "dev" here means "apt". The word "kudev" does not refer to the gods related to the path of gods. We will write about this subject in another chapter. The summary is that the Vyantar gods expect water and they are also satisfied. || 11 ||

##  Throwing water with hands, outside the water on the shore. After lifting, squeeze the cloth with a mantra towards the south. || 12 ||

After reading the above verse, take water in your hand, on the shore of that reservoir, outside the water, leave the offering of water. After that, take off the clothes and squeeze them towards the south with a mantra. || 12 ||

##  Some men born in our lineage, become Vyantar or Asura gods after death. Let them receive the water squeezed from the cloth given by me. || 13 ||

Leaving the Darbha grass on the shore, wear the Yajnopavita like a garland around the neck and perform Achaman twice. With the mantra "Shuchiv", sprinkle the dry cloth that is kept for wearing. That is, purify it by sprinkling water on it. Then, wear the clothes after reciting the mantra of the Yugmavasra. And before wearing the clothes, wipe your body or head. || 14 || 15 ||

##  Therefore, do not wipe the body with a cloth or hand after wearing clothes. Because wiping the body later becomes equal to being licked by a dog. And then it becomes pure by bathing. This is also the nature of a thing, there is no point in arguing why it happens. Why does it not work in the nature of things? If someone says why fire is hot, then you have to say that it is its nature. || 16 ||

## Trivarnika Achar [

**17.** There are three and a half crore (35 million) hairs on a human body. And as many hairs as there are on the body, so many sacred places are there in the body. Therefore, one should not defile the body by wiping it.

**18.** The gods drink the water that drips from the head, the ancestors drink the water that drips from the mouth, the Yakshas and Gandharvas drink the water that drips from the middle, and all living beings drink the water that drips from the lower part.

**Meaning:** Before putting on clothes after bathing, one should wipe the limbs and organs of the body. After putting on clothes, one should not wipe the body with anything. Because the water that remains on the body after wearing a dhoti becomes impure in the aforementioned way. Therefore, wiping the body with it will surely make it as impure as a dog licking it.

Although the gods have mental food, the ancestors have reached many liberated places, so it seems impossible for them to drink this water. Similarly, it is impossible for Yakshas, Gandharvas, and all living beings to drink the water of the body, but still, there must be some meaning hidden in what is written. Although we do not have any sufficient means of knowing these things at this time, because there is a lack of preaching on this subject at this time, this subject is not irrelevant. If we were to consider every subject irrelevant simply because we do not know it, then no matter would be true. If we knew everything, then there would be no need for an omniscient being. There are many subjects that we do not know, but they can be found in other scriptures. And there are some that cannot be found. The sages could not write down everything they remembered in their lifetime. Therefore, the answers to many subjects are not found in the scriptures either. It is not appropriate to call something irrelevant just because we cannot find its answer and it is beyond our understanding. Although the subject of this verse seems impossible, it is still found. Therefore, it must have some meaning. Even useless things become meaningful by conveying their meaning in some way. If someone says that such things should be considered false, what harm will it do to the ultimate truth? The answer to this is that if the subject of the scriptures is considered irrelevant in this way, then every human being will immediately consider anything that is harmful to him irrelevant, and then there will be no authority of the scriptures. Irrelevant subjects are those that contradict the previous and subsequent verses, that hinder the ultimate truth, that are completely nonsensical, that hinder the path to liberation, that lead to the wrong path, and that harm living beings. But there are no such things in these verses that can be considered unproven.

"There is no action that is universally trustworthy." 

Page #93:

##  Translation:

**Chapter 18**

**Somasenadwarakavirachit**

**Meaning:** If disbelief is entertained in all matters, then no action will be possible. According to this principle, if topics like those which many people consider to be absurd, are declared absurd by others through their own baseless arguments, then gradually, disbelief will prevail everywhere, and no action will be performed properly. The consequence of this will be that people will indulge in arbitrary actions and will be inclined towards the wrong path. It is better to avoid violating the norms of the scriptures and to discard the belief that the people of the past have incorporated these topics into Hinduism.

**Chapter 19**

**Surapanasam toyam prshthatah keshavindavah |
Dakshine janhavi toyam vame tu rudhiram bhavet || 19 ||**

Water clinging to the hair that drips down the back is considered equivalent to drinking alcohol. The water that drips to the right is considered equivalent to Ganga water, and the water that drips to the left is considered equivalent to blood.

**Meaning:** Some might argue that since the water from the hair is considered holy, how can it be compared to alcohol and blood? The answer is that just as someone might say that every part of a Guru is worthy of worship, someone else might argue whether their anus and genitals are also worthy of worship. The same logic applies to this argument. It does not mean that by comparing it to alcohol and blood, it actually becomes alcohol or blood. Just as someone might say that this food tastes like meat, it does not mean that it is actually the flesh of a dead animal. It is called meat-like because it evokes the idea of meat. Therefore, whatever similarity a thing acquires, it becomes worthy or unworthy accordingly.

The essence of these verses is that due to these reasons, this water becomes like this and that, therefore, one should not wipe the body with it. It is appropriate to wipe it off thoroughly before wearing clothes. This is further explained in the following verse.

**Chapter 20**

**Snanaṁ kṛtvā dhṛte vastre patanti keshavindavah |
Tatlanaṁ niṣphalaṁ vidyāt punaḥ snānena śuddhati || 20 ||**

The water that remains entangled in the hair after bathing and wearing clothes, the drops that fall from it, render the bath useless. That person becomes pure by bathing again.

**Chapter 21**

**Apāvṛtrapaṭo namo namathādhipaḥ mā ..................... . . .
Namaśca malino dāsī namaḥ kaupīnavān api || 21 ||
Upaṭo nagno nagnaścādhapaḥ smṛtaḥ. ...................**

.: The code of conduct for the three orders.
One who wears a torn garment, one who wears a half garment, one who wears a dirty garment, one who wears a loincloth, one who wears saffron robes, one who wears only a dhoti and no other garment like a shawl, one who wears a loincloth only on the inside, one who wears a loincloth on the outside, and one who wears no clothes at all - these ten men are considered naked. || 21 || 22 ||
It is known that these ten are naked. A garment that is two or four angulas wide, saffron colored, smoky colored, made of wool, adorned with wool or other hair, with torn corners, and completely worn out - such garments should not be worn by the three orders of Jain lay followers. || 23 || 24 ||
Garments that have been burnt by fire, worn out, soiled, gnawed by mice, and eaten by cows, buffaloes, etc., should be completely abandoned by the three orders of Jain lay followers; they should never be worn. || 25 ||
Garments that are dyed blue or red should be abandoned by the three orders of Jain lay followers. If blue or red is mixed with other substances or colors, it is not considered impure for women. And it is not a fault for them to wear this color garment while sleeping. || 26 ||
By protecting such garments, selling them, and making a living by trading in them, one becomes impure. He becomes pure and clean after one and a half months after giving up this business. || 27 ||

Somasen Bhattaraka Composed-
When one wears a blue or red cloth on their body, they will surely reside in Yama's city, having become a worm in the bodies of living beings. || 28 ||
Meaning- They will become a worm in the bodies of living beings after death. There are many types of descriptions, some are repulsive, which make living beings disgusted by foreign substances. Some are terrifying. Here, this description seems terrifying. This shows the fear of not wearing blue or red clothes. The essence of this is that such clothes are harmful, therefore, one should not wear such clothes. || 28 ||
In silk cloth and pattu sutra, there is no harm in blue. Women should always avoid wearing clothes and should also avoid wearing other people's clothes. || 29 ||
It is said- Eating another's food, wearing another's clothes, sleeping on another's bed, having intercourse with another's wife, and living in another's house, even Indra's glory is destroyed. || 30 ||
What more can be said, eating another's food, wearing another's clothes, sleeping on another's bed, having intercourse with another's wife, and living in another's house, even Indra's glory is destroyed, that is, by doing these things, even Indra, who is very powerful, loses his glory, let alone others. || 30 ||
Unwashed, washed by a Shudra, or washed the previous day, these three types of clothes are not fit to be worn. Therefore, do not perform any actions while wearing such clothes. || 31 ||
Clothes washed by a woman, washed by a Shudra, washed by servants, washed by ignorant children, are said to be unwashed. || 32 ||

A Shravaka should never wring out clothes in water. Nor should he place dry clothes on a cot. || 33 ||

A Shravaka should place the clothes on dry wood and purify them by performing Achaman twice. He should spread the washed clothes in a clean place where feet do not touch or in a high place. || 34 ||

A Shravaka should not wring out clothes on the ninth day, the full moon day, the Sankranti day, and the Shraddha day. Nor should he put clothes in alkali on these days. || 35 ||

After bathing, a householder should not remove wet clothes from his head. He should remove them from below, otherwise, he must bathe again to purify himself. || 36 ||

A Shravaka should not remove wet clothes towards the west or south, otherwise, he must bathe again. He should not eat or perform deity worship wearing only one garment. He should not perform Pitru karma, charity, Homa, Japa, etc. He should not perform any action wearing torn clothes, half-clothed, or with half a garment tied on his head. || 37 || 38 ||

As stated by Somasen Bhattaraka:
"Snanam, danam, japam, homam, svadhyay, pitrtarpana...
Naikavastro grihi kuryachchaddhabhojanasakriyam." || 39 ||
Trivarnika Shravakgana should not perform activities like bathing, charity, chanting, fire rituals, self-study, offering libations to ancestors, shraddha, and meals while wearing only one garment (dhoti). These activities should be performed while wearing a dhoti and a dupatta. || 39 ||
"Daryamuttarayamadau tato'ntariyak tatha...
Chatushkonam bhavedvstram antarayam cha nirmalam." || 40 ||
First, one should wear a dupatta, followed by a dhoti. Both garments should have four equal corners, without any tears, and should be clean. || 40 ||
"Trihastam tu vishalam syavyayatam panchahastakam...
Adhovstram tu hastashtan dwihast-vistaranmatam." || 41 ||
A dupatta that is three cubits wide would be too large, therefore, it should be two cubits wide and five cubits long. The dhoti should be eight cubits long and two cubits wide. || 41 ||
"Pattakulam tatha soutram shubham va pitameva cha...
Kadachidraktavstram svaccheshavstram tu varjayet." || 42 ||
The garments should be made of silk or cotton, and should be white or yellow in color. Red is also acceptable. Other colors should be avoided for the aforementioned activities. || 42 ||
"Romajacharmajam vastram duratah parivarjayet.
Natisthulanaatisukshma vikarparicharjatam." || 43 ||
Garments made of wool or leather should be completely avoided. The garments should not be too thick or too thin, and should not cause any discomfort. || 43 ||
"Lambayitva pura konadvayam tenaiva vasasa...
Aveshtayetkati desham vamen pachabandhanam." || 44 ||
After lengthening the garment, tie the two corners around the waist with a left-handed knot. || 44 ||
"Konadvayam tatah paschat samichinam prakacchayet.
Katimekhali kamantdeshe gopyam prabandhayet." || 45 ||
Then, tie the two corners securely at the waist with a belt, keeping it hidden. || 45 ||

When one starts wearing a dhoti, it should be kept slightly longer on one side and more on the other. Wrap it around the waist. First, bring the left arm's angle (armpit) to the right side, then bring the right side to the left arm. Then tuck the smaller angles down from the bottom. The larger angle in the back should be wrapped around the waist like a belt and tucked in from the inside. || 44 || 45 ||:

**5.** One should squeeze wet clothes with the left hand, and squeeze them with one's own hand or with the hand of a fellow Jain. The clothes should be squeezed with such care that no harm is caused to other living beings.

**51.** Types of Bathing: Mantra bath, Earth bath, Fire bath, Air bath, Divine bath, Water bath, and Mind bath are the seven types of baths.

**52.** If one is unable to bathe in the morning, then one should wipe the entire body from head to toe with a wet cloth. Such a person is considered to have bathed.

**53.** Water is naturally pure. If it is heated, it becomes even purer. Therefore, virtuous people consider bathing with warm water to be good.

**54.** One should not bathe with cold water after an oil massage, during a auspicious occasion, or even at home. One should also not apply tilak without bathing.

**55.** One should not bathe in a mixture of hot and cold water. The Jain scriptures prescribe atonement for those who bathe in such mixed water.

Touch the thumb with the index finger, the palm with the chest, the front of the hand with both arms, and the entire hand with the head. ||65|| 66|| 67||..
There are twelve parts of the body for Achaman, and fifteen types of actions. ||68|| ... Both arms, both nostrils, both eyes, both ears, mouth, head, navel, and chest, these twelve parts are mentioned in the Jinaagama. ||69||
Sweat is produced in these parts due to exertion, during defecation, urination, sexual intercourse, eating, sleeping, waking up, walking, etc. ||70||
Sweat and other impurities come out from the ears, eyes, mouth, nose, armpits, groin, and navel, therefore Achaman is performed repeatedly. ||71||
After performing Achaman, wear the Damki mudra on the ring finger, and hold the tip of the nose with the ring finger and thumb according to the rules. ||72||
Kumbhaka, Puraka, and Rechaka are performed. All the sins residing within are destroyed by Rechaka. ||73||

## Translation:

**Somasen Bhattaraka's Composition**

If *kusha* (darbha grass) is not available, then perform all actions with *kansha* (a type of grass). Because *kansha* is equal to *kusha*. If *kansha* is also not available, then use other types of *darbha* as mentioned. (185)

*Kusha* should be used in all religious ceremonies. Fresh *durva* (a type of grass) should be used in all auspicious ceremonies. (86)

**Forbidden *Darbha***

Do not use *darbha* that has a damaged inner part, is broken by nails, is mashed, or is burnt. (87)

Do not pluck *kusha* or break wood like *pipal* on *amavasya* (new moon day) or on the eighth, fourteenth, and fifth days of the lunar month, or on religious festivals. (88)

**Meaning:** Do not pluck *darbha* or break wood for fire on any day except the 15th or 14th day of the *Savana* month. (88)

**Collecting *Samidha*, Flowers, and *Kusha***

A learned person should collect *samidha* (firewood), flowers, and *kusha* themselves. One who performs rituals using *kusha* etc. brought by a *shudra* (member of the lowest caste) or bought with money will fall to a low position. (89)

**Characteristics of *Pavitrak***

A *pavitrak* (sacred thread) for a Brahmin is made of four *darbha* strands, for a Kshatriya of three, and for a Vaishya of two. A group of *darbha* strands is called a *pavitrak*. (90)

**Verse 97:**
One should not perform the act of purification (achaman), worship of the Jina, etc., without a darbha (sacred grass). During the worship of the Jina, chanting, and homa (fire ritual), a Brahma knot should be tied in the pavitra (sacred thread).

**Verse 98:**
One should perform the achaman holding a pavitra with darbha in hand. By performing achaman in this way, the pavitra does not become ucchishta (impure). However, after eating, it becomes ucchishta, so it should be discarded.

**Verse 99:**
Types of pavitra: Darbha, lead, copper, silver, and gold. One should wear a pavitra made of one of these materials on the right hand. The pavitra made of darbha is considered superior to lead, lead to copper, copper to silver, and silver to gold.

**Verse 100:**
A person who wears a gold ring on the ring finger, a silver ring on the index finger, and a copper ring on the little finger is considered pure.

**Verse 101:**
Shravakas (lay followers) should wear gold earrings in both ears, gold bangles on both hands, and silver sandals on their feet. They should also have a shawl (uttarīya) and a clean cloth (yogapatta) with them.

##  The Method of Japa, Composed by Somasenamarka

**With a mind focused on the middle, still and unwavering, one should mark oneself with the Jnana Mudra and hold the left hand straight near the navel.**  **Holding the pure Japa Mala with the thumb and index finger of the right hand, the wise one should perform Japa.**  (111, 112)

**One should recite the Panchanamaskara mantra as per one's convenience, either one hundred and eight, fifty-four, or eighteen times.** **Recite two, two, and one word, taking a pause after each.** **Inhale seven times, reciting four Japa with each breath, completing one hundred and eight Japa in twenty-seven breaths.** **By performing Japa of the Panchanamaskara mantra in this manner, all sins are destroyed.** (113, 114)

**The Upanshu, which is the Chachika, and the Manas are the three types of Japa Mala.** **Among these three, the Upanshu is superior to the Vaachika, and the Manas is superior to the Upanshu.** (115)

**Japa performed with clear words, uttered in a low and high voice, is known as Vaachika Japa.** (116)

**In some books, the verse "Maap Dwaivam Tav Nuti" etc. from the Ekibhava Stotra is found.** 

Page #112:
---------------------------
• **Trivarnikaachar...**
Reciting a mantra composed of short, long, and pluta syllables clearly with water is called **vaachik jap** (verbal japa). || 116 ||
Reciting a mantra very slowly, moving the lips gently, and in such a way that others cannot hear it, is called **upaanshu jap** (sub-verbal japa). || 117 ||
Holding the syllables and words of the mantra in the heart, in the same order as they are in the mantra, and repeatedly contemplating their meaning is called **manas jap** (mental japa). || 118 ||
For those who desire siddhis (spiritual powers), **manas jap** is considered auspicious; for those who desire children, **upaanshu jap** is considered auspicious; and for those who desire wealth, **vaachik jap** is considered auspicious. || 119 ||
One **vaachik jap** is equal to one, one **upaanshu jap** is equal to one hundred, and one **manas jap** is equal to one thousand. This is the opinion of great sages like Jinseenadi. || 120 ||
A **brahmachaari** (celibate) and a **grihastha** (householder) should perform one hundred and eight **japas**. A **vanaprastha** (forest dweller) and a **bhikshu** (mendicant) should perform more than one thousand **japas**. || 121 ||
In the absence of a teacher, one should perform one hundred and eight **japas** in one's own house, and half that number elsewhere. During puja (worship), one should perform ten **japas**, as much as one can. || 122 || 

Page #113:
---------------------------
##  **Translation:**

**Somasen Bhattaraka Composed**

**Chapter 122**

In the days of the **Anudhyaya**, one should recite one hundred and eight **Japas** (repetitions of a mantra), and on other days, half of that, twenty-four, and during the time of worship, ten **Japas**, according to one's strength.

**Chapter 123 & 124**

**Place for Reciting Japas**

The fruit of reciting **Japas** at home is said to be one hundred times greater when done in a forest. In a **punyaram** (sacred garden) or a jungle, it is considered to be a thousand times greater. On a mountain peak, it is ten thousand times greater, on the bank of a river, one lakh (one hundred thousand) times greater, in a temple, one crore (ten million) times greater, and in the presence of the **Jinas**, it is infinite times greater.

**Chapter 125**

**When to Stop Reciting Japas**

One should stop reciting **Japas** upon seeing a person who has broken a vow, a **Chandala** (outcaste), or someone similar, upon hearing their speech, upon feeling a shiver, upon the expulsion of **apana vayu** (downward-moving air), and upon yawning.

**Chapter 126**

**What to Do When Interrupted**

If any of the above hindrances arise while reciting **Japas**, one should perform **achamana** (ritual mouth rinsing), **sadanga pranayama** (six-limbed breathing exercise), or stand up and see the **Jina** (Tirthankara). After that, one should complete the remaining **Japas**.

**Chapter 127 & 128**

**After Reciting Japas**

Having performed the **Japa** ritual as described above, one should stand up from the seat with devotion, join both hands in a **mukuli** (bud-like) position, face the east, and perform the **vandana** (salutation) ritual without any laziness. Then, one should sit down again to perform the remaining rituals.

## 76
**Somasen Bhattaraka Composed**

**Midday Sandhya is fruitful when performed at midday. An action performed out of time bears little or no fruit.** || 136 ||

**AM**
**Monday**

Complete the Sandhya related to the morning before sunrise. Perform the Sandhya related to the evening before the stars are visible. Similarly, perform the Sandhya related to the two Prahars at the time of the two Prahars. An action performed at its proper time is the one that yields the best results. And that which is not performed at its proper time bears very little fruit or no fruit at all. || 135 || 136 ||

If two Ghatiks of time pass, there is no fault. But in this matter, there are criticisms from people. || 137 ||

The best Sandhya is the one performed before the stars disappear, the middle one is the one performed after the stars disappear, and the worst one is the one performed with the sun. The morning Sandhya is considered to be of three types. || 138 ||

The junction of day and night, devoid of the sun and stars, is called Sandhya by the wise sages who see the truth. || 139 ||

The best Sandhya should be performed in the third or fifth part of the day. Performing the midday Sandhya at this time is the best. Performing the midday Sandhya at any other time should be considered fruitless, as before. || 140 ||

## Trivarnika Achar!

**Verse 141:**
If one does not perform Sandhya at the prescribed times, even while living, they are equal to a Shudra, and after death, they are born as a dog. 

**Meaning:** This is a terrifying statement. Its essence is that Trivarnikas should perform Sandhya in the morning, evening, and midday. Without Sandhya, their life in this world and the next is futile. The author's intention is to guide these beings towards the right path, hence the fear they instill. It's not just fear, but the consequences are also dire.

**Verse 142:**
If, due to some reason, the time for Sandhya has passed, then one should bathe and perform Achaman according to the rules, recite 108 Japas, and then begin Sandhya.

**Verse 143:**
In times of national crisis, royal unrest, illness, or during a Sutak (birth or death related ritual impurity), there is no fault in discontinuing Sandhya Vandana.

**Verse 144:**
If a great and auspicious task arises due to Devas, Dwijas, Agni, or Vidya, and Sandhya cannot be performed, there is no harm. Because other virtuous deeds are being performed at that time.

**Offering Mantra:**
Om Hrim Kshvi Upaveshanabhu: Shuddhayatu Swaha. 
Cleanse the place of sitting with Darbha (sacred grass) etc., while reciting this mantra.

After this, perform the Tarpana of the ancestors and fathers with sesame seeds and water.

* **"Om Him Aham Asi A U Sa Om Kraum Namah."** (Om Him Aham, You are that, Om Kraum, I bow.)

This is the mantra for bowing to them.

**Daily Practices:**

After this, perform the Tarpana of the deities with akshata (unbroken rice) and water. This is how the Tarpana of the deities is performed.

This is the order of the Sandhya Vandana in the morning. Similarly, perform the bath and Tarpana in the afternoon and evening, as well as all other rituals like Achamana (rinsing the mouth). Perform all the necessary duties like pouring water on the head, offering water, offering Arghya (water offering), chanting, and worshipping the deities. 

Page #123:
---------------------------
Thus, by means of skillful arrangement and proper procedure, the complete Sandhyopasana ritual is performed. Those noble souls who perform it are rare, for they are free from the fear of worldly existence. This Sandhyopasana is like a ship for the noble beings, rescuing them from the ocean of worldly existence and leading them to the place of liberation. Therefore, wise people should perform Sandhyavandan with respect every day, at all three times. || 149 ||

Sri Brahmasuri, a jewel of the lineage of the twice-born, a master of the Jain path, has written a treatise called "Trivarnikaachar". Seeing this, I, the Muni Somaseen, have also composed this treatise on Trivarnikaachar, with some special features. Let noble souls read and teach it well. || 150 ||

Thus ends the third chapter of the "Sri Dharmarsik Shastra", which describes the Trivarnikaachar, composed by Bhattarak Sri Somaseen, entitled "Snanavastraachamanasanadhyatarpanavarnano".

## Chapter Four

The one who is proficient in traversing the three realms, whose grace enables the pursuit of Dharma, Artha, and Kama, and who resides in this world, is Saraswati, may she dwell in my heart-lotus. ||1||

Saluting the Supreme Lord Shantinath, the bestower of peace, the speaker of the true essence, I shall now speak of the householder's Dharma, which leads to heavenly bliss and abundant enjoyments. ||2||

Having performed the actions described in the third chapter, with joy, one should rise from the water body and, inspecting the ground four steps ahead, proceed towards one's home. On the way, one should not touch those who are not bathed, even if they are of the highest caste, nor should one touch those who are bathed but are Shudras, nor those who are pure but still prone to carelessness. These individuals who should not be touched are described in the following verses. ||3||

One should not touch a Shudra who sells liquor, a potter, a drunkard, a barber, a stone-breaker, a gardener, a weaver, a garland-maker, a violent person, a Mudgala, etc., nor should one touch leftover food, leaves, skin, bones, fallen horns, or nails. ||4, 5||

## Entering the Chaityaalaya

Going there, slowly standing in the outer area of the Jinagaram, washing and purifying the feet, one should perform the Iryapatha in order. || 30 ||

Having left the house of the Jinenadra, one should enter inside, removing the face-cloth and look at the face of the Jina. || 31 ||

One who has bathed in the water reservoir should go to the Chaityaalaya built in his house, stand in the outer courtyard, wash his feet, and then, after purifying them, perform the Iryapatha, circumambulating the Chaityaalaya three times. Then, entering the temple, he should remove the curtain in front of the image and look at the lotus-face of the Sri Jinadeva. In this way, he should recite the following praise. || 30 || 31 ||

## The Jina Darshan Stotra

The darshan of the Jina, the Lord, is auspicious, a remover of all sins, a treasure of virtues. || 32 ||

The great saints consider it to be the means of attaining heaven and liberation. What else is there beyond this? || 32 ||

The darshan of the Jinaraja is like the sun, illuminating the lotus of the heart, a destroyer of the darkness of evil deeds, auspicious, and a constant absorber of the water of obstacles. || 33 ||

The darshan of the Jina, the Lord of the night, is considered to be the supreme pacifier of the burning of birth, a shower of pure nectar of merit, and an enhancer of the ocean of happiness of the virtuous. || 34 ||

The darshan of the Jina, the Kalpavriksha, should be filled with the mind, like a wish-fulfilling tree. || 35 ||

It is a destroyer of the suffering of all beings, like a flower blooming on the earth. || 35 || 

Page #130:
---------------------------
## Chaitraṇikācāra.

This Chaitraṇikācāra destroys the afflictions of all beings in the world and makes the entire world successful with good fruits. || 35 ||

The vision of the Jina is like a wish-fulfilling cow, which grants all desired objects by its grace. It is said that even when a person desires wealth and milks this wish-fulfilling cow, the pure mind is the cause, meaning their desire for wealth is extinguished. || 36 ||

O Jina, who is like a wish-fulfilling cow! Your vision is supremely powerful, granting all kinds of desired objects by its grace. This vision, like a wish-fulfilling cow, is such that when a worthy person milks it with the desire for material wealth, the pure mind is the cause, meaning their desire for material wealth is extinguished. || 36 ||

The vision of the Jina is like a vast ocean of milk, bestowing a multitude of happiness-pearls. It is a supreme cloud, filled with good qualities, and a vast stream of knowledge. || 37 ||

O Jina Ocean! Your vision bestows a multitude of happiness-pearls and is a supreme cloud filled with good qualities, a vast stream of knowledge. || 37 ||

"My two eyes have become successful today by seeing your lotus feet, O Lord. Today, this ocean of the world appears to me like a spoonful of water, O Jewel of the Three Worlds." || 38 ||

O Lord! My two eyes have become successful today by seeing your lotus feet. O Jewel of the Three Worlds! This ocean of the world appears to me like a spoonful of water today. || 38 ||

My mind, yearning to see you, has sprouted many new buds. Approaching you, it has blossomed with dense clusters of flowers. Now, my eyes have reached the auspicious tree of your face, and it is laden with fruits. || 39 ||

##  Translation:

**Verse 40:**

O Lord! When the darkness is destroyed by the brilliance of the moon of your face, what use is there for the moon at night or the powerful sun during the day? What praise can be offered to them?

**Verse 41:**

O God! If anyone desires to know the number of your infinite virtues, let him first try to measure the vastness of the sky with his fingers. Let him continuously practice counting the sky's dimensions. 

**Meaning:** Just as the sky cannot be measured with fingers, your virtues cannot be counted.

**Verse 42:**

O Lord! The fortunate man who constantly gazes at your feet, which are like a divine mirror reflecting the brilliance of your nails, what auspicious blessings remain unattainable for him, who is blessed with the union of wealth, fame, and fortitude?

**Meaning:** By your auspicious sight, all blessings are attainable.

**Verse 43:**

O God! If I am blessed with your sight every day, which bestows auspicious fruits and keeps me always joyful, then I have no need for external things like the wish-fulfilling tree, the ocean, gods, planets, mantras, the wish-granting gem, etc.

**Meaning:** There is nothing in the world greater than your sight. I only desire to see you always. I have no need for mantras, tantras, etc.

**Verse 44:**

Having thus praised the Lord and sitting before the Jina, he requested water, rice, and sandalwood for his wife.

**111**
The Bhattaraka Somasen has written: A triangular kund should be made on the south side and a circular kund on the north side. Three mekhala should be made around these kunds, as before.

**112**
The first mekhala should be five matra high, the second four matra high, and the third three matra high. The distance between these three kunds should be one matra.

**113**
Eight dikpal pitha should be made around the vedika of the kunds, in all eight directions. Then, after purifying everything with water, etc., worship should be performed.

**114**
Then, a square kund should be made, followed by a triangular kund, and then a circular kund. These should be purified with water, etc.

**115**
During the nirvanotsava of the Tirthankara, Ganadhara, and Kevali, they attain purity by being worshipped.

**116**
These three types of agni should be established in these three kunds, following the tradition of the Garhapatya, Ahavaniya, and Dakshinagni.

**Explanation:**

There is a doubt that arises: How can agni be considered worthy of worship and pure? If agni is considered pure and worthy of worship, then why do Jains refute the worship of what others consider to be a deity and pure?

The answer is that the object is the same, but the meaning is different. Others consider all types of agni to be pure, worthy of worship, and divine. We do not believe that. However, the agni in which the Tirthankara, Ganadhara, and Kevali are established is considered pure and worthy of worship.

Just as all the stones of the whole world are not venerable, nor is all water venerable, but the inert stone or installation in which the Supreme Being is imagined is venerable. Or the gandhodak which Jain people apply to their foreheads reciting the shloka 'Nirmalam Nirmalikaram' etc., is considered venerable and sacred, not all the stones, flowers and waters of the whole world. When we consider the stones and flowers in which we have imagined the Supreme Being to be sacred and venerable, and apply the bath water of that stone statue to our foreheads with great enthusiasm, then we cannot say that there is any fault in considering the fire in which the body of the Tirthankara etc. was cremated to be sacred and venerable by installing it in this fire. Or it should be understood that all this worship is done in many ways. All of it is the worship of the Atma Deva. || 114 || 116 ||

Four pillars should be erected at the four corners, adorned with lucky leaves and banana stems. Decorate them with bells, torans, garlands of flowers, garlands of pearls etc. Spread a canopy over them, keep auspicious grains like yavar, til, cumin, wheat etc. on them. Keep auspicious things like chamar, mirror, dhoop ghat, jhanjh, dhuja, kalash there. || 117 || 118 ||

Going to the homagriha thus, facing west, sit down and perform the rituals, starting with salutations. || 119 ||

Going to the homagriha prepared in the above manner, facing west, start the worship with salutations. || 119 ||

First of all, worship the Vayu, Medha, Agni, Vastu, Nagas, Kshetrapal, Guru, Pitris, and other Devas according to the rules. || 120 ||

Worship the Jinenndra, Siddha, Sari, Pathakas, Sadhus, and the Shruta, and recite the auspicious words of the Punyavachan here. || 121 ||

1. In this place, consider the direction in which the face of the Jindeva is as the east direction. And since your face is in front of the Deva, consider it as the west direction. This should be understood in all the worship rituals.

**Types of Homa:**

There are three types of homa known to householders, which bring peace: Jal-homa, Baluka-homa, and Kund-homa (Agni-homa). Therefore, householders should always perform these three homas according to their ability. || 164 ||

**Jal-homa:** This is the homa with water, which is described by the Jinas as having a circular kund shape. It is performed in a kund made of copper, clay, or other materials. One should perform it to appease the auspicious Tithi deities, the Grahas, the Suras, and the rest. The wise say that Jal-homa is the best for peace and for removing the effects of evil planets. || 165 ||

A wise Shravak (lay follower) should perform the holy Jal-homa to pacify the malefic planets.  **

**Meaning:**  Construct a round Kund of copper, clay, etc. and perform the Homa in it for peace and to please the Tithi Devata, etc. || 165 ||

**O Dikpalas! You are the ones who punish the world for its wrongdoings. Therefore, I have started this work for the Jinabhisheka (consecration of the Jina image).  You are bound by the devotion to the Dharma (righteousness) and the service of the Bhagavat (the Lord).  You are eager to serve and have come close to me with your hands raised in respect.  You have rejected all other offerings and are filled with enthusiasm for this auspicious bath ceremony. **

Composed by Somasen Bhattaraka:
The five Jinas, the Siddhas, and the Sarvāsadhus are the true gods (Satyadevas) who are the cause of liberation for the virtuous, the yogis, and the readers. || 202 ||

There are four types of gods. One is Satyadeva, the second is Kriyadeva, the third is Kuladeva, and the fourth is Grihadeva. The Arhants, Siddhas, Ācāryas, Upādhyāyas, and Sarvāsadhus are the five true gods (Satyadevas) who are the cause of liberation. || 201 || 202 ||

**Kriyadevas:**
There are three types of Kriyadevas, distinguished by the umbrella, the wheel, and the fire. They are the destroyers of all obstacles and are worshipped with offerings, cooked food, lamps, etc. || 203 ||

**Kuladevas:**
The Kuladevas are those who are considered auspicious by the ancestors of a lineage and who bring continuous happiness. They include Cakreśvari, Ambikā, Padmavati, etc. || 204 ||

**Grihadevas:**
Viśveśvari, Dharanendra, Śrīdevi, and Kubera are the four Grihadevas who are known to increase wealth in the house. || 205 ||

**Satyadevas:**
The Jinas and other gods are the Satyadevas who are the direct cause of merit, liberation, and the giver of liberation. They are worthy of worship and are worshipped by the worthy. || 206 ||

The Kriyadevas are worthy of worship and are the lords of the homa (fire sacrifice) for peace. Viśveśvari is known as the mother of the Jinas. || 207 ||

## Trivarnika Achar (Three-fold Conduct)

**121**

**MARAMMwwwsome**

**Vishveshwari** (Universal Goddess) are highly revered and should be worshipped in the homes of women of noble lineage. ... Those women of noble lineage who worship them will be freed from barrenness and will give birth to good sons. || 208 ||

It is commendable to perform rituals and offer oblations to the **Kriya Devas** (Deities of Action) during the time of peace, as they are the primary masters of this work. The mothers of **Shri Jinendra Deva** are called **Vishveshwari**. Women of noble lineage should ensure that they worship these **Vishveshwari** Deities in their homes. By worshipping them, these women of noble lineage will be freed from barrenness and will give birth to good sons. || 207 || 208 ||

By worshipping **Kubera** (God of Wealth), Lakshmi (Goddess of Wealth) will reside in the home forever. By worshipping **Dharaneendra** (Lord of the Earth), one will obtain excellent sons. || 209 ||

By worshipping **Shri Devi** (Goddess of Prosperity), the child in the womb will not be destroyed. Therefore, one should worship the **Gṛhadeva** (Household Deities) with clothes, ornaments, fruits, and food. || 210 ||

**Jwalini**, **Rohini**, **Chakreswari**, **Padmavati**, **Kushmandini**, **Mahakali**, **Kali**, **Saraswati**, **Gauri**, **Siddhayani**, **Chandi**, and **Durga** are known as **Kuldevata** (Family Deities). Those who desire their own well-being should constantly honor them with devotion. || 211 || 212 ||

**Four types of Devas** should be worshipped by those who desire **Dharma** (Righteousness), **Artha** (Wealth), and **Kama** (Desire). These Devas grant desired objects, remove obstacles, and bestow future success. || 213 || 

Page #161:
---------------------------
## 122
**Somasen Bhattaraka Composed**

Those who worship these Devas, in their homes forever, Lakshmi resides, and cows, horses, buffaloes, and all kinds of wealth also reside forever. || 214 ||

The man who worships these Devas, in his house, by the power of these Devas, in this birth, never experiences any kind of suffering, disease, or illness. || 215 ||

At the end, he takes Sannyasa, and dies in Samadhi, which is a beautiful treasure of infinite happiness, giving liberation and heaven. || 216 ||

Thus, I, Sri Bhattaraka Somasen Gani, have briefly described the proper conduct of worshiping Devas, performing Homa, and daily rituals, as instructed by the Jina. Those virtuous men who perform these actions, obtain the infinite fourfold liberation. || 217 ||

By the grace of Saraswati, learned people compose poetry. Therefore, one should worship Saraswati with devotion in the scriptures. || 218 ||

**Salutation to the World-Honored, the Vasu-Honored, the Illuminator of the Worlds and Non-Worlds.**  I will speak of the mantras for worship, as found in the ancient scriptures, after saluting Him. || 1 ||

**Having risen from the Sandhya-asana, one should go to the Jin-alaya, which is situated in the northeast corner of one's house, after purifying the path of travel.**  One should wash one's feet and open the doors of the house.  One should remove the cloth covering the face and look upon the face of the Jina. || 2-3 ||

## English Translation:

**125**
While walking on the path today, I may have inadvertently offended one-sensed beings and others. If my vision extends beyond four arms, may this sin be nullified by my devotion to the Guru. By reciting this verse, purify the path of walking. || 4 ||

**Opening the Face Veil**
May I offer obeisance to the lotus feet of the Jina. I move aside the face veil, adorned with tinkling golden bells, made of pure, shining silk, with many colors, crafted by skilled artisans. This face veil, which removes all sins, is moved aside. By reciting this verse and mantra, remove the face veil. || 5 ||

**Ritual of the Face Veil**
Om Hrim Mukhamudhatayami Swaha || Opening the Face Veil || 5 ||

**200**

Gazing at the face of the Jina is equivalent to gazing at the face of Lakshmi, meaning attaining the highest wealth. Those who never see the Jina will never attain the happiness of gazing at the face of Lakshmi. They will die as paupers. || 6 ||

Having established the five salutations, place the hands together. **Om Hrim Arh Van Mam Hansam Tam Pam A Si.A U Sa** (chanting this mantra) I make the hand-clasp, **Swaha**.  Thus, the hands are clasped together. This is called **Karannyas**. **32**

Place the five salutations mantras on the base of the little finger and other fingers of both hands (below) on the three lines, then on the lines of the first and second knuckles, and finally on all five fingers together.  While chanting the mantra **Om Hrim Arh Van** etc., clasp both hands together. This is called **Karannyas**. **32**

Then, with both thumbs, perform **Swangannyas**. **Om Hram Namo Arihantaanam Swaha** (chanting this mantra) touch the heart. **Om Him Namo Siddhanam Swaha** (chanting this mantra) touch the forehead. **Om Hum Namo Ayariyanam Swaha** (chanting this mantra) touch the right ear. **Om Hraum Namo Uvvajhayanam Swaha** (chanting this mantra) touch the back of the head. **Om Hram Namo Loe Savvasahunam Swaha** (chanting this mantra) touch the left ear. **Om Hram Namo Arihantaanam Swaha** (chanting this mantra) touch the middle of the head. **Om Hrim Namo Siddhanam Swaha** (chanting this mantra) touch the southeast part of the head. **Om Hum Namo Ayariyanam Swaha** (chanting this mantra) touch the southwest part of the head. **Om Hom Namo Uvvajhayanam Swaha** (chanting this mantra) touch the northwest part of the head. **Om Hah Namo Loe Savvasahunam Swaha** (chanting this mantra) touch the northeast part of the head.

|| Ath Purna-ahuti || Om, may the fifteen Tithi-devas be pleased. May the nine Graha-devas be the destroyers of enemies. May the thirty-two Bhavana-devas, Indras, be joyful. May Indra and the rest, the Vishva Dikpalas, protect. May the non-Indra, non-Maulyudbhava, non-Devatas be pleased. May all the remaining Devas honor the king. May they satisfy the giver. May they praise the Sangha. May they shower rain. May they destroy obstacles. May they prevent death. Om, I offer this complete offering to the glorious, complete, burning, knowing, complete-fruit-yielding, Bhagavan. || This is the Purna-ahuti || 56 ||
Offer the Purna-ahuti with the mantra "Om Tithi-devas" and so on. The Purna-ahuti should be the fruit and the offering material. While chanting the Purna-ahuti mantras, continuously pour a steady stream of ghee. || 16 ||

## Chapter Six

**1.** I bow down to the Infinite Lord, who is endowed with infinite glory, an ocean of infinite virtues, and possessed of infinite bliss. ||1||

Now, the characteristics of the Jain temple are described:

**2.** Having asked the auspicious bird (Shakun) and chanted the Karnapishachini mantra, one should build a beautiful Jain temple according to the instructions of the Guru. ||2||

**3.** One should draw the Karnapishachini Yantra on a bronze vessel according to the aforementioned method. One should chant in front of it. The person chanting should only consume a liquid diet on that day. ||3||

This is how the Yantra should be made:

**ॐ जोगे मग्गे०**
**ॐ ही सः हल्वी ह ही ॐ  _ॐ यन्त्रस्थापना ॐ**

**Meaning of the Mantra:** ॐ Jogge Bhagge Tacche Bhude Bhaven Bhavisse Akkhe Pakkhe Jinparne Shri Hee Stri Karnapishachini Namah.

One should chant this mantra in front of the Yantra.

## Trivarnika Achar

**Verse 4:**
By chanting the mantra "Jati Pushpa Sahasrani" twelve thousand times with the Jati Pushpa flowers, the Samyagdarshi Brahmachari, who performs the Homa ritual according to the prescribed method, attains mastery over the Vidya (Karnapishchni Mantra).

**Verse 5:**
The one who chants the Anahata mantra, which is associated with the Hrim syllable, and whose face radiates light, and whose form resembles a woman, knows and sees his future good and bad fortune.

**Verse 6 & 7:**
One should worship the Bhupatala (foundation of the temple), Kshetra (land), Peetha (platform), Vastu (structure), Dvara (door), and Shila (stone). Then, one should place a statue there and worship it. One should also hoist a flag there. If one desires to build a Jain Chaityalaya (temple) or a Chaitya (shrine) for the well-being of the king and his people, one should not violate the Vastu Shastra. In other words, everything should be done according to the principles of Vastu Shastra.

**Verse 8:**
One should accept a land that is beautiful, pleasant, fragrant, and adorned with Durva grass (Dhoon) etc., and is naturally pure or purified by the Pancha Kalyana of the Jinas, for building a Jain temple.

**Verse 9:**
**Testing the quality of land:**
Dig a pit with a handspan depth. If the soil from the pit fills the pit completely, then the land is considered excellent. If the soil fills the pit with some excess, then the land is considered average. If the soil does not fill the pit completely, then the land is considered inferior. 

Page #197:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Somasen Bhattaraka's Writings:**

Dig a pit in the ground, one hand deep and one hand wide. Fill it with the same soil. If the soil remains higher than the pit after filling, consider the land excellent. If the soil is level with the pit, consider it moderate. If the soil remains lower than the pit, consider it inferior. ||9||

... ... ...

At dusk, when darkness has enveloped the earth, enclose a small area of land with a mat-like barrier to prevent air from entering. On this land, write the mantra "Om Hum Phd" (this is the weapon mantra). Place an unbaked earthen pot on top of the mantra. On the pot, place an unbaked earthen lamp. Fill the lamp with ghee (clarified butter) to the brim. Place a white wick in the east, a red wick in the south, a yellow wick in the west, and a black wick in the north. Light all the wicks and chant the Anadi Siddha mantra over them. If the wicks burn brightly until the ghee is consumed, consider the land auspicious. If they extinguish, consider the land inauspicious. ||10|| ||11|| ||12||

"Om Hum Phd" is the weapon mantra. "Om Namo Arhatananamiti" etc. is the Anadi mantra.

... ... ...

**Patal Vastu Puja:**

... ... ...

After examining the land in this way, worship the Vastu on an auspicious day. Purify the land by sprinkling it with water. Dig a pit in the land. Worship the Patal Vastu in the pit. After filling the pit, a knowledgeable architect should lay the foundation of the building, having carefully examined the directions. ||13|| ||14||

In this way, examine the land, perform its puja on an auspicious day, and purify it by sprinkling water. Dig a pit in it. Worship the Patal Vastu in the pit.

Fill the pit with pieces of stone and level it with the first ground. Thus, knowing the social customs and Vastu Shastra, the householder should begin to build the Jain temple. || 13 || 14 ||

As stated in the scriptures on Pratishtha and other matters, the auspicious Jain temple should be built according to the characteristics of a house. || 15 ||

Place mercury, sandalwood, and saffron at the base. First, place one stone in the center and four stones in the four corners of the womb. || 16 ||

Place five stones on top of them in order. Worship the five supreme beings with separate mantras. || 17 ||

Give gifts and honor to the workers. To appease all obstacles, worship the area. || 18 ||

Then, build the foundation of the temple according to its design. First, the womb, then the door, and then the place for urination. || 19 ||

Then, arrange the mandapa, the best place for the platform. On the side of the door, build a beautiful picture gallery. || 20 ||

Build a place for lectures, a beautiful theater, and a place for musical instruments. Build a beautiful pillar of honor. || 21 ||

After completing the Jain temple with all these characteristics, the sculptor should go to bring the image of the Jina. || 22 ||

On an auspicious day and under a good constellation, with the sound of musical instruments, in famous holy places, on the banks of rivers, and in forests, || 23 ||

Bring a hard, pleasant, and melodious stone. The skilled sculptors should make the image of the Jina. || 24 || 

Page #199:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

**Somasen Bhattaraka's Composition:**

Afterward, according to the length and width of the Jain temple, a platform should be built for the "Peethavandh" (altar). First, the "Garbhagar" (sanctum sanctorum) should be constructed. Following this, the doors, the "Sutranivas" (a place for scriptures), the "Mandap" (hall), and the "Vedika" (platform) should be built in sequence. Outside the doors of the "Mandap", four "Paswad" (wings) should be constructed: a beautiful "Chitrashala" (picture gallery), a "Swadhyaya Shala" (study hall), a "Natya Shala" (theater) adorned with various paintings, a "Vayashala" (music hall), and a beautiful "Manastambh" (pillar of thought). The Jain temple should be built with all these auspicious features.

When the temple is complete, take the artisans along with you and, on an auspicious day, go to bring the stone for making the "Jinabimb" (statue of the Tirthankara) with music and grand decorations. After visiting famous and sacred places, go to rivers, mountains, and forests to find a smooth, hard, pleasant, and resonant stone. Bring this excellent stone and entrust it to skilled sculptors for making the "Jinabimb".  || 19 ||

**Characteristics of the Jinabimb:**

The "Jinabimb" should be free from hair, marks of shaving, and lines. It should have straight, long, hanging hands, the "Srivatsa" mark, and be "Digambar" (sky-clad). It should be in either "Khadgasana" (standing posture) or "Palyankasana" (lotus posture), according to the principles of sculpture. It should be free from weapons, women, and defects like raised eyebrows. It should be free from ornaments and have a cheerful face and eyes. The "Jinabimb" can be made of stone, gold, silver, brass, bronze, coral, pearls, and precious gems like lapis lazuli. It can also be made of paintings, plaster, or even sandalwood. It should have eight "Pratihar" (guards) and all auspicious limbs. The "Jinabimb" should be made by a worthy person, with its limbs imbued with the essence of emotions. || 25-29 ||

The "Jinabimb" that is made should possess these characteristics. 

Page #200:
---------------------------
## Trivarnika Achar

The image should be **mararmnirurwwmar**, adorned with eight **pratiharys** like a parasol and a fly whisk, with a complete and auspicious physical form, appearing to draw in the emotions of humans, signifying the attainment of **vitragata** (freedom from attachment). || 25 || 26 || 27 || 28 || 29 ||

Even the **siddh-bimba** (image of a liberated soul) should be pure and similar, following the **agama** (scriptural texts) for the **suris** (teachers), **pathkas** (students), and **sadhus** (ascetics). || 30 ||

On the left, there should be a **yakshi** (female celestial being), and on the right, a **yaksha** (male celestial being). Below, there should be the **navagrahas** (nine planets), and in the middle of the back, the **kshetrapal** (guardian deity of the area). || 31 ||

The images of the **yakshas** and **yakshis**, as well as the deities, should be adorned with all ornaments, and should be depicted with their respective vehicles and weapons, making them beautiful in every way. || 32 ||

Even if the image is adorned with the aforementioned characteristics, it will not be pleasing if the eyes are not properly depicted. Therefore, the eyes should be made clear. || 33 ||

The eyes of the image, as well as any deficiencies or excesses in the limbs and appendages, have consequences. A downward gaze brings fear of **tiryag** (lower births), loss of wealth, and long-term suffering. An upward gaze brings the death of the wife and the loss of children. || 34 ||

A gaze that is constantly sorrowful, anxious, and agitated brings constant loss of wealth. A peaceful gaze brings good fortune, children, peace, and prosperity. || 35 ||

A **sadopa** (image with a raised hand) should not be made, as it brings misfortune. A **raudri** (fierce) image, a thin-bodied image, or an image with a **dravyasamkshaya** (loss of wealth) should be made. || 36 ||

A **sankshriptaangi** (image with shortened limbs) brings loss, a **chipita** (image with a pinched face) brings suffering, a **vinetra** (image without eyes) brings blindness, and a **heenavaktra** (image with a small mouth) brings a life of deprivation. || 37 ||

##  The Jain Image: A Guide to Proper Installation and Worship

**Verse 38:** A large-bellied image brings illness, a thin-chested one causes heart disease, a limbless one destroys offspring, and one with dry shanks brings harm to kings.

**Verse 39:** A footless image destroys people, a waistless one destroys vehicles. Knowing these defects, one should worship a Jain image free from flaws.

**Commentary:** If an image has a crooked gaze, it brings financial ruin, widespread opposition, and various fears to the creator. A downward gaze leads to the loss of a son, an upward gaze to the death of a wife, causing grief, anxiety, distress, and financial ruin. A peaceful image brings good fortune, offspring, and peace. Never create a flawed image, as it brings misfortune. A Rudra-like image destroys the owner, a thin-bodied one depletes wealth, a shrunken-limbed one destroys the family, a flat one brings sorrow, an eyeless one destroys eyesight, a mouthless one steals pleasures. A large-bellied one brings illness, a thin-chested one causes heart disease, a limbless one destroys offspring, and one with dry shanks brings harm to kings. A footless image destroys people, a waistless one destroys vehicles. Knowing these defects, one should worship a Jain image free from flaws.

**Verse 40:** One should install an image according to one's capacity and the teachings of the Guru. One should worship a stable or movable image.

**Commentary:** Install an image according to your ability and the guidance of your Guru. Establish a stable or movable image and worship it.

**Verse 41:** An image suitable for home worship should be no larger than twelve angulas (finger widths), starting from one-eighth of a yava (barley grain) in size. Never worship an image larger than this in your home.

**Commentary:** The size of a home image should be at least one-eighth of a barley grain and at most twelve angulas (one span). Do not exceed this size.

**Verse 42:** Never worship an image larger than a vitasti (span) in your home.

**ANNA**

The characteristics of a Chaitya and Chaityalaya have been briefly described. Now, we will discuss the considerations regarding Vandana (worship) and other aspects. || 42 ||

Leaving the Homa Shala (place of fire rituals), with a calm mind, always fearing the dangers of the world, a devout person, with excellent offerings, should proceed towards the Jain temple, adorned with bells and flags, situated in the heart of the city, a place for practicing Dharma and meditation, a source of happiness. Like a monk, he should set out from his home. || 43 ||

Standing outside, with a respectful bow, he should praise the glorious Jain temple, filled with supreme bliss. || 44 ||

He should offer salutations, reciting this verse: "May the Jina, who has conquered the god of love in an instant, who is established in the essence of right conduct, who has shed the burden of the four great sins, who has attained the shore of true knowledge, who is blessed with the offerings of the gods, whose abode is highly praiseworthy, and who has acquired excellent merit, be my benefactor." || 45 || 

Page #203:
---------------------------
**Somaseṇabhaṭṭāraka Composed**

A beautiful temple, adorned with tall gateways, surrounded by a charming wall, with halls and toranas, filled with auspicious crowds, resounding with the sounds of music and instruments, a magnificent and auspicious temple, like Mount Meru, should be seen by the Śrāvaka. || 46 ||

**Praise of the Caitya**

Where garlands of flowers hang from the doorways, large incense burners are placed, young women wave fly whisks, dancers dance and sing auspicious songs, where golden pots are placed on the high peaks, flags flutter, where beings of all the seven classes, gods, humans, animals, lions, etc., dwell together, abandoning their hatred. || 47 ||

I take refuge in this holy, spotless, eternal, self-existent, auspicious, primary pilgrimage site, a constant festival, a jewel-like abode of the Jinas, the ornament of the three worlds. || 48 ||

Victorious is this Jain Caitya, beautiful, the support of the lineage, the abode of the gods and kings, the source of great merit, with a banner that spreads like a coral branch, with a peak that shines brightly. || 49 || 

Page #204:

The great mountain from which the river of nectar, the glory of gods and kings, flows, which is extremely radiant to mothers, whose flags waving on the peak appear as if the new tender buds of the Kalpavriksha, the tree of Dharma, are bearing fruit all around, and which is the abode of Lakshmi, such a Shri Jin Mandir remains victorious. || 49 ||
Entering the temple. Having described thus, one should go to the Jinenadra Bhavan.
Having gone and sat down in the hall, one should wash one's feet. || 50 ||
Having described thus, one should go to the Shri Jin Mandir, sit in the bathing hall and wash one's feet. || 50 ||
With a very soft voice, one should utter the word "Nisahi" three times in one's mind.
While uttering it, one should look at the Jain image with devotion from the doorway. || 51 ||
Entering the doorway of the Shri Jin Mandir, one should utter the word "Nisahi" three times in one's pure heart with a very soft voice. While uttering it, one should look at the Shri Jin image with devotion from the doorway. || 51 ||
Having circumambulated the supreme Jin image three times, one should place both hands on one's forehead and bow.
One should praise the Jinendra with his own virtues, condemning one's own many faults. || 52 ||
After that, one should circumambulate the Shri Jin image three times (parikrama), place both hands on one's head and bow. And while condemning one's own many faults, one should praise the Shri Jinenadra with his excellent qualities. || 52 ||
One should honor the doorkeepers and those who are different from oneself, both high and low.
Standing in the left part of the inner sanctum, one should praise the Jin. || 53 ||
After that, one should honor the doorkeepers and those who are different from oneself, both high and low. Taking them to the left side, one should go inside the inner sanctum and stand there, and read the praise of Shri Jindev like this (1). || 53 ||
Praise of Shri Jin. Your form is peaceful, pure, adorned with the luminous sphere, your voice is the destroyer of all sounds, O Jinapati! May the twelve-fold doctrine be your guide. Your life is dedicated to the welfare of all beings, therefore, those who have knowledge of the scriptures, seek refuge in you alone, and are quickly freed from the suffering of the world. || 54 ||

O Jinapati! Your body is extremely peaceful, pure, devoid of sins, and adorned with a halo. Your divine sound attracts ears and reveals the nature of Syadvada like a fruit held in the hand. Your pure conduct benefits all beings in the world. Therefore, scholars and other humans alike seek refuge in you alone to eradicate the suffering of the world. ||54||

O Swami! Today, I have emerged from the dark well of my mother's womb. Today, I have opened my eyes. Today, my birth has become fruitful. When I see you, the moon-like one, who nourishes the lotus-grove of the eyes of the three worlds, and who showers nectar-like radiance, I feel as if I have been liberated from the bondage of suffering. ||55||

O Deva! I have seen the abode of the elixir that destroys the most severe diseases. I have seen the place of great treasures. I have seen the palace of the nectar of Siddhi. I have seen the supreme abode of the Chintamani. But what is the purpose of seeing these things that provide only temporary benefits? The real purpose is that today I have seen the Sri Jinamandir. It feels as if I have witnessed the auspicious marriage of the woman of liberation. ||56||

O Jin, the Lord of the three worlds! Seeing you, adorned with your majesty, my eyes have become successful. My mind has become pure, enlightened, and extremely joyful. Therefore, may your darshan, which eradicates sins from the root, continue to be mine. ||57||

**Somasen Bhattaraka's Composition**

**Worship of the Jinas**

One should perform the worship of the Jinas with auspicious eightfold offerings. Then, one should worship the scriptures, the Guru, and the Siddhas with utmost devotion. (71)

**Description of Scripture Worship**

Those devotees who worship the scriptures with devotion, they worship the Jinas in essence. There is no difference between the scriptures and the Jinas, as the scriptures themselves declare. (72)

**Description of Guru Worship**

Those who desire liberation and happiness should constantly serve the Guru without negligence. For those who remain under the protection of the Guru, like a Garuda under the shade of its wings, are free from the serpents of obstacles in their religious endeavors. (73)

**Chapter 75**

There are four types of Trivarnika Achar, and the fifth type is Chaturmuh.

**Chapter 76**

**Nitya Mah Puja**

The characteristics of Nitya Mah Puja are as follows:

* Daily, taking incense, flowers, akshat, etc. from one's own home and performing puja in the Chaityaalaya to the Jina Bhagwan.
* Building Jina Bimba, Jina Mandir, etc. according to one's own wealth.
* Giving donations to the temple, village, house, etc. according to the political situation, with devotion, by writing stamps or registering them.
* Performing daily worship of the Arhant Dev in one's own home or in the Jina Mandir, three times a day, in the morning, afternoon, and evening.
* Offering food to the monks daily and worshipping them.

**Chapter 77**

**Ashtahnhik and Indra Dhwaj Puja**

* The puja performed by the righteous on the Nandishwar Parva, with Indra and others, is called Ashtahnhik.
* The grand puja performed by Indra and others is called Indra Dhwaj.

The Ashtahnhik Mah is performed for eight days, from the eighth day of the bright fortnight of Ashadh, Kartik, and Falgun, until the full moon. Many devout people gather together to perform puja to the Arhant Dev.

**Chapter 78**

**Chaturmuh Mah**

The characteristics of Chaturmuh Mah are as follows:

* The puja performed by crowned kings with devotion is called Chaturmuh, Sarvatobhadra, and Mahamah.

This puja is for the benefit of all beings, hence it is called Sarvatobhadra. It is performed in a mandap with four doors, hence it is called Chaturmuh. It is greater than the Ashtahnhik Mah, hence it is called Mahamah.

**Characteristics of Kalpadruma Puja**

Whoever, by giving alms, fulfills the aspirations of the world, is considered a Kalpadruma Yajna, performed by Chakravartis. || 79 ||

What you desire, in the form of a question, fulfilling the aspirations of all the humans in the world, the worship performed by Chakravarti kings is called Kalpadruma Yajna. || 79 ||

Whatever is done daily and on special occasions, like offering Bali (pulses, rice, bread, etc.), abhisheka (ceremonial bath), dance, singing, playing music, pratiṣṭhā (installation), rathayātrā (chariot procession), etc., should be included in these daily and occasional rituals as appropriate. || 80 ||

The meaning is - Abhisheka (ceremonial bath) of the Supreme Being, dancing, singing, playing music, rathayātrā (chariot procession), pilgrimage to Girnar, Sammed Shikhar, etc., are all included in the various types of daily and occasional worship. || 80 ||

The fruit of every worship with water, fragrance, etc. || 81 ||

The stream of water offered to the feet of Shri Jinendra Deva, according to the prescribed rituals, pacifies the karma of knowledge-obscuring, etc. The application of pure fragrance gives a pleasant smell to the body. Offering Akshata (unbroken rice grains) ensures that the power of Aṇimā (the power to become small) and wealth never perish. Offering a garland of flowers grants garlands of Kalpavriksha (wish-fulfilling trees) in heaven. Offering Naivedya (food offering) makes one the master of infinite Lakshmi (wealth). Offering a lamp increases radiance. Offering incense brings supreme good fortune. Offering fruits grants desired fruits. Offering Arghya (water offering) and Pushpanjali (offering of flowers) brings special respect. || 81 ||

**Order of Worship**

After completing the worship, with devotion, praise Jinendra Deva, and again bow to him. Then, in order, honor the deities like Padma, etc., who preside over the scriptures. || 82 || 

Page #212:
---------------------------
**Trivarnika Achar...**  pay respects to the Kshatrapala and Padmavati, etc., the ruling deities. || 82 ||

Then, coming together in the assembly hall, one should respectfully salute the learned Muni. ...
With devotion, one should inquire about the well-being of the body and its origin. || 83 || After coming to the assembly hall, one should respectfully salute the scriptures and the Muni, and inquire about the Muni Maharaj's physical well-being. || 83 ||

Daily vows to be taken.  Digvirati, Deshavirati, Anarthadanda, etc., and the essence of oil, ghee, etc. ||
One should take the daily vows in the presence of the Guru, which are conducive to happiness. || 84 || After that, in the presence of the Guru, one should take the vows of Digvirati, Deshavirati, Anarthadanda, etc., and the renunciation of oil, ghee, etc., and their essence. This is the daily vow to be taken. Meaning - I will not go outside this country today, I will not go in this direction, I will not do any work without purpose. I will not eat oil today, I will not eat ghee today, I will not eat jaggery-sugar today, I will not eat salt today, etc., these rules should be taken. || 84 ||

The greatness of taking vows.  Even the purified, who are worthy of worship, are greatly blessed with prosperity.
They seek refuge in the purified, what to speak of those who are adorned with four virtues. || 85 || The wealth of greatness, command, power, strength, family, enjoyment, and the means of enjoyment, etc., are very quickly sought refuge in the purified men who are free from vows and have pure vision, who worship the Arhant Dev, as if they are jealous of each other, thinking, "I will obtain this first." Then, what to speak of the Shravakas who are purified by right vision and adorned with the vows of non-violence, truth, etc., who worship the Shri Jin Dev, that these wealth seek refuge in them - there is nothing surprising in this. Meaning - These wealth seek refuge in men who are adorned with vows in a special way. || 85 ||

The way to salute the Guru, etc.  One should salute the Guru with "Namo astu," the Brahmachari with "Vandana," the fellow-religionists with "Ichchhakar," and the Arjikas with "Nandami." || 86 || One should salute the Gurus with "Namo astu," the Brahmachari with "Vandana," the fellow-religionists with "Ichchhakar," and the Arjikas with "Nandami." || 86 ||

**The Blessings Worthy of Being Given by the Guru**

**Verse 87**
The Muni-Indras, who give growth to the Dharma of the Shravakas, should say to them, "May there be growth in your Dharma." To the others, the non-Jains, they should say, "May you attain Dharma."

**Verse 88**
The Aryikas should say the same to the Shravakas and the non-Jains. And the Brahmachari should say, "May there be an increase in your merit," or "May your vision be purified." This is the opinion of some.

**Verse 89**
The Shravakas should engage in mutual goodwill, and in this worldly conduct, the virtuous should greet each other with the salutation, "Juhāru."

**Verse 90**
**Practical Conduct**
Seeing a person who is worthy or unworthy, one should behave with humility, etc. A person who is superior in knowledge, austerity, and qualities, even if he is young, is considered great.

**Verse 91**
One should comfort the sick and suffering Jain followers with soothing words and try to resolve their problems.

**Verse 92**
One should avoid those who are foolish, ignorant, arrogant, engage in pointless arguments, and are outside the Jain Dharma. Instead, one should remain silent.

**Respectful Conduct**

Those who are deeply devoted to Jainism and are very humble, should be addressed with respectful words, raising one's head in their presence. || 93 ||

**Study and Discussion of Scriptures**

After discarding pride, one should sit humbly before the Guru and listen to the secrets of the scriptures, which reveal the essence of truth. || 94 ||

**Sharing Knowledge**

One should also share the scriptures with others, either by oneself or by inspiring them to do so, with a mindful heart, for the purpose of spreading Dharma. || 95 ||

**Core Principles of Jainism**

The seven principles of Jainism - Jiva (living beings), Ajeeva (non-living matter), Asrava (inflow of karma), Bandha (bondage of karma), Samvara (restriction of inflow), Nirjara (destruction of karma), and Moksha (liberation) - are clearly explained in the Jina Agama. || 96 ||

**Understanding the Elements**

The six substances - Jiva, Pudgala (matter), Dharma (principle of motion), Adharma (principle of rest), Akasha (space), and Kala (time) - and the five Astikayas (categories of living beings) excluding Kala, along with the principles of the Yati (monk) and Shravaka (lay follower) should be explained clearly. || 97 ||

**Refuting False Beliefs**

One should refute false beliefs by using the principles of Anekanta (multi-faceted truth), Pramana (proof), Nay (perspective), and Nikshepa (classification), and illuminate the path of Jainism. || 98 ||

**Understanding Karma**

One should explain the concepts of punya (merit), punya-phala (fruits of merit), papa (demerit), and papa-phala (fruits of demerit). Acts of compassion and charity lead to punya, while violence, lying, stealing, indulging in sensual pleasures, and attachment lead to papa. || 99 ||

**Seeking Guidance**

One should diligently study the scriptures and seek guidance from learned Yatis (monks) and other knowledgeable individuals. || 100 ||

**Alternative Approach**

Alternatively, one can also share the scriptures with other followers of the Dharma with great care and attention. || 

Page #215:

**Composed by Somasen Bhattaraka**

This explains in detail the secrets of Dharma, such as what constitutes sin, etc. It also inspires the desire to listen to and teach the scriptures of the Munis and Pandits, or to serve and cause others to serve. ||95||96||97||98||99||100||

One should again offer salutations to the Jinas and Jain Dharma practitioners. After inquiring about the well-being of the Guru, etc., one should return to one's home. ||101||

Upon returning home, one should bathe as before, perform Japa, Homa, worship of the Jina, Achamana, Pranayama, pouring water on the head, offering Arghya, etc. One should not perform any worship, etc., with hot water. ||102|| ||103||

**Offering of Patra**

Then, at the time of eating, one should perform Patra Dana. This is the best cause for attaining Bhoga Bhoomi and heaven. ||104||

**Types of Patra**

There are four types of Patra, known here, which bring happiness in this life and the next. It is considered supreme due to the distinction between Dharma Patra, Bhoga Patra, Yasha Patra, and Seva Patra. ||105||

**Types of Dharma Patra**

There are three types of Dharma Patra: inferior, middle, and superior. One should always give to these, as they bring happiness in the next life. ||106|| 

Page #216:
---------------------------
## Trivarnika Achar

**177**

There are three types of recipients of Dharma: **Jghanya**, **Madhyama**, and **Uttama**. One should always give donations to those who will bring happiness in the afterlife. || 106 ||

**Characteristics of a Jghanya recipient:**

One who possesses **Samyagdristi**, is virtuous, devoted to the practices of a Shravak, is devoted to their Guru, and is humble is called a **Jghanya** recipient. || 107 ||

**Meaning:** A Shravak who continuously possesses **Samyagdristi** is a **Jghanya** recipient. Being devoted to the practices of a Shravak means following the main principles of a Shravak, such as not eating at night, drinking filtered water, worshipping the Jinas, and abstaining from alcohol, meat, honey, and forbidden foods. || 107 ||

**Characteristics of a Madhyama recipient:**

One who is committed to the vow of **Brahmacharya**, free from worldly attachments, and possesses minimal possessions is called a **Madhyama** recipient. || 108 ||

**Meaning:** Those who have renounced the world from the first to the eleventh **Pratima** are **Madhyama** recipients. || 108 ||

**Characteristics of an Uttama recipient:**

One who possesses the twenty-eight **Mulagunas**, is free from all possessions, is forgiving, is an ocean of good conduct, views friends and enemies with equanimity, is devoted to meditation and study, desires liberation, and is the master of the **Ratnatraya** is known as an **Uttama** recipient. || 109 || 110 ||

**Virtuous individuals should give donations to all three types of recipients, Jghanya, Madhyama, and Uttama. This is for the sake of worldly and otherworldly prosperity, and for the ultimate truth.** || 111 || 

Page #217:
---------------------------
## 178
##  Somasen Bhattaraka Composed

**Dharmatmas** should give charity to all three types of recipients: **Jghanya** (low), **Madhyama** (middle), and **Uttama** (high). Giving charity to these recipients is the cause of acquiring real wealth in this world and the next. **Meaning:** Those Dharmatmas who give charity to all three types of recipients receive various kinds of material comforts, which are the cause of attaining supreme happiness in both worlds. || 111 ||

**Characteristics of Bhoga Patra:** Bhoga Patra is that which gives worldly happiness, like a wife, etc. One should give them good ornaments, clothes, etc., according to one's capacity, for the sake of Dharma. || 112 ||

**Consequences of not giving charity to Bhoga Patra:** If one does not give charity to them, they will not listen to one's words, and worship, etc., will not be done properly in the house. Therefore, one should definitely give charity to Bhoga Patra. || 113 ||

**Characteristics of Yasha Patra:** Bhatta, etc., are Yasha Patra, who spread fame in the world. One should give them a lot of wealth for their fame and happiness. || 114 ||

**Consequences of not giving charity to Yasha Patra:** To be born in the world without fame is useless. Such a birth causes pain in the heart day and night, there is extreme distress in the mind, and due to distress in the mind, there is heavy sorrow, which leads to the bondage of sinful karma. Therefore, one should behave properly for the sake of fame. || 115 || 

Page #218:
---------------------------
## Trivarnika Achar

**Characteristics of those deserving service:** Service should be given to those who are servants, maids, and employees, etc. 
**What should be given to them:** Clothes, food, and other things as desired and appropriate. || 116 ||

**Compassionate Giving:**  One should give charity to all beings according to one's capacity, out of compassion. 
**For cows, buffaloes, etc.:** Water and grass should be provided. || 117 ||

**Meaning:** A Shravak who is involved in heavy endeavors should establish institutions like Pinjrapole, etc., and protect cows, etc. They should also build food shelters and water fountains for the blind, lame, and disabled. And all Shravaks should give charity according to their capacity. || 117 ||

**Fruits of Different Types of Charity:** Giving to the deserving brings about a bond of Dharma. Giving to others besides the deserving is a great act of compassion. Giving to a friend increases affection. Giving to an enemy destroys enmity. Giving to a servant brings about devotion. Giving to a king brings about respect in the royal court and elsewhere. Giving to a Bhatta, Brahmin, etc., brings about fame. Therefore, no charity given to anyone is ever fruitless. Therefore, one should give charity according to one's capacity. || 118 ||

**Those who are worthy of charity:** Those who spend their days sleeping, lying down, and licking their thumbs are not worthy. Those who walk with their feet, those who climb mountains with their hands, those who are unsteady, those who are strong, those who are skilled and talented, those who are young and enjoying life, and those who are fortunate are all worthy of charity. || 119 || 

Page #219:

##  The Aryas in the Bhoga-bhoomi

**Somasen Bhattaraka** has written that the Aryas are those who are born in the Bhoga-bhoomi after giving **daan** (donation). These Aryas, in the first week, sleep with their faces upwards and suck their thumbs. In the second week, they crawl on their bellies and slowly start walking on their knees. In the third week, they start speaking sweet words and walk unsteadily. In the fourth week, they walk steadily with firm steps. In the fifth week, they become adorned with arts like singing and playing music, and with qualities like beauty. In the sixth week, they become young and capable of enjoying their desired pleasures. In the seventh week, they become eligible to receive **Samyak Darshan** (right faith). The author expresses surprise with the words, "Look at the greatness of **daan** that makes these people, born in the Bhoga-bhoomi, eligible in such a short time!" || 119 ||

**Types of Daan**

**Ahaar Shastra Bhaishajya Abhay Daanani Sarvatah |
Chaturvidhani Deyani Munibhyas Tattva Vedibhih || 120 ||**

Those who know the true nature of things should give four types of **daan** to the **munis** (ascetics): **Ahaar Daan** (food donation), **Shastra Daan** (knowledge donation), **Bhaishajya Daan** (medicine donation), and **Abhay Daan** (protection donation). || 120 ||

**Fruits of Each Daan**

**Gyaanavan Gyaan Daanena Nirbhay Abhay Daanatah |
Anna Daanat Sukhi Nityam Nirvyaadhi Bhaishajad Bhavet || 121 ||**

By giving **Shastra Daan**, one becomes knowledgeable. By giving **Abhay Daan**, one becomes fearless. By giving **Ahaar Daan**, one becomes happy. By giving **Bhaishajya Daan**, one becomes free from diseases. || 121 ||

**Uttar Purana** says:

**Shastra Abhyanna Daanani Proktani Jin Sattamaih |
Purva Purva Bahu Patta Phalani Imani Dhimatam || 122 ||**

The **Jinas** (victorious ones) have said that **Shastra Daan**, **Abhay Daan**, and **Anna Daan** are the three types of **daan**. Among these, **Ahaar Daan** yields more fruit than **Abhay Daan**, and **Abhay Daan** yields more fruit than **Shastra Daan**. || 122 ||

**Types of Daan for the Poor**

**Kanya Hasti Suvarna Vajika Pila Daasi Tila: Syandanam |
Kshma Geham Pratibandham Atra Dashadha Daan Daridrepsitam ||**

**Kanya Daan** (daughter donation), **Hasti Daan** (elephant donation), **Suvarna Daan** (gold donation), **Vajika Daan** (horse donation), **Pila Daan** (cow donation), **Daasi Daan** (female servant donation), **Tila Daan** (sesame seed donation), **Syandan Daan** (chariot donation), **Kshma Daan** (land donation), and **Geham Daan** (house donation) are the ten types of **daan** that are desirable for the poor. 

Page #220:
---------------------------
## Trivarnika Achar

**181**

**1.23**

The ten types of gifts for the poor, namely: a daughter, an elephant, gold, a horse, a cow, a slave girl, sesame seeds, land, property, and a house, were invented by Mundshalayan, the son of Bhootisharma, who was greedy for various things at the end of the Tirthankara Shitalnath's Tirtha. These gifts are not mentioned in the Vitaraga scriptures, as their originator was a selfish and greedy man. Therefore, these gifts are considered inferior. However, if these gifts are given with the intentions mentioned below, they are neither inferior nor a cause for sin. **123**

**124**

Gifts like land, etc., should be given to the deserving, considering their worthiness, after careful deliberation. The great souls should give these ten gifts to the lowest of the deserving. **124**

**125**

If there is a doubt about giving these gifts to others, it is said that there is no need to give these gifts to the middle or the highest deserving. Instead, they should be given the four types of gifts mentioned earlier: food, medicine, scriptures, and protection. **125**

**126**

A wise person should build a temple for the Jina, install an image, and perform the consecration ceremony. He should also satisfy the entire Jain community with gold. **126**

**127**

For the worship of the Jina, one should give good fertile land, villages, houses, etc., so that the income from them can be used for the worship of the Jina. Also, for the consecration of the Jina, one should give a cow, whose pure milk can be used for the milk bath of the Jina. This is the opinion of the Acharyas. **127**

**128**

A pure Shravak son, who is righteous and poor, should be given a daughter in marriage for the sake of Dharma's stability. **128**

*Without a wife, the household practices of the householder cannot be maintained.
*Giving gifts, performing worship, and other such activities are necessary for the continuation of the lineage.*

**Explanation:**
*The Dharma (religion) is sustained by the efforts of righteous men. Therefore, to ensure the continuity of the Dharma, righteous men should give their daughters to the sons of Shravakas (lay followers).
*If a daughter is given with the intention of maintaining the Dharma, it is not a sin but a righteous act.
*However, if a daughter is given for the sake of worldly desires, it is a sin.
*The practice of marriage in our tradition is intended to maintain the Dharma.
*Those who believe that parents marry off their daughters for the sake of worldly pleasures are ignorant of Jain scriptures and deceive people by hiding the true meaning of the scriptures.
*The marriage of a daughter is a Dharma. This topic has been explained in detail by Pandit Ashadharji in the Sagara Dharma Amrit. Righteous men should understand this topic well.

**130**
*Even if a son of a Shravaka is poor due to his karma, but is devoted to the practices of a Shravaka, he should be given gold for the sake of his household practices.*

**Explanation:**
*By giving gold, he will be free from worry and will remain steadfast in his Dharma. He will strive with all his might for the propagation and promotion of the Dharma, and his household practices will continue. Therefore, such a person should be given gold.
*Giving gold for the sake of Dharma is not a sin.

**131**
*For a Shravaka who has no shelter, is destitute, and protects the practices of a Shravaka, a house should be given as a gift for the purpose of worship, giving gifts, and other such activities.*

For one who is unable to walk and diligently performs the duties of a Shravak, such as chanting the puja mantra, a chariot, horse, or other means of transport should be given for pilgrimage to Tirth Kshetras. || 132 ||
For a Jain Brahmin, Bhatta, or other worthy person, an elephant should be given as a gift for the purpose of gaining fame and influence. || 133 ||
On a difficult and muddy path, devoid of water sources, a water stop should be established with purified water. || 134 ||
According to one's ability, a food shelter should be established in every village. In the winter, warm clothing made of cotton should be given to deserving men. || 135 ||
For deserving individuals, bronze vessels should be given for the purpose of eating and drinking. For Mahavrati Yatis, a peacock feather and a water pot should be given. || 136 ||
For the worship of the Jina, articles of worship should be given. For a learned Pandit who is proficient in mantras and rituals, ornaments should be given. || 137 ||

Do not donate these things. Weapons of violence, roots, tubers, meat, liquor, honey.  Food that is contaminated, tasty food that is spoiled, subtle food, food eaten at night.  False scriptures, medical science, astrology, drama, and scriptures that teach violence.  Aphrodisiacs, scriptures that teach mantras of violence, and scriptures that indicate a great war.  Do not give these to those of low intellect, who promote violence.  || 138 || 139 || 140 ||

Do not give anything to them, it will only increase their sins.  || 142 ||  The one who is intoxicated, wicked, mocks Jainism, is involved in the sin of violence, consumes liquor and meat, speaks falsehoods, and insults the Gods and Gurus, should not be given anything.  Giving them anything will only increase their sins.  This 142nd verse states that one should not give anything to those who insult the Gods and Gurus.  This is very logical because those who insult the Gods and Gurus will definitely spread wrong conduct, which will only increase sin.  There are many current examples of this.  Many people have started to insult Jainism and Jain Acharyas.  Those who have started doing this openly support widow remarriage, breaking the caste system, eating with everyone on the same plate, etc.  The Jain community is taking on the burden of the great sin of giving donations to such people.  This is very surprising.  || 141 || 142 ||

What is stated in the false scriptures by the greedy and lustful Brahmins, that should not be given, such as goats, women, and other things that are violent, like footwear. || 143 ||
Very greedy Brahmins have written in false scriptures that one should give goats, women, etc. as donations. This should not be done. Also, do not give violent things like footwear. || 143 ||

##  Recipients of Donations.
One should spend their wealth in these seven places: building a Chaitya, building a Chaityaalaya, writing scriptures, renovating scriptures, and the four Sanghas. Otherwise, their wealth will be useless. || 144 ||
One should spend their wealth on building a Chaitya, building a Chaityaalaya, writing scriptures, renovating scriptures, and the four Sanghas. These are the seven places where a Shravak should spend their wealth. Otherwise, their wealth will be useless. || 144 ||

## Praise for the Generous.
Sripena Maharaja, by giving food to the Charan Munis, Aditya Gati and Arinjaya, was born in the first excellent Bhogabhoomi. After enjoying heavenly pleasures many times, he finally attained the position of Shantinath Tirthankara and attained liberation. Here, only the cause is shown, meaning he did not become a Tirthankara just by giving food, but he attained such merit and position through the power of food donation, which enabled him to bind the nature of a Tirthankara. If he had not given food, he would not have received that merit and position, which would have enabled him to bind the nature of a Tirthankara. Therefore, even in his position as a Tirthankara, food donation is the cause.
A daughter-in-law of the Devakul king used to give medicine donations. She cured a Muni by giving him medicine. As a result, she was reborn as the daughter of a wealthy merchant named Vrishabhasena and received the Siddhi called Sarvoshadhi, which cured all diseases like fever, diarrhea, etc.
A pig, in his previous birth, had the intention of building a residence for the Munis and protected a Muni in his pig form. Due to the good results of these two actions, he was reborn as a Siddhi-bearing Deva in the Saudharma heaven.
Govinda, a cowherd, worshipped the scriptures and gave them to the Munis. Due to the influence of this donation, he became a Muni named Kaundesh and crossed the ocean of knowledge of the twelve Angas.
These are four examples of the four types of donations. There are many others, but only four are mentioned here. || 145 ||

I have briefly explained the characteristics of giving charity for householders. Having given charity according to one's ability, the Shravaka should eat themselves. || 146 ||
wwwwwww
##  Food - Method |
Having washed hands, feet, and mouth, one should properly perform Achaman with water. Calling one's relatives, one should seat them in one's own row. || 147 ||
##  Row Distinction |
In the house of a Kshatriya, Brahmanas should eat, in the house of a Vaishya, Kshatriyas should eat, and in the house of a Kshatriya, Vaishyas should eat, in separate rows. || 148 || In the house of a Brahmana, all except Kshatriyas should eat. Shudras should eat in the houses of all, being of low and high conduct. || 149 ||
As the order of eating has been explained, one should eat in one's own separate row. Brahmanas in the row of Brahmanas, Kshatriyas in the row of Kshatriyas, Vaishyas in the row of Vaishyas, and Shudras in the row of Shudras of their own worth. It is not that Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras should eat in the row of Brahmanas, Brahmanas, Vaishyas, and Shudras should eat in the row of Kshatriyas, Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Shudras should eat in the row of Vaishyas, and Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas should eat in the row of Shudras. And from this, it is also found that no one should eat in the house of a Shudra. Similarly, a low Shudra should eat in the house of a high Shudra, but a high Shudra should not eat in the house of a low Shudra. || 148-149 ||
##  Inappropriate Places for Eating |
Places covered with ashes, leftover food, pus, leather, blood, cow dung, mud, foul smell, darkness, disease, and pain. || 150 ||

**Somasen Bhattaraka's Composition:**

**Food to be Abandoned:**

Upon seeing the corpses of dead creatures, nails, dung, ash, or food contaminated with them; upon being troubled by cats, etc.; upon hearing the abuse of creatures; upon hearing the barking of dogs; upon hearing the sound of fighting; upon hearing the sound of a pig; upon hearing the sound of someone crying due to pain; upon hearing the news of a fire in the village; upon hearing words like "So-and-so's head was cut off"; upon hearing the sound of creatures dying in battle, etc.; upon eating abandoned food; upon being overcome with sadness due to past suffering; upon fearing an urge to defecate; upon sneezing; upon vomiting; upon urinating; upon witnessing someone being killed; upon seeing or touching wet leather, bones, flesh, blood, pus, wine, or honey; upon seeing or touching burnt bones, hair, or leather; upon seeing or touching a menstruating or pregnant woman; upon seeing or touching a person with false beliefs or wearing dirty clothes; upon being touched by a cat, rat, dog, cow, horse, etc., or a young child; and upon finding live creatures in food that cannot be separated, or upon dead ants, etc., falling into food - one should abandon that food. Similarly, if one imagines that the food is flesh, dung, or blood, one should abandon it. || 186-193 ||

**194**

**Food to be Abandoned:**

One should abandon the consumption of alcohol, meat, honey, and the five Udumbara fruits. Abandoning these eight is called the eight fundamental virtues of the Shravakas. By abandoning them, one attains freedom from gross killing, i.e., gross violence. || 194 ||

**195**

A Shravaka who eats the green fruits of the Pipal, Udumbara (Gular), Plaksha, Vat, and Pilu trees commits violence against both subtle and gross living beings. And one who eats the dried fruits of these trees, in which the living beings have perished due to prolonged exposure, also commits violence due to their attachment.

**Meaning:**

Violence is of two types: one is material violence, and the other is mental violence. Killing external beings, whether one's own or others, is material violence; and destroying mental beings is mental violence. The arising of one's own passions like attachment and aversion, or causing anger, etc., in others, is also mental violence. Eating these fruits leads to both types of violence. It causes the death of the living beings residing in them, hence material violence. And the eater has intense attachment, hence mental violence. The nature of the soul is pure and crystal-clear, devoid of passions like attachment and aversion. 

Page #234:
---------------------------
## Trivarnika Achar:

...

In this, the arising of विकार-भाव (negative emotions) destroys the true nature of the soul. This destruction of the true nature is itself हिंसा (violence). There is a strong attachment to these dried fruits. Therefore, due to these attachments, he commits violence. || 195 ||

**Prohibition of Alcohol Consumption:**

Where the life of countless जीव (living beings) born from rasa (sap) are destroyed by drinking, and lust, anger, fear, delusion, and other vices arise, that is a sin. A person who abandons this intoxicant does not fall into calamity like the thief Dhurtli. But the drinker, like the ascetic Ekpad, indulges in wrong conduct like going where he shouldn't, eating what he shouldn't, and drinking what he shouldn't, and drowns in the ocean of samsara, going to hell. || 196 ||

**Meaning:** Drinking alcohol involves both द्रव्य-हिंसा (violence to matter) and भाव-हिंसा (violence to emotions). Those who drink alcohol suffer terrible consequences. Many direct faults are seen in this. || 196 ||

If, being greedy for the tongue, one does not understand द्रव्य-हिंसा (violence to matter) and भाव-हिंसा (violence to emotions), then let it be. But consider these faults that are directly seen. In this world, many shameless people, intoxicated by alcohol, consider their mothers, who gave birth to them, as their beloved, and engage in very disgraceful acts. This is not so surprising, because those who fall on the road after drinking alcohol, and lie with their mouths open in the middle of the road, have urine poured into their mouths by dogs, thinking it is a hole. They drink it with great relish, saying, "It is sweet, it is sweet." || 197 ||

**Meaning:** The point is that those who drink alcohol are eager to do the worst of deeds. They have no understanding of what is right and wrong. If those who do such disgusting acts are not considered low, and are considered worthy of sitting on the same line and eating from the same plate, then I don't know where the word "low" will be used! For the purpose of... 

Page #235:
---------------------------
## 196
**Somasen Bhattaraka's Composition**

They would like to call someone low, suppose that the other person also considers that thought to be good, he does not consider him low. Then it would have to be said that the word "low" is not a word at all. Well, let's say that someone has the idea that the distinction between low and high should be erased, then their thoughts are like someone's thought that the whole world should consume alcohol and meat. But just as there is no place in the hearts of noble, intelligent men for these thoughts, in the same way, there is no place in the hearts of experienced, thoughtful men for the idea of erasing the distinction between low and high. In short, drinking alcohol is a very disgusting act, and eating with drunkards is also a very disgusting act. || 197 ||

## 198
**Prohibition of Meat Consumption**

**Violence:** Even if it is from a creature that has died naturally, touching it for a moment is violence. 
Because cooked, uncooked, or being cooked, in such pieces of meat, there is always an infinite group of ordinary Nigoda creatures or Panchaindriya creatures of the same species, born and existing. || 198 ||

## 199
**Prohibition of Honey**

Honey is born from the destruction of countless bees, wasps, and other creatures. Besides, creatures are constantly being born in it. This honey is the excrement of those creatures. Therefore, it is a very impure substance. The saliva of the Mlechchas who extract it also falls into it, therefore it is very insignificant. Whoever consumes even a drop of this honey incurs a sin greater than burning seven villages. || 199 ||

## 200
**Prohibition of Butter**

Like honey, butter or ghee should also be renounced by the Shravakas. Because... 

Page #236:
---------------------------
## Trivarnika Achar...

**197.**
Even in butter, groups of beings are constantly generated after two muhurtas. Meaning: After two muhurtas of churning butter from curd, infinite beings are generated in it, and then until it is heated, infinite beings are constantly generated and die in it. Therefore, those who fear violence, the righteous, should never eat butter. || 20 ||

**Night-Food and Water-Drinking Prohibition.**
Because it is the cause of the killing of ragi-jiva, one should abandon it. || 201 ||
Righteous men should abandon eating at night, just as they abandon alcohol and meat. Because there is more attachment in eating at night than in eating during the day. Where there is attachment, there is surely violence. The killing of beings is many times greater in cooking and eating at night than during the day. Eating at night causes many diseases like dropsy. Similarly, one should not drink unfiltered water or use it in any other way. Water is a drink. Therefore, all thin substances like drinking oil, ghee, milk, etc., should be filtered before use. || 201 ||

**At the End of the Muhurta.**
Even if there is a wound, the use of mango, ghee, etc., is also contaminated. || 202 ||
A man who has abandoned night-food should eat only after two ghadi have passed after sunrise in the first muhurta of the day, and should eat only when two ghadi remain before sunset in the last muhurta of the day. And for the sake of curing illness, the use of fruits like mango, chironji, banana, cinnamon, etc., and ghee, milk, sugarcane juice, etc., is also contaminated. Meaning: A man who has abandoned night-food should not eat before two ghadi have passed after sunrise, and should not eat before two ghadi remain before sunset. Otherwise, there is a fault in the abandonment of night-food. || 202 ||

**For the Sake of Non-Violence.**
For the sake of protecting the beings and purifying the eight fundamental virtues, a courageous man who is steadfast and does not waver from the twenty-two parishahas and various kinds of afflictions, should abandon food, drink, chewable, and lickable - these four types of food - with mind, speech, and body, for the rest of his life (until death). || 203 ||

**Somasen Bhattaraka's composition**

Seeing the creatures in the water, etc., which are created by the water, etc., and which are thrown away as the remains of the dead, even if one eats them, he is surely happy. || 204 ||

Eating at night, if a worm comes in the food, it causes dropsy. If a spider comes in the food, it causes leprosy in the body. If a fly comes in the food, it causes vomiting. If a mosquito comes in the food, it harms the fat. If a scorpion falls in the food, it causes great pain in the palate. If a piece of wood or a thorn is eaten with food, it causes disease in the throat. If a hair mixed in the food gets stuck in the throat, it causes hoarseness. In this way, many defects arise from eating at night. Besides this, many subtle creatures fall into the food, which are not visible due to darkness, they also have to be eaten. At night, Pisachas, Rakshasas, etc., low-class Vyantar Devas roam around, their touch also happens to the food. That food is not fit for consumption. Such food, full of many defects, has to be eaten by those who eat at night. And whatever is abandoned, it also comes in the food at night because it is not visible. In this way, even though there are many defects in night food, it is surprising and regrettable that people of foolish minds consider themselves happy while eating at night. || 204 ||

**Defects of Jal-Galan-Vrat**

It is a defect of Jal-Galan-Vrat to not filter the water after two Muhurtas (four ghadi), or to filter it with a torn, dirty, old, small-holed cloth, or to put the remaining water (Jeevani) after filtering in a different reservoir than the one from which the water was taken. || 205 ||

**Meaning:** If someone has a rule to drink filtered water, and if he does not filter the water after four ghadi, does not filter it with a proper strainer, and does not put the Jeevani back in its place, then his Vrat is not commendable. || 205 ||

**Defects of Madya-Tyag-Vrat**

One should abandon all kinds of Achar, curd and buttermilk after two days and nights, and Kanji which has white flowers on it or is more than two days and nights old. If they do not abandon these, then their Madya-Tyag-Vrat will be considered flawed. || 206 ||

## Trivarna Achar...

**Faults of the Meat-Renunciation Vow.** Water, ghee, oil, etc., kept in leather containers, asafoetida covered or tied in leather, and all kinds of food items whose taste has been spoiled, eating all these is a transgression of the meat-renunciation vow. ||207||
**Faults of the Honey-Renunciation Vow.** For the purity of their honey-renunciation vow, those who have renounced honey should generally not eat flowers of any kind. And they should not use honey, meat, or alcohol in things like enemas, offerings of food, eye-ointments, etc. Meaning: The word "generally" in the verse indicates that there is no absolute prohibition on eating Mahua, Bhilawa, etc., flowers that can be purified, and dried flowers like saffron. ||207||
**Faults of the Five Udumbar-Renunciation Vow.** Those who have renounced the five Udumbar fruits should not eat fruits of any kind that are unknown, cucumbers, jujubes, areca nuts, etc., and peas, etc., without splitting them open and purifying their inner parts. ||209||
These verses above describe the transgressions of the eight fundamental virtues. Here, only their brief meaning is given. If there is a need to see the details, one should refer to the Sanskrit commentary and its language commentary of the Sagara Dharma Amrita.
**Other Things to be Abandoned.** All beings with infinite bodies are always to be shunned by the compassionate. ... For even if one kills one, one kills infinite beings. ||210|| ... All the things mentioned above, and similarly other things, are infinite-bodied. In them, infinite beings reside at all times. Therefore, compassionate people should always avoid these infinite-bodied things... 

Page #239:
---------------------------
## 200
One should renounce the killing of living beings. Whoever is inclined to kill even one of them, destroys countless living beings. || 210 || ...
One should avoid Nali, Sarana, Kalin, Drona, Pushpa, etc.
The fruit of eating these is little, and the killing of many living beings is great. || 211 ||
One should renounce for life, the stalk of the lotus, the root of the Suran, the Tarbooz (Kalingad), Drona Pushpa, radish, ginger, neem flower, Ketaki flower, etc. Because the fruit of eating these is little, and the killing of many living beings is great. || 211 ||
One should avoid Mung, Urad, Chana, etc., which can be divided into two equal parts, called Dvidal. One should not eat Mung, Urad, Chana, etc., mixed with raw milk, raw curd, and buttermilk made from raw milk, because countless living beings reside in them. This is heard in the Agam. Similarly, one should not eat old Dvidal. The meaning of the word "Praayash" is that if Dvidal grains like Kulith, etc., have become black due to being kept for a long time, but no Sammoorshan Jivas are present in them, then there is no fault in eating them. Also, one should not eat Dvidal grains that have not been ground in a mill during the rainy season, because their dal has not been made. Because Ayurveda says that sprouts are born in these grains during the rainy season, and Sammoorshan Trasajivas are also born. This also implies that one should not eat those Dvidal grains in which sprouts have not grown during the rainy season, and one should not eat leafy vegetables during the rainy season, because many Bas-Sthavar Jivas are found in such vegetables during the rainy season. The fruit of eating these is also very little. || 212 || ...
The method of silence while eating. To protect pride and knowledge, humility is necessary.
Therefore, one should eat in silence, not by gestures of the hand, etc. || 213 ||
By maintaining silence, I will not ask for anything while eating - this way, the pride of the Aayachkatva-vrat is protected, and the humility of Shruta-gyan is achieved. Therefore, one should eat in silence. One should not ask for any food by gestures of the hand, etc. || 213 ||

## Trivarnika Conduct

**NAAMKAM**

**Food-Measure:** One should eat to their full capacity, free from shame and fear. One should not be excessively greedy in eating or accumulating wealth. || 214 ||

**Meaning:** When sitting down to eat, one should eat to their full capacity. While eating, one should not feel any shame or fear, nor should one eat excessively. Eating too much leads to sluggishness and excessive sleep. Therefore, one should always eat in moderation. || 214 ||

**Actions to be performed after eating:** After eating to their full capacity, one should drink some cool water to aid digestion. Then, one should cleanse their mouth with water and wash their hands thoroughly. || 215 ||

**Then, returning to the courtyard, one should brush their teeth with a stick. After that, one should wash their hands and feet with water and cleanse themselves. || 216 ||

**Food not suitable for consumption:** One should not eat food offered as a sacrifice, food related to the *choul* ceremony, food related to the *simanta* ceremony, food related to the *garbhadan* ceremony, food related to the monthly *shraddha* ceremony, or food during times of hardship. || 217 ||

**The best householder should not eat food prepared for many people, nor should they eat food belonging to a prostitute, an unrighteous person, an ascetic, or a *shudra*. || 218 ||

**One should not eat food offered on the eleventh day after a person's death, food offered during the fortnightly *shraddha*, food offered during the *sapinda* ceremony, or food offered during a *prayashchitta* ceremony. If one has already eaten such food, they should perform *japa*. || 219 ||

**220.** If even one person in a row of Jain practitioners leaves their plate and gets up, the remaining practitioners should not eat.

**221.**  Whoever leaves their plate first among those eating in a row is a fool and becomes an object of ridicule. Everyone laughs at him.

**222.**  There is no fault in the row if there is an obstruction of fire, ashes, darbha grass, or water between the people eating, or at the entrance.  Meaning: If any of these things obstruct, there is no fault in getting up from the row.

**223.** If people sitting in a row touch each other, they should eat the food without hesitation and after eating, they should recite 108 japa.

**224.**  First, take a little food from your plate and set it aside for your friend, etc. Then eat the remaining food yourself. This is the proper way to eat.

**225.**  The person who leaves their plate empty after eating or drinking will suffer from hunger and thirst in every birth.

**226.**  Whoever leaves half of their mouthwash on the ground will experience an increase in diseases in their body. 

Page #242:
---------------------------
## The Trivarnika (203)

A person who complains while holding a cup of water should drink half of it and pour the other half on the ground. By doing so, diseases will never afflict his body. || 226 ||

Even if a householder rises from his seat after eating without rinsing his mouth, he should immediately bathe; otherwise, he will become impure. In essence, one should always rinse their mouth after eating. || 227 ||

After eating, one should discard the clothes worn while eating and wear another garment. For purifying the mouth, one should consume betel nut and leaves. || 228 ||

One should always chew betel nut after eating with reverence. There is no fault in chewing betel nut after applying oil and bathing, during auspicious occasions, and even at night. This practice is for the Paakshik Shravak. || 229 ||

## The Method of Chewing Betel Nut

In the morning, the betel nut should be dominant, in the afternoon, the lime should be dominant, and at night, the leaves should be dominant. The person who consumes betel nut in this order will be fortunate. || 230 ||

Eating the base of the betel leaf leads to disease, the tip leads to sin, chewing it with lime reduces lifespan, and chewing the stem destroys intelligence. || 231 ||

Therefore, one should discard the base, tip, and stem of the betel leaf and chew it with lime. Chewing betel nut in this way increases lifespan, wealth, and fame. || 232 ||

**234.** Some say that one should give five, seven, eight, ten or twelve betel leaves to others and take the same number for oneself. **234.**

It is an ornament for the mouth, a purifier, and a stimulant of the fire of desire. O friend! Betel nut has thirteen qualities. Even in heaven, these are difficult to obtain. **237.**

**238.** Do not eat betel nut during the period of mourning for the dead, on the day of the shraddha ceremony for one's parents, and on the day of fasting, both day and night. **238.**

A woman should sweep the house with a soft and fine broom like a cloth, so that no creatures like ants are harmed while moving around. ||6||
She should collect the dust and dirt that comes out while sweeping the house and spread it in a shady place with compassion. ||7||
Householders should plaster the floor with fresh cow dung and water, or with soil and water, or with just water, and take care that no creatures are harmed. ||8||
Householders should store cow dung and dry it in the sun. They should collect dry, creature-free fuelwood. Meaning: This is the Trivarnachar Granth. It describes the duties of all men, big and small, of all three classes. People of high status should not despise these tasks.

##  A Cloth for Filtering Water

A cloth that is torn, old, small, thin, and full of holes should not be used by women to filter water. (13)

The mouth of the pot should be covered with a suitable cloth and the water should be filtered slowly, so that the water does not splash out of the pot. (14)

The remaining water should be poured back into the water source. When you return home from the water source, filter the water again. (15)

Filter the water again after every two *muhurtas*. In the morning, filter the water and pour the remaining water back into the water source. (16)

Filtered water remains *prasook* (free of living organisms) for two *muhurtas*. Water that has been made *prasook* by adding cardamom, cloves, etc., remains *prasook* for two *praharas*. Hot water remains *prasook* for a whole day and night. Any other water is like unfiltered water. (16-17)

Make the water fragrant with the flowers of *patali* (a type of flower), the roots of *ausheerak* (a type of grass), cardamom, camphor, sandalwood, and other good things. (18)

There are so many living beings in a single drop of water that if they were the size of pigeons and flew, they would fill the entire Jambudvipa (a mythical island). (19)

A new, strong cloth should be used by the Shravaka for filtering water. || 20 || 

(Note: Almost all the verses in this text are collected, so one should not focus on repetition.)

A cloth that is very fine, very expensive, very thick, and makes it difficult to filter water, leads to poverty when used for filtering water. || 21 ||

Wheat and other grains should be cleaned and then ground in a clean mill with care, so as not to harm any living beings. || 22 ||

Grain that is infested with insects, old, and has changed color and taste should not be ground, pounded, or given to monks. || 23 ||

Grain that is infested with insects should not be spread out in the sun, on the road, or washed with water, because it leads to the killing of living beings. || 24 ||

Grain should not be stored for a long time, because living beings are born in it when stored for a long time. || 25 ||

Living beings are born very quickly in rice, flour, and split pulses. Therefore, it is considered wise to use them quickly and not store them for a long time. || 26 ||

A Kshatriya should educate his sons, grandsons, and daughters in worldly conduct and behavior. He should arrange their marriages according to his ability. He should keep his cows, horses, buffaloes, etc., in their respective places and perform the Sandhyavandana in the evening as before. || 42-43 ||

I will briefly explain the duties of Kshatriyas, listen carefully.

A Kshatriya who is a servant should go to the royal palace in the morning, armed with weapons. After bowing to the king seated in the assembly, he should stand before him with folded hands, filled with devotion to his master, and with great joy. He should then sit down comfortably in his designated place according to the king's command. He should sacrifice his life for his master, for the purpose of a servant is to serve his master.

When the king commands, "Do this," he should do it quickly and with utmost effort, so that his master is pleased with him. A servant who is a traitor to his master, ungrateful, treacherous, a killer of animals, cruel, and a slanderer will go to hell after death.

He should go quickly wherever the king commands him to go. He should perform Sandhyavandana, Samayika, offering food to the needy, and austerity. || 44-49 ||

After performing the worship of the gods as described earlier, the king should come and sit comfortably in the assembly, on the lion throne. He should protect all beings with justice and fairness. Without subjects, what is a king?

He should punish the wicked and protect the righteous. He should perform acts of bowing down to the Jinas and the Munis. || 50-52 ||

**107.** One should not accept a false weight, and should avoid false writing. One should avoid deceit, and the causes of cruelty, anger, and greed.

**107.** **(Commentary)** A Vaiśya should not accept a bribe, nor should he accept anything from anyone out of favor. Because by accepting a bribe, the results of his actions will be directed towards the giver of the bribe, which will make it impossible for his actions to be performed properly. A Vaiśya should not write false accounts, promissory notes, etc., nor should he engage in deceit or fraud. He should not desire to acquire things that are not his, nor should he be cruel in his dealings, and he should not be excessively attached to or greedy for anything.

**108.** One should employ servants, and give them good oxen, good seeds for sowing, and other useful materials, and have them cultivate the land.

**109.** A Vaiśya who observes vows, performs daily and occasional rituals, performs daily meditation, and practices austerities such as fasting, should not engage in agriculture. Because in agriculture, many living beings are killed.

**110-111.** A Vaiśya should purchase cows, buffaloes, horses, etc., and then distribute the milk, yogurt, ghee, and buttermilk to worthy recipients. There is no fault in a merchant selling ghee. But he should not sell the remaining milk, yogurt, etc., and should ensure that his animals are well-fed with grass, etc., and not allowed to go hungry.

**112.** A Vaiśya should engage in trade to support his family. There are three types of trade: first, running a shop; second, transporting goods by ox-cart, etc., to other places and selling them, and bringing goods from other places and selling them here; and third, transporting goods by ship, etc., to other islands and bringing goods from there.

**113.** When measuring cloth, one should use a standard yard, and avoid any excess or deficiency. One should sell cloth with a small profit.

**Verse 114:**
In the rainy season, there is a possibility of the birth of living beings in fine clothes. Therefore, for the sake of Dharma, Shravakas should constantly clean such clothes by shaking and wiping them.

**Verse 115:**
Do not sell woolen, leather, unbleached (1) Kosa, and clothes stained with the residue of inferior houses, rice flour, etc.

**Verse 116:**
The trade of (?) thread, Patta Sutra (silk), and cotton is not considered virtuous. Shravakas should not engage in the trade of Patta Sutra eggs and Kosa eggs.

**Verse 117:**
Shravakas should engage in the trade of gold, silver, gems, and pearls. However, they should not deceive by applying a coating or polish to inferior items and selling them as pure.

Do not excite them about their work. And do not ask anyone to do work like turning a wheel, grinding, burning ashes, breaking stones, etc. || 132 ||
It is proper to do business with Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Touchable Shudras. . .
Doing business with the low will bring lowliness upon oneself. || 133 ||
The weaver, the gardener, the brass-smith, the goldsmith, the blacksmith, the mason, the needle-maker, the Hindu weaver, the potter, the dyer, the family man, the seller of fried food, the oilman, the betel-leaf seller, the barber, etc. are considered Touchable Shudras. || 134-135 ||
The wise man should do business after seeing what is proper and what is improper. . .
A man should carry a bull for the purpose of going to a distant country. || 136 ||
The wise man should load it with a light load and drive it slowly. . .
He should fill it with food and water until it is satisfied. || 137 ||
If swelling, etc. occurs on its back, he should kindly treat it. . .

## Trivarna Achar

For business, if one travels to other islands by boat, they should protect their pure conduct for the sake of Dharma. If by chance, due to fate, one faces the possibility of drowning in the sea, they should remember the Jinadeva. || 139 ||

The duties of the Vaishyas are briefly explained according to the Agamas. The Shudras are considered servants of the Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas. || 140 ||

Various types of crafts and work are specifically mentioned for the Shudras. They should perform their own duties while protecting the welfare of living beings. || 141 ||

The Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras are described based on their specific actions. All of them are devoted to following Jain Dharma, therefore they are all like brothers. Everyone should remain equanimous in profit and loss. One should not be overly greedy in business, as wealth is obtained according to one's destiny. || 142-143 ||

One who is constantly engaged in endeavors, free from laziness, and dedicated to righteous conduct, will acquire millions of rupees. || 144 ||

Laziness in good business and Dharma is not conducive to happiness. Diligence is like a harsh-spoken enemy, but a friend. Laziness is like a sweet-talking friend, but an enemy. Although diligence may bring many difficulties, it ultimately acts like a friend, helping one. Although laziness, or lying down and sleeping, may provide comfort to the body, it is not true comfort. In reality, it is a burden and brings suffering. || 145 || 

Page #265:
---------------------------
## English Translation:

**226**

**146.** When experiencing any kind of pain, a strange yawn, a sneeze at the beginning of a good deed, stumbling or falling while getting up from sleep, one should remember the Jina.

**147-148.** One should not speak words that others will not believe, praise oneself, criticize others, or speak words that cause strife. One should not speak words that cause harm, mental anguish, domestic misconduct, or words of honor and dishonor in the presence of wise people.

**149-150.** One should always be equanimous in prosperity and adversity, speak words that are brief, timely, and beneficial to all, always abide by righteousness, never entertain thoughts of stealing, and never reveal the secrets of one's own or another's enemy.

**151-152.** One should constantly cultivate detachment, speak words of Dharma, understand the opinions of the people and act accordingly, be friendly to all beings, rejoice in the virtues of the virtuous, be indifferent to both the virtuous and the wicked, and visit another's house only for a specific purpose, never for idle reasons.

**153.** One should never speak words that cause violence or sin, nor should one listen to such scriptures. One should never think of harming anyone.

**Neww9.**

If a dispute arises with someone in the practical matters written by Somasen Bhattaraka, one should not harbor any ill will in their heart, not laugh without purpose, not repeatedly touch their face with their hands, and not repeatedly put their finger in their nose. || 161 ||

One should speak firmly after considering the matter carefully, and speak words that do not cause anger in the hearts of others. One should not pluck grass or anything else without purpose, and should not click their fingers or play any instrument on their body without purpose. || 162 ||

One should not speak privately with their mother, daughter, or sister. One should be careful while sitting, sleeping, standing, and riding. || 163 ||

One should personally look after their livestock, such as cows, buffaloes, bulls, and horses. They should have their farming done near their own home. They should keep the elderly, children, the weak, and the disabled happy. || 164 ||

One should not cross the shadow of a statue of a Jina or any other revered object, nor should they allow their body to be touched by the shadow of a low person. || 165 ||

## Trivarnika Achar

**169-170** Do not trust animals that strike with their claws, rivers, horned animals, men who carry weapons, women, kings, thieves, adulterers, wicked people, slanderers, greedy people, drunkards, deceivers, and sinners.

**171** Do not walk through the midst of revered people. Do not ask questions without a purpose. If you have come from a foreign country, bathe and purify yourself before entering your home.

**172** At the beginning of a scripture or any other work, say "Om Namah Siddham" with humility.

**173** While enjoying worldly pleasures, keep your mind on the pleasures of the afterlife. Just as a child drinks from one breast of his mother while holding the other with his hand, so too should humans keep their minds on both worldly and otherworldly pleasures.

**174** While following worldly conduct, do not forget your Dharma. Perform Sandhyavandana and light a lamp in your home in the evening.

**175** From sunset to sunrise, if a lamp burns in a house, poverty will never enter it.

**176** A lamp facing east increases lifespan, facing north increases wealth, facing west brings sorrow, and facing south brings loss.

Composed by Somasen Bhattaraka -
If lamps are established in all four directions, then there is no fault. || 177 ||
May it be auspicious.
*********
Placing lamps facing the four directions is auspicious. There is no fault in what has been said before. || 177 ||
Thus, the *Trivarnajanita* (born of the three varnas) *Vyaparalaksmyagamo* (the treatise on the acquisition of wealth through business) has been described.
Those who perform this *Trivarna* conduct, possessing the qualities of the best of men, are seekers of the three goals (Dharma, Artha, Kama). They enjoy the best pleasures in this life and attain supreme happiness in the next life. Finally, conquering the enemy of karma, they attain the imperishable, pure, and liberated state. || 178 ||
This chapter, marked by the characteristics of the three varnas, is the abode of skill and art. It is the seventh chapter, in the form of business, which is dear to me, Somasen Muni. || 179 ||

## Garbhaadhan Kriya
A woman in her menstrual cycle should stay in a secluded place for four days, holding a jasmine or similar vine in her hand. || 9 ||
On the fourth day, she should be bathed with panchgavya and anointed with turmeric and other auspicious substances and fragrances. || 10 ||
The first menstruating woman in the household becomes the subject of this ritual. Three kunds should be constructed in a separate area from the Brahma-sthana. || 11 ||
The householder Acharya should worship the image placed on the platform, as before, adorned with three chakras, three umbrellas, and accompanied by Yakshas and Yakshis. || 12 ||
Then, in front of the kunda, two platforms should be constructed, each one hand-span wide and square, and beautiful. || 13 ||
On these, an Agni Mandala should be drawn with five colors, with eight lotus petals in each of the eight directions, and a central karnika. || 14 ||
On the fourth day, the husband, having bathed well, should place his wife there. The ritual is performed by elderly women, adorned with garlands. || 15 ||
The ground should be covered with earth and sprinkled with night-blooming jasmine and rice grains. On these, a swastika symbol should be drawn. || 16 ||
A pot with leaves, adorned with garlands and threads, should be placed there, filled with urine, for auspiciousness. || 17 || 

Page #272:

## Trivarnika Achar:

**233:**

On the fourth day, elderly, virtuous women should bathe the couple. Then, they should adorn them with ornaments and clothes, and seat them on decorated platforms, performing all the rituals. In front of them, they should spread a layer of mud, and draw a swastika symbol with turmeric and rice. On this, they should ceremoniously install a kalash (pot) for auspiciousness. The mouth of the kalash should be decorated with five leaves, garlands, cloth, and threads. || 15-17 ||

The Acharya, holding the kalash, should bless the couple with auspicious words, wishing them prosperity and good fortune. He should then sprinkle them with water from the kalash. || 18 ||

After this, they should make the couple circumambulate the fire thrice, and then seat them again. Virtuous women should apply kumkum tilak to them. They should perform aarti, and shower them with water and akshat, saying, "May you prosper and flourish." On this occasion, the women should honor them with clothes, betel nut, ornaments, etc., according to their means, giving gifts to the couple and making them happy. || 19-20 ||

"May your lineage prosper through you, O bride and groom!" They should bless them with such words, and then send them home with joy. || 21 ||

Then, they should feed all their relatives, and honor them with fragrant offerings, betel nut, clothes, and ornaments, with great love. || 22 ||

**30**

This ritual should be performed for the first time in the house. It leads to the growth of righteous offspring, and is solely for the sake of Dharma. || 23 ||

When a woman first menstruates, the above-mentioned rituals should be performed in full. This leads to the growth of righteous offspring. || 23 ||

In one's own house, one should face east while sleeping. In a father-in-law's house, one should face south. While traveling, one should face west. Never face north. || 24 ||

##  Translation:

**238**

A man who does not approach his wife when she is menstruating, sinks into the terrible sin of abortion along with his parents. **Meaning:** Many people object to this. The reason is that they are intoxicated by the idea of self-rule these days. Therefore, in their zeal to give equality to everyone, they incite those who oppose this practice and seek fame and worship. They have made it their primary duty to attack religious subjects. || 49 ||

**A woman who does not approach her husband during menstruation becomes a dog, a sheep, a deer, a jackal, a sow, and a donkey after death.** || 50 ||

**They call the method of conception described above the "Kama Yajna" for householders. By this method, the father obtains a son who will deliver him from the ocean of worldly existence.** || 51 ||

**The "Moda Kriya" (celebration):** When the fetus is firmly established, on the third month, the second ritual, the "Moda Kriya" (celebration), should be performed with great joy. || 52 ||

**The "Garbha Sanskar" (fetal ritual) should be performed in the third month, along with the "Pumsavana" (ritual for a male child). If the pregnancy is not known in the first month, the "Garbha Sanskar" should be performed in the third month. This ritual is associated with the male sign.** || 53 ||

**First, the pregnant woman should be massaged with oil and bathed with water. She should be adorned with fine clothes and given a fruit in her hand. Apply sandalwood, saffron, etc., to her body. Then, perform all the rituals like the previous ones, starting with the worship of the Jinas and the Homa.** || 54-55 ||

##  Chapter 240: 

**Verse 64:** A man who desires good fortune should perform the **Pumsavana** ceremony in the fifth month of pregnancy to nourish the fetus. He should bathe with pure water, wear clean clothes, and perform the ceremony with respect, following the instructions of the **Acharya**.

**Verse 65:** He should perform **Jina Puja** and **Homa** at home as before. The **Acharya**, accompanied by the elders of the family, should guide the pregnant woman.

**Verse 66:** The **Acharya** should bathe the pregnant woman and adorn her with clothes and ornaments. He should apply sandalwood paste and other auspicious substances.

**Verse 67:** The pregnant woman, with a tilak on her forehead and kajal in her eyes, should be seated on a wooden platform covered with a red cloth, in front of the **Jina**.

**Verse 68:** The **Acharya** should sprinkle her with holy water and chant mantras. The husband should place sesame seeds and betel leaves in her hands.

**Verse 69:** The husband should make a garland of barley sprouts, flowers, tender leaves, and darbha grass and place it around her neck according to the prescribed ritual.

**Verse 70:** The **Acharya** should offer **Purnāhuti** to the **Yakshas** and **Yakshis** and recite a **Shantipath**. The householder should honor the Brahmanas present with betel nuts, fruits, clothes, and other gifts.

**Mantras:**

* **Verse 69:**  "Om Jham Van Ivin Kshvim Ham Sah Kantagale Yavamala Kshipami Jhau Swaha." (The husband should chant this mantra while placing the garland around his wife's neck.)

* **Verse 70:** "Om Jham Van Vhah Pah Hah A Si A U Sa Kantapuratah Payas Dadhyodana Haridra Ambukalashan Stapayami Swaha." (The husband should chant this mantra while placing a pot of milk, a pot of yogurt rice, a pot of turmeric water, and a pot of water in front of his wife. The wife should touch each pot with her finger. Touching the milk pot signifies the birth of a son, touching the yogurt rice pot signifies the birth of a daughter, and touching the turmeric water pot signifies the birth of both a son and a daughter.)

**Trivarnikaachar:** This mantra is recited while placing three kalashas (pots) filled with milk, curd, rice, and turmeric water in front of the pregnant woman. A young girl is then asked to touch the kalashas. If she touches the kalash filled with milk, it signifies the birth of a son. If she touches the kalash filled with curd and rice, it signifies the birth of a daughter. And if she touches the kalash filled with turmeric water, it signifies the non-arrival of either a son or a daughter, meaning either the child will be born infertile, or the pregnancy will be terminated, or the child will die after birth.

**From this day onwards, the family should play musical instruments, sing songs, have dancers perform, and give charity every day.**

**Seemant Kriya:** The Seemant ceremony is performed in the seventh month of pregnancy. The parting of the hair on the pregnant woman's head is called Seemant. This ceremony should be performed on an auspicious day, in an auspicious constellation, on an auspicious day of the week, in an auspicious yoga, in an auspicious lagna, and in an auspicious muhurta.

**After bathing and adorning the beautiful pregnant woman with clothes and ornaments, the husband should seat her on a separate seat facing east and perform the homa (fire ritual) as before. Elderly women of the same caste and lineage should then part the pregnant woman's hair three times.**

**The instrument used for parting the hair should be made of Khadira wood, smeared with ghee, and adorned with two bunches of fruits and three blades of grass. Alternatively, it can be made of Sami wood, with a white handle and three sections, or it can be a Shalaka (a wooden stick).**

**The pregnant woman should then be adorned with oil and vermillion, and white and Udumbara (fig) powder should be sprinkled on her head and stomach. The Guru should place a garland made of Udumbara flowers around the neck of the pregnant woman. He should also offer her sweets and other things as before.**

The means to perform the Mang ceremony are: Dip a Khadira (Catechu) twig, with two small branches bearing fruits and three Darbha grass blades, in ghee. Or, perform the Mang ceremony with a Sami (Prosopis) twig. The tip of the twig should be budding and have three white spots like feathers. Apply vermillion mixed with oil to the part of the body where the Mang ceremony is performed. After the Mang ceremony, the husband should sprinkle Udumbara (Ficus glomerata) fruit on the wife's stomach and head. The Acharya should make a garland of Udumbara fruits and place it around the pregnant woman's neck. All other rituals should be performed as before. || 76-79 ||

The Acharya should perform the Punyavachana ceremony for the pregnant woman.
**Meaning:** The Acharya should bless the pregnant woman by performing the Punyavachana ceremony.

**Mantra:** Om Hrim Shrim Hrim Krim A Si Ja Usa Udumbarakritachurna Samaste Jathare Cheyam Vim Kshvim Swaha.
**Meaning:** Using this mantra, sprinkle Udumbara powder on the stomach or head.

**Mantra:** Om Namo'rhathe Bhagavate Udumbarafalabharanan Bahuputra Bhavitumhi Swaha.
**Meaning:** Reciting this mantra, the husband should place a garland of Udumbara fruits around the pregnant woman's neck.

**Special Note:** Garbhadan, Pramod, Simanta, and Punsavan should be performed in the ninth month if the husband is poor. || 80 ||

**Somaseṇabhaṭṭāraka** composed:

**92.**  "Affection for the noble is called *prīti*, affection for the son is called *suprīti*, and great enthusiasm is generated in the gods (*prīyodbhava*). After the birth of a son, perform *prīti*, *suprīti*, and *prīyodbhava* actions with great enthusiasm. Affection for the noble is called *prīti*. Affection for the son is called *suprīti*. And generating enthusiasm in the gods is called *prīyodbhava*."

**93.** "When the son is born, the father should perform *ācamana* with joy. After performing *prāṇāyāma*, he should perform *ācamana* again."

**94.** "Then, taking the articles of worship and the auspicious pot, he should go to the Jina temple with the sound of great music."

**95.** "Then, having crossed over, he should engage virtuous Brahmins in the Jina temple. Every day, he should engage them for worship until the umbilical cord is cut."

**96.** "The father should satisfy all the Bhattas, the monks, and others with gifts. He should also satisfy all his family members with clothes, ornaments, and betel."

**97.** "Looking at the son's face, he should mix milk, ghee, and sugar in a vessel and feed the child five times with a golden spoon or other golden utensil."

**98.** "This same action should be performed for the daughter, only the chanting of mantras should be omitted, and only the action should be performed. After this, the umbilical cord should be wrapped in a *brahmasūtra* (sacred thread) and cut."

**99.** "Then, the father should joyfully place the umbilical cord in a pure place, along with gems, pearls, and other valuables, in the ground."

**100.** "After giving birth, the woman should stay in her room and apply a mixture of pure earth and cow dung to the area where the child was born, for a length of four fingers."

## Trivarnika Conduct

**102.**  One should wash the clothes, ornaments, bed, food vessels, and utensils of the mother and child with pure water and soap according to the prescribed method.

**103.** On the fifth or sixth day after birth, at midnight, one should offer a sacrifice to the eight guardians of the directions with music, instruments, and weapons.

**104.** After performing a night vigil with lamps and peace chants, one should mark the doorway with vermillion and kohl. In the house, one should apply a layer of mud four fingers thick, mixed with mud and cow dung. One should bathe the mother and child with warm water containing five types of herbs. This bath should be performed for purification three times a day for ten days after delivery. The mother's clothes, ornaments, bed, food vessels, etc., should be washed and cleaned with pure water and mud according to the prescribed method. Items that need to be washed by a washerman should be given to him.

## Jananashocha (Birth Impurity)

**105.** The period of birth impurity for Brahmanas is ten days, for Kshatriyas twelve days, and for Vaishyas fourteen days. This means that for ten days after the birth of a son or daughter, Brahmanas are considered impure, for twelve days Kshatriyas, and for fourteen days Vaishyas.

**106.** A monk should not go to the house of a woman who has given birth for one month, and should not go to the houses of her relatives for ten days.

**Somasebhaṭṭāraka composed:**

Utensils made of clay that were used before should be discarded. Metal utensils and clothes should be purified by washing. (109)

**Namakarma (Naming Ceremony) Ritual:**

On the twelfth, sixteenth, twentieth, or thirty-second day, one should perform the Namakarma ritual according to one's family tradition. (111)

Some say that if the Namakarma ritual is not performed on the thirty-second day, it should be performed when the child turns one year old. (112)

On an auspicious day, one should perform homa and worship of the Jina in the Jain temple or at home with devotion and play musical instruments. (113)

The couple and their child should be seated on a good platform, adorned with clothes and ornaments. The householder's teacher should sprinkle them with auspicious words. (114)

In the case of the birth of a son, during the Annaprashan (first feeding) ceremony, the wife and son should be seated on the right side of the father. (115)

**116** At the time of Garbhaadhan (conception), Pumsavana (ceremony for male offspring), Seemantaonayana (ceremony for pregnant woman), Vadhupravesha (bride's entry), Shudraapunarvivahamandana (remarriage of Shudra woman),

**117**  and at the time of worship of the family deity and Kanyadaan (giving away of daughter in marriage), the wife should be seated on the right side.

**118** At the time of son's marriage, daughter's marriage, Munidaan (gift to a monk), Archana (worship), Ashirvaadagrahana (receiving blessings), Abhisheka (consecration), Pratiṣṭhādi Mahotsava (grand festival), and at the time of auspicious moments for digging a well, pond, lake, garden, and for Shantikarma (peace-making ceremony) and Pouṣṭikakarma (nourishing ceremony), the wife should be seated on the left side.

**Meaning:**

In verse 117, the phrase "Shudraapunarvivahamandana" appears. This might lead one to believe that this text allows for remarriage. However, this is not correct. There are two types of Shudras: Sachchudra and Asachchudra, or Bhojya Shudra and Abhojya Shudra. The Sachchudras, who only marry once and do not practice remarriage (Dhareja), are considered pure.

**Somaneeti** states: "Sachchudras are those who practice only one marriage."

Conversely, those who practice Dhareja are Asachchudras. Those whose food and drink are consumed by Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras are Bhojya Shudras. The Abhojya Shudras are the opposite.

**Nandi Guru** states: "Bhojya are those whose food and drink are consumed by Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras. Abhojya are those who are the opposite."

Therefore, it can be concluded that Sachchudras are considered pure and Bhojya. The reason for this is that they do not practice remarriage. Since even among Shudras, widow remarriage is not generally encouraged, it is completely wrong to say that the author of this text is advocating for widow remarriage by using the phrase "Shudraapunarvivahamandana."

The truth is that this text primarily describes the conduct of Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas. The conduct of both types of Shudras is mentioned occasionally and in a secondary manner. Asachchudras practice remarriage (Dhareja), and therefore, this practice is mentioned in the context of their conduct. This does not prove that widow remarriage is allowed.

Widow remarriage is against the scriptures. There is no mention of widow remarriage in the scriptures. This is not only true for Jain scriptures but also for the scriptures of the Brahmanical tradition. Manu states: "Na vivaha vidhayuktam vishavaavedanam punah," meaning that widow remarriage is not mentioned in the marriage rituals. 

Page #287:

## 248

Somasen Bhattaraka's work states that even external people who are not Jains condemn it, and a Jain Ṛṣi would never endorse it. It is well-known that in marriage rituals, only the marriage of a virgin is prescribed, not the marriage of a widow. In fact, widow marriage is condemned. In the 44th chapter of the Adi Purana, the son of the Chakravarti Bharat, Arkkirti Maharaj, expresses his disgust towards a widow in these words:

"I do not want Sulochana, because the life of this greedy Jayakumar is about to be extinguished by my arrows, so what use do I have for that widow Sulochana?"

The Padma Purana also prohibits widow marriage. When Kharadushan abducted Shurpankha and fled, King Ravana decided to fight him. At that time, Mandodari, the queen, said to King Ravana:

"Even if you somehow kill Kharadushan in battle, she is still tainted by the abduction of a virgin, and she is no longer fit to be given to another. Therefore, she will only be called a widow after Kharadushan's death."

The Maha Purana and the Padma Purana are both considered authoritative texts by Jains. Their authority is deeply ingrained in the very essence of Jainism. Therefore, it is clear from these two authoritative texts that widow marriage is a reprehensible act and goes against the scriptures. The author Somasen Maharaj's views are also in line with the scriptures. His conclusions are not swayed in the slightest towards widow marriage. The author has mentioned only two paths for a widow in the 13th chapter: one is to take Jain initiation and the other is to take the vow of widowhood. He has not mentioned a third path called widow marriage. Therefore, it is clear that the author's intention is not in favor of widow marriage. He considers widow marriage to be a reprehensible act, otherwise, he would have mentioned a third path called widow marriage along with the two mentioned paths. The interpretation of widow marriage from some verses in the 11th chapter is also incorrect, and we will clarify those verses as well. The point is that the author's intention cannot be interpreted as supporting widow marriage based on this verse or any other verses and passages.

## 115-119

On a flawless, unblemished plate, the father should place the child's head. He should write his own name and the child's birth name there.

    * This prayer is repeated three times with the assistance of Brahmins.
    * The chosen name is then proclaimed loudly, and the Jain deity is worshipped.
    * The Yaksas are offered a "pūrṇārpa" (full offering).

2. **Ear Piercing:**
    * On the same day, in the evening, the child's ears are pierced.
    * The child is then placed in a cradle for the night.

3. **Mantras:**
    * The following mantra is recited during the naming ceremony: "Om hīṁ śrīṁ klīṁ arha vālakasya nāmakaraṇam karomi. Abhinandanānāmnā āyurārogyavāryavān bhava bhava. Aṣṭottarasahasrābhidhānā bhava bhava jhauṁ lauṁ asi ā u sā svāhā." (This mantra is used for the naming ceremony. The child's name is added after "Abhinandanānāmnā").
    * The following mantra is recited during the ear piercing: "Om hīṁ śrīṁ ai vālakasya haḥ karṇanāsāvedhanaṁ karomi a si ā u sā svāhā."
    * The following mantra is recited when placing the child in the cradle: "Om hīṁ ślauṁ jhauṁ śvī kṣvī āndolaṁ vālakam āropayāmi tasya sarvarakṣā bhavatu sau jhauṁ svāhā."

4. **First Outing:**
    * The child's first outing from the house is scheduled for the fourth month after birth.
    * The child is taken to see the sun on the third or first day of the bright fortnight.
    * The child is bathed, adorned with ornaments, and sprinkled with water containing kusha grass while reciting auspicious words.

The method of sitting in Padmasana is as follows: the child's face should be towards the east, the left leg should be below and the right leg above, and the hands should be placed on the upper part of the legs. After seating him in this way, perform his aarti and let the learned Brahmins give their blessings. On that day, feed all the guests with love.

One should not perform the *choul* ceremony for a child whose mother is pregnant. If the child is five years old and the mother is pregnant, there is no harm in performing the *choul* ceremony. 

150. If the *choul* ceremony has not been performed from the time of conception, one should perform *prāyaścitta* by offering *ājya* with *vyāhṛti* mantras. 

151. *Choul* is the name given to the ceremony of shaving a child's head (removing the *jadūla*). This ceremony is performed in almost all communities, and it makes the child strong and healthy. This is stated according to Jain scriptures. 

The householder should perform the *choul* ceremony for the child according to the family tradition on the first, third, fifth, or seventh year. If the *choul* ceremony is performed while the child's mother is pregnant, either the mother will miscarry or the child will die. Therefore, one should not perform the *choul* ceremony while the mother is pregnant. However, if the child is five years old and the mother is pregnant, there is no harm in performing the *choul* ceremony. If the rituals from conception to the *choul* ceremony have not been performed, one should perform *prāyaścitta* by offering *ājya* with *vyāhṛti* mantras. 

147-151. 

The child should be bathed with fragrant water on an auspicious day and auspicious constellation. 

152. The child should be adorned with clothes and ornaments.

Place six clay lamps filled with cow dung in the north direction, one after another. Then lift them and place them around the child. Next, place a knife, scissors, seven blades of grass, and a razor on a water-filled pot. Offer flowers, fragrance, and rice grains on them. The child's father, after taking a bath, should stand in front of the child sitting in the mother's lap. Holding a vessel of cold water in one hand and a vessel of hot water in the other, he should pour the water from both vessels into a third vessel. Then, add turmeric and yogurt to the water and sprinkle it on the child's hair with his left hand. Wash the hair with his right hand. After that, rub the hair with butter and wash it with warm water. Finally, wash the hair with the water from the auspicious pot, and then sprinkle it with fragrant water. (152-159)

Then, three sections are made on the right side of the child's hair. In the first section, the hair is cut with scissors. (160)

Place a bowl of rice in front of the child. The father, holding a piece of Khadira wood, five blades of grass, flowers, fragrance, and a razor in his left hand, should make a braid of the child's hair. Holding the braid with his thumb and fingers, he should cut the hair with the scissors in his right hand. (160-162)

**Mantra:** "Om Namo Aite Bhagavate Jinesvaraya, Mama Putra Upanayanamundamundito Mahabagi Bhavatu Bhavatu Swaha."

While cutting the hair, chant this mantra. After cutting the hair, give it to the mother along with leaves of the Sami tree. The mother, saying "Tatha Bhavatu," should put the hair in a cow dung lamp after mixing it with milk and ghee.

In the second section, place a bowl of sesame seeds in front of the child. Holding the same tools as before, the father should cut the hair while chanting the mantra: "Om Namah Siddhaparameshtine, Mama Putro Nirgranthamundabagi Bhavatu Swaha." Then, he should give the hair to the mother. The mother should follow the same procedure as before.

**Third Stage:** While cutting the hair, place a barley seed in front of the child. Holding the razor and other implements, recite the mantra: "Om Hreem Namah Aachaarya Parameshtine Mama Putro Nishkranti Mundha Bhagi Bhavatu Swaha." Then cut the hair and perform the rest of the ritual as before.

**Left Side:** Divide the hair on the left side into two parts. While cutting the first part, place a lentil seed in front of the child. Holding the razor and other implements, recite the mantra: "Om Namah Upadhyaya Parameshtine Mama Putro Aindrabhagi Bhavatu Swaha." Then cut the hair and give it to the mother. The mother should say "Tatha Bhavatu" and apply milk and ghee to the hair before placing it in a cow dung lamp.

**Second Stage:** While cutting the hair, place a lamp with leaves of the Sami tree in front of the child. Holding the razor and other implements, recite the mantra: "Om Hau Namah Sarva Sadhu Parameshtine Mama Putro Paramrajya Keshabhagi Bhavatu Swaha." Then perform the rest of the ritual as before.

**Final Stage:** Wash the remaining hair with warm water. Recite the mantra: "Om Hreem Pancha Parameshti Prasadat Keshanvaya Shiroh Raksha Kushali Kuru Napita." Then the father should give the razor to the barber. The barber should say "Bhavad Ipsitartho Bhavatu" and shave the remaining hair, leaving the tuft. Then, place the hair, milk, ghee, grains, and cow dung lamps in a river with great fanfare. After bathing the child, adorn him with clothes and ornaments. Bring him home and offer oblations to the Yakshas and other deities. Then, perform a purification ceremony and feed the guests.

**Chapter 2:  Initiation into Learning**

**Verse 163:** A child should be taught the alphabet before the second birth, that is, before the Upanayana ceremony.  After the Upanayana, the study of scriptures begins.

**Verse 164:**  The child should be taught the alphabet in the fifth or seventh year, before the Upanayana.  This should be done during the Uttarayana (northern solstice).

**Verse 165:**  Wise people say that the initiation into learning should be done in the following constellations: Mrigashira, Ardra, Punarvasu, Pushya, Ashlesha, Mula, Hasta, Chitra, Ashwini, Purvashadha, Purvabhadrapada, Shravana, Dhanishtha, and Shatabhisha.

**Verse 166:**  The results of starting learning on different days of the week are as follows: Sunday - increases lifespan, Monday - sharpens intellect, Tuesday - leads to death, Wednesday - enhances memory, Thursday - develops wisdom, Friday - fosters intuition, Saturday - weakens the body.

**Verse 167:**  One should always avoid starting learning on the following days:  Anudhyaya (days of fasting), Pradosha (twilight), Shashthi (sixth lunar day), and Riktatithi (fourth, ninth, and fourteenth lunar days).

**Verse 168:**  Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday are considered auspicious for starting learning.  Monday and Sunday are moderate, while Saturday and Tuesday are inauspicious.

**Verse 169:**  When the child turns five years old and the sun enters Uttarayana, the auspicious time for teaching the alphabet arrives.  At this time, one should worship Saraswati and the guardian deity of the land with offerings of jaggery, rice, etc.

**Verse 170:**  Thus, one should initiate learning at the appropriate time, after worshipping the Goddess, the Guru, and the scriptures.

**Recite this mantra while writing the letters.**

**Method of Receiving the Book.**

**179.** All the letters should be learned from the mouth of the teacher. The book should be received on an auspicious day, with the performance of Homa and other rituals as before.

**180.** The student should honor the teacher with clothes, garlands, etc., and then, with both hands joined in a bud-like position, face east and sit down.

**181.** The teacher should give the book to the student with joy. The student should then read the scriptures, after reciting the Nandi.

After this, the child should begin to read the book, having learned the letters from the mouth of the teacher, on an auspicious occasion. At this time, perform Homa and other rituals as before. The child should honor his teacher with clothes, garlands, etc., and worship the book, joining both hands, facing east, and sitting down. The teacher should give the book to the child with great joy, and the student should begin to read the book after reciting the Nandi.

**179-81**

**Conclusion.**

**182.** Garbhaadhan, Moda, Pumsavana, Seemanta, Preeti, Supreeti, Priyodhbhava, Jaatakarma, Naamakarma, Bahiryaan, Upaveshan, Annaprashan, Gamanavidhi, Vyushtikriya, Chaulakarma, Aksharasanskar, and Pustak-Grihan - these fifteen rituals are described in this chapter of the Jineendraagama.

**183.** Those virtuous men who perform these fifteen rituals, become proficient, attain purity of conduct, and enjoy the wealth of Lakshmi in this world. They are praised by Shri Somaseṇa and attain the bliss of liberation.

**Garbhaadhan, Moda, Pumsavana, Seemanta, Preeti, Supreeti, Priyodhbhava, Jaatakarma, Naamakarma, Bahiryaan, Upaveshan, Annaprashan, Gamanavidhi, Vyushtikriya, Chaulakarma, Aksharasanskar, and Pustak-Grihan - these fifteen rituals are mentioned in this chapter. Although these rituals are seventeen in number, Preeti, Supreeti, and Priyodhbhava are included in one, because they are performed together, unlike other rituals which are performed at different times. Therefore, the meaning of the verse should be understood by including all three in one. Alternatively, according to another reading, "Etaa Saptadasha Kriyaa: Samuditaa Asmin Jineendraagame," one should understand that there are seventeen rituals. The rituals whose names are not mentioned in the verse, but whose description has been given, should also be included by the use of the conjunction "cha." Those clever and virtuous men who perform these fifteen rituals, enjoy inexhaustible wealth in this world, attain purity of conduct, and are praised by Muni Somaseṇa, thereby attaining the bliss of liberation.**

**Thus ends the eighth chapter of the Shri Dharmarasikasastra, composed by Bhattaraka Shri Somaseṇa, entitled "Description of the Fifteen Rituals of Garbhaadhan, etc."**

## Chapter 9: The Trivarna Ceremony

**Salutations:** I bow to the glorious Sri Sumahendra Kirti, the supreme teacher, who guides us across the ocean of knowledge. He is a treasure trove of penance, filled with virtues, pure and unique in this age. May he protect me from the ocean of worldly existence, a fortress of ignorance and suffering, for he is the yogi king who has not been defeated by the evils of pride and other vices. ||1||

I pay my respects to the victorious Sri Ajitanatha Jinendra, who has conquered the enemies of desire and who grants happiness to the liberated souls. Following the tradition of the gurus, I will now describe the virtuous act of the Yajnopavita. ||2||

**The Upanayana Ceremony:** The Upanayana ceremony for a Brahmin should be performed in the eighth year after birth, for a Kshatriya in the eleventh year, and for a Vaishya in the twelfth year. ||3||

For a Brahmin who desires knowledge, the ceremony should be performed in the fifth year, for a Kshatriya who desires strength in the sixth year, and for a Vaishya who desires wealth in the eighth year. ||4||

The final time for the Upanayana ceremony for Brahmins, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas is sixteen years, twenty-two years, and twenty-four years respectively. ||5||

Those who do not perform the Upanayana ceremony within these time limits are considered to be excluded from all religious duties. They should not be involved in any religious activities, such as establishing temples, by the best of Brahmins. ||6|| 

Page #299:
---------------------------
Those who are excluded from religious duties by the **Bhadrabahu** commentary written by **Somasen Bhattaraka** should be considered as outcast. It is the duty of the best Brahmins not to appoint such men in auspicious ceremonies like **pratiṣṭhā** etc. ||5-6||

Thus says the **Ācārya**: The father should perform the **upanayana** ceremony of the boy. In the absence of the father, the father's father (grandfather) should perform it. In the absence of the grandfather, the father's brother (uncle) should perform it. In the absence of the uncle, any male member of the family should perform it. And if there is no male member of the family, then any male member of the same **gotra** should perform it. A **dvija** who performs the **vratabandhana** of a boy without the permission of his father, goes to hell due to ignorance. ||7-8||

Seeing such injunctions, many people are surprised and try to remove the faith of simple beings from **Jainism** by sweet-talking them with their deceitful writings. They say that those who write such things have completely disregarded the **karma** philosophy of the Jains. But we ask them, can such **karma** not bind one to hell if the conditions are met? Do you want that after performing such actions, he should immediately go to hell? If such actions do not bind one to hell, then what are those actions that bind one to hell and not others? Even if we assume that such actions do not bind one to hell, there will be some binding of **karma** if you believe in the **karma** philosophy. Then tell us, will it be a binding of **punya** or **papa**? If even those who violate the rules are bound by **punya**, then why did **Umasvami**, **Samantbhadra**, and other great sages mention the **viruddha rājya-atikram** (violation of the king's order) as a great sin? Imagine that the government has made a rule. Someone violates it. He is sent to jail for this. Then tell us, did he go to jail because of the violation of the rule or because of the **karma**? If you say that he went to jail because of the violation of the rule, then you have disregarded the **karma** philosophy. If you say that he went to jail because of the **karma**, then when and by what actions did he bind that **karma**? If you say that it must have happened due to some actions in the past, as a result of which he had to go to jail, then why not accept here also that such actions bind one to hell and that he will go to hell due to their fruition in the future? If those who violate the rules are bound by **punya**, then those who directly violate the laws of the state and go to jail must also be bound by **punya**. Blessed are such **punya** bindings! The bad fruits of which are being experienced directly, and yet it remains **punya** binding. Therefore, we have to accept that such actions bind one to **papa**. Even if we assume that such actions do not bind one to the great **papa** of hell, they will definitely bind one to other **papa** **karma**. And when those **papa** **karma** mature, this being will commit great sins due to them, and then he will definitely be bound to hell. In such a situation, we have to say that this situation has arisen due to the **papa** binding of the past. So, the effect is in the cause, or the cause is in the effect. 

Page #300:
---------------------------
It is not wrong to say that the Trivarna code is like this. If you are saying that one should go to hell only after doing such acts, then the one whom you consider a great sinner, does he also go to hell only after committing a great sin? If you say that there is no rule, then it is fine, why not accept here also that he goes there at the same time or later, there is no rule. The author's intention is only that it is not good to violate the limits, the result of which is going to hell etc. How he has taken the karma philosophy and kept it in the balance, it is not understood at all. Even in things that are logical, unnecessary doubts are raised. This all seems to be the result of not understanding karma philosophy. 
**Son Determination:**- A son born from oneself, a son of a daughter, a given son, a purchased son, a raised son, a brother-in-law and a disciple, these are the seven types of sons. || 9 ||
**Thread Strength:**- A thread of one hundred and forty hands long, triple it. Then triple it again by dividing it from the inside. || 10 ||
**Yajnopavita:**- Taking it in the house, the wife should spin it herself with her own hand. Make a white Yajnopavita from that thread. || 11 ||
**Yajnopavita Restrictions:**- After the Nandi Shraddha is done, in case of meteor shower, fire rain, excessive rain and Sutak etc., do not perform the Mauji-bandhan-sanskar. If the mother of the child whose Yajnopavita is to be performed becomes menstruating, then his Yajnopavita sanskar should not be performed. Because this is destructive to the child's life. There is a method of eating with the mother at the time of Yajnopavita. If the mother becomes menstruating after it is over, then there is no harm. 

Page #301:
---------------------------
## English Translation:

262

It is not written by Somasen Bhattaraka. This is what the previous Acharyas say. If the mother of the girl becomes menstruating after the Nandi Shraddha is completed at the time of the girl's marriage, then the father of the girl should give the girl in marriage. This is what the Jinadeva says. || 12-15 ||

When the auspicious planet and auspicious yoga are present, one should bathe the child who is eligible for the Mauji Bandhan, adorn him with clothes and ornaments, and feed him with his mother. || 16 ||

After shaving his hair, one should leave a tuft of hair. Apply turmeric, ghee, vermillion, and durva on his head. || 17 ||

Then bathe him again, sprinkle him with auspicious words, and water mixed with kusha grass. Apply fragrant sandalwood at the end of the ghee portion. || 18 ||

Perform Nandi Shraddha, worship, homa, and musical instruments (playing music), and Guru Puja in front of him, as before. || 19 ||

In the approaching auspicious time, recite the Graha Stotras, and always remember the Pancha Namaskara mantra. || 20 ||

The child should sit in Padmasana (cross-legged) facing north, with his eyes open and a joyful expression, looking at his father's face for the purification of his second birth. || 21 ||

Standing in front of the child, the father, in an auspicious time, should look at the child's face and apply a tilak on his forehead with fragrant sandalwood. || 22 ||

Tie the Mauji, which is three times the length of the forearm, and is auspicious, with a thread around the waist, and a knot on the waist. || 23 ||

Mantra: Om Him Katimdeshe Mauji Bandham Prakalpayami Swaha. Having said this, tie the Mauji with three knots around the waist. 

Page #302:
---------------------------
## Trivarna Acharya:

**Verse 23:**

The Trivarna Acharya consists of three strands of Mauji (cotton thread) twisted together to form a single rope. This rope is then tripled and tied into a knot, forming a Mauji-bandhan. This Mauji-bandhan is then imagined as a Katiliṅga (phallic symbol) and placed over the Kaupīna (loincloth) and Kati-sūtra (waistband). After reciting the mantra "Om Hi Katipradese" etc., three knots are tied in the Mauji-bandhan and it is then tied around the waist.

**Mantra:** Om Namo'hate Bhagavate Tirthankara Parameshvaraya Kati-sūtram Kaupīnasahitam Maujībandhanam Karomi Punyabandho Bhavatu Asi Ā U Sā Svāhā.

**Meaning:** After reciting the mantra "Om Namo'hate" etc., the Mauji is taken in the hand and flowers and Akshata (unhusked rice) are sprinkled on it.

**Verse 24:**

The Yajñopavita (sacred thread) is made of three precious substances (Ratnatraya) and is pure. It is colored with turmeric and sandalwood and imagined as a Uroliṅga (phallic symbol).

**Mantra:** Om Namah Paramasantaya Santikaraya Pavitrikritarha Ratnatrayasvarupam Yajñopavitam Dadhami Mama Gatram Pavitram Bhavatu Aham Namah Svāhā.

**Meaning:** This Yajñopavita is a symbol of the chest, so understand it as such. After reciting the mantra "Om Namah Paramasantaya" etc., the Yajñopavita is worn on the chest.

**Verse 25:**

The Brahma-granthi (knot) on the top of the head is imagined as a Shiroliṅga (phallic symbol) and is purified by the contact of the dust from the lotus feet of the Jina.

**Mantra:** Om Namo'hate Bhagavate Tirthankara Parameshvaraya Kati-sūtraparameshthinē Lalāṭe Shekharam Shikhāyāṁ Pushpamālāṁ Cha Dadhāmi Māṁ Parameshthinaḥ Samuddharantaṁ Om Śrī Hi Aham Namah Svāhā.

**Meaning:** The top of the head is considered as the Shiroliṅga and the Brahma-granthi is tied on it. After reciting the mantra "Om Namo'hate" etc., a garland of flowers is worn on the head, a tilak (mark) is applied, and new dhoti and dupatta are worn.

**Verse 26:**

The person, wearing new dhoti and dupatta, performs Achamana (ritual rinsing of the mouth) and Tarpan (offering of water to ancestors) according to the prescribed rules.

**Verse 27:**

Then, joining the palms together, offering flowers, Akshata, and fruits, the disciple requests the Acharya for the vows (Vrata) that lead to liberation.

**Verse 28:**

Hearing this, the Acharya instructs the disciple on the vows of the Shravaka (lay follower). The disciple receives these vows with reverence and the bija mantra (seed mantra) from the mouth of the Guru.

## English Translation:

**264**
Composed by Somasen Bhattaraka. That boy, wearing a dhoti and a dupatta, should perform Achaman, Tarpan and Arghya-daan as per the rituals. Afterwards, he should make an Anjali (offering) with gandha (perfume), akshat (rice grains) and fruits and request the Acharya for initiation with the desire for liberation. Upon hearing his request, the Acharya Maharaj should initiate him into the vows according to the Shravaka-achar (conduct of a lay Jain). That boy should accept the vows and the bija-mantras (seed mantras) given by the Acharya Maharaj with great joy. || 26-28 ||
... Mantra "Om Him Shrim Klim Kumarsyopayananam Karoomi Ayam Vimottama Bhavatu A Si Aa U Sa Swaha. Iti Triruchcharya Aghoram Panchanamaskaram Upadeshet." || The Acharya should chant this mantra three times and then teach him the vows and the Panchanamaskar mantra.

Page #304:
---------------------------
## Trivarna Achar (Three-fold Conduct)

**265:**

The child should leave the homashala (sacred fire place) and come out into the courtyard. There, he should perform achaman (ritual mouth rinsing) and, looking at the sun, offer an ardha (half) of water. Afterwards, he should pour a stream of water around the abhi (sacred fire) and offer three ahuti (offerings) into it, with the intention of peace, using sami (a type of wood) as the samidha (fuel), shali (rice) as the chaval (rice), laj (lai) (a type of grain), milk, ghee (clarified butter), and naivedya (offering). Then, he should wash his mouth, join his lips, and touch his mouth with his hands, warming them three times. Afterwards, he should perform the upasthapana (offering) of the agni (fire) and then immerse it. After that, it is the child's duty to beg for food until he has completed his vidya-abhyas (studies); therefore, he should leave the house with his patra (begging bowl) after taking permission from his guru (teacher). || 33-36 ||

**37:**

He should step out of the house with his right foot forward and walk slowly. He should go to the houses of the Brahmanas (priests) and beg for alms according to the teachings of his guru.

**38:**

While begging, he should speak without hesitation, saying, "Bhavati, please give alms," in such a way that the householders, who are following the conduct of the three varnas (castes), can clearly hear him.

**39:**

The Brahmanas believe that there are four branches of knowledge: Prathama-anuyoga, Karana-anuyoga, Charana-anuyoga, and Dravya-anuyoga.

**40:**

The housewife should offer a handful of rice to the child, mentioning the branch of knowledge that is practiced in her family.

**41:**

Seeing the child begging for alms, his relatives should say, "O child, you are still young, do not go to distant lands."

**42:**

"Stay here, near your guru, and always study. You will bring happiness to all members of our family."

**43:**

Accepting their words, the child should go to the jinalaya (Jain temple) and perform the rituals of worshipping the Jina (Tirthankara), starting with the homa (fire sacrifice).

**44:**

He should then feed all the Brahmanas and others according to the proper procedure, and honor the punyarya (holy ones) with clothes, ornaments, and betel leaves. 

Page #305:
---------------------------
Living in the family created by Somasen Bhattaraka, make everyone happy. Hearing these words, that child should accept them and go to the Chaityalaya. There, he should perform Homa, Jinpujan, and other rituals. After that, he should feed Brahmanas and all other humans, and honor them appropriately with gifts of clothing, ornaments, and betel nut, according to the proper procedure. || 41-44 ||

Bodhi-pujan. On the fourth day, after bathing in the presence of his father, he should perform the Homa-puja and other rituals in a concise manner, as appropriate. || 45 || He should go with proper care to worship a beautiful Peepal tree, located in a pure place, free from cutting, burning, etc. || 46 || He should adorn the trunk of the tree with Darbha, flower garlands, and turmeric-dyed threads, and water its roots with water. || 47 || In the eastern direction of the tree, he should build a square platform and create a circular fire pit in it. He should perform Homa with nine nine pieces of firewood and ghee, etc. || 48 || May I have purity, worthiness for worship, and the knowledge of the truth, like you. May I also become a Bodhi-tree like you, and may I be a bearer of the mark like you. || 49 || He should pray to that tree, the king of trees, as the cause of all auspiciousness. After circumambulating the tree three times, he should return home with joy. || 50 || By doing this, there is no falsehood, as it is a worldly practice. After eating, he should satisfy everyone and stay at home. || 51 || He should perform this ritual every month, starting with Homa-puja. || 52 || This ritual is considered essential, especially in the month of Shravan. 

Page #306:
---------------------------
## Jain Rituals

**267**

**Meaning:** Offering water to the sun, giving charity on the day of a solstice, bathing in rivers like the Ganges, worshipping trees, worshipping lakes - these are considered folk beliefs in the scriptures. Here, the scriptures mention tree worship as a form of darkness, so it should be included in folk beliefs. However, the author writes that performing these worldly rituals does not lead to false beliefs. This suggests that there is some hidden meaning behind them. Just as we bathe in wells and ponds for the purification of the body, bathing in rivers like the Ganges is not a folk belief. But bathing in them with the desire for a boon (desired fruit) is a folk belief. If we bathe at home and do so with the desire that it will lead us to heaven and liberation, this desire is also against the ultimate goal and therefore false. Therefore, one should understand that those who bathe in the Ganges and Yamuna with such intentions should be considered as indulging in folk beliefs, and those who bathe normally, like they do at home, are not indulging in false beliefs. It is not fair to call someone who is bathing in the Ganges according to their daily routine or simply bathing as indulging in false beliefs. Mere words mean nothing, it is the intentions of the person bathing that matter. Offering water to the sun with the desire for heaven and liberation is false. But offering water to the sun according to specific rituals during the installation ceremony is not false, as is well known in all installation scriptures. Giving charity on the day of the solstice with the desire for heaven and liberation is false, but if someone who naturally gives charity every day out of devotion or compassion also gives charity on that day, it is not fair to call them indulging in false beliefs. Worshipping a lake is false, but the worship of a lake during the installation ceremony is not false. Honoring the goddesses Kali, Chandi, and Mundi is false. But honoring them appropriately during the installation ceremony is not false. This will be accepted by those who know the complete installation scriptures. We have nothing to say to those who do not accept any scriptures. But our great scholars and knowledgeable men of religion consider the installation ceremony as evidence and perform installations accordingly. They will surely accept these aforementioned points. This implies that performing these actions for peace without desiring heaven, liberation, etc., in specific rituals is not false. Similarly, worshipping the Bodhi tree with the desire for enlightenment in this specific ritual of the sacred thread ceremony should not be considered false. However, there may be a doubt here: how can enlightenment be attained from that inert substance? The solution is that the inner cause of attaining knowledge is the cessation of its obscurations, and there are many external causes. It is possible that just as knowledge is obscured by the field, it may also be obscured by doing this. The field is also inert. Just as knowledge is obscured by inert substances like books, it may also be obscured by that tree. Inert objects have an effect on the soul. There are many examples of this. It is possible that the soul may also be affected by that tree.

**Written by Somasen Bhattarak**

...

It is not right to disregard everyone simply by calling them inert. We bow down to temples, holy places, Samavasaranas, all instruments related to the Supreme Soul, fragrant water, and many other inert substances. Just as it is right to do so with those intentions, it can also be right with the intentions of this time. However, if motivated by this desire, we always bow down to heaven or something similar, or if we consider that tree as a deity and bow down to it whenever it comes into our sight, it is certainly foolishness. People who worship the Peepal tree always or on special days are also foolish. From these things, the statement of the blind does not seem incorrect. For those who consider the image of the liberated soul, its hymns, and the rituals of installation as inappropriate, everything is inappropriate. They consider even the Yajnopaveet Sanskar inappropriate, let alone tree worship. The essence of what is being said is that every statement is relative. If we remove the relativity from them and consider them, then contradictions will appear in all the subjects of Jainism. And if we consider them with the same relativity, then the contradiction will not be known. Take the example of Vyavahar Nay and Nishchay Nay. Without practice, theory is not effective, and without theory, practice is not effective. In one place, the householder's life, sons, etc., are highly praised. In other places, they are considered despicable. Is this not a contradiction? But if we consider it with relativity, there is not even a speck of contradiction. Similarly, the giving of offerings to the sun, worship of trees, giving charity on Sankranti, bathing in the Ganges and Yamuna, etc., are considered bad with those expectations. It is certainly bad to do these things with those expectations. And with those expectations where these are not prohibited, it is not bad to do them either. It is only necessary to consider the place.

**Verse 53:**

A virtuous soul who wears the Yajnopaveet should perform the evening rituals, such as bowing, etc., in all three periods, i.e., morning, noon, and evening, after a year has passed.

**Verse 54:**

It is said that a traveler should wear two Yajnopaveets, and others should wear two. Only one is considered pure for those who are celibate for a limited period.

**Verse 55:**

Two Yajnopaveets should be worn for worship and charity. The third is for the upper garment, and it is desired in the absence of clothes.

**Verse 56:**

The Brahma Sutra, from the thread to the end, is pure. If it is shorter, there will be illness and poverty; if it is longer, there will be destruction of Dharma.

**Verse 57:**

One who desires longevity should wear two or three Yajnopaveets. One who desires sons should wear five. One who desires Dharma should also wear five.

## Trivarnika Achar

**The Trivarnika Achar**

A child should wear one Yajnopavit. A householder and a Vanaprastha should wear two Yajnopavit. For a Brahmachari who remains celibate for a fixed period, one Yajnopavit is most sacred. While performing puja and giving charity, one should wear two Yajnopavit. The third Yajnopavit is for the Uttariya-Vastra (upper garment). It serves as a substitute for the garment in the absence of one. The Yajnopavit should be long enough to reach from the hole in the palate to the navel. If it is shorter than this, it will cause disease, and if it is longer, it will destroy Dharma. One who desires the well-being and happiness of his life should always wear two or three Yajnopavit. A man who desires a son and Dharma should wear five Yajnopavit. If one performs Japa, Homa, etc., wearing only one Yajnopavit, all of it will be in vain. No Dharma-karma will be successful. If the Yajnopavit falls or breaks, one should wear a new one after taking a bath and making a Sankalpa (resolution). One should wear each Yajnopavit with a separate mantra and perform Achaman (sipping water) for each Sankalpa. This is what the ancient sages have said. If one wears the Yajnopavit with one mantra and one Sankalpa, then if one breaks, all should be considered broken, there is no doubt. Because all the Yajnopavit worn with one mantra and one Sankalpa become the same.

**Yajnopavit, Ananta, Munji, and Danda**

The child should always keep the Yajnopavit, Ananta, Munji, and Danda with him. If these things break, he should wear new ones and throw the broken ones into water.

**Wearing a Dupatta**

Just as the Yajnopavit is worn for all actions, so also a dupatta should be worn for all actions, just as the Yajnopavit is worn on the body. And in water rituals, it should be tied with the Yajnopavit.

**Composed by Somasen Bhattaraka**

**Arr.man**
**.musmann..**

A cotton **yajnopavit** should be worn by a **Vip** (Jain monk) above the waist, with three threads. A **hem** (gold) thread **yajnopavit** should be worn by a king, and a **patta** (cotton) thread **yajnopavit** by a **Vaishya** (merchant). || 64 ||

One should not wear a **yajnopavit** that is **uccishta** (used by someone else), **toran** (touched by a **toran**), **chhinna** (broken), **drikrita** (made with two threads), **vidhava** (made by a widow), **bhutotare** (made after eating), or **anadhya** (made on an inauspicious day). || 65 ||

In case of **sutak** (impurity due to death), **pataka** (sin), **mlana** (dirt), or **abhyanga** (oil application), the **yajnopavit** should be removed from the neck and washed thoroughly with water. || 66 ||

**Vratacharya** (ritualistic practices)

Now, I will explain the **vratacharya** (ritualistic practices) of this **balaka** (young Jain monk) who wears the **katiling** (sign on the waist), **uruling** (sign on the chest), **shiroling** (sign on the head), and **anuchana** (sign on the body). || 67 ||

The **katiling** of this **balaka** is the **moujibandha** (sacred thread) made with three threads. It is a sign of the **dwijanmi** (twice-born) men, signifying the purity of the **ratnatraya** (three jewels). It indicates that he has been born twice, once through birth and once through the **yajnopavit** ceremony. || 68 ||

The **uruling** of this **balaka** is the **sadhauta** (washed) **sita** (white) **shataka** (cloth) worn on the chest. It signifies that the **arhata** (worthy) **kula** (family) of the **Jain** is pure and vast. || 69 ||

The **uroling** of this **balaka** is the **yajnopavit** made with seven threads. It signifies the seven **paramasthanas** (supreme abodes) that will be explained later. || 70 ||

The **shiroling** of this **balaka** is the **maundayam** (shaving of the head) that is **anavila** (uninterrupted). The **maundayam** signifies the **mano** (mind), **vacha** (speech), and **kaya** (body) of the **balaka** that are **upabanhita** (controlled). || 71 ||

## The Code of Conduct for a Jain Student

**271** The complete tonsure of the head, free from any defects, is the ultimate head-symbol for the child, which enhances purity of mind, speech, and body. || 71 ||

Thus, with this symbol, he should maintain purity, strengthened by the renunciation of gross violence, celibacy, etc. || 72 ||

The child, adorned with the four symbols mentioned above, should renounce gross violence, practice celibacy, and observe other pure vows. || 72 ||

He should not use a tooth-stick, chew betel nut, or apply collyrium to his eyes. He should not bathe with turmeric, etc., but should bathe with pure water once a day for mental purification. He should not sleep on a cot, nor should he touch another person's body. He should sleep alone on the ground for the sake of his own purity. || 73-74 ||

**Initiation into Vows**

In the month of Shraavana, on the star Shravana, he should perform the preliminary rituals, like the homa (fire sacrifice), etc., and discard the sacred thread worn around his waist. || 75 ||

From that time onwards, he should wear clothes suitable for a householder, sleep on a bed, and chew betel nut, all under the supervision of his guru. || 76 ||

Alternatively, these vows should continue until the completion of his studies. After that, he should observe the vows suitable for a householder. || 77 ||

**Meaning:** Until the completion of his studies, the vows mentioned above should be observed. Afterwards, these vows are relinquished, and he should observe the eight-fold vows, etc., suitable for a householder. || 77 ||

He should learn the code of conduct for a lay follower from his guru, with humility. After that, he should study other scriptures dealing with spirituality. || 78 ||

##  Translation:

**272**

This is written by Somasan Bhattaraka. The 77th and 78th verses are from the Adipurana.  Following this, the Adipurana further explains that one should study grammar and logic to awaken their good qualities and for the sake of fame. There is no harm in studying these after reading the Shravaka Achar. One should also study astrology, prosody, omens, and mathematics with special attention. After studying these subjects, the previously mentioned vows of the Vrata Avataran are relinquished. This is because these vows were for a specific purpose. Afterwards, one remains in their natural vows. The vows of abstaining from honey, the five Udumbar fruits, and the five sins of gross violence, etc., are permanent for the rest of their life.

**79**

The Vrata Avataran ceremony takes place after twelve or sixteen years. It involves worship, homa, etc., with the guru's witness.

**80**

One should accept clothes, ornaments, garlands, etc., with the guru's permission. If one is a Kshatriya, they should carry weapons. If one is a Vaishya, they should engage in business.

**81**

If any of the three varnas commit a sin, they should perform atonement.

**78-81**

**Faults and Atonement**

**82**

If one unknowingly consumes up to twenty tolas of alcohol, meat, and honey, they should perform three fasts, twelve one-meal days, one hundred and eight offerings of food, and the same number of baths. They should also perform two pilgrimages and offer flowers and akshata according to their ability.

**83**

**84**

If one has eaten in the house of a Mlechchha, etc., they should perform thirty fasts, thirty-five one-meal days, and donate two hundred vessels. They should also give one cow, five pots, perform two hundred water ablutions, offer flowers and akshata, and perform two pilgrimages.

##  The Jain Code of Conduct for Purification

**Trivarnika Achar**

**Chapter 275**

A person who kills aquatic animals, land animals, birds, rats, squirrels, dogs, etc. in their own home, must purify themselves by observing twelve days of fasting, sixteen days of one-meal-a-day, sixteen baths, and giving cows and other deserving recipients gifts as much as they are able, according to the instructions of their Guru. (101-102)

A person who kills cows, buffaloes, or goats must observe twenty-three days of fasting, one hundred days of one-meal-a-day, and give gifts as much as they are able. (103)

A person who kills a human being must observe three hundred days of fasting, give cows and other deserving recipients gifts, and perform pilgrimages as much as they are able. (104)

If a person dies due to poison or other harmful substances, or due to hunger, or if a servant dies due to hunger, or if a human or animal dies due to being brought into the house, or if someone dies while digging a well or pond, or if a servant dies while carrying the master's belongings, or if someone dies due to a wall falling, or if a woman dies due to fire, or if someone comes into contact with a butcher and engages in business transactions with them, then they must observe five days of fasting, give a cow, observe fifty-two days of one-meal-a-day, perform a puja for the Sangha, give gifts of compassion, offer flowers, and engage in japa (chanting). (105-108)

If a clay pot used for cooking or fetching water comes into contact with a person of a different caste, it should be discarded. If copper, brass, or iron pots come into contact with a person of a different caste, they can be purified by washing them with pure ash. Brass pots can be purified by washing them with fire. Wooden pots cannot be purified. It is better to use copper, brass, or iron pots that have not come into contact with people of different castes. (109-110)

**Not pure.**  And vessels made of bronze, copper, tin, brass, etc., if they have been touched by other non-Jain substances, become pure by being washed with water and *ani* (a type of clay). || 109-110 ||

**If wine, meat, excrement, urine, phlegm, or honey is placed in a vessel, that vessel should not be used by the best of the Shravakas.**  It is a kind of injustice to use such vessels. || 11 ||

**Sieves, cloth, brooms, pestles, and grinding stones, if touched by other non-Jain substances, become pure by being washed with water.** || 112 ||

**If something is eaten in a dream, it should be abandoned for three days.**  If meat is eaten in a dream, two fasts should be observed. || 113 ||

**If one's celibacy is broken due to being overpowered by sleep, one should perform one thousand japa and three *ekashana* (one-meal) fasts.** || 114 ||

**If one has sexual intercourse with one's mother or sister in a dream, one should observe two fasts and perform one thousand japa.** || 115 ||

**If one eats at the house of a *mithyadrishti* (non-Jain) or a Shudra at night, one should observe five fasts and perform two thousand japa.** || 116 ||

**Thus, this is a brief explanation of the rules of atonement.**  For a more detailed explanation, one should consult other scriptures. || 117 ||

**In this way, the *maunjibandhan* vow should be observed.**  Who would abandon atonement, the source of virtue?  **The righteous deeds of the great sages should be protected.**  May the virtuous Somasen Muni be blessed with merit. || 118 ||

**In essence, it is proper for those seeking merit to perform righteous deeds.** || 118 ||

## Chapter 10: The Conduct of the Three-Garbed

**Invocation:**

May the Lord Jinendra, the friend of the lotus of the three worlds, who is always pure, whose character is the giver of liberation, and who has nurtured many devotees, be victorious and bring you joy now. May the Lord Dharmanatha, through devotion, grant you the abode of Shiva - may he bring you well-being. ||1||

**The Ritual of Accepting the Vow:**

The disciple, adorned with the sacred thread, endowed with great virtues and wealth, should, along with his family, approach the lofty abode of the Lord Jinendra. ||2||

He should wash his feet and enter the temple slowly. After performing worship and seeking peace, he should approach the Guru. ||3||

With great devotion, he should offer fruit to the Guru and perform the five-fold prostration, joining his hands and bowing his head. Then, with humility, he should inquire about well-being and sit on the ground. The Guru, through teachings on Dharma, should also please the disciples. ||4-5||

"O Master, please kindly explain in detail the conduct of the Shravakas." Hearing this humble request of the disciple, the Guru should explain the Shravaka Dharma thoroughly. ||6||

**The Explanation of Dharma:**

The abandonment of falsehood, the acceptance of right faith, and the observance of the twelve types of vows - these are the essential principles. ||7|| 

Page #317:
---------------------------
## 278

O, noble assembly, listen! I expound to you the Dharma spoken by Sri Jinendradev, which brings about your welfare. First, worldly beings should abandon Mithyatva and embrace Samyagdarshan. They should also observe the twelve Vratas: five Anuvratas, three Gunavratas, and four Shikshavrata. || 7 ||

As it is said in other scriptures:

"The being who is in Mithyatva is a deluded soul, with a distorted vision. He does not find Dharma appealing, and he harbors intense aversion towards it, just as a sick person finds even sweet taste bitter." || 8 ||

Those whose consciousness is gripped by Mithyatva, even though human, behave like animals. And those whose consciousness is illuminated by Samyaktva, even though animals, behave like humans. || 9 ||

There are three types of Mithyatva: Agṛhīta, Gṛhīta, and Saṁśayika.

Agṛhīta Mithyatva is the result of the non-acceptance of the truth about the soul, which has been passed down through an endless lineage, without any external guidance. This type of Mithyatva envelops certain beings, from those with one sense organ to those with five sense organs, in a dense darkness, preventing them from ever believing in the truth.

Gṛhīta Mithyatva is the acceptance of falsehood through the influence of others. This type of Mithyatva makes beings with five sense organs behave like possessed spirits.

Saṁśayika Mithyatva is the wavering doubt about whether Samyagdarshan and other factors leading to liberation are true or not. This type of Mithyatva, like a sharp arrow, pierces the hearts of certain followers of the Shvetambara sect, such as Indracharaya, the head of the Indrachandra Nagendra Gachchha. || 10 ||

Even if someone is in a state of bad karma, but their Mithyatva karma is weak, they may not harbor aversion towards the true Dharma, even though they are attached to false Dharma. Such a person is called a "Bhadra Mithyadrishti" (a person with a good, but false, vision). This Bhadra Mithyadrishti is worthy of receiving teachings about Jain Dharma because they have the potential to attain Samyaktva in the future. However, someone who is "Abhadra" (bad), whose Mithyatva karma is strong, and who harbors intense aversion towards Jain Dharma, is not worthy of receiving teachings. || 11 || 

Page #318:
---------------------------
## Woman's Vow

**Trivarna Acharya.**

**Five types of Mithyatva:**

"The one who is blind, deluded, and ignorant is called a **Tavaso** (deluded). The one who is doubtful is called a **Makardi** (doubter). The one who is completely ignorant is called an **Annani** (ignorant)." (12)

The one who believes in **Ekant Mithyatva** (absolute falsehood) is a **Buddhist**. The **Brahman** holds a **Vipreet Mithyatva** (opposite falsehood) and believes that killing beings in sacrifices leads to liberation. The **Tapas** holds a **Vinay Mithyatva** (false belief in discipline) and believes that liberation can only be achieved through discipline. The **Indracharaya**, the head of the **Indrachandra Nagendra Gachchha**, holds a **Sanshay Mithyatva** (doubtful falsehood) and remains in doubt about whether **Samyak Darshan** (right faith), **Samyak Gyan** (right knowledge), and **Samyak Charitra** (right conduct) are the causes of liberation. Therefore, he accepts liberation from all. The **Maskari Muni**, a scholar of the **Dwadashanga** (twelve parts of Jain scriptures) who was born in the **Tirth** (pilgrimage site) of **Shriparshvanath Tirthankara**, holds an **Ashan Mithyatva** (false belief in ignorance) and believes that liberation is achieved through ignorance. (12)

**Causes of the emergence of Samyaktva:**

"The one who is **Asanna Bhavya** (near to liberation), whose **Mithyatva** (falsehood) and other **Karmas** (actions) have been destroyed, who is **Sanjni** (conscious), who possesses **Shuddha Parinam** (pure results), and whose **Mithyatva** has been destroyed through **Deshana** (teaching), **Jati Smaran** (recollection of past lives), etc., is eligible for **Samyaktva** (right faith). In other words, **Asanna Bhavya** (near to liberation) and other factors are the causes of the emergence of **Samyaktva**." (13)

**Regarding opposing views:**

"One should never believe in the doctrines of those with **Dushta Buddhi** (evil minds) who have spoken about the **Tattvas** (principles) of committing sins like **Himsa** (violence) in their opposing views. These **Tattvas** are full of **Himsa Pataka Dosha** (sins of violence)." (14)

**Characteristics of a true Dev (God):**

"The one who is **Sarv Darshi** (all-seeing), **Sarv Gya** (all-knowing), **Siddh** (liberated), **Aapt** (perfect), **Niranjan** (free from impurities), free from the **Astadash Maha Dosha** (eighteen major flaws), is called a **Dev** (God)." (15)

**Names of the eighteen flaws:**

"**Kshutta** (hunger), **Udgbha** (thirst), **Yara** (attachment), **Roga** (disease), **Rosh** (anger), **Maran** (death), **Sweda** (sweat), **Khed** (sorrow), **Arati** (discontent), **Chinta** (worry), **Janma** (birth), **Jara** (old age), **Vismaya** (wonder), **Mad** (intoxication), **Nidra** (sleep), **Vishad** (dejection), **Moha** (delusion). The **Jina** (victorious one), free from these eighteen flaws, is **Shree Vitraga** (free from attachment). He is the **Param Daivat** (supreme deity) who protects all beings with compassion and kindness." (16) 

Page #319:
---------------------------
**Verse 16**

Free from the eighteen vices:  *śuon*, *tuṛṣā*, *gegē*, *bhary*, *rāgē*, *deṣa*, *maraṇam*, *svēda* (sweat), *khēdam*, *arati*, *cintā*, *janma*, *jarī* (old age), *vismaya* (pride), *mardai* (arrogance), *nidrī*, *viṣāda*, and *moi*, the compassionate Jina, the supreme deity of beings, protects all worldly beings from sin.

**Verse 17**

The nature of true scripture:  That which is not contradictory to the past and future, is well-established, speaks the truth, destroys false understanding and gives true understanding, is scripture.  Such scripture should be studied for the attainment of liberation.  

**Meaning:**  That which possesses these qualities is *āgama*.  On the other hand, that which causes suffering in the world, teaches worldly desires, is *āgamāmāsa*.  That which appears like *āgama* but lacks the aforementioned qualities is called *āgamābhāsa*.  Since the *dhārātiya* ācāryas are one-sided, free from attachment, omniscient, benevolent towards worldly beings, and true teachers, their *āgama* should be studied with devotion for one's own welfare.

**Verse 18**

The qualities of a guru:  He who is free from the desires of the five senses, free from the four types of possessions, avoids worldly pursuits like agriculture, and is immersed in knowledge and austerity day and night, is a praiseworthy guru.  Such an austere person can be a guru.

**Verse 19**

The qualities of *samyagdṛṣṭi*:  One who has unshakeable certainty in the true nature of the divine, the guru, and scripture, is to be known as *samyagdṛṣṭi*, free from the eight doubts.

**Meaning:**  To have faith in the divine, the guru, and scripture without any doubts is *samyagdṛṣṭi*.

**Verse 20**

The qualities of unshakeable faith:  One should not doubt the divine, scripture, the guru, or the mantras they teach, by questioning whether there is any exaggeration in them.  Pure *samyagdṛṣṭi* should not doubt the omniscient and others by questioning such trivial matters.

**Meaning:**  Not doubting the omniscient and others by questioning whether there is any exaggeration in them is unshakeable faith.

## The Characteristics of the Jain Virtues:

**1. Nishkankshit (Desireless)**

The characteristic of a desireless person is that they are:

* **Dependent on karma:** Their existence is governed by their past actions.
* **Finite:** They have a beginning and an end.
* **Intermittent suffering:** They experience periods of suffering interspersed with periods of happiness.
* **Cause of sin:** Their actions lead to the accumulation of negative karma.

Therefore, a desireless person is one who does not crave worldly pleasures, recognizing their impermanence and the suffering they ultimately lead to.

**2. Nirvichikitst (Doubtless)**

The characteristic of a doubtless person is that they:

* **Naturally impure:** Their body is inherently impure.
* **Purified by the three jewels:** They have been cleansed by the three jewels of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct.
* **Free from disgust:** They do not feel repulsed by their own body.
* **Delighted in virtues:** They find joy in practicing virtuous actions.

Therefore, a doubtless person is one who has overcome the negativity associated with their physical body and finds joy in the pursuit of virtue.

**3. Amudhadristi (Unconfused Vision)**

The characteristic of a person with unconfused vision is that they:

* **Do not agree with false beliefs:** They reject false doctrines and their proponents.
* **Do not associate with false believers:** They avoid contact with those who hold false views.
* **Do not praise false beliefs:** They do not speak favorably of false doctrines.

Therefore, a person with unconfused vision is one who has a clear understanding of truth and avoids all forms of falsehood.

**4. Upgrihun (Rebuking)**

The characteristic of rebuking is:

* **Addressing the shortcomings of the ignorant:** It involves correcting the mistakes and misconceptions of those who are not fully knowledgeable about Jainism and its practices.

Therefore, rebuking is a form of guidance and correction aimed at helping others understand and follow the true path.

**5. Sthitikaran (Stabilization)**

The characteristic of stabilization is:

* **Restoring those who have deviated from the path:** It involves guiding those who have strayed from the principles of right faith and right conduct back to the path of righteousness.

Therefore, stabilization is a process of supporting and encouraging individuals to return to the true path of Jainism.

**6. Vatsalya (Affection)**

The characteristic of affection is:

* **Showing compassion to those who are suffering:** It involves extending kindness and support to those who are struggling, especially those who are devoted to Jainism.

Therefore, affection is a manifestation of love and care for all beings, particularly those who are striving for spiritual liberation.

##  The Nature of the *Pravahana* Limb (as Composed by Somasen Bhattaraka)

**27.**  The *Pravahana* limb is the means by which the darkness of ignorance is dispelled and the greatness of the Jina's teachings is revealed to those who seek the ultimate truth.

**28.**  Right faith, nurtured by the eight limbs, is pure and brings liberation.  Just as a mantra that is even one syllable short cannot cure the pain of poison, so too, right faith that lacks even one limb cannot sever the cycle of birth and death.

**29.**  There are twenty-five impurities that taint right faith: three types of foolishness, eight types of pride, six types of *anayatanas*, and eight faults like doubt.  These impurities defile right faith, so one must avoid them.

**30.**  Foolishness of the world includes:  regarding the cow's genitals as sacred and worshipping them, consuming cow dung and urine, worshipping the sun and moon, performing sati by jumping into fire, and dying by falling from a mountain.

**Further Examples of Worldly Foolishness:**

* Bathing during an eclipse
* Sleeping on the day of a solstice
* Donating silver, copper, etc. on the day of a solstice
* Worshipping at dusk
* Reverencing fire as a deity
* Worshipping the body
* Worshipping a house
* Worshipping gems, vehicles (oxen, etc.), land, trees, weapons, mountains, etc.
* Bathing in rivers and oceans

**Note:** Cow dung is considered pure in eight ways.  Here, the prohibition is against consuming it, worshipping it, etc.  Some people consider cow dung to be completely impure and unclean, but this is incorrect.  It is mentioned in the eight types of worldly purity.  If it were completely impure, then land touched by it would not be considered pure, and it would not be used in *nirajana* (ceremony with a lamp) and other rituals.  

**As the *Charitra Sara* states:**

... 

Page #322:
---------------------------
## Trivarnika Achar | 283

This means that there are eight types of worldly purity - cleanliness, based on the distinctions of time purity, fire purity, ash purity, clay purity, cow dung purity, water purity, knowledge purity, and freedom from doubt purity. Although cow dung is produced from the body, it is considered pure in the world. For example: - Even though they are born from the body, cow dung, cow urine, ivory, cow hair, musk, rhinoceros horn, peacock feathers, snake gem, conch, pearl, etc. have attained purity in the world. - Charitrasar.

The meaning of this is that it is worldly foolishness to consider cow dung and cow urine as sacred and worship them as deities. It is not worldly foolishness to purify the land with them. It is worldly foolishness to worship the moon and the sun in the same way as they are worshipped in the world. But it is not worldly foolishness to honor them during the time of Jain initiation, etc. There is a difference in meaning here. It is worldly foolishness to worship all ordinary things as deities and offer them salutations, etc. But it is not worldly foolishness to perform three types of worship related to Jain glory, such as offering fire, etc., to apply its ashes on the head, and to offer salutations. Similarly, it is worldly foolishness to worship all ordinary mountains. But it is not worldly foolishness to worship mountains like Sammed Shikhar, Girnar, Shatrunjaya, Taranga, etc. It is also not worldly foolishness to worship the Bodhi (Banyan) tree, the Chaitya tree, and the land of the Jain temple during the Yajnopavit Sanskar. Why are all ordinary things, trees, mountains, etc., not worthy of worship, and why are some specific ones worthy of worship? The answer is that those who are connected to the Jain Tirthankaras are worthy of worship; others are not. Wise people should consider for themselves the possibility and impossibility of worldly foolishness.

## Devamudhata | 31

One who is hopeful due to the desire for a boon, and who is stained with the dirt of attachment and aversion, and who worships the deities, is called a Devamudha. || 31 ||

Meaning - Swami Samantabhadracharya calls the worship of deities who are stained with the dirt of attachment and aversion, with the desire for worldly results like the attainment of one's desired boon, Devamudhata. That is absolutely correct. There is no obstacle of any kind in this. But the thought is that in our great scriptures, bathing scriptures, initiation texts, etc., written by the sages, the worship of the presiding deity is found everywhere. The order of worship is the same in all the scriptures on this subject, as described in the fourth chapter of this scripture. The only difference is that some have described it in detail and some have described it briefly. Then this thought arises: how is there such contradiction in the scriptures? But if we consider without prejudice, then, although this is thoughtless... 

Page #323:
---------------------------
## AANHRA

It appears that there is opposition to the **Purushas** as described by **Somasen Bhattaraka**, however, there is no real opposition. The meaning of the first statement should be understood, that is, what is the intention behind this prohibition and what is the expectation behind this statement? **Shriprabhachandracharya** has clarified this very verse in the **Ratnakaranda** commentary. If one contemplates this with full understanding, then the answer to all doubts can be found in a short time. He writes that worshipping the **Shasan-Devas** out of personal desire is **Devamudhata** (foolishness regarding the divine). However, respecting them by considering them as **Shasan-Devas** and devotees of **Sadharma** is not **Devamudhata**. There is no room for any doubt left after the statement of **Acharya Maharaj**. This resolves everything. Many people point out this statement of **Shriprabhachandra** as being against **Swami Samantabhadracharya**. We ask them, what is the opposition here? They will say that **Shrisamantabhadracharya** prohibits the worship of **Devas** and **Shriprabhachandracharya** advocates it. The solution is that **Swami Samantabhadracharya** prohibits the worship of **Devas** with a **mithyadristi** (false view) that is tainted by **raga** (attachment) and **dvesha** (aversion) out of personal desire. **Prabhachandracharya** also prohibits this. As for the statement of respecting the **Shasan-Devas** by considering them as **Shasan-Devas**, **Samantabhadracharya** does not prohibit this. Because he has used the words "**Varopalipsaya**" and "**Ashavan**" in the verse. This indicates that **Swami Samantabhadracharya** does not prohibit the respect of **Shasan-Devas**. However, if one respects the **Shasan-Devas** out of personal desire, then perhaps the accusation of **Devamudhata** may arise. Therefore, the views of **Shrisamantabhadracharya** and **Shriprabhachandracharya** are not contradictory in this matter.

The second point is that if the respect of **Shasan-Devas** is not found in other **Rishi**-authored texts and **Shriprabhachandracharya** had mentioned it for the first time, then perhaps one could say that the views of **Shrisamantabhadracharya** and **Shriprabhachandracharya** are contradictory. However, the respect of **Shasan-Devas** is mentioned in many **Rishi**-authored texts like **Yashastilaka Champu** by **Shrisomdevsuri**, **Prakrit Bhavasangraha** by **Shridevsen Suri**, **Upasakadhyayan**, **Pratistasara**, **Trilokprajnapti** etc. by **Vasunand Siddhantachkravarti**. **Shasan-Devas** are **Jinbhakta** (devotees of **Jina**). Those who are **Jinbhakta** are **Samyagdristi** (possessors of right view). The fact that **Shasan-Devas** are **Jinbhakta** is found in **Rishi**-authored texts even before **Samantabhadracharya**. In **Harivansha Purana**, there are many prayers to **Shasan-Devas**. There are many **Rishi**-authored **mantra** texts like **Bhairava-Padmavatikalpa**, **Jwalamalini Kalpa**, **Siddhachakra Kalpa** etc., which also prove the respect of **Shasan-Devas**. Therefore, respecting the **Shasan-Devas** according to the method described in the **Agamas** is not **Devamudhata**. And there is no contradiction between the words of **Samantabhadracharya** and **Prabhachandracharya**.

**Pakhandimudhata** (foolishness regarding hypocrisy):

**Pakhandisudhata** | **Sagrantharambhinsaanam Sansaravartavarthinam** | **Pakhandinam Puraskarah Jneyah Pakhandimudhata** || 32 ||

Those who possess various types of **parigraha** (attachments), who initiate many things, who are full of **himsa** (violence), and who are trapped in the cycle of **samsara** (world) - in the snare of **moha** (delusion), respecting such **Pakhandis** (hypocrites) as **gurus** who can guide them across the ocean of **samsara** is **Pakhandimudhata**.

**Meaning:** One who is capable of guiding **bhavya jivas** (evolving souls) across the ocean of **samsara** through their **dharmopadeśa** (religious teachings) and who themselves are capable of crossing the ocean of **samsara**, their welfare is... 

Page #324:
---------------------------
## 285

A teacher who practices the three-fold code of conduct (**Trivarnika Achar**) can be a true guru. On the contrary, one who engages in various misdeeds, is deeply immersed in the cycle of birth and death, is captivated by the objects of senses, whose words contradict each other, who misguides beings by giving false teachings, is not a guru - he is actually a stone boat. A stone boat sinks itself and drowns others. Crossing the ocean on such a stone boat is not only difficult but extremely difficult. Therefore, beings seeking happiness should not be lured by the sweet words of such men and should not trap their souls in their web of words. || 32 ||

- **Eight types of pride (Ashta Mada):** Pride in wealth, worship, lineage, caste, strength, beauty, austerity, and body. These eight constitute the eight types of pride. || 33 ||

- **Six things to avoid (Anayatana):** One should avoid association with a false god and his devotee, a false scripture and its reader, and a false guru and his disciple. These six are called **Anayatana**. The true god, the true guru, and the true scripture, along with their devotees, are the six pillars of Dharma. The ones mentioned in the above verse are not pillars of Dharma, hence they are called **Anayatana**. Association with these six pollutes Dharma-Samyaktva. Therefore, those with right vision should avoid association with these six. || 34 ||

- **Eight defects (Shankadi Ashta Dosha):** Doubt, desire, aversion, silence, acceptance, instability, lack of affection, and disrespect. These eight are defects that should be abandoned by those who possess Samyaktva. One should always be devoted to the true guru and scriptures. || 35-36 || 

Page #325:
---------------------------
##  Three Types of Samyaktvam

**Samyaktvam is of three types:** Kshayik Samyaktvam, Kshayopa-shaamik Samyaktvam, and Aupa-shaamik Samyaktvam.  Kshayik Samyaktvam is the highest, Kshayopa-shaamik Samyaktvam is the middle, and Aupa-shaamik Samyaktvam is the lowest.  

**Origin of the Three Samyaktvams:**

There are three types of natures: Mithyatva, Samyak-mithyatva, and Samyaktvam.  There are also four types of Ananta-anuvandi: Krodha, Mana, Maya, and Lobha.  These seven together are called Kshaya.  The destruction of these seven leads to Kshayik Samyaktvam.  The suppression of these seven leads to Aupa-shaamik Samyaktvam.  The destruction and suppression of these seven leads to Kshayopa-shaamik Samyaktvam.  All three types of Samyaktvam lead to liberation.

**Eight Qualities of Samyaktvam:**

Samyaktvam has eight qualities:  Samvega, Nivega, self-criticism, self-respect, Upashama, Bhakti, Vatsalya, and Anukampa.

**Four Fields and Samyaktvam:**

Samyaktvam arises when the Ayukarma related to the four fields (Naraka-kshetra, Tiryanch-kshetra, Manushya-kshetra, and Deva-kshetra) are destroyed.  However, the fifth Gunasthan (Anuvrata-Deshavirata) and the sixth and seventh Gunasthan (Mahavrat) do not arise when the Ayukarma related to the three fields (Naraka-kshetra, Tiryanch-kshetra, and Manushya-kshetra) are destroyed.  They only arise when the Ayukarma related to the Deva-kshetra is destroyed.

**Samyaktvam and Birth Places:**

Samyaktvam does not arise in the twelve places where Mithyatva is born.  These twelve places are: the six earths except for the first Naraka-bhoomi (Ratna-prabha), the three types of Devas (Jyotishi, Vyantar, and Bhavanvaasi), and the three types of women (Deva-angana, Manushya-niya, and Tiyach-niya).  In these twelve places, only Mithyatva is born.  However, after being born in these places, the possibility of attaining Samyaktvam arises. 

Page #326:

## Trivarnika Achar | 387

**Samyagdarshan** can be attained by those who have **Samyagdarshan**. **Samyagdarshan** is not born in the five **Thavars**, three **Vikalendriyas**, five **Asangi Panchaindriyas**, **Nigodhis**, and **Kumog-bhumis** even after death; and these beings do not have **Samyagdarshan**. || 41-43 ||

**The nature of Kshayopaśamika-Samyaktva**

The **Samyagdarshan** that arises from the destruction of **Darshan-moha** is called **Kshayopaśamika-Samyagdarshan**. This **Samyaktva** is **chal**, **malin**, and **agaadha**. Its nature is to be known from the **Gommatasar Jivakanda**. || 44 ||

**The characteristics of Aupaśamika-Samyaktva**

The **Samyagdarshan** that arises from the destruction of **Darshan-moha** is called **Aupaśamika-Samyaktva**. This **Samyaktva** is like **clean water** after the impurities have settled down. It is **nirmal** for a short time, until the **karma-malas** start to bear fruit again. || 45 ||

**The nature of Kshayika-Samyaktva**

The **Samyagdarshan** that arises from the destruction of **Darshan-moha** is called **Kshayika-Samyaktva**. This **Samyaktva** is **nitya** - once it is attained, it never goes away. It is the cause of **karma-khavana**. || 46 ||

This **Samyaktva** is not affected by **words**, **reasons**, **fearful forms**, **disgusting objects**, **disgust**, or even the **three lokas**. This **Samyaktva** is never destroyed, no matter what obstacles it faces. It always shines brightly in the soul. || 47 ||

**Darshan-moha-khavana** is the **karma-bhoomi** from which **man** becomes **kevalimula** and **vigho** in all respects. || 48 || 

Page #327:
---------------------------
## English Translation:

**28**

A human being born in the Karmabhumi, as described by Somasen Bhattaraka, is the one who begins to destroy the obstacles to right faith (darshan-moha) and completes its eradication everywhere. || 48 ||

**49**

When the obstacles to right faith are destroyed, liberation occurs in one lifetime, or in the third or fourth lifetime. But liberation never gets delayed in the fourth lifetime - it happens inevitably in the fourth lifetime. Just as the temporary right faith (aupashamik samyaktv) and the right faith with the destruction of karmas (kshayopashamik samyaktv) are attained and then abandoned, the right faith with the destruction of karmas (kshayik samyaktv) is attained once and never abandoned.

**Meaning:** If a human being attains the right faith with the destruction of karmas (kshayik samyaktv) and is a charma-shariri (one who will attain liberation in this lifetime), then liberation happens in the same lifetime. In this case, liberation happens in one lifetime. If he has already accumulated the karma for hell, then he goes to hell, and if he has not accumulated the karma for hell, then he goes to heaven. After being released from heaven, he becomes a human being and attains liberation. In this way, liberation happens in three lifetimes - one human lifetime, one hell or heaven lifetime, and another human lifetime.

If a human being attains the right faith with the destruction of karmas (kshayik samyaktv) after accumulating the karma for a lower rebirth (tiryach) or a human rebirth, then after death, he becomes a human being or a lower being (tiryach) in the realm of enjoyment (bhog-bhumi). From there, after death, he directly goes to heaven. After being released from heaven, he attains a human rebirth and then attains liberation. In this case, there are four lifetimes - one human lifetime when the right faith is attained, another lifetime in the realm of enjoyment, a third lifetime in heaven, and a fourth lifetime as a human being. Liberation never happens in the second lifetime. || 49 ||

**50**

If a human being is morally corrupt (vratadhrushta) but has right faith (samyaktv) in his mind, then he is a worthy soul (bhavya) who has come from his past actions. Therefore, he will inevitably attain liberation by adhering to the right conduct (charitra). || 50 ||

**51**

Praise for right faith (samyaktv): The birth, existence, growth, and attainment of liberation (moksha) of right knowledge (samyaggyan) and right conduct (samyakcharitra) do not occur without right faith (samyaktv). Just as a tree cannot grow, exist on earth, grow, or bear fruit without a seed. || 51 ||

**52**

There is nothing in the three realms (trijagat) and in the three times (traikalya) that is equal to right faith (samyaktv) in terms of benefiting living beings. And there is no other enemy of the soul (tanubhrut) equal to wrong faith (mithyatv). One should abandon wrong faith (mithyatv) and embrace right faith (samyaktv). || 52 || 

Page #328:
---------------------------
## 289
Mananuman
**Trivarnika Achar.**  Due to the bondage of the Ayukarma related to the path of misery, the one who attains Samyaktva, does not have a break in their path - they must inevitably go through that path. However, their Ayukarma's state remains very short. || 53 ||

Those who are devoid of vows, who have no vows of any kind, but are pure in Samyagdarshan, do not go to hell or the animal realm after death, they do not become women or eunuchs, they are not born into a bad family, they do not have deformed bodies, they do not have short lifespans, and they are not poor. But - || 54 ||

They, the souls purified by Samyagdarshan, become radiant in the human realm, possessing great brilliance, complete knowledge, excellent strength, immense fame, and abundant wealth. They are born into noble families, they are seekers of Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha, and they are the best among humans, like a jewel on the forehead. || 55 ||

These Jinabhakta souls with Samyagdarshan, in heaven, are content with the eight Siddhis, and are adorned with abundant beauty. They enjoy themselves for a long time in the assemblies of gods and celestial nymphs. 1. Anima, 2. Mahima, 3. Laghima, 4. Garima, 5. Antaradhana, 6. Kamarupitva, 7. Prati, 8. Prakamya, 9. Vashitva, 10. Ishitva, and 11. Apratihatva, these are the eleven Siddhis, out of which eight are attained in heaven. || 56-57 ||

These Samyagdarshan souls, in the human realm, are even more powerful. Here, they are the masters of the nine Nidhis and fourteen Ratnas; they are the lords of the six-part earth, they rule the earth with absolute power, and thirty-two thousand kings and emperors bow their heads at their feet. Besides this, they achieve many other excellent deeds and, by the power of this Samyagdarshan, they attain liberation. || 58 ||

##  Characteristics of Right Knowledge (Samyak Jnana)

**59.**  Right knowledge is that which knows the true nature of a thing without any deficiency, excess, or contradiction. It is free from doubt and is known as Right Knowledge by the knowers of the Agamas.

**Meaning:** Right knowledge is the knowledge of the true nature of a thing, free from doubt, contradiction, and misinterpretation.

**60.**  The knowledge of the first Anu Yoga is that which knows the four Purusharthas (goals of life) - Right Faith, Right Knowledge, Right Conduct, and Liberation - through the virtuous stories (Charitra) and ancient scriptures (Puranas) that are full of merit. It is the treasure of the Three Jewels (Right Faith, Right Knowledge, Right Conduct) and meditation.

**Meaning:** The scriptures that describe the lives of individuals (Charitra) and the lives of 63 Tirthankaras (Puranas) are full of merit. They explain the four Purusharthas and lead to the attainment of the Three Jewels and meditation. Therefore, these scriptures should not be neglected or considered trivial. They reveal the true nature of things and are known as the knowledge of the first Anu Yoga, which is a form of Right Knowledge.

**61.**  The knowledge of the second Anu Yoga is that which clearly shows the division of the world (Lok) and the non-world (Alok), the cyclical nature of the Yugas (epochs), and the four paths of existence (Gatis) like a mirror.

**Meaning:** Just as a mirror reflects the objects placed in front of it, the scriptures of the second Anu Yoga clearly explain the division of the world and the non-world, the cyclical nature of the Yugas, and the four paths of existence. This knowledge is known as the knowledge of the second Anu Yoga.

**62.**  The knowledge of the third Anu Yoga is that which knows the causes of the origin, growth, and protection of the conduct of householders and monks, as described in the scriptures of the third Anu Yoga.

**Meaning:** The scriptures of the third Anu Yoga describe the conduct of householders and monks, their growth, and the factors that protect their conduct. This knowledge is known as the knowledge of the third Anu Yoga. 

Page #330:
---------------------------
## Trivarnika Achar

**291**

The doctrine that explains the means of protection is called Charananuyog Shastra. The essence of this Shastra is called Charananuyog Shan, and this Shan is Samyaggyan. || 62 ||

**Dravyanuyog Gyan:** The lamp of Dravyanuyog Gyan illuminates the essence of Jiva, Ajeeva, Puny, Papa, Bandh, Moksha, and Shruta Vidya. || 63 ||

The lamp called Dravyanuyog illuminates the essence of Jiva, Ajeeva, Puny, Papa, Bandh, Moksha, and Shruta Vidya. The meaning is that the Shastra which mainly describes these topics is called Dravyanuyog Shastra. The knowledge of this is called Dravyanuyog Gyan. This knowledge is also Samyaggyan. In summary, all four types of Shastras are Samyak Shastras, and their knowledge is Samyaggyan.

**Samyak Charitra:**

The abstinence from the five sins - violence, falsehood, stealing, sexual misconduct, and attachment - is the Charitra of the Samyaggyanis. || 64 ||

There are two types of Charitra: Sakal Charitra and Vikal Charitra. Sakal Charitra is possessed by the great monks who are free from all kinds of attachments. Vikal Charitra is possessed by householders who have attachments. || 65 ||

**Characteristics of Sagara (Householder):**

Those who are afflicted by the four fever-like ailments of food, fear, sexual misconduct, and attachment, which are born from the three doshas of ignorance, bile, and phlegm, are always detached from their self-knowledge and are immersed in worldly desires. They are the householders who live in homes and families. || 66 ||

A householder who is free from attachment, even while living in a home and family, is on the path to liberation. A monk who is caught in the web of various attachments is not on the path to liberation. Therefore, a householder free from attachment is superior to a monk who is attached. || 67 ||

**Characteristics of Shravak with Samyagdrishti:**

One who is established in the eight roots and virtues, is free from the seven vices, and is devoted to the words of the true Guru is called one with Samyagdrishti. || 68 || 

Page #331:
---------------------------
## 292
**The one who possesses the eight fundamental virtues, renounces the seven vices, and is devoted to the words of the true Guru, is called a Samyakdrishti.** || 69 ||

**The names of the eight fundamental virtues:**

* **Nadi** (avoiding the consumption of alcohol)
* **Adhajja** (avoiding meat)
* **Yaini** (avoiding honey)
* **Ma** (avoiding the five types of milk products)
* **Gna** (avoiding the five types of fruits)
* **Hi** (avoiding violence)
* **Sa** (avoiding stealing)
* **Pa** (avoiding lying)

**A householder should first renounce violence, then renounce alcohol, meat, honey, and the five types of milk products, while having faith in the Jina-Aaja.** The nature of these has been described earlier. || 69 ||

**The eight fundamental virtues for householders are:**

* **Sthulavadha** (avoiding killing of large creatures)
* **Adi** (avoiding killing of small creatures)
* **Va** (avoiding stealing)
* **Phalasthane** (avoiding the consumption of fruits)
* **Smara** (avoiding the consumption of ghee)
* **Madhusthane** (avoiding the consumption of honey)
* **Iha** (avoiding the consumption of milk products)
* **Cha** (avoiding the consumption of alcohol)

**According to Bhagavat Somadev Suri, Amritchandra Suri, and other Acharyas, these eight are called the fundamental virtues.** Bhagavan Samantabhadracharya considers the renunciation of killing large creatures, etc., as the five Anuvratas, and the renunciation of the three Makaras as the eight fundamental virtues. Bhagavan Jinaseenacharya considers the renunciation of gambling in place of honey, the five Anuvratas, the renunciation of alcohol, meat, and gambling as the eight fundamental virtues. || 70 ||

**Some texts mention the following as the eight fundamental virtues:**

* **Madhyaviraati** (renunciation of alcohol)
* **Mansaviraati** (renunciation of meat)
* **Madhuviraati** (renunciation of honey)
* **Nishaashanaviraati** (renunciation of eating at night)
* **Panchaphaliviraati** (renunciation of the five types of milk products)
* **Panchaatmaanuuti** (praise of the five great beings)
* **Jivadaya** (compassion for all living beings)
* **Jalgalana** (drinking water after filtering)

**There is no contradiction in the teachings of the Acharyas regarding these fundamental virtues.** The aim of all is the renunciation of violence. Since the conduct of householders is Desh-charitra (conduct based on the specific region), and there are many parts to a region, it is not surprising that there are many variations in the fundamental virtues, ranging from the lowest to the highest. However, the conduct of monks is Sakal-charitra (universal conduct). There is no variation in their external fundamental conduct. The conduct of householders has many variations. Otherwise, it would not be Desh-charitra. In all, there is a gradual increase in the renunciation of violence. This gradual increase reaches its peak in the conduct of monks. Therefore, one should not perceive any contradiction in the teachings of the Acharyas.

**The conduct of householders is of three types:**

* **Anuvrat** (minor vows)
* **Gunavat** (virtuous conduct)
* **Shikshavat** (conduct based on teachings)

These are respectively of five, three, and four types. || 72 ||

**The nature of the five Anuvratas:**

* **Praanaatipaata** (avoiding violence)
* **Vithavyahaara** (avoiding false speech)
* **Steya** (avoiding stealing)
* **Kaama** (avoiding sexual misconduct)
* **Moochha** (avoiding intoxication)

**Renunciation from these five major sins is called Anuvrat.** || 73 || 

Page #332:
---------------------------
## Trivarnika Achar | 2.93

**The Anuvrat of Non-Violence**

73. The abandonment of the five sins: gross violence, gross lying, gross stealing, gross consumption of intoxicants, and gross attachment, is called Anuvrat.

**The Essence of Non-Violence**

74. When the soul is filled with passions, it first destroys itself. Whether or not it then harms other beings is a secondary matter.

**Explanation:** The arising of passions like anger is called violence. When the soul is angry, it destroys its own nature. Whether or not it harms external beings in such a state, the violence of the mind is already present. Therefore, it is appropriate to abandon passions.

**Abandonment of Gross External Violence**

75. Wise people call the non-killing of living beings through thought, speech, body, and action, inaction, and approval, the Anuvrat of gross non-violence.

**Five Transgressions of the Anuvrat of Non-Violence**

76. Cutting, binding, beating, overloading, and withholding food are the five transgressions of the Anuvrat of non-violence. Those who observe the Anuvrat of non-violence should also abandon these five transgressions.

**The Nature of the Anuvrat of Truthfulness**

77. Not speaking gross lies, not causing others to speak lies, and not speaking truth that would bring harm to others, is called the Anuvrat of truthfulness by the wise.

**Five Transgressions of the Anuvrat of Truthfulness**

**The nature of the Acharanuvrata (non-stealing vow).**

**79.**  Whether it is kept, fallen, forgotten, or a hereditary possession, one should not take another's property, nor should one give it to others. This is to be free from gross stealing - the Acharanuvrata.

**The five transgressions of the Acharanuvrata.**

**80.**  Teaching others the methods of stealing, taking things stolen by thieves, not paying government taxes, mixing inferior quality goods with superior quality goods and selling them, and using more weight for buying and less weight for selling are the five transgressions of the Acharanuvrata. An Acharanuvrati should abandon these.

**The nature of the Brahmacharyanuvrata (celibacy vow).**

**81.**  Out of fear of sin, one should not engage in sexual intercourse with another's wife, nor should one cause others to do so. This is the Brahmacharyanuvrata. It is also called Swadarasantoṣ (contentment with one's own wife).

**The five transgressions of the Brahmacharyanuvrata.**

**82.**  Arranging marriages for others' sons and daughters, engaging in sexual activity with parts of the body other than the genitals, using obscene language, excessive desire for sexual pleasure, and going to the houses of women who are either married or unmarried but are involved in adultery are the five transgressions of the Brahmacharyanuvrata. A Brahmacharyanuvrati should abandon these.

**The nature of the Parigrahaparimanavrata (limited possessions vow).**

**83.**  To limit the amount of wealth, grain, and other possessions to a certain amount and not desire more than that is Parigrahapariman. It is also called Icchapariman (limited desire).

**The five transgressions of the Parigrahaparimanavrata.**

**84.**  Excessive vehicles, excessive accumulation, amazement, greed, and carrying excessive burdens are the five transgressions of the Parigrahaparimanavrata. 

Page #334:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

**The Five Excesses in Parigraha-Parimana:**

1. **Ati-vahana:** Driving humans or animals beyond their capacity due to greed.
2. **Ati-sanpraha:** Accumulating excessive amounts of grains, believing they will yield more profit, driven by greed.
3. **Vismaya:** Feeling envious when someone else profits more by selling a commodity that was sold at a lower price or was not collected by oneself.
4. **Lobha:**  Desiring more profit even when a reasonable profit is already achieved.
5. **Ati-bhararopan:** Loading more weight than one's capacity due to greed.

These five excesses are violations of the Parigraha-Parimana principle. Those who practice Parigraha-Parimana should abstain from these. || 84 ||

**The Six Anuvratas:**

1. **Vada-viraati:** Abstaining from violence.
2. **Asatyaviraati:** Abstaining from falsehood.
3. **Chauryaviraati:** Abstaining from stealing.
4. **Abrahmaviraati:** Abstaining from sexual misconduct.
5. **Parigrahaviraati:** Abstaining from excessive possessions.
6. **Ratribhukti:** Abstaining from eating at night.

These six are the Anuvratas. || 85 ||

**Explanation:**

The root of all violence is attachment (raga) and other negative emotions. Since all sins stem from these emotions, all vows ultimately fall under the vow of non-violence. However, simply stating the vow of non-violence may not be clear to those with limited understanding. Therefore, separate vows like abstaining from falsehood, stealing, etc., are explained to make it easier to comprehend.

Similarly, some might think that abstaining from eating at night is not a part of the Anuvratas, and therefore eating at night is not a sin. Hence, the Anuvrata of abstaining from eating at night is explicitly mentioned.

It is also incorrect to say that abstaining from eating at night is not related to violence. We have already established that attachment is violence, and eating at night increases attachment. Therefore, violence is present wherever there is attachment. Additionally, harming external beings is more prevalent at night. Hence, external violence is also more prevalent. Therefore, abstaining from eating at night falls under the category of violence, considering both internal and external violence.

Eating at night, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and excessive possessions are all destructive to the soul and therefore constitute violence. These are explained separately for the sake of clarity. Therefore, the argument that abstaining from eating at night is not related to violence is completely unfounded.

Just as different aspects like lying, stealing, etc., are explained separately to clarify the nature of violence, some Acharyas explain abstaining from eating at night separately from violence to dispel any confusion among disciples.

**The Virtue of Abstaining from Eating at Night:**

One who abstains from eating for two hours after sunrise and two hours before sunset, understanding the great sin of eating at night, is considered to be consuming virtuous food. || 86 ||

**Somasen Bhattaraka's Composition**

**Fruits of Observing the Five Anuvratas**

The five Anuvratas, like treasures, when observed without transgression, bear fruit in the Murlok (heavenly realm). There, the eight Siddhis (supernatural powers) like Anima (the power of becoming small) and Mahima (the power of becoming large), which fulfill all desires, are attained along with the knowledge of the Avadhi (clairvoyance). || 87 ||

**Three Gunavratas**

The three Gunavratas, namely Dinna (non-violence), Anarthadanda (non-acceptance of gifts), and Bhogopabhoga-parimana (limitation of enjoyment), protect and purify the eight fundamental virtues like non-intoxication. Therefore, great souls like the Ganadharas have called them Gunavratas. || 88 ||

**The Nature of Digvrat**

"Having defined the boundary, I will not go beyond it." This resolve, made until death, is called Digvrat, which eliminates subtle sins. || 89 ||

The boundaries of the ten directions are well-known: the sea, river, forest, mountain, country, and yojana (a unit of distance). || 90 ||

**Five Transgressions of Digvirati Vrat**

The five transgressions of Digvirati Vrat are: exceeding the upper limit due to ignorance or carelessness, exceeding the lower limit, exceeding the limit in a diagonal direction, increasing the defined area, and forgetting the defined limit. Digvirati Vratis should avoid these transgressions. || 91 ||

**The Nature of Anarthadanda-virati Vrat**

To refrain from all actions that lead to sin, both internal and external, is called Anarthadanda-virati Vrat, as explained by the great souls. || 92 || 

Page #336:
---------------------------
## 297
...
...
**Trivarnika Achar.** For those who have taken vows, the Dev, like the Ganadharas, who are at the forefront, are said to be **Anarthadanda-Virati** when they are detached from the causes of sin, even within the limits of the directions, due to their being without purpose. || 92 ||

There are five types of **Anarthadanda Vrat**. They are: **Papopadeśa, Hinsa-Dana, Apadhyāna, Duḥśruti, and Pramāda-Caryā**. || 93 ||

Those who do not perform actions without purpose, are said to be **Anarthadanda** for these five: **Papopadeśa, Hinsa-Dana, Apadhyāna, Duḥśruti, and Pramāda-Caryā**. The meaning is that performing these five actions is **Anarthadanda**. || 93 ||

**Papopadeśa**.  Talking about **Tiryag-Vanijya, Klesha-Vanijya, Hinsa, Aarambha, Pralaṁbhana (cheating)**, etc., is called **Papopadeśa** which is **Anarthadanda**. || 94 ||

**Hinsa-Dana**. Giving **Parshu, Kṛpāṇa, Khanitra, Jvalana, Ayudha, Śṛṅga, Śaṅkalā** etc., which are the causes of violence, is called **Hinsa-Dana** by the wise, which is **Anarthadanda**. || 95 ||

**Apadhyāna**. Thinking about the death, imprisonment, or injury of others, or about the death, imprisonment, or injury of one's own wife, son, etc., is called **Apadhyāna** by the wise in the **Jina-Śāsana**, which is **Anarthadanda**. || 96 ||

**Duḥśruti**. Listening to scriptures that are contaminated by **Aarambha, Pari-graha, Sāhasa, Mithyā-tva, Dveṣa, Rāga, Mada, and Madana (lust)** is called **Duḥśruti**, which is **Anarthadanda**. || 97 ||

**Pramāda-Caryā**. Digging the earth, throwing water, lighting fire, moving air, cutting trees, walking, and making others walk without purpose, are all called **Pramāda-Caryā**, which is **Anarthadanda**. || 98 ||

**Anarthadanda-virati Vrata Aticara**

**Verse 99:**
Kandarpa, Kautkucya, Maukarya, Gati Sadhana, and without consideration, doing any action, these five are the Aticaras of Anarthadanda-virati Vrata. A person who is detached from Anarthadanda should abandon these.

**Verse 100:**
Counting the objects of the five senses, which are useful for the purpose, is the Bhogopabhoga-parimana Vrata, for the purpose of reducing the Raga-bhava.

**Bhogopabhoga Lakshana**

**Verse 101:**
Food, clothes, etc., which are the objects of the five senses, which are to be abandoned after enjoying once, are called Bhoga, and those which are enjoyed again and again are called Upabhoga.

**Special Abandonment in Bhogopabhoga-parimana Vrata**

**Verse 102:**
Those who have taken refuge in the feet of the Jinas should abandon the consumption of honey and meat for the sake of avoiding the killing of living beings, and abandon alcohol for the sake of avoiding carelessness.

**Verse 103:**
Things like ginger, radish, carrot, and butter, neem and ketaki flowers, which give less pleasure to the tongue and cause more harm to living beings, should also be abandoned.

**Meaning:**
Although the abandonment of alcohol, meat, etc., had already taken place during the time of the eight precious qualities, it is mentioned again here in the Bhogopabhoga Vrata. Therefore, one should understand that the abandonment of these things is the abandonment of Aticaras. Or, the repeated mention of abandonment is done so that the Vrata remains pure and the person who abandons it remembers it.

**Reason for Abandoning Five Udumbar**

**Verse 104:**
There are subtle and gross living beings in the Udumbar tree. Therefore, the Jinas have instructed to abandon the five Udumbar. 

Page #338:
---------------------------
## Trivarna Achar

**The Five Udumbara:** The five Udumbara trees are home to many microscopic and macroscopic stationary and mobile living beings. Therefore, to protect these beings, the Shrojindev has advised the renunciation of the five Udumbara trees. || 104 ||

**Renunciation of Fruit Consumption:** One who consumes juicy fruits mixed with the bodily fluids of living beings, their renunciation of meat is futile. **Meaning:** One should not consume fruits that contain living beings. || 105 ||

**The Limit of Filtered Water:** Even pure, filtered water becomes contaminated within two ghadi (48 minutes). Water heated for a day and night (24 hours) becomes contaminated after eight prahar (32 hours). Similarly, kanji (fermented rice water) becomes contaminated after it cools down. || 106 ||

**Water Contaminated by Sesame and Rice:** Water used to wash sesame and rice in a house where alms are received (called "Bhramaridhar") is considered contaminated and does not purify the mouth. Therefore, it is not considered fit for drinking. || 107 ||

**Method of Purifying Water:** Water can be purified by washing sesame and rice with cardamom, cloves, sandalwood, camphor, saffron, tender leaves of the palm tree, ash of the Khadir tree, and triphala powder. It can also be purified by heating it in fire. || 108 ||

**Contamination of Leather Vessels:** Two-sense, three-sense, four-sense, and five-sense living beings are born in water, ghee, etc., stored in leather vessels. Consuming these, as well as the aachar (pickles) of fruits like lime and mango, is considered a violation of the meat renunciation vow. || 109 ||

**Types of Shiksha Vrat:** The four types of Shiksha Vrat are: Deshavakashik, Samayik, Moshadhopavas, and Vaiyavritty.

**Note:** Although the transgressions of the remaining vows, following the vow of limiting food and drink, should have been mentioned here in order, they have not been included due to the nature of this text as a general collection. || 110 || 

Page #339:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

**Desavakashik Vrat**

The Desavakashik Vrat, one of the four Shikshavat vows, is a vow to reduce the size of one's territory daily, measured by time.  The great sages have defined the boundaries of this vow as one's home, street, village, field, river, forest, and yojana (a unit of distance).

**Samayik Vrat**

The Samayik Vrat is a vow to abstain from the five great sins (violence, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and attachment) for a specific period of time.  It is considered a vow of complete liberation from these sins.

**Proshadhopavas Vrat**

The Proshadhopavas Vrat is a vow to abstain from four types of food on the eighth and fourteenth days of a lunar fortnight.  This vow is observed with a pure and sincere intention.

**Vaiyavrit Vrat**

The Vaiyavrit Vrat is a vow to give generously to the great sages, who are the treasure houses of virtues, without expecting anything in return.  This vow is performed with great enthusiasm and devotion.  It also includes helping the sages by removing their difficulties, massaging their feet, and providing any other assistance that may be needed.

**Giving Donations**

Donations should be given with pure intentions and should be free from any selfish motives.  They should be given to those who are worthy of receiving them and who are free from the five great sins.

Darshan, Vrat, Samayik, and Proshdha Upavas, the characteristics of these four images have been mentioned earlier. Now the characteristics of Sachitta Tyag image are being mentioned.

The observance of the five vows and seven precepts without any transgression is the Vrat image, which has been mentioned earlier. The one who has attained the Samayik-Sheel, whose characteristics have been mentioned earlier, is the Samayik image in brief. And the one who has attained the Proshdha Upavas is the Proshdha Upavas image. Now the fifth image, Sachitta Tyag, is being mentioned. || 120 ||

The one who does not consume roots, fruits, vegetables, branches, leaves, tubers, flowers, and seeds, is the Sachitta Virat, the embodiment of compassion. || 121 ||

**129.** Just as there are four distinct varnas (Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra) mentioned in the seventh anga, Upasakadhyayana, based on the difference in actions, similarly, there are four ashramas (Brahmachari, Grihi, Vanaprastha, and Bhikshu) mentioned in the same anga based on the difference in actions.

**Characteristics of Upanaya Brahmachari:**

**130.** One who is dedicated to studying and practicing the sutras of Shravakachar and later enters the Grihastha dharma is an Upanaya Brahmachari. In other words, one who is initiated with the Yajnopavita sanskar, studies Upasakadhyayana shastra under a guru, remains a complete Brahmachari until the completion of his studies, and then accepts Grihastha dharma and performs marriage and other rituals, is an Upanaya Brahmachari.

## Composed by Somasen Bhattaraka

**145.** One who leaves home and goes to the Muni forest, accepts vows from the Guru, practices austerities, eats alms, and wears a Khandavastra (piece of cloth) or Kaupina (loincloth) is an excellent Shravaka.

**146-149.** Ashadhara says: There are two types of excellent Shravakas: Ksullaka and Ailaka. The Ksullaka sits and eats from his hand or a vessel. He goes to the Shravaka's house empty-handed. He stands in the courtyard of the Shravaka's house and requests alms, saying "May there be Dharma-laabha (benefit of Dharma)." Or, he silently shows his body to the giver and requests alms. He remains equanimous, free from attachment and aversion, whether he receives alms or not. He then leaves and goes to another house. If, during the time of begging alms, a Shravaka invites him to eat at his house, he should first eat whatever alms he received at the previous house and then eat the food at that Shravaka's house. If no one invites him to eat, he should beg enough alms to fill his stomach. If he finds Prasooka water (water for purification) at a Shravaka's house, he should sit there, purify the alms, and eat it.

**150.** The Ailaka Shravaka wears only a Kaupina, performs Pratima Yoga (meditation on the image of the Tirthankara) at night, practices Biracharya (heroic conduct), carries a Koca (staff) and Picchi (feather duster), and eats sitting with his hands folded.

**151.** **Special duties for Deshavirati (those who have renounced their home):** Deshavirati Shravakas do not have the right to practice Biracharya, eat by begging, perform Pratima Yoga daily, practice Trikala Yoga (meditation at three times a day), perform Yoga on top of a mountain in summer, under a tree in the rainy season, or on the banks of a river, sea, or in a courtyard in winter. They also do not have the right to study the Siddhanta Shastra (doctrine), Prayaschitta Shastra (penance), etc.

The first six of these eleven images are considered inferior, the next three are considered medium, and the final two are considered superior in the Jaina scriptures. || 152 ||
Having heard these teachings from the guru, the yajñopavita-wearing śrāvaka should, as far as possible, adopt these practices, which bring happiness in this world and the next. || 153 ||
After this, the dharma-minded boy should go home with music and other festivities, and honor all his family members with betel leaves for the sake of dharma. || 154 ||
The yajñopavita, as described by the great sages, is a symbol of the three jewels. It is pleasing to the mind and is worn by those who are devoted to dharma, artha, and kāma, for their happiness. || 155 ||
The study of knowledge should always be undertaken, for it is an ornament for the virtuous. This is what Somadev has said for the benefit of all. || 156 ||
Thus, these excellent vows have been described in accordance with the Jina-agama. Those who practice them are worthy of praise. They are like those who have crossed the ocean of samsara and attained the bliss of liberation. They are praised by Indra and other gods, great kings, and Somadev. || 157 ||
Thus ends the tenth chapter of the Śrīdharmarasikśāstra, which describes the three types of conduct, and which is called the Vratasvarūpakathana.

Having bowed to Jinesena Muni, I will describe the auspicious ceremony of marriage, according to the ancient tradition, for the benefit of worldly conduct. ||2||

**Qualities of the Bride:** The bride should be from a different gotra (lineage) but of the same jati (caste), free from disease, possessing excellent qualities, long-lived, endowed with virtues like knowledge and good character, and given by her father. The groom should marry such a bride. ||3||

**Qualities of the Groom:** The groom should also be virtuous, excellent, long-lived, free from disease, from a good family, righteous, and handsome. ||4||

**Virtues of the Groom:** Truthfulness, purity (non-greed), forgiveness, renunciation, wisdom, brilliance, compassion, self-control, humility, and politeness are the virtues that reside in beings. These should also be present in the groom. ||5|| 

Page #348:
---------------------------
A well-proportioned, strong body, radiance, brilliance, beauty, sweet speech, skill in arts, excellent family, excellent caste, age (long life), knowledge, family, appearance, wealth, character and masculinity (not impotent), these are the bodily qualities that should be present in a groom. || 6-7 ||

First, one should examine the groom's lifespan. Afterwards, it is appropriate to examine his qualities. For what is the use of the characteristics of a man who is without lifespan? || 8 ||

Similarly, knowing the auspicious and inauspicious qualities, one should proceed with the marriage. || 9 ||

A groom should marry a girl with auspicious qualities, knowing her auspicious and inauspicious qualities. || 9 ||

The fruit of a girl with inauspicious qualities:

A girl with inauspicious qualities, devoid of auspicious qualities, destroys her mother, father, brother, brother-in-law, and husband. || 10 ||

Signs to examine a girl:

One should examine the hands, feet, fingers, nails, lines on the palms, both knees, waist, navel, chest, middle of the abdomen, breasts, ears, both arms, chest, forehead, head, hair, body hair, voice, complexion, neck, and nose. || 11-13 ||

Auspicious and inauspicious qualities of a girl:

If her feet are equal in length, smooth, and firmly planted on the ground, and soft and reddish, then that girl is a homemaker. || 14 ||

**Meaning:** One should follow the customs of the place. These are not specific rules. In Somdevniti, the marriage with a maternal uncle's daughter is said to be dependent on the country and time. As stated, "Country and time are the basis of the relationship with a maternal uncle." Therefore, those who do not follow this relationship are not considered to be disregarding the scriptures. This statement is not a rule, but an indicator of suitability. Statements indicating suitability are not binding, meaning one is not obligated to follow them. || 37 ||

I give her with my body, mind, and speech, with joy and happiness.  Please accept her." (42-44)

**The father of the groom replies:** "I accept your daughter for my son today in the presence of all these people, for the growth of my lineage." (45)

**The father of the bride then announces the lineage and gotra of the bride and gives her to the father of the groom, along with betel nut, akshata (rice grains), and fruit.** He says, "I give my beautiful daughter to your son today.  Please arrange for the wedding expenses and auspicious items." (46-47)

Then, the bride's father, standing near the bride, should perform the Gotrocharan (declaration of lineage) with the Brahmanas, saying, "I, born in the [insert groom's lineage], the great-grandson of [insert name], the grandson of [insert name], the son of [insert name], give this bride, [insert bride's name], the great-granddaughter of [insert name], the granddaughter of [insert name], the daughter of [insert name], to [insert groom's name]. O Brahmanas, accept her."

In response, all the Brahmanas should say, "We all accept this bride." Then, all the virtuous people should recite auspicious verses like "Suprayukta." || 51-55 ||

**Panipidan - Pani-Pidan Vidhi**

The bride, chosen by you, who is righteous, prosperous, and fulfilling all three Purusharthas (goals of life), takes your hand with her own hands. This is called the Panipidan Vidhi.

Iti Gandhakshatapadanamaatraha.

This is the mantra for offering fragrance and akshata. After reciting this mantra, offer fragrance and akshata to everyone. Apply the fragrance on the forehead, both arms, neck, and heart. Place the akshata on the head.

**Method of tying the Tali:**

After seeing the Pole Star at night, honor the learned and distinguished relatives and the assembly. On the fourth day, after giving the groom and bride a grand bath and performing the Jinabhishek, puja, homa, etc., perform the ceremony called Tali Bandhan. It is as follows:

The golden tali, tied with a turmeric-dyed thread given by the groom, should enhance the beauty of the bride's main ornament. Recite the mantra "Om Etasyah Panigrihiityah" completely and tie the tali around the bride's neck. Perform this ceremony on the fourth day of the wedding. After that, give blessings by reciting the following mantra:

Tatah Indrasya Shachya Sambandho Yatha Ratya Smarasya Cha. Sambandhamala Sambandha Dampatyostanutaattaatha.

Just as Indra is connected to Shachi and Kamadeva to Rati, may this bond of the tali create a strong connection between the couple.

## Trivarnika Rituals

The Trivarnika rituals are performed with the offering of firewood, followed by the worship of the sacred fire. The groom, accompanied by the bride, should then receive blessings and visit his own city.  

After completing the remaining fire offerings, the final offering should be made with the mantra:

**"Om Ratnatrayarchanamayo Uttamahomabhutim, Yushmakam Avahatu Pavanadivyabhurtim. Pakhandabhumivjayaprabhava Vibhurtim, Trailokyarajyavishaya Param Vibhutim."**

This mantra signifies that the ashes from the fire, a result of the worship of the three jewels, will bestow upon you purity, divine blessings, victory over hypocrisy, and the ultimate wealth of ruling the three realms.

**Gold Offering Mantra:**

**"Hiranyagarbhasya Hiranyatejaso, Hiranyavatsarvasukhavahasya. Prasadataste'stu Hiranyagarbhata, Hiranyadanena Sukhi Bhava Tvam."**

This mantra signifies that by the grace of the Jina, who is like the golden womb, radiant with golden light, and the source of all happiness, you will become like the golden womb and attain happiness by giving gold.

**"Suvarnavisrananameva Chadya, Suvarna Labham Cha Hiranyakantim. Swarnathasaukhyam Parinayameta, Vadhuvarabhyam Niyatam Dadatu."**

This mantra signifies that this offering of gold will bring the bride and groom wealth, golden radiance, and happiness.

**"Hiranyavisrananameva Chadya, Hiranyalabham Cha Hiranyakantim. Hiranyagarbhopamaputrjata Vadhurabhyam Niyatam Dadatu."**

This mantra signifies that this offering of gold will bring the bride and groom wealth, golden radiance, and children who are like the golden womb.

After the offering of gold, the couple should remove their bracelets and perform a circumambulation of the village with great pomp. They should then enjoy milk, food, and other pleasures. Finally, they should return to their own village.

The wedding ceremony is now almost complete. The author then writes, "Atha Vishesh," indicating that he will now discuss a special topic that is generally accepted and does not contradict common opinion.

**Somasen Bhattaraka Composed -**
... After marriage, the couple should remain celibate for three nights. They should not engage in sexual intercourse or other such activities. Afterwards, they should sleep together, sit together, and eat together. The latter half of the verse also has this reading:
  They should sleep and sit on the ground. They should eat food without salt or alkali. ||172||
The groom should reside with his wife in his father-in-law's house.
Some say that this should be done on the fourth day. ||173||
Further, the author quotes the words of the Paramatma Smriti, writing "Atha Paramatmamrti Vachanam".
If any defects are found in the groom on the fourth day,
Then the wise say that the father should give the daughter to another man, even if she has already been given. ||174||
The fourth ritual, called "Paani-Pidan", or before the Saptapadi, if a defect in the form of a fall from caste, a low caste, or misconduct is found in the groom, then the father of the girl, even if she has been given in betrothal, should give her to another groom of a higher caste or with other good qualities. This is the opinion of the wise. So, it is said in the Yajnavalkya Smriti:
Even if she has been given, if a better groom comes,
The Mitakshara Commentary - If a groom comes who is superior to the previous groom in terms of knowledge, lineage, or other qualities, and the previous groom has committed a sin or is of bad character, then the daughter, even if she has been given, should be taken away. This should be understood before the Saptapadi.
The meaning of this is that if a better groom is found, who is superior in knowledge, lineage, caste, etc., to the first groom, with whom the betrothal has been done, and the first groom has fallen from caste or is guilty of misconduct, then the daughter, even if she has been given in betrothal, should not be given to the first groom. This rule should be understood before the Saptapadi. The words "Datta" and "Datva" etc. in this context have been interpreted by the commentators as "given in betrothal" or "given by word". For example:
He who takes away a daughter after giving her in betrothal is punishable by the king, and he should pay a fine with interest.
Commentary - He who takes away a daughter after giving her in betrothal by word is punishable by the king according to the law of property. This is in the absence of a reason for taking her away. If there is a reason, then the daughter, even if she has been given, should be taken away if a better groom comes. This is because the taking away is permitted. And whatever wealth has been spent by the groom or his relatives for the purpose of betrothal, that should be given back to the groom with interest by the father of the girl.
The meaning is that if the father of the girl gives his daughter in betrothal and then, without any reason, does not marry her to the groom, then the king should punish him according to his ability. But if there is a reason for not giving her, as per the saying "Dattaapi Hareth", etc., then he should not be punished. And whatever wealth has been spent by the groom for the purpose of betrothal, that should be given back to the groom with interest by the father of the girl. 

Page #376:
---------------------------
Trivarnikaachar. The expenses incurred in honoring one's family members are to be given to the donors of the daughter, the Varakas, for the benefit of all. Therefore, this meaning is not against the tradition of this world. But those who perform the fourth day ritual after the marriage is complete, their meaning is definitely against the tradition. ||174||

If the Pravara (lineage), Gotra (ancestral lineage), etc. of the groom and bride are the same or similar in the Varana ceremony before the union of the husband and wife, then some people say that the donor of the daughter should not give the promised daughter to that groom but should give her to a groom with a different Pravara, Gotra, etc. ||175||

In the Kali Yuga, one should not marry another woman while having one wife, this is the teaching of the sage Galava. But some people in some countries accept this teaching, not everyone everywhere. Or, in some countries, some people accept a second marriage even while having one wife, not in all countries.

Meaning: In the Naga community, the first wife is considered the Dharma Patni (righteous wife). The second wife is called the Rati Vardhini (pleasure wife). The first wife should be of the same caste, this is the teaching of Manu. From Manu's teaching, it is also clear that taking the hand of a woman of the same caste in the evening is the best and this first marriage is the Dharma Vivah (righteous marriage). After that, other marriages are Kamya Vivah (desirable marriage). Yajnavalkya's opinion is that one should not perform religious rites with a woman of a different caste while having a woman of the same caste. Among those of the same caste, the first wife should be appointed for religious rites, not the middle or the lowest. From this, it is clear that marrying a girl of the same caste first is the best and the Dharma Vivah, not the second. Therefore, Galava Rishi prohibits this second marriage. He does not accept the second Kamya Vivah. Some Brahmanas also accept two marriages as Dharma Vivah and prohibit the third marriage. Then it is possible that Galava Rishi also prohibits the second marriage. There is no surprise in this. And in the Vaishnava tradition, many acts are prohibited in the Kali Yuga. For example, if a husband dies and there is no son, then having a son from the brother-in-law, marrying a woman of a different caste, etc. Therefore,

1- The first wife should be the Dharma Patni, the second the Rati Vardhini. It is seen that the best result is obtained in that. ||2- The best for the twice-born is a woman of the same caste for marriage. But for those who are inclined towards desire, these are the successive wives. ||3- While having a woman of the same caste, one should not perform religious rites with a woman of a different caste. Among those of the same caste, the eldest should be appointed for religious rites, not the others. ||4- Those who have completed their Brahmacharya (celibacy) and have a wife, they should not marry a second or third wife, this is what the Dharma Shastras say. ||5- The birth of a child from a widow by the brother-in-law. ||6- The marriage of daughters of different castes by the twice-born. ||

These are not to be done in the Kali Yuga. 

Page #377:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**176.**  
Somasen Bhattaraka has written and confirmed that Galava Rishi, having a wife of the same caste, prohibits a second marriage in Kaliyuga. However, those who interpret this verse as allowing remarriage of women are completely wrong. Because this interpretation goes against the Brahman tradition itself.

**177.**
If the groom has gone to another country after the engagement, one should wait for three years for his arrival. If he does not come within three years, the girl should be given to another groom. In the original manuscript, below this verse, it is written "iti parmatasmrti vachanam".

**178.**
After the marriage, the groom should go to his house with his wife. If the house is in another village, he should go by some conveyance.

**179.**
The time for the bride to enter the house is from the day of the marriage to the sixteenth day. During these sixteen days, she should enter the house on even dates, not on odd dates. The fifth day is auspicious on odd dates. Therefore, the fifth day is also considered good for entering the house. Do not enter the house on any other odd day.

**180.**
If the bride cannot enter the groom's house within the first sixteen days due to some reason, then she should enter on the fifth year, or the seventh year, or the ninth year, on an auspicious day according to the astrologers, when the moon is in the constellation of Shani. The next verse indicates that the first year is also considered good for the first entry. In some places, the third year is also considered.

**181.**
The bride's entry into the house is auspicious on the 4th, 8th, and 12th days of the marriage. In the month, it is auspicious on the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th days. In the year, the 2nd, 4th, 6th, and 8th days are inauspicious. The 5th, 7th, and 9th days are considered auspicious by others. The bride's entry into the house should be complete with auspicious intentions and wealth.

**Note:** The phrase "panchaastamukhhya pare" in the verse seems incorrect. Perhaps it should be "panchaadimuhkhya pare", which would make the verse consistent with verse 180. Repetition is not considered in the collection of verses.

This text explains the auspicious days for the bride's entry into the groom's house. The auspicious days are the fourth, sixth, eighth, and tenth days after the wedding day. These days are considered prosperous and fulfill all desires. The second, fourth, sixth, eighth, and tenth months are also auspicious. The fifth month is considered to be beneficial for longevity. The second, fourth, sixth, and eighth years are inauspicious. || 181 ||

**Devotthapan:**

One should perform Devotthapan (waking up the deities) on auspicious days. However, the sixth day is not auspicious. Similarly, the fifth and seventh days, along with other odd days, are not considered auspicious. || 182 ||

**Mandap Removal:**

The mandap should be removed before the sixteenth day after the pratiṣṭhā (foundation laying ceremony). Similarly, in a wedding, the mandap should be removed before the sixteenth day after the wedding day. || 183 ||

**Bride's Residence:**

The bride should not reside in her husband's house during the first pūpa (ceremony), the first apād (period), or during an adhimāsa (extra month). She should also not reside in her father's house during the first Chaitra (month). || 184 ||

**Lagna Pratighāt (Inauspicious Lagna):**

If a member of the groom's lineage dies after the engagement ceremony, the wedding should not be performed before the specified time. If the wedding is performed before the specified time, the bride will become a widow. This rule applies to the groom's lineage up to the third and fourth generations. || 185 ||

**Death of Relatives:**

If the groom's or bride's mother, father, paternal uncle, or sibling dies, the wedding should not be performed before the specified time. || 186 ||

**Somasen Bhattaraka Composed**

After performing the Shanti ritual as prescribed, then, having given the promise, the marriage is performed. || 188 ||

A father should not remarry for one year after the death of his wife, a mother should not remarry for six months after the death of her husband, a former wife should not remarry for three months after the death of her husband, a son or brother should not remarry for one and a half months (many texts say "half a month" instead of "one and a half months"), and other sapinda gotra members should not remarry for one month after the death of their relative. After the expiry of the above mentioned period, the marriage should be performed again after performing the Shanti ritual and giving the promise, according to the above mentioned marriage rules. || 187-188 ||

One should not bathe with oil, perform til-mishra rituals, go behind the deceased (i.e., go to cremate the dead body), or visit previously unseen tirthas and devatas for one year from the day of the marriage. || 189 ||

After the marriage of a son, one should not marry off a daughter before six months, and the bride should not enter the house before the daughter is sent to her in-laws. Meaning: After the marriage of a son, the marriage of a daughter should not take place before six months, and the marriage of a son should not take place before six months after the marriage of a daughter. || 190 ||

One should not perform the chaulakarma, upanayana ceremony, or marriage of multiple sons born to the same mother in the same year. || 191 ||

One should not marry off a daughter within three seasons (six months) after the marriage of a son. Also, one should not perform the chaulakarma after the marriage. This rule applies to sons and daughters born to the same mother. If the year is the same, this verse should be understood as referring to the six-month rule, but if the year is different, it should not be understood as such. This is what we are saying. || 192 ||

If the marriage takes place in Phalguna, then the upanayana ceremony should be performed in Chaitra, even if the year is different. There is no need to delay the ceremony for six months due to the difference in the year. Meaning:

## Trivarnika Achar

**One year rule:**

If two children (either both sons, both daughters, or one son and one daughter) are born to the same mother within one year, they should not be married within six months of each other. However, if the children are born in different years, they can be married within six months of each other. Similarly, within one year, the "Choulkarm" ceremony should not be performed within six months of the marriage of a son or sons. If the ceremonies are performed in different years, there is no harm. 

**Note:** Repetition in the verses should not be considered as these verses are composed by different Rishis and are collected here. Therefore, repetition is natural.

**Marriage of daughters:**

If two daughters are born to the same mother, it is considered a fault to marry the younger daughter before the elder daughter. However, if the daughters are born to different mothers, there is no fault in marrying the younger daughter first.

**Note:** Marrying the younger daughter before the elder daughter is called "Parivedan".

**Menstruation before marriage:**

If a girl becomes menstruated before marriage, her brothers and parents will go to hell.

**Note:** The age of menstruation for girls is twelve years. Therefore, they should be married before twelve years. Although some girls may menstruate after twelve years, many girls menstruate at twelve years. Therefore, marriage should be performed within this period.

**Consequences of menstruation before marriage:**

If a girl becomes menstruated before marriage, she should be considered a Shudra or a menstruating woman. Her husband should also be considered a Shudra's husband or a menstruating woman's husband.

**Second marriage:**

If a woman does not have children within ten years of her first marriage, her husband can remarry. If a woman only has daughters and no sons, her husband can remarry after twelve years. If a woman has children but they do not survive, her husband can remarry after fifteen years. If a woman is childless and unpleasant, her husband can remarry immediately.

**Note:** "Unpleasant" also means "adulterous".

**Chapter 198**

**Somasen Bhattaraka's Composition**

A woman who is diseased, barren, insane, or has ceased to menstruate, even if she is of good character, is to be abandoned for the sake of enjoyment, but not for the sake of Dharma. 

**Meaning:** One should not engage in sexual relations with such women, but there is no harm in performing religious duties with them.

**Chapter 199**

A husband should not abandon his wife who is beautiful, fertile, fortunate, dear to him, and a companion in religious duties.

**Chapter 200**

When a man wishes to remarry after the death of his wife, it is considered auspicious to do so in an odd year, counting from the year of her death.  Marriage in an even year is considered inauspicious.

**Alternative Opinion:**

**Chapter 201**

A man should remarry in the first year after the death of his wife. If he cannot do so in the first year, he should remarry in the second year. However, marriage in an odd month is considered auspicious, as stated by the sages like Gautama.

**Chapter 202**

If a wife dies without bearing a son, it is considered auspicious for her husband to remarry in an even year or an even month.

**Chapter 203**

If a wife who has borne children dies, a Brahmin or a Vaishya should not remarry in the first year.  Remarriage in the first year after the death of a wife is considered inauspicious for them.

**Chapter 204**

**Third Marriage**

If a man marries a third wife without performing the "Arka Vivah" (a ritual performed before marrying a third wife), the third wife will become a widow and her daughter will be considered a widow. Therefore, one should be wise in such matters. 

Page #382:

Trivarnikaachar. _The first married woman of the same caste is the Dharmapatni. And the second married woman is the Bhogapatni. This has been said before. Having these two wives, one should not marry a third. If perchance one does marry a third, then one should not do so without an Arka-vivah, because without an Arka-vivah, the third wife attains the Vaidhvy Diksha. Therefore, wise men should marry a third wife only after performing an Arka-vivah. 204 ||

## Chapter Twelve

**Salutation to the Lord of the Jinas, who is beyond karma and yet active.**

**I will now explain the specific actions, according to the scriptures and their meaning.** (1)

**The one whose body is the color of gold, and who has described the four varnas (Brahmana, Kshatriya, Vaishya, Shudra), and who has been the master of the six divisions (of the universe), is praised as Kunthunatha, the Tirthankara.** (2)

**The action of gaining a varna (status).** Thus, a man who has properly performed the marriage ceremony and who follows the rules of household life, should perform the action of gaining a varna, which is known throughout the world, for the benefit of his own dharma, qualities, and community.** (3)

**Even though he has married a suitable woman, he is still dependent as long as he lives in his father's house. Therefore, the action of gaining a varna is performed for the fulfillment of his household dharma.** (4)

**The nature of the action of gaining a varna.** A man who has obtained wealth and food, with the permission of his father, who is the master of the house, and who is able to support himself, and who has separated from his father's house, is said to have gained a varna. **Meaning:** The action of gaining a varna is to separate from one's father with his blessings and to follow the household dharma.** (5)

**Having performed the rituals of the Siddha and the Archanas, and having worshipped the supreme devotees in order, the father should give his son his wealth, with the witness of the chief good men.** (6) 

Page #384:
---------------------------
## Trivarnika Achar

The father of that man, should give him his share of the property in the presence of the main dignitaries, after worshipping the Siddha-Pratima and properly honoring the Shravakas. || 6 ||

Having received the wealth, he should stay at home separately, and perform the duties of a householder, with charity and worship, for the sake of his own happiness. || 7 ||

Just as we have diligently earned pure fame and dharma with the wealth given by our father, so too should you earn dharma and fame with the wealth given by your father. || 8 ||

Thus, the father should instruct his son and appoint him in the Varna-Lam ritual. And the son, being full of good conduct, should perform his dharma. Thus, the Varna-Labh ritual is performed. || 7-9 ||

## Kula-Choka Swaroop

Worship of the Jina-Nayaka, service to the Guru and Upadhyaya, two types of restraint (Pran-Samyama and Indriya-Samyama), performance of twelve types of Tapas, and giving four types of charity - these six things, performed according to the rules, are considered auspicious and good Varna-Labh ritual. The conduct of a person who has attained this is called Kula-Charya. Meaning - Performing these six actions, like worship of the deity, is called Kula-Charya or Kula-Dharma. This ritual is performed after the Varna-Labh ritual. || 10 ||

## Grihi-Shita Kriya Swaroop

After attaining Kula-Charya, the householder, being firm in dharma, should accept Grihi-Shita through scriptural knowledge, the ritual of marriage, livelihood, and auspicious mantras, and with pure fame through various literary works, desiring beautiful fame, while maintaining his own purity and elevation. || 11 ||

**Third, accept the state of being a householder, i.e., the ownership of a home, while progressing towards being free from faults.**  **Meaning:**  After the ritual of family discussion, accepting the ownership of a home as per the above statement is the act of becoming a householder.  || 11 ||

**The Nature of the Act of Tranquility**

Having obtained a suitable son, who is in accordance with your wishes, who is a treasure trove of virtues, who is capable of bearing the burden of your home, and who is adorned with auspicious signs, entrust him with the burden of your household.  You yourself, free from desire for worldly pleasures, should engage in self-study and austerity.  This is called the act of tranquility.  **Meaning:**  Entrust the burden of your household to your worthy son, and you yourself, while residing in the home, should engage in self-study, vows, and fasts, and renounce the desire for worldly pleasures.  In this way, spend as much time as you wish in your home peacefully.  This is called the act of tranquility.  || 12 ||

**1**

**The Act of Renouncing the Home**

Having greatly honored yourself in the household, and having achieved your purpose, you should be eager to renounce the home.  This is the method of renouncing the home, which should be performed in front of those who have achieved their purpose.  || 13 ||

Calling together all those who are agreeable, and with them as witnesses, declare everything to your son.  Place the family lineage in his care, saying, "This is to be protected by you, my dear son, in my absence!"  || 14 ||

The wealth that has been accumulated in three ways is ours, and therefore it should be used.  One part should be given for the work of Dharma, the second part for the expenses of your own home,  || 15 ||

and the third part should be considered for the equal distribution among your siblings.  Again, when dividing all the wealth, you should release your sons from all obligations, saying, "You are all free!"  || 16 ||

The eldest son himself should accept the same vow as ours, and should be instructed in the scriptures, the conduct, the rituals, and the mantras.  || 17 ||

The family tradition and the teachings of the Guru should always be followed.  In this way, the eldest son, who is the best disciple, should renounce the home, abandoning the delusion-born vices.  || 18 ||

When one is ready to accept initiation, he should renounce his own home.  He should abandon the mind that is attached to desires and should dwell in contemplation of Dharma for some days.  || 19 ||

Page #386:
---------------------------
## Trivarnika Achar

The householder, considering himself fulfilled in the household, attains peace. When the householder is ready to leave home, this act is called Grihatyag. Before performing this act, he should worship the Siddha pratima. Then, he should call together men of good character and, in their presence, instruct his eldest son as follows:

"My son, you should diligently follow the Dharma, actions, and rituals that have been passed down to us through our lineage. You should use the wealth we have divided into three parts as follows: one part for religious activities, another part for the sustenance of the family, and the third part to be equally distributed among your brothers. And, my son, you are the eldest, so you should take good care of our lineage. You are well-versed in the scriptures, the means of livelihood, household activities, and mantras related to these actions. Therefore, you should diligently follow the family tradition, worship the Guru daily, and pay homage to the Devas and the Aptus."

After instructing his eldest son in this way, he should renounce the attachments born of delusion, namely, the attachment to home, family, etc. Then, the householder should leave his home to receive initiation, abandoning the desire for work and wealth, and dwell in contemplation of Dharma for many days. This is called the Grihatyag act. || 13-19 ||

## The Method of Receiving Initiation

Having observed the causes of detachment, he should leave his home with a sense of detachment. With a heart filled with hope for liberation, he should approach the Guru, who is the savior. || 20 ||

He should bow to the Guru with pure mind, speech, and body, and receive the Jin-diksha, as taught by the Jina Bhagwan. Then, he should worship the Guru and, understanding the nature of the vows from his mouth, he should observe them. || 20-21 ||

## The Names of the Vows

There are five Mahavratas, five Samitis, and three Guptis. Thus, there are thirteen types of Charitra. || 22 ||

## The Names of the Five Mahavratas

The five vows are: non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, non-possession, and celibacy. These five vows are for the attainment of liberation and happiness. || 23 ||

**Chapter 27-30**

**65**
Those who do not follow the *antarayas* (inner restraints), the foolish and wicked,
Where is their Dharma? Where is their compassion? Where is their inner purity and outer cleanliness?
**Meaning:** Those who do not follow the *antarayas* have no Dharma, no compassion, and no inner or outer purity. **65**

**66**
*Saucha* (cleanliness) is the root of Dharma, which leads to compassion for all beings.
Through purity and compassion, the path to liberation is attained. **66**

**Food suitable for a Muni**

**67**
Just as at midday, one should eat food that is pure and wholesome,
For the sustenance of the body, not for the sake of enjoyment. **67**

**68**
Food contaminated with nine types of faults, arising from the mind, speech, and body,
Through actions, words, and approvals, is not fit for a Muni to consume. **68**

**69-71**
**1.** After performing the *Samayika* (meditation) at midday with joy,
Having bowed to the Jina in the east, one should proceed slowly for food.
**70.** Holding the *picchi* (feather duster) and *kamandalu* (water pot) in the left hand,
And placing the right hand on the shoulder, one should walk with a pure gait to the *Shravaka's* (lay follower's) house.
**71.** Arriving at the *Shravaka's* courtyard, the noble Muni should stand there,
And with purity, recite the five prostrations nine times. **69-71**

**Method of offering alms**

**72.** Seeing him, the devotee should quickly and with devotion accept him,
And wash his *ankshi* (bowl) with pure water and offer him food. **72**

## English Translation:

**356**

Food prepared with the intention of giving it to Nagas, Yakshas, other deities, heretics outside the Jain faith, and the poor is called **auddeshik aahar**. Such food should not be consumed by the Munishwaras. || 80 ||

**Saadhik Dosha:**

When a large amount of food is prepared for oneself, seeing the Munis coming, and then some of it is given to them, this is called **Saadhik** or **Adhyadhi Dosha** by the wise. || 81 ||

**Meaning:** When dal-bhaat (lentils and rice) is being cooked for oneself, or water is being heated, and then seeing the Munis coming, some dal, rice, or water is added to the existing pot for them, this is **Saadhik Dosha**. || 81 ||

**Pooti Dosha:**

Cooking food in a kitchen or vessel with the intention of giving it first to the Sadhus and then to others is called **Pooti Dosha**. || 82 ||

**Meaning:** The five types of **Pooti Dosha** mentioned in this verse are not clearly understood. In other texts, **Pooti Dosha** is described as follows: Food that is meant for consumption but is associated with non-consumption due to mental attachment is considered to be affected by **Pooti Dosha**. It has five types: **Ghani**, **Udukhala** (mortar), **Darvi** (winnowing basket), **Bhajan** (vessel), and **Gandha** (smell). Cooking food in this kitchen with the intention of giving it first to the Munis and then to others is **Ranthani** type of **Pooti Dosha**. Grinding in this mortar and not giving it to the Munis before giving it to others is **Udukhala** type of **Pooti Dosha**. Similarly, **Darvi**, **Bhajan**, and **Gandha** Doshas should be understood. Although the food is meant for consumption, it is associated with non-consumption, hence it is **Dosha**. || 82 ||

**Mishra Dosha:**

Food prepared with the intention of giving it to the Munis, along with heretics and householders, even if it is meant for consumption, is affected by **Mishra Dosha**. || 83 ||

**Kaalaheen Dosha:**

Giving a gift before or after the time it was intended to be given is **Praabhootik Dosha**. || 84 ||

**Meaning:** There are two types of **Praabhootik Dosha**: **Baadar** (gross) and **Sookshma** (subtle). Each of these has two types: **Kaalahaani** (loss of time) and **Kaalavrudhi** (increase of time). Giving a gift before or after the intended time, day, month, or year is **Kaalahaani**.

## Awwamat

**Trivarnika Achar:** Giving food with defects like **Badar** and **Prabhutic** is considered a fault. For example, if one intends to give charity on Shukla Ashtami but gives it on Shukla Panchami, it is **Divas Hani** (loss of day). Similarly, if one intends to give on Shukla Panchami but gives it on Shukla Ashtami, it is **Divas Vriddhi** (increase of day). If one intends to give in the Shukla Paksha of Chaitra but gives it in the Krishna Paksha, it is **Paksha Hani** (loss of fortnight). If one intends to give in the Krishna Paksha of Chaitra but gives it in the Shukla Paksha, it is **Paksha Vriddhi** (increase of fortnight). If one intends to give in the Chaitra month but gives it in the Phalguna month, it is **Masa Hani** (loss of month). If one intends to give in the Phalguna month but gives it in the Chaitra month, it is **Masa Vriddhi** (increase of month). Similarly, if one intends to give in the next year but gives it in the current year, it is **Varsha Hani** (loss of year). If one intends to give in the current year but gives it in the next year, it is **Varsha Vriddhi** (increase of year). Also, exceeding the time of meals is a **Sukshma Prabhutic** fault. For example, if one intends to give charity in the afternoon but gives it in the morning, or if one intends to give in the evening but gives it in the afternoon, it is **Samaya Hani** (loss of time). If one intends to give in the morning but gives it in the afternoon, or if one intends to intend to give in the afternoon but gives it in the evening, it is **Samaya Vriddhi** (increase of time). Giving food by causing such loss or increase in time is a **Prabhutic** fault. Doing so causes distress to the giver, harms many beings, and requires a lot of effort to start again. Therefore, it is considered a fault. || 84 ||

**Bali Dosha:**  Especially for the purpose of the journey of the **Sanayatas** (Jain ascetics) and **Prabhutas** (Jain monks), offering food after performing worship to **Yaksha** and other deities is considered **Bali Dosha**. || 85 || ...  Offering food with the intention of the **Sanayatas** coming to our house is **Bali Dosha**. || 85 ||

**Nyasta Dosha:**  Food that is taken out from the vessel in which it was cooked and placed in another vessel, either in one's own house or in another's house, is called **Nyasta Dosha** by the **Agama** experts.  Meaning: Such food should not be taken by **Munishwaras** (Jain monks). Because the giver of the food performs such an act out of fear of others, therefore, there are faults like opposition, etc., in it. || 86 ||

**Praadushkar Dosha:** ... "Moving the vessels of food, etc., from one place to another, and even lighting a lamp..." || 87 || ...  This is considered **Praadushkar Dosha** and should be avoided by those seeking good fortune. Meaning: There are two types of **Praadushkar Dosha**: one is **Samkraman** (transfer) and the other is **Prakash** (light). Moving the food vessels from one place to another upon seeing the **Sanayatas** coming to the house is **Samkraman Dosha**.  And cleaning the vessels with ashes, etc., lighting a lamp, spreading out the vessels, etc., is called **Prakash** (light).

## Trivarnika Achar 1..
359

If someone is stopped in the middle of giving food, then that food should not be given to the monks. Even if someone gives it despite being prohibited, that food is considered to be associated with the great sin of "Nishedha" (prohibition). 

**Meaning:** There are six types of prohibited food: Vyaktashwar, Avyaktashwar, Vyakt-Avyaktashwar, Vyakt-Anishwar, Avyakt-Anishwar, and Vyakt-Avyakt-Anishwar. If someone is stopped in the middle of giving food, which falls under any of these categories, then that food is associated with the sin of "Nishedha". Such food should not be taken by the Munishwars, because it is considered to have defects like opposition, etc. || 91-92 ||

**Abhihit Dosha (Defect of Being Mentioned):**

> From which house, other than the houses in the row, or from the eighth house onwards in the row of houses, the food is brought and received, that food is considered to be associated with the Abhihit Dosha. || 93 ||

**Meaning:** When taking food, if another person brings food from their house and offers it with devotion, then the monk can take the food that comes from the house where they are taking food, or from the houses in the row, up to three or seven houses. There is no fault in this. But, food brought from the eighth house onwards, or from any house outside the row of three or seven houses, is associated with the Abhihit Dosha. Such food should not be taken by the monks. || 93 ||

**Udbhinna Dosha (Defect of Extraction):**

> If the mouth of a vessel is sealed with mud, lac, etc., and ghee, jaggery, sugar, etc., are extracted from it after removing the mud, lac, etc., then it is considered to be the Udbhinna Dosha. || 94 ||

**Aachchhadya Dosha (Defect of Concealment):**

> Seeing the restrained ones, if someone gives food out of fear of the king, thief, etc., then that is called the Aachchhadya Dosha. || 95 ||

**Meaning:** Seeing the restrained ones, if a king or someone like a king, or a thief, etc., threatens a householder, saying, "Give food to these monks who have come, otherwise we will take away your wealth, or loot you, or drive you out of the city," and then the householder gives food out of fear, then this is called the Aachchhadya Dosha. || 95 ||

**Malarohaṇa Dosha (Defect of Climbing):**

> If food is taken from a second house, after climbing up from a lower house, etc., then it is considered to be the Malarohaṇa Dosha. || 96 ||

**Note:** There is another version of the 9th verse:

> Hearing the fear of the king, etc., the monks remain silent. Whatever is given to them secretly, is called the Aachchhadya Dosha. ||

"Taking food from the second or third floor of a house by climbing up a ladder, a staircase, or a ramp is a *Malarohaṇa* fault. Meaning: Taking food from a place higher than the food-giving place by climbing up a ladder, staircase, or ramp is a *Malarohaṇa* fault. In this, the food giver's falling down, etc., is seen as a danger; therefore, it is a fault. In this way, sixteen *Udgaman* faults are said. Next, sixteen *Utpādan* faults are said." || 96 || *Dhāni* Fault |

*Dhātrī* Fault | Bathing children, adorning them with ornaments, giving them milk, playing with them, putting them to sleep - doing these five actions oneself or giving instructions for these five actions and then taking food is a *Dhātrī* fault. Meaning: Taking food through the five actions of bathing, etc., done by a *Dhātrī* is a *Dhātrī* fault. || 97-98 ||

*Bhṛtya* Fault | Taking food after conveying news from one's own village and country to another village and another country is a fault called *Bhṛtya* or messenger. Meaning: If a monk is going to another village or another country by water, land, or air, and a householder sees him going and says, "O Bhattaraka! Please take this message for me," and the monk takes that message and delivers it to the person to whom it was sent, and the person in that other village or country is very pleased and gives the monk food, and the monk takes that food, then that food is considered to be tainted with the *Dūta* fault. Therefore, monks should not take food produced by messenger work. Because taking food through messenger work brings impurity to the Jain religion. || 99 ||

*Nimitta* Fault | Taking food produced by these eight causes: *vyañjana*, *aṅga*, *svara*, *chheda*, *bhauma*, *antarikṣa*, *lakṣaṇa*, and *svapna* is a *Nimitta* fault. Meaning: *Vyañjana* refers to things like sesame seeds and ink. *Aṅga* refers to the limbs of the body, like hands and feet. *Svara* refers to sound. *Chheda* refers to wounds caused by things like swords. *Bhauma* refers to the earth splitting. *Antarikṣa* refers to the rising and setting of the sun, moon, etc. *Lakṣaṇa* refers to things like *nandikāvarta*, *padma*, and *chakra*. *Svapna* refers to seeing things like riding an elephant, sitting in an airplane, or riding a buffalo. Seeing these eight causes and then taking food from another person is a *Nimitta* fault. 

Page #400:
---------------------------
## Trivarna Achar:

**36.1**

**Taking food after praising the giver is considered a fault.** This fault arises because it involves the vices of savoring the taste, humility, etc. || 100 ||

**Vanipak-Dosha:**  It is a Vanipak-Dosha to take food after telling the giver that giving to the needy, the blind, the lame, the crippled, the Brahmins who eat honey and other delicacies, the Papadis who live by initiation, and the crows, brings merit. || 101 ||

**Meaning:** If a giver asks a Sadhu, "Maharaj, does giving food to a dog, feeding the blind, the lame, the crippled, and other suffering beings, feeding Brahmins who eat honey and other delicacies, feeding Papadis who live by initiation, and feeding crows bring merit?" The Sadhu replies, "Yes, it does." This is called Vanipak-Dosha. The implication is that taking food after flattering the giver is a Vanipak-Dosha, because it reveals humility in the Sadhu. || 101 ||

**Jeevanak-Dosha:**  Taking food after stating one's caste purity, family purity, austerity, and craft is a fault called Jeevanak-Dosha. This involves hiding the power of semen, humility, etc., and is therefore a fault. || 102 ||

**Krodha-Dosha and Lobha-Dosha:**

Taking food after getting angry is considered Krodha-Dosha. Taking food after showing greed is considered Lobha-Dosha. || 103 ||

**Purva-Stuti and Patha-Stuti Dosha:**

Praising the giver before taking food, saying, "You are like Indra, like the Moon," etc., is a Purva-Stuti Dosha. Praising the giver after taking food is a Patha-Stuti Dosha. || 104 ||

**Meaning:**  Praising the giver before receiving the donation, saying, "You are a great giver, you are a Yaso-dhar, your fame is heard everywhere in the world," is a Purva-Stuti Dosha.  Taking food after saying, "You were a great giver before, how did you forget to give now?" is also a Purva-Stuti Dosha.  Praising the giver after receiving the donation, saying, "You are famous in the world, you are a great giver, we have heard of your fame," is a Patha-Stuti Dosha.  Such actions are a fault in the conduct of a Namacharya. They also reveal stinginess, and therefore are both faults. || 104 ||

##  Chapter Twelve: The Five Stages of the Path, Including the Acquisition of the Right Faith, etc.

**The Code of Conduct for the Four Asramas**

Thus, the Dharma, as spoken by the Munis, is the means to liberation. In this treatise, I have briefly described the code of conduct for the four Asramas. (121)

**The Five Stages of the Path**

In this twelfth chapter, the different aspects of Dharma, which lead to the fruit of liberation and happiness, have been described. These are: the acquisition of the right faith, family life, householdership, peace of mind, renunciation of the household, and initiation. Those who are blessed and perform these actions are worshipped by the gods and kings. (122)

The saints preach Dharma. Blessed are those who follow their teachings. They are worshipped by the gods and kings. Somaseṇa Sūri desires their virtues. (123)

Thus ends the twelfth chapter of the Dharma-Rasika-Śāstra, composed by Bhatṭāraka Śrī Somaseṇa, which deals with the description of the five stages of the path, including the acquisition of the right faith, etc. (124)

## Chapter Thirteen

**By Somasen Bhattaraka**

I bow to Shanti Nath, the saviour, the giver of peace and happiness, the sun of the universe, who, by the power of his past merits, established his kingdom over all of Bharat with the wheel of Dharma. After attaining Diksha, he shattered the impurities of karma with the wheel of meditation, and with pure knowledge, he enlightened the worthy souls in the Samavasarana for the sake of liberation. ||1||

I, the author of this text, bow to the Siddha, the supreme being, free from the stains of karma, the beloved of liberation, endowed with the qualities of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct. I will now clearly explain the chapter on the two types of mourning rituals: the mourning for the dead and the mourning for birth. ||2||

For Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, and Vaishyas, the performance of mourning rituals is essential. Without observing these rituals, their actions, such as worship of the gods, will not lead to liberation. ||3||

**Types of Mourning Rituals**

There are four types of mourning rituals: menstrual, childbirth, death, and the mourning caused by contact with these three. The first is the menstrual mourning ritual. ||4||

**Types of Menstrual Mourning Rituals**

The menstrual mourning ritual is known by the names of Raj, Pushpa, and Ritu. It is of two types for women: natural and unnatural. ||5||

Second opinion: If a woman of prime youth becomes menstruating again before sixteen days, she becomes pure by merely taking a bath. Meaning: If a woman becomes menstruating again before sixteen days after her previous menstruation, she does not need to observe three days of impurity. She is considered pure by merely taking a bath, this is the second opinion. || 12 ||
If a menstruating woman experiences menstruation again before eighteen days, she is pure. If she becomes menstruating on the eighteenth day, she becomes pure after two days. After two days, she becomes pure by taking a bath. And if she becomes menstruating on the nineteenth day or later, she becomes pure after three days. || 13 ||
A woman of full youth who becomes menstruating again on the eighteenth day, although she becomes pure after observing two days of impurity, is fit for performing religious rites and ancestral rites on the third day. Because she is menstruating, she is impure. || 14 ||
If a woman who has taken a bath becomes menstruating again before eighteen days, she is not considered impure. This is the third opinion. || 15 ||
...
...
The conduct of a menstruating woman: A woman in her period should sleep on a clean bed. She should stay in a secluded place, avoiding contact with healthy people. || 16 ||
She should remain silent, and not be devoid of religious duties. She should protect her body with garlands of jasmine, Madhavi creeper, and white jasmine. || 17 ||
She should avoid eating food with a strong taste for three days. She should abstain from applying collyrium, unguents, perfumes, and ornaments. || 18 ||
She should not look at a deity, a guru, a king, her own reflection in a mirror, or her family deity. She should not speak to them equally. || 19 ||

## Trivarnika Achar

**Verse 20:** A woman in her menstrual cycle should sleep on a mat or a seat made of straw, in a secluded place, not touching any man or woman, remaining silent, not engaging in discussions about religion. She should hold a garland of Malati, Madhavi, or Kunda flowers in her hand, protecting her vows completely. She should eat once every three days, avoiding buttermilk, milk, yogurt, and ghee. She should not apply kajal to her eyes, massage her body with oil, or apply perfumes. She should not wear flower garlands, adorn herself, or see deities, gurus, or kings. She should not look at her reflection in a mirror, nor should she see or speak to her family deity. She should not sleep under a tree or on a bed, and should not sleep during the day. She should remember the Panchanamaskara mantra in her heart (not uttering it aloud). She should eat from a leaf plate, a wooden plate, or a copper or brass plate. She should not eat from a bronze plate. If she does, the plate must be purified by fire.

**Verse 21:** A woman in her menstrual cycle should bathe on the fourth day, before the time of the cows going out to graze. The time from three hours before sunrise to three hours after sunrise is called the "Gosarg" time, which is the time when cows are released to graze in the forest.

**Verse 23:** After bathing on the fourth day, a woman in her menstrual cycle becomes pure enough to cook and eat. However, she becomes pure enough to perform worship, serve a guru, and perform homa on the fifth day.

**Verse 24:** If two women in their menstrual cycle talk to each other, it is a great sin. Therefore, women in their menstrual cycle should not talk to each other.

**Verse 25:** If two women in their menstrual cycle talk to each other, they can be purified by each performing a fast. They should not live together or eat from the same plate. 

Page #409:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

**Composed by Somasen Bhattaraka.** If two women of the same caste fast for two days and eat together in one line, they become pure after three days of fasting. This atonement should be understood in the context of women of the same caste who are menstruating, as the atonement for women of different castes is mentioned later.

**The atonement for two women of the same caste touching each other is as follows:**

**1.** If two women of the same caste who are menstruating touch each other, both of them should purify themselves by bathing, fasting, and taking scented water.

**25.** If a menstruating woman of a higher caste interacts with a menstruating woman of a lower caste, the higher caste woman should purify herself by fasting for one more day than the atonement mentioned above.

**26.** If menstruating women of different castes (varna) interact with each other, sit together, and eat in one line, the higher caste woman should purify herself by fasting for one more day than the atonement mentioned above. 

**Meaning:** If a menstruating Brahmin woman interacts with a menstruating Kshatriya woman, or a menstruating Kshatriya woman interacts with a menstruating Vaishya woman, or a menstruating Vaishya woman interacts with a menstruating Shudra woman, the Brahmin, Kshatriya, and Vaishya women should purify themselves by fasting for two days. To purify themselves from sitting together, they should fast for three days, and to purify themselves from eating in one line, they should fast for four days.

**27.** The purification of the lower caste woman should be done by fasting for one, two, or three days, and by giving charity. If both menstruating women belong to the same gotra, their purification should be done by fasting for one, two, or three days as mentioned earlier.

**Meaning:** If a menstruating woman of a higher caste touches a menstruating woman of a lower caste, the atonement for the higher caste woman is mentioned in the previous verses. The first part of this verse mentions the atonement for the lower caste woman, and the second part mentions the atonement for women of the same gotra.

**The atonement for touching each other based on the caste hierarchy is as follows:**

**2.** If a menstruating Brahmin woman and a menstruating Kshatriya woman touch each other, the Brahmin woman should fast for two days and the Kshatriya woman should fast for one day.

**3.** If a menstruating Brahmin woman and a menstruating Vaishya woman touch each other, the Brahmin woman should fast for three days and the Vaishya woman should fast for one day.

**1.** If two women of the same caste who are menstruating touch each other, both of them should purify themselves by bathing, fasting, and taking scented water.

**2.** If a menstruating Brahmin woman and a menstruating Kshatriya woman touch each other, the Brahmin woman should fast for two days and the Kshatriya woman should fast for one day.

**3.** If a menstruating Brahmin woman and a menstruating Vaishya woman touch each other, the Brahmin woman should fast for three days and the Vaishya woman should fast for one day.

**Somabhattaraka Composed**

If one sprinkles water on a flower that is a symbol of purity, it becomes pure. Similarly, if a woman experiences her first menstruation, her head should be sprinkled with water by a priest. (31)

She should give appropriate donations to the middle-class people. She should eat and perform other activities in one place only. (32)

**Meaning:** This woman should follow the same rules as a regular menstruating woman. (32)

If a woman is unaware of her menstruation and touches something, that thing and everything within a hand's reach becomes impure. (33)

If someone unknowingly or intentionally eats food given by a woman who is unaware of her menstruation, they should fast for one or two days. (34)

If a bed, mat, or cloth is in the vicinity of a menstruating woman for even less than an hour, they become impure. Similarly, anyone sitting in the same line as the menstruating woman, near the wall she is leaning against, should wash their clothes and bathe. (35)

When the menstruation stops, she should wash all her belongings and bathe. As long as the menstrual flow continues, the impurity remains. (36)

The place where a menstruating woman sleeps, sits, and stands for three days should be cleaned with cow dung and water twice. (37)

**Meaning:** It was mentioned earlier that a menstruating woman should sleep, sit, stand, eat, and drink in one place for three days. The place where she performs these activities for three days should be cleaned with cow dung and water twice. (37)

With him, the one who has drunk from her breast, is purified by bathing.
The one who has touched her, or who has drunk from her breast, is purified by sprinkling with consecrated water. || 38 ||
## RADIA
• 673
.1
A boy who has lived with a menstruating woman for sixteen years is purified by bathing, but one who has drunk from her breast is purified only by sprinkling with consecrated water. || 38 ||
... One who eats from a vessel in which a menstruating woman has eaten, without it having been heated, should fast for two days, bathe, and wash all the clothes on his body. || 39 ||
If one touches the vessel, the cloth, or the place where she has been, then he should bathe and recite the Aparajita mantra one hundred and eight times. || 40 ||
Whatever is not mentioned here should be understood from the customs of the world. Now we will discuss the rules of purification for birth, death, and mixed impurity. || 41 ||
There are two types of impurity: birth impurity and death impurity. There are three types of birth impurity: discharge, miscarriage, and childbirth. || 42 ||
Discharge is said to occur in the third and fourth months of pregnancy. Miscarriage occurs in the fifth and sixth months. Childbirth occurs in the seventh and subsequent months. || 43 ||
**Impurity due to discharge:**
The impurity for the mother due to discharge lasts for as many days as the number of months of the pregnancy. The father and other relatives of the same lineage are purified by bathing only. || 44 ||
**Impurity due to miscarriage:**
The impurity for the mother due to miscarriage lasts for as many days as the number of months of the pregnancy. The impurity for the father and other relatives of the same lineage lasts for one day. || 45 ||

##  37
##  Somasen Bhattaraka Composed...

For a mother, the period of *sutka* (impurity) lasts for as many days as the months of pregnancy. For other siblings, relatives, and the father, it is one day. After the *garbhpat* (miscarriage) *sutka*, everyone should perform *slan* (purification rituals). || 45 ||

##  ... Childbirth *Sutka* ...

For a *nirdosh* (healthy) birth, the *sutka* is ten days. For a *kshatriya* (warrior), it is twelve days, and for a *shudra* (laborer), it is fifteen days. It is important to understand that there is no *sutka* for a king. || 46 ||

For a *brahmana* (priest), the *sutka* is three days, for a *vaishya* (merchant) it is four days, for a *kshatriya* it is five days, and for a *shudra* it is eight days.  ...  Wherever *sutka* rules are mentioned, they should be understood in accordance with these ten days. || 47 ||

##  Death *Shouch* (Impurity)

##  *Gouch* (Impurity due to Birth)

If a child born alive dies before the umbilical cord is cut, the *sutka* for the mother is the full ten days. For the father, siblings, and other relatives up to the fourth generation, it is three days. || 48 ||

If a stillborn child is born or dies after the umbilical cord is cut, the *sutka* for the mother, father, and relatives is the full ten days. || 49 ||

If a child dies before ten days, the *sutka* for everyone is ten days.  ...  In the previous verse, the *sutka* for a child who dies after the umbilical cord is cut was mentioned as ten days for all relatives. If the child dies after that, the *sutka* would be even longer. To clarify this doubt, the author states that the *sutka* for a child who dies before ten days remains ten days, not longer. || 50 ||

On the tenth day, the *sutka* lasts for two days. After that, on the morning of the eleventh day, it lasts for three days. || 51 || 

Page #414:
---------------------------
## Trivarnaachar

This verse's meaning is not fully understood. However, it seems to suggest that if a child dies within ten days, the period of mourning is two days. If the child dies after ten days and before sunrise on the eleventh day, the mourning period is three days. This is also mentioned in the Lok Brahma Suri Trivarnaachar. There is another verse following this one, which states that if a child dies after ten days, on the eleventh day or later, the mourning period for the parents is ten days. Therefore, this interpretation seems appropriate to us. || 51 ||

If a child dies before the naming ceremony, one should bathe. 
|| 52 ||
If the child dies after the naming ceremony, one should bathe and offer tilodak. If the child dies after the Upanayana ceremony, one should bathe, offer tilodak, and perform pinda daan. || 52 ||

The body of a child who dies before the naming ceremony should be buried. If the child dies after the naming ceremony but before the first feeding, the body should be buried or cremated. 
|| 53 ||

The meaning is: If the child dies before the naming ceremony, bury it. If the child dies after the naming ceremony but before the first feeding, bury or cremate it. || 53 ||

If the child is to be buried, dress it in clothes and lay it down in the grave like a piece of wood. || 54 ||

If a child dies after the emergence of teeth, it should be cremated. Alternatively, if a child dies before the naming ceremony or Upanayana, it should be either buried or cremated. Although there is a choice, it should be performed in such a way that before the third year, when the Chulakarma is performed, and after the naming ceremony, i.e., for a period of less than two years, the body should be buried. After that, until the completion of three years, the body can be either buried or cremated. After three years, the body should not be buried but cremated. || 55 ||

For the parents and siblings of a child who dies before the emergence of teeth, the mourning period is ten days. For close relatives, the mourning period is one night. || 56 ||

For distant relatives, only bathing is prescribed. For those who are not related, the mourning period is one-fourth of the day. For those who are not closely related, the mourning period is one-fourth of the day. || 57 ||

Close relatives should touch the body during the burial, cremation, transportation, and other rituals. Distant relatives should not touch the body. || 58 ||

**Trivarnika Achar:**

The characteristics of observation (anirīkṣaṇa) are the same for both a son and a daughter. The period of restriction (adhikāra) is thirty days. || 66 ||

In the case of a son's birth, the mother has a ten-day period of non-observation (anirīkṣaṇa sūtaka), meaning no one should look at her for ten days. She also has a twenty-day period of restriction (anadhikāra sūtaka), meaning she should not perform any household duties for twenty days from the day of delivery. Similarly, in the case of a daughter's birth, there is a ten-day period of non-observation (anirīkṣaṇa sūtaka) and a thirty-day period of restriction (anadhikāra sūtaka). || 65-66 ||

If the father engages in any kind of contact with the mother, such as staying in the same place, he also has a ten-day period of non-observation (anirīkṣaṇa sūtaka), meaning no one should look at him for ten days. If he stays with the mother but does not touch her, he has a ten-day period of untouchability (aspṛśya sūtaka), meaning no one should touch him for ten days. || 67 ||

A death sūtaka is purified by another death sūtaka, and a birth sūtaka is purified by another birth sūtaka. However, a birth sūtaka is not purified by a death sūtaka. Meaning: If a death sūtaka is followed by another death sūtaka, or a birth sūtaka is followed by another birth sūtaka, the second sūtaka is completed on the same day as the completion of the first sūtaka. If a birth sūtaka is followed by a death sūtaka, the birth sūtaka is also completed on the day the death sūtaka is completed. However, if a death sūtaka is followed by a birth sūtaka, the death sūtaka is not completed on the day the birth sūtaka is completed. || 68 ||

The characteristics of a Deshāntara (different region): A Deshāntara is defined as a place where the language changes, a large river acts as a barrier, or a mountain range separates the regions. || 69 ||

A distance of thirty yojanas or more between two regions is also considered a Deshāntara. This sūtaka applies to sapinda (relatives up to the fourth generation) residing in a Deshāntara, based on the difference in regions. Meaning: If sapinda relatives up to the fourth generation reside in a Deshāntara, they are subject to this sūtaka due to the difference in regions, not their children. || 69-70 ||

If the parents die, even if the son is far away, he observes a ten-day period of mourning (daśarātraka) starting from the day he hears the news. || 71 ||

##  Translation:

**Chapter 71**

If a father and mother have passed away and their son is living in a foreign land, then he should observe a period of mourning for ten days from the day he receives the news of their death.

**Chapter 72**

Similarly, the mourning period for a wife is also ten days. The sage said, "The mourning period for a wife is ten days, and the mourning period for a husband is also ten days."

**Chapter 73**

If a wife is living far away and receives the news of her husband's death after ten days, or if a husband is living far away and receives the news of his wife's death after ten days, then both of them should observe a period of mourning for ten days from the day they receive the news of the death.

**Chapter 74**

Just as a son observes a period of mourning for ten days after hearing the news of his parents' death, even after many years, the husband and wife should also observe a period of mourning for ten days for each other.

**Chapter 75**

If the mother dies within the ten-day mourning period for the father, then the father's body should be cremated with mantras, but the water rituals should not be performed.

**Chapter 76**

After the ten-day mourning period for the father, the mother's mourning period (one and a half days) begins. After performing the water rituals and other rites, the mother's remaining rituals should be performed.

**Chapter 77**

If the father dies within the ten-day mourning period for the mother, then the mourning period for the father will be ten days from the day of his death.

**Meaning:**

According to the verse "Mritakam Mritakenaiv," just as the mother's mourning period ends with the father's ten-day mourning period if the mother dies within the ten-day mourning period for the father, similarly, the father's mourning period should also end with the mother's ten-day mourning period if the father dies within the ten-day mourning period for the mother. However, this rule does not apply here. The verse "Maturdashāhamध्ये" etc. contradicts the verse "Mritakam Mritakenaiv" etc. The reason for this is that "Samatve Gurunalagho Badhyate Laghunā Gurun Badhyate," meaning that in the case of equal mourning periods, the shorter mourning period is overridden by the longer mourning period, but the longer mourning period is not overridden by the shorter one. 

Page #418:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Varnikaachar** (Varnikaachar) is the practice of observing mourning rituals. Therefore, the father's previous mourning period (Ashouch) obstructs the mother's subsequent mourning period (Ashouch), but the mother's previous mourning period does not obstruct the father's subsequent mourning period. This is why the mother's mourning period ends on the day the father's mourning period ends, but the father's mourning period does not end on the day the mother's mourning period ends. || 77.5

One should perform the first Shraddha for the father on the tenth day after his death. After that, one should perform the first Shraddha for the mother and then perform sixteen Shraddhas for her. After that, one should perform all the Shraddhas for the father. || 78 ||

If the son hears of the death of both his mother and father on the same day, even if he is far away, he should observe the mourning period for both equally. || 79 ||

If a member of one's family goes to a distant land and no news of them is received, then if they are in the early stage of life (Tarunavastha), one should wait for twenty-eight years, if they are in the middle stage of life, one should wait for fifteen years, and if they are in the later stage of life (after the middle stage), one should wait for twelve years. After that, one should perform the funeral rites according to the prescribed procedures. One should perform the Shraddha and observe atonement for six years according to one's capacity. If the deceased returns after the funeral rites have been performed, one should bathe them with ghee and medicinal substances, perform all the birth rites, and perform a new Yajnopaveet ceremony. If they were previously married and their former wife is still alive, then one should remarry them to her. || 80-84 ||

**Shuddhik Din Rogiko Snaanvidhi** (The bathing ritual for a sick person on the day of purification): If a sick person arises, the healthy person should bathe ten times and then touch the sick person, thereby attaining purification. || 85 ||

##  Sīm-Sen-Bhaṭṭāraka-Vicit:

**85.** If a person in the house is sick or afflicted with any disease, and therefore cannot perform the Lāna on the day of purification, then another healthy person should bathe and touch him, then bathe and touch him again, and then bathe ten times and touch him. By doing this, the sick person will be purified.

**86-88.** If a woman suffering from fever becomes menstruating, how can she be purified? What action can make her pure? This is a difficult problem. Therefore, the solution is that on the fourth day, another woman should bathe and touch the menstruating woman, then bathe and touch her again, then bathe and touch her again. In this way, she should bathe and touch her ten to twelve times, and perform Ācamana after each bath. Finally, the woman who touched her should remove her own clothes and the menstruating woman's clothes, and bathe. By doing this, the menstruating woman suffering from fever will be purified.

**89.** If a menstruating woman dies, she should be bathed with five Gavya, dressed in different clothes, and cremated according to the prescribed rituals.

**90-91.** If a woman who has given birth dies, what should the Yājñika do? The ritual is to fill a pot with water and five Gavya, and sprinkle it with the Punyāhvācana mantras. By doing this, the woman who has given birth will be purified. Then, her body should be cremated according to the prescribed rituals.

**92.** If a person dies within ten days, how can they be purified? How should the cremation be performed? 

Page #420:

## Trivarnakaachar:

**93.**  She should be bathed ten times with water, then with pure water, water with five leaves, panchagavya, and kushodak. 

**94.**  After that, she should be bathed and anointed with kushodak.  Then, following the prescribed procedure, the funeral pyre should be lit with mantras.

**92-94.**  **Question:** If a pregnant woman dies within ten days of childbirth, how is she purified and how is her funeral performed? 

**Answer:** The householder should bathe the deceased woman ten times in a pot filled with water.  She should be bathed successively with pure water, water with five leaves, panchagavya, and kushodak.  Then, she should be anointed with kushodak.  After that, her funeral should be performed according to the prescribed procedure.

**95.**  I will now explain the purification process for householders.  If a pregnant woman dies, how do people perform her funeral?

**96.**  If a pregnant woman dies before six months of pregnancy, she should be cremated along with the fetus.  The fetus should not be removed.

**97.**  If the fetus is more than six months old, the deceased woman should be taken to the cremation ground.  Her husband, son, father, or elder brother should cut open her abdomen on the left side below the navel and remove the fetus.

**98.**  Then, the fetus should be sprinkled with the Punyahvachan mantra.

**99.**  If the fetus is alive, it should be given for rearing.  The abdominal cavity should be filled with curd and ghee and sealed.

**100.**  The deceased woman should be bathed with water mixed with clay, ash, kusha grass, and sandalwood, and with panchagavya, all chanted with mantras.  She should be dressed in new clothes and cremated.

**95-100.**  **Explanation:**  The purification process for householders will be explained step by step.  If a pregnant woman dies, how is her funeral performed?  First, we will answer this question.  If a pregnant woman dies before six months of pregnancy, she should be cremated along with the fetus.  The fetus should not be removed.  If the fetus is more than six months old, the deceased woman should be taken to the cremation ground.  Her husband, son, father, or elder brother should cut open her abdomen on the left side below the navel and remove the fetus.  Then, the fetus should be sprinkled with the Punyahvachan mantra.  If the fetus is alive, it should be given for rearing.  The abdominal cavity should be filled with curd and ghee and sealed.  The deceased woman should be bathed with water mixed with clay, ash, kusha grass, and sandalwood, and with panchagavya, all chanted with mantras.  She should be dressed in new clothes and cremated.

**101.**  If a woman's husband dies, she should observe a period of ten days of mourning.  She should also observe her menstrual cycle.  After becoming pure, she should bathe and discard her ornaments.

##  Translation:

**Somasen Bhattaraka's Composition**

If a woman gives birth or menstruates on the tenth day after her husband's death, she should become pure by observing her prescribed period of purity, bathe, and discard her clothes and ornaments. This concludes the discussion regarding women. Now, we will discuss the concept of *Durmarana* (unnatural death) and other related matters. || 101 ||

*Durmarana* is an unnatural death.

Death caused by lightning, water, fire, Chandala (outcast), snake, hunter, bird, tree, tiger, and other animals is considered *Durmarana* for sinners. || 102 ||

If someone commits suicide by poison, weapon, or fire, they willingly embrace death and will surely go to hell. || 103 ||

Due to fear of the place and time, the cremation rites cannot be performed immediately. Therefore, one should perform the cremation rites after obtaining the order of the king or other authorities. || 104 ||

One year later, one should perform the *Shanti* (peace) ritual and observe a fast, etc., as prescribed. || 105 ||

If someone dies unwillingly due to poison, etc., the cremation rites should be performed immediately. One should not perform the *Prayaschitta* (atonement) for such an unnatural death. || 106 ||

If someone dies within seven days of being struck by a weapon, etc., it is considered *Durmarana*, as stated by the ancient sages. || 107 ||

**Regarding Daughters:**

If a daughter dies before her *Choula* (ceremony), the relatives should only bathe. They become pure by bathing. If she dies before her *Vrata* (vow), one day of mourning is observed. If she dies before her marriage, three days of mourning are observed. || 108 ||

If a married woman dies, her parents observe a fortnight of mourning. The relatives observe a fortnight of mourning, and the husband observes a full month of mourning. || 109 ||

Two days and one night are called pākṣika. One day and one night are called naiśikī. From sunrise to sunset is called a day and the present moment is called sadhastāt kāla. ... In this way, the wise (manīṣi) have decided on the time in this āśauca chapter. || 110-111 ||
Mastāsvathvā tāsu mṛtāsu pitṛsadani.

If a birth or death occurs at the father's house, then his parents should observe a three-night āśauca and his relatives should observe a one-day āśauca. || 112 ||
Āśauca for a daughter. If her parents die at her house or elsewhere.
Daśāhābhyantaram punyāstrirātraṁ śāvasūtakam. || 113 ||
If her parents die at her house or elsewhere, then whenever it is known within ten days, there is a three-night śūtaka for her. || 113 ||
Svamurghre mṛto bhrātā bhrātūr vātha gṛhe svāsā.
Āśaucaṁ tridinaṁ tatra pākṣinyau vā paratra tu. || 114 ||
If a brother dies at his sister's house or a sister dies at her brother's house, then both should observe a three-day śūtaka. And if they die elsewhere, then both should observe a pākṣika (one day, one night, and one day and a half) śūtaka. || 114 ||
Bhagīnīsūtakam caiva bhrātustaiva ātha sūtakam.
Naiva syādbhāvapalyāśca tathā ca bhagīnīpateḥ. || 115 ||
There is no śūtaka for a sister's śūtaka, a brother's wife, or a brother's śūtaka, a sister's husband. Meaning - There is no śūtaka for a sister-in-law for her brother-in-law, and no śūtaka for a brother-in-law for his sister-in-law. But - || 115 ||

Somsenmarakavarchit. When a brother's wife (bhabhi) hears of the death of her sister-in-law (nanand) and a sister's husband (bahnoi) hears of the death of his brother-in-law (sale), they should bathe immediately, and the members of the family should also bathe. || 116 ||
Maternal grandfather (matamaho), maternal uncle (matul) and their wives, grandson (dauhitra), nephew (bhagineya) and the sisters of the father, if they die at home, there is a three-day ashoucha, and if they die elsewhere, there is a pakshini ashoucha. And if their death is heard after ten days, purification is achieved by bathing alone. Meaning - For the death of a maternal grandfather and grandmother, maternal uncle and aunt, grandson and nephew, and maternal aunt and paternal aunt, there is a three-day ashoucha if they die at home and a pakshini ashoucha if they die elsewhere. And if their death is heard after ten days, purification is achieved by bathing alone. || 117-118 ||
For the sick (vyadhit), miser (kadarya), debtor (rinagrast), one who does not perform rituals (kriyaheen), fool (mookha), one who is controlled by a woman (streejit), especially, || 119 ||
One whose mind is attached to vices (vyasanasaktchitta), one who is always dependent on others (paradheen), one who does not perform shraddha (shraddhatyagi), one who does not give charity (pandapandapi), || 120 ||
One who has fallen from his caste (patit) and a wicked person (dusht), the sutak is bhasmant - until the body is burnt. If the body is burnt by themselves, then the sutak is for three days. Meaning - The words vyadhit, kadarya, rinagrast, etc. are common; therefore, their use is seen in ordinary situations as well as in specific situations. Those who do not have faith in the words of the Agam, who do not want to believe in things like sutak, they start applying these words to even the most trivial situations. Therefore, it is the duty of the wise to use these words in specific places. || 119-121 ||
For those who have taken vows (vatin), those who have been initiated (dikshit), those who are Yagnik (yajnik) and Brahmachari (brahmachari), there is no ashoucha except for the death of their father. || 122 ||
Shrotriya (shrotriya), Acharya (acharya), disciple (shishya), Rpi (rpi), scripture reader (shastradhyaya), Guru (guru), friend (mitra), one who is righteous (dharmi) and one who studies together (sahadhyayi), one should bathe upon their death. || 123 ||

**Trivarnikaachar.** In the case of the commencement of great religious ceremonies like Yagna, Mahaanayaas, etc., and the destruction of abundant wealth, if a family member dies, then immediate purification is prescribed. **Meaning:** Such a situation is considered pure after taking a bath. **124**

If a wise and righteous person, a Brahmachari or a Grihastha, dies by the method of Sannyasa, then the cremation of his body is prescribed as follows: The dead body should be brought out of the house, washed with water, and adorned with new clothes, fragrance, flowers, etc., as appropriate. Then, where the cremation is to be performed, a worldly fire (Chulha's fire) should be made for cremation, according to the prescribed method. **125-127**

For the cremation of a wise and distinguished person, this **Aupaasana Agni** should be used, and for others, the worldly fire. **128**

For a virgin and a widow, **Santaapani** is prescribed for cremation, and for other women, **Anv Agni**. **129**

**The acceptance and characteristics of Laukik Agni:** For all except the twice-born, the worldly fire is prescribed. The fire used for cooking, etc., in the house, is called Laukik Agni. **130**

Mantra: Om Om Om Om Ram Ram Ram Agnisandhukshanam Karoomi Swaha. Recite this mantra while igniting the fire. Offer ghee and other things, ignite the fire, and then go to a water body and bathe.

Then, all the relatives should go to the water body. However, the one who will lift the body and the one who will perform the rites should circumambulate the pyre and then go. || 149 ||

If death occurs on an inauspicious day, or if the deceased is resurrected after a long time, then, to remove the inauspiciousness, the one who performs the rites should circumambulate the pyre, fold his hands, and offer a prayer to the Lord. || 150-151 ||

One should worship the great machine (the body) to the best of one's ability. One should perform a peace-giving fire ceremony and recite the great mantra. || 152 ||

Then, making a young boy go ahead, all should proceed towards the village. || 171 || 

**After this, considering that the body of the deceased has been destroyed, as it is the abode of the three jewels, the means of renunciation and meditation, and the cause of attaining the highest afterlife, with love for dharma and love for the deceased, a stone should be installed in a pavilion on the bank of a water body, or without a pavilion, for the pinda-daan. The performer should offer pinda and tilodak from the front of the stone, and all other relatives should bathe and offer tilodak. After that, all should bathe with immersion.

Before and after offering the pind, the giver should bathe. The pind should be made of rice, equal in size to a keyaki fruit. The rice should be cooked outside, not inside the house. The rice, the cooking pot, the stone, and the clothes worn by the giver should all be kept outside in a secret place before the offering. They should not be brought from the house.

**On the eleventh day, one should perform the cremation, dress the deceased, carry the body on the shoulders of four men, and feed six men with food.** (191)

**Duties on the twelfth day:** On the twelfth day, one should perform the worship of the Jina, followed by the *shraddha* ceremony for the monks and relatives. (192) Offering food with devotion to the virtuous is called *shraddha*. This *shraddha* should be performed every month on the anniversary of the death, for a year. (193) After that, one should perform the *shraddha* annually for twelve years. (194)

**Establishment of the Image:** For a renowned person who has passed away after renouncing the world and attaining meditation and yoga, one should establish an image (such as footprints) in a sacred place, like a pavilion. (195)

**Widowhood Initiation:** After the death of her husband, on the twelfth day, the widow should bathe in a water body and offer gifts to five other women. (196) These gifts should include food, fruits, perfumes, clothes, flowers, money, betel nut, and garlands. (197) It is best if the widow then takes initiation as a Jain nun (Aryika or Ksullaka). If not, she should take the initiation of widowhood. (198)

**Duties during Widowhood:** During the initiation of widowhood, one should observe the vows of the country, renounce the neck thread, and refrain from wearing earrings. (199)

## Trivarna-achar. 
The remaining kings should refrain from wearing clothes with more than one piece of cloth, covering their head with a shawl, sleeping on a bed, applying kajal to their eyes, using turmeric paste for bathing, crying in sorrow, engaging in idle talk. They should bathe daily in the morning, perform achaman, pranayama, and tarpan, offer arghya, recite stotras thrice a day, perform japa, listen to scriptures, contemplate them, cultivate the twelve bhavanas, and practice atma-bhavana. They should donate food as per their capacity, eat only once without greed, and refrain from chewing betel nut. On the day of shraddha, they should perform tarpan and japa according to the aforementioned method, along with mantras. 

## Conclusion. 
Thus, the four types of sutak - pat, srav, prasuti, and maran - have been explained for the purification of householders seeking liberation. Along with this, the performance of a pure shraddha, which involves offering food with devotion, has also been explained. Those noble individuals who observe these four types of sutak and perform shraddha are highly virtuous and deserve praise from Shri Somasen.

**214** This excellent scripture has been composed by me, Soma Sena, who desires liberation, for the sake of Dharma, Artha, and Kama (the three aims of life). Therefore, those who are always devoted to the Dharma of householders should study it.

**215** I do not know the meters, nor am I skilled in poetry, nor do I know grammar, economics, or drama. Still, I have composed this scripture. Therefore, the wise should not laugh at me.

**216** If there are any grammatical errors in this scripture, let the Bhavyas, who are endowed with excellent intellect, correct them with a Dharma-oriented perspective. For the Creator (Karma) has created benefactors on this earth for the purpose of benefiting others.
