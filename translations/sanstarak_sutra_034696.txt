## Āgama Sūtra 29, Payannā Sūtra-6, 'Sanstāraka'
[29] Sanstāraka Payannā Sūtra-6 - Hindi Translation
Sūtra-1
Saluting the Supreme Lord Mahāvīra, the Śramaṇa Bhagavān, the Kevala Jnānī, who is like a bull among the common Kevala Jnānīs, and the Lord of Gods, Śrī Jineśvara Deva; I speak of the tradition obtained by accepting the Santhāra, which is the worship of the final time. Sūtra-2
This worship, as spoken by Śrī Jina, is in the form of the worship of the Dharma of conduct. Well-behaved men desire this final worship, because it is the acceptance of the flag of all their worship throughout their lives. Sūtra-3
Just as poor men find joy in wealth, grain, etc., and then strong men take pride in winning the victory flag, and from its lack they experience disgrace and sorrow, so well-behaved men find joy and pride in this worship. Sūtra-4,5
Just as vaidūrya is for all kinds of gems, sandalwood is for all kinds of fragrant substances, and vajra is for all kinds of jewels, and just as the Arihant Paramātma is for all the best men, and the mother of the Tīrthankaras is for all the women of the world, so this worship of Santhāra is superior for the well-behaved soul. Sūtra-6
And just as the lineage of Śrī Jineśvara Deva is for the lineage, the Śrāvakakula is for all the families, the Siddhi Gati is for the movement, the liberation is for all kinds of happiness, and Sūtra-7
just as the Śrī Jina-spoken Ahiṃsā Dharma is for all the Dharma, the words of the virtuous man are for the words of the people, and the purity of the Ātmaguṇa in the form of Samyaktva is for all kinds of purity, so this worship is essential in the Śrī Jina-spoken worship of the final time. Sūtra-8
This worship in the form of Samadhi-Mṛtyu is truly auspicious. It is the ultimate cause of progress and advancement. Therefore, such worship is rare even for the gods in the three worlds. Even the Indra of the heavenly world desires the death of a learned man with Samadhi with one mind. Sūtra-9
O obedient one! You have obtained the Śrī Jina-spoken death of a learned man. Therefore, without any doubt, you have obtained the victory flag in the form of the attainment of that Siddhi by defeating the Karma-Malla. Sūtra-10
Just as the Paramśukladhyāna is for all kinds of meditation, Kevala Jnāna is for knowledge like Matyādi Jnāna, and the Yathākhyāta Chāritra obtained from the suppression of Kṣaya, etc., is the cause of liberation in all kinds of Chāritra.

**Āgama Sūtra 29, Payannāsūtra-6, Sanstāraka Sūtra - 11, 12**

Shree Jin-kathith Shramanatva, is considered the best benefit among all kinds of best benefits; because through its practice, Shree Tirthankaratva, Kevalgyan and Moksha, happiness is attained. And then, for the benefit of the afterlife, the root of attaining Moksha for the blood-stained and afflicted Mithyatvi soul, which is considered to be Samyaktva, is considered to be of special importance. From this, the importance of the benefit of attaining Shree Jin-kathith Shramanatva is even greater. Because, the success of the cause of liberation, which is equal to knowledge and vision, has been based on Shramanatva. Sūtra-13

And, in all kinds of Leshya, just as Shukulaleshya is considered a special quality for all vows, Yamas, etc., like the vow of Brahmacharya and for all kinds of rules, like Shree Jin-kathith five Samitis and three Guptis, similarly Shramanya is the main quality in all qualities. While the worship of Santhara is considered even greater than this. Sūtra - 14

In all the best Tirths, just as the Tirth of Shree Tirthankar Dev, the Abhishek performed by Devdevendra, like the peak of Sumeru, for the Abhishek of all castes, the worship of Santhara of a well-equipped man is considered superior. Sūtra - 15

White lotus, full Kalash, Swastika Nandavart and beautiful flower garland, all these auspicious things are also more auspicious than the worship of Santhara, which is the form of the last time. Sūtra - 16

Those great souls who destroy the karma-wood with the fire of Jin-kathith tapas, who are brave in the observance of the rules of Viraati, who are pure in self-realization through Samyaggyan, and who have attained the path of the best Dharma, ride on the elephant of Santhara and happily cross over. Sūtra - 17

This Santhara is an unparalleled support for the well-equipped soul. It is the abode of qualities, it is the form of Kalpa-Achar, and it is the root cause of the supreme Shree Tirthankar Pad, Moksha-Gati and Siddha-Dasha. Sūtra - 18

You have obtained a body adorned with nectar like Shree Jin-Vachan. The Vasudhara, which resides in your abode, is resting on the jewel of Dharma. Sūtra - 19

Because you have obtained everything worth having in the world. And by adopting the worship of Santhara, you have shown good patience for Jin-Pravachan. Therefore, you have obtained the tradition of such auspicious benefits, which are served by the best men and are supremely divine. Sūtra - 20

And, you have obtained the beautiful jewel of Samyaggyan and Darshan, adorned with the special kind of light of knowledge, and the pure Triratna Mala, with qualities like character, conduct, etc. Sūtra - 21

The well-equipped man, through whose practice, the tradition of qualities can be obtained, those souls who obtain Shree Jin-kathith Santhara, which is virtuous, have increased their brilliance in the world with the adornment of the essential jewel of knowledge, etc.

Just as Mount Meru is in the mountains, just as the self-born ocean is in all the oceans, just as the moon is for the group of stars, so the Santhara-like ritual is considered to be the main one in the midst of all kinds of auspicious rituals. Sutra - 31
O Bhagavan! For what kind of Sadhupurusha is the worship of this Santhara prescribed? And then, by obtaining what support can this worship of the final time be done? And when can one take the vow of fasting? I want to know this. Sutra - 32
Those Sadhus who have good yoga in their mind, speech, and body, and who have developed various kinds of diseases in their body, and who, considering their death to be near, adopt the Santhara, are pure Santhara.

Who can estimate the priceless benefit that a great soul, who has ascended Santhara according to the Dharma, receives on the very first day?  ..........

You have experienced countless times the great pain of being born in the state of a Tiryanch, from which you could not escape. In this way, you have wandered in the world for an infinite time, where birth and death are like the revolving wheels of a rent. Sutra-97
You have experienced countless births and deaths for an infinite time in the world. All this suffering is natural for all living beings in the world. Therefore, do not be afraid of the suffering of the present moment and do not forget the worship.
Sutra-98
There is no greater fear than death, and there is no other suffering like birth. Therefore, quickly break the attachment to the body, which is the cause of the great fear of birth and death. Sutra-99
This body is different from the soul. And the soul is different from the body. You should definitely break the attachment to the body, which is the root of suffering and affliction, like the material cause. Because in this vast and boundless world, the soul experiences countless times the suffering related to the body and the mind. Sutra-100
Therefore, if you want to attain the state of Samadhi-death, you should completely abandon the attachment to the body and other internal and external possessions for the sake of attaining that supreme meaning. Sutra-101
I forgive all my offenses to the entire congregation, who are like a refuge for the world, and who are benevolent, with a pure heart and free from malice, and I also forgive the congregation, who are like a foundation of virtue. Sutra-102
And I forgive, with three-fold yoga, all those whom I have caused to generate passions, including the Acharya, the Upadhyaya, the disciple, the fellow-religionist, the family and the group, etc., because I was the cause of their passions. Sutra-103
I forgive all the offenses of the entire Shraman congregation with folded hands, as if in offering. And I also forgive everyone. Sutra-104
And then, with a mind devoted to the Dharma spoken by the Jinas, I forgive, with a pure heart and with a feeling of brotherhood, all the living beings in the world. And I also forgive everyone.

## Āgama Sūtra 29, Payannāsūtra-6, Sanstāraka Sūtra-105

The क्षपक soul, who forgives such transgressions and attains the unparalleled penance and the unparalleled samadhi, dwells in equanimity, consuming the group of karmas, the root cause of various obstacles, afflictions, etc. Sūtra - 106

The क्षपक soul, who is mounted on Santhara, destroys all the groups of karmas, which are bound by the tradition of countless lakhs of kotis of inauspicious births, in one moment, through the power of auspicious determination. Sūtra - 107

On this occasion, if the great क्षपak, mounted on Santhara, experiences pain arising from the inauspicious yogas of the past, which obstructs the state of samadhi, then to pacify it, give him soothing Dharma teachings like cool sandalwood, in the form of songs. Sūtra - 108

O virtuous one! The ancient Munis, who have surrendered everything in devotion, were engaged in Kayotsarga meditation on the peak of a terrifying mountain, surrounded by wild animals, even without such practices. Sūtra - 109

And then, those great sages, who possess extreme fortitude and dwell in the path of the Jinakathita devotion in an unparalleled manner, maintain their state of samadhi and practice the highest Dharma, even when they are in the jaws of wild animals. Sūtra - 110

O well-being! The निर्यामक sadhu, who possesses fortitude and a healthy mental state, always helps others. In such circumstances, can they not attain the state of samadhi and cross the Santhara devotion? Meaning, you should easily cross the Santhara. Sūtra - 111

Because the soul is different from the body, and the body is also different from the soul. Therefore, the well-being person, who has abandoned attachment to the body, also abandons the body for the sake of the Jinakathita Dharma devotion. Sūtra - 112

"The क्षपak, mounted on Santhara, endures the pains arising from the inauspicious karmas of the past with equanimity, and shakes the tradition of karma-stains like a vine from its roots. Therefore, you too should endure this pain with equanimity and destroy karma." Sūtra - 113

The soul, who consumes the group of karmas through penance, actions, etc., for many crores of years, protects the soul through the yogas of mind, speech, and body. The wise soul consumes that group of karmas only in a breath. Because the effect of the practice with right knowledge is inconceivable. Sūtra - 114

The wise soul, who protects the soul through mind, speech, and body, consumes the eight types of karmas accumulated from many births, which are equal to sin, only in a breath. Therefore, O well-being! You should also be diligent in this devotion, with the support of right knowledge.

**Āgama Sūtra 29, Payannāsūtra-6, ‘Sāṃstāraka’ Sūtra - 115**

Those fortunate souls who obtain this kind of beneficial instruction, having been praised by their guru and other elders, will, with fortitude, mount the saṃthāra, consume all kinds of karmic defilement, and surely attain siddhi in this or the third existence, and obtain the state of great bliss. Sūtra - 116

Charming due to qualities like secrecy and the committee, invaluable due to the three jewels of right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct, and possessing qualities like restraint, austerity, and rules; Sūtra - 117

The great crown of the glorious assembly, adorned with gold, is worthy of worship, extremely rare, and pure in the three realms of gods, demigods, asuras, and humans. It is the foundation of pure qualities, therefore supremely pure, and is revered by all. Sūtra - 118

Even though burning in the heat of the sun, which is fierce and powerful with a thousand rays, like a red-hot iron cauldron in the summer season, mounted on a black rock; Sūtra - 119

The fortunate man, who has conquered passions and other afflictions, who is always engaged in meditation, who is endowed with the supreme purity of knowledge and faith, and whose mind is dedicated to worship; Sūtra - 120

He has attained samadhi-death, which is like the result of the highest leshyā, as rare as the measurement of the sun's rays, like perfect knowledge, and full of equanimity, like the highest meaning. Sūtra - 121

Thus, I have praised those who have mounted the back of the elephant of saṃthāra, the final stage of life, as described by the Jinas, and who are like the moon for kings, the Śramaṇa men, who are eternal, independent, and possess an unbroken tradition of everlasting happiness.
