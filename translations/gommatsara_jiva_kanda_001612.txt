PUBLISHER'S NOTE. It is with a heavy heart, and a palsied pen that I have laboured to write these few lines.
"The Sacred Books of the Jainas" reminds me of the passing away of my very dear friend Kumar Devendra Prasada Jaina, who founded the above "Series " and published in 1917, its first volume," Dravya Samgraha", a monumental work on Jaina Philosophy by Acharya Shri Nemichandra Siddhant Chakravarti, translated and edited by Mr. Sarat Chandra Ghoshal, M. A., B. L., Saraswati, Kavya-Tirtha, Vidya Bhushan, Bharati, with a learned Introduction covering 48 pages, and exhaustive commentaries. The original text consists of 58 verses only, but their translation, and commentaries cover 123 pages of Royal Size. Dear departed Devendra was a born publisher. The publication of the highest authoritative works of Jaina Acharyas for the glory of Jainism and for the benefit of Humanity was the one aim and ambition of his life, for which he sacrificed his worldly prosperity, his College career, and even his life.
With his boundless enthusiasm, single-minded devotion, and selfless exertions, he succeeded in securing the co-operation of scholars of exceptionally high attainments, like Professor A. Chakravarti of the Presidency College, Madras, and Mr. J. L. Jaini, M. A., (Oxon.) Bar-at-law, Judge, High Court, Indore.
Mr. J. L. Jaini, M. A., M.R.A.S., then Chief Justice of Indore. translated and edited the Tattwarthadhigama Sutra, which he has very appropriately called the Jaina Bible, and followed up by under-taking the translation with commentaries of Gommatsara, the Encyclopaedia of Jain Philosophy. This work was begun by him in the Chaturmasa, the rainy season, of 1927, when Jaina Dharma Bhushana Brahmachari Sital Prasadaji stayed with him, and helped him. The printing was commenced in the rainy weather of 1926, when Brahmachariji decided to stay at Ajitashram and supervise the work.

The whole text of this work, and of Part 1 of Karma Kanda had been printed off in March 1927. The stock of feather-weight paper which was being used for the work was completely exhausted before the Index, etc. and title pages could be printed. The mills also had no more such paper left in stock. An order was placed with them to manufacture such paper afresh, and thus an unexpected delay has been occasioned in the publication of Gommatasara.
This sudden breakdown was an extremely unfortunate circumstance. The intense poignancy of this mishap was felt on the sudden receipt of a wire from Indore announcing the death of Mr. J. L. Jaini. Alas, this great master of Jaina Philosophy could not live to see the greatest monumental work of his life in the shape of a bound volume. It saddens my heart so much, when the discussions he had with me in May last, as to the manner and quality of the binding come to my mind.
This is my first venture as a publisher; and the responsibility has been forced upon me by the miserable decree of Fate which has taken away from us the Founder-Publisher of the Sacred Books of the Jainas, and the incomparable author of two of the most authentic, ancient, and standard works of Jaina Philosophy.
The defects, for which I am responsible, are too many to escape notice. I have no justification to plead in self-defence. I confess my short-comings, and throw myself on the indulgence of the benevolent readers of this volume.
The depth and vastness of the knowledge displayed here-in, and the thorough and exhaustive analysis of the endless varieties of mental vibrations is amazing and fascinating indeed.
Gommatsara will, I hope, be found to be a real treat by the scholar, the seeker after truth, the Jnani and the Dhyani, and will, for the Right Believer, prove a practical guide to the path of Liberation.

PREFACE.
My "Outlines of Jainism" was published by the Cambridge Uni. versity Press for the Jaina Literature Society, London, in 1916, in advance of a series designed to consist principally, but not exclusively, of translations from authoritative texts. The aim was to put the whole Jaina Canon in brief on one bookshelf. In pursuance of this idea, which I brought back with me from Oxford and London in 1910 and 1913, the Jaina sacred texts began to be translated. My friend, the late Kumar Devendra Prasada was in constant consultation with me. With his most enthusiastic and inimitable love for the work, he published some Jaina works and then started the Sacred Books of the Jaina Series, with the splendid First Volume of Dravya Sangraha, edited by Mr. S. C. Ghosal in 1916. My Tattvartha Sutra followed as the Second Volume in 1920, The learned Prof. A. Chakravarti gave us the Third Volume as Panchasti Kaya at the end of the same year. Purushartha Siddhyupaya, with translation and Commentaries was prepared by my learned brother Pandit Ajit Prasada, of Ajitashram Lucknow; and the Indian Press of Allahabad had printed about half the book when the Kumar suddenly died.
On the 14th December 1920 Kumar Devendra Prasada wrote to me, saying "Volume V be your Gommatasara." I take this as a testamentary wish of a beloved soul and therefore publish this translation as Volume Fifth of the Sacred Books of the Jainas. Volume Fourth, Purushartha Siddyupaya is also in Press.

This translation of Gommatasara Jivakanda was made in the rainy season of 1917 at Indore. In 1918, I fell most seriously-ill with influenza and double pneumonia, and only in 1919 it became for the manuscript to begin to be published at the instance of the late lamented Kumar Devendra Prasada of Arrah, in the Jaina Gazette. Madras. After 79 gathas had been published, it was decided not to publish it in this periodical fashion, but to print it as a book at once. On 17th April 1921, to the great loss of the cause of publication of Jaina Literature, the young, energetic and talented Kumar died. The work of publication was postponed.
In 1922, I wanted to undertake to publish it myself but I found that the late Kumar had mislaid or lost Gathas 79 to 250. My health and many official duties forbade a re-translation of the Gathas myself; therefore under my supervision, I had the work done by kind and obliging friends. Jaina Dharma Bhushana Brahmachari Sital Prasada did it in 1923 with the help of the brilliant Scholar and Sanskrit Professor Hira Lall Jain, M.A., LL. B.. of the Government College, Amraoti. The gap in the Ms. being thus filled, it was once more complete. The Devendra Printing Press at Madras was being started by Mr. C. S. Mallinath, the enthusiastic Editor of the Jaina Gazette, and he wanted to publish the Ms. My learned brother Professor A. Chakravarti, M. A., I. E. S. of the Presidency College, Madras, kindly undertook to help Brahmachariji if he went to Madras to supervise the publication. This was in 1924. I was ill again from June 1924 to February 1925. On my recovery I took up the question once more. But owing to Antaraya (obstructive) Karma, a serious attack of diabetic Coma prostrated me on almost a death-bed from December 1925. On my return home from Hospital in May 1926 I made up my mind to publish this and my other unpublished Manuscripts, anyhow.
Brahmachariji readily, promptly and almost eagerly came up with his generous help of time and trouble. My learned and revered brother Pandit Ajit Prasada, M. A., LL. B., late Government Pleader of Lucknow, agreed to collaborate. The famous Newal Kishore Press, Lucknow undertook the publication. Thus being equipped with men and munition for this warfare against deadly ignorance and superstition, I bade Brahmachariji Godspeed to Lucknow in July 1926.
When the book was in Press, Brahmachariji got the last Gathas 79 to 250 also from Arrah in August 1926, after such trouble in replacing them in 1922 !

I have given this longish history of the delay in publication to bring out a few points :
(1). All important Manuscripts must be kept most carefully. The risk of loss by moths or in transit etc., must be avoided.
(2). If possible, more than one copy of the Manuscript should be typed, to guard against any irreplaceable loss of it.
(3). The Manuscript as soon as it is ready may be given even to some Jaina periodical to be published. It is easier to reprint it in book form later, when many mistakes can be avoided and corrections made.
(4). True lovers of Jainism, learned men and rich men, should co-operate and organise the public service of the community in such a manner that the invaluable work of the preservation and propagation of Jaina Sacred Books in all important languages may be accelerated.
As to the great authority and veneration of Shri Gommatasara, it is enough to say that if Tattvartha Sutra is the Jaina Bible, the Gommatasara is a brief expansion of a part of that Bible, giving the Path to Perfection or Liberation.
The Path is clear and conclusive. If followed, it leads to the Goal, Liberation,
The Goal cannot be attained without following it.
The Soul-Classes, Quests and Stages, given in this book, may be verified by anyone easily with the necessary time, trouble, inclination and sympathetic realisation of the Word of the Omniscient, any day, in any condition of life, in any part of the World.
To follow the Path, it is not necessary to be born a Jaina or to profess or embrace Jainism. Call yourself by whatever name you like, live your life as you have lived it hitherto, but if it is in accord with Jainism, if it conforms to the type and measure of faith, knowledge and conduct leading to the Goal, the soul may be sure that he or she is a Liberable being and on the Path to Truth, and Freedom from the miseries and limitations of embodied existence.
-You build yourself. The Soul is the sole architect of its life and condition, here and hereafter. As such, believers in Jainism and those who come to consider and weigh Jainism in their search after Truth will find this translation a valuable guide.

The mistakes in the matter and manner of the book are proofs of my incapacity to grasp and reflect even one distant broken ray of the great Sun of Omniscience, from which direct descent is rightly claimed by the book and its contents. In all humility, I beg to be pardoned for this; and the indulgent learned, I am sure, will forgive an ignorant and humble admirer of theirs for his inevitable shortcomings. Indeed all my Jaina writings are really a poorlyequipped student's First Notes. I am not a Samskrit or Prakrit Scholar. Then my excursions into Jainism have been few and occasional. But they have been always most honest, concentrated and with a soul eager and fully devoted to know the Truth of Jainism.
My aim has been not to justify or defend or even to explain Jainism; but simply to record its whole tradition in its entire purity.
In conclusion, I must thank Jaina Dharma Bhushana Brahma : chari Sital Prasada and Pandit Ajit Prasada, M. A., LL.B. for their unrepayable obligation upon me, in seeing the book through the Press at the cost of so much time and trouble.

INTRODUCTION,
The Name and Origin of the Book
Gommatasara.
The probable reasons for the name Gommatasara having been assigned to this authoritative work on Jain Philosophy may be summed up as below.
In the Karma Kanda Gatha 965, the author says that this treatise is based on the discourses of Shri Vardhamana, the 24th and the last Jain Tirthankara of the present era in Bharata Kshetra, and the teachings are also well established by the rules of logic, Pramana and Naya. The author has called Shri Vardhamana or Mahavira by the name of Gommatadeva.
The word Gommata is probably derived from " go" speech, and "mata" or "matha" abode, meaning "the Abode of Speech," the Lord from whom flows the letterless voice, the wonderful music. Divya-Dhvani. Sara means the essence, the condensed purport. The word Gommatasara would thus mean the " Essence of the Discourses of Lord Mahavira".
Again, we learn from the Samskrit commentary, that the treatise is a compilation of the answers given by the author Shri Nemi Chandra Siddhanta Chakravarti, to the questions put to him by Raja Chamunda Raya, asking him to enumerate the sub-classes of bodymaking Karma, and to explain their existence, bondage, non-bondage, and cessation of bondage, with regard to the spiritual stages of

souls in various conditions of life from the fine completely undevelopable vegetable bodied soul, to the fully developed rational fivesensed beings. The answers are based on the ancient manuscripts, Dhayala, Jaya Dhavala and Maha Dhavala, still preserved in needle pricked characters on palm-leaves in the Jain temple at Mudbidri, South Canara, India. The major part of Gommatasara is based on Dhavala, which was composed by Acharya Bhutabali about 7th century after Lord Mahavira.
Chamund Raya was also called Raja Gommata most probably on account of his great devotion to Shri Gommata Deva or Lord Mahavira. As a complement to the Great questioner, the compilation has been called Gommatasara after his name.
Chamunda Raya. Chamunda Raya was a brave general and a great minister of the Jain King Raja. Rajamalla who reigned from 974 to 984 A. C. (after Christ), and belonged to the Ganga dynasty.*
The ancestors of this Jaina dynasty ruled at Ayodhya, and were descended from the ancient Ikshwaku family, founded by Rishabhadeva, the first Tirthankara. Once it so happened, that Vijaya Maha Devi, wife of Raja Bharata, a descendant of the family, while pregnant, went to take a bath in the Ganges. A son was born to her there, and was on account of this circumstance, named Ganga Datta. He became a renowned King and the Dynasty was called Ganga-Vansha after his name. In this dynasty Maharaja Vishnu Gopa flourished at Ahichchatrapore (near Bareily, U. P.) He had two sons from his wife Prithvi-mati, named Bhagadatta and Shri Datta. Bhaga Datta went to the Kalinga country(near Orrissa),ruled there and established the Kalinga Ganga dynasty. Shri Datta continued to rule at Ahichchatra. Raja Padma Nabha was a descendent of his. He had two sons named Rama and Lakshman. In consequence of some dispute with Raja Mahipal of Ujjain (Malva), he had to leave Ahichchatra for Deccan with his sons, whose names he changed to Didiga and Madhava. They wert to Perur in District Codappa in the Madras Presidency and offered respects to the learned and spiritually advanced Acharya Sinha Nandi, who bestowed spiritual blessings on them. They established their power near Mysore in the second century after Christ. The 21st King in descent from Madhava who commenced to rule in 103 A.C. was Raja Malla II.
Chamunda Raya belonged to the clan of Brahma Khsatriya. He won many battles and received many titles, like Samara-Dhurandhara
* Mysore by Rice Vol. I.

"the leader in battle," Vira Martanda, "the sun among the brave," Rana Raja Sinha, "a great Lion in battle," Vairi Kula Kala Danda "The sceptre of death for the hosts of enemies," Bhuja Martanda "The sun among the powerful-armed." Samara Parshurama, "Parashurama in battle," Satya Yudhisthira, "Yudhisthira in speaking truth." He was great scholar also. He wrote a commentary* on Gommatasara, in the Canarese language in presence of the author Shri Nemi Chandra Siddhanta Chakravarti. He also composed Chamunda Rava Purana in Canarese and Charitra sara, a treatise on the practices of ascetics in Samskrit.
Appreciative mention of Raja Chamunda Raya has been made by the author in Karma Kanda Gatha 966 to 972. Raja Chamunda Raya took vows of a layman from the Great Saint Ajitasena, who was a disciple of the order of Acharya Aryasena, as stated in Gatha 734 of Jiva Kanda. Raja Chamunda Raya constructed a beautiful Jaina. Temple now called Chamunda Raya Basti at Chandragiri in front of Vindhvagiri at Shravana Belgula, district Hasan, Mysore, containing a beautiful image of Shri Nemi Nath to whom our author has offered obeisance on several occasions in Gommatasara.
He constructed in 983 A. C. the great and wonderful image of Shri Bahubali, called Gommata Swami, Gommateshvara, "the Lord of Gommata" after his name.
Bahubali was one of the sons of the first Tirthankara Rishabha Deva and ruled at Podnapore. He had a contest with his eldest brother Bharata and defeated him. But he felt so distressed on this account that he renounced all temporal power and adopted an ascetic life. He practised the severest austerities. He stood unmoved for a whole year, in the standing posture, in meditation, so deep and concentrated that creepers spread and entwined themselves round his legs and arms. He was the first who obtained omniscience in this Avasarpini cycle in Bharata Kshetra even before Lord Rishabha. His unsurpassed severe austerities have been very often extolled in Jaina Shastras. The wonderrul image at Vindhyagiri represents this exemplary attitude of meditation..
The grandeur of the Image, as also its serene-looking and peace-inspiring presence, are well-known to all Jainas and nonJainas who have had the good fortune of visiting it. When I visited the sacred place in 1910, I met some English men and women missionaries, who out of respect for the Holy Image took off their shoes and visited it in their bare feet. They also held the opinion
*Keshava Varni has based his Commentary on Gommatasara on this work.

which I have given above. The Image is about 57 feet high and still every limb and minor limb thereof is in exquisite proportion. It is impossible to convey its glory and artistic excellence by words. Any one who has the chance of seeing it personally will easily agree with the hitherto general opinion.
*
This gives an answer to some critics also who call the Jainas Idolatrous. The Jainas do not worship the stone, silver, gold or diamond of which the Images are made. They worship the qualities of Total Renunciation of the World, the Acquisition of undisturbable Harmony with the Infinite, and the Identity of the Liberated Soul with Peace everlasting, which these Images represent. Shakespeare with traduction :
Also to quote
"Ah me! how sweet is Jina itself possessed, When but Jina's shadows are so rich in joy!" (Romeo and Juliet),
Where I substitute "Jina " for "Love". It is clear how irresistible and experientially axiomatic must have been the Peace and Guidance given by the Arhats and Omniscients, when their mere Images are so potent of Grace, peace and inspiration.
So much for the origin of the name Gommatasara.
A noticeable feature about Gommatasara is that the Author has always followed the earliest known beacon-lights of Jainism, after Lord Mahavira's Moksha. The most known of these lights is Bhadrabahu(the 5th shruta-Kevali, 162 A.V., after Vardhamana). He was the preceptor of the Mauryan Emperor Chandragupta, who became a saint and was called Prabha Chandra and who renounced the body at Kata vapra Hill, Chandragiri, Shravanabelgula, just in front of the feet of the great Bahubali.
Shri Nemi Chandra also follows the tradition of Shri KundaKundacharya, who flourished in the first century B. C., V. S. 49 (vide Introduction to Panchastikaya S. B. J. Vol. III). As an authority on the learned Jain scriptures, he is next to Shri Gautama Ganadhara, the chief of all saints, who directly received the Discourses of Lord Mahavira, delivered from his unquivering lips in letterless voice and who expounded the principles of the Jaina religion. Shri Kunda-Kundacharya has composed among others, the wonderful works on Jaina Metaphysics called Samayasara, Niyamasara, Panchastikaya Samayasara and Pravachana Sara. He also followed the tradition of Uma Swami, who occupied the pontifical seat, after Shri Kunda Kunda-charya, and gave to the world the Jain Bible, Tatvartha Sutra.

The Author.
The age and the date, etc., of the author Shri Nemichandra Siddhanta Chakravarti need not be repeated here, as they are dealt with at length by the learned Professor S. C. Ghosal, M. A., LL. B., in the first volume of the Sacred Books of the Jainas, entitled Dravya Samgraha. He flourished about 1000 A. D.
Siddhanta Chakravarti.
The saintly author is called the Siddhanta Chakravarti, or the Emperor of Jaina Scriptures.
According to Jaina Geography, a Karma Bhumi (or region where human beings depend for their livelihood upon work, such as agriculture, etc.,) has six parts: One Arya Khanda or the part peopled by noble, religious and meritorious good people, and 5 Mlechchha Khandas, peopled by the rest of the inhabitants of the Karma Bhumi. The extreme Northern and Southern Countries, Airavata and Bharata respectively and 32 countries of Videha in the middle of Jambu Dvipa are such Karma Bhumis. A Chakravarti is the king of the Capital of Arya Khanda of Bharata or Airavata. He advances, and conquers all his neighbours, and by his prowess and piety brings all the 5 Mlechchha Khandas also under him and becomes the sole Emperor of all the six parts of Bharata Kshetra.
Similarly the Jaina scriptures are only an infinite expressed part of the inexpressible all-grasping omniscience, which comprehends all the attributes and all modifications of all substances in all ages, past, present and future, from beginningless time to endless Eternity. A very small account of these Scriptures is given in Jiva Kanda Gathas 348, etc., seqq.
Sri Nemichandra was the Siddhanta Chakravarti, because he had conquered all the realms of the known knowledge of the Sacred Books. He was called the Emperor because he had like a Chakravarti conquering the six parts of Bharata mastered the famous authoritative works Dhavala, etc., composed by Bhutabali and Pushpadanta, the disciples of Arahatbali some 7 century after Lord Mahavira which consists of 6 parts called "Jiva Sthana," "Kshudraka Bandha," "Bandha Swami," "Vedana khanda," "Vargana-Khanda and "Mahabandha." Gatha 397 of Karma Kanda may be quoted here. jh ckkenn y ckkii chkkhNdd saahiyN shrvigghenn  /  AC ALAEU AU g+ds' atfga aza || 380 |||
Just as a Chakravarti monarch conquers six parts of the country by his Chakra weapon, so I have mastered the six parts of Dhavala, etc., by my weapon of intellect.

His title is justified by his well-known books, Dravya Samgraha translated as volume I of the Sacred Books of the Jainas, "Gommatasara, Jiva Kanda and Karma Kanda, Labdhisara, Kshapanasara and the wonderful Trilokasara, a book on Jaina Cosmology, without a study of which it is impossible to understand Jainism in its minute details and classifications or its artistic and perfect solidarity.
His works deal mainly with Karnanuyoga, one of the four Vedas or Anuyogas of the Jaina Siddhanta, called Prathamanuyoga, Karnanuyoga, Charananuyoga, and Dravyanuyoga.
The Four Anuyogas.
1. Prathamanuyoga, History, the Part dealing with the ages and lives of the Great Personages of the World, specially with those of the 63 Great Persons (Shalaka-Purushas), i. e., the 24 Tirthankaras, the 12 Chakravartis, the 9 Narayanas, 9 Prati-Narayanas and the 9 Balabhadras..
2. Karnanuyoga, Cosmology, the Part dealing with Space, the Universe, the Non-Universe, the Three worlds, their description, dimensions and denizens and different calculations as regards spiritual stages and soul-quests.
3. Charananuyoga, Ritual, the part dealing with rules of conduct for laymen and for ascetics.
Of these the former are detailed in the eleven Pratimas or stages of restraint and renunciation of householders; the latter are the stricter and harder rules of greater and fuller restraint and renunciation for ascetics.
4. Dravyanuyoga, Philosophy, the part dealing with the substances. Primarily the substances are two: Soul and Non-soul. But they are enumerated six, as because the non-soul obviously consists of five independent and distinctly individual substances, Matter, Time, Space and the Media of Motion and Rest. Thus, there are six substances: Soul (Jiva), Matter (Pudgala), Time (Kala), Space (Akasha), Motion (Dharma), and Rest (Adharma).
Matter is of many kinds. But the most mighty kind is Karmic matter, which the mundane soul wears and which is the self-wound motor to keep the soul moving in "Samsara."
This connection of Soul and the Non-Soul matter necessitates a consideration of the inflow of Karma into soul, the bondage of soul by Karma, the stoppage of the inflow, the shedding of the bondage, and perfect freedom of the soul from Karma. These 7 are called the Tattvas or principles of Jainism. They are soul (Jiva), Non-Soul

(Ajiva), Asrava (Inflow), Bandha (Bondage), samvara (stoppage), Nirjara (Shedding), and Moksha (Liberation).
Omniscience, There is another way of glancing at the subject. As the six Khandas of one Karma Bhumi, huge as they are (the m of our Bharata Kshetra is about 21 lacs of miles with a length of about 5 crores and 81 lacs of miles), are nothing compared with Space or the universe, even so the works and knowledge of Sri Nemichandra, tremendous though they are, are really nothing in comparison with the whole knowledge, possessed by the Kevali Jina, the Omniscient Conqueror of Karmas.
Yet Shri Gommatasara Jiya Kanda is a good introduction to the Great Tattva, Soul (Jiva). "Know Thyself", has been the precept and practice of all serious searchers after the truth about Soul. Jainism is an uncompromising apotheosis of knowledge. And in a way in Jainism even Omniscience also is experiential, almost empi. rical. The Soul in Omniscient over flow (Kevala Samudghata) touches the universe.
This Omniscience again is a negation of Noetics. There is no Science or progression in Omniscience. It is just the seeing of the Whole Truth. It is a full and direct manifestation of the Soul. Knowledge is the essence of soul. There is no soul without knowledge. There is no knowledge or knowability without soul. Nonomniscience is merely a result of the soul being obscured by the conation-obscuring, and knowledge-obscuring (Darshanavarniya and Jnanavarniya) Karmas. These being destroyed, Omniscience, the real Natural characteristic of the Soul manifests itself.
There are infinite souls. Each one has infinite attributes and modifications in Space and Time. It is not easy to classify and analyse and describe them. Less than an Omniscient cannot do it. Less than an Omniscient can follow it only by faith and fragmentarily. Our puny measures of Logic, Science and popular Philosophy are as capable of measuring Omniscience, as our yards and inches are of measuring Space.
There are two ways known to us of having a very rough and remote Idea of Omniscience. One is by considering the exte early Jaina Sacred Literature which is mostly lost to-day; and the other and even a better one is by considering the Jaina theory of numbers. Both subjects are of high value, and immense use, and it is best to consider them here.

Early Jaina Sacred Literature. The knowledge of Shruti, Shruta-Jnana, may be of things which are contained in the Angas (Limbs or sacred books of the Jainas) or of things outside the Angas. There are 64 simple letters of the alphabet. Of these 33 are consonants, 27 vowels, and 4 auxiliary (which help in the formation of compound letters). The total number of possible combinations of these 64 simple letters into compounds of 2, 3, 4, or more up to 64 letters is:
24-1-1,84,46,74,40,73,70,95,51,615. These are the letters (simple and compound) of Shruta in its entirety. This number being divided by 16,348,307,888, which is the number of letters in a central foot (madhyama-pada) of the Paramagama, (Sacred Jaina Literature), gives us the number of padas of the Angas as 11, 283, 58, 005. The remainder 80,108,175, gives us the letters of that part of Shruta which is not contained in the Angas. This part is divided into 14 Prakirnakas.
1.-The Twelve Angas, The Angas are twelve, as follows:
1. The Achara-anga comprises a full exposition of the rules of conduct for ascetics. It contains 18,000 Madhyama Padas.
2. The Sutrakrita-anga comprises a detailed exposition of knowledge, humility, etc., of religious rites and difference between the rites of one's own religion and those of the other one-sided views. It contains 36,000 Madhyama Padas.
3. The Sthana-anga comprises an exposition of one or more sthanas, or numerical points of view in considering Jiva (Soul),Pudgala (Matter) and other Dravyas. While the Jiva-dravya, or soul. is from the point of view of consciousness one and the same everywhere; from the point of view of being liberated (siddha) or mundane (samsarin) it is of two kinds. Similarly, the samsarin, or mundane Jiva, that is, the soul not yet perfectly freed from the bondage of karmas, which keep it moving in the cycle of existences is of three kinds, one sensed, immobile (sthavara), not full-sensed (vikalendriya), and in possession of all the organs of the senses, full-sensed (sakalendriya). The liberated souls too, are of many kinds from the point of view of place, time, etc. This anga contains 42,000 M. padas.
4. The Samavaya-anga gives an account of the similarities that arise from the point of view of Dravya (elements of the universe), Kshetra (place), Kala (time), Bhava (character). From the

From a practical point, it absorbs the material Karmas and is material ; in reality it is immaterial. From both points of view it exists at all times and knows all the things of the past, present and future.

The third column of the brief statement of 21 kinds of numbers shows that really there are two unknown :-D. and M. Let us see what they are.
D, or Jaghanya Parita Asamahyata. To find D. i. e., Jaghanya Parita Asamkhyata. Let there be four pits each of 1 lac Yojanas in diameter, and
1000 Yojanas deep and called : Anavastha .... (d') Shalaka
... (BI) Pratishalaka
.. (Y ) Mahashalaka
... (X) Fill d' with round rape-seeds; overfill it from its mouth surface
in a regular conical form, the apex of which is one rape seed; as
The number of seeds in the pit is 197912092999)
680000000000000000 000000000000000
|(31 zeroes).
The number in the cone above 179920084545163
63636363636363631
246 figs.
636363636363636-4 (16 thirty sixes). The total seeds are 1997112938 45 1316363636363636363) 46
636363636363636 4 figs.
Say Z For this filling of di, drop one seed in B1
Then take up the seeds from b , and drop one seed on each of the continents and Oceans beginning with Jambudvipa. Where the last seed is dropped, it would be an Ocean, (disregard the 411 seed, which will not be in the Cone). Now dig a pit of the diameter of this Ocean, of the same depth, in e., 1000 Yojanas, Call it d2: and fill it in with rape seeds like a topping Cone, as di was filled in. Then drop another rape seed in B for the filling of do.
Then take up the seeds from de and drop one each on the Continents and Oceans beginning with the Continent next to the Ocean where the last seed from di was dropped, whereever in a continent or Ocean the last seed of d? is dropped, take the diameter of that as the diameter of the next pit di which is also 1000 Yoianas deep. Fill it up conically liked and d' . For the filling of ds. drop a third rape seed into B'.
Repeat till Bi is filled in the usual top Conical form. The number of seeds in B1 is =Z; and much larger in each of the pits di to da successively, because their diameters are much larger at each step.

For the filling of B: drop a seed in V. Repeat the same process of dropping one seed on each Continent and Ocean, beginning from the one next to where the last seed from the last Z pit was dropped. The next pit L2 +1 will be 1000 Yojanas deep and with a diameter of the Continent or Ocean where the last seed from the L z pit was dropped. Go on till there are Z pits of the L class with ever-increasing diameter. When the last pit i. e., Lz is exhausted, drop one seed in Y.
Now Y' is also conically filled. Then drop the first seed in X. Repeat till X is also filled. Then the number of L pits will be Z. The number of seeds in the last of these Z3 pits is the number D or Jaghanya Parita Asamkhyata. In other words, Dno of rape-seeds in the (Z ) th pit, where Z is 46 figures, ante and where each Continent and Ocean in the width of its ring is double of its immediate predecessor, and never more than only one seed is dropped on each. In other words still. To find D. i. e., Jaghanya Parita - Asamkhy Take a pit of the diameter of Jambudvipa i.e., of 1 lac Yojanas and of 1000 Yojanas depth. Fill it with round rape seeds; over fill it from its mouth surface in a regular conical form, the apex of which
is one rape seed; as 1
... 45 fig.
The number of seeds in the pit is
,, ,, ,, in the cone above is
... 46 fig.
The total seeds are
... 46 fig.
Say Z. Now there are innumerable Continents & Oceans in the Middle World (Madhya Loka). Each Continent is surrounded by a ring of an Ocean, which in its turn is ringed round by a Continent. Also the width of the ring of each Continent & Ocean is double the width of the ring of its iminediately preceding Ocean and Continent.
Now we take the Z seed out of our first pit, and drop one seed, on each of the Continents and Oceans beginning with Jambu Dvipa. Where the last seed is dropped, it would be an Ocean. Now dig a pit of the diameter of this Ocean. Fill it with rape-seeds in the form of a topping Cone as before.
Take the seeds out of it and proceed to drop one each beginning from the Continent next to the Ocean which gave us the Diameter of this 2nd pit. Then wherever you drop the last seed of this 2nd

pit, take the diameter of that Continent or Ocean for a fresh pit, which is to be filled conically as before and the seeds from which are also to be disposed of as before.
Go on doing this for Z times; The number of seeds in the last i. e. (Z ) th pit is-D.
The imaginary dropping of rape-seeds on the Continents and Oceans serves the purpose of showing.
(1) the tremendous extent of the area of the Middle
World ; (2) the real character of the Jaina Mathematical ideal of
an innumerable number, which although innumerable
is still not infinite; and (3) the tremendous, soul-staggering extent of Omniscience. To find G-Jaghanya Yukta Asamkhyata. Take D and virlana it, or spread it into its units; i.e., write down as many ones as there are units in D. On the top of each one, place a D (called Deya). Multiply all together. The product is DD. This is equal to G. This is the number of instants (samayas) in an avali or wink. In other words G=DO,
M. or Jaghanya Parita-Ananta. Now we come to the other great unknown M. To find MJaghanya Parita Ananta.
Take Jaghanya Asamkhyata, Asamkhyata,J.,which is-G' _D2 D
Treat it to the third degree of Shalaka-Virlana-Deya, as below. In Shala ka Virlana-Deya, there are always three dispositions of the number treated. The first is called Shala ka. The number is kept in this and is reduced by one at each completion of process in the next two dispositions. The second disposition is called Virlana. In this one is placed in as many places as there are units in the number. The third disposition is Deya. It is the number which is given to be placed on the top of every unit in the Virlana. The first Deya is always the number itself.
Let us treat 3 by this method. We place 3 as Shalaka. We place 3 ones under Virlana ; and the Deya is 3.
In the Virlana on the top of each 1 we place 3. We multiply all these threes and get 3x3x3 - 27. This is the next Deya, Now we reduce the Shalaka by one. So at the second step we have 2 as

26
Shalaka ; 27 ones as Virlana; and 27 as Deya. The next Deya would be 2727. Now we reduce the Shalaka by another one. So at the third step we have 1 as as Shalaka ; 2727 ones as Virlana, and 2727 as Deya. The next Deya or the result of
27
37
Virlana is
Now we can reduce the Shalaka by
one more
27
7 27
The process is complete. The result
Let us express it symbolically thus: 2710, which means that 27 is to be written four times, once as a base, then as a power of that base, then as a power of that power and so on.
If we take the last result, i.e. 2710, and treat it by the Shala ka method as we treated the three above, it would be a two-fold treatment, Thus : take 27 and treat it as Shala ka, virlana, Deya. Virlana 274 and place on the top of each unit of the Virlana process the number272),multiply all these27) together and now reduce one out of the Shalaka number 2711). The product of this multiplication should be considered as the next Virlana and Deva Virlana this virlana into separate units and place on the top of each unit, the Deya thus obtained. Multiply together all these Deya Then reduce one more from our Shalaka 27177. Consider the product of this second multiplication to be the next virlana and Deya ; Virlana it as before and place on the top of each virlana unit this product and multiply all these Deya together and then again subtract one from our Shalaka
7171; proceed serially in the same way considering the ever and ever increasing new and new product of each multiplication as virlana and Deya; and go on virlaning and multiplying together the new ever-increasing product of the multiplication at each step reducing one at a time from 27,1!, until the whole Shalaka 2714 is totally exhausted ; thus we reach the end of the two-fold treatment. The result of this second treatment also being treated in the Shalaka way will give us the third degree Shalaka treatment of 3 i. e.. the huge product of the multiplication at the end of the second Shalaka treatment should be treated and considered as the new and fresh Shalaka virlana and Deya ; and it should be exhausted exactly as above by successive virlana and Deya, placing Deya on each unit and then multiplying all Deya together and then reducing one from this Shalaka on each multiplication of all the Deya. This is

technically called Shalaka-Traya-Nisthapana. The result of treating J like this is a kind of K. To this result add the following six :1. The innumerable spatial units of the substance of motion (Dharma Dravya).
2. The innumerable spatial units of the substance of Rest (Adharma Dravya).
3. The innumerable spatial units of one soul (ek Jiva Dravya). 4. The innumerable spatial units of the Universe-Space (Lokakacha).
5. Innumerable x innumerable spatial units of the Universe, i.e. the number of non-host individual souls (Apratisthita Pratyeka).
6. Innumerable x innumerable spatial units, i.e. the number of host individual souls (Sapratisthita Pratyeka). Take the total of these 7 and treat it to Shalaka-Traya-nisthapana as above. The result is again a kind of K. To this add the following four :
1. Instants of one Kalpa or a cycle of Avasarpini and Utsarpini (the instants of 20 crore x crore sagaras of years).
2. Innumerable x innumerable spatial units of the Universe, i.e. the number of thought-activities of the soul which determine the duration of bondage of Karmas (Sthiti-bandha Adhyavasaya Sthana).
3. Innumerable x innumerable spatial units of the Universe, i.e. the number of degrees of passion which determine the intensity, or the mild or strong fruition, of bondage of Karmas (Anubhagabandha-Adhyavasaya Sthana).
4. Innumerable innumerable spatial units of the Universe, i.e. the number of the units of soul's vibratory activities (Avibhaga pratichchheda of Yoga).
Take the total of these five and treat it to Shalaka TrayaNisthapana as above. The result is equal to M.
To find U-Utkrista Ananta-Ananta.
Take S. Treat it to Shalaka-Traya-Nisthapana. The result is a kind of T. To this add the following six :
1. Infinite part of all souls, i.e., the number of liberated souls (Siddhas).
2. Infinite above, i. e. the number of common or groupsouled vegetable (sadharana vanaspati nigoda) souls (i.e. all the mundane souls, except the earth, water, fire, air, and individual or one-souled vegetable, and mobile souls).

3. Infinite x above, i.e. the number of all vegetable souls
(Vanaspati). 4. Infinite x all souls, i. e. the number of atoms of matter
(Pudgala). 5. Infinite x infinite matter-atoms, i.e., number of instants
in Practical Time (Vyavahara Kala). 6. Infinite xinfinite instants in Practical Time, i. e.; the
number of spatial units in the non-universe space (Aloka
kasha). Take the total of these seven and treat it to shala ka-TrayaNishthapana. The result is a kind of T. To this add the infinitex the infinite which is the number of units (Avibhaga Pratichchheda) of the individuality attribute (Aguru-laghu-guna) in the substances of Motion and Rest (Dharma and Adharma Dravya).
Take the total of these two, and treat it to Shalaka-Traya-Nishthapana. The result is a kind of T.
Subtract this from the number of units (Avibhaga Pratichchheda) of perfect knowledge (Kevala Jnana); and then add it to the remainder.
Thus the number of units of perfect knowledge is U.
This last subtraction and addition of the same is to show that even this last kind of T, soul-straining though it is, is nothing compared with U, Omniscience, which is the goal and glory of Jainism, being the highest and the most Ideal condition of the Purest possible soul.
Note that the expression "innumerable x innumerable," and "infinitex infinite" is employed above, because the innumerables and the infinites are not the same. By this time it will be clear that there are a huge number of these innumerables and infinites in the Middle kinds, included in E. H. K. and in N. Q. and T.
(See Triloka Sara Gathas 9 to 52).

The contents of Gommatasara. This book is really a very brief and hasty glance at the Great Theme, a feeble human effort to give a rough idea of the soul-astounding extent of Divine Ominscience. It confines itself to a short account of Spritual Stages and Soul-quests which are the wellknown Jaina ways of the considering the soul.
Jiva Kanda is only the first part of the great work Gommatasara; the second part being the Karma Kanda. The two Parts together are a brief expansion and explanation of the beautiful little Dravya Samgraha, by the same author. Jivamajivam Davvam (tara ze), the living and the non-living substances are the opening words of (Dravya Samgraha). Gommatasara simply deals with these two mighty categories with the living soul in the Jiva Kanda, and with the non-living Karmic matter in the Karma Kanda.
Dravya Samgraha is the merest enumeration of the topics of Jainism with their main divisions and sub-divisions. It consists 58 Gathas and 5 Parts. Part I. Substances. The Mundane Soul. Gathas 1 to 14. ,, II. The Non-soul ; Matter; Motion ; Rest; Space; and Time.

Impulse (Sanjna): and (14) Soul-quests (Margana); also (12 kinds of) Conscious Attentiveness (Upayoga); respectively have been described (in) 20 chapters.
NOTE:In the 20 chapters, the 14 soul-quests alone form 14 chapters, the others take one chapter each. Gatha 4 tells us how Soul-classes, Developableness, Vitalities, Rationality and Attention are included in the 14 Quests, and therefore the chief considerations in treating of the soul are,
14 Spiritual stages, the degree to which the mundane soul has
advanced in its freedom from wrong-belief, vowless
ness, negligence, passions and vibratory activity; and 14 Soul-quests, the conditions, circumstances, and equip
ments which help us to identify the soul when we are seeking to mark it in the infinity of mundane exis
tences. These 2 are also interconnected. The stages classify the soul briefly; the quests take them up in greater detail (See Gatha 3).
The stages are named in Gathas, 9-10; mincho saasnn misso avirdsmmo y desvirdo y  /  virdaa pmtt idro apuc anniyhi suhmo y  //  6 //  ubsNt khiinnmoho sjogkvlijinno ajogii y  /  cuds jiivsmaasaa kmenn siddhaa y nnaadvvaa  //  10 // 
The English translation is :
Delusion (Mithyatva); Downfall (Sasadana); mixed (Mishra), and vowless right belief (Avirata Samyaktva), Partial-vow (DeshaVirata); imperfect vow (Pramatta-Virata), the other, perfect vow (Apramatta-Virata), New thought activity (Apurva Karana), Advanced thought-activity (Anivritti Karana), slightest Delusion (Sukshma Samparaya), Subsided-delusion (Upashanta Moha), Delusionless (Kshina Moha), Vibratory omniscient conqueror (Sayoga Kevali Jina), and non-vibratory omniscient (Ayoga-Kevali), these 14 should be known to be the spiritual stages (Gunasthana), one after another. After the last, the soul becomes liberated (Siddha).
The Quests are given in Gatha 142:giiNdiyesu kaaye joge vede ksaaynnaanne y  / 
sNjmdNsnnlessaa bhviyaasmmttsnninnaahaare  //  142  //

The English translation is :
The fourteen-soul-quests are:-1 Conditions of existence(Gati), 2 Sense (Indriya). 3 Embodiment (Kaya), 4 Vibratory activity (Yoga), 5 Sex-inclination (Veda), 6 Passion (Kashaya), 7 Knowledge (Jnana) 8 Control (Samyama), 9 Conation (Darshana). 10 Thought-paint (Leshya), 11 Capacity of Liberation (Bhavya), 12 Right-belief (Samyaktva). 13 Rationality (Samjnitva), and 14 Assimilation of matter (Ahara).
The stages and quests, with their many divisions and sub-divisions, and inter-connections (these are specially treated in the two Appendices, Gathas 677-734), really exhaust the point of view from which souls in the world may be viewed. Our matter-mad, mammonmad world may blind us to Truth. But the sign-posts on the path to it, though deserted and neglected still shine with their eternal splendour and are unerring guides to the soul who understands itself and cares to tread the hard and lonely but sure path to freedom unending and bliss everlasting. Shri Nemichandra has not erected these sign-posts. He is eager and careful to tell us at each step "The Conqueror has said so" "the All-knowing has described it;" etc. The passions and the cease-less vibrations are the primary and essential cause of stages and these and the operation of other Karmas that of quests. The soul who wants to know itself will soon see its thraldom to the Passion of Anger, Pride, Deciet and Greed, and Sleep and Attachment and their innumerable combinations. Here as everywhere else in Jainism, there is no room for unreasoned faith. If anyone claims this and frightens away the earnest inquirers, it is not the fault of Jainism. It is a gross misunderstanding, and misrepresentation of Jainism. It is fouling one's own nest. True Jainism does not want blind faith. It wants knowledge of Universal principle. Nay, More. It wants realisation and application of this knowledge to the tears and smiles of our neighbours, to the dew and sun on the red rose, to the rainbow on the sky, to the roaring torrents of the Niagara, to the fury of the floods and famines in our Motherland, India, and to the solution of the soul-racking problems of Economics and Politics in Europe and America. No corner of the Universe, no condition of life, no modification in our finest tremor of the mind or soul, no change of form in lifeless matter anywhere nothing is hidden from Jainism. Nothing is exempt from the Sovereign Law of Causation, from the unconquerable Rigour of Karma. The Stages and Quests of the soul here below are entirely due to this. The omniscients of old, the saints, with souls which were purer than the purest ideals concievable by men, and stronger

than adamant in their body and more lustrous in the Light of their souls than the sun or many suns,-these saints saw these Eternal Principles of Life and embodied them in their teachings. These teachings are for all souls high or low, in all ages and in all climes. There is no barrier of casts, creed or colour to their investigation and adoption. The greater part of Jaina literature is still unpublished. Therefore its lustre is not shed all over the world. Therefore the whole of humanity is in the iron-grip of war, of trade-jealousy and trade-deciet, of pain and selfishness, of dejection, disappointment and fear.
Popular Aspect of the Philosophy in the Book.
Evidently in Religion and Philosophy there is no greater concept than Soul ; and in the whole world there is no greater phenomenon than life.
This book throws a flood of light on the question of Living beings as we know them and how they may reach their ideal - Nirvana.
Living man as we see him is obviously a combination of two distinct substances ; Living and Non-living. Let us consider these.
At the outset one marvellous thing is noticeable. We do see purely non-living things, as the pen with which I am writing or the paper which you are reading. But pure life is never met with in the world. So the position really is that we have :
(1) Living substance mixed with non-living substance; and
(2) Non-living substance.
There is non-living matter in both. But in one there is life also; in the other, not.
Vitalities. Another important and useful fact is the fact of death,
It is not annihilation of anything, soul or matter. It is only a separation of the outer body from the soul, which is still combined with two material but fine bodies. It is only when soul obtains
ratoin, that it becomes permanently pure and completely rid of all combination with matter. By careful comparison we can find a trace to the characteristic features of life and its differences from lifelessness.
The first thing we notice in one, who was living but is dead now, is that his senses do not act. He cannot touch, taste, smell, see or hear. He has no vitality of the senses. Also he is powerless. He cannot act, speak or think. He has no force, no vitality of body, speech or mind. But many of these things may be absent

also in a living man who is asleep, in a trance or otherwise unconscious. Therefore all over the world we examine the man's respiration. If it is there, we say, "he still lives." If not, we say "he has breathed his last." So Spencer speaks of Death as "nought but parting of the breath." Faerie Queene, book 7, canto 7, stanza 46. This respiration is a sure sign of life. It is also popular speech to say of a dead man," he has numbered his days"; "his time has come" etc. Without going into the insoluble mysteries of metaphysics, in the above common observations, which may be made anywhere and at any time and by anyone, we have the surest and most self-evident distinction between living and lifeless objects. If we can believe in the testimony of our own immediate observation, confirmed by the fact that the experience of every other thinking being is exactly the same, we must sum up the distinction between living and non-living substances thus. A non-living substance does not have,
(1) The Vitality of the 5 senses ; (2) The Power of body, speech and mind ; (3) Respiration; and
(4) Age.
These four may be called the four (or with their sub-divisions ten) vitalities of living beings.
But it is noticeable that all these four or ten are also a manifestation of one underlying real fact; viz. that of consciousness. In a dead body the sense-organs are there and the eye may be impressed with colour and form as before, but there is no consciousness behind it which in life received, and recorded, and responded to the Ocular stimulus. The four or ten Vitalities are sure signs to dtstinguish the living from the non-living ; but in reality it is consciousness which distinguishes life from lifelessness.
Too much and too careful thought cannot be given to this Consciousness. If we do not understand it, we shall wander from the truth. Let us, therefore, try to gain further insight into this consciousness.
Consciousness. Attention. Knowledge. We often pass through a street without seeing or hearing things which are present before the eye and the ear. A man spoke; but we say, "I am sorry, I did not hear him." The speech was there: the sound waves impinged on the ear and yet we did not hear. Why ? simply because we were absorbed otherwise. We were not. ie.. our consciousness was not, attentive to it. This Attentiveness

of consciousness is another great distinction between the living and the lifeless. This attentiveness, of course, will be of as many different sorts as there are activities of the senses, mind and the soul, of which we can be conscious. We can be conscious of an object of sight, or of the other four senses ; or of the soul itself directed to a material object or to its own Omniscience. Thus our Attention also may be directed towards an ocular, or non-ocular object, or towards the soul directly knowing a material object or full of its own Omniscience.
Notice also, that of necessity, this Attention is essential to any kind of Knowledge. As a matter of fact, if we subject any piece of our knowledge to deep analysis we can note the following stages.
1. To begin with there is consciousness itself. This is the centre of life. It is life itself. It is the first and unmistakeable characteristic of what is called soul.
2. It must be Attentive to conate an object, i.e., to be inclined towards an object, i.e., to be merely turned towards it.
3. It must conate the object, i.e., it must be aware that some object is present there, without determining anything more about in the least.
4. Then it must attend to know that object in however slight a detail. This is the Attentiveness which must proceed knowledge.
* 5. Then a detail is grasped and knowledge begins, when we know a thing, we are not conscious of these 5 steps. But since our birth we are so much habituated to gain knowledge by means of our senses and mind, that these 5 steps are a sort of reflex or automatic, unconscious action of our busy consciousness. When we walk even for miles, or see with our eyes, or wink or breathe, or our blood courses in the body-we are seldom conscious of any of these things. They are familiar, habituated, and reflex or unconcious actions, and therefore unobserved. But their stages are all the same there. The alternate balancing of the whole body on one foot, th bending forward, then balancing on the other and so on; the closing of the eyelid to protect the eye; the inhalation of air to supply the lungs with oxygen, the exhalation to put forth foul carbonic acid gas, etc., each little action with its minute process and delicate machinery is going on without our attending to it, consciously. Infinitely, more delicate and unobserved are the myriad th our mind, which we call our channel of knowledge Only an Omniscient can see the millions of regular, natural processes by which the smallest particle of knowledge is called into being. Familiarity

has bred indifference amounting to ignorance in us. This psychic factory is within our own bodies.
Take an example :- 1. You are reading these words before your eyes, if you are dead and unconscious you can never read the words although they are before your eyes. There is no consciousness there. To be able to read you must have consciousness
If your thoughts are away, e.g. a siren song from your neighbour fascinates you and you are all ear to it. You cannot read these words, for your consciousness is not Attentive to the words. So attention is needed.
3. When your attention is drawn to the words in the first instance, there is merely a conation of them. You are merely conscious that something, not words, but merely something is there. This is conation (Darshana). This precedes knowledge. But it is most difficult to detect it or to describe it. It is itself an indescribable stage of consciousness touching a knowable object. It is merely a sort of is-ness of something of which your attentive consciousness is aware. It is not knowledge; nor even the beginning of knowledge. It is merely a preliminary, but a necessary prelimi. nary, to knowledge.
4. After this conation by attentive consciousness, the consciousness is directed to know the thing. The first instant witnesses the Attention of the consciousness shifted from conation to knowled This attentiveness is the beginning of knowledge. After this, knowledge begins. These stages are exceedingly difficult to analyse. Very profound, patient and long practised self-analysis is needed to perfectly verify them. But they are there. They may be sensed satisfactorily by any one who gives sober, serious and staid thought to the grasping of them.
From being aware of the mere is-ness of something in the paper before you, you instantly are conscious that there are some sort of letters there. Your mind questions? What kind of letters ?
The next instant answers: letters of the English Alphabet. You impress this on your mind and record and retain it there for future use. This is useful to you on future occasions. You may remember it, you may recognise it by seeing these very words again or by seeing some others similar or dissimilar to them. You may collect together many records like this and build up an induction on the basis of them. From your induction you may deduce inferences.

From all the above knowledge about the words you are reading, you may lead yourself on to a knowledge of something else which is not in the words themselves. So from the mere sense of having seen the words, i. e. from a merely sensitive knowledge about them you may go on to think that they are philosophical symbols and exclaim with Milton:
"How charming is divine philosophy,
Nor harsh and crabbed, as dull fools suppose, But musical as is Apollo's lute,
And a perpetual feast of nectared sweets, Where no crude surfeit reigns". Comus 11,476-480.
If you analyse your experience about these words you will easily perceive no less than thirteen distinct stages in it. 1. Consciousness (Chetana). 2. Attention (Upa-yoga) of this consciousness towards the conating (Darshana) of these words. 3. Conation (Darshana) itself i.e. the awareness that something is there, 4. Attention (Upa-yoga) of consciousness to know (Jnana) and to see. 5. Actual sight, (Avagraha) the preception that there is something like words there. 6. The desire (iha) to know further the question what letters are these. They seem to be English. It is the process through which mere preception is transmuted into judgment; it is the conception and comparison or pre-judgment or ratiocination. 7. The judgment, (Avaya), The answer; they are English letters. The retention (Dharana), the fixing of the judgment in the mind. 9. The memory (Smriti) of the words. 10. Their recognition (sanjna). 11. The Induction (chinta) from them. 12. The deduction( Abhinibodha) and 13. The Scriptural knowledge (Shruta) i. e. the extra knowledge of other things derived through the sight of the script of the letters.
It is easy to see that the first four are pre-knowledge stages; and the next eight from 5th to 12th are stages of degrees of sensitive knowledge, and the last is inferential knowledge, which may be termed Scriptural knowledge.
Consciousness may further know things directly without the intermediation of the senses or the mind. The soul itself may visualise matter directly or may visualise the impressions about it in the mind of another. This kind of knowledge is very rare and can be understood only after great profound study and longlived life of controlled discipline and purity. Still more difficult to understand is Omniscience. I shall try to take the reader up to it gradually, provided he is patient and dispassionately in search of Truth, and

not in the hurry to criticise, or dogmatise, to say "What is Truth,'' and then Pilate-like to go away,
8 kinds of knowledge. One thing I may here say, although it is obvious that Sensitive and Scriptural knowledge may go wrong. Even Visual knowledge (direct vision of matter by the soul) may go wrong but direct Mental knowledge of the mind of others and Perfect knowledge or Omniscience cannot go wrong. Thus we may be said to have come to 8 kinds of knowledge; five right and the first three wrong also.
These are the first batch of considerations of the great fact of consciousness in living matter. And we must remember that each kind of conscious activity has its preliminary Attentiveness.
Thus we may sum up. Consciousness is Attentiveness of Conation or of Knowledge, or Conation or Knowledge itself. Conation is for Ocular, (Chakshu), Non-ocular (Achakshu), Visual (Avadhi), or Perfect (kevala) Knowledge.
Knowledge is Sensitive( Mati),Scriptural(Shruta),Visual( Avadhi), Mental(Manah Paryaya) or Perfect (Kevala), also wrong Sensitive (Ku-Mati), wrong Scriptural (Ku-Shruta), and wrong Visual(KuAvadhi)Knowledge.
Let us illustrate again. Consciousness which is the mighty, real characterstic of life is the starting point. You must be alive to read these words. You must be attentive to feel that something is there. You must conate these words. Then again you must be attentive to perceive, then alone you begin to know them, i.e. have perception, conception, judgment, retention, memory, recognition, induction, or deduction from them.
Roughly it may be said that attentiveness for conation or knowledge of any kind is the first instant of conation or knowledge. As the name implies it is the instant in which consciousness attends to conate or know an object. Also obviously conation is a necessary preliminary to knowledge.
Consciousness is the most essential difference between the Living and Non-Living. It deservedly detained us for a moment. But we must attend once more to a distinction between the two mighty categories, the Living and the Non-living Substances.
We have seen that the first distinction is that the Living has and the Non-living does not have the four or ten vitalities of the five senses; the power of mind, speech and body; respiration ; and age. We found the second distinction to be attentiveness of consciousness to four kinds of conation, Ocular, Non-ocular, Visual and Perfect; and to eight kinds of knowledge, Sensitive, Scriptural,

and Visual of the right as well as wrong, Mental and Perfect, of the right (kind only.)
The Soul and the Body. We also saw that although Non-living substance is found in fair abundance around us, living substance always seems to be mixed up with non-living matter in the world. Popular phraseology teaches us to call this non-living sheath of the living consciousness, its "body". "One body, one soul " seems to be the general motto of the universe. There are exceptions, but they need not detain us here. Botanical and other Scientific researches have taught us the learning of parasits and their hosts; so one body becomes the lodging of many souls. But to stick to popular parlance, one unified, individual consciousness forms the ego or soul or "I" and it fills one body. The crudest observation shows that this consciousness has the capacity of completely filling the size of its particular body. The elephant has a conscious individual soul ; so has an ant. So we may note as the third distinction between life and lifeless matter that life has the capacity of completely filling its lifeless sheath with consciousness, or in other words, or being coextensive with its body.
Notice also that the same grows fat on high living, or grows thin by disease. Indeed the little new-born baby becomes a big boy, then a bigger powerful man, and then a weak, emaciated old man; yet all through, the same one individual consciousness completely fills the body in its different sizes. The soul is capable of contraction and expansion.
The Soul Arts and Enjoys. Look at the living-non-living mixture from another point of view. We attribute activity and enjoyment to it. We say of a man's act: What a good or bad thing he has done. When a man acts without restraint or rashly and comes to grief, we say: this is the fruit of his folly." If a man is good, and prosperous, we say: "Oh! he does deserve it all and more." These popular phrases really have a philosophical significance. They attribute responsibility and reward to our consciousness. They imply that this consciousness is an active, responsible agent; is the Doer of all actions; and is the Enjoyer of the fruits of these actions, good or bad.
It is necessary to remember these, lest we should fall into the error of exempting the soul, ego or individual consciousness from all responsibility for his actions, good or bad, and thus at one stroke uproot all ethical distinctions and fullstop to discriminate actions.

We must also draw a distinction between the actions and the inner activity, to which these external actions are due. From the practical point of view we must emphasise the external actions, and from the real point of view their causes in the inner activity of our consciousness. But the responsible agent of both these is the individual consciousness itself.
Consciousness is as such purely itself, i.e. quite separate from matter which is unconscious, lifeless. From this pure or real point of view, we may say that all action and enjoyment of the soul is within its own consciousness.
The Soul is Immaterial.
Once more let us compare our categories, the Living and Nonliving. The most obvious form of non-living substance is matter; as iron, dry wood, sapphire, stone wall, key of our lock, our table, chair and innumerable other objects conveniently handy for this investigation to anyone at all times and at all places. That is the chief characterstic of this mass of matter of so many kinds? It is obviously this: It can be known by the senses. It has colour; we can see that coal is black; sapphire is blue; gold is yellow, ruby is red; and snow is white.
Again if we taste various kinds of matter we find that pepper is pungent, that aloes is bitter, that salt is saline, that the juice of an unripe mango is acid, and that sugar is sweet. Again rose essence smells sweet, Sulphur does not smell nice. Also, iron is cold, dry wood is not compared with iron; silk is smooth; sand is rough; cotton is soft; stone is hard; a feather is light and lead is heavy. We can sum up these 5 colours, five tastes, two smells and eight touches as the more obvious characteristics of lifeless matter. None of these twenty is found to characterise Consciousness, or pure life. Of course when life is mixed with non-living matter, it assumes all these distinctions of colour, taste, smell, and touch. Thus embodied consciousness does have colour, taste, etc. Soul is not matter. Byron rightly said that is the matter never mind him what is the mind, no matter. By "mind" we must mean the taking Ego, the soul.
Possibility of Omniscience.
This point is radical and deserves a little more consideration. Above we have seen vitalities, attention, conation, knowledge, doing and enjoying, and co-extension with the body to be the observed characteristics of the living substance. Here we may pause for a moment to consider these characteristics also. They were all

derived from our observation of a dead corpse and a living reader of these words. In the corpse, we simply noted the absence of the living and thus indirectly inferred that what was absent, belonged to and was taken away by the living substance when it left the corpse lifeless. The living reader gave us mostly the psychic stages of conation and knowledge. But in all these we are not able to study or observe pure life. Indeed it must be confessed frankly that there is absolutely no means at present of our studying life or soul directly and fully in its pure condition without any admixture of matter in it. We are in the world. There is no pure soul in this world of ours. All are embodied or mundane souls. In studying them, except in abstract thought, we cannot separate the living soul from its sheath of non-living matter, i. e., the body. But the living embodied soul also can exhibit in the world such a high degree of manifestation of pure life and independence of nonliving matter, that we can form a very near idea, of a pure perfect soul. As we approach that idea we find that vitalities, and responsibility for doing and enjoying shrink more and more; and that conation and knowledge correspondingly increase in purity, extent, depth and fineness. From this it is justifiable to conclude that the ultimate idea of a perfect soul, i.e., the ideal soul will be identical with an individual consciousness which has perfect conation and perfect knowledge with their attendant perfect power and perfect bliss. Also that this stage must mean total separation or liberation from matter. Thus alone from a consideration of the obvious categories, of the living substance and non-living substance, gradually, and after very deep, persistent, patient, difficult, and long study and contemplation we can arrive at a conception of a Pure Soul, the Highest Self, the Ideal, God, or whatever other name you like.
Living substance rises higher and higher towards the condition of matterless living, and ultimately, when perfectly rid of matter, it attains an eternal condition of Pure Light in Self-Absorption and by nature ascends upwards to the top of universe.
There is no turning back, and no further bondage with matter, and no transmigrations. Its modifications there, consist of its own perpetual self-modification. It has perfect conation and perfect knowledge. It is itself. It is liberated. It is Pure Soul.
But excepting this condition of absolute purity, the soul's own pure qualities are effected by those of matter. So we find that attention, conation and knowledge, which are pure consciousness or its modifications, are observed in a mundane or embodied soul, to

exist along with vitalities, and the size of the body, and are responsible for sowing and reaping the fruit of action, which are the characteristics of the living being united with the non-living matter and with touch, taste, smell and colour the pure characterstics of non-living matter.
The whole picturesque and endless variety of life, - physical, mental and emotional life in the universe is the effect and summation of infinite ways in which the Living unites with the Nonliving.
Let us try to consider this glorious wealth of variegated life of souls in the universe. The whole universe is packed full of living creatures. Indeed in such out-of-the-way and unexpected places, does our knowing intelligence light upon life, that some Great Intellects have gone the length of saying that all is Life and there is no lifeless matter at all. This of course is easily refuted by common, everybody, universal observation. In comprehending the almost incomprehensible vastnesses of space and time and their contents let us keep a cool and dispassionate head lest in our admiration of one or other of the several constituents of the universe, we should deny one or more and thus cripple our further and full knowledge of the whole truth of things. Indeed the checking of our premises and first conclusions again and again is absolutely essential if we, imperfect human beings, want to gain right knowledge. The search after Truth is not a child's play: the path to it is more narrow to traverse than the passage of the camel through the eye of the needle in the Bible.
The universe, then, teems with infinite living forms. How to observe, analyse, and classify them, so that we can advance on the path of our tremendous, trackless inquiry?
I propose to take this matter up in three different ways.
1. Souls classes (Jiva Samasa). There are obvious differences of body, sense and mind in different classes of souls: The body is primarily the basis of this classification. This in Jainism is technically called soul-classes. (Jiva Samasa).
2. Soul-quest (Margana). It comprises other inner differences in species, sex, passion, knowledge, conation etc., - In soul-quest, the embodied condition of the soul, (i.e.) the mixed living and nonliving condition is primarily the basis.
3. Spiritual Stages (Gunasthana). They concern the purelyinner progress of the soul. In these spiritual stages, the progress of the soul from ignorance and delusion to perfect self-absorption is traced.

1. Jiva Samasa-Soul-classes. From the protoplasm of the germ-cell to a full-blown human being, there is an infinite number of mundane souls or living beings in the universe. The protoplasm so far as is known at present, has no ears to hear, no eyes to see, no nose to smell, no tongue to taste ; it has only the sense of touch. The human being has all the five senses fully developed and distinct, and a mind also which is also a sort of additional and higher sense (a quasi-sense), the organ of which sense is invisible to us. In Jainism, it is an organ which is made up of subtle matter called Manovargana, or mental matter. Its form is like a lotus with eight petals near the heart. Dr. Robert Bell has long held the theory that the solar plexus is the real centre of mental activity. Professor Troude and eminent war-surgeons dispute the brain as the seat of mental activity. In war time operations, brains were removed without impairing the mental faculties. (The Leader, November 12, 1920, page 7, Col. 3).
Thus we can divide mundane souls into 6 classes :1 With the sense of touch only
fine. , & taste
gross. >> >> >> & smell
& sight ... "
& hearing ,
,, ,, ,, & mind , Fine-one sensed souls cannot be known by our senses. They can penetrate all matter. They are everywhere in the universe. They are not obstructed by, and they do not obstruct others. They die their own death.
Some of the above 7 kinds are born with the capacity to develop, others die before acquiring the capacity to develop. Each one of the 7 may therefore be developable or non-developable. Thus there may be said to be 14 soul-classes in all.
Here another distinction may be considered. Some mundane souls when attacked or in fear of something or some-one, can voluntarily change their place in space. A man attacked with a sword or by a lion can run away from the lion or his assailant. So a dog, cat, pigeon, butterfly, maggot, or the finest animalculce which we can see, runs away from the vicinity of danger and death. It is merely a paraphrase of the universal instinct of self-preservation.
But it is evident that a blade of grass, a huge oak, or banyan or a stone growing in a quarry cannot run away before the scythe, axe, or spade which threatens to put an end to its life. This capa

city to be able to take one's body from one place to another divides souls in the universe into Immobiles, like stones in quarry, vegetables, trees, etc., and mobiles like men, animals, birds, etc.
Observation will show that all one-sensed souls are immobile, incapable of voluntary change of place; and that all the other souls are mobile, who can at will run away from danger or death.
The classes are said to be 14 in Gatha 72 : 57 ir Gatha 73: 98 in Gatha 79 and 80 ; and 570 in Gatha 78. But we can classify them into 406 soul-classes, also, as below:

The following points as to the soul-Classes may be explained for the reader who is not familiar with the technicalities of Jainism.
NIGODA (VEGETABLE) KINGDOM. Sadharana, or Common, or Group-Souled Vegetables.
The Universe is 14 Rajus high, 7 Rajus at the base, with a thickness which at the base is 7 Rajus, then gradually decreases to one Raju at a height of 7 Rajus, i.e. at the Middle of the Universe, where the Middle World, i.e. the region of the human and subhuman beings, is situated. Then it gradually grows to a thickness of 5 Rajus at the point where the sixth Heaven ends, and which marks the Middle of the Upper World, or the region of Heavenly beings; finally it gradually decreases to a thickness of one Raju at the top of the Universe, i.e., 14 Rajus high above the base, 7 Rajus high above the Middle World, and 3) Rajus high above the sixth Heaven. It is here, that the Siddha Kshetra, or the Region of the eternally liberated Souls is situated. This is at the top of the Universe. (See Map at the end of this Introduction).
"Nigoda" beings are of two kinds, fine and gross. Fine Nigoda Living beings exist everywhere in the Universe, from the nethermost hell to the highest region of the eternally liberated souls. They are one-sensed, both developable and undevelopable, take birth and die 18 times in the short interval of time taken by one pulse-beat of an average human being. Of course, being souls, they have knowledge, but this knowledge, preceded by its conation, is limited to the sense of touch. These Nigoda souls are neither earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, nor air-bodied. They belong to the vegetable sub-classes of the Immobile class of souls : They have one body, occupied by many souls which are born, which live, and which die together.
These group-souls are of two kinds :
(1) Those who have never left Nigoda. These are called Nitya Nigoda, ever-one-body-many-souled.
(2) Those who left Nigoda and became embodied in higher forms of soul-classes, but have come down to Nigoda once more. These are called Itara Nigoda, or Chaturgati Nigoda. One-body many-souled.
These two are also called Sadharana, or "Common" or GroupSoul-classes of vegetables.
Pratyeka or Individual-Souled Vegetables. Other vegetables have one body and one soul only. They are called individual-souled or Individual(Pratyeka)vegetables. These are always gross, and never fine. But these again may or may not have parasites or hosts. Thus there are 2 kinds :
(1) Sapratishthita, or Host-one-souled vegetables. (2) Apratishthita, or Non-host-one-souled vegetables.

Each one of these two, being either a Trunk, Creeper, Plant, Tree, or Root, there are 10 classes of these individual-souled-vegetables, so-called in contrast to common or group-souled vegetables. Bhoga-Bhumi (Enjoyment Region).
The Jaina conception of the Middle World is that it is entirely confined to the one Raju square of the layer of the Mobile Channel (Trasa Nadi), at a height of 7 Rajus from the base of the Universe.
This Middle World consists of concentric rings of successive Continents and Oceans. Each succeeding ring has a width double of the ring-width of its predecessor. In the centre of the Middle World there is the first Continent Jambudvipa, of a diameter of one lac (1,00,000) Yojanas. It has in its centre the Sumeru mountain, which has a height of 1,00,040 Yojanas, 40 Yojanas of which form the top, and 1,000 Yojanas of which are embedded in the earth as the sub terranean foundation of the Mountain, and which has a circular base of the diameter of 10,000 Yojanas.
The Ocean, Lavana, next to Jambudvipa and encircling it all round is a ring with a width of 2 lac Yojanas. The next Dhatu ki Khanda, is a continent, a ring with a width of 4 lac Yojanas. The next Kalodadhi is the Second Ocean with a ring-width of 8 lac Yojanas. The next Pushkaravara Dvipa, is the third Continent with a ring-width or 16 lac Yojanas. And so on, till through innumerable Continents and Oceans we reach the last pair of rings, the the Svyambhu Ramana Ocean. This is the last ring of water holding our Middle World in its embrace.
It is to be noted that the third Continent Pushkara-Vara-Dvipa has a circular mountain bisecting it equally throughout the width of its ring. This mountain is called Manushottara, Cis-human, as there are no human beings beyond its limits nor can any human beings go beyond its limits. Thus the human regions are a circle of 45 lacs of Yojanas, and comprise the first two oceans and the first two and a half Continents.
It is noticeable that in Jainism there are 5 regions, each with a diameter of 45 lacs of Yojnas.
(1) The above human region is called the 2 Dvipas.
(2) As Nirvana is attained only from the human regions, the Siddha Kshetra at the top of the Universe also is a region with a diameter of 45 lac Yojanas.
(3) So is Siddha Shila, the earth below the Siddha Kshetra. (4) The first Indraka-Vimana or central celestial Car or residence, just one hair's breadth above the apex of Sumeru.

VI.
(5) The first Indraka Bila or Central hellish hole or resid.
ence of the denizens of hell in the first layer of hell, one
lac Yojanas below our earth. It is also interesting to note that there are 3 regions with a diameter of 1 lac Yojanas, and 2 regions with a height and thickness of the same extent respectively,
(1) Jambudvipa, the first Continent in the centre of the
middle World. (2) The last Indraka Vimana or central celestial Car or
residence in Sarvartha Siddhi in the last or 3rd layer of
the Upper World. (3) The last Indraka Bila, or Central hellish hole, or residence
of the denizens of hell in the last or 49th layer of hell in
the seventh earth in the Lower World. (4) The height of Mount Sumeru minus its top of 40 Yojanas. (5) The thickness of the first Earth from its crust at the
Middle World down to the end of the second part ; Panka Bhaga, i. e., just before the beginning of the first layer
of the first hell is also 1 lac Yojanas. Now the Central or first Continent, Jambu Dvipa, has a diameter of one lac Yojanas. This is divided into 7 Countries (Kshetra) each separated from the other by a mountain (Kulachala). Thus we have 7 countries and 6 mountains. The first is a Country; the second, a mountain and so on. Each succeeding division has double the width of its predecessor, till we reach Videha, the central region round Sumeru, from where the width begins to be half of its predecessor. Thus arithmetically the divisions are 1,2,4,8,16,32,64, 32,16,8,4,2,1, a total of 190 units. The countries in the extreme north and south being each of one unit have a width of one lac Yojanas divided by 190 i.e. 526. great Yojanas.
The second, third and fourth Countries have respectively 4, 16, and 64, units of width; as also the corresponding countries in the North, counting North to South, i,e, in each case from Lavana Ocean to Mount Sumeru.
In these 3 pairs of Countries there are the three Bhog Bhumis or Enjoyment-Lands, being the Lowest (Jaghanya), Middle (Madhyama), and the Highest (Utama) Bhoga-Bhumis, respectively.
In Videha, however, the Eastern and Western Countries, beyond the Eastern and Western Limits of the Bhadra Shala forest, are Karma Bhumi. The rest alone, i.e. the region immediately round Sumeru is the Highest Bhoga Bhumi. The region in the North

is called Uttara Kuru, that in the South Deva Kuru, Bhoga Bhumi.
In 32 countries of Videha, and in the rest of the Continent there is Karma Bhumi or Work-Region, where people have to depend on agriculture etc. for their living. In Enjoyment Region, they have no work to do, they get all that they want from Kalpa Vrikshas, wishing-trees, never have disease or accidents, and live the full span of their lives. The least happiness of a man in Bhoga Bhumi is infinite times the happiness of a Chakravarti.
It is very significant that the islanders of Java have a word in their language denoting an Enjoyment-Land. Is it that the Jaina missionaries and colonists penetrated into these islands, centuries and centuries ago, and left the tradition of their Bhoga-Bhumi there? Kubhoga-Bhumi (Distorted or Improper
Enjoyment-Region). In the Lavana Ocean, round Jambudvipa, and in Kalodadhi round Dhatu ki Khanda, there are 96 islands; 48 in each, 24 on each shore of the Ocean. They are inhabited by ill formed persons (kumanushya) with disproportionate (hundaka) bodies. All of them have an age of one Palya. These people also do not have any agriculture etc. and live, some on mud and some on fruits. They have no Wishing-trees. As they have no arts of agriculture etc., they are called people of Bhoga Bhumi, but as their life is low and savage-like and their forms improper and distorted, the land is called Ku-Bhoga Bhumi or wrong, distorted or improper Enjoyment-Land.
Paryapti (Developableness). The Chapter on Paryapti (Developableness) in Jainism is interesting, but not free from intricacy. It is dealt with in Jiva Kanda Chapter III Gathas 118-128; and is followed by an account of prana (Vitality) in Chapter IV (Gathas) 129-133. Biologists and Zoologists alone can say if it is capable of being subjected to experiments. But the briefest Jaina account is this. The newly born soul is incomplete, but has the capacity to become complete, in assimilation, body, senses, respiration, speech, and mind. The comple: tion of the capacity to develop these 6 assimilation etc., makes the 6 Paryaptis. When a soul goes from one condition of existen another, it assimilates the molecules of aharaka matter, and also of speech matter in the case of more than one-sensed, and of mindmatter in the case of rational beings. The aharaka molecules form the physical body of human and sub-human beings, the fluid (Vaik

riyaka, transformable) body of celestial and hellish beings, and the assimilative body in case of saints. These molecules must be reduced to a primary solid and liquid form. The completion of the capacity to do it is the Assimilative (Aharaka) Development. The solid portions develop into bone etc., hard substances, and the liquid into blood, bile etc. the fluid substances of the body. The completion of the capacity to do it, is the body (Sharira) Development. The molecular matter assimilated by the soul is further formed into senseorgans, the completion of the capacity to do it is the sense (Indriya) Development. The wear and tear of the body is made up by ceaseless Respiration. The completion of the capacity for respiration is the Ana-pana-Development. The completion of the capacity to form speech-molecules and mind-molecules into speech and mind, is respectively the speech and mind Development.
The beginning of the acquiring of 4, 5 or 6 capacities is simultaneous; but their completion is in the order in which they are named above. And from the first kind each successive development takes more time to complete itself than its predecessor. But each one individually, and all the 6 collectively never take more than one (Antara muhurta, the minimum of which is one wink (Avali) and one instant (Samaya), and maximum is 48 minutes minus one instant.
But a completely undevelopable (Labdhi-aparyaptaka) soul does not complete its capacities to develop, and dies within one antar-muhurta, which is one eighteenth of one pulse-beat.
The Nuclei (Yonis).
The Yoni is the womb or other physical centre or nucleus where the incarnating soul find its lodgment at conception. According to Jainism, such a nucleus may be cold, hot, covered or open, living or non-living, or a combination of these 3 pairs. Thus primarily yonis are of 9 kinds.
But with their classes and sub-classes they are 84 lacs. The 84 lacs of nuclei for birth of souls are as follows:One-Sensed beings:
Earth-bodied
Water-bodied
Fire-bodied
Air-bodied
Vegetables
Non-one-souled.

Ever-one-body-many-souled Other-one-body-many-souled

Total ... 84,00,000 II.Margana (Soul-Quest). In what different ways we search for a mundane soul? We can do so in no less than 14 different ways.
1. Four conditions of Existence (Gati).
We may see whether it is a human, or a sub-human soul on earth; or it is a non-human soul above or under the earth. These latter are the celestial and hellish beings. All ancient systems of thought posited their existence. We cannot see them today. But there is nothing inherently impossible in the conception of these forms of living beings, who live, think, and feel and can change their bodies at will, as described by Milton in his "Paradise Lost." This Quest may be called Condition of Existence (Gati).
2.-Five Senses (Indriya). The 5 senses give us another kind of Quest, called the SenseQuest.
3.-Six Embodiments (Kaya). The different kinds of embodiments of immobile and mobile souls furnish another kind of Quest. It is open to observation that the body of a vegetable and the body of a man are radically different. Ultimately as matter, they may be, and are the same. But their difference is equally marked. Their constitution and composition are different. Their Chemical characteristics vary. They occupy obviously different places in the whole range of living beings. It is on this basis that people are split up into vegetarians and non-Vegetarians. Vegetarians give up taking lives higher than non-vegetables, because animals are more evolved and their bodies approximate our own bodies more than the bodies of vegetables do.

Non-injury (Ahimsa).
I may be allowed to digress here. Live and let live is as simple a motto of life as it is Profound. No one has a right to destroy any life. Every one has a right to live.
Now the curious thing is that Life thrives on life. No living being can continue its life without another life being destroyed. How to reconcile these two facts: the duty of not-taking another's life and the right of preserving one's own, which necessitates destruction of other life? The reconciliation can be effected by interpreting these two sister precepts in a possible practical way, and not in an impossible Antinomian fashion.
"The ideal practice of non-injury is possible only to the soul in its perfect condition, i. e. when it has freed itself from the last particle of matter (Karma Varganas). On this side of that happy state, do whatever we will, some life must be transformed into our life in order to sustain it. Therefore what is meant and enjoined is simply this, "Do not destroy life, unless it is absolutely necessary for the maintenance of a higher kind of life." The purer souls will, of course, not like to sanction even this. But as formulated above, the rule does not sanction hurting or injury: it limits it to the lowest possible minimum. As a supplementary rule we have: "And then begin with the least evolved kind of life, for example, with the sthavars (immobiles)." (See Outlines of Jainism p. 71).
Destruction of any one or more of the 10 vitalities is injury. The extent of injury varies with the number of vitalities injured Immobiles possess four, the least number of vitalities. Mobiles have from 6 to 10 vitalities.
In the soul-classes above we found souls to be mobile or immobile. The immobiles are one-sensed beings and have for their bodies vegetables, air, fire, water or earth. Science every day is making progress in discovering these tiny and ultra-microscopic fellowbeings of ours. Plants are credited with conscious life now. Much that was considered inorganic is found in the light of greater knowledge to be organic. Air and fire, water and earth, are the bodies of innumerable living beings. From this point of view we can search a soul in 6 kinds of embodiment; earth, water, fire, air, vegetable and mobile.
4.- Fifteen Vibratory Activities (Yoga).
4. All activity of the body, speech, and mind is the cause of the inner modifications or vibrations of life or our vital consciousness. Thus our mundane life is continued. An angry thought, a noble

impulse, the passion of patriotism, and infinity of movements of body, speech and mind produce almost visible changes in matter. There is a constant circulation, action, and reaction between these outward acts and the inner consciousness-vibrations, of which the external vibrations are the cause.
Our speech, or thoughts may be true or false, a mixture of both or neither. This gives us eight kinds. Our body has several inter-penetrating sheaths of the outer body, electric and the karmic body. Their activity can be distinguished in no less than 7 ways. Thus the Vibration-Quest gives us 15 main kinds (for details see Gatha 216 et seq.
5.-Three sex-inclinations. (Veda). Every soul has the instinct of propagation. Life reproduces itself. This is due to sex-impulse. This takes three wel forms, male, female, or common. We can search soul in these three sex distinctions.
6.-The 25 Passions. (Kashaya). As soon as we take up any manifestation of the consciousness, volition of a soul, we can easily trace it to some passion or other in the consciousness. If we observe and analyse many of these manifestations, we find that they are due to the four passions of Anger, Pride, Deceit, and Greed, or their combinations. Again it is noticeable that there are innumerable degrees of each one of these passions. Take Anger. It may be so intense as to blind one and to last a long, long time. It may possess one in an extreme and erroneous form. It may only mean a loss of all restraint. It may prevent only partial restraint. Or it may be a transient feeling, which may disturb the perfect equanimity of the soul for a moment. From these four broad degrees, we may say the four passions to be of 16 kinds. Other minor passions are also noticeable (e. g.) laughter (hasya), indulgence (rati), ennui (arati), sorrow (shoka), fear (bhaya), disgust (jugupsa) and the masculine, feminine and common sex inclinations. This Quest may be called the Passion-Quest.
7.-Eight Quests of Knowledge (Jnana). Knowledge has been considered above in its five right kinds of sensitive, scriptural, visual, mental, and perfect ; and three wrong kinds of sensitive, scriptural and visual. These 8 kinds give the 8 Quests of Knowledge.
8.Six controls (Sanyama). Some souls have no control at all. Others have some sort of part control, part non-control. Some have more control than

55
others. They have equanimity; or have recovered it after losing it; or have a control which implies pure and absolute non-injury to other souls; they may be all but passionless; or they may be entirely ideal and passionless. So Shakespeare says : - "Give me that man
That is not passion's slave and I will wear him. In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart."
(Hamlet. Act IV Sc. 2.) The above 6 degrees of control give us the Quest of souls with regard to their control.
9. Four conation-quests (Darshana.) The four kinds of co-nation, ocular, non-ocular, visual, and perfect given before form the Conation-Quest.
10.-Six-Thought-Paints (Leshya). Every-thing which is matter, or mixed up with matter has some kind or other of touch, taste, smell and colour. Our mind and its activity are no exception. They are material and have colour, which they change with every change of their thought activity. A black-hearted man; red with rage; pale with fear; green with jealousy ;-these are familiar phrases. Our thoughts and emotions have a very intimate connection with colours. We may be said to have thought-paints. There are innumerable intermediate characters of paints: but the primary ones are black, blue, grey, yellow, pink or red and white. These 6 form the Soul Quest as to Thought-paint. The Leshyas are the Soul's vibrations effected by mild and strong passions.
11.-Liberability (Bhavyatva). You may seek souls in two classes; those who are capable of Liberation and those who are not capable of Liberation. The capacity of Liberation is the basis of this Quest.
12,Six Beliefs (Samyaktva). No living being is without some kind of creed, set of beliefs. He may or may not realise or analyse them. He may or may not express them to himself or any one else; but there they are in his inner being always.
Matter deludes the belief and conduct of the soul. But when matter subsides or entirely falls off, we have flashes of right faith and righteous conduct. This right belief may be due to the subsidence or destruction or part-destruction part-subsidence of the matter which keeps it submerged and deluded.

Three stages of this right belief are noticeable. To begin with, there is its absence, i.e., there is wrong belief. Then you may acquire right belief but lose it and slip from it to wrong belief, the condition of your belief during downfall. Thirdly, the condition of mixed right and wrong belief.
The above 2 triads give us 6 classes. These may be called Subsidential, Destructive, Destructive-Subsidential, Wrong belief, downfall belief and mixed right wrong belief. Here right belief is the basis of the Quest.
13.- Mind-Quest (Sanjna). Souls have mind or not. They are Rational or Irrational. This is the Rationality Quest.
14.-Assimilation-Quest (Anara). Souls are in an incarnation, as celestial, human, sub-human, and hellish being; there they are assimilating particles of matter for their physical bodies every instant.
But in transmigration from one condition of existence to another there is no assimilation of matter of physical body. This distinction gives us the Assimilation Quest. That is, souls are :
(1) those who are assimilating matter of their birth bodies
(Aharaka Vargana); or (2) those who are not so assimilating it, i.e., in transmig
ration in the three instants of omniscient overflow in the 13th stage, and in the 14th stage.
III.-Spiritual Stages. If we mark the freedom of pure soul from the impurifying bondage of matter we notice 14 stages.
1. The soul has delusion. It has wrong belief. (Mithyatva).
2. It had Right Belief, but it is falling from that to Wrong Belief. This is the Downfall Stage. (Sasadana).
3. It is in a stage of Mixed Right and Wrong Belief. (Mishra).
4. It has Right Belief; but does not act upon it; does not resolve or vow to follow it in actual life. It is Vowless Right Belief. (Avirata Samyaktva).
5. It may follow it by partial vows. We may call it the partial Vow-stage. (Desha-Vrata):
6. It may be with all possible vows, but may keep them imperfectly. Owing to negligence or illness (Pramada). Call it the partial Vow-stage. Pramatta-vrata).
7. If it has all Vows and keeps them perfectly, we have the Perfect Vow-stage. (Apramatta virata),






Page #68:
---------------------------

======================
| Romanization (original) |
======================




57
8. When all vows are kept perfectly, then new inner progress begins. The soul has a new inner thought-activity. Call it the New Thought-Activity (Apurva-Karana).
9. Further advance gives us the Advanced Thought-Activity stage (Nirvritti-Karana).
10. Then we near the Goal. Delusion is leaving us. When it has all but left us, call it the stage of Slightest Delusion (Sukshama-Samparaya).
11. If all Delusion has entirely subsided, we call the stage one of Subsided Delusion (Upashanta-moha).
12. If Delusion is destroyed, we are in the stage of Destroyed Delusion (Kshina moha).
13. Then the soul knows all, sees all. Still it has the body of its last incarnation and it vibrates as every body does at every instant. We call this the stage of Vibratory Omniscience (Sayogakevali).
14. When the body vibrations stop, the stage is of nonVibratory Omniscience. It is of a short duration, and is called Ayoga-Kevali. Then the soul is at the end of its mundane existence and becomes liberated from all Karmic matter for ever; and rushes upward to enjoy its own eternal, supra-sensual, undisturbable, Infinite Bliss along with Infinite Knowledge, Conation, Perfect Right Belief, and Power. It is Siddha. It is itself. The goal is reached. The ideal is realised. It is the acme of Fineness. It has no high or low class, because all pure souls are the same. It is interpenetrable with them. There is no struggle for existence; because there is pure and full existence for all. It dropped its last body for ever and thus has a size slightly less than that. It has reached the end of the Universe and is steady there. Its modifications are its own perpetual continuous self-modifications.
In the 14 stages it is noticeable that our progress is from Wrong-Belief to Right-Belief, then to Vows, then to perfectly careful Vows, then to Passionlessness and then to a cessation of the Vibratory Activity of Body, Speech, and Mind, which induces the inflow of matter into the soul. In other words, we are beset by 5 kinds of innate evils or imperfections. These are Wrong-belief, Vowlessness, Carelessness, Passion and Vibratory Activity. We shed Wrong-belief at the end of the first. Vowlessness at the end of the fourth, Carelessness at the end of the 6th and Passions at the end of the tenth, and Vibratory Activity at the end of the thirteenth stage.

1. Bowing to the Liberated, Pure, Spotless Moon, (Lord) Nemi, Supreme among Jinendras (Conquerors), I shall speak of the (part) descriptive of the Soul, in which sparkle the ornaments of jewels of qualities.
Commentary.
Liberated (Siddham)-(Siddha) literally means that which is accomplished. Here the acquisition of self-realisation was the object, accomplished by Lord Nemi.
Pure (Shuddham)-(Shuddha) following? siddha," the linguistic beauty of Alliteration is obvious.-" Pure" here means free from the four destructive (Ghatiya) Karmas.
Spotless Moon (Chandramakalamkam).-Figure of Oxymoron. Moon is known for spots; this is a defect in her otherwise perfect beauty. Lord Nemi is perfect. Therefore he is a spotless moon.

Note.-Nemi Chandra is the name of the author also. But some take it to be used as the name of Lord Nemi also, who is generally adored under the name of Neminatha, as the 22nd Tirthamkara of the Jainas.

Qualities (Guna).-This indicates the three jewels : right beliet, right knowledge, and right conduct, which jointly characterise a Liberated Soul.
Jewels (Ratna).- The above three Jewels (ratna-traya) are meant.
Descriptive (Prarupanam) - The part describing the soul, i.e., (Jiva Kanda) the name of the book.
(Gunaratna bhusanodayam).-In which treatise appear the brilliant three Jewels and infinite other attributes of a Perfect Soul.
Nemi.- Lord Nemi, the 22nd Tirthamkara is adored in this (Gatha) because the temple named (Mahaputa) (lit. very pure) at Sravanabelgola (also called Gommata Svami), contains the image of Lord Nemi. This Mahaputa was built by Raja Chamunda Raya, Minister of Maharaja Raja-Malla Deva, of the Ganga dynasty. RajaMalla was a pupil of the Saint Simha Nandi,
In a book there are 6 parts.
Invocation (Mangala); Occasion of writing it (Nimitta); Object (Hetu); Extent, number of (Gathas), etc.,(Parimana); name of book (nam a); and Author (Karta).
In this book, Gatha 1 is the invocation to Lord Nemi. The occasion was the question put to the author Sri Nemi Chandra by Chamunda-Raya. The question was: How does the body-making (Nama) Karma exist in fine (sukshma) non-developable (aparyapta,) earth-bodied souls, etc. ? The object is to propagate the tradition of Truth from master to pupil. The number of Gathas in Jiva Kanda is 735. The name is Jiva Kanda. The author is the Saint, Nemi Chandra Siddhanta Chakravarti.
Gommata Sara is also called (Pancha Sangraha), a collection of five topics :
1. That which is bound, i.e., the Soul (Bandhaka); 2. That which is bound to the soul (Badhyamana); 3. That which binds (Bandha Svami);
4. The varieties of bondage (Bandha Bheda); - 5. The cause of bondage (Bandha Hetu).
The first of these, namely, (Bandhaka) i. e., the mundane soul forms the subject-matter of Jiva Kanda (Jivasya Praru panam, description of the soul.) The other four form the subject-matter of Karma Kanda.

GOMMATASARA.
This Gommatasara is based on the Great Book Dhavala written by the saint Bhutabali. Dhavala is a constituent of the great trilogy Dhavala, Jaya Dhavala, Maha - Dhavala. All these three were composed by the saints Bhutabali and Pushpadanta, who were the pupils of Dharasenacharya.

Detail ( Vistara) and exposition (Adesha) (are) the other names for the soul-quest (Margana). The (14) soul-quests (are) due to (the operation of) their (corresponding) Karmas.

Commentary.
The spiritual stages are called summary or propositional, because they are the general names of the 14 stages, to some one or other of which all mundane souls must belong at a given moment

of time. Evidently this is merely a brief classification. The 14 soul-quests with their 74 or 95 sub-divisions give the details about each one of these infinite souls classified into 14 spiritual stages ; therefore, the soul-guests are also called detail or exposition of the mundane souls.

(Thus really there are only two chapters, 14 Spiritual Stages and 14 Soul-Quests,) but by (further) division 20 chapters have been laid down.

GOMMATASARA.
The age (Ayuh) vitality is included in the condition of existence soul-quest, because they always co-exist. They begin together and end together. The age Karma determines the duration of the particular condition of existence in which the mundane soul is found; and the duration of the condition of existence is exactly the length of time that the age Karma lasts. Thus evidently the age vitality is the vitality which is co-existent with, and therefore. included in, the condition of existence.
The 14 soul-classes are evidently included in the 5 senses, and 6 embodiment soul-quests. The gross and fine immobile (Sukshma and Vadara Sthavara) souls are included in one sensed beings. The rational (Sanjni) and irrational (Asanjni) mobile (Trasa) souls are included in the five-sensed beings.
The 6 kinds of capacity to develope (Paryapti) are included in the 5 senses and 6 embodiment soul-quests, because the development has reference to one or more of the 5 senses and 6 embodiments.
The three vitalities, respiration, speech-power, and mind-power are respectively the effect of the last three of the 6 capacities to develope. The capacities being included in the sense and embodiment soul-quests, the vitalities are also included in the same. The body-power vitality is the cause of vibratory activities, (Yoga) of 7 embodiments (Kaya); therefore this vitality is included in the embodiment-vibratory-activity soul-quest.
Coition animate-feeling is dependent upon sexes, therefore it is included in the sex soul-quest.
Fear animate-feeling is included in the passions of anger and pride as, on ultimate analysis, these two passions, in some form or other, are involved in it. Similarly hunger animate feeling is included in the passions of deceit and greed. Worldly attachment animate-feeling is evidently included in the passion of greed.
The 5 sense-vitalities and definite (knowledge) conscious attentiveness are included in their effects, (the 8 kinds of knowledge,) in the knowledge soul-quest; similarly indefinite conscious attentiveness is included in the conation soul-quest.

8. The thought activities caused by the operation, etc. (of Karmas by which souls are distinguished (are) spiritual stages, (as) has been described by the All seeing.
Commentary. Operation, etc., (Udayadi). - 5 kinds of thought-activities are recognised in Jainism.
I.-Subsidential (Aupashamika). This arises by the subsidence (Upashama) of the deluding (Mohaniya) Karmic matter. It is of 2 kinds.
II.Destructive (Kshayika). It arises from the destruction of 4 obstructive (Ghatiya) Karmas. It is of 9 kinds.
III.- Destructive-subsidential (Kshyayopashamic). It arises by partial destruction, partial subsidence, and partial operation of the destructive Karmas. It is of 18 kinds.
IV.- Operative (Audayika). It arises by the operation of the Karmas. It is of 21 kinds.
V. - Natural (Parinamika). This activity consists of the self-modification of the soul. It is of 3 kinds.
Thus the total number of kinds of thought-activity is 53. (Vide Tattvartha Sutra Chapter II, Sutras 1 to 6).
The possession of a different set of thought-activities distinguishes one class of souls from another. The different classes are called the different spiritual stages or (Gunasthana).

10. Subsided-delusion (Upashanta Moha), Delusionless (Kshina Moha), Vibrating omniscient Conqueror (Sayoga Kevali Jina), and Non-vibrating omniscient (Ayoga Kevali): these should be known to be the 14 spiritual stages (Jiva Samasa-Gunasthana) one after another. After the last, the souls become liberated (Siddha).
Commentary. The first four are vowless (Avirta); and the fifth, and all the following are vowful (Virata) stages. The 13th and all that precede it are with vibratory activity (Sayogi). The fourth and the following are the stages of the Conqueror (Jina), because the soul in the 4th stage has conquered the right-belief-deluding Karma (Darshana Mohaniya) i. e., the Karma which deludes the soul from right belief.
In reality the different thought-activities are innumerable. But as there are some prominent ones, commonly found in mundane souls, we are enabled to classify them into 14 stages.

11. In delusion (Mithyatva-Gunasthana) there is certainly the thought-activity due to the operation of Karmas (Audayika Bhava), and in the second (Downfall, Sasadana), natural (Parinamika) thought-activity. In the mixed (Mishra), the destructive subsidential-thought activity, (and) in the vowless-right-belief (Avirata Samyaktva) all the three i. e., subsidential, destructive and destructive-subsidential, (Aupashamika, Kshayika and Kshayopashamika).

12. These thought-activities are certainly necessari. ly said to be from the view-point of the right-belief-delud. ing Karma (Darshana-Moha) because up to the end of vowless (Avirata) stage (i. e., in the first 4 spiritual stages), (there) is no right conduct (Charitra).
Commentary. From this it is obvious that there can be no right conduct without first acquiring right belief.

In the Partial, Imperfect, and the other (i. e., Perfect) vow, (Desha-virata, Pramatta-Virata and Apramatta-Virata) (there is) the destructive-subsidential thought-activity. This certainly is said to be from the view-point of right-conduct-deluding-Karma (Charitra Mohaniya). The same for higher stages.

14. Beyond this (i. e., the 7th stage), in the (4) subsidential stages, (i. e., the Sth, 9th, 10th and 11th) the thought-activity (is) subsidential, and in the (4) destructive stages (i. e., 8th, 9th, 10th and 12th), and up to end of the non-vibrating omniscient stage, (i. e., in the 13th and 14th), and in the liberated soul (there is) necessarily the - destructive" thought-activity.
Commentary. The 7th stage of perfect vows (Apramatta-Virata) is of two kinds; ordinary perfect vows. (Svas-thana-Appramatta), in which the soul wavers to and fro between the perfect and the imperfect vow stages, i. e., constantly comes down to the 6th and then goes back to the 7th stage; or extraordinary perfect vow (Satishaya Appramatta) in which the soul can go beyond the 7th stage. This the soul can do along two ladders, subsidential ladder (Upashama Shreni) or destructive ladder (Kshayika Shreni). The ascent along the subsidential ladder, as the name implies, is when the thoughtactivity is due to the subsidence of the matter of the right-conduct-deluding Karma. The ascent from the extraordinary perfect vow, (Satishaya Apramatta), 7th stage is as follows:-First to the stage of New-thought-activity (Apurva Karana) 8th stage; then to-Advanced-thought-activity (Anivritti Karana), the 9th stage ; then Slightest-delusion (Sukshma Samparaya), the 10th stage ; and then to Subsided-delusion (Upashanta Moha), the 11th stage. Along the subsidential ladder the soul cannot advance further: The duration of the soul's stay in this stage is one antarmuhurta, i.e., from one avali plus one Samaya up-to 48 minutes minus one Samaya. After this very short sojourn in the 11th stage, the soul must gradually come down to any of the lower stages.
Ascent along the destructive ladder, as the name implies, is when the thought-activity is due to destruction of the matter of the right-conduct-deluding Karma. In this ladder, the ascent from the 7th extraordinary stage is as follows:New-thought-aetivity,

the 8th; Advanced-thought-activity, the 9th; Slightest-delusion, the 10th; and Delusionless, (Kshina-Moha) the 12th. Note that in this ascent, the soul does not touch the 11th stage, which is the peculiar and direct effect of the subsidential-thought-activity; but goes from the 10th direct to the 12th stage, delusionless. This is the effect of destroying the deluding Karma which can no more rise to delude the soul. Therefore, evidently, there can be no fall from this stage: once arrived here. the soul must rise to the 13 then having all but exhausted the age Karma, (Ayuh), hasten through the 14th stage in which it drops off all vestiges of matterin the form of the 4 non-destructive Karmas, and attains final and everlasting liberation, micchodyenn micchttmsdhnnN tu tccatthaannN  /

15. (The delusion stage) or wrong. belief thoughtactivity (Mithyatva) is caused by the operation of the wrong-belief, (Mithyatva) sub-class of the right-belief-deluding Karma. It consists in not having belief in things as they are (Tattvartha) (i. e., the seven Principles, Tattvas of Jainism). Wrong-belief is of 5 kinds :
(1) One-sided belief (Ekanta). (2) Perverse belief (Viparita). (3) Veneration (of false creeds-Vinaya). (4) Doubtful belief (Samshaya).
(5) Indiscriminate belief (Ajnana). eyNt buddhdrsii vivriio bhm taavso vinno /  iNdo viy sNsiyo mkddio cev annnnaannii  // 16 //  ekaanto buddhdrshii vipriito brhm taapso vinyH /  indropi c sNshyito mskrii caivaajnyaanii  //  16  //

Tapasa, and doubtful belief (Samshaya) as in the followers of Indra, (etc.), also indiscriminate belief (Ajnana) as in the followers of Maskari (etc.)
Commentary. Clear, reasoned argument is at the basis of Jaina belief. Not only right belief is necessary, but it must be based on right reasoning. One of the most important characteristics of Jainism is its many points of view (Anekanta) All things can be looked at from different points of view. Different standpoints yield different results, which sometimes seem to contradict each other. The value and the necessity of the many-sided doctrine are thus evident.
In all the five examples given above, there is apparent some sort of religious belief, self-denial, an admirable determination and devotion, but on a deeper consideration all the five turn out to be merely varieties of error of one kind or another. Thus, Buddhism believes that every thing is transient ; this is perfectly true so far as the ever-present modifications of substances are concerned. but these modifications must depend upon something in which they are going on. That some thing remains one throughout its modi. fications. Truth tells us that every substance is characterised by a number of attributes and modifications. Its modifications are always changing, but its attributes, which make it the particular individual substance, last throughout all these changes. The substance is called Dravya, its attributes Guna, its modifications Paryava. The coming in of the view modification is Utpada ; the going out of the old one is Vyaya ; and the lasting sameness which always remains in the thing which is modified is called Dhrauvya. Buddhism also fixes its mind upon modifications. But it ignores the permanence of the substance upon which the modifications depend. This is what is meant by saying that Budhism is only a one-sided and
e a kind of wrong belief. The Vedas are the most ancient and most authoritative revealed sacred books of the Hindus. Also they are characterised by the great importance of Yajna, sacrifice of many kinds. Goats, sheep, horses, cows, even human beings, were brought to the sacrificial altar to gain merit and reward in this world and in the next. The great perversity and ignorance of this kind of belief is obvious. The first thing to realise is that there is a common or similar current of life in all living beings, and that any injury to the vitality of the lowest animal is as hurtful and painful to it as to the highest human

being. Then it would be conceded that it is the duty of every thinking spiritual being not to hurt anything that lives, and that it is the greatest sin to neglect this first precept of Life. How can then killing animals for sacrifice bring any good here or hereafter to the killer or the killed or indeed to any body else? No example could be a more patent illustration of perverse belief.
Much less justifiable and much more sinful and censurable, then, is the killing of animals for food or sport. Belief that such taking of life is right or excusable is certainly a perverse belief. The enormity and sinfulness of modern Wars is obvious.
True veneration is always the due of real and universal truth, and of those who have realised it themselves, and are willing and capable of helping others to realise it.
When this veneration is paid to a lesser doctrine or person, it is a sign that the belief which inspires it, is not right. When ignorant or superstitious people worship the goddess Mata, Sitla, to remove their small-pox or to give them children; or even educated or scientific people claim provisional or incomplete truth to be whole and eternal truth, and venerate it as such their veneration cannot be called right-belief, because it is directed towards a partially or wholly wrong matter.
When a man is not sure about the ultimate right or wrong of his belief, he is said to have wrong belief due to doubt. For example, like the saint Indra, who was in doubt whether a woman could or could not attain liberation.
People, who mortify the flesh to save the soul, venerate and follow the wrong. The flesh must be subordinated to the soul, but blind hurting of the flesh is not the true path to the liberation of the soul.
Right belief is belief in things as they really exist. It in volves a true knowledge of these things. Any indiscrimination or absence of knowledge, to whatever cause it may be due, prevents the belief from being complete and right. Then the Ajnana kind of wrong belief is said to arise.

belief (Mithyatva) the right belief being lost, the (stage) should be known by the name of Downfall (Sasana or Sasadana).
Commentary.
Subsidential right-belief is of 2 kinds (1) Prathamaupashama Samyaktva-the first subsidential-right-belief. It may arise (1) in a soul which has never had right-belief, by the subsidence of the four Error-feeding passions (4 Anantanubandhi Kashayas) and wrong-belief Mithyatva; or (2) in a soul which has had (but has lost) right-belief, by the subsidence of the above 5, and of the 2, mixed-right-and-wrong belief (Samiaktva Mithyatva) and right-belief-clouded-by-slight-wrong-belief (Samyaktva Prakriti Mithyatva) Karmas.
(2) Dvitiyopashama Samyaktva, the second subsidential rightbelief. It arises in a saint in the 7th spiritual stage of perfect vows, when the saint is preparing to pass on to the 8th stage of New-thought-activity along the ladder of subsidential advancement, having been already a right believer of the destructionsubsidential kind. He transforms the nature of the four error-feeding passions, into lesser passions, and causes the subsidence of the 3 sub-classes of right-belief-deluding Karmas, namely, Mithyatva, Samyaktva Mithyatva, and Samyaktva Prakriti Mithyatva. The right-belief of this saint is called the second subsidential rightbelief.
The matter of wrong belief Karma by being subjected to the thought-activity of the first subsidential right-belief is changed into the above 3 kinds. Wrong belief has the largest number of molecules. Mixed-right-and-wrong belief has a number of molecules innumerably less than it. And right-belief-clouded-by-slightwrong-belief innumerably less than those of mixed-right-andwrong-belief.
In (Gatha) 11, the thought-activity in this stage is said to be the natural (Parinaamika) thought-activity of the soul; this is so because the right belief which the soul had acquired in the 4th stage has left it, and it has not yet fallen back into the stage of wrong belief (Mithyatva). The minimum duration of the fall is one instant of time, and the maximum is 6 winks (Avali). During this downfall the soul has neither right belief nor wrong belief, therefore it is said to have its natural (Parinamika) thought-activity; because right-belief-deluding Karma (Mithyatva) has not yet begun to operate, but will do so after 6 winks at the most, i. e., when the

soul has fallen down to the first stage of delusion (Mithyatva).. Note, however, that the downfall itself is due to the operation of the error-feeding passion. From this point of view in the downfall (Sasadana) stage the soul is said to have operative thought-activity (Audayika Bhava). smmaamicchudyenn jttrsvvghaadikjjenn /  /  nny smm micchN pi y ssmisso hodi prinnaamo // 21 //  smygmithyaatvodyen c jaatyntrsrvghaatikaaryenn  /  nc smyktvN mithyaatvmpi c smmishro bhvti prinnaamH  // 21 //

Commentary. Jatyantara Sarvaghati.- There are 4 destructive (Ghatiya) Karmas ; Deluding (Mohaniya) Karma is one of them. It is of two kinds : right-belief-deluding (Darshana Mohaniya) and right-conduct-deluding (charitra-mohaniya). Right-belief-deluding Karma is of three kinds :
(1) Wrong belief (mithyatva). (2) Mixed-right-and-wrong belief (Mashra or Samyaktva
| Mithyatva). (3) Right-belief-slightly-clouded-by-wrong-belief (Samyaktva
Prakriti Mithyatva). All these three classes are of "destructive" Karmic matter; but there is a difference in their degrees. Mithyatva is all distructive (sarvaghati) of right belief. Mishra is slightly different from Mithyatva, because it does not effect a total destruction of right belief, as in it there is always present some right belief mixed with wrong belief.

The 3rd is still legs destructive. It is called partially des tructive (Deshaghati). In this, right belief is not destroyed, but only slightly clouded by wrong belief.

nor does the death-bed overflow (maranantika samudghata take place) in the mixed (Mishra stage).
Commentary.
19
One thing must always be remembered with regard to this and the preceding stage. They are both more or less transitory. The utility and necessity of the downfall (sasadana) stage is simply to mark or explain the thought-activity of the soul during the very short time which it takes in its downfall from right belief in the 4th to wrong belief in the 1st stage. The thought-activity in the mixed stage also is of very short duration, one (Antar-Muhurta), the minimum being a wink (Avali) and an instant, and the maximum being 48 minutes minus one instant. In the thoughtactivity in this stage the soul is both a wrong and right believer. The preservation of wrong belief makes it impossible that he should practise any vows. The vows are reserved for the 5th stage and onwards. They are a part of right conduct; and right conduct must always be preceded and accompanied by right knowledge and right belief.
Another noticeable thing is this. In the mixed stage, as also in the thought-activity due to subsidential-right-belief, there is no bondage of the matter of age-karma. The bondage of the age-karma, as also the death before reincarnation (the agekarma for an incarnation is bound to the soul in the immediately preceding birth, so that a man is born with an age-karma already binding his soul) must take place from the first or the fourth spiritual stage. According to Shri Nemi-Chandra-Acharya, the death must be from that very stage in which the age-karma is bound. But the commentary of Shri-Abhaya-Chandra page 49, (Gommatsara Jiva-Kanda, Calcutta Press) mentions another opinion that the death must be from the 1st or the 4th stage, but not necessarily from the one in which the age-karma was bound. In this stage there is no death-bed overflow of the soul; this is necessary, because there is no death in this stage.
It would be seen that there can be no bondage of age-karma in this stage, because at a man's death-bed, the same thoughtactivity must prevail by which the age-karma of its next incarnation was bound. And as there can be no death in this, there can be no bondage of age-karma in this stage.
Now why should a man not die in this stage?

Perhaps it is that the vitalities, which keep up the inevitable struggle between right and wrong belief, grow extremely weak

Samyaktva). It is wavering (chala), impure (Malina), non-steadfast (Agadha), but it (is) always a cause of the destruction of Karmas.

26. Subsidential-right-belief (Upashama Samyaktva) arises by subsidence of (all the) seven (kinds of Karmic matter, i. e. of the 3 sub-classes of right-belief-deluding Karma Darshana Moha, and the 4 error-feeding passions (Anantanubandhi kashaya). But by the destruction of these seven arises the destructive-right-belief, Kshayika (Samyaktva). And by the operation of the second (class, i, e., partial-vow-preventing or Apratyakhyana) passions this right belief is without control (Asamyata) or vowless.
Commentary. The 4th stage is called Avirata or Asamyata Samyaktva or vowless-right-belief. Vows cannot appear in it because there is operation of the partial-vow-preventing passions (Apratyakhyana varana kashaya). The right belief in this stage may be of three kinds. The latter kind is always preceded by the former :These three kinds of right belief are as follows :

GOMMATASARA.
1. Subsidential-right-belief (Upashama Samyaktva).-It is of two kinds, (i) first (Prathama) (ii) second (dvitiya). (See under Gathas 19-20 above). The duration of this is at the most one Antar muhurta. From this the soul falls down to the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd stage. This three-fold downfall has been described above in the preceding Gathas. If there is no downfall, then after the expiry of its duration, it changes into the second kind of right belief.
21
2. Destructive-subsidential-right-belief
(Kshayopashama-Sam
yaktva) in which there is the operation of right-belief-slightly clouded-by-wrong-belief, (Samyaktva-Prakriti-Mithyatva) the last of the 3 sub-classes of right-belief-deluding Karma, (Darshana Moha), and the other 2 sub-classes along with the 4 error-feeding passions are partially destroyed and partially in subsidence. The minimum duration of this destructive-subsidential right-belief is one AntarMuhurta; and the maximum is 66 Sagaras. This maximum is made up of 13 Sagaras in the 7th heaven, 22 in the 16th, and 31 Sagaras in the highest (Graiveyaka).
3. Destructive-right-belief (Kshayika Samyaktva).-It arises by the destruction of all the 3 sub-classes of right-belief-deludingkarma and the 4 error-feeding passions. This is the best and highest kind of right belief; once gained, it lasts for ever. The soul that acquires it, must-attain liberation at the latest in 33 Sagaras and 2 crore -Purvas, minus 8 years and one AntarMuhurta. This maximum is possible for a human being who is born in Videha Kshetra, (one of the seven divisions of Jambu Dweepa), and has the maximum age of one crore Purva. From there he can, after completing his age, attain Sarvartha Siddhi (the highest heaven) with an age of 33 Sagaras. He may thereafter be born again in Videha Kshetra with the maximum age of one crore Purva, after which he must attain liberation. As a human being can not attain destructive-right-belief before reaching the age of 8 years, and as the period for the attainment of destructive-right-belief is one antar-muhurta, we have to deduct 8 years and one antar-muhurta from 33 Sagaras and 2 crore Purvas, to fix the maximum duration of destructive-right-belief. This arises only at the feet of the Omniscient Kevali or the allscripture-knowing Shruta Kevali saints.
=
The destructive-right-belief is perfect. There is no matter to cloud or disturb it, but in the destructive-subsidential-right belief

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
there is the operation of that class of Karmic matter which gives rise to right-belief-slightly-clouded-by-wrong-belief. This slight clouding takes the form of the 3 defects -wavering (chala), defective or impure (mala), and non-steadfast (agadha).
By wavering; (chala) is meant that condition of right-belief in which its substance remains quite sound, but only the form is slightly disturbed, as the surface of the ocean is. disturbed by the waves ; an example of it, which is generally, given is that of a man who worships Shantinatha specially, rather than the other Tirthankaras for acquiring peace or Shanti.
By defective or impure (mala), is meant right-belief which has got the five following defects :
(1) Shanka Doubt, Scepticism. (2) Kanksha - Desire of sense pleasures. (3) Jugupsa- Disgust with a sick or deformed person. (4) Anyadrishti-Prashansa-Thinking admiringly of wrong
believers. (5) Anyadrishti Samstava-Praising wrong believers.
By non-steadfast (Agadha) is meant right-belief which is not quite fixed in the true nature of things ; for example, worshipping in one's own temple in preference to the temple built by others. It is something like a mirror attached to a pivot, to which it is not firmly fixed. It will show a perfect image but not steady. For a man who has steadfast right-belief knows that it makes not the slightest difference, whether you worship in your temple or in one built by your neighbour.
These 3 defects do not occur in subsidential-right-belief also. In this and in the destructive-right-belief, the vision is clear, and there is no room for doubt or defects. None of these 7 Karmas is operative to cloud the clearness of the vision. It is only in the destructive-subsidential-right-belief that the Samyaktva Prakriti Mithyatva is operative, and therefore these defects arise.*

Commentary. In this stage there is right belief, but conduct is not yet based on it. Even the vows of a layman are not adopted. He has not vowed to abstain from indulgence in the senses, or from hurting the vitalities of mobile and immobile living beings, although as a right believer he has his heart filled with 1. Compassion (Anukampa) 2. calmness (Prashama), (3) Fear of mundane exis

tence (Samvega), and (4) belief in the principle of truth (Astikya) and therefore he does not hurt any one without provocation. Control (Samyama), or vow (vrata) relates to the senses or the vitalities. It is respectively called sense-control (Indriya Samyama) and vitality-control (Prana-Samyama). In sense-control one's own senses are restrained, and in vitality-control one restrains oneself from doing any injury to the ten vitalities of himself or others. The man in this stage of vowless right-belief takes no vows for any of these two kinds of control.

30. Owing to the operation of the total-vow-preventing passions (Pratyakhyana-varana Kashaya which is a sub-division of the right-conduct-deluding Karma) the thought-activity which produces (perfect) control (Samyama) does not arise, but (there is) some control. Therefore the 5th (stage) is (called) the partial-vow (Deshavrata) stage.
Commentary. This partial-vow stage (Deshavrata) (has the destructive-subsidential thought-activity (Kshayopashama-Bhava), because in it there is partial destruction and partial subsidence of the Karmic matter of the passions which prevent total vow (Pratyakhyana-varana Kashaya) and there is the operation (Udaya) of that kind of Karmic matter which forms such passions as prevent the vows only partially. So that in this stage only partial vows can be observed.
that in the destruction-subsidence (Kshayopashama) of Karmas, the destruction of part of the Karmic matter means that though the Karmic matter in the ordinary course of things does rise on its maturity to bear fruit, yet instead of bearing fruit, it simply passes along and leaves the soul, free. By subsidence (Upashama) is meant the precipitation, or subsiding, of those Karmas which are in actual bondage with the soul but which do not operate at th time. This destruction is called non-operative destruction (Udayabhava-Lakshana-kshaya), and the subsidence is called existencesubsidence (Sattarupa Upashama).

31. (He) who vows against the killing of mobile ( trasa ) souls, and (is) vowless as to the killing of immobile (Sthavara) souls, and is entirely devoted to the Conqueror (Jina), is vowful and vowless (virata - avirata) at one and the same time.
25
Commentary.
This must be noted that this is a stage which is accompanied by right-belief. A right believer may be a vowless man. But he always carries compassion, etc., in his heart, therefore he never commits unprovoked or unnecessary sin, even if he has not vowed against its commission; so the soul in the fifth stage has not vowed not to hurt immobile souls, but naturally he would not hurt even immobile souls unnecessarily.

32. Because by the operation of perfect-right-conduct preventing passions (Sanjvalana Kashaya) and minor passions (Nokashaya) control is (effected), carelessness (Pramada ) productive of impurity also ( is caused); therefore it is really the stage careless or imperfect vow (Pramatta Virata ), ( the sixth spiritual stage).

Commentary.
The thought-activity here also is destructive-subsidential (Kshayopashama), i. e., there is destruction and subsidence of almost all the Karmic matter of the passions. Still there is the intense operation (Tibra - Udaya) of the little matter of perfect-conductpreventing and the minor passions, which has escaped [destruction and subsidence. Its effect is to partially prevent the observance of the perfect vows.

Hence the name of the stage: -imperfect vow (Pramatta Virata).
Sanjvalana Kashayas are four, being those kinds of anger, pride, deceit and greed which prevent the vows which constitute perfect right conduct; and the minor passions (Nokashaya) are mine :
Hasya-laughter, Rati-indulgence, Arati - Ennui, Shoka-sorrow, Bhaya-fear, Jugupsa- disgust, Stri-veda-feminine inclination, Purusha-veda masculine inclination, Napumsaka-veda-common inclination.
Pramada means carelessness in being attentive to the realisation of right-belief, right knowledge, and right conduct.

33. He who remains in evident (Vyakta) and nonevident (Avyakta) carelessness (Pramada), with all the (28 Root, Mula) qualities (Guna), and calm dispositions, (Shila) has full vows (Mahavrata) and is of variegated (i.e., imperfect) conduct, i. e., the observer of imperfect vow (Pramatta Samyata).
Commentary. Evident (Vyakta) oarelessness is evident to the saint himself, and to others who may observe him. Non-evident (Avyakta) carelessness is hidden, and is known only to those who possess direct knowledge (Pratyaksha Jnana).
28 Root-qualities (Mula-guna) these are the essential qualities in a saint, even of the lowest degree, viz: 1-Five Maha-vratas- the five great vows:
(1) Ahimsa-non-injury to any of the 10 vitalities. (2) (Satya)-truth in speech, thought and deed. (3) (Asteya)-to take nothing unless and except it is given. (4) (Brahma-charya)- chastity. (5) (ParigrahaTyaga)-renunciation of worldly attachment.

2. Five (samitis)- religious observances or carefulness about:(1) (irya) -walking, (2) Bhasa speech, (3) Eshana, taking only pure food, and that also when it is not specially prepared for the saint, (4) (adana-nikshepana)-handling and putting the things as water-bowl, peacock-brush, and scripture which saints may keep, (5) (Pratishthapana) - answering calls of nature.
3. Six daily duties (Avashyaka) (1) Samayika-practising equanimity, (2) Vandana obedience to perfect souls and High Saints and the Holy images, (3) (Stuti)-praising their qualities (4) Pratikramana- repentance for faults already attached to the soul, (5) Pratyakhyana-fore-thought and endeavour so that in future no faults may attach to the soul, (6) Kayotsarga-giving up attachment to the body and practising contemplation.
27
4-Self-restraint of five senses,
and seven other duties (1) not to bathe, (2) sleeping on the ground, (3) Nakedness, (4) pulling the hair out with one's own hands, (5) taking only little food once a day, (6) not to rub and cleanse the teeth, (7) taking food standing and only in hollow of the folded hands.
Variegated conduct (chitrala-acharana.)- every thought-activity has its corresponding thought-paint (Leshya). The pale mien of habitually studious people, and the dark red of persons in rage has been noticed in all countries and ages. A man with an unfixed conduct often changes his thought-paint or leshya. Sri Nemi chandracharya has used a very appropriate word, chequered or variegated to express this unfixity of conduct. This unfixity is due to carelessness (Pramada) as described in the text.
It must be noted that all the most obvious and usual duties of saintship are discharged in this stage; for example-teaching, and preaching the scriptures, and reading and writing the books, looking after the discipline of pupils, travelling abroad, and taking food.

The 4 censurable talks or gossips ( Vikathas ), each being com - bined with each one of the 4 passions, gives the number 4x4 - 16 of combinations of 2 elements each. Each of these 16 being combined with each one of the 5 senses make 16x5 = 80 combinations of 3 elements each. Each one of these 80 must have sleep and attach - ment, so that the number of the combinations of 5 elements each

Each one of the 4 passions can cover the gossips in turn, thus we get 16 combinations of two elements each. All these 16 combina - tions will have to be placed 5 times so that each one of them should be covered with each one of the 5 senses, thus yielding 80 com - binations of 3 elements each.

Commentary, _For example-what are the elements in combination No. 15. To find out the Vikatha element, divide 15 by 4, the remainder is 3, therefore the Vikatha is the 3rd i. e., the seditious gossip (Rashtri Katha). Adding one to the quotient 3, we get 4, to find out the passion divide 4 by 4, there is no remainder, that means the last passion, i. e., greed (Lobha) ; the quotient was one ; as there was no remainder, nothing to be added to it. Divide 1 by 5. the remainder is 1. the sense element is the first, i. e., touch (sparsha). Therefore the 15th combination is one of seditious gossip,

greed passion, sense of touch, sleep and attachment. (V. K. I i.e. the third Vikatha, gossip; the fourth Kashaya, passion; and the first Indriya, sense).
A concrete example of it may be something like this :
A man takes part in seditious talk and is prepared to commit sedition for money so that he may go and live with his wife in his village. Here the elements of seditious gossip, greed, and the object of touch are obvious. Sleep and attachment are the two elements common to all combinations of Pramada. They merely indicate that the soul who is affected by carelessness (Pramada) is a mundane soul. Sleep and attachment to some extent or other, are always present in all careless mundane souls, i. e., in all souls who are not in the seventh or higher spiritual stages. This example applies to the combinations under gathas 38 and 40. Under gathas 37 and 39 the process is exactly the reverse of it. We begin the senses and finish with the gossips.

42. Taking 1, multiply it by the number of the elements of the last class, substract from it the number of elements which follow in their class the element given. Do the same at all steps.
Commentary.
For example to find the number of combination, being given the elements seditious gossip, greed, and touch etc., i. e., 3rd gossip, 4th passion and 1st sense. Take 1, multiply it by 5 senses=5, substract from it 4 (i. e., the No. of senses which follow touch in their class) this gives 1. Multiply the remainder by 4 passions-4, substract from it nothing as no element follows greed in the passion class -4. Multiply 4 by 4 gossips-16; substract 1 as 1 gossip follows seditious gossip in the gossip class, the result is 15. Thus 15th is the number of this combination.

Note that the number of combinations and their elements are exactly the same in both the diagrams. It is also noticeable that the first and the last columns have the same total of figures and the same elements. The intermediate combinations also have the same elements but are not denoted by the same number, and are necessarily differently situated in the two diagrams.

In gatha 44, 32 is represented by the word (Raga) (M). The two letters (Ra) and (Ga) respectively represent 2 and 3; the reading is the reverse: This representation of numbers by letters is just like the Hebrew, Arabic and Persian, where for example, Alif (1)1, (Be) (-) 2, (Jima) (e) 3, etc.

Commentary. The stage of perfect vows is of two kinds, ordinary perfect vow (Svasthana apramatta) and extraordinary perfect vow (Satishaya apramatta).

46. He, whose combinations of carelessness are all suppressed, who is adorned with the chain of the (o great) vows, (28 root) qualities, and calm disposition, has right knowledge, is absorbed in concentration, and is not capable of ascending further on the subsidential or destructive ladder (Upashama or Ksha paka Shreni), is certainly in the ordinary Syasthana) stage of perfect (apra-matta) vows.
Commentary. This is called ordinary (Svasthana or Niratishaya), because the soul cannot rise higher from this stage; it lasts only one Antarmuhurta; and from it the soul falls down to the 6th, and re-ascends to the 7th stage, again and again. The 6th stage also lasts one antmuhurta.

47. (There are) 3 (kinds of thought-activity (karana) for the destruction or subsidence of 21 sub-classes of right-conduct-deluding-Karma (charitra moha). (These are all the 25 passions except the 4 error-feeding, Anantanubandhi passions). (He who) out of these (3), gains the first lower (thought-activity) (adhah pravritti karana,) is (in the extraordinary (satishaya, 7th stage of) perfect vow (apramatta).
Commentary. The soul which attains the extraordinary stage of perfect vow faces, and is fit to go up either the subsidential or the destructive ladder. If he is a right believer of the subsidential-destructive kind (kshayopashama samyaktva), he will first transform the Karmic matter of the 4 error feeding passions into the remaining 21 passions; then after one antarmuhurta, by the subsidence of the 3 sub-classes

of the right-belief-deluding Karma, he will become the second subsidential right believer (Dvitiyopashamasamyak-drishti); or by their destruction he will become the destructive-right-believer (kshayika-samyak-drishti). Then in one antarmuhurta, he would make thousands of journeys between the 6th and the 7th stages. Then would begin the thought-activity called (adhahkarana,) preparatory to going on to the subsidential or destructive ladder Note that, the destructive-right-believer (kshayika) also can go up the subsidential ladder, if he is not advanced enough to destroy the 21 sub-classes of right-conduct-deluding Karmas.

48. Because the thought-activity of the posterior souls may become like that of the prior souls, therefore the first of the (3 kinds of) thought activity has been said to be lower thought-activity; (Adhahpravritta Karana.)
Commentary. Karana is the name of the thought-activity in which the purity of the soul increases infinite fold at every instant (Samaya). (Adhah) means lower in level. This activity is called Adhah Karanal because by it the soul on a lower level can quickly rise to the same level of purity as a soul who has gone up before.

49. The duration of this (Lower thought-activity or Adhah Karana) is one antarhmuhurta, the thoughts in it are innumerable times the innumerable spatial units in the universe; and in the upper levels they increase in purity uniformly.

Commentary,
But here the Antarmuhurta is less than that of the lower thought activity (adhah-karana), but the number of thoughts is greater than that in the, adhah-karana. This is possible because there are many kinds of innumerable numbers, some are greater than the other.

55 Having acquired freedom from bondage (vyuchhitti) of the Karmic matter of sleep and drowsiness (Nidra and Prachala) and the age-karma still existing, (the souls in new-thought-activity), (Apurva Karana) bring about the subsidence of right-conduct-deluding Karma (Moha) (and are therefore called) subsidentials (Upashamaka), but those (who) go up the destructive ladder necessarily destroy the right-conduct-deluding Karma (and are therefore called) Destructive (Kshapaka,) and (the age Karma always exists in this ascent on the destructive laider, (Kshapaka Shreni). ekaajh kaalsmye sNtthaannaadiihiN jh nnivtttthti  /  nn nnivtttthti thaavi y prinnaamehiN miho jehiN  //  56  //  eksmin kaalsmye sNsthaanaadibhirythaa nivrtnte  /  n nivrtnne tthaapi c prinnaamaimitho yaiH // 56 //  hoti prnniyhinno te pddismyN jessimekkprinnaamaa /  vimlyr jhaann huyvh sihaahi nniddddddh kmmvnnaa  //  57 //

56-57. In one and the same instant though (the souls) differ from each other in figure, etc., yet their thoughts which do not differ are (called the Thoughts) of advanced thought-activity (Anivritti Karana). In these, only one thought-activity arises in each instant. (These thoughts), by the flames of the fire of very pure concentration are the consumers of the forest of Karmas.
Commentary. The number of thoughts in this stage is equal to the number of instants 'Samayas' in its duration. The advance in purity and generally, in this stage is perfectly uniform. Later souls can neither exceed nor come to the level of the prior souls.

58. In the Purva Sparddhaka, Apurava Sparddhaka, Badara Krishti, Suksma Krishti, the fruition (Anubhaga) of each one is infinitely less than that of the immediately preceding one. The greatest fruition in a succeeding part is infinitely less than the least fruition of the immediately preceding part, and the least fruition in any part is infinitely less than the highest fruition in the same part.
Commentary. Sparddhaka (fruition-group) is a group of molecules of Karmic matter which have the present or future capacity of fruition.
Purva Sparddhakas means Sparddhakas found in the soul before its entry in to the 9th stage. Apurva Sparddhakas are those molecules, the fruition of which has been enfeebled by the ti activity in this stage. Badara Krishti is fruition-group of even a weaker degree; and Sukshma Krishti is weaker than Badara Krishti. The Mathematics of the series (Shreni Vyavahara Ganita is as follows:-
This knowledge is necessary for calculating and ascertaining the rate, and degree of advancement in purity of thought activities in Adhah-Karana, Apurva Karana, and Anivritti Karana stages.
1, The sum (s) of the series is called Sarva-dhana or Pada
dhana.
. 2. The number of terms (n) in the series is called Pada or Gachchha.
3. The common difference (d) is Chaya or Vishesha. 4. The first term (a) is Mukha, Adi or Prabhava. 5. The last term (1) is Antadhana or Bhumi.

At all times in one instant (Samaya), the soul can have only one thought, pure or mixed. In (Adhah Karana,) a soul who enters this stage can acquire the same degree of thought-activity as that of the souls who have preceded it. The thought-activity overlaps and therefore it is called (Anukrishti). In the Apurva-Karana, the soul who enters later can never reach the thought activity acquired by the souls who entered before. But if several souls enter at the same instant, their progress onwards may be equal or unequal. Some of them may attain purer thought-activity than the others ; but none of them can ever be overtaken by any soul who enters afterwards. In (Anivritti Karana,) even those souls who enter at the same instant advance uniformly. In this stage, the soul brings about either the subsidence or destruction of all the 21 sub-classes of passions, right-conduct-deluding karma (Charitra Moha), except the 4 error-feeding passions, which were already transformed into these 21. But the soul has the very slightest form of greed which is the characteristic, which it has in the 10th stage. All but-passion less (Sukshma Samparaya.).

follow the rainy, and precede the winter season in India. They are practically the first half of winter (a season of 4 months). In the cold season all the muddy turbulence of the rains goes to the bottom, and leaves the upper water of ponds, tanks, etc., clear and transparent.
Note-that this stage is reached only by a soul who is ascending the subsidential ladder (Upashama Shreni). This is the last rung of the subsidential ladder. It is never touched by a soul who is fit to go up the destructive ladder (Kshapaka Shreni). The duration of the stage is one Antar-Muhurta, and the soul cannot progress onwards from this stage. The subsided karmic matter of the passions rises again, and the soul must fall down from this stage.

62. That possessionless saint (Nir-grantha), all of whose deluding passions (Moha Kashaya) are destroyed, and whose thought is clear like the water kept in a pure vessel of crystal jewel is said by the non-attached (Oonquerors) (to be in the 12th stage of) destroyed-delusion, or delusionless (Kshina Kashaya).
Commentary. The soul ascending the destructive ladder (Kshapaka Shreni) comes up to this stage direct from the 10th, without touching the 11th stage. In the Antar-Muhurta which is its duration, the thought-activity purifies the body very much, transforming the physical body into a highly refined (Parmaudarika), and at the close of this stage the soul's thought-activity destroys the three remaining destructive karmas (Ghatiya karmas) i. e., knowledge. obscuring, conation -obscuring, and obstructive karmas (Jnanavarniya, Darshana varniya and Antaraya) and thus reaches the next stage, that of Omniscience.

Commentary. The 9 perfect acquisitions are the nine kinds of purified thoughtactivities (Kshayika Bhava) which arise from the destruction of the 4 destructive (Ghatiya) karmas. They are :
(1) Kshayika jnana.-Purified or perfect knowledge, due to the destruction of knowledge-obscuring (jnana-varniya) karma.
(2) Kshayika Darshana.-Purified or perfect conation, due to the destruction of the conation obscuring (darsana-varniya) karma.
(3) Kshayika Dana. Purified or perfect charity, due to the destruction of charity-obstructive (Danantaraya) karma.
(4) Kshayika Labha.- Purified or perfect gain due to the destruction of gain-obstructing (Labhantraya) karma.
(5) Kshayika Bhoga.-Purified or perfect enjoyment of consumable objects due to the destruction of enjoyment-obstructive (Bhogantraya) karma,
(6) Kshayika Upabhoga. - Purified or perfect enjoyment of nonconsumable objects, due to the destruction of enjoyment-obstructing (Upbhogantaraya) karma.

(7). Kshayika Virya.- Purified or perfect power, due to the destruction of power-obstructing (Viryantaraya) karma.
(8). Kshayika Samyaktva.. Purified or perfect right belief, due to the destruction of the right-belief-deluding (Darshana Moha) karma.
(9). Kshayika Charitra, Purified or perfect right conduct, due to the destruction of right-conduct-deluding (Charitra Moha) karma.
Scriptures.-They are said to be beginningless and endless because they are co-eval with substances (Dravya); the eternal truth of which they contain in detail. The mention of the scriptures is especially appropriate here, because it is only the Arahantas, or the Adorable Lords in this stage, who give the scriptures to the world. The description of the scriptures as without beginning and end is also significant. The Arahanta sees the whole Truth and preaches it, but he adds nothing to it. The truth is perfect and has been seen, known and preached by the all-knowing in all-ages, and naturally there has been neither addition nor alteration in any of its contents hitherto, nor can there be any in the future. Truth is one for all, and for all times, and must necessarily be without beginning and without end.

Commentary.
(Nirjara). Shedding of karmic matter is either when the karma bears its fruit on maturity and falls off, (Savipaka), or when by deliberate thought-activity a karma is made to mature and fall off (Avipaka). The shedding meant in the Gatha is the antematurity shedding, due to the thought-activity of a right-believer. As right belief goes on being re-inforced by ever-increasing rectitude and purity of right conduct, the rate of shedding goes on increasing so that at each succeeding stage it increases innumerable fold.

is easy to understand this by a rough example. A huge forest is set on fire. The setting of the fire begins the consuming of the forest, but if steadily increasing streams of oil are added to the fire from all sides, the rate of consumption would increase at an incredible rate in a very short-time and the huge forest would gradually be a heap of ashes. The forest of karmas begins to be consumed by the fire of right belief. But the consumption is swift and most concentrated when the thought-activity of right conduct is taking the soul from stage to stage till it reaches Nirvana and is absorbed for ever in its own thought-activity.
The shedding relates to all the karmas except the age-karma (ayu).
This innumerable fold intensity of the shedding appears at the time of rising from one stage into another.

71. Owing to the operation of the Genus (Jati, subclass), along with four compatible sub-classes (one each of) the 4 pairs of mobile (Trasa), and immobile (Sthavara), gross (Vadara) and fine (Sukshma), developable (Paryapta) and undevelopable (Aparyapta), one-body-one-soul (Pratyeka) and one-body-many-souls (Sadharana) subclasses of body making (Nama] karma, the soul-classes (Jiya Samasa) certainly have common conotations in space and time.
Commentary. Common conotation means the sum of attributes or qualities which make up a common name, as for example animality, possession of five senses, rationality and humanity in man, because this common conotation applies to all the individuals who are found in space and are called man, it is called common conotation in space, or spatial conotation (Tiryak Samanya or Sadrishya Samanya).
But in any particular man, all these common attributes of man have existed in all his different conditions since he was born as a human being. A consideration of the common conotation as existing for all this time is called common conotation in time or time conotation (Urdhvata Samnaya or Tadbhava Samanya).
The genus (Jati) of mundane souls is of 5 kinds according to their possession of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 senses.
All these souls may be mobile or immobile. All the one sense souled are immobile, the rest are mobile.
(2) They may be gross or fine; all the souls are gross, only some of the one-sensed souls are fine.
(3) All the souls are either developable or not.
(4) All the souls occupy one body each, except some vegetable souls who share their body with other souls.
One and not more than one of these four pairs of distinction must be found in a soul at any time. But the 4 must be compatible;

for example mobile soul cannot be fine; nor can it occupy same body jointly with many, thus the necessity of compatability gives us 14 following soul classes as given in gatha 72.

72. The one-sensed souls, fine and gross, the 2, 3, and 4-sensed, (the five sensed), irrational and rational - all these being developable and non-developable make 14 (classes.)
Commentary, This gatha enumerates the fourteen soul-classes which may be shown thus:
(1) Fine ] One sensed. (2) Gross (3) ... ... Two sensed. Each of these may be (4) ... ... Three sensed. (1) Developable or (5) ... ... Four sensed. (2) Non-developable. (6) Irrational Five sensed. (7) Rational , ,
One-sensed Souls are of 5 kinds- earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, air-bodied, and vegetable-bodied. Each of these 5 kinds is fine-bodied, as well as gross-bodied.
Fine-bodied one-sensed souls of all five kinds, permeate all space in the universe. They are incapable of causing hurt to or being hurt by others. They die of themselves, when their age-Karma is worked out. They penetrate and pass through every kind of matter, howsoever gross or solid.
Gross-bodied (Vadara) souls are those that can hurt and be hurt by other gross-bodied ones.
More-than-one-sensed souls are all gross-bodied. (Vadara). See gatha 183-184.
(Sanjni and Asanjni) - The division of rational (Sanjni) and irrational (Asanjni) Souls is applicable only to the five-sensed Souls. All other Souls are irrational.

Nigoda - The group-souled vegetable kingdom is called "Nigoda'. Those multitudinous souls that have their body, nourishment, and age in common are called host-souls (Sadharana). They take their birth together, live together and die together. Their life-span is very short.
Some of these, after having once come out of the Nigoda condition, and entered into higher forms of life, again fall back into the condition of Nigoda. These are called "Chaturgati-Nigoda", "or " Itara-Nigoda." While those infinite souls who have so far never entered into any condition of life higher than that of. Nigoda, are called " Nitya Nigoda."

Pratyeka Vanaspati. This is an individual-souled Vegetablebodied soul, whose body is dominated by a single soul. Pratyeka Vanaspati may be (1) Sapratishthita (host-individualsouled, (2) Apratishthita (Non-host-individual-souled.)
The first also supports various host-souls, while the second does not, and is purely individual-souled.
Generally the same vegetables which are host-individualsouled (Sapratishthia) in the beginning, become non-host-individualsouled (Aptratishthia) when nerves and their other distinctive features have appeared on the out-side also. Let us take an apple for example. So long as the nerves and the outer contours do not all appear, it is regarded as Sapratishtita; but when they have appeared, the host souls thriving on it, cease to exist any longer and it becomes purely individual.
But there are certain vegetables that continue to be hostindividual-souled throughout. Root vegetables may be regarded as belonging to this class.
The two kinds of Non-developable souls are:
(1). Nirvrittya-paryapta (Pontentially developable) and Labdhyaparyapta (Absolutely Non-developable).
(2).
The first are those that are in the condition of Non-developableness for an antar-muhurta but shall become developable afterwards, while the second are those that shall die within an antar-muhurta without becoming so developable. Their age-duration is th part of the time of one pulse beat of a healthy person.

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
This gatha gives us the Five hundred and seventy soul classes as shown in the table. For illustration, let us take the 10th variety. If we simply multiply it by one, irrespective of the distinction of developable, and non-developable, we get ten soul classes. If we distinguish them as developable and non-developable we shall have twenty soul classes. Again if we distinguish them as developable, potentially developable, and absolutely non-developable, we get thirty soul classes. Thus we have at the maximum thirty soul classes in the tenth variety, at the minimum ten classes, and at the medium twenty classes. Similarly, if we add all the classes in all the varieties from one to nineteen, we get at the minimum total 190, at the medium 380, and at the maximum 570 soul classes. The division of souls into 570 classes, it should be noted, is meant only for clear exposition and grasp of the different varieties of souls. Strict. ly and logically, there are only ninety-eight (98) soul classes, as shown in the following two gathas.

Of these in the conch like circular nucleus, as a rule, Uterine birth.is denied.
_ Commentary. Necleus may be divided according to its form, (Akara) or characteristic (Guna), The above 3 divisions are according to the form, and the divisions, according to characteristic, are given in Gatha 83.
There is no uterine birth in the conch-circled nucleus. It is found in goddesses and in some of the wives of (Chakravarti) Rajas.

82. In the tortoise-high nucleus, Tirthankaras, the two kinds of Chakravartins and also Balbhadras are born. In the remaining (bamboo-leaf like nucleus) other human beings (are born).
Commentary. Tirthankaras-are the proclaimers of liberation and the guides on the path to it. Their number is twenty-four in each cycle of time in each of the Bharat, and Airavata-kshetras.
Chakravartinsare the monarchs of all the six parts of Bharat kshetra or Airavata kshetra. They are twelve in each cycle of time in each of the two regions.

Chakravartins are of two kinds. An Ardha Chakravartin rules over three out of 6 parts of one of the 2 Kshetras, each consisting of one arya-khanda and 5 Mlechha-khanda. Sakala Chakvartins rule over all the six parts of a Kshetra.
An Ardha-chakravarti, may be either a Narayana or his opponent Pratinarayana. The elder brother of a Narayana is called Baldeva or Balabhadra. In each cycle of time, there are nine Narayanas, nine Pratinarayanas and nine Balabhadras.
In each of the two Kshetras there are 24 Tirthamkaras, 12 Chakvartins, 9 Narayanas, 9 Prati-Narayanas, and 9 Balbhadras the 63 Great men (Shalaka-Purusha), who flourish in each Avasarpini and Utsarpini, the descending and the ascending arc of the cycle of time.

Commentary. The nucleus where a soul takes birth must have the following characteristics. Its matter, must be either living or non-living, or a combination of living or non-living; it must be either hot, or cold or a combination of hot and cold ; it must be either covered, or

88. Generally thus there are nine nuclei (but) in detail, there are by rule eighty-four Lakhs of Nuclei.
Commentary.
Note that all souls with 1, 2, 3, or 4 senses are necessarily born by spontaneous generation. Only the 5 sensed souls are born in all the 3 possible ways by spontaneous generacion, uterine birth, and instantaneous rise.
Note also that celestial and hellish beings are 5 sensed and born by instantaneous rise. Both are born in a covered nucleus, the celestial being born in a sort of box-bed and the hellish beings in a sort of bladder hung from the ceilings of their holes in hell.
Note also that all the egg-born souls must be five sensed although they may be with or without mind. The pigeon or dove is a five sensed being with mind. The nuclei for the hellish beings

92. Absolutely non-developable souls, by rule, never have instantaneous rise or uterine birth, while human souls of spontaneous generation are only absolutely nondevelopable.
Commentary.
Human souls of spontaneous generation are born in the armpits, womb and breasts of females in Arya Khanda, excepting those of the prime queen of a Chakravartin. They are also born in dirty places where urine, night-soil and such like things are laid. They are not visible to the human eye. There life is the shortest. They are born and they die 18 times in one pulse-beat, which is 3772nd part of a muhurta i. e. 48 minutes.

93. Hellish souls are invariably bi-sexual or hermaphrodite, and sub-human souls are (of all) the three (sexes, e. g. masculine, feminine and common); (human and subhuman) souls of spontaneous generation are of common sex; the celestial souls and the inhabitants of enjoyment region, (Bhoga-bhumi) are either of masculine or of feminine sex.
Commentary.
Sexes are of two kinds :
(1) Sex organ and (2) sex-inclination. Sex organs are due to the operation of Angopanga, limbs and minor limbs sub-class of the

Celestial and hellish beings, and those born in the Bhoga-bhumi, and those born by spontaneous generation have the sex inclination corresponding to their sex organ, but this is not essential in the rest the human and the sub-human beings.

94: The size of the body of a fine-bodied and non-developable (Nigoda) soul in the third instant after it has taking birth in its nucleus (i. e. after its vigrahagati or passage for transmigration) is an innumerable part of one (cubic) finger (anguli). This is the minimum (bodily size). The maximum size is fonnd in the fish born in the last and the biggest ocean called Svayambhuramana of the world.
Commentary.
The body of a fine-bodied non-developable Nigoda-vegetable soul is oblong in the first instant of its birth, square in the second instant, and in the third instant it contracts and becomes circular. In the circular state the dimentions of its body are at their minimum, after the third instant it begins to grow.

(amongst the two sensed, incomplete-sensed souls) (the conch of the Svayambhuramana ocean) is twelve (Yojans long), the red Scorpion, a three-sensed soul of the Sva. yambhuramana continent is (one krosa less one (Yojana long; the Black Bee, a four sensed soul of the above continent is) one (Yojana Long) (and amongst the five sensed souls) the Great Fish (Maha Matsya of the same ocean) (is) one thousand Yojanas (long).
Commentary. Space (Akasha) is divided into the universe (Loka-kasha) and non-universe (aloka-kasha). The unverse is divided into three parts. The upper universe, (Urdhva Loka), the middle universe (Maddhya Loka,) and the lower world (Adhah-Loka). The upper universe and that alone contains the heavenly order (kalpavasi) of celestial beings. In the centre of the middle universe there is Mount Meru. It is surrounded on all sides by Jambu Dvipa, a continent hay diameter of 1.00.000 large yojans. Jambu Dvipa is encircled by the ocean. Lavanodadhi, 2,00,000 large yojans in diameter ; this is encircled by the continent Dhatuki khanda 4,00,000 large yojans in diameter; encircled by the occan Kalo Dadhi 8,00,000 large yojans in diameter; this is encircled by the continent Pushkaravara-dvipa 16,00,000 large yojans in diamater. Puskaravara dvipa is bisected throughout by the mountain Manu-shottara, so called because no human beings can exist beyond this mountain. Beyond Pushkaravara dvipa there are innumerable oceans and continents, the diameter of each one being double of that of its predecessor. The last continent is Svayamb-huramana and the last ocean is also called Svayambhu ramana. The last continent is divided in its middle by the mountain Svayamprabha. The first 2 continents and the first 2 oceans have both Karma and Bhoga Bhumis. The last ocean and half of the last continent next to the ocean have got pnly Karma Bhumi. The rest of the oceans ard continents have only Bhoga Bhumi.
The middle universe is the abode of 3 orders of celestial beings i.e., the residentials (Bhavanavasi). pripetatics (Vyantara) and Stellars (Jyotisha) orders, as also of the human and sub-human beings. Human and sub-humanbeings both of Karma and Bhoga Bhumi are found in the first two oceans and the first 2) continents. i.e. up to the Manushottara. No human beings of any kind are found anywhere else in the universe. One sensed beings are found in the whole universe. 2 to 4 sensed and 5 sensed irrational beings are found

only in the first 2 oceans, first 2} continents, last continent and the last ocean. Five sensed rational human beings are found only in the first 2! continents and the first 2 oceans. Five-sensed rational subhuman beings of the Bhoga-Bhumi type are found everywhere except the last half continent and the last ocean.
Beyond Manushottara up to the Syayamprabha there are only 5 sensed animals with mind, only of the Bhoga Bhumi type. In the last continent and the last ocean there are all kinds of sub-human animals of the Karma Bhumi type.
The enormous, almost unimaginable, extent of the last of the innumerable continents and oceans is evident from the fact that Jambudvipa the first of them is one lac yojans in diameter. Each yojan being of the larger kind which is 500 times of the smaller yojan which is equal to 4 koses or 8 miles. Thus the diamete of Jambudvipa is 40,00,00,000 miles. This figure is doubled in a geometric-progression and it is impossible for the ordinary human mind to conceive it when we consider the dimensions of the last ocean.
The lotus in the last ocean has a stalk 1000 yojans long and 1 yojan in diameter. Its whole volume is about 750 cubic yojans. And the great fish there, is 1000 yojans long, 500 broad and 250 yojans thick.
These huge dimensions of living beings are quite in keeping with the dimensions of Swayambhu ramana samudra, the last and biggest of all the oceans in the universe. and they are quite possible and reasonable. These matters like all others, are quite plain to the Omniscient, who is the ultimate source of our knowledge about them. Here one Yojana is equal to four Krosas, or 8 miles. This is the ordinary short Yojana which is used for measuring bodies. The great Yojana which is five-hundred times greater is used in showing the measures of continents and oceans etc.

Commentary.
For example, let us suppose that the size of Anundhari is 1000 cubic finger and suppose the multiplicant is 2, then the size of Kunthu would be, that of Kana Makshika 3-2 and that of Sikthaka matsya would be cubic finger.
It will be seen that the minimum bodily size of any developable mobile soul is only some part of cubic finger.
The method of finding out the different variations in bodily sizes between the minimum and the maximum is described in the following five gathas :

102. The first stage in the innumerable-part-increase (asamkhyata bhaga-vriddhi) is reached by adding one 'spatial unit' (pradesh) to the minimum size. Further than this there is consistently an increase of one spatial unit (in every subsequent size.)
Commentary. The minimum bodily size has innumerable spatial units. From this it grows by four kinds of increase till the size in the second place (i. e. that of fine non-developable air-bodied souls) is arrived at. The increase is of six kinds namely.
1. Infinite-part increase (ananta-bhaga vriddhi). 2. Innumerable part-increase (asamkhyata bhaga vriddhi). 3. Numerable-part-increase (samkhyata bhaga vriddhi). 4. Numerable fold increase (samkhyata guna vriddhi.) 5. Innumerable fold increase (asamkhyata guna vriddhi. 6. Infinite-fold-increase (ananta-guna vriddhi).
Besides these six, there is also a seventh increase called indescribeable (avaktavya). It operates between the end of one increase and the beginning of another.
Out of these six kinds of increases the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th increases only apply in the increase of size. The first and the last, infinite part and infinitefold increases are out of question since the spatial units of all sizes from the minimum to the maximum are not infinite but innumerable only. The process of the four increases is shown in the following gathas.

The highest stage in the innumerable part (increase) is reached (when a number equal to the minimum size plus the quotient obtained by dividing the number of spatial units of the minimum size by the minimum preliminary innumerable, (Jaghanya parita samkhyata, a kind of innumerable) is obtained.

The last stage of this (increase) is reached when a number equal to the minimum size plus the quotient obtained by dividing the minimum by the maximum numerical number minus one is obtained. By adding one to that i. e. (the last stage of indescribable increase we get) the first stage of the numerable part-increase. Above that there is a gradual increase of one (spatial unit).

117. The total kinds of bodily materials of all bodied souls are one Koda-Kodi (one hundred million, 10 m. x 10 m.), ninety-seven lacs, and fifty thousand crores.
Commentary.
Physique (Kula) is natural constitution. Its characteristics are dependant upon the kind of material molecules of which the physical (audurika) and fluid (vaikriyika) bodies are made. The distinction of physique is due to the operation of the high and low subclasses of the family-determining Karma (Gotra Karma)-This Karma is ever operative along with the body-making, the age-determining, and the feeling Karma (Nama, Ayu, and Vedaniya).
This simultaneous co-operation is obvious. The age Karma is a sort of winding up of the whole machinery. Its existence means the existence of the age vitality. It being exhausted, the whole machinery of a particular mundane condition of existence comes to stop. The body making Karma determines the condition of existence, the genus of beings, their bodies, limbs, formation, molecular bondage, interfusion, figure, osseous structure of the body and their various functions, capacities, and effects at-rest and in-motion. The family-determining Karma (Gotra) determines the high or low class of family in which the soul takes birth. The principle of heredity seems to be recognised by Jainism here. In developing its body and senses the soul chooses and assimilates the kinds of material molecules which are in consonance with the character of the family determined for its birth by the family-determining Karma (gotra). The different sorts of constitution of the material molecules of which the physical and fluid bodies are formed are the different physiques mentioned here. A rough obvious observation may be made in this connection by seeing that the constitution of the material body of dog, deer, goat, sheep, lion, man, different kinds of women, plants,

119. (The capacity of) assimilating (the molecules of Ahara Vargana of which the external bodies are formed, capacities of forming) body and sense, (the capacity of) (breathing, the capacity of) speech and mind are the six developable capacities (paryapti). (Out of them) four, five and six belong (in their regular order) to one sensed, incomplete sensed (i.e. two, three, four and irrational five sensed) and rational (five sensed souls).
Commentary. The soul immediately after its vigrahagati i.e. passage from one incarnation to another, assimilates to itself the molecules of Ahara vargana out, ofwhich are formed its body, the senses, and breathing, of bhasa-vargana i.e. sound molecules, out of which speech is formed, and of mano-vargana or mind molecules out of which the mind organ in the shape of an eight petalled lotus within the heart is formed. The gaining of the capacity by the soul to develope the different kinds of molecules into their resultant bodily characterstics is called Paryapti or developableness. As shown above there are in all six Paryaptis out of which one-sensed souls can gain, only the first four; and the two-sensed, three-sensed, foursensed, and irrational five-sensed can gain only the first five; and only a rational five-sensed soul can gain all the six.
The difference between the first and the second Paryapti i.e. Ahara and Sharira is that while the first helps in transforming the Ahara vargana molecules into liquid and solid forms, the second effects the formation of the trunk, flesh, blood and bones etc.
Vikalendriya, incomplete sensed, here include irrational fivesensed sculs.

120. The gaining of the capacities starts simultaneously, but the completion (of each of them), is effected gradually within the period of one antar.muhurta, which increases in the case of each succeeding one. (Yet their total period does not exceed one antar-muhurta),
Commentary. Whatever time is taken in the completion of the first development (assimilation, Ahara), a numerable (Sankhyata) part of it being added to it gives the time taken by the next (body Sharira) development. A numerable (Sankhyata) part of the time taken by body developement being added to it gives the time taken by the senses (Indriya) development. A numerable part of the time taken in sense-development being added to it gives the time for the next respiration development, and so on till the 6th. It must be noted that the most complete development of all the capacities never takes more than one antar-muhurta This is so because there are many kinds of an Antar-muhurta, the minimum being an avali and 1 Samaya and the maximum, 48 minutes minus 1 Samaya.
Let Sankhyata be, S.
The value of S may be different in the 6 developments. Let antar-muhurta be A. At the first intstant of birth, the operation of the development of body-making-Karmas begins in a developable soul. It begins to develope all the 6 or less developments simultaneously. Assimilation development takes time A to be completed.

Each one of the six periods i.e. A to A( 1+) is an antarmuhurta. And the total of all the six also is an antar-muhurta.
The total - AS ( 1+5)-1 } If S is considered to be the same sankhayata. If S is different, the total will be something else.
Now suppose S to be the minimum sankhayata i.e. 2: and A to be the minimum antar-muhurta i.e. one avali + 1 instant,

Then the total is equal to 20 avalis + 20% instants. This is the minmum period of Paryapti for a developable rational soul.
The total time of the first two developments is equal to A + A( 1+1= A(2+ 1)- Pavalis +gsamayas.
According to Karma Kanda Gatha 218 to 241, the first and only the first instant of this time is that of birth vibratory division (upapada yoga sthana), and the rest except the last instant are the Increasing-Vibratoy-division (Ekantanuvriddhi yoga sthana). In other words there is the initiatory and minimum vibratory activity in the 1st instant; there is increasing activity for Avalis + half instant ; i.e. from the second up to the last but one instant ; and in and from the last instant onwards there is the Changing Vibratory division (Parinama yoga sthana). This lasts up to the last instant of one's life.

121, The completion of the Paryapties (of each class of souls) is effected by the operation of the developable body-making Karma (Paryapti Nama-Karma). So long as the body (formation capacity) is.incomplete, the soul is (called) potentially developable (nirvrittyaparyapta).

Commentary.
The antar-muhurta for the life of an absolutely non-developable soul is always equal to one-eighteen of a pulsation. It should be noted that there are 3773 pulsations in one muhurtai. e., 48 minutes in the case of a healthy man.

Commentary.
Here the antar-muhurta is equal to 3685 3 pulsations. Now there being eighteen births and deaths within one pulsation, there will be 66336 births and deaths in one antar-muhurta.

Commentary.
This gatha gives us the maximum number of births and deaths which a soul possessed of different senses can consecutively undergo within one antar-muhurta. It means that the same soul cannot be born more than the prescribed number of times in the same class continuously in one antar-muhurta, although the duration of each life will not be more than one eighteenth of pulsation.
Of the twenty-four births of a five-sensed being, there can be eighty human births, eight irrational five-sensed sub-human, and eight rational five-sensed sub-human births.

126. An (omniscient) vibratory soul, with bodily vibrations, with a developable-body, and subject to the operation of developable (body making-karma) is called incomplete vibratory soul (apurna-yoga) when where is incompleteness (of development).
Commentary. When in the case of a vibratory omniscient soul the duration of age Karma is less than that of each of the other three AghatiyaKarmas, there is an over-flow of the spatial units of the soul, in order to equalize the duration of all the four Aghatiya Karmas. This over-flow occupies eight instants. In the first instant it is elongated like a stick (danda), in the second it broadens out like a door-leaf (Kapata), in the third it spreads out up to the 3 universe encircling (pratara) atmospheres, and in the fourth it occupies the whole universe (Loka-purna). There is an immediate withdrawal backward and the stages are retraced in the same lir instants until the spatial units resume the original physical form when the over-flow onwards and the withdrawn backwards is in the

127. Absolutely non-developable souls (are only ) in (the stage of ) wrong belief ( the first spiritual stage), Potentially developable souls in this (i. e., the first) and also in the second (downfall Sasadana), the fourth, and the sixth stages (i. e., vowless right belief Avirata Samyaktva and incomplete vow pramatta-virata). The developable souls have these as also the rest of the thirteen stages).
Commentary.
Developableness does not go beyond the thirteenth stage, as in the fourteenth stage it is not possible owing to the absence of soul vibrations.
The reason for a potentially developable soul being in the first, second and fourth spiritual stages is that during the course of transmigration (vigragati) the soul is always in one of these stages and the same stage continues after assumption of a body, till it becomes developable i. e., gains its Paryaptis. The reason for a potentially developable soul being in the sixth stage is that the spiritual man-like emanation (Aharaka sharira) is formed in this stage only; and during the course of its formation the condition of the saint is that of potential developableness.

(the six lowest hells) ; to (the celestials whether) stellar (jyotishka)Paripatetic (vyantara) residential (Bhavanavasi) and to all females. There is no down-fall stage (Sasadana) in the nondevelopable condition of hellish souls.
Commentary. The spiritual stage (Gunasthana) present during the transition period until rebirth, (Vigrahagati) continues in the soul's nondevelopable condition for an antar-muhurta. One who retains Samyaktva till death would not be born in the conditions detailed in the above gatha, and it is not possible to acquire Samyaktva in the non-developable condition. Thus there is no Samyaktva in the non-developable condition set out above.
One who is in the downfall stage at the time of death, never goes to hell. Thus there is no Sasadana stage in the non-developable condition.

129. As by external life-forces, so also by internal life-forces (all mundane) souls have their existence, Both of these life-forces are Vitalities (prana). (This) has been laid down.
Commentary. Vahya-prana (external vitalities) - The activities of the five material senses, the body, speech, mind, respiration and age are said to be the external vitalities (Vahya or Dravyaprana). While the activity of inner consciousness or the internal motive force, which are due to the destructive-subsidence of the knowledgeobscuring and power-obstructing Karmas and to the operation of other Karmas and which are the stimulating cause of the external activities are called internal vitalities (Abhyanatara or Bhava prana). Paryapti is the attainment of the capacity of developing body, mind, speech, and the five senses, while Prana is the activity of those functionaries.

Commentary. For the production of respiration, and speech vitalities, along with the operation of the body-making karma the operation of respiration (Uchchhvas) Karma and voice (Swara) Karma are also necessary, respectively.

Amongst the others (i. e., non-developables) (there are) seven (vitalities) in the two (i.e., the rational and irrational five-sensed (souls) and in the rest one less in each, (respectively).
Commentary.
Injury (Himsa) is defined as the deprivation through carelessness (Pramada) of any one or more of the vitalities (Prana) of a soul. Really speaking it is the vitalities to which injury is caused, neither the soul nor the matter which encases a mundane soul is susceptible to any injury whatsoever. They are both indestructible in their essence. The degree of sin would depend upon the number of vitalities, and their comparative strength, to which injury is caused. The knowledge of the varying number of vitalities possessed by souls in their various conditions of life enables one to judge of the extent of injury he is likely to cause in his actions. The following table would prove useful.

Commentary. 1. Food (Ahara), 2. Fear (Bhaya), 3. Coition (Maithuna), and 4. Attachment (Parigraha), are called the four animate-feelings. They characterize all mundane souls. They are destroyed by following the Right Path. Even one-sensed souls are affected by the above feelings. Recent scientific discoveries have demonstrated this fact in case of plants.

136. The animate feeling of Fear is aroused by four (causes)-by the sight of some very fearful object, by attention towards it (through rememberance, or on account of hearing stories relating to fearful objects and incidents), by weakness of mind ; (as well as) by the premature ope. ration of fear-karma (a minor passion, and a sub-division of Right-conduct-deluding-karma, an internal cause).

139. On the destruction of carelessness (pramada, which exists till the sixth spritual stage), there remains no first animate feeling (i. e., desire for food), because of the absense of the (internal) cause; the remaining (three animate feelings) owing to the presence of their (causative) Karma, from a figurative point of view, still exist though they are not effective.
Commentary. Among the four causes of each of the four feelings, the internal cause is all-supreme. The other causes are effective only when there is the force of Karmas behind. Desire for food arises from the premature operation (Udirana) of pain-feeling (Asata-Vedaniya) Karma. Such operation is possible till the sixth Spiritual stage only. Therefore there is no desire for food beyond the sixth Stage. Fearminor-passion Karma operates only up to the Eighth, Sex-inclination minor-passion Karma up to the ninth, and greed-passion-Karma up to the tenth Spiritual Stage. But from the seventh stage onwards, their operation is so weak as not to disturb the meditative Saint in any manner. Thus the last three animate-feelings do not really exist beyond sixth Stage. They are said to exist only in a figurative way because the causative Karmas have not till then subsided or been destroyed.

141 Know (them to be ) the soul-quests, by means of which, or amongst which souls, as seen in scriptural knowledge, are searched for. They are fourteen.
Commentary.
A general knowledge about souls has already been imparted to us in the foregoing chapters on spiritual stages, soul-classes, developables and Vitalities. Soul-quests are intended to give us a detailed knowledge of souls.

142. The fourteen soul-quests are :
1. Condition of existence (gati). 2. sense (indriya), 3, Embodiment (kaya), 4. Vibratory activity (Yoga), 5 Sexinclination (Veda ). 6. Passion ( Kashaya), 7. Knowledge (Jnana), 8. Control (samyama), 9. Conation (Darshana ), 10. Thought-paint (Leshya), 11. Liberableness (Capacity of) attaining liberation from karmic bondage (Bhavyatva) 12. Right-belief ( Samyaktva), 13. Rationality (Samjnitva), and 14. Assimilation (of matter, (Ahara).

143-144 There are eight with-interval-soul-quests (Santara margana). In case of) 1. Subsidential (Right belief, upashama samyaktva), 2. Slightest-(Delusion control, sukshma samparaya samyama), 3. Assimilative(body.vibratory-activity, Aharaka-Kava-Yoga), 4. Mixed (Assimilative-body vibratory activity, Aharaka Mishra - Yoga), 5. Fluid-mixed (body-vibratory-activity, vaikriyika Mishra Yoga), 6. Absolutely non-developable human soul (Labdhyaparyaptaka Manushya), 7. Downfall belief (Sasadana samyaktva) and 8. Mixed (Belief-mishra-Samyaktva). The maximum (interval for each of these, respectively) is (1) Seven days, (2) Six months, (4) Seven years, (4) (Eight years), (5) Twelve Muhurtas, and for (6) (7) and (8) the part of a Palya ; but the minimum (time) is one instant (samaya, for each of these).
Commentary. As a rule souls exist in each of the various soul-quests at every instant (samaya). The only exceptions to this general rule are enumerated, with their maximum and minimum intervals, in the above two gathas. For example, there may sometimes, be a total absence in the whole universe, of any soul in the Subsidential Rightbelief i. e., in the twelfth soul quest. But this absence can last at the maximum for seven days, or at the minimum for one instant, except in the case of souls in the partial-vow, and imperfect-vow (fifth and sixth) spiritual stages, when according to the following gatha, the interval may extend to fourteen, and fifteen days, respectively.

145. But (in cases of souls) having first subsidential Right-Belief, (when) in Partial vow and Imperfect-vow, (stages), the interval of total absence should be known to be of fourteen, and fifteen days (respectively).

146. Condition of existence (Gati) is the state (of a soul), brought about by the operation of the body-condition-making (Gati-Nama-Karma) or it is the cause of the soul's passing in either of the four conditions of existence. The four kinds of the conditions of existence are 1. Hellish (Naraka) 2. Sub-human (Tiryanch), 3. Human (Manushya) and 4. Celestial (Deva).

147. Naratas (unamused, or Narakas, Hellish) are so called because they do never like the objects, place, time and the conditions (in which they are placed), nor (do they like) each other.
Commentary. The derivative meaning of the word, naraka, hellish soul is given here. All the objects, and surroundings in hell are altogether disagreeable. The very name, "Narata' or (Naraka) signifies that the hellish beings do not at all like the conditions of hell, nor do they like each other.

148. Tiryanchas (crooked or subhuman souls) are so called because they adopt crooked thought-activities, have open indulgence in their animate feelings, are in a very low position (as regards their body-enjoyment, etc.,) have little knowledge, and have multifarious grave demerits, mnnnnNti jdo nnicN mnnenn nniunnaa mnnukddaa jmhaa  /  mnnnnutthbhvaa y svve tmhaa te maannusaa bhnnidaa  //  146 //  mnynte yto nityN mnsaa nipunnaa mnsotkttaa ysmaat  /  mnuudbhvaashc srve tsmaatte maanussaa bhnnitaaH  //  146  // 
149. Manushah (men) are so called because they always have discrimination, are mentally well-qualified, strong of will, and are descended from the Manus (or Kulakaras, the leaders of men).
Commentary. Manus or Kulakaras are born in the Bharata and Airavata Kshetras just at the beginning of the transformation of Bhogabhumi or enjoyment conditions into Karma-bhumi or work-condi. tions. They are sixteen in number, and one follows the other, after definite intervals. They instruct the people into the new ways of living, and hence they have been spoken of as the chief ancestors of all men. In the present age, here, Nabhi Raja was the fourteenth, his son Shri Rishabha-Deva, the first Tirthamkara, the fifteenth, and his son Bharata Chakravarti, after whom the country is called Bharat-Kshetra, was the last and the sixteenth.

151. Devas (Celestials) are so called because they always amuse themselves with their eight heavenly acquisitions, and have shining heavenly constitutions.
Commentary. The eight heavenly acquisitions of the celestials, which are theirs by nature, are the following: -
1. Anima-this enables them to make their body very small. 2. Mahima - is the opposite of the first and helps them to extend
their badies to any dimensions. 3. Laghima-by which they can make their bodies very light. 4. Garima by which they can make their bodies very heavy. 5. Sakama Rupitva- by which they can at will adopt any
forms, and any number of bodies at one time. 6. Vashitva - by which they can bring others under subjection, 7. Ishitva  by which they can exhibit superiority. 8. Prakamya power to act as they desire.
Heavenly constitution. The constitution of celestial souls is technically called 'Vaikriyika, Sharira' Fluid-body. The celestial beings can assume any form they like. The body has no flesh, blood, and bones, and there are no filthy excretions from it. It is very lustrous.

152. The condition of Liberation (Siddha-Gati) is that in which there are no birth, dotage, death or fear, (no) miseries arising from (undesirable accompaniments, and from deprivation (of desirable objects), (no) animatefeelings, and no diseases, etc.
Commentary. The condition of liberated souls is described here. Liberation Toplies freedom from Karmic matter, which shrouds the real glory of the soul, drags it into various conditions, and makes it experience multifarious pleasures and pains. But when all the Karmas are destroyed the soul, which by nature has got an up-ward motion rises to the highest point of the Universe-the Siddha-shila and there lives for endless time in the enjoyment of its own glorious qualities unencumbered by the worldly pleasures or pains. This is the ideal condition of a soul. saamnnnnaa nneriyaa ghnnaNgul bidiymuulgunnseddhii /  bidiyaadi baardsddchttidunnijpdhidaa seddhii  //  153 //

153. Hellish souls in all fare equal to the number of the spatial units in) (Jagat) shreni (the universe line) multiplied by the second square root (i. e, the fourth root) of one cubic finger (ghanangula). (Hellish souls) in the second and other (i, e, the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh hells are in number equal to the quotient of the spatial units of the (universal) line divided by its own twelyth, tenth, eighth, sixth, third and second root (respectively).
Commentary, This gatha gives the method for calculating the number of hellish beings in total, and in each hell. The method may be illustrated thus. Suppose one cubic finger (ghanangula) to be 16 spatial units, and the universal line = 256 S. U. Then the total number of all hellish souls would be 256 x 16 - 256 X 94 - 256 X 2-512.

Commentary. The universe is 7 Rajus in breadth. The universal line is also 7 Rajus in length. It is called Jagat Shreni. Its square is called Jagat pratara-the universe surface area. A Raju comprises innumerable yojanas. The middle part of the universe is one Raju in breadth.

168. The power of cognisance (of the senses, in the souls in whom they first appear is) respectively square of twenty, eight, and ten bow lengths (dhanushas) - three thousand minus forty-six of yojanas, and eight thousand bow-lengths. It increases double fold (continuously in the case of two-sensed), to irrational (five-sensed souls ).

Commentary.
The actual calculation works like this:
/ ( 100000 - 360 ) 2 x 10 x 9 = 60 99640 X 9 : 60/10 - 14946 / 10 -47263-392042 Yojans.

The last is thus equal to a numerable part of a cubic finger.
Commentary. These are the sizes only of the internal organs, and not of their protecting environments (Upakarana) which are much larger and differ in each individual.

Commentary. This gatha is identical with gatha 94.
As the soul' entirely similar in form to and co-retensive with the body, the spatial units of the inner sense organs are the same as those of the corresponding part of the soul.

178. If we divide a square finger breadth (Pratarangula) by an innumerable number, and then divide by this quotient the square of the universal line (Jagata pratara) we obtain the total number of the 2, 3, 4 and 5 sensed (souls). The number (of the two to five sensed beings) is in a decreasing order, and the common divisor is an innymerable part of a wink (Avali).

179. (Divide the total number of the mobiles by an innumerable part of an Avali. From total subtract the quotient, the balance is Bahubhaga. (Divide the Bahubhaga equally into these four 2, 3, 4 and 5 sensed). (The remaining) one part (i. e. The quotient) is to be treated in the above way. (Divided by an innumerable part of an Avali, from it, subtract the quotient. That will give its Bahubhaga) here also give this Bahubhaga (greater part) to the most numerous class and so on.
Commentary. Suppose the total of mohiles is 26,244 and an innumerable part of Avali is9 then 26244-9-2916.26244-2916-23328, this is the greater part or Bahubhaga. This divided into the 4 classes gives each of them 5832.
Now treat 2916 in the same way. 2916 : 9 - 324. 2916-324 - 2592. this is the 2nd Bahubhaga, give this to the most numerous class i. e. the 2 sensed beings. Thus the total of 2 sensed beings is 5832+2592-8424. The last quotient is 324. 324-9-36. 324-36-288. this is the next Bahubhaga, give it to the next most numerous class.

Therefore the 3-sensed beings are 5832+288-6120. The last quotient 369 4, 36-4-32, the next as Bahubhaga. This + 5832 gives the total of the 4 sensed beings 5864. The last quotient is 4; give it to the last class. Therefore the total of 5-sensed beings is 5832+4-5836.
The grand total of the 4 totals is 26244.

180. Divide the square of the unversal line, ( Jagat Pratara) by an innumerable part of the square of a finger breadth, (pratarangula, ) ( and the result is) the total num - ber of developable 3, 2, 5 and 4 sensed. (Their respective numbers are in a) gradually decreasing order. Deduct (the number of) developables (from the total number, and the balance represents the number of) undevelopLables of the 2, 3, 4 and 5, sensed souls.
Commentary.
The process of finding out the respective number of each of the 3, 2, 5 and 4 sensed is the same as laid down in the previous Gatha No. 179. Here also the divisor is the innumerable part of an Avali.

Commentary. The embodiments kaya are of six kinds (1) earth, (2) water (3) fire (4) air, (5) vegetable and (6) mobile bodies. Souls are accordingly earth, water, fire, air and mobile vegetable bodied. Mobile beings are ealled, Trasa, from the Sanskrit root, tras, to fear, because, they have the natural inclination to move away from objects of fear. Immobiles do not behave in this manner.

Commentary. Each of the above four embodiments are of four kinds. Tak ing earth into consideration we have:
1. Earth in general, samanya Prithvi.
2. Earth-soul, Prithvi-Jiva, the soul which is in transmigratory passage, Vigrahagati, immediately before being born as earth bodied.
3. Earth bodied soul, the soul which has taken an earth-body. (Prithvi Kayika).
4 Earth-body, (Prithvi Kava). Water, fire, and air also are of the above four kinds. baadrsuhumudyenn y baadrsuhumaa hvNti tdehaa /  ghaadsriirN thuulN aghaaddehN hve suhmN  // 183 //  baadrsuukssmodyen c baadrsuukssmaa bhvnti tdehaaH /  ghaatshriirN sthuulmghaatdehN bhvet suukssmm  //  183  //

Commentary. Ghata sharira, an obstructive body is a gross body which obstructs and is obstructed by other objects. A body which neither obstructs nor is obstructed by other objects is aghata sharira nonobstructive or a fine body. A fine body can pass through any kind of matter.
Gross bodies are called destructible or obstructive because they alone can destroy each other. Fine bodies are in destructible or non-obstuctive because nothing can kill them and they can kill nothing. They die a natural death at the exhaustion of their age karma. They pervade throughout the whole universe. tdehmNgulss asNkhbhaagss viNdmaannN tu /

184. (Know) thou (that) their bodies (are equal to) an innumerable part of a cubic finger. Gross bodies need support but fine bodies need no support and exist everywhere in the universe) with nothing intervening between them.
Commentary. The physical size of such souls is so small that a grain of earth, a drop of water, a tiny flame, or a breath of wind, contains numberless embodied souls.
From the smallest undevelopable fine air bodied being up to the largest developable gross earth bodied being there are 42 stages of different sizes body. For there various degrees. See table Gathas 97 to 101.
The host souls, Nigoda vegetables which derive support from the host-individual-souled vegetables are all gross-bodied and not finebodied, which need no support.

185. By the operation of the vegetable body-making Karma, souls become vegetable-bodied. (They are individual) (Pratyeka) (i. e. one body one soul) or common (Samanya or Sadharana i. e, one body many souls). In. dividuals (are) host (Pratisthita with common Sadharana, parasites) or the other (i.e. non-host Apratisthita without common (Sadharana) parasites.)

Commentary. 1. Vegetables which grow from root are such as, ginger,
turmeric, 2. Vegetables which grow from a shoot, such as a rose-plant, 3. Vegetables, etc., etc., etc., from joint are such as sugar-cane. 4. Vegetables, from bulb Kanda are such as potatoes. 5.

117
Commentary.
Host-individual vegetables also in the beginning of their growth are non-host individual for an antar-muhurta. Then they become host untile they are so developed that the sinews and nerves appear on them, when they again become non-host individual.

The vegetables in which sinews, (shira), links, (Sandhi, and joints, ( Parva ), are unexposed, or which break clean (Samabhanga), which have no threads inside (Ahiruka) and which can grow from pieces are host bodies, while those that are reverse of these are individual (non-host). See (note to Gatha 73).
Commentary.
The term Sadharana in the Gatha, refers to Sapratishthta Pratyeka, host individual, souled vegetables.

199. Excepting the mobiles in the condition of birth, (Upapada) death bed and (Omniscient over flow) all the other mobiles do not exist out of the mobile channel. It has been said by the Conquerors.
GOMMATASARA.
Commentary.
An immobile soul out of the mobile channel, transmigrating to be born as a mobile, is during the passage, beginning from the first turn towards the mobile channel by operation of the mobile (body) making Karma, a mobile out of the mobile channel. This is Uppada, condition prior to birth.
. 
Samudghata is the emanation of soul spatial units from the body without wholly discarding it. Seven kinds of these soul emanations are recognised in Jain philosophy, (Dravya Sangraha S.B. J. Vol. I. p. 29, and Commentary to Gatha 543).
G
Maranantika-Samudghata (Death-bed-emanation) is the emanation, in some cases, of the soul spatial units shortly before death to the place where it is next going to incarnate. These soul units after touching their destination contract back to their former size and thereafter the soul leaves the body. If any mobile soul in the mobile channel is to take its next birth as an immobile outside the channel, and if before its death it performs the death-bed emanation, it naturally goes outside the mobile channel being a mobile.
Kevala-Samudghata (Omniscient overflow) is the emanation, when in some cases the soul of an omniscient being, (of course a mobile,) expands throughout the whole universe, and then contracts back. This is also a case in which a mobile soul goes outside the mobile channel.
B
Trasa Nadi (mobile channel) is the channel in the middle of the universe. It is fourteen Rajus high, one Raju long and one Raju broad. Mobiles are as a rule born within it alone.

200. The bodies of earth quadrates (earth, water, fire, air), of an omniscient being, (of a saint) in Aharaka (assimilative) emanation and (those) of celestials and hellish beings, do not support Nigoda bodies (Host souls.) The rest are with host souled-bodies.
Commentary. We learn from this Gatha that with the exception of the eight kinds of bodies specified above, all other bodies possess Nigoda-bodied souls.

201. The bodily figures of the earth quadrates (i. e. earth, water, fire, and air) are, (respectively speaking), (circular) like Masur grain, (round like) a drop of water, (cylindrical like) a bundle of needles, (and oblong like) a flag. The bodies of vegetables and mobile souls are of various sorts.
Commentary, The size of the body of an earth, water, fire, and air soul is the innumerable part of a cubic finger. Therefore they are not visible as separate entities. We see them only in a mass. Take a glass of fresh water. Every drop of it is a mass of water-bodied souls which are obviously invisible to us. Under a microscope a drop of water is seen to possess many minute animal-cule. These are not waterbodied souls. Water-bodied souls have water and that alone as the matter of their bodies. These animal-culae are two or more sensed beings which live in water.

1. Multiply 'Deyarashi' by itself as many times as the Viralana and resulting number should again be multiplied by itself as many times as its number is; such kind of multiplications should be done as many times as the number of the Shalaka Rashi. The result will give us the 1st step. 2. Take again Shalaka, Viralana, Deya, each equal to the num
found in the 1st step. The multiplication process should be repeated as in the previous step as many times as the number of the new Shalaka. This is the 2nd step.
3. The resulting number should be again dealt with as in the previous case. This would be the 3rd step.
4. This resulting number should again be similarly dealt with as many times as there are numbers in the present fourth shalaka minus the total number of the shalaka in the previous three steps.
Here in the first step, the number of innumerable spatial units of the universe should be taken to be Viralana, Deya, shalaka. The above process will give us the number of fire-bodied souls.
For finding out the number of earth-bodied souls, the number of fire-bodied souls should be divided by innumerable times the universal spatial units, and the quotient added to the number of fire-bodied souls.
For finding out the number of water-bodied souls we should add to the number of earth bodied souls, the quotient obtained by dividing the number of earth bodied by the innumerable universal spatial units. In the same manner the number of air-bodied souls should be ascertained.

Commentary.
The problem is like this:
If 16 twos multiplied by each other become 65536, what will 64 twos become by being multiplied by each other.
Here there are two sets of three figures. The first set is called the standard or 'Pramana Rashi.' In this all the three figures are known. Thus, in the above problem "two" is the Deya Rashi or the given basis, 16 is the Viralana or index number and 65536 is the 'Phala' or result.
The second set of the desired or Ichchha Rashi also consists of the same three number of which the 'Deya' is the same as in the standard or Pramana Rashi, and the Viralana or index is given, but the third figure, that is, the Phala or result is unknown and required to be obtained. Thus in the above problem, in the desired Rashi the Deya is 2, index is 64 and the result unknown and to be obtained. The formula, according to the gatha is as below:

verse, what will be the result in the terms of the spatial units of the universe, if 2 is raised to the power of the number of Halvings of the number of gross fire bodied beings.
The answer is clear. It is the number of the spatial units of the universe raised to the power of the quotient obtained by dividing the Halvings of the number of gross-bodied souls, by the Halvings of the number of spatial units of the universe.
Thus, the number of gross-fire-bodied souls is equal to innumerable into innumerable spatial units of the universe..
Similarly the number of other kinds can be obtained..

216. By the operation of the matter-maturing body (sub-class of the body making Karma) in the soul with mind, speech or body, that very capacity which is the cause of in-coming of the Karmas is vibration: (Yoga or vibratory activity of the soul).
Commentary.
Vibration (Jaga) is two kinds :
(1) Subjective vibratiqn (Bhaya Yoga) i. e., by capacity itself by which the matter of mind, speech or body is set in vibration..
(2) Objective vibration (Dravya yoga) i. e., the actual vibrating of the spatial units, (Pradesha) of soul..

Karma here means molecules of Karmic matter, also molecules of no-Karmic matter i. e. the molecules (vargana) of mind, speech, and aharaka and Electric (Tai jasa) matter..

6. It is long. This is true comparatively and not absolutely speaking. The thing is longer than one and shorter than another. This is an example of relative truth.
7. A man may say that he is "cooking rice" even when the rice is not being actually and is only ready for being cooked. This is an example of practical truth.
8. 'Indra can over turn Jambu-dvipa.' Indra may never do like this but he possesses the power to do it and it is a possibility and hence possible truth.
9. Injunction against commissions of sins as laid down in scriptures is scriptural truth. e. g., right belief, right knowledge, and right conduct lead to Liberation.

Note.That these ten parts of view have reference only to occassions where language may be ambiguous or capable of abuse or misrepresentation. Naturally the Syadvada philosophy must make a clear statement on such points; for example the word palanga means bed in Hindi, but it means a tiger in Persian; or pain in French, means bread, but in English it means trouble or suffering. If a French man asks an English man to give him "Pain" the pious son of Albion will certainly refuse to grant the request.

7. Is this a string or serpent. 8. I wish to be such. 9. Sound which can't be reduced to letters.
Sounds altered by souls2 sensed to irrational 5-sensed are letterless. So is the speech of an omniscient vibrating souls. It proceeds without volition from the Saint, but is understood by the audience as true, and authoritative.

227. The root cause of (true and neutral) (mind and speech verily) is the operation of developable and bodymaking Karmas. And the root cause of false and
mixed (mind and speech) is the obscuring (i.e., knowledge obscuring Karma).
Commentary. When one speaks or thinks of the truth, or what is neutral, neither true-nor-false, he exercise no special effort, and the speech or thought is the result of the operation of developable, and bodymaking Karmas.
But when one speaks or thinks what is false, or both true and false, it is intentional and is due to the operation of knowledge-obscuring Karma.
In all mind and speech vibrations the operation of developable and the body-making Karmas is invariably present. But in the above statement ; the predominant cause is referred to as the root-cause.

231. Know the aforesaid physical body (Auralika or Audarika) when ( it is) in combination (with the Karmic body) to be non-developable.
The vibration caused through such connection is physical mixed vibration, (Audarika mishra yoga). Commentary.
This vibration-activity takes place only when the soul is still non-developable for an antar-muhurta after its transmigratory passage (Vigrahagati). In developable condition this vibration is not possible ; there will then be only the physical-body-vibration.

Commentary.
This sort of body is found in celestials. Hellish beings also have got a kind of fluid body which is ugly and troublesome. It can also be transformed into many forms according to their desire. Hellish souls cannot make many bodies out of one, as is done by the celestials.

Commentary. This partial transformation, in size, is confined to the body . itself. The soul does not go beyond the trainsformed body; there
fore it is called Aprathak Vikriya i. e. inseparable transformation; but the 5-sensed rational human and subhumans i. e. all the beings in Bhoga-bhumi, enjoyment-region, and the Chakravartis, Lords of Bharat Kshetra can also transform their bodies into more than one and such transformation is called Prathak, i. e. separable. In this the soul extends continously into all the bodies and remains in the original body also.

Commentary. By means of the Aharaka body the saint flashes through space and obtains the sight or touches the feet of an Omniscient Lord or Saint with full scriptural knowledge, and it is enough to strengthen his self control and to remove his doubt.

242. The activities of fluid and assimilative bodies (are) not simultaneous in (the saint in the stage of) imperfect vows, and also of necessity at one time there is only one kind of vibration (out of the 15 kinds) in any mundane being at any time.
Commentary.
The simultaneous manifestation of 2 kinds of yoga is some-times possible. For example, when a man is repeating a prayer with his tongue but his mind is thinking of something else, the thought is the manifestation of the mind vibration, and the repetition of the prayer that of the speech vibration. But this dual vibration is only seemingly so. At one instant there can only be one kind of vibration. The explanation would be easy to understand if we pause to try to comprehend the extremely short duration of an instant (samaya). There are innumerable instants in a wink, and what figure is meant by even the minimum innumerable, will be evident from the Appendix to Jaina Gem Dictionary. Thus the possible change of the kind of vibration from instant to instant is quicker than lightning. In one flash of lightning there can be millions, trillions, quintillions, or even more changes of vibration from mind to speech and from speech to mind. So, even to a most self-analytical and self-absorbing man this transition from vibration to vibration would be almost impossible to perceive. Then there is another thing to consider. The vibration (yoga) is that power of the soul which at the operation of the body-making karma becomes the cause of the inflow of karmic and non-karmic matter in the soul's environments. This vibration once started can last for one maximum antara-muhurta i. e. for 48 minutes minus one instant. Before this maximum or a smaller duration of one kind of vibration has expired, another kind of vibration may set in. This also gives rise to the phenomenon of an apparent duality of vibrations. Thus the vibration may be only mind vibration, and the speech activity, i. e. repeating the prayer may be due merely to the momentun (sanskara) of the preceding speech vibration, just as a potter's wheel continues to revolve for sometime even after he ceases to move it by his stick.

244. The four bodies produced by the operation of the physical, fluid, assimilative and electric (Taijasa) body sub-classes of the body-making karma, are no-karma or quasi-karma, and the karmic (body produced by the operation of karmic body-sub-class of body-making karma) is the karma proper (i. e, the interwoven texture of the matter of the eight kinds of karmas.)
Commentary. Whenever a body-karma operates to set in activity the vibration power of the soul, material molecules suitable to the then bodies of the soul are drawn in i. e. attracted to inflow into the soul. The least number of bodies that a soul has is two, karmic and electrio bodies, in transmigratory passage. So that at every instant the soul is drawing in molecules both of karmic (karmana vargana ) and quasi-karmic matter of the electric body (taijasa-vargana) in transmigratory passage. When not in transmigratory passage the soul has in addition to the karmic and electric bodies the physical or fluid body also which is made of assimilative molecules (aharaka vargana). If the soul has more than one sense, it has speech also, and takes in the vocal molecules (Bhasha vargana) also. As a five sensed rational being, it assimilates mind molecules (mano-vargana) also. So that an ordinary human being at every instant of time is drawing in these 5 varganas.

Therefore the matter of the electric body must be very much finer than that of the physical body. Perhaps it may be better understood by a comparison of the wave-lengths of heat and electricity. The electric waves are more numerous and shorter (that is, finer) than those of heat. So for the same length in space, we have many more and much finer wave-lengths for electricity than for heat.

The atoms of Karmic and quasi-Karmic matter flow into the soul at every instant, but only a few of them are shed at each instant, the others remain in bondage. Naturally at the moment of death the number of these unshed and inflowed atoms would be the maximum if the soul had the highest vibratory activity, etc.

254. In each instant only one unit of bondage (Samaya Prabaddha) is bound and comes into operation. In the last (instant of the duration of any unit of bondage) (the number of) existing atoms (Satva) is one and a half times the number of Gunahanis multiplied by that unit of bondage.
Commentary. Gunahani here means Gunahani ayama. In the example in the note below it is evident that the number of molecules shed in the first 48 instants will respectively, be:
(1) 512, 480, 448, 416, 384, 352, 320, 288. (2) 256, 240,224, 208, 192, 176, 160, 144. (3) 128, 120, 112, 104, 96, 88,80, 72. (4) 64, 60, 56, 52,48, 44, 40, 36. (5) 32, 30, 28, 26, 24, 22, 20, 18. (6) 16, 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9.
From this it is easy to calculate that at the last instant the un shed molecules will be 71,304, and it is just a little less than 11 Gunahani Ayama times of the unit of bondage, i. e. 1} x 8 x 6300 -75600.

255. But the duration of the unit of bondage (Samaya Prabaddha), (which is bound to the two bodies physical and fluid, is) the total length of one's age minus its length already exhausted. In the last (instant of life) the number of existing molecules is one and a half times of Gunahani and (all of them shed by) operation. (This is necessarily so as in vigraha Gati, the soul cannot have the physical, fluid, or assimilative bodies).

Commentary.
guafa Gunahani, (G) is the number of terms of a series the sum of which is the number of molecules of a unit of Bondage, (M.U.B.) and each term in which is half of the term immediately preceding it. Gunahani-a-yam, (G. A.) is the number of instants (Samayas) in one Gunahani.
naan gunnhaani nana gunahani is the group of gunahanis in one Unit of Bondage.
the number of gunahanis in one Unit of Bondage.
Duration of Bondage (S). Thus gunahani-ayama= number of gunahanis
Anyonya-bhyasta-rashi - 2 raised to the power of
E. G. if 48 samayas is the duration of Unit of Bondage, and 6 is the number of gunahanis, then gunahani-ayama= 8.
Here nana-gunahani the group of 6 gunahanis.
Anyonya bhyastarashi here=25-64.
This minus one, being the divisor of the number of a Unit of Bondage gives us the term of the series.
E. G. if a Unit of Bondage have 6300 molecules, then the last term is
6300 64-1
-100.
Thus the series of 6 gunahanis here is.
3200+ 1600+ 800+ 400+ 200+ 100-6300.
1600
800
400
200

In the example given above, the soul which binds in one instant 6300 molecules, of a duration of 48 samayas and of 6 gunahanis, will shed 3200 molecules in the 1st 8 samayas.

Nishekahara (N 2G. A.) is always double the number of
gunahani ayama. Thus in the above example nishekahara is double of 8-16.
""
Chaya (C) is the regular arithmetic difference between any consecutive two of the terms of the series of a gunahani. Chaya is the molecules of a gunahani divided by
nishekahara + No. of gunahani ayama + 1

The molecules shed in the 1st instant (F). in any gunahani - F= Chaya ~ Nishekahara. 4M

* 35+G
1st term 2 gunahani ayama
Thus in the 4th 8 - samayas in the above example, 400 molecules are shed. We want to find out how many molecules are shed in the 1st samaya, and by how many molecules the shedding becomes less and less in each succeeding samaya.
To find out the molecules shed in the 1st samaya, i. e., F, we apply the formula.
4M 4x400_4x400 1600

C +1

To find out the chaya, (C) we employ the formula

Therefore the number of molecules shed in the 4th set of 8 samayas will be 64, 60, 56, 52, 48, 44, 40 and 36-400.
If in one instant, the soul binds 6300 molecules of a duration of 48 instants then they are shed as follows:

And the four speech vibrations (are) successively numerable times of that (total of four).
Commentary. Let 2 be the Sankhyata in this Gatha and let t be the instants of true-mind-vibration. Then we get t, 2t, 4t, 8t, as time for the 4 mind-vibrations respectively. Their total is 15t. The times of the four speech-vibrations are 30t, 60t, 120t, and 240t respectively. All these periods individually, and all the 8 or any number of them, collectively, amount to an antar-muhurta, which varies from 1Avali and 1 Samaya, to 48 minutes minus one Samaya.

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
Let the total number of souls for all three vibrations be equal to 21840. According to the above Gatha, t, the number of souls with true-mind-vibrations is 21840-1365-16.
And the numbers of souls corresponding to the above 9 classes of vibrations are, respectively, 16, 32, 64, 128, 480, 960, 1920, 3840, 14400 aggregating 21840.
From the above we can deduce the following rule. The number of souls for any 2 of the above 9 classes of vibration is in direct proportion to the number of instants in their durations.

The use of the last word (Kamaso) in the Gatha shows that the author has based his account upon Dhavala, one of the most ancient and authoritative Jain texts, of which, so far as at present known, only one copy exists in the library of Sri Parasvanath Digambara Jain temple at Mulabidri (South Canara).

Commentary. Continuous birth-time means that continuation of instants in which some or other of the peripatetics is born. After this there is a break of at least one instant in which none is born anywhere. But this interval of non-birth never exceeds 12 Muhurtas or 9 hours and 36 minutes.

The number of stellars is the basic area of universe i.e., 49 square (Rajus) divided by a square finger multiplied by Pannatthi viz. 49 square Rajus 128 (say), and let Sankhyata be equal to 2. 65536 sq. fingers Then their numbers, respectively, would be 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2

* 282. They (the Acharyas) call (Passion) as Kashaya, (because) it ploughs (Krishati) the field of soul's Karmas, extending to (eternal and infinite) length of mundane existence, and productive of huge crop of pleasure and pain.
Commentary. Passion is the root of the continuance of our mundane existence. Tho whole extent of mundane existence is the long long field which it ploughs. Its crops are the innumerable pleasures and pains with which every mundane form of life is always saturated. This great and incessant plougher is Passion, (Kashaya), so called because it brings about the ploughing (Karshana) of the field of Karmas.
So they call it. This connotes two things, (1) that the account of the passions here is based upon the earlier treatise Maha-Dhavala which in its second part (Kashaya Prabhrita) deals with passions. The age of Maha-Dhavala which is the last of the trilogy, Dhavala, Jai Dhavala and Maha-Dhavala, and of which only one copy exists in Southern India in the library of the Parshvanath Temple at Mudabidri, District South Canara, is very old indeed. This great commentary was put together by the saintly disciples of Dharasenacharya who flourished about 600 or 700 years after Lord Mahayira. Thus he was a near successor to Umasvami, author of the marvellous Tattvartha-sutra, and the most illustrious pupil of Sri Kunda-kunda-charya who is daily mentioned in thousands of Jain temples as the carrier onward of the unadulterated, authentic and authoritative tradition of the Jain Doctrines of the great Gana. dharas, (apostles) who learnt the whole, unchangeable, and eternal truth at the feet of the last Lord Mahavira Himself. The saint Nemi-chandra is constantly anxious to advert to this unbroken continuity of Jaina tradition.
The second connotation of the phrase "so they call it" is this. The author disclaims any share in the origination of what he is giving. He tells us that he is merely repeating what has been taught for ages and ages, without any addition or alteration on his part.

smyktvdesh sklcritrythaakhyaat crnnprinnaamaan  /  maufa 31 90191: !guieandaeainifar: || 253 || 283. Or (those which) destroy (Kashanti) the thoughtactivities of right belief (Samyaktva), conduct (Charitra). with partial (Desha,) and full (Sakala, vows), (and) ideal conduct (Yathakhyata charitra), (are) the passions (Kashayas). (Their) number (is) four, sixteen, and innumerable (times the spatial units in) the universe.
163
Commentary.
The four passions are: Anger (Krodha,) Pride (Mana), Deceit (Maya) and Greed (Lobha).
Each of these is of 4 kinds: error feeding, Anantanu-bandhi which destroys right belief; partial-vow-preventing, Apratyakhyanavarana, which destroys such right conduct as consists in the observance of partial vows; total-vow-preventing, Pratyak hanavarana which destroys such right. conduct as consists in the observance of full vows; and perfect-right-conduct preventing, Sanjvalana, which destroys ideal right conduct.

Thus there are 16 kinds of the 4 passions,
The error-feeding-passions keep us in the first spiritual stage of wrong belief Mithyatva or tend to bring us down from 4th to the 2nd stage. Partial-vow-preventing passions keep us in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th stages. Total-vow-preventing-passions keep us in the 5th stage. Perfect-right-conduct-preventing-passions keep us in the 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and 10th stages, and bring us back from the 11th. In the 11th, 12th, 13th, and 14th stages there are no passions, except in the 11th stage where they are in a quiescent form, and bring the soul back to the 10th and lower stages.
In this and the last Gatha, two etymological derivations of the word Kashaya are given. In the first, it is derived from Krisha to plough, because it ploughs the field of Karmas of which the soul reaps the fruit. In this it is derived from Kasha to destroy, because it destroys the right-belief and right conduct of the soul.

284. Anger is (deep) like a furrow in stone, or in earth; or (mild like) a line drawn in dust, or water. (They are) respectively the producers of the hellish, sub-human, human and celestial conditions of existence.
Commentary. The four illustrations in the Gatha represent the intensity of the feeling of anger and the more or less lasting impression which it produces. They do not correspond to the 4 sub-classes, errorfeeding etc., of anger because all the four degrees may appear in each one of the 16 classes. These four degrees have been called Very intense, intense, mild, very mild (Tibra-tara, Tibra, Manda, Mand-tara) from the point of view of the degree of intensity connoted: They are also called maximum, Utkrishta ; non-maximum Anutkrishta ; non-minimum, Ajaghanya ; minimum, Jaghanya.

This shows that greed i.e., a desire for long and many enjoy. ments is common among the celestials; and anger is very rare. Similarly, it would be found that anger is most common and greed the rarest of their passions, among hellish beings.

298. (The number of) humans and sub-humans with greed, deceit, anger and pride (is found by treating their total number minus the numbers of passionless) ; like 2 sensed etc., beings (in Gatha 179), by dividing by an innumerable part of a wink (Avali). Or (it) may be got from the instants of their duration.
Commentary, Let us illustrate how to find out the comparative number of humans affected by each passion at one instant. Let the number of total humans be
100500 y passion-less humans be ... 500 Then the number of humans with passion is ... 100000 * Let the innumerable part of an avali be 10. Divide 100000 by 10=10000. And 100000 - 10000=90000.
Divide 90000 equally into 4 parts, and let the quotient, 22,500, be allotted to greed, deceit, anger and pride, each. Now divide the remaining one part, 10000, again by 10, the innumerable part of an Avali. We get 1000.
10000 -1000-9000. This should be added to the above allotment. And we find the number of humans with greed = 22500 + 9001 = 31500.
Again divide the balance 1000, by 10. We get 100.
Then 1000-100 - 900. This should be added to the second class. Then humans with deceit would be 22500 + 900=23400.
Again divide 100 by 10 - 10. 100-10=90 should be added to third class. Then humans with anger will be 22500+ 90-22590.
The balance 10 should be added to 4th class, then humans with ride will be 22500+10=22510.

It shows that if there are 100000 humans with passions, the proportion will be like this:

pride -22510

Similarly we can get number of sub-humans. The second process of finding out the comparative numbers as given in the gatha is illustrated as follows:
"
Let the instants of an Antara-muhurta of duration of all the passions be 10000 and the total number of passionate humans be 100000, and the innumerable part of an Avali 10.
""
Then divide 10000 instants by 10-1000. Then 10000-1000-9000. This should be divided equally into the four passions, greed, deceit, anger and pride, i. e. 9000/4-2250. The balance 1000 should again be divided by 10, and we get 100. Then 1000-100-900, should be added to greed. Then it will be = 2250+900=3150.
""
The balance 100 should again be divided by 10. We get 10. 100-10-90. This should be added to deceit, we have then 2250+90-2340.
""
The balance 10 should again be divided by 10. We get 1. 10-1-9. This should be added to anger, we have then 2250+9-2259.
39
The remaining 1 should be added to the pride=2250+1=2251. The instants of 4 passions will be 3150 +2340 +2259 +2251-10000. Now we should find out the number of humans by rule of three. In 10000 instants there are 100000 humans, how many will there be in 3150, 2340,2259,2251, instants.

By the operation of the mixed (Mishra, rightand-wrong-belief of sub-class of right-helief-deluding Karma, Darshan Moha) the 3 kinds of (right) knowledge (are) themselves mixed up with 3 (kinds of) wrong knowledge. Mental knowledge has been predicated of (saints from the 6th to 12th stage with special (self) control.
Commentary. The first stage of wrong belief (Mithyatva) is mentioned in Gatha 301, as also the second stage of downfall (sasadana) in which there is the operation of error-feeding-passions. The 3rd, mixed stage is mentioned here. The 4th stage is where right knowledge begins. In the 4th and 5th stages all the three kinds of right knowledge can be found. Mental knowledge is found only in 6th stage and onward. The first four kinds of right knowledge may thus, be found from 6th to 12th stage. Perfect-knowledge is found only in the 13th and 14th stages, and in the liberated souls. visjNtkuuddpNjrbNdhaadisu vinnuveskrnnenn  /

Right scriptural knowledge is that which keeps one engaged in the thinking and writing of truth leading to liberation of the soul ; and that which appertains to temporal matters, and onesided views is called wrong scriptural knowledge. From this spiritual point of view, all literature and teaching of matters relating to the commission, as well as the prevention and detection of offences, literature of fiction, and impossible stories, propagation of doctrines which cannot be established by logical arguments, and all light, vulgar, and obscene literature are all instances of wrong scriptural knowledge.

Commentary. In this and the 2 preceding Gathas, three kinds of wrong knowledge are described. The Gathas are merely illustrative. They roughly exemplify rather than define and distinguish 3 kinds of wrong knowledge. The point to grasp is this, that wrong knowledge is certainly as much knowledge as right knowledge. The method and means of acquisition of both are the same. The character of the scope and limitations is the same. But the result is totally different in the 2 cases. In one it is knowledge of things as they are; in the others it is not so, it is perverse, contrary or otherwise distorted. This is called wrong knowledge. For example, take the teachings of Mahabharata and Ramayana. The outlines of the story are certainly true. But their description is some times so grotescue that it must be called perversion of truth, for instance no one can believe in the literal truth of an army of monkeys being marched against the human hosts of the proud Lord of Lanka. If the reader believes such incidents to be literally true, he would certainly have wrong scriptural knowledge.

Commentary.
Sensitive knowledge is knowledge derived through the five senses and the mind. Each one of these may be perception, conception, judgment or retention. This gives 24 sub-clauses of deter - minable objects. Indeterminate perception (Vyanjanavagraha) is only by means of senses of touch, taste, smell and hearing. Thus there are 28. Each one of these may be of the 12 kinds given in the above Gatha. Thus there are 336 classes of Sensitive knowledge.

Commentary.
Hidden or (anihsrita), as the name implies, is the hidden subject matter of sensitive knowledge. It is the perception etc., of the whole from a part, or of one thing from a part or whole of another. It should be noted that the subject matter here is always hidden. It is a kind of inference. It is not the knowledge of the thing known. It is rather a knowledge of something else from this knowledge. For example, when an elephant is standing submerged in water, when I look at it and I have direct knowledge only of the tip of its living trunk, I have an inferential perception of the whole body of the elephant, although I do not see it. Or when I see a beautiful face or an ox, I think of the lovely moon or the animal cow. This reminiscence of similar qualities of beauty and cow, is knowledge of something hidden (anihsrita. )

. Commentary, Shruta, literally means that which is heard (shru, to hear). Scriptural knowledge is of two kinds: -
1. Lettered or verbal (Aksharatmaka), 2. Letterless or nonverbal (Anakshratmaka).
Verbal scriptural knowledge is derived from words which are composed of letters (Akshara) spoken or written; as when the eye sees the written word or the ear hears the spoken word 'SOUL,' the seeing and hearing gives us merely sensitive knowledge. What more we think about the meaning, and connotation of the word 'SOUL'is scriptural knowledge. It is called verbal scriptural know

ledge; because it is derived from our sensitive knowledge of the word Soul.
Non-verbal scriptural knowledge is derived from all kinds of sensitive knowledge, except those kinds which can be reduced to words, written or spoken. E. G., you feel cold air; the knowledge of coldness is sensitive knowledge by means of touch of the skin. If you do not like it, that is unpleasant, it is (non-verbal) scriptu knowledge. It is derived from your knowledge of feeling of cold, which cannot be reduced to a mere word, written or spoken.
Verbal scriptural knowledge is possible only in rational beings. All the irrationals (asamjni) have only non-verbal scriptural knowledge.
Their sensitive knowledge is confined to perception (Avagraha) by the 5 senses, and indeterminate preception by all, except the eye. So, the irrationals have got only 9 out of 28 divisions.
The rationals (Sanjni) have the non-verbal scriptural knowledge also. Verbal scriptural knowledge (Aksharatmaka) is also called Shabda Jnana or Shabdaja produced by words. Non-verbal (Anakshratmaka) scriptural knowledge is also called Linga-Jnana or Lingaja, produced by signs.

Commentary. 6 fold increase - (1) Increase by an infinite part (Ananta Bhaga vriddhi) i. e. by adding an infinite part to the original.

5. Increase by innumerable times (Asankhyata Guna Vriddhi.) (6) Increase by infinite times (Ananta Guna Vriddhi .)
The 6th term-expression { (((((2)*)+-)+-) 2)= } 2 this is called Ek - atthi. In this series the basic number is 2, and the index is also 2, each term is the square of the index of the immediately preceding term. Therefore it is called Dvirupavarga Dhara, because all the figures in it are 2 and the indices grow in a series of two to the power two, etc. The number of twos in any term is one more than the number of the term in the series and the number of the twos in the index is the number of the term itself. Thus the fourth term has 4 twos as its index and 5 twos in all. It is called Pannatthi. It is equal to 65536.
The 5th term in the series has 5 twos in index and 6 in all. It is called Vadala. It is equal to (65536)*.
The 6th term has 6 twos in index and 7 in all. It is called Ekatthi is equal to ( 65536 ) 4. The number of different unrepeated letters (Apunurukta Akshara) and their unrepeated combinations employed in the whole of the scriptures is (Ekatthi) - 1 { (65536 ) - 1 ) -184,467,440,737,095,516,15.
Total of the repeated letters is obviously very much more than the above number.

The meaning is that this is the minimum kind of knowledge, almost the point where knowledge entirely vanishes. In other words, this is the point from which the knowledge begins. Naturally this must be immune from the activity of Knowledge obscuring Karma.

821. (This Paryaya minimum, non-verbal, scriptural knowledge) is only in fine (completely) undevelopable common soul, (Nigoda) during the first turning, out of the three (maximum possible) turnings (in transmigration), to its last completely undevelopable (incarnation) after having been born in all its possible (mean births, 6012-minus this last one.)
Commentary. This is so, because continuous wanderings in the same absolutely lowest form of existence cause the greatest pain, and generate the most instense kind of conation and knowledge-obscuring-Karmas. By the operation of such Karmas, when the soul moves towards the last of its mean births, it has absolutely the lowest degree of conation and of sensitive and non-verbal scriptural knowledge.

326. The preceding increase having been repeated (as many times as there are spatial units) in an innumerable part of a (linear, finger, the next increase takes place one time. Certainly this is done again and again till the last increase, (i. e. every one of 6 increases is repeated an innumerable part of a linear finger before the next one is taken).
Commentary. Six fold increase may best be explained by an illustrative statementLet infinite be represented by
innumerable ,, numerable
, , 2. and let the first figure subject to increase be 48.
(1) Infinite part increase = 48 + 4 = 48 + 6 = 54. (2) Innumerable,
=- 54.51-54 + 18 - 72, (3) Numerable ,
= 72+ 7 = 72 + 36-108. (4) Numerable fold
= 108 108 x 2-108 + 216 -324, (5) Innumerable fold
= 324 + 324 x 3-324 +972-1296. (6) Infinite fold , , -1296 + 1296 x 8 1295 + 10368 - 11664.
Thus if all the 6 kinds of increase take effect once on 48, it would amount to 11664.
Now let us see how this six-fold increase takes effect as stated in gatha 326, on the minimum scriptural knowledge called paryaya knowledge, possessed by a non-developablo tine Nigoda vegetable vide gatha 321.
The infinite part increase takes place as many times as there are spatial units in an innumerable part of a linear finger (Suchiangula), thereafter the innumerable part increase takes place only once. And again the infinite part increase takes place as many times as there are spatial units in an innumerable part of a linear finger, after which, the innumerable part increase shall take place a second time. Then again the infinite part increase shall happen as before, and the innumerable part increase once again. Proceeding in this manner the innumerable part increase should take place as many times as there are spatial units in an innumerable part of a linear finger. Then again the infinite part increase should take place as many times as there are spatial units in an innumerable part of a linear finger. There-after the numerable part increase

shall take place once, and the process of infinite part increase and innumerable part increase repeated as above; there-after the numerical part shall take place the second time. The process should be repeated again and again to complete the numerical part increase as many times as there are spatial units in an innumerable part of a linear finger. The process of infinite part increase and innumerable part increase should again be exhausted, the same number of times as above. Then again infinite part increase shall take place as many times as there are spatial units etc., etc., etc. Thereafter the numerable fold increase shall once take place. The whole of the preceding process from the very beginning being repeated we shall have numerable fold increase a second time.
The repetition of the process should be done as many times as there are spatial units in an innumerable part of a linear finger and then we shall have the numerable fold increase the same number of times. Now again the process from the very beginning should be repeated to complete the innumerable part increase, and numerable part increase and again the innumerable part increase the same number of times, then infinite part increase should be done the same number of times, afterwards once innumerable fold increase should be done. In order to complete this innumerable fold increase the same number of times, the same process from the very beginning should be repeated the same number of times.
Now-again the process preceding the first innumerable fold increase should be repeated.
Then after making infinite part increase as many times as there are spatial units in innumerable part of a linear finger, infinite fold increase should be done once.
The number thus gained will be the last figure of the six-fold increase. This figure should be taken as the first figure for calculating the second six-fold increase. Such six-fold increases effected innumerable times, the innumerable spatial units of the universe represent the extent of Paryaya-Samasa-knowledge.
For further details see Sanskrit commentary of Gommatsara. The following table will show how the repetition of increases is done. U refers to infinite part. 4 to innumerable part, 5 to numerable part, 6 to numerable fold, 7 to innumerable fold and 8 to infinite fold. The recurrence of any one or more of these figures means their repetition as many times as there are spatial units in an innumerable part of a linear finger.

And the last is (infinite part increase) (Ananta bhaga vriddhi, the figure U (urvanka). The minimum knowledge (Paryaya Jnana) is also) the figure 8 (Ashtanka, i. e., infinite fold) as the omniscient has seen.
Commentary. In the six-fold increase, the last increase is the infinite-fold, which becomes the first commencing figure of the next six-fold increase. Then the last figure of any six-fold increase will be the infinite part increase preceding the infinite-fold increase infinite part increase is called Urvanka. The minimum knowledge is also called 8 Ashtanka because it is infinite fold of the measure of degrees (Avibhaga Pratichheda) in the attribute of individuality (aguru-laghu).

Commentary. _The statement in Gathas 329 and 330 may be illustrated as follows: -
Let Kandaka be represented by 2.
Then the total number of increases in one set of six-fold increases will be (2+1) x (2 + 1)* = 9x 27%D 243 (vide gatha 330).

333. Verbal scriptural knowledge (Arthakshara) divided (by what is got) after the last U, multiplied by (what is got) after the last U, is the verbal scriptural knowledge. This is said by the Conquerors.
Commentary. Verbal scriptural knowledge is that which is got after an infinite fold increase (Ananta-guna-vriddhi) in the result of the last . U, increase i. e. increase by infinite part. This divided by (Ekatthi - 1) is the minimum verbal scriptural knowledge (Akshara Jnana, knowledge of a letter).

The infinite degrees (Avibhaga Pratichheda) contained in one letter-knowledge divided by the degrees (Avibhaga Pratichheda) of U, the highest figure of Paryaya-Samasa-knowledge is the infinite by which we have to multiply the Paryaya-Samasa-knowledge to obtain verbal scriptural knowledge. This infinite is different from the infinite in the six-fold increases heretofore.
Akshara is of three kinds:(i) Capacity of possessing (minimum) verbal scriptural know
ledge, produced by the destruction-subsidence of the scriptural-knowledge obscuring-Karma. It is called letter facul
ty, Labdhyakshara. (ii) Sound produced by means of the vocal organs, lips, teeth,
tongue, palate, throat, etc., are called letter sounds,
Nirvritti Akshara. (iii) Representation of sounds by letters is the letter-representa

Commentary. Foot or Pada is of 3 kinds: -
(1) Arthapada meaning foot a combination of letters which conveys some meaning as "bring fire" "Agnim Anaya."
(2) Pramana-pada, measure-foot, a fixed number of letters or syllables necessary for a particular kind of combination in prose or poetry, such as, " I bow to the Lord Mahavira" (namah Shri-varddha Manaya) Here the foot, consists of letters, forming a fourth part of verse of the metre called Anushtupa.
(3) Maddhyama-Pada-middle-foot. It comprises 1634,83,07,888 letters as said in the above gatha. This pada is used as a unit of measurement, in describing the contents of the different Angas or parts of the scriptural-knowledge in gatha 350 and those which follow.

379. We do not know the length, breadth and height in space of minimum visual (knowledge) separately. But its cubic volume (Samikarana) is the extent in space of minimum (Visual knowledge.)
Commentary. The extent in space of the body of a fine completely undevelopable common soul in the 3rd instant from its birth being the absolute minimum cannot be reduced to its length, breadth, and height, in any linear measure which can be conprehended by the human mind. This is what is meant in the gatha.
Otherwise there are innumerable spatial-units even in the space occupied by this body, and each one of them is perfectly plain to the all-knowledge of the Omniscient.

The minimum spatial extent (Kshetra) of visual (knowledge) is (measured) by Utseda angula, because (its measure is) the extent of the space occupied by (the body of the) fine (completely undevelopalle common soul in 3rd instant of its birth.) Beyond this (the measure is by) (Pramana-angula) (equal to 500 Utsedangula),

 Commentary. For example, if we have to find the extent and time of the fifth division of high visual knowledge, then the sum of series will be-1+2+3+4+5-15. Then the extent and time of maximum partial visual knowledge multiplied 15 times by the innumerable part of an avali, will give the extent and time of the 5th division of high visual knowledge.

halvings of the desired number (Ichchita-rashi) by the number of halvings of the given number (Deya-Rashi) is equal to the desired number (Ichchita rashi).
Commentary. Suppose the desired number is 256 and given number is 16. Then halvings of 256 are 8 and those of 16 are 4. 8 divided by 4 = 2..  /  And 16x16= 256 the desired number. dinnnncchedennv hdlogcchedenn pddhnne bhjide /  lddhmidloggunnnnN prmaavhicrimgunngaaro  //  421 //  degcchedenaavhitlokccheden pddhne bhjite  /  lbdhmitlokgunnnN prmaavdhicrmgunnkaarH  //  421  // 
421. Divide the number of halvings of the (spatial units of the) universe by the number of halvings of (an innumerable part of an Avali) Deya. By the quotient divide the sum of the series (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 etc., upto the term represented by the desired division) Multiply the (spatial units of the) universe, by themselves as many times as the number of this last quotient (We then) get the multiplier for any division of high Visual knowledge. (The same process will apply in respect of every division) till the last one.
Commentary. Let the spatial units of universe be 256, and the innumerable part of an avali be 16. We have to find out the multiplier of its third division. The halvings of 256 are 8; and those of 16 are 4. Now 8:4 2 . The sum of series 1+2+3-6. And 6:-2-3. Therefore 2563 is the number by which the extent and time of maximum partial visual knowledge will be multiplied to gain the extent and time of third division of high visual knowledge.

will see this fact. Also if the man is thinking of establishing a library of the same pattern as the Bodleian, but has forgotten the details; simple knowledge will see the present desire and also the forgotten details. There is no historic record of a particular action done by Lord Mahavira, when preparing for renunciation. Complex knowledge can even to-day see his mental activity corresponding to that preparation. Simple knowledge cannot see this fact because there is nothing in the mind of another, at the present moment to link up that past with the present.

489. That by which the soul, stains himself with, or, makes his own the demerit (Papa) and merit (Punya) is the (thought) paint (Bhava Leshya). So it has been described by the knowers of the attributes of Paint (Leshya).
Commentary, Thought-paint seems to be a better expression than thought colour. Colour is a part of the thing itself. Paint is something imposed from without. The soul is immaterial (Amurti), and colour (Varna) is an essential and peculiar attribute of Matter (sprth rs gess vrnnvntH pudglaaH)
Thought-colour and thought forms are familiar to all students of Theosophy. See " Thought Forms by Mrs. Besant and C. W. Leadbeater 1905." There are differences in arrangement, and in description also here and there. The definite, and unbridgeable demarcation between living and non-living, which characterises Jainism so beautifully is sometimes lost sight of. The soul, i.e., consciousness and also every modification of this consciousness, i.e. thought-activity, is immaterial and colourless. Colour is in matter; and matter certainly acts and reacts upon the soul by Inflow, Bondage, etc., due to Passions and Vibrations.

490. The vibratory activity (of the soul) coloured by the operation of the passion (sub-class of deluding karma) is thought-paint ( Leshya). Therefore 4 ( kinds of) bondage has been said to be the effect of these two.
Commentary.
Vibratory activity (Yoga) determines the nature of Karmic matter (Prakriti) and the number of Karmic molecules (Pradesha) which bind the soul. The passions (kashaya) by their intensity, etc. determine the duration of bondage (Sthiti), and strong or mild character of fruition (Anubhaga.)

Commentary. Bad passion-places correspond to the three bad thought-paints, black, blue and grey, and good passion-places to yellow, pink, and white. The total number of places being divided by a smaller kind of innumerable universe spatial units, give the number of
d places, and these are themselves innumerable universe units. The huge balance is the number of bad and painful places.

And in each, (the decrease and increase) is 6-fold (as given in the chapter of knowledge in gatha 325 and the following).
Commentary. The operation places of passions (Kashay-adhya-vasaya-sthana) are equal to innumerable times the innumerable spatial units of universe.
Let this be equal to 1; and let the divisor for it=innumerable universe-9.
Then good thought-paints are 1:9- " bad , , , the rest-1-1

503. And by the increase of purity the soul (modifies itself or progresses through the three good ( i. e), yellow, pink and white (thought paints) in (their) minimum etc. (i. e., medium and maximum) parts, (and) by the decrease, (it) is the reverse.

504. Change (Sankramana) is of (two kinds, i.e.), in its own-place (Svasthana or from its own place to) other place (Parasthana), i.e., in the same or other thought-paint). In the increases of black and white (thought-paints, the change is only) in its own place (Svasthana ) ; and in their decreases (it is) of both kinds (i. e., own place Svasthana) and other place (Parasthana). (And) of the other (thought paints) also (it is) of both kinds.

505. In thought-paints, (the change) in their own. place (Svasthana) from the maximum (is) by minimum decrease (i. e., decrease by infinite part, Ananta Bhaga Hani) and (the change) from the minimum (is) by minimum increase, (i. e., increase by infinite part, Ananta Bhaga Vriddhi). (And) necessarily, (the change) from the minimum (of every thought paint) to other place (Parasthana) is by decrease infinite fold, Ananta Guna Hani).
Commentary. Out of six Leshyas, three are bad and three are good. Black, blue and grey are bad. The thought activity in black is the worst. Pale, pink, and white are good. The best thought activity is in white. In each thought-paint, the change in degrees, from the highest impurity or purity to the lowest impurity or purity, respectively, will be by infinite part. But when it is to be transformed into its next thought-paint of low impurity or purity the change will be by infinite fold decrease. The highest impurity in black-thought-paint having decreased to its last decrease of infinite part, is at its lowest point of impurity. But the minimum impurity in the next, namely the blue thought-paint, will be by infinite fold decrease in the lowest impurity of black-thought-paint. And so on.

- Commentary. Decrease of impurity or purity from black to grey or from white to pale respectively will be by 6 fold-decrease, and increase of impurity or purity from grey to black or from pale to white will also be by 6 fold increase. The increase and decrease both are (1) infinite part (2) innumerable part, (3) numerable part (4) numerable fold, (5) innumerable fold and (6) infinite fold. The process has been explained in the chapter on knowledge.

507-508. Six men, travellers, are lost in the central part of a forest. Seeing a fruit-laden tree they (severally) think of eating the fruits, by uprooting (the tree), by cut. ting its trunk, by (cutting) the branches, by cutting the minor branches, by plucking (the fruits), by (picking) the fallen (fruits from the ground). Their speech (which represents the six kinds of activity) in the mind is the (result or) action (of the respective thought-paints).
_ Commentary. The person who wants to uproot the whole tree is actuated by black-thought-paint. The one who keeps the root, but wishes to cut it down from the trunk is of blue-paint. He who wishes to cut the large branches is of grey-thought-paint. The remaining three persons do not want to destroy the generating parts of the tree, but they are indifferent in having their object fulfilled as harmlessly as possible. The person who wants to pick up the fallen fruits

between the most intense black and the most mild white, namely from black to blue 6 places decrease.
blue to grey 6 >> white to pink 6 ,, pink to yellow 6
These 24+2 said above are the 26 parts of thought-paints. Out of these, 8 parts are for age-bondage only. In the chapter on passions we have given a diagram to Gatha 295. It shows that the force of passions is classified into four kinds (1) Intenser like stone (2) intense like earth, (3) mild like dust, (4) milder like water.
In the first stone-kind, there are 2 divisions, in the last or most intense of black no age Karma is bound, but in the next division. which is a kind of medium intense black, hellish age only is bound. In the second earth-kind, there are medium conditions of all the six thought-paints; bondage of all the four kinds of age Karma is possible there. In the third dust-kind, also there are 6 thoughtpaints of medium mild kind, where also all the four age Karmas * are bound: but in places where black thought paint is absent, there is such a mild degree of five other thought-paints, that only celestial age-Karma is bound. Its last portions do not bind any age Karma. The fourth, water kind is the mildest and cannot bind any age-Karma.
Thus it will be seen that out of 24 medium places of thoughtpaints there are only 8 such special medium kinds of thought-paints. which only have the capacity of binding age-Karmas.
Rule for bondage of age Karma in humans and sub-humans of work-region (Karma bhumi) for future incarnation is, that when two-third of their operative age-Karma is exhausted, the first occasion, where a soul may bind age-Karma appears for one antar-mu: hurta. Then again after the expiry of two-third of the remaining age-Karma, the second occasion for bondage of age-Karma appears for an antar-muhurta. Thus after expiry of every two-third part of the remaining age, six more occasions for bondage of age-karma will in succession be presented to the soul. If a soul cannot have the required kind of medium thought-paint in any of these 8 occasions which are called Apakarsha-Kala or declining-times, he must bind it in the last antar-muhurta of his life.
It should be noted that a soul will bind only one of the four age Karmas. He cannot bind more than one. He will gain rebirth in the same condition of existence corresponding to the particular ageKarma bound for future life. It should also be noted that duration

of age-Karma can be increased or decreased in other declining-times, if age-Karma has already been bound in any previous declining time.
In order to illustrate the eight periods of declining-times let us suppose that a human being has got his operative age Karma for a duration of 6561 years. Then the 8 occasions will appear as shown below: Declining times.

Celestials and hellish beings bind it, when only six months are left in their life. All these also have the eight declining-times in the period of 9 or 6 months, respectively.
Humans and sub-humans of work-region where 8 decliningtimes for bondage of age-Karma occur during full length of their age are called Sopakramayushka or with breakable age. They can die early by untimely shedding off of age-Karma molecules on account of suicide, murder, incurable disease, fire, railway accident etc. If no such disturbance occur, they would die after completing their age-Karma fully. Celestials, hellish, humans and subhumans of enjoyment-region as well as some great men out of 63 Shalaka Purushas (24 Tirthankars, 12 Chakravarties, 9 Narayanas, 9 Balbhadras, and 9 Prati-narayanas), who attain liberation from that life are called Anupakramayushka or with unbreakable age. They die a natural death.

(And) the hellish and the (remaining) celestial beings go to the human and sub-human (conditions of existence) corresponding to the particular thought-paints (with which they die).
Commentary, A soul is born always in that condition of existence for which he has bound to himself the age Karma in the eight decliningtimes in which the age-Karma can be bound in life, but the death point is also important, as it seriously affects the future condition of the soul. If no age Karma is bound in the 8 declining-times, then the duration of age-Karma and the condition of existence, both, are determined within the Antar-muhurta which precedes death by an innumerable part of a wink or Avali called Asankshepaddha. But if the age Karma has been bound in one of the previous eight declining-times (Apakarsha-Kala), the condition of existence (Gati) will remain the same, but the soul will go to a higher or lower part of it, according to the character and degree of the thought-paint at the time of death.

Commentary. Beings with one to 4 senses are never reborn as hellish or celestial beings. The irrational 5-sensed developables can be born as residential or peripatetic celestial beings, when dying with yellow-thought-paint, and as hellish, when dying with grey. Humans and sub-humans with subsidential-right-belief do never possess three bad-thought-paints, but when such a right-believer falls from right-belief to the second downfall stage on account of the operation of any of the error-feeding passions, he can have 3 bad-thought-paints in his undevelopable condition.

531. In the right-believing, potentially developable (human and sub-human beings) of enjoyment (regions), necessarily there is the minimum part of grey. In the developable (humans and sub-humans in the enjoyment regions) in their (condition of) right or wrong belief (there are) three good-thought-paints (yellow, pink and white).
Commentary. The right believing potentially developable soul in enjoyment regions has the minimum grey-thought paint, because dying as a right believer he was bound to be born as a male heavenly being, but before he acquired right belief he may have bound an age-Karma for a lower condition of existence. If this condition was human or sub-human then instead of going to heaven he will have to go to the highest enjoyment-region, where we have the best human and sub-human life. The thought-activity at death time of such a soul will be a little painful, and therefore he has minimum greythought-paint also, although in the enjoyment-regions, there are only the three good thought-paints.

In the three, (i.e, 5th, 6th and 7th, stages of) partial vow, (imperfect vow and perfect vow) there are three good thought-paints. From that (the 8th to the 13th stages there is), white thought paint (only). And (there is) no thought-paint in the (14th) stage of nonvibration.
Commentary. Thought-paints are the colours of vibrations coloured with passions. When the vibrations stop, there is no thought-paint.

Commentary. It should be noted that the heavenly celestials have the same thought-paint in their non-developable and developable conditions.

536. The colour of the body produced by the operation of the colour (sub-class of the body making Karma) is matter-paint (Dravya Leshya). The vibration of the soul produced by the operation (in the first four stages), by destructive-subsidence in the 5th, 6th and 7th stages), by subsidence in the 8th, 9th, 10th and 11th, stages of subsidential ladder (Upashama Shreni), and by destruction (in 8th, 9th, 10th, 12th, and 13th) of deluding-Karma (Moha) is thought.(paint) (Bhava Leshya).
Commentary Here vibratory activity would seem to be the same as thoughtpaint. Yoga and Leshya, i.e., Vibration and thought-paint are really not two things but two aspects of the same thing, with the distinction that in one the vibratory activity alone is considered and in the other it is considered as mixed with and coloured by the passions. The vibratory activity is the same. It is never without the tint or taint of passion of some kind or other which is found only in the first 10 stages. The passion-coloured vibration is the thought-paint in these 10 stages. In the next three there is no passion, but there is
ation, which results in white thought-paint, the purest and highest kind of thought-paint. Here although there is no passion, thought-paint is said to exist, because its basis, the vibration still continues, although there is no passion to taint it with any colour.

Notice also that the passionless vibratory-activity is still the cause of inflow of Karmic and Quasi-Karmic matter into the soul. The quasi-Karmic matter, i.e., Aharaka, speech, mind, and electric molecules are assimilited, but the Karmic molecules merely touch the soul for an instant and pass away without binding. Note also that where there is no passion there is inflow only of the molecules of pleasant feeling-Karma (sata vedaniya). Where there is passion, there is an inflow every instant of all the Karmas except the age Karma.

537. The total of (souls) with black, etc., (i. e. black, blue, and grey thought-paints), (should be) divided by an innumerable part of an Avali ; (the quotient) subtracted from the total and the balance equally divided among the three (thought-paints). (The quotient should) again be divided (by an innumerable part of an Avali), (and the resulting quotient subtracted from the first quotient, and added to one of the three equal parts, to get the number of souls in black thought-paint). (The process indicated in Gatha 179 should be adopted to find out the number of souls with other thought-paints). (Soul) substances (may be) described on the basis of time, also, by division, etc. in order, (according to the above process).
Commentary, Let the number of souls with all the three bad thought-paints be 3525, and let an innumerable part of an Avali be 5. Then 3525-5 - 705. And 3525-705-2820. And 2820 should be equally distributed among the three thought-paints. And 2820 : 3 940, which should be assigned to each of the three thought-paints. 705 should again be divided by 5. And the quotient 141, being subtracted from 705, and the balance added to 940, we get 705-141-940 - 1504.

543. The place of (the souls) with (three) bad (thoughtpaints as) to their own place (svasthana), overflow (Samudghata, and) birth-time (is) the whole universe. And (the place of the souls) with three good (thought-paints is) innumerable part of the universe.
Commentary.
Here place or Kshetra signifies the space where at a particular time the souls with respective thought-paints are found.
Fine one-sensed beings, with three bad-paints, are pervading through out the whole universe.
Svasthana is of two kinds, (1) Svasthana Svasthana, the place of their birth (2) Viharavat Svasthana, the place to which they can go out.
Samudghata or overflow means the extending of spatial units of mundane souls out of body to some extent and then resuming their former form. Souls do not leave their own body, but extend out. There are seven occasions when such overflow is possible: -
(1) Vedana samudghata, pain-overflow, emanation on account of extreme and unbearable suffering.
(2) Kashaya samudghata, passion-overflow, emanation on account of passionate thought activity.

(3) Vaikriyika samudghata, fluid overflow-emanation on account of transformation into small or large fluid body or into many such bodies. Celestials do not leave their own place, they send their newly made fluid body with extending soul-units to far off places. Their connection is never ceased.
(4) Maranantika samudghata, death-bed overflow-emanation before death for touching the place of next birth. The soul extends to that point and then contracts and dies thereafter.
(5) Taijasa samudghata, electric overflow-It is possible in
ts with special powers obtained by ascetic practices. It is bad or good. If a saint gets in rage, his soul-units emanate from his left shoulder with electrical matter, and burn the undesirable object. This is bad. A saint being compassionate at seeing famine or disease prevaling anywhere, emanates his soul-units with electric matter from right shoulder. It removes all cause of trouble and brings happiness.
(6) Aharaka Samudghata, assimilative overflowA saint in 6th scriptural stage emanates a man-like white form of one cubit from his head with soul-units. It goes to an omniscient or saint with full scriptural knowledge and sees him. The saint either removes his doubt or enjoys the benefit of personally paying respect to him.
(7) Kevali Samudghata, omniscient overflow-when age Karma has a smaller duration than that of other three Karmas, body-making, family-determining and feeling, then the soul of an omniscient Conqueror overflows and expands throughout the whole universe in 4 instants, and then withdraws to its body in another 4 instants, and the duration of all four Karmas becomes equal.
Upapada means extent of space in the first instant of birth after leaving the last body.
Place should be considered with reference to the above ten conditions, the two Svasthana, seven Samudghata and Upapada. Souls with bad thought-paints are not found in electric, assimilative, and omniscient overflow. For details see sanskrit commentary.

in transmigration. An innumerable part (is) in distant (overflow), and an innumerable part of it (is) in birthplace (Upapada).
Commentary. This gatha mainly refers to the celestials of Saudharma and Ishana heavens. They are with pale thought-paint.
The total number of them is equal to spatial units in the universe line (Jagat shreni) multiplied by a third square root of a cubic finger. Their total being divided by an innumerable part of a Palya, the quotient is the number of those dying in one instant: This quotient should again be divided by an innumerable part of a Palya. The resulting quotient being subtracted from the preceding quotient the balance called "many parts" is the number of those in transmigration with one, two or three turns. This number should again be divided by an innumerable part of a Palya, the quotient being subtracted from the number, the remaining "many parts" balance is the number of those in death-bed overflow. This number being divided by an innumerable part of a palya, the quotient is
he number of those with distant death-bed overflow. This number should again be divided by an innumerable part of a Palya, the quotient is the number of those in the birth-instant.
The number found above multiplied by the place of one soul gives the total place for that.
For the number of pink and white thought-paints and other details see Sanskrit commentary.

_Commentary. Place (Kshetra) is the space in which the soul is at present. Extent (Sparsha) is the space in which the soul has been in the past and is in the present.
Generally the extent of soul with three bad paints is the whole universe for their own place (Svasthana), overflow (Samudghata) and first instant of birth.
In details, the black-paint souls out of the ten places called Padas, for their sphere of birth (Svasthana Swasthana), anguish (Vedna), passion, (Kashaya), death-bed overflow (marnanika samudghata) and instant of birth in transmigration (Upapada) have the whole Universe as their extent.
_ Their extent (Sparsha) of sphere of motion (Viharavat-svasthana) is basic area (Jagatpratar) multiplied by numerable linear finger (Suchi-angula). In their transformation overflow (vaikriyika Samudghata) it is a numerable part of the universe.
In the black-thought-paint there is no electric (Taijasa) Aharka and omniscient (Kevala) overflow.
The extent of blue and grey should be known like that of black. See sanskrit commentary for further details. teuss y shaanne logst asNkhbhaagmettN tu  /

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
Commentary. For the celestial and hellish beings the extra time is equal to 2 Antar-muhurta, because their thought-paint begins one Antarmuhurta before they are born and continues for one Antara-muhurta after their death. The extra time for yellow and pink is little less than half Sagara. It is thus. Saudharma and ishana heavenly beings have the maximum age of 2 Sagaras, but if a right believer with interrupted age (Ghata-yushka) dies prematurely and is born there, he may have an age of 23 Sagaras minus one Antar-muhurta. Similarly a wrong believer dying prematurely can add an extra innumerable part of a Palya to his age. These 2 extras are possible up to the 12th heaven, because no one dying prematurely can be born beyond it. A little less than half Sagara will be added to the prescribed age of each pair of heavens till the 12th heaven.

553-54. The minimum and maximum interval of the three (black, blue and grey thought-paints) is one Antarmuhurta and a little more than 33 Sagaras. This has been said. It is the same for the three yellow (pink and white), but the maximum intervals are necessarily the innumerable matter cycles of existences (Pudgala Parivartana),
Commentary, Interval means time spent in other thought-paints before regaining the one which was left. A soul born in Videha with one crore of Purya age, acquires black thought-paint at the age of 8 vears minus 6 Antar-muhurtas, then he changes into blue, grey, pale, pink and white gradually, each in one Antar-muhurta. Then

he becomes a saint with white thought-paint, retains it for the remaining life, and after death goes to Sarvarth-siddhi for 33 Sagars. There he keeps his white thought-paint. Then he is born a man and for one Antara-muhurta he remains in white paint. Then he begins to transform from white to pink, pale, grey and blue and black each in one Antara-muhurta. The interval for black is thus 33 Sagars, 1 crore Purva years minus 8 years and 10 Antar-muhurtas. This example will show interval of blue and grey also with, respectively, 2 and 4 Antara-muhurtas less than black.
The intervals for the other three thought-paints is no doubt a long time, for only five sensed beings can have them. If a soul has to pass from one-sensed to 4-sensed lives, he can pass a long time there with only 3 bad thought-paints. After a long time, he may become again five-sensed with pale thought-paint.

555. As to quality the six-thought-paints are due to the operation (of Karmas). Their quantity has been described as the number of (their) matter (in sub-chapter of number, Sankhya). Thus the paints are described.
Commentary. The least number is of those with white thought-paint, yet It is innumerable. Its innumerable-fold is the number of those with pink thought-paint. Its numerable fold is the number of those with pale thought-paint. Its infinite fold is the number of souls with grey thought paint. A little more than this is the number of those with blue thought-paint and a little more than this is the number of souls with black thought-paint.

556. Freed from thought-paints, black and others, having crossed (the ocean of mundane ) existences, possessed of infinite bliss, and having acquired the abode of liberation-such liberated souls or the non-vibratory omniscients, should be known to be Paintless (Aleshya).

557. The souls whose liberation is to take place (or who have the capacity of liberation) are capable of liberation (Bhavya siddha or Bhavyas). The opposite to these (are) incapable of liberation (Abhavya). They are never liberated from mundane existence.
Commentary,
Souls as seen by omniscient are of two kinds, Bhavya, capable of liberation, and Abhavya, incapable of liberation. Even in Bhavyas, who have got the capacity, only those who will have favourable circumstances for making efforts for liberation can attain liberation, while those who will never have favourable circumstances will never be liberated.

559. Those souls who are neither capable of liberation (Bhavya), nor incapable of liberation (Abhavya), but have the bliss of liberation (and are) beyond the cycle of infinite existence should be known to be neither Bhavya nor Abhavya.
Commentary. The distinction of Bhavya and Abhavya apply only to the mundane souls.

560. The total number of souls incapable of liberation (Abhavya) is the minimum secondary infinite (Jaghanya Yuktananta). All the mundane souls minus these (is) the total (of) souls capable of liberation (Bhavya).
Commentary. Mundane souls wander in 5 kinds of Parivartana, cycle of wandering:
(1) Dravya-Parivartana, matter cycle. It is of two kinds, quasikarmic and karmic. No-karma, quasi-karmic cycle is the time which soul takes in the renewing exactly the same set of a particular number and quality of molecules, as it took once. Karmic cycle is the time taken in-renewing exactly the same set of a particu number and quality of 8 karmas, as the soul took in once. The time taken in both of these is called one matter cycle or dravya or pudgala parivartana. For example a soul takes on a body to day, with its quasi-karmic and karmic matter. It goes on changing both. When in the course of its changes, it again chances to take on a similar body with similar quasi-karmic and karmic matter, it is said to have completed one matter cycle (Dravya Parivartana).
(2) Kshetra Parivartana. Space-Cycle. The time taken by

one soul in going once, round every single point of space in the universe consecutively, beginning from the foot of Mount Meru.
(3) Kala Parivartana. Time-cycle,-a soul is born in the first samaya, or instant of an Avasarpini, then in the 2nd samaya of another (next or any other) Avasarpini, then in the 3rd samaya of a third, and so on; till in the last samaya it is born in the last samaya of a new Avasarpini. Similarly it must be born in Utsarpini. Then it must die in each samaya of the two eras, like the above. The time taken to go through all this is a Time-Cycle(KalaParivartama.)
(4) Bhava-parivartana, Incarnation-cycle, a soul is born in hell with minimum age of 10,000 years. He is reborn again (after other births) in hell with 10,000 years ago. This goes on as many times as there are samayas in 10,000 years. Then he is reborn there with an age of 10,000 years, and one samaya, then with an age of 10,000 years and 2 samayas, and thus at every birth, he adds one samaya till he is born with the maximum age of 33 Sagaras. The time taken is called Hellish-Cycle. Similarly with the Celestial-Cycle; but there the minimum is 10,000 years and the maximum is only 31 Sagaras, up to the 9th Graiveyaka.
In the sub-human and human-Cycles the minimum is one Antar-muhurta, and the maximum is 3 palyas. The procedure is the same as in the Hellish and Celestial-Cycles.
The time taken in all these four cycles, is called one Incarnation-Cycle.
(5) Bhava-Parivartana. Thought-Cycle.
Innumerable units of soul's, Yoga-sthana, Vibratory activity make one Anubhaga-bandha-Adhyavasaya-sthana, or a degree of the passion which determines intensity of bondage. Innumerable xinnumerable, Anubhaga-bandhas make one Kashaya-dhya-vasaya sthana. 2. e., one degree of passion which determines the duration of bondage. Innumerable x innumerable Kashaya, etc., make one Jaghanya-sthiti-bandha, i. e., minimum duration of bondage in a rational wrong-believing person. This is Antah crore X crore sagars. One sthiti needs that the soul should pass through everyone of the innumerable Yoga-sthanas, to earn one Anubhaga-bandha and then so on, to earn one sthiti. Thus it should go up to the maximum duration of each one of the 8 Karmas, of course adding only one samaya at each step onwards from the minimum duration. When it has thus gone through the 8 karmas and their 148 divisions, it is said to have done one Thought-Cycle (Bhava-parivartana).

Commentary.
Padgula is so-called because it unites and forms into molecules and dissolves into particles, also it modifies in its attributes colour, smell, taste and touch. An atom is in a regular hexagonal. As substance it is one, as to modification, it is possible to say, that it has a six-fold modification from its six faces.

Commentary.
In all substances whether pure or impure, natural modifications of 6 fold increase and 6 fold decrease in infinitesimal degrees of the common attribute of individuality do occur at every instant. It is due to this sort of change that we can attribute rise (Utpada), decay (Vyaya), and continuity (Dhrauvya) in pure souls (Siddhas), and to pure Space, time, media (substances) of motion and rest. These changes are called natural modifications (Svabhava Paryaya). For six-fold increase and decrease see Gatha 322 and those which follow.

570. Time never alters itself into the other ( 5 substances), nor does it change the other (substances into itself). . It is merely the auxiliary help to the other (substances) characterised by different kinds of alterations.

571. By the support of time, ( each) substance is altered in its own modifications. The duration of (each of these) modifications is an instant only from the pure real stand point (i. e., from the actual conditional stand-point, Riju sutra Paryayarthika naya).

the liberated souls multiplied by numerable winks (Avalis).
Commentary, In every period of 6 months and 8 instants, 608 souls leave the primitive common, or Nitya Nigoda, condition; and the same number of souls, enter the abode of liberation from the 2 continents.
The number of siddhas or liberated souls is infinite part of the total of all the souls (mundane and liberated). 6 months and 8 Samayas being reduced to Avalis and divided by 608 would be the numerable Avali mentioned in the gatha.
It would be noticed that the numerable Avalis in the Gatha are constant. They do not vary. They represent the average time for one soul to attain liberation. The number of liberated souls increases every 6 months and 8 instants by 608. This explains the ever-increasing-length of past time by the constant number of of Avalis.

(Achala). In the other mundane souls they are quivering-nonquivering; i.e., all the units quiver from birth to death except the 8 central units which do not quiver. All the same, every unit of soul is bound by Karmic matter. But the bondage is due to the nature of vibration (Yoga capacity to draw in molecules) and not to their being quivering. Therefore these 8 units do not quiver but are bound by Karmic matter.

The other 22 kinds of molecules have minimum, medium and maximum divisions. The minimum and maximum are shown below, between these two there are many medium divisions of successive increase of one atom.

Commentary. Atoms unite together with the difference of 2 degrees. A smooth atom of two degree will unite with a smooth or rough atom of 4 degrees only. Similarly an atom of 3 degrees of roughness will unite with that of 5 degrees of roughness or smoothness only. Atoms having one degree of smoothness or roughness will never unite.

Commentary.
An atom as long as it has got only one degree of smoothness or roughness will neither unite with another atom with one degree nor with other atoms of more degrees. But when degrees of smoothness or roughness are increased in that very atom owing to internal capacity of change and auxiliary cause of other substances, it becomes fit for bondage with other atoms possessing 2 degrees in
excess.

619. In molecules of numerable, innumerable, and in - finite atoms, (the atoms) with greater degrees of smoothness or other (i. e. roughness) when uniting, alter (atoms of) lesser (degree) to their own kind).
Commentary.
This gatha shows that there is the same rule for the union of molecules also. A molecule of 500 degrees will unite with another of 502 only, neither more nor less. Any atom or molecule uniting with another of less degrees than two will transform it into its own kind. When a rough atom with 25 degrees unites with a smooth atom of 23 degrees, the united molecule will be a rough molecule.

able part of a Palya, an innumerable times (the innumerable part of a Palya), numerable times (of this last product), and innumerable times (this last number).
Commentary. Partial vow stage is found in human and sub-human beings. The innumerable part of a Palya souls in this stage as given above refer to sub-humans, and 13 crores of humans should be added to that number. Downfall stage is found in all the four conditions of existence. In this stage there are 52 crores of humans also, and the souls in the other three conditions of existence number innumerable times the souls with partial vow. The mixed stage of rightand-wrong-belief is also found in the four conditions of existence. In this stage the humans are 104 crores; and the number of souls in the other 3 conditions of existence is the numerable times the total of those in downfall stage.
The vowless right-belief is also found in the four conditions. In it the number of humans is 700 crores; and the number of the other 3 is the innumerable times the total of those with mixed right and wrong belief.
The division of Palya by innumerable representing the number of partial vowers means that the Palya is to be divided 3 times by the innumerable and then once by numerable. In the downfall stage, Palya is divided twice by innumerable and then once by numerable. In the mixed stage, Palya is divided twice by innumerable. And in the vowless stage, Palya is divided once by innumerable.

Commentary. The maximum shedding is of course the result of special deliberate austerities, as is shown in multiplicatory series of shedding (Guna Shreni Nirjara) in gathas 66 and 67 above, and in the Tattvartha Sutra, chapter 9 Sutra 45.

646. The belief which is caused by the destruction of right belief-deluding Karma (Darshana Moha and 4 errorfeeding-passions sub-classes of right-conduct-deludingKarma) is perfectly pure. It (is) destructive right-belief (Kshayika Samyaktva so called as it destroys the causes of wrong belief entirely). (It is) eternal and (is) the cause of destruction of Karmas.
Commentary. A soul which has acquired destructive right-belief can attain liberation in the same life. But if before or after its acquisition the soul binds celestial-age-Karma, he will be born as a celestial and if before its acquisition the soul has bound hellish-age-Karma, will be reborn in the first and not in a lower hell, will thereafter be reborn as a man, and then attain liberation. A soul which has acquired destructive right-belief will thus surely attain liberation in the third life. But if before acquiring destructive right-belief he had bound a human, or sub-human age-Karma, he would be reborn in the enjoyment-region, from where he would be reborn as a celestial and then as a man in work-region and attain liberation in his 4th life. Note that destructive right-belief never leaves the soul once it has been acquired. So in hell also there are some souls with right-belief who are just waiting to attain liberation in their next birth. Raja Shrenika alias Bimbasara, father of Ajit-shatru a contemporary and a follower of Lord Mahavira and a devout listener to the letterless speech (Anakshari Vani) in his Samavasarana is such a soul in the first hell. Before attaining destructive rightbelief he had bound a hellish-age-Karma of the maximum kind of 33 Sagaras, on account of having put a dead snake, round the neck of Saint Yeshodhara in meditation. Then he repented and ultimately in the Samavasarana of Lord Mahavira acquired perfect rightbelief and then in the subsequent declining times (Apakarshana Kala) though he could not change the character of th age Karma he had already bound, he reduced the maximum duration of 33 Sagaras of the 7th hell to 84,000 years in the 1st hell, where the minimum is 10,000 years. Thus he has passed about 2,500 years in hell, from where he would be reborn in BharataKshetra after nearly 81,500 years as Padma Nabha, the 1st Tirthankara in the beginning of the third aeon of the next or Utsarpini 'cycle of time and attain liberation after having re-proclaimed Jainism in Bharata-kshetra. It is interesting to note that the

continuity of Jain tradition is curiously evident in the above account. Before the last Tirthankara of the present cycle attained liberation, his teaching was already implanted in a soul so firmly that when the proper time comes it should fructify as exactly the same teaching from the mouth of the first Tirthankara of the next cycle. Lord Mahavira attained liberation 3 years and 8 months before the expiry of the 4th Aeon of the present cycle. The present or the 5th aeon is 21,000 years long, the next one the sixth and the last of the present cycle is also of 21,000 years' duration. The next cycle retraces the course of the present cycle, so that its first two Aeons will be 21,000 years each. And after nearly 84,000 years after Lord Mahavira's liberation the soul of Raja Shrenika which has literally been under the earth for the whole of this long length of darkness will be reborn and blossom forth as Padma Nabha, the propounder afresh of Eternal Truth.

Commentary. Any human soul while he has begun the destruction of right belief-deluding Karma and is on the process of destruction may die and go to any of the four conditions of life. He will complete its destruction there. The beginning of the destruction can only take-place in human life, but the final destruction which must necessarily come-about, may happen in any other condition of existence. dsnnmohudyaado uppjji jN pytthsdhnnN  /

(Vishuddhi), (3) precept (Deshana), (4) Completency (Prayogya), (5) efficiency (Karana), the first four are common (i 8. attainable by all), but the efficiency Karana) is attained only by (soul capable of) right-belief, (and liberation).
Commentary. Kshayopasama-Labdhi, destructive-subsidential attainment, is attainment by a soul (by the subsidence, destruction and operation of certain Karmas) of such senses, mind, etc., that he may be able to acquire right-belief.
Vishuddhi Labdhi-virtue attainment, is attainment of a disposi. tion for good, and against bad actions.
Deshana Labdhi, precept attainment, is attainment of an inclination to know the Truth. This reduces the Sthiti, duration of Karmas except the Ayukarma, the age Karma, to a maximum of Antar Koda Kodi, inter crore of crore, Sagaras and a minimum of one crore (Sagaras).
Prayogya-Labdhi, competency-attainment, is attainment of thought activity which further reduces the Sthiti, duration of the 7 * Karmas, i.e., all except the Ayukarma, age-Karma. But as to intensity of fruition the reduction applies only to demeritorious Karmas. The meritorious Karmas are proportionally increased in intensity of fruition (Anubhaga).
Karana Labdhi -efficiency attainment, is attainment of thoughtactivity which must cause right-belief in one Antar-muhurta, within 48 minutes.

(A soul) attains right-belief (if he is) capable of liberation, (Bhavya) in whichever of the 4 conditions of existence (Gati) he may be, (is) rational, developable (Paryapta), Virtuous, possessed of knowledge attentiveness (i.e. Sakara), awake, with favourable thought-paint, and with efficiency-attainment (Karana Labdhi).

These five are (1) assimilative (Ahara Vargana) which forms the physical, the fluid and the Aharaka bodies; (2) electric (Taijasa), (3) Speech (Bhasha,) (4) mind (Mano) and (5) Karmic (Karmana), of these the first 4 are called quasi-Karmic and the last is called Karmic.

665. The soul constantly assimilates the molecules of one of the three (physical, fluid or Aharaka) bodies, and of speech and mind. Therefore (the soul) is called assi. milative (Aharaka).

888. Souls who are in transmigration (Vigraha Gati), the omniscients (in the 3rd, 4th and 5th instants in omniscient overflow, when they spread sheet-wise across the universe, fill it, and then contract sheet-wise again), and non-vibrating omniscients), and the liberated (souls aree) non-assimilative (Anaharaka). The rest (are) assimilative (Aharaka).

670. The maximum time of an assimilative (Aharaka soul is the number of spatial units in) an innumerable part of a (linear) finger (Suchiangula); and the maximum (time) of the non-assimilative (soul) in the Karmic body ( is ) 3 instants.

Commentary,
Their minima are, respectively, 1 / 18th of a pulse beat minus 3 instants; and one instant.

THE SACRED BOOKS OF THE JAINAS.
Commentary. Here the number of non-vibrating omniscient souls is not included. This calculation is limited to souls up to the.13th stage of vibrating omniscients, because in the 14th stage, there is no vibration, and hence no assimilation of any kind of matter is possible.

679. In the 4 middle (vibrations) of mind and speech (i.e., the false and true of each of them, there are stages) from (wrong-belief) up to the delusionless, in rationals.
 In the other (four vibrations, i. e., true and neitherfalse-nor-true of mind and speech, the stages are from the 1st up to the 13th), the vibratory omniscient; but neither (true-nor-false) speech (vibration begins) from the incomplete sensed (i. e., 2, 3 and 4 sensed).

681. (These four stages are) wrong belief, downfall, Vowless belief, (asamyata) stage in soul with masculine inclination, and the ( 13th stage of ) door-leaves-wise (Kapata). Vibratory omniscient, (in the 2nd and 7th instants of the omniscient overflow). These two (i. e., Physical and physical-mixed vibrations) are only in humans and subhumans. It has been described by the Conquerors.

682. In the fluid body vibration in developable, celestial and hellish beings (there are) the first four stages. In the other (i.e, non-developable) there is the mixed, i.e. fluidmixed-with-Karmic body vibration). This mixed vibration (exists) not in (the third stage of) mixed (right-and-wrongbelief).
Commentary.
In mixed-fluid-vibration only three spiritual stages are possible i.e. wrong belief, downfall and vowless right belief.

688. In the assimilative (body vibration) in the developable there is the 6th stage for the duration of one Antar-muhurta. In the other (ie., non-developable) certainly is the mixed (ie, assimilative-mixed-with physicalbody vibration), (in which) 6th assimilation there is the stage for one Antar-Muhurta).

684. Like the physical-mixed (with Karmic body vibration), the Karmic (body-vibration) is in the same 4 stages. (But the difference is that) it is at the time of transmigration for the 4 conditions of existence, and in the vibratory omniscient stage (it is at the 3rd, 4th and 5th instant: of) the sheet-wise and whole universe (and again sheet-wise forms of omniscient overflow).

Commentary. When vibratory omniscient is silent, only three vitalities are working, but when respiration is ceased, only 2 vitalities remain.

The first (of these 3, i.e., fear) drops off at the end of (the 8th stage), new-thought activity, (Apurva-karana). The remaining (coition and attachment drop off, respectively, at the end of the 9th, i e.) advanced-thought-activity (and the 10th, i.e.) slightest (passion, Sukshma Samparaya).

715. In a soul (i.e. a saint) with feminine inclination in the imperfect vow stage necessarily there never are (the vibrations of) the two assimilative (Aharaka. and assimilative-mixed-with physical Aharaka Mishra). And in a soul with feminine inclination in sexless part of the 9th stage, (sex) inclination is mentioned from the point of view of the past (i.e, figurative or Naigama-naya point of view).
Commentary. The word "Tu" in the gatha refers to the following, (1) Mental knowledge and pure and absolute-non-injury control are not acquired by saints when they are under operation of feminine and common sex-inclination, (2) A woman can only have the first five spiritural stages. (3) second subsidential right-belief and mental
nowledge are not possible in saint with assimilative body or pureabsolute-non-injury-control.
