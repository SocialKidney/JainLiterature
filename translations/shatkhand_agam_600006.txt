**Publication Statement**

The revered Acharya Shantisagarji Maharaj entrusted us with the task of serving and spreading the teachings of Jinvani Mata. We have been diligently fulfilling this responsibility to the best of our abilities. As per Acharya Maharaj's directive, we are constantly striving to publish high-quality principle texts. This publication of the significant principle text, Patkhandagam, is a beautiful outcome of our efforts and is now reaching the hands of readers. Only the studious will be able to determine our level of success, but we believe that this publication stands out amongst our previous works.

After the three principle texts were engraved on copper plates, Acharya Maharaj expressed his desire to publish their original texts along with Hindi translations. Accordingly, he entrusted the task of completing the first principle text, Shatkhandagam, to Bal Br. Shri. Sumatibaiji Nyaya-Kavya Tirth, daughter of Shri. Nemchand Devchand Shah, Solapur, and the director of Shri Ra. Di. Jain Shravakashram, Solapur. We are immensely delighted that the fulfillment of this task marks the completion of Acharya Maharaj's aforementioned wish.

Shri. Seth Hirachand Talakchandji, Baramati, has generously provided financial assistance of 4001 for the publication of this text. We are deeply grateful for his support. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to all the scholars and institutions who have contributed to the editing and publication of this text.

**Brief Introduction**

Shreyahpadmavikasa Vasaramani, Syadvad Rakshamani, Sansarorag Darpag Garuda Mani, Bhavyaugha Chintamani, Ashantakshay Shanti Mukti Mahishi Simanta Muktamani, Shreemad Dev Shiromani Vijayate Shree Vardhamano Jina.

The entire Digambar Jain community is well acquainted with the life story and message of Acharya Shree Shantisagar Maharaj. Acharya Shree's life was full of penance and glory. During his lifetime, countless religious works were completed and various institutions were established. In his Samadhi-kal, he gave unique advice for the success of life according to his self-realization and Agam, guiding the world towards happiness and peace. This advice included two paths: the first, the path of self-reflection, and the second, the pure and accessible path of continuous Agam-raksha and knowledge-donation. The path of self-reflection is personal, yet studying Agam is essential for self-confidence before embarking on this path. To make Agam accessible to all, Acharya Shree inspired the provision of invaluable scriptures through his teachings from time to time. As a result, the Parampujya Charitra Chakravarti Shri 108 Acharya Shantisagar Digambar Jain Jinvaani Jirnoddharak Sanstha was born.

At this time, Acharya Shree learned that the most ancient and revered scriptures of the Digambar sect, Shri Shatkhandagam (Dhaval), Kasayapahuḍ (Jayadhaval), and Mahabhand (Maha Dhaval), were in the form of palm leaf manuscripts, available only in Moodbidri, and were deteriorating. One of these scriptures had lost five thousand verses, and the remaining leaves crumbled when touched. Upon learning this, Acharya Shree's heart was filled with sorrow, and the thought of how to protect this invaluable Agam treasure, so that these scriptures could remain safe for generations to come, constantly occupied his mind. He shared his desire with some prominent members of the community, suggesting that if these scriptures were engraved on copper plates, this priceless Shruti treasure would be preserved for ages. Accordingly, the "P.P. Cha. Cha. Shri 108 A. Shantisagar Di. Jain Jinvaani Jirnoddharak" Sanstha was established on the Paryushana festival of Veer Samvat 2470 at the holy site of Kunthalagiri.

---------------------------
Thereafter, in the month of Falgun of V.S. 2471, when Acharya Shri arrived in Baramati, the rules of the said institution were formulated and registered according to law. Under the supervision of officials and experienced scholars, the three principle texts were engraved on copper plates. The size of the engraved copper plates is 8x13 inches. The number of copper plates for the three principle texts is 2664, weighing approximately 50 man. Along with this, five hundred copies of each of the three texts were also printed, which will be used by officials, scholars, and self-study loving readers for a long time. Such a great work has not been done in the Jain community, nor in any other Indian or foreign society.

The above three principle texts have been published with Hindi translation from various institutions, and the present text, Shatkhandagam, is presented before the readers in its original form along with Hindi translation, the introduction of which has already introduced these text-kings, so it would be redundant to mention it here.

In V.S. 2480, Acharya Shri's Chaturmas was held in Phaltan. At this time, Acharya Shri presented a creative plan for Agam preservation and knowledge donation before the society. As a result, a new building was constructed from the remaining funds collected during Acharya Shri's Diamond Jubilee celebration at the temple of Shri 1008 Chandra Prabh, for the protection of the copper-engraved text-kings, in which this entire Shruti treasure is kept very securely.

As soon as Acharya Shri embraced Sallekhana, a great change became visible in his teachings. Until now, Acharya Shri mostly preached for the welfare of householders, for the sake of Jinbimb, Jinagar, and worship etc. pious deeds. But now you have experienced that without scriptural study, religious faith will not be firm, and without the accessibility of scriptures, self-study will not be possible, therefore, there should be accessibility of Agams in the Jin temples of every village. If the scriptures, which are the means of self-study, are in translation, then the people will benefit greatly. Therefore, scriptures should be available to self-study lovers without any cost. Inspired by Acharya Shri's above pronouncements, the Di. Jain Samaj of Phaltan established the Shruti Bhandar and Granth Prakashan Samiti, certified by the previously established P.P. Cha. Cha. Shri 108 A. Shanti Sagar Di. Jain Jinvani Jirnoddharak Sanstha. All the brothers of Phaltan enthusiastically cooperated in the construction and development of this institution. The objectives for which this institution was established are as follows:

(1) Ancient and renovated Shri Dhavala etc. text-kings should be kept safe by this institution, and the work of their protection should be continuously done by the residents of Phaltan under their responsibility.

(2) The work of protecting the copper plates of the Shri Dhavla Granth and other printed copies of the Granth and making arrangements for their dissemination of knowledge should be done.
(3) Arrangement of a suitable and good building for the fulfillment of these two objectives.
(4) To print important texts with the original verses and sutras along with translations in the prevalent languages for the study of the Agam Granths and to make arrangements for the dissemination of knowledge.
The work done in this period for the fulfillment of the above objectives is before the society. The list of the Granth Ratna which are ready for distribution after being printed, keeping in mind the pure objective of knowledge dissemination, and the auspicious names of those who have donated for the printing expenses only are as follows:

Shri Padmaraj Vaidya, Nimgaon
Shri Hirachand Talakchand, Baramati
As per the indication and order of Acharya Maharaj, paper has been provided by the institution for all the Granths. A plan has been made to ensure that one copy of each Granth reaches every city and village where Jain brothers and Jain temples exist. One copy is also given free of cost to all the members of the institution.

We are grateful to the noble people of the society who have provided financial assistance in the establishment and development of the institution, due to which great work is being done by the institution, and who are the main reason for making the intangible order of Acharya Maharaj concrete and operational. We are also grateful to the donors who have generously provided financial assistance in the printing of the Granths.
We hope that other generous and religious-minded people of the society will actively participate in this important work of spreading the supremely sacred and world-purifying Jinavani and express their generosity, so that the work of the institution continues to grow.

Today, Acharya Shri is not in front of us, however, by holding his sacred command on our heads, we were able to do as much work as we could in his presence, from which he experienced supreme satisfaction during his Sallekhana period. And according to his command and desire, we are presenting the Shatkhandagama composed by Bhagwan Pushpadanta and Bhootbali in its original form along with a Hindi translation to the readers for self-study, experiencing supreme joy.
Acharya Shri was a peaceful mind, a deep ascetic, an influencer of Jain Dharma, a promoter of the path of liberation, a celibate from childhood, and a well-wisher of the world. Through him, the great work of renovation and dissemination of the scripture-like material body of Bhagwati Jinvani Mata, the form of this supreme path, has taken place. There is no power for society to express gratitude to such a great Acharya in any word or meaning. True gratitude can only be expressed through deep faith in Dharma, unwavering devotion in character, inclination towards self-study and self-reflection, and conduct accordingly, as per his teachings and orders. It was impossible to start this great work without the late, most revered Acharya Shri. All this work is the result of his extraordinary teachings, orders, guidance, and continuous inspiration. We remember him with utmost faith and devotion, and even though he is not physically present, we offer him hundreds of salutations and express our goodwill. We pray that we, along with the entire Jain community, remain vigilant and aware for the fulfillment of the desire to spread the true Dharma.
Seeing, seeing the form of Surishanta, drinking, drinking the nectar of words. Remembering, remembering his qualities, those whose feet have touched, have become peaceful, virtuous, and devoted to the eyes.

## Introduction of Shri Hirachand Talakchand Shah

Sheth Hirachand Talakchand Shah, belonging to the Kamaleshwar Gotra, hails from Dorlewadi. His ancestors were from Bhilwade village, located in the Inder district of Gujarat. His great-grandfather (pradada) came to Maharashtra for business purposes. He had four brothers: Rakchand, Tarachand, Devchand, and Khemchand. Rakchand had a son named Dalchand, who had two sons: Talakchand and Maganlal. Talakchand had three sons: Hirachand, Manikchand, and Motichand. Among them, Hirachand Shah has undertaken the responsibility of publishing this book. He has four sons: Chandrakant, Suryakant, Kiran, and Shrenik, and two daughters: Vimala and Surekha. His wife's name is Ratanbai. She is currently 75 years old and remains dedicated to religious activities even in her old age.

Sheth Hirachand's great-grandfather and his four brothers constructed a temple dedicated to Ratnatraya Prabhu in Phaltan and donated 3000 to ensure its daily worship and rituals.

In Samvat 1964, Sheth Hirachand's father, Talakchandji, opened a shop in Baramati, which is now run by Hirachandji. In memory of Rakchand Kasturchand, Sheth Talakchand donated 1500 to the Dhavy Fund of the Ailak Pannalal Jain Pathshala in Baramati. Similarly, he donated 2500 for the construction of a room in the Bahubali Brahmacharyashram in Kumbhoj, in memory of his father. He also donated 1000 for the construction of the Acharya Bhootbaliki idol in Borivali, Mumbai, and another 500 in the name of Sheth Talakchand. He has also donated 1000 for the construction of the idol of Bahubali Swami. He is constantly dedicated to donating for religious causes. In addition, he donated 2002 in the names of Talakchand Dalchand Shah and Hirachand Talakchand Shah for the copper plate of the Dhaval Granth.

In Samvat 2011, when Acharya Shantisagar Maharaj was residing in Lonand, Sheth Hirachand, inspired by the Maharaj's teachings, donated 4001 for the publication of the Dhaval Granth with its original sutras and Hindi translation. This is a result of the blessings of Acharya Maharaj.

Sheth Hirachand's father, Shri Sheth Talakchandji, was a very patient, ethical, and wise advisor. In the Paush month of Samvat 2019, he embraced Sallekhana in Baramati and departed from this world, remembering the Panchparmeshti, ascending to heaven.

Sheth Hirachand's third wife, Hiraमति, is equally dedicated to religious activities and serving the Guru, just like her husband. Thus, their entire family is devout.

We wish their family well.

## Foreword

It has been about 11-12 years since I visited Baramati to have Darshan of Shri 108 Param Pujya Acharya Shantisagarji Maharaj. During our conversation, he instructed me to edit the original texts of the Shatkhandagama with Hindi translation and publish it through the A. Sha. Ji. Jirnoddharak Sanstha. At that time, considering the gravity of the text and my limited knowledge, I requested him, "Maharaj, I doubt if I can accomplish this great task." To this, Maharaj firmly said, "There is no reason to doubt. A large part of Acharya Veersen Swami's Dhavala Tika along with its Hindi translation has already been published from Amravati. You can easily complete this work with its help." I then accepted the task, saying, "Maharaj, I don't consider myself worthy, but since you have commanded it, I accept it. However, it is certain that your blessings will be instrumental in completing this arduous task."

Subsequently, I began the work and was searching for a suitable scholar to ensure its flawless and accurate completion and for further revisions. Meanwhile, Shri Pan. Balachandraji Shastri was appointed to the Jain Sanskriti-Sanrakshak Sangh established by Shri Br. Jivraj Gautamchandji Doshee in Solapur and he arrived here. He played a significant role in the publication of the Shatkhandagama from Amravati. Therefore, I met him and requested him to edit this work, which he not only readily accepted but also began actively assisting me whenever possible. Thus, the work started progressing. Finally, when it was ready for printing, it was sent to the press. Now, after the completion of the printing process, I feel an unprecedented joy in presenting it to the hands of the studious and consider it the fruit of the blessings of the ever-memorable, revered A. Shantisagarji Maharaj, whose influence has continuously provided me with the necessary resources and materials for the completion of this work.

The entire credit for the completion of this work goes to my revered teacher, Pan. Balachandraji Shastri. I can confidently say that if he had not actively assisted in editing the text, its completion by me would have been, if not impossible, then certainly very difficult. For this, I express my heartfelt gratitude to him.

Another scholar, Shri Pan. Hiralalji Siddhanta Shastri, residing in Sadhumar (Jhansi), is someone I cannot forget. He came to Solapur and contributed to the introduction of this text...

I have written the title 'Introduction to the Subject of Mahabandha' and have also included in the preface the essay comparing the present text with texts like Tattvarthasutra, Sarvarthasiddhi, Tattvarthavartika, Gommatasar, Karma-prakriti and Jivasamaas, which will be useful for future research. In addition, you have also helped in preparing some appendices. I am very grateful to you for this.
The sixteen-part edition of the Dhavla-tika-yukt Shatkhandagama published from Amravati has been used extensively in the editing of the text. For this, I am deeply indebted to the publishing institution and editors of the said text.
I am extremely grateful to the Managing Committee of the A. Sha. Jinavani Jirnoddharak Sanstha, Phaltan, which has honored me by arranging for the publication of this book. Also, the financial assistance of Rs. 4001 provided by Shri. Seth Hirachand Talakchand Shah Dorlewadikar for the publication of the book cannot be forgotten.
Finally, I cannot thank Shri. Prakashchandra Fulchand Shah, the owner of Vardhaman Printing Press, without whom the printing of the book would not have been possible. He has shown utmost diligence in the printing work.
It is regrettable that Acharya Shantisagarji Maharaj, whose blessings have made this arduous task possible, is not here today. Nevertheless, his celestial soul will surely be pleased with this work.
Shravikashram, Solapur.

## Introduction

After the Nirvana of Bhagwan Mahavira, Gautam, Sudharma and Jambuswami were the first three to become Kevalis, holding all the Shruta (scriptural knowledge) and later only the knowledge of Kevala (omniscience). Their period was 62 years. After that, in 100 years, five Acharyas became Shruta Kevalis, knowing the complete twelve Angas (canonical texts): 1. Vishnu, 2. Nandi Mitra, 3. Aparajit, 4. Govardhan and 5. Bhadrabahu. Subsequently, eleven Acharyas became the knowers of eleven Angas and ten Purvas (ancient texts): 1. Vishakacharya, 2. Proshthil, 3. Kshatriya, 4. Jay, 5. Nag, 6. Siddharth, 7. Dhriti Sen, 8. Vijay, 9. Buddhil, 10. Gangdev and 11. Dharma Sen. Their period was 183 years. After that, five Acharyas became the holders of eleven Angas: 1. Nakshatra, 2. Jaypal, 3. Pandu, 4. Dhruvsen and 5. Kans. Their period was 220 years. After that, four Acharyas became the holders of only the Acharanga (one of the twelve Angas): 1. Subhadra, 2. Yashobhadra, 3. Yashobahu and 4. Lohary. Their period was 118 years. After this, the tradition of Angas and Purva knowers ended and all the Angas and Purvas were received by Acharya Dharasen from the Acharya tradition, knowing only one part. He was known for his unique knowledge of the fourth Maha Karma Prakriti Prabhrit (four major karmic categories).

This tradition of Shruta Avatara (transmission of scriptural knowledge) is according to Swami A. Vira Sen, the author of the Dhavala Tika, and Indranandi. The same order of Shruta Avatara is also found in the available Prakrit Pattavali (genealogical list) of the Nandi Sangha. Only some names of the Acharyas differ. However, according to the above chronology, it is clear that Acharya Dharasen came after 62 + 100 + 183 + 220 + 118 = 683 years after the Nirvana of Bhagwan Mahavira. According to the Pattavali of the Nandi Sangha, the period of Acharya Dharasen falls 614 years after the Nirvana of Bhagwan Mahavira. The Brihattippani, written by a Svetambar scholar and considered very authentic, places the period of Dharasen 600 years after the Nirvana of Bhagwan Mahavira.

Acharya Dharasen lived in the Chandragupta (Chandragufa) cave of Girinagar (Girnar mountain) in Kathiawad. When he became very old and saw his life remaining very short, he was worried that the knowledge of Shruta was declining day by day due to the influence of the Avasarpini Kala (period of decline). He thought, "Even today, no one has as much Shruta as I have. If I cannot entrust my Shruta to someone else, it will also end with me." With this concern and for the protection of Shruta, he composed the Yoni Prabhrit.

1. "Yoni Prabhritam Viraat 600 Dharasenam" (Brihattippani, Jain Sahitya Samsad, 1, 2, Appendix). This means that Acharya Dharasen composed the Yoni Prabhrit 600 years after the Nirvana of Bhagwan Mahavira. The Dhavala author also mentions the Yoni Prabhrit.

##  Chapter 2: The Six Realms and the Story of Acharya Dharasen

Motivated by affection, Acharya Dharasen sent a letter to the assembly of monks taking place in the southern region, expressing his desire. The chief preceptors present at the assembly read Acharya Dharasen's letter with great seriousness and sent two worthy monks to him. These monks were capable of receiving and retaining the scriptures, adorned with various kinds of brilliant and pure conduct, holders of the garland of virtue, pure in terms of country, family, and caste, and proficient in all arts.

On the eve of the day when these two monks were to arrive in Girinagar, Acharya Dharasen saw a dream in which two white and humble bulls came and bowed at his feet. Upon seeing this dream, Acharya Dharasen woke up and said, "The goddess of scriptures, Jayavanti, is present." On that very day, the two monks sent from the southern region arrived at Acharya Dharasen's place. They were overjoyed and performed the rituals of bowing at his feet, etc. After resting for two days, on the third day, they told Acharya Dharasen the purpose of their arrival. Acharya Dharasen was also very pleased to hear their words and blessed them, saying, "May you be well."

A thought arose in Acharya Dharasen's mind that he should first test these two newly arrived monks to see if they were worthy of receiving and retaining the scriptures. He thought that teaching knowledge to individuals who wander freely would only increase worldly desires and fear. With this thought in mind, he decided to test these two newly arrived monks. Accordingly, Acharya Dharasen gave them two mantras to practice. One mantra was short and the other was long. He gave each of them one mantra and said, "Practice these mantras with a six-day fast (two days of fasting)." The two monks took the mantras from their guru and sat on the stone marking the nirvana of Bhagwan Neminath* and began practicing the mantras. When they mastered the mantras, they saw the presiding deities of the mantras. One goddess had her teeth protruding, and the other was one-eared. Seeing these deformed features of the goddesses, the two monks thought, "Deities do not have deformed features. Therefore, there must be some error in the mantras!" Thus, they considered the matter and, being skilled in the grammar of mantras, they corrected their respective mantras. They removed the extra letters from the longer mantra and added letters to the shorter mantra. Then they began practicing their mantras again. The two mantra deities then appeared in their natural beautiful forms and said, "Master, command us, what shall we do?" The two monks replied, "We have no worldly or otherworldly purpose from you. We have practiced these mantras only by the command of our guru." Hearing this,

## Introduction.

The goddesses departed to their respective abodes. Pleased with the success of their mantra-sadhana, they approached Ārya Dharasen and, after prostrating at his feet, narrated the entire account of their attainment of knowledge. Seeing the fulfillment of his intention and the worthiness of the assembled ascetics, Ārya Dharasen was very pleased and, saying "very good," he commenced teaching the text on an auspicious day, in an auspicious constellation, and on an auspicious day. Thus, while explaining the text in sequence, Ārya Dharasen completed it on the morning of the eleventh lunar day of the bright fortnight of Āṣāḍha. Knowing that these two ascetics had diligently studied the text from their guru, the gods of the past births performed worship of one of them with garlands of flowers, accompanied by the playing of conch shells, drums, and other musical instruments. Seeing this, Dharasenācārya named him 'Bhūtabali'. And the gods, with great ceremony, worshipped the other ascetic, whose disarranged teeth were extracted and aligned. Seeing this, Dharasenācārya named him 'Puṣpadanta'.

Knowing that his death was imminent, and thinking that these two should not be distressed by his separation, and seeing that the rainy season was approaching, Dharasenācārya ordered them to return to their respective abodes on that very day. Although both ascetics wished to remain in the presence of their guru for a little longer, they thought, "One should not violate the words of the guru," and left that very day. They spent the rainy season in Ankalēśvara (Gujarat). After the rainy season, Puṣpadanta Ācārya, along with his nephew Jinpālit, went to the country of Vanavāsa, and Bhūtabali Bhaṭṭāraka went to the country of Dramila.

Thereafter, Puṣpadanta Ācārya initiated Jinpālit and composed the sūtras of Satprārupaṇā, containing twenty forms of guṇasthāna, etc., and, after teaching them to Jinpālit, sent him to Bhūtabali Ācārya. He saw the sūtras of Satprārupaṇā, containing twenty forms, with Jinpālit, and, knowing that Puṣpadanta Ācārya was short-lived, he thought, "Lest the destruction of the great karma-nature, etc., occur," and, taking Dravyapramāṇānugam as the beginning, composed the subsequent text. When the composition of the text was completed and written down, on the fifth lunar day of the bright fortnight of Jyeṣṭha, Bhūtabali Ācārya, with the fourfold assembly, performed the worship of that text with great ceremony. From that time, this date became known as Śrutapañcamī. And, on this day, Jain people have been continuously performing Śruta-pūjanā till today. After this, Bhūtabali sent this six-part Āgama, composed by him and written down, to Ācārya Puṣpadanta through the hands of Jinpālit. Seeing this six-part Āgama and knowing that the work he had begun was successfully completed, he was extremely pleased and also performed the worship of this principle text with the fourfold assembly.

1. On the fifth lunar day of the bright fortnight of Jyeṣṭha, with the fourfold assembly gathered together. He performed the worship of that text with the performance of actions, with the means of that text. ||143||
This date is known as Śrutapañcamī, the most excellent one. Even today, on that day, Jains perform Śruta-pūjanā. ||144||

It is thus established that from the eight forms of the nature of the place of nature, which are the natural and unbreakable divisions of the bondage system, the first form of the first section called Jiva-sthana, the third form of the field, the fourth form of touch, the fifth form of time, the sixth form of space, and the eighth form of fewness-manyness have emerged. The seventh form of feeling has originated from the twenty-third feeling-anuyogadvara of the one-after-the-other nature-place. The second form of number has originated from the fifth dravya-pramananugama anuyogadvara among the eleven anuyogadvaras of the bondage. The remaining four chulikas of Jiva-sthana have originated as follows:

## Introduction
Fifth Vyākhyāprajñapti Anga
Gati - Āgati (Ninth Chūlikā)

Thus, in the first section called Jīvasthāna, the origin of the nine Chūlikās should be known in the manner described above.
[7]

From the above mentioned Trivechana, the reader will arrive at two conclusions - first, that the scope of the Dvādaśāṅga Śruta is vast. And second, that the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama, being derived from the Dvādaśāṅga Śruta, has a direct connection with the words of Bhagavān Mahāvīra. From this, the importance of the present treatise is self-evident.

## Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama - Introduction

It is clear from the above discussion that the present treatise does not originate from a single Anuyōgadvāra; but from different Anuyōgadvāras and their sub-sections within the twenty-four Anuyōgadvāras, starting from Mahākarmaprākṛti, different parts of the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama have originated. Therefore, it is called Khaṇḍa-Āgama. And since this Āgama has six sections, it is known as Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama. Its six sections are as follows: 1. Jīvasthāna, 2. Khuddābandha (Kṣudrabandha), 3. Bandhasvāmitvavičaya, 4. Vedanā, 5. Vargaṇā and Mahābandha.

## Jīvasthāna

This section, taking refuge in Guṇasthāna and Mārgāṇasthāna, describes the various states of the Jīva through the eight Anuyōgadvāras of Sat, Saṅkhyā, Kṣetra, Sparśana, Kāla, Antara, Bhāva and Alp bahutva, and through the nine Chūlikās of Prākṛtisamutkīrtanā, Sthānasamutkīrtanā, Three Mahādanḍaka, Jaghanyasthiti, Utkrṣṭasthiti, Samyaktvōtpatti and Gatiāgati.

## Rāga, Dveṣa and Mithyātvabhāva

Rāga, Dveṣa and Mithyātvabhāva are called Moha. The fluctuation of the Ātma-pradeśas through the means of Mana, Vachana and Kāya is called Yoga. Due to these Moha and Yoga, the stages of gradual development of the Ātma-guṇas, Darsana, Jñāna and Chāritrarūpa, are called Guṇasthāna. There are fourteen Guṇasthāna: 1. Mithyātv, 2. Sāsādana, 3. Miśra, 4. Avirātasamyagdṛṣṭi, 5. Deśasaṃyata, 6. Pramattasaṃyata, 7. Apramattasaṃyata, 8. Apūrvakaraṇasaṃyata, 9. Anivṛttikaraṇasaṃyata, 10. Sūkṣmasaṃpārāyasaṃyata, 11. Upśāntamoha Chhadmastha, 12. Kṣīṇamoha Chhadmastha, 13. Sayogikevalī and 14. Ayogikevalī.

## Mithyātvaguṇasthāna

Although the nature of the Jīva is Samyagdarsana, Jñāna, Chāritrarūpa, or in other words, Sat Chit Ānandarūpa, yet this Ātma, due to the Mohakarma,

## Chapter 8: The Six Stages of Existence

**The Chhakhandagam**

Due to the strong force of **udaya** (arising), the soul has been wandering in delusion since time immemorial.  Because of the powerful influence of **mohakarma** (karma of delusion), it does not strive to attain its true nature. Instead, it remains restless in pursuit of worldly objects that are not its own. This false perception or misinterpretation of the soul is called **mithyatva** (falsehood). Those souls who possess this **mithyatva** are called **mithyadrishti** (those with false vision). The tendency of **mithyadrishti** souls is to always dwell in **kṣayās** (passions) and they have no understanding of **dharma** (righteousness) and **adharma** (unrighteousness). The majority of beings in the world are situated in this state of **mithyatva**.

The duration of this **mithyatva** state is of three types:

1. **Anadi-ananta** (beginningless and endless): Those souls whose **mithyatva** has been ongoing since time immemorial and will continue for an infinite time, meaning they have never attained true vision and will never attain it in the future. These **abhavya** (non-liberated) **mithyadrishti** souls have a **mithyatva** state that is **anadi-ananta**.

2. **Anadi-santa** (beginningless and finite): Those souls whose **mithyatva** has been ongoing since time immemorial but who, through effort, will overcome it and attain true vision, becoming **samyagdristi** (those with right vision) and ascending to higher stages. Their **mithyatva** has an end, so its duration is called **anadi-santa**.

3. **Sadi-santa** (finite and finite): Those souls whose **mithyatva** has been overcome and who have attained true vision once and ascended to higher stages, but due to the influence of **karmodya** (arising of karma), have fallen back into the **mithyatva** state. Their **mithyatva** has both a beginning and an end, as it will eventually be overcome. Therefore, its duration is called **sadi-santa**.

Thus, there are three types of souls found in the **mithyatva** state.

**The Second Stage: Saasadan**

When the soul strives to attain its true nature and through this effort gains true vision, it immediately jumps from the first stage to the fourth stage. However, due to the arising of **anantabandhi kṣayās** (passions that bind for an infinite time), which have subsided but not completely extinguished, it falls back down. This downward movement is the second stage. The name **saasadan** refers to the negation of **samyagdarshan** (right vision), and because it is associated with this negation, this stage is called **saasadan**. The duration of this stage is at least one **samaya** (moment) and at most six **avali** (periods of time). No soul can remain in this stage for longer than this. After this, it inevitably falls back to the first stage.

**The Third Stage: Misra or Samyagmithyatva**

When the soul in the fourth stage experiences the arising of **samyagmithyatva** (mixed vision) karma, which is a type of **darshanamohaniya karma** (karma that obscures vision), it falls from the fourth stage to the third stage, the **misra** stage. In this stage, the soul's state is a mixture of both **samyaktva** (rightness) and **mithyatva** (falsehood), hence its name **misra** or **samyagmithyatva**. The shortest and longest duration of this stage is **antarmuhurta** (a very short period of time). If, upon the completion of this time, the soul...

---------------------------
## Introduction

If one strives to ascend, they can reach the fourth stage of spiritual progress, otherwise, they fall back to the first stage.

## The Fourth Stage: Samyagdristi (Right Vision)

When a being in the first stage, through effort, abandons their eternal false vision and attains true vision, they reach the fourth stage. This true vision is called Samyagdarshan or Samyaktva in Jain terminology. The true nature of the soul is pure, wise, and peaceful, devoid of passions like attachment, aversion, delusion, lust, anger, etc. It is Sat-Chit-Anandamaya (existence-consciousness-blissful). The being with false vision had not yet seen this pure nature of the soul, and therefore considered their current state of existence as their true self. When the false vision is shed and the true vision emerges, it is like a blind person regaining their sight and seeing the true form of everything. Similarly, the Samyagdristi being sees the true form of their own soul.

With this self-realization, they experience an indescribable joy and become free from the worldly desires that they previously clung to. They dive into the ocean of independent happiness, free from anxieties. Due to the absence of passions, they experience a state of calmness. True knowledge fills their hearts with detachment and compassion for all beings. They develop a strong belief in their own spiritual progress and desire to remain in this state. This belief strengthens their faith in Jain principles. They recognize the inherent qualities of knowledge, vision, happiness, strength, and energy within themselves. They become introspective, abandoning outward focus and worshipping the pure, eternal, omniscient Supreme Soul residing within them. They become indifferent to worldly affairs.

The Samyagdristi being's actions become pure. Their unjust tendencies disappear, and they engage in righteous livelihood. There are two types of karmas that cause delusion: Darshanmohaniya (delusion of vision) and Charitramohaniya (delusion of conduct). In this stage, the being does not have the inclination to follow vows, conduct, and discipline due to the presence of Charitramohaniya karma. However, the infinite consequences of anger, pride, deceit, and greed, which are associated with Charitramohaniya karma, along with Darshanmohaniya karma, experience cessation, destruction, and destruction-cessation in this stage.

The temporary absence of these karmas is called cessation. Their complete destruction is called destruction. The destruction of these harmful karmas and the simultaneous emergence of the beneficial Samyaktva (right conduct) nature is called destruction-cessation. The Samyagdarshan arising from the cessation of Darshanmohaniya karma is called cessation-based right vision. The Samyagdarshan arising from the destruction of Darshanmohaniya karma is called destruction-based right vision. The Samyagdarshan arising from the destruction-cessation of Darshanmohaniya karma is called destruction-cessation-based right vision. The dominance of the emergence of the Samyaktva nature, i.e., ...

## Chapter 10: The Sixfold Path

**The Sixfold Path**

Those who experience the arising of **Vedana** (experience) are also called **Vedaka Samyagdarshana** (perfect vision).  Those who attain **Kshayika Samyagdarshana** (perfect vision that destroys the karmas) never fall back, meaning they never attain **Mithyatva** (false vision). They have no doubt about the principles taught by the Jinas, and they are not surprised by the excesses of the **Mithyadrishtis** (those with false vision).

**Aupashmika Samyagdarshana** (perfect vision that is temporary) is similar, but due to the effects of karma, it can abandon **Upashma Samyaktva** (temporary perfect vision) and enter the **Mithyatva Gunasthan** (state of false vision). It can also attain the **Sasadan Gunasthan** (state of partial liberation), the **Samyagmithyatva Gunasthan** (state of mixed vision), and even **Vedaka Samyagdarshana**.

Those who have **Kshayopaashmika** or **Vedaka Samyagdarshana** have weak faith. Just as the stick in the hand of an old man, though firmly planted in the ground, still shakes from above, so too does the faith of a **Vedaka Samyagdarshana** remain weak in matters of truth, even though it is firmly established in the soul. Therefore, it is not long before **Kuhetu** (wrong reasons) and **Kudrishtaanta** (wrong examples) lead to the destruction of their **Samyaktva**.

Among these three types of **Samyagdarshana**, the shortest and longest duration of **Upashma Samyaktva** is one **Antarmukhurta** (a very short period of time). The shortest duration of **Kshayika Samyaktva** is one **Antarmukhurta**, and the longest duration is slightly less than two **Purva-koti** years (200 million years) and more than thirty-three **Sagar** (a vast period of time), compared to the duration of **Samsara** (the cycle of birth and death). Compared to the duration of **Moksha** (liberation), it is infinite. The shortest duration of **Vedaka Samyaktva** is one **Antarmukhurta**, and the longest duration is sixty-six **Sagar**.

This means that if a being attains **Aupashmika Samyagdarshana** and enters the fourth **Gunasthan** (state of being), its duration is only one **Antarmukhurta**. If it remains in the fourth **Gunasthan** with **Kshayika** or **Vedaka Samyagdarshana**, then it will remain in that state for the longest duration mentioned above for each of these two types.

**The Fifth Gunasthan: Desasanayat**

After attaining **Samyagdarshana**, when the **Apratyaakhyana Avarana** (veil of non-acceptance) of the four **Kshayas** (passions) - anger, pride, deceit, and greed - are destroyed or temporarily subdued, the being develops the desire to observe the **Shravaka Vratas** (vows of a lay follower). According to its capacity, it observes the vows of the eleven **Pratima** (stages) of a **Shravaka**.

Even though this **Gunasthan** has the desire to observe **Sakalasanyama** (complete restraint) - the complete observance of all virtues - it cannot do so due to the intense arising of the **Pratyaakhyana Avarana** (veil of non-acceptance). Therefore, it abandons the five **Papan** (sins) - violence, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, and attachment - for the rest of its life. It also observes the three **Gunas** (virtues) - **Digvrat** (vow of non-violence), **Deshavrat** (vow of non-attachment), and **Anarthadandavirat** (vow of non-acceptance of punishment).

It performs **Samayik** (meditation) for at least two **Ghadi** (48 minutes) every day during the three **Sandhyas** (twilight periods), meditating on the equality of all beings and abandoning attachment and aversion to pleasant and unpleasant things. It observes **Upavas** (fasting) on the eighth and fourteenth day of every fortnight, abstaining from food, water, and other activities, and dedicating the entire day and night to **Dharma Sadhana** (spiritual practice). It chooses only the essentials from food and daily necessities...

---------------------------
## Introduction
[11]

This being, having renounced all unnecessary things for life, still observes the rule of renouncing some things while keeping others, keeping in mind daily necessities. And regularly every day, he gives food to guests (sadhus, shravaks, or un-restrained samyagdrstis), gives medicine to the sick, gives knowledge to the inquisitive and students, and helps those who are afraid, orphans, and the weak, giving them protection. In short, this being, who has attained this guna-sthana, lives an ideal life of a noble citizen. The second name of this guna-sthana is "sanyatasanyata," because he is "sanyata" (restrained) due to completely renouncing violence towards mobile beings, and "asanyata" (unrestrained) due to not renouncing violence towards stationary beings. Thus, by possessing both forms of "sanyata" and "asanyata" at the same time, he is called "sanyatasanyata." This "sanyatasanyata" gradually reduces his "asanyata" nature and increases his "sanyata" nature, reaching the high level of the eleventh pratima, where his personal needs become minimal. He keeps only a kaupin (loincloth) for clothing, takes a prescribed diet, and leaves home and lives in sadhu abodes. The lowest time for this guna-sthana is an antarmukhurta, and the highest time is less than eight years, an antarmukhurta, a previous koti year. It is important to note here that a being who attains "sanyamasanyama" in the form of adopting the vows of a shravak with "upshama samyaktva," even if he does not attain "vedak" or "kshayik samyaktva" within an antarmukhurta, falls from this guna-sthana to lower guna-sthanas.

## The Sixth Guna-sthana: Pramattasanyata

The third division of "charitramohaniya," which is the "pratyakhyanavaran kshaya," when its "kshayopshama" occurs, the being adopts "sakalasanyama," meaning he renounces all forms of "savadyayoga," both subtle and gross - the five sins of violence, etc., through mind, speech, body, and through action, causing action, and approval, for life, and adopts the great vows. He renounces all external possessions, except for a kamandalu for purification, scriptures for knowledge, and peacock feathers for restraint. However, due to the arising of "sanjwalan" and "nokshaya," he experiences a state of "pramada." These "pramadas" are fifteen - four "vikathas," four "kshayas," five senses, one sleep, and one "pranaya" (affection). Due to the continuous occurrence of any of these fifteen types of "pramadas," the being in this guna-sthana is called "pramattasanyata." The lowest and highest time for this guna-sthana is an antarmukhurta. This means that the "pramattasanyata" sadhu, within an antarmukhurta, abandons his "pramatta" state and becomes "apramatta," becoming absorbed in contemplation of his own nature. However, contemplation of one's own nature is not permanent either, and as soon as the mind deviates from it, it again becomes transformed into some form of "pramada." Just as even when awake, the eyes...

---------------------------
## Chapter 12: The Six Realms

**The opening and closing of the eyes happens continuously, in the same way, the inward and outward tendencies of a Sadhu (saint) in the Gunasthanas (stages of spiritual progress) also continue.**

**7. The Aparamatta Samyata Gunasthan (Stage of Unwavering Restraint):** The inward tendency mentioned above is called Aparamatta Samyata. As long as the Sakalasamyami Sadhu (saint who has attained complete restraint) remains absorbed in the contemplation of the Atma (soul), he should be considered to be in the seventh Gunasthan. Although the duration of this Gunasthan is also only an Antarmuhurt (a very short period of time), it should be considered half the duration of the sixth Gunasthan by the gross mind. The reason for this is that no being can remain in the state of supreme Samadhi (meditation) for a long time while contemplating the Atma. In other words, the tendency of the Sadhu or the transformation of the mind changes every Antarmuhurt, and he moves from the sixth Gunasthan to the seventh and from the seventh to the sixth, and this cycle of transformation continues throughout his life. It is important to note here that those who attain Sakalasamyam (complete restraint) along with Upsham Samyaktva (right faith and conduct) and do not attain Vedak or Kshayik Samyaktva (right knowledge and liberation) after the duration of Upsham Samyaktva, they remain restrained for an Antarmuhurt and then fall from it and descend to lower Gunasthanas.

**Among the seventh Gunasthan Sadhus who maintain Sakalasamyam, there are some special individuals who strive to ascend to higher Gunasthanas. Those who make such an effort are called Satishya Aparamatta Samyata. These beings, while remaining in this Gunasthan, strive to attain specific results in the form of Adhakarana (lowering), Apurvakarana (making new), and Anivrittikarana (stopping) for the Upsham (subduing) or Kshaya (destruction) of Charitra Mohaniya Karma (karma that binds to the body). Among them, the attainment of Adhakarana results happens in the seventh Gunasthan itself. However, the attainment of specific Apurvakarana results happens in the eighth Gunasthan, and the attainment of specific Anivrittikarana results happens in the ninth Gunasthan.**

**1. Adhakarana Result:** When a being strives for the Upsham or Kshaya of Charitra Mohaniya Karma, his results, although becoming progressively pure over an Antarmuhurt, may resemble the results of a being who has attained Adhakarana results in the past. This is because there are countless varieties of these results. The first being, with the purity of the middle category, may attain the purity of a particular category in the third or fourth time period, while the second being may attain the same purity in the first time period. Therefore, the results of the first being resemble the results of the being who is in the lower time period, hence they are called Adhakarana results.

Page #26:
---------------------------
## Introduction
[13]
The point is that the results that can occur in the first time of one being, can also occur in the second time of another being, in the third time of a third being, and in the fourth time of a fourth being. Thus, the results of the superior co-existent beings are found in the descending time, resembling the results of the inferior co-existent beings. Although the results of each being who establishes this cause are progressively infinite in purity in the future times, yet their results may be similar or dissimilar to the results of other beings present in those same times. This is what should be known about the results of the beings who establish this cause behind it. As soon as the time of the inferior cause result ends, the time of the eight-fold, non-negligent, restrained-quality-state ends, and that being enters the eighth quality-state.

It should be known here that the next five quality-states are divided into two categories - one is the subsiding category and the other is the diminishing category. The being who strives for the subsidence of the obscuring karma ascends the subsiding category, and the being who strives for the destruction of karma ascends the diminishing category. There are four quality-states in the subsiding category - the eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh. There are also four quality-states in the diminishing category - the eighth, ninth, tenth, and twelfth. The least and the most time of both these categories is an inter-moment. And the time of each quality-state of each category is also an inter-moment. Further, the quality-states of both categories will be described together. One more thing worth knowing is that the perfect knowledge of the Vedas does not occur in the quality-states beyond the seventh. Therefore, it is necessary for any being who wants to ascend to hold the second subsidence perfect knowledge or the diminishing perfect knowledge here. The diminishing perfect knowledge being can ascend both categories, but the second subsidence perfect knowledge being can only ascend the subsiding category.

8. The Unprecedented Cause Restrained Quality-State - In the time of the descending cause, the present being does not subside or destroy any karma, but it increases with infinite purity every moment. Upon entering the eighth quality-state, the purity of its results becomes even more infinitely pure than the inferior cause. Such pure results were never obtained before, hence they are called unprecedented cause (results). Just as the results of different co-existent beings in the inferior cause are both similar and dissimilar, it is not so in the unprecedented cause. But here, the results of different co-existent beings are unprecedented, that is, they are dissimilar, not similar. From the first time of entering this quality-state, four actions begin for each being: 1. Quality-series-decay, 2. Quality-transition, 3. Position-section-destruction, and 4. Experience-section-destruction. Every moment...

##  The Six Stages of Liberation (Chhavakhandagam)

The gradual elimination of karma-regions in an infinite geometric series is called **guna-shreni-nirjara**. Here, the **guna-samkran** refers to the transition of karma-varganas, which are present in the existence of those who are not bound by the coarse natures, into other natures in the form of an infinite geometric series. The destruction of thousands of **kandakas** of existing karmas is called **sthiticandak-ghat**, and the destruction of thousands of **anubhag-kandakas** of the same karmas is called **anubhag-kandak-ghat**. By performing these four actions, the time of **apuurvakaran** ends. Although the being does not experience the subsidence or destruction of any karma in this **guna-sthana**, it does lighten its karma burden considerably through these four specific actions.

**9. The Guna-sthana of Anivrittikaran:** The **parinam** of the being entering this **guna-sthana** continues to increase with infinite purity every moment. Here, as in **apuurvakaran**, the aforementioned four actions take place. As a significant portion of the time of this **guna-sthana** passes, the being, having ascended the **upshama-shreni**, experiences the internalization of the twenty-one **moha-prakritis**, including the twelve **kashayas** like **apratyakhyana** and the nine **nokashayas**. **Antarakaran** refers to the deposition of the substance of the **nishekas** of the intermediate states, in the measure of an **antar-muhurta**, into the substance of the states above and below, leaving behind the **nishekas** of the intended location. After **antarakaran**, the **upshamaka** being first subsides the **napumsak-veda**, then the **stri-veda**, followed by the six **nokashayas** and the **purusha-veda**. Subsequently, it subsides the eight **madhyama-kashayas**, including the **apratyakhyana-avaran-chatuṣka** and the **pratyakhyana-avaran-chatuṣka**. Then, it subsides **sanjvalana**, **krodha**, **mana**, **maya**, and **badar-lobha** in sequence, ending the time of the ninth **guna-sthana**. However, the being that has ascended the **kshapka-shreni** and entered this **guna-sthana**, after a significant portion of the ninth **guna-sthana** has passed, first destroys the sixteen **prakritis**, including **1. styanagridhi**, **2. nidranidra**, **3. prachalaprachala**, **4. narak-gati**, **5. narak-gati-anupurvi**, **6. tiryan-gati**, **7. tiryan-gati-anupurvi**, **8. ekendriya-jati**, **9. dwiendriya-jati**, **10. triendriya-jati**, **11. chaturindriya-jati**, **12. aatap**, **13. udyot**, **14. sthavar**, **15. sukshma**, and **16. sadharan**. Then, it destroys the eight **madhyama-kashayas**. Subsequently, it internalizes the four **sanjvalanas** and the nine **nokashayas**, first destroying the **napumsak-veda**, then the **stri-veda**, followed by the six **nokashayas** and the **purusha-veda**. Finally, it destroys **sanjvalana**, **krodha**, **mana**, **maya**, and **badar-lobha** in sequence, ending the time of the ninth **guna-sthana**.

**10. The Guna-sthana of Sukshma-Samparaya:** This **guna-sthana** is called **sukshma-samparaya** because **sukshma-lobha-kashaya**, the subtle **lobha-kashaya**, is present here. The being that has ascended the **upshama-shreni** and arrived here experiences the **vedana** (experience) of subtle **lobha** for an **antar-muhurta** and, in the final moments, ...

Preface
[15] He also calms it down and enters the eleventh gunasthana. However, the one who has climbed the ksapaka-sreni and attained this gunasthana, experiences subtle lobha (greed) for a moment and at every moment, while undergoing nirjara (shedding) of its dravya (matter) in the form of an innumerable series, finally destroys it and enters the twelfth gunasthana.

11 Upasanta-moha-gunasthana - In this gunasthana, all the prakritis (types) of the deluding karmas of the present living being have become pacified, so he is called upasanta-moha or upasanta-kasaya. Just as the muddiness of dirty water becomes pacified by putting kataka (nirmali) fruit or alum in it, and the water becomes absolutely clear, or just as the water of a lake becomes absolutely clear in the autumn season by the settling down of the muddiness, similarly, due to the complete pacification of the moha-karma, absolute purity comes in the dispositions of the living being of this gunasthana, and while remaining a chadmastha (with limited knowledge), he attains the yathakhyata-charitra (right conduct as per one's knowledge) and attains the vitaraga-sanjña (state of detachment). However, as soon as the time limit of this gunasthana expires, the pacified kasayas come back into manifestation, and he falls back from the eleventh gunasthana to the lower gunasthanas.

12 Ksina-moha-gunasthana - The living being who has destroyed the subtle lobha at the end of the tenth gunasthana while climbing the ksapaka-sreni, reaches the twelfth gunasthana directly from the tenth, as all his moha (delusion) has been completely destroyed, and while remaining a chadmastha, he attains the yathakhyata-charitra and attains the vitaraga-sanjña. The duration of this gunasthana is also a moment. When two moments are left in that time, he simultaneously destroys the two karmas of nidra (sleep) and pracala (trembling). Thereafter, in the last moment, he simultaneously destroys the fourteen prakritis - the five of jnanavaraniya (knowledge-obscuring), the remaining four of darsanavaraniya (perception-obscuring), and the five of antaraya (obstacle-creating) karmas, and becomes omniscient and omnipercipient, entering the thirteenth gunasthana.

13 Sayogi-kevali-gunasthana - At the end of the tenth gunasthana, the complete destruction of the moha-karma, and at the end of the twelfth gunasthana, the complete destruction of the jnanavaraniya, darsanavaraniya, and antaraya karmas, has resulted in the manifestation of the nine attainments (labhdhis) - the ksayika (annihilative) anantajnana (infinite knowledge), anantadarshana (infinite perception), anantasukha (infinite bliss), anantaveerya (infinite energy), anantachatustaya (four infinities), as well as the ksayika samyaktva (right faith), ksayika dana (charity), ksayika labha (gain), ksayika bhoga (enjoyment), and ksayika upabhoga (consumption). And the cluster of rays of the sun of kevala-jnana (omniscience) has completely destroyed the darkness of ignorance. Therefore, those who have attained the supreme state, who are called sayogi (with yoga) because they possess yoga, and kevali (omniscient) because they possess the unsupported kevala-jnana and kevala-darshana, such Arihanta Parameshthi (supreme ascetics) manifest the state of omniscience and omniperspicience in this gunasthana. These sayogi-kevali Bhagavans do not destroy even a single karma; rather, the remaining...

**[16]**
The six-fold aghatiya karma, excluding the ayukarma, are the name, gotra, and vedaniya karma. These three karma, with their infinite number of particles, are gradually destroyed by the soul in each moment of time, while it continues to wander in the world for the duration of its life, preaching dharma to all beings. The minimum duration of this gunasthan is an antarmukhurta, and the maximum duration is less than one purva-koti years, but more than eight years and an antarmukhurta.

**[14] A-yogik-kevali Gunasthan:** When the above-mentioned sayogik-kevali jinas have only an antarmukhurta of life remaining, they enter this gunasthan by becoming a-yogik-kevali, having abandoned yoga. Due to the absence of yoga, their kariv is completely absent, and therefore they are completely free from new karma-bandha. They are also on the verge of the destruction of all existing karma. They become masters of the eighteen thousand types of sheel, and they also attain the fullness of eighty-four lakh uttar gunas. Due to the absence of yoga, their atma-pradeshas become completely still, and they attain a state of stillness, stability, and peace, like a mountain (shail). The duration of this gunasthan is only a small antarmukhurta, the time it takes to pronounce the five short vowels: a, i, u, ri, and l. When two moments of time remain in this gunasthan, these a-yogik-kevali jinas destroy, simultaneously, seventy-two types of vedaniya karma, in both their prakritis, through anudaya: devagati, five bodies, five sanghatas, five bandhas, six sansthans, three ango-pangas, six sanhananas, five varna, two gandhas, five rasas, eight sparshas, devagati-anupurvi, aguru-laghu, upghat, parvat, uchchhas, prashasta-vihayogati, aprashasta-vihayogati, aparyapt, pratyek-sharira, sthira, asthira, shubha, ashubha, durbhaga, duhsvara, susvara, anadeya, ayasha-kirti, nirman, and nich-gotra. Then, in the final moment, they destroy thirteen types of vedaniya karma through udaya: manushya-ayu, manushya-gati, panchendriya-jati, manushya-gati-anupurvi, tras, badar, paryapt, subhaga, adeya, yasha-kirti, uchch-gotra, and if the soul is of tirthankara prakriti, then it also destroys the prakriti of tirthankara. After destroying these thirteen types of vedaniya karma, they leave their present body, become free from all karma, and attain nirvana, becoming a siddha parmatma and residing in the siddhalaya, forever free from the cycle of birth and death.

Through these fourteen gunasthans, the samsari atma removes the coverings of raga, dvesha, moha, and other emotions, develops itself, and becomes a parmatma.

**Marganasthan:** The word marganasthan means "to search" (stroj). Therefore, the places where jivas are searched for, through naraka, etc., and through special dharmas like jnana, etc., are called marganasthans. There are fourteen marganasthans: 1) Gati, 2) Indriya, ...

3 Kāya, 4 Yoga, 5 Veda, 6 Kaṣāya, 7 Jñāna, 8 Samyama, 9 Darśana, 10 Leśyā, 11 Bhavyatva, 12 Samyaktva, 13 Saṁjñitva and 14 Āhāra Mārgṇā.

1 **Gati Mārgṇā** - The movement from one existence to another is called Gati. Or, the specific action of the Jīva arising from the उदय of the Karma called Gati, i.e., the transformation into the form of a Naraka, Tiryañc, etc., is called Gati. There are four types of Gati - Narakagati, Tiryañcgati, Manuşyagati and Devagati. All beings in the universe reside in these four Gatis. Those who are liberated from the cycle of Samsara are called Siddhas and they reside in Siddhalaya, which is called the fifth Siddhagati. Thus, through Gati Mārgṇā, all beings are investigated or known.

2 **Indriya Mārgṇā** - Indriya refers to the specific power, Linga or sign that indicates the existence of the Ātma. Due to the specific क्षयोपशम of the Jñāna Avarana Karma, there are five types of Indriyas in Samsari Jīvas based on the difference in their ability to perceive their respective objects - touch, taste, smell, color and sound - namely, Sparśa Indriya, Rasa Indriya, Ghrana Indriya, Cakṣu Indriya and Śrotra Indriya. Due to the उदय of the Jāti Karma, those Jīvas who have only the Sparśa Indriya are called Ekendriya Jīvas, such as earth, water, fire, air and plant-bodied beings. Those who have two Indriyas - Sparśa and Rasa - are called Dvīndriya Jīvas, such as worms, earthworms, etc. Those who have three Indriyas - Sparśa, Rasa and Ghrana - are called Trīndriya Jīvas, such as insects, spiders, bedbugs, lice, etc. Those who have four Indriyas - Sparśa, Rasa, Ghrana and Cakṣu - are called Caturindriya Jīvas, such as bumblebees, flies, mosquitoes, etc. Those who have all five Indriyas are called Pañcendriya Jīvas, such as humans, gods, Narakas, cows, buffaloes, etc., and pigeons, peacocks, swans, etc. Among the Pañcendriya Jīvas, some Tiryañcgati Jīvas have a mind and some do not. Those who have a mind are called Saṁjñī and those who do not are called Asaṁjñī. Thus, all beings in the universe are collected or investigated through these five Indriyas. Those who are devoid of contact with the Indriyas are called Ateeindriya, such as Siddhas.

3 **Kāya Mārgṇā** - The body, which is a mass of Pudgala in the form of Audārika, etc., accumulated due to the Yogarūpa tendency of the Ātma, is called Kāya. Due to the उदय of the Tras and Sthāvara Karma, all living beings are divided into two parts - Traskāyika and Sthāvarakāyika. The five Ekendriya Jīvas, such as earth-bodied, etc., are called Sthāvarakāyika, and the Dvīndriya, Trīndriya, Caturindriya and Pañcendriya Jīvas are called Traskāyika. Those Jīvas who have become liberated by the क्षय of Karma are to be known as Akāyika Jīvas.

Chakkhandagama 4 Yogamargana- The arising of the power that is the cause of the acceptance of karmas due to the activity of the self in the form of contraction and expansion is called yoga. Or, the activity in the form of contraction and expansion of the regions of the self is called yoga. There are three types of yoga - manoyoga, vachanayoga, and kaayayoga. The arising of the mental state that is the cause of the contemplation of the nature of the object is called manoyoga. The yoga that is the cause of the arising of speech is called vachanayoga, and the effort that is for the arising of the activity of the body is called kaayayoga. Out of these three yogas, only kaayayoga is found in the ekendriyas (one-sensed beings). Vachanayoga and kaayayoga are found in the beings from the dwindriya (two-sensed) to the asanjni panchendriyas (unconscious five-sensed beings). All three yogas are found in the sanjni panchendriyas (conscious five-sensed beings). In this way, through these three yogas, all the beings up to the thirteenth gunasthana (stage of spiritual development) attain anumargana (spiritual progress). The ayogikevali (non-yogic omniscient) and the siddha (liberated) beings who are devoid of these yogas should be known as ayogi (non-yogic).
5 Vedamargana- The bhava (state of being) of enjoying the objects of women, men, or both, which arises due to the rise of the vedaniya (feeling-deluding) karma that is veda, is called veda. There are three types of veda - striveda, puruṣaveda, and napuṃsakaveda. The desire of women to enjoy with men is called striveda. The desire of men to enjoy with women is called puruṣaveda. The desire to enjoy with both women and men is called napuṃsakaveda. Or, the bhava of enjoying with any living being or its limbs and appendages, which is different from the desire of the aforementioned two vedas, is called napuṃsakaveda. All the beings from the ekendriyas to the asanjni panchendriyas are only napuṃsakavedi. Among the sanjni panchendriyas, there are beings with all three vedas. Among them, the narakis (hell beings) have only napuṃsakaveda, and the devas (celestial beings) have either striveda or puruṣaveda. In the manushyas (humans) and the sanjni panchendriyas, there are beings with all three vedas. These three vedas are found up to the saveda (with veda) part of the ninth gunasthana, and the remaining gunasthanas of the manushyas and the siddhas should be known as avedi (without veda).
6 Kaṣāyamārgaṇā- That which pulls the karmic field that generates happiness and unhappiness and does not allow the arising of samyagdarśana (right faith), saṃyamasaṃyama (partial control), sakalasamyama (complete control), and yathākhyātacaritra (conduct as per knowledge), is called kaṣāya. There are four types of kaṣāya - krodha (anger), māna (pride), māyā (deceit), and lobha (greed). These four kaṣāyas are found in all the living beings from the smallest ekendriyas to the panchendriyas of the four gatis (realms of existence). Even the beings who are developing the self have these four kaṣāyas up to the ninth gunasthana. In the ninth gunasthana, the kaṣāyas of krodha, māna, and māyā are destroyed. The kaṣāya of lobha is found up to the tenth gunasthana, and it is destroyed at the end of that. Above this, the beings of the eleventh and the subsequent four gunasthanas, as well as the siddhas, are akṣāya, i.e., devoid of kaṣāya.

Preface
[19]
It is necessary to know. In this way, the search of all living beings is done through the marga.na of kasaya.
7 Jnanamargena - That by which the nature of the object is known, is called knowledge. There are five types of knowledge - abhinibodhika jnana (mati-jnana), srutajnana, avadhi-jnana, manaḥparyaya-jnana and kevala-jnana. The knowledge that arises with the help of the senses and the mind, when the regular object is present, is called abhinibodhika-jnana. Srutajnana is the knowledge of a different substance, taking refuge in the object known by abhinibodhika-jnana. For example, knowing the fire in the kitchen, etc. by seeing the smoke coming out of a place, and knowing the fire as the cause of the sound of the smoke. Avadhi-jnana is the direct knowledge of the objects of form without the help of the senses, taking into account the substance, space, time and state. Manaḥparyaya-jnana is the knowledge of the thoughts that were thought in the past, are present in the mind at present, and will be thought in the future. Kevala-jnana is the knowledge that directly and simultaneously knows all the substances of the three worlds and the infinite qualities and modifications of the three times. Of these, the first three knowledges are also false, which are called mati-ajnana, srutajnana and vibhangajnana respectively. The mati, sruta and avadhi-jnana that occur in the first three gunasthanas of the worldly beings before the arising of right faith should be known as false knowledge. The knowledge that occurs from the fourth gunasthana onwards is all right knowledge. Manaḥparyaya-jnana occurs from the sixth gunasthana to the twelfth gunasthana. Kevala-jnana occurs in the thirteenth, fourteenth gunasthanas and in the Siddhas.
8 Samyamamargana - Observing the five great vows, practicing the five samitis, restraining the passions like anger, renouncing the three danda (of mind, speech and body), and conquering the objects of the five senses is called samyama. There are five types of samyama - samayika, chedopasthapana, pariharavisuddhi, sukshmasamparaya, yathakhyata. In addition to these, desasamyama and asamyama also come under this marga.na. Abandoning all sinful activities and observing one undivided samyama is samayika-samyama. Observing the same undivided samyama in the form of two, three, four, five great vows is chedopasthapana-samyama. The sadhana in which one lives in the householder's life for thirty years, enjoys all kinds of pleasures according to one's desire, and then takes the diksha of a muni and lives at the feet of the Tirthankara for a period of time (three years or less) and studies the pratikramana well, is called pariharavisuddhi-samyama. In this type of sadhana, the activities of going, coming, eating, living and sleeping etc. do not cause any harm to the living being. The samyama that is observed in this way, either in an undivided form or in a divided form, is called pariharavisuddhi-samyama. The samyama in which all the passions are destroyed is called sukshmasamparaya-samyama. The samyama in which the ascetic has completely destroyed all the passions and has attained the state of yathakhyata is called yathakhyata-samyama.

##  Chapter 20: 

**Samyama Margna**

**Samyama** refers to the practice of restraint. There are different types of Samyama:

* **Sookshma Samparaya Samyama:** This is the restraint practiced by a Sadhu who has attained the tenth Gunasthan, where only a subtle trace of greed remains.
* **Yathakyat Samyama:** This is the restraint characterized by the complete absence of Kshayas (negative emotions), leading to a state of Vitaraga (freedom from attachment).
* **Desha Samyama:** This refers to the observance of vows by a Shravak (lay follower).
* **Asamyama:** This refers to the absence of any restraint. The first four Gunasthanas are characterized by Asamyama.

Desha Samyama is practiced in the fifth Gunasthan. Samayik and Chhedopasthapana Samyama are practiced from the sixth to the ninth Gunasthan. Sookshma Samparaya Samyama is practiced in the tenth Gunasthan. Yathakyat Samyama is practiced from the eleventh to the fourteenth Gunasthan.

The process of investigating the nature of Jivas (souls) through Samyama is called **Samyama Margna**.

**Darshan Margna**

**Darshan** refers to the perception of reality. It involves perceiving the general aspect of an object without focusing on its specific details. Alternatively, it can be defined as the self-awareness that arises when the soul strives to understand an object. There are four types of Darshan:

* **Chakshu Darshan:** This refers to the perception of objects through the sense of sight.
* **Achakshu Darshan:** This refers to the perception of objects through senses other than sight, including the mind.
* **Avadhi Darshan:** This refers to the perception of objects through Avadhi Jnana (clairvoyance), which involves a general understanding of the object before the actual experience.
* **Kevala Darshan:** This refers to the perception of all objects in the three realms (Triloka) across all three times (past, present, future) through Kevala Jnana (omniscience).

Achakshu Darshan is practiced from the first to the twelfth Gunasthan. Chakshu Darshan is practiced from the fourth to the twelfth Gunasthan. Avadhi Darshan is practiced from the fourth to the twelfth Gunasthan. Kevala Darshan is practiced by Jivas in the thirteenth and fourteenth Gunasthan, as well as by Siddhas (liberated souls).

The process of investigating the nature of Jivas through Darshan is called **Darshan Margna**.

**Leshya Margna**

**Leshya** refers to the tendency of the soul to be influenced by Kshayas. There are six types of Leshya:

* **Krishna Leshya:** This is characterized by intense anger, a desire for revenge, a combative nature, a lack of compassion, and a tendency towards cruelty.
* **Neela Leshya:** This is characterized by greed, deceitfulness, laziness, a lack of intelligence, a strong desire for wealth, and a tendency to cheat others.
* **Kapota Leshya:** This is characterized by a tendency to get angry easily, a tendency to criticize others and praise oneself, a lack of trust in others, a tendency to give gifts to those who flatter or praise them, and a lack of concern for one's own well-being.

These three Leshyas are considered **Ashubha Leshyas** (unfavorable Leshyas).

* **Peet Leshya (Tejo Leshya):** This is characterized by a concern for one's own well-being, a tendency towards compassion and generosity, an impartial view of others, and a gentle nature.
* **Padma Leshya:** This is characterized by a noble nature, a tendency towards renunciation, and a lack of concern for suffering and adversity.
* **Shukla Leshya:** This is characterized by a pure and virtuous nature, a complete absence of Kshayas, and a state of liberation.

The process of investigating the nature of Jivas through Leshya is called **Leshya Margna**.

## Introduction
[21]
Holding forgiveness even when wronged, serving the gurus, and following vows and conduct are signs of the black *leshya*. Not being partial to anyone, not having attachment or aversion, keeping one's tendencies calm, remaining constantly cheerful, serving Dharma without seeking results (fruits), and having equanimity towards all beings are signs of the white *leshya*. From the first to the fourth *guna-sthana*, beings have all six *leshyas* as much as possible. Further, from the seventh *guna-sthana* onwards, three auspicious *leshyas* like yellow are found, and from the eighth to the thirteenth *guna-sthana*, there is the white *leshya*. Beings in the fourteenth *guna-sthana* and the liberated beings are called *aleshya* because they are free from the stain of *leshyas*. Thus, the investigation of beings through *leshyas* is called *leshya-margana*.

##  *Bhavya-tva-margana*
[11] Those beings who have the potential to attain liberation, who are destined to manifest the qualities of right faith, etc., within themselves when the opportunity arises, are called *bhavya*. However, there are also some beings in the world who, even when given the best external opportunities, will never develop their inner qualities, nor will they ever attain right faith, etc. They are called *abhavya*. *Abhavya* beings have only the first *guna-sthana* of wrong faith, and they cannot rise above it or attain liberation. *Bhavya* beings have all the *guna-sthana*. Liberated beings are free from the categories of *bhavya* and *abhavya*. Thus, through this *margana*, all beings are investigated.

## *Samyak-tva-margana*
[12] Right faith is called *samyak-tva*. The objects of right faith are the *apta*, the *agama*, and the *padartha*. Firm faith, interest, or conviction in these is called right faith. This is a characteristic in relation to the practical approach. In relation to the definitive approach, right faith is defined as the experience of the true nature of the soul by turning the outward gaze inward, recognizing the soul as distinct from all other objects, and becoming established in that experience. There are three types of right faith: *aupashamika samyak-tva*, *kshayika samyak-tva*, and *kshayopashamika* or *vedaka samyak-tva*. The nature of these three has been explained earlier. *Aupashamika samyak-tva* is found from the fourth to the eleventh *guna-sthana*. *Kshayopashamika* is found from the fourth to the seventh *guna-sthana*, and *kshayika samyak-tva* is found in beings from the fourth to the fourteenth *guna-sthana* and in the liberated beings. Those whose right faith is lost due to the arising of the *karma* of wrong faith, and whose faith is mixed with both right faith and wrong faith, are called *samyak-mithya-drishti*. Such beings have the third *guna-sthana*. Those whose right faith has been destroyed by the arising of the *kashya* of infinite attachment, but who have not yet reached the *guna-sthana* of wrong faith, are called *sasadan-samyak-drishti*. They have the second *guna-sthana*. Beings who have the arising of the *karma* of wrong faith are called *mithya-drishti*. They have the first *guna-sthana*. Thus, the nature of right faith...

##  Chapter 22:

**22]  ** Examining the beings of the three worlds by taking refuge in the six-part scripture is called **Samyaktvamargna**.

**13]  **  **Sanjnimaargna** - The destruction or pacification of the karma of the nine sense organs (mind) or the knowledge arising from it is called **Sanjna**. Beings who possess this type of **Sanjna** are called **Sanjnis**, those who receive education, action, speech (words) and teachings. Beings who do not possess this type of **Sanjna** are called **Asanjnis**. All beings from one sense organ to four sense organs are **Asanjnis**. Among the five sense organs, all beings in the realms of gods, humans, and hell are **Sanjnis**. Among the five sense organs in the animal realm, some aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial beings do not have a mind, they should also be known as **Asanjnis**. **Asanjnis** have only one **Mithyatva**  **Gunasthan**. **Sanjnis** have twelve **Gunasthanas** from the first to the twelfth. **Sayogikevali**, **Ayogikevali**, and **Siddh Bhagwan** should be known as **Sanjnis** and **Asanjnis** in the past or future. Thus, examining the beings by **Sanjna** and **Asanjna** is called **Sanjnimaargna**.

**14]  ** **Ahaarmargna** - The acceptance of the three bodies (Audarik, etc.) and the six perfections, which are the appropriate **Nokarmavargna**, is called **Ahaar**. Beings who accept this type of **Ahaar** are called **Ahaaraks**, and those who do not accept this type of **Ahaar** are called **Anahaaraks**. When a being leaves one body and goes to another realm to accept another body, if it has to take a turn (**Vigrah**) in between, then it will be in the state of **Anahaar**. In this **Vigrah** motion, a being remains **Anahaar** for one time if it takes one turn, for two times if it takes two turns, and for three times if it takes three turns. After that, it becomes **Ahaar** regularly. When **Kevali Bhagwan** performs **Kevali Samuddhat**, they also remain **Anahaar** for three times in the ascending and descending **Pratar Samuddhat** and in the **Lokpooran Samuddhat**. Except for these mentioned beings, all other worldly beings should be known as **Ahaaraks**. **Ayogikevali** and **Siddh** beings are also **Anahaaraks**. The state of **Anahaar** in **Vigrah** motion occurs in the first, second, and fourth **Gunasthanas**. **Kevali Bhagwan's** **Kevali Samuddhat** occurs at the end of the thirteenth **Gunasthan**. Thus, examining all the beings of the three worlds in the form of **Ahaar** and **Anahaar** is called **Ahaarmargna**.

**1]  ** **Satpraroopna** - The subject of **Satpraroopna** is **Sat**, which means existence. Where and how do beings exist in the three worlds? Answering this question is the subject of **Satpraroopna**. The answer to the above question is given in **Satpraroopna** in two ways - by **Ogh** and by **Aadesh**. **Ogh** is the name of the general, brief, or **Gunasthan**, and **Aadesh** is the name of the detailed, specific, or **Margna** place. The answer to the above question...

## Translation:

**23**

If the answer is given briefly, it is that all living beings in the three worlds (Trilōkavartī) reside in fourteen Gunasthānas. And those who have escaped from the cycle of birth and death (Samsāra-Paribhramaṇa) are the Siddha beings who reside in the Siddhalaya. If the answer to the above question is given in detail, it is that they reside in fourteen Mārgṇā-sthānas. Each Mārgṇā, through its internal sub-divisions, provides a more detailed answer to the question, as explained in the introduction to the Mārgṇās like Gati, etc.

**Introduction**

At the beginning of the text, Ācārya Puṣpadanta, after the auspicious invocation (Mangalācaraṇa), has indicated that the fourteen Mārgṇās, starting with Gati, are to be known for the purpose of understanding the categories of living beings (Jīvasamāsas). And for their characterization, he has stated that the eight Anuyogadvāras, starting with Sat, are to be known, and has mentioned their names. This statement relates to all the states of living beings. After this, in the eighth sūtra, he has indicated the description through Oga and Ādeśa, and from the ninth sūtra to the twenty-third sūtra, he has mentioned the names of the fourteen Gunasthānas and has indicated the Siddhas. The meaning of this is that if the characterization of the existence of living beings is to be given briefly, it is that they reside in fourteen Gunasthānas, and besides them, there are also Siddha beings. After this, from the twenty-fourth sūtra to the one hundred and seventy-seventh sūtra, the existence of living beings has been described in detail through Ādeśa. We have already given a glimpse of this in the introduction to the Mārgṇās, and for detailed information, one should refer to the Sat-prūpaṇā Anuyogadvāra of the present text.

**2. Sankhyā-prūpaṇā or Dravya-pramāṇānugam**

The name of the second Anuyogadvāra is Sankhyā-prūpaṇā or Dravya-pramāṇānugam. This Anuyogadvāra explains the total number of living beings and the number of living beings in each Gunasthāna and Mārgṇā-sthāna. The number of living beings is explained in four ways: in terms of Dravya, Kṣetra, Kāla, and Bhāva. It is essential for those who study this Sankhyā-prūpaṇā to understand the nature of Dravya, Kṣetra, etc., otherwise, the subject matter described in this prūpaṇā will not be understood. Therefore, a brief description of them is given here.

**1. Dravya-pramāṇ:** The count or number of the fundamental substance (Dravya) is called Dravya-pramāṇ. It has three divisions: Sankhyāta, Asankhyāta, and Ananta. That which can be expressed by numbers like two, three, four, etc., is called Sankhyāta. That quantity which is so large that it cannot be expressed by numbers is called Asankhyāta. That quantity which is much larger than this and whose limit is endless is called Ananta. Of these, the Sankhyāta quantity is the object of our senses, we can count it by numerical calculation and can refer to it by specific names through words. Therefore, it is the object of Śruta-jñāna. But we can neither express the Asankhyāta quantity through words nor...

Page #37:
---------------------------
[24]
This quantity can only be counted by numbers. This is the subject of avadhi-jnana (limited knowledge). The infinite quantity is the subject of kevala-jnana (omniscience) of the Omniscient, which no one else can know.

Chhakkhandagama

Among these, there are three types of numbers - jāghanya (minimum), madhyama (medium), and utkrṣṭa (maximum). Although the origin of counting is considered to be one, it only indicates the existence of the substance, not the distinction. The indication of distinction begins from two, therefore, two is considered the origin of number. Because neither adding one to one nor multiplying one by one causes any loss or increase in the number. Thus, the jāghanya number is two. By subtracting one from the jāghanya parita-saṃkhyāta, the measure of the utkrṣṭa number is obtained. All the numbers found between the jāghanya and utkrṣṭa should be known as the madhyama saṃkhyāta.

There are three types of asaṃkhyāta - parita-saṃkhyāta, yukta-saṃkhyāta, and asaṃkhyātā-saṃkhyāta. All three of these have three types each - jāghanya, madhyama, and utkrṣṭa. To know the measure of the jāghanya parita-saṃkhyāta, one should refer to the procedure described in Trilokasāra, verses 14 to 35, of creating four mahākuḍas named anavastā, śalākā, pratiśalākā, and mahāśalākā, filling them with mustard seeds, and then emptying and refilling them. By subtracting one from the jāghanya yukta-saṃkhyāta mentioned later, the measure of the utkrṣṭa parita-saṃkhyāta is obtained. All the numbers found between the jāghanya and utkrṣṭa parita-saṃkhyāta should be known as the madhyama parita-saṃkhyāta.

By squaring and cubing the jāghanya parita-saṃkhyāta, the measure of the jāghanya yukta-saṃkhyāta is obtained. By subtracting one from the jāghanya asaṃkhyātā-saṃkhyāta mentioned later, the measure of the utkrṣṭa yukta-saṃkhyāta is obtained. All the numbers found between the two should be known as the madhyama yukta-saṃkhyāta. By squaring the jāghanya yukta-saṃkhyāta, the measure of the jāghanya asaṃkhyātā-saṃkhyāta is obtained. By subtracting one from the jāghanya paritānanta mentioned later, the measure of the utkrṣṭa asaṃkhyātā-saṃkhyāta is obtained. The numbers found between the two should be known as the madhyama asaṃkhyātā-saṃkhyāta.

By cubing the jāghanya asaṃkhyātā-saṃkhyāta three times, the resulting quantity should be added with the number of pradeśas (spatial units) of dharma-dravya, adharma-dravya, one jīva, and lokākāśa, as well as the measure of the apratiṣṭhita and sapratiṣṭhita vanaspati, and then the resulting quantity should be cubed three times again. The resulting quantity should include the measure of the kalpakāla (cosmic time period), sthiti-bandha-adhyavasāya-sthānas (stages of duration-karma bondage), anubhāga-bandha-adhyavasāya-sthānas (stages of fruition-karma bondage), and the measure of the utkriṣṭa avibhāga-praticchedas (indivisible units) of yoga, and this final quantity is called the jāghanya paritānanta.

## Introduction

[25]

This section discusses the concept of "Paryatananta" (infinite numbers) in Jain philosophy. It explains the different types of Paryatananta, starting with the lowest (Jghanya) and progressing to the highest (Utkrishta).

**Jghanya Muktananta:** This is the lowest type of Paryatananta. It is obtained by multiplying the lowest type of Yuktananta (another type of infinite number) by itself.

**Jghanya Yuktananta:** This is obtained by subtracting one from the lowest type of Anantananta (another type of infinite number). The intermediate types between Jghanya Yuktananta and Utkrishta Yuktananta are called Madhyama Yuktananta.

**Jghanya Anantananta:** This is obtained by squaring the Jghanya Yuktananta. To obtain the Utkrishta Anantananta, this Jghanya Anantananta is squared three times, then multiplied by the six fundamental entities (Siddhjiva, Nigodaraashi, Vanaspatiraashi, Pudgalaraashi, Kaala, and Alokaakasha). This resulting number is then squared three times again, and then multiplied by the indivisible parts of the Dharma and Adharma substances (Agurulalghu guna). This final number is then squared three times again, and then subtracted by the number of Kevalgyan (perfect knowledge). The remaining number is then added to the number of Kevalgyan. This final number is the Utkrishta Anantananta. The intermediate types between Jghanya Anantananta and Utkrishta Anantananta are called Madhyama Anantananta.

**Dravya Pramaan:** This method of understanding the infinite numbers is called Dravya Pramaan, as it uses the concept of substances (Dravya) to understand the infinite numbers.

**Kaala Pramaan:** This is another method of understanding the infinite numbers, using the concept of time (Kaala). The smallest unit of time is called "Samaya". It is the time taken by an atom to travel from one point in space to another at the slowest possible speed. A "Yukta-Samkhyat-Pramaan" is a collection of Samaya. A collection of Yukta-Samkhyat-Pramaan is called "Uchchhas" or "Praan". Seven Uchchhas make a "Stok", seven Stoks make a "Lav", and 38.5 Lavs make a "Naali". Two Naalis make a "Muhurt", and 30 Muhurts make an "Ahoratra" or "Divas" (day). According to the current system of time calculation, a day is considered to be 24 hours. Based on this, the table of time units is as follows:

Ahoratra = 30 Muhurt
24 Hours = Muhurt = 2 Naali
48 Minutes = Naali = 38.5 Lav
24 Minutes = Lav = 7 Stok
377 Seconds = Stok = 7 Uchchhas
5665 Seconds = Uchchhas (Praan) = Samkhyat Aavali
348 Seconds

## Chapter 26: The Sixfold Division of Time

**Avali**

The time taken for a single atom to travel from one point in space to another at the slowest possible speed is known as an **Avali**.

The time taken for a healthy human to inhale and exhale once is called an **Uchchhas**. There are 3773 Uchchhas in a **Muhurt** (a unit of time). This is calculated as follows: 243834747 / 3773 = 1.

There are 3773 x 43 = 1,13,190 Uchchhas in a day (24 hours). This translates to approximately 3443.786 Uchchhas per minute, which aligns with modern calculations.

A **Bhinna Muhurt** is a shorter duration than a Muhurt. An even shorter duration is known as an **Antarmuhurt**. Some Acharyas consider Bhinna Muhurt and Antarmuhurt to be synonymous.

Adding a unit of time to the Avali period results in the **Sarva Jghanya Antarmuhurt**.  To reach the **Utkrishta Antarmuhurt**, one must progressively add units of time, understanding the intermediate **Madhyama Antarmuhurt** (the average Antarmuhurt).

**Time Divisions**

* 15 days = 1 Paksha
* 2 Pakshas = 1 Maas
* 2 Maasas = 1 Ritu
* 3 Ritus = 1 Ayan
* 2 Ayans = 1 Varsh (year)
* 5 Varshas = 1 Yug
* 84 lakh Varshas = 1 Purvaang
* 84 lakh Purvaangs = 1 Purva

Further multiplying by 84 lakh repeatedly results in various numerical units like **Nyutaang-Nyut, Kumudaang-Kumud, Panmaang-Padm, Nalinaang-Nalin, Kamalaang-Kamal, Trutitaang-Trutut, Atttaang-Attat, Ammaang-Amm, Hahaang-Haha, Huhaang-Huuhu, Laataang-Lata, and Mahalaataang-Mahalata**. All these units fall under the category of **Madhyama Sankhyat**.

**Note:** The numerical units mentioned above (Nyutaang etc.) have no relevance in the natural world. However, the present text utilizes numerical units like **Purva Kodi and Koda Kodi**.

**Further Time Divisions**

* 1 crore Purva years = 1 Purva Koti years
* The maximum lifespan of humans and animals on earth is considered to be 1 Purva Koti years.
* The square of 1 Koti is called **Koda Kodi**.
* The numerical unit between Koti and Koda Kodi is called **Antah Koda Kodi**.

The present text utilizes these three numerical units and their related units like **Koda Koda Kodi**.

**Further Details**

The text further mentions the construction of a pond with dimensions of 1 Mahayojan (2000 Kos) in length, width, and depth. This pond is filled with the best type of soil and is said to be filled with the milk of a goat born within 7 days of its birth.

## Introduction
[27
Whose hair follicles are filled with Roman numerals and cannot be cut with scissors. Again, one hair follicle is taken out of that pond after every hundred years. The time it takes to remove all these hair follicles is called Vyavaharapalya. Multiplying this Vyavaharapalya by countless koti years gives the measure of Uddharapalya. By this, the number of islands and oceans is calculated. Multiplying this Uddharapalya by countless koti years gives the measure of Adhapalya. In the scriptures, the description of karma, bhava, lifespan, and the state of the body is done with this Adhapalya. That is, wherever the word 'Palyopama' comes, it should be understood as the measure of time of Adhapalya. This number system uses this Palyopama. Ten Kodakodi Adhapalyopama is one Adhasagaropama, which is commonly used in this text and other texts as Sagaropama or Sagar. Ten Kodakodi Adhasagaropama is one Utsarpini and the same amount of time is one Avasarpini. Together, these two make twenty Kodakodi Sagaropama, which is one Kalpakal.

## Area Measure
The smallest indivisible part of Pudgala is called Paramanu. This Paramanu is so subtle, being one Pradesh, that it cannot be perceived by the senses, let alone by the most powerful microscope. It is without beginning, middle, and end. The amount of space that one indivisible Paramanu occupies is called one Kshetrapradesh. A group of two or more Paramanu is called a Skandha. A Skandha with an infinite number of Paramanu is called Avasannasanna. Eight Avasannasanna make one Sannasanna Skandha, eight Sannasanna make one Tritarenu, eight Tritarenu make one Trasarenu, eight Trasarenu make one Ratharenu, eight Ratharenu make the hair tip of a high-enjoyment earth-dwelling being, eight such hair tips make the hair tip of a medium-enjoyment earth-dwelling being, eight such hair tips make the hair tip of a low-enjoyment earth-dwelling being, eight such hair tips make the hair tip of a karma-dwelling being, eight karma-dwelling hair tips make one Liksha (a scratch that arises in hair), eight Liksha make one Jua, eight Jua make one Yavamdhya (the middle part of a barley grain), and eight Yavamdhya make one Angul. This Angul is of three types: Utshedhangul, Pramanangul, and Atmangul. The Angul that is equal to eight Yavamdhya is called Utshedhangul. Five hundred Utshedhangul make one Pramanangul. That is, the Angul of the first Chakravarti of the Avasarpini time, who has a body five hundred Dhanush high, or the Angul of the humans here or the Videha, who have a similar height, is called Pramanangul. The measure of the Angul of humans, animals, gods, and hell beings, as well as the measure of the residence of gods and their cities, is done with Utshedhangul. The measure of islands, oceans, mountains, altars, rivers, ponds, and fields is done with Pramanangul. Various

**Six-Part Cosmography**

In the context of time, the measurement of objects used for work, such as pots, mirrors, ploughs, pestles, chariots, carts, umbrellas, fly whisks, thrones, bows, arrows, etc., as well as the measurement of houses, gardens, cities, and pleasure grounds for the temporary residence of humans, is done using the **ātma-angula** (soul-inch). Six **angula** make one **pāda** (foot), two **pāda** make one **vihrasti** (span), two **vihrasti** make one **hasta** (hand), two **hasta** make one **kiṣku**, two **kiṣku** make one **daṇḍa**, **yuga**, **dhanuṣ** (bow), **nālī** (channel), or **mūṣala** (pestle). Two thousand **dhanuṣ** make one **kośa**, and four **kośa** make one **yojana**.

The measurement of **ardha-palya** has been explained above. By multiplying the **ardha-palya** by the number of its **ardha-ccheda** (half-divisions), the measurement of **sūcyangula** (needle-inch) is obtained. The square of **sūcyangula** is called **pratara-angula** (square-inch), and its cube is called **ghana-angula** (cubic-inch).

The **ardha-palya** is divided into an infinite number of parts. Alternatively, the measurement obtained by multiplying the **ghana-angula** by the infinite number of **ardha-ccheda** of the **ardha-palya** is called **jagacchreṇī** (world-series). The seventh part of the **jagacchreṇī** is called **rāju** or **rajju** (rope). The measurement of this **rāju** is equal to the extent of the **madhyaloka** (middle world). The square of the **jagacchreṇī** is called **jagat-pratar** (world-square), and its cube is called **ghana-loka** (cubic-world).

These eight measurements, namely **palya-upamā** (comparison with **palya**), **sāgara-upamā** (comparison with ocean), **sūcyangula**, **pratara-angula**, **ghana-angula**, **jagacchreṇī**, **jagat-pratar**, and **ghana-loka**, are different types of **upamā-pramāṇa** (comparative measurement). They are used in this text to explain the measurements of **dravya** (substance), **kṣetra** (space), and **kāla** (time) as required.

**4. Bhāva-pramāṇa** (Conceptual Measurement): The knowledge of the actual number of a thing through the above three types of measurements is called **bhāva-pramāṇa**. This means that wherever a measurement is given for **dravya**, **kāla**, or **kṣetra** in relation to a particular **guṇasthāna** (quality-place) and **mārgaṇasthāna** (path-place), that measurement should be understood as **bhāva-pramāṇa**, i.e., the actual knowledge of that measurement.

In the enumeration of numbers, the number of living beings is first described in relation to **guṇasthāna** and then in relation to **mārgaṇasthāna**. The author of the sūtra (aphorism) first raises a question through the **pṛcchā-sūtra** (question-aphorism) and then gives the answer through the **uttara-sūtra** (answer-aphorism). For example, "How many **mithyā-dṛṣṭi** (false-sighted) living beings are there according to the measurement of **dravya**?" The answer is "Infinite." Now, there is a doubt here because there are many different types of infinity in a gross way, and an infinite number of types in a subtle way. So, how many entities should be considered as infinite here? The Ācārya (teacher) resolves this doubt by taking recourse to **kāla-pramāṇa** (time-measurement). He says that the number of infinite **utsarpini** (ascending) and **avasarpiṇī** (descending) time cycles that have passed in the past is the measurement of time. Even more than that,

1. The divisions obtained by repeatedly dividing any desired quantity by half until one is reached are called **ardha-ccheda**.
2. See **Rājāvartikā**, **a.** 3, **sū.** 38, commentary.

## Introduction
[29]
Mithyadrishti jivas are not exhausted, meaning they are more in number. Here, the meaning of exhausted should be understood as follows: On one side, place the multitude of Mithyadrishti jivas, and on the other side, place the heap of times of all the infinite Utsarpini and Avasarpini kalpas that have passed in the past. Now, remove one Mithyadrishti jiva from the multitude of Mithyadrishti jivas and one time from the times of the past. In this way, continuously reducing them, all the times of the past will be exhausted, but the multitude of Mithyadrishti jivas will not be exhausted. Even if the inquisitive mind of the seeker still desires to know the proof more clearly, then for its clarification, the Acharya, taking refuge in Kshetraprarupa, answered that there are as many Mithyadrishti jivas as there are Akashapradeshas in infinite infinite lokas. Thus, knowing the actual number of Mithyadrishti jivas through the proofs of Dravya, Kala, and Kshetra is called Bhava-pramana.

Secondly, the proof of the jivas in the second, third, fourth, and fifth Gunasthanas is said to be countless times the size of a Palya, but there is a deficiency in their proof. Accordingly, the number of jivas in the fifth Gunasthan is more than the number of jivas in the second Gunasthan, and the number of jivas in the third Gunasthan is more than that, and the number of jivas in the fourth Gunasthan is even more than that. The proof of the jivas in the sixth Gunasthan is said to be Koti-prithaktva by the Sutrakar, but the Dhavalakar, following the teachings of the Guruparampara, has stated it to be 59,398,206 (five crore, ninety-three lakh, ninety-eight thousand, two hundred and six). The proof of the seventh Gunasthan is said to be Sankhyat by the Sutrakar, but the Dhavalakar has explained its meaning as a quantity below Koti-prithaktva and, according to the Guru-upadesha, has stated it to be 29,699,103 (two crore, ninety-six lakh, ninety-nine thousand, one hundred and three). This means that since the time of the seventh Gunasthan is half that of the sixth Gunasthan, the number of its jivas is also half that of the sixth. Above this, in the Upshama-shreni and Kshapaka-shreni, the number of jivas is stated by the Sutrakar to be one, two, three, etc., up to 54 and 108 respectively, and in each Gunasthan, it is stated to be Sankhyat in relation to the time of both the shrenis. However, the Dhavalakar, mentioning the opinions of many Acharyas, has given priority to the opinion of the last verse and stated the number of jivas accumulated in each Gunasthan of the Upshama-shreni to be 299 and the number of jivas accumulated in each Gunasthan of the Kshapaka-shreni to be 588. Accordingly, in the eighth, ninth, and tenth Gunasthanas related to the Upshama and Kshapaka shrenis, the number of jivas in each should be known to be 897-897. The number of jivas in the eleventh Gunasthan is stated to be 299 and the number of jivas in the twelfth Gunasthan is stated to be 598. In the thirteenth Gunasthan, it is stated to be one, two, three, etc., up to one hundred and eight, and the proof of the Sarva-sayogika Kevali Jinas accumulated in the thirteenth Gunasthan is stated by the Sutrakar to be Shata-sahasra-prithaktva, which means...

According to various beliefs described in the Dhavalakarya, different numbers are mentioned. Finally, according to the teachings received from the lineage of Acharyas, it is stated that there are eight lakh eighty-eight thousand five hundred and two (898,502) Jivas. The number of Jivas in the fourteenth Gunasthana is stated to be one, two, three, and so on up to one hundred and eight (108) with respect to the order of attainment, and five hundred and ninety-eight (598) with respect to the duration of the Sanchaya Kala.

In summary, the entire range of Gunasthanas should be understood in the form of a small and large number as follows - Jivas in the eleventh Gunasthana are the smallest (countable) in number. The Jivas in the twelfth and fourteenth Gunasthanas are twice the number of those. The Jivas in the eighth, ninth, and tenth Gunasthanas are particularly more numerous than both these groups. The Jivas in the thirteenth Gunasthana are countably more than them. The Jivas in the seventh Gunasthana are countably more than them. The Jivas in the sixth Gunasthana are twice the number. The Jivas in the fifth Gunasthana are innumerably more than the sixth Gunasthana Jivas. The Jivas in the second Gunasthana are innumerably more than them. The Jivas in the third Gunasthana are countably more, and the Jivas in the fourth Gunasthana are innumerably more than them. The Siddha Jivas are infinitely more than them, and the Mithyadristi Jivas are infinitely more than the Siddhas. The entire mass of Jivas is somewhat more than the Mithyadristi Jivas.

After describing the number of Jivas according to the Gunasthanas, the author has described the number of Jivas according to the fourteen Marganaasthanas. The number of Marganaasthanas is also stated in terms of Dravya, Kala, and Kshetra, so the actual meaning of the numbers mentioned in the Sutras should be understood accordingly. Where the words Padara or Pratar appear in the Sutras, they should be understood to mean Jagat-pratar, Angula should be understood as Suchyangula, Sedi or Sreni as Jagacchhreni, and Loka as Ghanaloka. Additionally, there are some other special terms used in the Sutras, the meanings of which should be understood as follows:

Ayama - Length of a region
Vishkambha - Width of a region
Vishkambhasuchi - Width at the center of a circular region
Varga - Multiplying a number by itself
Vargamula - The root of a square
Ghana - Multiplying a number by itself twice

## Introduction

**[31 Cube Root -** The root of a quantity whose multiplication results in a cubic quantity. For example, the cube root of 64 is 4. **Saatireka -** Slightly more than the desired quantity, also called Saadhik. **Visheshaadhik -** All quantities below twice the desired quantity. **Sankhyatgunit -** Twice the quantity and above, thrice, four times, etc., all quantities that fall under the category of Sankhyat. **Asankhyatgunit -** Multiplying the quantity by the middle Asankhyat as much as possible. **Anantgunit -** Multiplying the quantity by the middle Anant as much as possible. **Dvitiya Varga Mool -** The second square root of the desired quantity. For example, the first square root of 16 is 4 and the second square root is 2. Similarly, one should understand the third, fourth, etc., square roots. **Bhagahara -** The quantity by which the desired quantity is divided. **Avaharakal -** The time-related quantity in the form of Bhagahara.

According to the number of beings mentioned within the Marganas in accordance with the measure of matter, one should understand the relative scarcity of beings with Anant, Asankhyat, and Sankhyat quantities in this way:

In the realm of the **Anavantara** and **Anantashiva** souls, the **Abhavya** souls are the least numerous, and the souls in the subsequent realms are progressively more numerous. Among the **Asankhyata** souls, the **Desasanayata** souls are the least numerous, and the souls in the subsequent realms are progressively more numerous. Among the **Sankhyata** souls, the **Sukshma Samparaya Sanayami** souls are the least numerous, and the souls in the subsequent realms are progressively more numerous. Thus, by understanding the principle of **dravya pramana** (quantity of substance), one can gain a clear understanding of the number of souls.

**3**

The question naturally arises: where do these countless souls reside, whose existence is known through **sat prarupana** (true form) and whose number is known through **sankhya prarupana** (numerical form)? To answer this question, the Acharya has described the **kṣetra** (realm) in detail. The **kṣetra** refers to the current dwelling place of souls. Where is this **kṣetra** located? The answer is that wherever we reside, the infinite **ākāśa** (space) extends in all ten directions. Right in the middle of this **ākāśa** is the **lokākāśa**, where countless souls and other substances like **pudgala** reside. The presence or absence of substances creates two divisions of **ākāśa**. The **ākāśa** where souls and other substances are found is called **lokākāśa**, and the infinite **ākāśa** beyond it in all ten directions is called **alokākāśa**. In this **alokākāśa**, only **ākāśa** exists, and no other substance is found.

The shape of **lokākāśa** resembles a man standing facing north, with his legs spread out and his hands resting on his waist. This **lokākāśa** is naturally divided into three parts: the part below the waist is called **adholōka**, the part above the waist is called **ūrdhvalōka**, and the middle part at the waist is called **madhyalōka**. The **adholōka** below the **madhyalōka** is seven **rāju** high. Its width at the bottom is seven **rāju**. The width gradually decreases upwards, reaching one **rāju** in the **madhyalōka**. The **ūrdhvalōka** above the **madhyalōka** is seven **rāju** high. However, its width at the bottom, in the **madhyalōka**, is one **rāju**. It then gradually increases, reaching five **rāju** near the elbows, where the **Brahmalōka** is located. It then decreases again, reaching one **rāju** at the top, where the **Siddhālōka** is located. This undulating expanse is the extent of the **kṣetra** in the east-west direction. The extent of the **lokākāśa** in the north-south direction is...

Preface
From bottom to top, there are seven Rajus everywhere.
In the exact middle part of this fourteen Rajus high Loka, there is a Raju long, a Raju wide, and fourteen Rajus high Loka Nadi, which is also called Trasanadi because it is the abode of Trasa Jivas. In the lower Loka, within this Trasanadi, there are seven Naraks where Nāraki Jivas reside. In the middle Loka, within this Trasanadi, there are innumerable islands and oceans that are situated encircling each other. Among them is the Jambū Dvīpa, which is one lakh Yojana in expanse. In its exact middle is the Sumeru Mountain, which is one lakh Yojana high. All the Lokas below the base of this Sumeru are called the Lower Loka, and the Lokas above the peak of Sumeru are called the Upper Loka. In this Upper Loka, there are sixteen Svarga, nine Anudisa, and five Anuttara, where the Devas reside. In fact, Sumeru itself divides the three Lokas. The area with one Raju expanse and one lakh Yojana height is called the Middle Loka, as it is here that the Manuṣya and Tiryañca Jivas reside, hence it is also called the Nara-Tiryag Loka. Surrounding the Jambū Dvīpa is the Lavaṇa Samudra, which is two lakh Yojana wide. Surrounding it is the Dhātakīkhaṇḍa Dvīpa, which is four lakh Yojana wide. Surrounding it is the Kālodadhi Samudra, which is eight lakh Yojana wide. Surrounding it is the Puṣkara Varṣa Dvīpa, which is sixteen lakh Yojana wide. In the exact middle of this Dvīpa is the Mānuṣottara Mountain. Beyond this mountain, neither any human resides nor can one go, hence it is called Mānuṣottara. Thus, the area of one Jambū Dvīpa, one Dhātakīkhaṇḍa Dvīpa, and half Puṣkara Varṣa Dvīpa is called the Manuṣya Loka. Its width in the middle part is forty-five lakh Yojana as per the diameter of the Sūcī. Beyond this, all the innumerable islands and oceans end with the Svayambhūramaṇa Samudra. The Middle Loka ends here. These innumerable islands and oceans are called the Tiryag Loka as only Tiryañca Jivas are found there. The volume of the Manuṣya Loka is forty-five lakh Yojana. The volume of the Tiryag Loka is one Raju, which is also the volume of the Middle Loka. The volume of the Lower Loka is 196 Ghanarājus, and the volume of the Upper Loka is 147 Ghanarājus. The total volume of the Lokaākāśa is 343 Ghanarājus.

##  Chapter 34: The Sixfold Classification

It is essential to understand that any living being, small or large, resides within an infinitesimal part of the infinite Lokakasha (universe). However, when considering the first Gunasthan (stage of spiritual development), the question arises: "In how many regions do Mithyadrishti (wrongly-seeing) beings reside?" The answer is: "They reside in all regions." This is because the Lokakasha, which is 343 Rajus (units of measurement) in size, is densely populated by stationary beings. However, with the exception of a few, Trasa (hell) beings reside only within the Trasa Nadi (hell region). Beings from the second Gunasthan to the fourteenth Gunasthan reside in infinitesimal parts of the Lokakasha. Only the Kevali (omniscient) beings, who have attained the state of Samyogi Kevali (omniscient with a body), reside in infinitesimal parts of the Lokakasha during the Dand and Kapata Samudghat (states of spiritual awakening), in countless parts of the Lokakasha during the Pratar Samudghat, and in all regions during the Lokapurana Samudghat.

This chapter elaborates on the regions inhabited by beings of different Margna (spiritual paths) and their respective stages of spiritual development. In summary, beings belonging to the Margna with an infinite number of Ekendriya (single-sense) beings reside in all regions, while those belonging to other Margna reside in infinitesimal parts of the Lokakasha. The Samyogi Jins (liberated beings) who belong to the Margna of Kevalgyan (omniscience), Kevaldarshan (omniscient vision), Yathakyat Samyam (perfect control), etc., reside in infinitesimal parts of the Lokakasha during ordinary states, in countless parts of the Lokakasha during the Pratar Samudghat, and in all regions during the Lokapurana Samudghat. The Badar Vayu Kayik (wind-bodied) beings reside in infinitesimal parts of the Lokakasha.

## Chapter 4: The Touch Classification

The Kshetra Prarupana (region classification) describes the current region of beings. However, the Sparshan Prarupana (touch classification) considers the region of beings in the past, present, and future. The place where a being is born or resides is called its Svasthan (own place), and the area covered by its movement is called Viharvat Svasthan (place of movement). The Viharvat Svasthan is larger than the Svasthan for every being. For example, the region of a Deva (heavenly being) in the sixteenth heaven is an infinitesimal part of the Lokakasha compared to its Svasthan. However, it can travel down to the third hell, covering a region of eight Rajus. This is because the third hell is two Rajus below the Madhyaloka (middle world), and the sixteenth heaven is six Rajus above it. Thus, the Devas of the sixteenth heaven have touched a region of eight Rajus in the past. Similarly, the region of beings increases during Samudghat (spiritual awakening) and Uppaad (birth) compared to their Vihar (movement). The expansion of a being's region beyond its original body due to specific causes like Vedana (pain), Kashay (passions), etc., is called Samudghat.

## Introduction
[35]
There are seven types of **Samudghat** - **Vedana Samudghat**, **Kshaya Samudghat**, **Vaikriyik Samudghat**, **Aharak Samudghat**, **Taijas Samudghat**, **Maranantik Samudghat**, and **Kevali Samudghat**.

**Vedana Samudghat** is the outward expansion of the **Jiva's** regions due to pain caused by diseases and other ailments in the body. 

**Kshaya Samudghat** is the outward expansion of the **Jiva's** regions due to **Kshayas** like anger, etc.

**Vaikriyik Samudghat** is the outward expansion of the **Atma-pradeshas** from the original body during the time of **Vikriya** (transformation) when **Devas** and others create a new body in addition to their original body.

**Aharak Samudghat** is the outward expansion of the **Atma-pradeshas** in the form of an **Aharak** (nourishing) **Putala** to resolve doubts for a **Samyata** (controlled) **Sadhu** who is in a state of **Pramatta** (distraction).

**Taijas Samudghat** is the outward expansion of the **Atma-pradeshas** in the form of a **Taijas** (radiant) **Putala** when a **Sadhu** experiences feelings of **Nigraha** (restraint) or **Anugraha** (grace), resulting in auspicious or inauspicious **Taijas** (radiant) **Putalas**.

**Maranantik Samudghat** is the outward expansion of the **Jiva's** **Atma-pradeshas** at the moment of death, extending to the place where the **Jiva** will take birth in the next life, touching that place and returning back.

**Kevali Samudghat** is the outward expansion of the **Atma-pradeshas** of a **Kevali** (omniscient) **Bhagwan** in the form of **Danda** (punishment), **Kapata** (barrier), **Pratar** (reflection), and **Lok-puran** (filling of the universe) to exhaust the remaining **Aghatiya** (non-violent) **Karmas** throughout the three realms.

In these seven **Samudghats**, the **Jiva's** **Kshetra** (field of activity) expands beyond the **Kshetra** of the body's **Avagahana** (perception).

Additionally, the outward expansion of the **Jiva's** regions from the body is also observed during the **Up-pad** (birth) period. **Up-pad** is the **Jiva's** birth in a new **Paryaya** (existence) after leaving its previous **Paryaya**.

Therefore, there are ten stages: **Swasthan-Swasthan**, **Viharvat-Swasthan**, **Vedana**, **Kshaya**, **Vaikriyik**, **Aharak**, **Taijas**, **Maranantik**, **Kevali Samudghat**, and **Up-pad**.

This **Sparshan-Prarupanam** (description of touch) elaborates on how much **Kshetra** (field of activity) a **Jiva** of a particular **Gunasthan** (stage of spiritual development) and **Marganava** (path of liberation) has touched in the past, based on these ten stages. However, a glimpse of it is provided here.

**Mithyadristi** (false-believing) **Jivas** reside in all **Lokas** (realms), so their **Swasthan-gat** (original) **Kshetra** is all **Lokas**. They have also touched all **Lokas** in the past and will continue to do so in the future, based on the stages possible in their **Gunasthan**.

It is important to note that **Aharak Samudghat** and **Taijas Samudghat** only occur for **Sadhus** who are in the sixth **Gunasthan**. They do not occur for others. **Kevali Samudghat** is only possible in the thirteenth **Gunasthan**, not elsewhere. **Vaikriyik Samudghat** occurs for **Devas**, **Narakis**, or **Riddhi-prapta** (wealth-attaining) **Sadhus** in the first four **Gunasthanas**. **Bhog-bhumij** (worldly) **Manushyas** (humans) and **Tiryachas** (animals) also experience **Samudghat** in the form of **A-prithak Vikriya** (separate transformation). **Vedana**, **Kshaya**, and **Maranantik Samudghat** occur for all **Gati** (mobile) **Jivas** in the first, second, fourth, and other **Gunasthanas** where they are possible.

Chakkhandagama
The sāsādana-samyagdṛṣṭi jīvas (right-belief beings in the second gunasthāna) currently reside in only an infinitesimal part of the loka (universe). However, in the past, they have touched an area slightly less than eight and a half (8 1/2) rajus and slightly less than thirteen and a half (13 1/2) rajus. This means that with respect to the four categories of vihāravat-svastāna (residence), vedanā (feelings), kaṣāya (passions), and vaikriyika-samudghāta (manifestation of psychic powers), the sāsādana-samyagdṛṣṭi jīvas have touched eight parts out of the fourteen parts of the trasanāḍī (mobile organism), i.e., there is not a single region within the eight-raju-sized trasanāḍī that has not been touched by the sāsādana-samyagdṛṣṭis of the four gatis (destinies). This eight-raju-sized area within the trasanāḍī should be taken from the third nāraka (hell) up to the sixteenth svarga (celestial realm). The reason for this is that the bhavanavāsī devas (celestial beings) themselves go up to the third nāraka and down to the top of the first svarga. However, through the efforts of the higher svargas, they can also travel up to the sixteenth svarga. Due to their extensive travel in this area, there is not a single space within this region that has not been touched by the bodies of these devas of the second gunasthāna. This touched area is called the eight-part (of the fourteen-part) loka-nāḍī (universal organism) touched area. The reason for saying "slightly less" is that the bhavanavāsī devas go only up to the floor of the third pṛthivī (earth), where the nārakīs (hell beings) reside, but the floor of the third pṛthivī is two rajus lower than the middle loka. The floor of this pṛthivī is one thousand yojanas thick and solid, where no nārakīs are found, but only the beings above it reside. Therefore, the traveling devas do not go up to the floor of the third pṛthivī, but only up to its upper part. This one-thousand-yojana reduction is the reason for using the term "slightly less" here. Wherever the term "slightly less" is used, the meaning should be understood in a similar manner. With respect to māraNāntika-samudghāta (manifestation of psychic powers at the time of death), the sāsādana-gunasthānavī jīvas have touched twelve parts out of the fourteen parts of the loka-nāḍī in the past. This means that the sāsādana-gunasthānavī nāraki beings, who are born in the middle loka, manifest māraNāntika-samudghāta up to there, and the same gunasthānavī bhavanavāsī and other devas manifest māraNāntika-samudghāta in the pṛthivīkāyika (earth-bodied) beings at the end of the upper loka. Thus, the five rajus from the base of Sumeru up to the sixth pṛthivī, and the seven rajus up to the end of the loka, together make up the slightly less than twelve rajus area that the beings of the second gunasthāna have touched in the past and will continue to touch in the future. The term "slightly less" should be understood in the manner explained earlier.

## Introduction
[37] In this manner, in this Sparshan Prarupana, the representation of the area touched in the past has been done with respect to the ten categories of Svasthana, etc., of beings having fourteen Gunasthanas and fourteen Marganasthanas.

## Kal Prarupana
[5] The discussion of how long beings stay in each Gunasthana and Marganasthana, both minimally and maximally, is done in the Anuyogadwar called Kalnugam. The Sutrakar has done this discussion of time with respect to one being and many beings. For example, how long do Mithyadrishti beings stay in the Mithyatva Gunasthana? The answer to this question is that with respect to many beings, Mithyadrishti beings always stay in the Mithyatva Gunasthana, meaning there is not a single moment in all three times when Mithyadrishti beings are not found. But with respect to one being, the time of Mithyatva is of three types: Anadi-Anant, Anadi-Sant, and Sadi-Sant. The time of Mithyatva of Abhavya beings should be known as Anadi-Anant. Because their Mithyatva has neither a beginning nor an end. The time of Mithyatva of those Abhavya beings who are Anadi Mithyadrishti is Anadi-Sant, meaning their Mithyatva is Anadi because they have not attained Samyaktva from the beginning of time until today, but their Mithyatva is Sant because they will attain Samyaktva in the future and their Mithyatva will end. The time of Mithyatva of those beings who have attained Samyaktva once, but due to the influence of the Sankleshas of the Pariṇāmas, again attain Mithyatva, should be known as Sadi-Sant. The Sutrakar, by pointing out these three types of Mithyatva-kalas, has indicated the least Sadi-Sant time of Mithyatva with respect to one being as Antarmuhurt, which means that if an Asanyata Samyagdristi, or a Sanyata-Asanyata, or a Pramatta-Sanyata being attains Mithyatva due to the fall of Pariṇāmas, and stays in the Mithyatva state for the shortest time of Antarmuhurt, and then again becomes Asanyata Samyagdristi, or Sanyata-Asanyata, or Apramatta-Sanyata, then the least time of Mithyatva of such a being is found to be Antarmuhurt. This type of Mithyatva is called Sadi-Sant because it has both a beginning and an end. The highest time of this Sadi-Sant Mithyatva is slightly less than 'Ardha-Pudgal-Parivartan-Praman'. This means that when a being attains Samyaktva for the first time and very quickly attains Mithyatva, then even if it stays in the Mithyatva Gunasthana for the maximum time, it will stay for a time slightly less than the time it takes for Ardha-Pudgal-Parivartan, and after that, it will attain Samyaktva according to the rule, and by holding onto Samyama, it will move towards Moksha.

1. To understand the nature of Ardha-Pudgal-Parivartan, one should refer to the Dhavala Tika of this Prakarana, the Bhavya-Marganas of the Go. Jivakanda, and the Sarvarthasiddhi, Chapter 2, Sutra 8, and its Tika.

[38]
The **Chakkhandagam** describes the inferior and superior time periods of the fourteen **Gunasthanas** and fourteen **Marganas**, as well as the nature of various beings, in a different way. By studying this time period description, readers will be able to learn many new things.
[6] **Antara Prarupana** - **Antara** means separation, disconnection, or absence. When a being in a particular **Gunastana** leaves that **Gunastana** and goes to another **Gunastana**, the time period before it returns to the same **Gunastana** is called **Antara Kala** or **Virah Kala**. The shortest **Virah Kala** is called **Jghanya Antara** and the longest **Virah Kala** is called **Utkrisht Antara**. This **Antara Prarupana** describes the time period for which a being remains in **Antara** from a particular **Gunastana** and **Margana** - the minimum and maximum time periods.
For example, someone asked about the **Antara Kala** of **Mithyadristi** beings in relation to **Ogh**. The answer is that there is no **Antara** in relation to various beings, they are continuous. This means that **Mithyadristi** beings are always found in the world, so their **Antara Kala** is not possible. However, the **Jghanya Antara Kala** of **Mithyatva** in relation to one being is **Antarmuhurt** long. This **Jghanya Antara Kala** occurs when a **Mithyadristi** being attains **Samyaktva** due to the purification of **Parinamas** and becomes **Asanyata Samyagdristi**. This being remains in the fourth **Gunastana** for the shortest time period of **Antarmuhurt** with **Samyaktva**, and then falls due to **Sanklesh** etc. and becomes **Mithyadristi**. The **Antarmuhurt** time period that is free from **Mithyatva Paryaya** before leaving the **Mithyatva Gunastana** and attaining another **Gunastana** and then returning to the same **Gunastana** is the **Jghanya Antara Kala** of the **Mithyadristi Gunastana** in relation to that one being.
The **Utkrisht Antara Kala** of **Mithyatva** in relation to one being is slightly less than two **Chyasat Sagar**, or one hundred and thirty-two (132) **Sagaropam**. This **Utkrisht Antara Kala** occurs when a being is born in the **Lantav-Kapishta** heaven of the fourteenth **Sagar** lifespan. After one **Sagar**, it attains **Samyaktva**. It remains there for thirteen **Sagars** with **Samyaktva** and then falls and becomes a human. Here, it dies while practicing or not practicing **Samyama**, and is born as a god in the sixteenth heaven with a lifespan of twenty-two **Sagars**. It remains there with **Samyaktva** for its entire lifespan and then falls and becomes a human again. In this **Bhava**, it dies while practicing **Samyama** and is born in the ninth **Graiveyak** with a lifespan of thirty-one **Sagars**. It remains **Samyagdristi** for its entire life, but at the end of its life, after sixty-six **Sagars** are completed, the emergence of **Mishra Prakriti** causes it to attain the third **Gunastana**.

Preface
[39]
He became a samyagdrishti again and rested there for some time, and then he became a human again in this life. Again, in this life too, he adopted the vow and died, and was born among the devas with a lifespan of twenty, twenty-two or twenty-four sagaras. In this way, he continued to wander in the lives of humans and devas with samyaktva, until the second time the sixty-six sagaras were not completed. After the period of sixty-six sagaras of living with samyaktva was over, due to the increase of klesas in the results, he fell and became a mithyadrishti. In this way, he remained a samyaktvi for a continuous period of one hundred and thirty-two sagaras, remaining in the mithyadrishtiguna-sthana. This is the excellent antarakala of his mithyadrishti. It should be specially known here that the said jiva, in whichever human births he was born, he became the bearer of a devayu less than the human lifespan. If the human lifespan is not reduced in the devayu, then the antarakala will be more than one hundred and thirty-two sagaras.

It is also specially known here that the period of one hundred and thirty-two sagaras of wandering in humans and devas that has been described, is said to make the dull-witted understand. In reality, he can complete one hundred and thirty-two sagaras in any heaven or Graiveyaka and the like.

After the description of kala, the intention of describing the antaras is that the time of each guna-sthana or marga-na-sthana is connected with its antara. In the description of kala, the names of the guna-sthanas that have been described as the same for all jivas, their antara is not different for those jivas. Except for them, the antara of all other guna-sthana jivas is different for different jivas and for one jiva. In this way, there are six guna-sthanas that are antara-rahita (without antara) for different jivas - 1. Mithyadrishti, 2. Asanyata-samyagdrishti, 3. Sanyatasanyata, 4. Pramatta-sanyata, 5. Apramatta-sanyata and 6. Sayogikevali. Many jivas always remain present in these guna-sthanas. However, except for the Sayogikevali guna-sthana, in the remaining five guna-sthanas, there is a minimum and maximum antara for one jiva, which the readers can know very well by studying the text.

There are only eight marga-nas that have an antara. All the rest remain continuous. The marga-nas in which antara is possible are called santara-marga-nas. The first of those eight is Upasham Samyaktva Marga-na. Its maximum antara is seven ahoratras (days and nights). This means that in the world, the absence of Upasham Samyagdrishti jivas can be at most up to seven ahoratras. After them, some jiva or the other will definitely adopt Upasham Samyaktva. The second santara-marga-na is Sukshma-sampraaya Sanyama Marga-na. Its maximum antara is six...

**Chhakhandagam**
There are eight **Santarmargṇā**s. The third is **Sāntaramārgaṇā Āhārakāyakayogamārgaṇā**. Its **utkṛṣṭa antarākāla** is **varṣapṛthaktva**. The fourth is **Āhārakamiśrakāyakayogamārgaṇā**. Its **utkṛṣṭa antarākāla** is also **varṣapṛthaktva**. The fifth is **Vaikriyikamiśrakāyakayogamārgaṇā**. Its **utkṛṣṭa antarākāla** is **bārah muhūrta**. The sixth is **Labdhyaparyāpta Manuşyagatimārgaṇā**, the seventh is **Sāsādan Samyaktvamārgaṇā**, and the eighth is **Samyagmithyātvamārgaṇā**. The **utkṛṣṭa antarākāla** of all three is **pṛthak-pṛthak patyakā asankhyātavāṁ bhāga**. The **jighnya antarākāla** of all these **Sāntaramārgaṇā**s is **ek samaypramāṇa**. When the **antarākāla** of all these **Sāntaramārgaṇā**s is complete, the beings belonging to that **mārgaṇā** are born according to the rules. Except for these eight **mārgaṇā**s, beings belonging to all other **mārgaṇā**s are always found.

How much **jighnya** and **utkṛṣṭa antarākāla** is possible for a being in relation to a particular **guṇasthāna** and **mārgaṇāsthāna**, and how much **antarākāla** is possible for different beings in relation to each other, can only be understood by studying this **prarupaṇā**.

**7 Bhāvprarupaṇā**
This **bhāvprarupaṇā** describes the **bhāva**s that occur in different **guṇasthāna**s and **mārgaṇāsthāna**s. The specific results that arise in a being due to the **udaya**, **upasama**, etc., of **karma**s are called **bhāva**s. These **bhāva**s are of five types: 1) **Audayikabhāva**, 2) **Aupaśamikabhāva**, 3) **Kṣāyikabhāva**, 4) **Kṣāyopaśamikabhāva**, and 5) **Pāriṇāmikabhāva**. The **bhāva**s that arise from the **udaya** of **karma**s are called **Audayikabhāva**. It has twenty-one divisions: **naraka**, **tiryanch**, **manuşya**, and **deva** - these four **gati**s; **strī**, **puruṣa**, and **napumsaka** - these three **linga**s; **krodha**, **māna**, **māyā**, and **lobha** - these four **kaṣāya**s; **mithyātvam**, **asiddhatvam**, **ajñāna**, **asanyama**, and **kṛṣṇa**, **nīla**, **kāpota**, **pīta**, **padma**, and **śukla** - these six **leśyā**s. The **bhāva**s that arise from the **upasama** of **mohakarma** are called **Aupaśamikabhāva**. It has two divisions: 1) **Aupaśamikasamyaktvam** and 2) **Aupaśamikacāritra**. The **bhāva**s that arise from the **kṣaya** of **ghātiyakarma**s are called **Kṣāyikabhāva**. It has nine divisions: 1) **Kṣāyikasamyaktvam**, 2) **Kṣāyikacāritra**, 3) **Kṣāyikajñāna**, 4) **Kṣāyikadarśana**, 5) **Kṣāyikadāna**, 6) **Kṣāyikalābha**, 7) **Kṣāyikabhoga**, 8) **Kṣāyikupabhoga**, and 9) **Kṣāyikavīrya**. The **bhāva**s that arise from the **kṣayopaśama** of **ghātiyakarma**s are called **Kṣāyopaśamikabhāva**. It has eighteen divisions: **mati**, **śruta**, **avadhi**, and **manahparyaya** - these four **jñāna**s; **kumati**, **kuśruta**, and **vibhāngavadhi** - these three **ajñāna**s; **cakṣu**, **achakṣu**, and **avadhi** - these three **darśana**s; **kṣāyopaśamikadāna**, **lābha**, **bhoga**, **upabhoga**, and **vīrya** - these five **labdhi**s; **kṣāyopaśamikasamyaktvam**, **kṣāyopaśamikacāritra**, and **sanyamāsanyama**. The **bhāva**s that are not dependent on the **udaya**, **upasama**, etc., of any **karma**, but are naturally present from the beginning of time, are called **Pāriṇāmikabhāva**. It has three divisions: 1) **Jīvatvam**, 2) **Bhavyaṭvam**, and 3) **Abhavyaṭvam**.

Preface
The discussion in this exposition of sentiments (Bhava Prarupana) has been done to determine in which Gunasthana (stage of spiritual development) and which Margana (path) a particular sentiment occurs. For example, when asked about the sentiment of 'Mithyadrishti' (false belief) in terms of Ogha (influx of karmic matter), the answer given is that Mithyadrishti is an Audayika (arising from the fruition of karma) sentiment. The reason for this is that the false belief of the living beings arises due to the rise of the Mithyatva (false belief) karma. Here, a doubt can be raised that when the Mithyadrishti living being has other sentiments like knowledge, faith, spirituality etc. apart from the sentiment of Mithyatva, then why is only the Audayika sentiment mentioned? The answer given is that although the Mithyadrishti living being has sentiments other than the Audayika sentiment, those are not due to the Mithyadrishti, but the sole cause of Mithyadrishti is the rise of Mithyatva karma, therefore the Mithyadrishti arising in the Mithyatva Gunasthana is called the Audayika sentiment.

The reason for describing the other sentiments as Parinamika (transformational) in the next Gunasthana, even though other sentiments are present, is that just as the sentiments of Jivatva (living-ness) etc. are Parinamika and the rise, subsidence etc. of karma are not the cause for them, similarly for the sentiment of Sāsādana Samyaktva (quasi-right faith), the rise of Darshanmohaniya (deluding) karma, its subsidence etc. are not the cause, therefore, only the Parinamika sentiment should be understood here.

In the third Gunasthana, the sentiment is Ksayopashamika (partially subsided and partially manifested). Here a doubt can be raised that even when the obstructive karma is in the state of rise, the part of the natural quality of the living being that is observed is called Ksayopashamika. But in the rise of Samyagmithyatva (mixed right and wrong belief) nature, even the particle of the quality of Samyaktva (right faith) does not remain. If this is not accepted, then the complete destructiveness of Samyagmithyatva nature cannot be established. Therefore, it is not correct to consider the sentiment of Samyagmithyatva as Ksayopashamika. The answer to this is that when the Samyagmithyatva nature rises, a mixed sentiment of faith and non-faith arises. In that, the part of faith is the part of the quality of Samyaktva, which is not destroyed by the rise of Samyagmithyatva nature. Therefore, the sentiment of Samyagmithyatva should be considered Ksayopashamika only.

In the fourth Gunasthana, the three sentiments of Aupashamika (subsided), Ksayika (destroyed) and Ksayopashamika are found. The reason for this is that here the subsidence, destruction and partial subsidence and partial manifestation of Darshanmohaniya karma all three occur.

The first four Gunasthanas arise due to the rise, subsidence, destruction etc. of Darshanmohaniya karma, therefore, the exposition of the sentiments in those Gunasthanas has been done with reference to Darshanmohaniya. The Asanyama (non-restraint) sentiment found up to the fourth Gunasthana arises due to the rise of Charitramohaniya (deluding) karma, and is an Audayika sentiment, but its discussion has not been done here.

Page #55:
---------------------------
The translation preserving the Jain terms is as follows:

The chapter on the eight gunasthanas (stages of spiritual development) from the fifth to the twelfth discusses the states of the charitra-mohaniya (delusion-obscuring) karma in terms of its ksayopasama (subsidence-cum-destruction), upasama (subsidence), and ksaya (destruction). In the fifth, sixth, and seventh gunasthanas, the state is ksayopsamika (subsidence-cum-destruction) due to the ksayopasama of charitra-moha. In the eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh gunasthanas, the state is auspahmika (of subsidence) due to the upasama (subsidence) of charitra-moha. And in the four gunasthanas related to the ksapaka-sreni (series of destruction), the state is ksayika (of destruction) due to the ksaya (destruction) of charitra-mohaniya. The ksayika states found in the thirteenth and fourteenth gunasthanas should be understood to have arisen from the ksaya of the ghatikakarmas (destructive karmas).

Just as the exposition of these states has been done in the gunasthanas, a detailed exposition of the states in relation to the margana-sthanas (stations of spiritual development) has also been provided, which the readers can easily experience by self-study of the text.

The section on alpa-bahutva-prarUpana (exposition of the fewer and greater numbers) presents the numerical paucity and abundance of the living beings found in the gunasthanas and margana-sthanas based on the numerical exposition. It is stated that in the three gunasthanas of apurvakarana and the like, the upashamika (subsided) living beings are mutually equal in terms of entry, and they are fewer in number compared to the other gunasthanas, because in these three gunasthanas, the living beings entering separately range from one to a maximum of fifty-four only. Such a small number of living beings is not found in any other gunasthana except these three upashamika ones. The upashanta-kasaya-vitaraga-chadmastha (equanimous, passionless, and concealed) living beings are also of the same numerical proportion, because the aforementioned upashamika living beings are the ones who progress to the eleventh gunasthana. The ksapaka (destructive) living beings in the three gunasthanas of apurvakarana and the like are numerically multiplied by a factor equal to the maximum number of living beings entering a single upashamika gunasthana, which is fifty-four. The kshina-kasaya-vitaraga-chadmastha (passionless and concealed) living beings are also of the same numerical proportion, because the aforementioned ksapaka living beings are the ones who enter this twelfth gunasthana. The sayogi-kevali and the ayogi-kevali jinas have an equal numerical entry, which is one hundred and eight. However, the sayogi-kevali jinas are numerically multiplied by a factor equal to the number of living beings entering during their accumulation period. The apramatta-samyata (vigilant and restrained) living beings in the seventh gunasthana are numerically multiplied by a factor equal to the sayogi-kevali jinas. The pramatta-samyata (negligent and restrained) living beings are numerically multiplied by a factor equal to the apramatta-samyata. The samyata-asamyata (restrained and unrestrained) living beings are numerically multiplied by an innumerable factor, because this category includes both human samyata-asamyatas and the tiryañca (animal) samyata-asamyatas. The sasadana-samyag-drsti (right-believer with one more birth) living beings are numerically multiplied by an innumerable factor compared to the samyata-asamyata. And the samyag-mithya-drsti (right-wrong-believer) living beings...

Preface
The Gunasthanas (stages of spiritual development) are innumerable. The Samyag-mithyadristi (right and wrong belief) Jivas (souls) are innumerable, and the Mithyadristi (wrong belief) Jivas are infinite times more than the Asanyata-samyagdristi (non-restrained right belief) Jivas. Thus, the paucity and abundance of the Gunasthanas is explained from two perspectives - with respect to entry and with respect to the duration of stay. The Gunasthanas that have no interval, i.e., the ones that are always present, their paucity and abundance is explained with respect to the duration of stay. The Gunasthanas that are always present are six - the first, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and thirteenth. For the Gunasthanas where an interval is possible, their paucity and abundance is explained with respect to both entry and duration of stay. For example, after the interval is complete, between one to fifty-four Jivas can enter the Upaśama (suppression) and Kṣapaka (destruction) series of Gunasthanas at one time, and after continuous entry for eight time units, their accumulation in each Gunasthana can range from 304 to 608. The same sequence should be understood for the fourteenth Gunasthana as well. The Sutrakara (author of the scriptures) has not mentioned the extent of entry and accumulation for the second and third Gunasthanas, which should be known from the Dhavala commentary.

Additionally, the paucity and abundance with respect to Samyaktva (right faith) is also explained for the fourth and subsequent Gunasthanas. For example, in the fourth Gunasthana, the Upaśama-samyagdristi (suppressed right belief) Jivas are the least. They are innumerable times less than the Kṣāyika-samyagdristi (destroyed right belief) Jivas, and the Vedaka-samyagdristi (realized right belief) Jivas are innumerable times more than them. The reason for this hierarchy is the increasing duration of stay. In the fifth Gunasthana, the Kṣāyika-samyagdristi Jivas are the least, because very few Kṣāyika-samyagdristi Jivas adopt Samyama-asaṃyama (restraint and non-restraint), and most of them directly adopt Samyama (restraint). In this Gunasthana, the Upaśama-samyagdristi Jivas are innumerable times more than the Kṣāyika-samyagdristi, and the Vedaka-samyagdristi Jivas are innumerable times more than them. In the sixth and seventh Gunasthanas, the Upaśama-samyagdristi Jivas are the least. They are numerically more than the Kṣāyika-samyagdristi Jivas, and the Vedaka-samyagdristi Jivas are numerically more than them. The reason for this paucity and abundance is the variation in the duration of stay. A similar paucity and abundance with respect to Samyaktva should be understood in the three Upaśamaka (suppression) Gunasthanas of Apūrvakaraṇa and others. It should be noted here that in these Gunasthanas, there are two types of Samyaktva - Upaśama-samyaktva and Kṣāyika-samyaktva, but not Vedaka-samyaktva, because the Vedaka-samyaktva Jivas cannot ascend the Upaśama series. Therefore, in the three Upaśamaka Gunasthanas of Apūrvakaraṇa and others, the Upaśama-samyaktva Jivas are the least, and the Kṣāyika-samyaktva Jivas are numerically more than them. In the subsequent Gunasthanas and the Kṣapaka (destruction) series of Gunasthanas, there is no paucity and abundance with respect to Samyaktva, because there is only one Kṣāyika-samyaktva present in all the Jivas. Similarly, in the first, second, and third Gunasthanas, there is no paucity and abundance, because Samyaktva is not present in them.

## Chapter 44: 

**The Six-Part Agama**

Just as the number of Gunasthanas (stages of spiritual progress) is mentioned in a concise manner, similarly, the Sutrakar (author of the sutras) has also presented the number of Marganasthanas (stages on the path to liberation) in a concise way. The reader will experience this conciseness while studying this chapter.

The introduction to the Chulika (appendix) has explained the subject matter of the eight chapters of the first part, called Jeevasthan (the realm of living beings). Now, the Sutrakar has also mentioned nine Chulika in this first part. These Chulika contain information that was not included in the eight Anuyogadwaras (chapters) and are related to them or are essential to know. These chapters are considered as appendices to the first part.

There are nine Chulika in the Jeevasthan part, whose names have been mentioned earlier. Here, we will introduce their subject matter one by one.

**1. Prakriti Samutkirtan Chulika:**

The various differences seen in the form of the movement, species, etc. of living beings are due to karma. What is this karma? What is its nature? And how many types of karma are there? To answer these questions, the Acharya (teacher) has created this Chulika.

The karmic particles (pudgal) that a living being binds to its own realm through its attachment and aversion (vibhav parinati) are called karma or prakriti. There are eight fundamental types of karma:

1. **Jnanavaraniy:** Karma that covers the knowledge faculty of the soul. It has five sub-types.
2. **Darshanavaraniy:** Karma that covers the perception faculty of the soul. It has nine sub-types.
3. **Vedaniy:** Karma that causes the soul to experience pleasure or pain. It has two sub-types.
4. **Mohaniy:** Karma that deludes the soul into worldly attachments. It has twenty-eight sub-types.
5. **Aayu:** Karma that keeps the living being bound in the realms of hell, heaven, and human beings. It has four sub-types.
6. **Naam:** Karma that creates the body, limbs, and form of the living being. It has forty-two sub-types in its gross form and ninety-three sub-types in its subtle form.
7. **Gotra:** Karma that determines the birth in a high or low family. It has two sub-types.
8. **Antaraya:** Karma that creates obstacles in the attainment of desired objects, enjoyment, and consumption. It has five sub-types.

Thus, this Prakriti Samutkirtan Chulika describes eight fundamental types of karma and one hundred and forty-eight sub-types.

2. After knowing the number and nature of karmas through the first chulika of the Sthanasamutkirtan Chulika, it is essential to understand how many karmic natures can be bound together and in which gunasthanas their binding is possible. This chulika discusses this very topic. For ease of explanation, the fourteen gunasthanas are divided into six parts: Mithyadristi, Sasadan Samyagdristi, Samyagmithyadristi, Asanyata Samyagdristi, Sanyata Asanyata, and Sanyata. The first five names are derived from the order of the gunasthanas, while the last name encompasses all the gunasthanas from the sixth onwards, where the binding of the desired karmic natures is possible.

The binding of all five natures of Jnanavarana karma occurs in the same place, as all beings from Mithyadristi to the tenth gunastana bind all five natures. The binding of the nine natures of Darshanavarana karma occurs in three places: 1) nine-nature form, 2) six-nature form, and 3) four-nature form. Beings in the first and second gunasthanas bind the nine-nature form. From the third gunastana to the first part of the eighth gunastana, Sanyata beings bind the six-nature form, excluding the three natures of Styanagridhi, Nidranidra, and Prachala Prachala. From the second part of the eighth gunastana to the tenth gunastana, Sanyata beings bind the four-nature form, excluding the two Nidras of Nidra and Prachala.

There is only one binding place for Vedaniya karma, as all beings from Mithyadristi to Sanyata bind both the Sata and Asata Vedaniya natures. There are ten binding places for Mohaniya karma: 22, 21, 17, 13, 9, 5, 4, 3, 2, and 1 natures. There are 28 natures of Mohaniya karma, but it is not possible for all of them to be bound together. This is because only one Veda can be bound at a time out of the three Vedas, leaving the other two Vedas unbound. Out of the two pairs of Hasya-Rati and Arati-Shoka, only one can be bound at a time, leaving the other pair unbound. Similarly, the two natures of Samyagmithyatva and Samyaktva are not bound, only their उदय (udaya) or सत्त्व (sattva) occurs. Therefore, these two also remain unbound. Thus, excluding these six natures, the remaining twenty-two natures are bound by Mithyadristi beings. Out of these twenty-two, Mithyatva is not bound in the second gunastana. Therefore, the remaining twenty-one natures are bound by Sasadan Samyagdristi.

It is important to note that even though the binding of the Napunsaka Veda does not occur in the second gunastana, the number of binding natures remains twenty-one. This is because in the first gunastana, one Veda out of the three was bound at a time, while here, excluding the Napunsaka Veda, one Veda out of the remaining two is bound. In the third and fourth gunasthanas, ...

Chhakkhandagama. The four anantānubandhi kasāyas also do not bind, so the samyagmithyādṛṣṭi and asaṃyatasamyagdṛṣṭi jīvas bind the remaining seventeen prakṛtis. It is also known here that the said two jīvas do not bind the strīveda as well, but not binding it does not make any difference in the number of prakṛtis. The saṃyatāsaṃyata jīvas bind the remaining thirteen prakṛtis, excluding the apratyākhyānāvaraṇa kasāya caturka from the said seventeen prakṛtis. Out of these thirteen prakṛtis, the pramattas aṃyata, apramattas aṃyata and apūrvakaraṇasaṃyata, these three types of saṃyatas bind the remaining nine prakṛtis, excluding the pratyākhyānāvaraṇa caturka. The anivṛttikaraṇasaṃyata binds the five prakṛtis of puruṣaveda and saṃcalana kasāya caturka. Further, the navamagunasthānavartī anivṛttikaraṇasaṃyata alone binds the remaining four prakṛtis of saṃjvalana caturka, excluding saṃcalana krodha, the remaining three prakṛtis, excluding saṃjvalana māna, the remaining two prakṛtis, and the remaining one prakṛti, excluding saṃjvalana māyā.
The four prakṛtis of āyukarma have four separate binding places - the first is for the mithyādṛṣṭi who binds nāraka āyu, the second is for the mithyādṛṣṭi and sāsādana samyagdṛṣṭi who bind tiryañca āyu, the third is for the mithyādṛṣṭi, sāsādana samyagdṛṣṭi and asaṃyatasamyagdṛṣṭi who bind manuṣya āyu, and the fourth is for the mithyādṛṣṭi, sāsādana samyagdṛṣṭi, asaṃyatasamyagdṛṣṭi, saṃyatāsaṃyata and the saṃyatas up to the seventh gunasthāna who bind deva āyu. The samyagmithyādṛṣṭi jīvas of the third gunasthāna do not bind any āyu.
Although there are 93 prakṛtis by the distinction of nāmakarma and 42 by the non-distinction, not all of them are bound by a single jīva at the same time. But a jīva can bind up to a maximum of 31 prakṛtis and at least one prakṛti. Therefore, the binding places of nāmakarma are 8 - 31, 30, 29, 28, 26, 25, 23 and 1 prakṛtis. Due to the fear of elaboration, the description of the prakṛtis of all these places and the faults of those who bind them is not given here. The readers will themselves experience the importance and vastness of this cūlikā by studying it. In brief, it should be known here that the binding of the one prakṛti of yaśaskīrti occurs in the sūkṣmasāmparāyasaṃyata of the tenth gunasthāna. The binding of the remaining seven places is done by the ekendriyas up to the pañcendriyas, as well as the devas, nāraka and up to the ninth gunasthāna.
There are only two binding places for gotrakarma - out of them, the binding of nīcagotras is done by the jīvas of the first and second gunasthānas, and the binding of ucchagotras is done by the jīvas from the first to the tenth gunasthāna.

## Introduction

[47] There is only one binding place for **antaraya karma**, as all beings from the first **guna sthana** to the tenth **guna sthana** bind all five types of **antaraya karma**.

[3] The first **maha dandaka chulika** lists 120 out of the 148 **uttar prakritis** of the eight karmas that are capable of binding. Even among these, only 117 are capable of binding in the **mithyatva guna sthana**, as the **tirthankara**, **aahara sharira**, and **aahara ka anga upanga** do not bind in this **guna sthana**. Out of these 117, a **tiryanch** or **manushya** with **mithyatva drishti** who is about to attain **samyaktv** binds only 73 **prakritis**. He does not bind the remaining 44 **ashubh prakritis**, such as **asata vedaniya**, **napumsak ved**, and **stri ved**. This being does not bind any **ayukarma** at the time of attaining **samyaktv**. Among all the sutras in this text, the second sutra of this **chulika** is the longest, hence it is called the first **maha dandaka**.

[4] The second **maha dandaka chulika** lists 67 **prakritis** that are capable of binding for **mithyatva drishti** beings of the six realms of hell, excluding the **devas** and the **narakis** of the seventh earth, who are about to attain **samyaktv**. Due to its length, it is called the second **maha dandaka**.

[5] The third **maha dandaka chulika** lists 73 **prakritis** that are capable of binding for **mithyatva drishti** **naraki** beings of the seventh earth who are about to attain **samyaktv**. Due to its length, it is called the third **maha dandaka**.

[6] The **utkrusht sthiti chulika** - After understanding the nature of **karma**, their different types, and their binding places, every practitioner will have the curiosity to know how long the bound **karma** stays with the being, whether the duration of all **karma** is the same or different, and after how much time the **karma** bears its fruit. To satisfy this curiosity, two **chulika**s named **utkrusht sthiti** and **jghanya sthiti** have been created. The **utkrusht sthiti chulika** lists the **utkrusht sthiti** of the eight **karma**. For example, the **utkrusht sthiti** of **jnana avaraniya**, **darshan avaraniya**, **vedaniya**, and **antaraya** is 30 **koda kodi sagaropama**. The **utkrusht sthiti** of **mohaniya karma** is 70 **koda kodi sagaropama**.

## Chapter 48: The Sixfold Karma

**The highest state of the Gotra karma is 20 Kodakodi Sagaropama, and the highest state of the Ayu karma is 33 Sagaropama.** Just as the highest state of the root karmas has been described, the highest states of their counter-parts have also been described in this chapter. Along with this description of the states, their unobstructed period and the period of fruition have also been described.

**The period after the binding of karma, during which it does not obstruct, i.e., does not begin to bear fruit by arising, is called the unobstructed period.** The remaining period of the karma state after this unobstructed period, during which the karma arises, bears fruit and falls away, is called the period of fruition.

**The general rule for the unobstructed period is that for a karma whose state is one Kodakodi Sagar, its unobstructed period will be 100 years.** This means that the karma will not bear fruit for 100 years, after which it will begin to bear fruit. According to this rule, the unobstructed period for karmas whose state is 30 Kodakodi Sagar is three thousand years. For those whose state is 70 Kodakodi Sagar, the unobstructed period is seven thousand years, and for those whose state is 20 Kodakodi Sagar, the unobstructed period is two thousand years.

**The rule for the unobstructed period of Ayu karma is different.** Its highest unobstructed period is one-third of a Purva Koti years at most. For karmas whose highest state is Antah Kodakodi Sagaropama or less, their unobstructed period is Antarmuhurta. The countless distinctions of Antarmuhurta, from the lowest to the highest, have been explained before. Therefore, for a karma whose state is Antah Kodakodi or less, as described in the following, the shorter the state, the shorter the Antarmuhurta of its unobstructed period should be understood.

**Chapter 7: The Lowest State**

This chapter describes the lowest state of all the root karmas and their counter-parts, their lowest unobstructed period, and their period of fruition. The lowest state of Vedaniya karma is 12 Muhurtas, the lowest state of Nama and Gotra karma is 8 Muhurtas, and the lowest state of the remaining five karmas is only Antarmuhurta. However, this lowest state of binding does not occur for every being. It occurs only for the subtle Samprayay, the tenth Gunasthan, who is climbing the ladder of क्षपकश्रेणी, at the final moment of his detachment from the binding of that nature, except for the Mohaniya and Ayu karma. The binding of the lowest state of the remaining six karmas occurs at that time.

The binding of the lowest state of Mohaniya karma, which is Antarmuhurta, occurs for the Sadhu who is climbing the क्षपकश्रेणी, at the final moment of his ninth Gunasthan. The binding of the lowest state of Ayu karma, which is Antarmuhurta, occurs for humans or Tiryanch Mithyadristi beings.

Generally, the lowest state of different natures ranges from Antarmuhurta to Antah Kodakodi Sagaropama. However, the unobstructed period for all of them is only Antarmuhurta. The remaining time should be understood as the period of fruition.

[49
The duration of the most heinous karma, which lasts only for an antarmukhurta, should be known as being proportionally very short, like an antarmukhurta.
Introduction
In these two chulikas, it is important to note that the duration of the ayukarma is not subtracted from the bound state, but its duration is only in the three parts of the remaining lifespan. Therefore, the duration of the ayukarma is as long as its bound state.
8 Samyaktvotpatti Chulikā
The most important task for this being, who has been wandering since time immemorial, is to attain samyaktv. This chulikā describes the origin of this samyaktv.
When the time of the being's worldly wandering is reduced to the amount of half a pudgala transformation, then the being becomes eligible to develop samyagdarshan, not before; this is called kalalabdhi. Even after attaining this kalalabdhi, not every being is eligible to attain samyaktv, but only the sentient five-sensed, fully pure being is eligible to attain it. This is true regardless of which of the four gatis the being belongs to. It is important to note here that all beings from the one-sensed in the tiryanch gati to the non-sentient five-sensed do not have the capacity for samyaktv because they do not have a mind, and even among the sentient five-sensed, those who are sammuchchhim sentient cannot develop the first upashma samyaktv. The remaining garbhaja five-sensed, all animals, birds, karmabhumij or bhogabhumij tiryanch, humans, gods, and naraki beings develop the first upashma samyaktv when their kshayas are mild and they are not binding intense anubhaga and excellent state karmas. However, they are binding new karmas that are in the state of antah koda-kodi sagaropama, and only karmas in that state are arising. And only karmas in that state are in existence. This is the matter of the being's internal
eligibility.
Now, the external causes must also be known: Of the beings with the above-mentioned eligibility, the naraki beings develop samyaktv for three reasons: some due to jati-smaran, some due to hearing dharma from a god or other being, and some due to the pain of suffering. The naraki beings from the fourth to the seventh hell develop samyaktv for the remaining two reasons, excluding hearing dharma. The tiryanch beings develop samyaktv for three reasons: some due to jati-smaran, some due to hearing dharma, and some due to seeing the jin-bimba. Humans also develop samyaktv for these same three reasons. The gods from the bhavan trika to the twelfth heaven develop samyaktv for four reasons: due to jati-smaran, due to hearing dharma, due to seeing the glory of the jins, and due to mahardhik

Page #63:
---------------------------
[50]
Chakkhandagama
By seeing the splendor of the Devas, the Devas from the twelfth heaven to the sixteenth heaven attain Samyaktva by the remaining three causes, leaving aside the ultimate cause. The nine Praveyakas attain Samyaktva by these two causes alone: Ahmimdra, Jatismaran and Dharmasravan. All the nine Anudish and the five Anuttaravaasi Devas are all Samyagdrsti.

Thus, upon attaining Kalalabdhi and the meeting of the aforementioned inner qualifications and external causal factors, this Jiva first attains Upshama Samyaktva. Upon the meeting of these two types of causes, his Karanalabdhi manifests, by which he strives to subdue Darshanamoha through Adhahkaran, Apurvakaran and Anivrittikaran results. The nature of these three Karans has been explained while describing the Gunasthanas. There, the restrained Jiva uses these three Karans for the subduing or destruction of Charitramoha; but here, the Saatishaya Mithyadrsti Jiva uses them for the subduing of Darshanamoha. The time duration of each Karan is Antarmuhurt, and the combined time duration of all three is also Antarmuhurt. Within these, during the time of Adhahkaran and Apurvakaran, by attaining progressive Apurva Vishuddhi, he destroys countless Karmas every moment, and after spending a large part of the Anivrittikaran time, he internalizes Darshanamohakarma, dividing it into three parts - which are named Mithyatva, Samyagmithyatva and Samyaktva-prakriti respectively. Just as when Kodas (a type of grain) are ground by a mill, they are divided into three parts - some remain as Kodas, some have their outer husks removed, some have their husks partially removed, and some have all their husks removed and become pure rice. Just as there are three parts of Darshanamoha, at that very moment, the Jiva subdues them and attains Upshama Samyaktva.

Thus, after describing the attainment of Prathamopahsama Samyaktva, the attainment of Kshayika Samyaktva is also explained in this Chulika, in which it is stated that the destruction of Darshanamohaniya begins in the Karmabhoomi and is carried out by a human being who possesses all the aforementioned qualifications, residing in the presence of one of the three: Samanya Kevali, Shruta Kevali and Tirthankara. The reason for this is that the ultimate purity and specific teachings required for attaining Kshayika Samyaktva are not possible anywhere else except in their presence. Before destroying Darshanamoha, it is necessary for him to be Vedakasamyagdrsti. He first destroys Mithyatva, then destroys Samyagmithyatva, and after that, by destroying Samyaktva-prakriti, he becomes Kshayika Samyagdrsti. If his lifespan ends while destroying this Samyaktva-prakriti, then the remaining work, however small, is completed wherever he is born in the four Gatis, and he becomes Kshayika Samyagdrsti.

## Introduction

[51] It should be noted here that if a soul attains Samyaktva after having taken birth in a particular realm, then according to the rules, it will be bound to the realm of gods. However, if a soul has taken birth in any of the four realms while in the state of Mithyatva, and later attains Samyaktva, then the bound lifespan cannot be released. Therefore, it will be born in the same realm, but due to the greatness of Samyaktva, it will not be born below hell. If a lifespan in the animal realm is bound, then it will be born as an animal. If a lifespan in the human realm is bound, then it will be born as a human. And if a lifespan in the realm of gods is bound, then it will be born as a god in the realm of Kalpa. If a soul has not taken birth in any realm and is a Charma Shariri, then after attaining Kshayik Samyaktva, it strives for the destruction of all karmas. It performs the three actions of Adhokarana, etc., and ascends the Kshapaka Shreni, ultimately destroying Moha at the end of the tenth Gunasthan. It attains Kshayik Charitra and within a moment, destroys the Avarna, Darshanavarna, and Antaraya, becoming an Arhant with the complete attainment of the four infinite qualities and the nine Kevala Jnanas. Finally, it attains liberation by destroying the remaining Aghatiya karmas through Yoga Nirodha.

_9 The Gati-Agati Chulika is the most extensive Chulika among all Chulikas. From the perspective of subject matter, it can be divided into four sections. The first section elaborates on the external causes of the attainment of Samyaktva in different realms. The second section elaborates on the realms where beings from the four realms can be reborn after death and the realms from which they can be reborn. The essence of this section is that a god cannot be reborn as a god or a hell being after death. Similarly, a hell being cannot be reborn as a hell being or a god. Beings from these two realms are reborn as humans or animals after death, and humans and animals are reborn in these two realms. However, beings from the human realm can be reborn in all four realms, and beings from all four realms can be reborn in the human realm. The third section explains which realm a being can be reborn in after death depending on the Gunasthan it is in. This section sheds light on many important and noteworthy points. For example, many beings are born in hell with Mithyatva and die with Mithyatva. Many are born in hell with Mithyatva and die with Sasadan Samyaktva. Many are born in hell with Mithyatva and die with Samyaktva. Similarly, the Gati-Agati of beings from the remaining three realms is explained. The fourth section explains that hell and...

Chakkhandagama
Devas who have come from these motions can become Tirthankaras, those who have come from other motions cannot. Chakravarti, Narayana, Prati-Narayana and Balabhadra are only those beings who have come from the Deva motion, not from the rest. Chakravarti dies and goes to heaven and hell, these two motions, and after destroying karma, also goes to liberation. Balabhadra goes to heaven or liberation. Narayana-Prati-Narayana die and according to the rule, go to hell, etc. 
After that, it has been told that the being who comes out of the seventh hell can be a Tiryanch, not a human. Those who come out of the sixth hell can be both Tiryanch and human, and among them, many beings can attain Samyaktv and Samyama-Asamyam, but not Samyam. Those who come out of the fifth hell can attain Samyam in the human birth, but cannot go to liberation from that birth. Those who come out of the fourth hell can become human, attain Samyam, and by generating Kevalgyan, can also attain Nirvana. Those who come out of the third hell can also become Tirthankaras. In the same way, by discussing in detail the ability and inability of beings who have come from the remaining motions to generate Samyaktv, Samyama-Asamyam, Samyam and Kevalgyan, this Chulika has been concluded.
Thus, with the conclusion of nine Chulika, the first chapter called Jivasthan ends.

## Introduction
## Second Section
## 2 Khuddabandh (Kshudrabandh)

This second section of the Shatkhandagama describes the eleven Anuyogadwaras through which the bondage of the soul (Jiva) is explained in the form of karma-bandhak. These are: 1. Ownership in relation to a single Jiva, 2. Time in relation to a single Jiva, 3. Space in relation to a single Jiva, 4. Dissolution and decay in relation to multiple Jivas, 5. Following the evidence of substance, 6. Following the field, 7. Following the touch, 8. Time in relation to multiple Jivas, 9. Space in relation to multiple Jivas, 10. Following the division, and 11. Following the small and the large.

At the beginning of these Anuyogadwaras, the nature of the bond is explained as a preface, and at the end, the Alpabahutva-Mahadandaka is given as a summary of all the Anuyogadwaras.

[53]

Those Jivas who bind karma are called bandhak. The nature of these bandhak Jivas is explained through fourteen Margnaas, which show which Jivas bind karma in which गति (Gati) and other Margnaas, and which do not. For example, in relation to the Gati Margnaa, all Naraki, Tiryanch, and Dev are bound by karma. However, humans are both bound and unbound by karma. This means that those who have attained the 13th Gunasthan (stage of spiritual progress) through Yoga, experience the influx of Karmanavargnaa. Even if their bondage is only for a short time, according to the Agamas, they are still considered bandhak. However, the Aayogikevali Bhagwan (liberated soul) completely lacks Yoga, so they do not experience the influx of Karmanavargnaa, nor do they have any bondage. Therefore, they are considered Abandhak (unbound).

In relation to the Indriya Margnaa, all Jivas from Ekendriya (one sense) to Chaturindriya (four senses) are bandhak. Panchendriya (five senses) Jivas are both bandhak and Abandhak. However, Anindriya (no senses) or Atiindriya (transcendent senses) Siddha Jivas are only Abandhak. In this way, the bandhak and Abandhak Jivas are considered in all Margnaas.

After that, considering ownership in relation to a single Jiva, it is explained which qualities or Paryayas (states) of which Margnaa are born from which states of the Jiva. Among these, Siddhagati, Anindriyatva, Akayattva, Aleshyattva, Ayogattva, Kshayik Samyaktv, Kevalgyan, and Kevaldarshan are born from Kshayik Labdhi (liberation). The five types of Jivas from Ekendriya to Panchendriya, Man (mind), Vachan (speech), Kay (body), these three Yogas, Mati (intellect), Shruta (scriptural knowledge), Avadhi (clairvoyance), and Man:paryaya (mind-reading), these four Gyans (knowledge), the three types of ignorance, Parihar Vishuddhi Samyama (control), Chakshu (sight), Achakshu (blindness), and Avadhi Darshan (clairvoyance), Vedak Samyaktv (right faith), Samyagmithyadrishtitva (right and wrong views), and Sanjnitva (consciousness), these are born from Kshayopa-shamik Labdhi (partial liberation). 

Apagatved (absence of wrong views), Akashaya (absence of karmic influx), Sukshma Samparaya (subtle body), and Yathakyat Samyama (control of the senses) are born from both Aupa-shamik (temporary liberation) and Kshayik Labdhi. Samayik (meditation) and Chhedopasthapana Samyama (control of the senses) are born from Aupa-shamik, Kshayik, and Kshayopa-shamik Labdhi. Aupa-shamik Samyagdarshan (temporary right faith) is born from Aupa-shamik Labdhi. Bhavyatva (potential for liberation),

Chhakhandagam
Abhavyatva and Sasadan Samyagdrstitva are parinaamik bhavas. The remaining gati, etc., all the marganantargaat jeevas, are due to the uday of their respective karmas. Anahaarakatva also occurs due to the uday of karma and also due to kshayikalabdhi.

Describing time in relation to a single jeeva, the jghan and utkrishta kalasthiti of the jeeva in each margana has been described. In jeevasthan, the description of time is done in relation to one jeeva and many jeevas in gunasthans, but here it is done in relation to only one jeeva in the marganas. Therefore, here in the description of time, the description of kayasthiti along with bhavasthiti has also been done. The state of one bhava is called bhavasthiti and the state of many bhavas without the abandonment of one kaya is called kayasthiti. For example, if the lifespan of a single tras jeeva in the present bhava is antarmuhurt praman, then this is its bhavasthiti. And if that jeeva dies as a tras, becomes a tras again, and continues to be a tras without becoming a sthavar, then it can remain a tras for more than two thousand sagaropama kalas, which is a very long time, before reaching the utkrishta koti. This is called its kayasthiti.

It is worth considering how many bhavasthitis and kayasthitis each jeeva has.

In this way, in this Khuddabandh, the number, kshetra, sparshan, kal, antar, bhaga-bhag, and alp bahutva of the jeevas who are bound by karma through the remaining anuyogadwars have been described in great detail. Its alp bahutva is unprecedented. In it, the alp bahutva of each margana is described separately, and finally, in the form of Mahadantak, the hinaadhikta of the number of jeevas in all marganas is also presented.

The reason for the many ways in which the alp bahutva of almost every margana is described in this Khuddabandh is worth investigating. It seems that A. Bhootbali first described the alp bahutva he received from his guru parampara, and then he considered it appropriate to also present the alp bahutva he received from the parampara of other acharyas.

_ After studying this section, which has such a detailed description, readers may wonder why it is called Khuddabandh even though it is so extensive? The answer is that in the sixth section of this book, A. Bhootbali has discussed bandh in great detail, and therefore it is also called Mahabandh, which is about thirty thousand shlokas long. Compared to that, this second section is small, hence it is called Khuddabandh.

## Introduction
### Third Section
This section discusses the various types of owners of bondage, i.e., the beings who bind different types of karmas. Therefore, the name "Bondage Ownership Discussion" is appropriate.

This section first uses the concept of "Gunasthanas" (stages of spiritual progress) to explain which beings bind which types of karmas and up to which Gunasthan they are found. It also explains where the bondage of those karmas is severed. For example, the five types of "Jnanavarana" (knowledge obscuration) and the four types of "Darshanavarana" (perception obscuration), including "Chakshudarshanavarana" (eye perception obscuration), along with the five types of "Yasha" (fame), "Kirti" (reputation), "Uchchagotra" (high lineage), and "Antaraya" (obstacles) - these sixteen types of karmas are bound by beings from the first Gunasthan to the tenth Gunasthan. The bondage of all these karmas is severed at the end of the tenth Gunasthan. Therefore, beings up to the tenth Gunasthan are the owners of the bondage of these sixteen types of karmas. Beings residing in Gunasthanas above the tenth are free from bondage. In this way, all the types of karmas that can be bound are described, stating that their bondage occurs up to a certain Gunasthan and not beyond.

This section can be summarized in another way: Out of the 148 types of karmas, only 120 are capable of being bound, while the remaining are not. This is because the five "Bandhanas" (bondages) and the five "Sanghatas" (aggregates) - these ten types of karmas are always bound with the body. Therefore, by including them within the body, these ten types are reduced. Similarly, the five "Rupa" (forms), five "Rasa" (tastes), two "Gandha" (smells), and eight "Sparsha" (touches) - these twenty types are considered as only four types when viewed from the perspective of "Rupa, Rasa, Gandha, Sparsha" in general. Therefore, these sixteen types are reduced. The "Darshanamohaniya" (perception-obscuring) karma does not have bondage of "Samyagmithyatva" (right-wrong perception) and "Samyaktva" (right perception) types. It only has "Udaya" (arising) and "Sattva" (existence). Therefore, these two types are reduced. In this way, by subtracting (5 + 5 + 16 + 2 = 28) twenty-eight types from 148, the remaining 120 types are capable of being bound.

Out of these, the bondage of the following sixteen types occurs only up to the first Gunasthan and not beyond: 1) "Mithyatva" (false perception), 2) "Hundakasanstahan" (state of being a fool), 3) "Napumsakaved" (knowledge of the impotent), 4) "Sripatikasanhanan" (accumulation of the body of a serpent), 5) "Ekendirijati" (one-sense being), 6) "Sthavar" (stationary being), 7) "Atap" (heat), 8) "Sukshma" (subtle), 9) "Sadharan" (ordinary), 10) "Aparayapta" (insufficient), 11) "Dwindrijati" (two-sense being), 12) "Triendrijati" (three-sense being), 13) "Chaturindrijati" (four-sense being), 14) "Narakagati" (hellish state), 15) "NarakagatyAnupurvi" (following the hellish state), 16) "Narakayu" (hellish body). Therefore, the owners of the bondage of these types are only beings with "Mithyadristi" (false perception). Beings above this level are free from bondage.

_The four "Kashayas" (poisons) - "Anantanubandhi" (infinitely connected) "Krodha" (anger), "Mana" (pride), "Maya" (deceit), "Lobha" (greed), the three "Nidra" (sleep) - "Styanagridhi" (laziness and greed), "Nidra-Nidra" (sleep-sleep), "Prachala-Prachala" (restlessness-restlessness), the three "Durbhag" (misfortune), "Dushwar" (bad voice), "Anadeya" (unworthy), and the four "Nyagrodhaparimandala" (like the banyan tree) etc. ..._

The beings beyond this are non-binders.

The binders of the four Prakritis of Hasa (laughter), Rati (attachment), Bhaya (fear), and Jugupsa (disgust) are the beings from the first Gunasthana up to the last moment of the eighth Gunasthana. The beings beyond this are non-binders.

The binders of the five Prakritis of Purusa-veda (male sex), Samjvalana-kroda (flaming anger), Mana, Maya, and Lobha are the beings from the Mithyadrsti Gunasthana up to the respective first, second, third, fourth, and fifth parts of the ninth Anivrittikarana Gunasthana.

**Bound beings from the seventh, Saataavedaniya, to the thirteenth, Sayogikevali, Gunasthanas are included. Aayogikevali is unbound.**

**Introduction**

Just as the consideration of these bound beings has been made in relation to the Gunasthanas, in the same way, in relation to the Marganasthanas, the consideration of all karma-natured bound beings, based on the possible Gunasthanas they can attain, has been presented in this section with great detail.

**Mahakarma-prakriti Praabhrut [Vedana-khand]**

In the five divisions of the twelfth, Drishtivad, Anka, the fourth division, which is called "Purvagata", has fourteen divisions. The second division of these is called "Agraayani Purva". In its fourteen "Vastu-namak" authorities, the fifth one is called "Chayanalabdhi". In its twenty "Praabhruts", the fourth one is "Mahakarma-prakriti Praabhrut". It has twenty-four authorities, whose names are as follows: 1. Kriti, 2. Vedana, 3. Sparsha, 4. Karma, 5. Prakriti, 6. Bandhan, 7. Nibandhan, 8. Prakram, 9. Upkram, 10. Uday, 11. Moksha, 12. Sankram, 13. Leshya, 14. Leshyakarma, 15. Leshyaparinam, 16. Saata-saat, 17. Deergha-hrasva, 18. Bhavadharaniy, 19. Pudgalatt (Pudgalatm), 20. Nivatt-anidhatt, 21. Nikachit-anikachit, 22. Karma-sthiiti, 23. Paschimaskandha, and 24. Alp-bahutva. A brief introduction to these authorities is as follows:

1. **Kriti - Anuyogadvaar:** This describes the creation, destruction, and creation-destruction forms of Kriti in the Audarik, Vaikriyik, Aaharak, Taijas, and Karman bodies, as well as the number of beings in the first, non-first, and final moments of existence, in the form of Kriti, No-kriti, and Avaktvy.

2. **Vedana - Anuyogadvaar:** This describes the karma-pudgalas with the "Vedana" sign, through sixteen authorities like "Vedana-nikshepa", etc. This authority is described in detail by A. Bhootbalin. This is how it got the name "Vedana-khand". Further details will be provided later.

3. **Sparsha - Anuyogadvaar:** This describes the karma-pudgalas, which have obtained eight divisions due to the eight divisions of "Jnanavaran", etc., through sixteen authorities like "Sparsha-namak", "Sparsha-nikshepa", etc., in relation to the "Sparsha-guna".

4. **Karma - Anuyogadvaar:** This discusses the pudgalas that have obtained the name "Karma" due to their ability to perform actions like covering the "Jnan", "Darshan", etc., qualities, through sixteen authorities like "Karma-nikshepa", etc.

##  Chapter 58: The Sixfold Agamas

**5. The Nature-Application Gate:** This gate elaborates on the nature and distinctions of the consequences of karma through sixteen principles, including the deposit of nature.

**6. The Bond-Application Gate:** This gate comprises four principles: bond, binder, bound, and bond-establishment. The bond principle describes the binding of the soul and karma-regions in their eternal and non-eternal forms. The binder principle examines the ownership of souls who bind karma, among other aspects, through eleven application gates. The second section of this text, *Khuddabandh*, is related to this principle. The bound principle elaborates on the categories of *pudgala* that are eligible for karma-binding, which is why this section is known as the *Vargana* section. A detailed introduction to this section will be provided later. The bond-establishment principle has four distinctions: nature-bond, state-bond, section-bond, and region-bond. These are elaborated upon in the sixth section, *Mahabhandh*.

**7. The Attachment-Application Gate:** This gate describes the attachment of root karmas and their consequences. For example, the eye sense is attached to its object, form; the ear sense is attached to sound. Similarly, the knowledge-obscuring and vision-obscuring karmas are attached to all substances, not to all states. The karmas of feeling are attached to pleasure and pain. The karmas of delusion are attached to the destruction of the true nature of the soul, which is right faith and conduct. The karmas of lifespan are attached to the determination of birth. The karmas of name are attached to the consequences of *pudgala*, the consequences of the soul, and the consequences of the region. The karmas of lineage are attached to the states of the soul, which are high and low. The karmas of hindrance are attached to the obstruction of giving and other virtuous actions. Similarly, the attachment of consequences is also considered in this application gate.

**8. The Process-Application Gate:** This gate describes the regions of karma-categories that are not yet transformed into karma but will be transformed into root nature and consequences in the future. These categories acquire distinct characteristics based on their nature, state, and section.

**9. The Initiation-Application Gate:** This gate describes four types of initiation: bond-initiation, stimulation-initiation, pacification-initiation, and transformation-initiation. Bond-initiation describes the binding of the eight karmas, including knowledge-obscuring, from the time of karma-binding until the nature, state, section, and region are established. Stimulation-initiation describes the stimulation of nature, state, section, and region. Pacification-initiation describes the complete pacification of nature, state, section, and region. Transformation-initiation describes the destruction of the region and the complete destruction of nature, state, section, and region.

## Introduction

**59. Uday-Anuyogadwar:** This chapter describes the origin of nature, state, section, and regions.

**11. Moksha-Anuyogadwar:** This chapter describes liberation, which is the state of being distinct from the soul, through the destruction of the karmic bonds of nature, state, section, and region, by means of the destruction of the karmic matter of the body and the destruction of all karmic matter. It also describes the transition, elevation, degradation, and dissolution of the state of the soul due to the influence of external karmic matter.

**12. Sankrama-Anuyogadwar:** This chapter describes the transition of nature, state, section, and region.

**13. Leshya-Anuyogadwar:** This chapter describes the six types of karmic matter: black, blue, gray, yellow, red, and white.

**14. Leshyakarma-Anuyogadwar:** This chapter explains the external actions of living beings, which are transformed by the six internal karmic matter.

**15. Leshyaparinam-Anuyogadwar:** This chapter discusses how each type of karmic matter increases and decreases.

**16. Satasat-Anuyogadwar:** This chapter describes the fourteen types of karmic bondage, based on the categories of "one" (ekant) and "many" (anekant), "bound" (sat) and "unbound" (asat). Karmic matter that is bound in a single way and remains in its state is called "ekant sat karma," and the other types of karmic matter are called "anekant sat karma." Similarly, karmic matter that is bound in a single way and remains in its state is called "ekant asat karma," and the other types of karmic matter are called "anekant asat karma."

**17. Dirgha-Hrasva-Anuyogadwar:** This chapter discusses the length and shortness of nature, state, section, and region, based on their karmic bondage. When all eight types of karmic matter are bound, it is called "prakriti dirgha" (long nature), and when fewer types of karmic matter are bound, it is called "no prakriti dirgha" (not long nature). Similarly, when one type of karmic matter is bound, it is called "prakriti hrasva" (short nature), and when more types of karmic matter are bound, it is called "no prakriti hrasva" (not short nature). The length and shortness of state, section, and region should be understood in the same way, based on their original and subsequent karmic matter.

**18. Bhavadharaniy-Anuyogadwar:** This chapter discusses the three types of existence: "ogh bhav" (existence due to karmic flow), "adesh bhav" (existence due to karmic influence), and "bhav grahan bhav" (existence due to the acceptance of karmic influence). "Ogh bhav" refers to the karmic flow of the eight types of karmic matter and the resulting state of the living being. "Adesh bhav" refers to the four types of karmic matter related to the four types of rebirth and the resulting state of the living being.

**Chhakhandagam**

The result of the order of being is called **Bhavagrahana**. When the existing lifespan melts away and a new lifespan arises, the result of the being that was born in the first instance, or the abandonment of the previous body and the assumption of a new body, is called **Bhavagrahana**. This **Bhavagrahana** is sustained by the **Ayukarma**, therefore **Ayukarma** is called **Bhavadharaniy**.

**19. Pudgalatt or Pudgalatma-Anuyogadwar** - This explains how the being assimilates **Pudgalas** through **Grahana**, **Parinam**, **Upbhog**, **Ahar**, **Mamattva**, and **Parigraha**.  

* **Grahana** refers to the **Pudgalas** assimilated through the hands, feet, etc., like the **Pudgalas** of a staff, umbrella, etc.
* **Parinam** refers to the **Pudgalas** assimilated through **Mithyatva** and other results.
* **Upbhog** refers to the **Pudgalas** assimilated through enjoyment, like fragrance, betel nut, etc.
* **Ahar** refers to the **Pudgalas** assimilated through food and drink.
* **Mamattva** refers to the **Pudgalas** assimilated through attachment.
* **Parigraha** refers to the **Pudgalas** assimilated through control.

This **Anuyogadwar** elaborates on all of these. Alternatively, **Pudgalatt** can also mean **Pudgalatma**. This **Anuyogadwar** describes the worldly beings who have attained **Pudgalatva** or **Murttatva** in relation to the **Karmavargana**-like **Pudgalas**.

**20. Nidhat-Anidhat-Anuyogadwar** - This explains the **Nidhat** and **Anidhat** states of **Prakriti**, **Sthiti**, **Anubhag**, and **Pradeshas**. The **Pradeshagra** that experiences **Utkarshana** and **Apkarshana** but not **Udirana** or transition in other **Prakriti** forms is called **Nidhat**. The **Pradeshagras** with opposite characteristics are called **Anidhat**. In this context, the meaning is that during the time of **Anivrittikarana** while **Darshanmoha** is being pacified or destroyed, only the **Darshanmohaniyakarma** becomes **Anidhat**. During the time of **Anivrittikarana** while **Anantanubandhi** is being disassociated, the **Anantanubandhi** **Kshaya Chatushk** becomes **Anidhat**. Similarly, during the time of **Anivrittikarana** while **Charitramoha** is being pacified or destroyed, all **Karmas** become **Anidhat** in the **Gunasthan**. The previously mentioned **Darshanmoha**, **Anantanubandhi Chatushk**, and the rest of the **Karmas** in their respective places are both **Nidhat** and **Anidhat**.

**21. Nikachit-Anikachit-Anuyogadwar** - This explains the **Nikachit** and **Anikachit** states of **Prakriti**, **Sthiti**, **Anubhag**, and **Pradeshas**. The **Pradeshagra** that cannot be **Utkarshana**, **Apkarshana**, **Sankraman**, or **Udirana** is called **Nikachit**. The **Pradeshas** with opposite characteristics are called **Anikachit**. In this context, the meaning is that upon entering **Anivrittikarana**, all **Karmas** become **Anikachit**. However, before that, they are both **Nikachit** and **Anikachit**.

Page #74:
---------------------------
## Introduction

**22. Karma-Sthiti-Anuyogadwar:** This describes the inferior and superior states of all karmas, and the karma-sthiti (karma state) arising from their elevation and degradation.

**23. Paschima-Skandha-Anuyogadwar:** This describes the state of the karma-skandhas (karma aggregates) in the ultimate state (Paschima, meaning the final state) at the time of the Kevali-Samudghat (the state of omniscience), including the destruction of the Sthiti-Kanda (state-section), the destruction of the Anubhag-Kanda (section of experience), Yoga-Nirodha (cessation of yoga), and Karma-Kshapan (destruction of karma).

**24. Alp-Bahutva-Anuyogadwar:** This describes the Alp-Bahutva (fewness and multitude) of jivas (living beings) based on all the aforementioned Anuyogadwars.

**4. Vedana-Khanda:** The 24 Anuyogadwars mentioned above were introduced by the Maha-Karma-Prakriti Prabhrit, but only 6 of them were described by the Acharya Bhutbali, the rest were not. Among these six Anuyogadwars, the second Anuyog, called Vedana, is described in detail, hence this Anuyogadwar became known as a separate Khanda (section). Since the Kriti Anuyogadwar is described before this, it is also considered to be part of the Vedana-Khanda.

This Vedana-Adhikar (section on Vedana) is described through 16 Anuyogadwars, their names are as follows: 1. Vedana-Nikshepa, 2. Vedana-Nay-Vibhashanata, 3. Vedana-Nama-Vidhan, 4. Vedana-Dravya-Vidhan, 5. Vedana-Kshetra-Vidhan, 6. Vedana-Kal-Vidhan, 7. Vedana-Bhav-Vidhan, 8. Vedana-Pratyay-Vidhan, 9. Vedana-Swamitva-Vidhan, 10. Vedana-Vedan-Vidhan, 11. Vedana-Gati-Vidhan, 12. Vedana-Antar-Vidhan, 13. Vedana-Sannikarsha-Vidhan, 14. Vedana-Pariman-Vidhan, 15. Vedana-Bhag-Abhag-Vidhan, and 16. Vedana-Alp-Bahutva.

**1. Vedana-Nikshepa-Anuyogadwar:** This describes the Vedana (feeling) in four ways: name, establishment, substance, and form. It explains that there are nine Aagamika-Karma-Vedanas (karmic feelings) in the Prakruti (nature).

**2. Vedana-Nay-Vibhashanata-Anuyogadwar:** This describes Vedana based on different Nays (perspectives). For example, from the perspective of Dravya-Arthika Nay (substance-based perspective), the desired Vedana is Bandha (bondage), Uday (arising), and Satva (existence). From the perspective of Riju-Suttra Nay (straight-thread perspective), the desired Vedana is the Karma-Dravya-Vedana (feeling of karmic substance) obtained at the time of Uday.

**3. Vedana-Nama-Vidhan:** This describes how different Nays are used in different situations regarding the Karma-Skandha (karma aggregate) in the Jiva (living being) in terms of Bandha, Uday, and Satva.

**4. Vedana-Dravya-Vidhan:** This explains that the Vedana-Dravya (substance of feeling) is not of one kind, but of many kinds. It also explains that the Pudgala-Skandha (substance aggregate) transformed into Vedana form is not a collection of countable or uncountable atoms, but is a collection of infinite atoms multiplied by infinite times by the Abhavya (non-liberated) and equal to the infiniteth part of the Siddha (liberated).

**5. Vedana-Kshetra-Vidhan:** This explains the field of understanding the Vedana-Dravya.

## Chapter 62: The Sixfold Path of Pain

**The Lokakasha (space of the world) is not limited in number, but is countless in extent. It extends from the smallest fraction of an angula (finger width) to the Ghanaloka (highest realm).**

1. **The Vedana-Kala-Vidhana (Doctrine of the Duration of Pain) explains how the pain-producing karmic matter (Vedana-dravya-skandha) remains with the living being for a specific duration, depending on its intensity and nature.**
2. **The Vedana-Abhava-Vidhana (Doctrine of the Absence of Pain) states that the variations in pain-related emotions are not limited to a countable, countless, or infinite number, but are infinitely infinite.**
3. **The Vedana-Pratyay-Vidhana (Doctrine of the Causes of Pain) describes the causes of pain.**
4. **The Vedana-Swamitva-Vidhana (Doctrine of the Owners of Pain) explains the owners of pain.**
5. **The Vedana-Vedan-Vidhana (Doctrine of the Experience of Pain) explains the different types of pain experienced by the bound, liberated, and partially liberated beings, using the principles of Nayas (perspectives).**
6. **The Vedana-Gati-Vidhana (Doctrine of the Movement of Pain) describes the movement of pain as static, dynamic, and both static and dynamic.**
7. **The Vedana-Antar-Vidhana (Doctrine of the Internal Nature of Pain) explains the different types of time-bound karmic influences: immediate binding, continuous binding, and both immediate and continuous binding.**
8. **The Vedana-Sannikarsha-Vidhana (Doctrine of the Proximity of Pain) describes the proximity of pain in terms of substance, space, time, and emotion, highlighting the different levels of intensity and subtlety.**
9. **The Vedana-Parimana-Vidhana (Doctrine of the Magnitude of Pain) explains the magnitude of pain in terms of time and space, differentiating between the original and subsequent natures.**
10. **The Vedana-Bhaga-Bhaga-Vidhana (Doctrine of the Division of Pain) explains the proportion of different types of pain based on their nature, duration, and spatial dependence.**
11. **The Vedana-Alpa-Bahutva-Anuyoga-Dwar (Doctrine of the Relative Abundance and Scarcity of Pain) explains the relative abundance and scarcity of these three types of pain.**

This is a brief introduction to the sixteen Anuyoga-Dwaras (Gates of Knowledge). Among them, the knowledge of the owners of pain in terms of substance, space, time, and emotion is particularly useful and important. Therefore, we will discuss it further.

**The Ownership of Pain in Substance**

A being with multiplied karmic actions is called a Gunita-Karma-Ashika. A being whose karmic actions increase progressively is called a Gunita-Karma-Ashika.

* **Earth-bodied beings (Prithvi-kayika) who have lived for a duration less than two thousand Sagaropama (a unit of time) are called Paribhrama (wanderers). They are born in the realm of the Pariapta (sufficient) and then in the realm of the Apariapta (insufficient).**
* **Those who are born in the realm of the Alpa-Ayush (short-lived) and then in the realm of the Ayush (long-lived) and who bind the Pariapta (sufficient) to a full lifespan in the shortest possible time, do so through the lowest level of karmic influence (Jghana-Yoga).**
* **Those who perform the highest level of karmic actions in the upper realms and the lowest level of karmic actions in the lower realms, are called Adhavaas (dwellers).**

**Except for the Ayukarma (lifespan karma), the owner of the highest level of pain in the remaining seven karmas (Jnanavarana, etc.) is the accumulated karmic substance (Karma-dravya) that is progressively multiplied.**

**This is revealed by the fact that a being who has reached the state of Badar Karma-Sthiti (seventy Koḍa-Koḍi Sagaropama) is born many times in the realm of the Pariapta (sufficient) and then in the realm of the Apariapta (insufficient), and lives a long lifespan in the realm of the Dirgha-Ayush (long-lived).**

## Introduction
[63]

This is (Utkarshanaapकर्षणा Aavaas). One who attains excellent yogasthana many times (Yoga Aavaas). One who attains mild sanklesha parinaamas many times (Sanklesha Aavaas). Thus, after wandering, the badar tras has arisen in many beings. While wandering among them, one who attains the aforementioned Bhava Aavaas, Adha Aavaas, Aayu Aavaas, Utkarshanaapकर्षणा Aavaas, Yoga Aavaas, and Sanklesha Aavaas many times. Thus, wandering in this way, one who is born in the Narakas of the seventh earth in the final Bhavagrahana, and being the first time-bound Aahaarak and the first time-bound Tadbhavastha, one who consumes Aahaar with excellent yoga, grows with excellent वृद्धि, and becomes complete with all पर्याप्तियों in the shortest Antarmukhurta Kaal. Afterwards, staying there for thirty-three Sagaropama Kaal, one attains excellent yogasthana many times, and also attains Ati-Sanklesha parinaamas many times. Thus, spending one's life, when a small amount of life remains, one who stays for Antarmukhurta Kaal above Yogayavamadhya, one who stays for an uncountable part of Aavali Kaal after the final Jeevagunahani sthanaantar, one who attains excellent Sanklesha in Dvicharama and Tricharma time, and one who attains excellent Yoga in Charma and Dvicharama time, such a being situated in the final time of Naraka Bhava is called Gunitakoushika. He has excellent dravya vedana of the seven karmas, namely, Jnanavaranaadi. The meaning is that the accumulation of karma-rupa dravya in the said being increases progressively until that time, and in the final time, the dravya of vedana of the seven karmas, namely, Jnanavaranaadi, is found to be the most excellent.

While describing the form of the one who has excellent dravya vedana of Aayukarma, it has been said that the being who holds an Aayu of Purvakoti years in the Jalachar beings, binds an Aayu of Purvakoti years with the long Aayubandhak Kaal, the corresponding Sanklesha, and the corresponding excellent Yoga, has stayed for Antarmukhurta Kaal above Yogayavamadhya, has stayed for an uncountable part of Aavali after the final Jeevagunahani sthanaantar, and has been born in the Jalachar beings with an Aayu of Purvakoti after dying in sequence, has become complete with all पर्याप्तियों in the shortest Antarmukhurta, binds an Aayu of Purvakoti again for the second time with the corresponding excellent Yoga in the long Aayubandhak Kaal, stays for Antarmukhurta Kaal above Yogayavamadhya, stays for an uncountable part of Aavali Kaal after the final Gunahani sthanaantar, and has been united with the time that is capable of being bound by Saata Vedaniya many times, such a being, when the binding of Aayu related to Parabhavasambandhi ends in the subsequent time, has excellent dravya vedana of Aayukarma at that time. One should know the unexcellent dravya vedana, which is different from the excellent dravya vedana of all karmas.

The being who has the least dravya vedana of Jnanavaraniya karma is said to be the Kshapitkarmaanshik being. The being whose accumulation of the desired karma dravya decreases progressively and becomes the least, is...

64] Chakkhandagama

The text states that the jiva (soul) has been wandering in the sukshmanigodiyas (subtle microscopic beings) for a period less than the asankhyataveen part of a palya (an infinitesimal unit of time). During this time, it has been born more in the aparyaptas (incomplete beings) and less in the paryaptas (complete beings). Its aparyapta duration has been longer and paryapta duration has been shorter. Whenever it binds the ayus (life-span) karma, it binds it with the utkrista (highest) yoga (activity of body, speech and mind). It attains the jaghanya (lowest) gati (state of existence) of the upari (higher) sthitis (states of existence) and the utkrista gati of the adhastha (lower) sthitis. It repeatedly attains the jaghanya yogasthana (lowest state of activity). It is repeatedly transformed by the manda (mild) sanklesha (afflictions) type of parinama (transformations).

After wandering in the sukshmanigodiyas, it was born in the badara (gross) prithvikayika (earth-bodied) paryaptas, where it became completely paryapta in the shortest duration of an antarmuhurta (moment). Then, within an antarmuhurta, it attained death and was born among the purvakotika (previous-life) ayuvala (life-span) manushyas (humans), where, after emerging from the garbha (womb), it adopted samyama (restraint) at the age of eight years. After maintaining samyama for slightly less than the purvakoti duration, as its life was about to end, it attained mithyatva (false belief).

Then, with mithyatva, it attained death and was born among the deva (celestial) beings with a lifespan of ten thousand years. There, in the shortest antarmuhurta, it became completely paryapta, and then, within an antarmuhurta, it attained samyaktva (right belief). In that deva birth, it maintained samyaktva for slightly less than ten thousand years, and then, as its life was about to end, it again attained mithyatva and, with mithyatva, attained death.

It was then born again in the badara prithvikayika paryaptas, where, in the shortest antarmuhurta, it became completely paryapta. Then, within an antarmuhurta, it attained death and was born among the sukshmanigodiyas. Through the asankhyataveen part of a palya worth of karmakshapakas (destruction of karmas), it became hatasamutpattika (destroyed the arising of karmas) and was born again in the badara prithvikayika paryaptas.

In this way, after maintaining eight samyamakaandakas (stages of restraint) through various births, and pacifying the kashayas (passions) four times, and maintaining the asankhyataveen part of a palya worth of samyamaasamakaandakas (stages of restraint and non-restraint) and the same number of samyaktvakaandakas (stages of right belief), it was born again among the purvakotika ayuvala manushyas. Here, it quickly took birth and attained the age of eight years, and then, after maintaining samyama for slightly less than the purvakoti duration, as its life was about to end, it, while in the chhadmastha (householder) state, i.e., the twelfth gunasthana (stage of spiritual development), destroyed the darshanamohiya (deluding) and charitramohiya (conduct-deluding) karmas.

At the final moment of that jiva, it experiences the jaghanya (lowest) dravyavedniya (material-experience) of the jnanavaranikakarma (knowledge-obscuring karma). The non-jaghanya vedana (experience) of other jivas should be understood.

The jiva that is the owner of the jaghanya dravyavedniya of the jnanavaranikakarma should be known as the owner of the jaghanya dravyavedniya of the darshanavaraniya (perception-obscuring) and antarayakarma (obstructive) as well. The jaghanya dravyavedniya of the mohakarma (deluding karma) should also be understood.

Preface
It should be known that in the last moment of the tenth gunasthana-residing kshapakasamyata of the aforementioned type of kshapitak-amsha jiva.

It has been explained in the answer to the query as to who is the owner of the most severe dravya-vedana of vedaniya, nama and gotra-karma, that the aforementioned kshapitak-amsha jiva, after coming up in the aforementioned manner and ascending the kshapakaśreṇī, destroys the four ghātiyā karmas and becomes a kevalī, and for the remaining part of his life span, he imparts religious discourses while wandering, and upon the exhaustion of his life, he performs all the activities of yoga-nirodha etc. and attains the final liberation of a bhavya-siddha. Thus, the most severe dravya-vedana of the three karmas belongs to such an antyasamaya-vartī ayogikevali.
The exposition of the owner of the most severe dravya-vedana of āyuḥ-karma has been given, stating that the jiva with a previous life-span of crores of previous life-spans, binds the āyuḥ-karma with the most severe yogic activity in the narakīs of the seventh bhūmi, resides there for less than an antarmuhūrta, remains in the first jīvaguṇa-hāni-sthāna for the fraction of a fraction of a fraction of time, and is then reborn in the narakīs of the seventh bhūmi. The first-moment āhārika and first-moment tadabhava-stha jiva of that jiva has acquired the āhāra through the most severe upapādana-yoga, has attained growth through the most severe vṛddhi, has become completely paryāpta through the entire long antarmuhūrta duration, has remained in the state of existence for thirty-three sāgaropama, has become associated with the duration suitable for the binding of asātā-vedanīya for a very long time, and upon the exhaustion of his life, in the next moment, the most severe dravya-vedana of the āyuḥ-karma of that narakī who will bind the āyuḥ-karma of the next life, occurs. The non-most severe dravya-vedana of the āyuḥ-karma of other jivas should be known.

The exposition of the owner of the most severe vedanā-kṣetra-svāmitva of the four ghātiyā karmas has been given, stating that the one who is situated on the outer shore of the self-manifested Ramaṇa ocean, which is one thousand yojana long, five hundred yojana wide, and two and a half hundred yojana high, and who, after creating the vedanā-samudghāta, is connected to the tanu-vāta-valaya, and then, at the same time, performs the three vigrahakaṇḍakas of the māraṇāntika-samudghāta, and is then born in the narakīs of the seventh bhūmi in the next moment, has the most severe kṣetra-vedanā of his four ghātiyā karmas. The non-most severe kṣetra-vedanā should be known as different from this most severe kṣetra-vedanā.

The exposition of the owner of the most severe kṣetra-vedanā of the four aghātiyā karmas has been given, stating that the most severe kṣetra-vedanā of the four aghātiyā karmas belongs to the Kevali Bhagavān who has attained the loka-pūraṇa-samudghāta.

##  Chhakhandagam

It is stated, while describing the characteristics of the owner of the most severe field-pain of the eight karmas, that a subtle-bodied, worthy-of-liberation, living being, who is born from the righteous path, is in the third time of becoming a tadbhava, is a present and third-time-worthy aharak, has the most severe yoga, and is filled with the most severe avagahana, experiences the most severe field-pain of all eight karmas. One should know the non-severe field-pain, which is different from this severe field-pain.

##  Ownership of Pain

It is stated, while describing the characteristics of the owner of the most severe time-pain of the remaining seven karmas, excluding the ayu karma, that a sentient, five-sense, false-vision living being, who is worthy of all perfections, is suitable for tangible use, is connected with scriptural use, is awake, and is filled with the results of the most severe state-binding, or the results of the slightly-medium-severe state-binding, experiences the most severe time-pain of all seven karmas. The above-mentioned characteristics should only be of a karma-bhoomi living being, not a bhoga-bhoomi living being; because the most severe state-binding is not possible for bhoga-bhoomi living beings. In addition, whether it is a non-karma-bhoomi deva or naraki, or a karma-bhoomi-participant, that is, a tiryanch born in the outer part of the self-luminous mountain, whether it has a lifespan of a countable number of years, or an uncountable number of years, whether it is of any of the four paths, whether it is an aquatic, terrestrial, or aerial tiryanch, one should know the non-severe time-pain, which is different from the above-mentioned severe time-pain.

It is stated, while describing the characteristics of the owner of the most severe time-pain of the ayu karma, that only those who are right-visioned, restrained humans, who are bound by the most severe deva-ayu, are the owners. Sentient, five-sense, worthy, karma-bhoomi, false-vision tiryanch and humans, both, are the owners who are bound by the most severe naraka-ayu. One should know the non-severe time-pain, which is different from this.

##  1

The most severe time-pain of jnana-avaran, darshan-avaran, and antaraya karma is experienced by the last time-worthy, subtle-passion-free, false-restrained, who is in the twelfth gunasthan. The most severe time-pain of mohaniya karma is experienced by the last time-worthy, subtle-samapray, restrained, kshapak living being, who is in the tenth gunasthan. The most severe time-pain of all four non-lethal karmas is experienced in the last time of the fourteenth gunasthan of the non-yogic kevali. One should know their non-severe time-pain, which is different from their respective severe time-pains.

##  Ownership of Pain-Feeling

It is stated, while describing the characteristics of the owner of the most severe feeling-pain of the four lethal karmas, jnana-avaran, etc., that any living being of any of the four paths, who is sentient, ...

## Introduction
[67]
A being who is endowed with five senses, has false vision, is fully equipped with all the requisites, is suitable for the use of the body, is awake, and has attained the highest degree of karmic bondage through the rules, and whose karmic bondage is of the highest degree and whose karmic substance is present, such a being, without experiencing the destruction of the karmic bondage, dies within the time of a moment and is reborn as a one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, or five-sensed being, whether conscious or unconscious. Whether it is gross or subtle, sufficient or insufficient, and whether it is born in any of the four realms, it is the owner of the highest degree of karmic pain of the four types of karmic destruction. This highest degree of karmic pain should be distinguished from the lower degree of karmic pain.

While describing the ownership of the highest degree of karmic pain of the karmas of vedaniya, name, and gotra, it has been stated that the subtle saṃpārāya-śuddha-saṃyata-kṣapaka who has bound the highest degree of the three non-destructive karmas at the end of the tenth stage of the ten stages of purification, such a subtle saṃpārāya-śuddha-saṃyata-kṣapaka at the end of his life, and the kṣīṇa-kaṣāya-vītarāga-chhadmastha, sa-yogika-kevalī, and a-yogika-kevalī who possess the substance of that highest degree of karmic bondage, should know the highest degree of karmic pain of the karmas of vedaniya, name, and gotra. Those beings who possess the remaining karmic pains other than this highest degree of karmic pain of the aforementioned karmas should be known as the owners of the lower degree of karmic pain.

While describing the ownership of the highest degree of karmic pain of the karma of āyu, it has been stated that the apramatta-saṃyata who is suitable for the use of the body, is awake, and is endowed with the purity of the corresponding use, and who has bound the highest degree of the karma of āyu, and the four types of śamana-saṃyata who ascend and descend on the śamana-śreṇī, the pramatta-saṃyata, and the deva who is born in the unreturned heavens after death, possess the highest degree of karmic pain of the karma of āyu. The lower degree of karmic pain of the karma of āyu of other beings should be known.

While describing the ownership of the lowest degree of karmic pain, it has been stated that the kṣīṇa-kaṣāya-vītarāga-chhadmastha possesses the lowest degree of karmic pain of the karmas of jñāna-āvaraṇīya, darśana-āvaraṇīya, and antarāya at the end of the twelfth stage of the twelve stages of purification. The subtle saṃpārāya-śuddha-saṃyata-kṣapaka possesses the lowest degree of karmic pain of the karma of moha at the end of the tenth stage of the ten stages of purification. The a-yogika-kevalī at the end of his life who experiences the pain of asāta-vedanīya possesses the lowest degree of karmic pain of the karma of vedaniya. The human being or the five-sensed animal who has bound the lowest degree of the karma of āyu related to the insufficiency of the requisites, and whose substance is present, possesses the lowest degree of karmic pain of the karma of āyu. The subtle nigodīya-labhya-paryāpta being who possesses the karma of hata-samutpatti and who has bound the lowest degree of the karma of name through the changing medium-sized results, and whose substance is present, possesses the lowest degree of karmic pain of the karma of name.

[68]
The **Chhakkhandagama** karma has the most severe **bhaava-vedana** (mental suffering). Any **taijaskayika** (radiant body) or **vayukayika** (air body) being who has attained **sarva-paryapti** (all-sufficiency), **saakara-upayoga** (suitable for embodiment), **jaagrut** (awakened), **sarva-vishuddha** (perfectly pure), and **hata-samutpatti** (destroyed origin) karma, and who has bound the lower **gotra** (lineage) by exciting the higher **gotra** through **udvelana** (agitation), experiences the most severe **bhaava-vedana** of **gotra-karma** (lineage karma), as does the being whose existence is being perceived. 

The **bhaava-vedana** that is different from the above-mentioned severe **bhaava-vedana** should be known as **ajaghaanya bhaava-vedana** (non-severe mental suffering).

In addition to this, three **chulikaas** (sections) have been given at the end of this **vedana-anuyogadvaara** (section on suffering) to explain the special meaning. The first **chulika** describes the 11 stages of **guna-shreni-nirjara** (degeneration of qualities) and the time taken for each stage in ascending order of brevity. The second **chulika** describes in detail the **anubhaga-bandha-adhyavasaya-sthaana** (places of determination of binding of experiences) through the twelve **anuyogadvaara** (sections). The third **chulika** describes in detail the number of beings residing in the aforementioned **anubhaga-bandha-adhyavasaya-sthaana** (places of determination of binding of experiences) through the eight **anuyogadvaara** (sections), which can only be understood by studying the original text.

Although the five **vargana-khandas** (sections on categories) are independent in the 24 **anuyogadvaara** (sections) of **maha-karma-prakriti-praabhrut** (beginning with the nature of great karma), and **Bhootbali Acharya** has also described them independently, the **bandhana-anuyogadvaara** (section on binding) describes the **pudgala-vargana** (categories of matter) in detail, taking **bandhaniya** (that which is to be bound) as the object. **Bhootbali Acharya** has not described the subsequent **anuyogadvaara** (sections). Therefore, the portion described from the **sparsha-anuyogadvaara** (section on contact) to the **bandhana-anuyogadvaara** (section on binding) is known as **vargana-khand** (section on categories).

A brief introduction to the **sparsha-anuyogadvaara** (section on contact) has already been given. This **sparsha** (contact) is of thirteen types: 1) **naama-sparsha** (name contact), 2) **sthapana-sparsha** (establishment contact), 3) **dravya-sparsha** (substance contact), 4) **ekakshetra-sparsha** (single field contact), 5) **ananta-kshetra-sparsha** (infinite field contact), 6) **desha-sparsha** (space contact), 7) **tvak-sparsha** (skin contact), 8) **sarva-sparsha** (all contact), 9) **sparsha-sparsha** (contact contact), 10) **karma-sparsha** (karma contact), 11) **bandha-sparsha** (binding contact), 12) **bhavy-sparsha** (future contact), and 13) **bhaava-sparsha** (mental contact). Their nature is described in this **anuyogadvaara** (section) in its proper place. **Karma-sparsha** (karma contact) is intended here because the subject is the binding of karma.

A brief introduction to the **karma-anuyogadvaara** (section on karma) has also been given. Karma is of ten types: 1) **naama-karma** (name karma), 2) **sthapana-karma** (establishment karma), 3) **dravya-karma** (substance karma), 4) **prayoga-karma** (application karma), 5) **samavadana-karma** (accumulation karma), 6) **adha-karma** (lower karma), 7) **iryapatha-karma** (path of movement karma), 8) **tapa-karma** (austerity karma), 9) **kriya-karma** (action karma), and 10) **bhaava-karma** (mental karma). Their nature is described in this **anuyogadvaara** (section), and it is explained that **samavadana-karma** (accumulation karma) is intended here. **Samavadana-karma** (accumulation karma) is the act of accepting karma due to **mithyatva** (false belief), **asanayama** (non-restraint), **kashaya** (passions), and **yoga** (effort).

---------------------------
Preface
The Prakritanuyogadvara extensively describes the fundamental and subsequent natures of karmas. It also provides a detailed discussion of the five types of jnanas (knowledge), which have become the foundation for the later authors.

The sixth Anuyogadvara of the Mahakarmaprakriti-prabhrita is called 'Bandhan' (bondage). Bandhan has four types: 1) Bandh, 2) Bandhak, 3) Bandhaniya, and 4) Bandhvidhan. Among these, the description of Bandhak is given in the second part called Khuddabandh, and the description of Bandhvidhan is given in the sixth part called Mahabandh. The remaining two types, Bandh and Bandhaniya, are discussed in this Anuyogadvara. Since the context of Bandhaniya involves a special deliberation on the varganas, the entire section from the Sparshanuyogadvara up to here is called the 'Varganakahand'.

1. Bandh
The first type of Bandhan is Bandh. From the perspective of Nikshep, it has four types: Nambandh, Sthapanavandh, Dravyabandh, and Bhavabandh. Naming any substance, such as jiva or ajiva, as 'this is the bandh' is called Nambandh. Establishing the notion that 'this is the bandh' in the context of tadakar and atadakar substances is called Sthapanavandh. Dravyabandh has two types: Agamdravyabandh and Noagamdravyabandh. Agamdravyabandh refers to the inappropriate bhavs, such as vachana, etc., that occur in the nine types of Agam related to the subject of bandh. Noagamdravyabandh has two types: Prayogabandh and Visrasabandh. Visrasabandh has two types: Sadivisrasabandh and Anadvivisrasabandh. The eternal bondage of the three dravyas, such as dharmastikaaya, with their respective deśas and pradeśas is called Anadvivasrasabandh. The bondage of the pudgalas with snigdha and ruksha gunas is called Sadivisrasabandh. To gain a deeper understanding of Sadivisrasabandh, a thorough study of the original text is recommended. The various types of skandhas are formed due to this Sadivisrasabandh. Prayogabandh has two types: Karmabandh and Nokarmabandh. Nokarmabandh has five types: Alāpanabandh, Allīpanabandh, Samshleshbandh, Śarīrabandh, and Śarīribandh. Binding separate substances like wood, etc., with ropes, etc., is called Alāpanabandh. The mutual bondage of various substances due to a specific coating is called Allīpanabandh. The adhesion of two substances with substances like lac, glue, etc., is called Samshleshbandh. The appropriate binding of the five śarīras is called Śarīrabandh. Śarīribandh has two types: Sadīśarīribandh and Anādīśarīribandh. The bondage of the jīva with the audārika and other śarīras is called Sadīśarīribandh. The mutual bondage of the eight madhyapradesas of the jīva is called Anādīśarīribandh. Similarly, the eternal bondage of the embodied being with karmas and nokarmas should also be understood as Anādīśarīribandh.

---------------------------
## The Sixfold Scripture (Chhakhandagam)

There are two types of **bondage** (**Bhaavbandh**): **Aagam Bhaavbandh** and **Noaagam Bhaavbandh**. 

**Aagam Bhaavbandh** refers to the appropriate emotions that arise from the nine types of **Aagam** (scriptural knowledge) like **Vaachana** (recitation), **Pricchana** (questioning), etc., as described in the **Bandh Shastra** (science of bondage).

**Noaagam Bhaavbandh** is of two types: **Jeev Bhaavbandh** and **Ajeev Bhaavbandh**.

**Jeev Bhaavbandh** (bondage of the soul) is further divided into three types: **Vipaakaj Jeev Bhaavbandh**, **Avipaakaj Jeev Bhaavbandh**, and **Tadu-bhayaroop Jeev Bhaavbandh**.

**Vipaakaj Jeev Bhaavbandh** refers to the emotions that arise from the fruition of **karma** (actions) like **Dev Bhaav** (divine state), **Manushya Bhaav** (human state), **Tiryag Bhaav** (animal state), **Naarak Bhaav** (hellish state), **Stree Ved Bhaav** (female consciousness), **Purush Ved Bhaav** (male consciousness), **Krodh Bhaav** (anger), etc.

**Avipaakaj Jeev Bhaavbandh** (non-fructified bondage of the soul) is of two types: **Aupashmik** and **Kshayik**.

**Aupashmik** refers to the subdued emotions like **Upshant Krodh** (subdued anger), **Upshant Maan** (subdued pride), etc.

**Kshayik** refers to the weakened emotions like **Ksheen Moh** (weakened attachment), **Ksheen Maan** (weakened pride), etc.

**Tadu-bhayaroop Jeev Bhaavbandh** refers to the emotions that are both **Kshaya** (weakened) and **Aupashmik** (subdued) like **Ekeindriya Labdhi** (attainment of one sense organ).

**Ajeev Bhaavbandh** (bondage of non-soul) is also of three types: **Vipaakaj**, **Avipaakaj**, and **Tadu-bhayaroop**, based on the same principles as **Jeev Bhaavbandh**.

**Vipaakaj Ajeev Bhaavbandh** refers to the colors and other characteristics that arise in the body due to the fruition of **karma** related to **Pudgal** (matter).

**Avipaakaj Ajeev Bhaavbandh** refers to the inherent colors and other characteristics present in the various **Skandhas** (aggregates) of **Pudgal**.

**Tadu-bhayaroop Ajeev Bhaavbandh** refers to the combination of both **Vipaakaj** and **Avipaakaj** characteristics.

Out of the above mentioned types of **bondage**, this text focuses on **Noaagam Dravya Bandh** (bondage of non-soul matter) and its relation to **Karma** and **NoKarma** (non-karma).

**2. Bandhak** (binder) refers to the soul that binds **Karma**. The detailed description of **Bandhak Jeev** (binder souls) is provided in the second chapter of **Aagam Bhootbaline Khudda Bandh** (scriptural text), which should be understood as part of this **Anuyogdvaar** (chapter).

**3. Bandhaniya** (bindable) refers to the **Pudgalik Karma** (material karma) and **NoKarma Skandh** (non-karma aggregates) that are separate from the soul but capable of being bound. These bound **Karma** and **NoKarma** in the form of **Pudgal Skandh** (material aggregates) become **Vedanyogya** (capable of being experienced) based on **Dravya** (substance), **Kshetra** (field), **Kaal** (time), and **Bhaav** (emotion).

Not all **Pudgal Skandh** are **Vedanyogya**. Only those **Pudgal Vargana** (categories of matter) that are **Grahan Prayogya** (capable of being grasped) become **Vedanyogya** when they are attracted by the soul through **Yog** (union), transformed into **Karma** and **NoKarma**, and bound to the soul.

**Aagam Bhootbaline** provides a detailed description of **Bandhaniya** through various **Anuyogdvaar** (chapters) and their sub-sections. Readers can experience this by studying the original text. This text provides some specific information related to **Vargana** (categories).

Preface
[The 71 Varganas are of two types - Abhyantara Vargana and Bahya Vargana. Abhyantara Vargana is also of two types - Shreni Vargana and Nanashreni Vargana. The Ekashreni Vargana has twenty-three divisions - 1. Ekapradeśika Paramāṇu Pudgala Dravya Vargana, 2. Saṃkhyātadeśika Paramāṇu Pudgala Dravya Vargana, 3. Asaṃkhyātapradeśika Paramāṇu Pudgala Dravya Vargana, 4. Anantapradeśika Paramāṇu Pudgala Dravya Vargana, 5. Āhāra Dravya Vargana, 6. Agraha Dravya Vargana, 7. Taijasa Dravya Vargana, 8. Agraha Dravya Vargana, 9. Bhāṣā Dravya Vargana, 10. Agraha Dravya Vargana, 11. Mano Dravya Vargana, 12. Agraha Dravya Vargana, 13. Kārmaṇa Dravya Vargana, 14. Dhruva Skandha Dravya Vargana, 15. Sāntara Nirantara Dravya Vargana, 16. Dhruva Śūnya Dravya Vargana, 17. Pratyeka Śarīra Dravya Vargana, 18. Dhruva Śūnya Dravya Vargana, 19. Bādara Nigoda Dravya Vargana, 20. Dhruva Śūnya Dravya Vargana, 21. Sūkṣma Nigoda Dravya Vargana, 22. Dhruva Śūnya Dravya Vargana, and 23. Mahāskandha Dravya Vargana.
The term Ekapradeśika Paramāṇu Pudgala Dravya Vargana refers to a single paramāṇu. The term Saṃkhyātapradeśika Paramāṇu Pudgala Dravya Vargana refers to all the Varganas from Dvipradeśika to the highest Saṃkhyātapradeśika Paramāṇu Pudgala Dravya Vargana. This is the second Vargana. The term Asaṃkhyātapradeśika Paramāṇu Pudgala Dravya Vargana refers to the Varganas from the lowest Jighanya Asaṃkhyātapradeśika to the highest Utkriṣṭa Asaṃkhyātapradeśika Paramāṇu Pudgala Dravya Vargana. This is the third Vargana. The term Anantapradeśika Paramāṇu Pudgala Dravya Vargana refers to all the Varganas from the lowest Jighanya Anantapradeśika to the one just before the Āhāra Vargana. This is the fourth Vargana. It is noteworthy that the Utkriṣṭa Saṃkhyātapradeśika Varganas have one less division than the Saṃkhyātapradeśika Varganas. And the number of Asaṃkhyātapradeśika Varganas is equal to the remainder when the Utkriṣṭa Asaṃkhyātā is reduced by the Utkriṣṭa Saṃkhyātā, plus one. The Asaṃkhyātapradeśika Varganas are innumerable times more than the Saṃkhyātapradeśika Varganas. The Anantapradeśika Varganas from the lowest to just before the Āhāra Vargana are also infinite in number. These four Varganas before the Āhāra Vargana are Agrahya, meaning they can never be grasped by any living being. Although the Saṃkhyātapradeśika Varganas are countable, the Asaṃkhyātapradeśika Varganas are innumerable, and the Anantapradeśika Varganas before the Āhāra Vargana are infinite, they are still referred to as one each in terms of their class.
By adding one paramāṇu to the highest Anantapradeśī Dravya Vargana, the lowest Āhāra Dravya Vargana is obtained. Further, by increasing one paramāṇu at a time and going through innumerable divisions equal to the infinite parts of the Siddhas, the highest Āhāra Dravya Vargana is obtained. This is the fifth Vargana. The paramāṇus of this Āhāra Dravya Vargana constitute the formation of the Audārika, Vaikriyika, and Āhāraka bodies. By adding one paramāṇu to the highest Āhāra Dravya Vargana, the lowest Agraha Dravya Vargana is obtained. By further increasing one paramāṇu at a time and going through innumerable divisions equal to the infinite parts of the Siddhas, the highest Agraha Dravya Vargana is obtained.

**Chhakhandagam**

The **utkrusht agrahan dravya vargana** is obtained. This vargana is also **agrahya**, meaning it is not taken in by the jiva in any form, such as the body. This is the sixth vargana.

Adding one atom to the **utkrusht agrahan dravya vargana** results in the **jghanya taijas dravya vargana**.  Further increasing by one atom at a time, and going infinitely beyond the **abhavya** (non-existent) and to the infinitely small part of the **siddha** (perfected being), the **utkrusht taijas dravya vargana** is obtained. This **taijas dravya vargana** forms the **taijas** body. This is the seventh vargana.

Adding one atom to the **taijas dravya vargana** results in the second **jghanya agrahan dravya vargana**.  Again, increasing by one atom at a time in the aforementioned order, and going infinitely beyond, the **utkrusht agrahan dravya vargana** is obtained. All these **agrahan vargana** are also **agrahya** for the jiva, and therefore not used in any function like the body. This is the eighth vargana.

Adding one atom to the aforementioned **utkrusht agrahan dravya vargana** results in the **jghanya bhasha dravya vargana**.  Again, increasing by one atom at a time in the aforementioned order, and going infinitely beyond, the **utkrusht bhasha dravya vargana** is obtained. The atoms of this **bhasha vargana** are transformed into words in various languages and spoken. This is the ninth vargana.

Adding one atom to the **utkrusht bhasha vargana** results in the third **jghanya agrahan dravya vargana**.  Again, increasing by one atom at a time in the aforementioned order, and going infinitely beyond, the **utkrusht agrahan dravya vargana** is obtained. All these **agrahan vargana** are not suitable for being taken in as language, etc., and are therefore **agrahya**. This is the tenth vargana.

Adding one atom to the aforementioned third **utkrusht agrahan dravya vargana** results in the **jghanya mano dravya vargana**.  Again, increasing by one atom at a time in the aforementioned order, and going infinitely beyond, the **utkrusht mano dravya vargana** is obtained. The atoms of this vargana form the **dravya mana** (mind). This is the eleventh vargana.

Adding one atom to the **utkrusht mano dravya vargana** results in the fourth **jghanya agrahan dravya vargana**.  Again, increasing by one atom at a time in the aforementioned order, and going infinitely beyond, the **utkrusht agrahan dravya vargana** is obtained. The atoms of this vargana are not suitable for being taken in for any function like language, mind, etc. This is the twelfth vargana.

Adding one atom to the aforementioned fourth **agrahan dravya vargana** results in the **jghanya karman dravya vargana**.  Again, increasing by one atom at a time, and going infinitely beyond,

## Translation:

**73. Excellent Karman Dravyavargna**

The 73rd Dravyavargna is obtained when the Karman Dravyavargna reaches its peak. The Pudgalaskandha of this Dravyavargna transforms into the eight Karmas, namely Jnanavarana, etc. This is the 13th Dravyavargna.

**14. Excellent Dhruvaskandha Dravyavargna**

When the Excellent Karman Dravyavargna increases by one atom, the Jghanya Dhruvaskandha Dravyavargna is obtained.  Further, with an increase of one atom at a time, and moving forward an infinite number of times the size of the space occupied by 17 Jivas, the Excellent Dhruvaskandha Dravyavargna is obtained. These Dhruvaskandha Dravyavargna are also imperceptible. This is the 14th Dravyavargna.

**15. Excellent Santaranirantar Dravyavargna**

When one atom is added to the Excellent Dhruvaskandha Dravyavargna, the Jghanya Santaranirantar Dravyavargna is obtained.  Further, with an increase of one atom at a time, and moving forward an infinite number of times the size of the space occupied by all Jivas, the Excellent Santaranirantar Dravyavargna is obtained. This is also an imperceptible Dravyavargna, as it is not suitable for the transformation of Ahar, Tej, Bhasha, etc. The atoms of this Dravyavargna are found both with and without differences, from Jghanya to Excellent. Therefore, it is called Santaranirantar Dravyavargna. This is the 15th Dravyavargna.

**Introduction**

Above the Santaranirantar Dravyavargna lies the Dhruvashunya Dravyavargna.  Above the Excellent Santaranirantar Dravyavargna, Pudgalparamanu Skandha, with one atom more, two atoms more, etc., are not found in any of the three times. However, moving forward an infinite number of times the size of the space occupied by all Jivas, the Excellent Dravyavargna of the first Dhruvashunya Dravyavargna is obtained. This is the 16th Dravyavargna, which always remains in the form of zero.

**17. Excellent Pratyekasharira Dravyavargna**

When the Dhruvashunya Dravyavargna increases by one atom, the Jghanya Pratyekasharira Dravyavargna is obtained.  Each Pratyekasharira Dravyavargna is the accumulation of Karma and Nokarma Skandha in the body of each Jiva. This Pratyekasharira is found in the bodies of Prithvikaayik, Jalakaayik, AgniKaayik, Vayukaayik, Dev, Naraki, Aharakshariri, Pramattasanyat, and Kevalijin.  Except for these eight types of Jivas, the bodies of the remaining worldly Jivas are either Pratyekarupa with a foundation (Sapratisthit) due to being established in Nigod Jivas, or they have a simple body (Sadharan Sharira) which is itself Nigod. The only exception is the plant Nigod, which is without a Nigod. This Jghanya Pratyekasharira Dravyavargna mentioned above is found in the last moment of the 14th Gunasthan of a Kshapitkarmaashik Jiva.  Moving forward an infinite number of times the size of the space occupied by all Jivas, with an increase of one atom at a time from this Jghanya Pratyekasharira Dravyavargna, the Excellent Pratyekasharira Dravyavargna is obtained, which is found in the bound AgniKaayik Jivas at the time of the burning of the Mahavana. Although all the AgniKaayik Jivas at the time of the burning of the Mahavana have their own separate independent bodies, all these Jivas and their bodies remain connected to each other, therefore, they are considered as one Dravyavargna. This is the 17th Dravyavargna.

**Chhakhandagam**

Upon an increase of one atom above the most excellent category of body-substance, the second most inferior category of Dhruva-shunya is obtained. Again, upon an increase of one atom at a time, going forward an infinite number of times beyond all living beings, the most excellent category of Dhruva-shunya is obtained. This category also remains eternally in the form of zero. This is the eighteenth category.

- Upon an increase of one atom above the most excellent category of Dhruva-shunya, the most inferior category of Badaar-nigoda is obtained. This category is obtained at the end of the twelfth Gunasthan of a Ksheen-kashya living being who has come through the Kshepit-karma-ashik method. One reason for this is that the accumulation of karma and no-karma of a living being who has come through the Kshepit-karma-ashik method gradually decreases. Another reason is that due to the purification of a living being who ascends the Kshepak-shreni, a special power is generated, which causes the first time, upon reaching the twelfth Gunasthan of that living being, the infinite Badaar-nigoda living beings situated in his body to die. The second time, even more infinite Badaar-nigoda living beings die. In this way, until the time of Avali-prithaktva-pramaan, an increasingly greater number of Badaar-nigoda living beings die every time. Beyond that, in the time of Ksheen-kashya, until the time of an uncountable fraction of Avali remains, a countable fraction more, a countable fraction more Badaar-nigoda living beings die every time. After that, in time, an uncountable number of times more Badaar-nigoda living beings die. In this way, until the end of the twelfth Gunasthan, the Badaar-nigoda living beings situated in his body die an uncountable number of times every time. Thus, the collection of karma and no-karma categories, including their Vilas-upachaya, of all the Badaar-nigoda living beings who die at the end of the twelfth Gunasthan, is called one Badaar-nigoda category. Since this is the most inferior compared to other Badaar-nigoda categories, it is called the most inferior Badaar-nigoda category at the end of the twelfth Gunasthan of a Kshepit-karma-ashik living being. In the body of the Mooli born in the Karma-bhoomi related part of the Swayambhu-raman-dweep, the most excellent Badaar-nigoda category is present. In the middle, based on the bodies of various living beings, these Badaar-nigoda categories are of countless types, from the most inferior to the most excellent. This is the nineteenth category.

Upon an increase of one atom in the most excellent Badaar-nigoda category, the third most inferior category of Dhruva-shunya is obtained. Again, upon an increase of one atom at a time above this, going forward an infinite number of times beyond all living beings, the most excellent category of Dhruva-shunya is obtained. This category also remains in the form of zero. This is the twentieth category.

Upon an increase of one atom above the said most excellent Dhruva-shunya category, the most inferior category of Sukshma-nigoda is obtained. This category is obtained through the Kshepit-kaanshi-k method and the Kshepit-ghol-maan method.

## Introduction
[75]
Here, it is important to understand that a Nigoda being does not have a single, singular body, but rather a body composed of countless Nigoda beings. There are countless Lokapramāṇa bodies forming a Pulvi, and countless Pulvis forming a Skandha. This single Skandha, containing countless Nigoda beings, is the most subtle Nigoda category, composed of the collective of Karma-Nokarma Pudgala Paramanus, along with the Audārika, Taijasa, and Kārmaṇa bodies and their Visrasa Upacaya. The most excellent Nigoda category is found in the body of a Mahāmacchha, which is a collective of six life-forms bound together. Between the most subtle and the most excellent Nigoda categories, there are countless spaces, each increasing by one Paramanu. This is the twenty-first category.

Above the most excellent Nigoda category, with an increase of one Paramanu, the fourth, most subtle Dhruvaśūnya category is attained. Again, with a gradual increase of one Paramanu, moving forward an infinite number of times greater than all beings, the most excellent Dhruvaśūnya category is attained. This is countless times greater than the most subtle. It also exists in the form of Śūnya. This is the twenty-second category.

Above the most excellent Dhruvaśūnya category, with an increase of one Paramanu, the most subtle Mahāskandhadravya category is attained. Again, with a gradual increase of one Paramanu, moving forward an infinite number of times greater than all beings, the most excellent Mahāskandha category is attained. This most excellent Mahāskandha category is the collective of all Skandhas, including the eight Earths, Tank, Kūta, Bhavana, Vimāna, Vimāneṇḍraka, Vimānaprastāra, Naraka, Narakeṇḍraka, Narakaprastāra, Guchchha, Gulma, Latā, and Tṛṇavanaspati. Although differences are visible between these Earths and others, they are all interconnected through subtle Skandhas. Therefore, all of them are collectively called Mahāskandhadravya category. This is the largest, twenty-third category.

Thus, these are all twenty-three categories. Out of these, the Āhāravargāṇa, Taijasavargāṇa, Bhāṣāvargāṇa, Manovargāṇa, and Kārmaṇavargāṇa, these five categories are taken in by the being. The rest are not, hence they are called Agrahya categories. This is the consideration of all internal categories.

The author has considered external categories through four Anuyoga doors: Śarīriśarīraprūpaṇā, Śarīraprūpaṇā, Śarīravisrasopacayaprūpaṇā, and Visrasopacayaprūpaṇā. A Śarīri is called a being. There are two types of bodies, based on their individual and general differences. The first, Śarīriśarīraprūpaṇā, elaborates on both of these. Śarīraprūpaṇā considers the five bodies, Audārika and others, along with their many sub-characteristics. Śarīravisrasopacayaprūpaṇā considers the indivisible segments of the Snigdha and Rūkṣha qualities, which are the causes of the Visrasa Upacaya of the five bodies.

## The Sixth Section of the Agamas: Mahabandha

**The Sixth Section of the Agamas, known as Mahabandha, has been explained.** It describes the process of karma particles being shed by the soul.

**Introduction to the Sixth Section:**

The second section of the Patkhaṇḍāgama briefly describes karma-bandha, hence it is known as Khuddabandha or Kṣudrabandha. However, the sixth section elaborates on the four types of bandha - nature, state, section, and region - through numerous Anuyoga-dwaras. Therefore, it is called Mahabandha.

**Bandha:**

Bandha refers to the association of karma-vargaṇās with the soul's regions due to the soul's actions driven by attachment, aversion, etc. There are four types of bandha:

* **Prakritibandha:** The nature of karma particles associated with the soul. It refers to the inherent nature of these particles to either veil the soul's knowledge, perception, etc., or to hinder its happiness.
* **Sthitibandha:** The duration for which the karma particles remain bound to the soul.
* **Anubhāgabandha:** The capacity of karma particles to produce their fruits.
* **Pradeshabandha:** The division of karma particles associated with the soul into eight types of karma (knowledge-obscuring, etc.) and their further classifications.

**The Sixth Section:**

This section elaborates on these four types of bandha in such detail that its size is five times larger than the first five sections combined. Due to its extensive nature, later Acharyas did not feel the need to write commentaries or explanations for it. It is believed to contain thirty thousand verses.

**The Lost Part of Prakritibandha:**

Although the initial parts of Mahabandha, particularly those related to Prakritibandha, have been lost due to the destruction of some palm leaves, the style of description in Sthitibandha, etc., suggests that the initial description of Prakritibandha would have been structured around twenty-four Anuyoga-dwaras. Their names are as follows:

1. **Ekājīva ki apeksha svāmityva:** Ownership in relation to one soul
2. **Apeksha bhangavichay:** Destruction of ownership in relation to one soul
3. **Bhāgābhāg:** Division of parts
4. **Bhāva:** State
5. **Alp bahul:** Few and many
6. **Prakritisamutkirtan:** Enumeration of nature
7. **Sarvabandh:** All bandha
8. **Nosarvabandh:** Not all bandha
9. **Utkṛṣṭabandh:** Superior bandha
10. **Anutkṛṣṭabandh:** Inferior bandha
11. **Jaghanyabandh:** Lowest bandha
12. **Ajaganyabandh:** Not lowest bandha
13. **Sādibāndh:** Bandha with beginning
14. **Anādibāndh:** Bandha without beginning
15. **Dhruvabandh:** Permanent bandha
16. **Adhruvabandh:** Impermanent bandha
17. **Kāla:** Time
18. **Antara:** Space
19. **Sannikarṣa:** Proximity
20. **Nānā jīvōnki:** Of many souls
21. **Parimaṇ:** Quantity
22. **Kṣetra:** Region
23. **Sparśan:** Touch
24. **Kāla:** Time
25. **Antara:** Space

## Introduction
[77]
It should be known here that Aacharya Bhootbali has also described the *sthitibandha* and *anubhagbandha* through these twenty-four *anuyogadwaras*. Only in place of the first *anuyogadwar*, *prakritisamutkirtan*, the *anuyogadwar* called *addhacched* is mentioned in the description of *sthitibandha*, and the *anuyogadwar* called *sanjna* is mentioned in the description of *anubhagbandha*. Similarly, after describing *sthitibandha* through all twenty-four *anuyogadwaras*, it is also described through the three *anuyogadwaras* of *bhujakar*, *padanikshep*, and *vriddhi*. And after describing *anubhagbandha* through the said twenty-four *anuyogadwaras*, it is also described through the four *anuyogadwaras* of *bhujakar*, *padanikshep*, *vriddhi*, and *sthan*. The description of *pradeshabandha* is also done through the said twenty-four *anuyogadwaras*. Only in place of the first *anuyogadwar*, the *anuyogadwar* called *sthan* is mentioned, and finally, *pradeshabandha* is described through five more *anuyogadwaras* of *bhujakar*, *padanikshep*, *vriddhi*, *adhyavasanasamudahar*, and *jivasamudahar*. It is important to know here that in *pradeshabandha*, the statement of *bhaga-bhaga* is made at the beginning, not in the middle.

Describing all four types of *bandhas* separately through twenty-four *anuyogadwaras* would be very extensive, therefore, the nature of all *bandhas* is described together briefly.

1. **Prakritisamutkirtan:** This *anuyogadwar* describes the number of original and subsequent *prakritis*. For example, there are eight original *karmas*: *jnanavarana*, *darshanavarana*, *vedaniya*, *mohaniya*, *ayu*, *nama*, *gotra*, and *antaraya*. Their subsequent *prakritis* are five, nine, two, twenty-eight, four, forty-two, two, and five respectively. The five *prakritis* of *jnanavarana* are described in detail in the same way as in the *prakriti* *anuyogadwar* under *varganakhand*. The number of *prakritis* of the remaining *karmas* is only mentioned in *mahabandha*, while in the *prakriti* *anuyogadwar*, all the *prakritis* of each *karma* are counted separately. Since Aacharya Bhootbali has described this in detail in the *prakriti* *anuyogadwar*, he has ended this *anuyogadwar* here by saying, "Just like *pagdibhango* and *kadavyo*."

The first *anuyogadwar* in the description of *sthitibandha* is *addhacched*. *Addha* means the time of *karma-sthiti* without obstruction and without support, and *cched* means the description of division in the form of *karma-nisheka*. The *nisheka* creation happens in the state after the unobstructed time in the total state of the *karma-pinda* that binds in one time. *Ayukarma* is an exception here, its *nisheka* creation happens in the same state as it binds. Its unobstructed time is in the *bhujyaman* *ayu* of the previous birth, therefore, the *nisheka* creation is said to be according to the complete state of the binding *ayu*.

Page #91:
---------------------------
[78]
This is the **Chakkhandagama**. In this **Anuyogadwar**, the eight root karmas and their **utkrista** and **jghan** states, their **abhadakalas** and **nishekakalas** are described in great detail.

The first **Anuyogadwar** out of the twenty-four **Anuyogadwars** that form the **Anubhagbandhaki Prarupana** is **Sanjna Prarupana**. In this **Anuyogadwar**, the nature of karmas, their power or qualities are considered by giving them specific names (**sanjna**). There are two types of **sanjna**: **Ghatisangjna** and **Sthansangjna**. In **Ghatisangjna**, the karmas are considered in terms of **sarvaghati** and **deshghati**. In **Sthansangjna**, the karmas are considered in terms of four types of places: **lata**, **daru**, **asthi**, and **shail**.

In **Pradeshabhandhaki Prarupana**, the first **Anuyogadwar** out of the twenty-four **Anuyogadwars** is **Sthan Prarupana**. It has two divisions: **Yogasthan Prarupana** and **Pradeshabhandha Prarupana**. In **Yogasthan Prarupana**, the **utkrista** and **jghan** **yogasthans** are first described in terms of the fourteen **jivasamasas** as **alpbahutva**. Then, the **pradesha alpbahutva** is considered in detail through ten **Anuyogadwars**: **Avivhagpraticchedha Prarupana**, **Varganaprarupana**, **Spardhak Prarupana**, **Antar Prarupana**, **Sthan Prarupana**, **Anantaropa Nidha**, **Paramparopa Nidha**, **Samaya Prarupana**, **Vridhi Prarupana**, and **Alpbahutva**.

The **Anuyogadwar** called **Bhaga Bhaga Prarupana** is the seventeenth out of the twenty-four **Anuyogadwars**, but in **Pradeshabhandhaki Prarupana**, the **bhaga bhaga** of karmas is considered first. The reason for this is that the division of **karmaparamanus** that come at the time of **bandha** is called **Pradeshabhandha**. Without knowing this, the true knowledge of the subsequent **Anuyogadwars** cannot be obtained. Therefore, the **acharya** considered it necessary to describe it first.

In **Bhaga Bhaga Prarupana**, it is explained that if the eight karmas are being bound at a particular time for a particular being, then out of all the **karmaparamanus** that come at that time, the **ayukarma** gets the least share, because the **sthitibandha** of **ayukarma** is the least compared to other karmas. The **nama** and **gotra** karmas get a significantly larger share than **ayukarma**. The **jnanavarana**, **darshanavarana**, and **antarayakarma** get a significantly larger share than them, and the **mohaniya karma** gets a significantly larger share than them. This is because their **sthitibandha** is progressively greater. Therefore, the division of **pradeshas** is also progressively greater. The **vedaniya karma** gets a larger share than the **mohaniya karma**, even though its **sthitibandha** is less than that of the **mohaniya karma**. The reason for this is explained as follows: it is the cause of the happiness and sorrow of beings. Therefore, its **nirjara** is very high. If there is no **vedaniya karma**, then all karmas are not capable of producing happiness and sorrow for beings. Therefore,

## Introduction
[79]
It is said that the most share goes to the one who deserves it the most. This is the order of distribution in the original natures. Similarly, the division of the karmic fields in the derived natures has been discussed in great detail. 
Now, the four types of bonds are considered together through the remaining Anuyogadwaras.

(2-3) **Sarvabandh-Nosarvabandh** - The binding of all the natures of a karma is called Sarvabandh, and the binding of less than all the natures of a karma is called Nosarvabandh.  
The binding of Jnanavarana and Antaraya karma is always Sarvabandh, never Nosarvabandh. 
The binding of Darshanavarana, Mohaniya and Nama karma can be both Sarvabandh and Nosarvabandh. 
The binding of Vedaniya, Ayu and Gotra karma is always Sarvabandh, because their natures are with opposing forces, therefore, it is not possible for all of them to be bound together in any one being at the same time. This is the description of nature-based binding. 

With respect to **Sthitibandh**, the binding of all the most excellent states of a karma is called Sarvabandh, and the binding of less than all the excellent states is called Nosarvabandh. 

With respect to **Anubhagbandh**, the binding of a karma that has all the competitors related to Anubhaga is called Sarvanubhagbandh, and the binding of a karma that has less than all the competitors is called Nosarvanubhagbandh. 

With respect to **Pradeshabhandh**, the binding of all the fields of the desired karma is called Sarvabandh, and the binding of less than all the fields is called Nosarvabandh.

(4-5) **Utkrishtbandh-Anutkrishtbandh** - It is not possible to describe the Utkrishtbandh-Anutkrishtbandh in terms of nature-based binding. 
With respect to Sthitibandh, the binding of the most excellent state of a karma is called Utkrishtbandh. For example, if the Mohaniya karma has a state of seventy kodi kodi, then the final consecration will be called Utkrisht Sthitibandh. 
All the other states, including one less than the most excellent state, will be called Anutkrisht Sthitibandh. 

With respect to Anubhagbandh, the binding of the most excellent Anubhaga is called Utkrishtbandh, and the binding of less than the most excellent Anubhaga is called Anutkrishtbandh. 

With respect to Pradeshabhandh, the binding of the most excellent fields is called Utkrishtbandh, and the binding of less than the most excellent fields is called Anutkrishtbandh.

(6-7) **Jghanyabandh-Ajghanyabandh** - It is not possible to describe the Jghanyabandh-Ajghanyabandh in terms of nature-based binding. 
With respect to Sthitibandh, the binding of the most inferior state of a karma is called Jghanyabandh, and the binding of the states above it is called Ajghanyabandh. 

With respect to Anubhagbandh, the binding of the most inferior Anubhaga is called Jghanyabandh, and the binding of more than the most inferior Anubhaga is called Ajghanyabandh. 

With respect to Pradeshabhandh, the binding of the most inferior fields is called Jghanyabandh, and the binding of more than the most inferior fields is called Ajghanyabandh.

##  Chhakhandagam (Sixfold Division)

**(8-11)**  Sadi-Anadi-Dhruva-Adhruva Prarupana - The bondage of karma which occurs once, then stops, and then occurs again is called Sadibandha. The bondage which has been occurring since the beginning of time, before the liberation of the soul, is called Anadibandha. The continuous bondage of the Abhavya (non-liberated) souls is called Dhruvabandh, and the occasional bondage of the Bhavyas (liberated souls) is called Adhruvabandh. The detailed consideration of how many of these four types of bondage occur and how many do not, based on the original and subsequent natures of karma, is discussed in the Mahabandha (Great Bondage).

**(12)**  Swamitva Prarupana - This Anuyoagdwara (section of the text) elaborates on the types of bondage based on the original and subsequent natures of karma, namely, Prakritibandha (bondage of nature), Sthitibandha (bondage of state), Anubhagabandh (bondage of experience), and Pradeshbandha (bondage of region), and the types of souls who create these bondages, categorized as Utkrishta (excellent), Anutkrishta (inferior), Jaghanya (lowest), and Ajaganya (non-lowest).

**(13)**  Kalaprarupana (Time-based Description) - This Anuyoagdwara examines the duration of the bondage of a particular karma, its state, experience, and region, categorized as Utkrishta, Anutkrishta, Jaghanya, and Ajaganya, in relation to the Gunasthan (spiritual state) and Marganasthan (path of liberation) of the soul. For example, the lowest time duration for the excellent state bondage of the Mohaniya karma (karma of delusion) is one moment, and the highest time duration for the excellent bondage is Antarmuhurt (a very short period of time). The lowest time duration for the inferior bondage is Antarmuhurt, and the highest time duration is an infinite period of time, equivalent to an immeasurable number of changes in the Pudgal (matter). The lowest time duration for the lowest state bondage is one moment, and the highest time duration is also one moment. The Ajaganya bondage has an infinite and eternal time duration.

**(14)**  Antarprrarupana (Interval Description) - This Anuyoagdwara examines the interval between the bondage of a particular karma and its subsequent occurrence. For example, the lowest interval for the excellent state bondage of the Mohaniya karma is Antarmuhurt, and the highest interval is an infinite period of time, equivalent to an immeasurable number of changes in the Pudgal. The interval for the lowest state bondage of the Mohaniya karma is not possible because the lowest state bondage occurs in the ninth Gunasthan of the soul, which is the state of the Kshapaka Shreni (those who are about to be liberated), and it is not possible for them to return to that state. The lowest interval for the Ajaganya bondage is one moment, and the highest interval is Antarmuhurt. In this way, the interval for all four types of bondage for all original and subsequent natures of karma is described in detail, based on the Ogh (stream of karma) and Aadesh (command).

**(15)**  Sannikarshaprrarupana (Proximity Description) - This Anuyoagdwara examines the other types of karma that a soul who is bound by a particular karma is also bound by, and the types of karma that they are not bound by. This is done for each type of bondage, including Prakritibandha, Sthitibandha, Anubhagabandh, and Pradeshbandha. For example, the Sthitibandha Sannikarshaprrarupana examines the other types of karma that a soul who is bound by the excellent state bondage of a particular karma is also bound by.

## Introduction
[81]
A living being who binds the state of karma binds the superior state of other karmas, or the inferior state. This consideration is taken in the delineation of the proximity of section-binding, that a living being who binds the superior section of a particular karma, at the same time binds the superior section of other karmas, or the inferior? In the delineation of the proximity of region-binding, this consideration is taken that a living being who binds the superior region-binding of the desired karma, at the same time binds the superior region-binding of other karmas, or binds the inferior region-binding. In this way, in this Anuyogadvara, the proximity of all four types of bindings of the original and the subsequent natures has been done with great detail through flow and command.
(16) The dissolution of various living beings - In this Anuyogadvara, the dissolution of four types of binding living beings has been considered in relation to various living beings. For example, in relation to nature-binding, many living beings are found who bind the karmas of knowledge-obscuration etc. at a particular time, and many are also found who are not bound. That is, living beings up to the tenth Gunasthan are always found in the form of binding of the four destructive karmas of knowledge-obscuration etc., but living beings of the eleventh and above Gunasthan are only unbound from them. In relation to state-binding, perhaps not even a single living being is found who binds the superior state of all eight karmas. Perhaps one is found, and perhaps many are found. Similarly, perhaps all living beings are bound to the inferior state of karma, perhaps one less than all are bound, and perhaps many are bound. Therefore, including the unbound, their dissolution is as follows - perhaps all are unbound from the superior state of knowledge-obscuration karma, perhaps many living beings are unbound and one living being is bound, perhaps many living beings are unbound and many living beings are bound. Similarly, the dissolution of living beings who bind the inferior, gross, and non-gross state has been considered in this Anuyogadvara. In relation to section-binding, perhaps all living beings are unbound from the superior section of all eight karmas, perhaps many living beings are unbound and one living being is bound. Perhaps many living beings are unbound and many living beings are bound. Similarly, the dissolution of living beings who bind the inferior, gross, and non-gross sections has also been considered in this Anuyogadvara. Similarly, one should know the possible dissolution of region-binding. In this way, in this Anuyogadvara, the dissolution of all four types of bindings of the original and subsequent natures has been considered with great detail through flow and command.
(17) Delineation of proportion - In this Anuyogadvara, the proportion of living beings who bind all four types of the desired karma-nature, and the proportion of living beings who are unbound from it, has been considered in this way. For example, in relation to nature-binding,

## 82]

The beings who bind themselves with the five **Jñānāvaraṇa**, nine **Darśanāvaraṇa**, one **Mithyātva**, sixteen **Kaṣāya**, **Bhaya**, **Jugupsā**, **Taijasa**, **Kārmaṇa**, **Varṇa-caturṣka**, **Aguru-laghu**, **Upghāta**, **Nirmāṇa**, and five **Antarāya** are as numerous as the infinite parts of the entire living beings, while the beings who do not bind themselves are as numerous as the infiniteth part of the entire living beings. The beings who bind themselves with **Sātāvedanīya** are as numerous as the countable part of the entire living beings, while the beings who do not bind themselves are as numerous as the countable majority of the entire living beings. The beings who bind themselves with **Asātā** are as numerous as the countable majority of the entire living beings, while the beings who do not bind themselves are as numerous as the countable part of the entire living beings. Similarly, the division of beings who bind themselves with **Sthiti-bandha**, **Anubhāga-bandha**, and **Pradeśa-bandha** has been discussed in detail in the **Guṇasthāna** and **Mārgaṇasthāna** by taking recourse to the terms **Utkṛṣṭa-anutkṛṣṭa** and **Jaghanya-ajaghanya**.

(18) **Parimāṇa-prarūpaṇā** - This **Anuyoga** describes the quantity (number) of beings who bind themselves and do not bind themselves with specific natures, specific types of **Sthiti**, specific types of **Anubhāga**, and specific types of **Pradeśa** within a given time. For example, beings who bind themselves with the five **Jñānāvaraṇa**, nine **Darśanāvaraṇa**, one **Mithyātva**, sixteen **Kaṣāya**, **Bhaya**, **Jugupsā**, **Taijasa**, **Kārmaṇa-śarīra**, **Varṇa-caturṣka**, **Aguru-laghu-caturṣka**, **Ātapa**, **Udyota**, **Nirmāṇa**, and five **Antarāya** are infinite in number, and so are the beings who do not bind themselves. Beings who bind themselves with the **Utkṛṣṭa** **Sthiti** of all eight **Karmas** are innumerable. Beings who bind themselves with the **Anutkṛṣṭa** **Sthiti** are infinite. Beings who bind themselves with the **Jaghanya** **Sthiti** of seven **Karmas** are countable, because the **Jaghanya** **Sthiti** binding occurs only in the **Kṣapaka** series. Beings who bind themselves with the **Ajaghanya** **Sthiti** are infinite. Beings who bind themselves with the **Jaghanya** and **Ajaghanya** **Sthiti** of **Āyu-karma** are infinite. Beings who bind themselves with the **Utkṛṣṭa** **Anubhāga** of the four **Ghātiya** **Karmas** are innumerable. Beings who bind themselves with the **Anutkṛṣṭa** **Anubhāga** are infinite. Beings who bind themselves with the **Jaghanya** **Anubhāga** are countable, and beings who bind themselves with the **Ajaghanya** **Anubhāga** are infinite. Beings who bind themselves with the **Utkṛṣṭa** and **Anutkṛṣṭa** **Pradeśa** of the three **Āyu** and **Vaikrīya-ṣaṭka** are innumerable. Beings who bind themselves with the **Utkṛṣṭa** and **Anutkṛṣṭa** **Pradeśa** of **Āhāra-śarīra** and **Āhāra-anga-upānga** are countable. Beings who bind themselves with the **Utkṛṣṭa** **Pradeśa** of **Tīrthaṅkara** nature are countable, and beings who bind themselves with the **Anutkṛṣṭa** **Pradeśa** are innumerable. Beings who bind themselves with the **Utkṛṣṭa** **Pradeśa** of other natures are innumerable, and beings who bind themselves with the **Anutkṛṣṭa** **Pradeśa** are infinite. Thus, the quantity of beings who bind themselves with the **Jaghanya** and **Ajaghanya** **Pradeśa** of all natures has been described in this **Anuyoga** through **Oga** and **Ādeśa**.

(19) **Kṣetra-prarūpaṇā** - This **Anuyoga** describes the present **Kṣetra** of beings who bind themselves with the four types of **Bandha** through **Jñānāvaraṇa** etc. **Karma** natures, in great detail, which can be easily understood based on the **Kṣetra-prarūpaṇā** of the **Jīvasthāna** of the present text.

Preface
[83
(20) Sparshanaprarupana - In this Anuyogadvara, the tri-temporal sparshanakshetra (sphere of touch) of the jivas who bind the karmic prakritis has been described in detail through oga and adesa. This can also be easily understood on the basis of the sparshanaprarupana of the jivasthan. The only difference here is that the present and past temporal sphere of the jivas who bind a particular prakriti is stated. In the sthitibandha, taking refuge in the uttrishta (superior), anutrishta (inferior), jaghanya (worst) and ajaghanya (not worst) states of the karmas, in the anubhagabandha, taking refuge in the uttrishta-anutrishta etc. anubhagas (intensities) of the karmas, and in the pradeshbandha, taking refuge in the uttrishta-anutrishta etc. pradesha (spatial divisions), the description of the sparshanakshetra has been done.
(21) Kalaprarupana - In this Anuyogadvara, the description of the uttrishta (superior), anutrishta (inferior), jaghanya (worst) and ajaghanya (not worst) time periods of the four types of bandhas (bondages) with respect to various jivas has been done. For example, with respect to the prakritibandha, the jivas who bind the jnanavaranadiprakritis are found in all time periods, and those who do not bind them are also found in all time periods. With respect to the sthitibandha, the jivas who bind the uttrishta state of the seven karmas have a jaghanya (worst) time period of one samaya, and the uttrishta (superior) time period is one part in the asankhyataveen part of a palya. The jivas who bind the anutrishta (inferior) state of these same karmas are found in all time periods. The jivas who bind the uttrishta state of the ayukarma have a jaghanya (worst) time period of one samaya, and the uttrishta (superior) time period is one part in the asankhyataveen part of an avali. The jivas who bind the anutrishta (inferior) state of this karma are found in all time periods. The jivas who bind the jaghanya (worst) state of all seven karmas have a jaghanya (worst) and uttrishta (superior) time period of antarmuhurta. The jivas who bind the ajaghanya (not worst) state of these same karmas have a time period that is eternal. The time period of the jivas who bind the jaghanya (worst) and ajaghanya (not worst) states of the ayukarma is eternal. With respect to the anubhagabandha, the jivas who bind the uttrishta (superior) anubhaga of the four ghatikakarmas have a jaghanya (worst) time period of one samaya and an uttrishta (superior) time period of one part in the asankhyataveen part of an avali. The jivas who bind the anutrishta (inferior) anubhaga of these karmas have an eternal time period. The jivas who bind the uttrishta (superior) anubhaga of the four aghatikakarmas have a jaghanya (worst) time period of one samaya and an uttrishta (superior) time period of sankhyata (countable) samaya. The jivas who bind the anutrishta (inferior) anubhaga of these same karmas have an eternal time period. The jivas who bind the jaghanya (worst) anubhaga of the four ghatikakarmas have a jaghanya (worst) time period of one samaya and an uttrishta (superior) time period of sankhyata (countable) samaya. The jivas who bind the ajaghanya (not worst) anubhaga of these same karmas have an eternal time period. The time period of the jivas who bind the jaghanya (worst) and ajaghanya (not worst) anubhagas of the vedaniya, ayu and namakarmans is eternal. The jivas who bind the jaghanya (worst) anubhaga of the gotrakarman have a jaghanya (worst) time period of one samaya and an uttrishta (superior) time period of one part in the asankhyataveen part of an avali. The time period of the jivas who bind the ajaghanya (not worst) anubhaga of this karma is eternal. With respect to the pradeshbandha, the jivas who bind the uttrishta (superior) pradeshbandha of the mohakarman have a jaghanya (worst) time period of one samaya and an uttrishta (superior) time period of one part in the asankhyataveen part of an avali. The time period of the jivas who bind the anutrishta (inferior) pradeshbandha is eternal. The jivas who bind the jaghanya (worst) pradeshbandha have a jaghanya (worst) time period of one samaya and an uttrishta (superior) time period of sankhyata (countable) samaya. The time period of the jivas who bind the ajaghanya (not worst) pradeshbandha is eternal. In this way, in this Anuyogadvara, the description of the time periods of all the bandhas (bondages) has been done through oga and adesa.

##  Chhakhandagam

The **Chhakhandagam** elaborates extensively on the duration of the **least** and **most** severe types of **bondage** for all four types of **bondage** (**utkrusht**, **anutkrusht**, etc.) in the **original** and **reply** natures.

**(22) Internal Differentiation:** This **anuyogadwar** does not differentiate the **bondage** of various **natures** like the five **jnanaavarana**, nine **darshanavarana**, **mithyatva**, sixteen **kashaya**, **bhaya**, **jugupsa**, **aaharaka dwika**, **taijas**, **karmanasharira**, **varna chatushk**, **agurulaghu chatushk**, **atap**, **udyot**, **nirman**, **tirthankara**, and five **antaraya** in relation to different beings. The **least** difference in **bondage** for **naraka**, **manushya**, and **devayuga** is one **samaya**, and the **most** difference is twenty-four **muhurtas**. There is no difference in **bondage** for **tiryagayuga**. There is no difference in **bondage** for the remaining **natures**.

In relation to **sthitibandha**, the **least** difference in time for beings who bind the **utkrusht** state of all eight **karmas** is one **samaya**, and the **most** difference is **asankhyata** **utsarpini** and **avsarpin** **kalapraman**. There is no difference for beings who bind the **anutkrusht** state. The **least** difference in time for beings who bind the **jghanya** state of seven **karmas** is one **samaya**, and the **most** difference is six **masas**. There is no difference for beings who bind the **ajghanya** state. There is no difference in time for beings who bind the **jghanya** and **ajghanya** states of **ayukarma**.

In relation to **anubhagbandha**, the **least** difference in time for beings who bind the **utkrusht** **anubhaga** of four **ghatiyakarma** and **ayukarma** is one **samaya**, and the **most** difference is **asankhyata** **lokapraman** **kal**. There is no difference for beings who bind the **anutkrusht** **anubhaga**. The **least** difference in time for beings who bind the **utkrusht** **anubhaga** of **vedaniya**, **nama**, and **gotrakarma** is one **samaya**, and the **most** difference is six **masas**. There is no difference for beings who bind the **anutkrusht** **anubhaga**. The **least** difference in time for beings who bind the **jghanya** **anubhaga** of four **ghatiyakarma** is one **samaya**, and the **most** difference is six **masas**. There is no difference for beings who bind the **ajghanya** **anubhaga**. There is no difference in time for beings who bind the **jghanya** and **ajghanya** **anubhaga** of **vedaniya**, **ayu**, and **namakarma**. The **least** difference in time for beings who bind the **jghanya** **anubhaga** of **gotrakarma** is one **samaya**, and the **most** difference is **asankhyata** **lokapraman**. There is no difference for beings who bind the **ajghanya** **anubhaga**.

In relation to **pradeshabandha**, the **least** difference in time for beings who bind the **utkrusht** **pradeshabandha** of all eight **karmas** is one **samaya**, and the **most** difference is **asankhyata** parts of the **jagachchreni**. There is no difference for beings who bind the **anutkrusht** **pradeshabandha**. There is also no difference in time for beings who bind the **jghanya** and **ajghanya** **pradeshabandha** of all eight **karmas**.

In this way, the **Chhakhandagam** elaborates on the duration of the **least** and **most** severe types of **bondage** for all four types of **bondage** (**utkrusht**, **anutkrusht**, etc.) in relation to the **original** and **reply** natures, with **ogh** and **adesh** (flow and command) in this **anuyogadwar**.

**(23) Differentiation of Feelings:** This **anuyogadwar** describes the **feelings** of beings who bind all four types of **bondage**. For example, in relation to **prakritibandha**, beings who bind all eight **karmas**...

## Introduction

[85] Living beings have industrial emotions. The living beings who bind the Uttar Prakritis have industrial emotions, and in relation to the Gunasthanas, the more they are not bound by those Prakritis, the more they have, as much as possible, Aupashmik, Kshayopaashmik, and Kshayik emotions. Similarly, the emotions of living beings who bind by Sthitibandha, etc., have been described in relation to Ogh and Aadesh.

[24] Alpabahutva Prarupana - In this Anuyogadwar, the Alpabahutva of the four types of living beings who bind has been described in two ways, in relation to Swasthan and Parasthan. For example, in relation to Swasthan, the living beings who are unbound by the four Darshanavaran Prakritis, namely Chakshudarshnavarana, etc., are the fewest. The living beings who are unbound by Nidra-Prachala are more than them. The living beings who are unbound by Styanatrika are more than them. The living beings who are bound by the same Styanatrika are infinite times more than them. The living beings who are bound by Nidra-Prachala are more than them. The living beings who are bound by the four Prakritis, namely Chakshudarshnavarana, etc., are more than them. Just as this is called the Swasthan Alpabahutva of Darshanavaran Karma, similarly, the Swasthan Alpabahutva of all has been described. In relation to Parasthan Alpabahutva, the living beings who bind by Aharadvika are the fewest. The living beings who bind by Tirthankara Prakriti are countless times more than them. The living beings who bind by Manushayau are countless times more than them. The living beings who bind by Narakayau are countless times more than them. The living beings who bind by Devayau are countless times more than them. The living beings who bind by Devagati are countable times more than them. The living beings who bind by Narakagati are countable times more than them. The living beings who bind by Vaikriyik Sharira are more than them. The living beings who bind by Tiryanagayau are infinite times more than them. In this way, the Alpabahutva of all the Prakritis that can be bound has been described. Similarly, the Alpabahutva of the living beings who bind by Sthiti, Anubhag, and Pradeshbandha has been described in detail in this Anuyogadwar, in relation to Ogh and Aadesh.

## Bhujakarabandha - A. Bhootbalini

After describing Sthitibandha through the twenty-four Anuyogadwars, further special descriptions of Sthitibandha have been given through the three Anuyogadwars, namely Bhujakar, Padnikshep, and Vriddhi. Binding with a lesser Sthiti at the first time and binding with a greater Sthiti at the later time is called Bhujakarabandha. From Bhujakarabandha, Alpatar, Avaasthit, and Avaktvyabandhas are also included. Binding with a greater Sthiti at the first time and binding with a lesser Sthiti at the second time is called Alpatarbandha. Binding with the same Sthiti at the second time as was bound at the first time is called Avaasthitbandha. The absence of binding of the desired Karma and binding it again is called Avaktvyabandh. This Bhujakarabandha has been described in relation to Samutkirtan, Swamitva, Kal, Antar, Bhangavichay, Bhagaabhag, Pariman, Kshetra, Sparshan, etc., in relation to different living beings.

## 86]

The thirteen *Anuyogadwaras* of Time, Interval, Emotion, and Least-Most, provide a more detailed description of *Sthitibandha*.

**Chhakkhandagam**

**Padanikṣepa:** The description of *Sthitibandha* through the three stages of Increase, Decrease, and Stability is called *Padanikṣepa*. This *Anuyogadwara* explains that if a being binds a lower *Sthiti* in the first instance and then binds a higher *Sthiti* in the second instance, how much can the binding increase at most and how much can it increase at least. Similarly, if a being binds a higher *Sthiti* in the first instance and then binds a lower *Sthiti* in the second instance, how much can the binding decrease at most and how much can it decrease at least. The stable binding that occurs after increase and decrease is called *Avashtita* binding. *Padanikṣepa* is further described through the three *Anuyogadwaras* of *Samutkirtanā*, *Swāmitva*, and *Alpबहुत्व*.

**Vṛddhi:** This *Anuyogadwara* examines *Sthitibandha* through six types of increase and decrease, similar to the thirteen *Adhikāras* of *Bhujākara* binding.

After describing the structure of *Anubhāgabandha* through twenty-four *Anuyogadwaras*, it is also described through the four *Anuyogadwaras* of *Bhujākara*, *Padanikṣepa*, *Vṛddhi*, and *Sthāna*. The nature of the first three is similar to *Sthitibandha*, except that *Anubhāga* should be used instead of *Sthiti*. After describing the structure of *Anubhāgabandha* through these three *Anuyogadwaras*, the *Sthāna* *Anuyogadwara* describes the *Adhyavasāna* *Sthānas* that are the cause of *Anubhāgabandha*, along with many other subtle aspects related to *Anubhāga* through numerous *Anuyogadwaras* like *Anantaropaṇidhā*, *Paramparopaṇidhā*, and *Tīvramandatā*.

After describing the structure of *Pradeshabandha* through twenty-four *Anuyogadwaras*, it is also described through the five *Anuyogadwaras* of *Bhujākara*, *Padanikṣepa*, *Vṛddhi*, *Adhyavasāna Samudāhara*, and *Jīva Samudāhara*. The nature of the first three is as before, except that *Pradesha* should be used instead of *Anubhāga*. *Adhyavasāna Samudāhara* describes the *Pradeshabandha* *Sthānas* and their causal *Yogasthānas*, along with their results and *Alpबहुत्व*. *Jīva Samudāhara* describes the same based on the beings who bind *Pradeshabandha*.

In this way, the Lord *Bhūtabali* has described *Prakṛti*, *Sthiti*, *Anubhāga*, and *Pradeshabandha* in great detail, hence the name of this sixth *Khaṇḍa* is known as "**Mahābandha**".

## Introduction
## Gatha Sutra
In addition to the prose Sutras, there are 5 Gatha Sutras in the Vedana Khand and 28 in the Vargana Khand, which are found in the complete recitation of the original Sutras of the Shatkhandagama. The first three Gatha Sutras are given to illustrate the concept of alpabahutva (lesser and greater) related to the sections of the Uttaraprakritis, while describing the Vedana-abhava-vidhana-anuyogadvara in the Vedana Khand. Based on these three Gatha Sutras, further Sutra-creation is done, and it is called A. Bhootbali.
(
"To us, the Maha-danda of sixty-four pada is worthy."
(Shatkhand, p. 621)
This means that now it is appropriate to discuss the Maha-danda of sixty-four pada. Subsequently, through 52 Sutras, the details of the pada of those three Gatha are described. In the Uththani-kama of this sixty-four pada, Dhwala-kar writes:
"For the benefit of those with dull intellect, Acharya Uttar-sutra explains the meaning of the Maha-danda related to alpabahutva of the excellent section, which is described by these three Gatha, containing sixty-four pada."
[87]
The first Gatha among those three Gatha Sutras is as follows:
"Sada, Jasucc, De, Kan, Te, A, Ve, Manu, Anant-guna-hina | O, Micch, Ke, Asada, Viriya, Ananta-anu-sanjalana || 1 ||"

A. Bhootbali has created 19 Sutras by taking each word or pada of this Gatha. For example:
Savva-manda-anu-bhagam, Sada, Vedaniya || 66 || Jas-gitti, Uccha-agoda, Cha, Do, Vi, Tullaani, Ata-guna-hinaani || 67 || Deva-gadi, Anant-guna-hina || 68 || Kamma-iya-sarira, Anant-guna-hina || 69 || Te-ya-sarira, Anant-guna-hina || 70 || Ahar-sarira, Anant-guna-hina || 71 || Ve-uvviya-sarira, Anant-guna-hina || 72 || Manus-gadi, Anant-guna-hina || 73 || Ora-aliya-sarira, Anant-guna-hina || 74 || Micchatt
• Anant-guna-hina || 75 || Kevala-nana-avaran-iya, Kevala-dansa-avaran-iya, Asada-vedaniya, Viriya-antara-iya, Cha, Chattar-vi-tullaani, Anant-guna-hinaani || 76 || Ananta-anu-bandhi-lobho, Anant-guna-hina || 77 || Maya-visesha-hina || 78 || Krodho, Visesha-hina || 79 || Mano, Visesha-hina || 80 || Sanjalana-ara, Lobha, Anant-guna || 81 || Maya, Visesha-hina || 82 || Kodho, Visesha-hina || 83 || Mano, Visesha-hina || 84 || (Present text, 621-22)
The purpose of giving such a large excerpt here is so that the reader can experience for themselves how, from each word of the Gatha, which is like a symbolic indication, its complete meaning is explained through prose Sutras.

Page #101:
---------------------------
## 88]
The **Chhakhandagam** is described. The **Gatha Sutra** (a type of Jain scripture) provides information about its full name through its initial letters. For example, 'Sa' stands for 'Sata Vedaniya' (seven types of sensations), 'Ja' for 'Yasha Kirti' (fame and glory), 'Uch' for 'Uchch Gotra' (high lineage), 'De' for 'Devagati' (path to liberation), 'Ka' for 'Karman Sharia' (karmic body), 'Te' for 'Taijas Sharia' (luminous body), 'Aa' for 'Aharak Sharia' (food body), 'Ve' for 'Vaikriya Sharia' (transformation body), and 'Manu' for 'Manushya Gati' (human existence). The information that all these categories have an excellent section that is infinitely multiplied and inferior is given by the word 'Anant Gunhina' (infinitely multiplied and inferior) read at the end of the first part of the Gatha.

The system of using initial letters to represent a full name has been prevalent in India since ancient times. In the **Dwadashanga Shruta** (twelve parts of Jain scriptures), such symbolic words are called 'Beejpad' (seed words). These 'Beejpad' are used to summarize a detailed description. There are many **Gatha Sutras** in the **Kasaya Pahud** (a Jain scripture) where each word signifies a vast meaning, as indicated by the Gathakar (author of the Gatha) and explained by the Vyachyanacharyas (commentators) to their disciples.

The intention of saying this is that when we look at all the prose **Sutras** of the **Shatkhandagam** in light of the above Gatha and the many Sutras based on it, and compare it with the available Jain literature, we feel like saying that the **Mahakamma Payadi Pahud** taught by Acharya Dharasen to Bhutbali and Pushpadant must have been in the form of such symbolic Gathas. This is also evident from the part of the **Dhavla Tika** (a commentary on the Shatkhandagam) where it is said that "Thus, being very satisfied, Dharasen Bhattarak started reading the 'Granth' (scripture) on an auspicious day, auspicious constellation, and auspicious day, and while explaining it in sequence, he completed the 'Granth' in the forenoon of Ashadh Shukla Ekadashi."

The part of the **Dhavla Tika** is as follows:
"Puno... Suttha Tuten Dharasen Bhandarenen Soma-Tihi-Nakkhattabare Gantho' Paraddho. Puno Kamen Vakkhananten Ashadhmas-Sukkappakkh-Ekkarasie Puvanhe 'Gantho' Samanido."
(Dhavla, p. 1, p. 70)

The word 'Granth' appearing twice in this excerpt and the word 'Vakkhanantan' are particularly noteworthy. The literal meaning of the word 'Granth' is 'a scripture that has been tied together'. This tying together of words can be in both prose and verse. There is a possibility here that the **Kasaya Pahud** etc. and the many Sutra-Gathas available in the **Shatkhandagam** mentioned above, indicate that Acharya Dharasen had received the Sutra-Gathas summarizing the vast meaning of the **Mahakammaeyadi Pahud** from the Acharya Parampara (lineage of teachers).

The 'lecture' that he gave for his two disciples. In support of this statement, I present some of these verses as evidence, which have been mentioned only by the author of the Shatkhandagama, but because their meaning is easy to understand, no separate sutra composition has been done on them. That is, these verses have been made a part of his own text. For this, see the 15 verses describing the knowledge of perception that have come within the Prakriti Anuyoga Dvara (pages 703 to 707 of the present text).

**Introduction**

The Gatha Sutra text is given in the appendix. 52 sutras have been composed on the first three verses of them (see pages 621 to 624). 56 sutras have been composed on the next three verses (see pages 624 to 627). 22 sutras have been composed on the next two verses, starting with 'Sammattappaatie' (see pages 627 to 629).

It is important to note here that the sutras composed based on these verses have been called 'Churnisutra' by Dhavalakar himself. For example:

(1) While commenting on the second sutra verse, 'Atthaminni-', a doubt has been raised: 'Katham Savvamidam Navvade?' That is, how is all this known? In the solution to this, it is said that 'Uvari Bhannamaanachurnisuttaado', that is, it is known from the Churnisutra that will be mentioned later (see Dhavala Pu. 12, pages 42-43).

(2) 'Tiy' idi Vutte Ohinaanavaraaniy
• Samaanaanam Gahanam. Kadham Samaanattaam Wade? Uvari Bhannamaanachurnisuttaado. (Dhavala Pu. 12, page 43)

This quote also raises the same doubt: how is it known that the three natures, Avadhijnanaavaraaniy, etc., are included in the word 'Tiy'? The answer is given - that it is known from the Churnisutra that will be mentioned later.

In light of the above two examples, it is undoubtedly proven that the prose sutras that have been composed to explain the meaning of these verses are being called 'Churnisutra' by Dhavalakar. Just as the sutras composed by Yativrishabhacharya to explain the meaning of the Kasayapahudu verses have been called 'Churnisutra' by him [Virasenacharya].

In addition, just as Yativrishabhacharya, while explaining the verses of Kasayapahudu, has composed Churnisutras that clarify the meaning of the verse again by saying 'Vihaasa, Vedaaditi Vihaasa' [Kasayapahudu Sutta page 764-765], in the same way, we see this same thing in many places in the Shatkhandagama, which further strengthens our statement.

**Chhakkanḍāgama**

It happens. As (1) - "Kadi kāo pagḍīo bandhadi, ti jaṁ padaṁ tassa vihāsā." [Present text, p. 259, sū. 2] (2) "Kevaḍikālatṭhidīehi kammehi sammattaṁ labbadi vā, ṇa labbadi vā ti vibhāsā." [Present text, p. 301, sū. 1].

Here, it is important to note that both the above quotations are based on the first sūtra of the first chūlikā of Jīvasthānakī. Considering the vocabulary and style of that sūtra, it is naturally imprinted on the heart that the sūtra was composed based on two gāthās. That sūtra is as follows:

"Kadi kāo payḍīo bandhadi, kevaḍikālatṭhidīehi kammehi sammattaṁ lambhadi vā ṇa labhadi vā kevacireṇa vā kāleṇa kadi bhāe vā karedi micchattaṁ, uvasāmaṇā vā khavaṇā vā kesu vā khettesu kassa vā mūle kevaḍiyaṁ vā daṁsaṇamohaṇīyaṁ kammaṁ khatassa cārittaṁ vā saṁpuṇṇaṁ-paḍivajantassa." [Present text, p. 259, sū. 1]

According to my understanding, the gāthās on which this sūtra is based should be something like this:

Kadi kāo payḍīo bandhadi kevaḍidvidīhi kammehi. Sammattaṁ labbadi vā ṇa labbadi vā [5 ṇādiyō jīvō] || 1 || Kevacireṇa vā kāleṇa kadi bhāe vā karedi micchattaṁ. Uvasāmaṇā vā khavaṇā kesu vā settesu kassa vā mūle || 2 ||

Here, it is important to note that except for the text within the brackets, all the words are from the above sūtra, from which the gāthās have been constructed.

In addition to the eight symbolic sūtra-gāthās mentioned above, 15 sūtra-gāthās are found in the Prakriti-Anuyogadwār, which describe the form of avadhi-jñāna. Most of them are found as they are, and some with minor word changes, in the Prakrit Pañcasangraha and Go. Jīvakāṇḍa. Similarly, the 9 sūtra-gāthās that come under the Bandhana Anuyogadwār are also found in the aforementioned texts. All these gāthās are found as they are, or with some word changes, in the Śvetāmbariy Āgama texts and Niyukti etc., which shows that these gāthās were being passed down through the Ācārya-paramparā even before the Śvetāmbariy-Digambariy differences arose.

The Vedana Anuyogadwarake, within the knowledge-obscuring karma, the superior substance-pain of the multiplied karma-portion-bearing living being is described. The form of this multiplied karma-portion-bearing living being is described in the Chhakhandagam in the above mentioned place in 26 sutras.

## Introduction
[93
Bhavadī || 20 ||  Thus, while transmigrating, in the last birth, in the lower realm of earth, he was born. || 21 ||  He was nourished by the first-time food, the first-time body, the excellent yoga. || 22 ||  He was increased by the excellent increase. || 23 ||  He was nourished by all the subtle and gross elements, by all the states of existence, in the last moment. || 24 ||  There, his lifespan was thirty-three oceans. || 25 ||  He went through many, many excellent yoga-grounds, while being protected by the human guardian. || 26 ||  He experienced many, many subtle defilement-results. || 27 ||  Thus, while transmigrating, in the last remnant of life, he was cut off by the excellent yoga, in the middle of the last moment. || 28 ||  In the last life, after the destruction of the life-qualities, he was cut off by the countless parts of the lifespan. || 29 ||  He went through the excellent defilement in the last-but-one and last moments. || 30 ||  He went through the excellent world in the last and last-but-one moments. || 31 ||  The excellent one was destroyed by the pain of the last-time body, the covering of the knowledge-obscuring karma. || 32 ||
(Present text 541-545)  Within this very gate of the pain-anuyoga, the lord of the gross pain of the knowledge-obscuring karma, etc., the destroyed-Kaushika being, is described. Its nature is described in the 6-part Agam through 27 sutras, while it is described in only 3 verses in the Karma-payadī. The reader should compare both.
Karma-payadī-verse 1:  By the part of the pallava-collection, the karma-bond is cut off in the subtle beings.  The yoga of becoming in the pleasant ones, like the hell, is bitter, and it is released. || 94 || 2:  In the yogas, the countless times, the perfect one obtains the country-knowledge.  The eight-limbed one, the knowledge, the joining-destruction, the three times. || 95 || 3:  The four-fold-collection, the delusion, the light, the being, the being-karma.  The crossing, there, the path, the fall, who, even with a special feature. || 96 ||
6-part Agam-sutra:  The being who is born in the subtle-jewel-womb-beings, is cut off by the karma-bond, diminished by countless parts. || 49 ||  There, the transmigrating one has many non-nourished states, and few nourished states. || 50 ||  The long ones are non-nourished states, the secret ones are nourished states. || 51 ||  Whenever he is bound, then and then he is bound by the excellent yoga of the burning-heat. || 52 ||  The upper ones, the standing ones, the destruction of the non-essential, the lower ones, the standing ones, the destruction of the essential, the excellent state. || 53 ||  Many, many destruction-yoga-grounds he goes through. || 54 ||  Many, many slow defilement-results he experiences. || 55 ||  Thus, while transmigrating, he is born in the beings of the last earth, in the nourished state. || 56 ||  He is nourished by all the subtle and gross elements, by all the states of existence, in the last moment. || 57 ||  He is born in the humans of the first-ocean, in the last moment, as the time-destroyer. || 58 ||  He is born as an eight-year-old, by the birth of the complete-destruction-exit. || 59 ||  He is taught restraint. || 60 ||  There, his lifespan is the first-ocean, and after teaching restraint to the humans, he goes to the wrong path, in the last remnant of life. || 61 ||  He is destroyed by the non-restraint of the wrong path, of the complete-destruction.

**Six-Part Canon**

|| 62 ||  The one who has gone astray (**micchatta**) is reborn among the gods who have arisen after ten thousand years of existence. || 63 ||  He is reborn in the state of **savvalada** (all-pervading) for all the days of his life, due to the **pajjatti** (actions) he has performed. || 64 ||  He is reborn in the state of **sammatta** (rightly-directed) due to the **pajjatti** (actions) he has performed. || 65 ||  If he had maintained the **sammatta** (rightly-directed) state for ten thousand years of existence, he would have lived in the state of **thovaavasese** (remaining after the end of the life span). But he went astray (**micchatta**). || 66 ||  The one who has gone astray (**micchatta**) is reborn among the **badarapuḍhavijīvapajjatti** (those who live on the earth and in the sky). || 67 ||  He is reborn in the state of **savvalahu** (all-pervading) for all the days of his life, due to the **pajjatti** (actions) he has performed. || 68 ||  The one who has gone astray (**micchatta**) is reborn among the **suhumani-godajīvapajjatti** (those who live in the heavens and on the earth). || 69 ||  He is reborn in the state of **suhumani-godajīvapajjatti** (those who live in the heavens and on the earth) after a period of time equal to an **asankhejjadhibhāga** (incalculable number of parts) of the **palidovama** (the time it takes for a **palidovama** to be reborn). This is because his karma, which was created at the time of his birth, has matured. || 70 ||  Thus, by maintaining the eight **sanjamakaṇḍaya** (restraints) in various **bhavaggahaṇa** (states of existence), and by overcoming the four **kṣāyas** (afflictions), he is reborn among the **puvakoḍau** (those who are born in the human realm) in the last **bhavaggahaṇa** (state of existence). || 71 ||  He is born as a **joṇiṇikkhāmaṇa** (one who has escaped the cycle of birth and death) after eight years of existence. || 72 ||  He is reborn in the state of **sanjama** (restraint). || 73 ||  If he had maintained the **sanjama** (restraint) for the duration of his existence, he would have lived in the state of **thovaavasese** (remaining after the end of the life span). But he was reborn in the state of **khavaṇā** (destruction). || 74 ||  He was born in the state of **carimasamayachādu-mattha** (the last moment of the life span). He experienced the **ṇāṇāvaraṇīyavedanā** (pain of the obscurations of knowledge) in the state of **carimasamayachādu-mattha** (the last moment of the life span). || 75 ||

## Introduction
[95]
The Go. Karmakanda describes the excellent and inferior states of all the original and derived natures within the bondage of karma. After that, it describes the characteristics of obstacles and the rules for removing the obstacle period of each karma, and then it explains the removal of karma without obstacles. This is appropriate considering the style of composition of the chapter there. However, it is clear that the composition of the said context of Karmakanda is indebted to the Shatkhandagama Sutras.
Here, I consider it necessary to point out that whatever description of the process of removal is found in the Shatkhandagama Sutras here or elsewhere, it is indebted to the original verses of the Karmapaydi. A comparison of one verse from the Karmapaydi and the Go. Karmakanda regarding the process of removal will not be irrelevant:
"Mothanam sagamabahang padhamai thiihi bahutaram davyam. Etto viseshiinam javukkosam ti savveshi."
(Karmapaydi, Position. Page 178)
"Abahang bolaaviya padhamani segammi dey bahugam tu. Tattho viseshiinam vidiyassaadimani seyo tti."
(Go. Karmakanda)
The secret of the similarity and difference between the two verses will be understood by the learned themselves.
In the Shatkhandagama, the description of the relative abundance of yoga is done in 28 sutras in the Dravyavidhanchulika under the Vedanakhand, while the said description is done in only 2 verses in the Karmapaydi. Here, we are quoting it for the observation of the readers:
Karmapaydi-Verse: "Savvathovo jogo saharanasuhum padhamasamayami. Bayar viyatiyachauramanasannappajjattag jahanno." 14.
"Aiyugu kkosho sim pajjattahannangethare ya kama. Ukkosajahanniyaro asamattiyare asankhaguno." 15.
Shatkhandagama-Sutra: "Savvathovo suhameindiya-appajjattayassa jahanno jogo." 145.
"Badareindiya-appajjattayassa jahanno jogo asankhejjaguno." 146.
"Biindiyaapamjattayassa jahanno jogo asankhejjaguno." 147.
"Tiindiyaappajjattayassa jahanno jogo asankhejjaguno." 148.

Chhakkhandaga
Here it should be known that the Churni of these two verses is exactly the same. The reader should compare it from there.
In the Shatkhandagama, under the same Vedanakala-vidhana Chulika, there are 10 Aniyoga-dwaras that describe the form of Yoga-sthana. Their names, etc., are found in the Karma-paydi as they are. As Karma-paydi -

## Introduction

The names of the 10 **praroopanas** in the **churni** of the said **gatha** have been listed exactly as per the words of the **sutras** of the **Shatkhandagama**.

The four **anuyogadwaras** mentioned in the **Shatkhandagama** on page 586, starting with the first **kalavidhanchulika**, are based on the **sutras** of the **praroopanas** of these four, which are derived from **gatha** 68-69 of the **kammapaydi** **sthiitibandhaprakaran**. These two **gathaas** are as follows:

1. **Thiibandhatthaanai suhumpajjattgass thovaim. Bayarasuhumeyar bitichouridiyamanasanniinam.** || 68 || **Sankhejjagunaani kama asamattiyare ya bindiyaimmi. Navaramasankhejjagunaani sankilesa ya savvatha.** || 69 ||

( **Kammapaydi** **bandhanakaran** **patra** 160)

Here, it is noteworthy that the way the **Shatkhandagama** mentions the **alpbahutva** of **sthiitibandha** **sthana** from **sutra** 37 to 50, and then the **alpbahutva** of **sanklesha** **vishuddhi** **sthana** from **sutra** 51 to 64, is also indicated by the fourth **charan** of the second **gatha**, "**sankilesa ya savvatha**". This is elaborated by **A. Bhootbalini** through the said **sutras**.

It is also important to note that, similar to the **Shatkhandagama**, the **kammapaydi** **churni** also mentions the **alpbahutva** of **sthiitibandha** **adhyavasaya** **sthana** first and then the **alpbahutva** of **sanklesha** **vishuddhi** **sthana** using the same words. This clearly shows the influence of the **sutras** of the **Shatkhandagama** on the **churni** of the **kammapaydi**.

The **alpbahutva** related to **sthiitibandha** mentioned in the **Shatkhandagama** on page 588, from **sutra** 65 to 100, is based on **gatha** 81-82 of the **kammapaydi** related to **sthiitibandha**. The **alpbahutva** mentioned in the **churni** of these **gathaas** is exactly the same as the **sutras** of the **Shatkhandagama**, except for the explanatory words of the **gatha**. For this, the **churni** is indebted to the said **sutras**. (See **Kammapaydi**, **sthiiti ban.** **patra** 174-175)

The **Shatkhandagama** on page 591, from **sutra** 101 to 122 (page 596), which is done through the two **anuyogadwaras** of **nisheka** **praroopanas**, **ananteropa nidha**, and **paramparopa nidha**, is indebted to **gatha** 83-84 of the **bandhanakaran** of the **kammapaydi**. And the **churni** of these two **gathaas** is similar to the said **sutras** of the **Shatkhandagama**, which is clearly indebted to the said **sutras**. (See **Kammapaydi**, **sthiiti ban.** **patra** 179-180)

The **Shatkhandagama**, starting from page 596, where the **ababadhakandaka** **praroopanas** begins, is based on **gatha** 85 and 86 of the **bandhanakaran** of the **kammapaydi**. The influence of all the **sutras** of this section of the **Shatkhandagama**, from **sutra** 121 to 164, is clearly visible in the **churni** of these two **gathaas**.

**Shatkhandagama**

It is evident. There is a special point within the Churni that after each Alpbahutva, its combined cause is also mentioned. For the information of the readers, two quotations are given here:

Shatkhandagama-Sutra: 
* Naanapadesagunahanitthanantaranisankhejjagunani || 127 ||
* Eyapadesagunahanitthanantaramasankhejjagunam || 128 ||
(Shatkhand, p. 597)

Kammapaydi-Churni:

(Kammapaydi. Bandhan. Patra 182)

The second Chulika, named Kalavidhan, from page 600 to 611 and Sutras 165 to 279 of Shatkhandagama, which describes the situation of the end of the bond, taking the support of three Anuyogadwaras: Jivasamudahar, Prakritisamudahar, and Sthitisamudahar, is based on the verses from 87 to 101 of the Bandhanakaran of Kammapaydi. (See Kammapaydi Bandhanakaran Patra 186 to 200). The Churni of these verses is indebted to the mentioned Sutras of Shatkhandagama. While the Sutras describe it concisely, the Churni of Kammapaydi provides a detailed explanation in the form of a commentary, which clearly proves its basis, expansion, and modernity.

On page 627 of Shatkhandagama, at the beginning of the first Chulika of Vedanaabhavavidhan, the two verses "Sammattuppattiye adi" are found exactly as they are in the Uday Adhikar of Kammapaydi at numbers 8 and 9. Also, the Churni given there is verbatim the same as the Sutras from 175 to 196 of Shatkhandagama. It is noteworthy here that the mentioned Sutras are based on the verses. This proves that the verses come from the ancient Acharya tradition. This similarity of verses and Churni is not accidental but holds a significant place in historical research.

The 23 Varganas from Ekpradeshi Vargana to Mahaskandha Vargana, described from page 733 to 735 of Shatkhandagama, are based on two verses found in the Dhavala Tika (Pu. 14, p. 117), and the same verses are also found in the Go. Jeevakand at verses 594 and 595.

These 23 categories are found in the Kammapayadi (verse 1520, Bandhanakaran Patra 39). Their characteristic is that they include clear mentions of terms like Dhruva, Shunya, etc., along with their multipliers and other details. The commentary on these three verses in the Kammapayadi is of two types: one general and the other specific. The general commentary describing the 23 categories is verbatim the same as the sutras of the Shatkhandagama. (See Kammapayadi, Bandhanakaran, Patra 39)

**Introduction**

In light of the above-mentioned quotations and similarities from the Kammapayadi, the question naturally arises: Did the author of the Shatkhandagama have access to the Kammapayadi, and did he use it as a basis for his work?

One might argue that the Shatkhandagama was composed around the 2nd or 3rd century Vikram era, while the Kammapayadi was composed by Acharya Shivsharma around the 5th century Vikram era. How then is it possible that the author of the Shatkhandagama used a work that came after his own?

The solution to this objection is that while it is true that Acharya Shivsharma is considered to have lived in the 5th century Vikram era, and that he compiled the Kammapayadi in its present form later, the following statement from the commentator of the Kammapayadi is noteworthy:

"Due to the influence of the Dushama (evil) time, the intellect, faith, enthusiasm, and effort of the Jinas are diminishing day by day. To benefit such present-day virtuous people, and to explain the meaning of the fragmented Maha-Kammapayadi-Pahud, the Acharya has composed this section called Kammapayadi-Sangahani, with the same qualities and name." (Kammapayadi, Patra 1)

This quote highlights three important points: Firstly, the subject matter is related to the Maha-Kammapayadi-Pahud, which is also the source of the Shatkhandagama. Secondly, the Maha-Kammapayadi-Pahud was fragmented at the time of the composition of the present Kammapayadi. Thirdly, its full name is "Kammapayadi-Sangahani." The word "Sangahani" added after "Kammapayadi" clearly indicates that it is a collection of the fragmented Maha-Kammapayadi-Pahud.

The portions of the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama were received from the Ācārya-paramparā, and he has collected them as they are. This is why its name 'Kammapayadīsaṅgahaṇī' is meaningful.
From the many sūtra gāthās available in the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama, it is clear that it was compiled in the Mahākammapayadīpāhuḍ gāthās. Those gāthās were received by Dharasenācārya and were also memorized. Based on them, he gave lectures to Puṣpadanta and Bhūtabali. Based on them, he composed his Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama. Due to the subject matter, he has written down the gāthās that he heard from his guru and read. Many gāthās of the Mahākammapayadīpāhuḍ, on which he based his composition of the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama, were received by Ācārya Śivasarma from the Ācārya-paramparā, and he collected them in his composition. So, can they be considered as his composition? In the Go. Jīvakāṇḍa and Karmakāṇḍa, there are hundreds of gāthās that have been circulating for a long time before their author. Just because they are collected in his Gommatasāra, they cannot be considered as composed by him.
The meaning of all the above statements is that even though the composition of Kammapayadī may be later than the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama, it contains many gāthās that have been circulating since ancient times. The Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama author had knowledge of them, and based on them, he created the sūtras of certain places. There is no objection or criticism in believing this.
The basis of Jīvasthāna
The first chapter of the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama is Jīvasthāna. Its origin is explained by Dhavalakāra in the sixth chapter of the Mahākammapayadīpāhuḍ, called Bandhana, under the fourth division of Bandhavidhāna, called Bhandhavidhāna, through various divisions and sub-divisions of the Avantara-Adhikāra. We have already clarified this through the pictures etc. given at the beginning of the introduction. The main subject of Jīvasthāna is to describe the various states of the jīva through eight forms of Sat, Saṅkhyā, etc. There is no doubt that the original source of Jīvasthāna was the Mahākammapayadīpāhuḍ. And since the bound jīva, due to the karma-bandha, does not know its form, number, etc., until then, it is not important to describe the divisions and sub-divisions of karma and their form, etc. Therefore, Bhagavat Puṣpadanta considered it appropriate to first describe the form, etc. of the jīvas through the Sat, Saṅkhyā, etc. Anuyo gadvār. In this way, the composition of the first chapter called Jīvasthāna began.
But as I have given comparative excerpts of the gāthās found in different texts composed before the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama, based on the sūtra gāthās found in the Vedana and Vargaṇākhaṇḍa,

Page #114:
---------------------------
## Introduction
[101] It has been stated that the subject matter of the Maha-kamma-payādi-pāhuḍa was very extensive, and it was being transmitted through the Acharya-parampara in the form of gāthās, which were composed or compiled for easy memorization. The portion of it that was received by Acharya Śivasarma was collected by him in his 'Kamma-payādi-sangahaṇī'. Similarly, the Acharyas who preceded him, received the subject matter from their Guru-parampara, and they compiled it in gāthās so that the inquisitive people could memorize it. 

Upon examining all the available Jain literature, our attention was drawn to a text that bears complete resemblance to the first part of the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama, Jīvasthāna, in terms of its style of composition. The author of this text is still unknown, but it is known as the Pūrva-bhṛt-sūri-sūtrita. Its name is Jīvasamāsa. 

* It contains a total of 286 gāthās and describes the Jīva in the same way as the first part of the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama, Jīvasthāna, through the same eight Anuyoga-dvāras, namely Satyarūpaṇā, Dravya-pramāṇānugam, etc. The only difference is that while describing the Jīva in the Jīvasamāsa, it mentions one or two Mārgṇās by way of instruction and states that the Dhira, Vira, and Śruta-jñāna people should infer the rest of the Mārgṇās. However, in the Jīvasthāna of the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama, a detailed description of all the Mārgṇā-sthānas is found in each Prarūpaṇā. This is the reason why the description that is given in 286 gāthās here is given in 1860 sūtras in the Jīvasthāna.

In the Jīvasamāsa, before describing the eight Prarūpaṇās in detail and by way of instruction, a detailed discussion of many fundamental aspects of each Prarūpaṇā is given, which is not found in the Jīvasthāna. However, it is found in the Dhavala Tīkā. There are about 111 gāthās in total that deal with such specific topics. After subtracting them from 286, only 175 gāthās remain, which contain a detailed and clear description of the eight Prarūpaṇās in the form of sūtras. This leads to the conclusion that the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama-kāra has explained these 175 gāthās in 1860 sūtras.

Here, one may doubt that the Jīvasamāsa-kāra might have summarized the detailed and extensive description of the Jīvasthāna of the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama. Just as the author of the Gommaṭasāra, Nemicandra-ācārya, summarized the Dhavala and Jayadhavala Tīkās. However, the solution to this doubt is that firstly, the author of the Gommaṭasāra has clearly mentioned his name in it. 

* This has been published in its original form along with a collection of various texts.

**Chakkhandagam**

This is a work whose later composition is established. However, here, the author of the *Jivasamas* has not mentioned his name anywhere, nor have the later Acharyas mentioned it as the work of a particular Acharya. Rather, it is called "**Purvabhrit-Suri-Sutrit**", which means that when the knowledge of the *Purvas* was prevalent, a previous knowledgeable Acharya, seeing the declining intellect and comprehension of the people, was motivated by compassion and compiled it in the form of verses. This work, flowing through the Acharya tradition, reached Dharasena Acharya. He did not focus on explaining the clear statements in it, but rather elaborated on the hidden meaning of the *Marganas* that were not explained. He discussed them in detail with Bhutbali and Pushpadanta, and they too considered it appropriate to clarify and express this hidden secret in their own works.

Secondly, the verses of this *Jivasamas*, which are the foundation of the eight *Prarupanas*, are found in many texts besides the *Dhavla Tika*, such as the *Uttaraadhyayana*, *Mulachara*, *Acharaanga-Niyukti*, *Prajnapanasutra*, *Prakrit Panchasangrah*, etc. Considering the well-organized, sequential, and coherent composition of the *Jivasamas* on its subject, as its name suggests, it seems illogical to assume that its author compiled these verses from those aforementioned texts into his own work. Instead, it is more logical to say that the creator of the *Jivasamas* was indeed a knower of the 11 *angas* that are the limbs of *Shrutajnana* and the 14 *Purvas*. Even if he was not a *Shruta Kevali*, he had a profound knowledge of a large part of the *angas* and *Purvas*. This is why he was able to make his work so clear and detailed. There is no reason to believe that this work did not reach Dharasena Acharya through the Acharya tradition. Rather, as I mentioned in the introduction to the *Prakrit Panchasangrah*, it is more likely that, like the author of the *Prakrit Panchasangrah*, the *Jivasamas* was also memorized by Dharasena Acharya, and he explained it to both his disciples.

Here, it would not be irrelevant to give a brief introduction to the *Jivasamas*. In the first verse, the twenty-four *Jinavaras* (Tirthankaras) are saluted, and a promise is made to speak about the *Jivasamas*. In the second verse, it is said that the *Jivasamas* should be followed through the six *Anuyogadwaras* of *Nikesha*, *Nirukti*, (instructions, ownership, etc.) and the eight *Anuyogadwaras* of (truth, number, etc.) through the *Marganas* of motion, etc. The third verse lays down the rules for the *Prarupana* of four or many types of *Nikeshas*, including names. The fourth verse states that all *Bhavas* (substances) should be followed through the aforementioned six *Anuyogadwaras*. The fifth verse instructs on the eight *Anuyogadwaras* of truth, number, etc., which are as follows:

**Sant-pay-paruvana-ya davva-pamanam cha khitta-phusana ya | Kalantaram cha bhavo appa-bahu-am cha daraai || 5 ||**

## Introduction

[103]
Readers should compare this story with the first chapter of the Shatkhandagama, starting from the seventh sutra, "Santparuvana". Subsequently, the names of the fourteen Marganas are listed in the well-known verse starting with "Gai Indie Ya Kaie", which is exactly as mentioned in sutra number 4 of the Shatkhandagama. Further, in the seventh verse, by saying "Etto U Chaudasanh Ihanugaman Karissami", and listing the names of the fourteen Gunasthanas in two verses, an inspiration to know them in order is given. The description from the 5th to the 9th verse of Jivasamas is exactly the same as the 2nd to the 22nd sutra of Jivasthan, both in terms of words and meaning. To avoid unnecessary expansion, both are not being quoted here.

After this, the description of Satprarupana is given in 76 verses, exactly as it is in Jivasthan's Satprarupana. However, in Jivasamas, according to its name, all the necessary descriptions related to each Margana are available. For example, in the Gatimargna, the names of the various sub-categories of each Gati are given. Even in the description of Narakgati, the names of the seven Narakas and their seven corresponding Earths with their names and lineages are given. In the description of Manushygati, the names of Karmabhumij, Bhogbhumij, Antarvipaj, and the distinctions of Arya-Mlenchcha are given. Similarly, in the description of Devgati, the names of the four types of Devas and their respective heavens are listed. In the Indriyamargna, along with the guidance of Gunasthanas, the description of all six Paryaptis and their masters is also given. While this description is given under Yogamargna in Jivasthan.

In Kayamargna, besides the guidance of Gunasthanas, the names of the five types of stationary Kayikas, namely Prithvikayik, etc., are described in detail. The 14 verses starting with "Pudhavi Ya Sakkara Valuya" are the same as found in the Dhwala Pustak 1, page 272 onwards, and in Mulachar from the 206th verse onwards, and also in Uttaradhyayanas, Acharang Niyukti, Prakrit Panchasangrah, and some Go. Jivakand. Under this Margana, the description of Satchitta-Achitta, etc., Yonis and Kulkodi is given, along with the description of the size of Prithvikayik, etc., beings and the aggregation and organization of Traskayik beings, which is very useful from the perspective of information, considering the subject matter.

The description from Yogamargna to Aharamargna is the same as in the Jivasthan of the Shatkhandagama. The special thing in Jivasamas is that in Gyanamargna, the distinctions of Abhinibodhik Gyan, like Avgraha, etc., are described. In Samyammmarg, Pulak, Bakusha, etc., are described. In Leshyamargna, Dravyaleshya is described. And in Samyaktvamargna, the distinctions of Karma like Deshghati, Sarvaghati, etc., are described in relation to Kshayopshamic Samyaktva. Finally, by explaining the difference between Sakar and Anakar uses, and by saying "Savve Tallakkhana Jiwa", the nature of the Jiva is also explained.

##  **The Six-Part Canon**

Here, for the benefit of the readers, we are presenting a passage that highlights the similarities between the two texts.

**Jivasamas** -  **Asanni amanapanchindayant sanni u saman chhaumatta. No sanni no asanni kevalnaani u vinnea. || 81 ||**
**Jivasthanasanianuvadena aththi sanni asanni || 172 || Sanni micchaitthippahudi jav khain kasayaviyaraychadumatta tti || 173 || Asanni eindayappahudi jav asannipanchindaya tti || 174 ||**

Readers will themselves experience the similarity of these two passages and the subtlety of the Jivasamas' style of narration, as well as the special characteristic of the instruction of the Kevalis, "Neither Sanni nor Asanni."

- While describing the second form of numerical representation or the following of the substance-proof, the Jivasamas has explained the four divisions of the first proof, namely substance, field, time, and emotion. Subsequently, in the substance-proof, the divisions of Man, Unmana, etc. have been explained, in the field-proof, the divisions of Angul (Hasta), Dhanush, etc., in the time-proof, the divisions of Samaya, Avli, Ucchvas, etc., and in the emotion-proof, the divisions of direct and indirect knowledge. Among these, the field and time-proofs have been described in great detail, in 14 and 35 verses respectively. This has been written in its place by the Dhavalakar. The verses describing these four types of proofs are found in the texts of the Digambar and Svetambar sects, either exactly as they are or with slight variations in words, which proves that they have been passed down through the Acharya-Parampara. The description of these four types of proofs was common knowledge in front of the Shatkhandagamkar, therefore, he did not consider it appropriate to include it in his work.

After this, the number of Mithyadristi, etc. beings has been explained, which is exactly the same in both the texts. Here is a passage for the information of the readers:

**Jivasamas -  Gathamiccha davyamantan kalenossappini anantao. Khettena bhijjamana havanti loga ananta o || 144 ||**

**Shatkhandagam - Sutra _Oghena micchaitthi davvapamane na kevadiya? Ananta || 2 || Anantanantahi ossappiniussappinihi na avahiranti kalena || 3 || Khettena anantananta loga || 4 ||**

(Shatkhandagam, p. 54-55)

Page #118:
---------------------------
## Introduction
[105]
Readers will themselves experience the verbal and economic equality of the presentation of both subjects.
In this way, by stating the number of fourteen Gunasthanas in the Jivasamaas, and the number of three Marganas like motion, etc., and by giving directions about the Sântaramarganas, etc., it has been said:
"Whatever feelings are wherever they are in the five motions,
Those are the Anumargita Dravyapamana, O wise ones." || 166 ||
That is, I have described the Dravyapamana in these few Marganas, accordingly, the wise hero should himself know the Dravyapamana of the remaining possible Marganasthana in all five motions by Anumargana. It seems that keeping this indication in mind, the Shatkhandagamakar has described the Dravyapamana of the remaining 11 Marganas in a total of 90 sutras.

While describing the Kshetraprarupa, the Jivasamaas first explains in great detail the bodies of the beings in the four motions, which is very necessary considering the subject matter. Finally, the Kshetraprarupa of all the beings in all the Gunasthanas and Marganasthana has been done through three stanzas. See the similarity of the sutras of Shatkhandagama with the stanza describing the Kshetraprarupa in the Gunasthanas:

**Jivasamaas-Stanza**
"In all the beings, there are countless parts of the wrong, and the rest are there. Only in countless parts, parts, or in all the beings." || 178 ||

**Shatkhandagama-Sutra**
"In which field is there wrong by the flow? In all beings." || 2 ||
"In which field is there right conduct by the teachings, and the non-yogic Kevali? In countless parts of the beings." || 3 ||
"In which field is there yogic Kevali? In countless parts of the beings, or in countless parts of those parts, or in all beings." || 4 ||
(Shatkhandagama, p. 86-88)

-
While describing the Sparshanprarupa, the Jivasamaas first gives directions about the Svasthana, Samudghata, and Uppaadapada, and explains the difference between Kshetra and Sparshan. Then, by stating how much Dravya is present in how many Kshetras, it describes the shape of the Madhyaloka in the infinite space as a Supratisthitasansthana, and then describes the separate shapes of the three Lokas, stating their length and width. Again, by describing the arrangement and placement of the islands and oceans in the Madhyaloka, it describes the increase and decrease related to the Kshetra of the upper and lower Lokas. Again, by stating the seven types of Samudghata, it explains how many Samudghatas are present in each motion. After giving all this necessary information, the Gunasthanas and...

[106]
**Six-Part Canon**
The touching of the stages of the path has been exemplified. The touching of the stages of qualities has been described in one and a half verses in the *Jivasamas*, while in the *Six-Part Canon* it is described in 9 sutras. Compare the two.
*Jivasamas* - Verse: All beings, by the teachings of the *Sasan*, by the *Ajiva* teachings, are in the *Puththa* fourteen parts, twelve, eighteen, and six. [195]
*Six-Part Canon* - Sutra: By the *Micchaditthi*, what field is touched? All beings. [2] By the *Sasan* *Sammadittthi*, what field is touched? An innumerable part of beings. [3] Eight, twelve, and fourteen parts, or the *Desuna*. [4] By the *Samm* *Micchaditthi* and the *Asanjad* *Sammadittthi*, what field is touched? An innumerable part of beings. [5] Eight and fourteen parts, or the *Desuna*. [6] By the *Sanjad* and *Asanjad*, what field is touched? An innumerable part of beings. [7] Six and fourteen parts, or the *Desuna*. [8] By the *Pamattasanjad* and *Paddadi* beings, by the *Ajojik* *Kevali*, what field is touched? An innumerable part of beings. By the *Sajojik* *Kevali*, what field is touched? An innumerable part of beings, innumerable parts, or all beings. [10] (*Six-Part Canon*, pp. 101-104)
While exemplifying time, the *Jivasamas* first describes the four types of beings in detail, along with their state of existence and their physical state, because without knowing this, the time-exemplification of the stages of qualities and the stages of the path cannot be properly understood. Subsequently, the time-exemplification of the stages of qualities and the stages of the path is done in relation to various other beings. The exemplification of the stages of qualities is done in 7 verses in the *Jivasamas*, while in the *Six-Part Canon* it is done in 31 sutras. Due to the fear of expansion, both are not being quoted here. In the *Jivasamas*, after exemplifying the time-differences of some of the main stages of the path, it is said at the end:
Here, in the *Jivasamas*, the subtle and skillful, who are well-versed in the teachings, should, by being well-versed in the teachings, contemplate the subtle division of time of the unexpressed stages of the path and explain its difference to the student beings. [240]
While exemplifying the difference, the *Jivasamas* first explains the nature of the difference, then it is explained where the beings of the four types are born after death. Then, the time of the difference of the stages of qualities and the stages of the path, where the difference is possible, is explained. Afterwards...

**[107]**

The Gunasthanas have been differentiated by three stanzas, while they are described in the Shatkhandagama by 19 sutras. Subsequently, by differentiating some major Marganas, it has been said that the time division related to Bhav and Bhav-Parivartan should be followed sequentially by Anumargna. One should be attentive (Atisavdhan) with the Bhav and similarly follow the Antar-Anugam of the remaining Marganas. **[263]**

**Introduction**

This means that the time division related to Bhav and Bhav-Parivartan of the unmentioned Marganas should be followed sequentially by Anumargna. One should be attentive (Atisavdhan) with the Bhav and similarly follow the Antar-Anugam of the remaining Marganas.

The Bhav-Prarupna has been done in Jivasamaas by only six stanzas, while in the Jivasthan of Shatkhandagama it is described in 92 sutras. The special feature of the brevity of Jivasamaas is that it directs the Audayik etc. Bhavs in the Marganasthanas by each stanza.

**For example:**

Gai Kay Trey Lessya Kasay Annaan Ajay Asanni. Micchahare Udaya, Jiy Bhavyier Ttiy Sahavo. **[269]**

This means that Gati, Kay, Ved, Lessya, Agnan, Asanyam, Asanjni, Mithyatva and Ahar Marganas are Audayik Bhav-rupa. Jivattva, Bhavyattva and Ithar (Abhavyattva) are the three Sva-bhav-rupa, i.e., Parinamik Bhav-rupa.

The Prarupna of Alp-Bahutva in Jivasamaas has been done in a special way, which aligns the basis of Alp-Bahutva Prarupna of both the first part Jivattan and the second part Khudabandh of Shatkhandagama. The two stanzas given first in Jivasamaas regarding Alp-Bahutva Prarupna should be matched with the Alp-Bahutva of Khudabandh.

**Jivasamaas-Stanza:**

Thava Nara Narehi Ya Asankhgunia Havanti Neraiya. Tattho Sura Surehi Ya Siddha Ananta Tao Tiriya. **[271]**

Thowau Manussiyo Nar-Naray-Tirikhiyo Asankhguna. Sur-Devi Sankhguna Siddha Tiriya Anantguna. **[272]**

**Khudabandh-Sutra:**

Appa Bahugagamen Gadiyaanuvaaden Panch Gadiyo Samaasen. **[1]** Savvathowa Masa. **[2]** Raiya Asankhejjaguna. **[3]** Deva Asankhejjaguna. **[4]** Siddha Anantguna. **[5]**

(Khuddabandha, Alpbahutva, p. 451) It is quite clear from both the excerpts of both the texts that the description of the smallness of the Khuddabandha is based on the above two verses. Similarly, the basis of verses 16 to 21 in the Khuddabandha regarding the smallness of the Khuddabandha is the 275th verse of the Jivasamaas, verses 38 to 44 are based on the 276th verse.
After the description of the smallness of the Marganas in the Khuddabandha, the Mahadanḍaka of smallness, which has the description of smallness from verse 2 to verse 43, is based on verses 273 and 274 of the Jivasamaas.
The description of the smallness of the Gunasthanas within the Jivasthana, which is given from verse 2 to verse 26, is based on the 277th and 278th verses of the Jivasamaas. Again, the smallness of the Gatimargna in the Marganasthana is mentioned along with the Gunasthanas. The same verses are the basis for the smallness of the Indriya and Kayamargna, which we have discussed while comparing them with the verses of the Khuddabandha. Finally, to know the smallness of the remaining unmentioned Marganas, it is said in the 281st verse that
'Evam appabahuyam davvapamanehi saheja'. That is, in the same way, the smallness of all the remaining unmentioned Marganas should be proved on the basis of the Dravyapamana (numerical representation).
Concluding the Jivasamaas, it is completed by giving two verses at the end, stating the smallness of all the Dravyas in relation to the Dravya and the smallness in relation to the Pradeshas, which indicates the importance of the chapter called Jivasamaas. Those two verses are as follows:
1] Bahubhangaditthivaae diddvatthanam jinavarovaitthanam.
Dharanapatthatto pun jivasamaasattha uvajutto || 285 || 2] Evam jivaajive vittharamihie samaasanididhe.
Uvajutto jo gunae tassa mai jaaye viula || 286 || That is, the man who is fit to understand the meaning of the multi-faceted view of the Jinas, which is explained in this Jivasamaas, attains the understanding of the meaning of the view.

---------------------------
## Introduction

[109] In this treatise, which elaborates on the twelve-limbed scriptures and which I have summarized, whoever contemplates and reflects on its meaning, their intellect becomes vast.

## Conclusion

Seeing the composition of the Jivasamaas, its importance is etched upon the heart. There is no doubt that its creator was a foreknower, isn't there? Because they themselves have indicated their foreknowledge by using the term "Bahubhangditthiae" in the concluding verse mentioned above.

Upon reviewing the entire Jivasamaas, readers will arrive at two conclusions: firstly, it is a very important text in terms of the subtlety and importance of its subject matter; and secondly, it has been the foundation for the depiction of the Jivatthaana in the Shatkhandagama.

Although one thing about the Jivasamaas is definitely jarring, that it only mentions 12 heavens instead of 16 classes, and does not name the nine directions, yet just as in the Tattvarthasutra, where in the sutra "*Dashastapanchadwadashavikalpaah*", 12 kalpas are mentioned instead of 16, but by implying the Indras, and in the sutra "*Navasu Aveyakeshu Vijayadishu*", the names of the directions are not mentioned, but by understanding the implication from the word "*Navasu*", a solution has been found, similarly, a solution can be found here as well.

From page 572 to 577 of the Shatkhandagama, under the Vedanaakshetravidhaan of the Vedanakhand, from sutra 30 to 99 of the Avagaahana-Mahadandaka, the very little amount of Avagaahana of all beings is explained, the sutra-like seeds of which are indeed present in the field-like depiction of the Jivasamaas, however, the direct connection, as found in the "Suhumanivaate Aamoo" etc. (from verse 97 to 101) verses in the Go. Jeevakand, is not found elsewhere. The style of composition of these verses is exactly the same as that of the verses of the inferior and superior very little amount of Avagaahana, which have 64 pada, found in the Vedanakhand. Therefore, in the Go. Jeevakand, coming from the tradition of the previous teachers...

Many narratives are compiled in the <i>Chakkhandagam</i>, therefore it is very likely that these narratives are also collected there. And if they are authored by Nemichandracharya, then it must be said that he truly imitated the previous <i>Gatha Sutrakaras</i>.
The learned scholar, Pandit Sumatibaiji, has edited this <i>Aarya Granthraj</i> with great effort and it has turned out very beautiful. The entire <i>Shatkhandagam</i> being in one volume (one book) has made it easy for those who want to study and practice. This is the primary text of <i>Jinavani</i> and is therefore extremely important. I am grateful to Baiji for giving me the opportunity to write this preface.

Salutation to the Arihants, salutation to the Siddhas, salutation to the Aacharyas, salutation to the Upadhyayas, and salutation to all the virtuous beings in the world. || 1 ||

**Arihant** - Those who are destructive to the enemy-like delusion, or in other words, those who are destructive to the ignorance-veil and knowledge-veil, are called Arihants. It means those who have destroyed the four destructive karmas - ignorance-veil, knowledge-veil, delusion, and obstacles - and have attained the infinite fourfold (Anant Chatushtaya) are called Arihants.

**Siddh** - Those who have destroyed all eight karmas, including the ignorance-veil, and have achieved their desired goal, becoming accomplished, are called Siddhas. After the destruction of these eight karmas, the following eight qualities naturally manifest in the Siddhas: perfect knowledge, perfect vision, unimpededness, rightness, penetration, subtlety, lightness, and infinite power.

**Aacharya** - Those who themselves practice the five types of conduct - vision, knowledge, conduct, austerity, and power - and also guide and teach other virtuous beings to do the same, are called Aacharyas. They are also knowledgeable in the scriptures, having mastered the fourteen, ten, or nine previous periods, and are proficient in both their own time and the time of others.

**Upadhyaya** - Those who teach the twelve-fold scripture (Dwadashang) or explain the contemporary sermons are called Upadhyayas.

## Chapter 2: The Fourteen Stages of the Soul

**[1, 1, 2]** A **Sadhu** is one who is always dedicated to attaining liberation through the three jewels and who holds equality towards all beings.  

It is a tradition to begin a text with a statement of six things: auspiciousness, reason for writing, purpose, proof, name, and author.  Following this tradition, Acharya Pushpadanta has composed this auspicious verse, known as the **Mangal Sutra**.  This **Mangal Sutra** is also known as the **Namo-kar Mantra**.  "Mangal" means that which removes the impurities of sin.  There are two types of impurities: **dravya-mala** (material impurities) and **bhava-mala** (mental impurities).  **Dravya-mala** is further divided into two types: external and internal.  External **dravya-mala** includes sweat, dust, and excrement.  Internal **dravya-mala** refers to the eight types of karma, such as **jnana-avaran** (veil of knowledge), which are associated with the soul in its dense form and are divided into **prakriti** (nature), **sthiti** (state), **anubhag** (experience), and **pradesh** (region).  **Bhava-mala** refers to the consequences of ignorance and non-perception.  Alternatively, the word "Mang" can also mean virtue or happiness.  Therefore, according to the etymology, "Mangal" is that which brings happiness.

Now, to investigate the fourteen **guna-sthana** (stages of virtue), we first need to understand the fourteen **margana** (paths of investigation).

**Therefore, these fourteen stages of the soul, which are the paths of investigation, are worthy of knowing.**

**[2]**  These fourteen stages of the soul, which are the paths of investigation, are worthy of knowing because they are useful in understanding the fourteen **guna-sthana** (stages of virtue).

**[3]**  The word "**jiva-samasa**" means that which summarizes the infinite souls.  Therefore, the fourteen **guna-sthana** are included in the term "**jiva-samasa**".  **Margana**, **gaveshana**, and **anveshana** are synonyms.  The **margana-sthana** are those through which the fourteen **guna-sthana** are investigated, along with the eight **anuyoga-dvara** (gates of knowledge).

**[4]**  These are the fourteen **margana**: **Gati** (motion), **Indriya** (senses), **Kaya** (body), **Yoga** (practice), **Veda** (knowledge), **Kasaya** (passions), **Jnana** (wisdom), **Samyama** (self-control), **Darsana** (vision), **Leshya** (subtle body), **Bhavya-tva** (potential for liberation), **Samyak-tva** (right conduct), **Sanjni** (consciousness), and **Ahar** (food).

**[5]**  **Gati** is that which is attained.  Alternatively, it is the movement from one existence to another.  Or, it is the state of the soul that arises from the **karma** called **gati-nama**.

Page #128:
---------------------------
[1, 1, 4] The form of the path to liberation of the soul.
[3] There are three types of motion. Generally, there are four types of motion: Deva-gati (motion of the gods), Manushya-gati (motion of humans), Tiryanch-gati (motion of animals), and Naraka-gati (motion of hell).
[2] Indriya - Since the senses like touch, etc., are capable of grasping their respective objects on their own, like Indra, they are called Indriya. Or, the meaning of Indra is the soul, and the signs or marks of that soul are called Indriyas.
[3] Kaya - The accumulated result of the karmas called earth, etc., is called Kaya. Or, one should understand the Kaya as the mass of pudgala, in the form of generosity, etc., obtained by the soul in the form of yoga. That Kaya is of six types, due to the difference of earth, etc. Those six Kayas, earth, etc., are included in the two categories of Trasakaya and Sthavarakaya.
[4] Yoga - The power of the living being, combined with mind, speech, and body, by which karma comes, according to the rise of the karma called body, is called Yoga.
[5] Veda - The feeling of different states (female state, male state, neuter state) by the living being due to the rise of karma is called Veda.
[6] Kashaya - Those who plow the field of karma, which produces various types of grains like happiness and sorrow, etc., are called Kashaya.
[7] Jnana - That by which the living being knows all the substances, their qualities, and various types of Paryayas, directly or indirectly, is called Jnana.
[8] Samyama - Holding the vows of non-violence, etc., observing the rules of conduct like walking, speaking, etc., conquering the Kashayas like anger, etc., abandoning the punishments of evil deeds, and suppressing the five senses; this is called Samyama. The meaning is that the withdrawal from the objects to be abandoned and the inclination towards the objects to be accepted is called Samyama.
[9] Darshan - The perception of the self, which is general and specific, is called Darshan. In the scriptures, inward-directed mind-light is considered Darshan and outward-directed mind-light is considered Jnana. The meaning is that the effort that is the cause of the origin of Jnana, the perception of the transformed soul in that form is called Darshan, and the subsequent perception of external objects in the form of imagination is to be understood as Jnana. This is also the difference between the two.
[10] Leshya - That by which the living being attaches itself to virtue and vice is called Leshya. This is the etymological meaning of the word Leshya. The meaning is that the inclination of Yogas, influenced by Kashayas, is called Leshya.

## The Six Realms and the Nature of Living Beings

**Chapter 1, Section 1, Verse 511**

**1. Bhavyas:** Those beings who are capable of attaining liberation in the future, or who possess the qualities necessary for it, are called Bhavyas.

**2. Abhavyas:** Those beings who cannot attain liberation at any time, or who lack the necessary qualities, are called Abhavyas.

**3. Samyaktvam:** The belief in the six substances, five aggregates, and nine categories of reality as taught by the Jina, through understanding and acceptance, is called Samyaktvam.

**4. Sanjnis:** Those beings who can receive instruction, perform actions, give teachings, and engage in discourse through the mind are called Sanjnis. Those who cannot receive such instruction, etc., are called Asanjnis. According to the etymology, "Sanjnam" means "mind." Those beings who possess this mind are called Sanjnis, and those who lack it are called Asanjnis.

**5. Aharakas:** Those beings who consume the three bodies (Audarik, Vaikriyik, and Aharak) and the six categories of matter (Pudgalavarganas) are called Aharakas. Those who do not consume such food are called Anaharakas. The four types of beings who have attained the state of liberation (Vigrahgati), the liberated beings who have attained the state of Pratar and Lokapurana, the Sayogakevali, Ayogakevali, and Siddha Bhagavan are Anaharakas. All other beings should be considered Aharakas.

**Now, to describe the methods of exploring these categories of living beings (Gunasthanas), the following sutra is stated:**

**Verse 5:**

"These fourteen categories of living beings are described through these eight methods of exploration."

**Verse 6:**

"These eight methods of exploration are as follows:"

**Verse 7:**

"Satprरूपणा, Dravyapramananugam, Kshetranugam, Phosananugam, Kalānugam, Antarānugam, Bhavanugam, and Alpbahutvanugam are the eight methods of exploration."

**1. Satprरूपणा:** The method of exploration that establishes the existence of beings in terms of their origin, destruction, and permanent nature is called Satprरूपणा.

**2. Dravyapramananugam:** The method of exploration that establishes the characteristics of those beings whose existence has been established through Satprरूपणा is called Dravyapramananugam.

**3. Kshetranugam:** The method of exploration that establishes the location of those beings whose existence and characteristics have been established through Satprरूपणा and Dravyapramananugam is called Kshetranugam.

[1, 1, 10] Santparoovanaae Oghaniddesso
[5 This Anuyogadvaar describes their present understanding. (4) Sparshanuyogam - It describes their past specific touch. (5) Kaalanuyogam - The Anuyogadvaar that describes the inferior and superior states of the said substances is called Kaalanuyogam. (6) Antaranuyogam - The Anuyogadvaar that describes the inner time of those substances whose existence etc. is already known is called Antaranuyogam. (7) Bhavanuyogam - The Anuyogadvaar that describes the feelings of the said substances is called Bhavanuyogam. (8) Alpbahutvaanuyogam - The Alpbahutvaanuyogam describes the inferiority and superiority of those substances in relation to each other.
Now, to describe the nature of Satpraroopan, the sutra says..... Santparoovanadaae duviho niddesso oghean aadesena ya ||8|| There are two types of instructions in Satpraroopan, one with respect to Ogh and the other with respect to Aadesh. ||8||
The word nirdess means description or explanation. Ogh refers to the general and Aadesh refers to the specific. While interpreting the sutra, the previous sutra's 'chouddasanham jeevasamaasanam' should be continued. Therefore, it means that the nature of the fourteen Jeevasamaas is described in two ways, Ogh and Aadesh. Jeevas who live well in the feelings of Audaayik etc. are called Jeevasamaas. These feelings of Audaayik etc. are as follows: the feeling that arises from the suppression of karma is called Aupashmik feeling. The feeling that arises from the destruction of karma is called Kshayik feeling. The feeling that arises from the destruction and suppression of karma is called Kshayopaashmik feeling. The meaning is that the feeling that arises from the rise and fall of the desired Karmapratik's Sarvaghaati competitors, its permanent state of suppression, and the rise of the Deshaghaati competitors is called Kshayopaashmik feeling. The feeling that arises from the Jeeva's nature alone, without any relation to the rise, suppression, destruction, and Kshayopaashmik of karma, is called Pariinaamik feeling.
Now, to describe Ogh, i.e., Gunasthanpraroopan, the next sutra says Oghena aththi micchaitti ||9|| There are Mithyadrishti Jeevas in general. ||9||
Mithya, Vitath, Alik, and Asaty are synonymous. The word Drishti means vision or faith. This means that the Jeevas whose vision is Mithya, which arises from the rise of the Mithyatva karma in the form of opposite, solitary, humility, doubt, and ignorance, are called Mithyadrishti Jeevas.
Now, to describe the second Gunasthan, the next sutra says - Saasanasammaiitti ||10|| There are Saasadan Samyagdristi Jeevas in general. ||10||

## The Sixfold Division of the Universe and the State of the Soul

**Chapter 1, Chapter 1, Verse 11**

The **Sāsādan** is a state of the soul where the **Samyaktvakī** (right faith) is weakened, but the soul has not yet experienced the consequences of **Mithyātvakarma** (false belief karma). This means that the soul has lost its **Samyakdarshana** (right vision) due to the arising of one of the four **Anantānubandhī** (infinitely binding) karmas, but has not yet experienced the **Mithyātvārūpa** (false belief) consequences that arise from the **Mithyātvakarma**.

**Verse 11**

**Sammāmichchāitthī** || 11 ||  This means that there are souls who have both **Samyak** (right) and **Mithyā** (false) vision. || 11 ||

**Explanation:**

**Dṛṣṭi** (vision), **Śraddhā** (faith), **Ruchi** (taste), and **Pratyay** (conviction) are synonyms. A soul that has both right and false vision is called **Samyagmithyādrṣṭi**. Just as when yogurt and jaggery are mixed, their individual tastes cannot be distinguished, but their combined taste becomes a different entity, similarly, the combined consequences of **Samyaktv** (right faith) and **Mithyātv** (false belief) are called **Miśra Guṇasthāna** (mixed state).

The **Mithyātvaprakṛti** (false belief nature) destroys **Samyaktv** completely, but the **Samyagmithyātvaprakṛti** (mixed nature) does not destroy **Samyaktv** completely. In this state, the **Mithyātvaprakṛti** has **Sarvaghatī** (all-destroying) opponents that arise and cease, and their **Sadavasthārūpa** (permanent) suppression, along with the **Samyagmithyātvaprakṛti** having **Sarvaghatī** opponents that continue to arise, leads to a state of **Kṣayopashamika** (destruction and suppression).

Alternatively, the **Samyaktvaprakṛti** has **Deśaghatī** (country-destroying) opponents that arise and cease, and their **Sadavasthārūpa** (permanent) suppression, along with the **Mithyātvaprakṛti** having **Sarvaghatī** opponents that continue to arise, leads to a state of **Kṣayopashamika** (destruction and suppression).

**Verse 12**

**Asanjadassammāitthī** || 12 || This means that there are souls who have **Asanyata Samyakdṛṣṭi** (unrestrained right vision). || 12 ||

**Explanation:**

A soul with right vision is called **Samyakdṛṣṭi**, and an unrestrained **Samyakdṛṣṭi** is called **Asanyata Samyakdṛṣṭi**. There are three types of **Samyakdṛṣṭi** souls: **Kṣayika Samyakdṛṣṭi** (destruction-bound right vision), **Vedaka Samyakdṛṣṭi** (knowledge-bound right vision), and **Aupaśamika Samyakdṛṣṭi** (suppression-bound right vision).

A soul becomes **Kṣayika Samyakdṛṣṭi** when all seven natures, including the four **Anantānubandhī** karmas, **Mithyātv** (false belief), **Samyagmithyātv** (mixed belief), and **Samyaktv** (right belief), are completely destroyed. The soul becomes **Aupaśamika Samyakdṛṣṭi** when these seven natures are suppressed, and becomes **Vedaka Samyakdṛṣṭi** when the **Samyaktvaprakṛti** (right belief nature) arises.

This **Vedaka Samyakdṛṣṭi** is also called **Kṣayopashamika Samyakdṛṣṭi** because it arises from the arising and ceasing of **Samyaktv** (right belief), **Mithyātv** (false belief), and **Samyagmithyātv** (mixed belief), and their **Sadavasthārūpa** (permanent) suppression, along with the **Samyaktvaprakṛti** having **Deśaghatī** (country-destroying) opponents that continue to arise.

**Kṣayika Samyakdṛṣṭi** souls never experience **Mithyātv** (false belief). However, **Aupaśamika Samyakdṛṣṭi** souls can experience **Mithyātv** (false belief) due to the consequences of their actions, and they can lose their **Aupaśamika Samyaktv** (suppression-bound right belief). They can also become **Sāsādan**...

[1, 1, 14]
The state of being in the flow of the path of the saints, Samyagdristi, sometimes becomes Samyagmithyadristi and sometimes Vedakasamyagdristi. Vedakasamyagdristi is one who has weak faith. Just as an old man holds a stick loosely in his hand, so too is he weak in his faith in the truth. In this Gunasthan, there is Kshayik, Aupashmik, and Kshayopaashmik, depending on whether it is Kshayik Samyaktva, Aupashmik Samyaktva, or Vedakasamyaktva.
_ The epithet "Asanyata" given for Samyagdristi in the Sutra is an Antadipak. Therefore, it describes the Asanyata of all three Gunasthanas below it. And the word "Samyagdristi" in this Sutra is applicable to all the Gunasthanas above, like the flow of the Ganges River.
Now, to describe the Gunasthan of Deshaviрата, the next Sutra says: Sanjadasajda || 13 || There are beings who are generally both Sanjata and Asanjata || 13 ||
In the fifth Gunasthan, there is no contradiction in accepting both Sanjama and Asanjama in a being, because the causes of their origin are different. The cause of the origin of his Sanjama is the absence of desire for violence, and the cause of the origin of his Asanjama is the absence of aversion to violence against stationary beings. Therefore, this becomes the fifth Gunasthan called Sanjatasanjata. Sanjamaasanjama is Kshayopaashmik, because it is caused by the absence of the rise of the all-destroying competitors of the Pratyakhyanavarania Kshaya in the present time, and the suppression of the same in the future, and the rise of the Pratyakhyanavarania Kshaya.
Now, to describe the first Gunasthan of the Sanjatas, the next Sutra says: Pamattasanjada || 14 || There are beings who are generally Pamattasanjata || 14 ||
Those who are intoxicated with pride are called Pamattas. That is, beings who are with Pramada are called Pamattas, and those who have attained Viraati or Sanjama well are called Sanjatas. The meaning is that those who are Sanjatas even while being with Pramada are called Pamattasanjatas. In the sixth Gunasthan, there is no lack of Sanjama even while Pramada is present. Here, the word "Pamatt" is an Antadipak. Therefore, one should understand that Pramada is present in all the Gunasthanas before this. In this Gunasthan, there is Kshayopaashmik, depending on Sanjama. The reason is that it is caused by the destruction of the rise of the all-destroying competitors of Pratyakhyanavaran in the present time, and the suppression of the same in the future, and the rise of the Sanjwalana Kshaya.

## 8] The Abode of Souls in the Sixfold Scripture

[1, 1, 15] In the Gunasthana, there are also Kshayika, Kshayopaśamika, and Aupaśamika states. The inattentiveness in the observance of conduct due to the intense arising of Sanjvalana and Nokashaya is called Pramada. It is of fifteen types due to the four Vikathas: Strikatha, Bhaktakatha, Rashtrakatha, and Avanipalakatha; the four Kashayas: Krodha, Mana, Maya, and Lobha; the five Indriyas: Sparśana, Rasana, Prāṇa, Chakshu, and Śrotra; and the two: Nidra and Pranaya.

Further, to describe the Gunasthana characterized by pure Samyama in the Kshayopaśamika Samyamas, the Uttar Sutra says:

**Apamattasanjada || 15 ||**
**Generally, there are Apramattasanyata souls. || 15 ||**

Those whose Samyama is free from the aforementioned fifteen types of Pramada are called Apramattasanyata. In this Gunasthana, the Kshayopaśamika state is present in relation to Samyama. This is because, in the present time, the arising and cessation of the Pratyakhyanavaraṇiya Karma, which is the most destructive of all the competitors, and the cessation of their arising in the future, and the mild arising of the Sancalana Karma, give rise to that Samyama. In relation to Samyaktva, there are also Kshayika, Kshayopaśamika, and Aupaśamika states.

Now, to describe the first Gunasthana among those that subdue or destroy Charitramohaniya, the Uttar Sutra says:

**Apūvva-karaṇa-praviṭṭha-śuddhi-sanjade-su atthi uvasama khava || 16 ||**
**Generally, there are both Upaśamaka and Kshapaka souls who have entered the state of purity through the never-before-obtained karmas. || 16 ||**

The word "karaṇa" means "result." Those results that have never been obtained before, i.e., before this Gunasthana, are called Apūvva-karaṇa. This means that, excluding the souls of the present time who are the subject of discussion, the results that have not been obtained by the souls of other times, from the first time to every time, increasing in number, are called Apūvva. Those who have obtained these Apūvva results are called Apūvva-karaṇa-praviṭṭha-śuddhi-sanjata. Among them, those who are engaged in subduing the Charitramohaniya Karma are called Upaśamaka, and those who are engaged in destroying it are called Kshapaka.

All the Kshapaka and Upaśamaka souls who have obtained Apūvva-karaṇa have a similarity in their results in terms of their never-before-obtained nature. In this Gunasthana, the Kshayika state is found in the Kshapaka souls, and the Aupaśamika state is found in the Upaśamaka souls. However, in relation to Samyagdarshana, the Kshayika state is found in the Kshapaka, and the Aupaśamika and Kshayika states are found in the Upaśamaka. The reason for this is that the soul who has destroyed Darshanamoha...

---------------------------
[1, 1, 18.]
The one who has not destroyed the karmas is not on the path of destruction, and the one who has not subdued them is not on the path of subduing.
Now, to explain the final stage of the Gunasthana for those with coarse karmas, the sutra says:
Aṇiyatṭi-bādar-sāmparāiya-paviṭṭha-sudhisanjadēsu asthi uvasamā khava || 17 ||
In those who are generally free from karmas, coarse, karmic, and have entered into purity, there are both those who subdue and those who destroy. || 17 ||
The uninterrupted flow of the results of the karmas of those who are simultaneously present is called anivṛtti. Or, the word nivṛtti also means cessation. Therefore, those results which do not cease, i.e., do not change into a different form, are called anivṛttikaraṇa. In this Gunasthana, the results of those who are present at different times are completely different, and the results of those who are present at the same time are completely similar. The meaning is that in the time of anivṛttikaraṇa, which is only a moment, many beings who are present at the same time, just as they are different from each other in their external form, such as the size, shape, and color of their bodies, and in their internal form, such as their knowledge and use, they do not become different from each other through their results. They only have results that increase in infinite purity from one moment to the next.
The word 'bādar' used in the sutra should be understood as meaning that all the previous Gunasthana are bādar (coarse) and have karmas. The word sāmparāya means karma, and the word sthūla means bādar. This means that those beings who are restrained and whose purity has entered into coarse karmic results are called anivṛtti-bādar-sāmparāya-praviṣṭa-śuddhi-sanjata.
There are both those who subdue and those who destroy among such restrained beings. Now, to explain the final stage of the Gunasthana for the monks of the Kuśīla jati, the next sutra says:
Suhumasāmparāiya-paviṭṭha-sudhisanjadēsu asthi uvasamā khava || 18 ||
Generally, in those who are restrained, have entered into subtle karmas, and have attained purity, there are both those who subdue and those who destroy. || 18 ||
The word sāmparāya means karma, and subtle karma is called suhumasāmparāya. Those restrained beings whose purity has entered into subtle karmas are called suhumasāmparāya-praviṣṭa-śuddhi-sanjata. There are both those who subdue and those who destroy among them. Here, there are both karmic and subduing emotions, as opposed to those who are attached to the conduct. As opposed to right faith, those who destroy are attached to karmic emotions, and those who subdue are attached to both subduing and karmic emotions, because both can ascend to the path of subduing through right conduct.

##  Translation:

**[10]**

The Uttar Sutra says to explain the final Gunasthan in the Upasham श्रेणी of the Jiva:

**Uvasant-Kasay-Viyrag-Chhadumattha. || 19 ||**

**General meaning:**  Jivas who are Uvasant-Kasay-Viyrag-Chhadmasth. || 19 ||

Those whose Kashayas have subsided are called Uvasant-Kasay. Those whose Rag has been destroyed are called Viyrag. Chhadma refers to Jnana-Avaran and Darshan-Avaran, and those who reside in them are called Chhadmasth. Those who are Viyrag but still Chhadmasth are called Viyrag-Chhadmasth. The Viyrag qualifier here should be understood to negate the Sarg-Chhadmasth of the first ten Gunasthanas. Those who are Uvasant-Kasay and also Viyrag-Chhadmasth are called Uvasant-Kasay-Viyrag-Chhadmasth. This Uvasant-Kasay qualifier should be understood to negate the higher Gunasthanas. In this Gunasthan, all Kashayas are completely subsided, therefore, there is only an Aupashamik state with respect to Charitra. And with respect to Samyag Darshan, there are both Aupashamik and Kshayik states as before. Just as when a clear fruit is dropped into muddy water during the rainy season, the mud settles down and the water becomes clear, similarly, the clarity that arises from the subsidence of all Mohaniya Karmas should be understood as the Uvasant-Kasay Gunasthan.

Now, to explain the Nirgranth Gunasthan, the Uttar Sutra says:

**Khin-Kasay-Viyrag-Chhadumattha. || 20 ||**

**General meaning:**  Khin-Kasay-Viyrag-Chhadmasth Jivas. || 20 ||

Those whose Kashayas have become Khin (diminished) are called Khin-Kasay. Those who are Khin-Kasay and also Viyrag are called Khin-Kasay-Viyrag. Those who are Khin-Kasay-Viyrag and also Chhadmasth are called Khin-Kasay-Viyrag-Chhadmasth. The Chhadmasth word in this Sutra is Antadipak (illuminating the end). Therefore, it should be understood as indicating the Chhadmasth state of all the previous Gunasthanas. Here, since both types of Mohaniya Karmas are completely destroyed, therefore, in this Gunasthan, there is only a Kshayik state with respect to both Charitra and Samyag Darshan.

**[1, 1, 19]**

Those who have completely destroyed Mohaniya Karmas in the form of Prakriti, Sthiti, Anubhag, and Pradesh Bandh, and whose Antahkaran has become as clear as water kept in a crystal vessel, such Viyrag Nirgranth Sadhus should be understood as residing in the Khin-Kasay Gunasthan.

Now, to explain the Gunasthan of the Snatakas, the Uttar Sutra says:

**Sajog-Kevali. || 21 ||**

**General meaning:**  Sajog-Kevali Jivas. || 21 ||

[12] In the six realms, the living beings are:
[1, 1, 24] ... according to the Aadesha (special instruction) and the Gadiyaanuvaada (interpretation), there are Narakagati (hell realm), Tiriyachgati (animal realm), Manusshagati (human realm), Devagati (heavenly realm), and Siddhagati (liberated realm). || 24 ||

The interpretation of the path of motion according to the Aadesha (special instruction) is called Gadiyaanuvaada. According to the Gadiyaanuvaada, there are Narakagati (hell realm) and other realms. Those who are engaged in the inferior actions of violence, etc., are called Nirata (degraded) and their realm is called Niratagati (degraded realm). Alternatively, the one who causes harm or suffering to Nar (living beings) is called Narak (hell). Narak is a karma. The living beings who are born due to its manifestation are called Narak (hell beings) and their realm is called Narakgati (hell realm). Alternatively, the realm whose manifestation is the contributing cause of the manifestation of all inauspicious karmas is called Narakgati (hell realm).

The realm that causes birth in all species of animals is called Tiriyachgati (animal realm). Alternatively, those who are Tiryach (curved) or crooked in their nature are called Tiriyach and their realm is called Tiriyachgati (animal realm). The meaning is that those who are crooked in their mind, speech, and body; whose senses of food, etc., are well-developed; who are ignorant and inferior; and who have a large amount of sin, are called Tiriyach.

The realm that causes birth in all the states of human beings is called Manusshagati (human realm). Alternatively, those who are skillful in their mind, i.e., who can contemplate the merits and demerits, are called Manussha (human beings) and their realm is called Manusshagati (human realm). Alternatively, those who are the offspring of Manu are called Manussha (human beings) and their realm is called Manusshagati (human realm).

Those who play with the power of the eight Siddhis (supernatural powers) like Anima (becoming small), Mahima (becoming large), etc., are called Dev (heavenly beings) and their realm is called Devagati (heavenly realm).

Those who are free from birth, old age, death, fear, association, separation, sorrow, senses of food, etc., and diseases, etc., are called Siddha (liberated beings) and their realm is called Siddhagati (liberated realm).

Now, to investigate the aggregates of living beings in this realm, we say the following sutra:

Neraiya Chautthaanesu Aththi Micchaaiththi Saasanasammaaiththi Sammamicchaaiththi Asanjadasammaaiththi Tti || 25 ||

The Naraki (hell beings) are in the four Gunasthanas (states of being): Mithyaadrishti (false belief), Saasanasamyaadrishti (belief in the teachings), Samyagmithyaadrishti (mixed belief), and Asanjadasamyaadrishti (uncontrolled right belief). || 25 ||

In Narakgati (hell realm), there is opposition to the Saasanadan Gunasthan (state of belief in the teachings) along with the Aparyapt (inadequate) state. The Samyagmithyaatva Gunasthan (state of mixed belief) is opposed to the Aparyapt (inadequate) state everywhere. But, there is opposition to these along with the Paryapt (adequate) state...

## 1.1.27] Santparoovanae Gadimaggana

[13 is not, because, the perfect visionaries are found in harmony in all seven earths in the sufficient state. Since the bound-lifespan perfect visionary beings are born in the first earth after death, therefore, there is no contradiction of perfect vision with the insufficient state of the first earth. But no perfect visionary being is born in the second and other earths after death in any state. Therefore, there is a contradiction of the said perfect vision with the insufficient state of the second and other earths. In the hellish realm, there is no possibility of the above-mentioned qualities beyond these four qualities, because, there is a contradiction of birth in the hellish realm with restraint, non-restraint, and the alternative of restraint.

Now, to investigate the qualities in the animal realm, the next sutra says:

Tirkha panchasu haanesu aththi micchaitti saasan sammaitthi sammamicchaitti asanjad sammaitthi sanjdasajda tti || 26 ||

Animal beings are in these five qualities: wrong vision, saasadan perfect vision, perfect wrong vision, unrestrained perfect vision, and restrained unrestrained. || 26 ||

It is possible for the bound-lifespan unrestrained perfect vision and saasadan quality holders to be in harmony in the insufficient time of the animal realm. But it is not possible for the perfect wrong vision and restrained unrestrained to be in harmony in the insufficient time of the animal realm, because, there is a contradiction of perfect wrong vision and restrained unrestrained with the insufficient time in the animal realm. Among the five types of animals: ordinary animal, five-sense animal, five-sense sufficient animal, five-sense sufficient animal, and five-sense insufficient animal; the said five qualities are not found in the insufficient five-sense animals, because, there is only one quality of wrong vision for the attainable sufficient ones. In the animal females, only those with the two qualities of wrong vision and saasadan perfect vision are found in the insufficient time, the remaining three qualities are not found. Since the perfect visionaries are not born in the animal females, therefore, the fourth quality is not found in their insufficient time. The reason is that there is a rule that the perfect visionary being is not born in the six earths below the first earth, in the astrologers, the Vyantaras and the Bhavanavasis, and in all types of women.

Now, to decide the qualities in the human realm, the next sutra says:

Manussa chodassu gunatthaanesu asthi micchaitti saasan sammaitthi mamm amicchaitti asanjad sammaitthi sanjdasajda pamattamangada apamattamangada apuvakaran pavitth suddhisangadesu aththi uvasama khava aniyattit-badarasamparaiy-pavitth-sudhisangadesu asthi uvasama khava suhumasamparaiy-pavitth-mangadesu aththi uvasama khava uvasantakamay-viyaraychadumaththa khinakasay-viyaraychadumaththa sajogikevali ajogikevali tti || 27 ||

Humans are in these fourteen qualities: wrong vision, saasadan perfect vision, perfect wrong vision, unrestrained perfect vision, restrained unrestrained, heedful restrained, heedless restrained, uncreated-entered-pure-restrained, in which there are cessation and destruction, non-return-badara-entered-pure-restrained, in which there are cessation and destruction, subtle-entered-restrained, in which there are cessation and destruction, cessation-desire-covered-head, destroyed-desire-covered-head, connected-liberated, unconnected-liberated. || 27 ||

Page #139:
---------------------------
In the six realms, the living beings are found in fourteen stages of development:

[1, 1, 27.
In the subtle and gross saṃpārāya-praviṣṭa-śuddhi-saṃyata, there are the stages of upaśamaka and kṣapaka. In the subtle saṃpārāya-praviṣṭa-śuddhi-saṃyata, there are the stages of upaśamaka and kṣapaka. In the upaśānta-kaṣāya-vītarāga-chhadmastha, kṣīṇa-kaṣāya-vītarāga-chhadmastha, sayogika-kevali and ayogika-kevali, these fourteen stages are found. || 27 ||
Now, to investigate the stages of development in the realm of gods, the following sūtra is said:
14]
Deva ca su dvāsu atthi micchāiṭṭi sāsaṇasammāiṭṭhi sammāmicchāiṭṭhi asanjadassammāiṭṭhiti || 28 ||
Gods are found in four stages of development: mithyā-dṛṣṭi, sāsa-dāna-samyag-dṛṣṭi, samyag-mithyā-dṛṣṭi and asan-yata-samyag-dṛṣṭi. || 28 ||
Now, to explain the meaning of the previous sūtras in detail, four sūtras are said:
Trikṣā suddha aiṃdiyapphuḍi jāva asanipañcidia tti. || 29 ||
From the one-sense being to the non-conscious five-sense being, there are pure tiryanchas. || 29 ||
Those who have one sense of touch are called one-sense beings. Those who are non-conscious and have five senses are called non-conscious five-sense beings. The five types of one-sense beings, the three types of विकलेन्द्रिय, and the non-conscious five-sense beings, these living beings are found only in the realm of tiryanchas. This is the meaning of the word "śuddha" used in the sūtra.
Thus, after explaining the pure tiryanchas, the following sūtra is said to explain the mixed tiryanchas:
Trikṣā missa saṇimicchāiṭṭhipphuḍi jāva sanjadāsanjadā ti. || 30 ||
From the five-sense being with mithyā-dṛṣṭi to the saṃyata-asan-yata stage of development, there are mixed tiryanchas. || 30 ||
The tiryanchas have similarities with the living beings in the other three realms in terms of their mithyā-dṛṣṭi, sāsa-dāna-samyag-dṛṣṭi, samyag-mithyā-dṛṣṭi and asan-yata-samyag-dṛṣṭi stages of development. Therefore, the tiryancha living beings are called mixed with the living beings of the other three realms up to the fourth stage of development. Further, in terms of the saṃyama-asan-yata qualities, the tiryanchas have similarities only with the humans. Therefore, the tiryanchas up to the fifth stage of development are called mixed with the humans.
Now, to explain the similarities and differences in the stages of development of humans, the following sūtra is said:

Maṇussa missa micchāiṭṭhipphuḍiṃ jāva sanjadāsanjadā ti. || 31 ||
Humans are mixed from the mithyā-dṛṣṭi stage of development to the saṃyata-asan-yata stage of development. || 31 ||

Page #140:

## 1, 1, 33. ]
Santparuvanaaye Indiumanggana
[15

From the first to the fourth Gunasthanas, all humans are similar to the beings of the remaining three gatis in comparison to those four Gunasthanas, and in comparison to the Gunasthanas of Samyama and Asamyama, they are similar to the Tiryanchas. Therefore, humans up to the fifth Gunasthanas are called mixed.

Now, to explain the pure humans, the next sutra says:
Teṇ parāṁ suddhaā maṇuṣṣā || 32 ||
Beyond the fifth Gunasthanas, there are only pure humans. || 32 ||

Leaving the first five Gunasthanas, the remaining Gunasthanas are not found in any other gati except the human gati, therefore, those humans residing in the remaining Gunasthanas are called pure humans. Now, to investigate the Gunasthanas in Indriyamargna, the next sutra says:
Indiyaaṇuvaadeṇ atthi eindaia biindaia tiindaia cadurindaia pancindaia aṇidia ceti || 33 ||
According to the translation of Indriyamargna, there are Ekendriya, Dwiendriya, Triendriya, Chaturendriya, Panchendriya, and Anindriya beings. || 33 ||

Indan means being powerful, so here the word Indra refers to the soul. The sign (symbol) of that Indra is called Indriya. Or, what is created by the name karma is called Indriya. It is of two types: Dravyendriya and Bhaavendriya. Among these, Dravyendriya is also of two types: Nirvritti and Upakaran. What is created by karma is called Nirvritti. It is of two types: Baahya Nirvritti and Abhyantara Nirvritti. Among them, the creation of pure soul regions, the size of which is equal to the Lokapraman or the countless parts of the Utsavangula, which are transformed into the shape of the fixed eye, etc., is called Abhyantara Nirvritti. The meaning is that the Abhyantara Nirvritti of the touch Indriya is manifested in the soul regions of the size of Lokapraman, and the Abhyantara Nirvritti of the other four Indriyas is manifested in the regions of the size of countless parts of the Utsavangula. The group of pudgalas that is associated with the fixed shape and bears the name 'Indriya' in those soul regions is called Baahya Nirvritti. Among the said Indriyas, the shape of the Shrotra Indriya is like the groove of a barley grain, the shape of the Chakshu Indriya is like a lentil, the shape of the Rasana Indriya is like half a moon, the shape of the Ghrana Indriya is like the flower of a Kadamba tree, and the shape of the Sparshan Indriya is of many types. What helps Nirvritti is called Upakaran. It is also of two types: Baahya Upakaran and Abhyantara Upakaran. Among them, the black and white circles seen in the Chakshu Indriya are the Abhyantara Upakaran of the Chakshu Indriya, and the eyelids, eyelashes (group of hairs), etc., are its Baahya Upakaran. Bhaavendriya is also of two types: Labdhi and Upayog. Among these, the special type of Kshayopa-shama that is the cause of the Nirvritti of the Indriya is called Labdhi, and the support of that Kshayopa-shama is called Upayog.

Page #141:
---------------------------
[16] In the **Chakkhandaga** scripture, the dwelling place of the soul is described.

[1, 1, 34] The effect that occurs to the soul is called **upayoga** (use). This means that the specific reduction of the **jnana-avaran** (veil of knowledge) that empowers the soul to perceive matter is called **labdhi-bhavedriya** (sense organ of attainment). The specific activity of the soul in relation to the perception of matter, which is based on this reduction of the veil, is called **upayoga-bhavedriya** (sense organ of use).

The type of sense organ that is described as being in accordance with the **anuvada** (translation) or **agama** (scripture) is called **indriyanuvada** (sense organ translation). 

**Ekaindriya** (one-sense) beings are those who have only one primary sense organ. 

The **sparshan indriya** (sense of touch) is the sense organ by which the soul perceives the tangible qualities of matter. This sense organ arises due to the reduction of the **virya-antaraya** (obstacle of potency) and **sparshaneindriya-avaran** (veil of the sense of touch) karmas, and the support of the **angopaanga** (limbs and parts) **namakarma** (name karma). The five **ekaindriya** beings are earth, water, fire, air, and plants. These beings are called **ekaindriya** (stationary) because they perceive matter only through the sense of touch.

The **rasana indriya** (sense of taste) is the sense organ by which the soul perceives taste. This sense organ arises due to the reduction of the **virya-antaraya** and **rasaneindriya-avaran** karmas, and the support of the **angopaanga** **namakarma**. Beings with these two sense organs are called **dviindriya** (two-sense) beings. Examples of **dviindriya** beings include worms, oysters, conch shells, and **gandola** (large worms that live in the stomach).

Beings with the sense of touch, taste, and smell are called **triindriya** (three-sense) beings. The **ghrana indriya** (sense of smell) is the sense organ by which the soul perceives smell. This sense organ arises due to the reduction of the **virya-antaraya** and **ghraneindriya-avaran** karmas, and the support of the **angopaanga** **namakarma**. Examples of **triindriya** beings include ants, bedbugs, lice, and scorpions.

The **chakshu indriya** (sense of sight) is the sense organ by which the soul perceives form. This sense organ arises due to the reduction of the **virya-antaraya** and **chakshuindriya-avaran** karmas, and the support of the **angopaanga** **namakarma**. Beings with the sense of touch, taste, smell, and sight are called **chaturindriya** (four-sense) beings. Examples of **chaturindriya** beings include spiders, wasps, bees, mosquitoes, moths, flies, and insects that sting.

The **shrotra indriya** (sense of hearing) is the sense organ by which the soul perceives sound. This sense organ arises due to the reduction of the **virya-antaraya** and **shrotreindriya-avaran** karmas, and the support of the **angopaanga** **namakarma**. Beings with all five sense organs are called **panchendriya** (five-sense) beings. Examples of **panchendriya** beings include sweat-born, **sammucchim** (born from moisture), **udbhij** (born from plants), **auppadik** (born from decay), **rasajanit** (born from sap), **pot** (born from eggs), **andaj** (born from eggs), and **jarayuj** (born from the womb).

Beings who have no sense organs are called **anindriya** (no-sense) beings. These are the **sharira-rahita** (bodyless) **siddha** (liberated) souls. Since they do not perceive matter through the **kshaya-upashmika** (reduction of the veil) knowledge that is dependent on the sense organs, their knowledge and happiness are considered **atindriya** (beyond the senses), **atmotha** (self-arisen), and **khaadhin** (dependent on the void).

Now, to explain the different types of **ekaindriya** beings, the following **uttara sutra** (answer verse) is given:

**Ekaindriya duviha badara suhuma. Badara duviha pajjata apjatta, suhuma duviha pajjata apjatta.** || 34 ||

**Ekaindriya** beings are of two types: **badara** (gross) and **suhuma** (subtle). Among the **badara** beings, there are two types: **pajjata** (sufficient) and **apjatta** (insufficient). Among the **suhuma** beings, there are also two types: **pajjata** and **apjatta**. || 34 ||

Page #142:
---------------------------
[1, 1, 34]
The beings whose badar karma is active are called badar. Those whose subtle karma is active are called subtle. The badar karma produces a body that can be prevented from arising by other material substances, while the subtle karma produces a body that cannot be prevented from arising by other material substances.
1
Both badar and subtle are of two types, sufficient and insufficient. Those who have the active sufficient karma are called sufficient, and those who have the active insufficient karma are called insufficient. Sufficient beings are produced by these six sufficiencies: food sufficiency, body sufficiency, sense organ sufficiency, breath sufficiency, speech sufficiency, and mind sufficiency.

The attainment of the pudgala skandha, which is in the form of food category and is associated with the soul, due to the power of transformation from the form of the rough part and the juice part, is called food sufficiency. This food sufficiency is completed within one antarmukhurta from the time of taking the body. The attainment of the pudgala skandha, which is endowed with the power of the three bodies, namely, the audarik, etc., which are transformed from the form of the rough part into the form of bones, etc., hard components, and from the form of the juice part into the form of juice, blood, fat, and semen, etc., fluid components, is called body sufficiency. This body sufficiency is completed within one antarmukhurta after food sufficiency. The attainment of the pudgala, which helps in the generation of the power of taking the substance, which is specific in form, etc., located in the appropriate place, is called sense organ sufficiency. This sense organ sufficiency is completed within one antarmukhurta after body sufficiency. The attainment of the pudgala, which is the cause of the generation of the power in the form of inhalation and exhalation, is called breath sufficiency. This sufficiency is completed within one antarmukhurta after sense organ sufficiency. The attainment of the pudgala, which is the cause of the power of transformation into four types of speech from the skandha of the speech category, is called speech sufficiency. This is also completed within one antarmukhurta after breath sufficiency. The pudgala, which is generated from the skandha of the mind category and is instrumental in the power of remembering the experienced object, is called mind sufficiency. Or, the power of remembering the experienced object, which is generated from the support of the dravya mind, is called mind sufficiency. The beginning of all these six sufficiencies occurs simultaneously, because their existence is considered from the time of birth. But their completion occurs sequentially. The incompleteness of these sufficiencies is called insufficiency. Those beings whose body sufficiency is not completed due to the active insufficient karma and who die in between are called insufficient. Even when the sufficient karma is active, the state until the sufficiencies are completed is called nirvritti sufficient.

Thus, having stated the distinctions of the one-sensed beings, the next sutra is said to state the distinctions of the two-sensed, etc., beings.
Ch 3

Page #143:
---------------------------
[18]
In the six realms, the living beings are:
[1, 1, 35] The two-sense beings are of two types: sufficient and insufficient. The three-sense beings are of two types: sufficient and insufficient. The four-sense beings are of two types: sufficient and insufficient. The five-sense beings are of two types: cognizant and non-cognizant. The cognizant beings are of two types: sufficient and insufficient. The non-cognizant beings are also of two types: sufficient and insufficient. || 35 ||

The nature of the two-sense and other beings has been explained. Among the five-sense beings, some are without mind and some are with mind. Those with mind are called cognizant or samanaska, and those without mind are called non-cognizant or amanaska. That mind is of two types, based on the difference between substance and emotion. Those that are transformed into mind-substance due to the arising of the karma called pudgala-vipaki angopanga, are called substance-mind. And the purity that arises in the soul due to the destruction and cessation of the karma called virya-antaraya and no-indriya-avaran, is called emotional-mind.

Now, to establish the definite number of the qualities in the senses, the next sutra says:
E-indriya, bi-indriya, ti-indriya, chau-indriya, asan-ni-panch-indriya, ekamhi cheva micch-a-it-th-a-ne || 36 ||

The one-sense, two-sense, three-sense, four-sense, and non-cognizant five-sense beings are all in the first quality-place called false-belief. || 36 ||

To negate the numbers two, three, etc., the word 'one' has been used in the sutra, and to negate the other quality-places like sasadana, etc., the word 'false-belief' has been used.

Now, to establish the number of quality-places in the five-sense beings, the next sutra says:
Panch-indriya, asan-ni-panch-indriya-ppa-hudi, jaav, a-yogik-kevali, ti || 37 ||

The five-sense beings are from the non-cognizant five-sense false-belief quality-place up to the non-yogic-kevali quality-place. || 37 ||

Although the kevalis have completely lost their emotional senses and the activity of their substance senses has also ceased, they are still called five-sense beings due to the substance senses that arose from the emotional senses in the state of concealment.

Now, to establish the existence of the super-sensory beings, the next sutra says:
Tan, parama-ni-indriya, idi || 38 ||

Page #144:
---------------------------
[1, 1, 40]
Santparuvanaaye Kaayammagganaa
[19
Beyond the one-sensed etc. beings, there are the non-sensed beings. || 38 ||
In the sutra, the word 'ten' is indicative of the species. The word 'paran' means above. From this, it means that the beings devoid of the species distinctions of one-sensed etc. are non-sensed, because their entire dravyakarma and bhaavakarma have been destroyed.
Now, to expound the Kaayamargana, the next sutra says.....
Kaayaanuvaadena Atthi Pudhavikaaiyaa Aaukaaiyaa Teukaaiyaa Vaaukaaiyaa Vanapphaikkaaiyaa Taskaaiyaa Akaaiyaa Chedi || 39 ||
By the translation of the body, there are earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, air-bodied, plant-bodied, tremor-bodied and bodiless (without body) beings. || 39 ||
The statement according to the sutra is called translation. The translation of the body is called kaayaanuvaad. The earth-like body is called the earth-body. The beings who have this body are called earth-bodied. Or, the beings who are under the influence of the earth-bodied name-karma are called earth-bodied. In this way, the beings situated in the karman-body-yoga also become known as earth-bodied, because even though they do not have an earth-like body, they experience the rise of the earth-bodied name-karma. In the same way, the meaning of the words water-bodied etc. should also be understood. Due to the special quality arising from the rise of the stationary name-karma, all these five beings are called stationary. The beings who are associated with the rise of the tremor name-karma are called tremor-bodied. Those whose tremor and stationary name-karma have been destroyed are called bodiless. Just as gold, due to its association with fire, becomes free from both external and internal impurities like soot and blackness, in the same way, this being, due to its association with the fire of meditation, becomes free from the body and karma-bondage and becomes bodiless.
Now, to expound the distinctions of the earth-bodied etc. beings, the next sutra says
Pudhavikaaiyaa Duvihaa Baadaraa Suhuma. Baadaraa Duvihaa Panjatta Appajatta. Suhuma Duvihaa Pajatta Appajatta. Aaukaaiyaa Duvihaa Baadaraa Suhuma. Baadaraa Duvihaa Panjatta Appajatta. Suhuma Duvihaa Pajatta Appajatta. Teukaaiyaa Duvihaa Baadaraa Suhuma. Baadaraa Duvihaa Panjatta Appajatta. Suhuma Duvihaa Pajatta Appajatta. Vaaukaaiyaa Duvihaa Baadaraa Suhuma. Baadaraa Duvihaa Panjatta Appajatta. Suhuma Duvihaa Pajatta Appajatta Chedi || 40 ||
Earth-bodied beings are basically of two types - coarse and subtle. Coarse earth-bodied beings are also of two types - sufficient and insufficient. Similarly, subtle earth-bodied beings are also of two types - sufficient and insufficient. Water-bodied beings are of two types - coarse and subtle. Coarse water-bodied beings are of two types - sufficient and insufficient. Subtle water-bodied beings are of two types - sufficient and insufficient.

---------------------------
[20] In the **Chakkhandaga** (Six-Part) **Gama** (Scripture), the classification of living beings is as follows:

[1, 1, 41] **Agnikayika** (Fire-bodied) beings are of two types: **Badara** (Gross) and **Sukshma** (Subtle). **Badara** **Agnikayika** beings are further divided into two types: **Paryapta** (Sufficient) and **Aparyapta** (Insufficient). **Sukshma** **Agnikayika** beings are also of two types: **Paryapta** and **Aparyapta**. 

**Vayukayika** (Air-bodied) beings are of two types: **Badara** and **Sukshma**. **Badara** **Vayukayika** beings are further divided into two types: **Paryapta** and **Aparyapta**. **Sukshma** **Vayukayika** beings are also of two types: **Paryapta** and **Aparyapta**. || 40 ||

Those whose bodies are gross due to the arising of **Badara** **Karma** (Action) are called **Badara**. Those whose bodies are free from obstruction due to the arising of **Sukshma** **Karma** are called **Sukshma**. **Badara** refers to a gross body that can obstruct others and be obstructed by others. Similarly, **Sukshma** means not being able to obstruct others and not being obstructed by others. **Trasa** (Hell) beings are only **Badara**, not **Sukshma**.

Now, to explain the categories of **Vanaspatikayika** (Plant-bodied) beings, the next sutra (aphorism) states:

**Vanappai-kaiya duviha patteya-sarira sadharana-sarira**. **Patteya-sarira duviha pajjatta appajatta**. **Sadharana-sarira duviha badara suhuma**. **Badara duviha pajjatta appajatta**. **Suhuma duviha pajjatta appajatta chedi**. || 41 ||

**Vanaspatikayika** beings are of two types: **Pratyeka-sarira** (Individual-bodied) and **Sadharana-sarira** (Common-bodied). **Pratyeka-sarira** **Vanaspatikayika** beings are further divided into two types: **Paryapta** and **Aparyapta**. **Sadharana-sarira** **Vanaspatikayika** beings are also of two types: **Badara** and **Sukshma**. **Badara** beings are of two types: **Paryapta** and **Aparyapta**. **Sukshma** beings are also of two types: **Paryapta** and **Aparyapta**. || 41 ||

Those who have **Pratyeka** (Individual) bodies, meaning separate and distinct bodies, are called **Pratyeka-sarira** beings. For example, the **Khair** (Acacia Catechu) tree and other plants. Although according to this characteristic, the remaining five stationary beings, such as those with **Prithvi-kaya** (Earth-body), are also **Pratyeka-sarira**, they are not called so because they do not have any other irrefutable distinction like **Sadharana-sarira**.

Those beings who do not have **Pratyeka** (Individual) bodies, but have a single body in a common form, are called **Sadharana-sarira** beings. These beings have common food and common breathing. Similarly, where one dies, an infinite number of beings die, and where one is born, an infinite number of beings are born. In such a single **Nigoda** (Cluster) body, there are **Siddharaashi** (Liberated Souls) and an infinite number of beings from all past times, all residing in the same form. In the eternal **Nigoda**, there are countless infinite beings who have not yet experienced the **Trasa** (Hell) state, and who, due to the arising of intense **Kashaya** (Negative Emotions), remain extremely polluted by the consequences of **Durleshya** (Difficult to Overcome) **Karma**. Therefore, they never leave the **Nigoda** state.

Now, to explain the categories of **Trasa-kayika** (Hell-bodied) beings, the next sutra states:

**Trasa-kaiya duviha pajjatta appajatta**. || 42 ||

**Trasa-kayika** beings are of two types: **Paryapta** and **Aparyapta**. || 42 ||

Page #146:
---------------------------
[1, 1, 47]
The path of liberation, the path of the saints
[21
Those who have attained the Trasa Paryaya due to the rise of the Trasa Karma are called Trasa beings. Among them, there are many beings with two senses, many with three senses, many with four senses, and many with all five senses.
After stating the nature of the Earth-bodied beings, etc., the following sutra is said to describe the Gunasthanas in them.
Prithvikaayika, Jalakaayika, Agnikaiya, Vaayukaayika, and Vanaspatikaayika beings are all in the Gunasthana called Mithyaadrishti. || 43 ||
Now, to describe the Gunasthanas of the Trasa beings, the following sutra is said.
Tasaikaaya, Beeindriya, Pahudi, Jaav, Ajogikevali, Tti. || 44 ||
Kaayika beings are from Dwiiindriya to Ajogikevali. || 44 || Now, to describe the Gunasthanas of the Baadar beings, the following sutra is said.
Baadaraikaaya, Baadareiindriyappahudi, Jaav, Ajogikevali, Tti. || 45 ||
Baadaraikaayika beings are from Ekeindriya beings to Ajogikevali. || 45 || Now, to describe the existence of beings who are devoid of these two bodies, the following sutra is said.
Te, Parakaayiya, Chedi. || 46 ||
There are Akaayika (bodyless) beings who are devoid of both the Sthavar and the Sa Kaaya. || 46 ||
Those who are devoid of the two types of bodies, Sthavar and Sa, are called Siddha beings, because they are devoid of the Baadar and the subtle body, and the Karma that is the cause of the body.
Now, to describe the Jiva dravya through the path of liberation, the following sutra is said.
Jogaanuvaadena, Aththi, Manajogi, Vachijogi, Kaayajogi, Chedi. || 47 ||
According to the path of liberation, there are Manajogi, Vachanajogi, and Kaayajogi beings. || 47 ||
The effort that is made for the origin of the mind is called Manajoga, the effort that is made for the origin of speech is called Vachanajoga, and the effort that is made for the origin of the action of the body is called Kaayajoga. One who has Manajoga is called Manajogi. Similarly, the meaning of Vachanajogi and Kaayajogi should also be understood.
Now, to describe the beings who are devoid of yoga, the following sutra is said.

Page #147:
---------------------------
##  [22]
**Chhakkanḍāgame Jīvadvāṇam**
**Ajogī Chedi || 48 ||**
**Ajogī Jīva Hote Hain || 48 ||**
Those Jīvas whose auspicious and inauspicious yogas, which are the producers of punya and pāpa, have ceased to exist, are called Ajogī Jinas, who are unparalleled and endowed with infinite strength.

Now, to expound the divisions of manoyoga, the Uttar-sūtra says:
**[1, 1, 48]**
**Maṇajogo Chavviho Saccamaṇajogo Mosamaṇajogo Saccamoṣamaṇajogo Asaccamoṣamaṇajogo Chedi || 49 ||**
Manoyoga is of four types: Satya-manoyoga, Mṛṣā-manoyoga, Satya-mṛṣā-manoyoga, and Asatya-mṛṣā-manoyoga || 49 ||

The mind that is directed towards truth is called Satya-man, and the yoga that arises from it is called Satya-manoyoga. The yoga opposite to this is called Mṛṣā-manoyoga. The yoga that arises from the combination of truth and falsehood is called Satya-mṛṣā-manoyoga. The yoga that is different from Satya-manoyoga and Mṛṣā-manoyoga is called Asatya-mṛṣā-manoyoga. The meaning is that wherever a particular type of object exists, the mind that is directed towards it in that way is called Satya-man, and the mind that is opposite to it is called Asatya-man. The mind that is both true and false is called Ubhayamaṇ. The mind that is the cause of knowledge that is in the form of doubt and indecision is called Anubhayaman. The yogas (special efforts) that arise from all these are called Satya-manoyoga, etc., respectively.

Having stated the divisions of manoyoga, the Uttar-sūtra now says to describe its nature in the guṇasthānas:
**Maṇajogo Saccamaṇajogo Asaccamoṣamaṇajogo Saṇṇimicchāiṭṭhipp Huḍi Jāv Sajogikevaliti || 50 ||**
Manoyoga, Satya-manoyoga, and Asatya-mṛṣā-manoyoga exist from Saṇṇimicchāiṭṭhipp to Sajogikevali || 50 ||

**Question:** Does the Satya-manoyoga of the Kevali Bhagavan exist, because there is the existence of true knowledge of the object? But his Asatya-mṛṣā-manoyoga is not possible, because there is no doubt or indecision in his knowledge?

**Answer:** This is not so, because there can be Anubhay dharma in it, as the mind is the cause of the past speech due to doubt and indecision. Therefore, there is no contradiction in accepting the existence of Anubhayamanoyoga in the Sajogī Jinas.

Page #148:
---------------------------
[1, 1, 53]
The Path of the Saint
[23
Question - What is meant by the statement that the words of a Kevali (omniscient being) give rise to doubt and indecision? Answer - Since the objects of knowledge of a Kevali are infinite and the listener's covering karma is not completely destroyed, doubt and indecision can arise in the listener due to the words of the Kevali.
Now, to explain the qualities of the remaining two types of manoyog (mental application), the Uttar Sutra says:
Mosamanajogo SaccamoSamanajogo SanniMicchaittHipp Hudi Jav Khiinakasayaviyaray-Chhadumatttha Ti || 51 ||
Mrishamanoyog (false mental application) and Satyamrishamanoyog (true-false mental application) are found from the Mithyadristi Gunasthan (quality-place) of false belief to the Khinakashaya-Vitrarag-Chhadmasth Gunasthan (quality-place of subtle passions, passionless, and veiled). || 51 ||
Question - Mrishamanoyog and Asatyamrishamanoyog (false-false mental application) are caused by carelessness. Since carelessness is destroyed in the case of Upashamik (subdued) and Kshapik (destroyed) beings, how are these two types of manoyog possible in their case? Answer - Since covering karma is present up to the twelfth Gunasthan, there is no contradiction in accepting that both types of manoyog, which are the cause of ignorance in the form of delusion and indecision, are present in veiled beings. Now, to explain the types of Vachanayog (speech application), the Uttar Sutra says:
Vachijogo Chavviho SacchaVachijogo Mosavachijogo SacchaMosavachijogo AsacchaMosavachijogo Chedi || 52 ||
Vachanayog is of four types - SatyaVachanayog (true speech application), MrishaVachanayog (false speech application), SatyaMrishaVachanayog (true-false speech application), and AsatyaMrishaVachanayog (false-false speech application). || 52 ||
The type of yog that occurs due to the Vachanvargana (category of speech) in the ten types of truth, such as Janapad (country), etc., is called SatyaVachanayog. The opposite of this is called MrishaVachanayog. The type of Vachanayog that is both true and false is called UbhayanVachanayog. That which is neither true nor false is called AsatyaMrishaVachanayog. For example, the language of Asangi (non-conscious) beings and the language of invitation of Sanghi (conscious) beings.
Having thus explained the types of Vachanayog, the Uttar Sutra now explains its presence in the Gunasthanas:
Vachijogo Asac Mosavachijogo Biindiya Pahadi Jav Sajogikevali Tti || 53 || Vachanayog and AsatyaMrishaVachanayog are present from the Dwiiindriya (two-sense) beings to the Sajogikevali Gunasthan (quality-place of liberated being with attachments). || 53 ||
Question - If we accept that the words that arise due to the mind, which is in the form of experience, are called Anubhavchan (experience-speech), then how is Anubhavchan possible in the case of Dwiiindriya (two-sense) beings, etc., who do not have a mind?

Page #149:
---------------------------
[24] In the six-fold division of the universe, the presence of speech is found in all living beings.
[1, 1, 54] It is not a fixed rule that all speech originates from the mind. If it were so, then the speech of the liberated souls, who are devoid of mind, would be absent. Therefore, even in the absence of mind in beings from the two-sensed to the five-sensed non-conscious, speech exists. If it is argued that since knowledge cannot arise without the mind in beings with impaired senses, their speech is also not possible without knowledge, this argument is also not correct. It is not a fixed rule that knowledge originates only from the mind. If it is assumed that knowledge originates only from the mind, then in that case, knowledge will not be able to arise from all the senses. The mind is not even an aid to the senses, because sensory knowledge arises from the senses, which require effort and the cooperation of the soul.

Now, to explain the nature of the true speech yoga in the various stages of spiritual progress, the Uttar Sutra says:
"Saccvavcijogo sanni micchaitippahudi jav sajogikevali ti." [54]
True speech yoga exists from the stage of the deluded with false views to the stage of the liberated with associated karma. [54]

This is because there is no contradiction in the presence of ten types of true speech in the thirteen stages of spiritual progress, starting from the deluded with false views.

To explain the nature of the remaining speech yogas in the various stages of spiritual progress, the Uttar Sutra says:
"Mosavacijogo saccmosavacijogo sanni micchaitippahudi jav khinakasayaviyaraga-chadumatta ti." [55]
False speech yoga and true-false speech yoga exist from the stage of the deluded with false views to the stage of the liberated with subtle passions, free from passions, and with subtle obscurations. [55]

Question: How is false speech possible for those whose passions are subtle, those who are liberated with subtle passions, free from passions, and with subtle obscurations?

Answer: The cause of false speech is ignorance, which exists up to the twelfth stage of spiritual progress. Therefore, there is no obstacle to the existence of false speech yoga in them.

Now, to explain the number of body yogas, the Uttar Sutra says:
"Kayajogo sattaviho oraliyakayajogo oraliyamisskayajogo veuvviyakayajogo veuvbhiyamisskayajogo aharakayajogo aharamisskayajogo kammanikayajogo chedi." [56]
Body yoga is of seven types: noble body yoga, mixed noble body yoga, active body yoga, mixed active body yoga, food-related body yoga, mixed food-related body yoga, and karma-related body yoga. [56]

Page #150:
---------------------------
[1, 1, 59]
Santparuvanaaye Jogmagganaa
[25
The effort that is the cause of pulsation in the realms of the living being, which is produced by the Audarik body, is called Audarikkaayayog. Puru, Mahat, Udar and Ural are synonyms. What is in Udar is called Audarik and the yoga that happens because of it is called Audarikkaayayog. This Audarik body is called mixed until it is complete. The yoga that happens because of it is called Audarikmischrakaayayog. The body that is combined with many powers like Aṇimā - Mahimā etc. is called Vaikriyika body and the yoga that happens because of it is called Vaikriyikaayayog. This Vaikriyika body is called mixed until it is complete. The yoga that happens because of it is called Vaikriyikmischrakaayayog.
The body by which the soul takes in subtle substances is called Aahaarak body and the yoga that happens because of that Aahaarak body is called Aahaarakkaayayog. The meaning is that when a subtle doubt arises in the mind of a Muni who is in the sixth Gunasthan, the body by which he goes to the Kevali and takes in subtle substances is called Aahaarak body and the yoga that happens because of it is called Aahaarakkaayayog. This Aahaarak body is called Aahaarakmischra until it is complete. The yoga that happens because of it is called Aahaarakmischrakaayayog. This Aahaarak body is subtle, so when it moves, it does not collide with mountains, nor is it pierced by weapons, nor does it burn in fire, like the Vaikriyika body.
The eight types of Karma skandhas like Jñānaāvaraṇa etc. are called Kārmaṇa body. Or, the body that is produced by the rise of Nāmakarma is called Kārmaṇa body. The yoga that happens because of it is called Kārmaṇakaayayog. This yoga happens for one, two or three times.
Now, to explain who has Audarikkaayayog and Audarikmischrakaayayog, the next Sutra says
Oralikaayajogo Oralimisskaayajogo Tirikkh- Maṇussāṇam || 57 || Audarikkaayayog and Audarikmischrakaayayog happen to the Tiryanch and humans || 57 || Now, to explain which beings have Vaikriyikaayayog and Vaikriyikmischrakaayayog, the next Sutra says -
Ch 4
Vkiaayajogo Ve Vtriyamisskaayajogo Dev- Raiyāṇam || 58 || Vaikriyikaayayog and Vaikriyikmischrakaayayog happen to the Devas and Narakas || 58 || Now, to explain the owner of Aahaarakkaayayog, the next Sutra says
Aahaarakayajogo Aahaar Missskaayajogo Sanjadaanimidhipattaanam || 59 ||

##  The Sixfold Division of the Universe and the Karma Body

**Chapter 1, Section 1, Verse 60**

"The *āhārakakāya yoga* and *āhārakamishrakāya yoga* are only attained by those who are *prāmmatta* (distracted) and *samyata* (restrained) with *ṛddhi* (supernatural powers). || 59 || Now, to explain the nature of the *kārmmaṇakāya* (karma body) and its owner, the following sūtra is stated: *Kammaikāya jōgō viggahagah samāvaṇṇāṇam kevalīṇam vā samugdhādagadāṇam* || 60 || The *kārmmaṇakāya yoga* is attained by those who have achieved *vigraha gati* (the motion of the karma body) and by the *kevali* (omniscient) who have achieved *samudghāta* (expansion of the soul). || 60 ||

The motion that occurs for the attainment of a new body is called *vigraha gati*. Alternatively, the word *vigraha* also means "crookedness". Therefore, the motion that occurs with *vigraha*, i.e., with crookedness (with a bend), is called *vigraha gati*. Those who have achieved *vigraha gati* have *kārmmaṇakāya yoga*. The *kārmmaṇakāya* is the seed-like body from which all other bodies are born. *Yoga* is the pulsation of the soul's regions due to the *vacaṇavarggaṇā* (speech-group), *manōvarggaṇā* (mind-group), and *kāyavarggaṇā* (body-group). The *yoga* that arises from the *kārmmaṇakāya* is called *kārmmaṇakāya yoga*. It is present in those who are in *vigraha gati*.

**Chapter 26**

A being's motion from one state to another is of four types: *iṣu gati*, *pāṇimuktā gati*, *lāngalikā gati*, and *gōmūtrikā gati*. *Iṣu gati* is the motion without a bend, like an arrow released from a bow. This motion takes one moment. *Pāṇimuktā gati* is the motion with one bend, like the motion of an object thrown obliquely from the hand. This motion takes two moments. *Lāngalikā gati* is the motion with two bends, like the two bends of a plow. This motion takes three moments. *Gōmūtrikā gati* is the motion with three bends, like the multiple bends of a cow's urine while walking. This motion takes four moments. Of these, *kārmmaṇakāya yoga* is present in all three motions except *iṣu gati*. The series of sky regions that exist above, below, and diagonally from the region where a being is located is called a *śreṇī*. Beings move through this *śreṇī*. A being in *vigraha gati* has a maximum of three bends, because there is no place where more than three bends are required to reach.

*Samudghāta* is the expansion of the soul's regions beyond the body without leaving the original body. *Kevala samudghāta* is the expansion of the soul's regions upwards, downwards, and diagonally to equalize the uneven state of the *aghātiya karma* (non-violent karma) of the *kevali* (omniscient). This is completed within eight moments. Of these, four moments are spent in the expansion of the soul's regions, and the next four moments are spent in their contraction. During the *kapātarūpa samudghāta* (expansion of the soul in the form of a lid), there is *audārikamishrakāya yoga*, and during the subsequent *pratar* (intermediate state) and *lōkapūraṇa* (filling of the world), there is *kārmmaṇakāya yoga*.

Now, to explain the knowledge of *kāyayoga* in the *guṇasthāna* (stages of development), the next four sūtras are stated.

[1, 1, 65] Santparuvanaae Jogmaggnaa
[27 _ Kaayajogo Oralikaayajogo Oralimisskaayajogo Aeindiyapphudi Jaav Sajogikevali Tti || 61 ||
Kaayajoga, Audarikakaayajoga and Audarikamissrakaayajoga are from Ekaindriya to Sajogikevali. || 61 ||
Here it is important to know that Audarikamissrakaayajoga is only in the four Aaparyapt Gunasthanas.
Now, to explain the Swami of Vaikriyikaayajoga, the Uttar Sutra says -
Veuvviyakaayajogo Veuvviyamisskaajogo Sanni micchaaitipphudi Jaav Asanjad Sammaitti Tti || 62 ||
Vaikriyikaayajoga and Vaikriyikamissrakaayajoga are from Sanjnee Mithyadristi to Asanyat Samyagdristi. || 62 ||
Here it is important to know that in the Samyagmithyadristi Gunasthan, the Jiva is always Paryapt, and Vaikriyikamissrakaayajoga is only for Aaparyapt.
Now, to explain the Swami of Aahaarakaayajoga, the Uttar Sutra says ..... Aahaarakaayajogo Aahaaramisskaayajogo Ekkamhi Chev Pamattasanjadhaane ||63|| Aahaarakaayajoga and Aahaaramissrakaayajoga are only in the one Pramatt Gunasthan. || 63 ||
Now, to explain the Jivas who are the basis of Kaarmanakaayajoga, the Uttar Sutra says  Kammaiyakaayajogo Aeindiyapphudi Jaav Sajogikevali Tti. || 64 || Kaarmanakaayajoga is from Ekaindriya to Sajogikevali. || 64 ||
Here it is important to know that in the ten Paryapt Dashamas, such Gunasthanas like Sanyata Sanyataadi are not possible. In the Paryapt state, it is only found at the time of Samudghat.
Further, to explain the Swami of all three Yogas together, the Uttar Sutra says
Manajogo Vachijogo Kaayajogo Sanni micchaaitipphudi Jaav Sajogikevali Tti. || 65 ||
In terms of Kshayopaashama, having attained Ekrupa, Manoyoga, Vachanayoga and Kaayajoga, these three Yogas are from Sanjnee Mithyadristi to Sajogikevali. || 65 ||
Now, to explain the Dvisanyogi Yogas, the Uttar Sutra says -

The Sixfold Division of the Universe: The State of the Soul

[1, 1, 66]
Vachan Yoga and Kaya Yoga exist from the two-sense beings to the five-sense beings without consciousness. [66] Now, to explain the nature of the one-sense beings, the next Sutra says: Kaya Yoga is for the one-sense beings. [67]

The meaning is that the one-sense beings have only Kaya Yoga, the two-sense beings to the five-sense beings without consciousness have Vachan and Kaya Yoga, and the remaining (Samanask) beings have all three Yogas.

Thus, having explained the existence of Yoga in general, the next Sutra explains which Yoga is present and which is absent at what time and for whom:

Mano Yoga and Vachan Yoga are present for the Perfect, but not for the Imperfect. [68] Now, to explain the existence of Kaya Yoga in general, the next Sutra says: Kaya Yoga is present for both the Perfect and the Imperfect. [69]

Now, to explain the number of Perfections and Imperfections that make a being Perfect or Imperfect, the next Sutra says:

There are six Perfections and six Imperfections. [70]

The completeness of the power that produces food, body, senses, inhalation-exhalation, speech, and mind is called Perfection. These six Perfections are: Food Perfection, Body Perfection, Sense Perfection, Inhalation-Exhalation Perfection, Speech Perfection, and Mind Perfection. The incompleteness of these six Perfections is called Imperfection. These six Imperfections are also: Food Imperfection, Body Imperfection, Sense Imperfection, Inhalation-Exhalation Imperfection, Speech Imperfection, and Mind Imperfection (see page 17).

Now, to explain the basis of these Perfections, the next Sutra says:

From the conscious false belief to the un-restrained right belief. [71]

The aforementioned six Perfections and six Imperfections exist from the conscious false belief to the un-restrained right belief. [71]

The Path of Liberation for the Saints
[29
Not all beings have six perfections, but some have five and some have four. To explain this, the following four sutras are spoken.
Five perfections, five imperfections. || 72 || There are five perfections and five imperfections. || 72 ||
Although these five perfections are included in the above six perfections, some beings have all six perfections, while others have only five. This particularity is shown by this separate sutra. Here, the mind perfection is excluded, and the remaining five perfections are intended.
To remove the doubt about who has these five perfections and five imperfections, the following sutra is spoken:
From the two-sensory beings to the non-cognizant five-sensory beings. || 73 || The above five perfections and five imperfections are from the two-sensory beings to the non-cognizant five-sensory beings. || 73 ||
To explain the existence of the number of perfections in more detail, the following sutra is spoken:
Four perfections, four imperfections. || 74 || There are four perfections and four imperfections. || 74 ||
Some beings have only these four perfections and imperfections: food perfection, body perfection, sensory perfection, and breath perfection. Similarly, the four imperfections should also be understood.
Now, to explain the beings who have these four perfections and four imperfections, the following sutra is spoken:
One-sensory beings. || 75 ||
These four perfections and four imperfections, devoid of speech and mind perfection-imperfections, are only for one-sensory beings. || 75 ||
Thus, after explaining the perfections and imperfections, the following sutra is spoken to state that this yoga is present in a certain being and this yoga is not present in a certain being:
Audaricakayayoga is for the perfections, and Audaricamisrakayayoga is for the imperfections. || 76 || Audaricakayayoga is for the perfections, and Audaricamisrakayayoga is for the imperfections. || 76 ||

## Chapter 6, Section 1, Verse 77

**A living being is called a *paryāpta* when its *śarīra* is complete.** When a living being attains completeness, the *yoga* that arises from the pulsation of the *jīva-pradeśa* due to the support of the *audārika-śarīra* is called *audārika-kāya-yoga*. The *yoga* that arises from the pulsation of the *jīva-pradeśa* due to the *karma* and *audārika* *skandha* is called *audārika-miśra-kāya-yoga*. This occurs when the *audārika-śarīra* is incomplete. Even though the *karma-śarīra* is present in a complete state, it does not cause the pulsation of the *jīva-pradeśa* and therefore *audārika-miśra-kāya-yoga* does not occur in a complete state.

**Now, to establish the existence of *vaikriyika-kāya-yoga*, the following *uttara-sūtra* is stated:**

*vaikriyika-kāya-yoga* is present in *paryāpta* *deva* and *nārika*, and *vaikriyika-miśra-kāya-yoga* is present in *aparyāpta*.

## Chapter 6, Section 1, Verse 78

**Now, to explain the basis of *āhāra-kāya-yoga*, the following *uttara-sūtra* is stated:**

*āhāra-kāya-yoga* is present in *paryāpta* and *āhāra-miśra-kāya-yoga* is present in *aparyāpta*.

Even though the *audārika-śarīra* of a *sādhu* who creates an *āhāra-śarīra* is complete, the *āhāra-śarīra* that is produced is not complete until it is complete. Until then, the *pramatta-samyata* *jīva* who produces it is considered *aparyāpta* in relation to that *śarīra*.

## Chapter 6, Section 1, Verse 79

**Thus, having stated the presence and absence of *yoga* in *paryāpta* and *aparyāpta*, the following *uttara-sūtra* is stated to explain the presence and absence of *guṇa-sthāna* in *paryāpta* and *aparyāpta* related to the four *gati*.**

*Nārika* *jīva* are sometimes *paryāpta* and sometimes *aparyāpta* in the *guṇa-sthāna* of *mithyā-dṛṣṭi* and *asam-yata-samyag-dṛṣṭi*.

## Chapter 6, Section 1, Verse 80

**Now, to explain the position of the remaining two *guṇa-sthāna* related to *nārika*, the following *uttara-sūtra* is stated:**

*Nārika* *jīva* are always *paryāpta* in the *guṇa-sthāna* of *sāsādana-samyag-dṛṣṭi* and *samyag-mithyā-dṛṣṭi*.

[1, 1, 83]
The path of liberation for the saints
[31
The meaning is that those who have attained all six perfections are reborn as hell beings with these two qualities, but they are not reborn with these qualities in the imperfect state. The reason is that there is no possibility of the results that are the cause of the origin of these two qualities in the imperfect state of hell beings. Therefore, these two qualities are not found in their imperfect state.
Thus, having spoken generally about hell beings, the Uttar Sutra now speaks specifically about them:
And they are found in the first earth. || 81 ||
The hell beings who are in the first earth have the same possible qualities in their perfect and imperfect states as the general hell beings, there is no difference.
Now, to speak specifically about the hell beings who live in the remaining hells, the Uttar Sutra says:
From the second to the seventh earth, the hell beings are sometimes perfect and sometimes imperfect in the wrong view quality. || 82 ||
Except for the first earth, the remaining six earths are inhabited by beings with wrong view, therefore, both the perfect and imperfect states are mentioned in the first quality.
Now, to explain in which state the remaining qualities are found in those earths and in which state they are not found, the Uttar Sutra says:
From the second to the seventh earth, the hell beings are always perfect in the qualities of right faith, right wrong view, and un-controlled right view. || 83 ||
Beings who are in the right faith quality are not born in hell, because the right faith quality does not bind the hell body. In addition, a being who has already bound the hell body does not become reborn in hell after attaining the right faith quality, because it is not possible for a being who has bound the hell body to die in the right faith quality. Since it is not possible for a being with right wrong view to die at all in this quality, this quality is found only in the perfect state. Un-controlled right view beings are not born in the second and subsequent earths, because the causes for their birth in the remaining six earths are not found.

Page #157:
---------------------------
[32]  In the six realms, the state of living beings
[1, 1, 84] Now, to explain the nature of the Gunasthanas in the Tiryancha (animal) realm, the Uttar Sutra says:
Tiryakkha micchaittthi-sasanasammaiti-asanjadasammaidittthaane sia pajjatta sia apajjatta || 84 ||
Tiryacha (animal) beings are sometimes sufficient and sometimes insufficient in the Gunasthanas of Mithyadrishti (false belief), Sasadan Samyagdristi (right belief with attachment), and Asanjat Samyagdristi (right belief without restraint). || 84 ||
Those beings who have bound the Tiryancha life in the Mithyadrishti state before attaining Samyagdarshan (right vision) are born in the Tiryancha realm with Samyagdarshan, but the remaining Samyagdristi beings are not born there. It is certain that those beings who have bound the Tiryancha life before attaining Samyagdarshan are born in the Bhogbhumi (enjoyment realm) Tiryancha after death, not in the Karmabhumi (action realm) Tiryancha.
Now, to explain the nature of the Gunasthanas like Samyagmithyadrishti etc. in the Tiryancha realm, the Uttar Sutra says:
Sammamichchaidvi-sanjadasanjatthaane niyama pajjatta || 85 || Tiryacha beings are always sufficient in the Gunasthanas of Samyagmithyadrishti (right false belief) and Sanjata-asanjata (restrained-unrestrained). || 85 ||
Here, there may be a doubt that if a being who has bound the Tiryancha life in the Mithyadrishti state and later attained Samyagdarshan along with Sanjama-asanjama (restraint-unrestraint) is born in the Tiryancha realm after death, then his Tiryancha state may be insufficient in the Sanjata-asanjata Gunasthanas. Then, why is the Sanjata-asanjata Gunasthanas of insufficient Tiryancha completely prohibited in such a state? But it is not appropriate to have such a doubt, because the intellect of a being who binds the life related to other realms except the Devagati (heavenly realm) does not arise to accept Anuvrata (minor vows). In addition, there is no possibility of Anuvrata for Kshayik Samyagdristi beings born in the Tiryancha realm in an insufficient state, because if Kshayik Samyagdristi beings are born in the Tiryancha realm after death, they are born in the Bhogbhumi only, and it is not possible for beings born in the Bhogbhumi to accept vows.
Thus, after describing the general nature of the Tiryancha, the Uttar Sutra says to decide their specific nature:
Evam panchindriyatirikkha panchindriyatirikkha-pajjatta || 86 ||
The description of the Panchendriya Tiryancha (five-sense Tiryancha) and the Panchendriya Tiryancha sufficient ones is similar to that of the general Tiryancha. || 86 ||
Now, to state the special feature of the Tiryancha with Strived (female knowledge), the Uttar Sutra says: 
...

Page #158:
---------------------------
##  The Path of Liberation for the Saintly

[33
In the five-sense beings, the states of Mithyadrishti-Sasan and Sammadrishti-Sasan are sometimes sufficient and sometimes insufficient. || 87 ||

A being with the Sasan-guna-sthana, upon death, is not born in the Naraka, but it is possible for it to be born in the Tiryancha. Therefore, even in its insufficient state, the Sasan-guna-sthana can remain. Now, to explain the nature of the remaining guna-sthana possible in the five-sense Tiryancha, the next sutra says:
[1, 1, 91]

The Tiryancha with the five senses are always sufficient in the states of Sammadrishti-Asanjat, Sammadrishti-Sanjat, and Asanjat-Sanjat. || 88 ||

The reason for this is that no being born in any of the above guna-sthana is born in the five-sense Tiryancha upon death. The reason why the guna-sthana of the insufficient Tiryancha is not described here is that, except for the Mithyatva guna-sthana, no other guna-sthana is found in them.

Now, to describe the nature of the guna-sthana in the human realm, the next sutra says:

Humans are sometimes sufficient and sometimes insufficient in the states of Mithyadrishti-Sasan, Sammadrishti-Sasan, and Asanjat-Sammadrishti. || 89 ||

Although it is possible for the Prammat-Sanjat, who produces the Aharak-Sharira, to be insufficient in relation to the six sufficient conditions related to the body, until those conditions are fulfilled, here, in relation to the Dravyarthic Nay, they are considered sufficient even if they do not have all six sufficient conditions related to the Aharak-Sharira. The same should be understood in relation to the Samudghat-Gat Kevali.

I

Now, to explain the different types of humans, the next sutra says:

Thus, the sufficiency of humans. || 91 ||

[5
Now, to explain the presence of the remaining guna-sthana in humans, the next sutra says:

Humans are always sufficient in the states of Sammadrishti-Sanjat, Asanjat-Sanjat, and Sanjat. || 90 ||

Page #159:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

**In the six-fold division of beings, the form of human beings is similar to that of ordinary humans.** || 91 ||

**Now, to describe the qualities of human beings, the Uttar Sutra says:**  "In human beings, the qualities of Mithyadrishti (false belief) and Sasadan Samyagdristi (right belief with attachment) are sometimes sufficient and sometimes insufficient." || 92 ||

**Now, to explain the remaining qualities of human beings, the Uttar Sutra says:** "In the qualities of Samyag Mithyadrishti (right false belief), Asanjad Samyagdristi (right belief without attachment), and Sanjad Asanjad (attached and unattached), the qualities are always sufficient." || 93 ||

**Now, to describe the qualities of the celestial beings, the Uttar Sutra says:** "In the qualities of Dev Mithyadrishti (false belief of celestial beings), Sasadan Samyagdristi (right belief with attachment), and Asanjad Samyagdristi (right belief without attachment), the qualities are sometimes sufficient and sometimes insufficient." || 94 ||

**Now, to explain the existence of the remaining qualities of celestial beings, the Uttar Sutra says:** "In the quality of Samyag Mithyadrishti (right false belief), the qualities are always sufficient." || 95 ||

**The reason for this is that no being dies with the third quality, and the right false belief does not arise in the insufficient period.**

**Now, to describe the forms of celestial beings based on their specific differences, the Uttar Sutra says:** "The Bhavna Vasi, Vanavantar, and Jyotishi Devas (celestial beings) and their goddesses, as well as the Saudharma and Aishana Kalpa Vasi Devis (celestial goddesses), all have the qualities of Mithyadrishti (false belief) and Sasadan Samyagdristi (right belief with attachment), which are sometimes sufficient and sometimes insufficient." || 96 ||

**Since beings with these two qualities are born as the aforementioned Devas and Devis, these two qualities are possible in both sufficient and insufficient states.**

Page #160:

[1, 1, 101]
Santparuvanaae Vedamaggnaa
[35
Now, to explain the impossible Gunasthanas in the inadequate state of the aforementioned Devas and Devis, the Uttar Sutra says -
Sammabhicchaittthi-AsanjadSamm-aittithaane Niyama Pajjattha Niyama Pajjatthiao.
In the Samyagmithyadristi and Asanyatsamyagdristi Gunasthanas, the aforementioned Devas are adequate by rule, and the aforementioned Devis are also adequate by rule. || 97 ||
The reason for this is that no being dies with Samyagmithyatva, and there is also no possibility of Samyagdristi beings dying and being born in the aforementioned Devas and Devis.
Now, to explain the existence of Gunasthanas in the remaining Devas, the Uttar Sutra says
Sodhammisaanaphudi Jaav Uvarim-auvarim Gevajjam Ti Vimaanaavaasiyadevaesu Micchaittthi-SaasanaSamm-aitti AsanjadSamm-aidittithaane Sia Pajjattha Sia Apajjattha. || 98 ||
From Saudharma and Aishana up to the highest Praveyak, the Vimana-dwelling Devas are sometimes adequate and sometimes inadequate in the Mithyadristi, Saasainasam-yagdristi, and Asanyatsamyagdristi Gunasthanas. || 98 ||
Now, to determine the nature of the Samyagmithyadristi Devas, the next Sutra says Samm-aamicchaidithaane Niyama Pajjattha. || 99 || The aforementioned Devas are always adequate in the Samyagmithyadristi Gunasthanas. || 99 || Now, to explain the nature of the Gunasthanas in the remaining Devas, the Uttar Sutra says
Anudisa-Aguttaravijaya-Vaijayanta-Jayanta-Avarajita-Savvatth-asiddhivimaanaavaasiyadeva AsanjadSamm-aittith-aane Sia Pajjattha Sia Apajjattha. || 100 ||
The Devas residing in the nine Anudisas and the five Anuttar Viman-as, namely Vijaya, Vaijayanta, Jayanta, Aparajita, and Sarvarthasiddhi, are sometimes adequate and sometimes inadequate in the Asanyatsamyagdristi Gunasthanas. || 100 ||
Now, to explain the Gunasthanas in relation to Vedamaargnaa, the next Sutra says Vedaan-uvaadena Asthi Ityive-da Purisave-da NaQmayave-da Avagadave-da Chedi. || 101 ||
According to the translation of Vedamaargnaa, there are Strivedi, Purushavedi, Napumsakavedi, and Apagatavedi beings. || 101 ||
"Dovairaatmaanam Param Cha Strinaati Chaadayatiti Stri" - According to this Nirukti, the one who covers herself and others with faults is called a woman. The Veda which is in the form of a woman is called Striveda. Alternatively, the one who desires a man is called a woman. The meaning of Veda is experience

Page #161:
---------------------------
[36] In the six realms, the abode of the living beings is described in the **Chakkhandagama**.
[1, 1, 102] A being who experiences itself as a female is called a **Strivedi**. According to the **nirukti** (etymology), "**Puruguṇeṣu purubhogeṣu ca śete iti puruṣaḥ**" (one who sleeps in excellent qualities and enjoyments is a man). Or, one who desires a woman is called a man, and the being who experiences this is called a **Puruṣavedi**. One who is neither a woman nor a man is called a **napumsaka**. Or, one who desires both a woman and a man is called a **napumsaka**, and the being who experiences this is called a **Napumsakavedi**. Those beings whose suffering arising from the three types of **vedas** has been eradicated are called **Apagatavedi**.

Now, to explain the possible **guṇasthāna** (state of qualities) etc. of beings with **vedas**, the next **sutra** (aphorism) is:

**Itthiveda purisavedā asannimicchāitṭipphahuḍi jāva aṇiyatṭi ti || 102 ||**

Beings with **Striveda** and **Puruṣavedi** are from the **Asannimicchā** (state of non-awareness) **mithyādṛṣṭi** (false belief) to the **Anivṛttikaraṇa** (state of non-return) **guṇasthāna**. || 102 ||

Now, to explain the existence of **Napumsakavedi**, the next **sutra** is:

**Naavansayavedā eindaiapphaḍi jāva aṇiyādi ti || 103 ||**

Beings with **Napumsakavedi** are from the **Ekaindriya** (one-sense) to the **Anivṛttikaraṇa** **guṇasthāna**. || 103 ||

Now, to explain the beings without **vedas**, the next **sutra** is:

**Teṇa paramavagadavedā ceti || 104 ||**

Beyond the **Anivṛttikaraṇa** **guṇasthāna**, all beings are without **vedas**. || 104 ||

Here, the absence of **vedas** beyond the **savad** (conscious) part of the ninth **guṇasthāna** should be understood as the absence of **bhāvasaved** (feeling-vedas), not **dravya-ved** (substance-vedas); because, **dravya-ved** remains even further.

Now, to explain the **vedas** in the **mārgaṇā** (hell beings), the next **sutra** is:

**Neraia cadasu hāṇesu suddha ṇasayavedā || 105 ||**

Hell beings are purely (only) **Napumsakavedi** in all four **guṇasthāna**. || 105 ||

To explain the **vedas** in the **tiryanch** (animal) realm, the next **sutra** is:

**Tirikkhā suddha ṇasagavedā eindaiapphahuḍi jāva caurindia ti || 106 ||**

Animals are purely **Napumsakavedi** from the **Ekaindriya** to the **Caturindriya** (four-sense). || 106 ||

To remove the doubt about how many **vedas** the remaining animals have, the next **sutra** is:

**Tirikkhā tiveda asannimpancindaiyapphahuḍi jāva sanjadāsanjadā ti || 107 ||**

## The Path of Passions (Kashaya Margna)

**[1, 1, 112]**

**[37] From the five-sensed beings (Tiryanch Asangi) to the state of restrained and unrestrained qualities (Gunasthan), all beings are associated with the three Vedas.**

**[107]**

**Now, to explain the specific application of the Vedas in the human realm, the following sutra is stated: "Manussa tiveda micchaitipphudi jav aniyatți tti."**

**[108]**

**Humans, from the state of false belief (Mithyadristi Gunasthan) to the state of non-elimination (Anivritikaran), are associated with all three Vedas.**

**[108]**

**Now, to explain the humans who are devoid of the three Vedas, the following sutra is stated: "Teṇa paramavagadavedā chedi."**

**[109]**

**Humans who are in the state of non-elimination (Anivritikaran) and beyond, are devoid of the Vedas.**

**[109]**

**Now, to explain the specific application of the Vedas in the realm of gods, the following sutra is stated: "Devā chadussu hāṇesu duveda itthivedā purisavedā."**

**[110]**

**Gods, in all four states of existence (Gunasthan), are associated with the female Veda (Striveda) and the male Veda (Purushaveda).**

**[110]**

**There are only four states of existence for gods. Gods from the Saudharma to the Aishana heavens are associated with both the female and male Vedas. From the Sanatkumar and Maheindra kalpas onwards, all gods are associated with the male Veda only.**

**Now, to explain the states of existence (Gunasthan) based on the path of passions (Kashaya Margna), the following sutra is stated: "Kasayaṇuvādeṇa atthi kodhakasaī māṇakasaī māyakasaī lobhakasaī akasaī chedi."**

**[111]**

**Based on the path of passions, there are beings who are passionate about anger (Kodhakasaī), pride (Māṇakasaī), deceit (Māyakasaī), greed (Lobhakasaī), and those who are free from passions (Akasaī).**

**[111]**

**Now, to explain the specific application of the path of passions, the following sutra is stated: "Kodhakasaī māṇakasaī māyakasaī eindaiapphudi jav aniyatți tti."**

**[112]**

**Beings who are passionate about anger, pride, and deceit, exist from the state of one sense (Ekaindriya) to the state of non-elimination (Anivritikaran).**

**[112]**

**It is important to understand that the existence of passions in beings who are in the states of A-purvakaran and beyond, is in the form of latent passions (Avyakt Kashaya). Explicit passions (Vyakta Kashaya) are not possible in these states.**

**Now, to explain the specific form of greed (Lobhakasaī), the following sutra is stated: ...**

Page #163:
---------------------------
##  [38]  The Living Being in the Six Stages

[1, 1, 113]  The living being bound by the passion of greed exists from the one-sense stage to the stage of subtle saṃpārāya-purification. || 113 ||

The final limit of the passion of greed is the subtle saṃpārāya stage. This is because when the other passions cease to arise, the passion of greed does not cease at the same time.

Now, to explain the stages of liberation marked by the passionless living beings, the Uttar-sūtra says:

[1, 1, 114]  The passionless living beings exist in four stages: the stage of subdued passion, the stage of extinguished passion, the stage of the liberated with attachments, and the stage of the liberated without attachments. || 114 ||

Although the substance of passion exists in the stage of subdued passion, the existence of the passionless living beings mentioned there is explained in relation to the absence of the arising of passion.

Now, to explain the living beings through the path of knowledge, the Uttar-sūtra says:

[1, 1, 115]  According to the path of knowledge, there are the following types of living beings: the intellectually ignorant, the scripturally ignorant, the knowledge of differentiation, the knowledge of insight, the scripturally knowledgeable, the clairvoyant, the mind-perceiving, and the omniscient. || 115 ||

Knowledge is that which knows. Or, the result of the soul, which arises from the destruction or pacification of the knowledge-obscuring karma, by which the soul knows, knew, or will know, is called knowledge. This knowledge is of two types: direct and indirect. Of these, indirect knowledge is also of two types: intellectual knowledge and scriptural knowledge. Direct knowledge is of three types: clairvoyance, mind-perception, and omniscience.

Intellectual ignorance is the intellect that arises in relation to poison, instruments, deceit, cages, and bondage, without the instruction of another. Scriptural ignorance is the inappropriate instruction of the scriptures of thieves and violence, etc. The opposite clairvoyant knowledge that is the cause of karma is called the knowledge of differentiation. The understanding of an object through the senses and mind is called the knowledge of insight. There are three hundred and thirty-six types of this knowledge, in relation to the five senses and mind (six), the twelve substances like the many, and the four like grasping, etc. (4412 = 48 for grasping, 641244 = 288 for understanding; 288 + 48 = 336). The knowledge of another object in relation to an object known through intellectual knowledge is called scriptural knowledge. This knowledge arises regularly after intellectual knowledge. Its literal and...

Page #164:
---------------------------
[39
1, 1, 119]
There are two types of knowledge, namely, non-verbal and verbal, or, respectively, word-born and gender-born. Of these, verbal knowledge is the main one. The knowledge whose object is the duration (limit) of substance, space, time, and emotion is called Avadhi-knowledge. Because of the duration (limit) of the object, it is also called "limit-knowledge" in the Paramatma. It has two types, namely, Bhava-pratyaya and Guna-pratyaya. The knowledge of the object that is in the mind of another, which has been contemplated in the past, or which will be contemplated in the future, or which is half-contemplated, is called Manah-paryaya-knowledge. This knowledge is only for the restrained beings within the human realm. The knowledge that knows all the objects of the three worlds simultaneously is called Kevala-knowledge.
Now, to speak specifically about Mati-knowledge and Shruta-knowledge, the Uttar-sutra says:
"Mdi-annaani suda-annaani eindaia-pphudi jaav saasan-samm-aititti." ||116||
The ignorant of Mati and the ignorant of Shruta are from one-sense to the Saasan-samyag-drishti guna-sthana. ||116||
Now, to specifically expound on Vibhang-knowledge, the Uttar-sutra says:
"Vibhang-naanam san-nim-icch-aiti-thinaam va saasan-samm-aiti-thinaam va." ||117||
Vibhang-knowledge is for the beings of the San-ni-mithya-drishti and the Saasan-samyag-drishti. ||117||
Since this Vibhang-knowledge is Bhava-pratyaya, it should be present in both the sufficient and insufficient states. To resolve this doubt, the Uttar-sutra says:
"Paj-jattaanam atthi, ap-aj-jattaanam natthi." ||118||
That Vibhang-knowledge is for the sufficient ones, not for the insufficient ones. ||118||
The meaning is that the Deva and Naraka paryayas with the insufficient state are not the cause of Vibhang-knowledge, but the Deva and Naraka paryayas with the sufficient state are the cause of that Vibhang-knowledge. Therefore, it is not present in them during the insufficient time.
Now, to expound on knowledge in the Samyag-mithya-drishti guna-sthana, the Uttar-sutra says:
"Samm-a-michch-aiti-ththane tin-ni vi naan-aani an-naan-ena miss-aani - a-bhi-ni-bohi-ya-naanam mdi-annaan-ena miss-ayam suda-naanam suda-annaan-ena miss-ayam ohi-naanam vibhang-naan-ena miss-ayam, tin-ni vi naan-aani an-naan-ena [an-naani naan-ena] miss-aani va idi." ||119||
In the Samyag-mithya-drishti guna-sthana, all three types of knowledge are mixed with ignorance - Abhinibodhik-knowledge is mixed with Mati-ignorance, Shruta-knowledge is mixed with Shruta-ignorance, and Avadhi-knowledge is mixed with Vibhang-knowledge. Or, all three types of knowledge are mixed with ignorance [ignorance knowledge]. ||119||

Page #165:
---------------------------
[40] In the six realms, the state of living beings is as follows:

[1, 1, 120] Knowledge is the understanding of a thing as it is, and ignorance is the understanding of it in a way that is contrary to its true nature. Mixed knowledge is a type of knowledge that is neither knowledge nor ignorance.

Now, to explain the limits of the qualities of knowledge, the Uttar Sutra says:

"Aabhinivodhiknaan, Shrutagnan and Avadhignan, these three types of knowledge exist from the state of Asanyata Samyagdrishti to the state of Ksheenakashay-Veetrag-Chhadmasth." || 120 ||

Aabhinivodhiknaan, Shrutagnan and Avadhignan, these three types of knowledge exist from the state of Asanyata Samyagdrishti to the state of Ksheenakashay-Veetrag-Chhadmasth. || 120 ||

Now, to explain the state of the possessor of Manahparyaya knowledge, the Uttar Sutra says:

"Manahparyayavani Pamattasanjadapphudi Jav Ksheenakashay-Cheedrag-Chhadmasth." || 121 ||

Those who possess Manahparyaya knowledge exist from the state of Pramattasanjata to the state of Ksheenakashay-Veetrag-Chhadmasth (the twelfth state). || 121 ||

_Here, the Sutra does not differentiate between the meaning and the meaning-maker, but refers to Manahparyaya knowledge as the possessor of Manahparyaya knowledge. Due to the lack of restraint in the lower states of Deshvirat, etc., these beings do not possess Manahparyaya knowledge._

Now, to explain the states of the possessors of Kevalnaan, the Uttar Sutra says:

"Kevalnaani Tisu Thaanesu Sajogikevali Ajogekevali Siddha Chedi." || 122 ||

Those who possess Kevalnaan exist in three states: Sajogikevali, Ajogekevali and Siddha. || 122 ||

Now, to explain the path of restraint, the Uttar Sutra says:

"Sanjamanuvaadena Asthi Sanjada Samaiyachhedouvatthavan Sudhisanjada Pariharasudhisanjada Suhumasampraiy-Sudhisanjada Jahakhad-Vihar-Sudhisanjada Sanjdasanjada Asanjada Chedi." || 123 ||

According to the explanation of the path of restraint, there are five types of restrained beings: Sanjata, Samayik Shuddhisanjata, Chhedoupasthapanashuddhisanjata, Pariharashuddhisanjata, Sukshmasapraiy-Shuddhisanjata and Yathakyat-Vihar-Shuddhisanjata, as well as Sanjatasanjata and Asanjata beings. || 123 ||

Those who are 'San' (restrained) are those who have attained the right faith and right knowledge and are free from external and internal inflows. The renunciation of all types of Savadyayog, with respect to the Dravyarthic Nay, is called Samayik Shuddhi-Sanjam.

Page #166:
---------------------------
[1, 1, 125] Santparoovanae Sanjammaggana
[41 Here, since the intention is of the Dravyarthic Nay, the remaining types of Sanjam should be understood as included in this.
The breaking of that one vow, i.e., the breaking of the vow by the difference of two, three, etc., is called Chhedopasthapanashuddhisanjam. This Chhedopasthapanashuddhisanjam is dependent on the Paryayarthik Nay.
The purified Sanjat, whose avoidance of violence is the main thing, is called Pariharashuddhisanjat. Especially, the one who has practiced abstinence before, having enjoyed the enjoyments according to his own will for thirty years, both generally and specifically, and whose tapasya has produced an increase in avoidance, such a being takes Pariharashuddhisanjam at the feet of the Tirthankara. The one who takes this Sanjam is able to avoid violence to living beings in all his actions, such as standing, walking, eating, drinking, and sitting.
"Saampray" is the name of a Kshaya. Those whose Kshayas have become subtle are called Sukshmasaampray. Those who are purified Sanjats with subtle Kshayas are called Sukshmasaampray-Shuddhisanjat. This means that when the Sadhus who take Samayik and Chhedopasthapanasanjam make their Kshayas extremely subtle, they are called Sukshmasaampray-Shuddhisanjat.
Those who have the conduct, i.e., the practice of the absence of Kshayas, as described in the Parmagam, are called Yathakyatvihar. Those who are purified Sanjats with Yathakyatvihar are called Yathakyat-Vihar-Shuddhisanjat.
_ Those who are united with the five Anuvrats, three Gunavrats, and four Shikshavrats, and who are engaged in Karma Nirjara, are called Samyagdristi Jivas, Sanjatasanjat. Their Darshanik, Vratik, Samayiki, Proshdhopavaasi, Sachittavirat, Ratribhuktavirat, Brahmachari, Aarambhavirat, Parigrahavirat, Anumativirat, and Uddishtavirat; these are eleven types.
Those Jivas who are not free from the six types of beings and the objects of the senses should be considered Asanjat.
Now, to describe the number of Gunasthanas in Sanjats, the Sutra says - Sanjada Pamattasanjadapphudi Jav Ajohikevali Tti || 124 || Sanjat Jivas are from Pamattasanjat to Ajohikevali Gunasthan. || 124 || Now, to describe the Gunasthanas of Sanjam, the Sutra says - Samaiyachhedoovatthavanashuddhisanjada Pamattasanjadapphudi Jav Aniyatatti Ti || 125 ||
Sanjat Jivas who have attained purity in the form of Samayik and Chhedopasthapan are from Pamattasanjat to Anivrittikaran Gunasthan. || 125 ||

**Six-Part-Scripture** (Chhakkanḍāgame) **Living Beings**
[1, 1, 126]

Now, to describe the **Guṇasthānas** (stages of spiritual development) of **Parihāra-Śuddhi-Samyama** (conduct-purification-self-control), the Uttar-Sūtra says:

**Parihāra-Śuddhi-Samyata** (conduct-purification-self-control) are in two **Guṇasthānas**: **Pramatta-Samyata-Guṇasthāna** (distracted self-control) and **Apramatta-Samyata-Guṇasthāna** (undivided self-control). || 126 ||

Now, to describe the **Guṇasthāna** of **Sūkṣma-Sāmprāyika-Samyata** (subtle-worldly-self-control), the Uttar-Sūtra says:

**Sūkṣma-Sāmprāyika-Śuddhi-Samyata** (subtle-worldly-purification-self-control) are in only one **Guṇasthāna**: **Sūkṣma-Sāmprāyika-Śuddhi-Samyata-Guṇasthāna** (subtle-worldly-purification-self-control). || 127 ||

Now, to describe the **Guṇasthānas** of the fourth **Samyama** (self-control), the Uttar-Sūtra says:

**Yathākhyāta-vihāra-Śuddhi-Samyata** (as-declared-conduct-purification-self-control) are in four **Guṇasthānas**: **Upasāntakaṣāya-Vītarāga-Chhadmastha** (calm-passion-freed-hidden), **Kṣīṇakaṣāya-Vītarāga-Chhadmastha** (diminished-passion-freed-hidden), **Sayogika-Kevali** (joined-liberated), and **Ayogika-Kevali** (unjoined-liberated). || 128 ||

To describe the **Guṇasthāna** of **Samyata-Samyata** (self-controlled-self-control), the Uttar-Sūtra says:

**Samyata-Samyata** (self-controlled-self-control) are in only one **Guṇasthāna**: **Samyata-Samyata-Guṇasthāna** (self-controlled-self-control). || 129 ||

Now, to describe the **Guṇasthānas** of **Asamyata** (uncontrolled), the Uttar-Sūtra says:

**Asamyata** (uncontrolled) are from **Ekaindriya** (one-sense) to **Asamyata-Samyagdṛṣṭi** (uncontrolled-right-vision). || 130 ||

Although some **Mithyādṛṣṭi** (false-vision) beings are seen practicing **Vrata** (vows), they are not truly **Samyata** (self-controlled); because, without **Samyagdṛṣṭi** (right-vision), **Samyama** (self-control) is not possible.

Now, to describe the existence of beings through **Darśana-Mārgaṇā** (path of vision), the Uttar-Sūtra says:

Through **Darśana-Mārgaṇā** (path of vision), there are **Cakṣu-Darśanī** (eye-vision), **Acaksu-Darśanī** (non-eye-vision), **Avidhi-Darśanī** (clairvoyance), and **Kevala-Darśanī** (omniscience). || 131 ||

**Darśana** (vision) is that by which one sees. Or, **Darśana** (vision) is the self-related use connected with the effort that is the cause of the arising of knowledge. It is of four types: **Cakṣu-Darśana** (eye-vision), **Acaksu-Darśana** (non-eye-vision), **Avidhi-Darśana** (clairvoyance), and **Kevala-Darśana** (omniscience). The effort connected with the production of visual knowledge...

Lesyamargna
[43
The perception of the self as "I am able to perceive forms" is called Chakshudarshan. Perception through the remaining four senses and the mind, excluding the eye, is called Achakshudarshan. Perception that occurs before Avadhijnana is called Avhidarshan. Perception that is devoid of opposition is called Kevaldarshan.
Now, to explain the Gunasthanas related to Chakshudarshan, the sutra says - Chakkhudansani Chaurindiya Pahudi Jav Khiinakashaya- Viyaraya- Chadumattha Ti || 132 || Chakshudarshani Jivas are from Chaturindriya to Khinakashaya- Vitraga- Chadmastha Gunasthanas.
Now, to explain the owner of Achakshudarshan, the uttarasutra says - Achakkhudansani Eindiya Pahudi Jav Khiinakashaya- Viyaraya- Chadumattha Tti || 133 || Achakshudarshani Jivas are from Ekendriya to Khinakashaya- Vitraga- Chadmastha Gunasthanas. Now, to explain the Gunasthanas related to Avhidarshan, the uttarasutra says - Odhidansani Asanjad Sammaitthippa Hudi Jav Khiinakashaya- Viyaraga Chadumattha Ti || Avhidarshani Jivas are from Asanjat Samyagdristi to Khinakashaya- Vitraga- Chadmastha Gunasthanas.
|| 134 ||
Now, to explain the owner of Kevaldarshan, the uttarasutra says - Kevalsani Tisu Aane Su Sajogikevali Ajogekevali Siddha Chedi || 135 || Kevaldarshani Jivas are in these three states: Sayogikevali, Ajogekevali, and Siddha. Now, to investigate the Jivas through Lesyamargna, the uttarasutra says - Lessavaade Asthi Kinhalessia Neelalessia Kaulessia Teulessia Pammalessia Sukkalessia Alessia Chedi || 136 ||
According to Lesyamargna, there are Jivas with Krishna Leshya, Neelaleshya, Kapoteleshya, Tejo Leshya, Padmaleshya, and Shuklaleshya, as well as Aleshya. || 136 ||
The tendency of Yogas that is influenced by Kshaya is called Leshya. According to the Nirukti, "Karmaskandhai: Atmanam Limpati Iti Leshya", Leshya is that which stains the soul with Karmaskandhas. This is the Nirukti meaning of the word "Leshya". Here, Kshaya and Yoga, in their mixed state of Jatyantarakrupa, are called Leshya. Therefore, this Margna should be understood separately from Kshaya and Yoga Margna. It is important to note that the tendency of Yoga influenced by Kshaya should not be considered Leshya, because if we accept this, it would imply that Sayogikevali is devoid of Leshya. But this is not the case, because the Agam has stated that Shuklaleshya is present due to the presence of Yoga in Sayogikevali.

##  44] The Six-Fold Abodes of the Soul

[1, 1, 136] There are six types of *kṣaya* (passions) - *tīvratam*, *tīvratar*, *tīvra*, *manda*, *mandatar*, and *mandatam*.  These six types of *kṣaya* give rise to six types of *leśyā* (shades) in a sequential manner: *kṛṣṇaleśyā*, *nīlaleśyā*, *kāpotaleśyā*, *tejoleśyā*, *padmaleśyā*, and *śuklaleśyā*.  The identification of souls associated with these *leśyā* is as follows:

1. A soul who is prone to intense anger, does not let go of hatred, is naturally inclined to fight, is devoid of Dharma and compassion, is wicked, is not under anyone's control, is self-centered, is slow in action, lacks discernment in present actions, is devoid of skill and cunning, is lustful towards the objects of the five senses, is arrogant, deceitful, lazy, and cowardly, should be known as having *kṛṣṇaleśyā*.

2. A soul who is excessively sleepy, is skilled in deceiving others, and has an intense desire for wealth and possessions, should be known as having *nīlaleśyā*.

3. A soul who gets angry at others, criticizes others, causes suffering to others in various ways, blames others, is constantly afflicted by excessive sorrow and fear, cannot tolerate the excellence of others, despises others, praises themselves in various ways, does not trust others, considers others equal to themselves, is satisfied by flattery, does not understand their own and others' loss and gain, desires to die in battle, gives a lot of wealth to flatterers, and does not calculate the right and wrong of actions, should be known as having *kāpotaleśyā*.

4. A soul who understands right and wrong actions, and what should be served and what should not be served, is impartial in all matters, is eager for compassion and charity, and is gentle in thought, speech, and action, should be known as having *pītaleśyā*.

5. A soul who is renunciant, has good consequences, is constantly engaged in action, patiently endures various kinds of painful afflictions, and is devoted to the worship of the virtuous and the gurus, should be known as having *padmaleśyā*.

6. A soul who is impartial, does not create divisions, treats everyone equally, and is free from attachment and aversion towards pleasant and unpleasant objects, should be known as having *śuklaleśyā*.

Souls who have transcended these six *leśyā* are known as *aleśyā* (without *leśyā*).  Now, to explain the characteristics of *leśyā*, the following *sūtra* is recited:

*Kiṇhalessiā ṇīlalessiā kaulalessiā eindaiapphuḍi jāv asanjadassammāitṭi ti.* || 137 ||

[1, 1, 143] Santparoovanae Lessamaggana
[45] The beings with Krishna, Neel and Kapoot Leshya are from Ekendriya to Asanyat Samyagdrishti Gunasthan. || 137 ||
Now, to explain the Gunasthan of Tejo and Padma Leshya, the Uttar Sutra says:
Teulessia Pammalessia Sanni-michchhaitipphudi Jav Appamat-sanjada tti || 138 ||
The beings with Tejo and Padma Leshya are from Sanjee Mithyadrishti to Apramat-sanyat Gunasthan. || 138 ||
Now, the Gunasthan of Shukla Leshya is explained: Sukkalessia Sanni-michchhaitipphudi Jav Sajogikevali tti || 139 || The beings with Shukla Leshya are from Sanjee Mithyadrishti to Sayogikevali Gunasthan. || 139 ||
Here, a doubt may arise: How is Shukla Leshya possible for beings who have become free from Kshaya? The answer is: Since the beings whose Kshaya has become weak or subsided have Yoga, which is the cause of Karma-lep, their Shukla Leshya is considered to be present.
Now, the beings without Leshya are explained: Teṇ Parmalessia || 140 || All beings beyond the 13th Gunasthan are without Leshya. || 140 ||
The reason is that there is absence of both Yoga and Kshaya, which are the causes of Bandha.
Now, to explain the existence of beings through Bhavyamargna, the Sutra says: Bhaviaṇuvadeṇ Asthi Bhavasiddhia Abhavasiddhia || 141 || Through Bhavyamargna, there are Bhavasiddha and Abhavasiddha beings. || 141 ||
The beings who are destined to attain Anant-Chatushtaya-rupa Siddhi in the future are called Bhavasiddha (Bhavy), and those who are devoid of the ability to attain that Anant-Chatushtaya-rupa Siddhi should be considered Abhavy.
Now, the Gunasthan of Bhavy beings are explained: Bhavasiddhia Eindiyapphudi Jav Ajogekevali tti || 142 || Bhavasiddha beings are from Ekendriya to Ajogekevali Gunasthan. || 142 || Now, the Gunasthan of Abhavy beings are explained: Abhavasiddhia Eindiyapphudi Jav Sanni-michchhaiti tti || 143 ||

It is said
In the six-region doctrine, the living beings
[1, 1, 143
From the one-sense being to the cognizant false-view, are in the quality-places. || 143 || Now, to establish the existence of the living beings by the translation of the right-faith path, the sutra says
Samatāṇuvādeṇa asthi sammāṭṭhī khaiyasammāṭṭhī vedagasammāṭṭhī uvasamasammāsāsaṇasammāṭṭhī sammāmicchāṭṭhī micchāṭṭhī chedi || 144 ||
By the translation of the right-faith path, there are right-view, fading right-view, knowing right-view, calming right-view, nourishing right-view, right-false-view, and false-view living beings. || 144 ||
To have faith in the six substances, five aggregates, and nine substances taught by the Jina, by command or by attainment, is called right-faith. Those who have this right-faith are called right-view. When the delusion of perception is completely destroyed, the pure faith in the truth is called fading right-view. Those living beings who have this fading right-view should be understood as fading right-view. The faith in the truth that is unsteady, impure, and deep, arising from the arising of the nature of the right-faith-delusion, is called knowing right-view. Those living beings who have this are called knowing right-view. Just as when pure water is poured into muddy water, the mud settles down and the water becomes clear, in the same way, the pure faith in the truth that arises from the calming of the perception-delusion is called calming right-view. Those living beings who have this should be known as calming right-view. The faith in the truth that is mixed with right-faith and false-faith, arising from the arising of the nature of right-false-faith, should be understood as right-false-faith, and the living being associated with it should be understood as right-false-view. When the calming right-view is present, if the arising of one infinite-bound occurs when there are at least one and at most six āvali-measure periods remaining, the right-faith of that being is destroyed, and it has not attained the false-view state, it is called nourishing right-view. Those living beings whose faith in the truth is becoming opposite due to the arising of false-view should be understood as false-view.
Now, to describe the quality-places of the common right-view and fading right-view,
the sutra says
Sammāṭṭhī khaiyasammāṭṭhī asanjad sammāṭṭi paḍi jāv ajogikevali tti || Right-view and fading right-view living beings are from the unrestrained right-view quality-place to the non-yogic-kevali quality-place. || 145 ||
Now, to describe the quality-places of the knowing right-view, the following sutra says
Ved sammāṭṭhī asanjad sammāṭṭi paḍi jāv appamatasanjadā tti || 146 || Knowing right-view living beings are from the unrestrained right-view to the non-negligent-restrained quality-place. || 146 ||

[47. To expound the Gunasthanas of Aupashamik Samyagdarshan, the Uttar Sutra says:
Uvasamasammaitthi Asanjadassammaitthipphudi Jav Uvasantakasay-Viyarag-Chhadumaththa Tti. || 147 ||
Upasham Samyagdristi Jivas are from Asanyat Samyagdristi Gunasthan to Upashantakashay-Vitrag-Chhadmasth Gunasthan. || 147 ||
Now, to expound the Gunasthan of Sasadan Samyaktva, the Uttar Sutra says: Sasanasammaitthi Ekammen Chey Sasanasammaitthiana. || 148 || Sasadan Samyagdristi Jivas are only in one Sasadan Samyagdristi Gunasthan. || 148 || Now, to indicate the Gunasthan of Samyagmithyatva, the Uttar Sutra says: Sammamicchaittthi Ekammen Chey Sammamicchaittthithane. || 149 || Samyagmithyadristi Jivas are only in one Samyagmithyadristi Gunasthan. || 149 || Now, to expound the Gunasthan related to Mithyatva, the Uttar Sutra says: Micchaittthi Eindiyapphudi Jav SanniMicchaittthi Tti. || 150 || Mithyadristi Jivas are from Ekendriya to Sanjni Mithyadristi. || 150 || Now, to expound Samyagdarshan in the Margnaas, the Uttar Sutra says:
Neraia Asthi Micchaittthi Sasanasammaitthi Sammamicchaittthi Asanjadassammaitthi Tti. || 151 ||
Naraki Jivas are Mithyadristi, Sasadan Samyagdristi, Samyagmithyadristi and Asanyat Samyagdristi. || 151 ||
Now, to expound Samyagdarshan in the seven Prithvis, the Uttar Sutra says: Evam Jav Sattasu Pudhavisu. || 152 || In the same way, there are four Gunasthanas in the beginning of the seven Prithvis. || 152 || Now, to expound the special Samyagdarshan in the Narakis, the Sutra says:
Neradya Asanjadassammaitthithane Aththi Khaiyassammaitthi Vedagasammaitthi Uvasamasammaitthi Chedi. || 153 ||
Naraki Jivas are in the Asanyat Samyagdristi Gunasthan, and they are also Kshayik Samyagdristi, Vedak Samyagdristi and Upasham Samyagdristi. || 153 ||
Now, to explain the different types of Samyagdarshan in the first Prithvi, the Uttar Sutra says:

Page #173:
---------------------------
48
**Jiva Location in the Six Realms**
[1, 1, 154
In the first earth, the hellish beings are endowed with all three right views. || 154 ||
In the same way, the hellish beings in the first earth are endowed with all three right views. || 15 || Now, to explain the right view in the remaining earths, the Uttar Sutra says:
From the second earth to the seventh earth, the hellish beings are not endowed with the Kshayika Samyag Darshan in the Asanjat Samyag Darshan Gunasthan, but they are endowed with the remaining two Samyag Darshan. || 155 ||
Now, to explain the specific characteristics of the Tiryanch Gati, the Sutra says:
The Tiryanch are endowed with Mithya Darshan, Sasadan Samyag Darshan, Samyag Mithya Darshan, Asanjat Samyag Darshan, and Sanjat Sanjat. || 156 ||
Now, to explain the specific characteristics of the Tiryanch in more detail, the Sutra says:
In the same way, it should be understood that all the Tiryanch in the entire islands and seas are endowed with the five Gunasthan. || 157 ||
Although there are countless islands and seas beyond the Manushottar mountain and east of the Khayan Prabhachal in the Swayambhu Ramandeep, where the Tiryanch born there are not endowed with Sanjam and Asanjam, yet it is possible for the Tiryanch who are born in the Karmabhoomi and are brought there by the Devas or Danavas due to their enmity, to have good conduct. It is in this context that the five Gunasthan of the Tiryanch have been mentioned there.
Now, to explain the specific differences in the Samyag Darshan of the Tiryanch, the Sutra says:
The Tiryanch in the Asanjat Samyag Darshan Gunasthan are also endowed with Kshayika Samyag Darshan, Vedak Samyag Darshan, and Uvashma Samyag Darshan. || 158 ||
Now, to explain the specific characteristics of the fifth Gunasthan of the Tiryanch, the Sutra says:
The Tiryanch in the Sanjat Sanjat Gunasthan are not endowed with Kshayika Samyag Darshan, but they are endowed with the remaining two Samyag Darshan. || 159 ||

Page #174:
---------------------------
[1, 1, 163]
Samantparoovanae Sammattamaggnaa
[49
The reason for this is that Kshayika Samyagdrsti beings do not get reborn as Tiryanchas after death. Although beings with previous bound lifespan are born as Tiryanchas, they are born in the Bhoga Bhoomi, not the Karma Bhoomi. And it is not possible for beings born in the Bhoga Bhoomi to develop Desh Samyam. This is the reason why Kshayika Samyagdrsti is not mentioned as the fifth Gunasthan for Tiryanchas.
I
Now, to explain the presence of Samyaktva in specific Tiryanchas, the Uttar Sutra says, "Panchidhiya Tirrikha Panjidhiya - Tirikhhapanjatta." || 160 ||
Similarly, one should understand the order of Samyagdarshan in Panchendriya Tiryanchas and Panchendriya Tiryancha Paryaptas. || 160 ||
Now, to explain specifically in Yoni-mati Tiryanchas, the Uttar Sutra says,
"Panchidhiya Tirrikhajyonini-su Asanjad Sammaittthi-Sanjadasanjadtthaane Khaiyasammaittthi Natthi Avasesa Aththi." || 161 ||
In Yoni-mati Panchendriya Tiryanchas, there are no Asanjat Samyagdrsti and Sanjata-Sanjat Gunasthan with Kshayika Samyagdrsti, the remaining two are present with Samyagdarshan. || 161 ||
The reason for this is that in Yoni-mati Tiryanchas, there is no possibility of the birth of Kshayika Samyagdrsti beings, nor is there any possibility of the destruction of Darshan Mohaniya in them. Therefore, the absence of Kshayika Samyaktva is mentioned in their aforementioned two Gunasthanas.
Now, to explain specifically in humans, the Uttar Sutra says,
"Massa Aththimichchaittthi Sasanasammaittthi Sammamichchaittthi Asanjad Sammaittthi Sanjadasanjad Sanjada Tti." || 162 ||
Humans are Mithyadrsti, Sasadan Samyagdrsti, Samyagmithyadrsti, Asanjat Samyagdrsti, Sanjata-Sanjat and Sanjat. || 162 ||
"Evam Adhhaijad-eev - Samuddesu." || 163 ||
This should be understood in the same way in the two and a half islands and two oceans. || 163 ||
Here, the question arises that even outside the two and a half islands and oceans, why is there no possibility of Sanjata-Sanjat and Sanjat humans being born there if they are brought there by some gods, etc., under the influence of their Baire? The answer is that even with the inspiration of gods, it is not possible for humans to reach beyond the Manushottar Parvat.
6 7
Now, to explain the different types of Samyagdarshan in humans, the Sutra says,
"Manusa Asanjad Sammaittthi-Sanjadasanjad-Sanjadtthaane Aththi Khaiyasammaittthi Vedaya

Page #175:
---------------------------
[50]
Sammatta Uvasamasammattaithi || 164 ||
Humans with Asanyata Samyagdrishti, have Kshayika Samyagdrishti, Vedaka Samyagdrishti and Uvashama Samyagdrishti in the Sayata, Asanyata and Sayata Gunasthanas. || 164 ||
Now, to explain the differences in Samyagdarshan in humans and human females, the sutra says:
Chakkhandagame Jivatthanam
[1, 1, 164
Evam Manusapanjatta Manushini || 165 ||
Similarly, one should know this in humans and human females. || 165 ||
Now, to explain Samyagdarshan in the Deva Gati, the sutra says:
Deva Asthi Micchaittihi Sasanasammattaithi Sammamichchaittihi Asajada Sammaidi Tti || 166 ||
Devas have Mithyadrishti, Sasadan Samyagdrishti, Samyagmithyadrishti and Asanyata Samyagdrishti. || 166 ||
Evam Jav Uvarimouvarimgavej Vimanavasidevati || 167 ||
Similarly, one should know this in the higher and higher Graiveyak Vimanavasi Devas. || 167 ||
Now, to explain the differences in Samyagdarshan in Devas, four more sutras are said:
Deva Asanjadassammattaane Aththi Khaiyasammattaithi Vedayasammattaithi Uvasamasammattaithi || 168 ||

Bhavanavasi, Vanavantar and Jotishi Devas and their Deviyas, as well as the Soudharma and Ishana Kalpavasini Deviyas, all do not have Kshayika Samyagdrishti in the Asanyata Samyagdrishti Gunasthan; they have the remaining two Samyagdarshanas. || 169 ||
The reason for this is that in all these Devas and Deviyas, there is no possibility of the destruction of Darshanamohaniya. And those Jivas who have destroyed Darshanamohaniya in their previous Paryaya, also do not have the possibility of being born in the above mentioned Devas and Deviyas.

[1, 1, 175] Santparuvanaae Sannimaggana
[51 Saudharma and Aishana Kalpas, and from there up to the Aveyakavimana-dwelling gods, there are Kshayika-samyagdristi, Vedaka-samyagdristi, and Upshama-samyagdristi in the Asanyata-samyagdristi Gunasthanas. || 170 ||
The reason for this is that there is a possibility of the birth of all three types of Samyagdristi Jivas in the aforementioned gods, and after being born there, it is also possible to attain Vedaka and Upshamika Samyagdarshans. Therefore, the presence of all three Samyagdarshans has been stated in the aforementioned gods.
Anudis-Anuttara-vijaya-Vaijayanta-Jayanta-Aparajit-Savvatth-siddhi-Vimana-vasiy-deva, in the Asanyata-samyagdristi Gunasthanas, there are Kshayika-samyagdristi, Vedaka-samyagdristi, and Upshama-samyagdristi. || 171 ||
In the nine Anudishas and the five Anuttara-vimanas, namely Vijay, Vaijayanta, Jayanta, Aparajit, and Sarvarth-siddhi, the gods residing there are Kshayika-samyagdristi, Vedaka-samyagdristi, and Upshama-samyagdristi in the Asanyata-samyagdristi Gunasthanas. || 171 ||
Now, to explain the Jivas through the Sanjnimaargna, the Sutra says: Sanniyaanuvaden Asthi Sanni Asanni. || 172 || Through the explanation of Sanjnimaargna, there are Sanjji and Asanjji Jivas. || 172 || Now, to explain the possible Gunasthanas in Sanjji Jivas, the Sutra says: Sanni Micchhaitippahudi Javu Khiinakasaya-Viyaraya-Chhadumaththa Tti. || 173 ||
Sanjji Jivas are from the Mithyadristi Gunasthanas up to the Khiinakasaya-Vitaraaga-Chhadmastha Gunasthanas. || 173 ||
Here, the question arises that since the Kevalis are also Sanjji due to having Manas, why are they not included in the Sutra? The answer is that due to being devoid of Avaranakarma, the Kevalis do not perceive external objects through their Manas. Therefore, they are not included in the Sutra.
Now, to explain the Gunasthanas of Asanjji Jivas, the Sutra says: Asanni.Eindiyapphudi Javu Asannipanchindriya Tti. || 174 || Asanjji Jivas are from Ekaindriya up to Asannipanchindriya. || 174 ||
The meaning is that they only have one Mithyadristi Gunasthanas, and there is no possibility of any other Gunasthanas for them.
Now, to explain the Jivas through the Aharamargna, the Sutra says: Aaharaanuvaden Asthi Aahara Anaahara. || 175 || Through the explanation of Aharamargna, there are Aaharaka and Anaaharaka Jivas. || 175 ||

**Six-Part World**
[1, 1, 176] Now, to explain the possible **guṇasthānas** (stages of spiritual development) in the **āhāramārga** (path of nourishment), the sūtra says:
**āhāre aindriyappahuḍi jāva sajogikevali ti || 176 ||**
Nourished beings range from one-sensed to **sajogikevali** (liberated with karma). || 176 ||
Here, the word **āhara** (nourishment) should be understood as **nokarma āhara** (nourishment without karma), excluding **kavala āhara** (food), **lepa āhara** (touch), **ūṣmā āhara** (heat), **mānasika āhara** (mental nourishment), and **karma āhara** (karmic nourishment), as these are not possible in this context.

Now, to explain the possible **guṇasthānas** of the **anāhārakas** (non-nourished beings), the sūtra says:
**aṇāhāre cadasu hāṇesu viggahagāisamāvaṇṇāṇam kevalīṇam vā samugdhādagadāṇam ajogikevali siddhā ceti || 177 ||**
**Vigrahagati** (degeneration) with **mithyātva** (false belief), **sāsādana** (attachment), and **avirat-savyag-dṛṣṭi** (uninterrupted wrong perception), **samuddhāta** (elevation) with **sajogikevali** (liberated with karma), these four **guṇasthānas**, as well as **ajogikevali** (liberated without karma) and **siddha** (perfected beings) are **anāhārakas** (non-nourished). || 177 ||
These beings do not consume **pudgalas** (matter) suitable for the body, hence they are called **anāhārakas** (non-nourished). || 177 ||

## 2. Dravyapamanaanugamo

Now, to explain the number of jivas in the aforementioned fourteen gunasthanas, the Uttar Sutra says:

**Dravyapamanaanugamen duviho niddeso ogheṇa ādesena ya || 1 ||**

There are two types of directions in relation to dravyapamanaanugamo: Oghaniddesha and Aadeshaniddesha. || 1 ||

That which is attained, will be attained, and has been attained is called dravya. Or, that by which the paryayas are attained, will be attained, and were attained is called dravya. This dravya is of two types: jivadravy and ajivadravy.

That which is devoid of five types of colors, five types of tastes, two types of smells, and eight types of touches; is subtle and has countless regions, and whose form is not perceptible to the senses is called jiva. This is the general characteristic of jiva, as it is also found in other intangible dravyas like dharma, etc.

Urdhvagatikhabhava, bhoktṛtva, and sva-paraprakashatva are the unique characteristics of the said jiva; because, this characteristic is not found in any other dravya except jivadravy.

That which does not possess the quality of consciousness is called ajiv. It is of five types: dharma, adharma, akasha, pudgala, and kala. Generally, there are two divisions of ajiv: rupa and arupa. Among them, the pudgala, which is endowed with form, taste, smell, and touch, is the rupa ajivadravy. This rupa ajivadravy is of six types, differentiated as earth, water, shadow, etc. The arupa ajivadravy is of four types: dharmadravya, adharmadravya, akashadravya, and kaladravya. Among them, that which is the cause of the movement and stillness of jivas and pudgalas is dharmadravya, and that which is the cause of their state is adharmadravya. Both these dravyas are intangible and have countless regions, being equal to the loka. That which is all-pervasive and provides space for other dravyas is called akashadravya. That which is the cause of the transformation of itself and other dravyas and is one-regioned is called kaladravya. There are as many kalānus as there are regions in the lokakasha. There are two divisions of akasha: lokakasha and alokakasha. Where the other five dravyas reside is called lokakasha. And where those five dravyas are not found is called alokakasha.

Here, only jivadravy is being discussed, not the other five dravyas.

That by which substances are measured or counted is called pramana. The pramana of dravya is called dravyapramana. Knowledge that is in accordance with the object is called anugamo. Or,

Page #179:
---------------------------
## Chapter 54:

**[1, 2, 2]**

The knowledge that is consistent with the tradition of the Kevalis and Shruta Kevalis is called Anugam. The Anugam of Dravya Praman is called Dravya Praman Anugam.

There are two types of directions in this Dravya Praman Anugam: Oghnirdesh and Adeshnirdesh. To describe the Praman of the Jivas with respect to the fourteen Gunasthanas, without considering the differences in motion and other paths, is called Oghnirdesh. To describe the same fourteen Gunasthanas, taking into account the differences in motion and other paths, is called Adeshnirdesh.

Now, to describe the Oghnirdesh, the Acharya says the following Sutra:

**Oghena Micchaitti Davapamaanaena Kevadia? Ananta. || 2 ||**

How many are the Jivas with Mithyadrishti, with respect to Dravya Praman? They are infinite. || 2 ||

The word "Ananta" in the Sutra indicates that the number of Jivas with Mithyadrishti is infinite. A number that never ends, even after subtracting one digit at a time, is called infinite. Or, the number that is the subject of only one Kevalgyan should be considered infinite.

There are eleven types of Ananta: Namaananta, Sthapanananta, Dravyananta, Shashvatananta, Ganananta, Apradeshananta, Ekananta, Ubhayananta, Vistarananta, Sarvananta, and Bhavananta. Here, Ganananta is being discussed.

This Ganananta is of three types: Paritananta, Yuktananta, and Anantananta. Here, the third type, Anantananta, is being considered.

The Sutra means that the number of Jivas with Mithyadrishti is Anantananta with respect to this Ananta.

There might be a doubt: How can Anantananta be understood from the general instruction "Ananta" used in the Sutra?

The answer is: It is known from the following Sutra (3) that the number of Jivas with Mithyadrishti is Anantananta, because they are not exhausted by the infinite number of Avasarpini and Utsarpini, with respect to time.

This Anantananta is also of three types: Jghanya Anantananta, Utkrishta Anantananta, and Madhyama Anantananta. Here, Madhyama Anantananta should be considered, because it is said in the Parikarma that "wherever Anantananta is seen, there the Madhyama Anantananta is considered."

To describe the Praman of Jivas with Mithyadrishti with respect to time, the Sutra says:

**Atanatahi Osappini Ussappinihi Na Avahiranti Kaalena. || 3 ||**

The number of Jivas with Mithyadrishti is not exhausted by the infinite number of Avasarpini and Utsarpini, with respect to time. || 3 ||

Although the description of Kshetra Praman should have been done before the description of Kala Praman, it is not done here because Kshetra Praman is more specific and Kala Praman is less specific. Therefore, instead of describing Kshetra Praman first, Kala Praman is described here.

Page #180:
---------------------------
[1, 2, 6]
The principle of the number of dravyas is explained. The meaning of the above sutra is that on the one hand, the number of infinite infinite periods of decline and ascent should be established, and on the other hand, the number of all the mithyadrishti jivas should be established. Then, one period should be subtracted from the number of periods, and one mithyadrishti jiva should be subtracted from the number of mithyadrishti jivas. In this way, if we continue to subtract, all the periods of time will be exhausted, but the number of mithyadrishti jivas will not be exhausted. The implication is that there are more mithyadrishti jivas than there are periods of past time.
The number of mithyadrishti jivas is infinite infinite lokas in comparison to the kshetra. || 4 ||
Just as wheat, rice, etc. are measured by a prastha (a type of measure) in the field, so also the number of mithyadrishti jivas is measured by the lokas by means of buddhi, and it is equal to infinite lokas. The implication is that one loka is formed by placing one mithyadrishti jiva on each part of the loka. In this way, if we continue to measure, the number of mithyadrishti jivas is equal to infinite lokas. Here, the loka refers to the cube of the jagashreni. This jagashreni is equal to the length of seven raju-sized regions of space. The middle extent of the tiryanchloka (middle loka) should be considered as one raju here.
Now, we will explain the number of mithyadrishti jivas in comparison to the number of bhavas.
I have also attained the knowledge of the number of bhavas. || 5 ||
The implication is that each of the five types of knowledge, namely, matijnana, etc., is of three types, namely, dravya, kshetra, and kala. Of these three, the knowledge of the existence of dravyas should be understood as dravyabhavapraman, the knowledge of the dravya specific to the kshetra should be understood as kshetrabhavapraman, and the knowledge of the dravya specific to the kala should be understood as kalabhavapraman.
Now, in order to explain the number of dravyas of the jivas from the sasadan to the sanjatasanjat gunasthan, the next sutra says:
How many are the jivas residing in each gunasthan from the sasadansamyagdristi gunasthan to the sanjatasanjat gunasthan in terms of the number of dravyas? They are only an innumerable part of the palyopama. By them, the palyopama is taken away from the antarmukhurta. || 6 ||
The implication is that the amount obtained by dividing the antarmukhurta by the palyopama is the number of sasadan

Page #181:
---------------------------
[56] In the Sixfold Doctrine, the number of living beings

[1, 2, 7 etc. The above four types of beings in the four stages of existence have a specific number in each stage.
For example, imagine that the number of beings in the four stages of existence, starting with the Sasadan Samyagdrishti, is 65,536, and the number of Avaharkala is 32. In this way, dividing the number of Avaharkala, which is 32, by the number of Palyopam, which is 65,536, we get the number of beings in the four stages of existence, starting with the Sasadan Samyagdrishti, as 2048, which is an infinitesimal fraction of the Palyopam. This is just an example from the perspective of numerical calculation. The actual representation should also be understood in the same way. In this example, although the number of beings in all four stages appears to be the same (2048), due to the many differences in the Avaharkala, which is the internal moment, the number of beings should be understood as being more or less from the perspective of meaning. This is because the number of Avaharkala, which is the divisor used to determine the number of beings in the four stages of existence, starting with the Sasadan Samyagdrishti, is of many types. For example:
_ The time taken by one atom to touch another atom while moving slowly is called time. There are countless numbers of such times. A group of countless numbers of times is called an Ucchvas. Seven Ucchvas make a Stoka. Seven Stokas make a Lava. Thirty-eight and a half Lavas make a Nali. Two Nalis make a Muhurta. Above the Avali, there are many types of time, such as one time, two times, and three times, which increase progressively until the Muhurta time, with one time less in each case. All these types of time are included in the Avaharkala. In this way, due to the many types of Avaharkala, the number of Avaharkala for the Sasadan Samyagdrishti can be considered as 32, the number of Avaharkala for the Samyagmithyadrishti can be considered as 16, the number of Avaharkala for the Asanyata Samyagdrishti can be considered as 4, and the number of Avaharkala for the Sanjata Sanjata can be considered as 128. Accordingly, dividing these divisors by the number of Palyopam, which is 65,536, we get the number of Sasadan Samyagdrishti beings as 2048, the number of Samyagmithyadrishti beings as 4096, the number of Asanyata Samyagdrishti beings as 16384, and the number of Sanjata Sanjata beings as 512.
Now, to determine the number of Pramatta Sanjata beings, the Uttar Sutra says, "Prammatta Sanjada Daya Pramaneṇa Kevaḍiya? Koḍiputa." [7] How many are the Prammatta Sanjata beings in terms of their number? Kotiprithaktva Pramana. [7]
Here, the number should be taken as greater than three (3) and less than nine (9). According to the teachings of the Paramguru, the number of Prammatta Sanjata beings is 59,398,206.
Now, to determine the number of Aprammatta Sanjata beings, the Uttar Sutra says,

Page #182:
---------------------------
[1, 2, 10] The number of *dravya* in relation to the *ogha*
[57] How many are the *dravya* in relation to the non-negligent *sanjatas*? Count them. || 8 ||
Although the word "count" appears in the sutra, it should be understood as referring to a number below the *koti* (a very large number). This is because the intended meaning here is not the *koti* but a number below it. If the *koti* were the intended meaning, there would be no need for this sutra separate from the previous one. Secondly, it is also known from the sutra "The time of the non-negligent *sanjatas* is less than the time of the negligent *sanjatas* by a number of times," that the *koti* is not the intended meaning here.
Now, two subsequent sutras are obtained to explain the number of *dravya* in the four *upasamakas*.
How many are the *dravya* in relation to the *upasamaka* *jivas* of the four *gunasthanas*? One, or two, or three, or four in the best case. || 9 ||
In each *gunasthan* of the *upasama* series, one *jiva* enters from the lowest level, and four *jivas* enter in the best case, while simultaneously subduing the *charitramohaniya* (the obscurations of conduct). This is a general statement. In the specific case, there are eight times within the period of a year, which are suitable for the *upasama* series. In the first time, starting with one *jiva*, sixteen *jivas* ascend to the *upasama* series in the best case. In the second time, starting with one *jiva*, twenty-four *jivas* ascend to the *upasama* series in the best case. In the third time, starting with one *jiva*, thirty *jivas* ascend to the *upasama* series in the best case. In the fourth time, starting with one *jiva*, thirty-six *jivas* ascend to the *upasama* series in the best case. In the fifth time, starting with one *jiva*, forty-two *jivas* ascend to the *upasama* series in the best case. In the sixth time, starting with one *jiva*, forty-eight *jivas* ascend to the *upasama* series in the best case. In the seventh and eighth times, starting with one *jiva* in each time, fifty-four *jivas* ascend to the *upasama* series in the best case.
Now, the number of these *upasamaka* *jivas* is counted in relation to time. They are counted in the *upasama* series. || 10 ||
When all the *jivas* accumulated in each *gunasthan* of the *upasama* series within the aforementioned eight times are collected, their number is three hundred and four (16+24+30+36+42+48+54+54=304).

Page #183:
---------------------------
[58] In the six-fold division of the universe, the number of living beings:

[1, 2, 11] To determine the number of living beings in the four stages of liberation and the non-liberated Kevalis, two sutras are obtained:

_ "How many are the four stages of liberation and the non-liberated Kevalis in terms of their substance? One, two, or three at the beginning, and one hundred and eight at the end." [11]

There are eight periods within six months that are suitable for the liberation stages. Without specifying the details of these periods, but considering them generally, it is stated that one living being attains the liberation stage at the lowest level, and one hundred and eight living beings attain the liberation stage at the highest level. Considering the details, in the first period, starting with one living being, thirty-two living beings ascend to the liberation stage. In the second period, starting with one living being, forty-eight living beings ascend to the liberation stage. In the third period, starting with one living being, sixty living beings ascend to the liberation stage. In the fourth period, starting with one living being, seventy-two living beings ascend to the liberation stage. In the fifth period, starting with one living being, eighty-four living beings ascend to the liberation stage. In the sixth period, starting with one living being, ninety-six living beings ascend to the liberation stage. In the seventh and eighth periods, starting with one living being in each period, one hundred and eight living beings ascend to the liberation stage.

Now, their number in terms of time is stated: "Half of them are accumulated." [12] In terms of time, the accumulated number of liberated living beings is half. [12]

Adding all the living beings accumulated in the aforementioned eight periods, they total six hundred and eight (32+48+60+72+84+96+108+108=608) at the highest level.

Now, the number of living beings in the thirteenth stage of liberation is determined:

"How many are the liberated Kevalis in terms of their substance? One, two, or three at the beginning, and one hundred and eight at the end." [13]

Now, their number in terms of accumulation is stated: "Half of them are accumulated, and they are one thousand and six hundred." [14]

---------------------------
[1, 2, 16] The number of dravyas in hell is determined by the number of gatis.
[59 The number of liberated souls (Jinas) is determined by the time period (kalaka) and is called laksha-prthaktva. According to one view, their number is 898502, and according to another view, it is 529648. || 14 ||
The number of liberated souls (Jinas) is determined by the time period (kalaka) and is called laksha-prthaktva. According to one view, their number is 898502, and according to another view, it is 529648.
Now, after determining the number of dravyas in relation to the fourteen gunasthana, we will determine the number of dravyas in hell in relation to the gatis.
According to the order of the gati-anuvada, how many mithyadristi jivas are there in hell in terms of dravya-pramana? They are countless. || 15 ||
According to the order of the gati-anuvada, how many mithyadristi jivas are there in hell in terms of dravya-pramana? They are countless. || 15 ||
This countless number is of eleven types: name, establishment, dravya, eternal, calculation, non-spatial, one, both, expansion, all, and state. Of these, we should consider the calculation-countless. This calculation-countless is also of three types: parita-sankhyata, yukta-sankhyata, and asankhyata-sankhyata. Each of these is also of three types: excellent, medium, and inferior. In this context, we should consider the medium asankhyata-sankhyata. The reason is that the Parikarma Sutra states, "Wherever asankhyata-sankhyata is seen, there the medium asankhyata-sankhyata is considered." This means that the number of mithyadristi jivas in hell in terms of dravya-pramana is medium asankhyata-sankhyata.
Now, we will determine the number of mithyadristi jivas in hell in relation to time.
Countless countless jivas are carried away by the descending and ascending time periods. || 16 ||
Countless countless jivas are carried away by the descending and ascending time periods. || 16 ||
We should place the countless countless descending and ascending time periods on one side and the countless mithyadristi jivas on the other side. Then, we should subtract one time period from the time period side and one jiva from the jiva side. In this way, by repeatedly subtracting one from each side, both the time period side and the jiva side will be exhausted simultaneously. Alternatively, the descending and ascending time periods together constitute one kalpa. Dividing the number of mithyadristi jivas by the kalpa, we get the number of kalpas in which the mithyadristi jivas exist.
Now, we will determine the number of mithyadristi jivas in relation to space.

[60]
In the six realms, the number of living beings is as follows:

[1, 2, 17] In the 17 fields, the number of living beings is countless, and the number of worlds is also countless. The diameter of these worlds is equal to the square root of the first square root of an angula multiplied by the second square root of an angula. [17]

The number of hellish beings with false vision, in comparison to the number of ordinary hellish beings, is countless. The number of worlds in which they reside is also countless. The diameter of these worlds is equal to the square root of the first square root of an angula multiplied by the second square root of an angula. [17]

Now, to explain the number of hellish beings with false vision, right vision, and other types of beings, the following sutra is given:

From the state of the Sasadan Samyagdrishti to the state of the Asanjad Samyagdrishti, how many hellish beings are there in each state, in comparison to the number of dravya? They are countless, like the number of states. [18]

Now, to explain the number of hellish beings in the first earth, the following sutra is given:

In the first earth, the number of hellish beings is equal to the number of ordinary hellish beings. [19]

Now, to explain the number of hellish beings in the second and subsequent earths, the following sutra is given:

From the second earth to the seventh earth, how many hellish beings with false vision are there, in comparison to the number of dravya? They are countless. [20]

Now, to explain the number of hellish beings in comparison to time, the following sutra is given:

From the second earth to the seventh earth, the number of hellish beings with false vision in each earth is countless, and they are carried away by countless avasarpini and utsarpini periods. [21]

This sutra should be understood in the same way as the sutra that explains the number of ordinary hellish beings with false vision.

Now, to explain the number of hellish beings in comparison to both dravya and time, the following sutra is given:

Page #186:
---------------------------
[1, 2, 27]
The number of Naraka Mithyadristi Jivas in each of the six realms, starting from the second, is an infinitesimal fraction of the Jagashreni, in proportion to the size of the realm. The extent of that Jagashreni, which is an infinitesimal fraction, is an immeasurable number of Yojanas, which is equal to the product of the square roots of the number of Jivas in the first and subsequent realms. || 22 ||

Now, to describe the Dravya Pramana of the Sasadan and other Gunasthanas in the remaining realms, starting from the second, the following Sutra is stated:
From Sasadan Samyagdristi Gunasthan to Asanjat Samyagdristi Gunasthan, each Gunasthan is an infinitesimal fraction of the Naraka Jivas in each of the six realms, starting from the second, in proportion to the general form of the Naraka Jivas. || 23 ||

Now, to describe the form of the Tiryanch Mithyadristi and other Jivas in the Tiryanch Gati, the following Sutra is stated:
In the Tiryanch Gati, from Tiryanch Mithyadristi to Sanjatasanjat Gunasthan, the Tiryanch are similar to the general form of the Tiryanch. || 24 ||

Now, to describe the Dravya Pramana of the Panchendriya Tiryanch Mithyadristi, the following Sutra is stated:
How many are the Panchendriya Tiryanch Mithyadristi Jivas in terms of Dravya Pramana? They are innumerable. || 25 || Now, to describe their Pramana in terms of time, the following is stated:
In terms of time, the Panchendriya Tiryanch Mithyadristi Jivas are carried away by innumerable Avasarpini and Utsarpini. || 26 ||

The meaning is that the number of Panchendriya Tiryanch Mithyadristi Jivas is greater than the number of Avasarpini and Utsarpini periods.

Now, to describe the Pramana of the Panchendriya Tiryanch Mithyadristi Jivas in terms of the realm, the following is stated:
In terms of the realm, the Panchendriya Tiryanch Mithyadristi are carried away by the Deva Avahara Kala, which is...

## Chapter 62: The Location of Living Beings in the Six Realms

**[1, 2, 27]**

**27.** Due to the time of the devās' absorption, the number of five-sensed, false-sighted, transmigratory beings is diminished by an innumerable number of times.

**28.** From the Sasadan Samyagdarshi (Perfect Seer) Gunasthan to the Sanjata Sanjata Gunasthan, the number of five-sensed, transmigratory beings in each Gunasthan is an innumerable fraction of the number of ordinary transmigratory beings.

**29.** How many five-sensed, transmigratory beings are there who are fully false-sighted? They are innumerable.

**30.** In terms of time, the number of five-sensed, transmigratory beings who are fully false-sighted is diminished by an innumerable number of times by the Avasarpini (descending) and Utsarpini (ascending) periods.

**31.** In terms of space, the number of five-sensed, transmigratory beings who are fully false-sighted is diminished by a number of times less than the time of the devās' absorption.

**32.** From the Sasadan Samyagdarshi Gunasthan to the Sanjata Sanjata Gunasthan, the number of five-sensed, transmigratory beings who are fully false-sighted in each Gunasthan is an innumerable fraction of the number of beings in the stream of transmigration.

The next three sutras will explain the number of five-sensed, transmigratory beings with yonimati (having a body) in terms of substance, time, and space.

In terms of the field, they are taken away from the world by the avasarpini and utsarpini, from the time of the devās' avahara, by a number of times equal to the number of the five-sensed, non-human beings who are mithyātva.  [35]
Now, the amount of the five-sensed, non-human beings who are sāsadana-samyagdṛṣṭi, etc., is described.
From the sāsadana-samyagdṛṣṭi to the saṃyata-saṃyata, in each of the guṇasthāna, the five-sensed, non-human beings are a countless part of the ordinary non-human beings.

## Six Divisions of the World (Chhakkanḍāga)

[1, 2, 41]

**How many are the Mithyādṛṣṭi (false-believing) beings among the humans who have attained the human state, in terms of the number of Dravyas (substances)?** They are countless. They are carried away by the countless, immeasurable, and innumerable Asarpini (descending) and Utsarpini (ascending) times. [41]

**In terms of time, the countless Mithyādṛṣṭi beings among humans are carried away by the countless Asarpini and Utsarpini times.** [41]

[64]

**In terms of the field, the number of Mithyādṛṣṭi beings among humans is a countless part of the Jagashreṇi (world-series).** The extent of that series is countless crores of yojanas. **Multiplying the square root of the first square of the Sucyangula (needle-finger) by its third square root, and establishing the result in the form of a line, the Jagashreṇi is carried away by the number of Mithyādṛṣṭi beings that is greater than the number of beings in thirteen places, including the one that is added to the line.** [42]

**Now, to determine the number of humans in the remaining places, the next two sutras are obtained.**

**From the Sāsādanasamyakdṛṣṭi (perfect-believing) place to the Sanjatāsanjata (controlled-controlled) place, how many are the humans in terms of the number of Dravyas?** They are countable. [43]

**This sutra means that from the Sāsādanasamyakdṛṣṭi place to the Sanjatāsanjata place, the number of humans in each place is countable.** In general, it is said that the number of humans in each of these four places is countable, but their specific number is as follows: There are fifty-two crores (52,000,000) Sāsādanasamyakdṛṣṭi humans, twice the number of Sāsādanasamyakdṛṣṭi humans are Samyakmithyādṛṣṭi (right-false-believing) humans, seven hundred crores are Asanjatasamyakdṛṣṭi (uncontrolled-perfect-believing) humans, and thirteen crores are Sanjatāsanjata humans. Some Ācāryas state that the number of Sāsādanasamyakdṛṣṭi humans is fifty crores, and the number of Samyakmithyādṛṣṭi humans is twice that.

**From the Pramattasanjata (careless-controlled) place to the Ayogikevali (non-yogic-liberated) place, the number of humans in each place is the same as the general description.** [44]

**Since the humans in the Pramattasanjatādi places are not possible in any other state except the human state, therefore, the number of Pramattasanjatādi beings among humans should be considered the same as the general description.**

Page #190:
---------------------------
[1, 2, 51]  The number of dravyas (substances) according to the guna-sthana (stages of spiritual progress)
[65] Now, the number of dravyas is described based on the guna-sthana in the case of human beings.
How many are the mithyatva-dristi (false-believers) human beings in terms of dravya-pramana (number of substances)? They are countless above countless and countless below countless, above the sixth and below the seventh guna-sthana. || 45 ||
How many are the sasadan-samyag-dristi (right-believers) human beings from the sasadan-samyag-dristi guna-sthana to the sanjata-sanjata guna-sthana in terms of dravya-pramana? They are countless. || 46 ||
From the pramatta-sanjata guna-sthana to the ayogika-kevali guna-sthana, the number of human beings in each guna-sthana is the same as the general description. || 47 ||
Now, the number of dravyas in the case of women is described.
How many are the mithyatva-dristi women in terms of dravya-pramana? They are countless above countless and countless below countless, above the sixth and below the seventh guna-sthana. || 48 ||
How many are the sasadan-samyag-dristi women from the sasadan-samyag-dristi guna-sthana to the ayogika-kevali guna-sthana in terms of dravya-pramana? They are countless. || 49 ||
Now, to describe the number of attainable human beings, the Uttar-sutra says:
How many are the attainable human beings in terms of dravya-pramana? They are countless. || 50 ||
The number of unattainable human beings is countless, this is generally stated here. To describe that countless specifically, the Uttar-sutra says:
They are countless, countless, and they are constantly increasing and decreasing in time. || 51 ||

Page #191:
---------------------------
[66] In the Cakkhanḍagaṁ, the number of living beings
[1, 2, 51] In terms of time, the number of Mithyādr̥ṣṭi Devas is countless, being taken away by countless descending and ascending cycles. || 51 ||
The extent of the field is countless divisions of a ladder. The length of that ladder is countless koṭis of yojanas. The field is taken away by the number of humans who are not worthy of liberation, multiplied by the square root of the third root of an angula, and then by the square root of that root. || 52 ||
In terms of the field, the number of humans who are worthy of liberation is a countless fraction of the Jagashreṇi. The extent of that fraction of the Jagashreṇi is countless koṭis of yojanas. The Jagashreṇi is taken away by the number of humans who are worthy of liberation, multiplied by the square root of the third root of an angula, and then by the square root of that root. || 52 ||
By multiplying the square root of the first root of an angula by the square root of the third root of an angula, and then dividing the Jagashreṇi by that product, and then subtracting one from the quotient, we get the number of ordinary humans. By subtracting the number of humans who are worthy of liberation from this, we get the number of humans who are worthy of liberation.
Now, we will describe the number of living beings in the Deva-gati, starting with the number of Mithyādr̥ṣṭi Devas.
In the Deva-gati, how many Devas are there in terms of the number of Mithyādr̥ṣṭi Devas? Countless. || 53 ||
A number that ends when we subtract one from it repeatedly is called countless, and a number that does not end in this way is called infinite. Alternatively, a number that is the object of the five senses is called countable, a number beyond that which is the object of Avadhi-jñāna is called countless, and a number beyond that which is the object of only Kevala-jñāna is called infinite.
Countless countless Mithyādr̥ṣṭi Devas are taken away by descending and ascending cycles in terms of time. || 54 ||
In terms of the field, the number of Mithyādr̥ṣṭi Devas is obtained by dividing the Jagapratara by the square of two hundred and fifty-six angulas. || 55 ||
The meaning is that we should know the number of Devas in terms of the field by dividing the Jagapratara by the square of two hundred and fifty-six angulas.
The stream of those who are not worthy of liberation, who are not properly guided, and who have not attained right faith, is the stream of those who are properly guided and have attained right faith. || 56 ||

**How many are the mithya-drusti jivas in the Bhavan-vasi dev's dravya-paman? They are innumerable.** || 57 ||
**Innumerable-innumerable are the Bhavan-vasi mithya-drusti dev's who are carried away by the innumerable-innumerable avsarpinis and utsarpinis in time.** || 58 ||
**In terms of the kshetra, the Bhavan-vasi mithya-drusti dev's are innumerable jag-shreni in number, which are innumerable parts of the jag-pratar.** **The diameter of those innumerable jag-shreni is equal to the product of the angul and the square root of the angul.** || 59 ||

**The meaning is that the number of Vanavayantar mithya-drusti dev's is equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the jag-pratar by the number of hundred yojanas squared.**
**Saas-samyag-drusti, samyag-mithya-drusti and asanjat-samyag-drusti are like the innumerable parts of the general flow of the Vanavayantar dev's.** || 64 ||
**The dev-gana of the Joisiya-dev's are destroyed.** || 65 ||

[68] In the six-fold division of the universe, the number of Jyotishi Devas is equal to the number of ordinary Devas mentioned in [1, 2, 65]. [65]
The Sutra states that the number of Jyotishi Devas, excluding those with Mithyadrishti and other Gunasthanas, is equal to the number of ordinary Devas. This should be understood as a general representation. The number of Jyotishi Devas mentioned here is a general representation. In reality, the number of Jyotishi Devas is equal to the square of 256 angulas divided by the Jagapratara. The number of ordinary Devas is slightly more than this.
How many Mithyadrishti Jivas are there in the Saudharma and Aishana Kalpavasis? They are countless. [66]
The countless Mithyadrishti Devas in the Saudharma and Aishana Kalpas are carried away by the countless Avasarpini and Utsarpini periods. [67]
In terms of the field, the number of Mithyadrishti Devas in the Saudharma and Aishana Kalpas is countless Jagashreni. The measure of those countless Jagashreni is the countless part of the Jagapratara. Their diameter is equal to the square root of the second square of the angula multiplied by its third square root. [68]
The Saudharma-Aishana Kalpavasis, those with Sasadan Samyagdristi, Samyagmithyadristi, and Asanjat Samyagdristi, are countless parts of the Paliopama, similar to the general representation. [69]
Just as the number of Narakas in the seventh earth is represented, so is the number of Mithyadrishti Devas in the Kalpavasis from Sanatkumar to Shatar and Sahasrar. [70]
How many Mithyadrishti, Samyagmithyadristi, and Asanjat Samyagdristi are there in the Anada-Panada to the Navagevejjavimana Kalpavasis? They are countless parts of the Paliopama. These Paliopama are carried away by the Antomuhurta. [71]

---------------------------
[1, 2, 77] How many are the **Vimana**-dwelling gods from the **Mithyadrishti** **Gunasthan** to the **Asanyata Samyagdristi** **Gunasthan**, in relation to the **Dravyapamana**? They are countless parts of a **Palyopam**. The **Palyopam** is taken away by the above-mentioned living beings from the **Antarmuhurta** to the **Palyopam**. || 71 ||

How many are the **Asanyata Samyagdristi** gods dwelling in the **Vimana** from **Anudish** to **Aparajit**, in relation to the **Dravyapamana**? They are countless parts of a **Palyopam**. The **Palyopam** is taken away by these living beings from the **Antarmuhurta**. || 72 ||

How many are the **Sarvarthasiddhi** **Vimana**-dwelling gods in relation to the **Dravyapamana**? They are countable. || 73 ||

The **Sarvarthasiddhi** **Vimana**-dwelling gods are three times the number of human beings. This should be understood here.

Now, the number of **Ekaindriya** beings is explained by the **Indriyamargna**.

How many are the **Ekaindriya**, **Ekaindriya Paryapta**, **Ekaindriya Aparyapta**, **Badar Ekaindriya**, **Badar Ekaindriya Paryapta**, **Badar Ekaindriya Aparyapta**, **Sookshma Ekaindriya**, **Sookshma Ekaindriya Paryapta**, and **Sookshma Ekaindriya Aparyapta** beings in relation to the **Dravyapamana**, according to the **Indriyamargna**? They are infinite. || 74 ||

These nine living beings, starting with **Ekaindriya**, are not taken away by the infinite infinite **Avasarpini** and **Utsarpini** in relation to time. || 75 ||

If we consider the past time in relation to the **Avasarpini** and **Utsarpini**, then the infinite **Avasarpini** and **Utsarpini** are the measure of the past time. These nine beings are not taken away by that past time. In other words, the number of **Badar Ekaindriya** etc. beings mentioned in the sutras is much greater than the number of times in the past time.

These nine living beings, starting with **Ekaindriya**, are infinite infinite **Loka** in relation to the **Kshetra**. || 76 ||

**Beindriya**, **Teindriya**, **Chaurindriya**, and the same **Paryapta** and **Aparyapta** in relation to the **Dravyapamana**...

From the Saasadan Samyagdristi Gunasthan to the Ayogikevali Gunasthan, each Gunasthan-dwelling five-sensed and five-sensed perfect being is an innumerableth part of the common form, like a moment. Now, we will describe the measure of the attainable perfect five-sensed beings.
How many are the five-sensed imperfect beings, in terms of their substance-measure? They are innumerable. || 84 ||

[74] In the six-fold world, the number of living beings is:

[1, 2, 107] In terms of time, the number of *Vachanayogi* and *Anubhayavachanayogi* with wrong views is countless, being taken away by countless *Avasarpini* and *Utsarpini* periods. [107]

In terms of space, the number of *Vachanayogi* and *Anubhayavachanayogi* with wrong views is taken away by a square portion of the number of *Angula* (a unit of measurement), being taken away by the *Jagapratar* (a unit of measurement). [108]

The number of *Vachanayogi* and *Anubhayavachanayogi* with right views, starting from *Sasadan Samyagdrishti* and going up to the other *Gunasthanas* (stages of spiritual development), is equal to the number of *Manoyogi* (those who have developed their mind). [109]

The number of *Kayayogi* and *Audarik Kayayogi* with wrong views is equal to the number of *Moologha* (a unit of measurement). [110]

The meaning is that both these numbers are infinite. In terms of time, the number of *Kayayogi* and *Audarik Kayayogi* with wrong views is not taken away by infinite *Avasarpini* and *Utsarpini* periods. In terms of space, they are infinite *Lokapraman* (units of measurement).

From *Sasadan Samyagdrishti* to *Sayogik Kevali* (the highest stage of spiritual development), the number of *Kayayogi* and *Audarik Kayayogi* with wrong views is equal to the number of *Manoyogi*. [111]

The number of *Audarik Misra Kayayogi* with wrong views is equal to the number of *Moologha*. [112]

The number of *Audarik Misra Kayayogi* with right views is equal to the number of *Sasadan Samyagdrishti*. [113]

How many *Asanjad Samyagdrishti* and *Sayogik Kevali* *Audarik Misra Kayayogi* are there in terms of *Dravyapraman* (a unit of measurement)? They are countable. [114]

How many *Vaikriyik Kayayogi* with wrong views are there in terms of *Dravyapraman*? They are less than a countable portion of the number of *Devas* (gods). [115]

In the neuter-bodied beings, from the Mithyadrishti to the Sanjata-Sanjata Gunasthan, the number of beings in each Gunasthan is like the flow of a river. || 129 ||
From the Pramatta-Sanjata Gunasthan to the Anivriti-Badar-Samparaya-Pravishta-Uvasama and Kshapaka Gunasthan, how many beings are there in terms of dravya-pramana? Countless. || 130 ||
In the Ap-gat-vedi beings, how many beings are there in the three Gunasthan of Uvasama in terms of dravya-pramana? One, or two, or three, or even four, according to the entry. || 131 ||
The number of Ap-gat-vedi Uvasama beings in the three Gunasthan is countless, according to time. || 132 ||
The number of Ap-gat-vedi Kshapaka and A-yogik-kevali beings in the three Gunasthan is like the flow of a river. || 133 ||

---------------------------
[1, 2, 139] The number of beings in accordance with the measure of substance
[77] are the same. || 133 ||
The stream of the non-associated liberated beings. || 134 || The stream of the non-associated liberated beings is similar to the stream of the associated liberated beings. || 134 || Now, we will describe the number of beings in accordance with the path of passions.
According to the description of passions, the number of beings with the passion of anger, the passion of pride, the passion of deceit, and the passion of greed, from the state of wrong belief to the state of restrained and restrained, is similar to the general description of the measure of substance in each state. || 135 ||
From the state of careless and restrained to the state of non-elimination, how many are the beings with the four passions in accordance with the measure of substance? Count them. || 136 ||
By adding the time of the four passions and multiplying it by four, and then dividing it by its own time, the number obtained is the desired amount. Accordingly, the number of beings with the passion of pride is the least. The number of beings with the passion of anger is significantly more than the number of beings with the passion of pride. The number of beings with the passion of deceit is significantly more than the number of beings with the passion of anger. The number of beings with the passion of greed is significantly more than the number of beings with the passion of deceit.
However, the number of beings with the passion of greed, the subtle, subtle, pure, restrained, pacified, and destroyed beings, is similar to the general description. || 137 ||
The reason for this is that in the subtle, subtle, pure, restrained, pacified, and destroyed beings, no other passion is found except the subtle passion of greed.
The number of beings without passions, the pacified passion, the passionless, and the veiled beings, is similar to the general description. || 138 ||
Here, the beings with pacified passions are called passionless in accordance with the absence of the motivating force, not in accordance with the absence of the substance of passion; because, here, the substance of karma is found, which is devoid of arising, stimulation, weakening, strengthening, and transition to another nature.
The number of beings with weakened passion, the seed of passion, and the veiled beings, the non-associated liberated beings, is similar to the stream of the non-associated liberated beings. || 139 ||

---------------------------
[78] In the six-fold division of the universe, the number of living beings is as follows:

[1, 2, 140] The number of *kṣīṇakṣaya-vītarāga-chhadmastha* and *ayogikevalī* beings is the same as the general number of beings. [139]
The number of *sayogikevalī* beings is the same as the general number of beings. [140] Now, we will determine the number of beings according to the path of knowledge.

How many *mithyādṛṣṭi* and *sāsanasammyagdṛṣṭi* beings are there in terms of the number of substances, according to the path of knowledge? The number is the same as the general number of beings. [141]

How many *mithyādṛṣṭi* beings are there in terms of the number of substances, according to the path of knowledge? They are slightly more than the number of gods. [142]
The number of *vibhanga* *sāsanasammyagdṛṣṭi* beings is the same as the general number of beings, but they are an innumerable fraction of the total number of beings. [143]

The number of *ābhinibohik* *śruta* and *avadhi* beings, from the *asanyata sammyagdṛṣṭi* *guṇasthāna* to the *kṣīṇakṣaya-vītarāga-chhadmastha* *guṇasthāna*, is the same as the general number of beings. [144]

There is a difference in the number of *avadhi* beings, from the *pramatta-sanyata* *guṇasthāna* to the *kṣīṇakṣaya-vītarāga-chhadmastha* *guṇasthāna*, in terms of the number of substances. They are countable. [145]

The number of *manaparyaya* beings, from the *pramatta-sanyata* *guṇasthāna* to the *kṣīṇakṣaya-vītarāga-chhadmastha* *guṇasthāna*, in terms of the number of substances, is countable. [146]

The number of *kevala* beings, both *sayogikevalī* and *ayogikevalī*, is the same as the general number of beings. [147]

Dravyapramanaanugame samjamamargana
Regarding the Samyag-marga (right path), the enumeration of the number of souls is as follows:

Samjamanuvadenha samjadesu pramattasamjata pahudi jāva ajogikevali iti ogham.
According to the exposition of the Samyag-marga, the souls in the stages from Pramatta-samyata (careless self-restrained) to Ayogi-kevali (non-yogic omniscient) are enumerated in a general manner.

Samāika-chedopavāṇa-suddhi-samjadesu pramattasamjata pahudi jāva anivṛtti-bādara-sāmpārāika-pravishṭha upasama-khavā iti ogham.
In the Samāyika (equanimity), Chedopavāṇa (interruption of equanimity), Śuddhi-samyata (pure self-restrained) stages, the souls from Pramatta-samyata to Anivṛtti-bādara, Sāmpārāyika, Pravishṭha, Upasama, and Kshapaka are enumerated in a general manner.

Parihāra-suddhisamjadesu pramattāpramattasamjatā dravyapramāṇena kevadiyā? Samkhejjā.
In the Parihāra-śuddhi-samyata (purified self-restrained) stages, how many are the Pramatta-samyata (careless self-restrained) and Apramatta-samyata (non-careless self-restrained) souls in terms of the measure of substances? They are countable.

Suhumasāmpārāika-suddhisamjadesu suhumasāmpārāika-suddhisamjatā upasama-khavā dravyapramāṇena kevadiyā? Ogham.
In the Sūkshma-sāmpārāyika-śuddhi-samyata (subtle karmic impurity-free self-restrained) stages, how many are the Sūkshma-sāmpārāyika-śuddhi-samyata, Upasama, and Kshapaka souls in terms of the measure of substances? They are in a general manner.

Jahā-khāda-vihārasuddhasamjadesu cauththāṇam ogham.
As explained, in the Yathākhyāta-vihāra-śuddha-samyata (perfectly pure self-restrained) stages, the enumeration of the souls in the eleventh, twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth stages is in a general manner.

Samjatāsamjatā dravyamāṇena kevadiyā? Ogham.
How many are the Samyata (self-restrained) and Asamyata (non-self-restrained) souls in terms of the measure of substances? They are in a general manner.

Asamjadesu micchaitthi pahudi jāva asamjatasammāitti iti dravyapramāṇena kevadiyā? Ogham.
In the Asamyata (non-self-restrained) stages, how many are the souls from Mithyādṛṣṭi (false belief) to Asamyata-sammādṛṣṭi (non-self-restrained right belief) in terms of the measure of substances? They are in a general manner.

Now, the enumeration of the number of souls regarding the Darśana-mārga (path of right faith) is presented.

Page #205:
---------------------------
[80] In the Cakkhanḍagama, the number of living beings is described as follows:

[1, 1, 155] According to the Dasanāṇuvāda, how many Cakṣudarsanī beings are there with Mithyādṛṣṭi, in terms of dravya-pramāṇa? They are countless. || 155 ||

[1, 1, 156] In terms of time, countless Cakṣudarsanī beings with Mithyādṛṣṭi are taken away by the Avasarpini and Utsarpini periods. || 156 ||

[1, 1, 157] In terms of the field, the number of Cakṣudarsanī beings with Mithyādṛṣṭi is taken away by the square of the number of parts of an angula, which is a measure of length. || 157 ||

[1, 1, 158] From the Sāsana-Sammā-Iṭṭhi-Pahuḍi to the Kṣīṇa-Kṣaya-Vīta-Raga-Chhadumatta, all Cakṣudarsanī beings are similar in terms of their Ova-prūpaṇā. || 158 ||

[1, 1, 159] From the Mithyādṛṣṭi-Pahuḍi to the Kṣīṇa-Kṣaya-Vīta-Raga-Chhadumatta, all Acākṣudarsanī beings are similar in terms of their Ova-prūpaṇā. || 159 ||

The reason for this is that all beings in the Chhadumatta state have their Acākṣudarsanāvaraṇa destroyed. Therefore, their number is said to be similar to the Ova-prūpaṇā.

[1, 1, 160] The dravya-prūpaṇā of the Avadhi-darsanī beings is similar to that of the Avadhi-jñānī beings. || 160 ||

[1, 1, 161] The dravya-prūpaṇā of the Kevala-darsanī beings is similar to that of the Kevala-jñānī beings. || 161 ||

Since Kevala-darsan is not found without Kevala-jñāna, the number of both is the same.

Now, we will describe the number of beings in terms of the Leśyā-mārgaṇā.

[1, 1, 162] According to the Leśyā-mārgaṇā, the number of beings with Kṛṣṇa-leśyā, Nīla-leśyā, and Kāpota-leśyā, from the Mithyādṛṣṭi-Pahuḍi to the Asanjad-Sammā-Iṭṭhi, is similar to the Ova-prūpaṇā. || 162 ||

Page #206:
---------------------------
[1, 2, 170]  In terms of the amount of dravya, the number of beings in each gunasthana from Mithyadrishti to Asanyata Samyagdristi is like the number of waves in the ocean. [162]
How many beings with Tejo-leshya are there in terms of the amount of dravya? They are slightly more than the number of Jyotishi Devas. [163]
From the gunasthana of Sasadan Samyagdristi to the gunasthana of Sanjata-Sanjata, the number of beings with Tejo-leshya in each gunasthana is like the number of waves in the ocean, but they are an innumerable fraction of the number of waves. [164]
How many beings with Tejo-leshya are there in terms of the amount of dravya, who are Pramatta-Sanjata and Apramatta-Sanjata? They are countable. [165]
How many beings with Padma-leshya are there in terms of the amount of dravya, who are Mithyadrishti? They are a countable fraction of the number of beings with five senses and the number of beings in the Tiryanch Yoni. [166]
From the gunasthana of Sasadan Samyagdristi to the gunasthana of Sanjata-Sanjata, the number of beings with Padma-leshya in each gunasthana is like the number of waves in the ocean. [167]
How many beings with Padma-leshya are there in terms of the amount of dravya, who are Pramatta-Sanjata and Apramatta-Sanjata? They are countable. [168]
How many beings with Shukla-leshya are there in terms of the amount of dravya, from the gunasthana of Mithyadrishti to the gunasthana of Sanjata-Sanjata? They are an innumerable fraction of the number of waves in the ocean. These beings take away the number of waves in the ocean in the time of an Antarmukhurta. [169]
How many beings with Shukla-leshya are there in terms of the amount of dravya, who are Pramatta-Sanjata and Apramatta-Sanjata? They are countable. [170]

##  Chhakkhandagama Jivat-tana

**171.**  The number of Jivas in each Gunasthan from A-purvakaran to Sayogikevali is the same, like the general form of their Dravya-pratiroopana.

**82.** Since there are no other Leshyas except Shukla-leshya in Gunasthanas like A-purvakaran, the number of Shukla-leshya Jivas is the same as the number of Oghas. A-yogikevali Jivas are without Leshyas because they do not have Yog and Kshayas, which are the causes of Karma-lep.

**Now, we will describe the number of Jivas in relation to the Bhavya-marg: **

**172.**  The number of Jivas in each Gunasthan from Mithyadristi to A-yogikevali in Bhavya-siddhis is the same, like the general form of their Dravya-pratiroopana, according to the Bhavya-anuvaad.

**173.** How many are the Jivas in Abhavya-siddhis in terms of Dravya-pramaan? They are infinite.

**Now, we will describe the number of Jivas in relation to the Samyak-tvamarg: **

**174.** The number of Jivas in each Gunasthan from Asanjat-samyak-dristi to A-yogikevali in Samyak-dristi is the same, like the general form of their Dravya-pratiroopana, according to the Sammatta-anuvaad.

**175.** The number of Jivas in Kshayik-samyak-dristi is the same as the number of Asanjat-samyak-dristi Jivas, like the general form of their Dravya-pratiroopana.

**176.** How many are the Kshayik-samyak-dristi Jivas in terms of Dravya-pramaan from Sanjat-asanjat Gunasthan to Uvasant-kshaya-vit-rag-chhad-mattha Gunasthan? They are countable.

**177.** The four Kshapak and A-yogikevali Jivas are the same in terms of Ogh-pratiroopana.

**178.** The number of Sayogikevali Jivas is the same, like the general form of their Dravya-pratiroopana.

Page #208:
---------------------------
[1, 2, 188] The **dravya-pramāṇa** (material nature) of the beings in the **saṇṇi-maggaṇā** (path of knowledge) is the same as the general **pramāṇa** (nature).
[83] In the **veda-kṣama-samyag-dṛṣṭi** (perfect vision of the wise), the **dravya-pramāṇa** of the beings from the **asañyata-samyag-dṛṣṭi** (uncontrolled perfect vision) **guṇa-sthāna** (stage of virtue) to the **apramatta-sañyata** (attentive controlled) **guṇa-sthāna** is the same as the general **pramāṇa**. || 179 ||
In the **upasama-samyag-dṛṣṭi** (perfect vision of the calmed), the **dravya-pramāṇa** of the beings from the **asañyata-samyag-dṛṣṭi** to the **sañyata-sañyata** (controlled controlled) is the same as the general **pramāṇa**. || 180 ||
- From the **pramatta-sañyata** (attentive controlled) **guṇa-sthāna** to the **upasānta-kṣaya-vītarāga-chhadma-stha** (calm-decayed-freed-from-passion-hidden-state) **guṇa-sthāna**, how many are the **upasama-samyag-dṛṣṭi** beings in terms of **dravya-pramāṇa**? They are countable. || 181 ||
In the **sāsādana-samyag-dṛṣṭi** (perfect vision of the teacher), the **dravya-pramāṇa** of the beings is the same as the general **pramāṇa**. || 182 ||
In the **samyag-mithyā-dṛṣṭi** (perfect-false vision), the **dravya-pramāṇa** of the beings is the same as the **oha-pramāṇa** (nature of the stream). || 183 ||
In the **mithyā-dṛṣṭi** (false vision), the **dravya-pramāṇa** of the beings is the same as the general **pramāṇa**. || 184 ||
Now, we will discuss the number of beings in terms of **sañjñī-mārgaṇā** (path of knowledge).
According to the **saṇṇī-āṇuvāda** (theory of knowledge), how many are the **mithyā-dṛṣṭi** beings in terms of **dravya-pramāṇa** in the **saṇṇī** (knowers)? They are slightly more than the **deva** (gods). || 185 ||
All **deva** are **sañjñī** (knowers) with **mithyā-dṛṣṭi**, and since the **sañjñī** with **mithyā-dṛṣṭi** in the remaining three **gati** (paths) are only a fraction of those **deva**, therefore, the number of **sañjñī** with **mithyā-dṛṣṭi** is stated here as slightly more than the **deva**.
From the **sāsādana-samyag-dṛṣṭi** **guṇa-sthāna** to the **kṣīṇa-kṣaya-vītarāga-chhadma-stha** **guṇa-sthāna**, the **dravya-pramāṇa** of each **sañjñī** being in each **guṇa-sthāna** is the same as the general **pramāṇa**. || 186 ||
How many are the **asañjñī** (non-knowers) in terms of **dravya-pramāṇa**? They are infinite. || 187 ||
The infinite **asañjñī** do not decrease in number over time due to **osa-p-p-iṇī** (birth) and **ussa-p-p-iṇī** (death). || 188 ||

[84] In the six-fold space, the abode of living beings
[1, 2, 188] With respect to time, the *asangya* and *mithyadristi* living beings are not carried away by the infinite and endless *avasarpinis* and *utsarpinis*. || 188 ||
With respect to the field, they are infinite in number. || 189 ||
Now, with respect to the *aaharmarg* (path of nourishment), we describe the number of living beings.
With respect to the *aahar* (nourishment), the number of living beings from the *mithyadristi* *gunasthan* (stage of virtue) to the *sayogikevali* *gunasthan* (stage of virtue) is like a stream. || 190 ||
With respect to the *anaahar* (non-nourishment), the number of living beings is like the number of *karmakayayogi* (those who have a karmic body). || 191 ||
The number of *anaahar* *ayogikevali* (non-nourishment, non-liberated) living beings is like the general number. || 192 ||

## 3. Kshetranugamo

Kshetranugame, there are two types of niddhesa: Ogha-niddhesa and Aadesha-niddhesa. || 1 ||

The Kshetranugam Anuyogadwar has been obtained to provide knowledge about the kshetra (field) related to the fourteen jivasamasas, whose existence has been known through the Satpraroopanā Anuyogadwar and whose number has been established through the Dravyapramananugam. Alternatively, this Kshetranugam Anuyogadwar has been obtained to address the doubt about how the infinite number of jivas are situated in the infinite Lokakasha, which is comprised of countless regions.

Initially, the kshetra is deposited. This deposition is of four types based on name, sthapana, dravya, and bhava. The word "kshetra" itself, without any other reason, is called Namakshetra. The imagination of "this is the kshetra" in a dravya, whether it is tadakar or atadakar, is called Sthapanakshetra.

Dravyakshetra is of two types: Agamdravyakshetra and Noagamdravyakshetra. The kshetrapraabhrut, which is known but not currently used, is called Agamdravyakshetra. Noagamdravyakshetra is of three types: Jnayaka-sharira, Bhaavi, and Tadvyatirikt. Jnayaka-sharira is of three types: Bhaavi Jnayaka-sharira, Vartaman Jnayaka-sharira, and Atit Jnayaka-sharira. Atit Jnayaka-sharira is also of three types: Chuyut, Chyaavit, and Tyakt. The one who will know the kshetra-related shastra in the future is called Bhaavi Noagamdravyakshetra. The Noagamdravyakshetra, which is different from Jnayaka-sharira and Bhaavi, is of two types: Karmadravyakshetra and Nokarmadravyakshetra. The eight types of karmadravyas, such as Jnanavaran, are called Tadvyatirikt Noagamkarmadravyakshetra. Nokarmadravyakshetra is of two types: औपचारिक (Aupacharic) and पारमार्थिक (Paramarthik). The shaktikshetra and godhum (wheat) etc., which are famous in the lok, are called Aupacharic Tadvyatirikt Noagam-Nokarmadravyakshetra. Akashadravy is the Paramarth Tadvyatirikt Noagam-Nokarmadravyakshetra.

Bhavakshetra is of two types: Agambhavakshetra and Noagambhavakshetra. The jiva who knows the kshetra-related graabhrut and is also using it in the present time is called Agambhavakshetra. The jiva who is suitable for other substances without using the kshetra-related shastra is called Noagambhavakshetra.

##  The Sixfold Division of the Universe and the Nature of Space

The **Sixfold Division of the Universe** (Chhakkanḍāgama) describes the nature of space and the dwelling places of living beings (Jīvas). 

**Space** (Ākāśa) is infinite and eternal, existing in two forms:

* **Loka-ākāśa:** The space where Jīvas and other substances are found.
* **A-loka-ākāśa:** The space where Jīvas and other substances are not found.

**Space** can also be categorized based on its location:

* **Ūrdhva-loka:** The region above the peak of Mount Meru.
* **Adho-loka:** The region below the base of Mount Meru.
* **Madhya-loka:** The region encompassing the height of Mount Meru.

**Madhya-loka** is further divided into:

* **Manuṣya-loka:** The region inhabited by humans, extending up to 2.5 Dwīpas.
* **Tiryag-loka:** The remaining region of Madhya-loka, inhabited by non-human beings.

**Understanding the location of Jīvas** is crucial for comprehending their current state of existence.

**Anugam** refers to the knowledge of the state of existence of substances. **Kṣetranugam** specifically refers to the knowledge of the state of existence of space.

**Kṣetranugam** can be further categorized into two types of instructions:

* **Oghanirdeśa:** General instructions.
* **Ādeśanirdeśa:** Specific instructions.

**Oghanirdeśa** is explained in the **Uttarasūtra:**

"**Oghena micchāṭṭhī kevaḍikhette? Savvaloge.**" (2)

This translates to: "**In which region do the beings with false vision (Mithyādrṣṭi) reside? They reside in all the regions.**" (2)

**Jagashreṇī** is a unit of measurement, seven times larger than **Rāju**. **Jagapratar** refers to the square of Jagashreṇī, and **Ghanaloka** refers to its cube.

**Loka** (the universe) is shaped like a **Vetrāsana** (a cane seat) at the bottom, a **Jhallarī** (a sieve) in the middle, and a **Mṛdanga** (a drum) at the top. Its height is **fourteen Rājus**.

**Loka** is divided into four regions based on its width:

* **Adho-loka:** Seven Rājus at the end.
* **Madhya-loka:** One Rāju near the middle.
* **Brahma-loka:** Five Rājus near the top.
* **Ūrdhva-loka:** One Rāju at the end.

**Kṣetra-pramaṇ** (measurement of space) considers three states of Jīvas:

* **Svasthānagat:** The state of being in one's own place.
* **Samudghātagat:** The state of being outside one's own place due to specific causes.
* **Upāpadgat:** The state of being in a new place.

**Svasthānagat** is further divided into two states:

* **Svasthānasvasthānagat:** The state of being in one's own place, engaging in activities like walking, sitting, and standing.
* **Viharavatsvasthānagat:** The state of being outside one's own place, engaging in activities like sleeping, walking, and traveling.

**Samudghāta** refers to the state of the soul (Ātmā) leaving certain parts of its body due to specific causes like pain, without leaving the main body. It is categorized into seven types:

* **Vedanasamudghāta:** Leaving the body due to pain.
* **Kaṣāyasamudghāta:** Leaving the body due to passions like anger and fear.
* **Vaikriyikasamudghāta:** Leaving the body due to the natural inclination of Devas and Narakas.
* **Māraṇāntikasamudghāta:** Leaving the body at the time of death.
* **Taijasasamudghāta:** Leaving the body due to fire.
* **Āhārakasamudghāta:** Leaving the body due to food.
* **Kevalisamudghāta:** Leaving the body due to liberation.

[ 1, 3, 3 ]
The **Oghanise** is the **Vaikriyika Samudghat** which is the manifestation of the **Aakaraka**. The **Maranantik Samudghat** is the manifestation of the **Atma Pradesh** from the body, either directly or through **Vigrah Gati**, before death, and staying in the area where it is to be born for a moment. It is different from **Vedana Samudghat** and **Kshaya Samudghat** in that it only occurs in **Baddhayushk** beings, while the other two occur in both **Baddhayushk** and **Abaddhayushk** beings. The **Maranantik Samudghat** is directed towards the area where it is to be born, while there is no such rule for **Vedana Samudghat** and **Kshaya Samudghat**. The **Taijas Samudghat** is the manifestation of the **Taijas Sharira**. It is of two types: **Nissaranatmak** and **Anissaranatmak**. The **Nissaranatmak Taijas Samudghat** is also of two types: **Prashasht Taijas** and **Aprashasht Taijas**. The **Prashasht Taijas Samudghat** is the **Taijas Putala** that emerges from the right shoulder of a great ascetic, due to compassion for the people suffering from famine, etc., in order to save them. The **Aprashasht Taijas Samudghat** is the **Taijas Putala** that emerges from the left shoulder of an ascetic, when he is angry with someone, and burns an area nine yojanas wide and twelve yojanas long. The **Anissaranatmak Taijas Samudghat** is the light and brilliance that exists within the body. It is not discussed here.
I
The **Aharaka Samudghat** is the white **Putala** the size of a hand that emerges from the head of a **Mahamuni** who is **Pramat** and **Gunasthanavarti**, when he has doubts about the subtle elements, and there is no **Kevali** or **Shruta Kevali** in his area of residence. It touches the feet of the **Kevali** and returns to the body of the **Sadhu**, resolving the doubts of the **Muni**. The **Kevala Samudghat** is the manifestation of the **Atma Pradesh** from the body of a **Kevali Bhagwan**, in the form of **Dand**, **Kapat**, **Pratar**, and **Lokpuran**, when the **Ayu Karma** is less and the other three **Aghatiya Karmas** are more, in order to balance them.
.
The **Uppaad** is the tendency that occurs in the first moment of the **Uttar Bhav**, to leave the old body and take on a new body. The area of the sky that a being occupies through these ten states is described in terms of **Gunasthan** and **Margana**, according to the **Prakrit Kshetranugam**. For example, **Mithyadrishti** beings live in all the **Lokas**, according to **Swasthan**, **Vedana**, **Kshaya**, **Maranantik Samudghat**, and **Uppaad**.
How many areas do beings living in each **Gunasthan**, from **Sasadan Samyagdristi Gunasthan** to **Ayogik Kevali Gunasthan**, occupy? They occupy an area equal to an **Asankhyeya** part of the **Lokas**. || 3 ||

Although the term 'Prabhriti' in the system can encompass all Gunasthanas, here we should not include the Sayogikevali Gunasthan. This is because an exception to this will be mentioned in the subsequent sutra.

The Saasadan Samyagdristi, Samyagmithyadristi, and Asanyata Samyagdristi Jivas, who have undergone transformation into the forms of Svasthan, Viharavatsvasthan, Vedanasamudhat, Kashayasamudhat, and Vaikriyikasamudhat, reside in an area equivalent to an innumerable fraction of the common Lok, an innumerable fraction of the area of the three Lokas (Urdhvalok, etc.), and an area multiplied by an innumerable number from the Manusyalok. Similarly, one should know the area of the Marananthikasamudhat and Upapadagat Saasadan Samyagdristi and Asanyata Samyagdristi Jivas. It is noteworthy that only an innumerable fraction of the total number of these Jivas resides in the Marananthikasamudhat and Upapadagat states. Similarly, one should know the area of the Sanayata-Asanayatas. It is noteworthy that they do not undergo Upapad.

The Prammatasanayata, etc., all Sanayata Jivas reside in an innumerable fraction of the common Lok and the four Lokas, and in a countable fraction of the Manusyalok. However, the Marananthikasamudhat Sanayata Jivas reside in an area multiplied by an innumerable number from the Manusyalok. Here, it is important to note that the Prammatasanayata also undergoes Aharak and Taijas Samudhat. The area of the Prammatasanayata in the Aharak Samudhat is as mentioned above. However, the area of the Taijas Samudhat is obtained by multiplying the area of a sphere with a diameter of nine Yojanas and a height of twelve Yojanas by a countable fraction of the Angula. This gives the area of one Taijas Samudhat of a Jiva. Multiplying this by the appropriate number gives the total area of the Taijas Samudhat.

**Sayogikevali Kevadikhette? Logass Asankhajatibhage Asankhejesu Va Bhagesu Savvaloge Va. || 4 ||**

In what area do the Sayogikevali Jivas reside? They reside in an area equivalent to an innumerable fraction of the Lok, or in an area equivalent to an innumerable number of fractions of the Lok, or in the entire Lok. || 4 ||

The Dandasamudhat Kevali resides in an innumerable fraction of the common Lok and the four Lokas, and in an area multiplied by an innumerable number from the area related to the two and a half Dvipas. The Kapatasamudhat Kevali resides in an innumerable fraction of the common Lok, Adholk, and Urdhvalok, in a countable fraction of the Tiryanchlok, and in an area multiplied by an innumerable number from the two and a half Dvipas. The Pratarasamudhat Kevali resides in an area equivalent to an innumerable number of fractions of the Lok. This is because the Pratarasamudhat Kevali resides in all areas except the area equivalent to an innumerable fraction of the Lok, which is the area opposite the Vatavalyar. The Lokpuranasamudhat Kevali resides in the entire Lok.

Thus, having described the area in relation to the Ogh, now the area is described in relation to the Aadesh.

Because the attached liberated beings, unlike the beings in the stages of right belief according to the teachings, etc., reside not only in an innumerable part of the universe but also in an innumerable majority of the universe and in the entire universe, their realm is described separately in this sutra, not in the previous sutra.

## 4. Fosanaanugama

Fosanaanugama, in terms of its direction, is of two types: Ogha-nidesha and Aadesha-nidesha. || 1 ||

Sparshanaanugama, in terms of its expectation, is of two types: Ogha-nidesha and Aadesha-nidesha. || 1 ||

Sparshana is of six types: Naamasparshana, Sthapanaasparshana, Dravyasparshana, Kshetrasparshana, Kaalasparshana, and Bhaavasparshana. Among these, the word 'Sparshana' is a synonym for Naamasparshana. This is what it is. Establishing the oneness of one substance with another substance through this type of intellect is called Sthapanaasparshana. For example, in a pot, a pitcher, etc., "This is Rishabha, this is Ajita, this is Abhinandan, etc." Dravyasparshana is of two types: Aagamadravyasparshana and Noaagamadravyasparshana. Among these, a living being who is aware of the substance of touch and is devoid of its use in the present is called Aagamadravyasparshana. Noaagamadravyasparshana is of three types: Jnayakasharira, Bhaavi, and Tadvyatirikta. Among these, Jnayakasharira Noaagamadravyasparshana is of three types: Bhaavi, Vartamaan, and Samujjhit. A living being who is going to be aware of the substance of touch in the future is called Bhaavi Noaagamadravyasparshana. Tadvyatirikta Noaagamadravyasparshana is of three types: Sachitta, Achitta, and Mishra. The mutual contact of Sachitta substances is called Sachitta Dravyasparshana. The mutual contact of Achitta substances is called Achitta Dravyasparshana. The mixed Dravyasparshana, which arises from the contact of all six substances of the conscious and unconscious nature, is divided into sixty-nine (59) types.

The contact of the remaining substances with the Akasha substance is called Kshetrasparshana. The contact of the Kala substance with other substances is called Kaalasparshana. Bhaavasparshana is of two types: Aagama and Noaagama. A living being who is aware of the substance of touch and is involved in its use in the present is called Aagamabhaavasparshana. The Pudgala substance transformed by the Sparshaguna is called Noaagamabhaavasparshana.

Out of the above six types of Sparshana, the Kshetrasparshana related to the Jiva substance is relevant here. What has been touched in the past and is being touched in the present is called Sparshana. The following of Sparshana is called Sparshanaanugama. Nidesha, Kathana, and Vyakhyana are all synonymous words. This Nidesha, in terms of its expectation of Sparshanaanugama, is of two types: Ogha-nidesha and Aadesha-nidesha.

How much Kshetra has been touched by the Mithyadrishti Jiva through Ogha? All beings. || 2 ||

## Chapter 102: The Extent of the Living Beings in the Six Realms

Previously, in the *Kshetranuyoga*, the extent of all the *margana* realms was established, based on the present time. Now, in this *Anuyogadwar*, recalling the previously mentioned extent of the present time, the extent of all the *guna-sthana* realms is established based on the past time, using the same fourteen *margana* realms.

For example, all the *mithyadrishti* living beings, in general, have touched all the realms in the past. Specifically, the *mithyadrishti* living beings in the *khasthana-svathana*, *vedana*, *kashaya*, *maranantik* *samudghata*, and *uppapada* realms have touched all the realms in the past and present. The *mithyadrishti* living beings in the *viharavat-svathana* and *vaikriyika* *samudghata* realms have touched an innumerable part of the *samanya* realm and the other three realms in the present time, a countable part of the *tiryag* realm, and an innumerable number of *kshetra* realms from the *ardhadwipa*. In the past, they have touched a little less than eight-fourteenths (8/14) of the *raju* realms. This is because, by dividing the *lokanali* into fourteen parts, and combining the two parts below the base of Mount Meru and the six parts above it, we get eight-fourteenths. Since these are less than one thousand *yojana* below the third earth, it is said to be a little less.

**How much *kshetra* did the *sasadan-samyagdristi* touch?** They touched an innumerable part of the *loka*.

The *sasadan-samyagdristi* living beings in the *khasthana-svathana*, *viharavat-svathana*, *vedana*, *kashaya*, *vaikriyika*, *maranantik* *samudghata*, and *uppapada* realms have touched an innumerable part of the *samanya* realm and the other three realms in the present time, and an innumerable number of *kshetra* realms from the *manushya* realm.

**They touched eight-twelfths and fourteen-fourteenths (8/12 and 14/14) of the *kshetra* realms.**

The *sasadan-samyagdristi* living beings in the *khasthana-svathana* realm have touched an innumerable part of the *samanya* realm and the other three realms in the past, a countable part of the *tiryag* realm, and an innumerable number of *kshetra* realms from the *manushya* realm. The *sasadan-samyagdristi* living beings in the *viharavat-svathana*, *vedana*, *kashaya*, and *vaikriyika* *samudghata* realms have touched a little less than twelve-fourteenths (12/14) of the *kshetra* realms. This is because, from the base of Mount Meru to the *ishta-pragbhar* earth, there are seven *raju* realms, and from there to the sixth earth, there are five *raju* realms. Combining these two, we get the length of the *maranantik* realm of the *sasadan-samyagdristi* living beings. The *sasadan-samyagdristi* living beings in the *uppapada* realm have touched a little less than eleven-fourteenths (11/14) of the *kshetra* realms. This is because, from the base of Mount Meru to the sixth earth, there are five *raju* realms, and from there to the *aran-achyuta* kalpa...

The said beings in the *upapāda* have touched six out of fourteen parts less. The reason for this is that the *upapādakṣetra* of the *asanyatasamyagdṛṣṭi* beings is not found below it.

[116] In the six-fold world, the extent of the living beings' sphere of influence:

[1, 4, 99] They do not have it. In the *Upāpāda* stage, the *Sāsādana-samyagdṛṣṭi* living beings with a *kārmāṇakāya* (karmic body) touch a region of fourteen *rājus* (14 *rājus* in total), five *rājus* below the *mehatala* (earth) and six *rājus* above it.

In the *Upāpāda* stage, the *asamyata-samyagdṛṣṭi* living beings of the *tiryañc* (animal) realm are born above the *mehatala* up to six *rājus*, therefore their sphere of influence is defined as six out of fourteen parts. Here, the *Sāsādana-samyagdṛṣṭi* living beings do not have a sphere of influence below the *mehatala* up to five *rājus* like the *tiryañc* living beings, because the *nārki* (hellish) *asamyata-samyagdṛṣṭi* living beings do not have *Upāpāda* in the *tiryañc* realm.

[101] How much area has the *sayogika-kevali* (liberated being) with a *kārmāṇakāya* touched? It has touched an innumerable part of the *loka* and the entire *loka*.

The *sayogika-kevali* who has attained the *pratarasamudghāta* (first liberation) has touched an innumerable part of the *loka*, and the *sayogika-kevali* who has attained the *lokapūraṇasamudghāta* (complete liberation) has touched the entire *loka*.

[103] The *mithyādṛṣṭi* living beings of the *striveda* and *puruṣavedi* realms have touched eight out of fourteen parts of the *loka* and the entire *loka*, less than the past and future.

[104] How much area has the *Sāsādana-samyagdṛṣṭi* living being of the *striveda* and *puruṣavedi* realms touched? It has touched an innumerable part of the *loka*.

How much territory have the *Strīvedī* and *Puruṣavedī* *Sammāmiṭṭhi* (right-believing) and *Asanjad* (unrestrained) *Sammāmiṭṭhi* (right-believing) beings touched? They have touched an innumerable part of the *Loka* (universe).

They have touched an innumerable part of the *Loka* (universe).

**Verse 111:**

The *Napuṃsakavedī* (neuter) beings with *Miṭṭhi* (false belief) have touched the entire *Loka* (universe), like the *Oḍha* (garment).

**Verse 112:**

[1, 4, 113] The number of realms touched by the countless beings is countless. [112]
Twelve out of fourteen parts, or so. [113]
The Nupumsakavedi, who have the right view, have touched a little less than twelve out of fourteen parts of the past and future time. [113]

From the state of the restrained and heedless, up to the state of non-return, the span of the lifespan of each being in each state of being among the Nupumsakavedi beings is like a flood, the countless parts of the world. [117]
From the state of non-return, up to the state of the non-yogic Kevali, the span of the lifespan of each being in each state of being among the Apugatavedi beings is like a flood. [118]
The span of the lifespan of the Apugatavedi, who are the yogic Kevali, is like a flood. [119]
Although the span of the lifespan of the yogic Kevali beings could be known from the previous sutra, the span of their lifespan is described in this separate sutra to show the difference between the span of the lifespan of the previous beings and the span of the lifespan of the yogic Kevali beings.
According to the doctrine of the passions, the span of the lifespan of those who are passionate about anger, pride, deceit, and greed, from the state of the wrong view up to the state of non-return, is like a flood. [120]

## 5. Kalānugama

Kalānugama has two types of instructions: Oghanirdesha and Aadeshanirdesha. ||1||

Time is of four types: Nāmakāla, Sthāpanākāla, Dravyakāla and Bhāvakāla. The word 'kāla' itself is called Nāmakāla. 'To attribute something else to something else through intellect' is called Sthāpanā. This Sthāpanā is of two types: Sadbhāva and Asadbhāva. Attributing the intended time to a particular object that imitates time through intellect is called Sadbhāvasthāpanākāla. For example, the spring season depicted in a painting, full of sprouts, leaves, flowers, and the sweet melody of cuckoos. One should know that Asadbhāvasthāpanākāla is different (opposite). For example, attributing spring to a particular gem, ochre, soil, or earthenware through the power of intellect, saying 'This is spring'.

Dravyakāla is of two types: Āgama and Noāgama. A being who knows the time-related Prābhṛta but is not using it in the present is called Āgama Dravyakāla. Noāgama Dravyakāla is of three types: Jñāyakaśarīra, Bhāvi and Tadvyatirikta. Among these, Jñāyakaśarīra Noāgama Dravyakāla is of three types: Bhāvi, Vartamāna and Samujjhit. A being who will know the time-related Prābhṛta in the future is called Bhāvi Noāgama Dravyakāla. A being who is formless and has a nature like the lower nail of a potter's wheel, like the Lokākāśa, is called Tadvyatirikta Noāgama Dravyakāla.

Bhāvakāla is of two types: Āgamabhāvakāla and Noāgamabhāvakāla. A being who knows the time-related Prābhṛta and is using it in the present is called Āgamabhāvakāla. The result arising from Dravyakāla is called Noāgamabhāvakāla. Among these types of time, one should consider Noāgamabhāvakāla as the dominant one, which is in the form of time, Āvali, Kṣaṇa, Lava, Muhūrta, Divasa, Pakṣa, and Māsa etc.

How long do Mithyādr̥ṣṭi beings exist due to Oghas? They exist for all time, compared to various beings. ||2||

The meaning is that Mithyādr̥ṣṭi beings exist for all time, compared to various beings.

[128] In the six-fold division of the universe, the duration of a living being's existence is as follows:

[1, 5, 3] There is no absence of them.
A single living being, in comparison, has three types of time according to the false view: anadi-ananta, anadi-santa, and sadi-santa. Of these, the sadi-santa time is described as follows: In comparison to a single living being, the sadi-santa time of a living being with a false view is as short as a jghannya-antarmuhurta. [3]

Here, the anadi-ananta time mentioned in comparison to a single living being should be understood as the time of an abhavy living being with a false view. This is because the false view of an abhavy living being has no beginning, no middle, and no end. The time of a bhavy living being with a false view (such as Vardhanakumar) is anadi but also santa, because he will attain liberation by being free from the false view. For some bhavy living beings with a false view, such as Krishna, the time of their false view is also sadi-santa, which is as short as a jghannya-antarmuhurta. This is explained as follows:

A samyag-mithyadristi, asanyata-samyagdristi, or samyata-asanyata or pramatta-samyata living being attains a false view due to the influence of karmas. There, he remains for a very short time, a jghannya-antarmuhurta, and then again attains samyag-mithyatva, samyaktva with asanyama, samyata-asanyama, or samyata with aprammatta. For such a living being, the time of his false view is found to be as short as a jghannya-antarmuhurta.

A sasadan-samyagdristi living being, having attained a false view, cannot easily abandon it due to the extreme complexity of karmas.

[4] In comparison to a single living being, the sadi-santa time of his false view is as short as half a pudgala-parivartan. [4]

How long do sasadan-samyagdristi living beings exist? In comparison to various living beings, they exist for as short as one moment. [5]

This one moment is described as follows: Two, or three, and so on, increasing in increments of one, up to an uncountable number of parts of a palya-upam, the upshama-samyagdristi living beings attained upshama-samyaktva for a time that was only one moment long. When only one moment remained, they all simultaneously attained the sasadan gunasthan. They remained there for one moment and then all attained a false view in the next moment. At that time, all three realms...

There is an absence of Sāsādan Samyagdṛṣṭi. Thus, in relation to the various beings, the Sāsādan Guṇasthāna obtains a time that is the least amount of time.
Ukkassena Palidovamassa Asankhejjadhibhāgo || 6 ||
In relation to the various beings, the Sāsādan Samyagdṛṣṭi beings have a time that is the greatest amount of time, which is an immeasurable portion of the Palyopama. || 6 ||
. Two, three, or four, in this way, increasing by one each time, only an immeasurable portion of the Palyopama, the Upasama Samyagdṛṣṭi beings, starting from one time, reach the Sāsādan Guṇasthāna after remaining for six Āvali, the amount of time of the Upasama Samyaktv, in the state of excellence. As long as they do not attain Mithyātva, other Upasama Samyagdṛṣṭi beings continue to attain the Sāsādan Guṇasthāna. In this way, the Sāsādan Guṇasthāna is filled with beings for a time that is only an immeasurable portion of the Palyopama in the state of excellence.
Egajīvam Paḍucch Jahanneṇa Egasamo || 7 ||
In relation to one being, the least amount of time for the Sāsādan Samyagdṛṣṭi is only one time. || 7 ||
One Upasama Samyagdṛṣṭi being, after remaining for one time in the time of the Upasama Samyaktv, attained the Sāsādan Guṇasthāna and, after staying with that Sāsādan Guṇasthāna for only one time, attained Mithyātva in the next time. In this way, the least amount of time for the Sāsādan Guṇasthāna in relation to one being is available for one time.
Ukkassena Chha Āvaliāo || 8 ||
In relation to one being, the greatest amount of time for the Sāsādan Samyagdṛṣṭi is six Āvali. || 8 ||
One Upasama Samyagdṛṣṭi being, after remaining for six Āvali in the time of the Upasama Samyaktv, attained the Sāsādan Guṇasthāna, remained there for six Āvali of time, and then attained Mithyātva. In this way, the greatest amount of time that the Sāsādan Samyagdṛṣṭi obtains is six Āvali. The reason why it does not obtain more time is that, if a being remains for more than six Āvali in the time of the Upasama Samyaktv, it does not attain the Sāsādan Guṇasthāna.

[130] In the six realms, the lifespan of a being is:
[1, 5, 10] In comparison to various beings, the superior time for beings with right and wrong faith is countless, like a moment. [10]
In comparison to a single being, the inferior time for beings with right and wrong faith is an antarmukha. [11]
A single being with wrong faith, becoming pure, attained right and wrong faith. Again, for the shortest antarmukha time, remaining with right and wrong faith, it became pure and attained right faith with non-restraint. Thus, in comparison to a single being, the inferior time for right and wrong faith is an antarmukha. Or, a being with right faith, who has attained the knowledge of the scriptures, attained wrong faith, and there, for the shortest antarmukha time, without losing the knowledge of the scriptures, attained wrong faith. Thus, that inferior time for right and wrong faith is also attained.
In comparison to a single being, the superior time for beings with right and wrong faith is an antarmukha. [12]
A single being with wrong faith, attaining purity, attained right and wrong faith, and there, for the longest antarmukha time, remaining with defilements, attained wrong faith. Thus, in comparison to a single being, the superior time for right and wrong faith is an antarmukha. This superior antarmukha time is a countable multiple of the inferior antarmukha time of this guna-sthana mentioned earlier. Or, a single being with right faith, who has attained the knowledge of the scriptures, attained right and wrong faith, and there, for the longest antarmukha time, became a being with right faith without restraint. Thus, that superior time for right and wrong faith is also attained.
How long do beings with right faith without restraint exist? In comparison to various beings, they exist for all time. [13]
This is because, in the past, future, and present, there is never a lack of beings with right faith without restraint.
In comparison to a single being, the inferior time for beings with right faith without restraint is an antarmukha. [14]
A single being with wrong faith, who has attained the twenty-eight types of moha karma, who has changed many times before into right faith with non-restraint, became a being with right faith without restraint. There, for the shortest antarmukha time, remaining with wrong faith,

[1, 5, 18]
The lowest time period for a being with the characteristics of *asanyata samyagdrishti* is *antarmuhurt* (a fraction of a moment) in comparison to a being who has attained *samyama* with *aprammatta bhava* (non-distracted state of mind), *samyagmithyatva* (right and wrong faith), *samyama-asanyama* (control and lack of control), or *aprammatta bhava* (non-distracted state of mind).
[131
The highest time period for a being with the characteristics of *asanyata samyagdrishti* is *tetis sagaropama* (equivalent to thirty-three oceans) in comparison to a being who has attained *samyama* with *aprammatta bhava* (non-distracted state of mind), *samyagmithyatva* (right and wrong faith), *samyama-asanyama* (control and lack of control), or *aprammatta bhava* (non-distracted state of mind).
[15
This is explained as follows: A being who is *pramatta samyata* (distracted and controlled), *aprammatta samyata* (non-distracted and controlled), or has attained one of the four *upashamaka* (calming factors) is born in the *anuttaravimana* (highest celestial realm) with a lifespan equivalent to *tetis sagaropama* (thirty-three oceans). After being expelled from there, they are born as a human with a lifespan equivalent to *purvakoti* (a very long period of time). They remain *asanyata samyagdrishti* (uncontrolled right faith) until the end of their lifespan, which is *antarmuhurt* (a fraction of a moment). Then, they attain *samyama* (control) with *aprammatta bhava* (non-distracted state of mind) (1). They then undergo thousands of changes in the *gunasthanas* (stages of development) of *pramatta* (distracted) and *aprammatta* (non-distracted) (2). They become *aprammatta samyata* (non-distracted and controlled) with complete purity, becoming worthy of the *kshapka shreni* (category of beings who experience very short lifespans) (3). They then become *apuurvakarana kshapaka* (a being who has not performed any previous actions), *anivrittikarana kshapaka* (a being who has not experienced any previous results), *sukshma samparaya kshapaka* (a being who has a subtle body), *kshinakshayavitaraga-chhadmastha* (a being who has subtle passions, is free from attachment, and is in a state of concealment), *sayogikevali* (a liberated being who has attained liberation with the help of others), and *ayogikevali* (a liberated being who has attained liberation without the help of others) (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). They then become a *siddha* (perfected being). Thus, the highest time period for a being with the characteristics of *asanyata samyagdrishti* is *tetis sagaropama* (thirty-three oceans), which is more than *purvakoti* (a very long period of time) and less than nine *antarmuhurt* (fractions of a moment).
[16
How long do *samyata-asanyata* (controlled and uncontrolled) beings exist? They exist for all time periods in comparison to other beings.
[16
The lowest time period for a *samyata-asanyata* (controlled and uncontrolled) being is *antarmuhurt* (a fraction of a moment) in comparison to a single being.
[17
[17
A being who has previously undergone many changes in the *gunasthanas* (stages of development) of *samyama-asanyama* (control and lack of control), such as a *mithyadrishti* (wrong faith), *asanyata samyagdrishti* (uncontrolled right faith), or *pramatta samyata* (distracted and controlled) being with twenty-eight *prakritis* (characteristics) of *mohakarma* (karma of delusion), again attains the *gunasthanas* (stages of development) of *samyama-asanyama* (control and lack of control) due to the results of their actions. If they attain the *samyata-asanyata* (controlled and uncontrolled) *gunasthanas* (stages of development) from the *pramatta samyata* (distracted and controlled) *gunasthanas* (stages of development) with a minimum time period of *antarmuhurt* (a fraction of a moment), then they attain *mithyatva* (wrong faith), *samyagmithyatva* (right and wrong faith), or *asanyata samyaktva* (uncontrolled right faith). However, if they were *mithyadrishti* (wrong faith) or *asanyata samyagdrishti* (uncontrolled right faith) before becoming *samyata-asanyata* (controlled and uncontrolled), then they attain *samyama* (control) with *aprammatta bhava* (non-distracted state of mind). Thus, the lowest time period for the *samyata-asanyata* (controlled and uncontrolled) *gunasthanas* (stages of development) is obtained as described in the scriptures.
The highest time period for the aforementioned *samyata-asanyata* (controlled and uncontrolled) beings is slightly less than *purvakoti* (a very long period of time) in comparison to a single being.

[132] In the six realms, the lifespan of a being is as follows:

[1, 5, 19] A being with five senses and the capacity for perception, such as a fish, turtle, or frog, is born with a limited lifespan. It attains the capacity for perception through all its senses in a very short period of time (1). Then, it rests (2), becomes pure (3), and attains the state of restraint and unrestraint. It remains in this state for a long period of time, known as the "previous koți" (4), and then dies. It is reborn as a deity in the Saudharma Kalpa, and then in other kalpas, such as the Āraṇa and Acyuta kalpas. In these realms, the state of restraint and unrestraint is lost. Thus, the maximum duration of restraint and unrestraint is less than three antarmūhurta periods, which is equivalent to the previous koți.

**How long do beings with restraint and unrestraint last?**

[19] Compared to other beings, they last for a very long time.

[20] Compared to a single being, the shortest duration of restraint and unrestraint is one moment.

The shortest duration of restraint for a being with restraint is as follows: A being with unrestraint, after losing its unrestraint for a short period of time, becomes restrained for one moment. It remains restrained for one moment and then dies, becoming a deity. At this point, the restraint specific to the state of distraction is lost. Thus, the shortest duration of restraint is one moment, as stated in the scriptures.

The shortest duration of unrestraint for a being with unrestraint is as follows: A being with restraint, after losing its restraint for a short period of time, becomes unrestrained for one moment. It remains unrestrained for one moment, along with the state of unrestraint, and then dies, becoming a deity. At this point, the state of unrestraint is lost. Alternatively, a being with unrestraint, descending from the Umashama श्रेणी, becomes unrestrained for one moment, remaining alive for that moment. It then dies and is reborn as a deity in the second moment. Thus, the shortest duration of unrestraint is one moment, which can be attained in two ways.

[21] The longest duration of restraint and unrestraint for a single being is an antarmūhurta.

The longest duration of restraint is as follows: A being with unrestraint becomes restrained for a short period of time and then remains restrained for the maximum duration of an antarmūhurta, attaining the state of falsehood. Thus, the longest duration of restraint is an antarmūhurta.

The longest duration of unrestraint is as follows: A being with restraint becomes unrestrained and remains unrestrained for the maximum duration of an antarmūhurta. Thus, the longest duration of unrestraint is an antarmūhurta.

Kalānugama Oghaniddeso
[133
How long do the four types of Upasamaka Jivas last? Compared to other Jivas, they last for a single moment. || 22 ||
Two or three Upasamaka Jivas who are in the state of Anivrittikarana Upasamaka, and who are descending from the Upasama श्रेणी, become Apurvakarana Gunasthanavarti Upasamaka when only a single moment of their life remains. Afterwards, they remain in that Apurvakarana Gunasthan for a single moment, and then die and become Devas in the second moment. In this way, that single moment of the Apurvakarana Upasamaka becomes the shortest duration. Similarly, the duration of the remaining three Upasamakas should be determined by comparing them to other Jivas. A special point to note is that the duration of the Anivrittikarana and Sukshmasamprayaya Gunasthanavarti Upasamaka Jivas should be determined by considering both ascending and descending Jivas. However, the duration of the Upashantakashay Upasamaka should be determined only by considering ascending Jivas.
The longest duration is Antomuhurta. || 23 || Compared to other Jivas, the longest duration of the four Upasamakas is Antomuhurta. || 23 ||
From seven to eight, up to fifty-four, the Apramattasanyata Jivas all become Apurvakarana Gunasthanavarti Upasamaka simultaneously. Until they attain the Anivrittikarana Gunasthan, other Apramattasanyata Jivas continue to attain the Apurvakarana Gunasthan. Similarly, the Anivrittikarana Gunasthanavarti Upasamakas who are descending from the Upasama श्रेणी should also be made to attain the Apurvakarana Gunasthan. In this way, the Apurvakarana Gunasthan remains for the appropriate longest duration of Antomuhurta, due to the ascending and descending Apurvakarana Upasamaka Jivas, and does not become empty. Similarly, the appropriate longest duration of the other three Upasamakas should be determined. A special point to note is that when determining the longest duration of the Upashantakashay Upasamaka, other Sukshmasamprayayika Sanyata Jivas should be made to ascend to the Upashantakashay Gunasthan until one Upashantakashay Jiva ascends and then descends. In this way, the Upashantakal should be extended by repeatedly making Jivas ascend, until the appropriate longest duration of Antomuhurta is attained.
The shortest duration is a single moment. || 24 || Compared to a single Jiva, the shortest duration of the four Upasamakas is a single moment. || 24 ||
One Anivrittikarana Upasamaka Jiva becomes an Apurvakarana Upasamaka when only a single moment of his life remains, and he remains an Apurvakarana Upasamaka for a single moment, and then attains death in the second moment.

**Six-fold division of the world, the life-span of a being**

[1, 5, 25]

**A being of the highest caste becomes a deva. In this way, its time is only an antarmukha (a very short period of time). In the same way, the time of the other three *upashamaka* (pacifiers) should be considered. The special feature is that the *anivrittikarana* (non-return) and *sukshmasampray* (subtle-stream) *gunasthana* (state of being) *upashamaka* should be considered in both ways (ascending and descending), while the *upashantakshaya* (pacified-affliction) *upashamaka* should be considered only in one way (descending).**

**The highest time for all four *upashamaka* is an antarmukha, in comparison to a single being.** [25]

**For example, a non-negligent, restrained being becomes an *apuurvakarana* (non-previous-action) *gunasthana* *upashamaka*. There, it remains for the highest antarmukha time and attains the *anivrittikarana* *gunasthana*. In this way, this highest time for the *apuurvakarana* is obtained in comparison to a single being. In the same way, the highest time for the other three *upashamaka* should be considered.**

**How long are the four *kshapika* (pacifiers) - *apuurvakarana* and the others, and the *ayogikevali* (non-yogic-kevali)? In comparison to many beings, they are from the lowest to an antarmukha time.** [26]

**Seven, eight, or at most one hundred and eight non-negligent, restrained beings become *apuurvakarana* *gunasthana* *kshapika* after the passage of the *aprammatta* (non-negligent) time, and there, they remain for an antarmukha time and become *anivrittikarana* *kshapika*. In this way, in comparison to many beings, that antarmukha measure of time for the *apuurvakarana* *kshapika* becomes the lowest time. In the same way, the lowest time for the *anivrittikarana*, *sukshmasampray*, and *kshinakshaya* *kshapika*, and the *ayogikevali* should be known.**

**The highest time for all four *kshapika* and the *ayogikevali* is an antarmukha, in comparison to many beings.** [27]

**Seven, eight, or many non-negligent, restrained beings become *apuurvakarana* *gunasthana* *kshapika*, and there, they remain for an antarmukha time and become *anivrittikarana* *gunasthana*. At the same time, other non-negligent, restrained beings become *apuurvakarana* *kshapika*. In this way, with the continuous action of the ascending process, repeated many times, the highest time for the *apuurvakarana* *kshapika* is obtained by taking refuge in many beings. In the same way, the natural time for the remaining three *kshapika* and the *ayogikevali* should be considered.**

**The lowest time for all four *kshapika* and the *ayogikevali* is an antarmukha, in comparison to a single being.** [28]

---------------------------
[1, 5, 32] The duration of the *Oghaniddeso* in *Kalaanugam*
[135] A single *aprammatasanyata* (perfectly restrained) being becomes an *apuurvakaran* (initial) *kshapika* (stage of liberation) and remains there for an *antarmuhurt* (a very short period of time) before becoming an *anivrittikaran* (final) *kshapika*. Thus, the *apuurvakaran* *kshapika* has a *prakrut* (natural) *jghan* (inferior) duration in relation to a single being. Similarly, the durations of the remaining three *kshapikas* and the *ayogikevali* (non-liberated) should be determined.
The *antarmuhurt* is the *utkrusht* (superior) duration of the four *kshapikas* and the *ayogikevali* in relation to a single being. || 29 ||
A single *aprammatasanyata* being becomes an *apuurvakaran* *kshapika*. It remains there for the *sarvotkrusht* (most superior) *antarmuhurt* duration before attaining the *anivrittikaran* *gunasthan* (stage of liberation). This is the *utkrusht* duration of the *apuurvakaran* *kshapika* in relation to a single being. Similarly, the durations of the remaining three *kshapikas* and the *ayogikevali* should be known. Here, both the *jghan* and *utkrusht* durations are the same because it is not possible to imitate the *prakrut* results of *apuurvakaran* etc.
How long do the *sayogikevali* (liberated) Jinas exist? They exist for all durations in relation to different beings. || 30 ||
This is because there is not a single moment in any of the three durations when the *sayogikevali* Jinas are not found. Therefore, they are said to exist for all durations here.
The *jghan* duration of the *sayogikevali* in relation to a single being is an *antarmuhurt*. || 31 ||
A single being in the *kshinakashaya* (diminished passions) *gunasthan* becomes a *sayogikevali* and remains there for an *antarmuhurt* duration. After that, it becomes an *ayogikevali* by attaining *yoganirodh* (cessation of karmic activity) through *samudhat* (effort). Thus, the *sayogikevali* Jinas have a *jghan* duration as stated in the scriptures in relation to a single being.
The *utkrusht* duration of the *sayogikevali* in relation to a single being is slightly less than a *purvakoti* (a very long period of time) years. || 32 ||
A single *kshayikasamyagdristi* (perfectly enlightened) deva (god) or naraki (hell being) is born among humans who have a lifespan of a *purvakoti* years. It remains in the womb for seven months and attains *samyama* (restraint) with *aprammat* (perfect mindfulness) at the age of eight years from the day of its birth, which is the day it entered the womb (1). After that, it undergoes thousands of transformations related to the *pramat* (mindfulness) and *aprammat* *sanyata* *gunasthan* (stages of restraint) (2), and then it undergoes *adhapravrittikaran* (downward movement) in the *aprammatasanyata* *gunasthan* (3). It then gradually becomes an *apuurvakaran* (4), *anivrittikaran* (5), *sukshmasampray* (subtle) *kshapika* (6), and then a *kshinakashaya* (diminished passions), *vitraga* (passionless), *chhadmastha* (hidden) being (7), and finally becomes a *sayogikevali* (8). It then remains in this *sayogikevali* state for eight years and a *purvakoti* duration minus seven *antarmuhurts* before becoming an *ayogikevali*. Thus, eight years and...

In the six-fold world, the duration of the lifespan of a being
[1, 5, 33]
Less than eight antarmūhūrta, the excellent time of the yogic kevali is available. According to the order, in the translation of the Gadiyanuvada, how long do the mithyadṛṣṭi beings in the hellish realm remain? In comparison to various beings, they remain for all time. || 33 ||
In comparison to one being, the least time of a hellish mithyadṛṣṭi is one antarmūhūrta. || 34 ||
It is as follows: A being who has attained mithyatva many times in the past, such a samyagmithyadṛṣṭi or asamyatasamyagdṛṣṭi being, having completed the saṃkleśa, becomes a mithyadṛṣṭi. There, he remains for the least time of one antarmūhūrta, and becoming pure, attains samyaktva or samyagmithyatva. Thus, the least time of a hellish mithyadṛṣṭi is one antarmūhūrta.
In comparison to one being, the excellent time of a hellish mithyadṛṣṭi is thirty sāgaropam. || 35 ||
A tiryanc or a human being is born in the seventh earth. There, he remains for thirty sāgaropam with mithyatva, and attains a different state. Thus, the excellent time of a hellish mithyadṛṣṭi is thirty sāgaropam.
The saṣādanasamyakdṛṣṭi and samyagmithyadṛṣṭi hellish beings, in comparison to various beings and one being, have a least and excellent time equal to the ogh. || 36 ||

How long do the hellish asamyatasamyagdṛṣṭi beings remain? In comparison to various beings, they remain for all time. || 37 ||

[1, 5, 47] In the Kalpa Sutra, the duration of the lifespan of the *mithyadrishti* (false-believing) beings in hell is described.

[137] From the first to the seventh earth, how long do the *mithyadrishti* beings in hell live? Compared to many beings, they live for all time. [40]

Compared to a single being, the shortest lifespan of the *mithyadrishti* beings in hell on the aforementioned earths is only an *antarmuhurt* (a fraction of a moment). [41]

The longest lifespan of the *mithyadrishti* beings in hell on the aforementioned seven earths is, in order, one, three, seven, ten, seventeen, twenty-two, and thirty-three *sagaropama* (as vast as an ocean). [42]

This longest lifespan should be understood in accordance with the longest lifespan of the hell beings on the intended earth.

The lifespan of the *sasadan* (those who have attained the right faith) and *samyagmithyadrishti* (those who have attained the right faith but have not yet attained liberation) beings on the seven earths, compared to many beings and a single being, is like a *ogh* (a stream). [43]

How long do the *asanyata* (uncontrolled) *samyagmithyadrishti* beings in hell on the seven earths live? Compared to many beings, they live for all time. [44]

Compared to a single being, the shortest lifespan of the *asanyata* *samyagmithyadrishti* beings in hell on the seven earths is an *antarmuhurt*. [45]

The longest lifespan of the *asanyata* *samyagmithyadrishti* beings in hell on the seven earths is, in order, slightly less than one, three, seven, ten, seventeen, twenty-two, and thirty-three *sagaropama*. [46]

Here, the term "slightly less" refers to the three *antarmuhurt* related to the completion, rest, and purification of the *paryapti* (perfection) from the first to the seventh earth, and the six *antarmuhurt* on the seventh earth (according to Sutra 39).

In the *tirikha* (animal) realm, how long do the *mithyadrishti* beings live? Compared to many beings, they live for all time. [47]

Here, the Ogh should be understood as follows: the maximum lifespan of the three types of humans, from the Sanjat and Asanjat, is one Purvakoti less than eight years, from the birth of Yoninishkraman. This is because, just as Tiryanch beings can take Anuvratas in an Antarmuhurta after being born, none of the three types of humans can take Anuvratas in an Antarmuhurta, but they can take Anuvratas only after they are eight years old from the birth of Yoninishkraman.

[144] In the six realms, the lifespan of a being is as follows:

[1, 5, 103]

[102]

In the nine directional vimanas, the shortest lifespan of a being is thirty-one sagaropamas, and in the four anuttara vimanas, it is thirty-two sagaropamas. [103]

There is no change in the guna-sthana in these vimanas, because there is no possibility of any other guna-sthana except the guna-sthana of asanyata-samyag-drishti. Here, the measure of saadhikatva should be understood as a single time, because, according to the Acharya tradition, the superior state of the devatas residing in the lower vimanas is the inferior state of the devatas residing in the higher vimanas.

The longest lifespan in the aforementioned vimanas is thirty-two sagaropamas and thirty-three sagaropamas respectively. [104]

The longest lifespan in the nine directional vimanas is thirty-two sagaropamas, and in the four anuttara vimanas, it is thirty-three sagaropamas.

How long do the devatas residing in the Sarvarthasiddhi vimana live, who have asanyata-samyag-drishti? They live for all time, compared to the lifespan of various beings. [105]

The shortest and longest lifespan of a being in the Sarvarthasiddhi vimana is thirty-three sagaropamas. [106]

According to the Indriyamargna, how long do the ekendriya beings live? They live for all time, compared to the lifespan of various beings. [107]

The shortest lifespan of an ekendriya being is the amount of time it takes to grasp a kshudra-bhava. [108]

[148] In the Chakshandagama, the lifespans of the Jivas (living beings)
[1, 5, 142] The coarse (bādar) plants, aqueous (āu), fiery (teu), aerial (vāu), and vegetable (vanapphadikāiya) individual-bodied Jivas, how long do they live? They live for the same duration as other Jivas. [142]
The minimum duration of these Jivas is the duration of the acquisition of a minute (khudda) existence (bhava). [143] The maximum duration of these Jivas is the duration of the karmic state (kammahidī). [144]
Here, one should understand that the maximum state of the seventy koḍākoḍī sāgaropama duration of the perception-deluding (darshanmoha) karma is to be grasped.
The coarse (bādar) earth-bodied (puḍhavikāiya), coarse water-bodied (āukāiya), coarse fire-bodied (teu-kāiya), coarse air-bodied (vāu-kāiya), and coarse plant-bodied (vanapphadikāiya) individual-bodied Jivas, how long do they live? They live for the same duration as other Jivas. [145]
The minimum duration of these Jivas is the duration of an antarmuhūrta (less than 48 minutes). [146] The maximum duration of these Jivas is countless thousands of years. [147]
Among them, the maximum lifespan of the pure earth-bodied (pūḍhavikāiya) Jivas is twelve thousand (12,000) years, the lifespan of the rough earth-bodied (khara-puḍhavikāiya) Jivas is twenty-two thousand (22,000) years, the lifespan of the water-bodied (āukāiya) Jivas is seven thousand (7,000) years, the lifespan of the fire-bodied (teu-kāiya) Jivas is three (3) days, the lifespan of the air-bodied (vāu-kāiya) Jivas is three thousand (3,000) years, and the lifespan of the plant-bodied (vanapphadikāiya) Jivas is ten thousand (10,000) years. In these lifespans, after being born countless thousands of times, they become countless thousands of years. Just as an Ajīva (non-living) bodied Jiva was born among the Jīva (living) bodied Jivas, and then it wandered among those same Jīva bodied Jivas for countless thousands of years until it attained the Ajīva body. In this way, one should understand the maximum duration of the Jīva bodied Jivas.
The coarse (bādar) earth-bodied (puḍhavikāiya), coarse water-bodied (āukāiya), coarse fire-bodied (teu-kāiya), coarse air-bodied (vāu-kāiya), and coarse plant-bodied (vanapphadikāiya) individual-bodied Jivas with limited (laddh'appajjatta) capacity, how long do they live? They live for the same duration as other Jivas. [148]

##  Chapter 150: The Duration of Life in the Six Realms

[1, 5, 159] The duration of life for the **Sakaayika** (those with false faith) and **Mithyaadrishti** (those with false belief) is more than two thousand **Saagaropama** (ocean-like) periods, while the duration of life for the **Trasakaayika** (those with three bodies) and **Trasakaayika Paryaptak** (those with three bodies and sufficient merit) is exactly two thousand **Saagaropama** periods. || 159 ||

From **Saasadan Samyagdristi** (those with right faith) to **Ayogikaevali** (those who have attained liberation without effort), the duration of life for the **Trasakaayika** and **Trasakaayika Paryaptak** is like a **Ogh** (stream). || 160 ||

The duration of life for the **Trasakaayika Labdhya Paryaptak** (those with three bodies and attained merit) is the same as the duration of life for the **Panchendriya Labdhya Paryaptak** (those with five senses and attained merit). || 161 ||

According to the **Yoganuvaad** (the path of yoga), how long do the **Panchamanoyogi** (those with five mental yogas) and **Panchavachanyogi** (those with five verbal yogas) live, including **Mithyaadrishti**, **Asanjad Samyagdristi**, **Sanjad Asanjad**, **Prammat Sanjad**, **Apprammat Sanjad**, and **Sayogikaevali**? The duration of life for each of these beings is different. || 162 ||

Compared to a single being, the shortest duration of life for the aforementioned beings is one **Samaya** (moment). || 163 ||

The statement that the shortest duration of life for the **Panchamanoyogi** and **Panchavachanyogi** beings, including **Mithyaadrishti** and **Asanjad Samyagdristi**, is only one **Samaya** should be understood in relation to **Yogaparivartan** (change in yoga), **Gunasthanaparivartan** (change in state of being), **Maran** (death), and **Vyaaghat** (obstacle). For example, in relation to **Yogaparivartan**, a **Saasadan Samyagdristi** being was practicing **Manoyoga** (mental yoga). When only one **Samaya** remained of his **Manoyoga** period, he became **Mithyaadrishti**. After that, he remained **Mithyaadrishti** and became **Vachanyogi** (verbal yoga) or **Kayayogi** (physical yoga). Thus, in relation to **Yogaparivartan**, the shortest duration of life for a **Manoyogi Mithyaadrishti** being is only one **Samaya**.

In relation to **Gunasthanaparivartan**, a **Mithyaadrishti** being was practicing **Vachanyoga** or **Kayayoga**. When his **Vachanyoga** or **Kayayoga** period was nearing its end, he became **Manoyogi**. He remained **Manoyogi** with **Mithyaadrishti** for one **Samaya**, and in the second **Samaya**, he became **Samyagmithyaadrishti** (right false belief) or **Asanjam** (uncontrolled) with **Samyagdristi** (right belief) or **Sanjatasanjat** (controlled uncontrolled) or **Apprammat** (non-distracted) with **Sanjat** (controlled). Thus, in relation to **Gunasthanaparivartan**, the shortest duration of life for a **Manoyogi Mithyaadrishti** being is only one **Samaya**.

A **Mithyaadrishti** being was practicing **Vachanyoga** or **Kayayoga**. When his **Vachanyoga** or **Kayayoga** period was nearing its end, he became **Manoyogi**. He remained **Manoyogi** with **Mithyaadrishti** for one **Samaya**, and in the second **Samaya**, he became **Samyagmithyaadrishti** (right false belief) or **Asanjam** (uncontrolled) with **Samyagdristi** (right belief) or **Sanjatasanjat** (controlled uncontrolled) or **Apprammat** (non-distracted) with **Sanjat** (controlled). Thus, in relation to **Gunasthanaparivartan**, the shortest duration of life for a **Manoyogi Mithyaadrishti** being is only one **Samaya**.

[151] If a being who is about to die in the second time period is reborn in the realm of animals or humans, it becomes a Kārmāṇakāyayogi or Audārikamishrakāyayogi. If it is reborn in the realm of gods or hell beings, it becomes a Kārmāṇakāyayogi or Vaikriyikamishrakāyayogi. Thus, in comparison to death, the inferior time period for a Manoyogi Mithyādṛṣṭi is as stated in the sūtras.
If a Mithyādṛṣṭi being was in a state of Vacyayoga or Kāyayoga, and these yogas were destroyed, it became a Manoyogi and remained a Mithyādṛṣṭi for one time period. Later, in the second time period, it attained Vyāghāta and became a Kāyayogi, remaining a Mithyādṛṣṭi. Thus, in comparison to Vyāghāta, the inferior time period for a Manoyogi Mithyādṛṣṭi is only one time period. Similarly, one should understand as much as possible that the inferior time period for Mithyādṛṣṭi, Asamyatasamyagdṛṣṭi, Samyatāsampat, Pramattasamyat, Apramattasamyat, and Sayogikevaloka, in comparison to any of the five Manoyogas and the five Manoyogas, is only one time period. It is important to know that there is no possibility of Vyāghāta for Apramattasamyat.

[1,5,250] In the Kalānugam, the duration of the Kṣayāmargaṇā (the path of destruction) is as follows:

[159] For a single Jīva, the lowest duration of a Napumsakavedī with Mithyādrṣṭi (false belief) is an Antarmūhurta (a fraction of a Muhurta). [241]

[242] Compared to a single Jīva, the highest duration of the aforementioned Jīvas is an infinite duration, equivalent to an immeasurable number of Pudgala transformations.

[243] The duration of a Napumsakavedī with Sāsādanasamyakdrṣṭi (right belief with attachment) is like a stream.

[244] The duration of a Napumsakavedī with Samyagmithyādrṣṭi (mixed belief) is like a stream.

[245] How long does a Napumsakavedī with Asanjadasamyakdrṣṭi (uncontrolled right belief) last? Compared to various Jīvas, it lasts for all time.

[246] For a single Jīva, the lowest duration of a Napumsakavedī with Asanjadasamyakdrṣṭi is an Antarmūhurta.

[247] Compared to a single Jīva, the highest duration of the aforementioned Napumsakavedī with Asanjadasamyakdrṣṭi is slightly less (six Antarmūhurtas less) than thirty-three oceans.

[248] The duration of a Napumsakavedī from the Sanjatāsanjatā (controlled-uncontrolled) state to the Anivṛttikaraṇa (non-return) Guṇasthāna (state of being) is like a stream.

[249] The duration of a Jīva from the Anivṛttikaraṇa Guṇasthāna in the Apagatavedī (those who have lost their knowledge) to the Ayogikakevalī (non-perfect omniscient) Guṇasthāna is like a stream.

[250] According to the Kṣayāmargaṇā, the duration of a Jīva from the Mithyādrṣṭi Guṇasthāna to the Aprammatasanjatā (perfectly controlled) Guṇasthāna, in the case of those with Krodhakṣayī (anger-prone), Mānakṣayī (pride-prone), Māyakṣayī (deceitful), and Lobhakṣayī (greedy) Kṣayās (afflictions), is like that of a Manoyogi (one who has attained mental control).

## The Sixfold Division of the Universe: The Life Span of a Being

[1, 6, 3
When a being is prevented from entering a state, that prevention is not due to the absence of that state, but rather to the presence of another state. To illustrate this point, we have continuously used the term "interval." The meaning is that a being with false belief exists for all time.
170]

**A single being's interval is as short as a single moment.** [3]

A being with false belief, through the causes of its transformations, repeatedly experiences the states of right and false belief, right conduct and wrong conduct, and restraint and unrestraint. It attains right belief and then, after a very short interval, it attains false belief. Thus, the interval between a being's false belief is as short as a single moment.

**Compared to a single being, the interval of a being with false belief is as long as two sixty-six oceans.** [4]

A certain animal or human being is born in the realm of the Lāntava-Kapishtha gods, who have a lifespan of fourteen oceans. After spending one ocean in that realm, it attains right belief in the first moment of the second ocean. It then remains in right belief for thirteen oceans and then, while still in right belief, it is reborn as a human being. In that human life, it practices restraint or unrestraint and is reborn in the realm of the Āraṇa-Acyuta gods, who have a lifespan of twenty-two oceans, which is less than the lifespan of a human being. From there, it is reborn as a human being again. In that human life, it practices restraint and is reborn in the realm of the Graiveyaka gods, who have a lifespan of thirty-one oceans, which is less than the lifespan of a human being. It is reborn in the realm of the Ahmiṃdra gods, who have a lifespan of thirty-one oceans, which is less than the lifespan of a human being. There, in the last moment of an interval of sixty-six oceans, it becomes a being with right and false belief due to the causes of its transformations. It remains in that state for a moment and then attains right belief again, rests, and is reborn as a human being. In that human life, it practices restraint or unrestraint and is reborn in the realm of the Ānata-Prāṇata gods, who have a lifespan of twenty oceans, which is less than the lifespan of a human being. Then, in succession, it is reborn in the realms of gods who have lifespans of twenty-two and twenty-four oceans, which are less than the lifespan of a human being. In the last moment of an interval of two sixty-six oceans, it attains false belief. Thus, the interval of false belief is two sixty-six oceans (13 + 22 + 31 = 66, 20 + 22 + 24 = 66).

This sequence of births described above is meant to explain the concept of interval to ordinary people. In reality, the interval can be completed in any way.

What is the interval between Sāsādana Samyagdṛṣṭi and Samyagmithyādṛṣṭi Jivas? In comparison to the various Jivas, it is only one moment. || 5 ||

The interval between Sāsādana Samyagdṛṣṭi - Starting with two Jivas, and increasing by one each time, an innumerable number of parts of a Palya-Upamā is the time it takes for a Upaśama Samyagdṛṣṭi Jiva to attain the Upaśama Samyaktva. Starting from one moment, and leaving a remainder of up to six Āvali Kalas, the Sāsādana Guṇasthāna is attained. For the same amount of time that the Upaśama Samyaktva was left, they all attained Mithyātva, remaining in the Sāsādana Guṇasthāna. In this way, the Sāsādana Samyagdṛṣṭis were absent from all three worlds for one moment. Then, in the second moment, another seven, eight, or an innumerable part of an Āvali, or an innumerable part of a Palya-Upamā, Upaśama Samyagdṛṣṭi Jivas attained the Sāsādana Guṇasthāna. In this way, the minimum interval of the Sāsādana Guṇasthāna is one moment.

The minimum interval of the Samyagmithyādṛṣṭi Guṇasthāna is as follows: Seven, eight, or many Samyagmithyādṛṣṭi Jivas attained Samyaktva or Mithyātva, all at once, when the time related to their Samyagmithyātva, in comparison to the various Jivas, had diminished. Then, for one moment, the Samyagmithyādṛṣṭi Jivas were absent from all three worlds. After that, in the next moment, seven, eight, or many Mithyādṛṣṭi or Samyagdṛṣṭi Jivas attained Samyagmithyātva. In this way, the minimum interval of Samyagmithyātva, in comparison to the various Jivas, is only one moment.

Ukkassena palidovamassa asankhejdibhago. || 6 ||

The maximum interval of the two aforementioned Guṇasthāna Jivas, in comparison to the various Jivas, is an innumerable part of a Palya-Upamā. || 6 ||

The maximum interval of Sāsādana Samyagdṛṣṭi - Seven, eight, or many Upaśama Samyagdṛṣṭi Jivas attained the Sāsādana Guṇasthāna. In this way, through the cycle of increase and decrease, the flow of the Sāsādana Guṇasthāna continued for an innumerable part of a Palya-Upamā, due to those Sāsādana Samyagdṛṣṭi Jivas. Then, in the next moment, all those Jivas attained Mithyātva. For an innumerable part of a Palya-Upamā, the Sāsādana Guṇasthāna was not present in anyone. Then, after that maximum interval of an innumerable part of a Palya-Upamā, in the next moment, seven, eight, or many Upaśama Samyagdṛṣṭi Jivas attained the aforementioned Sāsādana Guṇasthāna. In this way, the maximum interval of the Sāsādana Guṇasthāna is an innumerable part of a Palya-Upamā.

## Chapter 172: The Interval of Life in the Six Realms

**[1, 6, 7]**

**The Interval of the Right and Wrong Viewers:**

When the time of Right and Wrong View has passed, all Right and Wrong Viewers attain either Right View or Wrong View. In this way, the interval of the Right and Wrong View Gunasthan is attained. Again, only an immeasurable fraction of a Palyopam, after an infinite time of the interval of the highest, the Wrong Viewers with the existence of the twenty-eight natures of the Moh Karma, or the Vedak Samyakdrishti, or the Upsham Samyakdrishti, attain Right or Wrong View. In this way, the interval of the Right and Wrong View Gunasthan is attained, which is an immeasurable fraction of a Palyopam.

**[7]**

**The Interval of the Sasadan Samyakdrishti and the Right and Wrong Viewers:**

The lowest interval of the Sasadan Samyakdrishti and the Right and Wrong Viewers is an immeasurable fraction of a Palyopam and an Antarmuhurt respectively.

**The Interval of the Sasadan Samyakdrishti:**

A Sasadan Samyakdrishti, who has returned from Upsham Samyaktv, remains in the Sasadan Gunasthan for some time and then attains Wrong View, thus attaining the interval. After that, in a time of only an immeasurable fraction of a Palyopam, he attains Upsham Samyaktv again. When six Avali periods remain in the time of Upsham Samyaktv, he attains the Sasain Gunasthan. In this way, the interval of the Sasain Gunasthan is attained, which is an immeasurable fraction of a Palyopam.

**The Interval of the Right and Wrong Viewers:**

A Right and Wrong Viewer attains the interval by attaining Wrong View or Right View due to the effects of the Karmas. After an Antarmuhurt, he attains Right and Wrong View again. In this way, he attains the interval, which is an Antarmuhurt.

**[8]**

**The Highest Interval of the Two Gunasthan:**

The highest interval of the two Gunasthan mentioned above, in comparison to a single being, is slightly less than half a Pudgal Parivartan.

**The Highest Interval of the Sasadan Gunasthan:**

An Anadi Wrong Viewer, after performing the three Karmas of Adhopravritti, etc., attains Upsham Samyaktv for the first time. He performs an infinite number of Pudgal Parivartans in the cycle of existence. After that, he remains in Samyaktv for an Antarmuhurt and attains Sasadan Samyaktv. (1) Then, he attains Wrong View, thus attaining the interval. He wanders in Wrong View for a time slightly less than half a Pudgal Parivartan. When only an Antarmuhurt remains in the cycle of existence, he attains Upsham Samyaktv. After that, when only one period remains in the time of Upsham Samyaktv, he attains the Sasain Gunasthan. In this way, the interval mentioned in the sutra is attained. After that, he becomes a Wrong Viewer again. (2) Then, he attains Vedak Samyaktv. (3) He disconnects the Anadibandhi Kashayas. (4) He destroys the Darshan Mohaniya. (5) He becomes Aprammat Samyata. (6) Then...

In this way, an interval of less than fourteen Antarmuhuratas and more than half a Pudgal Parivartan is obtained by the Sasadan Samyagdristika.
The Samyagmithyadristika, that excellent interval - a being with Anadi Mithyadristi, having undergone all three Karmas, attained the Uparanasamyaktva and in the first moment of attaining it, completed an infinite number of Samsara Pudgal Parivartanas. Then, staying for an Antarmuhurta with Upshama Samyaktva (1), he became Samyagmithyatva (2). Again, attaining Mithyatva, he attained the interval. Afterwards, he wandered for the duration of an Artha Pudgal Parivartan, and when only an Antarmuhurta of Samsara remained, he attained Upshama Samyaktva and there, by destroying the Anantanu bandhi Kshaya, he attained Samyagmithyatva. In this way, he attained the interval (3). After that, attaining Vedaka Samyaktva (4), he destroyed the Darshanamohaniya (5) and became Aprammatta (6). Again, by undergoing thousands of reflections related to the Prammatta and Aprammatta Gunasthanas (7), becoming purified by the purity of the Kshapaka Shreni (8), becoming the Apurvakarana Kshapaka (9), the Anivrittikarana Kshapaka (10), the Sukshma Samparayika Kshapaka (11), the Kshina Kshaya (12), the Sayoga Kevali (13) and the Ayoga Kevali (14), he attained the Siddha Pada. In this way, an interval of less than fourteen Antarmuhuratas and more than half a Pudgal Parivartan is obtained by the Samyagmithyatva.

**In the six realms, the lifespan of a living being**

[1, 6, 11]

The interval between the attainment of restraint and non-restraint is obtained. Similarly, the interval between the attainment of restrained and unrestrained, as per the sutras, is obtained as the minimum interval. The interval between the restrained and unrestrained - a restrained living being becomes unrestrained and again becomes restrained in the shortest possible time. Thus, the interval between the restrained and unrestrained is obtained as the minimum interval. The interval between the unrestrained and unrestrained - an unrestrained living being ascends to the stage of cessation and returns from there and again becomes unrestrained. Thus, the interval between the unrestrained and unrestrained is obtained as the minimum interval.

**The interval of the highest order is less than half a pudgala-parivartana.** [11]

Compared to a single living being, the interval of the highest order for the living beings in the four stages of non-restrained right faith, etc., is less than half a pudgala-parivartana. [11]

The interval of the highest order for a non-restrained right faith living being - an eternal false faith living being, after performing the three karmas, attains the first stage of cessation right faith, cuts through the infinite cycle of existence, and before attaining right faith, performs only half a pudgala-parivartana. Again, he remains in the stage of cessation right faith for an antarmukhurta period (1) and after the remaining time of six avalis in that period, attains the stage of sasadan guna-sthana and obtains the interval. Again, he wanders for half a pudgala-parivartana period with false faith and in the last birth, attains restraint or restraint-non-restraint and becomes a perfect knower with cessation right faith and after the remaining time of the cycle of existence of an antarmukhurta period, becomes non-restrained right faith due to the causes of the results. Thus, the interval as per the sutras is obtained (2). Again, he attains restraint with non-distraction (3) and after performing thousands of reversals in the stages of distracted and non-distracted (4), becomes purified with the purity suitable for the stage of kshapaka (5) and becomes an a-purva-karana kshapaka (6), an a-nivritti-karana kshapaka (7), a sukshma-samparaya kshapaka (8), a kshina-kashaya-vita-raga-chhadmastha (9), a sayoga-kevali (10) and an a-yoga-kevali (11) and attains liberation. Thus, compared to a single living being, the interval of the highest order for the non-restrained right faith living beings is half a pudgala-parivartana period from these eleven antarmukhurtas. Similarly, one should understand this interval of the highest order for the restrained-unrestrained, distracted-restrained and non-distracted-restrained living beings with their own specific characteristics.

**How long is the interval between the four cessations? It is only one moment compared to the lifespan of various living beings.** [12]

Seven, eight or many living beings, after the a-purva-karana cessation period becomes weak, become a-nivritti-karana cessation or non-distracted-restrained and attain death and become gods. Thus, the interval of the a-purva-karana guna-sthana is obtained for one moment. Afterwards, in the second moment, the non-distracted-restrained...

1. In the sequence of internal subsidence, the description of the subsidence stages is as follows:

[175]
Or, the non-returning (anivṛttikara ṇa) subsidence-suppressing (upashamaka) living beings who were in the stage of the non-origination (apūrvakaraṇa) attained the subsidence-suppressing (upashamaka) stage. In this way, the minimum interval period (antara kāla) of the stage of the non-origination (apūrvakaraṇa) subsidence-suppressing (upashamaka) was obtained with respect to various living beings. Similarly, one should know the minimum interval period of the non-returning (anivṛttikara ṇa) subsidence-suppressing (upashamaka), the subtle-contemplative (sūkṣmasāmpara yika) subsidence-suppressing (upashamaka), and the subsidence-suppressed passions (upashānta kasāya) subsidence-suppressing (upashamaka).

13. The maximum interval (vāsapṛthaktva) of the above four subsidence-suppressing (upashamaka) stages is only the difference of years.

Certain seven, eight, or many non-origination (apūrvakaraṇa) subsidence-suppressing (upashamaka) living beings became non-returning (anivṛttikara ṇa) subsidence-suppressing (upashamaka) or vigilant-restrained (apramattasaṃyata) and died to become deities. In this way, the maximum interval (vāsapṛthaktva) for the stage of the non-origination (apūrvakaraṇa) subsidence-suppressing (upashamaka) was obtained. Thereafter, after the lapse of the period of the difference of years, certain seven, eight, or many vigilant-restrained (apramattasaṃyata) living beings became non-origination (apūrvakaraṇa) subsidence-suppressing (upashamaka). In this way, that maximum interval (vāsapṛthaktva) was obtained for the non-origination (apūrvakaraṇa) subsidence-suppressing (upashamaka). Similarly, one should know the interval (vāsapṛthaktva) for the remaining three subsidence-suppressing (upashamaka) stages.

14. The minimum interval (antarmuhūrta) of the four subsidence-suppressing (upashamaka) stages with respect to one living being is antarmuhūrta.

15. The maximum interval (vāsapṛthaktva) of the above four subsidence-suppressing (upashamaka) stages with respect to one living being is slightly less than half a paudgalika transformation (ardhapaudgalikapariv ṛtti).

##  Translation:

[176] In the six-fold world, the lifespan of a being is as follows:

[1, 6, 16] The *kṣaya* (9), followed by *sūkṣma-sāmprāya* (10), *anivṛttikaraṇa* (11), and *apūrva-karaṇa* (12) become *guṇa-sthāna* (quality-stage) holders. Subsequently, they fall down and attain the *antara* (intermediate state). After traversing for a period of time less than half the *pūdgala-parivartana-kāla* (time of matter transformation), they attain the final existence and destroy the three natures of *darśana-mohaniya* (knowledge-obscuring) in the final existence, and the *apūrva-karaṇa* becomes *upaśāmaka* (subduer). (13) Thus, the *antara* is attained. Again, *anivṛttikaraṇa* (14), *sūkṣma-sāmprāya* (15), and *upaśānta-kṣaya* (16) become *upaśāmaka*. Again, they return and become *sūkṣma-sāmprāya* (17), *anivṛttikaraṇa* (18), *apūrva-karaṇa* (19), *apramatta-saṃyata* (20), *pramatta-saṃyata* (21), again *apramatta-saṃyata* (22), *apūrva-karaṇa-kṣapaka* (23), *anivṛttikaraṇa-kṣapaka* (24), *sūkṣma-sāmprāya-kṣapaka* (25), *kṣīṇa-kṣaya* (26), *sayoga-kevali* (27), and *ayoga-kevali* (28), and attain *nirvāṇa* (liberation). Thus, the *apūrva-karaṇa* attains the highest *antara* in less than twenty-eight *antar-muhūrta* (moments) of half the *pūdgala-parivartana* time.

Similarly, one should know the *antara* of the other three *upaśāmaka*. The peculiarity is that, in the order of the *paripāṭi-krama* (order of practice), the *anivṛttikaraṇa* *upaśāmaka* has a highest *antara* of less than twenty-six *antar-muhūrta* of half the *pūdgala-parivartana* time, the *sūkṣma-sāmprāya* *upaśāmaka* has a highest *antara* of less than twenty-four *antar-muhūrta* of half the *pūdgala-parivartana* time, and the *upaśānta-kṣaya* *upaśāmaka* has a highest *antara* of less than twenty-two *antar-muhūrta* of half the *pūdgala-parivartana* time.

[16] How long is the *antara* of the four *kṣapaka* and the *ayoga-kevali*? It is one *samaya* (time) for the lowest among the various beings.

Seven, eight, or at most one hundred and eight *apūrva-karaṇa* *kṣapaka* all become *anivṛttikaraṇa* *kṣapaka* at the same time. Thus, for one *samaya*, the *apūrva-karaṇa* *guṇa-sthāna* is absent. Subsequently, in the second *samaya*, seven, eight, or one hundred and eight *apramatta-saṃyata* become *apūrva-karaṇa* *kṣapaka* together. Thus, that lowest *antara* is attained for one *samaya*. Similarly, one should know the *antara-kāla* (time of *antara*) of the remaining three *kṣapaka* as one *samaya*.

[17] The highest *antara-kāla* of the four *kṣapaka* and the *ayoga-kevali* is six months for the various beings.

Seven, eight, or one hundred and eight *apūrva-karaṇa* *kṣapaka* beings become *anivṛttikaraṇa* *kṣapaka*. Then, for six months, the *apūrva-karaṇa* *guṇa-sthāna* is absent due to the highest *utkarṣa* (excellence). Subsequently, seven, eight, or one hundred and eight *apramatta-saṃyata* beings become *apūrva-karaṇa* *kṣapaka*. Thus, that highest *antara* of six months is attained for the *apūrva-karaṇa* *kṣapaka*. Similarly, the highest *antara* of six months is attained for the remaining *guṇa-sthāna*.

In relation to one jīva, the excellence of differences among ānathapraṇata (life-force) beings, āraṇa (a particular category) beings, and deities of the nine Graiveyakas with mithyādṛṣṭi and asamyat-samyak-dṛṣṭi is found to be somewhat less than twenty, twenty-two, twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty, and thirty-one sāgaropama (sea-like measures). 

*Sāsaṇasammādihi-sammāmicchādiṭṭhiṇaṁ sattāṇamohaṁ.* (98)
Among the aforementioned ānatha and other deities, the differences between sāsādanasamyak-dṛṣṭi and samyak-mithyādṛṣṭi deities are similar to śvādhi (a specific rank of being). 

*Anudisaādi jāva savvattasiddhivimānavāsiyadevesu asamjadasammādhiṭṭhiṇaṁ kaʹvicchiraṁ kālādo hodi? Nānājīvaṁ paḍucca naṭṭhi antarṁ, niyantaram.* (99)
From the perspective of the anudisa (the first type of heavenly beings) to the sarvārtha-siddhi (fulfillment for all), how long is the duration of the differences among those having asamyat-samyak-dṛṣṭi deities? There is continuously no difference concerning various lives.

*Eka jīvam paḍucca naṭṭhi antarṁ, niyantaram.* (100)
Compared to one jīva, in those deities, there is no difference; it is continuous.

The reason for this is that among these anudisa and other heavenly beings, it is only possible for one to have an asamyat-quality-position, thus it is not feasible for them to move to another quality-position. 

*Indriyānuvādeṇa eindriyāṇamantāṁ kaʹvicchiraṁ kālādo hodi? Nānājīvaṁ paḍucca naṭṭhi antarṁ, niyantaram.* (101)
In the context of the translation of indriya (senses), how long is the difference among one-indriyas? There is no difference concerning various lives; it is continuous. 

*Eka jīvam paḍucca jahāṇṇa khuddābhavagghaṇaṁ.* (102)
In comparison to one jīva, the great difference among the one-indriyas is merely the grasp of trivial existence. 

*Ukkasseṇa ve sāgarovama-sahassāṇi puvakoṭipudhattheṇabbharīyāṇi.* (103)
In comparison to one jīva, the excellence of differences among one-indriyas is more than two thousand from the standpoint of previous-class distinction.

7. Bhavanugam
-
dakarta
There are two types of descriptions in the Bhavanugam - the description of the flow and the description of the order. || 1 ||
There are four types of Bhavas in terms of name, establishment, substance and feeling. Among them, the 'Bhava' word which is not related to the external meaning but is active in itself is called Namabhava. Establishment Bhava is of two types - Sadbhava and Asadbhava. Among them, the establishment which is done by imitating the Vitaraga and Saraga Bhavas is called Sadbhava-sthapanabhava. The opposite of this is Asadbhava-sthapanabhava.
Dravyabhava is of two types - Agam and Noagam. Among these, the being who is the knower of the Bhava-prabhut but is devoid of use in the present context is called Agam-dravyabhava. Noagam-dravyabhava is of three types - knower-body, future and other than that. Among them, the knower-body Noagam-dravyabhava is of three types - future, present and understood. The body which will be the basis of the being who will be transformed by the future Bhava-prabhut Paryaya is called the future Noagam-knower-body Dravyabhava. The body which is becoming one with the being who has been transformed by the Bhava-prabhut Paryaya is called the present Noagam-knower-body Dravyabhava. The body which has become one with the being who has been transformed by the Bhava-prabhut Paryaya and has become separate is called the understood Noagam-knower-body Dravyabhava. The being who will be transformed in the future by the Bhava-prabhut Paryaya is called the future Noagam-dravyabhava. The other than that Noagam-dravyabhava is of three types - conscious, unconscious and mixed. Among them, the being-substance is the conscious other than that Noagam-dravyabhava. Pudgal, Dharma, Adharma, Kala and Akash these five substances are the unconscious other than that Noagam-bhava. The combination of Pudgal and being-substance which has attained the state of Jatyantar in some way is called the mixed other than that Noagam-dravyabhava.

---------------------------
[216] In the six-fold division of the universe, the state of the living being (Jiva) is of two types: *Aagam* and *No-Aagam*. *Aagam* is of two types: *Bhaava* and *Bhaava-Praabhrut*. *Bhaava-Praabhrut* is the state of the Jiva which is aware of the *Bhaava* and is associated with its use in the present. *No-Aagam* is of five types: *Audayik*, *Upaashaamik*, *Kshaayik*, *Kshaayopaashaamik*, and *Paariinaamik*. *Audayik* is the state of the Jiva which is caused by the *Karma* arising. *Upaashaamik* is the state of the Jiva which is caused by the subsidence of *Karma*. *Kshaayik* is the state of the Jiva which is manifested by the destruction of *Karma*. *Kshaayopaashaamik* is the state of the Jiva which is a part of the Jiva's qualities that remains even when *Karma* is arising. *Paariinaamik* is the state of the Jiva and non-living beings which is different from the above four states. Of all these states, *No-Aagam* is the subject of our discussion here. The state of following this *No-Aagam* is called *Bhaava-Anugam* and it is of two types: *Ogh* and *Aadesh*.

Further, to explain the nature of the *Mithyaadrishti* *Bhaava* in relation to the *Ogh*, the following *Sutra* is stated: "Osheṇ Micchādidi Tti Ko Bhaavo? Odaiyo Bhaavo || 2 ||"

"Which of the five states is the *Mithyaadrishti* *Bhaava* in relation to the *Ogh*? It is the *Audayik* *Bhaava*." || 2 ||

Since the *Bhaava* in the form of *Atattvashrddhaana* arises from the arising of the *Darshanamohaniya* (delusion of perception), it is therefore the *Audayik* *Bhaava*.

"Saasan Sammaa Dihi Tti Ko Bhaavo? Paariinaamiyo Bhaavo || 3 ||"

"What is the *Saasaadan Samyagdristi*? It is the *Paariinaamik* *Bhaava*." || 3 ||

Since the *Saasaadan Samyagdristi* *Bhaava* arises without any dependence on the arising, subsidence, destruction, or subsidence-destruction of the *Darshanamohaniya* *Karma*, it is therefore called the *Paariinaamik* *Bhaava*.

"Sammaa Micchādidi Tti Ko Bhaavo? Khaovsamio Bhaavo || 4 ||"

"What is the *Samyagmithyaadrishti*? It is the *Kshaayopaashaamik* *Bhaava*." || 4 ||

The mixed result of the Jiva in the form of faith and disbelief in the truth is called the *Samyagmithyaadrishti* *Bhaava*. This *Bhaava* is called the *Kshaayopaashaamik* *Bhaava* because it arises from the subsidence-destruction of the *Darshanamohaniya*.

"Asanjad Sammaa Dihi Tti Ko Bhaavo? Uvsamio Va Khaio Va Khaovsamio Va Bhaavo || 5 ||"

"What is the *Asanyatasamyagdristi*? It is the *Upaashaamik* *Bhaava*, the *Kshaayik* *Bhaava*, and the *Kshaayopaashaamik* *Bhaava*." || 5 ||

Page #342:
---------------------------
[1, 7, 11] In the Bhavanugam Gadimangana,
[217] Since the cessation of the arising of all-destroying competitors of the Mithyatva and Samyagmithyatva natures, and the cessation of the arising of the country-destroying competitors of the Samyaktva nature, results in the arising of the Aupashamik Samyaktva, which is the Asanyata Samyagdristi Bhava, therefore it is an Aupashamik Bhava. Since the complete destruction of these natures results in the arising of the Kshayik Samyaktva, which is the Asanyata Samyagdristi Bhava, therefore it is also a Kshayik Bhava. Since the arising, cessation, and cessation in the form of stability of Mithyatva and Samyagmithyatva, and the arising of the country-destroying competitors of the Samyaktva nature, results in the arising of the Vedak Samyaktva, which is the Asanyata Samyagdristi Bhava, therefore it is also a Kshayopaashamik Bhava.
Odaiyaena Bhavena Puno Asanjado || 6 || But the Asanyata of the Asanyata Samyagdristi is due to the Odayik Bhava. || 6 ||
Because this Asanyata Bhava arises from the arising of the Samyama-destroying, Charitra-mohaniya. This Asanyata is also Odayik in the three lower Gunasthanas.
Sanjadasanjad-Pamatta-Appamattasanjada Tti Ko Bhavo? Khaovsamio Bhavo || 7 || What are the Sanjata-Sanjata, Pamatta-Sanjata, and Appamatta-Sanjata Bhavas? They are Kshayopaashamik Bhavas. || 7 ||
Since the Sanjata-Sanjata Bhava arises from the arising, cessation, and cessation in the form of stability of the four Anantanubandhis and the four Apratyakhyana Avaranas, the arising of the four Pratyakhyana Avarana natures, the arising of the country-destroying competitors of the Sanjwalana Chatushk, and the arising of the nine Nokashaya as much as possible, therefore it is a Kshayopaashamik Bhava. Similarly, the Pamatta-Sanjata and Appamatta-Sanjata Bhavas, since they arise from the arising, cessation, and cessation in the form of stability of the twelve Kshayas, including the Anantanubandhis, the arising of the country-destroying competitors of the Sanjwalana Chatushk, and the arising of the nine Nokashaya as much as possible, therefore they are also Kshayopaashamik Bhavas.
Chaduhnhamuvasama Tti Ko Bhavo? Ovasamio Bhavo || 8 || What is the Bhava that is the cessation of the four, including the Apurvakarana? It is an Aupashamik Bhava. || 8 ||
Chaduhnham Khava Sajogikevali Ajogekeli Tti Ko Bhavo? Khaio Bhavo || 9 || What is the Bhava that is the four Kshapaks, Sajogikevali, and Ajogekeli? It is a Kshayik Bhava. || 9 ||
Aadesena Gaiyaanuvaadena Nirayagaiye Neraiyesu Micchaditthi Tti Ko Bhavo? Odaiyo Bhavo || 10 ||
What is the Mithyadristi of the Narakas in the Narakagati, due to the translation of the Gadimangana according to the Aadesha? It is an Odayik Bhava. || 10 ||
Sasanasammaihi Tti Ko Bhavo? Parinaamio Bhavo. || 11 || What is the Sasadan Samyagdristi of the Narakas? It is a Parinaamik Bhava. || 11 ||
Ch. 28

In the **Chakkhandagama**, regarding the **Jiva** (soul):

[1, 7, 12]

What is the **bhaava** (state) of **Samyama-Mithyadrishti** (rightly-wrong view) in **Naraka** (hell)? It is the **Kshayopa-samika** (destructive-subduing) **bhaava**. || 12 ||

What is the **bhaava** of **Asanjat-Sammadrishti** (uncontrolled-right view) in **Naraka**? It is **Upa-samika** (subduing), **Kshayika** (destructive), or **Kshayopa-samika** (destructive-subduing) **bhaava**. || 13 ||

[218]

However, the **Asanjat** (uncontrolled) **bhaava** in **Naraka** is due to the arising of **Samyama-ghataka** (destructive-of-control) **Charitra-mohaniya** (character-delusive), therefore it should be understood as **Audayika** (arising) **bhaava**. || 14 ||

Similarly, in the first **Pruthvi** (earth), **Naraka** beings have the aforementioned four **Gunasthanas** (states of being) related **bhaavas**. || 15 ||

From the second **Pruthvi** to the seventh **Pruthvi**, the **bhaavas** of **Mithyadrishti** (wrong view), **Sasadan-Sammadrishti** (right view with attachment), and **Samyama-Mithyadrishti** (rightly-wrong view) in **Naraka** beings are like a **Oga** (flow). || 16 ||

What is the **bhaava** of **Asanjat-Sammadrishti** (uncontrolled-right view) in the aforementioned **Naraka**? It is **Upa-samika** (subduing) or **Kshayopa-samika** (destructive-subduing) **bhaava**. || 17 ||

Since **Kshayika-Sammadrishti** (destructive-right view) **Jivas** (souls) are not likely to be born in the second and subsequent **Pruthvis**, there is no **Kshayika-Asanjat-Sammadrishti** (destructive-uncontrolled-right view) **bhaava** in the **Naraka** of those **Pruthvis**.

However, the **Asanjat** (uncontrolled) nature of the aforementioned **Naraka** beings with **Asanjat-Sammadrishti** (uncontrolled-right view) is due to **Audayika** (arising) **bhaava**. || 18 ||

In **Tiryag-gati** (animal realm), the **bhaavas** from **Mithyadrishti** (wrong view) to **Sanjat-Asanjat** (controlled-uncontrolled) **Gunasthanas** (states of being) are like a **Oga** (flow) in **Tiryag** (animal), **Panchendriya-Tiryag** (five-sense animal), **Panchendriya-Tiryag-Paryapta** (five-sense animal with sufficient karma), and **Panchendriya-Tiryag-Yoni** (five-sense animal with birth in a particular womb). || 19 ||

Specifically, what is the **bhaava** of **Asanjat-Sammadrishti** (uncontrolled-right view) in **Panchendriya-Tiryag-Yoni** (five-sense animal with birth in a particular womb)?

The special point is that in the five-sense beings, what is the nature of the *asanyata samyagdristi* (uncontrolled right faith)? It is both *aupashamika* (temporary) and *kshayopashamika* (temporary with a tendency to be destroyed). || 20 ||

**[21]**
Odaiyen bhavena puno asanjado || 21 ||

In the human realm, the progression of these emotions from *micchaditti* (false belief) to *ajogikeval* (non-liberated omniscience) is like a stream, encompassing the ordinary human, the accomplished human, and the human women. || 22 ||

The *bhavanavasi* (dwelling in mansions), *vanavantar* (dwelling in forests), and *jyotishka* (luminous) gods and goddesses, as well as the *soudharma* and *ishan* kalpa-dwelling goddesses, all experience a stream of emotions from *micchaditthi* (false belief) to *sasanasamyagdristi* (right faith based on scriptures) and *samyagmicchaditthi* (right faith with false belief). || 24 ||

**[25]**
Asanjad sammaditi tti ko bhavo! Uvasamiyo va khaovsamio va bhavo || 25 ||
What is the nature of the *asanyata samyagdristi* (uncontrolled right faith) of these gods and goddesses? It is both *aupashamika* (temporary) and *kshayopashamika* (temporary with a tendency to be destroyed). || 25 ||

From *Anudisa* to *Sarvarthasiddhi*, the *Asanjat Sammadristi* in the *Vimana-vasi* Devas is *Aupashamik*, *Kshayik*, and *Kshayopa-shamik*. || 28 ||

What is the nature of the *Asanjat Sammadristi* in the *Audarik-misra-kaya-yogi*? It is both *Kshayik* and *Kshayopa-shamik*. || 34 ||
The reason is that the *Kshayik Sammadristi* and the *Vedak Sammadristi* Devas, *Naraki*, and *Manushya* are found to be born in the *Tiryanch* and *Manushya*. Since the *Upasham-sammadristi* beings of the four *Gati* cannot die, the *Upasham Samyaktva* is not found in the *Audarik-misra-kaya-yogi*.

##  Translation:

**222] The Six Realms and the Flow of Beings**

[1, 7, 42] From the stage of *Aṇiyaṭṭi* (non-return) in the *Avagadavedas* to the *Ajogikevali* (liberated without effort), the flow of beings is like a stream. [42]

From the *Apagatavedi* (those who have abandoned the *vedas*) to the *Ajogikevali*, the flow of beings is like a stream, starting from the *Aved* (unrealized) stage of *Anivṛttikaraṇa* (non-return) and progressing through various stages. [42]

In the *Kṣayāṇuvāda* (path of diminishing passions), the flow of beings is like a stream, starting from *Miṭṭhādiṭṭhi* (false belief) in the *Krodhakṣayī* (passionate about anger), *Mānakṣayī* (passionate about pride), *Māyakṣayī* (passionate about deceit), and *Lobhakṣayī* (passionate about greed) and progressing through various stages, culminating in *Suhumasāmpārāyuvāsama* (subtle *saṃpārāya* [state of existence] with *upasāma* [subduing]) and *Suhumasāmpārāyakṣapaka* (subtle *saṃpārāya* with *kṣapaka* [destruction]). [43]

In the *Akṣayī* (passionless) beings, the flow of beings is like a stream, starting from *Upasāntakṣayā* (subdued passions) and progressing through the four stages. [44]

In the *Nāṇāṇuvāda* (path of knowledge), the flow of beings is like a stream, starting from *Miṭṭhādiṭṭhi* (false belief) in the *Madyaṇṇāṇi* (those with limited knowledge), *Sudyaṇṇāṇi* (those with knowledge of scriptures), and *Vibhaṅgaṇāṇi* (those with knowledge of the principles of existence) and progressing to *Sāsaṇasammādiṭṭhi* (right belief based on scriptures). [45]

In the *Ābhiṇibohi* (those with knowledge of the *ābhiniboha* [perception of the past]), *Sud* (those with knowledge of scriptures), and *Odhiṇāṇi* (those with knowledge of the *avadhi* [clairvoyance]), the flow of beings is like a stream, starting from *Asanjadasammādiṭṭhi* (uncontrolled right belief) and progressing through various stages, culminating in *Kṣīṇakṣayavītarāga-chādumattha* (those with subdued passions, free from attachment, and in the state of *chādumattha* [subtle body]). [46]

In the *Maṇaparyavaṇāṇi* (those with knowledge of the mind), the flow of beings is like a stream, starting from *Pamatasanjad* (controlled with negligence) and progressing through various stages, culminating in *Kṣīṇakṣayavītarāga-chādumattha* (those with subdued passions, free from attachment, and in the state of *chādumattha* [subtle body]). [47]

In the *Kevalaṇāṇi* (those with perfect knowledge), the flow of beings is like a stream, starting from *Sajogikevali* (liberated with effort) and progressing to *Ajogikevali* (liberated without effort). [48]

In the *Sanjamāṇuvāda* (path of self-control), the flow of beings is like a stream, starting from *Pamatasanjad* (controlled with negligence) in the *Sanjade* (those with self-control) and progressing through various stages, culminating in *Ajogikevali* (liberated without effort). [49]

In the *Sāmayika* (those who practice *sāmayika* [voluntary fasting]) and *Chēdovastthāvaṇasuddhisanjade* (those who practice *chēdovastthāvaṇasuddhi* [purification through self-control]), the flow of beings is like a stream, starting from *Pamatasanjad* (controlled with negligence) and progressing through various stages, culminating in *Aṇiyaṭṭi* (non-return).

## Chapter 124: The State of the Soul in the Six Realms

[1, 7, 61] From Mithyadrishti (false belief) in the Sukkaleshya (white-bodied) to Sayogikevali (perfect knowledge with attachment), the progression of these states is like the flow of a river. [61]

From Mithyadrishti (false belief) in the Bhavyasiddhi (potential for liberation) to Ajoygikevali (perfect knowledge without attachment), the progression of these states is like the flow of a river. [62]

What is meant by Abhavyasiddhi (non-potential for liberation)? It is a Pariṇāmik (resultant) state. [63]

From Asanjad Sammadrishti (uncontrolled right belief) in the Sammadrishti (right belief) to Ajoygikevali (perfect knowledge without attachment), the progression of these states is like the flow of a river. [64]

What is meant by Asanjad Sammadrishti (uncontrolled right belief) in the Kshayik Sammadrishti (right belief with potential for destruction)? It is a Kshayik (perishable) state. [65]

The Sammatva (right belief) of these beings is Kshayik (perishable). [66]

The Asanjad (uncontrolled) nature of the Kshayik Sammadrishti (right belief with potential for destruction) is due to the Audayik (arising) state. [67]

What is meant by Sanjad (controlled), Asanjad (uncontrolled), Prammat (careless), Aprammat (careful) Sanjad (controlled)? It is a Kshayopaśamik (perishable and pacified) state. [68]

This is because even though the four Gunasthana (stages of spiritual progress) beings have the Audayik (arising) state of the Charitramohaniya (hindering conduct) karma, they still experience the Sanjad (controlled), Asanjad (uncontrolled), Prammat (careless), and Aprammat (careful) Sanjad (controlled) states, which are part of their Charitra (conduct).

The Sammatva (right belief) of these beings is Kshayik (perishable). [69]

What is meant by Chaduṇhamuvasama (fourfold pacification)? It is a Ovasamik (pacified) state. [70]

[226] In the six-fold division of the world, the state of the living being is:

[1, 7, 82]  The state of the living being with *upasama* right faith, *asanyata* right faith, *asanyata* nature, and *audhayika* nature is [81]  What is the nature of *sanjada*, *asanjada*, *prammatta*, and *apprammatta* *sanjada*? It is *kshayomshamaka* nature. [82]
*Upasama* right faith, *sanjata*, *asanjata*, *prammatta* *sanjata*, and *aprammatta* *sanjata* - what is this nature? It is *kshayomshamaka* nature. [82]
*Upasamiya* *sammatta*. [83]  This is the *upashamika* right faith of the living beings. [83]
*Chaduṇhamuvasama* - what is this nature? It is *upashamika* nature. [84]
*Apuurvakarana* and the other four *gunasthanas* - what is the *upashamika* nature of *upasama* right faith in these? It is *upashamika* nature. [84]
*Uvasamiya* *sammatta*. [85]  This is the *upashamika* right faith of the living beings. [85]
*Sasanasammadiṭṭhi* is like an *ogha*. [86]
*Sasadan* right faith is a *parinamik* nature like an *ogha*. [86]
*Sammāmichchādīṭṭhi* is like an *ogha*. [87]
*Samyagmithyadristi* is a *kshayomshamaka* nature like an *ogha*. [87]
*Michchādīṭṭhi* is like an *ogha*. [88]
*Mithyadristi* is an *audhayika* nature like an *ogha*. [88]
*Sanīyāṇuvādeṇa saṇṇīsu michchādīṭṭippahuḍi jāv khīṇakasaaya-vīdarāga-chadu-matthā ti oghaṃ*. [89]
_According to the *sanjñī* path, the nature of the *sanjñīs* from *mithyadristi* to *kṣīṇakṣaya-vītarāga-chhadmastha* is like an *ogha*. [89]
*Asanṇi* - what is this nature? It is *audhayika* nature. [90]
*Asanjnī* - what is this nature? It is *audhayika* nature. [90]
The reason for this is that it (non-consciousness) arises from the rise of the *noindriyavaranas*, which are the destroyers of all *spardhas*.
*Āhārāṇuvādeṇa āhāresu michchādīhippahuḍi jāv sajogikevali tti oghaṃ*. [91]
According to the *ahāra* path, the nature of the *ahāras* from *mithyadristi* to *sayogikevali* is like an *ogha*. [91]

[1, 8, 1] The description of the stream of *appapāhugaṇu* is in two ways: by the stream and by the instruction. [1]
The *alpabahutva* (litt. "little-muchness") is of four types, according to name, establishment, substance, and state. Of these, the word "alpabahutva" is *nāmalpabahutva* (name-little-muchness). That which is established by the relation of "this is much" and "this is little" is *sthāpanāalpabahutva* (establishment-little-muchness).
*Dravyāalpabahutva* (substance-little-muchness) is of two types, according to whether it is *āgama* (acquired) or *noāgama* (not acquired). The *āgamadravyāalpabahutva* is that which is known by the *prābhṛta* (knowledge of the past) but is not used in the present. *Noāgamadravyāalpabahutva* is of three types, according to whether it is *jñāyakaśarīra* (knowing body), *bhāvi* (future), or *tadvyatirikta* (other than that). The *bhāvi noāgamadravyāalpabahutva* is that which will be known by the *prābhṛta* in the future. The *tadvyatirikta noāgamadravyāalpabahutva* is of three types, according to whether it is *sacitta* (with consciousness), *acitta* (without consciousness), or *miśra* (mixed). The *sacitta tadvyatirikta noāgamadravyāalpabahutva* is that which is related to the substance of the living being. The *acitta tadvyatirikta noāgamadravyāalpabahutva* is that which is related to the substance of other than the living being. The *miśra tadvyatirikta noāgamadravyāalpabahutva* is that which is related to both.
*Bhāvāalpabahutva* (state-little-muchness) is of two types, according to whether it is *āgama* or *noāgama*. The *āgamabhāvāalpabahutva* is that which is known by the *prābhṛta* and is also used in the present. The *noāgamabhāvāalpabahutva* is that which is related to knowledge, perception, *anubhāga* (part), and *yoga* (spiritual practice). Of these types of *alpabahutva*, the *sacitta noāgamadravyāalpabahutva* is the most important here.

In the **Chakkhandaga** (Six-Part) **Gama** (Scripture), the number of **Jivas** (Souls) entering the **Uvasama** (State of Tranquility) is equal to the number entering the **Aaddha** (Half) **Uvasama** (State of Tranquility). || 2 ||

The number of **Jivas** entering the three **Gunasthanas** (States of Being) of **Apuurvakarana** (Initial Action), **Upashamaka** (Tranquilizer), and **Aadi** (First) is equal to each other, but less than the number entering all other **Gunasthanas**. || 2 ||

**[228]**

The reason for this is that in these **Gunasthanas**, starting from the **Aadi** (First), a maximum of 44 **Jivas** enter.

The number of **Jivas** in the **Uvasantaka** (Tranquilizer) **Kshaya** (State of Diminishing Karma), **Veedraga** (Free from Passion), and **Chhadumatta** (Covered) **Gunasthanas** is the same as mentioned before. || 3 ||

Since the number of **Jivas** in the **Uvasantaka** **Kshaya** **Gunasthanas** is the same as the **Apuurvakarana** **Upashamaka** (Tranquilizer) and others, they could have been included in the previous **Sutra** (Aphorism). However, the purpose of this separate **Sutra** is to show the difference between them and the three **Upashamaka** (Tranquilizer) **Gunasthanas** of **Apuurvakarana** (Initial Action) and others.

**[1, 8, 2]**

The number of **Jivas** in the **Kshapaka** (Destroyer) **Gunasthanas** is multiplied by the number of **Jivas** in the **Uvasantaka** **Kshaya** (State of Diminishing Karma), **Veedraga** (Free from Passion), and **Chhadumatta** (Covered) **Gunasthanas**. || 4 ||

The reason for this is that the number of **Jivas** entering the **Kshapaka** (Destroyer) **Gunasthanas** is twice (a maximum of 108) the number entering the **Upashamaka** (Tranquilizer) **Gunasthanas** mentioned before. Similarly, the number of **Jivas** entering the **Sanchaya** (Accumulation) **Gunasthanas** is also twice (598) the number entering the **Upashamaka** (Tranquilizer) **Gunasthanas** (299).

The number of **Jivas** in the **Kheena** (Diminished) **Kshaya** (State of Diminishing Karma), **Veedraga** (Free from Passion), and **Chhadumatta** (Covered) **Gunasthanas** is the same as mentioned before. || 5 ||

The reason for this separate **Sutra** should be understood as the same as before.

The number of **Jivas** entering the **Sayogika** (With Attachment) **Kevali** (Omniscient) and **Aayogika** (Without Attachment) **Kevali** (Omniscient) **Gunasthanas** is equal to each other and the same as mentioned before. || 6 ||

The meaning is that the number of **Jivas** entering these **Gunasthanas** is a maximum of 108, and the number entering the **Sanchaya** (Accumulation) **Gunasthanas** is a maximum of 598.

The number of **Jivas** entering the **Sayogika** (With Attachment) **Kevali** (Omniscient) **Gunasthanas** is multiplied by the number of **Jivas** entering the **Kala** (Time) **Gunasthanas**. || 7 ||

The number of **Jivas** entering the **Akshapaka** (Non-Destroyer) and **Anupashamaka** (Non-Tranquilizer) **Gunasthanas** is multiplied by the number of **Jivas** entering the **Aparamatta** (Non-Negligent) **Sanjata** (Controlled) **Gunasthanas** and the **Jivas** entering the **Sayogika** (With Attachment) **Kevali** (Omniscient) **Gunasthanas**. || 8 ||

The *Veda Sammadithi* (knowing right faith) are *Asankhejjaguna* (innumerably multiplied) by the *Khaiya Sammadithi* (destructive right faith) in the *Asanjada Sammadithi* (unrestrained right faith) state. || 17 ||

23.] In the six-fold world, the number of living beings is:
[1, 8, 22]  The number of Kshayika Samyagdrishtis is multiplied by the number of  Samyagdrishtis in the  Pramatta-Samyata and  A-Pramatta-Samyata Gunasthanas. [22]
The number of Vedaka Samyagdrishtis is multiplied by the number of Kshayika Samyagdrishtis in the Pramatta-Samyata and A-Pramatta-Samyata Gunasthanas. [23]
Thus, in the three Upa-shamaka Gunasthanas, there is a difference in the number of Samyagdrishtis. It should be understood that there is no possibility of Kshayika-Upa-shamaka Samyagdrishtis. [24]
In all the three Gunasthanas, the number of Upa-shamaka Jivas is the least. [25]
The number of Kshapaka Jivas in the three Gunasthanas is multiplied by the number of Upa-shamaka Jivas in the three Gunasthanas. [26]
According to the order, the number of Sasadan Samyagdrishtis is the least in the Narakas in the Naraka-Gati, as per the translation of the Gati-Margana. [27]
The number of Samyag-Mithyadrishtis is multiplied by the number of Sasadan Samyagdrishtis. [28]
The number of Asanjat Samyagdrishtis is multiplied by the number of Samyag-Mithyadrishtis. [29]
The number of Mithyadrishtis is multiplied by the number of Asanjat Samyagdrishtis. [30]
In the Asanjat Samyagdrishti Gunasthanas, the number of Upa-shamaka Samyagdrishtis is the least. [31]
The number of Kshayika Samyagdrishtis is multiplied by the number of Upa-shamaka Samyagdrishtis in the Asanjat Samyagdrishti Gunasthanas. [32]
The number of Vedaka Samyagdrishtis is multiplied by the number of Kshayika Samyagdrishtis. [33]
Thus, in the first Prithvi, the number of Narakas is also to be understood. [34]

9. **Jiva-dvaan - Chuliyaa-e Padhma Chuliyaa**

The question arises: How many and what types of karmas does a jiva with mithyatva-drishti bind, and by what duration of karmas does it attain samyaktva or not attain samyaktva? How much time does it take to perform mithyatva karma, and in what areas and at whose feet does the destruction of darshan-mohaniya karma occur for a jiva who has destroyed all its charitra, and for a jiva who has attained complete charitra? || 1 ||

The detailed explanation of the difficult (duraravobodh) aspects of the above-mentioned anuyog-dwaras is called Chulika. This Chulika related to jiva-sthana is of nine types. It is as follows:

The phrase "How many types of karmas does it bind" in the sutra indicates the first two Chulikaas, namely, Prakriti-samutkirtan and Sthana-samutkirtan. The phrase "What types of karmas does it bind" further indicates the third, fourth, and fifth Chulikaas, namely, Prathama Dandaka, Dvitiya Dandaka, and Tritiya Dandaka. Further, the phrase "By what duration of karmas does it attain samyaktva and by what duration of karmas does it not attain samyaktva" in the same sutra indicates the sixth Chulika, Utkrishta-sthiti, and the seventh Chulika, Jaghanya-sthiti. Subsequently, the phrase "In what areas and at whose feet" in the sutra indicates the eighth Chulika, Samyaktva-utpatti. The last phrase "Charitam va sampurnna padivajjantas" in the original sutra, with the inclusion of the word "va", indicates the ninth and final Chulika, Gati-agati. The detailed explanation of all these will be given in their respective places.

The phrase "How many and what types of karmas does it bind" is a part of the previous sutra, and its explanation is given here. || 2 ||

Chhakkanḍāgame Jīvaṭṭhāṇam
[1, 9-1, 3
Idāṇiṁ Pagadisamukittanaṁ Kassāmo ||3|| Now we will describe the nature of the elements. ||3||
The description of the elements is called the element description. It is said that the element description means the description of the nature of the elements. That element description is of two types, the original element description and the subsequent element description. From the perspective of the dravyaarthicnaya, the element that encompasses all the differences within itself is called the original element. From the perspective of the paryayaarthicnaya, the element that is separate and distinct is called the subsequent element. Of these, here first the form of the original elements that encompass all the subsequent elements is described.
Tam Jahā ||4|| Ṇāṇāvarṇīyaṁ ||5|| That element description is as follows. ||4|| The knowledge-obscuring karma is. ||5||
Knowledge, understanding, comprehension, and perception are all synonymous terms. The karma that obscures this knowledge is called the knowledge-obscuring karma. By saying "knowledge-obscuring," it should be understood that it can obscure the knowledge that is the characteristic of the jiva, but it can never destroy it. The reason is that if the complete destruction of knowledge and perception is assumed, then the destruction of the jiva would also be inevitable, because the object without its characteristic cannot be found. But this is not possible. In reality, the smallest part of the infinite part of the letter is constantly manifested - it is never obscured. The karma that obscures this knowledge quality is the knowledge-obscuring karma, which is material and flows continuously from beginning to end.
Daśaṇāvarṇīyaṁ ||6|| The perception-obscuring karma is. ||6||
The use of the self as the object is called perception. Where knowledge is the object of external meanings, there perception is the object of the internal, this is the difference between the two. Like knowledge, this perception quality is never completely destroyed, because otherwise, the destruction of the jiva itself would be unavoidable. The karma that obscures this type of perception quality is the perception-obscuring karma. The meaning is that the material aggregate that is transformed into karma by means of falsehood, non-restraint, passions, and yoga, and which, by being connected with the jiva, obscures the perception quality, should be understood as the perception-obscuring karma.
Vedaniyaṁ ||7|| The karmic experience is. ||7||

[261
Vedaniya karma is that which is experienced, i.e., felt. 'Vedyaate iti Vedaniyaam' - that which is experienced is Vedaniya. Although this etymological explanation applies to all karmas, here, due to convention, the term 'Vedaniya' should be understood as referring to the specific karma of Poudgalika. Alternatively, according to the etymology 'Vedayati iti Vedaniyaam', the Poudgalaskandha which, due to Mithyatva etc., becomes associated with the Jīva and causes it to experience pleasure and pain, is called Vedaniya.

Mohaṇīya karma is || 8 ||
'Mohayati iti Mohaṇīyaṃ' - that which deludes the Jīva is called 'Mohaṇīya'. Similar to the term 'Vedaniya', the term 'Mohaṇīya' should also be understood as a specific karma. Therefore, although Dhatura, alcohol, and women etc. also delude the Jīva, they are not considered Mohaṇīya.

'Eti Bhavadhāraṇam Prati iti Āyuḥ' - that which goes towards Bhavadhāraṇam is Āyu karma. The meaning is that the Poudgalaskandha which, due to Mithyatva etc., becomes associated with the Jīva and has the power to cause it to be born in Naraka etc., is called Āyu karma.
Nāmaṃ || 10 ||
Nāma karma is || 10 ||
That which creates various forms is called Nāma karma. The meaning is that the Poudgalaskandha which becomes associated with the Jīva and performs the functions of creating the body and its structure, cohesion, color, and smell etc., is called Nāma karma.
Godam || 11 ||
Gotra karma is || 11 ||
'Gamayati Ucca-Nīca Kulaṃ iti Gotram' - that which causes birth in high and low families is called Gotra karma. The meaning is that the Poudgalaskandha which, due to Mithyatva etc., becomes associated with the Jīva and causes it to be born in high and low families,

Thus, after indicating the eight fundamental principles, their further subdivisions are now indicated.

Abhimukha and regular meaning understanding is called Abhinibodha. Here, Abhimukha means gross, present and unobstructed meanings. In the Chakshu Indriya, Rūpa, in the Śrotra Indriya, Śabda, in the Ghṛāṇa Indriya, Gandha, in the Rasana Indriya, Rasa, in the Sparśana Indriya, Sparśa and in the No Indriya (Mind), Dṛṣṭa, Śruta and Anubhūta objects are regular. The understanding of such Abhimukha and regular objects is called Abhinibodha. This Abhinibodha is taken here in the form of Ābhinibodhika. That Ābhinibodhika Jñāna is of four types, due to Avagraha, Īhā, Avāya and Dhāraṇā. After the connection of Viṣaya (external object) and Viṣayī (Indriyas), the first understanding is called Avagraha. It is of two types - Artha Avagraha and Vyañjanā Avagraha. Among these, the one which understands the unacquired meaning is called Artha Avagraha and the one which understands the acquired meaning is called Vyañjanā Avagraha. In these, the understanding of the unacquired meaning is through the Chakshu Indriya and the understanding of the acquired meaning is through the Sparśana, etc., Indriyas. The special knowledge in the form of Ākāṅkṣā, which arises regarding the object understood through Avagraha, is called Īhā. For example, 'This should be a Bhavyā' - this type of knowledge. The certain knowledge which removes doubt regarding the object understood through Īhā is called Avāya. For example, 'This is indeed a Bhavyā'. This type of knowledge. The knowledge due to which a Samskāra, which is the cause of non-forgetting, arises in the Jīva even after a long time, is called Dhāraṇā. These four types of knowledge are Bahu, Bahuvidha, Kṣipra, Aniḥsṛta, Anukta, Dhruva and their opposites, Eka, Ekavidha, Akṣipra, Niḥsṛta,

[264] .. In the six realms, the abode of the living beings
[1, 9-1, 16] There are nine types of Darshanavaraniya Karma. || 15 ||
Nidaanidda, Payalapayala, Theenagiddhi, Nidaa, Payala, Chakkhudansgaavaraneya, Achakkhudansanavaraneya, Ohi-dasanavaraneya, and Kevaldasanavaraneya. || 16 ||
Nidaanidda, Prachala Prachala, Tyaanagridhi, Nidaa and Prachala; as well as Chakkhudarshanavaraneya, Achakkhudarshanavaraneya, Avhidarshanavaraneya and Kevaldarshanavaraneya, these are the nine types of Darshanavaraniya Karma. || 16 ||
Due to the intense arising of the Nidaanidda nature, the living being sleeps deeply, whether it is on a rough surface, on a tree, or anywhere else, with or without snoring. Due to the intense arising of the Prachala Prachala nature, the being sleeps deeply even while sitting or standing. In that state, saliva drips from its mouth and the body trembles. Due to the intense arising of the Tyaanagridhi nature, even when lifted, the being falls back to sleep, and even while sleeping, it performs actions, mumbles and grinds its teeth. Due to the intense arising of the Nidaa nature, the being sleeps for a short time, wakes up quickly when lifted, and becomes aware even with a faint sound. Due to the intense arising of the Prachala nature, the eyes become heavy like they are filled with sand, the head feels heavy like it is carrying a heavy load, the eyes open and close repeatedly, it falls asleep while walking but manages to catch itself, trembles slightly, and sleeps cautiously. These five natures, because they destroy the consciousness of the living being and obstruct its Darshan guna, are therefore included under Darshanavaraniya.
The self-awareness associated with the effort to generate knowledge is called Darshan. The meaning is that the use that the soul makes of the object is called Darshan. When self-awareness is associated with the effort to generate knowledge related to the eye sense, the reason for the possibility of 'I am able to see forms' is called Chakkhudarshan. The Karma that covers this Chakkhudarshan is called Chakkhudarshanavaraneya Karma. The Darshan of the remaining four senses and the mind, other than the eye sense, is called Achakkhudarshan. The Karma that covers this Achakkhudarshan is called Achakkhudarshanavaraneya Karma. The Darshan of Avadhi is called Avhidarshan. The Karma that covers this Avhidarshan is called Avhidarshanavaraneya Karma. The Darshan that is free from opposition is called Kevaldarshan. The Karma that covers this Kevaldarshan is called Kevaldarshanavaraneya Karma.

There are twenty-eight categories of mohaniya karma. [19]

Mohaniya karma is of two types: **darshanamohaniya** and **charitramohaniya**. [20]

Darshanamohaniya karma is one type in terms of bondage, but it has three types of **sattva**: **samyaktva**, **mithyatva**, and **samyagmithyatva**. [21]

**Darshan** is the interest or faith in the **apt**, **agama**, and **padartha**. Darshanamohaniya karma is that which obscures or distorts this darshan. The arising of this karma leads to the development of **apt**-like understanding in the **anapt**, **agama**-like understanding in the **anagama**, and **padartha**-like understanding in the **apadartha**. It also leads to instability in faith in the **apt**, **agama**, and **padartha**, and to faith in both **apt** and **anapt**, **agama** and **anagama**, and **padartha** and **apadartha**.

Darshanamohaniya karma is one type in terms of bondage because the **pudgala skandha** that arises due to **mithyatva** and other causes of bondage is of one nature. However, it is of three types in terms of **sattva** because just as the **kod**, **tandul**, and **artha tandul** are three parts of the **kod** that is ground by a millstone, similarly, the **darshanamohaniya** that is ground by the **apuurvakarana** and other **parinama** is divided into three parts. The **sattva** that leads to weakening of faith in the **apt**, **agama**, and **padartha** is called **samyaktva**. The **sattva** that leads to disbelief in the **apt**, **agama**, and **padartha** is called **mithyatva**. The **sattva** that leads to faith in both the **apt**, **agama**, and **padartha** and their opposites, **kudeva**, **kushastra**, and **kutattva**, is called **samyagmithyatva**.

Charitramohaniya karma is of two types: **kashayavedaniya** and **nokashayavedaniya**. [22]

**Charitra** is the cessation of **papakriya**. **Papakriya** refers to the actions of the **ghatika**. Therefore, **charitra** should be understood as the absence of their actions, which are characterized by **mithyatva**, **aviraati**, etc.

**Six-Part Doctrine (Shadkhandagama) on the Nature of the Soul (Jiva)**

**[1.9-1.23]**

The **Charitramohaniya** (that which obscures the conduct) karma is of two types: **Kasaya-Vedaniya** (that which is experienced through passions) and **No-Kasaya-Vedaniya** (that which is not experienced through passions).

The **Kasaya-Vedaniya** karma is of sixteen types:

* **Ananta-Anubandhi** (infinitely binding) **Krodha** (anger), **Mana** (pride), **Maya** (deceit), **Lobha** (greed)
* **A-Pratyakhyana-Avaraniya** (that which prevents the rejection of) **Krodha**, **Mana**, **Maya**, **Lobha**
* **Pratyakhyana-Avaraniya** (that which covers the rejection of) **Krodha**, **Mana**, **Maya**, **Lobha**
* **Krodha-Sanjalan** (agitation of anger), **Mana-Sanjalan** (agitation of pride), **Maya-Sanjalan** (agitation of deceit), **Lobha-Sanjalan** (agitation of greed)

The **Kasayas** (passions) are the four roots of karma that cultivate the field of karma, producing the fruits of suffering. They are: **Krodha**, **Mana**, **Maya**, and **Lobha**.

* **Krodha** (anger), **Rosh** (wrath), and **Sanrambh** (impatience) are synonyms.
* **Mana** (pride) and **Garv** (arrogance) are synonyms.
* **Maya** (deceit), **Nikriti** (deception), **Vachana** (fraud), and **Kutila** (cunning) are synonyms.
* **Lobha** (greed) and **Grdhi** (avarice) are synonyms.

The **Ananta-Anubandhi** **Krodha**, **Mana**, **Maya**, and **Lobha** are those whose nature is to keep the cycle of births and deaths going. They are the passions that bind the soul to the endless cycle of transmigration.

The **A-Pratyakhyana-Avaraniya** **Krodha**, **Mana**, **Maya**, and **Lobha** are those that hinder the rejection of the passions, preventing the soul from achieving **Desha-Samyama** (control over the senses).

The **Pratyakhyana-Avaraniya** **Krodha**, **Mana**, **Maya**, and **Lobha** are those that cover the rejection of the passions, preventing the soul from achieving **Samyama** (self-control) and **Mahavrata** (great vows).

The **Sanjalan** **Krodha**, **Mana**, **Maya**, and **Lobha** are those that, even though they arise with the conduct, do not hinder it. They are the passions that are in harmony with the conduct, but still prevent the soul from achieving **Charitra** (good conduct).

The **Sanjalan** passions are considered to be **Charitra-Avarana** (obstructions to good conduct) because they create impurities in the **Samyama** (self-control) and hinder the development of **Charitra**.

**[1.24]**

The **No-Kasaya-Vedaniya** karma is of nine types:

* **Itthi-Ved** (female karma), **Purusha-Ved** (male karma), **Napunsaka-Ved** (neuter karma)
* **Hasaradi** (karma of stealing), **Ara-di** (karma of violence), **Soga** (karma of sorrow), **Bhaya** (karma of fear), **Dughancha** (karma of doubt)

1, 9-1, 28].  The five minor karmas are: laughter, attraction, aversion, sorrow, fear, and disgust. || 24 ||
The word 'no' in 'nokṣāya' should be understood as a negation of one part. The meaning is that 'nokṣāya' refers to minor karmas. Since their state and divisions are inferior to those of the major karmas, they are considered minor karmas.
The karma-skandhas whose arising causes the desire for a male body are called 'strīveda'. The karma-skandhas whose arising causes the desire for a female body are called 'puruṣaved'. The karma-skandhas whose arising causes the desire for both male and female bodies, like the fire that burns bricks indiscriminately, are called 'napumsakaved'. The karma-skandhas whose arising causes the laughter of the jīva due to attachment are called 'hāsyanokṣāya'. The karma-skandhas whose arising causes the jīva to experience attachment to substances, places, time, and emotions are called 'ratinokṣāya'. The karma-skandhas whose arising causes the jīva to experience aversion to substances, places, time, and emotions are called 'aratinokṣāya'.

There are four types of āyu karma. || 25 || They are: hellish āyu, animal āyu, human āyu, and divine āyu. || 26 ||
The karma-skandhas whose arising causes the jīva with an upward-going nature to reside in hell are called 'nārkaāyu'. The karma-skandhas whose arising causes the jīva to reside in the animal realm are called 'tiryagāyu'. Similarly, one should understand the nature of 'manuşyāyu' and 'devāyu'.
There are forty-two types of name karma. || 27 ||
They are: name, lineage, body, body-binding, body-aggregation, body-destruction, body-limbs, body-composition, color, smell, taste, touch, size, heaviness, lightness, obstruction, passage, exhalation, inhalation, illumination, flying, standing, sitting, lying, subtle, fine, coarse, and edible.

[1, 9-1, 41]

The **Anupurvi Karma** is of four types: **Naraka-Gati-Prayogya-Anupurvi Karma**, **Tiryag-Gati-Prayogya-Anupurvi Karma**, **Manushya-Gati-Prayogya-Anupurvi Karma**, and **Deva-Gati-Prayogya-Anupurvi Karma**.

The **Naraka-Gati-Prayogya-Anupurvi Karma** is the karma that, upon its fruition, causes a living being to be born in hell and have a body suitable for hell. Similarly, the other three types of **Anupurvi Karma** should be understood.

**Aguru-Alagha Karma**, **Upghata Karma**, **Paraghata Karma**, **Uchchvas Karma**, **Atap Karma**, and **Udyot Karma**.

The statement "There are forty-two **Pinda-Prakriti** (types of karma)" is a statement of importance. These **Prakriti** are not **Pinda-Prakriti**, and they are mentioned here to clarify this point.

**Vihayoga-Gati Karma** is of two types: **Prashasta-Vihayoga-Gati Karma** and **Aprashasta-Vihayoga-Gati Karma**.

**Prashasta-Vihayoga-Gati Karma** is the karma that, upon its fruition, causes a living being to have a noble gait, like that of a lion, elephant, or bull. **Aprashasta-Vihayoga-Gati Karma** is the karma that, upon its fruition, causes a living being to have an ignoble gait, like that of a donkey, camel, or jackal.

**Tras Karma**, **Sthavar Karma**, **Badar Karma**, **Sukshma Karma**, and **Paryapta Karma**, and so on, up to **Nirmiti-Tirthankara Karma**.

## Jiva-sthāna - Explanation of the Chūlikā

[275
There are two types of **Gotr Karma**: **Uchchagotr** and **Nicchagotr**. || 45 ||
[1, 9-2, 2]
**Uchchagotr Karma** is the karma that leads to a noble **Gotr** for the Jiva, while **Nicchagotr Karma** leads to a **Gotr** that is condemned by the world.

There are five types of **Antarāy Karma**: **Dānantarāy**, **Lābhantarāy**, **Bhogantarāy**, **Paribhogantarāy**, and **Vīryantarāy**. || 46 ||
**Dānantarāy Karma** is the karma that creates obstacles for the Jiva while giving **Dāna**. **Lābhantarāy Karma** creates obstacles in gaining **Lābha**. **Bhogantarāy Karma** creates obstacles in enjoying **Bhoga**. **Paribhogantarāy Karma** creates obstacles in enjoying **Paribhoga**. **Bhoga** refers to something enjoyed once, like **Tambūl** and food and drink. **Paribhoga** refers to something enjoyed repeatedly, like women, clothes, and ornaments. **Vīryantarāy Karma** creates obstacles in **Vīrya**.

|| The first **Chūlikā** named **Prakṛtisamutkīrtana** ends here. || 1 ||

## 2. Vidyā Chūlikā

Now we will explain the **Sthāna-samutkīrtana**. || 1 ||
**Sthāna** refers to the specific number or state in which the **Prakṛtis** reside. **Samutkīrtana**, **Varṇana**, and **Prarūpaṇā** are synonymous terms. The explanation of the said **Sthāna** is called **Sthāna-samutkīrtana**. The meaning is that the **Prakṛtis** mentioned in the first **Chūlikā** named **Prakṛtisamutkīrtana** are only mentioned, but their **Bandha** is not explained. Whether they are bound together or sequentially is explained in this second **Chūlikā** named **Sthāna-samutkīrtana**.

This **Sthāna-samutkīrtana** is as follows. || 2 ||

---------------------------
[276] In the **Chakkhandagama**, the **Jiva**'s **Tthana** (abode)

[1,9-2,3] Now, to describe the nature and number of these **Tthana**s, the **Uttara Sutra** says:

That **Prakriti Tthana** is of the **Mithyadristi**, **Sasadan Samyagdristi**, **Samyag Mithyadristi**, **Asanjat Samyagdristi**, **Sanjat Asanjat**, or **Sanjat** [3].

That **Tthana**, i.e., **Prakriti Tthana**, is of the **Mithyadristi**, or **Sasadan Samyagdristi**, or **Samyag Mithyadristi**, or **Asanjat Samyagdristi**, or **Sanjat Asanjat**, or **Sanjat**, because there are no other **Bandhakas** (binders) except these. Here, the word **Sanjat** should be understood to include all eight **Sanjat Gunasthanas** from **Pramattasanjat** to **Sayogika Kevali**, because there is no difference in their **Sanjat** nature. The **Ayogika Kevali Gunasthan** is not included here, because **Bandha** is not possible there.

The **Jnana Avaraniya Karma** has five **Payadis** (natures): **Abhinibodhika Jnana Avaraniya**, **Shruta Jnana Avaraniya**, **Avadhi Jnana Avaraniya**, **Manahparyaya Jnana Avaraniya**, and **Kevala Jnana Avaraniya** [4].

These five **Payadis** are bound in the **Jiva** in a single state [5].

The **Jiva** who binds these five **Payadis** has a single **Tthana**, i.e., **Avasthana**, denoted by the number 'five'. This means that the binding of these five **Payadis** occurs simultaneously due to a specific **Parinam** (transformation).

That **Bandha Tthana** is of the **Mithyadristi**, **Sasadan Samyagdristi**, **Samyag Mithyadristi**, **Asanjat Samyagdristi**, **Sanjat Asanjat**, or **Sanjat** [6].

Here, the word '**Sanjat**' should be understood to include only **Sanjat** **Jivas** up to **Sukshma Samparayika Sanjat**, because **Jivas** above this level do not bind that **Jnana Avaraniya Karma**.

The **Darshan Avaraniya Karma** has three **Bandha Tthana**s: **Navanham** (nine **Prakriti**s), **Chhandam** (six **Prakriti**s), and **Chaundam** (four **Prakriti**s) [7].

Page #402:
---------------------------
[1.9-2.13]  The location of the *jiva*’s *sthāna* (location) is explained in detail by nine *sūtras* (aphorisms).
[277] Now, the explanation of this is given by nine *sūtras*.
There are nine *sthānas* (locations) – *nidrānidrā*, *prayalāprayalā*, *sthānagriddhi*, *nidrā*, *prayalā*, *chakshudarśanāvaraṇīya*, *achakshudarśanāvaraṇīya*, *avhidarśanāvaraṇīya*, and *kevaladarśanāvaraṇīya*.  This is the first *bandhasthāna* (bond-location). || 8 ||
In the *darśanāvaraṇīya karma* (karma that obscures vision), the three *bandhasthānas* are *nidrānidrā*, *prayalāprayalā*, and *sthānagriddhi*.  Excluding these three, the remaining six are *nidrā*, *prayalā*, *chakshudarśanāvaraṇīya*, *achakshudarśanāvaraṇīya*, *avhidarśanāvaraṇīya*, and *kevaladarśanāvaraṇīya*.  This is the second *bandhasthāna*. || 11 ||
The *jiva* who binds these six *prakr̥tis* (substances) is in one state of being. || 12 ||
The owner of this second *bandhasthāna* of six *prakr̥tis* is either *samyagmithyādṛṣṭi* (one who has both right and wrong views), *asanyatasamyagdṛṣṭi* (one who has right views but is not restrained), *sanyatāsanyata* (one who is both restrained and unrestrained), or *sanyata* (one who is restrained). || 13 ||
Here, in the *sūtra*, the word “*sanyata*” should be understood to include all those who are restrained in the first part of the seven parts of *apūrvakaraṇa* (karma that creates new karma).

Page #403:
---------------------------
[278] In the six-fold division of the soul's abode,
[1, 9-2, 14] There are four types of karma: *Chakshudarshanavaranīya*, *Achakshudarshanavaranīya*, *Avhidarshanavaranīya*, and *Kevaldarshanavaranīya*. These four types of karma constitute the third bondage-place. [14]
Excluding *Nidrā* (sleep) and *Prachalā* (restlessness) from the second bondage-place, these four types of karma constitute the third bondage-place. [14]
The soul bound by these four types of karma has only one state. [15]
Since the word *prākṛta* (nature) is used in the sixth and seventh cases, it could also mean that the soul bound by these seven types of karma has only one state.
This third bondage-place is of the *Sanjata* (restrained). [16]
This is because the bondage of these four types of karma is found from the second part of the seven parts of *Apūrva* (unseen) karma up to the *Sūkṣma Sāmprāyika Śuddha Sanjata* (subtle, universal, pure, restrained).
There are two types of *Vedaniya* (karmic) karma: *Sāta Vedaniya* (pleasant karmic experience) and *Asāta Vedaniya* (unpleasant karmic experience). [17]
The soul bound by these two types of karma has only one state. [18]
Since *Sāta Vedaniya* and *Asāta Vedaniya* are mutually exclusive, they cannot be bound together. They are bound due to purity and defilement respectively. Therefore, although they cannot have the same place, the one place mentioned here refers to their being in one number. This is the meaning that should be understood.
This bondage-place of *Vedaniya* karma is of the *Mithyādr̥ṣṭi* (false faith), *Sāsādanasamyaṅdr̥ṣṭi* (right faith with wrong conduct), *Samyaṅmithyādr̥ṣṭi* (wrong faith with right conduct), *Asanjatasamyaṅdr̥ṣṭi* (right faith with unrestrained conduct), *Sanjatāsanjata* (restrained and unrestrained), and *Sanjata* (restrained). [19]
When the text says "Sanjata," it should be understood as referring to the *Sayogika Kevali* (liberated with the body) and those who are restrained. This is because the possibility of this bondage-place for the *Ayogika Kevali* (liberated without the body) is not mentioned.

[1.9-2.23] The location of the binding of the soul in the Chuliya
[279 The ten locations of the binding of the Mohaniya Karma - twenty-two, twenty-one, seventeen, thirteen, nine, five, four, three, two, and one. ||20||
There are ten binding locations for the Mohaniya Karma - twenty-two, twenty-one, seventeen, thirteen, nine, five, four, three, two, and one. ||20||
Of these, the twenty-two binding locations are - Mithyatva, the sixteen Kashayas, one of the three Vedas (Striveda, Purushaveda, and Napumsakaved), one of the two pairs (Hasyarati and Arati-Shok), and one of the two (Bhaya and Dugucha). ||21||
The ten binding locations mentioned above for the Mohaniya Karma are as follows: The twenty-two binding locations are - Mithyatva, the sixteen Kashayas, one of the three Vedas (Striveda, Purushaveda, and Napumsakaved), one of the two pairs (Hasyarati and Arati-Shok), and one of the two (Bhaya and Dugucha). ||21||
Mithyatva and the sixteen Kashayas, including Anantanubandhi, are the seventeen Dhruvabandhi (permanent binding) Prakruti. This is because, while they are mutually exclusive in terms of their arising, they are not mutually exclusive in terms of their binding. Therefore, the Sutras do not use the term "Ekatar" for them. The term "Ekatar" is used for the three Vedas (Striveda, Purushaveda, and Napumsakaved) and the two pairs (Hasyarati and Arati-Shok) because they are mutually exclusive in terms of their arising as well as their binding. The absence of the term "Ekatar" for Bhaya and Dugucha indicates that these two Prakruti are not mutually exclusive in terms of their binding. These twenty-two Prakruti are bound in a single state of mind.
This twenty-two-fold Mohaniya binding is first experienced by the Mithyadristi. ||22||
This is because Mithyatva, when it arises, binds the Mithyadristi soul, but does not bind elsewhere. Therefore, the Mithyadristi soul is the owner of this twenty-two-fold binding location, which is associated with the arising of Mithyatva. There are six (6) breaks in the binding. This is because, at a given time, a soul can only be bound by one of the three Vedas and one of the two pairs (Hasyarati and Arati-Shok).
Of these, the twenty-one-fold binding is experienced by the Napumsakaved. ||23||

Page #405:
---------------------------
##  [280] The Six-Part World and the Binding of the Soul

[1, 9-2, 24]  Of the ten binding places related to the Mohaniya Karma, the second binding place consists of twenty-one natures, excluding Mithyatva and Napumsakaved, from the twenty-two natures of the first binding place. ||23||

The sixteen Kshayas, either Strived or Purushaved, one of the two Veds, either one of the two pairs of Hasyarati and Arati-Shok, and either one of the two of Bhaya and Jugupsa, these twenty-one natures are bound in the soul with a single feeling. ||24||

Here, there are four divisions (242=4) due to the choice of the two Veds and the two pairs of Hasyarati etc.

This second binding place of twenty-one natures belongs to the one with Sasadan Samyagdristi. ||25||

Because, from the second Gunasthan onwards, the binding of the Anantanubandhi Chatushk and Strived does not occur. The reason for this is that the Anantanubandhi Chatushk cannot arise in the subsequent Gunasthanas of Samyagmithyadristi etc.

In this, the seventeenth place, the Anantanubandhi Krodha, Mana, Maya, Lobha, and Strived are reduced. ||26||

The twelve Kshayas of Apratyakhyana Avaraniya, Purushaved, one of the two pairs of Hasyarati and Arati-Shok, and either one of the two of Bhaya and Jugupsa, these seventeen natures are bound in the soul with a single feeling. ||27||

This seventeenth binding place belongs to the one with Samyagmithyadristi or Asanjad Samyagdristi. ||28||

Because, from the fourth Gunasthan onwards, the binding of the Apratyakhyana Avaraniya Chatushk, which is bound along with its arising, does not occur. Therefore, the two Gunasthanas of Samyagmithyadristi and Asanjad Samyagdristi are the owners of this binding place with seventeen natures.

Jīvaṭṭhāṇa - Cūliyāe Ṭhāṇasamukkittanaṁ
[281
There, this thirteenth-natured fourth bandha-sthāna is attained when the four pratyakhyānāvaraṇīya krodha, māna, māyā and lobha, which are among the seventeen types of the third bandha-sthāna, are reduced. ||29||
The eight kṣayās, puruṣavedo, hāsya-rati and arati-śoka, one of these two pairs, bhaya and durgucchā, these thirteen types are bound in the same state of being of the jīva who is being bound. ||30||
Here, there are two (2) bhangas due to the alternative of the two pairs of hāsya, etc.
That is of the saṁyata-saṁyata. ||31||
The said thirteenth-natured fourth bandha-sthāna is of the saṁyata-saṁyata. ||31||
Because, since there is no possibility of its arising beyond the fifth guṇa-sthāna, there is no possibility of the binding of the four pratyakhyānāvaraṇas there.
There, this ninth-natured fifth bandha-sthāna is attained when the four pratyakhyānāvaraṇīya krodha, māna, māyā and lobha kṣayās, which are among the thirteen types of the fourth bandha-sthāna, are reduced. ||32||
The four saṁjvalana kṣayās, puruṣavedo, hāsya-rati and arati-śoka, one of these two pairs, bhaya and durgucchā, these nine types are bound in the same state of being of the jīva who is being bound. ||33||
6. 36
Here, there are only two (2) bhangas due to the alternative of the two pairs of hāsya, etc.
That is of the saṁyata. ||34||
That ninth-natured fifth bandha-sthāna is of the saṁyata. ||34||
Here, by saying 'saṁyata', one should understand only those who are saṁyata from the pramatta-saṁyata onwards up to the apūrva-karaṇa guṇa-sthāna, because, the binding of the six nokṣayās does not occur above that. Therefore, there is no possibility of this ninth-natured bandha-sthāna further on.

##  [282] The Six-Part Bandha-sthana (Bonding-Place) of the Jiva

[1,9-2,35 - There, in this five-part bandha-sthana, the five-part bandha-sthana is reduced by the five-part bandha-sthana, namely, laughter-delight, aversion-sorrow, fear, and disgust. || 35 ||
The fifth bandha-sthana, consisting of the nine types mentioned in the ten bandha-sthana related to the mohaniya karma, is reduced by laughter-delight, aversion-sorrow, fear, and disgust, resulting in the sixth bandha-sthana with five types. ||
The four kṣayās, namely, sanjvalana (agitation), krodha (anger), māna (pride), māyā (deceit), and lobha (greed), and puruṣaved (malevolent knowledge), these five types, are bound together in a single state of the jiva. || 36 ||
This sixth bandha-sthana with five types is experienced by the jiva from the state of pramatta-samyata (inattentive restraint) to the state of anivṛtti-karaṇa (non-reversal). || 37 ||
There, in this four-part bandha-sthana, the four-part bandha-sthana is reduced by puruṣaved. || 38 ||
The sixth bandha-sthana, consisting of the five types mentioned in the ten bandha-sthana related to the mohaniya karma, is reduced by puruṣaved, resulting in the seventh bandha-sthana with four types. ||
The four kṣayās, namely, sanjvalana (agitation), krodha (anger), māna (pride), māyā (deceit), and lobha (greed), these four types, are bound together in a single state of the jiva. || 39 ||
This seventh bandha-sthana with four types is experienced by the jiva from the state of pramatta-samyata (inattentive restraint) to the state of anivṛtti-karaṇa (non-reversal). || 40 ||
There, in this three-part bandha-sthana, the three-part bandha-sthana is reduced by sanjvalana (agitation). || 41 ||
The seventh bandha-sthana, consisting of the four types mentioned in the ten bandha-sthana related to the mohaniya karma, is reduced by sanjvalana (agitation), resulting in the eighth bandha-sthana with three types. ||
Māna-sanjvalana (agitation of pride), māyā-sanjvalana (agitation of deceit), and lobha-sanjvalana (agitation of greed), these three types, are bound together in a single state of the jiva. || 42 ||
This eighth bandha-sthana with three types is experienced by the jiva from the state of pramatta-samyata (inattentive restraint) to the state of anivṛtti-karaṇa (non-reversal). || 43 ||

Page #408:
---------------------------
[1, 9-2, 53] In the collection of the places of the soul,
[283] There, this two-natured ninth bondage is the result of reducing the *manasamjalana* from the three natures of the eighth bondage, which is related to the *mohaniya* karma. ||44||
*Mayasamjalana* and *lobhasamjalana*, these two natures are bound in the same state of the soul. ||45||
That ninth bondage with two natures is of the restrained soul. ||46||
There, this one-natured tenth bondage is the result of reducing the *mayasamjalana* from the two natures of the ninth bondage, which is related to the *mohaniya* karma. ||47||
*Lobhasamjalana*, this one nature is bound in the same state of the soul. ||48||
That tenth bondage with one nature is of the restrained soul. ||49||
There are four natures of the *ayu* karma. ||50||
*Nirakayau*, *tiryagayau*, *manushyayau*, and *devayau*; these are the four natures of the *ayu* karma. ||51||
The soul who is bound by the *nirayayau* karma is in the same state. ||52||
That bondage is of the *mithyadristi* soul. ||53||
That one-natured bondage of *nirayayau* is only of the *mithyadristi* soul, because without the arising of the *mithyatva* karma, there is no bondage of *nirayayau*.

[Translation with Jain terms preserved]

[284] Jivatthanam in Chakkhandagama
[1, 9-2, 54] That tiryagayu karma which is being bound, the abode of the living being is one and the same. || 54 ||
That is either of the mithyadrsti or the sasadana-samyagdrsti. || 55 ||
The reason is that the bondage-prone dispositions of tiryagayu are found in these two gunastanas (spiritual stages) only.

[56] That manusyayu karma which is being bound, the abode of the living being is one and the same. || 56 ||
That is either of the mithyadrsti, sasadana-samyagdrsti or asanyata-samyagdrsti. || 57 ||

[58] That devayu karma which is being bound, the abode of the living being is one and the same. || 58 ||
That is either of the mithyadrsti, sasadana-samyagdrsti, asanyata-samyagdrsti, sanyatasanyata or sanyata. || 59 ||
Here, the term 'sanyata' should be understood to include the gunastanas up to the apramatta (vigilant) stage, as no ayus (life-span) can be bound beyond that.

[60] The eight bondage-abodes (bandhasthanas) of namakarma are - ekatrimsaprakrtika, trimsaprakrtika, ekunatrimsaprakrtika, astavinsaprakrtika, chatvimsaprakrtika, pancavimsaprakrtika, tevimsaprakrtika and ekaprakrtika. || 60 ||

[61] Among these, the twenty-eight bondage-abodes of the astavinsaprakrtika are - niraya-gati, pancendriya-jati, udviya-teja-karmayika-sarira, hundasamsthanam, vaikriya-sarira-angopanga, varna-gandha-rasa-sparsa, niraya-gati-prayogyanupurvi, aguru-alagu-upaghat-paraghat-utsasana, aprasasta-vihayogati, sthavara-badara-paryapta-prapteyasarira, asthira, asukha, duhsvara, dussara, anadeyya, ajasakkitti, nirmana-nama. The bondage of these twenty-eight prakrtis occurs in one and the same (gunasthana). || 61 ||

Chakkhandagame Jivadvanam
[1, 9-2, 65]
In one moment, since only one prakrti can be bound at a time, there are four thousand six hundred and eight (6×6x2x2x2x2x2x2x2=4608) modifications.
The first thirty-two prakrtis of the tiryaggatipancendriyaparyaptaujjvotasaṃyuktam bandhamānasya, that is, of the mithyadrṣṭi who binds the tiryaggatipancendriyaparyaptaujjvotasaṃyuktam. || 65 ||

In that, this is the second thirty-two prakrtis - tiryaggatipancendriyajati, audarikasarira, tejaskarmasarira, excluding hundaṃsṭhāna, any one of the remaining five sthānas; excluding asaṃprāptasaṃhaṭanasaṃghāṭana, any one of the remaining five saṃghāṭanas; varna, gandha, rasa, sparśa, tiryaggatiprayogyānupūrvī, agurulaghu, upagghāta, paragghāta, uccvāsa, ujjvota, any one of the two vihāyogatis; trasa, sādara, paryāpta, pratikaśarīra, sthira and asthira, any one of the two; śubha and aśubha, any one of the two; subhaga and duḥbhaga, any one of the two; susvara and duḥsvara, any one of the two; ādeya and anādeya, any one of the two; yaśaḥkīrti and ayaśaḥkīrti, any one of the two; and nāmakarma.

Tiryaggathi, Vikal-Indriya, Paryapt, and Udyot-Sanjutt, is the bondage of the Mithyadristi Jiva. || 69 ||

In this, the first twenty-nine-natured bondage, is like the first thirty-natured bondage, except that Udyot is to be excluded. These twenty-nine-natured bonds are established in one state. || 70 ||

Tiryaggathi, Panch-Indriya, and Paryapt-Sanjutt, is the bondage of the Mithyadristi Jiva. || 71 ||

##  [288] The Six-Part Agama on the Abodes of Life

[1, 9-2, 73] The **bandha-sthāna** (bond-place) is the second of the twenty-nine **prakr̥tis** (natures) and is similar in nature to the second of the thirty **prakr̥tis**. The special feature here is that one should abandon the **udyota** (radiance) **prakr̥ti**. These second twenty-nine **prakr̥tis** reside in one and the same state. || 72 ||

The **tiryag-gati** (animal realm) bound by the five senses and **paryāpta** (sufficient) **nāma-karma** (name-karma) belongs to the **sāsādana-samyag-dṛṣṭi** (right-seeing with the aid of a teacher) being. || 73 ||

Here, this **bandha-sthāna**, the second of the twenty-nine, is like the second of the thirty in its **bhanga** (breaking), just as the **navari** (nine) is like the **vañja** (deception). This second of the twenty-nine is a single **paḍīṇa** (state) and a single **hāṇa** (loss). || 74 ||

This **bandha-sthāna**, the third of the twenty-nine, is similar in nature to the third of the thirty **bandha-sthānas** in the **tiryag-gati** (animal realm) bound by the **nāma-karma** (name-karma) and is a single **paḍīṇa** (state) and a single **hāṇa** (loss).

[1.9-2.80] The twenty-five **Bandha-sthana** (bond-places) of the **Jiva** (soul) in the **Tiryancha** (animal) realm are:

Here, **badar** (gross) and **sukshma** (subtle), **pratyek** (individual) and **sadharan** (common) **sharira** (body), **thira** (stable) and **athira** (unstable), **shubha** (auspicious) and **ashubha** (inauspicious), and **yasha** (fame) **kirti** (glory) and **ayasha** (infamy) **kirti**; these opposing **prakriti** (nature) create thirty-two (2x2x2x2x2=32) **bhang** (divisions).

The **Tiryancha** bound by **Mithyadrishti** (false belief) is combined with one of the following: **Ekaindriya** (one-sense) **jati** (species), **Paryapta** (sufficient), **Badar** (gross), and **sukshma** (subtle). || 79 ||

This **Bandha-sthana** (bond-place) is not found in the subsequent **Sasa-dan** (sixteen) and other **guna-sthana** (quality-places).

## The Second Twenty-Five-Natured Bond-Place

This is the second twenty-five-natured bond-place among the five bond-places related to the Tiryancha-gati (animal realm) in the Name-Karma. It is the Tiryancha-gati; one of the four types of beings: Dvi-indriya (two-sense), Tri-indriya (three-sense), Chatur-indriya (four-sense), and Pancha-indriya (five-sense); Audarik-sharira (gross body), Taijas-sharira (luminous body), Karman-sharira (karmic body), Hund-sthana (a type of body), Audarik-sharira-angopaanga (parts of the gross body), Asamprapta-sripatika-sharira-sanhanan (a type of body), Varna (color), Gandha (smell), Rasa (taste), Sparsha (touch), Tiryancha-gati-prayogya-anupurvi (a type of karma), Aguru-alagha (heavy-light), Upghata (injury), Tras (fear), Badar (subtle), Aparayapta (inadequate), Pratyek-sharira (individual body), Asthir (unstable), Ashubha (inauspicious), Durbhaga (unfortunate), Anadeya (unworthy), Ayasha-kirti (bad reputation), and Nirman (creation) Name-Karma. These twenty-five natures are present in a single state. || 80 ||

Here, there are four (4) bhangas (breaks) due to the alternatives of the four types of beings: Dvi-indriya, etc. The Tiryancha-gati, combined with Tras and Aparayapta, is the bond-place for the Mithyadrishti (false-belief) being. || 81 ||

## The Twenty-Third Bond-Place

This is the twenty-third bond-place among the five bond-places related to the Tiryancha-gati in the Name-Karma. It is the Tiryancha-gati, Eka-indriya (one-sense), Audarik-sharira, Taijas-sharira, Karman-sharira, Hund-sthana, Varna, Gandha, Rasa, Sparsha, Tiryancha-gati-prayogya-anupurvi, Aguru-alagha, Upghata, Thavara (stationary), Badar, and Sukshma (subtle) - one of these two, Aparayapta, Pratyek-sharira, and Sadharan-sharira (common body) - one of these two, Asthir, Ashubha, Durbhaga, Anadeya, Ayasha-kirti, and Nirman Name-Karma. These twenty-three natures are present in a single state. Here, there are four (4) bhangas due to the alternatives of the two pairs: Badar-Sukshma and Pratyek-sharira-Sadharan-sharira. || 82 ||

This twenty-third bond-place is for the Mithyadrishti being, combined with Eka-indriya, Aparayapta, and one of the two: Badar and Sukshma. || 83 ||

There are three bond-places related to the Manusha-gati (human realm) in the Name-Karma: the thirty-natured, the twenty-nine-natured, and the twenty-five-natured. || 84 ||

## The Thirty-Natured Bond-Place

This is the thirty-natured bond-place. It is the Manusha-gati, Pancha-indriya, Audarik-sharira, Taijas-sharira, Karman-sharira,

Here is the English translation, preserving the Jain terms:

[294]
In the Chakkhandagama, the abodes of the Jivas
[1, 9-2, 97]

The one abode of the thirty-one prakritis (intrinsic natures) is:
Vaikriyika-sharira-angopanga (transformable body and its parts), Aharika-sharira-angopanga (food-transformed body and its parts), Varna (color), Gandha (odor), Rasa (taste), Sparsha (touch), Devagati-prayogya-anupurvi (the sequence of attaining divine state), Aguru-alagu (heavy-light), Upaghat (injury), Paraghat (harming others), Ucchvasa (respiration), Prashasta-vihayogati (excellent celestial movement), Trasa (mobile), Badara (gross), Paryapta (complete), Pratyeka-sharira (individual body), Sthira (stable), Shubha (auspicious), Subhaga (handsome), Sussvara (melodious voice), Aadheya (worthy of acceptance), Yashas-kirti (fame and glory), Nirmana (creation) and Tirthankara (ford-maker); these thirty-one prakritis have one common state of existence.

Devagati-panchindiya-paryapta-ahara-tirthankara-samyukta bandhamana-ssa tam appamatta-samjata-ssa va apurvakaran-assa va. (97)
This thirty-one-prakruti-bandhasthana (abode of karmic bondage) binds the devagati (divine state) associated with panchindriyas (five senses), paryapta (complete), ahara-sharira (food-transformed body) and Tirthankara-nama-karma (the karmic potential to become a ford-maker) for the unpretentious-restrained or the innovative-restrained.

Tattham imam tisaaya thaana yatha ekattisaaya bhango, navari viseso tirthayaram vajja. Dasim tisaaya payadinam ekkamhi cheva dvaana. (98)
This thirty-prakruti-bandhasthana is similar to the ekattisaya-bandhasthana (abode of twenty-one prakritis) in terms of the prakruti-bhanga (division of prakritis), except that the Tirthankara prakruti is to be excluded. The abode of these thirty prakritis is one and the same.

Devagadi-panchindiya-paryapta-ahara-samyutta-bandhamana-ssa tam appamatta-samjata-ssa va apurvakaran-assa va. (99)
This thirty-prakruti-bandhasthana binds the devagati associated with panchindriyas, paryapta and ahara-sharira for the unpretentious-restrained or the innovative-restrained.

Tattham imam padhama-egunisaaya dvaana yatha ekattisaaya bhango, navari viseso ahara-sarira-vajja. Edaasim padhama-egunisaaya payadinam ekkamhi cheva dvaana. (100)
This first twenty-nine-prakruti-bandhasthana is similar to the ekattisaya-bandhasthana in terms of the prakruti-bhanga, except that the ahara-sharira and its associated angopanga are to be excluded. The abode of these first twenty-nine prakritis is one and the same.

Devagadi-panchindiya-paryapta-tirthankara-samyutta-bandhamana-ssa tam appamatta-samjata-ssa va apurvakaran-assa va. (101)

[1.9-2.105]  The enumeration of the bonds in the Jiva-sthana-chuliya

[295] The twenty-ninth nature of the bond related to the devagati is: devagati, panchendriya-jati, vaikriyika-sharira, tejasa-sharira, karma-sharira, sama-chaturasra-samsthana, vaikriyika-sharira-ango-pang, varna, gandha, rasa, sparsa, devagati-prayogana-anupurvi, aguru-alagu, upghata, parghata, ussasa, prashasta-vihayoga-gati, tras, badar, paryatpta, pratyek-sharira, sthira or asthira (one of these two), subha or asubha (one of these two), subhaga, susvara, adeya, yasa-kirti or ayasa-kirti (one of these two), nimina and titthaya-karma. These twenty-nine natures are bound in one and the same way. ||102||

Here, there are eight (24242=8) types of destruction due to the alternatives of sthira-asthira, subha-asubha, and yasa-kirti-ayasa-kirti.

The devagati, which is bound by the panchendriya-jati, paryatpta, and titthaya-karma, is bound by the asanyata-samyag-drishti or the sanjata-asanyata. ||103||

Here, the first twenty-eight natures of the bond are: devagati, panchendriya-jati, vaikriyika-sharira, tejasa-sharira, karma-sharira, sama-chaturasra-samsthana, vaikriyika-sharira-ango-pang, varna, gandha, rasa, sparsa, devagati-prayogana-anupurvi, aguru-alagu, upghata, parghata, ussasa, prashasta-vihayoga-gati, tras, badar, paryatpta, pratyek-sharira, sthira, subha, subhaga, susvara, adeya, yasa-kirti, and nimina-karma. These twenty-eight natures are bound in one and the same way. ||104||

Here, there is no bond of ayasa-kirti, because it is destroyed in the pramatta-sanjata guna-sthana.

The devagati, which is bound by the panchendriya-jati and paryatpta, is bound by the apramatta-sanjata or the apuva-karana. ||105||

[296] **Chakkhandagama Jivatthanam**

[1, 9-2, 106] The first twenty-eight **prakriti** bonds are for those bound to the **devagati** (heavenly realm) with five senses, **jati** (birth), and **paryapta** (sufficient) **namakarma** (karma of name and form), and are experienced by those who are **aprammatasanyata** (attentive and restrained) and **apurvakaranasanyata** (restrained from creating new karma). || 105 ||

Here, in these twenty-eight **prakriti** bonds, there are two aspects: **devagati**, five senses, **jati**, **vaikriyika** (changeable) body, **tejas** (luminous) body, **karman** (karmic) body, **samachaturasasansthan** (square-shaped body), **vaikriyika** body parts, **varna** (color), **gandha** (smell), **rasa** (taste), **sparsa** (touch), **devagatiprayoganupurvi** (previous experience of heavenly realms), **aguru** (heavy), **alagu** (light), **upghat** (harm), **parghat** (external harm), **uccvas** (exhalation), **prasasta vihayogati** (excellent liberation), **tras** (fear), **badar** (obstruction), **paryapta** (sufficient), **pratyekasarira** (individual body), **thira** (stable) and **athira** (unstable) - one of these two, **subha** (auspicious) and **asubha** (inauspicious) - one of these two, **subhaga** (beautiful), **susvara** (sweet voice), **adeya** (worthy of respect), **yasha** (fame) and **ayasha** (infamy) - one of these two, and **nimina** (creation) **namakarma**. These twenty-eight **prakriti** bonds are experienced in one state. || 106 ||

Here, there are eight **bhangas** (divisions) due to the alternatives of **thira** (stable), **subha** (auspicious), and **yasha** (fame) (242428).

For those bound to the **devagati** with five senses and **paryapta** (sufficient) **namakarma**, it is either **mithyadristi** (false belief), **sasadan samyagdristi** (right belief with wrong conduct), **samyagmithyadristi** (right belief with wrong conduct), **asanyatasamyagdristi** (right belief with unrestrained conduct), **sanyatasanyata** (restrained and unrestrained), or **sanyata** (restrained). || 107 ||

Here, the term **sanyata** (restrained) should be understood as **aprammatasanyata** (attentive and restrained), because those who are **sanyata** (restrained) in the higher **gunasthanas** (stages of spiritual progress) do not experience the bonds of **athira** (unstable), **asubha** (inauspicious), and **ayasha** (infamy).

Here, in these five **bandhasthanas** (bonds) related to **devagati** (heavenly realm) due to **namakarma** (karma of name and form), there is one **prakriti** bond related to **yasha** (fame) **namakarma**. This one **prakriti** bond is experienced in one state. || 108 ||

This one **prakriti** bond is experienced by those who are **sanyata** (restrained) and bound to this one **yasha** (fame) **prakriti**. || 109 ||

[1, 9-2, 117]  In the Jiva-sthana-chulika, the aggregation of the karmas is explained.
[297] Here, the term "sanjata" refers to the Jivas who have attained the seventh stage of the Gunasthana, starting from the A-purvakarana Gunasthana and ending at the Sukshma-samparaya Gunasthana. The reason for this is that all the types of karma, except for the Yashas-kirti karma, are severed from bondage in the sixth stage of the A-purvakarana Gunasthana. The Yashas-kirti karma, however, remains bound until the Sukshma-samparaya Gunasthana, but not beyond.
There are two types of Gotra karma: Uccha-gotra and Nicha-gotra. [110]
The Nicha-gotra karma is a single-natured bondage. [111]
This bondage of Nicha-gotra karma occurs in Jivas who are either Mithyadrishti or Sasadan-samyagdristi. [112]
The reason for this is that there is no further bondage of Nicha-gotra karma beyond this point.
The Uccha-gotra karma is a single-natured bondage. [113]
This bondage of Uccha-gotra karma occurs in Jivas who are either Mithyadrishti, Sasadan-samyagdristi, Samyag-mithyadrishti, Asanjat-samyagdristi, Sanjata-asanjat, or Sanjat. [114]
There are five types of Antaraya karma: Dana-antaraya, Laabha-antaraya, Bhoga-antaraya, Paribhoga-antaraya, and Viriya-antaraya. [115]
These five types of Antaraya karma have a single nature. [116]
This bondage of the five Antaraya karmas occurs in Jivas who are either Mithyadrishti, Sasadan-samyagdristi, Samyag-mithyadrishti, Asanjat-samyagdristi, Sanjata-asanjat, or Sanjat. [117]
Here, the term "Sanjat" should be understood to refer to Jivas who have attained the tenth stage of the Gunasthana.
|| The second chulika, named "Sthana-samutkirtan", ends here. || 2 ||

1. The soul binds the following karmas when it is inclined towards the first right faith (prathamopasham samyaktva):
Panchananavaraniya (five knowledge-obscuring and nine faith-obscuring karmas), Sadavedniya (pleasant feeling-producing karma), Mithyatva (wrong belief), Sholasankashaya (sixteen passions like anger, pride, deceit, greed), Purushaaveda (male sex), Hasya (laughter), Rati (attachment), Bhaya (fear), and Jugupsa (disgust). However, it does not bind the Ayu (life-span) karma.

2. It also binds the karmas related to Devagati (celestial birth), Panchendriya-jati (five-sensed existence), Vaikriyika (transformable) body, Taijasa (fiery) body, Karmana (karmic) body, Samachaturashshrasansthan (square-shaped physique), Vaikriyikangopanga (transformable body-limbs), Varna-gandha-rasa-sparsha (color, smell, taste, touch), Devagatiprayayogyanupurvi (sequence of celestial births), Agurulaghu (heavy-light), Upghata (injury), Parghata (destruction), Uchchwasa (breathing), Prashastavihayogati (auspicious flying), Trasa (mobile), Badara (gross), Paryapta (complete), Pratyekasharira (individual body), Sthira (stable), Shubha (auspicious), Subhaga (handsome), Sussvara (melodious voice), Aadeya (respectable), Yashaskirti (fame), Nirmana (creation), and Uchcha-gotra (high family).

3. However, it does not bind the karmas related to Asatavedniya (unpleasant feeling-producing), Striveda (female sex), Napunsaka-veda (neuter sex), Arati (dispassion), Shoka (sorrow), Naragati (hell birth), Tiryagagati (animal birth), Manushyagati (human birth), Ekendriya-jati (one-sensed existence) to Chaturindriya-jati (four-sensed existence), Audārika (gross physical) body, Āhāraka (food-transformed) body, Nyagrodhaparimandala-sansthāna (banyan-tree-like physique) to Hundaka-sansthāna (hunchback physique), Audārikāngopānga (gross physical body-limbs) to Āhārikāngopānga (food-transformed body-limbs), Shanashanana (six types of binding), Naragatiprayayogyanupurvi (sequence of hell births) to Manushyagatiprayayogyanupurvi (sequence of human births), Atapa (scorching), Udyota (glowing), Aprashastavihāyogati (inauspicious flying), Sthāvara (immobile), Sūkshma (subtle), Aparyāpta (incomplete), Sādhāraṇa-sharīra (common body), Asthira (unstable), Ashubha (inauspicious), Durabhaga (unattractive), Duhssvara (unmelodious voice), Anādeya (disrespectable), Ayaḥ-kīrti (infamy), Tīrthaṃkara (omniscient teacher), and Nīcha-gotra (low family). This is because the soul has attained the purest state of right faith.

## Jiva-Chuliyae Vidio Maha-Dandao
**4. Chauthi Chuliya**

This is the second Maha-Dandak worthy of being known. || 1 ||
[1, 9-4, 2]

The five Jnana-Avaraniya, the nine Darsana-Avaraniya, the seven Vedaniya, the Mithyatva, the sixteen Kasaya, Purusha-Ved, Hasya, Rati, Bhaya, and Jugupsa; these natures bind, but not the Ayu Karma. Manushya-Gati, Panchendriya-Jati, Audarik-Sharira, Tejas-Sharira, Karma-Sharira, Sama-Chaturasra-Santhan, Audarik-Sharira-Ango-Pang, Vajra-Rishabha-Naracha-Sanhanan, Varna, Gandha, Rasa, Sparsha, Manushya-Gati-Prayogya-Anupurvi, Aguru-Alaghu, Upghata, Parghata, Ucchvasa, Prashasta-Vihayo-Gati, Tras, Badar, Paryapt, Pratyek-Sharira, Thira, Shubha, Subhaga, Sukhara, Aadeya, Yash-Kirti, Nirman, Uccha-Gotra, and the five Antaraya; these natures bind. || 2 ||

The word 'cha' used in the sentence 'Ayu-gam cha na bandhadi' indicates that along with the four Ayus, the following should also be included: Asata-Vedaniya, Stri-Ved, Napumsak-Ved, Arati, Shoka, Naraka-Gati, Tiryanch-Gati, Deva-Gati, Ekendriya-Jati, Dwi-Indriya-Jati, Tri-Indriya-Jati, Chatur-Indriya-Jati, Vaikriya-Sharira, Aharak-Sharira, Sama-Chaturasra-Santhan excluding the remaining five Santhan, Vaikriya-Sharira-Ango-Pang, Aharak-Sharira-Ango-Pang, Vajra-Rishabha-Naracha-Sanhanan excluding the remaining five Sanhanan, Naraka-Gati-Prayogya-Anupurvi, Tiryanch-Gati-Prayogya-Anupurvi, Deva-Gati-Prayogya-Anupurvi, Aprashasta-Vihayo-Gati, Atap, Udyot, Sthavar, Sukshma, Aparyapt, Sadharan-Sharira, Asthira, Ashubha, Durbhaga, Duhsvara, Anadeya, Ayash-Kirti, Nicha-Gotra, and Tirthankara.

These are all the natures that the Dev, who has attained the first stage of liberation (Prathama-Upshama-Samyak-Tvaka), does not bind, except for the Naraki Jivas of the seventh earth.

## Jatta - Dhūliyā Ukkassatthidiparūpaṇā
6. Chatti Chūliyā

Whether the hasarora karma is obtained or not obtained, the explanation of "not obtained" is given. || 1 ||

[1, 9-6, 6]

By the karma of how many periods of existence does the jiva attain samyaktva, or by the karma of how many periods of existence does he not attain it? Under this question sentence, the explanation of the phrase "or not obtained" is given. || 1 ||

Describing those states, the Acharya first says the Uttar Sutra for the description of the excellent state of karma:

Etto Ukkassaddiṁ Vaṇṇaislāmo || 2 ||

Now, the description of the excellent state will be given. || 2 ||

[30.1

According to the kṣaya of the pudgala skandha, which has transformed due to the power of yoga, the time for which it remains in one form with the jiva is called the state. It is of many types, excellent, inferior, and medium. Here, the excellent state of karma is described.

1

That is as follows. || 3 ||

Pañcaṁhaṁ ṇāṇāvaraṇīyāṇam navaṁhaṁ darsaṇāvaraṇīyāṇam asādāvedanīyaṁ pañcaṁhaṁ antarāiyāṇam ukkasaṁ dvi-dibandho tīsaṁ sāgarovaṁ kodākoḍīo || 4 ||

The excellent state-bond of the five knowledge-obscuring, nine vision-obscuring, non-pleasant-feeling, and five hindrance karmas is like thirty koḍakoḍi sāgaras. || 4 ||

Now, the measure of their time of non-obstruction is indicated: Tiṇṇa vāsa sahasāṇi ābādhā. || 5 ||

The time of non-obstruction of the aforementioned knowledge-obscuring etc. karmas is three thousand years. || 5 ||

The time for which karma does not begin to give its fruit after being bound is called the time of non-obstruction. This excellent time of non-obstruction of the aforementioned karmas has been told.

Ābādhūṇiyā kammatthadī kammaniśeo || 6 ||

The measure of the state of karma inferior to this time of non-obstruction of the aforementioned knowledge-obscuring etc. karmas is the time of karma-niśeka. || 6 ||

[302] In the Chhaṃkhāṇḍāgama, the Jīvattḥāṇa (Abodes of Living Beings)

[1, 9-6, 7] The maximum duration of the bondage of the sātāvedanīya (pleasant feeling), strīveda (female sex), manuṣyagati (human state of existence) and manuṣyagatiprāyogyānupūrvī (the successive stages of the human state of existence) karmas is fifteen koḍākoḍi sāgaropama. [7]

The duration of the ābandhā (affliction) of these four karmas is fifteen hundred years. [8]

The duration of the karmasthiti (state of karma) less than the ābandhā duration is the karmaniseka (dissociation) of those karmas. [9]

The maximum duration of the bondage of the mithyātva (false belief) karma is seventy koḍākoḍi sāgaropama. [10]

The duration of the ābandhā of the mithyātva karma is seven thousand years. [11]

The duration of the karmasthiti less than the ābandhā duration is the karmaniseka of the mithyātva karma. [12]

The maximum duration of the bondage of the sixteen kaṣāyas (passions) like anantānubandhī (uninterrupted attachment) is forty koḍākoḍi sāgaropama. [13]

The duration of the ābandhā of the sixteen kaṣāyas is four thousand years. [14]

The duration of the karmasthiti less than the ābandhā duration is the karmaniseka of the sixteen kaṣāyas. [15]

The maximum duration of the bondage of the puruṣaveda (male sex), hāsya (laughter), rati (pleasure), devagati (divine state of existence), samacatuḥśraṃsaṃsthāna (regular quadrangular form), vajraṛṣabhanārācasaṃhanana (diamond, bull and pike-like body), devagatiprāyogyānupūrvī (the successive stages of the divine state of existence), praśasta vihāyogati (auspicious celestial movement), sthira (stable), śubha (auspicious), subhaga (handsome), sussvara (melodious voice), ādeya (worthy of respect), yaśaḥkīrti (fame) and uccagodāna (high family) karmas is ten koḍākoḍi sāgaropama.

##  [304]

**The duration of the lifespan of beings in the six realms**

[1,9-6,24]

The lifespan of humans and animals bound by the karma of hell and heaven is one *purva-koti* years. Their next lifespan is bound after two-thirds (3) of their current lifespan has passed. Therefore, the remaining one-third (3) of their current lifespan at the time of binding their next birth is the *utkrista* (best) obstacle time for the *utkrista* state of hell and heaven. Their *jghana* (worst) obstacle time is their *asankshepadha* time. All the options between the *asankshepadha* time and the *purva-koti* time are the medium obstacles.

**Obstacle** || 24 || Within the aforementioned obstacle time, the *nisheka-sthiti* (state of binding) of hell and heaven is free from obstacles. ||

Just as the *karma* of *jnana-avaran* (knowledge obscuration) etc., which are time-bound, cause obstacles through *apkarshana* (decline), *utkarshana* (rise), and *paraprakriti-sankraman* (transition to another nature) after the binding, similarly, they do not cause obstacles in the *karma* of lifespan which is time-bound. This *sutra* (aphorism) has been composed to express this meaning.

**Karma-dvi-di karma-nisheka** || 25 || The state of *karma* of hell and heaven is their *karma-nisheka* (binding of karma). || 25 ||

**Tiryak-ayu-manusa-au-ass-ukkas-so dvi-di-bandho tin-ni palido-vamani** || 26 || The *utkrista* state binding of the lifespan of animals and humans is only three *palyopam* (like three *palyas*). || 26 ||

This is their *nisheka-sthiti* (state of binding) specified, because, only three *palyopam* is found in animals and humans as the *utkrista* state of the *oudarik* (gross) body.

**Puvy-kodi ti-bhago ava-dha** || 27 || The *utkrista* obstacle time of the lifespan of animals and humans is one-third of a *purva-koti*. || 27 ||

**Obstacle** || 28 || Within this obstacle time, the *nisheka-sthiti* (state of binding) of the lifespan of animals and humans is free from obstacles. || 28 ||

**Karma-hidi karma-nisheka** || 29 || The state of *karma* of the lifespan of animals and humans is their *karma-nisheka* (binding of karma). || 29 ||

**Vi-indiya-ti-indiya-chauri-diya-vamana-santhan-khilya-sanghanan-suham-ap-aj-jatt-sadharan-na-man-am ukkas-so hidi-bandho at-thar-as sagaro-vam-ako-da-kodi-o** || 30 ||

The *utkrista* state binding of the beings of the nature of two-sense, three-sense, four-sense, *vamana-santhan* (dwarf body), *khilya-sanghanan* (small body), *sukshma* (subtle), *apar-yapt* (insufficient), and *sadharan* (ordinary) is only eighteen *koda-kodi* *sagaro-vam* (like eighteen *koda-kodi* oceans). || 30 ||

**At-thar-as vasas-da-ni ava-dha** || 31 || The *utkrista* obstacle time of these beings of the nature of two-sense etc. is only eighteen hundred years. || 31 ||

[1, 9-8, 3]  Jīvaṭṭhāna-Cūliyāe Paḍhamasammattuppattiparūpaṇā
[311 8. Aṭṭhamī Cūliyā Evadīkālaṭṭhidiehi Kammehi Sammattam ṇa Lahadi || 1 ||  A jīva does not attain samyaktva by actions that are of limited duration. || 1 ||
This is a sūtra that indicates the country. Therefore, one should understand that a jīva does not attain samyaktva when there is a low or high state of bondage, a low or high state of sattva, a low or high state of anubhāga sattva, and a low or high state of pradeśa sattva.
Labhadi tti Vibhāsā || 2 || The word ‘Labhadi’ in the first sūtra of the first cūlikā is explained. || 2 ||
The meaning is that the nature, state, anubhāga, and pradeśa of bondage, sattva, and udiranā that a jīva attains samyaktva by, are described here.
Edesiṁ Ceva Savvakammāṇam Jāve Antokodaakoḍiṭṭhidī Bandhadi Tāve Paḍhamasammattam Labhadi || 3 ||
When this jīva binds these actions in the state of antokodaakoḍi, then it attains the first samyaktva of upaśama. || 3 ||
This sūtra describes the four attainments of kṣayopaśama, viśuddhi, deśanā, and prāyogya. The attainment of kṣayopaśama is the attainment of udiranā when the anubhāga-spardhakās of the previously accumulated karma become progressively infinitely less powerful due to viśuddhi, in every moment. The attainment of viśuddhi is the attainment of the result of the jīva, which is the cause of the bondage of the auspicious natures like sātavedanīya, etc., and the opponent of the bondage of the inauspicious natures like asātavedanīya, etc., due to the anubhāga-spardhakās that have attained udiranā in the aforementioned order. The attainment of deśanā is the teaching of the six dravyas and nine padārthas. The attainment of deśanā is the attainment of this deśanā and the ācāryas, etc., who have become transformed by it, and the attainment of the power to understand and retain the meaning taught. The attainment of prāyogya is the destruction of the highest state of all karmas, establishing them in the state of antokodaakoḍi, and the destruction of their highest anubhāgas, establishing them in the two-place form (the form of latā and dāru for the destructive karmas, and the form of nīm and kānjīra for the non-destructive inauspicious natures).
These four attainments can occur for both the bhavya and the abhavya, but the final attainment of karaṇalabdhi occurs only for the bhavya jīva - it is not possible for the abhavya.

Page #437:
---------------------------
[312] The living being who attains the first cessation of karma (prathamopaśama samyaktvako) is a five-sensed being, conscious, with false belief (mithyādr̥ṣṭi), sufficient (paryāpta), and all-purified. || 4 ||

Since the results that are fit for attaining the right faith (samyaktvako) are not possible for beings from one-sensed to five-sensed without consciousness (asaṁjñī), therefore, in the sūtra, the word 'five-sensed' (pañcindio) is used to negate them. The living beings with the false belief of the type of 'sāsādanasamyakdr̥ṣṭi', 'samyagmithyādr̥ṣṭi', 'kṣāyikasamyagdr̥ṣṭi', and 'vedakasamyagdr̥ṣṭi' do not attain the first cessation of karma (prathamopaśama samyaktvako). Therefore, in the sūtra, the word 'false belief' (mithyādr̥ṣṭi) is used to negate them. Although the living being with the false belief of the type of 'vedakasamyagdr̥ṣṭi', who is moving towards the ascent of the cessation of karma (upaśamaśreṇi), attains the cessation of karma (upaśamasamyaktvako), but because of his birth with the right faith (samyaktvako), he is not called the first cessation of karma (prathamopaśama samyaktvako). Therefore, the living being with the false belief (mithyādr̥ṣṭi) who attains the first cessation of karma (prathamopaśama samyaktvako) is only in the sufficient state (paryāpta), not in the insufficient state (aparyāpta). This is the meaning of this sūtra.

When the living being establishes the state of being equal to the number of inner-koḍakoḍi-sāgara-upamas, which are less than a thousand sāgara-upamas, by the number of all his karmas, then he attains the first right faith (prathamasamyaktvako). || 5 ||

The living being with the false belief (mithyādr̥ṣṭi) who attains the first cessation of karma (prathamopaśama samyaktvako) removes the inner-muhūrta-moha (antarmuhūrtamoha) for a period of time, i.e., he performs the inner-purification (antarakaraṇa). || 6 ||

The meaning of this is that the living being with the false belief (mithyādr̥ṣṭi) from the beginning of time (anādi), after spending the time of the lower-karma (adhaḥkaraṇa) and the previous-karma (apūrvakaraṇa) results, when he spends a large number of times related to the non-stopping-karma (anivṛttikaraṇa) results, then he performs the inner-purification (antarakaraṇa) of the false belief (mithyātvaprakṛti). The removal of the inner-muhūrta-only states (antarmuhūrtamātra sthiti) in the middle, leaving the lower and upper states of the desired karma (vivākṣita karma), is called inner-purification (antarakaraṇa) by the special result (pariṇāmaviśeṣa). While performing this inner-purification (antarakaraṇa), he crosses the inner-muhūrta-only state (antarmuhūrtamātra sthiti) of the false belief (mithyātvakarma) that arises before the time of its beginning, and performs the removal of the inner-muhūrta-only states (antarmuhūrtamātra sthiti) above it, and throws some of them into the first state (antarakaraṇase nīceki antarmuhūrtamātra sthiti) and some into the second state (antarakaraṇase ūparaki antarmuhūrtamātra sthiti). In this way, he removes the removal of the inner-muhūrta-only states (antarmuhūrtamātra sthiti) of the false belief (mithyātvaki).

He divides the strong false belief (ohāddēdr̥ṇa mithyāttāṁ) into three parts: the right belief (sammattam), the false belief (mithyāttāṁ), and the right desire (sammāmichchattāṁ). || 7 ||

[1, 9-8, 11]  Jīvaṭṭhāṇa-cūliyāe paḍhamasammattuṣpattikāraṇaparūpaṇā [313

By means of the inner organ, it makes three divisions of the karma of false belief - right belief, false belief, and mixed belief. || 7 ||

The karma of delusion of perception is subdued. || 8 ||

Where does this karma of delusion of perception get subdued? It gets subdued in all the four gatis. It gets subdued in all the four gatis, in the five-sensed beings, not in the one-sensed and the disabled-sensed beings. It gets subdued in the five-sensed beings, in the conscious beings, not in the unconscious beings. It gets subdued in the conscious beings, in the beings who have taken birth in the womb, not in the unconscious beings. It gets subdued in the beings who have taken birth in the womb, in the sufficient beings, not in the insufficient beings. It gets subdued in the sufficient beings, in the beings who have a lifespan of a countable number of years, as well as in the beings who have a lifespan of an uncountable number of years. || 9 ||

Where and in whose proximity does the subduing of the karma of delusion of perception take place? || 10 ||

The answer to this is that the subduing of the karma of delusion of perception can take place in any field and in the proximity of anyone - there is no specific rule for this.

Where does the being who begins the destruction of the karma of delusion of perception begin it? It begins it in the fifteen karma-bhūmis situated within the two and a half islands and oceans - where the Jinas, the Kevalis, or the Tirthankaras are. || 11 ||

When the sūtra says "paṇṇarasakammabhūmisū", it should be understood to mean the humans born in those fifteen karma-bhūmis, because the human is the one who begins the destruction of the karma of delusion of perception. However, its completion (ending) is possible in all the four gatis. Similarly, the word "jamhi" used in the sūtra should be understood to mean that in the time when the possibility of the Kevali Jinas exists, 
ch. 40

Page #439:
---------------------------
[314] In the **Chakkhandagama**, the **Jiva**'s state of being is described.

[1, 9-8, 12] It is said that the **Darshanamohaniya** (obstacle to right perception) begins to be destroyed. From this, one should understand that its destruction is prohibited in the **Sushma-Sushma** and other periods.

[12] However, the **Darshanamoha** (delusion of perception) is destroyed in all four **Gatis** (paths of existence).

A **Jiva** who destroys the **Darshanamohaniya** from the time of becoming **Kritakritya-Vedaka** (one who has fulfilled his purpose) onwards is called a **Nishthapaka** (one who destroys). So, he is born in all four **Gatis** under the influence of his **Purvabaddha Ayu** (predetermined lifespan) and completes the destruction of the **Darshanamohaniya**. A **Jiva** is called **Kritakritya-Vedaka** from the time he gives the **Samyaktvaprakriti** (nature of right faith) to the last **Phalika** (fruit) in the lower **Nisekas** (stages of existence) until the **Antarmuhurta** (last moment of life).

[13] The **Jiva** who attains **Samyaktv** (right faith) in relation to the **Sthitibandha** (bond of existence) and **Sthitisattva** (state of being) established by the **Sarvavishuddha Mithyadristi** (completely deluded wrong belief) establishes the **Sthiti** (state) of the seven **Karmas** (actions): **Jnanaavaraneya** (obstacle to knowledge), **Darshanavaraneya** (obstacle to perception), **Vedaniya** (karmic fruit), **Mohaniya** (delusion), **Nama** (name), **Gotra** (lineage), and **Antaraya** (obstacle), as **Antahkoda-kodi** (infinitely small).

[14] The **Jiva** who attains **Charitra** (conduct) in relation to the **Sthitibandha** and **Sthitisattva** of the **Mithyadristi** at the end of the **Prathamo-pashama Samyaktv** (first stage of right faith) establishes the **Sthiti** of the seven **Karmas**: **Jnanaavaraneya**, **Darshanavaraneya**, **Vedaniya**, **Mohaniya**, **Nama**, **Gotra**, and **Antaraya**, as **Antahkoda-kodi**.

The meaning is that the **Sthitibandha** and **Sthitisattva** of the seven **Karmas** of the **Mithyadristi** **Jiva** at the end of the **Prathamo-pashama Samyaktv** are less in number than the **Sthitibandha** and **Sthitisattva** established by the **Jiva** who is approaching **Sangha-masanyama** (control of the senses and mind). And the **Sthitibandha** and **Sthitisattva** of the **Mithyadristi** **Jiva** at the end of the **Samyama** (control) are even less in number.

[15] The **Jiva** who attains **Sampurna Charitra** (complete conduct) establishes the **Sthiti** of the four **Karmas**: **Jnanaavaraneya**, **Darshanavaraneya**, **Mohaniya**, and **Antaraya**, as **Antarmuhurta** (last moment of life), gradually reducing them.

[16] The **Vedaniya** (karmic fruit) is established as **Baras-muhurta** (twelve moments), **Nama-Gotra** (name and lineage) as **Attha-muhurta** (eight moments), and the remaining **Karmas** as **Bhinna-muhurta** (different moments).

The क्षपक वेदनीय, which obtains the complete conduct, establishes twelve मुहूर्त for the state of क्षपक वेदनीय, eight मुहूर्त for the state of name and ग्रोत्र कर्म, and a different मुहूर्त, i.e., only अन्तर्मुहूर्त, for the state of the rest. || 16 ||
|| Eighth Cūlikā is finished || 8 ||

Uppādatā Kamhi Uppādeti || 2 || In what state do the Nārakī Jīva who produce the first Samyaktva produce it? || 2 ||
Pajjattaesu Uppādenți, No Apajjattaemu || 3 || They produce it only in the पर्याप्तक, not in the अपर्याप्तक. || 3 ||
Pajjattaesu Uppādentā Antomuhuttappahuḍi Jāva Tappāoggantōmuhuttaṁ Uvarimuppaḍenti, No Hevā || 4 ||
The Nārakī who produce the first Samyaktva in the पर्याप्तक produce it from the अन्तर्मुहूर्त until the end of the suitable अन्तर्मुहूर्त, not below that. || 4 ||
The meaning is that from the first time of becoming पर्याप्तक until the time of the suitable अन्तर्मुहूर्त has passed, the Jīva cannot produce the first Samyaktva because the possibility of purification suitable for it does not exist.
Evaṁ Jāva Sattasu Puḍavīsu Neraḍyā || 5 ||
Thus, from the first पृथ्वी to the seventh पृथ्वी, the Nārakī Jīva produce the first Samyaktva. || 5 ||

---------------------------
In the six realms, some living beings attain first right knowledge due to **jati-smarana** (recollection of past lives), some due to **shravana** (hearing the Dharma), and some due to **vedana** (pain). || 8 ||

Thus, in the three upper realms, the hellish beings attain first right knowledge due to the above three causes. || 9 ||

In the four lower realms, how many causes lead the hellish beings with **mithyatva** (false belief) to attain first right knowledge? || 10 ||

They attain first right knowledge due to two causes. || 11 ||

Some attain it due to **jati-smarana** and some due to **vedana**. || 12 ||

Since the gods cannot go to the four lower realms, the hellish beings there attain first right knowledge only due to the remaining two causes, excluding **shravana**.

The **tiryanch** (animals) with **mithyatva** attain first right knowledge. || 13 ||

In what state do the **tiryanch** attain first right knowledge? || 14 ||

They attain it only in the state of **panchendriya** (five senses), not in the state of **ekendriya** (one sense) or **vigalindriya** (disabled senses). || 15 ||

Even among the **panchendriya**, they attain it only in the state of **sanjni** (conscious), not in the state of **asanjni** (unconscious). || 16 ||

Page #442:
---------------------------
[1.9-9.25] In the *Jīvaṭṭhāna-Cūliya*, the first *samyaktva* arises due to the following reasons: [317

**17.**  *Tiryāṅca* beings who are born in the womb (**gabbhovatantiesu**) produce the first *samyaktva*, not those who are born in a state of unconsciousness (**sammūcchiṃmesu**).

[1, 9-9, 43
Here, since the arrival of the gods from above does not happen, therefore their Mahardhidarshan is not possible. Along with that, their Jinmahima Darshan is also not possible, because they neither go to any Kalyanak Mahotsav of the Tirthankar nor do they go to Nandishwar Dweep during the Ashtahnik Mahotsav.

Ke micchatte adhigada sasanasammattena niti || 45 ||
Many of them enter hell with Mithyatva and leave from there with Sasadan Samyaktva || 45 ||
The meaning is that many Naraki Jivas who enter the hellish state with Mithyatva and stay there for their allotted lifespan, finally attain Prathamopa-sham Samyaktva and leave from there with Sasadan Samyaktva.
Kei micchattrena adhigada sammattena niti || 46 ||

Jivas who enter hell with Samyaktva leave from there with Samyaktva itself || 47 ||
The meaning is that many Kshayik Samyagdristi and Kritakritya Vedak Samyagdristi Jivas, due to their previous bound karma, first go to hell and leave from there with Samyaktva itself, because their Gunasthan cannot change.

The hell beings of the seventh earth exit with *mithyātvā* (false belief). || 52 ||
The reason for this is that the hell beings of the seventh earth, who have attained *samyaktvā* (right belief), *sāsādana-samyaktvā* (right belief with attachment), and *samyag-mithyātvā* (right belief with wrong conduct), attain *mithyātvā* (false belief) at the time of death.

Those who enter the *tiryanch-gati* (animal realm) with *samyaktvā* (right belief) exit with *samyaktvā* (right belief) as a rule. || 59 ||
The reason for this is that those who enter the *tiryanch-gati* (animal realm) due to their previous karma, are *kṣāyika-samyag-dṛṣṭi* (those who have attained right faith but are still subject to karma). || 6.41 ||

1.9-9.197) Regarding the devagati of the beings in the Chuliya:

[335] Coming from the paryapta humans, they come to the sankhyatavarshayuṣka, not the asankhyatavarshayuṣka. [189]

The devagati of the bhavnavasi, vanavyantar, jyotishi, and the Saudharma and Aishana kalpavasis is the same as the common devagati. [190]

From Sanatkumara up to the Shatar-Sahasrar kalpavasis, the devagati is the same as the naraka beings of the first earth. The only difference is that instead of "udvartita", one should say "chyuta". [191]

From Anata up to the Navagevayak vimānavasis, how many gatīs do the mithyadṛṣṭi, sasadan samyagdṛṣṭi, and asanjayat samyagdṛṣṭi devas come to, being chyuta from the devaparyaya? [192]

Ch. 43

Page #463:
---------------------------
[338] In the six realms, where do the beings from the fourth earth (hell) go after being released from hell? [1,9-9,214]
They go to two realms: the realm of animals (tiryanch) and the realm of humans (manushya). [214]
Of those born in the realm of animals, some develop the six (abhinibodhik jnana, etc.). [215]
Of those born in the realm of humans, some develop ten: some develop abhinibodhik jnana, some develop shruta jnana, some develop avadhi jnana, some develop manahparyaya jnana, some develop kevala jnana, some develop samyagmithyatva, some develop samyaktva, some develop samyama-asamyama, and some develop samyama. But they do not develop baldevattva, vasudevattva, chakravartattva, or tirthankartva. Some become siddhas, buddhas, muktas, attain nirvana, and some attain the end of all suffering. [216]
The use of multiple verbs like "sidhanti, bujhanti" etc. is to refute the opinions of various schools of thought. For example, Kapila Rishi believes that even after attaining kevala jnana, a being does not know all things. To refute this, the sutra uses the verb "bujhanti". It means that a being, upon becoming a siddha, knows all things, including infinite meanings and synonyms of all things, past, present, and future.
Vaisheshika, Nyaya, Sankhya, and Mimamsa schools believe that liberation means freedom from bondage. But since a being is eternal and non-material, bondage is not possible for it. So, how can it be liberated? It is impossible. To refute this, the sutra uses the verb "muchchanti".

Page #464:
---------------------------
[1, 9-8, 220]
Jīvāṇ - Cūliyāe Raiyāṇmāgadipuvvaṁ Guṇaparūvaṇā
[339 This verb is used. Its meaning is that the jīva, being bound by the anādi karmabandha in the saṁsāra state, is in some way bound, mūrtika, and in some way anitya. Therefore, it also remains connected to karmas. When it is thus realized, it gets rid of that karmabandhana.
Some logicians believe that even after the destruction of all karmabandha, the jīva does not attain ultimate happiness, because at that time, the auspicious karma that is the cause of its happiness and the inauspicious karma that is the cause of its suffering also do not remain. To refute this view, the sūtra gives the word 'pariṇivvāṇayati'. Its meaning is that the jīva experiences infinite happiness when it is freed from karmabandhana - when it is liberated. The happiness that is obtained in the saṁsāra state due to auspicious karma is accompanied by obstacles and is perishable. Therefore, it is not really happiness, but an illusion of happiness. Real (nirākul) happiness is in the absence of both auspicious and inauspicious karmas. Therefore, in the realized state, the jīva experiences infinite happiness eternally.
These logicians also believe that where there is happiness, there is also suffering by rule, because it (happiness) is inseparable from suffering - it does not exist without it. To refute this view, the sūtra says here 'savvadukkhāṇamantāṁ parivijāṇanti'. Its meaning is that the liberated jīva attains the end of all suffering. The reason is that at that time, the karmas that are the cause of that suffering are completely absent. Therefore, at that time, it attains natural eternal happiness in the form of health (ātmasthiti). Thus, it should be understood that all the words used in the sūtra are meaningful.

In the **Chakkhandaga** (Six-Part) **Gama** (Scripture), it is stated that beings (**jiva**) born in the human realm (**manushya**) experience ten different states of existence:

1. **Abhinibodhik** (Intuitive) knowledge
2. **Shruta** (Scriptural) knowledge
3. **Avadhi** (Clairvoyance) knowledge
4. **Man:paryaya** (Mind-perception) knowledge
5. **Kevala** (Omniscient) knowledge
6. **Samyagmithyatva** (Right and Wrong Belief)
7. **Samyaktva** (Right Belief)
8. **Sanjama-sanjama** (Control and Lack of Control)
9. **Sanjama** (Control)

However, they do not attain the states of:

1. **Baldev** (A type of celestial being)
2. **Vasudeva** (Another type of celestial being)
3. **Chakravartin** (Universal Monarch)
4. **Tithankara** (Founder of a Jain Tirthankara lineage)

Those who are **antarkrit** (internally purified) become **siddha** (liberated), **buddha** (enlightened), **muccita** (freed), attain **parinirvana** (final liberation), and experience the end of all suffering.

The **Soudharma** (a celestial realm) and **Aishana** (another celestial realm) realms, up to the **Shatar-sahasrar** (hundred thousand) **kalpa** (eon) of the **Sadar-sahasrar** (thousand thousand) **kalpa** (eon), have a similar path of descent as other celestial beings.

The celestial beings residing in the **Anata** (a celestial realm) and other realms up to the **Navageveyaka** (nine-storeyed) **vimana** (celestial vehicle) realms, when they fall from their celestial state, descend through how many paths?

They descend through only one path, the human path (**manushya-gadi**).

The celestial beings residing in the **Anata** (a celestial realm) and other realms up to the **Navageveyaka** (nine-storeyed) **vimana** (celestial vehicle) realms, when they fall from their celestial state and are born as humans, experience all ten states of existence.

The celestial beings residing in the **Anudisha** (a celestial realm) and other realms up to the **Avarai** (a celestial realm) **vimana** (celestial vehicle) realms, when they fall from their celestial state, descend through how many paths?

They descend through only one path, the human path (**manushya-gadi**).

This is the instruction for those who are bound. || 1 ||

Those who are bound are of four types, namely, name-bound, establishment-bound, substance-bound and feeling-bound. Among the eight types of beings mentioned earlier, the word 'bound' refers to name-bound. The accusation made in the form of 'these are bound' in the context of carpentry, weaving, and plastering, etc., is called establishment-bound.

Substance-bound is of two types - substance-bound with knowledge and substance-bound without knowledge. Those who are aware of the bondage-producing substance but are devoid of its use in the present are called substance-bound with knowledge. Substance-bound without knowledge is of three types - knowledge-body substance-bound without knowledge, future substance-bound without knowledge, and other substance-bound without knowledge. The body of the one who knows the bondage-producing substance is called knowledge-body substance-bound without knowledge. The being who is going to become the knower of the bondage-producing substance in the future is called future substance-bound without knowledge. Other substance-bound without knowledge is of two types - karma-substance-bound and non-karma-substance-bound. Non-karma-substance-bound is also of three types - conscious non-karma-substance-bound, unconscious non-karma-substance-bound, and mixed non-karma-substance-bound. Among them, the bound of conscious beings like elephants, etc., are called conscious non-karma-substance-bound. The bound of inanimate objects like a broom and a mat, etc., are called unconscious non-karma-substance-bound. The bound of conscious beings like elephants, etc., combined with inanimate objects like ornaments, etc., should be understood as mixed non-karma-substance-bound. Karma-substance-bound is of two types - karma-substance-bound of the path of liberation and karma-substance-bound of the worldly cycle. Those who are non-passionate beings devoid of the state and the division of bondage, bound by karma in the form of nature and region only for the sake of liberation, are karma-substance-bound of the path of liberation, and those who are passionate beings bound by karma which is the cause of the worldly cycle are karma-substance-bound of the worldly cycle.

In the **Chakkhandagama**, the **Khudabandho**
[2, 1, 2
are said to be. The aforementioned **Iryapathakarmadravya Bandhak** are of two types - **Chhadmastha** and **Kevali**. Among these, **Chhadmastha** are also of two types - **Upshantakashaya** and **Ksheenakashaya**. **Samparayikakarmadravya Bandhak** are of two types - **Sukshmasamparayik** and **Badarsamparayik**.
**Bhaavabandhak** are of two types - **Aagamambhaavabandhak** and **Noaagamambhaavabandhak**. Among these, the beings who are aware of **Bandhpraabhrut** and are also involved in its use in the present are called **Aagamambhaavabandhak**. Those who assimilate **Kashaya** like **Krodha** etc. are called **Noaagamambhaavabandhak**. Among all these **Bandhak**, **Karmabandhak** are the main ones.
Now, since the fourteen **Marganaasthan** are the basis for the manifestation of these **Bandhak** through the fourteen **Sutras** ahead, therefore, the **Margana** are being instructed.
**Gati, Indriya, Kaya, Yoga, Veda, Kashaya, Gyan, Samyama, Darshan, Leshya, Bhavyatva, Samyaktva, Sanjee** and **Aahar**; these are the fourteen **Marganaasthan** || 2 || (See **Satpraaroopanasutra 4**) In **Gadiyanuvaad**, **Niraayagadee** are **Neraaya Bandha** || 3 ||
According to **Gati Margana**, **Naraki Jeeva** are **Bandhak** in **Narakagati** || 3 ||
**Joga, Veda, Kashaya, Gyan, Samyama, Darshan, Leshya, Bhavie, Sammat**
**Sutras** ' **Bandha** ' should be accepted by saying so. Because, in the doer and the doer, both the words ' **Bandha** ' and ' **Bandhak** ' are proven.
**Manusa Bandha** is also there, **Abandha** also
**Trikha Bandha** || 4 || **Deva Bandha** || 5 || **Asthi** || 6 ||
**Tich** are **Bandhak** || 4 || **Deva** are **Bandhak** || 5 || **Manushya** are also **Bandhak** and also **Abandhak** || 6 ||
**Mithyatva, Asanyama Kashaya** and **Yoga** are the causes of **Karmabandhak**. Since all of these are absent in **Ayogikeval Gunasthan**, therefore, **Ayogi Jin** are **Abandhak** in humans. The rest of the humans are **Bandhak**, because, they are found to be associated with those causes of **Mithyatva** etc. **Bandhak**.

**Siddha Abandhak** || 7 ||
**Siddha** are **Abandhak** || 7 ||
Because, they are free from the causes of **Bandhak** like **Mithyatva** etc. and are associated with their opposites - **Samyagdarshan, Samyama, Akashaya** and **Ayogaroopa Moksha** causes.
Out of the above four causes of **Bandhak**, the rise of **Mithyatva** is **Mithyatva Napumsakveda, Narakayu**,

Insufferable, dislike, sorrow, unstable, inauspicious and bad-fame; these six natures are the cause of negligence. Four sanjwalan and nine nok-kshayas' intense arising is called negligence. It should be understood as included in kshaya among the above four causes of bondage. Divine-life (till apramat-gunasthan), sleep, movement (till the first seventh part of apurvakaran), divine-realm, five-sensed beings, crooked, food-taker, luminous and karman-body, equal-square-sanstahn, crooked and food-taker body-limbs, color, smell, taste, touch, divine-realm-previous-experience, heavy-light, attack, counter-attack, exhalation, appropriate liberation-realm, fear, bad-luck, sufficient, every-body, stable, auspicious, prosperous, good-voice, worthy, creation, Tirthankara (till the sixth part of the seven parts of apurvakaran); laughter, liking, fear, disgust (till the last part of apurvakaran), four sanjwalan and male-knowledge (till anivrittikaran); these natures are the cause of bondage as much as possible due to the arising of kshaya.
Five jnanaavaran, chakshudarshanaavaran etc. four darshanaavaran, fame, high-caste and five antaray (till sukshmasampray gunasthan) these sixteen natures are the cause of bondage due to the general arising of kshaya. The cause of bondage of sataavedaniya is only yoga.

[348] In the six-fold division of the universe, beings with five senses are bound from the Mithyatva-drishti Gunasthan to the Sayogikevali Gunasthan; because, they possess the causes of bondage, such as Mithyatva, etc. But they are unbound by the Ayogikevali rule, because, they have lost all the causes of bondage, such as Mithyatva, etc. Therefore, it is said here that "beings with five senses are both bound and unbound."
Anidya Abandha || 10 || Beings without senses are unbound || 10 || Here, by "Anidriya," the Siddhas, who are devoid of body and senses, are meant.

Taskaiya Bandha Vi Aththi Abandha Vi Aththi || 12 || Beings with three bodies are also bound and unbound || 12 ||
The reason for this is that from the Mithyatva-drishti Gunasthan to the Sayogikevali Gunasthan, beings with three bodies possess the causes of bondage, such as Mithyatva, etc., but they are not found in the Ayogikevalis.
Akaiya Abandha || 13 || Siddha beings, who are devoid of body, are unbound || 13 ||

Beings who are Apangatavedis are also bound and unbound || 17 ||
From the Aved part of the Anivritikarana to the Sayogikevali, beings who are Apangatavedis are bound, because, they possess the causes of bondage, such as kshaya and yoga. But in the said Apangatavedis, the Ayogikevalis have no remaining cause of bondage, so they are unbound.

The intention is that due to the difference in **Naya** (Perspective), the meaning of the word **Nāraka** is different in respect to **Nīkshepa** (Deposit) and **Aupaśamika** (Temporary) states. Therefore, it is asked here which **Nāraka** is intended and how does it come about.
**Niravagadīnāmāe Udaeṇa** || 5 || A being becomes a **Nāraka** due to the **Udaya** (Arising) of the **Niravagadīnāmā** (Hell-realm name-karma). || 5 ||

[2, 1, 23] According to the *Samittaanugama*, how does a being become a *Siddha* through *Kshayik* attainment? [353]
[13] Through *Kshayik* attainment, a being becomes a *Siddha*. [13]
According to the *Indriyaanuvaada*, how does a being become *Ekeindriya*, *Dveindriya*, *Treeindriya*, *Chaturindriya*, and *Panchendriya*? [14]
[14] According to the *Indriyamaargnaa*, a being becomes *Ekeindriya*, *Dveindriya*, *Treeindriya*, *Chaturindriya*, and *Panchendriya* based on the *Indriyas*. [14]
Through *Kshayopaashama* attainment. [15] Through *Kshayopaashama* attainment, a being becomes *Ekeindriya* etc. [15]
The *Sutras* state that due to the complete cessation of the *Sarvaghaati* competitors related to the *Sparshan* *Indriyaavaran*, the emergence of the *Deshagaati* competitors related to the same, the emergence and cessation of the *Deshagaati* competitors related to the remaining four *Indriyaavaran*, the complete cessation of the *Sarvaghaati* competitors related to the same, and the emergence of the *Sarvaghaati* competitors related to the same, a being attains the state of *Ekeindriya*. Therefore, it is said that this state is attained through *Kshayopaashama* attainment. Similarly, one should understand the relationship with the remaining states of *Dveindriya* etc.
How does a being become *Anindriya*? [16] How does a being become *Anindriya*, i.e., devoid of *Indriyas* (*Bhaavendriya*)? [16]
Through *Kshayik* attainment. [17] Through *Kshayik* attainment, a being becomes *Anindriya*. [17]
One should understand that the *Sutras* imply that when the *Samoola Karma* is destroyed, the *Aatmaparinaama* that arises is called *Kshaya*, and its attainment is called *Kshayik* attainment. Through this *Kshayik* attainment, a being becomes *Anindriya*.
According to the *Kaayaanuvaada*, how does a being become *Prithvikaayik*? [18]
Through the emergence of the *Prithvikaayik* *Naamakarma*. [19] Through the emergence of the *Prithvikaayik* *Naamakarma*, a being becomes *Prithvikaayik*. [19]

[354] In the six-part scripture, how does one become a *Vāyukāyika*? [2,1,24] How does one become a *Vāyukāyika*? [24] By the arising of the *Vāyukāyika* name-nature. [25]
How does one become a *Vanaphai-kāyika*? [26] By the arising of the *Vanaphai-kāyika* name-nature. [27]
How does one become a *Trasakāyika*? [28] By the arising of the *Trasakāyika* name-nature. [29]
How does one become *Akāyika*? [30] By attaining *Kṣayika* liberation. [31]
According to the *Yoga* teachings, how does one become *Mano-yogi*, *Vacana-yogi*, and *Kāya-yogi*? [32] By attaining *Kṣayopaśamika* liberation. [33]
The pulsation of the *Jīva* regions, which is contraction and expansion, is called *Yoga*. This *Yoga* is of three types: *Mano-yoga*, *Vacana-yoga*, and *Kāya-yoga*. The contraction and expansion of the *Jīva* regions due to the dependence on the *Mana* substance, which arises from the *Mano-vargaṇa*, is called *Mano-yoga*. The contraction and expansion of the *Jīva* regions due to the dependence on the *Pudgala* skandhas related to the *Bhāṣā-vargaṇa* is called *Vacana-yoga*. The contraction and expansion of the *Jīva* regions due to the dependence on the four bodies, excluding the *Taijasa* body, such as the *Audārika* body, is called *Kāya-yoga*. The *Jīva* attains these three *Yogas* as much as possible through *Kṣayopaśama* liberation. Since these three *Yogas* arise from the destruction and pacification of the *Vīrya* obstacle and the *No-Indriya* covering, etc., as much as possible, they are said to be born from *Kṣayopaśamika* liberation.
How does one become *Ayogi*? [34] By attaining *Kṣayika* liberation. [35]
According to the *Veda* teachings, how does one become *Sthri-veda*, *Purisa-veda*, and *Napumsaka-veda*? [36] By the arising of the *Caritra-mohaniya* karma, one becomes *Sthri-veda*, *Purisa-veda*, and *Napumsaka-veda*. [37]
It is said.

According to the Samittaanugama, the knowledge path (Naanammaggana), the life path (Jeev Charitra), and the obscuring path (Mohaniya) are all categorized under the Nokshaya path. Within this, there are three types of Vedis: Strivedi (female), Purushavedi (male), and Napumsakavedi (neuter). These are determined by the type of Vedika that arises. This is the meaning of the sutra.
How does a being become Apangatavedi? || 38 || Through the attainment of the Upshamik and Kshayik paths. || 39 ||
When a being, having ascended the Upsham श्रेणी (Shreni) with the arising of the desired Vedika, has its obscuring path (Mohaniya) removed, the remaining Pudgalaskandha of the desired Vedika, devoid of any arising, is called Upsham. The attainment of this state leads to the Apangatavedi state for the being. Similarly, when a being, having ascended the Kshapak श्रेणी (Shreni) with the arising of the desired Vedika, has its obscuring path (Mohaniya) removed, the Pudgalaskandha of the desired Vedika, along with its state and division, completely separates from the being's regions. This is called Kshaya. The attainment of this state, resulting from the self-transformation, leads to the Apangatavedi state for the being.
According to the Kasayaanuvaad, how does a being become Krodhakashayi, Maanakashayi, Mayakashayi, and Lobhakashayi? || 40 || Through the arising of the Charitramohaniya karma. || 41 ||
The meaning is that a being becomes Krodhakashayi due to the arising of Krodhakashaya, Maanakashayi due to the arising of Maanakashaya, Mayakashayi due to the arising of Mayakashaya, and Lobhakashayi due to the arising of Lobhakashaya.
How does a being become Akashayi? || 42 || Through the attainment of the Upshamik and Kshayik paths. || 43 ||
According to the Naanammaggana, how does a being become Matyagnani, Shrutagnani, Vibhangagnani, Abhinibodhikagnani, Shrutagnani, Avadhignani, and Manaparyayagnani? || 44 ||
Through the attainment of the Kshayopahsamik path. || 45 ||
The meaning is that the attainment of the Kshayopahsamik path occurs due to the arising of the enemies of the being's own coverings (Matyagnanavaranaadi), and this leads to the being becoming Matyagnani, etc.

[356] In the Chakkhandagama, how does a being become a Kevala Jnani? [46] Through the attainment of Kshayika. [47] How does a being become a Samyata, Samayika, and Chhedopasthapana-Shuddha Samyata according to the Sanjamana Vada? [48] Through the attainment of Upshamika, Kshayika, and Kshayopa-shamika. [49] Since the state of Samyata is found in the Gunasthanas of Upshantaka-kshaya due to the complete cessation of the Charitra-mohaniya, and in the Gunasthanas of Kshina-kshaya due to its complete destruction, therefore, the origin of Samyata is described here as arising from Upshamika and Kshayika attainment. In addition, the origin of the said Samyata is also seen as arising from the emergence of four Sanjwalanas and nine Nok-kshayas, which are the enemies of the country, therefore, it is said to be born from Kshayopa-shamika attainment. The enemies of the country, being infinitely diminished, become transformed into the form of enemies of the country, and when they arise, their infinite diminution is called Kshaya, and their remaining in the form of enemies of the country is called Upsham. This Kshaya and Upsham, along with their state of being arisen, should be understood here as Kshayopa-sham. Through the attainment of this Kshayopa-sham, along with the state of Samyata, the state of Samayika-Samyata and Chhedopasthapana-Samyata also arises, therefore, their origin is also described in the Sutra as arising from Kshayopa-shamika attainment; this is the meaning of the Sutra. How does a being become a Parihara-Shuddha Samyata and Samyata-Samyata? [50] Through the attainment of Kshayopa-shamika. [51] How does a being become a Sukshma-Samparayika-Shuddha Samyata and Yatha-khyata-vihara-Shuddha Samyata? [52] Through the attainment of Upshamika and Kshayika. [53] Since both the Upshamika and Kshapaka types of Sukshma-Samparayika Gunasthanas have Sukshma-Samparayika-Shuddha Samyata, therefore, Sukshma-Samparayika-Shuddha Samyata is found in both Upshamika and Kshayika attainment.

It is said to be produced by *kṣayika labdhi*. As *yathakyātavihāra-śuddhi-saṁyama* is produced by *aupaśamika labdhi* in the eleventh *guṇasthāna* called *upaśāntakaṣāya*, and by *kṣayika labdhi* in the *guṇasthāna*s like *kṣīṇakaṣāya* onwards, so it is also designated as being produced by *aupaśamika* and *kṣayika labdhi*. • How does *asaṁjado* become? ||54|| By the arising of *karma* that destroys *saṁyama*. ||55||

Since *śuklaleśyā* arises from the arising of the *mandatma* etc. six types of *anubhāgasparadhaka*s of *kaṣāya*s, *padmaleśyā* from the arising of their *mandatara* *anubhāgasparadhaka*s, *tejo-leśyā* from the arising of *manda* *anubhāgasparadhaka*s, *kāpotaleśyā* from the arising of *tītra* *anubhāgasparadhaka*s, *nīlaleśyā* from the arising of *tīvratara* *anubhāgasparadhaka*s, and *kṛṣṇaleśyā* from the arising of *tīvratma* *anubhāgasparadhaka*s, therefore they are called *udayajanita* in the sūtra.

[358] In the Sixth Chapter of the Tattvartha Sutra, the author discusses the nature of the soul and its various states.

[2, 1, 65] The soul, through its inherent nature, experiences both auspicious and inauspicious states. [65]

How can the soul be said to be in an auspicious or inauspicious state? [66]

The soul is neither in an auspicious nor inauspicious state due to its inherent nature. [66]

How can the soul be said to be in a state of right faith (Samyag Darshan)? [68]

The soul attains right faith through the attainment of the three types of knowledge:  Aupaśamika (temporary), Kṣayika (permanent), and Kṣayopaśamika (temporary and permanent). [69]

Since right faith arises from the temporary cessation of the obscurations of the soul, the permanent cessation of the obscurations, and the temporary and permanent cessation of the obscurations, it is stated here that the soul attains right faith through the attainment of the three types of knowledge.

How can the soul be said to be in a state of Kṣayika Samyag Darshan (permanent right faith)? [70]

The soul attains Kṣayika Samyag Darshan through the attainment of Kṣayika knowledge. [71]

How can the soul be said to be in a state of Vedaka Samyag Darshan (right faith that leads to liberation)? [72]

The soul attains Vedaka Samyag Darshan through the attainment of Kṣayopaśamika knowledge. [73]

How can the soul be said to be in a state of Upaśama Samyag Darshan (temporary right faith)? [74]

The soul attains Upaśama Samyag Darshan through the attainment of Aupaśamika knowledge. [75]

How can the soul be said to be in a state of Sāsadan Samyag Darshan (right faith that leads to the destruction of the karmic body)? [76]

The soul attains Sāsadan Samyag Darshan through its inherent nature. [77]

How can the soul be said to be in a state of Samyag Mithyā Darshan (right faith that leads to the destruction of the karmic body)? [78]

The soul attains Samyag Mithyā Darshan through the attainment of Kṣayopaśamika knowledge. [79]

How can the soul be said to be in a state of Mithyā Darshan (wrong faith)? [80]

The soul attains Mithyā Darshan through the arising of wrong karma. [81]

[2, 1, 91] According to the Samittaanugama, how does a being become an Aahara?
[359] How does a being become a Mithyaadristi? ||80|| A being becomes a Mithyaadristi due to the arising of Mithyatva karma.
How does a being become a Sanni? ||82|| According to the Sanniyaanuvaada, a being becomes a Sanni due to the attainment of Kshayopaashamika.
According to the Sanjnimaargnaa, how does a being become a Sanjii? ||82|| A being becomes a Sanjii due to the attainment of Kshayopaashamika. ||83||
How does a being become an Asanni? ||84|| A being becomes an Asanni due to the Oudaayika Bhaava. ||85||
How does a being become neither Sanni nor Asanni? ||86|| A being becomes neither Sanni nor Asanni due to the attainment of Kshaayika. ||87||
The result of the destruction of the Jnaanavaaran is called Kshaayika. Due to this, a being becomes neither Sanjii nor Asanni.
According to the Aaharaanuvaada, how does a being become an Aahara? ||88|| A being becomes an Aahara due to the Oudaayika Bhaava. ||89||
It should be understood that a being becomes an Aahara due to the arising of the three karmas called Oudaarika, Vaikriya, and Aahara.
How does a being become an Anaahara? ||90|| A being becomes an Anaahara due to the Oudaayika Bhaava and the attainment of Kshaayika. ||91||
The meaning is that the Anaahara state of the Ayogikevali and Siddhas is due to the attainment of Kshaayika, because their respective Ghaatiya karmas and all karmas have been destroyed. However, the Anaahara state in the Vigraha Gati is due to the Oudaayika Bhaava, because all karmas arise in the Vigraha Gati.

[362] In the **Chakkhandagama**, the duration of **Khuddabhava** is described:

[2, 2, 20] The duration of **Khuddabhava** for a **Jiva** who is a **Manushya** (human), **Manushya Paryapta** (sufficient human), and **Manushya Ni** (female human) is at least **Kshudrabhava** and at most **Antarmuhurta**. [20]

The minimum duration for ordinary humans is **Kshudrabhava**, as they have the potential to be **Manushya Aparyapta** (insufficient human). However, the minimum duration for **Manushya Paryapta** and **Manushya Ni** is **Antarmuhurta**, as they cannot have a shorter lifespan.

[21] The maximum duration for a **Jiva** who is a **Manushya**, **Manushya Paryapta**, and **Manushya Ni** is three **Palyopam** (a unit of time), exceeding **Purvakotipruthaktva** (a specific number of births). [21]

Here, **Purvakotipruthaktva** refers to 47, 23, and 7 **Purvakotis** respectively.

[22] How long does a **Jiva** who is a **Manushya Aparyapta** (insufficient human) live? [22]

[23] A **Jiva** who is a **Manushya Aparyapta** lives at least for the duration of **Kshudrabhava**. [23]

[24] The maximum duration for a **Manushya Aparyapta** is **Antarmuhurta**. [24]

[25] How long do **Devas** (gods) in the **Devagati** (heavenly realm) live? [25]

[26] The minimum duration for a **Jiva** who is a **Deva** in the **Devagati** is ten thousand years. [26]

[27] The maximum duration for a **Jiva** who is a **Deva** in the **Devagati** is thirty-three **Sagaropama** (a unit of time). [27]

[28] How long do **Bhavana Vasi**, **Chanavantar**, and **Jyotishi Devas** (types of gods) live? [28]

[29] The minimum duration for a **Jiva** who is a **Bhavana Vasi**, **Chanavantar**, and **Jyotishi Deva** is ten thousand years, ten thousand years, and one-eighth of a **Palyopam** respectively. [29]

One becomes a manoyogi and with that manoyoga, staying for only one moment, in the second moment, one attains death and again becomes a kayayogi. In this way, the minimum time of manoyoga is one moment. Or, the same kayayogi jiva, after the end of the kayayoga time, becomes a manoyogi and then, in the second moment, attains destruction and again becomes a kayayogi. In this way, the minimum time of manoyoga is one moment in another way as well. In the same way, one should understand the minimum time of the remaining four manoyogas and five vachanayogas.

[370] In the **Chakkhandagama**, it is stated that the **Khuddabandho** (minimum duration) of the **Samaya** (time) for a **Jiva** (soul) who attains **Vaikriyika-kaya-yoga** (body-yoga) through **Mano-yoga** (mind-yoga) or **Vachan-yoga** (speech-yoga) and dies in the second **Samaya** is **Jghan-ya-kala** (minimum time). This is because, in the first **Samaya** of death, **Vaikriyika-kaya-yoga** is not attained except for **Karman-kaya-yoga**, **Audarika-mishra-kaya-yoga**, and **Vaikriyika-mishra-kaya-yoga**. The **Sutrot-ka-kala** (time mentioned in the scriptures) for **Aharaka-kaya-yoga** is attained by a **Pramatta-samyata-jiva** (a soul who is partially restrained) who attains **Aharaka-kaya-yoga** through **Mano-yoga** or **Vachan-yoga** and dies in the second **Samaya** or enters the **Mula-sharira** (original body). This is because **Aharaka-kaya-yoga** is not attained in the first **Samaya** of death or in the first **Samaya** of entering the **Mula-sharira**.

**Ukkassena Anto-muhutta** [107] - The maximum duration for **Audarika-mishra-kaya-yoga** etc. is **Anto-muhutta** (a very short time).

**Veubbi-amiss-kaya-jogi Ahar-amiss-kaya-jagi Keva-chiran-kala-do Hodi** [1] - How long does a **Jiva** remain in **Vaikriyika-mishra-kaya-yoga** and **Aharaka-mishra-kaya-yoga**?

**Jahannena Anto-muhutta** [109] - The minimum duration for a **Jiva** in **Vaikriyika-mishra-kaya-yoga** and **Aharaka-mishra-kaya-yoga** is **Anto-muhutta**.

**Ukkassena Anto-muhutta** [110] - The maximum duration for a **Jiva** in **Vaikriyika-mishra-kaya-yoga** and **Aharaka-mishra-kaya-yoga** is **Anto-muhutta**.

**Kamma-iya-kaya-jogi Keva-chiran-kala-do Hodi** [111] - How long does a **Jiva** remain in **Karman-kaya-yoga**?

**Jahannena Ega-samao** [112] - The minimum duration for a **Jiva** in **Karman-kaya-yoga** is one **Samaya**.

**Ukkassena Tinna-samaya** [113] - The maximum duration for a **Jiva** in **Karman-kaya-yoga** is three **Samaya**.

**Vedanu-va-dena Itthi-veda Keva-chiran-kala-do Honti** [114] - According to the **Veda** (scripture), how long does a **Jiva** remain as a **Stri-vedi** (female)?

**Jahannana Ega-samao** [115] - The minimum duration for a **Jiva** as a **Stri-vedi** is one **Samaya**.

A **Jiva** who was an **Apagata-vedi** (a **Jiva** who has lost their **Veda** (scripture)) and descended from the **Upshama-shreni** (category of **Jiva**s) to become a **Stri-vedi** and died in the second **Samaya** as a **Purusha-vedi** (male), the minimum duration for a **Stri-vedi** is only one **Samaya**.

**Ukkassena Palyo-upam-shat-pruthak-ta** [116] - The maximum duration for a **Jiva** as a **Stri-vedi** is **Palyo-upam-shat-pruthak-ta** (a very long time).

**Purisa-veda Keva-chiran-kala-do Honti** [117] - How long does a **Jiva** remain as a **Purusha-vedi**?

[2, 2, 126]  How long do *Purushavedi* souls remain in that state?  || 117 || At least one *Antarmuhurta* || 118 ||  *Purushavedi* souls remain in that state for at least one *Antarmuhurta*. || 118 ||

A soul ascends the *Upshama* series and becomes an *Apagatavedi*.  Then, descending from there, it becomes a *Purushavedi* with *Ved* and remains in that state for the shortest possible time, one *Antarmuhurta*.  Then, it ascends the *Upshama* series again and becomes an *Apagatavedi*.  Thus, the shortest possible time for a *Purushavedi* is only one *Antarmuhurta*.

At most, they remain *Purushavedi* for a time equal to a hundred *Pruthaktva* like the ocean. || 119 ||

How long do *Napumsakavedi* souls remain in that state? || 120 ||  *Napumsakavedi* souls remain in that state for at least one *Samaya*. || 121 ||

This shortest possible time for a *Napumsakavedi* is found when a soul descends from the *Upshama* series.  At most, they remain *Napumsakavedi* for an infinite time, equal to an innumerable number of *Pudgala* transformations. || 122 ||

How long do *Apagatavedi* souls remain in that state? || 123 ||  *Apagatavedi* souls remain in that state for at least one *Samaya*, compared to the *Upshama*. || 124 ||

A soul ascends the *Upshama* series and becomes an *Apagatavedi*.  It remains an *Apagatavedi* for only one *Samaya* and then dies and becomes *Saveda* in the second *Samaya*.  Thus, the shortest possible time for an *Apagatavedi* is only one *Samaya*.

At most, they remain *Apagatavedi* for one *Antarmuhurta*. || 125 ||  Compared to the *Kshapaka*, *Apagatavedi* souls remain in that state for at least one *Antarmuhurta*. || 126 ||

Chhakkanḍāgame Khuddābandho
[2, 2, 127
This is found in the case of a being who has become liberated in the most inferior time, having ascended the क्षपक श्रेणी and become अपगतवेदी.
Ukkassena Putrakoḍī Deṇam ||| 127 |||
Beings who are अपगतवेदी remain for a time that is slightly less than one पूर्वकोटि काल at the most. || 127 ||
A deva or a narakī who has become क्षायिकसम्यग्दृष्टि is born among humans with a lifespan of one पूर्वकोटि काल and becomes a संयमी after eight years. Then, he becomes a केवलज्ञानी, having ascended the क्षपक श्रेणी from the most inferior time and become अपगतवेदी, and attains liberation after dwelling for a time that is slightly less than one पूर्वकोटि काल. Thus, the superior time of an अपगतवेदी, compared to a क्षपक, is found to be only slightly less than one पूर्वकोटि काल.

According to the doctrine of कषाय, how long do beings remain क्रोधकषायी, मानकषायी, मायाकषायी, and लोभकषायी? || 128 ||
Jahaṇ Eyasamo || 129 ||
Beings remain क्रोधकषायी, etc., for at least one समय. || 129 || A being, due to an unintentional कषाय, becomes क्रोधकषायी and then dies in the second समय, leaving the नरकगति and being reborn elsewhere. Thus, the most inferior time of क्रोध कषाय is only one समय, which is not the cause of being born in the नरकगति, because the arising of क्रोध कषाय is seen in the first समय of the birth of beings born there. In the same way, the most inferior time of मान, माया, and लोभ कषाय should also be understood as only one समय. The difference is that the most inferior time of मान should be understood as causing rebirth in the other three gatis, excluding the मनुष्यगति, the most inferior time of माया should be understood as causing rebirth in the other three gatis, excluding the तिर्यंचगति, and the most inferior time of लोभ should be understood as causing rebirth in the other three gatis, excluding the देवगति. The reason for this is that the arising of मान, माया, and लोभ, respectively, is seen in the first समय of the birth of beings born in those gatis. Just as their most inferior time is only one समय compared to death, in the same way, their most inferior time is only one समय compared to व्याघात, except for क्रोध कषाय. The most inferior time of क्रोध कषाय is not possible compared to व्याघात, because the arising of क्रोध itself occurs when व्याघात happens.

Ukkassena Antomuhutan || 130 ||

According to the knowledge path, how long does a being remain a non-knower and a knower of scriptures? || 132 ||
The time-form of non-knower beings is like that of the apostate-knowers. || 131 ||
The time of non-knower and knower of scriptures beings is beginningless-endless. || 133 ||
The above mentioned time of both the non-knowers is beginningless-endless in comparison to the non-liberated and liberated beings.
The time of both the non-knowers is beginningless-finite in comparison to the liberated being. || 134 ||
The time of both the non-knowers is finite-finite. || 135 ||
In comparison to the liberated being who has attained non-knowledge from right knowledge, the time of both the non-knowers is also found to be finite-finite.
The description of that finite-finite time is as follows: that finite-finite time is only a fraction of a moment. || 136 ||
The reason for this is that a liberated being who has attained non-knowledge from right knowledge remains a non-knower and a knower of scriptures for at least a fraction of a moment.
The being remains a non-knower and a knower of scriptures for a maximum of slightly less than half a pudgala-parivartan time. || 137 ||
How long does a being remain a knower of divisions? || 138 ||
A being remains a knower of divisions for at least one time. || 139 ||
He remains a knower of divisions for a maximum of slightly less than thirty-three ocean-like times. || 140 ||

The reason for this is that if a Kevaldarshani Jiva were to enter the realm of Achakṣudarshani Jivas, it would lead to the creation of a beginning for Achakṣudarshani, which is entirely impossible.

[2, 5, 20]  The number of hell beings in each of the seven earths, starting from the second earth, is an immeasurable fraction of the total number of hell beings. [11]
The size of each hell realm is immeasurable yojanakotis. [12]
The measure of the immeasurable yojanakotis is the product of the square roots of the number of hell realms, starting from the first. [13]
This means that the number of hell beings in the second earth is the product of the square roots of the number of hell realms, starting from the first and going down to the twelfth. The number of hell beings in the third earth is the product of the square roots of the number of hell realms, starting from the first and going down to the tenth. The same principle applies to the remaining earths.

**Sanayata**, **Aparamatta-Sanayata**, **Apuurva-Karana-Pravisht** **Upshamak** and **Kshapak**, **Anivriti-Badar-Samparayik-Pravisht** **Upshamak** and **Kshapak**, **Sookshma-Samparayik-Pravisht** **Upshamak** and **Kshapak**, **Upshantak-Kshaya-Vitrag-Chhadmasth**, **Ksheen-Kshaya-Vitrag-Chhadmasth**, **Sayogik-Kevali** and **Ayogik-Kevali**; these are the fourteen **Jiva-Samas** (categories of souls). || 3 ||

Remembering the nature of these fourteen **Jiva-Samas**, the following Sutra explains the nature of **Prakriti-Bandha-Swamitva** (ownership of karmic bondage).

**Edesi-Choddasah-Jiva-Samasanam Payadi-Bandha-Vichchedo Kadavvo Bhavadi** || 4 ||

The **Prakriti-Bandha-Vichcheda** (destruction of karmic bondage) related to these fourteen **Jiva-Samas** is explained. || 4 ||

It should be understood that the **Bandhak** (owner of karmic bondage) of a **Prakriti** (karmic matter) is only up to the **Gunasthan** (stage of spiritual development) where its **Bandha-Vichcheda** (destruction of bondage) occurs. It does not have bondage in the **Gunasthan** beyond that.

Therefore, the destruction of **Karma-Prakritis** (karmic matter) is explained here based on these fourteen **Gunasthanas**.

**Panch Nana-Avaraniyaanam Chaduhnham Darshana-Avaraniyaanam Jasakitti Uchcha-Agoda-Panchanham Antara-Iyaanam Ko Bandho Ko Abandho?** || 5 ||

Which of these sixteen **Prakritis** - five **Jnana-Avaraniya** (knowledge obscurations), four **Darshana-Avaraniya** (perception obscurations), **Yasha** (fame), **Kirti** (reputation), **Uchcha-Gothra** (high lineage), and five **Antarayas** (hindrances) - are **Bandhak** (owned) and which are **Abandhak** (not owned)? || 5 ||

The word "**Bandha**" here refers to the **Bandhak** (owner of karmic bondage).

**Michcha-Ditthi Pahudi Javo Suhum-Samparaiy-Sudhi-Sanjadesu Uvasama Khava Bandha. Suhum-Samparaiy-Sudhi-Sanjad Ddhaae Charim-Samayam Gantun Bandho Vochchijjadi. Ede Bandha, Avsesa Abandho.** || 6 ||

From **Michcha-Ditthi** (wrong belief) up to **Sookshma-Samparayik-Sudhi-Sanjayata** (subtle, universal, pure, restrained, and pacified), the above-mentioned **Jivas** are **Bandhak** (owners) of the sixteen **Prakritis** like **Jnana-Avaraniya** etc. Their **Bandha** (bondage) is destroyed at the final moment of **Sookshma-Samparayik-Sudhi-Sanjayata**. These are **Bandhak** (owned), the rest are **Abandhak** (not owned). || 6 ||

**Nihaani-Dda - Payala-Payala-Theen Giddi - Ananta-Anubandhikoha - Maan - Maya - Lobh - Itthi-Vedatirikkha-U - Tirikkha-Gai - Chausthaan - Chausanghadana Tirikkha-Gai-Paoggana-Upuvi-Ujjavo - Appasath-Vihayagai Dubhag - Dusar - Anadejj - Neecha-Godaanam Ko Bandho Ko Abandho?** || 7 ||

Which of these twenty-five **Prakritis** - **Nidra-Nidra** (sleep-wakefulness), **Prachala-Prachala** (restlessness-stillness), **Sthyan-Giddhi** (laziness-greed), **Ananta-Anubandhi-Krodha** (infinitely connected anger), **Maan** (pride), **Maya** (deceit), **Lobh** (greed), **Stri-Ved** (attachment to women), **Tirikkha-Ayu** (animal life), **Tirikkha-Gati** (animal path), **Nyagrodha-Parimandala-Sansthan** etc. four **Sansthanas** (abodes), **Vajra-Naraacha-Sanhanan** etc. four **Sanhananas** (combinations), **Tirikkha-Gati-Prayoggana-Upuvi-Ujjavo** (previous practice of animal path), **Appasath-Vihayagai** (unsuitable liberation path), **Dubhag** (misfortune), **Duswar** (bad voice), **Anadejj** (unworthy), and **Neecha-Gothra** (low lineage) - are **Bandhak** (owned) and which are **Abandhak** (not owned)? || 7 ||

**Michcha-Ditthi Sasana-Samm-Aitthi Bandha. Ede Bandha, Avsesa Abandho.** || 8 ||

**Michcha-Ditthi** (wrong belief) and **Sasana-Samm-Aitthi** (wrong belief in scriptures) are **Bandhak** (owned). These are **Bandhak** (owned), the rest are **Abandhak** (not owned). || 8 ||

[3, 30].  Bound by the flow of the samitt-paroovana
[469] From Mithyaadristi to the Anivrittikaran-badar-sampraayik-pravist-upasama and kshapaka, all are bound.  The bond is broken when the Anivritti-badar-kaal reaches its end.  These are bound, the rest are unbound.  || 24 ||
The meaning is that when the bond of the Sanjwalan-krodha is broken, the remaining time of the Anivrittikaran-kaal is only a fraction of the total time.  When a large portion of this remaining time passes, only a small portion remains, and the bond of the Sanjwalan-mana is broken.  After that, when a large portion of the remaining time passes, the bond of the Sanjwalan-maya is broken.
Which are bound and which are unbound by the Sanjwalan-lobha?  || 25 ||
From Mithyaadristi to the Anivrittikaran-badar-sampraayik-pravist-upasama and kshapaka, all are bound.  The bond is broken when the Anivritti-badar-kaal reaches its end.  These are bound, the rest are unbound.  || 26 ||
Which are bound and which are unbound by the nature of Hassa, Radi, Bhaya, and Dugunchana?  || 27 ||

[470] In the **Chakkhandaga** (Six-Part) **Gama** (Scripture), the **Bandha-Samitt-Vicho** (Bond-Related Questions) are as follows:

[3, 31] **Mithyadristi** (False Belief), **Sasaadan-Samyagdristi** (Partial Right Belief), and **Asanyata-Samyagdristi** (Uncontrolled Right Belief) are **Bandhak** (Bonding). These are **Bandhak**, the rest are **Abandhak** (Non-Bonding). || 30 ||

Now here, to explain the reasons for the Tirthankara nature, the next Sutra says: Kadihi Karanehi Jivaa Titthayaranam-Godam Kammam Bandhati? ||39||  For how many reasons do the Jivas bind the Tirthankara name-gotra karma? ||39||
Since the Tirthankara nature is found inseparable with the high gotra, it is also called 'gotra' here.
Taththa Imehi Solasehi Karanehi Jivaa Titthayaranam-Godam Kammam Bandhanti ||40||  Jivas bind the Tirthankara name-gotra karma there (in the human realm) due to these sixteen reasons. ||40||

1. Darshan here refers to Samyag-Darshan. Three Mooḍhata, eight Shanka-adi doshas, six Anayatana and eight Mad; free from these twenty-five doshas, pure Samyag-Darshan is called Darshan-Vishuddhata.
2. Vinay is of three types - Gyan-Vinay, Darshan-Vinay and Chaaritra-Vinay. Being repeatedly useful in the subject of knowledge and being a devotee of Shruta and the knowledgeable Upadhyaya-adi, is called Gyan-Vinay. Knowing the Jiva-adi tattvas as explained by the Sarvagya, free from all doshas like Mooḍhata-adi, is called Darshan-Vinay.

---------------------------
[472] In the **Chakkhandagama**, the **Bandha-Samitt-Vicho** (questions about bondage and its components) are discussed.

[3, 41] To have pure faith without the three impurities (**raag**, **dvesha**, **moha**) is called **Darshan-Vinaya** (discipline of faith). To observe the vows of conduct (**sheel-vrata**) without any fault and without causing harm to the essentials (**avashyakas**) is called **Charitra-Vinaya** (discipline of conduct). The perfection of these three types of discipline is called **Vinaya-Sampannata** (perfection of discipline).

[3] The abandonment of the five sins (**himsa**, **asaty**, **chori**, **abrahma**, **parigraha**) is called **vrata** (vow), and the protection of these vows is called **sheel** (conduct). To indulge in drinking, eating meat, and not abandoning the **kashyaas** (passions) is called **atichaar** (excess). To observe the vows of conduct without these excesses is called **Sheel-Vrateshv-Anatichaarata** (absence of excess in vows of conduct).

[4] **Samata** (equanimity), **stav** (praise), **vandana** (salutation), **pratikraman** (confession), **pratyakhyan** (rejection), and **vyutsarg** (renunciation) are the six essentials. The abandonment of attachment and aversion towards desirable and undesirable objects, such as friends and enemies, is called **samata**. To offer salutations without discrimination between the five supreme beings (**arhanta**, **jina**, **siddha**, **chakravarti**, **balideva**) of the past, present, and future, by uttering phrases like "**Namo Arihantaanam Namo Jinaanam**" is called **stav**. To offer salutations with the utterance of words, remembering the qualities of the Tirthankaras like Rishabha, the Kevalis like Bharata, the Acharyas, and the Chaityalayas, separately, is called **vandana**. To remove the impurities arising from the great vows (**mahavrata**) with eighty-four lakh qualities is called **pratikraman**. To accept the purity of the eighty-four lakh vows by mentally reviewing them, with the intention of not allowing the destruction or contamination of the great vows, is called **pratyakhyan**. To withdraw the tendencies of the mind and speech from the body and food, and to focus the mind on the desired object with concentration, is called **vyutsarg**. The perfection of these six essentials is called **Avashyakaparhiheenata** (absence of deficiency in essentials).

[5] To constantly keep the mind pure by removing the impurities related to **samyag darshan** (right faith), **samyag gyan** (right knowledge), and **vrata-sheel** (vows and conduct) is called **Kshan-Lav-Pratibodhanata** (moment-by-moment awakening).

[6] The attainment of **samyag darshan**, **samyag gyan**, and **samyag charitra** (right conduct) is called **labdhi** (attainment), and the joy arising from it is called **sanveag** (emotion). The perfection of this attainment is called **Labdhi-Sampannata** (perfection of attainment).

[7] **Thaam** means strength and power. Therefore, to practice both external and internal austerities according to one's strength and power is called **Yatha-Thaam-Tatha-Tap** (austerity according to one's strength).

[8] The great souls who are dedicated to the practice of **ananta gyan** (infinite knowledge), **darshan** (faith), etc., are called **sadhu** (saint). To give up (donate) the **ratnatraya** (three jewels) to the **sadhus** who have attained **samyag darshan**, etc., and whose **asrava** (influx) has been destroyed, is called **Sadhu-Prasuk-Parityaagata** (renunciation for the sake of saints). This means that to give the **ratnatraya** to the **sadhus** out of compassion is called **Sadhu-Prasuk-Parityaag**. This is possible only for the **maharishis** (great sages), not for the householders.

[473] Bandha-Samitt-Paroopan by Ogh
[3, 42] 9. The state of being in Samyag Darshan, Samyag Gyan and Samyak Charitra is called Samadhi. To hold it appropriately or to make it perfect is the Samadhi Sandharanta of the Sadhus.
10. The care, etc., that is done for a Sadhu who is in distress is called Vyavritta. The Jiva who is united with Samyag Darshan, Samyag Gyan, Arhat Bhakti and Pravachan Vatsalata, etc., and is engaged in Vyavritta, is called the Vyavritta Yogyukta of the Sadhus.
11. Those who have destroyed the Ghatichatuṣṭaya or all eight Karmas and have become the knower and seer of all things (the whole and the separate Supreme Soul) are called Arhant. To have faith in them - to be engaged in the practices taught by them, is called Arhat Bhakti.
12. Those who have transcended the twelve Angas are called Bahushruta. To have faith in them - to contemplate the meaning of the Agamas spoken by them, is called Bahushruta Bhakti.
13. The meaning of 'Pra' is excellent or superior (Sarvagya), the word (speech) of that excellent, i.e., Sarvagya, is called Pravachan. According to this etymology, the Siddhant or the twelve Angas should be understood as Pravachan. To have faith in this Pravachan - to practice the actions embodied in it, is called Pravachan Bhakti.
14. The Deshavratis, Mahavrati and Asanyat Samyagdrishti Jivas who are in the Pravachan in the form of the twelve Angas are also called Pravachan. The name of having affection for them is Pravachan Vatsalata.
15. The name of the meaning of the Agamas is Pravachan. To expand or increase its fame is called Pravachan Prabhavanta.
16. The meaning of Abhikṣṇa-Abhikṣṇa is 'again and again' and the meaning of Gyanopयोग is Bhavaśruta and Dravyashruta. To be constantly engaged in both these types of Shruta is to be understood as Abhikṣṇa-Abhikṣṇa Gyanopयोगyukta.
These sixteen reasons cause the Bandha of the Tirthankara nature. From the perspective of Dravyarthik Nay, even in each individual reason, since there is inclusion of all other reasons, therefore, Bandha of the said Tirthankara nature is considered from each individual reason. Or, it should be understood that when Samyag Darshan occurs, then the combination of one, two, etc., other reasons in the remaining fifteen reasons causes the Bandha of that Tirthankara nature.
Those who are the Tirthankaras, the source of the good Karma, are worthy of being honored, worshipped, saluted and bowed to by the Devas, Asuras and humans of the world. They are the Jinas, the Kevalis, the Dharma-Tirthankaras. || 42 ||

In the **Chakkhandaga** (Six-Part) **Gama** (Text), the **Bandha-Samitt-Vicho** (Bondage-Related Questions) section:

[3, 43]
Those Jivas (living beings) who attain the **Tīrthankara** (Liberated Soul) name and lineage are, from the time of their attainment, worthy of being worshipped, honored, revered, and saluted by the Devas (gods), Asuras (demons), and humans. They are the leaders, the creators of the **Dharma-Tīrtha** (Path of Righteousness), and the **Jina** (Conqueror) and **Kevali** (Omniscient). || 42 ||
[474]
To illuminate one's devotion through water, sandalwood, flowers, offerings, and fruits, etc., is called **Archa** (Worship). The performance of special rituals like **Indradhvaja** (Flag of Indra), **Kalpavriksha** (Wish-Fulfilling Tree), and **Mahamaha** (Great Great) with the aforementioned substances is called **Puja** (Offering). O Bhagavan (Lord)! You are free from the eight **Karmas** (Actions) and know all the animate and inanimate beings through **Kevalajnana** (Omniscience). This kind of praise is called **Vandana** (Salutation). To fall at the feet of the **Jinendra** (Victorious) with the five **Angas** (Limbs) is called **Namaskara** (Prostration). Since the ocean of **Samsara** (Cycle of Birth and Death) is crossed by the **Ratnatraya** (Three Jewels) - **Dharma** (Righteousness), **Jnana** (Knowledge), and **Charitra** (Conduct) - it is called **Tīrtha** (Ford).

[3, 222] Jnanamarganaya bandha-samittam
[497] From the asanyata-samyagdrsti to the kshinakasaya-vitaraga-chadmastha, they are bandhakas (bondages). They are bandhakas, not abandhakas. || 214 ||

Sesamopaṃ jāva titthaṃkare ti. Navari asaṃjadasammādihippahuḍi tti bhāṇidavvaṃ || 
The exposition of the remaining prakritis up to the Tirthankaras is like the ogha (stream). The only difference is that in the exposition of their bandhakas, it should be said "from the asanyata-samyagdrsti and so on". || 215 ||

The reason for this is that here the topic is of the three jnanas - abhinibodhika etc., which are not found in the gunasthananas lower than the asanyata-samyagdrsti gunasthana.

From the pramatta-samyata onwards up to the sukshmaSamparaya-upaśama and kṣapaka, they are bandhakas. At the last moment of the sukshmaSamparaya-samyata period, the bandha is severed. These are the bandhakas, the rest are abandhakas.

[498] In the Chakkhandagama, a question about bondage and its components.
[3, 223... The pattern of bondage for the Tirthankara nature is similar to the pattern of bondage for the remaining natures. The only difference is that in their pattern, one should say "from the distracted restrained" onwards. || 222 ||...
The reason for this is that the nature of mind-perception knowledge is not possible below the distracted restrained state.
In the Kevalanāṇīs, who is bound and who is unbound? || 223 ||
The Sayogikevali is bound. The Sayogikevali, at the end of his time, becomes unbound. These are bound, the rest are unbound. || 224 ||

The only difference is, who is bound and who is unbound in the case of the Sātavedanīya? || 226 ||
From the distracted restrained to the Sayogikevali, all are bound. The Sayogikevali, at the end of his time, becomes unbound. These are bound, the rest are unbound. || 227 ||

From the distracted restrained to the non-restraining cessation, pacifier, and destroyer, all are bound. These are bound, there are no unbound. || 229 ||
The pattern of the remaining natures is the same as that of the mind-perception knowledge. || 230 ||

**The creation and suffering, etc., twenty-four Anuyoga-doors, their nature, Maha-karma-prakriti, etc., at the beginning, the auspiciousness done by Sri Gautama Ganadhara, from there, Bhagavan Bhutbali Bhattaraka, establishing here at the beginning of the suffering Maha-adhikarya, first of all, salutes the Jinas.**

**Namo Jinananam ||1|| Salutations to the Jinas ||1||**

Jinas are of four types, based on name, establishment, substance, and emotion. Among them, the word 'Jina' is the name-Jina. Establishment Jinas are of two types, based on good establishment and bad establishment. The substance that is established in the form of the Jina Bhagavan is the good establishment Jina. The substance in which the Jina Bhagavan is imagined, without that form, is the bad establishment Jina.

Substance Jinas are of two types, based on Agam and No-Agam. The being who is the knower of the Jina-prabhruta, but is devoid of use in the present, is called the Agam-dravya-Jina. No-Agam-dravya-Jinas are of three types, based on the knowing body, future, and other than that. Among them, the knowing body No-Agam-dravya-Jina is of three types, based on future, present, and understood. The future substance that is going to be transformed by the Jina-paryaya in the future is called the future substance Jina. The other than that substance Jina is of three types, based on sentient, non-sentient, and both. Among them, the conqueror of camels, horses, and elephants, etc., is called the sentient substance Jina, and the conqueror of gold, silver, gems, and pearls, etc., is called the non-sentient substance Jina. The conquerors of girls, etc., along with ornaments made of gold, etc., should be known as sentient-non-sentient substance Jinas.

**Agam and No-Agam, based on these two, emotion Jinas are of two types. Among them, the being who is the knower of the Jina-prabhruta, and is connected with use in the present, is the Agam-bhava-Jina. No-Agam-bhava-Jinas are of two types, based on appropriate and transformed. Among them, the one who is transformed by the knowledge that receives the Jina-swarupa is...**

Mangalāyaraṇam through Diāṇayoga
[511
One should know the Tatparinātabhāvajin and the Jina-paryāya of the Jīva who has been transformed by the appropriate Bhāvajin. In all these Jina-bhedas, Tatparinātabhāvajin and Sthāpanājin have been saluted here.
Since the qualities of Tatparinātabhāvajin are attributed to Sthāpanājin, it is also auspicious to salute them. The meaning of Mangala is the purification of sin-dirt. Just as it happens by saluting Tatparinātabhāvajin according to the pure results, in the same way, it is possible by saluting the Jina-pratimās in which the qualities of Tatparinātabhāvajin have been attributed by the support of Sthāpanānikshepa. Jinas are truly Vītarāga, therefore they themselves do not destroy anyone's sin-dirt, but by their support, the destruction of the devotee's sin happens automatically according to his results.
Here, the word 'Jina' should be understood as encompassing all five Paramēshṭhis, because there are two types of Jinas, Sakalajina and Deshajina. Those who have destroyed the Ghatiyā karmas are called Arhant and Siddha, they are Sakalajina. Along with this, Āchārya, Upādhyāya and Sādhu are also considered Deshajina because they have conquered the intense Kashaya, Indriya and Moha.
Namo Ahijīnāṇam || 2 || Salutations to the Avadhijin || 2 ||
The word 'Avadhi' here refers to Avadhījñānīs, with the intention of non-duality between the quality and the qualified. Salutations to those Maharshis who are the holders of Deshāvadhi, along with the three jewels of Samyagdarshan, Samyagjñāna and Samyakchāritra, this is the meaning of the sūtra.
Namo Para Mohijīnāṇam || 3 || Salutations to the Paramāvadhijin || 3 ||
1
Avadhījñāna is of three types: Deshāvadhi, Paramāvadhi and Sarvāvadhi. In these, the Jinas who are holders of Deshāvadhi have been saluted in the previous sūtra, and now through this sūtra, the Jinas who are holders of Paramāvadhi are being saluted. The meaning of the word 'Parama' is superior or excellent. Accordingly, the Maharshis who are holders of superior Avadhījñāna compared to Deshāvadhi are being saluted through this sūtra.
This Paramāvadhijñāna, being greater in scope than Deshāvadhi, arises only in those humans who are restrained and have Man:paryaya-jñāna, it is the cause of the birth of Kevalajñāna in the very birth in which it arises, and it is not Pratipāti, meaning it does not fall from Samyaktva and Chāritra and attain Mithyātva and Asanyama; therefore, it should be considered superior to Deshāvadhi.

[512]  Chapter on Knowledge in the Six Angas

[4, 1, 5] The knowledge that is the object of all is called Sarvavadhi. Salutations to the Jinas who possess this Sarvavadhi. [4]

Here, the word 'Sarva' should not be taken to mean all substances, but only the substance that is the essence of all (pudgala). This is because the object of Avadhi knowledge is substance, not non-substance.

Salutations to the infinite Jinas. [5]

Salutations to the Jinas who possess infinite and limitless knowledge, whose object of knowledge has no end or limit.

Salutations to the Jinas who possess Koṣṭha-buddhi. [6]

Koṣṭha means a container (a special vessel made of clay for storing grain). Just as a Koṣṭha is capable of holding many types of grains like wheat, barley, etc., so too, the intellect that is capable of grasping all categories of substances is called Koṣṭha-buddhi. Salutations to the Jinas who possess this Koṣṭha-buddhi. Although the word 'Jina' is not present in the sutra, it should be understood from the previous sutras, both here and in the following.

Salutations to the Jinas who possess Bīja-buddhi. [7]

Just as a seed is the basis for the root, sprout, leaves, branches, and trunk, so too, the word that is the basis for the meaning of the twelve Angas is called Bīja, because it is like a seed. The knowledge of the mind that takes this Bīja word as its object is also called 'Bīja' because of its role as a cause. In other words, the intellect that grasps this Bīja word, which is connected to infinite meanings through countable words, should be understood as Bīja-buddhi. Just as a seed sown in fertile land that has been properly tilled, with the help of suitable materials like time, etc., produces abundant grain, so too, the Jiva, with the help of this Bīja-buddhi, which is obtained through the destruction and cessation of the nine Indriya-avarana, Śruta-jñāna-avarana, and Vīrya-antarāya, is able to grasp a single Bīja word and through it, grasp many objects. Salutations to the Jinas who possess this Bīja-buddhi. This is the meaning of the sutra.

Salutations to the Jinas who possess the power of Padānusārī. [8]

[4, 1, 10]
Since the purpose of the proof-word, middle-word, etc. is not served here, due to the difference in the number of words, proof-word, middle-word, etc., the seed-word should be taken. The intellect that follows or imitates the intellect-word is called the intellect-following intellect. The meaning is that by knowing the seed-word from the seed-intellect, here this is the gender of these letters and not these; by thinking in this way, the intellect that takes all the letters-words of the scripture is to be understood as the intellect-following intellect. That intellect-following intellect is of three types, according to the difference of following, counter-following, and both-following. The intellect that knows the lower words from the seed-word with the gender situated in the seed-word is called the counter-following intellect. The one that knows the upper words from it, contrary to this, is called the following intellect. The one that knows the words situated in the side parts of the said seed-word according to the rule or even without the rule should be known as the both-following intellect. Here, those intellect-following ones are saluted.
Namo Sambhinna-Sodaraanam. || 9 ||
Salutations to the Sambhinna-Srotaa Jinas. || 9 ||
Those who can take many letters-words and non-letters-words together with the excellent destruction and pacification of the ear-sense, scripture-knowledge-obstruction, and vigor-obstruction are called Sambhinna-Srotaa. They are able to take the letters-words and non-letters-words produced together at the same time of the elephant, horse, camel, and human beings, etc., situated in the Chakravarti's rampart, which is twelve yojanas long and nine yojanas wide. If those Sambhinna-Srotaa hear the words of four Akshauhinis of elephants, horses, etc., speaking together in their own language, they can answer them separately and together. Salutations to those Sambhinna-Srotaa Jinas.
Namo Ujumati-Manah-Paryaya-Jnanaanam. || 10 ||
Salutations to the Riju-mati-Manah-Paryaya-Jnani. || 10 ||
The meaning of Riju is simple or without curvature. By Mati, the meaning is of the object situated in the other's Mati (thought-frame). From this, the meaning is that those who know the mental, verbal, and bodily objects of others simply are called Riju-mati-Manah-Paryaya-Jnani. These Riju-mati-Manah-Paryaya-Jnani know the simultaneous destruction of the inferior to the generous body with respect to the substance, and the simultaneous destruction of the eye-sense with respect to the excellence. With respect to the field, they know the meaning of the field-dweller, which is inferior to the Gavyu-ti-prithaktva (3 kos to 9 kos) and superior to the Yojan-prithaktva measure. With respect to time, they know the two bhava (past and future, along with the present bhava, making three bhava) which are inferior to the past and future, and the seven bhava (along with the present bhava, making eight bhava) which are superior. With respect to the state, they know the innumerable parts of the state (Paryaya) which are inferior to the inferior substance-dweller and superior to the superior substance-dweller, and which are appropriate to that.

[514] The Veyana Khanda of the Chakkhandagama
[4, 1, 11] Know that all the middle options should be understood as being above the inferior and below the superior. Salutations to those Jinas who are knowers of the subtle mental states of the righteous.
Namo Viulamdiinam ||11||. Salutations to the Jinas who are knowers of the vast mental states. ||11||
The word Vipula means vast. This means that those who know the mental, verbal, and physical objects of others through simplicity, crookedness, and both forms are called Vipulamati-Manahparyayajnani. They know the time-like sensory decay from the inferior in relation to substance, and the infinite part of the mental substance class from the superior. In relation to the field, they know the object within the field of the form of the distance of a yojana from the inferior, and the object located within the human field of forty-five lakh yojanas in measure of the form of cubic volume from the superior. In relation to time, they know seven to eight existences from the inferior, and countless existences from the superior. In relation to the state, they know the countless states of the substance that is their object. Salutations to such Vipulamati-Manahparyayajnani Jinas.
Namo Daspubbianam ||12|| Salutations to the ten previous Jinas. ||12||
These ten previous Jinas are of two types, different and non-different. When they are present after reading the eleven angas, and then the five authorities of parikarma, sutra, pratham-anuyog, purvagata, and chulika, divided into the vision-doctrine, and when the tenth vidya-anuprava-purva is completed in the order of utpada-purva, etc., and when seven hundred minor vidyas are perfected and they say, "O Bhagavan, what is your command?", then the one who obtains the greed for all those vidyas is called the different ten previous. But the one who does not obtain greed for them because of the desire for karma-kshaya is called the non-different ten previous. Here, salutations are offered to the non-different ten previous Jinas.
Namo Chodaspubbianam ||13|| Salutations to the fourteen previous Shruta-kevali Jinas. ||13|| Namo Atumgamhaanimittkusalanam ||14|| Salutations to the Jinas who have attained skill in the eight great nimittas. ||14||
These eight great nimittas are: anga, svar, vyanjana, lakshana, chhinna, bhouma, svapna, and antariksha.
1. Seeing the limbs and parts of humans and animals, along with their vata-pitta, etc., nature, seven dhatus, and varna-rasa, etc., and knowing the happiness-suffering, etc., related to the three times; this is called the anga great nimitta. 2. Hearing the many types of sounds of humans and animals, and knowing the happiness-suffering, etc., related to the three times; this is called the svar great nimitta. 3. The head, face, and shoulders

[515] Seeing the sesame and mustard seeds etc. situated at the beginning, the knowledge of happiness-suffering etc. related to the three times is called the great sign of Vyañjana. 4. Seeing the symbols of Svastika, Nandyāvarta, Śrīvṛkṣa, Śaṅkha, Cakra, Candra, Sūrya, and Kamala etc. present on the hands and feet, the knowledge of the glory of the titles of Tīrthaṅkara, Cakravartī, and Baladeva etc. is called the great sign of Lakṣaṇa. The implication is that if there are one hundred and eight of the above-mentioned symbols, it should be understood that the attainment of the titles of Tīrthaṅkara, sixty-four Cakravartī, and thirty-two Baladeva etc. (Nārāyaṇa-Pratinārayaṇa) should be understood. 5. Knowing the happiness-suffering of the three times by seeing the reversal of the body-shadow and the weapons, clothes, and ornaments etc. pierced by the gods, demons, rākṣasas, and humans-animals is called the great sign of Chinna. 6. Knowing the location of gold, silver, and copper etc. by seeing the density and smooth-rough etc. qualities of the earth, and knowing the victory-defeat etc. by seeing the army etc. situated in the eastern etc. directions is called the great sign of Bhūma. 7. Hearing the auspicious dreams of the form of the moon, sun etc. and the inauspicious dreams of the form of oil bathing etc. free from the defects of wind etc. at the end of the night and knowing the future happiness-suffering etc. is called the great sign of Svapna. That dream is of two types - Chinnassvapna and Mālāsvapna. Among them, seeing an elephant, lion etc. unrelated to each other is called Chinnassvapna, such as the sixteen dreams seen by the mother of the Jinas. The dream seen related to the previous-subsequent events is called Mālāsvapna. 8. Knowing the happiness-suffering etc. by seeing the rise and setting of the sun, moon, and planets-stars is called the great sign of Antarikṣa. Salutation is made here to those who are skilled in these eight great signs.

Aṇimā, Mahimā, Laghimā, Prāpti, Prākāmya, Īśitva, Vaśitva and Kāmarūpitva; Vaikriyika Riddhi is of this eight types. Among them, the ability to contract the body to the size of an atom is called Aṇimā Riddhi. Making the atomic-sized body equal to the size of Mount Meru is called Mahimā Riddhi. The power that enables movement on the threads of a spider is called Laghimā. The ability to touch the images of the moon and sun with the hand while standing on the earth is called Prāpti Riddhi.

[4, 1, 16
Namo Vijjahaaranaam ||16|| Salutations to the Jinas who are the possessors of knowledge || 16 ||
There are three types of knowledge: Jaati-vidya, Kula-vidya, and Tap-vidya. Jaati-vidya is the knowledge acquired from the maternal side, Kula-vidya is the knowledge acquired from the paternal side, and Tap-vidya is the knowledge attained through austerities like Mahopvaas etc. Those who possess these types of knowledge are called Vidyadharas. Here, we are paying our respects to those Vidyadharas who have renounced their knowledge and embraced asceticism, leaving behind the Vidyadharas who reside on Mount Vijaya and are unrestrained, and those who do not desire to use their attained knowledge.
Namo Chaaranaam ||17|| Salutations to the Jinas who are the possessors of the Charana-Riddhi || 17 ||
There are eight types of Jinas who possess the Charana-Riddhi, classified according to water, thighs, thread, fruit, flower, seed, sky, and series.
Those who can walk over water like the earth, without touching it and without causing harm to the aquatic beings, are called Jalacharana. Similarly, those who can walk over thread, fruit, flower, and seed are called Tantuchara, Phalachara, Pushpachara, and Beejachara respectively. Those who can travel hundreds of yojanas without harming the earth-dwelling beings are called Janghachara. Those who can ascend using smoke, fire, mountains, trees, and groups of threads are called Shrenichaara. Those who can walk in the sky, four fingers above the ground, are called Aakashchara. We pay our respects to these Charana-Rishi-Ishwaras.
Namo Panna-Samanaam || 18 || Salutations to the Prajna-Shramanas || 18 ||
There are four types of Prajna: Aaupattik, Vainayik, Karmaja, and Parinaamik. Aaupattik Prajna is the knowledge that arises from the pure intellect of the previous birth, which enables one to understand the twelve Angas with humility. Those who are born first in the heavens and then in the human realm with their uncorrupted karmas, possess this knowledge. Even though they do not engage in reading, listening, or asking, they are still endowed with this intellect. This intellect is called Aaupattik Prajna. Such Aaupattik-Prajna-Shramanas, even though they become emaciated due to six months of fasting, still engage in asking questions to reveal the greatness of this intellect, and they answer even the fourteen-fold questions. The knowledge that arises from studying the twelve Angas with humility is called Vainayik Prajna.

The **iddhi** by the influence of which a being can travel through the sky while standing, or by sitting in **padmasana** or other **kayotsarga** postures, is called **Aagasaagami** **iddhi**. It should be understood that the holders of this **Aagasaagami** **iddhi**, while traveling through the sky, do not harm any beings due to their skill in upholding **charitra**, and they travel through the sky only after taking steps. But the holders of **Aagasaagami** **iddhi** are not able to prevent the suffering of beings while traveling through the sky in **padmasana** and other postures like **kayotsarga**.

Here, it should be understood that the Jinas, who are endowed with such power of speech, never use this **iddhi** to control or favor other beings, because if they did, they would not be Jinas. Through this sutra, the Jinas who hold this **Aasiviṣa** **iddhi** are being saluted.
**Namo Didvivisaanam** || 21 || Salutations to the **Dṛṣṭiviṣa** Jinas || 21 ||
The **iddhi** by the influence of which, a being who is looked at with an angry gaze by a great **tapasvi** **sadhu**, immediately dies from poison, is called **Dṛṣṭiviṣa** **iddhi**. Here, the word **dṛṣṭi** should also include the mind. This means that the **sadhu** who holds **Dṛṣṭiviṣa** **iddhi**, if they think about someone dying with their mind, that person immediately dies. This is the meaning that should be understood. Here, the Jinas who hold this **Dṛṣṭiviṣa** **iddhi** are being saluted.

There are two types of Ugratap-Riddhi-dharak: Ugrogratap-Riddhi-dharak and Avasthit Ugratap-Riddhi-dharak. The one who, after observing one fast and performing Parana, observes two fasts, then three fasts in succession, and so on, increasing the number of fasts by one each time, and continues to observe fasts throughout his life, is considered to be an Ugrogratap-Riddhi-dharak Sadhu. The one who observes one fast and performs Parana at the time of initiation, and then, after an interval of one day, becomes a Shashtopavasin due to some reason, then, while observing the Shashtopavas, becomes an Ashtamopavasin, and in this way, without falling below the level of Dasham and Dwadashm, continues to observe fasts throughout his life, is called an Avasthit Ugratap-Riddhi-dharak. The ultimate fruit of both these tapas is Moksha, while other fruits like heaven are inferior. These Ugratap-Riddhi-dharak Jinas have been saluted here.

**Namo Ditta-tavanam || 23 ||**
Salutations to the Dipta-tap-Riddhi-dharak Jinas || 23 ||

The Dipta-Riddhi is the unparalleled brilliance that arises in the body of a Sadhu due to the influence of observing Shashtopavas etc. in the fourth body. The Sadhu who possesses this Riddhi is called a Dipta-tap. These Dipta-tap-Riddhi-dharak Jinas have been saluted here.

**Namo Tatta-tavanam || 24 ||**
Salutations to the Tapta-tap-Riddhi-dharak Jinas || 24 ||

The Tapta-tap is the tapa by which urine, feces, semen, etc. become Tapta, i.e., ashes. The Jinas possessing this Riddhi, mentioned in this Sutra, have been saluted.

**Namo Mahat-tavanam || 25 ||**
Salutations to the Mahatap-Riddhi-dharak Jinas || 25 ||

Those who, by the power of the four knowledges - Mati, Shruta, Avadhi, and Manahparyaya - observe all kinds of great fasts like Mandar-pankti, Simhanikridit, etc., are the possessors of this Mahatap-Riddhi. This Sutra means that salutations be offered to those Mahatap-Riddhi-dharak Munivar with mind, speech, and body.

**Namo Ghorat-tavanam || 26 ||**
Salutations to the Ghoratap-Riddhi-dharak Jinas || 26 ||

Among fasts, the six-month fast; among Avamodarya tapas, the one-bite tapa; among Vritti-parisankhyas, the vow of begging alms at the four-way intersection (Chaurastha); among Rasa-parityagas, the consumption of food with hot water and rice; among Vivikta-shayyasanas, the dwelling in forests inhabited by ferocious animals like wolves and tigers; among Kayakleshas, the intense Himalayan, etc.

[4, 1, 32]  Through the power of *kadiyaniyoga* (intense meditation), they have attained the power of *ghoraguna* (intense virtues).
[519]  Those who practice intense austerities, meditating under the open sky or at the roots of trees, and who also practice difficult internal austerities, are the possessors of *ghoratapariddhi* (intense austerity power).  This sutra means: Salutations to these *ghoratapariddhi* sages.
*Namo ghoraparakamanam* || 27 || Salutations to the Jinas, the possessors of *ghoraparakrama* (intense power) || 27 ||
The power to subdue the three worlds, to swallow the earth, to dry up all the oceans, and to rain down water, fire, and rocks, is called *ghoraparakrama*.  This sutra means: Salutations to the Jinas, the possessors of *ghoraparakrama* power.

*Namo ghoragunabamcharinanam* || 29 || Salutations to the Jinas who are *aghoragunabrahmachari* (possessors of peaceful virtues) || 29 ||
The five great vows, the five *samitis* (observances), and the three *guptis* (secrets) are the essence of *brahma* (conduct).  *Aghora* means peaceful.  Thus, those great sages who practice *brahma* with peaceful virtues are called *aghorabrahmachari*.  The meaning is that those ascetics who are able to stop national revolutions, plagues, famines, and killings and imprisonments due to the power of their austerities should be known as *aghorabrahmachari*.  Here, due to a grammatical rule, the *a* sound has been omitted from the sutra.  Salutations to those *aghorabrahmachari* Jinas.
*Namo amosahiptananam* || 30 || Salutations to the sages who have attained *amaushaidhi* (medicinal touch) || 30 ||
Those whose touch has the power of medicine are said to have attained *amaushaidhi* power.  The meaning is that those great sages whose touch has become capable of all kinds of medicine due to the power of their austerities are called *amaushaidhiprapt*.  Salutations to them.
*Namo kheloosahiptananam* || 31 || Salutations to the sages who have attained *khelaushaidhi* (medicinal phlegm, saliva, etc.) || 31 ||

**Those who have attained the medicinal quality of all substances like rasa, blood, flesh, fat, bone, marrow, semen, lungs, and excreta-urine, etc. are called *sarvauṣadhiprāpta jin*. Salutations to them. || 35 ||**

**Salutations to the *manabali* (strong-minded) *jin*. || 35 ||**

**The ability to continuously contemplate the six substances, which are filled with infinite meanings and synonyms related to the three times (past, present, future) as described in the twelve angas, without experiencing any sorrow, is called *manabali*. Those who possess this *manabali* are called *manabali*. Salutations to those *manabali* sages. || 36 ||**

**Salutations to the *vacanabali* (strong-spoken) sages. || 36 ||**

**Those who do not experience sorrow even after repeatedly reciting the twelve angas are called *vacanabali*. Salutations to them. || 37 ||**

**Salutations to the *kṣīrasravī* (milk-flowing) *jin*. || 38 ||**

**The meaning of *kṣīra* is milk. The power that transforms dry food held in the hand into milk immediately is called *kṣīrasravī* power. Or, the power that makes words sound sweet like milk is also called *kṣīrasravī* power. Salutations to the *jin* who possess this *kṣīrasravī* power. || 38 ||**

By the power of the Kadinayoga, the proof of the contradiction of the seven types of ghee
[521
Salutations to the ghee-flowing ones. || 39 || Salutations to the ghee-flowing Jinas. || 39 ||
The word "sarpis" means ghee. Those whose entire food, which falls into their cupped hands due to the effect of tapas, is transformed into the form of ghee, are called "sarpisravi". Salutations to them.
Salutations to the honey-flowing ones. || 40 || Salutations to the honey-flowing Jinas. || 40 ||
The word "madhu" is understood to mean jaggery, sugar, and sugar candy. Those who are able to transform all the food held in their hands into the taste of jaggery, sugar, and sugar candy are the honey-flowing Jinas. Salutations to them with mind, speech, and body.
Salutations to the nectar-flowing ones. || 41 || Salutations to the nectar-flowing Jinas. || 41 ||
Those whose food, when it comes into their hands, is transformed into the form of nectar, are the nectar-flowing Jinas. Salutations to those nectar-flowing Jinas, this is the meaning of the sutra.
Salutations to the inexhaustible great-fire-possessing ones. || 42 || Salutations to the inexhaustible great-fire-possessing Jinas. || 42 ||
Since the word "akshinamahanasa" is a marker of a place, it also includes the inexhaustible-dwelling Jinas. The meaning is that those great sages who, after consuming food, do not suffer any harm even if the entire food of the Chakravarti is consumed by their service, are called inexhaustible great-fire-possessing. Similarly, those whose four-hand-measure cave can accommodate the entire army of the Chakravarti, are called inexhaustible-dwelling. Salutations to those inexhaustible great-fire-possessing Jinas.
Salutations to all the Siddha-abodes in the world. || 43 || Salutations to all the Siddha-abodes in the world. || 43 ||
The phrase "all Siddhas" should be understood here to include all the Jinas mentioned earlier, because apart from those Jinas, no other country-Siddha or all-Siddha is found. The abodes of all the Siddhas are called Siddha-abodes. This should also include the artificial and non-artificial Jina temples, Jina images, and the areas of Ishatpragbhar, Urjayant, Champapur, and Pavana Nagar, as well as the prohibitions. Salutations to those Siddha-abodes.

Namo Vaddhamana Buddharissassa ||44||  Salutations to the Vaddhamana Buddha Rishi ||44||
Thus, after paying homage with 44 sutras, the following sutras are spoken to reveal the connection of the text.
Aggeṇiyassa Puvassa Pancamassa Vatthussa Chauttho Pahudo Kammapayadī Nāma ||45|| The fourth prabhruta of the fifth vastu of the Aggaṇīya Pūrvaka is called Kammapayadī ||45||
In the twelve angas, the one called Drishtivada, the five divisions of which are the Pūrvagata, are fourteen in number, differentiated by the divisions of Utpadapūrvaka, Aggaṇīyapūrvaka, etc. Of these, the second, Aggaṇīyapūrvaka, has fourteen adhikāras known as ‘Vastu’. These are: Pūrvānta, Aparānta, Ruva, Adhruva, Chayanalabdhi, Avasapraṇidhāna, Kalpa, Artha, Bhaubhāvayādya, Sarvārtha, Kalpaniryaṇa, Atīta-Anāgatakāla, Siddha, and Buddha. Of these, the fifth adhikāra, Chayanalabdhi, is the subject here. Of the twenty prabhruta in it, the fourth prabhruta, Kammapayadī prabhruta, is the one intended here. It has twenty-four adhikāras: Kriti, Vedana, Sparsha, Karma, Prakṛiti, Bandhana, Nibandhana, Prakram, Upkram, Udaya, Moksha, Sankram, Leshyā, Leshyākarma, Leshyāpariṇāma, Sāta-Asāta, Dīrgha-Hrasva, Bhavadhāranīya, Pudgalātta, Nidhatta-Anidhatta, Nikāchita-Annikāchita, Karmasthiti, Paschima-Skandha, and Alp-Bahutva. Of these twenty-four adhikāras, the first, Kriti, is the subject of the Anuyogadvara. The following sutra is spoken to explain the form of this Kriti Anuyogadvara.
Kadi Tti Sataviha Kadi-Nāmakadī Thavaṇakadī Davvakadī Gaṇanakadī Gandhakadī Karaṇakadī Bhāvakadī Chedi ||46||
_Kriti is of seven types: Nāmakriti, Sthāpanākriti, Dravyakriti, Gaṇanākriti, Granthakriti, Karaṇakriti, and Bhāvakriti ||46||
The meaning of these is explained by the sutrakar himself later, so their form is not specified here. Now, to explain which kritis are desired for which nayas, the following sutra-arrangement is obtained.
Kadiṇayavibhāsaṇadāe Ko ṇao Kāo Kadiyo Icchhadi 1||47|| In the explanation of the nayas of kritis, which nay desires which kritis? ||47|| ṇaigama-chavahāra-sangaha savvāo ||48|| The naigama, vyavahāra, and sangraha nayas accept all kritis ||48|| Ujusudo ḍhavaṇakadīṁ ṇecchhadi ||49|| The ṛjusūtra nay does not accept sthāpanākriti ||49||

(4, 1, 52)  Kad'aniyoga-dvare nayavibhasanada
[523 _ The meaning is that except for the establishment-action, all other actions are accepted. The straight-sutra nay is of two types, pure and impure. Here, the impure straight-sutra nay is intended, because, except for the establishment-action, all other actions can be its subject. The pure straight-sutra nay, because it makes the meaning-synonyms its subject, only makes the feeling-action its subject, it does not accept any other action except that.
Sad'd'ao nam'akadin' bhav'akadin' cha ichchhanti || 50 || Word-etc. nay accepts name-action and feeling-action || 50 || In this way, the statement of the nay-subject of the said actions is now done by the deposition-formulation

That which is the name-action is one living being, one non-living being, many living beings, many non-living beings, one living being and one non-living being, one living being and many non-living beings; many living beings and one non-living being, and many living beings and many non-living beings, in which 'action' is called such, that is all called name-action || 51 ||
Name-action is the subject of the above eight, one and many living beings, etc., because, more than these, breaking is not possible. In these eight breakings, that which is called 'action' is, by the difference of the 'action' designation residing in itself, obtained in eight types and in crores of differences by the difference of the avantar. That is all called name-action.
Ja sa thavan'akadi nam' sa katt'hakammesu va chitt'hakammesu va pott'hakammesu va lepp'yakammesu va len'akammesu va sel'akammesu va gih'akammesu va bhittikammesu va dantakammesu va bhed'akammesu va akkho va vara'd'ao va je chaman'ne ev'amadiya thavan'ae thavij'jati kad'i ti sa savva thavan'akadi nam' ||52||
That which is the establishment-action is in wood-work, or in painting, or in pottery, or in plastering, or in melting, or in stone-work, or in house-work, or in wall-work, or in tooth-work, or in bhend'akas, or in aksha or vara'd'aka; and those which are established by this type of establishment, starting from these, are all called establishment-action || 52 ||
Establishment is of two types, by the difference of good-establishment and bad-establishment. Here, some examples of good-establishment are given first - dancing, laughing, singing, and playing instruments like turai and vina, etc., in the actions of the gods, hell-dwellers, animals and humans, made of wood, etc.

##  524]  The Chapter on Material Objects in the Six-Part Agama

[4, 1, 53]  The creation of images from wood is called "Kaṣṭha-karma".  The act of depicting gods, hell-beings, animals, and humans engaged in activities like dancing, etc., on cloth, walls, and boards is called "Citrakarma".  "Potta" means cloth.  Images made from cloth are called "Pottakarma".  "Lepya" refers to coatings made from grass, sugar, clay, etc.  Images made from these coatings are called "Lepyakarma".  "Layana" means mountain.  Images made from mountains are called "Layanakarma".  "Śaila" means stone.  Images made from stone are called "Śailakarma".  "Gṛha" here refers to Jain temples, etc.  Images made in these are called "Gṛhakarma".  This means that houses made in the form of a horse, elephant, human, or boar (pig), etc., are called "Gṛhakarma".  Images carved into the walls of a house are called "Bhittikarma".  Images carved on elephant tusks are called "Dantakarma".  Images made from ivory are called "Bheṇḍakarma".  These are ten examples of "Sadbhāva-sthāpanā" (establishment of harmony).

Examples of "Asadbhāva-sthāpanā" (establishment of disharmony) should be understood as "Akṣa" and "Varāṭaka", etc.  The word "Akṣa" refers to dice used in gambling and the axle of a cart, and the word "Varāṭaka" refers to cowries.  Here, "Stambhakarma", "Tulākarma", "Halakarma", and "Musalakarma", etc., should be understood as examples.  That in which something is established is called "Sthāpanā".  "Amā" means "abheda" (non-differentiation), i.e., "Sthāpanā" (establishment) in the form of "Sadbhāva" (harmony) and "Asadbhāva" (disharmony).  Those things that are established in this way are called "Sthāpanā-kṛti".

"Jā sā dabakadī ṇām sā duviha āgamdo davvakadī ceva ṇoāgamdo davvakadī ceva || 53 ||"

That which is "Dravyakṛti" (material object) is of two types: "Āgamda-dravyakṛti" (material object based on Agama) and "Noāgamda-dravyakṛti" (material object not based on Agama).

"Āgama", "Siddhānta", and "Śruta-jñāna" (scriptural knowledge) all have the same meaning.  That which is free from the group of defects like "Āpta-vacana" (authoritative statement), "Pūrvāpara-virodha" (contradiction between earlier and later statements), etc., and illuminates all things is called "Āgama".  That which is made from material objects based on this "Āgama" is called "Āgamda-dravyakṛti".  One should understand "Noāgamda-dravyakṛti" as different from this "Āgamda-dravyakṛti".  Thus, having described the two types of "Dravyakṛti" (material object), the next sūtra (aphorism) is spoken to describe the types of "Āgama".

"Jā sā āgamdo davvakadī ṇām tissie ime aṭṭahāhiyārā bhavanti-dvi-daṁ jidaṁ parijidaṁ vāyaṇopagadaṁ suttasamaṁ atthasamaṁ ganthasamaṁ nāmasamaṁ ghoṣasamaṁ || 54 ||"

That which is "Dravyakṛti" (material object) based on "Āgama" has these eight "Artha-adhikāra" (meaningful authorities): "Sthita" (established), "Jita" (conquered), "Parijita" (fully conquered), "Vācanopagata" (based on scripture), "Sūtrasama" (consistent with sūtras), "Arthasama" (consistent with meaning), "Granthasama" (consistent with text), "Nāmasama" (consistent with name), and "Ghoṣasama" (consistent with proclamation). || 54 ||

These are the nine authorities of "Āgama".  Among these, the person who gradually progresses in "Bhāvāgama" (knowledge of the essence) like an old man or a sick person, is a person with that type of "Saṁskāra" (impression) and that "Bhāvāgama" as well.

[526] In the Chakkhandagama, the Veyanakhandam
[4, 1, 56] The nine Agamas are the subject of reading, questioning, accepting, changing, observing, praising, glorifying, Dharmakatha, and other uses, including those that are derived from these. [55]
The act of explaining the meaning of the nine Agamas to other worthy beings, according to their capacity, is called the use of reading. Asking about the meaning of a subject that is not known in the said Agamas is called the use of questioning. The act of determining the meaning stated by the Acharya Bhattarakas is called the use of accepting. The act of repeatedly examining the Bhavagama in order to prevent the forgotten meaning from being forgotten is called the use of changing. The act of examining the Shruta-knowledge that has been fully understood in the heart for the purpose of karma-nirjara is called the use of observing. The act of concluding the twelve Angas with the primacy of the subject of all the Angas is called praise. The use of reading, questioning, changing, and observing that is inherent in this is also called praise by way of treatment. The act of concluding one Anga in the twelve Angas is called glorification. Similarly, the use that occurs in it should also be known as glorification. The act of concluding one Anga, one authority, and the use related to it is called Dharmakatha. The phrase "including those that are derived from these" in the Sutra implies that the uses related to the conclusion of other works such as Kriti, Anuyoga, and Vedana, which are authorities, should also be accepted. Although the word "use" is not in the Sutra, it should be included here by implication. Thus, these eight uses of Shruta-knowledge are mentioned here.
Here, Kriti Anuyoga is the subject. These uses related to it should be understood as follows: Explaining the meaning of Kriti to other beings is called reading. Asking about the unknown meaning of the subject of Kriti is called questioning. The act of determining the meaning that is to be explained is called accepting. The act of repeatedly examining the meaning of Kriti in order to prevent forgetting is called changing. The act of repeatedly considering the Kriti that has been integrated with the body for the purpose of karma-nirjara is called observing. The use of all the Anuyoga doors related to the conclusion of Kriti is called praise. The use related to one Anuyoga door of Kriti is called glorification. The use related to one Marganga is called Dharmakatha. Thus, these are the eight uses related to Kriti.
A being who is different from these uses, whether he is with the destruction and pacification of the Shruta-knowledge covering or he is with the destroyed destruction and pacification of it, is called unsuitable.
Now, the unsuitable ones are explained with the support of Nayas.
Negama-Chavaharana-mego Anuvajutto Agama-do Davvakdi Anya Anya-vajutto Agama-do Davvakdi. [56]
According to the Negama and Vyavahara Nayas, one unsuitable being is a Dravyakriti from the Agama, or many unsuitable beings are Dravyakritis from the Agama. [56]

Further, the special forms of these three **kriti**s are explained.
That which is **jñāyakasārīradavvakadī** has these **arthādhikāra**s: **sthita**, **jita**, **parijita**, **vācaṇopāgata**, **sūtrasama**, **arthasama**, **granthasama**, **nāmasama**, and **ghosasama**. || 62 ||
Among them, the **kriti**-related **anuyoaga** present in its own subject is called **sthita**.

The **kriti**-related **anuyoaga** that is capable of moving in its own subject at a very fast pace without obstruction, like a potter's wheel that is spun very fast, is called **parijita**. The **śruta**-knowledge related to the **kriti**-subject, which is obtained in the form of **nanda-bhadra** etc., is called **vācaṇopāgata**. The **bījapada** that comes out of the mouth of **jina** **bhagavān** and is capable of grasping infinite meanings is called **sūtra**. The **kriti**-related **anuyoaga** that arises in **gaṇadhara** **deva**s through this **sūtra** is called **sūtrasama**. The **kriti**-related **anuyoaga** that arises in **svayambuddha**s due to the influence of **saṁyama** without **grantha** and **bījapada**, is called **arthasama** because it stays with the meaning. **arhanta**

Chapter on the Classification of Knowledge in the Six Angas
[4, 1, 63]
The name "Grantha" is given to the collection of words whose meaning has been explained by the Devas and which has been compiled by the Ganadharas. The Kriti-Anuyoga, which originated from it and which resides in the Sthaviras like Bhadrabahu, is called "Grantha-Sama". The Kriti-Anuyoga, which is deficient in one or two letters, etc., due to the ignorance of foolish men, is called "Nana-Minotti", meaning "that which takes on many meanings". According to this etymology, it is called "Nama". The Bhava-Kriti-Anuyoga, which resides with it, is called "Nama-Sama". One Anuyoga, which originates from that Kriti-Anuyoga, is called "Ghosa". The Kriti-Anuyoga that originates from it, and also the Kriti-Anuyoga that does not originate from it but is similar to it, are both called "Ghosa-Sama". Thus, since the Kriti-Anuyoga is of nine types, its knowers are also nine.
The body of that knower of the Kriti-Prabhruta, who has fallen, perished, and abandoned his body, is called "Jnanaka-Sarira-Dravya-Kriti". || 63 ||
The knower of the Kriti-Prabhruta, whose body has perished due to the decay of life, is called "Cyuta-Deha". The knower of the Kriti-Prabhruta, whose body has perished due to an upsarga, is called "Vyavita-Deha". The knower of the Kriti-Prabhruta, who abandons his body through the methods of Bhakta-Pratyakhyana, Ingini, and Prayopagamana, is called "Tyakta-Deha". Since the bodies of these Cyuta, Vyavita, and Tyakta knowers of the Kriti-Prabhruta are like this, they are all called "Jnanaka-Sarira-Dravya-Kriti".
The nature of that "Bhavy-Dravya-Kriti" is as follows: that which is established through these Kriti-Anuyoga doors, which is the cause of its future creation, but which is not currently doing it, is called "Bhavy-Dravya-Kriti". || 64 ||
The "Jnanaka-Sarira" and the "Bhavy-Vyatirikta-Dravya-Kriti" are of many types. They are as follows: Granthim, Vaim, Vedim, Purim, Sanghatim, Ahodim, Nikkhodim, Ovellim, Udvellim, Varna, Churna, Gandha, and Vilepana, etc., and others that are similar to these, are all called "Jnanaka-Sarira-Bhavy-Vyatirikta-Dravya-Kriti". || 65 ||

[4, 1, 66]  The term "Gannakadī" refers to the various ways of counting. 
[529]  Substances like garlands, which are created by the process of intertwining, are called "Granthim". Substances like soup, baskets, sieves, blankets, and clothes, which are created by the process of weaving, are called "Baim". Substances like "Sūti" (a place for extracting Soma), "Indhuv" (a furnace), "Kosh" (a treasury), and "Paly" (a type of food), which are created by the process of "Vedana" (a type of action), are called "Vedim". Substances like the embankment of a pond and the platform of a Jain temple, which are created by the process of "Pūraṇa" (filling), are called "Pūrim". Substances like artificial Jain temples, houses, fortresses, and stupas, which are created by the process of combining wood, bricks, and stones, are called "Sanghātim". Substances like neem, mango, jamun, and jambir, which are created by the process of "Āhodim" (planting), are called "Āhodim". Here, the process of "Āhodim" should be understood to include the planting of both sentient and insentient beings. Substances like ponds, wells, and tunnels, which are created by the process of digging, are called "Nikkhodim". Substances like single, double, and triple ropes, which are created by the process of "Ovellan" (twisting), are called "Ovellim". Substances that are created by the process of extracting "Granthim" and "Baim" are called "Udvellīm". Substances like humans and horses, which are created by the actions of skilled artists and others, are called "Varṇa". Substances like "Piṣṭa" (flour), "Piṣṭikā" (a type of cake), and "Kaṇikā" (a type of grain), which are created by the process of grinding, are called "Cūrṇa". Substances that are fragrant and created by the combination of many substances are called "Gandha". Substances like sandalwood and saffron, which are ground and rubbed, are called "Vilepana". The existence of substances like "Dvisamyoga" (a combination of two substances), which are created by joining and cutting, is explained by the phrase "taking these as the beginning, there are other substances". 
The term "Gannakadī" refers to various types of counting. For example, "one" is a "Nokadī" (a type of counting), "two" can be considered as "Avaktāvya" (not to be spoken) or "Nokadī", and "three" and onwards can be considered as "Sankhyejja" (countable), "Asankhyejja" (uncountable), or "Ananta" (infinite). All these are called "Gannakadī". 
"One" is a "Nokadī". This is because a quantity that increases when squared and a quantity that increases when its square root is subtracted from its square and then squared is called a "Kriti" (a type of number). Since "one" does not increase when squared and becomes rootless when its square root is subtracted from it, it is called a "Nokadī" as stated in the text. This "one" is merely a type of counting. 
Since "two" increases when squared, it cannot be called a "Nokadī". And since it does not increase when its square root is subtracted from its square and then squared, but remains the same as before, it cannot be called a "Kriti" either. Considering this, "two" is called "Avaktāvya". This is the second type of counting. 6.67

## Chapter 530: The Chapter on Veeyana from the Chhakkanndagama

**[4, 1, 67]**  Since any number, starting from three, when squared, increases, and when the square root is subtracted from it and squared again, the increase is also obtained; for this reason it is called 'Kriti'. This is the rule of the third type of calculation. There are no other types of calculation besides these three, because no other calculation is found except these three. The meaning is that when calculating 'one by one', it is called 'No-Kriti' calculation, when calculating 'two by two', it is called 'Aavaktvy' calculation, and when calculating 'three, four, and five' in sequence, it is called 'Kriti' calculation. Thus, there are only three types of calculation.

**[67]**  Whatever is called 'Granthakriti' is called 'Savya Granthakriti' in the world, in the Vedas, in the times, in the form of word references, and in the form of letters, by means of which the creation of literature is done.

- This 'Granthakriti' is of four types, based on its establishment, substance, and meaning. Among them, 'Bhaav Granthakriti' is of two types, based on 'Aagam' and 'No-Aagam'. Among these, the knowledgeable being who knows 'Praabhrut' is called 'Aagam Bhaav Granthakriti'. 'No-Aagam Bhaav Granthakriti' is of two types, based on 'Shruti' and 'No-Shruti'. Among these, 'Shruti' is of three types: 'Laukik', 'Vaidik', and 'Samayik'. Each of these is of two types, based on substance and meaning 'Shruti'. Among these, 'Shabdaatmak Dravyashruti' is embedded in 'No-Aagam Dravy Granthakriti'. Knowledge about subjects like elephants, horses, tantra, Kautilya, and Vatsyayana's Kamashastra is called 'Laukik Bhaav Shruti Granth'. Knowledge about subjects like 'Dwaadashaanga' is called 'Vaidik Bhaav Shruti Granth'. And knowledge about subjects like 'Nyaya', 'Vaisheshik', 'Lokayat', 'Saankhya', 'Mimaansa', and 'Buddhist' philosophies is called 'Samayik Bhaav Shruti Granth'. The creation of literature that deals with the meaning conveyed by these word references and letters is called 'Shruti Granthakriti'. 'No-Shruti Granthakriti' is of two types, based on 'Abhyantar' and 'Baahya'. Among these, 'Abhyantar No-Shruti Granthakriti' is of fourteen types, based on 'Mithyaatva', 'Three Vedas', 'Haasya', 'Rati', 'Arati', 'Shok', 'Bhay', 'Jugupsa', 'Krodh', 'Maan', 'Maya', and 'Lobh'. And 'Baahya No-Shruti Granthakriti' is of ten types, based on 'Kshetra', 'Vastu', 'Dhan', 'Dhanya', 'Dupad', 'Chatushpad', 'Yaan', 'Shayanasan', 'Kupy', and 'Bhaand'. These 'Kshetraadi Granth' (possessions) are caused by 'Abhyantar Granth', therefore, considering 'Vyavhaar Nay', they are also called 'Granth' by treating the cause as the effect. The abandonment of these is called 'Nirgranthata'. The term 'Granth' for the above fourteen, like 'Mithyaatva', should be understood considering 'Nishchay Nay', because they are the cause of 'Karmabandh'. The abandonment of these is called 'Nirgranthata'.

**[67]**  Whatever is called 'Karanakriti' is of two types: 'Mool Karanakriti' and 'Uttar Karanakriti'. Whatever is called 'Mool Karanakriti' is of five types: 'Oralaya Sharira Mool Karanakriti', 'Veubbiya Sharira Mool Karanakriti', ...

[4, 1, 69] Kadianiyoga by Kadiparuvana
[531 Kadi Aharasarira Mulakaranakadi Teyasarira Mulakaranakadi Kammaiyasarira Mulakaranakadi Chedi.
Karanakriti is of two types - Mulakaranakriti and Uttarakaranakriti. Among these, Mulakaranakriti is of five types - Audarikasharira Mulakaranakriti, Vaikriyikasharira Mulakaranakriti, Taijassharira Mulakaranakriti and Karmanasharira Mulakaranakriti. || 68 ||
In all Karans, the body is considered the Mulakaran, because the tendency of other Karans is due to it. It is of five types - Audarik, Vaikriyik, Aharak, Taijas and Karman. The combination of these five Shariraatmak Mulakarans is called Mulakaranakriti. The work of other Karans like sword, Vasula, Parshu and Kudari etc. other than the body should be known as Uttarakaranakriti. The work of all these is called 'Kriti' which is said according to the predominance of the meaning according to the Nirukti 'Kriyate iti Kriti'. According to the etymology 'Kriyate Anaya', the said Mula and Uttar Karans should be understood as Kriti according to the predominance of Karan. Now, to explain the differences in each of the above five differences, the next Sutra is obtained.
Ja Sa Oraliy Ubbiy-Aharasarira Mulakaranakadi Nam Sa Tiviha-Sanghadanakati Parishadanakati Sanghadana-Parishadanakati Chedi. Sa Savva Oraliy Ubbiy-Aharasarira Mulakaranakadi Nam. || 69 ||
The Audarik Vaikriyik-Aharaksharira Mulakaranakriti is of three types - Sanghatanakriti, Parishatanakriti and Sanghatan-Parishatanakriti. It is all Audarik, Vaikriyik and Aharak Sharira Mulakaranakriti. || 69 ||
Among these, the accumulation of the atoms of the desired body without their depletion is called Sanghatanakriti. The depletion of the Pudgalaskandhas of the same desired body without their accumulation is called Parishatanakriti. And the arrival and depletion of the Pudgalaskandhas of the desired body together is called Sanghatan-Parishatanakriti. Among them, at the time of the birth of Tiryanch and humans, there is only Sanghatanakriti of the Audarikasharira, because at that time the depletion of the Skandhas of the said body is not found. From the second time onwards, there is Sanghatan-Parishatanakriti of their Audarikasharira, because in the second and subsequent times, the arrival and depletion of the Skandhas of the Audarikasharira, which is infinite times less than the Abhyavya Siddhikas and infinite times less than the Siddhas, are found. And when Tiryanch and humans produce the Uttar Sharira, there is Parishatanakriti of the Audarikasharira, because at that time the arrival of the Skandhas of the Audarikasharira is not possible.
At the time of the birth of Devas and Narakas, there is Sanghatanakriti of the Vaikriyikasharira, because at that time the depletion of the Skandhas of the Vaikriyikasharira does not occur. In their second and subsequent times,

Page #657:

[532]
Veṇākhaṇḍa of the Ṣaṭkhaṇḍāgama
[4, 1, 70]
Its [the body's] creation-destruction activity is present because, at that time, both the arrival and the depletion of the skandhas of that body are seen simultaneously. And the production of the subsequent body and its entry into the original body is the destruction activity of the original body of the deva and the naraki, because, at that time, the arrival of the skandhas of that body does not occur.
Similarly, in the first instance of the production of the āhāra-śarīra, its creation activity, in the second and subsequent instances, its creation-destruction activity, and upon its entry into the original body, its destruction activity should be known. Whatever is the name of the tejas-karma-śarīra-mūla-karaṇa-kriyā, that is of two types - destruction activity and creation-destruction activity. That is all tejas-karma-śarīra-mūla-karaṇa-kriyā. || 70 ||
The destruction activity of these two bodies is present in the ayoga-kevali. The reason for this is that, due to the absence of their yoga, bondage has been completely destroyed. Except for the ayoga-kevali, all other worldly beings have the creation-destruction activity of these two bodies, because, in the world, both their arrival and depletion are found. The creation activity of these two bodies is not possible, because, due to the absence of bondage, sattva, and udaya, the possibility of the causes of bondage does not remain for the siddha beings, so the new bondage of these two bodies is not possible for them. All these are tejas-śarīra and karma-śarīra-rupa mūla-karaṇa-kriyā, it should be known.
In this way, having described the sattva of the mūla-karaṇa-kriyā through the above sūtras, now the description of the uttara-karaṇa-kriyā is done.
Whatever is the name of the uttara-karaṇa-kriyā, that is of many types. For example - asi, vāsi, paraśu, kudārī, chakra, daṇḍa, vema, nālikā, śalākā, mṛttikā, sūtra, and udaka, etc., are used in general activities. || 71 ||
Because they are the cause of all other karana, asi and vāsi, etc., should be understood as uttara-karaṇa.
Audārika, etc., five bodies remain with the jīva, therefore they are considered mūla-karaṇa. Because they are caused by them, they should be understood as uttara-karaṇa. That uttara-karaṇa-kriyā is of many types.
Those that take refuge in dravya are called upasampada, i.e., activity. The name of their proximity is upasampada-sānidhya, therefore, asi, vāsi, paraśu, kudārī, chakra, daṇḍa, vema, nālikā, śalākā, mṛttikā, sūtra, and udaka, etc., are called uttara-karaṇa due to the refuge of the proximity of these activities.

[535 The field, time, and causes of the said Vedana dravya have been discussed in the Dvara. 9. The eight forms of bhangarupa, which are jiva and nojiva, etc., are the owners of Vedana or not, their representation has been done in the Vedanaswamitva Anuyogadvara with the help of Nayas. 10. The various alternatives of Vedana, which are obtained from the difference of the bound, awakened, and quieted natures due to the combination of one, two, etc., have been represented in the Vedana Vidhan Anuyogadvara with the help of Nayas. 11. What is the state of Vedana obtained from the difference of dravya, etc., is it situated, non-situated, or situated-non-situated; this has been considered in the Vedana Gatividhan Anuyogadvara with the help of Nayas. 12. In the Vedana-Anantaravidhan Anuyogadvara, according to the Nayavivaksha, the representation of the karma pudgala skandhas, which are one-time-bound, many-time-bound, and both-bound, has been done according to the Nayavivaksha. 13. Which one of the dravya, field, time, and bhava forms of Vedana is the main one, the excellent, non-excellent, inferior, and non-inferior; the examination of this has been done in the Vedanasannikarashavidhan Anuyogadvara. 14. In the Vedana Parimavidhan Anuyogadvara, the representation of the measure of the original and subsequent natures has been done due to the difference of time and field of the natures. 15. The natures born in the prakrityarthata, sthityarthata, and kshetrapratyasa, how much part of all the natures are they in measure; this has been considered in the Vedana Bhaga Bhaga Vidhan Anuyogadvara. 16. And in the Vedana-Alp Bahutva Anuyogadvara, the representation of the alp bahutva of these three types of natures in relation to each other has been done.
In this way, the representation of these sixteen Anuyogadvaras has been done in this Vedana Mahaadhikari.

Among them, the word 'Vedana', which does not depend on the external object, is Namavedana, for one jiva and many jivas, etc., eight types.
The name Sthapanavedana is given to that which is established in another substance in the form of Vedana, without any difference, in the form of 'that Vedana is this'. That Sthapanavedana is of two types, due to the difference of Sadbhavasthapana and Asadbhavasthapana. Among them, establishing the desired Vedana dravya in that which is almost the same as the difference of dravya, is called Sadbhavasthapanavedana. Imagining the Vedana dravya in that which is not the same as the difference of dravya is called Asadbhavasthapanavedana.
Dravya Vedana is of two types - Agamdravyavedana and Noagamdravyavedana. The jiva which...

**Agam-Dravya-Vedana** is the knowledge of pain, but it is devoid of its use. **No-Agam-Dravya-Vedana** is of three types, based on the distinction of the knowing body, the future, and other than that. Among them, **Knowing-Body-No-Agam-Dravya-Vedana** is of three types, based on the distinction of the future, present, and abandoned. The being who is going to be transformed in the future due to the cause of **Vedana-Anuyogadwar** is **Future-No-Agam-Dravya-Vedana**. **No-Agam-Dravya-Vedana** other than that is of two types, based on the distinction of **Karma** and **No-Karma**. Among them, **Karma-No-Agam-Dravya-Vedana** is of eight types, based on the distinction of **Jnana-Avarana** etc., and **No-Karma-No-Agam-Dravya-Vedana** is of three types, based on the distinction of **Sachitta**, **Achitta**, and **Misra**. Among them, **Sachitta-Dravya-Vedana** is the **Siddh-Jiva-Dravya**. **Achitta-Dravya-Vedana** is the **Pudgala**, **Kala**, **Akasha**, **Dharma**, and **Adharma-Dravya**. **Misra-Dravya-Vedana** is the **Samsari-Jiva-Dravya**, because **Karma** and **No-Karma** are in **Samavaya** with the being, and it is not seen as different from the being and non-being.

**Bhava-Vedana** is of two types, based on the distinction of **Agam** and **No-Agam**. Among them, the being who is knowledgeable about **Vedana-Anuyogadwar** and is suitable in it is **Agam-Bhava-Vedana**. **No-Agam-Bhava-Vedana** is of two types, based on the distinction of **Jiva-Bhava-Vedana** and **Ajiv-Bhava-Vedana**. Among them, **Jiva-Bhava-Vedana** is of five types, based on the distinction of **Audayik** etc. The pain arising from the rise of eight types of **Karma** is **Audayik-Vedana**. The pain arising from the subsidence of **Karma** is **Aupashamik-Vedana**. The pain arising from their destruction is **Kshayik-Vedana**. The pain arising from their destruction and subsidence, which is in the form of **Avadhi-Jnana** etc., is **Kshayo-pashamik-Vedana**. The pain in the form of **Jivatva**, **Bhavya-tva**, and **Upayoga** etc., is **Parinamik-Vedana**. **Ajiv-Bhava-Vedana** is of two types - **Audayik** and **Parinamik**. Among them, each is of many types, based on the distinction of five tastes, five colors, two smells, and eight touches etc.

The classification of the pains. According to the Naigama and Vyavahara Naya, there are eight types of pains: Jnanavaraniyavedana, Darshanavaraniyavedana, Vedaniyavedana, Mohaniyavedana, Ayuvedana, Namavedana, Gotravedana, and Antarayavedana. || 1 ||
In this classification of the pains, the types of pains and their names are described. Accordingly, the No-Agama Karmavedana is described here according to the Dravyarthic (Naigama and Vyavahara) Naya. The eight types and their names are described here according to the present sutra. The terms Jnanavaraniyavedana etc. should be understood meaningfully. For example, the Karmadravya which covers the knowledge is called Jnanavaraniy Karmadravya. The pain which is of this Jnanavaraniyaswarupa should be understood as Jnanavaraniyavedana.
According to the Sangraha Naya, there is only one pain for all the eight Karmas. || 2 ||

[538] * **The Establishment of the Name "Vedanā"**
[4, 2, 3, 4] _Here, the establishment of the form of "Vedanā" should be made similar to the form of the support, because there is no special feature in it. In accordance with this Nay, while establishing the form of the name, one should say "eight kinds of Vedanā," because, in accordance with the Sangraha Nay, the number "eight" is possible for all the distinctions of the Karmas like Jñānāvaraṇa, etc. The word "Vedanā" used in the Sutra refers to the one "Vedanā" jāti, which is inseparable from all the distinctions of Vedanā, because without them, the Sangraha statement is not possible. The work of the Sangraha Nay is to collect all the distinctions by a common Dharma. The meaning is that, in accordance with the Naigama and Vyavahāra Nay, the natural Vedanā has been described as eight kinds. But this Sangraha Nay accepts one Vedanā jāti of all the eight Karmas, because, in the said Sangraha Nay, the predominance of non-difference is there. This is the reason why, in accordance with this Nay, one Vedanā of all the eight Karmas has been said.
Ujusudas-sa no-ṇāṇāvaraṇīya-vedanā no dassanāvaraṇīya-vedanā no mohaṇīya-vedanā no āuava-vedanā no nāma-vedanā no goda-vedanā no antarāiya-vedanā, veyaṇīyaṁ ceva vedanā ||
In accordance with the Ujusūtra Nay, there is neither Jñānāvaraṇīya Vedanā, nor Darśanāvaraṇīya Vedanā, nor Mohaṇīya Vedanā, nor Āyu Vedanā, nor Nāma Vedanā, nor Gotrā Vedanā, nor Antarāya Vedanā. In accordance with it, only the Vedanīya is Vedanā. || 3 ||
The meaning of Vedanā is pleasure-pain, because, such behaviour is seen in the world. These pleasure-pain do not arise from any other Karma dravyas except the Vedanīya-rupa Pudgala skandha. If it is possible for the said pleasure-pain to arise from any other Karma, then the Vedanīya Karma will have no work at all, therefore, the occasion of the absence of the said Vedanīya Karma will be inevitable, therefore, in the natural state, by negating all the Karmas, the Udayagata Vedanīya dravya has been called "Vedanā."
Sadda-nayassa vedanā ceva vedanā || 4 ||
In accordance with the Śabda Nay, Vedanā is Vedanā. || 4 ||
In accordance with the Śabda Nay, the pleasure-pain arising from the Udaya of the Vedanīya dravya Karma, or the result of the Jīva arising from the Udaya of the eight kinds, is called Vedanā. In accordance with this Nay, the Karma dravya cannot be called Vedanā, because, the subject of the Śabda Nay is not possible to be a dravya.
|| Thus, the establishment of the name "Vedanā" is completed through the Anuyo-gadvāra. || 3 ||

##  The Chapter on Vedana (Sensation) in the Chakkhandagama

[539 4. The nature of Vedana-dravya (Sensation-substance) is to be understood in terms of three Anuyogadwaras (gates of knowledge): Padamimamsa (analysis of terms), Swamitva (ownership), and Alp-bahutva (lesser-greater). || 1 ||]

This is the chapter on the nature of Vedana-dravya. In it, three Anuyogadwaras are to be understood: Padamimamsa, Swamitva, and Alp-bahutva.

The present chapter on the nature of Vedana-dravya, within the Anuyogadwaras, describes the nature of Vedana-dravya, which is in the form of sensation, in terms of its distinctions as Utkrushta (excellent), Anutkrushta (not excellent), Jaghanya (inferior), and Ajaghanya (not inferior). In this, the three Anuyogadwaras, Padamimamsa, Swamitva, and Alp-bahutva, are worthy of understanding. Of these, Padamimamsa, as an Anuyogadwara, analyzes the terms Utkrushta, Anutkrushta, etc. Swamitva, as an Anuyogadwara, describes the types of Jivas (living beings) who are worthy of these terms, Utkrushta, Anutkrushta, etc. And Alp-bahutva, as an Anuyogadwara, explains their lesser and greater qualities.

[Padamimamsa: What is Utkrushta (excellent), Anutkrushta (not excellent), Jaghanya (inferior), and Ajaghanya (not inferior) in relation to the Jnanavaraniya Vedana-dravya (Sensation-substance that veils knowledge)? || 2 ||]

Padamimamsa is the authority. What is Utkrushta (excellent), Anutkrushta (not excellent), Jaghanya (inferior), and Ajaghanya (not inferior) in relation to the Jnanavaraniya Vedana-dravya? || 2 ||

_This is a question-sentence. Accordingly, it asks what is Utkrushta (excellent), Anutkrushta (not excellent), Jaghanya (inferior), and Ajaghanya (not inferior) in relation to the Jnanavaraniya Vedana-dravya. Since the present sentence is a Desamarshak (indicating the subject), it is necessary to also consider nine other questions related to the nine terms: Sadi (with beginning), Anadi (without beginning), Dhruva (permanent), Adhruva (impermanent), Oj (vigor), Yugma (pair), Om (sound), Visishta (distinct), and Nomanovisishta (not distinct).

[Utkrushta (excellent) or Anutkrushta (not excellent) or Jaghanya (inferior) or Ajaghanya (not inferior). || 3 ||]

In response to the above questions, it is said here that the Jnanavaraniya Vedana is, in some way, Utkrushta (excellent), because, in the final stage of Bhavasthiti (state of existence), the Gunitkarmashic (having multiplied karma) Naraki (hell-being) of the seventh Prithvi (earth) possesses this Utkrushta (excellent) dravya. In some way, it is Anutkrushta (not excellent), because, except for the Gunitkarmashic Naraki of the final stage of Karma-sthiti (state of karma), it is found to be Anutkrushta (not excellent) everywhere else. In some way, it is Jaghanya (inferior), because, in the final stage of the Kshina-kshaya (diminished passions) Gunasthan (state of qualities) of the Kshapitkarmashic (having diminished karma) Jiva, this Jaghanya (inferior) dravya is found. In some way, it is also Ajaghanya (not inferior), because, except for the Kshapitkarmashic Jiva, this Ajaghanya (not inferior) dravya is found everywhere else.

Here, the nature of Gunitkaushik and Kshapitkaanshi should be understood as follows:

A being who has existed for 70 Kodakoti Sagaropama, minus two thousand Sagaropama (from the Trasasthitikal) and minus the time of the previous Koti, in the realm of Badar Prithvikayik beings. While residing there, this being has experienced a large number of sufficient births and a small number of insufficient births. It has been born with a long lifespan in the sufficient births and a short lifespan in the insufficient births. It has bound itself to its lifespan through the lowest possible Yogya Jghana in the Ayubandhkal. Its Utkarshana Dravya has been greater than that of Kshapitkaushik, Kshapit-Gholman, and Gunit-Gholman beings, while its Apkarshana Dravya has been less than theirs. It has existed in many excellent Yogasthanas and many Sanklesh Parinamas.

After wandering through the Badar Prithvikayik beings, this being is born in the Badar Trasas Parayapta beings. Even while being born there, it has experienced a large number of sufficient births with a long lifespan and a small number of insufficient births with a short lifespan. Its Utkarshana Dravya has been greater and its Apkarshana Dravya has been less. It has attained many excellent Yogasthanas and many Sanklesh Parinamas there.

After wandering through these beings, it is born in the Narak of the seventh Prithvi in its final Bhavagrahana. There, it becomes Parayapta by completing all the Parayaptis in the shortest possible Antamuhurtkal. During its lifetime, it has attained many excellent Yogasthanas and many Sanklesh Parinamas. While wandering through these beings, it has remained in the Yogyav Madhy for the duration of the Antamuhurtkal, with only a short lifespan remaining. It has attained excellent Sanklesh in the Dwicharman and Tricharman times and excellent Yog in the Charman and Dwicharman times.

This type of being, existing in the final time of the Narak Bhava, is called Gunitkarmaanshi. (This meaning is further explained in Sutras 7 to 32).

A being that has existed for 70 Kodakoti Sagaropama, minus an uncountable fraction of a Palyopama, in the realm of Sukshma Nigod beings. It then leaves that realm and is born in the Badar Prithvikayik beings. It becomes Parayapta by completing all the Parayaptis in the shortest possible time. After that, it dies in the Antarmuhurtkal and is born in the realm of humans with a lifespan of a Koti. It is born after seven months in the womb. It attains Sanayama at the age of eight. It follows Sanayama for a period slightly less than a Koti, and then attains Mithyatva with a short lifespan remaining. It dies with this short-lived Mithyatva and is born in the realm of Devas with a lifespan of ten thousand years. There, it becomes Parayapta by completing all the Parayaptis in the shortest possible time. It attains Samyaktva in the Antarmuhurtkal and follows it for a period slightly less than ten thousand years. It then attains Mithyatva at the end of its lifespan and dies with it. It is born in the Badar Prithvikayik Parayapta beings. It then returns to the Sukshma...

[4, 2, 4, 4] In the **Chakkhandagama**, the **Veyanakhand**

541. A being who, having been born among the **Nigoda** beings, was later born again among the **Badara** **Prithvikayika** beings, and who, while wandering in this way, has been born many times among gods and humans, attaining **Samyama** thirty-two times, has subdued the four **Kshayas** four times each, and has attained **Samyama-Asamyama** and **Samyaktva** only for a fraction of a **Palya-Upam**; such a being, while wandering in this way, is born again in the final existence among humans with an age of **Purva-Koți** measure, and who, having been born after only seven months, has attained **Samyama** at the age of eight years, and who, after maintaining it for a period slightly less than **Purva-Koți** time, is approaching **Kshapana** with the remaining short lifespan, and has reached the final time of the **Chhadmastha** state: such a being should be understood as a **Kshapitakarma-Ashika**. (This meaning is revealed by the original author in the next 40 to 75 sutras)

And the **Sattana** **Karmas** || 4 || In the same way, there is also an examination of the **Vedana**'s excellent beginning stages of the seven **Karmas** || 4 ||

The meaning is that just as the **Jnanavaraniya Karma**'s stages have been examined, so too should the remaining seven **Karmas** be known, because there is no difference in this.

**Samitta** is of two types: **Jghannya-Pada** and **Utkrista-Pada** || 5 ||

In the sutra, '**Pade**' is not the seventh case ending, but the first case ending. Here, due to the order of **Ekar**, the form '**Pade**' has come about. Here, the word '**Pada**' should be understood as a place indicator. The **Samitta** which has a **Jghannya-Pada** is called **Jghannya-Pada**, and the **Samitta** which has an **Utkrista-Pada** is called **Utkrista-Pada**. Or, considering '**Pade**' as the seventh case ending, one **Samitta** in the **Jghannya-Pada** (**Pada-vishayaka**) and another **Samitta** in the **Utkrista-Pada**, in this way, the **Samitta** is of only two types, this meaning should be understood.

Now, while describing the **Utkrista-Pada-vishayaka Samitta**, first, the **Vedana**'s **Samitta** related to **Jnanavaraniya** in relation to **Dravya** is described through twenty-seven (6-32) sutras.

In relation to **Samitta**, the **Utkrista-Pada-vishayaka Jnanavaraniya Vedana**, which is excellent in relation to **Dravya**, is excellent for whom? || 6 ||

The being who has remained for a period of time equal to the excellent state of **Jnanavaraniya** **Karma-Sthiti**, which is slightly less than two thousand **Sagaropama** in the **Badara** **Prithvikayika** beings, among the **Nigoda** beings || 7 ||

[543] Thus, wandering, the Bādar Trasa was born in the Pāryāptaka. || 14 ||
Because the excellent yoga of Trasa is countless times greater than the yoga of the stationary, and because of this, the accumulation of karma is greater, therefore, here, the Bādar Trasa is said to be born in the Pāryāptaka. - There, wandering, he has taken many Pāryāpta Bhavas and few Apāryāpta Bhavas. || 15 ||
There, his Pāryāpta time was long and his Apāryāpta time was short. || 16 || Whenever he binds Āyu, he binds it with the lowest yoga that is suitable for him. || 17 ||
He who performs the excellent act of binding the upper realms and the lowest act of binding the lower realms. || 18 ||
The meaning of this sūtra should be understood as being the same as the previous eleventh sūtra. Many times, he attains the excellent yoga-grounds. || 19 || ... Many times, he is one who has many defilements. || 20 || ... Thus, wandering, in the final Bhava-grahaṇa, he was born in the Naraka of the seventh earth below. || 21 ||
He who, with the same karma-sthiti, has taken the karma-pudgala-skandha here also, with the first-time-occurring Āhāra and the first-time-occurring Tad-bhava-sthiti, by the excellent yoga. || 22 ||
He who has attained growth by excellent growth. || 23 ||

The dr Mahahiyare Veyanadavva Vihane Samittan, within a muhurta, became fully satisfied with all the paryattis. || 24 || There, in the seventh earth, he remained for a period equivalent to thirty-three oceans. || 25 || Having consumed his lifespan, he attained many excellent yogasthanas repeatedly. || 26 || He experienced many intense consequences of karma repeatedly. || 27 || Thus, after wandering and having a little bit of life left, he remained in the yogayavamadhya for a muhurta. || 28 || The yogayavamadhya is the name of the eight-time yogasthanas, which are a fraction of the countless parts of the श्रेणिके. In the ankasandikshti, the arrangement of all the yogasthanas, from the lowest consequence yogasthanas of the dwi-indriya paryattis to the highest consequence yogasthanas of the sanjni panchendriya paryattis, is in the form of a row. The time of these yogasthanas is thicker in the middle (eight times) and thinner on both sides (4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2) in relation to their number. Therefore, the arrangement becomes of that shape. Hence, the eight-time yogasthanas in the middle are designated as 'yavamadhya' in the sutra. He remained there for a muhurta. This is the meaning of this sutra. || 28 ||

He remained in the last jivagunahani sthana antar avali for a fraction of countless parts. || 29 || He attained the highest consequence of karma in the dvicaram and tricaram times. || 30 || It is stated in the sutra that he attained the highest consequence of karma in these two times because it is not possible to remain for a long time with the highest consequence of karma in other times, except these two. || 30 ||

He attained the highest yoga in the charam and dvicaram times. || 31 ||

Since the collection of a lot of dravya is possible only with excellent yoga, therefore it is said in the sutra that the excellent yoga was attained in the ultimate and penultimate time.
Charimsamayatabbhavaththo jado. Tassa charimsamayantabbhavathassa nanavaraniiyaveyanadabado ukkassa.। 32 ॥
_ Thus, the one who has spent the lifespan related to the said bhava, and who is situated in the last time of the naraka bhava, the pain of the dravya of the knowledge-obscuring veyana of that ultimate time-born tadbhava being is excellent.। 32 ॥
Tavyadirittamanukassa.। 33 ॥ There is an inferior dravya pain, different from the above-mentioned excellent pain of the knowledge-obscuring.। 33 ॥
Except for the excellent dravya of the knowledge-obscuring, which was mentioned earlier, all the rest of its dravya is of the nature of inferior pain. For example, if one atom is lost from its excellent dravya due to the force of down-pulling, the remaining dravya will be called inferior. This will be the first alternative of that inferior dravya. In this way, its dravya, which is progressively inferior due to the loss of two, three, etc. atoms, will be called inferior dravya, and it will be the second, third, etc. alternative of the said inferior. In these, the owner of those inferior regions, which are only one time-bound less than the said excellent dravya, is only the kshapitakanshik. Beyond that, the owners of the inferior regions should be understood as the gunitgholman, kshapitgholman, and kshapitkarmaanshik beings.
Evam chhannam kammanamauvavajjanam.। 34 ॥
In the same way, one should know the excellent and inferior pain of the remaining six karmas, except for the ayukarma, in terms of dravya.। 34 ॥
It is important to know here that the mohaniya, which is devoid of the trasasthiti, should be rotated in the badar ekaindriyas, with a measure of forty kodakodisaagaropama, and the name and gotra, which are devoid of the said trasasthiti, should be rotated with a measure of twenty kodakodisaagaropama.
Now, further, the nature of the owner of the excellent dravya pain of the ayukarma is described through 12 sutras.
Samitte na ukkassapade auvavedana davvado ukkassiya kassa?। 35 ।। In terms of ownership, who has the excellent pain of the ayukarma dravya in the excellent position?।
Jo jivo pubbakodauo parabhaviyam puvvakodauam bandhadi jalcharesu dihaa e auvabandhagaddhae tappa aoggasankilesena ukkassajoge bandhadi.। 36 ॥ Ch. 69

546]
In the great cycle of existence, in the state of being subject to karmic consequences, the following is the case:
[4, 2, 4, 39]
A being who, having a lifespan of a koti (a vast number) in the previous existence, binds a lifespan of a koti in the next existence, in the form of an aquatic being, and binds it with the appropriate level of karmic afflictions in the highest state of binding. 

The being whose lifespan is capable of experiencing the highest level of pain due to karma, has three special characteristics. The first characteristic is that its current lifespan should be a koti. The reason for this is that only those who bind a lifespan in the next existence by overcoming three-fourths of a koti in the previous existence are capable of experiencing the highest level of binding. This is not possible for other beings. Therefore, this highest level of binding can only occur in a being whose lifespan is a koti, having overcome three-fourths of a koti in the previous existence.

The second characteristic is that when binding a lifespan in the next existence, it binds the lifespan of an aquatic being, and binds it for a koti. The phrase "in the next existence" in the sutra implies that just as the emergence of other karmas, such as knowledge obscuration, begins in the state of binding after the binding process, the emergence of lifespan karma does not occur in the state of binding, but rather in the next existence. The reason for binding lifespan in aquatic beings is that due to their lack of discrimination, their karmic afflictions are less, and therefore their essence is not depleted as much.

The third characteristic is that it binds the aforementioned lifespan in the next existence with the appropriate level of karmic afflictions in the highest state of binding for a long period of time. This means that while other karmas are bound in the highest state, lifespan karma is not bound with the highest level of karmic afflictions, but rather with a moderate level of karmic afflictions. 

"It remains for a moment in the state of binding above the moderate level." [37]
"In the final state of the destruction of the qualities of the being, it remains for a fraction of an instant in the state of binding." [38]
"Then, gradually receiving time, it is born in aquatic beings with a lifespan of a koti." [39]

After binding a lifespan in the next existence, the current lifespan does not experience a sudden decline, but rather its consequences unfold naturally. To express this, the sutra states "gradually receiving time." Similarly, the bound lifespan does not experience a sudden decline, but rather is born in the next existence. To express this, the sutra states "a lifespan of a koti."

Page #672:
---------------------------
[4, 2, 4, 40] Chakkhandagama Veyanakhand
[547 It is said that 'born in the lifespan'. The meaning of what is said in the sutra 'born in aquatic beings' is that just as a being can be born elsewhere even though it is bound by other karmas such as devagati, etc., it is not possible in the case of lifespan. But the being is definitely born in the lifespan related to the गति which is bound, it is not born elsewhere.
Antomuhutteṇa sabalahuṁ savvahi pajjatīhi pajjatayado || 40 || By the time of the antarmukhurta, it has become sufficient from all the sufficiencies || 40 ||
The antarmukhurta time of the completion of the sufficiencies is both inferior and superior. The term 'sarvalahu' has been taken to negate the superior time. The reason for negating the superior time is that due to the long time, many gopunchas may be lost, which may lead to the depletion of many nisekas, which is not desirable in nature. A being that has become sufficient by the completion of one or two sufficiencies is not eligible for lifespan bondage, but a being that has become sufficient from all the sufficiencies is eligible for lifespan bondage; this is said in the sutra 'it has become sufficient from all the sufficiencies'.
Antomuhutteṇa punaravi parabhaviyaṁ puvvacodaumbandhadi jalacareṣu || 41 ||
By the time of the antarmukhurta, it still binds the lifespan of the previous koti measure related to parbhava in aquatic beings || 41 ||
Since the lifespan bondage time for aquatic beings is longer than that of other lifespan binders, the lifespan of the previous koti measure related to those aquatic beings has been bound again here.
Dīhāe āuabandhagaddhāe tappāoaggaukkassajogena bandhadi || 42 || Within the long lifespan bondage time, it binds that lifespan with the excellent yoga suitable for it || 42 || Jogajavamjjasuvari antomuhuttaddhamaccchido || 43 || It remained until the time of the antarmukhurta above the yoga yavamadhya || 43 || Carim jīvagunahaṇiṭṭhāṇantare āvaliyāe asankhejjadhibhāgamcchido || 44 || It remained until the time of the countless part of the āvali in the last jīvagunahaṇi sthānāntara || 44 || Bahuso bahuso sādaddhāe jutto || 45 || It was united with the sāta time many many times || 45 ||
The name of the time suitable for the bondage of sātavedaniya is sāta time and the name of the time of saṁkleśa suitable for the bondage of asātavedaniya is asāta time. Here, it has been transformed many times in the form of sāta time to negate the many substances that are lost due to dependence.

[The meaning of all this is that the being who was born in the aquatic beings due to the excellent karma that is suitable for him within the time of the excellent life-bond in the three parts of the previous aeon, and who, in the time of the most inferior complete fulfillment, has fulfilled all six fulfillments and then lived for a moment and then, in the same moment, has destroyed all the life that was being consumed in the previous aeon, which is similar to a part of the whole, by the blow of a banana tree, and who, in the same moment of destruction, again begins the bondage of another afterlife-related life-span in the previous aeon related to aquatic beings, and who, within the time of the excellent life-bond, ends the bondage of that life-span in the subsequent time due to the excellent karma that is suitable for him; his life-span is superior in terms of its substance compared to the substance of karma.]

Whenever a bond is formed, it is formed by the excellent yoga that is suitable for it. || 52 ||
The one who makes the lower position the inferior position of the liberation and the higher position the superior position of the liberation. || 53 ||
The meaning is that the destruction of the karma-ashka is much greater due to the destruction of the destroyed-mixed and multiplied-mixed, and its increase is less due to their increase.
Here, in the sutra, the instruction 'bahuso bahuso' should be understood to mean that perhaps, when the inferior yoga-sthana is impossible, one also attains the superior yoga-sthana.
Many times, it attains the inferior yoga-sthana. || 54 ||
Many times, it is associated with the results of slow sanklesha. || 55 ||
Thus, wandering, it is born in the beings of the cloud-earth-bodied. || 56 ||
By the time of the inner moment, in the time of all the small, it has become complete from all the perfections. || 57 ||
The time of the completion of the perfections is not the beginning of time, even the inferior one, but only the inner moment; the word 'antarmuhurta' has been taken in the sutra to make this known.
In the time of the inner moment, the one who has attained death and has been born in the humans of the previous koti. || 58 ||
Since the karma accumulated over a long time can be destroyed by the series of virtues of restraint in humans of the previous koti, therefore, it has been said in the sutra, 'born in humans of the previous koti'.
In the time of all the small, it is born from the birth of coming out of the womb and becomes eight years old. || 59 ||
From the first time of entering the womb, some beings stay in the womb for seven months and then come out, some for eight months, some for nine months, and many beings stay for ten months and then come out of the womb.

**arraeterit arणदव्वविहाणे सामित्तं**

The Sutra states that one should take the vow of non-violence for seven months. The being who has been born from the womb and has reached the age of eight years, from the time of birth to the completion of eight years, is eligible to take the vow of non-violence. Before that, he is not eligible to take the vow of non-violence. This is the meaning of the Sutra.

[551] By the power of the Palidovama's countless divisions, by the power of the countless divisions of the Palidovama, by the time of the countless divisions of the Palidovama, karma was destroyed and arose again, and he was born among the beings of the Badara Prithvikayika. || 70 ||
By the power of the countless divisions of the Palidovama, by the power of the countless divisions of the Palidovama, by the time of the countless divisions of the Palidovama, karma was destroyed and arose again, and he was born among the beings of the Badara Prithvikayika. || 70 ||
Thus, by the attainment of various bhava-grahanas, he observed the eight sanjama-khandakas, subdued the four kshayas, and observed the countless divisions of the Palidovama, the sanjama-asanjama-khandakas, and the samyaktva-khandakas. Thus, in the final bhava-grahana, he was born again among the humans of the Purvakoti age. || 71 ||
Thus, by the attainment of various bhava-grahanas, he observed the eight sanjama-khandakas, subdued the four kshayas, and observed the countless divisions of the Palidovama, the sanjama-asanjama-khandakas, and the samyaktva-khandakas. Thus, in the final bhava-grahana, he was born again among the humans of the Purvakoti age. || 71 ||
The meaning is that when one attains sanjama four times, one sanjama-khandaka is completed. There are a maximum of eight such sanjama-khandakas. The reason is that after this, the being does not remain in the world, he is liberated from the rules. In these sanjama-khandakas, the suppression of kshaya (ascending the upshama-shreni) occurs only four times, it is not possible more than that. In these many sanjama-khandakas, the being observes the sanjama-asanjama-khandakas for a maximum of countless divisions of the Palidovama, and he observes the samyaktva-khandakas even more than that.
He was born from the birth of the yoni-niष्क्रमण in the time of the Sarvalahu (seven months). || 72 ||
He attained sanjama at that time. || 73 ||
There, by observing sanjama until the bhava-sthiti of the Purvakoti, when there was a little left of the lifespan, he became eager in kshapana. || 74 ||

**Greatly Venerable, the nature of the annihilation of the karmas**

[4, 2, 4, 81 The last moment of the subtle state is attained. The pain of the knowledge-obscuring karma of that last moment of the subtle state is less than the pain of the substance. || 75 ||
'552]
The last moment of the subtle state refers to the attainment of the last moment of the subtle state of the subtle karma. The reason is that the word 'subtle' refers to the covering, and the one who resides in that covering is the subtle state; this is the etymological meaning of the word 'subtle state'.
It is less than the substance. || 76 ||
All the pain of the knowledge-obscuring karma, other than this less one, is said to be not less than the substance. || 76 ||
Similarly, the pain of the perception-obscuring karma, the delusion-producing karma, and the hindering karma should also be known to be less than the substance. The difference is that when a being who is engaged in the annihilation of the delusion-producing karma attains the last moment of the subtle state of the subtle karma, the pain of the delusion-producing karma is less than the pain of the substance of that last moment of the subtle state. || 77 ||
It is not less than that. || 78 ||
The pain of the substance of the aforementioned three karmas, other than this, should be known to be not less than the substance. || 78 ||
It should be understood that all the possibilities of the substance, which increase in the order of the atoms above the less substance, are included in this not less than the substance pain.
Now, in the next 30 (79-108) sutras, the nature of the owner of the less than the substance pain of the karmas that are to be experienced is described.
In the less than the substance state, whose pain is less than the substance of the karmas that are to be experienced? || 79 ||
Whose pain is less than the substance in the less than the substance state? || 79 ||
The being who has remained in the state of karma with a karma-state measure less than an innumerable part of the palyopama in the subtle nigoda beings. || 80 ||
In them, the one who is wandering around has a few non-perfect births and a few perfect births. || 81 ||

In the Chakkhandagama, the second chapter...  The long-lived are those who have a long period of *aparyapta* and a short period of *paryapta*. || 82 ||
It is said that the one whose *aparyapta* period is long and *paryapta* period is short. || 82 ||
Whenever he binds the lifespan, he binds it with the *tatprayogya* excellent *yoga*. || 83 ||
He who makes the inferior stage of *niseya* for the upper positions and the excellent stage of *niseya* for the lower positions. || 84 ||
Very often he attains the inferior *yogasthanas*. || 85 ||
Very often he is associated with the slow *sanklesha* results. || 86 ||
Thus, having wandered in the cycle of existence, he is born among the *paryapta* beings of the *badara* earth. || 87 ||
He who has become *paryapta* from all *paryaptis* in the shortest possible time, the *antarmuhurta*. || 88 ||
He who, in the *antarmuhurta*, having attained death, is born among the humans of the previous *koti* lifespan. || 89 ||
He who, in the shortest possible time, is born from the birth of *yoninishkramana* and becomes eight years old. || 90 ||
He who, after that time, has attained *sanjama*. || 91 ||
There, he who, having observed *sanjama* only up to the previous *koti* of existence, has gone to *michchhatva* when there is a little remaining of life, is mistaken. || 92 ||
He who, having attained *michchhatva*, has remained for a short time in that *michchhatva* related *asanjama* period. || 93 ||

With *mithyatva* (false belief) he attained death and was born among the gods with a lifespan of ten thousand years. || 94 ||
There, in the *antarmukhuta* (inner moment), in the *sarvalahu* (shortest) time, he became fulfilled by all *parijatti* (perfections). || 95 ||
Thus, becoming fulfilled, he attained *samyaktva* (right belief) in the *antarmukhuta*. || 96 ||
There, for a little less than ten thousand years, he maintained *samyaktva* and then, with a little remaining of his lifespan, he attained *mithyatva*. || 97 ||
With *mithyatva* he attained death and was born among the *badara* (earth-bodied) *prithvijayika* (earth-dwelling) *parijatti* (perfected) beings. || 98 ||
There, in the *antarmukhuta*, in the *sarvalahu* (shortest) time, he became fulfilled by all *parijatti* (perfections). || 99 ||
There, in the *antarmukhuta*, he attained death and was born among the *suhumani* (subtle) *nigoda* (subtle) *parijatti* (perfected) beings. || 100 ||
For an *asankhyeya* (innumerable) part of a *palyopam* (moment), he was struck by *dvidikhandayaghada* (two-part destruction) and, for an *asankhyeya* part of a *palyopam* (moment), he was born again among the *badara* (earth-bodied) *prithvijayika* (earth-dwelling) *parijatti* (perfected) beings, having destroyed his karma by *hatasampatti* (destruction of karma). || 101 ||
Thus, in various *bhavagrahana* (births), he maintained the eight *sanjamakandaya* (restraints), subdued the four *kṣaya* (passions), and maintained the *sanjamakandaya* (restraints), *asanjamakandaya* (non-restraints), and *samyaktva* (right belief) for an *asankhyeya* part of a *palyopam* (moment). Thus, he wandered in *samsara* (cycle of birth and death) and, in the last *bhavagrahana* (birth), he was born again among the *punakodaya* (reborn) humans. || 102 ||

[555] By practicing the infinite parts of the Upashama Kara and the Palyopamake, the Asankhyata, the Samyama-Samyama-Kandakas, and the Samyaktva-Kandakas; thus, by wandering around, in the final Bhavagrahana, again, the one who has been born among the humans with the previous Koti lifespan. || 102 ||
The one who has been born in the shortest time, through the Yoni-Nishkramana form of birth, is eight years old. || 103 || The one who has attained Samyama at the age of eight. || 104 || The one who has become eager for Kshapana in the last Muhurta, after attaining Samyama. || 105 || The one who has become a Kevali, by generating the Kevalajnana and Kevaladarshana in the last Muhurta. || 106 ||
There, the one who has lived as a Kevali for a short time, after giving up the previous Koti lifespan, and has become a Charimasamaya-Bhavya-Siddhi, with a little bit of life remaining. || 107 ||
The Vedaniya of that Charimasamaya-Bhavya-Siddhi is less severe in terms of the Vedaniya-Dravya. || 108 || The severity of the above-mentioned Vedaniya is less severe in terms of the Vedaniya-Dravya. || 109 || Similarly, the Nama and Gotra Karmas. || 110 ||
Just as the severity and non-severity of the Vedaniya Karma has been described in terms of the Dravya, similarly, the Nama and Gotra Karmas should also be described; because, there is no difference in that.
In terms of ownership, in the less severe state, whose Ayukarma Vedana is less severe in terms of the Dravya? || 111 ||

A being with a lifespan of a *purvakoti* (previous aeon) binds its lifespan in the hells of the seventh earth through a short *ayubandhak* (lifespan-binding) period. [112]
A being with a lifespan of a *purvakoti* binds its lifespan in the seventh earth, and through *avalambanakaran* (dependence-making), it destroys many substances of the *ayukarma* (lifespan karma). Therefore, a being with a lifespan of a *purvakoti* is taken here. *Avalambanakaran* is the name for falling down due to the destruction of the upper substances of the *ayukarma* related to the future life.
It binds through the *jghannyayoga* (inferior yoga) of *tappāoggajhaṇṇaeṇa* (being in the state of being burnt). [113]
It has remained for an *antarmuhurt* (inner moment) in the middle of the *yogayava* (yoga-limb). [114]
It has remained for an innumerable part of an *avali* (a period of time) in the first *jivagunahanisthānantar* (after the state of the loss of the qualities of the soul). [115]
Then, gradually, it has been born in the hells of the seventh earth, having obtained death. [116]
One who has bound the lifespan related to the future life does not perform *kadali ghat* (destruction of the lifespan), this is the rule. Therefore, one should understand the meaning of the sutra as follows: one who has been born in the hells without destroying the lifespan of the future life by performing *avalambanakaran* for less than three parts of a *purvakoti* and by performing *apavartana ghat* (destruction of the lifespan).
It has taken food through the *jghanny upapad yoga* (inferior birth yoga) of the *padamasamayahar* (first-time food) and the *padamasamayatabbhavattha* (first-time being). [117]
It has grown through *jghannyavaddhi* (inferior growth). [118]
It has become sufficient through *paryattis* (sufficient) for an *antarmuhurt* (inner moment) and for a very long time. [119]
In the time of sufficiency, the destruction of the lifespan is much less than in the time of insufficiency through the inferior yoga. Therefore, the length of the time of insufficiency is indicated in the present sutra.

There, the lifespan up to the thirty-third ocean-like measure, is sustained by the soul, being repeatedly associated with the state of Asata (Asatavedaniya, the state of bondage). || 120 ||
When the lifespan is reduced to a mere remnant, the soul, bound by the future lifespan, experiences the pain of the karmic action of lifespan, which is less severe than the pain of the material substance. || 121 ||
This pain of the material substance is less severe. || 122 ||
The pain of the material substance, which is like the flame of a lamp, increases progressively with the number of atoms, should be understood as distinct from the pain of the non-material substance.
Now, here are three categories of Anuyogin doors: the Jghana (lesser) door, the Utkrushta (greater) door, and the Jghana-Utkrushta (lesser-greater) door. || 123 ||
The lesser pain of the eight karmas, in relation to the material substance, is called the Jghana door. The greater pain of the eight karmas, in relation to the material substance, is called the Utkrushta door. The pain of the eight karmas, in relation to both the material and non-material substances, is called the Jghana-Utkrushta door.
The pain of the karmic action of lifespan, in relation to the Jghana door, is the least severe of all. || 124 ||
The pain of the karmic action of name and lineage, in relation to the material substance, is equal to the pain of the karmic action of lifespan, but is countless times greater. || 125 ||
The pain of the karmic actions of knowledge-obscuring, perception-obscuring, and hindrance, in relation to the material substance, are equal to each other, but are greater than the pain of the karmic action of name and lineage. || 126 ||
The pain of the karmic action of delusion, in relation to the material substance, is even greater. || 127 ||

The multiplier of each yogasthāna is an innumerable part of the palya-upamā. [173]
Thus, by calling the yogasthāna as alpa-bahutva, the next sūtra informs about the alpa-bahutva of the karma-pradeśa.
_ The alpa-bahutva of the pradeśa should be described in the same way as the alpa-bahutva of the yoga. However, instead of yoga, the word "pradeśa" should be used here. [174]
In the description of the yogasthāna, these ten anuyoga-dvāra are to be known. [175]
Here, among the many types of yoga, the upādāna-yoga, ekānta-anuvṛddhi-yoga, and parināma-yoga, which are the types of juñjaṇa-yoga, should be included under the noāgama-bhāva-yoga. This is because the karma-pradeśa does not come from any other yoga except these.
The avibhāga-pratiścheda-prūpaṇā, vargaṇa-prūpaṇā, spardhaka-prūpaṇā, antara-prūpaṇā, sthāna-prūpaṇā, anantaro-panidhā, paramparo-panidhā, samaya-prūpaṇā, vṛddhi-prūpaṇā, and alpa-bahutva; these are the ten anuyoga-dvāra mentioned above. [176]
According to the avibhāga-pratiścheda-prūpaṇā, how many yoga-vibhāga-pratiścheda are there for each jīva-pradeśa? [177]
There are innumerable loka-pramaṇa yoga-vibhāga-pratiścheda for each jīva-pradeśa. [178]
The avibhāga-pratiścheda is the one part obtained by dividing the lowest yoga situated on one jīva-pradeśa by innumerable lokas. It should be understood that according to this avibhāga-pratiścheda, there are innumerable loka-mātra yoga-vibhāga-pratiścheda on each jīva-pradeśa.
There are only so many yoga-vibhāga-pratiścheda on each jīva-pradeśa. [179]

According to the Vargṇaparūvaṇā, there is a Vargṇā of countless Lokas, which is the division of the Yogāvibhāgapratichchedas. || 180 ||
Thus, there are countless Vargṇās in the countless divisions of the Śreṇi. || 181 ||
The name of a group of Jivas whose Yogāvibhāgapratichchedas are equal in number to the Yogāvibhāgapratichchedas of a particular Jiva-pradeśa is called a Vargṇā. Further, the name of a group of Jivas whose Yogāvibhāgapratichchedas are equal to each other, but greater than the Yogāvibhāgapratichchedas of the Jiva-pradeśas of the previous Vargṇā, and less than the Yogāvibhāgapratichchedas of each Jiva-pradeśa of the subsequent Vargṇās, is called the second Vargṇā. All the Vargṇās obtained by this method are countless in number, equal to the countless divisions of the Śreṇi.
According to the Fadayaparūvaṇā, there is a Fadaya of countless Vargṇās, which are countless in number, equal to the countless divisions of the Śreṇi. || 182 ||
The name of each Jiva-pradeśa where the same number of Javana Yogas are found in the Avibhāgapratichchedas is called a Varg, and the name of the group of these is called the first Vargṇā. Further, the name of the group of all the Jiva-pradeśas which have one more Avibhāgapratichchedas than the Avibhāgapratichchedas of the previous Varg is called the second Vargṇā. In this way, the groups of Jiva-pradeśas with increasing Yogāvibhāgapratichchedas, one Avibhāgapratichchedas at a time, are called the third, fourth, etc. Vargṇās. These Vargṇās are countless in number, equal to the countless divisions of the Jagśreṇi, in one Fadaya. || 182 ||
Thus, there are countless Fadayas in one Yogasthāna, equal to the countless divisions of the Śreṇi. || 183 ||
According to the Antaraparūvaṇā, what is the difference between two Fadayas? The difference is countless Lokas. || 184 ||
When the first Fadaya increases by the amount of the first Fadaya, it becomes the second Fadaya. The reason for this is that the first Varg of the first Fadaya is twice the number of the first Varg of the second Fadaya, in terms of the Vibhāgapratichchedas.

The difference between all the Fadayas is the same. || 185 ||

[565] There are many types of increase and decrease in the yogasthanas, which are innumerable. || 196 ||
According to the time-based classification, the four yogasthanas with different time durations are innumerable. || 197 ||
The yogasthanas with five time durations are also innumerable. || 198 ||
Similarly, the yogasthanas with six, seven, and eight time durations are also innumerable. || 199 ||
Furthermore, the yogasthanas with seven, six, five, four, three, and two time durations are also innumerable. || 200 ||
According to the increase-based classification, there are innumerable increase and decrease in the yogasthanas, countable increase and decrease, countable multiplication increase and decrease, and innumerable multiplication increase and decrease. || 201 ||
How long do the three increases and three decreases last? The shortest duration is one time. || 202 ||
The longest duration is an innumerable fraction of an avali. || 203 ||
How long do the innumerable multiplication increase and decrease last? The shortest duration is one time. || 204 ||
The longest duration is an antarmuhurta. || 205 ||
According to the principle of alpabahutva, the eight-time yogasthanas are the most scarce. || 206 ||

**The field is of many types due to the difference in the establishment of names, etc. Here, the Lokakasha is the nature of the Noaagamadravyaakshetrasvaroop. According to the Nirukti, 'Lokyante Jivaadayah Padarthaah Yasmin Asau Lokah', where the Jivaadika substances are seen - found - is called Lokakasha. The name of the eight types of Karmadravya is Karmavedana. The field of this Karmavedana is called Karmavedanaakshetra. Since the form of this Karmavedana field has been described in the Prakrit Anuyogadvaar, therefore, this Anuyogadvaar is called Vedanaakshetravidhana. In it, these three Anuyogadvaar are to be known.**

**Since the consideration of the excellent - non-excellent positions of the field related to Karmavedana has been done in the Prakrit Padmimaansa Anuyogadvaar, therefore, its 'Padmimaansa' is a meaningful name. While considering these positions, it has been asked here in the first place about the field related to Jnanavaran Karmavedana, that what is the Vedana of Jnanavaraaniy, what is inferior, and what is not inferior.**

Is Prichchaka Uttar Aage Ke Sutra Dwara Diya Jaata Hai

**The answer to this question is given by the next Sutra.**

**What is not excellent in the four positions of excellent, etc.?**

[568]
**Field of Pain, Field of Karma, and the Doctrine of Degrees**
[4, 2, 5, 6]
Whether it is excellent or not excellent, whether it is inferior or not inferior. ||4||
Its excellent field of pain is found in the great fish that receives a fatal blow in a field of only eight rajus. Except for this fish, it is not excellent. Its inferior field of pain is found in the subtle nigoda jiva that has three simultaneous food-bodies and three simultaneous derivative states. Except for this, it is not inferior.
Thus, of the seven karmas. ||5||
Just as the degrees of the field of pain for the knowledge-obscuring karma have been considered here, so also should the degrees of the field of pain for the remaining seven karmas be considered. ||5||
Ownership is of two kinds: inferior and excellent. ||6||
Generally, there are four kinds of inferiority, based on the difference in the establishment of names, etc. Among these, there are two kinds of material inferiority: material inferiority due to influx and material inferiority not due to influx. Among these, there are three kinds of material inferiority not due to influx, based on the difference in the knowing body, etc. Among these, there are two kinds of material inferiority not due to influx, other than that which is specific to the individual: inferiority due to influx and inferiority due to command. Among these, there are four kinds of inferiority due to influx, based on the difference in material, field, time, and state. In terms of material, the inferior is one atom. In terms of field, the inferior is of two kinds: inferior field of karma and inferior field not of karma. Among these, the inferior immersion of the subtle nigoda jiva should be known as the inferior field of karma, and one region of space should be known as the inferior field not of karma. In terms of time, the inferior is considered to be one moment. The indivisible part of the smoothness, etc., that resides in the atom should be known as the inferior state.
In terms of the above material, field, etc., there are also four kinds of inferiority due to command. In terms of material, inferiority due to command is like this: a two-regioned skandha in relation to a three-regioned skandha, and a three-regioned skandha in relation to a four-regioned skandha, etc. In terms of field, a material that has immersed in two regions of space is considered inferior to a material that has immersed in three regions of space. In the same way, one should imagine this inferiority due to command in the field in relation to the remaining regions. In terms of time, a material that has undergone two moments of transformation, etc., is inferior to a material that has undergone three moments of transformation, etc. In the same way, in terms of state, a material that has undergone transformation from two primary qualities (parts), etc., should be known as inferior to a material that has undergone transformation from three primary qualities (parts), etc. In all of these, the case of inferiority due to influx is found.
_Just as the nature of these divisions and subdivisions of inferiority has been stated here, so also should one know the nature of these divisions and subdivisions of excellence, as far as possible._

[569] In this way, having finished the Padmimamsa, now the dependent representation of ownership is done further.
Samittana ukkassapada nanavaraniiya veyana khettado ukkassiya kassa? ||7||
Whose is the superior field of the pain of the knowledge-obscuring, in relation to the ownership right? ||7||
Jo maccho joyanasahassiyo sambhuramanasamudassa baharillae tadde acchido ||8||
The fish who is a thousand yojanas deep, is situated on the outer shore of the Sambhuramana ocean. ||8||
Here, from the outer shore of the Sambhuramana ocean, one should take the land area on the other side of the ocean, not the outer platform which is its part; because, there is no possibility of contact with the Tanuvatavala, which is mentioned in the next sutra (9).
Veyanasamugdhaden samuhdo ||9|| Who has attained the state of being agitated by the pain-agitation. ||9||
The state of the being's area, which expands three times in width and height, due to being under the control of pain, is called pain-agitation. Although it is not a rule that everyone's soul-area expands three times in this pain-agitation, because, according to the appropriate pain, an increase of one, two, or more areas is also possible; but, due to the ownership of the superior field, such pain-agitations are not intended here, this should be understood as the meaning of this sutra.
Kayalessyae laggo ||10|| Who is attached to the Kakaleshya. ||10||
The meaning of Kakaleshya is Tanuvatavala. The reason is that its color is like a crow (kak). The meaning is that the great fish, which was lifted from the Sambhuramana ocean by a former enemy god and thrown near the Lokanali on its outer part, and which, being overwhelmed by intense pain there, has become transformed by pain-agitation and is connected to the Tanuvatavala, is attached to the outer part of the Lokanali with its soul-areas.
Punaravimaranantiyasamugdhaden samuhdo tinni viggahakandayani kadun ||11||
Yet, who has attained the state of being agitated by the death-agitation, having done three Vigrahakandakas. ||11||
The meaning of Vigraha is crookedness or bend. And the meaning of Kandaka is straight motion like an arrow. The meaning is that the great fish, having attained the death-agitation after pain-agitation there,

[570]
The Veeyana Mahahiyaara has three Kaandakas with two Vigrahas (Mondas) in the Veeyana Khatta Vihaana, which are as follows: [4, 2, 5, 19]. The three Kaandakas should be known as follows: The Lokanaali came from the Vayavya direction with a straight motion like an arrow, towards the south for a distance of half a Raju. This is the first Kaandaka. Then, turning from there, it again moved in a straight line like an arrow towards the east for a distance of one Raju. This is the second Kaandaka. After that, turning from there, it again moved downwards in a straight line for a distance of six Rajus. This is the third Kaandaka. Thus, the one who has attained the Maaranantika Samudghaat by performing these three Vigraha Kaandakas.

From there, in the future, he will be born in the seventh earth below. The pain of the knowledge-obscuring Veeyana field of that Mahamatsya is superior to that of the one who has attained the Maaranantika Samudghaat. || 12 ||

Thus, the pain of the knowledge-obscuring karma of the Mahamatsya is inferior to the above-mentioned superior field. || 13 ||

Similarly, the superior and inferior pain fields of Darshanavaraaniy, Mohaniy, and Antaraaya should also be described. || 14 ||

The Padmimaansa is complete.

In the Samitta, in the word "Ukkassa", whose pain field of the Veedaniy karma is superior to that of the one who has attained the Maaranantika Samudghaat? || 15 ||

The pain field of the Veedaniy karma of the Kevali who has attained the Kevali Samudghaat and has attained the Lokapurana state is superior to that of the other Kevali. || 16 ||

The word "Anyatar" used in the Sutra should be understood as prohibiting the differences in understanding and the special fields like Bhartaadi.

Thus, the pain field of the Veedaniy karma of the Mahamatsya is inferior to the above-mentioned superior field. || 17 ||

Similarly, the superior and inferior pain fields of Aayu, Naama, and Gothra karma should also be described. || 18 ||

In the Samitta, in the word "Jahaan", whose pain field of the knowledge-obscuring Veeyana karma is inferior to that of the one who has attained the Maaranantika Samudghaat? || 19 ||

Page #696:
---------------------------
[4, 2, 5, 20] Chakkhandagama Veyanakhandam
[571] In the context of ownership, whose pain field is expected for the most inferior knowledge-obscuring karma? || 19 ||
The pain field of the knowledge-obscuring karma for a subtle Nigoda, who is a recipient of three-time food, is a Tadbhav, and is present in the third time of that Bhav, is a Jghana Yogi, and is present in the most inferior immersion of the body, is inferior to the pain field of the knowledge-obscuring karma of another subtle Nigoda, who is a recipient of three-time food, is a Tadbhav, and is present in the third time of that Bhav. || 20 ||
The pain of the said knowledge-obscuring karma is different from the above. || 21 ||
In the same way, the pain fields of the remaining seven karmas should be described as inferior and superior. || 22 ||
There are three Anuyo-gadwaras in this: Jghana Pada, Utkrushta Pada, and Jghana-Utkrushta Pada. || 23 ||
In the Jghana Pada, the pain fields of all eight karmas are equal. || 24 ||
This is because the inferior pain field of all eight karmas is present in the third time of that Bhav, for a subtle Nigoda, who is a recipient of three-time food, is a Tadbhav, and is present in the third time of that Bhav.
In the Utkrushta Pada, the pain fields of the knowledge-obscuring, perception-obscuring, delusion-inducing, and obstruction karmas are superior to the field, and all four are equal and small. || 25 ||
The pain fields of the karmas of the name, body, and birth are superior to the field, and all four are equal and countless. || 26 ||

The excellent Avagahanā of the Bādar Vanaspathikāyika Prati-śarīra Nirvṛtti-paryāptak is multiplied by the number. || 93 ||
The excellent Avagahanā of the Pancha-Indriya Nirvṛtti-paryāptak is multiplied by the number. || 94 ||
Now, here in the Prakṛti Alp-bahutva, where the number-multiplied and the innumerable-multiplied forms are said to be multipliers, where and how much is intended, in this way, its proof is presented.
The multiplier of the Avagahanā of one Sūkṣma Jīva to the Avagahanā of another Sūkṣma Jīva is the innumerable part of the Āvali. || 95 ||
The multiplier of the Avagahanā of a Sūkṣma Jīva to the Avagahanā of a Bādar Jīva is the innumerable part of the Palyopam. || 96 ||
The multiplier of the Avagahanā of a Bādar Jīva to the Avagahanā of a Sūkṣma is the innumerable part of the Āvali. || 97 ||
The multiplier of the Avagahanā of one Bādar to the Avagahanā of another Bādar is the innumerable part of the Palyopam. || 98 ||
Those who have the rise of the Bādar Nāmakarma are called Bādar. In this way, from this characteristic, here, one should understand the inclusion of the Dvī-Indriya etc. Jīvas connected with that Bādar Nāmakarma. Where the Avagahanā of one Bādar Jīva is said to be innumerable times that of another Bādar Jīva, there, one should understand the innumerable part of the Palyopam from the innumerable. Ch. 73

Here, time is of seven types, differentiated by name-time, establishment-time, substance-time, conduct-time, half-time, evidence-time, and feeling-time. In these, the word 'time' is name-time. The understanding that 'this is time', which is attributed to other substances by intellect, is called establishment-time.

Substance-time is of two types, differentiated by Agam substance-time and Noagam substance-time. In these, the time that is known to the soul from the beginning, but is devoid of use in the present, is Agam substance-time. Noagam substance-time is of three types, differentiated by knowing-body Noagam substance-time, future Noagam substance-time, and other than that Noagam substance-time. In these, other than that Noagam substance-time is of two types, differentiated by principal and non-principal. In these, the time substance that is the measure of the regions (innumerable) of the world-space is the principal substance-time. It is devoid of a group of regions like a heap of jewels, being formless and without beginning or end, being the cause of the transformation of the remaining five substances. Non-principal substance-time is of three types, differentiated by sentient, non-sentient, and mixed. In these, bite-time, mosquito-time, etc. are sentient time. Dust-time, mud-time, hot-time, rain-time, and cold-time, etc. are non-sentient time. Cold-time, etc. that is present with dances is called mixed time.

Conduct-time is of two types, differentiated by worldly and transcendental. In these, the time of ploughing (cultivating) and sowing seeds, etc. is considered worldly conduct-time. Worship-time, rule-time, self-study-time, and meditation-time, etc. should be known as transcendental time. Half-time is of three types, differentiated by past, future, and present. Time like a moment, like an ocean, like an ascending and descending, etc. is evidence-time, which is of many types.

**Veeyana Mahahiyar Veeyana Kaal Vihaane Aniyogaddarani Deso**
[4, 2, 6, 8]

**The Veeyana Mahahiyar Veeyana Kaal Vihaane Aniyogaddarani Deso**

There are two types of Bhaavakaal, Aagam and Noaagam. The one which is aware of the Kaalpaabhoot and is used in the present is called Aagam Bhaavakaal. The five Bhaavas, Audayik etc., should be understood as Noaagam Bhaavakaal. In all these Kaal Bhedas, Pramaan Kaal is the main one. Since this Aniyogaddar explains the Kaal related to Veedna, it should be known as "Kaal Viddhaan".

**Padmeemansa Samittmappabahue Tti** ||2||

The three Aniyogaddars that should be known are: Padmeemansa, Swaamitva and Alpbahutva Aniyogaddars.

**Padmeemansaaye Naanavaraaniyaveeyana Kaalado Kimukkasssa Kimanukkasssa Kim Jahanna Kim ajahanna?** ||3||

With respect to the Padmeemansa Adhikaar, what is superior, inferior, inferior, and superior in terms of the Veedna Kaal of the Naanavaraaniy Karma? ||3||

**Ukkassa Va Anukkasssa Va Jahanna Va Ajahanna Va** ||4||

With respect to the Naanavaraaniy Veedna Kaal, it is superior, inferior, inferior, and superior. ||4||

**Evam Sattanna Kammaan** ||5||

Similarly, the superior and inferior positions of the remaining seven Karmas should be understood. ||5||

**Samittan Duvihan Jahannapade Ukkassapade** ||6||

Swaamitva is of two types: related to the inferior position and related to the superior position. ||6||

**Saamineen Ukkassapade Naanavaraaniyaveeyana Kaalado Ukkassiya Kassa?** ||7||

With respect to Swaamitva, who is superior to the Naanavaraaniyaveeyana Kaal related to the superior position? ||7||

**Annadarassa Panchindriyassa Sanniassa Micchaaidvisssa Savvaahhipajjattihi Pajjattayadassa Kammabhoomiyassa Akammabhoomiyassa Va Kammabhoomipadhibhaagassa Va Sankhejjavasaauassa Va Asankhejjavasaauassa Va Devassa Va Manusssassa Va Tirikhassa Va Neraiyassa Va Isthivedassa Va Purisavedassa Va Naunsayavedassa Va Jalcharassa Va Thalcharassa Va Khagacharassa Va Saagaarajagaar-Sudovajogajuttaassa Ukkassiyaae Dvidiye Ukkassahidisankilesse Vattmaanassa, Adhava Eesimajjhimparinaamassa Tassa Naanavaraaniyaveeyana Kaalado Ukkassa** ||8||

The one who is Panchindriy, Sanjni, Micchaaidvissi, has all the Pajjattis, is a Kammabhoomi, Akammabhoomi, or Kammabhoomipadhibhaago, has a Sankhejjavasaau or Asankhejjavasaau, is a Dev, Manussa, Tirikha, Neraiya, Isthiveda, Purisaved, Naunsayaved, Jalchar, Thalchar, Khagachar, or has Saagaarajagaar-Sudovajogajutta, is superior to the Naanavaraaniyaveeyana Kaal of the one who is in the Dvidiye Ukkassahidisankilesse Vattmaanassa, or is in the Eesimajjhimparinaamassa. ||8||

years old; is a god, human, animal, or hell being; is associated with any of the three Vedas: female, male, or neuter; is an aquatic, terrestrial, or aerial being; has a physical body, is awake, has knowledge, is in a state of bondage to the highest state of knowledge, or has some medium state of bondage; the pain of the knowledge-obscuring karma is greater than the time of its bondage. || 8 || The word 'any other' used in the sutra should be understood as negating the characteristics of understanding, etc. Since beings other than those with false vision do not bind the highest state of knowledge, etc., they are negated by the term 'false vision'. Even among those with false vision, only those who have attained the state of being fully satisfied with all the satisfactions bind the highest state, those who are not fully satisfied do not bind it; this is stated here as 'fully satisfied with all the satisfactions' to make this distinction clear. There are two types of five-sense beings: those who are in the realm of karma and those who are not; among them, only those who are conscious and fully satisfied, born in the fifteen realms of karma, bind the highest state, those born in the realms of enjoyment (not in the realm of karma) do not bind the highest state; the term 'realm of karma' is used here to indicate this. The term 'not in the realm of karma' used in the above sutra should be understood as referring to gods and hell beings, and 'participation in the realm of karma' should be understood as referring to beings born in the outer part of the self-luminous mountain. Since beings with knowledge do not bind the highest state of knowledge, the sutra says 'with a physical body'. Similarly, since the highest state is not bound in the state of sleep, the term 'awake' is used to indicate the state of being awake. The term 'with knowledge' should be understood as negating the knowledge of the mind. Thus, only those beings who have these characteristics bind the highest state of the knowledge-obscuring karma, therefore, the pain of the knowledge-obscuring karma is greater than the time of its bondage, this is the meaning of this sutra.
Other than that, the pain is less than the time of the knowledge-obscuring karma. || 9 || The bondage of the highest state of the knowledge-obscuring karma is equal to thirty kodi sagar, a vast amount. The various states of bondage, one or two times less than that, and three times less, etc., should be understood as less than the highest state. And the six karmas. || 10 ||
Similarly, the highest ownership of the time of pain related to the remaining six karmas should be understood as a model. || 10 ||
In terms of ownership, whose pain of the life karma is greater than the time of its bondage? || 11 ||
Less time,

Whether a human or a five-sensed being, whether a right-seeing or [a wrong-seeing], whether fully endowed with all the perfections, whether born in a karma-bhumi or a karma-bhumi-pratibhaga, whether having a lifespan of a countable number of years, whether belonging to the female, male, or neuter gender, whether a water-dwelling or land-dwelling being, whether associated with a physical form, whether awake, whether associated with the defilement of the relevant karma [or with its purification], and whether having a superior affliction, the pain of the karma of lifespan is superior to the time of the binding of the lifespan of the gods and hell-beings at the first time of binding. || 12 ||

The term "any other" used in the sutra indicates the absence of any specific characteristics such as lineage, family, caste, or varna. Humans bind the superior lifespan of the gods, and humans and five-sensed beings bind the superior lifespan of the hell-beings. To express this meaning, the sutra uses the terms "human" and "five-sensed being." Right-seeing beings bind the superior lifespan of the gods, and wrong-seeing beings bind the superior lifespan of the hell-beings. To show this, the sutra instructs "right-seeing" and "wrong-seeing." The superior lifespan of the gods is bound by humans currently existing in the fifteen karma-bhumi, but the superior lifespan of the hell-beings is bound by beings currently existing in the fifteen karma-bhumi as well as in the karma-bhumi-pratibhaga. This meaning is conveyed by the terms "born in a karma-bhumi" and "born in a karma-bhumi-pratibhaga." By "having a lifespan of a countable number of years," it should be understood that only those with a lifespan of a countable number of years bind the superior lifespan of the gods and hell-beings, not those with an uncountable lifespan. The superior lifespan of the gods is bound only by land-dwelling restrained humans, but the superior lifespan of the hell-beings is bound by land-dwelling humans, wrong-seeing beings, as well as water-dwelling and land-dwelling five-sensed beings who are wrong-seeing. To express this meaning, the sutra states "water-dwelling and land-dwelling." Just as the superior state of the remaining karmas, such as knowledge-obscuration, is bound with superior defilement, the superior state of the karma of lifespan is not bound by superior defilement or superior purification. To convey this meaning, the sutra instructs "associated with the defilement of the relevant karma" and "associated with its purification." Since this superior state of lifespan is not bound without superior affliction, it is stated here "having a superior affliction." Since this superior affliction does not occur in the second or subsequent times, ...

Here, in this sūtra, it is said that the pain of the excellent lifespan occurs at the very first time of bondage of the living being who binds the excellent lifespan by obstructing the three parts of the previous koṭi, and thus binds the excellent lifespan of gods and hell beings.
Tavadirittamaṇukkasā || 13 || There is an inferior pain of the lifespan karma, different from that excellent pain. || 13 ||
There are countless owners of this inferior temporal pain. For example, one who has bound a lifespan of thirty-three oceans worth by obstructing the three parts of the previous koṭi is the owner of the excellent temporal pain of that lifespan, but one who has bound it for less than one time is the owner of its inferior temporal pain. Similarly, those who bind the said lifespan for two times less, three times less, and so on, successively one time less, will all be the owners of its inferior temporal pain. This is the meaning of this sūtra.
Sāmittena Jahaṇṇapade Ṇāṇāvaraṇīyavedanā Kālado Jahaṇiyā Kassā? || 14 ||
Whose is the pain of the knowledge-obscuring karma, which is inferior in relation to time, in the context of ownership, in the inferior position? || 14 ||
Aṇṇadarassa Carimasamaya Chāduṁmatthassa Tassa Ṇāṇāvaraṇīyaveyaṇā Kālado Jahaṇṇā ||
The pain of the knowledge-obscuring karma of any living being who is in the last time of the veiled state is inferior in relation to time. || 15 ||
The reason for this is that in the last time of the veiled state, the state of that knowledge-obscuring karma remains for only one time.
Tavadirittamajahaṇṇā || 16 || There is a pain, which is not inferior in relation to time, different from this inferior pain. || 16 ||
The owners of this non-inferior temporal pain should be understood as those who are in the last time, with subtle passions, those who are in the three last times, with subtle passions, and so on.
Evaṁ Daṁsaṇāvaraṇīya-Antarāiyāṇāṁ || 17 ||
Just as the pattern of the inferior and non-inferior temporal pains of the knowledge-obscuring karma has been described, so also the pattern of the ownership of the inferior and non-inferior temporal pains of the sight-obscuring karma and the obstructing karma should be described. || 17 ||
Sāmittena Jahaṇṇapade Veyanīpaveyaṇā Kālado Jahaṇiyā Kassā? || 18 ||
Whose is the pain of the pain-producing karma, which is inferior in relation to time, in the context of ownership, in the inferior position? || 18 ||

[584]
The pain of the pain-producing karma of a being who is in the last moment of the time of becoming a worthy being is less than the time of the pain of the pain-producing karma. [19]
The meaning is that the pain of the said pain-producing karma of a worthy being who is present in the last moment of the Aayogik-Kevali Gunasthan is less, because there only one moment of his existence remains.
There is a pain of his non-lesser state, different from that lesser pain. [20]
One should understand the diversity of their masters as much as possible, similar to the pain-producing karma. And so, the lifespan, name and lineage karmas. [21]
In the same way, one should also describe the lesser and non-lesser time-pains of the lifespan, name and lineage karmas. [21]
Whose pain of the deluding karma is less than the time of the pain, in the context of the lesser state, due to the ownership? [22]
The pain of the deluding karma of a being who is in the last moment of the time of the Kshapak Sakshaya state is less than the time of the pain. [23]
The meaning is that the pain of the deluding karma of a Kshapak being who is present in the last moment of the subtle Sampraaya Gunasthan is less than the time of the pain.
There is a non-lesser pain of the deluding karma, different from that lesser pain. [24]
The ownership is finished.
Now, the authority of the Alpabahutva Anuyo-gadwara is obtained. There are three Anuyo-gadwaras in it - in the lesser state, in the excellent state and in the lesser-excellent state. [25]
The pains of all eight karmas are equal, in the context of the lesser state, less than the time. [26]

[4, 2, 6, 27] In the context of the eight karmas, the duration of the pain of the karma is considered in this section.
[585] The reason for this is that in the context, the duration of the pain of the karma is considered in this section.
[27] The pain of the karma of Ayus is the least intense in terms of duration.
[28] The pain of the karma of Name and Gotra is equal and countless times more intense than the pain of the karma of Ayus.
[29] The pain of the karma of Knowledge-Obstruction, Perception-Obstruction, Vedaniya, and Antaray is equal and significantly more intense than the pain of the karma of Ayus.
[30] The pain of the karma of Mohaniya is countless times more intense than the pain of the karma of Ayus.
[31] In the context of the least intense, the pain of the eight karmas is equal and less intense than the pain of the karma of Ayus.
[32] The pain of the karma of Ayus is countless times more intense than the pain of the karma of Ayus.
[33] The pain of the karma of Name and Gotra is equal and countless times more intense than the pain of the karma of Ayus.
[34] The pain of the karma of Knowledge-Obstruction, Perception-Obstruction, Vedaniya, and Antaray is equal and significantly more intense than the pain of the karma of Ayus.
[35] The pain of the karma of Mohaniya is countless times more intense than the pain of the karma of Ayus.
The section on the intensity of the pain of the karma is complete.

Since the cause of the understanding of the aforementioned subject is the establishment of the state of the original nature, therefore, these four gates of the Anuyōga are obtained in its notification. This is the meaning that should be known.

These are the two *Anuyogadwaras* in *Niseyaparupana*: *Anantarovanidha* and *Paramparovanidha*. [101]
*Anantarovanidha* is the *Niseka* of the *Panchendriya*, *Sanni*, *Micchaitti*, and *Pajjataya* beings, who have accumulated three thousand years of *Aabada* of *Jnanaavaran*, *Darsanavaran*, *Vedaniya*, and *Antaraya* karmas. The *Pradesagg* that is *Nisikta* in the first time is very much, the *Pradesagg* that is *Nisikta* in the second time is less than that, the *Pradesagg* that is *Nisikta* in the third time is less than that, and so on, until it reaches thirty *Kodakod* *Sagaropama*. [102]
The beings who have accumulated thirty *Kodakod* *Sagaropama* of *Aabada* of *Jnanaavaran*, *Darsanavaran*, *Vedaniya*, and *Antaraya* karmas, their *Aabada* time is thirty thousand years. It is not possible for beings who have accumulated less than that to have such *Aabada*. Therefore, the word "Panchendriya" here excludes *Ekendriya* and *Vikalendriya*, the word "Sanni" excludes *Asanni*, the word "Micchaitti" excludes *Samyagdristi*, and the word "Pajjataya" excludes *Aparaptajeeva*. Because, it is not possible for them to accumulate such *Aabada*. The *Niseka* of the *Pradesagg* of these four karmas is not possible in the *Aabada* time of those beings who have accumulated such *Aabada*. This is indicated by the word "Aabada" in the sutra.
The beings who have accumulated seven thousand years of *Aabada* of *Mohaniya* karma, the *Pradesagg* that is *Nisikta* in the first time is very much, the *Pradesagg* that is *Nisikta* in the second time is less than that, the *Pradesagg* that is *Nisikta* in the third time is less than that, and so on, until it reaches seventy *Kodakod* *Sagaropama*. [103]
The meaning of the words "Panchendriya" etc. should be understood in the same way as before.

**592]**

For five-sensed, conscious beings, whether with right or wrong faith, the extent of the **Ayu** karma, excluding the **Aabaddha** (obstruction) of one-third of a **Purvakoti** (previous aeon), is as follows:

* The **Padesagga** (extent of the karma) in the first **Samaya** (time period) is vast.
* The **Padesagga** in the second **Samaya** is less than the first.
* The **Padesagga** in the third **Samaya** is less than the second.

This continues in a decreasing manner, reaching a limit of thirty **Sagaropama** (ocean-like) units. || 104 ||

Since the **Ayu** of **Samyagdristi** (right faith) beings in the first **Samaya** of the **Purvakoti** can reach a maximum of thirty **Sagaropama** units, and the **Ayu** of **Mithyadristi** (wrong faith) beings in the same **Samaya** can also reach the same maximum, the terms "**Samyagdristi**" and "**Mithyadristi**" are used in this context.

For five-sensed, conscious beings with wrong faith, the extent of the **Nama** and **Gotra** karma, excluding the **Aabaddha** of two thousand years, is as follows:

* The **Padesagga** in the first **Samaya** is vast.
* The **Padesagga** in the second **Samaya** is less than the first.
* The **Padesagga** in the third **Samaya** is less than the second.

This continues in a decreasing manner, reaching a limit of twenty **Koda** (billion) **Sagaropama** units. || 105 ||

For five-sensed, conscious beings with wrong faith and **Apayattaka** (limited) **Ayu**, the extent of the seven **Karmas** excluding the **Aabaddha** of one **Antomuhurta** (last moment of a **Muhurta**), is as follows:

* The **Padesagga** in the first **Samaya** is vast.
* The **Padesagga** in the second **Samaya** is less than the first.
* The **Padesagga** in the third **Samaya** is less than the second.

This continues in a decreasing manner, reaching a limit of **Antahkoda** (inner billion) **Sagaropama** units. || 106 ||

[594] In the Chakkhandagama, the Veyanakhand
[4, 2, 4, 109] The lifespan of the Asangi Panchaindriya, Chaturindriya, Triindriya, Dwiindriya, and Badar Ekendriya Paryapta beings, in terms of the previous koti, is as follows: one-third of the previous koti, two months, sixteen days plus, four years, and seven thousand years plus, respectively.  Excluding the Aabaadha, the Pradesh-pind that is Nisikta in the first time is very much, the Pradesh-pind that is Nisikta in the second time is less special, and the Pradesh-pind that is Nisikta in the third time is even less special.  In this way, the Pradesh-pind becomes less and less special, until it reaches the Asankhyeyadibhaga of the Palyopama, less than the previous koti. || 109 ||

The lifespan of the Asangi Panchaindriya, Chaturindriya, Triindriya, Dwiindriya, and Badar Ekendriya Paryapta beings, in terms of the previous koti, is as follows: one koti, six months, thirty-six nights and days, twelve years, and twenty-two thousand years, respectively.  Accordingly, the Aabaadha of their lifespan, in terms of the previous koti, is as follows: one-third of the previous koti, two months, sixteen nights and days plus, four years, and seven thousand years plus, respectively.  Excluding this Aabaadha, the Nisheka Rachana of their lifespan karma is formed.  Here, this meaning should be understood.

The lifespan of the Asangi Panchaindriya, Chaturindriya, Triindriya, Dwiindriya, and Badar Ekendriya Aparyapta, and the Sukshma Ekendriya Paryapta and Aparyapta beings, excluding the Aabaadha of the Antarmukhuta, is as follows: the Pradesh-pind that is Nisikta in the first time is very much, the Pradesh-pind that is Nisikta in the second time is less special, and the Pradesh-pind that is Nisikta in the third time is even less special.  In this way, the Pradesh-pind becomes less and less special, until it reaches the Asankhyeyadibhaga of the Palyopama, less than the three, seven, and two parts of one Sagaropama, fifty Sagaropama, twenty-five Sagaropama, and one thousand Sagaropama, respectively. || 110 ||

[ 4, 2, 6, 116 ]  The  *Veeyanmahahiyar*  binds the *Veeyanakaalvihaan*  to the *Aabaadhakundayparoovana*
[ 595
The meaning is that except for the lifespan of the *Asanjee*  *Panchendriya*, *Chaturindriya*, *Triindriya*, and *Dwiindriya*; the remaining seven *Karmas*  of these insufficient beings are bound in the *Sagaropama*  in the proportion of three, seven, and two parts respectively, out of seven parts, which are less than one thousand, one hundred and fifty, and twenty-five *Palyopama*  respectively.  And the *Baadar*  *Ekendriya*  insufficient and the *Sookshma*  *Ekendriya*  sufficient and insufficient beings bind their *Utkrushta*  state in the *Sagaropama*  which is less than the *Asankhyat*  part of the *Palyopama*, in the proportion of three, seven, and two parts respectively, out of the said seven parts.  Their *Antarmoohoort*  only *Aabaaba*  is left out, and the rest of the state is bound by the *Nisek*  creation.

The **utkrussta** (excellent) **Jnanavaraaniyaveeyana** is experienced by the being who is bound by **utkrussta** (excellent) **sanklesha** (afflictions), who is **panchendriya** (five senses), **sanjni** (conscious), **mithyadristi** (false belief), **sabahhi pajjatthi** (possessing all perfections), **pajjattagada** (attained the state of perfection), **saagaruvajoga** (possessing the right use of the body), **jagare** (awake), and **niyama** (following the rules) ||8||
This sutra describes the nature of the being who binds the **utkrussta** (excellent) **anubhaga** (experience). It states that this being must be **sanjni** (conscious) and **panchendriya** (five senses). This implies that **asanjni** (unconscious), **vikaleendriya** (disabled senses), and **ekendriya** (one sense) beings cannot bind the **utkrussta** (excellent) **anubhaga**. The word "**annadaren**" indicates that the being who binds the **utkrussta** (excellent) **anubhaga** does not need to possess specific qualities like **veda** (knowledge) or **avagahana** (understanding). It can be any **sanjni** (conscious) and **panchendriya** (five senses) being with or without **veda** and **avagahana**. The binding of the **utkrussta** (excellent) **anubhaga** is not possible in the **aparaptakala** (incomplete time), **darshanoupayogakala** (time of using knowledge), or **supta** (sleeping) states. Therefore, the sutra uses words like "**pajjat**" to indicate the **paraptakala** (complete time), **saagaruvajoga** (right use of the body), and **jagare** (awake) states. The binding of the **utkrussta** (excellent) **anubhaga** occurs only through **utkrussta** (excellent) **sanklesha** (afflictions). This implies that it does not occur in the first five **sanklesha** (afflictions) states - **manda** (mild), **mandatar** (milder), **mandatam** (mildest), **tivra** (intense), **tivratar** (more intense) - but only in the final **tivratam** (most intense) state.

The Veeyana Khand in the Chakkhandagama
[4, 2, 7, 9]

It should be understood that the meaning of this Sutra is that the section bound by such a being, which is present due to its essence, is superior to the pain feeling of its knowledge-obscuring.
That of a one-sense, or two-sense, or three-sense, or four-sense, or five-sense, or conscious, or unconscious, or subtle, or sufficient, or insufficient, or other being, existing in another motion, is superior to the pain feeling of its knowledge-obscuring. || 9 ||

The said superior section's essence is of a one-sense, or two-sense, or three-sense, or four-sense, or five-sense, or conscious, or unconscious, or subtle, or sufficient, or insufficient, or other being, existing in another motion; therefore, the said superior section's essence is superior to the pain feeling of its knowledge-obscuring. || 9 ||

There is a different, inferior feeling of pain. || 10 ||

Similarly, one should know the form of the feeling of pain related to the sight-obscuring, delusion-obscuring, and obstruction. || 11 ||

In the superior term, whose pain feeling is superior to the pain feeling of the pain-worthy? || 12 ||

Whose section is bound by another subtle-existence-purification-restrained destroyer in the final time, and whose essence is that, is superior to the pain feeling of the pain-worthy. || 13 ||

To explain whose essence it is, this further Sutra is said:
Its essence is of the one who has destroyed the subtle passions, is free from attachment, is veiled, and is a perfect yogi, therefore, their pain-worthy is superior to the pain feeling. || 14 ||

Page #740:

[4, 2, 7, 19]
arumahahiyarē veyaṇabhāvavihāṇē sāmittāṁ
[615
The meaning is that even for one who has attained the excellent section of the subtle saṃpārāya, restrained, seven-sense-possessing, and has attained the subtle-passion, sa-yogika-kevali and a-yogika-kevali guṇasthānas, the feeling of the vedaniya is superior to the feeling of the vedanā. In the sūtra, the a-yogika-kevali should be understood by the second 'vā' word.
tavvadirittamaṇukkasā. || 15 ||
The above-mentioned excellent feeling is different from its non-excellent feeling. || 15 ||
evaṁ nāma - godāṇaṁ || 16 ||
Just as the excellent and non-excellent feeling-vedanās of the vedaniya have been described, so also should one know the excellent and non-excellent feeling-vedanās of the name and lineage karmas. || The reason for this is that the binding of the excellent section of the yaśakīrti nāmakarma and the high lineage is found at the end of the said subtle saṃpārāya destroyer.
sāmittē ukkassapadē āuvavēyaṇā bhāvadō ukkassīyā kassā? || 17 ||
In the excellent position from ownership, whose feeling of the āyu karma is superior to the feeling of the vedanā? || aṇṇadarēṇa appamatta sañjadēṇa sāgāra - jāgārattappāoggavisudvēṇa baddhallayaṁ jassā taṁ
santakammamatthi || 18 ||
The feeling of the āyu karma is superior to the feeling of the vedanā for that other, non-negligent, restrained, who has bound the excellent section of the āyu karma with the help of the concrete use, the awakened, and the purity suitable for it, and whose essence is also present. || 18 ||
By the purity suitable for it, one should understand that the binding of the excellent section of the āyu karma does not happen by excessive purity and excessive affliction. The essence of the excellent section of the āyu karma is determined by the next sūtra.
taṁ sañjaddassā vā aṇuttara vimānavāsiy adevassā vā tassā āuvavēyaṇā bhāvadō ukkassā. || 19 ||
The essence of its excellent section is present in the restrained and the anuttara vimānavāsi deva. Therefore, the feeling of its āyu karma is superior to the feeling of the vedanā. || 19 ||
By 'restrained' here, one should understand the three suppressors, namely, apūrva-karaṇa, anivṛtti-karaṇa, and subtle saṃpārāya, as well as the suppressed passions and the negligent restrained. Among the negligent restrained, one should understand the essence of its excellent section to be present in that negligent restrained who, having bound its excellent section in the state of non-negligent restrained, subsequently attained the negligent restrained guṇasthāna.

Here, by the word "human being", it is indicated that the gods and the hell-beings do not bind Ayukarma related to the lower animal realm. The karmas which are increasing and decreasing every moment, in the form of defilement and purity, are called "unchanging karmas", and those karmas which are in a state of change, and which can be attained by other karmas, in one, two, or more moments, are called "changing karmas". These are of three types, according to their excellence, mediocrity, and inferiority. The extremely inferior and extremely excellent karmas are not fit for binding Ayukarma. The karmas which are situated between these two, should be understood as "changing middle karmas".

[4, 2, 7, 177] The Veeyanmahaahiyar (great torment) is the destruction of the Veeyanbhaav (tormenting emotions) and the first stage of the Chuliya (purification). [627

The lower birth is infinite times more tormenting than the higher birth. || 167 || From that, ill-fame is infinite times more tormenting. || 168 || From that, the non-perceivable torment is infinite times more tormenting. || 169 || From that, both fame and higher birth are equal and infinite times more tormenting. || 170 || From that, the perceivable torment is infinite times more tormenting. || 171 || From that, the hellish existence is infinite times more tormenting. || 172 || From that, the heavenly existence is infinite times more tormenting. || 173 || From that, the physical body is infinite times more tormenting. || 174 ||

The sixty-four verses of the Jghana Maha Danda (great punishment) are complete.

1. The Veeyanbhaavvihaan (destruction of tormenting emotions) and the first stage of the Chuliya (purification) are the result of the arising of the Saavay (with attachment) and Virat (without attachment) infinite karmas. The destruction of the Darshanmoha (delusion of perception) and the suppression of the Kaasay (passions) are also the result of the arising of the Uvasam (suppression). || 7 || The destruction of the Kheenmoha (subtle delusion) and the attainment of the Jina (liberated) and the Niyama (control) are also the result of the arising of the Asankhejj (innumerable) karmas. The time of their destruction is the opposite (the number of times they are destroyed is less than the number of times they arise). || 8 ||

These two verses describe the eleven stages of the Gunashreni (series of qualities). The next 22 (175-96) verses explain them in detail.

The Gunashreiniguna (quality of the series of qualities) of the destruction of the Darshanmoha (delusion of perception) is the least. || 175 || The Gunashreiniguna of the Sanjadasanjad (controlled and uncontrolled) is innumerable times greater. || 176 || The Gunashreiniguna of the Adhapavattasanjad (controlled by the self) is innumerable times greater. || 177 ||

[630]  Chapter on the Ve yana Khand in the  Chakkhandagama

[4, 2, 7, 199] How many A vibhaga Prati cheda are there in one place? There are infinite A vibhaga Prati cheda, which are infinite times greater than all the living beings. So many A vibhaga Prati cheda are there in one place. || 199 ||

By taking all the atoms related to the smallest Anu bhaga Sthana and combining them, then removing the color, smell and taste of the atom with the slowest Anu bhaga, and then dividing it only by the sense of touch, until it can be divided. The final division that is obtained is called A vibhaga Prati cheda. By the measure of this final division, when all the Sparsha Khand are divided, infinite times more A vibhaga Prati cheda are obtained in one Anu bhaga Sthana than all the living beings. The name of all these divisions separately is 'Varga'. ||

How many Sthana are there in the Sthana Prarupana? There are as many Sthana as there are countless Lokas. || 200 ||

How much is the Antar in the Antar Prarupana for each Sthana? The Antar is infinite times greater than all the living beings. || 201 ||

In the Kandaya Prarupana, there are Ananta Bhaga Vriddhi Kandaya, Asankhya Bhaga Vriddhi Kandaya, Sankhya Bhaga Vriddhi Kandaya, Sankhya Guna Vriddhi Kandaya, Asankhya Guna Vriddhi Kandaya, and Ananta Guna Vriddhi Kandaya. || 202 ||

In the Oj Yugma Prarupana, the A vibhaga Prati cheda are Krit Yugma, the Sthana are Krit Yugma, and the Kandaya are Krit Yugma. || 203 ||

_ Oj Ras are of two types - Kali Oj and Tejo Oj. The Ras in which one digit remains after dividing by four is called Kali Oj Ras. For example, 13 (13+4=3 remainder 1). The Ras in which three digits remain after dividing by four is called Tejo Oj. For example, 15

( 15 ÷ 4 = 3 remainder 3 ).  The meaning of the pair is the same. It is of two types, due to the difference between the Kṛtayuga and the Bādarayuga. The quantity in which there is no remainder when divided by four is called Kṛtayuga. For example, 16 ( 16 ÷ 4 = 4 remainder 0 ). The quantity in which there is a remainder of two digits when divided by four is called Bādarayuga. For example, 14 ( 14 ÷ 4 = 3 remainder 2 ).

[642] In the Chakkhandagama, the Veyanakhand states:

[4, 2, 8, 7] The perception of attachment, which arises from the external objects and their perception, causes the knowledge-obscuring pain. [6]
The perception of night, food, and their related consequences causes the knowledge-obscuring pain. [7] Similarly, the perception of anger, pride, deceit, greed, attachment, aversion, delusion, and love causes the knowledge-obscuring pain. [8]

Anger is the consequence of the soul that causes burning of the heart. Pride is the consequence that arises from the desire for knowledge, power, etc. Deceit is the behavior that is adopted to cover up the feelings of the inner self. Greed is the feeling of possessiveness towards external objects. Maya, greed, the three Vedas, humor, and pleasure are all included in attachment, while anger, pride, displeasure, sorrow, disgust, and fear are all included in aversion. Delusion is the collection of the four poisons (anger, pride, deceit, and greed), the nine non-poisons (humor, etc.), and falsehood. Love is the consequence of the soul that is characterized by affection. These different causes produce the knowledge-obscuring pain. Although these perceptions are interconnected, there is still a subtle difference between them.

The perception of cause causes the knowledge-obscuring pain. [9]

The desire for the past lives of Chakravarti, Baldev, Narayan, and Prati Narayan, etc., is called cause.

The perception of gossip, conflict, backbiting, attachment, aversion, attachment, degradation, pride, object of perception, delusion, false knowledge, false perception, and practice causes the knowledge-obscuring pain. [10]

The act of revealing the faults of another person, even if they don't exist, under the influence of the poisons is called gossip. The act of causing harm to another person through weapons, sticks, words, etc., under the influence of the poisons is called conflict. The act of revealing the faults of another person under the influence of anger, etc., is called backbiting. Attachment to children, spouses, etc., is called attachment, and the opposite of this is called aversion. The external objects that cause the poisons like anger, etc., are called attachment. Degradation refers to deceit and trickery. The word "pride" here refers to the instruments of measurement and weighing (like "prastha", "seer", and "half seer", etc.).

has been done. Binding of Jnanavaraniya occurs due to keeping them less or more. The word Maya should be taken as Meya here. Because in Prakrit, according to the sutra 'E A Chchch Samaana' etc., Akar comes in place of Ekar. Meya refers to things like barley and wheat, which are suitable for measuring and weighing. Since these are caused by the wrong conduct of the measurer and weigher, they are also considered to be the cause of the binding of Jnanavarana karma. The word Mosha here refers to theft. The knowledge related to the interest of other philosophies like Sankhya and Mimamsa is called Mithyajnan! Mithyatva and Samyagmithyatva are called Mithyadarshan. The tendency of these yogas of mind, speech and body is called Prayoga. Due to all these reasons, there is pain of Jnanavaraniya. In Tattvarth Sutra (8-1), Mithyal, Avirati, Pramada, Kashaya and Yoga are generally called the cause of binding. There should be no contradiction with that here. Because here, anger, pride, Maya, greed, attachment, defects, delusion, love, nidana, abhyakhyan, quarrel, jealousy, attraction, aversion, upadhi, degradation, pride, Meya and Mosha; all these are included in Kashaya. Mithyajnan and Mithyadarshan should be understood under Mithyatva and Prayoga Pratyay under Yoga.

Similarly, the manifestation of the causes of pain of the remaining seven karmas should be done. || 11 ||
Ujjusu Dassana Nanavaraniya Veyana Jogapachaye Payadi - Padesagam. || 12 ||
With respect to the Riju Sutra Nay, the pain of Jnanavaraniya is in the form of nature and Pradesh (group of Pradesh) due to Yoga Pratyay. || 12 ||
Kasa Yapachaye Dvidi - Anubhag Veyana. || 13 ||
With respect to the said Riju Sutra Nay, there is pain of the state of Jnanavarana and Anubhag pain due to Kashaya Pratyay. || 13 ||
Evam Sattanam Kammanam || 14 ||
Just as the manifestation of the causes of Jnanavaraniya has been done with respect to the Riju Sutra Nay, similarly, the manifestation of the causes of the remaining seven karmas should also be done with respect to the said Nay. || 14 ||
Saddanas Avattvyam || 15 ||
The pain of Jnanavaraniya is not to be spoken of with respect to Shabd Nay. || 15 ||
In Shabd Nay, there is no possibility of samas etc., so the pain of Jnanavaraniya in the form of nature and Pradesh due to Yoga Pratyay and the pain of its state and Anubhag due to Kashaya Pratyay, it is not possible to say with respect to the said Nay. Therefore, it is said here that it is not to be spoken of with respect to Shabd Nay.

It is also experienced by the Nojiva. || 3 ||
The Nojiva is the name of the Pudgalaskandha which receives the Upacaya with infinite and countless Vilasa Upacayas, because it lacks knowledge and vision. Since the Jiva is not separate from it, it is also considered as Nojiva here.
This Vedana is also experienced by many Jivas. || 4 ||

And the second **Veyana** word means '**Vedana** is **Veyana**', according to this **Nirukti**.

All karma is considered to be of the nature of karma, according to the Naigama Nay. || 2 ||

This description is being made considering all karma to be of the nature of karma, according to the Naigama Nay. || 2 ||

The Naigama Nay is the acceptance of the future karma by making a resolution in the present. That which produces ignorance etc. is called nature. According to the said Naigama Nay, all karma, whether bound, ripened or quiescent, is of the nature of karma. That which is transformed from the pudgalaskandha into the form of fruit-giving is called ripened. That which is acquiring the form of karma through the results of false belief and non-restraint etc. is called bound. And that which is different from both these states is called quiescent.
The knowledge-obscuring karma is a bound karma. || 3 ||

The knowledge-obscuring karma is a bound karma. || 3 ||

No karma gives its fruit during the time of binding, therefore, although the bound karma cannot be called karma from this point of view, yet since it is going to give fruit in the future, therefore, here the knowledge-obscuring karma is called bound karma.
The knowledge-obscuring karma is a ripened karma. || 4 ||

The knowledge-obscuring karma is a ripened karma. || 4 ||

The knowledge-obscuring karma is a quiescent karma. || 5 ||

According to the Straight-thread principle, the pain of the knowledge-obscuring karma is the pain that arises from the fruition of the aroused karma. || 56 ||
The subject of the Straight-thread principle is the present state. Therefore, the pain of the knowledge-obscuring karma arises at the time when the karma-bond produces ignorance. After that time, the pain of the knowledge-obscuring karma is not possible, because the karma-state of the pudgala-skandha, which has been transformed into the form of ignorance, is destroyed. Similarly, the said pain of the knowledge-obscuring karma is not possible before the time when ignorance is produced, because the karmas do not have the power to produce ignorance at that time. In the same way, the remaining seven karmas should be explained according to the Straight-thread principle. || 57 ||

[4, 2, 11, 11] The *veyaṇa* (pain) of the *mahahiyāre* (great *hiyāre*) is *veyaṇagādivihaṇa* (destruction of the *veyaṇa* and other things).
[651] The meaning is that because the *jīvapradeśa* (living regions) become agitated due to *rāga* (attachment), *dveṣa* (aversion), *bhaya* (fear), and *vedanā* (pain), etc., the *karmapradeśa* (regions of karma) that are associated with them also become agitated. Therefore, in relation to the *naya* (principles) mentioned here, the pain of *jñānāvaraṇīya* (knowledge-obscuring karma) is said to be somewhat existent.
*Siyā dvidāvidā* (It is twofold) || 3 || The said pain is somewhat existent and non-existent || 3 ||
Those *chhadmastha* (hidden) *jīva* (living beings) who do not experience *saṁkleśa* (affliction) even when *vyādhi* (disease) and *vedanā* (pain) are present, do not have agitation in many of their *jīvapradeśa* (living regions). Therefore, the *karmapradeśa* (regions of karma) associated with them are also free from agitation (existent).

In the *Chakkhandagama*, the *Veyanakhand* section of the *Sad-dhana* should be considered. ||12|| This is the expectation of the *Shabda* *naya*. ||12||

When *karma* *paryaya* are obtained due to the *mithya-darsana* etc. causes, the *karma* *paryaya* are bound to the *pudgala-skandha* which is situated in its own form. This binding is called *anantara-bandha* at the first time of transformation from the said *paryaya*. Since they are transformed from the *karma* *paryaya* only after leaving the *karma* *varna* form *paryaya*, their binding is called *anantara-bandha*. The binding of the *karma-pudgala-skandha* and the *jiva-pradesa* from the second time of binding onwards is called *parampara-bandha*. Since the binding of those *karma-pudgala* occurs at the first time and their binding continues at the second, third, and subsequent times, this binding is called *parampara-bandha*. And since the *jiva* finds unity in both, their binding is also called *tadu-bhaya-bandha*.
Thus, the remaining seven *karma* should be known in the same way. ||5||
*Sangraha-naya* is the *Jnana-avaraneya-vedana* *anantara-bandha*. ||6|| It is also *parampara-bandha*. ||7||
Thus, the remaining seven *karma* should be explained in the same way with respect to *sangraha-naya*.

[654] In the Chakkhandagama, the Veyanakhand (chapter on the nature of experience)

[4, 2, 13, 4] The association with the place of experience is of two types: inferior association with the place of experience and superior association with the place of experience. || 3 ||

The inferior association with the place of experience is described as "thappa" (temporary). || 4 ||

The superior association with the place of experience is of four types: by substance, by field, by time, and by state. || 5 ||

For a being whose experience of the knowledge-obscuring karma is superior in terms of substance, is it superior or inferior in terms of field? || 6 ||

It is inferior in terms of field, being inferior by countless qualities. || 7 ||

For that being, is it superior or inferior in terms of time? || 8 ||

It is both superior and inferior in terms of time. || 9 ||

It is inferior to the superior by one time period. || 10 ||

For that being, is it superior or inferior in terms of state? || 11 ||

It is both superior and inferior in terms of state. || 12 ||

It is inferior to the superior by falling into the six places of experience. || 13 ||

If a two-bodied being, a hell-being, binds an excellent portion with an excellent perception, with an excellent affliction, then it experiences an excellent state of experience. But if there is no such excellent perception, then by rule, it experiences an inferior state of experience.

This inferior state of experience falls into these six types of losses.

The **karma** accumulated in the second **samaya** is called **Samayaprabaddhārthata** of the second **samaya**. This should be continued till the last **samaya** of **karma** existence. Then, by establishing the **Samayaprabaddhārthata** of one **samaya** and multiplying it by thirty **Koḍakoḍi** **Sāgaropamas**, we get the number of types of each **karma**. -
How many types of **Veṇīya** karma are there? || 28 || Each type of **Veṇīya** karma is equal to the number obtained by multiplying thirty and fifteen **Koḍakoḍi** **Sāgaropamas** by the **Samayaprabaddhārtha** of each type. || 29 || These are the number of types. || 30 ||

[4, 2, 15, 9] This is the division of the parts of the Vedaniya karma.
[683] How many types of Vedaniya karma are there? || 49 ||
The Kevali, having attained liberation from the bondage of karma, has all the types of Vedaniya karma, while other than the Kevali, there is only one type of Vedaniya karma. || 50 ||
When multiplied by the Kshetra-pratyasa, it gives the number of types of Vedaniya karma in the Kshetra-pratyasa. || 51 ||
There are so many types of Vedaniya karma. || 52 ||
Similarly, the types of Ayus, Names and Gotras should be known. || 53 ||

15. The division of the parts of the Vedaniya karma. || 1 ||
Now the Anuyogadvara of the division of the parts of the Vedaniya karma is attained. || 1 ||
There are three Anuyogadvaras in this - Prakruti-arthata, Samaya-prabaddha-arthata and Kshetra-pratyasa. || 2 ||
In Prakruti-arthata, what is the proportion of the types of Jnana-avareniya and Darsana-avareniya karma to all the types of karma? || 3 ||
They are slightly less than half of all the types of karma. || 4 ||
What is the proportion of the types of Vedaniya, Mohaniya, Ayus, Names, Gotras and Antaraya karma to all the types of karma? || 5 ||
They are an immeasurable fraction of all the types of karma. || 6 ||
Now the Samaya-prabaddha-arthata is attained. || 7 ||
In Samaya-prabaddha-arthata, if each type of Jnana-avareniya and Darsana-avareniya karma is multiplied by thirty-three oceans of kotis, what is the proportion of that to all the types of karma? || 8 ||
It is slightly less than half of all the types of karma. || 9 ||

**3. Phasana-Yogaddaram Phas-e Tti ||1|| Ab Sparsh Anuyogadwar Prakrit Hai ||1||**

**In the fifth section of the six-part scripture of Siri-Bhagvant-Pupphadant-Bhudbali-Panido, the topic of the "Anuyogadwar" is discussed.  The first of these is the "Sparsh Anuyogadwar".**

**Tath Imani Solas Aniyogaddarani Nadavvani Bhavati - Phasanikkheve Phasanayavibhasanad-ae Phasanam-avihane Phasadavvavihane Phasakhettav-ihane Phasakalavihane Phasabhavv-ihane Phasapacayavihane Phassamittav-ihane Phasphasavihane Phasgaiv-ihane Phasanantaravihane Phassanniyasavihane Phasparimanavihane Phasbhaga-bhaga-vihane Phasappabahue Tti ||2||**

**There are sixteen "Aniyogaddar" to be known: Sparshanik-sheve, Sparshanayavibhasanata, Sparshanam-avihane, Phasadavv-avihane, Phasakhettav-ihane, Phasakalavihane, Phasabhavv-ihane, Phasapacayavihane, Phassamittav-ihane, Phasphasavihane, Phasgaiv-ihane, Phasanantaravihane, Phassanniyasavihane, Phasparimanavihane, Phasbhaga-bhaga-vihane, and Phasappabahue.**

**Phasanikkheve Tti ||3||**

**The first of these sixteen is "Sparshanik-sheve".  Its explanation is given below.**

**Terasav-ihe Phasanikkheve - Nam-phase Thavan-phase Davv-phase Ey-khet-phase Anantar-khet-phase Des-phase Tay-phase Savv-phase Phas-phase Karm-phase Bandh-phase Chedi ||4||**

**This "Sparshanik-sheve" is of thirteen types: Nam-phase, Thavan-phase, Davv-phase, Ey-khet-phase, Anantar-khet-phase, Des-phase, Tay-phase, Savv-phase, Phas-phase, Karm-phase, Bandh-phase, Bhavy-phase, and Bhav-phase.**

**Here, the thirteen meanings of the word "Sparsh" should be understood in a general sense, as there are many other specific meanings.  The nature of these will be explained by the author of the original text through the use of sutras.**

It is also the **Sparśa** of **Akṣa**, **Varāṭaka**, and all other things that are established in this way. All of these are called **Thavaṇa-Sparśa**. **10.**

**Ch. 87**

Here, the terms **Kāṣṭhakarma** etc. refer to the **establishment of the existence of something**. The terms **Akṣa** and **Varāṭaka** etc. refer to the **establishment of the non-existence of something**. The phrase "**Je cāmaṇṇe evamādiyā**" refers to all other things that are established in this way. This should be understood in relation to both types of establishment.

**Chapter on Karma**
[5, 4, 15]
Whatever is called *prayoga karma*... [15]... is of three types: *manaprayoga karma*, *vacanaprayoga karma*, and *kayaprayoga karma*. [16]... It is present in beings in the state of *samsara* and in *sayogikevali*s. [17]... All of this is called *prayoga karma*. [18]...
Now, the authority on *samudana karma*... [19]... is that which is received as a result of the eight, seven, or six types of karma. All of this is called *samudana karma*. [20]...
Here, *samudana* refers to the differentiation. The *karman* *pudgala* *skandha* that arises due to *mithyadarshana* etc. and undergoes transformation into eight, seven, or six types of karma should be understood as *samudana karma*.
Whatever is called *adha karma*... [21]... is that which is produced by *upadravana*, *vidravana*, *paritavana*, and *arambha*. All of this is called *adha karma*. [22]...
*Upadravana* is the name for causing distress to a being, *vidravana* is the name for actions like severing limbs, *paritavana* is the name for causing suffering, and *arambha* is the name for causing the death of beings. The word *krita* means action. The *audarika* body that is produced by the aforementioned actions of *upadravana* etc. should be understood as *adha karma*.
Whatever is called *iryavah karma*... [23]... is that which is present in beings with *chhadmasthavitaraga*s and in *sayogikevali*s. All of this is called *iryavah karma*. [24]...
Here, *yoga* is the meaning. The karma whose path, i.e., cause, is only *yoga* should be understood as *iryavah karma*. It is present in beings with *chhadmasthavitaraga*s, in those who have subdued their passions and those who have weakened their passions, and in *sayogikevali* Jinas. It is not possible for other beings in *samsara* because, due to their karma, they have passions and negligence, etc., in addition to *bhuta yoga*.

[5, 4, 31] The chapter on the application of karma, the form of karma.
[695] Karma is called "tavokarma" (self-inflicted karma). || 25 || It is of twelve types, both internal and external. All of them are called "tavokarma". || 26 ||
... Now, the authority of "tapa karma" (penance karma). || 25 || It is of twelve types, differentiated by internal and external. All of them are called "tapa karma". || 26 ||
What is called "kiriyakarma" (action karma)? || 27 || Being self-controlled, circumambulation, three repetitions, three prostrations, four head-bowings, and twelve cycles, all of these are called "kiriyakarma". || 28 ||
This action-based karma is of six types, differentiated by self-control, circumambulation, three repetitions, three prostrations, four head-bowings, and twelve cycles. Among them, the action performed solely in relation to the self, free from external influence, is called "atmadhin kiriyakarma" (self-controlled action karma). The salutation performed with circumambulation to the Guru, the Jina, and the Jinalaya during worship is called "padaahin kiriyakarma" (circumambulation action karma). Performing the aforementioned circumambulation and salutation three times in the twilight hours of the same day is called "tikkhutt kiriyadharma" (three repetitions action dharma). It should not be understood that the aforementioned worship, etc., is only to be performed in the three twilight hours, because there is no prohibition against them at other times, but they are to be performed regularly in those twilight hours; this is the meaning to be understood. The meaning of "onad" is prostration or being situated on the ground. It is performed three times: 1. Sitting down in front of the Jina with joy after seeing the Jina, 2. Then getting up and praying to the Jina, etc., and sitting down again, 3. Then getting up again, purifying oneself with the Samayika danda (penance), abandoning attachment to the body, etc., and meditating on the qualities of the Jina, etc., and sitting down on the ground again. The salutation performed by bowing the head at the beginning and end of Samayika, at the beginning of the Thos-samidanda, and at its end is called "chatu-shir" (four head-bowings). The twelve (443) purifications of mind, speech, and body that occur at the beginning and end of Samayika and Thos-samidanda are called "dwadasha-avart" (twelve cycles).
What is called "bhavakarma" (emotional karma)? || 29 || That which is endowed with the knowledge of karma-prābhṛta (the origin of karma) is called "bhavakarma". || 30 ||
Of all these karmas, which one is the main one here? The main one here is "samodhan karma" (attention karma). || 31 ||
|| Thus ends the chapter on the application of karma. || 4 ||

##  Translation:

[700] In the **Chakkhandagama**, the divisions of **Vaggna-Khand** are to be known as:
[5, 5, 36] Thirty-two divisions, forty-eight divisions, one hundred and forty-four divisions, one hundred and sixty-eight divisions, one hundred and ninety-two divisions, two hundred and eighty-eight divisions, three hundred and thirty-six divisions, and three hundred and eighty-four divisions. [35]

**Matigyan** (knowledge of the mind) is of four types based on the divisions of **Avgraha**, **Iha**, **Avyay**, and **Dharana**. Since each of these arises from the five senses and the mind, multiplying 4 by 6 gives us 24 divisions. However, **Vyajanavgraha** arises from only four senses excluding the mind and the eye, hence it has only 4 divisions. Combining these with the aforementioned 24 divisions gives us 28 divisions. Adding the previous 4 divisions to these gives us 32 divisions. Each of these 4, 24, 28, and 32 divisions, since they perceive the six substances (**Bahus**) and their opposites (**Ekavida**), which are 12 in total, are multiplied by 6 and 12 respectively. This gives us the total divisions mentioned in the sutras: 4 x 6 = 24, 24 x 6 = 144, 28 x 6 = 168, 32 x 6 = 192; 4 x 12 = 48, 24 x 12 = 288, 28 x 12 = 336, 32 x 12 = 384.

Therefore, the **Abhinibodhik-Jnana-Avaraniya Karma** (karma that obstructs the knowledge of liberation) is explained in another way. [36]

**Avgraha**, **Avadhana**, **Sana**, **Avalambana**, and **Medha** are synonyms for **Avgraha**. [37]

**Iha**, **Uha**, **Apoha**, **Margna**, **Gaveshana**, and **Mimamsa** are synonyms for **Iha**. [38]

**Avyay**, **Vavsayo**, **Buddhi**, **Vinnani**, **Aundi**, and **Pachaundi** are synonyms for **Avyay**. [39]

**Dharani**, **Dharana**, **Dhavana**, **Kotta**, and **Padittha** are synonyms for **Dharana**. [40]

**Sanna**, **Sadi**, **Madi**, and **Chinta** are synonyms for **Abhinibodhik Jnana**. [41]

Thus, the **Abhinibodhik-Jnana-Avaraniya Karma** is explained in another way. [42]

How many types of **Shruta-Jnana-Avaraniya Karma** (karma that obstructs the knowledge of scriptures) are there? [43]

**Shruta-Jnana** (knowledge of scriptures) is the knowledge of another object that arises from the knowledge of an object through the four types of **Matigyan** (knowledge of the mind) like **Avgraha** etc. It is of two types: **Shabdalingaj** (verbal) and **Ashabdalingaj** (non-verbal). The knowledge of fire from the sign of smoke (**linga**) is **Ashabdalingaj**, while the knowledge of meaning from words is **Shabdalingaj** **Shruta-Jnana**.

Where the realm is a cube-shaped human realm, the time is one month. Where the realm is a cube-shaped Rūcakavar island, the time is one year. Where the realm is a cube-shaped Rūcakavar island, the time is one year. 64 ||
In the time of a countable number of years, there are a countable number of islands and oceans. In the time of an uncountable number of years, there are an uncountable number of islands and oceans. 65 ||
Where the time is a countable number of years, the realm is a countable number of islands and oceans. And where the time is an uncountable number of years, the realm is an uncountable number of islands and oceans. 
Time is increased by four things - time, substance, realm, and future. When time increases, substance, realm, and future increase accordingly. When the realm increases, time may or may not increase. And when substance and category increase, realm and time may or may not increase. 66 ||
The luminous body, the karmic body, the luminous category, and the language category are all substances. Where these substances exist, the realm is a cube-shaped uncountable number of islands and oceans, and the time is an uncountable number of years. 67 ||
_The meaning is that the knowledge that perceives the luminous body as a lump of substance, perceives an uncountable number of islands and oceans as the realm, and an uncountable number of years as the past and future time. The knowledge that perceives the karmic body as a substance, also perceives an uncountable number of islands and oceans as the realm, and an uncountable number of years as the past and future time. However, it is important to understand that the realm and time of this knowledge are uncountably greater than the knowledge that perceives the luminous body. The knowledge that perceives a single luminous category without any decay, also perceives an uncountable number of islands and oceans as the realm, and an uncountable number of years as the time. However, the special feature is that the realm and time of this knowledge are uncountably greater than the knowledge that perceives the karmic body. The knowledge that perceives a single category of language substance, also perceives an uncountable number of islands and oceans as the realm, and an uncountable number of years as the time.

The **Paryushana** has been described with 705 **dravya** along with the **kshetra** and **kala** (space and time). It is important to understand that this description is based on the **tiryanch** and **manushya** (animals and humans).

The **Aaka Gaatha Sutra** provides information about the **avadhi jnana** (clairvoyance) of the **deva** (gods). The **vyantar** and **bhavanavasi** (celestial beings) have a **jghanya** (inferior) **avadhi jnana** that extends to a **kshetra** of 25 **ghanayogana** (cubic yojana). The **jyotishi** (astrologers) also have a **jghanya** **avadhi jnana** that extends to a **kshetra** of a **sankeet** (countable) number of **ghanayogana**.

The **vyantar** and **bhavanavasi** have a **jghanya** **avadhi jnana** that extends to a time period slightly less than one day. It is important to note that the **jyotishi** have a **jghanya** **avadhi jnana** that extends to a **kshetra** of a **sankeet** number of **ghanayogana**, but it is still **sankeet** times greater than the **kshetra** of the **vyantar** and **bhavanavasi**. The **jyotishi** have a longer time period for their **avadhi jnana** compared to the **vyantar** and **bhavanavasi**.

The **asurakumara** (demon princes) have a **utkrista** (superior) **avadhi jnana** that extends to a **kshetra** of an **asankeet** (uncountable) number of **karod** (crores) **ghanayogana**.

The **asurakumara** have a **utkrista** **avadhi jnana** that extends to a time period of an **asankeet** number of **varsha** (years). The remaining **vyantar**, **bhavanavasi**, and **jyotishi** also have a **utkrista** **avadhi jnana** that extends to a time period of an **asankeet** number of **varsha**. However, it is important to note that their **utkrista** time period is **sankeet** times less than the **utkrista** time period of the **asurakumara**.

The **deva** of the **Soudharma** and **Ishana** kalpas have **avadhi jnana** that extends to the first **prithvi** (earth).

[706] In the Chakkhandagama, the section on the extent of knowledge is described as follows:

[5, 5, 71] The extent of knowledge of these gods is specified as downwards. These gods know only up to the peak of their respective planes by means of their knowledge. The measure of time for their knowledge is only countless years, countless parts of a palya, and countless parts of a palya, in the order of Brahma-Brahmottara kalpas. Above the Brahma-Brahmottara kalpa, up to the Praveyak, the measure of time for the object of this knowledge is only a little less than a palya.

[71] The gods who reside in the Ananta-Pranada kalpa and the Aran-Achyuta kalpa see up to the fifth earth, and the gods of the Praveyak see up to the sixth earth.

[72] The gods who reside in the Anuttara see all the Lokanalis. These gods know the final form-based pudgala-dravya obtained by giving a part of the infinite part of the manodravya-varna in their karma as many times as there are regions in their field.

[72] Thus, after describing the dravya-kshetra, etc., which are the objects of the Desavadhi, the next gatha-sutra is obtained for the description of the dravya-kshetra, etc., which are the objects of the Parmavadhi.

[73] The extent of the Parmavadhi-jnana is countless ghana-lokas in measure, and its time-form is also countless lokas in measure. It knows the form-based dravya obtained by the agnikayika jivas, which is limited by the kshetra-upam.

[73] This Parmavadhi-jnana is only for the restrained, not for the unrestrained, and the jiva who possesses it never attains mithyatva and unrestrainedness. From this, it should also be understood that the Parmavadhi-jnani jiva does not become a god after death, because there is a lack of restraint there. Its excellent field is countless ghana-lokas in measure, and its excellent time is also countless lokas in measure. By field, it is meant the places where the agnikayika jivas reside. The agnikayika jivas who are compared to this field should be known as kshetra-upam. The infinite number of atoms that are obtained by limiting them, which are established in the form of a needle, should be known as the measure of the excellent dravya that is its object.

Page #832:
---------------------------
[5, 5, 78]
Oh, the knowledge of the limits!
[707
The excellent substance of the body of the five-sense beings, the five-sense beings, the five-sense beings, and the beings of the five-sense yoni, is the accumulation of the substance of the excellent knowledge of the limits, the substance of the luminous body. The field of the inferior knowledge of the limits in the hell beings is the measure of the cow's path, and the excellent field is the measure of the yojana. || 74 ||
The excellent knowledge of the limits is in humans, and the inferior knowledge of the limits is in both humans and animals. The field of the excellent knowledge of the limits is the measure of the world. This is a counter-argument, and the knowledge of the limits beyond this is not a counter-argument. || 75 ||
_ The meaning is that the excellent knowledge of the limits is not in the gods, the hell beings, and the animals; but it is in humans, and among them, only in the great sages, not in ordinary humans. The inferior knowledge of the limits is not in the gods and the hell beings, but only in the humans and animals who are right-seeing. The amount of substance that is obtained when one gives a part of a dense world to the generous body is the measure of the substance that is the object of the inferior knowledge of the limits. The field of that is only the immeasurable part of a dense finger. The measure of the time that is the object of this inferior knowledge of the limits is the immeasurable part of an avalika. In humans, the substance of the excellent knowledge of the limits is one atom, and its field and time are both only immeasurable worlds.
The measure of the excellent field that is the object of the knowledge of the limits of the country is the measure of the world and the time is one less than a moment. Since the knowledge of the limits of the country is destroyed in the same birth when the being becomes false, it is a counter-argument. But the supreme knowledge of the limits and the all-knowledge of the limits, both of these knowledge of the limits do not get destroyed, and since they remain until the being attains perfect knowledge, therefore both these knowledge are not counter-arguments. In this way, one should understand the natures of the knowledge of the limits covering, from the inferior to the excellent, as many alternatives of the knowledge of the limits as are possible.
How many natures are there of the karma of the knowledge of the limits covering the mind and the senses? || 76 || There are two natures of the karma of the knowledge of the limits covering the mind and the senses - the straight-minded knowledge of the limits covering the mind and the senses, and the wide-minded knowledge of the limits covering the mind and the senses. || 77 ||
The karma called the straight-minded knowledge of the limits covering the mind and the senses is of three kinds - it knows the straight-minded thought, it knows the straight-minded speech, it knows the straight-minded body. 78. ||

[708]
Chapter on the Sixfold Knowledge
[5, 5, 79] The right-minded-mind-perception-knowledge-obscuring karma is of three types. By it, the right-minded-mind-perception-knowledge, which is being obstructed, knows the meaning of the right-minded, the meaning of the right-speech, and the meaning of the right-body. || 78 ||
As the name of the activity of the mind, speech, and body, which is free from doubt, error, and indecision, is called right, so the name of the activity of the mind, speech, and body, which is full of doubt, error, and indecision, is called wrong. Among these, indecision is called non-thinking or half-thinking, doubt is called unstable perception, and error is called wrong thinking. This right-minded-mind-perception-knowledge knows only the meaning that is obtained by the mind in its right form, it does not know the meaning of the wrong-minded, which is thought of in a non-thinking, half-thinking, or opposite form.
Therefore, since the right-minded-mind-perception-knowledge is of three types, its obscuring karma, the right-minded-mind-perception-knowledge-obscuring karma, is also of three types. This is the meaning to be understood.
By means of the mind, knowing the mind, the mind-perception-knowledge knows the names, memories, thoughts, life-death, gain-loss, pleasure-pain, city-destruction, country-destruction, people-destruction, field-destruction, courtyard-destruction, assembly-destruction, town-destruction, valley-destruction, excessive rain, insufficient rain, good rain, bad rain, good harvest, bad harvest, fertile land, infertile land, fear, and disease, which are all marked by time. || 79 ||
The word 'mind' here refers to the mind-knowledge, by using the cause as the remedy for the effect. The meaning is that the right-minded-mind-perception-knowing being, by means of mind-knowledge, grasps the minds of others, and by means of mind-perception-knowledge, knows the names, memories, etc., that are present in that mind.
He knows the beings who have a manifest mind, both themselves and others, but he does not know the beings who have an unmanifest mind. || 80 ||
The word 'manifest' here means free from doubt, error, and indecision, and the word 'mind' refers to thought, by using the cause as the remedy for the effect. Therefore, the meaning is that the right-minded-mind-perception-knowing being knows the other things related to himself and other beings, whose thinking is simple and free from doubt, etc., but he does not know the things of the mind of beings who have an unmanifest mind. Here...

[5, 5, 86] According to the Prakrit rule 'एए छच्च समाणा', the णकार-varti अकार becomes long, resulting in 'वत्तमाणाणं'. Alternatively, the Prakrit word 'वत्तमाणाणं' can be interpreted as 'वर्तमान जीवोंका' (of present beings). Therefore, the meaning is that the ऋजुमति-मनःपर्ययज्ञान knows the present objects related to the three times of the present mind, but does not know the past and future objects of the mind.

[81] Due to its inferiority, it knows two or three bhava. [82] Due to its superiority, it knows seven and eight bhava.

The meaning is that due to its inferiority, it knows two bhava without the present bhava-grahana and three bhava-grahana with the present bhava-grahana. Similarly, due to its superiority, it knows seven bhava-grahana without the present bhava-grahana and eight bhava-grahana with the present bhava-grahana.

[83] It knows the गति and आगति of beings.

The meaning is that it knows the गति-आगति etc. of beings in the aforementioned time.

[84] In terms of क्षेत्र, it knows the things within the क्षेत्र of the size of गव्यूतिपृथक्त्व due to its inferiority and within the क्षेत्र of the size of योजनपृथक्त्व due to its superiority, but not beyond that.

[85] All of this is called ऋजुमतिमनःपर्ययज्ञानावरणीय कर्म.

The meaning is that the karma which covers all of this ऋजुमतिमनःपर्ययज्ञान is called ऋजुमतिमनःपर्ययज्ञानावरणीय कर्म.

[86] The विपुलमतिमनःपर्ययज्ञानावरणीय कर्म is of six types: it knows ऋजुमनोगत, अनृजुमनोगत, ऋजुवचनगत, अनृजुवचनगत, ऋजुकायगत, and अनृजुकायगत.

Similar to the previous case, here also, the विपुलमतिमनःपर्ययज्ञानावरणीय should be understood as the covering of विपुलमतिमनःपर्यय.

Page #835:
---------------------------
710] In the Chakkhandagama, the section on Vargana-Khanda
[87] Having perceived a human being with five senses and eighty-seven manas, (the soul) knows the perceptions, memory, intellect, life and death, gain and loss, pleasure and pain, destruction of cities, destruction of regions, destruction of populations, destruction of forests, destruction of mountains, destruction of towns, destruction of ports, excessive rainfall, lack of rainfall, good rainfall, bad rainfall, abundance, scarcity, safety, danger, diseases, and time-related matters of others.

[88] Through this extensive mati-manas-paryaya, the soul knows the specific perceptions, memory, intellect, contemplation, life and death, gain and loss, pleasure and pain, destruction of cities, destruction of regions, destruction of populations, destruction of forests, destruction of mountains, destruction of towns, destruction of ports, excessive rainfall, lack of rainfall, good rainfall, bad rainfall, abundance, scarcity, auspicious and inauspicious places, fear and disease of other beings.

[89] Furthermore, it knows the present conditions of its own and other beings' minds, as well as the conditions of the non-manifest minds.

[90] At least it knows the acquisition of seven to eight births, and at most, innumerable births.

[91] It knows the gati (state of existence) and agati (change of state) of the beings.

[92] At least, it knows the extent of a yojana.

[93] At most, it knows the mental conditions of the beings within the Manusottara mountain range, but not outside of it.

[94] All this is called the Vipulamati-manas-paryaya-jnanavaraniya karma.

[95] What are the manifestations of the Kevala-jnanavaraniya karma?

[96] This is the only manifestation of the Kevala-jnanavaraniya karma.

[97] And that Kevala-jnana is complete and unobstructed.

Chapter on Bandhana-Anuyogadwar
[5, 5, 159 The breaking of Vedana is by the 159th. The remaining Anuyogadwars are similar to the Vedana Anuyogadwar. || 159 ||
|| Thus ends the Anuyogadwar called Prakriti. || 5 ||
6. Bandhana-Anuyogadwar is the sixth Anuyogadwar, which deals with Bandhana. There are four types of Karma-Vibhasa of Bandhana: Bandha, Bandhaka, Bandhaniya and Bandhavidhana. || 1 ||
The meaning is that when the word 'Bandhana' is established in the Bhavasadhana, it means the union of one substance with another substance and the Samavaya of a substance with its qualities. If the word 'Bandhana' is established in the Kartri-Sadhana, it means the doer (Atma) of the Bandha, which is the Bandhaka substance and its qualities. If it is established in the Karma-Sadhana, it means the Bandhaniya, which is the Pudgala substance that is fit for Bandha. And if it is established in the Karana-Sadhana, it means the Bandhavidhana, which is the type of Bandha, such as Prakriti, Sthiti, etc. Thus, by explaining the four meanings of the word 'Bandhana', this Anuyogadwar describes Bandha, Bandhaka, Bandhaniya and the types of Bandha in order.
There are four types of Bandha: Namabandha, Sthapanabandha, Dravyabandha and Bhava-bandha. || 2 ||
Which Nayas accept which Bandhas, considering the special consideration of Bandha from the perspective of Nayas? || 3 || Naigama, Vyavahara and Sangraha Nayas accept all Bandhas. || 4 || Riju-Sutranaya does not accept Sthapanabandha. || 5 || Shabdnaya accepts Namabandha and Bhava-bandha. || 6 ||

The **Jiva-Bhava-Bandha** is of three types: **Vipakapacchayi Jiva-Bhava-Bandha**, **Avipakapacchayi Jiva-Bhava-Bandha**, and **Tadubhayapacchayi Jiva-Bhava-Bandha**. || 14 ||
The **Udaya** and **Udirana** of **Karma** is called **Vipaka**, and the **Upshama** or **Kshaya** of these in their absence is called **Avipaka**. The **Bhava** that arises due to **Vipaka** is called **Vipakapratyay**, and the **Bhava** that arises due to **Avipaka** is called **Avipakapratyay**. The **Bhava** that arises from the **Udaya** and **Udirana** of **Karma**, and also from their **Upshama** and **Kshaya**, should be known as **Tadubhayapratyay Jiva-Bhava-Bandha**.
The **Vipakapacchayi Jiva-Bhava-Bandha** is described as follows: **Deva-Bhava**, **Manushya-Bhava**, **Tiryanch-Bhava**, **Naraka-Bhava**, **Stri-Veda**, **Purusha-Veda**, **Napunsaka-Veda**, **Krodha-Veda**, **Mana-Veda**, **Maya-Veda**, **Lobha-Veda**, **Raga-Veda**, **Dosa-Veda**, **Moha-Veda**, **Krishna-Leshya**, **Nila-Leshya**, **Kapota-Leshya**, **Pita-Leshya**, **Padma-Leshya**, **Shukla-Leshya**, **Asanjat-Bhava**, **Avirat-Bhava**, **Agnana-Bhava**, and **Mithyadristi-Bhava**. Similarly, all other **Bhavas** that arise from **Karma-Udaya-Pratyayik Udaya-Vipaka** are **Vipakapratyayik Jiva-Bhava-Bandha**. || 15 ||
All the above **Bhavas**, such as **Deva-Naraka**, etc., arise from the **Udaya** of **Karma** such as **Vivakshit Deva-Gati Nama-Karma**, etc., hence they are called **Vipakapratyayik Jiva-Bhava-Bandha**.

**Bonding through the Yoga of Bonding**

[723
5,
6, 22]

**The bondage of the non-living**

**19.** This sutra means that the bondage of the non-living, which is caused by the yoga of bonding, is the bondage of the non-living that is caused by both the karma and the non-karma. This includes the Kshayopashmik Drishtivad, Kshayopashmik Gani, Kshayopashmik Vachan, Kshayopashmik Dashapurva, and Kshayopashmik Chaturdashapurvadhar, as well as all other Kshayopashmik emotions.

**20.** The bondage of the non-living is of three types: Vipakapratyayik Ajiva Bhava Bandha, Avipakapratyayik Ajiva Bhava Bandha, and Tadubhayapratyayik Ajiva Bhava Bandha.

**20.** The non-living emotions that arise due to Mithyatva, Aviriti, and other causes, or due to the efforts of the individual, are called Vipakapratyayik Ajiva Bhava Bandha. The non-living emotions that arise without the aforementioned causes are called Avipakapratyayik Ajiva Bhava Bandha. And the non-living emotions that arise due to both these causes are called Tadubhayapratyayik Ajiva Bhava Bandha.

**21.** The Vipakapratyayik Ajiva Bhava Bandha is characterized by the following:  PraYogaparinat Varna, PraYogaparinat Shabda, PraYogaparinat Gandha, PraYogaparinat Rasa, PraYogaparinat Sparsa, PraYogaparinat Gati, PraYogaparinat Avagahana, PraYogaparinat Sansthana, PraYogaparinat Skandha, PraYogaparinat Skandhadesa, and PraYogaparinat Skandhapradesa. All these, and other emotions that are combined with PraYogaparinat, are called Vipakapratyayik Ajiva Bhava Bandha.

**21.** The sutra means that the Vipakapratyayik Ajiva Bhava Bandha is the result of the emergence of the specific karma called Varna, which manifests as the Varna, Shabda, and other forms of Pudgala Parinam in the Audarik Skandha of the body. It also includes the Pudgala Parinam that arises from the use of turmeric and other substances, which manifests as the different shades of Varna.

**22.** The Avipakapratyayik Ajiva Bhava Bandha is characterized by the following:  Vissasa Parinat Varna, Vissasa Parinat Shabda, Vissasa Parinat Gandha, Vissasa Parinat Rasa, Vissasa Parinat Sparsa, Vissasa Parinat Gati, Vissasa Parinat Avagahana, Vissasa Parinat Sansthana, Vissasa Parinat Skandha, Vissasa Parinat Skandhadesa, and Vissasa Parinat Skandhapradesa. All these, and other emotions that are combined with Vissasa Parinat, are called Avipakapratyayik Ajiva Bhava Bandha.

The **Avipāka-pratyayika Ajīva-bhāva-bandha** is described as follows: **Vinasā-pariṇata** colour, **Visrasā-pariṇata** sound, **Visrasā-pariṇata** smell, **Visrasā-pariṇata** taste, **Vinasā-pariṇata** touch, **Vinasā-pariṇata** motion, **Visrasā-pariṇata** Avagāhana, **Visrasā-pariṇata** Santhāna, **Visrasā-pariṇata** Skandha, **Visrasā-pariṇata** Skandha-desa, and **Visrasā-pariṇata** Skandha-pradesa; these and all other similar **Visrasā-pariṇata** combined states are **Avipāka-pratyayika Ajīva-bhāva-bandha**. || 22 ||

The **Tadu-bhaya-paccaīya Ajīva-bhāva-bandha** is described as follows: **Prayoga-pariṇata** colour and **Visrasā-pariṇata** colour, **Prayoga-pariṇata** sound and **Visrasā-pariṇata** sound, **Prayoga-pariṇata** smell and **Visrasā-pariṇata** smell, **Prayoga-pariṇata** taste and **Visrasā-pariṇata** taste, **Prayoga-pariṇata** touch and **Visrasā-pariṇata** touch, **Prayoga-pariṇata** motion and **Visrasā-pariṇata** motion, [**Prayoga-pariṇata** Avagāhana and **Visrasā-pariṇata** Avagāhana], **Prayoga-pariṇata** Santhāna and **Visrasā-pariṇata** Santhāna, **Prayoga-pariṇata** Skandha and **Visrasā-pariṇata** Skandha, **Prayoga-pariṇata** Skandha-desa and **Visrasā-pariṇata** Skandha-desa, **Prayoga-pariṇata** Skandha-pradesa and **Visrasā-pariṇata** Skandha-pradesa; these and all other similar **Prayoga** and **Visrasā-pariṇata** combined states are **Tadu-bhaya-pratyayika Ajīva-bhāva-bandha**. || 23 ||

The meaning is that the combination and **Samvāya** relationship of **Visrasā-pariṇata** colour etc. with **Prayoga-pariṇata** colour etc. should be understood as **Tadu-bhaya-pratyayika Ajīva-bhāva-bandha**.

The **Dravya-bandha** that has been stopped is of two types: **Āgama-dravya-bandha** and **No-āgama-dravya-bandha**. || 24 ||

The section on the six divisions of the universe (Chhakhandagama)
[5, 6, 32]
From the half portion to the fourth portion is called the Dharmaastikadesha. The relationship of these Dharmaastikadeshas with their components should be known as Dharmaastikadeshabandha. From the fourth portion of the said Dharmaastikaya, the name of all the components is Dharmaastikapradesha and their mutual relationship is called Dharmaastikapradeshabandha. The same process should be known in relation to Adharmaastikaya and Aakaashaastikaya. The mutual relationship of the regions of these three Astikayas should be understood as Anadivisrasabandha.
The instruction for that which was called Sadivisrasabandha is as follows: dissimilar smoothness and dissimilar roughness are the cause of bondage. [32]
Here, the word Mada should be understood as similarity and the word Vimada should be understood as dissimilarity.
Similar smoothness and similar roughness are the cause of separation. [33]
The meaning is that smooth atoms do not bind with other smooth atoms and rough atoms do not bind with other rough atoms.
Smooth pudgala atoms do not bind with other smooth pudgala atoms. Similarly, rough pudgala atoms do not bind with other rough pudgala atoms. But similar and dissimilar smooth and rough pudgala atoms attain mutual bondage. [34]
The meaning is that smooth atoms with similar qualities do not bind with other smooth atoms and rough atoms with similar qualities do not bind with other rough atoms. But smooth and rough pudgala atoms, whether they are similar in terms of their form-quality-division-covering or dissimilar in terms of the said form-quality-division-covering, still bind with each other.
Two-quality smoothness and two-quality roughness are the cause of mutual bondage. [35]
The meaning is that smooth atoms which are two indivisible coverings more or less in their smoothness bind with each other. The same process should be known in the mutual bondage of rough atoms.

Bonding occurs between two particles with similar qualities, i.e., two smooth particles bond together, and two rough particles bond together. Similarly, bonding occurs between a smooth and a rough particle, whether they are of equal or unequal size, provided they are not completely separated. However, particles with inferior qualities do not bond under any circumstances. || 36 ||
The result of this bonding is the formation of various phenomena such as Abhra (unsuitable clouds for rain), Megha (clouds suitable for rain), Sandhya (twilight), Viddyut (lightning), Ulka (meteor), Kanaka (thunderbolt), Disadaha (fire in the sky), Dhoomakethu (comet), and Indradhanush (rainbow). These, along with other similar phenomena, are all considered to be the result of Sadi Visrasa Bandha. || 37 ||
The Thuppa (suspended) Bandha is of two types: Karma Bandha and No Karma Bandha. || 38 ||
Karma Bandha is the one that is currently suspended. || 39 ||
No Karma Bandha is of five types: Alavana Bandha, Alliva Bandha, Sansilesa Bandha, Sarira Bandha, and Sariri Bandha. || 40 ||
Alavana Bandha is characterized by the following: Sangada (gathering), Jana (knowing), Juga (joining), Gaddi (fixing), Gilli (rolling), Raha (staying), Sandana (connecting), Siviya (sewing), Giha (house), Pasada (palace),

[41]
The binding of forts, kudḍas, govarapīḍas, prākāras, and śāṭikās, as well as other substances that are bound together by other substances, is called allivana-bandho. [42]
The binding of carts, etc., in ālāvaṇabandho is done with the help of other substances like wood, iron, or rope, but in allivana-bandho, the binding of forts, etc., is done without the help of other substances. This difference should be understood.
The binding of wood and lac that are bound together by mutual contact is called saṁsileśabandho. [43]
Just as in ālāvaṇabandho, there is a need for other substances like iron and rope, and in allivana-bandho, there is a need for water, in saṁsileśabandho, there is no need for any other substance besides the substances being bound, like lac and wood. This is the special feature of this binding.
The binding of the body is of five types: audārikasarirabandho, vaikuṛiyikasarirabandho, āhārasarirabandho, taijasasarirabandho, and karmanīyasarirabandho. [44]

## Body-Bonding through Bandhana Yoga

**[729 Oral-Oral Body-Bonding || 45 ||]**
The bond between two Oral body-forms, composed of non-karmic pudgala skandhas, is called Oral-Oral Body-Bonding. || 45 ||
This is a single-combination, single-dissolution body-bond. 
**Oral-Tejas Body-Bonding || 46 || Oral-Karma Body-Bonding || 47 ||**
The bond between Oral body-form pudgala skandhas and Tejas body-form pudgala skandhas in the same jiva is called Oral-Tejas Body-Bonding. || 46 || The bond between Oral body-form pudgala skandhas and Karma body-form pudgala skandhas in the same jiva is called Oral-Karma Body-Bonding. || 47 ||

Thus, there are only two double-combination dissolutions. This is because the Oral body cannot bond with any other body except the Tejas and Karma bodies. Although the Oral body may be found with the Aharak body in humans, it is not considered here because the Oral body does not exist at that time.
**Oral-Tejas-Karma Body-Bonding || 48 ||**
The bond between Oral, Tejas, and Karma body-form skandhas in the same jiva is called Oral-Tejas-Karma Body-Bonding. This is a single triple-combination dissolution. || 48 ||

**Vaikriya-Vaikriya Body-Bonding || 49 || Vaikriya-Tejas Body-Bonding || 50 || Vaikriya-Karma Body-Bonding || 51 ||**
The bond between two Vaikriya body-forms, composed of pudgala skandhas, in the same jiva is called Vaikriya-Vaikriya Body-Bonding. || 49 || The bond between Vaikriya body-form pudgala skandhas and Tejas body-form pudgala skandhas in the same jiva is called Vaikriya-Tejas Body-Bonding. || 50 || The bond between Vaikriya body-form pudgala skandhas and Karma body-form pudgala skandhas in the same jiva is called Vaikriya-Karma Body-Bonding. || 51 ||

These are the three double-combination dissolutions related to the Vaikriya body. 
**Vaikriya-Tejas-Karma Body-Bonding || 52 ||**
The bond between Vaikriya, Tejas, and Karma body-form skandhas in the same jiva is called Vaikriya-Tejas-Karma Body-Bonding. || 52 ||

**So savvo sarira-bandho nāma**. || 60 || All the aforementioned are **śarīra-bandha**. || 60 ||

**Jo so sarira-bandho nāma so duviho - sādiya-sarira-bandho ceva aṇādiya-sarira-bandho ceva**. || 61 ||

The **śarīra-bandha** is of two types - **sādiya-śarīra-bandha** and **aṇādiya-śarīra-bandha**. || 61 ||

**Jo so sādiya-sarira-bandho nāma so jahā sarira-bandho tahāṇedavyo**. || 62 ||

The **sādiya-śarīra-bandha** should be understood as similar to the **śarīra-bandha**. || 62 ||

Here is the translation of the provided text into English, while keeping the Sanskrit words intact:

5, 2, 67] In the context of bondage (bandhaṇāṇiyogaddāre), the body-bond (śarīrabandhapurūvāṇā) is discussed. 

[731] The term "śarīrī" refers to the living being (jīva) that possesses a body (śarīra). The bond that exists with the various types of bodies, such as the *audārik* and the *vaikṛtik*, should be known as the body-bond (śarīrabandha). The characteristics of its dissolution (bhaṅga) are similar to that of the body-bond (śarīrabandha). For example, the bondage (bandha) with the *audārik* body, the bondage with the *vaikṛtik* body, etc.

The bondage named "anādiyasarīrībhañḍo" exists in such a way that it becomes an attachment among the eight *madhyapradeśa* (middle regions) of the jīvas, and the bonds with other regions (*aṇṇoṇṇa-pade-sabandho*) are also included; this is all considered an anādiyasarīrībhañḍo. 

This anādiyasarīrībhañḍo occurs in such a manner that there is mutual regional bondage among the eight middle regions of the living beings (jīvas) from an eternal time (anādikāla). Likewise, the embodied beings (śarīra-dhārī) are generally bound with karma (kamma) and non-karma (nokamma) since time immemorial (anādi kāla). This should be understood as an anādī śarīrabandha. 

The term "thappo" refers to the karma-bandha which has been temporarily suspended (thappo kammbhando). Its characteristics (prarūpaṇa) should be understood in the context of the karma anuyoga (kamma anuyogadvāra). 

Thus ends the exposition on bondage (bandhakī prarūpaṇa). 

2. In the description of bondage (bandhagāṇiyogaddāra), those who are called "bandhakāḥ" (bonded ones) are illustrated as follows: *gamana* (movement), *indriya* (senses), *kāya* (body), *yoga* (union), *veda* (scriptures), *kṣaya* (passions), *jñāna* (knowledge), *saṃyama* (self-control), *darśana* (perception), *leśyā* (psychic states), *bhavyatva* (spiritual potential), *samyaktva* (right perception), *sañjñī* (name), and *āhāra* (food). 

The metaphorical expression derived from *gati* (movement) states that beings who are in the naraka (hell) realm are bound (bandhaka), beings in the tiryanch (animal) realm are bound, divine beings (*deva*) are bound, human beings (*manuṣya*) are bound, and unbound beings (*abhandha*) also exist, while the *siddha* (liberated beings) are unbound too. In this manner, one should understand the characteristics similar to the eleven pathways of *kṣullaka bandha* (minor bondage). 

Similarly, it should be understood that there is a concept of *mahādanda* (great punishment or bondage). 

Thus ends the exposition on bondages (bandhakāṇī prarūpaṇa).

Chapter on Classification in the Six-Angled Doctrine
[5, 3, 68
3. The following is the way to understand what is to be bound: the karmic matter is in the form of pain, the karmic matter in the form of pain is in the form of aggregates, and the aggregates are in the form of classifications. || 68 ||
In the explanation of classifications, the following eight categories of knowledge are to be known: classification, classification of substance, immediate cause, remote cause, action, time, definition, and fewness and manyness. || 69 ||
Now, in the explanation of the first category of knowledge, classification, the following sixteen categories of knowledge are to be explained: classification by name, classification by definition, classification by form, classification by non-form, classification by constant and non-constant, classification by continuous and discontinuous, classification by strength and weakness, classification by field, classification by contact, classification by time, classification by space, classification by absence, classification by application, classification by measure, classification by parts, and classification by fewness and manyness. || 70 ||
Now, the chapter on classification. In this, the following sixteen categories of knowledge are to be known: classification by name, classification by definition, classification by form, classification by non-form, classification by constant and non-constant, classification by continuous and discontinuous, classification by strength and weakness, classification by field, classification by contact, classification by time, classification by space, classification by absence, classification by application, classification by measure, classification by parts, and classification by fewness and manyness. || 70 ||
Now, the chapter on classification by name. This classification by name is of six types: classification by name, classification by establishment, classification by substance, classification by field, classification by time, and classification by state. || 71 ||
Now, the chapter on classification by definition. Which classification is desired? All classifications are desired, including the classification of action. || 72 ||

Page #858:
---------------------------
[5, 3, 80] The topic of the classification of substances through the door of the binding principle.
[733] This is the chapter on the discussion of the classification of substances. Which principle accepts which classification? The principles of Naigama, Vyavahara and Sangraha accept all classifications. || 72 ||
The principle of Ujusudo does not accept the classification of two. || 73 || The principle of Rjusutra does not accept the classification of establishment. || 73 || The principle of Saddana accepts the classification of name and the classification of essence. || 74 || The principle of Shabdana accepts the classification of name and the classification of essence. || 74 ||
The topic of the classification of substances is discussed here. There are fourteen doors of the principle in this: classification-form, classification-non-form, classification-stable-unstable-following, classification-different-continuous-following, classification-power-pair-following, classification-field-following, classification-touch-following, classification-time-following, classification-interval-following, classification-essence-following, classification-application-following, classification-quantity-following, classification-part-part-following and classification-less-more-following. || 75 ||
The classification of one-region-atomic-pudgala-substance is called the classification of form. || 76 || This is the classification of two-region-atomic-pudgala-substance. || 77 ||
Thus, there are classifications of three-region, four-region, five-region, six-region, seven-region, eight-region, nine-region, ten-region, countable-region, uncountable-region, limited-region, unlimited-region, infinite-region and infinite-infinite-region atomic-pudgala-substance. || 78 ||
The classification of infinite-infinite-region atomic-pudgala-substance is called the classification of food-substance. || 79 ||
The classification of food-substance is called the classification of non-food-substance. || 80 ||

Chapter on the Group of Sixfold Categories
[5, 3, 121
This is the characteristic of the common [sāhārana] [121]
The common food and the common inhalation-exhalation are the characteristics of the common beings. [122]
The meaning is that in the same body, the infinite beings, in which the food of all is taken by one being, and the inhalation-exhalation of all is taken by one being, are called common plant-bodied beings.
The appropriation of one being, that is, the appropriation of the pudgala atoms for the production of the perfections, is the appropriation of many common beings, and it is also the appropriation of this one being, and the appropriation of many is the appropriation of this intended being, and also of every other being. [123]
The birth of the body of the infinite beings born in succession in the same nigoda body is simultaneous, the appropriation is simultaneous, and the inhalation-exhalation is also simultaneous. [124]
Where one being dies, there is the death of infinite beings, and where one being is born, there is the birth of infinite beings. [125]
The badara nigoda being and the subtle nigoda being are bound and touch each other. And they (badara) are infinite beings, due to the root, the stem, and the moistness, etc. [126]
There are infinite beings who have not attained the trasas paryayas in the past. They do not abandon the nigoda dwelling due to the abundance of extreme defilements. [127]

Page #864:
---------------------------
[5, 3, 131]  Binding through the Anuyoga Dwara, the Comparison with Nigoda Bodies
[739  In a single Nigoda body, the number of Jivas is seen to be infinitely greater than the number of Siddhas in all of the past time. || 128 ||
There are two types of Nigoda Jivas: Chatur-Gati Nigoda Jivas and Nitya Nigoda Jivas. Those Jivas who are born in the realms of Devas, Narakas, Tiryanchas, and Humans and then return to the Nigoda state are called Chatur-Gati Nigoda Jivas. And those Jivas who always remain in the Nigoda state are called Nitya Nigoda Jivas. The Nitya Nigoda Jivas have such an abundance of karmic afflictions that they can never leave the Nigoda state and attain the Trasa Paryaya. The bodies of these Nigoda Jivas are countless in number, and in each of these bodies, there are infinite Jivas, whose number is infinitely greater than the number of Siddhas in all of the past time. This is why, even though six hundred and eight Jivas attain liberation every six months and eight times, there is never a shortage of worldly Jivas. The reason for this is that those numbers which are finite and infinite are called finite and infinite because they can be destroyed when they are depleted. And those numbers which are infinite and cannot be destroyed even when they are depleted, are called infinite. Since there are infinite Jivas in each of these countless Nigoda bodies, the number of worldly Jivas can never be exhausted, even though they are constantly being depleted. This is the meaning of the above two Sutras.
According to this verse, the following Anuyoga Dwaras are to be known: Satya-Rupana, Dravya-Pramana-Anugam, Kshetra-Anugam, Sparsha-Anugam, Kala-Anugam, Antara-Anugam, Bhava-Anugam, and Alpa-Bahutva-Anugam. || 129 ||
There are two types of Satya-Rupana: Ogha-Nidesha and Aadesha-Nidesha. || 130 ||
There are Jivas with two bodies, three bodies, four bodies, and those without bodies. || 131 ||
Since the Jivas in the state of Vigraha-Gati have only two bodies, Taijasa and Karmana, they are referred to here as "Dwisharira". Those Jivas who have three bodies, Audarika, Taijasa, and Karmana, or Vaikriyika, Taijasa, and Karmana, are called "Trisharira", and...

[740]  Chhakkanḍagame Vaggaṇā-khaṇḍa
[5, 3, 132]  One should know that beings combined with the four bodies - Audārika, Vaikriyika, Taijasa and Kārmaṇa, or Audārika, Āhārika, Taijasa and Kārmaṇa - are known as Chatuḥśarīra.
According to the Ādesa, in the Gadiyāṇuvāda, there are beings with two bodies (in the Vigrahātimi) and three bodies in the Narakagati, not in the Gaireyasu. || 132 ||
Similarly, in the seven Pṛthvīs, the Narakas in the Vigrahāgati should be known as having two bodies and then three bodies. || 133 ||
In the Tiryanchagati, the flow of the natural form is the same for the Tiryancha, Panchendriya Tiryancha, Panchendriya Tiryanchapariyapta, and Panchendriya Tiryanchayonini beings. || 134 ||
The Panchendriya Tiryancha apariyapta beings have two bodies and three bodies, but four bodies are not possible in them. || 135 ||
In the Manushagati, the flow of the natural form is the same for the ordinary Manusya, Manusya pariyapta, and Manusyanis. || 136 ||
The Manusya apariyapta beings have two bodies and three bodies. || 137 ||
In the Devagati, the Devas have two bodies and three bodies. || 138 ||
Similarly, from the Bhavanavāsīs to the Sarvārthāsiddhi Vimānavāsī Devas, one should know.
According to the Indriyāṇuvāda, the flow of the natural form is the same for the Ekendriya, Bādar Ekendriya, and their pariyapta beings, as well as the Panchendriya and Panchendriya pariyapta beings. || 140 ||

[744] In the Chakkhandagama, the section on the relative abundance of beings
[5, 3, 168] There are two types of indication regarding the relative abundance of beings: Oga-nidesha and Aadesha-nidesha. || 168 ||
Oga-nidesha means that in all beings, those with four bodies are the least abundant. || 169 || Those with no bodies are infinitely more abundant than those with four bodies. || 170 || Those with two bodies are infinitely more abundant than those with four bodies. || 171 || Those with three bodies are innumerably more abundant than those with four bodies. || 172 ||
Aadesha-nidesha means that in the context of the path of liberation, in the hellish realm, those with two bodies are the least abundant. || 173 || Those with three bodies are innumerably more abundant than those with two bodies. || 174 ||
This same principle applies to all seven realms of existence. || 175 ||
In the context of the animal realm, the relative abundance of beings is similar to the Oga-nidesha. || 176 ||
Among the five-sense animals, the five-sense animals with sufficient karma, and the five-sense animals with the potential for liberation, those with four bodies are the least abundant. || 177 || Those with two bodies are innumerably more abundant than those with four bodies. || 178 || Those with three bodies are innumerably more abundant than those with four bodies. || 179 ||
The relative abundance of the five-sense animals with insufficient karma is similar to that of the hellish beings. || 180 ||
In the context of the human realm, the relative abundance of beings is similar to that of the five-sense animals. || 181 ||
Among the humans with sufficient karma and the human females, those with four bodies are the least abundant. || 182 || Those with two bodies are numerably more abundant than those with four bodies. || 183 || Those with three bodies are numerably more abundant than those with four bodies. || 184 ||

[5, 3, 196] Through the yoga of bondage, the manifestation of the body and the body-like is the manifestation of the many-few. The human being is like the five-sense-less. || 185 ||
The manifestation of the human being is like the five-sense-less, like the five-sense-less of the Tiryanch. || 185 ||
The gods of the Devloka are the most deficient in all respects, having two bodies. || 186 ||
Those with three bodies are countless times more numerous. || 187 ||
Thus, it should be known that the manifestation of the many-few is from the dwellers of the Bhavan to the gods who dwell in the Aparajita Vimanas. || 188 ||
The gods who dwell in the Sarvarthasiddhi Vimanas are the most deficient in all respects, having two bodies. || 189 ||
Those with three bodies are countless times more numerous. || 190 ||
According to the Indriya-vada, the manifestation of the one-sense-less, the two-sense-less, and the three-sense-less is like a stream. || 191 ||
The two-sense-less, the subtle one-sense-less, and their sufficient and insufficient, as well as the two-sense-less, the three-sense-less, the four-sense-less, and their sufficient and insufficient, and the five-sense-less, are the most deficient in all respects, having two bodies. || 192 ||
Those with three bodies are countless times more numerous. || 193 ||
The manifestation of the five-sense-less and the five-sense-less is like the human being. || 194 ||
According to the Kaya-vada, the earth-bodied, the water-bodied, the plant-bodied, the Nigoda-jiva, and their subsequent, subtle, sufficient and insufficient; the external plant-bodied, each body and their sufficient and insufficient; the external water-bodied, the external earth-bodied, and their sufficient and insufficient; the subtle water-bodied, the subtle earth-bodied, and their sufficient and insufficient; the subtle earth-bodied, and their sufficient and insufficient; are the most deficient in all respects, having two bodies. || 195 ||
Those with three bodies are countless times more numerous. || 196 ||

With respect to name-explanation, the one who is vast in understanding is called the generous body. || 237 ||
According to the explanation, 'Generous is indeed generous', the body which is vast - greater than other bodies in understanding - is called the generous body.

**Padmimamsa** is now the topic. There are two **Anuyogadwaras** in it - **Jghannyapad** and **Ukkassapad**. || 416 ||
With respect to **Ukkassapad**, whose **Oralia Sarira** has the **Ukkassayam** (highest point)? || 417 || The answer is - **Uttarakuru** and **Devakuru** among the **Manu** who has three **Paly** of lifespan. || 418 ||
Further, in 10 sutras, the characteristics of the said **Manu** are explained. He is **Padhamasamayaahar** (one who takes food at the first time), born from **Rjugati** (straight path), and **Tadbhavatha** (one who has attained the state of **Tadbhavatha**). He takes food by **Ukkassayoga** (highest yoga) at the first time of **Tadbhavatha**. || 419 ||
He grows by **Ukkassiya** (highest growth). || 420 || He is satisfied by all **Pajattis** (satisfactions) through the **Antomuhurta** (shortest time). || 421 ||
His **Bhaasaddhao** (time of speech) is short. || 422 || His **Manajogaddhao** (time of thinking) is short. || 423 || He has few **Chhavi Chheda** (actions that cause pain to the body). || 424 ||
He does not undergo any **Viuvido** (change) in the middle of his lifespan of three **Paly**. || 425 ||
When there is a small remainder of his lifespan, he remains for the **Antomuhurta** (shortest time) above the **Yogayavam** (yoga body). || 426 ||
In the last **Jivagunahanisthana** (stages of loss of life qualities), he remains for the time equal to an **Asankhyejjadibhaga** (incalculable part) of **Avalia** (a unit of time). || 427 ||

It should be known that in the last moment of life, the minimum extent of the kārmaṇa śarīra of the jīva who attains final liberation is as follows:

Tavvadirittamajahanaṃ: Its non-minimum extent is different from the minimum extent. (495)

Appābahue ti sarvvatthovvaṃ orāliyasarīrassa padesakkaṃ: Compared to the less and more, the extent of the physical (audārika) body is the smallest. (496)

Veuṃciyasarīrassa padesakkamasaṃkhejjaguṇaṃ: The extent of the karmic (kārmaṇa) body is asaṃkhyāta (innumerable) times greater. (497)

Āhārasarīrassa padesakkamasaṃkhejjaguṇaṃ: The extent of the transformable (vaikriyika) body is asaṃkhyāta times greater. (498)

Teyāsarīrassa padesakkamaṇantaguṇaṃ: The extent of the fiery (taijasa) body is ananta (infinite) times greater. (499)

Kammaiyasarīrassa padesakkamaṇantaguṇaṃ: The extent of the karmic (kārmaṇa) body is ananta times greater. (500)

In the description of the increase in the size of the body, there are six anuyogadvāras: avibhāgapratichhedaprarupanā, vargaṇāprarupanā, sparddhāprarupanā, antaraprarupanā, sarīraprarupanā, and appābahue ti.

**Chapter on the Classification of the Six Realms (Chhakkanḍāgama)**

**Section on the Classification of the Realms (Vaggṇā-khaṇḍa)**

[54, 507]
**The number of realms (phaḍḍaya) is infinite, due to the infinite qualities of the liberated souls (siddhā) and the infinite parts of the liberated souls (siddhāṇam aṇanta bhāgo).** [507] **Thus, the number of realms (phaḍḍaya) is infinite, due to the infinite qualities of the liberated souls (siddhā) and the infinite parts of the liberated souls (siddhāṇam aṇanta bhāgo).** [508]
[772]
**In terms of the classification of the realms (phaḍḍaya), the infinite realms (phaḍḍaya) are all combined into one realm (phaḍḍaya) due to the infinite qualities of the liberated souls (siddhā) and the infinite parts of the liberated souls (siddhāṇam aṇanta bhāgo).** [507] **In this way, in each of the realms (phaḍḍaya) of the subtle body (audārika śarīra), there are infinite realms (phaḍḍaya) due to the infinite qualities of the liberated souls (siddhā) and the infinite parts of the liberated souls (siddhāṇam aṇanta bhāgo).** [508]

**What is the difference between each realm (phaḍḍaya)?** [509] **The difference is infinite times the number of all living beings (savva jīva).** [510]

**In terms of the classification of the realms (phaḍḍaya), what is the difference between each realm (phaḍḍaya)?** [509] **The difference is only due to the infinite number of indivisible divisions (avibhāga paḍicchedā) of all living beings (savva jīva).** [510] **This is the difference.** [510]

**In terms of the classification of the realms (phaḍḍaya), the aforementioned infinite indivisible divisions (avibhāga paḍicchedā) are produced by the intellect (buddhi) cutting through the qualities (guṇa) that bind the body (śarīra).** [511]

**There are ten types of cutting (chedanā).** [512]

**Generally, there are ten types of cutting (chedanā).** [512] **For example:**

**Name cutting (nāma chedanā), establishment cutting (sthāpanā chedanā), substance cutting (dravya chedanā), body-binding quality cutting (śarīra bandhana guṇa chedanā), region cutting (pradeśa chedanā), vine cutting (vallari chedanā), atom cutting (aṇu chedanā), edge cutting (taṭa chedanā), origin cutting (utpāda chedanā), and ignorance cutting (prajñā bhāva chedanā).** [513] **Thus, there are ten types of cutting (chedanā).** [513]

**The indivisible divisions (avibhāga paḍicchedā) of the subtle body (audārika śarīra) are the smallest.** [514] **The indivisible divisions (avibhāga paḍicchedā) of the changing body (uvva śarīra) are infinite times greater.** [515] **The indivisible divisions (avibhāga paḍicchedā) of the food body (āhāra śarīra) are infinite times greater.** [516] **The indivisible divisions (avibhāga paḍicchedā) of the luminous body (teyaśarīra) are infinite times greater.** [517] **The indivisible divisions (avibhāga paḍicchedā) of the karma body (karmaiya śarīra) are infinite times greater.** [518]

**In terms of the classification of the realms (phaḍḍaya), how many realms (phaḍḍaya) are there in each living being (jīva)?** [519]

[781] Those who are the nigodas that have arisen by the minimum duration of arising and have become bound by the minimum duration of bondage, their release occurs by the order of death of those bound bādara nigodas. || 630 ||

The nigodas that have arisen by the minimum duration of arising and have become bound by the minimum duration of bondage, their release occurs by the order of death of those bound bādara nigodas in that manner. || 630 ||

The measure of the nigodas remaining at the time of death of those who have died by the supreme series of qualities and have become free from attachment after a very long time, is the infinitesimal part of an āvalī. || 631 ||

Here, the least is the smallest comprehension of the bhavagraha. || 632 ||

The minimum cessation of the one-sensed is innumerable times greater. || 633 || That very one is the superior, the special. || 634 ||

The measure of the nigodas in the minimum bādara nigoda-vargaṇā is the infinitesimal part of an āvalī. || 635 ||

The measure of the nigodas in the minimum sūkṣma nigoda-vargaṇā is the infinitesimal part of an āvalī. || 636 ||
