The birth of Shri Parsamalji, son of the revered Utsavrajji Choudhary and Smt. Bhanwari Baiji Choudhary, on the auspicious day of Paush Badi 10, VS 2029, was like the first rays of the sun, blessing the spiritual realm. 

From childhood, Shri Parsamalji was intelligent, detached, sociable, pure of heart, and gentle in his conduct. He became a great traveler on the path of renunciation, austerity, knowledge, and spiritual practice. On Magh Sudi 10, VS 2044, he received the Arhati Diksha in Bijaynagar and became 'Muni Sudarshan', a beloved disciple of the revered Acharya Pravar Shri Sohनलालji M. Sa.

A symbol of meditation and spiritual practice, a source of inspiration for pure character, a tranquil ocean of harmony, a messenger of the message of Sarvodaya Tirth, Shri Sudarshan Muni Ji, the Shaasanagaurav, earned immense fame as a guardian of the five principles of non-violence and a successful preacher of Dharma.

He gained the title of a skilled interpreter of abstract subjects by deeply studying languages like Hindi, Sanskrit, Prakrit, and subjects like grammar, logic, philosophy, Agam, and literary studies. He became the architect of service, organization, and spiritual practice, and the center of faith for the people. He connected youth with Samayik Swadhyay, earning their devotion. He expanded his knowledge by deeply studying Agamic commentaries.

From the 6th of Maatra Badi, VS 2055, he took on the weighty responsibility of the Acharya पद, making the titles of 'Shaasanagaurav' and 'Yuva Manishi' meaningful. He became a bridge between youth, adults, and the elderly, and a respected and memorable figure as an inexhaustible treasure of good conduct, good thoughts, and good morals.

**Dedication**

O Messenger of Revolution,

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra (Published)

India has always been a land of religion. Here, the traditions of the Shramanas and the Brahmanas have been dominant. The Brahmanical tradition followed the Vedas - the Veda was its primary scripture, while the scriptures of the Buddhists within the Shraman tradition were called 'Pitaka' and the scriptures of the Jains were called 'Agam'.

Of the Agams available today, the eleven Anga Shastras were taught by Lord Mahavira and compiled by his chief disciples - the Ganadharas. The main area of Lord Mahavira's travels was the Magadha country (present-day Bihar state), so it was natural for these Agams to be compiled in the Ardhamagadhi language used there. For a long time after Mahavira, this Agam knowledge remained safe in the Shruta tradition, but gradually, due to memory weakness, errors began to creep in. Therefore, during the time of Devarddigni Kshamashraman, all the Agam literature was written down.

To clarify and explain in detail all the principles and teachings described in the Agams, later Acharyas wrote Churnis, Bhashyas and Tikas. The Tika literature was in Sanskrit, which, due to its grammatical complexity, became inaccessible to the common people over time - its reading and study became less and less. As a result, many Sadhus, Sadhvis, Shravaks and Shravikas were unable to fulfill their desire to know the Agamic principles. Due to their lack of knowledge of Sanskrit and Prakrit, they found it difficult to understand the essence of the Agams.

Reverend Vallabhmuni Ji M.Sa., the Prabhakar of Pravachans, felt this particular lack while teaching his resident small Munis and obedient Sadhvis. A thought arose in his mind: why not translate these Sanskrit Tikas into the national language Hindi, which could be enjoyed by all? At that time, there was a stir in his thought world. He also had the Tikas compiled for the fulfillment of the goal, but due to his untimely demise, this thought could not take concrete form in his lifetime.

Thereafter, Acharya Pravara Reverend Sudarshanlal Ji M.Sa. and the eloquent speaker Reverend Priyadarshanmuni Ji M.Sa., while studying with the renowned scholar Shriman Dr. Chaganlal Ji Sa. Shastri, also felt this lack and presented their idea of translating these Tikas into Hindi to the Swadhyaya-Shiromani, Reverend Acharya Pravara Shri Sohनलाल Ji M.Sa. Reverend Acharya Pravara, recognizing the importance of this work, granted permission to publish the translations of the Tikas written by Sheelankacharya and Abhaydev Suri of the eleven Anga Shastras.

This is the fruit of the blessings of Reverend Acharya Pravara Shri Sohनलाल Ji M.Sa. and the hard work of the present Acharya Shri Sudarshanlal Ji M.Sa. and the eloquent speaker Reverend Priyadarshanmuni Ji M.Sa., that the work was started immediately as planned and, under the advice and guidance of the learned scholar Reverend Dr. Chaganlal Ji Sa. Shastri, the translation of the Tika written by Sheelankacharya of the first Shruta Skandha of the Sutra Kritanga Sutra has come to light. We are immensely happy to dedicate this to the readers of the Agam.

## The Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra
(Editorial Note)

The Jain Agamas hold an extraordinary significance in the religious and spiritual literature of the world from many perspectives. This is a very ancient literature that records the vibrant journey of the upward-moving consciousness of humanity. It contains the story of the pursuit and attainment of supreme peace, not finding true peace in material wealth, splendor, and luxury. It is through this that weary humanity experienced the realization of oneself and the Supreme Being, experiencing unparalleled detachment and peaceful emotions.

These Agamas contain a detailed account of both worldly and otherworldly life. From an otherworldly perspective, they depict the sacred emotions of vows, restraint, truth, non-violence, non-possession, contentment, etc., while also containing a detailed history of human life spanning thousands of years. From both spiritual and worldly perspectives, they contain abundant material for study. This significance and utility is the reason why many Acharyas and wise saints after Bhagwan Mahavira have produced a vast amount of commentary, analysis, and explanatory literature on the Agamas in the form of commentaries, interpretations, summaries, and annotations. The Sanskrit commentaries written on the Agamas are of great importance from the perspective of multifaceted analysis and clarification of the principles enunciated and indicated in the Agamas.

It is a matter of great joy that there has been a widespread dissemination of knowledge in the field of study. Some time ago, people were not interested in studying the literature of other religions besides their own accepted religion. This is not the case today. People have developed an interest in studying other philosophies and religious principles. In many universities and institutes, a group of researchers is engaged in research on Jain philosophy, culture, religion, Agamas, etc. Jain Chairs have been established in many universities. Departments of Jain Studies are running in educational centers like Madras University, Udaipur University, Magadh University, etc., where students and researchers are engaged in study and research. This is a favorable time when world-renowned ideas based on many principles of Jain philosophy can be made scholarly and accessible to the public, so high-quality Jain literature should come to light.

There is a lot of publication of literature in the present time, but there is very little literature related to the Agamas and the Agamas. There is a great need for Agamic literature to understand philosophy and principles, but due to less interest in Agamic literature, general literature full of stories, discourses, hymns, etc., is more visible, or it can be said that unnecessary things are being encouraged more than necessary.

It was the heartfelt desire of our revered Acharya, the worshipful Gurudev Shri Sohनलाल जी म.सा., and the discourse luminary, the worshipful Vallabhmuni जी म.सा., that we should have the Agamas along with the Agamic commentaries.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

The Sutra Kritanga Sutra was studied. After the passing of revered Gurudev Shri Vallabhmuni Ji M.Sa., my feelings were expressed to the eminent scholar Dr. Chaganlal Ji Shastri. Dr. Shastriji readily accepted the heartfelt and emotional outpouring of Gurudev and dedicated himself to teaching. The study began with the commentary on the Sutra Kritanga Sutra by Acharya Sheelank. This commentary analyzes the Agam from a philosophical perspective. The commentator, taking the basis of ancient Niyukti and Churni literature, has clarified and strengthened the profound subject of Agam with new arguments. In fact, this commentary by Acharya Sheelank is unique for understanding a philosophical Agam like the Sutra Kritanga.

During the study, I had the idea that special work should be done on the eleven Angas, which are the primary sources of Jain knowledge. In this regard, I discussed this with the eminent scholar, a profound student of Jain Agam-Darshan, Shriyut Dr. Chaganlal Ji Shastri, who has been involved in our teaching and continues to be so. He found my idea very appropriate and beneficial. We also discussed this with all our Sadhus and Sadhvis.

As a result of this brainstorming, it seemed appropriate to all that the commentaries of Acharya Sheelank on the Acharang and Sutra Kritanga Sutras, and the commentaries of Abhaydev Suri on the remaining nine Angas, be published in Hindi translation. Hindi is the national language of India, and most people in the country speak, write, and read in this language. In North India and Central India, almost all universities offer higher education in Hindi medium. Literature published in Hindi can be used by everyone.

Therefore, on the auspicious occasion of Akshaya Tritiya, in the memory of Swadhyaya Shiromani Ashukaviratna, Agam Varidhi, Paramaraadhya Acharya Pravar Pujya Gurudev Shri Sohनलाल Ji M.Sa., at the Super Sincotex India Ltd. Mills of Shri Bhimsingh Ji Sancheti, it was decided to publish the Hindi translation of these commentaries. This important work was found very useful by the scholarly world, and it gave us a sense of satisfaction.

In the Ajmer Chaturmas of Samvat 2055, we had the desire to have Shriyut Dr. Chaganlal Ji Shastri's presence for all four months for study. It gives us a sense of spiritual joy to express that Dr. Shastriji, setting aside his other programs, gave us four months of his time. Our study continued, and Dr. Shastriji and Muni Priyadarshan Ji undertook the translation of the commentary by Acharya Sheelank on the first Shruta Skandha of the Sutra Kritanga Sutra. The work was very extensive, and we wondered if it could be completed within the Chaturmas period. But by the grace of Paramaraadhya Gurudev Shri and the tireless efforts of Muni Priyadarshan Ji, this work was completed in a very appropriate manner.

---------------------------
This translation of the Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra is presented as a glimpse into the study. The study should not be limited to oneself, but should also be helpful for other seekers of Agamas. Therefore, an attempt has been made to prepare the translation in a written form along with making it heart-felt. This translation is the result of the hard work of Shri Priyadarshan Muni Ji, who is helpful in Sangha Seva, and Dr. Chaganlal Ji Shastri, who is helpful in Shruta Aradhana. By working towards this, you have done an unparalleled work of Shruta Aradhana, for which they deserve heartfelt congratulations. And in the future too, the same expectation is from both of them that they continue to move forward in Shruta Aradhana in the form of study and teaching.
As I got the opportunity, I read the entire translation from beginning to end and also gave necessary instructions and comments. I am very pleased to write that the translation is in modern, clear Hindi and in a refined style. Those who read with the Sanskrit commentary will benefit greatly from it, and the translation has been done in such a flowing style that even Hindi readers will be able to assimilate the Agamic secrets revealed by the commentator.
This book will prove to be a strong support for the inquisitive people of the spiritual world. It will serve as an unparalleled provision in the great journey of the soul towards Nirvana.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra
### Introduction

Humanity has been in pursuit of ultimate truth for a long time. Material pleasures, comforts, worldly achievements, wealth, prosperity, and other attractive elements have always been pursued by humans, and they continue to be pursued even today. However, they have not been able to provide complete satisfaction, ultimate peace, supreme happiness, or uninterrupted bliss. Even after attaining all these things, humans have felt incomplete and unsatisfied.

This is because, while these things may seem appealing on the surface, they ultimately prove to be bland, contradictory, or prone to suffering. As contemplation progressed, humans sought a divine spiritual joy that is absolute and entirely self-sufficient. There, all disparities, adversities, and cycles of suffering are left behind, and liberation from them is achieved. This is what is called liberation or moksha. Thinkers and practitioners progressed further and further in the direction of attaining it. They adopted Dharma as a means to achieve it. Dharma has been interpreted in many ways. The nature of the soul is Dharma, the one who saves a being fallen into misery is Dharma, the one that leads to worldly prosperity and liberation is Dharma. This practical analysis is included in the Shruti and the harmony of character, good conduct, and Dharma.

In the world, Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha are considered the four Purusharthas. No matter who you look at, they are seen striving around these four. These four can be divided into two pairs: Artha and Kama, and Dharma and Moksha. Artha and Kama are entirely worldly or material, while Dharma and Moksha are spiritual or transcendental. When Artha and Kama are disciplined and controlled by Dharma and Moksha, they adopt a direction that leads them towards creation instead of destruction. This is the essence of the philosophical discussions, speculations, contemplations, and deliberations associated with Dharma. Where it progressed with this emotional ground, it spread peace, universal brotherhood, equality, and harmony in the world. Where this ideal was abandoned and mobility was based on narrow and selfish ideologies, there were bloody conflicts and disturbances in the name of Dharma, which can be called the dark pages of the history of righteousness.

India has been a predominantly religious country for a long time. Vedic, Jain, and Buddhist are the main religions here. They have their own scriptures, their own views, and their own codes of conduct. The Vedic tradition followers accept the Vedas as their ultimate authoritative scriptures. The word Veda is derived from the root "vid", which means knowledge. The Vedas contain many topics related to worldly and otherworldly knowledge, explained in hymns and mantras. Vedic followers do not consider the Rig, Yajur, Sama, and Atharva, this tetrad, to be man-made. They call them Apaurusheya, meaning they are not the creations of any particular person. The Supreme Father, the Supreme God, revealed the knowledge in the hearts of the Rishis, which manifested in the form of various hymns and mantras. Therefore, the Rishis are not called Mantra-srashta (creators of mantras), but Mantra-drashta (seers of mantras).

The oldest scriptures of the Buddhists are called Pitakas. They are known as Vinaya Pitaka, Sutta Pitaka, and Abhidhamma Pitaka. These are taught by the Tathagata Buddha. According to Buddhist followers, Buddha was an Arhat or an omniscient being.

---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** is an ancient scripture of Jainism, known as **Agamas**. The word **Agama** refers to a specific stream of knowledge that has been passed down for a long time. **Agamas** are spoken by **Sarvagna Tirthankaras**, a long chain of **Tirthankaras** divided into units of twenty-four, connected to the **Utsarpini** and **Avasarpini** periods. The **twenty-fourth** and final **Tirthankara** of the current **Avasarpini**, **Lord Mahavira**, delivered the teachings that we have received in the form of **Jain Agamas**.

**Lord Mahavira's** main area of work was the region that is primarily part of present-day **Bihar**. At that time, the main languages spoken in North India were **Magadhi, Ardha Magadhi, and Shaurseni Prakrit**. **Magadhi Prakrit** was prevalent in **Magadh**, the southern part of **Bihar**. **Shaurseni Prakrit** was prevalent in the western part of North India, extending to the **Vraj Mandal** or **Mathura**. The language between **Magadhi** and **Shaurseni** was called **Ardha Magadhi**, which had characteristics of both **Magadhi** and **Shaurseni**. Therefore, it was a language that could be understood by people living in **Magadhi, Shaurseni**, and the intervening areas. It was a kind of **lingua franca** of the Prakrit region, which is called **Lingua-Fvanca** in linguistics. **Lord Mahavira** used **Ardha Magadhi** in his teachings. This is specifically mentioned in the **Samavayanga Sutra**.

The **Dasha Vaikalik Vritti** also states that **Tattvadarshis** (philosophers) presented the principles in **Prakrit** to benefit children, women, elders, and ignorant people who desired **charitra-dharmacharan** (righteous conduct). The main purpose of using **Ardha Magadhi** in religious teachings was so that the listeners could easily understand the teachings without any hindrance or need for an intermediary interpreter. The **Aavashyak Niyukti** mentions that **Arhat-Tirthankaras** explain the meaning, **Ganadharas** compile it skillfully in the form of **Sutras** for the welfare of the **Dharma Sangha** (religious community), thus establishing the **Sutras**.

The teachings delivered by **Lord Mahavira** and compiled by his chief disciples, **Ganadharas**, are divided into the following **twelve Angas**:

1. **Achar**
2. **Sutra Krit**
3. **Sthan**
4. **Samavay**
5. **Vyakhya Prajnapti**
6. **Jnata Dharma Katha**
7. **Upasaka Dasha**
8. **Antakrid Dasha**
9. **Anuttaraupapatik Dasha**
10. **Prashna Vyakaran**
11. **Vipak**
12. **Drishtivad**

**2.**

**Lord Mahavira** taught in the **Ardha Magadhi** language. This **Ardha Magadhi** language, spoken by **Tirthankaras**, became the language of all **Aryan** beings, including **humans, animals, birds, and reptiles**, for their own comfort and happiness. - **Samavayanga Sutra-34.22.23**

For the benefit of children, women, elders, and ignorant people who desire righteous conduct, philosophers presented the principles in Prakrit. - **Dasha Vaikalik Vritti, page 223**

**Arhats** explain the meaning, **Ganadharas** skillfully compile it into a **Sutra** for the welfare of the **Dharma Sangha**. - **Aavashyak Niyukti 92**

The Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra: In ancient times, the scriptures of all religions were memorized by disciples from their gurus. This tradition continued, and this is likely the reason why the Vedas, which are called Shruti, were memorized by disciples from their teachers. The same reason seems to be behind the Jain scriptures being called Shruti. The Buddhists also memorized their scriptures through the Shravana tradition. This may also be because the renunciates, ascetics, Nirgranthas, and monks of all these traditions did not like to keep possessions, and a collection of scriptures is also a form of possession. If the scriptures are memorized, there is no need to keep books. This was possible because people then had excellent physical strength and memory.

After the Nirvana of Lord Mahavira, for about 560 years, the scriptures were preserved through the Shravana tradition of memorization. However, as time passed, people's physical strength and memory gradually declined. Another obstacle arose - a severe famine lasting 12 years occurred in Magadha, which was the main area of the Jains. This was during the reign of Emperor Chandragupta Maurya in all of North India. The conditions for obtaining proper, forbidden alms were not there, and the Jain monks scattered. Many died due to lack of food and water, and a concern arose in the Jain community that most of the scholars had perished. There was a fear that this rare Shruti treasure of our religion might be lost. A meeting was organized of the remaining monks who remembered the scriptures. Accordingly, under the leadership of Acharya Sthulabhadra, a meeting of Jain monks was held in Pataliputra to organize the Agamas. The Agamas were recited and preserved in memory.

Eleven Angas were compiled and organized at this meeting. The twelfth Anga, Drishtivad, was not remembered by any of the monks present at the meeting. According to history, only Acharya Bhadrabahu knew Drishtivad-Chaturdasha Purvas at that time. He was called Shruta Kevali. He was highly inclined towards sadhana, and therefore he was engaged in Mahapran meditation in a secluded place in Nepal. There is no discussion anywhere about what Mahapran meditation was. Meditation has certainly been of great importance in the Jain sadhana tradition. The ninth study of the first Shruti Skandha of the Acharang Sutra describes the charia of Lord Mahavira, where it is described that he meditated in many ways. The descriptions of Egg Poggal Nividdittthi - meditating by focusing one's vision on a single particle - indicate this. It seems that these various meditation techniques have not been preserved today. This Mahapran meditation was probably a specific practice of meditation based on the breathing process. Thus, the Jain community decided to send suitable, intelligent, and hardworking monks to him for study so that they could learn Drishtivad from him. It is said that 1500 monks were sent for this purpose, 500 of them were students and 1000 were their servants. They requested Acharya Bhadrabahu to impart knowledge with great humility and persuasion. The Acharya graciously agreed and began to teach them.

The study was so complex that the student monks could not stay there and gradually began to leave. In the end, only Sthulabhadra remained, who diligently continued his studies. He had thoroughly mastered the text and meaning of the first ten Purvas. The study of the eleventh Purva was about to begin when an unexpected event occurred. Sthulabhadra's sisters, who were nuns, arrived there to see their brother, the monk. Sthulabhadra...

---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states that due to curiosity and a display of knowledge, a monk transformed into a lion. The nuns were terrified. When the monk returned to his human form, they were reassured.

...

When Acharya Bhadrabahu learned of this incident, he was very angry with Sthulabhadra. He told him, "Knowledge is not for display. The life goal of a Jain monk is spirituality and peace. You have not done well. Your studies will cease now." Sthulabhadra accepted his mistake, repented deeply, and pleaded to be taught the remaining knowledge of the **fourteen Purvas**. With great humility, devotion, and respect, he repeatedly requested this. Acharya Bhadrabahu agreed to teach him the remaining **fourteen Purvas** but only the text, not the meaning. Accordingly, he taught Sthulabhadra only the text of the **four Purvas** and sent him back.

Thus, after Bhadrabahu, the complete knowledge of the **fourteen Purvas** was lost. Ten **Purvas** remained with both text and meaning, while the remaining four **Purvas** only had the text.

The first attempt to compile the **Agamas** in Pataliputra under the leadership of Acharya Sthulabhadra is called the first reading of the **Agamas**. It is also called the Pataliputra reading because it was performed in Pataliputra. The compilation or reading of the **Agamas** meant that the **Agamas** that were memorized were to be collected, corrected, and organized. This was done, but the **Agamas** were kept in their memorized form. As mentioned earlier, like the Jain **Agamas**, the Vedas were also kept in the **Shruti** tradition or memorized. There was no attempt to compile them again, nor was it considered necessary. There is a difference: the Vedas are written in Sanskrit, which is a grammatical language. The structure of a language governed by grammar does not allow for much change. Also, there has been a special effort to keep the word structure of the Vedas unchanged and stable. There have been five stages of recitation of the same mantra: **Sangeeta Path**, **Pad Path**, **Kram Path**, **Jata Path**, and **Ghan Path**. These stages use different forms of recitation of the mantra with a highly scientific method, which prevents any change in the words. To keep the recitation order uninterrupted, there are rules for **Udatta**, **Anudatta**, and **Sanswarita**, which have resulted in the Vedas being recited today in the same way they were recited hundreds of years ago.

The Jain **Agamas** are in a different situation. They are in **Ardha Magadhi Prakrit**, which was a vernacular language. Unlike Sanskrit, it was not bound by the complex rules of grammar. Vernacular languages are not bound by strict grammatical rules and flow with the common language. Texts written in such languages are prone to change. This is why, about 270-289 years after the Pataliputra reading, around 827-840 years after the Nirvana of Lord Mahavira, another attempt was made to organize the **Agamas**. Coincidentally, there was a terrible famine at that time, which made it difficult for the monks to get alms. As a result, many Jain monks died, and the proper order of study of the **Agamas** was disrupted. This led to the Jain community considering holding a gathering of monks to preserve the **Agamas** in their pure form. Accordingly, under the leadership of Arya Skandil, who was the leading Jain Acharya at that time, a gathering of monks was organized in Mathura, which was once a major center of Jainism. Monks from different places who had the **Agamas** present came to the gathering. The **Agamas** were read and compiled, and the **Agamas** were organized accordingly.

Page #19:
---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** was the second attempt at compiling the Agamas, hence it is called the **Dvitiya Vachana**. It is also known as **Mathuri Vachana** because it was held in Mathura.

Around the time of the Mathuri Vachana, a conference was held in Vallabhi, a city in the Saurashtra region, under the leadership of Acharya Nagarjuna Suri. The purpose of this conference was to compile and organize the Agamas. The Agam-knowing monks recited, discussed, and harmonized the Agamas. The Agamas were organized systematically.

One reason for having two Vachanas at the same time could be that it was not considered possible for all monks, both near and far, to reach one location. Jain monks are traditionally **padavihari**, meaning they do not use vehicles, and travel on foot, no matter the distance. It is possible that monks from North India, West India, and East India reached Mathura. Mathura may have been too far for monks from Central India and South India. Vallabhi, which was once a renowned center of Jainism in India, may have been closer to the monks of Central and South India, making it a suitable location for a second conference. This seems practical and useful. This is also referred to as the second Vachana. It is called **Vallabhi Vachana** because it was held in Vallabhi.

In this Vachana, the Agamas were also kept in the memorized order. However, as time passed, people's memory became weaker. They also lacked the same physical strength. Therefore, it became difficult to keep the vast knowledge of the Agamas intact in memory. It began to be forgotten. It then seemed necessary to recite the Agamas again. Accordingly, a conference of monks was held in Vallabhi 980-993 years after the Nirvana of Bhagwan Mahavira. The renowned Agam-knowing Acharya Shri Devarddhiganikshama Shraman led the conference. The monks present at the conference were aware of the previous two Vachanas. They recited, discussed, and compiled the Agamas according to their memory. They primarily considered the Mathuri Vachana as their reference and worked based on it.

Some variations in the text had developed among different Shraman groups. There were also differences in the Vachanas in some places. All of these were harmonized, and the text of the Agamas was organized. While attempting to harmonize, any text that could not be harmonized was marked with a note indicating the difference in the Vachana, i.e., "according to such and such Vachana, these are the texts." The twelfth Anga, **Dristivad**, was not present in the memory of any Shraman, so it could not be compiled and was declared lost.

One special feature of this Vachana was that while the Agamas were not written down in the previous two Vachanas, they were only kept in memory. Here, considering that memory would no longer be sufficient, the Agamas were written down. The Agamas available to us today are in the form of the Agamas compiled in this third Vachana.

It is important to note that the available Agamas are accepted by the **Shwetamber** tradition of Jainism. They are not considered authentic by the **Digamber** tradition. They believe that the **Dwadashanga** was lost 683 years after the Nirvana of Bhagwan Mahavira. Therefore, they do not accept any text as authentic in the form of the words spoken by Bhagwan Mahavira. In the middle of the first and second centuries AD, there was a prominent Acharya named **Dharasen** in the Digamber tradition. It is said that he had some knowledge of **Dristivad** in his memory.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

It is said that the authors of this text resided in the Chandragufa cave on Mount Girnar in Saurashtra for the purpose of their spiritual practice. The Digambara Jain community decided to acquire knowledge from them to prevent the loss of their tradition. Therefore, the community sent two highly revered monks, Pushpadanta and Bhootbali, to learn from them. Both monks diligently acquired knowledge from them and returned after gaining it.

Later, these same monks, Pushpadanta and Bhootbali, composed a scripture in six parts, known as the Shatkhandagama. Acharya Pushpadanta composed the Satpraroopan in one hundred and seventy-seven (177) sutras, and Acharya Bhootbali composed the remaining text in six thousand (6000) sutras. This was primarily based on the fourth Prabhrit Adhikar, named Maha Karma Prakriti, of the second Agraahmani Purva, within the Chaturdasha Purva. This Agama is considered equivalent to the scriptures in the Digambara tradition.

Many Acharyas have written commentaries on the Shatkhandagama over time. In the eighth century, a great scholar named Acharya Vira Sena wrote a very important commentary on the Shatkhandagama, known as the Dhavala. It is written in a mixture of Sanskrit and Prakrit and contains seventy-two thousand (72,000) verses. Around the time of Acharya Dharasen, there was a very accomplished Acharya named Gunadhar in the Digambara tradition. It is believed that he also had partial knowledge of the Dvadasanga Sutra. He composed the Siddhanta text called Kashaya Prabhrit. Acharya Vira Sena also wanted to write a commentary on Kashaya Prabhrit and began writing, but he could only complete a portion containing two thousand verses before his passing. His learned disciple, Acharya Jinsen, completed the remaining work. This commentary is known as Jay Dhavala and contains a total of sixty thousand verses. The Shatkhandagama is a very important work on Jain Karmavada.

Thus, the Jain Agamas discussed above are accepted by the Svetambara tradition. However, there is no consensus among all Svetambara sects regarding their number. The Svetambara Mandir Margi sect considers 84 or 45 Agamas, while the Svetambara Sthanakvasi and Terapanthi sects, who do not believe in idol worship, accept 32 Agamas: Achar, Sutra Krit, Sthan, Samavay, Vyakhya Prajnapti, Jnatadharmakatha, Upasak Dasha, Antakridasha, Anuttaroupapathik Dasha, Prashna Vyakaran, Vipak.

**11 Angas**

**12 Upangas** - Aupapathik, Raj Prasniya, Jivaabhigam, Prajnapana, Surya Prajnapti, Jambudvipa Prajnapti, Chandra Prajnapti, Nirayavaliya, Kalpavatanshika, Pushpika, Pushpachoolika, Vrishni Dasha.

Vyavahar, Vrihatkalpa, Nishita, Dasha Shruta Skandha.

Dasha Vaikalik, Uttaradhyayana, Nandi, Anuyogadwar.

**4 Cheda**

**4 Mool**

**1 Aavashyak**

Of these, 11 Angas and 21 Upangas are external, connected to the Angas in terms of subject matter and other aspects. Acharya Ary Rakshit Suri, considering the differences in subject matter, explanation, and analysis, divided the Agamas into four categories, known as Anuyogas. The Agamas that primarily discuss the tradition of conduct, analysis of vows, right knowledge, and right faith, along with restraint, penance, control of passions, and avoidance of negative tendencies, are accepted in the Charan Karan Anuyog category. They also describe the virtues of community, contemplation, images, purification of offerings, copying, secrecy, and acceptance.

Page #21:
---------------------------
The **Śrī Sūtrakr̥tāṅga Sūtra**, under the **Caraṇakaraṇānuyoga**, includes the **Ācārāṅga**, **Praśnavyākaraṇa**, **Daśavaikālika**, **Niśītha**, **Vyavahāra**, **Vṛhatkalpa**, and **Daśāśruta-skandha**.

The **Dharma Kathānuyoga** category includes Āgamas that primarily discuss the limbs of Dharma, such as **dāna**, **śīla**, **kṣamā**, **ārjava**, **mārda**, **dayā**, etc., through narratives and stories. This category includes **Jñātādharmkathā**, **Upāsakadāśā**, **Antakṛtadāśā**, **Anuttaroppapātidāśā**, **Aupapātika**, **Rājapraśnīya**, **Niryāvalī**, **Kalpāvatansīkā**, **Puṣpikā**, **Puṣpa-cūlikā**, **Vṛṣṇidāśā**, **Vipāka**, and **Uttarādhyayana**.

The **Gaṇitanuyoga** category includes Āgamas that discuss mathematical topics or topics based on mathematics. This category includes **Jambūdvīpa Prajñapti** and **Sūryacandra Prajñapti**.

The **Dravyānuyoga** category includes Āgamas that provide detailed and subtle discussions of the 66 substances (**dravya**), including **jīva**, **ajīva**, and their related narratives. This category primarily includes **Sūtrakr̥tāṅga**, **Sthānāṅga**, **Samavāyāṅga**, and **Vyākhyā Prajñāti** (**Bhagavatī**).

Jain Āgamas provide detailed discussions of Jain philosophy, ethical guidelines, analysis of principles, detailed explanations of vows, practices of austerity, spiritual practices, and topics related to the self-respect of every individual. This is their inherent importance. However, they also provide valuable evidence of ancient Indian society, laws, regulations, customs, traditions, social life, agriculture, commerce, governance, and other social topics. This evidence is crucial for understanding the long history of human development.

Among Indian literature, the **Ardha-māgadhī Āgamas** and the **Pāli Tripitaka** are the only texts that do not solely focus on the grandeur of the state and the power of rulers. Instead, they also include events related to the lives of ordinary people. Among these, the Jain Āgamas hold exceptional significance. They provide detailed descriptions of farmers, laborers, merchants, administrators, security forces, soldiers, culinary arts, clothing, utensils, art, writing, scripts, paintings, music, and other fine arts. This evidence provides a glimpse into human culture and history. Therefore, the study of Jain Āgamas is not only beneficial for those who believe in Jainism but also for those who study culture, religion, history, philosophy, sociology, linguistics, and other subjects.

Until now, scholars and learned individuals have not paid much attention to this subject. However, there has been a growing interest in studying these texts from a broader perspective. Indians, in particular, became interested in this subject when renowned German scholar Dr. Hermann Jacobi and others engaged in deep and meticulous studies of Jain Āgamas and Ardha-māgadhī. They made scholars aware of the vast usefulness of these texts.

I was fortunate to have dedicated a significant part of my life to studying Prakrit, Jain philosophy, and Jain Āgamas. I had the opportunity to study, research, and teach at the Vaiśālī Research Institute, a prominent center for research on Prakrit, Jain philosophy, and non-violence in India. Subsequently, the young Ācārya, **Śrī Vardhamāna Sthā. Jain Śramaṇa Saṅgha**, **Saumya-cetā**, **Vidvan-mūrdhanya**, **Prabuddha Āgama-jña**, **Svāmi Śrī Miśrīmal Jī 'Madhukara'**, planned to translate and annotate the 32 Āgamas into Hindi and publish them. I continuously contributed to the implementation of this plan. I translated, analyzed, and annotated the **Upāsakadāśāṅga Sūtra** and three other Āgamas, including **Jambūdvīpa**. Most of the Āgamas were published during the lifetime of the young Ācārya. The remaining Āgamas were published soon after his passing. This collection of 32 Āgamas, including Hindi translations, became a beautiful edition that scholars have deemed very useful and beneficial to the world.

Page #22:
---------------------------
The **Śrī Sūtrakr̥tāṅga Sūtra** is an important text in the context of the Jain tradition. I had the opportunity to study under the guidance of **Śrī Nānak Āmnāya**, the head of the **Staṇakavāsī Jain tradition**, **Sv. Ācārya Śrī Sohनलाल Jī M. Sā.**, who was a scholar of the **Āgamas**, a poet, and a close friend of mine during the last four years of his life. I also had the opportunity to teach **Muni Śrī Sadarśanalāl Jī** (now **Ācārya Śrī Sadarśan Manijī**) and **Priyadarśan Jī**, who were young monks at the time, under his tutelage. I taught them various subjects, including Sanskrit, Prakrit, grammar, literature, philosophy, poetry, ethics, and yoga, as well as the **Āgamas**.

Following the wishes of **Sv. Ācārya Śrī Sohनलाल Jī**, we began studying the commentary on the **Sūtrakr̥tāṅga** by **Śīlāṅkācārya** in **Gulābpura** in **Vikram Samvat 2052**. **Ācārya Pravara** was very happy about this, especially during his stay in **Rātakot**.

Many scholars from India and abroad have considered the **Sūtrakr̥tāṅga** to be a very important text within the **Dvādaśāṅga**. Scholars like **Dr. Harman** and **Dr. Pishel** have identified the language of the **Ācārāṅga** and **Sūtrakr̥tāṅga** as the oldest form of **Ardha-Māgadhī Prakrit**.

The discussions of non-Jain philosophical views in the **Sūtrakr̥tāṅga** are very useful for comparative philosophical studies. This is the only **Āgama** that presents the theories of different philosophers on topics like the soul, the world, and karma.

The **Sūtrakr̥tāṅga** discusses **Kriyāvāda**, **Akriyāvāda**, **Ajñānavāda**, **Kṣaṇikavāda**, **Pañcabhūtavāda**, and **Ātmaṣaṣṭhavāda**, but it does not provide a detailed explanation of any single philosophy. However, there are some hints that allow us to identify these theories with different philosophical schools. The discussions of various philosophical topics in the **Sūtrakr̥tāṅga** suggest that the philosophies that are available to us today had not yet reached their refined and established forms. This was probably the early stage of the development of philosophies. Different thinkers emphasized different theories to establish their own views. The descriptions in the **Sūtrakr̥tāṅga** inspire researchers to conduct further in-depth study and research on these topics. Researchers should pay special attention to this aspect. Studying these topics can help solve many mysteries in the field of philosophy.

The **Āgama** literature has always been considered important and useful in the Jain world. This is why a vast amount of explanatory literature has been written on them in the form of **niyuktis**, **bhāṣyas**, **cūrṇis**, and **ṭīkās**. The **niyuktis** are written in **Ārya-gāthā** meter in Prakrit. They explain the meaning or implication of the **sūtras** in a definitive way. To make the explanations understandable, many stories and examples are used, but only their mention is found in the **niyuktis**. These explanations are very symbolic and concise, and it is difficult to understand them without the help of **bhāṣyas** and **ṭīkās**. Therefore, the commentators of the **Āgamas** have written commentaries on the **niyuktis** along with the **Āgamas**. One special feature of the **niyuktis** is that they are short and written in verse, making them easy to memorize. Therefore, they could be quoted in religious sermons. Tradition holds that **Ācārya Dvitīya Bhadravāhu**, who was an expert in **Aṣṭāṅga Nimitta** and **Mantra Vidya**, was the author of the **niyuktis**.

Just as there were compositions in Prakrit **gāthās** for the **niyuktis**, there were also compositions for the **bhāṣyas**. The language of the **niyuktis** and **bhāṣyas** is ancient **Ardha-Māgadhī**. The main **bhāṣyas** are the **Niśītha Bhāṣya**, **Vyavahāra Bhāṣya**, and

Page #23:
---------------------------
The **Sri Sutra Kritanga Sutra**, **Brihatkalpa Bhashya** are considered to be of great importance. They contain numerous worldly stories, ancient traditions of ascetics, and their thoughts. 

These three commentaries are essential for understanding the ancient philosophy, conduct, and rituals of the Jain ascetic community. After the **niyuktis** and **bhashyas**, **churnis** come into play. These were written in prose. The reason for this was that it was relatively difficult to elaborate on the principles of Jain philosophy and religion in the **niyuktis** and **bhashyas**, which were written in Prakrit verses. **Churnis**, being written in prose, provided a better platform for this. Additionally, **churnis** introduced a novel linguistic experiment. They were written in a mixture of Sanskrit and Prakrit, a style known as **Mani Praval Naya** in literature. Just as beads and corals, when combined, remain distinct, so too do Sanskrit and Prakrit, even when blended, retain their individual identities. Prakrit predominates in **churnis**. The narrative portion of **churnis** is written entirely in Prakrit, presenting topics like religious stories, moral tales, and folk tales in a style accessible to the common people. Wherever necessary, the etymologies of words are also provided in Prakrit. As the context demands, numerous verses in Sanskrit and Prakrit are also quoted. 

The **Churnis** on **Nishith Sutra** and **Aavashyak Sutra** hold immense significance. They provide a wealth of archaeological and historical material. They shed light on the diverse social customs and traditions prevalent in different countries in ancient times, including festivals, celebrations, periods of abundance and scarcity, trade, commerce, trade routes, maritime trade, merchant caravans, carriers, bandits, thieves, guards, food items, clothing, ornaments, art, and skills. This analysis in **churnis** is invaluable for students of Indian knowledge. **Churni** literature is also highly significant from the perspectives of folklore and linguistics. 

**Jinadas Ganimahattar** is widely recognized as the author of most **churnis**. He is said to have belonged to the **Vaanijya Kula**, **Kautika Gan**, and **Braj Shakha**. While definitive evidence regarding his time is unavailable, scholars speculate that he lived around the 6th century CE. 

**Churnis** are available on **Aachaarang**, **Sutra Kritanga**, **Bhagavati**, **Kalpa**, **Vyavahar**, **Nishith**, **Panchakalapa Dasha Shruta Skandha**, **Jeet Kalpa**, **Jeevaabhigam**, **Prajnaapana**, **Sharira Pad**, **Jambudeep Prajna**, **Uttaraadhyaayan**, **Aavashyak Sutra**, **Dasha Vaikalik**, **Nandi**, and **Anuyogadvaar Sutra**.

To provide a detailed analysis of the principles and ideas presented in the **Agamas**, a vast body of literature in the form of commentaries was created in Sanskrit. Sanskrit holds exceptional importance from a linguistic perspective. It possesses the unique ability to convey a maximum meaning with a minimum of words. The clarity and suitability that Sanskrit offers for explaining subjects like knowledge are unmatched by any other language. Jain scholars were not dogmatic; they were always pragmatic. They never shied away from accepting anything that proved useful or beneficial. Although the core literature of the Jain tradition is in Prakrit, when it came to presenting analytical perspectives, Jain thinkers embraced Sanskrit with great enthusiasm. The **Mani Praval Naya** mentioned in the context of **churnis**, which combines Sanskrit and Prakrit, points to this very approach.

Another point worth considering is that Sanskrit holds significance even from the perspective of being suitable for learned audiences. **Aachaarya Siddharsi**, the author of **Upamiti Bhav Prapancha Katha**, explains why he chose to write his work in Sanskrit instead of Prakrit. He writes that through Sanskrit, the ideas presented in his work...

The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** will reach the scholars, they will take it for contemplation, if even one scholar understands the truth, it is far more valuable than thousands of ordinary people understanding it. Because through it, that message will reach millions, the commentators must have had such a tendency in their minds. Many Acharyas have written commentaries on many Agamas, which are useful from their own perspective.
Acharya Sheelank has commentaries on **Acharang** and **Sutra Kritanga**, as mentioned above. Acharya Sheelank has discussed the principles, doctrines, and thought streams that have come in the Agamas with great scholarship, his language is mature, his style of description is serious, and there is a confluence of logic. The symbolic descriptions that have come in the Agamas have become very clear and detailed due to the commentary.
During the time of study and teaching of the commentary, a thought arose that it would be good if it were published in the simple form of the national language Hindi, in a modern style. The scholar Acharya Shri Sudarshanlal Ji M. Sa. and Munishri Priyadarshan Ji M. Sa. further emphasized that this would be of special benefit to the inquisitive, the seekers, and the students studying Prakrit and Jainology in various universities, as **Sutra Kritanga** is accepted as a textbook in Prakrit and Jainology in many universities.
Discussions were also held with the officials and workers of the **Shri Sthanakwasi Jain Swadhyayi Sangh**, everyone found this idea to be worthy. On Akshaya Tritiya, Vikram Samvat 2055, a grand celebration of the year-long fast was organized in the presence of the venerable Acharya Pravar Shri Sudarshanlal Ji M. Sa., the young sage, at the **Shriman Bhim Singh Ji Sancheti's Mill Super Synthetics Ltd.** At that time, all the sadhus and sadhvis of the Nanak Amnaya were present. A seminar was organized in the presence of the venerable Acharya, in which I also had the opportunity to be present. In the seminar, the thought arose that in the memory of the revered Gurudev Acharya Pravar Late Shri Sohनलाल Ji M. Sa., the Swadhyayi Sangh should take up some literary work that would benefit the entire Jain world and the field of Jain studies for all time.
After contemplation and deliberation, it was concluded that the commentaries written by Acharya Sheelank on these two Angas, **Acharang** and **Sutra Kritanga**, and the commentaries written by Acharya Abhaydevsuri on the remaining nine Angas, should be published in Hindi translation in the memory of the revered Gurudev Acharya Shri Sohनलाल Ji M. Sa. There has been very little effort to translate the commentaries into Hindi. The translation of the commentary of Sheelankacharya on **Sutra Kritanga** was done by Pandit Ambikadatt Ji Ojha under the guidance of Shrimad Javahiracharya, which was published a long time ago and is now unavailable. In this long period, the national language Hindi has undergone multifaceted development in terms of style, presentability, etc. Therefore, its translation in a modern style will be useful for the people at present, keeping this in mind, it was decided to publish the Hindi translation of the commentaries of eleven Angas.
In this regard, correspondence was done with eminent Jain Acharyas, learned multi-learned Munis, and distinguished scholars of Prakrit, Jain Agamas, and philosophy in the country. Everyone considered this work necessary and worthy and expressed their willingness to cooperate.
In this context, the thought arose here that we should start this work with the translation of the Sanskrit commentary of Sheelankacharya on **Sutra Kritanga**. Accordingly, the main editor of this work, the young sage, _xx_

---------------------------
- The valuable assistance of Acharya Shri Sudarsanlalji M. Sa. in the form of editing and guidance for the Shri Sutrakrutanga Sutra was continuously received.
I took up this work with Muni Shri Priyadarshanji, with the resolve to complete it within this Chaturmas period. Our combined work continued almost all three times, morning, noon, and afternoon, and we are pleased to say that this work was completed well before the end of the Chaturmas period.
Keeping the sentiments of the original commentator intact, we have humbly attempted to present this translation in modern, simple Hindi. The order of the sentence structure is such that even if only the translation is read without the original, there is no hindrance in the sentiments. For those who read with the original, this "translation will be useful because the words of the commentary are often presented in their original form, explaining their meaning. To facilitate understanding of different sentiments in detail, an attempt has also been made to give the same passage in different paragraphs. An attempt has been made to express the difficult and most complex sentiments in the simplest words. Hopefully, this translation will prove useful for those who are curious about the Agamas, and for students, researchers, and scholars of Prakrit and Jain scriptures in various universities and institutions, they will study it with interest.
It is to be noted here that the commentator has written some proposals from his side at the beginning of each study, it was not considered necessary to take it in order from the point of view of the original verses of the Agamas, because it is the commentator's own thoughts, so that the study does not become burdensome for the students, it remains simple and easy, from this point of view, their translation has not been given.
Shri Amolchandji Hingad and Shri Mahendra Singhji Khabia, the devout followers, have taken great pains in preparing the press version of the original, verses, shadow, Sanskrit commentary and Hindi translation of the commentary. They are worthy of praise for the heartfelt cooperation they have given in this Shrutopasana original work.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra
**Heartfelt Expression**

To the revered Shri Priyadarshan Muni Ji M. Sa.

It is our good fortune that the words of Bhagwan Mahavira are still preserved in the form of eleven Angas. This is the speech that resonates with the eternal voice of self-awakening, well-being, and prosperity for all. This is the literature that proved to be extremely beneficial for humanity in the past. Even today, people can find the right path to happiness and peace by following the principles laid out in it. Today, when the highest human qualities like religion, spirituality, ethics, morality, honesty, authenticity, and compassion are fading away, there is a dire need to spread the principles of non-violence, truth, purity, and non-possession as laid out in the Agamas. Truth is never old, it is timeless, and its utility is also timeless. This Agama is such a nectar-like literature that has the extraordinary ability to guide everyone on the path of upliftment forever.

During my studies, I had the opportunity to listen to the Agama principles from the mouth of my unforgettable, most revered Gurudev, the late Acharya Pravar Shri Sohनलाल Ji M. Sa., which not only strengthened my spiritual curiosity but also provided me with solutions. As a result of the immense grace, efforts, and feelings of the same revered Gurudev Shri, I and the current Sanghanayak Acharya Pravar Shri Sudarshanlal Ji M. Sa. got the opportunity to study from Dr. Chaganlal Ji Shastri, a renowned scholar of India, a master of Sanskrit, Prakrit, Pali, and other oriental and Indian languages. Along with literature, grammar, and other subjects, I specifically studied the Sanskrit commentary on Sutra Kritanga by Sheelangaacharya under him. This commentary is indeed very important from the point of view of revealing the secrets of the scriptures, deep understanding of the principles, and analysis of the discussion. While reading it, our thirst for knowledge and curiosity got even more strength, and we got the inspiration to immerse ourselves in the further study of the Agamas.

The beautiful outcome of this was that the Jain Swadhyayi Sangh, under the auspices of the Shwe. Sta., planned to publish Hindi translations of the Sanskrit commentaries written on the eleven Angas. This will enable the Hindi world to benefit from the deep study and contemplation of the commentators on the subject of Agamas.

1

Under the same plan, the work of translating the commentary on Sutra Kritanga was started. The special inspiration of the most revered Acharya Pravar Shri Sudarshanlal Ji M. Sa. and the learned Dr. Shastri Ji was that I should also be involved in this translation work. Accordingly, I, along with Dr. Shastri Ji, started this translation work.

---------------------------
I have been involved in the translation of the **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra**. Working with a highly learned scholar has been a great learning experience. I have gained many new insights in terms of language style, presentation, etc., by being involved in the translation. This has also inspired me to humbly attempt to translate commentaries on some other **Agamas**. I believe this will provide me with a wonderful opportunity to refine my knowledge, contemplate, reflect, and practice, which is a blessing for a virtuous life. What greater benefit can a **nirgrantha muni** have than to dedicate his life to the eternal worship of **Shruta** and **Charitra**?

As Dr. Shastriji has stated in the preface, it is hoped that readers, students, and scholars will benefit from studying this translation along with the original text.

While translating the commentary on the **Agama**, utmost care has been taken to ensure that the sentiments of the **Agama** and the commentator are preserved. However, if any shortcomings remain due to my limited knowledge, I humbly request the readers to inform me of them with the witness of the infinite **Siddhas** so that corrections can be made.

## The Authority of Self-Time Statement
**Sri Sutra Kritanga Sutra - First Study with Accurate Translation - The Authority of Self-Time Statement - First Uddesaka**

**Bujjhijjatti tiuttījjā, bandhanaṃ parijāṇiā. Kimāha bandhanaṃ vīro, kim vā jāṇaṃ tiuttī? ||1||**

**Chāyā**
-
**Budhyetītrod bandhanaṃ parijñāya.
Kimāha bandhanaṃ vīraḥ kim vā jānaṃ stroṭayati ||1||**

**Translation:** A human being should strive to attain knowledge, to know the truth. They should also understand what bondage is. What is the nature of bondage as explained by Lord Mahavira? How can one understand and break the bondage of karma?

**Commentary:** This sutra is found in the Sutra Kritanga and other texts. It has a connection with the Acharanga. As stated in the Acharanga, "A being is of six types, based on their physical form. Their killing leads to the bondage of karma," and so on. All this is worth knowing. Alternatively, some schools of thought believe that liberation is attained through knowledge alone, while others believe it is attained through action alone. However, Jainism believes that liberation is attained through both, conduct and action. This verse highlights this point. Even there, action performed with knowledge is particularly fruitful. Therefore, the word "Bujjhijjā" - "Budhyet" signifies knowledge. The word "Tiuttī" - "Stroṭayet" refers to action. The meaning is that a person should attain knowledge, understand reality. What should they understand? Keeping this question in mind, it is said that they should understand bondage. The regions of a being where they are interconnected, the karma particles...

Page #30:
---------------------------
The Sutra of the Sri Sutra Kritanga. When things become attached to each other, they become intertwined, they merge into each other, this is called bondage. There are eight types of karma, such as Jnanavaraniya. Or, it should be known that the causes of these are Mithyatva, Aviriti, etc., or Parigraha, Himsa, etc. Just by attaining Kevala Jnana, the desired or desired purpose is not achieved, therefore, it shows the direction of action. Knowing the bondage, one should break the bondage by specific actions in accordance with restrained conduct, one should separate the soul from the group of bound karma, Samavaya karma. When this was said, Jambuswami and other disciples, with a special curiosity about the nature of bondage, etc., asked - What did Tirthankara Mahavira call bondage, or what does a man know to break bondage, or by what does bondage break - this is the meaning of this verse.
**Verse 2**
**Chittamantamachittam va, parigriha kisamavi.**
**Annam va anujanaai, evam dukkha na mucchai.**
**Translation:**
A person who is Chittavant - conscious - accepts bipeds, quadrupeds, etc., or Achittavant - unconscious - accepts gold, silver, etc., valuable things, or even very ordinary things like straw, grass, and pus, as Parigraha, keeps them, and allows others to do the same - to accept them as Parigraha, does not become free from suffering, does not get rid of it.
**Commentary:**
To explain the nature of the question of bondage, it is said - Here, bondage is referred to as karma-related or karma-induced, there, the cause is not shown without the cause of the birth of the cause, so the cause is shown. There, too, all beginnings are mostly karma-based, arising from the attachment to the self, so Parigraha is shown first. Chitta is the use, knowledge, that which has it is Chittavant - bipeds, quadrupeds, etc., other than that is Achittavant - gold, silver, etc., accepting both of these as Parigraha, even accepting the small, even straw, dust, etc., is the meaning. Or, if it is the act of taking, the act of taking, the result of the movement of the living being with the understanding of Parigraha, then, in this way, by accepting Parigraha for oneself, by accepting others, or by allowing others, one suffers from suffering - eight types of karma, their fruits, or the form of Asatodaya, etc., therefore, one does not get rid of it. Parigraha itself is the root of all evil in reality. And so it is said:
"As long as there is the fever of ego, the fire of pride,
It is the mouth of death, there is no peace, no upliftment.
Those who desire fame and happiness, by these means,
They are rejected by others, somehow, from somewhere."
And so, "Hatred is the abode of attachment, the decay of patience,
The opposite of patience is the rule,
The dwelling place of disturbance, the friend of pride,
The enemy of meditation is difficult.
The origin of suffering, the death of happiness, the abode of sin is oneself,
Even for the wise, Parigraha is like a snare, for suffering and destruction."
And so, in the case of Parigraha, there is anxiety and sorrow when it is not obtained, and when it is obtained, there is protection, enjoyment, and dissatisfaction, so in the presence of Parigraha, one does not get rid of the bondage of suffering.
**Commentary:**
While explaining the nature of the question related to bondage, it is said -

## Self-Time Statement of Authority

Here, karma or the causes of karma are called bondage. Without a cause or reason, the effect of the cause does not arise - it does not come into existence, therefore, here we first explain the bondage of the Agamas. All actions beginning with violence are the material cause of karma. These actions are mainly born from the feeling of "I" and "mine", from the grasping intellect. Therefore, in the beginning, only the grasping is shown.

Anything that has the activity of mind, knowledge, or consciousness is called "chittavan". Two-legged, four-legged creatures are included in this. Besides them, gold, silver, etc., which are devoid of mind or consciousness, are called "achitta". This is of two types. To take and keep both these types of grasping, even if it is something as insignificant as grass and dust, comes under keeping grasping. Another explanation of grasping is to be attracted to an object, to be driven towards it by the grasping intellect - this is also included in grasping. The person who himself keeps grasping, makes others do the same, and approves of those who keep grasping, does not become free from the eight types of karma and their painful fruits. To be attached to grasping, to remain bound by it, is truly meaningless.

It is said - "This is mine, this is me", this ego-based burning fever, as long as it remains in a person, then the face of Yama, the god of death, is his only refuge - until death, he remains trapped in it. He does not attain peace. Those who have a thirst for fame and pleasure - a strong desire, which ultimately bears only misfortune, acquire this grasping, which is harmful and painful, with great difficulty. And also,

This grasping is the dwelling place of hatred, the decay of patience, the enemy of forbearance, the friend of mental distraction, the abode of pride, the painful enemy of meditation, the cause of suffering, the destroyer of happiness, and the dwelling place of sin - it is filled with sin. Grasping, like the opposite of grasping, destroys the wise man, causing him pain.

The desire to obtain grasping that is not obtained remains, when it is obtained and goes away, then a longing arises in the mind. There is also pain in protecting the obtained grasping, the mind remains restless, even when it is continuously enjoyed, there is no satisfaction - man does not become free from it. Therefore, as long as grasping remains, there is no escape from the painful bondage.

**Verse:**

*Self-inflicts death upon oneself, or causes it to be inflicted by others.
He who approves of the killer, increases his own enmity towards those beings.*

**Translation:**

*A person who inflicts death upon himself or others, or approves of those who do so, increases his enmity towards those beings - his conduct towards them is like that of an enemy.*

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra
### Commentary

This commentary explains that a person attached to possessions inevitably engages in actions that lead to violence. The text states:

"If, in another way, the person bound by possessions is not satisfied, and desires more, and is driven by the desire to acquire more, and is the cause of trouble, then he himself destroys the life of a living being through his mind, speech, and body, or through his life force, strength, and body. The word 'tiwayae' is actually 'atiwayae', meaning to destroy life excessively."

The commentary further explains that a person attached to possessions not only harms others directly but also encourages others to do so. By engaging in violence, supporting violence, and encouraging violence, such a person creates a cycle of hatred that binds them to suffering for countless lifetimes. The commentary concludes by stating that other forms of harmful actions, such as lying, are also causes of bondage.

The text then quotes a verse:

"In a family where a person is born, or where they live, a child is born, and they faint in the presence of others."

This verse highlights the suffering that arises from attachment to possessions and the consequences of violence.

Page #33:
---------------------------
## Self-Time Statement of Authority

A person, due to the family he was born into or the people he lives with, if he develops attachment, he suffers, is destroyed, or is distressed. Such an ignorant man becomes unconscious, deluded, or attached to other things, worldly objects.

**Commentary:**

This verse further elaborates on the nature of bondage. It says, "In which" (meaning the family, nation, etc.) a person is born, or with whom he plays in the dust as a child, or with whom he lives as a friend, wife, etc., in those (mother, father, brother, sister, wife, etc.), he develops attachment, thinking "this is mine," and becomes attached to them. Due to this attachment, he suffers, is destroyed, or is distressed. This is because of the karma generated by attachment, which binds him to the cycle of birth and death, characterized by hell, animal life, human life, and heavenly life. Who is this person? He is a child, ignorant, lacking the ability to discern between right and wrong. This means that due to excessive attachment, he becomes unconscious, deluded, greedy, and attached to various things. First, he is attached to his parents, then to his wife, and then to his children, and so on.

**Verse 5:**

Wealth, siblings, and even life itself cannot protect anyone from suffering. Knowing the impermanence and brevity of life, a being should strive to break free from the bonds of karma.

**Commentary:**

This verse explains how to break free from bondage. It says, "Wealth, possessions, whether animate or inanimate, and siblings, brothers, sisters, etc., all this" (meaning wealth, etc.) cannot protect a being from the intense physical and mental suffering that he experiences in this world. Knowing this, and knowing that life is short, a being should renounce attachment to possessions, animate and inanimate, and to life itself. He should also renounce harming other beings, attachment to family, and other forms of bondage. By doing so, he will break free from the bonds of karma. Alternatively, it could mean that he breaks free from karma through action, through the practice of self-control and discipline.

Page #34:
---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Commentary:**  Previously, it was stated that a being who knows, breaks the bonds. Now, analyzing the same, it is said:

**Wealth** refers to material possessions, which are of two types: **Saccitta-Saprana** (possessing consciousness and life) and **Acitta-Aprana** (lacking consciousness and life).  Brothers, sisters, and possessions, wealth, etc., in the world, are unable to save a being from the intense, painful, physical and mental suffering they experience. Knowing this, and understanding that the life of beings is short, a being, through **Jnana-Parijna** (knowledge-based consciousness) and **Pratyakhyana-Parijna** (renunciation-based consciousness), renounces **Saccitta** and **Acitta** possessions, violence towards beings, attachment and delusion towards family members, etc., which are the locations or causes of **Karma-bandha**. By renouncing these, they break free from **Karma**, become separate, and are liberated. Here, the word "Tu" is used in the sense of certainty, meaning they **do** break free. This also implies that they are liberated from the bonds of **Karma** through actions aligned with **Samyama-palana** (self-control).

**Verse 6:**

**Text:**

**Shadow:**
एतान् ग्रंथान् व्युत्क्रम्य एके श्रमण ब्राह्मणाः । अजानन्तो व्युत्सिताः सक्ताः कामेषु मानवाः ॥६॥

**Translation:**  Many **Shramanas** (non-Jain monks) - **Ajainas**, **Buddha**, **Ajitakeshakambla**, **Sanjayvelatthiputra**, etc., monks of the **Shramana** tradition, and **Brahmanas** - **Brihaspati**, etc., followers of the **Brahmana** tradition - those within the **Brahmana** tradition, violate and reject these principles, remaining bound to their own doctrines. They are ignorant and remain attached to sensual pleasures.

**Commentary:**

After stating the authority for study, and explaining the **Sva-samaya** (own doctrine), the author now intends to explain the **Para-samaya** (other doctrines).

**Etan** (these) refers to the principles mentioned earlier. **Vyutkramya** (rejecting) and **Parityaajya** (abandoning) refer to those who reject the principles and create their own doctrines. **Satta:** (bound) - the word "Sita" is used here, meaning "bound" - not all, but some. **Eke** (some) - this indicates that not all, but some reject the principles. **Grantha-atikram** (violation of the principles) - this refers to their rejection of the principles mentioned earlier. **Anantara-grantha** (later texts) - this refers to the principles mentioned in later texts. **Tadyatha** (for example) - the principles mentioned in later texts are as follows: **Jiva-sattva** (the existence of the soul), **Jnana-avaran** (knowledge-obscuring karma), etc., **Karma-bandha** (the bondage of karma). **Tasy-hetu** (the causes of karma) - **Mithyatva** (false belief), **Avirati** (lack of restraint), **Pramada** (carelessness), etc., **Parigraha-arambha** (the beginning of attachment), etc. **Tat-trota** (the breaking of karma) - **Samyag-darshan** (right faith), etc., **Moksha-sadbhaav** (the possibility of liberation), etc.

**Eke Shramanas** (some monks) - **Shakyas**, etc., **Barhaspatya-mata-anusari** (followers of the Brihaspati doctrine), **Brahmanas** (Brahmanas) - these **Shramanas** and **Brahmanas** reject the principles mentioned by the **Arhats** (enlightened ones), and being ignorant of the ultimate truth, are bound to their own doctrines. **Vividham** (various) - **Anek-prakar** (many types) - **Ut-pravalya** (with great force) - **Sita** (bound) - **Sva-samaya** (their own doctrines).

**Self-Time Statement of Authority**

**Passage:**  "O Blessed One! Have you heard the wise say, 'Drink and eat, O handsome one! What has passed, O beautiful form, is not yours. Do not fear! What has passed does not return. This body is merely a collection.' Thus, those who are internally influenced by the meaning of self-time, having crossed over the meaning of the scriptures, which is the true meaning of the scriptures, are attached to their own scriptures and to desires."

**Commentary:**  The first study in the commentary includes the exposition of self-time - Jain principles, followed by the exposition of other-time - non-Jain principles. Therefore, after stating his own principles, the author of the scripture says:

Many men abandon the principles that have been discussed before and remain attached to scriptures created according to their own liking. The word "Aae-Eke" used in this verse means that not all are like this, some are. The intention of accepting the principles of the scriptures composed by them is that they transgress the aforementioned scriptures - Jain scriptures. The aforementioned scriptures have expounded the meaning - the implication that beings have their own independent existence, there is karma-bondage of knowledge-obscuration, etc., false belief, non-restraint, carelessness, attachment, beginning, etc., are the causes of their karma-bondage. This bondage breaks through the means of right faith, etc. As a result, liberation is attained. Some Shakyas - Buddhists, Shramanas, and Brahmanas following the principles of Brihaspati, etc., transgress - violate all the aforementioned principles spoken by the Tirthankaras, not knowing the ultimate truth - the ultimate reality or truth, and remain stubbornly attached to their own principles in many ways. The Shakyas expound:

There is no independent entity called the soul as the basis of happiness, sorrow, desire, aversion, and knowledge, but only a manifestation of knowledge manifests in various forms. All karmic formations - substances are momentary, fleeting.

Those who believe in the Sankhya philosophy explain their substances or elements in this way:

The state of equilibrium - equal state of sattva guna, rajo guna, and tamo guna is called nature. From nature, the great - intellect element arises. From intellect, ego arises. From ego, the group of sixteen elements arises. From that, the five great elements arise. The nature of the element called purusha or soul is consciousness or awareness.

Those who believe in the Vaisheshika philosophy explain:

Substance, quality, action, generality, particularity, and inherence are the six substances.

The Nyaya philosophers expound:

Liberation is attained through the knowledge of:

1. Anvaya - that which is present when something else is present.
2. Vyatireka - that which is absent when something else is absent.

The Mimamsakas say:

The protection of dharma is inspiration. Inspiration means Vedic sentences that reveal unknown meaning. Through it, the meaning of dharma, etc., is understood. There is no man called omniscient. That is, no one is omniscient. There is no existence - reality of liberation.

Anvaya is that which is present when something else is present. Vyatireka is that which is absent when something else is absent.

Page #36:
---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra - The Charvakas explain their doctrines as follows:

(There is no substance called soul that goes to the afterlife - obtains another existence after death - besides the five elements. There is no sin and no virtue. Accepting such doctrines, these Lokayatikas - those who consider this world as everything - Charvakas - those who believe in these doctrines - remain greedy, attached to desires - the pursuit of worldly pleasures and enjoyment. They address a woman in these words: "O auspicious one! This human world is only as much as is perceived by the senses, obtained. A man went out on a path. His footprint was marked on the path. Seeing it, an ignorant man says that this is the mark of a wolf's paw. Heaven, etc., are also such false imaginations born of ignorance. O beautiful one! - possessor of an excellent body, eat and drink well. What has passed is not yours. O naive one! What has gone does not return. This body is a collection or a combined mass of five elements."

Thus, those whose hearts are attached to their own doctrines do not know the ultimate truth. They transgress - abandon - the doctrines propounded by the Tirthankara Bhagwan, remain bound by the doctrines in their own scriptures, and indulge in sensual pleasures.

"There are five great elements, this is what they say. Earth, water, then wind, and the fifth is space." (7)

Commentary: "There are five great elements, these are the names given. Earth, water, fire, wind, and space are the five." (7)

Translation: The proponents of the five elements declare that earth, water, fire, wind, and space are the fundamental elements in this world.

Commentary: Here, the author of the sutra specifically refers to the Charvaka doctrine and says: "There are, and they are great, and they are elements, and they are great elements. They are great because they permeate all worlds. This refutes the doctrine of the non-existence of elements. 'Here' in this world, they are declared by the proponents of the elements. They are declared by the Tirthankaras, or by the proponents of the elements, who follow the Barhaspatya doctrine. They are accepted by themselves and declared by others. And these are: earth, which is hard; water, which is fluid; fire, which is hot; wind, which is mobile; and space, which is empty. And those who have these five, they are as they are. These are well-known and can be perceived by direct experience, so they cannot be refuted by anyone.

Now, the Samkhyas and others also accept elements. For example, the Samkhyas say: "From the three qualities of sattva, rajas, and tamas, the great one arises, which means intellect. From the great one arises ego - the feeling of 'I'. From ego arises the group of sixteen, which includes the five sense organs of touch, etc., the five organs of action - speech, hands, feet, anus, and genitals - the eleventh, mind, and the five subtle elements. These are: the subtle elements of smell, taste, form, touch, and sound. From the subtle element of smell arises earth, which has smell, taste, form, and touch. From the subtle element of taste arises water, which has taste, form, and touch. From the subtle element of form arises fire, which has form and touch. From the subtle element of touch arises wind, which has touch. From the subtle element of sound arises space, which is devoid of smell, taste, form, and touch."

Similarly, the Vaisheshikas also mention elements. For example, they say: "Earth arises from the quality of earthness. It is eternal, characterized by atoms. It is impermanent in the form of effects produced by the process of two atoms, etc. It has fourteen qualities: form, taste, smell, etc."

Page #37:
---------------------------
Earth, water, fire, air, and space are the five elements. They are pervasive in the world, hence the term "great elements" is used. This refutes the view of those who deny the existence of elements. 

Earth is characterized by solidity, water by fluidity, fire by heat, air by movement, and space by emptiness. These are well-known and can be perceived directly. Therefore, no one can deny their existence. 

Other schools of thought, such as the Samkhya, also accept the five elements. The Samkhya school states that the Mahat principle arises from the primordial nature, which is composed of the three qualities of sattva, rajas, and tamas. Mahat means intellect. From intellect arises ego, which is the feeling of "I am." From ego arises a group of sixteen elements: five sense organs (touch, taste, sight, smell, and hearing), five organs of action (speech, hands, feet, anus, and genitals), mind, and five subtle elements. The subtle elements are: smell, taste, form, touch, and sound. Earth arises from the subtle element of smell, and possesses the four qualities of smell, form, taste, and touch. Water arises from the subtle element of taste, and possesses the three qualities of taste, form, and touch. Fire arises from the subtle element of form, and possesses the two qualities of form and touch. Air arises from the subtle element of touch, and possesses the quality of touch. Space arises from the subtle element of sound, and is devoid of smell, taste, form, and touch.

Those who follow the Vaisheshika school also describe these elements. According to them, earth arises from the quality of earthiness. It is of two types: eternal and non-eternal. It is eternal in its atomic form, and non-eternal in its composite forms, such as molecules. It possesses fourteen qualities: form, taste, smell, touch, number, quantity, separateness, conjunction, disjunction, being, non-being, gravity, fluidity, and velocity. Water arises from the quality of wateriness. It possesses the qualities of form, taste, touch, number, quantity, separateness, conjunction, disjunction, being, non-being, gravity, and velocity.

Page #38:
---------------------------
## Sutra Kritanga Sutra

The earth element is composed of 14 qualities: natural fluidity, affection, and velocity. Its original form is white. Its taste is sweet and its touch is cool. Fire is produced from the element of fire or by the association of the quality of fire. It acquires 11 qualities: form, touch, number, quantity, separateness, combination, division, externality, internality, induced fluidity, and velocity. Its form is white, luminous, and its touch is hot. Air exists due to the association of the quality of air or the quality of air. It is neither hot nor cold to the touch. It possesses 9 qualities: number, quantity, separateness, combination, division, externality, internality, and velocity.  

The perception of space is through the vibration of the heart, the hearing of sound, and the touch that is neither hot nor cold. Space is a defined term in itself. It is one. It possesses the qualities of number, quantity, separateness, combination, division, and sound. Sound is its characteristic - it is perceived through sound.

**[Question]** Why are the five elements described in this way, when other philosophers also accept the existence of the five elements? This question arises in comparison to the Lokayata or Charvaka philosophy.

**[Answer]** According to the Sankhya and other philosophers, ego and other things are produced from nature. They accept many other things like time, direction, and soul. However, the Charvaka philosophy does not accept any other things besides the five elements, including the soul. Therefore, the explanation of the Sutra is given in comparison to their philosophy.

**[Verse 8]** These five elements are called one. With their destruction, the destruction of the embodied being occurs.

**[Commentary]** As it is, to show this, it is said: "These five elements..." The five elements, earth, etc., mentioned earlier, are called one because they are transformed into the body. There is no soul, separate from the elements, that is a form of consciousness. There is no other being, separate from the elements, that is imagined as a soul, a enjoyer of happiness and suffering, and a being called a living being. They say this. They also prove it this way: There is no soul separate from earth, etc., because there is no evidence to perceive it. The evidence here is only direct perception, not inference, etc. Because there is no direct connection of the object with the sense organ, there is a possibility of error. If there is a possibility of error, and there is a possibility of contradiction in similar things, then the characteristic itself would be faulty, and there would be doubt everywhere. As it is said:

"A person running on a rough path, with a hand touching something, etc., is not difficult to find a fallacy with inference as the main thing."

Inference here is also a sign of the path, etc., because there is no direct connection with the object, and the action is only through the touch of the hand. Therefore, direct perception is the only evidence. And by that, the soul, separate from the elements, is not perceived. Whatever consciousness is found in them, it is manifested in the elements themselves, transformed into the body.

It is said that the power of intoxication arises from the combination of ingredients in intoxicating drinks. Similarly, consciousness cannot be something other than the elements, because it is their function, just like a pot. Thus, since there is no self other than the elements, consciousness is merely a manifestation of the elements, like the bubbles in water. Some Lokayatikas accept that even space is an element, so the theory of five elements is not a fault.

But if there is no other substance called the self, distinct from the elements, then how can there be the designation of death? To this doubt, it is said:

"When the body form of these beings changes and consciousness manifests, then, upon the destruction of one of them, the destruction of the other, or both, the destruction of the embodied being, Devadatta, is accepted. Therefore, the designation of death arises, not the destruction of the soul." This is the argument of the proponent of consciousness distinct from the elements.

To refute this, the author of the text says:

"The five elements, along with their other qualities, are the cause of consciousness. The five sense organs do not perceive anything other than the five elements." [33]

Here, the statement "the five elements, along with their other qualities, are the cause of consciousness" is a declaration. The other statements are presented as reasons, and the example is implied, as it is easily understood.

Therefore, the Charvaka should be asked:

"What is this consciousness that manifests from the combination of the elements? Is it independent of them, or is it dependent on them?"

Now, it cannot be independent, because it is said:

"The other qualities of the elements are the cause of consciousness." [33]

For example, the quality of hardness is the quality of earth, the quality of fluidity is the quality of water, the quality of burning is the quality of fire, the quality of movement is the quality of air, and the quality of pervasiveness is the quality of space. Or, as mentioned earlier, the qualities of smell, etc., are the qualities of earth, etc. Each of these qualities is distinct from consciousness. The word "and" indicates the possibility of another alternative. Since the qualities of earth, etc., exist, and the quality of consciousness does not exist in each of them, nor in their combination, the quality of consciousness cannot be established.

The example here is:

The combination of elements is taken as the subject of the argument, and it does not have the quality of consciousness. This is because the quality of consciousness is the quality of other elements. The combination of any other qualities does not produce a new quality. For example, the quality of oil, which is the quality of smoothness, does not arise in a combination of sand. Similarly, the quality of a pillar, etc., does not arise in a combination of a pot and a cloth. It is observed that consciousness is present in the body, and it will be the quality of the self, not of the elements.

The author presents another reason for the same conclusion:

"The five sense organs do not perceive anything other than the five elements." [33]

The five sense organs are touch, taste, sight, smell, and hearing. Their locations are the spaces where they reside. Since they do not have the quality of consciousness, consciousness does not arise from the combination of elements.

The heart of this argument is:

The Lokayatikas do not accept the existence of a separate perceiver. They believe that the sense organs themselves are the perceivers. Their locations are the material causes of perception. Since they are non-conscious, consciousness does not arise from the combination of elements.

The locations of the sense organs are:

The sense of hearing is located in space, because space is hollow. The sense of smell is located in earth, because it is its essence. The sense of sight is located in fire, because it is its form. Similarly, the sense of taste is located in water, and the sense of touch is located in air.

The example here is:

The sense organs are capable of perception. Since they are caused by non-conscious qualities, whatever is caused by non-conscious qualities is non-conscious, like a pot and a cloth. Thus, the absence of consciousness in the combination of elements is established.

The author presents another reason:

"The sense organs do not perceive anything other than the five elements." [33]

Each sense organ is made up of an element. Since there is no separate perceiver, they are the perceivers. Each sense organ perceives its own object and does not perceive the object of another sense organ. Therefore, no sense organ knows another sense organ. Thus, the idea of a self that knows all five objects does not arise. It is experienced that there must be a single perceiver, and it is his consciousness, not the consciousness of the combination of elements.

The example here is:

Consciousness does not arise from the combination of elements, because the sense organs, which are caused by it, perceive only their own objects. If one sense organ could perceive the object of another sense organ, then Devadatta's perception would also be perceived by Yajnadatta. But this is not observed.

Now, if the argument is based on independence, then there is a fault. If, on the other hand, the argument is based on the dependence of the elements on each other, and the quality of consciousness arises from the combination of elements, then how can there be any fault?

The answer to this is:

It has been said that consciousness arises from the combination of elements, which are dependent on each other. Let us consider this: Is this combination different from the elements that combine?

---------------------------
Is the Sutra-kritanga Sutra a single entity or different? If it is different, then there is the implication of six substances. And there is no other proof for you to accept a substance called "samyoga" (combination) other than the five elements, because you accept only perception as proof. And because of that, there is no acceptance of it. And if you accept another proof, then there will be no acceptance of the soul. If it is not different from the elements, then this should also be considered: Are the elements each conscious or unconscious? If they are conscious, then there is the implication of one sense organ, and also the implication of five kinds of consciousness in the aggregate. If they are unconscious, then there is the previously mentioned fault. For if that which is not present in each part is not found in the aggregate, then it is like sand and oil, etc. And what is said here, "Just as the power of intoxication is not present in each part of the body, but appears in the aggregate," is also not right. Because the power that is found in yeast, etc., is like this: the power to remove hunger in yeast, the power to cause fermentation, the power to remove thirst in water, etc. And if you accept that the elements are each conscious, then there is a difference between the example and the thing being explained. Moreover, if you accept that the elements are conscious, then there is no death. Because the elements like earth, etc., are present even in a dead body. This is not true. Because death is present due to the absence of air or fire in a dead body. This is the talk of an uneducated person. Because the absence of air is not perceived in a dead body, and because of the perception of the nature of cooking in boiling, fire is not absent. If you say that some subtle air or fire has gone away, then the soul is accepted by another name. This is all that is. And if consciousness arises only from the aggregate of elements, then consciousness is not perceived even when earth, etc., are arranged together. If you say that it is manifested when the body is formed, then that is also not right. Because even when all the elements are present in a clay image, only inertness is perceived. Thus, by considering the presence and absence, this quality called consciousness should not belong to the elements. And it is perceived in bodies. Therefore, by the process of elimination, this belongs to the soul. So, discarding your own viewpoint, accept this. And what was said before, "I am not different from earth, etc., because there is no proof to accept it, and perception is the only proof here," etc., is refuted here. Because what is said, "Perception is the only proof, not inference, etc.," is the statement of a teacher who has not been followed. Because proof is said to be that which is not contradictory to the object. And the validity of perception is established like this: Some instances of perception are accepted as valid by the proof, "These are proofs because they are not contradictory to the object, like the instances of perception that have been experienced." And these instances of perception themselves, which are known to themselves, cannot be used to prove anything else. Because perception is mute due to its being confined to its own knowledge. And if inference is proof, then how can a Carvaka, who does not refute inference, be insane? He would refute its validity like this: "Inference is not proof because it is contradictory to the object, like the instances of inference that have been experienced." And this is also inference. If you say that this is said by common knowledge, then that is also not right. Because is that common knowledge inference proof or not proof? If it is proof, then how is inference said to be not proof? If it is not proof, then how can someone be convinced by something that is not proof? If you say that it is accepted by someone else as valid, then that is also not right. If someone, due to foolishness, considers something that is not proof to be proof, then is that accepted by you, who is very intelligent? If someone thinks that poison is a sweet substance, then is that accepted by an intelligent person who is about to kill him? Thus, you, who are establishing the validity and invalidity of perception and inference, are forced to accept the validity of inference even though you do not want to. And what proof do you use to deny heaven, liberation, and deities? Perception cannot be used to deny them. Because does perception deny something that is present or something that is not present? It cannot deny something that is present because it is contradictory to its being the object of absence. And it cannot deny something that is not present because it does not exist, and therefore there is no perception. This is not logical. Because if something that pervades is absent, then the pervaded is also absent. And the perception of a Carvaka cannot be considered to pervade all objects. How can the absence of an object be established by the absence of perception? Thus, you, who are denying heaven, etc., are definitely accepting another proof. And because you accept the knowledge of another's opinion, another proof is clearly accepted here. Otherwise, how could a Carvaka have composed scriptures to teach others? This is enough of this implication. Thus, there is another proof besides perception. By that, the soul will be established. If you ask, "What is that?", then it is said: There is a soul because of the perception of its unique qualities, like the eye sense organ. The eye sense organ is directly perceived. The touch sense organ, etc., are inferred by their power to produce knowledge of form, etc., which is common. Similarly, the soul is also inferred by its unique qualities, which are different from earth, etc.

Page #41:
---------------------------
It is inferred that the self has the power of self-awareness, which is a quality of consciousness. Consciousness is an extraordinary quality, and its existence in the aggregate of earth and other elements is established by the fact that it is not refuted. Similarly, the self exists because there is a perception of the collection of all objects perceived by the senses, like Devadatta, who is perceived as one by the five senses, each of which perceives a different aspect. Similarly, the self exists because the senses are the instruments of perception, and even when they are absent, the objects perceived by them are remembered, just as Devadatta is remembered even after the window is closed, because he was perceived through the window. Similarly, the existence of the self is also established by inference. For example, in the aggregate of earth and other elements, there is no existence of actions like attachment, karma, etc., and therefore, by inference, there must be a substance that is the common cause of actions like happiness, sorrow, desire, aversion, effort, etc., which is different from the elements, and that is the self. Thus, other inferences based on perception, inference, etc., are also to be considered, and their characteristic is:

**"Sixfold knowledge is the proof, where the object is not otherwise. If one postulates another unseen object, that is called inference."** (1)

Similarly, the existence of the self is also established by scripture, which says, **"There is a self, as the scriptures declare."** If one doubts this, then the self is established by the highest proof, perception, which is the most reliable of all proofs. The self is perceived because its qualities are knowledge, and knowledge is not different from its possessor. The self is perceived just as a cloth is perceived by the perception of its qualities like color, etc. For example, I am happy, I am sorrowful, I am this, I am that, and I am the self, which is directly perceived. I am directly aware of myself, because I am the form of self-awareness. My body is old, my actions are old, and I am different from my body, because I am described as being different from my body. Thus, many other proofs are also to be considered in establishing the existence of the self.

The statement, **"There is no consciousness other than the elements, because it is their effect, like a pot,"** is not appropriate, because the reason is not established. For example, consciousness is not the effect of the elements, because they do not have the quality of consciousness, and it is impossible to perceive the collection of consciousness as the effect of the elements. Thus, the self exists, and it is the basis of knowledge, which is different from the elements.

Now, if the self is the basis of knowledge, and it is different from knowledge, then how can it be the support of knowledge, since knowledge itself will be the cause of all perception, etc.? Or, is the self a mere concept within knowledge? For example, since knowledge is itself the form of consciousness, and it is related to the elements, which are inanimate and have the form of the body, then actions like happiness, sorrow, desire, aversion, effort, etc., arise, and there is perception, and there is movement from one life to another. Thus, if this is the case, then what is the need for the self?

It is said that the self is the one basis, and without it, perception does not occur. For example, when each sense perceives its own object, and it is inclined towards another object, then there is no one perceiver, and therefore, all objects are perceived as one, and there is no perception of the self. If it is said that there is one consciousness, the storehouse consciousness, then even in this case, the self is established, because it is the basis of this consciousness. And, the quality of knowledge cannot exist without its possessor, and therefore, the self, which is the possessor, must exist. And, it is all-pervasive, because its quality is not perceived in any place, like a pot. And, it is not as small as a grain of rice or as big as a thumb joint, because it pervades the body, which is acquired. And, it is perceived as pervading the body, from the skin to the end. Therefore, it is established that the self pervades the body, from the acquired body to the skin. And, since it is connected to karma, which is beginningless, it does not remain in the form of the self in the worldly existence, and therefore, even though it is formless, its connection with karma, which is formed, is not contradictory. And, due to the connection with karma, there are many different states, like subtle, gross, one-sense, two-sense, three-sense, four-sense, five-sense, etc., which arise. And, if it is completely momentary, then there will be no meditation, study, effort, or recognition. And, if it is completely eternal, then there will be no change in the states of hell, animal, human, and god. Therefore, it is not eternal, and it is not non-eternal, and therefore, it is the self. This is the excessive conclusion. (8)

**Commentary:**

The author of the Charvaka philosophy, taking the phrase **"These five great elements,"** argues that first, the five great elements, earth, etc., are discussed. When they combine and become the body, then from those five great elements, a self, which is the form of consciousness and knowledge, arises. They say that there is no other being or self, which other philosophers postulate, and that it does not go to the other world, it does not get a new birth after death, and it does not experience happiness and sorrow. They prove this by saying that there is no other substance called the self, apart from the elements, because there is no proof of its existence.

---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** teaches that the only valid proof is **direct perception (pratyaksha)**.  Other proofs accepted by other philosophies, such as **inference (anumana)**, **scriptural authority (agama)**, and **comparison (upamana)**, are not valid because they do not involve direct contact between the object of knowledge (pramaya) and the sense organ. This lack of direct contact leaves room for error, leading to a distorted understanding of the object of knowledge, making it unreliable. 

It is like a blind man walking on a rough and uneven path, relying only on touch. It is not impossible for him to fall. Similarly, those who rely on inference or other proofs to understand reality are prone to error. This applies to **agama** as well, as it also lacks direct contact between the object of knowledge and the sense organ. Therefore, only **direct perception** is a reliable source of knowledge.

According to this philosophy, the soul (atma) cannot be directly perceived by the senses. The consciousness (chaitanya) that we experience is a product of the five elements (panchamahabut) coming together. Just as the ingredients of wine produce its intoxicating effect when combined, consciousness is not a separate entity from the five elements. It is a function of them, just as the function of a pot is a result of the clay. Therefore, consciousness is not a separate entity from the five elements. It is a manifestation of them, just as bubbles appear on water.

Some may question the inclusion of space (akasha) as one of the five elements, as traditionally only earth, water, fire, and air are considered. The commentator clarifies that some Charvaka philosophers also consider space as an element, making the inclusion of five elements valid.

If there is no separate soul (atma) distinct from the five elements, then why do we say that a person has died? The commentator explains that consciousness is a manifestation of the five elements in the form of a body. When one of these elements, such as air or fire, is destroyed, we say that the person has died. This does not mean that a separate soul has left the body. It is simply a change in the combination of the five elements.

The commentator further clarifies that the five elements, even when combined to form a body, cannot produce consciousness. The word "adi" (meaning "etc.") used in conjunction with consciousness refers to qualities or actions like speech, movement, and walking, which are not produced by the five elements. This is the commentator's assertion. The word "adi" in this context is used in a general sense, and the reader should be able to understand its meaning through their own experience.

## Self-Time Statement of Authority

In this regard, the question should be asked of the Charvaka - this question can be asked - when these great elements combine, the power of consciousness-awareness is expressed, then does it manifest independently when these elements combine, or does it manifest dependently when they combine? What is the meaning of asking this, the solution is as follows - the power of consciousness of the five great elements is not capable of manifesting independently, that is, none of them can manifest consciousness, keeping that in mind, the proponent says, "Aṇṇaguṇāṇoceti" by this word, that these five great elements are not endowed with the quality of consciousness, but are endowed with other qualities. In other words, earth etc. have their own qualities, which are different from consciousness. To be the basis of matter, to be hard, is the quality of earth. The quality of water is fluidity or liquidity, the quality of fire is the power of digestion or digestion. The quality of air is movement - mobility, the quality of space is space - space or place. Or it can be said - those mentioned earlier, they are the qualities of earth etc., respectively, one by one, abandoning - abandoning smell etc. qualities. These qualities are distinct from consciousness. Thus, earth etc. elements have other qualities different from consciousness. The use of the word 'c' in this verse indicates the statement related to the second option. The Charvaka want to prove the origin of consciousness from earth etc., but the five great elements of earth etc. have their own qualities - other than consciousness. Thus, when none of the substances from earth etc. have the quality of consciousness, then the emergence of the quality of consciousness from their combination cannot be proved. This can be understood by the method of experiment or inference. The community of elements - the five great elements are independent, therefore they are taken as the Dharmipaksa, and the quality of those elements is not consciousness, this is the Sadhya Dharma. The qualities of earth etc. are different from consciousness, they are different, this is the reason. In the community or group of substances with other qualities, the unprecedented quality that is not already present in them, does not arise, for example, oil cannot be produced from the community of sand grains, which is endowed with the quality of smoothness. Similarly, pillars etc. cannot be produced from the community of pots and clothes. The quality of consciousness is visible - experienced in the body, it may be the quality of the soul, not of the five great elements.

To prove the same, the proponent presents another reason - the five senses of touch, taste, smell, sight, hearing, and cognition, which are the locations or causes, lack the quality of consciousness, they are devoid of consciousness. Then consciousness is impossible in the community of elements. The meaning here is - the Charvaka do not consider anyone else besides the senses as the seer - the one who sees, the one who knows. According to their theory, the senses are the seer or the knower. The materials that are the original causes of those senses are achitt - not cognitive or conscious. Therefore, the community of conscious elements - the five great elements cannot be their quality. The location - the original cause or the original cause of the senses is as follows - the location of the auditory sense is space, because the auditory sense is hollow - hollow or empty-rooted. The original cause of the olfactory sense or the nose is earth because it is earth-like in terms of vitality. The original cause of the eye is light or fire, because the eye is light-like or luminous. Similarly, the original cause of the taste sense is water and the original cause of the touch sense is wind.

1. What is transformed into the form of work is called the original cause, for example, the original cause of the pot is clay.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

Here, inference should be used in this way: The senses are not endowed with attainment - the conscious power to control the object of attainment is not of the senses, because they are derived from substances that do not have the quality of consciousness. Whatever is derived from unconscious, non-conscious substances, is all endowed with unconscious qualities, like a pot, a cloth, etc. Thus, the absence or non-existence of consciousness in the five great elements is proven.

The commentator then presents another reason to prove this: Each of the senses has a physical form derived from the elements. According to the Charvaka doctrine, no other seer-knower is considered. The senses themselves are the seers. They individually perceive their respective objects. An object that can be known or perceived by one sense cannot be known by another sense besides that one. In such a situation, I have known the five objects - I have experienced the objects of the five senses. This collective, combined, or unitary knowledge is not obtained or experienced, but it is actually experienced in life. From this, it appears that there must be a seer or knower different from the senses. Consciousness is its quality, not of the five elements.

Again, this topic is clarified here by another method of inference: The five elements do not have the quality of consciousness in their aggregate, because the senses derived from those elements have the capacity to perceive their respective objects - they perceive one object related to each of them, but they cannot perceive the collective, combined knowledge of all five. If one sense could know what another sense has perceived or known, then if Devadatta knew a certain object or idea, Yajnadutta would also know it, but this is not visible, because another man cannot know an object known and experienced by one man.

Thus, a doubt arises: Independently, none of the five elements have the quality of consciousness. If this is accepted, then this fault is proven, but when the five great elements are mutually relative, then due to their mutual combination or union, the quality of consciousness arises in a new form, just as the ingredients of wine, like yeast and water, etc., do not have this power or intoxication, but when they combine, the intoxicating power, which was absent in each individually, arises. If this happens, where is the scope or possibility for the above-mentioned fault?

The answer lies in the 'ch' sound used in the above verse of the commentary: You said that consciousness arises from the mutual, relative combination of the five elements. We present this solution through this alternative: The combination by which the five great elements produce the quality of consciousness is either different or separate from those combiners, the mutually combining great elements, or it is not different or separate. If you consider that combination to be different from them, then it will become a sixth element in addition to the five, but according to your view, there is no sixth element called combination in addition to the five elements - it is unproven. You only accept direct perception as evidence, and that direct perception evidence does not reveal combination or prove its existence. If you accept the acceptance of combination through another evidence, then the existence of living beings can also be accepted through that other evidence.

If you consider combination to be not different or separate from the five elements, then it is still debatable whether each element is conscious or unconscious. If each element is considered to be conscious by all five elements, then one sense is proven, i.e., one sense alone, due to its consciousness, perceives different objects.

The ability to perceive is acquired. In such a situation, the consciousness of the body, which is born from the community of the five elements, will be potentially of five types.

If each element is considered to be unconscious, then a difficulty arises - how can the quality that is not present in any one of the five be obtained in their community? Just as oil is not produced from grains of sand. Just as there is no oil in a single grain of sand, so there cannot be oil in many grains of sand combined.

•

It is also not reasonable to say, as the Charvaka said, that the intoxicating power of intoxication is produced when they are combined, even though it is not present in each part of the liquor, because the intoxicating power of intoxication is present in some form in the ferment, etc. The ferment has the power to quench or remove hunger. Its consumption causes dizziness in the head. Water has the power to quench thirst. Therefore, the intoxication that resides in liquor does not come from outside. If it is assumed that there is no consciousness in any of the five elements, then the analogy and the example do not prove to be similar. The meaning of analogy is to present a subject by way of example. The meaning of example is the event mentioned in the example. If there is no consciousness in the analogy and it is mentioned in the example, then they do not occur together - they are opposite. If the elements are accepted as conscious, then the state of death cannot arise. Even in a dead body, the existence of earth, etc. elements remains. If you say that this does not happen because there is a lack of air and fire in the dead body, therefore death occurs, then saying so is merely the ravings of an uneducated, ignorant man, because swelling is found in the dead body - swelling is caused by air, therefore the lack of air in the dead body cannot be considered. There is also the function of fire in that body, which is of the nature of digestion or digestion, because pus or pus is produced in it. Therefore, the non-existence of fire in it cannot be considered. If you say that such air, which is subtle, such fire, which is subtle, which has the power to sustain life, leaves the dead body, therefore death occurs. Saying so is to accept the soul or the soul by another name. Therefore, this is not a different or another device.

1

Consciousness cannot be produced from the group of elements even by their combination, because if we arrange the five elements, earth, etc., in one place, make one mind, then consciousness is not available from them. If you say that consciousness is expressed only when these five elements are transformed into the form of a body, then this also does not seem right, because if a body shape is made by plastering lime, etc., on a wall, etc., then even though all the elements exist in it, only inertness - unconsciousness is available. Thus, by criticizing by analogy and difference, it is not proved that the quality called consciousness is present in the five elements. It is obtained in the body in its entirety. Due to the pervasiveness of the soul in the body, it is proved to be the quality of the soul. Leave your own philosophical principles or opinions and accept this.

As the Lokayatika has previously stated, there is no element called soul, distinct from the elements of earth, etc., because no evidence of that soul is found.

---------------------------
The Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra is the only valid direct perception. Its counter-argument is as follows: Direct perception is the only valid proof. Inference and other types of proofs are not included. This statement may be made by someone who has not worshipped the Guru or studied the scriptures in the Guru's presence. That which reveals the true nature of an object or substance is called proof. The validity of direct perception is proven as follows: Take any direct perceivers as righteous or partisan, then their validity is proven as follows: 'This is proof' because they are not inconsistent with the meaning - they do not contradict it. They do not present it otherwise, they present it in its true form. For example, we are directly seeing a person.

The person who has been directly seen, known, is known in his own soul, but he who has seen directly cannot behave in the same way towards another person, he cannot show it directly because what he has seen is contained in the knowledge of the perceivers, the knowledge of direct perception does not speak, it is silent.

Inference is not proof - this statement of the Charvakas is also based on inference. Then if he refutes inference, it is like the talk of a madman. If it is said that the Charvakas consider inference to be invalid - they cannot accept it as proof because inference is not proof. It is inconsistent with the meaning - it does not reveal it in its true form. For example, experiencing - knowing - a person through inference - but this is also an inference.

If you say that other philosophers consider inference to be proof, therefore, based on their belief, we also take recourse to inference and refute inference on the basis of that inference, it is not reasonable to say so. It can be asked whether the inference famous in other philosophies is proof or non-proof in your view. If you consider it to be proof, then there is no situation to call inference invalid. If you consider it to be invalid, then how do you convince others on its basis? If you say that the other considers inference to be proof, therefore, he can be convinced - explained - by inference, it is also unreasonable to say so. If any other man accepts the invalid as proof due to foolishness, then why do you, being very skilled - competent - try to convince him by means of that invalid? If an ignorant - ignorant man considers jaggery to be poison, does any intelligent person try to give him jaggery to kill him? Does he himself act ignorantly in accordance with his ignorance? Therefore, accepting direct perception as proof and not accepting inference as proof, even though you do not want to, the validity of inference forcefully comes to you.

You have denied heaven and liberation, by what proof do you prove that hell and liberation exist? They cannot be denied by direct perception. Tell me, does direct perception, being present in heaven and liberation, deny them or, being absent, reject them? Direct perception cannot deny heaven and hell by being present because it contradicts the non-existent object, in other words, how can there be a tendency of direct perception in that which does not exist, you do not believe in the existence of heaven and liberation, then there is no situation for direct perception to be present in them. Direct perception denies heaven and liberation by being absent, this is also not possible because when heaven and liberation are directly

---------------------------
The statement of self-time is not available. How can there be cessation in them when there is no direct perception? Thus, it is not possible for direct perception to determine them in both the present and the past states.
The situation is this - when the pervasive substance ceases, the pervaded substance is also considered to cease, but the direct evidence that shows the present object is not pervasive in all things. This means that it cannot know all things, it only knows the present. Therefore, when direct perception ceases, how can it be known that the substance which it cannot know independently or which is not directly perceived, exists? The denial of heaven etc. by the Charvakas through the means of direct evidence also proves that the Charvakas accept another evidence besides direct perception. The Charvakas accept the opinion of others as knowledge. This makes it clear that they accept another evidence besides direct perception. If this were not the case, why did the Charvakas create scriptures to make others understand their doctrines? Thus, it is not necessary to elaborate on this subject further.
From this discussion, it is proved that there is another evidence besides direct perception. The existence of that evidence is proved. What is that evidence? It is said - the soul - because it has an extraordinary, unusual or specific quality. The example of the eye sense is being given for this. The eye sense is very subtle and fine, therefore it is not directly available. Its existence can be inferred from the expectation of the ability to know the form of science, which cannot be obtained by the senses of touch etc. Similarly, the independent existence of the soul can be inferred from the expectation of consciousness, which is not found in the earth etc. elements. Consciousness is the extraordinary, unusual or only quality of the soul. The quality of consciousness is not found in the combination of the five elements of earth etc. Therefore, it is a matter of knowing that the soul exists. Certainly the soul exists, because all the senses know the objects - ideas, which are collectively - combined - knowledge or perception. For example, there are five windows in a building. A man named Devadatta sees the five objects known by them collectively. Similarly, the soul, not the senses, has a collective - combined - direct perception of the objects of knowledge by the senses. Even when the senses are destroyed, the objects known by them remain in the memory of the soul, just as the objects spoken by the windows remain in the memory of the person named Devadatta even when the windows are destroyed.
The existence of the soul is also proved by the evidence of inference. If the earth etc. five elements create a human form on a wall etc., then it does not have actions like happiness-suffering, desire, hatred and effort. This makes it certain that there is a substance other than the five elements, which is the material cause of happiness-suffering, desire, etc. actions - without which the work cannot be done. It is different from the five elements, it is the soul. Thus, the soul is proved by direct perception and inference etc. as well as by inference. This should be understood. The definition of inference is as follows - according to all six evidences, a substance which cannot be proved without another substance, is imagined to be an unseen substance for its proof, it is called inference. And the soul is also proved by argument, this should be known. The scriptures mention - my soul is उपपात

The Sutra Kritanga Sutra states that the soul goes to the other world or to a new life. What is the need to search for another proof to prove the soul? The soul is proven by the most senior or best proof among all proofs because knowledge is the attribute of the soul which is direct. The attribute is not different from the attributed, the knowledge attribute is not different from the soul attribute, it is inseparable. Therefore, the soul is direct in the same way as the directness of the cloth etc. attributes from the directness of the form etc. attributes. I am happy, I am sad, in this way, the language where "I" is used, the soul is directly perceived by the knowledge of "I" because the knowledge of "I" is the form of self-knowledge, the form of the soul, it is the knowledge of the soul. It is my body, it is my old karma, etc., the way it is directed, it indicates the difference of the soul from the body. Similarly, there are other proofs that prove the soul.
Charvaka said that consciousness is nothing but the elements, it is not different from the elements because it is the function of the elements, just as the pot etc. are the functions of the clay etc., this statement is also inappropriate and illogical because it has the fallacy of the reason, consciousness is not the function of the elements because it is not their attribute, this has already been explained. If consciousness is considered to be the function of the elements, then the knowledge of the five senses or the five objects cannot be achieved, this proves that the soul is the basis of knowledge, separate from the elements.
Another doubt is raised. What is the need to know the soul, the basis of knowledge, or the soul different from knowledge, because with the help of knowledge, the all-encompassing perception or the collective knowledge can be achieved, therefore, what is the need to believe in a useless soul like the fat glands on the body, like a boil? Everything can be contained in knowledge, which is like this - knowledge is conscious. When it is related to the elements, which are devoid of consciousness, changing in the form of the body, then actions like happiness, sorrow, desire, hatred, effort, etc. arise. The same is perceived by the collective perception or the collective knowledge. The same knowledge goes to the other world. In this way, all the subjects are well-organized and well-known. Then why is it necessary to hypothesize the soul?
The solution is this - the collective perception or the collective knowledge cannot be the basis of knowledge without believing in the soul, which is different from or separate from knowledge. Each sense organ perceives its own object, a different sense organ does not perceive the object of another sense organ. In such a situation, in the absence of a soul, the knower who perceives all the objects, I have understood all the five objects, this collective perception or knowledge does not happen.
If it is said that there is a principle called Alaya-vijnana, then that collective knowledge can happen, then the answer is this - you have renamed the soul as Alaya-vijnana. In fact, it is the soul. The knowledge attribute cannot exist without the attributed, therefore, its soul attribute is definitely desired, it should be.
The soul is not omnipresent because its attribute, knowledge, is not available everywhere. The pot is an example of this. The soul is like a grain of black gram, some people say this.

---------------------------
The statement of self-time is like the joints of the thumb, some people say. This is not so, because if the soul were so small, it could not be present in the body it has obtained due to its own past karma. That soul is found pervading from all the limbs to the skin. This creates a situation that proves that the soul is pervading the entire body up to the skin.
The soul that is in the state of samsara is bound by karma from time immemorial. It is not established in its own nature - it is not situated. Therefore, despite being formless, it has a relationship with the form of karma. There is no obstacle in it. Due to being bound with karma, it passes through many types of states, such as subtle, gross, one-sense, two-sense, three-sense, four-sense, five-sense, sufficient and insufficient.
If the soul is momentary in its solitary form, then meditation, study, effort and recognition etc. do not occur in it - they do not last. If it is considered eternal in its solitary form, then it cannot be transformed into the states of hell, animal, human and god. Therefore, the soul is eternal in one respect and non-eternal in another. More elaboration is needed in this regard.
Just as one stupa of the earth appears in many ways, so too, O friend, the whole world appears in many ways.
Commentary - Now the author presents the monism or non-dualism discussed earlier under the discussion of the first proposition as the opposing view. To understand the meaning of the statement, an example is given. The word "yathā" indicates an example, and the word "cha" means "and". It should be seen after the words "different order" and "one". The stupa of the earth is the real stupa of the earth, the group of earth, the constituent part, and even though it is one, it appears in many forms - it is seen as diverse due to being the basis of rivers, seas, mountains, cities, settlements, etc., or it is seen as diverse due to being low, high, soft, hard, red, yellow, etc. But there is no difference in the earth element due to this difference. In the same way, "O friend", the whole world - conscious and unconscious - is one wise being. This is the heart of the matter - the one soul, the wise being, the mass of knowledge, appears in many forms like earth, etc., and there is no difference in the soul element due to this. Thus it is said:
"One is the soul of beings, established in every being. It is seen in one way and in many ways, like water and the moon."
And "This whole thing, whatever is wonderful, whatever is to be, the lord of immortality, whatever grows by food, whatever moves, whatever does not move, whatever is far, whatever is near, whatever is within, whatever is outside of all this, is indeed the Purusha." This is dualism.

The **Sri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** uses examples to help understand the nature of things. This verse presents an example, indicated by the word "yathā". The word "cha" here is used in the sense of "api" and indicates a different order. Therefore, it should be placed after the word "eke".

The verse mentions the earth stupa, which is a group of earth elements, one. However, it appears in different forms based on rivers, oceans, mountains, cities, and suburbs, or it appears in different forms like low, high, soft, hard, red, yellow, etc. Despite these differences, the essence of the earth element remains the same.

Similarly, in this conscious and unconscious world, there is only one knowledge-filled soul. This means that the same knowledge-filled soul is seen in different forms in the earth and other elements, but there is no difference in the actual nature of that soul. It is said that the same soul exists in all beings, appearing in many forms like the moon reflected in water. The Upanishads say that everything that exists in this world, everything that will come into existence, is the same Purusha or soul. That soul resides in the divine, and it manifests in the form of the world for the enjoyment of beings. It is mobile, immobile, distant, and near. It is within everyone and outside everyone. Thus, the discussion of the principle of soul-non-duality ends.

**Translation of the verse:**

"They say, 'There is only one,' those who are weak and rely on the beginning. Some, by doing evil themselves, bring upon themselves intense suffering." (10)

**Commentary:**

This verse explains the principle of soul-non-duality. Some people, who are weak in understanding and rely on the beginning of the world, say that there is only one soul. However, the reality is that those who are attached to the beginning of actions, like violence, create evil karma and suffer its consequences. Others do not suffer.

The verse emphasizes that those who engage in harmful actions are the ones who experience intense suffering. It also implies that if there were only one soul, then everyone would suffer, even those who perform good actions. This is not the case, as only those who engage in harmful actions experience suffering.

---------------------------
(The statement of the right time) Because of the oneness of the soul, it is not seen like this. For example, whoever is a doer of unrighteousness, he alone experiences the corresponding ridicule in the world, not another. Similarly, in the omnipresence of the soul, there would be no bondage or liberation, and due to the absence of distinction between the teacher and the taught, there would be no creation of scriptures. Because of the relevance of this meaning, the previous verse is explained here, as follows: In the five elements, earth etc., which have transformed into a body form, consciousness is perceived. If, however, there is only one soul, which is all-pervasive, then consciousness would be perceived in pots etc. as well. But this is not the case. Therefore, there is not one soul. And the different qualities of the elements would not exist, because of the non-differentiation of the one soul. Similarly, in the case of the five sense organs and the five sense-based knowledge, if there is only one soul, then the knowledge known by one would also be known by another, and this would not be the case. ||10||

Page #52:
---------------------------
- The Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra states that if the soul is one and all-pervading, then it would not be possible for one to know what another knows.
A leaf came to the Kasina, a child, a wise one.
There are no souls, there are no souls, there are no souls. ||11||
Shadow - Each and every one of the soul, those who are children and those who are wise.
There are souls after death, but they are not souls, there are no souls.
Translation - In this world, the soul of all those who are children, ignorant, wise, and knowledgeable, is separate and distinct, not one. After death, the soul does not exist, and only the souls of the beings who are born again exist - they do not go to the other world.
Commentary - The author of the text presents the view of those who believe in the body as the soul as the opposing view. The view of those who believe in the body as the soul is that consciousness arises or manifests from the five elements that have transformed into the form of the body. Therefore, in each body, there is a separate soul. All souls exist in this form. Those who are children or ignorant, devoid of knowledge, and those who know the difference between good and bad, the wise, are all separate. One should not accept that there is one soul that pervades all. Accepting this would lead to the impossibility of distinguishing between the knowledgeable and the ignorant.
Now, fearing that the multiplicity of souls due to their being in each body might be objectionable, the author says, "There are souls" - they exist as long as the body exists, but they do not exist when the body does not exist. For example, consciousness arises in the elements that have transformed into the form of the body, and consciousness disappears when the collection of elements disintegrates. Consciousness is not found elsewhere. This is what the author is showing by saying, "There are no souls" - "After death" in the other world, there are no souls. The meaning is that there is no soul called "soul" that is different from the body and enjoys the fruits of its own actions.
Why is this so? The author says, "There are no souls" - the word "are" is a negation of the word "are" and should be understood in the plural. The meaning is that "there are no souls" - there are no souls who have been born again, because they are not born again, they do not go to another world. For example, the scripture says, "These beings arise from the mass of consciousness, and they perish along with them. There is no consciousness after death."
Now, what is the difference between the view of those who believe in the elements and the view of those who believe in the body as the soul? The author says, "The view of those who believe in the elements is that the elements themselves, which have transformed into the form of the body, perform actions like running, jumping, etc. The view of those who believe in the body as the soul is that consciousness, the soul, arises or manifests from the elements that have transformed into the form of the body, and it is inseparable from them." This is the difference. ||11||
_Commentary - The author of the text presents the view of those who believe in the body as the soul as the opposing view.

## Self-Time Statement of Authority

Those who believe in the principles propounded by the Arhats, while accepting the principle of 'Atmabahutva' (plurality of souls), believe that each body has a separate soul. Why then do you present this doctrine? This doubt arises. It is said that as long as the body exists, so does the soul. When the body ceases to exist, the soul also ceases to exist, because consciousness arises from the five great elements transformed into the form of the body. When the community of the five elements disintegrates and becomes separate, consciousness is lost and destroyed. Consciousness does not become available or visible, separated from the body and going elsewhere. The Agamkaras are to show the view of the Tatchiva Tatcharirvadi theorists.

Why is there no substance or element called soul separate from the body, which obtains Pretyabhava (afterlife), dies, goes to the other world, or takes rebirth and enjoys the fruits of its actions? Keeping this question in mind, it is said - Natthi Satthovvaiya - there is no existence of a being. Here, the word 'Asti' in Natthi-Na'asti is a Tingt Pratiroopka Nipat, which should be understood in the plural. This means that there is no Upapat (birth) or transition of a being from one Bhav (existence) to another, i.e., they are not Aupapattik (born from another being). This is the meaning of the doctrine of the Tatchiva Tatcharirvadi, who present citations from their Agam or scriptures - This soul, which is the wealth of knowledge, is like a cognitive lump. It arises from these elements and is destroyed along with the destruction of those elements. After death, there is no remaining consciousness, knowledge, or awareness in it.

A doubt is raised - First, the view of the Panchbhutvadi theorist was presented. What is the special feature of the Tatchiva Tatcharirvadi doctrine compared to their doctrines?

In its solution, it is said - According to the Bhutvadi, the elements transformed into the form of the body perform all actions, and from them arises the soul. The Tatchiva Tatcharirvadi believes that from the elements transformed into the form of the body, the soul, which is called consciousness, arises or is obtained, and it is inseparable from them. This is the difference between the Tatchiva Tatcharirvadi and the Bhutvadi.

Natthi Punne Va Pave Va, Natthi Loe Ito Vare. Sarirass Vi Nase Nam, Vinaso Hoi Dehi No. || 12 ||

Shadow
Nasti Punyam Va Papam Va, Nasti Lok Itah Parah. Sarirasya Vinashena, Vinash Bhavat Dehinah. ||

Translation
There is neither the existence of merit nor of sin. There is no other world apart from the world in which we are. When the body is destroyed, the soul is also destroyed along with it.

-

Commentary
And to show that because of the absence of the Dharmin (soul), there is also the absence of Dharma (merit and demerit), the Sutrakar says - Punyam (merit) is characterized by the attainment of prosperity, and its opposite, Papam (demerit), both of these do not exist, because of the absence of the Atman (soul), which is the Dharmin, and because of its absence, there is no other world 'Parah' from this world, where there is the experience of merit and demerit. In this context, the Sutrakar states the reason - 'Sarirasya' (body) Vinashena (destruction) by the disintegration of the elements.

## The Sutra of the Sri Sutra Kritanga

"Destruction" is the absence of the embodied self, for there is no self apart from the body. When the body is destroyed, the self does not go to another world to experience merit or demerit. Therefore, for the Dharmi (the embodied self), the absence of the self means the absence of merit and demerit. There are many examples of this, such as: just as a water bubble is not separate from the water, so too the self is not separate from the five elements. Just as when the outer skin of a banana stem is peeled away, there is no inner essence, so too when the aggregate of elements disintegrates, there is no inner essence called the self. Just as a rotating piece of straw creates the illusion of a wheel, so too the aggregate of elements, with its specific activities, creates the illusion of a living being. Just as in a dream, we experience external forms through our own consciousness, so too the consciousness of the self arises from the aggregate of elements. Just as in a mirror, due to its clarity, an object outside is reflected and appears to be inside, but is not actually there, and just as in summer, the heat of the sun causes mirages to appear as water, so too Gandharva cities and other such things appear to be real, but are not. Similarly, the self, being separate from the aggregate of elements, creates the illusion of being real when the body undergoes transformation. Some Sutras explain these examples in detail, but we have not included them in this commentary due to their absence in the ancient commentaries.

If there is no self separate from the elements, and there is no merit or demerit, then how can the diversity of the world be explained? For example, some are rich, some are poor, some are beautiful, some are ugly, some are happy, some are unhappy, some are healthy, some are sick, etc. What is the basis for this diversity?

It is said that this diversity arises from the nature of things. For example, a piece of sandalwood, when rubbed, produces a fragrant smell and experiences the pleasure of incense, while a piece of stone is used for washing feet. There is no inherent merit or demerit in these two pieces of stone, but they experience different states due to their nature. Similarly, the diversity of the world arises from the nature of things. As it is said: "The sharpness of a thorn, the beauty of a peacock, and the colors of a copper-colored head are all due to their nature." This is the view of the "Jiva-Tattva-Sharir-Vadi" (those who believe in the self and its body).

## Self-Time Statement of Authority

No substance is available. Just as a spark, when rotated, appears to be a circle of light, but in reality it is not so, similarly, the community of elements, being associated with a specific action, creates the illusion of a living being or soul, but in reality there is nothing like that. Just as in a dream, even though external objects do not exist, their experience is felt, similarly, in the absence of the soul, knowledge about it arises in the community of elements, such a glimpse appears. A mirror is very clean. When reflected in it, external objects also seem as if they are inside the mirror, but in reality it is not so - it is not inside the mirror. Just as in the summer season, the rays of the sun, pulsating from the heat of the earth, produce watery knowledge, appearing as water. Gandharva Nagar etc. are as they are in their own form, they appear different from that. Similarly, the soul, even though it is not separate from the five elements in the form of the body, creates the illusion of being separate.

Many commentators analyze and discuss certain sutras that are proponents of these illustrations, but we have not seen those sutras in the old copies of the sutras - in the ancient commentaries. Therefore, they are not mentioned here. To tell

A doubt arises that if there is no independent substance called soul, apart from or in addition to the five elements, then the merits and demerits done by it cannot be done either. Then how can this world, which has so much diversity, happen? As a result of whom do these diverse situations appear? In this world, someone is powerful, someone is humble, someone is fortunate, someone is unfortunate, someone is prosperous, someone is suffering, someone is beautiful, someone is ugly, someone is diseased, someone is healthy without disease. Why do these diversities in the world happen?

In resolving this doubt, it is said from the side of the Tatchiva Tatcharirvadis that whatever happens, happens by nature, its cause is nature. For example, somewhere a stone block is given the form of a deity, kumkum, agar, sandalwood etc. are applied on it. They are wiped off, incense etc. fragrant substances are offered. She gets the opportunity to get the fragrance etc. of these. In other words, it can be said that she experiences it. There is another stone block on which people wash their feet etc. Such a low-grade work is used in which. No merits and demerits are associated with both the stone blocks, due to the rise of which they are getting such states. Therefore, it is proved that the cause of the diversity of the world is nature itself. It has been said that the sharpness in the thorn - the peculiarity in the peacock form, the variegated colorfulness, the peculiar color in the rooster - the cause of all this is nature itself. Here the principle of Tatchiva Tatcharirvadis has been explained.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Verse:**

"Even though it appears to be doing, or causing to be done, it does not do anything at all. Thus, the Self is an Akara (non-doer), and this is what the Sankhyas proclaim."

**Translation:**

The Self does not engage in any action on its own, nor does it cause any action to be done by another. It exists without doing anything. In other words, it is an Akara - not the doer of any action.

**Commentary:**

Here, the author, with the intention of explaining the Akara (non-doer) doctrine, says: "The word 'Kurvan' (doing) refers to an independent doer. But the Self, being formless, eternal, and all-pervading, cannot be a doer. For the same reason, the Self cannot be a causer either. The first 'cha' (and) negates the Self's past and future actions, while the second 'cha' is a connective. Therefore, the Self does not engage in any action on its own, nor does it cause any action to be done by another. Although it appears to perform actions like eating and drinking, due to the 'Mudra-Pratibimbo-dayana' (reflection in a mirror) and 'Japasphatika' (crystal) analogies, it is not actually the doer of any action. This is shown by the phrase 'Savvam Kuvvan Na Vijjai' (It does not do anything at all). The word 'Sarvam' refers to all actions, including pulsation, movement, and obtaining things from different places. The Self does not do any of these because it is all-pervading, formless, and inactive like space. This is also stated in the verse: 'Akara, Nirguna, Bhokta, Atma-Sankhya-Nidarsane' (The Self is a non-doer, attributeless, and enjoyer, as explained by the Sankhya philosophy). The word 'Evam' (thus) indicates that the Self is an Akara in this way. The word 'Te' (they) refers to the Sankhyas, and the word 'Tu' (but) emphasizes their distinct view. The Sankhyas, being 'Pragalbhitah' (proclaimers), repeatedly state their view, as in the statement: 'Prakriti does, Purusha enjoys, and the Purusha, through the intellect, understands the meaning of the object.' This is the Akara doctrine of the Sankhyas."

**Mudra-Pratibimbo-dayana:**

If an image is reflected in a mirror, it appears to be present there, even though it does not make any effort to be there. Similarly, the Self does not make any effort to manifest its state, nor does it perform any action, but it appears to be doing so, like the reflection in a mirror. This is called the 'Mudra-Pratibimbo-dayana' analogy.

**Japasphatika:**

The flower of the 'Japas' plant, which is red, when placed near a crystal, makes the crystal appear red. In reality, the crystal is not red, it remains white, but due to the reflection of the red flower, it appears red. This example illustrates that, according to the Sankhya philosophy, although the Self is devoid of the capacity to enjoy, it does not experience the fruits of actions. The enjoyment is experienced by the intellect, and due to its association with the intellect, it appears to be experienced by the Self. This is why the Self is considered the enjoyer. This is the meaning of the 'Japasphatika' analogy.

Page #57:
---------------------------
The statement of self-time authority is not there. Therefore, the Agamkaras say in the words "Savvam kuvvam na vijjai" that the soul moves from one place to another, etc., and performs actions that are pulsating and dynamic. When the soul is considered all-pervasive and without form, its state becomes like that of space. Just as space is inactive and devoid of action, so too is it devoid of action. It has been said in the Sankhya philosophy that the soul is inactive, devoid of agency, devoid of the qualities of sattva, rajas, and tamas, and devoid of the enjoyment of the fruits of actions. In other words, it is not the doer of any action, it is devoid of qualities, and it is devoid of the enjoyment of the fruits of actions. Thus, the inactivity of the soul is proved.

In this verse, the word "tu" is used to indicate the difference between the previously mentioned proponents of the theory and the Sankhya theorists. As mentioned earlier, those who believe in the Sankhya philosophy dare to assert that the soul is devoid of agency, and they repeatedly assert that nature is the only active principle. The soul-purusha is the enjoyer of the fruits of that action. The intellect understands the meaning, and the soul experiences it. This is the view of the inactive theorists.

"Je te u vaino evam, loe tesin kao sia? Tamao te tamm janti manda aaramhnissia." ||14||
Shadow - "Ye te tu vadin evam, lokas tesam kutah syat?
Tamasaste tamo yanti, manda aaramhnisritah."
Translation - "Those who argue that the soul is inactive and devoid of action, according to their theory, if their theory is accepted, how can the existence of this world, which is full of four movements, be proved? Its existence cannot be proved by such a theory. Those who expound such a theory are full of ignorance. They are attached to the beginnings of violence, etc. As a result, they move from one darkness to another, from one ignorance to another, and they acquire more and more ignorance."

Commentary - "Now, wishing to refute the view of those who believe that the body is the doer, he says - "Those who believe that the soul is not different from the body, having accepted the soul as different from the elements, as stated earlier, are refuted. What they have said - "Just as the soul is not different from the body," is not correct, because there is evidence to support it. And this is it - this body is made by a doer, because it has a definite form from the beginning. Here, whatever has a definite form from the beginning is seen to be made by a doer, such as a pot. And whatever is not made by a doer does not have a definite form from the beginning, such as space. Because the pervasiveness of the one who has a definite form from the beginning is the pervasiveness of the doer. The disappearance of the pervader means the disappearance of the pervaded. This should be applied everywhere. Similarly, the senses are made by a doer, because they are instruments. Here, whatever is an instrument is seen to be made by a doer, such as a stick, etc. The instrument cannot exist without a doer, just as space cannot exist. The soul is the doer of the senses, and it is different from them. Similarly, this group of objects of the senses is made by a doer, because there is the existence of the giver and the receiver. Here, wherever there is the existence of the giver and the receiver, there is seen a giver-receiver, such as...

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

This is different from the iron, which is different from the body and the bundle of sense organs. The one who is the receiver of the objects through the sense organs and instruments, he is the different self. Similarly, this body, which is the enjoyer, is the object of enjoyment, like rice and so on. Here, the self would be like the potter and others, because of the perception of their form, impermanence, and unity. Therefore, the objection based on the opposite means of proving the special nature of the self is not to be considered. The self of the transmigrating being is somehow considered to have form and so on, due to its association with karma and other attachments. Similarly, what is said, "There are no beings who are born spontaneously," is also not correct. Because, the desire of the newborn child for the breast is preceded by another desire, because it is a desire, like the desire of a young boy. Similarly, the knowledge of the child is preceded by another knowledge, because it is knowledge, like the knowledge of a young boy. Because, even the newborn child, until he understands that this is the breast, does not offer his mouth to the breast. Therefore, there is a trace of knowledge in the child, and it is preceded by another knowledge. And that other knowledge is the knowledge of the previous life. Therefore, there are beings who are born spontaneously. Similarly, what is said, "These beings arise from the mass of knowledge and perish with them," also has this meaning: "The mass of knowledge" is the self, the mass of knowledge. "Arising from the beings," means that due to the previous karma, the self experiences the fruits of its karma through the aggregate of beings, which has taken the form of a particular body. And upon the destruction of that, the self also perishes with it, and is reborn in another form. It does not perish with them. Similarly, what is said, "Due to the absence of the self, there is no absence of its qualities, virtue and vice," is also appropriate. Because, the self is established by the following chain of reasoning. And with its establishment, the establishment of its qualities, virtue and vice, is also to be understood. This is also seen in the diversity of the world. The example of the fruit fragment, which is based on nature, is also explained as such due to the karma of the enjoyer. Therefore, the existence of virtue and vice is inevitable. The many examples like the banana tree, which are presented to prove the absence of the self, also only prove the talkativeness of the person, because the self, which is different from the beings, the one who goes to the other world, the essential one, is established by the above mentioned method. The rest of the Sutra is explained now. Thus, "Their" - the ones who say that the self is non-existent, different from the beings - "world" - the four-fold transmigrating world, which is characterized by the movement from one existence to another, which is established earlier, which is characterized by the diversity of the world, like the movement of the good, the bad, the beautiful, the ugly, the lord, the poor, and so on - "from where does it arise?" - how can it be explained? - because of the non-acceptance of the self, it is not possible in any way. "And they" - the non-believers, who do not accept the existence of the soul who goes to the other world, and who accept the absence of virtue and vice, go to another greater darkness, which is in the form of ignorance, from the darkness which is in the form of the doer, because of the ignorance which is in the form of the doer. Or, they go to a greater darkness, which is in the form of the covering of knowledge, because of the darkness which is in the form of the covering of knowledge. Or, they go to a greater darkness, which is in the form of the covering of knowledge, because of the darkness which is in the form of the covering of knowledge.

"It is said that one should be happy with virtue and have the right to speak at the right time. But this is not seen or desired. And since the self is all-pervasive and eternal, there would be no five types of destinies - hell, animal, human, celestial, and liberation. Therefore, the arguments of the Sankhyas regarding the wearing of saffron robes, shaving the head and beard, carrying a staff, begging for food, and following the teachings of the five nights are all meaningless. Similarly, the statement:

"He who knows the twenty-five principles,
Is devoted to the refuge wherever he may be,
Whether he has matted hair, a shaved head, or a tuft of hair,
He is liberated, there is no doubt. ||1||"

and so on, is also meaningless. There would be no coming and going in the realms of gods, humans, etc., because the self is all-pervasive and eternal. Also, due to the eternal nature of the self, there would be no forgetting, remembering of past lives, etc. And since the self is the first cause, the action of eating, which is based on the principle "Nature acts, the self enjoys," is also not possible, because the self is also an agent. If it is said that "enjoyment is through the principle of the reflection of the seal," then this is refuted by the constant friends, because it is merely a matter of words, and the reflection of the seal is also a specific action. And since the self is eternal and unchanging, there is no reflection of the seal, and therefore this is all meaningless. ||34||

"But even if the self is active through the mere action of eating and the mere reflection of the seal, we do not consider it to be active merely through these. What then? It is active through all actions." This doubt is addressed by the author:

"It is not that the absence of a tree is the cause of the absence of fruit. Nor is it that whenever there is fruit, there is a tree, and that there is something else besides the tree. Similarly, even though the self may be inactive in a state of sleep, etc., it does not deserve to be called inactive. And the absence of fruit is not a sufficient reason for the absence of a tree, because even a tree with little fruit is still considered a tree. Similarly, even though the self may have little action, it is still an agent. Perhaps you may think that a self with little action is inactive, just as a person with one karshapan is not considered wealthy. Similarly, the self is inactive because it has little action. This is also not correct, because this analogy is understood in relation to a specific person, or in relation to all people? If it is the former, then it is a case of proving the already proven, because he is poor compared to someone with thousands of karshapanas. If it is the latter, then it is not valid, because even one karshapan is considered wealth compared to others who are beggars. Similarly, if the self is considered inactive in relation to a person with specific qualities, there is no harm. But in relation to the general, it is an agent. Therefore, this is not a valid argument. Similarly, the two reasons, namely, the absence of fruit and the absence of fruit at a specific time, are not sufficient reasons for the absence of a tree. And so on. Similarly, the reasons of the absence of milk and the presence of little milk do not prove the absence of a cow. This is similar to the analogy of the dart, which is not relevant to the task at hand. ||35||14||

Commentary: Now, in order to refute the views of those who believe that the self is inseparable from the body and those who believe that the self is inactive, the author of the scripture explains:

The view of those who believe that the self is inseparable from the body is refuted here. They have stated that the self is not separate from the body, but this is not consistent. This statement is not consistent because the self is separate from the body. There is evidence to prove this fact. It is this: This body has a maker, it is made by someone, because it is equipped with a beginning and an end, and it has a definite form. In this world, all objects that have a beginning and an end and have definite forms and shapes have a maker, as can be seen. That is, they are made by someone. A pot is an example. There is no maker visible for an object that does not have a maker, which is (31)
"

---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** is not created by anyone, it is not beginningless and does not have a definite shape, like the sky. Therefore, whatever substance is beginningless and has a definite shape, it has a doer - it is done by someone, this is the pervasiveness - the principle of pervasiveness. Where there is no pervasiveness - where there is no pervader, there is also no pervaded - there is also no pervaded. Therefore, if the body is not created by anyone, then it cannot be beginningless and have a definite shape. This should be connected everywhere and also - there is definitely a controller of the senses, because the senses are in the form of instruments or means. In this world, whatever instruments or means there are, there is definitely a controller of them. The potter's stick used to rotate the wheel is an example of this. The stick is the means, the potter is not its controller, it cannot be the instrument or means. The sky is an example of this. The sky has no controller, therefore the sky is not an instrument or means. The soul is the controller of the senses. It is separate from those senses. There must be a receiver of those senses and objects, because there is a relationship between the receiver and the received - the receiver and the received. Wherever there is a receiver and received, there must be some substance that receives. For example, a piece of iron and a hammer can be taken. The hammer can be considered as the sense organ and the piece of iron as the object. The blacksmith is their controller. This example can be connected with the sense, object and their receiver, the soul.
Therefore, the soul is separate from the senses, which are the instruments or means by which the objects are received. That is, there must be an enjoyer of this body, because just as rice etc. are enjoyable, so is this body an enjoyable substance. In the previous example, the potter is a material, impermanent and composite substance. Seeing this, why should the soul not be material, impermanent and composite? It is not right to doubt this, because worldly souls are bound with karma, so they are considered to be material etc. to some extent.
It is also wrong to say that beings do not go to the next world, do not take rebirth, because a child born on the same day shows a desire and effort to drink milk from its mother's breasts. This knowledge or tendency is due to some previous knowledge, because every desire that arises - knowledge, there are other desires and knowledge before it. The child's knowledge is an example of this. A child born on the same day does not put its mouth to the breast until it knows, until it is certain that this is the breast, which is unfamiliar to it. This proves that the child has some knowledge. That partial knowledge is due to other knowledge, that is, there was other knowledge before it. That other knowledge is the knowledge of the other world. It is according to the knowledge or experience gained in the other world. This proves that the being is transmigratory, goes to the next world, takes birth in the other world.

## Self-Time Statement of Authority

The statement made by the proponents of the "Tajjiva Tatcharirvadi" theory, that the soul is a "Vigyanghana" - a highly scientific entity, and a "Vigyanpinda" - a scientific body, which arises from the five elements and is destroyed when they are destroyed, is not correct. The scriptural verse they cite does not mean that. The meaning of that verse is that the "Vigyanghana" and "Vigyanpinda" soul, according to the karmas accumulated in the previous birth, takes on a body form through the five elements, experiences the fruits of its karmas, and when those elements are destroyed, it is destroyed from that form and then is born again in another body - another birth. The verse does not mean that the soul is destroyed along with those elements.

It is also not logical to say that since the existence of the soul in its "Dharmi" form is not proven, the existence of "Dharma" - virtue and vice - is also not proven. If there is no "Dharmi" soul, then where would "Dharma" - virtue and vice - come from? This statement is not logical. The arguments presented earlier prove the existence of the soul in its "Dharmi" form. When the existence of the soul in its "Dharmi" form is established, then "Dharma" - virtue and vice, which are its attributes, are also established. This is how it should be understood. Also, the diversity, uniqueness, and variety that we see in this world also proves the existence of virtue and vice.

The example of the stone blocks given by the "Tajjiva Tatcharirvadi" proponents to prove the diversity of the world, taking the meaning of "nature," is also not appropriate. This is because the effect of the karmas of the owners or authorities who experience those stone blocks is the reason for that diversity. According to them, the existence of virtue and vice cannot be erased. The examples of the banana stem, etc., given to prove the non-existence or absence of the soul are also mere statements. Because the arguments presented earlier prove the existence of the soul - which is the essence - separate from the elements that go to the afterlife. Therefore, it is not necessary to go into further detail in this regard.

While explaining the remaining sutra, it is said that this world is filled with beings of four paths. They go from one birth to another. Some are fortunate, some are unfortunate, some are beautiful, some are ugly, some are wealthy, and some are poor, etc. They are born in different forms. According to the theory of the "Tajjiva Tatcharirvadi" proponents, who do not believe in the existence of a separate entity called the soul, distinct from the elements, how can this happen? By what logic does this happen? They do not believe in the existence of the soul, so according to their theory, the diversity and variety of the world cannot happen. Therefore, they are atheists - they do not believe in the afterlife, etc. They do not accept the existence of a soul that goes to the afterlife. Therefore, they do not believe in virtue and vice. Therefore, they do whatever comes to their mind. They come out of one ignorance-based darkness and go into another ignorance-based darkness. This means that they accumulate greater and greater darkness in the form of karmas, etc., which cover the knowledge that is veiled by ignorance. Or, what is similar to darkness is called "Tam" here. This word is used for the place of hell, etc., where beings are subjected to severe suffering, which causes the "Sadbhaav" - the wisdom of the hell-dwellers - to be destroyed. They come out of that darkness - from those hellish places - and go into even greater darkness - into the hells. From there, they go to the seventh hell, which contains the specific hells of Raurava, Maharaurava, Kala, Maha Kala, and Apratisthan.

---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**The question arises - why do they go to hell? The answer is that they are dull-witted, devoid of knowledge, rooted in ignorance, and devoid of consciousness. They are fools. Even though they are proven by the methods of the soul, they do not accept it due to their attachment and false beliefs. They are definitely engaged in the actions that wise men have condemned as animal oppression and animal violence. Believing that there is no such thing as virtue and vice, they remain completely detached from the afterlife, not caring about it. They are engaged in the initial mixed violence and other initial and subsequent actions. The author, refuting the theory of the body-worshippers, has also presented the 'Panchana' etc. verses. That verse, as before, applies here as well. Now, relying on the theory of the non-doer, this verse is reinterpreted.**

**I**

**These non-doers consider abstractness, formlessness, eternity, indestructibility, and omnipresence as the qualities of the soul. Accordingly, they call the soul eternal, formless, and omnipresent. They consider it inactive. If their opinion is considered correct, and the soul is truly inactive, then how is this world possible with old age, death, sorrow, grief, crying, beating, joy, and the states of hell, animal, human, and god? How can these things be achieved through inactivity? If the soul is considered to be without birth and destruction, stable, and existing with one nature, then the aforementioned state of the world cannot be formed in any way. Therefore, those men who believe in non-doing, emerging from ignorance that hinders the acceptance of things that are seen and desired, attain a lower level of ignorance, a place of torment - hell, a place of great suffering.**

**Why does this happen? It is said that they are dull and inert, engaged in harming and hurting beings. Now, the author refutes the theory of the non-doers.**

**Who knows the action that has not been done? That is, if there is no doer, then there cannot be any action done by him. How can one experience what has not been done? If the soul is considered inactive, devoid of action, then favorable and unfavorable, painful and pleasurable, happiness and sorrow do not occur. If one experiences happiness and sorrow even without doing any action, then there are faults in the form of 'Akrtaagam' and 'Kritnash'. 'Akrtaagam' means experiencing the fruits of actions that have not been done. This can be considered impossible. And not experiencing the fruits of actions that have been done is called the fault of 'Kritnash'. It is also an impossible situation that an action has been done but its fruits are not experienced.**

**T**

**Keeping in mind the omnipresent aspect of the soul, it is said that if that is the case, then the sinful actions done by one being should be experienced by all beings, they should be unhappy, and all beings should be happy due to the virtuous actions performed by one. But this is not visible, nor is it desirable. If the soul is omnipresent, it is eternal, then the five states of hell, animal, human, god, and liberation cannot be achieved. Then, the wearing of saffron robes by the followers of the Sankhya philosophy, the shaving of the head, the carrying of a staff, the sustenance by food received in alms, and the observance of Yama - non-violence, truth, non-stealing, celibacy, and non-possession, according to the teachings of their scripture called Pancharatra, would be meaningless. Along with this, it is said that the twenty-five elements - nature, Mahat, ego, five subtle elements, ten senses, one**

Page #63:
---------------------------
The statement that the soul, which knows the mind, the five great elements, and the one man-soul, is liberated, regardless of whether it resides in an ashram, wears matted hair, or has a topknot, is meaningless and pointless.

By considering the soul as pervasive and eternal, it is not possible for it to be born in a divine or human womb, to leave it, and to be reborn in another womb. Since the soul is eternal, it does not experience any kind of forgetfulness or delusion. All things remain in its memory as they are. Therefore, actions like remembering one's birth and caste do not arise.

The use of "tathā" and other such words here implies that nature is the doer. The doership of all actions in the world lies with nature. The soul is the enjoyer of its fruits. In Samkhya, the soul is called Purusha. Therefore, the implication here is that the soul enjoys the fruits of actions performed by nature. This is not proven because enjoyment is also an action. In Samkhya, the soul is considered inactive or inert.

If it is said that the soul enjoys the fruits of actions performed by nature through the analogy of the reflection of a seal, i.e., just as a seal and an image remain outside but are reflected in a mirror and appear to be in the mirror, similarly, although the action of enjoyment does not occur in the soul, it appears to be in the soul like the image reflected in a mirror, this statement is merely a play of words and devoid of logic. Only those who are not aware of reality will accept this.

Is it not also worth considering that the appearance of a reflection in a mirror is also a kind of action? When the soul is eternal, unchanging, and without modification, how can this action occur in it? Just as the appearance of an image in a mirror does not occur in the soul, such an action never occurs.

If you say that the action of enjoyment and the appearance of a reflection occur in the soul, then we can consider the soul to be active in this regard. However, we cannot consider it to be capable of performing all actions simply because of this action. The soul can be considered active if it performs all actions.

The author, anticipating such a doubt, writes:

The absence of fruit does not prove the absence of a tree, because if a tree bears fruit, it is called a tree, and if it does not bear fruit, it is not considered a tree. Similarly, although the soul is inactive and without action in certain bodily states, such as sleep, it cannot be called actionless simply because of this. Trees that bear little fruit are not evidence of the absence of a tree, i.e., it is not necessary to have abundant fruit to be called a tree. Jackfruit trees, etc., bear very little fruit, but they are still called trees. Similarly, if the soul is slightly active, it is still called active.

If you state your opinion as follows: "That which has little action is actionless, just as someone who has only one penny is not called wealthy, similarly, the soul is not called active because of its slight activity, it is inactive," this is not inappropriate or unsuitable.

The question is, did you give this analogy with respect to a particular individual or with respect to all individuals? If you gave it with respect to someone who...

Page #64:
---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

This analogy is given with respect to a man who has thousands of coins. That man who has only one coin proves the universally accepted meaning because, compared to the man who has thousands of coins, the man who has only one coin is undoubtedly poor. If you call the man who has one coin poor with respect to the men who have thousands of coins, then it is not correct because, compared to the men who do not have even one coin, who wear worn-out clothes, the man who has one coin is also wealthy. If you call the soul inactive or actionless with respect to the action of a specific powerful man, then there is no harm or obstacle, but if you call the soul inactive with respect to the general public, then it is not appropriate because, with respect to the general public, the soul is active and functioning. Now, to say more on this subject would be too irrelevant, so it is not necessary to say it.

Therefore, according to the previous discussion, even in the case of a tree that is not certain to bear fruit and does not bear fruit definitely - which does not bear fruit at the right time, bears fruit before or after - there is no lack of treehood. It is a tree. The tree is not different from the tree, etc. This analogy should be nurtured here - understood as it is. Similarly, the fact that a cow does not give milk at all or that a cow gives a small amount of milk does not prove the absence of cowhood, i.e., it cannot be assumed that they are not cows. They are cows. This example should be used to nurture the truth contained therein. The truth should be established by comparison.

**Santi**

**Five great elements, these are declared here.**
**The sixth is the soul, they say, the soul and the world are eternal.**

**Translation:** Many proponents - theorists - declare that in this world there are five great elements, earth, etc. The sixth is the soul. They further declare that the soul and the world are eternal.

**Commentary:** To present the view of the soul-sixth-ists as the opposing view, the author says, "Santi" - they exist, "five great elements" - earth, etc., "here" - in this world, "of these" - the Vedic proponents, the Samkhya, and the Shaiva authorities - this has been declared or the elements have been declared. These proponents say this - they have declared this, as "the soul is the sixth" - those for whom the soul is the sixth, those are the soul-sixth elements that exist. And these soul-sixth elements, just as they are impermanent for other proponents, so also for these, he shows. The soul, "and the world" - in the form of earth, etc., "eternal" - imperishable. There, the soul's pervasiveness and formlessness, like that of space, are its eternality, and the earth, etc., are imperishable due to their non-decay in that form.

Page #65:
---------------------------
The **Svayam-Vaktvyata-Adhikarah** state that there are five great elements in this world, namely earth, water, fire, air, and space. They also state that in addition to these five elements, there is a sixth element, the soul. While other schools of thought consider these elements to be impermanent, they do not. To demonstrate this, they say that the world, which is born from these five elements, and the soul are eternal and do not perish. The soul, like space, is all-pervasive and formless, and it is eternal. The five elements, due to their inherent nature, are indestructible and cannot be destroyed.

**"Dah-o na vinassan-ti, no ya uparajjae asan.
Savve-a-vi savva-ha bhaava niyattimaav-ama-gaya."** (16)

**"Chhaya - Dvidha-api na vinashyati, nacho-tpad-yate-asan.
Sarve-api sarvatha bhaava niyati-bhaava-ma-gata."**

**Translation:** The five elements, including the soul, which were mentioned earlier, do not perish either with or without a cause. That which does not exist cannot be created. In other words, only that which exists can be created. All things are imbued with the nature of **niyati** (eternity) and are therefore eternal.

**Commentary:** To further emphasize the concept of eternity, the text states: "**Te**" (referring to the soul and the five elements) do not perish due to either the presence or absence of a cause. Just as the **Boddh-as** (enlightened beings) are inherently imperishable, so too are these elements. As it is said:

**"Jaati-reva-hi bhaava-naam, vinaashe hetu-rishyate.
Yo jaata-shcha na cha dhvasto, nas-yet pas-chaat-sa kena cha?"** (1)

Just as the **Vaisheshikas** believe that destruction occurs due to the presence of a cause, such as the proximity of a hammer and a pot, so too, the world and the soul are not destroyed by either cause or no cause. Alternatively, the text could be interpreted as saying that the soul, being two-fold in nature (consciousness and non-consciousness), does not perish due to its inherent nature. Similarly, earth, fire, air, and space are eternal because they do not lose their inherent nature. As it is said:

**"Na kadaachid-ani-drish-am jagad-i"** (Never has this world been non-existent).

The soul is also eternal because it is not created. As it is said:

**"Naenam chhindatti shastraani, naenam dahati paavaka.
Na chaenam kledayanty-a-po, na sho-shayati-ma-aruta."** (1)

**"A-ch-ched-yo-ayam a-bhed-yo-ayam a-vi-kaaryo-ayam u-ch-yate.
Nitya sarva-gata sthaan-ur a-chalo-ayam sana-tana."** (2)

Therefore, nothing can be created from non-existence, because everything exists eternally. Since there is no action of a cause in non-existence, the principle of **sat-kaarya-vaad** (the effect is always pre-existent in the cause) holds true. If something could be created from non-existence, then even things like the horn of a god could be created. As it is said:

**"Asad-karanaad-upa-daana grahanaat sarva-sam-bhaava-abhaavaat.
Shakt-asya shakya-karanaat, kaarana-bhaava-cha sat-kaarya."** (1)

Similarly, a pot exists in the clay, because the potter takes the clay to make the pot. If something could be created from non-existence, then it would come from anywhere and everywhere. There would be no need for the potter to take the clay. Therefore, the effect is always created from a pre-existent cause. Thus, all things, including the five elements and the soul, are imbued with the nature of **niyati** (eternity). They do not become non-existent and then become existent. They are simply manifestations and disappearances. As it is said:

**"Na-sato jaayate bhaavo, na-abhaavo jaayate sata."** (Nothing comes from non-existence, and non-existence does not come from existence).

The text continues with the phrase **"Ko ve-e-i"** (Who is this?), which refers to the previous verse. The acceptance of the eternity of all things leads to the concept of **krit-ritva-parinaama** (the transformation of the agent).

Page #66:
---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra:

**The Sutra states:** "It is not so, for if the self is not the doer, then there is no binding of karma, and without that, who experiences pleasure, pain, etc.? This means that there would be no destruction of what is done. Similarly, if there is no origination of what is not, then the fivefold path, which is characterized by the birth of a new existence after the abandonment of the previous existence, would be false. And from this, the absence of liberation would make the performance of rituals like initiation meaningless. Also, if the self is unchanging, unoriginated, and eternally stable, then its movement through the realms of gods and humans, as well as the remembrance of its birth, would not occur. And what is said, 'It is born as a god,' is also false, because if it is eternally a god, how can it be born? If it is born, then it is not eternally a god. Thus, it is said:

"**The qualities and designations of karma do not exist before birth, because what is not is to be known as non-existent, from the activity of the doer.**" (1)

Therefore, it is to be understood that all things are eternal in some way, and that the theory of the existence of only what is real is true. Thus, it is said:

"**In all beings, there is constant change from moment to moment, and there is no difference. This is true because of the arrangement of form, species, and birth.**" (1)

And also:

"**There is no unity with difference, nor is difference the function of unity. The difference of clay is the function of the contact of two different types of clay, and the pot is a different species.**" (2)

**Commentary:**

The Agamakaras, while discussing the eternity of the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, and space) and the sixth entity (the soul), say that these six entities are never destroyed. Destruction is of two types: without cause and with cause. These entities are not destroyed by either of these types. According to the Buddhists, things are destroyed spontaneously without any cause. They say that the birth or origination of things is considered the cause of their destruction. What is not destroyed immediately after its origination cannot be destroyed by any cause later. Those who believe in the Vaisheshika philosophy say that the destruction of things caused by a stick, a staff, or a club, due to their striking or hitting, is called destruction with cause, because these causes remain present in the destruction. This destruction is called with cause or caused by a reason because the stick, etc., have been used in the destruction. The followers of the Atmashathvada believe that neither the soul nor the world is destroyed by either of these types of destruction, with or without cause. This is the opinion of the Atmashathvada. Or, the soul, which is characterized by consciousness, and the five elements, which are characterized by non-consciousness, never deviate from their nature, never get destroyed, because earth, water, fire, air, and space never abandon their nature, they remain immersed in their own nature. Therefore, they are eternal, and this world, as it is, never becomes different, therefore it is eternal. The soul is also eternal because it is not created or made by anyone. The Gita says in this regard: The soul cannot be cut by weapons, it cannot be burned by fire, water cannot wet it, wind cannot dry it. The soul is indestructible, it cannot be pierced, it is impenetrable, it is unchanging, it is eternal, it is all-pervading, it is stable, it is unmoving, it is ancient.

While discussing the theory of the existence of only what is real, it is said that the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, and space) and the sixth entity (the soul) are eternal. They always exist. Therefore, what is not real, what does not exist, never originates. All things are always real and existing. If they were not real, then the actions of the doer, the object of action, and the instrument of action would not be possible in them. This leads to the theory of the existence of only what is real.

Page #67:
---------------------------
The doctrine of self-existence is proven. If non-existent things could be produced, then things like the horns of a donkey or the poison of a snake could also be produced. Therefore, it is said:

(That which is not present in a place or in something cannot be produced from it. When any substance is produced, there is a need for the acceptance of the material cause, without which it cannot exist. For example, if a pot is produced, it needs the material cause in the form of clay. The acceptance of the material cause is necessary for the accomplishment of the work. Without it, the accomplishment of the work is not possible. If the non-existent is produced, then what is the need to accept the material cause? Good things can come out of any object. This is not possible - what is good in it, comes out of it. What can be done from it, can be done from it, what cannot be done from it, cannot be produced from it. Only that which is possible is produced. Every work has its own cause. The work is produced from the cause. From all these expectations, the work is good. For example, the pot is present in the lump of clay because the pot comes into existence only by accepting the lump of clay. If the non-existent is produced, then it can be produced from anywhere, then it is not necessary to accept the lump of clay for it. Therefore, the cause in which the good is present - the work already has its own existence, from it its production is certain. In this way, all the objects of feeling - earth etc. five elements - the sixth soul, all these have eternal existence. These do not become transformed into the form of non-existence and then produced in the form of existence, it is only the form of non-appearance-disappearance, production and destruction. (In the Gita) it is said:

Non-existence does not produce existence, and existence does not produce non-existence. The appointed person has answered this. In it, the aforementioned verse "ko veei" etc. has been discussed - if all substances are accepted as eternal - accepted or attached - they are considered eternal, then the result or principle of action does not occur. If the soul does not have the result of action, then it cannot have karma-bondage, and if there is no karma-bondage, then one cannot experience happiness or sorrow. In such a situation, the fault called "kritnash" arises. That is, the principle that a being has to experience the fruits of its own actions is destroyed. If the production or origin of the non-existent is not accepted, then the five types of motion of the soul, which are said to be born in another existence after abandoning the previous existence, cannot happen. In such a situation, if there is no liberation, then the practice of initiation etc. as a way of accepting a restrained life becomes meaningless. If the soul is considered to be unchanging - stable in one form - without destruction, unproduced - free in nature, then it is not possible for it to be born in the form of a god, human etc. in the divine realm, human realm etc. Due to eternity, there is no forgetfulness, due to which the origin of knowledge like caste-memory is not possible. Therefore, considering the soul as eternally separate is inconsistent - untrue. What is said that only the good is produced - to say so is also untrue, inappropriate, if it exists completely in the form of good, then how can the situation of its production or origin arise? Production is of that which does not exist. If there is production or origin, it cannot be completely good. Therefore, it is said:

Until the substances are not produced, they cannot have qualities and names. For example, until the pot is produced, how can the work of bringing water by it happen? Its non-existence

---------------------------
The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra states that qualities cannot exist where the substance itself does not exist, and names like "pot" cannot be applied to them. 
Furthermore, the action of making a pot occurs when the pot does not exist. Once the pot is made, that action ceases. Therefore, it should be understood that actions are non-existent before their creation. 
All substances are eternal in some respects and impermanent in others. This is the principle of the existence and non-existence of actions. 
It is said:
1. All individuals, objects, or substances are constantly changing, but their difference or distinction is not perceived. They remain essentially the same in their nature. This is because substances undergo decay and growth. They decrease and increase, but their form and kind remain stable. 
The action is not completely inseparable from the cause. There is a perception of difference between cause and effect, but there is no complete separation. Because the cause is inherent in the effect. Therefore, the pot, which has a relationship of difference and non-difference with clay, is a substance of a different kind. This is the situation. 
Some ignorant people say that the five skandhas are momentary. They say that the soul is neither different nor non-different from the five elements. It is neither caused nor uncaused. 
Commentary: 
The author, refuting the Buddhist view, presents the argument against the doctrine of impermanence. He says, "Some Buddhists say that there are five skandhas: form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness. They say that there is no other skandha called the soul." 
Form skandha includes earth, water, fire, air, and space. Feeling skandha includes pleasure, pain, and neutral feeling. Perception skandha includes perception of form, taste, smell, sound, and touch. Mental formations skandha includes mental impressions. Consciousness skandha includes the faculty of consciousness. 
There is no other substance called the soul apart from these five skandhas. This is because there is no evidence to support the existence of a soul, and it cannot be inferred. There is no other valid means of knowledge besides perception and inference. Therefore, Buddhists, like children, understand the truth in a childish way. 
They say that these skandhas are momentary. A moment is the shortest possible duration of time. They are connected with a moment. They exist only for a moment. They say that a substance, when it arises, is either impermanent or permanent. If it is permanent, then it would be eternal and there would be no action. Therefore, the substance itself would not exist. 
Because whatever is the cause of action is truly real. And that which is eternal is always active. Does it act gradually or simultaneously? It cannot act gradually, because if it did, then it would have the nature of acting in another way at another time.

---------------------------
Is there a right to speak at the right time or not? If there is, how is it ordered? If it is dependent on cooperation, then does the cooperator do something extraordinary or not? If he does, is it by abandoning his previous nature or by abandoning it? If it is by abandoning it, then it is impermanent due to the attainment of an unformed state. Or, if it is by abandoning his previous nature, then there is no extraordinary thing, so is it dependent on cooperation? Or, even if he does nothing, he depends on something specific for his work, which is not right, because:

"If someone depends on another to do something,
What is the thing that does nothing, depends on anything?" ||1||

Or, at the time of doing an action for one purpose, he does not have the nature of doing an action for another purpose, and in that case, the loss of permanence is clear. Or, he is eternal and does an action for a purpose simultaneously, in which case, since he does all actions in the first moment, he becomes inactive in the second moment, and thus, there is impermanence. Or, because of his nature, he does the same action again and again in the second moments, which is not possible because of the absence of doing what was done. Moreover, even the things that are to be achieved in the second moments are obtained in the first moment, because of his nature. If he is not of that nature, then his impermanence is established. Thus, due to the absence of action for a purpose from the eternal one, due to the order and simultaneity, the eternal one is not produced from its causes. Or, the impermanent nature arises, and in that case, due to the absence of obstacles, the impermanence of all things, as we have said, is established. Thus, it is said:

"The nature itself is considered to be the cause of the destruction of things.
The one who has nature and is not destroyed, how will he be destroyed later by whom?" ||1||

Now, even if there is impermanence, when the cause of destruction is present, then there is destruction. Thus, even the things that are impermanent due to the absence of the cause of their own destruction are not momentary. This is also the statement of the teacher who is not to be disregarded. For example, what is done by a hammer, etc., which is the cause of destruction, to a pot, etc.? What is to be asked here? Absence is done. And here, the beloved of the gods, absence, is to be asked. Is this a denial of a statement or a denial of a consequence? If it is a denial of a statement, then the meaning is that absence is different from existence, it is another existence, a pot, a cloth, etc., that is absence. If there is no action of a hammer, etc., in another existence, then nothing is done to the pot by it. If it is a denial of a consequence, then the meaning is that it makes the cause of destruction absent. What is said? It does not make existence. Thus, only the denial of action is done. And the action of a pot, etc., is not done by a hammer, etc., because it is done by its own causes. Or, existence-absence is absence, it does that. But, due to its insignificance and formlessness, how can there be action of an agent and a cause there? Or, if there is action of an agent there, then the agents would act in a rhinoceros horn, etc., as well. Thus, due to the inactivity of the cause of destruction, the momentariness is established due to the absence of an obstacle to the arising of things that are made momentary by their own causes. The word "tu" indicates the difference from the previous statements. The same is shown in the latter half of the verse, "anno ananno". For, just as the Buddhists, like the Atma-Shashthavadins, the Samkhyas, etc., have accepted a self that is different from the elements, and just as the Charvakas have accepted a self that is different from the elements, called consciousness, so they have not said or accepted that the self is born from causes, is made of the body, is transformed into the elements, and is produced. Thus, they, the Buddhists, have not accepted that self as causeless, beginningless, and endless, and eternal. ||17||

Commentary: Now, the author of the scripture presents the Buddhist philosophy as the opposing view, and then describes the doctrine of non-fruitfulness as propounded by the author of the work.

Many theorists - those who believe in the Buddhist philosophy - propound the five aggregates. They say that in this world, there are five aggregates called form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness. There is no other or separate aggregate-substance called soul. Earth element and form, etc., are called the form aggregate. The experience of pleasure, the experience of pain, and the experience of neither pleasure nor pain are called the feeling aggregate. Form

The **Sri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states that **knowledge**, **science of taste**, and other such **sciences** are called **knowledge-skandha**. Words that are the **extractors**, **illuminators**, or **indicators** of substances are called **name-skandha**. **Sin**, **merit**, and other such **dharma-samudaya-samavaya-samskara** are called **skandha**. Apart from these, the substance called **soul** is not experienced directly. No **sign**, **mark**, or **characteristic** is found that is **invariably** and **perfectly** associated with the soul. Therefore, the soul cannot be known through **inference** either. Apart from **direct perception** and **inference**, there is no third **proof** that can establish the truth of the soul, which is **non-contradictory** and **true**. Therefore, just as ignorant children are devoid of knowledge of substances, they state that the five **skandha** are **momentary**. **Extremely restricted** or **subtle time** is called a **moment**. The connection or **yoga** with that **moment** is called **momentary**. The substance that is connected or associated with that **moment** is called **momentary**. That **moment** alone exists or persists. Buddhists present their doctrine in this way to prove it. They say in the language of questions: Is the substance that arises due to its causes **perishable** or **imperishable**? If it arises as **imperishable**, then the **meaningful actions** that are present in the substance can arise simultaneously and gradually. Therefore, due to the absence or non-existence of the **meaningful action** in its **extensive form**, the **substance** that is capable of being **pervaded** and **pervading** will also not exist. The **meaningful action** that is **capable** of acting on the substance or object is truly **real** and **eternal**. Its nature is not **perishable**. A question arises: Does that **eternal substance** engage in **meaningful action** simultaneously or gradually? If you say that it engages in action gradually, then it is not consistent because in the time when it is engaged in performing one action, the question arises whether it has the nature of performing another action or not. If you say that it has the nature of performing another action, then why does it not perform other actions simultaneously? Why does it perform them in order or gradually? If you say that the nature of that **philosophy** to perform other actions besides the **action being performed** exists in that time, but its **action** is connected with **cooperating causes**, therefore, it performs actions gradually, not simultaneously, depending on them, as they are available. This is also not appropriate. Tell me whether the **cooperating cause** produces something **extraordinary** in the object or not. If it produces something **extraordinary**, then does it arise by abandoning the previous nature of the object or without abandoning it? If it arises by abandoning the previous nature of the object, then the object becomes **impermanent** due to the absence of its **original state** or **nature**. It cannot be **eternal**. If it is said that the previous nature of the object is not abandoned, then there is an absence of any **extraordinary** or **distinctive feature** in it due to the **cooperating cause**. No **extraordinary** can be produced in it. When this is the case, then what is the need for the **cooperating cause**? If it is said that the **cooperating cause**, although it does nothing, is still needed for a specific task, then this is also unreasonable. It has been said:

## Self-Time Statement of Authority

I

It is expected, it is considered necessary, that one who does something for someone, who does a favor, should be expected, but why should one expect anything from someone who does nothing, who does no favor? Who will consider his need for what? If it is said that the substance, while performing one action, does not have the nature of performing any other action, therefore, while performing one action, it does not have the nature of performing any other action. That is, while performing one action, it does not perform any other action. This being the case, it is clear that there is a loss of permanence in them. They are not permanent. If it is said that it performs the meaning-action of the permanent word-pair simultaneously, then consider - if all the actions are done in the first moment, then in the second moment, the substance becomes inactive, non-doer, and impermanence arises. If it is said that the nature of that substance is such that it continues to perform the meaning-actions again and again in the second and subsequent moments, then this is inconsistent, illogical, because there is a lack of repetition of the done, that is, what has been done once cannot be done again. If it can do all the actions at once, then the substances that are to be in the second and subsequent moments also happen in the first moment. The reason for this is that the nature of the emergence of the substances that are to be produced in the second and subsequent moments is also in that first moment. If such a nature does not exist in the first moment, then it is impermanent, this is clearly proven. Thus, that substance can neither perform the meaning-action gradually nor is it capable of doing so all at once. The substance that is permanent cannot be produced from its causes. Thus, if it is proven that the impermanent nature itself produces substances, then all substances will be momentary, because only the impermanent, perishable, or momentary can be produced. This does not pose any obstacle or hindrance to the proof of our exposition. It has been said that the nature, the origin of the substances, is the cause of their destruction or impermanence. The substance that was produced and did not perish, that is, did not perish as soon as it was produced, will be destroyed by whom later - it will never be destroyed.

Further, it is doubted - if there is impermanence in substances, but when the cause of the destruction or destruction of a substance is present, then that substance is destroyed. Therefore, even if substances are destroyed in relation to their respective causes of destruction, the momentariness of substances that are impermanent is not proven - they do not last for a moment - such a situation does not arise.

In resolving this, it is said - this is what is said - the words of those who have not worshipped the Guru - who have not acquired knowledge in the presence of the Guru. What is the point of asking more in the present context? It is self-evident. It is said that absence is made - by breaking a pot with a pestle, etc., its absence is made - those who advocate this, the beloved of the gods - the ignorant or the fool should be asked - is the use of nay in the word absence here a paryudasa or a prasajjapratisedha? Think about it. If it is paryudasa, then the meaning will be to go from one state to another, or to be in another state by leaving one state, or according to this, the meaning of ghatabhava is to be the absence of pat, etc., different from ghat. In that situation, that is, if the mudgar operates in the ghat, etc., if it is struck by the mudgar, then what can it spoil? That is, it is not capable of doing anything. If, instead of considering it paryudasa, the use of nay is considered to be its

The Sutra Kritanga Sutra, in the sense of prohibition, means that the cause of destruction, like a mallet, etc., produces non-existence. What is its meaning? It does not produce any feeling or object. By the word "non-existence," only the action is prohibited. A mallet, etc., a pot, etc., do not produce any substance, because substances are produced by their own causes. If it is said that the non-existence of feeling-non-feeling is called non-existence by the word "non-existence," then it should be understood that that non-existence is produced by a mallet, etc., but this is not the case, because non-existence is a state of non-existence, it is formless. How can the action of the agents, the producers, be possible in it? If there is also an effort or use of agents for non-existence, then it should also be possible for it to produce horns on a donkey, but this never happens. Therefore, a mallet, etc., has no agency in the cause of destruction, but substances are produced by their own nature in an impermanent form. Therefore, there is no obstacle to their being momentary; they are indeed momentary.

The use of the word "tu" in the present verse is to indicate the difference between the present view and the views of the previous Jain thinkers, which have been discussed earlier. This is expressed in the latter half of the present verse, in the next two lines, by the words "anno ananno." Its meaning is that the Sankhya school accepts five elements and a sixth soul, and at the same time believes that the soul is distinct from the elements, and the Charvaka school considers the soul to be inseparable or identical with the five elements. The Buddhists, like both of them, do not accept the existence of the soul. In short, they do not accept the eternal, infinite, and permanent soul, which is produced from the five elements that have become transformed into the form of the body.

"Pudhvi aou teuu ya, taha vaau ya egau."
"Chattari dhauno ruvam, ev mahansu avare." ||18||
Shadow - Earth, water, fire, and air are one.
Four forms of the elements, thus say others.
Translation - In another tradition of Buddhists, it is believed that earth, water, fire, and air are the four elements or forms of the elements. When these four become one, transformed into the form of the body, then they are called by the name of "jiva."
Commentary - And other Buddhists say that this world is made up of four elements, to show this, it is said - Earth is an element, water is an element, fire and air are also elements, because they are the holders and nourishers. "Egau" means that when these four become one in form, in the form of the body, then they are called "jiva." And thus they say - "This body is made up of four elements, there is no soul other than that." "Evam ahamsu yaavareti" - These particular Buddhists say "ahu" - they have said. Sometimes the reading is "janaga." There also, this should be related to "janaka" - we, the knowers, are indeed burnt by the fire of pride. Their non-fruitfulness is evident from the fact that the doer is completely destroyed at the moment of action, because there is no connection with the fruit of the action. All the previous thinkers should be considered non-fruitful, because some accept the eternal and unchanging soul, and some do not accept the soul at all. For the sake of answering this, the previous one...

---------------------------
The statement of the self-time is explained by the appointment story "Who is the self" etc. If there is no substance called self other than the five aggregates, then from its absence, who experiences happiness, sorrow, etc.? The story is to be explained as before. Thus, from the absence of the self, this self-known experience of happiness and sorrow, whose is it? Consider, is this experience of the knowledge aggregate? No, because it is also momentary, and because the moment of knowledge is very subtle, there is no experience of happiness and sorrow. And because the moments of action and its result are completely incompatible, there is the fall into destruction and non-arrival. If there is a single stream of knowledge, then from the absence of anything other than that stream, this is something. If the previous moment will leave a trace of vasana in the next moment, then it has been said:

"In the same stream, where the vasana of karma is placed! The result binds there, just as redness in cotton?"

Here also this is doubtful - is that vasana separate from the moments or not separate? If it is separate, then the non-existence of the vasana-maker is not established. If it is not separate, then like the moment, it is destroyed with the moment. Thus, in the absence of the self, there would be no experience of happiness and sorrow. But there is the experience of happiness and sorrow, therefore there is the self. Otherwise, after the experience of the five objects, there would be no understanding of the combination of the sense-knowledges not being directed towards their own objects. If it is said that it will be from the storehouse consciousness, then the self is admitted by another cognition. Thus, the Buddhist scriptures also advocate the self, and this is it:

"In this ninety-ninth kalpa, I was killed by the powerful man. By the result of that karma, I am pierced in the foot, O monks!" ||1||

Similarly - "The karmas done are very terrible, they are experienced in the self by reproach. I speak of their complete eradication from the root by illumination and concealment." ||2||

And so on. Also, what is said to establish momentariness, such as "A substance, arising from causes, is either eternal or non-eternal," etc., there, in the eternal, there is no possibility of the eternal side because there is no activity of the causes in the unchanging, unproduced, stable, single nature, and because there is no possibility of the eternal side because there is no activity of the causes in the unchanging, unproduced, stable, single nature, and because there is no possibility of the eternal side because there is no activity of the causes in the unchanging, unproduced, stable, single nature, and because there is no possibility of the eternal side because there is no activity of the causes in the unchanging, unproduced, stable, single nature, and because there is no possibility of

This Sutra-Kritanga Sutra is also incorrect, because it is observed that the destruction of a pot, etc., occurs immediately after the action of a hammer, etc. Now, it is said, "What is done to the pot, etc., by the hammer, etc.?" This is indeed said, but it is incorrect. For, this which is posited by the two alternatives of "presumption" and "exclusion," has a fault in both sides. Because, in the case of exclusion, how can the hammer, etc., do anything to the pot, etc., since the pot, etc., becomes a skull-like form due to its impermanence, and thus attains that form? And, the presumption-based denial does not make the object, so it is based on the denial of action. What then? Among the four, namely, prior non-existence, destruction-non-existence, and other absolute non-existences, destruction-non-existence is posited here. There, the action of the agents does occur, because that which is posited is not merely non-existence, but a particular state, and since that particular state is of the nature of existence, and since it is active due to the previous instruction, the very production of the skull, etc., is the destruction of the pot, etc., so the destruction is established as having a cause. Moreover, it is to be understood that destruction is caused by the fact that it occurs sometimes. For the sake of the arrangement of objects, and for the sake of the arrangement of words, the four types of non-existence are to be accepted. It is said, "The object and the material are without beginning, when prior non-existence is destroyed, and when destruction-non-existence is destroyed, it goes to infinity." "That which is all-pervading is one, by the exclusion of others, etc." Thus, since the momentary is incapable of being examined, the side of impermanence of transformation is better. And thus, the true self is the transformer, the support of knowledge, the one who undergoes change, different from the elements in some way, united with the body, not different from others due to the continuity of others, and also having a cause, not a hell-being, an animal, a human, or a god, because it is being transformed by the karma that produces these states, and because it is of the nature of a synonym. Thus, the eternal doctrine is also caused by the non-destruction of the nature of the self. And since the self is established as being distinct from the body, "The body is only the four elements, this is the raving of a madman, it should be ignored." Enough of this discussion. ||18||

If there is self-time statement authority, then who can experience the happiness and sorrow known by oneself - this is a matter of contemplation. If it is said that this experience of happiness and sorrow is the subject of the knowledge skandha, then it does not seem appropriate to state so because the knowledge skandha is also momentary - the moment is permanent. Knowledge, being extremely subtle, cannot experience happiness and sorrow. (There is a great difference between the substance that acts and the substance that receives its fruit. They are very consistent with each other. This being so, the two defects of Kritnash and Akritagam, which have been discussed earlier, come into your opinion. If you say that the knowledge lineage - the thread or sequence of knowledge is one, therefore the knowledge lineage that acts is the same one that enjoys its fruit, therefore there are no defects of Kritnash and Akritagam, it is not consistent - it is not logical. Therefore, no fruit is produced from that knowledge lineage. If it is said that the former substance, in the former moment, destroys itself by basing or establishing its desire in the latter substance, in the latter moment, then as it has been said - the fruit is realized in the same knowledge lineage in which the karma desire is present or situated - the fruit is produced in the same. For example, the fruit is produced in the cotton that has redness. Here also, the option arises that whether that desire is separate from the moments, from the momentary substances, or is inseparable. If it is separate, then the desire cannot produce the desire. That desire cannot desire that momentary substance. If it is inseparable, then like the moment, it too will be destroyed in a moment. Therefore, if there is no soul, no existence, then there can be no enjoyment of happiness and sorrow, but the reality is that happiness and sorrow are experienced in this world, therefore the existence of the soul is definitely proved. If there is no soul, then after experiencing the five objects of smell, form, taste, touch and sound, I have known all five objects, this collective knowledge is not obtained because the knowledge of each sense does not go to another place or to the object of another sense. If it is said that the collective knowledge of all five objects is obtained simultaneously by the Alaya-vijnana, then by saying so, you have accepted the soul by another name. There is also an Agam-shastra text in the Buddhist Agamas that advocates the soul. For example, on one occasion, when a thorn pricked Buddha's foot, when the monks asked - why did this happen, then he says that eighty-four kalpas ago, I injured a man with a weapon with a sharp point, O monks! This thorn is stuck in my foot as a result of that karma. It has also been said - the very cruel, merciless or ruthless karma done by humans becomes lighter by self-reproach or self-criticism. By publishing them - by telling them openly in front of everyone, by repenting and repenting for them, by not doing them again, they are completely eradicated or destroyed.
1
To prove that substance is momentary, the Buddhists said that the substance that is produced from its causes, whether that substance is produced eternally or impermanently, it is not appropriate to raise such an option because the substance that is eternal is free from production and destruction. It is neither produced nor destroyed. It remains stable - always in one form and is of one nature. Therefore, the business of causes cannot happen in it. It is unconnected with causes, therefore eternity

It is illogical to assume that substances are produced from the **Sutrakritanga Sutra** and then argue for the permanence of substances that are produced.  The argument that permanent substances cannot act sequentially or simultaneously applies equally to the theory of impermanence, as impermanent substances also require cooperating causes to act sequentially or simultaneously.  Cooperating causes are necessary for their production, as materials and resources are what bring about the work.  No single substance can bring about the work.  However, cooperating causes cannot produce any excess or peculiarity in an impermanent substance, as an impermanent substance, due to its impermanence, is not capable of being known by the intellect and therefore cannot be established as having excess.  Furthermore, impermanent substances are not mutually beneficial or beneficiaries of each other.  In such a situation, there is also a lack of cooperation between them.  They cannot become cooperating causes.  Without cooperating causes, specific actions cannot be produced.  Therefore, it is more logical to consider substances as impermanent rather than momentary.  Substances are produced from their causes.  They are produced as impermanent.  Accepting the other side of this argument is also not logical.  This side should also be criticized by considering that substances are momentary, meaning they perish in an instant.  Therefore, they are impermanent, or they transform into various forms, and therefore are impermanent.  If it is accepted that substances are momentary, meaning they perish in an instant, then they are impermanent.  According to this view, no substance can be the cause of another substance, nor can any substance be the effect of a cause.  If all substances are only permanent for an instant, then who will be the cause of whom and who will be the effect of whom?  In such a situation, the activity of causation by perishable substances that perish in an instant is also not possible.  How can it be accepted that impermanent substances that perish in an instant are produced from causes?  If it is said that the subsequent substance is produced from the preceding substance that exists for only an instant, then even momentary substances can be causes of each other.  Causes can transform into effects.  Thus, it is not logical to assume that there is a cause-and-effect relationship between them.  A question arises here: does the preceding momentary substance itself perish and then produce the subsequent substance, or does it produce the subsequent substance without perishing?  If it is said that the preceding substance itself perishes and then produces the subsequent substance, then this explanation is also not appropriate.  How can a substance that itself perishes produce others?  If it is said that the preceding substance produces the subsequent substance without perishing, then this is also not true, as the activity of the preceding substance would still exist at the time of the existence of the subsequent substance, and the theory of momentariness would not hold.  If it is said that just as one side of a balance scale lowers itself and raises the other side, in the same way the preceding substance lowers itself and raises the subsequent substance, then this is also not logical.  The preceding substance cannot lower itself and raise the subsequent substance, as the preceding substance is itself perishable and does not have the capacity to raise the subsequent substance.  Therefore, the theory of momentariness is not logical.  It is not possible for a substance to be produced from another substance that is itself perishable.  Therefore, it is more logical to consider substances as impermanent rather than momentary.  Substances are produced from their causes.  They are produced as impermanent.  This is the only logical conclusion.

The statement that a substance, while undergoing decay, produces a subsequent substance, is not justified. If we accept this, it is clear that both substances would exist simultaneously, which contradicts the principle of क्षणभंगवाद (Kṣaṇabhanga). The decay of a substance is not separate from the substance itself; it is inseparable. Similarly, the state of being produced (उत्पन्नमान) is inseparable from the substance being produced.

It is important to consider that accepting both production and decay simultaneously would imply that the previous substance and the subsequent substance, along with their inherent qualities, would exist simultaneously. If production and decay are not considered inherent qualities of substances, then they would not be considered objects at all; their existence as objects would not occur.

The statement that the production of substances is the cause of their destruction can be refuted as follows: If the production of substances were the cause of their destruction, then no substance should ever be produced, because the cause of their destruction (production) is already present. If we say that destruction occurs after production, then it would occur at the time of production, or at the very next moment after production. It would not occur after a long time. Why is this? How can this be refuted? If we say that the cause of destruction does not exist, then destruction would not occur after a long time, because it has been said that destruction occurs without a cause; it is inherent. This statement is also not justified, because we see in the world that the destruction of a pot, etc., occurs only after being struck by a hammer, etc. If you say that we have already stated that a hammer, etc., cannot destroy a pot, etc., then this is not factual. You may have said this, but simply saying it does not make it true. Your statement is not based on logic, because according to the meaning of नय (naya) in the context of absence (अभाव), based on पर्युदास (paryudāsa) and प्रसज्जप्रतिषेध (prasajjapratiṣedha), a hammer, etc., produces pieces of the pot in the form of shards, etc., separate from the pot. The pot is impermanent (अनित्य) and subject to change (परिणमनशील), so it transforms into shards. Therefore, how can a hammer, etc., not destroy a pot? प्रसज्जप्रतिषेध prohibits action, which cannot be accepted here. However, among the different types of absence (अभाव) – प्राग्भाव (prāgabhāva), प्रध्वंसाभाव (pradhvaṃsābhāva), अत्यंताभाव (atyantābhāva), and अन्योन्याभाव (anyonyābhāva) – प्रध्वंसाभाव is accepted here. In प्रध्वंसाभाव, the action of the cause is involved. In fact, it is a synonym for a substance, a particular state or condition of the substance, not just absence. That state or condition is भाव (bhāva) – a state of being. Therefore, it arises by destroying the previous state. Thus, the production of shards, etc., is the destruction of the pot. This proves that destruction is caused by a cause. It is produced by a cause. It is कादाचित्क (kādaचितka) – it happens sometimes, not always. Therefore, it is also proven that it is caused by a cause.

To maintain the proper order of substances, it is necessary to accept four types of absence. It has been said that if we reject प्राग्भाव (prāgabhāva), then there will be no substance, etc., in the form of an effect. There will be no beginning or origin of any effect. If we do not accept प्रध्वंसाभाव (pradhvaṃsābhāva), then there will be no end (प्रच्यव) of a substance; it will become infinite. If we contradict अन्योन्याभाव (anyonyābhāva), then its existence will be accepted.

---------------------------
The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra states that if one does not accept the Jain principles, then one object will become all objects. Thus, the concept of momentariness or Kshanabhangavada is not logical. It is illogical to think in that way, therefore, an object or substance is impermanent because it is transient. It is appropriate to believe so.
This soul is a result of transformation. It is the basis of knowledge. It is a transmigrator, going to other births, obtaining a new birth due to its own karma. Therefore, it is different from the past in some way. It exists in conjunction with the body through mutual knowledge. Therefore, it is also inseparable from it, distinct from it. It is also inseparable. This soul is transformed into different forms by the karmas that lead to hell, animal life, human life, and godhood. Therefore, the soul does not deviate from its own nature. Its own nature is never destroyed. Therefore, it is eternal and without cause-and-effect transformation. Thus, even after it is proven that the soul is different from the body, to believe that it is made up of four elements, that it is just the body, is like the ramblings of a madman, which is not worth listening to by a wise man.
Those who believe in other non-Jain philosophies say that those who live in houses, householders, those who live in the forest, forest dwellers or ascetics, those who are renunciates, who have taken renunciation or initiation and become monks, those who accept our principles, are freed from all kinds of suffering.
Commentary: The author of the sutra wants to refute the views of those who believe in the five elements, the non-dual soul, the soul being the same as the body, the six moments, the five aggregates, and the momentary nature of the five aggregates. He wants to show that their views are fruitless. He says:
"A house is a house, those who live in it, those who dwell in it, are householders. Those who live in the forest, ascetics, and renunciates, such as the Buddhists, are also possible. They believe that those who accept our teachings, our philosophy, are freed from all suffering. The singular form in the sutra is used to refer to the aryas, because the view of those who believe in the five elements, the soul, and the body is:
"Just as those who accept our teachings are householders, they are freed from all suffering, such as shaving the head, wearing a staff, a loincloth, matted hair, saffron robes, cutting off hair, fire penance, bodily hardship. And they say: "Penances are various tortures, restraint is deception of enjoyment. Agnihotra and other rituals are like children's play." The Samkhyas and others who believe in liberation believe that those who accept our teachings, which are based on non-action, non-dual soul, and the five aggregates, are renunciates, and they are freed from all suffering, such as birth, old age, death, the cycle of birth and death, and the intense suffering of the body and mind. They attain liberation, which is freedom from all duality."

**Self-Time Statement of Authority**

Commentary: Now, in order to demonstrate the futility of the five-element theory, the theory of the soul's duality, the theory of the soul and body being the same, the theory of non-action, the theory of the soul's sixth category, and the theory of the five aggregates being momentary, from the perspective of achieving liberation, we will first present their respective views.

The word "agar" means "house," and those who reside there are "agari" or householders. Those who live in the forest are "vanaprastha" or ascetics, and those who have accepted "pravrajya-upasampada" or initiation, the "shakya" and other "shramanas," believe that those who accept our philosophy, our principles, are liberated from all suffering. The word "api" is used here in the sense of possibility. Due to the use of the Vedic language, the singular form is used in the sutra instead of the plural.

The five-element theorists and those who believe the soul and body are the same have the view that those who accept our philosophy, while remaining householders, avoid the painful bodily afflictions of shaving their heads, carrying a staff and deer skin, wearing matted hair, saffron robes, cutting their hair, and remaining naked. They say that austerities are various forms of torture and suffering. Accepting restraint is to be deprived of worldly pleasures, and rituals like fire sacrifices are meaningless like children's play.

Those who believe in liberation, those who have faith in the Samkhya philosophy, believe that those who accept our philosophy, which advocates non-action, non-duality, and the theory of the five aggregates being the soul, and who become renunciants, initiated, or accept sannyasa, are freed from birth, old age, death, the cycle of repeated births, and various intense bodily and mental afflictions. They attain liberation, free from all conflicts and troubles.

"Te na api sandhim jnatva, na te dharmavido janah. Ye te tu vaidino evam, na te oghaantara akhyatah." (20)

Commentary: Now, to demonstrate the futility of their views, it is said: "Te" - the five-element theorists, "na api" - not even, "sandhim" - the gap, the opening, which is of two types due to the difference in the nature of substance. There is the "dravya sandhi" - the gap in substance, like a house, and the "bhavasandhi" - the gap in the state of being, like the covering of knowledge, karma, and other forms of obstruction. "Tam jnatva" - not knowing this, "te" - they, "pravrittah" - have embarked on this path. This is a figure of speech, just as the gap between the self and action is characterized by duality, so too, without understanding, they have embarked on this path for the sake of liberation from suffering. As they are, so it will be demonstrated in part and will be further demonstrated. Or, if "sandhana" - understanding, "sandhi" - the progressive knowledge of objects, "tad jnatva" - not knowing this, "pravrittah" - they have embarked on this path. And since they are not experts in the proper understanding of dharma, "janah" - the people, the five-element theorists and others. For, they advocate dharma in various ways, not knowing the tenfold dharma of patience, etc., and because of the lack of results, their views are futile, which will be further explained in the subsequent chapters.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra
**At the end of the summary, it is shown - 'Ye te tviti' is a word and its meaning, which is used after 'ya'. Those who are like this, as mentioned earlier, are non-believers, etc., and they are not able to cross the ocean of existence, which is the ocean of suffering. This is the meaning of the verse. ||20||**

**Commentary:** Those who believe in the previously mentioned principles do not believe in the fruit. They are non-fruit believers. To express this, the Agamkar says -

Those who believe in the five great elements, etc., do not know the meaning of the word 'Shandhi'. The meaning of 'Shandhi' is a hole, a gap, or a cavity. This hole, gap, or cavity is of two types, depending on the substance and the feeling - the 'Shandhi' that is found in a wall or a house is called 'Dravya Shandi'. And the 'Shandhi' or the connection that is found in the form of karma like 'Jnana Avaraniya', etc., is called 'Bhav Shandi'. Those who believe in the previously mentioned principles do not know this 'Bhav Shandi' and are engaged in action. They do not understand the nature of karma bondage and perform actions. Here, the word 'Nam' is used in the sentence structure for the sake of sentence arrangement. Its meaning is that without knowing how the soul can be free from karma, how it can be separated from the connection of karma, they strive to get rid of suffering. They are of the category of those who believe in other philosophies. This has been briefly stated earlier. It will be further explained as the occasion arises.

**This part of the verse also has this meaning - the meaning of 'Shandhi' is to gain knowledge of more and more substances, one after the other. Those other philosophers do not do this, i.e., they do not strive to gain more and more knowledge of substances, and yet they are engaged in action. Again, the commentator clarifies that those who believe in other philosophies like the five elements, etc., are not able to understand the true nature of religion, because they do not know 'Shandhi'. They do not understand the process of karma connecting with the soul. Patience, forgiveness, etc., are the ten characteristics of religion. Religion is of this nature. Those other philosophers do not understand the essence of religion. Therefore, they describe other things in place of religion - things that are not religion. They explain them, but the religion explained by them, the things said in the name of religion, do not have any fruit. Therefore, they are called non-fruit believers. Taking the ultimate intention of the speaker, the Agamkar describes it with the word 'Ye te tviti'. Here, the word 'Tum' is used in the sense of 'Cha'. Therefore, it should be used after the word 'Ye'. Thus, the meaning of this verse is that those who believe in the doctrines that have been discussed earlier, those who state them, non-believers, etc., cannot cross the ocean of existence, i.e., they cannot be freed from the cycle of birth and death due to doubt.**

**Te na avi sandi nam cha nam, na te dhamma vio jana. Jete u vaino evam na te sansara paraga. ||21||**

**Shadow:**
**Te na api sandi jnatva, na te dharmavido jana. Ye te tu vadin evam na te sansara paraga. ||**

Page #81:
---------------------------
The translation preserving the Jain terms is as follows:

They do not know the Sandhi (union or connection) in other philosophies, and they are not people who know the Dharma. Those who are such debaters, they are not able to cross over the Garbha (cycle of birth and death).

They do not know the Sandhi, and they are not people who know the Dharma. Those who are such debaters, they are not able to cross over the Janma (birth).

They do not know the Sandhi, and they are not people who know the Dharma. Those who are such debaters, they are not able to cross over the Duhkha (suffering).

They do not know the Sandhi, and they are not people who know the Dharma. Those who are such debaters, they are not able to cross over the Mara (death).

##  Śrī Sūtrakrtaṅga Sūtra, Chāyā and Anuvāda:

**Chāyā:**  They do not know the nature of the agreement, nor are they free from the bondage of karma. Those who argue like this are not truly liberated from death.

**Anuvāda:**  Those who believe in non-Jain doctrines do not understand the nature of the agreement. They are not aware of the process of karma-bandha. They do not know the nature of Dharma. They engage in actions arbitrarily. They do whatever they please in the name of Dharma. They cannot transcend death because those who are born must inevitably die.

**Tīkā:**  And thus, those who argue like this are not liberated from the birth, suffering, and death of the womb of the world.

**Tīkā-artha:**  The commentator, summarizing verses 21 to 25, states that those previously discussed are proponents of false doctrines, propagating falsehood. Therefore, they wander in this ocean of the world, are born in the womb, take birth, experience various kinds of suffering, and finally die. This cycle continues.

**Chāyā:**  They experience various kinds of suffering again and again. They wander in the cycle of the world, filled with death, disease, and old age.

**Anuvāda:**  Those who hold false views experience various kinds of suffering again and again. They wander in this world, filled with death, disease, and old age, trapped in the cycle of existence.

**Tīkā:**  To show what they experience, the Āgama-kāra says, "They experience various kinds of suffering, which are characterized by the arising of the non-self."  For example, in hell, they are torn apart by saws, cooked in cauldrons, wrapped in hot iron, and embraced by thorny Śālmalī trees. In the animal realm, they are born and experience cold, heat, suppression, pain, branding, being burned with hot iron, beating, being burdened with excessive weight, and the suffering of hunger and thirst. In the human realm, they experience the separation from loved ones, the association with the undesirable, sorrow, and crying. In the realm of the gods, they experience accusations, slander, poison, and falling from their position, among many other kinds of suffering. Those who argue like this experience these sufferings repeatedly. This half-verse applies to all the subsequent verses. The rest is easy to understand, as the purpose is fulfilled.

Page #83:
---------------------------
## The Statement of the Right Time

**Painful Events** - As a result of various sorrows, one has to experience pain in the form of grief, weeping, lamentations, etc. In the realm of gods, due to the high and low positions of gods, those in lower positions experience sorrow, envy, inferior games and entertainment, and after the decline of merit, they suffer various kinds of pain. The implication is that those who hold false doctrines repeatedly experience these sorrows. The latter part of this verse should be combined with the latter part of all the verses. The rest is easy to understand until the end.

**High and Low**

**Naya Putra**
Those who go to high and low places will enter the womb endlessly.
The great hero, the best Jina, Mahavira, says so.
-
They go, they will be born in the womb endlessly. Mahavira, the best Jina, says so. ||27||

**Translation** - The great hero, the descendant of the knowers, Mahavira, declared that those who hold false views wander in the best and worst realms and repeatedly enter the womb, are born, and die.

**Commentary** - The word "Ucchavacani" refers to the various types of dwelling places, both low and high, that they go to. They wander from womb to womb, entering endlessly and without interruption. Sudharmaswami says to Jambuswami, "I say this according to the command of the Tirthankara, not according to my own intellect. I say what I have heard from the Tirthankara. This refutes the theory of momentariness."

**End of the First Chapter of the Samakhya**

The commentary concludes the previous context by saying that those who have been discussed go to different dwelling places, both low and high, in different realms. They wander from one womb to another. This cycle continues endlessly and uninterrupted. Sudharmaswami says to Jambuswami, "Jambuswami, I speak only what is commanded by the Tirthankara. I do not speak from my own intellect. I speak only what I have heard from the Tirthankara, the Lord Mahavira, who established the path of Dharma. This refutes the theory of momentariness because if the one who heard was momentary, then the listener would have perished at that very moment. How can I, who am speaking today, be the listener? But the reality is that I, the listener and speaker, exist today in the same form. I am speaking what I heard. This proves the theory of momentariness to be false."

Thus, the first chapter of the Samakhya, called "Time," ends.

**The Sutra Kritanga Sutra, Second Uddesaka**

It is said by some that the jivas are all separate and distinct. They experience happiness and suffering separately, and they also die and are reborn separately.

**Commentary:**

The second Uddesaka of the first chapter begins here. The first Uddesaka has been discussed, and now the second is being explained. The connection between them is this: In the following Uddesaka, the views of the Bhutas, etc., are presented and refuted. Here, the remaining views of the Niyativadis, etc., are presented and refuted.

Alternatively, in the previous Uddesaka, it was said that "one should understand bondage and break it." This bondage does not exist according to the Niyativadis. Thus, this Uddesaka is connected to the previous one. The four types of Anuyoga should be applied to this Sutra, and the Sutra should be recited with the qualities of accuracy, etc.

The connection with the following Sutra should be explained. The connection is this: In the following Sutra, it is said that those who are deluded by the views of the five elements, etc., are ignorant of the true Self and are trapped in the cycle of samsara. They wander through the world, experiencing pain, death, and old age, and they search for liberation. Here, the same cycle of samsara is explained, but it is said that it is due to the four types of karma, ignorance, and knowledge.

The connection with the previous Sutra is also important. In the previous Sutra, it was said that "one should understand." Here, it is said that the Niyativadis understand. Thus, the connection with the previous Sutras should be established as much as possible.

Now, the meaning of this Sutra, which is connected to the previous and following Sutras, is explained. The word "punar" (again) indicates a difference from the previous view. It is said by some Niyativadis that...

The word "akhyatam" (said) is in the passive voice, and the suffix "veni" indicates that the action is done by someone else. The sixth case ending indicates the agent of the action. Thus, the meaning is:

It is said by those Niyativadis. Their view is...

The word "upapannah" (established) means "established by reason."

This refutes the view of the five elements, the jivas, and the body. The reasoning will be presented briefly here and will be explained in detail later.

The word "prithak prithak" (separately) indicates that the jivas are not one. This refutes the view of the Advaita Vedanta, which says that the Self is one.

Who are these "prithak upapannah" (separately established)? The answer is: "jivah" (jivas), "praninah" (living beings), "sukha duhkha bhoginah" (those who experience happiness and suffering). This refutes the view of the Buddhists, who say that the jivas are not real.

These jivas are located in different bodies and experience happiness and suffering separately. We do not deny that each individual experiences suffering. This refutes the view of the Akartrivadis, who say that there is no doer. The Akartrivadis say that the Self is not a doer, and therefore it cannot experience happiness and suffering.

The word "aduve" (die) means that these living beings experience happiness and suffering, and then they die. They leave their bodies and are reborn in other bodies.

Thus, the meaning of the verse is that we refute the view of the Niyativadis, who say that the jivas are separate and distinct.

**Verse 1:**

It is said by some that the jivas are all separate and distinct. They experience happiness and suffering separately, and they also die and are reborn separately.

## Self-Time Statement Authority

**Commentary**

This section continues from the first objective, which has already been discussed. It is connected to the first objective. The first objective outlined the principles of Self-Time (Jain philosophy) and Other-Time (theories of other schools of thought). This second objective further elaborates on the first objective, or rather, the discussion of Self-Time and Other-Time is connected to this second objective. Alternatively, the first objective presented the views of other theorists like the Panch-Bhootvadis and refuted them. Now, this study will present the views of the remaining theorists like the Niyativadis and other non-right-view theorists and refute them. Alternatively, the first objective stated that humans should understand the nature of bondage and then break it, destroy it. However, according to the views of other theorists like the Niyativadis, bondage does not exist. This objective will shed light on this. Thus, after describing the four Anuyog Dwars of this objective, which are connected through various relationships, it is stated that in the Sutra-Angam, it is expected to pronounce the sutra with qualities like flawless pronunciation, etc.

The present sutra is directly connected to another sutra without any interruption, and it is also connected to other sutras, which are interrupted by other sutras. The next sutra states that the intellect of those who believe in the five great elements, those who describe them, and those who believe in the five skandhas, has been destroyed by falsehood. This is the reason why they are attached to false substances. They are devoid of true knowledge of the essence of reality. They are afflicted by disease, death, and old age, and they wander in the cycle of existence, going to higher and lower births, endlessly moving from one womb to another, being born and dying. The same applies here. The Niyativadis and the Agnanavadis, who do not consider the four types of karma as binding, also wander in the cycle of existence like other philosophers. They move from one womb to another. 'Bujjhijjā' etc. is the traditional sutra here. Its connection with this sutra is as follows: 'Bujjhijjā' etc. states that the soul should attain knowledge. This also connects here. The Niyativadis also state that one should attain knowledge. Similarly, its connection with the sutras in between should be made wherever possible. Thus, the meaning of this sutra, which is connected to the previous and subsequent sutras, is explained here in detail. The word 'punah' (again) used here highlights the characteristic of the Niyativadis in comparison to the previous theorists.

According to grammar, verbs whose action is not desired, whose action is not considered worthy of being spoken, become intransitive. Therefore, the word 'ākhyāt' used here has the suffix 'niṣṭhā' in the sense of 'bhāva' (state). When this happens, the sixth case (ṣaṣṭhī vibhakti) is used in the word 'agetim' for the agent (kartṛ). Thus, its meaning is that these Niyativadi theorists have said this, i.e., this is their intention.

Through reasoning and logic, the existence of souls is established. This statement refutes the views of the Panch-Bhootvadis and the Taj-Jiva-Tatch-Sharirvadis. The reasoning by which the aforementioned theories are refuted has been presented earlier. Later, its...

Page #86:
---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** and its commentary will be discussed.  Living beings (Jivas) are born in different hells, realms, and species, or in different bodies. This should be understood as refuting or negating the theory of soul-monism.  What are the things that are individually obtained or proven by logic? They are the living beings (Jivas) or creatures. They are the ones who experience happiness and sorrow. This argument refutes the Buddhist theory that there is no living being (Jiva) besides the five aggregates (Panchaskandha). They do not accept the existence of a living being (Jiva).  Living beings (Jivas) reside in different bodies, one by one, and experience happiness and sorrow. The experience of happiness and sorrow, which every creature feels, cannot be called false. This refutation negates the view of those who do not accept the agency of the living being (Jiva) or soul, because if the soul is inactive and unchanging, then it cannot experience happiness and sorrow. Creatures experience happiness and sorrow. When their lifespan is complete, they become extinct, cut off, and fall, meaning their connection with the body is extinguished and they leave one place, one realm, and move to another realm. This cannot be called false. Thus, we do not deny the transmigration of living beings (Jivas) from one realm to another, their birth, or their going. This is the meaning of this verse.

**Verse:**

* **Not self-made is sorrow, nor made by another, how could it be?**
* **Happiness or sorrow, whether natural or unnatural.**
* **Not self-made, but experienced by individual living beings.**
* **This is the collective experience of these beings, as stated here.**

**Translation:**

* **Worldly beings experience two types of sorrow: one caused by external factors and the other without any cause.**
* **This sorrow is neither their own doing nor done by another. It is ordained by fate.**
* **This is the statement of the fatalists.**

**Commentary:**

* **Thus, by refuting the view of those who believe in the existence of the five elements, the fatalists argue their point in these two verses.**
* **They say that the happiness and sorrow experienced by living beings, as well as the loss of their place, is not self-made or caused by their own actions.**
* **The word "sorrow" is used to refer to the cause of sorrow, due to the conventional usage of the word "cause" for the effect.**
* **Since this is a general term, it also includes happiness and other things.**
* **Therefore, if it is said that this experience of happiness and sorrow is not caused by one's own actions, then how could it be caused by another, such as a god, fate, or natural law?**
* **The word "not" in the verse is used for emphasis.**
* **If happiness and other experiences were caused by one's own actions, then servants, merchants, and those who exploit others would all be equal.**

If the attainment of results were due to human effort, then there would be no difference in the attainment of results, nor would there be any non-attainment of results. Even in the absence of service or other activities, the attainment of specific results would be possible. Therefore, what is attained from human effort? It is only **niyati** (destiny). This will be explained in the second verse. Time is also not the doer, because due to its uniformity in the world, the diversity of results would not be possible. For, in the difference of causes, there is a difference in effects, not in the absence of difference. For example, this difference is the cause of difference, or it becomes the cause of difference, namely, the attribution of opposite qualities and the difference in causes. Even if the Lord is the doer, there would not be happiness and sorrow, because is the Lord embodied or unembodied? If embodied, then like a worldly man, he would not be the doer of everything. If unembodied, then like the true sky, he would be completely inactive. Moreover, if he has attachment, etc., then due to his non-difference from us, the whole world would be inactive. If he is free from attachment, then the diversity of the world, such as prosperity, misfortune, lordship, poverty, etc., would not be created by him. Therefore, the Lord is not the doer. Similarly, the nature of things is also not the doer of happiness, sorrow, etc., because is nature different from or non-different from the soul? If different, then it is not possible for it to be the doer of happiness and sorrow, which are dependent on the soul, because of its difference. Nor is it non-different, because in non-difference, the soul itself would be the doer, and its non-doing is already established. Nor is karma the doer of happiness and sorrow, because is karma different from or non-different from the soul? If non-different, then karma would be the same as the soul, and the defect mentioned there would arise. If different, then is it conscious or unconscious? If conscious, then there would be two consciousnesses in one body. If unconscious, then how can it be the doer of the production of happiness and sorrow, like a piece of stone? This will be explained in detail later. Therefore, enough of this digression. Thus, happiness is theoretical, being the characteristic of liberation, or sorrow is non-theoretical, being the characteristic of non-liberation, worldly. Or both happiness and sorrow are real, being established in the enjoyment of things like clothes, sandalwood, and women, or being established in things like being beaten with a stick, being branded, etc., theoretical. Similarly, other happiness, which is in the form of bliss, is accidental, not determined by external causes, and is non-theoretical. Similarly, sorrow, which is in the form of fever, headache, pain, etc., is bodily and non-theoretical. Both of these are not done by the soul itself, nor are they done by anyone else, such as time, etc. This is experienced by individual living beings. How then did it happen to them? The **niyati** (destiny) theorist reveals his opinion: "**Sang** (association)". (The movement of the self with its own transformation - the experience of happiness and sorrow, wherever and whenever it is, is **sangati** (association), **niyati** (destiny). What happens in it is **sangatik** (associated with destiny). Since happiness and sorrow, etc., are not done by human effort, etc., therefore, they are said to be done by **niyati** (destiny) for those living beings. In this theory of the experience of happiness and sorrow, it is said by some theorists that this is their assumption. Thus it is said: "Whatever is obtained by relying on the power of **niyati** (destiny), that surely happens to humans, whether auspicious or inauspicious. Even with great effort on the part of beings, what is not to be, does not become, and what is to be, does not perish." (2/3) _Commentary - After refuting the views of the five-element theorists, etc., the **niyati** (destiny) theory is now presented in the next two verses. The experiences of happiness and sorrow that are experienced by living beings in the world are not done by their own efforts. Similarly, going from one existence to another - being born in one womb to another - is also not accomplished by one's own efforts. Here, in this verse, the effect is dealt with in the cause, and the word "duhkha" (sorrow) is used to establish the cause of sorrow. The word "duhkha" (sorrow) is suggestive, therefore, happiness, etc., should also be taken from it. The meaning of this statement is that the experience of happiness and sorrow is not capable of being generated or produced by the efforts of living beings. And how can it be done by other things like time, the Supreme Being, nature, and karma, etc.? That is, it is not done by them either. Here, the word "ṇam" is used for the sake of the figure of speech called **vakyalankara** (sentence ornament). If the experience of happiness, etc., were to be obtained as a result of one's own efforts, then the servant, the master, and the farmer, etc., would all have the same effort - they all work hard in their own way - but despite this, the results are different, or sometimes the results are not obtained at all. (59)

---------------------------
The 'Sutrakritanga Sutra' is not available. Some people experience specific results even without engaging in service or other activities. We see this in the world. This proves that nothing is achieved through effort or endeavor, but happiness and other things are obtained only through destiny. We will discuss this further in the next verse.

It is also not possible that time, happiness, and suffering are the creators or makers of anything. Time has a single form - it always remains the same. The fruits in the world appear in various and diverse forms. This cannot happen due to the single form of time. When there is a difference in the cause, there is a difference in the effect accordingly. When there is no difference in the cause, there is no difference in the effect. Taking refuge in opposing dharma or a different cause is the reason for this difference.

Similarly, happiness and suffering are not caused by God or the Supreme Being. The question arises whether that Supreme Being is embodied or disembodied. If He is embodied, then He is like an ordinary man, and He cannot be the creator or performer of all things. If He is disembodied, then He is completely inactive like the sky. If that Supreme Being is attached like us, like worldly people, then He cannot be considered the creator of the world. If He is free from attachment, then He cannot create this diverse world with its beautiful, ugly, pleasant, and unpleasant, rich and poor forms. Therefore, God is not the creator.

Nature cannot be the creator of happiness and suffering either. The question arises whether nature is separate from or inseparable from man. If you consider it separate from man, then it is clear that it cannot produce happiness and suffering for man because it is separate from him. If nature is inseparable from man, then it is essentially man himself, and in that situation, it cannot be the creator of happiness and suffering. This has already been discussed.

Karma cannot be the creator of happiness and suffering either, because here too the question arises whether it is different from or inseparable from man. If karma is considered inseparable from man, then it is essentially man himself, nothing else. Therefore, its ability to create happiness and suffering is not proven. As mentioned earlier, considering it as the creator leads to flaws. If karma is different from or separate from man, then another question arises: is it conscious or unconscious? If it is considered conscious, then it would mean that there are two conscious beings: the living being and karma. If karma is unconscious, then it is like a piece of stone, itself dependent on others. How can it be the creator of happiness and suffering? We will discuss this in detail later, so it is not necessary to say more here.

The word 'saiddhika' has been used here. Siddhi means liberation. The happiness that arises in liberation is called saiddhika. The world is called asiddhi. The suffering that arises in the world due to the emergence of asatavedaniya karma is called asiddhika, meaning worldly suffering is asiddhika. Or it should be understood this way: happiness and suffering are both of two types: saiddhika and asiddhika. Flowers, garlands, sandalwood, beautiful women...

Page #89:
---------------------------
The happiness that arises from the action or accomplishment of consuming food, etc., is called theoretical happiness. The suffering that arises from the accomplishment or action of being beaten with a whip, being branded with hot iron, etc., is called theoretical suffering. The inner joy-like happiness that arises suddenly, whose external causes are not visible, is called non-theoretical happiness. Similarly, the suffering that arises from one's own limbs in the form of fever, headache, abdominal pain, etc., is called non-theoretical suffering. Both types of happiness and suffering do not arise from man's own efforts. Nor are they produced by time or anything else. Both types of happiness and suffering are experienced by beings separately. The question arises - why do these happiness and suffering occur to beings? To make this known, the determinist explains his opinion through the word *sangaiansanghatikam*.

*Samyak* - the movement that comes from its result is called *sangati*. This means that the situation from which the suffering of the being who is to experience happiness and suffering arises is called *sanghatik*. It is destiny. The happiness and suffering that arise from that destiny are *sanghatik*.

Thus, according to what has been said earlier, the happiness and suffering of beings are not done by their own efforts or endeavors, but are done by their destiny, therefore they are called *sanghatik*. Here, the discussion of the subject of happiness and suffering experience, which has been done by some principle theorists, is their accepted principle. It has been said - whatever material object is to be obtained, good or bad, good or bad, it will surely be obtained by man by the force of destiny. What is not to be obtained, what is not to be obtained, is not obtained by beings even after great effort. What is to be, will never perish.

*Ev meyani jampanta, bala pandiamanino. Niyayanaiyam santam, ayanamta abuddhiya. ||4||*

*Chhaya* - *Evametaani jalpanto balaha panditamaninah. Niyatanaiyatam santam majananto'buddhikaha. ||*

*Anuvaad* - Those who have been discussed earlier are the determinists, they are ignorant, but they consider themselves wise and knowledgeable, they say. In reality, happiness and suffering are fixed from one perspective and uncertain from another perspective, i.e., they are *niyatanaiyat*, but the determinists do not accept this without knowing it.

The Sutra of the Sutrakritanga says, "Thus it is: For the Arhats, some happiness and suffering, etc., are indeed determined by fate. This is because the karma that is the cause of it is destined to arise at a certain time, and is therefore said to be created by fate. However, some things are not created by fate, but by the efforts of the individual, time, the nature of the Lord, karma, etc. In this case, it is also accepted that happiness and suffering, etc., can be achieved by the efforts of the individual. For, action leads to results, and action is initiated by the efforts of the individual. As it is said: "Do not, thinking it is fate, abandon your own efforts. Without effort, who can obtain oil from sesame seeds?" (1)

The objection that there is a diversity of results in the same human activity, which is presented as a fault, is not a fault. For, even there, the diversity of human effort is the cause of the diversity of results. The lack of results for some in the same human activity is due to unseen karma. This too is accepted by us as a cause. Time is also a doer, for the flowering and fruiting of bakula, champaca, ashoka, punnaga, naga, sahakar, etc., occurs only at a specific time, not always. And what is said, "The uniformity of time does not account for the diversity of the world," is not a fault for us. For, we do not accept time alone as the doer, but also karma. Therefore, there is no fault in the diversity of the world. The Lord is also a doer. The self, which pervades the entire world through the door of birth, is the Lord. His role as the creator of happiness and suffering is established without any doubt by all. The objection that there is a distinction between the material and the immaterial, etc., is far removed when the Lord is accepted. The nature of things is also a doer in some way. For, the characteristics of the self, such as its use, its infinite extent, the material nature of the pudgalas, the movement, stability, and support provided by the bodies of virtue and vice, and their immaterial nature, etc., are all established by nature. The objection that there is a distinction between the self and its nature is also a fault. For, nature is not different from the self. And since the role of the self is accepted, this too is established by nature. Karma is also a doer. It is arranged with the regions of the living being in the form of mutual dependence, and is in some way not different from the self. Due to its influence, the self wanders in the realms of hell, animal, human, and god, experiencing happiness, suffering, etc. Thus, since the role of fate and non-fate is established by reason, those who accept the role of fate alone are foolish. This is to be understood. (4)

Commentary: The author of the text, having presented the view of the fatalists in the previous two verses, now provides a solution to it.

The word "thus" is used in the present verse to introduce the previous statement of the fatalist. Those who formulate the principles of fatalism do not have a true understanding of the nature of existence and non-existence. They are ignorant, like children. Despite this, they consider themselves wise and knowledgeable. Why are fatalists called ignorant, devoid of knowledge, and arrogant in their wisdom? The author of the text, in order to provide a solution to this potential question or curiosity, mentions fate and non-fate, and explains that many situations conducive to happiness and prosperity are determined by fate, because such karmic fruition occurs. And many situations are indeterminate, i.e., they are accidental, due to one's own efforts or some unseen power. Even so, fatalists claim that all situations conducive to happiness and prosperity, as well as suffering and adversity, are definitively determined by fate. Thus, they do not understand the true cause of happiness and suffering. They are devoid of intelligence. The Arhats, the Tirthankaras and the omniscient ones, believe that some happiness and suffering are indeed determined by fate, because the karma that is the cause of them arises at a specific time. Thus, they are indeed the result of the arising of karma, but because they arise at a specific time, in a specific way, they are considered to be within the realm of fate.

Page #91:
---------------------------
The doctrine of free will is accepted. It is said that happiness and sorrow are ordained by fate. There are many happiness and sorrows that are not considered to be ordained by fate. They are produced by a person's own efforts, time, inherent nature, and karma. Taking this view, those who believe in the Arhat-Jain religion also accept that happiness and sorrow, etc., are achievable through effort, i.e., they are caused by human effort or endeavor. The reason for this is that any result is produced or manifested by some action, and action is based on effort or endeavor. Therefore, it has been said that one should not stop trying even if one thinks that only what is written in fate will be obtained, because even a drop of oil cannot be obtained without effort or endeavor. The determinist, accusing determinism, said that although the effort or endeavor of many individuals is the same, there is a difference or variation in the results. Consider this, it is not really a fault because the effort of all those who make an effort is different according to their ability, circumstances, etc. When there is a difference in effort, how can the result be the same? Even with the same effort, some results are not obtained at all, this is the result of the hindering karmas done in the past. They are not visible, therefore they are called unseen. Jains also consider them to be the cause of happiness and sorrow. Similarly, time also has a role to play in a way, just as the Vakula, Champaka, Ashoka, Punnaga, Naga, and Amra trees do not bear fruit at the same time - in the same season. Their fruits have their own separate times to come. Karma cooperates with time in a special way. The determinist, presenting his side, said that time is a form, therefore, a world full of diversity and variations cannot be produced from it. This statement does not apply to us as a fault because we do not only accept the agency of time, but also the agency of karma. Therefore, it is due to the diversity and variety of karma that diversity or variety is seen in the world. There is no fault in our doctrine. It has been said that God is the creator of the world, in this regard, our proposition is that the soul is born in different forms of beings according to its own karmas, in this way, from one perspective, it is omnipresent, it can also be called God, that soul or God is the creator of happiness and sorrow - it produces happiness through its good karmas and sorrow through its bad karmas. There is no dispute in this regard in the doctrines of all the schools of thought in the world. It is proven according to everyone's perspective. To prove that God is the creator of happiness and sorrow, to refute it, the determinist has tried to prove the fault by raising the question whether the soul is concrete or abstract. We consider the soul to be God. There is no other God different from it according to our doctrine. Therefore, this fault does not apply to us. Nature is also an agent from one perspective because the soul is the essence of use, it is infinite in its regions. Pudgala is concrete, Dharma-stikaya is helpful in motion and Adharma-stikaya is helpful in stillness. These are abstract - all these situations are produced by nature itself. The determinist has tried to show the fault in the agency of nature by saying that nature is separate from the soul or not, this is not proven because nature is not separate from the soul. We have accepted that the soul is the agent. Therefore, the agency of the soul is inherent in nature. Karma is also called the agent

Shri Sutrakritanga Sutram

The statement in the Shri Sutrakritanga Sutram is correct because karmas or karmic particles coexist and intermingle with the regions of the jiva (living being). Therefore, from one perspective, karma is inseparable from the jiva. It is due to the results of karma that the atma (soul) goes to the gati (state of existence) of naraka (hell), tiryañca (animals and plants), manushya (human) and deva (celestial beings), and experiences happiness or suffering accordingly. In this way, the agency of niyati (destiny) and aniyati (non-destiny) is proven through logic and reasoning. Those who are solely fatalists, accepting only niyati as the doer, are to be known as devoid of proper intellect.

Evam eke tu pavasthas, te bhuyah vipragalbhitah.
Evam upadhvita santa, na te duhkhavimokshakah. (5)

Translation:
The fatalists, in the aforementioned manner, consider niyati alone as the doer of pleasure and pain - this is their arrogance and obstinate statement. Even though they engage in religious practices related to the afterlife, they are unable to attain liberation from suffering.

Page #93:
---------------------------
The statement of self-time authority is proven to be meaningless. There is another interpretation of this word. When the word 'pas' in the word 'pasattha' is taken as 'pas' instead of 'pārśva', it means that it is like 'pas', it is located near, they are called 'pas'. The meaning of 'pas' is karma-bandhana. The subject presented here is the proposition of prohibited determinism. The determinists in it are 'pasattha' - bound by karma-bandhana. Other proponents, who accept the agency of all only in time and God etc., should also be understood as 'pārśvastha' or 'pasattha'. Although determinists believe that everything is fructified by destiny, they are still inclined to perform various actions that are related to the attainment of the afterlife. This is their great audacity and arrogance. It is such a great audacity and prejudice that determinists accept the principle that everything happens only by destiny, but they perform actions that are contrary to the principle. Therefore, even while engaging in so-called religious activities that aim to attain the afterlife, they cannot free their souls from suffering. The reason is that they are not engaged in action with the knowledge of right faith and right belief. Therefore, they cannot free their souls from suffering. The discussion of determinism ends here.

The deer that are without a protector are very fickle. They doubt where there is no need to doubt, where there is no fear, and they do not fear where there is fear. Thus, those who are fearful in a safe place and fearless in a place bound by 'pas' - bondage, fall into the place bound by 'pas' due to their ignorance and fear. Similarly, those who believe in other philosophies, abandon the protection of the non-dualistic principle, like the armor of protection, and take refuge in monism, which proves to be disastrous for them.

Commentary: To refute the current view of knowledge, an example is given - just as the deer, which are swift and are forest animals, are without protection, they are without protection, meaning they are deprived of protection. Or, if the bondage is the bondage of words, etc., then they are terrified, they are afraid, their eyes are filled with fear, their minds are confused, they are deprived of right discrimination, they doubt the places that are free from false bonds, etc., and they doubt them, considering them to be producers of harm. And those that are doubtful, doubt.

Page #94:
---------------------------
The English translation preserving the Jain terms is as follows:

The Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra states that those things which are worthy of Yogyata (fitness) are considered as Shankita (doubtful) and Shankayogya (worthy of doubt), such as Vagura (fetters) and others. Those who are engaged in doubting them, they wander about in Pasha (bonds) and other such things, according to the context.

Further, to reveal the extreme delusion, it is said - "Parityrajati" (it protects). The Parityrajana (protection) born in them, those who, due to extreme foolishness, have perverted intellect, even though they are worthy of protection, apprehend fear. Similarly, the Pashita (bound) ones, i.e., those endowed with Pasha (bonds), considering them as causing Anarthapada (harm), while they themselves, out of ignorance and fear, are completely overwhelmed and subjugated, either considering the Shankaneya (doubtful) as Ashankaneya (not doubtful) or the Parityrajanopaita (endowed with protection) as Pashadi Anarthopeta (endowed with bonds and other harms), wander about in those places where there is abundance of Anartha (harm), like Pasha, Vagura, etc., getting completely absorbed in them.

Having established this illustration, the Ekantavadins (absolutists), who are the proponents of Niyativada (fatalism) and Ajnanavada (ignorance), should be refuted as Dantika (tamed), because they too, being Ekantavadins (absolutists) and Ajnanika (ignorant), devoid of Anekantavada (non-absolutism) which is the protector, apprehend the Anekantavada, which is free from all defects, by accepting the causality of Kalesvaraadi (time, God, etc.), as not worthy of doubt, while they do not doubt the Ekanta (absolute) Niyatyajnanavada (doctrine of fatalistic ignorance), though it is worthy of doubt. Being such, they, while doubting the Anekantavada which is worthy of Parityrajana (protection), considering the Ekantavada, which is logically untenable and full of Anarthas (harms), as not worthy of doubt, remain enveloped in ignorance, and wander about in those places of Karmabandha (bondage of karmas).

Page #95:
---------------------------
English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The self-proclaimed authorities and the ignorant do not doubt them, but accept them without any hesitation. Though they are afraid of the non-absolutist doctrine that provides liberation, and do not proceed in that direction, they accept the absolutist doctrine - which is against logic and reasoning, and is destructive in its consequences, as free from doubt and secure, and thus they enter the realms of karmic bondage. (2)

If that (deer) were to leap over the binding, or go beneath the binding, it would be freed from the fetters, but the dull-witted one does not see that.

Commentary: The author, not being satisfied with the previous example, presents another illustration to point out additional flaws. The term 'bandha' refers to the fence, snare or any kind of binding. If the deer, trapped in it, were to jump over it or cleverly get out from underneath, it could free itself from the fetters. But the ignorant, deluded one does not perceive this means of escape.

The self-harming one with harmful knowledge, having arrived at the uneven end, is bound by the fetters and there he meets his doom. (9)

Page #96:
---------------------------
Jain Terms Preserved:

The deer, being ignorant, does not know its own benefit and harm through intellect, and continues to cause its own harm and loss. It goes to those uneven, high and low places where traps, snares etc. are laid. Its feet get entangled in the bondage and it gets destroyed, perishes.

Commentary - To illustrate the state that it attains, the author says - That deer is 'ahitātmā', i.e. one who does not do good for his own self, 'ahitaprajñānaḥ', i.e. one who has intellect that causes harm. Being such 'ahitaprajñāna', it goes to the uneven place having traps, snares etc. and if it falls there, it gets bound by those traps etc. and attains various states of misery and calamity. In that bondage, it meets its destruction, i.e. death.

Thus, there are some Śramaṇas (ascetics) who are 'mithyādṛṣṭi' (of wrong belief), 'anārya' (devoid of noble qualities), who doubt and fear in the observances where there should be no doubt, and do not doubt in those which are doubtful and fearsome.

Commentary - Having illustrated with the example, the author himself explains the purport - Just as the deer, being enveloped in ignorance, attains various calamities, similarly, some Śramaṇas, being of particular heretical beliefs, are 'mithyādṛṣṭi', i.e. of perverted view, and 'anārya', i.e. devoid of noble qualities. They doubt and fear in the observances which are not to be doubted, and do not doubt in those which are doubtful and fearsome, like the deluded deer.

The Right to Speak at the Appropriate Time
Many types of misfortunes, sufferings, and pains are obtained. Here, the word 'you' used in the verse is conceptual. The ascetics (Śramaṇa) are of what kind, the author gives this direction, whose vision is contrary to right faith or true faith - they are called Mithyādṛṣṭi (those with false beliefs). The advocates of ignorance and fatalism are Mithyādṛṣṭi.
Those persons who remain far from all the detestable or renunciable dharmas (qualities) are called Ārya. Those who are not Ārya are called Anārya, i.e., those who, being covered by ignorance, remain engaged in inauspicious, unreal conduct. Those who were discussed earlier also fall into this category of Anārya among other philosophical schools. The scriptural author (Āgamakāra) indicates that those persons who are engrossed in other philosophical schools are covered by ignorance, they are such that doubt should not be raised about them, who are not worthy of doubt, in this way, in the best religious observances and activities, they remain doubtful, and what is worthy of doubt, they are endowed with traps, snares, etc. From the perspective of the ignorant person, those who are endowed with principles contrary to absolutism. In such places, they go without doubt, they are like deer lacking in discrimination, ignorant. They commit acts of violence, etc., the fruit of which is inauspicious.

The shadow of the exposition of the Dharma, that they doubt, the foolish ones. They do not doubt the violent acts, the unmanifest, the unwise.

Translation:
Those other philosophers - who believe in philosophical systems other than Jainism, who are devoid of knowledge, lacking in discrimination, and empty of scriptural knowledge - they remain doubtful about the true exposition of Dharma, the true principles. But they do not doubt the violent acts, being unmanifest and unwise.

English translation with Jain terms preserved:

The Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra. Sarvapragam viukkassam, sarvam numam vihuniya.
Appattiyam akammanase, eyamattum mige chue. ॥12॥

Meaning - The karmas of the soul are destroyed and cut off only when it renounces greed, ego, deceit, fraud and hypocrisy. But the ignorant being, like the deer in the example, does not know the reality, and therefore does not renounce anger etc.

Commentary - They, the ignorant persons who are enveloped in ignorance, do not attain that which they should attain. The author explains this by saying - "Sarvapragam" means the greed which is present everywhere, that greed should be renounced. Similarly, the diverse kinds of pride or arrogance called "vyutkarsha" should be renounced, and also the "numam" i.e. deceit, fraud and hypocrisy should be renounced. By renouncing the passions, the renunciation of the deluding karmas is also implied. And due to the absence of karmas, he becomes "akarmansa" i.e. devoid of karmas. This state of being devoid of karmas is attained through specific knowledge, not through ignorance. Therefore, the author says that the ignorant being, like the deer, "tyajet" i.e. abandons or falls away from this state of being devoid of karmas.

Ye eyam na abhijananti, micchadditthi anaria. Miga va pasabaddha te, ghaya mesanti nantaso. ॥13॥

Meaning - Those who do not know this, the false-believers, the non-Aryans, like the deer bound in a snare, will meet with destruction endlessly.

Translation with Jain terms preserved:

The Authority to Speak on One's Own Time
The ignorant opponents, who are of wrong belief (asammyadrishti), devoid of noble qualities (arya-gunas), do not truly understand this meaning or fact. Like a deer caught in a snare, they repeatedly experience birth and death - they come and go in the cycle of birth and death.

Commentary
Further, the author expounds on the defects of the ignorant proponents:
Those who have taken refuge in the doctrine of ignorance (ajnana-paksha), who do not know the means of destruction of karmas (karmakshapaṇopāya) - the spiritual practice for the annihilation of karmas, who are obsessed with their own false beliefs (asadgraha-gasta), who are of wrong belief (mithyadrishti), devoid of noble qualities (aryya), they, like a deer bound by a snare, will repeatedly experience destruction and annihilation, or will seek it, because of their inability to perform the appropriate spiritual activities, continuously and without interruption. Thus are the ignorant proponents.

Verse
Some Brahmanas and some Shramanas, all proclaim their own knowledge. But the beings in the entire world do not know anything.

Commentary
Now, the author wishes to expose the fallacy in the stance of the ignorant proponents. Some specific Brahmanas (belonging to the Brahmanical tradition) and some Shramanas (ascetics) - all of them proclaim their own particular knowledge. They expound their own knowledge as if it is unique and superior. They believe that the entire world of living beings (sarvaloke'pi pranah) do not know anything at all.

Page #100:
---------------------------
English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra states that since it is not based on facts, the knowledge it presents is not true. Therefore, ignorance is better than such knowledge, as the conception of knowledge is not required - it is unnecessary. The Sutrakara further clarifies that all the beings in the entire world do not know the complete truth or reality accurately.

Milakkhu abhilakkhussa, jaha vuttanubasae.
Na heum se vijanaai, bhasitam t'anubasae. (15)

Translation: A Mleccha (barbarian), who is disconnected from and devoid of culture or etiquette, translates or recites the speech of an Amleccha (noble or Arya) person. However, he does not know the reason or purpose behind what is spoken, and merely recites or repeats the words.

Tika (Commentary): Even though their knowledge has come down through the lineage of their teachers, since it is rootless, it is not true. The author illustrates this through an example - just as a Mleccha who is unacquainted with the Arya language, merely recites or translates the speech of an Amleccha (Arya) who is unfamiliar with the Mleccha language, without properly understanding the intended meaning or purpose behind the speech. Similarly, the Mleccha does not definitively know the reason or basis for which the Arya person used that particular language, and merely follows the words without the true comprehension.

Evam-annania-nanam, vayantavi sayam-sayam.
Nicchayattham na jananti, milakkhuva abo-hiya. (16)

Translation: Similarly, those who are ignorant speak of knowledge, each in their own way. But they do not know the true essence or certainty, being like ignorant Mlecchas.

The translation is as follows:

The right to speak on one's own matter
The translation and commentary show that the Brahmin and Shramana traditions, who are devoid of true knowledge, expound their own knowledge, but they do not know the definite meaning. They are similarly devoid of understanding - devoid of knowledge. Just as an mleccha (barbarian) who lacks knowledge of the Arya language can only translate the Arya language without understanding its true meaning, similarly the ignorant Shramanas and Brahmanas, though speaking, do not know the definite meaning due to contradictory speech claiming their own knowledge as authoritative. Thus, they determine their own Tirthankaras as omniscient and act according to their teachings, but the intention of the omniscient cannot be grasped by the limited vision, as it is said "the non-omniscient cannot know the omniscient." 
Similarly, due to the inscrutability of the mental tendencies of others, the teacher also, due to the impossibility of grasping the intended meaning as it actually is, only expresses the unexplained, like the mlecchas, being devoid of understanding. Therefore, ignorance itself is the best. Thus, the greater the acceptance of knowledge, the greater the possibility of grave faults. For example, he who touches someone's head with his foot commits a great offense, while he who touches without using the limbs does not offend. Thus, ignorance itself experiences the main state, not knowledge.

---------------------------
Shri Sutrakritanga Sutram

The more the knowledge increases, the more the gravity of the faults also increases. In other words, if a Jnani (enlightened being) commits any fault, it is considered grave. If a person knowingly touches the head of another person with his foot - places his foot on their head, then this act is considered a grave offense. On the other hand, if due to ignorance or by mistake, one's foot touches the head of another person, then this act is not considered a fault due to the ignorance. Therefore, ignorance is the main basis of life, not knowledge, say the proponents of ignorance.

"The examination of the ignorant, does not determine in ignorance. One's own self is not capable of instructing another, how then can one instruct others?" (Sutrakritanga 17)

Commentary: The author now refutes the doctrine of the advocates of ignorance. They claim that ignorance itself is the highest good. This justification in favor of ignorance is not logically proven. These advocates of ignorance are themselves incapable of convincing or satisfying themselves with their own doctrine, so how can they instruct others?

Further, even if it is said that due to the difficulty in understanding the mental states of others, ignorance is the best, this too is invalid, because they themselves, by advocating the superiority of ignorance, are acknowledging the knowledge of others' mental states.

Page #103:
---------------------------
Swasama vaktatvatadhikarah their definite form present to wish, in fact their that analytical analysis is not proved reasonable. Whether a certain knowledge is true or it is false. Their such critical thinking and ignorance itself is the best, such a consideration and as knowledge increases, so the defect also increases, it is not appropriate to believe because the critical thinking that is done in this way is also cognitive, on the basis of which that thinking progresses. In such a situation, the ignorant cannot even solve themselves from the ignorance which they consider the best. So when they themselves cannot solve, undoubtedly they are ignorant, then those who want to get knowledge from them, want to get theoretical education, how can they teach them - can solve their problem. As it has been said - they themselves are unsettled - without solution. It has also been said by the ignorant that all the teachings, theoretical education etc. are as groundless as the translation-following or recitation of Arya language by a mleccha, this is unreasonable because even the translation of someone else's language cannot be done without knowledge. The ignorant has also said that it is difficult-impossible to know the mental state of another. Therefore, the statement that ignorance itself is the best is also devoid of logic and reason, because when you say that ignorance itself is the best, you have to accept that you have the knowledge of the mental state of others, when you are inclined to teach others the doctrine of ignorance. If the mental state of others cannot be known, then how can your students who want to get knowledge-teaching from you, know your mental state, how can they assimilate your thoughts and thinking. Then why do you teach them the principles of ignorance. Other thinkers or philosophers also accept that the mental state of another can be known, understood, this is a clear example - the inner mind can be understood from the shape of a person, from the gesture, from the movement, from the action-activity, from the speech, from the changes or changes in the eyes, mouth etc.

In the forest, the foolish creature, the foolish follower.
Both these are ignorant, they suffer intense sorrow.

Commentary - In this way, those ascetics who are ignorant, are not capable of teaching themselves and others properly, so he illustrates it through an example -
Just as a certain foolish creature in the forest, who is unable to determine the direction, when such a one goes, and another foolish creature follows him, then both of them, being ignorant, suffer intense, unbearable sorrow.

The Sutra Kritanga Sutra.  Those who have attained the path by conviction, due to their ignorance, are like those who are ignorant of their own path and consider it to be the right path, while considering the path of others to be wrong. They are themselves deluded and delude others. ||18||
_Commentary - The ignorant cannot convince themselves or others about their own doctrines. The author of the Agamas illustrates this point with an example -
Just as a foolish, lost creature in the forest is unable to know the directions and follows another lost creature, both of them, not being wise or clever in knowing the path well, suffer intense unbearable pain or get lost in the dense forest because they are covered with ignorance, their knowledge is not uncovered. Similarly, those ignorant people who consider their own path - their own theoretical beliefs - to be the right and good truth and the path of others - their doctrines - to be wrong and untrue, are themselves deluded - possessed by delusion - and make others deluded.

Swasama Vaktavyataadhikarah

Translation:

The authority to speak on one's own time

Translation - Some of the other philosophical thinkers mentioned earlier say that the goal of our life is moksha (liberation). We worship the true dharma (righteous path). However, as they say, they do not act accordingly, but act in the opposite manner. They move towards adharma (unrighteousness). The path of samyama (restraint) is very simple and straightforward, but they do not go in that direction - they do not practice samyama.

Commentary - And in order to demonstrate the exemplary case, the author says - "Thus" in the demonstration of the previously stated meaning, some who are deluded in their feelings, and blind in their perception, such as the Ajivikas, etc., consider 'niyaya' or 'niyaga' as moksha or true dharma, and they are the seekers of that. They, indeed, claiming that "we are the worshippers of true dharma", being eager for renunciation, engaged in the activities of harming the living beings of the earth, water and vegetation, such as cooking and getting others to cook, etc. And they themselves do not follow it, and they instruct others, whereby they fall from the intended goal of attaining moksha. Or, even if the attainment of moksha is not possible, still, by engaging in such unrighteous acts, they would incur sins. This is indicated by the arising of the notion of impurity. And further, these Ajivikas and others, who are followers of the Goshalaka doctrine, engaged in the path of ignorance, do not at all go or attain the straight, excellent, intended path of moksha or true dharma, which is completely straight. If the completely straight is true, then these blind due to ignorance, who are deluded in their knowledge, would not say so. And these ignorant ones are of sixty-seven divisions, and these divisions are to be demonstrated by this method, that is, the nine categories (of the Jain philosophy) - the living, the non-living, the existent, the non-existent, the indescribable, the existent-indescribable, the non-existent-indescribable - by these seven modes, they cannot be known, nor is there any purpose in knowing them, and this is the contemplation - who knows the living as existent? What is known by that? Who knows the living as non-existent? What is known by that? Similarly, in the case of the non-living and others, there are seven alternatives for each, the sixty-three modes. And some others insert four (alternatives) in the sixty-three, that is, who knows the origination of the existent? What is known by that? Similarly, who knows the origination of the non-existent, the existent-non-existent? What is known by that? The remaining three alternatives are not possible here, as they depend on the parts of the object. Thus, by the insertion of this tetrad, it becomes sixty-seven. Therein, the meaning of "who knows the living as existent" is that there is no specific knowledge of anyone who would experience the transcendental living beings, nor is there any fruit obtained by that knowledge, because if (the living being) is eternal, all-pervading, formless, endowed with the qualities of knowledge, etc., or distinct from these qualities, then what is the achievement of the human goal from that? Therefore, ignorance itself is the best.

Page #106:
---------------------------
In this verse of the Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra, the word 'Aavaje' - 'Aapadyeran' appears. It is in the Linga Lakar, signifying possibility. Through this, the Agamkar indicates that another type of adverse consequence is possible for those who follow the Ajivika doctrine. This means they do not attain their desired or intended goal. Instead, they experience the opposite, a sinful, adverse consequence. Thus, those who practice falsehood, who advocate ignorance as the path to liberation, and who believe in the determinism of Goshalak, like the Ajivikas, cannot attain the path of restraint. They cannot follow the true Dharma, nor can they strive towards the path of liberation, which is completely straightforward. 

Alternatively, this should be understood as follows: those who are devoid of inner light due to ignorance, who are blind, who declare knowledge to be false or untrue, cannot embrace truth, cannot mold their lives according to it, which is the most direct path to attaining liberation. These ignorant people consider ignorance to be the path to liberation or welfare. Their 67 divisions have been mentioned. These divisions should be understood as follows: Sat, Asat, Sad-Asat, Avaktvy, Sad-Avaktvy, Asad-Avaktvy, Sad-Asad-Avaktvy. 

Living beings and other substances cannot be known through these alternatives, and knowing them does not serve any purpose. Their association should be made as follows: who knows that the living being is Sat? What is the benefit of knowing that? What is the outcome? Who knows that the living being is Asat? What is the purpose of knowing that? Similarly, the alternatives of Sad-Asad, etc., should also be associated with the living being. Similarly, in the case of non-living beings, etc., these alternatives should be associated with each one. 

Two Navas + seven make 63 divisions of ignorance. Four more divisions should be added to these 63 divisions: (1) Who knows that the origin of feeling is from Sat existence? What is the purpose of knowing this? What is the result? (2) Who knows that the origin of feeling is from Asat? What is the purpose of knowing this? What is the outcome? (3) Who knows that the origin of feeling is from Sad-Asat? What is the result of knowing this? What is the outcome? (4) Who knows that the origin of feeling is from Avaktvy? What is the outcome of knowing this?

Of the seven alternatives mentioned above, four have been stated here in relation to the origin of feeling. The other three alternatives have not been discussed because they apply to the components after the substance has come into existence. This is not possible in the case of the origin of feelings.

Of the seven alternatives mentioned above, "Who knows that the living being is Sat?" is the first alternative. This means that no being in the world has such specific knowledge. It is impossible to know such beings and other substances that are beyond the senses, which cannot be perceived by the senses. Knowing them does not serve any purpose because whether the living being is eternal, omnipresent, formless, and free from qualities like knowledge, or the opposite, it does not serve any purpose or meaning. Therefore, ignorance is truly beneficial and conducive to welfare.

The right to speak on one's own time

And their own speech, this foolish one considers it right.

Translation:

The explanation: Those whose intellect is impure, who lack the quality of grasping the true reality, who do not approach the knowledgeable ones due to the previously mentioned alternatives, do not benefit from their proximity, and accept ignorance itself as the simple path to liberation, due to those alternatives.

Page #108:
---------------------------
Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra:

Just as a bird confined in a cage cannot break free from the cage, in the same way, they (the ignorant ones) cannot break free from the bondage of karmas.

Commentary: The proponents of knowledge (Jnanavadi) clearly state that the doctrine of the ignorant ones (Ajnanavadi) is meaningless. In accordance with the aforementioned logic and through their own conjectures, the ignorant ones establish and propound their principles. However, they are unskilled and incompetent in understanding the dharma of peace, forgiveness, and other virtues, as well as the sin of harming living beings. They are unable to sever the bondage of karmas, which are the cause of misery and unpleasant experiences, due to their falsehood and delusion.

It is absolutely certain that they are incapable of breaking free from the bondage of karmas. The author illustrates this with an example - just as a bird confined in a cage cannot break free from the cage's bondage and liberate itself, in the same way, the ignorant ones are unable to free themselves from the cycle of birth and death or transmigration.

Verse 23:
Praising their own doctrines and criticizing the words of others,
Those who are learned in that (doctrine) are liberated from the cycle of transmigration.

Commentary: The adherents of other philosophical systems (Anyatirthika-Jainetara Siddhantavadi) praise and justify their own established doctrines, and criticize and condemn the words or doctrines of others. In doing so, they display their own erudition and scholarship. They are deeply entangled and bound in the strong fetters of the cycle of transmigration.

Page #109:
---------------------------
The translation preserving the Jain terms is as follows:

Now the Aagamakara (scriptural author) generally propounds the doctrines of all those who believe in Ekantavada (absolutism) as being defective -
The persons who believe in other philosophical systems praise, describe and support their own philosophies, and criticize, condemn and denigrate the statements and views of others.
For example, the followers of the Samkhya philosophy criticize the Buddhists who believe in the origination, production and dissolution of all substances. Similarly, the Buddhists also criticize the Samkhyavadins. They say that what is eternal cannot perform any activity, nor can it do so successively or simultaneously. In the same way, other philosophers also behave, it should be understood.
The word 'tu' (but) used here indicates distinction and different order. These different philosophers praise their own philosophies and censure, condemn or denigrate the arguments of others. While doing so, they behave like scholars harboring mutual animosity. They propound specific arguments in support of their theoretical standpoints. In doing so, these theorists get deeply entangled in various ways in this world of four-fold destiny (Chaturgatimaya Samsara) which is full of diverse and strong bondages. They keep revolving in this Samsara forever.

Ahavaram purakkhayam kiriya vaidarisanam |
Kammachintapanatthanam samsarassa pavaddhanam || 24 ||

Translation - There is also another previously proclaimed doctrine of the Kriyavadins (ritualists). The contemplation on karma (karmic activity) is neglected or ignored by them. Their view leads to the perpetuation of the cycle of Samsara (transmigration).

The commentary explains that the Aagamakara is now presenting another philosophical view, that of the Kriyavadins, after dealing with the views of those who believe in Ekantavada. The Kriyavadins consider ritual activity as the primary means of liberation, but they have neglected the contemplation on karma. Therefore, their doctrine leads to the continuation of the cycle of Samsara.

Page #110:
---------------------------
Here is the English translation, preserving the Jain terms:

The word 'Atha' appearing in the Gatha of the Shri Sutrakritanga Sutram indicates continuity or immediacy. This is the second Darsana (philosophical view) of the Kriyavadins, which was mentioned earlier, after the view of the Ajnanavadins. Those who declare Chaitya-karma (worship of the Jina) and other related activities as the primary means for attaining Moksha (liberation) are known as the Kriyavadins. The Agamakaras (scriptural authors) raise the question - what kind of Kriyavadins are they? They say that contemplation, reflection, etc. regarding Karmas like Jnanavaranaiya (knowledge-obscuring) are called Karma-chinta (concern about Karmas). Those whose Karma-chinta has been destroyed, i.e., those who do not attain the right knowledge of Karmas like Jnanavaranaiya and perform actions arbitrarily, are called Karma-chinta-pranashta (those whose concern about Karmas has been destroyed). The Buddhist Shramanas and others, without the knowledge of Abhijnana (higher knowledge), do not consider the four types of Karmas performed without proper collection and accumulation as bondage-causing, and therefore, they are Karma-chinta-pranashta. Their view increases the series of sorrowful experiences or the unpleasant Asatodaya (inauspicious) suffering. In some places, the reading 'Samsaravardhanam' is found, which means that those Bhikshus (monks) who do not consider the four types of Karmas as bondage-causing increase the cycle of birth and death or Samsara.

The verse 25 states:
Janaṃ kāyeṇāṇakuṭṭī, abuho yaṃ ca hiṃsati |
Puṭṭho saṃveyaī paraṃ aviyattaṃ khu sāvajjaṃ || 25 ||

Translation: The one who, knowing, does not harm with the body, but harms with the mind, and the one who, not knowing, harms with the body but not with the mind, both commit only subtle, imperceptible sin.

The commentary explains that the one who, knowing, does not physically harm living beings but harms them mentally due to anger, does not accumulate Karma, as he is not engaged in physical activities like cutting or breaking the limbs of living beings. Similarly, the one who, not knowing, harms living beings physically but not mentally, also does not accumulate Karma. Thus, both types of actions, even though different, are subtle and imperceptible in terms of Karmic bondage.

Page #111:
---------------------------
The statement of the right time is: "The killing of a living being with the knowledge of its being a living being and with the intention to kill, and the action done in that way. The separation from life is caused by five kinds of violence." ||1||

It is said that karma is not accumulated by mere knowledge, etc. To show that there is some accumulation even in the subtle, the second half of the verse says, "Puththo". Thus, even by four kinds of karma, namely, knowledge-based, body-based, ignorance-based, and dream-like, one is slightly touched, and he experiences the result of that karma by mere touch, not by excessive ripening. This means that just as a lump of earth falling on a roof is immediately cleaned, so also the result is experienced immediately after the touch. Therefore, it is said that there is no decay of it, but not its complete absence. Thus, that which is subtle, indistinct, and not clearly experienced in the result, like the holding of a hoof, is subtle and exists with the fault. That is the karma based on knowledge, etc. ||25||

Commentary: The Āgama-kāra explains the statement that karma is free from mental anxiety, by saying:

A person who knows that he is killing a living being, but is not a killer by body, does not have the bondage of karma. The root "kuṭṭa" means piercing. The action of piercing is called ākuṭṭana or ākuṭṭa. The one who does it is called ākuṭṭī. The one who is not ākuṭṭī is called anākuṭṭī. Anākuṭṭī means non-violent or free from violence. This means that a person who kills a living being by mere mental action due to anger, etc., but does not pierce, cut, or destroy the limbs of the living being, does not have the accumulation or bondage of his evil karma. A person who is ignorant, does not have anger, etc., in his mind, and kills a living being by mere bodily action, does not have the accumulation or bondage of karma because there is no mental violence. The half part of this verse has already been said by the commentator in this regard, that the monks have this principle that four types of karma are not accumulated or bound. In this, the two divisions of knowledge-based and ignorance-based, which are done knowingly and unknowingly, are directly taken by the first half of the verse. And the remaining two divisions, namely, path-based and dream-like, are taken by the word "cha". The meaning of "īraṇa" or "īrya" is going. The path or way related to it is called "īrya-path". The karma that is bound by it is called "īrya-path" or "īrya-pathic". This means that while walking on the road, if a living being is killed unknowingly, karma is not bound. Dream-like karma is also not bound. According to common belief, dream is called "svapnānta". The one who is related to "svapnānta" is called "svapnānta". That "svapnānta" karma is also not binding. For example, if someone eats food in a dream, but in reality, he does not feel satisfied or his hunger is not satisfied. Similarly, karma is not bound by killing a living being in a dream. The question is raised, then how do those monks have karma bound? How do they believe in karma bondage? In this context, they say that if the one who is being killed is a living being, and the one who is killing, the killer, knows that he is a living being, and the killer has the thought that I am killing him, then if the killer tries to kill him with his body, and as a result of that effort, the living being is killed, then there is actually violence, and only then is there accumulation or bondage of karma.

## Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**If any one of these five factors is absent, then neither violence nor karmic bondage occurs. There are thirty-two variations of these five factors. The person who commits the first variation is violent, while the remaining thirty-one variations do not involve violence.**

**It is said that violence arises from these five factors: the living being, the knowledge of the living being's existence, the mental state of the killer, the killer's action, and the separation of the victim's life.**

**The question arises: Does an action performed with knowledge (Parijnopacita-jnana) not lead to karmic accumulation or bondage?**

**It is said that the karma that binds from these actions is in an unmanifest form, very subtle or very ordinary. To illustrate this, the Agamkar explains in the latter part of the verse that a person who acts with four types of karma - mental activity (Parijnopacita karma), physical action without knowledge (Avijnopacita karma), actions related to the path of life (Iryapathika karma), and actions in dreams (Swapnanatika karma) - binds karma in a subtle form.**

**Therefore, he is called the doer of those actions, and he experiences the fruit or result of those actions only in a subtle way, because he does not experience them in a full-fledged manner.**

**An example is given: Just as a handful of sand thrown at a wall touches the wall and then scatters, similarly, the above four types of karma are destroyed after a subtle touch. Therefore, due to being touched only subtly, it is said that there is no accumulation of those karmas, but it is not said that they are completely absent.**

**Thus, it can be said that these four karmas are unmanifest, unexpressed, and subtle. The word "khu" used here is conceptual. Therefore, the above four types of karma are unmanifest because their fruit or result is not clearly experienced.**

**Therefore, Avijnopacita and other karmas are sinful in an unmanifest form.**

**Verse 26:**

**There are three causes (Aayana) that lead to sin: attacking a living being directly, sending someone to kill it, and mentally approving of its killing.**

**Translation:**

**There are three causes (Aayana) that lead to sin: attacking a living being directly (Abhikram), sending someone to kill it (Presya), and mentally approving of its killing (Manasa Anujanya).**

**Commentary:**

**It is asked: If the four types of karma mentioned above do not lead to accumulation, then how does karmic accumulation occur? To answer this doubt, it is said that there are three causes (Aayana) that lead to sin. These are: attacking a living being directly (Abhikram), sending someone to kill it (Presya), and mentally approving of its killing (Manasa Anujanya).**

**The first cause (Abhikram) is when a person directly attacks a living being with the intention of killing it. The second cause (Presya) is when a person sends someone to kill a living being. The third cause (Manasa Anujanya) is when a person mentally approves of the killing of a living being.**

**These three causes are the root of sin. They are the actions that lead to the accumulation of negative karma.**

Page #113:
---------------------------
##  Self-Time Statement of Authority

**Karma-Adana, the difference from Parijnopchita:**  Here, only mental contemplation is involved, while the other (Parijnopchita) involves approval of the killing of a living being by another. || 26 ||

**Commentary:**  The question arises regarding the previously mentioned four types of karma, that if they are not accumulated, then how does karma accumulate?  The Agamkar (Jain scripture) explains the view of those who hold this opinion:

- There are three Adanas (causes).  The origin of Adana is as follows:  Those by which karma is taken or accepted are called Adana.  The Agamkar, pointing this out, says that the Adanas (causes) by which sinful or impure, low or inauspicious karma is done are as follows:

- **First Adana:**  To kill a being oneself with the intention of killing it.

- **Second Adana:**  To have someone else kill a being on your behalf.

- **Third Adana:**  To mentally approve of the killing of a being by another.

The difference between this and Parijnopchita karma is that in Parijnopchita, there is only mental contemplation of killing, while here, approval is given in the context of another killing a being.

**These are the three Adanas:**

**Thus, whoever abandons these three, becomes free from attachment and attains Nirvana.** || 27 ||

**Commentary:**  These three Adanas are the causes by which sin is committed.  Thus, by being free from attachment, one attains Nirvana.

**Om Om Om**

**Translation:**  There are three Adanas (causes) of karma-bondage, by which sinful karma, inauspicious karma, is bound.  Where these three are not present, there is purity of thought, and there is no bondage of karma, but rather Nirvana or liberation is attained.

**Commentary:**  Thus, where there is self-action, causing action, and approval of the killing of a living being, there is accumulation of karma due to the afflicted determination of the killing of a living being.  The Agamkar says that this is the only place where karma accumulates, not elsewhere.

**Further Explanation:**  These three previously mentioned Adanas, either individually or collectively, are the causes by which sinful karma is accumulated due to the afflicted determination.  Thus, where there is no self-action, causing action, or approval of the killing of a living being, there is no accumulation of karma for one who is free from attachment, with a mind free from hatred, even if there is killing of a living being.  This is because there is no mental intention, either through the body or the mind, and with pure consciousness, there is no accumulation of karma.  Due to the absence of karma, Nirvana, the state of cessation of all duality, is attained. || 27 ||

**Commentary:**  In the context of the killing of living beings, there are three options: to do it oneself, to have someone else do it, and to approve of it being done.  These are the causes.  When these are taken, and the killing of a living being is done with an afflicted determination, full of anger and other afflictions, then karma is accumulated.  Karma is not accumulated elsewhere.  The Agamkar says this to show this.

## Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra - Here the word 'tu' is used in the sense of 'concept'. Therefore, it means that the three causes of karma-bandha mentioned earlier are the cause of karma-bandha in a separate and combined form. When there is a connection with evil-defective, malicious determination-effort, undertaking, then by these causes, the bondage of sinful karma takes place. Where the three conditions of killing, causing, and approving are not present, where there is no tendency motivated by attachment, aversion, etc., even if violence occurs only with the mind or with the body, or with the mind and body devoid of internal evil intentions, then due to the purity of emotions, the karma-jiva becomes free from all kinds of dualities - obstacles and troubles - and attains liberation.

**Verse 28:**
A father, driven by a terrible calamity, may kill his son and eat his flesh to save his own life, but even doing so, he does not become bound by karma. Similarly, a wise sage, free from attachment and aversion, even if he eats meat, does not become bound by karma.

**Commentary:**
The text explains that karma-bandha does not occur for one who acts with pure intentions. It gives an example: A householder father, driven by a terrible calamity, may kill his son and eat his flesh to save his own life. Even though he is driven by attachment and aversion, he does not become bound by karma. Similarly, a wise sage, free from attachment and aversion, even if he eats meat, does not become bound by karma. The word 'cha' here is used in the sense of 'api'. The essence is that whether a householder or a monk, whoever has pure intentions, does not become bound by karma even if he eats meat.

**Verse 29:**
Those who are pure in mind, their minds do not waver. They are free from impurities, and they are not bound by karma.

Page #115:
---------------------------
"The statement of those who hold other views is this: those who harbor hatred in their minds towards any living beings, their minds are not pure, free from impurities and faults. Their assertion that there is no sin in harboring hatred in the mind is false and untrue. They are not those who follow the path of restraint."

"Commentary: The author now refutes this claim. Those who harbor hatred in their minds, their intention is to kill, therefore their minds are not pure. Their claim that there is no sin in merely harboring hatred is false, because they are not those who follow the path of restraint, as their minds are impure. The mind is the primary cause of karmic accumulation, as even they have stated that there is no karmic accumulation in mere physical actions without the involvement of the mind. Therefore, whatever is the primary cause of something happening or not happening, that is the primary cause. It may be argued that even without physical actions, there is no cause. This is true, but it is also true that the mind is the primary cause, as it is said, "By purifying the mind, one attains liberation." It is also said, "The mind is the cause of samsara, filled with attachments and other afflictions. Is it possible to be liberated from this mind?" It is also said, "O mind, I bow to you, for even though you are equal to all, you are the cause of both good and bad. Some are destined for hell, while others are destined for heaven, depending on the good or bad karma they have accumulated." Thus, it is clear that the mind is the cause of karmic bondage. Even if one does not act on their thoughts, the mind is still impure, and this leads to karmic bondage. If one acts on their thoughts, then it is due to lack of mindfulness, and this also leads to karmic bondage. It is said, "Even in a dream, if the mind is impure, there is karmic bondage. This is also accepted by you, as you have said, "That which is unseen is impure." Thus, even a single impure thought leads to karmic bondage. Therefore, what you have said, "Knowledge of living beings," etc., is all false. What you have said, "Son, father, beginning," etc., is also not well-considered, because as long as there is no change in the mind, no one kills. And how can the mind be pure if it has changed? Karmic bondage is inevitable when the mind is impure. This is the contradiction here. What you have said, "Eating the flesh of another who has been killed by another, or being burned by a hot coal that has been picked up by another, does not have any karmic consequences," is like the ramblings of a madman, and should not be listened to. Because, even if one eats the flesh of another who has been killed by another, they are still consenting to it, and this leads to karmic bondage. It is also said, "Those who consent, those who kill, those who buy and sell, those who process, those who consume, and those who kill, are all eight types of killers." The three types of consent, which you have mentioned, are nothing but the enjoyment of the fruits of the actions of others. Thus, those who claim that there is no karmic accumulation in these four types of actions, are ignorant of karma. This is a well-established principle."

Page #116:
---------------------------
The statement that there is no karma accumulation or bondage from hating someone solely through the mind is false. Their mind is impure, lacking religious purity and sanctity, which is why they do not follow the path of restraint. In reality, the mind is the primary cause of karma bondage. Therefore, the early Jains have also stated that karma is not accumulated or bound solely through physical actions without mental activity, thought, or intention. Thus, the primary cause is that which exists when something happens and does not exist when it does not. Just as karma is bound when there is a mind, when good or bad intentions arise in the mind, and karma is not accumulated when there is no mind. Therefore, the mind is the main cause of karma bondage.

A doubt arises: The previous proponents have stated that mental activity, thought, or intention alone, without physical action or effort, is not the cause of karma bondage. Why do you say that the mind is the main cause of karma bondage? They also consider the mind to be the primary cause of karma accumulation.

In response, the Agamas say: Although you, the aforementioned proponents, have said this, your statement is not logical. For you have said that liberation is attained through the purity of the mind. In saying this, you have declared the mind to be the primary cause of liberation. You have also said that the mind that is contaminated with attachments, aversions, and other defilements is the cause of worldly existence, the cause of wandering in the world. If that mind becomes free from attachment, aversion, etc., it is called the end of the world, meaning it is liberated from worldly bonds and attains liberation. Other philosophers have also said: O Mind, I bow to you, although all beings are equal, you become transformed into the good aspects of some and the bad aspects of others. This is why some beings walk the path leading to the city of hell, while others, through their own inherent power, pierce the solar system and attain liberation. Thus, according to your principles, it is proven that contaminated mental activity, mental intentions with bad consequences, are the cause of karma bondage.

Even in the path of walking, if a person walks without proper use, they accumulate karma. This is because not using properly is a mental defilement. If that person walks with proper use, they do not accumulate karma, because they are not negligent in their walking. It is said that when a person who is mindful of their walking lifts their foot to place it on the earth, if a subtle being is killed under their foot, that person does not incur even a slight amount of sin. This is because that person is free from sin due to being mindful of the protection of all beings.

Even in the dream state, due to the purity of the mind, there is some karma bondage. You have also acknowledged that in the dream state, there is subtle, indistinct sin. Thus, karma bondage arises from mental activity that is full of defilement. You have said this. The discussion of beings, knowledge of beings, etc., is all illogical. Your statement that when a father eats the flesh of his son in times of great distress, free from attachment and aversion, he does not incur karma bondage, is also devoid of true contemplation. Because, "I kill," until this intention arises in the mind, no one is inclined to kill. Consider this: Is the mental intention, "I kill," not contaminated? Does it not indicate a contaminated mental state?

Self-time statement authority. Huh? Certainly, mental afflictions or complexities bind karma. In this regard, your and our views are in agreement. Therefore, it is inappropriate to declare the son-slayer father as sinless.

What the speaker stated elsewhere, that a hand does not burn from embers taken by another person's hand, similarly, the sin of karma does not bind from the consumption of animal flesh by another person - this statement is also like the ramblings or nonsense of a madman - not worth listening to. The reality is that even when consuming the flesh of an animal slaughtered by another person, the eater's approval is certainly involved. When approval is present, the binding of karma is necessary. Other philosophers also establish that the one who approves of killing an animal, who cuts and separates the animal's limbs, who takes the animal to the place where it is to be killed, who buys or sells the animal for slaughter, who cooks the animal's flesh, who eats that flesh - these eight individuals are violent, who are stained with sin from the killing of the animal. The aforementioned thinkers have established that the sin of killing an animal, causing it to be killed by another, and approving of it - the sin that occurs in these is a sign of their partial tasting - sampling - of the principles of the Vitaraga Lord. Therefore, those other philosophers who declare that four types of karma are not accumulated, do not bind, are devoid of the concern of karma - the subtle contemplation of the karmic process.

This is the view, the merchants of the seven treasures.
They take refuge, believing thus, and serve the fire. ||30||
Shadow - With these views, relying on the seven treasures.
Believing it to be refuge, people serve the evil. ||
Translation - Those thinkers who are engrossed in enjoying pleasures and fame, glory, prestige, etc., based on these views or principles accepted by them.
_Commentary - Now, to show the series of misfortunes of these action-oriented thinkers, he says - With these aforementioned views, that four types of karma do not accumulate, they, the thinkers, rely on the seven treasures, are attached to ease, do whatever they can, eat whatever they can get, and believe that this, their own philosophy, is the refuge capable of rescuing them from the world. Believing thus, they serve, do, the evil, the wrong, even though they are virtuous people, like ordinary people. ||30||
Commentary - The author of the scripture, revealing the futile, fruitless views of these action-oriented thinkers, says
Four types of karma are not accumulated - do not bind. Those other philosophers who follow this principle, while being attached to enjoyment and prestige, do everything. They do not pay attention to what is right and wrong. They eat whatever is available. They do not pay any attention to what is desirable and undesirable, etc. They believe that their philosophy - the principles accepted by them - are the ones that will rescue them from the ocean of the world.

। Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra । With such a belief, they perform rituals contrary to the right faith, thus they consume sinful karma - they are bound by sin, they are thus like ordinary humans, even though they are vow-takers, according to their perspective and even though they follow the so-called vows.

Commentary Meaning - To explain this meaning, the Agamkar explains through an example - A boat in which water is leaking from all sides is called an Asraavini boat. Asraavini means full of holes. A blind man from birth, boarding such a boat, wants to cross the river, but because the boat is leaky, water keeps coming in, the boat becomes full of water and the man drowns in the middle of the water - he drowns and dies.

## The Right Time Statement of Authority

Those who desire liberation from the cycle of birth and death, even though they are in the world, do not understand the four types of karma and therefore, due to their incompetence, they continue to wander in the cycle of transmigration, which is the form of the four realms of existence. They experience the suffering of birth, old age, death, and misery for an infinite period of time and do not attain the desired happiness of liberation. This is what I say, as before. ||32||

This is the second chapter of the *Samaya* section of the *Sutrakritanga* Sutra.
›
Completed.
- To connect this parable with the principle to be discussed, the *Agam* authors say that just as a blind man, riding on a boat with holes, wants to cross the river but is unable to do so, similarly, those whose views are contrary to the true reality, *asamyak* or *mithya*, who support meat-eating, such un-Aryan, devoid of Aryan qualities, and those who are forbidden from good conduct and behavior, such Buddhist monks, remain attached to their beliefs and desire to cross the world, to be free from birth and death and attain the happiness of liberation. But as mentioned earlier, their views do not accept the four types of karma-bondage. Due to this, they are unable to cross the world and escape the cycle of transmigration. They wander in the world, which is filled with the four realms of existence. They repeatedly experience birth, old age, death, and misery in this world, and continue to wander in the world for an infinite period of time. They cannot attain the desired happiness of liberation. This is what I say, and it should be understood as before.

## The Sutra of the Sutra-Creator (Sutra-Kritanga Sutra)
### Third Uddesaka (Section)

**Whatever is tainted, even a single particle of food, is intended for the devotees who come.**
**He who eats it, even if it is a thousand yojanas away, serves both sides.** (1)

**Commentary:**

This is the third Uddesaka of the first Adhyayana (Chapter). It follows the second Uddesaka. Its connection to the previous Uddesaka is this: the subject matter of the first Adhyayana is to present the principles of our own time (Jainism) and the principles of other times (other philosophies). The first two Uddesakas have already presented the principles of our own time and other times. This Uddesaka also does the same.

Alternatively, the first two Uddesakas have presented the faults of other philosophies and their defects. This Uddesaka also presents the defects of their conduct.

This Uddesaka, with its four Anuyoga (applications), should be recited with the qualities of clarity and non-slippage. This is it:

This Uddesaka is also connected to the following Sutra. The following Sutra, up to the end of this Uddesaka, says, "Thus, some Shramanas..." and so on. This is also connected here. Some Shramanas eat whatever is tainted and wander through the world.

The following Sutra says, "Understand..." and so on. Whatever is tainted, one should understand.

Similarly, the connection with other Sutras should be established by looking at the context.

Now, the meaning of the Sutra is explained:

"Whatever" refers to any kind of food, whether it is small or large. "Tainted" means that it has been touched by an Adhakarma (action that creates karma) or something similar. "Intended for the devotees who come" means that it has been prepared by a devotee with faith for other devotees who come. "Even if it is a thousand yojanas away" means that even if the food is taken from a house that is a thousand yojanas away, he who eats it serves both sides, the side of the householder and the side of the monk.

This means that even if the food is prepared by someone else for other devotees, and even if it is a thousand yojanas away, he who eats it serves both sides. What then of those who prepare all their food themselves and eat it themselves? They are certainly serving both sides.

Alternatively, "both sides" could refer to the worldly path and the path of liberation. Or, it could refer to the previous bound states, such as the state of being a Nikaachita (one who has been expelled from the community), and the state of being a Karma-Prakriti (one who has a karmic nature).

The Agamas (Jain scriptures) say, "What kind of karmic bondage is created for a Shramana who eats food that is not his own? Gotama! Eight kinds of karmic bondage are created: loose bondage, tight bondage, bondage of action, bondage of speech, bondage of thought, bondage of anger, bondage of hatred, and bondage of greed."

Therefore, the Shramanas and other Tirthankaras, by eating food prepared by others, are serving both sides. This is the meaning of the Sutra. (1)

**Commentary on the Commentary:**

Now, the third Uddesaka of the first Adhyayana is begun.

The second Uddesaka has been explained. Now, the third Uddesaka is begun. Its connection to the previous Uddesaka is this: the subject matter of the first Adhyayana is to present the principles of our own time (Jainism) and the principles of other times (other philosophies).

## The Right Time for Speaking

The **svayam-samaya vaktvyata-adhikāra** has been explained. This section will also discuss the same, or it may be said that the previous two sections have presented the views of the **kudṛṣṭi-mithyādṛṣṭi** (those with wrong vision and false vision). Their faults have been shown. Now, in this section, their faults in conduct are being presented. In this regard, the four **anuyoga-dvāra** (gates of the anuyoga) of this section should be presented, and one should pronounce the seven sūtras (aphorisms) of the qualities of speaking without stumbling, not getting stuck, etc. That sūtra is as follows:

**Its meaning is as follows:**

This sūtra is connected to the previous sūtra. In the last sūtra of the previous section, it was said, "**evaṃ tu samaṇānge**" (thus, the monks). That statement is also relevant here. Therefore, its meaning is that any **śramaṇa** (monk) who consumes even a little **pūtikṛta** (impure, contaminated) food wanders in the world, gets lost. From the traditional sūtra, "**bujji-jja**" etc. has been said, which means that a person should attain **bodha** (knowledge). Therefore, the **śramaṇa** should be aware of the food that is slightly contaminated with **ādha-karma** (half-karma) etc. faults. He should gain accurate knowledge about it. This connection should be made here. Similarly, one should be aware of the connection of this sūtra with other sūtras. Now, the meaning of that sūtra is revealed:

What to say of food that is abundant in **ādha-karma** etc. faults, even food that is contaminated with a single particle of contaminated food, and which has been prepared by a devout householder in anticipation of the arrival of monks for alms? Even if he himself did not cook it, the **śramaṇa** who consumes such food, even if he keeps a distance of a thousand houses, consumes both the **sadhu** (holy) and the **gṛhastha** (householder) sides. The meaning is that any **śramaṇa** who consumes food that is even contaminated with a single particle of food prepared by a devout householder for visiting monks, even if he keeps a distance of a thousand houses, consumes both the **sadhu** and the **gṛhastha** sides. In such a situation, what to say of the **bhikṣu** (monks) of the **Bauddha** tradition and the **śramaṇa-tāpasa** (monks-ascetics) of other traditions? What can be said about them? They themselves prepare and consume the entire meal. They completely consume both the **sadhu** and the **gṛhastha** sides.

Or, the explanation of the **dvipada** (two-footed) can also be given as follows: **īryāpatha** (path of conduct) and **sāmprāyika** (conventional) are the two sides. Or, it can be understood as follows: The person who consumes the previously mentioned **pūtikṛta** (impure, contaminated) or **sadosa** (faulty) food first transforms the bound **karma-prakrti** (karmic tendencies) into **nikācita** (eliminated) etc. states, and then binds new **karma-prakrti** (karmic tendencies).

**1**

In the **āgama** (scripture), it is said about **ādha-karma** (half-karma) etc., which is as follows: "O **Bhagavan** (Lord)! How many **karma-prakrti** (karmic tendencies) does a **śramaṇa** bind when he consumes **ādha-karma** (half-karma) food?" This question was asked by **Gaṇadhara Gautama** to **Prabhu Mahāvīra**. **Bhagavan Mahāvīra** replied, "**Gautama**! That **śramaṇa** binds eight **karma-prakrti** (karmic tendencies). He transforms the **karma** (actions) bound in **śithila-bandhana** (loose bondage) into **saghana-bandhana** (strong bondage). He **caya** (accumulates) and **upacaya** (increases) **karma** (actions). He makes the **karma** (actions) that are **hrasva-sthiti** (short-lived) into **dīrgha-sthiti** (long-lived), i.e., he expands the **karma** (actions) whose duration is short. According to this, the **sānkhya-bhikṣu** (Sānkhya monks) etc. **paratīrthi** (those who belong to other religions) and **svayūthika-jana** (those who belong to their own group) who consume both the **sadhu** (holy) and the **gṛhastha** (householder) sides...

---------------------------
The Sutra of the Sri Sutra Kritanga: Those who do not know the nature of half-karma food, who are ignorant of the eight types of karma, and who are not knowledgeable about the four paths of existence, are like the Vaishalika fish who are distressed when the water recedes.  The Vaishalika fish are large fish who are caught in the shallows when the water recedes, and they are then eaten by birds and other animals.  Just as these fish are distressed, so too are those who do not know the nature of half-karma food.  They are caught in the cycle of birth and death, and they suffer greatly.

Commentary:  The author of this text uses the example of the Vaishalika fish to illustrate the suffering that comes from not understanding the nature of half-karma food.  The Vaishalika fish are large and strong, but they are helpless when the water recedes.  They are caught in the shallows and become easy prey for birds and other animals.  Similarly, those who do not understand the nature of half-karma food are caught in the cycle of birth and death.  They are unable to escape the suffering that comes from their actions, and they are constantly being reborn into new lives.  The author warns that those who do not understand the nature of half-karma food will suffer greatly.  They will be caught in the cycle of birth and death, and they will be unable to escape the suffering that comes from their actions.  Therefore, it is important to understand the nature of half-karma food and to avoid it.

Page #123:
---------------------------
Those who are attached to present pleasures wander in the ocean of misery. In this regard, the Agamkar presents an example: A large fish, called Visala, born in the ocean, with thick hair, belonging to a specific species or having a large body, is struck by the strong wind and waves when the waves rise in the ocean. It is driven by the high waves of water and comes to the river bank. When the water that came there dries up quickly after the waves recede, the fish remains stranded on the river bank due to its large size. It is torn apart by carnivorous animals like Dhak and Kank, and by humans who are greedy for flesh and fat. It has no protector or shelter. It dies in pain. Here, the word 'tu' means 'you'. Therefore, due to the lack of protection or a protector, it is destroyed. This is the meaning of these two verses.

And those Shramanas who are attached to present pleasures, like the Visala fish, will face destruction countless times in this world.

Commentary: The Agamkar, after presenting this example, explains its application to the present situation. Just as the Visala fish is destroyed, so too are the Sankhya, Pasupata, and other monks, or those who follow their own paths, destroyed. The Agamkar explains what kind of Shramanas they are: Those who consider the enjoyment of food, which is the result of their actions, as present pleasure, are attached to present pleasures. Just as the sea crow is attached to the momentary pleasure it receives, so too are the Sankhya, Pasupata, and other monks attached to momentary pleasures and enjoyments. They consume food without any thought, and as a result, they experience very severe suffering. Like the large-bodied fish mentioned earlier, they are destroyed. Just as the bucket of a well repeatedly dips and rises in the water, this cycle continues endlessly. Similarly, they wander in the ocean of samsara, never able to cross it.

- This is another kind of ignorance, which some people say is created by a god, while others say it is created by Brahma.
- This world is created by God, with the main elements and so on, according to others. It is full of living beings and non-living beings, and it is full of happiness and suffering.

## Self-Time Statement of Authority - Translation

**Others who hold different views say that this world is created by God. The Samkhya philosophers say that this world is created by Pradhana or Prakriti and others. This world is composed of Jiva, Ajīva, Sukha and Duhkha.**

**Commentary:**

Those who believe in God as the cause of the world say that this world is created by God. They provide evidence for their claim by saying that all this, including the body, the universe, the senses, etc., is accepted as Dharma (righteousness) because it is based on a wise cause. Dharma is achievable through intelligent reasoning and is based on the specific structure of things. For example, a pot, etc., is created by an intelligent cause because it has a specific structure. Similarly, temples, wells, etc., are also created by an intelligent cause because they have a specific structure. Similarly, the ocean, mountains, rivers, earth, body, etc., are also subject to debate because they have a specific structure. Therefore, they are created by an intelligent cause. The one who is the creator of this entire world cannot be an ordinary human being, but must be God. Similarly, the body, the universe, the senses, etc., are accepted as Dharma because they are based on a wise cause. Dharma is achievable through intelligent reasoning because it is a consequence, like a pot, etc. Similarly, it is active because of its nature, like a fire, etc.

Others have accepted that the world is created by Pradhana, etc. Prakriti is the state of equilibrium of Sattva, Rajas and Tamas. It acts for the purpose of the soul, i.e., for enjoyment and liberation. The word "Adi" used with Pradhana means that the principle of Buddhi is born from Prakriti. From Buddhi, Ahamkara, the feeling of "I", is born. From Ahamkara, sixteen principles are born. From those sixteen principles, five elements are born. This is the process of creation. If we accept the principle of nature, then the meaning is that the world is created by nature, like the sharpness of thorns, etc. Others say that the world is created by destiny, like the peacock's feathers, etc. This world is composed of Jiva and Ajīva. Jiva is characterized by its use, while Ajīva is characterized by Dharma, Adharma, Akasha, Pudgala, etc. It is composed of the ocean, mountains, earth, etc.

**Further, to explain the world, it is said that it is composed of Sukha (happiness) and Duhkha (suffering). Sukha is the form of bliss and Ananda, while Duhkha is the form of sorrow and misery. It is appropriate to be composed of both.**

**Commentary on the Commentary:**

Those who believe in God as the creator of the world say that this world is created by God. They try to prove their point by saying that there are different opinions among different philosophers regarding the body, the universe, and the senses. Therefore, all these are debatable. These debatable topics are based on a wise cause, i.e., they are created by an intelligent creator. This is because they have a specific structure, i.e., they have specific parts or organs. This is the reason why things with a specific structure are created by an intelligent creator, like temples, wells, etc., which have a specific structure. Therefore, they are created by an intelligent creator. Similarly, the ocean, mountains, rivers, earth, and body, etc., are also debatable because they have a specific structure. Therefore, they are created by an intelligent creator. The one who is the creator of this entire world cannot be an ordinary human being, but must be God. The body, the universe, the senses, etc., are created by an intelligent creator because they are consequences, like a pot, etc. The body and the senses are created by an intelligent creator because they are active in their respective functions, like fire, etc.

Other philosophers, the Samkhya philosophers, say that this world is created by Pradhana, etc. Prakriti is the state of equilibrium of Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas. It acts for the purpose of the soul, i.e., for enjoyment and liberation. The word "Adi" used with Pradhana means that the principle of Buddhi is born from Prakriti. From Buddhi, Ahamkara, the feeling of "I", is born. From Ahamkara, sixteen principles are born. From those sixteen principles, five elements are born. This is the process of creation. If we accept the principle of nature, then the meaning is that the world is created by nature, like the sharpness of thorns, etc. Others say that the world is created by destiny, like the peacock's feathers, etc. This world is composed of Jiva and Ajīva. Jiva is characterized by its use, while Ajīva is characterized by Dharma, Adharma, Akasha, Pudgala, etc. It is composed of the ocean, mountains, earth, etc.

Further, to explain the world, it is said that it is composed of Sukha (happiness) and Duhkha (suffering). Sukha is the form of bliss and Ananda, while Duhkha is the form of sorrow and misery. It is appropriate to be composed of both.

---------------------------
The **Sri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states that five **Maha Bhutas** (great elements) are born from five **Panchatatmaas** (five subtle elements). This process is how creation arises. Alternatively, the word "**Aadi**" (beginning) refers to inherent nature. Therefore, it means that sharpness is inherent in thorns. Similarly, the entire universe is born from inherent nature, not created by any creator. Other thinkers say that just as the feathers, hair, and other parts of a peacock are created in a beautiful and diverse way by destiny, so too is the entire world born from destiny. Thus, this world, which is born from the causes mentioned earlier, such as God, is filled with conscious beings, **Dharma** (righteousness), **Adharma** (unrighteousness), **Aakash** (space), **Pudgal** (matter), and other non-living things, as well as oceans, mountains, etc. However, to explain the uniqueness of the world, the **Aagam** (scripture) says that the world is filled with both happiness arising from **Aanandaatmak** (blissful) and suffering arising from **Asata** (unfavorable) and **Pratikul** (adverse) experiences.

**"Samyambhuna Kade Loe Iti Vuttam Mahesina.
Marena Santhuya Maya, Tena Loe Asasae."** (Verse 7)

**"Chhaya - Samyambhuva Krto Lok Ityuktam Maharshina.
Marena Sanstuta Maya Tena Loko'ashaashvata."** (Translation)

Some thinkers say that this world was created by **Samyambhu** (self-existent) - Vishnu. Our great sage, **Maharshi**, has said this. **Yama Raja** (the god of death) created **Maya** (illusion). Thus, this world is impermanent.

**_Tika_ -** "Samyambhuna" etc. - **Samyambhu** is Vishnu or someone else who is self-existent. In the beginning, there was only one, who was blissful. He desired another. After this thought, another power arose, and then the creation of the world took place. Our **Maharshi** has said this. Thus, those who believe in the creation of the world accept a creator of the world. Furthermore, they say that **Samyambhu** created the world, but out of fear of the immense burden - the world would continue to grow - he created **Mara** (Yama Raja), who destroys the world. **Mara** created **Maya**. People die because of **Maya**. In reality, there is no destruction of the conscious being, which is characterized by its use. Therefore, the death of a person is just **Maya**. It is not true. Thus, this world is impermanent, non-eternal, and perishable.

Translation:

The Brahmanas and the Shramanas (ascetics) say that this world is created from an egg. They claim that Brahma created the aggregate of substances, and this world is the result of that. Those who say so are indeed ignorant. They do not know the true facts and they speak falsehoods.

The Brahmanas and some Shramanas (such as the Tridashdis) and certain Pauranikas say that this world of mobile and immobile beings is created from an egg. They also say that when there was nothing at all, this universe was in a state of void, then Brahma created the egg in the water, and from that gradually developed the division into the upper and lower worlds. And within that, all the elements came into existence - thus the establishment of the earth, water, fire, air, space, ocean, rivers, and mountains, etc. occurred.

They also say that before the creation of the world, this universe was in a state of darkness, unknown, and indescribable. It was unimaginable, unknowable, and dormant everywhere. In that state of the world, Brahma created the egg, and from the process of that, he created this world. But those Brahmanas and other traditional scholars, not knowing the ultimate truth, speak falsely. The reality is different from what they proclaim.

Page #128:
---------------------------
The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra says, "They describe the world as created by their own means, their own ideas, their own special arguments. They do not know the truth, the reality. This world is never destroyed, never completely wiped out."

Commentary: Now, in response to those who believe in the world being created by gods, Brahma, or Ishvara, it is said: "They describe the world as created by their own means, their own ideas, their own special arguments." For example, they say the world was created by gods, Brahma, Ishvara, the primordial elements, or by itself, or by Maya, or that it is born from an egg, etc. They present their own arguments to prove their point, as if their view is the only truth. All those who hold such views do not know the truth, the ultimate reality, the true nature of the world. They do not understand that the world, in terms of its substance, is not destroyed, not completely wiped out. This world is not created by anyone, but it exists, has existed, and will continue to exist. For example, they say, "The world was created by gods." This is not true. There is no evidence to support the idea that the world was created by gods. And even if there were, such an argument would not convince wise people. Moreover, was the god who created the world born or unborn? If he was unborn, then he would not have the power to create, just like a barren bull. If he was born, then did he create the world by himself or by someone else? If he created it by himself, then why wouldn't the world also have been created by itself? If he was born by someone else, then that someone else must have been born by someone else, and so on, leading to an infinite regress. This is like a vine that spreads endlessly, covering the entire sky. If the god is said to be unborn and eternal, then why not say the same about the world? What is the problem with that? Furthermore, is this eternal god unchanging or changing? If he is unchanging, then he cannot act because he is not subject to the laws of cause and effect. If he is changing, then he would be destroyed after his birth, and he would not be able to protect himself, let alone create anything else. Also, is this god formless or formed? If he is formless, then he would be like space, incapable of acting. If he is formed, then he would be like a human being, who needs tools to act, and it would be clear that he is the creator of the entire world. The arguments of the Devagupta and Devaputra schools are too weak to be considered. The same criticism applies to the Brahma-upta school, as their arguments are similar. It is said that the world was created by a wise being with a specific intention, like a pot, because it has a specific purpose. This is not true, because the existence of a specific cause is not sufficient to prove the existence of a specific effect. The mere existence of a cause only leads to the understanding of a specific effect if there is a pre-existing restriction. But in the case of the world, there is no such restriction. It is said that the pot was created by a potter because we can see the specific purpose of the pot. But we cannot say the same about rivers, oceans, mountains, etc., because we do not see a wise being as the cause of their existence. It is argued that just as we see a specific form in a pot, we also see a specific form in mountains, etc., and therefore we can infer that they were created by a wise being. This is not true, because the mere existence of a specific form does not necessarily imply that it was created by a wise being. If that were the case, then an anthill would also be considered the creation of a potter, because it is made of earth. It is said that if the potter created the pot, then he must have also created the anthill. Therefore, it is clear that the existence of a specific form does not necessarily imply that it was created by a wise being. Only when we see a specific form that is connected to a wise being can we infer that it was created by that being. The form itself is not enough. Moreover, we see a specific potter as the creator of pots, etc.

Page #129:
---------------------------
The statement of the self-time is not the Lord, if it were the Lord, then what would the potter do? This is not the case, even there the Lord is engaged as the cause of the cause by pervading everything. But in this way, there would be a concept of the destruction of what is seen and the creation of what is not seen. Thus it is said:

"From the connection with the medicine of the enemy, etc., the wound of the arrow heals. What is the cause of the stationary object which is not connected?"

Therefore, the concept of the unseen by abandoning the seen cause is not justified. Moreover, the creator of the Devakulaavat, etc., is seen as having parts, non-pervasive, and impermanent. This is also proved by the example, and the Lord is also like this. Otherwise, there is no example of the other, and there is no inference due to the non-establishment of pervasiveness. Staying in this direction, the means of production, etc., should also be considered as means and non-means, because of the equality of yoga and welfare. What is also said, "This world is created by the primary, etc.", is also not appropriate, because what is that primary, is it concrete or abstract? If it is abstract, then the birth of the concrete from the Makarakara, etc., is not possible, because nothing is seen to be born from the sky, because of the contradiction between the concrete and the abstract in terms of cause and effect. If it is concrete, then from where is it born? It is not from itself, because there would be the possibility of the world being born in the same way. Nor is it from another, because of the non-establishment of the other. Just as the primary, etc., exists from the beginning without being born, so also the world should not be considered. Moreover, the primary is said to be the state of equilibrium of sattva, rajas, and tamas. And you do not accept the birth of the great, etc., from the un-modified primary, nor does the designation of the modified primary stand, therefore, there is no birth of the great, etc., from the primary. Moreover, how can the inert have an inclination towards the purpose of man, as stated by you? By which there would be creation with the possibility of enjoyment, if it is said that this is the nature of the primary, then in that case, the nature itself is stronger, which controls even the primary, and from that the world should also be, why the concept of the unseen primary, etc.? If it is said that some people accept the causality of nature from the beginning, then it is not the case, because the nature does not cause us any harm, as it is accepted. Because, nature is nature, its own birth, and that is accepted for all things. And what is said, "This world is created by destiny", there also the regulation is destiny, just as the building is destiny, and when considered, it does not go beyond nature. And what you have said, "The world is created by the self-born", is also not beautiful, because what is said by the self-born? Is it that when it becomes, then it becomes independent and free from others? Or is it designated as self-born because of its beginningless existence? If the acceptance of independent existence is there, then why is the existence of the world not accepted? Is it self-born? If it is beginningless, then because of its beginninglessness, it is eternal, and because of the eternality, it is uniform, and because of the uniformity, there is no possibility of being a doer. And because of being free from attachment, there is no possibility of the diversity of the world, if it is attached, then because of its non-difference from us, it is not the creator of the world. The concrete and abstract, etc., should be considered as before. And what is also said here, "By that Mara is born, and he destroys the world", is just talk, because of the statement of non-doership. And what is said, "This world is born from the egg, etc.", is also inappropriate, because the eggs which are laid by the fish, etc., are just as they are within the egg, so also the world is born, and there is no obstacle seen in this acceptance. And why does that Brahma not create the world until he creates the egg? Why with this difficult, illogical, and egg-concept? If it is so, then some have said that the Brahmanas were born from the mouth of Brahma, the Kshatriyas from the arms, the Vaishyas from the thighs, and the Shudras from the feet. This is also illogical, because the birth of anyone from the mouth of God is not seen. If it is so, then there would be no difference between the varnas, because of the birth from one. And there would be no difference between the Brahmanas, like the Katha Upanishad, etc., because of the birth from one mouth. And there would be no existence of the Upanayana, etc., or if there is, then there would be the possibility of taking the wife of one's own sister, etc. Because of many such defects and evils, this birth of the world should be accepted. Therefore, it is established that those who argue in this way, do not know the truth of the world, which is beginningless and endless, fourteen rajjus in length, in the form of a man with two hands placed on the waist in the Vaishkha place, with a lower world in the form of a wrestler with seven earths, a middle world with countless islands, seas, and bases, an upper world in the form of a wrestler emerging from the sea, made up of dharma, adharma, space, and the essence of life, eternal in terms of substance, momentary in terms of change, the truth of substance established by birth, decay, and permanence, the world of many births established by the beginningless karma of life, marked by the end of the world for those who are free from the eight types of karma, they speak falsely.

- **Śrī Sūtrakr̥tāṅga Sūtraṃ Ṭīkā-rtha** - The Āgama-kāra says that in order to refute the doctrines of those who say that this world is created by gods, etc., 
_Previously discussed, those who believe in other philosophies claim that this world is created by their own desired and agreeable methods. Among them, many say that it is created by Devopta-Devakṛta, many by Brahmopa-Brahmā, and many by Īśvarakṛta-Īśvara. Many say that it is produced by nature, etc., and many say that it is self-created. Those who believe that it is self-created say that it is destroyed by the same self-created Māyā. Many say that it is born from an egg. Those who believe in their own theories, methods, and arguments say that what we have said is true, and what others have said is not true. In reality, these previously mentioned theorists do not know the truth. They do not know what the nature of this world is. They cannot properly analyze it.
The fact is that this world never completely perishes, because it always exists in the form of dravya. Nor is it the case that it was created in the beginning, because this world existed before, exists now, and will continue to exist in the future.
Those who believe in Devopta-vādi, that the world is created by gods, say that this world is Devakṛta. This is completely illogical, because no god created this world. No strong evidence is found in this regard. Scholars and wise men are not satisfied with what has no evidence. They do not accept it. Another doubt arises: the god who created this world, was he born and then created this world, or was he unborn and created it without being born? Here, it is important to understand that he cannot create this world without being born, because what is not born, what does not exist, has no existence, like the horns of a donkey. When there is no existence of oneself, how can one create others? If you believe that he was born and created the world, then what is the solution? Tell me? Was he born on his own, or was he born by someone else? If you believe that he was born on his own, then why not believe that this world was also born on its own? If you believe that he was born from someone else and created this world, then that other god will be born from another third god. That third god will be born from a fourth god. This process of birth will continue indefinitely, and will never stop. This will lead to the fault of Anvastā, which will spread like a vine, without stopping, and will fill the entire sky, so that the root cause of everything will not be proven. If it is said that he is Anadi, that he has no beginning, therefore he is not born, then consider, why not believe that this world is also Anadi? Another question arises: the god who created this world, is he eternal or non-eternal? If you believe him to be eternal, then it will contradict the meaning of action. An eternal substance does not mean an actor. He cannot perform actions simultaneously.
(102)

---------------------------
**Self-Time Statement Authority** and he cannot perform actions in sequence. If he is a dev who is impermanent, then after creation, he is self-destructive, and therefore he is not capable of protecting himself, then how can he undertake the creation or destruction of another? Then the question arises, the dev who created this world, is he concrete or abstract? If he is abstract - formless, then he is like the sky, an inactive entity. The sky is formless, it has no agency, the same will happen with the dev. If he is concrete, then for the accomplishment of the task, a common man needs tools - resources, he will also need resources. Where will the resources come from? In such a situation, he is not the creator of the entire world, this is absolutely clear.

In the third verse of the fifth chapter, the word 'devutte' has come. From the perspective of Prakrit, it forms two forms, Devgupta and Devputra. Their discussion has come before. This is extremely 'falgu' - negligible or insignificant, and therefore not worth listening to. The same fault applies to the Brahmopt side, because it is also similar to the Devgupta side. Those who consider God to be the cause of the world, they state regarding the body, the universe, and the senses, which different thinkers have explained according to their own views, that these are created by a specific intelligent creator, just as a pot is created by someone. Their statement is unreasonable because in a specific cause, the scope of the action is not accepted, but it is accepted in the cause itself. The man who knows that a particular person does a particular work, another cannot do it. That person. By seeing that work, he can guess, estimate the specific person who did it. But in a substance that is extremely invisible, completely inaccessible to sight, such a perception cannot be formed. In other words, a person who has never been seen by anyone creating something, cannot be guessed at by looking at that thing. If it is said that by looking at the pot, its creator, the potter, is guessed, who is a substance of a specific caste, similarly, by looking at the world, its specific doer, God, can be guessed, this is also not logical - factual. Because the pot is a special kind of work. The potter, who is its creator, is seen directly doing it - making the pot. Therefore, it is correct to guess the potter by looking at the pot. It is logical to do so, but God cannot be guessed by looking at the world because the potter, who creates the pot, is directly visible, in the same way, no intelligent doer - God is ever visible creating the river, the ocean, the mountain, etc. Therefore, the specific intelligent creator of the world cannot be guessed by looking at it. If it is said that due to the specific institution - shaped form, the pot, etc. substances are created by an intelligent creator, similarly, due to the specific institution, the mountain, etc. substances are also created by an intelligent creator, it can be proved, it is also not logical to say so because all substances are created by an intelligent creator due to the creation of a specific institution or limbs, it does not appear. If the above statement is accepted, then the Balmik - the mound of earth - the heap, which is the distortion of the earth, should also be created by the potter like the pot, just as the potter creates the pot, etc. substances from the earth. It cannot be stated by looking at it that whatever substances are made from earth.

Page #132:
---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states that all creators are potters because if we accept that the mounds of earth, sand, and clay are created by potters, then it would be proven that even the mounds of earth, sand, and clay are created by potters. This is not a factual statement. Similarly, just by looking at the creation of an institution, we cannot say that all institutions or components that are created are created by an intelligent creator. The reality is that the creation of an institution that is known to be created by an intelligent creator can be used to infer the specific creator of that institution. We cannot infer the creator just by looking at the creation of an institution. We cannot infer the creator God just by looking at the creation of an institution because the specific creator of the creation of pots and other objects is the potter, not God. If God is the creator of the pot, then why do we need to accept the potter? If it is said that God is omnipresent, then his involvement in the creation of pots and other objects is indirect. This leads to the concept of the visible and the invisible. The situation is that the potter, the creator of the pot, is directly available, visible, and not accepting him is a loss of the visible. God, who creates the pot, is never visible, and considering him as the cause of the pot is a hypothesis of the invisible. 
... It has been said that a person named Chaitra's wound heals through surgery with instruments and application of medicine. Therefore, the instruments and medicine are the cause of the healing of his wound, not other substances. Why don't we consider the **sthānu** (a stump) which has no connection with the healing of the wound as the cause of the healing of the wound? Therefore, it is not just to accept the cause of something without accepting the substance that is visible as its cause. It is not just and reasonable. In this context, the creator of the temple, well, or pit is visible as having components, being non-pervasive, and impermanent. Therefore, the God that is proven by their example is visible as having components, being non-pervasive, and impermanent. Therefore, the God that is proven by their example is proven to be having components, non-pervasive, and impermanent. No example can be found to prove the opposite, that is, a God who is without components, pervasive, and eternal. It cannot be proven by inference. Just as this **kāryatva rūpa** (causality) is not capable of proving God, it cannot prove God. Similarly, the reasons that have been given, such as being present first and then acting, cannot prove God. This should be understood here because these reasons are similar to the **kāryatva rūpa** (causality), they are not the means to achieve the desired meaning. The statement that this world is created by nature is also not logical.
The question arises whether nature is concrete or abstract. If it is abstract, then concrete things like the ocean cannot be created from it. Abstract form is an example of this, from which no object is seen to be created. Therefore, the cause-and-effect relationship between the concrete and the abstract is not proven, that is, the abstract cannot be the cause of the concrete. If nature is concrete, then from what...

Page #133:
---------------------------
The question arises regarding the authority of the statement about the self-existent nature of the universe. It cannot be said that it is self-existent, because if it is assumed to be self-existent, then why can't the world also be considered self-existent? It cannot be said that it is created by something else, because if we assume that, then the chain of creation will continue indefinitely, leading to the fallacy of infinite regress. Therefore, just as you consider nature to be uncreated and eternal, why can't the world also be considered uncreated and eternal? You call the state of equilibrium of the three qualities, sattva, rajas, and tamas, as nature. You do not accept the creation of the subtle elements, etc., from that unaltering, unchanging nature. You state that the world is created from nature that is subject to change and alteration, but that which is unchanging and unaltering cannot be nature. Therefore, it is illogical to accept the creation of the subtle elements, etc., from nature. Nature is devoid of consciousness and awareness, then how can it be motivated to fulfill the purpose of the soul, which would enable the soul to become the experiencer and make the creation of the universe possible? If it is said that it is the nature of nature to be motivated to fulfill the purpose of the soul, even though it is unconscious, then nature itself would be weaker than its nature, because nature controls it. In such a situation, why don't you accept nature itself as the cause of the world? Then what is the significance of the concept of an unseen nature, etc.? If you say that by the word "adi" (beginning), you also accept nature as one of the causes of the world, let them accept it, there is no harm in that. Accepting nature as the cause of the world does not pose any obstacle to the beliefs of the Arhats (Jain saints), because one's own nature is called "svabhava" (nature). Jains also accept the creation of substances. There is no fault in accepting the view of those who believe in determinism, who have stated that this world is created by destiny, because the way a substance is, its being in that way, its being fixed in that form, is destiny. Upon reflection, it does not appear to be anything other than nature. The earlier statement that this world is created by the self-existent is also not consistent. What is self-existent? What is its meaning? Consider this. "Self-existent" is that which exists by itself. According to this, when they are self-existent, when they exist independently, do they exist independently without the need for any other cause? Is that why they are called self-existent? Is that why they are eternal? If they are called self-existent because they exist by themselves, then why don't you accept the world as also being self-existent? Then what is the need to accept the self-existent? If they are called self-existent because they are eternal, then they cannot be the creators of the world, because that which is eternal is permanent, and that which is permanent is unchanging. Therefore, it is not possible for such eternal self-existent beings to be the creators of the world. If you say that they are self-existent, devoid of attachment, etc., then they cannot be the creators of this diverse world. If, contrary to being devoid of attachment, you consider them to have attachment, etc., then they are just like us worldly beings, not the creators of the universe. Similarly, one should also consider the collection of concrete and abstract alternatives. The statement that the self-existent created Yama (the god of death), and Yama destroys the world, is also a kind of delusion, because it has already been said that the self-existent cannot be the creator of this world. Whoever has stated that...

Page #134:
---------------------------
It is not logical to say that this world originated from an egg or emerged gradually. Because the water in which the egg was produced was already present before the egg, only then could the egg be deposited in it. Similarly, there is no obstacle in believing that this world was also produced without an egg. Why doesn't Brahma create this world while he is creating the egg? Therefore, this idea of an egg is illogical. What is its purpose? If you say that Brahma creates this world without an egg, well, that is correct. Then there is one thing, someone has said that Brahmins were born from Brahma's mouth, Kshatriyas from his arms, Vaishyas from his thighs, and Shudras from his feet. This statement is also not logical because the birth of anyone from the mouth, etc., is not evident - it is not visible. If this were the case, there would be no difference between the Brahmin, etc., classes. They would not be different because they are all born from the same Brahma. Along with this, there would be no difference between the Kauth, Taittiriya, and Kalap, etc., of the Brahmins because if all the Brahmins were born from Brahma's mouth, then how can there be a difference? In addition to this, the Upanayana ceremony, marriage ceremony, etc., of the Brahmins would also not be possible. If this were to happen, then taking the hand of one's own sister would also be acceptable. Since there are many such flaws, accepting the birth of the world from Brahma's mouth, etc., is not acceptable. Therefore, it is proven that the aforementioned - previously discussed - opinion holders do not know the true nature of this world. Therefore, they present false statements - they present false truths.

This world is above, below, and fourteen rajjus in length. Its shape is like a man standing with his hands on his waist, dancing in a Vaishkhastan - a place for entertainment or a theater. This world is like a squeezed gourd placed upside down with its mouth facing down, and it is composed of seven lower worlds. It is composed of countless islands and oceans, with the middle world as its base, which is shaped like a plate. In its upper part, like the belly of a gourd, is the upper world. In this world, Dharmaastikaya, Adharmaastikaya, Akashaastikaya, Pudgalastikaya, and Jeevaastikaya are pervasive. These are identical, according to the Dravyarthik Nay, they are eternal from the point of view of substance, and according to the Paryayaatmak Nay, they are momentary - changing from moment to moment. It is composed of production, destruction, and permanence. Therefore, it is the nature of substance. The soul and karma are connected from time immemorial. Therefore, this world is connected to various types of births and deaths - coming and going, etc. The liberated soul, free from the eight types of karma, resides in the Lokan - at the end of this world. Those who do not know the true nature of this world, those other opinion holders, speak falsely - they present false truths.

## The Right Time to Speak Out

**Commentary**

Now, to prove the ignorance of those who believe in the teachings of the Devoptavada and others, and to show them the consequences of their beliefs, the author says:

"What is pleasing to the mind, what is beautiful, is called *manojña*. *Manojña* means what is good and pleasant. What is not *manojña* is called *amanojña*. *Amanojña* means wrong conduct or evil karma. The suffering that arises from *amanojña* karma or wrong conduct is called *amanojña samudaya*. The word 'evam' here means 'thus'. It should be understood in this way: suffering arises only from wrong conduct or evil karma. A wise person should understand this. This means that suffering arises only from one's own wrong conduct or evil karma, not from anything else.

Even though this is established, those who follow the teachings mentioned earlier do not understand that suffering arises from wrong conduct. They believe that suffering arises from other causes like God. How can those who believe in such causes understand the means to stop suffering, the means to overcome suffering?

The destruction of the cause leads to the destruction of the effect. But they do not know the true cause of suffering. How can they strive to eliminate suffering without knowing the cause? Even if they strive, they will not be able to eliminate suffering. Instead, they will continue to be bound by the cycle of birth, old age, death, separation from loved ones, and other forms of suffering. They will continue to wander in the cycle of existence like the wheels of a water-wheel, endlessly turning, according to the law of *arhattaghatti*.

## Pure Soul

**Commentary**

Some people believe that the soul is pure, free from sin, but they commit offenses due to their attachment and aversion.

Page #136:
---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

The commentator, explaining the view of the Kritavadins in a different way, says: Here, in this proposition of the Kritavadins, there are three categories of the soul, which are called *trairasika*. According to the followers of Goshalak, there are twenty-one sutras, arranged according to the previous *trairasika* sutra tradition. They say that this soul, being pure, becomes a human being, and by becoming pure in conduct, becomes free from all impurities and blemishes, and becomes free from sin in liberation. This means that all its karmas are eliminated. This is stated by some followers of Goshalak. Again, that soul, being in the state of two categories, purity and non-action, becomes attached to passion or hatred in liberation itself, and becomes stained by the dust of karma. This means that, seeing the worship of his own sect and the defeat of other sects, he experiences joy, and seeing the disrespect of his own sect, he experiences hatred. Thus, that soul, being attached to passion and hatred, gradually becomes stained by the dust of karma, like a clean cloth becomes stained by use. And being stained by karma, it is reborn in the world again due to the weight of karma. In this state, it becomes the third category, the state of being active. || 11 ||

The commentator further explains:

Here, the Muni, born in this world, becomes free from sin. Just as pure water becomes impure, so too does he become impure by sinful actions. || 12 ||

**Translation:**

A being born in this world, becomes a Muni, following the rules of Yama and Niyama, and becomes free from sin. But just as pure water becomes impure, so too does he become impure by sinful actions.

Page #137:
---------------------------
(Self-time statement of authority) _Commentary - Now, to refute this objection, it is said - Indeed, in this human birth, having obtained it, having entered into the order of renunciation, having become a self-controlled soul, having become devoted to the rules, afterwards he becomes free from sin - the taint of all karma is removed, meaning that he becomes free from karma-obstruction. Then, by igniting his own discipline, he becomes liberated. Again, due to seeing the worship and respect of his own discipline, and due to the arising of attachment and aversion, the inner self, which was previously pure, becomes polluted like water, which, though initially clear, becomes muddy due to contact with dust particles carried by the wind. Just as that self becomes polluted, so too this self, after an infinite period of time, having become free from the world, having become established in pure conduct, then, upon attaining liberation, becomes free from karma. Again, due to seeing the worship and respect of his own discipline, attachment and aversion arise, and he becomes bound by karma. Thus, the self is said to be in three states, like the three terms of a rule of three. It is said:
"The fuel that has been burnt does not burn again,
Having destroyed the world, liberation is not to be feared.
Having become liberated himself, and having become a hero for the sake of others,
How can there be a kingdom of delusion in those who have resisted your discipline? ||12||"
Commentary - Now, the author of the scripture says, to refute this view:
The being who obtains human life, accepts the renunciation-initiation, becomes a self-controlled soul, devoted to the rules of restraint. Afterwards, he becomes free from sin - free from sin. All his karmic taint - karmic defects are erased - he becomes free from karma-obstruction. After this, by igniting his own discipline - the religious community - making it bright, by influencing it, he attains liberation. But then, seeing the worship, respect, and honor of his own religion, he becomes attached, and seeing disrespect or insult, he becomes averse. Thus, due to the arising of attachment and aversion, his soul becomes polluted. Just as pure water is initially clear, then it becomes muddy due to contact with dust particles carried by the wind. This means that after an infinite period of time, the being becomes detached from the world, engaged in the practice of pure conduct, and becoming like that, he attains liberation - becomes free from karma. But he again becomes attached seeing the praise of his own religion or sect, and becomes averse seeing neglect. Due to attachment and aversion, he becomes bound by karma. Thus, according to the rule of three, the soul attains three states or conditions. It is said:
"O Lord! What a kingdom of delusion reigns over those men who do not accept your discipline. They ignorantly assert that the liberated being, free from karma, returns to the world. They say this under the influence of delusion. The wood that has been burnt does not burn again. Similarly, the being who becomes liberated after destroying the world does not return to the world. But they, other theorists, believe that even after liberation, the being returns to the world. What a wonder! Such people dare to liberate others."
_These are the views of the wise,
They do not dwell in celibacy.
All these preachers are different,
Each one proclaims his own view. ||13||_
Commentary - The wise, the knowers of the truth of religion, having reflected on the doctrines of these other Tirthankaras, have decided that they do not practice celibacy - restraint. All these preachers are different, each one proclaiming his own view as the truth.

**The Sutra Kritanga Sutra Commentary**

A wise and discerning person, having considered the arguments of these previous proponents, should understand that these proponents of the three categories of existence, and those who believe in the world being created by the gods, do not abide in true celibacy or in the practice of restraint. 

This is because they hold the view that karma binds liberated beings through the praise, honor, and disregard of their own doctrines. However, the reality is that both praise and disregard of their doctrines are inevitable, and this inevitably leads to an increase in karma. An increase in karma leads to a lack of purification, and a lack of purification leads to a lack of liberation. 

Liberated beings, who have shed all karmic stains, who have fulfilled their purpose, who have understood the true nature of all things, who are indifferent to praise and blame, and who have renounced all attachments, cannot be affected by attachment and aversion. Without attachment and aversion, how can there be karmic bondage? And without karmic bondage, how can liberated beings return to the cycle of existence? 

Therefore, although these proponents of false doctrines may practice celibacy in a material sense, they are not truly engaged in the practice of restraint due to their lack of true knowledge. 

All these proponents of false doctrines, driven by their attachment to their own views, proclaim their own doctrines as the best. But those who have truly understood the nature of reality should not have faith in these doctrines. 

**Verse 14**

"In their own positions, there is no other attainment than liberation. 
Indeed, here alone is one who is in control, who has surrendered all desires."

**Commentary**

This verse emphasizes that true liberation is the only goal worth pursuing, and that it can only be achieved through the practice of restraint and the renunciation of all desires.

Page #139:
---------------------------
**Self-Time Statement of Authority**

The attainment of perfection is achieved only through the establishment and practice of one's own principles, and not through any other means. Before attaining liberation, a human being should be in control of their senses and mind. In this way, all their desires and wishes will be fulfilled.

**Commentary**

To show that the principles of the Āgama-kāra (Jain scriptures) are different from those of other schools of thought, the Āgama-kāra says that the followers of other schools, such as the Shaivas (worshippers of Shiva) and the Ekadandīs (those who carry a single staff), establish their own principles and practices. They believe that perfection is achieved through their own practices, such as initiation, following the teachings of a guru, and serving the guru's feet. They claim that perfection cannot be attained through any other means. For example, the Shaivas believe that liberation is attained through initiation, while the Ekadandīs believe that liberation is attained through the knowledge of twenty-five principles. Similarly, other schools of thought, such as the Vedantīs, believe that perfection is attained through the practice of meditation, study, and samadhi. In this way, each school of thought presents its own path to liberation.

The Āgama-kāra states that before attaining liberation, which is characterized by the cessation of all dualities (duḥkha), one attains eight types of powers in this very life through the practice of the principles laid down in their scriptures. The Āgama-kāra says that a person who is in control of their self and senses is not overwhelmed by worldly desires. All their desires and wishes are fulfilled. Before attaining liberation, a person attains eight types of powers, which are:

* **Aṇimā:** The ability to make one's body as small as an atom.
* **Laghimā:** The ability to make one's body as light as cotton.
* **Mahimā:** The ability to make one's body as large as one desires.
* **Prākaṁya:** The ability to fulfill one's desires.
* **Īśitva:** The ability to have complete control over one's body and mind.
* **Vaśitva:** The ability to control others.
* **Apratighātitva:** The ability to not be obstructed by anything.
* **Yatra-kāma-avasyāyitva:** The ability to make anything one desires last as long as one desires.

The Sutra Kritanga Sutra - It is said that those who are free from disease, they are said to be Siddhas.
Those who consider Siddhi as the ultimate goal, they are bound by their own beliefs. ||15||
Commentary - Siddhas are free from disease and are said to be free from all dualities.
Those who consider Siddhi as the ultimate goal, they are bound by their own beliefs. || Translation - Other Tirthankaras believe that Siddhi is attained by being bound by their own doctrines. They say that those who attain Siddhi by following our doctrines are free from disease and suffering.
_ Commentary - Thus, it is said that those who follow our teachings attain Siddhi, which is characterized by eight qualities, and in this world, they attain Siddhi, which is characterized by the cessation of all dualities. - Those who follow our teachings, in this birth, attain Siddhi, which is characterized by eight qualities, and after attaining Siddhi, they abandon their bodies through a special type of Samadhi Yoga, and become Siddhas, free from all dualities, and free from disease. The term "arog" is a euphemism, meaning that they are not touched by any physical or mental suffering, because they are free from body and mind. Thus, in this world, in the discussion of Siddhi, some, like the Shaivas, say this. And these Shaivas, considering Siddhi as the ultimate goal, accept liberation, and are bound by their own beliefs, their own views, and they present arguments that support their views. Like ordinary people, who are ignorant of the scriptures, present arguments to achieve their desired goals, so too, these so-called scholars, who do not know the ultimate truth, present arguments to support their own views. And it is said - A biased person wants to use logic to prove his point, where his mind is fixed. But a person who is free from bias, uses logic where his mind is fixed. ||1||15||
Commentary - Other Tirthankaras say that those who follow our teachings, in this birth, attain Siddhi, which is characterized by eight qualities, and in the next world, they attain liberation. Where all kinds of dualities, troubles, are removed. The Agamkaras show this.
Other opinion holders argue that those who follow the rules and practices mentioned in our philosophy, attain Siddhi, which is characterized by eight qualities, in this birth. Then, by practicing special Samadhi Yoga, they abandon their bodies and attain Siddhatva. They become free from all dualities, free from suffering, and free from disease. Here, the word "arog" is a euphemism, meaning that they are not touched by any kind of physical or mental suffering, because they are free from body and mind, i.e., they transcend body and mind. Shaivas, etc., present their views on Siddhi in this way. They consider Siddhi as the ultimate goal, present it as the main point, are attached to their own doctrines, and present arguments that support them. Just as ordinary people, who are ignorant of the scriptures, use logic to achieve their desired goals, so too, these Shaivas, etc., who do not know the ultimate truth, who consider themselves scholars or knowledgeable, use logic to prove their own biased views. It is said - A biased person, who is fixed on his own beliefs, wants to use logic to prove his point, to twist it in his favor. But a person who is free from bias, accepts the truth, the meaning, or the principle that is logical.

They, devoid of **samvara** (self-control) and **asambhrata** (victory over senses), i.e., under the control of senses, other **tirthankaras** wander in the cycle of birth and death again and again. Due to the influence of **bala tapa** (ignorance-based austerities), they are born in **asura** (demonic) realms for a long time, as **kilvishika** (inferior) gods.

Translation preserving Jain terms:

O you who are conquered by passions! You have no refuge, being conceited fools. Abandoning your previous associations, you have become teachers of duties.

Commentary:
The author, addressing the disciple, says that these (people) who believe in other philosophies are conquered by the six enemies - desire, anger, delusion, greed, pride, and hatred. They have no refuge to escape the cycle of birth and death. They have no stability anywhere. They are truly ignorant, but consider themselves as learned and wise. Though they have abandoned their family relationships and left home, they remain attached to possessions and still give instructions on the duties of a householder.

The connection with the previous section is that in the previous section, it was stated that the heretics are born in the abodes of the Asuras due to their sinful conduct. Why is that so? Because these (people) are conquered by adversities and calamities, and the connection with the previous sutra is this - "He should understand and reject (them)." And then this is also to be understood - just as these proponents of the doctrine of the five elements, the self, and the body, and the followers of the Gosala doctrine, are conquered by adversities and calamities, and by the six enemies of desire, anger, greed, pride, delusion, and intoxication, so the connection with other sutras is also to be inferred.

Having established this connection, the explanation of this sutra is now presented. "These" refers to the proponents of the doctrine of the identity of the five elements, the self, and the body, the followers of the Gosala doctrine, and the Trairasika, who are conquered and overpowered by attachment, aversion, and other sense objects, as well as by the powerful delusion-born ignorance. "O you" is an address to the disciple, meaning "Accept this as such, that these heretics, due to their incorrect instruction, are not worthy of refuge for anyone, nor are they able to protect anyone."

Why is this so? Because they are like children, lacking the discrimination between right and wrong, and whatever they do or say is meaningless. Similarly, these (people) too, though ignorant themselves, delude others. And though being such, they consider themselves learned.

Alternatively, the reading "where the child is lost" indicates that where there is ignorance, the child (i.e., the ignorant person) is lost. There they (the heretics) are established, since they are not able to provide refuge to anyone. And what they have practiced wrongly, that is shown in the latter half - "Abandoning their previous associations" means that abandoning their connections with wealth, grains, and kinsmen, we (the ascetics) have become free from attachments. But again, they are bound and attached to the undertakings of possessions, and the instruction they give is the harmful activity of cooking, serving, grinding, and pounding, etc. for the householders. Or alternatively, "they may be" - the plural is used due to the archaic nature, meaning "the duties, the main activities, those who are teachers of duties, the ascetics, though they have renounced, do not differ from the householders in all situations, being engaged in the five sensual activities."

The translation preserving the Jain terms is as follows:

This Uddeshaka (section) discusses the Svsamaya (own system) Vaktavyata (right to speak) and the Parsamaya (other system) Vaktavyata (right to speak). It either expounds the Svsamaya-Jain principles and the Parsamaya-non-Jain Tirthankaras' principles, or describes the despicable, defective, and faulty conduct of other doctrinal followers in the subsequent Uddeshaka.

Here also, the discussion is in that context. While describing the four Anuyogas (auxiliary texts) associated with this Uddeshaka, one should speak according to the Sutranugama (following the scriptures) - the method of reciting or reading the Sutras (canonical texts). The Sutra is as follows - this Sutra has a connection with the previous Sutra. The previous Sutra stated that the Asura (demonic) Paratirthikas (non-Jain ascetics) are born in unholy wombs. They are Kilvisika (impure) Devas (celestial beings). They are engaged in Kilvisika (trivial) sports and activities.

Raising a question on this topic, it is further stated that why are they like this? While resolving and refuting this, it is said that they are defeated by the Paratirthika Parisaha (self-inflicted hardships) and Upsarga (afflictions caused by others). This is the connection with the previous Sutra.

It was also previously stated that one should attain Bodha (enlightenment) and knowledge, and by doing so, one should break and destroy the bondage of Karmas. Therefore, it should also be known here that the followers of the Panchabhautika (materialistic) and other doctrines, such as the Goshālaka (cow-worshippers), Niyativādīs (fatalists), etc., are defeated by the Parisaha, Upsarga, Kāma (desire), Krodha (anger), Lobha (greed), Māna (pride), Moha (delusion), and Mada-Ahamkāra (intoxication and ego) - the Sad Ripus (six enemies).

Similarly, the connection with other Sutras should also be understood. Thus, this Sutra, which is connected or related to the subsequent Sutras, is discussed in detail here.

The Panchabhautika, Ekātmavādī, Tajjīvataccharīravādī, Kṛtavādī, Trairāśika, Goshālaka followers - all these doctrinal adherents are defeated by the impure emotions of Rāga (attachment), Dvesha (aversion), and the powerful Mahāmoha (great delusion)-induced ignorance, as well as the sense objects like sound, etc.

The word 'Bho' in the Gāthā (verse) is used to address the disciple. As in - "O disciple! You should know that these followers of other doctrines are engaged in preaching teachings contrary to the true and the false. How can they then be capable of protecting others?" They say this because these doctrinal adherents are like ignorant children. Just as innocent, ignorant children, due to the lack of discrimination between the true and the false, say everything, without any understanding of what is right or wrong, similarly, these doctrinal adherents are ignorant. Being ignorant themselves, they delude others. Not only that, but even in their ignorance, they boast of being learned or knowledgeable.

In some places, the reading is 'Jattha bālo'vasīyai', meaning where the ignorant child is distressed, afflicted, or tormented. Similarly, these ignorant doctrinal adherents are afflicted by Klesa (afflictions). They cannot provide any refuge or protection to anyone.

The latter part of this Gāthā expounds on these other doctrinal followers who act contrary to the truth. The word 'Naṃ' here is in the sense of a rhetorical device or sentence embellishment. These other proponents, while renouncing wealth, grains, and kinship ties, claim to have given up attachment. They say they have accepted Pravrajyā (monastic life). While expressing their eagerness to attain liberation, they continue to be engaged in Pariggraha (possessions) and Ārambha-Samārambha (violent activities) harmful to life, such as cooking, getting food cooked, grinding, and pounding, which are the duties of the householders.

In this Gāthā, the word 'Siyā' is an Ārsha (archaic) form, and it is interpreted as a plural.

Page #144:
---------------------------
The English translation preserving the Jain terms is as follows:

The Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra states that other Matavadis (proponents of different philosophical views) are like this. The word 'Krita' means obligatory or sinful performance or intention. Those who primarily engage in such cautious observances are also called 'Kritya'. Thus, this word 'Kritya' indicates the householders. These Paramata-vadis (proponents of other philosophical views) teach the householders about Samrambha (undertaking), Samaarambha (commencement), and Aarambha (activity) - activities involving progressive degrees of violence. Therefore, they are called Krityopadesakas (teachers of sinful activities).

Although they appear to be in the state of Pravrajya (renunciation), they are not different from the householders, but their condition is similar to them. And they commit violence through the five slaughter-houses mentioned in the Manusmriti for the houses of the householders, namely, Panchashuna-chullee-chulha (five hearths), Pesani-chakki (grinding stone), Upaskara-jhadu (equipment-broom), Kandani-unkhali (mortar-pestle), and Upakumbha-jala-sthana (water-pot-place).

The wise and learned Bhikshu (monk), knowing these Tirtthikas (heretics), should not be infatuated with them. He should conduct himself with equanimity, neither exalting himself nor being attached to them.

Page #145:
---------------------------
The one who knows all three worlds, who does not consume any of the eight types of Madhyasthana, who is free from Tavi, who does not have any relationship with other-opinionated householders and Parsva, etc., should behave with a neutral attitude, free from attachment and aversion. This means that if a Sadhu happens to be in contact with someone who holds a different opinion, etc., he should abandon ego, not engage with them emotionally, not feel attachment or aversion, not praise his own qualities or criticize theirs, and spend his time accordingly.

"With possessions and beginnings, these are declared here.
Without possessions and without beginnings, the monk should wander." (3)

**Commentary:**

"With possessions and beginnings, these are declared here.
Without possessions and without beginnings, the monk should wander." (3)

**Translation:**

Many other opinionated people say that those who have possessions and those who begin with violence, etc., attain liberation. But the Bhava-Bhikshu should seek refuge only in those who are free from possessions and completely free from violence, etc.

**Commentary:**

"Why are they not a refuge for the Tirthikas?" - To show this, the Agama-kara says:

Those who live with possessions, such as wealth, grain, bipeds, quadrupeds, etc., are called "Sa-parigrahi." Even in the absence of external wealth, those who are attached to their bodies and instruments are also "Sa-parigrahi." Those who engage in activities that oppress, destroy, or harm living beings are called "Sa-arambha." Even those who do not engage in activities related to the destruction of living beings but consume food prepared for themselves are also "Sa-arambha." Other opinionated people believe that those who have possessions and those who begin with violence, etc., also cultivate the path to liberation. The Agama-kara explains in this regard:

Regarding the afterlife, some people believe that there is no need to shave the head and beard. They say that by the grace of the Guru, one attains the Supreme Akshara, receives initiation, and then attains liberation. Such people are not a refuge. Those who are truly capable of saving are described later:

Those who are free from possessions, except for the means of livelihood, and who have even a small possession for the enjoyment of their bodies, are "A-parigrahi." Those who have no beginning of harmful actions are "A-narambha." Such beings are light in karma, self-liberated, and capable of rescuing beings from the ocean of existence. The Bhikshu, who is virtuous in begging, who does not consume food prepared for himself, should seek refuge in them, go to them, and wander around them. (3)

**Commentary:**

Why can't other opinionated people protect themselves and others? To show this, the Agama-kara says:

Those who possess wealth, grain, bipeds, quadrupeds, etc., are called "Sa-parigrahi." Even in the absence of external wealth, those who are attached to their bodies and instruments are also "Sa-parigrahi." Those who engage in activities that oppress, destroy, or harm living beings are called "Sa-arambha." Even those who do not engage in activities related to the destruction of living beings but consume food prepared for themselves are also "Sa-arambha." Other opinionated people believe that those who have possessions and those who begin with violence, etc., also cultivate the path to liberation. The Agama-kara explains in this regard:

Regarding the afterlife, some people believe that there is no need to shave the head and beard. They say that by the grace of the Guru, one attains the Supreme Akshara, receives initiation, and then attains liberation. Such people are not a refuge. Those who are truly capable of saving are described later:

Those who are free from possessions, except for the means of livelihood, and who have even a small possession for the enjoyment of their bodies, are "A-parigrahi." Those who have no beginning of harmful actions are "A-narambha." Such beings are light in karma, self-liberated, and capable of rescuing beings from the ocean of existence. The Bhikshu, who is virtuous in begging, who does not consume food prepared for himself, should seek refuge in them, go to them, and wander around them. (3)

Page #146:
---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** says: Those who speak in this way, who boast of their own doctrines, are not able to save, shelter, or protect anyone from the ocean of the world.

In the latter part of the verse, the scriptural scholar clarifies: Those who do not possess any possessions for the enjoyment of their bodies, except for the means of sustenance, and who do not engage in any actions that involve violence, such as killing or harming, are those who have light karma - those who have largely eradicated their heavy karma. They are like a boat, capable of carrying beings across the ocean of the world. Therefore, a **bhikshu** who is a pure **bhikshanna** (one who lives on alms), who does not consume food that is tainted with **auddeshik** (intentional) or other defects, should seek refuge in such virtuous men in all respects.

**Verse 4:**

> **Kadesu ghasamesaja, viuu dattesanam care.**
> **Agiddo vippamukko a omaanam parivajjae.**

**Translation:**

> A wise **muni** should seek out food prepared by others, investigating its purity. He should desire to receive only what is given. He should not be greedy or attached to food, free from attachment and aversion, and should avoid insulting others.

**Commentary:**

> How should a **sadhu** who is **aparigrahi** (non-possessive) and **anaramhi** (non-initiator) conduct himself? To show this, the scriptural scholar says: The **grihastha** (householder) prepares rice and other food for his own benefit through the means of possessions and initiation. This is called **krit** (prepared). The **sadhu** should desire to receive alms from this food prepared by others for their own benefit. The word **krit aahar** (prepared food) here indicates the avoidance of sixteen types of **udgama doshas** (defects in the origin of food). **Graas** (food) is that which is swallowed, chewed, or eaten. **Aahar** is also called **graas**. A wise **sadhu** should investigate and seek out food that is free from **udgama doshas**. A **muni** who is skilled in the practice of **samyama** (self-control) should desire to receive only that food which is given by others without any expectation of reward or reciprocation, with the intention of **nihsreyas** (liberation). This indicates the avoidance of sixteen types of **utpadana doshas** (defects in the production of food). The **bhikshu** should accept food that is free from defects such as **dautyadhatri** (given by a servant), **nimitta** (given for a specific purpose), etc. This indicates the avoidance of ten types of **eshanadoshas** (defects in the desire for food). He should be **agrudh** (non-greedy), **anadhyupapanna** (not attached), **amurchhita** (not intoxicated), free from attachment and aversion to food. This also indicates the avoidance of five types of **graaseshanadoshas** (defects in the desire for food). Such a **bhikshu** should avoid insulting others, not indulging in pride of austerity or knowledge.

Translation:

From the perspective of the authority of the topic under discussion, it should be understood that here sixteen types of production defects are included. Therefore, that monk should desire to accept food free from the defects of messenger work, conveying messages of householders, the work of wet-nurses, fondling the children of householders, and so on, as well as occasional and other defects. This statement includes ten types of craving defects. This should be believed, this should be known. The ascetic should remain unattached and unaffected in accepting food. He should remain free and detached from attachment and aversion. This statement eliminates or avoids five types of object-craving defects. Conducting and living in this manner, the monk should not disrespect others. He should not have the ego of his austerity and knowledge.

Many say that one should listen to the statements of the Lokavādins (those who believe in traditional/popular doctrines), but the reality is that the view of those Lokavādins or traditionalists is born from perverted intellect. It is false, untrue, just like the views of other sectarians.

---------------------------
Shri Sutrakritanga Sutram. They expound the opposite nature, propound false meanings. Lokavada (worldly doctrine) also propounds the opposite meaning and untruth. It is a follower of the same - it follows or imitates them.

"The world is infinite, eternal, does not perish.
The wise perceives the world as finite and eternal." (6)

Commentary: To illustrate the perverted intellect of the proponents of the Lokavada, the author says that this world is said to be infinite, i.e., without an end, eternal, i.e., not subject to destruction, and does not perish. That is, whatever is in this existence, the same continues to exist even in the next existence, just as a man remains a man and a woman remains a woman. Or, it is infinite, i.e., without any limit or boundary, and eternal, i.e., devoid of origination and destruction, of uniform nature, and ever-existing. And it is eternal, i.e., it does not abandon its essential nature of being a paramanu (atom) even when it becomes a dyad or triad, etc. Therefore, it does not perish. This is said with reference to space, soul, etc. 

The world is finite, i.e., has a limit, and eternal, i.e., of uniform nature - such a view is held by some daring theorists, as Vyasa and others, who propound an unreal nature of things.

One should listen to the views of the Lokavada. This is connected to the present verse.

Page #149:
---------------------------
There is no realm for a man without a son - he does not attain liberation. A Brahmin is the form of God. Dogs are Yakshas. There is no realm for one who is killed by cows or who kills cows, etc. One should listen to such Lokavada statements that are devoid of justice and logic. Many people say this.

**Verse 7**

**Commentary:** Some opinion holders say that there is certainly a man who knows the immeasurable and the immeasurable, or the transcendental, but he only knows the finite things. He does not know everything. There is no omniscient being.

**Explanation:** There is no measure, either in terms of space or time, for that which is immeasurable. A Tirthankara, as recognized by the Jainas, knows such immeasurable things. This means that he is a knower of the infinite, a seer of the transcendental, but not an omniscient being. Or, if the meaning intended is that he is a knower of the infinite, then he is a seer of the transcendental. And thus it is said:

"Whether he sees everything or not, let him see what is desired. What use is the knowledge of the number of insects to us?"

This is what is said in this world by some who believe in omniscience. This is their assumption. Thus, the wise mind, with its limited knowledge, is limited by space and time, and by the karma it has accumulated. It is thus that the wise man sees excessively. For example, they say that Brahma sleeps for a thousand divine years - years of the gods. In that state, he does not see anything. He wakes up for the same amount of time, and then he sees. Thus, Lokavada is prevalent in many forms.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Verse 8:**

Those who are mobile (**Trasa**) or immobile (**Sthavara**) in this world, are indeed interchangeable.  The mobile sometimes become immobile, and the immobile sometimes become mobile. 

**Commentary:**

This verse addresses the question of rebirth and the nature of existence. It states that all beings, whether mobile or immobile, are subject to a cycle of rebirth and transformation. This cycle is driven by karma, and it is not fixed or predetermined. 

The commentary explains that the term "**Trasa**" refers to beings with two or more senses, such as humans and animals. The term "**Sthavara**" refers to beings that are immobile, such as plants and rocks. 

The commentary further argues that the idea of a fixed and unchanging nature for beings is not supported by evidence. It cites examples from the world to show that beings can change their form and nature over time. 

The commentary also rejects the idea of an infinite and eternal universe, arguing that such a concept is not supported by logic or observation. 

Finally, the commentary emphasizes the importance of understanding the true nature of existence, which is characterized by change and transformation. It concludes that the cycle of rebirth is driven by karma, and that beings are not fixed in their nature.

Page #151:
---------------------------
## Self-Time Statement of Authority

Commentators solve this by stating:

Those who are distressed, experience fear, and become the subject of such perception are called *tris*. Two-sensed and other beings fall under the category of *tris*. They experience the pain of *trisatva*. Those beings who have the *karma* of *sthavara* arising are called *sthavara* beings, such as earth and other beings. Those who are like human beings in one existence, are also like that in the next existence, and are born in the same form, is what the *lokawadis* believe. If this is considered true, then all actions like charity, study, acquiring knowledge, chanting, remembering God, and penance would be meaningless or pointless. But this is not the case. Even the *lokawadis* say that beings are born in a different form. For example, it is said that a man who dies with feces in his body is born as a jackal. Therefore, *sthavara* and forest animals can be born as each other according to their own *karma*. *Tris* can become *sthavara* and *sthavara* can become *tris*.

The *lokawadis* say that this world is infinite and eternal. The solution to this is as follows:

Substances do not perish in relation to their own kind. From this perspective, if the world is called eternal, there is no harm in it. Accepting this, the principle of *parinaami* eternity, which is in accordance with Jain philosophy, is accepted. If you do not accept this and call the world eternal by accepting substances as without origin, without destruction, stable, and having one nature, then this is not true because there is no such substance visible which is without origin and destruction, stable, and always having one nature. Therefore, your opinion is contradicted by direct evidence and is invalid. In this world, there is not a single substance that is not composed of momentary *paryayas* or states. *Paryayas* or states are prohibited substances, like the flower of the sky, which are non-existent and therefore non-existent. If you call the material substance, space, and soul indestructible, then this is also beyond the truth in relation to the particular substance, because all substances in the world are composed of production-origin, expenditure-destruction, and stability-permanence, and are involved in an undivided form without division. If this is not accepted, then the reality of the substance, like the flower of the sky, will not exist.

The *lokawadis* have said that this world is finite because it is composed of seven islands and a surrounding earth. This can only be accepted by your ignorant friends. Those who act thoughtfully and with discernment cannot accept this because there is no evidence to prove it. The *lokawadis* have stated that a man without a son has no world. This is as unreasonable as what a child who speaks childishly says. If having a son alone gives a special world, or if there is a special ritual or work done by the son, or if a special world is obtained simply by the son's good nature, then the entire world will be filled with dogs and pigs because they have many sons. If you accept that a special world is obtained by the good and virtuous rituals performed by the son, then this is also not appropriate because suppose a father has two sons. One has performed good and virtuous rituals and the other has performed evil and sinful rituals. Will the father go to the higher world because of the son who performed virtuous rituals or will he go to the lower world because of the son who performed sinful rituals? At the same time, it will also happen that the *karma* that the father himself has done will be completely useless. Therefore, for the sonless...

Page #152:
---------------------------
"There is no such thing as a world without beings" - this statement is ignorant. The statement that dogs are Yakshas is clearly illogical and not worth listening to. The Lokavadis who say that Tirthankaras know immeasurable and immeasurable things but are not omniscient, are also not truthful. If a man who sees immeasurable things is not omniscient, he will never be able to give advice on things that are to be abandoned, things that are to be accepted, and things that are to be accepted, and therefore he is not worthy of respect by wise men. The knowledge of the number of insects by such a man would also be useful, because a wise man would doubt that just as he does not know about insects, he would not know about other things. Therefore, no one can be influenced by what he says about things that are to be abandoned, things that are to be accepted, because his knowledge is not true, therefore the belief in omniscience is necessary.

It has been stated that Brahmas know nothing in their sleep, they only know when they are awake. This is not unusual, because all beings are like this, because they know nothing in their sleep. They all know when they are awake - when they are awake. The Lokavadis have said that when Brahma sleeps, the world is destroyed and when he wakes up, it is created. This is also not logical, because it has been discussed before. Therefore, it is not necessary to elaborate on it here. In fact, this world is never completely destroyed, nor is it ever completely created. This world is never anything else. This is the statement. Leaving aside the statements of the Lokavadis that this world is infinite, etc., the latter part of the verse sheds light on the true nature of the Agamkar substance.

In this world, all beings, whether they are mobile or immobile, must go from one state to another to experience the fruits of their own actions. This is certain - necessary. The Tris beings go to the immobile state to experience their karma. They are born as immobile beings, and the immobile beings go to the Tris state - they are born as Tris beings, but the Tris beings are born as Vas in the next life, and the immobile beings are born as immobile beings. That is, it is not a rule that a being is born in the next life as it is in this life.

Translation - Those who are generous beings have their state of being gross. All beings keep going from one state to another. All beings are akant dukkha - they consider suffering to be unpleasant. Therefore, no being should be harmed.

## The Right Time to Speak

**Commentary:** To illustrate this point, the text uses the term "Ural" as a broad metaphor for the "world," encompassing the activities, endeavors, and specific states of the community of noble beings. Noble-bodied beings, from their previous states, undergo a transformation from the stages of embryo, fetus, and womb, to the noble states of childhood, youth, and adulthood. This signifies that noble-bodied beings, like humans, experience different stages of life marked by time, such as childhood, youth, etc., which are clearly observable. However, it is not evident that they remain the same throughout their previous lives. Similarly, all stationary and mobile beings undergo various stages of existence, which should be understood. All beings are afflicted by physical and mental suffering, and they are seen to experience different states. Therefore, one should refrain from harming any being. Just as one should avoid causing harm, all beings experience suffering as unpleasant and happiness as pleasant. Therefore, one should not harm any being, including all beings. This verse highlights the impermanence of beings and emphasizes the importance of non-violence.

## The Essence of Knowledge

**Commentary:** Why should one not harm beings? The answer lies in the principle of happiness. This is the essence of knowledge for a wise and discerning individual: to not harm any living being, whether stationary or mobile, and to not cause them any distress. This principle also implies that a wise person would not lie, steal, engage in sexual misconduct, accumulate possessions, or eat after sunset. This is the essence of knowledge, which encompasses all actions.

Page #154:
---------------------------
The Sutra of the Sri Sutra Kritanga is present. Moreover, one should know the equality of non-violence (ahimsa) as non-violence equality (ahimsa samata) in this way: just as my death is painful and unpleasant, so it is for other living beings. The word "eva" signifies determination. Thus, a virtuous and knowledgeable being should not inflict pain or distress on any living being. ||10||

Commentary: The Agamakaras, while presenting the solution to the question of why one should not harm living beings, say:

In this verse, the word "khu" appears. It signifies determination. For a wise and discerning man, this is the essence: it is proper and necessary that he should not harm any living being, whether stationary or mobile. He should not inflict torture or pain on them. Here, not harming is a euphemism, a symbolic representation. From this, one should also understand that a discerning man should not speak falsely, should not take what is not given, should not engage in sexual misconduct, should not accumulate possessions, and should not eat at night. This is the essence and utility of gaining knowledge: that a man should not fall into karmic afflictions.

Understand the equality that arises from non-violence as it truly is. Just as I find death unpleasant and painful, so it is for all living beings. Knowing this, a discerning muni should not inflict pain or distress, suffering or hardship on living beings. He should not cause them to suffer or be tormented.

He who has awakened and is free from greed should properly protect the right conduct (samm).
In walking, sitting, lying down, and eating, he should be mindful. ||11||

Shadow: He who has awakened and is free from greed should properly protect the right conduct.
In walking, sitting, lying down, and eating, he should be mindful.

Translation: A virtuous and well-behaved muni, who is established in virtuous conduct and properly observes it, should be free from desire in matters of food, etc. He should properly protect knowledge, insight, and conduct. He should keep them intact. In walking, sitting, and eating, he should always be mindful of their proper use.

Commentary: The virtuous and well-behaved is described as having ten characteristics. He is said to be as sharp as a sword. He who is established in this, who observes it, is called "vyushita". He who has overcome greed in matters of food, etc., is called "vigata-girdhi", free from greed or desire. A muni who possesses both these qualities, which lead to liberation, should properly protect, observe, and uphold knowledge, insight, and conduct. As these qualities grow, so should he act accordingly.

How is conduct, etc., maintained? This is shown by the words "charan, san, shayya, bhakta, pane, antash". Walking should be done with a purpose, with a view to the moment, by a virtuous man. One should sit on a seat that is well-considered and well-cleaned. One should lie down on a bed or a mat that is well-considered and well-cleaned. Food and drink should be taken with proper mindfulness. This is what is said: food and drink should be taken with mindfulness, with a view to the proper use of the body, and should be free from the defects of excessive eating, etc. ||11||

Page #155:
---------------------------
**Self-Time Statement of Authority:**  May his growth, enhancement, and development be such that he performs actions of the same nature.  How can one practice conduct (charitra) etc.?  In response to this question, the scriptural scholar explains:  Walking or going is called "charya."  When there is a purpose, when it is necessary, if a sadhu goes somewhere, he should walk with only a single-pointed vision.  He should sit on an asana after carefully observing and thoroughly cleaning it.  He should carefully observe and clean his bed and other bedding, and then sit on them.  Similarly, he should be mindful and use proper awareness in eating and drinking.  The meaning is that a sadhu should always be mindful and aware in the "iryā" (walking), "ādan-nikshepa" (taking and depositing), and "pratiṣṭhāpana" (establishment) committees, and should investigate food and water that is free from "udgama" (origin) and other defects.  He should accept alms after carefully searching and inquiring.

**Verse:**

> In these three places, the muni is always restrained.
> He should examine the excellence, burning, covering, and the middle ground.

**Translation:**

> The muni should always be restrained in the three places - the "iryā" committee, the "ādan-nikshepa" committee, and the "eṣaṇā" committee - remaining mindful and free from carelessness.  He should abandon anger, ego, delusion, and greed.

**Commentary:**

> Again, to purify conduct, the scriptural scholar speaks about the qualities:  These three places mentioned earlier are:  "iryā" committee is one place.  "āsana" and "śayyā" (seat and bed) are the "ādan-bhāṇḍa-mātra-nikshepaṇā" committee, which is the second place.  "bhakta-pāna" (food and drink) is the "eṣaṇā" committee, which is the third place.  Since speech is possible when entering a householder's home for food and drink, the "bhāṣā" committee is also included.  Since there is the possibility of speech, excretion, and other things while eating, the "pratiṣṭhāpana" committee is also included.  Therefore, the muni should be properly restrained in these three places, and should strive for liberation.  This is what is meant by the action mentioned in the last line of the next verse.  The muni, who is always constantly aware of the three worlds, is excellent, his self is adorned with pride, and he is established in this way.  This is "utkarṣa" (excellence).  "Māna" (ego) is the one who burns and consumes his own conduct.  "ṇūma" is a deep delusion, because it is not in the middle ground.  "madhyastha" (middle ground) is greed, which is in the midst of the unwholesome.  The word "cha" indicates a collection.  The muni, who knows the results of these four poisons (mānas etc.), should always "viginchaye" (examine) them, meaning he should separate them from himself.  But in another scripture, anger etc. are mentioned first.  The Bhagavan, who is seated on the throne of the "kṣapaka" (forgiving) class, destroys anger etc.  Why then does the scripture scholar violate the established order and mention "mānas" first?  It is said here that anger is necessarily present when ego is present, but ego may or may not be present when anger is present.  This is why the order is changed.

Page #156:
---------------------------
(Sri Sutra Kritanga Sutra) Therefore, the language committee should also know the objection - the language committee should also be taken. On eating, it is possible to have actions like defecation, urination, excretion, and urine. Therefore, the replacement committee also comes here. This is the third place. In these three places, the sadhu should remain active towards liberation, behaving with restraint. One should connect the action of the subsequent verse. The sadhu who knows the three worlds in their true form should abandon pride or ego. The soul is said to be burning with the fire of 'dadhmat-darpa', which burns the soul and character. That is called 'jwalan', which is anger. The muni should also abandon that. Maya is called 'nhum' because its middle cannot be known, it is deep. (The muni should also abandon that). The one who lives among beings until the end of the world is called 'madhyastha', which is greed because it never leaves beings. The muni should abandon that. The word 'ch' is used in this verse. Therefore, the muni who knows the fruit of the four types of kshayas should separate them from the soul forever.
Here, a doubt arises. In other Agamas, anger is described everywhere. The Lord, who is seated in the Kshapaka category, destroys anger, etc. Then, why is 'man' presented first here, bypassing this order, which is famous in the scriptures?
In response to this, it is said that if there is 'man', then there is definitely anger, but if there is anger, then 'man' is both possible and impossible. This is why there is a violation of order here.
"Samite u saya sahu, panch san var sanvude. Siehin asiye bhikku, amokkhay parivvajeasi ||13|| tibemi ||"
Shadow - "Samitastu sada sadhu: panchasamvarasamvrittah.

Translation - The sadhu, who is endowed with the five samitis, protected by the five samvaras, should not have any attachment or greed for householders. He should continuously follow restraint until he attains liberation. This is what I say. Sri Sudharma Swami says to Jambu Swami, this is what I say.
Commentary - Thus, for the sake of summarizing everything, he mentions the primary and secondary qualities - "Turavadharane, panchabhih samitibhih samit eva sadhu: tatha pranatipatadadi-panchamahavratopetattvat panchaprakarasamvarasamvrittah tatha manovakkayaguptiguptah, tatha grihapashadisu sitah baddha avasakta grihasthastesvasitah - anavavaddhasteshv murchamakurvana: pankaadharapankajavat tatkarma na adihyamano bhikshu: - bhikshanasilo bhavaghikshoh amokshay asheshkarmapagamalakshanamokshartham api samantat braje: samyamanusthanarato bhaves tvamiti vineyasya upadeshah.

The statement of the time is: "All are indeed new, there are many ways of speaking, depending on the context. That which is pure from all perspectives, that which is established in the qualities of conduct, is considered pure." ||13||88||

Thus ends the first study of the *Samaya* section of the *Sutrakritanga*.

Commentary: The author of the text, having described the fundamental and secondary qualities, now concludes by stating:

- Here, the word "tu" signifies a concept. The monk should always be endowed with the five virtues and conduct himself in accordance with them. He should abstain from violence, refrain from killing, and observe the five great vows. He should remain guarded by the five restraints, protect his soul, and avoid any faults. He should also remain guarded in his mind, speech, and body, preventing them from engaging in unrighteous activities and protecting himself. He should not be attached to householders who are caught in the trap of family life, just as a lotus remains unstained by the mud even while growing in it. Similarly, even while interacting with householders, the sage should not become attached to them. The mendicant, who sustains himself through begging, should remain engaged in the practice of self-restraint until he attains liberation and all his karmas are destroyed. This is a teaching directed towards the disciple. Here, the word "iti" signifies the end of the chapter. The verb "bravimi" is connected with the *Ganadhara*. He says, "I speak as the *Tirthankara* said, as I have heard." He does not speak from his own intellect or desire.

The exposition of the *Anugam* principles has concluded. Now, the conclusion of the *nayas* is presented. There are many ways of speaking about all the *nayas*. They should be understood as being free from fault from the perspective of all *nayas*. Those who are established in the qualities of conduct, who possess right knowledge and action, are considered pure by the sages.

The *Samaya* section of the *Sutrakritanga* has come to an end.

Page #158:
---------------------------
**Chapter Two of the Sutra Kritanga Sutra, Second Vaitaliya Study**

**First Uddeshaka**

Awake! Why do you not awaken? Enlightenment is indeed difficult to attain after death. The nights that pass do not return, nor is life easily regained.

**Commentary:**

This sutra, free from errors and possessing other virtues, is to be recited. Here, the Bhagavan, the first Tirthankara, addresses his sons, filled with compassion for those who have rejected the path of liberation. He also speaks to the gods, demons, humans, and animals, saying: "Awake! You should attain enlightenment in the Dharma, which is characterized by knowledge, vision, and conduct. For such an opportunity is difficult to obtain. Even if one is born as a human, and even if one is born in a noble family in a land of righteousness, and even if one possesses all the senses and has attained faith and hearing, and even if one has a firm understanding of oneself, why do you not awaken?"

The meaning is that when one has attained all these qualities, one should abandon all trivial pleasures and engage in the Dharma to attain enlightenment. As it is said: "In the human birth, which is conducive to liberation and happiness, and which is endowed with the Jain Dharma, one should not indulge in the fleeting pleasures of the senses, even though they are easily attainable. Even if one finds a treasure trove filled with precious stones like lapis lazuli, why would one choose to pick up a small piece of shining glass?"

For those who have not practiced the Dharma, enlightenment, which is characterized by right faith, knowledge, and conduct, is indeed very difficult to attain after death. As it is said: "Due to carelessness, one who has once deviated from the practice of Dharma will wander in the cycle of birth and death for an infinite period of time."

The word "hurit" signifies that the nights that have passed do not return, nor does the time of youth return. As it is said: "Having obtained the rare human birth, what carelessness is this that I have not attained liberation? Even the king of the gods cannot return to life after death."

Life, which is characterized by restraint, is not easily attainable in this world. Even if one has life, if it is cut short, it cannot be restored.

The meaning of the sutra is that enlightenment awakens the sleeping soul. Sleep is like a dream, and awakening is like waking up from sleep. The four types of deposits are: name, form, knowledge, and conduct. Here, the author emphasizes the deposit of form, ignoring the deposit of name.

The sutra says: "Form is asleep, and it is awakened by knowledge, faith, and restraint. It is said that there is no attachment, and knowledge, faith, and conduct are practiced."

This verse shows that form is asleep and is awakened by enlightenment. The first and last parts of the verse include the sleep of form, the sleep of the soul, and enlightenment. The sleep of form includes the sleep of the senses, the sleep of perception, and the sleep of the mind. The sleep of the soul is the absence of knowledge, vision, and conduct. The awakening of form is the awakening of the sleeping soul, and the awakening of the soul is the awakening of knowledge, vision, conduct, austerity, and restraint.

The verse also shows that the awakening of the soul leads to liberation. This is clearly shown in the second half of the verse.

Since there are two types of sleep, one of form and one of the soul, there are four types of awakenings.

Page #159:
---------------------------
##  Vaitaliya Study Commentary - According to Sutragama

The recitation of the sutra should be done with adherence to the flawless, primordial qualities. The first Tirthankara, Lord Rishabhdev, addressing those who had developed dispassion, those who had been rejected by Bharat Chakravarti, or addressing the gods, demons, humans, snakes, and animals, says: "O noble beings! You should attain the knowledge of Dharma, which is in the form of right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct, because such an opportunity is rare."

It is very difficult to obtain a human birth, a land of karma, an Aryan country, a noble family, birth and residence, and the ability of all senses to perform their respective functions.

Seeing the eagerness to listen and the origin of faith, the Lord expresses his thoughts, saying: "Why do you not attain the knowledge of right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct? A wise man who has obtained the aforementioned materials should abandon the consumption of trivial and insignificant matters and attain the knowledge of true Dharma. The Dharma, which is the true bliss in the form of liberation, propounded by the Jina, is available in this human existence. It is not appropriate to consume trivial, insignificant, and unpleasant objects of desire that cause suffering. If a sea filled with vaidurya and other gems is obtained, then how appropriate is it to take a dull, insignificant piece of glass? It is never appropriate. The man who has not practiced Dharma will find it difficult to attain knowledge, faith, and conduct in the afterlife. The word 'khalu' in this verse is determinative. A man who indulges in worldly pleasures and becomes corrupt even once from the practice of Dharma, wanders in this world for an infinite period. This is what the Agamas say. Here, the word 'hu' is used in the sense of determination. The nights that have passed, do not return. The time of youth, etc., that has passed, does not return. It is said:

"Alas! Why am I negligent, even after obtaining this human birth, which is difficult to obtain even after millions of births? The lifespan that has passed does not return, even if it is that of Indra. In this world, a righteous life, where restraint is paramount, is not easily attainable. A broken thread of life cannot be mended. It cannot be joined again." This is the meaning of this verse.

The word 'sambodh' means awakening. A man who is asleep, who is in deep sleep, is awakened. When sleep arises, there is sleep and slumber. There are four deposits, namely, name, sleep, awakening, and establishment. Of these, the commentators explain the deposit of the appointed substance and the deposit of feeling, leaving aside the deposit of name and establishment. In this verse, the substance of sleep and the feeling of awakening are expressed. The substance of sleep is the beginning, and the feeling of awakening is the end. Therefore, by accepting the beginning and the end, one should also accept the feeling of sleep and the substance of awakening in between.

The sleep experienced due to the rise of the darshanavaran karma is the substance of sleep, and the absence of knowledge, faith, and conduct is the feeling of sleep. The awakening of a sleeping man in the substance of sleep is the substance of awakening, and the self-possession of knowledge, faith, conduct, austerity, and restraint are the feelings of awakening. Here, only the feeling of awakening is described. This is clearly revealed by the latter part of this verse. Here, one should understand four distinctions from sleep and awakening, in relation to the distinction between substance and feeling.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Verse 2:**

"Even children, old people, and those in the womb, humans abandon this life, they die. Just as a hawk seizes a partridge, so too does death seize life when the lifespan is exhausted."

**Commentary:**

"The Lord, showing that the lifespan of all beings in the world is not fixed, but subject to beginnings and endings, says: 'Even children, old people, and those in the womb, humans abandon this life, they die. See this, you! Who are they? Humans. Humans are the ones who deserve to be taught, so the term 'humans' is used. Because lifespan is subject to many dangers, all beings abandon their lives in all stages of life. For example, even someone with a lifespan of three palya (a unit of time) dies within a moment after reaching the end of their lifespan. And it is said, 'A being dies in the womb, or at birth.' Here, an example is given: Just as a hawk, a type of bird, seizes a partridge, a type of bird, and kills it, so too does death seize the lives of beings. When the cause of the beginning of the lifespan is exhausted, or when the lifespan is exhausted, the life of beings is broken, cut off, and destroyed."

**Verse 3:**

"By mothers and fathers, they are robbed, a good path is not easily attained after death. Seeing these fears, the virtuous should refrain from the beginning."

## Vaitaliya Study Translation - 

There are many people in the world who wander due to attachment to their parents, family, etc. They do not attain liberation after death, when their life's play ends. Therefore, attachment to parents, etc., is a fear. A man who observes vows perfectly, seeing these fears, should abstain from violence from the beginning.

**Commentary:**

Some people, due to attachment to their parents and family affection, do not strive for Dharma. They are led astray by their parents and family, and wander in the world. As it is said, "The wicked creator has created chains of bondage in the form of parents, children, wife, and relatives, which are not made of iron, but are much stronger than iron."

Such a person, whose mind is clouded by attachment, is devoid of the ability to discern right from wrong. He is willing to do anything to support his family, and is condemned by the righteous in this world. Even after death, he does not attain liberation in the next birth. Instead, he suffers due to his attachment to his parents, and his desire for worldly pleasures, leading to a bad destiny.

Thus, these are the fears, the causes of fear, and the paths to bad destinies. A man who is virtuous, seeing these, should abstain from all wrong conduct from the beginning, and remain steadfast.

**Another reading:**

The world is full of beings who are entangled in their actions. They are bound by their own deeds and cannot escape their consequences.

**Translation:**

Those who do not abandon wrong and sinful actions in this world suffer greatly. Beings residing in different places and species, go to hell and other places of torment to experience the fruits of their actions. They cannot escape the consequences of their actions without experiencing them.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra - Commentary

**The commentary explains the fault of those who do not renounce their vices:**

"Why is this the case for those who have not renounced their vices? In the world, those who are separate, who are distinct, who are burdened with karmas accumulated through the performance of virtuous and vicious actions, wander in the realms of torment like hell, etc. They themselves are bound by the karmas they have created, not by any other cause like God, etc. They enter the realms of torment like hell, etc., or they accumulate those karmas which are the cause of suffering. This shows the cause-and-effect relationship of karmas. And the being is not untouched or unaffected by the consequences of his evil actions. He does not attain liberation without experiencing the ripening of his karmas and without undergoing special austerities, initiation, etc."

**Commentary:**

The author of the scripture states that those who are not free from vicious and sinful actions, are distinct and separate from the path of liberation. They are bound by their karmas and wander in realms of torment like hell, etc. This is not due to any external cause like God, etc., but due to their own actions. They experience suffering because of their karmas. This establishes the cause-and-effect relationship between actions and suffering. The being cannot escape the consequences of his actions without experiencing them. He cannot attain liberation without undergoing special austerities, initiation, etc.

**Verse 5:**

"Devas, Gandharvas, Rakshasas, Asuras, Earth-dwellers, Reptiles, Kings, Merchants, Brahmanas, all these abandon their abodes when they are afflicted."

**Commentary:**

The commentary explains that all beings in this world, including Devas, Gandharvas, Rakshasas, Asuras, Earth-dwellers, Reptiles, Kings, Merchants, and Brahmanas, are subject to suffering and death. They all abandon their abodes when they are afflicted. This emphasizes the impermanence of all worldly things.

The study of Vaitaliya is such that specific people and ordinary men, the best people of the city and Brahmins, etc., all leave their respective places with great sorrow. All beings experience extreme suffering when they die.
"Those who are attached to sensual pleasures and worldly objects, like vultures, are bound by their karma and suffer accordingly. Just as a ripe fruit falls from a palm tree when its bond is broken, so too do these beings perish when their lifespan is exhausted." (6)
Commentary: The phrase "kaamehi" etc. refers to those who are attached to sensual pleasures and worldly objects, like vultures, and who are bound by their karma. They suffer the consequences of their actions in due time. This means that those who seek pleasure and indulge in worldly objects only experience suffering in this life and the next, and never attain peace. As it is said:
"He who seeks to subdue his desires through indulgence in worldly objects, is like a man who runs towards his own shadow in the afternoon, trying to catch it."
The text further states that those who are about to die cannot be saved by sensual pleasures or worldly objects. Just as a ripe fruit falls from a palm tree when its bond is broken, so too do these beings perish when their lifespan is exhausted. (6)

## Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Translation:**

**Verse 7:**

Even if someone is well-versed in scriptures, deeply religious, a Brahmin, or a monk, if they engage in deceitful actions, they will suffer greatly as a result of their karma.

**Commentary:**

Even if someone is well-versed in scriptures, understands their meaning, is religious and follows Dharma, is a Brahmin, or a monk who lives by begging, if they engage in deceitful actions, they will be tormented by their karma. This torment will be both pleasant and unpleasant, and they will be cut down and oppressed by their actions.

**Verse 8:**

Look! Many other Tirthankaras arise, abandoning the impermanent world with its attachments, but they cannot cross the ocean of Samsara because they do not properly follow restraint. They speak of liberation but do not strive for it. How can you, by taking refuge in them, know this world and the next? These other Tirthankaras are cut down and oppressed by their actions, failing to achieve their goal in the middle of their journey.

**Commentary:**

There is no path to liberation other than right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct. This is because these three are the essence of the scriptures. Therefore, the Sutra refutes the Dharma of those who will come after, who claim to show a path to liberation separate from right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct.

The Sutra says: "Look! Some Tirthankaras arise, abandoning attachments and the world, but they are not liberated from Samsara because they lack proper knowledge. They only talk about liberation, but they do not practice it. How can you, who have taken refuge in them, know this world and the next? These other Tirthankaras are cut down and oppressed by their actions, failing to achieve their goal in the middle of their journey."

**Commentary:**

The word 'ath' used in this story signifies authority or command. 

Addressing the disciple, the Lord says: Many other Tirthankaras, understanding the impermanence of the world, renounce possessions and embrace renunciation. They strive for liberation. They wish to cross the ocean of the world, but due to the lack of right knowledge, they only discuss liberation or the means of attaining it, namely restraint. They merely talk about it but do not follow it because they do not know how to do so. O disciple! If you also follow the path shown by them, how will you know the 'aar' - this existence and the next existence - this world and the afterlife? Or, the meaning of 'aar' is also the dharma of a householder, the dharma of the world, how will you cross it - how will you cross it by accepting renunciation? Or, one meaning of 'aar' is the world and the meaning of 'paar' is liberation. How will you know both of these? A man who walks on the path of other religions is corrupted from both sides and is cut off by actions in the middle - he is oppressed.

"Even if one is naked and thin, even if one eats only once a month,
If one is bound by this Maya, one will continue to be born in wombs."

Commentary: Even though a Tirthankara may be without possessions and has a body burnt by austerities, why does he not attain liberation? The author raises this doubt and explains: Even though a Tirthankara, a tapasvi, etc., renounces external possessions and becomes a renunciant, becomes naked due to the absence of clothes, and becomes thin due to austerity, and performs his own renunciate practices, even though he performs austerities like the sixth, eighth, tenth, twelfth, etc., and eats only once a month, he is still not freed from internal passions. This is shown by the verse: "He who is bound by this Maya, etc." This is explained as being bound by passions. He will go from womb to womb, endlessly, for an unlimited time. This means that even a poor man, even a man whose body is burnt by austerities, will not be freed from hell, etc., and will continue to wander in the world from womb to womb for an unlimited time, like a fire that burns.

Commentary meaning: Many other religious followers are without possessions - they have no possessions. They burn their bodies with austerities. Still, why do they not attain liberation? The author raises this doubt and explains. 
Even though many Tirthankaras, tapasvis, etc., are connected to traditions that renounce external possessions, they become renunciants by renouncing possessions, they remain naked by giving up clothes, they become thin and weak due to hardship. They accept their own

The Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra, those who practice the rules of pravrajya-diksha, perform austerities for two days, three days, four days, and five days. Ultimately, they perform austerities for a month. Despite this, if they are unable to destroy their inner kshaya-krodha, mana, maya, and lobha, if they are unable to conquer them, then they cannot attain moksha. The scriptures reveal that:

Those beings who are attached to maya, etc., in this world, continue to be born in the womb for an infinite period of time. They continue to experience birth and death. Here, maya also signifies other kshayas. The meaning is that a person who is akinchana - who has nothing in terms of possessions, whose body is purified by austerities, but if they are unable to conquer kshayas - if they are unable to abandon anger, etc., then they suffer the torments and pains of hell, etc. From there, they go to the animal realm. Again, they repeatedly experience the womb and die. Just as the person named Agnisharma had to wander in this world in this way, so too do these individuals have to wander in this world.

**_ Sanna iha kamam urcchitaah moham yanti nara asanvrtaaah_**

**Anuvaad -** O man! Do not be engaged in evil deeds, abandon them. Understand! The life of humans is finite or mortal. Those humans who are attached to worldly pleasures and desires in this world, and are unconscious and lost, and are not free from evil deeds like violence, etc., they attain moha. They become deluded.

**Teekaarth -** The scriptures reveal that the austerities prescribed by those with false vision do not prevent the path to hell. Therefore, one should remain steadfast in the path that we have described. Revealing this truth, they say:

O man! Abandon the evil deeds in which you are constantly engaged, and free yourself from the sinful karma that you have accumulated. For even if the life of humans is very long, it does not exceed three palyopamas. The life of humans...

Page #167:
---------------------------
The study of Vaitaliya (Jain philosophy) takes place only within the context of a restrained life, and even then, only up to a certain level. Human life is transient; it should be considered as past or gone. Therefore, this human life is short-lived and temporary. Knowing this, one should strive to make it successful through the practice of religious duties until it ends. Those who, having obtained human life, come into this world and get stuck in the mud of pleasures and remain attached to lust, are deluded. They do not know how to obtain their true benefit and abandon harm. Such men bind themselves with mohaniya karma (karma that leads to attachment). Those who abstain from sinful acts like violence, who do not wander, and whose senses are unrestrained, also accumulate mohaniya karma.

"**Jayam viharahi jogavam, anupaana pantha duruttara.**
**Anusasanamaeva pakkame virehi samman paveiyam.** ||19||
**Chhaya -** Yatmano vihar yogavan, anupraana panthano duruttara.
**Anusasanamaeva prakamade, virehi samyak praveditam.**
**Anuvaad -** Human, you should wander with diligence and awareness, keeping your mind, speech, and body in yoga (restraint) or with samiti gupti (secret practices). This path is filled with anupraana (microscopic beings). Without proper care, it is difficult to cross. You should follow the discipline and restraint as prescribed in the scriptures. All Tirthankaras have preached, instructed, and commanded this.

**Tika -** Evamcha sthite yadvidheyam tadarshayitumanah, svalpam jivitam avagamy vishayancha klesha praayanavabudhya chhitva grihapashabandhanam yatmano yatnam kurvan praninanam anuprodhen vihar udyukta vihari bhava. Etadeva darshayati

**Tikaarth -** In the above situation, to reveal what is the duty of a human, the Agamkar (Jain scriptures) say:
"O man! Knowing your life to be short-lived and the objects of sense to be mostly painful, cut off the ties of household life and strive diligently to be a wanderer, not harming any living beings." The scripture writers say: "O man! You should become gupti gupt (secretly restrained) and samiti samit (following the rules of samiti). Why so? Because these paths are filled with microscopic beings. Without proper care, it is difficult to cross them, because without such care, there will be harm to living beings on those paths.

Jain Terms Preserved:

The Acharya has indicated towards the Irya Samiti (Carefulness in walking) through the Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra. The Irya Samiti is just an example. All other Samitis (Carefulness) should be taken from this. The way described in the scriptures, the same way the Samyama (Self-restraint) should be practiced. All the Tirthankaras (Enlightened Beings) have emphasized this point.

Virya vira samutthiya, kohakaya riyaipesana.
Pane na hananti savvaso, pavaao viraya'bhinivvuda.

Translation:
The courageous ones, who have risen above, are the crushers of anger, pride, deceit, and greed. They do not kill any living being completely, for they are established in Virati (Abstinence) and have been liberated from sins.

Commentary:
The ones who are abstinent from sins like violence, falsehood, etc., and have particularly destroyed their Karmas, and have risen above by abandoning the undertakings of violence, etc., they are the Viras (Courageous ones). They have conquered anger, pride, deceit, and greed. They do not kill any living being completely through their mind, speech, and body. They are abstinent from all sins and are tranquil like the liberated souls.

Navi ta ahameva luppe, luppanti lo amsi panino.
Evam sahiehi pasae, anihe se pudhe ahiyasae.

Translation:
Not even by them am I harmed, but the living beings in the world are harmed. Thus, the one who is free from possessiveness, when he sees with equanimity, he endures what is inflicted on him.

Page #169:
---------------------------
##  Vaitaliya Study Translation -  

A man with true vision and wisdom should reflect that he is not the only one who suffers from cold, heat, and other afflictions. He is not the only one who experiences hardship, but there are other beings in the world who are also afflicted by these afflictions. Therefore, he should endure them without anger, intolerance, etc.

**Commentary:**

This is another teaching - these afflictions and obstacles should be endured with the following thought: "I am not the only one who suffers from cold, heat, etc. There are other beings in this world, both animals and humans, who are suffering from these afflictions. They are suffering greatly, and because they lack proper understanding, they do not receive the fruit of liberation. For it is said: "Patience is not gained through forbearance, nor is domestic happiness abandoned through contentment. The unbearable cold, heat, and wind afflictions are not endured through austerity. The contemplation of wealth day and night with controlled breath does not lead to the ultimate truth. Those who perform actions for the sake of happiness are deceived by their fruits."

Therefore, enduring afflictions is a virtue for those with proper understanding, who have embraced restraint. As it is said: "Hunger-induced work, eating coarse food, enduring cold and heat, roughness on the head, sleeping on the bare ground - these are considered degradation and suffering for a householder, but they are considered elevation for a restrained monk. Thus, even faults become virtues when placed in the right place."

Therefore, a monk, united with knowledge and other virtues, should see his own benefit and, with a wise mind, should reflect on the suffering of others. He should not be distressed by anger, etc., even when he is being harmed. He should endure afflictions with a clear mind and not allow his mind to be disturbed. If he is not harmed, then his austerity and restraint in enduring afflictions are not hidden, but manifest.

**This is the essence of the commentary:**

A wise man should reflect and endure afflictions and obstacles, knowing that he is not the only one who suffers from cold, heat, etc., but that there are many other animals, birds, humans, etc., in the world who are suffering from them. These beings are devoid of right knowledge. Therefore, even while enduring suffering, they cannot attain the fruit of liberation, which is the liberation from karma. Therefore, a wise person has said: "A person thinks that he has endured the suffering of cold, heat, etc., but not with a calm and peaceful mind, but out of weakness and compulsion. He has abandoned the pleasures of a householder, but not because of contentment, but because of the unfulfilled desires. He has endured the unbearable suffering of cold, heat, and wind, but not out of a sense of austerity. He has contemplated religion day and night, but not with a mind free from duality, with a calm mind, contemplating the ultimate truth, the nature of the Supreme Self. He has performed all the actions that ascetic monks perform, with the goal of attaining happiness, but he has not received their fruit."

Those who follow restraint and have noble thoughts, who endure suffering, do so for their own good, for their welfare, or for their benefit. Therefore, a wise poet has said: "The thinness and weakness that comes to the body from lack of food, the suffering that comes from eating coarse food, the suffering that comes from enduring cold and heat, the roughness that comes to the hair from not applying oil, and the discomfort that comes from sleeping on the bare ground without a bed - these are considered degradation and suffering for a householder, but they are considered elevation for a restrained monk. This proves that even faults become virtues when placed in the right place."

Therefore, a monk, united with knowledge and other virtues, who is devoted to his own welfare, should reflect on the above facts and control anger, etc. He should become very patient and tolerant, enduring cold, heat, etc. He should not grieve in any way when he is obstructed by cold, heat, etc. Such a monk should not hide his inner strength, which comes from following austerity and restraint and enduring afflictions. He should not keep it hidden, but manifest it.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Verse 14:**

Just as a wall plastered with dung and mud is made thin by removing the plaster, so too should a muni make his body thin through fasting and other austerities. He should follow the path of non-violence. This is what the Muni has taught.

**Commentary:**

The meaning of "Dhunia" etc. is as follows: Just as a wall plastered with dung and mud becomes thin by removing the plaster, similarly, a muni should make his body thin by fasting and other austerities. He should reduce his flesh and blood. This is because when the flesh and blood of the body become thin, the karmas also become thin. The word "Vihimsa" refers to various types of violence. Not doing them is called "Ahimsa". It is the duty of a muni to fully follow the path of non-violence. He should live his life with non-violence as the primary principle. The dharma that is conducive to liberation is called "Anudharma". This is non-violence, bearing the consequences of actions with equanimity, and enduring hardships with equanimity. The omniscient Lord has declared these to be dharma.

**Verse 15:**

Just as a bird shakes off the dust clinging to its body, so too does a tapaswi, endowed with excellent vows, destroy his karmas through austerities.

**Commentary:**

Just as a bird, covered with dust, shakes its body and removes the clinging dust, so too does a tapaswi, endowed with excellent vows and who is fit for liberation, destroys his karmas through austerities like fasting. He removes the karmas of knowledge, belief, and action. A tapaswi is a virtuous person who is called "Mahan" because he has the attitude of "Do not kill".

Page #171:
---------------------------
The study of the Vaitaliya text, in the context of the verse, refers to the Sauņi-Śakuni or Śakuni bird. Just as a bird shakes off the dust particles clinging to its body, similarly, a follower of the Ahimsa Dharma, who is worthy of liberation and attainment of Moksha, sheds the karmas like knowledge-obscuring karmas, along with austerities like vows of celibacy and fasting. "Upadhana" refers to that which establishes a being near Moksha. Fasting and other austerities fall under this category. The word "Mahan" appears in the verse. "Mahan" refers to one who does not have the tendency to harm living beings. In Prakrit, "Mahan" becomes "Mahan."

**Verse 16:**

"The mendicant, who has renounced the household and is dedicated to the practice of austerity, stands firm in his resolve. Even if his aged parents, children, and grandchildren plead with him to return home, they will not be able to sway him."

**Commentary:**

The verse begins with the phrase "Uṭṭhiye," which indicates the renunciation of the household. The mendicant is described as "Śramaṇa," one who practices austerity, and "Tāpasvi," one who is dedicated to self-discipline. He is also described as "Sthāna-sthita," one who is firmly established in his practice. Even if his family members, including his parents, children, and grandchildren, try to persuade him to return home, they will not be able to move him. They may become exhausted in their efforts, but they will not be able to sway the mendicant, who has attained the ultimate goal of life, Moksha.

**Verse 17:**

"If the relatives weep and lament, even if they cry out for their son, the mendicant, who has renounced the world, will not be swayed. They will not be able to persuade him to return."

**Commentary:**

The verse emphasizes the unwavering resolve of the mendicant. Even if his relatives weep and lament, even if they cry out for their son, the mendicant will not be swayed. He has renounced the world and is dedicated to the pursuit of Moksha. He will not be persuaded to return to the household, even by the most heartfelt pleas of his family members.

Page #172:
---------------------------
**Śrī Sūtrakrtaṅga Sūtra, Chāyā:** If they were to do compassionate things, if they were to weep because of a son,
A mendicant who has arisen from wealth, they would not be able to obtain, nor establish.

**Anuvāda:** If the parents, relatives, etc., of a virtuous person come to him and speak words that arouse compassion, or do things that cause pity, or weep for a son, even then they cannot corrupt the virtuous person who is devoted to restraint. They cannot bring him back to household life.

**Tīkā:** Even though those parents, father, son, spouse, etc., come together to him and perform actions or speak words that are primarily compassionate and like lamentation, for example:
"Oh dear, oh beloved, oh master, oh very dear! You are rare in the world. Without you, everything is empty. What is the point of everything?" "The clan, the village, the group, the assembly, wherever you are present, is filled with your presence. Oh virtuous one! Why are you in this state of renunciation?"

Similarly, if it is said "they weep," they weep because of a son, for the sake of a son, to increase the family, to produce a son, and then you should do this again. If they weep and say this, even though the mendicant is free from attachment and aversion, and is worthy of liberation, and has arisen from wealth, and has arisen from proper restraint, they will not be able to obtain the mendicant, nor will they be able to corrupt him from his renunciation, nor will they be able to establish him in household life, nor will they be able to make him abandon the external signs of a mendicant.

**Tīkā-artha:** The parents, son, wife, etc., of a muni come to him and speak words that are full of lamentation and compassionate, or they weep, or they do things that arouse compassion, such as the worldly wife of the muni saying to him: "Oh lord! Oh dear! Oh beloved! Oh master! Oh very dear! You are rare in the house - you are not available to us. Oh useless one! Oh unkind one! Without you, everything seems empty. Oh virtuous one! Wherever you are present, in whatever clan, village, or group, they are all illuminated by your glory - then why is your house not illuminated by you? What is the wonder in that?" Weeping for a son, she says: "Produce a son for the increase, expansion, or development of your family, and then you can accept the path of restraint." In short, by weeping and speaking in this way, the family members cannot corrupt the excellent mendicant who is free from attachment and aversion, who is engaged in the practice of restraint for the sake of liberation, from his renunciation, from the path of restraint and practice that he has adopted. They cannot bring him back to household life, nor can they make him abandon the external signs of a mendicant.

**Jaivīya Kāmehi Lāviyā, Jahaṇejāhi ṇa Bandhiuṁ Gharam:**
Even if they were to be attached to worldly desires, even if they were to bind him to a house,
If the living being does not desire worldly things, they will not be able to obtain him, nor establish him.

**Chāyā:** Even if they were to be attached to desires, even if they were to bind him to a house,
If the living being does not desire worldly things, they will not be able to obtain him, nor establish him.

##  **Vaitaliya Study**

**Translation:** If a muni's relatives tempt him with the allure of worldly pleasures, and he refuses to return home, even if they bind him and take him away, the muni should not desire an unrestrained life. In such a situation, those relatives cannot control him. They cannot make him a householder.

**Commentary:**  Even though they, with their love, try to entice the muni, who has risen through his own virtuous efforts and restraint, with desires in the form of tempting him, inviting him, and alluring him, this signifies the acceptance of favorable circumstances. Similarly, if they take him home by binding him, as indicated by the word 'ण' in the sentence, even if the muni is overwhelmed by both favorable and unfavorable circumstances, if he does not desire life, if he does not desire an unrestrained life, or if he does not welcome it, then his relatives cannot obtain him. They cannot attain him, they cannot make him their own. They cannot establish him as a householder.

**Commentary Meaning:** A muni who is dedicated to the practice of restraint, if his relatives come to him and tempt him with worldly pleasures, thus presenting him with favorable circumstances, and if he does not accept, and they bind him and take him home, thus presenting him with unfavorable circumstances, meaning he is overwhelmed by both favorable and unfavorable circumstances, the muni should not desire life, he should not care. If he does not welcome an unrestrained life, does not like it, then his family members cannot control him, and they cannot establish the muni as a householder, they cannot make him a householder again. In this presented verse, the word 'णं' is used as a figure of speech.

**Verse 19:**

**Shadow:**  Those who have a sense of 'mine' - parents and children - teach him with affection.

**Translation:** The muni's parents, children, wife, etc., come to him and explain to him, "Look! You are a seer, a subtle observer. You know everything deeply. Therefore, nourish us. You are ruining the afterlife by not taking care of us, so come and nourish us."

**Commentary:**  And sometimes, his parents, etc., teach him, as indicated by the word 'ण' in the sentence. They say, "This is mine," with such affection. How do they teach him? The text explains: "Look at us, we are extremely distressed due to the lack of your support, and you, as you are, are a seer of the truth, a subtle observer, meaning you have good hearing." Therefore, nourish us, be vigilant towards us. Otherwise, by accepting renunciation, you have abandoned this world, and by abandoning our care, you are also abandoning the afterlife. They say this with their distress over their own care, and with the desire to gain merit. As it is said:

"That path, which is burning with suffering, for those who are attached to their homes, for those who are attached to their homes, for those who are wandering with their children and wives, go to that path, my child."

**Commentary Meaning:** A newly initiated muni is approached by his parents and other relatives, who try to convince him. Here, the word 'णं' is used as a figure of speech. The muni's relatives, thinking, "This is ours," teach him with affection. The scriptures explain how they teach him, how they convince him. They say, "Look! You are a seer, a subtle observer. You know everything deeply. Therefore, nourish us. You are ruining the afterlife by not taking care of us, so come and nourish us."

Page #174:
---------------------------
The Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra. We are extremely saddened. There is no one else to nourish and sustain us besides you. You understand this well. You are a meticulous observer of subtle situations and you are a well-educated scholar. Therefore, nourish us, take care of us, otherwise just think, you have become a disciple and destroyed this world and by abandoning our sustenance, you are also ruining your afterlife.  Virtue is gained by nurturing your distressed family. Therefore, the scriptures say, addressing the son:
O son! The householder is consumed by hardship in order to sustain his son and wife, he nourishes and sustains them with great suffering. This is the way of householders, or their way of life. You too should follow the same. 
Those who are not restrained, are deluded by others and go towards delusion. They are drawn into the unevenness by the uneven, and they are again overwhelmed by sin. 
Commentary: Some are cowardly and may do this, as it is said, "Others" etc. Some are of weak character and are deluded by others, their parents etc., and are drawn in. They are not restrained, they are deluded by others, they are deluded in their practice.  Since it is the sole cause of worldly existence, unevenness, unrestraint, is drawn in by the objects of unrestraint, by those who are on the wrong path, who are afraid of hell, by passion and aversion, which are ingrained from beginningless time, and are difficult to break, they are drawn into unrestraint.  And those who are thus, are again involved in sinful actions, they are overwhelmed, they have become arrogant, they do sinful actions and are not ashamed. 
Commentary meaning: Some are cowardly, who, when favorable circumstances are presented by their parents etc., do as they do. The scriptures describe this. 
Many men of weak character, are deluded by their parents etc., and are attached to worldly things, they become deluded. They deviate from right vision, right practice etc. In reality, apart from right vision etc., all the things of this world, even one's own body, are not one's own, they are others. Therefore, here, everything except the soul is called other. The main cause of the soul's repeated births and deaths in the world is unrestraint. Therefore, here, unrestraint is called unevenness. Those who walk on the wrong path, who are not afraid of their destruction, are brought into unrestraint by those who are unrestrained, they are pushed back into household life, and they engage in sin with arrogance. Passion and aversion are ingrained in worldly beings from beginningless time.

## Study of Vaitalaya

The study is ongoing. Therefore, it is difficult to separate them. Hence, attachment and aversion are called uneven here. Due to attachment and aversion, or motivated by them, those cowardly men who accept an unrestrained life begin to practice sinful deeds with audacity. This means that they are not ashamed of doing evil.

**Verse 21:**

**Translation:**

O wise man! You are discerning, free from sin, and tranquil. Therefore, look at the truth - behold! Those valiant men who are capable of destroying actions walk on the path that surely leads to liberation, the path that grants the attainment of perfection.

**Commentary:**

Since this is the case, what should be done? The text says: Since parents and others are prone to sinful deeds due to delusion, therefore, the worthy one, who is the object of liberation, should contemplate the consequences of attachment and aversion, being free from them. The wise man is endowed with right discernment, free from sinful actions, which are the form of wrong conduct, and tranquil due to the abandonment of anger, etc. Thus, the text describes the great path, the path of liberation, which is the path of knowledge, etc., as the path that leads to liberation, the path that grants liberation, and is certain and unchanging. Having understood this, one should follow that path, and not become bold in wrong conduct.

**Verse 22:**

**Translation:**

Having come to the path of liberation, one should be restrained in mind, speech, and body. Abandoning wealth, relatives, and beginnings, one should live with a well-restrained life. This is what I say.

Page #176:
---------------------------
Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra Translation - One should adopt the path that is capable of destroying karmas, and become endowed with manogupti, vakgupti and kayagupti, and renounce wealth, family members and the initiation of ceremonies, and become a supreme ascetic and wander.
- Commentary - Again, concluding with further instruction, it is said, 'Veyaliyam magga' etc., having become one who has come to the path of destruction of karma, one should renounce wealth, property, as well as relatives and family members, and also the initiation of sinful acts, and become one who is restrained in the senses, and practice restraint. This is what I say, as before. ||22|| Thus ends the first uddeśaka of the second study of the Vaitaliya.
Commentary Meaning - The author of the Agama, again giving instruction, concludes this uddeśaka by saying that one should walk on the path that is capable of destroying karmas, and remain restrained in mind, speech and body - mental, verbal and physical, and renounce wealth, family members and sinful acts, and walk on the path of restraint, not being controlled by the senses. Shri Sudharma Swami says this to Jambu Swami.
The first uddeśaka of the second study of the Vaitaliya is concluded.

##  Vaitaliya Study
## Second Uddeshaka

**Commentary:**  The second Uddeshaka begins after the first one ends. It follows the first Uddeshaka, as the first one describes the Dharma teachings given by Bhagavan Rishabha to his sons, and this second Uddeshaka also discusses the same Dharma teachings. The subject matter of this Uddeshaka is Dharma Upadesha. 

The connection between this Uddeshaka and the previous Sutra is as follows: The previous Sutra mentioned the abandonment of external possessions, family, and worldly beginnings. This Uddeshaka emphasizes the abandonment of internal pride, as indicated by the subject matter of the Uddeshaka. 

The first Sutra of this Uddeshaka is:

**Tayasam va jahai se rayam, iti sankhaya muni na majjai.
Go yannatarena mahanena, aha seyakari anneesi inkhini. ||1||**

**Shadow:**  Just as a snake sheds its skin, so too does the Muni abandon the eight types of Karma, understanding that this is the way to be free from Kashaya. 

**Translation:**  Just as a snake sheds its skin, so too does a Muni abandon the eight types of Karma, understanding that this is the way to be free from Kashaya.  A Muni, knowing this, does not become proud of his lineage, caste, or other worldly achievements. He does not belittle or criticize others, as this leads to the destruction of his own well-being.

**Commentary:**  Just as a snake sheds its skin, so too does a virtuous person abandon the eight types of Karma, as they are the cause of Kashaya.  Knowing this, the Muni, who is aware of the three periods of time, does not become proud. He does not engage in actions that lead to pride.  The term "Mahan" refers to a virtuous person, and the text also mentions "Jeviu," which means a wise and discerning person.  Such a person does not become proud of his lineage or caste.  Not only should he avoid pride, but he should also avoid criticizing others.  The text further states that a virtuous person should not engage in actions that lead to the destruction of others' well-being.

The following two Sutras, "Tavasamjamanaanesuvi" and "Jai Maano Vajio Mahasihim," are connected to the previous Sutra, "Tayasam va jahai se rayam."

**Tavasamjamanaanesuvi, jai maano vajio mahesihim attasamukkarisattham kim pun hi la u anneesim? ||43||**

**Jai tav nijaram ao, padisiddho atta maana mahanena. Aviseesamayatthana pariharaivva payattena. ||44||**

**Translation:**  Even if a person is engaged in Tapas, Samyama, and Jnana for the purpose of self-improvement, if he is proud, even if he is praised by great sages, what is the use of criticizing others?  If a person is truly free from pride, then he will avoid all forms of pride, even if he is praised by great sages.  He will strive to eliminate all forms of pride.

**Veyaaliyassa Nijjutti Sampatta.**

**Translation:**  This is the true nature of the Veyaaliya.

Page #178:
---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** is the sole cause of liberation. The eight types of pride have been prohibited by the Arhats. The remaining pride, such as that arising from birth, should be abandoned with great effort. This is the meaning of the two verses.

**Commentary:**

Just as a snake sheds its skin because it is no longer useful, so too do the restrained practitioners abandon their eight types of karma, like dust particles. These karmas do not bind because they are devoid of passions. When passions are absent in life, then karma is also absent.

The Muni, who knows the past, present, and future, does not become intoxicated by pride. They do not become arrogant.

The Agamkaras state that pride arises from the lineage of Kashyap and others. The word "anyatar" refers to other lineages that give rise to pride. Individuals born into these lineages consider themselves superior to others and are consumed by pride.

The word "mahan" refers to the virtuous. In some places, the reading "jeviu" is found, which means that the virtuous do not take pride in their caste, lineage, or wealth. The virtuous should not be proud, nor should they criticize or slander others. The Agamkaras provide this insight. The word "ath" indicates that slander leads to sin and binds one to misfortune. Therefore, one should never slander anyone.

The commentator presents two verses that touch upon the essence of the verses: Great practitioners, who have abandoned pride in their austerities, restraint, and knowledge, which promote self-improvement, have also abandoned the practice of criticizing others. They naturally abandon it.

**Nirjara** - the path to liberation - is the sole cause of liberation. The eight types of pride have been prohibited by the Arhats. They should not be proud of them. Then what to speak of pride arising from birth, lineage, and other sources of pride? These should be abandoned with great effort. This is the meaning of the two verses.

**Translation of the verses:**

"He who despises another person wanders in this world for a long time. Knowing that slander accumulates sin, the Muni does not become intoxicated with pride and does not slander anyone."

## Vaitaliya Study Commentary -  On the Fault of Criticizing Others

**Commentary:**

The commentary, citing the verse "Jo Paribhavaee" (He who despises), explains the faults of criticizing others. It states that anyone who despises another, who is not themselves, will be reborn in the cycle of transmigration (Samsara) for a long time, like a pot on a wheel. This is due to the karma generated by such actions. The word "Atha" here signifies "therefore," as the ultimate consequence of criticizing others is endless transmigration. Therefore, criticizing others is considered "Papika" (sinful) or "Doshavati" (faulty). It leads to a fall from a higher state to a lower one. This is illustrated by the example of a pig, and also a priest being reborn as a dog in the next life.

Understanding this, a Muni (Jain monk) should not be proud of their lineage, knowledge, or austerities. They should not consider themselves superior to others.

**Verse 3:**

**Shadow Verse:**

"Yashchapyanayaka syaad yo'pi cha preshyapreshyah syaat |
Yo mounpadam upastthito no lajet samatam sadacharet ||"

**Translation:**

"Even if one is without a master (anayaka) or is a servant of a servant (preshyapreshy), if they both embrace the path of restraint (mounpadam) and become a Muni, they should not feel ashamed and should always practice equality (samatam)."

**Commentary:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of humility and equality, even for those who are seemingly at the top or bottom of the social hierarchy. It states that even a king or a servant of a servant, if they embrace the path of Jainism, should not feel superior or inferior to each other. They should practice equality and respect.

Page #180:
---------------------------
The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra states that even a Chakravarti (universal emperor), who is the master of all, should not feel ashamed to bow down to a former servant who has now attained the Muni (ascetic) status. This is because the Muni has attained a higher state of being, and the Chakravarti should not feel superior. The Sutra emphasizes that a Bhikshu (monk) should always maintain "Samata" (equality) and "Samabhava" (equanimity) and be devoted to "Samyama" (self-control).

The commentary explains that even a Chakravarti, who is the master of all, should not feel ashamed to bow down to a former servant who has now attained the Muni (ascetic) status. This is because the Muni has attained a higher state of being, and the Chakravarti should not feel superior. The commentary further explains that a Bhikshu (monk) should always maintain "Samata" (equality) and "Samabhava" (equanimity) and be devoted to "Samyama" (self-control).

The commentary also explains that a Muni should always maintain "Samata" (equality) and "Samabhava" (equanimity) and be devoted to "Samyama" (self-control). The Muni should not feel ashamed to bow down to a former servant who has now attained the Muni (ascetic) status. This is because the Muni has attained a higher state of being, and the Chakravarti should not feel superior.

Should one engage in Vaitaliya studies? In response to this question, it is explained that as long as Devadatta or Yajnadutta exist in the world, one should follow the path of restraint with a good resolve, keeping one's soul established in the pursuit of knowledge and worship, in accordance with this prevalent story. In this way, a sage, free from the material essence of attachment and aversion, fit for liberation, and endowed with the discernment of truth and falsehood, should observe restraint throughout their life. The implication is that even after death, the story of a person named Devadatta continues to circulate in the world. Therefore, it is stated here that until the time of death arrives, the muni should remain engaged in the practice of restraint, abandoning shame and pride.

**"The muni, seeing the distant goal, the path of Dharma, is struck by harsh words, even when being beaten, remains steadfast in his time."** (5)

**Translation:** The muni, the knower of the past, present, and future, the seer of the distant - liberation, even when struck by harsh words, tormented, and beaten with punishments, remains steadfast on the path of restraint.

**Commentary:** What is the basis for this conduct? It is explained that due to its distance, liberation is referred to as "distant." Or, a long period of time is called "distant." Therefore, the muni, the knower of the three times - present, past, and future, seeing the distant, i.e., liberation, and contemplating the distant time, should not be affected by shame or pride.

What is the meaning of contemplating the distant time? The commentator explains:

The muni should observe the past, which is connected to the nature or Dharma of beings, and as a result of which they go to higher or lower realms. He should also keep his sight on the future. He should understand the nature of both. While doing so, the muni should not be affected by shame or pride. Even when beaten with sticks, whips, or harsh words, he should follow the path of restraint as described in the scriptures, like the disciple of Skandha Muni. Here, the alternative reading "samya-ahiyasae" means "enduring with equanimity." (5)

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Verse 6:**

The Muni, who has attained perfect wisdom, should always overcome the obstacles and hindrances - the afflictions - that have been described above, with equanimity. 
**[Pannha Samatte Saya Jae Samata Dhamma Mudahre Muni. Sume U Saya Alusae No Kujjhe No Mani Mahanee.]**

**Commentary:**

The commentary further explains the meaning of the verse:

"The one who has attained perfect wisdom, who is wise and discerning, is called 'Prajna Samāpta'. Another reading is 'Pannha Sammatthe', which means 'one who is capable of answering questions'. Such a virtuous person should always conquer the afflictions, and should preach the principles of equality, non-violence, etc., with equanimity. He should never allow any hindrance to his self-control. He should never be angry, nor should he be proud."

**Verse 7:**

The Dharma is worthy of being honored and accepted by many people. 
**[Bahujannammani Samvudo Savvatthehim Nare Anisshie.]**

The virtuous person, always vigilant in upholding the Dharma, should not be attached to external things like wealth and possessions. Like a clear lake, he should always be pure and manifest the Dharma taught by Lord Mahavira, the Kashyapa. He should follow it himself and inspire others to do the same.
**[Hridaev Saya Ana Vile Dhammam Padurakasi Kasavam.]**

**Translation:**

The Dharma is worthy of being honored and accepted by many people. The virtuous person, always vigilant in upholding the Dharma, should not be attached to external things like wealth and possessions. Like a clear lake, he should always be pure and manifest the Dharma taught by Lord Mahavira, the Kashyapa. He should follow it himself and inspire others to do the same.

##  Commentary on the Vaitaliya Study

**It is said that the religion which attracts many people towards itself, or which is praised by them, is called "Bahujanaman". This is because religion is praised and lauded by many people in accordance with their own feelings and inclinations. How?**

**A story is presented to explain this:**

In the city of Rajagriha, King Shrenik ruled. One day, he was sitting in his court with his son, Abhaykumar, who possessed four types of wisdom. They were enjoying various stories when a question arose: **"Are there many righteous people in this world, or are there many unrighteous people?"**

The entire assembly responded, **"There are many unrighteous people in this world, but only one person in a hundred follows the path of righteousness."**

Abhaykumar then said, **"It seems that most people are righteous. If you are not sure, let us conduct a test."**

The assembly agreed. Abhaykumar then ordered the construction of two palaces, one white and one black. He then announced throughout the city by beating a drum, **"Whoever is righteous in this city should enter the white palace, and whoever is unrighteous should enter the black palace."**

Everyone in the city entered the white palace. When they came out, Abhaykumar asked each person, **"How are you righteous?"**

One person replied, **"I am a farmer. Many birds feed themselves with my grains. I give them food and thus practice righteousness."**

Another said, **"I am a Brahmin. I perform the six duties of a Brahmin, maintain great purity, and perform rituals prescribed in the Vedas. I please my ancestors and gods."**

Another said, **"I am a merchant. I earn my livelihood by giving alms and performing other good deeds."**

Another said, **"I am a householder. I earn my living honestly and support my family."**

Even the cook said, **"I follow the dharma of my family. Many meat-eaters depend on me for their livelihood."**

In this way, everyone justified their actions and claimed to be righteous.

Meanwhile, two Shravakas entered the black palace. They were asked, **"What unrighteous deeds have you committed that you have come here?"**

They were ashamed and confused. They said, **"True righteous people are those who have taken vows and are able to keep them. We, however, have broken our vow of abstaining from alcohol."**

They felt that they were unrighteous because of this transgression. They considered themselves the lowest of the low and entered the black palace.

**The following verses explain their situation:**

"Having obtained a human birth, and having received the Jain teachings,
Having taken the vow of abstaining from alcohol, they have not kept it properly." (1)

"Considering themselves unrighteous because of this transgression of their vow,
They have entered the black palace, considering themselves the lowest of the low." (2)

"Shame is the mother of all virtues.
Those who are truly pure of heart and follow the path of righteousness,
Even if they are powerful and wealthy, they abandon all worldly pleasures.
Those who are devoted to their vows do not break their promises." (3)

"It is better to enter a blazing fire than to break a vow that has been kept for a long time.
It is better to die with a pure heart than to live with a broken vow." (4)

**Thus, it is clear that most people consider themselves righteous. This is why the religion that attracts many people is called "Bahujanaman".**

**The text then goes on to describe a person who is truly righteous. This person is described as being pure of heart, free from attachment, and unmoved by external influences. This person is able to manifest true religion.**

**The text concludes by mentioning the example of Kashyapa, the first Tirthankara, who manifested true religion.**

**This commentary explains the concept of "Bahujanaman" and contrasts it with true religion, which is characterized by purity of heart, detachment, and unwavering commitment to the path of righteousness.**

Page #184:
---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** was being recited. Then a question arose: are there more righteous people in this world or more unrighteous? When the assembly members were asked their opinion, everyone said that there are more unrighteous men in the world. Only one or two out of a hundred would follow Dharma. Hearing this, Abhaykumar said, "You are all righteous. If you are not sure about this, if you have doubts, then you can investigate." The assembly members agreed.

Then Abhaykumar built two palaces, one white and one black. He announced in the city that anyone who is righteous should enter the white palace with all their worship materials, and those who do not consider themselves righteous should go to the black palace. After that, everyone went to the white palace. When they started to leave the palace, they were asked how they were righteous. One said, "I am a farmer. Many birds are satisfied and satiated by the grains of my crops, and I give alms from the grain I get from the threshing floor, which gives me Dharma. Therefore, I am righteous." Another said, "I am a Brahmin. I perform Tarpan for the Pitris and Devas. Therefore, I am righteous." Another said, "I am a merchant, a descendant of a good family. I earn my living through trade. I do acts of charity and alms-giving. Therefore, I am righteous." Another said, "I am a son of a good family, a noble, righteous, and independent man who takes care of his family. Therefore, I am righteous." Finally, a Shvapak-Chandala also said, "I follow the Dharma that has been passed down through generations in my family. And many meat-eaters live under my protection. Therefore, I am righteous." Thus, everyone started to establish Dharma in their own profession and activities, but two Shramanopasakas entered the black palace. When they were asked what sin they had committed, they said, "We had taken a vow to abstain from drinking alcohol. We broke it once. In reality, only the Munis are truly righteous in this world because they are able to follow the rules they have accepted. It is a matter of great sorrow that we have obtained human birth, received the Jain Shastra, and even after giving up drinking alcohol, we could not keep our promise. We broke the rule, violated the vow, and therefore, considering ourselves unrighteous and the lowest of the low, we entered the black palace because a vow is the mother of good qualities like shame, etc. It gives birth to them. It is like a pure-hearted, worshipable mother. Those who follow it are strong, full of self-courage, and true to their vows. They willingly give up their lives but do not abandon the vow they have taken. It is better to enter a blazing fire than to break a vow that has been accumulated for a long time. It is better for a pure-minded, noble-hearted man to die than for a person who has fallen from virtue to live."

Thus, everyone often considers themselves righteous. This is why Dharma, which is called the great people's religion, is right. A human being who is aware of Dharma does not get attached to wealth, property, grain, various substances, spouse, internal attachment, etc., but embodies Dharma in life. He is truly righteous. The Uttaragatha is related to this.

## Vaitaliya Study

An illustration is given in this context. A pond filled with pure water does not become polluted or dirty even with the movement of many aquatic creatures. Similarly, a Sadhu, even while living in the world, does not become polluted. They embody the ten virtues of peace, forgiveness, etc., in their lives. The Sadhu, living this way, illuminates the Dharma as described by the Tirthankara Deva. In this verse, due to the use of Chandaas or Aarsh, the past tense is used to refer to the present.

**Verse:**

> Bahve Paana Pudho Sia Patteyam Samayam Samihiya.
> Jo Monapadum Uvatthiye, Viratim Tattha Akasi Pandie. ||8||

**Shadow:**

> Bahvah Praanah Prithak Shritah Pratyekam Samatam Sameekshya.
> Yo Maunapadam Upasthito Viratim Tattra Karsheet Panditah. ||

**Translation:**

> In this world, there are many beings who live separately in their own places. The wise Muni sees them all with equanimity. He remains on the path of restraint and should refrain from harming beings - remain separate.

**Commentary:**

> To show how a Sadhu, who is revered by many, illuminates Dharma, the Agamkar says:

> Due to the possession of ten types of Pranas, an inseparable connection is established between beings with Pranas. Therefore, they are called Pranas here. In this world, infinite beings reside, who are different from each other in terms of their form, such as earth, subtle, cloud-like, substantial, attaining substantiality, not attaining substantiality, and residing in hell, etc. Although they live separately, each being hates suffering and desires happiness. They do not want suffering, they want happiness. This is the same tendency in all beings. Knowing this, and maintaining a neutral attitude towards all beings, and staying away from inauspicious practices that hinder the path of restraint, the wise and knowledgeable person should refrain from harming beings who are different in form, who hate suffering, and who desire happiness.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Verse:**

The one who has transcended Dharma, who is free from the beginning of violence, is truly a Muni. Those who are attached to possessions, who yearn for wealth, are filled with sorrow, yet they cannot obtain their possessions.

**Commentary:**

One who has transcended Dharma, who is knowledgeable about the principles of Dharma, who follows the path of Dharma, who is free from the beginning of violence, is truly a Muni. Those who are not like this, who do not practice Dharma, are filled with sorrow when they face death or suffering. This verse uses the word "ṇam" as a figure of speech. Those who are attached to possessions, who think "this is mine," "I am the owner of this," are filled with sorrow when they lose their possessions, whether through death or destruction. Even though they grieve, they cannot obtain their lost possessions. Possessions are those things that are brought under one's control, made one's own, or taken. Gold and other valuables, as well as family members, are considered possessions. When gold is lost or family members die, they cannot be obtained. Or, when a Muni, who has transcended Dharma, who is free from the beginning of violence, is approached by his family members, they grieve, showing their attachment. They consider the Muni to be their possession, but they cannot obtain him.

**Shadow Verse:**

The wise person does not dwell in a house, for worldly suffering is painful, and the suffering of the afterlife is also painful. This Dharma, which leads to destruction, is painful.

Page #187:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Vaitaliya Study Translation -** Attachment, which includes gold, silver, and other wealth, as well as family members, is sorrowful in this world and the next. All of these are perishable. Who is the person who knows this truth, this reality, and still considers living in a house, being a householder, or living a worldly life to be good for them?

**Commentary -** Here, the Nagārjunīya text reads, "Soūṇ tayaṁ uvatṭhiyaṁ kei gihī viġġheṇa udviyā. Dhammaṁmi aṇuttare muṇī, tampi jiṇijja imeṇa paṇḍie." (1) This means, "Someone who has come to know the Muni, a householder comes to create obstacles for them. The Muni, who is the supreme in Dharma, defeats them with their wisdom." (1)

This is because, in this very world, gold, silver, and family members bring sorrow. "Viū" means to know, and it is said, "There is sorrow in earning wealth, sorrow in protecting it, sorrow in its arrival, sorrow in its expenditure, and sorrow in its possession." (1)

It is also said, "O elephant! You have the water of the Revā river, the leaves of the Sallaki tree, and your own beautiful family. Why are you suffering, being consumed by desire for a female elephant? This attachment is the root of endless suffering." (2)

In the next world, there is also sorrow born from karma, which arises from attachment to gold, silver, family members, etc. This is another sorrow, which arises from the karma of attachment. This means that even what is earned is perishable, fleeting, and prone to destruction. Knowing this, who is the wise person who would willingly live in a house, embrace the life of a householder, and bind themselves with the shackles of a home?

It is said, "Wives are the cause of humiliation, relatives are a bondage, worldly pleasures are poison. What is this delusion of people? They have hope for friendship in those who are actually their enemies." (10)

**Commentary on the Commentary -** According to the Nagārjunīya text, the passage here reads "Soūṇ" etc., meaning that a householder, upon knowing the Muni, comes to create obstacles for them. The Muni, who is the supreme in Dharma, defeats them with their wisdom. This is what the sutra writer is discussing.

Gold, silver, and other precious things, as well as family and relatives, are sorrowful even in this world. It is said, "There is great sorrow in earning wealth, great hardship in acquiring it, and suffering in protecting it." Thus, there is much suffering in its arrival, its expenditure, or its loss. This wealth is worthy of condemnation, a vessel of sorrow. In the context of enjoyment, it is said to the elephant, "O elephant! You have the water of the Revā river, the leaves of the Sallaki tree, and your own beautiful family. Why are you suffering, being consumed by desire for a female elephant? This worldly attachment is the root of endless suffering."

Attachment to gold, silver, and wealth, and being engrossed in them, also leads to suffering in the next world. That suffering then gives rise to new suffering, because it compels the person to engage in further negative actions. The fruits of those actions are also sorrowful. The wealth that is earned does not last forever. It is not stable, it is destroyed. Who is the wise person who knows this and still considers a householder's life to be good? Who would willingly bind themselves with the shackles of a home? It is said, "Wives are the cause of humiliation, relatives are a bondage, worldly pleasures are poison. What is this delusion of people? They have hope for friendship in those who are actually their enemies."

Knowing that association with worldly beings is like getting stuck in a great big mud, a wise person should avoid contact with them. He should not be proud of the respect and worship he receives, because pride is a subtle, sharp thorn that is very difficult to remove.

Page #189:
---------------------------
-
This is a study of the Vaitaliya, which means to abandon the worship, respect, and honor given by others, considering it a great obstacle to good conduct and progress. If even worship and respect are obstacles to good work and progress, then what to say of the objects of the senses, such as words, etc.? They are extremely obstructive. The wise man should remove this subtle, very fine, and difficult-to-remove thorn, the remedy for which is being told further.
A monk should wander alone, sleep alone, and be absorbed in meditation.
Commentary: A monk should wander alone, without the help of others, and be alone in terms of material possessions, and free from attachment and aversion in terms of emotions. He should perform practices like Kayotsarga alone. He should sit alone, free from attachment and aversion. He should sleep alone, absorbed in meditation on Dharma, etc. This means that in all situations, whether walking, sitting, standing, or sleeping, he should be absorbed in meditation, free from attachment and aversion. The monk who is virtuous in begging should have the strength of tapasya. He should be silent, and his mind should be absorbed in the spiritual.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Commentary:** If a monk takes shelter in an empty house for any reason, he should not close the door of that house with a shutter or anything else, nor should he move it. If the door or anything else is closed, he should not open it. If someone asks him about dharma or the path, whether he is there or elsewhere, he should not speak words that are blameworthy. Even if he is a Jina Kalpi who has renounced possessions, he should not speak even blameless words. He should not sweep away the grass and debris in the house. No monk who has renounced possessions should make a bed of grass for himself. And what to speak of a blanket? No one else should make a bed of dry grass. ||13||

**Commentary Meaning:** If a virtuous monk takes shelter in an empty house for any reason, he should not close the door of that house with a shutter or anything else, nor should he move it. If the door or anything else is closed, he should not open it. If someone asks him about dharma or the path, whether he is there or elsewhere, he should not speak words that are blameworthy.

Where the sun has set, the monk who has renounced possessions should dwell without disturbance, whether the place is even or uneven. Even if there are mosquitoes, fearful creatures, or reptiles there, he should dwell there.

**Translation:** A man of good character should dwell where the sun has set, without disturbance. He should tolerate the place, whether it is even or uneven, favorable or unfavorable. Even if there are mosquitoes, fearful creatures, or reptiles there, he should dwell there.

**Commentary:** The monk should dwell wherever the sun sets, remaining there with kayotsarga (complete relaxation) etc. Where the sun has set, he should dwell without disturbance, like the ocean, which remains undisturbed by crocodiles and other creatures. The monk, knowing the true nature of the world, should tolerate the unevenness of the place, whether it is favorable or unfavorable, for sleeping, sitting, etc., without attachment or aversion. If there are mosquitoes, flies, etc., or fearful creatures like rakshasas, or reptiles, he should tolerate them all without disturbance. ||14||

**Commentary Meaning:** A man devoted to the practice of restraint should dwell wherever the sun sets, remaining there with kayotsarga (complete relaxation) etc. Therefore, it is said that the monk should dwell wherever the sun sets, without being disturbed by trials and tribulations. Just as the ocean remains undisturbed by crocodiles and other creatures, so too should the monk remain undisturbed. The place for sitting and sleeping, etc., may be unfavorable or uneven, or favorable and convenient, but the monk, knowing the true nature of the world, should tolerate it all without attachment or aversion. If there are mosquitoes, flies, etc., or fearful creatures like rakshasas, or reptiles, he should tolerate them all without disturbance.

## The Study of the Vaitalaya

**Verse 15:**

The great sage, dwelling in the empty house, endures the three types of afflictions: those from the animal realm, those from humans, and those from the divine. He does not tremble, not even a hair on his body, even when faced with these afflictions.

**Commentary:**

This verse discusses the endurance of the three types of afflictions. The afflictions from the animal realm are caused by creatures like lions and tigers. The afflictions from humans are caused by both favorable and unfavorable actions, such as respect, rewards, punishment, and beatings. The afflictions from the divine are caused by entities like ghosts, spirits, and gods, and manifest as ridicule, hatred, and suffering. The sage endures all three types of afflictions without being affected by them. This is further emphasized by the statement that not even a hair on his body trembles in fear. The word "adi" (etc.) implies that this includes other afflictions like distorted vision and facial expressions. The phrase "dwelling in the empty house" is symbolic and refers to the sage residing in places like cemeteries, which are considered fearful. The term "Mahamuni" refers to a sage like a Jina.

**Verse 16:**

The sage dwelling in the empty house does not desire life, nor does he seek worship. The fearsome beings approach him, having been subdued by his practice.

**Commentary:**

This verse highlights the detachment of the sage. He does not crave life or seek praise. His practice has subdued even fearsome beings, who now approach him without fear.

Page #192:
---------------------------
The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra Translation - A Sadhu, afflicted by the aforementioned afflictions, obstacles, and hindrances, should not desire life, nor should he seek praise, honor, glory, and renown while being honored and respected. Thus, a Sadhu who is detached from worship, prestige, and life, and who dwells in an empty house, becomes accustomed to enduring fearful afflictions.
Commentary - Even though he is being praised by the terrible afflictions, he should not desire life. The meaning is that he should endure the afflictions while being detached from life. He should not desire praise or excellence by enduring afflictions. Thus, a Sadhu who is detached from life and worship, repeatedly endures the fearful, terrible Shiva-Pisachas, etc., and becomes accustomed to them, approaching their nature. By enduring them, the afflictions arising from cold, heat, etc., become bearable for the mendicant, like a tamed elephant in a stable.
The one who is more advanced, who is fearless, dwells in a secluded place. They call him a Samayika, because he does not show fear to himself.
Commentary - Again, another teaching is given - The one whose soul has been brought near to knowledge, etc., is called Upaneet. The one who is extremely advanced is called Upaneetatar. The one who benefits others, or the one who is a protector of the right path, is called Tayin. The one who serves is called Bhajaman. The one who dwells in a place free from women, animals, and fools is called Vivikt. The omniscient ones call such a Muni a Samayika, because he has a nature of equanimity. It is necessary to understand that such a Muni should behave in the way described earlier, and he should not show fear to himself, meaning he should not be afraid of the afflictions caused by the environment. They call him a Samayika.

Page #193:
---------------------------
The study of the Vaitaliya is as follows: One who is Upaneetatar and who is Taayi-Trayi, Trata, that is, one who is beneficial to oneself and others, or one who is a proper and good caretaker of oneself and others, one who resides in a place forbidden to women, animals, and eunuchs, the omniscient ones have called such a Muni's Samabhav form Samayik Charitra. Here, the word 'Asan' means that which is situated, it is called Asan. Basati etc. are included in it. The Charitra-Sheel Sadhak should make his nature stable in the aforementioned form. One who is not afraid of the adverse effects of Sadhu Parisha and Upsarg, the omniscient ones have called his Samayik Charitra. This should be added here.

Translation - It is not good for a Muni who drinks hot water without cooling it, who is established in Dharma, who is a devotee of Shruta and Charitra-based Dharma, who is ashamed of Asanyam, who is ashamed of unbridled conduct, to have contact with kings etc., to stay in their company, because it breaks the Samadhi of even the advanced virtuous Sadhu.

Commentary - For a Muni, 'Ushnodakatapt-bhojino' means one who drinks hot water that has been boiled three times, or it means that one who drinks hot water without cooling it, the word 'Tapt' is used here to indicate this. One who is established in Shruta and Charitra-based Dharma, who is ashamed of Asanyam, who is disgusted with unbridled conduct, for such a Muni, contact with kings etc. is not good because it leads to harm. For a Muni who follows the conduct prescribed by the scriptures, contact with kings etc. leads to Asamadhi, to inattention, and it destroys the possibility of his Swadhyaya etc. Therefore, the company of kings etc. should be abandoned.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra:

**Verse 19:**

**Shadow:** The mendicant who engages in disputes and speaks harshly, his purpose (moksha) and the path to it (restraint) are destroyed. A wise person should not engage in disputes.

**Meaning:** The one who engages in disputes and speaks harshly, their purpose of liberation and the path to it, restraint, are destroyed. Therefore, a wise and discerning seeker should never engage in disputes.

**Commentary:** To show the faults that should be avoided, the Sutra-maker gives this advice: Dispute is strife, and the one who engages in it is called a disputant. Such a mendicant, who is prone to disputes, speaks harshly or fearfully. For such a person, liberation and restraint, which are the means to it, are destroyed. This means that the great merit earned through long periods of arduous penance is destroyed in an instant by engaging in disputes and speaking words that harm others. As it is said:

"The merit earned through penance, restraint, and celibacy, do not destroy it through disputes, O wise ones."

Therefore, a wise person, who understands the difference between right and wrong, should not even think about engaging in disputes.

**Verse 20:**

**Shadow:** The one who dislikes cold water, has no vows, and avoids actions that bind karma, is called a Samayika by the omniscient ones. The one who does not eat from a householder's vessel is also called a Samayika.

**Meaning:** The mendicant who dislikes cold water, has no vows, and avoids actions that bind karma, is called a Samayika by the omniscient ones. The one who does not eat from a householder's vessel is also called a Samayika.

**Commentary:** Cold water is water that is not boiled. The mendicant who avoids such water is one who avoids unboiled water. Such a mendicant has no vows or commitments that bind karma. The word "lavan" refers to karma, and "avasappina" means one who avoids actions that bind karma. Such a mendicant, who is free from vows and avoids actions that bind karma, is called a Samayika, which means one who is in a state of equanimity.

Page #195:
---------------------------
Jain Terms Preserved:

The Sarvagnas (omniscient ones) have said that the Sadhu (ascetic) who does not eat from the vessels of the householders, such as copper vessels, etc., in the 'Grihamatre' (within the house), is to be associated with Samayika (equanimity) and Mahura (equanimity).

Explanation - The ascetic who has aversion to impure water, who does not consume impure water, who does not perform Prajnapana (confession of faults), who avoids Lava-karma (minor transgressions), i.e., who renounces activities that are the cause of karmic bondage, the Sarvagnas have called such a Shramana (ascetic) as one established in Samayika (equanimity) and Mahura (equanimity).

And the Muni (ascetic) does not get intoxicated, knowing that the broken life (the thread of life) cannot be mended again, yet the ignorant being becomes audacious and commits sins - the foolish one is destroyed by his own evil deeds, just as the granary is filled with grains. Realizing this, the Muni does not indulge in pride and arrogance.

The verses further explain that the wise, who know the secrets of life, have stated that the life of beings, which is broken by the course of time, cannot be mended like a broken thread. Yet, the ignorant person becomes bold and commits sins without any shame. Such an ignorant being is considered sinful due to his evil deeds, just as the granary is filled with grains. Knowing this, the Muni (ascetic) does not indulge in pride, as he realizes that he is also one among those who engage in undesirable activities, but he is the one who is performing virtuous deeds.

Page #196:
---------------------------
The Sutra Kritanga Sutra, Commentary - 'These people are lost in many illusions, driven by delusion. The virtuous one is lost in the fierce (world) by enduring cold and heat with his words.' Translation - People covered in delusion, who practice many kinds of illusions and deceptions, obtain hellish destinies due to their own desires and passions. However, the virtuous, aiming for liberation, remain dedicated to renunciation through their pure and unblemished actions. They endure cold, heat, and everything else with equanimity through their mind, speech, and actions.
Commentary - The text further explains - 'Chanda' refers to their own intentions, which are the sole cause of their descent into evil destinies. 'These people' refers to this world, which is lost in those destinies. For example, some people, blinded by their own intentions, consider the killing of goats and other animals to be a means of righteousness and act accordingly. Others, with the intention of accumulating wealth, engage in trade and other activities, acquiring slaves, servants, money, and grain. Still others, driven by deceit, deceive innocent people by repeatedly sprinkling water on their bodies, touching their ears, and engaging in other such tricks. As the saying goes, "This world is attainable through deceit, not through anything else. Therefore, for the sake of this world, one should even deceive one's own father."
This 'people' is full of deceit, why? Because they are covered by 'moha' (delusion), which is ignorance. This means they are devoid of the ability to distinguish between the good and the bad. Understanding this, the 'Mahatma' (virtuous one) is lost in the 'vikata' (fierce) world, which is the world of actions, liberation, or excellence. This means he is filled with noble qualities. He endures cold and heat, as well as favorable and unfavorable circumstances, with equanimity through his three instruments of action: mind, speech, and body.
Commentary - People obtain different destinies according to their own intentions or results. The sole cause of their descent into evil destinies is their own (unwholesome) intentions or thoughts. There are many people who consider the killing of goats and other animals to be a means of righteousness according to their own principles. They act in this way with great audacity. There are many other people who, for the sake of their own groups and other purposes, accumulate slaves, servants, wealth, and grain. There are many individuals who repeatedly sprinkle water on their bodies, touch their ears, and engage in other such deceptive practices. Through these deceitful activities, they deceive innocent people. They say that this world is attainable through deceit. 'Kukkuta' (cock) here is used to symbolize deceitful actions. According to them, no action takes place without deceit or trickery. Therefore, for worldly gain, one should even engage in deceitful behavior towards one's own father. These people are full of deceit because they are covered by the ignorance of delusion. This is why they are devoid of the knowledge to distinguish between the good and the bad. Knowing this, the virtuous one understands the futility of such deception and remains dedicated. This means he is filled with noble qualities. He endures cold, heat, favorable and unfavorable circumstances with equanimity through his mind, speech, and body.
'Just as the undefeated warrior shines with his skillful eyes, so too, having taken hold of the present, we do not fear the Kali Yuga, the Treta Yuga, nor the Dvapara Yuga.'
( 168

Page #197:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Vaitaliya Study Translation -** Just as a gambler who is undefeated in the game of dice - who does not lose to anyone - plays the game of dice and takes possession of the place called "Krit" (Satyuga), which is considered the best in gambling, and does not take possession of the places called Kaliyuga, Dwapara, or Treta; in the same way, a wise man accepts and embraces the supreme, all-knowing, and benevolent religion, leaving aside all other paths.

**Commentary -** Even though the victory of this gambler is considered disgraceful, because even a great victory in gambling is condemned by the virtuous and is the cause of misfortune, it is disgraceful. The text clarifies this by saying that he is undefeated due to his skill and is not defeated by anyone. Just as a skilled gambler, playing with dice or pawns, takes possession of the fourth place, "Krit," by winning, and remains there, so too, he, having won, does not take possession of Kaliyuga, Dwapara, or Treta.

**Commentary Meaning -** A person whose victory or win is a cause of reproach and who is condemned by people is called "Ku-jaya." "Ku-jaya" means a gambler. Even if a gambler wins a lot in gambling, he is condemned by men because victory in gambling is the cause of misfortune. Therefore, he is reprehensible. The author of the text uses the adjective "unconquered" for the gambler. His meaning is that a gambler who is not defeated by other gamblers due to his skill in the art of gambling is called "unconquered." A skilled gambler in the art of gambling, playing with dice or pawns, wins the fourth place, which is called "Krit." He achieves the greatest success, and it is a sign of his victory. Thus, playing the game, the gambler becomes victorious by the influence of the place called "Krit." He then does not win the other three places. The three yugas, Kaliyuga, Dwapara, and Treta, are taken here as an analogy. It should be known that "Krit" means Satyuga.

**Thus, in this world, people embrace that religion which is supreme.**
**They consider it the best, like a skilled gambler who takes possession of the "Krit" place, leaving aside all others.**

**Commentary -** The text further explains that just as a gambler, having won, takes possession of the best place, the fourth place, in the same way, in this world, among human beings, the religion that is spoken of by the Triyana (the all-knowing, the savior of all), which is characterized by patience, etc., or which is known as "Shruta-Charitra," has no superior. It is the best, and therefore, accept it wholeheartedly, without any hesitation. The text further illustrates this with an example: just as a gambler takes possession of "Krit" (which means Satyuga), the fourth place, leaving aside the other places, Kaliyuga, etc.

Page #198:
---------------------------
The wise one, even if virtuous, should abandon the remaining worldly attachments, such as the influence of householders, bad advice, and those who are not part of the path, and embrace the complete, great, and supreme Dharma. This is the meaning. ||24||

Commentary: The essence of the example is explained as follows: A skilled gambler accepts only the best fourth die, the "four," considering it the means to victory. Similarly, in this human world, consider the supreme Dharma, rooted in scripture and character, imbued with qualities like patience and forgiveness, as the only definite benefit and good, as it is taught by the omniscient Lord, the protector of all beings.

The author of the scripture then presents the same point as a conclusion: A gambler, while playing, accepts only the fourth position, called "Krita," abandoning the first, second, and third. Similarly, a discerning virtuous person, abandoning householders who give bad advice, those who preach false doctrines, and those who are outside the path, and rejecting the principles they advocate, should embrace the greatest Dharma taught by the omniscient one and follow it.

The Aryasudharma Swami, addressing his main disciples, Jambū and others, says: "The worldly pleasures, the objects of the senses, are called 'Grāmadharma' (worldly duties) for humans. These are difficult to overcome. I have heard from the first Tirthankara, Lord Ṛṣabha, and from Lord Mahāvīra, that those who abandon these worldly pleasures and desires, and strive with awakened effort in the pursuit of restraint, are the followers of the Dharma as exemplified by Lord Mahāvīra." ||25||

Commentary: The author of the scripture further instructs: "Uttara" means "principal" or "difficult to overcome." What is difficult to overcome? It is difficult for humans to overcome, because they are the ones who deserve instruction. Who are they? They are the "Grāmadharma," the worldly duties, which include things like words and sexual pleasure. Thus, the omniscient ones have called these worldly duties "Uttara." I have heard this from the past, and this is all that has been said before and will be said in the future. This is what the first Tirthankara, the son of the sun, taught his sons, and this is what the followers of the path, like Aryasudharma Swami, teach their disciples. Therefore, I have heard this, and it is impeccable. The word "yasmin" (in which) indicates the fifth or seventh case, meaning those who have abandoned the worldly duties and have risen through restraint, are the followers of the Dharma of Ṛṣabha Swami, Vardhamāna Swami, or whoever is related to them. They are the followers of the Dharma established by the Tirthankaras." ||25||

Page #199:
---------------------------
(Study of Vaitaliya) If it is not there, then this impregnability applies to everyone. Who is impregnable? It is said - Gramdharma is impregnable. 'Shabda'
etc. subjects and Abrahmacharya etc. are called Gramdharma. Therefore, Aryasudharma says that I have heard this. Tirthankaras have been advocating that Gramdharma is impregnable. All this which was previously advocated, was elucidated by Lord Rishabhdev, the son of Nabhi, addressing his sons. Thereafter, Sri Sudharmaswami and other subsequent Ganadharas had explained it to their disciples. Therefore, I have heard this, there is no fault in the indication that has been made. It should be understood like this. Here, in the word 'Jansi-Yasmin', the 'Lyap' is dropped in the karma and the use of the fifth or seventh case is done, according to this, the meaning here is that the man who is detached from these Gramdharmas or subject enjoyments, or here, due to the seventh case being in the meaning of the fifth, its meaning is that those who are detached from these Gramdharmas and are properly established in restraint. They follow the religion propagated by the first Tirthankara Lord Rishabhdev and advocated by the last Tirthankara Lord Mahavira. Its meaning is
Those who follow this, I have said, by the great sage.
They are risen, they are risen, they are enlightening each other in terms of Dharma. ||26||
Shadow - Those who follow this, as said, by the great sage.
They are risen, they are risen, they are enlightening each other in terms of Dharma. ||
Translation - Those men who follow the religion advocated by Lord Mahavira, who is a great sage, of the highest order, a seer, omniscient, born in the Kshatriya clan, are the ones who are risen in the path of sadhana, are properly established, are striving in that direction, they are the ones who, when they are about to deviate from the path of Dharma, inspire each other to remain steadfast in Dharma.
_Commentary - And those men who follow this previously mentioned Dharma, which is characterized by the renunciation of Gramdharma, are said to be doing it, by the knower, the son of the knower, 'Mahaya' - because the knowledge of Mahavira is unparalleled, therefore he is great, and because of his tolerance of favorable and unfavorable adversities, the great sage Sri Vardhamana Swami has advocated Dharma, those who follow it are risen by the establishment of restraint, by the avoidance of Kutirthikas, and by the avoidance of Nihnavadi, they are properly established by the abandonment of the wrong path, it is not the case with others, those who are slanderers, Jamali, etc. - this is the meaning. And they, who follow the aforementioned Dharma, inspire each other, relying on Dharma, or they inspire those who are deviating from Dharma, to return to the right Dharma. ||26||
Commentary meaning - Only knowledge is the subject, it is vast, knowledge is not different from the knower. From this perspective, only knowledge and Mahavira are not really different. Therefore, Lord Mahavira is called great. The knower of the lineage, Lord Vardhamana, who is endowed with such knowledge, has tolerated favorable and unfavorable adversities with tolerance, and has advocated the right Dharma while giving the advice of renunciation of Gramdharmas. Those who follow it, abandon the Dharma advocated by other Tirthankaras, who are the proponents of false doctrines, they are truly established in restraint, properly established in Dharma. Those sadhakas, by Nihnavas - by the proponents of false truths,
( 171

---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states that those who follow the wrong path, the path of false teachings, are far away from the true path. Those who believe in false teachings, those who preach them, and those who follow other doctrines like Jamali, are not far from the wrong path. Only those who are engaged in the true doctrine, the doctrine of **Vitaraga** (free from attachment), practice the true Dharma. They encourage each other to remain steadfast in Dharma and help those who have fallen away from Dharma to return to it.

Do not look back at the objects of the senses that you have experienced in the past. Desire to destroy the **Upadhi** (limiting factor) which is Maya (illusion) and the eight types of Karma. Those who are not attached to the objects of the senses that defile the mind, they know the **Samadhi** (meditation) that is inherent in their true nature.

**Commentary:**

Those who lead beings to suffering or keep them wandering in the cycle of birth and death are called **Pranamaka**. The objects of the senses are called **Pranamaka** because they lead beings to lower realms. One should not remember the objects of the senses that one has experienced in the past, because it leads to great harm. One should not desire to experience them again in the future. One should always contemplate on actions that are beneficial for self-improvement. Why? The scriptures explain that the **Upadhi** is what leads the soul to suffering. The **Upadhi** refers to Maya and the eight types of Karma. The righteous should desire to destroy or eliminate them. Those who are great souls, those who are strong in their self-power, are not attached to the objects of the senses that defile the mind, they do not follow the wrong path, they do not practice the wrong Dharma, and they follow the true path, the path of **Satya Mala** (true Dharma). They know the **Samadhi** or **Dharma Dhyana** (meditation on Dharma) that is inherent in their true nature, which is free from attachment and aversion.

##  Vaitaliya Study - Those who understand and experience it as it is, they alone know what their benefit, welfare or well-being is from all sides - from everywhere. Others do not know.

**Do not be a storyteller, a questioner, or a propagator.**

**Knowing the supreme Dharma, one should be a doer of good deeds and not be possessive.**

**Commentary:**

A restrained, ordained person should not be a storyteller, especially not one who tells stories about worldly matters or those that are against Dharma. He should not be a questioner, answering worldly questions or predicting the future. He should not be a propagator, suggesting ways to bring rain or earn wealth. What should he do then? The commentary explains: "Knowing, understanding, having no answer, being unanswerable, having understood the Dharma of Shruta and Charitra, he should be a doer of good deeds, avoiding unnecessary talk and engaging in righteous actions." This is because the fruit of Dharma is to be found in the avoidance of unnecessary talk and the practice of righteous actions. He should not be possessive, thinking "This is mine, I am its owner."

**Do not praise the hidden, do not boast of your knowledge to the ignorant.**

**Those who have accepted the restraint that destroys the eight karmas, their wisdom is respected in the world. They are the ones who are engaged in Dharma.**

##  **Śrī Sūtrakr̥tāṅga Sūtra**

**Commentary:** The word 'chhanna' refers to Māyā.  Māyā is the act of concealing one's true intentions. A restrained person should not follow Māyā. The word 'cha' in this verse indicates a collection of the following items.  Anything that is universally respected without any objection is called 'praśasya'. This is the name of greed, and one should not be greedy. The word 'utkarṣa' refers to pride.  Those who have a low nature, a low intellectual level, are made arrogant by their caste, wealth, or other sources of pride.  They become like fools. A restrained person should not do this.  'Prakāśa' is the name of anger, because even though it resides within a person, it manifests through changes in facial expressions, eyes, and eyebrows. A restrained person should not be angry.  Those great souls who have renounced these passions, who have abandoned them, are truly devoted to Dharma. They are the devotees of Dharma.  The true knowledge and understanding of these virtuous men is well-known and famous in the world, and they are devoted to Dharma.  Those great souls who have diligently practiced the eightfold restraint, which destroys the eight types of karma, are the devotees of Dharma.  Here, the word 'dhūta' used for karma refers to its being worthy of being dispelled or thrown away.

**Verse 30:**

**Aṇihe sahie susaṁvuḍe dhammatthī uvahāṇavīrie | viharezza samāhiindaie attahiyam khu duheṇa labbahi || 30 ||**

**Asnihaḥ sahitaḥ susaṁvṛtaḥ dharmathī upadhāna vīryaḥ | viharet samāhiteindriyaḥ ātma hitam duḥkhena labhyate ||**

**Translation:** A restrained person should not have any attachment or affection for anything. He should always be engaged in those actions that lead to his own welfare and well-being. He should remain engaged in the practice of Dharma, keeping his senses and mind free from sin. He should display his inner strength in austerity and keep his senses under control, progressing in the practice of restraint, because self-welfare is achieved with great difficulty.

**Commentary:** The word 'sniha' means 'to be attached'. 'Asniha' means 'not attached', meaning free from egotism everywhere.  Or, 'niha' means 'to be destroyed' by external influences. 'Aniha' means 'not destroyed', meaning not defeated by external influences.  Another reading is 'aṇhe', meaning 'without sin', 'nirāvadya', meaning 'blameless', 'anushṭhāyī', meaning 'practitioner'. 'Sahita' means 'associated with', 'associated with what is beneficial'. 'Yukta' means 'united', 'united with knowledge, etc.', 'svhita' means 'beneficial to oneself', 'ātma hita' means 'beneficial to the self'.

##  The Study of the Vaitaliya

This text discusses the practice of *sadanuṣṭhāna* (right conduct) and explains that it involves completely shutting off the senses and the *no-indriyas* (non-sensory faculties) from worldly desires. This means that the *dharma* (righteousness) based on *śruta* (scripture) and *cāritra* (conduct) becomes the sole purpose of life. This is because only the righteous seek *dharma*. A *samyamī* (self-controlled) practitioner should engage in *tapas* (austerity) with great strength and follow the path of *samyama* (self-restraint) with controlled senses. Why is this necessary? Because without *sadanuṣṭhāna*, true happiness cannot be attained in this world of suffering. As it is said:

"This human birth, like the flickering light of a firefly, is extremely rare and difficult to obtain. If one falls into the vast ocean of *saṃsāra* (the cycle of birth and death), it is almost impossible to be rescued."

Just as it is difficult for a needle and a grain of rice to meet in the ocean, so too is it difficult to obtain human birth. And even within this birth, it is even more difficult to be born in an *ārya-kṣetra* (a land of righteousness). Therefore, it is clear that true happiness is hard to achieve in this world of suffering.

Furthermore:

1. Among all beings, those that are mobile are superior. Among them, those with five senses are the best. And among those with five senses, humans are the most excellent.
2. Among humans, those born in a good *deśa* (land) are superior. Among those born in a good *kula* (family) are those of a noble *jāti* (caste). Among those of a noble *jāti*, those with good *rūpa* (appearance) and *samṛddhi* (wealth) are superior. Among those with good *rūpa* and *samṛddhi*, those with *bala* (strength) are the best.
3. Among those with *bala*, those with long *āyuṣka* (lifespan) are superior. Among those with long *āyuṣka*, those with *vijñāna* (knowledge) are the best. Among those with *vijñāna*, those with *samyaktva* (right faith) are superior. And among those with *samyaktva*, those who have attained *śīla* (good conduct) are the most excellent.
4. This is the summary of the path to *mokṣa* (liberation). Many have attained it, and some have yet to attain it.
5. Therefore, strive diligently on the path of *madhumān* (sweetness) and *anadukta* (unspeakable) by establishing yourself in *samādhi* (meditation). Abandoning all attachments, perform your duties with righteousness and always seek the highest good.

**Note:** The term "अणहे" (aṇhe) is a variant reading in the text. It means "one who is not attached" or "one who is free from attachments."

The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra**

Birth has its own characteristics. Even after being born in the human realm, it is extremely auspicious to be born in the land of the Aryas. Even there, the family holds a prominent position. Within that, the caste has its own characteristics, meaning it is a very high thing to be born into a noble family and a noble caste. Even with that, it is even more difficult to attain physical beauty, prosperity, and wealth. If that happens, then gaining strength is a special characteristic. Strength may be attained, but if long life is not obtained, then its usefulness is not fulfilled. Therefore, long life also has its own importance. Within life, the attainment of knowledge is important. Knowledge - the attainment of right faith within the framework of specific knowledge is excellent. When that happens, the attainment of character and the practice of good conduct is excellent. Gradually, attaining these things is the means to liberation. In short, this should be understood. You have attained many things from these substances. Now, a little remains to be attained. Therefore, with a focused mind, you should abandon the company of non-Aryans, those who are not noble, and those who are unrighteous, and always engage in actions that lead good people towards their own welfare.

The alternative reading is 'Avitah', meaning it was not practiced truthfully, as it should be. The reason for this is that self-benefit is very difficult to obtain. || 31 ||
The author of the Agam discusses the fact that Samayik, etc. was never heard before by living beings.
The omniscient Lord Mahavira, the son of knowledge, who sees all the states of the world, has spoken about Samayik, etc. It is certain that living beings never heard it in the past. Even if they heard it, they did not follow it as it should be. In this verse, the alternative reading 'Avitah' is found. According to that, the meaning is that living beings did not practice Samayik, etc., as taught by Lord Mahavira, in its true form, in its proper form, and did not behave accordingly. This is why self-benefit and self-welfare are said to be difficult to obtain for living beings.

Commentary - Again, referring to another teaching, he says - Thus, knowing that self-welfare is very difficult, knowing the great difference of Dharmas, the special Dharma, or the difference of karma, or if 'Mahantar', knowing the opportunity of human, Arya Kshetra, etc., knowing this Jain Dharma, Shruta Charitra, accompanied by welfare, etc., many people, those who are accompanied by knowledge, etc., those who are light-karmic, those who are devoted to the Guru, Acharya, etc., or the Tirthankara, those who follow the teachings, those who follow the prescribed path, those who are free from sinful karmas, those who are spread out, the great ocean, the endless ocean of the world, is called by me, by you, and by other Tirthankaras.

By the practice of knowledge, etc., knowledge, conduct, they have lightened their karmas. Following the path shown by their Guru, Acharya, Tirthankaras, they have renounced sinful karmas, such men have crossed this endless ocean of the world - crossed it. I have told you this. Other Tirthankaras have also said so. Here, the word 'iti' is used in the sense of ending. 'Bravimi' - I speak. This is the same as before, so it should be added.

## Sutra Kritanga Sutra, Chapter 3: Introduction

**Commentary:** This is the beginning of the third section of the Vaitaliya study. The second section has been completed, and now the third section begins. The connection between these two sections is as follows: In the end of the second section, it was stated that those who have renounced sins - evil karmas - cross the ocean of existence. Now, in this section, it will be explained that when a sage encounters trials and tribulations, they should endure them. This is because enduring them leads to the destruction of karmas born from ignorance.

The author of this section states that the purpose of this section is to explain that enduring trials and tribulations leads to the destruction of karmas born from ignorance. Therefore, a sage should endure them. This third section is meant to explain this. Its first sutra is:

**Sutra 1:**

* **Sanskrit:** संवुडकम्मस्स भिक्खुणो, जं दुक्खं पुढे अबोहिए ।
ते संजमओऽवचिजई, मरणं हेच्च वयंति पंडिया ॥१॥
* **Shadow:** संवृत्तकर्मणः भिक्षोः यदुःखं स्पृष्ट मवोधिना ।
तत्संयमतोऽवचीयते मरणं हित्वा व्रजन्ति पंडिताः ॥
* **Translation:** The monk who has restrained his karmas - stopped the influx of the eight types of karmas - experiences suffering due to ignorance. This suffering, through the practice of restraint, diminishes. Wise and discerning individuals, having renounced death, proceed towards liberation.

**Commentary:** The monk who has restrained his karmas - stopped the influx of the eight types of karmas - through the practice of right conduct, wrong views, non-renunciation, carelessness, passions, and enjoyment, experiences suffering due to ignorance. This suffering, through the practice of restraint, diminishes. This means that the karmas bound due to ignorance, through the practice of the seventeen types of restraint as mentioned by the Tirthankaras, diminish and are destroyed every moment. This is similar to how water in a pond, with a blocked entrance, diminishes every day due to the sun's heat. Similarly, the monk who has restrained his karmas, through the practice of restraint, diminishes the karmas accumulated due to ignorance over many lifetimes. Those who have restrained their karmas and practice right conduct, having renounced death - the nature of death, the characteristics of death, the death of birth, old age, and sorrow - proceed towards liberation. Wise and discerning individuals, knowing the difference between right and wrong, say that this is what has been said before.

---------------------------
## Study of Vaitalaya

The eight types of karmas, which are accumulated due to ignorance, causing suffering, non-truth, unfavorable sensations, or pain, are destroyed moment by moment by following or upholding the seventeen types of restraint as taught by the Tirthankaras. This means that in a reservoir where the water inlet is blocked, the accumulated water gradually decreases and dries up due to the sun's rays. Similarly, the karma accumulated over many lifetimes due to ignorance in a seeker who has closed the doors of inflow, who is always vigilant in controlling the tendencies of the senses and passions, is diminished by the practice of restraint. Seekers who are self-controlled and virtuous abandon the cycle of death, the human existence, and attain liberation. Here, by implication, death also includes birth, old age, sorrow, etc., meaning that they are also abandoned, permanently. Those who have the wisdom or knowledge to distinguish between truth and falsehood are called wise. These wise ones, the omniscient, say:

**"Those who are not attached to women are like the liberated ones. One should know that liberation is attained only after abandoning women, the desire for sensual pleasures. Those who have considered sensual pleasures as a disease are like the liberated ones."**

**Commentary:**

These are also not liberated in this very life. The scripture says about them:

**"Those great souls who are approached by those seeking sensual pleasures, or those who approach a sensual man for the same purpose, are called 'vijnāpanā'. 'Vijnāpanā' refers to women. Those virtuous men who are not served by women, or in other words, who have not attained destruction through women, are indestructible due to their non-attachment. They are said to be like liberated men. Although they have not crossed the ocean of samsara, they are still considered liberated because they are devoid of possessions and are not attached to worldly objects like words, etc. Therefore, you should see that liberation is attained after abandoning women. Those who have considered sensual pleasures as a disease, like a sickness, are said to be like liberated men. It is also said:**

**"Those who know the taste of flowers, fruits, wine, meat, and women, are like those who are attached to worldly pleasures. I bow to those who are free from these."**

**Another reading of the third section is: "Those who consider sensual pleasures as a disease, like a sickness, are said to be like liberated men."**

**Commentary:**

The scripture says about those men who do not attain liberation in this very life:

**"Those who are attached to sensual pleasures, who express their desire to someone, or who express their desire to a sensual man, are called 'vijnāpanā'. 'Vijnāpanā' refers to women. Those virtuous men who are not served by women, or in other words, who have not attained destruction through women, are indestructible due to their non-attachment.

##  The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

Having reached the shore of the ocean of the world, due to not being attached, it is known that liberation is attained only after the abandonment of sexual intercourse. Those men who have considered sensual pleasures as disease, are declared to be like liberated men. It is also said - I bow to those men who have understood the juice of flowers and fruits, wine, meat and women as the cause of harm and have abandoned them, who have performed difficult and arduous deeds.

Here, in the third step, the variant reading 'Uddham Tiriyam Ahethaha' is also found, which means that those men who consider the sensual pleasures that exist in the upper-heavenly realms, the intermediate realms, and the lower realms, as equivalent to disease, are like those men who have crossed the ocean of the world.

1. **Aggaṃ Vaṇiyehiṃ Āhiyaṃ, Dhāraṃtī Rāiṇiyā Ihaṃ. Evaṃ Paramā Mahāvvaȳā Akkhāyā U Sarāibhoyaṇā. ||3||**

**Translation:** Kings in this world wear the best jewels and clothes brought by merchants. Similarly, monks wear the five great vows, including the vow of abstaining from food at night, as declared by the Acharyas (teachers).

**Commentary:**  Further explaining the teachings, it is said that 'Aggaṃ' means the best, the main, like jewels, clothes, ornaments, etc. These are brought from other countries by merchants. 'Āhitaṃ' means brought, carried. Kings, like those who are worthy of such things, wear them in this human world. Similarly, these great vows, like jewels, are declared, explained, and implemented by the Acharyas. The virtuous ones wear them, including the vow of abstaining from food at night. The word 'tu' indicates the special quality of the great vows compared to the previous jewels. This means that just as kings are the only ones worthy of the best jewels, similarly, only the great beings, the virtuous ones, are worthy of the great vows, not others.

Vaitālika Adhyayana Chāyā - These are the men who are attached to the pleasures here. They are arrogant like the miserly, and do not know the state of samādhi.

Translation:

The men in this world who are followers of the seven pleasures, who are engrossed in prosperity and grandeur, and who are infatuated with sensual pleasures, are like the miserly and the weak. They boldly indulge in the pursuit of sensual desires. Even when advised, they do not comprehend the importance of spiritual contemplation (dharmādhyāna).

Commentary: The men of inferior nature in this human world, who are distressed by both worldly and other-worldly sufferings, keep following the pleasures of this world. They are attached to the taste of prosperity and grandeur. They are intensely desirous of sensual pleasures, like the miserly and the weak, who are conquered by the senses. They boldly indulge in the enjoyment of worldly pleasures. Or, those who think that not properly observing the vigilance vows (samiti) is a small fault, and that our restraint cannot be destroyed by that - this is their negligence. In this way, they defile the spotless restraint, like a jewel-studded courtyard. Even when advised, such people do not understand the importance of spiritual contemplation (dharmādhyāna) and the like.

Vāhena yathāvakṣite, abalo bhavati gavaṃ pracodyate |
Sa antaśo alpasthāmā, nātivahaty abalo visīdati || 5 ||

Translation:
Just as a weak ox, when prodded by the driver with a whip or goad, becomes powerless, and being of little strength, is unable to traverse the difficult path and suffers.

Commentary: Again, explaining another teaching, he says: "By the driver" - that is, by the hunter - "as" - just as - "the animal" - such as a deer - "being struck by various snares and traps, even though urged on by the call of life, becomes powerless" - incapable of moving - "due to the fatigue that has arisen." Or, "the carrier" - the cart-driver - while transporting the "ox" - even though prodding it with various goads and whips - "it becomes powerless" - incapable of traversing the difficult path and the like. "And he, being of little strength," - being weak - "is unable to bear the load" - and sinks in the mud and the like at that very place.

Page #210:
---------------------------
Shri Sutrakritanga Sutram. Commentary - The author of the scripture, now giving another discourse on the same subject, says -

When a deer or other animal is severely wounded, exhausted, and weakened by the use of traps, snares, and other devices by the hunter, then even though it is urged in various ways, it cannot move or even make the sound 'vah' due to fatigue. This indicates the state of the charioteer. Just as a charioteer is unable to properly drive the chariot, and keeps whipping the ox to make it move forward, similarly, the weakened ox, due to its debility, cannot traverse the uneven, hilly, and rugged terrain, and despite its best efforts and anguish, remains incapable of bearing that burden. It gets stuck in the mud and other difficult places, and becomes distressed.

Evam kamesan.a viru ajasue payahe santhavam.
Kami kame n.a kamae laddhevaavi aladdha kan.hui.

Translation:
Thus, the wise should renounce attachment to sensual desires, even if they are presently enjoyed. The one who is desirous should not desire the objects of desire, whether obtained or not obtained.

Commentary: The author explains the essence of the previous example. Just as the wise, skilled person who is engrossed in the pursuit of sense objects cannot easily renounce them, even if he thinks of doing so someday, and remains weak like the ox unable to leave the difficult path, similarly, one should not desire the objects of desire, whether obtained or not obtained. The person of great fortitude should become indifferent and dispassionate towards the enjoyed sense objects, just as Jambusavami, Vajrasavami and the awakened young monk.

## Study of the Vaitaliya

It is so.
Lest you fall into evil after death, detach your soul from worldly pleasures.
And teach it that the man who practices evil, devoid of good means and righteous conduct, grieves greatly, laments, and cries out. ||7||

**Commentary:**

Why should one renounce worldly desires? To answer this doubt, the scripture says: "Lest you fall into evil after death or in another birth due to attachment to worldly pleasures, and suffer the consequences of evil thoughts and actions." Therefore, detach yourself from worldly attachments and abandon them. Teach your soul to be disciplined and follow the path of righteousness. O soul! The one who engages in evil deeds, such as violence, falsehood, and theft, falls into a terrible state, suffers greatly, and is tormented by righteous beings. He is born as a bird or animal, tormented by hunger and other pains, and cries out in agony. He laments and cries, saying, "Mother! I am dying! There is no one to protect me now. I have committed many sins. Who will give refuge to this sinner?" Such are the sufferings of the evil-doer. Therefore, one should not indulge in worldly pleasures. Teach your soul this lesson. ||7||

This life is fleeting, even a hundred years pass quickly like a young man.
Understand that this life is a temporary abode, and only greedy fools are intoxicated by worldly pleasures. ||8||

##  The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Commentary:**  In this world, what else is there to speak of? First, look at your own life.  It is the source of all happiness, yet it is impermanent.  Like the waves of the ocean, which rise and fall constantly, so too does our lifespan diminish moment by moment.  Even a person with a lifespan of a hundred years, whether they die of old age or due to some unforeseen circumstance, will eventually perish.  Compared to the vastness of time, a hundred years is like a single blink of an eye.  Therefore, understand that this world is like a temporary dwelling.  Even with such a short lifespan, people with a low nature are engrossed in sensual pleasures, becoming intoxicated and attached to them.  As a result, they are destined for the realms of suffering, such as hell.  ||8||

**Commentary Meaning:**  In this world, what else is there to speak of? First, look at your own life.  It is the source of all happiness, yet it is impermanent.  Like the waves of the ocean, which rise and fall constantly, so too does our lifespan diminish moment by moment.  Even a person with a lifespan of a hundred years, whether they die of old age or due to some unforeseen circumstance, will eventually perish.  Compared to the vastness of time, a hundred years is like a single blink of an eye.  Therefore, understand that this world is like a temporary dwelling.  Even with such a short lifespan, people with a low nature are engrossed in sensual pleasures, becoming intoxicated and attached to them.  As a result, they are destined for the realms of suffering, such as hell.  ||8||

**Verse:**  Those who are attached to violence and other harmful actions, who inflict suffering upon themselves and are cruel to others, will dwell in the realms of suffering for a long time.  Even if they perform some good deeds, they will be reborn as Asuras (demons) or low-level deities. ||9||

**Commentary:**  There are some who, blinded by ignorance, are deeply attached to violence and other harmful actions.  They inflict suffering upon themselves and are cruel to others.  Such individuals will be reborn in the realms of suffering, such as hell, for a long time.  Even if they perform some good deeds, they will be reborn as Asuras (demons) or low-level deities. ||9||

Vaitālikya adhyayana are destructive. They go to the places-worlds of sinful beings like hell etc. They reside there for a long time. Even if they attain divinity due to the influence of childish penance-ignorant asceticism etc., they go only to the demonic direction, i.e., they become low-class mischievous devas who are servants-attendants of other devas.

"This life is not worth sanctifying, yet the ignorant people become bold (in committing sins). Seeing what done in the present, who has come to the other world?" (10)

Commentary: Further, the omniscient persons have said that this life cannot be sanctified or made fit for spiritual practice, yet the ignorant people boldly engage in unrighteous activities. They say that we are only concerned with the pleasures of the present, and who has seen the other world - who has come here after seeing the other world.

The meaning is that even though the life of living beings is so established, the ignorant people, due to lack of discrimination, engage in unrighteous conduct with audacity, i.e., they become very shameless in committing sins. And the ignorant person, being prompted by others, replies with the pride of false scholarship, that the present time alone is meaningful, because the objects of the past and future are non-existent, the past being destroyed and the future not yet arisen. Therefore, only this world exists in reality, not the other world. (Who has come here after seeing the other world?)

The English translation preserving the Jain terms is as follows:

The Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra has come from the Paraloka (the world beyond). The author has also recited a verse - "O beautiful one! O one with a lovely body! Consume, drink, and enjoy the best of substances. What is gone is not yours. O innocent one! The lost thing does not return, and this body is merely a collection of the five Mahabhutas (great elements). Therefore, O virtuous one! This person is only as much as is visible, the Atma (soul), and the Loka (world). But the ignorant and unlearned people, just as they imagine the footprint of a human on the earth to be that of a wolf, similarly..."

Adakkhuvadakkhuvahiyam, (tam) saddahasu adakkhudamsana. Handi hu sunirruddhadamsano mohanijjena kadena kammuna. (11)

Translation: "O one without sight, accept the teachings proclaimed by the All-Seeing, All-Knowing Bhagavan (Lord). Understand that those who accept the views of the non-omniscient are obstructed in their right vision by the Karma (actions) done under the influence of Mohaniya (delusion)."

Page #215:
---------------------------
This is similar to the study of Vaitaliya. Such a man is addressed and said, "O blind man! You who are devoid of the knowledge of action and inaction due to accepting only direct perception as evidence, become devoted to the Agamas declared by the omniscient. By accepting only direct perception as evidence, all conduct disappears, then what will be your own existence? Because by accepting only direct perception as evidence, even conduct like who is whose father, who is whose son, cannot stand. You who accept the philosophy stated by the non-omniscient! First of all, you are only a witness to the material that is in front of you, and even then you believe in the philosophy that accepts only direct perception as evidence. In such a situation, if you do not accept the Agamas declared by the omniscient, you will be devoid of the discrimination of action and inaction and become like a blind man. Or, O man of faith in other philosophies! Whether you are unskilled or skilled, or whether you are skilled or unskilled, you should have faith in the path of benefit and self-welfare obtained by the man who is the possessor of the philosophy of only direct perception and only knowledge. The meaning is that whether a man is skilled or unskilled, he should have faith in the beneficial and welfare-giving philosophy declared by the omniscient. Or, O one who does not see the past and the future! Become devoted to what the omniscient, who sees the past, present, future, and subtle objects, has declared. O one who does not see the unseen! O one who does not see the unskilled! You who follow the philosophy declared by the non-omniscient! Abandon your insistence and have faith in the path spoken by the omniscient. This is the meaning.

It is said, why does a being not have faith in the path spoken by the omniscient, which you are instructing in this way? Explaining the reason, the Agamkar says - the word 'hu' in this verse is used in the sense of a figure of speech. The man whose philosophy, right knowledge, is completely obstructed is called obstructed philosophy. Then the question arises, by whom has his knowledge been obstructed? Then the question arises, by whom has his knowledge been obstructed? Solving it, they say that the being whose knowledge is obstructed by the false philosophy, etc., and the self-created karmas of knowledge-obscuring, etc., from which he becomes deluded by attachment, does not have faith in the path spoken by the omniscient. Therefore, the Agamkar inspires him to have faith in that path.

Dukhi mohe puno puno, nivvindej silogpuyanam.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra:

**Verse 12:**

The one who, due to ignorance, repeatedly performs actions that lead to suffering and endlessly wanders in the ocean of Samsara, should abandon such ignorance.  By rising through right understanding, one should develop aversion, abandon self-praise and flattery, and also avoid offerings and material gains.  Following this path, one should live with the well-intentioned, be endowed with knowledge, and be restrained.  A renunciant, free from harming other beings, should see all living beings as equal to oneself, experiencing the same joy and sorrow.  One should protect all beings as equal to oneself.

**Commentary:**

The author of the text explains further:

Actions that lead to the arising of non-virtuous karma are called suffering, or the cause of suffering.  What is unpleasant or bad for a being is considered suffering.  The being who experiences suffering is called a suffering being.  A suffering being repeatedly becomes deluded by ignorance, lacking the ability to discern the virtuous and non-virtuous.  This means that a being, afflicted by the arising of non-virtuous karma, becomes deluded by ignorance and performs actions that lead to further suffering.  They wander in the endless ocean of Samsara.  Therefore, a wise person should abandon such ignorance and rise through right understanding.  By relying on right knowledge, they should become a practitioner of right conduct, abandoning self-praise, flattery, and material gains.  

Following this path, they should live with the well-intentioned, be endowed with knowledge, and be restrained.  Such a renunciant should see all beings as equal to oneself, experiencing the same joy and sorrow.  This means that a renunciant should consider all beings as equal to oneself, experiencing the same joy and sorrow, and protect them from harm.

**Verse 13:**

Even if one lives in a house, one should gradually become free from harming living beings.  One should cultivate equanimity towards all beings.  Such a person of good conduct will attain the realm of the gods.

**Commentary:**

Even if a person lives in a house, they should gradually embrace the teachings of the Shramanas and abstain from harming living beings.  They should cultivate equanimity towards all beings.  Such a person of good conduct will attain the realm of the gods.  

This verse emphasizes that even a householder can attain liberation by following the path of non-violence and equanimity.  The text further clarifies that even a householder who practices the five great vows can attain liberation.

Page #217:
---------------------------
The study of the Vaitaliya, according to the principles laid down by the omniscient, is one who holds equality and sameness towards all, from the virtuous householder to the one-sensed beings. Such a man, even while being a householder, attains the realm of Indra and other gods. What to say of those virtuous ones who are the keepers of the five great vows, who are the great possessors of the power of the great soul and self-effort.

**Verse 14**

**Shadow:** Having heard the teachings of the Lord, one should strive for truth there.
**Translation:** Having heard the teachings of the Lord, one should strive for truth there.
**Commentary:** Having heard the teachings of the Lord, one should strive for truth there.

**Verse 15**

**Shadow:** Knowing all, one should abide in the strength of dharma and artha.
**Translation:** Knowing all, one should abide in the strength of dharma and artha.
**Commentary:** Knowing all, one should abide in the strength of dharma and artha.

Page #218:
---------------------------
The Sutra of the Sri Sutra Kritanga is the topic.  The one who has strength in austerity is called "Ani-guhit Balaviryya" which means "unconcealed strength".  The one who is guarded in mind, speech, and body is called "Supranihit Yoga" which means "well-directed yoga".  The one who is united with knowledge and the like, should always strive for the highest good, both for oneself and others.  What is the special characteristic of such a person?  Therefore, it is said that the highest, the most excellent, the long, the eternal liberation is the goal.  Therefore, the one who desires this goal should be endowed with the aforementioned special characteristics. ||15||

Commentary:  A virtuous person should know the objects that are worthy of renunciation and acceptance, and should embrace the path of Dharma, which is in the form of complete restraint, as taught by the omniscient ones.  He should consider Dharma as the purpose and goal of his life, or he should consider Dharma as the only real substance for life, because everything else besides Dharma is harmful and useless for the soul.  "Upadhana" is the name of austerity.  A virtuous person should not diminish his strength in it, but should use his self-effort to the fullest extent.  He should be guarded in mind, speech, and body.  In other words, he should maintain his mental, physical, and verbal yogas free from the non-virtuous and directed towards the virtuous.  He should always strive for the welfare of himself and others, being united with knowledge and the like.  Asking a question, it is further said, "How should he do this?"  The one who is the longest is called "Parmayat", and the one who is present in all times is called "Parmayat".  That is liberation.  A virtuous person should always desire liberation and be connected with these characteristics, which have been mentioned before.

Wealth, livestock, and relatives, the ignorant person considers them as his refuge.  He thinks that these will protect him from suffering, that they will protect me, and I will protect them.  But the reality is that they cannot protect him.

Wealth, livestock, and relatives, the ignorant person considers them as his refuge.  These cannot protect me, nor is there any refuge in them.

Commentary:  Again, another teaching is given:  "Wealth" refers to money, grain, gold, etc.  "Livestock" refers to elephants, horses, cows, buffaloes, etc.  "Relatives" refers to one's own people, such as parents, children, spouses, etc.  The ignorant person considers this wealth, livestock, and relatives as his refuge.  This is what is shown:  "My wealth, livestock, and relatives will be used for enjoyment.  I will be in them through earning, maintaining, protecting, and resolving problems."  Thus, the ignorant person thinks, but he does not know that the purpose for which he desires wealth is his body, which is perishable.  Moreover, "Wealth, along with its attendants, is perishable, subject to disease, old age, and decay.  What is the connection of a perishable body with wealth, which is also perishable?"  Similarly,

"Thousands of parents, hundreds of sons and daughters,
They come and go in every birth,
Who is the mother or father, even?"

This is what is said:  Wealth, etc., cannot protect in the world in any way.  It does not protect from hell, nor is there any refuge for the one who is afflicted by attachment, etc. ||16||

Commentary:
Wealth, grain, gold, and silver are called "Vitt".  Elephants, horses, cows, buffaloes, etc. are called "Pashu".  Parents, children, spouses, etc. are called "Jnati".  The ignorant creature considers this wealth, grain, etc.

Page #219:
---------------------------
The study of Vaitaliya considers material things as its refuge.  Illustrating this point, it says: A being devoid of knowledge thinks that wealth, animals, and family members will be useful for worldly enjoyment and consumption. I will earn wealth and support them, eliminating all troubles and destroying them. In reality, the body for which wealth and prosperity are desired is perishable - fleeting, the fool does not know this. It is said that wealth and prosperity are inherently fickle and unstable, and this body is mortal due to illness and old age - disease and old age destroy it. How long can the relationship between these two transient things last? Mother and father have been in countless births. Sons and wives have also been hundreds of times. This happens in every birth. Who is really whose mother and who is the father? The Agamkar says the same thing again: In the world, wealth etc. can never protect anyone. When a being falls into hell, overwhelmed by attachment etc., there is no refuge anywhere, no one can save him.

**17.  When suffering comes to a being, or when he is about to die, he goes alone to the next world.  Therefore, the wise do not consider anyone as their refuge.**

**Commentary:** This is what was said before: When suffering arises from the ripening of unwholesome karma accumulated in the past, the being experiences it alone.  Neither relatives nor wealth can do anything.  Thus, it is said: "A sick person lies in the midst of his family, but he suffers alone.  Can his family cure his disease or destroy it?"  Or, when a being's lifespan is about to end due to the causes of death, or when he is about to die, he goes alone to the next world.  The wise, who know the true nature of the world, do not consider anyone as their refuge, even for a moment.  Why?  Because no one can truly protect them.  Thus, it is said: "A being's birth, death, and good and bad destinies in the cycle of existence are all his own.  Therefore, he must work for his own benefit in the present moment."  "One alone performs karma, and one alone experiences its fruit.  One alone is born, one alone dies, and one alone goes to the next world."

The Agamkar explains this fact.

When suffering comes to a being due to the ripening of unwholesome karma accumulated in the past, he alone experiences it.  At that time, wealth, riches, or family members cannot help him in the least.  Therefore, it is said: "A sick person, afflicted by disease, lies among his family members, but he suffers alone.  Can his family cure his disease or destroy it?"

Page #220:
---------------------------
The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra states that one suffers alone. Relatives cannot lessen or eliminate one's suffering. When a being's lifespan is destroyed, fulfilled, or ends due to the causes of action, and death arrives, one goes to the afterlife alone. From there, one returns to this world alone. A wise and discerning person understands the nature of the world as it truly is. They do not consider wealth or anything else as their protector, let alone a complete protector. It is said that in this world, birth and death are solitary experiences. In this cycle of existence, one traverses good and bad paths alone. Therefore, until death, one should focus on self-benefit and self-welfare. One performs actions alone and experiences their fruits alone. One is born alone and dies alone, and one goes to the afterlife alone.

All beings, shaped by their own actions, are afflicted by unseen suffering. They wander, terrified and deceitful, driven by birth, old age, and death.

Commentary: All beings dwelling in the belly-like cavity of the world wander through the world. They are shaped by their own actions, such as the karma of obscuring knowledge, and are arranged in subtle and gross, sufficient and insufficient, one-sense, etc., states. They are afflicted by unseen, unmanifest suffering, such as headaches, which is a sign of the suffering. They are also afflicted by manifest suffering, which is unbearable in nature. They wander like a water wheel, terrified and deceitful due to their wicked actions. They are driven by birth, old age, and death, suffering from the pain of conception, etc.

## Study of the Vaitalaya

This very moment, know this, it is not easy to attain enlightenment. Thus, the Jinas have said, this is the essence. || 19 ||

**Translation:**

The Jinas have said that enlightenment is not easily attained, even knowing this very moment. Thus, one should contemplate with the knowledge of self-benefit, that this human life is the only opportunity for the practice of liberation. The omniscient beings have said that enlightenment - perfect knowledge - is not easily attained, it is not easily found. The first Tirthankara, Lord Rishabha, gave this teaching, and the other Tirthankaras also expounded the same.

**Commentary:**

The word "kincha" here indicates the immediacy of the situation. Knowing this moment, characterized by the elements of substance, space, time, and state, one should perform the appropriate actions. For example, the substance is characterized by being mobile, having five senses, being born in a good family, and being human. The space is characterized by the twenty-five and a half Janapadas of the Aryadesha. The time is characterized by the descending time cycle and the fourth Arka, etc., which are conducive to attaining Dharma. The state is characterized by listening to Dharma, developing faith in it, practicing good conduct, the destruction and cessation of karmas that cover the soul, and the enthusiasm for attaining liberation. Knowing this moment, this opportunity, and understanding that enlightenment, characterized by attaining perfect vision, is not easily attained, one should act accordingly to attain it. For those who have not practiced Dharma, enlightenment is difficult to attain. As it is said, "Having obtained enlightenment, you do not act accordingly, and you seek what is not yet attained. What price will you pay to obtain that other enlightenment?"

Therefore, one who is endowed with knowledge, etc., should contemplate that enlightenment is very difficult to attain, even after a long period of time characterized by the reversal of half of the subtle particles. The alternative reading is "ahiyasaye," which means to patiently endure the trials and tribulations that arise. The Jinas, the conquerors of attachment and aversion, have taught this principle to their sons on the Ashtapadi mountain, and other Jinas have also said the same. || 19 ||

**Commentary on the Commentary:**

The word "ina" in the verse indicates something that is present and near. Therefore, understanding this moment, characterized by substance, space, time, and state, as an opportunity for the practice of liberation, one should perform the appropriate actions. The substance is characterized by being mobile, having five senses, being born in a good family, and being human. The space is characterized by the twenty-five and a half Janapadas of the Aryadesha. The time is characterized by the descending time cycle and the fourth Arka, etc., which are conducive to attaining Dharma. The state is characterized by listening to Dharma, developing faith in it, practicing good conduct, the destruction and cessation of karmas that cover the soul, and the enthusiasm for attaining liberation. Knowing this moment, this opportunity, and understanding that enlightenment, characterized by attaining perfect vision, is not easily attained, one should act accordingly to attain it. For those who have not practiced Dharma, enlightenment is difficult to attain. As it is said, "Having obtained enlightenment, you do not act accordingly, and you seek what is not yet attained. What price will you pay to obtain that other enlightenment?"

Therefore, one who is endowed with knowledge, etc., should contemplate that enlightenment is very difficult to attain, even after a long period of time characterized by the reversal of half of the subtle particles. The alternative reading is "ahiyasaye," which means to patiently endure the trials and tribulations that arise. The Jinas, the conquerors of attachment and aversion, have taught this principle to their sons on the Ashtapadi mountain, and other Jinas have also said the same. || 19 ||

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Verse 20:**

"The monks, those who have been in the past, and those who will come in the future, all these virtuous ones, those who follow the Dharma of Kashyapa, have spoken of these qualities."

**Commentary:**

"This is what is said: 'O monks, the omniscient one instructs his disciples, those who have been in the past, the omniscient Jinas, and those who will come in the future.' He distinguishes them as virtuous ones, those with good vows. This is said to mean that their Jinaship also comes from their virtuousness. All of them have spoken of these qualities, which have been mentioned before. There is no difference of opinion among the omniscient ones. They are all followers of the Dharma, as practiced by Kashyapa, Rishabha Swami, or Vardhamana Swami. This shows that there is only one path to liberation, which is based on right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct."

**Verse 21:**

"One should not kill any living beings, even with mind, speech, or body. One should be engaged in self-benefit, and not be attached to heaven or other desires. By following this path, countless beings have attained Siddhatva and liberation. They exist in the present and will exist in the future."

**Commentary:**

"He mentions the qualities that have been mentioned before. He says, 'If one kills living beings with mind, speech, or body, or by causing them to be killed, or by consenting to their killing, then this is the first great vow.' Because this is a characteristic of the vow, the other vows should also be understood in this way. 'Self-benefit' means that one should not be attached to heaven or other desires. 'Unattached' means that one should not be attached to the senses, mind, speech, or body. One who is like this will surely attain liberation. This is what is shown."

## The Study of the Vaitaliya

By following the path of the Infinite, countless Siddhas have become free from all karmas and have attained special places, or are attaining them in the present time, or will attain them in the future by following this path. There is no other path to Siddhi. ||21||

**Commentary:** The Agamkar, referring to the qualities mentioned earlier, says: One should not kill any of the ten types of living beings through mind, speech, or body, or through action or approval. This is the first great vow. The remaining four great vows should also be understood through this characteristic. The one who is engaged in the welfare of the soul, the one who seeks the welfare of the soul, should abstain from desires or intentions for attaining heaven, etc. He should keep his senses, mind, speech, and body hidden and protected from evil deeds. The one who does this will surely attain Siddhi.

Explaining this, it is said that by following the aforementioned path, countless beings have destroyed their karmas and attained Siddhi. In other words, they have gained a unique and unparalleled place. Even in the present time, those who are eligible to attain Siddhi attain it through the means mentioned earlier, they attain liberation. In the future too, countless beings will attain Siddhi by following that path. There is no other path to Siddhi.

Thus, the Anuttara-nani, the Anuttara-dansi, the holder of the Anuttara-jnana and Anuttara-darshan, the Arhat, the Jnatputra, the Bhagavan Mahavira, preached this in the city of Vaishali. This is what I say.

**Commentary:** This is what Sudharmaswami, Jambuswami, and others, teach their disciples. Thus, the Rishibhaswami, following the three-fold method mentioned earlier, has declared this for his sons. There is no higher principle than this, therefore it is Anuttara. That knowledge is Anuttara-jnana, and he possesses it, therefore he is Anuttara-jnani. He is also Anuttara-darshi, because he understands the nature of the general and the specific. To show the soul as the basis of knowledge, he says, "Anuttara-jnana-darshan-dhara," which means the basis of knowledge and vision that is different from ordinary knowledge and vision. The Arhat, the one worthy of worship by Indra and others, the Jnatputra, the Vardhaman Swami, or the Bhagavan Rishibhaswami, possessing qualities like wealth, etc., preached this in the city of Vaishali. Rishibhaswami is called Vaishalik because he was born in the Vaishali clan. It is also said:

"Whose mother is Vaishali, whose clan is Vaishali, whose speech is Vaishali, he is the Vaishali Jina."

Thus, this Jina is called Vaishalik. The word "iti" signifies the end of the statement. The meaning is the same as before. ||22||

**Commentary:** The Agamkar explains what the Aryas Sudharma, Sri Jambu, etc., say to their disciples.

"The Bhagavan, the son of the Nayaputta, preached in Vaishali." ||22|| This is what I say.

Thus, he declared that he is the Anuttara-jnani, the Anuttara-dansi, the holder of the Anuttara-jnana and Anuttara-darshan.

The Arhat, the Jnatputra, the Bhagavan Vaishalik, has declared this. || This is what I say. ||

Page #224:
---------------------------
The Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra, the first of the three sermons, contains the teachings given by the first Tirthankara, Lord Rishabhdev, to his sons.  Anuttar refers to that which is supreme and beyond comparison. Anuttar knowledge is the highest form of knowledge.  The Lord possessed such Anuttar knowledge, hence he was an Anuttar Jnani.  Similarly, he was an Anuttar Darshani.  He was Tat-svabhav, the knowledge that illuminates both the general and the specific.  Now, to refute Buddhism, we explain that the basis of knowledge is the Jiva, meaning the Jiva is the holder of knowledge.  The Lord was the holder of Anuttar knowledge and Darshan.  This implies that the Lord was the basis of knowledge and Darshan, distinct from himself.  Lord Mahavira, the known son and representative of Lord Rishabh, who was worshipped by Indra and other gods, gave us his teachings in the city of Vishala or Vaishali.  Vaishali can also be written as Vaishalik, meaning born into a great lineage.  It is said that Lord Mahavira's mother, Trishala, was Vaishala, a woman of supreme good fortune.  Her lineage was vast and extremely high.  Her words and teachings were vast and extremely excellent.  Therefore, he is called the Vaishalik (Jin-Jineshwara) Tirthankara.  Here, the word "iti" signifies completion.  The word "bravimi" means "I speak" and should be connected with the previous explanation.

The Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra is like a moist land, the elephant roars like a cloud that arrives out of season, until it hears the roar of the lion from the cave. Without an example, the common people often do not understand the meaning, so an example is presented. Shishupala, who was the son of Madri, was roaring loudly, praising himself before seeing Krishna, but when he saw Narayana - Shri Krishna, the great warrior, who was steadfast in the Dharma-war, firm in nature, never broken in battle, and unwavering, he was filled with anger. As it is said - he was previously engaged in excessive self-praise, he forgot everything. Similarly, the meaning should be understood from the example to be told further. The meaning is connected with the further part of the story. That part of the story is as follows.

-

King Damaghosha's sister Vasudeva gave birth to a son named Shishupala. He was four-armed, incredibly powerful, and fond of quarrels. When his mother saw this four-armed, powerful son, she was happy on one hand, and trembled with fear on the other. She called a fortune teller to know the future. The fortune teller, after contemplation and discussion, said to Madri, with a happy heart and a cheerful mind - "Your son will be very powerful and invincible in battle, but if you see that your son, like everyone else, has only two arms, then understand that he will be afraid of that man. There is no doubt in what I say." Hearing this, Madri was very scared. She showed her son to Krishna, and as soon as Krishna looked at him, he was left with only two arms, like every other man. Then Krishna's aunt, falling at the feet of her son, pleaded with him that if he ever committed any offense, he should forgive him. Krishna promised that he would forgive his hundred offenses. After this, Shishupala grew up. Filled with the pride of youth, he began to insult Shri Krishna, to abuse him. Although Shri Krishna was capable of punishing him, according to his promise, he continued to forgive his offenses. Thus, when Shishupala had committed a hundred offenses, Krishna tried to reason with him, to persuade him not to do so again, but he did not stop - he continued to abuse. Then Shri Krishna cut off his head with his discus. || 1 ||

Translation - When the battle breaks out, there is also a cowardly man who boasts of his bravery, but in the unbearable battle, he becomes fearful and confused, he panics. In such a situation of panic, where even the mother does not recognize her own son falling into her lap, that cowardly man, wounded and defeated, becomes miserable.
The son who is advancing in the
battle is cut down by his conqueror.

## The Study of Adjectives

-
The commentary says, "Like a plant that is weak and unsteady, which is blown about by the wind, so too are those who boast loudly with their words, and who go to the head of the battle, but when the battle begins, and the brave soldiers of the enemy army come forward, they are struck down by their weapons. Then all are troubled and frightened, so much so that a mother does not even notice her child falling from her lap, who is still sucking milk. In this way, in the battle, the warriors of the enemy army, with their chakra, kunta, naraacha, shakti, and other weapons, wound and kill, and those who are weak and cowardly, are broken and become miserable."

## The Commentary Explains

Now, a present-day example is given, which is well-known to the world. Many men, who consider themselves heroes, praise themselves with their words, roar loudly, and walk with a fierce gait, and reach the head of the battle. But when the battle begins, and the brave soldiers of the enemy army come forward, they begin to strike with their weapons, then all are troubled and frightened, so much so that a mother does not even notice her child falling from her lap, who is still sucking milk. In this way, in the battle, the warriors of the enemy army, with their chakra, kunta, spears, naraacha - sharp arrows, and shakti, etc., wound and kill, and those who are weak and cowardly, are broken and become miserable.

## Thus, He Considers Himself a Hero

**Shadow**

-
**Unbeaten,**
**A beggar, a fool.** He considers himself a hero, **as long as he does not practice.** || 3 ||
-
Thus, a novice, who is unskilled in begging, and who has not been touched by the trials, considers himself a hero, as long as he does not practice restraint.

## Commentary

The word "thus" indicates a comparison. Just as that man, who considers himself a hero, roars like a lion, and goes to the head of the battle, but then, seeing the victorious Vasudeva, or another warrior, fighting, becomes miserable, so too, a "student," a newly ordained monk, who has not been touched by the trials, who is unskilled in begging, and who is not proficient in other aspects of conduct, considers himself a hero, like a child who is still sucking milk, as long as he does not practice "rough" restraint, because he does not have the cause of the combination of actions. When he attains it, many who are weak and cowardly, are broken. || 3 ||

## Commentary Explains

Now, the essence of the example is explained. The word "thus" in this verse indicates the present meaning. Just as that man, who considers himself a hero, roars loudly like a lion, and goes to the head of the battle, but then, seeing someone like Vasudeva, or another warrior, fighting, becomes miserable, so too, a novice monk, who has not been touched by the trials, who is unskilled in begging, and who is not proficient in other aspects of conduct, considers himself a hero, like a child who is still sucking milk, as long as he does not practice "rough" restraint, because he does not have the cause of the combination of actions. When he attains it, many who are weak and cowardly, are broken. || 3 ||

The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra

It should be known that just as a mendicant is unskilled due to being newly initiated, so too are others unskilled in other disciplines. Is it difficult to follow the life of a renunciate? Thus, one who boasts considers himself a hero like Sisupala until he faces restraint like a victorious man - until he does not partake of restraint. In this verse, restraint is called "luhan ruksham" because just as nothing sticks to a dry or dry place, in the same way, karma does not stick where there is restraint in life. Upon attaining that restraint - when the opportunity to follow that restraint arises - many gurukarma - beings with heavy karma, of low intellect, devoid of self-strength - are broken, shattered.

**Verse 4**

Just as in the winter season - the months of Margashirsha and Pausha - cold pervades all limbs, at that time, dull, foolish beings experience sorrow like a kingless - dethroned Kshatriya.

**Commentary**

To explain the harshness of restraint, it is said, "Jaya Hemante" etc. When, sometimes, in the month of Pausha or Margashirsha, the "sheeta" - cold with snow and wind - "sprushati" - touches, "tatra" - in that unbearable cold touch, some "manda" - dull, ignorant, burdened with heavy gurukarma - "visidanti" - experience sorrow, "rajyaheena" - like dethroned Kshatriyas.

**Verse 5**

When touched by the heat of summer, the newly initiated muni becomes dejected and thirsty. At that time, dull, ignorant men experience sorrow like fish in shallow water.

**Commentary**

When the scorching heat of summer sets in during the months of Jyeshta and Ashadha, the newly initiated muni, afflicted by the heat and thirst, becomes dejected. At that time, dull, ignorant men experience sorrow like fish in shallow water.

---------------------------
##  Upasargaadhyayanam

**Commentary:**  The intense heat of the months of Jyeshtha and Ashadha is called 'Griishmaabhithaap'.  A person touched by this heat, enveloped by it, becomes 'Vimanaska' - dejected, sad, and deeply afflicted by thirst.  He becomes extremely weak due to the intense thirst.  The sutrakar (author of the sutra) points out that when this heat arises, those who are weak and dull, experience great sorrow.  He gives an example:  Just as fish, in shallow water, become distressed by the heat of summer and die because they cannot escape, similarly, those with weak souls, even after accepting the path of conduct, become drenched in sweat and dirt, and are scorched by the external heat.  They remember cool lakes, streams, sandalwood, and other things that can alleviate the heat.  Their minds become agitated, and they become dejected in their practice of restraint.

**Sada Datteshana Dukkha, Jayana Duppanollya.  Puhdojhana. ||6||**

**Cheva,**

**Kammatta**
**Dubbhaga**
**Icchansu**
**Chhaya Sada Datteshana Dukham Yancha Duspranodya.  Karmartta: Durbhagaschaiveti Aahu: Prithakjanah. ||**

**Translation:**  The virtuous person always experiences sorrow from the desire for things given by others, because it is forbidden for them to accept things that are not given for their own use.  'Yancha' - begging is also a hardship, which is difficult to bear.  Even so, ordinary people, who do not understand the importance of restraint, see the virtuous person and say, "How unfortunate they are, they are suffering the painful results of their past actions."

**Commentary:**  Now, taking up the hardship of begging, the sutra says, "Sada Datta" etc.  For the yatis (ascetics), everything given by others, even for things like cleaning their teeth, is 'eshaniya' - it must be accepted without any fault of desire for gain, etc.  Therefore, for those who are suffering from hunger and other afflictions, the desire for things given by others is a constant source of sorrow.  And even this 'Yancha' - the hardship of begging, is 'pranodyate' - abandoned with difficulty by those with weak souls.  And it is said:

"Khijjaee Muhalaavanna Vaaya Gholei Kanthamjhami.  Kah Kahkahei Hiyayan Dehiti Para Bhanantass. ||1|| Chhaya - Kshiyate Mukhalaavanya Vaacha Gilaate (Dhoornati) Kanthammadhye, Kahkahkahi Hridayam Dehiiti Param Bhavatas. ||1||  Gatibhramsho Mukhe Dainyam Gaatrasvedo Vivarnata.  Marane Yani Chihnani Tani Chihnani Yachke. ||1||"

And so on.  Thus, those with great souls, who have abandoned the desire for begging, which is difficult to abandon, follow the path of the great men, serving them and increasing their knowledge, etc.  The second half of the verse shows the hardship of begging:  "Prithakjanah" - ordinary people, who are not noble, are like the uncultured.

Page #230:
---------------------------
The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra says, "They are liberated," as follows: These ascetics, with bodies covered in dust, with matted hair, afflicted by hunger and other pains, are suffering from the karmas they have accumulated in the past. They are experiencing the fruits of their past actions. Or, they are afflicted by karmas such as agriculture, unable to perform them, and have become ascetics out of desperation. Thus, these unfortunate ones, abandoned by all, including their wives and children, have taken to the path of renunciation. ||6||

Commentary: It is expected of a virtuous person to search for even a toothbrush or a twig for cleaning teeth given by another. He should seek out what is blameless. For him, only food free from the faults of production, acquisition, etc., is acceptable or fit for consumption. Therefore, a virtuous person afflicted by hunger and other pains has to endure the difficulty of searching for things given by others throughout his life. Begging for alms is also a kind of suffering. Those who lack inner strength cannot bear it. Therefore, wise people have said that the beauty of the face of a man who begs for something, saying, "Give me this," fades away. His voice gets stuck in his throat. His heart becomes agitated. His gait becomes distorted. A sense of dejection appears on his face. He starts sweating. His complexion becomes pale. All the signs that appear in a man at the time of death are visible in a man who begs. Only those who are fearless and possess inner strength can endure the suffering of begging, which is very difficult to bear. They walk on the path that great men have walked, for the growth of knowledge, etc.

The author of the Sutra, in the latter part of the present verse, speaks about the suffering of insults. Ordinary people, whose nature is like that of non-Aryans, seeing the ascetics, start saying, "These ascetics have dirt all over their bodies, their hair is matted, they are afflicted by hunger and other pains. Thus, they are suffering the fruits of the sins they committed in their previous births. They have become ascetics because they are unable to support themselves through agriculture and other means of livelihood. These people are unfortunate, deprived of family, including wives and children, and all other things, and homeless. Therefore, they have embraced renunciation."

Hearing such insulting words in villages, cities, or in between, the weak-minded, those lacking discernment, become sad and sorrowful, like cowardly men in battle. ||7||

Commentary: "Etan" refers to the aforementioned words of insult, as well as words like "thief" and "rogue." Those who are unable to bear these words, living in villages, cities, or in between, become sad and sorrowful when they hear these insults.

Page #231:
---------------------------
Those who are weak-minded and of low character, they become disheartened by hearing words of reproach, theft, adultery, etc., and they fall from the path of restraint. Just as cowards in battle, overwhelmed by the sight of swords, spears, axes, arrows, and the din of drums, trumpets, and cymbals, abandon their courage and flee, seeking only to escape, so too, those of weak spirit, upon hearing words of anger, become disheartened and abandon restraint. ||7||

Again, the text says:

A hungry mendicant, bitten by a vicious dog, may become disheartened. Just as a creature touched by fire becomes distressed, so too, the weak-minded become disheartened. ||8||

Commentary:

The word "api" in this verse indicates possibility. A vicious dog, by nature, may bite a hungry mendicant who is wandering in search of food. When the mendicant is bitten by the dog, the weak-minded, lacking in wisdom, become distressed and fearful. Just as creatures touched by fire become distressed and contract their limbs in pain, so too, the mendicant, attacked by a vicious creature, may fall from restraint. It is difficult to endure such obstacles in villages. ||8||

Page #232:
---------------------------
Some people say, "These are those who have come to the path of the wicked, who are opposed to the virtuous. They are those who are suffering the consequences of their past deeds, as they are living on alms."

Upasargadhyayanam

They are inferior, detestable, and have shaved heads. They have wounds from diseases like itching, their limbs are deformed due to scratching, their organs are destroyed like Sanatakumara due to lack of bathing, washing, etc., and they are very dirty and foul-smelling due to dried sweat on their body. They are impure and create unrest for living beings. 

Evam vippatipanne, tamo te tamanjanti,
Chaya -
Appana u ajjana. Manda moheṇa pāuḍā.

Translation:
Thus, the deluded ones, devoid of self-knowledge, enveloped by delusion, go from one darkness to another.

Commentary:
'Evam' - In this way, 'eke' - some sinful persons, 'vippatipanna:' - opposed to the righteous path, 'atmana' - themselves ignorant, not heeding the words of the discerning, 'tama:' - the superior darkness of ignorance, 'yanti' - go, or descend to even lower states, because 'manda:' - obstructed by the veil of ignorance, and 'moha' - delusion, they are 'pravṛta:' - enveloped.

Puṭṭho ya
Daṃsamasaehi,
Na ye diṭṭhe pare loe, jai paraṃ
Taṇhāphāsamacāiya.
Maraṇaṃ siya.

Translation:
Stung by mosquitoes and flies, unable to bear even the touch of grass, if there is the prospect of death in the other world, what fault is there in me?

Page #234:
---------------------------
English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Sūtrakṛtāṅga Sūtra states that a Sādhu (ascetic), who is afflicted and cannot endure the rough and harsh touch of the straw bed and grass bedding, starts thinking that though he has not directly witnessed the afterlife, he is experiencing a pain akin to death or dying from this distress.

Commentary: In certain regions like Sindhu, Tāmraliptā, and Koṃkaṇa, there are abundant mosquitoes and flies. A wandering Sādhu may sometimes be bitten by them and, being devoid of possessions, unable to bear the harsh touch of the grass bed. In such a situation, he may lose his composure and think that the austere practices he is undertaking might be appropriate only if the afterlife exists, as he has not directly perceived it, nor is it established through inference or other means. If his death were to occur due to this affliction, that would be the only result, without any other fruit.

The verse states: "Tormented by the plucking of their hair, defeated in brahmacarya (celibacy), the dull-witted ones grieve there, like fish pierced in the net."

Commentary: The dull-minded individuals, tormented by the plucking of their hair, which causes great pain due to the bleeding, and defeated in the practice of brahmacarya, grieve in that situation of hair-plucking, just as fish trapped in a net are helpless and lose their lives.

Page #235:
---------------------------
When the urge of desire surges, they become cool and relaxed in following restraint, or they become completely corrupt and degenerate from restraint, like a fish caught in a net, unable to find a way out, dies in it. In the same way, those unfortunate ones, defeated by the all-conquering desire, become degenerate from a life of restraint.
Those who follow the path of self-punishment, with false beliefs, filled with joy and hatred, they are the ones who torment the righteous.
Those who follow the path of self-punishment, with false beliefs, filled with joy and hatred, they are the ones who torment the righteous.
Some ignorant men, seeing a virtuous monk wandering around the country, tie him up with ropes, calling him a spy or a thief, and torment him with harsh words full of anger.

Page #236:
---------------------------
English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

In this verse, the word 'api' is used to indicate a possibility, i.e., it is possible that some unrighteous individuals with deluded intellect, overcome by attachment and aversion, seeing a Sadhu (ascetic) wandering in the unrighteous region, consider him to be a spy or a thief, and thus torment him.

They bind the Sadhu with ropes, etc. and afflict him. The ignorant ones, lacking the discrimination between right and wrong, also revile the Sadhu with wrathful and harsh words, intimidating and threatening him.

There, in that unrighteous region, the Sadhu, beaten with a staff, fist, or even a fruit, if he is still immature, remembers his kinsmen, just as a woman, driven by anger, fleeing from her home, remembers her relatives.

Further, the verse states that these harsh, cruel, and unbearable sufferings faced by the Sadhu make him long for the comfort and security of his home, just as the woman, after being chased by thieves and other miscreants, becomes remorseful and remembers her family members.

Prefix Study
Oh! All these touches are rough and unbearable.
Like an elephant pierced by arrows, they are weak and have gone back to the house.  I say this.
Translation
Students! The prefixes mentioned earlier are unbearable and painful, overwhelmed by them, cowardly men return to household life. Just as an elephant wounded by arrows flees the battlefield, so too do men without inner strength abandon restraint in fear, I say this.
-
Commentary - To conclude, he says, "Oh" is an address to the students, those who have been described as afflictions from the beginning, such as bites of mosquitoes, etc., are afflictions because they cause pain. "All" means all, in abundance, they are touched - experienced by the sense of touch, therefore they are called touches. What kind are they? "Rough" because they are done by the unrefined, they cause pain, and those with little strength cannot bear them, and some of those with low character, accepting praise, like an elephant on the battlefield, "pierced by a net of arrows" - overwhelmed by hundreds of arrows, they suffer defeat, similarly, "weak" - powerless, "subdued" - under the control of others, bound by karma, they have gone back to the house, or in another reading, "with intense speed" - with intense speed, "deceitful" - deceitful in their practices, they have abandoned restraint and gone to the house, I say this, as before. ||17|| This is the first objective of the study of afflictions.

I
Commentary - In the present verse, the word "Oh" is used to address the students, who have been described as afflictions from the beginning, such as bites of mosquitoes, etc., are afflictions because they cause pain. "All" means all, in abundance, they are touched - experienced by the sense of touch, therefore they are called touches. They are all inflicted by unrefined men, they cause pain, and those with little strength cannot bear them, and some of those with low character, accepting praise, first accept restraint, but like an elephant wounded by arrows, flees the battlefield, so too do these men, unable to bear the aforementioned afflictions, return to household life. They are truly burdened by the heavy karma of the guru's actions, in some places, "intensely deceitful" - intensely deceitful, this reading is found. This means that those who are oppressed by intense, harsh afflictions and are deceitful and wicked, have abandoned restraint and departed for home, becoming householders again, I say this.
The first objective of the third study, called the knowledge of afflictions, is complete.

## The Second Section of the Sutra-Kritanga Sutra

The first section has been explained. Now, the second section is being started. This second section is connected to the first section. This is the study of prefixes. The aim is to explain the nature of prefixes. Prefixes are of two types: unfavorable and favorable. The unfavorable prefixes were explained in the first section. In this section, the favorable prefixes are being explained. This is the connection between this second section and the first. Its first sutra is as follows:

**Ahimsa, sahuma, sanga, bhikkhunam je duruttara. Jaththa ege visiyanti, na chayanthi javitte.** ||1||

**Commentary:**

These subtle attachments are difficult for monks to overcome. Some are overwhelmed by them and are unable to maintain their vows.

**Translation:**

After explaining unfavorable prefixes, now favorable prefixes are being explained. These are very subtle. Monks can overcome these prefixes with great difficulty, but many men are overwhelmed by them and become unable to follow their vows.

**Explanation of the Commentary:**

The word "atha" indicates continuation. After explaining unfavorable prefixes, favorable prefixes are being explained. This is the aim. The use of the word "ime" here refers to something that is directly present and nearby, which means that these favorable prefixes are being taken up, which will be explained later.

The affectionate attachment of family members does not distort the external body, but rather distorts the mind. Therefore, it is called subtle and internal. Unfavorable prefixes, on the other hand, distort the body in a visible way, and are therefore called external. These attachments, such as those to parents, are difficult for even virtuous monks to overcome. Even though unfavorable prefixes, such as those caused by obstacles in livelihood, are difficult to overcome, great men can overcome them by practicing detachment. These favorable prefixes, however, can also lead to virtue. Therefore, they are difficult to overcome. In these prefixes, some people, who are of lesser virtue, become disheartened and abandon their practice altogether. They are unable to maintain their vows.

Page #239:
---------------------------
The study of the upsargas distorts the external body, in that way these upsargas do not distort the external body, therefore they are not gross, here the word 'sangha' has come which is indicative of the relationship of parents etc. relatives. It is difficult even for virtuous men to cross the relationship of relatives, adverse upsargas which put life in danger, calamity or difficulty when they come, here men rich in satva - self-strength accept the mediating attitude - neutral feeling. They are not affected by them, but it is difficult to accept neutral feeling when favorable upsargas are present, favorable upsargas make even great men fall from dharma. Therefore, the Agamkar has called favorable upsargas as difficult or difficult to cross - which are difficult to cross. When a favorable upsarga is present, men devoid of self-power become slack, unstable or loose in the observance of coolness - restraint. Or they completely abandon restraint, they become unable to live a restrained life.

They see you, they cry for the family. They nourish you. You are asked, whose father are you? Do you laugh? ||1||
Sadhu
Translation The relatives of the Sadhu see him and surround him and start crying - they say to him - Father! Why are you abandoning us? We have raised you, now you nourish us, raise us.
-
-
Commentary - To show those subtle relationships, he says - 'Api: ' in the sense of possibility 'Eke' such 'Jnatavy:' relatives, parents etc. when they see the one who has renounced the world or the one who has taken initiation, they surround him and cry, they cry and say with humility as - from childhood you have been nourished by us, you will be the caretaker of the old, so now "Na:" we are not your father, "Tat!" son, nourish us, raise us, for whom - for what reason or by whose strength are you abandoning us? We have no other protector except you. ||2|| And
-
Commentary The Agamkar says to reveal those subtle relationships - in the present verse 'Api' word is used in the sense of possibility. Its meaning is that what is said in this verse is possible - it happens, mother father and their similar family members see the renounced - initiated or the one who has taken initiation, they surround him, start crying, and with humility and compassion start saying son! We raised you from childhood so that you would serve us when we are old. Now you raise us. Why or by whose support are you leaving us. O father! We have no other protector except you.
-
Beloved, you are a monk
Brother, you are a relative
Father! Father!
Brother, what is your brother?

These are small.

**Verse 1:**

"O Elder, your father is old! Your sister is young. Your brothers are your own, born of the same womb. Why do you abandon us?"

**Commentary:**

"O son! Your father is old, he has lived more than a hundred years. Your sister, standing before you, is young, she has not yet reached womanhood. These are your brothers, born of the same womb, they are before you. Why do you abandon us?"

**Verse 2:**

"O son! Nourish your mother and father. By doing so, your afterlife will be good. This is the way of the world. People nourish their parents."

"Where the elders are revered, where the food is well-prepared, where there is no strife in speech, there, O Indra, I reside."

**Verse 3:**

"O son! Be happy, be joyful. Your wife is young, O father! Do not let her go to another's house."

## Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra - Translation

**O Father!** Go home once and then return. By doing so, you will not become an Ashraman (non-ascetic) - your Shramanya (asceticism) will not be lost. Again, who can stop you there, while performing your endeavors with a detached mind, without any desire or attachment in the house?

**Commentary:** 'Tat' (Father)! Having gone to the house and seen your family, you return, and by this mere act of going home, you will not become an Ashraman. 'Akamagan' (without desire) - without desire for household affairs, 'Parakraman' (performing endeavors) - performing your intended actions, who is worthy to stop you, to forbid you? Or, in old age, when your desires are gone, who can stop you when you are engaged in the practice of self-restraint?

**Meaning of Commentary:** O Father! Go home, see your family, and then return. By merely going home, you will not become devoid of Shramanya - your virtue will not be lost by simply doing that. Who can stop you while being engaged in household affairs - the duties of a householder - without desire, without attachment, and according to your own intentions? Or, when old age arrives, and your desires are gone, who can stop you when you are striving with vigor in the practice of self-restraint?

**Whatever debt you have, Father, we have settled it all. We will give you the gold you need for your transactions.**

**Commentary:** Further, 'Tat' (Father)! Whatever debt you had, we have divided it equally and 'Samikritam' (settled) it. If it was a heavy debt, we have 'Samikritam' (settled) it - arranged for it to be easily paid. Whatever 'Hiranyam' (gold) - wealth - is used in transactions, etc., or in any other way, we will give it to you. Do not be afraid of being poor.

**Meaning of Commentary:** O Father! We have settled the debt you had - we have divided it equally among ourselves and arranged for it. Or, we have made the heavy debt you had easy to pay. From now on, we will give you whatever money you need for your personal needs, business, and other activities. Therefore, never fear in your mind that you are poor. Concluding the topic, we say further:

**Those who are bound by desires, do not find peace, they are not free from attachment, they are born of worldly desires. Therefore, abandon the house.**

Chaya
- 
The family members, with compassionate feelings arising within themselves, impart excellent education and make entreaties. Then, the deluded monk, bound by attachment to his kinsmen, abandons the life of asceticism and austerity and rushes back home.

Upasargadhyanam
Thus, the compassionate ones instruct him. Bound by the associations of caste, he rushes back to the house.

Commentary - The word 'na' is used as a figure of speech. In this way, the mother, father, and others, with compassionate and tender words, create compassion in the mind of the monk, or they themselves are in a state of humility, and they instruct him, make entreaties to him, and establish their words in his heart. The immature in dharma - the unripe in dharma, he is the monk, of little courage - extremely lacking in self-power, and heavy in karmas, being attached to the affection of his family members such as mother, father, son, etc., bound by their attachment, rushes back to the house, abandoning the life of renunciation and getting entangled in the snare of household life.

Just as a tree born in the forest is bound by a creeper, in the same way, the kinsmen, in a state of non-equanimity, bind him.

Malaya
Chaya
-
Just as a tree born in the forest is bound by a creeper,
Similarly, the kinsmen, in a state of non-equanimity, bind him.

Commentary - Furthermore, just as a tree born in the forest is 'bound' (entwined) by a creeper, in the same way, the kinsmen, with their lack of equanimity, 'bind' (attach) him. They attract him towards themselves.

Also, 
"The enemy, in the guise of a friend, embraces (him) and weeps. Do not go to the good destination, both of us shall go to the bad destination."

Page #244:
---------------------------
- The Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra says that relatives are not truly friends or well-wishers. They are enemies - those who do harm. Just as a friend puts his arm around another's neck and cries, as if to say, "Friend! Do not take a step towards liberation, towards the highest state, come, let us both go towards the path of misery."
Those bound by kinship, like a newly captured elephant, are surrounded by their relatives. They follow behind, like a mother cow near her calf.
Commentary: Bound by kinship - enslaved by the ties of parents, etc., they are bound in various ways. These relatives, by doing everything to please him, create a sense of security. Like a newly captured elephant, he is treated with all kinds of things to make him feel secure, such as sugarcane pieces, etc. In the same way, he is treated with all kinds of things to please him. Another example is given: Just as a newly delivered cow stays close to her calf and follows behind, so too do these relatives, thinking of their renounced one as newly born, follow behind him, becoming followers of his path.
These ties are like a pit for humans, a place of danger. Those who are bound by them are unconscious. 
Commentary: These ties are like a pit for humans, a place of danger. Those who are bound by them are unconscious.

Page #245:
---------------------------
##  Upasargadhyayanam

It is as difficult for humans to overcome the attachment or affection of family members as it is to cross the ocean. Men who are weak, lacking in self-strength, and overwhelmed by the attachment of their male relatives, lose their composure and suffer.

## Commentary

The term "sanga" refers to the attachments that bind a being, such as the relationships with parents, etc. These are the causes of karma. Just as humans cannot cross the vast, bottomless ocean, similarly, beings with weak self-strength cannot overcome these attachments. Those who are bound by the attachment to their parents, etc., are weak and suffer. They remain trapped in the cycle of birth and death. How are they trapped? They are overwhelmed by the relationships with their children, etc., and are like vultures, greedy and clinging. They do not reflect on their own suffering in the cycle of birth and death.

##  Verse 13

The monk, knowing all attachments to be great sources of karma, should not desire a life of non-restraint after hearing the supreme Dharma.

## Commentary

The monk should abandon the attachment to family, the main cause of rebirth, by knowing it and rejecting it. Why? Because all attachments are great gateways for karma. Therefore, the monk should not desire a life of non-restraint, even when faced with favorable circumstances. Similarly, the monk should not desire a life of non-restraint when faced with unfavorable circumstances. The life of a householder is not conducive to liberation. Why? Because the monk has heard and understood the Dharma, which is the path of right conduct and right speech. There is no higher Dharma than this, which is the supreme Dharma taught by the Arhats.

Page #246:
---------------------------
**The Sutra of the Sri Sutra Kritanga**

Do not aspire to be bound by the fetters of the pāśa (bondage). If adverse and unpleasant afflictions arise, do not desire life. Face them by risking your life. Do not desire to live a worldly life while following unrighteous karma. How? By hearing what? It is said that one should do so by hearing the supreme dharma, the dharma rooted in right knowledge (śruta-samyak-jñāna) and right conduct (cāritra-samyak-ācāra), which is spoken by the Tīrthankaras.

**Verse 14**

*Ahiṃe santi āvaṭṭā, kāsaveṇaṃ paveiyā. Buddā jattāvasappanti, sīyanti abuha jahiṃ.*

**Translation**

These are the āvartas (cycles) that have been explained by the Kāśyapa (Śramaṇa Bhagavan Mahāvīra). The enlightened ones (buddhas) stay away from them, while the unenlightened ones (abuḍḍha) fall into them.

**Commentary**

The word "athe" indicates the beginning of a new section. Alternatively, the word "aho" can be used, which signifies wonder or surprise. The word "ime" indicates that these āvartas are well-known and readily apparent. There are two types of āvartas: dravyāvarta and bhāvāvarta. The whirlpools of rivers, etc., are dravyāvarta. The desire for wealth and possessions, which arises from the intense and overwhelming karmic influence, is bhāvāvarta. The Lord Mahāvīra, who possessed divine knowledge and omniscience, has explained the nature of āvartas. Those who are wise and understand the consequences of āvartas remain vigilant and stay away from them. However, the unenlightened ones, due to their lack of discernment, become attached to them and suffer greatly.

**Verse 15**

*Rāyaṇo rāya'macca ya, māhaṇā aduva khattiyā. Nimantiyaṃti bhogehiṃ, bhikkuyaṃ sāhujīviṇaṃ.*

**Translation**

Kings, ministers, Brahmins, and Kshatriyas invite the monks (bhikku) who live a virtuous life (sāhujīviṇa) with material pleasures (bhogehiṃ).

Page #247:
---------------------------
##  Upasargaadhyayanam Chhaya - Kings, ministers, Brahmanas, or Kshatriyas invite the mendicant, the virtuous one, with enjoyments.

**Anuvaad** - The kings, their ministers, Brahmanas, or Kshatriyas, all invite the Muni, who follows pure, restrained, and complete conduct in the virtuous life, to return to a life of enjoyments.

**Teeka** - 'Rajanah' (kings) like Chakravarti, 'Rajamaatyasch' (ministers) like Mantri, Purohit, etc., and Brahmanas or 'Kshatriyas' like those born in the Ikshvaku dynasty, all invite with 'bhogaih' (enjoyments) like words, etc. They make the mendicant, the 'sadhujeevin', accept enjoyments and pleasures. 'Sadhujeevin' means one who lives with virtuous conduct, like the Muni. For example, Chakravarti Brahmadatt invited the Muni Chitra with various enjoyments. Similarly, others, who are connected in some way, invite the virtuous one, who possesses qualities like youth, etc., with the aim of worldly enjoyments.

**Teekaarth** - Chakravarti and other great kings, ministers, priests, etc., and Brahmanas and Kshatriyas born in the Ikshvaku dynasty, etc., all invite through words and other means. They request the acceptance of a life of enjoyments and pleasures. To clarify the subject, they ask a question: Whom do they invite? They invite the 'sadhujeevin', the mendicant or Muni, who lives a life of pure conduct and complete virtue. For example, Chakravarti Brahmadatt invited Muni Chitra with various enjoyments to enjoy them. Similarly, other men, who are connected in some way, invite a virtuous man with qualities like youth and beauty, etc., with the aim of worldly enjoyments.

**Om Om Om Hatthassarahajaneehim, Vihaaragamanehi Ya.
Bhujam Bhoge Ime Sagghe, Maharisie! Poojayamu Tam.**

**Chhaya** - With elephants, horses, chariots, and journeys for pleasure, enjoy these enjoyments, O great sage! We worship you.

**Anuvaad** - The kings, etc., address the Muni and say: O great sage! Ride on elephants, horses, chariots, etc., and go on journeys for pleasure, wander in gardens, etc. Enjoy these praiseworthy and excellent enjoyments. Let us worship you, honor you, and pay our respects to you.

**Teeka** - To show this, the sutrakar says: With elephants, horses, chariots, and 'vihaaragamana' (journeys for pleasure), they invite with things that are pleasing to the senses. For example, they invite with 'bhujksva bhogan' (enjoy these enjoyments), 'iman' (these), 'shladhyan' (praiseworthy), 'maharsie' (O great sage), 'tvam' (you). We worship you with these enjoyments and means.

**Teekaarth** - To express the above sentiment, the sutrakar states: It is possible that the king, etc., approach the Muni and invite him, requesting him to ride on elephants, horses, chariots, etc., and

Page #248:
---------------------------
**The Sutra of the Sri Sutra Kritanga**

Get on a chariot and go for a stroll in the gardens and parks for the purpose of recreation, entertainment, and to divert your mind. The word "cha" used here means to enjoy the praiseworthy, excellent, and unblamable words and other subjects presented by us. O great sage! We honor and respect you by presenting you with the materials for the enjoyment of objects and the enjoyment of enjoyment.

**Verse 17**

_Vastra-gandha-alankara, itthiyo samanaani ya. Bhumjahimaai, bhogaai auso! Pujayamu tam._

**Translation:**

O long-lived one! Enjoy the clothes, fragrant substances, ornaments, women, beds, and other enjoyable things. We honor and respect you.

**Commentary:**

"Vastra" refers to silk, cotton, etc. "Gandha" refers to fragrant substances like sandalwood paste, etc. "Vastra-gandha" is a compound word meaning clothes and fragrant substances. "Alankara" refers to ornaments like necklaces, bracelets, etc. "Itthiyo" refers to young women. "Sayanaani" refers to beds with mattresses, pillows, and blankets. Enjoy these enjoyable things that are pleasing to the senses and mind, which have been presented to you by us. O long-lived one! We honor and respect you.

**Verse 18**

_Jo tume niyamo chinno, bhikku bhavammi suvvaaya. . . Aagaaramavasantas, savvo sanvijae taha._

**Translation:**

O one who has attained the highest vows! You have accepted the Arhathood initiation and are engaged in the observance of the great vows, etc. Even while living in a house, those vows will remain the same and will continue to be observed.

**Commentary:**

Furthermore, O one who has attained the highest vows! The great vows, etc., which you have observed in the past during your renunciation, have been fulfilled by the restraint of the senses. Even now, while living in a house, you will continue to observe the householder's life properly. The idea is that good and bad deeds, once done, do not disappear.

**Verse 19**

(220)

Page #249:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Commentary on the Verse:**

This is an excellent vow for those who have taken the vow of renunciation. The monks, having received the initiation of renunciation, have attained peace in their minds and senses. They will continue to abide by the great vows and other rules, even while living as householders, because the merits and demerits accumulated by humans are never destroyed.

**Verse 19:**

**Shadow:** For a long time, you have been practicing restraint. Now, where is the fault in you?
**Translation:** They invite the monk to enjoy worldly pleasures, just as they entice a pig with rice grains.

**Commentary:** The verse explains that the monk, having practiced restraint for a long time, is now being tempted by worldly pleasures. The verse uses the analogy of a pig being lured into a trap with rice grains to illustrate how easily a monk can be tempted by worldly pleasures.

**Verse 20:**

**Shadow:** Those who are urged to follow the path of a mendicant, but are unable to bear it, become disheartened, like weak oxen on a steep path.
**Translation:** Those who are weak and ignorant, having taken the vow of a mendicant, are unable to follow it. They abandon their vows, just like weak oxen fall on a steep path.

**Commentary:** The verse explains that those who are weak and ignorant, having taken the vow of a mendicant, are unable to follow it. They abandon their vows, just like weak oxen fall on a steep path. This verse highlights the importance of strength and determination in following the path of renunciation.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra with Commentary - Conclusion of the Previously Mentioned Matters

The commentator states that the text now concludes the previously mentioned matters.

According to the scriptural method, there are ten types of Samachari for the wandering Sadhu, which are as sharp and difficult to bear as the edge of a sword. These are described by terms like "Iccha Miccha" and are called Bhikṣu-caryā. To follow this Bhikṣu-caryā, the Guru and others constantly encourage the Sadhu. Or, seeing the Sadhu struggling to follow this Bhikṣu-caryā, the Acharya and others repeatedly encourage them. However, some Sadhus, even after receiving such encouragement, find themselves unable to bear this hardship. Unable to properly sustain their lives by following the restraints, ignorant men become slack in their observance of these restraints, which were attained after countless births and are the primary means of attaining liberation. These dull and ignorant men abandon this restraint, which is like the Cintamani jewel, an inconceivable and powerful force, and which great men have practiced.

An example is given: The high part of a path is called "Udyanam". Just as oxen, burdened with heavy loads and weak, become exhausted while ascending this high path and lower their necks, unable to bear the burden they carry, so too, these ignorant men, unable to bear the burden of the five great vows they have accepted, become disheartened and abandon the restraint, being overcome by the emotions previously described, such as lust and greed.

**Verse 21:**

"Achayanta va loohenam, avahaanenam tajia. Tattha mandaa viseeyanti, ujaansi jaraggava."

**Commentary:**

"Rukṣeṇa" - unable to sustain themselves by the restraint, "Upadhānena" - being threatened by fasting and other internal and external austerities, "Tarjitā" - afflicted, these dull men become disheartened in their restraint. "Udyanaśirasi" - on the high peak, "Jīrṇa" - like an old ox, even a young ox might become exhausted there, let alone an old one. This is why the word "Jīrṇa" is used. Even a wise man with strong determination might become exhausted after a long time, let alone these dull men who are constantly being tempted.

Page #251:
---------------------------
Upasargadhyayana Tika-artha - The meaning of 'ruksha' is 'samyama' (restraint). The general meaning of 'ruksha' is dry or insipid. For those who desire physical pleasures, even 'samyama' is insipid. Those who are incapable of observing that 'samyama', are afraid of external austerities like fasting, etc. and internal austerities like svadhyaya (self-study) and dhyana (meditation), they experience sorrow in progressing on the path of 'samyama', just as a weak old ox experiences distress while climbing a steep path. Even a young ox is likely to experience depression and suffering while climbing a steep path. The use of the words 'jaraggava-jaradva-jirnnapada' here is to illustrate this sentiment. Even those who are courageous, strong and wise, are afflicted by obstacles and adversities. Then what to say about those who have been discussed earlier. 

Evam nimantanam laddham, mucchiya giddha itthisu.
Ajjhuppanna kamehi coijjanta gaya giham.

Translation - Having obtained an invitation, they became infatuated and greedy towards women. Attracted by sensual pleasures, they went back to the household life, even though they were urged by the teacher (guru) to observe restraint (samyama).

Tika - The verse says that having obtained an invitation accompanied by the provision of the means for sense enjoyment, they became extremely attached to those means of sense enjoyment, such as elephants, horses, chariots, etc. and greedy towards women, their minds being absorbed in sensual pleasures. Though urged by the teacher (guru) to observe restraint (samyama), they were unable to make the effort, being weak-willed, and returned to the household life, abandoning the life of renunciation.

The second objective of the study of 'Upasargadhyayana' is complete.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra
### Third Uddeshaka

The second Uddeshaka in the Upasarg Parijnaya has been discussed. Now, the third Uddeshaka is being commenced. Its connection with the previous Uddeshaka is as follows: In the previous two Uddeshaka, the Upasargas (obstacles) have been described as being of two types: favorable and unfavorable. It is being explained that these Upasargas lead to the destruction of Adhyatma (spiritual knowledge and detachment). This is the connection of this Uddeshaka with the previous ones. The first Sutra of this Uddeshaka is:

**"Jaha Sangamakalami, Pittato Bhirū Vehai. Valayam Gahaṇam ṇūmam, Ko Jaṇai Paraajayam? ||1||"**

**Commentary:** Just as a coward in the time of battle looks for a place of refuge behind him, so too, who knows the defeat in a deep, covered place?

**Translation:** A cowardly man, devoid of courage, when the time of battle arrives, looks for a pit or a hidden place for his own safety. He thinks to himself, "Who knows? In battle, who will be defeated?" Therefore, in times of danger, one should look for a place to hide beforehand.

**Tika (Commentary):** By way of example, it is said that the understanding of the subject matter is easy for those with weak minds. Therefore, the Sutrakar (author of the Sutra) presents his subject matter through an example: Just as a coward, who is not prepared for action, in the time of battle, when the enemy army is present, looks behind him for a place of refuge, a fort, etc., so too, the Sutrakar shows this: "Valayam" - where water is situated in a circular shape, or a pit without water, a place difficult to enter and exit, "Gahaṇam" - a place covered with trees like Dhawa, etc., "ṇūmam" - a hidden cave in a mountain, etc. Why does he look at such places? Because he thinks that in such a fierce battle, with a large army of soldiers, who knows who will be defeated? Because the success of actions is dependent on fate, even a few can defeat many. ||1||

**Tikaarth (Meaning of the Commentary):** By way of example, or illustration, it is said that those with weak minds, or those with weak intellect, easily understand a subject matter. Therefore, the Sutrakar presents his subject matter through an example: Just as a coward, who is not prepared for battle, when the enemy army is present, looks behind him for a place of refuge, a fort, etc., so too, the Sutrakar shows this: "Valayam" - a place where water is situated in a circular shape, or a pit without water, a place difficult to enter and exit, "Gahaṇam" - a place covered with trees like Dhawa, etc., "ṇūmam" - a hidden cave in a mountain, etc. He looks at such places, asking the question, "Why does he look at these places?" The Sutrakar answers this question by saying that the coward thinks that in such a fierce battle, with a large army of soldiers, who knows who will be defeated? Because the success of actions is dependent on fate, even a few can defeat many. ||1||

Page #253:
---------------------------
## The Study of Precepts

**A large number of valiant warriors have gathered in the battle, therefore, who knows who will be defeated, because sometimes even a few men can conquer a large number of people. The success of the task is in the hands of God.**

**Verse 2:**

**Shadow:**  "In many moments, or in a single moment, such a moment may arise, which makes victory or defeat possible. Therefore, the cowardly people look for a place where they can hide if they are defeated."

**Translation:**  "In many moments, or in a single moment, such a moment may arise, which makes victory or defeat possible. Therefore, the cowardly people look for a place where they can hide if they are defeated."

**Commentary:**  "In many moments, or in a single moment, such a moment may arise, which makes victory or defeat possible. In such a situation, it is possible that we, the defeated, will 'hide' and perish. Therefore, the cowardly people look for refuge in the back, to protect themselves from danger."

**The verse illustrates this point with an example, and then the author summarizes it.**

**Verse 3:**

**Shadow:**  "Thus, some Shramanas, knowing themselves to be weak, seeing the future fear, think of this Shruta (scripture) as a means of protection."

**Translation:**  "Thus, some Shramanas, knowing themselves to be weak, seeing the future fear, think of this Shruta (scripture) as a means of protection."

**Commentary:**  "Just as one who wants to enter a battle looks back and thinks, 'What will be my refuge, my protection, if I am defeated?' Similarly, some 'Shramanas' (ascetics), who are not firm in their resolve and are of weak character, knowing themselves to be 'weak' and unable to bear the burden of restraint for life, seeing the future fear, think, 'What will be my protection in old age, when I am weak, or in times of famine?' Thus, they think of livelihood and fear, and 'consider' (contemplate) other Shruta (scripture) that is beneficial to the world, as a means of protection."

Page #254:
---------------------------
This is the Sutra of the Sutra-Kritanga. This grammar, mathematics, astrology, medicine, horoscopy, mantras, etc., which I have heard and studied, may be for my protection in the beginning. ||3|| And this is what they think, as the commentator says:

Just as a cowardly man who wants to enter a battle - wants to participate in the battle as a soldier - first looks to see what kind of ring, pit, etc., will be useful for his protection after he is defeated. Similarly, the ascetic whose mind is not steady, who does not have sufficient self-strength, who considers himself unable to follow restraint throughout his life, thinks about the possible fears or difficulties in the future, thinking: "I am destitute, I have nothing, when old age comes, illness, etc., will arise, there will be a famine, who will protect me?" Thus, out of fear of livelihood, he thinks that grammar, mathematics, astrology, Ayurveda, horoscopy, mantra-shastra, etc., which I have studied, will protect me in times of trouble, will protect me. Those men without self-strength also imagine, as the Sutra-kar says:

Who knows the downfall, from women or water? When asked, we will say, we have nothing planned. ||4||

Commentary: Those who are weak in spirit, the course of their actions is diverse, there are many opportunities for carelessness, therefore, "Who knows?" Who can define "downfall" from a life of restraint? By whom will I be defeated, so that I will fall from restraint? Is it "from women" - from association with women, or "from water" - from the desire to use water for bathing, etc.? Thus, those who are weak imagine, "No," we have nothing "planned" - any previously earned wealth that will be useful in that situation. Therefore, "when asked" by others, we will "say" - we will say, we will use - grammar, etc., which we have heard. Thus, those who are weak in spirit, thinking this way, strive for the scriptures. But even so, the desired purpose is not achieved by those who are unfortunate. And so it is said:

"From the seed of knowledge, the fruit of peace, those who desire wealth, their effort is in vain, what is surprising in that? The actions of the doer do not have a fixed result, they are subject to another result, the seed of rice produces sprouts, but never an anklet." ||1||

To conclude, the commentator says:

Men who are weak in spirit and unfortunate think that the strength of beings is small, the course of actions is very diverse, one never knows what will happen, there are many reasons for carelessness. In such a situation, who can know by what obstacle I will be defeated and fall from restraint? 
(226)

Page #255:
---------------------------
I will go to study grammar. I don't know if my restraint will be lost due to the company of women or if I will become a fallen soul due to the desire to use water for bathing etc. Those unwise people think that we don't have any wealth earned earlier, which can support us in our livelihood if we fall from restraint. Therefore, when someone asks us, we will tell them the legal procedure for incorporating the knowledge of elephant training, archery, etc., and difficult questions like twisted, crooked, and complex questions. We will say, we will use it. It is certain that those men with weak character and weak self-power strive to study grammar etc., they work hard, but the desired purpose of those unfortunate people is not fulfilled by this. It is said - the seed of knowledge, which produces the fruit of peace, the effort of the man who wants the fruit of wealth from it, is futile, proves to be useless, then what is the wonder in this. The result of substances, actions is fixed, therefore, the substance cannot give a different result to its doer than its own result. A barley plant can never be produced from a rice seed. Now the sutrakar concludes by saying.
"Thus they write, the ring writers.
Those who are doubtful, and those who are ignorant of the path." ||5||
Commentary - Just as a coward, when the opportunity for war arises, thinks of finding a place to hide, in the same way, a doubtful, ignorant man thinks that worldly knowledge will protect us if we are corrupted by restraint - we will be able to protect ourselves, we will be able to make a living.
Commentary - 'Ityevami' is for the purpose of referring to the previous discourse, just as a coward, who wants to enter the war, becomes negligent towards the ring etc. when danger arises in the battlefield, in the same way, the renounced, due to their bad luck and weak character, become negligent towards grammar etc. for the sake of livelihood due to fear of livelihood. They imagine, what kind of? Doubt - mental confusion - whether we are able to carry this burden of restraint to the end or not, thus it is said -
"Rough practice, irregular, past time food, tasteless.
Earth bed, eye bath, celibacy." ||1||
They are those who have come to that - they have come, just as they are 'unskilled' towards the path, whether this path will lead to the desired land or not, thus they become mentally confused, in the same way, they are also doubtful about carrying the burden of restraint, they neglect arithmetic etc. for livelihood. ||5||
Now an example is given of the efforts of great men -
Commentary - Ityevam - this word is for the purpose of indicating the previous discourse. Just as a cowardly man, who wants to participate in the war, searches for a pit etc., a secret place to hide, when danger arises in the battlefield. Similarly, many self-powered renounced-initiated saints, due to their bad luck, become negligent towards grammar etc. for the sake of livelihood due to fear of livelihood.
(227)

Page #256:
---------------------------
The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra contemplates the concepts of knowledge. They think that we will be able to make a living through them. What kind of ascetics are they? While posing this question, they explain - the fickleness of the mind - is called doubt. These ascetics have doubt in their minds, whether they will be able to bear the burden of restraint until the end, whether they will be able to manage it or not? It is said that a monk, first of all, if he gets food, it is dry, cold, stale, even that is not available sometimes. Sometimes it is received after the time of eating has passed and that too is tasteless, devoid of taste, devoid of flavor. The Shraman has to sleep on the ground and has to pluck his hair, he has to produce them. He never has to bathe throughout his life and has to observe celibacy. Seeing these difficult and painful activities, many ascetics become doubtful about being able to carry out their restrained life till the end, they start doubting. Just as an ignorant traveler walking on the road doubts whether this road will lead me to where I want to go. Their minds become unstable, in the same way, many cowardly, weak-willed ascetics doubt about being able to sustain the burden of their restraint, their desired goal till the end, and they hope to make a living through the science of destiny, astrology and mathematics. Now the Sutrakar Mahāpuruṣas narrate an anecdote through the door of an example regarding their efforts.

Anuvad - Those who are known and famous, and Surapurangama - valiant, courageous people, who are in the forefront, at the time of war, at the time of war, do not think that if they are defeated or distressed, how will we save ourselves, they think that there is nothing greater than dying in battle.

'Surapurangama' those who are in the forefront of the brave, those who are on the shoulder of the army at the time of war, those who are like this, entering the war, 'do not look back' do not look back at the fort etc. for protection from danger, and they are of unwavering mind, but they think - what will happen to us? If death is the end, then it is a small matter for us who desire the eternal flow of fame, as it is said - "Even though they are fickle, they desire the vastness of the imperishable, with the lives of the brave, if there is fame, what is not enough? ||1|| ||6||
Thus, having shown the example of the soldier, the Dantika says
Tika-arth - In this verse, the use of the word 'tu' is to indicate the specialness of the valiant man described in this verse, as opposed to the cowardly man described earlier. Those who are very valiant, who are famous in the world for fighting with the enemy army, who are in the forefront of the army when the war breaks out,

## Sutra Kritanga Sutra

The Sutra explains the subject matter of the question raised: What are the Sadhus engaged in? They are engaged in abandoning the bonds of the household, the snares and traps of worldly life, and transforming their actions, which are tainted by sin, to follow restraint. The essence of the soul is called Atmatva. Atmatva is being free from the stains and darkness of all karmas. For this purpose, the Sadhu should be vigilant and aware. Or, Atmatva is the name of liberation or restraint, it is indicative. Therefore, the Sadhu should be engaged in all ways and in all aspects in following restraint for the attainment of liberation. He should be very vigilant in the actions of following restraint. This is the meaning:

**I**
**Om Om Om**
**Tamege**
**Paribhasanti,**
**Bhikkhuyam Saahujiviinam. Paribhasanti, Antar Te Samahie.** || 8 ||
**Evam**
**Chhaya Tameke Paribhasante, Bhiksukam Saadu Jiviinam. Ya Evam Paribhasante, Antake Te Madheh.**

**Translation:** Many followers make accusations about the Sadhu who is engaged in his livelihood with the highest restraint, which will be discussed later, but these accusations are far from the path of Samadhi.

**Commentary:** What has been said in the Niyukti about the despondency of the mind of a cowardly person, that has been said. Now, the second meaning is being discussed, regarding the words of the opponents, "Miti Sadhum." Those who have attained a vision that is devoid of mutual benefit, like iron rods, they are the followers of the Goshalak doctrine, the Digambara, or the Ajivika. They speak about the Bhikshu, the Sadhu, the virtuous, the good, the one who lives a life of benefit to others, "Ye" those who are not well-established in Dharma, "Evam" what will be said, "Paribhasante" they make accusations against virtuous conduct, those who are like this, "Antake" until the end, "Samadheh" they are far from liberation, from right knowledge, or from good practice. || 8 || To show what they speak, it is said:

**Commentary:** It has been explained in the Niyukti that after accepting restraint, despondency and sorrow arise in the mind of a cowardly person. How does this happen? This has been explained in the previous verses. Now, what accusations do the followers make about the Sadhus, this is the second meaning. The Agamkar says in this regard: Just as iron rods do not meet each other, they remain separate, similarly, those who wander separately, those who believe in a vision where mutual benefit is not prescribed, some other-worldly, those who have faith in the Ajivika doctrine, the followers of the Goshalak doctrine, or the Digambara tradition, they speak accusatory words about the Sadhus who live a virtuous life, full of benefit to others, which will be said later.

They criticize and condemn the conduct of the Sadhus. They are far from Samadhi, liberation, right knowledge, or good practice. The scripture explains about those other followers who speak accusatory words.

The text criticizes Jain ascetics, claiming their conduct is similar to householders. It uses the term "sambaddha-samakalpa" to describe this, meaning "bound by similar conduct" to householders. The text argues that ascetics are attached to each other, like householders are to their families, as evidenced by their caring for sick ascetics. It then uses the term "saragattha" to describe ascetics as being "attached to passion," implying they are not truly detached from worldly desires. This, the text argues, prevents them from achieving liberation from the cycle of rebirth.

Page #260:
---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra
**Commentary:** "Thus" you, like householders, are attached to desires - you live with desire, hence you are called "sragastha" - one who dwells in that nature. You are mutually dependent on each other, which is not appropriate because the monks of the Jain order are free from attachments, they are not dependent on anyone. This is the way of householders. You are also deprived of the true path, the path of righteousness and the ultimate goal. You are not beyond the cycle of birth and death in the four realms of existence.

This is the opposing view. To refute it, it is said:

**Commentary:** "Then" the monk, who is a master of liberation, should address them. What kind of monk? One who is a master of the path of liberation, who is a guide to the right faith and conduct. "Thus" you, who are speaking in this way, are indulging in the wrong side, the wrong view, which is based on false claims and assumptions. You are indulging in both sides - the side of desire and hatred. Desire arises from the support of your own side, even if it is flawed. Hatred arises from the criticism of our side, even if it is flawless. Thus, you are indulging in both sides. For example, householders are called "yatis" because they are initiated into the order, even though they are engaged in the activities of sowing seeds, watering, and eating. Thus, you are indulging in both sides. Or, it could be that you are not practicing the right path yourself, and you are criticizing those who are practicing it.

**Translation:** "Then" the monk, who is a master of liberation, should address them. "Thus" you, who are speaking in this way, are indulging in the wrong side, the wrong view, which is based on false claims and assumptions.

## The Study of Prefixes

The second meaning of "dukkha" used in the verse, its Sanskrit shade, according to the two-sided view, also has two sides. Accordingly, you consume the two sides of raga (attachment) and dvesha (aversion). Although your side is flawed, you still support it due to the delusion attached to it. This is your raga towards your own side. Our principle is flawless and impeccable, yet you label it as flawed. This is your dvesha towards it. Or, there is also a form of consuming two sides by you people. You are householders, similar to householders, because you consume the seeds, water, and food made for your purpose. By wearing the robe of a sadhu, you are similar to a sadhu. This is the consumption of two sides by you. Or, you yourselves perform asat anusthana (unrighteous practices) and savadya karma (flawed actions), and you criticize those who perform sat anusthana (righteous practices), nirvadya (flawless), papa-rahit (sinless), and uttama karya (excellent actions). This is also a type of consuming two sides. This is the meaning.

**Verse 12:**

> You eat from vessels, and you bring food for the sick sadhu from the houses of householders. You consume seeds, water, and food made for your purpose.

**Shade:**

**Translation:**

> You people eat from vessels made of bronze and other metals, and you bring food for the sick sadhu from the houses of householders. You consume seeds, water, and food made for your purpose.

**Objection:**

> Other tirthankaras say, "You eat from vessels, and you bring food for the sick sadhu from the houses of householders. You consume seeds, water, and food made for your purpose."

**Commentary:**

> To explain the incorrect conduct of the Ajivikas, other tirthankaras, and the Digambaras, the sutrakara says, "You people claim to be aparigrahi (non-possessive) and nishkinchana (without possessions). But even while saying and accepting this, you eat from the vessels of householders, made of bronze and other metals. By consuming from their vessels, you inevitably incur the fault of possession. Moreover, you have an attachment to food and other things. Therefore, how can your claim of being aparigrahi be considered flawless and impeccable? You also bring food for the sick sadhu, who is unable to beg for alms, from the houses of householders. Because of the lack of change in the way of a sadhu, and because of the fault of bringing food from householders, this fault is inevitable for you. The sutrakara points this out: You consume food obtained from householders, using seeds, water, and other things as examples. You consume food made for your purpose, which is inevitably for your consumption. Therefore, you eat from the houses of householders, using their vessels, and you also bring food for the sick sadhu from the houses of householders. Thus, you are inevitably consumers of seeds, water, and food made for your purpose."

**Further:**

Page #262:
---------------------------
The Sutrakar says that you consume food prepared from seeds and grains, and water, which is prepared through the process of crushing, grinding, and cooking. This food is prepared for the sick and ailing monks, and it is also consumed by you. In this way, you consume food prepared from seeds and grains, and water, and you also consume food that is prepared for a specific purpose, while eating in the homes of householders, and while being served by them.

The Sutra says: "You are bound by intense heat, you are devoid of right understanding, and you are not in a state of concentration. Scratching a wound too much is not beneficial, because it causes harm."

The commentary explains that you are bound by intense heat, which is the result of karma, because you consume food that is prepared for the sick and ailing monks, and because you hold onto false views, and because you criticize the monks. You are devoid of right understanding because you do not carry a begging bowl, and you eat in the homes of householders, and you consume food that is prepared for a specific purpose. You are not in a state of concentration because you hate the virtuous monks.

The commentary further explains that just as scratching a wound too much is not beneficial, because it causes harm, so too is it not beneficial for you to be devoid of right understanding, and to claim that you are without possessions, while abandoning the begging bowl, which is a tool for restraint, and which protects the six classes of beings. By abandoning the begging bowl, you are consuming impure food, and this is not beneficial.

Page #263:
---------------------------
The study of the prefixes is essential - it must be done. Therefore, without regard to the substance, space, time, and emotion, just as it is not advisable to scratch a wound excessively, it is also not advisable to abandon the tools of restraint.
Those who are instructed in the truth, know it without any promise. This path is not fixed, nor is it a speech without consideration.
Translation - Those who are instructed in the truth - the knower of the true truth, the explainer, the one who understands the objects to be abandoned and the objects to be adopted as they are, the right-seeing Muni, while giving good instruction, says that the path you have made your own is not fixed, just, or proper. The accusations you make against the virtuous are also all devoid of moment-to-moment contemplation and deliberation.
-
Commentary - Moreover - 'By the truth' - by the ultimate truth, by the intention of the silent ones, by the representation of the truth as it is, you, the followers of the views of Gosala, the Ajivikas, etc., or the Botikas, are 'instructed' - you have received instruction through the perception of the defects of your assumptions. By whom? - By the one who makes no promise - 'I do not have this promise - even if it is true, it is worthy of support' - the one who makes no promise - the virtuous one who is free from attachment and aversion, 'knows' - the meaning is that he is able to distinguish between the objects to be abandoned and the objects to be adopted. How are they instructed? - The path that you have adopted, as the ascetics are free from possessions, therefore they should not have any tools, nor should there be a feeling of mutual benefit and benefactor - one should not serve or care for each other. This view of yours is 'not fixed' - not definite, not logical. Therefore, this speech, as one brings food to a sick person and gives it to him, they are like householders. This is 'unconsidered - hidden' - spoken without consideration, as well as the action: 'Your action is also unconsidered, just as your practice is unconsidered, so it is not excessively scratched' - this has been explained earlier, and now it is being repeated again with an example. As promised, he says
235
-
Commentary - The truth is what is actually true, what is in accordance with the intention of the Jina, that is, to represent a substance as it is, that is the truth. By this, the followers of Gosala, the Ajivikas, and the Digambaras are instructed - taught. By pointing out the defects in their views, they are made to understand the true meaning, they are explained. By whom is the instruction given? This question is raised and it is said that the instruction is given by the one who makes no promise. A false meaning is also supported by me, such a feeling is called a promise, the one who does not have it is called the one who makes no promise. The one who is free from attachment and aversion is the one who makes no promise, the one who is able to distinguish between the objects to be abandoned and the objects to be adopted, the one who is able to recognize them, gives instruction. How is the instruction given? This is being explained - the principle that you have accepted, that the ascetic is free from possessions, therefore he should not have any tools, nor should there be a feeling of mutual benefit and benefactor - one should not serve or care for each other. This view of yours is not fixed - definite or logical. What you say, that those who bring food to a sick ascetic are like householders, is your unconsidered, unthoughtful, or unthoughtful presentation. The actions you perform are also devoid of consideration and thought. In the thirteenth verse, 'naatikandu iy seyam' - 'naatikandu itam shreyam' - what is said by this phrase is explained by an example. The sutrakar says according to his previous discussion.

Page #264:
---------------------------
The Sutra of the Sutrakritanga says: "This kind of speech is like the tip of a bamboo, weak and useless. It is beneficial for the householder to receive food, but not for the monk to receive it."

Commentary: This statement is like the tip of a bamboo, weak and useless, because it is not logical to say that a monk should not receive food from a sick monk. The author of the Sutra clarifies this by saying that it is beneficial for the monk to receive food from a householder, but not from another monk. This statement is weak and useless because the food received from a householder is often tainted with the suffering of living beings, while the food received from a monk is free from such taints.

The Sutra continues: "The Dharma-teaching is the purifier of the worldly, but it is not something that was established in the past."

Commentary: The Dharma-teaching is the purifier of the worldly, because it teaches the householder to give to the monk, but not the other way around. This is because the monk is purified by his own practice, and does not need to receive gifts from others. The author of the Sutra argues that this teaching was not established in the past, because it is not logical to say that the monk should not receive gifts from the householder. The author argues that the monk should receive gifts from the householder, because the householder is motivated by compassion and the monk is motivated by the desire to practice the Dharma.

Page #265:
---------------------------
The study of the prefix (Upasarga) is for the purpose of commentary (Tika). It is said that one should benefit the ascetics by giving them donations and other things. This is a religious injunction (Dharmaprajnapana), a religious instruction (Dharmopadeśa) for householders (Grihastha) to purify them, not for the ascetics, because ascetics are purified by their self-restraint based rituals (Sanyama Mulaka Anushthan). Therefore, they do not have the right to receive donations. To prove this principle as flawed, the Sutrakar states that in situations like illness, householders should benefit the ascetics by providing them with food and other things, and they should take care of them. However, ascetics should not benefit each other in this way. In accordance with this view, the omniscient ones (Sarvagya) never preached Dharma in the past, because the omniscient great men (Sarvagya Mahapurusha) do not elaborate on such trivial and insignificant matters. For example, only unrestrained men (Asanyata Purusha) who do not have any use for things like desires (Eshana) would serve (Vyayavritya) an ill ascetic, but restrained men (Sanyata Purusha) who have use for such things would not do so. The omniscient ones cannot preach such things. You people also encourage householders to serve an ill ascetic. By approving this act in this way, you are accepting the benefitting of an ill ascetic. Thus, you are both benefiting an ill ascetic and opposing that act.

"All the arguments (Anuyukti) are unable to establish (Yapayitum) their point of view (Javittum). Therefore, rejecting (Nirakritva) the argument, they are bold (Pragalbhitah) again (Bhuyo)." (17)

Commentary (Tika): Those who follow the teachings of Goshalak (Digambara) are unable to establish themselves (Aatmanam Yapayitum) in their own point of view (Swapksha) with all the arguments (Arthānugata Abhiyuktī) and proofs (Hetudrishṭānta) that are in accordance with the meaning (Arthānugata). Therefore, they reject (Nirakritva) the argument (Vada) because they are unable to present it (Samarthya Bhavad) with proper arguments and proofs (Samyag Hetudrishṭānta). They, the Tirthikas, abandon (Parityaajya) the argument (Vada) and become bold (Pragalbhitah) again (Bhuyo) even after abandoning the argument (Vada). This is what they say: "The ancient (Puranam) human (Manava) Dharma, the Veda with its branches (Sanga), and the medical science (Chikitsitam) are the four things (Chatvari) that are not to be killed (Hantavya) by arguments (Hetubhih)." (1)

Furthermore, what is the purpose of this external (Bahiranga) argument (Yukti) based on inference (Anumana) etc. in the examination (Parikshana) of Dharma? Because, it is evident (Pratyaksha) that this Dharma is the best (Shreyas) and not another, as it is accepted by many people (Bahujanasammatatvena) and supported by kings (Rajadyashrayanacha). Those who argue this way (Evam Vivadante) are told this: "There is no purpose (Prayojanam) in this (Atra) with many (Bahuna) things that are devoid of essence (Sararahitena) like knowledge (Jnana) etc." It is said: "A heap (Rasi) of castor oil wood (Erandakaththara) is like a piece (Pala) of sandalwood (Gosirsha Chandana). It is not equal (Sarisa) in value (Mulyena) even if it is counted (Ganijanta) as much (Kiyantmatro)." (1)

"Even though (Tathapi) the excess (Atirego) in counting (Ganana) is like a heap (Rasi), it is not equal (Sarisa) to sandalwood (Chandana). Similarly (Tatha), a person (Mahajana) who is ignorant (Nirvijnana) also speaks (Vinsavayati) about the value (Mulyena)." (2)

Page #266:
---------------------------
English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra states: "One who has eyes is better to be seen than many who are blind." (3) Meaning: One who has vision is better to be seen than many who are blind.

Further, "Thus, even the many who are deluded do not know the measure of the path. The wandering in the Samsara is crooked, as is the bondage and liberation." (4) Meaning: Thus, even the many who are deluded do not know the measure of the path. The wandering in the cycle of rebirth (Samsara) is crooked, as is the bondage and liberation.

Moreover, when the proponents of the Goshala school of thought and the followers of the Digambara tradition are unable to establish their position with appropriate means of knowledge such as valid reasons and examples, then they abandon the debate and instead boldly assert that the Puranas, Smritis (scriptures), the Vedas with their Angas, and Ayurveda (the science of life) are scriptures validated by the command of the Omniscient Lord. Therefore, they claim, these should not be refuted through reasoning. What is the need for external means like logic and inference to examine the religion, since our religion is the best, being accepted by many people and honored by kings and emperors? Other sects engage in futile debates and make such audacious claims, which should be responded to in this manner.

Dharmas (religious practices) devoid of the essence of knowledge are many. Even if accepted by many, they do not serve any purpose. Just as a large heap of castor oil plant wood is not worth even a small measure of fragrant sandalwood, similarly, the multitude of ignorant people, despite their large number, are not equal to the few who possess knowledge and discrimination.

"Overcome by attachment and aversion, deluded by false beliefs, they take refuge in abuse, like the barbarians taking refuge in the mountain." (18) Meaning: Overcome by attachment and aversion, deluded by false beliefs, when the proponents of other doctrines are defeated in the discussion of the principles, they take refuge in abuse, just like the barbarians taking refuge in the mountain.

##  The Study of Prefixes - Commentary

**Raga** is defined as **priti** (pleasure), and **dvesha** is defined as the opposite of **sad** (good), meaning **apriti** (displeasure). Those who are overwhelmed by their **atma** (soul) by **raga** and **dvesha**, and who are **abhidruta** (overwhelmed) by **mithyatva** (falsehood) and **viparayasta** (inverted) **bodhe** (understanding), are **vyapta** (permeated) by **tattvadhyavasaya** (firm conviction in truth). They are unable to engage in **vad** (debate) with **sadhyuktibhir** (proper arguments). Driven by **krodha** (anger), they resort to **akroshan** (outbursts) in the form of **asabhyavachana** (unrefined speech), and even engage in **hanan vyapara** (acts of violence) with **dandamushtayadibhis** (sticks, fists, etc.).

To illustrate this point, the sutrakar (author) provides an example: Just as **tankana** (a specific type of mleccha - non-Aryan) are difficult to conquer, and when they are driven away by a powerful force with their own army, they are unable to fight with various weapons and seek refuge in the mountains, similarly, **kutirthika** (those who follow false doctrines) are defeated in **vad** (debate) and, overwhelmed by **krodha** (anger), resort to **akrosha** (outbursts), **apshabda** (abusive language), and other such things. One should not retaliate with insults, just as:

"**Akko sahaṇaṇa maraṇa dhamma bhamsaṇa bal sulabhaṇa. Labha mannai dhiro jahuttarana abhava mi.** (1)" (18)

**Shadow:** **Akrosha** (outbursts), **hanan** (killing), **marana** (death), **dharma bhamsha** (destruction of dharma), are all **bal sulabha** (easy for the weak), and a wise person considers it **labha** (benefit) to not engage in them, as they are **abhava** (absence) of **jahuttarana** (higher qualities).

**Commentary:** **Priti** is called **raga**. Its opposite, **apriti**, is called **dvesha**. Those whose **atma** (soul) is overwhelmed by **raga** and **dvesha**, and who are **abhidruta** (overwhelmed) by **mithyatva** (falsehood) and **viparayasta** (inverted) **bodhe** (understanding), are **vyapta** (permeated) by **tattvadhyavasaya** (firm conviction in truth). They are unable to engage in **vad** (debate) with **sadhyuktibhir** (proper arguments). Driven by **krodha** (anger), they resort to **akroshan** (outbursts) in the form of **asabhyavachana** (unrefined speech), and even engage in **hanan vyapara** (acts of violence) with **dandamushtayadibhis** (sticks, fists, etc.).

One should not retaliate with insults. **Akrosha** (outbursts), **hanan** (killing), **marana** (death), **dharma bhamsha** (destruction of dharma), are all **bal sulabha** (easy for the weak), and a wise person considers it **labha** (benefit) to not engage in them, as they are **abhava** (absence) of **jahuttarana** (higher qualities).

**Bahugunappgappai, kuja attasamahie... Jene ane no virujheja, tene tan tan samaya re.** (19)

**Shadow:** **Bahuguna** (many virtues) should be cultivated by one who is **attasamadhi** (in self-absorption). One should act in a way that does not provoke others.

**Translation:** When a muni (sage) engages in **vad** (debate) with another **tirthi** (pilgrim), he should remain in **attasamadhi** (self-absorption), keeping his **chittavritti** (mental fluctuations) calm. He should present arguments, examples, and conclusions in a proper manner to establish his own position and refute the opponent's position. He should engage in conversation in a way that does not make the other person his opponent.

**Commentary:** **Bahuguna** (many virtues) such as **svapksha sidhi** (establishment of one's own position), **paradoshodbhavana** (revealing the opponent's flaws), **madhyasthya** (mediation), etc., are **prakalpanta** (manifested) in the **atma** (soul) of one who practices them. These **bahuguna prakalpana** (manifestations of many virtues) are **prajna** (wisdom) for **pratijna** (pledge), **drishtanta** (example), **upanaya** (application), **nigamana** (conclusion), etc., as well as **madhyasthya vachana** (words of mediation). These practices are **sadhu** (good) during **vadakala** (time of debate) or at other times. One who cultivates **atma samadi** (self-absorption), which is **chitta svasthya** (mental well-being), is **vishistyate** (distinguished).

Page #268:
---------------------------
The Sutra of the Sutra-Kritanga says: "He who attains self-absorption through the use of reasons, examples, etc., or through the use of words that are impartial and do not harm others, should do that. Similarly, he who, by his actions or words, or by hearing the teachings of the Tirthankaras, causes others to be inclined towards the Dharma without causing any conflict, should do that which does not cause conflict with others. He should perform actions or speak words that are not contrary to the Dharma." (19)

Commentary: Those actions that lead to the establishment of one's own position and the refutation of the opposing position, or that lead to impartiality and freedom from bias, are called "Bahuguna-Prakalpa." This includes the use of affirmations, reasons, examples, applications, and conclusions, or the use of words that are impartial and free from bias. Therefore, a virtuous person should act in this way when engaging in debate or discussion with others, or at other times. The Sutra-kar, describing the characteristics of such a virtuous person, says: "He whose mind is serene and tranquil is called 'Atma-Samadhi.'" The meaning is that one should use reasons, examples, etc., that lead to self-absorption and the establishment of one's own position, or speak words that are impartial and do not cause any suffering to others. A virtuous person should act in such a way that others who are inclined towards the Dharma, or other individuals, are not made hostile by his actions or words.

This Dharma, taught by Kashyapa, should be followed. A monk, with a tranquil mind, should serve a sick monk without any aversion. (20)

Shadow: This Dharma, taught by Kashyapa.

Translation: A monk, with a tranquil mind, should serve a sick monk without any aversion.

Commentary: Thus, refuting the views of others, the Agama-kar, in the concluding part, establishes his own position. He says: "This Dharma," which will be described later, "saves beings from falling into hell." This Dharma was taught by the Lord Mahavira, who, having attained divine knowledge (Kevala-Jnana), expounded it to the assembly of gods and humans. The word "cha" (also) in the verse indicates that he refuted the doctrines of other schools of thought and then expounded the Dharma. Accepting this Dharma, a monk who observes the vow of begging for alms should serve another monk who is weak, incapable, and sick. How should he serve him? This is explained: He should serve him with a tranquil mind, free from aversion, to the best of his ability. This means that as one's own mind becomes tranquil, one should not be discouraged by the difficulties that arise from the practice of yoga. Similarly, as the sick monk's mind becomes tranquil, he should be given food and other necessities. (20)

The study of *upasarga* (obstacles) is a way to generate *samadhi* (meditation) in one's own soul. If one is unable to do this due to *apatuta* (incompetence) or *ayogyata* (inability), then the *sadhu* (saint) becomes incapable of doing it themselves. When this happens, their work does not proceed as it should. Therefore, just as one should generate *samadhi* in their own soul, one should also generate *samadhi* in the soul of the sick person, and give them food and other things accordingly.

 Translation: The wise one, the seer of the true nature of things, the tranquil muni, knowing this excellent Dharma, should practice restraint, enduring the *upasarga* (obstacles) until he attains liberation. I say so.
 
 Commentary: To show what is to be done in this dilemma, the sutra-kāra says: "Knowing what? *Dharma*, the well-defined, distinct *śruta* and *cāritra* (scripture and conduct) established by the omniscient one, which is *pesala* (excellent), pleasing to beings due to its practice of non-violence, etc. What is this? It is explained: *darśana* (vision) is *dṛṣṭi* (sight), which is the correct vision of the true nature of things. He in whom this exists is *dṛṣṭimān* (the seer), meaning he who understands the nature of things as they are. Similarly, *parinirvṛta* (tranquil) is one who is free from attachment and aversion, and is peaceful. Thus, knowing this excellent Dharma, the seer, the tranquil muni, should endure the *upasarga* (obstacles), both favorable and unfavorable, by controlling them, not being overcome by them, and not doing anything inappropriate. Thus, he should strive for *āmokṣa* (liberation), the destruction of all karma, until he attains it. *Parivrajed* (he should practice restraint) means he should be engaged in the practice of restraint. *Bravīmi* (I say so) is used here to indicate completion, as before. || 21 ||

 Commentary: What should the *sadhu* (saint) do in this way? To show this, the sutra-kāra says: The *sadhu* should know and assimilate the *śruta* and *cāritra* (scripture and conduct) established by the omniscient one, knowing that it is well-defined, well-organized, and defined by vows, etc., and that it is pleasing to beings because it is inclined towards non-violence, etc., as will be explained later. What kind of *sadhu* is this? It is explained: To see the true nature of things, to have faith in it, is *samyak darśana* (right vision), which is called *dṛṣṭi* (sight). He in whom this exists is called *dṛṣṭimān* (the seer). In other words, the man who knows the true nature of things is *dṛṣṭimān*. Such a man is called *parinirvṛta* (tranquil). Thus, knowing the excellent Dharma, the seer, the tranquil, peaceful muni, should endure the favorable and unfavorable *upasarga* (obstacles). When there is an obstacle or difficulty in enduring the *upasarga*, he should not do anything that is not appropriate. Thus, the muni should be fully engaged in the practice of restraint until he attains liberation, the result of the destruction of all karma. The word *iti* here is used to indicate completion. *Bravīmi* should be connected as before.
 
 The third section of the *Upasarga parijñā* (knowledge of obstacles) is complete.

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Fourth Uddeshaka of Sri Sutrakritanga Sutram
This has a connection with the previous Uddeshaka - in the previous Uddeshaka, the favorable and unfavorable Parisahas (adversities) were expounded. It is apprehended that the Sadhu may fall from his Shila (vows) being afflicted by those Upasargas (adversities). The instruction given by the Sadhu who has fallen from Shila (vows) is described in this Uddeshaka. This is the first Sutra of this Uddeshaka presented in this context.

Verse 1:
Aaharnsu Mahapurisaa, Puvvim Tappatapodhana. Udaena Siddhimaavanna, Tattha Mando Viseedati.
Translation: The ignorant and unwise people say that in the past, there were great ascetics who had performed severe austerities. They attained Siddhi (spiritual accomplishment) by consuming water, but there the ignorant person grieves.

Tika (Commentary):
Some who are unaware of the ultimate truth say this. Who are they? The great persons, the principal ascetics like the Valkala-clad Rishis and others. What did they say? That in the past, they had performed severe austerities, and by consuming water (as an uplifting practice), they attained Siddhi (spiritual accomplishment). Hearing this, the ignorant person, who is afflicted by the consumption of hot water and not bathing, becomes distressed in the practice of Samyama (self-restraint). Or, he grieves in the very consumption of cold water, i.e., he gets immersed in it. But he does not understand that those ascetics had attained Right Vision through some cause, and their Jnanavaraniyadikarma (knowledge-obscuring karmas) were destroyed, just as Bharat and others attained Moksha, not merely by consuming cold water.

## Translation:

**Verse 2:**

**Text:**

* **Namivaidehi** did not eat, **Ramgupta** ate.
* **Bahuk** drank cool water, **Narayana** drank water.

**Translation:**

* **Namivaidehi**, the king of the **Videha** country, attained liberation without eating.
* **Ramgupta** attained liberation while eating.
* **Bahuk** attained liberation by drinking cool water.
* **Narayana** attained liberation by drinking water.

**Commentary:**

* Some people who follow false doctrines try to deceive the virtuous by saying that **Namivaidehi**, the king of the **Videha** country, attained liberation without eating.
* They also say that **Ramgupta**, a king-sage, attained liberation while eating.
* They also say that **Bahuk** attained liberation by consuming cool water.
* They also say that **Narayana**, a great sage, attained liberation by consuming water.

**Verse 3:**

**Text:**

* **Asilo**, **Devila**, **Dvaipayana**, and **Parashara** ate seeds and green plants.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra - English Translation

**Verse 4:**

These great men of the past, are well-known and accepted here. They attained liberation after consuming seeds and water with consciousness. This is what I have heard.

**Commentary:**

The Sutra-maker says this to show that these great sages, like Nami, were well-known in the past, in the Treta and Dvapara yugas. They were known as great men, or principal men, and were famous as Rajarshis. Some of them are also accepted in the teachings of the Rishis, like the Arhata Pravachana. This is what the Kutirthikas or their followers say. For example, all of them attained liberation after consuming seeds, water with consciousness, etc. This is what I have heard in the Mahabharata and other Puranas.

**Verse 5:**

The weak-minded are disheartened, like donkeys burdened with heavy loads. They crawl on their backs, like a cripple who clings to pieces of wood, and tries to follow others in fear of fire or other dangers, but cannot move.

**Commentary:**

The Sutra-maker says that in the face of such teachings, the weak-minded, who are ignorant and unable to understand the various ways to attain liberation, are disheartened. They are unable to practice restraint. For example, those who have attained liberation, may have experienced the recollection of their past births, or the loss of their right knowledge and conduct, like the loss of a garment. But they will never attain the destruction of karma through the consumption of cold water and seeds, which is like tormenting the soul. The Sutra-maker gives an example of a donkey burdened with a heavy load, who is exhausted and unable to move. Similarly, a cripple who clings to pieces of wood, tries to follow others in fear of fire or other dangers, but cannot move.

Page #273:
---------------------------
##  The Study of Obstacles

Obstacles arise, and even those who have abandoned the burden of restraint become cool-minded wanderers.  An example is given: Just as "back-crawlers" (creatures that crawl backwards), with broken limbs, in the midst of a fire, with eyes filled with fear, crawl backwards in search of safety, not leading the way, but perish in the midst of the fire, so too, those who are cool-minded, though they are inclined towards liberation, do not attain liberation, but remain in this very world for an infinite period of time. || 5 ||

To refute another view, the author presents the opposing argument.

**Commentary:**  Those who hold the view of false vision, who have been taught by the ignorant and the misguided, when faced with the above-mentioned obstacles, think, "Liberation is attainable through many means, how can we become liberated?"  They experience difficulty in following restraint.  These ignorant ones do not know that the men who attained liberation, due to some reason, experienced the manifestation of their past lives, such as the recollection of their caste, which led them to right faith and conduct, through which they were liberated.  Similarly, those who renounced their outer garments (Valkalachiri) attained liberation.  Without the renunciation of all possessions, the ultimate goal of self-transformation, and the restraint of emotions, liberation through the destruction of karma, which is impossible without the consumption of water containing living beings, and the use of seeds, etc., can never be attained.

The author, through an example, explains the state of those who experience difficulty in following restraint due to the teachings of those who hold the view of false vision:  Just as a weak donkey experiences pain while carrying a load, so too, the aforementioned virtuous ones experience pain while following restraint.  The donkey drops the load on the way and falls itself.  Similarly, the aforementioned virtuous ones abandon the burden of restraint and become lax in their conduct.  In this regard, the author gives another example:  Just as a lame person, when a fire breaks out, becomes frightened, his eyes become filled with fear, and he tries to escape like those who are fleeing the fire, but he cannot move forward, and is consumed by the fire, so too, the lax person, though he is inclined towards the path of liberation, does not reach it.  He wanders in this world for an infinite period of time.

"They say that happiness is attained through happiness, they are ignorant.  Those who abandon the path of the Aryas, which leads to the ultimate state of meditation, are unwise."

**Commentary:**  To refute another view, the author presents the opposing argument:  "They" - referring to those who are considering the path to liberation - "say" - the Shakyas and others, who are afflicted by their own group or by their eyes, etc.  The word "tu" (also) emphasizes the point, referring to the enjoyment of cold water, etc.  "They say" - they speak or think, according to some readings.  What do they say?  "Happiness" - "by happiness" - "it exists" - it becomes.  Thus, they become speakers of the following:

"All beings are attached to happiness, all beings arise from suffering.  Therefore, one who desires happiness should give happiness, the giver of happiness obtains happiness." || 1 ||

Page #274:
---------------------------
The Sutra of the Sri Sutra Kritanga states that the effect arises according to the cause. Just as a sprout of rice arises from a seed of rice, and not a sprout of barley, so here, from happiness, the happiness of liberation arises, and not from pain, such as eye disease, etc. Thus, the Agama also states the same:

"Manunna bhoyanam bhocca, manunna samanasanam. Manunnasin agaram si, manunna jhayaye muni." (1)

Commentary: Having eaten delicious food, the Muni should meditate in a comfortable bed, in a comfortable house. (2)

Similarly,

"Mridvi sayya pratarutthaya peya, bhaktam madhye panakam chaparahne. Drakshakhandam sarkara charrdharatre, mokshaschanthe shakyaputrena drishtah." (1)

Therefore, from delicious food and recreation, mental health arises, and from mental health, liberation is attained. Therefore, it is established that happiness is attained only through happiness, and never through pain, such as eye disease, etc. Thus, those who are confused, such as the Shakyas, etc., who reject the path of Jainism, which is the path of liberation, as stated in the Agama, when faced with the question of liberation, are ignorant and remain within the cycle of birth and death. For, what they say, that the effect arises according to the cause, is not absolute. For, an arrow arises from a horn, a scorpion from cow dung, a worm from a ball of dung, etc. Even though delicious food, etc., is presented as the cause of happiness, it is also subject to change, as it can lead to diseases like fever, etc. Moreover, this worldly happiness is merely an illusion of happiness, as it is a means of overcoming pain. As it is said:

"Dukhatmakeṣu viṣayeṣu sukhabhimānaḥ, saukyātmakeṣu niyamādiṣuduḥkhabuddhiḥ. Utkiṛṇavarṇapadapanktirivanyarūpā, sārupyamaiti viparītagatiprayogāt." (1)

Therefore, how can this worldly happiness be the cause of the ultimate happiness of liberation, which is the form of supreme bliss? Even though pain, such as eye disease, sleep, begging, hunger, thirst, bites, and itching, is presented as the cause of pain, this is only for those who are of low virtue. For those who are of great virtue, who are great men, who are devoted to their own interests, and who are focused on the ultimate truth, all this is for happiness. As it is said:

"Tanasantharaniviṇṇovi munivaro bhattharāgamayamaho. Jam pāvaimuttisūham katto tam chakkavaṭṭīvi?" (1)

Commentary: Even though the Muni is seated on a bed of grass, he is free from attachment, anger, and delusion. How can he attain the happiness of liberation, who is like a king?

"Dukham duṣkṛtasankṣayāya mahatām kṣānteḥ padam vairinaḥ, kāyasya aśucitā virāgapadavi samvegahetuḥ jarā. Sarvatyāga mahotsavāya maraṇam jātiḥ suhṛtprītaye, sampadbhiḥ paripūrītam jagadidaṁ sthānam vipatteḥ kutaḥ?" (1)

Moreover, if happiness were the only cause of happiness, then there would be no diversity in the cycle of birth and death. And, those who are in heaven, who are eternally happy, would be reborn there again, because they experience happiness. Similarly, those who are in hell would be reborn there again, because they experience pain. There would be no diversity in the cycle of birth and death, due to different births. And, this is not seen, nor is it desirable. Therefore, it is refuted.

Commentary: In order to refute the opposing view, the Sutrakar presents it as the opposing argument, saying that those who follow the Shakyas, etc., and those who are tormented by the pain of cutting their hair, etc., and their followers, say that happiness is attained only through happiness. Here, the word "tu" indicates that the previous verse describes the characteristics of the consumption of water, etc., with awareness. According to this, they state that happiness is attained only through happiness. All beings are attached to happiness and are distressed and troubled by pain. Therefore, those who seek happiness, who are seeking happiness,

## The Study of Precepts

"If you want to study precepts, know that happiness is only achieved through actions that are in accordance with the divine. Happiness is only attained by those who give happiness. This is logical because the cause produces the effect. Just as the seeds of superior rice varieties like Sali and Vasmati produce rice plants of the same quality, not barley, similarly, happiness in this world leads to the attainment of liberation-happiness in the next world. Acts like hair-plucking and fasting do not lead to liberation. The Agamas state: 'The Muni should meditate on beautiful, pleasant, and delightful things, and should have a beautiful bed, seat, and house.' It is also said: 'The Muni should sleep on a soft bed, drink milk and other beverages in the morning, eat rice in the afternoon, and consume panaka, asava, and madya in the third part of the day. In the middle of the night, he should consume grapes, raisins, and sugar. This ultimately leads to liberation.' This has been witnessed and experienced by the Buddha of the Shakyan lineage.

Pleasant food, entertainment, etc., create joy in the mind. Joy leads to concentration, and the mind becomes focused and stable. This leads to liberation. This proves that happiness leads to happiness. Hair-plucking and other bodily afflictions do not lead to liberation. Those who propagate such ideas, like the Shakyans and Buddhists, abandon the path of liberation, which is based on the complete renunciation of all that is harmful, as taught in the Jain scriptures. They are ignorant and foolish. They wander endlessly in the cycle of birth and death. Their claim that the effect is always in accordance with the cause is not absolute, because it is observed that the plant called Shringa-Song produces the reed called Shar-Sarakanda. Scorpions are born from dung. Grass grows from the hair of cows and sheep.

## The Truth

The claim that pleasant and delicious food is the cause of happiness is also flawed, because it can lead to diseases like cholera. In reality, the happiness that arises from worldly pleasures is not true happiness. It is said: 'To consider painful things as pleasurable and pleasurable vows and rules as painful is like seeing the letters of an inscription in reverse when the inscription is turned upside down.' In this way, we must understand the true nature of happiness and suffering. Therefore, how can painful worldly pleasures be the cause of liberation-happiness, which is the ultimate, absolute, and eternal state of bliss?

You have said that hair-plucking, sleeping on the ground, begging for alms, enduring insults, hunger, thirst, the pain of flies and mosquitoes, etc., are the causes of suffering. Those who have weak hearts and are not visionaries of the path of liberation, those who are not great souls and do not know the ultimate truth, those who are not dedicated to achieving it, and those who are not engaged in the practice of self-liberation, for them these things are not suffering. They have immense inner strength, which transforms these things into means of happiness. It is said: 'The Muni who renounces attachment, ego, and delusion, even if he sleeps on a bed of straw and grass, experiences the ultimate bliss of liberation. He can be called a universal emperor.' It is also said: 'Great souls are not distressed by suffering, but they are very happy knowing that suffering leads to the destruction of sins.' Forgiveness and tolerance destroy enmity."

Page #276:
---------------------------
The Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra is peaceful. The impurity and defilement of the body is the path of detachment, old age is the cause of forbearance, the renunciation of all things is the great festival for which to die is a great joy. Birth is only a source of joy for one's friends. For great souls, this whole world is filled with wealth. Where is there room for misfortune or sorrow?

Happiness arises only from happiness, to believe this, the state of this strange and diverse world does not come about, because those who dwell in heaven are eternally happy - they enjoy uninterrupted happiness. Due to the enjoyment of happiness, their rebirth should be in heaven itself. The beings who dwell in hell suffer only suffering, therefore their rebirth should be in hell itself. The beings who dwell in hell suffer only suffering, therefore their rebirth should be in hell. Therefore, the strangeness of the world, which is the result of beings going to different destinies according to their own karmas, cannot happen. This is neither scriptural nor desirable.

Do not despise this - the true Dharma. Do not be deceived by trivial, insignificant worldly pleasures and neglect this liberating happiness. If you do not abandon the wrong side, then abandon heaven etc. and you will regret it like a merchant who takes iron.

Commentary: 'Thus' the path of the Aryas, the teachings of the Jinas, the path of right faith, knowledge, conduct and liberation, is expounded. Those who are deluded by the delusion of 'happiness arises only from happiness' etc., 'despise' it, 'discard' it, 'by trivial' worldly happiness, do not 'destroy' 'much' ultimate happiness, the happiness called liberation. For, by pleasing food etc., there is an arousal of desire, and from that arousal, there is no mental health, but rather no concentration. Moreover, if you 'abandon' this 'wrong side' - the acceptance of the wrong side - 'in the absence of liberation', you will 'regret' yourself like a merchant who takes iron. Just as he who takes iron, even though he finds silver and gold along the way, does not abandon it, saying, "I have brought this iron from so far, how can I abandon it now?" Later, when he reaches his destination and sells the iron, he regrets it. So too, you will regret it.

**Chāyā** - *Prāṇātipāte vartamānāḥ mṛṣāvāde'sanyatāḥ.*
*Adattādāne vartamānāḥ maithune ca pariggrahe.*
**Anuvāda** - You commit *prāṇātipāta* (killing of living beings), speak falsehood, take what is not given (theft), indulge in *abrahmacarya* (sexual misconduct) and accumulate possessions. Thus, you are not *sanyatācārī* (practitioner of self-restraint).
**Tīkā** - Again, to show the faults of the *Śākyas* who say "seven by seven", the sūtrakāra says - You are *asanyata* (unrestrained) because you engage in *prāṇātipāta*, *mṛṣāvāda*, *adattādāna*, *maithuna* and *pariggraha*. You are *vartamānasukhaiṣī* (desiring present pleasures) and for the sake of a small amount of worldly pleasure, you are destroying the true, absolute and ultimate happiness of liberation. Why? Because you commit *prāṇātipāta* by engaging in activities like cooking and getting food cooked. The bodies of the beings whose bodies you consume are not given to you by their owners, so you are engaging in *adattādāna* (theft). By keeping cows, buffaloes, camels, etc., and enjoying their sexual union, you are indulging in *abrahmacarya*. You say "We are *pravrajita* (renounced)", but you are engaged in the practices of householders. This is *mṛṣāvāda* (falsehood) on your part. You possess wealth, grain, bipeds (two-legged creatures), quadrupeds (four-legged animals), etc., so you are *pariggraha* (possessor).
Now, to show the faults of other views, the sūtrakāra presents the opposing view.

Shri Sutrakritanga Sutram:

Some unrighteous ones who are dwelling by the side (of the true path), who have fallen away from the Jain doctrine, are attached to women. They are ignorant youths who have turned away from the Jain doctrine.

Commentary:
The word 'tu' is used here to indicate a special distinction from the previous statement. Some misguided individuals, either those who have deviated from the true Jain path or those who are separate from their own community or religious tradition, are attached to women who are weak in knowledge. They are ignorant youths who have turned away from the Jain doctrine.

These individuals say: "Let there be only the sight of the beloved, what is the use of other sights? Even with a passionate mind, one attains nirvana through her." They say this because they are under the control of women and are afflicted by attachment and aversion. The Jinas (enlightened beings) have conquered attachment and aversion, but these individuals are averse to the Jain path and are engrossed in worldly attachments, as described in the upcoming verses.

Page #279:
---------------------------
Upasargadhyayana Translation - They say that just as relieving and draining the pus from a boil, carbuncle or abscess provides temporary relief, similarly, engaging in sexual relations with women who solicit intimacy brings peace from sorrow. How can there be any fault in this act?

Tika - The purpose of the example given here is to explain the statement made earlier. 'Just as' refers to the manner in which a certain person who has a boil, carbuncle or such lesion on the body, by 'pressing' it, drains out the pus and contaminated blood, and feels relieved for a moment, without incurring any fault, similarly, in the case of 'solicitation by women' (for sexual relations), how can there be any fault in the act of sexual intercourse, like the draining of the 'boil'? For, merely by the alleviation of distress, there would be no fault.

Tika Artha - What has been suggested by those of other faiths in the previous verse, is being explained in this verse. The word 'yatha' (just as) here is to provide an example. Just as a person who has a boil, abscess or such lesion on the body, by pressing it, drains out the pus and contaminated blood, and experiences relief for a moment, without incurring any fault, similarly, in the case of engaging in sexual relations with a young woman who solicits intimacy, how can there be any fault? Merely by the alleviation of one's distress or sorrow through sexual intercourse, there would be no fault.

Jha mandhadae naam, thimiam bhanjati dakam. Evam vinnavanitiisu, doso tattha kao siya? (11) - Just as the sheep named Mandhadana drinks the still water without disturbing it, in the same way, in the case of women who solicit, how can there be any fault there?

Tika - There would be a fault there if there was any harm caused. But since there is no such harm, the example is given - 'Just as' this is the purpose of the example. 'Mandhadana' is the name of a sheep. The word 'nama' here indicates a possibility. The meaning is that just as the sheep Mandhadana drinks the still water without disturbing it, and does not cause any harm to other beings, similarly, in the case of sexual relations with soliciting women, there is no harm caused to anyone, and one's own satisfaction is obtained, therefore, how can there be any fault in this?

Page #280:
---------------------------
English translation preserving Jain terms:

Just as the Pingala bird, a type of hawk, drinks water calmly without disturbing it, in the same way, there is no fault in having relations with entreating women, as it does not cause harm to any living being and they are satisfied.

Commentary: The purpose of providing this example is to demonstrate that just as the Pingala bird drinks water without agitating it, in the same way, having relations with entreating women, without causing harm to any living being and with them being satisfied, there is no fault in it. 

Just as someone, out of wickedness or ignorance, were to cut off someone's head with a weapon or drink poison, and yet maintain neutrality, they would not be free from fault. Similarly, in the case of the inevitable and all-encompassing evil of sexual intercourse, which increases the cycle of rebirth, how can one be free from fault?

As the great sages have said in the scriptures: "This (sexual intercourse) is harmful to living beings, like the entry of a heated iron rod. It is the root of unrighteousness and increases the cycle of rebirth. Therefore, one who does not wish for sin should avoid this evil."

This is the meaning conveyed by the three verses.

Page #281:
---------------------------
Upasargadhyayana Tika Artha - There is no fault of Pranimsa (violence against living beings) in engaging in sexual relations with a woman who is desirous of union, and many examples are presented here on this subject - Just as the bird named Kapinjala (Dove) residing in the sky drinks water without moving or shaking, similarly, a person who engages in sexual relations with a woman, with a mind devoid of attachment and aversion, for the purpose of procreation of offspring, is not blameworthy like the Kapinjala bird. 

Here, the beliefs of other Tirthankaras regarding Brahmacharya (celibacy) are mentioned - Some propound that just as pus or vitiated blood is extracted by pressing a boil, similarly, sexual relations with a woman are undertaken. Some say that just as a sheep drinks water without harming others, in the same way, Brahmacharya is pleasurable for both the man and the woman without causing pain to others. Similarly, there is a belief that the Kapinjala birds drink water from the lake without touching it with any part of their body except the beak, in the same way, a person who engages in sexual relations with his wife during the fertile period, with a mind devoid of attachment and aversion, for the purpose of procreation and not for fulfillment of lust, is not blameworthy.

They have said that a man who has the right over his wife, engaging in sexual relations with her during the fertile period for the purpose of Dharmic progeny, is a scriptural injunction, and there is no fault in it.

In this way, to refute the views of other doctrinal followers who are indifferent and detached from religious worship, three verses are presented as examples.

The essence of these three verses is that just as a person cannot escape the crime of beheading someone, consuming poison, or stealing precious jewels by adopting an indifferent or detached attitude, similarly, Brahmacharya, which is born out of passion, is the root cause of all faults, and it increases the cycle of birth and death. It cannot be considered faultless or blameless in any way. Scholars have said that Scriptures have described Brahmacharya as the destroyer and obstructer of living beings, just as placing burning embers inside a pipe destroys the objects within it, similarly, the practice of Brahmacharya destroys the spiritual strength. Brahmacharya is the root of unrighteousness and sin, and it increases the cycle of transmigration in the worldly existence. One who does not desire sin should renounce food as full of poison.

This is the meaning and essence of these three verses of Niyukti.

Now, the Sutrakara, while concluding this chapter, refutes the view of those who consider Brahmacharya pleasurable by comparing it to extracting pus from a boil.

Page #282:
---------------------------
The translation preserving the Jain terms is as follows:

The Śrī Sūtrakṛtāṅga Sūtra says that those who are Pārśvasthās (heretics), Mithyādṛṣṭis (those with false beliefs), and Anāryās (non-noble ones), are immersed in Kāmas (sensual pleasures), just like Pūtanā (a demoness) is attached to the young child.

The commentary explains that those who consider non-celibacy as faultless, are defeated by the Strīpariṣaha (the affliction of women) and stand apart from the path of virtue. They are the followers of the Nāthavāda sect. The term 'tu' (but) indicates that some of their own group also follow this doctrine, though they have a false and perverted understanding of the truth. They are far removed from all the condemnable virtues and hence are called Anāryas (non-noble ones) due to their conduct opposed to Dharma. Such individuals are deeply engrossed in sinful indulgences in Kāmas (sensual pleasures) or activities driven by Kāmas. 

The analogy given is that just as Pūtanā (a demoness) was attached to the young child, similarly these Anāryas are attached to sensual pleasures. Alternatively, the term 'Pūyaṇa' refers to a ewe that is excessively attached to its offspring. In the same way, these individuals are attached to their sense objects.

The study of the prefix (Upasargaadhyayanam) is like the story of the sheep who, hearing the cries of her lambs, wept. But blinded by her love for her children, she jumped into the well, not caring for death. This proves that the sheep has more love for her children than all other animals. In the same way, the work of the aforementioned other heretics proves their excessive attachment to enjoyment.

The Sutrakar explains the fault of men who are infatuated with pleasure.

"Those who do not see the future suffering, but seek the present pleasure, they will regret later, when their youth is gone and their life is waning." (14)

Commentary: "Anagatam" refers to the great suffering in hell and other places of torment, which arises from the non-abandonment of desires. "Apshyanta" means those who do not see or consider it. "Pratyutpanna" refers to the present worldly pleasures, which are merely an illusion of happiness. "Anveshayanto" means those who seek and desire these pleasures through various means. They will later regret, when their youth is gone and their life is waning, and they will be filled with sorrow and remorse. As it is said:

"Striking the sky with fists, and pounding husks without grain, is like the disrespect shown to the worthy, having obtained human birth." (1)

Also:

"Those who are adorned with wealth and youth, they act with youthful intoxication. When age comes, they remember those actions and their hearts are filled with sorrow." (1.14)

Commentary: Those who are not free from the desire for pleasure, who have not abandoned it, who do not see the suffering in hell and other places, who seek present worldly pleasures through various means, they will be filled with sorrow and regret when their youth is gone and their life is waning. They will lament and say, "Having obtained human birth, we did not respect the righteous and virtuous actions. It was our ignorance, as if we were striking the sky with fists and pounding husks without grain." The pride of wealth and the intoxication of youth lead to the neglect of good deeds, which are remembered when age comes, causing great distress to the heart.

"Those who do not regret later, they are wise and free from bondage, they do not live in vain." (15)

**Śrī Sūtrakr̥tāṅga Sūtraṃ**

**Chāyā** - Yaiḥ kāle parākrāntaṃ, na paścāt paritapyante.
Te dhīrā bandhonmuktaḥ, nāvakāṅkṣanti jīvitam.

**Anuvāda** - Those who have striven at the time when dharma should be striven for, do not regret afterwards, they do not have to repent, they are free from bondage, they are men of fortitude and strength, they do not desire a life without restraint.

**Tīkā** - These, being of the highest essence, undertake the effort of austerity, etc., at the right time, and do not regret afterwards. To show this, it is said, "Yaiḥ" - by those who are engaged in the welfare of the self, "Kāle" - at the time of earning dharma, "Parākrāntaṃ" - the effort is made to conquer the senses and passions, at the time of death or old age, "Paritapyante" - they do not become sorrowful. The singular number is due to the sūtra being a śloka. The time for earning dharma is, for the wise, practically all the time, because the earning of dharma is the main purpose of life. And the main purpose of life is, practically, always being accomplished. Therefore, those who, from childhood onwards, have not been in contact with worldly objects, and have been engaged in austerity, are "Dhīrāḥ" - capable of breaking the bonds of karma, they are free from the bondage of karma, which is full of attachment, and they do not desire "Nāvakāṅkṣanti" - a life without restraint. Or, they are indifferent to life and death, and are devoted to the effort of restraint.

**Anyaccha** -

**Tīkā-artha** - Those who are of the highest essence, and are very powerful, undertake the effort of austerity, etc., at the right time. They do not have to regret afterwards. To show this, the sūtra states, "Yaiḥ" - those who are engaged in the welfare of the self, "Kāle" - at the time of earning dharma, "Parākrāntaṃ" - those who have striven to conquer the senses and passions, do not become sorrowful afterwards, at the time of death or old age. The singular number used in the word "Paritapyante" is due to the sūtra being a śloka, and should be understood as an ārya usage. For those who are wise, practically all the time is the time for earning dharma, because the earning of dharma is the main purpose of life. Therefore, it is best to be engaged in the effort of the main purpose of life. Those who, from childhood onwards, have not been in contact with worldly objects, and have been engaged in austerity, are capable of breaking the bonds of karma, they are free from the bondage of karma, which is full of attachment, and they do not desire a life without restraint. Or, they are indifferent to life and death, and are devoted to the effort of restraint.

**Jha nāī vaneyaraṇī, duttarā iha sammatā. . . eṃ logaṃsi nāriyo, durūttara amaīmaya.**

**Chāyā** - Yathā nadī Vaitaraṇī dustareha sammatā.
Evaṃ loke nāryo dustarā amatimatā.

**Anuvāda** - Just as the Vaitaraṇī river is difficult to cross, so too are women difficult to cross for a man who is devoid of wisdom.

**Tīkā** - "Yathā" - the purpose of this is to give an example. Just as the Vaitaraṇī river is "Dustarā" - difficult to cross, because of its great speed and uneven banks, "Evaṃ" - so too in this world, women are "Amatimatā" - difficult to cross for those who are devoid of wisdom and of low essence. For they make even a learned man a woman by their allurements. And it is said:

##  Upasargaadhyayanam

**Verse 1:**

A man remains on the right path, controls his senses, and maintains modesty and humility, as long as the blue-feathered arrows of desire, shot from the bow of the eyebrows, aimed at the ears, do not strike his heart. 

**Commentary:**

Just as the river Vaitarani is difficult to cross due to its swift current and uneven banks, so too are women difficult to overcome for men who lack self-control and wisdom. They can easily ensnare even those who have mastered profound knowledge through their seductive gestures and desires. 

**Verse 17:**

Those men who have renounced the association and adornments of women, have overcome all obstacles, and remain in deep meditation.

**Commentary:**

Those who are wise and understand the consequences of associating with women, have abandoned such relationships. They have also renounced the use of clothing, ornaments, and garlands, which are meant to attract women. They have overcome all obstacles, including hunger, thirst, and other distractions, and have dedicated themselves to the path followed by great men. They remain in a state of deep meditation, their minds undisturbed by the allure of the world. Others, who are defeated by the temptations of women, are consumed by the fire of desire, like fish caught in a net and thrown onto burning coals. They are unable to achieve true meditation.

**Explanation:**

This section highlights the dangers of associating with women and the importance of self-control and renunciation for achieving spiritual liberation. It uses the metaphor of the Vaitarani river to illustrate the difficulty of overcoming worldly temptations. The commentary emphasizes the importance of following the path of great men and remaining in a state of deep meditation, free from the distractions of the world.

Page #286:
---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states that those who are **Manapriya** (dear to the mind) and are not shaken by **favorable and unfavorable circumstances** (**Praatikul-Apriya Upsargos**) are able to cross the ocean of existence.  Others, who are **Vishay-Lolup** (attached to worldly pleasures) and **defeated by temptations** (**Stri Adi Parishas**), are like fish on a burning coal, constantly burning in the fire of **Raga** (attachment) and experiencing **Ashanti** (restlessness). 

To explain the benefits of overcoming these temptations, the Sutrakar (author of the Sutra) says:

**"These will cross the ocean, like merchants who cross the sea. Where beings are distressed, they will be freed by their own actions." (18)**

**Commentary:**

Those who have overcome favorable and unfavorable circumstances, as described earlier, will cross the **Ogh** (ocean of existence), which is difficult to cross. This is like a merchant who crosses the **Samudra** (sea) using a boat. Similarly, **Yatis** (ascetics) will cross the ocean of existence using the boat of **Samyama** (self-control). They have already crossed and continue to cross. This **Ogh** is specifically described as the ocean of existence where beings are distressed due to attachment to **Stri** (women) and **Vishaya** (objects of desire). They suffer due to the **Asavendaniya** (unpleasant) results of their **Karma** (actions).

**The Sutrakar then continues with another teaching:**

**"The monk, knowing this, should walk the path of virtue. He should avoid false speech and refrain from taking what is not given." (19)**

Page #287:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Verse 19**

**Study of Prefixes:**  The monk, knowing and understanding what has been said in the previous verses, should abandon false speech (mṛṣāvāda) and theft (adattādāna) by being endowed with excellent vows and samitis.

**Commentary:**  As it has been said before, women are like the river Vaitaraṇī, difficult to cross. Those who have abandoned them, those who are in samadhi, cross over the cycle of birth and death. Those who are attached to women remain trapped in the cycle of birth and death and are tormented by their own actions. Knowing this, the monk, who is endowed with the vow of begging, should understand what is to be abandoned and what is to be accepted. He should practice restraint, being adorned with excellent vows and samitis. Here, the mention of being adorned with samitis is for the sake of mentioning the subsequent virtues. Thus, the virtuous monk should abandon false speech (mṛṣāvāda), which is speech that is not true, and should abandon theft (adattādāna). He should not even take a single blade of grass without permission. The word "ādi" here implies the abandonment of sexual misconduct and other such things. Therefore, for the sake of his own welfare, the monk should abstain from sexual misconduct and other such things for his entire life.

**Verse 20**

**Non-violence is the fence for other vows:**  The author of the sutras says this to explain the importance of non-violence.

**Shadow:**  Those who are moving (tras) and those who are stationary (sthāvara) in the upper, lower, and horizontal directions.

**Translation:**  One should refrain from violence towards all beings, whether they are moving (tras) or stationary (sthāvara) in the upper, lower, and horizontal directions. By doing so, the being attains peaceful liberation (nirvāṇa), as the scriptures say.

**Commentary:**  The phrase "above, below, and across" encompasses the killing of beings in all directions. Those who are moving (tras) are those who have two, three, four, or five senses, and who are different in terms of their ability to perceive. Those who are stationary (sthāvara) are those who are rooted in the earth, water, fire, air, and plants, and who are different in terms of their ability to perceive. This encompasses the killing of beings in all directions. The phrase "in all places, at all times, and in all states" encompasses the killing of beings in all directions. Thus, one should refrain from killing beings in all fourteen realms of existence, whether by action, speech, or thought. This verse, along with the previous verse, explains the fundamental virtues of non-violence and other virtues. Now, the author of the sutras explains the fruit of all these fundamental and subsequent virtues: "Peace" refers to the cessation of the burning of karma. "Liberation" (nirvāṇa) refers to the state of liberation, which is the cessation of all duality. This is what is said to be the state of the virtuous person who practices these virtues.

**Conclusion:**  This is the end of the study of all the verses.

Page #288:
---------------------------
##  **The Sutra Kritanga Sutra**

**Commentary:** Here, the terms "upward," "downward," and "across" are used to encompass the field of violence against living beings, which is categorized as violence within the field. Those beings who experience suffering, who appear to be suffering, are called "suffering beings." They are classified as having two, three, four, or five senses, and are further divided into those who are fully developed and those who are not fully developed. Those beings who do not move about, who remain stationary or immobile, are called "stationary beings." Among these stationary beings, there are distinctions such as earth, water, fire, air, plants, subtle beings, clouds, fully developed, and not fully developed. Here, while prohibiting violence against both suffering and stationary beings, the concept of "dravya pranatipat" (violence against the substance of life) is embraced. It is stated that one should not engage in violence against living beings at all times, in all situations. This is further elaborated by considering the distinctions of time and intention in relation to "pranatipat." Fourteen realms of existence are recognized. Within these realms, there are three types of actions: those committed, those caused, and those approved. Through the three yogas (mind, speech, and body), one should refrain from violence against living beings, thus abstaining from "pranatipat." This is explained in two verses, with one less line, which describe the fundamental virtues and their consequences. To elaborate on the fruits of these fundamental and consequential virtues, the fourth chapter states that the alleviation of the burning and scorching caused by karma is called "peace." This peace is the state of liberation or nirvana, where all suffering ceases. This state is attained by the virtuous, who diligently practice the right conduct.

**Summary of the meaning and intention of the entire study:**

**"Having received this Dharma, let it be known by Kashyapa. A monk, even when ill, should attend to the needs of another monk who is ill, without feeling any aversion or disgust." (Verse 21)**

**Shadow:**

+ + +

**"This Dharma has been proclaimed by Kashyapa. A monk, even when ill, should attend to the needs of another monk who is ill, with a mind free from aversion or disgust."**

**Translation:** Having embraced this Dharma, proclaimed by the Lord Mahavira, who belonged to the Kashyapa clan, a monk should remain in a state of meditation and attend to the needs of an ill monk, without feeling any aversion or disgust towards their illness.

**Commentary:** The phrase "having received this Dharma" refers to the fundamental and consequential virtues, as well as the Shrutacharitra, which is the path to liberation and the avoidance of suffering. This Dharma is received through the teachings of the Acharya (spiritual teacher). The commentary then explains the nature of this Dharma: it was proclaimed by the Lord Mahavira, who possessed divine knowledge and a desire to liberate all beings. A monk, who has attained this Dharma, should not be disturbed by external factors or difficulties, and should attend to the needs of another ill monk. How should they do this? They should do so with a mind free from aversion or disgust, and with a sense of equanimity, as if they themselves were not ill. This means that they should not think, "I have already achieved my goal," and then neglect their duty to care for the other monk.

Upasargadhyayanam. The ascetic believes that "I have fulfilled my duty, I am discharging my responsibility, and I am serving the ailing ascetic." 

Sankhaya pesalam dhammam, ditthi-mam parinivvude. Uvasagge niyamittā, āmokkkhāe parivvajjāsi ||22|| ti bemi. This is the third chapter on the knowledge of upasargas (adversities) in the context of right faith.

Translation: The one with right vision (samyagdrishti), peaceful (pesala), liberated (parinirvrta), thoroughly understands this dharma. Controlling the upasargas (adversities), he avoids them until he attains liberation.

Commentary: Having known rightly through one's own conviction or having heard from others, he embraces the dharma of scriptural conduct, which is conducive to liberation. Being endowed with right vision and tranquil due to the subsidence of passions, or being like one liberated, he patiently endures the favorable and unfavorable upasargas (adversities) until he attains liberation through the observance of restraint. The word "iti" here indicates the conclusion. I speak (bravimi), this pada is to be connected as before. The discussion of the point of view also remains the same.

The third chapter on the knowledge of upasargas (adversities) in the context of right faith is completed, and with its completion, this third adhyayana (study) is also complete.

**The Sutra Kritanga Sutra, Chapter Four, Study of Women**

**First Section**

He who has renounced his former connections with his mother and father, and all other attachments, will live alone, free from sexual desire, in secluded places. (1)

**Commentary:**

This section is connected to the previous Sutra, which states that a renunciant should strive for liberation. This liberation is only possible for one who has renounced all attachments. Therefore, this section discusses the renunciation of attachments.

The "he" refers to a virtuous soul who has renounced his mother, father, siblings, children, and all other past connections, as well as his in-laws and other future connections. He is free from all attachments and is devoted to knowledge, insight, and good conduct. He has vowed to live a life of restraint and will practice this vow in secluded places, free from women, animals, and eunuchs.

This section highlights the importance of renouncing all attachments and living a life of restraint. It also warns against the temptations of women, who may try to lure renunciants away from their path.

Page #291:
---------------------------
This is a study of women, which means that the ascetic investigates the observance of the vow of solitude, seclusion, or a place without women, animals, or eunuchs. This is what is said about what unwise women do to such a vowed, vowed, or self-controlled ascetic.
"They approach him subtly, with hidden words, these foolish women. They also know the means by which some monks become attached."
Commentary: "Suhumeṇam" etc., "tam" the great man, the ascetic, "sūkṣmeṇa" by means of an indirect statement, "chhalapadena" by means of deception, "parikramya" approaching him, or "ti" by means of overcoming him with the ability to fall from virtue, who? - "striyaḥ" like the sand of the riverbank, etc., skilled in various kinds of deception, like the Mágdha Ganikás, etc., with various kinds of cleverness, greedy for food, with their minds fixed on lust alone, devoid of the discrimination between right and wrong, approaching him, they destroy his virtue. This is what is said: by calling him "brother's son," they approach the ascetic and cause him to fall from his vow. And so it is said:
"Pīyaputta bhāikidaga ṇattūkidaga ya sayaṇakidaga ya. Ete jovvaṇakidaga pacchannpaī mahiliyāṇam."
Commentary: "Pīyaputta bhāikrīḍaka naptrīḍaka ca svajanakrīḍakaś ca ete yauvana kṛīḍakaḥ prāptāḥ pracchannpataḥ mahilānām."
Or, "channpaadena" - with a hidden name, as in:
"Kāle prasupta sya janārdana kṣya, meghāndhakārāsu ca śarvarīṣu. Mithyā na bhāṣāmi viśālanetre! Te pratyayā ve prathamākṣareṣu."
etc., those women are full of deceit, they also know the means of deception - they know it by their innate intelligence, or they are learned in other texts, as "śliṣyante" even wise ascetics become attached to such women because of the arising of such actions.
Commentary: The great man, the great ascetic, is approached by women under some pretext, with deceit, and they cause him to fall from virtue. Or, they make that great man capable of falling from celibacy and make him fallen. Just as the Mágdha Ganikás, etc., who are skilled in deceitful and deceptive actions, who are full of lust and desire, who are devoid of the discrimination between right and wrong, who are foolish and ignorant, have caused the Tapasas, etc., who are like the sand of the riverbank, etc., to fall from virtue, from celibacy, in the same way women cause the ascetics to fall from virtue. The meaning is that women, under the pretext of being a brother, son, etc., come close to the ascetic and cause him to fall from his vow. It is said: "Pīyaputra bhāi, nāti, etc., familial, worldly relationships are a pretext for women to secretly make a husband, they plot with hidden names, the following verse is an example of this:

English translation with Jain terms preserved:

The Sūtrakṛtāṅga Sūtra states - "When Janārdana (the Lord) is asleep in the darkness of the clouds and the nights, I do not speak falsehood, O wide-eyed one! Those are the experiences which are entangled in the meshes (of delusion)."

The meaning of this verse is as follows - When Janārdana (the Lord) or the Sun-god has gone to sleep, i.e., set, and the sky is covered with dark clouds, in those nights, I, the one with large eyes (the beloved), do not speak falsehood. The initial letters of each pada (section) of this verse spell out "Kāmen te", meaning "I desire you."

Skilled in the art of deception, women of a fickle mind know the ways of cheating, due to which even the discerning ascetics become attached to them because of the arising of karmic effects.

The verse states - "They sit down closely by his side, repeatedly put on the garment for nourishing (passion), display the lower part of the body, and approach him with uplifted arm exposing the armpit."

Commentary - The women, in order to deceive the ascetic, sit down very close to him, expressing excessive affection, with the intention of gaining his trust. Similarly, they repeatedly wear the garment that nourishes (arouses) passion, i.e., the attractive and seductive clothing, under the pretext of it being loose or wet. Further, they display the lower part of the body to arouse passion, and approach the ascetic with uplifted arm, exposing the armpit, in a manner favorable to him.

Additionally, the verse states - "With intoxicating substances and seductive means, they invite the solitary one. And he knows these, the evident and the hidden forms."

A woman, knowing the nature of men, invites them to a place with a comfortable bed and seat. A wise sage should recognize these as various forms of entrapment. 

**Commentary:** 

The term "shayanasana" refers to a place for lying down, such as a bed or a couch, while "asana" refers to a place for sitting, such as a chair or a stool. The word "yogya" means suitable or appropriate. The phrase "striyo ekada" means women, at some point in time. The word "nimantrayanti" means they invite. 

The sage should understand that these invitations are not simply offers of comfort, but rather traps set by women to ensnare men. The phrase "virup रूपान्" means various forms or appearances. 

The saying goes, "Just as a vine climbs the nearest tree, whether it be mango or neem, so too do women desire the nearest man." 

Therefore, a sage should avoid associating with women, as their allure can be difficult to resist. As the saying goes, "If you wish to catch something, first catch it with a hook. Once caught in the hook of desire, one will do both good and bad deeds." 

**Note:** The Jain terms "paasha" (trap) and "virup रूपान्" (various forms) are preserved in the translation.

**Śrī Sūtrakrtaṅga Sūtra, Chāyā:**

Do not cast your eyes upon them, nor should you even consider doing what they request. Even if you are in their company, do not wander about in this way. Thus, the soul remains protected.

**Anuvāda:**

As mentioned earlier, do not cast your eyes upon virtuous women. Do not dare to commit the evil deeds they request, and do not wander with them in villages or other places. By doing so, the soul of the virtuous remains protected and free from sin.

**Ṭīkā:**

"No" means "not at all." "Tāsu" refers to women who entice with offers of beds, seats, and other enticements. "Cakṣuḥ" means "eyes." "Sandadhyāt" means "to fix one's gaze." Do not fix your gaze upon them. If there is a need to look at them, do so with a slight disdain. As it is said:

"Even if engaged in a task, a wise man looks at a woman's body with a steady, unattached gaze, with disdain, even if he is not angry, he appears as if he is angry."

Similarly, do not even consider "sāhasa" - the act of doing what they request. This is a great act of audacity, for even a sage who has entered the battle of life and knows the consequences of hell, to engage with a woman is a great sin. Likewise, do not "viharet" - wander - with women in villages or other places. The word "api" indicates that you should not be alone with them. This is a great place of sin for ascetics, to be in the company of women. As it is said:

"Do not be alone with your mother, sister, or daughter. The senses are very powerful, even a wise man can be deceived by them."

By avoiding the company of women in this way, the soul is protected from all places of sin. For, the cause of all evils is association with women. Therefore, those who seek their own welfare should avoid their company from afar.

**How are these women like snares?**

**Ṭīkā-artha:**

Women entice virtuous men by offering them beds, seats, and other things. This request of theirs is a snare to trap the virtuous. Do not cast your eyes upon such women. Do not meet their gaze. If you must look at them, do so with a disdainful gaze. It is said that a wise man, when dealing with a woman, should look at her body with a detached, unattached gaze, even if he is not angry, he should appear as if he is angry. Do not agree to commit evil deeds with a woman at her request. For a sage who has entered the battle of life and knows the consequences of hell, to engage with a woman is a great act of audacity and impropriety. Do not wander with women in villages or other places. The use of the word "api" here indicates that you should not be alone with them. To be in the company of women, to be in their presence, is a great sin for ascetics. It is said that you should not be alone with your mother, sister, or daughter, for the senses are very powerful, even a wise man can be deceived by them. By avoiding the company of women in this way, the soul is protected from all places of sin. For, the cause of all evils is association with women. Therefore, those who seek their own welfare should avoid their company from afar.

**Āmantiya ussaviyā bhikṣaṁ āyasa nimantanti. Etāṇi ceva se jāṇe, sadāṇi virūvarūvāṇi.**

These are the things that you should know, they are always harmful.

Translation preserving Jain terms:

The women engage in the study of the Parijñādhyayana (knowledge of the world) - inviting and establishing the bhikkhu, they invite him with their own selves.
And he should know these as well, the words of diverse forms.

Translation - The lustful women give hints to the sadhu that "we will come to you at a certain place." They create trust in the sadhu through various kinds of talks. Then they invite the sadhu for enjoyment. The discerning sadhu should understand such words of the women as similar to diverse kinds of bondages.

Commentary - The women, by nature, are inclined towards the improper and invite the sadhu, giving a hint like "I will come to you at a certain time." Having thus established (the meeting), they create trust in the sadhu through various pleasant talks, and then invite him with their own selves for the purpose of enjoyment, making the sadhu agree to accept them. Or, the women themselves may have said, in order to dispel the fear of the sadhu, as if asking the husband, "I have come here," and having thus established (the meeting), they attend to him with actions like feeding, washing his feet, making him lie down on the bed, and then come to his presence, so that he, giving up all suspicion about your husband's people, may behave without fear. In this way, creating trust through various words, they invite the sadhu for their own enjoyment, tempting him by saying, "This body of mine is fit for whatever small or great task you may assign to it." But the sadhu, who is aware of the ultimate truth, should know these "words of diverse forms" as the objects created by the association with women, which are obstacles on the path of virtue, leading to a bad state, and through the knowledge of renunciation, he should avoid them by understanding their evil consequences.

And further,

With many mental bonds, embracing the gentle and disciplined,
Then they speak sweet words, commanding with diverse talks.

Page #296:
---------------------------
English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Sūtrakṛtāṅga Sūtra states that women are diligent in attracting the mind of the Sādhu (ascetic). They approach the Sādhu with compassionate words, humble demeanor, speak in a charming and sweet manner. Through amorous conversations and dialogues, they try to captivate the Sādhu.

Commentary - The things that bind the mind are called "manobandhana". These include speaking in a pleasant manner, affectionate glances, and revealing the limbs of the body, etc. As it is said, "O Lord, dear one, beloved, master, deity! You are more dear to me than my own life. I live because you live, you are the lord of my body."

With such numerous ploys, they approach the "upagasittāṇaṃ" (the one who has renounced) with compassionate speech and humility. Then, they speak "manjulāni" (charming, graceful, confidence-inspiring, and arousing desire) words. As it is said, "With her limited, sweet speech, playful glances and coy smiles, the doe-eyed one has covered my heart."

Further, through secret talks about various topics and words related to sexual union, they lead the Sādhu towards improper actions, either making him submit to their will or commanding him like a servant.

Just as a hunter, without fear, ensnares a lion with the lure of flesh, similarly, women bind the Sādhu, who is single-minded in his spiritual path.

Page #297:
---------------------------
Translation preserving Jain terms:

The commentary on the study of women, 'Sīha jaha' etc., is for the purpose of illustrating by example, just as those who know the method of binding, entice the fearless lion with flesh and other bait, and then bind it with a noose or other restraint, and torment it in various ways, similarly, women, through various means such as sweet speech, 'entice' a certain 'anagāra' (ascetic) who is even 'samvuta' (restrained) in mind, speech and body. And the mention of 'samvuta' is to indicate the power of women, for even a 'samvuta' ascetic is bound by them, what to speak of one who is 'asamvuta' (unrestrained).

Further, just as a chariot-maker gradually bends the felly of the wheel, similarly, they (women) bend and incline the ascetic towards their desired purpose. The deer-like ascetic, though struggling, does not get released from the snare, just as the ascetic caught in the trap of women cannot free himself despite efforts.

Thereafter, he (the ascetic) 'anutuappai', i.e., repents, and wants to 'bhocca pāyasam va visamissam', i.e., consume a mixture of milk-pudding. Thus, having taken up 'vivega' (detachment), 'samvāso navi kappae davie', i.e., living together (with women) is not appropriate for the second time.

**Śrī Sūtrakrtaṅga Sūtra, Chāyā -**  
Now, he repents after consuming poison mixed with milk. 
**Anuvāda -** Just as a man repents after consuming poison mixed with milk, so too does a man repent after being captivated by a woman. Understanding this, it is inconceivable for a sage who is on the path to liberation to live in the same place as a woman. 
**Tīkā -**  "Atha saḥ" etc.  This sage, bound by the snare of a woman, like a deer fallen into a trap, suffers day and night for the sake of his family and repents later.  Indeed, this is certainly possible for those who live in households, as follows: 
**Chāyā -** Who is angry? Who is equanimous? How can I subdue him? How can I give him wealth? Who is the generous one whom I have abandoned? Who is married? Who is a young man? Thus, the being, with trembling and anxiety, quickly binds himself with heavy sins. 
**Tathā tat -** "For the sake of my family, I have done terrible deeds. I am alone, suffering because of them. Those who enjoyed the fruits of my actions have gone." 
Thus, in many ways, those who have fallen into the trap of a family, full of great delusion, repent. The author explains this with an example, as follows: Just as someone, after consuming food mixed with poison, repents later, being overwhelmed by the effects of the poison, thinking, "Why did I, being a sinner, with my present taste for pleasure, taste such poisonous food?" Similarly, he, being overwhelmed with anxiety about the food, clothing, ornaments, and the death of his sons, grandsons, daughters, mothers-in-law, sisters, brothers-in-law, nephews, etc., and having lost his own bodily duties, and having lost his worldly practices, suffers day and night, his mind being disturbed by the affairs of his family. Thus, according to the above-mentioned principle, he obtains the result of his actions, "ādāya," or "viveka" as some read it.  He takes that result, or that understanding, "ādāya," and living together with women who are not virtuous, is certainly destructive of virtuous conduct, even under the name of understanding. 
**Tīkā-artha -** Just as a deer suffers in a trap, snare, or noose, so too does a sage, bound by the snare of a woman, suffer day and night for the sake of his family, for their sustenance, and repents later. Such things certainly happen to those who live in households. For example, who is angry? Who is equanimous? How can I subdue him? How can I give him wealth? Who is the generous one whom I have abandoned? Who is married? Who is a young man? Thus, the being, with trembling and anxiety, quickly binds himself with heavy sins. Then, repenting, he says, "I have done many terrible, wicked, and base deeds for the sake of my family, to support them. Because of those evil deeds, I am alone, suffering. Those who enjoyed the fruits of my actions have gone." Thus, in many ways, he repents, having fallen into the trap of a family, full of great delusion. The author explains this with an example: Just as someone, after consuming food mixed with poison, repents later, being overwhelmed by the effects of the poison, thinking, "Why did I, being a sinner, with my present taste for pleasure, taste such poisonous food?"

Thus, according to the above-mentioned principle, he obtains the result of his actions, "ādāya," or "viveka" as some read it.  He takes that result, or that understanding, "ādāya," and living together with women who are not virtuous, is certainly destructive of virtuous conduct, even under the name of understanding. 
**Concluding the discussion of the faults of association with women, he says:**

**Woman Studies**

Just as one should not eat food that will cause suffering in the end, similarly, a man bound by the ties of a woman also suffers due to the needs of his son, grandson, daughter, son-in-law, sister, nephew, niece, etc. He is burdened with the worries of food, marriage, ornaments, caste ceremonies, birth celebrations, death rituals, and the treatment of family members who are ill. He forgets what he should do for his own body and is unable to care for it. He is devoid of both worldly and otherworldly good deeds and is always preoccupied and anxious about the upbringing of his family, leading to regret.

Considering the above-mentioned consequences, according to the term "viveka" in the text, living in the same place as women who hinder virtue is destructive to the virtuous conduct of wise men, as it undermines their noble and virtuous actions.

The guide, after pointing out the potential flaws associated with women, concludes by saying:

**Verse 11:**

* **Original:** तम्हा उ वज्जए इत्थी, विसलित्तं व कंटगं नच्चा । ओए कुलाणि वसवत्ती, आघाते ण सेवि णिग्गंथे ॥११॥
* **Transliteration:** Tamhā u vajjae itthī, visalittṁ va kaṇṭaṁ nacca. Oe kulāṇi vasavattī, āghāte ṇ sevi nigganthē. ||11||
* **Translation:** Therefore, one should avoid women, knowing them to be like thorns smeared with poison. He who is subservient to women and goes alone to the homes of householders, is not truly a liberated one (niggantha).

**Commentary:**

Since contact with women leads to bitter consequences, one should avoid them. This includes even talking to them. The verse explains why: "Knowing" them to be like thorns smeared with poison, one should avoid women. Just as a thorn smeared with poison can cause harm if it pierces the body, so too can contact with women cause harm. This is further emphasized by the saying:

* **Original:** "विषस्य विषयाणां च दूरमत्यन्तमन्तरम् । उपभुक्तं विषं हन्ति, विषयाः स्मरणादपि ॥ १ ॥ "
* **Transliteration:** "Visasya viṣayāṇāṁ ca dūramatyantāntaram. Upabhuktaṁ viṣaṁ hanti, viṣayāḥ smaraṇādapi. || 1 ||"
* **Translation:** "There is a great distance between poison and objects of desire. Poison kills when consumed, but objects of desire kill even by mere remembrance."

Similarly, another saying states:

* **Original:** "वरंविषं जग्धं न विषयसुखं एकशो विषेण म्रियते । विषयामिषघातिताः पुनर्नरा नरकेषुपतन्ति ॥ १ ॥”
* **Transliteration:** "Varaṁviṣaṁ jagdhaṁ na viṣayasukhaṁ ekaśo viṣeṇa mriyate. Viṣayāmiṣaghātitāḥ punar narā narakeṣupatantaḥ. || 1 ||"
* **Translation:** "It is better to consume poison than to indulge in the pleasures of the senses. One who dies by poison dies alone, but those who are killed by the pleasures of the senses fall into hell."

The verse also states that one who is subservient to women and goes alone to the homes of householders, is not truly a liberated one (niggantha). This is because he is under their control and is likely to be influenced by them. He may even be tempted to engage in forbidden activities, which would lead to harm.

If a woman is unable to come due to some reason, or if she is old, then one should go alone to her house, but only if there are no other male companions. One should preach the Dharma in a way that generates detachment, focusing on the evils of women and the disgust they inspire. This will help to avoid any potential harm.

The meaning of the verse is clear from the context and the explanations provided.

Page #300:
---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra
**Commentary:** Contact with women, association, results in bitter and harsh fruits in the outcome. Therefore, one should abandon association. Here, the word 'tu' used in this verse indicates that one should not engage in conversation or dialogue with women. How? It is explained by saying that women should be considered like thorns smeared with poison and abandoned. A thorn smeared with poison, if it breaks into any part of the body, causes harm and suffering, but women cause harm simply by being remembered. Therefore, it is said that there is so much difference between poison and the object of desire, poison destroys life when eaten, but the object of desire takes life just by remembering it. It is better to eat poison, but it is not good to consume the object of desire, because by eating poison, a being suffers the pain of death only once, but by consuming the object of desire, a human being falls into hell again and again and suffers torment. A man who is subservient to a woman and goes to her house alone to please her and narrates religious stories according to her wishes, is not a true renunciant or a true saint, because by consuming the actions that have been forbidden, his fall is possible. If a woman is unable to come to the saint's place for some reason, or if she is old, then in the absence of other supporting saints, the saint can go to her alone and preach the religion that generates detachment, which mainly includes criticism of women and worldly pleasures, there is no objection in doing so.

**Anvaya:** The meaning explained by this method, where the presence of one thing leads to the presence of another, and the absence of one thing leads to the absence of another (Yat Satve Yat Satvam - Anvaya, Yat Asatve, Yat Asatvam - Vyatireka), becomes easy to understand. With this intention, the Sutrakar says:

**Eyam Uncham Anugiddha, Annayarah Hunti Kusilanaam. Suttavassyevi Se Bhikkhu, No Vihare Sah Namitthisu. || 12 ||**

**Shadow:**

**Ye Etad Ancchamanuguddha Anyataraste Bhavanti Kusilanaam. Supatvasvapi Sa Bhikkhu Na Viharet Sardham Striibhih. ||**

**Translation:** Those men who are engaged in reprehensible actions like association with women are Kusilas - devoid of good conduct. Therefore, even if a saint is an excellent ascetic, he should not engage in association or interaction with women.

**Commentary:** 'Je Eyam Uncham' etc., 'Ye' those who are of dull intellect, who have performed the duties of the past, who are present-day observers, they 'Unchanti' despise, the object of disgust is to be seen here as the association with women, or the narration of religious stories to a single woman, those who are 'Giddha' attached to that, who are unconscious, they are 'Kusilanaam' those who are close to the Kusilas, who are attached to the Kusilas, or they are 'Anyatara' those who are like the Kusilas, who are spreaders of gossip, who are like the Kusilas, those who are in the middle of them are also Kusilas, that is the meaning. Therefore, 'Sutpakvyaapi' even if the saint is of excellent penance, who has burnt his body with penance, 'Saadhu' the saint, desiring his own welfare, should not 'Viharet' associate with 'Striibhih' those who are obstacles to meditation, even for a moment, he should not stay there. The seventh case in the third meaning, 'Namiti' in the figure of speech, the meaning is that the saint should avoid women like a burning fire. || 12 ||

**Question:** Which women should not be associated with?

**Answer:**

Page #301:
---------------------------
## Study of Women

A man who is dull-witted, devoid of intelligence, and abandons righteous conduct and righteous behavior, fixated on present pleasures, engages in acts like associating with women, as described earlier, and goes to the home of a solitary householder to preach Dharma to a woman, and engages in other such reprehensible acts, is one of the following types of *kushila*: *pārśvastha*, *avasanna*, *kuśīla*, *sasanka*, or *yatha chanda rūpa kuśīla*. Alternatively, he is one of the following types of *kushila*: *kāyika*, *pasyaka samprasāraka*, or *māmaka saṁjñaka*. Or, he is *kushila* due to being in their midst, and by engaging in reprehensible acts like associating with women, he becomes a *sadhu kuśīla*. 

A *sadhu* who has subjected his body to intense austerities, even if he desires his own welfare and spiritual liberation, should not go or stay anywhere with women who are obstacles to or destroyers of *samādhi*, *charitra*, and *dharma*. Here, the seventh case ending is used in the sense of the third case ending. The word 'ṇ' indicates a figure of speech in the sentence. The meaning of this verse is that a *sadhu* should abandon a woman as he would abandon a pile of burning embers from afar.

To address the concern of which women should not be associated with, the author of the sutras says:

**Om Om Om**

**Avi dhayarahi suṇhāhiṁ, dhātihiṁ aduv dāsihiṁ. Mahātihi vā kumārihiṁ, santhavam se na kujjā aṇagāre.** || 13 ||

**Chāyā**

**-**

**-**

**Anuvāda**

Even if she is his daughter, daughter-in-law, *dhātrī* (wet nurse), *dāsī* (maid), elder woman, or young girl, a *sadhu* should not engage in *sanstava* (association) with her.

**Api duhitṛbhiḥ snūṣābhiḥ dhātrībhiḥ rathavā dāsībhiḥ. Mahātibhirvā kumārihiḥ sanstavam sa na kuryyādanagāraḥ.** || 13 ||

**Tīkā**

The word 'api' is connected to each word. The *sadhu* should not associate with his daughter, nor should he sit alone with his daughter-in-law. There are five types of *dhātrī*: those who breastfeed, those who suckle, those who serve and care for the child, and those who are like mothers. A *sadhu* should not stay alone with any of them. What to say of other women? Even with those who are of low caste, who fetch water, a *sadhu* should not associate with them. Whether she is an elder woman or a young girl, according to the word 'vā' used here, even if she is a *sādhvī* (female ascetic), a *sadhu* should not engage in *sanstava* (association) with her. Even if a *sadhu* does not experience a change in his mind while sitting alone with his daughter or daughter-in-law, there is still a suspicion that others might think ill of him. Therefore, to dispel this suspicion, association with women should be avoided. || 13 ||

To show how such suspicion arises, the author says...

Page #302:
---------------------------
English translation preserving Jain terms:

Seeing the Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra, doubt may arise, therefore, to dispel that doubt, one should renounce the contact with a woman.

The Shastrakara (author) explains that when a Sadhu (ascetic) is seen with a woman, it creates doubt in the minds of others. 

"Adunainom cha suhinom va, appiyam daddu ekata hoti. Giddha satta kamehi, rakkhanaposaname manusso'si" (14) - Meaning: Seeing the pure or the knowledgeable ones, sometimes it becomes unpleasant. The greedy beings, attached to sensual pleasures, (think) "You are the protector and nourisher (of this woman)."

Commentary: When a solitary woman is seen with a Nirgrantha (ascetic), it causes great distress in the minds of her family members and relatives. They think that just as other common people are engrossed in sensual pleasures, similarly this ascetic is also greedy and infatuated with desire. Then they say to him - "You are the man of this (woman), you are associated with her, then why don't you take care and nourish her?"

Page #303:

- Even if a monk is seen to be indifferent, some people get angry.
They suspect the woman of being immoral because she provides him with food.

Page #304:
---------------------------
The woman, having cooked food with her own hands, served it to her father-in-law and husband. Her father-in-law understood the whole situation. Her husband, enraged, beat her and, suspecting her of being attracted to another man, drove her out of the house.

"Those who are corrupted from samadhi and yoga, they increase their association with women. Therefore, the Shramanas do not associate with them, considering it beneficial for their own self." (16)

Commentary: "Kuvanti" etc., "Taabhi:" - by women - those who are obstacles to the right path, they increase their association with them, which is in the form of going to their houses, talking to them, accepting donations from them, looking at them, and getting acquainted with them. And due to the arising of delusion, they "kuvanti" - they create, what kind of? - greatly corrupted, fallen from "samadhiyoga" - samadhi is the meditation on Dharma, and the yogas - mental, verbal, and bodily activities - are for that purpose, they are those who have fallen from them, those who are cool-natured. Because association with women leads to the destruction of samadhi and yoga, therefore, for that reason, "Shramanas" - the true virtuous ones - "na samenti" - do not go. As if they are falling into a trap, due to their beauty and the production of happiness, they are called "nishadya" - the dwelling place of women is called "nishadya", considering it beneficial for their own self, the virtuous ones do not go there. And this avoidance of association with women is beneficial for them, as it protects them from worldly and otherworldly harm. In some places, this is read as "Tamha Shramanah u jahahi ahitao sannisejjiao" - the meaning of this is - because association with women is harmful, therefore, O Shramanas! virtuous ones! - "tu" is for emphasis, especially "sannisejjya" - the dwelling place of women, or the service and attention shown by them, is to be abandoned for the sake of self-benefit.

Commentary meaning: Women are obstacles to the right path - Dharma. They are like the fire that catches on to the doors. Going to their houses, talking to them, accepting donations from them, looking at them, and getting acquainted with them, all this happens due to the arising of delusion about them. What kind of people are those who increase their association with women? In response to this, it is said that they are corrupted from samadhi and Dharma yoga, and from the mental, verbal, and bodily activities that are based on samadhi. They are lax in their conduct. Association with women destroys samadhi and yoga. Therefore, the virtuous ones of the highest order do not fall into the trap of women's deception. That which is conducive to happiness, due to its ability to produce happiness, is called "nishadya" - the dwelling place of women is called "nishadya". The virtuous ones who desire self-welfare do not go there. The advice given to abandon association with women is beneficial for the self, as it protects women from worldly and otherworldly harm. In the latter part of this verse, there is a variant reading "Tamha Shramanah u jahahi ahitao sannisejjiao" - the meaning of this is - association with women is harmful, therefore, O Shramanas! virtuous ones! - "tu" is for emphasis, especially "sannisejjya" - the dwelling place of women, or the service and attention shown by them, is to be abandoned for the sake of self-benefit.

Can someone who has accepted the vows of a Shraman, still associate with women? To this, it is said, yes, they can.

Many people, even after taking initiation, partially follow the conduct of a householder and partially that of a monk. They proclaim this mixed conduct as the path to liberation. The words of those who are deceitful and have a wicked character are full of strength, not their actions.

Page #306:
---------------------------
The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra. Commentary - That deceitful person, by mere words, reveals his lack of strength. He is established in the 'Parsadi' (assembly) and at the time of Dharma-deshana (religious discourse), he declares himself to be 'Shuddha' (pure), free from faults, and his own conduct. But in secret, he 'Karot' (does) evil, sin, or the cause of sin, which is improper conduct. Even though he tries to hide his improper conduct, people 'Jananti' (know) it. Who knows? - Those who know such conduct, i.e., those who are skilled in understanding gestures and expressions, know it. Or, it may be said that the omniscient ones know it. Even if someone else does not know their duty, the omniscient ones know it. Is that knowledge not enough? Or, those who know the nature of things, know that he is a magician, a great deceiver, and blinded by attachment. He thinks that no one knows him, but those who know, know him. As it is said:

"Na ya lonam lonijjai na ya tuppijjai ghayam va tellam va. Kiha sakko vancheum atta anuhuy kallano ||1||" ||18||

Commentary - That deceitful person, by mere words, reveals his lack of strength. He is established in the 'Parsadi' (assembly) and at the time of Dharma-deshana (religious discourse), he declares himself to be 'Shuddha' (pure), free from faults, and his own conduct. But in secret, he 'Karot' (does) evil, sin, or the cause of sin, which is improper conduct. Even though he tries to hide his improper conduct, people 'Jananti' (know) it.

Or, those who know the nature of things, know that he is a magician, a great deceiver, and blinded by attachment. He thinks that no one knows him, but those who know, know him. As it is said:

"Salt cannot be hidden, nor can ghee or oil. How can a soul, who has experienced good, be deceived?"

And further:

"He does not speak of his own evil deeds, and when asked, he praises himself like a child. Do not ask him about the Vedas, for when questioned, he becomes dejected."

Commentary - He does not 'Vadati' (speak) of the evil he has done, which is hidden in his own nature, even when asked by his teacher or someone else. He does not say, "I am the doer of this evil." He is a deceitful person with hidden sins, and when he is 'Adishta' (instructed) by someone else, he praises himself.

Page #307:
---------------------------
The study of women is called 'Bala'. An ignorant person, influenced by attachment and aversion, claims that he is being falsely accused of wrongdoing. He speaks with arrogance, saying, "How could I possibly do such a wrong thing?" Similarly, the Veda - the Veda of men - indicates that his 'Anuveechi', his desire for sexual pleasure, is not conducive to his well-being. When he is repeatedly advised against it, he becomes 'Glayati' - he experiences dejection. He ignores the advice, or he speaks with pain, as if pierced by a sharp object. As it is said:

**Commentary:**

"Even if I am suspected of sin, what harm is there in me being sinless? Even a non-poisonous snake is greatly feared by people."

Furthermore, a man of bad character, especially, does not reveal the sin he has secretly committed when questioned by an Acharya or others. He claims that he has not done any such wrong deed. He is a hidden sinner - a deceitful person who secretly commits sins. He himself does not confess, and when someone else tries to make him confess, he, being ignorant and filled with attachment and aversion, praises himself and says that the accusation of wrongdoing against him is false. He speaks with great arrogance and audacity, saying, "How could I possibly do such a wrong thing?" Here, the word 'Veda' refers to the Veda of men. His desire for sexual pleasure, in accordance with his nature, is called 'Anuveechi'. Therefore, when a Guru or others tell him not to indulge in illicit sexual activity, this man of bad character becomes dejected, or he ignores it, or it deeply affects him, piercing his heart. He becomes distressed and says, "If I am suspected of sin, what harm is there in me being sinless? Even a non-poisonous snake is greatly feared by people."

**Translation:**

Men who have indulged in the nurturing of women, who have experienced it all, and who know that women are very deceitful, those who are wise, do not fall under the sway of women.

**Commentary:**

The phrase 'Ushita Api' means 'even though they have been established' in the practice of nurturing women. 'Purusha' refers to men who have experienced and enjoyed it all. Similarly, 'Streevedakhedagnaah' means 'those who know that the Veda of women is primarily based on deceit'. Even those who are skilled and wise, those who are endowed with knowledge of birth, etc., those who are 'Eke' - great fools blinded by delusion - fall under the sway of 'Narinam' - women, who are the paths to worldly existence. They are 'Kasanit' - drawn to them by their proximity and dependence. Even though they are aware of their nature, they still act according to their desires, whether right or wrong. They do not understand that these women are of such a nature. As it is said:

-

"These women laugh and cry, they assure men of their intentions, but they do not keep their promises. Therefore, a man of good character should avoid them like a cremation ground."

Similarly,

##  The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

"Like the waves of the ocean, their nature is fickle, like the red hues of the evening clouds, their passions are fleeting. Women, having achieved their purpose, deem men useless, and discard them like a used piece of lac." (2)

Here, a story is presented to understand the nature of women. A young man, leaving his home, set out for Pataliputra to study the Vaisheshika Kamashastra, a treatise on the nature of women. On the way, he encountered a woman in a village. She said, "Your hands and feet are delicate, your form is beautiful, where are you going?" He told her the truth. She said, "After studying the Vaisheshika, come back this way." He agreed. After studying, he returned, and she treated him well with baths, meals, and various gestures and glances, captivating his heart. He became enamored with her. When he tried to take her hand, she cried out loudly. When people gathered, she threw a water pot on his head, saying, "Just as he is not dead from the water that touched his neck, so I am not wet by this water." When the crowd dispersed, she asked him, "Have you learned about the nature of women from your study of the Vaisheshika Shastra?" Thus, the character of women is difficult to understand, and there is no reliance to be placed on them. As it is said,

"One thing is spoken, another is done, one thing is in front, another behind. One thing is yours, another is mine, everything about women is something else." (1)

Now, to show the consequences of association with women, it is said:

...

The actions performed to nourish a woman are called "Stri Posha" or "Poshaka." Those who are involved in such actions have come to know their faults. Those who know the nature of women, the "Stri Vega" - the nature of women, know that women are inherently full of Maya (illusion). Their nature is deceitful. Those who are skilled in knowing this, who are "Utpadak" - those who have a mind that is born from the "Utpad" (creation), and others, are blinded by great delusion. They become slaves to women, who are the path of coming and going in the world. They do not know what is right or wrong, and do whatever women tell them to do. Women laugh to get their work done, they give assurances, but they never trust themselves. Therefore, men of high lineage and good character should avoid women like a deserted marketplace. It is said, "Like the waves of the ocean, their nature is fickle, like the red hues of the evening clouds, their passions are fleeting. Women, having achieved their purpose, deem men useless, and discard them like a used piece of lac." (2)

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The woman began the Parijñādhyayana (study of the nature of women). After a large crowd had gathered, she said that water had entered her throat. An opposite water consumption-related disease had developed. She was on the verge of death. Seeing this, I made her bathe in water and poured a pot of water over her.

When the assembled crowd dispersed, she began to question the young man, asking what knowledge of the nature of women he had gained from the study of Kāmaśāstra. She said that truly understanding a woman's character is very difficult. Therefore, a man should never trust a woman's nature. It is said that women have something else in their hearts, something else behind, something else on their tongue, something else in front, and something else behind.

What is something for you may be something else entirely for me, meaning a woman's mindset is not the same towards different men. In reality, everything about women is different or else.

The verse states: "Even for the sake of cutting off the hands and feet, or for the sake of cutting the growing flesh, or for scorching them with fire, or for pouring saline solutions on them - the women become enraged."

The commentary explains that men who indulge in relationships with other women have their hands and feet cut off. Their skin and flesh are also torn off. They are tormented by fire, and saline solutions are poured on their wounds by the enraged family members of the woman.

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra - Translation - The sin-afflicted person who is tormented by sins endures the cutting off of their ears, nose, and throat, i.e., their ears, nose, and throat are cut off. But they do not resolve in their mind that they will not commit such sinful acts in the future.

Commentary - They "endure" (titikshante) the cutting off of the ears, nose, and throat due to their own faults, i.e., they suffer such diverse torments. In this very human birth, they experience sufferings beyond hell due to their sinful actions, but they do not resolve that "I will not perform such an act again." Thus, they accept the worldly and other-worldly suffering and torment, but do not desist from committing sinful and evil deeds.

Moreover, "It is heard (shrutam) that the nature of women is very bad," as it is said. Even after saying this, they (women) either do not do or do the opposite of what is said.

Commentary - "It is heard" (shrutam) means what has been obtained from the teacher or from the people, that is, what has been previously described, such as: the mind of women is difficult to understand, the result of association with women is dreadful, women are of an unstable nature, difficult to manage, short-sighted, naturally light, and self-conceited. This is how "the nature of women is known" (strivedo) through the traditional stories or the scriptures that reveal the true nature and the consequences of association with women.

As it is said, "The heart of women is as difficult to grasp as their speech, and their nature is as uneven as the path of a mountain. The mind of women does not stay in one place, like the water on a lotus leaf, and they are nourished by various vices, like creepers by poisonous substances." Moreover, "They are well-conquered, well-loved, well-conquered, well-loved, well-conquered, and well-obtained. But in the case of women who are difficult, there should be no trust."

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Study of the Nature of Women
That man who sees the entire world of living beings as equal, even though he desires a woman, does not attain sorrow. ॥2॥
He raises his finger, that man, in the entire world of living beings. Though desiring the form of a woman, he does not do anything more than her shadow with desires.

Verily, these (women) create discontentment in everyone. But they do not do anything more than what is sufficient for him who is content with (their) desires. ॥3॥
Further, even after saying "I will not do the improper," they still "do the opposite" by their actions. Or, even if they accept (the instructions) in front (of the teacher), they still do the opposite of the teacher's teachings. ॥23॥
The author himself explains the nature of that (behavior).

Explanation - What was said earlier, we have heard from the elders and also from the people. Comprehending the mind of women is very difficult. The fruit of having contact with them is also very dreadful and painful. The nature of women is fickle. Serving them is very difficult. Women are not far-sighted. Their nature is extremely vile and low, they are very arrogant. Many say so. This is also heard from the traditional lore. It also appears so from the old stories. The nature of women and the fruit of their association is called the "Impetuosity of Women" in the science of Kama (erotics). This science describes the nature of women. It is stated in this science that the reflection seen on a mirror is distant and cannot be grasped. Similarly, the heart of women cannot be grasped or understood. The intention of women is as deep as the difficult path of a mountain, hence cannot be known. Their mind is as fluid and unstable as a drop of water on a lotus leaf. Therefore, it does not stay in one place. Just as a poisonous creeper grows from a poisonous seed, similarly, women are born with defects. One should not trust a woman who is completely conquered, self-reliant, extremely pleased, very clean, or extremely familiar with the forest. In this whole world, what man can raise his finger and say that he has not suffered torment by desiring a woman. The tendency of women is that they do not only despise the man they desire, but they also despise and insult all others. Women, even after giving assurance in words that they will not do such acts in the future, act contrary to their words, or they accept the words of the teacher in front of him, but later on, they harm him.

The mind thinks of one thing, the speech says another, and the action does something else. Therefore, the monk should not have faith in women, knowing them to be highly deceitful. ॥24॥

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Jain monk should not have faith in women, for they are full of deception. Just as Dattavaisika was not deceived by the tricks of a courtesan, in the same way, others should also not have faith in women.

A young woman, adorned with various ornaments and clothes, may say to the Jain monk, "I have renounced the household life and will follow the path of asceticism. Please teach me the Dharma, O protector from the fear of the cycle of birth and death." However, the monk should understand that this is merely a ploy, as the woman is still attached to worldly pleasures. Therefore, the monk should not be misled by such deception.

"I will study the knowledge of women. I will practice the restraint called 'ruksha' or perhaps the restraint called 'maun'. There is a saying that the muni's 'maun' is a restraint. I will practice that restraint. O you who protect us from fear, teach me the Dharma, so that I may not become a vessel of suffering."

"And what else?"

Commentary: A young woman, adorned with various clothes and ornaments, may deceitfully tell a sadhu that she has renounced worldly life, that her husband is not agreeable to her, that he does not follow her wishes, or that she does not like him, or that he has abandoned her. Therefore, she will practice restraint. Sometimes, 'maun' is found in the scriptures. The muni's feeling is called 'maun', and its meaning is restraint. That woman says, "I will practice the Dharma of 'maun-samyama'. Therefore, O sadhu, you who deliver us from the fear of worldly transmigration, teach me the Dharma, give me the teachings of Dharma, so that I may not become a vessel of worldly suffering."

"A woman, pretending to be a 'shravaka', comes near a sadhu, saying, 'I am a 'sadharmini' of the 'shramanas'. Just as a water pot made of lac melts near a fire, so too, a wise man, a knowledgeable sadhu, becomes dejected in the company of a woman."

Commentary: Or, by the word 'pravade', it is meant that a woman, pretending to be a 'sadhvi', approaches a sadhu. By saying, "I am a 'shravaka' and a 'sadharmini' of your 'shramanas'," she comes close to him, and like a heap of sand, she corrupts the sadhu from Dharma. This is what is said: The proximity of a woman is a great harm to a 'brahmacharin'. And it is also said:

"Knowledge, that knowledge, that austerity, and that restraint, all are destroyed in a moment, all are destroyed by a woman."

In this very meaning, the sutrakara gives an example: Just as a pot made of lac, placed near a fire, melts, so too, a wise man, who knows what is to be known, becomes dejected in the company of women, and becomes lax in the practice of Dharma. What to speak of others?

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Sutra of Sutrakritanga. In a lac vessel, hidden in light, when heated, it perishes.
Similarly, the Anagara (ascetics) perish by association with women. ||27||

Explanation - Just as a lac vessel, hidden in light (fire), when heated on all sides, quickly melts and perishes, in the same way, the Anagara (ascetic) attains destruction by association (Samvasa) with women, completely abandoning the austerity of vows, and falling from the body of self-control.

Commentary - Just as the lac vessel, covered by 'Jyotisha' (fire), when heated by the fire, facing it, is quickly 'Nashama upayati' (perishes), melting away, in the same way, the Anagaras, by 'Samvasena' (association, enjoyment) with women, attain destruction, completely abandoning the hardship of vows, falling from the body of self-control.

Some say, when asked, that they do not commit sins, "This woman is sleeping in my lap," i.e., she has been sleeping in my lap since childhood. ||28||

Commentary - Those who are attached to the cycle of rebirth, indulge in 'Papakarmana' (sinful acts) such as sexual indulgence, when questioned by the preceptor, etc., some deluded ones say this, as if - "I, born in such a noble family, will not do such a sinful, wrong act. This (woman) has been sleeping in my lap like a daughter, she is acting thus due to her previous habit, not that I, knowing the nature of the cycle of rebirth, will give up the observance of vows even at the cost of life."

Page #315:
---------------------------
Jain Terms Preserved:

The woman was sleeping in the lap. Therefore, due to her previous practice, she behaves this way with me. I know the nature of the world-substance, even if the living beings are destroyed, I will not break the vow.

The second foolishness of the ignorant child is that he commits sin but does not acknowledge it. In this way, he commits double the sin. He desires fame and reputation in the world, thus he wishes for indiscipline - he wants to move forward in the direction of indiscipline.

Commentary: The one who is afflicted by attachment and aversion, who is ignorant and does not see the ultimate truth or liberation, his second foolishness is that on one hand, he commits the wrong act of breaking the fourth vow of celibacy, and on the other hand, he denies having done so, he speaks falsehood. The author explains that by such unrighteous conduct and denial, he commits double the sin. Why does he deny? It is because he desires honor, respect, and reputation in the world, he wants to hide his sinful act, thus he wishes for indiscipline, he wants to move towards the path of indiscipline.

"They said to the ascetic who is worthy of being looked at, who has attained self-knowledge: 'O protector from the ocean of the world! Please accept from us the clothes, the bowl, the food, and the drink.'"

Page #316:
---------------------------
The **Śrī Sūtra Kṛtāṅga Sūtra** commentary, a collection of verses, describes a beautiful and virtuous **anagāra** (a monk who has renounced worldly life), who is self-aware and has attained self-knowledge. Some **śvairīṇī** (women who are free and unrestrained) invite him, saying, "O **Trāyin** (protector)! We will give you all that you need, such as clothes, vessels, and drinks. Please come to our house and accept them." ||30||

The commentary explains that the **śvairīṇī** women invite the **anagāra** with the intention of tempting him. The **anagāra** should understand this invitation as a trap, like rice grains scattered to lure a pig. He should not desire to go to their house, for he is bound by the **viṣaya** (objects of sense) and will fall into **moha** (delusion). ||31||

The commentary further explains that the **anagāra** should not desire to return to the **agāra** (household life), as he is bound by the **viṣaya** (objects of sense) and will fall into **moha** (delusion). The **viṣaya** are like ropes that bind the ignorant soul, making him unable to break free from the bonds of attachment. He becomes confused and bewildered, unable to discern right from wrong. ||31||

This concludes the first section of the **Śrī Sūtra Kṛtāṅga Sūtra** commentary on the knowledge of women. ||4-1||

## The Study of Women: Second Objective

The first objective has been discussed. Now, the second objective is being commenced. Its connection is as follows: In the previous objective, the downfall of character due to praise, acquaintance, and contact with women was discussed. The state of a man who has fallen from virtue, the karmic bondage he incurs, and its description in this world are being discussed in this objective. With this connection, the initial sutra of this objective is:

**"Oja should never be attached, but the lustful should detach. Hear about the enjoyment of the Shramanas, just as some Bhikkhus enjoy."** (1)

**Commentary:** Ojas, the virtuous and powerful soul, should never be attached to sensual desires. If, by fate, it happens, then one should detach oneself with the help of knowledge. Enjoyment is inappropriate for the virtuous, yet there are some virtuous who indulge in it. This is what you should hear.

**Explanation:** This sutra is connected to the preceding and succeeding sutras. The connection is this: The worldly bond of sensual desires leads to delusion. Therefore, Ojas, free from attachment and aversion, should not develop attachment towards women. The connection with the preceding sutra is that if a woman, seeing a renunciate who has renounced the world, tries to deceive him with food and other things, then Ojas, being present, should not be attached. Ojas, in essence, is an atom, but in terms of its nature, it is free from attachment and aversion. Attachment to women, as will be discussed later, leads to various kinds of deception, which results in karmic bondage. Due to the ripening of this karma, there is intense suffering in hell and other realms. Therefore, knowing this, Ojas, being present, should never be attached to women, who are like mines of evil, at all times. Even if, due to the rise of delusion, one becomes desirous of enjoyment, one should still detach oneself from them, considering the dangers of this life and the next. This is what is being said: Even if the mind is driven by the ripening of karma, one should turn it away with the lasso of knowledge by considering the harmful consequences. Similarly, you should hear that even the Shramanas, who are exhausted by austerities, also indulge in enjoyment. This is what is being said: Just as householders indulge in enjoyment, so too do the Yatis, but their enjoyment is deceptive. What are the states that result from this? It has been said: "Shaved head," etc., as before. Just as some "Bhikkhus," who are not firmly established in Dharma, indulge in deceptive enjoyment, so too will the greatness of this be shown in detail in the future, as will be discussed in the sutra of this objective. It has also been said by others:

**"Lean, one-eyed, lame, deaf, with a broken tail, hungry, old, with a throat choked by a piece of broken pot, with a body covered in wounds, pus, and hundreds of worms, even a dead dog is pursued by lust."** (1)

This, etc., is said to show the deception of those who indulge in enjoyment.

**Commentary:** This sutra is connected to the preceding and succeeding sutras. The connection is this: The worldly bond of sensual desires leads to delusion. Therefore, Ojas, free from attachment and aversion, should not develop attachment towards women, not be attached.

Page #318:
---------------------------
This is the connection of this Sutra with the Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra - If a woman wants to deceive a monk who appears to be a monk by giving him food, etc., like grains of rice scattered to lure an animal, then the monk should not be attached to it, rising above attachment and aversion. There are two types of strength - material strength and mental strength. Material strength is in the form of atoms, and mental strength is in the form of a man free from attachment and aversion. Being attached to women in this life causes various kinds of suffering, which will be described later. From that attachment, karma-bondage arises, and due to the result of karma-bondage, one has to suffer severe torments in hell, etc., in the form of the fruition of karma. Therefore, a monk should understand this and become endowed with mental strength, free from attachment and aversion, and should never be attached to women, who are a mine of misfortune and sorrow. If, due to delusion, a monk develops a desire for enjoyment, then he should consider the worldly and otherworldly sufferings arising from contact with women and abstain from them, stay away from them. The meaning is that if the mind becomes attached to women as a result of the rise of karma, then the monk should contemplate the nature of the objects that are to be rejected and the objects that are to be accepted, and remove it from there with the whip of knowledge. One who is weary and distressed due to austerity is called a Shraman. Even Shramans of this category fall into enjoyments. Listen to this. The meaning is that enjoyment is full of irony even for householders, what to say of Sannyasins or monks? For them, enjoyment is extremely ironic. What to say about the state of enjoying enjoyment? This has already been described by the words "Mundam Shirah", etc. Enjoyment is ironic, but still, the way weak-willed monks enjoy them will be shown in detail by the Sutras of this topic. It is said - A dog that is thin in body, whose one eye is gouged out, whose leg is lame, whose ear is cut, whose tail is also cut, who is emaciated from hunger, who is old, who is suffering from the burning of the iron in his neck, who is oozing pus from wounds, who has hundreds of worms wriggling on him, who runs after bitches, Kamadeva seems to kill even the dead.
While showing the irony of those who are attached to enjoyment, it is said...
Atha tam tu bhedam apannam, muchchhitam bhikkham kamam ativarld. Pali bindya nam to paccha, paduddhatu muddhi pahaanti ||2||
Chhaya - Atha tantu bhadam apannam, muchchhitam bhikkham kamam ativartam.
Paribhidya tat pacchat padavudhyaty mudhni praghnanti ||
Anuvaad - Knowing that the monk, having fallen from restraint, is attached to a fallen woman, and is unconscious in the enjoyment of lust, the woman strikes his head with her foot - kicks him on the head.
Tika - 'Athe' is the word for subsequent meaning, 'tu' is the word for qualification, after the contact with the woman, 'bhikkhu' monk, 'bhedam' breach of conduct, fall from virtue, 'apannam' attained, being, in women, 'muchchhit' intoxicated, engrossed, the same is explained - in 'kameshu' desires, lust, in the opinion - of the mind - of the mind, 'varto' - 'vartana' activity, whose this is 'kamam ativarta' lustful, meaning, the same such 'paribhidya' having been overtaken by intoxication, knowing that 'shvetakrishnaprapatta' white and black, 'madvashakayi' under my control, thus, if - 'paribhidya' - 'parisaryaatmakritam' done by oneself, and 'tatkritam' done by others, 'uchcharyeti' should be said, for example, 'maya' by me, 'luchchit' your head, 'jallamal' pus, 'vilataya' by oozing, 'durgandhasya' of foul smell, 'jugupsaniya' disgusting, 'kkshaavakshobast' chest, 'stisthanasya' of the place, 'kulasheela' family conduct, 'maryada' limit

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The woman, after abandoning her modesty, dharma, and other virtues, says to the ascetic who is engrossed in sensual pleasures: "You are now reduced to a person of no consequence." Seeing this, the ascetic, who is infatuated with her, falls at her feet to appease her. It is said:

"The lions with their thick, large manes, the elephants with their temples oozing ichor, and the heroic men in battle become the most cowardly in the presence of women."[1]

Thereafter, realizing that the ascetic is completely infatuated with the objects of senses, she raises her left foot and strikes it on his head, thus humiliating him.[2]

Further, the woman says to the ascetic:

"O Bhikkhu! If you are hesitant to stay with a woman having thick hair, then I shall pluck out my hair here itself. Thereafter, you shall not stay anywhere else but with me."[3]

Explanation: The woman, using clever and friendly words, tries to make the ascetic understand that if he is ashamed to stay with a woman having thick hair, then she is willing to pluck out her hair. However, after that, he shall not stay anywhere else but with her.

Page #320:
---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra with Commentary - English Translation

**Commentary:**  A woman with hair is called a "keshika". In this verse, the word "ṇam" is used in the sense of a figure of speech. The woman says, "O Muni! If you cannot go on a journey with me, meaning, if you are ashamed to enjoy pleasures with a woman who has hair, then I will cut off my hair - I will pluck it out. What to speak of other ornaments? This is the meaning of the word "api". Here, the cutting of hair is merely a symbol. I will endure all difficult tasks, such as going abroad with you, but you must not go anywhere else except with me. The meaning is that you should not stay even for a moment without me. This is my request to you. Whatever you command me, I will do it."

**Explanation:** This is to show how women, with their soft and persuasive nature, create trust through their initial pleasant interactions and then, through their words and actions, gain control over men.

**Verse 4:**

**Shadow:**  "Then, when he is available, they send him to do such tasks."

**Translation:** "When the virtuous man becomes available - falls under the woman's control - she sends him to do tasks like a servant. She says, "Bring a knife to cut the gourds, and bring me the best fruits, carefully selected."

**Commentary:** The word "athe" signifies continuity. The word "ṇam" is a figure of speech. After the initial pleasantries and the establishment of trust, when the virtuous man becomes "available" - recognized by the woman as being under her control through his appearance, gestures, or actions - then, knowing his intentions, she sends him to do tasks like a servant. This is to show how women, skilled in deception, use the virtuous man for menial tasks. The word "alabu" refers to a gourd or pumpkin. "Alabunchhed" is the knife used to cut it. The woman says, "Bring the knife, so that the mouth of the vessel can be properly shaped." "Valgu" means beautiful, and "phala" means fruits. She says, "Bring me beautiful fruits like coconuts and gourds." Alternatively, "vaakphala" refers to the fruits of speech, like religious discourses or explanations of grammar. She says, "Bring me the fruits of speech, or the benefits like clothes and other things."

**Further Commentary:**

In this verse, the word "ath" is used in the sense of continuity. The word "ṇam" is a figure of speech. After the initial pleasantries and the establishment of trust, when the women recognize the virtuous man as being under their control through his appearance, gestures, or actions, they, skilled in deception, use him for menial tasks. This is to show how women, with their soft and persuasive nature, create trust through their initial pleasant interactions and then, through their words and actions, gain control over men.

She also says, "Bring me ornaments like armlets and necklaces." "Kukkaya" refers to a veena with bells. "Bring me this veena for me." This way, adorned with all ornaments, I will play the veena and entertain you. "Lodham ca lodhakusumam ca" means "bring me the fruit and flower of the lodhra tree." "Veṇupalāsiyām ca" refers to a smooth bamboo stick, which is held in the left hand and played like a veena with the right hand. "Guliyam ca" means "bring me a medicinal pill."

The woman says, "Bring the Asandiya (a small couch or seat) made of the new Sutra (thread), and the Padullain (sandals) for walking around.
Then, for the sake of the Putradohala (special desire for a child), the men become like slaves, obeying her commands."

Commentary: The 'Asandiya' refers to a small couch or seat made of new, fresh thread, indicating its purity and newness. The 'Padullain' are sandals or footwear for walking around. 

The woman, being in the state of Putradohala (special craving or desire for a child during pregnancy), commands the men like slaves, making them obey her wishes to fulfill her cravings.

The verse highlights how the pregnant woman exercises authority over the men, just as masters command their slaves, in order to satisfy her special desires during pregnancy.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

Just as in the world, one's own name is the first joy, and the second is the joy of one's own self, and so on, in the same way, a son is the ultimate cause of happiness for men. When a son is born, the various anxieties that men experience for his sake are described as follows: "Take this child, you." "I am busy with my karma, I have no time to take him." Or, "Leave him, abandon him, I don't even want to hear about him." Thus, a woman, filled with anger, speaks. "I carried this child in my womb for nine months, and you are afraid to hold him for a little while?" The example of a servant is applicable here. He obeys his master's orders, not out of his own will, but out of fear. Similarly, a man, being under the control of a woman, considers it a favor and is happy to obey her orders. As it is said:

"Whatever pleases me, she does it. She knows it or not, whatever she does is pleasing to me." (1)

"She gives her life to a beggar, she kills her own mother for him. What can't she give, what can't she do for a man who begs her?" (2)

"She gives him water for purification, she washes his feet. She even takes his phlegm. A man is under the control of women." (3)

Thus, for the sake of a son, or for any other reason, men are ordered like servants. And those who are able to raise their sons, they are the ones who are described as "son-raisers." Because of their obedience to all orders, some, due to delusion, become like camels, under the control of women, carrying the burden of their instructions, and thus lose their worldly and otherworldly happiness. (16)

**Note:** The translation preserves the Jain terms "karma" and "son-raisers." The numbers in parentheses refer to the verses quoted from the text.

##  The Study of Women

Thus, men who nurture their sons and follow all the commands of the woman signified by this, who are situated in the arising of the great delusion-producing karma, who are obedient to women of the "woman-directive" type, and who do not care at all about the ruin of this world and the next, are like camels who carry burdens.

**Verse 17**

> "Those who are awake even at night, like a wet nurse, establish the child. Even though they are of a very modest mind, they become like swans, washing clothes."

**Commentary**

> Men who are under the control of women, even at night, get up and, like a wet nurse, comfort the crying child by various kinds of soothing words. They say to him, "My son, you are the lord of Nakrapur, Hastipatan, Kalpapattan, Simhapura, a high place, a low place, Kukkhipura, Kanyakubja, the grandfather's mouth, and Shauryapura." Thus, men who are under the control of women, by various kinds of playful words and conversations, make the child happy. They do such things that they become a laughingstock for everyone. Those whose minds are very modest, even though they are modest, abandon their modesty and do even the most despicable deeds at the behest of women. The sutra-maker shows this by the parts of the sutra: "Washers of clothes" - like swans, like washermen, they become. And because this is a sign, they also do other things like carrying water.

**Verse 18**

> "Thus, many have done this before, those who are devoted to enjoyment. Like a slave, like a deer, like a beast, he is not, or is he?"

**Commentary**

> Thus, many have done this before, those who are devoted to enjoyment. Like a slave, like a deer, like a beast, he is not, or is he?

English translation preserving Jain terms:

The Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra states that many individuals who have come under the sway of women continue to obey their commands. The man who is engrossed in sinful activities for the sake of sensual pleasures is like a deer trapped in a net, a purchased servant, or an animal - he is the most wretched of all.

Commentary - The statement "thus" refers to the previous mention of women's commands such as nurturing sons, washing clothes, etc. These have been performed by many worldly beings in the past, are being performed in the present, and will be performed in the future. Those men who, without considering the fear of karmic consequences in this life and the next, have become inclined towards and engaged in sinful activities - they perform all the aforementioned tasks. The man who is blinded by passion and is under the control of women, is assigned by those fearless women not only to the previously mentioned tasks, but also to many other such works. Just as a deer trapped in a net is dependent on others, unable to act according to his own will, and cannot even perform basic functions like eating, similarly the man under the sway of a woman becomes subservient, unable to carry out actions as per his own desire. He is employed like a purchased servant in cleaning, washing, and disposing of excreta and the like. Devoid of the discrimination between right and wrong conduct, and unaware of what is beneficial or harmful, he becomes like an animal - just as an animal knows only feeding, fear, and sexual urges, similarly this man, due to the lack of righteous conduct, is like an animal. Or, the man under the control of women is even more wretched than a servant, deer, purchased slave, or animal, as he is bereft of both - he is neither a renunciant monk due to the lack of righteous conduct, nor a householder due to the non-consumption of betel and the like, and mere hair-plucking. He is not among those who perform the duties of this world and the next, as neither this world nor the next is accomplished for him.

Now the author concludes this study and instructs the abandonment of association with women.

**Verse 19:**

* **Jain Terms:**  *taasu*, *vijnnapam*, *sanstavan*, *sanvasam*, *tajjaatika*, *avadyakara*

**Translation:**

* **Verse:**  "Knowing this, one should avoid contact, praise, and cohabitation with women. These desires, born from such contact, are declared by the omniscient ones to be harmful."

**Commentary:**

* **Explanation:**  "This" refers to the previous discussion about women. The verse advises monks to avoid any interaction with women, including praise and cohabitation, as such actions lead to harmful desires. The omniscient ones, like the Tirthankaras, have declared these desires to be harmful.

**Verse 20:**

* **Jain Terms:** *seyaay*, *appagam*, *nilambhitta*, *itthi*, *pasu*, *bhikkhu*, *paani*

**Translation:**

* **Verse:** "This fear is not conducive to liberation. Therefore, a monk should restrain himself, and not touch a woman, an animal, or even himself with his hands."

**Commentary:**

* **Explanation:**  The verse emphasizes that the fear of falling into harmful desires is not conducive to liberation. Therefore, a monk should restrain himself from any contact with women or animals, and even avoid touching himself with his hands. This emphasizes the importance of complete detachment and self-control for spiritual progress.

Jain Terms Preserved:

The Sravaka (ascetic) should abandon the company (samsara) of the Sutrakritanga Sutra, as it is stated that the bed should be devoid of women, animals, and eunuchs. Similarly, he should not touch his own genitals with his hand, as that would also corrupt his conduct. Further, he should not touch women, animals, etc. with his own hand.

The wise, pure-souled ascetic should renounce all external activities. The ascetic who endures all sensations - cold, heat, etc. - with his mind, speech, and body is truly a Anagara (homeless ascetic).

## Study of Women (Stri Parijna Adhyayan)

**I**

Do not cooperate with women, do not allow them to wash your feet, do not accept such service. A Sadhu should renounce all actions through mind, speech, and body. Do not even think about sensual pleasures, do not bring them to mind, and do not consider those who indulge in them as good. Do not engage in such actions through speech or body. This is what one should understand. There are nine types of sensual pleasures, and nine types of divine pleasures. A Sadhu should observe and maintain celibacy in eighteen ways. Just as a Sadhu endures the touch of a woman, he should also endure cold, heat, dance, mosquitoes, grass, and all other touches. One who endures all touches is an An-gaar Sadhu. Who said this? The Digdarshan reveals it.

**Dhuamohe se Bhikkhu**

**Icchevmaahu se Vire, Dhuarae Tamha Ajjathavisuddhe, Suvimukke Amokkaae Parivjjaasi || 22 ||**

**Ttibemi Ityevmaahu: Sa Vire Dhutaraja: Dhutmoha: Sa Bhikkhu.**

**Tasmadaatmavisuddha: Suvipraamukta: Amokksaya Parivrajediiti || Bravimi ||**

**Shadow**

**Om Om Om**

**Translation:** These aforementioned words were spoken by the Lord Mahavira, who has eradicated all karmas, destroyed delusion, and attained the state of being free from attachment. Therefore, a Sadhu who is Atma-visuddha (pure in soul), free from all attachments, should remain engaged in the path of renunciation (Parivrajya) and practice of self-control until he attains liberation (Amokksha).

**Commentary:** 'Iti' and all that was said before, that was spoken by the Lord Mahavira, who is born with divine knowledge and dedicated to the welfare of others. 'Aahu' means he said, 'Dhutam' means cleansed, 'Apanitam Rajah' means removed karma, 'Dhuta Raja' means one who has removed karma caused by contact with women, 'Dhuta Moha' means one who has overcome delusion in the form of attachment and aversion. Another interpretation is 'Dhuta' means cleansed, 'Apanita Ragamargo' means one who has abandoned the path of attachment, 'Ragapantha' means the path of attachment, 'Yasmin' means in whom, 'Stri Sansthavaadi Parihare' means in the renunciation of contact with women and other such things. All this was spoken by the Lord Mahavira, who is a hero. 'Tasmat' means therefore, 'Sa Bhikkhu' means that Sadhu, 'Adhyatmavisuddha' means pure in spirit, 'Suvishuddhantakarana' means one with a pure mind, 'Sustu Ragadveshatmaken Stri Samparken Mukta' means one who is completely free from the attachment and aversion associated with contact with women, 'Amokksaya' means for the sake of liberation, 'Aseha Karmakshayam Yavatpari' means until all karmas are completely destroyed, 'Samantaatsanyamanusthanena' means by practicing self-control in all aspects, 'Vrajet' means he should go, 'Sanyamodyogavan' means one who is dedicated to self-control. 'Iti' means thus, 'Bravimi' means I say, as before. || 22 ||

Thus ends the fourth study of women (Stri Parijna Adhyayan).

**Commentary:** The description given earlier was spoken by the Lord Mahavira, who is a divine knower, dedicated to the welfare of others. He had eradicated all karmas that arise from contact with women and bind one, and he had conquered delusion in the form of attachment and aversion. There is another interpretation here, according to which the Lord Mahavira said that one should renounce contact with women, including praise and familiarity, and should not be attached to them. Therefore, a Sadhu should remain dedicated to self-control, with a pure mind and completely free from the attachment and aversion associated with contact with women, until all karmas are completely destroyed. The word 'Iti' indicates the end. 'Bravimi' is as before.

Thus ends the fourth study of women (Stri Parijna Adhyayan).

## Shadow
Study of the hell division
And the great being, asked by me, the quick-witted Kashyap, said this. I will explain the suffering, the difficult-to-understand meaning, the evil-doer, in the future.

**Translation** - When asked by me, the great being - endowed with the glory of many excellences, the quick-witted - always useful in all things, the Lord Mahavira born in the Kashyap clan, said that the place of hell is extremely painful. It is unknowable by ignorant - non-omniscient beings. It is the dwelling place of sinful and lowly beings. I will explain this further.

**Commentary** - And thus, I, being humble, approached and asked the great one, who has the greatness of twenty-four excellences. The time of question and answer is 'this' - what will be spoken, as in the figure of speech. Knowing everything by omniscience, he answered my question, 'said'. Who is he? 'Kashyap' - the hero, the Vardhamana Swami, the quick-witted - because he is always useful everywhere. And thus, asked by me, the Lord said this - as whatever you have asked, I will 'explain' - tell you in the future, listen attentively. That is what he said - 'suffering' - hell is the cause of suffering, because of non-performance of good deeds, or - the dwelling in hell itself causes suffering, or - because of the arising of non-virtuous karma, there is intense suffering. This is also in terms of - when considered in ultimate reality, 'difficult' - deep, uneven, difficult to understand by the non-omniscient. The meaning is that there is no evidence to prove it. Or - 'difficult to understand' - the meaning is that which is the cause of suffering, or the purpose of suffering, that is the suffering-meaning - hell. And it is 'difficult' - uneven, because it is difficult to answer. I will explain that. Again, he distinguishes it - the place where the lowly, the most lowly, reside, that is the 'lowly-natured' - the dwelling place of extremely lowly beings. And the evil deed, the sin, or the fruit of sin, the arising of non-virtuous karma, exists in that, that is the 'evil-doer'. I will explain it 'in the future'. Or, the alternative reading is 'evil-doer' - those who have evil deeds, they are the evil-doers - the hell-dwellers. I will explain their related conduct 'in the future' - in the previous birth, what was done that made them eligible for going to hell.

**Commentary on the Commentary** - The disciple of Lord Mahavira, Shri Sudharma Swami, says that I went to the presence of that Lord, who has twenty-four excellences, and asked this. Then he said this - after asking the question, the Lord answered in the form of what will be spoken in the future. In this verse, 'mo' has come in the sense of the figure of speech. Lord Mahavira, knowing all things by omniscience, answered my question. Who is the Lord? He is the Lord Vardhamana Swami, born in the Kashyap clan. He is quick-witted, because he is always useful in all things. When I asked the question, the Lord said this - whatever you have asked, I will explain in the future, listen attentively. He says - the land of hell is the cause of suffering, it is painful because it is the fruit of evil deeds, or - it is painful for beings. Or - because of the arising of non-virtuous karma, there are intense sufferings in the land of hell. Therefore, they are in the form of suffering. It is difficult for non-omniscient beings to know the land of hell, that is, they cannot know, because there is no evidence that can prove the existence of hell. This is the meaning. Or - the land of hell is created only for giving suffering, therefore it is suffering-meaning. It is difficult to cross that land, it is difficult. Therefore, it is 'difficult', I will explain it.

Again, the author explains the characteristic of the land of hell - the land of hell is such that lowly beings reside all around, that is, it is the dwelling place of lowly beings, in it, evil deeds, sin, or the fruit of sin, non-virtuous karma, exists, therefore it is called 'evil-doer'.

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra
I shall explain. In this context, there is also a variant reading 'dukkadinam', which means that I shall also describe the sinful karmas acquired in the past life, which have resulted in the residence of the wicked souls in the hell realms.

Those few ignorant living beings who, for the sake of protecting their own lives, commit sinful acts like violence against other living beings, fall into the extremely terrifying, intensely agonizing Naraka (hell) realms, enveloped in thick darkness.

Explanation: 
These are the ones who have engaged in sinful activities like great attachment, violence against the five senses, and flesh-eating, etc. Being 'balas' (ignorant) with intense passions of attachment and aversion, they are living beings seeking to protect their own lives in this Samsara. They commit 'raudra' (terrible) acts like violence and falsehood. Such sinful individuals, immersed in the arising of intense karmas, fall into the extremely terrifying 'ghorarupe' (horrific) 'tamissandhyare' (enveloped in thick darkness) Naraka, where even with the eyes, one can barely perceive, like an owl in the day. As described in the scriptures - "O Gautama! In the Naraka, how much area can the embodied being perceive with his vision? He can perceive only a limited area, not a vast area." Similarly, the intense, unbearable heat like a heap of glowing charcoal is the 'tivvabhitape' (intense anguish) in that Naraka, where the beings attached to sense pleasures, burdened by their own karmas, fall and experience various torments.

## Hellish Torment: A Study

**Verse 6:**  
The vultures, with their sharp beaks, tear at the bound, their heads thrown back in agony. Their bodies are firmly gripped, their tongues ripped out, their flesh consumed.

**Verse 1:**  
The vultures, with their sharp beaks, tear at the bound, their heads thrown back in agony. Their bodies are firmly gripped, their flesh consumed, their tongues ripped out.

**Verse 7:**  
Their bodies, mangled and torn, are pierced by sharp thorns, their bones shattered. Even a moment of respite is a rare luxury, their suffering unending.

**Verse 1:**  
Their bodies, mangled and torn, are pierced by sharp thorns, their bones shattered. Even a moment of respite is a rare luxury, their suffering unending.

This is the terrifying hell where countless beings suffer. Only those who have abandoned truth and accumulated a mountain of sins find themselves in this abyss.

**Verse 1:**  
This is the terrifying hell where countless beings suffer. Only those who have abandoned truth and accumulated a mountain of sins find themselves in this abyss.

**Commentary:**  
Those who are consumed by attachment and aversion, who engage in grand enterprises and accumulate vast possessions, who kill sentient beings, consume flesh, and indulge in other sinful acts, who desire a life of unrestrained indulgence, and who commit acts of violence, deceit, and other transgressions, will, upon the ripening of their karma, be plunged into the terrifying darkness of hell.

Here, their bodies are invisible to their own eyes, their vision clouded like that of an owl in the daytime, despite possessing the knowledge of clairvoyance.

The scriptures describe this state:

"O Lord, how far can a being in hell, marked by the black karma, see with their clairvoyance?"

"Gautama, they cannot see very far, only a small area. They can only see a small area, and their vision is limited."

These beings, burdened by their heavy karma, are plunged into the fiery depths of hell, where the heat is more intense than a mountain of burning coals. They are unable to renounce the pleasures of the senses, and thus they suffer unimaginable torment.

It is said:

"Those who do not renounce the pleasures of the senses will fall into hell, where flames of fire rage and where suffering reigns supreme."

In hell, the righteous gods trample upon the chests of the damned, their mouths spewing blood. They are torn apart by sharp iron saws, their bodies ripped in two. The cries of the tortured fill the air, their bones crackle and shatter as they are roasted alive. They are pierced with skewers, their bodies lifted high. This is a place of terrifying sounds, impenetrable darkness, and foul stench.

The damned are imprisoned in chains, their bodies mangled and broken, their flesh dripping with blood and fat. Their heads are severed, their bodies dismembered. Their tongues are ripped out by burning tongs. Their bodies are torn and shredded against thorny trees. They are denied even a moment of respite, their suffering unending.

The Sutra Kritanga Sutra states that men who kill various types of living beings, are liars, and generate a mass of sins, go to terrifying hells.

**Verse 4:**

* **Original:** तिव्वं तसे पाणिगो थावरे य, जे हिसंती आयसुहं पडुच्चा । जे लूसए होइ अदत्त हारी, ण सिक्खती सेयवियस्स किंचि ॥४॥ छाया - तीवं त्रसान् स्थावरान् योहिनस्त्यात्मसुखं प्रतीत्य ।
 _ योलूषको भवत्यदत्तहारी, न शिक्षते सेवनीयस्य किञ्चित् ॥
* **Translation:** Those who, for their own comfort and pleasure, cruelly and mercilessly kill both mobile and immobile beings, oppress them, cause them suffering, and take the possessions of others without permission, do not learn even a little about the practice of self-control, which is beneficial for oneself.

**Verse 5:**

* **Original:** पागब्भि पाणे बहुणं तिवाति, अतिव्वतेघातमुवेति बाले । णिहो णिसं गच्छति अंतकाले, अहो सिरं कटु उवेइ दुग्गं ॥५॥ छाया - प्रागल्भी प्राणानां बहूनामतिपाती, अनिर्वतो घातमुपैति बालः ।
न्यग् निशां गच्छत्यन्तकाले, अधः शिरः कृत्वोपैति दुर्गम् ॥ 
* **Translation:** The man who is bold and arrogant in killing many living beings, who is always burning with the fire of anger, and who is ignorant, goes to hell. At the time of death, he goes down into darkness, with his head bowed, to a place of great suffering.

Page #339:
---------------------------
## Hellish Torment: A Jain Perspective

**Study of Hellish Torment**

And so, the cruel, lion-like, serpent-natured, inherently violent being, the "un-freed" one, who is never pacified by the fire of anger, or perhaps the greedy fisherman, who is always consumed by the desire to kill, and who never finds peace, suffers in hell. This is the consequence of his own actions. He is drawn to hell, to its proximity. Who is this? It is the "child," the ignorant one, who is ruled by attachment and aversion. At the time of death, he falls down, into the darkness below. He goes to the darkness below. Thus, with his head bowed down in shame for his evil deeds, he reaches the "difficult" place, the place of torment. He falls into hell, head down. || 5 ||

Now, to show what the inhabitants of hell experience, the text says:

**Commentary:**

Here, boldness is called "fearlessness" or "confidence." A man who is bold is also called "fearless." One whose nature is to kill many beings is called "violent." The point is that a man who commits violence against beings, with arrogance, says that the violence prescribed in the Vedas is not really violence, or that it is the duty of kings to hunt for pleasure, and that there is no fault in eating meat, drinking alcohol, or engaging in sexual misconduct, because these are natural for beings. To be free from these things, to abandon them, is a great benefit. The one who is merciless, like a lion or a black snake, who by nature kills beings, or who makes a living by killing animals or fish, who always has the intention to kill, who never finds peace, goes to hell. There, he suffers the consequences of his actions. Who is this? He is ignorant, devoid of wisdom. He is ruled by attachment and aversion. He dies and goes down, to the lower realms, to darkness. As a result of his sins, he goes to a terrible place of torment, with his head bowed down. This means that he falls into hell, head down.

**Verse 6:**

"Kill, cut, break, burn," they hear the sounds of the supremely righteous. The inhabitants of hell, their minds shattered by fear, wonder, "Which direction should we go?" || 6 ||

**Commentary:**

The beings who have been born in hell, having been previously animals or humans, produce bodies like those of birds, within a moment. They have reached the point of exhaustion and hear the terrifying sounds made by the supremely righteous. These sounds are like, "Kill!" with a hammer, "Cut!" with a sword, "Break!" with a spear, "Burn!" with a firebrand, and so on. Hearing these terrible sounds, the inhabitants of hell, with eyes filled with fear, their minds shattered by fear and terror, lose their senses. They are those whose inner consciousness is lost. They wonder, "Which direction should we go?" They long for escape from this terrible, dreadful, and painful suffering. || 6 ||

They are filled with fear and lost in confusion. To show what they experience, the text says:

Page #340:
---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Commentary:** To show how beings born in hell experience suffering, the Sutrakar says: Creatures born in hell, after leaving the animal and human realms, are born with bodies like birds that have just hatched from eggs, without feathers or down.  Then, they experience the feeling of fullness and hear the terrifying words of the Narada Devas.  These words are like: "Strike them with a mace, pierce them with a sword, cut them, impale them with a spear, string them up, burn them with fire, etc."  Here, the word "ṇam" is used in the sense of a figure of speech.  Hearing these painful and terrifying words, the hell-bound beings become frightened, their eyes widen, and their minds tremble.  They want to know in which direction to go, where to go, to escape these terrible and excruciating sufferings.

**Verse:**

Om Om Om

Ingalaraasim jalayam sajotim tattovaman bhumimanukkamantan. Te dajmana kalunam thanti, arahassara tattha chiradvitiya. ||7||

**Shadow:**

Angararasim jvalitam sajyotīḥ tadupamām bhūmim anukrāmantaḥ.
Te dahyamānāḥ karuṇam stananti arahasvarāḥ tatra chirasthitikaḥ. ||

**Translation:** Just as a pile of burning coals is very hot and the earth with fire is extremely hot, spewing fire, so too is the hellish earth extremely hot.  Walking on it, the hell-bound beings burn and cry out loudly.  They dwell there for a long time.

**Commentary:** "Angararasim" means a pile of burning coals, "jvalitam" means blazing with flames, and "sajyoti" means existing with light, i.e., with fire.  The earth that is like this, with fire, is called "sajyotibhumi."  The hell-bound beings, walking on this earth that is like burning coals, are burning and crying out in pain.  "Karunam" means pitiful, and "stananti" means they cry out.  Here, it is said that the earth is like a blazing fire because there is no other fire in hell.  This is said to show the suffering, otherwise, the suffering of hell cannot be compared to fire.  The hell-bound beings, burning with a heat greater than that of a great city fire, are "arahaasvara" - those with loud voices, and "santan" - they exist, "tatra" - in that hellish abode, "chira" - for a long time, "stiti" - their dwelling, "avasthanam" - their state.  Thus, they dwell for a long time, from a minimum of ten thousand years to a maximum of thirty-three oceans worth of time. ||7||

**Commentary:** There is a pile of burning coals, and there is the earth with fire.  Walking on that earth, like a pile, and burning, they cry out and scream.  In hell, there is no "badar" - gross fire.

**Commentary:** Just as burning "khadir" - "khair" wood is like the hellish earth, so too are the hell-bound beings like burning coals.  They cry out in pain, great suffering.  Therefore, the Sutrakar has compared the hellish earth to "badar" fire, showing that it is similar.  This comparison is only to show the suffering, because the suffering of hell cannot be compared to fire here.  Burning with a heat greater than that of a fire in a large city, the hell-bound beings cry out and make a great noise.  They dwell in hell for a very long time.  They dwell in hell for a maximum of thirty-three oceans worth of time and a minimum of ten thousand years.

**Verse:**

Jai

Te suya 'veyarani bhidugga, nisio jaha khur iv tikkhasoya. Taranti te veyarani bhidugga, ussu choiya sattisu hammana. ||8||

**Translation:** You may have heard about the river Vaitarani, which has a sharp edge like a razor. That river is very difficult to cross. It is very difficult to even go near it. The beings of hell, tormented by sharp arrows, iron thorns, and weapons with sharp points like spears and tridents, jump into that river in fear.
**Study of Hell Divisions**
If you have heard about this Vaitarani, which is difficult to cross and has a current as sharp as a razor. Those who are tormented by weapons and spears, jump into that difficult to cross Vaitarani.
**Commentary:** Sudharmaswami says to Jambuswami - As the Bhagavan has said, if you have heard about the river Vaitarani, which is a river of saline, hot, and blood-like water, and is difficult to cross, and causes suffering. And, just as a razor is sharp, so are its currents, which are sharp enough to cut off body parts. Those beings of hell, who have left behind the earth, which is like burning coals, and are thirsty, jump into that terrifying Vaitarani to relieve their suffering. How are they? They are tormented by arrows, spears, and weapons, and they jump into that terrifying Vaitarani. Here, the seventh case ending is used in the third case.
**Commentary Meaning:** Shri Sudharmaswami says to Jambuswami that the Bhagavan Mahavira has said about the river Vaitarani, which has saline, hot, and blood-like water. Just as the edge of a razor is very sharp, so is the current of that river. The beings of hell suffer greatly when they touch that current. Therefore, it is very difficult to cross, and it causes suffering. The beings of hell, who are burning and thirsty, leave behind the earth, which is like burning coals, and jump into that terrifying river to bathe and relieve their suffering. How are they? They are tormented by arrows, iron thorns, or spears, and they jump into that terrifying Vaitarani. Here, the seventh case ending is used in the third case.

**Translation:** The beings of hell, tormented by the suffering of Vaitarani, start to get on the boat, then the hellish deities who are already there pierce the necks of those unfortunate ones with nails. Those who have already lost their senses due to the suffering of Vaitarani, have lost their minds. Those beings of hell are further distressed by this suffering. Some other hellish deities, for their own amusement, pierce the beings of hell with spears and tridents and throw them on the earth.
**Commentary:** Those beings of hell, who are tormented by the saline, hot, and foul-smelling water of Vaitarani, approach the boat, which is full of nails. The 'Asadhu Karma' (those who have done bad deeds), who are very righteous, pierce them in their necks with nails. Those who are being pierced, tremble and shake.

## Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Verse 9:**

Those who follow the path of the *sarvatra-oto* (all-pervading) are destroyed by the waters of the *Vaitarani* (river of hell). Even those who have lost their senses are quickly deprived of their memories and lose their ability to discern their duties. Others are tormented by the *naraka-pala* (hell guardians) who play with them, piercing them with tridents, spears, and long rods, and then throw them down to the earth below.

**Verse 10:**

Some have stones tied around their necks and are plunged into the deep waters. Others are tossed about in the hot sand and embers, where they are roasted.

**Commentary:**

The *Vaitarani* is a river of extremely salty, hot, and foul-smelling water. The tormented beings of hell are forced onto boats made of iron, studded with sharp nails and thorns. The *naraka-deva* (hell gods) who are already on these boats pierce the throats of these beings with sharp nails. As the beings lose their senses in the rushing waters of the *Vaitarani*, they are further deprived of their memories by the pain of the sharp thorns. They have no knowledge of their duties. Other *naraka-pala* play with the beings of hell, impaling them on long tridents and spears, and then throwing them to the ground.

Some have large stones tied around their necks and are plunged into the deep waters. Others are dragged and rubbed in the extremely hot sand and embers. They are tossed about like chickpeas being roasted. Other *naraka-deva* roast these beings of hell, who are bound by the chains of their karma, like meat being roasted on a spit.

**Verse 11:**

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra states that his intellect is destroyed. He becomes devoid of discrimination and discrimination, and continues to burn excessively. He is pitiable-pity-producing in all time-present, past and future, or is a completely hot place. He is attained by sinful living beings, i.e., sinful souls go there. Describing the speciality of that place, the Sutrakara says - it is extremely painful. The implication is that even for the twinkling of an eye, there is no relief from suffering there. It is said - even in the time of the blink of an eye, the hellish beings do not get respite, they continue to cook in hell, suffering and experiencing pain.

The four fires are kindled, wherein the cruel-actioned torment the ignorant. They stand there, tormented, living like fish in the fire.

Tika: In all four directions, the cruel-actioned hell-wardens, having kindled four fires, torment extremely the ignorant beings who have committed misdeeds in the past. And those hell-beings, thus tormented, stand there for a long time in that extremely painful hell, unable to go elsewhere, just as living fish, having reached the proximity of fire, stand there itself, unable to go elsewhere due to their inability to bear the heat, and thus great suffering arises for them; hence the analogy of fish is taken.

Further, 

Santacchana (Intense Burning) is the name of the great torment; there the unrighteous-actioned (beings) are bound by hands and feet, and are sawed like logs by those with axes in their hands.

## Hell Division Study - Translation

**Santanaksha** is a hell. It inflicts great suffering on beings. In it, the cruel **Parmadhami** Devas, holding axes in their hands, bind the hands and feet of the hellish beings and chop them like wood.

**Commentary:**  The term **Santanaksha** refers to a place where beings are chopped with unity. The word **Santanaksha** is used in the sense of possibility. It is possible that this hell called **Santanaksha** causes great suffering to all beings. If this is the case, then what? The sutrakar answers this question by saying that in that hell, the cruel **Parmadhami** Devas, who are merciless and devoid of compassion, come from their abode with axes in their hands and bind the hands and feet of the helpless hellish beings, who have no protector, and chop them like wood.

**Furthermore:**

The **Parmadhami** Devas extract the blood of the hellish beings, heat it in a cauldron, and then throw the hellish beings into that blood, cooking them like live fish. The bodies of these hellish beings are swollen with excrement, and their heads are shattered.

**Commentary:**  The **Parmadhami** Devas throw the hellish beings into a cauldron of their own boiling blood. The intestines and other organs of these hellish beings are swollen due to excrement. Their heads are shattered. How are they cooked? The sutrakar says that they are cooked by turning them over. The hellish beings, who are lying on their backs, are turned over, and those who are lying on their stomachs are turned over. The word **"nam"** is used here in the sense of a figure of speech. The hellish beings, who are being cooked in this way, are agitated and toss and turn their bodies, writhing in pain. The **Parmadhami** Devas cook them like live fish in an iron cauldron.

Page #346:
---------------------------
The Sutra Kritanga Sutra says: "They do not become ashes in the fire of hell, nor do they die from the intense torment. They experience the consequences of their actions, suffering in this world due to their misdeeds." (16)

Commentary: "These hell beings, even though they are repeatedly burned, do not become ashes in hell, nor do they die from the torment. The intensity of their suffering cannot be compared to the pain of a fish thrown into fire. It is a suffering beyond description. Even though they experience intense torment, they do not die because they still have to experience the consequences of their actions. They continue to experience the consequences of their actions, suffering from the cold and heat, burning, cutting, piercing, scraping, impaling, cooking in a pot, climbing the salmali tree, and other torments inflicted by the gods. They suffer from the consequences of their actions, especially the eighteen types of sins, including violence. They do not find even a moment of respite from their suffering." (16)

"They go towards the blazing fire to escape the cold, but they do not find relief. They are tormented by the intense heat of the fire. The gods further torment them." (17)

**Commentary:**

The text 'tasmincha' in the sutra clearly describes the place of great torment, hell. It is filled with the commotion of the hell-bound beings. Those who are tormented by extreme cold seek relief in the intensely hot fire. They are burned in the fiery fortress, finding no solace. They are constantly consumed by the fire, experiencing great pain. Even though they are already suffering, the hell-keepers further torment them by burning them with extremely hot oil and fire. ||17||

**Commentary:**

Hell is a place of extreme torment. The sutra-maker highlights its characteristics by saying:

Hell is filled with the commotion of the hell-bound beings. Those who are tormented by extreme cold seek relief in the intensely hot fire. They are burned in the fiery fortress, finding no solace. They are constantly consumed by the fire, experiencing great pain. Even though they are already suffering, the hell-keepers further torment them by burning them with extremely hot oil and fire.

**Verse 18:**

**Shadow:**

And it is heard, like the sound of a city being destroyed, the words of sorrow are uttered there. Those who have ripened karma, those who have ripened karma, again and again they torment them with great force.

**Translation:**

When a city is destroyed, there is a great commotion of the people due to their sorrow. Similarly, in that city, a commotion is heard, sorrowful words are uttered. Those whose false beliefs, etc., karma has ripened, who are in the state of experiencing the fruits of their sinful karma, they, the hell-keepers, torment the hell-bound beings with great enthusiasm, again and again.

**Commentary:**

The word 'se' in this verse means 'ath' (then). After that, the terrifying roar of the hell-bound beings, who are being tormented by the fierce hell-keepers, is heard, like the sound of a city being destroyed. In hell, words filled with sorrow are uttered, such as "Oh mother! Father! I am in great distress, I am an orphan, I have no master, I have come to you for refuge, save me!" etc. Those whose karma of false beliefs, laughter, and sensual pleasures has ripened, they, the hell-keepers, torment the hell-bound beings with great enthusiasm, again and again, causing them unbearable suffering of various kinds. ||18||

The Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra repeatedly and enthusiastically inflicts extremely unbearable suffering on those whose bitter fruits have manifested.

The wicked, ignorant nether world guardians separate the limbs of the nether world beings. I shall explain to you the reason for this truthfully. The childlike ones are reminded there by all the punishments of their past deeds.

Commentary: The word 'na' is a figure of speech. The sinful nether world guardians disintegrate the body parts of the nether world beings through methods like cutting, for which the author explains the reason - I shall expound to you the true cause. The unintelligent nether world guardians remind them through various punishments, just as you used to joyfully cut and consume the flesh of other beings, drink their juices, and indulge in adultery; now, tormented by the fruits of those same deeds, why are you howling and shrieking? In this way, the nether world guardians inflict suffering similar to the punishments given by them in the previous birth, thereby tormenting them.

They, being struck down, fall into the nether world, in the great torment of the deformed one. There they stand, devourers of the deformed, satisfied by the worms that have arisen from their karmas.

The unfortunate hellish beings are killed and beaten by the hell guardians, and they fall into another extremely terrible hell, a part of hell. What is that hell like? It is filled with excrement, blood, flesh, and other impure, foul substances, and it is filled with extreme heat. Bound by the web of their own karma, these hellish beings dwell in such a hell, consuming impure substances for a long time.

They are bitten by insects produced by the hell guardians and by insects motivated by each other, as a result of their own karma. The scripture mentions in this regard that in the sixth and seventh hells, the hellish beings become a very large, bloody worm called Kunthuru, and they bite each other's bodies, causing great pain. ❀❀

English translation with Jain terms preserved:

The Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra has been attained through the state of karma that is accomplished and purified. Describing the speciality towards the Naraka (hell), it is said that it is extremely painful, inherently distressing. The Narakapala (guardians of hell) in such Naraka places, break and twist the bodies of the existing beings, putting them in shackles and other bindings, and piercing their heads. They stretch out their limbs like leather and drive nails into them.

"They cut the nose of the child with a razor, and they also cut both the ears. They pull out his tongue to the extent of a span, and they torture him with sharp spikes." (Verse 22)

Commentary: They, the extremely righteous ones, reminding of the past misdeeds of the ignorant, Narakiya (hellish) beings, who are mostly always in the state of experiencing pain, cut their nose with a razor, and also cut both their ears. And, pulling out the tongue of those who are desirous of liquor, meat and tastes, and who speak falsehood, to the extent of a span, they 'torture' (remove) them with sharp spikes.

"They, being burnt, make sounds like the dry leaves of the palm tree, day and night, there. They drip with blood and pus-filled flesh, their limbs being smeared with caustic substances." (Verse 23)

Commentary: They, having their nose, lips and tongue cut, dripping with blood, where they spend the night and day making sounds like the dry leaves of the palm tree, the ignorant Narakiya beings, their limbs being smeared with caustic substances, drip with blood and pus-filled flesh.

## Hellish Torment: A Translation

**Verse 23:**

The study of hellish torments:
They cry out with long, drawn-out wails, burning with fire, their bodies smeared with alkali. Blood, pus, and flesh melt away night and day.

**Verse 24:**

Perhaps you have heard of the hell called "Kumbhi," filled with blood and pus. There, blood and pus are cooked. The new fire, with its intense heat, is extremely hot. It is larger than a man in size.

**Verse 25:**

They throw the children into it, and they cry out in pain. Thirsty, they drink the copper-heated liquid, and cry out in pain.

Page #352:
---------------------------
Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra Translation - The merciful and compassionate divine beings throw those ignorant and miserable hellish beings into a cauldron filled with blood and pus, and cook them. They make the thirsty and tormented hellish beings drink molten lead and copper. Therefore, those hellish beings cry out even more.

Commentary - They throw the helpless, wailing hellish beings, whose bodies are filled with the impurities of blood, pus, and foul odor, into the cauldron that is ablaze like a new fire in the hells. The tormented hellish beings cry out in anguish. When they, afflicted by extreme thirst, beg for water, the hell-wardens remind them that they were very fond of liquor, and make them drink the scorching lead and copper. They cry out in even greater anguish while drinking it.

Summarizing the topic, it is said:
Having deceived others for the sake of trivial pleasures in this human life, they are reborn hundreds of thousands of times in the lower realms, like fish-hunters. And then they go to hell. As were their past actions, so are the burdens they bear.

Commentary - In this human life, by deceiving others with their own self-interest, they have abandoned their true self. Having experienced hundreds of thousands of births in the lower realms like fish-hunters, they now reside in hell. As were the wicked deeds they committed in their past lives, so are the torments they now endure.

Page #353:
---------------------------
Hellish suffering is produced by remembering the study of hellish states, thus it is well said that the karma of the beings is the burden they bear, as a result of the fruition of that karma. ||26|| And another thing - 
_Commentary - In this human life, the man who is inclined to cheat others, cheats himself. He deprives his soul by harming other beings for the sake of a little insignificant pleasure. As a result, he takes birth in many births, hundreds of thousands of times, as a fisherman who catches fish, a tiger hunter, and other low castes. In those births, he is greedy for worldly pleasures. He acts contrary to virtuous deeds. As a result, he goes to a terrible and very fearful hell. The beings in hell, suffering from their karma, live for a long time, causing pain to each other.
The sutrakar reveals the reason for this, saying that the being who has done heinous, hateful, and even more hateful karma in his previous birth, with such determination, receives the same kind of pain and suffering. That pain is also self-inflicted. It is also inflicted by others, and it is also both self-inflicted and inflicted by others. Those who were meat-eaters in their previous birth are fed their own flesh cooked in fire. Those who drank meat juice in their previous birth are given their own blood and pus to drink, and they are also given molten lead to drink. The fish-killers and hunters of previous births, who killed fish and deer, etc., are killed and cut in the same way. Those who spoke falsely have their tongues cut off, reminding them of their past deeds. Those who stole the wealth of others in their previous birth have their limbs cut off. Those who were adulterers have their testicles cut off and are made to embrace a thorny tree. Similarly, those who were great accumulators, great hoarders, angry, proud, and deceitful are given the same kind of torture, reminding them of all that. Therefore, it is rightly said that one has to suffer the consequences of one's actions.
_Commentary - The unrighteous people, having earned sins, dwell in hell, which is devoid of desired and beloved things, and is full of foul smell, bad touch, flesh and blood, etc.
_Commentary - The unrighteous, due to their unrighteous actions, having earned sins through the doors of violence, falsehood, theft, etc., dwell in a foul-smelling place. What kind of place is it? - They are devoid of objects of desire, beautiful things, and various kinds of excellence. They dwell in hell, or they are polluted by those who pollute them, such as mother and son.
325)

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

The one who is freed from worldly attachments like spouse, children, and other objects of desire, becomes solitary and dwells in the hell called "Durabhigandha," which is more foul-smelling than a decaying corpse. He is enveloped in complete and utterly inauspicious touch, a place of constant anxiety and suffering. He is afflicted with the "kunime" (a state of extreme suffering), his body filled with flesh, blood, pus, intestines, and other impurities. He is surrounded by the most abominable sights and sounds, his ears deafened by the cries of "Ha! Ha!" and the constant lamentations of "Oh, how painful!" He dwells in this most wretched hell, surrounded by thirty-three oceans, for as long as his lifespan. This is the end of the explanation. I speak as before. ||27||

**Commentary:**

The unrighteous person indulges in unrighteous actions. They consume the poisons of violence, falsehood, and theft, accumulating immense negative karma. As a result, they become cruel and are condemned to the foul-smelling hell. 

How do these hellish beings exist? They are devoid of all desirable objects, including pleasant sounds and loved ones. They are separated from their parents, children, spouses, and all those for whom they committed sins. They are alone, dwelling in a place that is more foul-smelling than a decaying corpse. They are constantly tormented by the touch of flesh, fat, blood, pus, intestines, and other impurities. They are surrounded by the most repulsive sights and sounds, their ears deafened by the cries of "Ha! Ha!" and the constant lamentations of "Oh, how painful!" They dwell in this most wretched hell, surrounded by thirty-three oceans, for as long as their lifespan.

The word "iti" signifies the end of the explanation. "Bravimi" means "I speak," and it should be understood in the same way as before.

Thus ends the first explanation of the hellish realm.

The second objective of the fifth study is being commenced. The first objective has been stated. Now, the second objective is being stated. The connection between them is this: in the subsequent objective, it has been stated what actions cause beings to be born in hell and what their conditions are like. Here, the same thing is being stated in a more specific way. Thus, in accordance with the sūtra of this objective, which has been introduced, the sūtra should be uttered with qualities like being free from errors, etc. That sūtra is this:

**"Atha avaram sāsayadukkha-dhamma, tam bhe pavakkhāmi jahātaheṇaṁ. Bālā jahā dukkad-akamma-kārī, vedanti kammaiṁ purekadaiṁ."** (1)

**Commentary:**

"Atha" means "furthermore" or "in addition to what has been said before." "Avaram" means "another" or "different." "Sāsayadukkha-dhamma" means "the dharma of eternal suffering." "Tam" refers to the "sāsayadukkha-dhamma." "Bhe" means "to you" or "to all of you." "Pavakkhāmi" means "I will explain" or "I will tell you." "Jahātaheṇaṁ" means "truthfully" or "as it is." "Bālā" means "foolish" or "ignorant." "Jahā" means "just as" or "in the same way." "Dukkad-akamma-kārī" means "those who do evil deeds." "Vedanti" means "they experience" or "they suffer." "Kammaiṁ" means "their actions" or "their karma." "Purekadaiṁ" means "those done in the past" or "those done in previous lives."

**Translation:**

"Furthermore, I will explain to you truthfully the dharma of eternal suffering. Just as foolish people who do evil deeds experience the consequences of their actions done in the past, so too will I explain to you the consequences of your actions."

**Explanation:**

This verse is a continuation of the previous discussion about hell. The speaker is now going to explain in detail the nature of hell and the suffering that those who are born there experience. The speaker uses the analogy of foolish people who do evil deeds and then suffer the consequences of their actions. This is to illustrate that those who are born in hell are also suffering the consequences of their past actions.

The speaker emphasizes that he will explain the truth about hell without any embellishment or exaggeration. He will not try to make it sound more pleasant or less painful than it actually is. He will speak the truth, even if it is unpleasant.

The speaker also uses the term "sāsayadukkha-dhamma" to describe hell. This term literally means "the dharma of eternal suffering." This is a very important term because it highlights the fact that hell is not a temporary state of suffering. It is a state of eternal suffering.

The speaker is now going to explain in detail the different types of hell and the suffering that those who are born there experience. He will also explain how to avoid being born in hell.

The wretched beings who do not contemplate on the Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra and indulge in the conduct of the defiled karmas like Jnanavaraniya, I shall describe how they experience the fruits of the evil deeds accumulated in their previous births in the Naraka (hell).

With their hands and feet bound, they disembowel their abdomen with razor-sharp weapons. Seizing the mutilated body of the child-like ignorant Narakiya (hellish) beings, they forcefully extract the firm skin from their backs.

The extremely unrighteous Devas, due to the fruition of such karmas, bind the hands and feet of those Narakiyas and lacerate their abdomen with various kinds of weapons. Similarly, they severely beat and injure the bodies of other ignorant Narakiya beings, who are incapable of any resistance like a child, and then forcefully peel off the skin from their backs.

Further, they uproot the arms of those beings from the roots, and insert hot iron balls into their wide-open mouths. In secrecy, they remind them of their past misdeeds, and then mercilessly whip their backs, inflicting grievous wounds.

Hell Division Study. • Commentary - 'They' (the Narakas) in the three hellish earths, the Paramādhmī Devas, and the other Narakas, from the bottom four, originally, 'cut off' their arms, sever them, and 'in the mouth', with a gaping mouth, 'throw' large, hot, fiery balls, burning them from all sides. And 'in secret', alone, 'fittingly', appropriately, according to the suffering they have created, they remind them of their past lives, 'the child' (the Naraka), for example, at the time of being given hot lead, they say, "You were a drunkard," and at the time of eating their own flesh, they say, "You were a meat-eater," thus reminding them of their past actions, they torment them. And 'without reason', they become 'angry', and with a whip, etc., they strike the Naraka on the back, making him subject to their will. ||3|| Also -
_Commentary Meaning – In the three hellish earths, the Paramādhmī Devas cut off the arms of the Narakīya beings from the root, sever them, and the Narakīya beings who live there also cut off each other's arms from the root, sever them. In the bottom four hellish earths, the Narakīya beings only cut off each other's arms from the root, sever them. The Paramādhmī Devas open the mouths of the Narakas and throw large, hot, fiery balls into them, burning them. They take those Narakīya beings to a secluded place and remind them of the actions they performed in their past lives, the results of which they are experiencing, the torments they are undergoing. When they give them hot lead to drink, they say, "Remember, you used to drink a lot of alcohol." When they feed them their own flesh, they say, "Remember, you used to eat a lot of meat." Thus, they remind them of their past actions, in accordance with their suffering, and torment them. Without any reason, they become angry and strike those helpless Narakīya beings on their backs with whips.
This, like a burning flame, they walk on the earth. . They are burning, they cry out in pain, they are driven by arrows, they are bound in the hot yoke. ||4|| Shadow - This is like a burning flame, they walk on the earth.

The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states:

**Verse 5:**

The **Balas** (souls devoid of discrimination) are forcibly made to traverse the **Lohpath** (path of burning iron), a scorching earth, slippery with blood and pus. They are driven forward like cattle, prodded with sticks, as they approach the **Abhidurg** (impenetrable fortress).

**Commentary:**

The **Naraka-palas** (hell-keepers) force the **Balas** to walk on the burning **Lohpath**, a scorching earth, slippery with blood and pus. They are driven forward like cattle, prodded with sticks, as they approach the **Abhidurg** (impenetrable fortress). The **Balas** are unable to move freely and are forced to endure this torment.

**Verse 6:**

Those who enter the **Sampragadh** (intense suffering) are struck by falling stones. The **Santapini** (hell of torment) is a place of long duration, where the **Asadhu-karma** (evil deeds) are burned away.

**Commentary:**

The **Narakas** (hell-bound beings) are unable to move freely in the **Sampragadh** (intense suffering) and are struck by falling stones. The **Santapini** (hell of torment) is a place of long duration, where the **Asadhu-karma** (evil deeds) are burned away. The **Narakas** suffer greatly in this hell, enduring intense pain for a long time.

## Study of Hellish Torments - Commentary

Those who have fallen into the unbearable, painful hell, or any path leading there, are unable to escape or endure it. They are struck by stones hurled by Asuras. The torment that afflicts beings on all sides is called **Santapini**, which is the **Kumbhi hell**. This state lasts for a long time, meaning that a being who has gone to Kumbhi hell suffers extreme torment for a long period. A being who has committed sins in a previous life suffers greatly in Kumbhi hell.

**Verse 7:**

**Text:** *Kandu-su pakkhipp panayati balam, tato-pi daddha pun uppayant. Te uddhakaehi panjamaana, avrehi khajanti sanapphaehi.*

**Translation:** They throw the beings into the Kumbhi hell, which is like a ball, and roast them. Then, they jump up like roasted chickpeas. The **Drona** crows peck at them from above, and when they try to escape, lions and tigers devour them.

**Commentary:** The hell guards throw the unfortunate beings into the Kumbhi hell, which is shaped like a ball, and roast them. Then, they jump up from the roasting place like roasted chickpeas. The **Drona** crows with their crooked bodies peck at them from above. When they try to escape, they are devoured by lions, tigers, and other beasts.

**Verse 8:**

**Text:** *Samusiyam naam vidhumathaanam, jam soyattattakaluunam thananti. Ahosiram katu vigattiuunam, ayamva satthehi samosaventi.*

**Translation:** There is a smokeless fiery place in hell called **Samusiyam**, where the tormented beings cry out in sorrow. The **Paramatma** gods lower their heads and cut their bodies into pieces with iron weapons.

**Commentary:** The **Samusiyam** is a place in hell that resembles a pyre. It is smokeless and fiery. The tormented beings cry out in sorrow when they reach this place. The **Paramatma** gods lower their heads and cut their bodies into pieces with iron weapons.

Page #360:
---------------------------
The **Sri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states that the body is cut into pieces like a piece of cloth with weapons, and they are destroyed piece by piece. (8)

**Commentary:** In hell, there is a place of fire without smoke, like a cremation ground. The word "name" is used here in the sense of possibility. This indicates that there are places of torture in hell. Having attained this smokeless fiery place, the beings of hell are tormented with grief and cry out in sorrow. The hell guardians lower their heads and cut their bodies into pieces with iron weapons.

**Commentary:** In that hell, the beings with their bodies torn apart are hung upside down, and they are eaten by birds with iron beaks. The land of hell is called **Sanjeevani**, because even after suffering death-like pain, the beings do not die there because their lifespan remains. The lifespan of those who go to that hell is very long. The sinful beings are constantly killed and injured there.

**Commentary:** In that hell, the beings are hung upside down from pillars, with their arms above and their heads below, like corpses. Their bodies are torn apart, and their skin is removed. These hanging beings are eaten by crows and vultures with iron beaks. The hell guardians cut them into pieces, or they cut each other into pieces. They are boiled and fainted. Even though they experience extreme pain, they do not die. Therefore, the land of hell is called **Sanjeevani**, like a life-giving medicine, because a being who goes to hell, even if cut into pieces, does not die because his lifespan remains. The lifespan of hell is said to be a maximum of thirty-three oceans. This hell is of long duration. The sinful beings who go there are killed and injured by maces and other weapons. They want to die from the pain of hell, but even after being crushed, they do not die. Their bodies and their pieces merge together like mercury. (332)

## Hellish Torment: A Translation of Jain Text

**Verse 10:**

The denizens of hell are pierced with sharp, fiery spears, like a captured beast. They cry out in pain, their suffering is twofold, both internal and external.

**Commentary:**

The guardians of hell, with their fiery, ethereal spears, pierce the souls of the damned. They are like captured animals, helpless and at the mercy of their tormentors. The damned, though pierced, do not die. They only cry out in anguish, their suffering is unending. They are devoid of joy, both within and without, and experience only pain.

**Verse 11:**

There is a place of torment, always burning, where a fire burns without fuel. The wicked are bound there, their cries echoing, their suffering prolonged.

**Commentary:**

There is a place of torment, always burning, where a fire burns without fuel. This place is vast and terrible. The wicked, bound by their past deeds, are forced to endure this torment. They cry out in anguish, their suffering unending.

Page #362:
---------------------------
In the Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra, those beings who have committed extremely cruel and merciless karmas reside there bound to experience the fruits of their self-created sins. What are these beings like? They cry out loudly, scream and shout. They scream and shout for a long time. 

"Great pyres are kindled, and they throw the sorrowful and compassionate beings into them. The wicked deeds revolve there, like ghee falling into a flame." (12)

Commentary: The hell guardians kindle great pyres and throw the hellish beings, who are sorrowful and compassionate, into them. The wicked beings, having gone into the pyre, dissolve there, just as ghee, falling into a flame, melts. Even though they dissolve, they are not freed from their lives due to the influence of the hell. (12) This is another type of hellish torment.

"There is always a burning place, a place of intense suffering, which is obtained as a result of strong karmas. It is inherently very painful. In that place, the hell guardians bind the hands and feet of the hellish beings and beat them with clubs, as if they were enemies." (13)

Commentary: "Always" means at all times. "Entire" means complete. "Place of Dharma" means a hot place, which is obtained by strong karmas. "Brought about" means caused, very painful Dharma - nature. In that place of torment, they bind the hellish beings by their hands and feet and throw them there. They beat them with clubs, as if they were enemies, in that very state. (13) And...

Page #363:
---------------------------
## Hellish Torment: A Jain Perspective

There exists a place perpetually engulfed in intense heat. This place, a consequence of accumulated karmic debts, is bound by strong chains and inherently agonizing. The hell guardians, devoid of any compassion, bind the tormented souls, who find no refuge, hand and foot, and cast them into this sorrowful abyss. There, they are mercilessly beaten with rods, treated like enemies.

They break the backs of the wretched souls with clubs, and shatter their heads with iron hammers. Their mangled bodies are then sliced open like planks of wood with heated saws.

The hell guardians, driven by cruelty, break the backs of the unfortunate souls with clubs, and crush their heads with iron hammers. The word "api" (also) implies that they also mutilate other limbs. They then carve open the sides of their bodies with saws, and further torment them with heated saws and force them to drink molten lead.

The hell guardians, remembering the wicked deeds of the tormented souls from their past lives, inflict pain upon them with arrows. They drive them like elephants, using goads, forcing them to carry burdens. They force one, two, or three other souls to mount their backs and walk, and in their rage, they strike their vital points.

Page #364:
---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Chapter 15**

The Naraka-palas, driven by the desire to inflict pain, force the Narakas to carry burdens, just as elephants are used to carry loads. They mount them and make them carry burdens, or they make them carry heavy loads, just as elephants carry heavy burdens. This is an example, and the same applies to camels and other animals being used to carry burdens. The text explains how they make them carry burdens: they mount one, two, or three Narakas and make them carry the load. If the Narakas are unable to carry the load due to its weight, the Naraka-palas become angry and beat them with whips and other instruments. They pierce the Narakas' vital points, causing them great pain.

**Chapter 16**

The Naraka-palas, driven by their evil deeds, force the Narakas, who are like helpless children, to walk on slippery, thorny, and vast land. They bind the Narakas, who are unconscious and have lost their senses, and tear their bodies apart, throwing them around like offerings to the city.

**Commentary**

The Naraka-palas force the Narakas, who are like helpless children, to walk on slippery, thorny, and vast land, which is covered in blood and other fluids. They force them to walk quickly, even though they are slow and weak. The Naraka-palas bind the Narakas, who are unconscious and have lost their senses, in various ways. They are driven by their evil deeds and inflict pain on the Narakas by tearing their bodies apart and throwing them around like offerings to the city.

## Hell Division Study - Vetaalie

**Verse 17:**

The Vetaalie, a massive mountain of stone, created by the gods, hangs in the sky, a place of immense suffering. There, the tormented souls of hell, who have committed terrible deeds, are punished for countless muhurtas.

**Commentary:**

The word "name" here signifies possibility. It is possible that in the sky, there exists a mountain called Vetaalie, created by the righteous gods. This mountain is vast, made of a single stone, and is a place of immense suffering and darkness. The souls of hell, unable to touch it, are tormented by it. They are punished for their cruel deeds, committed in countless lifetimes. The word "sahasra" (thousand) signifies a vast amount of time, meaning they are punished for a very long time.

**Verse 18:**

The sinners, bound and tormented, cry out day and night. In the vast and terrible hell, they are killed by the cruel, their necks broken.

**Commentary:**

The sinners, bound and tormented, are those who have committed great sins. They cry out in pain, day and night. The word "kute" signifies a place of suffering. In this vast and terrible hell, the fallen souls are killed by the cruel, their necks broken. The word "hata" signifies that they are killed, and the word "stananti" signifies that they cry out.

Page #366:
---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states that in hell, people are hanged by the neck, beaten with piles of stones, and they can only cry and do nothing. The word "tu" here is indicative of a concept.

**Verse 19:**

* **Original:** भंजंति णं पुव्वमरी सरोसं, समुग्गरे ते मुसले गहेतुं । ते भिन्नदेहा रुहिरं वमंता, ओमुद्धगा धरणितले पडंति ॥१९॥
* **Translation:** The **paramādhāmī** gods, holding maces and pestles, beat the hellish beings with great anger, as if they were their enemies from a previous life. These beings, with their bodies torn apart, vomit blood and fall face down on the ground.

**Commentary:**

* **Original:** 'णम्' इति वाक्यालङ्कारे पुर्वमरय इवारयो जन्मन्तरवैरिण इव परमाधार्मिका यदिवा-जन्मान्तरापकारिणो नारका अपरेषामङ्गानि 'सरोष' सकोपं समुद्राणि मुसलानि गृहीत्वा ‘भञ्जन्ति' गाढप्रहारै रामदयन्ति, ते च नारकास्त्राणरहिताः शस्त्रप्रहारैर्भिन्नदेहा रुधिरमुद्वमन्तोऽधोमुखा धरणितले पतन्तीति ॥१९॥
* **Translation:** The word "ṇam" in this verse is a figure of speech. The **paramādhāmī** gods, considering the hellish beings as their enemies from a previous life, or as those who have wronged them in a previous life, beat them with great anger, using maces, pestles, and other heavy weapons, breaking their limbs. These hellish beings, who have no protection, fall to the ground face down, their bodies torn apart, their heads crushed, and blood flowing from their mouths.

**Verse 20:**

* **Original:** अणासिया नाम महासियाला, पागब्मिणो तत्थ सयायकोवा । खजति तत्था बहुकूरकम्मा, अदूरगा संकलियाहि बद्धा ॥२०॥
* **Translation:** In that hell, there are huge, ferocious, hungry jackals, always angry. They devour the wicked beings who are bound together by chains, close to each other.

**Commentary:**

* **Original:** महादेहप्रमाणा महान्तः-शृगाला नरकपालविकुर्विता 'अनशिता' बुभुक्षिताः, नामशब्दः सम्भावनायां, सम्भाव्यत एतन्नरकेषु, 'अतिप्रगल्भिता' अतिधृष्टा रौद्ररूपा निर्भया: 'तत्र' तेषु नरकेषु सम्भवन्ति 'सदावकोपा' नित्यकुपिताः तैरेवम्भूतैः शृगालादिभिस्तत्र व्यवस्थिता जन्मान्तरकृत बहुक्रूरकर्माणः शृङ्खलादिभिर्बद्धा अयोमयनिगडिता 'अदूरगाः परस्परसमीपवर्तिनो 'भक्षयन्ते' खण्डशः खाद्यन्त इति ॥२०॥
* **Translation:** In that hell, there are huge, hungry, very arrogant, fierce, fearless jackals, created by the **narakapāla** (hell guardians). The word "nāma" in this verse is used to indicate possibility. It is possible that these jackals exist in hell. They are always angry and devour the wicked beings who are bound together by chains, close to each other. These beings have committed many cruel deeds in their previous lives.

Page #367:
---------------------------
Jain Terms Preserved:

The study of the divisions of hell (Naraka-vibhakti adhyayana) indicates that such a possibility exists in hell. The jackals are always enraged, and they continue to eat the sinful Naraka beings who are their neighbors and bound in iron chains from their previous births, who live in that hell.

The river named Sadaajala is an extremely difficult (abhidurgaa), slippery (pavijalana) and molten (loha-viliinatattaa) one. Those who enter into it, the helpless (ekaa-atranuka) Narakas perform a single (egaaya) upward movement (utkramana).

These touches (sparshaah) constantly (nirantaram) afflict the ignorant (baalana) there for a long duration (chira-dvitiiyana). For the one being tormented (na hanyamaanasya), there is no protection (traana), he himself (eko svayam) experiences the suffering (paryanuhhavati duhkham).

Page #368:
---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra with Commentary - Summarizing the Purpose and Showing the Specific Kinds of Suffering

The Sutra-maker, concluding this section, again points out the suffering of the hell-bound beings. The "touches" mentioned in the previous two sections, which are inflicted by the supreme gods, or by the hell-bound beings themselves, or which are naturally experienced, are extremely harsh. They are more unbearable than the forms, tastes, smells, touches, and sounds. They are utterly helpless and constantly torment the hell-bound beings. They do not get a moment's respite, not even for the blink of an eye. These hell-bound beings reside in hell for a long time, as the first hell, called Ratnaprabha, has a maximum duration of a period equal to the ocean. The second hell, called Sharkaraprabha, has a maximum duration of three periods equal to the ocean. The third, Baluka, has seven, the fourth, Panka, has ten, the fifth, Dhumaprabha, has seventeen, the sixth, Tamahprabha, has twenty-two, the seventh, Mahatamahprabha, has thirty-three periods equal to the ocean. In these hell realms, those who have gone there, having attained a superior position due to their past karma, and who are being killed by others, do not receive any help or protection. For it is heard that even Seetaindra, seeing Lakshmana suffering in hell, could not protect him from the torment. Thus, this being, alone, without those for whom he committed the sins, experiences the suffering resulting from his karma. No one shares his suffering. As it is said:

"For the sake of my family, I have committed very heinous sins. I am alone, suffering their consequences, while they, the beneficiaries, have left me."

And further:

"Whatever karma one has done in the past, that same karma one experiences in the future. Having experienced the suffering of existence alone, the suffering beings experience infinite suffering."

Page #369:
---------------------------
## Hell Division Study Translation

**A being receives the fruits of its actions in the next birth. One who has performed actions leading to the solitary, painful hell realm, goes to that endless, sorrowful hell and experiences its fruits.**

**Commentary:**  The actions (karma) that a being performed in a previous birth, whether they were of a low, medium, or high nature, will result in a similar state of being in the next birth. This is to say that the intensity of the karma, whether strong, weak, or moderate, will result in a similar intensity of experience in the next birth.  Those who have performed actions leading to the solitary, painful hell realm, experience endless, unbearable suffering. This suffering is inescapable and cannot be alleviated by anyone.

**Verse 24:**

**These hells, O wise one, should be contemplated. Do not harm any being in the entire world. One who has unwavering faith in the true nature of the soul and is free from attachment, understands the nature of the world and does not fall under its sway.**

**Commentary:**  Having heard about these hells, the wise person should not harm any being in the world.  One who has unwavering faith in the true nature of the soul and is free from attachment, understands the nature of the world and does not fall under its sway.  This means that one should not be swayed by the desires of the world and should not be attached to material possessions.  One should also avoid false speech, stealing, and sexual misconduct.  One should understand the nature of the world, which is full of suffering, and should not be attached to it.

**Commentary:**  The author of the sutra, in concluding this section, emphasizes that one should contemplate the hells and the suffering that they entail.  One should also avoid harming any being in the world and should strive to live a life of non-attachment.

Page #370:
---------------------------
The author of the Sutra-Kritanga Sutra, while guiding us, says that one should not harm any living being, be it a mobile or immobile creature, or any other kind of being. One should remain steadfast in the principles of soul, etc., and maintain a firm, unwavering, and right vision. One should renounce attachment, which people accumulate for the sake of happiness. One should understand the nature of those who commit evil deeds or experience the fruits of evil deeds, or the nature of passions, and not be under their control. The word "Tu" in the verse, or the elements of beginning and end, or the act of taking, also imply the abandonment of false speech, giving without receiving, and non-chastity.

Thus, in the realm of animals, humans, and gods, the endless consequences of actions follow. Knowing all this, one should strive to live a life of righteousness.

Translation: It is said that a sinner goes to hell. Similarly, one should understand the consequences of actions in the realms of animals, humans, and gods. In this endless cycle of four realms, one receives the fruits of one's actions. Therefore, a wise person, understanding this, should practice restraint throughout life.

Commentary: The phrase "Evam" etc. means that those who commit evil deeds, even in the realms of animals, humans, and gods, experience the endless consequences of their actions in the four realms. A wise person, knowing all this, should strive to live a life of righteousness, and should look forward to the time of death. This means that those who are caught in the cycle of the four realms experience only suffering. Therefore, a wise person should remain engaged in the practice of liberation and restraint throughout life. The word "iti" indicates the end, and "bravimi" is as before.

Commentary Meaning: To express that the specific sufferings discussed earlier also occur elsewhere, the author of the Sutra says:

Those who commit evil deeds experience the consequences of their actions in the realms of animals, humans, and gods, in the form of endless karmic consequences in the four realms. A wise person, knowing all this, should follow the path of restraint and look forward to the time of death. This means that those who are caught in the cycle of the four realms experience only suffering. Therefore, a wise person should remain engaged in the practice of liberation and restraint throughout life. The word "iti" indicates the end, and "bravimi" is as before.

The fifth study, called "Naraka Vibhakti," is now complete.

This is the Sutra of the Sri Sutra Kritanga. Who is that man who has described the true nature of things, the unique and unparalleled Dharma, which is beneficial for all, in a definitive or impartial way, and who is able to support and sustain beings who have fallen into the lower realms?

How was his knowledge, how was his vision, how was his conduct, the son of the knowers? You know, monk, tell me truthfully, as you have heard, as you have seen, as you have understood.

Translation: How was the knowledge, vision, and conduct of the Lord Mahavira, who was born into a noble family? You know this, monk. Tell us as you have heard, seen, and understood.

Commentary: How did the Lord attain knowledge? What was the nature of his knowledge, which revealed the special meaning? What was the nature of his vision, which encompassed the general meaning? What was his conduct, in the form of the Yamas and Niyamas? The knowers - the Kshatriyas - were his sons. The Lord Viravardhamana Swami was their son. He was. This is what I have asked. "Monk!" O Sudharma Swami, you know this, you understand it completely. This is a figure of speech. You have heard all this, you have understood it as it is, as you have seen it, tell me all this.

He was asked this, and Sudharma Swami began to describe the qualities of the Lord Mahavira.

Commentary: The Lord asks a question to understand the qualities of the Lord Mahavira. He asks how he attained knowledge, or what was the nature of his knowledge, which revealed the special meaning, and what was the nature of his vision, which encompassed the general meaning. What was his conduct, in the form of the Yamas and Niyamas? How were all these qualities of the Lord Mahavira, who was born into a noble Kshatriya family? O Lord Sudharma Swami! You know all this well. Here, the word "nam" is used in the sense of a figure of speech. Accordingly, tell me what you have heard, what you have understood, what you have seen - what you have experienced.

He who knows the suffering of the world, who is skilled in the destruction of the eight karmas, who is omniscient and all-seeing, who is glorious and stands in the path of the eyes of the world, know his Dharma and contemplate it with steadfastness.

Translation: Sri Sudharma Swami, Jambuswami, and others say to their followers: The Lord Mahavira knew the suffering of all beings in the world - he knew the essence of non-violence. He was skilled in the destruction of the eight karmas. He was always wise and useful everywhere. He was the possessor of infinite knowledge and infinite vision. He was glorious and stood in the path of the eyes of the world. He was the eyes of the world. Know the Dharma taught by the Lord Mahavira and contemplate it with steadfastness - mental stability.

The study of the Veeraththu commentary - The Lord is endowed with thirty-four atiśayas. He knows the suffering caused by the karmic consequences of living beings in the world, hence he is known as Kheda-jña (knower of suffering). He is capable of removing suffering by giving teachings. Or, if 'Kshetra-jña' means 'knower of the self' due to the knowledge of the true nature of the self, or if 'Kshetra' means 'space', then he is Kshetra-jña because he knows the nature of the world and the non-world. He is called 'Kushala' because he destroys the eight types of karmic forms called 'Bhavakushas'. He is skilled in destroying the karma of living beings. He is 'Aashu-prajña' because his wisdom is swift. He is always useful everywhere. He does not know by thinking like a 'Chhadma-stha' (pretender). Sometimes the reading is 'Maharshi'. He is a great sage because he is a great sage due to his intense penance and his endurance of countless hardships and afflictions. He is 'Ananta-jñani' because his knowledge is infinite, indestructible, and encompasses all things, or because it is the special recipient of knowledge. He is 'Ananta-darshi' because he is the determiner of general meaning. Such a Lord is 'Yashasvi' because his fame surpasses that of humans, gods, and demons. He is the 'Chakshu-pathe' (eye path) of the world, because he is in the state of 'Bhavastha-kevali'. He is the eye of the world because he reveals the subtle and obstructed objects of the world. Know the nature of the Dharma that liberates from the world, which is taught by him. Know the Dharma called 'Shruta-charitra' which is taught by him. See the 'Dhriti' (steadfastness) of the Lord, which is unwavering and unmoving even when afflicted by afflictions. See the 'Rati' (delight) in restraint, which is taught by him. Consider it with your sharp and intelligent mind. Or, the Shramanas and others asked Sudharmaswami, "Do you know the Dharma of the Lord, who is glorious and the eye of the world, and his steadfast and intense restraint-filled life? If so, tell us."

Thus, Sudharmaswami begins to describe his qualities.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Verse 4:**

**"In the upward, downward, and horizontal directions, in all the directions, those who tremble, those who are stationary, and those who are living beings, the wise one, considering them as both eternal and non-eternal, like a lamp, illuminates the Dharma, the right path."**

**Translation:**

The wise one, the omniscient Lord Mahavira, considered all beings, those who tremble (mobile beings), those who are stationary (immobile beings), and those who are living beings, in all directions, both in the upward, downward, and horizontal directions, as both eternal and non-eternal. Like a lamp, he illuminated the Dharma, the right path, for all beings.

**Commentary:**

In this verse, the Sutra Kritanga Sutra describes the omniscience of Lord Mahavira and his ability to see the true nature of all beings. He understands that all beings are both eternal and non-eternal, and he uses this knowledge to illuminate the Dharma, the right path, for all beings.

The commentary explains that the "trembling" beings are those who have a body and can move, while the "stationary" beings are those who are rooted in the earth, such as plants. The "living beings" are all those who have life, including both mobile and immobile beings.

The commentary also explains that Lord Mahavira's knowledge is like a lamp, illuminating the Dharma for all beings. This means that his knowledge is not limited to a select few, but is available to all who are willing to learn.

The commentary concludes by stating that Lord Mahavira's purpose in illuminating the Dharma is not to gain praise or honor, but to benefit all beings. He is a true compassionate being who wants to help all beings achieve liberation from suffering.

The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra. He is the one who has attained the highest knowledge, the one who is free from attachments, the one who is patient, the one who has infinite vision. He shines like the sun, he illuminates like the fire of Vaishravana. ||6|| 
Commentary - The Bhagavan Mahavira is the one who has attained the highest knowledge, the one who is free from attachments, the one who is patient, the one who has infinite vision. He shines like the sun, he illuminates like the fire of Vaishravana. 
Explanation - The word "Bhuta" is used in the sense of growth, auspiciousness, and protection. Therefore, "Bhuta-prajna" means one who has attained the highest knowledge, one who has infinite knowledge. Thus, "Bhuta-prajna" means one who has attained the highest knowledge, one who is the protector of the world, and one who is the source of all auspiciousness. Similarly, "Aniyata" means unattached, free from attachments. Therefore, "Aniyata-chari" means one who is free from attachments, one who is free to move about as he pleases. Similarly, "Oghantara" means one who has crossed the ocean of samsara, the ocean of worldly existence. Similarly, "Dhira" means one who is wise, one who is patient, one who is able to endure hardship. Similarly, "Ananta-chakshu" means one who has infinite vision, one who has the knowledge of all things, one who is the light of the world. Similarly, just as the sun shines most brightly, just as there is no one who shines more brightly than the sun, so too the Bhagavan is the most knowledgeable. Similarly, just as the fire of Vaishravana, the fire of Indra, illuminates the darkness, so too the Bhagavan illuminates the darkness of ignorance and reveals the true nature of things. ||6||

## Thui Adhyay

**Translation:**

This study (Thui Adhyay)

**Translation of Ashuprajna:** The swift-minded, Kashyap gotra-born, Lord Mahavira, the leader of the supreme Dharma (religion) established by Lord Rishabha and other Tirthankaras, is the preacher in the present age. Just as Indra is the best among all the gods in the Devaloka (heaven), similarly, Lord Mahavira is the best in this world.

**Commentary:**

There is no other, superior Dharma than this, which is related to the Tirthankaras, starting with Rishabha, established by this Muni (sage), the glorious Vardhamana, who is born in the Kashyap gotra, is Ashuprajna (swift-minded), Kevalajnani (omniscient), possessing divine knowledge, and a leader. This is indicated by the sixth case ending in "na" (e.g., "loka-avyaya-nistha" - not attached to worldly things) in the sutra (aphorism) "na loka-avyaya-nistha khalartha-trinanam" (P. 2-3-69). Therefore, the second case ending in "am" is used for "dharma" (religion). Similarly, Indra is the "mahanubhava" (great and powerful) in the "divi" (heaven) among thousands of gods. The word "neta" (leader) is used here in the sense of "pranayaka" (guide) and is distinguished by his form, strength, color, etc., and is the most important. Similarly, the Lord is also distinguished from all, is the guide, and is great and powerful. ||7|| Further,

**Commentary Meaning:**

The omniscient, born in the Kashyap gotra, Lord Mahavira is the leader of the supreme Dharma, which is unmatched and established by Lord Rishabha and other Tirthankaras. He is the preacher in the present age. Here, the word "neta" (leader) has the suffix "trna" which indicates "taachchheelya" (excellence). Therefore, due to the prohibition of the sixth case ending in "na" by the sutra "na loka-avyaya-nistha khalartha-trinanam" (not attached to worldly things), the second case ending in "am" is used for "dharma" (religion).

Just as Indra is the "mahanubhava" (great and powerful) among thousands of gods in the heaven, is the leader of all, and is the most important in terms of form, strength, color, etc., similarly, Lord Mahavira is the best, the leader of all, and the most powerful. Here, the word "nam" is used in the "vakyalankara" (figure of speech), which should be known.

**Verse 8:**

Just as the ocean is inexhaustible, similarly, the Lord is the possessor of inexhaustible, imperishable knowledge. His knowledge is vast like the self-born, beautiful ocean. Just as the water of that ocean is pure, similarly, the knowledge of Lord Mahavira is pure and free from impurities. The Lord is free from the "kashayas" (passions). He is like Indra, the king of gods, and is very glorious.

**Commentary:**

This Lord is known as "prajna" (knowledge). His knowledge is "akshaya" (inexhaustible) and his knowledge is not diminished or destroyed. His knowledge is "kevalajnana" (omniscient), which is infinite in terms of time, space, and substance. Due to the lack of a suitable example, it is said that his knowledge is like the "sagar" (ocean). Since the ocean is vast, deep, and undisturbed, similarly, the Lord's knowledge is vast, deep, and undisturbed. Just as the ocean is "anavila" (pure) and has pure water, similarly, the Lord's knowledge is pure and free from impurities. The "kashayas" (passions) are present in those who are "kashayin" (passionate), but the Lord is not "kashayin" (passionate) but is "akashayin" (free from passions). He is free from the "karma-bandhana" (bondage of karma) like "jnana-avaran" (veil of knowledge). The word "bhikshu" (mendicant) is used in some texts. Its meaning is: Even though he is free from all obstacles, is worthy of worship by all, and lives only on alms, he is still a "bhikshu" (mendicant). He does not live on the wealth obtained from fire sacrifices, etc. Similarly, he is like "shakra" (Indra), the king of gods, and is "dyutiman" (glorious). ||8|| Further,

##  Sri Sutra Kritanga Sutra Tikaarth - 

**Knowledge (Prajna) is that by which objects are known. Bhagwan Mahavira is inexhaustible in terms of knowledge. The object that is knowable, in that, Bhagwan's intellect does not experience decay, is not obstructed, and is not blocked by anyone. The name of their intellect is only knowledge - omniscience (Sarvjna). That only knowledge is, in terms of time, infinite and without end, including the past, present, and future. In terms of substance, space, and emotion, it is infinite. There is no example of its equality or equivalence in its entirety. There is no object that is completely equal to it, by which it can be compared. The Sutrakar gives a local, partial example. Just as the ocean is filled with inexhaustible water, in the same way, Bhagwan is filled with inexhaustible knowledge. The word "ocean" refers to the ordinary sea. Therefore, its qualifier - a particular ocean - is discussed. Just as the ocean called "Swayambhu Raman" is vast, deep, filled with very deep water, and unshakable, in the same way, Bhagwan Mahavira's knowledge is also vast and infinitely deeper than the ocean "Swayambhu Raman", and unshakable. Just as the water of "Swayambhu Raman" is pure and clear, in the same way, Bhagwan's knowledge is also pure and free from any impurities due to the absence of even a trace of karma. Those who have passions are called "Kasai" or "Kasayavan". But Bhagwan was free from passions. Therefore, they were "Akasai". Their knowledge-related karma, like "Jnanavarniya", was destroyed, therefore they were liberated. Somewhere, "Bhikkhu" - "Bhikshu" is found in the text. Its meaning is that all the obstacles and hindrances of Bhagwan were destroyed. They were worthy of worship by the entire world. Even though they were like this, they earned their livelihood through begging. They were capable of obtaining inexhaustible wealth, food, etc., but they did not use the power of "Labdhi-Yog Vibhuti". Bhagwan was the lord of the gods, like Indra, and was "Deetiman" - "Deetiman".**

"Pratipurna Veeryah", and "Sudarsana" - like Mount Sumeru, the navel of Jambudvipa, just as he is the best of all mountains, so Bhagwan is also the best in terms of strength and other qualities. Just as "Suralaya" - heaven, is the "Mudakara" - joy-giving, for its inhabitants, with qualities like beautiful color, taste, smell, touch, and radiance, "Virajate" - shines, so Bhagwan also shines with many qualities. Or, just as the heaven of the gods is "Mudakara" - joy-giving, with many qualities, so he also shines, and so is Mount Sumeru.**

---------------------------
The study of the Vira-ththu is the best among all the mountains, just as Lord Mahavira is the best in terms of strength, self-power, and unparalleled qualities. Heaven, where the gods reside, is joyful for them. It is adorned with excellent color, taste, smell, touch, and effect, just as the Lord is adorned with many qualities. Or, just as heaven is pleasant and adorned with many qualities, so is Mount Sumeru. Describing the Mount Sumeru mentioned in the example again, it is said:

**Verse 10**

* **Sanskrit:** सयं सहस्साण उ जोयणाणं, तिकंडगे पंडगवेजयंते । से जोयणे णवणवते सहस्से, उद्धस्सितो हेट्ठ सहस्समेगं ॥१०॥
* **English:**  Mount Sumeru is one hundred thousand yojanas high. It has three divisions. The Pandaka forest, situated on its highest part, is adorned like the Vaidyanti flag, and is high. That Mount Sumeru is ninety-nine thousand yojanas high and one thousand yojanas deep in the earth.

**Commentary:**

* **Sanskrit:** टीका - स मेरुयोजनसहस्त्राणां शतमुच्चस्त्वेन, तथा त्रीणि कण्डान्यस्येति त्रिकण्डः, तद्यथा-भौम जाम्बूनदं वैडूर्यमिति, पुनरप्यसावेव विशेष्यते-'पण्डकवैजयन्त' इति पण्डकवनं शिरसि व्यवस्थितं वैजयन्तीकल्पंपताकाभूतं यस्य स तथा, तथाऽसावूर्ध्वमुच्छ्रि तो नवनवतिर्योजनसहस्त्राण्यधोऽपि सहस्त्रमेकमवगाढ इति ॥१०॥
* **English:**  Mount Sumeru is one hundred thousand yojanas high, and it has three divisions: (1) Earth, (2) Gold, and (3) Lapis Lazuli. Again, describing the Mount Sumeru, it is said that the Pandaka forest, situated on the top of Mount Sumeru, is adorned like a flag. Mount Sumeru is ninety-nine thousand yojanas high and one thousand yojanas deep in the earth.

**Verse 11**

* **Sanskrit:** पुढे णभे चिट्टइ भूमिवहिए, जं सूरिया अणुपरिवट्टयंति । से हेमवन्ने बहुनंदणे य, जंसी रतिं वेदयंती महिंदा ॥११॥
* **English:**  That Mount Sumeru touches the sky and is embedded in the earth. The Sun and the stars revolve around it. It is golden in color and has many Nandana forests. The great Indra, endowed with great wealth, enjoys pleasure there.

**Commentary:**

* **Sanskrit:** टीका - 'नभसि' 'स्पष्टो' लग्नो नभो व्याप्य तिष्ठति तथा भूमिं चावगाह्य स्थित इति ऊर्ध्वाधस्तिर्यग्लोक संस्पर्शी, तथा 'यं' मेरुं 'सूर्या' आदित्या ज्योतिष्का 'अनुपरिवर्त्तयन्ति' यस्य पार्श्वतो भ्रमन्तीत्यर्थः, तथाऽसौ
* **English:**  It touches the sky and is embedded in the earth, thus touching the sky, earth, and all directions. The Sun and the stars revolve around it, meaning they revolve around it.

Page #380:
---------------------------
The **Sri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states: "He who has four **Nandanavana** forests is called **Bahunandanavana**. These forests are as follows: (1) **Bhadrashala** forest on the earth, (2) **Nanda** forest in the **Mekhala** region, five hundred yojanas above it, (3) **Saumanasa** forest, sixty-two thousand five hundred yojanas above it, and (4) **Panduka** forest on the peak, thirty-six thousand yojanas above it. Thus, this **Meru** mountain is adorned with four **Nandanavana** forests and is a place of diverse and wonderful games. Even the **Mahendras**, attracted by its beauty, come here from the abode of the gods and enjoy the pleasures of love and play." ||11||

Furthermore, the commentary states: "This **Meru** mountain touches the sky, is connected to it, and is deeply rooted in the earth. It touches the upper, lower, and intermediate realms. The sun, planets, stars, etc., revolve around this mountain. It is yellow in color, like heated gold. On top of it are four **Nandanavana** forests. They are as follows: (1) **Bhadrashala** forest in the earthly region, (2) **Nanda** forest in the **Mekhala** region, five hundred yojanas above it, (3) **Saumanasa** forest, sixty-two thousand five hundred yojanas above it, and (4) **Panduka** forest on the peak, thirty-six thousand yojanas above it. Thus, this **Meru** mountain is adorned with four **Nandanavana** forests and is a place of diverse and wonderful games. The **Mahendras**, attracted by its beauty, come here from the abode of the gods and enjoy the pleasures of love and play."

"This mountain, known by many names, shines brightly like polished gold. It is the highest of all mountains, inaccessible and difficult to climb. It is adorned with jewels, gems, and medicinal herbs, making it appear like a blazing land." ||12||

The commentary states: "This mountain, known as **Meru**, **Mandara**, **Sudarshana**, **Suragiri**, etc., is famous and renowned. Its color is smooth and pure, like gold. There is no other mountain in the world that is higher than this. It is inaccessible due to its slopes, peaks, and surrounding mountains. It is difficult for ordinary beings to climb. This great mountain, adorned with jewels, gems, and medicinal herbs, appears like a blazing land." ||12||

The mountain king, Meru, is situated in the middle of the earth, shining with the brilliance of the sun. He is adorned with many colors and is pleasing to the mind. He illuminates all directions like the sun.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Verse 14:**

The son of the Kshatriyas, Sri Manmahavirvardhamanaswami, is the meaning. He is the best - the chief - among all beings by birth, by fame among all the famous, by knowledge and insight among all those with knowledge and insight, and by conduct among all those with good conduct. The formation of the word is to be done by making a compound of birth etc., with the suffix "ac" from the sutra "Arshaadi tvad" etc., due to the exaggeration of the dual compound.

**Verse 15:**

Just as Nishadha is the best among the long and extended mountains, and Ruchak is the best among the circular mountains, so too, in the world, among all the monks, they say that the wise ones call him, the one who has attained the supreme knowledge, the best.

**Verse 16:**

He has attained the supreme Dharma, he has seen the supreme state of meditation. He is pure, very pure, perfectly pure, pure like a conch shell, pure like a single point.

Page #383:
---------------------------
## Thui Adhy

**The Great Lord Mahavira, having expounded the unsurpassed, supreme Dharma, was meditating on the unsurpassed, supreme meditation.**

His meditation was pure, free from any blemish, like the purest white substance. It was solitary, pure, and white, like a conch shell and the moon.

**He meditates.**

**Pure, white, free from blemish, white, solitary, pure, and white like a conch shell and the moon.**

**Commentary:**

There is no other Dharma superior to this, hence it is called the unsurpassed Dharma. Having expounded this supreme Dharma, the Great Lord Mahavira was meditating on the supreme meditation. Indeed, the Great Lord, having attained knowledge, was meditating on the third aspect of white meditation, called *sukshmakriya-pratipata*, while restraining the subtle body yoga in the state of *yoga-nirodha*. When the yogas were restrained, he was engaged in the fourth aspect of white meditation, called *vyupara-kriya-nivritta*. This is what is being shown: the meditation is pure, like the purest white substance, free from blemish, free from impurities, pure, like pure gold, or like the foam of water, which is pure and free from impurities. It is solitary, pure, and white, like a conch shell and the moon. The Great Lord Mahavira was meditating on the two aspects of the unsurpassed meditation.

## Chhaya

**The Great Sage, the supreme, having purified all karmas, attained the supreme liberation, which has a beginning but no end, through knowledge, conduct, and insight.**

**Commentary:**

The Great Lord, after attaining the fourth aspect of white meditation, which is established in the state of *shaileshya*, attained the fifth state, the state of liberation. The commentary explains the state of liberation: It is unsurpassed, because it is supreme and because it is the highest state in the world. It is the supreme, because it is the primary state. The Great Sage, because his body was purified by intense austerities, purified all karmas, including the *jnana-avaran* (veil of knowledge), through his unique knowledge, insight, and conduct, and attained the state of liberation, which is characterized by destruction.

Again, the commentary praises the Great Lord through an example:

**355**

Page #384:
---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Commentary:**

The Lord Mahavira, in the fourth stage of white meditation, which arises in the state of Shaileshi, attained the self-sufficient, perfected state of Siddha-Gati. This state has a beginning but no end. The meaning of having no end is that once attained, Siddha-Gati is never lost. Describing the characteristics of this Siddha-Gati, the Sutrakar says - it is the best, the most excellent. It is at the forefront of the Aggra Lok, hence it is the most advanced. Lord Mahavira attained this supreme state. Through intense austerity, he purified his body and destroyed all karmas, including the knowledge-obscuring karma, through the unique knowledge, perception, and conduct of Kshayika. He thus attained Siddhatva. The Sutrakar further describes the praise of the Lord through an example:

**Om Om Om**

**Verse 18:**

* **Sanskrit:** रुक्खेसुणाते जह सामली वा, जस्सिं रतिं वेययती सुवन्ना । वणेसु वा णंदणमाहु सेठ्ठे, नाणेण सीलेण य भूतिपन्ने ॥ १८ ॥
* **Romanized:** Rukkhēsunāte jah sāmalī vā, jassiṁ ratiṁ veyayatī suvanna. Vaṇēsu vā ṇandaṇamāhu sēṭṭhē, nāṇeṇa sīlena ya bhūtipanne. || 18 ||
* **Translation:** Just as the Salmali tree is renowned and excellent among trees, where the Suparna, the special deities of the Bhavanapati class, come and engage in love-play, and just as the Nandan forest is considered the best among forests, similarly, Lord Mahavira is the best in knowledge and conduct, being a Bhuti-Prajna, a great sage.

**Commentary:**

Just as the Salmali tree, situated in the Devakuru, is renowned and excellent among trees, being a place for the Bhavanapati deities to play, where other Suparna, special Bhavanapati deities, come and experience love-play, and just as the Nandan forest is the main, excellent place for the play of the deities among forests, similarly, the Lord is the best due to his Kevala knowledge, which reveals all objects, and his conduct, as described. He is a Bhuti-Prajna, a sage with profound knowledge.

**Om Om Om**

**Verse 19:**

* **Sanskrit:** थणियं व सद्दाण अणुत्तरे उ, चंदो व ताराण महाणुभावे । गंधेसु वा चंदण माहु सेट्ठ, एवं मुणीणं अपडिन्नमाहु ॥ १९ ॥
* **Romanized:** Thaṇiyaṁ va saddāṇa aṇuttare u, chando va tārāṇa mahāṇubhāve. Gandhēsu vā chandaṇa māhu sēṭṭha, evaṁ muṇīṇaṁ apaḍinnaṁ āhu. || 19 ||
* **Translation:** Just as the roar of the thundercloud is the best among all sounds, and the moon is the most prominent among all stars, and sandalwood is considered the best among all fragrances, similarly, Lord Mahavira, the dispassionate and detached, is the best among all sages.

**Commentary:**

Just as the roar of the thundercloud is the best among all sounds, and the moon is the most prominent among all stars, and sandalwood is considered the best among all fragrances, similarly, Lord Mahavira, the dispassionate and detached, is the best among all sages.

**356**

## Translation:

**Verse 19:**

Just as 'stanitam' (thunder) is the most prominent among all sounds, and 'tu' (here) is a word that can be used as an adjective or a conjunction, and just as the moon is the most radiant among all stars, illuminating and delighting all beings, and just as 'chandana' (sandalwood) is considered the best among all fragrant substances, whether it be the 'goshirsha' variety or the 'malaya' variety, similarly, among all 'munis' (great sages), Bhagavan (Lord) Mahavira is the best, for there is no vow (pratijna) that can be taken in this world or the next that can equal his greatness.

**Verse 20:**

Just as the 'svayambhu' (self-born) Raman ocean is the best among all oceans, and Dharanendra is the best among all Nagas (serpent kings), and the Ikshu-rasodaka (sugarcane juice) ocean is the best among all sweet waters, similarly, Bhagavan Mahavira is the best among all those who practice austerities (tapas).

**Verse 21:**

Just as Eravana is the best among elephants, and the lion is the best among deer, and the Ganga is the best among rivers, and Garuda is the best among birds, similarly, among all those who preach liberation (nirvana), the Nayaputta (son of the leader) is the best.

Page #386:
---------------------------
**Verse 1**

**Shadow:** Among elephants, they call Airavata, among lions, the beasts, among waters, the Ganga, among birds, Garuda, the son of Vinudeva, among those who speak of Nirvana, here, the well-known son.

**Translation:** Just as Airavata is known, famous, or the main example among elephants, just as the lion is the main among beasts, just as the Ganga is the main among waters, and just as Garuda, the son of Vinudeva, is the main among birds, in the same way, among all those who speak of Nirvana, among those who are seekers of liberation, the Lord Mahavira is the famous and the best.

**Commentary:** Just as Airavata, the vehicle of Indra, is known, famous, or the main example among elephants, just as the lion, Kesari, is the main among beasts, just as the Ganga is the main among waters, and just as Garuda, the son of Vinudeva, is the main among birds, in the same way, among those who speak of Nirvana, among those who are seekers of liberation, the Lord Mahavira is the famous and the best.

**Verse 2**

**Shadow:** Among warriors, they call Vishvasena, among flowers, they call the lotus. Among Kshatriyas, they call Dantavakya, among sages, they call Vardhamana.

**Translation:** Just as Vishvasena is the main among warriors, just as the lotus is called the best among flowers, just as Dantavakya is the main among Kshatriyas, in the same way, the Lord Vardhamana is the best among sages.

**Commentary:** Just as Vishvasena, the one who has an army of elephants, horses, chariots, and foot soldiers, is the main among warriors, just as the lotus is the main among flowers, just as Dantavakya, the one whose words pacify enemies, is the best among Kshatriyas, in the same way, the Lord Vardhamana is the best among sages.

Page #387:
---------------------------
The heroes who protect beings from destruction are called Kshatriyas. Among those Kshatriyas, the one with the powerful words, the Chakravarti, is the chief, whose words subdue the enemies. In this way, the Sutrakar, presenting many excellent examples, taking the name of the Lord in the form of an example, explains that in the same way, among the Rishis, the glorious, supremely powerful, Sri Vardhaman Swami is the best.

"Among donations, the gift of fearlessness is the best, and among truths, they say, the impeccable is the best. Among austerities, celibacy is the best, and among the people of the world, the Shraman, Jnatputra, is the best." (23)

Commentary: Thus, donation is of many kinds, given for the benefit of oneself and others. Among them, the gift of fearlessness is the best, because it protects the lives of beings. It is said:

"Even if one is dying, one should give a crore of lives, but one should not take a crore of wealth, for everyone wants to live." (1)

Thus, the meaning is easily understood through the example of Gopala's wife and others. Therefore, this story about the importance of the gift of fearlessness is told. In the city of Vasantpura, there was a king named Aridaman. Once, he was sitting in a window with his four wives, playing. At that time, a thief, with a garland of skulls made of red bone, wearing red clothes, smeared with red sandalwood, and carrying a broken pot, was being taken along the royal road by his wife. Seeing him, the wives asked, "What has this man done?" One of the king's men informed them that he had been caught stealing someone else's property, which was against the king's law. Then, one of the wives told the king, "The boon that you granted me earlier, let it be given now, so that I can do something for this man." The king agreed. Then, she had the thief bathed, adorned with ornaments, and given a thousand dinars, and for five days, she provided him with various pleasures, such as music and other things. Then, the second wife did the same for the second day, giving him a hundred thousand dinars. Then, the third wife honored him for the third day, giving him a crore of dinars. The fourth wife, with the king's permission, protected him from death by giving him fearlessness. Then, the other wives laughed at her, saying, "You haven't given him anything." Thus, there was a dispute among them about who had done the most for him. The king called the thief and asked him, "Who has done you the greatest favor?" The thief replied, "I, who was terrified of death, have not enjoyed any pleasure like bathing, etc." He said, "By hearing the gift of fearlessness, I feel as if I have been reborn. Therefore, the gift of fearlessness is the best of all gifts."

Similarly, among words, the one that is "impeccable," free from sin, and does not cause harm to others, is considered the best. Not the truth that causes harm to others. Truth that is beneficial and free from fear is considered good. It is said:

"In the world, it is heard that Kaushika fell into hell with intense suffering because of the truth that was accompanied by killing." (1)

And also:

"Similarly, a blind person should not tell a blind person, a lame person should not tell a lame person, or a sick person should not tell a sick person. Therefore, one should not speak falsely." (1)

Just as celibacy, which is accompanied by the nine types of Brahma-protection, is the best among austerities, so too, the Shraman, Jnatputra, is the best among all the people of the world, with his supreme wealth, all-pervading power, knowledge of destruction, vision, and conduct. (23)

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Commentary:**  What is given to a needy person or a petitioner for the benefit of oneself and others is called charity. Charity is of many kinds.  Abhaya-dana (gift of fearlessness) is the best because it saves the lives of living beings who desire life. It is said that if a dying person is offered a choice between crores of rupees and life, he will choose life, because all beings in the world have an inherent desire to live.  To explain this, an example is given using cowherds and women, as they understand things quickly. Therefore, to illustrate the superiority of Abhaya-dana, a story is presented here:

There was a city called Basantpur.  Aridaman was the king there. He was sitting in a window with his four queens, enjoying himself.  Then he saw a thief.  He was wearing a garland of red oleander flowers around his neck. He was wearing red clothes, and his body was smeared with red sandalwood.  Behind him, a Dindibha drum was being played, signifying his death sentence.  The Chandala people were taking him along the royal road.  The king, along with his queens, saw the thief.  The queens asked him what crime he had committed.  Then a royal official told them that he had stolen the property of another, which is against the king's order.  Hearing this, one of the queens requested the king, "You had promised me a boon earlier, please grant it today, so that I can do some good for this thief, help him."  The king agreed to the queen's request.  That queen had the thief bathed, adorned him with fine ornaments, and spent a thousand gold coins to provide him with the enjoyment of the five senses for a day.  Then the next day, the second queen spent a lakh gold coins to provide him with all kinds of pleasures and comforts.  The third queen spent a crore gold coins on the third day to provide him with all kinds of happiness, joy, and respect.  The fourth queen, having received the king's order, protected him from death.  She gave him Abhaya-dana.  Then the three queens began to mock the fourth queen, saying, "She didn't even give him anything."  The fourth queen said, "I have done the greatest favor to him.  I have given him life."  Thus, a dispute arose among the queens about who had done the greatest favor to the thief.  Then the king called the thief and asked him, "Who has done you the greatest favor?"  Hearing this, the thief said, "I was extremely afraid of the fear of death.  Therefore, I could not experience the pleasures of bathing, etc.  But when I heard the sound that I had been given Abhaya-dana, I felt as if I had been reborn.  Therefore, Abhaya-dana is the best of all charities."  This is true.  Among truthful statements, the statement that does not cause pain to others is considered the best.  But that which causes pain to others is not truly truthful, because truth is that which is beneficial to good people.  It is said in the world that Kaushik Muni, by speaking a truth mixed with violence, fell into a severe, painful hell.  It is also said that one should not call a blind person blind, a eunuch a eunuch, or a thief a thief.  In austerity, celibacy with nine secrets is the best.  Similarly, in wealth, power, knowledge, vision, and conduct, the Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira is the best.

The study of the heroes. The five Anuttara Vimana-dwelling gods are the best among those who have attained the state of liberation, just as the Sudharma Sabha is the best among all assemblies, and just as Nirvana is the best among all Dharmas, so too is the Jina, the son of the Knower, the best among all knowers. ||24||

Commentary: Just as the five Anuttara Vimana-dwelling gods are the best among those who have attained the state of liberation, because they have seven lavas of lifespan remaining before they attain Siddhi, so too is the Sudharma Sabha the best among all assemblies, because it has many places for play. Just as all Dharmas are the best because they lead to liberation, even those who speak ill of the Dharma ultimately point to liberation as the fruit of their own vision, so too is there no other knowledge greater than that of the Jina, the son of the Knower, the omniscient Vira Vardhamana. The Jina is the most knowledgeable, and his knowledge surpasses all other knowledge. ||24||

The one who has overcome greed, destroys the karmas, and does not associate with the wicked. He has crossed the ocean of the great cycle of births and deaths, the fearless hero with infinite vision. ||25||

Commentary: Just as the earth is the foundation of all beings, so too is the Jina the foundation of all beings, because he gives fearlessness and good advice. Or, just as the earth bears all things, so too does the Jina bear all the afflictions and temptations. He destroys the karmas, because he is free from greed and attachment. He is quick-witted and has the sharpest intellect. He is free from the contact of anger and other passions. He has crossed the ocean of the endless cycle of births and deaths, and attained liberation. He is fearless and gives fearlessness to all beings. He is a hero, a man of great strength, and he has infinite knowledge. ||25||

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Chapter 25**

This verse explains the eight types of karma that are abandoned (**apnayatyashtprakaram karmeti sesha**). It also describes the characteristics of the liberated soul:

* **Vigatagriddi:** One who is free from greed (**gaddharyam abhilasho yasya sa vigatagriddi**).
* **Sannividhi:** One who is free from attachment (**sannihidhanam sanniidhi**). This includes both material attachment (**dravya sanniidhi**), such as wealth, possessions, animals, etc., and mental attachment (**bhavasanniidhi**), such as attachment to emotions like anger, delusion, etc. The liberated soul does not engage in either type of attachment (**tamu bhayaraapam api sanniidhi na karoti bhagavan**).
* **Ashu prajna:** One who is quick-witted and has immediate knowledge (**sarvatra sadop yogat na chhadmasthavan manasa paryalochya padartha parichchitti vidhatte**). They do not need to ponder or analyze things like those who are ignorant (**chhadmastha**).
* **Mahabhavoudha:** One who has crossed the vast ocean of samsara (**taritva samudram iva aparam mahabhavoudham**). This ocean is filled with suffering and is characterized by the four gatis (**chatur gatik samsara sagaram bahu vyasana kulum**). The liberated soul has attained the highest state of liberation (**sarvottamam nirvanam asaditavan**).
* **Abhayam:** One who is fearless and provides protection to all beings (**praninam pran raksharoopam svatha parathach sadupadeshadanaat karotityabhayamkara**). They are fearless because they have conquered all fear (**abhayamkara**).
* **Veer:** One who is a hero and destroys the eight types of karma (**asht prakaram karma visheshenere yati prerayatiti veer**). They are a hero because they have conquered their own inner enemies (**veer**).
* **Anant:** One who has infinite knowledge (**anant aparyavasanam nityam jneyananantatvadva anant chakshuriva chakshu**). Their knowledge is like an infinite eye (**kevalgyanam yasya sa tatheti**).

**Chapter 26**

This verse describes the qualities of the liberated soul (**arhan maharishi**):

* They have conquered the four inner enemies (**kashyaas**): anger (**krodha**), pride (**mana**), delusion (**maya**), and greed (**lobha**).
* They do not create any negative karma (**paapam na karayati**).
* They do not cause others to create negative karma (**naanyai karayati**).

**Commentary**

The commentary explains that the liberated soul is free from all inner enemies (**adhyaatmadosha**). They are a **tirtankara** (**arhan**), a ford-maker, who guides others towards liberation. They are also a **maharishi** (**mahan rishi**), a great sage, because they have conquered all inner enemies. They do not create any negative karma (**paapam**), nor do they cause others to create negative karma (**naanyai karayati**).

##  Tikaartha - The principle of Nyaya Shastra is that when the cause is destroyed, the effect is also destroyed.  Kshayas like anger, etc., are the causes of the worldly state and are spiritual defects.  Lord Mahavira attained the Tirthankara Maharshi position by abandoning these four Kshayas.  In reality, one becomes a Maharshi only when these four spiritual defects - Kshayas - are conquered.  If this does not happen, one does not become a Maharshi.  The Lord himself does not commit Savadya (intentional) sinful karma, nor does he cause others to do so.

**Verse 27:**
**Chhaya:**
Kriyakriye Vainayikanuvaayam, Annyaaninaam Padiyachch Thaanam. Se Savvavaayam iti Veyaitta, Uvatthiye Sanjamdihiraayam.

**Translation:**
The Lord knows the principles of all the different schools of thought, including those who believe in action (Kriyavadi), those who believe in inaction (Akriyavadi), those who believe in humility (Vainayika), and those who believe in ignorance (Agnanika).  He remains engaged in the practice of restraint throughout his life.

**Tika:**
The meaning is that the Lord accepts the position (Sthanam) of the Kriyavadi, Akriyavadi, Vainayika, and Agnanika.  Or, the meaning is that he understands their position (Sthanam) - their path to hell, etc. - by understanding their views (Pratiitya).  We will explain the nature of these schools of thought in another context.  Here, we will briefly explain them:

Those who believe that action is the only means to achieve salvation are called Kriyavadi.  They believe that liberation is achieved through the initiation (Deeksha) of action.  Those who do not believe in action are called Akriyavadi.  They are also called Gnanavadi, and they believe that liberation is achieved through the knowledge of the true nature of reality.  As it is said:

"He who knows the twenty-five Tattvas, whether he lives in an Ashram, has matted hair, is shaven-headed, or has a topknot, is liberated without a doubt."

Those who believe that humility is the path to liberation are called Vainayika, following the teachings of Gosala.  Those who believe that ignorance is the cause of worldly existence are called Agnanika.

The Lord, knowing the positions of all these schools of thought, including the Buddhists, etc., and understanding the true nature of reality, taught them accordingly (Vedayitva).  He remained engaged in restraint (Sanjama) throughout his life, unlike others.  As it is said:

"Unlike others who are eloquent speakers, who have written scriptures, and who are full of pride, you have no faults of arrogance or disrespect towards your disciples."

The meaning of "Dirgharatram" is that he remained engaged in restraint throughout his life.

**Tikaartha:**
Lord Mahavira, knowing the principles of the Kriyavadi, Akriyavadi, Vainayika, and Agnanika, or understanding that all these schools of thought lead to hell, practiced restraint throughout his life.  The nature of these schools of thought will be explained in detail later.  Here, we will briefly explain them:

Those who believe that action is the only means to achieve salvation are called Kriyavadi.  They believe that liberation is achieved through the initiation (Deeksha) of action.  Those who do not believe in action are called Akriyavadi.  They are also called Gnanavadi, and they believe that liberation is achieved through the knowledge of the true nature of reality.  They say that the person who knows the twenty-five Tattvas, whether he lives in an Ashram, has matted hair, is shaven-headed, or has a topknot, is liberated without a doubt.

Those who believe that humility is the path to liberation are called Vainayika, following the teachings of Gosala.  Those who believe that ignorance is the cause of worldly existence are called Agnanika.

---------------------------
The Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra. The followers of the Goshala school believe that liberation is attained only through conduct. They conduct themselves with restraint, hence they are called Vainyaikas. Ignorance is sufficient for the attainment of this world and the next. It is through ignorance that their attainment is achieved. This is the principle of the ignorant. Lord Mahavira, understanding the principles of all these schools of thought, and knowing the Buddhist and other schools as well, and making beings aware of them, remained engaged in the proper observance of restraint. He was not like other schools of thought. A Jain Acharya, praising the Lord who is free from passions, says: "O Lord! The defects of eloquence that are present in other schools of thought - defects in speaking, defects in reasoning - are not present in you. Even though they created scriptures, they only attained smallness, because they and their disciples, who preach to others, do not themselves act according to their own principles. But you remained engaged in the observance of restraint throughout your life."

"He, having renounced women and night meals, was devoted to the destruction of suffering. Knowing this world and the next, the Lord renounced all sins at all times." ||28||

Commentary: The Lord, having renounced - what is that? - "Women" means sexual intercourse with women, "night meals" means living with night meals, this is an indication, and other things like the prohibition of killing living beings should also be understood. And "devoted to austerity" - he who is devoted to austerity - whose body is burnt by austerity, why? - the commentator shows: "suffering" means suffering - the eight kinds of karma, their destruction - their disappearance, that is the meaning. And "knowing this world" - "this" means the world called this world, "the next" means the world called the next world, or "the other" - the human world, the other - hell, etc., knowing their nature and the causes of their attainment, the Lord "renounced all sins" - many times. This means that he himself observed the prohibition of killing living beings, etc., and established others in it. For he who is not established in himself cannot establish others. As it is said:

"Even if one speaks righteously, but acts contrary to one's own words, no one can subdue others who are not subdued themselves. Having firmly established this in your mind, O Lord, you have resolved to subdue yourself, who is not subdued." ||1||

And so on: "The Tirthankaras, the four great ones, are free from the bondage of the world. They shine everywhere, free from the power of ignorance." ||1|| etc. ||28||

Now, Sudharmaswami, the Tirthankara, tells his disciples about the qualities of the Tirthankaras.

Commentary: Lord Mahavira renounced women and night meals. This is merely an indication. It is implied that he also renounced other sins like killing living beings. He burnt his body with austerity. Why did he do this? The commentator explains. That which causes suffering to beings is called suffering. This refers to the eight kinds of karma. He did this to destroy them. He knew this world and the next, or he knew the nature of the human world and hell, etc., and the causes of their attainment, and he renounced all sins that are the root of them.

Page #393:
---------------------------
The study was completely abandoned. This means that the Lord himself abandoned sins like violence and killing, and inspired others to do the same. A man who is not himself established in Dharma, who does not follow Dharma, cannot establish others in Dharma. It is said that a man who speaks justly but acts contrary to his words is himself uncontrolled - he has not been able to control his senses, he is under their control. He cannot make another victorious over the senses. Therefore, O Lord, knowing this, you determined the nature of the entire world and first engaged in controlling yourself. The four omniscient, divine, Tirthankara Bhagwan Mahavira, using all the strength of their power and self-power, were engaged in the practice of restraint for the attainment of liberation. Sudharma Swami Tirthankara, narrating the qualities of the Tirthankara, now says to his disciples:

"Sochcha ya dhamma arahanta bhasiyam, samahitham atthapadovasuddham. Tam saddahana ya jana anaau, inda va devahi va agamissanti tibemi." ||29||

"Cha dharmam adbhasitam samahitham arthapadopa shuddham. Tam shraddhadhana ashcha jana anayusha indra iva devaadhipha agamishyanthi iti." || Bravimi ||

Shadow heard:

-

Translation: Those who hear the Dharma, which is formulated by the Arhat, is collected, has a correct meaning and words, and have faith in it, attain liberation or become like Indra, the lord of the gods.

-

Commentary: "Sochchaya" etc., hearing the Dharma, which is the form of Shruta and Charitra, spoken by the Arhats, is correctly explained, has correct meanings and words, or is purified by them, is well-reasoned, has good reasons, or is pure in terms of the words that are to be spoken, the words that are to be spoken, or the words that are to be spoken. Those who have faith in such Dharma spoken by the Arhats, and follow it, are "jana" people, "anayusha" those who have lost their karma, are Siddhas, or those who have life, are the lords of the gods like Indra. The word "iti" indicates the end. "Bravimi" I speak, as before. ||29|| Thus ends the sixth study called Veerasthava.

Commentary: Dharma is said to be that which saves from falling into hell. It is in the form of Shruta and Charitra. It is spoken by the Arhat-Tirthankara, correctly explained. It is pure in terms of reason and cause, i.e., it is consistent with the best appropriate reason and the best appropriate cause. It is free from defects in terms of the meaning to be conveyed and the words that are to be spoken. Those who have faith in such Dharma spoken by the Arhats, follow its practice. If they are free from karma, they become Siddhas, and if they have life, they become the lords of the gods like Indra. Here, the word "iti" indicates the end. "Bravimi" I speak, as before.

The sixth study called Veerasthuti is complete.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra
### Study of the Seven Kusilas

Earth, water, fire, air, grass, trees, seeds, and trembling beings,
Those born from eggs, those born from wombs, those born from sweat, and those born from sap.
These are the bodies that have been declared, know these seven and be indifferent.
By these bodies, one receives long punishments, and by these, one experiences reversals.

**Commentary:**
The omniscient one has declared earth, water, fire, air, grass, trees, seeds, and trembling beings, those born from eggs, those born from wombs, those born from sweat, and those born from sap, as the bodies of living beings. These bodies desire happiness. Those who destroy these beings with bodies and accumulate sin, will be reborn again and again in these very beings.

**Explanation:**
"Earth" refers to beings with earth bodies. The "cha" (च) indicates a difference within itself. This difference is that beings with earth bodies are subtle like mist and gross. Each of these is further divided into two categories: those with sufficient and insufficient capabilities. Similarly, beings with water bodies, fire bodies, and air bodies should be understood. The text then describes beings with plant bodies, differentiating them as "grass" (like kusha grass), "trees" (like banyan trees), "seeds" (like grains), and other types of plants like creepers and shrubs. "Trembling beings" are those with two senses, like insects. "Those born from eggs" are those born from eggs, like birds and reptiles. "Those born from wombs" are those born from wombs, like cows, horses, goats, and humans. "Those born from sweat" are those born from sweat, like lice, fleas, and worms. "Those born from sap" are those born from sap, like yogurt, sour milk, cheese, and hair.

**Commentary:**
The Bhagavan now explains the different types of living beings and the consequences of harming them. He says, "These" (earth, water, fire, air, grass, trees, seeds, and trembling beings) are the "bodies" (life bodies) that have been "declared" (stated). The neuter gender is used due to the grammatical structure. "In these" (earth bodies, etc.) "seven" (happiness) should be known. This means that all beings desire happiness and hate suffering. Knowing this, one should "be indifferent" (consider with a wise mind). This means that one should understand that by harming these bodies, one harms oneself. This is because harming these bodies leads to self-punishment. Alternatively, "long punishments" (long-lasting punishments) are received by those who harm these bodies. This means that those who harm these bodies for a long time will suffer for a long time. The text then explains the consequences of harming these bodies: "They" (those who harm these bodies) "go" (move) "to these" (earth bodies, etc.) "in various ways" (in many ways). This means that they will be reborn again and again in these very bodies. Alternatively, "reversals" (changes) occur. When beings with bodies act for happiness, they only experience suffering, not happiness. Similarly, if beings with bodies act for liberation, they only experience rebirth, not liberation.

**Commentary:**
Just as those who seek liberation harm these bodies and experience reversals, leading to rebirth, the text explains this further.

Page #395:
---------------------------
There are two types of knowledge, **Kushila** and **Parijna**, and similarly, there are two types of **Aparyapt**. In the same way, there are living beings with **Apkay**, **Agnikay**, and **Vayukay**. This should be known. The **Sutrakara** describes the living beings with **Vanaspati Kay** in different forms. Trees like **Tern-Kush**, **Ashvastha** or **Peepal**, grains like **Beej-Chawal**, creepers and bushes are also types of **Vanaspati**. Those who experience pain are **Dwiindriya** and other beings, birds and snakes born from eggs, and **Jalayuja-Jambal** born from water, cows, buffaloes, goats, sheep, and humans born from **Parivishthatajanma**, and bedbugs and worms born from sweat, and small winged creatures born from yogurt and kanji - all these are living beings.

By showing the different types of living beings, the **Sutrakara** now explains the faults in harming them - in violence. The **Tirthankaras** have called these **Prithvikaay** and other beings as a group of living beings. Here, due to the **Chandas**, the neuter gender is used. It should be known that these **Prithvikaay** and other beings desire happiness. The meaning of saying this is that all these beings desire happiness and hate suffering. Knowing this, men with sharp intellect - with sharp intellect - should consider that by oppressing them, their soul becomes punishable, that is, by harming them, the soul has to suffer. The **Sutrakara** shows the state of those who harm these beings for a long time, who commit violence against them. Those who cause suffering to the aforementioned **Prithvikaay** and other beings, those who torment them, are reborn again and again in these **Prithvikaay** and other yonis.

Beings start the process of harming other beings to gain happiness. They harm them, but they only get suffering from it. They do not get happiness, or the **Kutirthik** and **Mithya Matvadi** who perform actions through these beings for the sake of liberation, their cycle of birth and death in the world increases.

Those who desire liberation by punishing these beings, by harming them, obtain only the world, which is contrary to liberation, as a result of violence. The **Sutrakara** reveals this.

**Jaaiphaham Anuparivattmane, Tasathavarehim Vinighayameti. Se Jaati Jaatim Bahukurakame, Jam Kuvvati Mijati Tena Bale. ||3||**

**Chhaya - Jaati Pathamanuparivartanamanastra-Sasthavareshu Vinighatameti. Sa Jaati Jaatim Bahukrurkarma, Yat Karoti Mriyate Tena Balah. ||**

**Anuvaad -** One who punishes beings with one sense and so on, who harms them, is born in those same yonis with one sense and so on, dies, he is born and destroyed by taking birth in **Trasas** and **Sthavaras**. He is reborn, performing cruel deeds, and dies by his own deeds.

**_Teeka -_** **Jaatinaam** - beings with one sense and so on, **Jaatipath** - the path of birth, **Yadva** - **Jaati** - birth, **Badho** - death, **Jaati** and **Vadha** are **Jaativaadha**, **Anuparivartanah** - wandering among beings with one sense and so on, experiencing birth, old age, and death many times, **Seshu** - in **Tejovaayu Dwiindriya** and so on, in **Sthavaras** - in **Prithvi Ambu Vanaspati**, born in them, **Kayadanda Vipakajena Karma** - by the karma of the result of bodily punishment, **Bahusho Vinighatam** - destruction, **Avatpnoti** - obtains, **Sa** - he, **Ayatadanda Asumaan** - who has received punishment, **Jaatim Jaatim** - obtains birth, **Bahuni Krurani Darunani Anusthanani Yasya** - who performs many cruel and terrible deeds. 
(367)

Page #396:
---------------------------
||
| The Sutra of the Angas of the Sutras says: He who performs many cruel deeds is thus devoid of discrimination, being devoid of the discrimination of the real and the unreal, like a child. For whatever deed of tormenting living beings he performs in the category of one-sense beings and so on, by that very deed he is 'measured', he dies, he is filled. Or, 'he is measured in violence', he is killed. Or, 'he is measured by many cruel deeds', 'this is a thief', 'this is an adulterer', and so on, he is measured by that very deed, he is covered. ||3|| Where then is he measured by those deeds? This is shown - - Commentary - The path of one-sense beings and so on is called the path of the category, or birth is called the category and death is called killing. These two are called category-killing. It should be known here that the 'h' that occurs in Prakrit is changed into both 'th' and 'dh' in Sanskrit. Therefore, here the two forms, category-path and category-killing, are presented. There, the living being wanders in the category of one-sense beings and so on. He experiences birth and death again and again. He is born in fire, air, and two-sense beings and so on, and in earth, water, plants and so on, and due to the result of the deed of punishment and violence, he is destroyed again and again. That living being, who is extremely punishing for living beings and who performs deeds with extreme cruelty and mercilessness, again and again taking birth, is devoid of the discrimination of the real and the unreal, like a child is ignorant. In whatever category of one-sense beings and so on he performs the deed of destroying living beings, by that very deed he dies, or he is killed as a result of that very deed, or he is recognized in the world as a man of very cruel deeds, 'this is a thief', 'this is an adulterer', and so on, as a result of that very deed. Where does he suffer due to his deeds? The author of the sutras reveals this, saying:
If you go to the other side, or if you are a hundred-pointed arrow, or if you are otherwise.
Those who are afflicted by the cycle of existence, they bind and torment the evil ones. ||4|| Shadow - Non-violence in the world, or on the other side, or a hundred-pointed arrow, or otherwise.
Those who are afflicted by the cycle of existence, they bind and torment the evil ones. || Translation - There is a deed that gives fruit to the doer in this very birth, and there is a deed that gives fruit in the next birth. Some deeds give fruit in one birth, while others give fruit in hundreds of births. Some deeds give fruit in the same way as they are done, while others give fruit in a different way. The wicked men always wander in the cycle of existence. They suffer the painful fruit of one deed, and they are tormented by that, which binds them to more deeds. Thus, they always suffer the fruit of their sins.
Commentary - Those deeds that are hasty, they give fruit in that very birth, or they give fruit in the next birth in hell and so on. They give intense fruit in one birth, 'a hundred-pointed arrow', in many births. In whatever way they perform that evil, so it is revealed, and so - 'otherwise', this is said - some deeds give fruit in this very birth, and some in the next birth, as the suffering fruit of the son of a deer is mentioned in the Shrutaanga Shruta Skandha, the long-lasting one is known to be in the next birth, in whatever way, once or many times, or in another way, once or a thousand times, the cutting off of the head, the cutting off of the hands and feet, and so on, is experienced. Thus, those who are skilled and those who are punished by the four paths, having entered the cycle of existence, wander through the cycle of existence like a potter's wheel, experiencing greater and greater suffering, and experiencing the deeds done in the past, they are tormented by one thought.

## Kushila Parijnaadhyayanam

The study of Kushila (cruel) individuals.

**Another point:** They bind and torment the wicked, leading them astray. They believe that evil deeds cannot be destroyed without the destruction of the karma that created them. As it is said:

"Do not be disheartened, O living being! Do not be dejected, miserable, and downtrodden. The suffering you have caused in the past cannot be erased by mere contemplation." (1)

"If you enter the underworld, the forest, a cave, or the ocean, you cannot escape the consequences of your past actions, even if you destroy yourself." (2)

Thus, the Kushila have been explained in detail. Now, the Sutrakar (author of the sutra) speaks about the heretics, without giving them any importance.

**Commentary:**

Actions that bear fruit quickly yield their results in this very life. However, there are many actions that bear fruit in the next life, in hell, etc. Some actions cause intense suffering as a result of their karmic consequences in a single lifetime, while others bear fruit over hundreds of lifetimes. Just as a being performs a wicked action, so too does it receive its fruit, or it may receive it in a different way. In other words, some actions bear fruit in this life, while others bear fruit in the next. The Shruta Skandha, under the heading of "Dukkha Vipaka" (suffering consequences), describes the story of the deer's son. Actions that are long-lasting bear fruit in the next life. The way in which an action is performed, it bears fruit for the doer in the same way, either once or multiple times, or it may bear fruit in a different way, once or thousands of times, in the form of piercing the body, cutting off hands and feet, etc.

Those who are unrighteous and cruel, who inflict great pain and suffering on others, wander endlessly in the cycle of four births (Chaturgati) like a wheel in a well. They wander in the cycle of birth and death and experience intense and unbearable suffering. When they are tormented by the consequences of their past actions, they engage in self-deception, which leads to the binding of new karma and the suffering of the consequences of their evil deeds. This means that self-created karma cannot be destroyed without experiencing its consequences. Therefore, it is said: "O living being! Do not become disheartened, dejected, miserable, downtrodden, and sorrowful, because the suffering you have caused others in the past cannot be erased by mere contemplation. Even if you enter the underworld, the forest, a cave, or the ocean, or even if you commit suicide, you cannot escape the consequences of your past actions."

Thus, the general characteristics of Kushila individuals have been explained. Now, the Sutrakar speaks about the heretics.

"Those who abandon their parents and embrace the Shraman vow, then engage in the practice of fire worship and harm living beings for their own comfort, are Kushila Dharma (followers of a cruel path), as the omniscient ones have said." (5)

**Translation:**

Those who abandon their parents and embrace the Shraman vow, then engage in the practice of fire worship and harm living beings for their own comfort, are Kushila Dharma (followers of a cruel path), as the omniscient ones have said.

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Commentary on the Sutra Kritanga Sutra

The meaning is as follows: Those who are not knowers of the ultimate truth, but have arisen for the sake of religion and virtue, having abandoned their mother and father, declare that "we have taken up the vow of a Shramana (ascetic)." However, they initiate and engage in the activity of Agnikaya (fire-worship), that is, they engage in the activity of Agnikaya by consuming the prescribed food prepared through cooking, heating, etc., and by approving of such activities done by others.

These heretical or lay people who engage in the initiation of Agnikaya are "Kushila" (of corrupt conduct). Here, the indication of abandoning the mother and father suggests that abandoning them is very difficult. Therefore, their mention is made. It is also to be understood that abandoning brothers, sons, etc. is also included here.

So, how can one of corrupt conduct be "Kushila" (of good conduct)? The author shows that those who have existed, exist, and will exist, are called "Bhuta" (beings). The term "Bhuta" refers to living beings. Those who harm living beings for their own happiness are "Kushila."

The heretical people, through the penance of the five fires, torment their bodies, and through the rituals of Agnihatra (fire-oblation), etc., desire to attain heaven. Similarly, the worldly people, by cooking, getting others to cook, etc., in the form of initiating and engaging in the activity of Agnikaya, desire happiness. All of them are "Kushila."

Explaining how the destruction of life occurs in the initiation and engagement of Agnikaya, it is said:

"One who kindles the fire should extinguish the lives, and one who extinguishes the fire should extinguish the lives. Therefore, the wise should observe the Dharma and the learned should not initiate the fire."

The meaning is: One who initiates the fire activity (Agnikaya) destroys the lives of the beings residing in the firewood, etc., and one who extinguishes the fire also destroys the lives of the beings residing in the fire. Therefore, the wise person should observe the Dharma and the learned should not initiate the fire activity.

Page #399:
---------------------------
How does the study of knowledge (**parijñāadhyayanam**) lead to the destruction of many other bodies (**kāya**)? The one who ignites the fire body (**agnikāya**) is the cause of the destruction of many other bodies. The **āgama** says: "O Gautama! Two men engage in the activity of the fire body, one ignites it and the other extinguishes it. Of these two men, which one commits a greater offense and which one commits a lesser offense? O Gautama! The one who ignites the fire body commits a greater offense towards the earth body (**pṛthvīkāya**), water body (**āpkāya**), air body (**vāyukāya**), plant body (**vanaśpattikāya**), and the body of the small creatures (**traskāya**). He commits a lesser offense towards the fire body. The one who extinguishes the fire body commits a lesser offense towards the earth body, water body, air body, plant body, and the body of the small creatures. He commits a greater offense towards the fire body. This is how it is said." It is also said: "There is no doubt that this is the destruction of beings, the burning of beings." (**bhūyāṇam esamādhāo, havvavāo ṇ sansao**)  

Since this is the case, the wise (**medhāvī**) who knows the difference between right and wrong (**sadasadvīvekagña**), who has heard the scriptures (**saśruti**), who has examined the Dharma and the sins (**samiksya dharma pāpāḍḍīna**), and who is a learned person (**paṇḍita**) does not engage in the activity of the fire body. The one who truly is a learned person is the one who refrains from the sin that arises from the activity of the fire body. 

How does the activity of the fire body lead to the killing of other beings? The author of the sutra explains this with an example:

"The beings of the earth, the beings of the water, the beings that are found in wood, they are all destroyed when the fire is ignited." (**puḍhvīvī jīvā āūvī jīvā, pāṇā ya sampāim sampयंति. sanseya ya kaṭṭhasamassiya .ya, ete dahe agani samārabhamte**)

The Sutra of the Sri Sutra Kritanga. Shadow - The earth is also a living being, water is also a living being, and the breaths are also those that fall into the fire.
_ Those born of sweat and those who dwell in wood, he burns them when he starts the fire.
Translation - The person who kindles fire, burns the earth body which is itself a living being, the water body - water, the Sampatimaa - those who fall into the fire and are consumed, the moths, butterflies etc. - the sweat-born living beings born from sweat or perspiration, and the living beings dwelling in wood - he burns all of them.
Commentary - Not only the earth-dwelling two-sensed beings, but also the earth itself, which is characterized by earth, is a living being, and water, which is characterized by fluidity, is a living being, and the breaths that dwell in it, the Sampatimaa - moths, butterflies etc. fall into it, and the Sanswedaja - worms, ants, insects etc. in fuel like dung etc., and those who dwell in wood etc. - all these stationary and mobile beings, he burns them, whoever starts the fire, therefore, the starting of the fire body is a great sin. ||7||
Commentary meaning - In the earth, along with the two-sensed beings dwelling in it, the earth body in the form of clay or soil, the water body in the form of fluid water, the beings dwelling in water, the moths, butterflies etc. that fall into the fire and are consumed, the sweat-born - worms, ants, insects etc. born in fuel like dung etc., and the beings dwelling in wood etc. - all these stationary and mobile beings, he burns them, whoever starts the fire. Thus, the starting of the fire body is highly sinful. .
Green beings are slow, separate from the body of food.
He who cuts them for his own pleasure, destroys many beings with his boldness. ||8|| Shadow - Green beings are slow, separate from the body of food.
He who cuts them for his own pleasure, destroys many beings with his boldness.
Translation - Green grass and sprouts etc. are also living beings. They dwell separately in the branches and leaves etc. of trees. He who cuts them for his own pleasure, destroys many beings with his boldness.
Commentary - And so far, the ascetics who start the fire body, and those who abstain from cooking, like vegetables etc., have been described. Now, those who are not abstaining from the starting of plants are being discussed. Thus, it is said - 'Green grass, sprouts etc., these are also 'beings' because they are seen to grow from food, and 'slow' because they are in the form of living beings, they delay - they hold, for example, a human being becomes from the stages of embryo, foetus, flesh, muscle, womb, birth, child, youth, middle age, old age, and so on. Similarly, green things like grains etc. are born, new, with generated juice, youthful, mature, old, dry, dead, and so on. Trees are also described as being born in the stage of a sprout, growing with roots, trunk, branches, sub-branches, young, mature, etc. This is applicable to the rest of the stages as well. Thus, green things etc. also delay in the form of living beings. Therefore, these are 'separate' - each one is dwelling in the places of roots, trunk, branches, leaves, flowers etc., but in all the roots etc., which are united, there is only one living being. And these beings are innumerable, infinite, different, dwelling in the plant body, for the sake of food, for the sake of body maintenance, for the sake of healing body wounds, or for the sake of 'own pleasure', he cuts them, 'with boldness' - he is bold, he destroys many beings with his strength, and because of that destruction, he has no compassion, neither dharma nor self-pleasure, it is said. ||8|| Moreover -

##  The Study of the Plant Body (Vanaspatikaya)

The principles of those who are not liberated from the beginning of the plant body are now being examined. 

Grass and sprouts, green things are also living beings because it is seen that they grow by food, etc., and take on the form of a living being. Embryo, bud, muscle, fetus, birth, child, youth, middle age, and old age, etc., are the stages of a human being. Similarly, green paddy-rice, etc., also take on the stages of birth, new, born from sap, juicy, young-mature, old-dry, and dead, etc. Trees are also born when they sprout. Thus it is said. Then when they begin to grow in the form of root, trunk, branch, twig, etc., they are called young or saplings. Similarly, their remaining stages should also be arranged. It should be known that green grass, etc., also become living beings. In the roots, trunk, branches, leaves, flowers, etc., of trees, living beings reside separately. From the root to the leaves, there is not one living being in the whole tree, but many living beings. These living beings residing in the plant body are of three types: countable, uncountable, and infinite. Whoever cuts or cuts these living beings for the sake of food, drink, etc., for the growth of the body, or to heal a wound in the body, or for any of his own pleasure, destroys many living beings with arrogance and audacity. To destroy them mercilessly is neither Dharma nor self-happiness.

**Verse 9:**

> "They destroy the species and growth, the seeds, unrestrained, self-punishing. They say, in the world, those who are not of the noble path, those who harm the seeds, they punish themselves."

**Commentary:**

> "Destroying the species, the growth, the seeds, and their fruits, cutting the green things, the unrestrained householder, or the renunciate, or the householder who is the doer of that action, he punishes himself by cutting the green things. For he truly harms himself by harming others. The word 'they say' is a figure of speech in the sentence. It shows what they said: 'He who is cruel, who cuts green things, etc., is 'not of the noble path' in this world.' And who is such a person? He who harms the plant body for the sake of Dharma, or for his own happiness, because this is a symbol of that. He is a heretic or someone else who is not of the noble path."

**Now the ripening of the action of killing and cutting is described.**

**Commentary:**

> "The man who cuts the green plants, he destroys the birth, the sprout, the leaf, the root, the trunk, the branch, and the twig, the growth of other plants that come from it."

Page #402:
---------------------------
The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra states that destroying seeds and fruits is an act of a householder, not a true ascetic. Even a monk who has renounced the world and taken vows, if he commits such an act, is still considered a householder. A man who cuts and breaks green plants punishes his own soul. By destroying another being, he truly destroys his own soul. In this verse, the word "atha" is used in the sense of a figure of speech. Regarding such a man, the Tirthankaras and others have said something. What have they said? Explaining this, the Sutra-kar states that a man devoid of compassion who cuts green plants is an un-Aryan, a cruel doer of karma in this world. Identifying such a man, he says that a man who destroys seeds for his own selfish gain, whether he is a hypocrite or someone else, is an un-Aryan. Here, the destruction of seeds is a metaphor. It refers to the destruction of plant life. Now, explaining the karmic consequences of cutting green plants, the Sutra-kar says:

"Gabbhai mijanti buyaabuyana, nara pare panchasitha kumara. Juvangaa majjhim theraga ya, (pathantrepourusa ya) chayanthi te aoukhae palina." ||10||

**Translation:**

Those who cut and break green plants, many such men perish in their mother's womb. Many die when they are able to speak clearly. Many die before they reach the age of speaking clearly. Many die in their childhood, many in their youth, many in middle age, and many in old age. This means that they die at every stage of life.

**Commentary:**

These men who are like plants, perish in many births, in the stages of the womb, embryo, fetus, flesh, and muscle. Similarly, those who can speak clearly and those who cannot, and those who are five-haired children, die. Similarly, some die in youth, some in middle age, and some in old age. In some texts, it is written "majjhim pourusa ya," which means that those who cut green plants die in middle age, some in old age, and some in extreme old age. Thus, those who cut green plants perish in all stages of life, losing their lifespan. Similarly, one should understand that those who destroy other stationary and mobile beings also have an uncertain lifespan.

---------------------------
Awake, O beings! Human birth is hard to obtain, seeing the fear in the hellish and animal realms.  The world, like a feverish man, is filled with suffering, and through their own actions, beings experience the consequences.

Page #404:
---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states that satisfaction comes from obtaining food. Just as they writhe in distress when they don't get it, so too is the world filled with hundreds of sorrows, and it writhes like one suffering from fever. In this world, the un-Aryan worker man obtains sorrow through his karma. He kills beings for happiness. As a result, he suffers. He wanders through the world, killing living beings for liberation, wandering.

The **karma vipāka** (fruits of actions) that **kushila** (noble) men receive has been explained. Now their **darshan** (philosophical views) are being explained.

##  Kushila Parijnaadhyayanam

**Commentary:** In this human realm, or in the realm of attaining the right to liberation (moksha), how does one attain liberation? In this context, those with minds clouded by ignorance, and those who are deluded and ignorant, misled by others, say that liberation is attained by giving up the consumption of salt. 

**Explanation:**  What is ingested and consumed is called food (aahar). Cooked rice, etc., is called food. What nourishes the essence of food is called aahar samapajjana. This refers to salt (lavan), because it is through salt that the essence of food is nourished and strengthened. Some people say that liberation is attained by giving up salt. Here, a different reading is found, "aahar sapannvajjaneṇa". This means that liberation is attained by giving up the consumption of five types of salt along with food. These five types of salt are: Saindhava, Sauvarchal, Vidam, Roum, and Samudra. All tastes are experienced and expressed through salt. It is said that taste without salt, senses without eyes, dharma without compassion, and happiness without contentment are not truly happiness. Salt is the best among all tastes, oil is the best among all oily substances, and ghee is the best among all nourishing substances. Therefore, giving up salt means giving up all tastes. And liberation is attained by giving up tastes alone, so say these ignorant people.

**Another reading:** "Aaharopad panchakavvajjaneṇa" is also found here. This means that liberation is attained by giving up the consumption of five things in food. This is the statement of some ignorant people. Here, in "aaharopad", the fifth case ending is formed by the grammatical rule "layalopekarmaṇipāñcamī". The five things to be given up in food are: garlic, onion, camel milk, cow meat, and alcohol. Some ignorant people claim that liberation is attained by giving up these five things.

**Another perspective:**  Some Bhagavata specialists like Varibhadraka, etc., claim that liberation is attained by consuming cool water, water that is free from impurities. They present their reasoning: Just as water removes external impurities, it also cleanses internal impurities. Clothes, etc., are purified and cleansed by water. Thus, water has the power to cleanse external impurities. Seeing this, they believe that water cleanses internal impurities as well.

**Another perspective:** Some ascetics, those who follow traditional practices, and Brahmins, etc., claim that liberation is attained by performing fire sacrifices (havan). They say that a person, without desiring heaven, etc., satisfies the fire with offerings like fuel, sacrificial wood, and ghee. This fire sacrifice is for liberation. They attain liberation through this act. Those who perform fire sacrifices with the desire for heaven, etc., attain progress and elevation in the form of attaining heaven, etc. They present this reasoning: Fire burns away the impurities of gold. Thus, the power of fire to burn impurities is evident. It also burns away the internal impurities of the soul in the form of sins. This is certain.

**Conclusion:**  Thus, the author of the sutras refutes these unconnected, inconsistent, rambling, and heterodox views.

**Verse 13:**

**Original:** पाओसिणांणादिसुणत्थि मोक्खो, खारस्स लोणस्स अणासएणं । ते मज्जमंसं लसुणं च भोच्चा, अनत्थ वासं परिकप्पयंति ॥१३॥

**Translation:**  There is no liberation in bathing in the morning, etc., or by not eating salt. They eat marrow, meat, and garlic, and then they think about other things.

Page #406:
---------------------------
##  **The Sutra Kritanga Sutra**

**Translation:**

**Verse:**

Obtaining liberation does not come from performing morning ablutions. Nor does it come from abstaining from eating bitter salt. Other misguided individuals consume alcohol, meat, and garlic, which is contrary to the path of liberation and Dharma. By doing so, they wander in the cycle of birth and death.

**Commentary:**

Liberation is not attained by performing morning ablutions, as the term "etc." implies that washing hands, feet, etc., is also included. Using water causes harm to aquatic life, and liberation cannot be attained through harming living beings. Water, in itself, is not capable of removing external impurities. Even if it were, how could it remove internal impurities? Internal purity comes from purity of thought. If internal purity could be achieved through water for those without pure thoughts, then even fishermen, who kill fish for a living, would attain liberation by bathing in water. Similarly, liberation is not attained by abstaining from consuming five types of salt. It is illogical to say that liberation is attained by those who abstain from consuming salt. Salt is not the only source of nourishment for the body, as milk, sugar, etc., also provide nourishment.

One should ask these misguided individuals: Is liberation attained by abstaining from salt in a physical sense, or in a mental sense? If it is in a physical sense, then everyone living in a region where salt is not produced should naturally attain liberation. This is not observed, nor is it desirable. If it is in a mental sense, then mental purity is paramount, and there is no need to abstain from salt. These ignorant individuals consume alcohol, meat, garlic, etc., and dwell in the world, wandering without attaining liberation. Their actions and conduct are only fit for worldly existence. They do not follow the path of liberation, which consists of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct. Therefore, they dwell in the world, separate from liberation.

Now, the author of the sutra intends to refute these principles in detail.

**Om Om Om**

Those who claim that attaining liberation is possible by touching water in the morning and evening are mistaken. If liberation could be achieved by merely touching water, then many aquatic creatures would have attained liberation.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Verse 15:**

* **Text:** Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra, Maccha ya Kumma ya Sirasiva ya, Maggu ya Uttha (Dṛ) Dagarakkhasa ya. Atthaanameyam Kusala Vayanti, Udageṇa Je Siddhi Mudaharanthi. ||15||
* **Translation:**  "Fish, turtles, reptiles, camels, and water demons - if liberation were achieved by merely touching water, these creatures would be the first to attain it. But this is not observed. Therefore, those who claim liberation is achieved through water are mistaken. This is what the wise, the knowledgeable, say."

**Verse 16:**

* **Text:** Udayam Jai Kammamalam Harejja, Evam Suham Icchhamittameva. Andham Va Neyaram anusaritta, Paanani Chevam Vinihamti Manda. ||16||
* **Translation:** "If water were to remove the stain of karma, then why wouldn't it also remove the stain of good deeds? To believe that liberation is achieved by touching water is merely wishful thinking. The foolish, following blind guides, kill living beings through water rituals."

Kusila Parijna Adhyayana
Tika-artha

If the water washes away the impurities of karmas, it will also destroy the merit-karmic particles. If it does not destroy the merit, it will also not destroy the demerit-karmas. Therefore, the statement that water destroys karmas, washes them away, is merely the speaker's own desire. In reality, bathing in water does not remove the impurities of karmas. This is certain. Even then, the person who follows the Smartha path, like the one born blind from birth, following another blind person, goes on the wrong path, does not reach his desired destination, in the same way, the ignorant beings who believe in purity through water, devoid of the discrimination of right and wrong conduct, commit violence against the water-bodied living beings and the dependent living beings through water ablution. They are certainly violent due to the possibility of taking the lives of water-bodied living beings.

Pavai Kampain Pakuvvato Hi, Siodam Tu Jai Tam Harija. Sijjhinsu Ege Dagsattadhati, Musam Vayante Jala Siddhimahu || 17 ||
Prakurvato Hi, Sitodakam Tu Yadi Tad Dharet.
Siddheyur Eke Dakasattvadhatin, Mrsa Vadanto Jala Siddhi Mahuh ||

Chaya: Papani Karmani
Anuvada: If the water washes away the sins of the sinful, even the fishermen who kill water-bodied living beings may attain liberation. Therefore, those who claim liberation through water are false speakers.

Tika: The 'papani' (sins) are the karmas that are the basis of evil thoughts. The 'karmani' are those that cause harm to living beings. If the water were to wash away the karma that is accumulated through harming living beings, then even the most sinful, those who kill water-bodied living beings, would attain liberation. But this is not observed or desired. Therefore, those who claim liberation through water immersion are speaking falsely.

Hutena Je Siddhi Mudaharanti, Sayam Ca Payan Agani Phusanta. Evam Sia Siddhi Have Tamha, Agani Phusantana Kukammapi || 18 ||
Hutena Ye Siddhi Mudaharan'ti, Sayanca Pratar Agnim Sprśantah. Evam Syat Siddhir Bhavettasmad Agnim Sprśatam Kukarmināmapi ||

Those who claim attainment of perfection (siddhi) through oblations, and touch the fire morning and evening, may also attain perfection. Therefore, even the evil-doers who touch the fire may attain perfection.

Page #410:
---------------------------
English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra states that those who claim to attain moksha (liberation) through performing homa (oblations) in the fire, either in the morning or evening, are propagating false doctrines. If moksha could be attained merely by contact with fire, then even the vile-actioned (kukarmi) individuals who handle fire, such as charcoal-makers, potters, and blacksmiths, should also attain it. Even the mantras and other rituals performed by them cannot be accepted, as the fire consumes the impurities of both the vile-actioned and the fire-oblation performers alike. 

The sutra then states that those who, without proper examination, declare that liberation is attained through such means are deluded. One should instead know the truth through the study of the scriptures and the understanding of the mobile and immobile beings (trasasthavara).

Page #411:
---------------------------
Kusila Parijna-adhyayana. It is that these karmas do not lead to siddhi (spiritual perfection). Therefore, those whose principles are these are ignorant, through these karmas they will attain bhava-bhramana (wandering in the cycle of births and deaths). Therefore, the person who has attained the true knowledge should not harm the living beings, mobile and immobile, for his own happiness.

Commentary - Those who are desirous of liberation have declared that siddhi (spiritual perfection) is attained by contact with water or by agnihotra (fire ritual). This has been said without examination, how so? Because, indeed, in this manner, by immersion in water or by agnihotra, there is no siddhi for the one who is a killer of living beings. And they, not understanding the ultimate truth, by harming the living beings, do evil, thinking it to be dharma (righteousness), and are killed-destroyed in various ways, in which the living being is the slaughter-the cycle of transmigration, they will enter, for by the undertaking of the watery and fiery bodies, the destruction of the mobile and immobile beings is certainly inevitable, and in their destruction is only the cycle of transmigration, not liberation. Therefore, the wise, the discerning of the real and the unreal, having understood the true nature as it is, should reflect on how the happiness can be obtained at present by the mobile and immobile beings, and know-understand this. This is said - "First is knowledge, then compassion, thus abides every self-restrained one. What will the ignorant do, or what will they know of the removal of evil?" etc.

Those who, by harming the living beings, seek happiness, they are without restraint, and the unrestrained, they experience such a state in the cycle of transmigration.

Page #412:
---------------------------
Those who desire happiness through oppression and violence, are devoid of good conduct, devoid of good character, devoid of morality, and are men of evil and wicked character, filled with immorality. They experience such states in the world, as the Sutrakar says:

"They cry, they are cut, they tremble, the doers of karma, separate beings, countless are the monks. Therefore, the wise, abstaining, self-guarded, seeing them, should restrain himself." (20)

Commentary: Those who are engaged in the violence of the body, who desire happiness through the violence of beings, go to hell and other destinations, and are tormented by terrible sufferings. They are consumed by unbearable pain, their minds are filled with fear, they are helpless, they "cry" - they only cry out in sorrow. They are "cut" - they are cut by swords and other weapons, and thus they are "trembling" - they flee. They have karma, therefore they are "doers of karma" - those who are sinful. "Beings" are separate beings, and knowing this, the "monk" who is virtuous, is a good man. Because those who oppress and kill beings are destroyed in the world, therefore the "wise" - the learned - abstain from sinful actions, and he is "self-guarded" - his mind, speech, and body are guarded. Seeing the "trembling" - the mobile beings, and the "stationary" - the immobile beings, he should "restrain himself" - he should stop from doing actions that harm them. (20)

Now, the wicked ones of their own group are being described.

"He who enjoys what is obtained by dharma, he who bathes with a rough cloth, he who runs and adorns his clothes, they say he is far from nakedness." (21)

## Translation:

**Kushila Parigyaadhyayanam Anuvaad:**

A man who, while appearing to be a Sadhu, abandons the pure diet obtained through Dharma and indulges in delicious food, bathes in impure water in an impure place, washes his clothes and feet for beauty, and alters the size of his clothes for adornment, is far removed from restraint. This is how the Tirthankaras and Ganadharas have described it.

**Tika:**

The word "ye" refers to those who, while appearing to be cool and calm, have obtained Dharma through their actions, which is free from defects like being obtained through deceit, purchase, or creation. Such a person, even after obtaining such a diet, abandons it and consumes food that is not pure. Similarly, those who bathe their entire body in impure water, in an impure place, and who wash their clothes and alter their size for beauty, are far removed from the state of being "Naganijassa," which signifies freedom from attachment and the practice of restraint. They do not possess restraint. This is what the Tirthankaras, Ganadharas, and others have said.

**Kamma Parinnaay Dagansi Dhire, Viyadeṇ Jīvija Ya Ādimokkhaṁ:**

A wise man, understanding that actions are bound by water, should live his life with impure water until he attains liberation. He should abstain from consuming seeds, roots, and tubers. He should refrain from bathing and indulging in sexual activities.

**Chhaya:**

A wise man, understanding that actions are bound by water, should live his life with impure water until he attains liberation. He should abstain from consuming seeds, roots, and tubers. He should refrain from bathing and indulging in sexual activities.

**Anuvaad:**

A wise man, with a steady mind, understands that actions are bound by water. Therefore, he should live his life with impure water until he attains liberation. He should abstain from consuming seeds, roots, and tubers. He should refrain from bathing and indulging in sexual activities.

**Tika:**

The word "Dhiro" refers to a wise man, whose mind is clear. The phrase "Udgansi" refers to the use of water, which leads to the binding of actions. Understanding this, what should a wise man do? The text says, "Viyadeṇ" - he should sustain his life with impure water, like rainwater or well water. The word "Jīvyāt" means to sustain life. The word "Ādi" refers to the beginning, and "Moksha" refers to liberation. Therefore, "Ādimokkhaṁ" means until liberation, or until the end of the cycle of birth and death. The text also says that a Sadhu should abstain from consuming seeds, roots, and tubers. The word "Ādi" implies that fruits and leaves are also included. He should avoid all unripe food and remain detached. This is what the text indicates.

Page #414:
---------------------------
The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra states that those who engage in actions like bathing, anointing, and cleansing, or who engage in other actions like medical treatment, without a pure body, and those who are not celibate, are considered to be bound by the five types of karma.  Even those who abstain from the five types of karma are still bound by other types of karma.  However, those who are free from all types of karma are not affected by the five types of karma and are not bound by the cycle of birth and death.  Therefore, they do not suffer and are not afflicted by various types of misfortunes.  ||22||

Again, addressing those who are not free from the five types of karma, the text says:

Commentary: A person who is endowed with wisdom and fortitude is called a "Dheer."  "Dheer" means wise.  Knowing that consuming water that causes harm to living beings leads to the accumulation of karma, what should such a person do?  The author of the text states that such a person should sustain their life by consuming water that is not harmful to living beings.  The use of the word "cha" here indicates that they should only consume water that is not harmful to living beings.  The world is called "Adi" (beginning).  Liberation from the world is called "Moksha" (salvation).  Until Moksha is attained, a virtuous person should sustain their life by consuming only those things that are not harmful to living beings.  Or, until the end of this body, which is due to the power of Dharma, they should sustain their life by consuming only those things that are not harmful to living beings.  They should not consume seeds, tubers, etc.  The word "Adi" here includes roots and fruits.  A virtuous person should abstain from consuming roots, leaves, and fruits that are not harmless to living beings.  Why do they abstain from these things?  The author of the text explains that a virtuous person refrains from bathing, anointing their body with oil, and applying lotions.  They do not adorn their body.  They do not engage in medical treatment, etc.  They abstain from sexual intercourse with women.  Here, the word "Vastra Nirodha" (abstinence from clothing) also implies other types of karma.  A person who lives this way is free from all types of karma.  They are not affected by the vices of "Kushila" (unwholesome conduct).  Because they are not affected by these vices, they do not wander in the cycle of birth and death.  Therefore, they do not suffer and are not afflicted by various types of misfortunes.

Again, addressing those who are not free from the five types of karma, the text says:

Those who abandon their mother, father, home, children, animals, and wealth, but who still run after delicious food in homes where such food is available, are far from the path of a "Shraman" (ascetic).  ||23||

Commentary: Those who have attained perfect knowledge and have abandoned their mother, father, home, children, animals, and wealth, are considered to have abandoned their family.  Therefore, it should be understood that they have also abandoned their brothers, sisters, etc.  Similarly, "Aagar" (home) refers to the house, "Putra" (son) refers to offspring, "Pashu" (animal) refers to elephants, horses, chariots, cows, buffaloes, etc., and "Dhan" (wealth) refers to wealth.  Having abandoned all of these things, they have taken the vow of renunciation and have taken upon themselves the burden of the five great vows.  They have become pure and virtuous.  But, if they still crave delicious food and run after homes where such food is available, they are far from the path of a "Shraman" (ascetic).  This is what the Tirthankaras and their followers have said.  ||23||

To further clarify this point, the text says: (Granthamram 4750)

Kuśīla Pariññādhyayana

The one who is not fully mature in dharma - whose devotion to dharma is not completely ripe, he is mainly attached to mother, father, home, children, family, animals like elephants, horses, chariots, cows, buffaloes, and wealth and property. Renouncing all these, he properly accepts the vow of initiation and bears the burden of the five great vows on his shoulders. Being devoid of noble character and spiritual strength, he becomes greedy for taste, delicious food, and material pleasures, and runs towards those houses where he is likely to get such food. He is far from the spirit of asceticism - saintliness, as the Tirthankaras and Ganadhars have said. Here, the mention of the renunciation of parents implies that it is very difficult to leave them. Therefore, one should understand the renunciation of brothers, daughters, etc. along with the parents.

Explaining the subject matter in detail, it is said:

The one who runs towards sweet-smelling houses, being greedy for the belly, he preaches dharma there, and praises his own qualities to obtain food. He is not even one-hundredth part of the virtues of the Acharyas - he is not even one percent correct. The Tirthankaras have said so.

Leaving the poor, he runs towards the rich for food, being greedy for the belly. They say that he is not even one-hundredth part of the virtues of the Acharyas, who would speak for the sake of obtaining food.

Commentary: The one who 'runs towards' (dhāvati) the houses with delicious food, and going there, 'explains' (ākhyāti) the dharma, or entered for the purpose of begging, and explains whatever narrative is pleasing to him - what kind of person is he? He is 'greedy for the belly' (udara-anugṛddha), i.e., engrossed in filling the belly, intent on rubbing the belly. This means - the one who, for the sake of food or other means, goes to the houses of charitable faith and narrates stories, he is called a kuśīla (unvirtuous). And he is not even one-hundredth part of the virtues of the Acharyas or the noble ones, the statement of 'one-hundredth' is an indication, he is even less than one-thousandth part. The one who 'would speak' (ālapayed) the qualities of himself for the sake of food or other means, he too is not even one-thousandth part of the noble qualities, what to say of the one who himself proclaims his own praise.

Leaving the poor, he runs towards the rich for food, being greedy for the belly. They say that he is not even one-hundredth part of the virtues of the Acharyas, who would speak for the sake of obtaining food.

Shadow
Translation: The man who abandons his home and becomes a renunciant, yet still praises others like a flatterer, seeking food from others, is like a large pig attached to rice grains, eager only to fill his belly. He quickly meets destruction - his restraint is corrupted.
Commentary: This man, having abandoned his own wealth, grain, gold, etc., and having gone out, becomes 'deen' (humble) in the matter of food from others, and being controlled by his tongue, becomes 'mukhamangalik' (a flatterer) like a bard, speaking auspicious words with his mouth - words of praise like "you are such and such", "you are like this", etc. He speaks in a humble manner. It is said: "He is the one whose qualities are spread in all ten directions. I used to hear about him only in stories, but today I have seen you in person. You are the same."  Being greedy for such praise, he is well-suited for what? 'Neevar' is a type of food for pigs and other animals. He is attached to it, and taking his own herd with him, the 'mahavaraha' (large pig) becomes very eager for food, and entering into great distress, he will quickly meet 'ghaat' (destruction). The 'eva' (indeed) emphasizes that his destruction is certain, there is no other path. Thus, this man, who is also greedy for food, will repeatedly meet destruction in the womb of the world.
Commentary: The man who abandons his wealth, grain, and possessions, leaves home, and then becomes attached to food obtained from others, is like a bard who flatters others with his words. He speaks words of praise like "you are such and such", "you are like this", etc. He is like a large pig attached to rice grains, eager only to fill his belly. He quickly meets destruction - his restraint is corrupted.
Sri Sutra Kritanga Sutra
Having gone out, being humble in the matter of food from others, being a flatterer, being attached to his belly. Like a pig attached to 'neevar', the large pig will quickly meet destruction.
The food and drink of this worldly man, he speaks pleasingly to those who serve him. He is also a companion and a good man, but he is empty like chaff.

Commentary:
The good man speaks pleasingly to those who serve him, whether it be for food, drink, or worldly things like clothes, etc. If something is pleasing to him, he speaks to him, he speaks to him in return, like a parrot, or like a servant, he follows the words of the king, etc. This is the meaning. He is the same...

---------------------------
A **kushila** is one who, for the sake of receiving food, drink, clothing, and other worldly possessions, speaks in a way that is pleasing to the giver, even if it means flattering them. They are like a servant of a king or a flatterer who agrees with everything the king says. They are **gṛddha** (greedy) for food and do all this for the sake of their own desires. Such a person is **sadācāra-bhraṣṭa** (corrupted in good conduct) and falls into **pārśvastha-bhāva** (a state of being on the side, not fully committed to the path). They are **niḥsāra** (without essence), like chaff after the grain has been removed. They are **pulāka** (like a husk) and have no real **samyamāna-uṣṭhāna** (practice of self-control). Such a person is **liṅgamātra-avaseṣa** (only a shell of a being) and is despised by their own community. In the afterlife, they will receive **nikṛṣṭa-yātanā-sthāna** (the lowest levels of hell).

This is the description of a **kushila**. Now, to describe their opposite, the **suśīla** (those of good character), the text says:

**A person should sustain themselves with food that is unknown, free from any defects, and not seek praise or honor through austerity. They should remain detached from all worldly desires, including sounds, forms, and tastes.**

The **ti̇kā** (commentary) explains that the food should be **ajñāta** (unknown) and **anta-prānta** (obtained from the edges of society). It also says that one should not be **daitya** (proud) if they receive something good, nor should they perform **tapa** (austerity) for the sake of praise or honor. Even if one performs great austerity, it should not be done for the sake of **mukti** (liberation) but for the sake of **sarva-sarva** (the ultimate reality).

The text also says that one should not be **gṛddha** (greedy) for **rasa** (taste), nor for **śabda** (sound) or any other worldly desire. One should not be **asajja** (attached) to **veṇu-vīṇā** (flutes and lutes) or other instruments, nor should they be **karkaśa** (harsh) towards those who are not pleasing to them. One should not be **rāga-dveṣa** (attached to pleasure and aversion) towards **rūpa** (forms) that are not pleasing to them. In short, one should be **vinīya** (detached) from all **kāma** (desires).

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**"Kamai:"** One should restrain all desires, including those arising from lust, by practicing self-control. One should not develop attachment or aversion to any object that is pleasing to the senses. As it is said:

**"Sadde-su ya bhaddayapavaesu, soyavisa-yamuvagaesu. Tutt-ena va rutth-ena va, sam-an-ena saya na hoyavvam. ||1||"**

**Translation:**  Even when hearing pleasant or unpleasant sounds, a monk should not be pleased or displeased. ||1||

**"Ruve-su ya bhaddayapavaesu, chakkhuvisa-yamuvagaesu. Tutt-ena va rutth-ena va sam-an-ena saya na hoyavvam. ||2||"**

**Translation:**  Even when seeing pleasant or unpleasant sights, a monk should not be pleased or displeased. ||2||

**"Gandhe ya bhaddayapavasu, ghanavisa-yamuvagaesu. Tutt-ena va rudv-ena va sam-an-ena saya na hoyavve. ||3||"**

**Translation:**  Even when smelling pleasant or unpleasant scents, a monk should not be pleased or displeased. ||3||

**"Bhakhe-su ya bhaddayapavasu, rasanavisa-yamuvagaesu. Tutt-ena va rudv-ena va sam-an-ena saya na hoyavvam. ||4||"**

**Translation:**  Even when tasting pleasant or unpleasant flavors, a monk should not be pleased or displeased. ||4||

**"Pha-se-su ya bhaddayapavaesu, phasavisa-yamuvagaesu. Tutt-ena va rudv-ena va sam-an-ena saya na hoyavvam. ||5||"**

**Translation:**  Even when experiencing pleasant or unpleasant touch, a monk should not be pleased or displeased. ||5||

**"||27||"**  Just as the restraint of the senses is necessary, so too is the restraint of other attachments.

**Commentary:**  An unknown object is one that has no connection to the past or future. A monk should live by consuming such unknown objects. This means that a monk should not feel dejected if they receive little food, nor should they feel proud if they receive good food. They should not perform austerities for the sake of honor or respect, nor should they perform austerities for the sake of liberation. They should not consider their past austerities as useless or meaningless. It is said that austerity and scripture are the two things that lead to the highest place in the afterlife. When one desires worldly things, these two become as useless as a piece of straw. A monk should not be greedy or attached to taste. Similarly, they should not be attached to sounds, sights, smells, or touch. The author of the sutra states that a monk should not be attached to the sounds of flutes, veenas, etc., nor should they feel aversion to harsh, unpleasant words. Similarly, they should not feel attachment or aversion to beautiful or ugly forms. They should practice self-control by abandoning attachment to all sensual pleasures. They should not feel attachment or aversion to beautiful or ugly objects.

**Translation:**  Even when hearing pleasant or unpleasant sounds, a monk should not be pleased or displeased. Even when seeing pleasant or unpleasant sights, a monk should not be pleased or displeased. Even when smelling pleasant or unpleasant scents, a monk should not be pleased or displeased. Even when tasting pleasant or unpleasant flavors, a monk should not be pleased or displeased. Even when experiencing pleasant or unpleasant touch, a monk should not be pleased or displeased.

**"Just as the restraint of the senses is necessary, so too is the restraint of other attachments."**

**"Om Om Om"**

**"Savvai sangai aiccha dhire, savvai dukkhai-n titikkhamane. Akhile agiddhe jani-eyachari, abhayankare bhikku-anavilappa. ||28||"**

**Translation:**  "He who is patient in all associations, he who endures all suffering, he who is free from greed, he who is a true follower of the path, he who is fearless, he is the monk who is free from attachment." ||28||

**Commentary:** The Muni, the knower of the three times - past, present, and future - should eat for the sake of carrying the burden of the five great vows, and should desire the destruction of his past karma. That which gives pain, that which causes suffering, is called suffering. It is born from trials and tribulations. When the Sadhu is touched by it, he should take refuge in restraint, in liberation.

- If one is oppressed, they should focus their attention on restraint or liberation. Just as a valiant warrior in the battlefield, oppressed by the valiant warriors and soldiers of the opposing side, suppresses and destroys those enemy soldiers, in the same way, a sage, afflicted by trials and tribulations, should suppress and destroy the enemy in the form of karma.
Even if one is being killed, they should desire the arrival of death. By destroying karma, one does not enter the cycle of existence, just as a chariot does not move when the axle is broken.
Commentary: Even if one is being killed by trials and tribulations, they should endure it properly. How? Just as a wooden plank, being chipped away from both sides, does not become attached to either side, in the same way, a sage, whose body is weakened and emaciated by external and internal austerities, does not become attached to either attachment or aversion, but desires the arrival of death. In this way, by destroying the eight types of karma, they do not return to the cycle of existence, which is full of birth, old age, death, disease, sorrow, etc., like a puppet show. The example is given: Just as a chariot does not move when the axle is broken, because it is without support on a level or uneven path, in the same way, a sage, by destroying the eight types of karma, does not return to the cycle of existence.
The commentary ends. The meaning is the same as before. The word "bravimi" means "I say" and should be understood as before.
The seventh study, called "Kushila Paribhasa", is complete.

## The Eighth Chapter of the Shri Veeryadhyayan

**Verse 1:**

> Two types of Veerya are explained, what is the Veerya of a Veera? How is he called a Veera?

**Commentary:**

> The omniscient ones have explained two types of Veerya. What is the Veerya of a Veera? Why is he called a Veera? This question is to be discussed.

**Explanation:**

> The word "dvividha" (two types) indicates that there are two types of Veerya. The word "idam" refers to what is being explained further. The Tirthankaras and others have explained these two types of Veerya. The word "va" is used for the sake of beauty in the sentence. According to the sutra "Eer-Gati-Pree-ranayo", the root "Eer" means "to move" or "to inspire". The word "Veerya" is derived from the root "Eer". The one who specifically removes evil is called Veerya. Veerya is a special power of the soul. Here, the question arises: What is the Veerya of a warrior? And how is he called a Veera? The word "nu" in this verse indicates a question. Here, the question arises: What is that Veerya? What is the nature of the Veerya of a Veera?

> The author explains the nature of Veerya through its two types.

**Verse 2:**

> Some say that Karma is Veerya, while others say that Akarma is Veerya. These two are the places where all mortals are seen.

**Commentary:**

> Shri Sudharma Swami, Jambu Swami, and other disciples are addressed: "O virtuous practitioners! Some say that Karma is Veerya, while others say that Akarma is Veerya. These two are the places where all mortals are seen."

**Explanation:**

> Shri Sudharma Swami, Jambu Swami, and other disciples are addressed: "O virtuous practitioners! Some say that Karma is Veerya, while others say that Akarma is Veerya. These two are the places where all mortals are seen."

Page #422:
---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra
**Commentary:** Some say that the performance of actions (karma) is itself viriya (energy). Others say that the eight types of karma, due to their role in causing effects, are viriya. As it is said: Karma is born from the arising of a state (audayika bhaava). And the arising state is also born from the arising of karma. This is called balaviriya (child-like energy). The second type is called akarma (non-karma), which is the innate energy of the jiva (soul) born from the destruction of the obstacle to viriya. This is the meaning of the word "cha" (and). The energy born from the destruction of the obstacles to charitra (conduct) and mohaniya (delusion) is called panditaviriya (wise energy). O Suvrata! Know this panditaviriya. Viriya is established through these two types: balaviriya and panditaviriya, which are further divided into karma-based and non-karma-based. Those who are established in these two types are called "dissanta" (seen) in the world of mortals. As it is said: When a mortal is seen performing various actions with enthusiasm and strength, he is called "viriyavan" (energetic). And when the obstacle to viriya is destroyed, he is called "ananta balayukta" (possessing infinite strength).

**Commentary:** The performance of actions, giving them a concrete form, is viriya. Many say so. Many others, while explaining the role of karma in causing effects, call the eight types of karma as viriya. That which is born from the arising of a state (audayika bhaava) is called karma. The arising state is also born from the arising of karma. This is called balaviriya (child-like energy).

The second type is called akarma (non-karma), which is the innate energy of the jiva (soul) born from the destruction of the obstacle to viriya. The use of the word "cha" (and) here indicates that the energy born from the destruction of the obstacles to charitra (conduct) and mohaniya (delusion) is called panditaviriya (wise energy). O virtuous ones! Know this panditaviriya. Viriya is established through these two types: balaviriya and panditaviriya, which are further divided into karma-based and non-karma-based. Thus, viriya is described as having two types. All beings in the mortal world are divided into these two types. This is seen and described. Because when a man is seen performing various actions with enthusiasm and strength, people say, "This man is energetic." And when the obstacle to viriya is destroyed, it is said, "This man is possessing infinite strength."

Here, the sutrakar (author of the sutra) has called karma as balaviriya, explaining the role of karma in causing effects. Now, explaining the role of karma in causing effects, the sutrakar describes pramada (negligence) as karma, saying:

**Pramaayam kammamaahansu, tabbhaavaadeso vaavi,
Chhaya pramaadam kammamaahurapramaadam
Appmaayam
Baalam
-
Tahaa'varam. Va ||3||
Pandiyameva
Tathaa'param.
Tadbhaavaadeshato vaa'pi baalam pandiyameva va ||**

**Translation:** Pramada (negligence) is called karma and apramaada (non-negligence) is called akarma. Therefore, balaviriya arises from the presence of pramada and panditaviriya arises from the presence of apramaada.

**Commentary:** Those who are negligent (pramadyanti) are those who do not perform their duties properly. This pramada is like intoxication, etc. As it is said:

Page #423:
---------------------------
##  Sri Viryaadhyayanam.  

**Verse 1:**  
"The five things that are said to be the causes of delusion are: intoxication, sense objects, passions, sleep, and idle talk. This delusion, which is the cause of karma, is described by the liberated ones."

**Commentary:**  
"The Tirthankaras and others have said that this delusion is the cause of karma, and that freedom from delusion is the absence of karma. This means that a deluded being is bound by karma, and the actions of such a being are called 'balaviryam' (childish strength). A non-deluded being is free from karma, and his actions are called 'panditviryam' (wise strength).  

**Verse 3:**  
"Therefore, the actions of a deluded being are called 'balaviryam', and the actions of a non-deluded being are called 'panditviryam'.  The existence of both 'balaviryam' and 'panditviryam' is the reason for the respective actions of the child and the wise.  

**Commentary:**  
"The 'balaviryam' of an abhyavi (non-liberated being) is without beginning and without end, while the 'balaviryam' of a bhavi (liberated being) is without beginning but has an end.  The 'panditviryam' of a bhavi is always with a beginning and an end.  

**Verse 4:**  
"Some learn the art of warfare to kill living beings, and some learn mantras that destroy life."

**Commentary:**  
"Some people learn the art of warfare, such as archery and swordsmanship, to kill living beings.  They learn these skills with great enthusiasm, and they use them to destroy life.  They are taught how to kill living beings with weapons, and they are told that this is the way to achieve victory."

Page #424:
---------------------------
- The Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra states, "Cover the target with your fist, place your sight on the fist. If your head does not tremble, know that the target has been hit." (1)
Thus, a special type of liquor called Abhayaniṣṭa should be given to a person suffering from consumption, and a punishment like piercing with a spear should be given to a thief. According to Chanakya, one should deceive another for the sake of acquiring wealth. Thus, the Kama Shastra and other such scriptures are studied by those who are of a wicked disposition. The practice of weapons, archery, and other scriptures is all balavīrya, which means it is a waste of energy. Some people study the Atharva Veda mantras for the purpose of performing Ashvamedha, Naramedha, Sarvamedha, and other sacrifices, which are destructive to beings. What kind of mantras are these? The Sutrakar explains that those who are of a wicked disposition recite the mantras of the Rig Veda, which cause suffering to beings with two senses or more, and to the earth and other elements. In this regard, it is said:
"Six hundred are employed, in the middle of the day for animals. The words of the Ashvamedha are less than three animals." (1) etc. (4) Now, the Sutrakar explains the word "saththa" in the Sutra, which is used in the context of weapons.
Commentary: Many men, driven by the desire for pleasure and fame, learn the use of swords and other weapons, and the scriptures of archery, with great effort and dedication. The knowledge they acquire is for the destruction of animals, because these scriptures teach how to kill living beings by aiming at specific points on the body, and by moving the feet and hands in specific ways. It is said that the target should be covered with the fist, and the sight should be placed on the fist. If the head does not tremble while releasing the arrow, then the target is considered to be hit. In the science of medicine, it is said that the juice of the Lavaka bird should be given to a patient suffering from consumption. He should also be given Abhayariṣṭa, which is a type of liquor. Chanakya's Arthashastra states that one should deceive another for the sake of acquiring wealth. Therefore, these scriptures, and the Kama Shastra, are studied by those who are of a wicked disposition. The study of weapons, archery, and other scriptures is balavīrya, which means it is a waste of energy. Some people study the Atharva Veda mantras for the purpose of performing Ashvamedha, Naramedha, Sarvamedha, and other sacrifices, which are destructive to beings. These mantras are of a wicked nature. The Sutrakar explains that those who are of a wicked disposition recite the mantras of the Rig Veda, which cause suffering to beings with two senses or more, and to the earth and other elements. In this regard, it is said:
"Six hundred are employed, in the middle of the day for animals. The words of the Ashvamedha are less than three animals." (1) etc. (4) Now, the Sutrakar explains the word "saththa" in the Sutra, which is used in the context of weapons.
Commentary: Weapons, such as swords, are created by divine action, which is guided by knowledge and mantras. There are five types of weapons: earthly, watery, fiery, aerial, and mixed.

English translation preserving Jain terms:

The Shri Viryaadhyayan Anuvad - The weapon with which an attack is made is called a Shastra-hathiyaar. This includes swords and other such weapons. When empowered by Vidya (spiritual knowledge), Mantra (sacred formulas), Deva Karmakrit (divine actions), or Divya Kriya (divine activities), it becomes an Astra. It is of five types - Parthiv (earthly), Varuna (aquatic), Agneya (fiery), Vayavya (aerial), or a combination of any two of these.

Maino katta maaya ya, kaambhoge samaarambhe. Hanta chetta pagavibhatta, 'aayasaayaanugaamino' ||5|| 
Translation - The deceitful and crafty people, through the use of Maya (illusion/deception), engage in sensual pleasures. They are the killers, cutters, and mutilators - following their own selfish interests.

Commentary - 'Maya' refers to the intellect involved in deceiving and cheating others. Those who possess this Maya are called Mayavins (deceitful). By creating deceptions and frauds, they, being prone to anger, ego, and greed, indulge in the objects of senses (Kaambhoga) such as sound, touch, etc. Alternatively, the phrase 'aarambhaaya tivattai' suggests that these sensual-pleasure-seeking individuals engage in acts of violence, binding, destroying, and commanding others for the sake of their own enjoyment and wealth acquisition. Being desirous of their own happiness and averse to suffering, they are polluted by passions and become killers, cutters of body parts like ears, nose, etc., and mutilators.

**Verse 6**

**Text:**

* The Sutra Kritanga Sutra
* By mind, speech, and body, or even by mind and speech if the body is unable, the unrestrained person destroys beings in this world and the next. They also cause others to do so.
* Commentary: This destruction of beings by mind, speech, and body, by doing, causing to do, and approving, is called "Antasha." Even if the body is unable, like a grain of rice and a fish, they bind karma by the mind alone, by approving of evil deeds. Thus, it is said in the worldly scriptures that they are "Arahant" and "Parata." Considering this, the unrestrained person, by doing it themselves and causing others to do it, is a destroyer of beings in both this world and the next. This is the meaning. ||6|| Now, to show the result of destroying beings, the Sutra-maker says:
* -
* By mind, speech, and body, or even by mind and speech if the body is unable, the unrestrained person destroys beings in this world and the next. They also cause others to do so.
* -
* Antasha.
* Unrestrained. ||6||
* Commentary: The unrestrained person destroys beings by mind, speech, and body, by doing it themselves, causing others to do it, and approving of it. Even if the body is unable, like a grain of rice and a fish, they bind karma by the mind alone, by approving of evil deeds. This is just a worldly scripture's logic or understanding. Considering this, the unrestrained person, by doing it themselves and causing others to do it, is a destroyer of beings in both this world and the next. Thus, they are destroyers of beings. Now, to show the result of destroying beings, the Sutra-maker says:
* -
* The enemy creates enmity, and then is ruled by enmity. The beginnings of evil deeds are the cause of suffering, and they touch within. ||

##  Sri Viryaadhyayanam

**This is because the sins, the sins that walk with the sins, the sins that are connected with the sins, the Saavady Anushthan - the Ashubhkarma, when they mature, when the time comes for them to bear fruit, then they produce suffering, that is, their Vipaak-Paripaak manifests as Asataavedaniya - in the form of suffering.**

**I**

**Samparayam**

**Niyachchanti, Antadukkadakarino. Raagadosassya Bala, Paavam Kuvvamti Te Bahu. ||8||**

**Chhaya Samparayam Niyachchantyatmadushkrit Karino. Raagadveshasrita Bala, Paapam Kurvanti Te Bahu. ||**

**Anuvaad**

**Aatma Dushkritkari - The beings who perform their own corrupt actions - sinful actions, bind the Saamparayik Karma. Raagadveshasrita - The ignorant ones who are attached to attachment and aversion, bind many sins.**

**Teeka - 'Samparayam Niyachchanti' etc., there are two types of Karma - Iryapath and Saamparayik. There, Saamparayik is derived from Baadarakashayas. Because it is oppressive to the being, it is connected with enmity, 'Aatmadushkritkarino' - those who are the creators of their own sins, 'Niyachchanti' - bind them. It is further specified - 'Raagadveshasrita' - those who are polluted by the Kashayas, their inner selves are like children, because they are devoid of the discrimination between the good and the bad. Such ignorant people 'Paapam' - do many 'Bahus' - infinite 'Kurvanti' - actions.**

**Thus, the Sutrakar, desiring to show the strength of the child, says - 'Evam Balaviryam' - 'Iryapath' and 'Saamparayik' are two types of Karma. The meaning of 'Samparay' is the Baadarastahul Kashayas. The evil deeds that arise from it, because they are connected with enmity, lead to the violence of beings. Thus, the beings bind this Karma. While describing the characteristics of those who perform sinful actions, it is stated that those who are attached to attachment and aversion - those who are filled with attachment and aversion, whose inner selves are polluted by the Kashayas, are ignorant like children, because they are devoid of the knowledge of the good and the bad. Such ignorant people commit infinite sins. Thus, the Sutrakar, showing the strength of the child and concluding it, says - 'Evam Itto'.**

**Etath Sakarmaviriy, Balanan Tu Praveditam. Ato'karmaviriy Pandithanam Shrunuta Me. ||**

**Anuvaad - The Sakarmaviriy of the children - the ignorant ones, has been discussed. Now, from here, listen to me about the Akarmaviriy of the Panditas - the wise ones.**

**Praveditam. Suneh Me. ||9||**

**Teeka - 'Etath' - what was shown earlier, for example, some people learn weapons or scriptures for the purpose of killing beings, others learn mantras that harm beings, and others, who are magicians, perform various kinds of magic for the sake of enjoyment. **

Page #428:
---------------------------
- The Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra states that some people, driven by enmity, engage in actions that perpetuate animosity. For example, Jamadagni destroyed Kartavirya in retaliation for his wife's mistreatment. Kartavirya's son then killed Jamadagni, leading to Jamadagni's son, Parashurama, making the earth devoid of Kshatriyas seven times. Subsequently, Kartavirya's son, Subhume, killed Brahmanas twenty-one times. As it is said:
"A powerful man is not satisfied with an act of retaliation equal to the offense. He desires to inflict greater pain on his enemy and strives to eradicate him completely." (1)

Thus, beings under the influence of passions engage in actions that perpetuate animosity, extending to their children and grandchildren. This is the strength of those who engage in actions, the ignorant and the careless. It has been explained and elaborated upon.

Now, I will describe the strength of those who do not engage in actions, the wise. Listen to me. As promised, the Sutrakar says:

"Free from material attachments, completely liberated from all bonds, he destroys the evil karma, like fire consuming fuel, from within." (10)

Commentary: "Dravya" refers to a being worthy of liberation. "Dravya cha bhavye" (material possessions belong to the worthy) indicates that he is free from passions, devoid of attachment and aversion. Alternatively, it could mean that he is like a liberated being, with minimal passions. As it is said: 
-400

Page #429:
---------------------------
## Vitaraga
- **Shri Veeryadhyayana.** "Can anyone be said to be free from passions (kashaya) while dwelling in the realm of passions? Even one who restrains passions is similar to one who has passions." (1)
**Shadow:** "Can it be said that anyone is free from passions while dwelling in the realm of passions? Even one who restrains passions is similar to one who has passions." (2)

What is the nature of such a person? The text explains: "Free from bondage" - free from passions, which are the essence of bondage. Bondage arises from passions being the cause of karmic existence. As it is said, "Bondage is due to passions." Or, one who is free from bondage is like one who is free from bondage. Similarly, "in all ways" - subtle and gross - "cut off" - eliminated - "bondage" - passions - one who has cut off bondage, "drives away" - propels - "sin" - karmic causes - and, like a surgeon removing a thorn, removes the remaining karma, destroys it completely, without any residue. Another reading is "he cuts off the thorn from himself." (10)

To show what he uses to remove the thorn, the text says:

**Commentary:** A person who is fit for liberation is called a "bhavy." He is also called a "dravya." The use of the word "dravya" in the sense of "bhavy" is established by the sutra "dravya-ncha-bhavy-e" in Panini's grammar. Or, a person who is free from passions, which are the essence of "dravya," is a "dravya." Or, a person who has few passions is called a "dravya." It is said that no one is free from passions while dwelling in the sixth and seventh stages of the realm of passions. Can this be said? The answer is that even one who has passions, but restrains them from arising, is similar to one who is free from passions. In that sense, he is free from passions. What is the nature of such a person? The text explains that he is free from the bondage of passions, because passions are the cause of bondage only when they lead to karmic existence. It is said that the state of karmic bondage is due to passions.

Or, he is free from bondage because he is like one who is free from bondage. He is "cut off from bondage" because he eliminates subtle and gross passions. His bondage is cut off. He removes the karmic influx, which is the cause of sin, like a surgeon removing a thorn, and destroys the remaining karma completely. Here, another reading is "he cuts off the thorn from himself."

This means that he cuts off and destroys the eight types of karma, which are like thorns clinging to his soul.

The text then shows what he uses to remove the karmic thorns:

Page #430:
---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states: Ignorance-based vigor repeatedly causes suffering and pain to the soul. As the soul experiences suffering, its inauspicious consequences increase.

**Commentary:** A **Nayanashila** leader is one who guides towards liberation. Here, the term "leader" is derived from the root "ni" with the suffix "trin" according to the **Taachchhelika-trin** grammar. One who leads or guides towards the right path is called a leader or guide. Here, the **Samyak**, **Jnana**, **Darshan**, and **Charitra**-based path to liberation is referred to as the leader, or the **Shruta** and **Charitra**-based Dharma is considered the leader, as it guides the soul towards liberation. The **Tirthankaras** have explained this path as the leader of liberation. Therefore, wise individuals embrace this path and strive through meditation, study, and other efforts. The Sutrakar encourages the soul to ascend the path of meditation, stating that **Balaviry** is rooted in endless births, both past, present, and future, meaning that those with **Balaviry** repeatedly wander through places of suffering like hell, and due to their inauspicious actions and consequences, their inauspiciousness increases. Thus, those who contemplate the suffering nature of the world are drawn towards Dharma and meditation.

**Thanee:** Various abodes exist, but the world is not permanent. This abode is impermanent, there is no happiness here.

**Shadow:** The inhabitants of various abodes will surely abandon them. This abode is impermanent, even with relatives and friends.

**Translation:** The rulers of various abodes will inevitably be removed from their positions. The companionship of relatives and friends is also impermanent.

**Commentary:** Now, addressing the concept of permanence, the text states that those who have abodes are the inhabitants, such as Indra in the celestial realm, the thirty companions of Trayastrimsa, and in humans, the Chakravarti, Baladeva, Vasudeva, and Mahamandala leaders. Similarly, in the animal realm, there are various abodes like the **Yani** and **Chidi** realms, and these abodes are all diverse, ranging from the highest to the lowest and the middle. These inhabitants will surely abandon their abodes, there is no doubt about it. As it is said:

"All abodes, both in heaven and here, are impermanent. The happiness of gods, demons, and humans is also impermanent."

Similarly, the companionship with relatives, friends, and allies is also impermanent. As it is said:

(402

**Sri Viryaadhyayanam**

"For a long time, having enjoyed with relatives, separation from them occurs. Even after enjoying for a long time, there is no satisfaction in worldly pleasures. Even a well-nourished body perishes after a long time. By contemplating for a long time, Dharma alone is the helper." ||1||

Thus, the two "cha"s (in the verse) are used to indicate the impermanence of wealth, grain, bipeds, quadrupeds, body, etc., and to remind of the twelve reflections (including the reflection of being without refuge) and to indicate the meaning of the unsaid. ||12||

Furthermore,

**Commentary:**

Now, the author of the scripture, having indicated the impermanence, says: Those who are in a position or high position are called "sthani" (holders of a position). For example, Indra and his thirty-three companions in heaven are "sthani". Similarly, among humans, Chakravarti, Baldev, Vasudev, Mahamandalik (ruler of a large mandala or vast kingdom), etc., are "sthani" - those who hold high positions. Similarly, one should understand in the context of the Tiryanch (non-human) beings. All the positions in this realm of enjoyment are of different types, superior, medium, and inferior. Their "sthani" - the rulers - will surely abandon them one day, there is no doubt about it. It is said that all the positions - high positions - in heaven and in the mortal world are impermanent, temporary, or for a short time. Similarly, the prosperity, wealth, and happiness of gods, demons, and humans are also impermanent, short-lived. The association and companionship with relatives, family members, and affectionate friends are also impermanent, impermanent. It is said that after living with relatives for a long time, separation from them occurs. Even after enjoying worldly pleasures for a long time, there is no satisfaction. The body, which has been nourished for a long time, also perishes. But if one contemplates Dharma, assimilates it, then it becomes a helper in this world and in the next.

In the present verse, the "cha" is used twice. Its meaning is that there should be a feeling of impermanence in worldly wealth and possessions, such as wealth, grain, bipeds, and quadrupeds. One should understand that they are impermanent. One should practice the twelve reflections, including the reflection of being without refuge. The word "cha" also indicates that one should also know what is not said here.

Thus, the wise one, having understood this, should abandon his greed. He should embrace the noble Dharma, free from all other false doctrines. ||13||

**Shadow:**

Thus, the wise one, having understood this, should abandon his greed. He should embrace the noble Dharma, free from all other false doctrines. ||13||

**Translation:**

Having understood that all the positions mentioned earlier are impermanent and perishable, the wise man should abandon his greed or desire. He should embrace the noble Dharma, free from the influence of other false doctrines.

**Commentary:**

Having understood that all the positions are impermanent, the wise man, who is established in the right conduct, should abandon his greed, his attachment to possessions, his sense of "mine". He should not have any sense of "mine" anywhere. Thus, he should avoid all harmful doctrines. The path to liberation is based on right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct. This is the noble path of the Aryas (the enlightened ones), such as the Tirthankaras. He should embrace this path, follow it, and take refuge in it. What kind of path is it? It is free from all false doctrines.

Page #432:
---------------------------
- The Dharma of the Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra is "Akopito" (unstained), because it is impossible to stain it with its own glory, and it is established in the Angas (that is), or because it is manifested by all Dharmas, its nature, and its practices, being free from any blameworthy duty. ||13||
Commentary: The wise man, contemplating that all things are impermanent, whether they are within his own limits or are the objects of discrimination between the good and the bad, should abandon greed, possessiveness, or attachment towards them. He should never think that this thing is mine, I am its owner. That which is free from all blameworthy Dharmas, from false thinking and conduct, is called the Arya Dharma. It is the Dharma of liberation based on right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, or it is called Arya, the path of the Tirthankaras and other Arya men. The wise man should embrace it, accept it. What is that path? Explaining this, the Sutrakar says that it is unstained, uncorrupted, unaffected by all the false Dharmas of the Kutirthikas, the doctrines of the false believers. It is so glorious and dignified that it cannot be stained by the doctrines of the Kutirthikas, or it is unstained, untouched by any other doctrines or their actions. It is manifested in its pure form, because there is no harmony of any blameworthy duty or action.
Together, with right understanding, listen to the essence of Dharma. The one who has renounced the world, having attained the right understanding, will be liberated. ||14||
Shadow: Knowing with right understanding, or having heard the essence of Dharma.
The one who has renounced the world, having rejected sin, is present. ||
Translation: The virtuous man, engaged in the acquisition of knowledge, etc., in the advancement of the self, having heard from the Guru, etc., with his pure intellect, the essence of Dharma, the true nature of Dharma, should abandon sin.
Commentary: To show how the knowledge of good Dharma comes about, the Sutrakar says: The essence of Dharma, the ultimate truth, is the essence of Dharma. Knowing it, with understanding, how? He shows: With right understanding, with one's own understanding, with specific, insightful knowledge, with knowledge gained through hearing, with knowledge gained through perception, because knowledge is the means of understanding oneself and others, with that, knowing the essence of Dharma, that is the meaning. Or, having heard from the Tirthankaras, Ganadharas, Acharyas, etc., like Ilaputra, or from others, like Chilata Putra, a man knows the essence of Dharma. Or, the essence of Dharma is conduct, he accepts it, adopts it. Having adopted conduct, for the purpose of destroying the karma accumulated in the past, the wise man, endowed with strength, free from attachment, etc., without childish strength, for the sake of increasing virtues, the one who has renounced the world, is present, the increasing result, the rejected sin, the form of sinful conduct, by which he has become the one who has rejected sin. ||14||
And another thing:
Commentary: The Sutrakar explains how a man comes to know good Dharma.
The essence of Dharma, or the true nature of Dharma, is the ultimate truth. How is it known? He says: It is known through intellect, or through one's own specific, insightful knowledge, one's own specific, intellectual knowledge, or through knowledge gained through hearing, through knowledge gained through perception, the essence of Dharma is known, that is the meaning. Or, having heard from the Tirthankaras, Ganadharas, Acharyas, etc., like Ilaputra, or from others, like Chilata Putra, a man knows the essence of Dharma. Or, the essence of Dharma is conduct, he accepts it, adopts it. Having adopted conduct, for the purpose of destroying the karma accumulated in the past, the wise man, endowed with strength, free from attachment, etc., without childish strength, for the sake of increasing virtues, the one who has renounced the world, is present, the increasing result, the rejected sin, the form of sinful conduct, by which he has become the one who has rejected sin. ||14||
(404)

Page #433:
---------------------------
To perform the virtuous study, the virtuous seeker, free from the bonds of attachment, etc., and devoid of childish vigor, progresses towards his excellence, increasing his virtues, and through the results, rejects and abandons sins, becoming pure, sinless, and immaculate.

"Whoever knows the end of his life span, let him learn the teachings quickly." (15)

Commentary: If a wise man knows the time of the end of his life span, he should take up the teachings of Sanlekhana before that time, and proceed on the path of Sanlekhana.

Commentary: The word "upkrama" refers to the decline of life span. If a virtuous person knows about the decline of his life span, he should know the time of his death and before that time, he should be free from anxiety and desire for life, and should take up the teachings of Sanlekhana, Bhaktaparijna (knowledge of the soul), giving up food and water, or giving up both food and water, and Ingitmarana (death by indication), staying in a limited space, and giving up food and water except for physical service. He should learn the method of death through the teachings of "grahana" (acceptance) and practice it according to the teachings of "sevana" (service).

Just as a tortoise gathers its limbs into its body, so too, a wise man gathers his sins through spiritual contemplation. (16)

Commentary: This is an example. Just as a tortoise gathers its limbs, head, etc., into its body, so too, a wise man, a person of good conduct and wisdom, should gather his sins, i.e., keep them under control and not let them affect him.

Page #434:
---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra:

**Verse 16:**

"The Sutra Kritanga Sutra says: 'Papanni' (paap-aani), meaning actions that are sinful, 'Adhyatmana' (adhyaat-ma-na), meaning through meditation on the right path, 'Samaharet' (sama-ha-ret), meaning one should gather them together, and at the time of death, one should gather oneself together through Samyak Sanlekhana (sam-yak san-le-kha-na), and through the death of a wise person, one should gather oneself together."

**Commentary:**

This verse uses the word 'Yatha' (ya-tha) to give an example. Just as a tortoise gathers its neck and other limbs into its body, hiding them and ceasing all activity, similarly, a wise, virtuous, and discerning seeker should abandon their sinful actions, becoming absorbed in spirituality. When the time of death arrives, they should purify their body through Sanlekhana and then abandon it, following the path of a wise person's death.

**Verse 17:**

"Sahare hatthapae ya, manam panchendriyaani ya. Paavakam cha parinaamam, bhaasaadosam cha taarisaam."

**Shadow:**

"Sanharedhastapadanch, manah panchendriyaanich. Papakamcha parinaamam, bhaashaadosamcha taadrusham."

**Translation:**

A virtuous person should keep their hands, feet, mind, and five senses under control. They should refrain from engaging with worldly objects. They should not allow sinful consequences to arise in their mind and should also avoid any flaws in their speech.

**Commentary:**

When a tree is cut down, it becomes devoid of activity, and similarly, a seeker, during the time of Ingini Marana (in-gi-ni ma-ra-na), a period of limited activity, or during the time of Anashan (a-na-shan), a period of fasting, should, like a tortoise, contract their hands and feet, refraining from any actions that cause harm to living beings. They should also withdraw their mind from harmful activities and negative thoughts. They should abandon attachment and aversion towards pleasant and unpleasant sounds and other objects, and control their five senses, including hearing. The word 'cha' (cha) here signifies a collective meaning. They should also abandon the sinful consequences of their actions, both in this life and the next, and avoid any flaws in their speech. A virtuous person, remaining silent in mind, speech, and body, should attain the rare state of true restraint and follow the path of a wise person's death, seeking the complete destruction of their karma.

**Verse 18:**

"Anumaanam cha maayam cha, tam padinnaay pandie. Saataagaaravanihue, uvasante nihe chare."

**Translation:**

A wise person, who has conquered their ego and attachment, should remain steadfast in their practice, like a merchant who has reached his destination, and should continue to live in a state of detachment.

**Commentary:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of remaining steadfast in one's practice, even after achieving a certain level of spiritual progress. Just as a merchant who has reached his destination continues to manage his business, a wise person should continue to practice their spiritual disciplines, remaining detached from the world and its allurements.

Page #435:
---------------------------
**Sri Viryaadhyayanam** (Shadow) - A wise person should know and avoid pride, arrogance, and illusion. 
**Translation** - A wise and virtuous person should not indulge in pride, arrogance, and illusion. These have great negative consequences. Knowing this, he should stay away from them, not desire worldly pleasures, and remain calm by abandoning anger and other vices.
**Commentary** - If someone invites a virtuous person who is striving for self-control with offerings and respect, the author says that he should not show off his greatness. 
Even if a person is honored by a Chakravarti or others, he should not have even a little pride. What to speak of more? Even if a person is facing death, has a body scorched by severe austerities, and thinks, "Oh, I am great," he should not have even a little pride. Similarly, even a little illusion is not acceptable, what to speak of a lot? In the same way, anger and greed should also be avoided. Knowing the poisons and their consequences through knowledge and rejection, he should abstain from them. 
Another reading is "Aimaanam cha Maayam cha, Tam parinnaaya pandie." Knowing that excessive pride is painful, like that of a Subhumi Chakravarti, he should avoid it. This means that even if a person with attachment sometimes experiences pride, he should make it fruitless. The same applies to illusion. 
Another reading is "Suyam me ihamegesi, Eyam veerasya veeriyam." The strength with which a great warrior defeats the enemy army in the midst of a fierce battle is not true strength. True strength is the power with which one conquers lust, anger, and other vices. This is the strength of a great man. I have heard this saying from the Tirthankaras and others in this very world, in this human birth. 
Another reading is "Ayatatam suadaaya, Evam veerasya veeriyam." The goal of liberation is vast and unending. Having grasped this goal, the path of right faith, knowledge, and conduct, he strives with the strength of fortitude to conquer lust, anger, and other vices. This is the strength of a hero. It was said, "What is the heroism of a hero?" This is how it is explained. 
Furthermore, the term "Saataagauravam" refers to the quality of being comfortable with suffering. He is not attached to it. He is calm, having conquered the fire of anger. He is indifferent to sounds and other objects, both favorable and unfavorable. He is free from attachment and aversion. He is free from illusion, which is the cause of suffering in the world. He is also free from pride and greed. Such a person should practice self-control. 
Therefore, a wise and courageous person who is engaged in the great vows should be like this, even at the time of death or at any other time. To emphasize the importance of non-violence, the author says:
"Uddhamahe tiriyam va je paana tasathaavara. Savvatha niratim kujja, Santi nivvaana mahiya." (3)
This verse is not found in the Sutras or the commentaries. It is written here because it is found in the commentary. This is the meaning. (18)
**Commentary on the Commentary** - A virtuous person who is striving for self-control, who is enthusiastic and eager, is invited by someone with offerings and respect. The author says that he should not show off his greatness there. 
Even if a person is honored by a Chakravarti or others, he should not have even a little pride. What to speak of more? Even if a person is facing death, has a body scorched by severe austerities, and thinks, "Oh, I am great," he should not have even a little pride. Similarly, even a little illusion is not acceptable, what to speak of a lot? In the same way, he should not indulge in anger and greed. He should abstain from the poisons and their consequences by knowing them through knowledge and rejection. Here, another reading is "Aimaanam cha Maayam cha, Tam parinnaaya pandie." This means, "O wise and intelligent person, excessive pride is painful, like that of a Subhumi Chakravarti."

Knowing that this happened with the Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra, abandon it. This means that if pride arises in a state of attachment and restraint, immediately defeat it, that is, suppress it. Similarly, suppress Maya, etc. The text "Suyamme Ihamegesiṁ Eyaṁ Virasyā Viriyam" is found here. This means that it is not true valor to conquer the enemy army with the army in the midst of the battle, in the front. The true valor of a man, a great man, is the self-control by which lust, anger, etc. are conquered. I have heard this in this world, or in human birth, from the words of Tirthankaras and other great men. Or, "Ayataṭuṁ Suādāya, Evaṁ Virassā Viriyam" is found here as a variant reading. Its meaning is that Ayata is indicative of liberation. Because there is no end to its dwelling, its abode. That liberating meaning, or the path of liberation, which is right faith, knowledge, and conduct, is called Ayata. The man who, having grasped this well, displays the valor to conquer lust, anger, etc., with the strength of fortitude and courage, is the true valor of that hero. The question that was asked earlier, what is the valor of a valiant man, has been explained in this way. Desire or craving for pleasure and enjoyment is called Satagaurava. A virtuous person should not strive for it. He should conquer the fire of anger and remain cool and calm. That is, if favorable or unfavorable words, etc., come before him, he should not be attached to them, nor should he hate them, but because he is self-controlled, he should remain aloof from them. That by which the animal kingdom is killed is called Niha. It is Maya. A virtuous person should remain separate from Maya, illusion. Similarly, one should know that a virtuous person is free from pride and devoid of greed. In this way, he should follow restraint. At the time of death, or at any other time, a virtuous and wise person should be full of valor and devoted to the great vows. He should be absorbed in their observance. Of these five great vows, non-violence is very important. Therefore, to expound it, the Sutrakar says, "Udamehe Adi." This verse is not found in the Sutra Darshanas, the manuscripts of the Sutra, but it is found in the commentary. Therefore, it is mentioned here. Its meaning is clear.
"Paṇe Ya ṇaivaāejjā, Adinnapi Ya ṇādaē. Sādiyāṁ ṇ Musāṁ Būyā, Es Dhammē Busīmaō ||19||"
Chāyā - "Prāṇāñca Nātipatayet, Adattaṁ Pi Ca Nādādit.

Anuvāda - "This is the dharma of a Vasy, a self-controlled man, that he should not kill any living beings. Nor should he take anything that has not been given. He should not speak falsely, nor should he deceive."

## Shri Veeryadhyayanam - Commentary

**All beings cherish their lives. Therefore, a virtuous person should not harm any living being. They should not even accept a blade of grass used for cleaning teeth that was not given by another. They should not speak falsely with deceit, because false speech is used to deceive others. Therefore, it cannot exist without deceit and trickery. Thus, deceit is the root cause of falsehood. The meaning is that the Sutra-maker prohibits deceitful false speech that is used to deceive others. However, they do not prohibit falsehood spoken to protect the secrecy of restraint. For example, when asked by a hunter if they have seen any deer, it is not considered blameworthy to say that they have not seen any deer. The aforementioned Sutra-charitra-based nature is Dharma. Here, "Vusimao" is a Chandas usage, indicating knowledge, etc., and those who possess it. Or, it signifies "Vashya-Atmavashga-Jiteindriya," one who is self-controlled and has conquered their senses, and is connected to Dharma.**

**Verse 20:**

**Chhaya:** "Atikramanthu Vacha, Manasaapi na Prarthayet. Sarvatah Samvrito Danta Aadanam Susamaharet."

**Translation:** A virtuous person, who is completely restrained and has conquered their senses, should not desire to cause pain to any living being through speech or mind. They should carefully observe the restraint they have adopted.

**Commentary:** "Apicha - causing harm to living beings is a violation of the Mahavratas. A virtuous person should not desire such a violation, nor should they despise others due to pride. By prohibiting both speech and mind, the prohibition of bodily violation becomes natural. Thus, a virtuous person should not commit any sin like killing, etc., through actions, words, or approval. They should be completely restrained, both externally and internally, with conquered senses and self-discipline. They should adopt the 'Aadanam' - the means to liberation - which is based on right understanding, etc., and should be well-established, free from vices, and should 'Ahare' - accept and embrace it."

**Commentary:** "The violation of living beings - causing them pain - is a violation of the Mahavratas. A virtuous person should not commit such a violation, nor should they despise others due to pride, neither through speech nor through mind. By prohibiting both speech and mind, the prohibition of bodily violation becomes natural. Thus, a virtuous person should not commit any sin like killing, etc., through actions, words, or approval.

They should adopt the 'Aadanam' - the means to liberation - which is based on right understanding, etc., and should be well-established, free from vices, and should 'Ahare' - accept and embrace it."

**Verse 21:**

**Chhaya:** "Kritancha Kriyamanacha, Agamishyaccha Papakam. Sarvam Tannaanujaanantyatmaguptaa Jiteindriyaah."

**Translation:** Those who are self-controlled and have conquered their senses do not approve of any evil, whether it is done, being done, or will be done.

Page #438:
---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra - Translation

**The men who keep their souls pure from sinful actions and who have conquered their senses, do not approve of the sins committed, being committed, or to be committed by others.**

**Commentary:**  
Those who are virtuous, do not approve of the sinful actions committed by others, who are like uncivilized people, whether those actions were committed in the past, are being committed now, or will be committed in the future. They do not approve of these actions with their mind, speech, or body. They do not partake in the enjoyment of the fruits of these actions. Even if others commit sinful actions for their own benefit, such as beheading an enemy, or killing a thief, the virtuous do not approve of these actions. They do not consider them to be praiseworthy. If someone offers them impure food, they do not accept it. 

**Who are these men?** The Sutra explains: Those who have kept their souls pure by restraining their minds, speech, and bodies from unskillful actions, and who have conquered their senses, such as hearing, are the ones who do not approve of sinful actions.

**Verse 22:**

**Those who are great, valiant, and have not seen the truth of the Dharma, their actions are impure and will bear fruit in all ways.**

**Commentary:** 
Some people may be considered learned, but they have not truly understood the Dharma. They may be skilled in grammar and logic, but they have not attained true knowledge. True knowledge is not merely about grammar and logic. It is about understanding the true nature of reality. 

The Sutra says: 

"Even if someone is deeply immersed in the study of scriptures, they will not attain the true nature of reality if they are not wise. Just as a person may be skilled in tasting different flavors, but they may not be able to taste the true flavor of a substance for a long time."

Even if someone is valiant and powerful, if they are not wise, their actions will be impure and will lead to suffering.

##  Sri Viryaadhyayanam

This verse shows that even though some people are revered by the world due to their qualities like renunciation, and even though they are valiant warriors, they are still deficient in the true knowledge of the principles. This is because they are not truly right, their state is not right, and they lack the ability to see the right. This means they are of false vision. Any effort they make in austerities, donations, study, restraint, and rules is impure, impure-making, and actually leads to the bondage of karma. This is because their intention is not pure and it is motivated by desire for results. This is like the treatment of an incompetent physician, which does not cure the disease but only aggravates it. Their efforts are accompanied by their fruit - the bondage of karma. Thus, all their actions, austerities, and practices are only for the bondage of karma. ||22||

Now, the author speaks about the virtuous and valiant.

**Commentary:** Those who do not know the secrets or essence of the Buddha Dharma, and who consider themselves very arrogant and learned based on their knowledge of dry grammatical arguments, are devoid of the true knowledge of the ultimate reality. Therefore, they are called ignorant and unwise. Mere knowledge of grammar without rightness does not lead to the understanding of the true nature of things. It is said that even though a person is proficient in delving deep into the scriptures and explaining them, he still does not know the true nature of things. Just like a proud person, or a spoon, even though it remains immersed in various delicious substances for a long time, it does not know the taste of their essence. Or, a person with childish strength is called unwise. The word "bhaga" denotes worship or respect. Those who are worthy of worship and respect by people are called "maha-bhaga". They are renowned in the world. Those who are capable of breaking through the enemy's forces and defeating them are called "su-ghada".

The meaning is that many people are learned in grammar and other subjects, and are worthy of respect in the world due to their qualities like renunciation, and are also valiant warriors, but they do not know the true nature of things. The author expresses this. What is not truly right is called "asamyak". The state or nature of "asamyak" is called "asamyaktva". Those who are possessed by "asamyaktva" are of false vision. They are childish - ignorant in terms of religion. The effort made by these people of false vision in austerities, donations, study, restraint, and rules, is impure, impure-making, and actually leads to the bondage of karma. This is because it is devoid of the right intention and is motivated by desire for results. Just like the treatment of an incompetent physician does not cure the disease but only aggravates it, similarly, the efforts of these ignorant people are accompanied by the bondage of karma. Thus, all the actions, austerities, and practices performed by those of false vision are only for the bondage of karma. Now, the author speaks about the virtuous and valiant.

**Je ya buddha maha-bhaga, vira sammatta-dansino.
Sudham tesim parakkantam, aphalam hoi savvaso.** ||23||

**Shadow:**
**Ye cha buddha maha-bhaga vira samyaktva-darsinah. Sudham tesham parakrantam aphalam bhavati sarvashah.**

**Translation:** Those who are Buddhas - knowers of the true nature of things, maha-bhaga - worthy of respect, and vira - capable of breaking the bonds of karma, and who have right vision, their austerities and other actions are pure. They are for the destruction of karma and for the attainment of liberation.

**Commentary:** These are some self-enlightened ones, like the Tirthankaras and their disciples, or those who have been enlightened by the Buddhas, like the Ganadharas and others. They are "maha-bhaga" - worthy of great respect, "vira" - valiant, capable of breaking the bonds of karma, and they shine with qualities like knowledge. They are also "samyaktva-darsinah" - knowers of the ultimate reality.

---------------------------
The Sutra of the Sri Sutra Kritanga, which is the supreme effort of the Bhagavans, is pure, free from obstacles, and fruitless in relation to the bondage of karma, as it is dedicated to the eradication of karma. This is because the effort of the Samyak Drishtis is primarily focused on restraint and austerity, and restraint is the form of non-attachment, while austerity bears the fruit of karma eradication. Thus, it is said: "Restraint leads to the cessation of inflow, and austerity bears the fruit of knowledge."

Commentary: Those who are self-enlightened, like the Tirthankaras, and their disciples, like the Ganadharas, who have attained enlightenment through the knowledge of the enlightened, are worthy of great reverence. They are capable of destroying karma, and are adorned with qualities like knowledge. They are the knowers of the true nature of things, and their efforts in austerity, study, restraint, and rules are pure. This means that they are not tainted by the blemishes of desires, anger, and other afflictions. Therefore, they are fruitless in relation to the bondage of karma, and are only for the eradication of karma. This is because all the efforts of the Samyak Drishtis are primarily focused on restraint and austerity. Restraint is the form of non-attachment, and austerity bears the fruit of karma eradication. Therefore, the scripture says: "Restraint leads to the cessation of inflow, and austerity bears the fruit of knowledge."

Those who have renounced the world, even if they are born into a great family, are not pure in their austerity if they seek praise or honor for it. A virtuous person should keep their austerity secret so that others who are inclined to give charity do not know about it. They should never boast about it.

Commentary: It is also said that those who are born into great families, like the Ikshvaku dynasty, who are renowned in the world for their valor and other qualities, and whose fame is widespread, are not pure in their austerity if they perform it for the sake of praise, honor, or recognition. Similarly, any austerity that is performed but is not known to others, such as those who are inclined to give charity, should be kept secret by the seeker of liberation. Therefore, they should not boast about themselves, as in saying, "I am born into a noble family, and I am now engaged in austerity to purify my body." By revealing themselves in this way, they do not make their practice fruitful.

The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** is a complete guide to diet. A sadhu should practice reducing their food intake by one mouthful at a time. They should eat less than their hunger. Similarly, they should practice **avomodary** (moderation) in their consumption of drinks, and other utensils. It is said that those who eat little, speak little, sleep little, and possess few possessions are even worshipped by the gods. A virtuous sadhu should speak little and only speak what is beneficial. They should never speak **viktha** (words that could lead to the corruption of their character).

Now the Sutrakar explains the meaning of **avayodary** (moderation). A sadhu should calm their anger and other passions and become forgiving. They should conquer their greed and other desires and become **anatur** (free from anxiety). They should control their senses and mind and become **jiteindriya** (master of their senses). Therefore, it is said that the **pravrajya** (renunciation) of one who has not destroyed their **kashayas** (passions) and whose mind is not under their control is only for the sake of survival or to fill their stomach. Therefore, a sadhu should always strive to follow **sanayam** (self-control) and be free from **griddhi** (worldly attachments).

**Jhan Jogam Samahat, Kayam Viusej Savvaso. Titikkham Parmam Naccha, Ayokkhaae Parivvaejjassi Ttibemi. ||26||**

**Shadow:** Meditation, yoga, and concentration, completely abandon all actions. Knowing that forbearance is supreme, I say that one should renounce for liberation.

**Translation:** A sadhu should accept meditation, yoga, and concentration as their practice and restrain their mind, speech, and body from all evil actions. It is beneficial to endure trials and tribulations. Knowing this, one should follow **sanayam** until they attain liberation.

**Commentary:** The words "Jhan Jogam" etc. refer to meditation, which is characterized by the restraint of the mind, such as contemplation of dharma. Yoga is the specific activity of the mind, speech, and body in that meditation. Having properly adopted this meditation yoga, one should abandon the body, which is prone to unskillful actions. One should abandon all actions, including those of the hands, feet, etc., that cause suffering to others. One should know that forbearance, which is the endurance of trials and tribulations, is supreme and the most important for self-welfare. One should follow **sanayam** until all karmas are destroyed. This is what I say. The word "iti" signifies the end of the verse. The word "bravimi" (I say) is to be understood as in the previous verses.

**Commentary:** Restraining the mind from evil objects and contemplating dharma is called meditation.

One should not allow their hands, feet, etc., to engage in actions that cause suffering to others.

The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra says: Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, Chandala, and Vokkas, Esika, Vaishya, and Shudra, these are the four types of beings who are attached to the beginning (Aaram bha). 

Those who are attached to possessions (Parigrah) have increasing enmity towards other beings. 
Those who are attached to desires (Kama) that are born from the beginning (Aaram bha) are not liberators from suffering (Dukkha).

Page #445:
---------------------------
Religious studies cause violence, they are harmful and destructive to all living beings. Therefore, their animosity towards living beings increases. This is the action part of the next story. A Brahmin born from a Shudra woman is called a Nishad. A Brahmin born from a Vaishya woman is called an Ambashtha. A Nishad born from an Ambashtha woman is called a Vokkas. Those who hunt and search for deer and elephants for meat are called Vyagra and Hastitapas Aishik. Or those who search for roots and tubers for their food, or those who, by various means, search for food and drink, objects of enjoyment, and means of enjoyment, are all called Aishik. Kalopjivi - those who make a living through the arts, are called Maya Pradhan Vaishya or Shudra, those who farm and those of the Ahirs caste are called by different names. ||2||:
Whatever is taken from all sides, is called parigraha. Having attachment to bipeds, quadrupeds, wealth, grain, gold and silver etc. is parigraha. Those beings who are engrossed in or greedy for parigraha, who are attached to the beginning and the end, as mentioned in the previous story, their sinful and unbearable karma increases greatly. They cannot destroy those karmas even in hundreds of births, 'Veram Tesim Pavatu' is found in some places. This means that whoever oppresses or destroys any being, suffers in the world for hundreds of times in the same way. Just as the enmity of Jamdagni and Kritavirya etc. increases to their sons and grandsons. Why does this happen? While solving this, it is said - they are attached to the enjoyment of the senses, the beginning and the end, the killing etc. of the beings who are attached to the beginning and the end. Therefore, such beings who are attached to the objects of enjoyment, who are attached to the beginning and the end, who are bound by parigraha, cannot escape the eight types of karmas that cause suffering. ||3||

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra with Commentary - English Translation

**Commentary:**  The act of killing or destroying any of the ten types of living beings is called *Aghāt* (violence). It is death. The rituals performed after death, such as cremation, offering water, and ancestral offerings, are called *Aghāt Kṛtya* (acts of violence). Those who perform these rituals, the son, wife, nephew, etc., who are attached to worldly pleasures, take away the wealth earned by the deceased with great difficulty. As a Guru once instructed a king: "O King! Those who have earned wealth, married wives, and protected them, after their death, others rejoice, are satisfied, and adorned with ornaments, play with their wealth and wives. But the deceased sinner, who earned wealth through *Sāvadya* (sinful) and *Pāpa* (evil) actions, is tormented in the world due to the fruits of his actions, suffering various tortures in the form of cutting, piercing, etc." ||4||

**Commentary:** The Sutrakar (author of the Sutra) points out that those who enjoy the deceased's wealth are not his refuge. 

**Verse 5:**
*Māyā pitā bahusā bhāyā, bhaja putrā ya orasā. Nālam te tava tāṇāya, luppantasas sakammunā.* ||5||

**Shadow Verse:**
*Chāyā - Mātā, pitā, snuṣā bhrātā, bhāryā putrāścaura sāḥ. Nālam te tava trāṇāya, lapyamānasya svakarmaṇā.*

**Translation:**  When a being is suffering and tormented due to the consequences of his own sins, neither his mother, father, daughter-in-law, brother, wife, nor children can provide him with refuge.

**Commentary:**  "Mātā" (mother) refers to the mother, "Pitā" (father) refers to the father, "Snuṣā" (daughter-in-law) refers to the son's wife, "Bhrātā" (brother) refers to the sibling, "Bhāryā" (wife) refers to the spouse, and "Putrāścaura sāḥ" (children) refers to the children. All these, including the mother, father, and others like the father-in-law, are not capable of providing refuge to the one who is being tormented by his own actions in the cycle of Samsara (world). If they cannot provide refuge in this world, how can they provide refuge in the next? There is an example of this: A butcher named Kāla Saukarika had a son named Sulasa. He was a friend of Abhayakumar. His family members pleaded with him to kill animals, but he did not harm any living being. Instead, he struck his own hand with an axe. ||5||

**Commentary:** The mother, father, daughter-in-law, brother, wife, and children, as well as all other relatives, are not able to provide refuge to the one who is suffering in the world due to his own actions. They cannot save him from suffering in this world, so how can they hope to provide refuge in the next world? This is illustrated by the example of Sulasa, the son of a butcher named Kāla Saukarika. He was a friend of Abhayakumar. His family members begged him to kill animals, but he did not harm any living being. Instead, he struck his own hand with an axe.

**Verse 6:**
*Eyam aṭuṁ nimmamo
Sapehāe, nirahaṁkāro,
Paramāṇu gāmiyam.
Carebhikkhū jiṇāhiyam.* ||6|| 418

**Translation:**
This is the path of non-violence,
Free from attachment and ego,
Walking the path of the atom,
Following the teachings of the Jina. ||6|| 418

**Shadow:** This is to be observed, it is in accordance with the ultimate goal.
_ The monk, free from attachment and ego, should follow the path prescribed by the Jinas. _
**Translation:** Understanding the above statement, right faith, knowledge, and conduct are the path to liberation. Knowing this, the monk, free from attachment and ego, should follow the path of Dharma, characterized by detachment.
**Commentary:**  Furthermore, those who are devoid of Dharma, being tormented by their own actions, have no refuge in this world or the next. This has been stated before.  The wise man, understanding this, and knowing that right faith, knowledge, and conduct are the cause of the ultimate goal - liberation or self-control - should follow them.  Discarding all this, and because the word ending in "ktva" implies an action in the past, it requires another action. Therefore, it is said:  He is free from attachment because he has renounced attachment to external and internal objects. He is free from ego because he has renounced ego, which arises from past wealth, birth, etc., or from austerity, study, and gain.  Therefore, he is free from attachment and aversion.  Such a monk should follow the path prescribed by the Jinas, the path that is related to the Jinas, the path that is prescribed by them.
**Commentary Meaning:**  Those who are devoid of Dharma, being tormented by their own actions, have no refuge in this world or the next. This has been stated before.  The wise man, understanding this, and knowing that right faith, knowledge, and conduct are the cause of the ultimate goal - liberation or self-control - should follow them.  He should not have attachment to external and internal objects.  Grammatically, the word ending in "ktva" implies an action in the past, therefore it requires another action.  Therefore, the author has stated it in this way.  The virtuous person should not have ego arising from past wealth, birth, etc., or from austerity, study, and gain, but should be free from attachment and aversion.  Living in this way, he should follow the path prescribed by the Tirthankaras.
**Shadow:**  Giving up wealth, sons, relatives, and possessions.
Giving up internal sorrow, he should wander without attachment.
**Translation:**  A person should give up wealth, sons, relatives, possessions, and internal sorrow, and wander without attachment, free from all desires and attachments.
**Commentary:**  Furthermore, the mind that has understood the nature of the world, knowing what is to be known, should give up what?  Giving up wealth, material possessions, and sons.  The word "sons" is used because there is greater affection for them.  Giving up relatives, and giving up possessions, which are the form of attachment and ego.  In the figure of speech, "anta" means "ending," so "antanga" means "difficult to give up" or "destructive."  "Antaka" means "destructive" or "going within oneself."  Giving up such sorrow, such distress.  Giving up the stream of karma, which is characterized by delusion, non-restraint, negligence, and passions, and which is the door to karma.  Another reading is "chichcha na nantaga soyam," which means "going within."

The Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra states that one should abandon sorrow and attachment to the world, becoming "nirapeksha" (free from attachment) to sons, wives, wealth, grain, gold, etc., and strive for liberation (amoksha) by practicing restraint (samyama) in all directions. It is also said:

"Those who are attached to possessions are deceived, but those who are free from attachment cross the ocean of samsara without hindrance. Therefore, one should be free from attachment in all matters." (1)

"Those who are attached to pleasures fall into the terrible ocean of samsara, but those who are free from attachment cross the terrible forest of samsara." (2)

Commentary:

A person who is pure in understanding the nature of samsara, who knows the objects of knowledge (vedya), and who is aware of the nature of things, should abandon the attachment to material possessions, wealth, and family, which are sources of suffering and destruction. They should also abandon the inner torment of ego (mamta) and the karmic inflows of false beliefs (mithyatva), non-restraint (avirati), carelessness (pramada), and passions (kashaya). According to another reading, they should also abandon the inner sorrow (shrota) or grief. Such a person should not even desire sons, wives, wealth, grain, or gold, and should strive for liberation through the practice of restraint until they attain it.

Humans have a strong attachment to their children, so the example of a son is used here. The word "na" (ण) is used here in the sense of a figure of speech.

It is said that those who are attached to possessions are deceived, but those who are free from attachment cross the ocean of samsara without hindrance. Therefore, a person who understands the essence of the teachings (pravachana) should be completely free from attachment.

Those who are attached to pleasures fall into the terrible ocean of samsara, but those who are free from attachment cross the terrible forest of samsara.

Earth, fire, air, grass, trees, seeds, egg-born, womb-born, moisture-born, sweat-born, and sprout-born are all living beings.

Commentary:

A person who has renounced the world (pravrajita) and has a pure mind (suvrata) should strive to practice the vows of non-violence (ahimsa), etc. The verse "Pudhvi u" etc. is meant to explain the concept of non-violence.

Earth-bodied beings (prithvi kayika) are of different types, such as subtle, coarse, large, and small. Fire-bodied, air-bodied, and water-bodied beings are also of different types. Plant-bodied beings (vanaspati kayika) are of many types, such as grass (trina) like kusha, and trees (vriksha) like mango and ashoka, which bear seeds (beeja). Seeds include rice, wheat, and barley. These are all one-sensed beings (ekendriya).

Egg-born (motaja) beings include elephants, rhinoceroses, etc. Womb-born (jarayuja) beings include cows, humans, etc. Moisture-born (rasaja) beings are born from milk, butter, etc. Sweat-born (sansweda ja) beings include flies, mosquitoes, etc. Sprout-born (udbhija) beings include creepers, etc.

Since beings of unknown types are difficult to protect from harm, they are described in detail here.

Page #449:
---------------------------
## Dharma Study Commentary - 

A renunciate-initiated Sadhu, dwelling in the highest vows, should strive in the practice of the great vows of non-violence, etc. To illustrate the fame and expression of non-violence, the Sutra-maker says two verses, beginning with "Puḍhavīu". 

The beings of the earth element are diverse, differing in their subtle-gross, sufficient-insufficient, and insufficient-insufficient categories. Similarly, the beings of the water element, fire element, and air element are also diverse, like the beings of the earth element. 

The Sutra-maker now briefly explains the diversity of beings of the plant element: Kusha and Vacchaka, etc., grasses, mango and Ashoka, etc., trees, rice, wheat, and barley, etc., seeds - all these five are one-sensed beings. 

Now, the scholar explains the sixth, the animal element: Birds like the Shakun and the Baz, the house-cuckoo, and reptiles that crawl are oviparous. Elephants, Sarabha, etc., born as babies are viviparous. Cows and humans, etc., born wrapped in the womb are uterine. Beings born from curd, sour-gruel, etc., are rasa-born. Lice, bedbugs, etc., born from sweat are sweat-born. Grasshoppers, frogs, etc., are born from moisture. 

It is very difficult to protect these beings without knowing their differences. Therefore, their differences have been explained here. 

**Verse 9:**

**Shadow:** "From these six elements, the wise should know. With mind, body, and speech, one should not begin, nor take possession."

**Translation:** The wise and discerning person should understand these six elements as beings and should not begin, nor take possession of them with mind, speech, and body.

**Commentary:** "By these" - the aforementioned six elements, including the mobile, immobile, subtle, gross, sufficient, and insufficient categories - one should not begin, nor take possession. This is the connection. The wise, with their knowledge and understanding, should recognize these and, with their knowledge of rejection, should avoid beginning and taking possession of beings with mind, speech, and body, which are harmful to life.

**Verse 10:**

**Shadow:** "False speech, sexual intercourse, and taking what is not given. Weapons, etc., in the world, the wise should know."

**Translation:** The wise should know that false speech, sexual intercourse, and taking what is not given, as well as weapons, etc., in the world, are all harmful.

Page #450:
---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Translation:**

Speaking falsehood (Mṛṣāvāda), engaging in sexual misconduct (Abrahmacarya), attachment (Parigraha), and taking what is not given (Adattādāna) are all like weapons in the world and are the cause of karmic bondage. Therefore, wise and discerning monks should know these through the knowledge of discernment (Jñā-parijñā).

**Commentary:**

The Sutra-maker now speaks about the remaining vows. Speaking what is not true is called Mṛṣāvāda. Wise and knowledgeable ascetics should abandon these through the knowledge of rejection (Pratyākyāna-parijñā). Sexual misconduct is called "Bahirdh", attachment is called "Avagraha", and taking what is not given is called "Ayācita". Or, the word "Bahirdh" encompasses both sexual misconduct and attachment. The terms "Avagraha" and "Ayācita" refer to taking what is not given. These, like falsehood, etc., are like weapons because they cause suffering to living beings and are the cause of eightfold karmic bondage. Therefore, wise and discerning men should know these through the knowledge of discernment and abandon them through the knowledge of rejection.

**Om Om**

**Translation:**

Deception (Palikunjan), greed (Bhajan), anger (Sthandila), and pride (Ucchāyana) are the causes of karmic bondage in the world. Wise and discerning monks should abandon these after knowing their nature.

**Commentary:**

Furthermore, the Sutra-maker shows that even the observance of the five great vows is futile for one who is attached to passions (Kṣāya). Therefore, to make these vows fruitful, the suppression of passions is necessary. "Palikunjan" is the practice of deception, where actions are twisted and distorted. "Bhajan" is greed, where one desires everything. "Sthandila" is anger, where one becomes confused and unable to distinguish between right and wrong. "Ucchāyana" is pride, where one becomes arrogant due to birth, etc. The plural form is used because there are many types of pride, such as pride in birth, etc. The "ca" (च) indicates the different types of passions or their collective nature. Each of these passions should be abandoned. For example, one should abandon deception (Palikunjan), greed (Bhajan), anger (Sthandila), and pride (Ucchāyana). The order of the Sutra is not a fault, as it is due to the complexity of the subject. Or, it could be that deception is the root of greed, and greed is the root of anger, etc. Therefore, the Sutra emphasizes the abandonment of passions. The Sutra-maker further states that these passions (Palikunjan, etc.) are the causes of karmic bondage in the world. Therefore, wise and discerning monks should know these through the knowledge of discernment and abandon them through the knowledge of rejection.

Page #451:
---------------------------
Study of Dharma Commentary - For a human being, the five great vows are futile and useless if they have passions present. Therefore, to make the five great vows successful and meaningful, one should restrain and obstruct passions. The sutra-maker shows the way. That by which a human being's actions become crooked and twisted, abandoning simplicity and becoming full of cunning, is called *palikunchana*. This is the name of illusion. That by which the soul is attracted everywhere, is called *bhajan*. This is the indicator of greed, upon the arising of which the soul becomes devoid of the discrimination of good and bad, and becomes like a *sthaḍiṁla*, becoming impure. That is called *sthaḍiṁla*. This is the name of anger, by which the soul becomes arrogant due to caste, etc., and becomes *uttāna*. It becomes arrogant due to ego. That is called *ucchaya*. This is the indicator of pride. The word *mana* is masculine according to grammar, but due to the use of *chāndasa* or *ārṣa*, it is used here in the neuter gender. There are many places of *mada* like caste, etc., therefore the plural is used here. The *chākara* used here is for the purpose of indicating the internal difference, or it is in the sense of a collection. Here, *dhūnaya-dhūna* (throw away, finish, or abandon) should be combined with each, should be joined. For example, *dhūna* the illusion, abandon it, abandon greed, etc. Here, the order of illusion, greed, anger, and pride is not in order. The reason for this is not a fault due to the peculiarity, diversity, or specialness of the sutra, or because attachment is difficult to abandon, and greed happens only with illusion - first there is illusion, then there is greed. Therefore, illusion or greed is described first. The sutra-maker also tells about the abandonment of passions. According to that, in the world, there is bondage due to actions like illusion, etc. Knowing this, a wise person should abandon them.
*Dhoyaṇam rayaṇam ceva, batthīkammam virayeṇa. Vamaṇanjana palīmantham, tam vijam parijāṇiya.* ||12|| *Chāyā* - *Dhāvanaṁ rañcanañcaiva, bastikarma virecanam. Vamanāñjanaṁ palīmantham, tadvidvān parijāṇiyāt.* || Translation - Washing of hands, feet, etc., dyeing, *bastikarma*, *virecana*, vomiting, and eye-ointment, etc., all these actions destroy restraint. Therefore, a wise person should abandon them knowing this.
Commentary - Again, mentioning the subsequent qualities, he says - *dhāvanaṁ* - washing of hands, feet, clothes, etc., *rañjanaṁ* - dyeing, also of the same, the *chākara* is for the purpose of collection, the *evakāra* is for the purpose of holding, similarly *bastikarma* - enema, *virecana* - purgative, *vamanaṁ* - vomiting, *añjanaṁ* - eye-ointment, etc., all these, even the body-care, etc., which are *sanayama-palīmanthakārī* (destroyers of restraint), are in the form of a hindrance to restraint, a wise person should know their nature and their consequences, and reject them. ||12|| Also - ... 
Commentary - Again, the sutra-maker, mentioning the subsequent qualities, says that washing of hands, feet, clothes, etc., dyeing, *bastikarma* - taking an enema, *virecana* - taking a purgative, *vamana* - vomiting after taking medicine, *añjana*

---------------------------
The Sutra Kritanga Sutra states that applying surma (kohl) to the eyes, as well as other bodily adornments and rituals, are detrimental to restraint. Wise monks, knowing their nature and consequences, should abandon them.

The use of fragrant substances on the body, garlands of flowers, bathing, teeth cleaning, possessions, and engaging in worldly activities are all causes of sin. Wise monks, knowing this, should remain separate from them and abandon them.

The commentary explains that fragrant substances include kohl, garlands include those made of jasmine, bathing refers to washing parts or the whole body, teeth cleaning refers to using a twig of kadamba wood, possessions refer to accepting things with attachment, and worldly activities include engaging in sexual misconduct with women of divine, human, or animal realms. All these actions are causes of bondage and lead to the cycle of birth and death. Wise monks, knowing this, should abandon them.

The Sutra Kritanga Sutra also states that food offered with a specific purpose, purchased food, food borrowed from others, food brought by householders, impure food contaminated by half-ascetics, and food that is unsuitable for any reason are all causes of worldly attachment. Wise monks, knowing this, should abandon them.

The commentary explains that food offered with a specific purpose refers to food prepared for donation to monks, purchased food refers to food bought and received, food borrowed from others refers to food taken for the sake of monks, food brought by householders refers to food brought by householders for monks, impure food refers to food contaminated by half-ascetics, and unsuitable food refers to food that is impure for any reason. Wise monks, knowing this, should abandon all these types of food and remain detached from the world.

Page #453:
---------------------------
## Dharma Study

**Commentary:**

The food, drink, etc. that is arranged for the Sadhu is called **Uddeshik**. The food that is purchased for the Sadhu is called **Krit**. The food that is borrowed from someone else for the Sadhu is called **Pamity**. Here, the "cha" is in the sense of a collection, and the "eva" is in the sense of a concept. The food that the householder brings for the Sadhu is called **Ahat**. If the **Adhakarm** comes into contact with even a particle of impure food, the pure food becomes impure. Such food is called **Pray** or **Purti**. What more can be said? If the food is impure due to any fault, it is **Aneshniya** (inedible) and **Agrahi** (unacceptable). A wise Muni, free from desire, knowing that this is the cause of birth and death in the world, should abandon it.

**Verse 15:**

"Aasuni Makshiragam cha, Gidduvadhayakammagam. Uccholana cha Kakkam cha, Tam Vijjam Parijaneya."

**Translation:**

"The consumption of Aasuni, the desire for beauty, the attachment to pleasing objects like sounds, the act of harming living beings, the careless washing of hands and feet with cold water, and the rubbing of the body with powders, are all causes of worldly increase. Knowing this, the Sadhu should abandon them."

**Commentary:**

The consumption of ghee or other special foods, or the use of Rasayana (rejuvenating substances), which makes a person strong and healthy, is called **Aasuni**. Or, **Aasuni** can also refer to praise, because a person of low character becomes puffed up with pride when they hear praise. The consumption of **Aasuni**, the application of collyrium (eye-paint) for beauty, the indulgence in pleasures like sounds and tastes, the act of harming living beings, the act of causing harm or injury to others, and the careless washing of hands and feet with cold water, and the rubbing of the body with powders, are all causes of bondage. A wise Muni, knowing this, should abandon them.

## Dharma Study Commentary - Here, the meaning of "parapatra" is the vessel of a householder. A muni should not eat or drink water from that vessel because there is a fear that the vessel may be washed with water containing past or future karma, that it may be stolen, destroyed, or broken by falling from the hand. Alternatively, it is prescribed for the stable, contemplative sadhus to keep vessels. Therefore, they keep vessels because their cupped hands are porous. Hence, even the vessel of the stable muni's hand is a "parapatra". He should not eat from it, nor drink water from it. Alternatively, the Jina-kalpi and other munis do not keep vessels. Their cupped hands or "anjali" are their vessels. Their hands or "anjali", which are free from holes and tightly closed, are their vessels. For the Jina-kalpi muni, all other vessels are "parapatra". They consider them to be against their vows of restraint. Therefore, out of fear of breaking their vows, they should not eat or drink water from such vessels. Even though sadhus are without clothes, they should not wear the clothes of a householder out of fear of past or future karma, or the fear of being washed with impure water, being stolen, or being destroyed. Alternatively, the Jina-kalpi muni is without clothes, for them all clothes are "paravastra". Therefore, they should not wear clothes. Thus, in summary, it is against the vows of restraint for a sadhu to eat from a "parapatra", etc. Knowing this through knowledge and understanding, he should abandon it through the knowledge of rejection.

**Verse 21:**

"Aasandi, Paliyanke ya, Nisijancha gihatare. Sampucchaanam saranam va, tam vijam parijaaniya."

**Commentary:**

"Aasandi, Paliyanke, and Nisijancha in the house of a householder. Sampucchaanam, Saranam va, the wise one should know and abandon these."

**Translation:**

A sadhu should not sit on an "Aasandi" (a type of seat) or a "Paliyanke" (a type of bed). He should not sleep on a bed. He should not sit in a narrow alley between two houses or inside a householder's house. He should not inquire about the well-being of a householder, nor should he remember his past playful activities during his life as a householder. All these things are distractions in the world. Knowing this, he should abandon them.

**Commentary:**

"Aasandi" is a specific type of seat, and because of its general nature, it encompasses all types of seating arrangements. Similarly, "Paliyanke" is a specific type of bed. Also, he should avoid sitting in the middle of a house or between two houses, or sitting on a seat, out of fear of violating his vows of restraint. As it is said:

"Deep holes are these, difficult to cross for the living beings. Lack of secrecy is a violation of celibacy, women are also a cause of doubt."

And so on. Also, in the house of a householder, he should not inquire about their well-being, nor should he inquire about his own body parts (Sampucchaanam), nor should he remember his past playful activities. The "vidvan" (the wise one) should know and abandon these things through knowledge and understanding, and through the knowledge of rejection.

---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

It is said that a bed or a cot is called a *paryanka* or *palang*. Sleeping or sitting in a narrow space within a householder's house or between two houses is a cause of violation of restraint. Therefore, a monk should abandon these. It is said that *gambiramance* or *khat* etc. have deep holes, therefore living beings are not visible in them, but their presence is suspected. Their transcription is not possible and being located within a householder's house or between two houses, the protection of celibacy is not possible. There is also a suspicion of female contact there. Asking about the well-being of the family of the householder, wiping the limbs of one's body, and remembering the previous games and enjoyed objects of enjoyment - all these are for the sake of evil, for the downfall of the soul. Therefore, the wise monk, knowing the truth of the matter, should abandon all these by the knowledge of rejection. ||21||

**Vanda-puyana**

Just as there are desires in this world and in all the worlds, a wise monk should know them. ||22||

**Translation:** Fame, glory, praise, respect, and all worldly pleasures are the cause of worldly wandering. Knowing this, a wise monk should abandon them.

**Commentary:**  Furthermore, fame is the characteristic of bravery in carrying out many battles and conflicts, glory is achieved through giving, praise is born from high birth, austerity, and hearing scriptures, and respect is given by the kings of gods and demons, emperors, powerful kings, Vasudeva, etc., and the same respect is given by them in the form of clothes, etc. Knowing all this, a wise monk should abandon fame, glory (praise, etc.) by understanding their true nature. ||22||

**Commentary Meaning:** The fame or reputation that arises in the world from winning a battle in a very large war is called fame. The fame that is obtained by giving a lot of charity is called glory. The fame that is obtained in the world by being born in a high caste, by practicing austerity, and by studying scriptures is called praise. The respect that is given by Indra, the king of the demons, the emperor, Balarama, Vasudeva, etc., in the form of bowing, salutation, clothes, etc., and all the worldly desires - a monk should abandon all these by knowing their true nature and by understanding their true nature.

**The monk who carries out his duties**

The monk who carries out his duties, food and drink, and the same, should know that the giving of food to others is the cause of worldly wandering. ||23||

**Shadow**

A wise monk should know this. ||23||

**Translation:**

**Dharma Study Translation -** A monk should not give to another monk any food or water that would cause his restraint to become corrupted or destroyed. It increases transmigration. A wise muni, knowing this, should abandon it.

**Commentary -**  "Kinchanyat" -  "Yena" - by which food or water, or by which means, "Tathavidhena" -  by which means, "Iha" - in this world, a monk would perform or sustain his restraint, famine, disease, fear, etc., "Tathavidham" -  "Shuddha" - pure, "Dravyakshetrakalabhaavaapekshaya" -  in relation to substance, field, time, and condition, "Anupridanam" - giving, "Anyasmai Sadhave" - to another monk, "Samyamayatra Nirvahanasamarttham" - capable of performing restraint, "Yadva" - or, "Iman" - this, "Nirvaheyat" - he would perform, "Nirvahayet" - he would sustain, "Asarataamaapaadayet" - he would cause it to become worthless, "Tathavidham Asanam Panam Va Anyadva" - such food, water, or anything else, "Tathavidham Anusthanam" - such practice, "Na Kuryaat" - he should not do, "Anupridanam" - giving, "Grihasthanam" - to householders, "Paratirithikanam" - to those who have gone to other religions, "Swayuthyanam Va" - or to those of his own group, "Samyamopaghatakam" - harmful to restraint, "Na Anushilayet" - he should not practice, "Tadevat Sarvam Jnaparijnayaya Jnatva Samyak Parihareyat" - knowing all this by knowledge and understanding, he should properly abandon it. ||23||

**Commentary Meaning -**  A monk should take food and water that is pure and appropriate in relation to substance, field, time, and condition, in normal circumstances. He should also give such pure and appropriate food and water to other monks for the performance of restraint. However, he should not give food or water that would cause his restraint to become worthless, corrupted, or destroyed. He should also not perform any other actions that would destroy restraint. He should not give such impure food, etc., to any householders, those who have gone to other religions, or those of his own group. A monk should abandon these things, considering them to be harmful to restraint.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Verse 25:**

He who speaks, does not speak, nor does he desire to speak what is harmful. He avoids speaking what is deceptive, and speaks only after careful consideration.

**Commentary:**

A Muni who is skilled in the art of speech, even while delivering a discourse on Dharma, is like one who does not speak. He does not utter words that cause pain or sorrow to anyone. He does not speak deceitfully. He speaks only after careful thought and consideration.

**Explanation:**

The verse emphasizes the importance of mindful speech in Jainism. A true practitioner of Dharma should avoid speaking words that are harmful, deceptive, or motivated by self-interest. Instead, they should speak with careful consideration, ensuring that their words are beneficial and truthful.

**Further Explanation:**

The commentary elaborates on the verse, explaining that a Muni who is skilled in speech should avoid speaking in a way that:

* **Causes pain or sorrow:** They should not utter words that hurt others' feelings or cause them distress.
* **Is deceptive:** They should not speak with the intention to deceive or mislead others.
* **Is motivated by self-interest:** They should not speak in a way that benefits themselves at the expense of others.

Instead, they should speak with the intention of promoting Dharma and helping others. They should carefully consider the impact of their words before speaking, ensuring that they are beneficial and truthful.

**The commentary also highlights the importance of avoiding:**

* **Speaking when someone else is speaking:** A Muni should not interrupt or try to overshadow others' speech.
* **Speaking with arrogance:** They should not boast about their knowledge or wisdom.
* **Speaking with the intention to deceive:** They should not use their words to manipulate or exploit others.

The commentary concludes by emphasizing the importance of careful consideration before speaking. A Muni should always think about the potential consequences of their words before uttering them.

---------------------------
"Dharma study is not something that causes suffering." He said this after thinking. Therefore, it is said that a sadhu should first observe with their intellect, understand thoughtfully, and then speak. 

"That speech which, when spoken, causes regret, should not be spoken. That which is hidden should not be spoken. This is the command of the Nirgrantha." (26)

Commentary: There are four types of speech: (1) truth, (2) falsehood, (3) truth mixed with falsehood, and (4) falsehood mixed with truth. Of these, the third type of speech, truth mixed with falsehood, is one that is partly true and partly false. For example, someone might say, "Ten children were born or died in this village." It is possible that the number of children born or died could be less or more than ten. Therefore, due to the discrepancy in the number, this statement is both true and false. 

A sadhu should not speak in such a way that, due to the fault arising from that speech, they suffer in future births, or experience regret later, thinking, "Why did I speak like that?" 

The point is that even the third type of speech, mixed with falsehood, is harmful. What then to say of the second type of speech, falsehood, which contradicts the entire meaning? Even the first type of speech, truth, is not to be spoken if it causes suffering to beings, as it is connected to fault. The fourth type of speech, falsehood mixed with truth, is not used by the wise, and therefore should not be spoken. 

Even truth can sometimes cause harm. The author says, "For example, 'Kill him, he is a thief,' 'Cut the crops,' 'Subdue the oxen of the chariot,' etc. These are true statements, but they cause harm." 

Or, "That which is hidden, that which is concealed by people with great effort, even if it is true, should not be spoken." 

"This command" - this teaching - is of the Nirgrantha Bhagwan Mahavira. (26)

Page #462:
---------------------------
##  The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**But violence is the main thing, it is the producer of faults. Even if something is true, it should not be said if people try hard to conceal it - keep it hidden. This is the command of the Nirgrantha Prabhu, it is his teaching.**

**Holavaayam, Sahivaayam, Tumum Tumanti Amanunnam**

**Translation:** A Sadhu should not address anyone with harsh or degrading words, nor should they address anyone as a friend, etc. They should not address anyone by their gotra, such as "O Vasishtha Gotriya!" or "O Kashyap Gotriya!" to please them. They should not address someone older than them as "you" or "thou". A Sadhu should never speak words that are unpleasant, displeasing, or offensive to others.

**Commentary:**  "Hola" is a type of speech called "Holavaad", similarly, "Sakhe" is a type of speech called "Sakhivaad", and addressing someone by their gotra is called "Gotravaad", such as "Kashyap Gotriya" or "Vasishtha Gotriya". A Sadhu should not speak in this manner. Similarly, "Tumum Tumanti" is a disrespectful singular pronoun used for a plural subject, and "Amanunnam" refers to words that are unpleasant to the mind, or any such words that are humiliating. A Sadhu should never speak such words.

**Goyavaayam Cha No Savvaso Tam Na**

**Holavaade Sakhivaadam, Gotravaadancha Nee Vaadet.**

**Tvam Tvamiti Amanunnam Sarvasha Stanna Vartate.**

**Translation:** A Sadhu should not speak in a way that is disrespectful, nor should they use the words "you" or "thou" for someone who deserves a plural pronoun. They should never speak words that are unpleasant to others.

**Commentary:** Addressing someone with a degrading term is called "Holavaad". Addressing someone as "O friend!" is called "Sakhivaad". Addressing someone by their gotra to please them, such as "O Vasishtha Gotriya!" or "O Kashyap Gotriya!" is called "Gotravaad". A Sadhu should not speak in this manner. They should not use disrespectful words like "you" or "thou" for someone who deserves a plural pronoun. A Sadhu should never speak words that are unpleasant to others.

**Akusilae**

**Suhruvaa**

**Commentary:** A Sadhu should always remain "Akusilae" - free from bad conduct, and should not associate with "Kusilae" - those who have bad conduct, because they have "Suharupa" - pleasant but harmful influences. A wise Sadhu should be aware of this and remain vigilant.

**Bhaye. Viuu.**

**Commentary:** As stated in the previous verse, "Pasatthosanna Kusilae Santhavo Na Kil Vattae Kaum" - those who associate with bad people will not be good. Therefore, a Sadhu should always remain "Akusilae" - free from bad conduct, and should not associate with "Kusilae" - those who have bad conduct, because they have "Suharupa" - pleasant but harmful influences. A wise Sadhu should be aware of this and remain vigilant.

**Sayabhikkhu, Neva Samsaggiyam Thathuvassagga, Padibujheej**

**Akusilah Sada Bhikkhu Naiva Samsargitam Bhajet.**

**Sukharupaa Statropasargaah Pratibudhyet Tadvidwaan.**

**Translation:** A Sadhu should always remain "Akusilae" - free from bad conduct, and should not associate with "Kusilae" - those who have bad conduct, because they have "Suharupa" - pleasant but harmful influences. A wise Sadhu should be aware of this and remain vigilant.

**Commentary:** As stated in the previous verse, "Pasatthosanna Kusilae Santhavo Na Kil Vattae Kaum" - those who associate with bad people will not be good. Therefore, a Sadhu should always remain "Akusilae" - free from bad conduct, and should not associate with "Kusilae" - those who have bad conduct, because they have "Suharupa" - pleasant but harmful influences. A wise Sadhu should be aware of this and remain vigilant.

Page #463:
---------------------------
A monk who is devoted to the study of Dharma and has good conduct should not become a *kushila*, nor should he associate with *kushila*s. The association with *kushila*s leads to two types of harm: 1) *sukhrupa* (desire for pleasure) and 2) *gauravasvabhava* (pride). These harms are detrimental to *samyama* (self-control) and lead to *upasarga* (obstacles). 

*Kushila*s often say things like, "What harm is there in washing one's hands, feet, and teeth with impure water?" or "Dharma does not exist without a body." Therefore, one should protect the body, which is the foundation of Dharma, by any means necessary, including taking *ardhakarma* (food with minor impurities), wearing shoes and an umbrella, etc. It is said, "Even if a small amount of harm brings great benefit, one should accept it. This is the mark of a wise person." 

It is also said, "The body is united with Dharma, and it should be protected with great effort. Just as water flows from a mountain, so too does Dharma flow from the body." 

When a *kushila* says things like, "Nowadays, people have weak bodies and little patience for *samyama*," those with weak minds are influenced by their words. Therefore, a wise and discerning person should understand this and avoid the association of *kushila*s, which is harmful to the spiritual path.

It is also said, "Do not stay in another's house when there is an obstacle. A monk should not laugh excessively at the play of a village girl."

Page #464:
---------------------------
The Sutra Kritanga Sutra Translation - A Sadhu should not sit in the house of a householder without any hindrance, without any unavoidable cause like illness, etc., and should not play the corrupt games of village boys. He should not laugh immoderately.
Commentary - There, the Sadhu, having entered a village, etc., for the purpose of begging, etc., should not sit in the house of a householder, that is, in a stranger's house. This is the rule. The Sutrakar now shows an exception to this - 'not by any hindrance', that is, hindrance is the lack of ability, and that may be due to old age, illness, or fear. If there is such a hindrance, then there is no fault in sitting there. Or, if someone is a seeker of liberation, has a good companion, and has been authorized by the Guru, and if the Guru has given permission to do so, and if it is necessary to give religious instruction to someone, then there is no fault in sitting in the householder's house. The games of the village boys are called 'grama-kumarika'. The Sadhu should not engage in laughter, amorous gestures, touching, embracing, etc., or play games like marbles, etc. He should not laugh excessively, exceeding the limit. The Sadhu, fearing the bondage of the eight types of karma, including knowledge-obscuring karma, should not laugh, exceeding the limit. And the Agama says - "O Lord! How many karmic bonds does a being make when he laughs or is curious?" Gautama asked this question to Lord Mahavira. In reply, the Lord said - "Gautama! He makes seven or eight karmic bonds."
The Sadhu should not be curious about things that are pleasant, beautiful, and desirable, such as the sounds, etc., of the Cakravati kings, or the pleasures of the senses, clothes, ornaments, songs, Gandharvas, vehicles, etc., or the wealth of the gods, etc. He should be diligent in the observance of restraint. He should be free from negligence in his conduct, such as begging, etc., and should endure even when afflicted by persecutions and afflictions.
Commentary - And 'urala' are those who are generous, beautiful, and pleasing, such as the sounds, etc., of the Cakravati kings, or the pleasures of the senses, clothes, ornaments, songs, Gandharvas, vehicles, etc., or the wealth of the gods, etc. The Sadhu should not be curious about these things, whether he has seen them or heard about them.

## Dharma Study

**30.**  A person who is not attached to anything, who is not bound by anything, should strive to attain self-control. They should practice self-control diligently, focusing on the fundamental and secondary virtues. They should be diligent in their conduct, such as begging for alms, and not be attached to food or other pleasures. When faced with insults and hardships, they should endure them with equanimity, knowing that they are a means to purify karma.

**31.**  When someone is struck, they should not become angry. When someone speaks harshly, they should not become agitated. They should endure it with a peaceful mind and not create any disturbance.

**32.**  When a desire is fulfilled, one should not become attached to it. One should remain detached and mindful. One should strive to learn from the wise and follow the teachings of the Buddhas.

Study the Dharma. Those who are capable of eradicating the roots of karmic actions, who are seekers of the perfect knowledge (Kevala Jnana), who are courageous, patient, and have conquered their senses, do so.

Commentary: The desire to listen to the teachings of the Guru, or the service to the Guru, is called Shushrusha. One who performs this service should serve the Guru. The Sutra-kar describes the two main qualities of the Guru: He is Su-prajna (possessing excellent wisdom), meaning he is knowledgeable about his own philosophical principles (Swa-samaya) and the principles of others (Para-samaya), and is a scholar of the scriptures (Geetarth). He is also Su-tapaswi (possessing excellent austerity), meaning he practices both external and internal austerities. A seeker of liberation (Paraloka-arthi) should serve such a knowledgeable and righteous Guru. As it is said:

"One becomes a partaker of knowledge, firm in vision and conduct. Those who are fortunate do not abandon the Guru's abode."

The Sutra-kar describes those who follow this path: They are "Veera" (heroes), meaning they are capable of destroying karmic actions, are tolerant of hardships, are patient, and are not disturbed by afflictions. They are "Dhira" (steadfast), meaning they are guided by wisdom and are on the path to liberation. They are "Aapt-prajna-anveshi" (seekers of perfect knowledge), meaning they are free from attachment and aversion and seek the perfect knowledge (Kevala Jnana) as taught by the omniscient. They are also seekers of self-knowledge (Aatma-prajna-anveshi), meaning they seek the knowledge of the self and the welfare of the self. They are "Dhritiman" (possessing fortitude), meaning they have a love for restraint and are able to bear the burden of the five great vows due to their fortitude. Their austerity leads them to a good path (Su-gati). As it is said:

"He who has fortitude, has austerity; he who has austerity, has a good path. Those who have fortitude, austerity is indeed difficult for them."

They are also "Jita-indriya" (those who have conquered their senses), meaning they have conquered their senses through the victory over attachment and aversion. Such disciples or Gurus who serve others are distinguished by these qualities.

Page #468:
---------------------------
English translation preserving Jain terms:

The Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra is like a Jain scripture in hand. Those who control the attachment and aversion towards sensual objects and are Jitendriya (conquerors of the senses) reside in the Gurukula (preceptor's abode) and serve the Gurujan (preceptors). Or, they possess the same characteristics as mentioned above about the Guru.

The present discourse explains the specialty of Dhrti (fortitude). It is said that the one who possesses Dhrti, their Tapashcharana (spiritual austerities) succeeds. The one who practices Tapa (austerities) attains the highest state. The one who lacks Dhrti finds it difficult to succeed in their Tapa.

Gihe divamapasanta, purisadaniyanaraḥ |
Te vira bandhanummukkā, navakankshanti jiviyaṃ || 34 ||

Translation: The persons who do not see the lamp (of knowledge) in the house, they are the ones who accept Pravrajya (renunciation). They are the brave ones, liberated from bondages, and do not desire the life of non-restraint.

Commentary: Those who possess the aforementioned qualities, the scripture explains about them. 'Gihe' means in the household life, or in the bondage of the household. 'Divam' means the lamp, i.e., the attainment of scriptural knowledge, or the island (dvipa) that provides solace in the ocean of Samsara, i.e., the attainment of the Charitra (right conduct) preached by the Omniscient. 'Apasanta' means those who do not obtain or see this lamp or island. They are the 'Naraḥ', the persons, who, due to their superior nature of Dharma, are worthy of being accepted (adaniya) by the Mumukshus (aspirants of liberation). Or, 'adaniya' means those who seek the welfare, i.e., the path of right faith, knowledge, and conduct, for the liberation of these persons. Such persons, who are thus characterized, are specifically called 'Vira', the brave ones, as they are liberated from the bondage of attachment to son, wife, etc., and 'na avakankshanti jiviyaṃ', they do not desire the life of non-restraint.

Page #469:
---------------------------
This study is characterized by these qualities, or the separation - distinction - elimination of gods, etc. Here, the word "male" is used for the sake of distinction. It is not used for the distinction of women. The meaning of "male-given" used here is that the path to liberation, which is the form of liberation or right description, knowledge or character, is "male-given" because it is accepted by men who are desirous of their own welfare. It is accepted by men. It is in the form of liberation or the path to liberation. Therefore, the word "male-given" is appropriate here. According to grammar, the word "male-given" has the "ac" suffix with the meaning of "male". Those who are of this nature, they alone destroy their eightfold karma, are heroes, and are free from the seductive attachments of sons, wives, etc., and from internal bonds. They do not desire a life of unrestraint or the desire to sustain life.

The translation is good.

**Tīkārtha -** Here, in the context of sensory objects, the word comes first and touch comes last. Therefore, from the acceptance of these two, the intervening objects should also be considered accepted here. Do not be greedy for words, forms, smells, tastes, and touches that are pleasing to the virtuous mind, and do not hate those objects that are unpleasant to the mind. He should not be involved in sinful practices. From the beginning of this study, the things that have been told in the form of prohibitions are forbidden - prohibited because they are contrary to the principles of the omniscient ones. Those that have been ordained are contrary to the principles of the heretics - the false-believers, and therefore are transcendental - excellent, superior dharma - dharma-approved. What the false-believers have said a lot in their principles should not be followed because it is contrary to the principles of the omniscient ones.

- The *Sri Sutra Kritanga Sutra* says: "Excessive pride and illusion, the wise one should know them. All the objects of desire, the Muni should seek liberation." ||36||
Commentary: - The wise Muni, knowing excessive pride, excessive ego, illusion, deceit, worldly pleasures, should renounce them and seek liberation.
Explanation: - The Sutra-maker, through the prohibition of the main objects of prohibition, speaks of the desire for liberation. Excessive pride, great pride, and the word "cha" (also) indicates its companion, anger, and illusion, and the word "cha" (also) indicates its effect, greed. The wise man, knowing all this, should renounce it through the knowledge of renunciation. Similarly, knowing all the "objects of desire" - wealth, taste, and beauty - as the cause of the world, he should renounce them. Renouncing them, the "Muni" (saint) should seek "liberation" - the destruction of all karma, or the specific region of space. Thus, the meaning of the end, "I say" is as before. ||36||
The ninth study of Dharma is complete.

The Great Meditation
The tenth Great Meditation, listen to this human Dharma, this meditation, O monks! The unpledged monk, having attained meditation, should wander among beings without attachment. ||1||
Commentary - The wise one, having contemplated the Dharma, listens to this meditation, which is straight and leads to liberation. The unpledged monk, having attained meditation, should wander among beings without attachment.
Translation - The great possessor of wisdom and knowledge, the omniscient Lord Mahavira, has declared the Dharma, which is straight, simple, and leads to liberation through meditation. O disciples! Listen to it. The unpledged monk, who has no desire for the fruits of his austerities, having attained meditation, should practice pure restraint, free from violence.
Commentary - This verse is connected with the previous verse, which states that one should strive for liberation by abandoning all worldly attachments (Grantha 5500). The Lord, who has attained divine knowledge, has declared this, and this is what will be explained now. Who is the one who has declared this? - 'The wise one' - 'mati' means contemplation, knowledge of all things, and the one who possesses this is the wise one, the omniscient one. Here, the use of the special epithet 'matimaan' refers to the Tirthankara, and by implication, it also refers to the Veer Vardhaman Swami. What has he declared? - 'Dharma' - the Dharma of the scriptures and conduct. How? - 'Having contemplated' - having known through omniscience, he speaks of the Dharma based on things worthy of being explained. Or, having contemplated the listener, he asks, "For whose sake is this worthy of being understood? What kind of person is this? From where has he come? What kind of vision has he attained?" Thus, having considered all this, the devotees of the Dharma think that the Lord speaks of the Dharma, considering each person's point of view, so that everyone can understand it in their own language and doubts can be removed. What kind of Dharma does he speak of? - 'Straight' - not crooked, describing the true nature of things as they are. Not like the Sakyas, who, fearing the fault of creating destruction and attachment, have accepted the impermanence of everything and have accepted the existence of beings. Similarly, they accept plants as inanimate and do not cut them themselves, but they teach others to cut them. Similarly, they do not touch gold and silver themselves, but they buy and sell it through others. Similarly, the Sankhyas, fearing the fault of bondage to karma and the absence of liberation, accept everything as unchanging, uncreated, stable, and eternal, and they rely on the absence of birth and death. Thus, the Lord has declared the Dharma, free from all such cunning and deceit. Similarly, it is understood correctly - liberation, the path to it, or the self, is made suitable, established by this Dharma. This is the Dharma that he has declared. Or, he has declared the Dharma, and that meditation, which is the meditation on the Dharma, etc. Sudharmaswami says, "Listen to this Dharma, or meditation, which has been taught by the Lord." For example, the one who is unpledged has no desire for worldly or otherworldly rewards, and he performs austerities without any desire. The monk who is a mendicant, who is a seeker of the truth, is the one who is truly virtuous. He is the one who has attained the Dharma and the meditation on the Dharma. Similarly, the one who is unattached has no attachment to beings, and he wanders among them without any attachment. Or, the one who is unattached, who is free from the flow of karma, who is free from the cause of karma, should wander well, should wander perfectly. Or, he should wander among those things that are unattached, that are like unattached things, such as knowledge, etc. Or, the cause, the reason, the suffering, is unattached, and he should practice restraint, striving for the highest good, without causing suffering to anyone. ||1||
Commentary - This verse is connected with the previous verse, which states that the virtuous should abandon all worldly pleasures and engage in the practice of liberation. The omniscient Lord Mahavira, as will be explained further, has declared the Dharma. Now, we will explain this. Inquiring about the qualities of Lord Mahavira Swami, one asks, "How is the Lord?"

---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states that the Lord is **matiśālī** (wise).  **Mati** is the knowledge of all substances, and those who possess such knowledge are called **sarvajña** (omniscient) or **kevalajñānavan** (possessing perfect knowledge), **matimaan** (wise) or **matiśālī** (wise). Although there have been many **kevalajñāna** (omniscient) holders, the epithet **matimaan** is used here with an extraordinary meaning, denoting a **tīrthankara**. Among the **tīrthankaras**, Lord Mahavira is the most recent. Therefore, this epithet refers to him here. Lord Mahavira narrated the **śrutacāritramūlaka dharma** (religion based on scriptures and conduct).

How did he do it? In response, it is said that he, knowing the nature of the substances of the world through **kevalajñāna** (omniscience), took from them the substances worthy of being taught and narrated the religion. The Lord, addressing the first man to hear the religion, said that this man could be capable of accepting which substance. Who is he? To which deity or guru is he devoted? In whom does he have faith? What philosophical doctrine does he follow? Having determined these facts, he narrated the religion.

Alternatively, it is the opinion of those who practice religion that the Lord addressed each of us individually when he narrated the religion. The religious teachings given by the Lord are transformed into the language of all beings at the same time.

What kind of religion does the Lord preach? In response, it is stated that the Lord preaches a **ṛju-avakra** (straight, not crooked), simple religion, i.e., he describes the true nature of things as they are. He does not preach like the Buddhists and other proponents of other doctrines. Buddhists accept all substances as **kṣaṇika** (momentary), which leads to two flaws in their doctrine: **kṛtanāśakīya** (destruction of what has been done) and **akṛtābhyāgama** (arrival of what has not been done).

Therefore, they accept the doctrine of **santānavāda** (theory of continuity). They consider plants to be **acetan** (inanimate), **chetana-rahit** (without consciousness), and **prāṇa-rahit** (without life). They do not cut them themselves, but they preach about cutting them, etc. Although they themselves do not touch **kāṛṣāpaṇa** (copper coin), **rupaya** (silver coin), **paisa** (coin), **hiraṇya** (gold), **suvarna** (gold), etc., precious metals, they have them collected by others and have them bought and sold.

Similarly, **sāṅkhya** proponents consider all substances to be **apracyuta** (indestructible), **vināśa-rahit** (without destruction), **anutpanna** (unborn), **utpatti-rahit** (without birth), **sthira** (stable) in nature, and **nitya** (eternal). By believing this, **karma** (action) does not bind, and **mokṣa** (liberation) is not achieved. Fearing such a flaw, they believe that all substances appear or disappear. This belief is **kauṭilya-bhāva-kuṭilita** (deceitful). Lord Mahavira, avoiding such deceitful sentiment, narrated a religion that is **avakra** (straight), **sarala** (simple), **tathya** (true), and **satya** (truthful), by which the soul is **samyak** (properly) established in **mokṣa** (liberation) or the path to **mokṣa** (liberation), made fit to progress towards it. That is called **dharma** (religion). Alternatively, the Lord narrated the **dharma** (religion) and its **samādhi** (concentration), i.e., **dharma-dhyāna** (meditation on religion), etc.

**Shri Sudharma Swami** says to his followers: "You people listen to the **dharma** (religion) or **samādhi-sādhanā** (practice of concentration) that Lord Mahavira taught. The man who does not desire worldly and otherworldly happiness as the fruit of his **tapascaraṇa** (austerity) is truly a **bhikṣu-upajīvī-bhāva-bhikṣu** (true ascetic). He is the one who...

---------------------------
Sri Samadhyayan has assimilated the fundamental principle of Dharma Samadhi-Dharma, which is the practice of Dharma. It is free from the root cause of karma. Conduct that is based on the root cause of violence towards beings is called nidana, and it is free from nidana because it is free from violence towards beings. It is free from the practice of savadya-sinful rituals. It is always engaged in the practice of complete restraint, or one meaning of anidana-bhuta is anashrava-bhuta or free from asrava. Thus, it is free from the causes of virtuous actions. It is constantly striving in that direction. Or, one meaning of anidana-bhuta is anidana-sad-dasha-jnanadi, in which it is engaged in virtuous endeavors. One meaning of nidana is the cause or reason for suffering. It is free from the cause of suffering. It does not cause suffering for anyone. It is always engaged in restraint.

**Verse 2:**

**Original:**

उड्ढे अहेयं तिरियं दिसासु, तसा य जेथावर जे य पाणा। हत्थेहिं पाएहिं य संजमित्ता, अदिन्नमन्नेसु य णो गहेजा ॥२॥ छाया - ऊर्ध्वमस्तिय॑ग्दिशासु, त्रसाश्च ये स्थावरा ये च प्राणाः ।
हस्तैः पादैश्च संयम्य, अदत्त मन्यैश्च न गृह्णीयात् ॥

**Translation:**

In the upward, downward, and sideways directions, and in all other directions, those who are trembling and those who are stationary beings, one should not cause them suffering by controlling one's hands, feet, etc. One should not take what has not been given by others.

**Commentary:**

The acts of violence towards beings, etc., are the causes of karma. Violence towards beings is of four types, based on the differences in substance, field, time, and feeling. Here, the field of violence towards beings is being discussed. It is said that all violence towards beings, when performed, is done in the upward, downward, and sideways directions, depending on the knowledge of the performer. Or, it is done in the three realms of the upward, downward, and sideways directions, and in the eastern, etc., directions, and in the intermediate directions. Substance-based violence towards beings is as follows: those beings who tremble, who are perceived as trembling, are those with two senses, etc. Those who are stationary are the earth, etc., stationary beings. The "cha" here is used to indicate the difference in their own nature. Or, it indicates time-based violence towards beings. It is done during the day or night. "Pranas" are beings. Feeling-based violence towards beings is as follows: one should not cause suffering to these aforementioned beings by binding them with one's hands and feet, as this is a symbolic representation. Or, one should not cause them suffering by deceiving them. If one were to bind the hands and feet of these beings and harm them while their body is restrained, one should be restrained in all mental, verbal, and physical actions, including breathing, exhaling, coughing, sneezing, yawning, and natural functions, and should maintain mental concentration. One should not take what has not been given by others. This is the explanation of the third vow. Because of the prohibition against taking what has not been given, the acquisition of possessions is prohibited. The prohibition against sexual intercourse is also useless, because it is not acquired without being taken. Because of the instruction to practice all vows perfectly, false speech is also eliminated.

Page #474:
---------------------------
In the Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra, causing pain to living beings at night is called Kala Pranatipat. Bhava Pranatipat is as follows: binding the hands and feet of these aforementioned living beings or causing them pain in any other way falls under this. One should not harm these living beings while keeping one's hands, feet, and body restrained. The word 'cha' used here indicates that one should follow the Bhava Samadhi with restraint in all of these: inhalation, exhalation, coughing, sneezing, passing of wind, and mental, verbal, and physical actions. One should not accept things that are not given by others. This is the explanation and teaching of the third vow. Here, the prohibition of accepting things not given (Adattadan) also implies the prohibition of possession (Parigraha). Without the feeling of possession (Aparigrahitha Bhava), one cannot enjoy any object. Therefore, the prohibition of possession here also implies the prohibition of non-chastity (Abrahmacharya). Due to the teaching of the proper observance of all vows, the prohibition of false speech (Asat Bhashan) also naturally arises here.

**Verse 3:**

**Chhaya:** One who has transcended doubt in the well-explained Dharma (Suyakkhaya Dhamme Vitigicchati), and who is like a self-controlled person (Laadhe Chare Ayatule Payasu) among living beings (Prajasu). 
**Translation:** One who has transcended doubt in the well-explained Dharma, which is based on the scriptures and conduct, and who is like a self-controlled person among living beings, should not engage in actions that lead to the accumulation of karma (Ayam Na Kujja Iha Jiviyatthi), nor should a well-practiced monk (Sutavassi Bhikkhu) engage in the accumulation of possessions (Chayam Na Kujja).

**Commentary:**

The verse explains the importance of knowledge, vision, and meditation (Jnana Darshan Samadhi). The well-explained Dharma, based on the scriptures and conduct, is known by the virtuous (Suyakkhaya Dhamme). This indicates the knowledge and meditation mentioned earlier, as the well-explained Dharma cannot be understood without specific knowledge. The one who has transcended doubt (Vitigicchati) is free from confusion and doubt, and has no desire for worldly things. This indicates the vision and meditation mentioned earlier. The one who sustains the body with proper food (Laadhe Chare Ayatule Payasu) is a well-practiced monk who has renounced worldly desires. Such a monk should follow restraint (Chare) and consider all living beings as equal to himself (Atmatulya). This is the essence of the verse.

The verse also mentions that one should not engage in actions that lead to the accumulation of karma (Ayam Na Kujja Iha Jiviyatthi). This refers to the accumulation of karma through actions, thoughts, and words. The verse also mentions that one should not engage in the accumulation of possessions (Chayam Na Kujja). This refers to the accumulation of wealth, possessions, and material things.

The verse concludes by saying that a well-practiced monk (Sutavassi Bhikkhu) should not engage in the accumulation of possessions (Chayam Na Kujja). This is because the accumulation of possessions leads to attachment and suffering.

**Chhaya:** Just as I do not like suffering (Jah Mama Na Piyam Dukkha), so too do all living beings (Eameva Savvajivaanam). One who does not kill (Na Hanai) or cause harm (Na Hanavei) and who considers all beings equal (Samamanai) is a true monk (Te Na Samano).

**Translation:** Just as I do not like suffering, so too do all living beings. One who does not kill or cause harm and who considers all beings equal is a true monk.

**Commentary:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of compassion and non-violence. It states that just as we do not like suffering, so too do all living beings. Therefore, we should not kill or cause harm to any living being. We should consider all beings equal and treat them with kindness and compassion. This is the true path of a monk.

The verse concludes by saying that one who does not kill or cause harm and who considers all beings equal is a true monk (Te Na Samano). This is because such a person has developed true compassion and has transcended the cycle of birth and death.

## Commentary

A **Sadhu** is known as **Swakhyatadharma** who teaches the true Dharma, which is the right knowledge (Shruta-Samyakgyan) and right conduct (Charitra-Samyakachar), in a proper and well-understood manner. This epithet reveals the Sadhu's knowledge and Samadhi, because without specific knowledge, one cannot present Dharma beautifully.

**Vichkikitsa** is the wavering of the mind, mental doubts, or the disgust and condemnation of the learned. Overcoming this, one should believe that whatever the **Jineshwara Deva** has said is true, and with this faith, one should remain free from doubt in the mind. One should practice restraint, living only on what is available and necessary, whether it be food or other required materials.

Those who are born again and again are called **Praja**. Earth and other beings are included in Praja. One who considers them equal to their own soul is called a **Bhavasadhu**. It is said that just as I do not find suffering pleasant or good, in the same way, it is not pleasant for all beings. Knowing this, one who does not harm any beings, does not cause others to harm them, and treats them with equality, is called a **Shraman**. He experiences that just as I feel pain when someone is angry with me, scares me, or blames me, in the same way, other beings also feel pain. Understanding this, the Sadhu considers all Praja-beings as equal to himself.

The Sadhu should not become attached to the life of unrestrained indulgence in this world. He should not accumulate karma by desiring to live a long time with pleasure, or by developing such a determination or outcome in his mind. A **Sutapasvi**, a Sadhu with excellent austerity or one who is burning with intense austerity, should not accumulate wealth, grain, bipeds, quadrupeds, or other forms of wealth.

## Sri Samadhyayanam

The Sutrakar, acknowledging knowledge, vision, and Samadhi, says:

## Chhaya

"All senses are withdrawn from the Praja, the Muni should walk free from all bonds. See, even individual beings, afflicted by suffering, are tormented."

## Translation

The Muni should control all his senses in relation to the Praja - women. He should practice pure restraint, being free from all bonds, both external and internal. He should see that in this world, individual beings are afflicted by suffering and tormented.

## Commentary

"All those senses, including touch, etc., are withdrawn from them. The meaning is that he is **Samvritendriya** (with senses controlled) and **Jiteindriya** (with senses conquered). Why? Because in women, there are five types of objects, starting with sound. It is said:

"The beautiful words of the charming women, the pleasant ones, the ones that are seen, the beautiful pictures, the beautiful women, the taste, the smell, and the kisses."

Therefore, since there are five sense objects in women, one should be **Samvritendriya** (with senses controlled) in relation to them. This is what is shown by the word "**Charet**" - he should practice restraint. "**Muni**" - the Sadhu. "**Sarvata:**" - free from attachment, both external and internal, especially free from attachment. The Muni is **Nisanka** (without attachment) and **Nishkinchan** (without possessions). Being free from all bonds, he should "**Pashya**" - see, observe, in individual bodies, such as earth, etc.

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Sutra Kritanga Sutra
Observe the living beings (sattva) that are subtle, gross, complete, and incomplete, different in nature, who have come to oneness from the word 'api' (also) indicating the vegetable kingdom. What are they like? - They are afflicted by suffering, arising from the arising of unpleasant feelings, or they torment (duhkham) with the eight types of karma. They are being cooked (paripacyamanah) in the cauldron of the cycle of rebirth with the fuel of their own actions, or they are distressed (artaddhyanopagatan) by their wrongly directed senses, tormented by their mind, speech, and body.

In these (beings), the ignorant one (bala), while committing, revolves in the evil karmas. Committing evil deeds excessively, he also makes others commit evil deeds.

Explanation: The ignorant being, through acts of violence, oppression, and harassment towards the earth-bodied and other living beings, extensively commits evil deeds. And by instigating others, he also causes them to commit evil deeds. Thus, he experiences suffering both here and hereafter due to the ripening of those evil karmas.

Page #477:
---------------------------
The act of Samadhyayana, Jnanaavaran, etc. is performed, and by employing servants and others in acts of violence, etc., one commits sinful karma. By speaking falsely, etc., and causing others to do so, one accumulates sinful karma. ||5||

Commentary: The ignorant person who inflicts pain on any other person, indicated by the word 'cha', on each and every one of the two types of plant bodies, namely, the specific and the general, by breaking, cutting, burning, melting, dissolving, and by causing suffering in any other way, indicated by the word 'aādi', earns great sin. He is born again and again in these beings, such as earth, etc., to experience the fruits of his sin, and is tormented and suffers for an infinite period of time. Here, the reading 'evam tu bale' is also found. The word 'evam' used here is for indicating demonstration or example. Just as a thief or a man who goes to another's wife commits a corrupt act and suffers in this world in the form of having his hands and feet cut off, being bound, and being killed, in the same way, other men who commit sinful acts also suffer in this world and the next. This is proved by general observation and inference. In some places, the reading 'auttati' is found. Its meaning is that a wise man, seeing, hearing, or knowing the consequences of evil deeds, refrains from them.

What are the bases of sin? In which do beings engage? And from which do they refrain? In answer to this, it is said: By killing living beings, a man binds himself to the evil karma of Jnanaavaran, etc. And he who employs his servants and other men in acts of violence, engages in sinful conduct. The word 'tu' used here indicates that he speaks falsely, etc., and causes others to do so. By doing so, he accumulates sin.

"Even those who live by begging, etc., commit sin. The Tirthankaras have described the state of complete absorption in the mind. A man who is wise, stable in his mind, and devoted to meditation, remains free from violence." ||6||

Commentary: Another point: He who lives by begging, etc., out of compassion for the poor, is called a 'dīna-karuṇāspada'. Even such a person commits sinful karma. Another reading is 'ādinabhojyapi pāpam karoti'. It is said:

"Even a beggar who is wicked does not escape hell."

A beggar, even if he is wicked, does not escape hell. He may sometimes get a good meal, but due to his ignorance, he may become angry and fall into the seventh hell. For example, a beggar who lives by begging may be going out of the city of Rajagriha to attend a festival, and due to fate, he may fall from a mountain and be killed. Thus, even a beggar, like a 'piṇḍolaka', etc., commits sinful karma. Having understood this, the Tirthankaras have described the state of complete absorption in the mind, which is the highest state of meditation, etc.

Page #478:
---------------------------
The Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra, for the liberation from the cycle of birth and death, the Tirthankaras, Ganadharas, etc., are the embodiments of the Dravya Samadhis, which are producers of pleasure from touch, etc., are Anekantika and Anatyantika, and ultimately produce Samadhi. Thus it is said:
"Although the objects of the mind, which are to be avoided, are pleasing, they are like the Kimpaka fruit, which is pleasant at first, but later becomes very difficult to digest." ||1||
And so on. Thus, the 'Buddha', who has realized the truth, is devoted to the four types of knowledge, etc., and is established in 'Viveka', or is devoted to the Dravya Bhava, which is the abandonment of food, utensils, and passions. Such a person is free from the ten types of destruction of life, etc. Therefore, he is established in the right path, the soul of whom is established in the 'Thiyacci', or is endowed with a pure, stable, and radiant Leshya. ||6||
Commentary: One who engages in a livelihood that is compassionate and pitiful is called a beggar, etc., and he also commits sin. In some places, the reading 'Adin Bhoji' is found. Its meaning is that a man who earns his livelihood with great difficulty also commits sin. It is said that a man who wanders about for a piece of bread, who is wicked and immoral, does not escape hell. Such an ignorant creature, if he does not get a good, pleasant meal, may become distressed and angry, and may even be born in the seventh hell. For example, in the city of Rajagriha, a monk, not getting alms from the people who had come out for a festival, became angry with them and was about to climb Mount Vaibhar to throw stones at them. He started climbing, but by chance his foot slipped. He fell and died. Therefore, one who earns his livelihood with the sorrow of a beggar also commits sin. Knowing this, the Tirthankaras and Ganadharas, etc., have preached and expounded the knowledge, etc., in the form of Bhava Samadhi, which is liberating from the ocean of the world, which is Anekantika and Anatyantika, and which is conducive to the welfare of the soul. Dravya Samadhi produces physical pleasures from touch, etc., but it is not Anekantika or Anatyantika. The pleasures obtained from them are uncertain and short-lived, and ultimately they produce Asamadhi and suffering. It is said: Just as the Kimpaka fruit is very pleasing to eat, but later proves to be very painful. In the same way, worldly enjoyments also please the mind when they are enjoyed, but later become very painful. Therefore, a wise and knowledgeable man should remain devoted to the four types of knowledge, etc., Samadhi. Or he should abandon food, utensils, and passions, and engage in Dravya Bhava Samadhi. By doing so, he will be free from the ten types of destruction of life, etc., and will keep his soul firmly established in the right path, the path of right practice. Or, according to the reading 'Thiyacci', the saint should be endowed with a pure, stable, and radiant Leshya.
All the world should be seen with equanimity, one should not do anything that is pleasant or unpleasant to anyone. ||7||
Commentary: The saint should see the whole world with equanimity, he should not do anything that is pleasant or unpleasant to anyone. Or he should not consider anyone to be pleasant or unpleasant. There are many who, having risen up, having taken vows,

The Jain term "Samadhyayan" refers to the practice of deep meditation and contemplation. When faced with hardships and obstacles, some individuals become disheartened and weak, abandoning their virtuous life and falling into sin. Many become obsessed with receiving praise, respect, and recognition through verses and accolades.

**Commentary:**

The term "Jagat" refers to the entire universe, encompassing all living beings. A true Jain practitioner should view all beings with equanimity, without any attachment or aversion. They should not consider anyone as an object of love or hate. As the saying goes, "There is no one who is hateful or lovable among all living beings." Similarly, a Jain should not engage in actions that bring pleasure or displeasure to others. They should live a life free from attachments and desires.

However, some individuals, despite attaining a state of deep meditation, may become discouraged by hardships and obstacles. They may succumb to despair and seek solace in worldly pleasures. Others may become attached to material possessions and seek recognition through praise and respect. Some may even resort to begging for clothes and other necessities. Others may pursue knowledge in subjects like grammar, mathematics, astrology, and omens, seeking fame and recognition.

**Verse 8:**

The verse describes individuals who are driven by desires and attachments. It speaks of those who are obsessed with food and seek it out relentlessly, those who are attached to women and seek to acquire wealth and possessions to attract them, and those who are attached to children and seek to accumulate wealth for their sake. All these actions are considered to be sinful and lead to further suffering.

**Commentary:**

The term "Ahadakarma" refers to the practice of performing actions with the intention of receiving something in return. The verse criticizes those who are driven by desires and seek to acquire things for their own benefit. It also criticizes those who are attached to worldly pleasures and seek to accumulate wealth and possessions. These actions are considered to be harmful and lead to suffering.

Page #480:
---------------------------
English translation preserving Jain terms:

The person who is attached to the Asakta (sensual pleasures) of women, who is immersed in their speech, laughter, and bodily limbs like a child devoid of discrimination between right and wrong, and who, due to this attachment, cannot obtain them without wealth, accumulates sin by any means to acquire that wealth-property which is the means (for obtaining them). 

Such a person, being afflicted with sorrow in the endeavor of self-restraint (Samyama-udyoga) of the Parshvasthavasanna-kushila (those who have fallen from the path while living near the ascetic), indulges in the unrighteous conduct, becomes lax in righteous conduct, and thus sinks in the mire of the worldly existence.

The one who is driven by hatred (Vairanugiddha) accumulates karmic matter, and upon death, he attains the difficult-to-cross (Durgam) state of suffering (in hell, etc.). Therefore, the wise (Medhavi) person, after carefully examining the Dharma, should practice (Chare) as a Muni (ascetic), completely freed (Vippamukte) from all attachments.

Page #481:
---------------------------
The one who is engaged in the act of acquiring wealth, who is devoid of compassion and mercy, who accumulates wealth through such actions or accumulates karma for the purpose of accumulating wealth, binds karma. Due to enmity with beings and due to the accumulation of sin, he is expelled from this existence, dies, and is reborn in the next life, being born in hell, etc., and suffers terrible torment. Therefore, the wise, the discerning, the disciplined, the virtuous, the knower of all the qualities of samadhi, should review, criticize, contemplate, and discuss the scriptures and the dharma based on conduct, and accept it. He should renounce external and internal attachments and practice restraint, the only means to attain liberation. He should be completely free from women and the beginning of violence, etc., and wander without attachment, with an uncertain mind.

"He should not do this for the sake of life, nor should he wander about attached. He should not speak in a way that is not conducive to harmony, nor should he speak of greed, nor should he speak of violence." (10)

Commentary: "He should not do this for the sake of life" - the word "this" refers to the acquisition of wealth, or the acquisition of the eight types of karma that are acquired as a result of the acquisition of wealth. "In this world" - meaning in this world. "A non-restrained person who lives for the sake of enjoyment" - meaning a person who lives for the sake of enjoyment. Alternatively, he should not accumulate wealth out of fear of livelihood. Another reading is "He should not desire" - meaning he should not desire the objects of the senses. "He should not be attached" - meaning he should not be attached to his home, children, wife, etc. "He should wander" - meaning he should be a wandering ascetic. "He should not speak in a way that is not conducive to harmony" - meaning he should speak after listening and considering. "He should not speak of greed" - meaning he should not be greedy for words, etc. "He should not speak of violence" - meaning he should not speak of violence, which is the oppression of beings. He should not speak of anything that is harmful to himself or others. For example, he should not speak of things like "drink, eat, enjoy, kill, cut, strike, cook," which are the causes of sin. (10)

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra states: "One should not desire the Aahaarakanda (food prepared for the ascetic), nor should one praise those who desire it. One should perform austerities, emaciate the body, and abandon grief without being attached to it."

Explanation:
- The ascetic should not desire the Aahaarakanda, i.e., the food prepared for him. 
- One who desires such food should not be praised or associated with.
- The ascetic should perform Dhuni (austerities) to emaciate the body for the purpose of Nirjara (shedding of karmic matter).
- He should abandon grief without being attached to it, i.e., remain equanimous.

The text further states: "One should aspire for Ekatva (singleness, oneness), for that is the true Pramoksha (liberation). This Pramoksha is indeed the best, for one who is free from anger, steadfast in truth, and engaged in austerities."

Explanation:
- The ascetic should aspire for the state of Ekatva, i.e., oneness, non-attachment.
- This state of Ekatva is the true Pramoksha, the highest liberation.
- One who is free from anger (Akrodhana), steadfast in truth (Satyarata), and engaged in austerities (Tapasvi) is the best.

**Shri Samadhyayanam**

"Ego me sasao appa, naanadansanasanjuo. Sesha me bahira bhava, savve sangyogalakkhana." ||1||

**Shadow:** One is my eternal soul, united with knowledge and vision. The rest are external things, all marked by association. ||1||

**Commentary:** One should cultivate the feeling of oneness. By being imbued with the feeling of oneness, one should not desire the help of others. Because in this world, which is afflicted by birth, old age, death, sickness, and sorrow, no one is capable of saving or protecting a being who is suffering from the fruits of his own actions. Therefore, it is said: "My own soul, united with knowledge and vision, is eternal. All remaining things are external, they are marked by association, obtained through association." Thus, the virtuous should always cultivate the feeling of oneness. By cultivating this feeling of oneness, one attains liberation - freedom from all attachments. There is not even a little bit of falsehood in this. See this. Consider. The aim of the feeling of oneness is liberation, which is true. This is the best - the main or the supreme. This is the state of meditative absorption, or whoever is an ascetic, whose body is purified by austerity, who is free from anger, who is free from pride, delusion, and greed, who is devoted to truth, that man is liberated. Truly, he is the best or the supreme.

**Verse 13:**

"Itthi ya araya mehunao, pariggaham cheva akuvva mane. Ucchavasu visasu tai, nissansayam bhikku samahipatte." ||13||

**Shadow:** He who does not engage in sexual misconduct with women, nor accumulates possessions, and remains unattached to pleasures of all kinds, high and low, is a monk who has attained meditative absorption, without a doubt.

**Commentary:** He who does not engage in sexual misconduct with divine women, human women, and animal women - in these three types of women, who are objects of desire - "sexual misconduct" means he is not attached to them. The word "tu" indicates that he is also free from killing, etc. And he who does not accumulate possessions - that which is acquired from all sides - wealth, grain, bipeds, and quadrupeds, and does not establish his ego in them, and who remains unattached to pleasures of all kinds, high and low - he is a protector of others, a giver of special teachings, and he has attained meditative absorption, without a doubt. He is a virtuous man, endowed with the qualities of the root and the branches. No one else is like him. He who has attained meditative absorption in pleasures of all kinds, does not become attached to them. He does not become attached to pleasures of all kinds.

The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states that a **Sadhu** who is not attached to worldly pleasures, who is not swayed by the allure of material possessions, and who is compassionate towards all living beings, is endowed with the **Mula Guna** and **Uttara Guna**. Such a **Sadhu** attains **Bhaava Samadhi**. One who does not possess these qualities cannot attain **Bhaava Samadhi**. A **Sadhu** who has attained **Bhaava Samadhi** does not indulge in worldly pleasures.

**Verse 14:**

**Text:** "A **Bhikshu** who has overcome attachment and aversion, endures the touch of grass, cold, heat, bites, and mosquitoes, as well as pleasant and unpleasant smells."

**Translation:** A **Sadhu** should overcome attachment to worldly pleasures and aversion to hardships. They should endure the touch of grass, cold, heat, bites, and mosquitoes, as well as pleasant and unpleasant smells.

**Commentary:** The **Sutrakar** explains how a **Sadhu** attains **Bhaava Samadhi** without indulging in worldly pleasures. A **Bhaava Bhikshu**, who is a seeker of truth, is detached from the body and desires only liberation. They overcome attachment to worldly pleasures and aversion to hardships. For example, they endure the touch of grass, cold, heat, bites, and mosquitoes, as well as pleasant and unpleasant smells. They do this with equanimity and without any desire for personal gain.

**Verse 15:**

**Text:** "A **Sadhu** who is silent and has attained **Samadhi** should wander with a pure heart. They should not build a house or allow others to build one for them. They should renounce all attachments to women."

**Translation:** A **Sadhu** who is silent and has attained **Samadhi** should wander with a pure heart. They should not build a house or allow others to build one for them. They should renounce all attachments to women.

**Commentary:** The **Sutrakar** explains that a **Sadhu** who has attained **Samadhi** should be silent and have a pure heart. They should not build a house or allow others to build one for them. They should renounce all attachments to women. This is because these things are distractions from the path of liberation.

##  Sri Samadhyayanam Teeka -  

**A person who remains silent, or speaks only after careful consideration of the subject matter, attains a state of Samadhi. He should then absorb the pure Leshyas like Tejas, etc., and discard the impure ones like Krishna, etc. He should then practice restraint in all directions.  **

**Furthermore, he should not build a house or have one built for him, as this would imply attachment.  Just as a snake does not build its own burrow but lives in one built by another, so too should a sage not build a house or decorate it.  **

**The scripture further states that one who desires to renounce worldly duties should avoid actions that lead to mingling with those who are born again and again.  This means that even a renunciate who cooks or causes others to cook, engages in mingling with householders.  Similarly, a renunciate should avoid mingling with women, as this would hinder his unwavering restraint. **

Similarly, a renunciate should avoid mingling with women, as this would hinder his unwavering restraint. 

**Chhaya:**  Some people in this world, when asked about the nature of the soul, declare it to be inactive. 

**Anuvaad:**  Those in this world who believe that the soul is inactive and who, when asked, prescribe liberation, are attached to existence. They are greedy and attached to the beginning of actions like violence, etc. They do not know the Dharma which is the cause of liberation. 

**Teeka:**  Furthermore, those in this world who accept the Sankhya philosophy, which holds that the soul is inactive, believe that the soul is inactive because it is all-pervading.  As it is said, "The soul is inactive, without qualities, and the enjoyer, as per the Kapila Darshan."  This statement clarifies that the soul is understood to be inactive due to its formlessness and pervasiveness.  These proponents of the inactive soul, believing that bondage and liberation do not occur when the soul is inactive, when asked about the existence of liberation, even while presenting the inactive soul philosophy, prescribe liberation and its absence.  They are attached to the beginning of actions like cooking, bathing, etc., and are greedy for worldly pleasures.  They do not know the Dharma, which is the cause of liberation, and are therefore misguided.

Page #486:
---------------------------
According to the principles of Sankhya, as propounded in the Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra, the soul is not the doer. It is devoid of qualities (nirguna) and experiences the fruits of actions (karma). Here, the word "tu" is used in the sense of a qualifier, indicating a characteristic of the soul. Sankhya philosophers argue that due to its abstract nature and pervasiveness, the soul is inactive. This is proven. According to the theory of inaction (akriyatmavada) in Sankhya, bondage and liberation are not possible in an inactive soul. However, when questioned, they argue that bondage and liberation do occur even within their theory of inaction. Sankhya followers engage in activities like digestion, cooking food, getting food cooked by others, and immersing themselves in water for bathing. Thus, they remain involved in actions that are both initiated and accompanied by faults. They do not understand the true nature of Dharma, which is the sole means of liberation, based on past scriptures and conduct. They follow the wrong path and lack true knowledge of Dharma.

Further, these humans are divided in their views, some believing in action and some in inaction. Just as a newborn child's body is cut up for pleasure, so too does the unrestrained man increase enmity through his actions.

Commentary: There are diverse opinions in this human world. The word "tu" here signifies a specific point. The author, while presenting these diverse opinions, states that action and inaction are distinct. Therefore, some believe in action and some in inaction. The proponents of action believe that action is the only means to achieve results, for how can a man experience pleasure simply by knowing about women and food? Thus, they believe that action is the only way to achieve results and adhere to the theory of action. Conversely, those who believe in inaction adhere to the theory of inaction. The nature of both these theories will be discussed in detail later. These humans with diverse opinions, who believe in action and inaction, and who do not understand Dharma as the means to liberation, remain attached to the beginning of actions, are controlled by their senses, and desire pleasure and wealth. They do this by cutting up the body of a newborn child, who is ignorant and unable to distinguish between right and wrong, for their own pleasure. Thus, the unrestrained man, who engages in such harmful actions and is not restrained in any way, increases enmity towards others, which is rooted in past lives and intensifies through mutual oppression. Alternatively, the boldness of a child who is ignorant and engages in harmful actions like violence, and who is devoid of compassion, increases enmity.

Page #487:
---------------------------
Sri Samadhyayana is considered meaningless. Further, a detailed analysis of its nature will be done. The point is that people with different opinions, according to their liking, are resorting to and relying on action and inaction. They do not know the Dharma which is the cause of liberation. They are engrossed in violence and other beginnings, and being under the control of the senses, they desire delicious food, comfort, etc. They even go so far as to consider the body of a newly born child, devoid of knowledge or naive and devoid of the discrimination of good and bad, as a source of pleasure for themselves. Thus, one who engages in actions that are harmful to others, causing pain, is unrestrained, not free from sin, and cultivates a feeling of enmity towards beings, which is a factor of mutual oppression and destruction that lasts for hundreds of births. Here, the reading "Jayae Balass Pagabbhanae" is obtained. Its meaning is that the boldness of the ignorant being who is engaged in violent deeds, devoid of compassion and mercy, is ruthless. This increases his enmity towards beings.

---------------------------
The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra says: A being who is attached to the idea of "mine" thinks, "This object is mine, I am its owner."  Becoming attached in this way, he acts with audacity, with inappropriate and bold behavior. There is an illustration of this: A merchant, after enduring great hardship, acquired a very valuable gem and stayed outside the city of Ujjain. He spent the whole night worrying that the king, thieves, or even his own family might take his gems. He thought, "How can I keep these gems safe?"  The entire night passed in this way. He did not realize that the night was passing. Later, when the day dawned, he began to hide his gems in a secret place. The king's men saw him and took the gems from him. In the same way, a person, bewildered by indecision, thinks, "What should I do?"  He does not realize that his life is passing away. He becomes attached to possessions and, driven by his initial impulses, commits sinful acts of audacity. He remains thirsty and greedy for sensual pleasures, and like the tormented merchant who is attached to his possessions, he spends his days and nights consumed by the desire for wealth. He torments his body. It is said: An ignorant being, believing himself to be immortal, thinks, "I will never grow old, nor will I ever die."  Driven by his desire for wealth, he suffers. He thinks, "My life and my wealth will last forever."  Thus, tormented by anxious thoughts, he wonders, "When will the caravan of merchants leave? When will they depart from here? What goods are they carrying? How far will they go?"  To protect his wealth, he sometimes digs into mountains or other high places, sometimes digs into the earth, and sometimes looks for other places. He cannot sleep at night and is constantly suspicious during the day. In this way, he becomes confused by the pain of the four mental afflictions and, like the merchant who believes himself to be immortal, he is devoid of good intentions and pure outcomes. He engages in violence and other harmful actions day and night.

**Verse 19:**

"Abandon wealth, livestock, and all possessions. Relatives, loved ones, and friends are of no real help. Even though a person laments and mourns for them, and is attached to them, others will take his wealth when he dies."

**Commentary:**

"Wealth" refers to all kinds of material possessions, and "livestock" refers to cows, buffaloes, and all other animals. Do not become attached to them. "Relatives" include parents, in-laws, and all those who are related by blood or marriage. "Loved ones and friends" include those who play together and share common interests. These parents, in-laws, and friends do not truly help a person. Yet, he laments and mourns for them, and becomes attached to his wealth, livestock, relatives, and friends. For example, he cries out, "Oh, Mother! Oh, Father!" and becomes consumed by grief and sorrow. He becomes attached to his possessions and falls into delusion. Even though he is handsome, he is like a skeleton; even though he is wealthy, he is like a merchant attached to his possessions; even though he has grain, he is like a wealthy merchant who hoards his wealth. He loses his composure and becomes confused. The wealth that he has acquired through great hardship and by oppressing others will be taken away by others, either while he is alive or after he dies. He will only experience suffering and the bondage of karma. Knowing this, one should abandon sinful actions and practice austerities.

Page #489:
---------------------------
**Sri Samadhyayanam Teekaarth** - Abandon all kinds of wealth and riches, as well as cattle like cows and buffaloes. Do not have the feeling of "mine" - that they belong to you.  Parents and other relatives known from before, and in-laws and others known later, are family members. And those childhood friends who played in the mud together in their youth, cannot do anything for you. But the reality is that humans cry again and again for wealth, animals, family members, and friends. They lament, "Alas, mother! Alas, father!" and become grief-stricken for them. They become infatuated, accumulating wealth for them. Even a man with a handsome physique like a Kandarik, wealthy like a Mamman Vanik, and prosperous with grains like a Tilaka Shreshthi, remains infatuated without Samadhi. He earns wealth through the oppression and violence of other beings, which is extremely painful.  This wealth is taken away by others either during his lifetime or after his death. He only experiences suffering and accumulates karmic bonds. Knowing this, a human should abandon sinful actions and practice austerities.

**Siham Jaha Khudumiga Charanta, Dure Charanti Parisankamana. Evam Tu Mehavi Samikkha Dhamma, Duren Pavam Parivajejja ||20||**

**Chhaya** - Just as deer and other small animals, fearing the lion, roam far away, similarly, a wise person, after examining Dharma, should avoid evil from afar.

**Anuvaad** - Just as deer and other small animals, fearing the lion, roam far away, similarly, a wise person, after examining Dharma, should avoid evil from afar.

**Teeka** - The author speaks about the means of austerity - Just as small animals, like deer, roam in the forest, fearing the lion or tiger, which can harm them, and avoid those places where they might be, similarly, a wise person, who is disciplined, after examining Dharma, should avoid evil from afar, through mind, speech, and body, and engage in restraint and austerity. Or, just as a deer, seeking its own good, avoids the lion, similarly, a person seeking self-welfare should avoid sinful actions, which are the cause of evil, from afar.

The wise man, knowing the truth, should turn away from sin. Violence gives rise to suffering, and it is the cause of enmity, which is a great fear. 

**Commentary:** 
The wise man is one whose intellect is beautiful and praiseworthy. The wise man, desiring liberation, should engage in the practices prescribed by the scriptures and abandon those that are forbidden. The wise man should turn away from sin, such as violence, falsehood, etc., because the destruction of the cause leads to the destruction of the effect. Therefore, the wise man who desires the destruction of all karma should first block the doors of the inflow. 

Violence, which is the taking of life, gives rise to evil karma, which leads to suffering in hell and other places of torment. It also creates enmity, which binds one for hundreds of thousands of years. Therefore, it is a great fear. Knowing this, the wise man should turn away from sin. 

There is also a variant reading: "He should turn away from the world of liberation." This means that just as a warrior who has returned from battle is no longer engaged in war and does not harm anyone, so too should a virtuous person, free from sinful actions, remain on the path of restraint.

Page #491:
---------------------------
## Shri Samadhyayanam

**Translation:**

The **Āpta-gāmi** - the virtuous one who is progressing on the path laid out by the omniscient - does not speak falsely. The complete abandonment of falsehood is called **samādhi** or liberation. Similarly, he does not consume falsehood himself, nor does he cause others to do so, nor does he approve of those who do so.

**Commentary and Āpta:**

The path to liberation is called **Āpta**. One who walks on this path is called **Āpta-gāmi** or **Ātma-hita-gāmi**. Alternatively, one whose passions, hatred, anger, pride, etc. are destroyed is called **Āpta**. He is omniscient. The person who walks on the path laid out by him is called **Āpta-gāmi**. Such an **Āpta-gāmi** virtuous person does not speak **mṛṣā-vāda** - falsehood or untruth. Even if it is true, he does not speak a word that harms living beings - killing, pain, etc. The abandonment of falsehood is the complete **samādhi** and liberation - so say the wise. The worldly **samādhi** arising from bathing, eating, etc. and the enjoyment of words and other objects are **anekāntīka** - uncertain and **anātyantīka** - not ultimate - not complete. It is only a means of counteracting suffering. Therefore, it is incomplete. Therefore, the virtuous person does not consume falsehood himself, nor does he cause others to do so, nor does he approve of those who do so with his mind, speech, and body.

**❀❀**

**Translation:**

The pure one should not be contaminated by others, nor should he be deluded by the allure of the world. The steadfast and liberated one does not seek praise, nor does he wander in the path of worldly desires.

**Commentary:**

**Chāyā:**

The virtuous one should not contaminate his character with passion and hatred when he receives pure food, free from the defects of origin and production. It is said: "O living being, do not be deceitful in the midst of the dense forest of forty-two kinds of defects! If you are not deceitful while eating, then it is useless."

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

There, to explain the predominance of attachment, it is said: "Not fainting, not fainting" - even if one obtains a beautiful meal, one should eat without greed, and even if one is not eligible, one should not desire that same food again and again, but should eat only for the sake of maintaining the path of restraint.  Generally, even for a wise person, excessive desire arises in the presence of special food. Therefore, the two prohibitions, "not fainting" and "not eligible," are stated. It is said:

> "The one who has enjoyed pleasures in the past, who is a scholar of the scriptures, and who is always mindful of the Self, even he becomes quickly desirous of good food." (1)

**Commentary:** The Sutrakar now points out the opposite qualities, saying: If a virtuous person obtains food free from the faults of origin, production, and desire, then he will not defile his character through attachment and aversion. It is said: "O being! You have not been deceived by the forty-one faults, the deep troubles, the darkness. But now, if you are not deceived while eating, you will be successful." There too, attachment is the main thing among attachment and aversion. To explain this, the Sutrakar says: A virtuous person, even when obtaining beautiful, excellent, delicious food, should eat without being even slightly attached to it. He should not desire that same food again and again, but should eat only for the sake of maintaining the path of restraint. Generally, even in the mind of a wise person, intense desire arises when special, excellent food is available. Therefore, it is prohibited twice. It is said: "The one who has enjoyed pleasures in the past, who is a scholar of the scriptures, and who is always mindful of the Self, even he becomes quickly desirous of good food."

The virtuous person should be steadfast in restraint, patient, and stable. He should be free from external and internal attachments. He should not desire to be honored or respected through clothes, vessels, etc. He should not desire praise or fame. He should not perform any action for the sake of fame.

> "Having left the household, he should be desireless, he should abandon his body, having cut off the root cause. He should not desire life, nor should he desire death. The monk should walk free from the cycle of existence." (24)

**Commentary:** Having left the household, the initiated virtuous person should be desireless, free from attachment, and should abandon his body, having cut off the root cause. He should not be attached to his body. He should not desire the fruits of his austerities. In this way, he should be free from the desire for life and death, and should remain separate from the worldly cycle, engaged in the practice of restraint.

**Translation:** Having left the household, the initiated virtuous person should be desireless, free from attachment, and should abandon his body, having cut off the root cause. He should not be attached to his body. He should not desire the fruits of his austerities. In this way, he should be free from the desire for life and death, and should remain separate from the worldly cycle, engaged in the practice of restraint.

**Commentary:** The one who desires to study asks: "Having left the household, even after becoming an initiate, he should be desireless in life, he should abandon his body, he should not perform any action, such as treatment, etc., with a sense of attachment, he should be free from the root cause, and he should not desire life, nor should he desire death."

## The Sutra of the Sutra-Creator

**Eleventh**

**In what way, O Mahaan, is the path of liberation explained by the wise?**

**The path that is straight and pure, by which one crosses the insurmountable ocean.** (1)

**Commentary:**

What path is declared by the wise Mahaan, the one who knows all? The path that is straight, by which one crosses the insurmountable ocean.

**Translation:**

The wise and omniscient Mahaan, the teacher of non-violence, the Lord Mahavira, has revealed what is the simple path to liberation. By attaining this path, a being can cross the ocean of the world, which is difficult to cross.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra is initiated by a questioner from the future, due to the unique and timeless nature of the Sutra. Therefore, Jambuswami asks Sudharmaswami, "What kind of path is this, which is capable of attaining liberation in this three-world realm? What path is declared by the Lord, who is capable of liberating the three worlds, who is the ultimate well-wisher, who teaches non-violence?" He is the Mahaan, the Tirthankara. The one who knows all, the one who has the knowledge of the subtle, the obstructed, the distant, the past, the present, and the future, the one who illuminates all things in the world and beyond, is the wise one. The path that is declared by him is the path of liberation, which is straight and pure, because it reveals the true nature of things. It is straight because it relies on the twelve principles of Syadvada, which explain the general, the particular, the eternal, and the non-eternal. By attaining this path, which is composed of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, a being who is trapped in the belly of the world, who is equipped with all the necessary resources, crosses the ocean of existence, which is extremely difficult to cross, because it is difficult to obtain the resources necessary to cross it.

**As it is said:**

**"Human birth, family, lineage, beauty, health, lifespan, intellect, hearing, understanding, faith, and restraint are all rare in the world."** (1)

**Commentary:**

The Sutra is unique and special in its composition. It takes into account the present, the past, and the future. Therefore, this Sutra is initiated by a questioner from the future. Jambuswami asks Sudharmaswami, "O Lord! The Tirthankara Mahavira, who is capable of liberating the three worlds, who is the ultimate well-wisher, who teaches non-violence, what path has he revealed that is capable of attaining liberation in the three worlds?" He describes the qualities of the Lord, saying, "He is wise and great, full of knowledge." Wisdom is that which illuminates all things in the world and beyond, including the subtle, the obstructed, the distant, the past, the present, and the future. It is the form of omniscience or perfect knowledge. It is present in the Lord, therefore, the Lord is wise. The path of liberation that he has revealed is the path of auspiciousness. It reveals the true nature of things. Therefore, it is a straight path to liberation, without any twists or turns. It is straight because it relies on the twelve principles of Syadvada, which explain the general, the particular, the eternal, and the non-eternal. It is composed of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct. By attaining this path, a being who is trapped in the belly of the world, who is in the cave of the world, who is within the world, who is equipped with all the necessary resources, crosses the ocean of existence, which is extremely difficult to cross, because it is difficult to obtain the resources necessary to cross it.

Page #495:
---------------------------
The material related to the liberation of beings, which is the subject of the path of knowledge, makes one cross this extremely difficult ocean of the world. In fact, the material that makes one cross the ocean of the world is very difficult to obtain - it is obtained with great difficulty. It is said that human birth, the Aryan field, the best caste, the best family, the best form, a healthy body, longevity and intelligence, the opportunity to hear the Dharma, faith in the Dharma and restraint - pure character, obtaining these is very rare.
"That path is the best, pure, liberating from all suffering. Do you know, O monks! Tell us, O great sage." ||2||
Commentary - The same questioner asks again - the path that is beneficial to all beings, which was taught by the omniscient, is free from all deceit and crookedness, that path is the best - the main one, hence it is the best, it is pure - free from defects, because it is free from the defects of contradiction and harm, and because it is free from the teaching of sinful conduct. Thus, it liberates from all - all the sufferings that have been accumulated over many births, because they are the cause of suffering - karma. O monks! O great sage! Just as you know, "na" in the sentence structure, so tell us that path, which was taught by the omniscient. ||2||
_Meaning of the Commentary - The one who asked before, asks again - the path that the omniscient Lord Mahavira taught for the benefit of all beings, is complete - perfect, free from any deficiency, definitely free from crookedness. There is no path better than that path, hence it is the best - free from defects. It does not speak contradictory things. It does not teach sinful actions. It liberates from the karmas that are the cause of suffering, which are accumulated over many births. O monks! O great sage! Tell us that best - supreme, pure and destroyer of all suffering path, just as you know.
If anyone asks us, gods or humans. Which path should we tell them? Tell us. ||3||
Commentary - If anyone asks us, gods or humans. Which path should we tell them? Tell us. ||3||
Translation - Jambuswami said to Sudharmaswami, if any god or human asks us, which path of liberation should we tell them, you tell us.

**Sri Sutra Kritanga Sutra Tika**

- Although our conduct is based on your belief due to our perception of your extraordinary qualities, how should we explain the path to others? With this intention, he says: When someone, some beings, who are troubled by the cycle of birth and death, ask us about the right path, who are they? - The gods of the four categories and humans, and since the question is likely to come from them, we should take them as the basis. When they ask, which path should I explain? You know this, so tell me. ||3||

**Tikaarth**

- Although we accept your belief due to your extraordinary qualities, how should we explain it to others? With this intention, Jambu Swami says: Lord! If some beings, who are troubled by the cycle of birth and death, ask us about the right path, which path should we tell them? Regarding those who ask, he says, who are they? While answering the question, he says: The gods of the four categories and humans, and since the question is likely to come from them, we should take them as the basis. You know this, so tell me.

- If someone asks, gods or humans,
You should tell them, listen to my essence of the path. ||4||

**Chhaya**

- If someone asks you, gods or humans,
You should tell them, listen to my essence of the path. ||4||

**Anuvaad**

- Sri Sudharma Swami says to Jambu Swami: If any god or human asks about liberation, you should tell them what I am saying, listen to it.

**Tika**

- Thus, when asked, Sudharma Swami says: If someone, some gods or humans, who are lost in the cycle of birth and death, ask about the right path, you should tell them the path that is described as the protection of the six categories of beings, the essence of the path, which you will explain to others, listen to me. Another reading is: "You should tell them this path, listen to me." This is the meaning. ||4||

Again, praising the path, Sudharma Swami says:

**The Path of Guidance**

**Verse:**

The path, as revealed by the great Lord Mahavira, I will explain in detail. Listen! Just as merchants and traders cross the ocean, so too have many beings crossed the ocean of existence by taking refuge in this path.

**Commentary:**

As I explain this path in detail, listen carefully. The path is attained through gradual practice, as follows:

* **First, the arising of the twelve karmas.**
* **Then, the destruction or pacification of the twelve karmas through yoga.**
* **This leads to the attainment of good conduct.**

And so on, until the four supreme limbs are attained.

What is this path? It is described as "great and terrible" because it is difficult to understand, just as a battlefield is difficult to enter for a coward. This path was revealed by Mahavira, the great Lord Vardhamana. I will explain it to you. This indicates that I am not speaking from my own intellect or imagination.

By embracing this pure path, many great beings have crossed the ocean of existence. Here is an analogy:

Merchants and traders who engage in buying and selling are called "vyavaharis." They travel to different cities seeking profit, and they cross even the most difficult oceans in their ships. Similarly, those who seek true and lasting happiness, who are free from attachment and obstacles, cross the ocean of existence through the path of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, guided by the Jinas.

**Verse:**

Some have crossed, others will cross, and I will explain this path to you. Listen to me, beings!

Page #498:
---------------------------
**The Sutra Kritanga Sutra**

**Translation:**

Sri Sudharma Swami says to his followers: "Many men have crossed the ocean of the world by embracing this path. They do so in the present and will continue to do so in the future. I have heard this path from Lord Mahavira, and I will tell it to you. Listen carefully."

**Commentary:**

The author of the sutra explains the characteristics of the path: "This path has been followed by great men. They have walked on it, and it is certainly conducive to liberation. By relying on it, countless beings from the beginning of time have been freed from the defilement of karma and crossed the ocean of the world. Even in the present time, there are countless beings who are equipped with all the necessary means for liberation and are crossing the ocean of the world. The existence of Siddhas in Mahavideha and other realms is eternal, and their state of liberation is always present. Therefore, it is not contradictory to speak of liberation in the present time. In the infinite future, countless beings will follow this path and cross the ocean of the world. Thus, this path is the means of liberation from the ocean of the world in all three times. It is the only path to liberation, the path of noble conduct. It was taught by the Tirthankaras, who have attained divine knowledge, omniscience. I have heard this path well and understood it. You are eager to listen, and knowing this, I will explain it. Sri Sudharma Swami, relying on Jambuswami, says this to all beings. Therefore, to make this clear, the author of the sutra says: "Beings, listen attentively to this path of conduct that I am speaking. This discourse is intended to generate the utmost respect for the ultimate truth."

**Verse 7:**

**Translation:**

"The earth itself is a living being. There are many other living beings that dwell on the earth. Water and fire are living beings, and there are separate living beings of the air, those with air bodies. Stalks, trees, and seeds are also living beings."

**Commentary:**

"Because the path of conduct is based on refraining from harming living beings, and because this requires knowledge of living beings, the author says: "The earth itself is a living being, and those who dwell on the earth are also living beings, earth-beings. Because they have individual bodies, they are to be understood as 'separate beings.' Water is also a living being, and so are those with fire bodies. And there are other air-beings. Thus, there are separate beings who dwell on the four great elements."

Page #499:
---------------------------
The essence of the path of liberation for a being is to understand that all beings are dependent on earth, water, fire, and air. Each being has a distinct body, but plants are considered to have a common body, and therefore, their individual bodies are not distinct. This is why the term "beings" is used in this verse. The subtle body of a plant is of the form of a "nigoda," while the "badara" plant is both common and uncommon. To explain the different types of uncommon bodies, the verse mentions examples like grass, darbha, virana, trees like mango and ashoka, and seeds like rice and wheat. All these are considered to be beings with plant bodies. This understanding refutes the views of Buddhists and others. The fact that these beings, including earth, water, fire, and air, are indeed living beings is explained in detail in the first chapter of the Acharanga Sutra, titled "Shastraparijna." Therefore, it is not elaborated upon here.

Page #500:
---------------------------
The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra states that there are four types of Kshetra-bheda (divisions of the universe).  Following this, the Tirthankaras and Ganadharas have explained the six Jivanikaayas (categories of living beings) as consisting of fourteen types of Bhuta-graamas (groups of elements).  In short, this is the extent of the Jivanikaaya, the living beings.  There is no other category of living beings besides these, including the Andaja (egg-born), Udbhijj (plant-born), and Samsvedaja (sweat-born). ||8||

Having thus explained the six Jivanikaayas, the Sutra-kar (author of the Sutra) now explains what should be done in relation to them:

_Commentary:_ The Sutra-kar now speaks of the sixth Jivanikaaya, the category of living beings, in order to explain the six types of beings.  Earth, water, fire, air, and plants are all one-sensed beings.  They are of four types: subtle, coarse, sufficient, and insufficient.  Those who are frightened or appear to be frightened are called "Trasa" (fearful).  These are two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed beings.  They include worms, insects, ants, bees, and humans.  Each of these two-sensed, three-sensed, and four-sensed beings are of six types, based on the distinction of sufficient and insufficient.  The five-sensed beings are of four types: Samanask (conscious), Asamnjni (unconscious), sufficient, and insufficient.  The Tirthankaras and Ganadharas have explained the six Jivanikaayas as consisting of fourteen types.  In short, this is the extent of the Jivanikaaya, the living beings, with all these distinctions.  The Andaja, Udbhijj, Samsvedaja, etc., are all included within these.  Therefore, there is no other category of living beings besides these.

Thus, having shown the six Jivanikaayas, the Sutra-kar explains what should be done in relation to them:

"All beings are endowed with life, and they are all subject to suffering.  Therefore, one should not harm any of them." ||9||

_Commentary:_ The wise person, with all the arguments and reasoning, should recognize the existence of all beings, knowing that they are all subject to suffering.  They do not desire suffering; they do not want it.  Therefore, one should not harm any of them, or any one of them.

_Commentary:_ All the arguments that are in accordance with the truth, such as the arguments for the existence of living beings in the categories of earth, water, fire, air, and plants, are valid.  These arguments are based on the principle of non-contradiction, and they are supported by the fact that the existence of these beings is not contradicted by any other evidence.  The wise person, with all these arguments, should recognize the existence of all beings in the categories of earth, water, fire, air, and plants, and should know that they are all subject to suffering.  They do not desire suffering; they do not want it.  Therefore, one should not harm any of them, or any one of them.

The arguments for the existence of living beings in the categories of earth, water, fire, air, and plants are as follows:

* Earth:  The existence of living beings in the category of earth is supported by the fact that earth is composed of the same elements as the bodies of living beings, such as coral, salt, and precious stones.  This is similar to the fact that the body of a living being is composed of the same elements as the food that it eats.
* Water:  The existence of living beings in the category of water is supported by the fact that water is conscious and can be affected by external stimuli, such as digging in the ground.  This is similar to the fact that a frog can be affected by external stimuli.
* Fire:  The existence of living beings in the category of fire is supported by the fact that fire can grow and increase in size when it is fed with fuel.  This is similar to the fact that a child can grow and increase in size when it is fed with food.
* Air:  The existence of living beings in the category of air is supported by the fact that air can be moved and directed by external forces, such as wind.  This is similar to the fact that a cow can be moved and directed by external forces.
* Plants:  The existence of living beings in the category of plants is supported by the fact that plants are born, grow old, die, and suffer from diseases.  This is similar to the fact that a woman is born, grows old, dies, and suffers from diseases.  The fact that plants can be wounded, can be nourished by food, can be milked, can be touched, can contract, can grow, can sleep, can wake up, can be approached, and can be affected by external stimuli, all point to the fact that plants are conscious.

The existence of living beings in the categories of two-sensed, three-sensed, and four-sensed beings is clear from the fact that these beings are capable of experiencing pain.  Their pain is caused by external stimuli, and it is natural and spontaneous.  This pain can be caused by the actions of the mind, speech, and body, and it can be prevented by avoiding actions that cause pain.  Therefore, one should avoid actions that cause pain to these beings. ||9||

**The essence of knowledge for a wise person is that they do not harm any living being. The principle of non-violence is connected to this very idea, one should know this.**

**Commentary:**

**This very thing is being affirmed here - the word "khu" is used for emphasis or as a figure of speech. This very thing, the cessation of the killing of living beings, is the "essence" of a wise person, one who knows the true nature of life and the bondage of actions that lead to death. This is being said again for emphasis and to show respect - that which does not harm any living being, which does not inflict unwanted pain and desires happiness, this is the most essential knowledge for even the most knowledgeable wise person. This is because the cessation of harming others is the most essential knowledge. And as it has been said:

**"What is the use of all that learning, even if it is as vast as a mountain of straw? Where there is no knowledge of this, that one should not inflict pain on others, that learning is useless."**

Page #502:
---------------------------
The Sutra of the Sutra-Kritanga, this is the essence of the Samaya-Agam, the indication, or the word, the form, thus, this non-violence Samaya, this much is known, what else is there to know? With this much knowledge, the seeker of liberation, the completion of the desired work, therefore, one should not harm anyone.
Commentary: In support of non-violence, the Sutra-kar states: Here, the word "khu" is used in the sense of ornamentation or affirmation of the sentence. The cessation of the killing of living beings, as described earlier, is the true nature of the knower, the essence of the knower who knows the karmic bondage that results from their killing, this is the main duty. In order to show respect for non-violence, the same thing is said again: Those who consider suffering to be undesirable, who desire happiness, not killing them is the essence of the knowledge of the wise man, his success or meaningfulness. In other words, to be free from the killing of living beings is the essence of the knowledge of the knower. To refrain from harming other beings is true knowledge. Therefore, it is said: What is the use of reading millions of words like straw and chaff? The one who reads them has not even understood that one should not cause suffering to anyone else. This is the indication, the teaching of the Agam or scripture, which is based on non-violence. Knowing this much is sufficient. What will be achieved by knowing many things through other diverse knowledge? Because the desired purpose of the seeker of liberation, the seeker of liberation, is fulfilled by this much. Therefore, one should not harm any living being.
Urdu: O you who are in the sky, who are on the earth, who are in the air.
Refrain from all, peace is said to be liberation. ||11||
Shadow: Those who are above, below, and sideways, who are stationary.
One should refrain from all, peace is said to be liberation.
Translation: Those who live in the sky, below, or sideways, who are stationary, one should refrain from harming them all. From this, one attains peaceful liberation. It is said so.
Commentary: Now, referring to the killing of beings in the field, it is said: Those who are above, below, and sideways, who are stationary: those who are fire, air, and two-sensed, and those who are stationary: earth, etc., what more need be said? One should know, one should refrain from killing all living beings, whether they are stationary, subtle, or of the nature of a cloud. He who does so is truly a knower. This cessation of killing is the cause of peace for others and for oneself, because one who refrains from killing does not fear others, nor does he fear anyone else in any future life. Moreover, since the cessation of killing is the sole cause of liberation, liberation is also the cessation of killing, or peace, tranquility, cessation, liberation, and the cessation of anger and delusion, which are the causes of peace, are also the causes of liberation. ||11||

---------------------------
The wise one who follows the path is knowledgeable. To refrain from harming living beings is the cause of peace for oneself and others - it is the form of peace. Those who refrain from violence are not feared by others. They are also not afraid of anyone in the next life - in another birth. Refraining from harming living beings is the main cause of attaining liberation. Therefore, it is the form of liberation or the cessation of peace, anger, etc., detachment or nirvana. A man who refrains from harming living beings does not have agitated or angry thoughts, he is peaceful and happy. He experiences true peace and happiness.

The Lord, having rejected faults, does not oppose anyone. Neither in thought, word, nor deed, forever. - 12

Commentary: The Lord is one who has conquered his senses, or one who is capable of protecting the path to liberation by overcoming the obstacles of restraint. Such a Lord, having rejected faults - falsehood, non-restraint, carelessness, passions, and their combinations - does not oppose any living being. He does not engage in conflict with anyone, in any of the three ways - through thought, word, or deed, for the rest of his life. He does not oppose anyone by harming them. - 12

The wise one who is restrained, patient, and accepts only what is given to him, should avoid what is not given. He should always be content with what is given and avoid what is not given. - 13

Page #504:
---------------------------
The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra Commentary - The monk who is restrained by the cessation of the inflow and the restraint of the senses, is endowed with great wisdom. This is the meaning of "Mahapragna" (great wisdom) and "Vipulabuddhi" (vast intellect). By this, he knows the nature of the soul and non-soul. It is said, "Dhira" (steadfast) is not disturbed by hunger, thirst, and other afflictions. This is what the Sutra shows - when food, clothing, bedding, etc., are given by their owner or by someone instructed by their owner, he examines them and accepts only what is "Eshaniya" (blameless). He is well-versed in the three types of "Eshana" (seeking, investigation, and taking), and being always engaged in "Eshana", he avoids "Aneshana" (non-seeking) and practices restraint. This is to be understood as being in accordance with the other "Samiti" (principles) like "Irya Samiti" (principle of walking), etc., as they are indicative of the same principle. ||13||

Commentary - The virtuous person who is restrained from sins by the cessation of the inflow and the restraint of the senses, is endowed with great wisdom. He is the knower of the soul, non-soul, and other entities. He is not disturbed by hunger, thirst, and other afflictions. The Sutra-maker explains this by saying that he accepts food, clothing, bedding, etc., only after examining them, when they are given by their owner or by someone instructed by their owner. The virtuous person who is well-versed in the three types of "Eshana" (seeking, investigation, and taking), and being always engaged in "Eshana", avoids "Aneshana" (non-seeking) and practices restraint. He is also in accordance with the other "Samiti" (principles) like "Irya Samiti" (principle of walking), etc., as they are indicative of the same principle. This is to be known.

"Bhuyaim cha samarabham, tamuhissa ya jam kadam. Tarisan tu na ginheja, annapanam susanjae." ||14||

Shadow - "Bhutani cha samarabham, tamuddisyacha. Yat kritam. Tadrisan tu na grhniyad annapanam susanyata."

Translation - The virtuous person who is restrained should not accept food and drink that has been prepared for them by those who have caused harm to living beings.

Commentary - The Sutra-maker now speaks about the avoidance of food that is "Aneshaniya" (blameless). Those who were in the past, are in the present, and will be in the future are called "Bhut" (beings). They are living beings. The food and other things that are prepared for the virtuous person by those who have caused harm to living beings through their "Samarabham" (actions), "Samarabham" (actions), and "Aarabham" (actions) are contaminated by the "Adha Karma" (evil karma) of their intention. Therefore, the virtuous person who is engaged in the highest austerity should not consume such food and drink. The word "Tu" here means "only". This means that the virtuous person should never consume such food. By doing so, he follows the path of liberation - he perfectly follows the path of liberation.

Page #505:
---------------------------
The Jain should not partake in any food that has even a single particle of food that is contaminated with the five great sins (Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya, Brahmacharya, Aparigraha). This is the dharma of the one who is truly restrained. Even if there is doubt about the purity of the food, the Jain should not accept it.

The Jain should not allow any living being to be harmed in the places where they reside, whether it be in villages, towns, or cities. The Jain who is truly restrained, who has conquered their senses, and who is pure in thought, word, and deed, will not allow such an act.

Page #506:
---------------------------
The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra states that if someone desires to dig a well, build a pond, construct a water fountain, or run a food distribution center, and inquires of a Sadhu whether there is merit in such actions, or even if they do not inquire, the Sadhu should not permit such actions to a person who is engaged in violence against living beings.

When the question arises, "How should it be?" the solution is given as follows: A Sadhu who is free from the sins of self-concealment in thought, word, and deed, and who has conquered the senses, should not permit such actions.

The Sutra further states that one should avoid giving permission for such actions.

"Even if someone starts to dig a well, do not say that there is merit in it. Or, if there is no merit, do not say so. This is a great fear."

The commentary explains that if a king or someone else asks a Sadhu whether there is merit in digging a well or running a food distribution center, the Sadhu, upon hearing such words, should not agree to either of the answers, "There is merit" or "There is no merit," because both are fraught with great fear and fault.

"Those who are killed for the sake of giving food and water, whether they are mobile or immobile, are killed for their protection. Therefore, do not say that there is merit in such actions."

The commentary explains that the Sadhu should not agree to such actions because they involve the killing of mobile and immobile beings for the sake of providing food and water. The Sadhu, being self-controlled and having conquered the senses, should not say that there is merit in such actions.

Page #507:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Commentary on the Text:**

Why should one not approve of this? The solution is that food is prepared through actions like cooking and baking for the purpose of feeding, and digging wells, etc., are necessary for providing water. In these actions, many stationary and mobile beings are killed and destroyed. Therefore, for the sake of their protection, a self-controlled, restrained ascetic should not say that there is merit in your actions.

**Verse 19:**

**Verse:** Those who provide food and water in this way, they are causing harm to those who benefit from it. Therefore, one should not say that there is no merit in it.

**Commentary:** Even if one were to say that there is no merit, one should not say that either. The verse says, "Those" beings, for whom "that" food and water, etc., are provided by those who are wise in Dharma, they produce this kind of food and water, which is tainted by the fault of harming living beings. Because of the prohibition of this, "their" (those who seek food and water) "benefit is obstructed" (they are harmed). In the absence of this, they would suffer. Therefore, one should not say that there is no merit in digging wells, performing sacrifices, etc.

**Commentary on the Text:**

One should say that there is no merit, but one should not say that. In this way, the explanation of what is said is as follows: Those who, with a sense of Dharma, provide food and water, etc., to living beings, their actions are tainted by the fault of harming living beings. By prohibiting this, there is an obstruction or hindrance to the benefit of those who desire food and water. In the absence of this, they would suffer. Therefore, one should not say that there is no merit in digging wells, running farms, etc.

**Verse 20:**

**Verse:** Those who praise giving, they desire the killing of beings. Those who oppose giving, they destroy the livelihood of beings.

**Commentary:** To explain this same meaning more concisely and clearly, the verse says: Those who praise giving, like sacrifices, etc., because it benefits many beings, they are praising it. Those who are truly knowledgeable, they desire the killing of beings through the praise of giving, because giving cannot exist without killing. Those who think, "We are subtle-minded," and are ignorant of the true nature of the scriptures, they destroy the livelihood of beings.

Page #508:
---------------------------
Here is the English translation, preserving the Jain terms:

The Sutrakritanga Sutra states, "They prohibit and forbid, but they too are ignorant of the true meaning. They obstruct the livelihood (vrittichhedaṃ) and means of subsistence of living beings." (20)

Thus, the king or another wealthy person, who is engaged in digging wells, ponds, performing yajnas, running agricultural fields, etc. for the purpose of acquiring merit, asks the mumukṣus (aspirants for liberation) about the merit in these activities. In response, the Sutrakara (author of the Sutras) explains what should be done and said.

"They do not speak in either way, whether there is or there is not merit again.
Abandoning the impurity of karma, they attain nirvāṇa." (21)

Commentary: The monks do not say whether there is merit in food-related or water-related donations or not. They, the faultless speakers, having abandoned the impurity of karma, attain nirvāṇa.

If the monks were to say that there is merit, then it would imply that the destruction of infinite subtle and gross living beings is always there, and only a few get temporary satisfaction. Therefore, they do not say "there is merit" or "there is no merit." This is because if they negate the merit, it would create an obstacle for those who desire it.

Thus, the monks remain silent on this matter. Our diet, free from the forty-two faults, is appropriate for the aspirants of liberation, as it is said:

"Drinking the cool water, white as the rays of the moon, from the wells and ponds, the groups of living beings become delighted in mind, their thirst completely quenched. When the flood of water is dried up by the rays of the sun, the endless (living beings) go to destruction. Therefore, the group of monks remains indifferent towards the wells and ponds, etc." (1)

In this way, in both cases, by remaining silent, they abandon the impurity of karma and attain nirvāṇa.

Page #509:
---------------------------
**Shri Margadhyayanam**

Do not state that there is merit in this.  There is no merit in these acts of charity - when such a prohibitive statement is made, it creates an obstacle or hindrance for those who benefit from the charity. Therefore, seekers aspiring for liberation do not say that there is merit, nor do they say that there is sin. When asked by anyone, they take refuge in silence. If someone insists excessively, the sage should only say, "For us, forty-two faults are considered forbidden food." We, the seekers of liberation, have no right to speak on such matters.

It is said that creatures quench their thirst by freely drinking the cool, pure water of lakes, like the rays of the moon. They are happy in their minds. This is true. But when the water of the lake dries up due to the rays of the sun, countless creatures perish. Therefore, the monks remain indifferent and neutral in matters of wells, lakes, etc. Knowing that speaking in both ways creates karmic bondage, the sage avoids karmic bondage by remaining silent in this regard or by speaking without fault, without sin, and thus attains liberation.

**Nirvana is the supreme, like the moon among the stars. Therefore, the sage, always restrained, should strive for Nirvana.**

**Commentary:**

Nirvana, the state of liberation, is the supreme, the most important for those who are seeking liberation, the Buddhas. They are the Buddhas, the ones who are primarily focused on Nirvana. This is illustrated by the example of the moon: just as the moon is the most prominent among the stars, like Ashwini, due to its auspiciousness, its ability to measure, and its illumination, so too, among those who seek liberation, the Buddhas, those who have renounced the desire for heavenly realms and the position of a universal monarch, and who are engaged in the practice of Nirvana, the complete destruction of karma, are the most prominent, not others. Or, just as the moon is the most prominent among the stars, so too, the Buddhas, who have realized the truth, declare that Nirvana is the supreme, the most important in the world. Since Nirvana is the most important, therefore, the sage, always, at all times, with effort, with restraint of the senses, should strive for Nirvana. 

**Commentary on the Commentary:**

Nirvana is called liberation, the state of peace. Those who seek liberation, the Buddhas, who are knowledgeable about the truth, are the most prominent, the best, or the most excellent, because they consider Nirvana to be the most important, the most excellent, and because they are advocates of Nirvana. The author of the sutra presents this by way of an example: just as the moon is the most prominent among the stars, like Ashwini, due to its auspiciousness, its ability to measure, and its illumination, so too, among those who seek liberation, the enlightened ones, those who have renounced the desire for heavenly realms and the position of a universal monarch, and who are engaged in the practice of liberation, the complete destruction of karma, are the most excellent, not others. Or, just as the moon is the most prominent among the stars, so too, the Buddhas, who have realized the truth, declare that liberation is the supreme, the most important in the world.

Page #510:
---------------------------
Just as the moon is the best among the celestial bodies, so too is liberation the best and most excellent. This is what the wise say. Embracing the supreme excellence of liberation, the virtuous should always remain steadfast in their restraint, controlling their senses and mind, and performing all the necessary actions for liberation.

"Those who are being carried away by the currents of the ocean of existence, by the streams of false belief, passions, and negligence, and who are being dragged towards that, and who are being degraded by the ripening of their own karmas, and who are without refuge, and who are without good thoughts, for them, the Tīrthankaras, or other compassionate Ganadharas, out of their boundless compassion, declare a beautiful island, a place of refuge. Just as, in the ocean, a creature that has fallen into the water, and who is being tossed about by the waves, and who is exhausted and about to die, is told by a compassionate person to take refuge in an island, so too, for those who are exhausted from wandering in the world, the Tīrthankaras, etc., declare the island of right faith, etc., as a place of rest from the wandering of the world, which has never been declared before by others. And by doing so, they establish the foundation for liberation, which is characterized by the cessation of wandering in the world, and which is attained by the attainment of right faith, etc., and which is declared by the wise to be the most excellent."

"Those who are self-controlled, always restrained, with their karmic currents cut off, and who are free from the flow of karma, and who declare the pure Dharma, and who consider it to be complete, are truly liberated."

**Translation:**

**Chapter 24**

The holy path of knowledge (Margaadhyayanam) teaches the pure and unparalleled Dharma, which is always self-guarded (Aatmagupta), with subdued senses (Daant-Jiteindriya), and free from the sources of false beliefs (Chinnasrot Mithyaatva), and free from the inflow of karmas (Aashrava).

**Commentary:**

What is this island of peace (Aashvaasadweepa)? Who is the person who teaches about it? The sutrakar says: The one whose soul is free from mental, verbal, and physical misconduct (Aatmagupta), who always controls the senses and mind (Daant-Jiteindriya), who is devoted to Dharma and meditation, who has destroyed the sources of the worldly cycle (Chinnasrot), and whose inflow of karmas (Aashrava) like violence (Praanaatipaata) etc. has ceased, such a person teaches the pure Dharma, free from all defects.

What kind of Dharma is it? It is complete (Pratipoorna), free from all parts (Niravayavata), free from all falsehoods (Sarvaviryata), the only cause for liberation (Mokshagamanaikahetu), and unparalleled (Aneedrisham).

**Chapter 25**

Those who do not know this Dharma, who are unwise (Abuddha) but think they are wise (Buddhmaanino), are far away from the true understanding (Samadhi).

**Commentary:**

Those who do not know this pure, complete, and unparalleled Dharma, who are devoid of wisdom (Aprabuddha), who think they are wise (Panditmaanino), and who believe that they are the only ones who know the truth of Dharma, are far away from the true understanding (Samadhi) which is based on right perception (Samyagdarshan). All such people are to be considered as belonging to other religions (Parateerthika).

**Chapter 26**

Those who eat (Bhocca), meditate (Jhaana), and sleep (Jhiyaayamti) without understanding this Dharma, are not in true understanding (Samadhi).

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra states - They who have consumed the food consisting of seeds, water, and that which is dedicated to them, practice Arta-dhyana (meditation on pain and suffering), being devoid of equanimity and unsteady in mind.

Commentary - Why do these Tirthikas (followers of other faiths) remain far from the path of true spiritual contemplation? Apprehending this, the author says - "They" (referring to the Shavaka, Bauddha, etc.) who are ignorant of the true nature of Jiva (living beings) and Ajiva (non-living substances), have consumed the food consisting of "Bijas" (grains like rice, wheat, etc.), "Shitodaka" (cold water), and that which is prepared and dedicated to them by their followers. Having consumed this, they engage in Arta-dhyana (meditation on pain and suffering), being attached to the feelings of pleasure, pride, honor, etc., and not in Dharma-dhyana (meditation on righteousness) like those who desire worldly pleasures and are possessed of servants, slaves, wealth, grains, etc. As it is said - "Where there is possession of a village, field, house, cows, servants, etc., how can there be auspicious meditation?" And also - "Attachment is the abode of delusion, the diminution of fortitude, the adversary of peace, the friend of wickedness, the dwelling of sin, the source of sorrow, the destruction of happiness, the enemy of meditation, and even for the wise, possession is like a disease, leading to affliction or destruction."

Thus, for those engaged in activities like cooking, serving, etc., and contemplating on the same, how can there be the arising of auspicious meditation? Furthermore, these Tirthikas are "Akheda-jnah" (unskilled) in the discrimination of righteousness and unrighteousness. The Shavaka, etc. consider even the enjoyment of delicious food, comfortable dwelling, and luxurious seats as conducive to auspicious meditation, and thus teach the consumption of meat, etc., taking refuge in different designations, and consider the undertaking of activities as faultless, as it is said - "The child, having given up meat-eating, consumes this 'Kalka' (meat-substitute), and thus, abandoning the undertaking, performs it under the pretext of others."

However, this does not make it faultless, for just as the change of designation from 'Luta' (poison) to 'Shitalika' (something cooling) does not make it different, nor does the designation of 'Madhu' (honey) make poison sweet, similarly, the lack of skill in the manifestation and disappearance of terms like Kapila, etc. for other substances is evident. Thus, these wretched Shavaka, etc., being possessed of attachments, engaged in Arta-dhyana, and being far from the state of equanimous spiritual contemplation, remain distant from the path of liberation.

Page #513:
---------------------------
Shri Margadhyayanam is the friend of ego and pride, the abode of sin, the cause of the origin of sorrow, the destroyer of happiness, and a painful enemy for meditation. It torments even the learned like the planets. Therefore, how can auspicious meditation be possible for those who are engaged in activities like cooking, serving food, etc. and are absorbed in the same? They are unskilled in discerning other religious and non-religious doctrines, because they consider the pleasant, delicious food, dwelling, bedding, etc., which are actually passion-producing, as the cause of auspicious meditation. As they say, auspicious meditation is attained by the consumption of dear, delicious food, etc. They give the term "Kalkika" to meat and consider it innocent. They consider the acts of violence, etc. undertaken for the sake of the Buddhist Sangha as innocent. It is said that the ignorant, while refraining from meat, still consume it by giving it the name "Kalkika." They abandon the beginning (of violence) and do the same under the pretext of others, such as the Sangha, etc. But by merely changing the name, the fault is not removed. Just as calling the excessive heat of summer as "coolness" does not change its quality, or calling poison as nectar does not make it nectar, similarly, it should be known that this is the ineptitude of the Kapila doctrine followers, the Sankhyas, who expound the terms "manifestation" and "disappearance" for origination and destruction. The unrestrained Buddhists and others, who indulge in pleasant, delightful, and recommended food, remain far from the samadhi leading to the path of liberation due to the lack of restraint and impurity.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra with Commentary - English Translation

**Commentary:** The first ones described are those who are attached to the other doctrines, being filled with the taste of the tongue, pleasure and pride, and are engaged in the thought of suffering. To explain this by an example, the Sutrakar states. Here, the word 'Yatha' is used to indicate an example. In a reservoir, various birds like the Dhak, etc., who are dependent on the water, are always engaged in the thought of catching fish, which is very polluted and low, and is characterized by suffering and anger.

**Explanation of the example:** Just as the Dhak, etc., birds are engaged in the thought of catching fish, similarly, some Buddhists, etc., who are of false vision, are called Shramanas, but are un-Aryan and low, due to their un-Aryan and low actions, and due to being engrossed in the beginning and acquisition, are always engaged in the thought of obtaining objects like words, etc., and enjoyments. They are polluted and low, just like the Dhak birds.

**Sutra:** 
> "**Sudham maggam virahitta, ihamege u dummati. Ummagagata dukkham, ghayamesanti tam taha.**" (29)

**Commentary:** 
> "**Shuddham marg viradhya, iha eke tu durmatayah. Ummarg gata dukkham ghatameshyanti, tat tatha.**"

**Translation:** In this world, some who are of false vision, with corrupted minds, or those who are engrossed in falsehood, reject the pure and faultless path of liberation, and are engaged in the path of error, and thus they attain suffering and destruction.

**Commentary:** 'Shuddham' means faultless, 'marg' means the path of liberation, which is based on right vision, etc. By rejecting the path of liberation and adopting the path of error, 'iha' in this world, in the context of the presentation of the path of liberation, 'eke' like the Shakyas, etc., are those whose minds are corrupted by excessive delusion due to their attachment to their own vision, and due to the acceptance of evil means, their minds are corrupted. They are engaged in the path of error, which leads to the descent into the world. 'Ummarg gata' means those who are engaged in the path of error, 'dukkham' means suffering, which is in the form of the eight types of karma, or the suffering of birth, etc. 'Ghatam' means destruction, and 'eshanta' means they seek, they desire, meaning they seek suffering and death hundreds of times.

**Commentary:** The path of liberation is free from faults, and is based on right vision, etc. The Shakyas, etc., reject this path by presenting the path of error, which is evil and false. In this world, in the context of presenting the path of liberation, their hearts are corrupted by excessive delusion due to their attachment to their own vision, and due to the acceptance of evil means, their minds are corrupted. They walk on the path that leads to the descent into the world, they are engaged in the path of error, which leads to the binding of the eight types of karma. They suffer due to the arising of the unbearable karma. They desire to continue on the path of error, rejecting the path of liberation. They seek suffering and death hundreds of times, and they obtain it due to their actions.

**Sutra:**
> "**Jaha asavini nam, jai andho duruhiya. Icchai parama gantu, antara ya visiyati.**" (30)

> "**Evam tu samana ege, micchaditthi anariya. Soyam kasina mavanna, agantaro mahabbhayam.**" (31)

**Shadow:** Just as a blind man, who has boarded a leaky boat, desires to cross the river, but sinks in the middle, so too, some Shramanas, who are of false views and un-Aryan, having taken in all the Asravas, attain great fear.

**Translation:** Just as a man blind from birth, who boards a leaky boat, desires to cross the river, but sinks in the middle, so too, some Shramanas, who are of false views and un-Aryan, having taken in all the Asravas, attain great fear.

**Commentary:** To show the downfall of the Shakyas and others, the Sutra-maker says: Just as a blind man from birth, having boarded a leaky boat with hundreds of holes, desires to cross the river, but because of the holes, he cannot cross, what then? He sinks in the middle.

**Commentary:** The Dartantika says: In the same way, some Shramanas, the Shakyas and others, who are of false views and un-Aryan, having taken in all the Asravas, which are in the form of karma, attain great fear. They become those who come to the great fear, which is the suffering of hell and other states, due to repeated wandering in the cycle of existence. They do not have the crossing of the ocean of existence, like those who have a boat that is not leaky.

**Commentary:** To show the downfall or destruction of the Shakyas and others, the Sutra-maker explains through an example: A man blind from birth, having boarded a boat with hundreds of holes, desires to cross the river, but because of the holes in the boat, he cannot cross, and sinks in the middle.

**Commentary:** Explaining the essence of this example, the Sutra-maker says: In the same way, Shramanas who are of false views and un-Aryan, like the Buddhists, who are completely immersed in the source of the Asravas, which are the karmic inflows, wander repeatedly in the cycle of existence and experience the suffering of hell and other states. Just as those who are on a leaky boat cannot cross the ocean of existence.

**Shadow:** Having taken this Dharma, which was preached by Kashyapa, one should cross this terrible flow, and should strive for self-preservation.

**Translation:** Having taken this Dharma, which was preached by Kashyapa, one should cross this terrible flow, and should strive for self-preservation.

**Commentary:** Because the Shramanas, like the Shakyas, are of false views and un-Aryan, and have taken in all the Asravas, they become those who come to great fear. Therefore, this is advised: "This" refers to what is immediately present, and what is to be explained later. This is a characteristic that is manifest to all beings, and is beautiful because it prevents downfall and establishes good conduct. The word "Dharma" refers to the teachings and conduct, and it shows a difference from what was said before. Because those who do not take in the Dharma of purity and renunciation of the Asravas, become those who come to great fear, one should take in this Dharma, which was preached by Kashyapa, the glorious...

The Sutra Kritanga Sutra, revealed by Vardhamana Swami, explains how to cross the stream of emotions, the nature of worldly wandering. It describes this world as "mahaghora," extremely terrifying due to its difficulty to overcome, and its inhabitants, who experience endless suffering, moving from womb to womb, birth to birth, death to death, and pain to pain, like a wheel constantly turning. 

Therefore, the Dharma revealed by Kashyap provides protection for the soul. To achieve this self-protection, one should embrace the path of restraint, becoming a practitioner of self-control. In some versions, the second half of the verse reads, "Kujja bhikkhu gilanas, agilae samahie," meaning that a virtuous monk should care for a sick monk with unwavering dedication, bringing peace and tranquility to the sick one's mind.

The text then explains how to practice restraint:

"Virae gamadhammehi, je kei jagai jaga. Tesim attuvamayae, tham kuvvam parivvae."

This translates to: "A virtuous person, abstaining from worldly desires, should consider all beings as equal to themselves and practice restraint with determination."

The commentary explains that worldly desires are like objects of the senses, and those who are attached to them are like those who are trapped in the world. They experience suffering and hatred, and a virtuous person should not create more suffering for them but instead strive to protect them. By practicing restraint, they can achieve this goal.

Page #517:
---------------------------
**Shri Margadhyayanam**

The words, objects of the senses, and the rules of conduct are called the objects of study. There are some ascetics who are detached and withdrawn from them. That is, they do not have attachment to pleasing objects like words, etc., for the mind, nor aversion to painful objects. Those beings who live in the belly of the world are all living beings - they live for the sake of living. They hate suffering - they do not want suffering. Therefore, understanding those beings as equal to oneself, the ascetic should not cause them suffering, but should manifest his strength and power for their protection and practice restraint. Om Om Om

**Chhaya**

**Anuvaad Pandit** - The wise ascetic, understanding the nature of pride and illusion, and abandoning them, should be devoted to the practice of liberation.

**Pandit. Muni ||34||**

**Atimaanachcha Maayaaschcha Tatparijnaaya Panditah. Sarvametanniraakrutya, Nirvaanam Sandhayenmunih.**

**Tika** - To remove the obstacles to restraint, the sutrakar says - One who transgresses and destroys the code of conduct due to excessive pride is called atimaan. The word 'cha' used here also includes anger. Atimaaya and the word 'cha' include excessive greed. This kshaya is the enemy, the opponent of restraint. Therefore, the wise, discerning muni should abandon these kshayas, which are the cause of the world, and seek liberation. With the presence of kshayas, restraint cannot be fully successful. It is said:

"Saamannamanucharantaassa, Kasaaya Jassa Ukkadaa Honti. Mannaami Ucchupupham Va, Nishphalam Tassa Saamannam. ||1||"

**Chhaya** - The asceticism of one whose kshayas are strong is like the flower of sugarcane, useless.

**Tannishphalatve Cha Na Moksha Sambhav, Tathaacho Ktam**

"Sansaraadapalaayana Prati Bhuvo Raagadayo Me Sthitaastrishna Bandhanabadhyamaanam Akhilam Kim Vetsi Nedam Jagat? | Mrityo! Munja Jaraakarena Parusham Kesheshuu Maa Maa Grahirehi Tyadar Mantrena Bhavatha Kim Naagamiishyami Aham? ||1||"

And so on. Therefore, the abandonment of such kshayas and the contemplation of noble qualities is the best way to seek liberation. ||34||

**Tikaarth** - To remove the defects that create obstacles in restraint, the sutrakar says -

One who transgresses and destroys the code of conduct due to excessive pride is called atimaan. The word 'cha' used here also includes anger. Atimaaya and the word 'cha' include excessive greed. This kshaya is the enemy, the opponent of restraint. Therefore, the wise, discerning muni should abandon these kshayas, which are the cause of the world, and seek liberation. He should be devoted to the path of liberation. With the presence of kshayas, restraint cannot be fully successful. Therefore, it is said:

The asceticism, the life of a shraman, the practice of restraint, of one whose kshayas are strong and persistent, is like the flower of sugarcane, useless. With the failure of asceticism, liberation is not possible. Therefore, it is said - O Death! The attachment, etc., that prevent me from escaping the world are present in me.

The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states that this entire world is bound by the chains of **trishna** (desire). Do you not know this? Therefore, do not grab my hair with the hand of old age. Leave them, come - even without being called respectfully, will I not come to you? Therefore, a **sadhu** (holy person) should be eager to engage in the practice of **moksha** (liberation) with a **chinn-paripurna** (unbroken and complete) and **prashasta** (excellent) attitude, abandoning **kashayas** (passions). This is the best course for them.

**Sandhaye sahadhammam cha, pavadhammam nirakare. Uvanaviriye bhikkhu, koham manam na patthae.** ||35||

**Translation:** The **bhikkhu** (monk) should cultivate **sadhu dharma** (virtuous conduct) like **kshanta** (patience) and other excellent virtues, and abandon sinful actions. The **bhikkhu** who is strong in **upadhana** (effort) should abandon **krodha** (anger) and **mana** (pride).

**Commentary:** The **sadhu**'s dharma is **kshanta** (patience) and other virtues, or it is **samyak darshan** (right faith), **samyak jnana** (right knowledge), and **samyak charitra** (right conduct). The **sadhu** should cultivate it, increase it. They should increase their knowledge by acquiring new knowledge every moment, and by eliminating defects like doubt, they should acquire **samyak jiva** (right understanding of the soul) and other objects of knowledge, and thus increase their **samyak darshan**. They should cultivate **charitra** by fully observing the **mula guna** (root virtues) and **uttar guna** (secondary virtues) without any deviation, and by accepting new **abhigraha** (vows) every day. There is another reading, "**Saddhe sadhu dhammam cha**". This means that the **sadhu** should have faith in the **sadhu dharma** described above, which is the path to **moksha**, and should accept it without doubt. According to the word "**cha**" used here, they should follow that dharma correctly. They should abandon the dharma that is the cause of **papa** (sin), which is based on the oppression and violence of living beings. The **bhikkhu** who is strong in **upadhana** (effort) should not desire or cultivate **krodha** (anger) and **mana** (pride).

**Commentary meaning:** The **sadhu** has ten types of dharma, such as **kshanta** (patience) and **kshama** (forgiveness), or their dharma is **samyak darshan** (right faith), **samyak jnana** (right knowledge), and **samyak charitra** (right conduct). The **sadhu** should cultivate it, increase it. They should increase their knowledge by acquiring new knowledge every moment, and by eliminating defects like doubt, they should acquire **samyak jiva** (right understanding of the soul) and other objects of knowledge, and thus increase their **samyak darshan**. They should cultivate **charitra** by fully observing the **mula guna** (root virtues) and **uttar guna** (secondary virtues) without any deviation, and by accepting new **abhigraha** (vows) every day. There is another reading, "**Saddhe sadhu dhammam cha**". This means that the **sadhu** should have faith in the **sadhu dharma** described above, which is the path to **moksha**, and should accept it without doubt. According to the word "**cha**" used here, they should follow that dharma correctly. They should abandon the dharma that is the cause of **papa** (sin), which is based on the oppression and violence of living beings. The **bhikkhu** who is strong in **upadhana** (effort) should not desire or cultivate **krodha** (anger) and **mana** (pride).

**Je ya buddha atikkanta, je ya buddha anagaya. Santi tesim paittanam, bhuyanam jagati jaha.** ||36||

**Translation:** Those **buddhas** (enlightened ones) who have passed away, and those **buddhas** who are yet to come, their foundation is peace, just as it is for all beings in the world.

Page #519:
---------------------------
**Shri Margadhyayan Translation**

The foundation or basis of all the Tirthankaras who have been in the past and who will be in the future is peace. Just as this world is the basis of beings.

**Commentary**

Is this path of peace only taught by Vardhamana Swami or by other Tirthankaras as well? To address this doubt, the sutrakar says:

In the beginningless past, countless Tirthankaras have passed away, all of them have expounded this path of peace. Similarly, in the future, countless Tirthankaras will also expound this path of peace. The word "cha" indicates that the Tirthankaras present in the current time also expound this path.

They have not only expounded this path but also practiced it in their lives. The sutrakar points this out by saying:

Shaman, the pacification of passions, is peace. That is the path of peace. It is the foundation or basis of the Tirthankaras of the past, present, and future. Because without it, Buddhahood cannot be attained. Or, if peace is liberation, which is the foundation or basis of all Tirthankaras, then it is attained through this path of peace. Therefore, all Tirthankaras have spoken of this path of peace and practiced it.

To illustrate the foundation of peace, the sutrakar says:

Just as the three worlds are the foundation of beings, similarly, peace is the foundation of all Tirthankaras.

To show what should be done by one who has accepted the path of peace, the sutrakar says:

**Commentary**

If a sadhu who has accepted vows is touched by high and low, various kinds of trials and tribulations, then just as a great mountain does not fall from the wind, similarly, the sadhu should not be disturbed by restraint.

Page #520:
---------------------------
##  The Sutra Kritanga Sutra with Commentary - Chapter 37

**Commentary:** After attaining the path of liberation, a virtuous person who has taken vows may be afflicted by various types of small and large **parishahas** and **upsargas**.  He should endure them, keeping in mind the nature of the world and the destruction of karma. He should not be swayed by these favorable or unfavorable **upsargas** in his practice of **samyama**.  Just as the great mountain Meru is not shaken by the mighty wind, so too should he remain unshaken.  He should gradually practice overcoming **parishahas** and **upsargas**, for even difficult tasks become easy with practice.  Here is an example:  A cowherd lifts a calf born that day and brings it near the cow, and then takes it back.  In this way, he continues to lift and bring the calf back, even as it grows larger day by day, until it is two years old and then three years old.  Similarly, a virtuous person, through constant practice, gradually overcomes **parishahas** and **upsargas**.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra with Commentary - Chapter 38

**Verse:** 
> संवुडे से महापन्ने, धीरे दत्तेसणं चरे । निव्वुडे कालमाकंखी, एवं (यं) केवलिणो मयं ॥३८॥त्तिबेमि॥ 

**Shadow:** 
> संवृत्तः स महाप्राज्ञः, धीरो दत्तैषणां चरेत् ।
> निवृतः कालमाकाङ्क्ष देवं केवलिनो मतम् ॥इति ब्रवीमि॥ 

**Translation:** 
> The wise and restrained one, with great wisdom, should patiently accept the food and other things given by others.  He should be calm and desire the time of death.  This is the opinion of the omniscient one.

**Commentary:**  Continuing the discussion, the text says:  This virtuous person, with his senses restrained, is wise and has great knowledge.  He is patient and calm, and he should accept the food and other things given by others, while remaining committed to **samyama**.  He should be calm and desire the time of death.  This is the opinion of the omniscient one, the **Tirthankara**.  This is said by Sudharma Swami, addressing Jambuswami.  What you have learned about the path is not my own opinion, but the opinion of the omniscient one.  Therefore, you should accept it as such.  This concludes the discussion.

**End of the Eleventh Study of the Path**

Page #521:
---------------------------
Shri Margadhyayanam Teekaarth - The Sutrakar now tells the remaining things to be said to complete this study - accept only the food that is worthy of being eaten, given by a virtuous person who is free from fear, calm, patient, or unperturbed by obstacles and afflictions, who has restrained the *ashrava* doors, and who is endowed with *samvara*, great wisdom, *samyakdarshan* and knowledge. He should observe restraint, being filled with various *eshana*. Having become calm due to the pacification of the *kashya*, that virtuous person should desire the time of death. What I have said before is the opinion of the Kevali Bhagavan. This is what Shri Sudharmaswami tells Shri Jambuswami. The answer to your question about the nature of the path, I have not given from my own mind - I have not said it from my own side, but have stated the opinion of the Kevali Bhagavan. Accept this. Here, the word *iti* means completion. *Bravimi* - I speak - is as before.

The eleventh study, named *Marg*, is complete.

## The Twelfth Chapter of the Sutra Kritanga Sutra, The Study of the Four Samvasaranas

**Four Samvasaranas are there, which the Pravadukas speak of separately. They are Kriyavada, Akriyavada, Vinayavada, and the fourth is Ajnanavada.**

**Commentary:** This chapter is connected to the previous chapter, which states that a Sadhu who has attained the path of liberation should recognize and avoid the Pravadukas who follow the wrong path. This chapter explains their nature. This chapter is also connected to the next chapter, which states that a Samvrita (one who has controlled his senses), Mahaprajna (one with great wisdom), Vira (a hero), should accept food and other things offered by others without any fault, and should be free from passions and desires, and should desire the time of death. This is the statement of the Kevali (the omniscient one). He should also avoid other Tirthankaras. This is also the opinion of the Kevali. Therefore, to avoid them, their nature is being explained here. The word "Chatvari" (four) is used to exclude other numbers. The Pravadukas speak of four types of Samvasaranas, which are the principles accepted by other Tirthankaras. These are described by the Sutrakar using names that are synonymous with their meaning. For example, those who say that only action exists are called Kriyavadins. Those who say that action does not exist are called Akriyavadins. The third are the Vinayikas, and the fourth are the Ajnanikas.

**Those who are not good are not considered good, and they do not understand the truth. They are called Akaviyas by the Akaviyas, and they speak falsehood.**

The study of the Shri Samavasharan reveals that the ignorant, although they consider themselves skilled, are partially untruthful, immersed in doubt and uncertainty, ignorant, and instruct the ignorant students. They speak falsehoods without contemplating the true reality.

Commentary: Thus, the author first generally criticizes the proponents of action, inaction, and ignorance, and then proceeds to present their viewpoint in order to refute it. He says that those who are ignorant, i.e., the Ajnanikās, are completely incoherent in their statements. Therefore, he first introduces them as those in whom there is ignorance, i.e., the Ajnanikās or the ignorant ones, who act out of ignorance. 

These Ajnanikās, although claiming to be skilled, are 'Asamstutas', i.e., incoherent, as they consider ignorance as the highest good. Due to this incoherence, they are 'Vichikitsachittaviplutih', i.e., afflicted by the disturbance of doubt and uncertainty in their minds. The Jnanis (the wise) contradict each other, as some say the self is all-pervasive, while others say it is not all-pervasive; some say it is the size of a thumb, while others say it is as small as a mustard seed; some say it is material, others say it is immaterial and situated in the heart. Thus, there is no unanimity among them, and there is no one who can be considered the supreme knower whose words can be taken as authoritative, as it is said that the omniscient one cannot know the omniscient.

Therefore, true knowledge alone is the highest good, as even if an ignorant person were to strike his head with his foot, he would not incur such faults as one afflicted by the disturbance of the mind. Thus, these proponents of ignorance are incoherent and have not crossed the ocean of doubt and uncertainty.

These Ajnanikās are 'Akovidah', i.e., unskilled, lacking in true understanding. What they have said, that the Jnanis contradict each other and are not speaking the truth, is not correct. The proponents of the acceptance of the scriptures revealed by the omniscient do not contradict each other, as their acceptance of the omniscient's teachings precludes any mutual contradiction, since the omniscience of the omniscient cannot be refuted.

The English translation preserving the Jain terms is as follows:

The Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra has arisen due to the power of similarity, but there is no such similarity by which it could be established in the absence of omniscience. Nor is it through arthapatti (implication), as that too is based on pratyaksha (direct perception) and other pramanas (valid means of knowledge), and the pramanas themselves do not establish it. Nor is it through agama (scriptural testimony), as that too is seen to establish omniscience. Nor does the absence of the panchaka pramanas (five valid means of knowledge) establish the absence of omniscience, because it is not possible to say that there is no pramana that can grasp it everywhere and at all times. For, the knowledge of persons remote in place and time can be grasped, and grasping that would lead to their omniscience, and the knowledge of the ordinary people does not negate omniscience as it is not all-pervasive, and the negation of the non-all-pervasive does not lead to the negation of the object. Nor is the absence in the form of the knowledge of another substance sufficient to establish the absence of omniscience, as there is no obstruction to the contact of omniscience with another substance. Thus, since there is no counter-evidence and the possibility of the existence of the Sarvagya (Omniscient) has been established, and since the acceptance of the agamas (scriptures) propounded by him, the fault of difference of opinion is far removed. Thus, according to the proponents of the agamas accepted by him, the Jiva (soul) that is bound in the Samsara (cycle of birth and death) is only body-pervading, and the knowledge of its attributes is obtained there itself. And the fallacy of mutual dependence also does not arise here, because the extraordinary knowledge observed in the cultivated intellect is also seen in one's own self, and what is observed cannot be said to be unreal. And what has been said, that "knowledge is not able to comprehend the nature of the knowable, due to the obstruction everywhere by division", this is mere verbosity, because there is no possibility of obstruction in the knowledge that grasps even the things separated by place and time, and even the knowledge of the ordinary people has obstruction through the doors of the limbs, for the limbed does not get obstructed by its own limbs. And as for the statement "ignorance alone is the best", is this a prasajya-pratishedha (simple negation) or a paryudasa (exclusive negation)? If ignorance is other than knowledge, then by the paryudasa method, another knowledge would be resorted to, not the doctrine of ignorance. And if there is no knowledge, then ignorance being empty, formless, and devoid of all potency, how can it be the best? And by the prasajya-pratishedha of "ignorance is the best", a negation of the action of knowledge being the best would be made, which is contradicted by direct perception, because the one who acts with right knowledge does not contradict the desired result. Moreover, even by accepting that ignorance is the best, just as in the case of a small defect in touching the head with the foot, it is recognized, so here too the contradiction with the acceptance would be direct, not inferential. Thus, these ignorance-advocates, being incompetent themselves, have taught the doctrine of ignorance to their own incompetent disciples, and the use of the singular number in the sutra is due to the calmness of mind. Even the Shramanas are mostly ignorant, as they accept that the karma (action) accumulated without knowledge does not lead to bondage, and those who consider the unclear consciousness of the child, the intoxicated, and the sleeping as non-binding, they all should be seen as incompetent. And due to the adoption of the ignorance standpoint, without deliberation, they always speak falsely, because deliberation occurs in the presence of knowledge, and truth-speaking is preceded by it, so the absence of deliberation due to the non-acceptance of knowledge, and the absence of that leads to their falsehood.

---------------------------
The soul, the object of study in Samvasarana, is like the joint of the thumb. Many consider it to be as small as a grain of rice from the Shyamaka variety. Some consider it to be concrete, while others consider it to be abstract. Some say that the soul resides in the middle of the heart, while others say that it resides in the forehead. Thus, even regarding the soul, which is the most prominent of all substances, there is no single opinion or statement among the knowers. There is no one in the world who is exceptionally knowledgeable or extraordinarily wise whose words can be considered as proof. Even if there is someone who is exceptionally knowledgeable, they cannot be known by a person of limited knowledge, because it is said that one who is not omniscient cannot know the omniscient. Even if there is an omniscient, how can one who does not have knowledge equal to the omniscient, who is devoid of such knowledge, know the omniscient? They, being non-omniscient, cannot even know the means of knowing the omniscient. Therefore, due to the mutual dependence of the means and the object in knowing the omniscient, knowledge of the omniscient is not possible. For example, the omniscient can be known only if the means of knowing them is known, and the means of knowing the omniscient can be known only if one is omniscient oneself. Therefore, due to the mutual dependence of the knowledge of the means and the knowledge of the omniscient, it is completely impossible to know the omniscient through the means. Knowledge cannot fully explain the nature of the object of knowledge.

The object that is available and can be seen also has a middle part and a back part, but they are not visible because the middle part and the back part are obstructed by the front part, which is visible. Even if we imagine the middle part and the back part of the visible front part, and then imagine the parts adjacent to them, and so on, these imaginations will ultimately end at the atom, which is inherently very distant. Therefore, a non-omniscient person cannot know it. Without knowing it, the true knowledge of the object is also not available. Thus, due to the absence of an omniscient person, and due to the non-omniscient person's lack of knowledge of the true nature of the object, and due to the contradictory nature of the objects according to the principles of all knowers, and due to the increase in error with the increase in knowledge, ignorance is more beneficial. If an ignorant person hits someone on the head with their foot due to lack of knowledge, they are not considered to be as guilty because their mind is pure. Thus, the proponents of ignorance are incoherent and devoid of right knowledge. They are afflicted with mental confusion and doubt. Their objection that knowers are not correct because they present contradictory principles to each other is correct, because those who present contradictory principles believe in scriptures that are from non-omniscients, that are composed by non-omniscients. The contradictory principles they present do not invalidate all principles, because there is no contradiction in the statements of those who believe in the scriptures revealed by the omniscient, because omniscience cannot be established without it. The explanation is as follows: When the veil over knowledge is completely removed, there is no desire, aversion, or delusion, which is caused by false speech, and therefore the word of the omniscient is true. It cannot be called false. It is clear that those who have faith in the scriptures composed by the omniscient do not express contradictory meanings or intentions.

The skeptic raises a doubt, saying that if there is an omniscient, then this might be possible, but that is not the case, as has been said before. In response, they provide a solution, saying...

Page #526:
---------------------------
The Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra states: "What you are saying is not logical. Even if the existence of the omniscient is true, it cannot be known by the non-omniscient or the limited knower. Your statement is not logical. Although the thoughts of others cannot be known, men with attachment and passion are found to behave like those without attachment and passion, and vice versa. Therefore, the omniscient cannot be attained by direct evidence, but because of the possibility and inference evidence, and the absence of contradictory evidence, the existence of the omniscient cannot be ruled out. The possibility and inference are as follows: Through the study of grammar and other scriptures, the mind imbued with impressions sees knowable objects with great clarity. It is observed that a person who has studied grammar understands more than an ignorant person. Similarly, as a result of the practice of special meditation and other practices, a person with special knowledge can only be an omniscient person who knows all things. There is no contradictory evidence of omniscience, such as "there cannot be an omniscient," because a limited knower is not capable of proving the absence of omniscience by direct evidence, because his knowledge is limited. He is devoid of the knowledge and knowable knowledge of the omniscient. If he knows the knowledge and knowable of the omniscient by his own knowledge, then he himself becomes omniscient. Then where is the question of not being omniscient? Inference evidence also cannot contradict the omniscient. Because there is no invariable and faultless reason for the absence of the omniscient. The absence of the omniscient cannot be proved by analogy evidence, because the basis of analogy is similarity. The tendency of analogy is with the same, but there is no similarity with the absence of the omniscient. Therefore, as said before, the absence of the omniscient cannot be proved by analogy evidence. The absence of the omniscient cannot be proved by implication evidence either, because the tendency of implication is only from direct evidence, etc., which has been stated before. Implication is based on direct evidence, etc. Therefore, when the absence of the omniscient is not proved by direct evidence, etc., it cannot be proved by implication either. The absence or non-existence of the omniscient does not occur by scriptural evidence either, because scriptures state the existence or non-existence of the omniscient. If you say that the existence of the omniscient is not proved by the five evidences of direct knowledge, analogy, implication, and possibility, then it is decided that there is no omniscient. This is not true, because there is no evidence available that makes the omniscient known in all places and at all times. A limited knower is not entitled to say so, because a person who is very far away from the place and time cannot be known by a limited knower. If he is able to know them, then he himself becomes omniscient. Then how can it be said that there is no omniscient person? The knowledge of a person who sees gross objects does not reach the omniscient. The knowledge of a person who sees gross objects is not comprehensive. Therefore, the absence of the omniscient cannot be shown by him. If an object cannot reach the vicinity of another object due to its non-comprehensiveness, then the absence of that object cannot be said. If it is said that the omniscient is not known by the knowledge by which other objects are known, then it is proved that there is no omniscient. This is not true, because there is no rule that the omniscient should be known by the knowledge by which other objects are known. Therefore, no evidence is obtained that obstructs the existence of the omniscient, and there is evidence of possibility and inference that proves it. Therefore, the existence of the omniscient is proved. By accepting the scriptures formulated by the omniscient, no fault arises in the form of differences or different opinions. The scriptures formulated by the omniscient..."

The translation preserving the Jain terms is as follows:

All those who have faith in the study of the Shri Samavasharan (the divine assembly hall of the Tirthankara) unanimously accept that the soul (atma) is all-pervasive, not just the body, because the quality of consciousness (chaitanya) is present in the body itself. Earlier, the Ajnanavadi (the proponent of ignorance) discussed the fallacy of mutual dependence (itaretarashraya-anyonyashraya), but that is also not possible here because through the study of scriptures and the like, the intellect (buddhi) attains extraordinary and special knowledge. This is attained and known in one's own soul (atma). Therefore, there is no inconsistency or obstruction in what is directly perceived.

The Ajnanavadi who propound that knowledge is not capable of fully comprehending the nature of the knowable (jneya) because everywhere the posterior part of the substance (vastu) remains covered or obscured by the anterior part, and the ultimate part of the object is the atom (paramanu) which is imperceptible and cannot be grasped by the senses - this is merely a statement, because even the substances obscured by time, place, and nature are apprehended by the knowledge of the Omniscient (Sarvajna). Therefore, there is no possibility of obstruction in the knowledge of the Omniscient. Even the knowledge of an ordinary knowledgeable person operates in the whole through the part, in the integral through the component; therefore, there is no obstruction in it. The integral (avayavi) becomes obscured by its own parts (avayava); this is not logically sound. Ignorance (ajnana) alone is beneficial. In your statement, the term 'ajnana' either implies negation (paryudasa) of knowledge or absolute denial (prasajya-pratishedha) of knowledge. If you consider it as negation and call some other knowledge as 'ajnana', then you have accepted that other knowledge as the means of well-being, and thus the doctrine of Ajnanavada is not established. If you accept it as absolute denial, then the absence of knowledge is trivial and devoid of existence, bereft of all potency; how can it then be the means of well-being? If it is said that 'ajnana' is the means of well-being, and this statement is taken as absolute denial, then knowledge, which is the opposite of 'ajnana', is not the means of well-being - this would mean that the attainment of well-being is denied through knowledge, which is contrary to direct experience, because a person endowed with right knowledge (samyag-jnana), who has comprehended the true nature of the object, engages in the activity and accomplishes the task, which is directly observable. Therefore, knowledge cannot be called false or meaningless.

The Ajnanavadi, even if someone's head is accidentally touched by someone's foot due to ignorance or carelessness, considering it as a minor fault, still proclaim ignorance as beneficial. This is directly contradictory to the principle. Here, the validity of inference is not required, nor is it necessary. The Ajnanavadi are unskilled and incompetent in imparting religious instruction, yet they teach the same dharma to their equally unskilled and incompetent disciples. Here, the plural number has been used in a poetic manner instead of the singular. Even the Buddhists mostly fall under the category of Ajnanavadi, because they believe that the karma bound by the ignorant, the unwise, the unknowing, does not bind, and they claim that children, the intoxicated, and the sleeping person are devoid of clear knowledge, and therefore, their karma does not bind.

All these proponents should be understood as endowed with ignorance. They speak without deliberation and reflection, relying on ignorance; therefore, they are false speakers, because speech with knowledge involves contemplation and deliberation. This is in reference to the words 'kiriyam akkiriyam' (action and non-action) appearing in the third pada of the first verse.

Page #528:
---------------------------
The Sutra of the Sri Sutra Kritanga is based on contemplation. It depends on contemplation. They do not speak without contemplation because they reject knowledge. Because they do not speak without contemplation, they are false speakers, this is proven.

"They contemplate what is true and what is false, and they declare what is good and what is bad. Just as many people, when asked, have expressed their opinion." (3)

Commentary: "They contemplate what is true and what is false, and they declare what is good and what is bad. Just as many people, when asked, have expressed their opinion." (3)

Translation: The Vainyaikas (those who follow the path of humility) declare truth as falsehood and good as bad. When asked, they only advocate humility as the path to liberation.

Commentary: The author of the Sutra now proceeds to refute the Vainyaika doctrine. What is beneficial to all, what is auspicious for all, what is the true nature of reality, what is the true nature of things, what is liberation, what is restraint, that is truth. The Vainyaikas consider that truth to be falsehood, and falsehood to be truth. For example, the path to liberation, which is right faith and right conduct, is truth. The Vainyaikas consider it to be falsehood, and they believe that liberation is only through humility. They also consider the wicked, who do not perform specific virtuous actions, to be good simply because they perform acts of humility such as bowing down. They are not true examiners of dharma, because they believe that dharma arises only from humility, which is not logical. Who are these people? The author explains: "These people" are those who are known by their intellect, who are like ordinary people, who follow the path of humility, who believe that liberation and heaven are attained only through humility. There are thirty-two different types of them, and they are many. When a seeker of dharma asks them, or even without being asked, they express their opinion, their true nature, saying that liberation and heaven are attained only through humility. They are always humble, and they have accepted humility for the benefit of all. The word "name" indicates possibility, and it is possible that one's work is accomplished through humility. As it is said, "Therefore, humility is the receptacle of all good things." (3)

---------------------------
The text discusses the teachings of the Jain tradition, specifically focusing on the concept of "Vinaaya" (humility) and its role in achieving spiritual liberation. 

The text states that those who believe in the power of "Vinaaya" believe that it leads to the attainment of all good things. They argue that humility is the key to achieving liberation. 

The text then contrasts this view with that of the "Akriyaavadi" (non-actionists), who believe that actions have no real effect and that the present moment is not truly real. They argue that the past and future determine the present, making actions irrelevant. 

The text criticizes both the "Vinaayaavadi" and the "Akriyaavadi" for their limited understanding of reality. It argues that both groups are misled by their own biases and fail to grasp the true nature of things. 

The text then goes on to discuss the views of the "Lokayatika" (materialists) and the "Bauddha" (Buddhists), who are also considered "Akriyaavadi" in their belief that actions have no lasting effect. The text argues that these groups are ultimately nihilistic, denying the existence of a soul and the possibility of true liberation. 

The text concludes by emphasizing the importance of true knowledge and understanding in achieving spiritual liberation. It argues that only through a deep understanding of reality can one truly escape the cycle of birth and death.

---------------------------
The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra states: "It is appropriate to be a Yujamaana." Thus, the first half of the verse should be applied even to the Kriya-vadi view, according to the Kakaakshi-golaka-nyaya. ||4|| Now, to show the ignorance of the Kriya-vadis, the author says:

Commentary: Knowledge of a thing by its number is called Sankhya, and the correct knowledge of the true nature of a thing is called Upsankhya. Without it, that is, without the knowledge of the true nature of the object, the Vainayikas, who are confused and attached to their own views, preach only about attaining heaven and liberation through humility. They say, "By being humble to everyone, we will attain heaven and liberation." But their statement is devoid of any thought. Liberation is attained only through the harmony of knowledge and action. Abandoning this, they preach that only humility leads to heaven and liberation. Their statement here is that humility is the cause of all good. Humility is the cause of good only when there is right faith, right knowledge, etc. It is not the sole cause. One who is devoid of right faith, right knowledge, etc., even if he is humble, is deserving of contempt and rejection by all. The intended meaning is that heaven or liberation is not attained only through humility. Therefore, those who preach that only humility leads to heaven and liberation are Vinaya-vadis, who are covered in ignorance. They do not achieve their intended or desired meaning.

The Vinaya-vadis have been described. The Sutra-kara, in order to refute the views of the Akriya-vadis, says in the second half of the verse: "Love" is called Karma. Those who doubt it or are averse to it are called Lava-avashanki. The Lokayatikas and Buddhists, etc., fall into this category. According to their doctrines, there is no soul. Then where does its action originate, and how can Karma-bandha, which is generated by that action, occur? Therefore, according to their doctrines, there is no real bondage, but only an imputation. The same thing is expressed when it is said: "Just as it is said in the world, 'I have tied my fist, I have untied my fist,' it is not actually tied or untied by a rope, etc. It is only the folded hands that are tied and untied like a knot. In reality, nothing is tied or untied. This is an imputed practice. Similarly, one should understand the practice of being bound and liberated in the world." This is the doctrine of the Buddhists that all things are momentary, but action cannot occur in momentary things. Therefore, they are Akriya-vadis. Although the Buddhists do not accept the five skandhas, they believe that they are only imputations. They do not accept their real form. Their view is that no object is capable of expressing its own nature through knowledge, that is, the nature of objects cannot be known through knowledge. Because an object composed of parts does not occur or become known when considered by both the real and the unreal. Similarly, even the parts, when considered down to the atom, do not become the object of knowledge due to their extreme subtlety. Knowledge also does not take form due to the formlessness of the abstract, because of the absence of the knowable. It is said: "The more the objects are contemplated, the more their analysis increases." If it is pleasing to us to continue the analysis of objects, what can we do? Buddhists who believe in this kind of doctrine are secretly Lokayatikas, atheists. In the Buddhist view, the present moment does not coincide with the future moments and the past moments.

Page #531:
---------------------------
The study of the Samvasarana is not performed, therefore karma-bandha does not occur. Those who believe in akriya-vada are therefore atheists. They deny all substances and prohibit action due to the fear of karma-bandha. Those who believe in the Sankhya philosophy consider the soul to be all-pervasive. Therefore, they also do not accept action. They are akriya-vadis. Lokayatika, Buddhist, and Sankhya thinkers, without proper understanding, advocate this principle. They claim that the nature of substances is truly defined and manifested according to our principles. This is ignorant. Thus, the first part of this verse should be explained using the example of the eye-ball of a crow (kakaakshi golak nyaya) to illustrate the view of the akriya-vadis. Now, the sutra-kara, to explain the ignorant approach of the akriya-vadis, says:

"Sammisrabhavam cha gira ghahie, se mummui hoi anaanuwai. Iman dupakhan immegpakhan, ahansu chalaayanam cha kamma." ||5||

Commentary: "Sammisrabhavam cha gira grihite, sa mukamuko bhavati ananuvadi. Idam dvipakha midamekapakha mahu chalaayatanam cha kamma." ||5||

Translation: The aforementioned thinkers, by accepting substances through their words, deny them by accepting sammisrabhava - the existence and non-existence of substances. They are unable to respond to the words of those who believe in syadvada, becoming silent. They consider their own view as without opposition and the views of others as having opposition. They use deceitful language to refute the principles of syadvadis.

Commentary: By accepting their own words, they deny the meaning of those words. When the meaning is accepted, they deny it through their words. Thus, Lokayatika and others accept sammisrabhava - the existence and non-existence of substances. The word "va" indicates that they only accept existence in their denial. For example, Lokayatika, while teaching their disciples, would necessarily accept the existence of the soul, the doer, and the scriptures as the cause, and the disciples as the recipients of karma. If everything were void, then these three would not exist, and there would be no mixture or contradiction. Buddhists also accept sammisrabhava in the same way. For example:

"There is no traveler, nor are there six paths mentioned in the Buddhist scriptures. If there were a path to be traveled, how could the Buddhist teachings be considered beautiful?" ||1||

Similarly, "There is no karma, but there is fruit. There is fruit, but there is no self as the doer." How can there be six paths if there is no self as the doer? Since the stream of knowledge is relative and momentary, and action does not exist, there is no possibility of different paths. They present all actions as bonds, accepting their own view. Similarly, the five Jataka stories of the Buddha teach:

"Those who kill their mother and father, produce blood in the body of the Buddha, kill an Arhat, and break a stupa, these five..." ||1||

"...will go to Avici hell." If everything were void, then this teaching would be unreasonable. Similarly, there would be no birth, old age, death, disease, sorrow, or distinctions of high, medium, and low. This very karma-vipaka reveals the existence of the soul, its agency, and the existence of karma. Similarly,

Page #532:
---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

"Like the city of Gandharva, like a dream, like a cloud of illusions, like a mirage, like water in a desert, like the moon in the sky, like a wheel." (1)

From this statement, it is clear that the Buddhists accept the doctrine of mixed existence. Or, if they accept the doctrine of the effects of various actions, then their view is contradictory. As it is said:

"If your view of emptiness is a hindrance to my view, how can it be? Or, if you think it is not empty, then it is still my view." (1)

And so, the Buddhists, by the above-mentioned method, while trying to prove the non-existence of mixed existence, actually prove its existence.

Similarly, the Samkhyas, by accepting the existence of an inactive self that pervades everything, and by proving the existence of liberation through separation from nature, also prove the bondage and liberation of the self through their own words. Therefore, while accepting the existence of bondage and liberation, they accept the mixed existence of the self through their own words, because bondage and liberation cannot occur without action. Or, if inactivity is proved by words, then their own words contradict their view of inactivity.

Thus, the Lokayatikas, by accepting the doctrine of complete non-existence, prove the non-existence of action. The Buddhists, by accepting the doctrine of momentariness and complete emptiness, also accept the non-existence of action. They are motivated by their own scriptures and accept mixed existence through their own words. Similarly, the Samkhyas, by accepting the inactive self and the existence of bondage and liberation, accept mixed existence through their own view, and this contradiction has been explained.

Or, if a Buddhist or any other debater is confused by proper arguments and is able to give a proper answer, he becomes speechless, uttering only "Mummu-i hoi" (I am confused) in a stammering voice. Or, this meaning should be understood in a natural way, due to the silence of the person. Just as a mute person becomes mute even when speaking to another mute person, this shows that the debater is unable to refute the argument of the Syadvada. He is unable to refute the argument because he is unable to follow the argument, and he remains silent because his mind is confused by valid arguments. He does not speak and refutes the argument of the opponent without corrupting his own view. For example, he says, "This is one side of our view." This means that our view is one-sided, not two-sided, and it is not contradictory, because it is not opposed by any other view. And even though this is the case, he says, "This has two sides." This means that our view is two-sided, it is opposed by another view, and it is contradictory because it is opposed by another view. As it has been shown earlier, this is how their view is contradictory. Or, if this view has two sides, then it is two-sided because it accepts the destruction of the bondage of karma by relying on two opposing views. This reliance on two opposing views leads to suffering in this world and the next, like thieves, adulterers, and others. They experience the consequences of their actions in this world, such as the cutting of their hands, feet, noses, etc., which is like a flower, and they experience the consequences of their actions in the next world, such as hell, etc. Similarly, other actions are also accepted as being experienced in both worlds. This is like the previous example, "The being knows the being." This is one side of the view, because it is experienced in this life. This is like the example, "The unlearned, the learned, the wrong path, the dream-like."

Thus, those who are accused by the Syadvada prove their own view by the method mentioned above. They also mention the deception of the Syadvada, such as the deception of the six sense organs, the deception of the new blanket, Devadatta, etc. They say, "They say," and they mention other deceptions, such as the deception of action, one side, two sides, etc. Or, they say, "The six sense organs are the causes of attachment, the doors of inflow, the ear, the eye, etc. The karma that has these six sense organs is called karma." (5)

## Commentary

The words of other schools of thought, i.e., their accepted principles, prove the existence of objects. Or, their principles cannot be established without accepting the existence of objects. In such a situation, the object becomes self-evident. In such a situation, while denying the existence of the object through words, they accept the mixed existence of the Lokayatikas, the Charvakas, etc., i.e., they accept a view that is a mixture of both. The word "or" here should be understood as meaning that while denying the existence of the object, the Lokayatikas and the Charvakas actually prove its existence. This can be understood as follows:

The Charvakas teach their disciples about the non-existence of the soul, etc. Here, they must accept the existence of the teacher, the scripture that is the means of teaching, and the disciple who is being taught. Without accepting these, teaching is not possible.

Page #533:
---------------------------
The three principles of Samvasarana, Adhyayana, and the third one, do not occur. In the principle of Sarva Sunyata, or nihilism, these three principles are not present. Thus, they take refuge in the mixed view, or the mixed side, meaning they both assert that there is no substance and also accept its existence.

Despite denying the existence of substance, they acknowledge its reality. Buddhists also embrace this mixed view, adopting contradictory mixed sides. It is said that in a principle where there is no one who moves or goes, how can six types of motion be established? Movement is called motion. How can this statement, heard through the tradition of scriptures, be consistent with Buddhist doctrine? Karma does not exist, yet its results occur. How is this possible? If there is no soul to move, how can its six types of motion occur? The concept of Jins Jnana Sansthana, imagined by Buddhists, is also not different from knowledge; it is imposed. Each moment of knowledge, occurring in each moment, is momentary and perishes in the next moment. Therefore, it is not stable. Therefore, due to the non-existence of action, the existence of various types of motion is never consistent according to their doctrine. Buddhists declare all actions to be unbound and free from bondage in their scriptures. But they also assert that Buddha took birth five hundred times. They also say that by killing parents, extracting blood from Buddha's body, killing an Arhat, killing them, and destroying the Dharma Stupa, a person goes to the hell called Avichi. When there is no bondage of karma, and everything is void, then the creation of such scriptures becomes illogical. If there is no bondage from karma, then how can birth, old age, death, sickness, suffering, the best, the superior, the middle, and the inferior occur? How can karma have different types of results? This proves that the soul must exist, it is an agent, it performs actions. Karma also has its own existence. Despite this, they say that all worldly substances are false, like the vision of a mythical city in the sky, Gandharva Nagar. They are mere illusions, like Maya, dreams, clouds, mirages, dew, moonlight, and the circles of sparks from a fire. This makes it clear that Buddhists accept the mixed view, or they contradict their nihilism by accepting the diverse results of karma. Therefore, it is said that if your side is void, non-existent, then how can it refute or disprove my side? If you do not consider it void, then the side you accept is mine. Thus, Buddhists accept the mixed view in the aforementioned manner. They assert the non-existence of substances while narrating their existence, which is contrary to it.

Samkhya philosophers also consider the soul to be all-pervasive and accept it as inactive, and they accept its liberation from the separation of nature. Thus, they themselves accept the bondage and liberation of the soul through their own words. If the bondage and liberation of the soul occur in this way, then their own words give rise to the soul's activity and action. Thus, Samkhya philosophers also accept the mixed view because bondage and liberation do not occur without action. The word "va" here indicates that Samkhya philosophers, while proving the soul to be inactive, make it active and action-oriented through their own words.

Lokayata-Charvaka thinkers accept the absence or non-existence of all substances. Accordingly, they declare the absence of action. Buddhist thinkers accept the momentariness and voidness of all substances and declare action.

Page #534:
---------------------------
The authors of the Sutra Kritanga Sutra believe in non-existence, but when asked why and how they create the Agamas if all substances do not exist, they accept the mixed state through their speech. Similarly, the Sankhya philosophers, while considering the soul to be inactive, also advocate its bondage and liberation, thereby accepting it as active and capable of action. Thus, they resort to the mixed state.

It has been explained that all other philosophers who believe in the aforementioned inaction, while proving their own side, also prove the opposing action, which is not their side. When a Syadvadi, who believes in Syadvada or Anekantavada, refutes the doctrines of the Buddhists, etc., using proper reasons, examples, and illustrations, they are unable to give a proper answer. They start mumbling in an unclear way, as if their mind is wandering, or because of the use of Chandas in the style of Prakrit, one should understand its meaning. When asked the aforementioned questions by the Syadvadi, the Buddhists, etc., become speechless - they become mute - they become completely silent - they are stunned. The Sutrakar, while advocating this, says that the Syadvadi cannot translate the proper reasons, etc., presented - they cannot understand and answer. They become anxious and silent - they remain silent. When the Syadvadi presents reasons and examples against the Buddhists, etc., they start to adorn their own doctrine without translating them - without giving a counter-argument. They start saying that our philosophy is free from the opposing side. It is the only side. And because it is mutually non-contradictory and has the same meaning, it is free from obstacles - it is free from contradictions. Their statement is not true. This has been said before. (Jain philosophers say) Our philosophy is two-sided - it has two sides. It is with an opposing side. It is Anekantic - it is based on Anekantavada. The statement that expresses the contradictory meaning of the previous and the subsequent is called a contradictory statement. Such contradictory and non-contradictory statements have a place in it from a relative perspective, as has been said before. Or, in another way, our philosophy is two-sided. Our philosophy is two-sided from the perspective of karma-bondage and liberation. Just as a being receives the fruits of its karma, like a thief, a womanizer, etc., in this world and in the next world - in both worlds. The thief and the womanizer have their hands, feet, nose, etc., cut off, causing them suffering, which is like the effect of their karma, like a flower, and in the next world, they suffer hellish torments, which are like the fruit of their karma, like the fruit of their karma. Just as the fruits of these karmas have to be suffered in both worlds, similarly, other good deeds, bad deeds, and sins also have to be suffered in both worlds. Jain philosophy is two-sided because of this belief, but the Buddhists, etc., are one-sided. They say that the fruits of karma are received in this birth, not in another. As has been said before in the form of "Praani Praani Gyaanam". They say that Avgyopacit, Parigyopacit, E-path, Swapnantic, the bondage of karma is only a touch. The mere touch of bondage has no fruit in the next world - therefore, they are one-sided. When a man who believes in Syadvada starts pointing out flaws in their doctrine, they resort to the fully described policy-method, claiming their philosophy to be superior, and use deception in the proper reasons presented by the Syadvadi. For example, Devadatta's blanket is new. This sentence "Navakambalo Devadatta" is said with this meaning. The word "nava" is ambiguous - it denotes both new and nine. The word "nava" used here has the numerical meaning of nine.

Page #535:
---------------------------
##  The Study of Samvasarana

Someone prohibits it. It means the opposite of new. In the same way, Buddhist and other philosophers have used deception in the true reasons established by the Jains - in the real causes. The word 'ch' used here also indicates other unreasonable faults. Buddhists have accepted karma in their philosophy as one side and two sides, etc. Or they call karma as ṣaḍāyatana. The senses like hearing, etc., which are the material causes - the doors of inflow, are called ṣaḍāyatana. According to Buddhists, there is such a belief about karma as ṣaḍāyatana.

**Verse 6:**

They thus speak, not understanding, proponents of various false doctrines.
Taking them on, many people wander in the world, without any true understanding.

**Commentary:**

The author of the sutra says, "They" - the Cārvāka, Buddhists, etc., who are proponents of inaction, speak thus. They do not understand the true nature of things, their hearts are covered with the veil of falsehood. They present various kinds of scriptures, such as:

"By giving, one obtains great pleasures, and the heaven of the gods, by virtue. By meditation, one attains liberation, by austerity, all things are achieved."

And, "There are only four elements: earth, water, fire, and air. There is no other self, the experiencer of pleasure and pain. If these are also not real, then everything is like a dream, a magic show, a mirage, a double moon, etc."

And, "Everything is momentary and without self. Liberation is the realization of emptiness, the rest are just thoughts."

Thus, they present various kinds of scriptures, being proponents of inaction, who are themselves inactive. They, not understanding the true nature of things, take on their philosophy, and many people wander in the world, without any true understanding, like a rat in a cage. For example, there is no proof for the Lokāyata's claim that everything is void. As it is said:

"The truths are submerged, without reason, they cannot be established. If it exists, then it is not the truth, if it is established, then everything must be true."

Nor is perception the only proof, because the past and future are not directly perceived, and the validity of the relationship with the father is not established. Therefore, all social interaction would be destroyed. Also, the Buddhists' claim that everything is momentary leads to the absence of reality. For example, whatever is the cause of action is truly real. But a moment does not cause action gradually, because of its momentary nature. Nor does it cause action collectively, because all actions would occur in the same moment. This is not desirable, nor is it the basis of knowledge. Without a self, a knower, there is no possibility of the perception of a collection of qualities. This has been said before. And what is said, "By giving, one obtains great pleasures," etc., is also desirable in some way. But these are not accepted as objections.

Page #536:
---------------------------
The Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra, while explaining the principles of various scriptures, emphasizes the importance of giving, stating that it leads to great enjoyments. It also asserts that following ethical conduct leads to divine status, while contemplation leads to liberation, and austerity leads to the attainment of all virtues. 

The Sutra further states that earth, water, fire, and air are the four elements. There is no soul, a substance that experiences pleasure and pain, beyond these elements. These elements appear beautiful due to their lack of contemplation, their inherent nature remaining unexplored. However, in reality, they are not real, as they are mere appearances, like dreams, illusions, mirages, and double moons. All substances are transient, devoid of self, and without a soul. Liberation is attained through the perspective of emptiness. Other emotions are experienced to achieve this liberation. 

Thus, the Akriyavadis, who believe in the inactivity of the soul, explain their principles in various ways. They do not understand the true nature of things. Therefore, those who follow these principles keep revolving in the cycle of existence like a water wheel. 

The Lokayatika-Charvaka school believes in complete nihilism, but there is no proof for it. The Jainas argue that all substances are unreal, which can be proven through logic. However, if logic itself is unreal, how can the unreality of substances be proven? If you accept logic as true, then our belief is proven, because just as logic is true, so are all substances. 

The Charvaka school accepts only direct perception as evidence, but this is not logical. This is because the relationship between a father and his son in the past and the future cannot be understood by accepting only direct perception as evidence. The past and the future are not objects of direct perception. Accepting only direct perception as evidence would negate all worldly interactions. Therefore, other forms of evidence, such as inference, are also acceptable. 

Similarly, those who believe in Buddhism accept all substances as transient. However, if substances are transient, their existence cannot be proven. This is because substances are related to action and causation. The one who acts is truly real. If substances are transient, they cannot perform actions sequentially, as sequential action contradicts transience. If all actions are performed in a single moment, then all actions should be performed in that single moment. However, this is not observed, desired, or possible. 

The basis of all knowledge is a soul with qualities. Without this belief, knowledge like "I have known all five sense objects" cannot be attained, as it is a perception arising from the combination of perceptions. This has been explained earlier. 

The Buddhists say that "giving leads to the attainment of great enjoyments." This is partially accepted by the Arhat Jains. Therefore, this belief does not pose any obstacle for us.

"Neither does it rise nor set, nor does the moon wax or wane. Waters do not flow, nor do winds blow, the whole world is barren."

Page #537:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Samvāsaraṇā Study Translation -** Those who believe in nihilism say that the sun does not rise or set. The moon does not wax or wane. Water does not flow, wind does not blow, this entire world is barren, false, and non-existent.

**Commentary -** Again, the nihilistic view is expressed: "All nihilists are also inactive, and they deny all actions, even the rising and setting of the sun." This is because the sun is perceived by all as the light of the world, the divider of time into days, etc. But according to them, it does not exist. How then can it rise or set? And what is seen as a blazing ball of fire is merely an illusion, like a mirage or a double moon, for those who are deluded. Similarly, the moon does not wax in the bright fortnight, nor does it wane daily in the dark fortnight. Likewise, water does not "flow" from mountain springs. And the winds, which are constantly moving, do not blow. What more need be said? This entire world is "barren," devoid of meaning, "fixed," and non-existent. Everything that is perceived is like an illusion, a dream, or a magician's trick. ||7||

**Commentary Meaning -** The author of the sutras presents the principle of universal nihilism. Nihilists and inactive ones deny the actions of the sun's rising and setting, which are true and directly perceived. Everyone sees them, but they deny them. The author explains that the sun is directly perceived by everyone, everyone sees it. It is like a lamp for the world. It divides time into days, etc. But according to nihilists, it does not exist. Then what about its rising and setting? What is seen as a blazing ball of fire in the sky is an illusion for those who are deluded, like a double moon or a mirage. Deluded people believe this. The moon does not grow in the bright fortnight, nor does it decrease in the dark fortnight. Springs do not flow from mountains. The constantly moving wind does not blow either. What more can be said? This entire world is barren, meaningless, and definitively non-existent. Whatever is available in this world is false, like an illusion, a dream, or a magician's trick.

**Just as the blind, even with a lamp, do not see forms, so too those with obstructed wisdom, even though actions exist, do not see them. ||8||**

**Shadow -** Just as a blind man, even with a lamp, does not see forms, because he has poor eyesight.

**Translation -** Just as a blind man, even with a lamp, cannot see objects because he has poor eyesight, so too those who are inactive, whose wisdom is obstructed, cannot see actions even though they exist.

**Commentary -** To refute this, the author says: "Just as a blind man, born blind or later blinded, with poor eyesight, does not see objects like pots and pans, even when they are present with a lamp, so too those who are inactive do not see objects like pots and pans, or actions like existence, movement, etc. Why? Because their wisdom is obstructed by a veil of ignorance. Those whose wisdom is thus obstructed are like those who cannot see a lamp, a woman, or a cow, even though they are present.

Page #538:
---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states: The rising of the sun, which is observed daily, is marked by the opening of lotuses and the beginning of the day. This action is also inferred from the movement of Devadatta and others from one place to another. Similarly, the moon, which wanes daily, reaches its complete depletion and then grows again with its phases, until it reaches its full state, which is observed by everyone. Likewise, rivers flow with waves of water during the rainy season. The wind is inferred from the breaking of trees, tremors, and other phenomena. 

You say that all this is like illusion, a dream, or magic. This is not true, because if everything were non-existent, then there would be no truth to any illusory form, and thus illusion itself would be non-existent. And who would be the one to establish illusion, and what would be established if everything were void? 

Similarly, dreams are established in the state of wakefulness, which is true. If wakefulness were non-existent, then dreams would also be non-existent. Therefore, by accepting dreams, you must also accept the state of wakefulness, which follows them. By accepting this, the concept of universal voidness is negated. Dreams are not simply non-existent, because they are experienced and have real effects. As it is said:

"**Anuhuyadiṭṭhacintiya chāyapayaiviyāradevayā'ṇūyā. Sumina'ssa nimittā'ī puṇṇaṁ pāvaṁ ca ṇābhāvo. ||1||**" (Shadow - experienced, seen, thought, heard, nature, change, divine forms. The causes of dreams are merit and demerit, not non-existence. ||1||)

Magic, too, is established in the presence of truth. If it were non-existent, then who would establish magic for whom? The appearance of two moons in the night also occurs when there is a single moon, which is perceived as real. This is not possible if everything were void. Nor is there any absolute non-existence of anything. The non-existence of things like the horns of a rabbit, the hair of a tortoise, the lotus in the sky, etc., is well-known. This refers to the non-existence of the meaning of the whole, not the meaning of each individual word. For example, the rabbit exists, and the horn exists, but it is stated that the horn that is connected to the head of the rabbit does not exist. Thus, only the connection is negated, not the absolute non-existence of the object. This should be understood in other contexts as well.

Those who are ignorant of the truth, the **Tirthikas**, cling to the doctrine of inaction, even though action exists. 

Those who are wise, however, understand the truth as it is. For example, those who have attained **Kevala Jnana**, the perfect knowledge, see all objects in the three worlds as clearly as a fruit in the palm of their hand. Those who have complete knowledge of the scriptures understand past and future events through the scriptures. Others, who are skilled in the eightfold means of knowing, understand the nature of the soul and other objects through the power of these means. As it is said:

**Commentary:** To refute the doctrine of universal voidness, the Sutrakar states: Just as a blind person from birth, or one who became blind after birth, cannot see objects like pots, cloths, etc., even when they are in the presence of light from a lamp, etc., similarly, those who believe in inaction cannot see the existence of pots, cloths, etc., and the actions of moving, shaking, etc. Why can't they see these things? Because their knowledge is covered by karmas like **Jnana Avaraniya**, etc. 

The rising of the sun is known to everyone, from cowherds to women. The sun destroys all darkness and opens lotuses. It is observed rising every day, just as Devadatta and others move from one place to another. Similarly, the sun also moves from one place to another.

## The Study of Samvasarana

How can the state of Maya persist when both the study of Samvasarana and the object to which Maya is attributed are absent? Just as a dream occurs only when the state of wakefulness exists, so too, accepting the dream necessitates accepting the state of wakefulness.  Accepting or proving the state of wakefulness leads to the loss of all-emptiness - all-emptiness cannot persist.  A dream is not non-existent because the objects experienced and seen in a dream have existence in the world. Therefore, it is said that experienced, seen, thought, and heard nature-modifications, divine influence, merit, and demerit are the causes of a dream. However, non-existence is not the cause of a dream.  The arrangement of magic is also done only when another object is true - it is merely an artificial form of truth. But when there is no true object in the world, who will create magic for whom? The illusion of two moons is also possible only when the night is true and when the one moon that creates the illusion is true. This cannot happen in a state of all-emptiness.  There is no absence of the extremely subtle form of any object.  The absence of the extremely subtle form is expressed in terms like "hare's horn," "tortoise hair," and "lotus in the sky," which are famous as examples of the absence of the meaning of the combined words, not the absence of the meaning of each word in the compound.  Because a hare exists in this world and horns also exist, the negation here is of the horn existing on the hare's head through the relation of inherence.  Thus, only the relation is negated here.  There is no absence of the object itself.  It should be understood in the same way elsewhere.  Even when actions like "exists" etc. are present, those who are devoid of wisdom and follow other doctrines resort to and believe in the doctrine of inaction.

Those whose wisdom is unhindered, not covered by karma like knowledge-obscuring karma, know the true nature of an object as it is.  Just as the clairvoyant, the mind-penetrator, and the omniscient see the objects existing in the three worlds like a myrobalan fruit held in the palm of the hand, so too, the fully scriptural knower knows the meaning and objects related to the past and future with the help of the scriptures.  The eight-fold cause-knower, other men, also understand, recognize, and know the living beings and other objects through the medium of causes.

"Many people in the world know the future by studying the eight-fold scriptures, which include astrology, dream interpretation, omens, bodily signs, causes, meteors, and celestial fires."

**Commentary:**

"Samvatsara" refers to astrology, "dream" refers to the book on dream interpretation, "omens" refer to things like the Srivatsa mark, "causes" refer to auspicious words, good omens, etc., "bodily signs" refer to those found on the body, like moles and birthmarks, "meteors" refer to celestial events like meteors, celestial fires, eclipses, earthquakes, and tremors, and "eight-fold" refers to the study of all these causes.  For example, the earth, meteors, dreams, the sky, and limbs are all causes.

Page #540:
---------------------------
- The Sri Sutra Kritanga Sutra, which describes the characteristics of sounds, consonants, and other elements, is derived from the third chapter of the ninth section of the Acharavastu. It reveals the causes and effects of happiness, suffering, life, death, gain, loss, and other things. By studying this, people in this world can understand past and future events. This is not possible in the theories of nihilism and others. Therefore, what they say is not based on evidence. ||9||
Commentary - Astrology is called "Samvatsar". The interpretation of events seen in dreams is called "Swapna" or "Swapnashashtra". Special signs like Srivatsa etc. are called "Lakshana". It is of two types - external and internal. The interpretation of the sounds of speech, birds, auspicious omens, and the presence of insects, flies, and moles in the body is called "Nimitta Shastra". The study of the science of omens like meteor showers, fire in the sky, thunder, earthquakes, and the eight-limbed Nimitta Shastra helps people understand future events. The eight limbs of Nimitta Shastra are: 1. Bhoum, 2. Utpat, 3. Swapna, 4. Antariksh, 5. Ang, 6. Swar, 7. Lakshana, 8. Vyanjan. The study of the Nimitta Shastra, which is derived from the third chapter of the ninth section of the fourteenth "Purva", reveals the causes and effects of happiness, suffering, life, death, gain, loss, etc. By studying this, people in this world can understand past and future events. However, this is not possible if one accepts nihilism. Therefore, what the Lokayatikas and others say is not based on evidence.
Some omens are true, but some people's knowledge about them is wrong. Those who do not understand the knowledge of omens say that it is better to abandon it. ||10||
Commentary - As explained above, it is said that even the scriptures are sometimes found to be contradictory. For example, the scriptures mention that even the six-fold path is subject to the fourteen "Purva". What then about those who know the eight-limbed Nimitta Shastra? The scriptures mention that the Nimitta Shastra without the limbs has thirteen and a half thousand sutras, and the commentary on it is as many lakhs. The limbs have thirteen and a half thousand sutras, and the commentary on them is countless, and the commentaries are countless. Thus, even those who know the eight-limbed Nimitta Shastra are subject to the six-fold path. This is what is said here - "Kei" etc. Due to the use of the Chandas style or the Prakrit style, there is a change in the meaning. Some omens are true, but some omens or those who know omens have a distorted understanding due to their mental deficiency, and therefore their knowledge of omens is wrong. Even the Arhats are subject to the contradiction of omens. What then about the Tirthikas? Thus, seeing the contradiction in the Nimitta Shastra, those who do not believe in action, "Vidya Sadbhavam", do not study the knowledge of omens, and believing that omens can be both true and false, they say, "Ahansu Vijapalimokkhameva", that is, they say that it is better to abandon the knowledge of omens due to its contradiction. Or, they say that liberation, which is the cessation of all actions, is achieved through knowledge alone, due to the absence of action. In some places, the last chapter says this...

Page #541:
---------------------------
The text of the Samvāsaraṇā study says, "Know that people are slow." Those who are ignorant say, "We know the world and its affairs by ourselves, without studying the scriptures. We are slow." But this is not true. The fact that a cause is real is evident from the fact that the effect is seen even when someone sneezes. Therefore, the statement of those who say that the cause is not real is false. This is not true, for there is no contradiction in the meaning of the scriptures that have been properly studied. Even though it is said that the six places of falling are present, this is not a reason to doubt the validity of the right knowledge, because it is dependent on the person and the destruction and cessation of the karmas. For example, if a mirage is mistaken for water, does that mean that the perception of water is also false? Similarly, if a person who is carrying a lamp is mistaken for fire, does that mean that the smoke is also false? A well-examined effect does not contradict its cause. Therefore, the fault lies with the knower, not with the knowledge. Similarly, a well-examined cause, as described in the scriptures, does not contradict the effect. The doubt that arises from the fact that the effect is seen even when someone sneezes is unfounded. For the success of the action that is seen even when someone sneezes is due to the power of other auspicious causes that are present in the interval. Even when an auspicious cause is present, the action may be hindered by the power of other causes. The scriptures say that the Buddha once told his disciples, "There will be a famine for twelve years. Therefore, go to other countries." They went according to his words, but were then forbidden by him, saying, "Do not go. A virtuous great being has been born here today. Due to his influence, there will be plenty." Thus, the doubt about the contradiction arises because of the presence of other causes. ॥१०॥

Commentary: This is how the opponent argues in support of the theory of action. He says that scriptural knowledge is contradictory and faulty because even the great men who know the fourteen previous existences fall into the six places of falling. This is stated in the scriptures. What to speak of those who know the eight-fold causes? The science of causes, which is separate from the angas, is limited to twelve hundred and fifty anustup verses. There are twelve thousand five hundred verses of commentary on these verses. There are twelve thousand five hundred verses of definition on that. There are twelve thousand five hundred sutras of the angas, and there are twelve lakh five hundred thousand verses of commentary on them. There are unlimited commentaries on that. Thus, the knowledge of those who know the eight-fold causes is also faulty because they fall into the six places of falling. It is said that many causes are true, and due to the weakness of the intellect of those who know the causes, and the absence of that kind of destruction and cessation of karmas, there is a contradiction in their knowledge of causes, and a contradiction is seen in their statements. The words "kei" etc. are used in the masculine gender instead of the neuter gender because they are in the Chandas style. The knowledge of the Jain scholars about the causes is also contradictory. It is not surprising that the knowledge of the other schools of thought about the causes is also contradictory. Thus, by showing that the knowledge of the science of causes is contradictory, the non-actionists advise against studying the scriptures and accepting the mixed scriptures as both true and false, or they say that by abandoning the knowledge of the scriptures, one can be freed from all karmas and attain liberation by mere knowledge, without any action. In some places, the fourth line of this verse is found as "Jaṇāsu logaṃsi vayaṃti manda." This means that the non-actionists believe that we know the world and its affairs by ourselves, without studying the scriptures. They are ignorant. They do not consider the science of causes to be true. They say that even if someone sneezes while walking, the success of his action is seen, and there is a man who is going with an auspicious omen, but his success is uncertain. Therefore, the astrologers who predict the future based on the causes are false.

Page #542:
---------------------------
This is their false speech, untrue speech. On this, the Jain philosophers say that this is not the reality. If one has studied the scriptures properly, then there is no contradiction in their statement. The six places where degeneration is mentioned are based on the intensity of the human being's decay and growth. It is not appropriate to suspect a defect in the correct evidence due to a defect in the apparent evidence. The perception of water in a mirage in the desert is a defect of perception. There is no water there, but on this basis, it is not reasonable to call the actual perception of water where it is, as false or deceptive. If smoke is filled in a mosquito and taken somewhere and its mouth is opened, then the smoke coming out of it cannot prove fire in it. Seeing this, it cannot be said that the smoke coming out of the fire where it is, is incapable of proving the fire. In this way, there is never any defect in the work done after proper deliberation. Therefore, if something is not proved due to the fault or ignorance of the person who proves it, then it is not appropriate to attribute the defect to the evidence. Similarly, there is no defect of deception in the science of cause and effect, which is established after careful consideration and proper reasoning. Those who doubt the science of cause and effect by saying that the work of a person who sneezes while going is proved, are unreasonable. Because it is seen that the work of a man who goes while sneezing in a hurry is accomplished due to the good causes that have arisen in the meantime. This should be understood. It should be known that the work of a man who sets out with a good omen is seen to be unsuccessful due to other inauspicious omens that come in between. It is heard that Buddha called his disciples and said that there will be a twelve-year famine here, so you people go to another country. When they were about to go, hearing his words, Buddha stopped them and said, "You people don't go. A virtuous great being has been born here today. Therefore, due to his influence, there will be prosperity. This shows that the other omen that came in between, the auspicious omen, produces an effect opposite to the previous omen.
Thus, the people who have come together, the monks and the Brahmins, say so. They say that suffering is self-inflicted, not inflicted by others. They say that liberation is attained through knowledge and action.
Commentary: Now, refuting the view of those who advocate action, he reveals their view, saying, "They who desire liberation, which is characterized by initiation, etc., independent of knowledge, say so, such as, 'There is a mother and father, there is a fruit of good deeds.' What is done?
(514)

Page #543:
---------------------------
They say that all is accomplished by action. With the idea that "all is accomplished by action," they declare that all exists, having known the "world" as consisting of the stationary and the mobile, and assuming that we are knowers of the existing things as they are. How do they say that it is not in any way non-existent? "Thus, thus," in that way, as action is, so is the fruit, such as heaven, hell, etc. And those ascetics, Tirthankaras, Brahmanas, etc., desire accomplishment by action. But whatever suffering and happiness there is in the world, all that is done by the self alone, not by another, such as time, Lord, etc. And this does not hold true in the theory of inaction, for there, due to inaction of the self, happiness and suffering would be uncreated, and thus there would be no coming and going of the created and the destroyed. Here it is said, "It is true that there is happiness, suffering, etc., of the self, but it is not so." For if it is said that it is so, then it follows that it is not in any way non-existent. And if that is the case, then everything would become all-pervading, and thus there would be an end to the conduct of all the world. And there is no accomplishment of action without knowledge, due to the absence of knowledge of the means. And without the means, the object is not attained. It is understood that all actions are fruitful only when they are done with knowledge. And it is said:

"First is knowledge, then compassion, thus stands the well-controlled. What will the ignorant do, or know, the cutting of evil?"

Therefore, the importance of knowledge is not denied. And accomplishment is not possible without knowledge, for knowledge without action is like a cripple, unable to accomplish anything. Considering this, it is said, "They said, 'Knowledge and conduct are the liberation.'" There is no accomplishment of action without knowledge, like a blind man, nor is there accomplishment of knowledge without action, like a cripple. Understanding this, they said, "They said, the Tirthankara-group, the Dharas, etc., what did they say? Liberation. How? Knowledge and conduct, these two are the causes, for whom? Having understood this, they said, 'This knowledge and conduct is liberation, accomplished by knowledge and action.' They declare this liberation, thus accomplished. If it is otherwise, then what are these Samvaranas declared by the Patanikas? And what is said, and what will be said, with this doubt, it is said, "They are thus, with unhindered..." Those who have unhindered, never-faltering, knowledge, the Tirthankaras, they are of unhindered knowledge. They thus, by the process described, declare, "The world," consisting of fourteen realms, or the stationary and the mobile, "having known," by the knowledge of the self, like the dust on the palm of the hand, the Tathagatas, "not having attained the Tirthankarahood, the perfect knowledge," the ascetics, "the virtuous, the Brahmanas," the restrained and the unrestrained, what is the nature of the Koka-speech, the words? They thus declare. Or, there is a reading, "Thus, thus," as the path of meditation is established, so they declare. And they also declare, "As whatever suffering there is in the world, which is not of the nature of arising, that which is opposite to it, happiness, which is of the nature of arising, that is done by the self alone, not by another, such as time, Lord, etc." And it is said:

"All experience the fruit, the result, of their past actions. In faults and virtues, the other is only the cause."

And they, the Tirthankara-group, the Dharas, etc., say, "Knowledge, conduct, action, these are the main things, liberation. They said, not independent of each other, knowledge and action." And it is said:

"Action without knowledge is fruitless, knowledge without action is wealth without understanding. Rejecting the mass of afflictions for the sake of peace, you have written down this path, which is auspicious."

The author of the sutras reveals the fault of the theory of the actionists, in order to refute them. (Those who accept that liberation is attained only by action, such as renunciation, etc., without knowledge. Their declaration is that there are parents, and there is also the fruit of good action, which is well performed. What do they want to say by this? Raising this question, the author of the sutras states. All actions are accomplished by action.

Page #544:
---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states that by knowing the stationary and mobile realms, the categories of beings within them, and the groups of substances, according to their own principles, we know the true nature of things. They declare that all things exist and all substances are harmonious, but they do not say that substances are in any way dependent. They say that a being experiences the fruits of its actions, such as heaven and hell, in accordance with its actions. The **Shramanas**, **Atyarthikas**, and **Brahmanas** believe that only action leads to liberation. They explain that all suffering and happiness in this world are self-created, not caused by time or by God. These things do not occur in the doctrines of those who do not believe in the theory of action, because without action, it is impossible to experience happiness, suffering, etc. If happiness and suffering could be experienced without action, then the destruction of what is done (**Kritanashakya**) and the arrival of what is not done (**Akritabhyagama**) would both be faults. In this context, the **Jains** state that what you say is true. The soul, happiness, suffering, etc., certainly exist, but they are not entirely independent. If their existence is stated in a definitive way, then it cannot be said that they are in any way dependent, because if that were not the case, everything would become all-encompassing, and all activity in the world would cease. Knowledge without action does not achieve anything, because there is no knowledge of the means to achieve that action, and without knowledge of the means, the desired object cannot be obtained. This is universally known. All action is fruitful only when it is guided by knowledge. Therefore, it is said that knowledge comes first, followed by compassion and its practice. Therefore, all **Samyami** (self-controlled) persons first acquire knowledge about beings, because an ignorant person, who does not have knowledge of the soul and other principles, what will he do? How will he progress correctly in the field of karma? How will he know what is good and what is bad? Therefore, knowledge is also paramount. But liberation cannot be achieved by knowledge alone, because knowledge without action, without karma, is like a cripple. The **Sutrakaras** (authors of the Sutras) have declared that the **Tirthankaras**, **Ganadharas**, etc., have said this in this regard. They ask, "Who is liberated? How is liberation attained? What is said about it?" In answering these questions, they say that liberation is attained by one who possesses both knowledge and action. Here, the word "**Jnana**" (knowledge) and "**Kriya**" (action) are used together, and the suffix "**acha**" is added according to the rule "**Arsha Adityanmatvarthayo'cha**". According to this, liberation is achieved through knowledge and action. The meaning is that the **Tirthankaras** and **Ganadharas**, etc., declare that liberation is attained through knowledge and action. This verse can also be interpreted in another way. It is asked, "Who has established these **Samavasaranas** (assemblies) that you have mentioned before and will mention later?" Doubting this, the **Sutrakaras** say that **Prajna** (wisdom) is the name of knowledge, which is the means of knowing the nature of things. Those whose wisdom is never obstructed or faltered are called **Aniruddha Prajna** (unobstructed wisdom), and they are the **Tirthankaras**. They declare the nature of things as explained earlier. They are liberated by knowledge alone, just as they know the fourteen **Rajjus** (ropes) and the finite stationary and mobile realms, like a myrobalan fruit held in the hand. The **Shramanas**, **Sadhus** (holy men), **Samyatis** (self-controlled), and **Brahmanas** narrate this through their righteous and logical speech. They explain how they are. Sometimes, the reading "**Tatha Tayeti Va**" is found. This means that...

Page #545:
---------------------------
The Tirthankaras expound the path of Samavasarana study in the same way that the path of Samadhi and the path of liberation are organized. They state that the suffering experienced by beings in the world as a result of the arising of Asatavedaniya (non-perceivable) and the happiness experienced as a result of the arising of Satavedaniya (perceivable) is done by the soul itself. It is not done by time, God, or any other entity. It is said that all beings experience the results (vipaka) of their past actions. In offenses, evil deeds, or wickedness, and in virtues, good deeds, or goodness, another is merely an instrument. The Tirthankaras and Ganadharas say that liberation is achieved through both knowledge and conduct. Liberation cannot be attained through action without knowledge or knowledge without action. It is said, "O Lord! You have shown the world the path of welfare by eliminating the useless action without knowledge and the wealth of knowledge without action, which are destructive to the peace of the group of afflictions, and by declaring them useless."

Those who are the eyes of this world, they are the leaders, they teach the path of benefit for the people. Thus, thus, they say in this world, "O people! You are deeply entangled." (12)

Commentary: "Those" - the Tirthankaras, Ganadharas, etc., who are extremely knowledgeable, are like eyes in this world. Just as the eyes perceive objects that are situated in a suitable place, so too do they cause the perception of objects in the world as they are. Thus, they are leaders in this world - the main ones. The word "tu" is a qualifier, meaning "leaders" because of their giving good advice. This is what is meant by "path" - knowledge, etc., the path of liberation, "teach" - they say, "people" - beings, for whom? "Benefit" - that which leads to good fortune and prevents harm. And - in the world that is made up of fourteen realms, or in the world that is made up of five categories of existence, whatever is eternal in the sense of the existence of substance and the intention of the path, "thus they say" - they have said. Or, this world, this group of beings, which is within the cycle of existence, is eternal as it is, thus they say. For example, as the growth of false views increases, so too does the world become eternal. For, in that case, all the Tirthankaras and their followers are likely to be bound by karma. And, also, because of the four stages, beginning with the great effort, the souls do not cease from the cycle of existence until they have exhausted their hellish lifespan. Or, they say that as the growth of attachment and aversion increases, so too does the cycle of existence become eternal. They say that as the amount of karma increases, so too does the cycle of existence increase. The increase in the cycle of existence is to be understood as the increase in evil mind, speech, and body. Thus, the cycle of existence increases. "In which" - in the cycle of existence, "beings" - creatures, "O people!" - since humans are primarily worthy of instruction, the word "human" is used. "Deeply entangled" - firmly established in the distinctions of right, hell, animal, and god. (12)

By showing the difference between beings in a small way, he explains the purpose of that pilgrimage.

Commentary: Those who are extremely knowledgeable - those who possess special knowledge - the Tirthankaras, Ganadharas, etc., are like eyes in this world. Just as the eyes illuminate an object that is situated in a suitable place, so too do they illuminate the world.

---------------------------
The _Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra_ reveals the true nature of things. They are the heroes, the leaders, the best in this world. The word "tu" here is used in the sense of an adjective. According to it, they are the best because they give good advice - this is the meaning. They show beings the path to liberation. What is that path? They explain that it leads to good fortune, to the highest state, and prevents misfortune, prevents bad rebirth. They narrate, according to the Dravyastikaya Nay, the eternal nature of things in this world, which is limited by the fourteen ropes and has five Astikayas. Or, they also explain how beings in this world are eternally bound to the cycle of rebirth. According to them, as false views increase, the cycle of rebirth becomes more stable, because the Tirthankaras and the Aharakas, who are free from karma, are all possible in it. Because the beings, through the four places of Mahaarambha, etc., bind themselves to the hellish lifespan. Until then, the cycle of rebirth does not end. Or, as attachment and aversion increase, the cycle of rebirth becomes more stable. This is how the Tirthankaras have described it. Therefore, as karma accumulates, binds, or increases, the cycle of rebirth also increases. It should be understood that the cycle of rebirth increases when the mind, speech, and body become corrupt, when they engage in evil actions. Those who are born in the cycle of rebirth are called "praja". All animals or beings are included in "praja". They are especially found in the four states of hell, animal, human, and god. Among them, humans are mostly worthy of instruction. Therefore, it is said here, addressing humans, that you should know this. The Sutrakar, briefly explaining the different types of beings, explains how they wander in the cycle of rebirth.
Those who are Rakshasas, or those who are Yamaloka, or those who are Suragandhavas, or those who are Kaya, or those who are Akashagami, or those who are Prithivyashrita, all of them wander again and again in different states.
Commentary: "Ye" are some of the Rakshasa beings of the Vyantara category. Because of the non-grasping of that, all the Vyantaras are included here. And those who are Yamaloka beings, like Amba, Ambarisha, etc., because of their characteristic, all the Bhavanapatis are included here. And those who are "Sura", like Saudharma, etc., who are Vaimanika, because of the "cha" word, the Jyotishkas, like Surya, etc., are included here. And those who are "Gandharva", like the Vidyadharas, who are a special type of Vyantara, because of the grasping of that, the importance is explained. And "Kaya", like the Prithvi Kaya, etc., all six are included here. Again, wanting to grasp the beings in another way, he says: "Ye" are some who are "Akashagami", who have attained the ability to fly in the sky, and those who have not attained it, the four types of Devas, the Vidyadharas, the birds, and the animals. And those who are "Prithivyashrita", who are the earth, fire, plants, and the two, three, four, and five-sense beings, all of them, because of their own actions, wander again and again in different ways, in many ways, in a roundabout way, in a way that is like a wheel, in a way that is close to each other, they go, they wander.
Commentary: Here, the Rakshasas, who are included in the Vyantara category, are grasped. Because of this, all the Vyantaras are included here. Amba, Ambarisha, etc., are the beings who live in the Yamaloka. Because of their characteristic, all the Bhavanapatis are included here.

The study of the Samvasarana is being undertaken here. The term "Sur" refers to the Vaimanika Devas like Saudharma, etc. The term "Ch" refers to the celestial Devas like the Sun, etc. The term "Gandharva" refers to the Vidyadharas or a specific Vyantara. The term "Kaya" refers to the six Kayas like the Prithvi Kaya, etc.

The Sutrakar further divides the beings into different categories, saying that those who are aerial, who have the ability to fly in the sky, are of four types: Devas, Vidyadharas, birds, and wind. Those who are earth-bound, including terrestrial, aquatic, fiery, vegetal, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed beings, all wander in various forms according to their actions, like the spokes of a wheel in the world.

"Oh, I know the boundless ocean of existence, the difficult liberation. Those who are attached to sensual pleasures wander in the world, again and again." (14)

Commentary: The Tirthankara Devas have described this world as boundless, like the ocean of the self-existent Raman. Therefore, consider this deep world as difficult to escape from. Beings who are attached to worldly pleasures and women wander in this world, again and again, in the forms of stationary and mobile beings.

Commentary: Further, the Tirthankara Ganadharas and others who know this, have said, "This is the ocean of existence." How do they say this? It is boundless, like the ocean of the self-existent Raman. Just as the ocean of the self-existent Raman cannot be crossed by any aquatic or terrestrial being, similarly, this ocean of existence cannot be crossed without right faith. Understand this. This ocean of existence, with its eighty-four lakhs of births, is endless and full of suffering. It is difficult to escape from, even for the non-believers, let alone the atheists. Further, the Sutrakar explains the world, which is symbolized by the ocean of existence. In this world, those who perform sinful actions, who are fallen from the right path, who do not understand the true Samvasarana, are attached to worldly pleasures and women. They are controlled by these pleasures and women, and they are always engaged in sinful activities. They are attached to this mire of worldly pleasures and women, and they wander in the sky and on the earth, or in the forms of stationary and mobile beings. They wander in the world, driven by their actions, which are based on the fourteen types of karma. (14)

Commentary: The Tirthankara Ganadharas and others who know the nature of the world have explained the nature of the ocean of existence. What is its nature? Answering this question, they say that this world is boundless, like the ocean of the self-existent Raman. Just as the ocean of the self-existent Raman cannot be crossed by any aquatic or terrestrial being, similarly, this ocean of existence cannot be crossed without right faith. Understand this. Here, the word "Nam" is a figure of speech. This ocean of existence, with its eighty-four lakhs of births, is endless and full of suffering. It is difficult to escape from, even for the non-believers, let alone the atheists. Further, the Sutrakar explains the world, which is symbolized by the ocean of existence. In this world, those who perform sinful actions, who are fallen from the right path, who do not understand the true Samvasarana, are attached to worldly pleasures and women. They are controlled by these pleasures and women, and they are always engaged in sinful activities. They are attached to this mire of worldly pleasures and women, and they wander in the sky and on the earth, or in the forms of stationary and mobile beings. They wander in the world, driven by their actions, which are based on the fourteen types of karma. (14)

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra
is used for the arrangement of this. This Bhava-gahana-samsara (profound worldly existence) is like a forest of eighty-four lakh (8.4 million) yonis (life-forms). And here, as far as possible, there are innumerable, countless, and infinite temporal states. This can be crossed with great difficulty even by the faithful souls in the Astika (theistic) religion. Then, what to say of the Nastika (atheistic) ones? The Sutrakara (author of the Sutra), while further revealing the speciality of this Bhavayuta (existence-bound) Samsara (worldly existence), say that those who perform Savadya (sinful) and Papayukta (sin-filled) Karmas (actions) in this Samsara have fallen into the despicable path. They have embraced Asat (false) doctrines. They are subjugated by Bhoga-pradhana (sensual pleasure-oriented) Anganas (women). Or, being under the sway of worldly pleasures, they never observe the practice of Sat (truth) and Uttama-acharan (supreme conduct). Immersed in the mire of worldly pleasures and the Angana (woman) form, they wander and take birth repeatedly in the Deva-loka (celestial realms), Manushya-loka (human realm), Naraka-loka (hell realms), or Sthavara-jangama (stationary and mobile) realms. Or, merely by the garb of Pravrajya (renunciation) and not observing the Virata-vrata (vow of detachment), and due to Raga-dvesa (attachment and aversion), they keep wandering in this Chaturdasha-rajju (fourteen-yojana) limited world due to the result of their own Karmas.

The verse states that the foolish ones do not destroy their Karmas through Karmas, while the wise destroy their Karmas through non-action. The intelligent ones, who have transcended greed, are content and do not commit sin.

Page #549:
---------------------------
The study of the Samavasarana. The cause is that they are bound by the karmas of the careful. Due to the beginning of the wrong conduct, they cannot destroy their sins. Due to ignorance, they are like children. The sutrakara expounds to show how the karmas are destroyed. By the destruction of the inflow through non-action, they finally attain the state of the Shaileshi. Just as the great physicians, like Dhira, Mahasattva, and Mahapurusha, destroy diseases by their treatment, they destroy the karmas in the same way. Those who have intelligence, wisdom, or intellect are called intelligent. They know the benefit of the self and the attainment of the good, and the avoidance of the harm of the self and the avoidance of the bad. They are free from greed-filled possessions. They are free from attachment. Or, even if they are not free from attachment, they are content with what they have. Or, they have overcome greed. Therefore, they are content. Such great men do not perform sinful karmas, which are acquired and produced by wrong practices and bad conduct. Somewhere, the reading "lobhabhayadatiita:" is found. Here, "lobhasya bhayam cha" is the analysis. In the summary, there is a compound of duality. Therefore, there is a compound of duality here. Or, "lobhad bhayam" is also a possible analysis. Its meaning is that great men are beyond greed. They are content. By interpreting it in this way, there is no fear of redundancy, because by saying that they are beyond greed, the negation of the negation is expressed, and by saying that they are content, the positive aspect is presented. That is, by accepting the one who is beyond greed, the absence of all greed is indicated here, and by saying that they are content, it is stated that even if they are not free from attachment, they do not have intense greed. The sutrakara, while describing the absence of greed, shows the importance of greed among other passions. Its essence is that those who become beyond greed certainly do not commit sins.

They, the ones who have overcome the past, present, and future, know the world as it is. These leaders are not led by others, they are themselves Buddhas, the enders of the cycle of birth and death.

Page #550:
---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

The great souls who are free from greed, what are they like? The Sutrakar reveals that they are free from attachment, or have very little attachment, or attachment that is almost non-existent. They know the joys and sorrows of the beings of the five-astakaya world, in their past, present, and future lives, as they truly are, without any distortion. They do not see things in a distorted way, like the Vibhangajnanis. The Agamas say: "Bante! A man who is attached to Maya and has a false vision, who has renounced the world and lives in the city of Rajagriha, does he know the forms of the city of Varanasi, the material objects, or does he see them?" The answer is: "He sees them, but he sees them with some distortion." And so on. But those who know the past, present, and future, the direct knowers, the Kevala-Jnani, and the fourteen-previous-life-knowers, the indirect knowers, lead the Bhavyas, who desire to cross the cycle of birth and death, towards liberation. They give them good advice. They are self-enlightened. Therefore, no one else can enlighten them. That is, no one else guides them. In terms of attaining what is beneficial and avoiding what is harmful, no one else is their leader or guide. They are self-enlightened, Tirthankaras, Ganadharas, etc., who end the karmas that are the cause of the cycle of birth and death. Here, the word "hu" is used in the sense of the word "cha" or as an adjective, as has been explained before.

As long as these great souls do not end the cycle of birth and death, the Sutrakar says that they show them what they should not do.

They do not do it, nor do they cause it to be done, being disgusted by the fear of harming beings. The wise, who are always vigilant, avoid wrong conduct, and some become wise through knowledge.

**Commentary:**

The direct knowers and indirect knowers, who are worthy of being known, are disgusted by the sinful karma of harming beings, and therefore they do not do it themselves, nor do they cause it to be done by others. They do not even approve of others doing it. Similarly, they do not themselves speak falsehoods, nor do they cause others to speak falsehoods, nor do they approve of others speaking falsehoods. And so on, with all the other great vows. Therefore, "always" means at all times.

Page #551:
---------------------------
The 'Yatas' who are restrained from sinful actions and bow down to various practices of restraint, become great. Who are they? - They are the 'Dhira' great men. Similarly, some knowing the object of renunciation and acceptance, and knowing it correctly from the word 'api', become fearless, knowing that what the Jinas have preached is the only path to liberation, and thus become determined to destroy karma. Or, there is another reading, 'Vinnatti Vira Ya Bhavanti Ege', 'Eke' - some are those who are heavy with karma, of little strength, who call themselves heroes by mere knowledge, not by practice. And liberation is not achieved by knowledge alone. For,
"Having studied the scriptures, many become fools, but he who is active is a wise man.
Consider the medicine for the sick, not just knowledge, cures the disease." ||1.17||

Commentary - Those who abhor sinful acts and know the objects of knowledge, do not themselves commit sins, nor cause others to do so, nor approve of those who are engaged in sinful acts, out of fear of oppression and violence against sentient beings, both seen and unseen. They do not themselves speak falsehoods, nor cause others to do so, nor approve of those who do so. Similarly, this sequence should be applied to other great vows. Thus, they remain always restrained, free from sinful actions, and engaged in various forms of religious practices. Who are they? In answer to this question, it is said that they are the 'Dhira', the patient, great men. And there are many such virtuous men who, knowing the object of renunciation and acceptance, and knowing it correctly, according to the meaning of the word 'api' used here, become fearless, knowing that what the Tirthankaras have preached is the only path to liberation, and thus become determined to destroy karma. Or, they conquer the trials and tribulations. Thus, they are 'Vira', valiant. Here, the reading 'Vinnatti Vira Ya Bhavanti Ege' is also found. This means that some who are burdened with heavy karma, of little strength, call themselves heroes by mere knowledge, not by practice. But liberation is not achieved by knowledge alone. Therefore, it is said - Even after studying the scriptures, many remain fools, devoid of wisdom. In reality, the wise man is he who practices the actions or conduct described in the scriptures. Because mere contemplation of medicine does not cure the disease.

"Small bodies and large bodies, all these he sees as himself.
The enlightened one, free from delusion, should enter the order in this great world." ||1.18||

Shadow - Small bodies and large bodies, all these he sees as himself.
The enlightened one, free from delusion, should enter the order in this great world.

Translation - In this world, there are beings with small bodies and beings with large bodies. Knowing all these as equal to himself, the enlightened one, the observer of the truth, should enter the order in the presence of the restrained, virtuous ones.

Commentary - What are those beings? Out of fear, he says - Some are 'Dahre', small, slow, subtle, or whatever, all these are beings. And those who are 'Vuddha', with large bodies, all these he sees as equal to himself.

The Sutra of the Sri Sutra Kritanga says, "One should see all beings in the world as oneself. Just as my life is finite, so too are the lives of all other beings, including the Kuntha. Just as I experience suffering, so too do all other beings. They are distressed by suffering. The Agamas say, 'O Bhanta! How does a being with an earth body experience suffering when it is afflicted?'"  Therefore, one should not attack or harm any being.  Whoever sees this, truly sees. 

Thus, one should contemplate the vastness of this world. It is vast because it is filled with beings of six types, from the most subtle to the most gross. Or, it is vast because it is without beginning or end.  Even though some beings may never attain liberation, the world is still vast because it is composed of six substances and extends to fourteen regions.  However, it is also vast in terms of time and existence, because it is without beginning or end, and because it is infinite in terms of its cycles of existence.  Thus, one should contemplate the world in this way.

A wise person who has realized the truth understands that all beings are impermanent and that there is no happiness in this world of suffering.  Therefore, such a person should live among the "unmindful" (those who are not practicing restraint) and practice restraint.  Or, if they are wise, they should live among the "mindful" (those who are practicing restraint) and practice restraint. 

(Verse 18)

**Commentary:**

Who are the beings that one should not harm?  The Sutrakar says that even the smallest beings, such as the Kuntha, and other subtle beings, are all living beings.  Those with a monkey body are also living beings.  A person who sees the truth sees all beings as equal to themselves.  They understand that all beings have the same amount of life, just as their own life is finite.  Just as they experience suffering, so too do all other beings.  They are distressed by suffering.  Therefore, the Agamas say, "O Bhanta! How does a being with an earth body experience suffering when it is afflicted?"  One should not attack or harm any being, because they are all living beings.  Whoever sees this, truly sees.

A person who sees the truth understands the vastness of this world.  It is vast because it is filled with beings of six types, from the most subtle to the most gross.  Or, it is vast because it is without beginning or end.  Even though some beings may never attain liberation, the world is still vast because it is composed of six substances and extends to fourteen regions.  However, it is also vast in terms of time and existence, because it is without beginning or end, and because it is infinite in terms of its cycles of existence.  Thus, one should contemplate the world in this way.

A wise person who has realized the truth understands that all beings are impermanent and that there is no happiness in this world of suffering.  Therefore, such a person should live among the "unmindful" (those who are not practicing restraint) and practice restraint.  Or, if they are wise, they should live among the "mindful" (those who are practicing restraint) and practice restraint. 

(Verse 19)

**Shadow:**

He who knows the truth of himself and others, is free from himself and others.  He who is like a light, should always dwell with those who are seeking the truth.

**Translation:**

He who knows the Dharma, whether through his own efforts or through the efforts of others, and teaches it, is able to protect himself and others from evil.  He who contemplates the Dharma again and again, should always dwell with those who are seeking the truth.

---------------------------
**The Study of Samvasarana**

One should always reside in the presence of the luminous, wise, and knowledgeable Muni, who embodies the essence of Dharma.

**Commentary:**

The one who is omniscient, who knows all the objects in the three worlds, and who teaches others about them, is worthy of respect. Similarly, the one who is a Ganadhara, who knows the objects from the Tirthankaras and others, and teaches them to others, is also worthy of respect. Such a person, who knows what is right and wrong, is capable of saving himself from the cycle of birth and death, and also saving others through his teachings.

One should always serve such a luminous being, who is omniscient and knows everything, and who is a Tirthankara or a Ganadhara. Such a person is like the moon, the sun, and a lamp, illuminating the path to liberation. One who desires his own welfare and is troubled by the suffering of the world should consider himself fortunate to be in the presence of such a being.

It is said: "One who is devoted to knowledge, who is steadfast in his faith and conduct, and who does not abandon the company of his Guru, is truly blessed."

**Who should do this?**

The text explains that those who contemplate the fruits of their actions, who understand the value of human life, the path of righteousness, and the ten virtues of a virtuous person, and who practice these virtues, should always reside in the company of their Guru.

Alternatively, those who always serve the luminous and wise Acharya are the ones who understand the scriptures and who teach others about the world, which is comprised of five elements and fourteen realms.

**Verse 20:**

"One who knows oneself, who knows the world, who knows the past and the future, who knows birth and death, is truly wise."

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Verse 21:**

Oh, the one who knows the **āsrava** (influx of karma), **samvara** (restriction of influx), **duḥkha** (suffering), and **nirjarā** (cessation of karma), is worthy of speaking about **kriyāvāda** (the doctrine of action).

**Verse 20:**

The one who knows the **ātman** (soul), the **loka** (world), the **gati** (path of transmigration), the **anāgati** (non-transmigration), the **śāśvata** (eternal), the **aśāśvata** (non-eternal), the **jāti** (birth), the **maraṇa** (death), and the **janoppapāta** (rebirth), is worthy of speaking about **kriyāvāda**.

**Commentary:**

The one who knows the **ātman** (soul) as distinct from the body, the source of happiness and suffering, and who acts for the benefit of the soul, is truly knowledgeable about the **ātman**. The one who knows the **loka** (world) in its entirety, including the animate and inanimate, the realms of the gods, humans, and animals, and the infinite space, is truly knowledgeable about the **loka**. The one who knows the **gati** (path of transmigration) of beings, how they come to be in the realms of hell, animals, humans, and gods, and the **anāgati** (non-transmigration), the cessation of transmigration, which is achieved through right faith, knowledge, and conduct, is truly knowledgeable about the **gati** and **anāgati**. The one who knows the **śāśvata** (eternal), which is the eternal nature of the soul, and the **aśāśvata** (non-eternal), which is the impermanent nature of the world, is truly knowledgeable about the **śāśvata** and **aśāśvata**. The one who knows the **jāti** (birth), the process of birth in the realms of hell, animals, humans, and gods, and the **maraṇa** (death), the process of death, and the **janoppapāta** (rebirth), the process of rebirth, is truly knowledgeable about the **jāti**, **maraṇa**, and **janoppapāta**. The one who knows the **vikuṭṭana** (torments) of beings in the lower realms, the **āsrava** (influx of karma), the **samvara** (restriction of influx), the **duḥkha** (suffering), and the **nirjarā** (cessation of karma), is truly knowledgeable about the **kriyāvāda**.

**Explanation:**

The **kriyāvāda** is the doctrine of action, which explains the relationship between karma and rebirth. It is based on the understanding that all beings are subject to the law of karma, which dictates their rebirth in accordance with their actions. The **kriyāvāda** also explains the path to liberation from the cycle of rebirth, which is achieved through the practice of right faith, knowledge, and conduct.

##  The Study of the Samvasarana

**The Sorrow** is the arising of the non-existent, and its cause, whoever knows, and **the Happiness** which is the opposite of that, whoever knows, by penance, whoever is purified, this is said - whoever knows the causes of the bondage of karma and the causes of its opposite equally, thus:

"As many are the types, the causes of the bondage of the world, so many are the opposites of those, the causes of the liberation of Nirvana." ||1||

He alone truly deserves to speak, what is that? He says - the **Action-Theory**, that there is a soul, there is merit, there is sin, and there is the fruit of past actions, such a theory. Thus - the soul, non-soul, restraint of inflow, bondage, merit, sin, purification, liberation - these nine substances are included in two verses. There, by "whoever knows himself", the substance of the soul is understood, by "world", the substance of the soul is understood, and by "going, not going, eternal, etc.", the nature of these two is shown. Similarly, inflow and restraint are included in their own form. By "sorrow", however, bondage, merit, and sin are taken, because sorrow is inseparable from them. Purification, however, is not included in its own definition, but the fruit of that, liberation, should be understood. Thus, these are the substances, and by accepting them, the Action-Theory is accepted.

Whoever "knows", accepts, he truly knows the Action-Theory. But, is the rightness of the theory not established by the knowledge of the substances mentioned by other schools? Why is it not accepted? Because the names of the substances mentioned are not established. Thus, in the Nyaya school, sixteen substances are mentioned - **proof, object of proof, doubt, purpose, example, principle, constituent, reasoning, determination, debate, quibbling, fallacy, deception, category, refutation, and position**. There, the **object of proof** is that by which the delimitation of the substance is done, in the form of **avoidance** and **acceptance** (restraint and activity). And that is **proof**, which is of four types - **perception, inference, comparison, and verbal testimony**. There, the knowledge arising from the contact of the sense organ with the object is **perception**, which is **unnameable**, **invariable**, and **determinative**. That is, the knowledge arising from the relation between the sense organ and the object, not the manifested knowledge, not happiness, etc., is **unnameable**, because it is nameable by verbal testimony; and because it is **invariable**, it is not variable like the knowledge of two moons. **Determinative** means that it is **certain**. There, its perceptibility is not appropriate, because where the self is directly present for the grasping of the object, that is perception. And that is only **attention**, **mind**, and **self**. And this is also through another **condition**. Inference is **indirect** like the inference of activity. **Conventional perception** may be there, but convention is not relevant in the investigation of truth. Inference is also of three types - **from the cause**, **from the effect**, and **from the general**. There, **inference from the cause** is like the previous, **inference from the effect** is like the remainder, and **inference from the general** is like seeing a single blooming flower and concluding that all flowers are blooming, or seeing the movement of Devadatta from one place to another and inferring movement in the sun. There, also, **incompatibility** is the means of inference, not the cause, etc., because without it, there is variability in the relation between the cause and the effect. Where it exists, there, the relation between the cause and the effect, etc., is seen as the inferred and the means of inference. For example, "There will be a chariot rising from the sight of the constellation Krittika." It is said:

"Incompatibility, where it is, what is the use of the three? Incompatibility, where it is, what is the use of the three?" ||1||

Moreover, if perception is not authoritative, then inference preceding it is authoritative. **Comparison** is the well-known means of proving the object to be proved, like "A cow is like a bull." Here, the meaning of comparison is the understanding of the relation between the similar and the dissimilar. Here, also, it is established that it is a type of inference, because it is included in the established incompatibility, and therefore, its separate authority is not established. If there is no incompatibility, then there is variability, and therefore, comparison is not authoritative. **Verbal testimony** is also not all authoritative. What then? Only the **scripture** composed by the **knowledgeable** is authoritative. And it is not reasonable that there is another knowledgeable person besides the omniscient. This is also discussed elsewhere. Further, all this proof is the knowledge of the self, and knowledge is a quality of the self. If it is a separate substance, then there is a contradiction. If they are dependent on the sense organ and the object for the grasping of the object of proof, then they are dependent, but not reasonable. Thus, because they are absent without substance, and because their grasping is established in the grasping of that, it is not reasonable to accept them separately. The **object of proof**, however, is the self, body, sense organ, object, intellect, mind, activity, fault, death, absence, fruit, sorrow, and liberation. There, the self is the perceiver and enjoyer of all, and it is inferred from hatred, effort, happiness, sorrow, and knowledge. And it is accepted as the substance of the soul. The body is the place of its enjoyment, the sense organs are the instruments of enjoyment, and the objects of the sense organs are the objects of enjoyment. This body, etc., is also mentioned by us in the understanding of the soul and non-soul. Enjoyment is intellect, and this is a special type of knowledge. And it is accepted as a quality of the soul, and therefore, it is accepted as the soul.

Page #556:
---------------------------
The **Sri Sutra Kritanga Sutra (Neno)** states that the mind is the internal organ of all objects, and it is the sign of the simultaneous arising of knowledge. The mind is also a substance, and it is grasped by the non-living substance (pudgala) through its own grasping. The mind as a state is a quality of the soul, and it is grasped by the soul through its own grasping.

The cause of the soul's experience of pleasure and pain is **pravritti** (activity). It is not appropriate to consider it as a separate entity, because **pravritti** is the desire of the soul, and it is a quality of the soul. The soul, through its own intention, is a special kind of knowledge. The soul's defilement is called **dosha** (fault). For example, the soul's belief that this body is not eternal, because it is not without beginning, and it is not without end, because its lineage is infinite, is a **dosha**. This belief, whether it is about the body being without beginning or without end, is a **dosha**. **Raga** (attachment), **dvesha** (aversion), **moha** (delusion), etc., are also **doshas**. These **doshas** are also included in the soul's intention, and therefore they are not to be spoken of separately.

The state of non-existence after death, or the existence of the afterlife, is also grasped by the soul through its own grasping of the living and non-living substances. The fruit of this grasping is the experience of pleasure and pain. This experience is also included in the qualities of the soul, and therefore it is not to be spoken of separately. The word "suffering" also refers to various types of obstacles, and therefore it does not go beyond the fruit. **Moksha** (liberation) is the cessation of the cycle of birth and death, and it is characterized by the elimination of all suffering. We have grasped this **moksha** through our own understanding.

**Sanskaya** (doubt) is a perception that is not definitive. It is also a quality of the soul, like definitive knowledge. The **prayojana** (purpose) is that which is used to motivate action. It is also a quality of the soul, because it is a special kind of desire. **Drishtanta** (example) is a statement that is free from contradiction. It is either a living or non-living substance. However, it is not appropriate to consider it as a separate entity, because it would lead to an infinite regress, and it would be grasped again in the future through the grasping of its parts.

There are four types of **siddhantas** (principles):

1. **Sarvatantra Siddhanta** (principle that is not contradicted by any other principle and has the most meaning): For example, the sense organs, such as touch, etc., grasp the objects of the senses, such as touch, etc., through the means of knowledge.
2. **Samanatantra Siddha** (principle that is established by the same principle): For example, the Sankhyas believe that the soul is not born, and it is not destroyed. As it is said, "From non-existence, existence does not arise, and from existence, non-existence does not arise."
3. **Adhikarana Siddhanta** (principle that is established by the dependence on another principle): For example, the soul, which is different from the sense organs, exists, because it grasps the same object through sight and touch. The dependent principles are: 1) the existence of the object, 2) the diversity of the sense organs, 3) the sense organs having fixed objects, 4) the signs of grasping their objects, 5) the sense organs being the means of knowledge for the knower, 6) the substance that is different from the qualities of touch, etc., 7) the locus of the qualities, 8) the conscious beings having fixed objects. These principles are established by the establishment of the previous principle. The previous principle cannot exist without these principles.
4. **Abhyupagam Siddhanta** (principle that is established by the assumption of an unexamined object): For example, when someone asks, "What is sound?", someone might say, "Sound is a substance." Then they might ask, "Is it eternal or non-eternal?" This is an example of this type of principle. All four types of principles do not go beyond special knowledge. Special knowledge is a quality of the soul, and qualities are grasped through the grasping of their locus. Therefore, they are not to be considered separately.

The **avayavas** (parts) of an argument are: **pratijna** (statement), **hetu** (reason), **udaharana** (example), **upanaya** (application), and **nigamana** (conclusion). The **pratijna** is the statement of the proposition, such as "Sound is eternal or non-eternal." The **hetu** is the reason that supports the proposition, such as "Because it is the nature of sound to be produced." The **udaharana** is the example that illustrates the proposition, such as "A pot." The **upanaya** is the application of the reason to the proposition, such as "Sound is non-eternal because it is created, just like a pot." The **nigamana** is the conclusion that restates the proposition and the reason, such as "Therefore, sound is non-eternal."

If these five parts are only words, then they are grasped by the non-living substance (pudgala) through its own grasping, because the words are made of pudgalas. If they are knowledge, then they are grasped by the soul through its own grasping, because knowledge is a quality of the soul. If we assume that special knowledge is a separate entity, then there would be an infinite number of entities, because there are many types of special knowledge.

**Tarka** (reasoning) is a perception that is based on the possibility of something happening, and it is characterized by a critical examination of the meaning. For example, "It is possible that a man will stand here." This is also a special kind of knowledge. Scholars do not accept the idea that special knowledge is a separate entity from the knower, because they are not different.

**Nirnaya** (decision) is a perception that is definitive, and it arises after doubt and reasoning. It is also not different from knowledge. Furthermore, it is not appropriate to consider it separately, because it is included in the means of knowledge, such as perception, etc., because it is definitive.

There are three types of **katha** (discourse): **vada** (debate), **jalpa** (wrangling), and **vitanda** (sophistry). **Vada** is a debate that is based on the means of knowledge, reasoning, and the use of arguments. It is not contradictory to the principles, and it is supported by the five parts of an argument. It involves the

The Study of Samvasarana. Truth cannot be understood through deceit, trickery, etc., because deceit, etc., is used to deceive others, and it does not lead to the understanding of truth. Even though there is a difference, these things are not meaningful, because whatever truly exists in reality is what should be accepted as true. Arguments, however, are based on the will of the individual and are therefore inconsistent. Therefore, they are not meaningful. Moreover, arguments that follow the will of the individual can also be found in things like cockfighting and gambling, where there is a taking of sides and opposing sides. Therefore, they would also lead to the attainment of truth, which is not desirable.

Invalid, absolute, and contradictory fallacies are called fallacies because they appear to be arguments. In this case, even valid arguments do not establish truth, let alone fallacies. For example, whatever is definite and real deserves to be considered truth. Arguments, however, are not definite, as they are sometimes valid and sometimes invalid in relation to the object of the argument.

Now, deceit is the distortion of meaning or the possibility of alternative meanings. In this case, when a specific meaning is intended and stated, the speaker's intention is to create an alternative meaning, which is verbal deceit. For example, "This new blanket is Devadatta's." Here, the speaker's intention is that the blanket is new, and there is a difference in the meaning of the compound word and the expanded form. In this case, the deceiver would say, "You said that this is a new blanket." And the other person would deny it, saying, "No, I did not." In this case, the statement is meaningless. If it is not deceit, then it is truth. And if it is not truth, then it is deceit, because truth is the form of reality. Therefore, the statement "deceit is truth" is an unnecessary use of language.

Fallacious criticisms are types of criticisms. In this case, even valid criticism does not establish truth, because it is not definite. The indefiniteness is that what is valid criticism in one case is a fallacious criticism in another case. And because criticism is based on the ability of the individual, the indefiniteness of the establishment of criticism and counter-criticism is why there are types of fallacious criticisms. This is because they are not real.

During an argument, the point at which the arguer or the opponent is refuted is called the point of refutation. This is the statement of the arguer's weakness, and the opponent's refutation of it. Anything else that is said by the logicians is mere chatter. This includes the denial of the proposition, the substitution of a different proposition, the contradiction of the proposition, etc. When examined, these things do not deserve to be considered points of refutation. You are also capable of making a mistake, but this does not deserve to be considered truth. The speaker's virtues and faults are considered in relation to the object, inference, and the subject matter, but not in relation to truth. Therefore, what the logicians say should not be considered truth. Their statements are flawed.

Nor is the truth as stated by the Vaisheshikas. For example, substance, quality, action, generality, particularity, and inherence are considered truth. In this case, there are nine substances: earth, water, fire, air, space, time, direction, soul, and mind. In this case, the distinct substantiality of earth, water, and fire is not established. For example, the same atoms, through experimentation and observation, transform into earth, etc., but they do not abandon their own substantiality. And the difference in state does not justify the difference in substance, because it leads to an absurd conclusion. We also accept the substantiality of space and time. However, the substantiality of directions as parts of space is not established, because it leads to an absurd conclusion. The substantiality of the soul is also accepted, as it is characterized by its use in relation to the body alone. And the mind is included in the substance of matter, as a particular type of matter (like an atom). And the mind and its states are included in the soul, because they are qualities of the soul.

Even though they say that earth is earth because of the quality of earthness, this is just their own process. For there is no separate earthness from earth, so that earth would be earth because of its connection to earthness. Rather, everything that exists is characterized by generality and particularity, and has the nature of both Narasimha and the lion. As it is said:

"There is no connection, because of difference, nor is there difference, because of connection. A pot is different from clay, because of the connection of two types of clay." (1)

And:

"A man is not a lion because of lionhood, nor is a lion a man because of manhood. Because of difference, there is a difference in kind between the objects of sound and knowledge." (1)

And so on.

Now, the qualities of form, taste, smell, and touch are qualities that are particular to substances. And number, quantity, separateness, conjunction, disjunction, otherness, and non-otherness are general qualities, because they apply to all substances. And intellect, happiness, sorrow, desire, aversion, effort, virtue, vice, and impressions are qualities of the soul. Heaviness is a quality of earth and water. Wetness is a quality of earth, water, and fire. The quality of oiliness is a quality of water, like the quality of speed. The quality of sound is a quality of space, and it is embodied in the impressions of substances.

Page #558:
---------------------------
The Sutra of the Sri Sutra Kritanga, in which numbers and other general qualities are not qualities because they are dependent on the nature of substances like form, etc., and are not qualities because they are dependent on the nature of substances like form, etc. Even if they were, there would still be no separate arrangement of qualities, because the destruction of the nature of the substance would result in the absence of separate existence. Therefore, it is appropriate to grasp the substance by grasping the substance, as it is said, "The substance is the synonym of the quality" (Tattvartha. A. 5 Sutra). Therefore, there is no separate existence. Moreover, its existence is called its essence, and the perception of existence is that of the quality, because the insertion of the word in the substance due to the existence of the quality is done by the word "tvatala". For example, a pot is red, the water is its food, and it is called a pot by all these qualities. Here, the existence of the pot is potness, the existence of red is redness, the existence of the food is foodness, and the existence of the water is waterness. Therefore, due to the existence of the qualities of the pot, the general red quality, action, and substance, the word "kutaka", which is a large, round, water-holding, etc., is inserted in the substance, and that is the "tvatala". But what is the quality called "red"? What is its existence? And what is the substance in which the word is inserted, so that there is a perception of existence? Now, should the existence of red be redness? It should be, by convention. For example, the word "red" is conventionally used as a substance, and its general existence is redness. But convention is not used in the consideration of essence, because it is fulfilled in the establishment of the word. And the word is not a quality of space, because it is material, and space is immaterial. The rest is just a process, not a part of the defect of the means. And action is also inseparable from the substance, and it is not appropriate to consider it as a separate quality with a different support. Now, what about the general? It is of two kinds: the ultimate and the penultimate. The ultimate is called "maha-satta", which pervades substances like the earth, etc. And it is said, "Because of the word 'sat', there is that existence in substances, qualities, and actions." The penultimate is the essence of substance, quality, and action. Now, the separate existence of "maha-satta" is not appropriate, because the perception of "sat" in it, is it dependent on another existence or is it self-existent? If it is dependent on another existence, then there is the same dilemma, and therefore, there is no end. If it is self-existent, then there will be a self-existent perception of "sat" in substances, etc., and what about the existence of another existence, like the horn of a rabbit? Is it hypothetical? Moreover, is the perception of "sat" in substances, etc., due to their existence or due to their being existent? If the perception of "sat" is self-existent in the existent, then what about it? But in the case of the non-existent, there would be a perception of "sat" in the existence of the horn of a rabbit, etc., because of the existence of "sat" in them. And it is said,
"Things are self-existent, but what about the existence of the existent?
It would not be so in the non-existent, because it would be a universal implication."
And so on. This same defect is applicable to the penultimate general, because the conditions and results are the same. Moreover, we also accept that the object is of the form of the general and the particular, and because it is inseparable from it in some way, it is grasped by grasping the substance. Now, what about the particulars? They are dependent on others because they are the cause of the perception of complete difference. Here, it is to be considered that the perception of particularity in them is not caused by another particularity, because of the fear of endlessness. And if it is self-dependent, then there would be a perception of particularity in substances, etc., as well, because of the particularities that are different from substances, etc.? But the particularities that are not different from substances are also dependent on us, because everything is of the nature of the general and the particular. This is just a process, just as the ultimate particulars are the eternal substances, and the eternal substances are of four kinds: atoms, liberated souls, liberated minds, and liberated bodies. Because of their being appointed, they should be discarded. Now, what about "samavaya"? It is called "samavaya" which is the perception of the support and the supported, which are not self-existent. It is also eternal and one, and it is dependent on others. Because of its eternality, the "samavaya" is also eternal, and if it is non-eternal, then it would also be non-eternal, because it is the support. And because of its oneness, there would be oneness of all the "samavaya"s, but it is not one. Moreover, this "samavaya" is a relation, and because it is two-fold, it is self-existent. Just as the stick and the stick-holder, and the destruction of the form of the "chakra" in the birth of the "chakra" and the birth of the form of the "chakra" in the destruction of the "chakra", and the arrangement of the form of the "chakra" in the form of the "chakra", just as the milk and the curd, and so on. Even in the Vaisheshika view, the arrangement of the objects is not correct. Now, the exposition of the essence in the Samkhya view is being undertaken. There, creation arises from the union of nature and the self. And nature is the state of the three qualities: sattva, rajas, and tamas. From that, arises the great, from the great arises the ego, from the ego arises the eleven senses, from the senses arise the five subtle elements, and from the subtle elements arise the five gross elements. Consciousness is the nature of the self, and it is the doer, without qualities, and the enjoyer. Now, the qualities like sattva, etc., which are mutually contradictory, cannot exist together in nature and the self without a controller and a possessor, just as the qualities like black and white, etc. And it is not

---------------------------
The study of the Samvara (universal principle) is a great cause for the production of the differences in nature, which are born from the great and other transformations.  Since there is no acceptance of any other object besides this, and since the soul is inactive and incapable of doing anything, the acceptance of differences in nature would lead to the conclusion that there would always be existence or non-existence.  It is said: "Existence and non-existence are always without a cause, because they do not depend on anything else.  For things that depend on something else, there is the possibility of being sometimes and sometimes not."  Furthermore, we see that the Great and the Ego are not different from sensation.  For example, the intellect, determination, and ego are all perceptions of the form "I am happy," "I am unhappy," etc.  These are qualities of the soul because of their nature as consciousness, not because of their nature as matter.  These two are transformations of nature.  Furthermore, the origin of the elements from the subtle elements is not logical.  For example, earth from the subtle element of smell, water from the subtle element of taste, fire from the subtle element of form, air from the subtle element of touch, and space from the subtle element of sound.  This is not logical because if it is said that this happens because of an external object, then it is not logical because they always exist, and they do not create a world like this.  Or if it is said that this happens because of the dependence on each body, then it is not logical because in that case, earth would be characterized by skin, bones, and hardness, water would be characterized by phlegm and blood, fire would be characterized by heat, air would be characterized by breath and exhalation, and space would be characterized by dryness.  This is also not logical because even in the case of some bodies, the origin is from semen and blood, and there is no smell of the subtle elements there.  The existence of the unseen is also inferred.  If we accept the cause, then there would be too much inference.  The origin of eggs, plants, and animals is also inferred to be from something else.  Therefore, the origin of the primary, the Great, the Ego, etc., which is accepted by the Samkhya school in their own way, is accepted by them only because of their attachment to their own view, and it is not logical.  If we accept that the soul is inactive, then it would be destroyed and never created, and there would be no bondage or liberation.  And if it is without qualities, then it would be devoid of knowledge.  Therefore, this is just childish talk.  And since nature is inanimate, it is illogical for it to act for the sake of the soul.  Now, the Buddhist view is examined.  According to them, there are twelve sense spheres, namely: the five senses, the five objects of the senses, the sphere of sound, and the sphere of dharma.  The dharmas are the twelve sense spheres, which are happiness, etc.  There are only two means of knowledge: perception and inference.  The five senses (the physical senses) are not involved in the perception of the soul, but the mental senses are involved in the perception of the soul.  The five objects of the senses are not involved in the perception of the non-soul, and they should not be perceived separately.  The sphere of sound is perceived by the soul because of its material nature, and it is not logical for it to be a separate object for each individual.  The sphere of dharma, which is happiness and suffering, is either a form of pleasure or pain, and therefore, because of its nature as a quality of the soul, it is included in the soul.  And if its cause is karma, then because of its material nature, it is a non-soul.  The Buddhists consider perception to be non-conceptual, and because of its uncertain nature, it does not lead to action or inaction.  Therefore, it is not a valid means of knowledge.  And because of its invalidity, inference, which is based on it, is also invalid.  The rest is the refutation of objections, which is discussed elsewhere, and it is not discussed here.  In this way, the refutation of the views of the Mimamsa school, which are stated in their own texts, should be done with one's own intelligence.  Since their objects are completely contrary to the world, they are not directly discussed here.  Therefore, the nine or seven objects, which are established by the remaining evidence, are true, and the knowledge of them is the cause of action, not the knowledge of other objects.
Commentary:  The person who knows that the soul is transmigratory, different from the body, and the basis of happiness and suffering, and who acts for the benefit of the soul, is the knower of the soul.  The person who knows the soul in its true form through the perception of "I am," is the knower of the entire world in its form of action and inaction.  That knower of the soul is the person who is able to speak and discuss this theory of action, which is the soul, etc.  Here, at the end of the second verse or stanza, there is action, meaning that the two words are a pair.  Like a man standing in a theater with both hands on his waist, he knows the world that is united with the body and the infinite space that is indicated by the word "cha," which is limited and not a world.  And he knows the coming and going of beings, i.e., he knows where the hellish beings, animals, humans, and gods have come from.  He knows how they are born as hellish beings, etc., because of their karma.  He knows where they go so that they do not return again.  The word "cha" indicates the right faith, knowledge, and conduct, which are the means to it.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

Here, the meaning of Anagati is Siddhi. It is attained by the complete and total shedding of all karmas. It is located in a specific place in the sky, at the forefront of the universe. It is eternal and without any internal divisions. According to the Dravyarthic Nay, all substances are eternal or permanent, and according to the Paryayarthic Nay, all are impermanent, non-eternal, and constantly perishable. He who knows this. The word 'cha' used here refers to one who knows all substances as both eternal and non-eternal, and both simultaneously. The Agamas state that the Nairyik-Narak Jiva is eternal according to the Dravyarthic Nay and non-eternal according to the Paryayarthic Nay. Similarly, one should know the same about other Tiryanch etc. Alternatively, Nirvana is called eternal and Samsara is called impermanent because the beings in Samsara move around due to the results of their own actions. He who knows the origin of the four castes - Narak, Tiryanch, Manushya, and Deva - and the death caused by the depletion of lifespan, is called Jan. He knows the rebirth of the Jivas, their Satvas. While contemplating birth, one should mention the place of origin of the Jivas, their Yoni. That Yoni is with consciousness, without consciousness, mixed, cold, hot, mixed, closed, open, and mixed. Thus, it is divided into twenty-seven categories. Tiryanch and Manushya die. The Jyotishka and Vaimanika Devas undergo Chyaavan. And the Bhavanpati, Vyantar, and Narakas undergo Udvartana. He knows those who are born. Rebirth happens in Narakas and Devas.

Sattva-beings experience the fruits of their own actions. The Duskrut Karmakari - sinners - experience various types of bodily pain in the lower realms like Naraka, etc., caused by birth, old age, death, illness, and sorrow. He who knows this. The word 'cha' indicates that he knows the means of eliminating pain. The implication is that all living beings from the Sarvarth Siddha Devaloka to the seventh Naraka are bound by karmas. Even there, those who have the heaviest karmas go to the Naraka called Apratisthan. He who knows this. The eight types of karmas are Ashravit - they enter the soul, become attached to it, and are called Ashrava. He who knows whether it is in the form of Pranatipat - violence - or whether it is based on Raga-Dvesha or Mithyadarshan. He who knows the Nirodha of Ashravas - the restraint of all mental, verbal, and physical activities, which is called Samvara. The word 'cha' indicates that he knows the Puny and Papa. He knows the suffering that arises as a result of the unbearable Uday and its cause, and he knows the happiness that is its opposite. He knows that it is destroyed by Tapas. The meaning is that he knows the causes of Karma-bandha and the causes of the destruction of karmas, which are opposite to bandha. It has been said that just as there are as many causes for the attachment to Samsara, there are also as many causes for attaining Moksha. He who knows this can truly and accurately explain it. Who can explain it? In answering this question, it is said that he can explain Kriyavad. The existence of the Jiva, Puny, Papa, and the fruits of past actions is called Kriyavad. Through the above two verses, the nine substances - Jiva, Ajiv, Ashrava, Samvara, Bandha, Puny, Papa, Nirjara, and Moksha - have been grasped. By saying 'he who knows the soul', the Jiva substance has been explained. By mentioning the universe, the Ajiv substance has been explained. And by mentioning motion, Anagati, and eternity, their nature has been explained. Ashrava and Samvara have been explained along with their own nature. And by mentioning suffering, Bandha, Puny, and Papa have been grasped, because they are inseparable from suffering.

---------------------------
The study of Samvasarana is an inseparable relationship, without which suffering does not arise. Nirjara has been mentioned with its own name and its fruit, Moksha, has also been accepted. Thus, only these substances are useful in attaining Moksha. Therefore, the acceptance of their existence is the acceptance of Kriyavada. One who knows and accepts these substances is truly the knower of Kriyavada. It is said that why do you not accept as a Samyakvadi one who knows the substances propounded in other philosophies? In response to this, it is said that in Nyaya philosophy, Pramana, Prameya, Sanshaya, Prayojana, Drishtaanta, Siddhanta, Avayava, Tarka, Nirnaya, Vada, Jalapa, Vitanda, Hetvabhasa, Chala, Jati and Nigraha Sthana - these sixteen substances are accepted. Among these, the substance that determines the nature of the substances due to the renunciation of the substances that are to be abandoned and the inclination towards the substances that are to be adopted is called Pramana. Pramana is that by which substances are measured, tested and known in the right way. There are four types of Pramana: Pratyaksha, Anumana, Upamana and Shabda. The knowledge that arises from the proximity of the sense organ and the object, is inexpressible by words, free from defects and decisive in nature is Pratyaksha. This means that which arises from the relationship of the sense organ and the object but is not expressed. Which is not in the form of happiness etc. but is knowledge. It is not expressed by words because the knowledge that is obtained by words is expressible. In Nyaya philosophy, that which is not contradictory, defective or illusory, which is decisive, like the knowledge of two moons, is called Pratyaksha, but this form of Pratyaksha is not logical. Because here, the soul is self-pervasive in grasping the meaning - without depending on anything else, the senses do not do so, that knowledge of the soul is called Pratyaksha. Avadhijnana, Manahparyaya Jnana and Kevala Jnana are Pratyaksha, but the knowledge that occurs through the indirect sense organ, which Nyaya philosophy calls Pratyaksha, is indirect like Anumana etc., not Pratyaksha. It can be called Pratyaksha in a formal sense, but where there is a context of true thinking, formality does not prevail.
According to Nyaya philosophy, Purvavat, Seshavat and Samanyatodrishta - these are the three types of Anumana. Where the cause is inferred from the effect, it is called Purvavat. Where the cause is inferred from the effect, it is called Seshavat. Seeing mangoes on a mango tree, it is inferred that all mango trees in the world have mangoes. This type of inference is called Samanyatodrishta. Or, seeing a person like Devadatta moving from one place to another, inferring motion in the sun is called Samanyatodrishta, but this principle propounded in Nyaya Shastra is illogical because otherwise, non-occurrence is the reason for inference. Cause etc. are not because otherwise, without non-occurrence, the defect of contradiction of the cause towards the effect is visible. But where there is non-occurrence, the relationship of the object and the object is visible even in the absence of the cause-effect relationship. For example, it is said that the chariot, the star (Mrigashira) constellation will rise because the Krittika constellation is visible. It has been said that where there is non-occurrence, what is the use of Purvavat, Seshavat and Samanyatodrishta, i.e. they have no use. Where there is no non-occurrence, what will be achieved by these three? It is also true that when Pratyaksha Pramana, accepted in Nyaya Shastra, does not even come under its category, then the Anumana that occurs before it is also not authentic - it is also not Pramana.

The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states that in the context of **Upamana** (analogy), the **Nyaya Darshan** (philosophy) says that proving an unknown object by comparing it to a known object is called **Upamana Praman** (proof by analogy). For example, just as a cow is, so is a bull. The purpose of this proof is to understand the relationship between the object and its name. However, accepting **Upamana** as a separate proof is not logical because it can be proven by **Anupatti** (non-existence of the opposite). Therefore, **Upamana** is included in **Anumana** (inference). Hence, **Upamana** does not arise as a separate proof. If it is said that **Anupatti** does not occur in the context of **Upamana**, then **Upamana** would be invalid due to the **Vyabhichar** (inconsistency) defect.

Similarly, **Shabda Agama** (scriptural evidence) is not all proof, but only those scriptures written by **Aapta Purush** (reliable person) are valid. **Arhan** (omniscient), **Tirthankar** (spiritual leader) are the only **Aapta Purush**. It is not logical to consider anyone else as **Aapta**. This has been explained elsewhere. All these proofs are in the form of knowledge of the **Atma** (soul). Knowledge is a quality of the **Atma**. Therefore, it is not logical to consider it as a separate entity from the **Atma**. If we do so, then we would have to consider qualities like **Roop** (form), **Ras** (taste), etc., as separate entities from the objects possessing them. If it is said that **Roop**, **Ras**, etc., are the objects of the senses, then you can accept them as separate entities, but it is not logical because they do not exist independently of the substance. Therefore, they are also included in the perception of the substance. Hence, it is not appropriate to accept them as separate entities.

Similarly, the **Nyaya Darshan** considers **Atma**, **Sharira** (body), **Indriyaarth** (objects of senses), **Buddhi** (intellect), **Man** (mind), **Pravritti** (action), **Dosha** (defect), **Pretyaabhav** (afterlife), **Phal** (fruit), **Dukha** (suffering), and **Apavarga** (liberation) as **Pramaya** (objects of knowledge). Among these, **Atma** is considered to be the **Sarvadrishta** (all-seeing), **Sarvabhokta** (all-experiencing). It is said to be inferable through **Ichcha** (desire), **Dvesha** (aversion), **Prayatna** (effort), **Sukha** (pleasure), **Dukha** (suffering), and **Jnana** (knowledge). We, the Jains, have also considered it as the **Jiva** (living being). The **Sharira** is the **Bhogayatan** (object of enjoyment) of the **Atma**, and the **Indriya** (senses) are also **Bhogayatan**. The objects of the senses are **Bhogya** (enjoyable) for the **Atma**. We, the Jains, have also accepted this **Sharira**, etc., as **Jivaajiva** (living and non-living). **Upayoga** (use) is called **Buddhi**. It is a type of **Jnana**. Therefore, it is a quality of the **Jiva**. It is also included in the perception of the **Jiva**. The **Antahkaran** (inner organ) is that which perceives all objects. It is called **Man**. According to the **Nyaya Darshan**, the knowledge of all senses does not arise simultaneously. The **Man** has a collective knowledge of them. From the Jain perspective, it is the **Dravya Man** (substance mind) and is **Paudgalik** (made of **Pudgala**). It is included in the **Ajiva** (non-living). The **Bhav Man** (mental state) is a quality of the **Atma**. It is included in the perception of the **Jiva**. **Pravritti** is the cause of the **Atma's** experience of pleasure and pain. The **Nyaya Darshan** considers it as a separate entity from the **Atma**, which is not logical because **Pravritti** is called **Atmeccha** (desire of the **Atma**). Therefore, it is a quality of the **Atma**. Being in the form of the **Atma's** intention, it is a type of special knowledge. That which contaminates the **Atma** is called **Dosha** (defect). For example, this **Sharira** of the **Atma** is not new, it has been existing since the beginning because it is **Anadi** (beginningless). It is also not the end because it is **Anant** (infinite) from the perspective of the flow of birth and death. Considering this **Sharira** as **Aparva** (new) and **Shant** (peaceful) is also a **Adhyavasaya Dosha** (defect of wrong belief). Or, **Raga** (attachment), **Dvesha** (aversion), and **Moha** (delusion), etc., are called **Dosha**. These **Dosha** are also the specific intention of the **Jiva**. Therefore, they are included in the **Jiva**. Hence, they cannot be called separate entities. The existence of the afterlife is **Pretyaabhav**.

---------------------------
The study of Samvasarana is also acquired through the perception of the living and non-living, along with its means. Experiencing happiness and suffering is called fruit, which is also a category of the living being, hence it falls under the living being. It should not be considered as a separate substance. Suffering takes the form of various obstacles, hence it is also not different from the fruit. That which is the severance of the tradition of birth and death and the destroyer of all suffering is called liberation. We Jains accept it in this form. What is this? Such indeterminate-uncertain knowledge is called doubt. It is also a quality of the soul, just like the knowledge of decision. That which is used, for the sake of which meaning a person is inclined, is called purpose, it is also a special form of desire, hence it is a quality of the soul. That meaning in which there is no difference of opinion between the opponent and the supporter is called an example, it is also other than the living and non-living - it is one, it is connected to one, hence its separate substantiality is not logical because believing so will lead to irrelevance? In Nyaya Darshan, it is later accepted by the perception of the components. There are four types of principles - such as (1) that meaning of one's own scripture which is not contradictory or unfavorable to all other scriptures, or is consistent, is called the universal principle. For example, touch etc. are senses and there are objects of touch etc. senses. The perception of the object by evidence is knowledge, these are universal principles. (2) The principle which is accepted in one scripture but not in other scriptures is called the relative principle, such as those who believe in Sankhya Darshan do not believe in the benefit of the self of the non-existent - the existence of the non-existent substance and the complete destruction of the existent substance. It has been said that the non-existent - the non-existent substance does not have existence and the absence of the existent substance is not non-existence. This principle is not accepted by other philosophies. (3) That which, when proved, proves other substances in a relevant way, is called the principle of argument. For example, there is a knower-knowing soul, different from the senses, because one meaning is perceived from sight and touch, there many meanings are perceived in a relevant way, such as the senses are different, they perceive their own definite objects. The perception of their own objects is the identification of their existence, they are the means of knowledge of the knower-soul
The substance which is the argument-support of those categories, different from the individual from the categories, is the substance. Consciousness is not fixed in its object, it does not have any fixed object, it is present in all objects. Here, after the first meaning is proved, all these meanings are proved on their own because without them, the first meaning is not possible, hence this is the principle of argument. (4) Accepting a meaning without examination-examination and then examining its characteristics is the principle of assumption, such as - in the context of the consideration of the word, someone says - the word may be a substance, but is it eternal or non-eternal? Considering in this way is the principle of assumption. These four principles accepted in Nyaya Darshan are not different from any particular knowledge - they are special forms of knowledge, therefore accepting them separately is illogical.
Now the components are described. Promise, reason, example, application and conclusion - these are the five components. The indication of the object - telling the meaning of the object is the promise. For example, saying that the word is eternal and saying that the word is non-eternal is a promise. That which makes the meaning contained in the promise known - makes it independent, is called the reason, such as the word is non-eternal because being born is its nature, here the nature of the word being born is the reason.

---------------------------
The *Sutrakritanga Sutra* provides examples to illustrate similarity or dissimilarity. For example, a pot is an example of similarity. An example of dissimilarity is the sky, which is not impermanent and therefore not created. This is an example of how to conclude a point by stating that something is or is not like something else. For example, a word is impermanent because it is created. Just as a pot is created, so too is a word. If something is not impermanent, it is permanent and not created, like the sky. A word is not like the sky. 

The repetition of the proposition and reason is called *nigamana*. For example, "A word is impermanent because it is created." If these five components are merely words, they are *poudgalika* and are absorbed by the non-living. Therefore, it is not logical to consider them as separate substances. If the five components are considered to be the knowledge generated by the word, then it is a quality of the living being and is absorbed by the living being. If different types of knowledge are considered to be separate substances, then there will be an abundance of substances because there are many types of knowledge. 

After doubt, the perception of a substance is called *tarka*. For example, "There must be a post or a man here." *Tarka* is also a specific type of knowledge. Knowledge is inseparable from the knower. Therefore, it is not wise to consider its different aspects as separate substances. The definitive knowledge that comes after doubt and *tarka* is called *nirnaya*. This is also not different from previous knowledge. It is definitive. Therefore, it is included in the evidence of perception, etc. It is not logical to consider it as a separate substance. 

There are three types of stories: *vad*, *jalpa*, and *vitanda*. *Vad* is where one's own point is proven and the opponent's point is refuted using evidence and logic. It is consistent with principles, arises from the five components, and considers both sides. It takes place between a student and a teacher with the goal of understanding the truth. *Jalpa* is where one tries to win by using deception, caste, and suppression to support one's own side and refute the other side. *Vitanda* is where there is no establishment of the opponent's side. 

Jains say that these three types of stories are not proven. In the context of contemplating the truth, only *vad* should be used to determine the truth. Deception, *jalpa*, etc. do not lead to understanding. They are used to deceive others and do not lead to knowledge of the truth. Even if there are differences, their substantiality is not proven. It is logical to accept as a substance what is truly real. *Vad* is subject to human desire and therefore impermanent. Its substantiality is not proven. *Vad* is subject to human desire. It also occurs between chickens and doves, so it should also be accepted as a substance, which you do not want. 

In Nyaya philosophy, there are three types of fallacious reasons: *asiddha*, *anekantika*, and *viruddha*. Those that appear similar to reasons are called fallacious reasons. Here is the Jain perspective on this:

Page #565:
---------------------------
The study of Samvāsaraṇa, which is the correct and true reason, is not accepted as a principle. Then, how can Hetvābhāsa be considered a principle? Only that which is fixed and certain can be a principle, but reasons are related to a particular object and become non-reasons in relation to another object. Therefore, they are uncertain.

Now, the topic of deception arises. When there is a possibility of an alternative meaning, or when there is a difference in meaning, to distort the meaning of the speaker's statement, to kill its meaning, to change its meaning, is deception. When a speaker uses a word with a particular meaning, with a particular intention, to imagine a different meaning from his intended meaning is verbal deception. For example, a speaker says, "Nava kumbalo'yam Devadattaḥ," meaning Devadatta has a new blanket. Here, according to the speaker's intention, the analysis is "Nava kumbalo'sya," meaning his blanket is new. In this context, the difference or peculiarity lies in the analysis, not in the compound word. "Navaḥ kumbalo'sya," meaning he has nine blankets, is what the deceiver imagines. He says that Devadatta has nine blankets. You said this, but he doesn't have nine blankets. Therefore, your statement is not logical.

In this regard, the Jain view is that to state what is not true is deception. If it is deception, then it is not a principle. If it is a principle, then it is not deception. Because a principle is the ultimate truth. Therefore, to call deception a principle is illogical.

Dūṣaṇābhāsa, the appearance of a fault, is called a category. The Jains say that what is truly a fault is not established as a principle, it is not considered a principle because it is uncertain. What is well established as a fault in one place becomes Dūṣaṇābhāsa in another place. The establishment of Dūṣaṇa and Dūṣaṇābhāsa depends on the power and ability of the person. Therefore, it is uncertain. It is not a principle. Then, how can a category, which takes the form of Dūṣaṇābhāsa, be a principle, because they are unreal, they do not exist.

During a debate, the point where the speaker or the opponent is captured is called the point of capture. For example, if the speaker uses a statement that does not prove his intended meaning and the opponent captures its fault, then the speaker is captured, he is caught, this is the point of capture. In addition, other things stated in the Nyāya Darshan are mere talk. For example, प्रतिज्ञा, हानि, प्रतिज्ञान्तर, and प्रतिज्ञा विरोध, etc. If we think about it, this cannot be the point of capture. Even if it is called the point of capture, it is a mistake, a fault of the person. It cannot be a principle. The qualities and faults of the speaker are authorized only in the experience of the object. They are not established as principles. Thus, the principles stated in the Nyāya Darshan are not worthy of being considered as principles.

The principles established by those who believe in the Vaisheshika Darshan are also not worthy of being considered as principles. According to them, substance, quality, action, genus, species, and inherence are the six principles. Among these, earth, water, fire, air, space, time, direction, soul, and mind are the nine substances. To accept earth, water, fire, and air separately is inappropriate because they themselves, through the use of atoms and natural combination, become earth, etc. Therefore, they do not abandon their substance-hood, they only change their states.

Page #566:
---------------------------
The question is about the distinction between the **Shree Sutra Kritanga Sutra** and the **Dravya Bhed** (distinction of substances). It argues that considering **Dravya Bhed** is irrelevant. 

Jains accept **Aakash** (space) and **Kaal** (time) as substances. **Disha** (direction) is a component of **Aakash**, so it cannot be considered a separate substance. 

The **Atma** (soul) is pervasive and its characteristic is **Upayog** (use). Jains accept it as a substance. **Man** (mind) is a specific form of **Pudgal** (matter). Therefore, it is included in the **Pudgal Dravya** (matter substance) like an atom. **Bhav** (emotion) is a quality of the **Jeev** (living being) and is therefore inherent in the **Atma**.

**Vaisheshik** philosophers argue that **Prithvi** (earth) exists due to the presence of **Prithvitva** (earthness). This is just their interpretation. There is no separate entity called **Prithvitva** that creates **Prithvi Dravya** (earth substance).

Everything in the world is a combination of **Samaanya** (general) and **Vishesh** (specific). For example, **Narasimha** (half-man, half-lion) has the characteristics of both **Manav** (human) and **Singh** (lion). Therefore, a **Ghata** (pot) is not completely identical to **Mrittika** (clay) because there is a clear distinction between them. However, they are not completely different either because the **Ghata** contains **Mrittika**. Therefore, the **Ghata** is partially different and partially identical to **Mrittika**. It is a substance of a different category. Similarly, **Narasimha** is not just a **Manav** because it also has the form of a **Singh**. It is also not a **Singh** because it has the form of a **Manav**. Therefore, due to the difference in **Shabd** (word), **Vishesh Gyan** (specific knowledge), and **Kary** (function), **Narasimha** is a substance of a different category.

**Vaisheshiks** believe that **Roop** (form), **Ras** (taste), **Gandh** (smell), and **Sparsh** (touch) are qualities of **Roop-Moort Dravya** (concrete substances). **Sankhya** (number), **Pariman** (quantity), **Prithaktva** (separateness), **Sanyog** (combination), **Vibhag** (division), **Paratva** (externality), and **Aparatva** (internality) are general qualities because they are present in all substances. **Buddhi** (intellect), **Sukha** (happiness), **Dukha** (suffering), **Ichchha** (desire), **Dvesh** (hatred), **Prayatna** (effort), **Dharma** (righteousness), **Adharma** (unrighteousness), and **Sanskar** (impressions) are qualities of the **Atma**. **Prithvi** and **Udk** (water) have **Gurutva** (gravity). **Prithvi**, **Jal** (water), and **Tej** (fire) have **Dravyatva** (substance). **Sneha** (smoothness) is only present in **Jal**. **Veg** (speed) is a **Sanskar** present in concrete substances. **Shabd** is a quality of **Aakash**.

Jains argue that **Sankhya** etc., which are general qualities, are not inherent qualities of **Roop** etc., but are **Upaadhi** (attributes) of other things. Therefore, they are not qualities. Even if they are considered qualities, they cannot be separated from substances. If they are separated, the very nature of the substance will cease to exist. According to the **Tattvarth Sutra** (Chapter 5), a substance is that which has qualities and **Paryaya** (modifications). A substance cannot exist without qualities. Therefore, by accepting a substance, one accepts its qualities. This is logical. It is not necessary to consider them as separate entities.

"**Tasyabhavastatvam**" - The essence of a substance is its **Bhav** (nature), **Dharma** (characteristic), or **Swaroop** (form). The quality that allows a substance to have **Shabd** is called **Shabd** according to the **Tattvatatvou** Sutra. A **Ghata** is **Rakta** (red) in color. **Jal** is **Aaharaka** (nourishing). All substances that have these qualities are called **Ghata**. Here, the **Bhav** of **Ghata** is **Ghatatva**, the **Bhav** of **Rakta** is **Raktatva**, the **Bhav** of **Aahar** is **Aaharakatva**, and the **Bhav** of **Jalavan** is **Jalavatva**.

Page #567:
---------------------------
The study of the Samvasarana is being undertaken. Here, the relationship of the general from the gross to the specific from the subtle, of the blood quality from the blood essence, of the nourishing action from the nourishment, and of the water substance from the water quality is indicated. In the water vessel called Kutka, which is capable of holding the gross, round, and watery substance, the word "Ghata" is used. Therefore, the suffixes "tva" and "tal" are used with the word "Ghata" to indicate these qualities. To clarify this, a question is raised: "What is the quality called 'Rakt' that makes the pot 'Rakt'?" What is the substance that the word is inserted into, with which the भाव (भाव) suffix is used? Is it "Raktasyā bhāvo raktatvam" - the essence of blood - redness is raktatva - redness? This should be the case. In response, it is said: "It should be the case, but it can be so formally, because just as blood can be considered a substance formally, its general essence can be called raktatva. However, the element of formality has no use in the context of contemplation. The word's efficacy lies only in its means - its usefulness lies only in its being a means. The word is not a quality of space because the word is नौद्गलिक (naudgalik) - concrete, and space is अमूर्त (amurt) - abstract. The rest of the substances described in the Vaisheshika philosophy are merely explanations of its process. Therefore, they are neither instrumental in any purpose nor are they its corrupt form or obstacle. It is reasonable to assume that the action that resides in the substance through the relationship of समवाय (samavāya) is not a separate element like the quality. Now, let's discuss the general. According to the Vaisheshikas, there are two types of general: पर (para) and अपर (apara). The great power that pervades substances like dravya, etc., is called परसामान्य (parasamanya). It has been said: "The existence that is perceived in dravya, guna, and karma is that existence." Dravyatva, gunatva, and karmatva are अपर सामान्य (apara samanya). The Jains say that it is not reasonable to accept the great power as a separate substance because the existence that is perceived in that power is just like the perception of existence. Is it bound by another existence? Does it exist because of another, or does it exist on its own? If it is said that it exists because of the binding of another existence, then it will be a choice whether the perception of existence in this other existence comes from something else. This choice will continue further. Thus, the अनवस्था (anavastā) fault will arise. If you say that the perception of existence in the great power exists on its own, not from any other thing, then the perception of existence in dravya, etc., will exist on its own. Then, why should another existence be imagined, like the udder of a goat's neck, which is useless? The second point is this: you accept the perception of existence in dravya, etc., through existence, considering them to be existent, or do you consider them to be non-existent? If you consider them to be existent, then the perception of existence will be on its own. Then, what will be the need for existence for the perception of existence? If you accept the perception of existence in dravya, etc., through existence, considering them to be non-existent, then it is possible to perceive existence in the horns of a rabbit, etc., through the combination of existence. Therefore, it has been said: "Substances are themselves existent - their own existence is that which is सदात्मक (sadātmaka), what need do they have for existence? Substances that are असदात्मक (asadātmaka) - non-existent, do not have existence, and if they do, then it will also be relevant in the case of the horns of a rabbit, etc., which is अतिप्रसंग (atiprasanga) - irrelevant. The same faults that apply here in the context of the great power are also applicable in the case of dravyatva, etc., अपर सामान्य (apara samanya), because their existence is the same. We also accept things as general and specific from some perspective. The general is not different from dravya, therefore, it is also included in the acceptance of dravya. Now, the specifics are discussed. In the Vaisheshika philosophy, a substance called विशेष (visesha) is considered. The Vaisheshikas say that it is the विशेष (visesha) that is the reason for the extreme exclusion of knowledge in dravya, etc. - through it

---------------------------
The **Sri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states that a substance is identified by its distinctness from other substances. In this regard, we consider whether the special qualities that possess specific intelligence are dependent on any other special quality. If they are dependent on another special quality, it cannot be said so because this dependence will continue indefinitely, leading to the fallacy of infinite regress. Therefore, just as special qualities possess specific intelligence without other special qualities, similarly, specific intelligence can be attributed to substances like dravya (matter). Then why should a separate substance called "special quality" be considered besides dravya? We also accept that special qualities are not distinct from dravya, because all substances are generally characterized by special qualities. The Vaisheshika school believes that special qualities are eternal and reside in dravya, and they are also final, residing in everything. There are four types of eternal dravya: atoms, liberated souls, and liberated minds. Special qualities exist in these. This statement is arbitrary, illogical, and incomprehensible. It is merely an explanation given by them. In Vaisheshika philosophy, a substance called "samavaya" (inherence) is considered. It is said that "samavaya" is the cause of perception in substances that are mutually dependent and inseparable. It is eternal and one. Considering it eternal would make all the inherents eternal. If the inherents are considered non-eternal, then "samavaya" would also be non-eternal because the inherents are its basis. Due to the oneness of "samavaya," all inherents would be considered one, which would create a difficulty. If the inherents are considered many, then "samavaya" would also be many.

In Vaisheshika philosophy, "samavaya" is accepted as a relation. Relation is dualistic, existing in two. Therefore, due to the difference between a stick and the one holding the stick, the substances that are its basis are considered to be mutually dependent and not independent. When a mat is created from long grass, the form of the grass is destroyed and the form of the mat is produced. This is similar to the transformation of milk into curd. Thus, the arrangement of substances accepted by Vaisheshika philosophy is not properly established.

Now, the principles of Sankhya philosophy are presented. According to Sankhya philosophy, creation arises from the union of prakriti (nature) and atma (soul) or purusha (consciousness). The state of equilibrium of sattva guna (quality of goodness), rajo guna (quality of passion), and tamo guna (quality of darkness) is called prakriti. From prakriti, mahat (intellect) is produced. From mahat, ahamkara (ego) is produced, and from ahamkara, eleven senses and five tanmatras (subtle elements) are produced. From the five tanmatras, five mahabhutas (gross elements) are produced. The nature of purusha-atma is consciousness. It is not an agent, it is devoid of qualities, and it is the experiencer. According to Jain philosophy, sattva and other qualities, which are mutually contradictory, are inherent in prakriti and cannot exist together without a regulating quality. Just as black and white colors cannot exist together without a regulator, similarly, mahat and other modifications cannot be produced from prakriti without a cause for the production of heterogeneity. Therefore, in Sankhya philosophy, there is no cause for the production of heterogeneity in prakriti. Hence, nothing other than itself can be produced from prakriti, and heterogeneity cannot arise. Due to the non-agency of the soul, it is incapable of doing anything. If it is assumed that there is inherent heterogeneity in prakriti, then it would be without a cause. In such a situation, sattva-substance would either be eternal or non-eternal. It is said that if heterogeneity is accepted to arise in prakriti without any other cause, then all substances would be either real or unreal because substances are real or unreal depending on the cause. Mahat and ahamkara are not different from sensation because the knowledge "I am happy," "I am unhappy" is the same as intellect, determination, or ego. Intellect and ego are attributes of the soul because they are like holes. They are not modifications of inert prakriti.

The Samvāsaraṇa studies have not been done. It is believed that the Bhūtas are born from the Tanmātrās. Just as the Earth is born from the Gandha Tanmātrā, water from the Rasa Tanmātrā, fire from the Rūpa Tanmātrā, air from the Sparśa Tanmātrā, and space from the Śabda Tanmātrā. This belief of the Sāṃkhya philosophy is illogical because if you say that it is based on external Bhūtas, then it is not correct because they have always existed. It is not true that this whole world has never been like this before - it has been different. If you say that the Bhūtas residing in each body are born from the five Tanmātrās, then this is also not true. Because there are skin and bones in the body. They are hard and are part of the Earth, and phlegm, mucus, and blood are liquid forms of water, then fire digests food. Prāṇa and Apāna are air. The empty space in the body is space. It is also not correct to believe that such a body is born from Tanmātrās. Because some bodies are born from semen and blood. Therefore, the smell of Tanmātrās is not even perceived in them. It is irrelevant to imagine something that is unseen - not visible as a cause. It is also observed that eggs, plants, sprouts, etc. are born from something else. Therefore, the creation that the Sāṃkhya philosophers describe according to their process - the order of creation, from Pradhāna to Mahat and from Mahat to Ahamkāra, etc., is illogical. They say this because they are attached to their doctrines. Accepting the Akṛtitva of the soul leads to the fault of Kṛta Nāśa and Akṛtābhyāgama. This also results in the absence of bondage and liberation. Accepting the Nirguṇatva of the soul leads to the objection that it is devoid of knowledge - it is proven to be ignorant. Thus, the doctrine of the Sāṃkhya philosophers is like the babbling of a child - it is meaningless. Prakṛti is unconscious - devoid of consciousness. It is inclined towards the soul. This statement is also illogical.

Now the Buddhist doctrine is described - there, matter is accepted in the form of twelve Āyatanas. Like the five senses, such as eyes, etc., the five sense objects, such as form, etc., Śabda Āyatana and Dharma Āyatana. Sukhādi is called Dharma. The delimitation - determination of these twelve Āyatanas is through direct perception and inference - these two proofs. In this context, the Jains say that the senses like eyes, etc., have been taken by us from the Ajiva. Bhāvendriya is taken from the perception of the Jiva. The objects like form, etc., have also been taken from the Ajiva. Therefore, they should not be considered separate. Śabda is Paudgalik. Therefore, Śabda Āyatana also comes under the Ajiva from its perception. Therefore, it is not logical to accept each one as a separate substance. Sukha and Duḥkha, which are called Dharma Āyatana. If they are in the form of the rise of Sātavedaniya and Asātavedaniya, then they are the qualities of the Jiva. Therefore, they are included in the Jiva itself. If they are the cause - the form of Sukha Duḥkha, Karma, then being Paudgalik, they come under the Ajiva. Buddhists call direct perception Nirvikalpaka. Nirvikalpaka is in the form of uncertainty. Therefore, it is not a part or cause of inclination and disinclination. Its authenticity - being a proof is not proven. In this way, if direct perception is not authentic, then inference cannot be a proof either because it is based on direct perception. The avoidance of other objections - accusations has been considered thoughtfully elsewhere, therefore, they are not being refuted in detail here. One should refute the principles stated - propounded in the Mīmāṃsaka and Lokāyata Cārvāka philosophies with one's own intellect. They accept very worldly-opposed substances. Therefore, they have not been presented here directly. In this way, the nine or seven substances remaining from all these - the separate Tīrthaṅkara, are the only truths. Their knowledge is the cause in Kriyāvāda. The knowledge of the substances accepted by other doctrines is not the cause in Kriyāvāda.

He who is not attached to sounds and forms, who does not dislike smells and tastes, who does not desire life nor death, who is free from the fetters of *āyāna* and *gupta*, I say, is liberated.

##  The Study of Truth
### Thirteenth Chapter of the Study of Truth

I will reveal the nature of knowledge, born in a man. I will reveal the true Dharma, the true conduct, peace and unrest.  ||1||

**Commentary:** This sutra is connected to the previous one, which states that the virtuous are free from the cycle of illusion. Here, the cycle of illusion is attachment and aversion. Only those who are free from these attain the truth. This sutra explains this connection. 

The true nature of things is called truth. This truth is the ultimate reality. Contemplating this ultimate reality leads to right knowledge and so on. The sutra-author reveals this, saying "the nature of knowledge." The word "nature" refers to the primary meaning. The word "primary" includes right faith and right conduct. Right faith includes the stages of the path: the initial, the intermediate, and the final. Right conduct includes the observance of vows, the protection of the community, and the control of passions. 

I will reveal this right knowledge, which is born in a man. The word "tu" emphasizes that I will reveal the flaws of those who are deceitful and those who are not virtuous. I will reveal the diverse nature of man, both the good and the bad. 

I will reveal the diverse nature and the consequences. I will reveal the Dharma of the virtuous, those who are well-behaved, those who have right faith and right conduct. I will reveal their conduct, which is characterized by the avoidance of the paths to hell. I will reveal their conduct, which is characterized by their noble behavior. I will reveal their peace, which is characterized by the cessation of all actions. 

I will also reveal the Adharma of the non-virtuous, those who are not well-behaved, those who are householders or those who are not Jain. I will reveal their conduct, which is characterized by sin. I will reveal their conduct, which is characterized by their evil behavior. I will reveal their unrest, which is characterized by the cycle of rebirth. 

Here, the arrangement of the words is such that I will reveal the Dharma, conduct, and peace of the virtuous, and the Adharma, evil conduct, and unrest of the non-virtuous. The word "cha" (and) is used to emphasize the contrast. ||1||

Page #572:
---------------------------
The *Sutrakritanga Sutra* is used here in the sense of an epithet. It indicates that I will also reveal the faults of those who are *vitathachari* - those who have false or contrary conduct. The nature of men is of various kinds - diverse. It is both high and praiseworthy, as well as low and unpraiseworthy. I will explain it. The nature of men and its fruits are of different kinds. This is explained in the latter half of this verse. Those who are *sattvik*, who have noble and pure conduct, and who are endowed with *samyakdarshan*, *samyakgyan*, and *samyakcharitra*, and who properly observe the *shruta charitra* dharma, which is an obstacle to going to hell, as a result of which they attain peace due to the depletion of all karmas, I will explain about them. I will discuss the *adharma* - sin, the evil conduct, and the unrest that causes wandering in the world of those who are *asat* - those who do not have good conduct, those who are of other faiths, householders, and *parshvastha* etc. Here, I will expound the *dharma*, good conduct, and peace of the good man, and I will expound the *adharma* - bad conduct, and unrest of the bad man. Thus, the word should be used. In this verse, what is not said should be understood by the word 'cha'.
"Oh, those who have risen in the day and night, having obtained the *dharma* from the *tathagatas*, they speak harshly to the *shastras* in this way, saying that they are not interested in *samadhi*."
**Commentary:** The author of the sutra has previously stated that I will narrate the nature of beings, which is of various kinds in terms of qualities, defects, etc. He reveals this through this verse: Those who are engaged in the proper conduct of *samyak* in day and night, who have obtained the *shruta charitra* dharma, which is the means of crossing the world, from the *shruta* people and the *tirthankaras*, even after obtaining it, due to their karma and bad luck, *jamali* etc. do not follow the *samadhi* - the path to liberation - which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. here in this world. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc. They do not follow the path of liberation, which is explained by the *tirthankaras* etc

Page #573:
---------------------------
Those who do not accept the path to liberation based on right faith, as formulated by the omniscient, due to their ego or prejudice, and who, out of their own interest, destroy the faultless path to liberation propounded by the omniscient, based on the principles formulated by the Nihnath and Digambar, and formulate a wrong path, are wrong. They say that one who calls an action that is being performed as done, is directly contradicting the formulation, and is not omniscient. One who, while holding possessions like vessels, etc., still describes the attainment of liberation, cannot be omniscient. Thus, they do not have faith in the principles that describe liberation in the path to liberation as spoken by the omniscient. There are many who, while having faith in the principles taught by the omniscient, are not able to bear the burden of the restraints, which are accepted as they are, due to weakness in fortitude, patience, endurance, physical condition, etc., and are not able to maintain the restraints. There are many who become disheartened, slack, or unstable in observing the restraints, and even when they are encouraged to observe the restraints with affection by the Acharya, etc., they speak harsh, rough, or cruel words to those who give advice or discipline.

"They speak falsely, those who are engrossed in their own self-interest. Those who speak falsely out of doubt about knowledge, become unworthy of many virtues." (3)

**Commentary:**

Even though the path formulated by the Vitaraga is purified and free from all faults, they, the Nihnath, speak falsely about its faults - they accuse it of faults. They follow a tradition that suits their own interests. They engage in discussions and arguments that are different from the right view, which they have received from tradition. They are unworthy of the best qualities.

**Explanation:**

The purified path to liberation, which is free from faults, is formulated by the omniscient, and is based on right faith, knowledge, and conduct. This path is purified by removing the formulation of the wrong path through various means. The group of people who are obsessed with their own interests, speak falsely about this path, following the formulation of the Acharya. Those who are deluded by their own self-interest and the way they interpret the scriptures, and who misinterpret the meaning of the scriptures, even though they have been received from the Acharya's tradition, are engrossed in their own self-interest. They are unable to properly understand the deep meaning of the scriptures, the meaning of karma, and the consequences of actions, and they present a superficial understanding. This shows that interpreting the scriptures based on one's own self-interest leads to great harm. Such a person, due to his own attachment, becomes unworthy of many virtues, such as knowledge. These virtues are:

"He serves, he asks questions, he listens, he accepts, he desires. He then rejects, or he maintains, or he acts correctly." (1)

If one attains right knowledge through serving the Guru, etc., then one follows the right conduct, and then one attains liberation, which is characterized by the destruction of all karma. Such a person becomes unworthy of these virtues. Some readings say "They become unworthy of many attachments." The meaning of this is that such a person becomes unworthy of right knowledge, etc., because he is attached to many things that are harmful.

Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra
Translation:

Those who are disfigured by ignorance, who are smeared with a little knowledge or learning, and who have doubts about scriptural knowledge (shrutajnana) and knowledge (jnana), and who speak falsehoods - they cast doubt on the scriptures revealed by the Omniscient (Sarvajna). They say that this (scripture) is not composed by the Omniscient, or that its meaning is different. Or out of the pride of their scholarship, they speak falsehoods, saying that what I say is alone correct, and not otherwise.

Those who, when questioned, twist (the meaning) and truly deceive (the questioner) regarding the true purport - they, though appearing as ascetics here, are in fact deceitful and will go to endless destruction.

Page #575:
---------------------------
**Sri Yatathayadhyayana Anuvada - Those who hide their Guru's name when asked, deprive themselves of Moksha. They are truly Asadhu, but consider themselves Sadhu. These Maya-anvit, deceitful, or boastful men experience the suffering of the world countless times.**

**Tika - Some, who do not know the true meaning of things, become arrogant with a little knowledge. When asked by others, "From which Acharya did you learn and hear this?", they hide their own Acharya's name out of pride in their knowledge. They may say, "I have discovered this myself," or "I have learned this from a famous Acharya," thus hiding their Guru's name. Or, if they have made a mistake or forgotten something, they may hide the truth out of fear of being criticized by their Acharya, just like a child hides the truth from its mother out of fear of being scolded. Such men, who hide their Guru's name, deprive themselves of knowledge, Moksha, and its purpose. The word "Khalu" here means certainty, so they definitely deprive themselves. Such men are truly Asadhu, but they boast of being Sadhu in this world. They are Maya-anvit, deceitful, and not truly Sadhu. They will experience destruction countless times and wander in the dense forest of Samsara. They are guilty of two faults: they are themselves Asadhu, and they boast of being Sadhu. It is said, "One who commits a sin and claims to be pure, commits double the sin. This is the second foolishness of a child." Thus, by their pride, they destroy their own understanding and become subject to endless Samsara. This is the truth.**

**The author now explains the consequences of pride and introduces the faults of Kshaya like anger, etc.**

**Śrī Sūtrakrtaṅga Sūtra**

Whoever is a **krodhano** (prone to anger), a **jagadarthabhāṣī** (one who speaks about the faults of others), and **udirāyeja** (rekindles extinguished conflict), is a **papakarmā** (doer of evil deeds). He dwells in the **daṇḍapatha** (narrow path) like a blind man, and suffers.

**Commentary:**

A person who is **krodhano** by nature, due to the **vipaka** (result) of **kaṣāya** (passions), and who is also a **jagadarthabhāṣī**, speaks about the faults of others. For example, he might call a Brahmin a **ḍoda** (fool), a merchant a **kirāṭa** (barbarian), a **śūdra** an **ābhira** (herdsman), a **śvapāka** a **caṇḍāla** (outcast), a blind person **kāṇa**, a lame person **khaja**, a hunchback **kubja**, a deaf person **vau bham**, a leper **kuṣṭhina**, a consumptive **kṣayina**, etc. He speaks harshly and rudely about the faults of others. He is called a **jagadarthabhāṣī** because he speaks about the faults of the world. Or, he might be a **jayarthabhāṣī** (one who speaks for victory), who speaks falsely to achieve victory. He wants to win by any means, even by speaking untruthfully.

**Viyosiyam** means to rekindle extinguished conflict. He rekindles the **dvandva** (dualism) and **kalaha** (conflict) that has been settled. This is like when people who have been fighting and have apologized to each other, but then someone says something that makes them angry again.

The sūtra then describes the **vipaka** (result) of this action. Just as a blind man, who is **daṇḍapatha** (on a narrow path), stumbles and falls because he cannot see, so too does this person, who is **aviosie** (unreconciled) and **papakarmā** (doer of evil deeds), suffer in the **caturgaṭika** (four realms of existence) due to his **karma** (actions). He is constantly tormented in the **yātanāsthāna** (places of torment).

**Commentary on the Commentary:**

A person who is not aware of the **vipaka** of **kaṣāya** and who is **krodhano** by nature, speaks harshly about the faults of others. He speaks about the world as it is, without any filter. He is called a **jagadarthabhāṣī** because he speaks about the faults of the world. Or, he might be a **jayarthabhāṣī** (one who speaks for victory), who speaks falsely to achieve victory. He wants to win by any means, even by speaking untruthfully.

He rekindles extinguished conflict. This is like when people who have been fighting and have apologized to each other, but then someone says something that makes them angry again.

The sūtra then describes the **vipaka** (result) of this action. Just as a blind man, who is **daṇḍapatha** (on a narrow path), stumbles and falls because he cannot see, so too does this person, who is **aviosie** (unreconciled) and **papakarmā** (doer of evil deeds), suffer in the **caturgaṭika** (four realms of existence) due to his **karma** (actions). He is constantly tormented in the **yātanāsthāna** (places of torment).

The one who engages in strife and speaks unjustly, does not attain samatva - he does not develop equanimity. He does not become free from afflictions. The one who follows the Guru's instructions, is ashamed of committing sins, and has faith in the principles, is free from maya (illusion).

##  The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Verse 7:**

He who, even when instructed, remains unperturbed in his mind when faults arise, and is taught by the Acharya and others, is **pesal**, endowed with humility and other virtues, a seer of subtle meaning, and a hero of the self. He is a noble soul, observing restraint, and imbued with equanimity and **ujjuchare** - straightforward conduct.

**Verse 8:**

He who, with little wisdom, considers himself wise, is like a conch shell, empty and hollow. He is like a fool who, clinging to his own opinion, sees the world as a mere reflection.

The knowledge that is attained through the study of the Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra is called "Jnana Sankhya". A tapasvi who considers himself to be a knower of this knowledge, but does not properly examine the ultimate truth, becomes arrogant and proud. He sees other sadhus and righteous householders as mere appearances, like reflections in water or counterfeit coins, and he despises them. He also attributes qualities like caste to himself, considering himself to be superior, and looks down upon others. Such a person is devoid of wisdom.

"Kuta" is like a snare or trap, which binds animals like deer and makes them subservient. Similarly, a sadhu who is bound by the snare of affection and attachment wanders in the cycle of samsara. He becomes deeply engrossed in the world and keeps getting reborn and dying, trapped in the cycle of birth and death. The word "tu" here indicates that he is deluded by desires and attachments and is immersed in the painful world.

The arrogant person mentioned earlier does not follow the path of "Moun" (silence) in his life. The conduct or dharma associated with monks is called "Moun". Its place or position is "Samyam" (self-control). Alternatively, the path established by the omniscient "Mounindra" is called "Mounindra Pad". He does not follow this path.

The characteristics of the omniscient are described as follows: One who protects the "Go-vani" (true speech) by speaking truthfully and consistently, without contradicting himself, is called "Gotr". The omniscient's teachings are the "Gotr", the foundation of all scriptures. Alternatively, one who is born into a high caste and takes pride in it does not follow the path of the omniscient. One who seeks honor, respect, and praise, and becomes proud upon receiving them, is also not on the path of the omniscient.

"Vas" means wealth or material possessions. Here, it refers to "Samyam" (self-control). One who possesses "Samyam" but is engrossed in pride due to knowledge and other such qualities, and does not understand the ultimate truth, is deluded. Even though he may read all the scriptures and understand their meaning, he does not truly understand the teachings of the omniscient.

"A Brahmin, a Kshatriya, an Ugraputra, or a Lichchhavi, who has renounced the world and accepts food given by others, and does not take pride in his high lineage, follows the path of the omniscient."

**Commentary:**

The text explains that pride arises from various sources, including caste pride. It emphasizes that a person who is truly on the path of the omniscient does not consider himself superior based on his birth or lineage. The examples of Brahmin, Kshatriya, Ugraputra, and Lichchhavi are given to illustrate that a person's caste does not determine his spiritual progress. The text highlights that true spiritual growth comes from renouncing worldly attachments and following the path of self-control and wisdom.

## The Study of the Path

"The renunciate," having abandoned the bonds of kingdom and home, is one who partakes of what is given by others - a partaker of food given by others, a practitioner of perfect restraint. Even though born in a high lineage, in a lineage like the Harivaṃśa, he should not entertain pride, the 'pillar' of pride. In what kind of lineage? - In a lineage bound by pride, a source of pride. This is what is said: Even though he is worthy of respect by all people due to his special lineage, how can a renunciate, having shaved his head and beard, wandering from house to house for alms, entertain pride, which is laughable? He should not entertain pride at all. This is the meaning. ||10||

**Commentary:** Among all the sources of pride, pride in one's lineage is the most prominent. Because it is not based on external causes, it arises simply from birth. Therefore, the sutra-kāra emphasizes it, saying: The man who is born in the Brāhmaṇa lineage, in the Ikshvāku dynasty, in the noble lineage of the Ugrakula, the Lichchhavi, or other Kshatriya lineages, having been born in such a special lineage, understands the true nature of the world, recognizes the kingdom and other things as causes of bondage, and renounces them, becoming a renunciate. He partakes of food and other things given by others. He practices pure restraint. Even though born in a high lineage like the Harivaṃśa, he should not entertain pride, the 'pillar' of pride. In what kind of lineage? Explaining this, he says: In a lineage that is bound by pride, or is a source of pride, a cause for generating pride. The meaning is this: Because of being born in a special lineage, he who was worthy of respect by all people, having become a renunciate, shaved his head and beard, accepting the path of a renunciate, when he goes to other people's houses for alms, why should he be proud? Doing so is laughable for him. The meaning is that he should never entertain pride.

Neither his lineage nor his family can protect him, nor can any other well-refined knowledge and conduct. Having renounced, he serves the duties of a householder, he does not become a transmigrant for liberation. ||11||

**Shadow:** Neither his lineage nor his family can protect him, nor can any other well-refined knowledge and conduct. Having renounced, he serves the duties of a householder, he does not become a transmigrant for liberation.

**Translation:** Lineage and family cannot protect a person from misfortune. They cannot save him from it. Apart from well-refined knowledge and conduct, nothing else can save a person from misfortune and suffering. The man who, having renounced, having been initiated, still serves the duties of a householder, does not become capable of liberating his actions, of diminishing them.

**Commentary:** He does not entertain pride, because it is not conducive to virtue. This is what is shown: For a person of low nature, who is agitated by pride, neither pride in lineage nor pride in family, while wandering in the world, can be a protection. For pride in lineage, etc., is not beneficial for worldly or otherworldly virtues. Here, lineage is born from the mother, family is born from the father. This is also a characteristic. There is no other source of pride that can protect from the world. What is capable of protecting, of being a means of liberation from the world, is shown: Knowledge and conduct, knowledge and conduct. Apart from this, there is no hope of liberation from the world. This, being strengthened by right faith, well-refined, liberates from the world. "Liberation is through knowledge and action," according to the saying. Even though such a person is on the path of liberation, even though he has taken renunciation, if he is of weak virtue, he is inclined towards the world, he "serves" the duties of householders, he practices them, he performs them repeatedly, he makes the source of pride in lineage, etc., a part of the duties of householders. Another reading is "agārikarma," the duties of householders, he practices them, he performs them, he makes the source of pride in lineage, etc., a part of them. He who serves the duties of householders does not become a transmigrant for the liberation of all actions, he does not become a destroyer of all actions. This is the meaning. Liberation from the world, however, arises for all those who are well-intentioned, every moment. ||11||

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra
## Commentary

**Meaning:** Pride does not arise from virtue, nor does it bring any benefit. The Sutrakar (author of the sutra) points out that a man of low nature and base character, who becomes arrogant and tyrannical due to pride, cannot be saved from the cycle of birth and death by his lineage or family pride. It cannot protect him. It does not benefit him in this world or the next. Lineage is "matrisamuttha" - born from the mother, and family is "pitrisamuttha" - born from the father. Here, lineage and family are merely signs. This indicates that other forms of pride are also incapable of saving one from the cycle of birth and death.

The Sutrakar points out what can truly save one from the cycle of birth and death: knowledge and conduct. There is no hope of liberation from the cycle of birth and death through anything else. When knowledge and conduct are strengthened, embraced, and cultivated through right faith, they liberate one from the cycle of birth and death. It is said that liberation is attained through knowledge and action.

Even so, a man who is not firmly rooted in Dharma (righteousness), who is attached to the world, and who, even after renouncing the world, continues to indulge in pride associated with lineage and other worldly things, or who engages in "agarikamma" (according to this interpretation, the practice of sinful karma), or who indulges in pride of lineage, cannot be liberated from all his karmas. Liberation from the world (deshmochan) - the partial destruction of karmas - happens to almost all beings every moment.

**Sutra:**

- णिक्किंचणे भिक्खू सुलूहजीवी, जे गारवं होइ सलोगगामी । आजीवमेयं तु अबुज्झमाणो, पुणो पुणो विप्परियासुवेंति ॥११॥

**Translation:**

- A monk who is devoid of possessions (nikkinchana), who lives on simple food (surukshajivi), and who is proud (garava) and seeks worldly praise (salogagami), is ignorant of the true nature of his livelihood (ajivameyam). He repeatedly falls into the cycle of birth and death (vippariyasuventi).

**Commentary:**

The commentary further explains the emergence of the fault of pride: Even though a monk is devoid of external possessions (nikkinchana) and follows the rules of begging for food (bhikshana shila), and lives on simple food (surukshajivi), if he is proud (gauravapriya) and seeks praise (shlokakami), he is ignorant of the true meaning of life (paramartham abudhyamana). He considers his simple life (surukshajivi) and his lack of possessions (nikkinchana) as means to achieve worldly praise (ajivam). He continues to fall into the cycle of birth, death, old age, disease, sorrow, and suffering (vippariyasam). He strives to overcome these things, but only sinks deeper into them. This is the cycle of birth and death (vippariyas).

**Meaning:**

The Sutrakar explains the faults of pride. A man who does not possess any external material possessions (akinchana), who earns his livelihood by accepting alms from others, who lives on simple food (antpraant), and who, despite this, is proud (gauravapriya) and seeks praise (shlokakami), is ignorant of the true meaning of life (paramartham abudhyamana). He considers his simple life (surukshajivi) and his lack of possessions (nikkinchana) as means to achieve worldly praise (ajivam). He continues to fall into the cycle of birth, death, old age, disease, sorrow, and suffering (vippariyasam). He strives to overcome these things, but only sinks deeper into them. This is the cycle of birth and death (vippariyas).

If someone is seeking fame and self-praise, then they do not know the ultimate truth. Their life is sustained by the means of renunciation, non-possession, and simple, dry food. These become mere means of livelihood, self-sustenance, or survival. Therefore, they are repeatedly born, grow old, die, suffer illness, grief, and other afflictions in this world, which is like a vast, dense forest. Even though they are eager to transcend the world, they become immersed in it and drown. This becomes a contradiction.

Those who are learned but do not practice the pure path of Samadhi and liberation should learn and understand how to eliminate these faults.

A monk who speaks well, is virtuous, and has insight is wise and learned. He who has profound wisdom and a pure heart will surpass others with his wisdom.

Commentary: A monk who is skilled in the art of language, speaks well, and is virtuous, is a true sage. He who speaks in a way that is good, beautiful, beneficial, moderate, and pleasing, is a virtuous speaker. This means that he speaks like milk and honey. He who has insight, has the qualities of intellect, understanding, and wisdom. He is able to respond immediately to any accusation or criticism. He is also knowledgeable and able to explain various aspects of the Dharma. He who has profound wisdom, has a deep understanding of the ultimate truth and is devoted to it. He who has a pure heart, is filled with the essence of Dharma. Such a monk is truly virtuous. However, if he becomes arrogant because of these qualities, such as thinking, "I am the only one who knows the art of language, I am the only one who is virtuous, there is no one like me who has insight, no one is as knowledgeable as I am in the scriptures, no one has profound wisdom, and no one has a pure heart," then he is not truly virtuous. Such a person will despise others with his wisdom. For what good is a person who is arrogant, stubborn, and full of pride? Such a person will not be able to participate in any gathering or discussion of the Dharma. Therefore, he should be humble and avoid arrogance. As it is said:

"Those who are arrogant and boastful about their own achievements will eventually be consumed by their own pride."

Here is the English translation, preserving the Jain terms:

The Shri Sutrakritanga Sutra states, who is this person in the context of the Dharma discourse? What is he like? In which particular deity does he have faith? In which philosophy does he believe? Knowing his imminent brilliance and quick intellect, he speaks, gives instructions, and is capable of grasping, assimilating, and understanding substances, or is adept at expounding various principles, and with the word 'cha' he comprehends the intention of the listener, whose intellect is immersed in the supreme truth, whose heart is imbued with the sentiment of Dharma, such a Sadhu is excellent and praiseworthy due to these true qualities of speech, etc. However, the Sadhu who takes pride in these qualities that are the cause of his Nirjara (spiritual purification) - "I am the knower of the science of speech, I am the best orator, there is no other as talented as me, no one else is as proficient in the esoteric scriptures as I am, and I alone have an intellect that has delved deep into the investigation of the principles" - such a self-aggrandizing person, through his intellect, belittles and disrespects others. As if in an assembly, during the discourse on Dharma, this person, with his stammering, sluggish, and empty speech, like cotton placed in a pot, what business does he have here, one might say. In this way, he considers himself as arrogant and haughty. Therefore, it is said - the person who, having diligently learned some scriptures or subjects created by others, proudly thinks that the entire body of literature and all the scriptures are just this much, and no more, he is like the monk who exalts himself, or the one who is intoxicated by gains, who criticizes another person of inferior intellect.

## Translation:

**Commentary on the Sutra:**

The Sutra-maker, while explaining the consequences of the fault mentioned earlier, says: "One who, by belittling others (paraparivhava) and displaying his own excellence (atmotkarsha), acts in the manner described earlier (ananta-rokt), even though he is proficient in the meaning of all scriptures and deeply knowledgeable in the essence of knowledge (tattva-gyan), does not attain the path of liberation (moksha-marg) through knowledge, vision, and character, or the path of Dharma-dhyan. He merely floats (plavan) on the surface of the ocean of ultimate reality (paramarth-rupi samudra). Who is such a man? The Sutra-maker provides insight: "The man who, due to not knowing the ultimate truth (paramarth), considers himself superior in knowledge and takes pride in his intellect, does not attain the path of samadhi and liberation." This is connected to the previous explanation.

The Sutra-maker now begins the second section of the text, saying: "The word 'ahva' (or) used in the verse signifies a shift in perspective (pakshanta). A man who has few obstacles (alpa-antaraya), possesses special powers and yogic abilities (labdhiman), and is capable of creating tools and resources for himself and others (upakarna), but is of a low nature (laghu-prakriti), becomes intoxicated with pride due to his gains (avalipta-garv-uddhta). Such a person does not attain samadhi. A man who is devoid of gains (labdhi-rahita) due to the rise of karma (karm-oday) criticizes and belittles others, saying: "No one is equal to me in creating and establishing tools and resources for the common good (sarva-sadharan hetu shayya-sanstarak). Others are merely busy filling their bellies like crows (kauva). So what is their purpose here?" In this way, he criticizes and belittles others who are foolish (bal-pragya).

**Verse 15:**

"Pannamayam cha eva tav-omayam cha, ninn-amaye go-y-amayam cha bhikkhu. Aajiv-agam cha eva chauth-thamaahu, se pandie uttam-poggale se."

**Shadow:**

"Pragya-mad-ancha eva tapo-mad-ancha, nir-namaye-d gotr-amad-ancha bhikkhu. Aajiv-agam cha eva chauth-thamaahu, sa pandi-t uttam-pudgale sa."

**Translation:**

"A monk should not be proud of his knowledge, his practice of austerities, his lineage, or his livelihood. He who is wise (pandi-t) and pure of soul (uttam-pudgale) is free from such pride."

**Commentary:**

"Thus, when a man, intoxicated with pride in his knowledge, criticizes others, he appears foolish. Therefore, a virtuous person should not be proud of his knowledge. Not only pride in knowledge, but also any other form of pride should be avoided by one who desires to conquer the world. To show this, the Sutra says: "One should not be proud of his knowledge (pragya-mad), his practice of austerities (tapo-mad), or his lineage (gotr-amad). One should not be proud of his knowledge, thinking, 'I am the only one who knows the true meaning of the scriptures,' or of his austerities, thinking, 'I am the only one who practices austerities in the right way, and I never become weary of them.' Similarly, one should not be proud of his lineage, thinking, 'I am born of a noble lineage like the Ikshvaku or Hari-vamsa.' One should also not be proud of his livelihood (aajiv-agam), thinking, 'I am the only one who has accumulated wealth.' The word 'cha' (and) indicates that one should not be proud of any other form of pride. He who is free from such pride is a 'pandi-t' (wise) and a 'uttam-pudgale' (pure of soul). The word 'pudgale' refers to the soul, and the word 'uttam' means 'the best.' Therefore, the meaning is: 'He is the best of the best, even greater than the greatest.'"

## The Sutra of the Sutra-Kritanga

**This is not for me, but for those who desire to cross the ocean of existence, they should not indulge in other types of pride.**  They should not indulge in other types of pride or arrogance. The Sutra-kara, guiding us, says: The pride that arises from a sharp intellect is called **Prajna-mada**. The virtuous should abandon **Prajna-mada** and **Tapa-mada** - they should eradicate them.  Meaning, "I alone am the true knower of the meaning and secrets of the scriptures." "I alone am the practitioner of the highest austerities." The virtuous should not be proud of their austerities, nor should they be weary or disheartened by them.  "I am born into the noble lineage of the Ikshvaku dynasty, the Hari dynasty, etc."  They should also eradicate this **Gautr-mada** (pride in lineage).  **Ajiva** is that by which a being lives, sustains itself. It is the accumulation of wealth, the collection of objects, the tools and means for living. The virtuous should not be proud of these either. The word "cha" used here indicates that the virtuous should also avoid other types of pride.  Only by abandoning pride can one become a learned, wise person.  They become a pure soul, a renunciator, an abandoner of all pride.  The word "pudgala" is the main word here.  It means that such a person is the best of the best, the greatest of the great, greater than the great.

**Those who are wise, do not indulge in these, nor do they serve them, those who are virtuous and wise.** They have transcended all lineages, they are great sages, they go to the highest, lineage-less state. (16)

**Commentary:**  These wise men, having understood the nature of these pride-inducing states, should separate them from themselves, abandon them.  Those who are wise and virtuous, those who are established in the knowledge of dharma, in the practice of dharma, do not indulge in pride of lineage, etc.  Who are these?  Those who are wise and virtuous, those who are established in the knowledge of dharma, in the practice of dharma, do not indulge in pride of lineage, etc.  Who are these?

**The one who has abandoned the study of the scriptures, who has destroyed sins through specific austerities, who is free from pride arising from noble lineage, etc., attains the highest and supreme liberation.** The word 'cha' indicates that they are born in the five great celestial realms or the timeless gods. The term 'agotra' signifies that there is no name, karma, lifespan, etc., in the path of liberation. This should be understood.

**The monk, being thus endowed with excellent luster and having seen the Dharma, enters villages and cities.** He, knowing what is desirable and what is undesirable, does not indulge in food and drink.

**Translation:** The virtuous monk, endowed with excellent luster and a knower of the Dharma, enters villages or cities, considering what is desirable and undesirable, remaining vigilant, and not indulging in food and drink, accepting pure alms.

**Commentary:** Such a monk, free from pride, is a practitioner of the vow of begging. He is called 'mritarch' because his body, devoid of rituals like bathing, applying sandalwood paste, etc., is like a corpse. Or, he is called 'mudarch' because he has beautiful and auspicious 'archa' (body) with lotus-like luster. He is endowed with excellent luster. He knows the Dharma, which is based on scriptures and conduct. Such a monk, entering villages, cities, or settlements like 'mandamb' for alms, is endowed with excellent fortitude, patience, and composure. He fully understands what is desirable, such as seeking and accepting alms, and what is undesirable, such as the faults of origin, their remedies, and the consequences of their acceptance. He does not indulge in food and drink, and he practices correctly. Thus, the elders of the 'kalpa' tradition accept alms free from forty-two faults, while the 'jina-kalpa' tradition accepts five 'abhigrahas' and two 'grahas'. These are:

**Those who are attached and unattached, who are uplifted, who are of little attachment, who have taken and accepted, who have abandoned the Dharma, are the seventh.**

**Or, the one who has taken something, that is his desire, and the other is undesirable. Knowing what is desirable and undesirable, he enters, and when he is unconscious, he should accept pure alms.**

**Commentary:** As described earlier, the virtuous monk remains free from pride. He earns his livelihood through alms. Describing his characteristics, it is said that he is 'mritarch'. He is called 'mritarch' because his body, devoid of rituals like bathing, applying sandalwood paste, etc., is like a corpse. Or, he is called 'mudarch' because he has beautiful and auspicious 'archa' (body) with lotus-like luster. He is endowed with excellent luster. He knows the Dharma, which is based on scriptures and conduct. Such a monk, entering villages, cities, or settlements like 'mandamb' for alms, is endowed with excellent fortitude, patience, and composure. He fully understands what is desirable, such as seeking and accepting alms, and what is undesirable, such as the faults of origin, their remedies, and the consequences of their acceptance.

##  **The Sutra Kritanga Sutra (1)**

(1) **Sanskrit:** संसृष्टि - जिस पदार्थ से हाथ लिप्त हो वही पदार्थ लेना । 
**English:** **Sansrusti** - To take only that which has come into contact with the hand.

(2) **Sanskrit:** असंसृष्टि - जिस पदार्थ से हाथ लिप्त न होता हो तो वस्तुएं लेना ।
**English:** **Asansrusti** - To take only that which has not come into contact with the hand.

(3) **Sanskrit:** उद्धृत - गृहस्थ ने अपने खाने हेतु जो आहार पात्र में रखा हो उसी को लेना ।
**English:** **Udhrut** - To take only that which a householder has placed in a vessel for their own consumption.

(4) **Sanskrit:** अल्प लेप - जिस आहार में घी या तेल आदि का थोड़ा लेप हो वही लेना ।
**English:** **Alp Lep** - To take only that food which has a slight coating of ghee or oil.

(5) **Sanskrit:** उद्गृहीत - जो आहार परोसने हेतु उद्ग्रहित किया गया हो-निकाला गया हो वही लेना ।
**English:** **Udgrit** - To take only that food which has been taken out for serving.

(6) **Sanskrit:** प्रगृहीत - परोसने से अवशिष्ट-बचा हुआ ही लेना ।
**English:** **Pragrit** - To take only that which is left over after serving.

(7) **Sanskrit:** उज्झितधर्म - जो आहार फेंक देने योग्य हो वह लेना ।
**English:** **Ujjhitdharma** - To take only that food which is fit to be discarded.

**Of these, only the last two are acceptable to a Jain ascetic.**  Or, whatever is the nature of one's **abhigraha** (attachment), that is their **aishana** (desire), and the rest is **aneshana** (non-desire).

Thus, if a **Jina-kalpi** ascetic has gone out to beg, they should remain **alolup** (non-greedy) and accept only pure alms.

**Verse 18:**

**Sanskrit:** अरतिं रतिं च अभिभूय भिक्खू, बहुजणे वा तह एगचारी । एगंत मोणेण वियागरेजा, एगस्स जंतो गतिरागती य ॥१८॥ छाया - अरतिं रतिञ्चाभिभूय भिक्षु बहुजनो वा तथैकचारी ।
एकान्तमौनेन व्यागृणीयात्, एकस्य जन्तोर्गतिरागतिश्च ॥

**English:** **Aarti** (displeasure) and **rati** (pleasure) should be overcome by the **bhikkhu** (ascetic), whether they live among many or alone. They should engage in **ekanta mauna** (absolute silence) and remember that a being comes alone and departs alone.

**Commentary:**

Thus, even if a **bhikkhu** finds something that is agreeable to them, they should not be attached to it. They should consider everything as **drisht** (seen) and **adrisht** (unseen), **shruta** (heard) and **ashruta** (unheard). They should be aware of the **mrutkalpadeha** (dead body) and the **sudrishtdharma** (well-observed dharma). They should be aware of **aishana** and **aneshana** and not be overwhelmed by them. When they enter a village or city, they should not be attached to **asanyama** (non-restraint) and should not be overcome by **rati** (pleasure) in **sanyama** (restraint).

The **mahamuni** (great sage) says that even a **bhikkhu** who is **asnat** (cleansed), **malavilsya** (free from impurities), **antpraantavallchanaka** (one who eats only at the end of the day), and **adibhojini** (one who eats only a little), may sometimes be overcome by **arati** (displeasure) due to **karmodaya** (arising of karma). This **arati** may arise in **sanyama** (restraint). The **bhikkhu** should overcome this **arati** by considering the nature of the world and the suffering of **tiryangnaraka** (animals and hell beings). They should also remember that the life of a **samsari** (worldly being) is short.

The **bhikkhu** should engage in **ekanta mauna** (absolute silence) and overcome **rati** (pleasure) in **asanyama** (non-restraint). This **rati** arises from **avadyaanusthan** (wrong practices) and **anadibhavas** (innate tendencies). The **bhikkhu** should overcome this **rati** and engage in **sanyama** (restraint).

The **bhikkhu** may be **bahujana** (one who lives among many) or **ekachari** (one who lives alone). The **bahujana** is one who lives in a **sangha** (community) and has the support of **sanyama** (restraint). The **ekachari** is one who lives alone and is **shil** (virtuous). They may be a **pratibha** (one who has realized the truth) or a **pratipanna** (one who has attained the path). They may be a **jinkalpi** (one who follows the path of the Jinas) or a **vihari** (one who lives in the world).

The **bhikkhu** should engage in **ekanta mauna** (absolute silence) when asked or not asked. They should engage in **sanyama** (restraint) and speak only about **dharma** (righteousness). They should not speak about anything that would hinder **sanyama** (restraint).

The **bhikkhu** should remember that a **janta** (being) comes alone and departs alone. They should remember that a **janta** (being) is **ashay** (without support) and that their **gati** (path) is determined by their **shubhashubhashay** (good and bad karma).

The **bhikkhu** should remember that **ekah** (one) performs **karma** (action) and **ekah** (one) enjoys the **phala** (fruit) of that **karma**

## The Study of the Path

And so on. Thus, in the world, truly, there is no helper other than Dharma. Considering this, the Muni, remaining silent, restrained, should speak only what is conducive to Dharma. ||18||

**Commentary:** The virtuous one, as described earlier, does not experience attachment or aversion upon receiving pleasant objects. He considers what he sees as unseen, and what he hears as unheard. He does not adorn his body as if it were a corpse. He keeps Dharma firmly in his sight, remaining indifferent to desires and aversions, and unattached to food, water, etc. If, upon entering a village or city, he develops an inclination towards non-restraint and aversion towards restraint, he should abandon it, keeping it away from himself. In this regard, the Sutra-kar states that if a great saint, whose body is covered in dirt due to not bathing, and who sustains life through coarse, dry chickpeas, etc., develops a dislike for restraint due to the arising of karmas, he should consider the nature of the world, knowing it as it is. He should contemplate the suffering of hell and animal realms, and considering the short lifespan of worldly beings, he should abandon this aversion towards restraint. Doing so, he should speak words conducive to restraint in solitude. This passage is connected to the following. If, due to past practices, this virtuous one develops an inclination towards non-restraint, towards sinful conduct, he should overcome it, suppressing it, and strive to uphold restraint.

Again, the Sutra-kar describes the qualities of the virtuous one. The virtuous one who resides in a Gachchha, in a Sangha, has many virtuous ones who support his restraint. Whether he is a solitary wanderer, a pratima-pratipanna, a pratima-dhari, or a Jina-kalpi, whether he wanders alone or with many virtuous ones, if someone asks him or not, he should speak in a way that is conducive to restraint, that does not hinder restraint, and that is connected to Dharma. What should the virtuous one do, considering this? Or what should he speak? In this context, the Sutra-kar says: A being goes alone to the next world, carrying his own good and bad karmas. No one helps him. He comes from another existence, from another bhava, with his own karmas. Therefore, it is said: A being acts alone, experiences the fruits of his actions alone, is born alone, attains death alone, and goes to another existence alone, and so on. Therefore, in this world, there is truly no helper other than Dharma. Considering this, the virtuous one should speak words inspired by restraint.

Om Om Om

**Self-reflection, or hearing from others, one should speak Dharma beneficial to the people. Those who are condemned, who are used for the purpose of obtaining results, are not served by the wise, the virtuous.** ||19||

**Translation:** The virtuous one should teach Dharma, knowing it from religious principles, or hearing it from others, in a way that is beneficial to the people. Those actions that are condemned, that are bad, and that are done for the purpose of obtaining results, are not performed by the wise, the virtuous, the self-powerful.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra
**Commentary:**

Another point:  Knowing the four paths of existence (Chaturgati) and their causes (Mithyatva, Aviriti, Pramada, Kshaya, Yoga) through self-reflection or by learning from others, and understanding the nature of liberation (Moksha) as the complete destruction of karma and its causes (Samyak Darshan, Samyak Gyan, Samyak Charitra), one should teach this to others seeking liberation (Mumukshu). What kind of teaching should be given?  

The beings who are born (Praja) - stationary (Sthavar) and mobile (Jangama) - should be taught the Dharma that is beneficial to them.  

Having shown what is to be adopted (Upadaya), the commentary now reveals what is to be avoided (Heya).  

Those who are condemned (Garhita) and repulsive (Jugupsita) - Mithyatva, Aviriti, Pramada, Kshaya, Yoga - are the causes of karmic bondage.  These are used with a motive (Sani Dana).  

The use of words (Prayoga) - actions (Vyaapara) - Dharma stories (Dharma Katha Prabandha) - are done with the motive of gaining something like worship, benefit, or respect.  

The wise and righteous (Sudhir Dharma) - great sages (Maharishi) - do not engage (Na Sevante) in these actions, which are obstacles to righteous conduct (Charitra).  

Or, those who are condemned (Garhita) and have a motive (Sani Dana) - such as those who are deceitful (Kutirthika), engaged in sinful practices (Savadya Anushthan Rata), lacking in good conduct (Nishil Nirvrata), and those who are useless (Kuntal Ventala Kari) - the wise and righteous (Sudhir Dharma) - who pierce the heart (Maramavedi) - do not engage (Na Sevante) in such words, which are thorns (Vak Kantaka). 

**Verse 20:**

**Commentary:**

Another point:  Some people with wrong views (Mithyatva Drishti) - those who are deceitful (Kutirthika) - who are attached to their own views (Svadarshan Agrahi) -  through reasoning (Tarka) - by examining their own opinions (Svamati Paryalocana) - do not understand the intention (Bhav) - the nature of their actions (Karanavritti).  

Some righteous person (Sadhu) or listener (Shravaka) - with the desire to establish their own Dharma - may teach them.

Page #591:
---------------------------
- A person influenced by non-Jain beliefs, who is insistent on his own doctrines, has a corrupted mind and inner feelings. Without understanding him properly, a monk or a lay follower, with the desire to establish his own religion, may speak insulting words to him. The non-Jain, not believing in the monk's words, will show his displeasure, consider the words harsh, and become angry, even resorting to low acts. He may even harm the monk, like the way Skanda Acharya was harmed by his guardian priest. This shows how he can descend to such a low level. 

Seeing this, it is said that the anger of the non-Jain, provoked by the insulting words about his religion, can lead to the destruction of the monk's long life. This means that one should preach Dharma (righteousness) only after knowing the person well. For example, who is this person, a king or someone else? To which deity is he devoted? Which philosophy does he follow, and is he attached to it or not? After knowing all this, one should preach Dharma accordingly. If someone, without knowing this, speaks words that oppose the other person's beliefs, he may even cause the other person's death or harm him in such a way that the monk or lay follower suffers in this life and the next. Therefore, by understanding the other person's intentions, one should preach the principles of true Dharma, the essence of the soul, etc., in a way that benefits both oneself and others.

**20**

Furthermore,

**Commentary:** A wise person should understand the actions and intentions of those to whom he is preaching Dharma. He should try to eliminate their false beliefs. He should explain to them that beauty, women, etc., are dangerous. Those who are attached to them will be destroyed. Therefore, a wise person, understanding the intentions of others, should preach in such a way that it benefits both mobile and immobile beings.

**Shadow:** A wise person should understand the actions and intentions of those to whom he is preaching Dharma. He should try to eliminate their false beliefs. He should explain to them that beauty, women, etc., are dangerous. Those who are attached to them will be destroyed. Therefore, a wise person, understanding the intentions of others, should preach in such a way that it benefits both mobile and immobile beings.

**The Sutra Kritanga Sutra with Commentary - 'Dheer'**

A man who is unshakeable ('akshobhya'), adorned with good understanding ('sadbuddhyalankrito'), and present at a discourse, should understand the 'karma' (actions) of the listener, whether they are of a 'guru' (heavy) or 'laghu' (light) nature, and their 'chanda' (intention). He should correctly 'vivechya' (analyze) and understand this. Knowing this, the speaker should deliver the Dharma discourse in a way that is appropriate for the audience, ensuring that the listener gains understanding of the 'jiva' (soul) and other 'padartha' (objects), and their mind is not corrupted but instead experiences joy. With this intention, the Sutra says, "He should especially 'naya' (guide) and 'apanaya' (remove) the 'papa bhava' (evil tendencies) of the audience." The word 'tu' indicates that he should instill good qualities in them. Some texts read 'ayabhava', which means 'atma bhava' (egoistic tendencies), which are ingrained from time immemorial due to 'mithyatva' (false beliefs) and other such things. He should remove these. Alternatively, 'atma bhava' can also refer to attachment to worldly pleasures, which should also be removed. The Sutra further explains, "He should not 'naya' (guide) them with 'rupa' (forms) that are attractive to the mind, such as the sight of women's limbs, half-glances, etc., which can lead to the downfall of those with weak 'sattva' (strength) from the path of Dharma." What kind of 'rupa' (forms) should be avoided? The answer is, "Those that are 'bhayaavhai' (fearful)." These are forms that induce fear. In this life, those who are attached to sensual pleasures are condemned by the virtuous. They face various forms of ridicule, such as having their ears and noses cut off. In future lives, they are born in hell and other realms of suffering, where they experience pain due to their attachment to sensual pleasures. Thus, a wise and learned 'pandita' (scholar) who is knowledgeable in Dharma discourse, should understand the true intention of the audience and reveal the Dharma that is beneficial to both 'tras' (mobile beings) and 'sthavara' (immobile beings).

**Commentary:**

'Dheer' - unshakeable, not agitated.
'Sadbuddhyalankrito' - adorned with good understanding, possessing excellent intellect.
'Karma' - actions, conduct.
'Guru' - heavy, significant.
'Laghu' - light, insignificant.
'Chanda' - intention, desire.
'Vivechya' - to analyze, to understand.
'Papa bhava' - evil tendencies, negative thoughts.
'Naya' - to guide, to lead.
'Apanaya' - to remove, to eliminate.
'Tu' - indicates the addition of a quality.
'Ayabhava' - egoistic tendencies, attachment to self.
'Atma bhava' - egoistic tendencies, attachment to self.
'Mithyatva' - false beliefs, wrong understanding.
'Rupa' - forms, appearances.
'Bhayaavhai' - fearful, inducing fear.
'Tras' - mobile beings, animals.
'Sthavara' - immobile beings, plants.

**Verse 22:**

"Neither should one seek praise nor be a lover of verses, nor should one do what is pleasing or displeasing to anyone. A monk who is free from all evil, unperturbed, and free from attachments is truly a monk."

**Commentary:**

This verse emphasizes the importance of detachment, humility, and equanimity in the life of a monk. A true monk should not seek praise or recognition, nor should they be swayed by the opinions of others. They should strive to be free from all evil, unperturbed by external circumstances, and free from attachments to worldly things.

## The Study of Truth

**Translation:** A Sadhu should not seek praise or glory through his teachings. He should not say anything that is pleasing to some and displeasing to others. He should renounce all evil deeds and teach Dharma with a pure heart, free from passions.

**Commentary:** The Sutra means that a Sadhu should perform all religious practices, such as austerities, without seeking any reward, such as praise, respect, or material possessions. This is especially true when teaching Dharma. A Sadhu should not desire praise or fame for his teachings. He should not tell stories that are pleasing to some and displeasing to others, such as tales of kings, gossip, or deceitful stories. He should not criticize deities that are worshipped by others. He should be free from attachment and aversion, and should consider the needs of his listeners. He should teach Dharma in a way that is appropriate for them. The Sutra concludes by saying that a Sadhu should renounce all evil deeds, both those he has committed himself and those committed by others, and should teach Dharma with a pure heart, free from passions.

**Verse 23:**

**Translation:** A Sadhu, seeing the truth, should renounce all violence towards all beings. He should not desire life or death, and should renounce the world, free from the bonds of Maya.

**Commentary:** This verse concludes the discussion of the study of truth. It says that a Sadhu should see the truth of Dharma and renounce all violence towards all beings, both large and small. He should not desire life or death, but should renounce the world and be free from the bonds of Maya.

Page #594:
---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states that one should not transgress the truth even in the face of death, abandoning the 'Nidhaya' (the act of killing). This is further explained: A virtuous person should not desire a long life through the suffering of stationary and mobile beings, nor should they desire a life of unrestrained indulgence. Even when defeated by hardship, overwhelmed by pain, and unable to bear it, they should not seek death by drowning, burning, or being killed by a predator. Thus, with a focus on truth, they should refrain from harming all beings, be indifferent to life and death, and practice restraint. They should be a wise person, living within the boundaries of the scriptures, knowledgeable, and free from the captivating karma of Maya. The word 'iti' here signifies completion. I speak as before.

This concludes the thirteenth study, known as 'Yathatatya'.

Just as a young bird, without feathers, wants to fly away from its nest but is unable to, and is thus hunted by predators like hawks, so too a Jain who wanders alone without the guidance of a teacher is vulnerable and will be destroyed.

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The study of the text
Presenting the commentary and illustration, it is said to show the patient one (dāntika) - 'Thus' the word indicates a special distinction from the previous one. For, in the previous verse, the undeveloped state (avyaktatā) was expounded, but here the special feature is the imperfection (apuṣṭadharmatā) or immaturity of the dharma. Just as the fledglings, who have not yet developed their wings, are destroyed by the wicked creatures, similarly, the newly initiated disciple, who has not yet grasped the meaning of the sūtra, is deceived by many heretical (pāṣaṇḍika) people. They lure him away from the Saṃgha (ocean) and make him inclined towards sensual pleasures, free from the fear of the next world. Or thinking that his conduct is worthless due to improper practice, they snatch him away like the fledglings, these sinful people with minds polluted by false beliefs, non-restraint, negligence and passions - whether they are heretics, one's own people, kings, or many others - have taken away and will continue to take away (such a disciple).

Here, the past tense is used to denote the three time periods. The heretics thus deceive the disciple who has not grasped the meaning (agītārtha). They say that in your doctrine, there are no practices like kindling fire, removing poison, or cutting the crest, and there is also no attainment of the eight supernatural powers like Aṇimā. It is also not supported by many, including the kings. Even the non-violence that is expounded in your scriptures is difficult to accomplish in this world full of living beings. Nor do you have the bodily purity of bathing and cleanliness, and with such deceitful and illusory speeches, they delude the innocent people. Even their own people thus delude him, saying, "Venerable one! Without you, we have no one to support or be supported by. You alone are our everything, without you, everything appears void." Thus, they make him fall away from the true dharma and the enjoyment of sense objects.

Page #598:
---------------------------
## The Sutra of the Sri Sutra Kritanga

Ho! Without you, everything appears to us as void - it seems that by inviting us to enjoy objects of sense, they lead us away from the true Dharma. In the same way, kings also do this, one should understand. In this way, they deceive and corrupt the solitary, immature sadhu in many ways.

**Osaṇamicche maṇue samahiṁ, aṇosiē ṇantkariṁti ṇacca. Obhāsamāṇe daviyassa vittaṁ, ṇ ṇikkase bahiya āsunō. ||4||**

**Chāyā**
Avasānam icchēd manujaḥ samādhi manushito nāntakara iti jñātvā.
Avabhāsayan dravyasya vṛttaṁ, na niṣkasedv ahirāśu prajñaḥ. ||

**Om Om Om**

• The sadhu who does not reside in the guru-kula cannot sever the karmas. Knowing this -

**Anuvāda**
He should always reside in the guru-kula and have the aspiration to follow the supreme restraint of samādhi. He should accept the conduct by which the sadhu attains liberation. He should not go outside the gaccha.

**Tīkā** - Thus, many faults arise in a solitary sadhu, therefore, he should always remain at the feet of the guru. To show this, the sutra says, "Avasānam" - the place near the guru, "samādhiṁ" - the practice of the right path, "icchēd" - he should desire, "manujo" - the human being, meaning the sadhu. He is truly a human being who fulfills his vows, and this is fulfilled by always remaining near the guru and practicing samādhi. This is shown by the fact that he is "anuṣitaḥ" - not established, acting according to his own will, near the guru, he does not become "nāntakara" - one who does not fulfill the vows of samādhi, the practice of the right conduct. Knowing this, he should always reside in the guru-kula, for one who does not do so, his knowledge will be ridiculed. It is said:

"Na hi bhavati nirvigopākamanupāsita gurukulasya vijñānam. Prakatitapaścādbhāgam paśyata nṛtyam mayūrasya. ||1||"

Similarly, seeing the sand stuck to the neck of a peacock, a person who has not served a guru, struck the queen with his heel, causing her neck to swell. Thus, there are many faults of one who has not served a guru, such as increasing samsara. Understanding this, one should remain near the guru. "Avabhāsayan" - illuminating, practicing correctly, "dravyasya" - the conduct of the true sadhu, free from attachment and aversion, omniscient, or the practice of the right conduct. He should illuminate this practice, or the dharma-kathāka should illuminate it by speaking. Thus, since residing in the guru-kula is the foundation of many virtues, "na niṣkaset" - he should not go out, from the gaccha, or from the presence of the guru, he should not become self-willed, "āśu prajñaḥ" - quick-witted, residing near him, knowing that he is being overcome by the objects of sense and passions, he quickly "nivartayati" - turns back, establishes himself in the right samādhi, either by the guru's instruction or by his own effort. ||4||

Thus, in the practice of renunciation, one should always reside in the guru-kula, and be useful in all matters, such as place, bed, and seat. Explaining the virtues of one who is useful, I say...

**Tīkā-rtha** - As explained earlier, many faults arise in a solitary sadhu, therefore, he should always remain at the feet of the guru - in the shelter of his feet. The sutra-kāra shows this, saying - a human being should always reside in the presence of the guru and aspire to follow the practice of the supreme path of liberation. He is truly a human being - a sadhu - who fulfills his vows as promised. He is truly...

Page #599:
---------------------------
In the study of scriptures, the true human being resides. The vow to always dwell in the presence of the Guru and to follow the path of liberation through virtuous Samadhi can only be fulfilled, not otherwise.  Illustrating this, it is said: "One who does not reside near the Guru is disorganized, lacking in order, and acts according to their own whims. They are not capable of fulfilling the vow, the excellent conduct-based karma, the well-established practice. Knowing this, one should always reside in the Guru's abode. One should follow the righteous path. The knowledge of one who is devoid of it is laughable. It is said: "The knowledge of one who has not worshipped the Guru's abode is not truly protected, for without the Guru's teachings, the peacock's rear end is exposed while dancing. Seeing the sand clinging to the goat's neck fall off with a kick, another ignorant man, who has not been engaged in the worship of the Guru, killed the queen with his kick, whose neck had a knot." Many faults arise in one who has not worshipped the Guru, which increase worldly attachments. Knowing this, one should reside near the Guru with this stated conduct. The Sutrakar, expressing this, says: "One should understand the conduct, the practice, or the excellent conduct of the liberated, the supreme sage, the knower of all, who is free from attachment and aversion, the explainer of Dharma." Residing in the Guru's abode brings many virtues. Therefore, the sage should not leave their lineage or the Guru's presence, and should not become self-willed. When the sage, endowed with sharp intellect, residing near the Guru, experiences that objects and passions are consuming, overwhelming their soul, they should remove themselves from that situation, following the Acharya's instructions or their own soul, and establish themselves in Samadhi.

Thus, the sage, engaged in the development of their renounced life, always resides in the Guru's abode, conducting themselves appropriately in all places, sleeping, sitting, etc.  Highlighting the qualities gained by the sage engaged in this, the Sutrakar says:

"Those who are well-behaved in their place, sleeping, and sitting, and in their efforts, are well-versed in assemblies and secrets, and speak separately."

Translation: The sage who resides in the Guru's abode is engaged in the best way in matters related to place, sleeping, sitting, and effort-restraint. They are well-versed in assemblies and secrets, and follow them. They teach others.

Commentary: "He who is renounced from the world, and is engaged in renunciation, always resides in the Guru's abode, 'in place,' taking refuge in a place, and 'in sleeping,' taking refuge in sleeping, and 'in sitting,' taking refuge in sitting. The first 'ca' indicates a collection, the second 'ca' indicates an unmentioned collection, and 'in effort,' taking refuge in going and coming, and in the practice of austerities. 'Well-behaved' - those whose conduct is like that of the engaged sage. 'Well-behaved' - where the place is - the body's relaxation, etc.

Page #600:
---------------------------
The Sutra Kritanga Sutra prescribes the actions of proper disregard, etc. It prescribes the shedding of the body like a mountain, without any tremor, and without any attachment to the body. Similarly, while sleeping, one should disregard the bed, the ground, and the body, and sleep only when permitted by the Guru at the time of the prescribed action. Even while sleeping, one should not be completely unconscious, like when awake. Similarly, while sitting, etc., one should remain as before, with a contracted body, devoted to study and meditation, and become a good Sadhu. Thus, a resident of the Guru's house, who performs such good actions, becomes a good Sadhu. Moreover, while residing in the Guru's house, one should be aware of the five Samitis, such as walking, etc., and the three Guptis, which are of the form of contemplation and non-contemplation. The knowledge that arises from these becomes the knowledge of the one who has come, and the one who has arisen, and the one who has developed the discernment of duty. One should also explain to others, separately and individually, the grace of the Guru, the nature of the Samitis and Guptis, and their proper observance, and the benefits thereof. ||5||

Commentary: A renunciate, who is disillusioned and detached from the world, always resides in the Guru's house, and is diligent in his actions, such as standing, sleeping, sitting, and performing austerities, and conducts himself like a good Sadhu. A good Sadhu, when performing the shedding of the body, etc., does so after properly observing and cleaning the place. In the shedding of the body, he remains steady like a mountain, without any desire or longing in the body. At the time of sleep, he properly observes the bed, the ground, and his own body, and sleeps only when permitted by the Guru at the time prescribed by the scriptures. Even while sleeping, he remains like one who is awake, not unconscious. Similarly, when sitting, etc., he sits with his body contracted and properly folded, and remains devoted to study and meditation. A resident of the Guru's house, who performs such good actions, becomes a good Sadhu. While residing in the Guru's house, he becomes aware of the five Samitis, such as walking, etc., and the three Guptis, which are of the form of contemplation and non-contemplation, and develops the discernment of duty. By the grace and favor of the Guru, he comes to know the nature of the Samitis and Guptis, and observes them properly, and teaches others about their benefits.

The one who is free from Asrava, who is endowed with the Samitis, such as walking, etc., and the Guptis, should listen to sweet and pleasant sounds, such as those of the flute and the lute, and also to fearful and harsh sounds, without attachment or aversion. He should not indulge in sleep-induced carelessness, and if he has any doubts about anything, he should ask the Guru and get clarification. ||6||

Shadow: Having heard the sounds, the one who is free from Asrava should wander among them.
The monk should not indulge in carelessness due to sleep, and how can he be free from doubts?

Translation: The one who is free from Asrava, who is endowed with the Samitis, such as walking, etc., and the Guptis, should listen to sweet and pleasant sounds, such as those of the flute and the lute, and also to fearful and harsh sounds, without attachment or aversion. He should not indulge in sleep-induced carelessness, and if he has any doubts about anything, he should ask the Guru and get clarification.

Commentary: To show what should be done by the one who is endowed with the Samitis, such as walking, etc., it is said: "Having heard" the sweet and pleasant sounds, such as those of the flute and the lute, or "fearful" sounds, such as those that are harsh to the ears, the one who is free from Asrava, who is neither attached nor averse to them, should wander among them, i.e., he should remain steadfast in his practice of restraint. Similarly, the "monk" should not indulge in "sleep-induced carelessness," because it is a form of carelessness. This means that carelessness due to listening to sounds is prohibited, and carelessness due to sleep is also prohibited. And carelessness due to other things, such as idle talk, etc., is also prohibited.

A student should not engage in activities that lead to passions and other such things. Thus, a wise person who has resided in a guru's abode, and who has attained knowledge in matters of place, sleep, posture, assembly, and secrecy, and who has renounced all carelessness, will, through the guru's teachings, somehow overcome doubt and mental disturbance. Or, if he thinks, "This burden of the five great vows is too heavy, how can I possibly bear it to the end?" he will, through the guru's grace, overcome such doubt. Or, if he experiences any mental disturbance, he will, while residing in the guru's abode, overcome it completely and will also be able to help others overcome their disturbances. ||6||

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Chapter 7**

A sadhu who is constantly being guided towards non-repetition (apunahakarana) should accept the guidance and respond to it. If he does not accept it properly, he is considered to be carried away by the stream of samsara, being dragged along and disciplined. He becomes angry and does not become a crosser of the ocean of samsara. Even if he is being guided towards liberation by the teachings of an Acharya or others, and he is being prevented from falling into carelessness, he still does not become a crosser of the ocean of samsara because he does not follow the guidance.

**Commentary:**

If a sadhu, while staying in the presence of a guru, makes a mistake due to carelessness, then a younger sadhu, either in age or in the stage of initiation, will prevent him from making that mistake. Or, a sadhu who is older in knowledge of the scriptures or in age will stop him from doing so, disciplining him and saying that such careless conduct is not appropriate for a person like him. Or, a sadhu who is senior in the stage of Ratnaadhika-pravrajya, or who is distinguished in knowledge of the scriptures, or who is of the same age, will discipline him and encourage him not to be careless. If, upon being disciplined, the sadhu becomes angry at the one who is disciplining him and says, "I am born into a noble family. I am respected by everyone. This insignificant being is disciplining me, teaching me," then he does not say "micchami dukkadam" for his conduct, and he does not rise properly, he does not come back to his true nature as a sadhu, and he does not remain steadfast in the discipline given. He does not accept, "I will not do that again." He gives a counter-response to the one who is guiding him and starts teaching him. Then that sadhu flows in the stream of samsara. He becomes angry at being disciplined, and therefore he cannot cross the ocean of samsara. Or, if an Acharya or others try to guide him towards liberation by giving him good teachings and encouraging him not to fall into carelessness, but he does not follow their discipline, then he cannot cross the ocean of samsara.

**Chapter 8**

**Verse:**

Viutthitenam samayaanusivve, daharena vuddhena u coie ya. Accuttiyae ghaddasiae va, agarinam va samayaasi.

**Shadow:**

Vyutthitenam samayaanusisto daharena vuddhena tu coditha ca. Atyutthitaya ghatadasyaava agarinam va samayaanusista.

**Translation:**

Even if a sadhu is guided towards good conduct by a householder who is opposed to the teachings, or by someone younger or older, or even by a lowly servant girl who performs menial tasks, he should not become angry.

**Commentary:**

Now, after discussing the encouragement of one's own side, the commentary discusses the encouragement of the other side. It says, "Vyutthita" - one who has risen in opposition, a householder who is a non-Jain, or one who holds a wrong view. He is guided by his own time, for example, "Such conduct is not established for you, you are inclined towards this." Or, "Vyutthita" - one who has fallen from restraint, another sadhu who has made a mistake and is disciplined by his own time, according to the teachings established by the Arhats, for example, "This is not allowed for you, such as fast travel." Or, he is guided by someone else who holds a wrong view, or by someone who is "kshullka" - small, younger, or older, who has a bad character, and the word "tu" indicates that he is of the same age. Or, "Atyutthita" - those who have risen in opposition to performing even the smallest tasks, or "dasya" - a servant girl, who is very lowly, and the commentary clarifies this by saying "ghatadasya" - a water carrier. Even if he is guided by her, he should not...

**[The text continues, but the translation ends here as the provided text is incomplete.]**

Page #603:
---------------------------
The study of scriptures should not lead to anger. This is said because even when someone is extremely agitated and provoked, believing it to be in their own best interest, a virtuous person should not be angry, let alone someone else. Similarly, when a householder is being disciplined according to the rules of conduct for householders, even if they are being told that what they are doing is not appropriate for householders, they should not be angry. Even if they are being provoked by their own mind, believing that this is for their own good, they should not let their mind be corrupted. ||8||

This is the meaning of the commentary: After explaining the discipline given by virtuous people on their own side, the author of the sutras speaks about the discipline given by both those on their own side and those on the other side. Those who are opposed to the teachings of the scriptures are called "viruddhotthapena utthita". These include those who are against the teachings, householders, and those with false beliefs. When a virtuous person makes a mistake due to carelessness, they should be guided by a virtuous person of their own time, according to the teachings accepted by them. They should be told that their scriptures do not prescribe the rituals and conduct they are engaging in. Or, if a virtuous person who has fallen from restraint is trying to guide another virtuous person who is slipping in their observance of vows, they should guide them according to the teachings of the Tirthankaras, based on the principles of the original and subsequent qualities. They should quote the scriptures and say that actions like running fast are not permitted or approved by the scriptures. Similarly, if a person with false beliefs, whether younger or older, sees a virtuous person engaging in disgraceful, inauspicious, or condemned conduct, they should guide them towards righteous conduct. Here, the word "tu" refers to a person of the same age, who should also guide them. If someone sees another person engaging in extremely inappropriate actions and tries to guide them, or if a servant, being very eager to do their duty, is very insistent in trying to get someone to stop doing inappropriate and trivial things, even a maid, water-carrier, or servant should guide them towards righteous conduct. The virtuous person should not be angry. The point is that even if a maid, seeing someone engaging in unrighteous conduct, becomes extremely angry and guides them towards righteous conduct, the virtuous person should not be angry, considering it to be in their own best interest. Then, what to speak of being angry when someone else gives them advice? If a householder is being disciplined according to the rules of conduct for householders, or according to the traditions of their time, and they are told that what they are doing is not appropriate for householders, even if they are being told this with disdain, they should not be angry. They should understand that this is for their own good and not let any negativity arise in their mind. This is further explained as follows:

"They should not be angry, nor should they be distressed, nor should they speak harshly. They should promise to do so, knowing that this is for their own good, and not be careless." ||9||

Commentary: "Tesh" refers to those who are on their own side or the other side, who are trying to guide them. They should not be angry, believing it to be in their own best interest. Nor should they be angry when someone else speaks harshly to them. They should think:

"When someone is angry, their mind should be directed towards understanding the truth. If it is true, why be angry? If it is false, why be angry?" ||1||

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

If a virtuous person's conduct slips, and both those on his side and those on the opposing side point out his slip and speak harshly to him, he should not be angry with those who point it out. He should think, "I should contemplate the truth of what this angry, wise person has said. If his anger is true, then what is there to be angry about? If it is false, then what good is anger?"

Even if a person of lower standing than himself, guided by the path of the Arhat, or following the customs of the world, advises him, the virtuous person should contemplate the ultimate truth and not cause distress or pain to the advisor. He should not speak harshly or cause him pain. Instead, he should say, "This is my fault, for I am engaged in improper conduct, and this is why he is advising me. If the advisor says, 'You should not engage in such improper conduct, but rather follow the conduct of the ancient sages,' the virtuous person should contemplate with a neutral mind and vow, 'I will do so from now on.' He should also repent for his past misdeeds, thinking, 'May my misdeeds be false and not affect my life again.' He should think, 'The advice I have received is for my own good. By not following it, I will harm myself.' Thus, he should be afraid of himself and not be careless. He should not engage in improper conduct.

## Commentary

The commentary explains that the virtuous person should not be angry with those who point out his mistakes, but should instead contemplate the truth of their words. He should also repent for his past misdeeds and vow to do better in the future. The commentary also emphasizes the importance of following the path of the Arhat and the conduct of the ancient sages.

## Verse 10

**Original:** वणंसि मूढस्स जहा अमूढा, मग्गाणुसासंति हितं पयाणं । तणेव (तेणावि) मज्झं इणमेव सेयं, जं मे बुहा समणुसासयति ॥१०॥

**Translation:** Just as in a forest, the ignorant are guided by the wise, who show them the right path for their benefit, so too, I consider it beneficial for me to be guided by the wise.

**Commentary:** This verse uses the analogy of a lost person in a forest being guided by the wise to illustrate the importance of following the guidance of the wise. The virtuous person should be happy to be guided by the wise, as it is for his own benefit.

Page #605:
---------------------------
The study of scriptures is considered to be the best. Even if one is urged by someone who has not followed the right path, one should not be angry, but should think, "This is a favor to me." For what the enlightened ones teach and guide one towards the right path, like a father to his son, is for my own good. ||10||

The commentator, explaining the sutra, says: In a dense forest, if someone is lost and confused, and is afraid, having lost the right path, then some other men, who know the right and wrong paths, out of compassion, will guide him away from the wrong path and show him the path that is free from all obstacles and leads to the desired destination. He considers himself fortunate to be guided by those men who know the right and wrong. Similarly, if the aforementioned man, who is not following the right path, is urged by someone, he should not be angry with them. He should think, "This is a favor to me." Just as a father guides his son, teaches him the right things, and brings him to the right path, similarly, the teachings given to me by the Jina-knowers are also for my good.

He, the ignorant one, should worship the enlightened one with special reverence. This is the simile given there by the hero, who correctly explains the meaning. ||11||

**Commentary:** To further strengthen this meaning, the commentator says: Here, the word "atha" is used to indicate what follows, or to begin a sentence. For example, the ignorant man, who has been brought to the right path, should consider it a great favor to be taught the right path by the enlightened one, like Pulinda, and should worship him with special reverence. Thus, the hero, the Tirthankara or some other Ganadhara, has "explained" this simile, "following" the meaning, the ultimate truth, the urging, the great favor, and applying it to himself. For example, I have been saved from the many troubles of birth, old age, death, and false beliefs by this one who gives good advice. Therefore, I should worship this one who has done me a great favor, with respect, humility, etc. There are many examples of this, such as:

"Just as a house is engulfed in flames, and someone is burning, whoever wakes up the sleeping one is that person's best friend. ||1|| Just as a dish mixed with poison is offered to someone who wants to eat, whoever points out the fault is that person's best friend. ||2||"

**Commentary:** To strengthen this meaning, the commentator says: Here, the word "atha" is used to indicate what follows, or to begin a sentence. For example, the ignorant man, who has been brought to the right path, should consider it a great favor to be taught the right path by the enlightened one, like Pulinda, and should worship him with special reverence.

Therefore, I should worship this one who has done me a great favor, with respect, humility, etc. There are many examples of this, such as:

Page #606:
---------------------------
The Sutra Kritanga Sutra, which is the guide to the right path, should be especially honored by considering the great benefit of the Pulinda, Kirata, etc., who show the right path. Bhagwan Mahavira or the Ganadharas have presented this analogy or example in this regard. By following it, understanding its essence or secret, the Sadhu establishes the benefit given by inspiration in his soul. Just as I have been freed from the forest of falsehood, which is full of many troubles like birth, old age, death, etc., by the advice of this man. Therefore, I should worship this supremely benevolent man by standing in front of him when he comes, with respect, humility, etc. There are many examples in this regard. For example, the one who wakes up a sleeping man in a house burning with fire is his closest relative and benefactor. And the one who tells a man who is about to eat sweet food mixed with poison that the food is faulty and prevents him from eating it is his closest relative and well-wisher.

Just as a guide cannot know the way in a dark night, not seeing, he knows the way when the sun rises, illuminated.

Commentary: This is another example given by the Sutra. Just as a guide, even though he is familiar with the area, cannot know the way in a dark night covered by heavy clouds, because the way is covered by darkness, he cannot see his own hands, etc., he does not know it properly. The same guide, when the sun rises, the darkness is removed, and the sky is illuminated, he knows the way, which is marked by stones, caves, high and low places, etc., he sees the desired place, he understands it properly by considering its defects and qualities.

Thus, the Sutra presents an example and then explains its essence.

Similarly, a person who is not firm in Dharma, does not know Dharma, not understanding. He, when he gets angry, does not see the Dharma, like the eyes see when the sun rises.

**Study of the Text**

Even if a student is not well-established in Dharma, and does not know Dharma because he is not aware of it, he becomes a *kovida* (expert) in the words of the Jinas and sees everything like the eye after sunrise.

**Translation**

A student who is not well-established in Dharma, who is not nourished by Dharma, and who is ignorant of the meaning of the sutras, does not know Dharma. But when he becomes a *kovida* (expert) in the words of the Jinas, he sees everything like the eye after sunrise.

**Commentary**

Just as a traveler in a dense forest, covered in darkness, cannot find his way, but after sunrise, when the darkness is gone, he finds his way, so too, a newly initiated student, who is not well-versed in the meaning of the sutras, does not know Dharma, which is based on the scriptures and conduct, and which is capable of saving a being from hell. This newly initiated student is not *agita* (one who has understood the meaning of the scriptures), he is ignorant of the meaning of the sutras, and therefore does not understand Dharma. But later, after living in the *gurukul* (monastery), he becomes a *kovida* (expert) in the words of the Jinas, having studied the scriptures written by the omniscient ones. He becomes skilled and sees all beings and objects as they are, just like the eye after the darkness is gone. This is what is being said: just as objects like pots and cloths are clearly perceived through the contact of the senses, so too, through the scriptures written by the omniscient ones, subtle, hidden, and distant things like heaven, liberation, and deities are clearly perceived without any doubt. Moreover, sometimes the eye perceives an object differently from what it is, for example, a mirage in the desert is perceived as water, and a cluster of *kinshuka* flowers is perceived as fire. But there is no error in the scriptures written by the omniscient ones, because if there were, it would mean that they are not omniscient, and it is impossible for an omniscient being to make a mistake.

**Verse 14**

**Om Om Om**

**Uddham aheyam tiriyam disasu, tasa ya je thavara je ya pana. Saya jae tesu parivvajjā, manappaosam avicampamāne.**

**Translation**

Above, below, and in all directions, whether they are stationary or moving, all beings are worthy of compassion. Therefore, one should practice non-violence towards all beings, with a mind that is unshakable.

**Commentary**

This verse emphasizes the importance of non-violence and compassion towards all beings, regardless of their form or movement. It also highlights the importance of cultivating a mind that is unshakable in its commitment to non-violence.

**The Sutra Kritanga Sutra**

**Shadow:** In the upward, downward, and horizontal directions, and in all directions, those who are trembling and those who are stationary, all beings.
**Translation:** The virtuous one should always be mindful of all beings in the upward, downward, and horizontal directions, and in all directions, those who are trembling and those who are stationary. He should remain steadfast in his practice, without any hatred towards them.
**Commentary:** The student, having resided in the Guru's house, becomes knowledgeable of the words of the Jinas, and being learned, knows the root virtues and the subsequent virtues. The Sutra-maker, taking the root virtues as the subject, says: "In the upward, downward, and horizontal directions, and in all directions," by this, the area of non-violence towards beings is established. In terms of substance, he shows: "Those who tremble" - these are the beings of fire, air, and those with two senses, etc. And those who are stationary - those who are born with the stationary karma, such as earth, water, and plants, and those who are subtle, coarse, sufficient, insufficient, and all ten types of beings who have life, are called beings. "Always" - at all times. By this, the non-violence towards beings is established in terms of time. "He should wander" - he should wander around, practicing restraint. He shows non-violence towards beings in terms of feeling: "He should not harbor hatred in his mind towards stationary and mobile beings, whether they do him harm or good." Even if they harm him, he should not even think ill of them. "Unwavering" - he should always abide by good conduct, without wavering from his restraint. Thus, he should abide by non-violence towards beings in terms of substance, area, time, and feeling, through the three yogas and the three karmas, being free from attachment and aversion. In the same way, he should abide by the remaining great vows and the subsequent virtues, being equipped with the teachings of acceptance, consumption, and education.

**Verse 15:**
**Shadow:** With a tail of black, he is restrained in his desires, seeking the wealth of the enemy. The wise one should lead him forward, and this is the only way to be liberated.

Study of the text called Granthanāmaka
One should ask questions about the people, knowing the right time, from the Samita, who is well-versed in conduct and ethics. The listener should separately internalize this, the Kaivalika samadhi.
Translation - Knowing the right time, one should ask questions about the people, from the Samita, who is well-versed in conduct and ethics. One should respect the Acharya, the teacher of the Sarvajñokta Āgama, and internalize their teachings.
Commentary - The author of the sutra is teaching humility to the disciple who lives with the Guru. The meaning of the sutra, or both, should be asked from the Acharya, knowing the right time to ask. The word "praja" refers to living beings, and the question should be about the fourteen types of beings. One should ask the Acharya, who is well-versed in conduct and ethics, about the living beings. The Acharya, when asked, should be listened to with respect. When the Acharya speaks, they show the path to liberation. The "dravya" is the one who is worthy of liberation, or the one who is free from attachment and aversion. The Acharya, who speaks well about the "dravya", their conduct, restraint, knowledge, or the Āgama that they have formulated, should be respected. How? The author of the sutra says, "tad" - the teachings given by the Acharya should be heard with attention. The listener should internalize it separately, with respect, in their heart. The author of the sutra shows what should be internalized. "Samkhyāy" - knowing well, "ima" - as will be said, this Kaivalika - the Kaivalika samadhi, the path to liberation, the teachings of the Acharya, should be internalized separately, in the heart.

**The Sutra Kritanga Sutra**

Translation - According to the teachings of the Guru, a virtuous Sadhu should protect and save all beings through their mind, speech, and body. By following the principles of Samiti and Gupti, one can achieve Karma Nirodha (cessation of Karma) and Karma Kshaya (destruction of Karma). This is what the omniscient beings have declared. They are the Triloka Darshi (seers of the three worlds), the great souls who say that a Sadhu should never indulge in Pramada (negligence).

Commentary -  Furthermore, while residing in the Guru's abode, the disciple, having heard and understood the teachings, should firmly establish them in their heart. By remaining steadfast in this state of Samadhi (meditation) and on the path of liberation, they should protect themselves through their mind, speech, and body, and through actions, instigated actions, and approvals. They should also protect others by giving good advice. Such a Sadhu, who protects themselves and others, and who remains in the state of Samadhi and on the path of liberation, following the principles of Samiti and Gupti, will attain peace. All their dualities (conflicts) will be eliminated, and their Karma will be completely destroyed. The wise ones have declared this. Who are these wise ones? The Sutrakar (author of the Sutra) reveals that they are the Triloka Darshi, the Tirthankaras (omniscient beings) who see the beings of the three worlds (heaven, earth, and hell). As mentioned earlier, they see all beings with their Kevala Jnana (omniscient knowledge) and preach accordingly. These Triloka Darshi have declared that the path of Samiti, Gupti, etc., is the path to liberation from the cycle of birth and death. They have not declared that Pramada, indulgence in alcohol, sensual pleasures, etc., is a path to liberation.

**Verse 17**

**Translation** - Having heard the teachings, the monk becomes insightful and knowledgeable, seeking the desired goal. By accepting the teachings, practicing austerities, and maintaining silence, he attains liberation through pure conduct.

Page #611:
---------------------------
The study of scriptures, commentary - The monk residing in the gurukul, having 'heard' and understood the essence of the substance, knowing for himself the desired purpose - the purpose of liberation, and having correctly known the objects to be abandoned and the objects to be adopted, becomes 'brilliant' with innate brilliance due to his constant residence in the gurukul. Thus, due to his correct knowledge of his own principles, he becomes 'expert' in explaining the true nature of things to the listeners. What is taken by the seeker of liberation is called 'aadana', which is correct knowledge, etc. He considers that as his purpose - goal, and being thus endowed with the benefit of knowledge, etc., he adopts the twelve types of austerities and the restraint that is the form of the restraint of inflow. Having attained these austerities and restraints through the two-fold education of learning and practice, he is free from all negligence, brilliant and expert. He sustains himself with pure, unconditioned food, free from the defects of origin, etc., and attains liberation, which is the characteristic of the destruction of the remaining karmas. 'He does not go to Mara' - this is the reading in some places. Many beings die under the control of their own karmas. That Mara - the cycle of existence - is full of birth, old age, death, disease, and sorrow. The monk who walks on the pure path, who is engaged in restraint, does not go to that cycle of existence. Or, if death - the characteristic of the giving up of life - is called Mara, he does not go to that many times. For, being endowed with non-falling right faith, he dies at most in seven or eight existences, not more. ||17||

Commentary - The monk residing in the gurukul, having heard the virtuous conduct that is useful for liberation through the substance, understands his own desired purpose, and having correctly known the objects to be abandoned and the objects to be adopted, becomes brilliant due to his constant residence in the gurukul. Due to his knowledge of his own principles, he becomes skilled or proficient in explaining the true nature of things to the listeners. What is taken by the seeker of liberation is called 'aadana', which is correct knowledge, etc. Considering that as his purpose - goal, he adopts the twelve types of austerities and the restraint that is the form of the restraint of inflow. Having attained these austerities and restraints through the two-fold education of learning and practice, he sustains himself with pure, unconditioned food, free from the defects of origin, etc., and destroys all karmas, attaining liberation. "He does not go to Mara" - this reading is found in some places. This means that the cycle of existence, in which beings repeatedly die due to the results of their own karmas, is called Mara. The monk who walks on the pure path, who is engaged in restraint, does not go to that cycle of existence. The one who is afflicted with birth, old age, death, disease, and sorrow, or the giving up of life is called Mara. He does not go to that - death - repeatedly, because being endowed with non-falling right faith, he dies at most in seven or eight existences, not more.

They explain the Dharma with numbers, the Buddhas are their destroyers of death. They are the crossers of both, for liberation, they give the answer to the question after investigation. ||18||

Shadow - They explain the Dharma with numbers, the Buddhas are their destroyers of death. They are the crossers of both, for liberation, they give the answer to the question after investigation. ||

They liberate themselves and others from the bondage of karmas and cross the ocean of existence. Such great men give the answer to the question after investigation and deliberation.

Commentary - Thus, the one who resides in the gurukul, who is well-established in Dharma, who is well-versed, brilliant, and expert in meaning, does what he does. To show that, he says - the number-wisdom, by which Dharma is correctly known - understood, by that, knowing Dharma for himself, he explains it to others as it is. 'Dharma' -

## The Sutra of the Sutrakritanga
## Chapter on the Shrutacharitra

This chapter explains how those who are able to teach the Dharma do so. They understand their own abilities and the abilities of the audience, and they clearly understand the meaning of what they are teaching. These are the Buddhas, who know the three times (past, present, and future) and who are able to destroy the karmas accumulated from past lives. They are also able to help others destroy their karmas. They are the ones who truly understand the Dharma and are able to liberate themselves and others from the bonds of karma and attachment. They are able to cross the ocean of samsara.

These Buddhas are careful in their speech. They examine their words before speaking, considering the person they are speaking to and the meaning they are trying to convey. They also carefully consider any questions they are asked and give appropriate answers. As it is said:

"**A person who has understood the meaning from the Acharya, and who remembers it well, can speak easily and successfully in the midst of the Sangha.**"

Therefore, those who teach the Dharma in this way are able to liberate themselves and others.

## Commentary

The Sutrakar explains that the ability to understand the Dharma is called "knowledge." This knowledge is gained through good understanding and the study of the Shrutacharitra. Those who have this knowledge are able to teach the Dharma effectively. They understand their own abilities and the abilities of others, and they are able to clearly explain the Dharma to the audience. These Buddhas are able to destroy their own karmas and help others destroy theirs. They are able to liberate themselves and others from the bonds of karma and attachment. They are able to cross the ocean of samsara.

These Buddhas are careful in their speech. They examine their words before speaking, considering the person they are speaking to and the meaning they are trying to convey. They also carefully consider any questions they are asked and give appropriate answers. As it is said:

"**A person who has understood the meaning from the Acharya, and who remembers it well, can speak easily and successfully in the midst of the Sangha.**"

Therefore, those who teach the Dharma in this way are able to liberate themselves and others.

## Verse 19

**Do not cover up, do not flatter, do not serve the ego, do not seek praise. A wise person does not engage in frivolous talk, nor does he boast about his blessings.**

This verse emphasizes the importance of humility and sincerity in teaching the Dharma. A true teacher does not seek to impress others or gain praise. They are focused on sharing the Dharma in a way that is beneficial to others.

Page #613:
---------------------------
Study of the text - When a Sadhu answers a question, he should not cover up the answer from the scriptures, nor hide it, nor interpret the scriptures based on an incorrect principle. He should not be proud, thinking of himself as a great scholar and ascetic. He should not boast about his virtues. If the listener does not understand the meaning he has explained, he should not ridicule him, and a Sadhu should not give blessings to anyone.
Commentary - Since the questioner may sometimes ask a question in a different way, the sutrakar prohibits this by saying - "Sa" - the questioner, being the refuge of all meanings, is like a casket of jewels, or like a market where all the goods of the three worlds are available, or he is an extraordinary scholar who knows everything, or he is one of the fourteen previous houses, or he is a brilliant scholar, knowledgeable in the meaning of things, due to some reason, even if he is angry with the listener, he should not cover up the meaning of the sutra, he should not explain it otherwise, nor should he speak ill of his teacher. While explaining the Dharma, he should not cover up the meaning of others' virtues, nor should he taint them, nor should he ridicule them, nor should he explain the meaning of the scriptures based on an incorrect principle. He should not be proud, thinking of himself as a knower of all scriptures, known to all, the destroyer of all doubts, there is no one like me who can explain the meaning of things with logic and reasoning. He should not boast about his vast knowledge and asceticism. The word "cha" indicates that he should avoid other forms of prestige, respect, and honor. A wise and learned Sadhu should not make jokes or fun. If for some reason the listener does not understand something, he should not ridicule him. He should not give blessings like "May you have many sons, may you have much wealth, may you have much virtue, may you live long". He should be consistent with his language and meaning.
Shadow - Being disgusted by the fear of ghosts, he should not perform the ritual of naming a child.
Human beings should not desire anything in the world, they should not speak of evil deeds.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra:

**Verse 20:**

A virtuous person should not give blessings to anyone out of fear of causing harm to living beings. They should not use mantras to make their restraint meaningless or distorted. They should not desire to obtain anything from people. They should not preach the religion of the wicked.

**Commentary:**

Why should a virtuous person not give blessings? The author of the sutra explains that a virtuous person, abhorring evil and sin, should not give blessings out of fear of causing harm to living beings. The term "Go-vani" refers to one who protects speech. Silence or restraint of speech is considered "Go-tra". A virtuous person should not make their restraint of speech meaningless or distorted by using mantras for the purpose of acquiring knowledge. Or, the term "Go-tra" can also refer to the life of living beings. A virtuous person should not use mantras, secret language, or advice to harm the life of living beings. This means that a virtuous person should not use mantras to harm living beings, even if it is done by a king or someone else. Similarly, a virtuous person should not desire any benefit, praise, or respect while preaching Dharma to people. They should not preach the religion of the wicked, which includes giving gifts, offering water, etc. They should not engage in conversations with those who preach wicked religions. They should not seek fame or praise for themselves while preaching Dharma. They should not desire their own praise or glory.

**Verse 21:**

A virtuous person should not engage in speech or bodily actions that cause laughter or make them appear ridiculous to others. A virtuous person should not speak of sinful Dharma even in jest, which causes suffering to others. A virtuous person, free from attachment and aversion, should not speak in a way that seeks praise or respect. They should remain free from the passions.

**Commentary:**

A virtuous person should not engage in speech or bodily actions that cause laughter or make them appear ridiculous to others. For example, they should not say things like "cut this" or "break this". They should not use words that are likely to cause laughter. For example, they should not say things like "your vows are beautiful". A virtuous person should not speak of sinful Dharma even in jest, which causes suffering to others. A virtuous person, free from attachment and aversion, should not speak in a way that seeks praise or respect. They should remain free from the passions.

---------------------------
Study of the scriptures - "A soft bed, a drink in the morning, food in the middle of the day, a drink in the afternoon, grapes and sugar at midnight, liberation at the end, as seen by the Sakya son." [1] Such statements, which are prone to fault-finding and are binding to sin, should not be spoken even in jest. Similarly, a 'Oja' (one who is free from attachment and aversion) should know, through the knowledge of knowing, that even though a statement is true in its essence, it is harsh if it disturbs the minds of others, and should discard it through the knowledge of rejection. Alternatively, a 'Oja' (one who is free from attachment and aversion) should know that 'Tathya' (truth) is truly real, unartificial, and not deceptive, and that 'Parusha' (harsh) is difficult to practice by those with little virtue due to the absence of karma-association, selflessness, or due to the consumption of food at the edge of the mouth. He should understand this 'Parusha-Samyama' (harsh restraint) through its practice. Similarly, knowing a particular meaning himself, or receiving honor and respect, he should not become 'Tuccha' (trivial) or go mad. He should not 'Vikaththayet' (boast) or praise himself, and not 'Vikaththayet' (boast) or excessively flatter others, not knowing them well. He should be 'Anakulo' (unperturbed) during the time of explanation or religious discourse, free from agitation, expectation of gain, etc., and always 'Akashaya' (free from passions). He is a 'Bhikshu' (monk) who is virtuous. [21]
Commentary - A monk should not speak any word that causes laughter to himself or others, that appears ridiculous to himself and others. He should not make the parts of his body engage in sinful activities. He should not make the activities of his mind, speech, and body careless. For example, he should not speak words like "cut this", "break this", etc. He should not mock the wrong speakers or those who hold different views. For example, he should not say, "Your vow is so beautiful", "Sleeping on a soft bed", "Drinking milk, etc., in the morning", "Eating rice, etc., at noon", "Drinking pan, asava, sharbat, thandai, etc., in the afternoon", "Eating grapes and mishri at midnight", "The Sakya son - Buddha - has shown such a good form of liberation", etc. He should not speak such things even in jest, knowing that they are binding to sin, as they expose the faults of others. A monk, free from attachment and aversion, should discard the external and internal knots, and even though a statement is true in its essence, it is harsh if it disturbs the minds of others, he should know it through the knowledge of knowing and discard it through the knowledge of rejection. Alternatively, a monk should accept the 'Oja' (virtue) being free from attachment and aversion. He should know that 'Tathya' (truth) is truly real, unartificial, and not deceptive, and that 'Parusha' (harsh) is difficult to practice by those with little virtue due to the absence of karma-association, selflessness, or due to the consumption of food at the edge of the mouth. He should understand this 'Parusha-Samyama' (harsh restraint) through its practice. A monk should not become 'Tuccha' (trivial) or go mad, knowing a particular meaning himself, or receiving honor and respect. He should not praise himself or excessively flatter others, not knowing them well. He should be 'Anakulo' (unperturbed) during the time of explanation or religious discourse, free from agitation, expectation of gain, etc., and always 'Akashaya' (free from passions). He is a 'Bhikshu' (monk) who is virtuous. [21]
Commentary - A monk should be free from doubt and fear, and should speak in a way that is impartial. He should speak both languages, arising from Dharma, with impartiality and wisdom. [22]

The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra Translation - Even if one has no doubt regarding the sutra and its meaning, one should speak in a way that suggests doubt. When speaking about Dharma, one should use language based on the principles of Vibhajya-vada (analysis) and Syadvada (conditionalism). While associating with virtuous individuals who are engaged in Dharma, one should use two types of language: Satya-bhasa (truthful language) and Amithya-bhasa (non-false language). One should teach Dharma equally to both the wealthy and the poor.

Commentary - The author now discusses the method of discourse. A virtuous individual, while delivering a discourse, even if certain about the meaning, should speak in a way that suggests doubt due to the possibility of misunderstanding. One should avoid arrogance and not claim to be the sole knower of the truth. Instead, one should explain the subject matter with a sense of doubt. Even if the meaning is clear and certain, one should not speak in a way that creates doubt in the listener's mind. One should explain things using Vibhajya-vada, which involves analyzing and explaining things separately. Vibhajya-vada is synonymous with Syadvada, which is a universal principle that is never contradicted by worldly experience. It is universally applicable and validated by personal experience. One should use this principle in discourse. Alternatively, one should explain things clearly and separately. For example, one should explain the concept of permanence (nitya-vada) from the perspective of the substance (dravya) and the concept of impermanence (anitya-vada) from the perspective of the category (paryaya). All things exist from the perspective of their own substance, field, time, and mode, but they do not exist from the perspective of other substances, fields, times, and modes. As it is said:

"Who would not accept that everything is real from the perspective of its own nature and the four categories? It is only through misinterpretation that things appear unreal. Otherwise, they would not exist."

Thus, one should speak using Vibhajya-vada. One should also explain Vibhajya-vada using two types of language. The author states that one should use both truthful and non-false language. When asked or not asked, one should use these two types of language during Dharma discussions or at other times. What kind of person should one be? One should be a virtuous individual who is engaged in the practice of right conduct and not a hypocrite who is merely pretending to be virtuous. One should associate with virtuous individuals who are truly engaged in Dharma and not with those who are merely pretending. One should be like a righteous king or a virtuous person, free from attachment and aversion, and use both types of language while teaching Dharma.

---------------------------
When asked, or not asked, or during a religious story or discourse, or at any other time, the sadhu should use the two languages of truth and untruth, and the two languages of amr̥ṣā (conduct). How should the sadhu do this? The sūtra-kāra says in this context: The sadhu, who is established in sat-samyama, the highest practice of restraint, who is udya-t, diligent, who is udya-t vihāra-śīla, diligent in his conduct, who is udāyī, like a king who is a māra-ka, a destroyer, who is not like a deceitful or cunning person, who is vihāra-śīla with the munis, who is free from attachment and aversion, who is endowed with excellent wisdom, should, relying on the two languages mentioned above, teach the cakravartī and the pauper equally.

"When one follows the wrong path, one should know it, and the sadhu should speak gently. He should not speak a language that is hurtful, nor should he speak in a way that is too long or too short." (23)

Commentary: When the sadhu speaks in these two languages, some intelligent people understand the meaning of what the ācārya and others have said, but others, because of their dull intellect, understand it differently. The sadhu should try to make those who understand it differently understand it correctly, using gentle words, and not using harsh words like "You are a fool," "You are stubborn," etc. He should not speak in a way that is disrespectful, with angry expressions on his face, hands, mouth, or eyes, which would cause pain to the person in front of him. He should not criticize the language of the questioner. He should not explain a short meaning in a long way.

"The meaning should be spoken in a few words. If a few words are spoken in many words, it becomes meaningless." (1)

The sūtra is short and the meaning is small, etc. In the four-fold classification, the one that is short and has a great meaning is praised here. (23)

Commentary: The author of the scripture says that when he speaks in the two languages mentioned above, some people, because of their intelligence, understand the meaning of what the ācārya and others have said, but others, because of their dull intellect, understand it differently. The sadhu should try to make those who understand it differently understand it correctly, using appropriate reasons, examples, and arguments, so that they understand, but not by calling them a fool, stubborn, or dull. He should not speak in a way that is disrespectful, with angry expressions on his face, hands, mouth, or eyes, which would cause pain to the person in front of him. He should not criticize the language of the questioner. He should not explain a short meaning in a long way.

Page #618:
---------------------------
Do not criticize him with harsh and severe words like "He is like zero" etc. Explain it to him in a suitable way as he can understand. He should not insult him with gestures of anger, hands, lips and eyes. The virtuous person should not cause pain in the mind of that person. If the language of that questioner is contaminated with defects like abusive words etc., do not despise him by saying "You are a fool, uncultured, you are cursed, uncultured, and zero in the past and future, what is the benefit of your statement?" etc. And do not ridicule the questioner by accusing him of incoherent speech. And do not explain a small or concise meaning with long, long sentences full of wordy embellishments like "ark vitapikaasthika" instead of calling it "a piece of wood". Do not make a short lecture or discussion long by introducing grammar, logic, etc., by obtaining or not obtaining. It has been said - "That which can be said in a few words is the right thing to say." If a meaning is small but is expressed in many words, it is useless and devoid of essence. Some sutras are short and some are small in meaning. In this regard, there is a four-fold classification. The one which is short in words and great in meaning is commendable.

The study of scriptures, I have done my duty, but to explain the profound meaning worthy of knowing, according to the listener's ability, with the best purpose and reasoning, etc., should be explained completely.  A sadhu, while imparting such a subject, should speak clearly, without any hesitation or slip-ups, distinctly, without mixing or separating, without omitting any letter, and should be a complete speaker of the meaning, explaining the meaning in detail.  Having heard the substance and essence from the Acharya, etc., and having understood its meaning correctly, knowing the meaning received and understood from the Guru well, he should use pure words, according to the Agamas ordained by the omniscient, without contradiction, without opposition, without fault, without sin, and without any flaw.  He should speak words according to the principle of renunciation and the subject of exceptions, according to the principle of exceptions, and according to his own principles and the principles of others.  Thus, while using speech with awareness of sin, the sadhu should not desire gain, honor, etc., and should have the intention of speaking faultless words.

Then, authorizing the method of language, the Sutrakar says:

**Ahabhuiai susikkhaejja, jaijjaaya naativelam vadejja. Se dittthimang dittthi na luusaejja, se jaanai bhaasiuung tam samahim.** ||25||

**Shadow:**  Yathoktani: Sushikset, yatet naativelam vadet.
Sa drishtiman drishtim na looshayet, sa janatibhasitum tam samadim. ||

**Translation:**  The sadhu should always practice the words of the Tirthankaras and the Ganadharas, etc., great men, and should be conduct-oriented accordingly.  He should not speak excessively, transgressing the limits.  The right vision should not corrupt or taint the right vision, the right perception.  He knows the state of samadhi, the path to liberation, as taught by the omniscient Tirthankaras.

**Commentary:**  Yathoktani, those spoken by the Tirthankaras, Ganadharas, etc., should be practiced by the sadhu day and night.  He should correctly grasp the Agamas ordained by the omniscient through the teaching of grasping.  Through the teaching of practice, he should be engaged in virtuous conduct and practice.  He should also teach others in the same way.  To avoid the characteristics of excessive attachment, it is advised that he should always strive for the teaching of grasping and practice.  Even though he is always striving, he should not speak excessively, exceeding the time for his duty or the time for study.  He should not exceed the limits of study and duty.  He should proceed towards the ten observances.  He should perform all actions according to the occasion, without hindering each other.  Such a virtuous person, who speaks according to the time and acts according to the time, is a "Samyak Drishtiman," who has faith in the established objects, and while giving a discourse or explanation, he should not corrupt or taint "Drishti," the right perception.  This is said:  Knowing the particular person, he should speak accordingly, avoiding the teaching of false doctrines, so that the listener's rightness is established, and not corrupted by the generation of doubts.  And such a person "knows," understands, "to speak," to formulate, "samadhi," the right perception, knowledge, and conduct, or the right mental state, the samadhi spoken by the omniscient. ||25||

**Commentary Meaning:**  The sadhu should diligently practice the words taught by the Tirthankaras, Ganadharas, etc., great men.  He should correctly grasp and assimilate the Agamas ordained by the omniscient through the teaching of grasping.  Through the teaching of practice, he should strive to observe restraint.  He should also teach others the Agamas.  Inappropriate, undesirable...

- The Sutra of the Sri Sutra Kritanga. To eliminate the characteristics, one should do this. He should always be diligent in preaching Dharma, being endowed with the teachings of acceptance and service. While making such an effort, he should not violate the time for that work or the time for study. He should not transgress the limits of study and duty, but remain engaged in good conduct. There should be no mutual hindrance. He should act keeping this in mind. He should perform all actions according to the occasion. A sage who speaks or acts according to time or occasion, has right faith, i.e., he has faith in the true nature of things. While preaching Dharma or giving lectures, he should not corrupt right faith. This means that knowing the particular person, seeing his ability, he should avoid wrong doctrines and preach in such a way that the listener's right faith remains stable, but he should not preach in such a way that it creates doubt in the listener's mind and corrupts his right faith. One who knows how to preach in this way, knows well the right faith, knowledge, conduct, and the state of samadhi, which is the right mind, established by the omniscient.

He should not conceal the doctrines of the scriptures. A sage, the protector of the three worlds, should not misinterpret the scriptures and their meaning. He should not speak words contrary to them. Contemplating the devotion to the teacher, the one who gives teachings, he should speak thoughtfully. He should present the teachings as he heard them from the teacher.

Teekaarth - A sage, while explaining the scriptures revealed by the omniscient, should not corrupt the scriptures by presenting doctrines contrary to them. He should not conceal the doctrines that are not contradictory to the scriptures, are pure, and are meant for the public, by speaking in a veiled manner. Or, he should not speak about a secret doctrine to an unprepared person, for that would lead to the destruction of the unprepared disciple and would only be harmful. And it has been said:
"The presentation of the truth of the scriptures to a mind that is not calm. It is like a new fire in a disease, which needs to be calmed down. ||1||"
etc. And he should not make himself or others a protector of the scriptures or their meaning by making a different interpretation. Or, he should not do anything that would make the beings who are seeking liberation from the cycle of birth and death, a protector of the scriptures or their meaning. Why? Because it is not right to do anything other than the scriptures. He says, "For the sake of others, the teacher, in whom there is devotion to the scriptures, which is established by the scriptures, should contemplate that devotion with respect, and should not speak in such a way that it would ever contradict the scriptures. Thus, after considering everything, he should speak. And whatever he has heard from the teachers, he should present it in the same way, following the path of right faith, and liberating others from their debts. He should not think that it is easy to present the teachings, and should not remain indifferent in any way. ||26||

The study of the text,
should not be given to an uninitiated, immature man, because revealing the secrets of the principles to such a man will corrupt and distort him. Therefore, it is said that it is a fault to reveal the harmony and excellence of the scriptures to one whose mind is restless - especially not peaceful. Just as it is a fault to give medicine to stop fever to someone who has a new fever - who has just developed a fever, etc. The virtuous, who are self-reliant and protect others, or who protect beings, should not distort the sutra and its meaning by arbitrary imagination - should not make it contrary. Why should he not distort the sutra? Explaining this, the sutra-maker says that the virtuous, who are engaged in the welfare of others, should contemplate the devotion and respect they have for the teacher, the preacher, and think that my statement does not create any obstacle in the scriptures. Then he should speak his words. He should follow the practice of the worship of rightness according to what he has heard from the Acharya, etc., and make the same representation to be free from the debt of the guru. He should not think of his own comfort and convenience, and should not speak in any way that he likes. He should not speak as his mind desires.

-
He who finds the pure sutra, the vow, and the dharma, there and there.
,
The skillful, clear, introductory statement, he deserves to speak that concentration. || I say. ||
Translation - The virtuous who pronounce the pure sutra, who perform the austerities prescribed by the scriptures, who adopt the dharma based on renunciation in place of renunciation, and the dharma based on exception in place of exception, are the introductory statement. His words are to be accepted - thus, the skillful and clear-thinking virtuous, omniscient, who are active in the meaning of the scriptures, can expound the concentration of the feeling, as conceived by the omniscient.
Commentary - To conclude the study, it is said - 'He' who is the creator of the scriptures as they are, who speaks after contemplation, who does not corrupt the right view, who presents the objects as they are, who has the pure sutra, the pure pronunciation, the vow, the performance of austerities, which is prescribed for the sutra, if it exists in the scriptures, he is the vow-taker, and 'dharma' - the dharma called the heard conduct, whoever knows it correctly, or finds it correctly, obtains it, 'there and there' - the meaning which is to be accepted by command, should be accepted by command only. The reason is that if the meaning is established in one's own time, it should be established in one's own time, and if the meaning is established in another's time, it should be established in another's time, or the meaning established in renunciation and exception should be presented accordingly. He who is endowed with these qualities is the 'introductory statement' - the acceptable statement. Similarly, 'skillful' - skilled in presenting the scriptures and in performing them correctly, 'clear' - clear, not a doubter, and whoever is endowed with these qualities is 'worthy' - fit to 'speak' - to expound 'that' - the omniscient's words, knowledge, etc., or the concentration of feeling, and no one else. Thus, for the purpose of concluding, I say, as before, the path is followed, the principles are to be explained as before. ||27||
॥ The study called the fourteenth text is complete. ॥
Commentary - The sutra-maker concludes this study by saying - the virtuous who do not corrupt the right view, who present the meaning of the scriptures as they are, who speak after contemplation,

---------------------------
The Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra states that the essence of a substance is its pure form, as it is. One who recites and expounds the Sutra with study and contemplation, who performs the austerities prescribed by the scriptures, who diligently observes the pure, character-based Dharma, who accepts the meaning that is to be understood by command, simply by command, who accepts the meaning that is to be understood by reason, with reason, who establishes what is proven in one's own doctrine within one's own doctrine, and who establishes what is proven in another doctrine within another doctrine. One who establishes the meaning based on the general principle in the general form and the meaning based on the exception in the exceptional form. One who possesses these qualities, who is endowed with these characteristics, is the one whose words are worthy of acceptance. One who is proficient in the exposition of the scriptures and in virtuous conduct, who does not act without careful consideration and review, who is endowed with these qualities, is the only one who can speak and discuss the knowledge, etc., as exemplified by the omniscient, or the state of meditative absorption. Here, the word "iti" signifies completion. I speak, as before. The commentary is complete. The Nay is to be explained as before.
The fourteenth chapter of the study is complete.

The translation: Those who have destroyed the karma of Darshanavaran, who are the protectors of all beings, and who are the guides of all, know all that has been, is, and will be.
They know what is to come. Therefore, they have destroyed the Darshanavaran. ||1||
-
The leader knows all that has been, is, and will be. He is the protector, the destroyer of the Darshanavaran. ||
Commentary: This sutra is related to the previous sutra. The previous sutra says that the man who is Adeyavakya, skillful, and articulate, is worthy of speaking about Samadhi, and that only he who knows all that has been, is, and will be is worthy of speaking, not anyone else. The relationship with the previous sutra is that the one who knows the three times of past, present, and future is the knower of all bonds and the destroyer of them. This should be understood. Similarly, the relationship with other sutras should be established by one's own intelligence. The explanation of this sutra, whose relationship has been established, is presented. Whatever kind of substance is in the past, whatever is present, and whatever is in the future - the future time - he is the 'leader' of all of them, the one who knows their true nature. The knowledge of the true nature of things is possible only when there is knowledge. Therefore, the sutra says that he knows all, the past, present, and future, the four substances, and the substance-related and synonymous naya. He knows, understands, and understands all this. Knowing this, he is the protector of all beings, the one who saves them from the cycle of birth and death, by giving special instructions. The word 'trayi' comes from the root 'tay', which means 'to protect'. He is the one who protects all beings. He knows all the paths, all the knowledge. He is the one who knows everything, the one who sees everything. And, no effect can happen without a cause. Therefore, the sutra says that he is the destroyer of the karma of Darshanavaran. It should be understood that he is not the destroyer of the four types of karma. ||1||

---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** takes one across the ocean of worldly existence. Therefore, it is the savior of all, the protector of all. According to grammar, the word "tayanam" is formed by adding the suffix "ghan" to the root "tay" which means "traan" (salvation). The one who provides salvation is called "trayi" (savior). According to the principle "Sarvegatyartha jnanartha", all verbs that denote motion also denote knowledge. Knowledge leads to the delimitation of the general. The word "manutte" refers to a specific person who is the knower of all, the omniscient, the all-seeing. Without a cause, an effect cannot be produced. Therefore, the author of the sutra states that this person is the destroyer of the "darshanavaraneya karma" (karma that obscures perception). It should be understood that through the destruction of "darshanavaraneya karma", he destroys the four types of "ghati karma" (karma that leads to rebirth).

1. **Antae vitigicchaae, se jaanati aneli-sam. Aneli-sass akkhaaya, na se hoi tahim tahim.** ||2||
**Chhaya antako vichikit-saayaah, sa jaanatyaneedrusham. Aneedrusha-syaakhyata, sa na bhavati tatra tatra.** ||
-
**Translation:** The one who is the destroyer of doubt, the one who is not doubtful, is the "aneedrusha" (unparalleled) knower. Such a commentator, the explainer of the truth of things, does not exist in other philosophies.

**Commentary:** The one who is the destroyer of the four types of "ghati karma" is described as follows: "Vitigicchaa" refers to mental confusion, doubt, and uncertainty. The one who destroys this is the one who has destroyed the veil of perception, and thus has no doubt, delusion, or false knowledge. This is stated because the destruction of the veil of perception is mentioned, and it is stated that "darshan" (philosophy) is different from knowledge. Therefore, the assumption that there is only one knowledge of the omniscient, which is capable of delimiting both the general and the specific, is refuted by the separate mention of the destruction of the veil. The one who destroys "ghati karma" and has knowledge that transcends doubt, etc., is "aneedrusha" (unparalleled). There is no one equal to him in delimiting the general and the specific aspects of the objects of knowledge. This is stated because his knowledge is not equal to the knowledge of others. Therefore, what the Mimamsakas say - that if it is assumed that the omniscient is the delimiter of all objects, then he would also have to experience the delimitation of touch, taste, smell, color, and sound, and thus would also have to experience the taste of the desired object - is refuted by this. Also, it is said that even if the omniscient exists in general, the absence of other causes would not lead to the proper understanding of the object. Thus, it is said:

"Arha (ruha) n yadisarvagno, buddho netyatra ka prabha? | Athobhava-pi sarvagnau, matabhedastayo: katham? ||1||"

And so on. To refute this, it is said: "Aneedrusha-sya" (unparalleled) - the one who is the delimiter of this, is not found in "tatra tatra" (there and there) - in philosophies like Buddhism, etc. This is because they do not accept the existence of substance and its modifications. For example, Shakyamuni believes that everything is momentary and accepts only modifications, not substance. If there is no substance, then the absence of modifications would follow, because they are seedless. Therefore, even if one does not accept modifications, one must accept the substance that is the basis of modifications. Since they do not accept this, they are not omniscient. Similarly, Kapila is not omniscient because he accepts only one substance, which is unchanging, unproduced, and stable, and does not accept modifications, which are active and capable of action because they are dependent on the substance. Similarly, Uluka is not omniscient because he accepts the difference between substance and modification, like milk and water, which are not different. Since they are not omniscient, there is no one among the other "tirthankaras" who is "aneedrusha" (unparalleled) - the one who is the delimiter of both substance and modification. Therefore, only the "arhan" (the liberated one) is the knower of the substance, which exists in all three times - past, present, and future. Therefore, he is not found "tatra tatra" (there and there). ||2||

The study called Adana is a commentary on the sutra - the one who is the destroyer of the four types of karmas is of this nature - this is what the sutra-maker states. The instability or doubtful knowledge of the mind is called vichikittsa. The one who destroys doubt due to the weakening of the karmas that cover it, is present in the end of doubt, viparyaya and mithya-jnana, because he knows them in their true form. This means that the destruction of darshanavaraneya karma is being stated here. Therefore, it is clear that darshan is different from knowledge. Those who believe that the knowledge of the omniscient is one and is endowed with inconceivable power. Therefore, he is the determiner of both the general and the specific aspects of matter. It should be known that by stating the separate destruction of darshanavaraneya, the aforementioned opinion is refuted. The one who has destroyed the karmas, has overcome doubt etc., is the unparalleled knower of things. No one else is the knower of both the general and the specific aspects of things. The meaning is that the knowledge of that person is not like the knowledge of others. Therefore, what the Mimamsakas have said, that the omniscient has the knowledge of all things, should also have the knowledge of the taste of an unaccepted object, because the knowledge of touch, taste, smell, color and sound remains. This is refuted by this statement - it should be known. They have said so. Even if the omniscient is proven in general, there is no reason to prove that only he is the omniscient. Therefore, this statement does not create understanding. They have also said - if the Arhat is omniscient, the Buddha is not omniscient, what is the proof? If both the Arhat and the Buddha are omniscient, then why is there a difference in their principles? While refuting this accusation, they say - the Arhat is the narrator or presenter of things in an unparalleled way, the Buddha is not like that because in Buddhism and other philosophies, both dravya and paryaya are not accepted. Shakyamuni Buddha considers all things to be momentary, accordingly they accept only paryaya. They do not accept dravya, but without dravya there is no seedlessness - dravya is the seed form of paryaya, without them, paryaya cannot exist. Therefore, those who believe in paryaya must accept the underlying, changing dravya of paryaya. Buddha does not accept this. Therefore, they are not omniscient. Kapil accepts only the unchanging, indestructible, uncreated, unproduced, stable, one-natured dravya. They do not believe in the directly experienced, meaning-action-capable paryaya, but paryaya-less dravya cannot exist. Therefore, Kapil is also not omniscient. Just as milk and water are inseparable as dravya and paryaya. The omniscience of the owl, who considers them completely different, is also not proven. Thus, due to being non-omniscient, none of the other philosophers are the narrator or presenter of the dravya-paryaya-filled matter, like the unparalleled Arhat. Therefore, it is proven that only the Arhat is the best narrator, the best explainer of the past, future and present - trikala things, in their true form.
Therefore, therefore, you should speak well, you should speak truly. Being endowed with truth, you should make friends with many. ||3||

**The Sutra of the Sutra-Kritanga**

**Shadow:** It has been declared in various places, and that which is declared is truth.
**Translation:** The omniscient Tirthankaras have declared the principles of the soul and other entities in different places and contexts. Their correct analysis and explanation is eternal truth. Therefore, humans should always be filled with this truth and cultivate compassion towards all beings.

**Commentary:** The present verse aims to demonstrate the omniscience of the Arhats, as it is possible. The word "tatra tatra" (there, there) is used in a sense of emphasis. The Arhats have explained the nature of the soul, non-soul, and other entities, as well as the causes of bondage, such as false belief, non-restraint, carelessness, and passions. They have also explained the path to liberation, which consists of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct. All of this is consistent and logical, and therefore it is declared as truth. The teachings of other sects, however, are not true. They say, "Do not harm living beings," but they also permit actions that lead to the oppression and harm of living beings. Their teachings are contradictory. Therefore, their teachings are not true. The truth is that which is declared by those who know the true nature of things. Passions are the cause of falsehood, and they are absent in the omniscient. Therefore, due to the absence of the cause, there is no effect. Their words are the true representation of reality. As it is said:

"The omniscient are free from passions, they do not speak falsehood. Therefore, their words are the true representation of reality."

**Objection:** Even without omniscience, one can still speak the truth by knowing only what is beneficial and harmful. As it is said:

"Whether one sees everything or not, one should see what is beneficial. What is the use of knowing the number of insects?"

**Answer:** The verse says, "Always" (sada) filled with "truth" (satyena), meaning always speaking the truth. This is possible only with omniscience, not otherwise. If one does not know the number of insects, then one may doubt their knowledge of everything. As it is said:

"If there is a possibility of contradiction in similar things, then the characteristic itself is faulty."

Therefore, one should believe in the omniscience of the Tirthankaras. Otherwise, their words would not always be true. The Tirthankaras are always filled with truth and restraint. They are compassionate towards all living beings. Therefore, they cultivate compassion towards all beings. This is what is meant by the verse:

"The omniscient, who sees the truth, cultivates compassion towards all beings."

As it is said:

"One who sees all beings as oneself, sees truly."

**Commentary:** Those who hold other views are not omniscient. Omniscience is present only in the Arhats. The author of the sutra explains this logically. The word "tatra tatra" (there, there) is used twice in the verse for emphasis. According to this, the Tirthankaras have explained the nature of the soul, non-soul, and other entities. They have also explained the causes of bondage, such as false belief, non-restraint, carelessness, and passions. They have also explained the path to liberation, which consists of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct. All of this is consistent and logical, and therefore it is declared as truth. Other sects, however, say, "Do not harm living beings," but they also permit actions that lead to the oppression and harm of living beings. Their teachings are contradictory. Therefore, their teachings are not true. The truth is that which is declared by those who know the true nature of things. Passions are the cause of falsehood, and they are absent in the omniscient. Therefore, due to the absence of the cause, there is no effect. Their words are the true representation of reality. As it is said:

"The omniscient are free from passions, they do not speak falsehood. Therefore, their words are the true representation of reality."

**Objection:** Even without omniscience, one can still speak the truth by knowing only what is beneficial and harmful. As it is said:

"Whether one sees everything or not, one should see what is beneficial. What is the use of knowing the number of insects?"

**Answer:** The verse says, "Always" (sada) filled with "truth" (satyena), meaning always speaking the truth. This is possible only with omniscience, not otherwise. If one does not know the number of insects, then one may doubt their knowledge of everything. As it is said:

"If there is a possibility of contradiction in similar things, then the characteristic itself is faulty."

Therefore, one should believe in the omniscience of the Tirthankaras. Otherwise, their words would not always be true. The Tirthankaras are always filled with truth and restraint. They are compassionate towards all living beings. Therefore, they cultivate compassion towards all beings. This is what is meant by the verse:

"The omniscient, who sees the truth, cultivates compassion towards all beings."

As it is said:

"One who sees all beings as oneself, sees truly."

---------------------------
The study called "Adana" is absent in the Siddhas. Therefore, their statement is not well-explained, proper, or faultless. The Tirthankara Devas are the explainers of the right Dharma, which is free from contradictions, because they are free from attachment, aversion, and delusion, which are the causes of false speech. What is beneficial to all is called truth, and that is well-explained. Those who know its nature have established it. Attachment, etc., are the causes of false speech, and they do not exist in the Tirthankara Devas. Therefore, in the absence of the cause, there is an absence of the effect. Therefore, their words are the indicators of the true nature of the object, the explainer of the past reality. It is said, "The Vitaragas are omniscient, they do not speak falsely." Therefore, their words are the indicators and explainers of the true nature of the truth and the object. Here, a doubt arises: even without omniscience, truth is established merely by the knowledge of the object that is to be abandoned and the object that is to be taken. Therefore, it is said, "Whether a man sees everything or not, but if he sees the desired meaning, that is sufficient." What is the use of knowing the number of insects for them and for us? To this, the Sutrakar says, "The Tirthankaras are always endowed with truthful speech - they speak the truth." Omniscience is the only way to have truthful speech, otherwise it is not possible. That is, only omniscients can speak the truth, because if there is ignorance of the number of insects - lack of knowledge - then there is a fear of ignorance - lack of knowledge - in all objects everywhere. Therefore, it is said, "Just as knowledge is obstructed in one place, it can be obstructed in other places as well." In this way, truthfulness everywhere will be unreliable, it will not be reliable anywhere. Therefore, only the omniscience of the Tirthankara Devas is acceptable, otherwise, if it is not accepted, their words cannot always be true. Or, the meaning of truth is also restraint. The word "Sat" also refers to a being, and what is beneficial to them is truth. In this way, the Tirthankara Devas, who are always endowed with restraint, which is beneficial to such beings who are primarily engaged in penance, establish friendship among beings. Due to their protection of beings, they inspire compassion for all beings - they give such teachings. The point is that they are truly omniscient, who, due to their insight into reality, create the concept of friendship among beings. Therefore, it is said, "He who considers other women as mothers, the wealth of others as stones, and all beings as equal to himself, is truly the one who sees reality."
"They do not oppose beings, this is the Dharma of the virtuous. The virtuous one knows the nature of the world, he has the feeling of life in him."
Translation: "One should not have opposition or enmity towards beings - creatures. This is the Dharma of the virtuous. He knows the nature of the world and is imbued with the feeling of pure Dharma."
Commentary: "Just as he experiences complete friendship towards beings, and to show that, he says, 'They do not oppose beings' - stationary and mobile beings - 'they should not do anything that harms them', 'they should avoid the cause of opposition to them from afar', that is the meaning. 'This' - the one mentioned later - 'Dharma' - nature or virtue - 'Busimao' - this is the Tirthankara, who is endowed with good restraint. And the virtuous Tirthankara, who is endowed with good restraint..."

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra:

**The 'Jagat'**, a collection of all living and non-living beings, is fully understood through the **Kevala Jnana** (omniscience) of the **Sarvagna** (omniscient). By understanding this 'Jagat' through the **Gama Parijnana** (knowledge of the scriptures) or by **Parijnaya** (direct knowledge), one should cultivate the **twenty-five types of Dharma Bhavanas** (virtuous thoughts) or the **twelve types of Bhavanas** which are **Jivit Bhavanas** (life-sustaining), **Jiva Samadhan Karini** (soul-liberating), **Sat Samyama Angataya** (parts of right restraint), and **Moksha Karini** (liberation-producing). ||4||

**To explain the state of one who has cultivated these virtuous thoughts, the Sutrakar says:**

**Commentary:**

The Sutrakar explains that one should cultivate **Maitri Bhava** (loving-kindness) towards all beings. One should avoid any actions that cause harm or violence towards living beings. One should avoid any actions that lead to conflict with other beings. This is the pure and holy nature of the **Tirthankara** (liberated soul) or the conduct of a **Susanyami Sadhu** (perfectly restrained sage).

A **Susanyami Sadhu** or a **Tirthankara**, through **Kevala Jnana** or **Sarvagna**-revealed **Agam Jnana** (scriptural knowledge), fully understands the **Jagat** (universe) of living and non-living beings. In this world, they cultivate the **twenty-five** or **twelve types of Bhavanas** which are **Jivit Bhavanas**, **Jiva Samadhan Karini**, **Sat Samyama Angataya**, and **Moksha Karini**.

**To show the state of a person who has cultivated these virtuous thoughts, the Sutrakar says:**

**Bhavanajogasuddhapya, jale nava va ahiya. Nava va tirasampanna, savvadukkha tiutt'ai. ||5||**

**Chhaya:**

**Bhavanayogasuddhatma, jale naurivahita. Nauriva tira sampanna, sarvadukhat trutayati. ||5||**

**Translation:**

The soul purified by the **Bhavanayoga** (yoga of virtuous thoughts) is like a boat in water. Just as a boat reaches the shore and finds rest, so too does this person become free from all suffering.

**Commentary:**

**Bhavanayoga** is the practice of cultivating virtuous thoughts with **Samyak Pranidhana** (right resolve). The soul of one who has purified their inner self through **Bhavanayoga** is like a boat on water, having renounced the worldly desires. Just as a boat never sinks in water, so too does this person never sink in the ocean of Samsara (cycle of birth and death). Just as a boat, guided by a skilled navigator and propelled by favorable winds, reaches the shore after overcoming all obstacles, so too does a person with **Ayata Charitra** (right conduct), guided by the **Agam** (scriptural teachings) and propelled by the wind of **Tapa** (austerity), reaches the shore of **Moksha** (liberation) after overcoming all suffering. ||5||

The study called Adana, guided by the supreme Agamas and propelled by the wind of austerity, escapes - departs - from the world of suffering. It attains the arrow of liberation where all dualities and sorrows cease - end - or are absent.

Thus, knowing the world or karma, he does not create new karma, and for him, whose doors of inflow are closed, who has performed excellent austerity, the previously accumulated karma is destroyed, or ceases, and by not creating new karma, all karma is destroyed. || 6 ||

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra

**Commentary:** Some argue that even after the complete destruction of karma and attainment of liberation, one may return to the cycle of birth and death upon witnessing the rejection of their own Tirtha (religious sect). To address this doubt, the Sutra-kar (author of the Sutra) states:

The liberated soul, devoid of all actions, has no cause for any new karma to arise, such as knowledge-obscuring karma, etc. This is because the absence of a cause leads to the absence of an effect. Without karma, how can there be a return to the cycle of birth and death? Samsara (the cycle of birth and death) is the effect of karma. Since the liberated soul is free from all dualities, there is no possibility of attachment or aversion, and hence no inclination towards rejecting their own Tirtha. Such a liberated soul understands the eight types of karma, their causes, and their effects. They also understand the destruction of karma and the nature of karma-destroying actions. They understand the difference between karma and its name, as well as the nature, state, experience, and domain of karma. The term "name" here refers to the possibility of understanding karma. Knowing the knowledge of karma, its bondage, and the means of its destruction, the Mahavir (the great hero) is capable of destroying karma. By doing so, they are not reborn in the cycle of birth and death, and hence do not die. They are not defined as belonging to a particular hell or animal realm. This is because the absence of a cause leads to the absence of samsara.

Therefore, the statement "He possesses unwavering knowledge, detachment, power, and righteousness, all four being inherently present in the Lord of the world" is refuted. This is because the liberated soul, having understood the nature of samsara, eliminates it. There is no inherent, self-existent being. This is because there is no logical argument to support such a claim.

---------------------------
The study called "Adana" does not apply to the great Mahavira, for whom there is no past karma. Just as the wind transcends the flames of fire, so too does this powerful soul transcend the allure of women in the world.

Page #632:
---------------------------
## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra - Freed from the Bondage of Desire

**The one who is filled with the fruits of his actions is forever freed from them.** For birth, old age, and death are only for those who have accumulated karma over hundreds of births. But the soul who has conquered himself, who has blocked the doors of inflow, and who has no remaining karma, is not subject to birth, old age, or death. He is forever free because he has stopped the inflow.

**Among the inflows, the most prominent is the attachment to women.** Therefore, the Sutrakar emphasizes it, saying: Just as the wind, constantly moving, flowing without stopping, overcomes the flames of fire, so too does the soul who has conquered himself overcome women in the human world. He is not bound by them because he understands their nature and knows the fruit of conquering them.

**It is said that women bind men through their smiles, gestures, glances, coquetry, pride, shyness, averted gazes, half-glances, speech, jealousy, quarrels, and playful banter.** They cause division between brothers and relatives. Many kings, driven by insatiable desire, have waged wars for women, leading to the destruction of their dynasties.

**By understanding the nature of women, the soul who has conquered himself overcomes them.** He is not conquered by them.

**Here, a doubt arises: Why is the inflow of attachment to women emphasized, and not the other inflows like violence? Why are the other inflows not indicated through the example of violence?**

**The answer is:** Some philosophers do not consider sexual indulgence to be an inflow. They argue that eating meat, drinking alcohol, and sexual indulgence are natural tendencies, but abstaining from them is highly beneficial. To refute this view, the inflow of attachment to women is presented. It indicates all other inflows.

**Alternatively, the religion of the Tirthankaras between the first and last Tirthankara was based on the four vows, but in the time of Mahavira, the religion is based on the five vows.** This is why the attachment to women is mentioned here.

**Or, the other vows are flawed, but this vow is flawless.** This is why the attachment to women, the fourth inflow, is taken as an example.

**Or, all vows are equal.** If one is refuted, all are refuted. Therefore, there is no fault in taking any one as an example.

**To show the fruit of stopping the inflow of attachment to women, the Sutrakar says:**

**"Those who do not indulge in women, they are the ones who are liberated. They are free from bondage and do not desire life."** (Sutra Kritanga Sutra 9)

**Commentary:** Those who do not indulge in women, they are the ones who are liberated. They are free from bondage and do not desire life.

---------------------------
Adananamaka Study Translation - Those men who do not engage with women, who are Brahmachari, are the first to attain liberation (Adimoksha). Those who are free from bondage do not desire a life of non-restraint (Asanyama).

Commentary - These great souls (Mahasattva) understand that engaging with women is a cause of bitter consequences (katuvipaka). Women are obstacles (argala) on the path to liberation, they are the cause of wandering in the world (sansaravithi). They are the capitals of unrestraint (avinya), filled with hundreds of deceitful traps (kapatajala). They possess great power to enchant (mahamohanshakti). Therefore, those who do not desire to engage with them are superior to others. They are virtuous (sadhu) and attain liberation first (adimoksha). They are free from all dualities (dwandva). Here, the word 'hu' is used in the sense of understanding. Accordingly, such men should be understood as those who attain liberation first (adimoksha). This means that those who have abandoned all forms of unrestraint (avinya) and the cause of such unrestraint, which is engaging with women, are dedicated to achieving the ultimate goal of liberation (moksha). Here, the word 'adi' signifies the primary (pradhana). Accordingly, these men are not only dedicated but also free from the bondage of women (stripaashabandhana) and therefore free from all karmic bondage (karmabandhana). They do not desire a life of non-restraint (asanyama) or anything else like possessions (parigraha). Or, they have abandoned the desire for worldly pleasures and are dedicated to virtuous conduct (sadanushthana). These men, who are absorbed in liberation (moksha), do not desire to live for a long time (dirghakala).

Life (jivitam) is a burden (piththo), they attain the end of karma (kammuna). Those who are confronted with karma (kammuna) are guided by the path (maggamanusasai).

Shadow - Having made life (jivitam) secondary (piththata), they attain the end of karma (kammuna).
Those who are confronted with karma (kammuna) are guided by the path (maggamanusasai).

Translation - Virtuous men (satpurusha) remain detached from life (jivitam) and destroy karma (karma) like the veil of knowledge (jnaanavaran). Through their pure conduct (pavitra acharana), they are face-to-face with liberation (moksha) and are practitioners of liberation (moksha sadhaka). They discipline (anusasana) and teach (shiksha) the path to liberation (moksha marg).

Commentary - Another point - They disregard (anadrutya) life (jivitam) which is a life of non-restraint (asanyama) or disregard life (jivitam) which is the characteristic of maintaining the breath (pranadharana). They are dedicated to virtuous conduct (sadanushthana) and attain the end (anta) of karma (karma) like the veil of knowledge (jnaanavaran) etc. Or, they attain the end (anta) of karma (karma) -

The Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra. Those who live by the principles of the Sutra, free from worldly desires, attain the end of all dualities, known as liberation. Those who have not attained liberation, but through their specific practices, are close to liberation, and through the destruction of the four types of karmas, they attain divine knowledge and are on the path to eternal liberation. Who are these people? The Sutra says: Those whose Tirthankara name karma is ripening, who have attained divine knowledge, and who teach the path of liberation, which is based on right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct, for the benefit of all beings, and who themselves follow this path. ||10||

Commentary: Those who disregard the life of non-restraint and live a life of restraint, engaged in virtuous conduct, they end the karmas that obscure knowledge. Or, they are free from worldly desires, engaged in virtuous conduct. They end the ocean of samsara and reach the other shore, where all dualities and suffering cease. They attain liberation. Those who have not attained liberation, through their specific practices, are close to liberation. They destroy the four types of karmas, attain divine knowledge, and are on the path to liberation. Who are these people? The Sutra explains: Those whose Tirthankara name karma is ripening, who have attained divine knowledge, who teach the path of liberation, which is based on right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct, for the benefit of all beings, and who themselves follow this path. They are on the path to liberation.

The teachings are spread among all beings, like water and earth. Those who are free from desires, who have conquered their senses, who are firm in their vows, and who are free from sexual desires, are on the path to liberation. ||11||

Commentary: The Sutra explains the nature of the teachings: The teachings are spread among all beings, like water and earth. Those who are free from desires, who have conquered their senses, who are firm in their vows, and who are free from sexual desires, are on the path to liberation.

Translation:

Although he is engaged in the study of the Adaanamaanaka (a Jain text) and is present in the samavasharan (Jain assembly) and other such activities in terms of substance (dravya), he is devoid of relishing or enjoying them in terms of the state of being (bhava). This is because he is free from any attachment or desire towards them. Even though he engages in their enjoyment, he is ever vigilant and firmly established in true restraint (satsanyama). How is this so? Because he has conquered his senses and mind. This quality of his is firm in restraint. He has abandoned and renounced sexual intercourse (mithuna), and is free from the desire for sensual pleasures. Due to the absence of such desires, he is steadfast in restraint. He possesses extensive and flawless conduct (aayataacaaritratva), and is therefore controlled (daanta) in his senses and mind. Because of this control over the senses and his diligent efforts, he does not relish the worship and honor offered by the devas (celestial beings) and others. Due to this lack of relishing, even though he engages in the enjoyment of substances (dravya), he remains firmly established in true restraint.

The Sutra of the Sri Sutra Kritanga says: Just as a pig is not attracted to rice, so too, a sage who has cut off the flow of the karmic currents, and is free from the defilements of attachment and aversion, does not get entangled in worldly attractions. He, who is always free from the enjoyment of objects, and is a conqueror of the self, attains the unparalleled state of liberation.

Commentary: The Sutra asks why a sage abstains from sexual indulgence. It explains that just as a pig is lured to its death by rice, so too, a man is lured to suffering by sexual indulgence. Just as the pig is subjected to various tortures after being lured to its death by rice, so too, a man suffers various torments after being lured by sexual indulgence. Therefore, a sage, knowing the truth, does not engage in sexual indulgence.

The Sutra further explains that a sage who has cut off the flow of the karmic currents, and is free from the defilements of attachment and aversion, does not get entangled in worldly attractions. He, who is always free from the enjoyment of objects, and is a conqueror of the self, attains the unparalleled state of liberation.

He, who is always free from the enjoyment of objects, and is a conqueror of the self, attains the unparalleled state of liberation.

## The Study of Adana - Translation

**Verse 13:**

The study of Adana - The man who is engaged in the path of restraint as exemplified by the Tirthankaras, does not oppose or harbor animosity towards any living being in thought, word, or deed. He is truly the one with vision, the one with eyes, the one who sees the ultimate truth.

**Commentary:**

The term "Anidrisha" refers to something that is unparalleled, unique. This refers to the restraint or the Dharma as taught by the Mauniendras (Tirthankaras). The man who is skilled or proficient in this restraint, does not oppose or harbor animosity towards any living being. He cultivates friendship towards all beings. This is achieved through the three yogas of mind, speech, and body, and the three karmas of action, reaction, and approval. The commentator explains that this man is peaceful in mind, speaks truthfully and beneficially, and controls all harmful bodily actions. He walks with awareness, observing the ground carefully. Thus, he is truly the one with vision, the one with eyes, the one who sees the ultimate truth.

**Verse 14:**

Those who are free from desires, who are the end of all desires, are like eyes for all people. Just as the end of a razor or a wheel is the part that moves, similarly, the end of the binding karma is the destruction of the cycle of birth and death.

**Commentary:**

The word "Hu" in the verse signifies "possession". The one who has attained the destruction of karma, who has broken the bonds of karma, is the one who is proficient in the unparalleled restraint or the Dharma as taught by the Tirthankaras. This man is like an eye for the aspiring souls, revealing the true nature of things. He is the one who has ended all desires, all cravings for worldly pleasures. The commentator uses the example of a razor and a wheel to illustrate this point. Just as the end of a razor or a wheel is the part that moves, similarly, the end of the binding karma is the destruction of the cycle of birth and death.

Page #638:
---------------------------
The Sutra-Kritanga Sutra says, "Who takes hold of the end?"  The solution is, "He certainly obtains it."  We will explain this with an example:  Just as a barber's razor, the tool for cutting hair, moves from its end, from the edge that exists at its end, so too does the wheel of a chariot move on the path from its end.  The meaning is that just as the end of the razor, etc., is the part that performs the action, that accomplishes the task, in the same way, the end of worldly enjoyment and the karmas of attachment and delusion, which are attractive, is what destroys this miserable, sorrowful world.

The wise ones practice the end, therefore they are the destroyers of the end here.  Here in the human realm, people worship Dharma.  ||15||

Commentary:  The Sutra-kar, explaining the meaning of the previous verse, says, "The wise ones, the great souls, who are free from the desire for worldly pleasures, practice the end, the end of the objects of desire, the passions, and the thirst for them, and the end of the karmas related to them, the end of gardens, etc., and the end of food, etc."  By practicing the end, by practicing the end of the objects of desire, they become "destroyers of the end," destroyers of the world, or destroyers of the karmas that are the cause of the world.  "Here" means in the human realm, in the realm of the Aryas.  Not only the Tirthankaras, etc., but also other beings who have attained a place in this human realm, worship Dharma, which is characterized by right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct.  These "people," these humans, who are born in the womb of the karmic field, with a lifespan of countless years, obtain the materials for righteous conduct, and become "those who have attained their goal," free from all dualities.  ||15||

The gods have declared that the self is the only thing to be known,
Or, this self is the northern direction.  It is not so among non-humans.  ||16||

---------------------------
This study, known as _Adananamaka_, states that only humans, not gods, can attain liberation by eliminating karma. This is what I have heard from the Tirthankaras. I have heard this from some, but not from others.  

**Translation:** The _Uttariya-lokoत्तर_ teachings, or _Agamas_, state that only humans can attain liberation by eliminating karma and becoming a _Siddha_ or a god. I have heard this from the Tirthankaras. Non-human beings cannot attain liberation.

**Commentary:** This means that those who have fulfilled their purpose ( _niṣṭhitārthāḥ_ ) become liberated. Some, due to an abundance of karma, even with the attainment of right faith ( _samyaktva_ ) and other qualities, do not attain liberation in the same life but become gods in the _Saudharmā_ or other higher celestial realms. This is what is stated in the _lokoत्तर_ teachings, or _Agamas_.  

The _Sudharma Swami_ or _Jambū Swami_ said, "I have heard this from the supreme Tirthankaras in the _lokoत्तर_ realm. A person who has attained right faith and other qualities can become a _Siddha_ or a celestial being." This is only possible in the human realm, not elsewhere. To emphasize this, the text says, "I have heard this from the Tirthankaras."  

The _Gaṇadhara_ said to some of his disciples, "I have heard from the Tirthankaras that only humans can attain liberation by eliminating all karma." There are no other beings besides humans who can attain liberation. This refutes the Buddhist claim that only gods can attain liberation by eliminating all karma.  

Because non-human beings in the three realms ( _gati_ ) cannot attain right conduct ( _samyaktva_ ), they cannot attain liberation like humans.  

This is also stated in the text using the author's own name.

**Commentary:** Humans, as described above, become liberated by fulfilling their purpose ( _niṣṭhitārthāḥ_ ) and attaining liberation. However, many do not attain liberation in the same life due to an abundance of karma, even with the attainment of right faith ( _samyaktva_ ) and other qualities. Instead, they become gods in the _Saudharmā_ or other higher celestial realms. This is stated in the _lokoत्तर_ teachings, or _Agamas_.  

The _Sudharma Swami_ or _Jambū Swami_ said, "I have heard this from the supreme Tirthankaras in the _lokoत्तर_ realm. A person who has attained right faith and other qualities can become a _Siddha_ or a celestial being." This is only possible in the human realm, not elsewhere.

Because non-human beings in the three realms ( _gati_ ) cannot attain right conduct ( _samyaktva_ ), they cannot attain liberation like humans.  

This is also stated in the text using the author's own name.

**End of the suffering:**

The great ones ( _dakkhaṇam_ ) have stated that only humans can end suffering.  

**The rarity of the human birth:**

Some have also stated that the human birth ( _samucchaya_ ) is very rare. 

**Translation:** The _Gaṇadhara_ and other great ones have stated that only humans can end all suffering, not other beings. Some have also stated that the human birth is very rare.

---------------------------
##  The Sutra Kritanga Sutra with Commentary -  

**Commentary:** Those who are not human beings are not capable of ending all their suffering, because they do not have the necessary resources. Some other schools of thought have stated that deities ascend to higher and higher realms, thereby eliminating all their afflictions. However, this is not the case in the teachings of the Tirthankaras. 

Gana-dhara and other great beings have told their disciples that this human body is obtained with great difficulty, like the rare meeting of two pieces of wood drifting apart in a vast ocean, due to the karmic dissolution. For those who have not practiced Dharma, this body is as difficult to obtain as a jewel lost in the ocean. It is said:

"Indeed, this human body is extremely rare, like a lightning flash in the vast ocean of existence. It is like a fleeting glimpse of a firefly." (1)

**Commentary:**  A being who has lost this human body and is wandering in other realms of existence, finds it difficult to attain enlightenment. It is difficult to obtain the Archa-leshya, the state of right faith, for those who engage in Dharma. 

**Commentary:**  Furthermore, for a being who has lost this human body or the true Dharma, and who has not accumulated merit, it is extremely difficult to attain enlightenment, or the attainment of right faith, in this world. This is because it takes a long time for the subtle particles of matter to change. Similarly, it is difficult to obtain the Archa-leshya, the state of right faith, which is the inner transformation of the mind, for those who have not practiced Dharma. Or, even the Archa-human body, which is characterized by the seeds of good karma, the birth in a noble family, the possession of all senses, and so on, is difficult to obtain. Those who explain the Dharma, and who are capable of understanding the Dharma, find it difficult to attain the Archa-leshya.

Page #641:
---------------------------
The study called Adana can be attained again in the form of Samyaktva after the half-pudgala-paravarta-kala. For a man who has not practiced Dharma, it is very difficult to attain Samyakdarshan, or to be independent of the internal results of Archa-leshya, Antahparinat, or Aantaric parinam. Or, the human body is called Archa. He who has not sown the seed of Dharma, does not attain it. It is very difficult to get the Aryan field, birth in a noble family, all the material in the form of senses, healthy and capable senses, etc. Among beings, those who contemplate the meaning of Dharma, are worthy of Dharma-pratipatti. It is very rare to attain such leshya.
Those who declare the pure Dharma, complete and unparalleled.
Where is the place of the unparalleled, how is their birth story?
Commentary - Those great men who are free from attachment, who see the whole world like a myrobalan in the palm of their hand, who are devoted to the welfare of others, declare the pure Dharma, which is free from all limitations, and they themselves practice it. They declare the Dharma which is complete, full of good qualities, and unparalleled, and they follow it. Thus, where is the place of the unparalleled, the one who has attained knowledge and conduct, who is free from all dualities and troubles? How can there be a story of his birth? How can there be a story of his birth and death, even in a dream, because he has no karma seeds? It is said:
"Just as a seed that is completely burnt, does not sprout. So too, when the karma seed is burnt, the sprout of existence does not grow."

They declare the Dharma which is complete, full of good qualities, and unparalleled, and they follow it. They attain the place of the one who has knowledge and conduct, who is free from all dualities and troubles. How can they be born again in this world? It is not possible to say that they were born and died, even in a dream, because they have no karma seeds. Therefore, how can there be birth and death? It is said:
"Just as a seed that is completely burnt, does not sprout. So too, when the karma seed is burnt, the sprout of existence does not grow."
How does the wise one arise, he arises there, gone.
Gone there, unstained, the eyes of the highest beings.

Commentary - Kincan yat - Due to the absence of karma seeds, 'kutaḥ' from where, even once, 'medhāvino' those who are knowledgeable, Tathagatas who have gone beyond rebirth, are born again in this impure world of conception? Not at all, they are not born due to the absence of karma as an instrument, that is the meaning. Also, 'Tathagatas' Tirthankaras, Ganadharas, etc., do not have a promise - a bond of diagnosis, those who are free from promises, without diagnosis, without hope, dedicated to the welfare of beings, are supreme due to their supreme knowledge, 'lokasya' of the group of beings, because they are the eyes of the world, they are the cause of the identification of the true and false meaning, they are the Tathagatas who are omniscient, they do good and avoid harm, they are the eyes of the whole world. ||20|| Kincan yat
Commentary meaning - Medhavi - a wise man who, due to the absence of karma seeds, has destroyed all karmas and attained liberation. Where, after going, there is no return to the cycle of rebirth, how can they be born again in this impure world of conception? Due to the absence of karma as an instrument, they are never born again in the world in any way. Free from the bond of promise and diagnosis, free from hope or desire, dedicated to the welfare of beings, unparalleled due to their supreme knowledge, unparalleled, they are the eyes of beings, because they are the cause of the identification of the true and false meaning, omniscient Tirthankaras and Ganadharas, etc., are the eyes of the world. They are omniscient Tirthankaras and great men who bring about the attainment of good for all and the avoidance of harm. They are like eyes for everyone.

Commentary meaning - That which has no other or superior place is called Anuttar. That is restraint. Shri Vardhaman Swami, born in the Kashyap lineage, Bhagavan Shri Mahavira, has declared this restraint.

I have studied the Adan text. To explain its excellence and the ultimate goal, the sutrakar says: Those who are virtuous, have excellent conduct, are great souls, and follow the path of restraint, attain liberation. They are free from the cycle of birth and death, wise, free from sin, and knowledgeable. They end the cycle of birth and death. This is the path of restraint that Lord Mahavira established. By following this path, people attain liberation.

##  Śrī Sūtrakr̥tāṅga Sūtra

**Commentary:**  -  "Mahāvīra:"  being tolerant of the destruction of karma, does not do what other beings do due to their sequential engagement in falsehood, non-restraint, carelessness, passions, and their combinations.  This is because he is only affected by the dust (karma) accumulated in his previous lives.  He, having taken hold of his previous karma, faces it with perfect restraint.  Having faced it, he abandons all eight types of karma, becoming face-to-face with liberation or perfect restraint. ||23||

**Commentary Meaning:**  A man capable of destroying karma does not perform those sinful actions that other beings perform sequentially through falsehood, non-restraint, carelessness, passions, and their combinations.  Because those sinful actions are performed only due to the dust (karma) accumulated in previous lives.  The aforementioned strong-souled man, accepting and assimilating perfect restraint, destroys the karma he has performed in the past, becoming liberated.  In other words, he abandons and avoids the eight types of karma, becoming face-to-face with liberation or perfect restraint, and is dedicated to practicing restraint.

**Mayam Sallagattan:**
What is accepted by all the virtuous, that is the cutting of the arrow (karma),
Having achieved it, they have crossed over, they have become gods. ||24||

**Shadow:**  What is the opinion of all the virtuous, that opinion is the cutting of the arrow (karma).
Having achieved it, they have crossed over, they have become gods.

**Om Om Om**

**Translation:**  The restraint accepted by all virtuous people cuts away the arrow (karma) of sin.  Beings, having achieved it, have crossed over the ocean of the world, attained liberation, or become gods, and have gone to the heavenly realm.

-

**Commentary:**  -  And again, "Jammay" etc., what is the "opinion" of all the virtuous, that is this place of perfect restraint.  It cuts away the arrow (karma) - the performance of sin or the karma arising from it.  That cutting of the arrow (karma) is the perfect practice.  Many, having achieved it, having properly worshipped, have crossed over the wilderness of the world.  Others, due to the lack of destruction of all karma, have become gods.  They, having attained perfect knowledge and being of good conduct, have attained, attain, and will attain the status of celestial beings. ||24||

**Commentary Meaning:**  The place of restraint is accepted, considered, and approved by all virtuous people.  Describing its characteristics, the author of the sutra states that this place of restraint cuts away the arrow (karma) - the performance of sinful actions or the karma arising from them.  According to the scriptures, many men, walking on the path of righteousness, have achieved it, properly worshipped it, and crossed over the terrifying and dreadful forest of the world.  And others, who have not been able to destroy all karma, have become gods, and have gone to the realm of the gods.  Men of perfect knowledge and good conduct have become, are, and will be celestial beings.  Om Om Om

This study, known as Adana, is a shadow of the past - for there were many valiant and strong souls in the past, and there will be many virtuous ones in the future. They, the great souls, have illuminated the path of the difficult-to-understand, the path of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, and have crossed the ocean of existence. 
Commentary: The author concludes by saying, "In the past, many great souls, capable of destroying karma, existed. Similarly, in the present, such souls exist on the field of karma, and in the infinite future, such souls, who practice restraint, will exist. What have they done, what do they do, and what will they do?" The author explains, "They, the great souls, have reached the ultimate goal of the difficult-to-understand path of right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct, and have illuminated that path for others. They are themselves on that path, and they have crossed, are crossing, and will cross the ocean of existence." The past has been followed, now the present is the focus, and it should be viewed in the same way as the past. The word "iti" marks the end of the study. "Bravimi" means "I speak," and it is used here as it was before. 
This is the end of the fifteenth study, known as Adaniya.

The sixteenth chapter of the Sutra Kritanga Sutra, the Sri Gathadhyayana.

The Blessed One said: "Thus, that person who is restrained, who has abandoned the body, is to be called a Mahan, a Shraman, a Bhikshu, or a Nigrantha."

The disciple asked: "Venerable one, how is that person who is restrained, who has abandoned the body, to be called a Mahan, a Shraman, a Bhikshu, or a Nigrantha? Please tell us, Great Muni!"

The Blessed One said: "He who is free from all evil deeds, who has abandoned attachment, aversion, strife, slander, envy, backbiting, aversion, attraction, illusion, falsehood, and wrong views, who is united, who is committed, who is always devoted, who does not get angry, who does not become proud, is to be called a Mahan."

Translation:

The one endowed with the qualities mentioned earlier, such as Shri Gatha-adhyayana, brahmacharya-dharana, etc., is to be called a virtuous Brahmana [Granthagra 8000] or a Shramana who is fatigued by austerities. Or, the one whose mind is equanimous towards friends and others is called a Sammanah, like a sandalwood tree. As it is said, "There is no one who is his enemy." Thus, the Shramana endowed with the aforementioned qualities or the one with an equanimous mind is to be called a Sadhu. Similarly, the one with the habit of begging is a Bhikshu, as he destroys the eight types of karma. He is to be called a virtuous Bhikshu endowed with qualities like self-control. He is Nirgranth, without external or internal scriptures. He is the one who follows the teachings of the Fifteen Anga and is danta (self-controlled), dravyabhuta (embodied), and vyutsrishtakaya (relinquished body), and is thus to be called a Nirgranth. When this is stated by the Bhagavan, the disciple asks - "O Bhagavan! O Bhadanta! O Bhayanta! O Bhavanta! How can the one who is danta, dravyabhuta, vyutsrishtakaya, be called a Brahmana, Shramana, Bhikshu, and Nirgranth?" In response, the Bhagavan explains the different connotations of these terms and their respective grounds for application. The Shramana, being established in the meaning of the earlier teachings, is 'virata' (abstained) from all sinful actions and observances. He is free from attachment, aversion, delusion, dispute, false accusation, slander, and intolerance of others' virtues. He does not get angry even when provoked and does not have pride even if endowed with superior austerities. As it is said, "If he too is free from the intoxication of pride, he should renounce the remaining causes of pride through effort." Due to the figurative meaning, even attachment arising from delusion and greed should not be indulged in. Thus, the greatness of the virtuous Sadhu is to be stated without any doubt.

---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** is. The word "dravya" is also used in the sense of "bhavy". Accordingly, because it is free from the "apdravya-vikara" (imperfections) that occur in the state of being possessed by "rag" (attachment), "dvesha" (aversion), and "kalik-rag" (temporal attachment) and "dvesha" (aversion), it is like pure gold, a pure "dravya" (substance), and perfectly holy, following the path of "samyama" (self-restraint). Because it is free from "prati karma" (karmic reactions), "daihik" (physical) "saj" (ornaments) and "saja" (decorations), it is free from the attachment to the "vyutsrisht-kaya" (liberated body) and "daihik" (physical). Thus, in the meanings described in previous studies, in the actions of "dharmacharan" (righteous conduct), in the activities, the "sadhu" (saint) does not kill or harm any living beings, whether they are stationary, mobile, subtle, gross, sufficient, or insufficient. It is called "mahan" (great). Or, the one who is protected by the nine "gupta" (secret) "vritti" (activities) and "bad" (fences) of "brahmacharya" (celibacy), and who is a follower of unbroken "brahmacharya" (celibacy), and who possesses the qualities described earlier, is called "mahan" or "brahman" (a person who has realized the Brahman). The one who is "shranta" (tired), who is "khinn" (distressed) by "tap" (austerity), is called "shraman" (ascetic). Or, the one whose mind is the same everywhere, in enemies, friends, etc., is "samamana" (equanimous). He is like a sandalwood tree, which has no aversion or enmity towards the axe or the woodcutter who cuts it. Similarly, he has no aversion towards his "apkari" (wrongdoer). Therefore, it is said that there is no one who is "dveshya" (worthy of aversion) for him. Thus, the "sadhu" (saint) who is adorned with the qualities mentioned earlier is called "shraman" (ascetic) or "samamana" (equanimous). "Bhikshu" (mendicant) refers to a "sadhu" (saint) who is "bhikshanashila" (one who lives on alms) and "bhikshopajibi" (one who lives on alms). Or, the one who destroys the eight types of "karma" (actions) by separating them, is a "bhikshu" (mendicant). That is, the "sadhu" (saint) who is endowed with qualities like "damanshilata" (self-control), "jitendriyata" (control over senses), etc., is called a "bhikshu" (mendicant). Because he is free from external and internal "granthi" (knots), he is called "nirgranth" (free from knots). That is, the "sadhu" (saint) who follows the meanings expounded in the previous fifteen chapters, who is "dant" (free from attachment), "dravya-bhoot" (pure substance), and "vyutsrisht-kaya" (liberated body), is worthy of being called "nirgranth" (free from knots).

When the Lord said this, the disciple asked, "O Lord! O "Bhadant" (venerable sir)! O "bhayant" (fear-destroyer), O "bhav-ant-bhav-nashak" (destroyer of the cycle of birth and death), who is "dant" (free from attachment), "dravya-bhoot" (pure substance), and "vyutsrisht-kaya" (liberated body), why is he called "brahman" (a person who has realized the Brahman), "shraman" (ascetic), "bhikshu" (mendicant), and "nirgranth" (free from knots)? As you have expounded, the words "brahman" etc. are used to refer to the "sadhu" (saint). O "Mahamune" (great sage)! O "yatharth-vetta" (knower of the truth of the three times)! Please explain this to us!" When asked thus, the Lord explained the reasons for the use of the four appellations "brahman" etc., which are different from each other in some respects, and how they are used in practice. In the meanings described in the previous study, the one who is "vritti-yukt" (engaged in activities) and "vartan-shila" (conducts himself) is free from all "papakarma" (sinful actions) and "savadya" (defective) "anushtan" (practices). He is free from "prem-rag-moolak-aaskti" (attachment based on love and attachment), "dvesha-apriti" (aversion and dislike), "kalah-dvandva-adhikaran" (quarrels and disputes), "sangarsh" (struggle), "jhagada" (fight), "abhyakhyan-asat-abhiyog" (false accusations), "paishunya-chugali" (backbiting and gossip), "par-guna-asahishnuta" (intolerance towards the qualities of others), "dosh-ka-udghatan" (revealing the faults of others), "par-parivad" (slander), "kaku-vikrut-kanth-dhvani" (speaking in a distorted voice to accuse others), "arati-samyam-me-chitt-ki-udvignta" (anxiety in self-restraint), "rati-sansarik-vishayon-me-aaskti" (attachment to worldly objects), "maya-parvanchana" (deceiving others), "dhokha-dena" (cheating), "maya-dwara-kutil-buddhi-purvak-asaty-bhashan" (speaking falsely with a cunning mind), "asat-arth-ka-abhidhan-kathn" (speaking falsely, like calling a cow a horse), "mithya-darshan-atatva-me-tatva-abhinivesh" (insisting on the truth of what is not true, or believing in the untruth of what is true). For example, there is no soul, it is not eternal, it does not do anything, it does not experience the fruits of its actions, there is no liberation, and there is no way to liberation. These are the six "mithyatva" (falsehood) "sthan" (

Do not be angry or become controlled by anger even when engaged in the study of the sacred scriptures. Even when engaged in excellent and supreme austerities, do not be proud or arrogant. It has been said that the great men who churned the eight types of pride also prohibited the pride of asceticism and austerity. One should diligently avoid the remaining places of pride. One should also not be attached to the delusion of greed. A sage adorned with such qualities is undoubtedly called a "Mahan" (great). Now, to reveal the reason for using the term "Shraman" (ascetic), it is said:

Here, an ascetic is one who is free from attachment, free from the desire for worldly pleasures, free from taking, free from violence, free from falsehood, free from sexual misconduct, free from anger, free from pride, free from delusion, free from greed, free from love, and free from hatred. Whoever is free from taking, whoever is the cause of hatred for the self, whoever is free from taking, whoever is free from violence, whoever is subdued, whoever is free from the body, is called an ascetic.

Commentary: Here, the ascetic who is present in the group of qualities like renunciation, etc., mentioned earlier, is also called an ascetic. It is said that even those who are endowed with these qualities are called ascetics. There is no excess in this statement. "Shrita" means attached, "Anishrita" means not attached. One who is not attached to the body, etc., is called "Anishrita". Similarly, "Nidan" means the cause, "Anidan" means without a cause. One who is free from the desire for worldly pleasures, who is free from the desire for the destruction of all karmas, and who is engaged in the practice of self-control is called "Anidan". "Adan" means to take, to accept, to perform the eight types of karmas. It is the attachment to the passions, the attachment to possessions, or the performance of actions with attachment. "Atipat" means violence, which means killing. One should know this violence through knowledge and understanding, and should avoid it through the knowledge of rejection. Similarly, the action should be applied in other cases as well. "Mrushavad" means false speech. One should know this false speech and avoid it. "Bahiddha" means sexual misconduct and attachment to possessions. One should know these two things properly and avoid them. These are the basic qualities. Now, describing the other qualities, it is said that anger is characterized by displeasure, pride is characterized by arrogance, delusion is characterized by deception, greed is characterized by selfishness, love is characterized by attachment, and hatred is characterized by the destruction of oneself and others. One should know these things properly and avoid them, as they are the path to the cycle of birth and death and the destruction of the path to liberation. Similarly, one should avoid any other action that leads to the accumulation of karma, which causes harm in this world and the next, and which is the cause of hatred for the self. One should avoid these actions, even before they occur, because they are the cause of harm. One should avoid all actions that are the cause of harm in both worlds, and should strive to be free from the performance of actions with attachment. One who is thus subdued, pure, free from the body, free from karmas, and free from the body is called an ascetic.

## The Sutra Kritanga Sutra Commentary - English Translation

The term "Sadhu Shraman" refers to a virtuous individual possessing the qualities of "Virati" (non-attachment) and others as described earlier. It is expected that such a Shraman is associated with a group of Shramans.

The commentators explain that a person who is firmly attached to a particular object or substance is called "Nishrit" (attached). One who is free from attachment to the body and other things is called "Anishrit" (unattached). A person who does not desire the cause and effect of actions is called "Nidan" (unattached to results). Such a person, free from desires, strives to practice restraint with the goal of destroying all karmas.

Those who acquire or bind eight types of karmas are called "Nidan" (attached to results). "Kashaya" (passions), "Parigraha" (attachment), and "Savadhan Anushthan" (careless practices) fall under the category of "Nidan".

"Atipatana" or "Atipat" (violence) is called "Pranatipat" (violence against life). It should be recognized through "Jnana Parijna" (knowledge) and abandoned through "Pratyakhyan Parijna" (rejection). Similarly, other actions should be dealt with accordingly.

Speaking falsehood is called "Mrishvad" (false speech). "Abrahmacharya" (sexual misconduct) and "Parigraha" (attachment) are called "Bahiddha" (external). These should be recognized and abandoned.

The "Mula Guna" (root qualities) have been discussed. Now, the "Uttara Guna" (secondary qualities) are explained. "Aapriti" (displeasure) is called "Krodha" (anger), "Stambh-Ghamanda" (pride) is called "Man" (ego), "Pravanchana" (deception) is called "Maya" (illusion), "Murcha" (fainting) is called "Lobha" (greed), "Anurag" (attachment) is called "Prem" (love), and the obstacles created for oneself and others are called "Desha" (defects). These are the paths leading to rebirth in the world. They are destructive to the path of liberation. Therefore, they should be recognized and abandoned.

Similarly, other factors that contribute to the binding of karmas, causing harm in this world and the next, are detrimental to the soul, causing obstacles and suffering. These are the causes of "Pradesh" (defects). The soul should recognize and avoid these actions, which are harmful, pointless, and filled with sin.

The soul, desiring its own welfare, should avoid these actions from the beginning. A person seeking liberation should stay away from these harmful actions, which are against the principles of this world and the next. Such a person, who is self-controlled, pure, follows the path of restraint, and is free from external adornments and attachment to the body, is called a "Shraman".

Here, the monk, who is humble, virtuous, self-controlled, free from attachment to material possessions, practices restraint, endures various hardships and obstacles, is pure and cleansed through spiritual practice, is stable in his mind, and lives on alms given by others, is called a "Bhikshu".

The commentary explains that the term "Bhikshu" is used here because the qualities mentioned earlier, like "Virati" (non-attachment) and others, are also applicable to the term "Bhikshu". These qualities, along with others like "Anunnat" (humble), "Vinit" (virtuous), "Jitendiya" (self-controlled), "Sanayam Pathangata" (following the path of restraint), and "Dehasakti Viheen" (free from attachment to the body), are the characteristics of a "Bhikshu". He endures various hardships and obstacles, is purified through spiritual practice, is stable in his mind, and lives on alms given by others. He is called a "Bhikshu".

Page #651:
---------------------------
The one who is not elevated or arrogant is called *anunnata*. There are two types of elevation: elevation of substance (*dravyaunnata*) and elevation of feeling (*bhavoonnata*). The one who is elevated by the body is *dravyaunnata*, and the one who is elevated by feeling or is attached to the feeling of arrogance is *bhavoonnata*. This is being negated here. This implies that he does not have arrogance towards austerity (*tapa*) and liberation (*nirjara*). He is humble and has a good disposition. He is the one who is a *bhiksu*. The sutra-kara states that the one who is adorned with humility, who is humble when being instructed by the guru or at other times, i.e., who is always humble towards the guru and other venerable persons, or who humbles the eight types of karma through humility, and who, being devoted to service, destroys all sins, is a *bhiksu*. He conquers the senses and the mind. He dwells with a pure feeling in his soul. He transcends the body by abandoning external adornments. He endures various types of favorable and unfavorable, pleasant and unpleasant, high and low, twenty-two *parisahas* and divine and other afflictions. He destroys them. He is not defeated by them, i.e., he destroys the *parisahas* and afflictions through *adhyatma yoga*, by having a well-controlled mind, by practicing *dharma dhyana*, and by maintaining pure conduct. He is *shuddhadana*. He is elevated by good conduct (*samyak utthana*) and is established in the path of liberation (*moksha dhwani*). He is not arrogant towards *parisahas* and afflictions and remains stable in his soul. He knows the impermanence of the world, the difficulty of attaining enlightenment in the realm of karma, and the rarity of knowledge. He obtains all the resources for crossing the world and is devoted to the practice of perfect restraint (*samyama*). He eats food given by others, i.e., he eats food prepared by householders for their own use. The one who is adorned with these qualities is called a *bhiksu*. The one who dwells in these qualities is called *nirgrantha*. There are some other qualities that are required for him. They are as follows:

Page #652:
---------------------------
The Sutra of the Sri Sutra Kritanga says: In this way, a Niggrantha, who is a single-minded Buddha, with his stream of karma cut off, well-controlled, well-balanced, and well-established in equanimity, having attained the knowledge of the Self, is a scholar who has cut off both types of streams of karma, and is not seeking worship, respect, or gain. He is a devotee of Dharma, a knower of Dharma, and has attained the path of liberation. He walks with equanimity, is subdued, is a follower of the path of virtue, and has abandoned attachment to the body. He is called a Niggrantha. Know this to be true, for I am the savior from fear. Thus ends the sixteenth chapter of the Gatha. Thus ends the first chapter of the Suyagandha.

Page #653:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Chapter 16: The Gatha**

Then, some may say, "The study of the Gatha is as follows: The soul is one, pervading the entire universe, the nature of all things, the size of a black sesame seed, or the size of a thumb joint, etc." Such a false assumption is to be rejected, as there is no evidence to support the existence of such a soul.

The meaning is this: "There are two aspects, namely, substance and mode. In substance, there are streams of substance, such as the senses, which are directed towards their respective objects. In mode, there are streams of mode, such as sound, etc., which are favorable or unfavorable, arising from attachment and aversion. These streams of mode are also limited, due to the covering of the senses and the absence of attachment and aversion. Thus, he is one with limited streams. He does not perform actions for the sake of worship, respect, or gain, but for the sake of liberation. This is what is shown by the term 'Dharma' - the meaning of which is 'Shrutacharitra' (the practice of the scriptures). This is the same meaning as 'Dharma-artha' (the purpose of Dharma). He who is a Dharma-arthi (one who seeks Dharma) exists. This is what is said: 'He does not engage in actions for the sake of worship, etc., but for the sake of Dharma.' Why? Because he knows Dharma and its fruits, such as the attainment of heaven, correctly. He who knows Dharma correctly, does what he does. This is shown by the term 'Niyaga' - the path of liberation, or perfect restraint. He who has fully embraced this Niyaga, in both substance and mode, is like a Niyaga-padi (one who has attained liberation). What should such a person do? He should 'Sam (b) yam' - practice equality, or equanimity, like sandalwood. What kind of person is he? He is 'Dant' - free from attachment, and 'Vyutsrishta-kaya' - one who has renounced the body. He is endowed with these qualities, and is a 'Shraman-bhikshu' (a mendicant monk) as described earlier. He is also free from attachments, as the term 'Shraman-bhikshu' implies. These terms, such as 'Mahana', etc., are not separate from the term 'Nirgrantha' (one who is free from attachments). All these terms, even though they have different meanings, are ultimately one in meaning."

**Conclusion**

Now, to conclude, the author says, addressing Sudharma Swami, Jambuswami, etc., "You should know what I have said as it is. There is no other interpretation to be made of my words, because I speak with the knowledge of the omniscient. The omniscient ones do not speak otherwise out of fear of harming others, because they are free from attachment, aversion, and delusion, which are the root causes of harm. Therefore, you should understand what I have said from the beginning as it is."

Thus, the conclusion is reached. The author says, "I speak" as before.

Now, the Nayas (principles of interpretation) are explained. There are seven Nayas, namely:

1. **Naigama:** This is the general principle, which encompasses both the general and the particular.
2. **Sangraha:** This is the principle of collection, which is a part of Naigama.
3. **Vyavahara:** This is the principle of practical application, which is also a part of Naigama.
4. **Rju-sutra:** This is the principle of the straight thread, which is a part of Naigama and Vyavahara.
5. **Shabda:** This is the principle of words, which is a part of Naigama, Sangraha, and Vyavahara.
6. **Dravya-astika:** This is the principle of the existence of substance, which is a part of Naigama, Sangraha, Vyavahara, Rju-sutra, and Shabda.
7. **Paryaya-astika:** This is the principle of the existence of synonyms, which is a part of Naigama, Sangraha, Vyavahara, Rju-sutra, Shabda, and Dravya-astika.

There are two Nayas within Dravya-astika and Paryaya-astika, namely:

1. **Jnana-naya:** This is the principle of knowledge, which is the primary principle.
2. **Kriya-naya:** This is the principle of action, which is also a part of Jnana-naya.

There are also two Nayas within Jnana-naya and Kriya-naya, namely:

1. **Jnana-naya:** This is the principle of knowledge, which is the primary principle.
2. **Kriya-naya:** This is the principle of action, which is also a part of Jnana-naya.

Each of the Nayas is based on a relative truth, and both knowledge and action are essential for liberation. Both are important, and both are achieved through right action.

**Gatha**

"In what is to be taken and what is not to be taken, in what is to be striven for, that instruction is called Naya."

**Gatha**

"Having heard the various ways of all the Nayas, he who is established in the qualities of conduct, is pure in all the Nayas, is the virtuous one."

Thus ends the Gatha, the sixteenth chapter. With its completion, the first Skandha of the Shruta is also completed.

**Commentary**

The person who is free from attachment and aversion is alone, or solitary. Or, the being who wanders in this cycle of existence, experiences the fruits of his actions in the form of pleasure and pain, and goes alone to the next world, is always alone. The virtuous one, who is excellent in the practice of restraint, is alone in both substance and mode. While he is a part of the Gachcha-sangha (community of monks) due to circumstances, he is a part of the sangha in terms of substance, but alone in terms of mode. Similarly, he who knows that the soul goes alone to the next world is an 'Ekavit' (one who knows the oneness of the soul). Or, he who knows that there is no one to protect or save him from suffering is an 'Ekavit'.

Page #654:
---------------------------
The **Shri Sutra Kritanga Sutra** states that a **Ekantvit** is one who knows with certainty the nature of the world and the path to liberation, as taught by the **Tirthankaras**. They believe that this path is the only truth, and there is no other. A **Ekantvit** is also one who knows only liberation or restraint. They are **bound** (having understood and acquired the principles), **Sanchhinna Srot** (having closed the doors of inflow of karma), **Susanyat** (restrained like a tortoise, free from useless bodily actions), **Susamit** (united with the five samitis, having attained the path of liberation), **Susamayak** (well-established in equanimity, seeing the same in friend and foe), and **Atmavad Prapt** (having attained the knowledge of the self). They know the true nature of the soul, which is characterized by its use, is infinite in its extent, capable of contraction and expansion, experiences the fruits of its actions, exists in every body, and is eternal, impermanent, and possesses infinite qualities. A **Vidvan** is one who knows the true nature of all things, not the opposite. For example, some say that the soul is one and pervades the universe because it is the nature of all things. Others believe it is the size of a grain of rice. Still others consider it to be the size of a finger joint. Such beliefs are rejected because they are not supported by evidence. A **Parichhinna Srot** is one who has closed the doors of inflow of karma, which are of two types: **Dravyasrot** and **Bhavasrot**. The former refers to the activities of the senses in their respective objects, while the latter refers to the arising of attachment and aversion when one encounters something favorable or unfavorable in the world of sound, etc. By restraining the senses and preventing attachment and aversion, one closes both types of doors. A **Poojasatkara Labharthi** is one who performs all austerities and other actions only for the sake of liberation, without desiring praise, honor, or benefit. This is why they are called **Dharmarthi**, because their goal is the **Shruta Charitra**-based dharma. They are not motivated by praise or honor, but by dharma, because they understand dharma and its fruits, such as attaining heaven. They are said to have **Niyag** (the path of liberation) or **Uttama Sanayam** (the highest restraint) in their entirety. Such a person is like **Vasi Chandan** (sandalwood), always following equanimity. They are **Dant-Damansheel** (having conquered the senses), **Mokshanugat** (following the path of liberation), and free from attachment to the body. They possess the qualities of **Mahan**, **Shraman**, and **Bhikshu**, which are all synonymous with **Nirgranth**. All these words, though different in form, have the same meaning. In conclusion, the **Sutrakar** says that **Shri Sudharmaswami** told **Jambu Swami** and others to understand and accept what he has said. He emphasizes that there should be no doubt or alternative interpretation, as he has spoken according to the teachings of the **Sarvagya Bhagwan**, who is always engaged in the welfare of others. They liberate beings from the fear of the world.

This is the study of the Shri Gatha. It reveals the right path and saves people from going to hell. They are free from attachment, aversion, and delusion. Therefore, they do not speak or teach anything contrary to reality. Therefore, you should understand everything I have said from the beginning until now in the same way. Here, the word "iti" means "end". "Bravimi" means "I speak" - it is as before. The exposition of "Anugam" is complete. Now we will discuss the "Nayas". There are seven "Nayas" including "Naigam". The "Naigam" "Naya" is general and specific. Therefore, it is included in "Sangrah" and "Vyavahar". Therefore, there are six "Nayas". The "Samasabhirudha" and "Itthambhut" "Nayas" are included in the word "Naya", leaving "Naigam", "Sangrah", "Vyavahar", "Riju Sutra", and "Shabda" as the five "Nayas". "Naigam" is also included in "Vyavahar". Therefore, there are four "Nayas". "Vyavahar" is also general and specific, so from the general point of view, it is included in "Sangrah", and from the specific point of view, it is included in "Riju Sutra". Thus, "Sangrah", "Riju Sutra", and "Shabda" remain as the three "Nayas". Including them in "Dravyastik" and "Paryayastik" results in two "Nayas", or including all "Nayas" in knowledge and action results in two "Nayas" called "Jnana" and "Kriya". The "Jnana" "Naya" considers knowledge as primary, and the "Kriya" "Naya" considers action as primary. Holding onto only one "Naya" separately is a false view. Both knowledge and action are mutually dependent - correct knowledge followed by correct action or good conduct is the part of liberation, and that is the main thing. Both of these are found in a virtuous person who is endowed with good actions and good conduct - restraint. It has been said that after knowing the objects that are to be taken and those that are not to be taken, one should strive for the practice that is beneficial to oneself. This is the teaching, and it is the "Naya". By listening to the various ways of expressing all the "Nayas" - the many ways of using words - the one who is established in the virtue of pure conduct of all "Nayas" is the virtuous person.

Translator and commentator, eloquent speaker, revered Priyadarshan Muni
On the 12th day of the bright fortnight of the month of Paush, Vikram Samvat 2030, in the village of Rata, Shri Manakchandji, son of Shri Jivrajji Sa. Kummat, was born, making the womb of the devout mother, Shrimati Badambaiji, successful.
Shri Manakchandji, endowed with sharp intellect, was engrossed in receiving good education and good manners from his childhood. Even then, while living in the world, he remained detached in his mind, a devotee of humility, wisdom, and gentleness. He flourished and blossomed under the guidance of the revered Acharya Pravara Shri Sohनलालजी M. Sa., receiving the religious teachings given by his parents. In Vikram Samvat 2044, on the 10th day of the bright fortnight of the month of Magh, he took the Arhati Diksha in Bijayanagar and became Muni Priyadarshan, becoming a carrier of the path to liberation.
He studied Hindi, Sanskrit, Prakrit, and other languages, and became engaged in acquiring profound knowledge of Nyaya, Darshan, Agam, and literature. He earned the title of "Ojaswi Vakta" while continuously moving like water on the great path of Samyak Sanjamaradhana.
The personality of the auspicious-sighted, auspicious-spoken, auspicious-doer, revered Priyadarshan Muni Maharaj, was a symbol of harmony, tolerance, and sincerity. He made the saying "Yatha Anto Tatha Bahi" meaningful through his life and conduct.
He has given new dimensions to his creativity as the successful author of the novel "Punyak Ke Path Par," while he has presented the life-memories of the revered Acharya Pravara Shri Sohनलालजी M. Sa. in the form of "Atit Ki Smritiyaan," expressing his devotion at the feet of his revered deity.

The world is full of joy and sorrow, both are present. All are inherently suffering, therefore all should be non-violent. (Sutra 1/4/84) The world (in its stages of childhood, youth, old age, etc.) is full of gross, material senses, and all are inherently unpleasant.  (Sutra 1/4/84)  Those who are attached to worldly pleasures (like desires for sensual gratification) and to their loved ones (like parents, spouses, etc.) are like birds trapped in a cage. When the time comes for them to experience the fruits of their karma, they suffer and die, just like a ripe date falls from the palm tree when its bond is broken. (Sutra 1/4/84)  The wise seeker transcends all attachments, patiently endures all physical and mental suffering caused by trials and tribulations. (Sutra 7/408)  He can only follow the path of pure conduct when he is complete (in knowledge, vision, and character), unattached (to worldly pleasures), free from fixed routines, fearless (both for himself and others), and whose soul is free from the defilement of passions. (Sutra 7/408)
