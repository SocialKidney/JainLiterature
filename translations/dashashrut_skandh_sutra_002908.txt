The lineage of Pujyapada Acharya Shri Amarsinghji Maharaj.
*
HI
The venerable Amarsingh, adorned with all virtues, was the disciple of the great ascetic, Ramabaskh, the Mahamuni.
His disciple, the learned and virtuous Motiramo, became the next in line.
The venerable Sohaṇlāl, who was a great scholar and a destroyer of false beliefs, became the next in line.
The venerable Kāsirāmo, who was a great teacher and a liberator of the ten types of beings, and who held the title of Panchālakeśarī, became the next in line. He was the head of the Sahiṭṭhamandal during his time.
May this lineage continue to flourish and may all our endeavors be successful.

**Swadhyaya**

The soul can develop through *swadhyaya*, but it must be done according to the proper method. If *swadhyaya* is done without method, it will not be able to develop the soul, because *swadhyaya* done according to the method is the true *swadhyaya*.

**The Fruit of Swadhyaya**

The question now arises: what is the fruit of doing *swadhyaya*? The answer is:

"Sazzhaenaṁ bhanta! Jīve ki janayai" "Sazzhaenaṁ nāṇāvaraṇijjaṁ kamma khavai"
Uttaraadhyayana A. 26 S. 18

That is, O Lord! What is the fruit of doing *swadhyaya*? The Lord says: O disciple! By doing *swadhyaya*, the *jnanaavaraniya* karma are destroyed. When the *jnanaavaraniya* karma are destroyed, the soul will develop itself, causing the soul to enter its own form, thus freeing it from all suffering. Because:

"Sazzhaae vā savvadukkhavimokkhaṇe"
Uttaraadhyayana A. 26 G. 10

That is, *swadhyaya* is the liberator from all suffering.

The origin of physical and mental suffering is ignorance. When ignorance is destroyed, those sufferings are also destroyed themselves. Because...

Page #18:
---------------------------
2
"Dukkhaṁ hayaṁ jassa na hoi moha"
Utt. A. 32 Ga. 7
Meaning: One who has no attachment, has as if destroyed all sorrows. Therefore, to be free from all kinds of sorrows, one should definitely do Swadhyay.

n
Which scriptures should one do Swadhyay of?
I
Swadhyay should be done of those scriptures which are Sarvjna-pranit, which are the indicators of true things, which are full of worldly and otherworldly teachings, which are the benefactors of both worlds, and whose Swadhyay leads to the attainment of elements like penance, forgiveness, and non-violence. The implication is that those scriptures whose Swadhyay can make the soul knowledgeable, virtuous, and ideal, are the ones worthy of Agam Swadhyay. Only through their Swadhyay can the soul recognize its true nature. But every believer considers their own Agams to be Sarvjna-pranit; then how can one decide which Agam is Sarvjna-pranit and which is not? The answer is that to examine the Agams, one needs to know the evidence and Nay with an impartial attitude. Those Agams which cannot be contradicted by evidence and Nay can be considered in the category of evidence. For example, some people have considered their own Agams to be Apourushey (spoken by God). Their statement is contradicted by evidence. Because when God is Akaay and Ashareeri, then how can he pronounce the verses in the form of letters! Because without a body, there is no mouth, and without a mouth, there cannot be pronunciation of letters. Therefore, their statement is proved to be contradicted by evidence. But Jain Agams prove this subject in such a way that no one can object to it and no doubt can arise. For example, words are Pourushey and meaning is Apourushey; that is, the Sarvjna souls have described those meanings through words which are Apourushey. Imagine that the Sarvjna soul described that 'the soul is eternal'. So this word is Pourushey, but the substance described by the words is eternal (Apourushey). Similarly, one should understand about every substance. Therefore, it is proved that one should do Swadhyay only of Sarvjna-pranit Agams.
I

Page #19:
---------------------------
What are the Agamas composed by the omniscient? In the present time, 32 Agamas are considered as proof-level, which preach the teachings of the omniscient and the true substances. The description of the substances in these Agamas is based on proof and Nay. By studying them, the truth of these Agamas and their composers, the omniscient or omniscient-like, are self-evident.
The 32 Agamas in the present time are as follows:
"Se kin tam sammasuan? Jam imam arahantahi bhavamtahi uppanna nanadansanadharehi telukk nirikhia mahia puiehi tiyapaduppanna managaya janayehi savvannahi savvadarisihi paniam duvalasangam ganipidagam tam jaha-ayaro 1 suyagado 2 thanam 3 samavao 4 vivahpannatti 5 nayadhammak hao 6 uvasagadasaao 7 antagadad saao 8 anuttarovawaiyadasaao 9 panhvagaranai 10 vivagasuan 11 ditthivao 12 icce duvalasang ganipidagam coddas puvvis sammasuan abhinna das puvvis sammasuan ten par bhinnesu bhayana se tam sammasuan. Nandi Sutra (Suo 40). 12 Angasastra, 12 Upangasastra, 4 Mulasastra, 4 Chhedasastra and 1 Aavashyak Sutra. But these are 33. One should consider that at this time 11 Angasastra are present; the 12th, Drishtivadaang-sastra, is considered to be separated. The names of the Angasastra are as follows: 1 Acharangashastra, 2 Suyagadangashastra, 3 Sthanangashastra, 4 Samavayangashastra, 5 Vyakhyaprajnapti (Bhagavatishastra), 6 Jnatadharmakathangashastra, 7 Upasakadashangashastra, 8 Antakriddashangashastra, 9 Anuttaroupapatikashastra, 10 Prashnavyakaranashastra, 11 Vipaksastra, 12 Drishtivadaangashastra (which has been separated).
The names of the Upangasastra are as follows: 1 Aupapatikashastra, 2 Rajaprasriyashastra, 3 Jivaabhigamshastra, 4 Prajnapanashastra, 5 Jambudvipprajnapti, 6 Suryaprajnapti, 7 Chandraprajnapti, 8 Nirayavaliao, 9 Kappvadinsiao, 10 Pufiao, 11 Pushpachuliao, 12 Vanhidasaao. And the four Mulasastra are as follows: Dasavaikalikashastra 1, Uttaradhyayanasastra 2, Nandishastra 3, and Bhaktisutra 4.

3, and the Anuyogadwarashastra four Cheda Shastra-Vyavaharashastra 1, Brihatkalpashastra 2, Dasashrutaskandha Shastra 3, Nishit Shastra 4, and the 31st and 32nd Aavashyak Shastra. Thus, 32 Agamas are considered in the present time. But this designation seems to be modern. The reason is that in the Nandi Siddhanta, all the Siddhanta are described in four ways as follows. For example, Angashastra, Utkalikashastra, Kalikashastra and Aavashyakashastra. The Upangasastra and the four original four Cheda Shastra are all included in the Kalik and Utkalik Shastra. See-Nandi Siddhanta-Shrutajnanavishaya.
And in the Aupapatik etc. Shastra, there is no mention anywhere that this is Upangasastra. For example, in the beginning of the Angashastra after the fifth Anga, this passage comes that, Bhagwan Jambuswami Ji says- "O Bhagwan! I have heard the meaning of the sixth Angashastra, but what meaning has Shri Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira Swami described for the seventh Angashastra?" etc. But this style is not seen in the Upangasastra, and the Shastrakar has not called them Upanga. But only in the beginning of the Nirayavalika Sutra, this Sutra is definitely present. And the passage:
"Taenaṁ se Bhagavaṁ Jambū jātasaddhe jāva pajjuvāsamaṇe evaṁ vayāsī-uvagaṇāṁ bhanta! Samaṇeṇaṁ jāva sampattenaṁ ke aṭṭe paṇṇatte? Evaṁ khalu Jambū! Samaṇeṇaṁ Bhagavaya jāva sampattenaṁ, evaṁ uvagaṇāṁ pañcavaggā paṇṇattā. Taṁ jaha-nirayāvaliyāo 1 kappavaḍiṁsiyāo 2 pufiyāo 3 pupphaculliyāo 4 vaṇhidasaō 5"-etc.
After this passage, the study of some of the classes has been described. It cannot be clear from this passage which five classes of Upangas are the Upangas of which Angashastra. Although the Purvacharyas have imagined Anga and Upanga and added Upanga with Anga, but this subject is worth considering. The designation Kalik and Utkalik seems to be very ancient because it is in the Stanangadi Shastra. But the designation Upangadi is also acceptable. Or this subject is worth considering for scholars. Acharya Hemchandra Ji, in his own made 'Abhidhanchintamani' named Kosha, while mentioning the name of Angashastra, has fulfilled the subject by saying only 'Angashastra with Upanga'. But just as

Page #21:
---------------------------
The names of the *Angas* have been mentioned, but it is not written which *Upaanga* belongs to which *Anga*. This also proves that this concept is modern. However, it must be admitted that this concept existed before Abhaydeva Suri or Malayagiri, etc., the commentators. Because the commentators of the *Upaangas* clearly mention in the introduction of their commentaries which *Anga* the *Upaanga* is related to. Therefore, this concept existed even before the time of the commentators; hence, this concept is considered to be universally established in the Svetambara *Aamnaya*.

The faults of *Swadhyaaya* against the rules are fixed for the seven *Swaras* and *Raagas* - at the time of which *Raaga* is fixed, if singing is done at that time, it is certainly enjoyable, and if the *Raaga* is sung against the time, it is not enjoyable; similarly, one should know about the study of the scriptures. And just as the marriage ceremony before the *Vidyarambha* ceremony and the actions of bathing, etc., after eating are not enjoyable, and just as speaking without paying attention to time is considered to be the producer of strife, similarly, *Swadhyaaya* done without rules is not beneficial. And just as people wear clothes on their bodies in the right place - if they are worn without rules and in the opposite limbs, they become worthy of ridicule. Similarly, one should know about *Swadhyaaya*. Therefore, it is proved that *Swadhyaaya* done according to the rules is considered to be conducive to meditation. Just as the above subjects are 'dear' only when done according to the rules, similarly, *Swadhyaaya* done according to the rules is the cause of self-development. The first stage of this scripture has described the subject clearly.

The time of *Swadhyaaya* - *Swadhyaaya* should be done at the time mentioned in the *Aagamas* for *Swadhyaaya*, but *Swadhyaaya* is prohibited during the time of *Anudhyaaya*.

*Manusmriti*, etc., *Smritis* have also described in detail the time of *Anudhyaaya* for *Swadhyaaya*. Because they mention the *Anudhyaayas* of the Vedas. Similarly, ...

---------------------------
Other Ārya scriptures are also considered to be in a period of non-study. But because the Jain Āgamas are all-knowing, divinely ordained, and possess the knowledge of the sounds of the universe, their period of non-study is also mentioned in the Āgamas. For example:

"Ten types of celestial non-study are declared, namely: meteor showers, fire in the sky, thunder, lightning, earthquake, sacrificial post, Yaksha fire, smoke, dust, and dust storms. Ten types of worldly non-study are declared, namely: bones, flesh, blood, impurity, cremation ground, lunar eclipse, solar eclipse, falling, royal war, and worldly death."  *Sthānāṅgasūtra* 10.714.

(Translation) "It is not appropriate for the liberated ones or those who are on the path of liberation to study on the four great new moon days, namely: Āṣāḍha new moon, Indra new moon, Kārttika new moon, and the new moon of the summer solstice. It is not appropriate for the liberated ones or those who are on the path of liberation to study during the four twilight periods, namely: dawn, dusk, midday, and midnight. It is appropriate for the liberated ones or those who are on the path of liberation to study during the four periods of time, namely: morning, afternoon, evening, and early morning." *Sthānāṅgasūtra* 4.2.285.

Page #23:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

**Meaning:** Ten types of *asvadhyaya* (unsuitable time for study) are described due to reasons related to the sky. For example, a meteor shower (falling star): if a large meteor shower occurs, one should not study scriptures for one *prahar* (3 hours) [1]. One should not study scriptures as long as the direction appears red [2]. Similarly, one should understand the following: for two *prahar* when thunder roars [3], for one *prahar* when lightning flashes [4], for two *prahar* when it thunders [5], that is, when there is a loud roar in the sky, whether there are clouds or not, for three days during the *shukla paksha* (bright fortnight) and for three days when the moon is a crescent [6]. As long as a *yaksha* (a celestial being) appears in the sky [7], when there is white smoke [8], when there is black smoke [9], and when there is fog in months like *Magh* (January-February), one should not study scriptures, especially when it is raining [10]. When these reasons are present, one should not study scriptures. However, *asvadhyaya* due to thunder and lightning should not be considered during *chaturmasya* (four months of the rainy season), because thunder and lightning are common during this season. Therefore, *asvadhyaya* is not considered until *Ardra* and *Swati* nakshatras (lunar mansions).

Ten types of *asvadhyaya* also occur due to reasons related to the *oudarik* body (physical body). For example, when a bone is visible [1], when there is flesh nearby [2], when there is blood nearby [3], when there is impurity (excrement, urine, etc.) nearby [4], when one is near a cremation ground [5], during a lunar eclipse for 8, 12, or 16 *prahar* [6], during a solar eclipse for 8, 12, or 16 *prahar* [7], when a great king or other official dies - until their funeral rites are completed or until the new official takes charge, one should study slowly [8], at the battlefield of kings [9], when a five-sense being is killed within the shelter - for example, if someone has killed a pigeon or a rat, and when a human corpse or other corpse is lying within 100 *hasta* (cubits) [10].

One should also not study scriptures during the four great *pratipada* (first day of the lunar month): *Ashadha* *shukla* full moon and *Shravana* *pratipada* [2], *Ashwin* *shukla* full moon and *Kartik* *pratipada* [4], *Kartik* *shukla* full moon and *Margashirsha* *pratipada* [6], *Chaitra* *shukla* full moon and *Vaishakha* *pratipada* [8]. And one hour before sunrise and one hour after sunrise, and one hour before sunset.

Pre
One ghadi before and one ghadi after midday and midnight, one should not perform svādhyāya as before. But in the first prahar of the day and the western prahar, and in the first prahar of the night and the last prahar, one should definitely perform svādhyāya, except for the time of asvādhyāya. Thus, one should perform svādhyāya, excluding 32 types of asvādhyāya time. And in the 12th uddeśa of the Niśītha sūtra, there is this text: _ "Je bhikku cauśu mahāpaḍiveśu sajjhāyam karei karatam vā sāijjai, tam jahā sugimhie pāḍivae, āśāḍhi pāḍivae, bhaddavae pāḍivae, kattie pāḍivae."_
Its meaning is also the same as before, but in this text, Bhādrapada is also included. So, Bhādrasukla pūrṇamāsī and Āśvina kṛṣṇa pratipadā, by increasing in this way for two days, there are 34 asvādhyāya times. Therefore, one should perform svādhyāya, excluding these. In the seventh uddeśa of the Vyavahāra sūtra, while describing the time of svādhyāya and asvādhyāya, both utsarga and apvādamārga are followed. For example,
"No kappati nigganthīṇ vā nigganthāṇ vā vitikitṭāe kāle sajjhāyam uddisittae vā karittae ||14|| Kappati nigganthīṇam vitikitṭāe kāle sajjhāyam uddisittae vā karittae vā nigganthaniśśāe ||15|| No kappati nigganthāṇ vā nigganthīṇ vā asajjhāie sajjhāyam karittae ||16 || Kappati nigganthāṇ vā nigganthīṇ vā sajjhāie sajjhāyam karittae ||17|| No kappati nigganthāṇ vā nigganthīṇ vā appano asajjhāiyam karittae kappati ṇam aṇṇamannassa vāyaṇam dalittae ||18||"
The meaning of these sūtras is only this: - A sādhū or sādhvī should not perform svādhyāya at an inappropriate time. But one should perform svādhyāya only at the appropriate time. If there is mutual recitation going on, then one can perform the act of recitation; that is, one can give recitation even at an inappropriate time. And if blood etc. is flowing from one's body, then one cannot perform svādhyāya, but if that place is properly tied up and blood etc. is not flowing out, then one can mutually

Page #25:
---------------------------
One can be given the reading. In this way, one should strive to study with purity. Now the question arises - is the *asvadhyaya* of the original sutra or also of the *anupreksha* etc.? The answer is that - Abhaydeva Suri, the commentator of the *Thananga Sutra*, while commenting on the four great *pratipada*, writes first:
" *Svādhyāyo nandādi sūtra viṣayo vācanādiḥ anuprekṣā tu na niṣidhyate* "
This statement proves that only the *samhita* is *asvadhyaya*, not the *anupreksha* etc.
The harm of studying during the *asvadhyaya* period is that - due to the *shastra* being *deva-adhisthita* and *deva-vani*, reading with impurity can cause a minor deity to deceive the reader or cause him pain! ( *Eteṣu svādhyāyam kurvatāṁ kṣudradevatā chalanam karoti iti vṛttikāraḥ* ) As a result, there will be great reproach in the worlds. And there is also a possibility of self-contradiction and restraint-contradiction. Or
" *Suya ṇāṇammi abhatti loga viruddhaṁ pamatta chalaṇā ya. Vijjā sāhaṇavegunnadhammaya eva mā kuṇasu ||1||* "
" *Śrutajnāne'bhaktiḥ lokaviruddha tā pramatta chalaṇā ca.
Vidȳāsādhanavaiguṇyadharmatā iti mā kuru. ||* " That is - knowing the reasons, such as failure in the means of knowledge, etc., O disciple! You should not study prematurely. Therefore, it is proved that studying prematurely is forbidden. Just as trees that bear fruit and flower only when their season arrives are considered to produce samadhi in the people. But trees that bear fruit and flower prematurely are considered to produce famine, disease, and state-conflict (quarrel) etc. in the country. Similarly, one should also know about the time and untimely time of study. The reason is that every
work done according to the method is successful. Just as medicine taken on time removes the disease and increases strength, in the same way, study done with devotion and

Page #26:

Self-study done during the time of self-study brings about the destruction of karma and the attainment of peace. 
Therefore,
"Uddeso pasagassa natthi"
Remembering this saying, this topic is concluded here. That is, the wise do not need instruction. He understands his own actions himself. Therefore, it is appropriate for the seekers of liberation to make their lives holy through scriptural self-study and become worthy of liberation. Because the scripture says: -

"Dohiṁ ṭhāṇehiṁ sampanne aṇagāre aṇādīyaṁ aṇavayaggaṁ dīhaṁ addhaṁ cauraṁ tasāṁsārakantāraṁ vītivatejjā, taṁ jahā vijjāe ceva caraṇeṇa ceva."  Sthānāṅgasūtra, Sthāna 2 Uddesaka 1 Sūtra 63
The monk, united by two causes, is free from the beginning, infinite, long, and difficult to cross, the four-fold world of transmigration, like by knowledge and conduct. Therefore, we should strive for the upliftment of the country and religion, making many auspicious beings worthy of liberation, so that there is happiness and peace among the people.  Ityalaṁ vidvadvaryeṣu.

Namo Arihantanam
Preface
Dear Readers!
This world is like a wheel, it has been going on like this since time immemorial. Birth and death are its two main parts. Every creature that is born here is bound to die. Every creature has to come, is coming and will come in the bondage of birth and death according to its karma. In this way, coming into this cycle, the creature experiences various kinds of sorrows and joys. But it is important to remember that the ultimate result of this coming and going is only sorrowful. Liberation is the only way to escape from it. The main door to its attainment is karma-nirjara. Until a creature is able to destroy its karma, attaining liberation is like trying to catch the moon in one's hand. Therefore, to escape from this bondage of birth and death, every creature should turn towards karma-nirjara.
Karma-nirjara cannot happen without right faith, right knowledge and right conduct. These cannot be fully acquired without a human body. To obtain a human birth in the world is not impossible, but it is certainly difficult. If, having obtained a human birth, one spends it like animals in food, sleep, fear and sex, then it should be understood that one has knowingly thrown away a priceless diamond that has come into one's hand. If, due to the karma of previous births, one cannot acquire special knowledge, then with good sense, one should at least use this unparalleled human body

Page #28:
---------------------------
2
One should definitely make a stronger effort to regain it, so that in due time, he may be able to acquire the said right faith, etc., and become capable of his own welfare.
Those individuals who have special क्षयोपशम भाव (feelings of destruction and pacification) automatically attain human birth. But those who do not have these feelings, attain it through good advice. By good advice, we mean the good advice of virtuous men, which requires special effort and practice to obtain. It has been seen in the world that man has a greater inclination towards bad company, and many kinds of advice cannot turn many individuals towards the right path. If the tendencies of the mind are directed towards this from the very beginning, then complete success can be achieved. The company of those individuals from whom virtue, knowledge, etc., can be obtained, can be called good company. Even today, great intelligence and cleverness are needed to identify such individuals. Because many individuals create false pretense and trap innocent youths in their net, pushing them away from the right path and drowning them in the well of the worst company.
I
The said good company has been described in three ways - द्रव्य - सुसंगति (material good company), क्षेत्र सुसंगति (regional good company) and काल- सुसंगति (temporal good company). द्रव्य - सुसंगति is also of three types - सचित्त (conscious), अचित्त (unconscious) and मिश्रित (mixed). सचित्त द्रव्य are living beings like humans, अचित्त are enjoyable objects and मिश्रित are musical instruments like veena, etc. For good company, one should associate with those humans whose conduct is pure and who are believers. Their company brings newness and purity to life. One's knowledge keeps increasing day by day and in due time, he becomes capable of his own welfare. In this way, the scriptures mention five types of knowledge - मति - ज्ञान (intellectual knowledge), श्रुत-ज्ञान (scriptural knowledge), अवधि - ज्ञान (clairvoyance), मनः पर्यव-ज्ञान (knowledge of the mind) and केवल - ज्ञान (omniscience). Among these five, श्रुत - ज्ञान is considered to be the most beneficial. Because when someone continuously listens to the pure Aryan words from the mouth of the guru, then their soul will definitely be affected by them and in this way, after obtaining श्रुत - ज्ञान, the rest of the knowledge can be obtained without much effort and then he will continue to strive to purify his soul.

---------------------------
Therefore, it must be accepted without doubt that Shruta-Jnana is the best because it is the path-guide. The association of Achitt-dravya, pure food, etc. has been mentioned. The person who eats pure and non-edible, i.e., Tamas-free food, his soul certainly accumulates pure thoughts. The person who continuously eats Tamogana-yukt food, his mind does not accumulate good thoughts from good advice. Because the food from which his body is made, it colors his intellect in the same way. Just as even the best swimmers are swept away in a river where there is an abundance of water and speed, in the same way, even the best advice cannot show its strength in the flood of Tamoguna. Nature also tells us that lions and other ferocious animals are considered inferior in the eyes of people, but cows, etc., who eat grass, etc., are worshipped and raised instead of being looked at with a bad eye. This is the reason why pure food calms the mind and makes it incline towards its own welfare. The area where the mind does not generate ill-will and bad thoughts, but it calms down and inclines towards the religious path, is called Kshetra-Susangati. It is certain that the influence of the place definitely affects life. If a person lives near a prostitute's house, even if he is pure, he will definitely lose his morality one day. Similarly, the influence of those who drink alcohol and those who live near thieves will not remain without affecting them. But whoever lives near the virtuous and the righteous, even the worst of the worst will definitely come on the right path one day. Therefore, it is proved that Kshetra-Susangati not only increases the knowledge of pure souls, but also purifies the conduct of even the lowest of the low. In our Bharat-bhoomi, these three Susangatis have been obtained since ancient times. Therefore, the scholars have considered Aryabhoomi to be the best from the point of view of Dharma-Dhyana, even though there are thousands of countries. Kal-Susangati is called that time in which the soul's feelings can remain pure. Every work should be done only at the right time, this is actually Kal-Susangati. There is more possibility of loss instead of profit in doing work without time. If a person wanders at an inappropriate time, he suffers many kinds of losses. In the opposite time, thoughts also arise in the mind, therefore very...

Page #30:
---------------------------
It is possible that working during this famine will harm his good conduct. Nature also tells us that untimely actions not only cause spiritual but also physical harm. For example, if a person eats at an untimely hour, he will lose his health. Secondly, let's say a person goes out to walk in the dark. At this time, many corrupt characters, thieves, robbers, etc., are often lying in wait. By meeting them, he will either become corrupt himself or they will consider him an enemy and harm him. Therefore, this will surely lead to self-reproach and restraint-reproach. It is proven that one should study at the time of study, eat at the time of eating, and perform penance and bodily exercises at the time of penance and bodily exercises. This is the best way. - Emotional harmony is called that which keeps the soul's emotions pure. Emotions are often purified by the study of good scriptures. The study of texts containing excellent and true teachings has a quick and profound effect on the soul. But texts filled with false pomp are not believed in the mind. But it should not be forgotten that in the world, humans have a greater inclination towards bad thoughts than towards good things. We see that people often lean towards arousing scriptures instead of religious scriptures. The result is that they cut their own feet with an axe and lose both this world and the next. Therefore, those who want their true well-being should study scriptures that are entirely beneficial instead of arousing novels, etc., so that their emotions are purified and they can be blessed. Otherwise, studying scriptures that corrupt good conduct will only lead to constant unrest. The study of spiritual scriptures, i.e., scriptures that expound the true nature of things in the style of Syadvada and scriptures that advocate non-violence, purifies emotions more than any other scriptures. The study of these is the best means for this.
When all these harmonies are present, a fire of knowledge is kindled in the soul, which burns the fuel of karma and reveals the nature of the soul covered by them before us. We have already said that it is only by the change in karma that the soul...

Page #31:
---------------------------
The soul forgets its true nature and remains deprived of it until it conquers it again. Just as the sun is inherently luminous but cannot reveal its form when obscured by clouds, so too is the soul. Just as the sun gradually reappears in its true form when the clouds disperse, so too does the soul, upon the attainment of karma-kṣaya or क्षयोपशम, begin to see its pure nature.

However, to become self-aware in this way, one needs certain means. Just as a seed, even with the potential for a sprout, requires means to manifest it, so too does the soul.

These means are the listening to and contemplation of the Dharma-śāstras. The individual who listens to the Dharma-śāstras and practices them with their own understanding, their soul inevitably leans towards self-manifestation, and they do not face any further significant difficulties on this path. Their situation is like that of a lost person being guided back to the right path.

Even so, why do people find it difficult to turn towards this path? The answer is clear: here, one finds neither praise nor condemnation of enemies. Here, one finds a treasure trove of worldly and otherworldly teachings, the fruits of which are attained only after much practice. No one desires to drink bitter medicine. But those who have the courage to drink it become enamored of its qualities. However, those who have a strong क्षयोपशम naturally gravitate towards this path.

As mentioned earlier, Dharma-śāstras are actually the name given to those texts that do not contain stories of wealth or desire, but rather describe the means of liberation and the true nature of things. This is divided into three sections: theoretical, instructive, and historical. It is also said to have four अनुयोग: द्रव्यानुयोग, चरणकरणानुयोग, गणितानुयोग, and धर्मकथानुयोग. Of these, द्रव्यानुयोग deals with theoretical topics, चरणकरणानुयोग with ethical topics, गणितानुयोग with mathematical knowledge, and धर्मकथानुयोग with historical and instructive topics.

I
Remember that the Dharma-Kathānuyoga contains the life stories of those glorious souls who have made their human life successful in every way. Their character is a treasure trove of invaluable teachings for the public. Many individuals have studied their character and practiced it, becoming ideal men like them, and continue to do so. In the practical aspect, a character-based Dharma is considered the main factor in educating the public, because a character-based Dharma is the guide to the path of justice. Keeping this in mind, we present the life of a great sage before our readers. We hope that the readers will surely learn many unique teachings from their life story and try to make their lives successful.
The life story of the great sage that we are about to present is completely modern. Nowadays, people are often retreating from the path of Dharma, and even consider Dharma to be a thorn in the path of their progress. Even in these days of religious revolution, they have proven through their life that the conflicts you are caught in are not real. Dharma alone can provide true peace. Therefore, come towards it, your welfare will be ensured.
You were, Shri 1008 Ganavcchedak Sthavir - पद- विभूषित Shrimad Ganpatiray Ji Maharaj, known by the name Sugrihit. You were born in the city of Pasrur, district Sialkot, on Tuesday, Bhadrapada Krishna Tritiya, Samvat 1906, to Mai Gaurya, the wife of Lala Gurudasmal Shrimal, belonging to the Kashyap Gotra, under the Tripankhiye Gotra. You had four brothers, Nihalchandra, Lalchandra Palamal, and Panjumal, and three sisters, Shrimati Nihaldevi, Palidevi, and Totidevi. Your childhood was spent with great joy. After this, you received education in business matters. Upon reaching adulthood, your marriage ceremony took place in the village of Nunaar in 1624.
After this, you opened a jeweler's shop. Your intellect was very sharp. You examined silver and gold with great skill and keen eyesight. From childhood, you had a special interest in Dharma. This was the reason why you always took special part in every religious festival. You had a natural aversion towards worldly things. You considered worldly pleasures to be a bondage and always tried to break free from this bondage.

Page #33:
---------------------------
They lived. But time is powerful for everything. Until the time comes, even with countless efforts, that thing does not succeed.
Finally, after much waiting, that time came. Once upon a time, you had to go to the place Narowal for some work. While returning from there, you reached the bank of a river called 'Dek'. There was neither a bridge nor any boats on this river. Only a ferryman lived on the bank. He used to ferry the travelers from one side to the other and from the other side to this side. He agreed to ferry you too at your request. Two other men were also going to cross with you. The ferryman took the hands of all three and got into the river. When these people were still in the middle of the river, unfortunately or fortunately, the river flooded. Seeing this, the ferryman ran away to save his life and these poor people started drowning. At that time, understanding that the end was near, you thought that if I escape from this suffering at this time, I will leave the household life and take up the life of a monk. As soon as they thought about this, by divine grace or by the influence of their merits or by the long life-karma, you were pulled to the bank of the river by the force of that strong current. The remaining two companions were swallowed by the jaws of that current-like time.
Upon reaching home, you told everyone about your experience, which, upon hearing, your family members were overjoyed by the repetition of your life. But when you asked for permission to be initiated from them to fulfill your vow, the whole family became anxious and sorrowful. But what was to be done now? They had made a firm vow. Will a swan, once it has attained Mansarovar, desire to return from it? Many family obstacles could not deter them from their resolve. Not getting permission from home, you left worldly pursuits and took up residence in the Jain shrine to live a life dedicated only to religion. At the same time, Shri Dulooray Ji and Shri 1008 Pujya Sohनलाल Ji Maharaj, who were living at their maternal grandfather's house in Pasrur, also started living a religious life to make their lives holy. The mutual contact of these three individuals increased their detachment progressively. Finally, the family members did not hinder their spiritual progress much and they gave permission to these people to be initiated.

Page #34:
---------------------------
Upon receiving the command, you arrived in Amritsar to receive initiation with great enthusiasm, seeking the service of Shri Shri Shri 1008 Acharya-Varya Shri Pujya Amar Singh Ji Maharaj. At that time, Shri Dulooray Ji, Shri Shivdayal Ji, Shri Sohनलाल Ji, and Shri Ganpatiray Ji - these four individuals were together. Seeing them present for initiation, Shri Pujya Acharya Shri Maharaj further strengthened their dispassion and repeatedly imparted knowledge of the impermanence of the world. When their dispassion reached a high level, Shri Maharaj initiated these great souls with great ceremony on the fifth day of the bright fortnight of Margashirsha, Chandravaar, Samvat 1633.

In those days, Shri Pujya Motiram Ji Maharaj was residing in Nalagarh. Shri Pujya Amar Singh Ji Maharaj placed Shri Ganpatiray Ji under his care. Going there, he began to devote all his time to knowledge and meditation. Here, he gained special knowledge of scriptural study and virtuous actions. Your focus on detachment and Guru-bhakti also became similarly engaged. Due to all these qualities, you quickly became renowned throughout the Gachchha or Shri Sangh. Your gentle appearance, humility, and devotion to the virtuous captivated everyone. Along with these qualities, your foresight and brilliance (the ability to use your intellect at the right time) were exceptional. In this way, while upholding virtuous conduct, you performed the following Chaturmas:

Your first Chaturmas, in Samvat 1634, was performed with Shri Pujya Motiram Ji in Kharad city, district Ambala. The second, in Samvat 1635, was in Sialkot; the third in Jammu city; the fourth in Pasrur city; the fifth in Ludhiana city; the sixth in Ambala city (at this time, there were four Thaanes, including Shri 1008 Pujya Sohनलाल Ji Maharaj. At the same time, the Sanvegi Sadhu Atmaram Ji's Chaturmas was also in Ambala city); the seventh, with Pujya Motiram Ji Maharaj, in Nalagarh; and the eighth and ninth in Ludhiana (at this time, Shri Vilasray Ji Maharaj was also residing here, so you also performed Chaturmas here to serve him).

In Samvat 1638, Shrimadacharya Shri 1008 Pujya Amar Singh Ji Maharaj passed away in Amritsar. Therefore, in 1636, the Shri Sangh established Shri Motiram Ji Maharaj as Acharya in Malerkotla. A detailed account of this can be found in the biography of Shri Motiram Ji Maharaj.

Although we are constantly writing about the subject of self-study, the realization of its true benefits compels us to write more on this subject, even though there is a fear of repetition. The more a person studies the scriptures, the greater the impact on their soul, and gradually they will become absorbed in its bliss, naturally progressing towards the destruction of karma. When a person sees the highest fruit before their eyes, they strive to attain it. But first, there is a need for good, well-written, simple, detailed texts with numerous examples and counter-examples to attract the ordinary person's mind. Our present text is one such text. It contains a treasure trove of knowledge in a very beautiful prose style. And each topic is discussed in detail. To understand the knowledge of *asamadhi*, one needs to first understand the knowledge of *samadhi*. Therefore, two types of *samadhi* have been mentioned earlier: *dravya-samadhi* and *bhava-samadhi*. The union with substances due to their equal measure or non-contradictory nature is called *dravya-samadhi*. The knowledge of the proper use of substances, which is the main objective of the education of various arts and crafts, is called *dravya-samadhi*. The other is *bhava-samadhi*. It means to create *samadhi* in the soul through knowledge, vision, and character. When knowledge, etc., accumulates in the soul, an extraordinary peaceful bliss begins to flow through it, and as a result, it begins to attain *samadhi*. - To attain both these types of *samadhi*, a person who desires their own welfare should always strive, so that they can accumulate the means of both worldly happiness and otherworldly progress.

In this way, the sutra-maker has presented before us a vast storehouse of higher education through the mere description of *asamadhi* states. The reader can experience this for themselves. The same applies to other situations. There is no need to say that the main subject matter of this text is only conduct, without which the attainment of knowledge and vision is not impossible, but certainly difficult. Therefore, first of all, by adopting good conduct, knowledge...

One should become a well-established soul with the help of the *Adi*. A soul adorned with *Adi* knowledge can be called a well-established soul.

The author, while explaining the meaning of the word "Sutra", writes:
"Suttam tu suttama eva u ahva suttam tu tam bhave leso athassu yana va". To understand the meaning of the word "Sutra", it is very important to know the meaning of this word (Sutra). It is also paramount to know that the word "Sut" in Prakrit has two meanings: "Supt" and "Sutra". Therefore, the meaning of this sentence is that just as a sleeping man does not understand anything even when spoken to, similarly, without explanation, commentary, or *Bhashya*, the meaning of which is not truly understood, is called a Sutra. In other words, a Sutra describes a lot of meaning in a concise way. Learned scholars, through *Bhashya* and other means, explain its meaning for the common people. Or, just as various materials are collected in a thread, i.e., a Sutra, similarly, a Sutra contains various meanings. Or, the statement made knowingly with a view to benefit the people, i.e., *Sukta*, is called a Sutra. In the Prakrit language, the word "Sut" is also used for *Sukta*. The etymologist, while explaining this word, says:
"Neruttiya itassan suyayi sivvai taheva suvaiitti.
Anusaranthi tiya bheya tassa nama ima huthi." The meaning of this verse is that the one who informs is the Sutra. Because, just as a needle with a thread attached to it can be found even if it is lost, similarly, in the cycle of many events, the Sutra is indicative of the forgotten meaning. Or, just as a needle sews together different pieces of cloth to make a garment like a *Kanchuk* which is very useful and beautiful, similarly, the one who gathers scattered meanings into one form is called a Sutra. Or, just as water flows from the *Chandrakant* gem when it comes in contact with the rays of the moon, and fire flows from the *Surya-kant* gem when it comes in contact with the rays of the sun, similarly, the one from whom the stream of meaning flows...

11.  The name "Sutra" is given to that which leads one out. Or, the name "Sutra" is given to that which helps in removing the eight karmas. Just as a blind person throws out all the garbage from inside the house with the help of a rope or a stick, similarly, with the help of Sutras, the karma-dust of the soul is removed through actions.

The main types of Sutras are: **Sanjna Sutra**, **Karaka Sutra**, and **Prakarana Sutra**. There are two further divisions: **Utsarga** and **Apavada**. 

**Sanjna Sutra** refers to those that provide general instructions on any meaning. For example: 
"Je chhe'e se sagariyam pariyahare taha savvamgandhaparinnaya niramgandho parivva'e" - meaning, "He who is skillful, abandons sexual intercourse, knowing it through knowledge-perception, renounces it through rejection-perception, and conducts himself with a pure mind." This is a Sanjna Sutra.

**Karaka Sutra** refers to those that describe actions. For example: "Ahakamm'am bhuj'amane samane nigganth'e kai kamm'a pagadio bandhai? Goyama! A'uvaj'ja'o satt'a kamm'a pagadio... se k'en'te'n'am bhan'te! Evam vucch'ai" - meaning, "While eating, how many karma-knots are tied to the monk, the Niggantha? It is said, "Seven karma-knots are tied..." etc.

**Prakarana Sutra** refers to those that provide knowledge of a particular topic through its name, such as "Namipravjya," "Gautama Keshiya," etc. These are the three main types of Sutras.

Each of these has two further divisions: **Utsarga** and **Apavada**. **Utsarga Sutra** refers to those that provide general rules for any action. For example: "No kapp'ai nigganth'a'n'a va nigganth'i'n'a va ame talapalamb'e abhinne padiggh'itt'ae" - meaning, "It is not permissible for the Niggantha or the Nigganthi to take unripe, unsplit dates from the palm tree." However, **Apavada Sutra**, which contradicts the Utsarga rule, states: "Kapp'ai nigganth'a'n'a nigganth'i'n'a va pakke talapalamb'e bhinne'abhinne padiggh'itt'ae" - meaning, "It is permissible for the Niggantha or the Nigganthi to take ripe, split or unsplit dates from the palm tree." This is another division of Sutras: Utsarga and Apavada. It means that even though a substance is prohibited, it is permitted for a specific purpose. For example, the first Purushi...

Butter (ghee) and other such substances should not be kept beyond the fourth watch of the night, but they can be kept if there is a special compelling reason. In addition to this, there is another distinction in the form of an exception. In fact, there are many types of secondary distinctions. For example, Samasa Sutra, Akhyata Sutra, Taddhita Sutra and Nirukta Sutra, etc.

Therefore, the study of any Sutra should be done with knowledge of its distinctions and sub-distinctions. Knowledge of these distinctions makes it easier to understand the meaning of the Sutra. A seeker of true good conduct should have a good understanding of both the Sutra and its meaning, only then can he attain the desired success. We have already written that without purposeful study, no one can succeed in that subject. Therefore, studying with proper knowledge of both the Sutra and its meaning can be the means of achieving special results.

If a person has this curiosity in his mind that whether this Sutra has been given a Mangalacharan at the beginning or not. He should not forget this point first of all that the original creator of all the scriptures is Lord Arhan Bhagwan himself. Since they are created by him, they are all auspicious in nature. Mangalacharan is done for the worship of the desired deity. Where the creator himself is the desired deity, what is the need for other auspiciousness? This doubt may arise that it is true that the original creator is Lord Bhagwan himself. But the Sutras were composed by the Ganadharas, then they must have remembered their desired deity by Mangalacharan? It is true, but it should be kept in mind that the Ganadharas have only translated the meaning of the Agam, which was propounded by Lord Bhagwan, in the form of a Sutra. Therefore, they also did not consider it necessary to do any kind of auspiciousness to express the meaning propounded by Bhagwan.

Or this scripture is quoted from Anga and Poona. Therefore, every letter of it is auspicious. Even then, there may be a doubt that if the Ganadharas themselves did not feel any need for it, then they should have done something auspicious at the beginning, middle and end for the sake of good conduct and the education of the disciple tradition.

Why? To address their solution, we can say that all three auspiciousness are present in this for the removal of obstacles. For example, in the sentence "Suyam me ausan" etc., the translation of the words of Shri Bhagwan is auspiciousness itself, and in the second, the word "Suyam" is taken as "Shruti" knowledge, therefore, the remembrance of Shruti is also auspiciousness. Whoever has a special curiosity in this matter should study "Nandi Sutra" for the fulfillment of their curiosity. _ The middle auspiciousness is the study of Paryushana Kalpa, because this study describes the life story of Arhan Bhagwan, which is always auspicious. Or the sadhus who follow the orders of Arhan Bhagwans are also auspicious, because auspiciousness has been described in four ways. For example, "Chattari Mangalam Arihanta-Mangalam, Siddha Mangalam, Saahu Mangalam, Kevalipannatto Dhammo Mangalam."
The final auspiciousness is the sentence "Tenam Kalena Tenam Samaena Samane Bhagavan Mahavir" etc. Therefore, in the practical aspect, all three auspiciousness are present in this. Of these three auspiciousness, the first auspiciousness is for the removal of obstacles, the middle auspiciousness is for the destruction of long-accumulated sins, and the final auspiciousness is for stabilizing the disciples in the scriptures. But in reality, all scriptures are auspicious, because with their help, the soul crosses the ocean of the world and attains the auspicious state of Siddha. The means to attain that state are right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct, which are described in this Sutra, therefore, the study of the entire Sutra is auspicious. The purpose of translating this Sutra has already been mentioned that this Sutra particularly describes the main aspect of Dharma, conduct, and at the same time, it is also indicative of right knowledge, right conduct, and right faith. Therefore, it should be studied. In our opinion, it is well understood that during the days of Paryushana, this Sutra should be studied in place of or along with Kalpa Sutra and Antagad Sutra.
1 What is the meaning of the word Mangalam? It is said that "Agiragilgivagimgaiti" is the root of the Dandaka verb, from which the root "Num" is derived. In the "Num" verb, the "Kalacha" suffix is added, and after the deletion of the suffix, the form "Mangalam" is obtained in the first singular. Mangalam means that which is beneficial. It means that which is acquired, achieved, or accomplished. Or, "Mang" is the name of Dharma, and in the "Ladana" verb, the "Mang" is the upasarga, and the "Ka" suffix is added, and after the deletion of the suffix, the "A" is deleted by the rule "Ato Lopa Iti Cha", and the form "Mangalam" is obtained in the first singular. Mangam Latiti Mangalam means that which is the cause of the production of Dharma. Mangalam means that which liberates from the world. This is the explanation.

Reading is also essential because this Sutra is extremely instructive for both ascetics and householders. Almost all kinds of activities are expounded in it, from which the Sangha can benefit greatly by studying and listening to it. And the life story of Lord Mahavira Swami is also briefly described in the eighth study of this Sutra. Therefore, the author of the Kalpasutra has written that this text is quoted from the eighth study of the Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra. Or it should be said that the Kalpasutra is only the eighth study of this Sutra. Along with this, it should be kept in mind that the eight days of Paryushana Kalpa are not only for the offering of sweets etc., but also during those days, one should acquire the highest education, which can be well obtained by studying and listening to this Sutra. By this, one not only liberates oneself from the world, but also becomes capable of liberating other souls.
Therefore, seeing such a treasure trove of high education, it occurred to our mind that its translation into Hindi language should be done for the common people. Although many commentaries in Gujarati-Marwari language are found and the Sanskrit commentary written by Shriman Matakirtigani is also available. But now the progress of Hindi is seen day by day and every province is adopting it. Therefore, with the aim that everyone can benefit from it, this effort has been made. For those who are fond of Sanskrit, the original Sutra along with the Sanskrit shadow has also been given, so that they do not have any confusion in knowing the Prakrit words.
Reason for naming the commentary - This Hindi language commentary has been named 'Ganapati Gun Prakashka'. The reason for this is that my initiation guru is Shri Shri Shri 1008 Swami Ganavchhedak Sthavirpad-Vibhushit Shri Ganpatiray Ji Maharaj, whose brief life story has been given in the preface. This commentary has been made in memory of him. You were a gentle soul, farsighted and a well-wisher of the Shri Sangha. You spent your whole life in obedience to the Jains. You also had immense grace on this servant. You have introduced this servant to the elements of Dharma. Therefore, being fascinated by your qualities, remembering your immense kindness

This humble servant has named this commentary after you. It is a matter of joy that the commentary 'Sri Ganapati Gunaprakashika' has been completed without any obstacles due to the glory of your name.

**Basis of the Commentary**

While writing this commentary, I had one Sanskrit commentary and two handwritten copies in Gujarati language with meanings. This commentary has been created based on them. If there is any error in meaning or text, even after continuous efforts, then learned people, following the saying 'Samadadhati Sajjana:', should correct it themselves and inform me, making me indebted to them for eternity.

It was against our tradition. Therefore, when I discussed this matter with Pandit Pravar Shri Jagat Prasad Tripathi Ji, he suggested that it would be best to publish the Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra of Acharya Samrat Pujya Shri Atmaram Ji Maharaj.
The words of Pujya Pitamaha Gurudev Uttar Bharatiya Pravartak Bhandari Shri Padam Chand Ji Maharaj echoed in my memory, which he had told me years ago, "Suvrat Muni Ji, you should study, contemplate and meditate on the Jinvani, especially the works of Pujya Shri Atmaram Ji Maharaj, and spread them." Remembering this filled my body and mind with immense gratitude towards Pujya Pitamaha Guruvar.
When I discussed this matter with Pujya Gurudev Aagam Diwakar Up Pravartak Shri Amar Muni Ji Maharaj, who is creating an unprecedented historical work by publishing Jain Agams with Hindi-English translations and illustrations, he said that yes, the said Sutra is published and is now unavailable, but it is very good. This made me very happy and strengthened my desire to publish the Sutra.
I
Upashraya
The search for the old published copy began, which ultimately led to the acquisition of an old copy of the Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra from Kolhapur House Jain Virajit Mahasati Shri Swarnakant Ji. I studied it diligently. This polished and developed my faith. The work of giving concrete form to the desire to publish the Sutra began.
We have received the holy darshan and encouragement of Pujya Gurudev Aagam Diwakar Up Pravartak Shri Amar Muni Ji Maharaj in this Aagam compilation. This is the seed of power that drives us in this important work. Instead of expressing gratitude to Gurudev and feeling relieved, it is better to receive the power of his blessings for future work and become even more grateful.
Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra: - It means that which describes the various states of seekers - that is - states, Skandha means - group. It is also called Chhed Sutra. While explaining the religious meaning of the word Chhed, the Acharyas have written that those external actions which do not hinder religion and which increase purity are called Chhed, or where violence, theft, etc. are abandoned with discrimination,

It goes and when the vow is broken, it is purified by its atonement, etc. It is called Chhedopasthapana Charitra. All these things are described in this scripture. Therefore, Acharya Dev Pujya Shri Atmaramji Maharaj also probably wrote a commentary on this scripture first and this scripture was published first. When the discussion of its publication took place, Shri Sunil Garg said that this book was published a long time ago. Therefore, due to the yellowing of the paper, it would be better to re-compose and print it. In the same way, the entire process of printing was completed, so this scripture was studied many times. The corrections of inaccuracies were made, the language and the sentiments were not changed even a little bit.
All the press related works were done with great enthusiasm by Guru Bhakta Shri Sunil Garg Narayana Delhi, yet some obstacles kept coming. The biggest obstacle was the sudden passing away of Pujya Pitamaha Gurudev Uttar Bharatiya Pravartak Bhandari Shri Padamchandraji Maharaj on May 1st. Due to that, all the work became chaotic. However, the mind was comforted by the fact that they were completing the work that he had told them to do. The work was started again.
For the completion of any work, there is a need for money, so in this too, there was a great need for financial assistance, which was received in the memory of Maharaj from his devotees in the form of a significant contribution, and that too in the form of a secret donation. Therefore, heartfelt congratulations to all of them.
This work was completed with the great grace of Pujya Gurudev Upravartak Aagam Diwakar Shri Amarmuniji Maharaj. With his grace, financial assistance was also received generously from both the families of his world and religion on the occasion of the initiation of Shri Varunmuniji Maharaj. Therefore, we are especially grateful to Pujya Gurudev.
In addition to this, all those generous noble souls who have contributed their money are worthy of congratulations. Along with this, the service assistance of Vidya Rasik Shri Vikasitmuniji in this work is also memorable. The cooperation of Pandit Pravar Shri Jagat Prasadji Tripathiji in the form of useful advice in the proof correction of this scripture and many other matters has also been commendable. Shri Sunil Garg, who has done the press related work...

All duties have been performed with utmost devotion, they too are worthy of congratulations and blessings.
The mention of the tradition of contribution in the collective effort of those moving at the same pace towards one goal is merely a fulfillment of behavior. In reality, it is our sacred duty and we have all followed it.
This scripture has been edited with full awareness, yet human knowledge is limited, therefore some error is bound to remain. Therefore, we request knowledgeable readers to correct the errors and read them, and also inform us, making us grateful.

**Blessings**

"**Puja Gurudev Uttar Bharatiya Pravartak Rashtra Sant**" Bhagwan says - "**Khanbhit Sukkha, Bahukal Dukkha**" meaning that worldly possessions provide momentary happiness but long-lasting suffering. This message, born from spiritual contemplation, remains as relevant and useful today as it was in the past, guiding human life towards eternal happiness.

Our India, though primarily agricultural, has always been fundamentally a land of **Rishis**. Our entire past bears witness to the fact that from the very beginning, the **Maharshis** and **Acharyas** here, through their **tapo-maap** and **atmaradhan**, have created that spiritual light, in whose divine radiance the entire human society of the world can gain inner vision and move life in the right direction.

The **Jain Agamas**, containing messages and teachings for the creation, upliftment, and well-being of life, were written in the language of their time, making them inaccessible to the common people. Therefore, from time to time, many **Acharyas** translated them into the language of the time, making them useful for the common people. One such great **Acharya** was **Param Pujya Acharya Shri Atmaram Ji Maharaj**, who not only translated the **Jain Agamas** into Sanskrit and Hindi but also wrote detailed Hindi commentaries in Hindi, making them accessible to all for their benefit and happiness. These **Agamas** with Hindi commentaries were published about 40 years ago, but they are now becoming unavailable. My disciples...

It is a matter of great joy that Dr. Suvrat Muni Shastri has taken interest in republishing the Agamas. First, through his efforts, the Nandi Sutra was published, and now he is publishing the Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra. This is definitely a commendable work, which is a symbol of *Jina Shasana* influence and Guru Bhakti. For this, I offer my heartfelt blessings to Dr. Suvrat Muni Ji. May he continue to spread the influence of *Jina Shasana* with even greater zeal. My best wishes are always with him.

## Introduction

It has been clarified in the preface that purification of the soul can only be achieved through the study of scriptures. These scriptures are divided into four sections - Charan Karananuyog, Dharmanuyog, Ganitanuyog and Dravyanuyog. The Charan Karananuyog is described in the Kalik Shruti etc., the Dharmanuyog is described in the Rishi-Bhashit etc. sutras, the Ganitanuyog is described in the Surya-Pragyapti etc. sutras and the Dravyanuyog is fully described in the Drishti-Vadang. In addition, some information about Dravyanuyog is also found in the Ang or Upang etc. sutras.

Here, we need to specifically discuss the Charan Karananuyog, as our present scripture 'Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra' is particularly related to it.

Before we discuss the present text, it seems necessary to say something about 'Shruta Adhyayan'. We have already said that 'Shruti' is the name of religious scriptures. The texts that describe principles, teachings and conduct are called religious scriptures or Shruti. From a practical perspective, conduct should be given the first place. Because, how can the mind of a person whose conduct is not pure be focused on the subject of principles? Teaching seems impossible for him. Because only the person whose conduct is pure has an impact on the people. If a drunkard advises others not to drink alcohol, the listeners will look at him with disgust instead of respect. But the person whose conduct is pure, even without saying anything, people will serve and worship him.

Page #54:
---------------------------
She desires to drink the nectar of teachings from his mouth and strives to follow whatever he says. Therefore, one should first study the texts on conduct. Only then can one succeed in the remaining two subjects, namely, principles and teachings. It has been established that purity of thought cannot be achieved without the study of scriptures, and among the scriptures, the study of scriptures on conduct should be undertaken first.

This conduct has been stated to be of two types - virtuous conduct and householder conduct. The rules of conduct for the virtuous are called virtuous conduct, and the rules for householders are called householder conduct. It is highly beneficial to study the texts that describe both types of conduct. The sutra that we have explained here is one such text.

For the study of this sutra and especially for gaining knowledge, it is very important to know the concepts of undertaking, perspective, and deposit from the Anuyogadvara Sutra, as there is a need for a brief introduction to these topics at various places in this text.

This text or sutra is called the "Dasashrutaskandha Sutra". It is also mentioned in the tenth chapter of the "Sthananga Sutra" under the name "Acharadasha". For example, "Ayaradasanam dasa panchavis pariyae samane nigganthae ayaracusale sanjamakusale pavayanakusale pannattiakusale sanghakusale uvaggahakusale akkhuyaayare asabalaayare abhinnayare asankiliṭṭhaayare charitte bahusue babbhagame jahannena dasakappavavhaare kappati ayariy uvjjaayattaae uddisittae. (Vyavahar Sutra Uddes 3 Su 5) Panchavis vase pariyaayass samanas nigganthass kappati dasakappa vavharanama ajjhayane uddisittae va. (Vyavahar Su U Su 28) Chabbisan dasa kappa vavharaanam uddeasanakala pa ta da dasadasanam cha kappass dasa vavharass. (Samavayanga Su Samavay 16) Thananga Su Sthan 6 Padmachariṭaprashnavyakaran Su Panchva Sanvardvaruttaradhyayan Su A 36 Ga 67"

Adhyayana Pannatta

This includes:
- Twenty-two Asamahitthana (states of non-concentration)
- Twenty-one Sabala (with impurities)
- Thirty-three Asayana (abodes)
- Eight types of Ganisampaya (association of ascetics)
- Ten Cittasamahitthana (states of mental concentration)
- Eleven Uvasakappatima (lay follower's vows)
- Twelve Bhikkhupatima (monk's vows)
- Paccosavana-kappa (recitation ceremony)
- Thirty Mohanijja-thana (delusion-inducing situations)
- Ajaiitthana (birthplace)

The text of this 'Adhyayana-vivarna' (description of study) indicates that the text which describes the five conduct-related practices is called Acaradasa. This same description is found in the Dasasrutaskandha-sutra without any changes. Therefore, it must be concluded that 'Acaradasa' is another name for the same text.

The author's conclusion is that although from the perspective of Arthagama, all scriptures are spoken by the venerable Lord Arhat, yet from the perspective of Sutragama, they are spoken by the Ganadhara, Sthavira, and even by each Buddha, etc. The authenticity of all these is accepted on the basis of the Anga scriptures. And the detailed explanations of the topics found in the Anga scriptures are seen in the Upanga scriptures. Now we have to decide who has presented this in the form of a sutra. While writing the commentary on this sutra, the commentator Matikirttigani writes about the word 'Anuyoga' - "Even the Ganadhara made its initial composition, therefore, the Dasasrutaskandha, which expounds it, is taken up as an Anuyoga. The explanation of the Dasasruta is the Dasasrutaskandha-anuyoga. The connection of the meaning after the sutra is Anuyoga, i.e. the study of the meaning after the sutra."

Page #56:
---------------------------
"Yoga Anuyoga." This statement implies that the Ganadharas were the first to compile the Sutras, therefore the Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra is also attributed to the Ganadharas. This statement proves that, like other Sutras, this Sutra was also composed by the Ganadharas. However, the doubt arises that while the beginning of other Sutras attributed to the Ganadharas only contain the text "Suyam me Ausam Tenam Bhagavaya Evam Akhayam," this Sutra begins with the longer text "Iha Khalu Therahin Bhagavantehin Visati Asamahithana Pannaatta." This suggests that the Theras (elders) compiled the Sutras on conduct from the Sutras attributed to the Ganadharas and created this Sutra for the understanding of new disciples, as the role of the Theras is clearly evident in this Sutra. The agent of the verb "Prajnapta" here is the Theras, not the Ganadharas. The commentator also concludes that this Sutra was edited by Shri Bhadrabahu Swami Maharaj. He clarifies this point in the following commentary on the same Sutra: "Suyam me" etc. - the meaning of the Sutra is explained - Bhagavan Bhadrabahu Swami tells his disciple Sthulabhadra: "Shrutamaakarnitam Guruparyayena, Me - Maya, Ausanti - Aayurjeevitam Tatsanyam Pradhanataya Prashasta Prabhutam Yasya Sa Aayushman, Tasyamantaranam He Aayushman! Shishya! Tenantiya Sannihit-Vyavahit-Sukshma-Sthula-Bahya-Adhyatma-Ekasakala-Padartheshv Avyahat-Vachanataya-Aptatvena Jagati Pratiit-Stena Mahavirena Bhagavata Jnanaadyaishvaryayute Naivaamuna Vakyamanena Vimsatyadina Prakarena - Khyatam-Asankirna-Ashraddha-Sadhukaraneya-Lakshanarupena Vidhina-Athava Heyopadeya-Rupa-Samasta-Vastu-Vistara-Lakshnena Vyapara-Lakshnena-Akyatam-Kathitam-Iharhadvachane Khalu Vakyalankare Sthavirairganadharai Sudharma-Jambu-Bhadrabahaadi-Shruta-Kevali-Bhir-Visati-Asamadhi-Sthanani Asamadher-Asama-Dhanasya Sthanani Padani Prajnaptaani Pratipaditaani Iti." In this commentary, the word "Sthavira" refers to all the Shruta-Kevalis, including Sudharmaswami, Jambuswami, and Bhadrabahu. The commentator of the Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra also supports this view. He writes: "Vandami Bhaddabahum Paainam Charimasayalasuyanaanim Suttasas Karagamisan Dasasu Kappe Ya Vavahare." This means that I bow to Shri Bhadrabahu Swami, the ultimate knower of all scriptures, and the author of the Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra, Brihatkalpa, and Vyavahar Sutra. Matikirti Gani Ji, while writing a commentary on this, further clarifies this point. This commentary also resolves many other doubts. Therefore, for the convenience of our readers, we are also providing that commentary here:

"I bow to Bhadrabahu, born of an ancient lineage, the ultimate knower of all scriptures, meaning the one who has attained omniscience (Shruta Kevali). He is the compiler of the Sutras, the ten Shruta Skandhas, the Brihat Kalpa, and the Vyavahara. The compilation of these is the essence of the Sutras. It is said that these were compiled by fourteen predecessors, as follows: Suttam, Ganahara, Raiyam, Tatheva, Patteya Buddharaiyam, Sukevalina Raiyam, Abhinna Dasapugvina Raiyam. Now, even though the Shravaka has attained the status of a Sutra due to the same authorship of the Nirukti and other Daniruktis, the same applies to the Apadyatas, as they are also included in the Sutra-like presentation of the Samvayaanga. For example, Acharassa nam paritta vayana sankhijjana anuo gadara sankhijjanao padivattiyo sankhijjana vedha, sankhijjana siloga sankhijjanao nijjuttiyo. Se nam angaththayae padhame ange do suyaka khandha bissan ajjhayanetiyadi vachanaadinaancha charaangasarup nirupane nacharaangattvamuktam. Thus, the Sutra-hood of the Nirukti is self-evident. Therefore, it is said that the Anuyoga Dvara Sutra is the Nirukti, as the Nirukti is also the Anuyoga. This is not a mere coincidence, but rather a necessity. Therefore, we bow to him. He is said to be the compiler of the Sutras, not the author of the meaning. The meaning is derived from the Tirthankaras, as it is said, "Attham bhasai ariha suttam ganthanti ganahara niunam sasanas sa hiyatthae tao suttam pavattaiti." The Sutras, the ten Kalpas, and the Vyavahara, from where did they come? It is said that they are authentic, as they are not contradicted by any previous accounts. This verse was likely composed by some Acharya who was a proponent of the Nirukti and Anuyoga, and who, while teaching the Nirukti and Anuyoga to his disciples, presented this lineage to demonstrate the authorship of the ten Shruta Skandhas, etc., and to pay homage to Shri Bhadrabahu. This is likely because it is not appropriate for someone to praise themselves. Great people do not praise themselves in their own words, as it is unbecoming of them. It is seen that in their own words, they praise the lineage of teachers and disciples who are true propagators of truth, as in the accounts of Sudharma Jambusvami, etc., who are known for their Dharmakatha, etc., as written by Prabhava, etc., as in "Titthayaare bhantae," etc. In this way, in this commentary, Shri Bhadrabahu Swami is considered to be the compiler of this Sutra. In addition, at the end of the tenth Dasha, the commentator writes, "Swamanishika pariharaaya bhagavan bhadrabahuswami praha tenam kalena tenam samaena," etc. This statement clearly proves that everything that Bhadrabahu Swami has described is merely a translation of the words of Shri Shraman Bhagavan Mahavira Swami. He did not say anything from his own intellect. This is also made clear at the end of each Dasha. From the above description, there is no doubt left in the minds of the readers that the true originator of this Sutra is Shri Shraman Bhagavan Mahavira Swami.

Page #58:
---------------------------
They are. But to preserve this statement of his in the disciple-tradition, it was compiled. Sri Bhadrabahu Swami did it.
The basis of the composition is the names of the texts on which this sutra is based, according to the ten chapters, we give below for the convenience of the readers:
In this, a large part has been taken from the Samavayanga Sutra with only a few changes, such as the description of twenty asamadhi-sthana in the first chapter. All this has been quoted from the 'Samavayanga Sutra' in the form of a sutra from the twentieth chapter. The only difference is that in the 'Samavayanga Sutra', the description of the asamadhi-sthana has been started by giving only the text 'Vīsāsamāhiṭhāṇā paṇṇattā taṁ jahā', but here the text 'Suyaṁ me āusaṁ teṇaṁ' etc. has been added along with the said text. In the second, the place has also been changed in some places. Apart from this, no other difference is found in them.
The twenty-one 'shabala-dosha' of the second chapter have also been quoted verbatim from the Samavayanga Sutra. The difference is only in the introductory sentence like the first chapter. The 'ashasana' of the third chapter have also been taken from this sutra in the same form.
The fourth chapter describes eight types of 'gani-sampat'. The mere name-designation of these eight types of wealth is described in the eighth chapter of the 'Sthananga Sutra'. Nothing special has been said about it there. Therefore, all the other differences, teachings found here and the special features of the description have been collected from some other sutra.
The fifth chapter describes 'chitta-samadhis'. Only the introductory part has been taken from the Aupapatik Sutra in a concise form. After this, the prose text of the ten chitta-samadhis has been quoted from the tenth chapter of the Samavayanga Sutra and the remaining verse part seems to have been collected from some other sutra.
The sixth chapter describes the eleven images of the Shramanopasaka. Its 6. The original text in the form of a sutra has also been collected from the eleventh chapter of the Samavayanga Sutra.

- However, its detailed explanation has been taken from other Sutras. In the description of Akriya-vada, a lot of text has been taken from the second Sutra of the second study of the 'Suyagdang Sutra' from the Adharmapaksa. Similarly, while describing the place of thirteen actions, a lot of text has been collected from the place of action of Lobha-pratyaya. The remaining text has been quoted from other Sutras.
In the seventh dasha, there is a description of twelve Bhikṣu-pratima. In this, the original Samvayanga has been taken from the twelfth place and the detailed explanation has been taken from the third place of the Bhaga Sthananga Sutra and the Bhagavati Antagad etc. Sutras.
In the eighth dasha, there is a description of the five Kalyanas of Shri Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira Swami. The name of this dasha is Paryushana Kalpa. The original Sutra of this dasha has been collected from the first uddeshya of the fifth place of the Sthananga Sutra. This same text is also found in the twenty-fourth study of the second Shruta-skandha of the Acharanga Sutra and in the beginning of the Kalpasutra.
In the ninth dasha, thirty Mahamohaniya places have been described. Its upoddhat part has been quoted from the Aupapatik Sutra and the description of thirty Mahamohaniya places in the form of a verse has been quoted from the thirtieth place of the Samvayanga Sutra.
In the tenth dasha, nine types of Nidana Karmas have been described. Its upoddhat has been taken briefly from the Aupapatik Sutra and the remaining text seems to have been taken from the Aupapatik Sutra or the Suyagdang Sutra, the second Shruta-skandha, or from other texts. And the description of nine Nidana Karmas has been collected from some other Jain Agam. Because many Agam have also been destroyed.
These are the basis-texts of this composition. It is clear from this that Shri Bhadrabahu Swami, who edited this Sutra, did not add anything from his side in this Sutra. He compiled this Sutra on the subject of conduct based on the Angadi Sutras for the benefit of the people. Rather, you could say that he has collected the text on the subject of conduct from the said Anga Sutras in one place. His objective in compiling this Sutra, as we have said, was only to improve the conduct of the disciple-community and the people. After editing it, he placed it on place-2.

This was publicized so that the public could find a repository of knowledge on conduct in one place and not have to wander around aimlessly for it.
We have already said that conduct is the most important aspect of religion. One must acquire knowledge of it. Without studying religious texts, the true faith of many individuals is led astray by misleading knowledge, therefore, to dispel confusion, one must first acquire true knowledge, which is not possible without self-study or listening to the texts on the subject. It is appropriate for self-benefiting individuals to study this unique text once for the sake of purity of conduct, so that their conduct may become pure and they may also progress towards the path of liberation.
This curiosity may arise in the minds of the readers that whether the Niyutikar has also written something on this subject that Shri Bhadrabahu Swami has quoted from a certain place in a certain text. For their satisfaction, we consider it necessary to state that the Niyutikar's intention has been clarified by the commentator in the following words: "Tatra Tirthankarasya Samayikadhikrameṇa Upodghātaḥ Kṛtaḥ. Āryasudharmāṇo Jambūsvāminah Prabhavasya Shayyaṁbhavasya Yaśobhadrasya Sambhūtavijayasya Tato Bhadrabahoravasarpiṇyāṁ Puruṣāṇām Āyurbhalayorhāniṁ Jñātvā Cintā Samutpannā Pūrvagate Vyucchinnē Viśodhim Na Jñāsyantīti Kṛtvā Pratyākyānāpūrvād Daśākalpavyavahārānniryūḍa Eṣa Upodghātaḥ" etc. It is proved by the statement that Shri Bhadrabahu Swami, from the beginning of the rejection, has extracted the Daśāśrutaśkandha, Bṛhatkalpa and Vyavahāra Sūtras, i.e., he has collected the topics of conduct etc. from different Sūtra texts and presented them to the public in the form of a new text.
Regarding the decision of the substance, the commentator writes: "Iha Kil Bhadrabahuḥ Svāmī Caturdaśapūrvadharasthūlabhadrasvāminam Svaśiṣyaṁ Pratīpādayāñcākāra - Śrutam Ākarnitam, Guruparamparayetyādi” Where the Daśā ends, there (tti bemi' on this word, the commentator writes: "Iti Bravīmi Yad Bhagavatā Sarvavidopadishṭam Mayākarnitam Iti Tadhamapī Bhadrabahusvāmi Pratīpādayāmīti Bhāvaḥ" This statement also clearly proves that Shri Bhadrabahu Swami has quoted the words of Shri Bhagavan, and that too from the beginning of the rejection. Therefore, this Sūtra is completely authentic and in fact, it was composed by the Gaṇadharas.

The tenth *chintavali* was in Patiala state, the eleventh *fir* was with revered Motiramji Maharaj in Nalagarh, the twelfth in Machhiwara, the thirteenth in Patiala city, the fourteenth in Raikot city, the fifteenth in Faridkot, the sixteenth in Patiala, the seventeenth in Malerkotla, the eighteenth in Ambala city, and the nineteenth was performed in Ludhiana in Samvat 1952.

At this time, the revered Acharya, the ocean of forgiveness, revered Motiramji Maharaj, due to weakness in his legs, remained in Ludhiana city. Then, to serve the Maharaj, you performed all the *chaturmas* from Samvat 1653 to 1658 in Ludhiana. The account of the growth of religion during these *chaturmas* has been written in the biography of revered Motiramji Maharaj. When revered Motiramji Maharaj attained heavenly abode on Ashwin Krishna Chaturdashi, after the *chaturmas*, you gave the mantle of the Acharya position to Shri Shri Shri 1008 Sohनलालji Maharaj, as per the order of Shri 1008 Acharya Motiramji. At that time, Shri 1008 Swami Lalchandraji Maharaj was residing in Patiala.

After completing this task, you traveled towards Ambala and Sadaura. Then, you went through Sadaura, Ambala, Patiala, Nabha, Malerkotla, Raikot, Firozpur, Kasur, and Lahore, reaching Gujranwala. Due to the strong request from the devotees of Rawalpindi, you traveled there. On the way, you passed through Wazirabad, Kunjah, Jehlum, Rohtas, and Kallar, reaching Rawalpindi. This year, you performed *chaturmas* here with your *muniparivar*. In this *chaturmas*, there was a great deal of religious preaching compared to other years. After the *chaturmas*, you traveled from there, preaching religion along the way, and reached Sialkot. Here too, there was a great celebration of religious preaching, and seeing the great request of the devotees, you accepted their plea and performed the *chaturmas* of 1660 in Sialkot. Before the *chaturmas*, you also preached religion in Amritsar and other areas. After the *chaturmas*, you returned to Amritsar. At this time, revered Acharya Sohनलालji Maharaj, Marwari Sadhu Shri Devidासji Maharaj, and many other Sadhus and Sadhvis were gathered there. At this time, many titles were conferred in the *gachchh*, and you were adorned with the title of "Shrimad Ganavच्छेदक Sthavir Pad".

10. At this time, you were suddenly afflicted by asthma. This caused a great hindrance to your travels. Therefore, you spent the Chaturmas of 1661 in the city of Faridkot. From there, you traveled and spent the Chaturmas of 1662 in Patiala and the Chaturmas of 1663 in the city of Ambala. You spent the Chaturmas of 1664 in the city of Ropar. During this Chaturmas, many non-Jain people received great religious benefit. The people of the city became devoted to your service and began to earn religious merit. Unfortunately, despite many attempts to cure the respiratory illness, it did not subside. Seeing this, the people requested you to stay permanently. However, you did not accept this and continued to travel with your own strength. Many times, when you had a severe asthma attack on the road, your disciples would carry you in a palanquin made of cloth and enter the city. You remained in this state for a long time. You spent the Chaturmas of 1665 in the city of Kharad. During this Chaturmas, non-Jain people also received immense religious benefit. After this, you spent the Chaturmas of 1666 in Faridkot and the Chaturmas of 1667 in Kasur, at the place of Lala Parmanand B.A., L.L.B.

When you were on your way to Ambala for the Chaturmas of Samvat 1668, a divine event occurred, which was filled with wonder. When you traveled from Rajpura to Ambala, you intended to stay at the Mughal Sarai. However, upon reaching there, you found that according to the rules of the Sadhus, water did not reach that place. Therefore, you settled down with your fellow monks under a very large tree near a bridge on the royal road, where water could reach. You kept your water vessels and other equipment there. You also spread out your clothes and other equipment that had become wet with sweat to dry. You thought that you would reach the Sarai in a few days. At that time, the Shravak Mandal of Ambala arrived to serve you. You told them about your intention to reach the Sarai, and they listened to the auspicious scriptures and left from there.

At that very moment, a man suddenly stood near Shri Maharaj and stared intently at the Sadhus' equipment. When Shri Maharaj asked him what he was looking at, he said, "These are all the Sadhus' equipment, which they always have to carry with them." Then, the following conversation took place between the man and Shri Ji:

Page #63:
---------------------------
11
Man - Who are you?
Shree Maharaj - We are Sadhus.
Man - What are these?
Shree Maharaj - These are the instruments, clothes, etc., for the Sadhus' religious practices.
Man - Please leave this place.
Shree Maharaj - Why?
Man - This tree is about to fall.
Shree Maharaj - There is no wind or anything like that visible at this time, so how can it fall?
Man - Sometimes they fall like that.

Hearing this, Shree Maharaj and the other Sadhus started to leave for another place, then the man said, "Take your instruments with you. Until you take everything, there is a possibility of it falling." Hearing this, the Sadhus peacefully picked up their instruments and took them to another place and sat down peacefully. Then that man became invisible. At that very moment, the largest branch of the tree, which was covering the entire bridge, suddenly fell and blocked the entire path of the bridge. The sound of its fall was so terrifying that even the devotees going towards the inn heard it and they again reached there to see Shree Maharaj. The devotees were very happy to find them safe and when they heard the above incident, their joy and amazement knew no bounds and they went back praising Shree Maharaj.

Similarly, many other amazing incidents have happened in your life. Once you were traveling from Nabha to Patiala, then you met a wild cheetah. Seeing it, you stood fearlessly. Looking at them, the cheetah peacefully went towards the forest. It was the effect of your peace and restraint and equal vision towards every creature that even a ferocious animal went away seeing you...

He became peaceful. It is universally acknowledged in the world that all other forces are insignificant in the face of spiritual strength. One who attains this strength cannot have an enemy in the first place, and even if there is one, he becomes peaceful, abandoning enmity. This is an incident from the Chaturmas in Ambala. Once, after the rains, in the middle of the day, you went outside the city to perform purisotsarga. When you were returning to the city after completing the ethical actions, you encountered a fierce serpent on the way, and it followed you. When you reached near the city and started to change your path, you said, "May no one kill this." As soon as these words came out of your mouth, the snake disappeared into a dense bush right before your eyes, and you entered the city with a peaceful mind.

A similar incident occurred in the city of Ferozepur. You were going out of the Upashraya to perform ethical actions as usual. On the way, you encountered a fierce black snake, which was probably two gaz long. It was also very thick in body. But its speed was so fast that even the birds nearby were screaming in fear. It came near you and, after looking at you properly, went straight ahead. Similarly, you encountered violent animals at other times as well, but due to the greatness of your ahimsa, they also showed kindness. In fact, violent animals do not attack anyone suddenly. They also recognize the feelings of humans. Those whom they find naturally non-violent, they themselves become non-violent when they see them. Therefore, ahimsa is a supreme virtue. Its greatness is also unparalleled.

You performed the Chaturmas of Samvat 1666 in the city of Ludhiana. This year also saw a great deal of propagation of dharma. The Chaturmas of 1670 was held in Faridkot. Many Jain and non-Jain individuals benefited greatly from it. The Chaturmas of 1671 was held in Kasur and that of 1672 in the Nabha state. This year, you were severely troubled by breathing difficulties. But even then, you did not deviate from your set path. You maintained unparalleled patience and peace.

In those days, Muni Shri Gyanchandraji Maharaj, after the Chaturmas, went from Nabha to the Barnala Mandi. There, he suffered from a chronic fever. Many suitable remedies

Page #65:
---------------------------

Even after the illness, it did not subside. Upon receiving this news, you traveled from Nabha and reached Barnala Mandi, where you paid your respects to the Muni. When the Muni attained heavenly abode, you accepted the request for Chaturmas in Ludhiana, as many brothers had requested. Accordingly, you performed Chaturmas in Ludhiana in 1673.
After Chaturmas, when you were ready to travel, the Shravak Mandal of Ludhiana requested you, "O Bhagwan! Your body has become very weak. You can't even walk with your own strength due to your breathing. It also seems inappropriate for you to travel from one village to another in a palanquin. Therefore, our humble request is that you grace us by staying permanently in this place. Just like Shri 1008 Acharya-Varya Motiramji Maharaj, you also have an unshakeable bond with this city. Therefore, you should definitely stay permanently here." Seeing the Shravaks' insistence, Shri Maharaj accepted their request and accordingly, remained in Ludhiana.
Since you established permanent residence in Ludhiana, many religious activities began there. You first organized the publication of scriptural books. A youth group was established here. Due to your permanent residence, many Shravaks, Shravikas, Sadhus, and Sadhvis started coming here.
In Samvat 1676, cataracts started forming in your eyes. Then, with the consent of Shriman Doctor Mathuradasji, a resident of Moga, you were placed in a palanquin of Sadhu-Vastra and taken to Moga Mandi. Doctor Sahib treated your eyes with great love, and the cataracts were removed. As a result, your vision was restored. After all this, you were again placed in a palanquin of Sadhu-Vastra and brought back to Ludhiana. Due to your residence in Ludhiana, happiness was visible on the face of every resident of the city.
Just as Jain people were devoted to your devotion, non-Jain people also considered their lives successful by serving you. Your love was equal for everyone. Therefore, everyone, regardless of their faith, looked at you with reverence and sought your darshan...

He considered himself fulfilled. It is the result of your truthful teachings and efforts that the institution named 'Jain Kanya Pathshala' in Ludhiana is running smoothly. Today, an estimated thousand girls are receiving education there. In this institution, girls are given religious education along with worldly education. This is the only Pathshala in the Jain community of Punjab, which is being run with good management and discipline.

Your words had such supernatural power that they attracted every individual. Your words were sweet, concise, and profound. You spent most of your time in silence. You often immersed yourself in self-reflection and experienced spiritual bliss.

The flow of time is so strange that it pays no attention to anyone. It has no regard for the righteous, the virtuous, the high or the low. Finally, it laid its cruel hand upon Swami Ji. On Friday, the 15th of Jyeshtha Krishna, 1688, you observed the fortnightly fast. Although you were often troubled by old age, on the day of breaking the fast, you experienced vomiting and purging, and you became very weak. Seeing this, in the evening, you told the Sadhus to make you observe a water fast. Accordingly, the Sadhus made you observe a water fast. At that time, you purified yourself through introspection and sincerely apologized to all beings. On Sunday, you observed a water fast without taking any medicine. After twelve o'clock, your condition became particularly worrisome. You gave up food at four o'clock in the evening. On Monday morning, when the doctors and physicians saw your condition as very critical, they made you observe a lifelong water fast. Around eight and a half o'clock, a smile suddenly appeared on your face. Your lips moved as if you were reciting something. On Monday, the second of Jyeshtha Shukla, 1688, your breath seemed to leave through your nose and eyes. In this peaceful and meditative posture, you left this mortal body and, assuming a luminous, ethereal body, were born in heaven.

Your departure caused great distress in the community. However, maintaining composure, the news of your passing was sent by telegram throughout Punjab.

Upon receiving this sorrowful news, nearly two thousand Shravaks from outside arrived in Ludhiana for your funeral rites. Your body was then bathed and adorned, and laid upon a very beautiful palanquin. All the people of Ludhiana city and the Shravaks from outside paid their last respects to you. The onlookers were amazed to see that even at this time, your brain was glowing with redness, and signs of brilliance were present on your entire face, there was not a single sign of death on it. In front of your palanquin, Bhajan Mandalis were singing hymns. Along with this, three bells were being rung. Eighty-one shawls were draped over your body. When the body reached the cremation ground, there were approximately more than 10,000 people with it. Your body was cremated with sixteen maunds of sandalwood wood. Nearly two maunds of apricots and other nuts were placed in the pyre. In this way, your final rites were performed with great ceremony. Many non-Jain people also participated in it. Then, on the third day, your ashes were brought from the cremation ground.
In the end, you attained death with the same emotions with which you had taken Diksha. With your death, the Punjab Shri Sangh lost a priceless gem. At the time of your death, you were 81 years and 6 months old. You spent 55 years, 5 months, and 12 days of your life in Sadhu-Vritti. Your disciple-group is still in an advanced state. Your disciple, Shri Shri Shri 1008 Ganavchhedak Jayramdas Ji Maharaj, is present. He, or his disciple-propagator, Shri Swami Shaligram Ji Maharaj, and other Sadhus, benefited greatly from your service. All these Munis comforted the hearts of the people who were distressed by your separation with true teachings.

My intention in giving this life-story here is only that people may learn from it and become eligible for a good destination. If even a few individuals have improved their lives from it, I will consider myself successful in this endeavor.

## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

This Sutra, with the phrase "I have heard" (Shrutam Maya), establishes that the words are not divine (Apourusheya) but rather human (Pourusheya).

Furthermore, this Sutra highlights the importance of Guru Bhakti (devotion to the teacher). Only a seeker who resides in a Guru-kula (teacher's institution) following the rules can truly hear (and gain true knowledge). Therefore, it is evident that every individual, even after attaining Abhinibodhik Jnana (intuitive knowledge), Shruta Jnana (scriptural knowledge), Avadhi Jnana (clairvoyance), Manah Paryav Jnana (knowledge of the mind), and the knowledge of the fourteen previous births, should not abandon Guru Bhakti. Just as Shri Sudharmacharaya, through devotion to the Lord, gained knowledge and, with humility, introduced Guru Bhakti and self-humility in the beginning of the Sutra with the phrase "Shrutam Maya." Consequently, this phrase is a testament to the human origin of words and the authenticity of scriptures.

**First Dasha**

The phrase "Shrutam Maya" also proves that "Dravya Shruta" (knowledge of substance) is useless due to its dependence on "Bhavana Kshepa" (mental impressions), while "Bhavana Shruta" (knowledge of experience) is useful. Because "Bhavana Shruta" involves the use of the auditory sense, and being characterized by specific features, the heard object is considered certain.

Now, the question arises: from whose mouth can the heard object be considered certain? The answer is: the heard word of an Aapta (reliable person) is certain. When the word of an Aapta is considered certain, the doubt naturally arises: who is an Aapta? The answer is: a person whose soul is free from attachment, aversion, etc., whose Jnana Avaraniya (veil of knowledge), Darshan Avaraniya (veil of perception), Mohaniya (delusive) and Antaraya (hindering) Karmas (actions) are destroyed, and whose soul has developed infinite knowledge, infinite perception, Kshayik Samyaktva (perfect knowledge), and infinite power. In essence, an Aapta is someone whose soul is omniscient and all-seeing.

1. Created by real speakers, not by God.
2. Written on books, etc., or read without application (knowledge of meaning, etc.).
3. Read with application.
4. Veiling knowledge.
5. Veiling self-perception.
6. Attracting to worldly objects.
7. Hindering self-elevation.

## First Chapter

**With Hindi Commentary**

Statements uttered by the **Āpta** (knowledgeable) are called **Āpta-vākyas** (authoritative statements). These statements have been compiled into **sūtras** (aphorisms) by the **Gaṇadharas** (chief disciples). Therefore, these sūtras are called **Āpta-praṇīta** (composed by the knowable). Statements uttered by those who have studied the **Daśa-pūrva** (ten previous) to **Caturdaśa-pūrva** (fourteen previous) are also **Āpta-vākyas**; because the **Gaṇadharas**' compilation of sūtras has not been declared doubtful by the **Tirthankara** (liberated soul), but rather **Ātmāgama** (self-revealed), **Anantarāgama** (immediately revealed), and **Paramparāgama** (tradition-revealed) - these three types of **lokoत्तर āgama** (superhuman revelation) have been established. The meaning of the **Tirthankara** is **Ātmāgama**, the meaning of the **Gaṇadharas** is **Anantarāgama**, and the sūtras are **Ātmāgama**. However, the sūtras of the disciples of the **Gaṇadharas** are **Anantarāgama**, and the meaning is **Paramparāgama**. Subsequently, both the sūtras and the meaning are **Paramparāgama**. From the above discussion, it is established that both the sūtras and the meaning are **Āpta-vākyas**, and **Āpta-vākyas** alone have the power to determine the nature of things.

Here, the question may arise: what is the proof that a certain person was or is **sarvajña** (omniscient)? The answer is that the certainty of a person's **sarvajñatā** can be determined from the statements they have made. If there is no contradiction in someone's statements, then it should be known that they are **sarvajña**. And if we find contradiction in someone's statements, then it must be accepted that the one who made those statements is **rāgī** (passionate), **dveṣī** (hateful), and **alpajña** (ignorant). Similarly, when the true nature of things is not described anywhere, it must be accepted that the one who made that statement is an **ayathārthajña** (unrealist) ordinary person.

**I**

In addition to this, we can also know someone's **sarvajñatā** through the **anumāna** (inference) proof. For example, in the inference "**parvato vanhimān dhūmatvāt**" (the mountain is fiery because of smoke), one person said "**parvato vanhimān**" (the mountain is fiery). Another person asked "**kasmāt**" (why do you know that?). The first person replied "**dhūmatvāt**" (because there is smoke). When someone sees smoke and infers the cause (mountain),

1. **Tirthankara**'s chief disciple.
2. Those who have studied the **Daśa-pūrva** (ten previous) knowledge.
3. Self-revealed proof.
4. **Anantarāgama** (immediately revealed) is the follower of **Ātmāgama**, the second revelation.
5. Tradition-revealed proof.
6. Proof.

Page #74:
---------------------------
##  Chapter 6: The Dasha-Shruta-Skandha Sutra

**The fire is proven by inference.**  If someone claims to have attained the knowledge of fire, it is certain that they have achieved this through the evidence of inference. For those who sit near the fire, it is directly perceived. Similarly, one should understand the nature of the omniscient.  

**Just as a substance that cannot be understood through 'mati-gyan', 'shruta-gyan', 'avadhi-gyan', and 'mana-paryavgyan' must be understood through a distinct knowledge, so too is the omniscient.** This unique knowledge, which directly perceives the substance, is called 'sarvagya' or 'sarvadarshi'.  Just as we understand the knowledge of a distant land through inference, so too should we understand the knowledge of the past.  For example, if Ramachandra is distant from us in time, he was directly perceived by his contemporaries.  Similarly, one should understand the nature of the omniscient.

**The above discussion clearly establishes the omniscient.**  The statements that are considered authoritative are called 'apta-vakya' or 'shastra'.

**The First Dasha**

The invocation "Ayushman Shiष्य!" in the sutra signifies that life is paramount in all endeavors. Only those who live long can attain Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha.  The invocation "He Ayushman Shiष्य!" is gentle and brings joy to the heart of the disciple.  Life is dear to all.  In the world, it is customary to bless people with long life.  This proves that the invocation "Ayushman" in the sutra is excellent and logical.

**When life is dear to all, the question arises: what are the different types of life?**  The answer is that life is of ten types:  Name, Establishment, Substance, Flow, Existence, Derived Existence, Enjoyment, Restraint, Fame, and Glory.  For example:

1. **Name-Life:**  Giving a name to living or non-living substances.
2. **Establishment-Life:**  The establishment of the nature of those substances.
3. **Substance-Life:**  The cause of the ability to live is called 'substance-life'.
4. **Flow-Life:**  The general form of life, like that of the inhabitants of hell, is called 'flow-life'.
5. **Existence-Life:**  The specific form of existence, like that of the inhabitants of hell.

**Om Om**

## First Dasha (Chapter)

**With Hindi Commentary**

**6. Tadbhava:**  Like humans, after death, humans are reborn. This is called Tadbhava life because of the similarity in species.

**7. Bhoga-Jivan:** The life of great beings like Chakravartis is Bhoga-Jivan (life of enjoyment).

**8. Samyama-Jivan:** The life of virtuous beings is Samyama-Jivan (life of self-control).

**9. Yasho-Jivan:** The life of fame and glory.

**10. Kirti-Jivan:** The life of renown and reputation. For example, the life of Shri Shraman Bhagwan Mahavir Swami.

The existence of all these ten types of lives is dependent on the life of Ayus (life span). In this chapter, the author refers to Samyama-Ayu (life of self-control) and Yasho-Kirti-rupa Ayu (life of fame and glory). However, even these Ayus are dependent on Karma.

This statement also teaches us that we should invite disciples with such gentle invitations, because auspicious invitations make the mind happy. Also, since Ayu is very dear, the listener's soul finds peace from this (blessing-like) invitation. Additionally, it proves that the teachings of the scriptures (Vidya-dan) given to a virtuous person can be completely successful. Just as rain can be beneficial only in a field, not on stones. And by saying "Ayushman", there is a clear indication of long life; because long life can make desires successful.

The meaning of the word "Tenam (Tena)" in the sutra is: The soul whose Mithyatva (false belief) rooted in the beginningless time has been destroyed, who has attained Keval Jnana (perfect knowledge) and Keval Darshan (perfect vision), and whose virtuous power is causing the rise of the Tirthankara lineage, making his Aapta (perfection) world-famous - that Shraman Bhagwan Mahavir has explained this way.

The word "Bhagavata" in the sutra refers to Bhagwan with complete wealth, the form of Ashtamahapraatihaarya (eight great miracles). He has described the nature of the principles with proper methods and detailed explanations.

The meaning of "Shrutam Maya" is that I have heard from the mouth of Bhagwan in the form of meaning, not in the form of sutras. Therefore, the sutras are authentic because they are the translation form of the meaning.

## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra, First Dasha

The phrase "Shrutam Maya Bhagavata Evam Akhyatam" (I have heard thus from the Bhagavan) completely refutes the possibility of a word being *apौरुषेय* (not originating from a human being). This is because the origin of words (vakyothpatti) is dependent on the organs of speech (kanthādi sthānāśrita) and these organs are dependent on the body (sthāna śarīrāśrita). Since God is bodiless (aśarīrī), the concept of a word being *apौरुषेय* is simply impossible. 

Therefore, we can conclude that scriptures are not *apौरुषेय*, but they are completely valid and authoritative because they are composed by the omniscient (sarvajña).

At this point, one might question whether scriptures are completely unreliable like the words of ordinary humans, since humans cannot be omniscient and therefore their writings cannot be authoritative. The answer lies in the fact that the soul (ātmā) can be omniscient, as we have already established. Therefore, scriptures spoken by the omniscient are completely authoritative.

Since *apौरुषेय* words are impossible and therefore unreliable, it is clarified that "I have heard from the mouth of God".

Because knowledge acquired with devotion (bhakti) is the only kind that can be truly successful, the *sutra* "Suyam Me Ausam Tenam Bhagavaya Evam Akhyam" describes God with all His attributes, influenced by devotion. For example, "Ausam Tenam" is an attribute of God, meaning "Ayushmatā Chirajīvinā" (by the long-lived, the immortal). This proves that a *nirāyu* (liberated soul, without a body) cannot speak.

If the text is read as "Ausam Tenam Shrutam Maya", it means "I have heard this while staying in a gurukul (school) with proper discipline".

Therefore, it is established that every seeker must acquire knowledge by staying in a gurukul with proper discipline and devotion to the guru. Only then can their knowledge be successful.

If "Ausam Tenam" is read as "Aamusam Tenam", it can be interpreted as "Āmṛśatā Bhagavatpādāravindaṁ Bhaktiḥ Karatalayugalādina Spṛśatā" (touching the lotus feet of God with devotion). This change teaches us that even after acquiring knowledge of all scriptures, one should never abandon devotion and reverence for the guru.

First Dasha
With Hindi Commentary.
6. If the Sanskrit translation of "Aausam Tenam" is "Aajushamanena" and the meaning is "by listening to the Guru with proper conduct and discipline while staying in his service", then it is proven that one should listen to the Guru (scripture) while staying in a suitable place and should never be overcome by laziness or sleep during the study of scripture.
_ The question may arise that how can "Me" which is the singular form of the fourth and fifth case of the "Asmat-Shabd" convey the meaning of the third case. The answer is that here "Me" is not the singular form of the fourth and fifth case but an inseparable particle and here it indicates the meaning of the singular form of the third case of the "Asmat-Shabd".
One should contemplate (the meaning of the word and sentence) according to one's own intellect in each Sutra-pad and sentence. In this Sutra, all three topics of "Aapt-Vakya", "Komal-Aamantaran" and "Apourushey-Vakya" are well described.
It is undeniably proven that until one studies scripture with devotion and humility, one can never attain supernatural bliss nor can one attain self-knowledge. Therefore, every seeker should study scripture with devotion and humility so that the student can quickly achieve the desired result. Along with this, one should also perform the tapasya (austerity) suitable for the study of scripture, so that one can also attain self-samadhi I during the time of study. Now, we describe in a smooth manner what was heard from the mouth of Shri Bhagwan:
Iha Khalu Therahin Bhagavantehin Biso Asamahi-Thana Panatta, Kayare Khalu Te Therahin Bhagavantehin Biso Asamahi-Thana Panatta, Ime Khalu Te Therahin Bhagavantehin Biso Asamahi-Thana Panatta. Tam Jaha
Iha Khalu Sthaviraibhagavadbhirvinshatirasamadhi-sthanaani prajnaptaani, kataraani khalu tani sthaviraibhagavadbhirvinshati-rasamadhi-sthanaani prajnaptaani. Tadyatha
Padarthanvaya-Iha-In this world, Khalu-Invariable particle in the sense of Vakyalankar, Therahin-Sthavir, Bhagavantehin-Bhagavants, Biso-Twenty, Asamahi-Asamadhi, Thana-Place, Panatta-Proclaimed.

Here are the 10 Dasha-Shruta-Skandha Sutras:

**First Dasha**

It has been done. The disciple asks - which, surely, they, the elders, the Bhagavants, twenty, of non-concentration, the place, the exposition have done. The teacher answers - these, surely, they, the elders, the Bhagavants, twenty, of non-concentration, the place, the exposition have done, as:

**Original Meaning:** In this world, the elder Bhagavants have expounded twenty places of non-concentration. The disciple asked - which elder Bhagavants have expounded twenty places of non-concentration? The teacher answered - these elder Bhagavants have expounded twenty places of non-concentration. Like:

**Commentary:** In this Sutra, the first point is shown that what subject is described in the first 'Dasha', the second is that how to make that subject clear. First of all, the teacher has described that in this world and Jain-Shasana, the elder Bhagavants have expounded twenty places of non-concentration. The disciple asked which twenty places of non-concentration have been expounded by the elder Bhagavants? The teacher answered that they are described further.

This style of exposition is very useful for the understanding of the inquisitive, because with this kind of interesting style, every inquisitive person gets the understanding of the subject quickly.

Now the question arises that what are the characteristics of 'Samadhi' and 'Asamadhi'? In answer, it is said - 'Samadhanam Samadhischetasaha Svasthyam Mokshamargea-vasthanamityarthaha'. The health-feeling of the mind and the attachment to the path of liberation is called Samadhi; that is, the one who does the work that brings peace to the mind and makes it move towards liberation, he (liberation) can achieve it, it is called Samadhi. The one who is opposite to this is called 'Asamadhi-Sthan'. The reasons due to which 'Asamadhi' arises are called 'Asamadhi-Sthan'.

Now the question arises that how many and which are the main divisions of Asamadhi? The answer is that although there are many divisions of 'Asamadhi', but the main divisions are considered to be two - 1- 'Dravya-Asamadhi' and 2- 'Bhav-Asamadhi'.

Page #79:
---------------------------
## First Dasha (with Hindi Commentary)

**1. 'Dravya-Asamadhi'** is said to be that which hinders the coming together of substances in a balanced way, preventing 'Samadhi' from arising. For example, if salt in vegetables or sugar in milk is excessive or deficient, it does not become palatable to the eater. Similarly, the lack of proper and balanced proportion of substances is the cause of 'Asamadhi'.

**2. 'Bhava-Asamadhi'** depends entirely on the emotions of the soul.

This Dasha only describes 'Bhava-Asamadhi'. Although sometimes 'Dravya-Asamadhi' can also be a cause of 'Bhava-Asamadhi'. 'Dravya-Asamadhi' is a secondary cause of 'Bhava-Asamadhi', while 'Bhava-Asamadhi' is the primary cause, which easily imprints itself on the hearts of people.

**Question:** Are there only twenty places of 'Asamadhi'? Can there not be more or less?

**Solution:** It is said that there can be more than twenty places, but here, **according to the 'Nayas'**, twenty places of 'Asamadhi' have been mentioned. All other distinctions fall under these. Any place similar to the one described here also falls under it. For example, 'quick movement' is a cause of 'Asamadhi', and similarly, 'quick speech', 'quick eating', etc., all 'quick actions' fall under it. All the places of 'Asanaya' are said to be causes of 'Asamadhi'. Similarly, sensory objects, 'Kashaya', sleep, 'Vikaththa' (egotism), etc., are also causes of 'Bhava-Asamadhi'. But all of these are included in the aforementioned places. In the same way, 'Shabala-Dosha' and 'Ashatana' etc., are all causes of 'Asamadhi'. But to prove their importance, these causes have been described in other 'Dashas'.

**Question:** When the Lord himself has mentioned twenty places of 'Asamadhi' in his principles, why is it said that the 'Sthavira Bhagavants' have propounded these twenty distinctions of 'Asamadhi'?

**Solution:** It is said that 'Sthavira Bhagavants' are usually 'Shruta-Kevalis'; this description has been given to prove their 'Swasadrishvaktṛutva' (ability to speak like themselves). To prove that 'Tattva-Vettha' (knowers of truth) 'Sthavira' are capable of creating 'Sutras' themselves, and to show the similarity of their true statements with their own statements, it has been said in this way. The essence is that even 'Shruta-Kevalis' are like 'Kevali Bhagavants' ...

Page #80:
---------------------------
## Chapter 12: The Dasha-Shruta-Skandha Sutra

This Sutra clearly states that while there are many causes of "Bhaava-Asamaadhi" (lack of concentration), the main causes are twenty. All other causes fall under these twenty.

The commentator writes in the commentary of the Sutra "Iha Khulu" etc.:

"Iha" refers to this world or to the teachings of the liberated ones. "Khulu" is used here for the sake of poetic embellishment and affirmation. Alternatively, the word "Khulu" can be understood as a qualifier, and it signifies that the liberated ones of the past, present, and future are being described.

The words "Thaana" and "Thaanaani" (meaning "places") are neuter gender, but they are in Prakrit, so they are not considered faulty.

Now, the author of the Sutra describes the twenty types of Asamaadhi in detail:

**1. Dav-Dav-Chaari Yavi Bhavai** - One who is extremely fast-moving. The word "Cha" indicates that this applies to other actions as well. The word "Avi" (also) indicates that this is in addition to the previous Asamaadhi.

**2. Apamjjiya-Chaari Yavi Bhavai** - One who is not properly cleansed. The words "Cha" and "Api" are to be understood as before.

**3. Dupamjjiya-Chaari Aavi Bhavai** - One who is poorly cleansed. The word "Cha" indicates that this applies to other actions as well. The word "Api" indicates that this is in addition to the previous Asamaadhis.

Page #81:
---------------------------
## First Dasha
**With Hindi Commentary**

**Original Meaning:**
1. To move quickly.
2. To move in an unswept place.
3. To move in a place that is difficult to sweep.

**Commentary:**
This sutra describes the three types of asamadhis related to "iryasamiti". For example, quick movement, etc., can lead to "atma-viradhana" and "samyama-viradhana" due to "sheeghra-kriyaas". For example, if a person is moving quickly without caution (because haste always leads to carelessness), it is very likely that they will fall into a pit or something similar, leading to "atma-viradhana". Secondly, quick movement will inevitably lead to the killing of insects and other living beings, resulting in "samyama-viradhana". This will lead to asamadhi in both worlds.

It is undeniable that "atma-samadhi" cannot be achieved if the physical state is not right. Therefore, protecting oneself is the only way to protect samyama. However, the killing of other living beings caused by the act of quick movement will lead to asamadhi in this world and the next. If a powerful creature is injured, it will retaliate against the person who caused the injury. Secondly, the consequence of that violence will inevitably lead to suffering in the afterlife. Therefore, it is undoubtedly proven that the act of quick movement leads to unfavorable results in both worlds.

Just like the act of quick movement, other similar actions like quick speech, quick eating, quick observation, quick spreading and contracting of limbs, and quick reading, etc., also lead to harmful consequences in both worlds.

The words "cha" and "api" in the sutra indicate other actions similar to "drutan drutan chaari" actions.

**1.**
Just as many unfavorable consequences have been described for quick movement, moving in an unswept place also leads to many faults. For example, many animals are born in unswept places. Walking in such a place (without sweeping) can lead to "atma-viradhana" and "samyama-viradhana". Because scorpions and other animals born in that place cannot remain calm when their limbs are touched, therefore...

Page #82:
---------------------------
## Chapter 14: Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

**First Dasha**

- **Self-violation** and **restraint-violation** are caused by [certain actions] and result in harm to both beings.
- Taking uncleaned bedding, spreaders, and other equipment, even if it is "just a little", is a major cause of **self-violation** and **restraint-violation**. Sitting, sleeping, and performing actions like defecation in an uncleaned place are not pleasant and lead to **non-samadhi**.
- Similarly, one should be aware of the issue of poorly cleaned places. Even if a place is not properly cleaned, the aforementioned faults can arise. Therefore, even while sleeping, one should clean the bedding with a dustpan before changing sides.
- When walking, only a well-cleaned place is a **samadhi-place**. Conversely, walking in an uncleaned or poorly cleaned place leads to **self-violation** and **restraint-violation**, resulting in a **non-samadhi-place**.
- One might ask why the **Eirya-Samiti** is taken first, leaving aside all other samitis. The answer is that walking is the first action. When this action achieves **samadhi**, the **samadhi** of all other samitis can be easily achieved. And walking can only be useful when the doer sees and knows all beings as self.
- This proves that **equanimity** is the main purpose of **samadhi**. Therefore, one should abandon **non-samadhi** and take refuge in **samadhi**.

Now, the sutra-kar describes the fourth **non-samadhi**:

**Atirikt-Sejjasanie. || 4 ||**
**Atirikt-Shayyanika. || 4 ||**

**Word-by-word meaning:**
- **Atirikt** - excessive,
- **Sejja** - dwelling-shelter,
- **Asanie** - seat-mat, etc.
- **Not having**.

**Meaning:**
- Having excessive bedding, mats, etc. (is a cause of **non-samadhi**).

Page #83:
---------------------------
## First Chapter
**With Hindi Commentary**

**Commentary:** This sutra clearly states that one should not possess more bedding, clothes, etc., than necessary. Because only things that are justified can be protected and purified according to the proper method, not those that are excessive. In things that cannot be properly cleaned and protected, many types of living beings are born. When insects and other animals are born in seats and other equipment, 'self-contradiction' and restraint contradiction will naturally arise, and their result will be harmful in both worlds. Not only that, but one will have to wander in the cycle of samsara due to lack of concentration.

**15**
Every individual should learn from this sutra that consuming things in a justified manner does not lead to lack of concentration. Just as eating food in a justified manner does not cause disease.

In this way, having described the 'committee of receiving, mere utensils, and equipment', the sutrakar now describes the subject of the 'committee of language'.

**Ratiniya-Paribhasi || 5 ||**
**Ratnik Paribhasi || 5 ||**

**Word Meaning:** Ratiniya - towards the Ratnakar, Paribhasi - to define.

**Main Meaning:** To speak in front of the guru and other elders.

**Commentary:** This sutra shows how one should behave with elders. The person who behaves politely with elders continues to attain the state of concentration. On the contrary, the Ratnik - Acharya, Upadhyaya, other elders, and those who are learned and initiated, who despise the elder monks, who learn from them and then try to defeat them, who use insulting words towards them, who make fun of their caste, etc., who argue about the sacred teachings received from them, and who are constantly engaged in their slander, are always subject to lack of concentration.

In addition to this, 'self-contradiction' and 'restraint contradiction' arise due to this, which results in harm in both worlds. Therefore, souls desiring concentration must pay attention to the 'committee of speech'.

Page #84:
---------------------------
##  Chapter 16: The Sutra of Ten Precepts

**First Precept**

Now the Sutra-maker describes the subject of violence against living beings:

**6. Theravaghaie** (One who harms the elders)

**6.  Sthaviropaghatika** (One who harms the elders)

**Word Meaning:** Theravaghaie - One who harms the elders.

**Original Meaning:** One who harms the elders.

**Commentary:** This Sutra explains that one who harms the elders can never attain the state of Samadhi (meditation). A person whose nature is to harm the elders, the Acharyas (teachers), and the Gurus (spiritual guides), through misconduct, moral failings, egotism, or false accusations, will undoubtedly attain Asamadhi (lack of meditation). This leads to self-contradiction and a violation of self-restraint.

If one worships the elders properly, then the soul can attain Samadhi. Therefore, it is proven that a being seeking Samadhi should not be a Sthaviropaghatika (one who harms the elders). If the elders use their spiritual power, then the harmful person will experience the cause of Asamadhi in this very life.

The conclusion is that respecting the elders is essential for attaining Samadhi, which will protect the state of Samadhi.

**7. Bhuovaghaie** (One who harms living beings)

**7. Bhutopaghatika** (One who harms living beings)

**Word Meaning:** Bhuovaghaie - One who harms living beings.

**Original Meaning:** One who harms beings with one sense organ or more.

Page #85:
---------------------------
## First Chapter
**With Hindi Commentary**

**Commentary:** This sutra clarifies that an individual engaged in violence, a violent being, one who is averse to the path of righteousness, and who does not even have a shred of compassion, is far from the path of self-absorption. Because without equanimity towards all beings, one cannot attain the state of absorption, and equanimity is impossible without compassion. Therefore, without compassion, attaining the state of absorption is not only difficult but impossible. It is proven that one whose soul is engaged in killing beings, including those with one sense, etc., attains the state of non-absorption, which naturally leads to self-contradiction and restraint-contradiction. The consequence of these is harmful in both worlds. Therefore, it is appropriate for an individual seeking self-absorption to protect every being, increase the states of absorption, and abandon the states of non-absorption, becoming immersed in their goal like sugar in milk. Only then can the soul attain transcendental bliss.

Now the sutra-author describes the afflictions that hinder absorption:

**Sanjalane || 8 ||**
**Sanjjanavah || 8 ||**

**Word Meaning:** Sanjalane - one who is constantly angry.

**Meaning:** One who is constantly angry.

**Commentary:** This sutra clarifies that the soul cannot attain self-absorption without the destruction of afflictions (the elimination of mental defilements like anger, etc.) and the cessation of their destruction. Where is absorption for a soul afflicted by anger, pride, deceit, and greed? Because its mind is always agitated. There is never peace in a restless mind. A soul contaminated by afflictions is unstable like a lamp in a storm and very far from right thought.

When afflictions arise, the soul cannot attain the state of absorption. Therefore, the sutra states that one who is constantly angry can never attain the state of absorption. Because whenever someone teaches them, they will become angry, so how can they attain the state of absorption? Therefore, it is proven...

**Jain**

Page #86:
---------------------------
## Chapter 4 of the 18 Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

**First Dasha**

- It is only possible for a peaceful soul, free from passions, to enter the path of Samadhi. Just as a tree can only grow with water, not fire.

**Kohane (6) - Krodhana (6)**

**Word Meaning:** Kohane - One who gets angry. 
**Original Meaning:** One who gets angry.

**Commentary:** The mind of an angry person is always a place of non-Samadhi. Because (Sakritkuddho'tyanta kuddho bhavati) if someone gets angry once for any reason, it becomes beyond their capacity to let go of that anger. In other words, an angry person can never grow the places of Samadhi, but only the places of non-Samadhi. Just as the moon can only increase cold and water, not fire, similarly, only a peaceful soul can increase the places of Samadhi, not an angry one.

It is proven that a person who desires self-Samadhi should not only embrace forgiveness but also achieve self-Samadhi by making peace their goal.

The Sutrakar has included all other obstacles to Samadhi in these two Sutras.

The meaning of the entire statement is that everyone should become established in Samadhi by abandoning the obstacles.

Now the Sutrakar describes the obstacle to Samadhi, "backbiting":

**Pitthi-Mansie (10) - Prushta-Mansika (10)**

**Word Meaning:** Pitthi-Mansie - One who speaks ill of others behind their back.
**Original Meaning:** One who backbites.

Page #87:
---------------------------
## First Dasha (with Hindi Commentary)

**Commentary:** This sutra describes that a person who is a pishun (one who backbites) can never attain samadhi. This is because a backbiter destroys their own virtues and covers up the virtues of others. Since their inner self is not pure, a backbiter cannot attain samadhi. Additionally, all other faults of backbiting are well-known in the world, therefore one should not backbite.

**16**

The "prishtha-masika" individual mentioned in the sutra is also considered shameful to be equal with noble people. "Prishtha-masika" (one who eats the flesh of the back) means (parangmukhasya parasya avarnavadkari) one who uses derogatory words for an absent person. It is also inappropriate to be associated with backbiting. Therefore, one who desires samadhi should completely abandon it and attain the state of samadhi.

In some books ("pitthi-mansie yavi bhavahi" - prishtha-masika chapi bhavati), there is a variation in the text. In this text, the words "cha" and "api" refer to all kinds of gossip and backbiting words, as they are all obstacles to samadhi. Therefore, it is appropriate for every seeker of samadhi to increase their samadhi by abandoning vices like backbiting.

There may be a doubt here: what is wrong with revealing the faults of a person who actually has them? The answer is that it is appropriate to teach such a person to abandon their faults with a sense of goodwill, not to reveal their faults to the public with a sense of hatred and increase their hatred. Those who seek samadhi should also stay away from backbiting and other vices because their duty is to enter their own nature by observing silence and to preach the truth. Additionally, it is not their duty to backbite others or describe their faults.

The sutrakar has described this asamadhi because it easily leads to self-condemnation and restraint-condemnation, which results in suffering in both worlds.

Therefore, one should abandon backbiting and only observe their own faults (and try to abandon them). By revealing their own faults to the public, the soul can attain samadhi. This is because by doing so, the soul's kshaya, etc., faults will be pacified.

Page #88:
---------------------------
##  The Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra, First Dasha, Sutra 11

**Verse 20**

He will become fit for self-purification. Self-absorption is also done to remove faults, therefore everyone should try to remove their faults.

The next Sutra describes how calling an uncertain meaning certain is also a state of non-absorption.

**Sutra 11**

**AbhikKhanam 2 OharaItta Bhavai || 11 ||**

**AbhikKhanam AbhikKhanam Avadharayita Bhavati || 11 ||**

**Word-by-word meaning:**

* AbhikKhanam 2 - repeatedly,
* OharaItta - one who speaks in a definitive language,
* Bhavai - is.

**Meaning:**

One who speaks in a definitive language about matters of doubt.

**Commentary:**

The meaning of the Sutra is that one should not use definitive language for matters that are still doubtful. Because if the speaker themselves do not know the truth of a matter and they present it as certain to the public, then when doubt arises, they will inevitably face self-contradiction and violation of restraint.

This proves that speaking definitively about doubtful matters is a cause of non-absorption. Therefore, it is appropriate and faultless to repeatedly refrain from calling an uncertain meaning certain and to avoid using language that covers up the qualities of others. Just as calling a non-slave (Adas) a slave and calling a non-thief (Achor) a thief creates unrest in the soul, similarly, false speech also disturbs the soul and leads to the state of non-absorption. Therefore, one should not speak definitively about anything that is doubtful, whether it be substance, space, time, or emotion, because doing so is an obstacle to self-absorption. Those who desire absorption should be absorbed in self-absorption by abandoning these obstacles.

Here the question may arise: what is self-absorption, about which so many obstacles are being described? The answer is that when...

Page #89:
---------------------------
## First Stage

**With Hindi Commentary**

**The soul's true nature is revealed and the distinction between the meditator and the object of meditation disappears, leaving only the form of the object of meditation. This is called self-absorption.**

**However, this self-absorption can only be attained by abandoning afflictions. Therefore, the next sutra discusses the inattention caused by afflictions:**

**"Navaanam adhikaranaanam anuppannaanam uppatta bhavai." (12)**

**"Navaanaam adhikaranaanaam anutpannaanaam utpaadita bhavathi." (12)**

**Word-by-word meaning:**

* **Navaanam:** New
* **Adhikaranaanam:** Of the grounds
* **Anuppannaanam:** Not yet arisen
* **Uppatta:** Causing to arise
* **Bhavai:** Is

**Meaning:**

* **Causing new grounds of conflict to arise.**

**Commentary:**

* **The sutra implies that conflicts are obstacles to absorption.** Creating conflicts that do not yet exist, for any reason, leads to inattention. This is because afflictions naturally lead to self-contradiction and restraint-contradiction. Therefore, it is proven that conflicts are the main obstacles to absorption. They are not only obstacles to absorption but also the root of many evils.

* **The commentator explains the word "adhikarana" in the sutra as follows:** "Adhikaranaanaam - kalhaanaam, yantraanaam, jyotishanimittaanaam va." This means creating conflicts using machines or by targeting a specific event through astrology. Because any weapons created will be violent and will inevitably lead to inattention.

* **The word "nutan" in the sutra refers to creating conflicts by presenting a reason to disrupt the peace and harmony of people who live peacefully and without contradiction. This causes inattention in all beings.** Such actions cause the soul to fall from the state of absorption into inattention. Therefore, it is appropriate for aspiring souls to completely avoid new conflicts.

**Now the question arises: If new grounds are mentioned here, then there must be old grounds as well.**

**The sutra-maker himself answers this:**

Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
First Dasha
The one who stirs up old disputes that have been forgiven and settled becomes a cause of unrest. || 13 ||
Meaning of the words:  Poraanaanam - old, Adhikaranaanam - disputes (that), Khamiy - forgiven, Viuusaviaanam - settled (those that), Punoodiritta - one who stirs up again, Bhavai - is.
Meaning: The one who stirs up old disputes that have been forgiven and settled.
Commentary: This sutra states that stirring up old disputes that have been settled through forgiveness is a major cause of unrest. This is because doing so can lead to many individuals abandoning their good deeds and engaging in evil deeds. It also naturally leads to the destruction of the self and restraint. The word Adhikarana means "that which lowers the good outcomes of the self, or it means strife." That which lowers the good qualities of the self and causes unrest is called Adhikarana. Due to strife or Adhikarana, the self enters into unrest. This leads to the destruction of penance, the loss of fame, the destruction of the three jewels of knowledge, etc., and an increase in mutual hatred in the world.
It is proven that to protect the state of Samadhi, one should not remember old disputes. Every individual should learn from this that when peace is present, it is appropriate to not remember old disputes. This is because there is a fear of increasing unrest. Therefore, a person who desires Samadhi should achieve Samadhi by remaining separate from strife, etc., so that their self can be blessed.
In the next sutra, the sutrakar describes that every individual should abandon strife, etc., and engage only in self-study. However, self-study at an inappropriate time is also a cause of unrest.

## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## First Dasha

This Sutra describes how to protect the earth-bodied beings:

**"Sasarakh-paani-paaye" (15) "Sarajask-paani-paada" (15)**

**Word-by-word meaning:**  Sasarakh - filled with sentient dust, paani-paaye - those with hands and feet.

**Meaning:** If a householder's hands and feet are covered in sentient dust, one should not accept alms from them.

**Commentary:** This Sutra shows how to protect earth-bodied beings. A monk should not accept alms from a householder whose hands and feet are covered in sentient dust. Accepting alms in such a situation would be a violation of earth-bodied beings, which would lead to a violation of the self and restraint. Additionally, when a monk returns after excreting, they should wash their hands and feet before sitting on an asana. Failure to do so would be a violation of earth-bodied beings, as their feet would inevitably be covered in sentient dust before washing. The implication is that one should strive to be careful in this way.

The question arises as to why such actions lead to non-concentration. The answer is that violence against living beings results in non-concentration. However, the mention of "Mrittika" (earth) here is indicative of the protection of all six-bodied beings. The scriptures prescribe the protection of the following six-bodied beings:

1. Earth-bodied
2. Water-bodied
3. Fire-bodied
4. Air-bodied
5. Plant-bodied
6. Animal-bodied

Since a non-violent soul is worthy of the state of concentration, every individual seeking concentration should completely avoid violence.

Next, the Sutra-maker describes how a concentrated soul should speak during the night and day, and how speaking in a certain way can lead to non-concentration.

## First Stage

**Obtaining the First Stage:**

**Sad-kare.** || 16 ||

**Hindi Commentary Included:**

**Word:** Kare. || 16 ||

**Word Meaning:** Sad-kare - To speak more than the measure in the night and day.

**Main Meaning:**

- One who speaks more than the measure.

**Commentary:**

This sutra describes that a person in samadhi should first know the substance, field, time, and emotion before speaking, because speaking at the wrong time will inevitably lead to asamadhi. Therefore, knowledge of time is essential for speaking. Speaking loudly in a quiet dwelling at night is inappropriate, as it can cause asamadhi in many people. Speaking loudly after one prahar of the night will cause distress to people. This time is usually for people to sleep. Similarly, one should also know about the middle of the night, the western part of the night, and the day in the same way. For example, if one has to stay in a place where the ruler is sick, but due to some medical treatment, he falls asleep during the day; the doctors forbid talking loudly, now if a sadhu starts speaking loudly there, he will surely obtain the asamadhi-sthana. Similarly, speaking at the wrong time in samadhi-sthana, dhyana-sthana, and dharma-upadesha-sthana can also lead to self-contradiction and restraint-contradiction.

**25**

A person seeking samadhi should not use vulgar and rude language like householders.

It is proven that knowledge of words is necessary first. After that, knowledge of the right time for using words is also very necessary, so that asamadhi does not arise.

Now the sutrakar says in the next sutra that one should not use words that destroy samya-bhava.

Page #94:
---------------------------
## 26
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Jhanjha-kare || 17 ||
## Jhanjha-karah || 17 ||
## Padaarthanvaya - Jhanjha-kare - One who uses words that cause division. 
## Moolarth - 1 - One who uses words that cause division and discord among others.
## Teeka - Using words that create division among the community and cause distress in their minds leads to asamadhi (lack of concentration). The reason is clear - when division arises in the community, samadhi (concentration) will be broken, inevitably leading to asamadhi. This will result in self-destruction and violation of restraint.
## Pratham Dasha
## When a person experiences sorrow, their mind usually does not experience any other emotions besides regret and anger. These two emotions are capable of completely destroying samadhi. Therefore, it is proven that one should not use words that create division. Those who desire self-samadhi should completely avoid such actions.
## The word "Jhanjha" is also used to describe engaging in rude and contentious arguments. Those who desire samadhi should never engage in such arguments.
## The essence is that one should never use words that create division, as it inevitably leads to asamadhi.
## Now the sutrakar describes the subject of conflict:
## Kalhai-kare || 18 ||
## Kalha-karah || 18 ||
## Padaarthanvaya - Kalha-kare - One who engages in conflict. 
## Moolarth - One who causes distress.

Page #95:
---------------------------
## First Chapter
**With Hindi Commentary**

**Commentary:** This sutra highlights that engaging in conflict destroys the state of samadhi and increases the state of asamadhi. The use of words that provoke conflict naturally leads to conflict. Just as digging in the earth (mittika) naturally creates a pit, it inevitably leads to self-condemnation and restraint-condemnation. Conflict brings bad results in both worlds, therefore it is an obstacle to samadhi.

A person seeking samadhi should never use words that provoke conflict, but instead should focus on ways to pacify conflict.

Conflict is completely to be abandoned as it is a cause of asamadhi. Just as the sun shines brightly when the clouds disappear, similarly, the qualities of the soul are revealed when conflict is eliminated.

Now the sutrakar speaks about food: **Sūrappamāṇa-bhoī || 16 ||**  **Sūra-pramaṇa-bhojī || 16 ||**

**Word Analysis:** **Sūra-ppamāṇa-bhoī** - one who eats according to the sun's measure. **Mūlārtha:** One who eats according to the sun's measure.

**Commentary:** This sutra describes that only one who eats with measure can attain the state of samadhi, not one who eats without measure. Because, for one who is only focused on eating from sunrise to sunset, where is the time for samadhi? If someone teaches him (the one who eats without measure) to eat with measure or opposes his excessive eating, he will surely engage in conflict with him (the teacher) and start accusing him of false faults. In such a state, how can he attain the state of samadhi? It is impossible.

Many ailments like indigestion (visūchika) also arise from eating beyond measure. It increases sleep, laziness, and disease, which naturally leads to a lack of self-study. Therefore, it is appropriate to eat with measure and at the same time. Also, one should not eat those foods that have the potential to cause asamadhi.

Page #96:
---------------------------
## Chapter 28

**Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra**

In addition to this, the time of eating should also be fixed. Only by fixing the time and quantity of food can one attain the state of Samadhi.

**First Dasha**

**Esana Asamite Avi Bhavai || 20 ||**
**Eshana Asamita Chapi Bhavati || 20 ||**

**Word by Word Meaning:**
* Esana Asamite - Eshana - against the rule, Avi Bhavai - which happens (moves)

**Meaning:**
* One who moves against the rule of Eshana.

**Commentary:**
* The meaning of Eshana-Samiti is that all the substances that are fit for a Sadhu to consume should be purified by investigation or Eshana before being consumed. One should never consume unacceptable substances. Without the knowledge of the use of Eshana-Samiti, one who consumes substances without thought increases the states of Asamadhi. And by not paying full attention to Eshana-Samiti, there is also a decrease in the feelings of compassion (mercy), because
* One who goes for alms without any Sadhu-thought (i.e., only with the thought of food) has only the feeling of receiving, he does not see whether a particular thing is defective or flawless, whether it has been produced by violence or non-violence. By consuming substances without Eshana, the feeling of compassion for the six types of beings is lost.
* If a Sadhu stops him (one who consumes substances without Eshana) from consuming substances without Eshana and he quarrels with him, then there will surely be self-reproach and restraint-reproach.
* The conclusion is that a person who desires Samadhi should not consume any substance without Eshana.

So far, only the obstacles to Samadhi have been described. The states of Samadhi will be described later.

The twentieth Samavay of the 'Samavayanga' Sutra also describes twenty states of Asamadhi, but it should be noted that there is a difference between the states of Asamadhi described in this chapter and the aforementioned twentieth Samavay. For example, in the "Samavayanga Sutra", "Sanjalanee || 8 || Ko || 6 ||" these two, the 8th and the 6th, two states are described, but...

Page #97:
---------------------------
## First Dasha (Chapter)

**With Hindi Commentary**

In the "Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra", both these places are referred to as "Sanjalane, Kohane" (8). They are considered the same place. In the "Samavayanga Sutra", "Pitthi-Mansie" is mentioned as the tenth place, but in the "Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra", it is mentioned as the sixth place, "Pitthi-Mansie Yavi Bhavai". In the "Samavayanga Sutra", "Sasarakkha-Paani-Pae" is the sixteenth place, but in the "Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra", "Akale Sajjhaakari-Yavi Bhavai" is mentioned before this place, and "Sasarakkha-Paani-Pae" is written after it. In the "Samavayanga Sutra", "Akala-Sajjhay-Karae Yavi Bhavai" is mentioned as the sixteenth place. In the "Samavayanga Sutra", "Kalahakare" is the sixteenth place, and in the "Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra", it is the seventeenth place. In the "Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra", "Asamahi-Karae" (Asamadhi-Karaka) is mentioned to compensate for the lack of previous numbers. Also, in some copies of the "Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra", "Bheyakare" is found in place of "Asamahi-Karae", but this only changes the word, not the meaning. Therefore, it is appropriate for wise individuals to remember these numbers carefully and eliminate the Asamadhi-sthana (places of non-meditation) to attain Samadhi-sthana (places of meditation). This will purify the soul and lead it to Nirvana.

Samadhi is the path to liberation, not Asamadhi. Therefore, those who desire liberation should attain Samadhi.

Now, the author of the Sutra concludes the study by writing:

"Ete Khalu Te Therehi Bhagawantahi Biso Asamahi-Thana Panna-Tti Bemi" (21).

"Iti Padhama Dasha Samatta" (21).

"Etani Khalu Tani Staviraibhagavadabhirvinshatyasamadhisthanani Prajnaptaani" iti Bravimi (21).

"Iti Prathama Dasha Samaapta" (21).

**Word-by-Word Meaning:**

Ete - These, Khalu - Certainly, Te - Those, Therehi - By the elders, Bhagawantahi - By the Bhagavans, Biso - Twenty, Asamahi - Asamadhi, Thana - Places, Panna - Mentioned, Tti - Thus, Bemi - I say.

Iti - Thus, Padhama - First, Dasha - Chapter, Samatta - Completed.

Page #98:
---------------------------
## 30
## Dashaśruta Skandha Sutra
## Original Meaning - It is certain that the venerable Bhagavants have expounded twenty places of asamadhi.
## First Dasha
## Commentary - Concluding the study presented in this Sutra, the Sutrakar says that the venerable Bhagavants, as mentioned earlier, have expounded these twenty places of asamadhi. The main purpose of this statement is that all other distinctions fall under these twenty.
## For example, the Sutrakar has described "kalha-kara" as a place of asamadhi. All other causes of kalha fall under this. Just as there are many types of colors, but they all fall under the five primary colors, similarly, the many causes of kalha are included in one single category.
## It is beneficial for those who are seeking to abandon asamadhi and attain samadhi-sth.
## There may be a doubt that why the description of asamadhi places is given first in this study, without mentioning samadhi places? In response, it is said that both samadhi and asamadhi places are described in this study for the attainment of bhavasamadhi. The Sutrakar has stated that there are twenty places of asamadhi. The word asamadhi here is a compound word ending in "nan tatpurusha". If the "nan" compound is not used, then these twenty become samadhi places, meaning that by removing the "a" these twenty become places of bhavasamadhi. Just as the word "jnanavaraneya" becomes "jnan" after removing the "avaran", similarly, by removing the "a" it becomes "samadhi-sthana". Therefore, it is proven that through this study, the seeker can understand the nature of samadhi and asamadhi well.

Now Sudharmacharaya Jambuswami says to Jambuswami - O Jambuswami! I have expounded this study in the same way as I heard it from the lotus mouth of Sri Bhagavan. I have not said anything from my own intellect.

Page #99:
---------------------------
## The Second Stage

The first stage described the states of *asamadhi*.  The practice of *asamadhi* states leads to the acquisition of *shabala* defects. Therefore, in this stage, in relation to the first stage, the author describes the *shabala* defects in detail.

Now the question arises, what is *shabala* (defect)? The answer is that *shabala* is of two types: "dravya-shabala" and "bhava-shabala".  *Dravya-shabala*, as the *koshakara* say, "shabalam karburam chitram" - refers to the variegated (multicolored) color of animals like cows. *Bhava-shabala* is the name of the defect that affects the mind when it is grasped; that is, to deviate from one's own rules is called *bhava-shabala*. However, *bhava-shabala* only extends to *atikram*, *vyatikram*, and *atichaar*.

For example, if a person invites a sage to their home for a meal, accepting the invitation is the *atikram* defect, presenting oneself for the meal is *vyatikram*, taking the meal in a vessel is the *atichaar* defect, and consuming the meal becomes the *anaachar* defect.

The breaking of the first three of the fundamental qualities is *shabala* defect-inducing (causing defect), and the breaking of the fourth is called *sarva-bhang* (complete breaking). It is also said, "Mula gunesh-adim eshu bhang eshu shabalo bhavati chaturthe bhang e sarva-bhang".

Before describing the *shabala* defects in detail, it is necessary to explain that just as a stain on a white cloth is removed by appropriate substances like alkali, similarly...

## Chapter 32: The Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

**32**
**The Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra**

Any blemishes that have been indulged in should be removed by the corresponding atonement. However, even the slightest blemish should not be allowed to remain; because just as a small hole in a pot allows all the water to leak out, so too, a small remaining blemish in the pot-like being is sufficient to drain out the water of restraint. Therefore, one should strive with a determined mind to remove blemishes as much as possible, so that there is not even an atom of blemish in the character-dharma.

**1**
**The Second Stage**

Just as a potter creates a pot with precise actions like rotating the wheel, so too, one should protect restraint with precise actions, but not allow blemishes to arise. Like a white cloth painted with many spots, one should not allow the cloth of restraint to be painted with blemishes. In other words, one should always strive for the purity of restraint.

Because lack of concentration causes all the states of the soul to lean towards unrestraint, this stage has been created with the main objective of generating concentration.

Although "blemish" is a single word, according to the practical perspective, the scripture writer has fixed the number of blemishes based on the pure thought of the inquisitive, special knowledge, and the welfare-wisdom of the people.

The scripture writer himself describes it:

"I have heard, O venerable one, thus has the Blessed One spoken: Here, indeed, twenty-one blemishes have been declared by the venerable ones, which are those twenty-one blemishes declared by the venerable ones? These, indeed, are the twenty-one blemishes declared by the venerable ones, namely:..."

## The Second Chapter

**With Hindi Commentary**

**Word-by-Word Meaning:**

Ausam, he Ayushman, disciple, me - I have heard, tena - by him, Bhagavaya - the Bhagavan, evam - thus, akkhayan - declared, ih - in this Jain - religion and world, khalu - certainly, therehi - by the elders, Bhagavantehi - by the Bhagavans, ekavisa - twenty-one, sabala - strong, dosha - faults, pannanatta - declared. The disciple asked, kayare - which, khalu - certainly, therehi - by the elders, Bhagavantehi - by the Bhagavans, te - those, ekavisa - twenty-one, sabala - strong, dosha - faults, pannanatta - declared? The Guru answers. Ime - these, khalu - certainly, te - those, ekavisa - twenty-one, sabala - strong, dosha - faults, therehi - by the elders, Bhagavantehi - by the Bhagavans, pannanatta - declared, tam jaha - as:

**Main Meaning:**

O Ayushman disciple! I have heard that the Bhagavan has declared thus, in this Jain religion, the elder Bhagavans have declared twenty-one strong faults. The disciple asked which twenty-one strong faults have the elder Bhagavans declared? The Guru answered that the elder Bhagavans have declared the following twenty-one strong faults, as:

**Commentary:**

In this sutra, like the first chapter, the subject of this chapter - the description of strong faults - is described in the form of a question and answer between the Guru and the disciple. It also clarifies that the words of the Bhagavan are worthy of acceptance (grahṇ karne yogya) for all beings, because the Bhagavan is the well-wisher of all beings, therefore his words are also beneficial for beings.

The statement in the sutra, "The elder Bhagavans have declared twenty-one types of strong faults," is for the confirmation of the meaning of the sutra "Ajina jisa ka sa jina iv avitah - vageramana"; that is, the elder Bhagavans are not Jinas, but they are like Jinas and are also truthful speakers like Jinas. Therefore, even though the subject is declared by the elders, it should be understood as declared by the Jinas. This is beneficial for both worlds, therefore all beings should accept it and learn it with humility because it is the word of the Bhagavan.

The question may arise that what is the proof that the Bhagavan himself has declared this subject? It is possible that someone else created it and attributed it to the Bhagavan.

Page #102:
---------------------------
Dasha-shruta-skandha-sutra
Second Dasha
It is said in the solution that the divine speech of the Bhagavan has supernatural power, which is rational and comprehensible, and is also beneficial for both the worlds. All these qualities are found in the present Dasha, so there is no doubt that this statement is of the Bhagavan himself. Those who wish for their own welfare should study it with reverence and faith.

Now the sutra-maker, while describing the present subject, first describes the subject of the first Shabala defect:

1. Hattham-kammam karemaane sabale.
Meaning of the words: Hattham-kammam - hand-work, karemaane - while doing, sabale - with the Shabala defect.
Meaning - Doing hand-work with the Shabala defect.

Commentary - This sutra highlights the fact that there are such ignorant people in the world who commit many such misdeeds, which easily lead to self-harm and violation of restraint.

There are two such vile deeds in the world, the full fruit of which cannot be borne even in this entire life, so their consequence has to be suffered in the next world as well. The deeds whose impact makes the human birth itself futile, and the soul has to suffer a wretched state instead of a happy one, i.e. its entire life becomes full of sorrow. This sutra describes some such deeds. For example, due to the rise of the Mohaniya karma, if a living being becomes subject to the Veda-vikara, then under its influence, if a man emits semen through hand-action or a woman performs some improper act with a piece of wood etc., then they will surely become weak, sickly and diseased. It is also written:

Kampah, svedah, shramah, murchha, bhrama-glanir-bala-kshayal.
Rajayakshma-adi-rogash-cha bhaveyu-maithunotthatah.

Page #103:
---------------------------
Second Stage
With Hindi Bhasha Tika (Commentary).

The diseases are caused by the effect of this karma (action). And the diminution of memory power, lack of intelligence, absence of luster on the head, excessive restlessness of the mind, not having firm belief in any object, feeling shy in assemblies, etc., loss of luster of the eyes, becoming easily heated, lack of patience, increase in laziness, delusion in the mind, loss of strength, impotence, emission of semen in dreams and falling of semen along with urine - all these disorders are produced only by masturbation.

Not only that the one who indulges in masturbation becomes short-lived, but also this evil deed itself. There is no virtuous act in the world which is not destroyed by masturbation, nor is there any disease which does not attack the one who indulges in masturbation; because due to repeated colds, the hollowness of the brain, due to the weakening of the digestive fire, the lack of appetite, and due to the lack of sufficient blood, the increase of phlegm, etc. constantly occur. And due to constant constipation, the body becomes like earth. In addition to this, all the disorders mentioned in the sutra "Jaramaranaragasokabahullyam" constantly pursue him. That is, from the act of coitus, the destruction of physical luster, premature death, diseases (physical diseases) and sorrow (mental worry) keep increasing. Therefore, one should not destroy the pure semen through the hand out of foolishness; because the existence of life depends on its protection.

The one who indulges in masturbation makes his pure conduct stained (spotted) and by making the body a house of diseases, strikes an axe on his own life with his own hands. Therefore, one should never do such deeds, nor should one encourage others to do so, nor should one encourage those who do it.

Now the author describes the subject of the next stain:

Mehuna padi sevamane sabale. 2.
Maithuna prati sevamana sabala.2.
Meaning of the words - Mehuna - Maithuna (sexual intercourse), padi sevamane - while indulging in, sabale - becomes stained (spotted).

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

Dashaśrutaskandhasūtra
Second Dasha
Mūlārtha - Engaging in sexual intercourse leads to the arising of Śabala doṣa (impure karmic stain).
Ṭīkā - In the previous chapter, the description of manual masturbation was given. In this sūtra, the description of the Śabala doṣa arising from sexual intercourse is provided.
The person who is constantly attached to sensual pleasures also develops all the aforementioned diseases. The destruction of the atoms of semen through thoughts of sexual intercourse weakens the soul. Similarly, by constantly remaining engrossed in sensual desires, all the powers of the mind wither away and gradually become dull. Therefore, one should not even think about sexual intercourse.
Just as it was previously stated that Śabala doṣa is considered only up to Atikrama, Vyatikrama, and Atichāra, similarly here also, the Maithunadevamānuṣatairyagyoni-sambandhi-Atikrama, Vyatikrama, and Atichāra, when engaged in, becomes the cause of Śabala doṣa. However, if sexual intercourse is engaged in through misconduct, it completely breaks the vow. Explaining this, the commentator writes: "Thus, sexual intercourse engaged in through the Atikrama, Vyatikrama, and Atichāra of the divine, human, and animal wombs is Śabala, but if engaged in through misconduct, it is a complete breach (of the vow)."
While explaining the Śabala doṣas in the 21st Samavāya of the Samavāyāṅga Sūtra, the commentator writes: "The one who engages in sexual intercourse is Śabala due to the three types: Atikrama, Vyatikrama, and Atichāra." 
This means that sexual intercourse performed through Atikrama, Vyatikrama, and Atichāra is Śabala doṣa-laden, and if engaged in through misconduct, it is called a complete breach of the vow, because when sexual intercourse is performed through the body itself, the breach of the vow is undisputed.
In addition to this, the self-violation and violation of restraint (saṃyama) due to sexual intercourse is evident, because madness or consumption (rājayakṣmā) etc. arise, leading to self-violation, and the destruction of countless microscopic living beings in the female womb leads to the violation of restraint. The most excellent nine lakh living beings are born in the womb, and their violation certainly occurs through male companionship. Therefore, it is established that this karma is to be completely abandoned.

## Second Chapter
## With Hindi Commentary

Now the Sutrakar describes the third Shabala:

**Rai - Bhoananam Bhumjamane Shabale || 3 ||**

There are individuals in the world who are constantly immersed in worldly desires, making their pure life tainted with Shabala-dosha. However, a person with good intentions should never do such a thing.

**37**
**Ratri Bhojanam Bhumjanah Shabala || 3 ||**

**Word by word meaning:** Rai - Bhoananam - Ratri mein bhojan bhumjamane - Bhogate hue Shabale - Shabala dosha lagta hai.

**Meaning:** Eating at night leads to Shabala dosha.

**Commentary:** This Sutra discusses the consumption of food at night for the sake of preserving life. For example, "Bhujyate iti bhojanam ratrau bhojanam ratri - bhojanam". Consuming food like grains at night is called "Ratri - Bhojan". The four parts of food like grains are described as follows: 1 - From the substance - grains, etc., 2 - From the field - time field evidence, 3 - From time - (a) Food consumed during the day is eaten during the day (b) Food consumed during the day is eaten at night (c) Food consumed at night is eaten during the day (d) Food consumed at night is eaten at night, 4 - From emotion - If food like grains is being consumed with attachment and aversion, then also Shabala dosha is obtained. It should be kept in mind that out of the four divisions of time, the first division is pure, the remaining three are impure.

Eating food in a proper way does not lead to Shabala dosha. This Sutra states that eating at night is tainted with Shabala-dosha.

Now the question arises, what is the harm in eating at night? The Guru answers that eating at night, firstly, does not allow for the complete observance of the Ahimsa Vrat, because subtle beings can be seen with the naked eye during the day in a way that they cannot be seen at night. Therefore, it is proven that one should not eat at night for the sake of protecting life. Secondly, at night, living and non-living things like thorns are not clearly visible, and it is very possible for them to enter food, leading to various types of...

Page #106:
---------------------------
##  Chapter 38: The Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

**Why one should not eat at night:**

* **Disease:** Eating at night can lead to the development of diseases, therefore, it should be avoided for self-protection.
* **Disruption of Samadhi:** Eating at night disrupts the Samadhi of the Sadhus, therefore, it should be completely avoided.
* **Hindrance to Tapas:**  Abstaining from food at night allows for the natural completion of Tapas, as the remaining half of one's lifespan will be dedicated to it.

**For Jain monks, this rule is paramount:**

* It is included in the fundamental principles, as it is taught after the five great vows.

**Consequences of eating at night:**

* It violates the command of the Lord.
* It incurs the fault of "Mula-Guna-Viradhana" (violation of fundamental principles).

**Therefore, one should never eat after sunset and before sunrise.**

* One should not eat until the sun's rays are fully risen, as this also incurs a fault.

**The Sutrakar now speaks about the food suitable for Sadhus:**

**Verse 4:**

* **Text:** "Ahaa-Kammam Bhujjamane Sabale."
* **Word by word meaning:** "Ahaa-Kamma - Ahaa-Kamma Bhujjamane - consuming, Sabale - incurs the fault of Shabala."
* **Meaning:** "One who consumes Ahaa-Kamma food incurs the fault of Shabala."
* **Commentary:** "Consuming Ahaa-Kamma food makes the soul tainted with the Shabala fault."

**What is Ahaa-Kamma food?**

* If a Sadhu consumes food prepared with the killing of six-bodied beings, and if the food is prepared for them (the Sadhu) as their own (similar to their usual food), then it is called Ahaa-Kamma food.
* This is explained in detail in the Vritti.

'
“Ahakammamiti-Adhanam-Adha-Sadhunimittam Chetasah Pranidhanam-Yatha-Amuksya Sadhukrite Maya Bhojyaadi Pacaniyamiti, Adhayaah Karma-Pakaadi-Kriyaa-Adha-Karma” Ityadi.
Eating such food destroys the feelings of compassion; because there is no compassion for the living beings whose bodies are eaten.
- Eating Adha-Karma food also violates the first great vow, because eating Adha-Karma food, the three karmas and three yogas are abandoned (left behind), and the vow of non-violence cannot be followed. If a muni eats food made in this way, he will bind the natures of the seven and eight karmas and wander in the cycle of existence. Therefore, a muni should never eat Adha-Karma food.
Now the sutrakar describes the fifth shabala related to Raj-Pind:
Ray-Pindam Bhumjamane Sabale. || 5 || Raj-Pindam Bhujanah Shabala. || 5 || Padarthanvaya-Ray-Pindam-Raj-Pind Bhumjamane-Bhogate Hue Sabale-Shabala Dosha Lagta
Mularth-Eating the food of a king, the Shabala dosha arises.
Tika-This sutra states that a (Jain) sadhu should never take food from the house of a non-Jain king; especially those who have been crowned according to the proper rituals
and who are adorned with signs like a sword, umbrella, crown, and hair ornaments, because this can lead to many faults. For example: 1-Non-Jain kings do not consider what is edible and inedible in their food, 2-Strong food is arousing and therefore not suitable for sadhus, 3-Going to the royal court repeatedly creates various doubts in the minds of the people, 4-It is very likely that someone will consider the arrival of the sadhu inauspicious and cause harm to his body or break his utensils, and 5-It is also possible that someone will consider the sadhu a thief or a spy and cause him harm. All these actions mentioned above and other similar actions can lead to a decline in Jain governance, therefore Rajpind is completely to be avoided.

Page #108:
---------------------------
## Chapter 40: The Dasha-Shruta-Skandha Sutra

**Doubt may arise:** If a king, a Jain follower of the twelve vows, invites monks for a meal through a proclamation, what is the proper course of action for them?

**Resolution:** The prohibition against accepting royal offerings applies only to the path of liberation (utsarga marga), not to the path of exception (apavada marga). The path of exception does not prohibit royal offerings, and this view is consistent with Jain principles. 

The perspective that prohibits royal offerings is valid, and the perspective that allows for their acceptance is also valid. However, due to the possibility of numerous negative consequences, even on the path of exception, the prohibition is generally observed.

**Second Chapter:**

Now, the author of the sutra describes the topic of the fifth type of blemish (shbala dosha):

**Sutra 6:**

"What is bought (kiyam), or borrowed (pamiccam), or taken by force (acchijjam), or taken without permission (anisiddham), or offered in the presence of the worthy (ahardda dijjamana), is a blemish (shbala) for the one who consumes it (bhujjamane)."

**General Meaning:**

**Word by word:** "kiyam" - obtained by paying a price, or "pamiccam" - obtained on credit, or "acchijjam" - taken by force from a weak person, or "anisiddham" - taken without permission, or "ahardda dijjamana" - offered in the presence of the worthy, while consuming (bhujjamane) leads to a blemish (shbala).

**Meaning:** Consuming food obtained through these means leads to a blemish.

**Original Meaning:** Consuming food obtained through purchase, borrowing, taking without permission, taking by force from a weak person, or offered in the presence of the worthy, leads to a blemish.

**Commentary:** This sutra instructs the worthy (sadhu) to abstain from five types of food for the sake of purity. For example, obtaining an item by paying for it in the name of the worthy is called "krita ahar" (bought food). Although there are many variations of this, the main types are:

1. "Atma-dravya-krita" (bought with one's own wealth)
2. "Atma-bhava-dravya-krita" (bought with wealth earned through one's own efforts)
3. "Para-dravya-krita" (bought with another's wealth)
4. "Para-bhava-dravya-krita" (bought with wealth earned through another's efforts)

Consuming such food leads to numerous negative consequences.

---------------------------
## The Second Fault

This section discusses the second fault, "Pramityakam," which refers to accepting offerings from a householder who has borrowed the item from another householder. This is considered inappropriate for a muni (Jain monk) as it can lead to various negative consequences. 

There are two aspects to this fault: worldly and transcendental. The worldly aspect relates to transactions between householders, while the transcendental aspect concerns interactions between monks. 

For example, if a monk accepts an item from another monk with the promise of returning it later or providing a similar item in the future, it can lead to several problems. Firstly, the borrowed item might get damaged, torn, or stolen, causing conflict between the monks. Secondly, the monk who received the item might not be satisfied with the replacement, leading to discord. Therefore, monks should avoid such actions.

## The Third Fault

The third fault is "Acchhinnam," which means accepting an item that has been taken from someone else. This is also considered inappropriate for a muni as it can lead to various negative consequences. 

There are three categories of this fault: related to the owner, related to the master, and related to the thief. 

The difference between an owner and a master is that the owner refers to the leader of a village, while the master refers to the owner of a house. Accepting items taken from these individuals or from a thief can lead to various negative consequences like dislike, conflict, and obstacles. Therefore, monks should avoid accepting such items.

## General Items

It is also inappropriate for a muni to accept general items without the consent of everyone involved. This applies to both individual requests and requests from multiple individuals. Accepting such items without universal consent can lead to conflict and harm the monk's self-control and discipline. 

For example, if someone sells items belonging to a group of individuals and offers some of them to a monk out of devotion, accepting these items can lead to problems if the group finds out. This could even have serious consequences for the monk or the seller. Therefore, monks should avoid accepting such items.

Page #110:
---------------------------
## Chapter 42: The Dasha-Shrutaskandha Sutra, Second Dasha

If someone brings food or other items from elsewhere and offers them to a Sadhu, it is appropriate for the Sadhu to not accept them. This is because there is a possibility of many faults arising from such an act. The person bringing the items may not be discerning about whether they are virtuous or not, and the one receiving them may not be mindful of their own restraint. In such a situation, how can one maintain their restraint? Therefore, it is proven that one should not consume such items to protect their restraint.

Consuming any of the types of food mentioned above leads to the Shabala Dosha (fault) for a Muni. The Samvayanga Sutra only mentions "Uddeshiyam Kiyam, Ahatu Dijjamanam, Bhumjamane Sabale". While explaining this Sutra, the Sutrakar writes: "Ouddeshikham Kritamahritya Diyamanam (cha) Bhumjanah, Upa Lakshanatvat Pramityakachhedya Nisrishta Grahanam Api Atra Drashtavyaam - iti". The Vrittikar, in the Vritti, has included Pramityak, Achhedya, and Anishrishta Doshas through Upa Lakshana. The Dasha-Shrutaskandha Sutra has included these Doshas in the original text itself.

The conclusion is that all the types of food mentioned above should be avoided. Now, the Sutrakar describes the seventh Shabala Dosha.

**Abhikhanam Abhikhanam Padiyaikkhetanam Jaman Sabale || 7 ||**

**Abhikhanam Abhikhanam Pratyakhyaya (Ashanaadi) Bhumjanah Sabale || 7 ||**

**Word by Word Meaning:**

* Abhikhanam 2 - Again and again
* Padiyaikkhetanam - Rejecting
* Bhumjamane - Consuming
* Sabale - Shabala Dosha

**Meaning:**

One who consumes food after rejecting it again and again is afflicted with the Shabala Dosha.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra states that one should not consume something that has been rejected once. One who repeatedly rejects food and then consumes it again and again is afflicted with the Shabala Dosha. This is because such an act leads to the destruction of truth, impatience, breaking of vows, and many other faults.

## The Second Stage

**With Hindi Commentary**

**Obtaining Defects:**  When a person sees the flaws of others, the importance of Jainism diminishes in their heart. They may start to think that there is no point in following the rules and begin to mock the religion. Such individuals become contemptible, and their lack of faith becomes evident to the public, causing the public to lose trust in them.

**Consequences of Breaking Vows:**  Furthermore, the consequences of breaking vows and other actions are unfavorable in both worlds. Therefore, one should completely abandon these actions to avoid acquiring defects like *shabala* and others.

**The Eighth *Shabala* Defect:** Now, the author of the sutra describes the eighth *shabala* defect:

> **"Anto chhanham maasaanam ganaao ganam sankammane sabale."** (8)
> **"Anto shannham maasaanam ganad ganam sankraman shabala."** (8)

**Word-by-Word Meaning:**  *Anto* - within, *chhanham maasaanam* - six months, *ganaao* - from one group, *ganam* - to another group, *sankammane* - while transitioning, *sabale* - the *shabala* defect.

**Meaning:**  If someone transitions from one group to another within six months, they incur the *shabala* defect.

**Commentary:** This sutra explains what a monk should do regarding matters like studying scriptures. If there is no significant benefit in their current group, they should move to another group to gain that benefit. The author of the sutra says:

If a monk feels the need to learn new scriptures for the purification of their karma, but also needs to research forgotten scriptures, and desires to achieve purity in their conduct and serve great souls for the success of their birth, they can move from one group to another with the permission of their guru or elder to gain knowledge, insight, and purity of conduct. However, if they develop a habit of changing groups and start moving from one group to another within six months, they will incur the *shabala* defect. This is because they are still being served in the new group for six months. They may start thinking that the group...

## Chapter 44: Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra, Second Dasha

It is very good to make changes, as it leads to both knowledge and service. However, one seeking Samadhi should never do so, as it weakens the Samadhi and makes it prone to flaws. Additionally, such actions increase one's independence, leading to disbelief from others, rendering them unfit in all ways. Gratitude cannot even remain in such a person.

The essence of all this is that one should not move from one gana to another within six months.

Now, the Sutrakar describes the ninth flaw: "Antomase taso dagaleve karemane sabale." (6) "Antarmasasya trinudakalepaan kurvan shabala." (6)

Word by word meaning: "Masasya - within a month, anto - inside, taso - three, dag - leve - udak (water) ke lep karemane - doing, sabale - flaw."

Meaning: "Within a month, doing three water ablutions leads to a flaw."

Commentary: A sadhu is ordained to travel the land for eight months to spread Dharma. This Sutra explains what they should do if they encounter rivers, lakes, etc. on their journey. The Shastrakar clarifies that if a sadhu encounters a river or lake on their way to a city, they can cross it according to the prescribed method and reach the city. However, if they cross it three times within a month, they become subject to the flaw. This clearly indicates that crossing a water body once or twice within a month, following the prescribed method, does not lead to a flaw. However, doing so for the third time inevitably leads to a flaw.

"The Acharaanga Sutra mentions the thigh as the measure for water ablution, while this Sutra and the Samavayanga Sutra mention the navel as the measure."

The Sutrakar made this statement with the aim of spreading Dharma and protecting life.

Page #113:
---------------------------
## Second Chapter
## With Hindi Commentary

Now the Sutrakar describes the tenth flaw (Shabala Dosha). 

**Sutra 10:**  "Anto maasasss tao maithaane karemane sabale."  || 10 ||
**Translation:** "One who performs three Maya-sthana within a month is considered to have committed the Shabala Dosha." || 10 ||

**Word by Word Meaning:**  "Maasasss" - within a month, "anto" - within, "tao" - three, "maithaane" - Maya-sthana, "karemane" - performing, "sabale" - Shabala Dosha.

**Meaning:**  Performing three Maya-sthana within a month leads to the Shabala Dosha.

**Commentary:** This is an exception Sutra. The use of Maya (deceit, trickery) is completely prohibited. Here, the Sutrakar states that if a monk mistakenly uses Maya-sthana, they should remember that using more than two Maya-sthana leads to the Shabala Dosha.

This statement also suggests that the soul of a deceitful person is filled with the four passions (anger, pride, deceit, and greed), but they always strive to be free from these passions. If, after being freed from them once, they fall back into their use due to delusion, then a rule has been established that a monk who uses Maya-sthana more than twice becomes a participant in the Shabala Dosha.

The conclusion is that one should never use Maya-sthana. Even if someone criticizes with deceit, they will have to perform penance for one month more. This is an exception Sutra, so it speaks about Maya in a general (secondary) way.

Completely abandoning Maya is the best course of action, because only a righteous (pure natured) soul can attain self-purification, not a deceitful one.

In the "Samavayanga Sutra," the word "karemane" is replaced with "sevamanee," and in some written books, "thaane" is replaced with "thaanai."

Page #114:
---------------------------
##  46
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

Now the Sutrakar describes the subject of eleven Shabala Doshas:

**11. Sagariy-Pind Bhumjamane Shabale**

**Word Meaning:** Sagariy - the one who provides shelter, Pind - food, Bhumjamane - consuming, Shabale - Shabala Dosha arises.

**Meaning:** Consuming the food of the one who provides shelter leads to Shabala Dosha.

**Commentary:** The house where a Sadhu stays is called Upashraya or Shayya. The Sutra states that a Sadhu should not accept food or other things from the householder whose house he is staying in, from the date of his stay. This is because doing so can increase the householder's devotion and faith. If food and other things are also taken from the householder's house, it is possible that his feelings towards providing shelter may change. Therefore, the Shastrakaras have prohibited taking anything from his house or anything related to him in any way.

The question may arise: It is fine not to take from a person who does not have devotion, but what is the harm in taking from someone who offers with devotion? The solution is that the rule is the same for everyone and should be followed equally everywhere. If one takes from one person and not from another, there is a fear of animosity among householders. The minds of other Sadhus will also be afflicted by various kinds of thoughts and doubts. For example, a Sadhu staying at a wealthy person's house may think: "Even though he is so wealthy, this person did not invite me for food. What if we stayed at his house?" And so on. There is a possibility of the mind being particularly affected by attachment and aversion due to such thoughts. Therefore, it is best not to take food from the house of the one who provides shelter. This is the word of the Trikala-Hitkari Vitrag Bhagwan.

This Sutra is described as the 'Fifth' in the "Samavayaanga Sutra" and the 'Eleventh' in the Raj-Pind-Vishayak Sutra.

## Second Chapter
## With Hindi Commentary

-

Now the Sutrakar speaks about the subject of *Prāṇātipāta* (killing of living beings):

**"Knowing, one who kills a living being, incurs the *śabala* (impurity) fault."** (12)

**Word-by-word meaning:** *Āuṭṭiāe* - knowing, *pāṇāivāyam* - killing of living beings, *karemāṇe* - doing, *śabale* - incurs the *śabala* fault.

**Meaning:** Knowingly killing a living being results in the *śabala* fault.

**Commentary:** This Sutra explains what kind of killing of living beings leads to the *śabala* fault. It is inevitable to kill living beings by those who are *māyāvī* (deluded). Keeping this in mind, the Sutrakar says that knowingly killing a living being results in the *śabala* fault.

If a *sādhu* (holy person) accepts alms from a householder whose hands or other limbs are stained with *saccitta* (living beings) dust or are wet with *saccitta* water, or who is killing two-sensed beings by fire, by using fans, or by cutting wood, then the *sādhu* will be a partaker of the *śabala* fault. Additionally, if a *sādhu* is himself engaged in *prāṇātipāta* and harbors hatred in his mind or speaks hateful words to someone, he will also incur the *śabala* fault.

It is clear that if *prāṇātipāta* happens unknowingly, then the *śabala* fault does not occur, but it happens only when it is done knowingly.

It is established that a person who desires *samādhi* (meditation) should not engage in *prāṇātipāta* and should not harbor hatred towards anyone.

After *prāṇātipāta*, the Sutrakar now speaks about *mṛṣā-vāda* (false speech):

**"Knowing, one who speaks false speech, incurs the *śabala* fault."** (13)

**Word-by-word meaning:** *Āuṭṭiāe* - knowing, *musā-vāyam* - false speech, *vadamāṇe* - speaking, *śabale* - incurs the *śabala* fault.

Page #116:
---------------------------
## 48
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Original Meaning: Knowingly speaking untruth leads to Shabala Dosha.

## Second Dasha
## Commentary: This Sutra describes Mrisha-Vada (false speech) in the same way as Pranatipat (violence). For example, knowingly speaking untruth, presenting a doubtful matter as certain, concealing the true nature of an object by lying, and creating false pretense for fame and glory are all considered Shabala Dosha. Even if someone uses untruth due to the influence of an appropriate style of discourse, Sutra interpretation, or greed for disciples, it still incurs Shabala Dosha.

The question arises: Why is it called Shabala Dosha when untruthful speech violates the second Maha-Vrata (great vow)? Shouldn't it be called Maha-Vrata-Bhang Dosha? The answer is that Maha-Vrata-Bhang arises from even more serious causes like untruth and other factors. For example, falsely imagining and stating the opposite of the true nature of an object without knowing it. Here, the statement seems to be only about Dravya-Asatya (material untruth). However, those seeking Samadhi (liberation) should strive to avoid even this. For example, violence by a king, etc., is the cause of Maha-Mohaniya Karma (heavy karmic action), but the killing of living beings due to bathing, etc., although violence, does not have the same intensity of emotions. Similarly, one should understand the matter of Mrisha-Vada.

## After Mrisha-Vada, the Sutrakar now speaks about Adatta-Dana (accepting unoffered gifts):
## Autyyae Adiṇṇadāṇam Giṇhmāṇe Sabale || 14 ||

## Akutya Adatta Danam Grinhan Shabala || 14 ||
## Word by Word Meaning: Adiṇṇadāṇam - unoffered gift, Autyyae - having, Sabale - Shabala Dosha arises.
## Original Meaning: Knowingly accepting an unoffered gift leads to Shabala Dosha.

## Commentary: This Sutra states that knowingly accepting something without permission leads to Shabala Dosha. However, this does not refer to major offenses like theft, but only to accepting a simple object without permission. For example, imagine an object that belongs to ten people, meaning ten people are entitled to it.
## A - Knowingly, Giṇhmāṇe - accepting.

## Second Stage
**With Hindi Commentary**

**me**
If one uses a substance without the permission of the other nine, they will incur the fault of *Shabala Dosa*.

**46**
However, stealing money, grain, animals, women, etc., breaking locks, robbing, looting, and making a pact in a house, all constitute a violation of the *Mahavrata*. This is because these actions violate the third *Mahavrata*. Therefore, in this matter, one should consider *Atikrama*, *Vyatikrama*, and *Atichara* as *Shabala Dosa*. It is established that one should never accept a gift that is not given.

According to the *Vyavahar Nay*, *Shabala Dosa* arises only from the transition (change) of emotions.

Now, the sutrakar speaks about the protection of the earth-body:

**Auttiyae Anantar-Hiaae Pudhavieae Thaanam Va Nisihiyam Va Chetamaane Sabale. || 15 ||**
**Akutya Anantarhitaayaam Prithivyaam Sthanam Va Naisheidhikam Va Chetayan Shabala. || 15 ||**

**Word by Word Meaning:**
* **Auttiyae** - Knowing
* **Anantar-Hiaae** - With a conscious mind
* **Pudhavieae** - On the earth
* **Thaanam** - To perform *Kayotsarga* (abandonment of the body)
* **Va** - Or
* **Nisihiyam** - To sit
* **Va** - Or
* **Chetamaane** - While doing other actions
* **Sabale** - *Shabala Dosa* is incurred.

**Meaning:**
Knowing and performing *Kayotsarga* continuously on the earth with a conscious mind, sitting, and performing other similar actions, all incur *Shabala Dosa*.

**Commentary:**
This sutra states that every individual should diligently protect the earth-body beings. Only then can the practice of *Sanayama* and *Aradhana* be carried out according to the rules.

Knowing and performing *Kayotsarga* continuously on the earth with a conscious mind, studying, sleeping, sitting, and performing other similar actions, all incur *Shabala Dosa*. This is because the one who knowingly performs such actions will not have the feeling of protecting the earth-body beings in their mind.

Page #118:
---------------------------
##  Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra, Second Dasha

**It can remain as long as one is striving to protect those beings. As soon as the feeling of protection disappears from one's mind, at that very moment, one's soul will become filled with self-violence and restraint-violence.**

**It has been established that one should not perform any of the aforementioned actions on the sentient earth.** This is mentioned first because it is the main cause of samadhi.

**In some copies, "Sejjam va" (Shayanam va), meaning "to sleep on the sentient earth," is also found. However, this reading is not present in the "Samavayaanga Sutra," but only in the copies of the present study.**

**The Sutrakar states in the following Sutra:**

**"Evam Sasniddaae Puḍavīe Evam Sasarakkhaae Puḍavīe." (16)**

**"Evam Sasnigdhaayaam Prithivyaam, Evam Sarajaskaayaam Prithivyaam." (16)**

**Word-by-word meaning:**

**Evam -** In this way, **Sasniddaae -** on the smooth earth, **Puḍavīe -** earth, **Athaava -** or, **Evam -** in this way, **Sasarakkhaae -** on the sentient dust-filled earth, **Puḍavīe -** earth, **Kayotsarga -** shedding of the body, **Tathaa -** and, **Swaadhyaayaadi -** study and other actions, **Kriyaae -** should not be performed.

**Main meaning:**

**In this way, one should not perform actions like shedding the body, study, etc., on the smooth and sentient dust-filled earth.**

**Commentary:**

**Like the previous Sutra, this Sutra also discusses the protection of earth-dwelling beings.**

**The earth that is mixed with water and sand (muddy earth) is called "Snigdha" and the earth that is very smooth due to sentient and non-sentient dust is called "Sarajask." Performing actions like shedding the body, study, and sleeping on both types of earth leads to a decrease in compassion. Therefore, keeping in mind the protection of beings, one should not perform these actions on the sentient earth for the sake of one's physical comfort. Because the result of harming beings has never been pleasant and never will be.**

Page #119:
---------------------------
## Second Chapter
**With Hindi Commentary**

“In the Samvayanga Sutra, the following text is found at the place of this Sutra:
“Evam auttiā citta-mantāe puḍavīae auttiā citta-mantāe silāe kolāvāsa-si vā dāru-e ṭhāṇaṁ vā sijj vā nisīhi-aṁ vā ceta-māṇe sabale” || 16 || (Evam ākuṭyā cittavatyāṁ pṛthivyāṁ ākuṭyā cittavatyāṁ śilāyāṁ leṣṭau vā kolāvāse dāruṇi ityādi) ‘Kolā:-ghuṇāḥ, teṣām āvāsaḥ iti vṛttiḥ”. But even though there is a difference in the text, the meaning of both is the same.

Now the Sutrakar speaks about the protection of life:
Evam auttiāe citta-mantāe silāe citta-mantāe lelu-e kolāvāsa-si vā dāru-jīva-payatṭhi-e sa-aṇḍe sa-pāṇe sabī-e sa-hari-e sa-ose sa-udage sa-uttiṅge paṇaga-dag maṭṭī-e makkada-santāṇ-e taha-ppa-gāraṁ ṭhāṇaṁ vā sijj vā nisīhi-yaṁ vā ce-e-māṇe sabale. || 17 ||
Evam ākuṭyā cittavatyāṁ śilāyāṁ cittavati leṣṭau kolāvāse vā, dāruṇi jīva-pratiṣṭhite, sāṇḍe, saprāṇe, sabīje, saharite soṣe sodake sottiṅge, paṇakadak-mṛttikāyāṁ, markata-santāne, tathāprakāraṁ sthānaṁ vā śayanaṁ vā naiṣedhikāṁ vā cetayān (kurvan) śabalaḥ. || 17 ||

**Word-by-word meaning:**
Evam - in this way, auttiāe - going, citta-mantāe - having consciousness, silāe - on the stone, citta-mantāe - having consciousness, lelu-e - on the stone slab, vā - or, kolāvāsa-si - on the wood where insects live, vā - or, dāru-jīva-payatṭhi-e - on the wood where life resides, sa-aṇḍe - where there are eggs, sa-pāṇe - where there are beings with two senses, sabī-e - where there are seeds, sa-hari-e - where there is greenery, sa-ose - where there is dew, sa-udage - where there is water, sa-uttiṅge - where there are ant hills, paṇaga-dag - where there are five colored flowers, maṭṭī-e - in the soil, makkada-santāṇ-e - in the web of the spider, taha-ppa-gāraṁ - in such other places, where there is a possibility of harming life, ṭhāṇaṁ - to defecate, vā - or, sijj - to sleep, vā - or, nisīhi-yaṁ - to sit, vā - in the collective sense, ce-e-māṇe - while doing these actions, sabale - it is a śabala (minor) fault.

Page #120:

52
Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
:
Original Meaning - In the same way, knowingly, on a sentient stone, on a sentient stone pebble, on wood with worms, which is inhabited by living beings, and in places where there are eggs, animals, seeds, green plants, dew (Avashaya) water, insect cities, five colored flowers, Dak soil (soil mixed with sentient water - mud), Merkat (Koliya being) offspring (jala) etc. and where there is a possibility of harming living beings, performing actions like shedding the body, sleeping and sitting, etc. results in Shabala Dosha.
Second Dasha
Commentary - This Sutra lays down the law regarding the protection of the six-bodied beings. Until the soul is diligent in protecting living beings, it is not impossible to follow the first great vow, but it will certainly be difficult to achieve.

Therefore, it is proven that every action should be performed diligently. And knowingly, on a sentient (consciousness-filled - living being-filled) stone or stone child (piece of stone), surrounded by worms and other similar beings, i.e., filled with worms, etc., filled with eggs, filled with two-sense beings, etc., filled with seeds, filled with green-bodied beings, filled with dew, filled with water, filled with beings that make burrows in the earth, filled with five colored flowers, filled with water and soil (muddy), filled with Merkat offspring (Karmaat offspring - Kolika jalakanlut putka wa - spider webs), and in other such places, for the protection of living beings, one should not perform actions like shedding the body, sleeping and sitting, etc., because this will inevitably lead to harming living beings and then the occurrence of Shabala Dosha is inevitable. Therefore, with full diligence, one should look at the place and purify it before performing the aforementioned actions.
The question arises that the Sutra mentions earth, water, plants and three-bodied beings, but nothing is said about the beings of fire and air. Should they not be protected? In response, it is said that actions like shedding the body, etc., can only be performed on wood, etc., therefore, there is a possibility of harming the beings living in them through these actions, but the beings of fire and air do not have such a dwelling place where actions like shedding the body, etc., can harm living beings, therefore, the scripture writer did not include them in the said Sutra, considering it inappropriate to include them.

Page #121:
---------------------------
## Second Stage
**With Hindi Commentary**

Because the protection of living beings is essential for Samadhi, therefore, by implication, one must also protect the Tejas-kaya and Vayu-kaya beings. For example, to protect the Agni-kaya beings, one should not sit where the Agni-kaya beings are being born, and in the cold season, one should not sit near the fire and consume it. Because, by doing so, when the fire becomes less or more, there will definitely be many kinds of resolutions and alternatives in the mind, and from time to time, one will have to put fuel (wood) etc. in it to make it burn more, which will inevitably lead to the violation of Agni-kaya beings. Similarly, one should also know about Vayu-kaya beings. Only if one makes an effort to prevent explosions etc., can one protect Vayu-kaya beings.

53
The meaning of the entire statement is that one should observe the first great vow only after being free from the defects of weakness.

Now, to prove the predominance of plants, the Sutrakar again speaks about plants.

**Auktyae mul-bhoyanam va kand-bhoyanam va khand-bhoyanam va taya-bhoyanam va, paval-bhoyanam va patt-bhoyanam va pupf-bhoyanam va phal-bhoyanam va biy-bhoyanam va hariy-bhoyanam va bhunjamane sabale. || 18 ||**

**Word-by-word meaning:**

Auktyae - knowing, mul-bhoyanam - eating roots or, kand-bhoyanam - eating tubers or, khand-bhoyanam - eating stems or, taya-bhoyanam - eating bark or, paval-bhoyanam - eating corals or, patt-bhoyanam - eating leaves or, pupf-bhoyanam - eating flowers or, phal-bhoyanam - eating fruits or, biy-bhoyanam - eating seeds or,

## 54

**Green Food -** Green - what is food or in the collective sense, what is eaten - while eating - enjoying - all - a strong fault arises.

**Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra**

**Original Meaning -** Knowing the root, tuber, stem, bark, sprout, leaf, flower, fruit, seed and green, eating them causes a strong fault.

**Commentary -** This sutra clearly states that a sadhu should never eat a sentient plant. If the muni does not understand this, then his first great vow will be tainted with a strong fault.

1. Root
2. Tuber
3. Stem
4. Bark

In this sutra, the word "eating" is taken from the perspective of "principles". Like "eating, eating", transgression, violation and excess can lead to a strong fault. If only unrighteousness is consumed, it will not be called a strong fault. Therefore, it is proven that one should always be protected from the strong fault related to plants.

The following ten types of plants are described in the original sutra:

5. Sprout
6. Leaf
7. Flower
8. Fruit
9. Seed

**Second Stage**

* Onion, radish, etc.
* Lotus, vidari tuber, etc.
* Branches that sprout above the ground.
* Bark.
* New leaves, buds (shoots), etc.
* Betel, creeper leaves, etc.
* Madhuka flowers, etc.
* Cucumber, gourd, mango, etc.
* Grain, etc.
10. Green:
* Durva, etc.

One should not consume any of these sentient plants. Just like sentient plants, one should also know about sentient clay and water, etc.

"Outtiae Mool-Bhoyanam wa, Kand-Bhoyanam wa, Taya-Bhoyanam, Pawal-Bhoyanam, Pupf-Bhoyanam, Hariy-Bhoyanam wa, Bhumjamane Sabale" || 18 ||

55

But the meaning of all these Sutras is the same. That is, one should not eat with a mind and without awareness.

Now the Sutrakar speaks about the protection of water-bodied beings:
Anto Sanvatcharass Das Dag-Leve Karemane Sabale || 16 ||

Antah Samvatsarasya Dasodakalepaan Kurvan Shabala || 16 ||

Paddarthanvaya - Sambatcharass - within one year, Anto - within, Das Dag - ten water, Leve - application, Karemane - doing, Sabale - Shabala dosha occurs.

Mool-arth - Within one year, applying ten water applications leads to Shabala dosha.

Teeka - In this Sutra, the subject of the previously mentioned ninth Sutra is again clarified.
I
For example, in the ninth Sutra, it was described that taking a dip in water bodies three times within a month leads to Shabala dosha. It automatically comes to mind that taking a dip in water once or twice does not lead to Shabala dosha or the transgression of the Lord's command.

From this statement, some crooked and dull-minded people should not think that taking a dip in water three times in a month leads to Shabala dosha, and if done twice, it does not. Therefore, there is no objection to taking a dip in rivers and other water bodies 24 times within a year. Keeping in mind the argument of those disciples, this Sutra states that...

Page #124:
---------------------------
## 56
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Second Dasha

**More than nine immersions in rivers and other water bodies within one year leads to the Shabala Dosha.**

Sri Sarvjna Prabhu, keeping in mind the spirit of Dharma-Prachar and Jeeva-Raksha, has stated that one should not immerse in water more than ten times within a year. If someone does so, they will incur both Agyna-Bhang and Shabala Dosha.

The Sutra-karta's intention is particularly towards Jeeva-Raksha, hence this Sutra is composed to negate the aforementioned argument. It also conveys that every action should be performed with the support of Utsarga and Apavad Marg. And every being should act according to the Anekanta-Marg (Syadvad) to achieve their Purushartha for the understanding of actions and objects. Only then can the desired object be achieved.

Now the Sutrakar speaks again about Maya-Sthanas:

**"Anto Samvatcharasss Das Mai Thaanai Karemane Sabale." (20)**

**Word by Word:**

Samvatcharasss - within one year, Anto - within, Das - ten, Mai - Maya, Thaanai - places, Karemane - doing, Sabale - Shabala Dosha.

**Meaning:**

Within one year, doing ten Maya-Sthanas leads to Shabala Dosha.

**Commentary:**

The tenth Sutra states that consuming Maya-Sthanas three times within a month leads to Shabala Dosha. It is possible that someone, trying to find fault, might misinterpret this and consume Maya-Sthanas twenty-four times in a year. Therefore, the Sutrakar states here that consuming Maya-Sthanas ten times in a year leads to Shabala Dosha.

The consumption of Maya-Sthanas is not prescribed as a rule, but is mentioned here as an exception. Therefore, no one should be eager to consume them, but should try to abandon them as much as possible. Because they are completely to be abandoned, and there is only merit in abandoning them.

Page #125:
---------------------------
## Second Chapter
## With Hindi Commentary

Here, this Sutra is also an exception to the tenth Sutra. The meaning is that consuming more than nine Maya-sthans within a year leads to Shabala Dosha. Or, at this place, this statement appears to be about Anantaanubandhini, Apratyakhyayini, or Pratyakhyayini Maya. 

_Now, the Sutrakar again speaks about the protection of Jal-Kaya beings:_

**Auttiyae Sito-day-viyad-vagghari-hatyeṇ vā matteṇ vā daviṇṇ vā bhāyeṇ vā asanṃ vā pāṇṃ vā khāimṃ vā sāimṃ vā paḍigāhitta bhuñjamāṇe sabale. || 21 ||**

_Aakutya sito dakavikat-vyapari-tena hastena vā amatreṇ (patreṇ) vā dā vā bhājane k asanṃ vā pāṇṃ vā khāimṃ vā svādim vā prati-grihya bhujanah sabale. || 21 ||_

**Word by Word Meaning:**

Auttiyae - knowing, viyad - with mind, sito-day - cold water, vagghari - smeared, hattheṇ - with hand, vā - or, matteṇ - with vessel, vā - or, daviṇṇ - with a piece of cloth, vā - or, bhāyeṇ - with a utensil, asanṃ vā - food, vā - or, pāṇṃ - water, vā - or, khāimṃ - edible substance, vā - or, sāimṃ - delicious substance, vā - or, any other worthy substance, paḍigāhitta - taking, bhuñjamāṇe - while eating, sabale - Shabala Dosha occurs.

**Original Meaning:**

Knowing that the hand is smeared with cold water, taking food, water, edible substance, or delicious substance from a vessel, a piece of cloth, or a utensil leads to Shabala Dosha.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra again discusses the protection of Jal-Kaya beings. For example, if a Sadhu goes to a householder's house for alms, and at that time, the householder is performing bathing rituals, and his hands and other limbs are not only smeared with water but also dripping with water, then it is appropriate for the Sadhu to not accept food, water, edible substances, or delicious substances from his hands, vessel, piece of cloth, or utensil. This is because accepting such things leads to Shabala Dosha due to the violation of Jal-Kaya beings.

Page #126:
---------------------------
##  58. Dasha-Shruta-Skandha Sutra

The principle that emerged is that the protection of aquatic beings is as essential as the protection of terrestrial beings, because the protection of restraint depends on the protection of life.

**Second Stage**

Humans have a special relationship with water, therefore, special care is needed in protecting aquatic beings. Hence, statements related to water are made again. In the 'Samavayanga Sutra', the following text is found: "Abhikhanam 2 Sitodaya - Viyad-Vaggariyapanina Asanam va Panam va Khaimang va Saimang va Padigahitta Bhumjamane Sabale." || 21 ||

Some handwritten manuscripts contain the following text: "Auttiyae Siodag, Raugdhannam Vaggariyannm" etc. - This means (Raj Udghat) just as there is a rainfall of dust, in the same way, drops of water fall from the body, etc. The meaning of all the above texts is that while making efforts to protect aquatic beings, one should also protect the six-bodied beings.

The question may arise that all the Shabala-doshas mentioned so far are related to character; are there no Shabala-doshas related to knowledge and vision? In response, it is said that there are Shabala-doshas related to knowledge and vision, but it is the prerogative of character, therefore, only Shabala-doshas related to character are described here.

Now the question arises why the subject of character is mentioned first, leaving the order aside? In response, it is said that the subject of character comes after vision and knowledge, and that character is only possible with vision and knowledge. Therefore, one should know the Shabala-doshas of all three. The Shabala-doshas of vision are doubt, desire, uncertainty, praise of false vision, and commendation of false vision. And the Shabala-doshas of knowledge are untimely study, disrespect for knowledge, not performing penance, hiding knowledge, reversal of sutras and meaning (order difference), and reading sutras in reverse order (leaving the order).

The conclusion is that aspiring souls should strive to purify themselves by abandoning the Shabala-doshas of right vision, right knowledge, and right conduct, so that they can attain the state of Nirvana.

Second Chapter
With Hindi Commentary.

Now the Sutrakar, concluding the present study, says:
"These, indeed, are the twenty-one *shabala* (imperfections) declared by the *theras* (elders) - thus I say."
Thus ends the second chapter.

Word-by-word meaning:
*ete* - these, *khalu* - indeed, *te* - those, *theraihi* - elders, *bhagawantaihi* - by the Bhagavants, *ekabisa* - twenty-one, *sabala* - *shabala* (imperfections), *pannatta* - declared, *tti* - thus, *bemi* - I say. *iti* - thus, *biiya* - second, *dasa* - chapter, *samatta* - ended.

Meaning:
These, indeed, are the twenty-one *shabala* (imperfections) declared by the elder Bhagavants.

Commentary:
Concluding the chapter presented in this Sutra, the Sutrakar says that these twenty-one *shabala* (imperfections) have been declared by the elder Bhagavants. The elder Bhagavants are described as follows:
"Like the Jinas, they are not Jinas, but like the Jinas, they speak truthfully."
Therefore, their statement is worthy of acceptance. And because their statement is like the word of the Bhagavant, it is authoritative.

The subject matter is mentioned in the *Anga* scriptures, the *Samavayanga Sutra*, and is therefore universally accepted. This is why it is said in the Sutra, "Thus I say."

Shri Sudharmacharaya Swami Ji says to his disciple Shri Jambu Swami Ji, "O Jambu! Just as I heard this subject from Shri Shraman Bhagavan Shri Mahavira Swami Ji, so I have told you, but I have not said anything from my own intellect."

Page #128:
---------------------------
## The Third Stage

The second stage detailed twenty-one *shabala* (imperfections) in detail. Just as character becomes tainted with *shabala* due to actions like stealing, harming, etc., similarly, the character of a devotee of the Three Jewels becomes tainted by harboring *ashaatana* towards an Acharya or Guru. By abandoning *ashaatana*, the path to Samadhi becomes free of obstacles. Therefore, in relation to the first and second stages, the author describes thirty-three *ashaatana* in this third stage.

Now, the question arises: what is *ashaatana*? The answer is: "That which weakens, destroys, and diminishes knowledge, perception, and character is *ashaatana*." In other words, *ashaatana* is the breaking of character caused by transgression, violation, and excess, arising from improper conduct, unrighteous behavior, and violation of the fundamental vows.

There are two main categories of *ashaatana*: *mithya-praatipaadan* (false propagation) and *mithya-praatipatti-laabh* (gaining false perception). To falsely claim a fabricated nature of substances, without knowing their true nature, is called *mithya-praatipaadan* *ashaatana*. And to falsely accuse revered individuals like Gurus, and consider oneself superior to them, is called *mithya-praatipatti-laabh* *ashaatana*.

In essence, actions that weaken or violate character are the true *ashaatana*, because they lead to a lack of humility in the soul.

Page #129:
---------------------------
## The Third Chapter

**With Hindi Commentary**

It is essential to have aspirations related to knowledge, vision, and character. In addition to these, numerous causes for aspirations related to substance, space, time, emotions, scriptures, gods, goddesses, scriptural gods, lay followers, beings, ghosts, souls, essence, and the five supreme beings like Arhat, etc., have been described. One should understand them through their characteristics. How can a person whose knowledge, etc., is already weak, worship them? Therefore, one should eliminate aspirations and properly worship knowledge, etc.

Now, the author of the sutra, while describing this topic in the original sutra, says:

"I have heard, O venerable disciple, thus spoken by the Blessed One: In this Jain tradition, thirty-three aspirations have been declared by the venerable ones. Which are those thirty-three aspirations declared by the venerable ones? These are those thirty-three aspirations declared by the venerable ones. For example:

**Word-by-word meaning:**

O venerable disciple, I have heard, thus spoken by the Blessed One: In this Jain tradition, the venerable ones have declared thirty-three aspirations. The disciple asks, which are those thirty-three aspirations declared by the venerable ones? The teacher replies, these are those thirty-three aspirations declared by the venerable ones. For example:

Page #130:
---------------------------
##  04
##  Sh62
##  DashaShrutaSkandha Sutra
##  Third Dasha

**Original Meaning:**  O learned disciple! I have heard that the Lord has stated this. In this Jain religion, the elder Bhagavants have stated thirty-three Ashatanas. The disciple asked, "Which thirty-three Ashatanas have the elder Bhagavants stated?" The Guru replied, "The thirty-three Ashatanas that will be mentioned are the ones that the elder Bhagavants have stated."

**Commentary:**  Similar to the previous two Dasha, this Dasha also begins with the question-answer style of Guru and disciple, which makes the authenticity of the words of the omniscient and the understanding of the inquisitive easy.

It is also appropriate to mention here that the Ganadharas are also called elder Bhagavants, or the Munis from the fourteen previous holders of the Dharma to the ten previous holders of the Dharma are also called elder Bhagavants or Shruta-Kevali. The statements made using all of these are also considered to be of the highest level of proof.

Now the Sutrakar describes the Ashatanas in detail:

**1.**  One who goes to the **Rayani** (a type of hell) from afar is an **Ashatana** of a thousand.
**2.**  One who goes to the **Rayani** from the side is an **Ashatana** of a thousand.
**3.**  One who goes to the **Rayani** from nearby is an **Ashatana** of a thousand.
**4.**  One who is born in the **Rayani** from afar is an **Ashatana** of a thousand.
**5.**  One who is born in the **Rayani** from the side is an **Ashatana** of a thousand.
**6.**  One who is born in the **Rayani** from nearby is an **Ashatana** of a thousand.
**7.**  One who dies in the **Rayani** from afar is an **Ashatana** of a thousand.
**8.**  One who dies in the **Rayani** from the side is an **Ashatana** of a thousand.
**9.**  One who dies in the **Rayani** from nearby is an **Ashatana** of a thousand.

## Chapter 64: Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra, Third Dasha

**Verse 0:**

**Original Meaning:** When walking, standing, or sitting in front of, at the same level as, or very close to the Ratnakara (teacher), the student experiences Ashatana (disrespect).

**Commentary:** This Sutra discusses nine types of Ashatana. The Nirukta-kara (etymologist) explains the word "Ashatana" as follows: "Tatra-ayaha-samyagdarshanadyavaptilkshanastasya shatana-khandana-nirukta-ashatana." This means that Ashatana is the act of breaking or destroying the attainment of right vision, etc. The "ya" in the word "ayaha" is dropped due to the rule "prishoudaraaditvat lopha." This is how the word "Ashatana" is derived.

In common parlance, Ashatana is what we call disrespect or rudeness. While the word "Ashatana" encompasses all forms of rudeness, here it specifically refers to disrespect. This is because respect and courtesy bring happiness and peace to all beings, making them desirable for everyone.

In the Sutra, the words "Ratnakara" and "Shaiksha" are used in contrasting meanings. The implication is that "Shaiksha" refers to the smaller, while "Ratnakara" refers to the larger. The word "Shaiksha" denotes the smaller, and "Ratnakara" denotes the larger.

Now, a question arises: What is the difference between the smaller and larger in the worldly and transcendental contexts? The answer is that in worldly affairs, "smaller" and "larger" are usually determined by birth and position. However, in the transcendental context, "smaller" and "larger" are determined by initiation and position. The Vrittikara (commentator) clarifies this by saying, "Avam agitartho laghu," meaning that in terms of education and initiation, the smaller is smaller, and the larger is larger. Except for the Acharya and Upadhyaya, the rest of the Muni-varga (order of monks) are addressed as "Shaiksha."

"Ratnakara" is the name given to someone who has been initiated recently. Due to their abundance of qualities, they are called "Ratnakara," meaning "mine of jewels." It is with reference to them that the thirty-three Ashatanas are mentioned in this Sutra.

Of the thirty-three Ashatanas, the first nine relate to the three actions of walking, standing, and sitting. For example, it is considered Ashatana for a student to walk in front of, at the same level as, or behind the Acharya, Upadhyaya, or a senior Ratnakara while touching their clothes.

Page #133:
---------------------------
## The Third Stage

**With Hindi Commentary**

It is expected to walk behind the Guru. However, due to special circumstances, there may be exceptions to this path of following. For example, if the Guru does not know the path, or if a group of dogs or other animals are sitting ahead, or if any other reason arises, then there is no fault in walking ahead of the Ratnakar. Similarly, if the Guru is very tired, or has pain in his eyes, or is about to faint, then there is no shame in walking alongside him. And if animals are coming from behind, then there is no shame in touching his clothes, etc., to protect the Guru.

**65**

However, one should never touch the clothes, etc., of the Guru or other elders without reason, because doing so may cause the dust from the disciple's feet to touch the Guru, and there may also be a possibility of other impurities like mucus, etc. Therefore, it is appropriate to walk only according to the method mentioned above, only then can the disciple avoid shame. Like the act of walking, the acts of 'sitting' and 'standing' should also be performed in such a way as to avoid shame, otherwise many faults may arise.

If the Guru is very tired or suffering from pain like colic, etc., then there is no shame in sitting near the Guru and serving him with the consent of the physician and the Guru's command. But behaving inappropriately and rudely with him (the Guru) - while walking, standing, and sitting - will definitely lead to shame.

**I**

Every knowledgeable person should learn from this sutra that it is appropriate to always behave politely with those who are older than oneself. As we see every day, the result of rudeness is experienced in this world and in this life itself. Therefore, it is appropriate for a person who desires his own well-being to completely abandon rudeness and always remain humble.

Now the sutra-maker describes the subject of the 10th shame:

**"When going out to the field of contemplation with a Rayani, if one sits ahead of him, and then later becomes a Rayani, that is shame."**

**Sehass. 10.**

## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Third Dasha

If a student, along with a Ratnakara, goes out to the excretion ground, and the student performs ablutions before the Ratnakara, then the student experiences Ashatana. ||10||

**Word by Word Meaning:**

* Sehe - student
* Rayaniyeṇaṁ - Ratnakara
* Saddiṁ - with
* Bahiya - outside
* Va - or
* Viyara - excretion
* Bhūmi - ground
* Nikkhaṁte - goes
* Samaṇe - being
* Tattha - there
* Puvvataraag - before
* Sehe - student
* Ayamāi - performs ablutions
* Pacchā - after
* Rayaniye - Ratnakara
* Sehass - student
* Asāyāna - Ashatana
* Bhavai - happens

**Meaning:**

If a student goes to the excretion ground with a Ratnakara, and the student performs ablutions before the Ratnakara, then the student experiences Ashatana.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra discusses the topics of cleanliness and humility. For example, if a Ratnakara and a student go to the excretion ground together, and they both take water from the same vessel, and place it at a designated spot, and then go to different places to perform excretion, if the student comes back first and performs ablutions before the Ratnakara, then the student experiences Ashatana. This is because it violates humility and also leads to the soul being in an inattentive state due to the absence of the Ratnakara. Therefore, if water is taken from the same vessel, the student should never perform ablutions before the Ratnakara. The student should perform ablutions only after the Ratnakara has done so.

Now, the question arises, if the water is not in the same vessel, but in separate vessels, then how should ablutions be performed? The solution is that if a monk has a separate vessel for ablutions, then they should not keep it too close to the excretion ground, nor too far away, but at a moderate distance. While performing ablutions, one should also ensure that they are not performed at the excretion ground itself, nor too far away, but at a moderate distance, so that they can become pure and fit for study.

The 'Thananga Sutra' describes ten chapters in its tenth chapter. Among them, the fourth chapter is called 'Ashuchi-Samant'. The 'Vyavahar Sutra' states in its seventh chapter, "No Kappāi Nigganthāṇam Va Nigganthine Va".

Page #135:
---------------------------
## Third Chapter

**With Hindi Commentary**

In this chapter, one should not engage in self-study while impure, nor should one engage in self-study when the body is impure. The same topic is described in the 'Acharang Sutra' as well. In the seventh study of the 'Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra', it is also stated that water must be taken to remove impurity, meaning one should cleanse oneself with water. In the ninth study of the 'Suyagadaang Sutra', it is written that these actions should not be performed on a green-bodied person. The 'Nishith Sutra' also prescribes the method of purification with water. The 'Nishith Sutra' also describes that one should never cleanse the anal region with wood or other materials after defecation. However, the 'Sthanang Sutra' describes purification in five ways: 1. Purification with earth, 2. Purification with water, 3. Purification with fire, 4. Purification with mantra, 5. Purification with ashes. The meaning is that the type of purification is done according to the type of waste. This sutra only describes that if there is water in the same vessel, the disciple should not take a sip (purify) before the guru.

**67**

However, there can be exceptions, such as when the guru instructs the disciple to quickly purify and go to the shelter at the end of the day, or if any other special reason arises, then the disciple does not feel ashamed to purify before the guru. But all this depends on the guru's command.

Now the sutra-maker describes the eleventh Ashatana:

**He Raayaniṇam Saddiṁ Bahiya Viyaar-Bhūmiṁ Va Vihaar-Bhūmiṁ Va Nikkhate Samaṇe Taththa Sehe Puvvataraagṁ Aaloei Paচ্ছা Yaṇie Aasayāṇa Sehass. ||11||**

**Shaiksho Raatniken Sardham Bahirva Viyaar-Bhumiṁ Va Vihaar-Bhūmiṁ Va Nishkraantaḥ San-Tatra Shaikshaḥ Purvatarakam Alochayati Pacchaad Raatnik Aashatana Shaikshasya ||11||**

**Word-by-word meaning:** Sehe - disciple, Raayaniṇam - Ratnakar, Saddiṁ - with, Bahiya - outside, Viyaar - Bhūmiṁ - place of study, Va - or, Vihaar-Bhūmiṁ - place of recreation, Va - or, Nikkhate - goes out, Samaṇe - together, Taththa - there, Sehe - disciple, Puvvataraagṁ - earlier, Aaloei - observes, Paচ্ছা - after, Yaṇie - Ratnakar, Aasayāṇa - Ashatana, Sehass - of the disciple.

Page #136:

## 68
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Third Dasha

If a disciple, before the Guru, criticizes the previous actions in the *Iriya-Bahi* (conduct), then the *Ratnakar* (learned one) criticizes afterwards, the disciple feels *Asayatna* (discomfort).

**Meaning:** When a disciple goes out with the *Ratnakar* to the *Vichar-Bhoomi* (place of contemplation), and there, the disciple criticizes before the Guru, and the Guru criticizes afterwards, the disciple feels *Asayatna*.

**Commentary:** This Sutra teaches about the *Vinaya* (discipline) related to the *Ratnakar*. For example, if a disciple goes out with the Guru to the *Uccar-Bhoomi* (place of recitation) or *Swadhyay-Bhoomi* (place of self-study), and after returning to the *Upashraya* (monastery) after the *Swakarya* (self-work), the disciple starts criticizing the actions done during the journey before the Guru, i.e., without the Guru's permission, the disciple starts criticizing the actions done while coming and going, then the disciple feels *Asayatna* because it breaks the *Vinaya*.

However, if the Guru, for some reason, gives permission to the disciple to criticize the actions in the *Iriya-Bahi*, then even if the disciple criticizes before the Guru, the disciple does not feel *Asayatna*.

While explaining the Sutra, the *Vrittikar* (commentator) writes, "Vichar-Bhoomi is the name of Uccar-Bhoomi, and Vihar-Bhoomi is the name of Swadhyay-Bhoomi." But in the "Jainagma-Shabda-Sangrah-Kosh" (Ardhamagadhi-Gujarati), on page 702, it is written: "Vihar-Pu. (Vihar) means play, fun, a monastery for monks, wandering from one place to another, self-study, a settlement outside the city, a place for excreting waste, a special ritual, a path described by the Bhagavan, a feat, conduct, and rules." The word "Vihar" is used in these eight meanings. The word "Vihar-Bhoomi" is used only in two meanings. For example, on the same page of the above-mentioned Kosh, it is written: "Vihar-Bhoomi-Stri. (Vihar-Bhoomi) means a place for self-study, a place for self-study, a place for play, a garden, etc."

Therefore, it is proven from the above statement that for the protection of *Vinaya*, a disciple should never criticize before the Guru while going to the *Vihar-Bhoomi* or *Vichar-Bhoomi* with the Guru.

## The Third Chapter

**With Hindi Commentary**

Now the Sutrakar describes the expectations of conduct:

**If someone is worthy of conversing with the Ratnakar, and the disciple converses with them before the Ratnakar, then the disciple experiences Ashatana.** (12)

**Word by Word:**

* **Kei** - someone
* **Rayaniyassa** - of the Ratnakar
* **Puvva-sanlavittae** - worthy of conversing with
* **Sia** - is
* **Tam** - with them
* **Sehe** - the disciple
* **Puvva-taragam** - before the Ratnakar
* **Alavayi** - converses
* **Paccha** - afterwards
* **Rayanie** - the Ratnakar
* **Bhavayi** - becomes
* **Asayana** - Ashatana
* **Sehassa** - of the disciple

**Meaning:**

If someone is worthy of conversing with the Ratnakar, and the disciple converses with them before the Ratnakar, then the disciple experiences Ashatana.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra describes the proper conduct regarding speech. For example, if someone who is familiar with the Ratnakar comes to meet them, and they ask the Ratnakar about their well-being, and the disciple begins to converse with them before the Ratnakar has responded, then the disciple experiences Ashatana. This is because it reveals the disciple's lack of decorum, rudeness, and unworthiness.

The Tirthankaras and Ganadharas have instructed that all actions should be performed by the Ratnakar first. With their permission, the disciple can perform actions like conversing, etc., even before the Ratnakar, but never without their permission.

The word "Kachit" refers to a hypocrite, a householder, a woman or a man, a supporter or an opponent, a Sadhu or an Upasaka.

The implication is that it is completely inappropriate and against decorum for a disciple to converse with anyone who is worthy of conversing with the Ratnakar before the Ratnakar or the Guru. If they do so, they will experience Ashatana.

## English Translation:

**70**
**Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra**

This question may arise: If the individual is an acquaintance of the disciple and engages in conversation with him, what should be done at that time? In response, it can be said that even at that time, the disciple should engage in conversation with him only with the Guru's permission; because by doing so, that individual will also become acquainted with the disciple's humility, civility, and competence.

**Third Dasha**

Now the Sutrakar describes the expectation of not receiving the words:

**Meaning:**
* The Ratnakar called out to the disciple in the night or at an inappropriate time, saying, "O Aryas! Who is sleeping and who is awake?" There, even though the disciple was awake, if he did not listen to the Ratnakar's words, then the disciple would have an expectation.

**Commentary:**
* This Sutra explains that if the disciple remains silent when called by the Guru, he will have an expectation. For example, if the Ratnakar or Guru called out to the Sadhus in the night or at an inappropriate time, saying, "O Aryas! Which Sadhu is sleeping and which is awake?" If a disciple was awake at that time and thought to himself, "If I...

## Not the Third Stage
**With Hindi Commentary**

If I were to respond to this, Guruji might assign me a task, so it's better to remain silent. And if I truly take refuge in silence, it might seem like I'm being disrespectful to the teacher, as it could be interpreted as dishonesty, disrespect, and disregard for the Guru's words, among other faults. Additionally, if there is an urgent need, like a student falling ill with a fever, a fire breaking out, a drunk, adulterous, or thieving person entering the premises, or a special task like a *Parshva Udvartana* arises, then not going when the Guru calls could lead to great harm.

If someone unknown, like a *Ratnakar*, calls with the intention of causing trouble, then it is better not to go. In such a situation, disobeying the call would not lead to any disrespect towards the teacher.

Having discussed the disrespect related to words, the author now speaks of disrespect related to food:

**"If a student takes food, water, edibles, or delicacies from a householder, and then discusses them first with other students and later with the Guru, it leads to disrespect."**

**Word by Word Meaning:**

* **Sehe:** Student
* **Asana:** Food
* **Wa:** Or
* **Paana:** Water
* **Wa:** Or
* **Khaima:** Edibles
* **Wa:** Or
* **Saim:** Delicacies
* **Wa:** Or
* **Tan:** Those
* **Padigahitta:** Taking
* **Puvvamaeva:** First
* **Seha:** Student
* **Taragassa:** To
* **Aaloei:** Discusses
* **Paccha:** Later
* **Rayaniyassa:** To the Ratnakar
* **Seha:** Student
* **Asayana:** Disrespect

**Meaning:**

If a student takes food, water, edibles, or delicacies from a householder and discusses them first with other students and then with the Guru, it leads to disrespect.

## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Third Dasha

- **Commentary:** This Sutra discusses criticism related to food. For example, if a Sadhu collects all four types of food suitable for a Sadhu-kalpa from householders and brings it to his Ashram, and then starts criticizing the food - "I got this particular item from this particular place, this particular householder gave me this type of alms" etc. - before the Guru, it is considered Ashasana (a cause for blame). This is because it leads to a breach of discipline and fosters self-will. Therefore, it is proven that the criticism of the items collected through alms should be done first with the Ratnakar. However, remember that this criticism should be done before consuming the food etc.

The next Sutra also explains the same topic:

**Sehe asanam va panam va khaim va saim va padigahitta tam puvva meva sehataragassa uvadansehi paccha rayaniyassa asayana sehas. ||15||**

**Shaiksho ashanam va panam va khadim va svadim va prati grihya tat purva meva shaikshatarakasya upadarshayati pachad ratnikasya ashatana shaikshasya. ||15||**

**Word by word meaning:** Sehe - disciple, asanam - food, va - or, panam - water, va - or, khaim - edible, va - or, saim - tasty, padigahitta - taking, tam - that food, puvva meva - first, sehataragassa - to any disciple, uvadansehi - shows, paccha - later, rayaniyassa - to the Ratnakar, asayana - blame, sehas - to the disciple. 'Va' word is used for choice or group meaning.

**Meaning:** If a disciple takes food, water, edible and tasty items and shows them to another disciple before the Guru, it leads to blame for the disciple.

**Commentary:** This Sutra highlights that a disciple should first show the food, water, edible and tasty items collected from householders to the Guru. If he shows it to another disciple before the Guru, it leads to blame. This is because it breaks discipline. Also, by doing so, neither the Guru's Guru-tva (status of a Guru) nor the disciple's Shishya-tva (status of a disciple) can remain. The essence of this statement is that after bringing the food etc., one should...

## The Third Chapter

### With Hindi Commentary

**73**

First, show it to the Guru, and then to others. Only by doing this can one properly follow the rules of civility and humility.

In some copies, the word "Uvadanse" is replaced with "Padidanse", which means "to show again and again".

Now the author of the sutras speaks about the expectation of food invitation:

**Sehe Asanam Va Panam Va Khaim Va Saim Va Padigahitta Tam Puvva Mev Sehatarag Uvanimantei Paccha Rayanie Asayana Sehass.** || 16 ||

**Shaiksho'shanam Va Panam Va Khadim Va Svadim Va Prati Grihya Tat Purva Ev Shaikshatarakam Upanimantrayati Paschad Ratnikasya Ashatana Shaikshasya.** || 16 ||

**Word by Word Meaning:** Sehe - disciple, Asanam - food, Va - or, Panam - water, Va - or, Khaim - edible, Va - or, Saim - palatable, Padigahitta - taking, Tam - that food, Puvva Mev - first, Sehatarag - disciple, Uvanimantei - invites, Paccha - after, Rayanie - Ratnakara, Asayana - expectation, Sehass - disciple.

**Meaning:** When the disciple brings food, water, edible and palatable things back to the ashram, if he invites the disciple first and the Guru later, then the disciple (who invited the Guru later) will have an expectation.

**Commentary:** This highlights that when the disciple brings food back to the ashram, it is appropriate for him to first invite Ratnakara. If he invites another disciple before Ratnakara, then he will have an expectation, because breaking the order inevitably leads to breaking humility. Therefore, after offering the appropriate portion to Ratnakara or the Guru, only then should the disciple give his portion to other disciples. And it is also appropriate for the disciples to share the remaining portion of the food with the virtuous, with love, to increase mutual love.

##  74
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Third Dasha

Therefore, it is proven that for the observance of Vinaya-Dharma, whatever is received through alms, the Guru or Ratnakara should be invited first.

Now the Sutrakar describes the desire for food:

**Sehe Raayanieṇ Saddhiṁ Asanṁ vā Paṇṁ vā Khaahimṁ vā Saahimṁ vā Paḍigaahittaṁ Taṁ Raayaniyam Aṇāpuccittaṁ Jass Jass Icchhai Tass Tass Khaḍṁ Khaḍṁ Taṁ Dalayati Aasaayaṇā Sehass. ||17||**

**Shaiksho Ratniken Sardham Asanam va Panam va Khadim va Swadim va Prati Grihya Tad-Ratnikam Anaprchhya Yasmai-Yasmai Ichchati Tasmai-Tasmai Prachuram-Prachuram Dadatyashaatana Shaikshasya. ||17||**

_Paddarthanvaya- Sehe- disciple Raayanieṇ- Ratnakara ke Saddhiṁ- with Asanṁ- food vā- or Paṇṁ- water vā- or Khaahimṁ- Khadim vā- or Saahimṁ- Swadim ko vā- or other equipment Paḍigaahittaṁ- taking came to the shelter and then Taṁ- that food Raayaniyam- Ratnakara ko Aṇāpuccittaṁ- without asking Jass Jass- whom whom Icchhai- wants Tass Tass- that that Khaḍṁ Khaḍṁ- abundant Taṁ- that food etc. Dalayati- gives then Sehass- disciple ko Aasaayaṇā- desire for food._

**Mulaarth- The disciple comes to the shelter with food, water, Khadim and Swadim along with the Ratnakara and without asking the Ratnakara, if he gives abundant food to whomever he wants, then he (the disciple) feels a desire for food.**

**Teeka- This Sutra highlights that when the disciple comes to the shelter with food, water, Khadim and Swadim, it is appropriate for him not to give anything to anyone without the Ratnakara's permission. If he gives as much as he wants to whomever he wants, then he feels a desire for food. However, if someone is sick or an ascetic in need, then there is no desire for food in giving to them, because there is protection and merit in that.**

Page #143:
---------------------------
## Third Chapter
## With Hindi Commentary

**755**

The essence is that, except for the exceptional path, one should not give any food or other substances to Ratnakar without asking and without obtaining his permission, while following the path of renunciation.

Now, the sutra-kar (author of the sutra) describes the desire for food in a disciple:

**"Sehe asanam va...padigahita rayaniyenam sadhim bhujamanne tatha sehe khadham khadham, dagam dagam, ushadham ushadham, rasiyam rasiyam, manunnam manunnam, manamam manamam, nidham nidham, lukham lukham, aharitta bhavai asayana sehas."** ||18||

**"Shaiksho asanam va...prati grihya ratnikenam sardham bhujanasta tatra shaiksha prachuram-prachuram, dak-dakam, uchchritam uchchritam, rasitam-rasitam, manojna-manojna, man-apta-man-apta, snigdham-snigdham, rukha-rukhamaharayita bhavatya ashatana shaikshasya."** ||18||

**Word by word meaning:**

* Sehe - disciple, asanam va - food, water, edible, palatable, padigahita - taking, rayaniyenam - Ratnakar, sadhim - with, bhujamanne - enjoying, tatha - there, sehe - disciple, khadham khadham - abundant, dagam dagam - sour-tasting (various types of vegetables), ushadham ushadham - with color and taste, rasiyam rasiyam - tasty, manunnam manunnam - palatable food, manamam manamam - food pleasing to the mind, nidham nidham - oily food, lukham lukham - dry, aharitta - eating, bhavai - becomes, asayana - desire for food, sehas - disciple.

**Meaning:**

If the disciple, while taking food with Ratnakar, starts eating abundant, sour-tasting (various types of vegetables), tasty, palatable, pleasing to the mind, oily or dry food quickly, then he develops a desire for food.

**Commentary:**

This sutra explains that if a disciple ever gets the opportunity to eat with Ratnakar in the same vessel, then how should he eat.

Page #144:
---------------------------
##  Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra, Third Dasha

**How does a disciple incur *Aashaatana* (negative karma) while eating?**

For example, a disciple returns to the *upaashraya* (monastery) after collecting alms. Due to some reason, he has to share the same bowl with the *Ratnaakar* (senior monk). While eating, if the disciple takes large bites, eats quickly, or picks out and eats quickly the delicious, attractive, pleasing, desirable, ghee-infused, or flavorful dry foods (like papad), then he incurs *Aashaatana*. Therefore, one should never do this. This increases the desire for taste (craving for delicious food) and also leads to a loss of humility.

Alternatively, even if they don't share the same bowl, but the disciple separates the food he likes from the alms and gives the rest to the *Ratnaakar*, he still incurs *Aashaatana*. If the disciple considers all the food he brought as suitable for himself, gives a small portion to the *Ratnaakar*, and keeps the rest for himself, he will also incur *Aashaatana*.

The phrase "**डाकं डाकं**" (Daakaa Daakaa) is used twice in the sutra, signifying emphasis.

The word "**डाक**" (Daak) refers to the collection of leafy greens (like spinach) in a bowl. The word "**उसढ**" (Usadha) refers to food with flavor and aroma. The word "**रसित**" (Rasit) refers to sweet and delicious food containing juices like amla (gooseberry). Food that is pleasing or desirable to the mind is called "**मनोज्ञ**" (Manojnya). "**मणाम**" (Manaam) refers to food that is desired repeatedly, never leaves the memory, and always pleases the mind. If one eats these foods quickly, the disciple incurs *Aashaatana*.

While eating, one should always remember that food is for the sustenance of the *sanayma-vrutti* (practice of self-restraint), not for the gratification of the tongue or to enhance the beauty of the body.

Now, the sutra describes *Aashaatana* related to the words of the sutrakar (author):

**"सेहे रायणियस्स वाहरमाणस्स अपडिसुणित्ता भवइ आसायणा सेहस्स ।।१६।।"**

(If one does not listen to the words of the *Rayani* (teacher) while eating, he incurs *Aashaatana*.)

Page #145:
---------------------------
## Third Chapter
## With Hindi Commentary

**77**

**The student who does not respond to the Ratnakara's call, experiences Ashatana.** (16)

**Word-by-word meaning:** Sehe - student, Rayaniyassa - of the Ratnakara, Vahaaramanassa - being called, Apadisunitta - not listening to the words, Sehasse - student, Asayana - Ashatana, Bhavai - happens.

**Meaning:** If the student does not listen attentively when the Ratnakara calls him, he experiences Ashatana.

**Commentary:** This sutra states that if the Ratnakara calls a student and he does not listen attentively, he experiences Ashatana. For example, if the Ratnakara calls a student for some reason, the student might think to himself, "If I don't respond, the Guru will think I couldn't hear because of the noise, and at night, he will think I am asleep. Therefore, it is better to remain silent." If he then actually remains silent, he will experience Ashatana.

This proves that one should never engage in such deceitful actions, but always follow the Guru's instructions with joy.

The next sutra, the sutrakar speaks about the same Ashatana:

**The student who sits there and listens to the Ratnakara's call, experiences Ashatana.** (20)

**Word-by-word meaning:** Sehe - student, Rayaniyassa - of the Ratnakara, Vahaaramanassa - being called, Tattha Gaye Cheva - sitting there, Padisunitta - listening to the words, Sehasse - student, Asayana - Ashatana, Bhavai - happens.

**Meaning:** If the student sits in his place and listens to the Ratnakara's words when he is called, he experiences Ashatana.

## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Third Dasha
## Commentary:
This Sutra states that when a Guru invites a disciple, it is appropriate for the disciple to rise from their seat and go to the Guru, listening attentively and respectfully to their instructions. They should not remain seated out of fear of the task, as this will lead to Ashatana (a state of disrespect). However, there may be exceptions if there is a specific reason, but this reason must be communicated to the Guru, otherwise, Ashatana cannot be avoided.

The Vrittikar (commentator) also wrote: "If one is engaged in physical activity, holding a vessel, or eating, and does not respond, there is no fault."

Now, the Sutrakar (author of the Sutra) describes the Ashatana related to the above:

**"Sehe Rayaniyassa Kimti Vatta Bhavai Asayana Sehass" (21)**
**"Shaiksho Ratnikasya "Kimiti" Vakta Bhavatya Ashatana Shaiksyasya" (21)**

**Word by Word Meaning:**
Sehe - disciple, Rayaniyassa - of the Ratnakar (Guru), Kimti Vatta - "What do you say?" if said, Sehass - to the disciple, Asayana - Ashatana, Bhavai - happens.

**Meaning:**
If a disciple says "What do you say?" when called by the Ratnakar (Guru), it leads to Ashatana.

## Commentary:
This Sutra explains that when a Guru calls a disciple, the disciple should listen to the Guru's words with devotion and humility. If they do not, it leads to Ashatana. For example, if a Guru calls a disciple at some point, the disciple should never say "What do you say?" or "What does he say?" with inattentiveness. This is because such speech, on the one hand, breaks humility, and on the other hand, reveals the speaker's incompetence and rudeness. Therefore, when called, one should go to the Guru with humility, listen attentively to their words, and follow their instructions appropriately. This is the path to merit.

Now, the Sutrakar again describes the Ashatana related to the above:

**"Sehe Rayaniyam Tumanti Vatta Bhavai Asayana Sehass" (22)**
**"Shaiksho Ratnikam "Twam" iti Vakta Bhavatya Ashatana Shaiksyasya" (22)**

Page #147:
---------------------------
## Third Chapter

**With Hindi Commentary**

**Word-by-word meaning:** 
* **Sehe** - disciple, **Rayaniyam** - Ratnakar, **Tumanti "Tu"** - saying "you", **Vatta** - calling, **Sehass** - disciple, **Asayana** - anxiety, **Bhavai** - becomes.

**Meaning:** 
* If a disciple calls Ratnakar "you", then the disciple experiences anxiety.

**Commentary:** 
* This sutra states that when a disciple addresses Ratnakar or the Guru, they should use the plural form. This is because one should always show respect to their elders, and respect is always conveyed through the use of the plural form. If a disciple addresses the Guru in the singular form, then they experience anxiety.
* Therefore, one should never use disrespectful phrases like "Who are you to give me guidance?" when addressing the Guru. Instead, they should address them with respectful and humble words.

**The sutra author then describes another type of anxiety:**

**Word-by-word meaning:** 
* **Sehe** - disciple, **Rayaniyam** - Ratnakar, **Khaddam Khaddam** - with harsh and excessive words, **Vatta** - calling, **Sehass** - disciple, **Asayana** - anxiety, **Bhavai** - becomes.

**Meaning:** 
* If a disciple addresses Ratnakar with harsh and excessive words, then the disciple experiences anxiety.

**Commentary:** 
* This sutra states that if a disciple wishes to address Ratnakar, they should do so with respect, using gentle and appropriate words. If they address him with arrogance, using harsh and excessive words, then they experience anxiety.

Page #148:
---------------------------
## The Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra, Third Dasha

The phrase "khaddam khaddam" in the Sutra means: "Speaking with a very harsh, loud voice, excessively, to a Ratnik." In other words, addressing a Ratnik with extremely harsh words and in a loud voice, exceeding the appropriate measure.

The "Samavayaanga Sutra" also clarifies its meaning, stating: "Speaking to Ratnakara, or in his presence, with loud words, repeatedly." This means speaking to Ratnakara with big words and excessively.

Therefore, it is proven that Ratnakara should be addressed with respectful and loving words.

Now, the Sutrakar again describes the nature of Ashatana (disrespect):

**"Sehe Rayaniyam Tajjaayena Tajjaayena Padihanitta Bhavai Asayana Sehass." (24)**

**"Shaiksho Ratnikam Tajjaate-Tajjaate Pratihanta (Pratibhashita) Bhavatyaashatana Shaikshasya." (24)**

**Word-by-word meaning:**

* Sehe - Disciple
* Rayaniyam - Ratnakara
* Tajjaayena - With his words
* Padihanitta - Responds (answers)
* Bhavai - Becomes
* Asayana - Ashatana
* Sehass - Disciple

**Meaning:**

If the disciple disrespects Ratnakara by contradicting his words, then the disciple experiences Ashatana.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra states that whatever the Guru teaches the disciple, the disciple should accept it with respect. However, the disciple should not disrespect the Guru's words. For example, if the Guru teaches that every Sadhu should serve the Glan (tired or sorrowful person) and never be lazy, and the disciple asks, "Guruji Maharaj! Why don't you serve the Glan yourself? Why are you lazy?" or "Why don't you do Swadhyaya yourself?" then the disciple experiences Ashatana.

The word "Tajjaate" in the Sutra means to argue against the Guru's words to disrespect him, leading to his ridicule.

Page #149:
---------------------------
## The Third Chapter

**With Hindi Commentary**

Now the Sutrakar (author of the sutras) describes the nature of Asatana (arrogance) in the same context:

**Sutra 25:**

*Sehe Rayaniyassa Kahan Kahemanas iti Evam Vatta Bhavai Asayana Sehass.*

**Translation:**

If a student (Sehe) while the teacher (Rayaniyassa) is narrating a story (Kahan Kahemanas) says, "It should be said like this" (iti Evam Vatta), then that student experiences Asatana (Asayana).

**Word by Word Meaning:**

* Sehe - student
* Rayaniyassa - of the teacher (Ratnakar)
* Kahan - story
* Kahemanas - narrating
* iti - thus
* Evam - like this
* Vatta - says
* Bhavai - becomes
* Asayana - Asatana
* Sehass - of the student

**Meaning:**

If a student interrupts the teacher while he is narrating a story and says, "You should say it like this," then the student experiences Asatana.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra states that if a teacher is briefly explaining the nature of something while narrating a story, and the student interrupts saying, "You should explain it this way, because this is the true nature of the thing, as I understand it," then the student experiences Asatana. This is because the student's intention is not to learn but to show off their intelligence. It should be understood that other similar actions can also lead to Asatana.

Therefore, a student should avoid any action that might disrespect the teacher. Instead, they should always remain humble and respectful towards the teacher.

**Sutra 26:**

*Sehe Rayaniyassa Kahan Kahemanas No Sumarasi iti Vatta Bhavai Asayana Sehass.*

**Translation:**

If a student (Sehe) while the teacher (Rayaniyassa) is narrating a story (Kahan Kahemanas) says, "You don't remember it properly" (No Sumarasi iti Vatta), then that student experiences Asatana (Asayana).

Page #150:

## 82
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Third Dasha 5

The teacher is telling the story of Ratnakara. The speaker says, "Don't you remember?" This is a sign of the teacher's arrogance. 26.

**Word by Word Meaning:**
- Sehe - student, Ratnayaniya - Ratnakara, ke - of, kahm - story, kahemaanass - telling, kahe hue - while telling, no sumarsi - you forget, you don't remember, iti - thus, vattha - said, to sehas - thousand, shishya - students, ko - to, ashatana - arrogance, bhava - becomes.

**Main Meaning:**
- When the student Ratnakara is telling a story and the teacher says, "You forget, you don't remember," this creates arrogance in the student.

**Commentary:**
- This sutra explains that if Ratnakara or the Guru is telling a story and the student interrupts by saying that the Guru has forgotten the subject, and then starts describing the subject themselves, it creates arrogance in the student. This is because the student is trying to show their superiority over the Guru, which leads to a lack of humility and hinders the attainment of true knowledge. Therefore, one should never disrespect the Guru in this way.

- The question arises: What should the student do if Ratnakara is describing inappropriate and unfavorable things in the assembly? The answer is that in such a situation, the student should act with decorum, considering the context, time, and emotions. If the student is certain that the Guru's words are spreading falsehood and causing harm to the faith of many people, then it is appropriate for the student to act according to the following political principle.

- As stated in the political treatise (Neeti Vakya Amrit), if the king is engaged in a conversation, it is not appropriate for the ministers to interrupt. However, if the king's conversation is leading to the destruction of the kingdom, or if there is a possibility of unrest among the people or an attack by a powerful king, then the ministers should speak up at the appropriate time. The author of the treatise has explained this with an example: "If a child does not drink milk, does the mother not slap its cheeks?" This means that the mother will definitely slap the child. Similarly, the student should act according to the situation.

Page #151:
---------------------------
## The Third Chapter

**With Hindi Commentary**

**For the benefit of all.** Following this principle, even if a disciple opposes the Guru, there is no fault if it is done with the right intention and at the right time.

**83**

However, remember that this should only be done for the protection of Dharma, not otherwise. If someone does this out of malice towards the Ratnakar, they will surely face Ashasana (negative consequences).

Now, the Sutrakar explains the Ashasana related to this topic:

**Sehe Raayaniyassa Kahan Kahemaanassa No Sumanaase Bhavai Aasaayana Sehass. || 27 ||**

**Shaiksho Raatnikasya Katham Kathayato No Sumana Bhavatyaashasana Shaikshasya. || 27 ||**

**Word by Word Meaning:** Sehe - disciple, Raayaniyassa - of the Ratnakar, Kahan Kahemaanassa - while speaking, No Sumanaase - instead of being happy, becomes unhappy (does not listen with an open mind), then Aasaayana - Ashasana, Bhavai - happens.

**Meaning:** If a disciple becomes unhappy while the Ratnakar is speaking, then Ashasana will befall him.

**Commentary:** This Sutra states that a disciple should always be happy while listening to the Guru's words. Because the Guru's words are a treasure trove of invaluable teachings and are always helpful in purifying life. The implication is that one should listen to the Guru's words with an open mind and joy, and never be overcome by sleep or laziness while the Guru is speaking, nor should one ever mock them in any way.

If a disciple, while the Ratnakar is speaking, becomes overcome by sleep and laziness, expresses unhappiness, feels distressed, mocks the Guru's words in any way, or tries to find fault with the Guru's words with pointless arguments, they will surely face Ashasana.

Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
Third Dasha

Therefore, to avoid Ashatana, the disciple should never perform the actions mentioned above. Only then can Guru-bhakti remain and Vinaya-dharma be followed.

Now the Sutrakar describes Ashatana related to the above topic:

"Sehe Rayaniyassa Kahan Kahemanas Parisan Bhettaa Bhavai Asayana Sehass." ||28||
"Shaiksho Ratnikasya Katham Kathayatah Parisadbhatta Bhavatya Ashatana Shaiksyasya." ||28||

Padyarth Anvaya: Sehe - disciple, Rayaniyassa - of Ratnakara, Kahan - story, Kahemanas - telling, Parisan - assembly (of listeners), Bhettaa - breaking, Bhavai - becomes, Sehass - disciple, Asayana - Ashatana.

Mulaarth: If the disciple breaks the assembly while Ratnakara is telling a story, then he will experience Ashatana.

Teeka: This Sutra describes that if Ratnakara is delivering a Dharma-katha somewhere, and the people are peacefully listening to the story, being influenced by the Dharma-prachar, then one should never try to break the assembly. If a disciple says, "It's time for Bhiksha, the story should end," or "You are so fond of the story, other Sadhus are suffering from hunger," etc., and creates an obstacle, causing the listeners to leave, then the disciple will experience Ashatana. As a result, those who were supposed to benefit from the story will be deprived of it. This behavior of the Guru and disciple will lead to ridicule from the people, disrespect for Vinaya-dharma, fear of loss in knowledge, vision, and character, and the emergence of self-contradiction and restraint-contradiction, leading to the soul being trapped in the bondage of karma like Jnanavaraniya, etc. Therefore, one should never break the assembly.

Page #153:
---------------------------
## The Third Chapter

**With Hindi Commentary**

Now the Sutrakar again describes the nature of Asatana related to the same subject: "If a disciple, while the Ratnakar is speaking, interrupts the discourse, then Asatana arises for the disciple." (26)

**Commentary:** If the Ratnakar is speaking and the disciple, by creating some obstacle, changes the mental state of the listeners, then Asatana arises for the disciple. For example, if the Ratnakar is delivering a Dharma discourse and the listeners are attentively listening, and the disciple comes in between and says, "Get up! It's time for alms, not for listening to this discourse. Do your own work, the discourse will continue later," or makes some other irrelevant statement, thus disrupting the discourse, and when the Guru or Ratnakar's assembled audience starts to leave, he himself begins to speak, or creates a commotion like donkeys, buffaloes, etc., in the middle of the discourse, or creates any other reason for the discourse to be interrupted, then Asatana arises for the disciple.

The meaning of all this is that one should never try to interrupt the discourse, because it can create a feeling of aversion towards Dharma in the minds of the people.

Now the Sutrakar again describes the nature of Asatana related to the same subject: "If a disciple, while the Ratnakar is speaking, interrupts the discourse, which is uninterrupted, unhindered, and free from any defect, then Asatana arises for the disciple." (30)

## Third Dasha

-
The story of the Shaiksha and the Ratnakara is being told. In that assembly, before it rises, before it becomes different, before it is broken, before it scatters, the Shaiksha, out of desire for praise, will tell the same story again, a second time, a third time. ||30||

_Word by word meaning- Sehe- disciple Ratnayaniya- Ratnakara ke kahe- story kahemaanass- telling, tise- that parisaye- assembly ke anuttiyae- rising before, abhinnae- different before, avuccchhinnae- broken before, avvogadae- scattered before, tamev- that same story ko docchamp- twice, tacchamp- thrice, vistar- fully kahi- telling, to sehass- disciple ko asayana- ashatana bhava- becomes._

_Original meaning- While the disciple Ratnakara is telling the story, if the assembly that has gathered rises, becomes different, breaks, and scatters, and the disciple tells the same story again, twice or thrice, then the disciple experiences ashatana._

_Commentary- This sutra explains that the disciple should not waste their talent. For example, if the disciple, in the assembly where Ratnakara is telling the story, starts telling the same story again, twice or thrice, before the assembly rises, becomes different, and scatters, then the disciple experiences ashatana. This is because such an action can only be motivated by a desire to belittle Ratnakara and praise their own talent. In other words, they want to show the people that the disciple is more talented than the guru. However, if the disciple repeats the story two or three times just to show off their talent, then they will experience ashatana. But if the guru himself instructs them to elaborate on the story, then there will be no ashatana. This is because ashatana is related to mental feelings. If an action is done out of ego, then the disciple will experience ashatana. But if it is done with a selfless intention, then there will be no ashatana.

The conclusion of all this is that one should act in every situation only with humility and devotion to the guru, leaving behind egoistic feelings. This will make the soul worthy of praise in both worlds._

Now the Sutrakar describes the matter of conflict:

**Sehe Raayaniyass Sijjā-Santhāragam Paaenaṁ Sanghattita Hatyeṇa Aṇṇuutaavitta (Aṇṇuvitta) Gacchai Āsāyanā Bhavai Sehass. ||31||**

**Shaiksho Raatnikasya Shayyaam-Sanstaarakam Paadena Sanghaty Haste-Naananuutapya (Ananujaanya) Gacchatyāshātana Bhavati Shaikshasya ||31||**

**Word Meaning:** Sehe - disciple, Raayaniyass - Ratnakar, Sijjā - bed, Santhāragam - bedding, Paaenaṁ - with foot, Sanghattita - touched, Hattheṇa - without joining hands, Aṇṇuutaavitta - without accepting fault, Aṇṇuvitta - without apology, Gacchai - goes, Sehass - disciple, Āsāyanā - anxiety, Bhavai - becomes.

**Main Meaning:** If a disciple touches the bed and bedding of Ratnakar with his foot, without accepting his fault and without joining his hands to apologize, then he will experience anxiety.

**Commentary:** This Sutra explains that if a disciple touches the bed and bedding of his Guru with his foot without any reason, then what should he do. For example, if a disciple accidentally touches the bed and bedding of his Guru with his foot, then it is appropriate for him to join his hands and apologize to his Guru, saying, "Oh Lord! Please forgive my mistake. I will not repeat this mistake in the future." If he leaves without apologizing, then he will experience anxiety due to his lack of humility, and those who see him will lose respect for him. Additionally, there is a fear that other nearby Sadhus will also become disrespectful by imitating his behavior.

A disciple should always be mindful of protecting the importance of his Guru or Ratnakar. If he disrespects his Guru in any way, then the Dharma teachings he receives from his Guru will never be successful. Therefore, one should never disrespect the importance of one's Guru.

Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
Third Dasha
This question may arise: what is the difference between a bed (shayya) and a mattress (sanstarak)? The answer is that a bed is for the whole body, and a mattress is only two and a half hands long. Or, what is laid on bare ground is called a bed, and what is laid on a wooden platform (takht) is called a mattress. Or (shayya eva sanstarak: - shayya-sanstarak: , shayya yaan va sanstarak: - shayya-sanstarak: tam” etc.).
The conclusion is that if a disciple touches the feet of any of the Guru's equipment without his permission, whether it is used or not, he should definitely apologize for it.
Now the sutrakar describes the ashatana that arises from doing other actions on the Guru's seat:
Sehe Rayaniyassa sijja-santhare chittitta va niseeitta va tuyattita va bhava asayana sehas. ||32||
Shaiksho ratnikasya shayya-sanstarake sthata va niseedita va twagvartita va bhavatyaashatana shaikshasya. ||32||
Padarthanvaya: - Sehe - disciple Rayaniyassa - Ratnakar's sijja - bed and santhare - mattress above chittitta - standing or niseeitta - sitting or tuyattita - sleeping or lying down and turning to the side, then sehas - disciple asayana - ashatana bhava - happens.
Mulaarth - If the disciple stands, sits or sleeps on Ratnakar's bed-mattress, he feels ashatana.
Tika - This sutra states that the disciple should not stand, sit or sleep on the bed without Ratnakar's permission, because doing so would be a violation of decorum, and secondly, it would make people aware of his (the disciple's) rudeness. And the respect for both the Guru and the disciple would be lost from the hearts of the people, and both religion and the individual would be diminished.

##  The Third Stage

**With Hindi Commentary**

**86**

Therefore, one should never sit, stand, etc. on the bed, seat, etc. of the Ratnakara without obtaining his permission. However, if one sits on his seat to perform service (Vyayavritti) due to his illness, etc., with his permission, then there is no Ashatana. Therefore, one should perform self-welfare while being devoted to the Guru.

Now the Sutrakar again describes the Ashatana of the same subject:

**33**

**Sehe Rayaniyassa Ucchaasanansi Va Samaasanansi Va Chitthitta Va Nisiitta Va Tuyattita Va Bhavai Asayana Sehass. ||33||**

**Shaiksho Ratnikasyo Ucchaasane Va Samaasane Va Staata Va Nisiidita Va Tvagvartita Va Bhavatyaashatana Shaikshasya. ||33||**

**Paddarthanvaya:** Sehe - disciple, Rayaniyassa - of the Ratnakara, Ucchaasanansi - on a high seat, Va - or, Samaasanansi - on an equal seat, Chitthitta Va - standing, or, Nisiitta - sitting, Va - or, Tuyattita - lying down, Va - or, Sehass - disciple, Asayana - Ashatana, Bhavai - becomes.

**Mulaartha:** If the disciple stands, sits, or lies down on a seat higher than the Guru or on an equal seat, then he experiences Ashatana.

**Teeka:** This Sutra states that the disciple should never take a seat higher than the Guru or an equal seat, because it leads to a breach of humility and an increase in self-will. It also poses a threat to the humility of other disciples, as faults spread faster than virtues. Therefore, the disciple should not engage in any act that reveals his lack of humility.

It is forbidden to sit, etc. on a seat higher than the Guru or an equal seat, but there is no fault in sitting on a higher or equal seat with the Guru's permission in accordance with the time, if there is a special reason like illness, etc. This is the exception.

---------------------------
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra, Third Dasha

The **Utsarga-Marg** is the general path, while the **Apavad-Marg** is the deviation from the **Utsarga-Marg** due to specific circumstances. However, to deviate from the **Utsarga-Marg**, one must seek the permission of the **Shree Bhagwan** and the **Guru**.

In essence, to become **vineet** (humble), one must abandon **Ashatanas** (desires). **Ashatanas** naturally lead to **Atma-viraadhana** (self-defeat) and **Sanayam-viraadhana** (defeat of self-control). Therefore, those who seek their own well-being should completely abandon them. Additionally, indulging in **Ashatanas** diminishes one's **maan** (respect).

Now, the Sutrakar concludes this Dasha by saying:

"These are the thirty-three **Ashatanas** declared by the **Theris** (elders) and **Bhagwans** (divine beings). Thus, the third Dasha is complete."

**Word-by-word meaning:**

* **Eyaao** - These
* **Tao** - They
* **Therihin** - Elders
* **Bhagwantein** - Divine beings
* **Teettisam** - Thirty-three
* **Asayanaao** - Ashatanas
* **Pannattaao** - Declared
* **Tibemi** - Thus
* **Taiya** - Third
* **Dasa** - Dasha
* **Samatta** - Complete

**Original meaning:**

The **Theris** and **Bhagwans** have declared these aforementioned thirty-three **Ashatanas**. Thus, I say.

**Commentary:**

In this Sutra, the Sutrakar concludes the third Dasha by stating that these thirty-three **Ashatanas** were declared by the **Theris** and **Bhagwans**.

In the previous Sutra of this study, it was mentioned that the **Theris** and **Bhagwans** had declared thirty-three **Ashatanas**. The disciple then asked which thirty-three **Ashatanas** were declared by the **Theris** and **Bhagwans**. The Guru responded with "**Etaaha Khulu**" and so on.

Page #159:
---------------------------
## The Third Stage
**With Hindi Commentary**

"I say this" - until this point, the detailed description of the *āśātanās* was explained to the disciple.

**61**
Here, it is necessary to say that after knowing the *āśātanās*, they can also be rejected through rejection, because it is well known that only after knowing can one understand the objects that are *heya* (to be abandoned), *jñeya* (to be known), and *upādeya* (to be adopted). Therefore, one should abandon these *āśātanās* after knowing their consequences well.

In this way, Shri Sudharma Swami Ji says to his disciple Shri Jambu Swami, "O Jambu Swami! Just as I have heard the meaning of this stage from the Shraman Bhagwan Shri Mahavira Swami, in the same way, I have explained it to you, but I have not said anything from my own intellect."

Page #160:
---------------------------
## The Fourth Stage

The thirty-three *āśātanās* were described in the third stage. Now, the Sutra-kāra describes the subject of *ācāra-sampat* in this fourth stage. In the first stage, the twenty *asamādhi-sthānas* were described, in the second stage, the twenty-one *śabala-doṣas*, and in the third stage, the thirty-three *āśātanās* were described. By abandoning all these, the disciple becomes eligible for the position of *gaṇi*. In this fourth stage, the *śāstra-kāra* describes the subject of *gaṇi-sampat*, relating it to the previous three stages.

The question arises: what is *gaṇi-sampat*? The answer is that it is formed by the combination of the two words *gaṇi* and *sampat*. Of these, *gaṇi* is derived from the word *gaṇa*. A group of *sādhu*s or qualities like knowledge, etc., is called a *gaṇa*, and the leader of that *gaṇa* is called a *gaṇi*. The wealth of the *gaṇi*, both in terms of material possessions and qualities, is called *gaṇi-sampat*. In other words, the *gaṇi*’s *lakṣmī* (divine and unparalleled power) is called *gaṇi-sampat*.

Although *gaṇi-sampat* is described as being of eight types, the *gaṇi* must possess two main qualities: *saṅgraha* (collection) and *upgraha* (support). Collecting clothes, utensils, etc., and supporting disciples, etc., with clothes, utensils, and knowledge, etc., are the two main qualities. When these two qualities are present, the rest of the qualities can arise naturally. The *gaṇi* must be complete in qualities, because without them, he cannot protect the *gaṇa*, and protecting the *gaṇa* is his main duty.

Page #161:

-
This is the Fourth Dasha, with Hindi commentary.
"Sampat" has two divisions: "Dravya-Sampat" and "Bhava-Sampat". The group of disciples who are under his authority is the "Dravya-Sampat" of the Gani, and the collection of qualities like knowledge, etc., is called "Bhava-Sampat". Only a person who is complete with both these Sampats can truly adorn the position of "Gani".
In addition to these two divisions, there are two more divisions of "Sampat": "Kal-Sampat" and "Kshetra-Sampat". Thus, there are four divisions in total: Dravya, Bhava, Kal, and Kshetra. These four types of Sampat are considered in both the worldly and the transcendental realms.
For householders, "Dravya-Sampat" is wealth, grain, etc., "Kshetra-Sampat" is a vast area, etc., "Kal-Sampat" is the favorable time, and "Bhava-Sampat" is the possession of qualities like knowledge, etc. Similarly, one should also know about transcendental Sampat.
This statement proves that if the Gani is complete with qualities like knowledge, etc., then he can protect the Gan well, attain Nirvana himself, and also make other souls worthy of Nirvana.
In this Dasha, the Dravya and Bhava aspects of Gani-Sampat have been described. Now, the Sutrakar begins the Dasha with the following Sutra: _ Suyam me Ausam tena Bhagavaya evam akkhaayam iha khalu theraihi Bhagavantehi attha-viha Gani-sampaya panatta. Kayara khalu attha-viha Gani-sampaya panatta? Ima khalu atta-viha Gani-sampaya panatta; tam jaha:
Shruttam maya, Ayushman! Tena Bhagavataivam akhyatam iha khalu sthaviribhir Bhagavadbhir asta-vidha Gani-sampat prajnapta. Katara khalvasta-vidha Gani-sampat prajnapta? Iyam khalvasta-vidha Gani-sampat prajnapta. Tadyatha
Pardarthānwayah-Ausam-He Ayushman disciple! Me-I have Suyam-heard from Tena-that Bhagavaya-Bhagavan evam-thus akkhaayam-explained iha-in this way Jin-Shasan in khalu-determinative sense is theraihi-Sthavira Bhagavantehi-Bhagavantas attha-viha-eight types

Page #162:
---------------------------
## Chapter 64: Dasha-Shruta-Skandha Sutra

This chapter discusses the eight types of **Gani-Sampada-Gani-Sampat** (wealth of knowledge and wealth of conduct). The disciple asks, "What are the eight types of **Gani-Sampada-Gani-Sampat**?" The teacher replies, "These are the eight types of **Gani-Sampada-Gani-Sampat**."

**Fourth Dasha:**

**Original Text:** "O Ayushman Shiष्य! I have heard that the Bhagavan has said this. In this Jain Dharma, the elder Bhagavants have described eight types of **Gani-Sampat**. The disciple asked, "O Bhagavan! What are the eight types of **Gani-Sampat**?" The teacher replied, "These are the eight types of **Gani-Sampat**."

**Commentary:** This Sutra clarifies that the author is conveying the teachings as he heard them from the Bhagavan. This confirms the authenticity of the **Shruta-Jnana** (knowledge derived from scriptures), as it helps reveal the true nature of the soul, unlike **Mithya-Shruta** (false knowledge) which fuels wrong beliefs. Therefore, **Shruta-Jnana** is beneficial for all beings.

This Sutra also emphasizes the importance of **Aapt-Vakya** (words of the enlightened), which are the words of the **Sarvagya** (omniscient). As this Sutra is a **Sarvagya-Ukt** (statement of the omniscient), it is completely valid and authoritative. Therefore, the teachings in this Sutra are beneficial for both this world and the next.

In reality, **Atmik-Sampat** (spiritual wealth) is the true wealth of the soul, while **Dravya-Sampat** (material wealth) is temporary and perishable. **Bhav-Sampat** (wealth of conduct) remains with the soul and helps reveal its true nature.

This Dasha specifically focuses on **Bhav-Sampat**, and its first Sutra is as follows...

## Chapter 4 of the Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

**66**

This is the seventh **prayoga-sampat**, which means that one should only engage in a dispute after considering the substance, field, time, and emotion. The eighth is **sangraha-parijna-sampat**, which means that one should gather (organize) a group with wisdom. Gathering is essential in both worldly and transcendental matters, as it makes almost every task easier.

The "t" at the end of the word "sampat" becomes "y" according to the following sutra: "In words ending in a consonant, the final consonant becomes "y" after the word "vidyut" except for the word "vidyut". This is an exception to the rule of "lug". For example, "sarit" becomes "sariya", "pratipat" becomes "padivaa", and "sampat" becomes "sampaya". The "y" sound is more prominent in "sariya", "padivaa", and "sampaya" due to the rule of "bahuladhikaranadishtsprushta tara". The question is, "Is it not "vijjoo"?" (15)

In Sanskrit, the words mentioned above are both halant and ajant.

This sutra only mentions the names of the eight sampadas. Now the sutrakar explains each sampada along with its sub-categories. The first is **achar sampat**. Therefore, the next sutra discusses this topic:

"What is **achar-sampaya**? **Achar-sampaya** is of four types. These are: one who is engaged in **samyama** practices, one who is **dhruva-yoga**-bound, one who is **asampragrahi-atma** (one who does not cling to the self), and one who is **aniyat-vitti** (one who has a steady mind) and **vuddha-sheela** (one who has good character). This is **achar-sampaya**." (1)

**Word by word meaning:**

"What is **achar-sampaya**?" - The student asked, "O Bhagavan! What is **achar-sampaya**?" The guru replied, "O student! **Achar-sampaya** is of four types." "**Tadyatha** - Just as one who is engaged in **samyama** practices, one who is **dhruva-yoga**-bound, one who is **asampragrahi-atma** (one who does not cling to the self), and one who is **aniyat-vitti** (one who has a steady mind) and **vuddha-sheela** (one who has good character). This is **achar-sampaya**." (1)

The commentator of this chapter also accepts both types of words in the commentary.

Page #165:

## Fourth Dasha

**With Hindi Commentary**

**17**

In actions, the one whose yogas are firm, is the one who has the meaning of the 'ya' sound in the collective sense. The one who does not engage in **asampgahiya**, **appa**, **ahankara**, the one who wanders without **aniyat-vitti**, **apratibandha**, the one who adopts the nature of the **vudda-sile bhava**, the one who is free from fickleness in every action and possesses the quality of **gambhirya** by the words 'avi' and 'ye', this is the **achar-sampya-achar-sampat**.

**Original Meaning:** The disciple asked, "O Bhagavan! What is **achar-sampat**?" The Guru replied, "**Achar-sampat** is described as being of four types. For example: 1- Being firm in **yoga** in the actions of **samyama**. 2- Being free from **ahankara**. 3- Wandering without **apratibandha**. 4- Adopting the nature of the elders. These are the four types of **achar-sampat**."

**Commentary:** In this sutra, the Guru describes **achar-sampat** in the form of a question and answer between the Guru and the disciple. For example, the disciple asked, "O Bhagavan! What is **achar-sampat**?" The Guru replied, "O disciple! The firmness of character is called **achar-sampat**. But it has four divisions, for example: 1- Being firm in **yoga** in the actions of **samyama**, meaning that it is necessary to have stability in **yogas** in all the actions of **samyama**, because only then can these actions be followed properly. 2- Not being **ahankara** upon receiving the title of **gani** or upon the dominance of the actions of **samyama**, meaning that one should always remain humble in front of everyone, only then can **achar** remain pure, not from false pride. 3- Wandering without **apratibandha**, because only the person who wanders without **apratibandha** can have a firm **achar**. The one who is **sthira-vas-sevi** often has laxity in their **achar**. Therefore, the **gani** should always be **aniyat-vritti**. 4- If for some reason, the position of **gani** is attained at a young age, then one should make their nature like that of the elders, because as long as the nature remains fickle, there is a possibility of **atichaar** and other defects in **achar-sampat**. Therefore, there must be a change in nature, only then can **achar** be pure.

Because the life of a human being is truly **achar**, therefore, it should be protected especially. This is **achar-sampat**.

## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Fourth Dasha

Now the Sutrakar speaks about Shruta-Sampat:

**Question:** What is Shruta-Sampat?

**Answer:** Shruta-Sampat is of four types:

1. **Bahushruta:** One who has read and studied many Shrutis.
2. **Parichayashruta:** One who knows all the Shrutis.
3. **Vichittrashruta:** One who has a deep understanding of the Shrutis and can explain them in various ways.
4. **Ghosh Vishuddhi Karaka:** One who has purified their understanding of the Shrutis and can use them to guide others.

This is Shruta-Sampat.

**Explanation:**

The student asks the teacher about Shruta-Sampat. The teacher explains that Shruta-Sampat is of four types: Bahushruta, Parichayashruta, Vichittrashruta, and Ghosh Vishuddhi Karaka.

**Meaning:**

Shruta-Sampat is the state of being fully adorned with the knowledge of the Shrutis. It is the possession of the qualities of Bahushruta, Parichayashruta, Vichittrashruta, and Ghosh Vishuddhi Karaka.

**Commentary:**

After discussing Achar-Sampat, the Sutrakar now describes Shruta-Sampat. Shruta-Sampat is the state of being fully adorned with the knowledge of the Shrutis. It is the possession of the qualities of Bahushruta, Parichayashruta, Vichittrashruta, and Ghosh Vishuddhi Karaka. A Gani who has studied the main texts of the Shrutis and has the ability to understand and interpret them is considered to be a Bahushruta or a possessor of Shruta-Sampat.

Page #167:
---------------------------
## Fourth Stage

**With Hindi Commentary**

(It has been said) that the scripture should never be forgotten, just like its own letters, its pronunciation should be pure, it should be a practitioner of the study of the Shruti-shastra, it should have a critical understanding of its own time (opinion) and the time (opinion) of others, it should have developed a unique understanding in its knowledge, so that while giving lectures, it can show the merits and demerits of both opinions and properly nourish its own opinion, only then can it be the true possessor of Shruti-sampat. The name of expressing one's thoughts in a well-crafted language with the use of Yamak, Upma, and other figures of speech is Shruti-vaichitrya. This is called the uniqueness of Shruti-knowledge.

**66**

While reciting the Shruti-shastra, one should pay full attention to the Udatta, Anudatta, and Svarita tones, and the recitation should be pure and full of tones. This is called Ghosh-vishuddhi. If the Shruti is not pronounced with Ghosh-vishuddhi, then there cannot be Arth-vishuddhi either. Therefore, Ghosh-vishuddhi must come first. The verses that fall in the Saaj, Rishabh, Gandhar, Madhyam, Pancham, Nishad, and Dhaivat should be sung in the same tone. Only then will it be particularly beneficial and more enjoyable.

Therefore, it is proven that the true possessor of Shruti-sampat is the one who has studied and contemplated the Shruti with its divisions and sub-divisions. This Shruti-sampat, along with the aforementioned sub-divisions, is the true Shruti-sampat. In this sutra, the inseparability of the name and the named (the one who possesses the name) is established.

After Shruti-sampat, the sutrakar now describes the subject of Sharira-sampat:

**"Se kim tan sarira-sampya? Sarira-sampya cau-vviha pannaatta, tan jaha- aaroha- parinaha- sampanne yaavi bhavaai, anottapp- sarire, thira- sanghayanne, bahu padipunnidie yaavi bhavaai. Se tan sarira-sampya."**

**"Ath ka sharira-sampat? Sharira-sampat chaurvidha prajnapta, tadyaatha- aaroha-parinaha sampannashchaapi bhavati, anuttrapasheera, sthira-sanhananah, bahu pratipurnendriyaschaapi bhavati. Saisha sharira-sampat."**

**Translation:**

What is Sharira-sampat? Sharira-sampat is known to be of four types, namely: one who is endowed with a well-developed body, one who has a strong body, one who has a stable constitution, and one who has many fully developed senses. This is Sharira-sampat.

Page #168:

## 100
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

"What, O Bhagavan, is the meaning of 'Sarira Sampada' (body wealth)?" asked the disciple. The Guru replied, "There are four types of 'Pannatta' (explanations) regarding 'Sarira Sampada'. A body that is 'Parinaha' (wide) and 'Sampanne' (well-proportioned) is considered 'Sarira Sampada'. The words 'Avi' and 'Ya' indicate that the body should not be 'Anotappa' (repulsive) and should have a 'Thira Sanghayane' (stable structure). The words 'Api' and 'Cha' indicate that one should embrace all the auspicious qualities of the body. This is 'Sarira Sampada'."

**Meaning:** What is 'Sarira Sampada'? It is explained in four ways: the body should be proportionally tall and wide, it should not be repulsive, it should have a strong structure, and it should be mostly complete in its senses. This is 'Sarira Sampada'.

**Fourth Dasha**

**Commentary:** This Sutra describes the topic of 'Sarira Sampada'. For example, a 'Gani' (Jain monk) should have a proportionally long and wide body, he should not be ashamed, he should have a beautiful structure, and he should be mostly complete in all his senses. The words 'Cha' and 'Api' in the Sutra mean that all the auspicious qualities of the body should be present in a 'Gani'. Because a person with a beautiful structure, if he is also full of 'Shruta Gyan' (scriptural knowledge), has an extraordinary impact on people. Therefore, the Sutrakar (author of the Sutra) has said that there should be no defects like 'Anga Bhang' (deformity) in the body, because it creates natural disgust in the minds of people and also generates shame in oneself. The word 'Prayah' indicates that it is essential to be complete in all senses, because when each sense is complete and the limbs are in their proper place according to auspicious 'Nama Karma' (karmic actions), then the observer's mind will be attracted towards him with wonder and affection.

The body should be proportionally long and wide because if the length and width are more or less than the proportion, then even if all other qualities are present, the body will not have an attractive beauty.

The question arises: What if the body becomes deformed after attaining the position of 'Gani'?

Page #169:

## Fourth Chapter
## With Hindi Commentary

**101**

What should be done? In response, it is said that this is not a matter of one's own right, it is all dependent on karma. For the **Chhadmastha**, the first aspect is conduct.

From the reading of the sutras, it is certain that Lord Keshi Kumar, seeing the beauty of the body of Shrama and Anathi Muni Maharaj, became engrossed in Dharma.

After the **Sharira-Sampat**, the sutrakar now describes the subject of **Vachan-Sampat**:

**"Se kim tam Vayan-Sampya? Vayan-Sampya chau-viha panṇatta, tam jaha-adey-vayane yaavi bhavaï, mahur-vayane yaavi bhavaï, anissya-vayane yaavi bhavaï, asandiddha-vayane yaavi bhavaï. Se tam Vayan-Sampya."**

**"Ath ka sa Vachan-Sampat? Vachan-Sampat chaturvidha prajnapta, tadyaatha-adey-vachanaschaapi bhavati, madhur-vachanaschaapi bhavati, anishrita-vachanaschaapi bhavati, asandigdha-vachanaschaapi bhavati. Saisha Vachan-Sampat."**

**Word-by-word meaning:**

* **Se kim tam -** What is that **Vayan-Vachan Sampya -** wealth of speech?
* **Vayan-Vachan Sampya -** Wealth of speech is **chau-viha -** four types of **panṇatta -** described.
* **Tam jaha -** Like those who **adey-vayane yaavi bhavaï -** possess **adey-vachan** (words of command), **mahur-vayane yaavi bhavaï -** speak **mahur-vachan** (sweet words), **anissya-vayane yaavi bhavaï -** speak **anissya-vachan** (words without restrictions), **asandiddha-vayane yaavi bhavaï -** speak **asandiddha-vachan** (words without doubt).
* **'Api'** and **'cha'** words should be understood as used in the sense of expectation or conjunction.
* **Se tam -** This is the **Vayan-Vachan Sampya -** wealth of speech.

**Meaning:**

What is **Vachan-Sampat**? **Vachan-Sampat** is described as being of four types: one who possesses **adey-vachan**, one who speaks **mahur-vachan**, one who utters **anishrita-vachan**, and one who speaks without doubt. This is **Vachan-Sampat**.

## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## I

**Commentary:** This Sutra describes the virtue of speech. It is absolutely essential for a Gani to possess the virtue of speech, as only then can they succeed in spreading Dharma. There are four aspects to this virtue:

Firstly, a Gani should possess the quality of **adequate speech**, meaning their words should be worthy of acceptance by the people. If the people do not accept their words, it is a sign that they lack the virtue of speech. Therefore, their words should always be such that everyone accepts them as proof.

Secondly, a Gani should speak **sweet words**. However, this does not mean words that are merely pleasing to the ear like the song of a cuckoo, but rather words that are both pleasing to the ear and full of meaning. Meaningless words, even if they are sweet, cannot achieve anything. Therefore, the Sutra-kar has described that words that are meaningful, full of merit like the milk of a cow, free from defects, and full of virtues are called sweet words.

Even if a person possesses all the qualities mentioned above, words spoken under the influence of anger, pride, deceit, or greed are not praiseworthy. Therefore, the Sutra-kar has described that one should never speak under the influence of attachment, aversion, etc. It is only appropriate to speak after removing all these things, because impartial words free from attachment and aversion are universally accepted.

**Fourth Aspect:**

However, one should only speak words that are free from doubt and well-cultivated in terms of the qualities of speech. This means that the words should be clear, properly articulated, grammatically correct, complete, and convey the desired meaning. Such words, when spoken, reveal their own qualities. This is called the virtue of speech.

The essence of the entire statement is that words which are adequate, sweet, impartial, unambiguous, and clear are capable of bringing about the welfare of the noble ones.

After the virtue of speech, the Sutra-kar describes the virtue of **dancing:**

**"What is the virtue of dancing? The virtue of dancing is considered to be of four types, namely: dancing for victory, dancing for joy, dancing for liberation, and dancing for the sake of benefit. This is the virtue of dancing."** (5)

**What is the wealth of reading?** The wealth of reading is declared to be of four types, namely:

* **Vijaymuddishati:**  One who sets an objective for study.
* **Vijayavachayati:** One who teaches the determined portion.
* **Parinirvapya Vachayati:** One who teaches only as much as is appropriate.
* **Artha-niryapakachapi bhavati:** One who teaches with logic and evidence, ensuring the meaning is conveyed.

This is the wealth of reading. ||5||

**Word by Word Meaning:**

* **Vayana Sampya:** (Oh student!) The wealth of reading is of four types.
* **Chauvviha:** Four types.
* **Pannatta:** Declared.
* **Tam Jaha:** As.
* **Vijayam Uddisae:** Sets an objective for study.
* **Vijayam Vaeae:** Teaches the determined portion.
* **Parinivvaaviyam Vaase:** Teaches only as much as is appropriate.
* **Se tam Vayana Sampya:** This is the wealth of reading.

**Main Meaning:**

What is called the wealth of reading? The wealth of reading is of four types, such as:

* To consider and set an objective for the subject matter.
* To teach with consideration.
* To teach only as much as is appropriate.
* To teach with logic and evidence, ensuring the meaning is conveyed.

This is the wealth of reading.

**Commentary:**

This sutra discusses the subject of the wealth of reading, meaning it introduces the qualifications of a Gani in terms of determining the subject matter and the style of teaching. For example, when it is time to teach the students, the Gani should first understand the abilities of the students and teach each student the appropriate scripture or knowledge. If an unsuitable student is taught a very profound and mysterious scripture, the student and the scripture will be in the same state as water poured into a raw pot, meaning the student's life will be wasted and the scripture will be dishonored by being taught to someone who cannot understand it. In short, the subject matter should be determined based on the student's ability.

Simply determining the subject matter with consideration is not enough, but it is also necessary to teach it with consideration after the determination. It is important to ensure that the student is not taught more than their capacity to understand, as this will burden their mind unnecessarily.

He will even forget what he can remember. This will lead to self-contradiction and violation of restraint, therefore the disciple should be taught according to his capacity.

There are many differences of opinion regarding the subject of Vācana-sampat. Some say that it means the teacher should teach the disciple as many sūtras as the disciple can comprehend. According to others, it means to explain the mutual coherence, evidence, and logical interpretations of the meanings, and to combine the sūtra and its meaning including the case, declension, and compound etc.; and according to some others, it means to show the disciple the various synonyms of a single meaning, to teach the meaning through unique sūtras, and to teach in such a way that the disciple can know multiple meanings - and so on. The essence of all this is that the disciple should be imparted knowledge in whichever way he can acquire it. This is Vācana-sampat. In this way, the subject of curriculum and the teacher's teaching ability has been described.

After this, the author now describes Mati-sampat:
What is that Mati-sampat? Mati-sampat is declared to be of four types, namely, Uggaha-mati-sampat, Īhā-mati-sampat, Avāya-mati-sampat, and Dhāraṇā-mati-sampat.

What is that Uggaha-mati-sampat? Uggaha-mati-sampat is declared to be of six types, namely, he quickly grasps, he grasps much, he grasps in many ways, he grasps firmly, he grasps without dependence, he grasps without confusion. This is Uggaha-mati-sampat.

Similarly, Īhā-mati-sampat and Avāya-mati-sampat.

What is that Dhāraṇā-mati-sampat? Dhāraṇā-mati-sampat is declared to be of six types, namely, he retains much, he retains in many ways, he retains the ancient, he retains the difficult, he retains without dependence, he retains without confusion. This is Dhāraṇā-mati-sampat.

## Fourth Dasha

**He holds it without dependence, he holds it without doubt, this is the Dharana-mati-sampada.**

**Meaning:** O Bhagavan! What is Mati-sampada? O disciple! Mati-sampada is described as being of four types: Avgraha-mati-sampada, Iha-mati-sampada, Avaya-mati-sampada, and Dharana-mati-sampada. O Bhagavan! What is Avgraha-mati-sampada? O disciple! Avgraha-mati-sampada is described as being of six types: He quickly grasps questions, etc., he grasps it without dependence, and he grasps it without doubt. Similarly, one should understand Iha-mati and Avaya-mati. What is Dharana-mati-sampada? Dharana-mati-sampada is of six types: He holds much, he holds in many ways, he holds old things, he holds even the most difficult things, he holds without dependence, and he holds without doubt. This is called Dharana-mati-sampada.

**Commentary:** This Sutra describes the wealth of Mati-knowledge: "Mananam, Matya: Sampada - Mati-sampada." What is contemplated is called Mati, and the wealth of Mati is Mati-sampada. This Mati-sampada is described as being of four types: Avgraha, Iha, Avaya, and Dharana. What is grasped generally without any instruction is called 'Avgraha'. The specific knowledge of the object that is grasped generally is called 'Iha'. The definitive knowledge of objects from Iha-specific knowledge is called 'Avaya'. Remembering the definitive knowledge of objects is called 'Dharana'. This is the order of Mati-knowledge. For example, when someone wakes up a sleeping person, the atoms of the sound of the person waking them up, touching the auditory sense organ, are in the form of Avgraha. After that, when the sound enters the auditory sense organ, those same atoms become specific and are called Iha-mati. Then he (the sleeping person) knows that someone is waking him up, and gradually he becomes certain that it is so-and-so.

Page #175:
---------------------------
## Fourth Dasha (Chapter)
With Hindi Commentary.
107

-

The knowledge that someone is waking me up is called *Aavaay-mati-gyaan*; after it becomes certain, the understanding that a particular person is waking me up for a particular task is called *Dharana-mati-gyaan*. *Mati-gyaan* is pure, therefore it provides accurate knowledge of the nature of things.

There are six types of *Avgrah-mati*. For example, understanding someone's feelings just by listening to them, remembering the proofs from five to seven texts upon hearing a question, or grasping many texts at once; grasping in many ways, such as writing, reading, paying attention to correctness, and simultaneously narrating a story, and remembering them in this way; like a musician who can identify each instrument separately even when hearing the sound of many instruments at once; remembering something firmly after knowing it; imprinting whatever is asked in the heart, so that there is no need to write it down in a book, etc., and remembering it at the right time without any restriction; having no room for doubt in the understanding of something. These are the six types of *Avgrah-mati-gyaan*. Similarly, one should know the six types of *Iha* and *Aavaay-mati-sampada*.

Just as these six types have been explained, there are also six types of *Dharana-mati-sampada*. For example, remembering many things by hearing one thing, remembering in many ways, remembering ancient things, remembering difficult numbers like *bhaanga*, remembering without the help of a text or a person, remembering the nature of things accurately without any doubt. These are the six types of *Dharana-mati-sampada*.

The person who possesses this kind of *mati-gyaan* in a detailed way is truly capable of determining the true nature of things. This is called *mati-sampada*.

Now the Sutrakar (author of the sutras) speaks about *Prayog-sampada* next:

"What is *Prayog-mati-sampada*? *Prayog-mati-sampada* is described as having four types, as follows: *Aayam* (this) is said to be *paunjjitta* (purified) by *vaayam* (effort), *parisam* (..."

Fourth Dasha

"Giving up oneself, one becomes a Pauंज्जित्ता, giving up the field, one becomes a Pauंज्जित्ता, giving up the object, one becomes a Pauंज्जित्ता. That is the प्रयोग-मति-सम्पत्." (7)

"What is प्रयोग-मति-सम्पत्? प्रयोग-मति-सम्पत् is of four kinds, as follows: knowing oneself, one becomes a speaker, knowing the assembly, one becomes a speaker, knowing the field, one becomes a speaker, knowing the object, one becomes a speaker. That is प्रयोग-मति-सम्पत्." (7)

Word by word meaning: "What is that प्रयोग-मति-सम्पत्? (The Guru says) प्रयोग-मति-सम्पत् is of four kinds, as follows: knowing one's own ability, one becomes a speaker, knowing the assembly, one becomes a speaker, knowing the field, one becomes a speaker, knowing the object or the particular person, one becomes a speaker. That is प्रयोग-मति-सम्पत्."

Original meaning: "O Bhagavan! What is प्रयोग-मति-सम्पत्? O disciple! प्रयोग-मति-सम्पत् is described as being of four kinds, such as: one should debate after considering one's own strength, one should debate after considering the assembly, one should debate after considering the field, and one should debate after considering the subject matter or the particular person. This is प्रयोग-मति-सम्पत्."

Commentary: This Sutra describes when and how one should engage in debate. One who understands this well will be able to achieve their desired goals easily. One who is unfamiliar with this will never be able to achieve their desired goals. Therefore, knowledge of debate is essential. First of all, one should debate after considering one's own strength...

Page #177:
---------------------------
## The Fourth Stage

This story should be told with diligence. Just as a physician, knowing the disease, diagnosis, medicine, and its application, treats a patient and quickly relieves him, similarly, if a Ganī, seeing his own strength in the subject, engages in debate, he will surely succeed.

Before engaging in debate, one must carefully consider the nature of the assembly where the debate will take place, their beliefs, and the deity they worship. One must also ascertain whether the person with whom the debate will take place is knowledgeable or merely argumentative and stubborn.

One should engage in a debate about a region only when one has a thorough understanding of all the factors related to that region. For example, one should know the quantity and type of food available in the region, the amount of water available, and whether it is pleasant or not.

In a debate, knowledge of the object is crucial. Here, the word "object" refers to a specific person. For example, before a debate, one should know how many Āgamas the person with whom the debate will take place is familiar with, whether they are a king or a minister, whether they are benevolent or cruel and cunning, etc. By thoroughly understanding these aspects and their emotions, one who engages in debate will surely succeed. If one begins a lecture or debate without understanding the emotions of the other person, they may not agree with your views and act like Skanda Acharya or a guardian priest. Therefore, one should engage in a religious discourse or debate only after considering all the aforementioned factors. The word "object" also refers to things. Therefore, one must have a complete understanding of the object for which the debate is being initiated. One who engages in debate without knowledge of the subject may be attacked by stubborn people, and they may even lose their life. However, remember that life has no value in the face of Dharma. If someone threatens to take your life to make you abandon Dharma, it is better to abandon life than Dharma. As Gaj Sukumara and others have illustrated.

**Summary:** The essence is that a Ganī should always keep in mind the wealth of practice, intellect, and resources.

* During the rainy season, a field is designated for the use of many monks.
* For the use of many monks, a platform, a plank, a bed, and bedding are provided.
* It is used at the appropriate time.
* It is properly worshipped by the gurus.

## Fourth Dasha
**With Hindi Commentary**

**1**
**Original Meaning:**  O Bhagavan! What is the wealth called "Sangrah-Parigya"? O disciple! The wealth called "Sangrah-Parigya" is described as four types:  
- Observing places for residence during the rainy season for many monks.
- Accepting and providing necessary backrests, beds, and bedding for many monks.
- Performing every task at the appropriate time (according to the division of time).
- Respecting and honoring those who are older than oneself.
This is the wealth called "Sangrah-Parigya".

**111**
**Commentary:** This sutra describes the eighth wealth called "Sangrah-Parigya". For example, it is the duty of the Gani to organize the gana (group) through the following actions: 
- In worldly affairs, it is observed that whoever can protect someone becomes their subordinate. Similarly, to be the leader of the gana, the Gani must take upon himself the responsibility of protecting it. Therefore, it is appropriate for him to observe areas for the residence of many monks during the rainy season. While observing the areas, he should consider the needs of the young, weak, ascetic, yogi-bearers, or sick monks. This ensures that they receive food, water, and medicine in a timely manner. 
- Additionally, there should be suitable areas for disciples who are eager to study or have already studied, so that their Chaturmas can be peacefully observed without any obstacles. If there is no proper arrangement, it is very likely that these people will become free-spirited.

- After observing suitable areas, it is also the duty of the Gani to arrange for backrests, beds, and bedding, etc., for the use of many monks, which are to be returned after use. This is because backrests, etc., are extremely necessary during the rainy season. Many living beings are born during this season. To avoid harming them, it is essential that clothes and other equipment are kept clean. If they are dirty, there is a possibility of the birth of living beings in them, which can easily lead to the killing of living beings, which is harmful in both worlds. Therefore, the Gani must arrange for the above-mentioned equipment during the rainy season.

Page #180:
---------------------------
## 112
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Fourth Dasha

- A Gani should never deviate from his duty. The work that is scheduled for a particular time should be done at that time. For example, the production of tools, the study of scriptures, begging for alms, preaching Dharma, and service (care) etc., all these tasks should be completed in their respective times. 
- Upon receiving the title of Gani, a Sadhu should not become arrogant, but should abandon ego and serve the Guru who initiated him, from whom he learned the scriptures, by whose name he became famous, and who is senior in initiation, as well as Ratnakara etc., by rising to greet them, serving them with food and clothing, and offering them proper salutations etc. This is called Yathaguru Puja.
- The essence of this section is that the title is merely a form of command, and even after receiving it, it is paramount to follow the Dharma of humility. Just as a prince, even after becoming a king, still salutes his parents according to the rules, so should a Gani. However, if a Gani is sitting in a large assembly or a gathering of great men and sees Ratnakara but he (Ratnakara) does not come near, then not saluting him will not give rise to feelings of disrespect etc.
- This Sutra clearly describes the subject of organization. By following these rules, the organization can remain permanent. This is the eighth Gani Sampat, called Sangraha-Parijna.
- Now the Sutrakar describes the duty of a Gani towards his disciple:
- A teacher becomes a guide to his disciple through these four types of humility: by teaching him proper conduct, by teaching him the scriptures, by guiding him away from distractions, and by eliminating his faults.

## Fourth Chapter
With Hindi Commentary.

**Word-by-word meaning:** Ayario-Aacharya Antavaasi - the resident Aacharya, to his disciples, Imae - this Chauvvihae - four types of Vinay Padivattiae - Vinay - understanding, Vinaita - teaches, Bhavai - becomes, then he Nirantanam Gachchai - constantly goes, Urun - debt-free. Tam Jaha - like, Ayara - Vinanam - Aachar - Vinay, Suvinanam - Shruta - Vinay, Vikkhevna - Vinanam - Vikshepana - Vinay, Dos - Nigdhayanam - Vinaenam - Dos - Nirghat - Vinay, teaching.

**Main Meaning:** The Aacharya becomes debt-free by teaching his disciples four types of Vinay understanding: Aachar, Shruta, Vikshepana, and Dos-Nirghat.

**Commentary:** This Sutra states the duty of the Aacharya towards his disciples. Just as the disciples have the duty of Vinay-palan towards the Aacharya, similarly, the Aacharya also has a duty towards them. This is clearly stated that if the Gani teaches his disciples four types of Vinay-understanding, then he becomes debt-free from them. This automatically proves that the Gani who does not teach his disciples four types of Vinay-understanding remains indebted to them. And an indebted person is worthy of condemnation in both worldly and spiritual matters.

Therefore, the main duty of the Gani is to teach his disciples Aachar, Shruta, Vikshepana, and Dos-Nirghat Vinay and become debt-free from them. Only the Gani can make his disciples worthy of the Aacharya position, therefore, he should keep his duty in mind and teach them every type of knowledge to make them worthy. This has a positive impact on both worlds.

Now the Sutrakar describes the subject of Aachar-Vinay.

**What is that Aachar-Vinay? Aachar-Vinay is described in four ways, like - Sanjam-Samayarii Yavi Bhavai, Tav Samayarii Yavi Bhavai, Gan-Samayarii Yavi Bhavai, Ekall-Vihar-Samayarii Yavi Bhavai. This is Aachar-Vinay. ||1||**

**Word Meaning:** What is this *Aachar-Vinaya*? (The Guru says) *Aachar-Vinaya* is described as four types, like: *Sanjam-Samaachari* (teaching about *Sanjam*), *Tap-Samaachari* (teaching about *Tap* actions), *Gana-Samaachari* (teaching about *Gana* conduct), and *Ekaki-Vihar-Samaachari* (teaching about solitary dwelling). This is *Aachar-Vinaya*. The words 'cha' and 'api' indicate that it includes teaching about all the original and subsequent variations of these *Samaacharis*.

**Main Meaning:** What is *Aachar-Vinaya*? *Aachar-Vinaya* is described as having four types, namely: *Sanjam-Samaachari*, *Tap-Samaachari*, *Gana-Samaachari*, and *Ekaki-Vihar-Samaachari*. (The one who teaches all of these is the true practitioner of *Aachar-Vinaya*.) This is *Aachar-Vinaya*.

**Commentary:** This Sutra describes *Aachar-Vinaya*. The primary duty of a *Gani* is to first make their disciples proficient in *Aachar-Vinaya*. Once proficient in *Aachar-Vinaya*, the attainment of other *Vinayas* becomes easier. The Sutra-maker of *Aachar-Vinaya* has described four types, like: teaching about *Sanjam-Samaachari* is the first type. *Sanjam* is defined as the cessation of actions through knowledge, etc. It is described as 17 types: *Pancha-Ashrava* (five types of *Ashrava*), violence, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, attachment, five senses, anger, pride, deceit, greed, mind, speech, and body restraint. *Sanjam-Samaachari* is defined as practicing *Sanjam* oneself, stabilizing those who are weakening in *Sanjam*, and knowing and teaching about the different types of *Sanjam*. Similarly, one should understand *Tap-Samaachari*, meaning: practicing all the different types of *Tap* oneself, encouraging those who are practicing *Tap*, stabilizing those who are weakening in *Tap* actions, and...

Knowing all the external and internal aspects of austerities is called **Tapo-Samachari**.

**Gana-Samachari** is to diligently protect the Gana (group of monks) from dangers like Sarana and Varana, to properly manage the sick, children, elderly, and weak monks in the Gana, to interact appropriately with other Ganās, and to continuously cultivate right faith, knowledge, vision, and conduct within one's own Gana.

**Ekaaki-Vihar-Samachari** is to know the complete details of solitary dwelling (including its various aspects and sub-aspects), to carefully understand its methods, to take the vow of solitary dwelling oneself, to encourage others to do the same, and to keep an eye on those monks who have taken this vow according to the Gani's instructions. It also includes paying attention to all other matters related to solitary dwelling.

It is appropriate for the Gani to constantly remind the disciples of these Samacharis.

Only a person who is well-versed in conduct is worthy of the scriptures. Therefore, the Sutra-kar (author of the sutras) says about **Shruta-Vinaya** (discipline of the scriptures):

**2. What is Shruta-Vinaya? Shruta-Vinaya is of four types: reciting the sutras, explaining the meaning, explaining the benefit, and explaining everything completely. This is Shruta-Vinaya.**

## Dasha-Shruta-Skandha Sutra
## Fourth Dasha

**What is Shruta-Vinaya?** Shruta-Vinaya is described as being of four types: Sutra-reading, Artha-reading, Hita-vachana-reading, and Nisha-sha-vachana-reading. This is called Shruta-Vinaya.

**Commentary:** This Sutra presents four types of Shruta-Vinaya in a question-and-answer style. The first is Sutra-reading, which means that one should read the Anga and Ananga Shastras, the Aaukalika-Shruta and the Kalika-Shruta, all with purity of voice and other aspects, and teach others in the same way. Similarly, one should understand the meaning. Because until the Artha-vachana is done correctly, the essence of the Sutra cannot be understood.

After this comes the topic of Hita-vachana. This means that one should teach the Shruta that is suitable for the individual, that is, the Shruta that can help their soul. If one teaches without considering the student's capacity, it will harm their soul and also the Shruta. Just as one has to wash their hands after putting milk or other substances in a raw pot, one should be aware of the student and the Shruta. Therefore, before teaching, one should consider the student's capacity and their benefit. Shruta taught with discernment of benefit and harm is beneficial for both. While giving lectures, one should give lectures that benefit the audience. While introducing the student's capacity, one should also consider their intellect and age.

After this comes the topic of Nisha-sha-vachana. In Nisha-sha-vachana, one should teach using the five elements of Pramanana, Nikshepa, Upoddhata, Pratijna, and Hetu. One should also study and teach using Samhita, Padachheda, Padartha, Pad-vigraha, Chalana (doubt), and Prasiddhi (resolution). One should not start another Shastra in the middle of one that has been started. Even in the presence of obstacles, one should complete the Shastra that has been started.

This is Shruta-Vinaya. Its explanation clearly shows that Shruta-Vinaya...

The meaning is not to lock up books in a chest, nor is it to study the text without understanding its meaning, but to study the text with an understanding of its meaning. The question arises, what is the meaning of the word "Sutra"? The answer is that which informs about the meaning is called a Sutra, or that which is without meaning, like a seed, and whose meaning is not understood, is called a Sutra, and that which binds the meanings is also a Sutra, or that which is a Sutra-like guide. Therefore, one should study the Sutras with meaning and method, so that one can achieve real Shruta-knowledge.

Now the Sutrakar describes the subject of Viksepanavinaya:

**What is this Viksepanavinaya? Viksepanavinaya is described as fourfold, as follows: one who makes a person who has not seen the right faith see it, one who makes a person who has seen the right faith become a true follower of the faith, one who establishes a person who has fallen from the faith back into the faith, and one who raises a person for the benefit, happiness, forgiveness, liberation, and following of that very faith. This is Viksepanavinaya.**

**Word by Word Meaning:**

**Se kim tam -** What is that?
**Viksepanavinaya -** Viksepanavinaya?
**(Guru says)**
**Viksepanavinaya -** Viksepanavinaya
**Chauvhihe -** fourfold

**Arthat usko sahdharmi banave -** that is, makes him a true follower of the faith

Suhae - for happiness, Khamae - for strength, Nissee Saae - for welfare, Anugaamiyattae - for following, Abbhutteetta Udyat Bhavai Ho. Se Tan - this is Vikkhevna - Vin - Viksepana - Vinay.

## Fourth Dasha

##  Mulaarth - What is Viksepana - Vinay?

Vikksepana - Vinay is described as being of four types: 
1. Showing the path of Dharma to someone who has not seen Dharma before and making them Samyak-tvi.
2. Making a Samyak-tvi into a Sarva-vrati.
3. Stabilizing someone who has fallen from Dharma back into Dharma.
4. Being diligent for the benefit of that same Dharma, for happiness, for liberation, and for following - this is Viksepana - Vinay.

##  Tika

This Sutra describes the subject of Viksepana - Vinay, and like the previous Sutras, it is in the form of a question and answer. The disciple asks, "O Bhagavan! What is Viksepana - Vinay?" The Guru answers, "O disciple! When the listener's mind is disturbed by accusations made at the wrong time, stabilizing them in their own self-control is Viksepana - Vinay."

This Viksepana - Vinay is described as being of four types: 
1. Making those who have not seen the Dharma in the form of Samyak-darshan, to be established in Samyak-darshan, that is, teaching them the Dharma in the form of Samyak-darshan. But keep in mind that when teaching someone the Dharma in the form of Samyak-darshan, one should treat them with love and courtesy, as one would treat a well-known and previously familiar guest. If they are spoken to with love, they will quickly abandon false desires and become established in Samyak-darshan.
2. When they become established in Samyak-darshan, they should be made into a co-religionist by giving them the education of character in the form of Sarva-vrutti.
3. After this, for their benefit, for their enjoyment of happiness, one should be diligent in that same Dharma in the form of Samyak-darshan, because only when this is done can one's own welfare and the welfare of others be achieved. This is called Viksepana - Vinay.

This sutra discusses the subject of **dosa-nigghayana-vinaya**. The main purpose of this **vinaya** is to destroy **kashaya** (passions) and other faults. It is of four types. The first type is to remove the anger of the angry one. If a disciple in the group is prone to anger, it is the duty of the **gani** (teacher) to use gentle words to explain and understand, and in this way...

Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
Fourth Dasha

Just as the shade of a Vajul tree removes poison and its effects, anger is calmed. The second aspect is to remove the faults of the wicked. That is, if someone's mind has become corrupted by vices like kshaya, etc., then the Gani should remove those faults by teaching him about conduct and good character. The third aspect is to remove the desires of a person who has desires. For example, if someone desires food, water, clothes, utensils, travel, education, or other things, then the Gani should remove them through appropriate means. If a desire-fault arises regarding Samyaktva, then that should also be removed. One should free their soul from these faults and focus on the things that are not self, i.e., the soul should be brought under control and directed towards Samadhi. This is called Dosha-Nirghatan-Vinaya. _ Thus, after being well-instructed by the Acharya, it is the duty of the disciple to be respectful towards the Acharya.

Now the Sutrakar explains this same topic:

Tassevam Gunajaayasass Antevasiss Ima Chau-Viha Vinay-Padivatti Bhavai, Tam Jaha-Uvagaran-Uppayanaya, Sahillaaya, Vana-Sanjalanaya, Bhar-Pacchoruhanaya. _ Tasyaivaṁ guṇajātiyasyāntevāsina eṣā caturvidhā vinaya-pratipattir bhavati, tadyathā-upakarṇotpādanatā, sāhayatā, varṇasaṁjvalanatā, bhāra-pratyavarohaṇatā.

**With Hindi Commentary**

**Commentary:** This sutra describes that when a Ganī has thoroughly taught a disciple the principles of humility, it is the disciple's duty to be humble towards the Ganī. Four types of humility towards the Ganī are described, such as: creating tools for the Gan, helping the weak, revealing the qualities of the Gan or Ganī, and bearing the burden of the Gan.

**121**
The sutrakar will explain each of these separately, but it is important to understand here that the meaning of "Vinaaya-prati-patti" in this sutra refers to Guru-bhakti, acting according to the Guru's instructions.

Now the sutrakar describes the subject of "Upakarana-utpadanata":

**"Se kim tam uvagaran-uppaayanaya? Uvagaran-uppaayanaya cauvviha pannatta, tam jaha - anuppannaanam uvagaranaanam uppaaitta bhavaai, poraanaanam uvagaranaanam sarakkhitta sangavitta bhavaai, parittam jaanitta paccuuddharitta bhavaai, ahaavidhi sanvibhaitta bhavaai.

Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
Fourth Dasha
It is said that the one who divides things according to the rules is the one who produces the means.
Meaning: What is meant by the production of means? There are four types of production of means: producing means that are not yet produced, protecting or maintaining old means, rescuing means that are lacking, and dividing means according to the rules. This is the production of means.
Commentary: This sutra describes the subject of the production of means. It is the duty of the disciples to produce means, because if the means like vessels are not present in the order, then how will the Ganī distribute them in the order? The work of the Ganī can only proceed smoothly with the help of the disciples. If the Ganī himself takes on this burden, then it will hinder his study and other activities. Secondly, it is also the duty of the disciple to properly protect all the old means. For example, keeping clothes that are useful in winter in a safe place after the end of winter, so that they can be used again in the next winter, sewing torn clothes, and protecting blankets and other clothes from the birth of living beings during the four months, and keeping them in a place where there is no fear of thieves, and the means are properly protected, etc.
If a Muni has few means (means are lacking) and needs other means, then he should give him means from his own. Clothes, water, food, etc. should be divided according to the rules. For example, a Ratnakar should be given clothes, etc. that are suitable for a Ratnakar, and a Muni who is a holder of means should be given clothes, etc. that are suitable for him. Similarly, the food that is suitable for someone should be given to him.
The summary is that if all the work proceeds in this order, then the order will be organized without any difficulty, because the main reason for the collection is to protect things justly.

After this, the Sutrakar now describes the subject of *Sāhillayā* (assistance):

**"What is that *Sāhillayā*? *Sāhillayā* is declared to be of four types, namely: *Aṇuloma-vai-sahita* (one who speaks in accordance with the Dharma), *Aṇuloma-kāya-kriyāvān* (one who acts in accordance with the Dharma), *Paḍirūva-kāya-saṁphāsaṇayā* (one who touches the body of another in a way that brings them comfort), and *Savvatthesu-apaḍilomāyā* (one who is not deceitful in all matters). That is *Sāhillayā*.**

**Word-by-word meaning:**

* **Se kim tam** - What is that?
* **Sāhillayā** - Assistance
* **Sāhillayā-vinayā** - The conduct of assistance
* **Chauvviha** - Four types
* **Paṇṇattā** - Declared

* **Savvatthesu** - In all matters
* **Apaḍilomāyā** - Not deceitful
* **Se tam** - That is

**Meaning:**

What is assistance? Assistance is declared to be of four types, namely: one who speaks in accordance with the Dharma, one who acts in accordance with the Dharma, one who touches the body of another in a way that brings them comfort, and one who is not deceitful in all matters. This is assistance.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra speaks about the subject of assistance. It states that there are four types of assistance. The first is speaking words that are in accordance with the Dharma and beneficial. This means that one should first listen to the words of the Guru with respect and then speak them with their own mouth. Just as the revered Bhagavan teaches, this subject is truly...

## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

In the same way, the disciple should lovingly follow whatever the Guru commands. Another way to serve the Guru is through the body, meaning the disciple should serve the Guru in whatever way the Guru commands, with proper respect and care. The disciple should serve the Guru's body in the same way they would serve the body of another being (**Pratirupa-Kaya-Sansparshata** - as they would bear and carry the limbs of another).

In addition to the above mentioned forms of assistance, the disciple should perform all the tasks of the Guru and others with integrity. The disciple should not be deceitful in any of their actions. Rather, the disciple should perform the task for which the Guru has given the command, with love and devotion, at the time of the command. This is called **Sahayata-Vinaya**. **Sahayasyabhavaha Sahayata** - meaning, to perform the tasks of others with a spirit of helping them is called **Sahayata**.

## Fourth Dasha

Now the Sutrakar describes the topic of **Varna-Sanjwalanata**:

**Se Kim Tam Varn-Sanjwalanaya? Varn-Sanjwalanaya Chauvviha Pannaatta, Tam Jaha - Aha-Tacchanam Varn-Vayi Bhavai, Avarnavai Padhihanitta Bhavai, Varn-Vayi Anubuhitta Bhavai, Ay-Vuddhasevi Yavi Bhavai. Se Tam Varn-Sanjwalanaya ||3||**

**Padyarth Anvaya** - **Se Kim Tam** - What is that **Varn-Sanjwalanaya** - **Varn-Sanjwalanata**? (The Guru says) **Varn-Sanjwalanaya** - **Varn-Sanjwalanata** **Chauvviha** - is of four types, **Pannaatta** - described. **Tam Jaha** - such as - **Aha-Tacchanam** - truthful **Varn-Vayi** - **Varnvadi** Bhavai - is, **Avarnavadi** - of those who are not **Varnvadi**, **Padhihanitta** - a refuter Bhavai - is, **Varn-Vayi** - of the qualities of **Varnvadi**, **Anubuhitta** - a revealer Bhavai - is, **Ay** - of one's own self, **Vuddhasevi** - a servant of the elders Bhavai - is. **Se Tam** - this is **Varn-Sanjwalanaya** - **Varn-Sanjwalanata**.

Page #193:
---------------------------
## Fourth Stage (Chaturthi Dasha)

**With Hindi Commentary**

**Original Meaning:** What is "Varna-Sanjwalnata"? "Varna-Sanjwalnata" is described as having four types: one who speaks of the true qualities, one who refutes the "Avarnavadi" (one who does not speak of the qualities), one who praises the "Varnavadi" (one who speaks of the qualities), and one who serves the elders with their soul. This is called "Varna-Sanjwalnata".

**Commentary:** This sutra describes "Varna-Sanjwalnata", a type of humility. The word "Varna" originates from the root "Varna", meaning to expand speech. In this context, "Varna-Sanjwalnata" refers to "Gunanuvaad" (praising the qualities) or "Yashogaan" (praising the glory). Four types of this are described. For example, a disciple should refute those who constantly criticize the Acharya (teacher) or others, by giving a proper response and silencing them. They should also educate them with logic so that they never dare to commit such evil acts in the future. One should praise and encourage those who praise the Gan (group) or Acharya, and introduce them to the public. Along with this, one should serve the elders with their soul. If the elders are nearby, one should serve them with devotion. Even if they are far away, one should be present in their service by performing their actions.

This sutra teaches everyone that one should only describe the qualities that exist, not the ones that don't. However, one should definitely educate those who criticize the Acharya or the Gan in any way.

After this, the sutrakar (author) describes "Bhar-Pratyavarohaanta" (humility):

"What is "Bhar-Pachchoruhaanta"? "Bhar-Pachchoruhaanta" is described as having four types: one who is united with the "Asanghiya-Parijan" (those who are not united), one who is united with the "Ayar Goyar" (those who are not united), one who stands firm in the face of the "Sahammia" (those who are united) who are being oppressed, and one who stands firm in the face of the "Sahammia" who are being accused."

## Chapter 4: 

When disputes arise among the community, those who are **anisiṭṭovaśī** (free from attachment to material possessions), **vaśiṭṭa** (self-controlled), **apakkagghiya** (free from prejudice), **majjhattha-bhāva-bhūta** (holding a middle ground), and **sammṁ vavaharāmaṇe** (acting justly) should strive to **adhigaṇassa khmāvaṇāe** (resolve the dispute with forgiveness), **viūsamanaṭṭāe** (with calmness), and **sayāsamīyaṁ** (with equanimity). They should **abbuṭṭiṭṭā bhavaī** (remain steadfast) and act in a way that is **sāhammīya** (harmonious), **appasaddā** (with few words), **apphañjha** (without agitation), **appakalhā** (without quarreling), **appakasāya** (without anger), **appatumantuma** (without arrogance), **sanjama-bahulā** (with much self-control), **sanvara-bahulā** (with much restraint), **samāhi-bahulā** (with much concentration), **appamattā** (mindful), and **sanjameṇa tavasa appāṇaṁ bhāvemaṇāṇaṁ** (cultivating themselves through self-control and austerity). They should **evaṁ ca ṇṁ viharejja** (conduct themselves in this way). This is **bhāra-paccūruhaṇayā** (the way to overcome burdens).

This, I say, is the **aṭṭaviha gaṇi-sampyā** (eightfold wealth of the community) as taught by the **therēhiṁ bhagavantehiṁ** (venerable ones, the enlightened ones).

Thus ends the fourth chapter.

## What is **bhāra-pratyavarohaṇatā** (the way to overcome burdens)?

**Bhāra-pratyavarohaṇatā** is of four types:

1. **Asangrahiṭa-parijana-sangrahiṭā bhavati** (one who gathers those who are not attached to material possessions).
2. **Śaikṣamācāra-gocare sangrāhayitā bhavati** (one who gathers those who are well-versed in the principles of conduct).
3. **Sādharmikasyā glāyatā yathābalaṁ vaiyāvṛttyā'abhyutthātā bhavati** (one who, with strength and skill, helps those who are weak in their faith).
4. **Sādharmikāṇām adhikaraṇe utpanne tatrāniśriṭo-paśroṭāvasanna-pakṣa-grāhi, madhyastha-bhāva-bhūtaḥ, samyag-vyavaharams tasya adhikaraṇasya kṣamāpanāya, upaśamanāya sadāsamitaṁ abhyutthātā bhavati** (one who, when a dispute arises among the community, remains neutral, listens patiently, and acts justly to resolve the dispute with forgiveness and calmness).

How should **sādhārmikāḥ** (those who follow the right path) act in such situations? They should be **alpaśabdāḥ** (with few words), **alpajhañjhāḥ** (without agitation), **alpakaṣāyāḥ** (without anger), **alpakalhāḥ** (without quarreling), **alpātumantumaḥ** (without arrogance), **sanjama-bahulāḥ** (with much self-control), **sanvara-bahulāḥ** (with much restraint), **samādhi-bahulāḥ** (with much concentration), **apramattāḥ** (mindful), and **sanjameṇa tapasātmanam bhāvayanto vihareyuḥ** (cultivating themselves through self-control and austerity). This is **bhāra-pratyavarohaṇatā** (the way to overcome burdens).

This, I say, is the **aṣṭaviḍhā gaṇi-sampadā** (eightfold wealth of the community) as taught by the **sthavirair bhagavadbhiḥ** (venerable ones, the enlightened ones).

Thus ends the fourth chapter.

---------------------------
Dasha-Shruta-Skandha-Sutra
While engaging in this, without grasping any particular side, one should adopt a neutral stance and follow the right conduct. One should always be ready to forgive and pacify that conflict, because by doing so, there will be fewer words among the co-religionists, less agitation (words that create disturbance and conflict), less conflict and less passions, and less "you-you". With the reduction of all these, the growth of self-control, restraint, and equanimity will occur, and the co-religionists, being vigilant, will wander about contemplating their soul through self-control and austerity. This is the Bhara-Pratyavarohaṇatā-Vinaya (the humility of bearing the burden and relinquishing it). This is what the venerable elders have expounded as the eight-fold Gaṇi-Sampada (the wealth of the ascetic community), thus I say.

Fourth Stage
Commentary - In this sutra, while describing the Bhara-Pratyavarohaṇatā-Vinaya, the conclusion of the present stage has also been made. Just as a king, after entrusting the entire kingdom to his council of ministers, himself experiences the happiness of the kingdom, similarly, the Gaṇi, after entrusting the entire burden of protecting the community to the disciple community, becomes carefree and immerses himself in the happiness of self-equanimity. This burden is of four types. The first among them is to gather the un-gathered disciples, etc., that is, if a disciple has been separated from the disciple community due to defects like anger, etc., or if the protector, teacher, etc. of a disciple has passed away, or if a disciple wishes to become a householder due to some other special reason, then he should be persuaded and kept with him in whatever way possible. Further, the newly initiated ascetics should be lovingly taught the conduct of knowledge, conduct, begging, and supervision. The sick co-religious ascetic should be served to the best of one's ability. If a conflict ever arises among the co-religionists, then, being free from attachment and aversion, devoid of the desire for sustenance (food or possessions), clanship, and shelter, and adopting only a neutral stance, one should always be ready to forgive and pacify that conflict in accordance with the right conduct, etc. This will bring peace to the conflict and eliminate unnecessary clamor in the community.

-
There will be no hindrance to the disciples' study, recitation, and meditation, and there will be no words like "you" and "you" that disturb the peace of the assembly due to anger, etc. With the elimination of strife, there will be an increase in restraint and self-control, and meditations related to knowledge, vision, and character will also begin to arise. The monks will wander without negligence, practicing restraint and austerity, contemplating their own souls, i.e., realizing their true nature. This is called the Vinaya of the Burden-Lifting.
In this way, the venerable Bhagavants have described eight types of assembly wealth. These eight types of wealth are beneficial for every individual. From the study of this Dasha, the Ganis and the disciples come to know their respective duties well.
Because in reality, emotional wealth is capable of revealing the true nature of the soul, therefore, it is appropriate for every being to adorn their soul with emotional wealth and become a seeker of liberation.
Thus, Shri Sudha Swami Ji says to his disciple Shri Jambu Swami Ji, "O Jambu Swamin! Just as I have heard the meaning of this Dasha from Shri Shraman Bhagavan Mahavira Swami Ji, in the same way, I have told you, but I have not said anything from my own intellect."

## The Fifth Stage: Chitta-Samadhi

The fourth stage described the wealth of the Ganis. A Gani, filled with this wealth, becomes Samadhi-Sampaanna. However, until he gains proper knowledge of Chitta-Samadhi, he cannot enter Samadhi in the right way. Therefore, in relation to the fourth stage, the Sutrakar describes Chitta-Samadhi in this fifth stage.

Chitta-Samadhi is the state where the mind remains steady in the path of liberation, Dharma-Dhyana, etc. It is of two types: Dravya-Chitta-Samadhi and Bhava-Chitta-Samadhi. If a person desires to enjoy worldly objects and achieves them, attaining mental stability through them, it is called Dravya-Samadhi.  Bhava-Chitta-Samadhi is the experience of the nature of useful objects by focusing the mind on knowledge, perception, and conduct. When the unskillful mind is suppressed and the skillful mind manifests, Samadhi arises naturally in the mind.

Maintaining equality in the five senses and the unity of substances through mutual equality is Dravya-Samadhi. Just as sugar mixed in milk in the right proportion can be particularly enjoyable, but if it is more or less, it will never be satisfactory, similarly, Dravya-Samadhi can only be achieved if the substances are combined in the right proportion. Likewise, the area where the mind becomes absorbed in Samadhi is called Kshetra-Samadhi, and the time in which the mind...

## The Fifth Stage

**With Hindi Translation**

**131**

When samadhi arises, the time of its arising is called **kal-samadhi**. **Bhav-samadhi** is of the form of knowledge, perception, character, and austerity. When the mind becomes concentrated on these four, **bhav-samadhi** arises. But all this happens only through the purity of the field, etc. If the field, etc. are pure, the mind will naturally incline towards samadhi.

This present stage describes **bhav-chitta-samadhi**. Its first sutra is as follows:

_Suyam me ausam tenam Bhagavaya evam akkhaayam, ih khalu therihin Bhagavantehin das chitta-samahi-thanna pannatta. Kayaraim khalu tai therihin Bhagavantehin das chitta-samahi-thanna pannatta? Imaim khalu tai therihin Bhagavantehin das chitta-samahi-thanna pannatta, tam jaha:_

_Shrut am mayaushamn! Ten Bhagavatai evam akhyatam, ih khalu sthaviraibhagavadbhir das chitta-samadhi-sthanaani prajnaptaani, kataraani khalu tani sthaviraibhagavadbhir das chitta-samadhi-sthanaani prajnaptaani? Imani khalu tani sthaviraibhagavadbhir das chitta-samadhi-sthanaani prajnaptaani, tadya tha:_

**Word-by-word meaning:**

Ausam - O Ayushman disciple! Me - I have Suyam - heard Tenam - from that Bhagavaya - Bhagavan, Evam - in this way Akhaayam - has been explained. Ih - in this Jain-doctrine, Khalu - certainly Therihin - by the sthavira Bhagavantehin - Bhagavans, Das - ten Chitta-samahi - chitta-samadhi's Thanna - places, Pannatta - have been explained. (The disciple asks) Kayara - which Khalu - certainly Tai - those Therihin - by the sthavira Bhagavantehin - Bhagavans, Das - ten Chitta-samahi - chitta-samadhi's Thanna - places, Pannatta - have been explained? (The guru answers) Imaim - these Khalu - certainly Tai - those Therihin - by the sthavira Bhagavantehin - Bhagavans, Das - ten Chitta-samahi - chitta-samadhi's Thanna - places, Pannatta - have been explained, Tam jaha - as follows:

**Original meaning:**

O Ayushman disciple! I have heard that Bhagavan has explained in this way, in this Jain-doctrine or world, the sthavira Bhagavans have explained ten places of chitta-samadhi. The disciple asks - which ones?

**The Ten Stages of Mind-Concentration**

The venerable ones have expounded ten stages of mind-concentration. What are they? The teacher replies: The venerable ones have expounded these ten stages of mind-concentration. For example:

**The Fifth Stage**

**Commentary:** The beginning of this stage, like the previous four stages, is also presented by the Sutrakar in the form of a dialogue between the teacher and the student. This style is so engaging that it helps to strengthen the principles and provide knowledge to the people without any special effort. This is the easiest way to impart the knowledge of the scriptures.

Now, the Sutrakar describes the subject matter, saying:

At that time, in that era, there was a trading town called Vanijyagram. Here, the description of the town should be mentioned. Outside this trading town, in the north-east direction, there was a stupa called Duutipalashaka. The description of the stupa should be mentioned. The king Jitashatru had a queen named Dharani. Thus, the entire context should be mentioned. Until the earth-stone slab, the assembly of the master had departed. The Dharma was spoken, and the assembly accepted it.

**Word-by-word meaning:**

* Teṇam kāleṇam - At that time
* Teṇam samaeṇam - In that era
* Vaṇijyagāme nagare hotthā - There was a trading town
* Ettham - Here
* Nagar-vaṇṇao - Description of the town

R
Bahiya - Outside, in the north-north-east direction, in the north-east quadrant, there should be a cheiya-vyantarayatan called Dooti-Palasa, Dooti-Palashak. The description of this cheiya-chaitya should be narrated, just as King Jitashatru and his queen Dharani were there. All the samosaranam-samavasaran should be narrated until the Lord was seated on the silapattak of the earth. Then the parisa-parivad of the city came out. Dharma was spoken, meaning dharma-upadesh was given. Then the parisa-parishat, having heard the dharma-katha, went back to the city.
Original Meaning - In that time and at that time, the city of Banijgram was inhabited. Outside that city, in the north-east corner, there was a garden called Dooti-Palashak. There, King Jitashatru ruled. His queen was named Dharani. The Lord was seated on a silapattak of the earth in that chaitya (garden). There, the city's council (to hear the story from the mouth of the Lord) was present. Then the Lord gave dharma-upadesh to that council and (pleased with it, the people praised the Lord and) went back to the city.
Commentary - This sutra is in the form of an introduction. A detailed description of this introduction is given at the beginning of the Aupapatik Sutra. There, this (introduction) is divided into five parts. For example, the description of the city, the description of the chaitya (yakshayatan and garden) outside the city, the description of the king and queen, the description of the Lord being seated in the chaitya, and the description of the king hearing dharma-upadesh from the Lord. In addition to all this, the description of the king's journey is given with great ceremony and celebration. Along with this, the king's daily routine and his various exercises, the gymnasium, and the activities of bathing, etc., are also shown. The dharma-upadesh given by the Lord is also described smoothly. Those who are particularly interested in this subject or who are curious about it should learn about these topics from the Aupapatik Sutra. Here, only a brief description is given.

## Chapter 134: The Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

**The Story:**

In the final part of the fourth Araka, there was a city named Vanijgrama, a very beautiful city filled with civic virtues. Outside the city, in the northeast corner, was a very beautiful garden called Duitipalashaka. In this garden was a temple of a Yaksha named Duitipalashaka. This temple was famous throughout the world at that time. Many travelers came there and received direct benefits. Near the temple was a large group of trees, in the middle of which, under an Ashoka tree, was a stone slab, which served as a throne. In this city, a king named Jitashatru ruled, a just, righteous, and virtuous king. His queen was Dharani, a devoted and virtuous woman.

One time, the Shraman Bhagwan Shri Mahavira Swami was preaching Dharma in the country and arrived in the city of Vanijgrama. He stayed outside the city, in the Duitipalasha Chaitya (garden), on the aforementioned stone slab under the Ashoka tree, with his disciples. Maharaja Jitashatru and other city residents, upon hearing the good news of Bhagwan's arrival, came to see him with great celebration, eager to receive Dharma Amrit from his mouth. They presented themselves in his service. Bhagwan lovingly gave them Dharma Amrit. Filled with joy, the people became absorbed in praising him, and they embraced the Dharma of Sarvavritti and Deshavritti, returning to the city. This is the summary of the entire introduction.

**The Fifth Dasha:**

In this Sutra, the words "Kal" and "Samaya" are often used with the same meaning, but here there is a difference in their meaning. The word "Kal" refers to the fourth division of the Avasarpini Kal, and the word "Samaya" refers to the city and other things contemporary with Bhagwan Mahavira Swami.

The third case ending "Kalena" and "Samayena" is used for the cause. "Tena Kalena - Avasarpini Chaturtharaka Lakshananena Hetubhuten. Tena Samaye Tadvisheshbhuten Hetuna Vaniggramao Nagaro Hottha - Abhavadasiditiyarthah." This third case ending is translated in Sanskrit as "Tasmin Kale Tasmin Samaye" - the seventh case ending. There is no fault in this, because in Aarsh Prakrit, the third case ending is often used in the sense of the seventh case ending. Alternatively, considering "Nam" in the sense of a figure of speech and considering the "A" in "T" as an addition like the "A" in "Karemi," "Bhanta," etc., the word "E" can also express the meaning of the seventh case ending. Therefore, the translation of "Tena Kalena" and "Tena Samayena" as "Tasmin Kale Tasmin Samaye" is appropriate. This knowledge can be obtained from Prakrit grammar.

The Fifth Chapter
With Hindi Commentary.

Here, the implication is simply that the Lord preached his Dharma in the Duitipalashaka Chaitya, and the assembly was pleased to hear it.

What happened next is described by the Sutrakar in the following Sutra:

"Ajjo!" Thus, the Shraman Bhagavan Mahavira, addressing the Shraman Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis, said, "Here, indeed, Aryas! Nirgranthas or Nirgranthis, Iriya-Samitas, Bhasha-Samitas, Eshana-Samitas, Aayana-Bhanda-Matra-Nikkshepana-Samitas, Uccara-Prasravana-Khel(Nishthivan)-Shleeshma-Mala-Paristhapana-Samitas, Mana-Samitas, Vaka-Samitas, Kaya-Samitas."

Word-by-word meaning: Ajjo iti - O Aryas! Samane - Shraman Bhagavan - Bhagavan Mahavira Swami - Mahavira Swami, Samana - Shraman Nirgrantha - Nirgranthas, and Nirgranthio - Nirgranthis, Aamantitta - having invited, Evam - thus, Vayasi - began to say, Iha - in this Jin-Shasana or in this world, Khalu - certainly, Ajjo - O Aryas! Nirgranthanam - Nirgranthas, Va - or, Nirgranthinaam - Nirgranthis, Iriya-Samiyanam - those with Iriya-Samiti, Bhasha-Samiyanam - those with Bhasha-Samiti, Eshana-Samiyanam - those with Eshana-Samiti, Aayana - Aayana (taking), Bhanda - Bhandopkaran, Matra - special vessel, Nikkshevana - Nikkshepana, Samiyanam - those with Samiti, Uccara - excreta, Pasavana - Prasravana, Khel - mouth's dirt, Singhan - nose's dirt, Jalla - sweat's dirt, Parithavaniya - the purification of all these, Samiyanam - those with Samiti, Mana - Samiyanam - those with Mana-Samiti, Vaya - Samiyanam - those with Vachana-Samiti, Kaya - Samiyanam - those with Kaya-Samiti.

Dasha-Shruta-Skandha Sutra
Original Meaning - Aryas! Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira Swami, inviting Shraman Nirgranth and Nirgranthis, said, "O Aryas! Nirgranth and Nirgranthis, who are those with the Erya-Samiti, the Bhasha-Samiti, the Eshana-Samiti, the Adan-Bhand-Matra-Nikshepana-Samiti, the Uccar-Prashravan-Thuk-Nak-Ka-Mal, Prasved-Mal-Ki-Paristhapana-Samiti, the Man-Samiti, the Vak-Samiti, and the Kay-Samiti.
Commentary - Now, focusing on the subject of this Dasha, the Sutrakar says that after the Dharma-Upadesh was completed, Shravan Bhagwan Shri Mahavira Swami himself invited Shraman Nirgranth and Nirgranthis, saying, "O Aryas! Those who have abandoned external and internal possessions, who are tolerant of hardships, who walk after seeing the ground with proof, who take alms after abandoning 42 faults, i.e., those who take alms only through Eshana-Gaveshana, who speak pure and sweet words after abandoning Savadya (faulty) speech, who take and keep Bhand-Upakaran and clothes, etc., who carefully perform the Paristhapana of Purish, Prashravan, and the mouth, nose, and sweat excretions, and - (the connection is with the next Sutra).
In this Sutra, the connection of all the Shashthyanta Visheshans is only with the Muni-Vars who are skilled in mind-motivation and skilled in speaking. Only a person with these qualities is eligible for Samadhi.

## The Fifth Dasha (with Hindi Commentary)

**The Fifth Dasha**

**With Hindi Commentary**

These ten states of mental concentration arise in those who have attained samadhi through the practice of Paushdhik Vrat (fasting) and who are engaged in meditation (on Dharma, etc.). These states are:

**Word-by-word meaning:**

* **Man-Gutti-naan:** Those who have control over their mind
* **Vay-Gutti-naan:** Those who have control over their speech
* **Gutti-ndiaan:** Those who have control over their senses
* **Gutt-Bhambhayari-naan:** Those who have control over their celibacy
* **Ayatti-naan:** Those who are self-interested
* **Ay-hiaan:** Those who benefit their soul
* **Ay-joiin:** Those who control their soul's powers or destroy karmic bonds through the light of their soul
* **Ay-parakkama-naan:** Those who strive for the soul
* **Pakkhiy-Posahiyesu:** Those who attain samadhi through the practice of Paushdhik Vrat at the end of the fortnight
* **Jhiyay-maana-naan:** Those who meditate on Dharma and other auspicious objects

These ten states of mental concentration (**chitt-samadhi-thaanai**), which were previously absent, arise in these monks.

**Meaning:**

Those who have control over their mind, speech, body, and senses; those who practice celibacy; those who are self-interested; those who benefit their soul; those who control their soul's powers; those who strive for the soul; those who practice Paushdhik Vrat; those who attain samadhi through knowledge, vision, etc.; and those who meditate on Dharma and other auspicious objects - these monks experience these ten previously absent states of mental concentration.

**Commentary:**

This sutra is connected to the previous sutra and concludes the aforementioned introduction. For example, those who have control over their mind, speech, and body; those who control their senses like a tortoise; those who practice celibacy in nine ways; those who abandon karmic stains to cross the cycle of existence and enter their true nature; those who benefit their soul by abandoning violence and passions; those who possess the light of their soul to burn the fuel of karma; those who strive for the purity of their soul, abandoning selfish desires and striving only for liberation; those who practice Paushdhik Vrat; those who attain samadhi through knowledge, vision, etc.

## Chapter 138: Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

Those who have attained the samadhi of character and have purified their soul through Dharma-dhyana, etc., excluding the root causes of samadhi, Artha and Raudra dhyana, develop the following ten citta-samadhi-sthana, which were not previously present.

**Fifth Dasha**

The question arises: What is the difference between 'Samiti' and 'Gupti'? The answer is that the restraint of yogas is called Gupti. For example, Manas-samiti means the cessation of the unskillful mind and the inclination towards the skillful mind, but Manogupti means the restraint of both skillful and unskillful minds, as well as the restraint of four types of manoyogas: Satya-manoyog, Asatya-manoyog, Misra-manoyog, and Vyavahar-manoyog. Similarly, one should understand the subject of Vachan-gupti and Kaya-gupti.

In the word "Aay-Joina", if we separate "na" and consider it in the sense of a figure of speech, the remaining part translates to "Atma-yogi" in Sanskrit, which means one who practices Adhyatma yoga, and "Atta-yogi" means one who controls the mind, speech, and body. If we change the reading to "Atma-yogi" in this way, it could also mean one who possesses the best yogas in the practice of restraint.

The meaning of "Paakshik-Paushdha" as it appears in the sutra is as follows: "Pakshe Bhavah Paakshik:". The word "Paksha" here refers to the completion of a fortnight. Due to the extension of the meaning of a word to a part or a whole, the meaning here is "pathya-dana" which complements the fortnight. "Paushdha" means fasting. Alternatively, "Paushdha" refers to the fourteenth and eighth days of the fortnight, so "Paakshik-Paushdha" means fasting on those days. This means those who fast on the fortnightly days. By implication, one should understand the same for Shravaka, etc.

Now, the sutrakar names the ten citta-samadhi-sthana:

Dhamma-chinta va se asampanna-puvva sampannajejjana savvam dhammam janittae; sumina dansane va se asampanna-puvva sampannajejjana ahataccham suminam pasittae, sanni-jai-sarane nam sanni-nanam va se asampanna-puvva sampannajejjana appano poraniyam jai sumaritae; deva-dansane va se asampanna-puvva...

## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

If it arises, then samadhi arises in the mind. If the knowledge of the sign, knowledge, species, and memory, which was not previously born, is born, then by it, remembering its old species, it can attain samadhi. If the samya-bhava, the vision of the gods, is not previously born, then if it arises, then by seeing the chief devarddhi, dev-dyuti, and chief dev-anubhava of the gods, it can attain samadhi. If the knowledge of avadhi is not previously born, then if it arises, then by it, seeing the nature of the loka, the mind can attain samadhi.

## Fifth Dasha

## Commentary

In this sutra, while relying on the vyavahar nay, the places of bhava-samadhi have been described. The root cause of all samadhis is jnana-samadhi, therefore, the sutrakar has first described it. In this anadi and anant samsara-chakra, every being has had to come in the cycle of birth and death countless times, and in every birth, falling under the sway of meaningless anxieties, they have wasted their pure life. Coming into the world, man becomes afflicted by many anxieties, such as: desire-anxiety, enjoyment-anxiety, home-anxiety, business-anxiety, son-anxiety, wife-anxiety, wealth-anxiety, grain-anxiety, relative-anxiety, and friend-anxiety, etc., but his attention does not go towards dharma-anxiety. Therefore, the sutrakar says that if there is no feeling of dharma in the past, and if there is a tendency towards it in the present, then man can know the dharma in the form of shruta and charitra well through that dharma-anxiety.

The question arises: what is the meaning of that dharma word, by thinking about which samadhi is attained? In answer, it is said that that which makes known the real nature of things is called dharma. It is by the knowledge of it that the soul attains the extraordinary bliss; that is called bhava-samadhi. It (dharma) is of many kinds, due to the difference of village, city, nation, etc. First of all, one should know the dharma of production (origin), consumption, and dhrauvya form of every object. After that, one should transform it into the form of heya, jneya, and upadeha, and experience in the mind that because the statement of the omniscient is non-contradictory in the past and future, because it is a good indicator of things, and because it is unparalleled,

## The Fifth Dasha

**With Hindi Commentary**

**1415**

The reason is universally accepted. If one contemplates religion with all these thoughts in mind, the soul will surely attain self-absorption. At the same time, by properly understanding the nature of living and non-living beings, one can use the teachings of the scriptures to benefit oneself and others. Religious knowledge is the root cause of self-absorption, and it cannot be achieved without religious contemplation. Therefore, it is proven that religious contemplation is indeed the root cause of self-absorption.

**(Or)** The word "शब्द" (word) should be understood here as a synonym.

If a monk, while contemplating religion, attains a state of sleep, and in that sleep experiences a different kind of knowledge, i.e., a dream, and in that dream experiences the liberation that gives unparalleled, previously unexperienced, transcendental joy, and as a result, that vision bears true fruit, then the mind attains absorption. In essence, true dream-vision leads to absorption of the mind. However, it should be noted that this absorption can only occur if the dream is like the ten dreams of the great Lord Mahavira, which are the form of liberation. If the dream leads to the attainment of worldly objects and the mind attains absorption, then it is called "भाव-समाधि" (absorption of emotions). Therefore, true dream-vision through religious contemplation is also a major cause of absorption of the mind. _In some places, the reading "सुजाणं" is also found. This means that seeing the good path and having good knowledge are the main causes of absorption._

It seems that people have imagined "inspiration" based on this. In reality, it is this true dream.

The one who undoubtedly attains correct knowledge of the self, i.e., the knowledge of remembering one's birth, remembers their past lives with the help of that knowledge. This remembrance generates a transcendental joy in the mind. Out of "हेतु-वाद" (reasoning), "दृष्टि-वाद" (seeing), and "दीर्घ-कालिक-वाद" (long-term reasoning), it is "दीर्घ-कालिक-वाद" that is the root cause of the knowledge of remembering one's birth. The soul in which the mind arises can remember its past lives through "ईहापोह" (the process of remembering past lives). This calms and pleases your mind, and it embraces detachment and dedicates itself to the welfare of its soul.

## Chapter 5: The Ten Shrutakhanda Sutra

**40**
**142**

If, after the attainment of the knowledge of one's past lives, a being experiences a peaceful vision of the gods, where they can see the radiance of the principal gods, endowed with full powers like divine increase, divine brilliance, divine influence, and the power of creation, their mind attains samadhi. This is because if the form of the gods, as heard from the scriptures, is directly witnessed in samadhi, the mind naturally inclines towards samadhi.

Based on this, many argue that in samadhi, one sees the Lord, but in reality, it is only the vision of the gods. Remember, the vision of the gods is always peaceful and radiant.

The soul that experiences the emergence of samadhi also attains avadhi-jnana (clairvoyance), enabling them to see all worldly objects as if they were in their hand. This brings an extraordinary joy to their soul, and they become absorbed in samadhi once again.

All the fruits mentioned above depend on dharmachinta (reflection on dharma). Therefore, all beings should first engage in dharmachinta. Now, the sutrakar (author of the sutra) describes the remaining five samadhis:

**10.**

* **Ohidasan** (vision of the gods) may arise before the emergence of **asamuppanna-puvve** (knowledge of the future).
* **Man-pajjav-nana** (knowledge of the mind) may arise before the emergence of **asamuppanna-puvve**. This knowledge arises when one understands the mind's nature in the midst of human beings, in the midst of the earth, in the midst of the ocean, and in the midst of the five senses.
* **Kevala-nana** (omniscience) may arise before the emergence of **asamuppanna-puvve**. This knowledge arises when one knows the entire universe.
* **Kevala-dassan** (omniscient vision) may arise before the emergence of **asamuppanna-puvve**. This vision arises when one sees the entire universe.
* **Kevala-maran** (omniscient death) may arise before the emergence of **asamuppanna-puvve**. This death leads to the complete cessation of all suffering.

## The Fifth Stage (Panchami Dasha)

**With Hindi Commentary**

**Avadhi-darshan** (Clairvoyance) or its **asampanna-purva** (non-existent before) arises, then one sees the world through Avadhi-darshan. **Manah-paryav-gyan** (Knowledge of the minds of others) or its **asampanna-purva** arises, then one knows the mental states of all sentient beings with five senses and sufficient karma, within the human realm, the half, the third, and the two islands and oceans. **Kevala-gyan** (Omniscience) or its **asampanna-purva** arises, then one knows the entire universe. **Kevala-darshan** (Omniscient vision) or its **asampanna-purva** arises, then one sees the entire universe. **Kevala-maran** (Omniscient death) or its **asampanna-purva** arises, then one is free from all suffering. || 10 ||

**Word by Word Meaning:**

**Avadhi-darshan** - through Clairvoyance - its **asampanna-purva** - non-existent before - arises - then one sees the world through **Avadhi-darshan**. **Manah-paryav-gyan** - Knowledge of the minds of others - its **asampanna-purva** - non-existent before - arises - then one knows the mental states of all sentient beings with five senses and sufficient karma, within the human realm, the half, the third, and the two islands and oceans. **Kevala-gyan** - Omniscience - its **asampanna-purva** - non-existent before - arises - then one knows the entire universe. **Kevala-darshan** - Omniscient vision - its **asampanna-purva** - non-existent before - arises - then one sees the entire universe. **Kevala-maran** - Omniscient death - its **asampanna-purva** - non-existent before - arises - then one is free from all suffering.

**Meaning:**

When **Avadhi-darshan** arises, one can see the world through it. When **Manah-paryav-gyan** arises, one can know the mental states of all sentient beings with five senses and sufficient karma, within the human realm, the half, the third, and the two islands and oceans. When **Kevala-gyan** arises, one can know the entire universe. When **Kevala-darshan** arises, one can see the entire universe. When **Kevala-maran** arises, one is free from all suffering. This is the tenth **Samadhi-sthana** (stage of meditation).

**Original Meaning:**

When **Avadhi-darshan** arises, one can see the world through it. When **Manah-paryav-gyan** arises, one can know the mental states of all sentient beings with five senses and sufficient karma, within the human realm, the half, the third, and the two islands and oceans. When **Kevala-gyan** arises, one can know the entire universe. When **Kevala-darshan** arises, one can see the entire universe.

Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
Fifth Dasha

It sees. When death occurs with only knowledge, which was not previously present, it is freed from all suffering.

Commentary: This Sutra describes the remaining five samadhis. For example, when the soul develops the ability to see generally, it uses this ability to see all worldly material objects generally. When the soul is endowed with mind-perception knowledge, it knows the mental states of the five-sense-equipped beings who live in the human realm, within the middle of the 2.5 islands and oceans, who are endowed with mind-consciousness. This creates a kind of supernatural joy in the soul, which is called samadhi. If the soul has not previously attained only-knowledge, and if it has not been attained, and if it is attained, then it sees the world and the non-world through that vision, which gives it complete samadhi. The soul has not been able to escape the bondage of birth and death for countless births, but if it dies with only-knowledge, then the soul is freed from all kinds of suffering, which can lead to the attainment of the state of complete bliss, and from this, the attainment of the higher, infinite state. This is the tenth samadhi-state. This is also the best. But a careful observation of these ten states clearly shows that only by thinking about dharma can one attain the state of liberation, because all other states can only occur after that. Therefore, every being should think about dharma to attain self-samadhi.

Now the Sutra-maker describes the aforementioned samadhi-states in verses, saying:

Oyam chittaṃ samādāya jhāṇaṃ samuppaccai. Dhamme ṭhīo avimāṇo nivvāṇamabhigajjhai. || 1 ||
Ojas chittaṃ samādāya dhyānaṃ samutpadyate. Dharme sthito'vimāṇo nirvāṇamabhigajjhati. || 1 ||

Word-by-word meaning: Oyam - pure (free from attachment and aversion) chittaṃ - mind ko samādāya - taking jhāṇaṃ - dharma-meditation etc. samuppaccai - acquires dhamme - in dharma ṭhīo - staying avimāṇo - without doubt nivvāṇam - the state of nirvana abhigajjhai - attains.

Page #213:
---------------------------
## Fifth Stage (Panchami Dasha)

**With Hindi Commentary**

**Original Meaning:** By holding a mind free from attachment and aversion, the soul attains Dharma, meditation, etc., and, being established in doubt-free Dharma, attains the state of liberation (Nirvana).

**Commentary:** Having briefly described the ten stages of Samadhi in prose, the Sutrakar now elaborates on them through verses. This Sutra describes the first stage. The soul whose mind is free from attachment and aversion, and whose mind is pure and clean due to the absence of the effects of passions (Kashaya) and impurities (Kalushya), can attain meditation and, being established in doubt-free Dharma, in the form of both universal and specific activities, attains the state of liberation (Nirvana). Therefore, for Samadhi, one should strive to have a mind free from attachment and aversion.

Now, the Sutrakar speaks about the knowledge of remembering one's own nature (Jati-Smarana-Jnana):

**Verse 2:**

> ण इमं चित्तं समादाय भुज्जो लोयंसि जायइ | अप्पणो उत्तमं ठाणं सन्नि-णाणेण जाणइ ।। २ ।।
> नेदं चित्तं समादाय भूयो लोके जायते ।
> आत्मन उत्तमं स्थानं संज्ञि ज्ञानेन जानाति ।। २ ।।

**Word-by-Word Meaning:** By holding this (imam) kind of (chittam) mind, he (bhujjo) is not (na) born (jayai) again and again (loyansi) in the world (loke), but (kinto) knows (janai) his (appano) own (uttamam) highest (thanam) place with (sanni-nanena) the knowledge of (sanjni) consciousness.

**Original Meaning:** By holding this kind of mind, the soul is not born again and again in the world, and knows its own highest place with the knowledge of consciousness.

**Commentary:** By holding the mind in the form of remembering one's own nature, the soul is not born again in the world of mortals and immobiles, because with the help of this knowledge, firstly, it knows its past births, which have been in the form of consciousness, and secondly, it also knows its own nature of action and the nature of experiencing the fruits of actions.

Page #214:
---------------------------
## 146
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

The highest state for the soul is Samadhi, through which it can attain Shiva-Gati. Samyak-darshan, Samyak-gyan, and Samyak-charitra are also the highest states for the soul. Through these, the soul can attain Nirvana-pad and can know the highest state through the knowledge of jati-smaran. Alternatively, it can know the highest state through knowledge of the pure states among the countless states of restraint.

Now the Sutrakar speaks about the true dream:

**Ahataccam tu suminam khippam paseti samvude |
Savvam va oham tarati dukkha doya vimuccai || 3 ||**

**Yatha tatyam tu svapnam kshipram pasyati samvrata |
Sarvam vougham tarati duhkha dvayena vimucchate || 3 ||**

**Word by word meaning:**

* Ahataccam - Yatha tatyam suminam - true dream
* Samvude - by the restrained soul
* Paseti - sees
* Savvam - all
* Oham - the ocean of samsara
* Khippam - quickly
* Tarati - crosses
* Dukkha doya - two types of suffering
* Vimuccai - gets liberated
* Tu - indicates quick fruition
* Va - alternative

**Meaning:**

The restrained soul, by seeing the true dream, crosses the ocean of samsara and gets liberated from the two types of suffering.

**Fifth Dasha**

Seeing quickly all types, as well as physical and...

**Commentary:**

This Sutra clarifies who sees the true dream and what its result is. The restrained soul (one who controls all the wrong tendencies of the senses and mind) sees the true dream, and its fruit is quickly obtained. By the power of seeing the true dream, the soul, according to the Vyavahar Nay, crosses the ocean of samsara in all ways and is liberated from the eight types of karma-bandhan, including physical and mental suffering.

One might ask if liberation can be achieved through dreams. The answer is that the statement in the Sutra is according to the Vyavahar Nay.

Page #215:
---------------------------
## 80
This is the fifth state (dasha)
With Hindi commentary.
## 147
Only those who have purified their soul through intense penance see such dreams, the fruit of which is the attainment of final liberation (nirvana). Seeing such true dreams leads them to samadhi. To prove this, it is said here that the greatness of seeing true dreams liberates the soul from all sorrows and the vast ocean of samsara. Shri Shraman Bhagwan Mahavir Swami also crossed the ocean of samsara by seeing ten dreams. But remember, such dreams can only come to those who have a closed or controlled soul.
Now the sutrakar speaks about the vision of gods:
"Pantai bhaymanasas vivittam sayanasanam. Appaharasas dantasas deva danseti taino." || 4 ||
"Prantaani bhajamanasya vivittam shayanasanam. Alpaharasya dantasya deva drishyanta tayinah." || 4 ||
## Word by word meaning:
Pantai - those who fear (eating) the last remaining food, bhaymanasas - those who consume, vivittam - free from women, animals, and eunuchs, sayanasanam - those who use beds and seats, appaharasas - those who eat little, dantasas - those who control their senses, taino - those who protect the six-bodied beings, deva - gods, danseti - give vision.
## Main meaning:
Those who eat little (alpa), those who eat the last remaining (pranta) food, those who use beds and seats free from women, animals, and eunuchs, those who control their senses, and those who protect the six-bodied beings, they see the gods.
## Commentary:
This sutra clarifies that those ascetics who eat bland and old grains, who eat little, who control their five senses and mind, who use beds and seats free from women, animals, and eunuchs, and who protect the six-bodied beings, they can see the gods. The muni who is calm-minded, intelligent, and possesses the qualities of gravity and all the aforementioned qualities, he is blessed by the divine power with his own powers.

---------------------------
## Chapter 148: The Dasha-Shrutskandha Sutra, Fifth Dasha

This chapter discusses the auspicious fruits of penance and self-restraint. It describes how deities perform dances and other actions in front of those who practice these virtues. This leads to a state of samadhi (meditation) and joy in the mind. The reason for this is that when one witnesses what is described in scriptures about deities, the mind naturally inclines towards them and attains samadhi. Therefore, it is established that anyone desiring to see deities must first possess all the aforementioned qualities. It is universally accepted that the attainment of the desired result is possible only when the necessary means are present. 

Many people have imagined the vision of the Bhagavan (the Supreme Being) and Ishvara (God) based on this concept of samadhi. However, it is actually the vision of deities.

While translating the Sanskrit text, it would have been better to translate the second pada as "vivikta-shayanasana" (isolated resting place), but we have only provided a literal translation here. Similarly, readers should be aware of such instances elsewhere in the text.

Now, the sutrakar (author of the sutras) describes the subject of avadhi-jnana (clairvoyance):

**"Savva-kaam-virattass khamano bhay-bheravam. Tao se ohi bhavahi sanjayass tavassinoo." (5)**

**"Sarva-kaam-viratasy kshamanasy bhay-bhairave. Tatasyavadhirbhavati samyatasy tapasvinah." (5)**

**Word-by-word meaning:**

* Savva - all
* Kaam - desires
* Virattass - those who have renounced
* Khamano - those who endure
* Bhay-bheravam - terrifying dangers (sudden calamities, hunger, thirst, etc.)
* Tao - therefore
* Se - from
* Ohi - that
* Bhavahi - becomes
* Sanjayass - those who are constantly restrained
* Tavassinoo - those who practice penance

**Meaning:**

Those who have renounced all desires for sensual pleasures, who endure terrifying dangers, who constantly practice restraint and penance, they attain avadhi-jnana (clairvoyance).

**Commentary:**

This sutra states that the person who has renounced the five sensual pleasures of form, taste, smell, touch, and sound, which are connected to this world and the next, and who endures all hardships, attains avadhi-jnana.

Page #217:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Stage (Panchami Dasha)

**With Hindi Commentary**

One who has abandoned desires, who endures the most severe hardships, who tolerates divine afflictions (upasarga), who practices all seventeen types of restraint (samyama) with complete dedication, who engages in twelve types of austerities (tapa), and who is constantly striving, attains **Avadhi-Jnana** (clairvoyance). Through this Avadhi-Jnana, they perceive all material objects in the world, and their mind becomes filled with the peaceful bliss of Samadhi (meditation). However, it is crucial to remember that only an individual possessing these qualities can attain Avadhi-Jnana and the Samadhi that arises from it. Therefore, one should strive diligently to cultivate these qualities.

Now, the Sutrakar (author of the sutras) describes the subject of Avadhi-Darshan (clairvoyance):

**Tavasā Avahattule'ssassa Daṇsaṇam Parisujjhai |
Uḍḍham Ahe Tiriyaṁ Ca Savvam Anupassati || 6 ||**

**Translation:**

**Tavasā -** Through austerity (tapa), **Avahattu-le'ssassa -** of one who has destroyed or removed the dark (krishna) and other inauspicious blemishes (leshya), **Daṇsaṇam -** Avadhi-Darshan (clairvoyance), **Parisujjhai -** becomes pure (nirmal), and then **Uḍḍham -** the upper realms (urdha-lok), **Ahe -** the lower realms (adho-lok), **Ca -** and **Tiriyaṁ -** the realms of the transmigrating beings (tiryak-lok), **Savvam -** all, **Anupassati -** they perceive.

**Meaning:**

One who has eradicated inauspicious blemishes through austerity attains pure Avadhi-Darshan. With this clairvoyance, they can perceive all beings and objects in the upper, lower, and transmigrating realms.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra states that when an individual purifies their soul by removing dark and other inauspicious blemishes through austerity, their Avadhi-Darshan becomes pure. With this pure vision, they can perceive the true nature of all beings and objects in the upper, lower, and transmigrating realms.

## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Fifth Dasha

It becomes visible because the 'darshan' of the soul naturally becomes pure when the karma that obscures the 'avdhi-darshan' is removed.

This sutra clearly shows that the soul becomes pure only by removing the inauspicious leshyas and purifying the self through tapas.

Now the sutrakar describes the subject of manah-paryav-gyan:

**"Susamahiele-ssass-avitt-akass-bhikkhuno. Savvato vippamukkass-aya jaanai pajjave."** || 7 ||

**"Susamahit-leshyasya avitarkasya bhikshoh. Sarvato vippramuktasya atma janati paryavan."** || 7 ||

**Paddarthanvaya:** - "Susamahiele-ssass" - who is holding the well-established auspicious leshyas, "avitt-akass" - does not desire the fruit, "bhikkhuno" - sustains himself by begging, and "savvato" - in all ways "vippamukkass" - free from bonds, "aya" - the soul "pajjave" - knows the "jaanai" - the paryayas of the mind.

**Mulaarth:** - The soul who holds auspicious leshyas, has a steady mind, sustains himself by begging, and is free from all bonds, can know the paryayas (successive states or transformations) of the mind. That is, only he can have manah-paryav-gyan.

**Teeka:** - This sutra describes that the soul who has tejas, padma, and shukla leshyas in his emotions, who has a steady and firm faith, who is free from all bonds, and who sustains himself by begging, can have manah-paryav-gyan, which allows him to know the paryayas of the mind. This also clearly shows that only the soul whose inner self has auspicious (tejas, padma, and shukla) leshyas can have samyak gyan, darshan, charitra, and tapas related samadhi. The soul who experiences the aforementioned samadhi can gain manah-paryav-gyan samadhi.

Page #219:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Stage

**With Hindi Commentary**

**151**

One might wonder what the meaning of the word "Avitarka" is. The solution states that "Tarka" refers to reasoning (investigation-doubt). One whose mind is free from doubt and has attained firm faith, or whose mind is devoid of worldly (related to this world) and otherworldly (related to the other world) desires, i.e., the soul who does not desire happiness related to both worlds, is called "Avitarka". Alternatively, the second stage of Shukla-Dhyana is called "Avitarka". The sage who practices this meditation is called "Avitarka". The "Ardha-Magadhi-Kosh" defines its meaning based on the following etymology:

"Avitarka - there is no "Vitarka" (reasoning), the fruit of disbelief and action is the body form of the mendicant, he is "Avitarka", i.e., the sage free from false reasoning is called "Avitarka".

Now the Sutrakar describes the subject of pure knowledge:

"Jaya se Naanavaranam Savvam Hoi Khayam Gayam. Tao Logamalogam Cha Jino Janati Kevali." || 8 ||

"Yada Tasyan Gnanavaranam Sarvam Bhavati Kshayam Gatam. Tato Lokamalochancha Jino Janati Kevali." || 8 ||

**Word by Word Meaning:**

Jaya - when - that Muni's Naanavaranam - knowledge-obscuring karma Savvam - all types Khayam Gayam - destroyed - Hoi - becomes Tao - then Logamalogam Cha - both the world and the other world Jino - the Jina Bhagavan Kevali - as a Kevali Janati - knows.

**Literal Meaning:**

When the Muni's knowledge-obscuring karma is completely destroyed, at that time he, as the Jina Bhagavan or Kevali, knows both the world and the other world.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra states that when the aforementioned virtuous Muni's knowledge-obscuring, perception-obscuring, delusion-causing, and hindrance karmas are all destroyed, he becomes the Jina Bhagavan and due to possessing pure knowledge, he is called "Kevali". Then, through his knowledge, he knows both the world and the other world.

Page #220:
---------------------------
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra, Fifth Dasha

**It is said that when all karmas are destroyed, the being becomes omniscient and knows all tangible and intangible substances. In addition, they become immersed in the state of pure knowledge, which is immutable.**

**Now the Sutrakar speaks about the subject of pure vision:**

**"When the darshanavaran of a muni is completely destroyed, then the Jina, the Kevali, sees both the Lok and the Alok." (6)**

**Word by word meaning:**

* **Jaya:** When
* **Darshanavaran:** The darshanavaran karma of the muni
* **Savvam:** All
* **Khayam Gayam:** Destroyed
* **Tao:** Then
* **Jino:** The Jina
* **Kevali:** The Kevali
* **Logamalogam:** The Lok and the Alok
* **Pasati:** Sees

**Meaning:** When the darshanavaran karma of a muni is completely destroyed, then the Jina, the Kevali, sees both the Lok and the Alok.

**Commentary:** In this Sutra, the Sutrakar describes the all-seeing one, saying that when the darshanavaran karma of a virtuous muni is completely destroyed, then that muni becomes the Jina and, with the help of pure vision, sees the Lok and the Alok as clearly as the palm of their hand. The only difference between knowledge and vision is that vision is a general understanding, while knowledge is a specific understanding. When both are attained, the soul becomes omniscient and all-seeing. As a result, they become capable of knowing and seeing all tangible and intangible substances, and from this, they attain complete samadhi.

**Now the Sutrakar again describes the same subject:**

**"When the mohanijjam karma is completely destroyed in the pure padma, then the being sees the Lok and the Alok without any obstruction." (10)**

Page #221:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Stage

**With Hindi Commentary**

**153**

**Verse 10:**

When the **mohaniya karma** (karma that binds to the world) is destroyed in the pure **pratima** (vow), the **sushmahitha** (perfectly concentrated) soul sees all **loka** (worlds) and **aloka** (non-worlds).

**Word by Word Meaning:**

* **Padimae** - in the **pratima**
* **Pratijna ke visuddhae** - in the pure vow
* **Mohanija** - **mohaniya karma**
* **Khayam gayam** - destroyed
* **Sushmahiye** - perfectly concentrated
* **Ase-sam** - all
* **Loka** - worlds
* **Loka cha** - and
* **A-loka** - non-worlds
* **Paseti** - sees

**Meaning:**

When the vow is purified and the **mohaniya karma** is destroyed, the perfectly concentrated soul sees all worlds and non-worlds.

**Commentary:**

This sutra describes the all-seeing vision that arises from the destruction of **mohaniya karma**. For example, a muni who has perfectly followed the twelve vows of a sadhu, including the monthly vows, and who has remained steadfast in their sadhu attire and all their rules, or who has diligently practiced the five great vows, will have completely destroyed their **mohaniya karma**. This will lead them to a state of **charitra-samadhi** (concentration through conduct), allowing them to see all worlds and non-worlds. The emergence of **mohaniya karma** hinders the ability to see everything. When it is completely destroyed, the soul will inevitably become all-seeing. However, it is important to remember that to become all-seeing, one must diligently follow the twelve vows of a sadhu and the five great vows with pure determination.

**Verse 11:**

Just as the base of a tree falls when pierced by a needle on the head, so too, when **mohaniya karma** is destroyed, the remaining karma is destroyed.

**Word by Word Meaning:**

* **Jaha** - just as
* **Matthay** - on the head
* **Su-iye** - by a needle
* **Hantae** - pierced
* **Hamm-ai** - falls
* **Tala** - base of the tree
* **Evam** - so too
* **Kammani** - karma
* **Hamm-anti** - are destroyed
* **Mohanije** - **mohaniya karma**
* **Khayam gaye** - destroyed

**Meaning:**

Just as the base of a tree falls when pierced by a needle on the head, so too, when **mohaniya karma** is destroyed, the remaining karma is destroyed.

Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
Fifth Dasha
Mulaartha- Just as a palm tree falls down when cut with a sharp weapon at the top, in the same way, all the remaining karmas are destroyed when the mohaniya karma is destroyed.
Tika- This sutra states that all the remaining karmas are destroyed when one mohaniya karma is destroyed.  Illustrating the subject with an analogy, the sutrakar says that just as a palm tree is completely destroyed by being cut with a sharp weapon like a needle at the top, in the same way, the remaining karmas like jnanaavaraneya and antaraya, etc., are destroyed when the primary mohaniya karma is destroyed.
If one wants to interpret the first part of the shloka as meaning that the palm tree loses its treehood when its leaves are cut like needles, it does not seem right. The only thing to be shown is that the palm tree is destroyed when its main part is cut with a weapon, etc., only then can the analogy be valid.
Just as all the remaining limbs, soul and life-breath become void when the head of a human being is cut off, and the whole tree falls down when the root of the tree is cut off, in the same way, all the remaining karmas are destroyed immediately when the mohaniya (ignorance) karma is destroyed. The word "suchi" here refers to a sharp weapon like a needle.
The sutrakar again describes the same subject:
Senavati mi nihate jaha sena panassati. Evam kammani nassanti mohanijje khayam gaye. || 12 ||
Senapatou nihate yatha sena pranasyati. Evam karmani nasyanti mohaniye kshayam gate. || 12 ||
Padarthanvaya- Jaha- like Senavati mi- when the commander is nihate- killed, Sena- the army panassati- is destroyed, evam- in the same way, mohanijje- when the mohaniya karma is khayam gaye- destroyed, kammani- the remaining karmas nassanti- are destroyed.

Page #223:

## Fifth Dasha

**With Hindi Commentary**

**Original Meaning:** Just as an entire army flees when its commander is killed, similarly, when the mohaniya karma is destroyed, all other karmas are destroyed.

**Commentary:** This sutra also explains the previous topic using an analogy, as in the previous sutras. Just as in a battle, when the commander is killed, the rest of the army is destroyed, meaning they flee the battlefield, similarly, when the mohaniya karma is destroyed, the rest of the karma group is also destroyed. These examples prove that mohaniya karma is the most important of all karmas. When it is destroyed, the rest of the karmas are easily destroyed. Therefore, one should first try to destroy this karma.

The sutrakar further describes the same topic:

**"Just as a fire without smoke is extinguished when it runs out of fuel, similarly, karmas are extinguished when the mohaniya karma is destroyed."**

**Word by Word Meaning:** Just as - that (used here to show fame, meaning the well-known fire) - fire - without fuel - is extinguished - similarly - when the mohaniya karma - is destroyed - the rest of the karmas - are destroyed.

**Original Meaning:** Just as a fire without smoke is extinguished due to lack of fuel, similarly, when the mohaniya karma is destroyed, all other karmas are also destroyed.

**Commentary:** Similar to the previous sutras, this sutra also explains the previous topic using an analogy. The sutrakar says that just as a fire without smoke is extinguished due to lack of fuel, similarly, karmas are extinguished when the mohaniya karma is destroyed.

## 156
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

Just as a dry root, even when watered, does not sprout, similarly, when the Mohaniya Karma is destroyed, the remaining Karmas do not sprout. This is because Mohaniya Karma is the primary Karma, and when the primary is destroyed, the secondary cannot exist.

The Sutrakar further explains the same topic:

**Sukka - Mule Jaha Rukkha Sinchamane Na Rohati.**
**Evam Kamma Na Rohanti Mohanije Khayam Gaye.** || 14 ||

**Just as a dry-rooted tree does not sprout even when watered, similarly, Karmas do not sprout when the Mohaniya Karma is destroyed.** || 14 ||

**Fifth Dasha**

**Pardarth Anvaya:** Jaha - Just as Sukka - Mule - Dry-rooted Rukkha - Tree Sinchamane - When watered Na Rohati - Does not sprout again, Evam - Similarly, Mohanije - When the Mohaniya Karma Khayam Gaye - Is destroyed, Kamma - The remaining Karmas also Na Rohanti - Do not arise.

**Mulaarth:** Just as a dry tree does not sprout when watered, similarly, other Karmas do not arise when the Mohaniya Karma is destroyed.

**Teeka:** In this Sutra, the Sutrakar has also used an analogy. Just as a tree, when its root is dry, does not sprout again even when watered, similarly, when the Mohaniya Karma is completely destroyed, other Karmas do not arise. Because birth, death, and progeny in the world are caused by the Mohaniya Karma. When the root is destroyed, the sprout of existence will never arise.

Therefore, one should always cultivate the causes of destruction of Mohaniya Karma, such as Samyak Jnana, Samyak Darshan, etc.

The Sutrakar further explains the same topic:

**Jaha Daddhana Beeyana Na Jayanti Pun Ankura. Kamma - Beeyesu Daddhesu Na Jayanti Bhavan Kura.** || 15 ||

**Just as strong seeds do not sprout, similarly, strong Karma-seeds do not sprout into the sprout of existence.** || 15 ||

## The Fifth Stage

**With Hindi Commentary**

**Verse 15:**

Just as burnt seeds do not sprout again, so too, when the seeds of karma are burnt, the sprouts of existence do not arise.

**Word-by-word meaning:**

* Jaha - Just as
* Daddhanaam - Burnt
* Beejaanaam - Seeds
* Pun - Again
* Ankuraah - Sprouts
* Na Jaayanti - Do not arise
* Issi Prakaar - In the same way
* Karma - Karma
* Beejeshu - In the seeds
* Daddheshu - When burnt
* Bhavaankuraah - Sprouts of existence
* Na Jaayanti - Do not arise

**Meaning:**

Just as burnt seeds do not produce sprouts, similarly, when the seeds of karma are burnt, the sprouts of birth and death cannot arise.

**Commentary:**

This sutra uses an analogy to explain that liberated souls do not experience rebirth. Just as burnt seeds cannot sprout, similarly, when the seeds of karma are burnt, the sprouts of birth and death cannot arise. Liberation is not the result of any particular karma, but rather the result of the destruction of karma. Karma is the sole reason why the soul is trapped in the cycle of existence. If this root cause (karma) is eradicated, the soul will enter its own true nature and attain Nirvana without a doubt. Therefore, one should always strive to destroy the seeds of karma to free oneself from worldly pleasures, sorrows, fears, and anxieties.

**Note:**

The use of the sixth case ending "daddhanaam" instead of the fifth case ending "daddhebyah" in the sutra "daddhebyah beejeshyah panchami" further emphasizes that the soul is not inherently trapped in the cycle of existence, but rather gets caught in it due to the influence of karma.

**The Sutra-kar now describes the final stage of Samadhi:**

**Verse 16:**

**Original:**

* चिच्चा ओरालियं बोंदि नाम-गोयं च केवली ।
* आउयं वेयणिज्जं च छित्ता भवति नीरए ।। १६ ।।

**Translation:**

* Having abandoned the bond of attachment, the name, the lineage, and the state of being a Kevali,
* The lifespan, the feeling of existence, and the mind are all cut off, becoming like a lotus in water.

**Original:**

* त्यक्त्वौदारिकं बोंदिं नाम गोत्रं च केवली ।
* आयुष्कं वेदनीयं च छित्त्वा भवति नीरजः ।। १६ ।।

**Translation:**

* Having abandoned the bond of attachment, the name, the lineage, and the state of being a Kevali,
* The lifespan, the feeling of existence, and the mind are all cut off, becoming like a lotus in water.

**With Hindi Commentary**

**- Knowledge and**

**Word-by-word meaning:** Auso - O, auspicious disciple! Evam - thus, Abhisamagamm - knowing, Chittam - (mind free from attachment and aversion), Antahkaranam - inner being, Aadaya - taking, Dharan - holding, Seni-Sudhidarshan - pure series of pure vision, Uvagamm - attaining, Aaya - comes, Atma - soul, Suddhi-Suddhi - purity-purity, Uvagai-Pra - attaining, Tti - thus, Bem - I say, Iti - thus, Panchama - fifth, Dasha - Dasha, Samatta - completed.

**Meaning:** O, auspicious disciple! Thus, knowing (the different types of Samadhi), holding the mind free from attachment and aversion, and attaining the pure series, the soul attains purity, meaning it attains the state of liberation.

**Commentary:** This Sutra concludes the Dasha presented in it. In conclusion, addressing the disciple, it is said, "O, auspicious disciple! One should hold the mind free from attachment and aversion and attain self-purification, because attachment and aversion are the main obstacles to self-purification. If these two are removed from the inner being, the soul will automatically become pure. In addition, one should know well the aforementioned ten types of Samadhi-sthana, and by seeing their nature through knowledge, one should attain self-purification through knowledge, vision, and conduct.

The word 'Chittam' also means knowledge, so pure Chittam means self-purification through knowledge.

The Sutra states that by attaining the pure series, the soul attains purity. Two types of series are described: Dravya-Shreni and Bhava-Shreni. Dravya-Shreni refers to the series of steps built for ascending a palace, etc. Bhava-Shreni is again of two types: Vishuddha Bhava-Shreni and Avisuddha Bhava-Shreni. Through the Avisuddha Bhava-Shreni, the soul wanders in the cycle of Samsara, and through the Vishuddha Bhava-Shreni, it goes towards liberation. Therefore, only the Vishuddha Bhava-Shreni can remove the karmic impurities. The Sutra also states, "Akdevar Seni Musia," etc. Therefore, it is proven that the pure series can remove karmic impurities, and by becoming pure from them, the soul attains the state of liberation.

The conclusion of the entire Sutra is that one should first thoroughly understand the nature of the ten Samadhi-sthana, then purify knowledge, perception and conduct through them, and with the help of श्रेणि-शुद्धि, attain self-purification. Upon attaining purification, the soul attains the state of liberation.
Thus, Shri Sudharma Swami Ji says to his disciple Jambu Swami Ji, "O disciple! Just as I heard the meaning of this Dasha from the mouth of Shri Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira Swami, so have I spoken to you, but I have not said anything from my own intellect."

## Sixth Stage

The fifth stage described the ten samadhis. Achieving samadhi is essential for everyone in the world. Achieving samadhi through the life of a monk is the best, but it is not possible for everyone to achieve samadhi through the life of a monk. In the world, there are many people who cannot adopt the life of a monk due to lack of practice, so it is appropriate for them to achieve samadhi through the life of a lay follower. In this sixth stage, the sutra-maker describes the eleven vows (pratimaa) of a lay follower, keeping in mind the fifth stage. This is also its subject.

These vows are also called Upasaka-pratimaa. One who sits near the monks with the desire to listen to the Dharma is called an Upasaka, as in "One who sits near the monks with the desire to listen to the Dharma is called an Upasaka." Upasakas are of four types based on their substance, purpose, delusion, and feeling. Their characteristics are as follows:

1. **Dravya-Upasaka:** One whose body is fit to be an Upasaka, who has bound the karma of being an Upasaka in the past life, and whose name, lineage, etc. karma have come to the fore in the present life.
2. **Tad-artha-Upasaka:** One who desires to obtain something. This desire is of three types based on the object of desire: sentient, non-sentient, and mixed. Sentient desire is also of two types: bipedal and quadrupedal. The desire for a son, friend, wife, and servant, etc. is called bipedal, and the desire for cows, etc. is called quadrupedal.

Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
Sixth Dasha
'Chatushpad' is called desire. The gist is that a person who desires worldly things and beings like sons, friends, wealth, grain, and cows, and worships for their attainment is called a Tadarthopaasak.
3. Mohopaasak - One who worships young men and women to satisfy their lust, obeys each other blindly, and sacrifices their lives out of attachment if they don't get each other, are Mohopaasaks. 363 Hypocrites are Mohopaasaks. Such people cannot see the truth due to the rise of Mohaniya Karma, therefore they become engrossed in false vision and make it their principle. They consider the worship of this principle as everything. This is their heaven, this is their liberation (Moksha).
4. Bhavopaasak - One who worships a Shraman who is endowed with knowledge, vision, and character with right vision and auspicious quantities is called a Bhavopaasak. The worship of a Shraman is done only for his qualities, just as the worship of a cow is for milk. Bhavopaasak is also called Shramanopaasak and Shravak. One who listens to and speaks about Dharma is called a Shravak, like - "Shrunoti Shravayati Va Shravakah."
Here the question arises that if one who listens and speaks is called a Shravak, then are Ganadhar and other Sadhus also Shravaks, because they also listen to the words from the mouth of Shri Bhagwan and preach Dharma to their disciples and the public, or can the whole world be Shravaks because everyone in it always listens and speaks something. In reply, it is said that if the general compound meaning of the word 'Shravak' is taken, then it can be used for Ganadhar and other Sadhus like householders, but here this word is Yog-Ruddha which is used only for householders who listen to and speak Dharma. Just as the word 'Gau' - "Gachchati-iti Gau" from this etymology can be used for all moving creatures, but due to being Yog-Ruddha in a particular individual, it refers to that only.
The scriptures have propounded two types of Dharma - Anangaar and Grihastha. Among them, the word Shravak has been used only for Grihastha. A real Shravak is usually...

Page #231:
---------------------------
## Sixth Stage
**With Hindi Language Commentary**

One who is always eager to listen to Dharma (religious teachings) and follows the path of an ascetic (anagār) can attain the state of a Kevali (liberated being).

**163**

Although a Sadhu (ascetic) can also be called a Shravak (listener) because of their practice of listening to Dharma, their listening is complete (paripūrṇa) while a householder's listening is incomplete (aparipūrṇa). Therefore, to distinguish between the two types of listeners, the term Shravak has been established for the householder listener. The following passage from the Bhagavati Sutra clearly shows that according to the Vyavahar Nay (practical viewpoint), the terms Shravak and Upasak are used only for householders: "Kevali's Shravak or Kevali's Shravika, Kevali's Upasak or Kevali's Upasika, Sadhu's Shravak or Sadhu's Shravika, Sadhu's Upasak or Sadhu's Upasika." One who is eager to listen to Dharma is called a Shravak.

Now the question arises: what is the difference between a Shravak and an Upasak? The answer is that the term Shravak is used in the scriptures for Avritti-Samyak Drishti (right faith) and the term Upasak is used for Desh-Vritti (right conduct). For example, in the Upasak-Dasang-Sutra, it is said that a householder who observes the twelve vows of a householder is called an Upasak: "Samanovasaya jae" (Shramanopasako jatah) meaning he has become a Shramanopasak, not a Shravak. But where the term Shravak is mentioned, there is the sutra "Dansan-Savae (Darshan-Shravaka)" meaning a person who holds Samyak Darshan (right vision) is a Darshan-Shravak. This is the difference between the two.

One might wonder what the meaning of the word "Pratima" is. The answer is: "Rajoharan-Mukhapotikādi-Dravyaling-Dharitvam-Pratimatvam." This Pratima is of two types: Dravya (material) and Bhava (spiritual). Wearing Rajoharan (a kind of cloth worn by ascetics), Mukhapotika (a cloth tied over the mouth), etc., is Dravya-Pratima, and adopting the qualities of an ascetic is called Bhava-Pratima. The meaning of Pratima is resemblance, therefore, adopting the physical characteristics and qualities similar to an ascetic is Upasak Pratima. In the present stage, both Dravya and Bhava types of Pratima are described. The term "Upasak-Pratima" is used here with the aim of understanding the meaning of resemblance. By studying the Pratima of an Upasak in this stage, everyone will easily understand the difference between an Upasak and a Shraman. The difference between the two lies only in their qualities.

_ The word "Pratima" means "Abhigraha" which also means "Pratijna". The type of "Pratijna" that is in a particular "Pratima" will be described in its proper place. All this has been described according to Syadvad, which is beneficial in both worlds. This is also called Jain Van-Prasth.
The words "Shravak" and "Upasak" are also found in Buddhism. There, "Shravak" is used for a Sadhu and "Upasak" is used for a Grihastha. _ Now the Sutrakar begins the Dasha, saying:

Original meaning: O venerable disciple! I have heard that the Bhagavan has stated that in this Jina-shastra, the venerable elders have established eleven images of the devotee. The disciple asked, O Bhagavan! Which eleven images of the devotee have the venerable elders established? The Guru replied that the eleven images of the devotee that will be mentioned have been established by the venerable elders, such as:

Commentary: In this sutra, similar to the initial sutras of the previous chapters, it is stated in the form of a question and answer between Shri Sudha and his disciple Shri Jambu Swami that there are eleven images of the devotee. The rest of the description is the same as before.

These eleven images lead the devotees towards samadhi, therefore they are completely worthy of acceptance. Through them, the actions of the Jain vanaprastha can be well achieved.

Now, the sutrakar begins the subject of the chapter, first describing the subject of the darshan-pratima, because with its existence, the remaining images can be easily achieved: _Akirya-vai yaavi bhavai, nahiya-vai, nahiya-panne, nahiya-ditti, no sammvai, no nitiya-vai, nasanti paraloga-vai, natthi ihloae, natthi paraloae, natthi maya, natthi piya, natthi arihanta, natthi chakkavatti, natthi baldeva, natthi vasudeva, natthi niraya, natthi neraiya, natthi sukkad-dukkadanam phal-vitti-viseso, no succinna kamm succinna phala bhavanti, no duccinna kamm duccinna phala bhavanti aphale kallana pavae, no paccayati jiva, natthi niraya, natthi siddha, se evam vadi evam-panne evam-ditti evam-chanda-raga-mati-nivite yaavi bhavai._

It is the opposite of the stability of substances, it does not believe in this world and the other world, it says that this world is not, the other world is not, there is no mother, no father, no Arihant, no Chakravarti, no Baladeva, no Vasudeva, no Narakiya, there is no fruit of good and bad karmas, there are no good fruits of good karmas and bad fruits of bad karmas, there is no fruit of welfare and sin, the soul does not take birth in the other world, there is no place from hell to moksha, it says like this, this is its knowledge and vision, in this way it has established its opinions in attachment, that is, its intellect is situated in the above subjects.
Commentary - In this sutra, the vision of Mithya-darshana (false belief) is described, because without the knowledge of Mithya-darshana, the devotee cannot attain Samyag-darshana (right belief). Knowledge of Mithya-darshana is necessary before Samyag-darshana, so it is appropriate and justified to describe it here first. Mithya-darshana is the complete opposite of Samyag-darshana, with its help the knowledge of Samyag-darshana can easily be obtained. There are two types of Mithya-darshana - Abhigrahika and Anabhigrahika. Adhering to Mithya-darshana stubbornly or forcefully is Abhigrahika Mithya-darshana, and the common Mithya-darshana of conscious and unconscious beings is called Anabhigrahika Mithya-darshana. The author describes it in this way:
Kriya-vada is the name of Astika-vada. This is Samyag-darshana, and denying the existence of substances like Jiva etc. is Nastika-vada, which is Mithya-darshana. In Akriya-vada, there are both Bhavya (capable of liberation) and Abhavya (incapable of liberation) individuals, but in Kriya (Astika) vada, there are only Bhavya souls. Some of them are also Shukla Pakshika, because they will attain Siddha gati within the Utkrista-Ardha-Paravartana. But even such individuals, due to being Samsari for a long time, sometimes enter Akriya-vada for some time. At that time, they establish their doctrine that the soul is not a substance at all. Except for the five elements, there is no divine power in the world,

Page #236:
---------------------------
## 168
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Sixth Dasha
H

Therefore, there is no divine power in this world or the next world, therefore there is no such entity in this world or the next world.
They do not believe in virtue, sin, or this world. For example, "Nasti paraloke matiyasy iti nastikaḥ" - the origin of the word "nastika" also reveals this. Meaning, one who does not have a mind in the next world is called a nastika. All their senses are inclined towards nastika-vada. They do not understand even liberation. For them, there is no mother, no father. They do not believe in Arhant, Chakravarti, Baldev, Vasudev, hell, hellish beings, and the fruits of good and bad deeds, because they have made up their mind that there is no substance other than the five elements. They do not believe in a doer and an enjoyer, therefore, the specific fruits of sin and virtue are also not for them, consequently, they cannot attain those fruits. For them, there is no fruit of good deeds like penance, restraint, and celibacy, nor of evil deeds like violence. They believe that after death, the soul is not born in the next world, and there are no special places from hell to liberation. According to their opinion, there is no righteous king.

By fixing their mind in this nastika-vada, they remain engrossed in their principles mentioned above. This is called a complete kadagrahi. Now the sutrakar says that this intellect of theirs is not beneficial but sinful. The purpose of describing them here is only that when the devotee enters the astika-vada, they should also have a good understanding of nastika-vada. Along with this, it is also necessary to know what the result of believing in nastika-vada is in this world and the next world. A nastika-vadi becomes a complete kadagrahi due to the wrong belief of abhigrahika.

In this chapter, in many places, "atthi" is used in the singular instead of the plural, and "santi" is used in the singular instead of the plural. This is not a fault due to the Prakrit language, because in Prakrit, there is often a change in the number.

Now, in the following sutra, the sutrakar describes how the soul, with a wrong view, becomes inclined towards the five asravas:

From this, there is a desire for greatness, a great beginning, a great attachment, ego, egotism, ego-serving, ego-thinking, ego-desire, ego-attachment.

**Word by Word Meaning:**

He - that person, **nastika** - atheist, **mahechche** - with excessive desire, **maharambha** - one who starts great (work), **maha-pariggahe** - one with excessive possessions, **ahmmie** - one who performs unrighteous actions, **ahmmmaanue** - follower of unrighteousness (one who believes in it), **ahmm-sevee** - one who serves unrighteousness, **ahmmittte** - one for whom unrighteousness is dear (favorite), **ahmm-kkhai** - famous in unrighteousness, **ahmm-raagee** - one who has affection for unrighteousness, **ahmm-paljjanee** - one who generates unrighteousness, **ahmm-sheel samudayaaree** - one who holds unrighteous conduct and character, **bhavathi** - becomes, **cha** - and then, **ahmmeṇam cheva** - through unrighteousness only, **vittim kappemane** - earning a livelihood, **viharai** - lives.

He is an atheist, with excessive desire, one who starts great (work), one with excessive possessions (wealth, grain, land, etc.), unrighteous, follower of unrighteousness, one who serves unrighteousness, one for whom unrighteousness is dear, famous in unrighteousness, one who has affection for unrighteousness, one who sees unrighteousness, one who earns a livelihood through unrighteousness, one who strives for unrighteousness, and one who holds unrighteous conduct and character. He lives earning his livelihood through unrighteousness.

**Commentary:**

This sutra describes the state of a person who becomes an atheist. His situation becomes unstable. He starts desiring great things like kingdoms. His desires increase day by day. He does not hesitate to commit great evils like violence, but rather, he is inclined towards them. Due to excessive possessions (wealth, grain, etc.), his desires increase, and then he becomes a staunch atheist...

The translation preserving the Jain terms is as follows:

"He who approves of adharma (unrighteousness) at every place, consequently becomes a follower of adharma. He completely abandons the dharma of shruta (scriptural knowledge) and charitra (right conduct), and makes adharma his own dear one, and remains constantly engaged in serving it. He sees only adharma and starts praising it. He considers adharma as his conduct, behavior, and everything, and carries on his livelihood by it. His tendency becomes that of defaming dharma and establishing his influence over people.

The entire phrase "adharma-prajnaka" given in the sutra means: "He who greatly generates adharma among the people - the adharma-prajnaka (generator of adharma)! Somewhere the reading 'adhamm-palajjane' is also seen, wherein he greatly delights - gets attached to adharma-predominant karmas (actions). The letter 'l' is substituted for 'r' here."

The meaning of 'adharma-prajnaka' is: "He who generates adharma in the world."

Sixth stage:
Thus, the conclusion is that the nastika (non-believer) makes his life sinful. He abandons good conduct and indulges in misconduct.

Further, the description of the condition of the nastika is given in the following sutra:

"Hana, chinda, bhinda, vikartaka, lohita-pani, cande, rudde, khuddhe, asamikkhiyakari, sahassie, ukkancana, vancana, mai, niyadi, kudamai, sai-sampayoga-bahule, dussile duppariccae, ducariye, duranunnea, duvvae, duppattianande, nissile nivvae, niggune, nimmere, nipaccakkhana-posahopavase, asahu."

(The nastika is) "the destroyer, cutter, splitter, mutilator, bloodthirsty, cruel, fierce, mean, one who does not consider, audacious, deceitful, fraudulent, illusory, crafty, dishonest, addicted to sensual pleasures, of bad character and bad company, of bad conduct, difficult to be advised, of bad vows, of bad joy, devoid of good character and vows, devoid of virtues, without shame, one who does not observe the vows of posadha (fast)."

Padarthanvaya - "Hana - Hanana karo, Chinda-Chedana karo, Bhinda-Bhedana karo" (Saying to the people, the Nastika) Vikattae - One whose limbs are smeared with the blood-water (blood), Chande - Who is fierce, Rudde-Rudra is, Khuddhe - Whose intellect is small, Asamikkhi-yakari - One who acts without consideration, Sahassie - Courageous, Ukkanchana - One who takes bribes, Vachana - Deceitful, Mai - One who practices Maya (illusion), Niyadi - One with hidden deceit, Kutamai - Profound Maya, Sai - Wealth, Oga - Excessive, Duppadi-yanandie - Follower of the wicked, Duvvaya - Of evil vows, Duppadi-yanandie - Delighted in doing and hearing evil deeds, Nissile - Without virtues, Niggune - Devoid of qualities like forgiveness, Nimmere - Beyond limits, Nipacchakkha-na-posahovvase - One who does not renounce and never observes fasting or penance, Asahu - Unrighteous.

Meaning - The Nastika (non-believer) goes around saying to people, "Kill the living beings, cut them, and break them." And he himself becomes the one who cuts (the living beings), his hands are smeared with blood. He is fierce, cruel, and of small intellect, he acts without consideration, he moves about as a courageous person, he takes bribes from people, he is deceitful, he practices Maya (illusion), he creates profound deception, he spreads the net of Maya and uses it excessively, he is of evil conduct, he associates with the wicked, he has evil vows, he is a follower of the wicked, he is without virtues, devoid of qualities, beyond limits, he cannot renounce anything, that is, he never observes fasting or penance, and he is unrighteous.

Commentary - This sutra describes the impact of the life of a Nastika (non-believer). When a person becomes a follower of Nastika principles, first the feeling of compassion disappears from his mind, and he starts considering violence as his goal, going around telling people to kill the living beings in any way possible! He firmly holds these thoughts and behaves the same way with his servants, slaves, and the animal kingdom. His hands are always stained with the slaughter of living beings.

Ṣaṣṭhī Daśā

The person remains immersed in anger. Their nature becomes inherently wrathful. Their every action is merciless. They become narrow-minded. Their courage in committing sinful deeds increases. They do not value this world or the next, and thus they indulge in whatever they desire without any consideration. They take bribes from people. Deceit is considered a great virtue for them, so they practice deception with every individual. Praising the flawed and seeking fame is considered their virtue. They are deceptive, create profound conspiracies, and spread a web of false illusions. They go about slitting the throats of others and remain constantly encouraged to perform the aforementioned actions. They naturally become wicked and associate with the wicked. Their egoism becomes so strong that they do not even accept the good advice of others. Renouncing anger is impossible for them. They indulge in misconduct, adopt wicked vows like meat-eating, and become a follower of violent rituals, immersed in violence. Their nature becomes so corrupt that they cannot be pleased in any way. They do not even acknowledge the favors done by others. Seeing or hearing about misconduct deeply saddens their mind. They are adulterous, shameless, and mock celibacy. Virtues like forgiveness cannot even touch them. They do not hesitate to break any family tradition. For example, if their family prohibits meat-eating, alcohol consumption, and adultery, they would break their ancestors' traditions and indulge in those misdeeds.

They do not observe fasts or austerities on auspicious days like Aṣṭamī. They are unrighteous.

All this is the influence of atheism, that even a naturally pure and sacred soul becomes immersed in sinful deeds. One who does not believe in this world or the next, their involvement in sin is inevitable.

The conclusion is that to purify one's life, the acceptance of theism is necessary, only then can the soul become righteous and eligible for liberation.

Now the author describes other sinful actions that arise from the acceptance of atheism.

## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Sixth Dasha

**Commentary:** This Sutra describes how a non-believing soul cannot renounce the 18 sins. They do not renounce (1) **Praṇātipāta** (all forms of violence against living beings). By "all forms," it means they do not renounce even those acts of violence that are considered reprehensible in worldly conduct. For example, they do not hesitate to commit infanticide, killing women, betrayal, killing sages, killing Brahmins, and killing cows. Similarly, one should understand the meaning of other sins through inference. Here, we will simply give their meaning:

1. **Praṇātipāta** = All forms of violence against living beings.
2. **Mṛṣāvāda** = False testimony, etc.
3. **Adattādāna** = Theft.
4. **Maithuna** = Sexual acts, adultery, etc.
5. **Parigraha** = Attachment.
6. **Krodha** = Anger.
7. **Māna** = Ego.
8. **Māyā** = Deception, trickery.
9. **Lobha** = Greed.
10. **Rāga** = Passion, lust, etc.
11. **Dveṣa** = Hatred.
12. **Kalaha** = Discord, conflict.
13. **Abhyākhyāna** = Slandering others.
14. **Piśunata** = Gossiping.
15. **Para-parivāda** = Speaking ill of others behind their backs.
16. **Rati-arati** = Pleasure at the acquisition of objects and displeasure at their non-acquisition.
17. **Māyā-mṛṣā** = Speaking falsely with deception. For example, deceiving others by changing one's appearance and speaking falsely about hunting animals, etc.
18. **Mithyā-darśana-śalya** = Describing the nature of things falsely, concealing true things, and inventing false things (that do not exist). For example, believing that the soul is not the doer and that God is the doer.

## Sixth Chapter
## With Hindi Commentary

**175**
The conclusion is that the soul cannot be freed from the sins accumulated throughout life by merely embracing the atheistic doctrines. - Now the Sutrakar describes the same subject:

**Sanskrit:**
सव्वाओ कसाय-दंतकट्ठ-हाण-मद्दण-विले वणसद्द-फरिस-रस-रूव-गंध-मल्लाऽलंकाराओ अप्पडिविरया जाव-जीवाए, सव्वाओ सगड-हर-जाण-जुग्गगिल्लिए-थिल्लिएसीया-संदमाणिया-सयणासण-जाण-वाहण-भोयण-पवित्थर-विधीतो अप्पडिविरया जाव-जीवाए ।

**English:**
All kinds of *kṣaya* (passion), *dantakāṣṭha* (tooth-cleaning stick), *snāna* (bathing), *mardana* (massage), *vilepana* (anointing), *śabda* (sound), *sparśa* (touch), *rasa* (taste), *rūpa* (form), *gandha* (smell), *mālā* (garland), and *aṅkāra* (ornaments) - from all these, there is no detachment throughout life. All kinds of *śakata* (cart), *ratha* (chariot), *yāna* (vehicle), *yuga* (yoke), *gilli* (a kind of toy), *thilli* (a kind of toy), *śivikā* (palanquin), *syandanikā* (a kind of palanquin), *śayanāsan* (bed and seat), *yāna* (vehicle), *vāhana* (vehicle), *bhojana* (food), *praviṣṭara* (house), and *vidhīta* (ritualistic) - from all these, there is no detachment throughout life.

**Word by Word:**
* **Savvāo** - all kinds of
* **Kṣaya** - passion
* **Dantakāṣṭha** - tooth-cleaning stick
* **Snāna** - bathing
* **Mardana** - massage
* **Vilepana** - anointing
* **Śabda** - sound
* **Sparśa** - touch
* **Rasa** - taste
* **Rūpa** - form
* **Gandha** - smell
* **Mālā** - garland
* **Aṅkāra** - ornaments
* **Jāva-jīvāe** - throughout life
* **Appḍiviraya** - no detachment
* **Savvāo** - all kinds of
* **Śakata** - cart
* **Ratha** - chariot
* **Yāna** - vehicle
* **Yuga** - yoke
* **Gilli** - a kind of toy
* **Thilli** - a kind of toy
* **Śivikā** - palanquin
* **Syandanikā** - a kind of palanquin
* **Śayanāsan** - bed and seat
* **Yāna** - vehicle
* **Vāhana** - vehicle
* **Bhojana** - food
* **Praviṣṭara** - house
* **Vidhīta** - ritualistic
* **Jāva-jīvāe** - throughout life
* **Appḍiviraya** - no detachment

**Meaning:**
Followers of atheistic doctrines cannot detach themselves throughout life from all kinds of passionate attachments, from things like tooth-cleaning sticks, bathing, massage, anointing, sound, touch, taste, form, smell, garlands, and ornaments. They cannot detach themselves from all kinds of carts, chariots, vehicles, yokes, toys, palanquins, beds, seats, vehicles, food, houses, and ritualistic practices.

Page #244:
---------------------------
## 176
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Sixth Dasha

Even with the practice of abstaining from sleep, sitting, vehicles, food, and household equipment, one cannot achieve complete detachment throughout life.

**Commentary:** In this sutra, the sutrakar states that an atheist cannot achieve complete detachment from the five objects of sense - sound, form, smell, taste, and touch - which generate desires and mental afflictions throughout their life. They cannot achieve detachment from activities like wearing red clothes, brushing teeth, bathing, massage, and applying ointments. Ointments refer to the application of sandalwood and other substances.

The atheist cannot achieve detachment from carts, chariots, palanquins carried by two men, elephant litters, palanquins carried by one man, palanquins carried by two men, palanquins carried by four men, beds, and seats, carts and other vehicles, strong animals used for transportation, food, and household equipment throughout their life.

A small doubt may arise here: In worldly practices, bathing is often seen after a massage. The sutrakar mentions the practice of bathing after a massage. However, sometimes massage is also done after bathing to keep the body lubricated, as in the present time, young men often apply oil to their hair after bathing.

A cart pulled by oxen is called a "shakat". A vehicle carried by two men or an aerial vehicle is called a "yugma". A camel's litter or a palanquin carried by two men is called a "gilli", which is also called a "thilli". However, a cart pulled by two horses or mules can also be called a "thilli". The word "thilli" is also used for a horse's equipment. A "shivika" is a special type of palanquin with a square shape. A "syand-manika" is a vehicle that is as tall as a man. Other special vehicles for water and land should be understood by inference.

The conclusion of the entire statement is that a person who accepts atheism becomes attached to worldly pleasures and then the feelings of detachment never arise in their mind.

The sutrakar again describes the same topic:

Page #247:
---------------------------
## Sixth Chapter
With Hindi Commentary.

Even from the initial actions, they cannot refrain. In addition to these, they cannot refrain from other blameworthy actions, those that produce ignorance and cause suffering to the lives of other beings.

**Commentary:** In this sutra, as in the previous ones, the sutrakar describes the vices of the non-believer, saying that the non-believer acts without experience and reflection, resulting in suffering in this world and the next. He cannot refrain from horses, cows, buffaloes, goats, sheep, slaves, maidservants, laborers, and groups of men throughout his life, meaning that his soul is not inclined towards the path of renunciation. His inclination is always towards enjoyment. He cannot refrain from those who trade in masha or half-masha, rupaka, and karshapan, etc. This means that the non-believer is always immersed in the means of worldly transactions, such as tola, masa, karshapan, mudra, coin, rupee, etc. His mind is always preoccupied with gold, silver, wealth, grain, gems, pearls, conch shells, stone, coral, etc. It is almost impossible for him to refrain from them. He always cheats in weighing and measuring. He sees no fault in it. His mind is always filled with various kinds of resolutions and alternatives. Sometimes he is immersed in the disputes of beginning and starting (agricultural work), sometimes he is distressed. In short, because he cannot refrain from all this, his mind can never be peaceful. He himself commits violence and teaches violence to others. He cooks himself and has others cook for him. In addition to this, deceit, beating, threats, punishment, killing, imprisonment, and various kinds of suffering are always at his heels. It is impossible for him to refrain from them. He cannot refrain from cruel actions that cause pain to other beings, produce ignorance, and lead to the destruction of villages, etc., because all these actions are performed in various ways due to the principles he accepts.

Now the sutrakar describes the subject of other unrighteous actions:

From the world - name - some people - pen - lentil - sesame - mugg - mas - nipphav - kulath - alisandag - jawajava - and so on - in these - unrighteous - cruel

He incurs false punishment. In the same way, in this manner, a man of the human species, cruel in his efforts towards the tittir, vatter, laavak, kapot, kapinjal, miya, mahis, varaha, graha, godha, kumm, sarisvadi, etc., incurs false punishment.
Just as, for example, a certain man is cruel in his efforts towards the kalma, masur, til, mudga, masha, nishpaav, kulath, alisindak, yava, etc., he incurs false punishment. In the same way, in this manner, a man of the human species, cruel in his efforts towards the tittir, vatter, laavak, kapot, kapinjal, mrig, mahis, varaha, graha, godha, kumm, sarisvadi, etc., incurs false punishment.
Word meaning: He - that, Ath - as, Jaha - like, Jaise - as, Name - name, is in the sense of possibility, Ke - some, Purisa - man, Kalma - a particular type of grain, Masur - lentil, Til - sesame, Mung - mung bean, Masha - black gram, Nippaav - a particular type of grain, Kulath - horse gram, Alisindak - a particular type of grain, Java - barley, Evam Aiyehi - etc., many types of grains, Ayate - diligent, Kure - cruel, doing karma, Miccha Dadam - false punishment, Paunjai - uses. Evam Ev - in the same way, Tahppa Gare - in the same way, Purisa Jaaye - human species, Tittir - partridge, Vatter - a type of bird, Miya - deer, Mahis - buffalo, Varaha - boar, Graha - a particular type of creature, Goh - lizard, Kumm - tortoise, Sarisvadi - etc., creatures, Ayatte - diligent, Kure - cruel (merciless), Miccha - false, Dadam - punishment, Paunjai - uses.
_Original meaning: Just as a man is negligent towards kalma, masur, til, masha, nishpaav, kulath, alisindak, and jwar, etc., grains, and uses false punishment cruelly. In the same way, a particular man is negligent towards tittir, vatter, laavak, kapot, kapinjal, mrig, mahis (buffalo), varaha (boar), graha, godha, kachhua, and sadi creatures, and uses false punishment cruelly.

Sixth Stage
With Hindi Bhashya Commentary.
181
Commentary - This sutra expounds that the non-believer souls always behave with ruthlessness towards the mobile beings, just as they do with plants and grains. Just as they mercilessly crush the plants and grains even before they ripen, similarly, they have no compassion in their hearts for all kinds of aquatic, terrestrial and aerial beings. Like plants and grains, they ruthlessly cut and tear apart the completely innocent beings, and do not hesitate at all, because due to being engrossed in the eternal habit of violence, not even a trace of compassion remains in their minds. The feeling of protection also completely vanishes from their minds.

Committing violence daily appears to them as ordinary as the worship of their desired deity to the followers of religion. Just as they cut, crush, grind and cook the grains, similarly, they behave with the mobile five-sensed beings. Imitating them, even their family members also mostly walk on the same path, and the common people also start walking on that path.

'Kalam' is the name of a special grain. 'Masur' is a round-shaped grain. 'Nishpav' is the name of a bean. 'Kulttha' is angular, and in the Saurashtra region, it is called 'Chapattika'. 'Alisindak' refers to a special grain.

Now the sutra-maker again speaks on the same subject:

Just as his external circle (of associates) is, such as slave, messenger, servant, partner, worker, or enjoyment-person, in the same way, he himself metes out severe punishment even for their minor offenses.

Dasha-Shruta-Skandha Sutra
Word-by-word meaning:
Y - and Javi - who from his Bahiria - outer Parisa - Parishad Bhavati is, Tam Jaha like Daseti or Dasi Putra or Pesheti Preshya or Athava Bhiteti - Vaitanik Purusha or Athava Bhailleti - Vyapar etc. in Samaan Bhag wala (Hisse-dar) Kammkareti or Athava Kaam karne wala or Athava Bhogapuriseti - Bhoga - Purusha Tesimp - their Annyargansi - Kisi Aha - Lahuyansi small from Avarahansi - Apradh hone par Sayamev - by themselves Guruya Dand - heavy Dand Vatteti gives, Tam Jaha - like:
Shashti Dasha
Mula-arth - Who is his outer Parishad, like - Das, Preshya, Bhritak, Bhagik, Karmakar and Bhoga-Purusha etc., their any small Apradh happening, by themselves they give them heavy Dand. Like:
I
Teeka - In this Sutra it is described that how the Nastik's behaviour with his outer Parishad (Parijan) is unjust. Bahiya Parishad - Dasi - Putra, Preshya (who is sent here and there for work), Vaitanik Bhritya, Samanaansh - Bhaghi (Hisse-dar), Karma-kar and Bhoga-Purusha etc. (are the names of the people who are related to him), on small Apradh, by themselves give heavy Dand, this is completely unjust. Justice is actually that which gives Dand according to the Apradh, that is, if a big Dand is given for a small Apradh, then it is completely unjust and it is strangling justice.
=
.
But Nastik does not think about justice and injustice, he gives heavy Dand to whoever he wants.

The Sutrakar describes the nature of that Guru-Dand in the next Sutra:
Imam Dandeh, Imam Mundeh, Imam Tajjeh, Imam Taleh, Imam Anduy-bandhanam Kareh, Imam Niyal-bandhanam Kareh, Imam Hadi-bandhanam Kareh, Imam Charag-bandhanam Kareh, Imam Niyal-juyal-sankodiy-modiyam Kareh, Imam Hath - Chhinnyam Kareh, Imam Pay - Chhinnyam Kareh, Imam Utt - Chhinnyam Kareh, Imam Sees - Chhinnyam Kareh, Imam Mukh - Chhinnyam

Here is the English translation, preserving the Jain terms:

This is the Dashashruta-skandha-sutra.

Bind this (person) with ropes, chains and shackles. Cut off his hands. Cut off his feet. Cut off his ears. Cut off his nose. Cut off his lips. Cut off his head. Cut off his face. Cut off his genitals. Tear out his heart.

In this way, tear out his eyes, testicles, teeth, mouth, tongue, and scrotum. Churn him like curd. Impale him on a stake. Shred him with the stake. Sprinkle his wounds with salt. Cut him with sharp kusha grass. Bind him with a lion's tail. Bind him with a bull's tail. Burn him in a forest fire. Feed his flesh to the crows.

Restrict his food and water. Bind him for life. Kill him with some other inauspicious death.

This is the cruel and unethical conduct of the heterodox towards their external assembly.

Cut him off. Bind him with the tail of a lion or a bull. Burn him with fire. Arrange to feed him pieces of his flesh like cowrie shells. Stop his food and water. Keep him in bondage for life. Kill him with some other inauspicious death.

Commentary - This sutra describes the unjust and cruel behavior of a non-believer towards his outer council. If a non-believer is the head of a village, etc. and even a minor offense is committed by his servants, etc., then filled with anger, he prescribes the following severe punishments:

Confiscate all his possessions. Shave off the hair on his head. Humiliate him, beat him with whips, etc., bind him with fetters or chains. Tie him to a wooden post. Imprison him. Constrict and twist his limbs with shackles and bonds. When his limbs are tightly bound, he will regain consciousness. Cut off his hands, feet, nose, ears, head, lips, and mouth. Amputate his genitals. Pierce his heart. Similarly, pluck out his eyes, testicles, teeth, face, and tongue. Thrust a spear through his lower abdomen and pull it out through his mouth. Pierce his abdomen and other parts with a trident. Wound his body with weapons and rub salt on the wounds. Tear him apart with a saw. "Sinha-pucchita" - this means to cut off his penis in the same way as when a lion copulates with a lioness, the penis gets severed upon withdrawal. However, the Ardha-Magadhi dictionary states that peeling off the skin from the back of the neck and hanging him with the shape of a lion's tail, or peeling off the skin in the shape of a bull's tail is a form of education, etc. And binding him like a monkey with a lion's or bull's tail, because a person bound with the tail of a lion or bull becomes an object of great ridicule. By implication, one should understand binding with the tail of an elephant, etc.

## Chapter 186: The Dasha-Shruta-Skandha Sutra, Sixth Dasha

He orders his external council to burn him in the forest fire, to cut his flesh into pieces the size of cowries and feed it to others, to deprive him of food and water, to keep him bound for life, to kill him by some other cruel death, and so on. He prescribes many such horrible and harsh punishments for his external council. He does not know justice.

In the world, every individual should follow the path of justice, not the path of injustice. By following atheistic principles, the soul forgets the path of justice and becomes unjust. Therefore, atheistic principles should be completely rejected.

In this Sutra, in some places, the word 'im' is used in the second case instead of 'shashthi'. This is not a fault, because such a change in case endings often occurs in Prakrit.

Now the Sutrakar describes how the atheist treats his internal council:

"If he has an internal council, such as his mother, father, brother, sister, wife, daughter, or daughter-in-law, and if any of them commits even a minor offense, he himself inflicts a severe punishment on them. For example,..."

**Word-by-word meaning:**

* **Javiya** - And
* **Sa** - He
* **Abhitaria** - Internal
* **Parisa** - Council
* **Bhavathi** - Is
* **Tam Jaha** - Like
* **Mayaathi** - Mother
* **Wa** - Or
* **Piyaathi** - Father
* **Wa** - Or
* **Bhaayaathi** - Brother
* **Wa** - Or
* **Bhaginiithi** - Sister
* **Wa** - Or
* **Bhajjaathi** - Wife
* **Wa** - Or
* **Dhuyaathi** - Daughter
* **Sunhaathi** - Daughter-in-law
* **Tesimp** - To them
* **Y** - Also
* **Annayaransi** - For any
* **Aha-lahuyansi** - Minor offense
* **Avarahasi** - Himself
* **Sayameva** - Only
* **Garuyam** - Severe
* **Dandam** - Punishment
* **Vattethi** - Inflicts

**Note:** The word "ti" at the end of each word is a suffix indicating the end of a word. The word "wa" is a conjunction meaning "or".

He who immerses in cold water, he who sprinkles with hot and vast water, he who burns the body with fire-body, he who skins the sides with a yojtra, a cane, a net, a whip, a small whip, or a vine, he who inflicts pain on the body with a stick, bones, fist, pebbles, or a potsherd, such a man is a दुम्मणा (dummna) when he lives nearby, but a सुमणा (sumna) when he lives far away.

Original Meaning: The non-believer says, "Immerse them in cold water, sprinkle their bodies with hot water, burn them with fire-body, skin their sides with a yojtra, cane, net, whip, small whip, or vine, or inflict pain on their bodies with a stick, elbow, fist, pebbles, or potsherd." Such a man causes suffering to those who live near him, but brings joy to those who are separated from him.

Commentary: This sutra describes how a non-believer, even for minor offenses within the inner council, is ready to inflict the harshest punishments. For example, in winter, he orders the offender to be immersed in extremely cold and vast water, and in summer, he says, "Sprinkle his body with extremely hot water, or burn him with a hot iron ball. Burn him with fire-body. Skin his sides with a yojtra, cane, vine, net, whip, small whip, and tear off his skin with a stick, elbow, fist, pebbles, or potsherd."

Torture his body (Asfoteyati-Atyanta Kuttayati Ityartha) Beat him, kill him.
Now the sutrakar says that whoever stays with such a man, he remains unhappy (Dukhit-Chitt) and when he separates from them, he remains happy. The family members are as happy to be separated from him as the mouse is to be away from the cat.
This statement has clearly proved that there is no prohibition on punishing the offender, but the punishment should be according to justice, looking at the crime, that is, the punishment for a small crime should be small and the punishment for a big crime should be big. The atheist does not see this. He gives the same severe punishment for all crimes, big or small. ... Now the sutrakar describes the same subject:
Tahappagare Puris-Jaae Dandamaasi, Dand-Garue, Dand-Purekkhade Ahie Assi Loyansi Ahie Paransi Loyansi. Te Dukkhenti Soyanti Evam Jhuranti Tippanti Pittei Parit-Ppanati. Te Dukkhan-Soyan-Jhurana-Tippana-Pittana-Parit-Ppana-Vah-Bandha-Parikleasaao Apparidiviraya Bhavanti.

They afflict others, causing them sorrow (soyanti). They also lament (jhuranti), make others weep (tippanti), inflict pain (pittei), and show distress (paritappanti). These wicked-souled ones, by causing suffering to others (dukkhaṇa) and by creating anguish (paritāpaṇa), become bound (baddha) and afflicted (parikileśāo) and remain non-restrained (appāḍiviriyā).

Meaning: Such a person is always ready for punishment. He metes out severe punishment even for minor offenses. He always resorts to punishment. He is harmful in this world and the next world. He, being a non-believer, distresses other living beings, causes them sorrow, makes them lament, makes them weep, inflicts pain on them, and creates distress in them. This person does not desist from causing suffering to others, creating sorrow, lamenting, making them weep, inflicting pain, showing distress, and from the afflictions in the form of bondage and violence.

Commentary: In this sūtra too, the author describes the behavior of the heartless non-believers mentioned earlier, such as the non-believers who are punitive, i.e., do not spare anyone without punishment. Regarding this, the commentator writes: "Such a person is punitive, i.e., he punishes with punishment, does not tolerate the committed offense." That is, he does not release (someone) without punishment for the committed offense. However, in the Ardhamāgadhī dictionary, the reading is "dāṇḍapāsi" (one who gives heavy punishment) or "dāṇḍapāśvin" (one who has a noose of punishment), which means "one who gives severe punishment even for a minor offense." Both these meanings are reasonable. The non-believer considers punishment as supreme and is ready to punish on every occasion. Although such persons are pleased with their own wickedness at that time, their unjust behavior becomes a source of suffering in this world and the next. When he behaves unjustly even with his own relatives, what to say about other living beings. They distress other living beings, cause them sorrow, make their bodies decay, make them weep, inflict pain, and create distress. They never desist from these activities. Their soul is always engaged in harming other living beings.

The term "tippanti" is derived from the root 'tipṛ kṣaraṇe', which means "to cause tears to flow, to produce sorrow".
Now the author describes the same subject:

Just as those who are intoxicated and greedy for sensual pleasures of women, who are immersed in them, who have fallen into them, who have sunk into them, who have spent four, five, six, ten or even fewer or more years enjoying and indulging in sensual pleasures, accumulating many sinful karmas, mostly due to the weight of their accumulated karma, just as they, like a lump of iron or a stone, sinking into water, submerge under the surface of the earth, in the same way, that kind of man, full of faults, full of impurities, full of mud, full of enmity, full of hypocrisy and deceit, full of false hopes, of ill-repute, of lack of faith, mostly a killer of living beings, after passing away in the due course of time, becomes established in the nether regions of hell.

Page #260:
---------------------------
Here is the English translation, preserving the Jain terms:

Just as those persons are infatuated with, greedy for, extremely greedy for, and extremely attached to the enjoyment of sensual pleasures (kama-bhoga) for four, five, six, or ten years, or for a somewhat shorter or longer period, and having enjoyed the sensual pleasures and frequented the places of enmity (vairayatana), they accumulate abundant karmic merit (pava-kammani) and, being impelled mostly by the burden of that weighty karma, just as a lump of iron or a stone ball, when thrown into water, sinks down and settles on the bottom of the earth, in the same way that person, being heavily laden with adamantine (vajja) karmas, bound by the karmas of previous births, abounding in many sinful karmas, with an excess of enmity (vera), with an excess of lack of faith (appatti), with an abundance of the mud (panka) of sinful karmas, with an excess of hypocrisy and deceit (dambha-chala), with an excess of ill-repute (asati), with an excess of lack of faith (appatti), and being mostly the killer of living beings (pana-ghati), when his time comes, having crossed over the surface of the earth, settles down in the nether world (naraga).

## Sixth Chapter

**With Hindi Commentary**

Due to an abundance of desire and disgrace, by killing living beings, by the influence of time, the soul, being overcome by time, crosses the earth and descends to the hellish realms.

**Commentary:** This sutra describes the karma and its fruits of a non-believer. For example, such a non-believer is engrossed in sensual pleasures, has a strong desire for them, is bound by the threads of attachment to them, and remains constantly attached to them. Similarly, just as a ball of iron or stone thrown into water crosses the water and settles on the ground, so too, burdened by heavy karma, enveloped by past karma, due to the rise of sinful karma, an abundance of hatred, an excess of non-understanding, an abundance of deceit and betrayal, an excess of peace (meaning lack of virtue), an increase in disgrace, and the killing of living beings, when the time comes, the soul, being overcome by time, crosses the earth and directly reaches the hells like Ratnaprabha, etc. In other words, to experience the fruits of their evil karma, they are born in hell.

The essence of the above statement is that just as a ball of iron or stone, due to its weight, directly reaches the ground, similarly, a non-believer, due to the burden of evil karma, finds refuge only in hell. Because after death, every being goes to heaven or hell according to their karma. They have to experience the fruits of their karma.

This sutra reveals the fruits of sinful karma. The word "Kalmas" should also be understood to mean day, night, and auspicious moments. It is also important to note that the committed sin itself begins to induce the doer to perform the same action again, according to the fruits of the action.

Now the author describes hell:

They are like a well, round inside and square outside, with a rough and uneven surface, always enveloped in darkness and gloom.

The earth is like a pigeon or a black fire, with a rough, harsh, and difficult-to-bear touch. It is inauspicious, and the hell itself is inauspicious. The suffering in hell is also inauspicious. The word "no" is used for emphasis. In the figure of speech called "vakyalankara," the inhabitants of hell, the "naraki," do not sleep, or they sleep a sleep called "payala," or they experience memory, desire, fortitude, or intellect. They experience bright, vast, deep, harsh, bitter, fierce, cruel, painful, sharp, intense, and unbearable suffering in hell. They wander around experiencing the pain of hell. The word "no" is used in the figure of speech called "vakyalankara."

**Original Meaning:**

The hells are round on the inside and square on the outside. They are situated on a foundation like a razor. There is always darkness and gloom there. The light of the sun, moon, and stars is far away from them. The ground of these hells is covered with mud made of fat, grease, flesh, blood, and corrupted blood. They are impure and ugly. There is a strong stench there, and they have the glow of black fire. The harsh touch is difficult to bear. The hells are inauspicious. Their suffering is also inauspicious. The inhabitants of hell do not experience sleep or the sleep called "prachala," nor do they experience memory, desire, fortitude, or intellect. They wander around in hell experiencing bright, vast, deep, harsh, bitter, fierce, cruel, painful, sharp, intense, and unbearable suffering.

**Commentary:**

This sutra describes the hells and their suffering. For example, the inside of hell is round and the outside is square. The ground of the hells is like a razor.

## 166
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Sixth Dasha

The same intensity is there. Due to the absence of the Jyotishchakra, there is continuous darkness. The Parmadharmi Devas, to give pain to the Narakis, create many undesirable substances through Vaikriya (Vikurvana), such as: Med (Charvi), Vasa, Mans, Rudhir, and Put, etc. They use these Vikurvanas to coat the surface of the earth. The intense smell of these foul substances pervades all of Naraka. All substances there are hot, like the glow of Krishnagni. The Naraki Jivas constantly experience unbearable pain. Their Nidra, Prachala (sitting and sleeping), Smriti, Rati, Buddhi, Dhriti, etc., are all destroyed. Due to this, they constantly experience bright, pure, abundant, deep, harsh, bitter, fierce, angry, rough, inaccessible, extremely painful, and intense pain while wandering. The implication is that there is no happiness in Naraka, even for a moment. One has to constantly experience intense pain there. All this pain is the result of the bad Karmas performed in the previous birth, when the soul was a follower of the Nastik Mat.

Now, the Sutrakar strengthens the above subject with an example:

Just as a tree named "Nama" grows on a mountain, with its roots cut off, and it falls down because it is low, difficult, and uneven, similarly, a man born in this world, from womb to womb, from birth to birth, from death to death, from pain to pain, will become a Dakshina-Gami-Nairyika, Krishna-Pakshiya, and will come to a time when it is difficult to find a Bodhi. And he will also become an Akriya-Vadi.

Original meaning: - Just as a tree born on the top of a mountain, when its root is cut, due to the heaviness of its front part, falls where there is a low, uneven and inaccessible place, in the same way, an atheist man also (falls) from womb to womb, from death to death, from birth to birth and from sorrow to sorrow. The south-going hellish, the dark-fortnightly and the future rare-enlightened one. This is also called the inaction-way (this is the fruit of inaction-way).
Commentary: - In this sutra, the fruit of inaction-way and its conclusion have been done. For example, a tree born on the top of a mountain - whose front part is thick and root is thin - when its root is cut or broken, it falls only towards the lower place, in the same way, the atheist who does cruel deeds, due to the burden of his evil deeds, goes only towards hell. After this, he undergoes many transformations like the actor of the stage. He has to wander in all the four paths and various births for an infinite time. He does not get rid of the cycle of the world, therefore, the sutra-maker has called him 'dark-fortnightly'.
Dark-fortnightly is actually called the one who wanders in the cycle of the world more than half-pudgal-paravart and the one whose cycle of the world is less than half-pudgal-paravart is called the bright-fortnightly.

Page #266:
---------------------------
## 168
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

Not only does a non-believer have to wander in the cycle of existence, but they also have to become a south-bound hell-being to experience various kinds of suffering. The hells in the south direction are extremely painful compared to the hells in the north direction. There, the hell-being experiences suffering and also earns the karma of rare enlightenment. This means that even if they get a human birth due to the rise of some auspicious karma, attaining Dharma becomes extremely rare for them. Therefore, they become rare-enlightened in the future. Their past bad karma prevents them from going towards the path of liberation, and as a result, they remain turned away from it. This is called inaction-doctrine.

The intention of the Sutrakar in explaining this non-believer or inaction-doctrine is simply to remind the devotee that the aforementioned state is the fate of those who believe in non-belief. Therefore, a person who desires their own well-being should completely abandon this non-belief doctrine. Because it contains nothing but injustice, and its consequences are terrible in both worlds.

## Sixth Dasha

Now the Sutrakar speaks about the subject of belief:

"Who is the one who believes in action-doctrine? The one who believes in action, believes in the world, believes in the view, believes in right action, believes in restraint, believes in the existence of the other world, believes in the existence of this world, believes in the existence of Maya, believes in the existence of the soul, believes in the existence of Arhanta, believes in the existence of Chakravarti, believes in the existence of Baldeva, believes in the existence of Vasudeva, believes in the existence of the fruits of good and bad karma, believes that good karma leads to good results, believes that bad karma leads to bad results, believes in the attainment of liberation through good deeds, believes in the transmigration of souls, believes in the existence of Nirjara, believes in the existence of Devas, believes in the existence of Siddhi, such a person is the one who believes in action, believes in the world, believes in the view, and is deeply attached to desire, passion, and delusion."

When the mind is firmly established in pure passion, it becomes **nivitta** (firmly established). Such a person is **mahicche** (possessing high desires) and becomes **jav** (swift) and **uttar-gamie** (a follower of the northern hells). This means that if they are destined for hell due to their actions, they will go to the hells in the north. They are **sukk pakkhiye** (belonging to the bright fortnight) and **agaṇam** (coming) in the future, they become **sulbh-bohie** (easily attaining the knowledge of the path to liberation). **Yavi** (both 'ch' and 'api' words should be understood in the sense of mutual expectation or conjunction) **tan** (this) **kiriya-vadi** (action-oriented) is the one who is **kiriya-vadi** (action-oriented).

They support all these things. This is their knowledge, this is their vision. Their mind is firmly established in pure passion. They are full of intense desires. They are **uttar-gamie** (a follower of the northern hells). They are called **sukk-pakkhiye** (belonging to the bright fortnight) and in the future, they become **sulbh-bohi** (easily attaining the knowledge of the path to liberation). This is called **kiriya-vadi**.

## Teeka - 

This sutra describes the subject of **kiriya-vad**. **Kiriya-vad** is the same as **astik-vad**. One who believes in it is called a **kiriya-vadi** or **astik-vadi**. An **astik-vadi** is one who believes that beings and other substances go to the afterlife after death, like "**asti paraloka-yayi jivadi padartha iti vaditum shilam asyeshti - astik-vadi**" (It is the nature of this one to say that beings and other substances go to the afterlife - this is an **astik-vadi**). They are also **astik-prajna** (possessing the knowledge of a believer), like "**asti prajna-vicharan buddhi-vikalpo yasya sa astik-prajna**" (One who has the knowledge of a believer, the thought, the intellect, the discrimination, is an **astik-prajna**).

**Prajna** is the movement of intellect. Similarly, it is also the **Astika** view. When an **Astika** soul becomes a **Samyagvadi**, they strive towards the path of **Moksha**, and therefore become a **Mokshavadi**. They consider the nature of substances as **Dravya**, **Guna**, and **Paryaya**. They believe in **Naraka**, **Tiryak**, **Manushya**, and **Deva-loka**. They believe that there are other worlds and other paths besides the human world and human path. They accept things as they are, meaning they accept **Mata**, **Pita**, **Arhant**, **Chakravarti**, etc. in their appropriate forms. They believe that the fruits of good deeds are good, and the fruits of bad deeds are bad, because the existence of the soul is connected to the deeds it has done. These deeds are in the form of **Pap** or **Punya**. The soul, under the influence of these deeds, experiences happiness or sorrow in the afterlife according to its actions. When the soul is freed from the conflict of **Karma**, it attains **Moksha** and achieves the state of **Nirvana**. The person who accepts the existence of the soul can easily accept **Swarga**, **Naraka**, **Tiryak**, **Punya**, **Pap**, **Samvara**, and **Nirjara**, etc.

201

The existence of the soul and the refutation of the **Nastika** view are discussed in detail in Jain **Nyaya** texts. Inquisitive individuals should definitely study these texts. They refute the **Nastika** view with mature arguments. Therefore, the **Astika** accepts the existence of things that have real existence, and considers things that have no existence as **Nastitva-bhava**. This is why they are called **Samyagvadi**. In **Samyagvad**, the eternal and non-eternal nature of substances, **Dravya** and **Paryaya**, are understood through **Samyag** principles. For example, the soul is eternal in relation to **Dravya**, and non-eternal in relation to **Paryaya**. Similarly, one should understand other substances as well.

If a **Kriyavadi** accepts **Samyagvad** and understands substances through **Samyag** principles, but does not enter the path of **Samyag** character and instead engages in cruel actions like the **Nastikas** and adopts their conduct, then after death, they will also have to go to **Naraka**. However, they will be born among the **Naraki** in the north direction, and they are called **Shuklapakshika Naraki**. In the future, they will earn **Sulabhabodhi** deeds...

##  Chapter 202, Tenth Chapter of Dasha Shruta Skandha, Sixth Dasha

It is easy for a soul to attain Samyakvad in its future births, because all souls who are active can become Shukhala Paakshik and attain Moksha. This is the result of accepting Kriyavad, that the soul becomes Shukhala Paakshik and easily attains knowledge.

It is proven that the soul can attain its own welfare through Samyakvad. Even if the soul accepts Astikvad but does not adopt Samyak Charitra, it cannot escape the cycle of births and deaths. Therefore, only through Samyak Gyan, Samyak Darshan, and Samyak Charitra can one attain Nirvana, not otherwise.

In this Sutra, "Athsi (Asti)" is used in place of "Santi (Santi)" Kriya-pad, and in the word "Agamesshanam", "Lut: Sadva" from the Sutra is used with the Lrut suffix in the future tense.

Now the Sutrakar describes the subject of the first image of the Upasak:

**Sava-dhamma-rui yavi bhavathi. Tass nan bahui sil-vay-gun-veraman-pacchakkhan-posho-vvasai no samm pattavi-puvvai bhavanthi. Evam dassan-padhama uvasag-padima. ||1||**

**Sarva-dharma-ruchi chaapi bhavathi. Tasy nu bahuvah shil-vrat-gun-viraman-pratyakhyan-poshadho-pavasah no samyak prasthapit-purvai bhavanthi. Evam darshan-prathama-upasak-pratima. ||1||**

**Word by word meaning:**

* Sava-dhamma-rui yavi - Interest in all Dharma exists
* Tass - For him
* Bahui - Many
* Sil-vay - Anuvrat
* Gun - Gunvrat
* Veraman - Samayik Vrat in the form of abstinence
* Pacchakkhan - Deshavakashik Vrat in the form of rejection
* Posho-vvasai - Poshadho-upavas Vrat
* Samm - Correctly
* No - Not
* Pattavi-puvvai - Established in the soul before
* Bhavanthi - They are
* Evam - Thus
* Padhama - First
* Uvasag - Upasak's
* Dassan - Darshan
* Padima - Image
* Nan - For Vakyalankar

This is the first image of the Upasak, who has interest in all Dharma, but has not yet established the correct practices of Anuvrat, Gunvrat, Samayik Vrat, Deshavakashik Vrat, and Poshadho-upavas Vrat in their soul.

## Sixth Stage

**With Hindi Commentary**

**203**

**Original Meaning:** The first stage of the vow (darshan-pratima) has an interest in all religions. But many of its vows, virtues, restraints, rejections, and fasts are not properly established in the soul. This is how the devotee's first stage of the vow is.

**Commentary:** This sutra describes the subject of the devotee's darshan-pratima. After renouncing worldly actions and surrendering all possessions to their children or heirs, the devotee should enter the fasting hall. There, they should dedicate their new life to religious practices. To cultivate the darshan-pratima (vow), the devotee should adopt a neutral perspective and consider the principles of each philosophy. This means that to enter the path of Dharma, the devotee must first embrace "Samyavada" (the doctrine of equality). Before embracing Samyavada, it is appropriate to consider each philosophy. In this cycle of existence, there are many philosophies, but the two main ones are Nastika-vada (non-belief) and Astika-vada (belief). Other philosophies, such as Charvaka-vada, Panchbhautik Tatcharir and Tajjivavada, Ishwaravada, Prakritivada, Niyativada, Karmavada, Purusharthavada, Kalavada, Svabhaavavada, Yogavada, Kartrivada, Akartrivada, Nityavada, Anityavada, Atmavda, Satvavada, Asatyavada, Kshanikavada, Akshanikavada, Falavada, Afalavada, etc., all fall under these two main philosophies. The devotee should carefully consider these philosophies with a very subtle intellect and then, relying on Samyavada, cultivate right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct. However, in the devotee's first stage of the vow, only right faith and right knowledge are considered. For example:

"Padham Uvasag-Padim Padivanne Samanovasae Savva-Dhamm-Rui Yavi Bavati." (The devotee who has accepted the first stage of the vow, the Shramanopasaka, becomes interested in all religions.)

The real meaning of this sutra is that when the Shramanopasaka accepts the first stage of the vow, they can understand the nature of all things. Because until someone has a good understanding of the soul and living beings, how can they follow the actions related to conduct? Therefore...

Page #272:
---------------------------
##  204
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

One must definitely understand the nature of the substances through Nayas and proofs. If doubts arise due to the deceit of the heart, one should believe in the truthfulness of the words of the Lord and stabilize the mind with unwavering faith. The Shravak should know all of them. He should be interested in Shruta and Charitra Dharma. But remember, just as Shruta-Dharma and Artha-Dharma are two distinct Dharmas, similarly Charitra-Dharma is also presented as two distinct Dharmas: Desha-Charitra-Dharma and Sarva-Charitra-Dharma. He should also be interested in Ksanti (patience) and other Shraman-Dharmas, because the Sutra says that there are ten types of Dharmas, such as Gram-Dharma, Nagar-Dharma, Rashtra-Dharma, etc. - one should be interested in knowing all of them. When he knows all the Dharmas well, then he can be interested in religious activities. Therefore, the Sutrakar has said, "Ahi (Astik)-vadi" - "Jivaadipadartha: Sartho'stiti Matirasyeti Astikah" - meaning, one who believes in the existence of Jivaadi substances is called Astik. An Astik can understand and explain the 'Astik-Bhav' to everyone. Therefore, he also has the right to preach. His soul is colored in Dharma-Rag, and he does not even want the help of Devaadik, because he is endowed with the five characteristics of Samyag-vad: Upsham, Sanveg, Nirved, Anukampa, and Astikta. Therefore, the first Pratimā is called Darshan-Pratimā because of the presence of Astikya-Bhav. A person who accepts the existence of the soul can easily accept the existence of Mokshaadi substances. The first Sutra says that an Astik-vadi is an Astik-Prajna: "Astikye-Saphalpadarthaastitve Prajna-Vicharana Sadartha-Paryalocanarupa Yass Sa Astikya-Prajna:" meaning, one whose intellect is capable of considering all substances with meaning is called Astikya-Prajna.

## Sixth Dasha

In the first, i.e., Darshan-Pratimā, the soul is situated in Astik-Bhav, but it does not enter the other Vratas - Sheel-Brahmacharya, etc., and the five Anuvratas. This means that he does not accept the Sheel-Vrata, the five Anuvratas, the seven Shiksha or Guna-Vratas - which are the protectors of Sheel-Vratas - the Viraman-rupa Samayik Vrata, the Pratyakhyan-rupa Deshavakashik Vrata, and the Vratas like Paushdhopavas Vrata on festival days. The Churnikar explains the above-mentioned Vratas as follows: "Sheelani Samayik-Deshavakashik...

Page #273:

## Sixth Stage

**With Hindi Commentary**

**Vows like Pauṣadha-tithi and Saṁvibhāga** - These are the five Āṇuvratas, the three Guṇavratas, and the Pauṣadhopavāsas. The word Pauṣadha means "that which nourishes and sustains." The Pauṣadhopavāsas are to be observed on the eighth, fourteenth, full moon, new moon, and other festival days. This means observing a fast on festival days. There are four types of Pauṣadhopavāsas: Āhāra-Pauṣadha, Śarīra-Pauṣadha, Satkāra-Pauṣadha, and Brahmacarya-Pauṣadha.

**205**

The meaning is that in the first stage, the soul does not adopt any other rules besides Samyak-darśana, nor does it enter into the aforementioned qualities. It does not observe the twelve vows of a Śrāvaka perfectly, but observes them imperfectly, meaning it observes Samyak-darśana according to the rules. This stage is called Avṛtti-Samyak-dṛṣṭi. Because it is adorned with Samyak-darśana, it is called Śukla-pākṣika. The duration of this stage is one month. This is how the first stage of Darśana-pratima is described.

Now, the Sūtrakāra describes the second stage:

**Ahavara doccha uvāsaga-paḍimā, savvadhamm-ruī yāvi bhavati. Tassa ṇam bahūīṁ sīlavay-guṇa-veramaṇ-paccakkāna-posahovavāsaiṁ sammṁ paṭṭaviaiṁ bhavanti se ṇam sāmaiyaṁ desāvagāsiyam no sammṁ aṇupālitta bhavanti. Docca uvāsaga-paḍimā ||2||**

**I**

**Athāparā dvitīyopaāsaka-pratima, sarva-dharma-ruciścāpi bhavati. Tasyanu bahuvaḥ śīlavrata-guṇaviramaṇa-pratyākhyāna-pauṣadhopavāsāḥ samyak prasthāpitā bhavanti. Sa nu sāmayikaṁ deśāvakāśikaṁ no samyaganupālayitā bhavati. Dvitīyopaāsaka-pratima ||2||**

**Word-by-word meaning:**

**Ahavara** - after this, **docca** - second, **uvāsaga-paḍimā** - Upāsaka-pratima, **savva-dhamm-ruī yāvi** - has interest in all Dharma, **tassa** - he, **bahūī** - many, **sīlavay** - Śīla-vratas, **guṇa** - Guṇa-vratas, **veramaṇ** - Viramaṇa-vratas, **paccakkāna** - Pratyākhyāna-vratas, and **posahovavāsaiṁ** - Pauṣadhopavāsas, **sammṁ** - perfectly, **paṭṭaviaiṁ bhavanti** - are established in the soul, **se ṇam sāmaiyaṁ desāvagāsiyam no sammṁ aṇupālitta bhavanti** - but he does not perfectly observe Sāmayika and Deśāvakāśika. **Docca uvāsaga-paḍimā** - Second Upāsaka-pratima ||2||

Page #274:
---------------------------
##  Chapter 206, Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra, Sixth Dasha

**It establishes that:**  A person who does not properly observe the Samayik and Desavakasik vows is not a true follower. This is the second type of Upasak-Pratima.

**Original Meaning:** The second type of Upasak-Pratima has an interest in all aspects of Dharma. They observe many types of Sila-Vrat, Guna-Vrat, Viraman-Vrat, Pratyakhyan, and Poushadhopavas. However, they do not properly observe the Samayik and Desavakasik vows. This is the second type of Upasak-Pratima.

**Commentary:** This Sutra describes the second type of Upasak-Pratima. When a person's soul is filled with Samyak-Darshan, they turn towards purity of character and strive to eliminate karma. Since Charitra-Varaniya cannot be completely destroyed, they cannot fully embrace all aspects of Dharma. However, they do decide to observe Desha-Vrat for the benefit of their soul. They voluntarily observe the five Sila-Vrat: Ahimsa (refraining from harming living beings), Mrisha-Vad (refraining from false speech), Adattadan (refraining from stealing), Swadara-Santosha (contentment with one's own possessions), and Parigraha-Viraman (refraining from excessive possessions). Along with these, they also observe the three Guna-Vrat: Dig, Bhog, Paribhog, and Anarthadanda-Viraman. These three are beneficial for the aforementioned Sila-Vrat. They then begin to properly observe the four Vrat: Samayik, Desavakasik, Poushadh, and Atithi-Sanvibhag. Observing these educational Vrat brings an extraordinary state of Samadhi to the soul. At that time, the soul of the Shravak is filled with "Bahvah Silavat-Gunavrat-Viraman Poushadhopavasah Samyak Prasthapitaah-Swatmani Niveshitah Bhavanti." The 12 Vrat of the Shravak are properly established within the soul.

In this type of Pratima, although the soul becomes capable of properly observing the 12 Vrat of the Shravak, they are unable to properly observe the Samayik and Desavakasik (extent of directions) Vrat physically and at the appropriate time. This type of Pratima is allotted two months: one month for the first type of Pratima and one month for this type.

Now the Sutrakar speaks about the third Upasaka-Pratimā:

## Chapter 208: The Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

**The third type of devotee** has established the vows of **viraman**, **pratyakhyan**, and **paushdhopavas** within their soul. They properly observe the **samayik** and **deshavakashik** vows. However, they are unable to properly observe the **paushdhopavas** vow on festival days like **Chaturdashi**, **Ashtami**, **Amavasya**, and **Pournima**.

**Commentary:** This sutra describes the third type of devotee. This devotee diligently follows the previously mentioned qualities and properly observes the **samayik** and **deshavakashik** vows, meaning they are performed at the right time.

**Question:** What are **samayik** and **deshavakashik**?

**Answer:** **Samayik** is the vow that brings peace to attachment and aversion, and benefits the soul with knowledge, vision, and conduct. **Samayik** is abandoned through the two causes and three yogas of **savady yoga**. The sacred time of **samayik** should be spent in **swadhyay** (self-study) and **dharma-dhyan** (meditation on dharma). **Deshavakashik** is a vow where there is a slight deviation from the prescribed time for the six **digvrat** (vows related to directions) based on the direction's influence.

The third type of devotee, although they observe **samayik** and **deshavakashik** vows, cannot properly observe the **paushdhopavas** vow on festival days.

**Question:** What is **paushdhopavas**?

**Answer:** **Paushdhopavas** is the vow that significantly increases **dharma-dhyan** through specific rules and actions. There are four types of **paushdhopavas**:

1. **Ahar-paushdhopavas:** Spending time in **dharma-dhyan** and restraint by abstaining from food in a specific region or completely.
2. **Sharira-paushdhopavas:** Abandoning attachment to the body and not caring for it.
3. **Vyapaar-paushdhopavas:** Abandoning business.

4. Spending time through **Brahmacharya**, **Poushadha** and **Kusal Anusthan**, because in the statement "**Brahma Veda Brahma Tapo Brahma Gyanam Cha Shashvatam**", it is proven that **Kusal Anusthan** is achieved through **Brahmacharya**. However, in this context, one should know the authority of that **Poushadha Vrat** which is performed in the **Poushadha Shala** by entering alone and observing **Poushadha** according to the 11th **Vrat** with **Upavasak Vrat** for eight **Prahar**. In this, all eight **Prahar** are spent in **Dharma**, **Dhyan** and **Samadhi**.

The **Upasak** with the third **Pratima** does not perform the **Poushadha Vrat** properly on **Parva** days, but performs the **Samayik Vrat** properly at both times. Here, it is important to note that **Samayik** is prescribed only for morning and evening, not for **Trisandhya**, meaning it is not necessary to perform it at midday. Three months are fixed for this third **Pratima**.

Now, the **Sutrakara** describes the subject of the fourth **Pratijna**:

**Ahavara Chauthi Uvasag-Padima. Savva-Dhamm-Rui Yavi Bhavati. Tass Nan Bahui Siilavay-Gun-Veraman-Pacchakkhan-Posaho-Vasaai Samman Pattviyaai Bhavanti. Se Nan Samaaiyam De Savagasaiyam Samm Anupalitta Bhavati. Se Nan Chauddasi-Atthami-Udithth-Punnamaasiniisu Padipunnam Posah Samm Anupalitta Bhavati. Se Nan Eg-Raiyam Uvasag-Padim No Samm Anupalitta Bhavati. Chauthi Uvasag-Padima. ||4||**

**Atha Apra Chaturyupasak-Pratima. Sarva-Dharma-Ruchi Sch'api Bhavati. Tasya Nu Bahuvah Shila-Vrat-Gun-Viraman-Pratyakhyan-Poushadho-Pavasaah Samyak Prasthapitah Bhavanti.

This is the 210th Sutra of the Dasha Shruta Skandha. 

**Sixth Dasha**

**Padyarthanvaya:** This is the explanation of the fourth Upasaka-Pratima. 

**Explanation:** 

The one who has this Pratima has an interest in all Dharmas. He has established many Sheel, Gun, Veraman, Pratyakhyan and Poushadhopavas Vratas in his soul. He properly observes Samayik and Desavagasi Vratas. He properly observes the full Poushadh Vratas on the days of Chaturdashi, Ashtami, Amavasya and Purnimaasi. But he does not properly observe the Upasaka-Pratima of one night. This is the fourth Upasaka-Pratima.

**Original Meaning:** Now we are talking about the fourth Upasaka-Pratima. The one who has this Pratima has an interest in all Dharmas. He has established many Sheel, Gun, Veraman, Pratyakhyan and Poushadhopavas Vratas in his soul. He properly observes Samayik and Desavagasi Vratas. He fully observes the full Poushadh Vratas on the days of Chaturdashi, Ashtami, Amavasya and Purnimaasi. But he does not properly observe the Upasaka-Pratima of one night. This is the fourth Upasaka-Pratima.

**Commentary:** This Sutra explains the fourth Pratima. The one who has this Pratima follows all the rules of the first, second and third Pratiamas. He also starts observing the full Poushadh Vratas on festival days. But he cannot properly observe the vow of meditating in the state of Kayotsarga for one night as an Upasaka.

Page #279:
---------------------------
## Sixth Stage

This is the sixth stage, with commentary in Hindi.

Now the question arises, what does the Sutrakar mean by "perfect medicine"? The answer is that the Sutrakar means the proper observance of the medicine fast by abandoning the aforementioned food, bodily care, non-celibacy, and business. "It nourishes and strengthens good conduct and auspicious news, such as refraining from violence, etc. Therefore, the abandonment of food, etc., and the practice of bodily care, celibacy, and business avoidance are called medicine in this context. It is said that it nourishes and strengthens the Dharma. Therefore, fasting is a state of being, and one who observes it becomes a follower and practitioner, not just a mere acceptor and abandoner." In other words, anything that strengthens Dharma and good conduct is called medicine. There are four aspects to it: (1) Food medicine - abandoning all or some food, (2) Bodily care medicine - abandoning all or some bodily care, (3) Non-celibacy medicine - abandoning all or some forms of non-celibacy, and (4) Business medicine - abandoning all or some business. These are described in detail in other texts. Curious individuals should learn about them from there. The commentary on the eleventh chapter of the Samavayanga Sutra says, "It nourishes and strengthens good conduct - the practice of abandoning food, etc., is medicine. It is not just a state of being - it is a fast lasting a day and night. Or, medicine is a fast on the eighth day of the fortnight, etc., and it is a fast without food. This is the etymology. The word "practice" refers to changes in food, bodily care, celibacy, and business. Therefore, one who is engaged in the medicine fast is called a medicine fast practitioner, etc." In other words, anything that strengthens good conduct is called a medicine fast. This fourth stage is four months long, with the aforementioned qualities and the time of the previous stages. It is particularly successful in medicine and Samayik fasts.

Now the Sutrakar speaks of the fifth stage:

The fifth stage is the Uvasaga-Padima. It is as if all Dharma is flourishing. It has many virtues... until it becomes perfectly observed. It is Samayik... similarly, it is the fourteenth day... similarly, it is... It is the Uvasaga-Padima observed perfectly for one year. It is...

21. Dashashruta-skandha-sutra
I
As an ashinaniya (one who does not bathe), viyadbhoji (one who does not eat at night), maulikadhara (one who does not let the dhoti hang down), diva-bramhachari (one who observes celibacy during the day), and ratti-parimanakara (one who observes the vow of limiting sexual activity), he wanders about in this manner, dwelling for the minimum of one day, two days, or three days, and at the most for five months. This is the fifth upasaka-pratima (fifth stage of the householder's vow).

Sixth Stage
Thereafter comes the fifth upasaka-pratima. He also develops interest in all dharmas. He strictly observes various vows and practices them properly. He also observes the samayika (equanimity) vow, and similarly, the chaturdashi (fourteenth day of the lunar fortnight) and the ekaratrika (one-night) upasaka-pratima (vow) properly. He is an asnataka (one who does not bathe), vikatabhoyi (one who does not eat sumptuous food), mukulikrita (one who ties up the hair), diva-bramhachari (one who observes celibacy during the day), and ratti-parimanakara (one who observes the vow of limiting sexual activity). He wanders about in this manner, dwelling for the minimum of one day, two days, or three days, and at the most for five months. This is the fifth upasaka-pratima.

Page #281:
---------------------------
Sixth Stage
With Hindi Bhasha Tika.
Meaning - Now they speak of the fifth pratima (stage of spiritual development). The one who has attained this pratima has interest in all religions. He has adopted the vows of shila, etc. He properly performs the samaayika and deshavakashika vows. He observes the poshadha vow on the fourteenth, eighth, new moon and full moon days. He also properly observes the one-night kāyotsarga pratima. He does not bathe, renounces night meals, does not remove the long part of the dhoti, remains celibate during the day, and limits sexual activity at night. In this way, he wanders for at least one day, two days, or three days, up to a maximum of five months. This is the fifth upasaka-pratima.

213
Commentary - This sutra describes the fifth pratima. The one who observes the fifth pratima properly follows the rules of the previously mentioned four pratimas. For example, first, he has interest in all religions. He adopts the vows of shila, etc. and follows them without fail. He properly performs the samaayika and deshavakashika vows. He worships the poshadha vow on the fourteenth, eighth, new moon and full moon days. Along with these, he also properly observes the one-night kāyotsarga pratima. In this fifth pratima, five things are particularly observed: not bathing for five months, renouncing night meals, not removing the long part of the dhoti, observing celibacy during the day, and limiting sexual activity at night. The fifth pratima is properly observed according to these rules. If someone who has adopted the fifth pratima concludes his worldly life (dies) or attains diksha within one, two, three or ten days, i.e., before the five-month period, then the duration will be only for those many days for him. But for those who are alive and have not attained diksha, the duration of the fifth pratima is set at five months. The duration of the earlier pratimas is also included within this.

Dashaśrutaskandhasūtra
Sixth Dasha
The word "asnana" in the sūtra refers to not performing a complete ablution (sarva-snāna), but washing the limbs like the hands is not prohibited. And "viyaḍabhoi (vikaṭabhojī)" means "one who does not eat at night or in the dark, as stated in the scripture. He eats in the day or in a lighted place. Earlier, there was no restriction on night-eating, hence this is stated." That is, he eats in the day and in a lighted place, but does not eat at night or in a dark place. The sūtra also states that he should limit his sexual activities at night. The commentator writes about this - "The term 'at night' (ratti) indicates the time period of night. What is the limit of his indulgence in women or their pleasures? He says: 'In the periods of vows, fasts, and other auspicious occasions when the body is restrained, and on days' - that is, he should observe complete celibacy on the days of vows and the nights of the ascetic vows, but on other days, he may indulge within the prescribed limit. This vow should be observed according to the sūtra, according to the scriptural injunctions (yathākalpam), according to the path of knowledge (yathāmārgam), according to the true nature (yathātathyam), with equanimity (yathāsamyag), touching with the body (kāyena spṛśati), purifying from transgressions (śobhayati śodhayati vā), fulfilling the vows (tīrayati), praising on the day of the fast-breaking (kīrtayati), and observing continuously (anupālayati). And he should worship the command of the venerable Lord (ājñāmārādhayati) during the observance of the vow as well as at other times.

He observes the Upasaka-Pratima for one night. He does not bathe, does not eat at night, does not wear a dhoti, observes Brahmacharya vows day and night, but he does not abandon mindful eating.  He practices this way for at least one day, two days, three days, and at most six months. This is the sixth Upasaka-Pratima.

## Commentary

This Sutra describes the subject of the sixth Pratima. The person who enters this Pratima follows all the rules from the interest in all religions to the fifth Pratima. He particularly worships the Upasaka Pratima for one night and does not bathe, does not eat at night, does not wear a dhoti, and remains celibate day and night. He strictly follows these rules. Along with these, he also abandons the stories that cause lust. But he does not abandon mindful eating. This means that if he consumes mindful food due to medication or any other reason, it is not prohibited for him, because he does not reject mindful eating. The duration of this Pratima is at least one, two, or three days and at most six months. This means that if someone dies before six months after taking the vow or takes initiation, that is his duration. If someone observes these rules for life, it is not prohibited. He can follow them as much as he can, according to his own will. However, there is definitely a special amount of Abhigraha, and it should be there. The path of the Upasaka is mostly spent in the path of Yoga:

Now the Sutrakar describes the subject of the seventh Pratima:

Ahavaara Sattama Uvasaga-Padima | Savva-Dhamma-Rui Yavi Bhavati | Jao Raovaraayam Va Bhambhayari Sachittahare Se Parinnaae

It is. In the beginning, it is not abandoned. He, while dwelling in this way, with this kind of conduct, for at least one day, two days, three days, or up to seven months, with increasing intensity, he dwells. This is the seventh *Uvasaga-padimaa*. ||7||

Then, the next, the seventh *Upasaka-pratima*. He has a liking for all religions. As long as he is a celibate, both during the day and night, his conscious eating is known. His beginning is not known. He, while dwelling in this way, with this kind of conduct, for at least one day, two days, three days, or up to seven months, with increasing intensity, he dwells. This is the seventh *Upasaka-pratima*. ||7||

**Word Meaning:**

After this, the seventh *Uvasaga-padimaa*/*Upasaka-pratima* is explained. The one who takes on this *pratima* has a liking for all religions. As long as he is a celibate, both during the day and night, his conscious eating is known. In the beginning, he does not abandon his sinful occupations like agriculture. He, while dwelling in this way, with this kind of conduct, for at least one day, two days, three days, or up to seven months, with increasing intensity, he dwells. This is the seventh *Uvasaga-padimaa*/*Upasaka-pratima*.

**Main Meaning:**

After this, the seventh *pratima* is explained. The one who takes on this *pratima* has a liking for all religions. He is always a celibate, both during the day and night. He abandons conscious eating, but cannot abandon his beginning (agriculture and other occupations). He dwells in this way, for at least one, two, or three days, or up to seven months, with increasing intensity. This is the seventh *Upasaka-pratima*.

He observes the **niratichar** (non-transgression). He particularly observes **brahmacharya** (celibacy) during the night and day. "**Raovarayam** (**Rauvaratti**m) or **Bhambhayari** - night, **Apigata Ratri** - night, **Aparatro** - day, **Ratri** and **Aparatra** - **Rajya Paratra** (the time between night and day), he observes **brahmacharya** in these. In addition to this, he also abandons **Sachitta Ahar** (food with attachment), meaning he only consumes food and water. However, he has not abandoned **Aaramh** (agriculture and other sinful businesses) - doing, causing to be done, and giving permission in this matter. Therefore, **Aaramh** is considered **Aparijnat** (unknown) for him.

The duration of this **Pratima** (image) is at least one, two, or three months, and at most seven months. For the duration between the lowest and the highest, the inquisitive should consider it themselves.

Now the Sutrakar (author of the sutra) speaks about the eighth **Pratima**:

**Ahavra Atthama Uvasag-Padima. Savva-Dhamm-Rui Yavi Bhavati. Jav Raovarayam Bhambhayari. Sachittahare Se Parinaae Bhavati. Aaramhe Se Parinnaae Bhavati. Pesaramhe Aparinnaae Bhavati.

**216**

**Mūlārtha** - After this, the eighth pratima is stated. The one who holds this pratima has interest in all religions. He, as long as night and day, follows the vow of Brahmacharya, abandons conscious food and beginning. But he does not abandon causing others to begin. Wandering in this way, he wanders for at least one, two, or three days, and at most eight months. This is the eighth Upasaka - Pratima.

**Tīkā** - In this sutra, the subject of the eighth Upasaka - Pratima is stated. The person entering this pratima follows all the rules from the first pratima to the seventh pratima without deviation. He especially remains a Brahmachari always and completely. Although he does not himself do agriculture and business, etc., he is not prohibited from causing others to do it. Therefore, he causes others to do these things for livelihood, he himself never engages in them.

Here, the question arises: When he causes other people to do agriculture, etc., does he not incur sin? In answer, it is said that there are three ways to commit sinful karma - doing, causing, and giving permission for sinful karma. Here, the rule is to not do sinful karma oneself. The remaining two karmas are not rules for him, but their sin certainly accrues to him.

The name of this pratima is 'Aarambha-Parityaaga' pratima. Its duration is a maximum of eight months. The rest of the rules should be known as before.

**With Hindi Commentary**

**Or -**  For three days, with great effort, and for nine months, with excellence, he should wander. This is the ninth **Uvasaga-Padima** (Upaasaka-Pratima).

**Original Meaning -** After this, the ninth Pratima is explained. The one who accepts this Pratima has an interest in all religions. He remains a celibate throughout the night and day. He abandons food and drink with awareness, and the initiation of eating and causing others to eat, but he does not abandon dedicated food. Through this type of wandering, he should worship this Pratima for at least one, two, or three days, and with excellence, for up to nine months. This is the ninth Upaasaka-Pratima.

**Commentary -** This Sutra does not explain the subject of the Pratima. The person who accepts this Pratima has an interest in all religions and follows all the rules up to the eighth Pratima. He does not abandon dedicated food, meaning he does not abandon the food prepared for the Shravaka, but rather accepts it. However, he neither initiates eating himself nor causes others to eat. But he has not abandoned the permission to eat, which is why he accepts dedicated food. Because although he entrusts the entire burden of the household to his capable son, etc., he still has affection for them and gives them permission from time to time. He worships the ninth Pratima for up to nine months. However, if he dies before nine months or takes initiation, then the time of the Pratima should be considered insignificant.

If it is asked, "What is the etymological and clear meaning of 'Uddishta-Bhakta'?" In the solution, it is said, "Uddishtam uddeshas tena kritam vihitam uddishta-kritam, tadartham sanskritamityarthaha. Tad cha - uddishta-krita-bhaktam, madhyamapadalopaduddishta-bhaktamiti bhavati. Tattasya pratimakartuh aparijnatam - apratyakhyatam bhavati, svamuddishya sanskritam bhakta-panam paribhogannayatiyarthaha." Meaning, he does not abandon the food made for him, but accepts it. It is not forbidden for the ninth Pratima-bearer.

**The tenth Upasaka-Pratima:**

This Upasaka-Pratima has an interest in all Dharma. He is known for his devotion to the prescribed practices. He may be either shaven-headed or have a topknot. He is capable of speaking two languages, such as saying "I know" when he knows something, and "I don't know" when he doesn't. He practices this type of conduct, being humble, for one day, two days, or three days, and even for ten months. This is the tenth Upasaka-Pratima. ||10||

**Sixth Dasha**

Now, another tenth Upasaka-Pratima. He has an interest in all Dharma. He is known for his devotion to the prescribed practices. He may be either shaven-headed or have a topknot. He is capable of speaking two languages, such as saying "I know" when he knows something, and "I don't know" when he doesn't. He practices this type of conduct, being humble, for one day, two days, or three days, and even for ten months. This is the tenth Upasaka-Pratima. ||10||

**Or** - For one day, two days, or three days, he wanders with increasing intensity, and for ten months, he wanders with increasing intensity. This is the tenth image of the devotee.

**Original Meaning** - After this, the tenth image of the devotee is explained. The one who adopts this image has an interest in all matters of religion. He is endowed with all the aforementioned qualities. He also abandons the designated devotee. He shaves his head with a razor but definitely wears a tuft of hair. When someone calls him once or many times, he can only give two answers - if he knows, he says, "I know this," and if he doesn't know, he says, "I don't know this." Wandering with this kind of behavior, he wanders from the lowest point for one day, two days, or three days, and up to ten months with increasing intensity. This is the tenth image of the devotee.

**Commentary** - This sutra describes the subject of the tenth image. The person who adopts this image follows all the rules of the previous nine images without deviation. He also abandons the designated devotee, meaning he does not even accept food prepared for him. This means he completely rejects the practice of Savadya Yoga. He shaves his head with a razor but definitely wears a tuft of hair, which is a symbol of a householder. This statement proves that while it is necessary for a householder to keep a tuft of hair, it is not necessary to wear a sacred thread (Yajnopaveet or Jinopaveet). Because if it were necessary, the Sthavira would have definitely mentioned it. The rule for the holder of the tenth image is that when asked about something once or many times, he can only give two types of answers. If he knows the subject, he can say, "I know this," and if he doesn't know, he can say, "I don't know." This means that if a relative comes to him and asks, "Are there any valuables like money deposited in such and such a place? Do you know anything about them?" If he knows, he should say, "I know," and if he doesn't know, he should say, "I don't know." He should answer only with yes or no. He is not allowed to say anything more. The commentator also says the same thing in this regard...

Page #292:
---------------------------
## 224
## Dasha-Shruta-Skandha Sutra

It is written: "The meaning of this Sutra is that before the tenth image is received, if any gold or other valuables are deposited in the ground, etc., then the sons, brothers, etc., should be asked if they know about it. If they know, then they should be told. If they do not know, then the income will be cut off. If they do not know, then they should say, 'I do not know anything.' After saying this, they should not be allowed to do any household work. This is the meaning." The meaning has already been explained. In this Sutra, the words 'api' and 'va' are used repeatedly. They are in conjunction or mutual expectation.

## Sixth Dasha

This image is described as lasting from one, two, or three days to ten months. This image actually describes the Jain Vanaprastha. The tenth and eleventh images are also in the form of Jain Vanaprastha.

Now the Sutrakar describes the subject of the eleventh image:

## Ahavaara Ekadasama Uvasaga-Padimaa

**Sava-Dhamma-Rui yaavi bhavathi.** **Jaa uditth-bhattam se nan khur-mundae va lutt-sirae va, gahiyaa-yaar-bhandaga-nevatthe.** **Jaarisae samanaanam nigganthaanam dhamme panatte, tam jaha sammam kaaran phaasemane, paalemane puro jugmaayae pehamane, datthuun tase paane uddhattu paae rieajja, sahattu paae ejja, tirichcham va paayam kattu rieajja, sati parakkamaejja, sanjayaameva parikkamaejja, no ujjuyam gachchejja, kevalam se naapejja-bandha avocchinnne bhavathi.** **Evam se kappathi naay vidhim vaitte.**

**With Hindi Commentary**

**225**

Seeing, having seen, trembling, he would lift his feet, he would gather his feet, he would cross his feet, he would strive with (the path), he would walk with restraint, he would walk with ease, only his love-bond with the Knower remains unbroken. Thus, he is worthy of being visited by the family.

**Word Meaning:**

After this, the eleventh (image) is expounded by the Upasaka. The interest in all Dharma-subjects is present in the Upasaka who is endowed with the eleventh (image). As long as the designated food is abandoned, he is (one) who has shaved his head with a razor or has his hair cut, he adopts the conduct, the utensils and the garb of the Sadhus. Just as the Dharma is expounded for the Shramanas and the Nirgranthas, he would walk, touching with his body, observing, looking ahead, seeing for a moment, seeing, trembling, he would lift his feet to protect (the beings), he would walk with his feet contracted, or he would cross his feet and walk, he would strive to walk when the path is present, he would walk with restraint, he would walk with ease. Only his love-bond with the Knower (his family) remains unbroken. Thus, he is worthy of being visited by the family.

**The word "Na" is in the sense of a figure of speech. And "Ya" is in the sense of a collection and "Avi" is in the sense of mutual dependence. In the same way, one should know everywhere.**

**Main Meaning:**

After this, the eleventh image is expounded. The Upasaka who is endowed with the eleventh image has an interest in all Dharma-subjects. He abandons the designated food, shaves his head with a razor or cuts his hair. He adopts the conduct, the utensils and the garb of the Sadhus. He observes the Dharma expounded for the Shramanas and the Nirgranthas,

Page #294:
---------------------------
##  226
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

He is diligent in touching and following the Dharma with his body. Seeing terrified beings, he lifts his feet to protect them. He walks with his feet contracted or sideways. He exerts himself diligently on the existing path, but does not walk straight without looking. He does not sever the bond of love with his family, therefore he goes to them for alms, meaning he can only beg from his family.

## Sixth Dasha

**Commentary:** This Sutra describes the eleventh pratima. The one who accepts this pratima follows all the rules from the first to the tenth pratima diligently. He completely abandons the desired object of devotion and shaves his head with a razor or plucks his hair. Shaving the head with a razor or plucking the hair is specifically prescribed for him. Therefore, the Sutra says, "Lutta-shiroja, veti vikalpārtha keshalunchan-karo vā." The word "vā" means that if he has the strength, he should pluck his hair, if he does not have the strength, he should shave his head with a razor. He should wear the attire of a sadhu - a cloth on his face, a dustpan in his armpit, a loincloth and a cloth wrapped around his waist. Wearing this attire, he should carry the paraphernalia of a sadhu, such as a begging bowl, and follow the Dharma as laid down for the Shramanas, without any deviation.

The Sutra says that he should touch the Dharma with his body. The word "kāya" means that he should not only touch the Dharma with his mind, but also follow it diligently with his body and avoid any transgression. While walking in this way, if he encounters terrified beings on the path, he should leave that path and take another path.

Now the question arises, what should he do if there is no other path? The Sutrakar himself answers this, for example, if there is no other path...

Page #295:
---------------------------
## Sixth Chapter
## With Hindi Commentary

**227**

If so, then he should strive to walk on that path. Upon seeing a terrified creature, he should first look at the ground for a distance of a *yuga-maatra*. Even then, if a terrified creature is visible, he should lift his feet or contract them and walk slowly. "**Tirinchham-tiryag va padau vidhay parshvatah padanyasam kritvetyartha**" - meaning, he should walk with his feet sideways, along the edges. The meaning of this statement is that he should engage in the act of walking with *irya-samiti* in such a way that no harm is caused to those creatures. However, he should not walk with ease without seeing the creatures. Because, like a virtuous person, he should engage in every action with effort. If he engages in actions like walking without effort, then there is a fear of both restraint and the soul being violated. The essence of the entire statement is that he must follow the virtuous path in every way.

Even while practicing virtuous conduct in every way, he still has a bond of love with his own clan (caste). He does not become completely free from them. His bond of love with them does not break. Therefore, it is appropriate for him to beg for alms only from his own people. The conclusion is that, while following the right path, the virtuous person, due to his unbroken bond of love with his clan, begs for alms from them. This also proves that only the devotee endowed with the aforementioned qualities can earn a living by begging for alms from his own clan, not anyone else. Another point that emerges from this is that the devotee who has a bond of love with his clan will beg for alms from them, but the one who has broken that bond can also beg from an unknown clan. That is why the sutra repeatedly states that the monk can beg from an unknown clan.

In the next sutra, the sutra-maker describes how a monk who carries an image should accept alms when he goes to his own clan for alms.

**Tath se puvvagamane-nam puvautte chaulodane pacchautte bhilin-suve, kappati se chaulodane padigghitte, no se kappati bhilin-suve padigghitte.** **Tath nam se puvvagamane-nam puvautte**

In that house, if the householder has prepared rice before the ascetic arrives and mung soup afterwards, then the ascetic is allowed to accept the rice but not the mung soup. If the mung soup is prepared before the ascetic arrives and the rice afterwards, then the ascetic is allowed to accept the mung soup but not the rice. If both the rice and mung soup are prepared after the ascetic arrives, then the ascetic is not allowed to accept either. If the rice is prepared before the ascetic arrives, then the ascetic is allowed to accept it. If the mung soup is prepared after the ascetic arrives, then the ascetic is not allowed to accept it.

If rice is cooked and taken off the fire before the arrival of the monk, then it is not appropriate to accept it. If it is cooked before the monk's arrival, then it should be accepted. If it is cooked after the monk's arrival, then it is not appropriate to accept it.

**Original Meaning:** A devotee goes to a householder's house for alms. If the rice is cooked before the devotee arrives and the lentils are not cooked, then the devotee should accept the rice, not the lentils. If the lentils are cooked before the devotee arrives and the rice is cooked after the devotee arrives, then the devotee should accept the lentils, not the rice. If both items are cooked before the devotee arrives, then the devotee can accept both. If both items are cooked after the devotee arrives, then the devotee cannot accept either. The devotee can accept the item that is cooked before the devotee arrives, but cannot accept the item that is cooked after the devotee arrives.

**Commentary:** This sutra describes the subject of the "Aeshna-Samiti". Just as a virtuous person should accept alms without fault, the same is said about the conduct of a Shraman devotee. The devotee should also accept alms only under specific rules. For example, when the devotee goes to the homes of people of their own caste for alms, they should be mindful that they only have the right to accept items that were cooked before their arrival and taken off the fire and placed in a clean place. However, the devotee cannot accept items that are cooked after their arrival. For example, if the rice is cooked before the devotee arrives and the lentils are about to be cooked, or if the lentils are cooked and the rice is about to be cooked, then the devotee can accept the already cooked rice or lentils, but not the ones that are being cooked. In summary, the devotee can accept items that are prepared before their arrival, but cannot accept items that are prepared after their arrival. This is just information. A detailed discussion...

## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
One should know the rules of food intake. The meaning is that one can only consume pure food that is free from 42 defects.

## Sixth Dasha
In this Sutra, the word "Puvvagamaneṇam" uses the third case in the sense of the seventh case, which means "before arrival". In the Ardha-Magadhi-Kosh, it is translated as "Purvagaman" in Sanskrit. The word "Puvvauutte (Purvayuktaḥ)" means "cooked before being known". "Bhilingsuv" refers to mung beans and other lentils. This word here generally refers to all kinds of lentils. Similarly, one should know about rice. They also refer to all kinds of food, drink, edibles, and tasty items here. The essence of the whole statement is that the Shramanopasak who has attained the Pratimā should consume food that is free from defects, like the Sadhus. These tenth and eleventh Pratimās are the Jain Vanaprastha forms. In fact, these are called Jain Vanaprastha.

Now the Sutrakar describes how the Shramanopasak should beg for alms when going for alms:
"Tass ṇam Gāhāvai - Kulāṁ Piṇḍavāy-Paḍiyāe Aṇuppaviṭṭhass Kappati Evam Vadditte "Samaṇovāsagass Paḍimā Paḍivannass Bhikkhaṁ Dalayha". Taṁ Ceva Eyārūveṇa Vihāreṇa Viharāmaṇe ṇam Kei Pāsittā Vadjjā "Kei Āuso Tumāṁ Vattavvaṁ Siyā", "Samaṇovāsae Paḍimā Paḍivaṇṇae Ahamaṁsīti" Vattavvaṁ Siyā.

**With Hindi Commentary**

For one who has entered the householders' family with the vow of **piṇḍapāta** (alms-round), it is appropriate to say, "Give alms to the **śramaṇopāsaka** who has attained the **pratimā** (image)."  

When someone sees him wandering with such a **vihāra** (conduct), he may ask, "Who are you, **āyusman**?"  He should reply, "I am a **śramaṇopāsaka** who has attained the **pratimā**."  And he should wander with such a **vihāra** for at least one day, or two days, or three days, or up to eleven months with excellence.  This is the **ekādaśyopāsaka-pratimā** (eleventh **upāsaka-pratimā**). ||11||

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Sixth Dasa
When the Śramaṇopāsaka (lay follower) enters the house of a householder, he should speak in the following manner: "Give alms to the Pratimā-pratipanna Śramaṇopāsaka (Śramaṇopāsaka who has attained the eleventh pratimā)." While wandering in this manner, if someone asks him, "O venerable one! Who are you?" then he should say, "I am the Pratimā-pratipanna Śramaṇopāsaka, and this is my nature." Wandering in this manner, he may do so for a minimum of one, two, or three days, and at the most up to eleven months. This is the eleventh pratimā of the Śramaṇopāsaka. The venerable Sthaviras have expounded these eleven pratimās of the Upāsaka (lay follower). Thus, I say. The Sixth Dasa is concluded.

Commentary: This sūtra describes the eleventh pratimā-pratipanna Śramaṇopāsaka. When the Śramaṇopāsaka who has attained the eleventh pratimā goes to the house of a householder for alms, he should say, "Give alms to the Pratimā-pratipanna Śramaṇopāsaka." If someone asks him who he is at that time, he should reply that he is the Pratimā-pratipanna Śramaṇopāsaka, and this is his nature, meaning that he abides in this form.

## Sixth Stage

**With Hindi Commentary**

**233**

If someone sees the **Shramanopasak**'s **chotti** (topknot) and asks, "O great one, who are you? You have a **mukhapatti** (mouth covering) and all the signs of a **sadhu** (saint), but you also have a **chotti** on your head," then the **Shramanopasak** should reply, "O **Ayushman** (blessed one), I am a **Pratima-prapta Shramanopasak**." This will clear the questioner's doubts and the **Shramanopasak** will avoid **stena-bhava** (the state of being a thief).

Deceiving people by pretending to be like them is also considered theft. Such a person is called a **rupa-chor** (form thief). There are many types of thieves, as the saying goes: "**Tav-tene vay-tene ruv-tene y je nare. Ayar-bhava-tene y kuvvai dev-kivise.**" This means that a thief of austerity, a thief of speech, a thief of conduct, and a thief of emotions are all considered thieves. Here, as mentioned earlier, a **Shramanopasak** who begs without revealing his identity is called a **rupa-chor** because his appearance is exactly like that of a **sadhu**. Therefore, to avoid the sin of theft, he must reveal his identity.

This sutra also clearly establishes that **moksha** (liberation) cannot be attained through knowledge alone, nor through action alone. Therefore, "**Jnana-kriyabyam moksha:**" liberation can be attained only by combining knowledge and action. This is why the first two **prati-mas** (stages) describe **samyag-darshan** (right faith) and **samyag-jnana** (right knowledge), while the remaining nine describe **charitra** (conduct). Not only this, but the eleventh **pratima** is also called "**Samane Bhue**" (**Shramanobhuta**). Here, the word "**bhuta**" is used in the sense of "being like." Therefore, the actions of someone who has attained this **pratima** are almost identical to those of a **sadhu**. There is no difference between their begging, writing, and other actions. The rest of the time, they spend in **svadhyaya** (self-study) and **dhyana** (meditation). However, it should be remembered that **arta-dhyana** (distressed meditation) and **raudra-dhyana** (angry meditation) should always be avoided.

Now the question arises: what is the nature of **arta-dhyana** and **raudra-dhyana**? The answer is that when someone desires a particular **pudgala dravya** (material substance) and fails to obtain it, they resort to finding ways to harm others to fulfill their desire. This is called **arta-dhyana** or **raudra-dhyana**. Not getting what one desires, getting what one dislikes, constantly worrying about illness, and being obsessed with desired pleasures are all examples of **arta-dhyana** and **raudra-dhyana**.

Page #302:
---------------------------
## 234
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

**Being engrossed in desires is the cause of the origin of Artha Dhyana.** The feeling of fear due to not getting the desired object, the feeling of violence towards stationary beings, the feeling of falsehood, and the feeling of stealing, always having the desire to dominate others, feeling jealous of others' progress and the intention to hinder it, are the causes of the origin of Roudra Dhyana.

**Sixth Dasha**

The Shramanopasaka should abandon these Dhyanas and spend his time in Dharma Dhyana, because he has to separate his soul from worldly activities. Therefore, he should remain separate from the aforementioned Dhyanas and, while practicing Bhiksha-Vriti (begging for food) in a useful way, should follow the eleventh pratima. Its duration is from one day, two days, or three days at the lowest, and up to eleven months at the highest. That is, if the Shramanopasaka who has attained the eleventh pratima dies before eleven months or becomes a Dikshit, then the duration will be the lowest or middle. And if neither of these happens, then he will have to follow it for eleven months with the aforementioned Abhigraha.

In this way, the elder Bhagavants have established eleven Upasaka Pratimas.

Here, the question arises: Should one become a Dikshit only after observing the eleven Pratimas, or can one become a Dikshit before that? In response, it is said that if it happens in this way, then it is very good. Because, just as there is a provision for four Ashramas - Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha, and Sannyasa or Yati - in non-Jain religions, so too is it in Jainism. But generally, the statement is found: "Tatah pratimaakaranamantrenapi pravrajya samyagbhavati," meaning that even without observing the Pratimas, one can become a Dikshit. But this statement is an exception. Shri Gautam, etc., Ganadharas and Jambu Kumar, etc., Mahamunis became Dikshits without observing the Pratimas. Generally, if someone wants to become a Dikshit after observing the Pratimas, then they can, but this rule is not necessary. Regarding Dharma-Kiryas, the Sutrakar writes: "Samayam goyam! Ma pamayaye," meaning that one should not be negligent even for a moment in Dharma-Kiryas. However, there is no provision in the Sutras that one should become a Dikshit only after observing the Pratimas. Rather, there are statements that one should never delay in performing religious duties. For example, when Shri Bhagavan Arishta Nemiji had Gajasukumar, etc., and Shri Shraman Bhagavan Mahavira Swami had...

Page #303:
---------------------------
## Sixth Chapter
### With Hindi Commentary

When Meghkumar and others were present to receive initiation, the Lord said, "Ahasuhum Devanuppiya Ma Padibandham Kareh" (O beloved of the gods! Do not delay in the act of initiation and other religious duties, as it brings happiness to your soul). However, He did not say that you should first adopt the eleven images of the Shramanopasaka. From these statements, it is clearly understood that these images are the epitome of the householder's dharma. Those Shravakas who do not consider themselves capable of receiving initiation should make their lives successful through these images.

The question arises that no one can follow the rules of the above eleven images nowadays. Because the first image requires alternate fasting, the second requires two, and so on, up to eleven fasts for eleven months. If this is not impossible, it is certainly difficult. In response, it is said that the rules of vows are not mentioned in the Sutras, hence they are not authentic. Just as the Sutras elaborate on other rules, if there were rules for vows, they would have been mentioned in the same way. Therefore, it is proven that the rules of tapas are not authentic because they are not mentioned in the Sutras. However, if an image-bearing devotee wishes to perform tapas in addition to the rules of the image, it is up to their discretion. An image-bearing devotee should strive to follow the rules of their image.

235

The names of these eleven images are given in the eleventh Samavay of the 'Samavayanga Sutra' as follows:

"Ekkaras Uvasag-Padimao Pannaattao. Tam Jaha - Dansan - Savae; Kay-Vay-Kamme; Samai-a - Kade; Posho-Vvas - Nirae; Diya Bambahyari; Ratti - Pariman - Kade; Diya Vi Rao Vi Bambahyari; Asinai; Viyad - Bhoei; Moli - Kade; Sachitt - Parinnae Aarambh - Parinnae; Pes - Parinnae; Uddiṭṭh - Bhatt - Parinnae; Saman-Bhue Aavi Bhavai Samanau-so."

Darshan-Shravaka; Krit-Vrat-Karma; Krit-Samayika; Poushadhopavas-Nirata; Diwa Brahmachari, Ratrau Pariman-Krit; Divaapi Ratravapi Brahmachari, Asnayi, Diwabhoji, Abaddhaparidhan-Kachchaka; Sachittahar-Parijnataka; Aarambh-Parijnataka; Presya-Parijnataka; Uddiṣṭhabhakt-Parijnataka; Shraman-Bhut-Sadhukalpa, meaning:

A person who follows the rules of the country should adopt as many images as they can.

Page #304:
---------------------------
##  The Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra (Chapter 236)

**The question arises: Is it a sin to give alms to a Shraman who worships an image?**

The answer is that the fruit of charity depends on the recipient (patra). Just as the type of seed sown in a field determines the type of fruit, similarly, the fruit of charity will be determined by the recipient - whether they are a worthy (su-patra) or unworthy (ku-patra) recipient. 

As it is said: "O Jambu Swami! What happens to a Shraman or a Brahman who receives food, drink, clothing, and shelter from a person who is not worthy? It is a sin! It is not a good deed."

**Sixth Dasha**

This Sutra uses the terms "Shraman" and "Mahan."  Abhaydeva Suri explains these terms as follows: "Mahan" means one who does not kill living beings (sthula-pranatipat-nivritatva).  Therefore, a Mahan or a Brahman is one who has renounced the world (desh-virat).

In other words, giving food to a Shraman or Mahan who is not worthy (asuk) is a sin. The rest should be understood by oneself.

**The total duration of all the images is five and a half years.** After this period, the devotee either becomes a monk (dikshit) or takes on another image. If one knows the time of their death, they can ascend to heaven through fasting (anashan).  Like the great merchant Kartik, a devotee can take on many images. Although they can return to the householder's life after fulfilling the rules, this practice is not generally considered good. Therefore, after observing the image, one should spend the rest of their life in devotion and meditation.

**O Jambu Swami!**

Thus, Shri Sudharma Swami says to Shri Jambu Swami:

"O Jambu Swami! Just as I have heard the meaning of this Dasha from the mouth of Shri Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira Swami, I have told you the same. I have not added anything from my own intellect."

Page #305:
---------------------------
## Seventh Dasha

The sixth Dasha described the images of the Shramanopasaka. Now, the Sutrakar describes the images of the Bhikshu in this seventh Dasha. Because, the person who wants to adopt the character of all-virtue-form, must enter the Bhikshu-ashram. Therefore, this Dasha describes the Bhikshu's possessions. This is the connection of this Dasha with the previous ones.

There are many images of the Bhikshu, such as Samadhi-pratima, Vivek-pratima, Upadhan-pratima, Prati-sanlinata-pratima, Ekaki-vihar-pratima, Yavamdhya-pratima, Chandra-pratima, Vajramdhya-pratima, Bhadra-pratima, Maha-bhadra-pratima, Samudra-pratima, Sarvatomha-bhadra-pratima, Shruta-pratima, Charitra-pratima, Vaiyavrutya-pratima, Sapta-pindeshana-pratima, Sapta-paneshana-pratima, and Kayotsarga-pratima, etc. But all of these are included in the Shruta and Charitra-pratima. Because, all other images are just different forms of these two. The Bhikshu should achieve his goal through the images, including their differences and sub-differences. That is, his goal should be to destroy karma and attain his desired Nirvana through them.

Keeping this subject in mind, the Sutrakar has created the seventh Dasha. Its initial Sutra is:

"Suyam me, Ausam, Tenam Bhagavaya Evam Akhayam, Ih Khalu Therahin Bhagavantehin Baras Bhikshu-Padimao Panna Tao. Kayara Khalu"

**Bhiksu-Padimaa-Bhiksu-Pratima Aho-Raim-Diya-Ek Ratri Aur Din Ki Bhiksu-Padimaa-Bhiksu-Pratima Eg-Raiya-Ek Ratri Ki Bhiksu-Pratima.**

**Meaning:** There are seven pratimaas from one month to seven months. The eighth, ninth, and tenth pratimaas are for seven days and nights each. The eleventh is for one day and night, and the twelfth is for only one night.

**Commentary:** This sutra describes the twelve pratimaas. For example, the first pratimaa is for one month, the second for two months, and the third for three months. Similarly, the seventh is for seven months. The eighth, ninth, and tenth pratimaas are for seven days and seven nights each, the eleventh is for one day and night, and the twelfth is for one night.

Now the question arises that if the first pratimaa is for one month, the second for two months, and so on, the seventh for seven months, then these seven pratimaas would take two years and four months. This would mean that the pratimaas would have to be abandoned during Chaturmas, because without them, the rules of vihara, etc., cannot be followed during Chaturmas. In response, it is said that each pratimaa should be considered as one month. This way, the calculation shows that the seven pratimaas would take only seven months, and the eighth, ninth, and tenth pratimaas would take a total of twenty-one days, the eleventh one day, and the twelfth one night. This way, all the pratimaas can be completed before Chaturmas. The pratimadhari bhiksu can separate from the gachchha and complete the pratimaas within eight months, and then rejoin the gachchha during Chaturmas.

The sutra says "do-maasia (dvi-maasiki) meaning two months, similarly three months, etc." One might ask if the second pratimaa should be for two months and the third for three months, because this is the meaning that comes from the words of the sutra. The meaning of the sutra is correct, but it should be noted that the time of the previous pratimaas is also included in each pratimaa. This means that in the second pratimaa, one month of the first pratimaa should also be counted. Similarly, in the third pratimaa, two months of the first two pratimaas and one month of its own should be counted. This way, there is no difference in the meaning of the sutra. In reality, each pratimaa is for one month only. If it is not considered this way, then...

## Seventh Stage

With Hindi Commentary.

If this order is followed, it must also be followed for the eighth, ninth, and subsequent images. Following this order, the twelfth image will be completed in twelve months. The commentator also writes about this in the same way. For example:

“When the seventh-month image is completed, the field suitable for the rainy season retreat is recorded. It creates the condition for the rainy season retreat. And it comes from the rule, it becomes bound. All these are completed in eight months. The three images are completed in one year, and the six months of circumambulation are completed in six months. The number of images is equal to the number of circumambulations. The circumambulation for the monthly image is one month. Similarly, the circumambulation for the seventh-month image is seven months. The duration of the circumambulation is the time of the circumambulation. The fourth and subsequent images, which are above the three, have their circumambulation in one year and their completion in another year. The images are completed in auspicious substances, fields, time, and conditions. The three images are seven nights and days. Thus, twenty-one nights and days are circumambulated, and the images are completed in the same number of days. In this way, the eighth, ninth, and tenth images are completed on the twenty-first day. The eleventh is completed in three nights and days, and the twelfth is completed in one night and day, along with the sixth. Here, the word "night and day" refers only to the night, otherwise it would contradict the sutra "one night." The thirteenth is completed in four nights and days, along with the eighth. The meaning is clear.

The monk who holds the image is full of mental and physical strength, and therefore he can follow these images correctly. In this way, by enduring physical hardships, he gains spiritual strength. This is beneficial for him, because spiritual strength is the greatest of all the forces in the world. By gaining the strength of right faith, he can properly worship right conduct.

Now the sutra-maker describes the necessary duties of the images, saying:

"The monk who has taken the vow of non-violence, who is a householder, who is constantly engaged in the practice of non-violence, and who has a pure body, if he encounters any obstacles, whether they are divine, human, or animal, he endures them, tolerates them, bears them, and is patient."

* Tirikkha joonia - animal
* Tan - those
* Uvvanne - arisen
* Sammam - properly
* Sahati - bears
* Khami - forgives
* Titikkhati - endures
* Ahiyaaseti - remains steadfast

**Meaning:**

A monk who has taken the monthly vow, is homeless, has abandoned the body, and has given up attachment to the body, if he experiences any afflictions, whether divine, human, or animal, he bears them with equanimity, forgives them, endures them, and remains steadfast.

**Commentary:**

This sutra describes the rules for a monk who has taken the vow. When a monk takes the first vow, it is appropriate for him to abandon his bodily attachments and endure afflictions. Although a monk abandons his bodily attachments when he takes the vow, he should pay special attention to this when taking the vow. Therefore, the sutra uses the terms "vyutsrusht-kaay" and "tyakt-deh" to describe him. For example, "nityam - continuously, day and night, vyutsrusht-kaay - having abandoned the body, because he has abandoned the body, chiyattadeh - having given up attachment to the body, because he has given up attachment to the body, etc." In other words, he has abandoned the body because he has abandoned the body, and he has given up attachment to the body because he has endured afflictions. He endures afflictions that are divine, human, and animal.

**With Hindi Commentary**

Upon arising, he should bear them well. A monk who has taken the vow of non-attachment should bear adversities (sudden misfortunes) in the same way a newly married bride silently endures the words of her in-laws. At that time, he should possess the strength to bear all hardships (afflictions), both favorable and unfavorable, with forgiveness and a spirit of non-attachment. He can bear them. For one who has abandoned the hope of life and the fear of death, bearing hardships is not a difficult task. He should wander, bearing them with a steady mind. Now the sutra-maker describes the same subject again:

**243**

A monk who has taken the vow of non-attachment, who has taken the vow of non-attachment, is eligible to receive one gift of food and one gift of drink. He is eligible to receive these from an unknown person, a pure person, a person who has renounced many bipeds, quadrupeds, ascetics, Brahmanas, guests, poor people, and forest dwellers. He is eligible to receive these from one who eats alone. He is not eligible to receive these from two, three, four, five, or a woman who is a teacher, or a child, or a pregnant woman, or a woman who is carrying a child in her womb and is being crushed by two feet, or a woman who is carrying a child in her womb and is being crushed by two feet outside, or a woman who is carrying a child in her womb and is being crushed by one foot inside and one foot outside, or a woman who is carrying a child in her womb and is being crushed by one foot inside and one foot outside. If she is crushed in this way, she is not eligible to receive these.

A monk should not accept food from a pregnant woman, nor from a woman with a young child, nor from a woman who is giving milk to her child. He should not accept food from a woman who is giving food with both her feet inside the doorway, nor from a woman who is giving food with both her feet outside the doorway. He should accept food from a woman who is giving food with one foot inside the doorway and one foot outside the doorway. This is how a monk should accept food. If a woman does not give food in this way, then a monk should not accept food from her.
Word Meaning- A monk should accept one food and one water from a monthly-period-observing, image-bearing, renounced householder. It is appropriate to accept from an unknown family, pure

And one should take only a small amount, and only when a human, animal, ascetic, Brahmin, guest, miser, and beggar are taking it, then it is appropriate for the ascetic to take it. One should take it from where food is prepared for one person. But one should take it from where it is not prepared for two, three, four, five, a pregnant woman, a woman with a child. One should not take it from a woman who is breastfeeding her child (and keeps it separate while giving alms). One should not take it from someone whose both feet are inside the threshold or both feet are outside. One should only take alms from someone who has one foot inside the threshold and one foot outside, i.e., who keeps the threshold between their two feet. But one should not take it from someone who does not give in this way.
Commentary- This sutra describes the rules of acceptance (vows) in relation to the substance, time, place, and feeling of a monk who observes the monthly vow. A monk who observes the monthly vow should accept one offering of food and one offering of water.
Here the question arises, "What is meant by 'offering'?" In answer, it is said that the word 'offering' is used in the sense of donation. It is the form of the 'kti' suffix in the sense of the 'da' root. When the giver starts giving food or water in the ascetic's bowl, as long as the unbroken stream of the given substance continues, it is called 'offering'. When the stream is broken, the 'offering' ends. In this way, the number of offerings is determined. The commentator writes about this: "There, donation is offering, 'kti' suffix in the sense of 'offering'. And that is one offering, so one offering, once the householder gives food and water to the ascetic with an unbroken stream, that is one offering. Similarly, when the giver gives with an unbroken stream of alms, then it is the first. And when the stream is broken and given, then it is the second, and so on." Here, many types of distinctions arise. For example: 1-one-alms-one-offering 2-one-alms-many-offerings 3-many-alms-one-offering 4-many-alms-many-offerings (ordinary food). In this way, many distinctions are formed.

##  Chapter 246, Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra, Seventh Dasha

It is stated that a monk who has received the image (pratima) should take only one datti of water per month. However, a monk from an unknown lineage should take only a small amount. Just as beggars collect a little grain at a time, so should he collect a little from each house. In this way, the monk should sustain himself through material possessions (abhigraha) and then through the field (kshetra). When a monk goes to receive alms, if both feet of the householder are inside the doorway, he should not take alms. Even if both feet are outside, it is not appropriate to take alms. However, if one foot is inside the doorway and the other outside, he can accept alms. If alms are not available in this way, he should not take them.

Similarly, while sustaining himself through material possessions (abhigraha), he should also sustain himself through time (kala). This will be discussed in detail in the next sutra. The implication is that a monk who has received the image (pratima) should strictly follow the rules.

A monk who sustains himself through material possessions (abhigraha) should go for alms when many people, animals, birds, ascetics (nirgrantha, Shakyas, tapas, gairika, jivaka, the five types of ascetics), Brahmins, guests, poor people (daridri), beggars (vanipka), etc., have already gone for alms. In this way, the negative karma of their obstruction is delayed. He should go to the same house where only one person's food is prepared. However, he should not accept alms from a house where food is prepared for two, three, four, five, or more people. Similarly, he should not accept food prepared for a pregnant woman, nor should he take food from the hands of a pregnant woman. This is because movement can cause pain to the unborn child. It is worth considering that if a Jina-kalpi monk knows through his quick wisdom that a particular woman is pregnant, he should not accept alms from her hands from that moment onwards. However, a sthavira-kalpi monk can accept alms from her before the eighth month of pregnancy. However, he should stop accepting alms from her when the eighth month begins. This rule is only established for the sake of following the principle of non-violence (ahimsa). It is proven that one should not accept alms from the hands of a pregnant woman. If a woman with a child offers alms after keeping the child separate, he should not accept them either. This is because the child may suffer from being separated from its mother.

---------------------------
## Seventh Chapter

**With Hindi Commentary**

**247**

There is a fear of attack from animals like cats. Similarly, if a woman is breastfeeding a child and starts begging after weaning the child, the monk should not accept the alms. Because this leads to the fault of *antaraya*. All these *abhigrahas* are done for the sake of self-welfare.

Now the question arises: What should a monk do if a man has prepared food for himself in a forest or if there is a large hall in a city without a threshold? In answer to this, it is said that even if there is no threshold and the giver's posture is such that he has one foot inside the threshold and one outside, then the monk can accept alms from him. Similarly, one should know about mountains, etc.

Now the Sutrakar describes *kalaabhigraha* and says:

**1.1**  *Maasiyam nam bhikku-padim padivannassa anagaarassa tao goyar-kaala pannatta. Tam jaha-adim majjhe carime. Adim charejjā, no majjhe charejjā, no carime charejjā. **1.2** Majjhe charejjā, no adim charejjā, no carime charejjā. **1.3** Carime charejjā, no adim charejjā, no majjhime charejjā.*

**Meaning:** For a monk who has taken the vow of *pratipanna* and is an *anagara*, three *gochar-kala* are prescribed. These are: *adim*, *majjhe*, and *carime*. If he goes in the *adim*, he should not go in the *majjhe* or *carime*. If he goes in the *majjhe*, he should not go in the *adim* or *carime*. If he goes in the *carime*, he should not go in the *adim* or *majjhe*.

**Word by Word Meaning:** *Maasiyam* - monthly, *bhikku-padim* - monk's vow, *padivannassa* - who has taken the vow, *anagaarassa* - of an *anagara*, *tao* - three, *goyar-kaala* - *gochar-kala*, *pannatta* - prescribed. *Tam jaha* - as, *adim* - beginning, *majjhe* - middle, *carime* - end. If he goes in the *adim* - *adim charejjā*, he should not go in the *majjhe* - *no majjhe charejjā*, he should not go in the *carime* - *no carime charejjā*. If he goes in the *majjhe* - *jaii majjhe charejjā*, he should not go in the *adim* - *no adim charejjā*, he should not go in the *carime* - *no carime charejjā*.

##  Chapter 248, Seventh Dasha, Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

**If one goes in the beginning, one should not go in the middle or the end. If one goes in the middle, one should not go in the beginning or the end. If one goes in the end, one should not go in the beginning or the middle.**

**Meaning:** This sutra explains the three parts of the day - beginning, middle, and end - for the time of going out for alms (gochari) for a monk who has taken the vow of non-attachment (anagari) and has a monthly vow (masiki). If one goes out for alms in the beginning part of the day, one should not go out in the middle or the end part. If one goes out in the middle part, one should not go out in the beginning or the end part. If one goes out in the end part, one should not go out in the beginning or the middle part.

**Commentary:** This sutra discusses the time of going out for alms for a monk who has taken the vow of non-attachment and has a monthly vow. There are three parts of the day for a monk's gochari: the first part, the second part, and the third part, which are the beginning, middle, and end parts of the day. If a monk goes out for alms in the first part of the day, he should not go out in the middle or the end part. Similarly, if he goes out in the end part, he should not go out in the beginning or the middle part. In other words, if a monk goes out in any one part of the day, he should not go out in the other two parts. Before going out for alms, each monk should know what time other monks are going out. He should not go out at the same time as them. However, this is ultimately up to his own discretion.

The question arises: what is "gochari"? The answer is that gochari is the act of receiving alms, similar to a cow grazing. Just as a cow grazes on grass, both high and low, without uprooting it, a monk should receive alms from all houses, both high and low, with equanimity and according to his rules. This ensures that the householder does not feel any distress. Therefore, the time for receiving alms is called gochari. When a monk goes to a householder's house for alms, his mind should be like that of a calf who takes food or water from the hand of a beautiful woman adorned with ornaments, but whose mind is focused only on the food and not on the woman's beauty or ornaments. Similarly, the monk's mind should be focused only on the alms and not on the householder's possessions.

Now the Sutrakar describes the same subject again:

**For a monk who has taken the vow of non-attachment, six types of gochari are prescribed for the monthly period.** These are: peta (square), ardhapeta (half-square), gomutrika (cow urine shaped), patang vihi (like the movement of a butterfly), sambukavatta (like the spiral of a conch shell), and gatva pratyagata (going and returning).

**Word by word meaning:**

* **Maasiyam:** Monthly
* **Bhikkhu-padimam:** Monk-image
* **Padivannassa:** Having taken the vow
* **Anagarassa:** Of a non-attached person
* **Chavviha:** Six types of
* **Gochariya:** Gochari
* **Pannatta:** Prescribed
* **Tam jaha:** Such as
* **Pela (da):** Square box
* **Addhapela (da):** Half-square box
* **Gomuttiya:** Cow urine shaped
* **Patang vihi:** Like the movement of a butterfly
* **Samvukkavatta:** Like the spiral of a conch shell
* **Gattu pacchagaya:** Going and returning

**Main meaning:**

Six types of gochari methods are prescribed for a non-attached monk during the monthly period. These are: peta shaped, ardhapeta shaped, gomutrika shaped, patang vihi shaped, sambukavatta shaped, and going and returning.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra describes the places for gochari. If the path (street, alley) is square shaped, then gochari should be done in that way. Where it is half-square shaped, gochari should be done in that way. Similarly, gochari should be done in the shape of a cow urine circle. Just as a butterfly flies and then sits down, similarly, a monk should take alms from one house, skip five to seven houses in between, and then take alms from another house. Just as a conch shell spirals, alms should be taken in that way. However, the spiral of a conch shell can be in two ways: right to left or left to right, clockwise or counter-clockwise, internal or external. The monk who has...

The *anagāra* who has accepted the *āvartaṇa* of a particular type should beg alms in the same way. They should go to the last house on the street and then return, begging alms. "Going and returning, they should beg alms in one row of houses, going and returning, they should do the same in the second row." The meaning of all this is that the *anagāra* who has accepted the *pratima* should strive to follow it in the matter of begging alms.

Now the Sutra-kāra describes the same subject:

"If a *bhikṣu-pratima* *anagāra* knows that a place is suitable, they may stay there for one night. If they do not know that a place is suitable, they may stay there for one night or two nights. They should not stay there for more than one night or two nights. Whoever stays there for more than one night or two nights, they should be *antarāchheda* or *parihāra*."

**Word-by-word meaning:**

* *Māsiyām* - monthly
* *Bhikṣu-paḍim* - *bhikṣu-pratima*
* *Paḍivannassa* - accepted
* *Anagārasa* - *anagāra*
* *Jattha* - where
* *Kei* - someone
* *Jāṇai* - knows
* *Kappati* - is suitable

## Seventh Chapter

**With Hindi Commentary**

**Verse 251**

**Meaning:** A monk who has taken the vow of non-attachment and is recognized in a place can stay for one night. If he is not recognized, he can stay for one or two nights. But staying for more than one or two nights is not appropriate. For every extra day he stays, he will have to perform a **Chhed** (atonement) or **Tap** (penance).

**Commentary:** This sutra speaks about the conduct of a monk who has taken the vow of non-attachment. If a monk who has taken the vow of non-attachment goes to a place where he is recognized, he can stay for one night. If he goes to a place where he is not recognized, he can stay for one or two nights. But if he stays longer, he will have to perform a **Chhed** or **Tap**. This is the traditional understanding.

However, the commentator writes: "If he stays for more than one or two nights, he should go to another village and stay there for some time before returning. He should not stay continuously in the same place. The word '**Parihar**' means to abandon the place. This sutra refers to nights, but it also implies days. Therefore, he can stay for a day and a night."

The meaning of this commentary is that if the monk wants to stay longer, he should go to another place for a while and then return. He should not stay continuously in the same place.

Now, the author speaks about the language of a monk who has taken the vow of non-attachment: "A monk who has taken the vow of non-attachment can speak in four ways: **Jayaani**, **Puchchhani**, **Anunnavvani**, and **Putthassa Vagarani**."

## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

A monk who has taken the vow of monthly begging (Maasik Bhikshu-Pratima) is allowed to speak four languages. These are:

* **Yaachani:** The language of requesting (for food, etc.)
* **Pruchhani:** The language of asking (for directions, etc.)
* **Anugyaapani:** The language of seeking permission (for a place to stay, etc.)
* **Pruthasya Vaagrani:** The language of answering questions.

**Seventh Dasha**

**Word-by-word meaning:**

* Maasikam - Monthly
* Bhikshu-Padimam - Monk - Image
* Padivannassa - Having taken the vow of begging
* Anagaara - Non-householder
* Chattari - Four
* Bhasaao - Languages
* Bhaasittae - To speak
* Kappati - Is allowed
* Tam jaha - As for example
* Yaachani - The language of requesting food, etc.
* Pruchhani - The language of asking for directions, etc.
* Anugyaapani - The language of seeking permission for a place to stay, etc.
* Putthasya Vaagrani - The language of answering questions.

**Main meaning:**

A monk who has taken the vow of monthly begging is allowed to speak four languages. These are: the language of requesting food, etc., the language of asking for directions, etc., the language of seeking permission for a place to stay, etc., and the language of answering questions.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra discusses the languages of a monk who has taken the vow of begging (Pratima-Pratipanna Anagaara). While a monk who has taken this vow should spend most of their time in silence, there are certain situations where they need to speak. The Sutra lays down rules for these situations, stating that a monk who has taken this vow is allowed to speak four languages. For example, when a monk goes out for alms and requests food, they should use the language of requesting. When they have doubts about something, they should use the language of asking to clarify the meaning. If they want to stay somewhere, they should use the language of seeking permission. If someone asks them a question, like "Who are you?", they should use the language of answering. 

Apart from these four reasons, they should not speak about anything else. This is because the main tool for meditation is silence. By remaining silent, a monk can meditate without any distractions. Therefore, they should only speak when absolutely necessary. The Sutra has outlined these four essential situations.

## Seventh Chapter
## With Hindi Commentary

The term 'yācanā' refers to the understanding of all the things that are fit for a sādhū to accept. Similarly, 'pṛcchana' implies asking questions about anything that is doubtful. In the same way, one should also know about asking permission for a place and answering others' questions. In summary, a muni should not speak except for these four topics.

Now the sūtra-kāra speaks about the topic of upāśraya:

**253**
**māsiyam ṇam bhikku-paḍimaṁ paḍivannassa kappati tao uvassayā paḍilehittae. taṁ jaha - ahe ārama-gihansi vā, ahe viyaḍ-gihansi vā, ahe rukkha-mūla-gihansi vā.**

## Chapter 7, Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

**The question arises: why did the Sutrakar use the word "adha" (below) with all three upashrayas (abodes)?**

The answer is that the word "adha" has a broader meaning here. The Vrittikar (commentator) has interpreted it as follows:

* "Adha-aram-griham" (below-comfort-house) is a house that is adorned below with comfort.
* Or, "adha-aram-griham" is a house where comfort is all around.
* Or, "adha-aram-griham" is a house that is below for dwelling and comfort.
* Or, "adha" is a general term, and it refers to a house that is a common place of comfort for all people.

As it is said:

> "Adha, suparama, chaiva, varjane lakshanadishu. Aalingane cha shoke cha, pujaayaam dosha-kirthane. Bhushaane sarvato bhaave, vyaapto nivasane'pi cha."

> (Below, excellent, and so on, in the characteristics of rejection. In embracing, in sorrow, in worship, in the mention of faults. In adornment, in all aspects, pervading, even in dwelling.)

In the text "adha aram-griham", it refers to "agaman-griham" (arrival-house), where the Karpatikas (Jain ascetics) come and reside. It is a house that is open on all sides, not covered from below due to the presence of a pit, and not covered from above due to the absence of a roof. Similarly, "vruksha-mul-griham" (tree-root-house) is a house that is located at the root of a tree. It is a good and faultless place to reside.

**Therefore, it is appropriate to mention these three types of houses for the Muni (Jain ascetic).**

The essence of the Vritti is that a house that has comfort all around is called "adha aram-griham". A house that is uncovered on all sides for visitors and covered from above is called "adha vikat (vivrut) griham" (below-terrible (open)-house). And a house that is located at the root of a tree is called "vruksha-mul-griham".

**It is established that the Muni should only mention these three types of houses.**

Now, the Sutrakar again describes the same topic:

> "Maasiyam nam bhikku-padimam padivannasya kappati tao uvasayaa anunnnavettae, ahe aram-giham, ahe viyad-giham, ahe rukkha-mul-giham."

> "Maasiyam nam bhikku-padimam padivannasya kappati tao uvasayaa uvainnittae, tam cheva."

> **Is it appropriate for a monk who has accepted the vows to allow three abodes: adha aram-griham, adha vivrut-griham, adha vruksha-mul-griham?**

A *bhiksu-pratima-pratipanna* (a monk who has accepted the image of a monk) is eligible to receive permission for three *upaashrayas* (abodes), and they are the same.

**Word Meaning:**

* *Maasiyam* - monthly
* *Bhiksu-padimam* - image of a monk
* *Padivanna* - accepted
* *Anugara* - non-householder

* *Uvaainittae* - to accept
* *Tam cheva* - and they are the same
* *Nam* - for the sake of *vakyaalankara* (figure of speech)

**Main Meaning:**

A monthly *bhiksu-pratima-pratipanna* non-householder should seek permission for three types of *upaashrayas*: a comfortable house, an open house, and a house at the root of a tree. A monthly *bhiksu-pratima-pratipanna* non-householder should accept only these three types of *upaashrayas*.

**Commentary:**

This sutra states that after accepting the *upaashrayas*, it is appropriate for a *pratima-pratipanna* non-householder to stay in them only after seeking permission from the owner of the *upaashraya*, because they are not allowed to stay without permission. It is also written, "It is appropriate to accept them for staying." Therefore, they should stay there only after seeking permission.

Now, the sutra-kar (author of the sutra) speaks about the *sanstara* (bedding):

* *Maasiyam nam bhiksu-padimam padivanna* is eligible for *santhara* after seeking permission. For example, a bed made of earth, stone, or wood.
* *Maasiyam nam bhiksu-padimam padivanna* is eligible for *santhara* after seeking permission. And they are the same.
* *Maasiyam nam bhiksu-padimam padivanna* is eligible for *santhara* after accepting it. And they are the same.

**Main Meaning:**

A monk who has accepted the *Bhiksu-Pratima* is eligible to use, request permission for, and accept three types of *Sanstaraka*: earth-stone, wood-stone, and whatever is already laid out.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra discusses the *Sanstaraka* of a monk who has accepted the *Pratima*. He should first see the three types of *Sanstaraka*: earth-stone, wood-stone, and whatever is already laid out (like *kusha* grass). Then he should request permission to use them, and only then should he accept them. He should accept them only after receiving permission. (Three *Sanstaraka* are considered eligible to be used and accepted).

Now the question arises: what is a *Sanstaraka*? The answer is that there are three types of *Sanstaraka*. As it is written in the *Kosa*: " *Santhaaraga* (masculine, *Sanstaraka*) is a bed of two and a half hands in length, made of *darbha* grass or a blanket."

The sutra under discussion describes what a muni should do if a woman or a man comes to his upashraya (abode).

Translation:

If a woman or a man approaches the upashraya of a muni who has taken the vow of a monthly mendicant (masika bhikkhu-pratima), he is not permitted to go out or enter (the upashraya) on account of that woman or man.

Padarthanvaya (Explanation of terms):
Masikam - Monthly
Bhikkhu-pratimam - Vow of a mendicant
Prativannaṣṣa - Of the one who has taken the vow
Anagara - Homeless ascetic
Upasayam - Upashraya (abode)
Itthī vā - Either a woman
Purise vā - Or a man
Upagacchejja - Approaches
Se - That (woman or man)
Itthīe vā - If a woman
Purise vā - Or a man
Na sa kappati - Is not permitted
Tam paducca - On account of that
Nikkhāmittāe vā - To go out
Pavesittāe vā - Or to enter

Meaning: If a woman or a man comes to the upashraya of a muni who has taken the vow of a monthly mendicant, he is not permitted to go out or enter (the upashraya) on account of that woman or man.

Commentary: This sutra describes what a muni should do if there is any improper conduct happening in the upashraya. For example, if the muni is staying in a secluded place and a man and a woman come there for sexual activity, then the muni, if he is outside, cannot enter, and if he is inside, cannot go out. He should maintain a detached attitude and continue his spiritual practices. If the man and woman are already engaged in sexual activity before the muni arrives, then the muni should not go to that place at all, nor should he stay there.

The sutra-kara (author) now speaks about leaving the upashraya in the context of the Agnikaya (fire element).

Dasha-Shrutskandha Sutra
If a monk who has attained the state of a *pratipanna* is in a dwelling that is being consumed by fire, it is not appropriate for him to leave the dwelling due to the fire or to enter it. If someone were to grab his arms and try to pull him out, it is not appropriate for him to hold onto or lean on that person. It is appropriate for him to walk away according to the rules of *iryasamiti*.

**Word-by-word meaning:**
* *Masian* - monthly
* *Bhikkhu-padimam* - monk-image
* *Padivannassa* - attained (the state of a *pratipanna*)
* *Kei* - someone
* *Uvassayam* - dwelling
* *Agnikaayena* - by fire
* *Jhaamejja* - burns
* *No se kappati* - it is not appropriate
* *Tam* - that (fire)
* *Paduccha* - due to
* *Nikkhamitta* - to leave

* *Palambitta* - to lean on
* *Kappati* - it is appropriate
* *Aharayam* - according to the rules of *iryasamiti*
* *Riyatta* - to walk

**Meaning:**
If a dwelling where a *pratipanna* monk is staying is consumed by fire, the monk should not leave the dwelling due to the fire or enter it if he is outside. However, if someone were to grab his arms and try to pull him out, it is not appropriate for him to hold onto or lean on that person. Instead, he should walk away according to the rules of *iryasamiti*.

**Commentary:**
This sutra explains what a *pratipanna* monk should do if the dwelling where he is staying catches fire. If the place where the monk is staying is on fire, he should not leave or enter the dwelling due to the fire.

---------------------------
## Seventh Chapter

**With Hindi Commentary**

If a fire breaks out in the place where a monk resides, or if someone sets it on fire, it is not appropriate for the monk to leave or enter the shelter due to fear of fire. However, if someone tries to pull him out by grabbing his arm, it is not appropriate for him to resist and stay there. Instead, according to the principle of *eirya-samiti*, it is appropriate to leave the place. This is because, having renounced attachment to the body and delusion, he cannot protect himself. If others try to pull him out, it is not appropriate to stubbornly stay there.

Now, the sutra-kar speaks about the *pratima-pratipanna* muni:

**256**

*Masian nu bhikku-padimam padivannas payansi khanu va kantae va hirea va sakkarae va anupavesejja no se kappi niharitte va visohitte va, kappati se ahariyam riyattae.*

**Word by Word Meaning:**

*Masian* - monthly *bhikku-padimam* - monk's *pratima* *padivannas* - who has renounced *payansi* - in the foot *khanu* - a piece of wood *va* - or *kantae* - a thorn *va* - or *hirea* - a diamond *va* - or *sakkarae* - a pebble *anupavesejja* - enters *no se kappi* - it is not appropriate for him *niharitte* - to remove *va* - or *visohitte* - to cleanse *va* - or *kappati* - it is appropriate *se* - for him *ahariyam* - according to *eirya-samiti* *riyattae* - to walk.

**Meaning:**

If a piece of wood, a thorn, a diamond, or a pebble enters the foot of a *pratima-pratipanna* monk, it is not appropriate for him to remove the thorn or cleanse the foot. According to the principle of *eirya-samiti*, it is appropriate for him to walk.

Instead, he should...

##  Chapter 260 of the Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

This Sutra explains what a Sadhu should do if they encounter an obstacle like a thorn while walking. When a Muni, who has taken the vow of non-attachment to the body, is engaged in walking according to their vow, and a thorn, pebble, or something similar gets stuck in their foot, they should not remove it or clean it. Instead, they should continue walking according to the rules of the Eirya-Samiti. This is because the main purpose of taking the vow of non-attachment is to be prepared to endure all hardships without attachment to the body.

The Sutra then continues:

**"If a Muni who has taken the vow of non-attachment encounters a living being, a seed, or dust in their eye, they should not remove it or clean it. They should continue walking according to the rules of the Eirya-Samiti."**

**Word by Word Meaning:**

* **Masian:** Monthly (referring to the Muni who has taken the vow of non-attachment)
* **Bhikkhu-Padimam:** Muni who has taken the vow of non-attachment
* **Padivannassa:**  who has taken the vow of non-attachment
* **Jāv:** as long as
* **Acchesi:** in the eye
* **Paṇāṇi:** living beings
* **vā:** or
* **Bīyāṇi:** seeds
* **vā:** or
* **Rae:** dust
* **Pariyāvajjejjā:** enters
* **No:** not
* **Se:** they
* **Kappati:** is it appropriate
* **Nīharitte:** to remove
* **vā:** or
* **Visohitte:** to clean
* **vā:** or
* **Kappati:** is it appropriate
* **Se:** they
* **Ahāriyam:** according to the rules of the Eirya-Samiti
* **Riyatte:** to walk
* **Kappati:** is it appropriate

**Meaning:**

If a Muni who has taken the vow of non-attachment encounters a living being, a seed, or dust in their eye, they should not remove it or clean it. Instead, they should continue walking according to the rules of the Eirya-Samiti.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra explains that when a Muni who has taken the vow of non-attachment is walking according to the rules of the Eirya-Samiti, and something like a fly enters their eye, they should not remove it or clean it. They should continue walking according to the rules of the Eirya-Samiti.

## Seventh Chapter
## With Hindi Commentary

(Mosquito) etc. creatures, sesame etc. seeds or dust etc. any object enters, then that object should neither be removed from the eye nor should the eye be cleansed with water etc. The meaning is that the suffering caused by the falling of dust etc. should be endured, because the Muni-vritti (conduct of a monk) is established for the endurance of such sufferings. But if there is a fear of death of any creature, then it should be removed. In the sutra, 'Paanani' is not incorrect because it is neuter gender in Prakrit.

Now the sutrakar speaks about the situation:

**261**
**Maasiyam bhikku-padimam padivannassa jatheva suriye athamejja tattheva jalanshi va thalanshi va dugganshi va ninanshi va pavvayanshi va visamanshi va gaddae va dariye va kappati se tam ranin tattheva uwayanavitte na se kappati padam avi gamitte.**

**Kalpate sa kallye praduhprabhayaam rajanyaam yaavad jvalati prachinabhimukhasya va dakshinabhimukhasya va pratichinabhimukhasya va uttarabhimukhasya va yatheryamartum.**

**Word-by-word meaning:**
**Maasiyam** - monthly, **bhikku-padimam padivannassa** - monk-vow-taken, **jatheva** - wherever, **suriye** - sun, **athmejjja** - sets, **tattheva** - there itself, **jalanshi** - in water, **va** - or, **thalanshi** - on land, **va** - or, **dugganshi** - in a difficult place, **va** - or, **ninanshi** - in a low place, **va** - or, **pavvayanshi** - on a mountain, **va** - or, **visamanshi** - in a difficult place, **va** - or, **gaddae** - in a fort, **va** - or, **dariye** - in a cave, **va** - or, **kappati** - it is suitable, **se** - that, **tam** - that, **ranin** - night, **tattheva** - there itself, **uwayanavitte** - to stay, **na** - not, **se** - that, **kappati** - it is suitable, **padam** - step, **avi** - even, **gamitte** - to go.
**Kappati** - it is suitable, **se** - that, **kallan** - in the evening, **paupphabhae** - at the time of the rising of the moon, **rayanie** - in the night, **jaav** - as long as, **jalante** - it burns, **painabhimukhasssa** - facing east, **va** - or, **dahiinabhimukhasssa** - facing south, **va** - or, **padiinabhimukhasssa** - facing west, **va** - or, **uttarabhimukhasssa** - facing north, **va** - or, **aharayam** - to eat, **riyatte** - it is suitable.

**Translation:**
For a monthly monk-vow-taken, wherever the sun sets, whether in water, on land, in a difficult place, in a low place, on a mountain, in a difficult place, in a fort, in a cave, or in any other place, it is suitable for him to stay that night there itself, he is not suitable to even take a step. It is suitable for him to eat in the evening, at the time of the rising of the moon, in the night, as long as it burns, facing east, south, west, or north.

Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
There, in the same place, it is appropriate for the Uvayana Vitta to cross over (pass) the time. But it is not appropriate for him to move even a single foot. Yes, he should wait until the next day's dawn, when the night has passed, and the sun has risen with full light, and then he should go, facing east, or facing south, or facing west, or facing north, according to the Irya Samiti.
Seventh Dasha
Original Meaning - It is appropriate for a monthly Bhikshu, a Pratimā-Pratīpannā Sadhu, to stay where the sun sets, whether it be water, land, an inaccessible place, a low place, a mountain, a difficult place, a pit, or a cave, he should spend the whole night there. It is not appropriate to move even a single foot from there. After the night is over, it is appropriate to go in any direction, east, south, west, or north, after sunrise. This should also be done according to the Irya Samiti.
Commentary - The subject of shelters has already been discussed in a previous Sutra. This Sutra states that if a Pratimā-Pratīpannā Sadhu happens to be on the road when the sun sets before he finds a shelter, he should stay where the sun sets, whether it be water, land, forest, mountain, low or difficult place, or even a cave or pit, he should not move a single step from there.

In the morning, when the sun illuminates every place with its rays, he can go in any direction, east, west, north, or south, as he pleases. In the morning, he should go in the direction that he should meditate.
Or
Here, the question may arise that if someone happens to be in the water when the sun sets,

## Seventh Decad

**With Hindi Commentary**

How can a monk spend the entire night in water if it happens? The solution states that the word "water" here should be interpreted as a dry water body. It could be a place under the shade of a tree or a dry spot in the water itself. A monk who has taken the vow of non-violence should spend the night there. He can spend the night in such a place. However, the commentator has interpreted the word "water" as the "fourth watch of the day" because dew starts falling from that time. Therefore, the monk should stay wherever the fourth watch of the day arrives. The commentator has written this in the commentary:

**263**
"The sun sets at the beginning of the fourth watch of the day for them. Therefore, they consider the end of the third watch as sunset. This is the meaning. Similarly, "water" refers to the water body, not water itself. How do they go at that time? Because it is beneficial for them, it is said. Here, the word "water" does not refer to river water (water body) but the end of the third watch of the day is referred to by the word "water". This is the rule of time."

The meaning of this commentary has been explained above. But this meaning does not seem appropriate. Because in the sutra, "jalansī" is in the seventh case. Therefore, its meaning can only be "in water", "on water" or "water subject". Secondly, the text "chatuṭṭhīe porusīe paḍimā-paḍivannā vihārā ṇo karejjā" is not found anywhere. Therefore, it seems completely logical to stay where there is a dry water body, etc., under the shade of a tree. Because the special provision has been made for the non-violent to endure hardships. However, if the monk's vow (pledge) is to wander for only three watches, then the commentator's meaning can also be justified. Otherwise, this doubt naturally arises that if the fourth watch of the day is considered "water" due to dew, then why was the first watch of the day not considered? Dew also falls heavily in it. In this way, wandering should also be prohibited in the first watch of the day, but this cannot be, because it is clearly stated in the same sutra that wandering should be done as soon as the sun rises.

Here, the word "water" has been interpreted as a dry water body according to the "naigama" principle, and there are usually trees, etc., near water bodies. Therefore, the above meaning is completely justified. If the statement of this sutra is considered according to the "naigama" principle, then there is no...

Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
Seventh Dasha
There is no fault; because according to the 'Naigam' nay, there are three divisions of the past, future and present. For example, there was ghee in this pot, there will be ghee in this pot and a certain action is taking place. Therefore, it appears that the statement of this sutra is in accordance with the 'Naigam' nay.
The sutrakar says the same thing in the following sutra:
A monk who has taken the vow of a masika (monthly) vow, it is not appropriate for him to sleep or move on the earth without a companion. The Kevali would say, "This is a binding action." If he sleeps or moves, he should touch the ground with his hands. He should stay in his place as per the rules, and leave his place as per the rules. If a sound is heard, it is not appropriate for him to grasp it. It is appropriate for him to place the sound on the previously marked spot. He should come to the same shelter and stay in his place as per the rules.
Word by word meaning: Masika - monthly, Bhikkhu-Padimam - monk who has taken the vow of a masika (monthly) vow, Padivanassa - who has taken the vow, Anantarahitaaye - without a companion, Pudhaviye - on the earth, Niddaayitte va - to sleep, Payalaayitte va - to move, No kappati - it is not appropriate, Kevali booya - the Kevali would say, Aadaanameyam - this is a binding action, Se - he, Tattha - there, Niddaayamaane va - sleeping, Payalaayamaane va - moving, Hatthehi - with his hands, Bhoomi - the ground, Paramusejja - touch, Yathaavidhimeva - as per the rules, Thaane - in his place, Thaayitte - to stay, Nikkhamitte - to leave, Ucchaar-Paasavane - if a sound is heard, Uppattijja - if it arises, No se kappati - it is not appropriate, Uginhitte va - to grasp, Kappati se - it is appropriate for him, Puvva-Padilehie - previously marked, Thandile - spot, Ucchaar-Paasavane - sound, Parithavitte - to place, Tammeva - the same, Uvassayam - shelter, Aagamma - coming to, Yathaavidhi - as per the rules, Thaane - in his place, Thaavitte - to stay.

**With Hindi Commentary**

Due to being mindful, it will cause violence to the earth-body, therefore it is appropriate to stay in a place according to the *Ahavihi* method, or to leave from there. If there is a suspicion of *Uccar* (excrement) and *Pasavane* (urine) there, then it is not appropriate to hold it back, but it is appropriate to dispose of it in a previously designated *Thandile* (excrement disposal ground). Then, coming back to the same *Uvassayam* (shelter), one should stay there after performing *Kayotsarg* (bodily functions) according to the *Ahavihi* method.

**265**

**Original Meaning:** It is not appropriate for a *Pratima-Pratipanna* (a monk who has attained the stage of *Pratima*) to sleep or take a nap called *Prachala* on the earth while being mindful, because the *Kevali* (omniscient) Lord states that this is a cause of *Karma-Bandhan* (bondage of karma). He says that the monk, while sleeping or taking a nap called *Prachala* there, will inevitably touch the earth with his hands, and this will inevitably cause violence. Therefore, one should stay in a place that is free from any fault according to the proper method, or move to another place from there. If there is a suspicion of excrement or urination there, then it is appropriate for him to dispose of them in a previously designated place, and then come back to the same place and perform bodily functions.

**Commentary:** This sutra explains the places where a *Pratima-Pratipanna* (a monk who has attained the stage of *Pratima*) should sleep. It is completely inappropriate for him to sleep lying down, sitting, or standing on the earth while being mindful. Because the *Kevali* (omniscient) Lord says that doing so will inevitably lead to or cause the bondage of karma. When he sleeps or takes a nap called *Prachala* in such a place, his hands will inevitably touch the earth, and this will inevitably lead to the killing of living beings. Therefore, it is appropriate for him to perform bodily functions in a place that is free from any fault according to the proper method. If he has a suspicion of excrement or urine there, he should not hold it back, but should dispose of it in a *Thandile* (excrement disposal ground) that has been previously designated and determined. After that, he should come back to the shelter and perform bodily functions.

Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
Seventh Dasha

This Sutra prohibits performing the aforementioned actions only on earth. If someone asks whether one can perform these actions on water, etc., one should answer that just as these actions are prohibited on sentient earth, similarly, one should understand the same for the six bodies of water, etc.

The word "Aadanam" in the Sutra means "being the cause of karma-bandha." This meaning is also understood from the analysis of the word: "Aadiyate iti Aadanam karma, tad-dhetu-bhutaani ashrava-dvaarani va-aadan-kaaran-e karya-upachaarat-karma-bandha-hetu-tvaat-aadanam-etat-karma-aadanam-iti va doshaanaam aadanam ayatanam etat."

The Sutra-kar also states the same subject in the upcoming Sutra:

"Maasiyam nam bhikkhu-padimam padivanassa no kappati sasarakkena kaayena gahaavati-kula bhattaae va paanaae va nikkhamittae va pavisittae va. Ah pun evam jaanejjaa sasarakkha se attaae va jallattaae va malattaae va pankattaae va viddhatthe se kappati gahaavati-kula bhattaae va paanaae va nikkhamittae va pavisittae va."

"Maasiki nu bhikkhu-pratima pratipanna(sy) no kalpate sarajaskena kaayena griha-pati-kula bhaktaay va paanaay va nishkraantu va praveshtu va. Ath punar evam jaaniyat sarajaskatvam tadataya (svedataya) va yallataya va malataya va pankataya va viddhvasta sa kalpate griha-pati-kula bhaktaay va paanaay va nishkraantu va praveshtu va."

Know this: If the **saccitta raj** (dust with consciousness) has been destroyed by **prasveda** (sweat), **jalatta** (water), **malatta** (excrement), **pankatta** (mud), or **viddhatthe** (destruction) due to **hast-sangarsha** (friction of hands), then it is **kappati** (proper) for him to **nikkhमित्तए** (exit) or **pavisittए** (enter) the **gahavatti** (householder)'s **kulan** (house) for **bhattaए** (food) or **paणाए** (water). **N** is in the sense of **vakyalakङar** (grammatical structure).

**Original Meaning:** It is not proper for a **masiki** (monthly) **bhiksu** (monk) who has received **pratima** (image) and is **anagar** (without a home) to exit or enter the householder's house for food or water with a body stained by **saccitta raj**. If he knows that the **saccitta raj** has been destroyed by sweat, bodily excrement, hand-excrement, or excrement produced by sweat, then it is proper for him to exit or enter the householder's house for food or water. Otherwise, it is not.

**Commentary:** This sutra states that a **masiki** (monthly) **bhiksu** (monk) who has received **pratima** (image) and is **anagar** (without a home) should never exit or enter the householder's house for food or water with a body stained by **saccitta raj**. However, if he knows that the **saccitta raj** on his body has been destroyed by sweat, bodily excrement, hand-excrement, or excrement produced by sweat, then the monk can go to the householder's house for food or water.

The essence of this sutra is that if the body is stained by **saccitta raj** for any reason, then it is not proper for the monk to leave his **upaashraya** (shelter) and enter the householder's house for alms. Similarly, if the body is wet with **saccitta jal** (water with consciousness), then it is also completely improper to go for alms.

If someone doubts how the body can be stained by **saccitta raj**, then the solution is to say that sometimes, while going to the forest, the monk's body can be stained by **saccitta raj** coming from the earth, and there can be many other reasons like this. **Saccitta raj** often flies in the **mahavaayu** (great wind) and sticks to the body. **Mahavaayu** often blows more in the summer season, which is why the sutra mentions **prasveda** (sweat) etc.

Now the Sutrakar speaks about purity:
Dasaśrutaskandha Sutra
A Māsika Bhikkhu who has taken the Pratimā vow should not wash his hands, feet, teeth, eyes, or mouth with cold or hot water that is devoid of life, either once or repeatedly. Nor should he wash them with a paste or with food.

Commentary:
Māsika - a Māsika Bhikkhu, a monk who has taken the Pratimā vow
Bhikkhu-Pratimā - the Pratimā vow taken by a monk
Pratipanna - one who has taken the vow
Śītoda-viyaḍeṇa - with cold water devoid of life
Uṣṇoda-viyaḍeṇa - with hot water devoid of life
Haththāṇi - hands
Pādāṇi - feet
Dantāṇi - teeth
Akṣiṇi - eyes
Muhaṃ - mouth
Ucccholittae - to wash once
Padhoittae - to wash repeatedly
Naṇṇattha - but
Levālevena - with a paste
Bhatta-māseṇa - with food

Meaning:
A Māsika Bhikkhu who has taken the Pratimā vow should not wash his hands, feet, teeth, eyes, or mouth with cold or hot water that is devoid of life, either once or repeatedly. However, if his body is soiled with impurities or food, he may wash it with water.

Page #337:
---------------------------
## Seventh Chapter
## With Hindi Commentary

**266**

**Commentary:** In this sutra, keeping in mind the protection of water-bodied beings, the sutrakar speaks about the use of water for purification. It is not appropriate for a monk who has renounced the world to wash his hands, feet, teeth, eyes, or mouth with cold or hot water that is free of life, for the purpose of beautification or for the sake of bodily comfort, either once or repeatedly. However, if an impure substance has come into contact with the body, he can purify it, meaning he can cleanse himself with water after defecation, urination, etc. Similarly, he can wash his mouth and hands after eating. These actions are not prohibited. In addition to this, he should never use water for "ucchelana" (meaningless washing of the body). The meaning is that water should be used for purification only after defecation and eating, and not at other times.

The words "sheetodak-vikat" and "ushnodak-vikat" appear in the sutra. Their meaning is as follows: "Sheetacca tadudakamiti sheetodakam tacca vikatam vigatajeevamiti sheetodakvikatam. Evamushnodakvikatam api." Meaning, lifeless cold water is called "sheetodak-vikat" and lifeless hot water is called "ushnodak-vikat." In the sutra, the word "hast" is in the neuter gender and plural form in Prakrit, which is not a fault.

The sutrakar does not mean by "levalevena" that all types of applications should be purified with water, but rather it is a provision for removing specific impure substances. For example, if a bird drops excrement while walking on the road, then it should be purified with water, because if the body is contaminated with excrement, then activities like study, etc., will not be peaceful. Therefore, such substances should be removed. However, it is completely inappropriate to use water to remove every ordinary application. The essence of the entire statement is that water contact is necessary only to remove a specific type of dirt, not everywhere.

Now the sutrakar speaks about the act of walking:

"Masiyam nam bhikkhu-padim padivannasass no kappati asass va hatthiss va gonass va mahisass va kolasunagass va sunass va vaggass va dutthass va avadamanass payam avi..."

One should never frighten animals. It is possible that they may be frightened and deviate from their path, and going into a terrifying forest, they may fall into the clutches of a lion or other ferocious animal. Then, the cause of their violence will be that very fright. Therefore, one should never frighten gentle animals; nor should one deviate from the right path out of fear of the wicked.

Now, the Sutrakar speaks about firm resolve or posture:

**"A monk who has taken the vow of non-violence should not move from the shade because it is cold, nor should he move to the shade because it is hot. He should endure whatever is there at that time."**

**Word by Word Meaning:**

* **Masian:** A monk who has taken the vow of non-violence
* **Bhikkhu-padim padivannassa:** A monk who has taken the vow of non-violence
* **Chhayao:** From the shade
* **Siyamti:** It is cold
* **Unham:** To a hot place
* **Iyattae:** To go
* **Unhao:** From a hot place
* **Unhamti:** It is hot
* **Chhayam:** To the shade
* **Iyattae:** To go
* **No kappati:** It is not appropriate
* **Jam jath jaya sia:** Wherever he may be at that time
* **Tam tatha taya ahiasae:** He should endure the cold or heat

**Meaning:**

A monk who has taken the vow of non-violence should not leave a cold place because of the cold, nor should he leave a hot place because of the heat. But he should endure the cold or heat wherever he may be at that time.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra, like the previous one, speaks about self-strength. When a monk who has taken the vow of non-violence is sitting in a cold place during the winter, he should not go to a warm place to avoid the cold. Similarly, in the summer, it is not appropriate to leave a hot place and go to the shade. A monk should remain seated in the place where he is at that time, with his own dignity. The mind's...

It is not appropriate to change one's location due to being swayed by fickleness. One should patiently endure both cold and heat. By doing so, the firmness of the Sadhu's self-strength is proven. The firmness of the mind and posture can accomplish every task. Everyone should learn from this statement that the firmness of the mind and posture is essential for the accomplishment of every task.

Now, the Sutrakar concludes the first image, saying:

**"Evam khalu masiyam bhikku-padim ahasuttam, ahakappam, ahamaggam, ahataccam, sammam karana phasitta, palitta, sohitta, tiritta, kittaitta, arahitta, anaae anupaliya bhavaai."** (1)

**"Evam khalu masiki bhikku-pratima yathasutram, yathakalpam, yathamargam, yathatatvam, samyak kayena sprushtva, palitva, shodhita, tirthya, kirtayitva, araadhya, aagnyaanupalayita bhavati."**

**Word by Word Meaning:**

* Evam - Thus
* Khalu - Emphatic particle
* Masian - Monthly
* Bhikku-padim - Bhikkhu-pratima (image of a monk)
* Ahasuttam - According to the sutra
* Ahakappam - According to the kalpa (conduct)
* Ahamaggam - According to the path
* Ahataccam - According to the truth
* Sammam - With samya (equality)
* Kaayena - By the body
* Phasitta - Touched
* Palitta - Protected
* Sohitta - Purified from transgressions
* Tiritta - Completed
* Kittaitta - Celebrated
* Arahitta - Worshipped
* Anaae - By the command
* Anupaliya - Continuously followed
* Bhavati - Becomes

**Meaning:**

Thus, the monthly image of the monk, according to the sutra, according to the conduct, according to the path, according to the truth, is touched, protected, purified from transgressions, completed, celebrated, worshipped, and continuously followed by the command.

**Commentary:**

This sutra concludes the first image. The Sutrakar says that the first monthly image is described in the sutras, its conduct is described, its path is described, i.e., the path of knowledge, etc., to liberation is described.

## The Seventh Dasha

**With Hindi Commentary**

**273**

Just as its essence is, or as it truly is, in the same way, by touching the body, by nurturing it usefully, by purifying it from transgressions, by fulfilling it with fame, by the command of the Lord, it is worshipped or nurtured by the soul. Every Muni who has attained the image should follow this practice. The Muni who follows this practice in a regulated and methodical way will surely succeed.

**Now the Sutrakar describes the second image to the seventh image in the following Sutra:**

**2. ** A two-month *bhikkhu-padima* who has attained the image, and who has a constantly shed body, should take only two *datti* of food and two *datti* of water.  The words "cha" and "eva" indicate a definitive meaning.

**3. ** A three-month *bhikkhu-padima* should take three *datti*.

**4. ** A four-month *bhikkhu-padima* should take four *datti*.

**5. ** A five-month *bhikkhu-padima* should take five *datti*.

**6. ** A six-month *bhikkhu-padima* should take six *datti*.

**7. ** A seven-month *bhikkhu-padima* should take seven *datti*.

**As many months as there are, so many *datti* should be taken.**

**Word Meaning:**

* **Domaasiyam:** Two-month
* **Bhikkhu-padima:** *Bhikkhu-padima*
* **Padivannassa:** One who has attained the image
* **Niccam:** Always
* **Vosatthakaaye:** One with a shed body
* **Jāv:** Until
* **Do dattiyo:** Two *datti*

Similarly, in a three-month *bhikkhu-padima*, there are three *datti*. In a four-month *bhikkhu-padima*, there are four *datti*. In a five-month *bhikkhu-padima*, there are five *datti*. In a six-month *bhikkhu-padima*, there are six *datti*. In a seven-month *bhikkhu-padima*, there are seven *datti*. As many monthly images as there are, so many *datti* should be taken.

##  274
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

**Original Meaning:** A Bi-monthly Bhikshu Pratimā, having attained the state of an Anāgāra, is eternally liberated from the body, meaning he has no attachment to the body and only takes two dattis of food and two dattis of water. Similarly, in the Tri-monthly, Chatur-monthly, Pancha-monthly, Shan-monthly, and Sapta-monthly Bhikshu Pratimās, the Muni can take three, four, five, six, and seven dattis respectively. In essence, the number of dattis should increase with the number of months in the Pratimā.

**Commentary:** This Sutra describes the second to seventh Pratimās. When a Sadhu takes the second Bhikshu Pratimā, he should take two dattis of food and two dattis of water. However, his other practices should remain the same as the first Pratimā. The only difference is in the number of dattis. This should be understood for all seven Pratimās. Meaning, in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh Pratimās, he should take three, four, five, six, and seven dattis of food and water respectively. The intention is that the number of dattis should be equal to the number of months in the Pratimā. Each Pratimā is for two months. The number of months is only mentioned due to the increase in the number of dattis. In essence, the duration of the Bi-monthly Pratimā is also one month. The same should be understood for the Tri-monthly and others. The difference is only in the number of dattis. Thus, this Sutra describes seven dattis.

Now, the Sutrakar describes the eighth Pratimā:

**A Padmā Sapta-Raindīya Bhikshu Pratimā, having attained the state of an Anāgāra, is eternally liberated from the body, as long as he lives. He should stay in a place that is suitable for the fourth meal, either in his own house, or in a village, or in a place where there are many people, or in a place that is high, or in a place that is near a river, or in a place that is near a forest. There, he may experience divine, human, animal, or hellish states. He may experience these states...**

If he walks or stands, he should not walk or stand. There, if a sound or a voice arises, he should not hear the sound or the voice. He should place the sound or the voice on the previously written ground, and he should stay in the same place. Thus, this first seven-night-day monk-image should be followed as long as the order is followed. ||8||

**Commentary:**

The first seven-night-day monk-image is for the one who has renounced the world and whose body is always free from attachment. He should follow all the rules that have been previously stated. He should endure all hardships. But he should not perform the fourth vow of non-violence by abstaining from water, and he should not stay outside the village or in the capital city, lying on his back, on his side, or sitting in a meditative posture. If there are divine beings, human beings, or animals who come to him, he should not move or fall. There, if a sound or a voice arises, he should not hear the sound or the voice. He should place the sound or the voice on the previously written ground, and he should stay in the same place.

If a disturbance arises related to the divine, human, or animal realms, and it causes one to deviate from their meditation or fall from their posture, it is not appropriate to deviate or fall. However, if there is a concern about excreting waste, it is not appropriate to hold it back. Instead, one should find a suitable place beforehand and relieve themselves there. Then, they should return to their posture and continue their practice as before. In this way, the first seven nights and days of the Bhikkhu-Padima, as prescribed by the Sutras, are followed according to the Lord's instructions.

**Original Meaning:** The first seven nights and days of the Bhikkhu-Padima, a practitioner who has renounced worldly life, does not experience attachment to the body and endures all trials. It is appropriate for them to perform Kayotsarg and other practices in the fourth state, without water, outside the village or city, on an Uttana (lying down) posture, a side posture, or a sitting posture. If a disturbance arises related to the divine, human, or animal realms, and it causes them to deviate from their meditation or fall from their posture, it is not appropriate to deviate or fall. If there is a concern about excreting waste, they should not hold it back. Instead, they should find a suitable place beforehand and relieve themselves there. Then, they should return to their posture and continue their practices as before. In this way, the first seven nights and days of the Padima, as prescribed by the Sutras, are followed according to the Lord's instructions.

## Seventh Decad

**With Hindi Commentary**

**2776**

**Commentary:** This sutra describes the eighth pratima. The bhikshu must follow the same procedures as in the first seven pratima. He must observe the pratima for seven nights and days. However, he must also fast for seven days, meaning he should perform the "chavivihar ekanatar tapa" (alternate practice of four types of austerities). He should go outside the city or capital and spend his time meditating in the uttanasana (facing the sky), parvasana (lying on one side), or nishdyasana (sitting with legs crossed) postures. If any deity, human, or animal tries to distract him, he should not be disturbed from his meditation. If he feels the need to relieve himself, he should not hold it back but should go to a previously designated place and relieve himself. After that, he should return to his meditation. This is called the "first seven days of the bhikshu pratima." It is performed according to the previous sutras.

Now the question arises: why is this pratima called the "first" when it should be the "eighth" in the sequence? The answer is that the first seven pratima are numbered according to the number of dattis, but this pratima does not have any dattis, so it is called the "first." Similarly, the ninth is called the "second" and the tenth is called the "third." Due to the special nature of the abhigraha, the names are also special. However, remember that the rules of the first seven pratima, apart from the dattis, must also be followed in these.

Now the sutrakar speaks about the ninth and tenth pratima:

**6.** "Thus, for seven nights and days, if he finds a place for the navara, either in a place where there is a stick, or a place where there is a log, or a place where there is a tree, he should remain there and observe it until the end."

**10.** "Thus, for seven nights and days, if he finds a place for the navara, either in a place where there is a cow's milk, or a place where there is a hero's seat, or a place where there is a mango tree, he should remain there and observe it until the end."

## The Seventh Chapter

**With Hindi Commentary**

**276**

**Commentary:** This sutra describes the second (ninth) and third (tenth) images. The second image is also observed for seven nights and seven days with the sixth penance, meaning it is observed with two fasts each. Like the first image, this one also involves spending time outside the city, performing prostrations, sitting in a long posture, or with the head and feet on the ground and the rest of the body raised, or in the utkutukasana posture, sitting with the feet flat on the ground. The main purpose of the second image is to achieve self-realization through meditation in these postures. This is how this image is worshipped.

The third image, also lasting seven days and seven nights, follows all the rules of the first image. Additionally, this image is worshipped with the eighth penance, the oil penance, but the penance is observed without water. In this image, one is instructed to perform kayotsarga, etc., in the godohanikasana, virasana, and amra-kubjasana postures.

If anyone is curious about the meaning of godohanikasana, virasana, and amra-kubjasana, it is explained as follows: "Godohanikasana - godohanikriyayav godohanika, godohanpravrittasyaiva agrapadatalaabhyam avasthanam kriyate ity arthah, tayavastayin iti bhavah." This means that just as one sits with the soles of the feet raised to milk a cow, similarly, sitting in that posture for meditation is called 'godohanikasana'. Virasana - "viraanam drudha-sanhananaanam, asanam avasthanam yatha bhavathi tatha. Simhasanaadhirudhasya simhasanaapanayaneyapyavichalaroopena bhumavavasthanam iti bhavah." This means that if a person is sitting on a chair and another person comes and removes the chair from under them, and the person sitting remains on the ground in the same unwavering posture, that is called 'virasana'. Amra-kubjasana - "amra-phalavad vakraakaraa sthitih amra-kubja-sanamuchyate." This means that sitting in a curved posture like an amra fruit is called amra-kubjasana.

Achieving a meditative state through these three postures is called the third bhikshu-pratima. According to the sutras, one should worship this image and achieve self-development.

Now the Sutrakar describes the subject of the eleventh pratima in sequence:
Thus, in a day and night also.  With the sixth fast, without water, going outside the village or as far as the capital, one should hold both feet together and extend the arms.  The rest is the same as before, as long as it is observed.  || 11 ||
  
  Word by word meaning: Thus - in this way, Aho-ra-ind-iya-vi - in a day and night also, one should know about the pratima, but, Nav-ram - this is the special thing, Chat-te-nam - with the sixth, Bhat-te-nam - fast, Apa-na-e-nam - without water, Ga-mas-sa - of the village, Va - or, Ja-v - as far as, Ra-ya-ha-ni-ssa - the capital, Va - or, Ba-hi-ya - outside, I-sim - a little, Sa - both, Do-vi Pa-e - feet, Sa-ha-tu - contracted, and, Vag-gha-ri-ya - Pa-ni-ssa - both arms, long, that is, extending the arms to the knees, Tha-nam - posture, Tha-i-tta-e - should be done, Se-sam - the rest, Tam - that, Che-va - also, Ja-v - as long as, Anu-pa-li-tta - observing this pratima, Bha-vai - happens.    
  Original meaning: Thus, one should also know about the pratima of a night and day.  The special thing about this is that it is done with the sixth fast, and the fast is without water.  Going outside the village or the capital, one should contract both feet a little and extend the arms to the knees, and do the posture.  The rest of the description is the same as before.  Thus, this pratima is observed with all the rules that have been stated.
  Commentary: In this Sutra, the subject of the eleventh pratima is described.  This pratima is of eight praharas.  Its method is that it is done without water, with two fasts, going outside the city, etc., and contracting both feet a little, and with the Jin-mudra,

Page #349:
---------------------------
## Seventh Decad
**With Hindi Commentary**

281
Both arms should be extended to the knees and the body should be relaxed. Remember that the focus of the mind should be the same as in the Jin-mudra. While enduring all kinds of obstacles, one should worship the presented image.

In these images, the special rules of Hatha Yoga are given. But the special description of meditation should be seen in Jain Yoga-shastra. Performing these actions, what siddhi can a muni not attain? Rather, he can attain all kinds of siddhis effortlessly, no siddhi is impossible for him.

At this point, the question may arise that while the description of asana and kayotsarga has been given, why has the sutrakar not described meditation? In response, it is said that just as the description of the beginning and end is considered to include the description of the middle, similarly, the description of asana and kayotsarga should be understood to include the description of meditation, because the main purpose of meditation is to be absorbed in the object of meditation. The method of being absorbed in the object of meditation should be known from other scriptures.

Now the sutrakar speaks of the subject of the twelfth image in the sequence:

**A single monk, having renounced the world, should always remain with a relaxed body, until he dies. He should eat only one meal a day, without any possessions, and should go out to the village or wherever he wants, with a relaxed body, with a single-minded vision, with unblinking eyes, with unattached steps, with all senses subdued, with two feet together, with hands placed in the position of a lion, and should remain there until he dies. He should not utter any sounds or words there. He should remain there with the sounds and words of the previous life suppressed. He should remain in the same place.**

A naked ascetic who has taken the vow of a one-night mendicant (bhiksu-pratima) should always be free from attachment to the body (vyutsrusht-kaya). As long as he can endure, he should, with the eighth part of his food (ashtame bhakte), without water (apanake), outside the village (bahigramasya) or even outside the capital (yavad rajadhaniya), with a slightly bent body (ishta-pragbhar-gatena kayena), with a single-pointed vision (ek-pudgalasthitaya drishtya), with unblinking eyes (animish-nayanabhyam), with limbs in their proper position (yatha-pranihitairagairaih), with all senses subdued (sarvendriyairagptai), with both feet drawn in (dvaavapi padau sanhritya), with outstretched arms (pralambita-paneh), stand in a place (sthanam sthatum). There, he will endure divine, human, and animal afflictions (divyam manushyam tiryagyo-nikamcha [upasarga]). If he experiences the urge to urinate or defecate (uchchar-prasravanam utpadyet), he should not hold it back (na sa kalpata uchchar-prasravanavagrahitum). He should, however, be able to release it (kalpate sa purva-pratilikhite sthandhile uchchar-prasravane parishthapitum) on the previously designated spot (purva-pratilikhite sthandhile). He should stand in the proper posture (yathavidhye eva sthanam sthatum).

**Meaning:**

A naked ascetic who has taken the vow of a one-night mendicant should always be free from attachment to the body. He should endure all afflictions, both divine, human, and animal. He should stand outside the village or even outside the capital, with a slightly bent body, a single-pointed vision, unblinking eyes, limbs in their proper position, and all senses subdued. He should keep both feet drawn in and his arms outstretched. If he experiences the urge to urinate or defecate, he should not hold it back, but should release it on the previously designated spot. He should then cleanse himself and stand in the proper posture.

## Seventh Decad
**With Hindi Commentary**

**Verse:**

The one who observes the eighth vow, should go outside the village or capital, slightly bend the body forward, fix the gaze on a single point, with unwavering eyes, still limbs, all senses concealed, legs contracted, arms extended, and engage in *kayotsarga* (meditation). They should endure all obstacles that arise from the realms of gods, humans, and animals. If they experience the urge to defecate or urinate, they should not restrain it, but instead, relieve themselves at a previously designated spot, return to their seat, and resume the *kayotsarga* and other practices.

**Commentary:**

This verse describes the twelfth *pratima* (meditation posture). This *pratima* lasts for only one night. The monk observing this *pratima* should renounce all attachments to the body and endure all trials. They should then go outside the city or capital, fix their gaze on a single point, slightly bend their body, contract their legs, extend their arms to the knees, and engage in *kayotsarga* (meditation). They should endure all obstacles that arise from the realms of gods, humans, or animals. If they experience the urge to defecate or urinate, it is not appropriate to restrain it. They should relieve themselves at a previously designated spot, return to their seat, and resume the *kayotsarga* and other practices with a focused mind. Restraining the urge to defecate or urinate can lead to various illnesses. The monk should be enthusiastic while observing the *pratima*, as only an enthusiastic individual can succeed in this practice.

The author's intention in mentioning fixing the gaze on a single point is to focus the gaze on the desired point, such as the tip of the nose or the toenails, while withdrawing the gaze from all other directions. This will restrain external vision and allow the internal vision to be absorbed in the object of meditation. This will lead to the meditator and the meditation merging into their essence.

## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Seventh Dasha

The meditator will become one with the object of meditation and attain complete samadhi. This is because as long as there is a sense of separation between the meditator, meditation, and the object of meditation, there will be no single-pointedness and therefore no samadhi. Just as in the case of a student, teacher, and study, the student becomes one with the teacher and the study, absorbing all knowledge from the teacher, similarly, one should understand the relationship between the meditator, the object of meditation, and meditation. The soul, when in samadhi, loses the sense of separation between the meditator, the object of meditation, and meditation, and becomes one with the object of meditation. A muni should attain samadhi through padhastha, pindhastha, rupastha, and rupaatita meditation.

The following sutra explains the consequences of not properly observing the twelfth pratima:

**"A monk who does not properly observe the one-night bhikshu pratima will face these three consequences: it will be detrimental to his well-being, it will lead to misfortune, it will make him incapable of forgiveness, it will lead to unwholesome actions, and it will prevent him from attaining the happiness of the future. For example, he may become insane, he may suffer from a long-term illness, or he may deviate from the path of enlightenment."**

**Word by word meaning:**

* **Eg-raiyan:** one night
* **Bhikkhu-padim:** bhikshu pratima
* **Ananupalemanas:** not properly observing
* **Anngaaras:** monk
* **Ime:** these
* **Tao:** three
* **Thana:** places
* **Ahiyaa:** detrimental to well-being
* **AsuBhaae:** misfortune
* **Akkamaae:** incapable of forgiveness
* **Anisesaae:** unwholesome actions
* **Ananugamiyattaae:** not attaining the happiness of the future
* **Bhavanti:** will be
* **Tam jaha:** for example
* **Ummaayam va labhejjha:** become insane
* **Dihkalaiyam va rogaayankam va paaunejja:** suffer from a long-term illness
* **Kevali-pannattao dhammaao bhansjja:** deviate from the path of enlightenment

## Seventh Decad

**With Hindi Commentary**

**Long-term:**  A long-term illness may be acquired, and one may become corrupted by the Dharma spoken by the Kevalis.

**Original Meaning:** For an unclothed one who does not properly observe the Bhiksu-Pratima for one night, these three places are for harm, for ill-omen, for forgiveness, for liberation, and for future suffering. For example, one may acquire madness, acquire a long-term illness, and become corrupted by the Dharma spoken by the Kevalis.

**Commentary:** This Sutra states that if a Bhiksu does not properly observe the twelfth Bhiksu-Pratima, then the three places mentioned are for harm, ill-omen, forgiveness, liberation, and suffering in the future. Due to favorable or unfavorable circumstances, one may acquire madness or a long-term illness, or one may become corrupted by the Dharma taught by the Kevalis. A Bhiksu who becomes corrupted by his vows also becomes corrupted by the Dharma in the form of scripture or conduct. Therefore, not properly observing the Pratima inevitably leads to the acquisition of the three aforementioned faults.

The words "Tao" and "Thana" are neuter gender, but they are used in the masculine gender. However, due to their Prakrit nature, there is no fault in this.

**Now the Sutra-maker describes the benefits of properly observing this Pratima:**

For an unclothed one who properly observes the Bhiksu-Pratima for one night, these three places are for happiness, for good omen, for forgiveness, for liberation, and for future happiness. For example, one may acquire Omniscience, one may acquire Manaprajna-Jnana, or one may acquire Kevala-Jnana before it is due. Thus, this one-night Bhiksu-Pratima is for happiness, for good omen, for forgiveness, for liberation, and for future happiness.

This one-night Bhikshu-Pratima is properly touched, protected, purified, completed, praised, worshipped, and continuously observed with knowledge.

## Seventh Dasha

**With Hindi Commentary**

**287**

They have been taken. For example, he obtains knowledge of the duration of time (avadhi-jnana) or knowledge of the mind (manah-paryav-jnana) or knowledge of the unmanifested (kevala-jnana) which was not present before. In this way, this one-night monk-image, as stated in the scriptures, is truly observed, nurtured, purified, perfected, celebrated, and worshipped by the body according to its conduct and path of knowledge, etc., and is continuously followed by the command of the Lord.

**Commentary:** This sutra states that the monk who properly worships this twelfth image obtains three invaluable things. He certainly obtains one of these three qualities: knowledge of the duration of time, knowledge of the mind, and knowledge of the unmanifested, because in this image he destroys the great group of karmas. Therefore, this image is for benefit, for good karma, for power, for liberation, or for obtaining knowledge, etc., that will accompany him in the future. The purpose of this image is to obtain these or the aforementioned three types of knowledge. _This one-night monk-image is truly as stated in the scriptures, according to its conduct and path of knowledge, etc., and is endowed with whatever its destructive and pacifying aspects are. It should be properly observed by the body, nurtured for use, purified from transgressions, perfected until the duration of time, and celebrated and worshipped by the scriptures on the days of fasting, etc., following the command of the Lord. Because through this image, the soul certainly achieves the desired result. This statement has fully established Hatha Yoga or Raja Yoga._

Now the sutra-maker concludes the present study by saying:

"Thus, these twelve monk-images have been established by the Lord for the monks."

**Thus ends the Seventh Dasha named "Monk-Image."**

Word Meaning - These, indeed, are those - they were by the Theras - venerable Bhagavants, by the Bhagavants, twelve - twelve Bhiksu-Pratimas - Bhiksu-Pratimas declared - declared, thus I say. Thus - in this way, Bhiksu-Pratimas - Bhiksu-Pratimas named - named, the seventh - seventh Dasha - Dasha is complete - complete.

Commentary - Concluding the study presented in this Sutra, the Sutrakar says that these twelve Bhiksu-Pratimas were declared by the venerable Bhagavants, thus I say.
Although these Pratimas are ordained in the Anga Sutras, they are all Arhan-spoken, yet this statement is made to prove the venerable Bhagavants as speakers like 'Jin'. The venerable ones are those who follow the principles spoken by 'Jin'.

Shri Sudharma Swami Ji says to Shri Jambu Swami Ji - "O disciple! Just as I heard the meaning of this Dasha from the mouth of Shri Shraman Bhagavan Mahavira Swami Ji, in the same way I have told you, but I have not said anything from my own intellect."

Page #357:
---------------------------
## The Eighth Dasha

The seventh Dasha describes the twelve images of the monk. After completing the images, the Muni must search for a suitable place to reside during the rainy season. Having found a suitable place, they must spend the entire rainy season there. This Dasha will discuss this, hence it is named 'Paryushana Kalpa'. As it becomes a fixed place of residence for four months, the name 'Paryushana' (paritaḥ-samasatyena uṣaṇā-vāsaḥ) is also meaningful.

When the Chaturmas-nivas begins at a place, after one month and twenty nights, a 'Samvatsari Parva' arrives. In that Samvatsari Parva, eight days are considered as 'Paryushana'. According to the current practice, during those days, the holy life stories of Shri Shraman Bhagwan Mahavir Swami or other Tirthankaras are studied. This Dasha describes the birth and other auspicious events of Shri Shraman Bhagwan Mahavir Swami, mentioning the Nakshatras in which they occurred. Here, only the information about the Nakshatra in which each auspicious event occurred is given. Its detailed description should be known from other scriptures. Listeners and readers should definitely learn from the auspicious events of Shri Bhagwan.

Now, the Sutrakar states the initial Sutra of this Dasha:

"Teṇam kāleṇam teṇam samaeṇam samaṇe bhagavam mahāvīre pañca hatthuttara hotyā, tam jahā-hatthuttarahiṁ cue caittā gabbhaṁ vakkate." ||1||

-

Page #358:
---------------------------
The English translation preserving the Jain terms is as follows:

In that time, in that period, the Shraman Bhagavan Mahavira had five Hastouttara (auspicious events). That is to say:

1. Hastouttara, having fallen from the celestial abode, entered the womb.
2. Hastouttara, emerged from the womb.
3. Hastouttara, was born.
4. Hastouttara, having become a monk, renounced the household life and adopted the ascetic life.
5. Hastouttara, attained the infinite, unexcelled, unobstructed, complete, perfect, omniscient-vision-knowledge.

When the Bhagavan attained Nirvana under the Svati nakshattra, he again preached, as I say.

Thus ends the eighth stage called Paryushana.

## The Eighth Dasha (Period)

**Commentary in Hindi included.**

**2617**

**Upadanseti** - It has been shown. **Tti bemi** - Thus I say. **Iti** - Thus, the **Paryushana** named **Ashtami** (eighth) **dasha** (period) is complete.

**Original Meaning** - In that time and at that time, the **Shraman Bhagwan Mahavir Swami**'s five **kalyanak** (auspicious events) occurred in the **Uttara Phalguni** constellation. Like - in **Uttara Phalguni**, he was born from the womb after being expelled from the **dev-lok** (heavenly realm), in **Uttara Phalguni**, he was transferred from one womb to another, in **Uttara Phalguni**, he was born, in **Uttara Phalguni**, he was tonsured and took **anagari** (renunciation) from home, and in **Uttara Phalguni**, he attained **anant** (infinite), **pradhan** (primary), **nirvyaghat** (unobstructed), **niravaran** (unhindered), **kritsna** (complete), **pratipoorna** (fully fulfilled), **keval-gyan** (perfect knowledge) and **keval-darshan** (perfect vision). **Bhagwan** attained **moksha** (liberation) in the **Swati** constellation. This has been taught again. Thus I say. The eighth **dasha** named **Paryushana** is complete.

**Commentary** - The eighth **dasha** describes the **Paryushana** period because when eight months of wandering are completed, the **muni** (ascetic) has to stay in a village or city to spend the rainy season. Here, the mention of the constellations of the five **kalyanak** of **Shree Bhagwan Mahavir Swami** is a symbolic indication of this. During this time, one should fully complete their actions. Therefore, this **dasha** is called '**Paryushana Kalp**'. During this time, one should definitely study the **Jin** (Jina) character, etc.

Generally, this sutra (text) only states that at the end of the fourth **araka** (period) of the **avsarpin** (descending) time and in the **nirvibhajya** (indivisible) time, the five **kalyanak** of **Shree Shraman Bhagwan Mahavir Swami** occurred in the **Uttara Phalguni** constellation. Now the question arises, what is the actual meaning of the word '**Bhagvat**'? In response, it is said that the word '**Bhag**' has fourteen meanings, twelve of which are proven by the addition of the suffix '**matup**', and the remaining two meanings do not apply to **Shree Bhagwan**. Those meanings are: **arka** (sun), **gyan** (knowledge), **mahaatmya** (greatness), **yash** (fame), **vairagya** (dispassion), **mukti** (liberation), **roop** (form), **veerya** (strength), **prayatna** (effort), **ichchha** (desire), **shree** (prosperity), **dharma** (righteousness), **aishwarya** (wealth) and **yoni** (birth). Of these fourteen, excluding **arka** and **yoni**, all other qualities...

Page #360:
---------------------------
## 262
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Eighth Dasha

He is indeed a **Jina**. But if the comparison is made with the sun (Arka), then it can also be an epithet of the **Jina**. The suffix 'matup' does not occur from this.

Some people consider six **Kalyanak** of **Sri Bhagwan Mahavir Swami**. They say that the **garbha sanharan** of the **Jina** also happened in the Uttara Phalguni Nakshatra. Therefore, this is also a **Kalyanak**. But their statement is not logical, because if this is accepted, then **Sri Rishabhdev Bhagwan** will also have six **Kalyanak**, as is evident from the sutra "Panch Uttara Sadhe Abhi I Chhate Hottha". Just as the coronation was accepted due to the similarity of the Nakshatra, in the same way, the **garbha sanharan** has also been accepted here due to the similarity of the Nakshatra. Therefore, just as **Sri Rishabhdev Bhagwan** does not have six **Kalyanak**, in the same way, **Sri Shraman Bhagwan Mahavir Swami** cannot have six **Kalyanak**. Secondly, what is seen in the world with wonder due to the influence of low-caste karma, how can it be considered as **Kalyanak**? And what the scholars consider as wonder, if the people also see it with wonder, then what is the wonder in it? Therefore, it is not right to be too enthusiastic about this statement. Therefore, it is proved that it is logical to consider only five **Kalyanak** of **Sri Bhagwan**. For example:

(1) Entering the womb on Ashadh Shukla Shashthi
(2) Birth on Chaitra Shukla Trayodashi
(3) Acceptance of **Pravrajya**
(4) **Keval Jnana** on Margashirsha Krishna Dashami
(5) **Moksha** on Kartiki Amavasya

In this sutra, the sutra-karta has briefly described the entire life journey of **Sri Bhagwan Mahavir Swami**. For example:

(1) From entering the womb, one should know about all the **garbha dhan** and other rituals.
(2) From birth, one should know the entire subject of the glory of birth.
(3) From **diksha**, one should know the entire life story till **diksha**.
(4) From **Keval Jnana**, one should know about the attainment of **Keval Jnana** after all the virtuous conduct and the proper **vihar charya** of **Sri Bhagwan**.
(5) From **nirvana**, one should know the entire conduct from **Keval Jnana** to the attainment of **nirvana pad**.

The meaning is that the entire life story of **Sri Shraman Bhagwan Mahavir Swami** has been described in the form of a sutra in these five **Kalyanak**.

Ashtami Dasha
With Hindi Commentary.
263
The 'Kalpasutra' was created with this same intention and based on this same chapter, and the fifteenth chapter of the 'Acharaanga' also describes this same topic. Shri Bhagwan remained in the state of Kevali for a little less than thirty years and attained Nirvana after living a full seventy-two years.
There is doubt here that on Ashadh Shukla Shashthi, there was entry into the womb, on Chaitra Shukla Trayodashi, birth, and on Kartiki Amavasya, Nirvana. From this, a seventy-two-year lifespan is not proven, so how can it be accepted that Shri Bhagwan's lifespan was only seventy-two years? In the solution to this, I have received a handwritten letter. It is written in a mixed language. In it, this topic is made completely clear. For the convenience and certainty of the readers, its replica (copy) is given here:
"Shri Bhagwan Veer Vardhman Swami's lifespan is said to be 72 years. Ashadh Sudi 6, there was Garbha Kalyanak, Kartik Vadi 15, there was Nirvana Kalyanak, so how did it become 72 years? Consider this. It is said in the principles that the days should be counted from the day of conception. And the Aditya Samvatsar. From this, the lifespan is calculated. 'Aicchena Ya Ay' this is the statement of the Jyotishkarand Siddhanta. And the Kalyanak situation is written in the Ritu Samvatsar. This is also said in the Jyotishkarand. Here, the Aditya Samvatsar has 366 days, the Ritu Samvatsar has 360 days, the Chandra Samvatsar has 364 days. And in 5 years, there is one Yuga, in one Yuga of the Aditya Samvatsar, there are 1830 days, and in the Ritu Samvatsar, there are 1800 days. Therefore, in one Yuga of the Aditya Samvatsar, there is one month less than the Yuga of the Ritu Samvatsar. Here, in the fourth month of the Ritu Samvatsar, in the summer season, on Ashadh Sudi 6, there was Chavan Kalyanak. From here, according to the Aditya Samvatsar, in 72 years, on the Kartik Vadi Amavasya day of the Samvatsar, Nirvana was attained. In these 70 years, there were 14 Yugas. Therefore, according to the Ritu Samvatsar, in 14 Yugas, there are 14 months more than the Ritu Samvatsar. From Ashadh Sudi 6, in 14 months, it becomes Bhadrava Sudi 6. But the Aditya Samvatsar is complete, one month before the Ritu Samvatsar begins. So, after that, from Bhadrava Sudi 6, it becomes Ashadh Sudi 6. Here, from here, Nirvana occurred in the second Chandra Samvatsar. And 'Duchche Chand Samvatsare' this is the statement of the Kalpasutra. Here, the Chandra Samvatsar has 364 days. From this, 12 days are complete in the Aditya Samvatsar, in 2 Chandra Samvatsars, there are 24 days more. From Ashadh Sudi 6, in 24 days, it becomes Kartik Vadi Amavasya. And on Amavasya, Nirvana. This is the solution to the 72-year lifespan."

Maae
264
Dasha-Shrutskandha Sutra
Ashtami Dasha

This text clearly indicates that the age of Shri Bhagwan was seventy-two years.

If someone asks why "Hathothara" is written in place of "Uttara-Phalguni", then in the solution, one should say, "Hastaduttarasyam dishi vartmantvat, Hast Uttaro va yaasām tāḥ Hastotharaḥ-Uttara-Phalgunyah", meaning, "Due to being present in the direction east of Hast and north with the moon, the name of Uttara-Phalguni is 'Hastothara'. It is also written in the 'Ardha-Magadhi' lexicon:

Hathothara-stri (Hastothara) Uttara-Phalguni Nakshatra, which comes after Hast Nakshatra, in the language of the time, 'Hastothara' was used in place of Uttara-Phalguni.

Thus, in this Dasha, a brief glimpse of the life of Shri Veer Prabhu has been given. One should learn about the detailed life-story from other Jain texts. Every Muni should live their life according to the appropriate conduct while in the 'Paryushana Kalpa', so that they can attain the state of Nirvana by worshipping Samyak-Darshan, Samyak-Gyan, and Samyak-Charitra.

Thus, Shri Sudha Swami says to Shri Jambu Swami, "O Jambu! Just as I have heard the meaning of this Dasha from the mouth of Shri Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira Swami Ji, I have told you the same. I have not said anything from my own intellect."

Page #363:
---------------------------
## Ninth Dasha

The eighth Dasha describes the 'Paryushana Kalpa'. Every Muni should properly worship it. Those who do not do so acquire Mohaniya Karmas. This Dasha describes the reasons for the bondage of Mohaniya Karmas. The Muni should know the nature of these reasons and strive to remain separate from them. Mohaniya (Mohyatyatmanam Muhyatyatma varnan) is the Karma that deludes the soul or through which the soul gets trapped in delusion. In other words, the Karma whose atoms, upon contact, make the soul devoid of wisdom and mute, is called Mohaniya Karma. Just as the soul often loses its wisdom and consciousness due to the consumption of intoxicants, similarly, under the influence of Mohaniya Karma, the soul becomes devoid of religious activities and, due to the lack of wisdom, starts wandering in the four gatis. The bondage period of this Karma is equal to seventy kotis of kotis of sagars. This Karma is the most important Karma. Therefore, everyone should try to avoid it. To avoid it, the Sutrakar has created this Dasha.

I

Its first Sutra is:

"At that time, in that era, there was a city named Champa. A woman named Punabhadde was the queen, and the woman Koniyaraaya was the goddess. The Sami Samosadhe Pariṣā went out, the Dharma was spoken, and the Pariṣā returned."

At that time, in that era, there was a city called Champa. The Punyabhadra Chaitya was a place of merit. The king was Konika, and his queen was Dharini. The Swami (Lord) was seated in the assembly, and the assembly emerged from the city. The Dharma (righteousness) was spoken, and the assembly returned to its place.

Ninth Dasha
Word-by-word meaning - In that time, in that era, Champa was a city. The Punyabhadra Chaitya was a place of merit. Konika was the king, and Dharini was his queen. The Swami (Lord) was seated in the assembly, and the assembly emerged from the city. The Dharma (righteousness) was spoken, and the assembly returned to its place.
Original meaning - In that time and era, there was a city called Champa. Outside of it was a Chaitya (garden) called Punyabhadra. In that city, Konika was the king. His queen was Dharini. The Lord (Swami) was seated (in the Chaitya). The assembly went to the Lord (to hear his teachings). The Lord spoke of Dharma, and the assembly returned to its place.

Commentary - This Sutra briefly introduces this Dasha. At the end of the fourth Araka, there was a city called Champa. Outside of it, in the northeast corner, was a garden called Punyabhadra. In it was also a shrine to a Yaksha named Punyabhadra. At that time, Konika was the king of that city. His queen was Dharini. The Shraman Bhagavan Mahavira Swami, along with his disciples, was seated in the Punyabhadra garden. The people of the city heard about this and came to him, desiring to hear Dharma from his mouth. The Lord spoke of Dharma, and the people, having heard it, returned to their places.

This introduction is only briefly mentioned here. Those who wish to know it in detail should refer to the 'Aupapatik Sutra'. Reading it will give readers a complete understanding of India at that time. This introduction to the 'Aupapatik Sutra' is of great historical significance. It provides a good understanding of the Indian state administration at that time. Therefore, the 'Aupapatik Sutra' is extremely useful from both historical and religious perspectives. It is advisable for everyone to study it.

What happened after the council departed? Now the Sutrakar describes this:
_Ajjoti! Samane Bhagavan Mahavir Bahve Niggantha Ya Nigganthiyo Ya Amanteta Evam Vayasi “Evam Khalu Ajjo! Tisam Moh-Thanai Jai Imai Itthi Va Puriso Va Abhikhanam-Abhikhanam Ayaremane Va Samayaremane Va Mohnijattae Kamma Pakarei. Tam Jaha" -_

Word by Word Meaning:
Ajjoti - O Aryans! Addressing them in this way, Samane - Shramana Bhagavan - Bhagavan Mahavir - Mahavir Bahve - many Niggantha - Nirgranthas Ya - and Nigganthiyo - Nirgranthis Amanteta - invited them and Evam Vayasi - said this.

## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

**Original Meaning:**  O Aryas! Thus beginning, the glorious Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira Swami invited many Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis and said, "O Aryas! There are thirty places of Mohaniya Karma, which will be described. A woman or man, generally or specifically, repeatedly indulging in these, accumulates bad karma due to the influence of Mohaniya Karma."

**Commentary:** This Sutra first teaches that a benevolent person should provide beneficial teachings with a sense of benefit, even without being asked. Just as the glorious Bhagwan, with a sense of benefit, invited the Sadhus and Sadhvis and educated them, "O Aryas! Due to the thirty reasons to be mentioned, a woman or man earns Mohaniya Karma, and due to them, they wander in the cycle of existence, devoid of liberation. Anyone, generally or specifically, engaging in the actions to be mentioned, falls into the bondage of Mohaniya Karma. Just as there are intentions, they also earn karma of that nature. Therefore, knowing these thirty places well, one should strive to avoid them."

**Ninth Dasha**

Now the Sutrakar describes the thirty places of Mohaniya Karma through verses:

**Verse 1:**

**Original:** जे केइ तसे पाणे वारिमज्झे विगाहिआ ।
उदएण क्कम्म मारेइ महामोहं पकुव्वइ ||१||

**Translation:**  Yaḥ kashchittrasān prāṇān vāri-madhye vigāhya | udakenākramya mārayati mahāmoham prakurute ||1||

**Word by Word Meaning:**  Je - who, kei - any, tase - fear, paṇe - beings, vāri-majzhe - in water, vigāhiā - diving, udayeṇa - by water, karma - action, mārei - kills, mahāmoham - great Mohaniya Karma, pakuvvai - earns.

**Original Meaning:**  The person who kills beings by diving them into water and attacking them with water, earns great Mohaniya Karma.

Page #367:
---------------------------
## Ninth Dasha
**With Hindi Commentary**

**I**

**Commentary:** This sutra describes the first type of Mohaniya Karma. A person who drowns living beings in water, killing them by the impact of water, or drowns them and then kills them with kicks or blows, earns Maha-Mohaniya Karma. Using water to inflict violence on any living being is an extremely cruel act. Just as a wandering ascetic plays in water bodies, similarly, killing a living being for one's own curiosity by feeding it and then killing it is the most heinous act.

One might question whether killing aquatic animals while drowning living beings also results in Maha-Mohaniya Karma. The answer is that the intention of violence is directed towards the killing of living beings at that time, hence the sutra uses the term "Tase Pane". The living being earns Maha-Mohaniya Karma through its own soul (Atmana Mahamoham Prakaroti - Karanabhutenaatmanaatmani Karma Janayati - Utpadayati Falopbhogayogyam Mohaniyam Karmaatmapradeshaih Saha Sansleshayatityartha). This means that the soul itself earns Maha-Mohaniya Karma by killing living beings. By implication, anyone else who commits such an act also falls under the bondage of Maha-Mohaniya Karma.

**II**

Now the sutrakar speaks about the second type of Mohaniya Karma: "Panina Sampihittanam Soyamavariya Paninam. Anto Nadantam Marei Mahamoham Pakuvvai."

**Panina Sampidhaya Srotamaavritya Praninam. Antornandantam Marayati Mahamoham Prakuruate ||2||**

**Word-by-word meaning:** Panina - with the hand, Sampihittanam - covering, Soyam - the flow (mouth and other senses), Avariya - obstructed, Paninam - the living being, Anto Nadantam - with the mouth and other senses closed, making an indistinct sound (like "ghur ghur"), Paninam - the living being, Marei - kills, Mahamoham - Maha-Mohaniya Karma, Pakuvvai - earns, meaning he falls under the bondage of Maha-Mohaniya Karma.

Page #368:

## 300
## Dasha-Shruta-Skandha Sutra
## Ninth Dasha

**Original Meaning:** A person who kills a living being by covering or blocking its sense organs, such as the mouth, with their hand, while making sounds like "ghur-ghur" (a sound of suffocation), earns the Maha-Mohaniya Karma.

**Commentary:** This Sutra describes the second type of Maha-Mohaniya Karma. A person who kills a terrified living being by covering its sense organs with their hand, blocking its breath, and making sounds like "ghur-ghur" (a sound of suffocation), thereby causing violence to the terrified being, earns the Maha-Mohaniya Karma. Such a person, who engages in such cruel acts, has a heart filled with hatred, and their heart becomes increasingly cruel day by day. Therefore, it is natural for them to be bound by the Maha-Mohaniya Karma. According to the principles of conduct, this is considered a cause of untimely death. As mentioned earlier, killing a living being by blocking its senses is a heartless and cruel act. Because the heart of a person engaged in such cruel acts is devoid of compassion, they inevitably become a recipient of the Maha-Mohaniya Karma. This is considered the third type of Maha-Mohaniya Karma, as described in the "Samavayaanga Sutra."

Now, the Sutra-kar describes the third type of Maha-Mohaniya Karma:

**"Jatateyam samarabbha bahu orubhiya janam. Anto dhumena marei (jja) mahamoham pakuvvai."**

**"Jatatejasam samarambhya bahun avarudya janan. Antadhumena marayati mahamoham prakurute."**

**Word-by-Word Meaning:** Jatateyam - fire, samarabbha - by starting, bahu - many, orubhiya - by blocking, janam - people, anto - inside, dhumena - with smoke, marei (jja) - kills, mahamoham - Maha-Mohaniya Karma, pakuvvai - earns.

Page #369:
---------------------------
## Ninth Dasha

**With Hindi Commentary**

**1**

**Original Meaning:** One who sets fire and encircles many people, killing them with smoke, falls into the bondage of the Maha-Mohaniya Karma.

**Commentary:** This Sutra also describes the Maha-Mohaniya Karma bondage arising from the violence against living beings. A person who encircles many people in a pavilion or similar place, sets fire around them, and kills them with smoke, earns Maha-Mohaniya Karma. Killing living beings with smoke is an extremely cruel act. It suffocates the creature, causing it to die in great pain. Thus, the one who kills living beings falls into the bondage of a highly sinful and ignorant act, causing them to suffer for countless eons.

Although intense fire can also harm other living beings, the intention of the killer is only towards those he has encircled. Therefore, the killing of those beings is the main cause of Maha-Mohaniya Karma for him. The 'Samavayanga Sutra' considers this place as the fourth place.

Now the Sutrakar speaks about the subject of the fourth place:

**4**

**Sissamm jo pahnai uttamangammi cheyasa.
Vibhajja matthayam phale mahamoham pakuvvai.**

**Meaning:** One who strikes the head with a wicked mind, knowing it to be the vital part (thinking that death will surely occur by striking it), and breaks the head, earns Maha-Mohaniya Karma.

**Original Meaning:** One who strikes the head and breaks it, because the breaking of the vital part surely leads to death,

Page #370:

## 302
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
One who engages in such evil thoughts, earns the Maha-Mohaniya karma.
## Ninth Dasha
## Commentary
This Sutra also describes the Maha-Mohaniya karma arising from violence against sentient beings.  It means that the fourth Maha-Mohaniya karma is incurred by violence against sentient beings.  A person who, with a wicked mind, strikes another person on the head with a sword or similar weapon, and thus breaks and shatters their most important limb (head), or cuts their neck, earns the Maha-Mohaniya karma.  Of all the parts of the body, the head is the most excellent (superior) limb.  A blow to it inevitably leads to death.  Therefore, the Sutra-kar has used the adjective 'Uttama-anga'.  Through the head, all religious and scientific activities develop.  It is the source of shelter and intelligence.  Therefore, to harm the head in any way with evil intent is a highly despicable and cruel act.  One who does such a thing cannot escape the bondage of Maha-Mohaniya karma.  However, if such an act happens accidentally due to ignorance, then it does not lead to (Maha-Mohaniya).  In the 'Samavaya-anga Sutra', this is considered the fifth position.
## Bondage
Now, the Sutra-kar speaks about the fifth position:
"Sisaa vedhena je kei aavedhei abhikkhanam, tivvaasubha-samayaare mahamoham pakuvvai." || 5 ||
"Sirsamaaveshtena yah kashchidaaveshtayatyabhikshanam, tiivraasubha samaacharo mahamoham prakurute." || 5 ||
## Word-by-Word Meaning
Je - who, kei - any, abhikkhanam - repeatedly, sisaa - head, vedhena - with wet leather, aavedhei - binds, tivvaasubha - intense inauspicious, samayaare - conduct, mahamoham - Maha-Mohaniya karma, pakuvvai - earns.
## Meaning
One who binds the head or other limbs of a sentient being with wet leather, earns this type of...

Page #371:
---------------------------
## Ninth Dasha
**With Hindi Commentary**

**303**

One who acquires the **maha-mohaniya karma** by engaging in extremely inauspicious conduct.

**Commentary:** This sutra also describes the **maha-mohaniya karma** arising from violence against living beings.  A wicked person who ties wet leather on the head of a woman or another being, makes them stand in the sun, and inflicts pain to kill them, becomes bound by **maha-mohaniya karma**. This is because it is an extremely inauspicious act. While doing this, thoughts of violence arise in their mind, and feelings of extreme cruelty develop. It should be understood that engaging in other similar actions also leads to the bondage of **maha-mohaniya karma**. All these **maha-mohaniya karmas** are indicative of causing harm, punishment, and unjust treatment. Therefore, everyone should abandon harm, punishment, and injustice. In the "Samavayanga Sutra," this is considered the second place.

Now the sutrakar speaks about the sixth place:

**6.  Punah punah panihe hanitta uvahase janam. Phalena athava dande mahamoham pakuvvai.**

**Punah punah panihe hanitta uvahase janam. Phalena athava dande mahamoham pakuvvai.**

**Word by Word Meaning:**

* **Punah punah** - repeatedly
* **Panihe** - by deceit
* **Hanitta** - killing
* **Uvahase** - laughing
* **Janam** - foolish people
* **Phalena** - with fruit
* **Athava** - or
* **Dandena** - with punishment
* **Mahamoham** - **maha-mohaniya karma**
* **Pakuvvai** - acquires

**Meaning:** One who repeatedly deceives and kills foolish people with fruit or punishment, while laughing, becomes bound by **maha-mohaniya karma**.

**Commentary:** This sutra also describes the **maha-mohaniya karma** arising from violence against living beings. A cunning person who deceives travelers on the road by wearing various disguises, takes them to a deserted place, and kills them with fruit (spears) or punishment, becomes bound by **maha-mohaniya karma**.

Page #372:
---------------------------
## 304
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

He who laughs (out of delight at the success of his low karma, with a distracted mind) earns mohaniya karma. Due to this, he has to wander through this cycle of existence, taking countless births. Therefore, one who desires their own welfare should not betray anyone, nor should they make fun of another by making them appear foolish.

These six places are related to the maha-mohaniya karma born from violence, speech, and thought. This is the extent of their description. One should imagine other places similar to these.

## Ninth Dasha

Now the Sutrakar describes the places that arise from falsehood:

**Gūḍhāyārī nigūhijjā māyaṁ māyāe chāyaye. Asaccavāī ṇiṇhāī mahāmohaṁ pakuvvai ||7||**

**Gūḍhācārī nigūhet māyāṁ māyāyā chādayet. Asatyavādī naihanvīko mahāmohaṁ prakurute ||7||**

**Word by word meaning:** Gūḍhāyārī - one who is deceitful (and hides their conduct), nigūhijjā - hides, māyaṁ - illusion, māyāe - with illusion, chāyaye - hides, asaccavāī - speaks falsely, ṇiṇhāī - hides the meaning of the sutra, he pakuvvai - earns maha-mohaṁ - maha-mohaniya karma.

**Meaning:** One who hides their faults, covers illusion with illusion, speaks falsely, and conceals the meaning of the sutra, falls into the bondage of maha-mohaniya karma.

**Commentary:** This sutra describes the maha-mohaniya karma born from falsehood. A person who engages in secret misconduct and hides it, covers illusion with illusion, gives false answers to others' questions, and faults the original and answering qualities, or even more so, misrepresents the meaning of the sutra, i.e., hides the true meaning of the sutras according to their own will and gives an irrelevant meaning.

Page #373:
---------------------------
## Ninth Dasha
**With Hindi Commentary**
**2054**

He falls into the bondage of Maha-Mohaniya Karma. In summary, one who consumes vices, covers Maya with Maya, speaks untruth, and falsely accuses others, can never escape the bondage of Maha-Mohaniya Karma.

The commentator of 'Mayaam Mayaaya Chaadayet' explains the meaning as follows:

"Mayaam - Parakeeyaam Mayaam Swakeeyaaya Chaadayet - Jayet. Yathaa Shakunimarakaa Shchadairaatmaanam Aavrutya Shakunin Grihnantaha Swakeeyaaya Mayaaya Shakunim Mayaam Chaadayanti" - Meaning, the person who catches birds or fish using nets, etc., covers himself with his own Maya and deceives the birds or fish with his own Maya.

Now, the Sutrakar describes the subject of the eighth place:

Dhansehi Jo Abhooenaam Akammam Att-Kammuna. Aaduva Tumkaasitti Mahamoham Pakuvvai. ||8||

Dhvansayati Yo'bhooteenaakarmaanamaatma-karmaana. Athava Tvamkaarshiih Iti Mahamoham Prakuruate ||8||

Padaarthaanvaya - Jo - Jo vyakti Akamma - who has not done evil karma, Abhooenaam - with false accusations, or Att-Kammuna - with his own sinful karma, Dhansehi - stains, Aaduva - or Tumkaasi - you did this, ti - saying this, he Mahamoha - Maha-Mohaniya karma, Pakuvvai - earns.

Moolārtha - The person who stains someone who has not done evil karma with false accusations and his own sins, or accuses others saying "you did this", earns Maha-Mohaniya karma.

Teeka - This Sutra describes the Maha-Mohaniya karma that arises from falsely accusing others. The person who stains someone who has not done evil karma with false accusations, and blames others for his own evil deeds like Rishighat, etc., falls into the bondage of Maha-Mohaniya karma. Such...

## 306
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

Individuals become blind to even their greatest faults, but if others, due to ignorance, commit any wrongdoing, they are quick to insult them in public, saying, "Oh, wicked one! You have committed this evil deed. You are a great villain and sinner. It is not even proper to look at your face." Similarly, a person who accuses others of their own faults and exposes the faults of others in public cannot be called a virtuous person. Therefore, a virtuous person should first abandon both of these. A true virtuous person is one who accepts their own faults and patiently endures the faults of others. One who does not do so is a low person and easily falls into the bondage of Maha-Mohaniya Karma.

Now the Sutrakar describes the subject of the ninth place:

**Jaṇamaṇo parisao (sae) saccamoṣāṇi bhāsai. Akkhīṇa-jhañjhe purise mahāmoham pakuvvai.** ||6||

**Jānānaḥ pariṣadam satya-mṛṣe bhāṣate.
Akṣīṇa jhañjhaḥ puruṣo mahāmoham prakuruṭe.** ||6||

**Navama Dasha**

**Padarthanvaya:** - **parisao** - knowing the assembly, **jaṇamaṇo** - knowing, **sacca** - truth, **moṣāṇi** - mixed with falsehood, **bhāsai** - speaks, and **akkhīṇa-jhañjhe purise** - the man who has not ceased from strife, **mahāmoham** - Maha-Mohaniya Karma, **pakuvvai** - earns.

**Mūlārtha:** - A person who knowingly speaks a mixture of truth and falsehood in an assembly, and a man who has not abandoned strife, falls into the bondage of Maha-Mohaniya Karma.

**Tīkā:** - This Sutra describes the Maha-Mohaniya Karma that results from the use of language mixed with truth and falsehood. A person who knowingly speaks a mixture of truth and falsehood in an assembly and always increases strife, because mixed speech naturally increases strife, earns Maha-Mohaniya Karma. This means that if two people are in conflict with each other over something, both...

Page #375:
---------------------------
## Ninth Dasha

**With Hindi Commentary**

**307**

If a knowledgeable person is made a mediator to resolve a conflict, and even though he knows the truth, he starts to say some true and many false things, then naturally, instead of establishing peace, more conflict will arise, and the situation will become even more terrible. As a result, that mediator will incur Maha-Mohaniya Karma. Therefore, whoever is appointed as a mediator anywhere, should try to establish peace between both parties based on truth. This will prevent him from falling into the bondage of this terrible Karma. Along with this, the mediator should not be biased, greedy, or show any favoritism, nor should he accept any bribes.

Now the Sutrakar describes the subject of the tenth place:

**Aṇāyagassa nayavaṁ dāre tasseva dhaṁsiya. || Viulaṁ vikkhobhaittāṇaṁ kiccaṁ ṇṁ paḍibāhiraṁ. ||**

**Padyarthānwaya:**

* **Nayavaṁ:** Minister
* **Tasseva:** Of the same
* **Aṇāyagassa:** King, who has left the burden of his entire kingdom on the shoulders of his ministers
* **Dāre:** Wives or Lakshmi
* **Dhaṁsiya:** Destroying
* **Viulaṁ:** Many other kings
* **Vikkhobhaittāṇaṁ:** Disturbing
* **Kiccaṁ:** Work
* **Paḍibāhiraṁ:** Outside the kingdom
* **ṇṁ:** For the sake of Vakyalankara

**Mūlārtha:**

If a king's minister destroys the king's wives or Lakshmi, and by disturbing the minds of other kings, drives him out of the kingdom (and becomes king himself).

**Tīkā:**

This Sutra states that if a king's minister, with the desire to seize power himself, spoils the king's queens or the avenues of income (wealth), and incites the king's subjects or his subordinate vassals against him, making them hostile, and then, in due time, drives the king out of the kingdom...

## Dasha-Shruta-Skandha-Sutra
## Ninth Dasha

If a minister, driven by self-interest, deposes the king and takes his position, enjoying his queens and royal wealth, rendering the king powerless, he incurs the Maha-Mohaniya karma. However, if the king is wicked or unjust, treating his subjects like a "lion" treats a "deer," as the "Saudas" king did, then, from the perspective of justice, if the ministers depose the cruel king to protect the helpless subjects, they do not fall under the bondage of Maha-Mohaniya karma. However, it is crucial that there is no self-interest involved. If they depose an innocent king out of their own desire for rulership, they cannot escape the bondage of Maha-Mohaniya karma.

In essence, one who deposes a king out of self-interest incurs the bondage of this karma, while one who does it for the benefit of others or for the sake of righteousness does not.

Now, the Sutrakar, in relation to this topic, says:

**Uvagasantampi jhampitta padilomahi vagguhi. Bhog-bhoge viyarehi mahamoham pakuvvai.** ||10||

**Upagachchhantam api jalpitva pratilomaabhir vaagbhih. Bhog-bhogan vidareyati mahamoham prakurute.** ||10||

**Paddarthanvaya:** Uvagatam pi - even when he comes face-to-face, jhampitta - by speaking harsh words, and padilomahi - with unfavorable, vagguhi - words, he scorns him and viyarehi - destroys his bhog-bhoge - enjoyable possessions, he pakuvvai - incurs Maha-moha - Maha-Mohaniya karma.

**Mulaartha:** And when he comes face-to-face, he scorns him with harsh or unfavorable words and destroys his possessions, including his words, he falls under the bondage of Maha-Mohaniya karma.

**Teeka:** This Sutra is connected to the previous one. When the minister deposes the king in the aforementioned manner, if the king, for some reason, comes to him...

Page #377:
---------------------------
## Ninth Dasha

**With Hindi Commentary**

If someone comes and speaks humbly, but then scorns that person (the king) with contemptuous, inappropriate, and adverse words, and destroys their possessions, words, and other special enjoyments, then that person (the minister) falls into the bondage of Maha-Mohaniya Karma.

Here, the king and minister are used as examples. By implication, the same applies to other superiors and their servants. The point is that if a great man trusts his employee, gives him all his authority, and the employee betrays that trust, takes control of all the wealth and property, removes the master from his position, scorns him, and lowers him in the eyes of the people, then that employee earns Maha-Mohaniya Karma. Betrayal is a terrible sin, so those who wish to avoid the bondage of this karma should never do it.

Now the sutrakar speaks about the eleventh point:

**"A person who is not a Kumar-bhoo, but claims to be a Kumar-bhoo, and is attached to sensual pleasures, earns Maha-Mohaniya Karma."**

**Word by Word Meaning:**

* **Je:** who
* **Kei:** any
* **A-Kumar-bhooe:** not a Kumar-bhoo (a young celibate)
* **Ti:** thus
* **Han:** I
* **Kumar-bhooe:** Kumar-bhoo (a young celibate)
* **Vae:** says
* **Itthi-visay-gehie:** attached to sensual pleasures
* **Maha-moham:** Maha-Mohaniya Karma
* **Pakuvvai:** earns

**Main Meaning:**

One who is not truly a celibate, but claims to be a young celibate and indulges in sensual pleasures, earns Maha-Mohaniya Karma.

**Commentary:**

This sutra describes the Maha-Mohaniya Karma that arises from non-celibacy. Anyone who is not a young celibate, but tells people that they are,

The one who is a celibate student (bāla-brahmacārī) and is actually engrossed in the pleasures related to women and is under their control, he accumulates the extremely deluding (mahā-mohanīya) karma. Because his soul is under the sway of both sexual intercourse and untruth.

Here, the author's intention is only with regard to untruth speech, i.e., whoever speaks untruth in any way, he comes under the bondage of the extremely deluding (mahā-mohanīya) karma. Therefore, a person desirous of auspicious wishes should completely renounce untruth speech.

In this sūtra, the term 'kumāra-bhūta' should be understood as 'bāla-brahmacārī' (celibate student).

Now the author speaks about the twelfth place:
Je kei abamhayārī ti ham vae, gaddhaev gavam majjhe vissaram nayai nadam.
Meaning: Whoever is not a celibate (abramhacārī) but says "I am a celibate (brahmacārī)," he makes a harsh (vissvara) sound like a donkey amidst the cows.

The commentary explains that this sūtra also describes the extremely deluding (mahā-mohanīya) karma related to untruth and sexual intercourse. Whoever is not a celibate but says in the public that "I am a celibate," his such saying appears as unpleasant as the sound of a donkey amidst the herd of cows. But he does not know that no matter how much he tries to hide the untruth, it does not remain hidden. The speech that lacks truthfulness is naturally disliked by the virtuous people. Their conscience testifies that a certain person is lying and a certain one is speaking the truth. In this way, once the untruth is revealed,

When the falsehood of a person is exposed, he falls in the eyes of the public, which is naturally detrimental to him. It may be assumed that for some time people may also believe him, but for how long? The reality of things can only exist in truth, not in falsehood.

Now the author again says on the same subject: "Appano ahite bale maya-mosam bahu bhase. Itthi-visaya-gehie mahamokham pakuvvai." (12) The ignorant person who is detrimental to his own self speaks a lot of deceptive falsehood, and being greedy for sensual pleasures of women, he accumulates great delusion (mahamokha).

Padarthanvayah - The ignorant person who is detrimental to his own self speaks a lot of deceptive falsehood (maya-mosam), and being greedy for sensual pleasures of women (itthi-visaya-gehie), he accumulates great delusion (mahamokham).

Tika - In this sutra, the summary of the previous sutra's subject matter is given. That ignorant person, who is like a donkey making harsh sounds, is detrimental to his own self, and he usually considers creating deceptive falsehoods as his pride, and remains ever engrossed and desirous of sensual pleasures of women. But that fool does not realize that all these karmas are pushing him into the darkness of ignorance and are helping in the accumulation of great delusion (mahamohaniya karma). The essence is that when a person commits any kind of secret sin once, he has to commit many more sins to hide it. Therefore, everyone should strive to abstain from such sinful actions.

Thus, having described the subject of the twelfth great-delusion-producing karma, which is related to sexual intercourse, the Sutra-kar now describes the thirteenth place, describing the places related to betrayal and ingratitude:
Whoever earns a living by the support of someone, or by their fame, or by their service, and who covets their wealth, incurs great delusion. ||13||
Word-by-word meaning: Whoever - by the support of whom - or by fame - or by service - earns a living, he - covets - their wealth - incurs - great delusion.
Meaning: Whoever earns a living by the support of someone, or by their fame, or by their service, and who covets their wealth, incurs the bondage of the great-delusion-producing karma.
Commentary: This Sutra describes the subject of the great-delusion-producing karma that arises from ingratitude. If a person earns a living by staying under the protection of a king, etc., or is becoming famous and respected due to his power or his service, and he becomes greedy seeing the wealth of that (king) and steals that wealth in some way or causes it to be stolen, then he incurs the great-delusion-producing karma. Because, by behaving in such an inappropriate way towards the one who has done him so much good, the soul of the doer becomes tainted with the 'fault of ingratitude' and he cannot escape the bondage of that karma in any way. Therefore, every person should learn that ingratitude is a very low sin. One should always strive to avoid this sin.
The word 'Jassasa (Yashasa)' appears in the Sutra. Its meaning is "Yashasa-tasya nripaddeh satkrito'yamiti prasiddhya" i.e. "This person is highly respected in the court of such and such king". The benefits that he gets from this fame.

**Word by Word Meaning:** *Īsareṇa* - by the Lord (master), *aduvā* - or *gāmeṇaṁ* - by the people of the village, *aṇisare* - to a powerless (humble) person, *Īsarīkae* - made him a Lord, and by His grace, *tassa* - his, *saṁpay-hīṇassa* - wealth-less, *sirī* - Lakshmi, *atulmāgayā* - came in abundance.

**Meaning:** If a master or the people of a village made a powerless (humble) person a Lord (master) and by their help he acquired immense wealth.

*Īsā-doseṇa āviṭṭe kalusāvil-ceyase.
Je antarāyaṁ chee'i mahāmohaṁ pakuvvai ||14||*

**Commentary:** This Sutra also describes the subject of the great delusion-inducing karma born from ingratitude. If a noble person or the people of a village together, by their grace, make a poor and orphaned person a 'Lord' and raise him properly, educate him, and make him a respectable person, and in time, if he becomes a famous wealthy person, Lakshmi starts kissing his feet, and he becomes prosperous in every way, and then:

*Īrṣyā-doṣeṇāviṣṭaḥ kalusāvil-cetasā.
Yo'ntarāyaṁ cetayate mahāmohaṁ prakuruate ||14||*

**Word by Word Meaning:** *Īsā-doseṇa* - by the fault of jealousy, *āviṭṭe* - possessed, *kalusāvil* - by the impure mind (or the one with an impure mind), *ceyase* - who, *je* - who, *antarāyaṁ* - an obstacle, *chee'i* - creates, *mahāmohaṁ* - great delusion, *pakuvvai* - he cultivates.

**Meaning:** If, possessed by the fault of jealousy, with a mind polluted by sin, he creates an obstacle in the benefit of his benefactor, he cultivates great delusion.

Page #382:
---------------------------
**Kar Navami Dasha**
314
**Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra**
(Vighna) He who creates obstacles, earns the pakuvvai-acquisition of the maha-mohaniya karma.
**Meaning:** If one who is filled with the fault of jealousy and whose mind is stained with sin, creates obstacles in the benefit of his benefactor and supporter, then he earns the acquisition of maha-mohaniya karma.
**Commentary:** If his mind becomes jealous and hateful towards his benefactor, a noble man, or the people of the village, and becomes stained with sin, and as a result, he begins to create obstacles in their benefit, and out of greed, he seeks to harm them and claim their wealth, and forms a strong enmity with them, then as a result of this ingratitude, he falls into the bondage of maha-mohaniya karma. We have already made it clear that 'ingratitude' is the lowest of low karmas. Therefore, one should always keep in mind that first, we should be able to repay the favors of our benefactor, otherwise, at least we should not harm him in any way.
Now the sutrakar describes the subject of the fifteenth place, which is about betrayal:
**Sappi jaha andaud bhattaram jo vihinsai. Senavai pasaththaram mahamoham pakuvvai. ||15||**
**Sarpiṇī yathāṇḍakandaṁ bhartāraṁ yo vihiṁsati. Senāpatim praśāstāraṁ mahāmohaṁ prakuru te. ||15||**
**Word by Word Meaning:** Jaha - like, sappi - serpent, andaud - her group of eggs, jo - who, bhattaram - nourisher, vihinsai - kills, or senavai - commander, pasaththaram - art teacher or dharma teacher, he pakuvvai - earns the acquisition of maha-mohaniya karma.
**Meaning:** Just as a serpent kills its group of eggs, in the same way, one who kills his nourisher, commander, art teacher, or dharma teacher, falls into the bondage of maha-mohaniya karma.

Page #383:
---------------------------
## Ninth Dasha

**With Hindi Commentary**

**Commentary:** This sutra speaks about betrayal. Just as a serpent kills and eats its own eggs, similarly, one who harms the head of the household, the commander, the king, the minister, and the religious leader, earns the karma of great delusion.  Harming these individuals is such a cruel and base act that the killer cannot escape the bondage of the karma of great delusion.

**315**

The sutrakar compares the aforementioned violence to a serpent eating its own young. The implication is that a mother always nurtures her children. If the mother herself starts consuming them instead of protecting them, who can protect them? Similarly, when the protectors of the home and the state, the head of the household and the king, start harming each other, how can they escape the bondage of the karma of great delusion?

The word "andaud" appears in the sutra. It has two meanings: "and-kut" and "and-put". "And-kut" means its own group of eggs, and "and-put" means the shell of the egg, the two parts that protect the egg. It means that the serpent destroys the shells that protect the eggs.

Because harming these individuals disrupts the lives of many people, the karma of great delusion is ordained for the perpetrator.

Now, the sutrakar describes the sixteenth point in the same context:

**"Je nayagan cha rattass neyaram nigamass va. Settin bahuravam hanta mahamoham pakuvvai ||16||"**

**"Yo nayakancha rashtrasya netaram nigamasya va. Shreshthinam bahuravam hanti mahamoham prakurute || 16 ||"**

**Word by Word Meaning:** Je - who, rattass - of the country, nayagan - leader, cha - and, athava - or, nigamass - of the merchants, neyaram - leader, va - or, bahuravam - very famous, setthi - merchant, hanta - kills, mahamoham - great delusion, pakuvvai - earns.

**Meaning:** One who kills the leader of the country, the leader of the merchants, and the very famous merchant, earns the karma of great delusion.

Page #384:
---------------------------
## Chapter 316 of the Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

This Sutra also describes the act of betrayal of trust. The leader of a nation, the protector of the people, the leader of merchants who guides them on the right path, and the wealthy merchant adorned with the insignia of the deity - these three individuals are highly respected. Many people rely on them and live their lives under their protection. Whoever kills any of these individuals falls into the bondage of Maha-Mohaniya Karma. Because their destruction leads to the loss of livelihood for many dependents, who become destitute and suffer greatly, falling into various other troubles. Their cries of sorrow fall upon the perpetrator, and as a result, they are bound by the aforementioned Karma.

Now, the author of the Sutra describes the subject of the seventeenth verse:

**Verse 17:**

*Bahujanasse yaaram diiv-taanam cha paaninam. Eyarisan naram hanta mahamoham pakuvvai.*

*Bahujanasya netaram dvip-tranam cha praninam. Etadrisham naram hatva mahamoham prakurute.*

**Translation:**

He who kills the leader of many people, the protector of beings like an island, and such a man, incurs Maha-Mohaniya Karma.

**Explanation of the words:**

*Bahujanasse* - of many people
*Neeyaram* - leader
*Cha* - and
*Paaninam* - of beings
*Diiv-taanam* - protector like an island
*Eyaris* - such
*Naram* - man
*Hanta* - killer
*Mahamoham* - Maha-Mohaniya Karma
*Pakuvvai* - acquires

**Meaning:**

The killer of the leader of many people, the protector of beings like an island, and other such men, acquires Maha-Mohaniya Karma.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra describes the Maha-Mohaniya Karma generated by violence against a benefactor. Just as an island protects beings from the sea, so too does one who protects beings in distress, or who, like an island, illuminates those wandering in the darkness of ignorance with the light of knowledge. Whoever harms such a person falls into the bondage of Maha-Mohaniya Karma. In the world, benevolent beings are always ready to help others in distress. For example, great men like Ganadhara endured many hardships themselves to preach for the benefit of the people.

Page #385:
---------------------------
## Ninth Dasha

**With Hindi Commentary**

This has been composed and as a result, thousands have been brought across the ocean of the world and established in the island of religion. If such men are killed, many will suffer immeasurable loss and the killer will earn the karma of great delusion. Due to this, he will have to wander in the cycle of birth and death again and again. Therefore, every individual should not kill benefactors, even by mistake, for the protection of the people and to save himself from the bondage of this karma.

**317**

Those who corrupt others in religion also have to fall into the bondage of the karma of great delusion. Now the sutrakar describes the eighteenth place of this topic:

**Uvattiyam Padivirayam Sanjayam Sutavassiyam.**
**Viukkamm Dhammaao Bhansei Mahamoham Pakuvvai.** || 18 ||

**Upasthitam Prativiratam Sanjayam Sutapasvinam.**
**Vyutkramya Dharmaad Bhranshayati Mahamoham Prakuruate.** || 18 ||

**Word Meaning:**

* **Uvattiyam:** One who is present for initiation
* **Padivirayam:** One who has renounced the world and taken the path of a saint
* **Sanjayam:** One who is restrained
* **Sutavassiyam:** One who is well-versed in austerities
* **Viukkamm:** By force
* **Dhammaao:** From religion
* **Bhansei:** Corrupts
* **Mahamoham:** Great delusion
* **Pakuvvai:** Earns

**Meaning:**

One who is present for initiation, who has renounced the world and taken the path of a saint, who is restrained and immersed in austerity, whoever corrupts him from religion by force, earns the karma of great delusion.

**Commentary:**

This sutra speaks about those who corrupt others in religion. The person who has come to accept the religion in its entirety, and who has accepted the religion in its entirety, i.e., who is following the path of a saint well, whoever corrupts him from religion by force, i.e., deviates him from the path of religion by various false arguments, earns the karma of great delusion.

Page #386:
---------------------------
## 318
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

He earns the karma of harming others. Because he removes them from the path of Dharma, where their soul is immersed in Shruta or Charitra, and leads them towards the five Asravas. This Sutra teaches us that we should not deter anyone from performing their Dharma-related duties. Here, the topic is about Dharma in the form of universal conduct. By implication, we should also understand this in relation to Dharma in the form of conduct specific to a particular country.

## Ninth Dasha

In some handwritten manuscripts, the word "Sutasavvasiyam" is replaced with "Susamahiyam (Susamahitam)" and in some places, the entire phrase "Sanjayam Sutasavvasiyam" is replaced with "Je Bhikkhu Jagajivanam". This means that whoever leads a life of non-violence is the one who deviates from Dharma, etc. However, these variations in the text do not significantly alter the meaning. The goal of all these texts is the same: to prevent anyone from being deterred from their religious duties. Remember, just as earning the karma of harming others arises from deterring someone from Dharma, similarly, the destruction of that karma occurs when we encourage others to follow Dharma.

Now, the Sutrakar describes the topic of the nineteenth place:

## Tavaṇanta-ṇāṇiṇam Jiṇāṇam Varadansinam.
## Tesim Avaṇṇavam Bāle Mahāmoham Pakuvvai. ||16||

## Tathaiva ananta-jnānānām jinānām varadarshinām.
## Tesham avarnavān bālo mahāmoham prakurute ||16||

## Padarthanvaya:

Tathaiva - In the same way, Aṇanta-ṇāṇiṇam - those who possess infinite knowledge, Jiṇāṇam - 'Jina' Devas, Var-shreshtha Dansinam - the best of seers, Tesim - their Avaṇṇavam - one who criticizes, Bāle - ignorant, Mahāmoham - the karma of great delusion, Pakuvvai - earns.

## Mūlārtha:

An ignorant person who criticizes the Jinenra Devas, who possess infinite knowledge and infinite vision, becomes bound by the karma of great delusion.

## Tika:

This Sutra speaks about those who criticize the Jinenras. The 'Jina' Bhagavan, who possess infinite knowledge and infinite vision, are the holders of क्षायिक दर्शन (Kshayik Darshan).

Page #387:
---------------------------
## Ninth Dasha

**With Hindi Commentary**

Those who are devoid of insight are called **sarvadarshis**. By criticizing these great souls, the soul acquires **maha-mohaniya karma**. Those who say that no **sarvagna** has ever existed in the world are merely indulging in **kapolkalpana** (imagination). They say that all the characteristics of a **sarvagna** are just **chandukhana ki gappen** (nonsense) because no **sarvagna** has ever been seen, so how can there be any characteristics? They argue that knowledge is infinite and one person's intellect cannot encompass it all, therefore a **sarvagna** cannot exist. All scriptures are just **vag-jal** (verbal tricks) of the intelligent. It is impossible for one person to see the entire universe at once because there is no evidence for it. Such **hetu-abhas** (fallacious reasoning) leads those who deny the existence of a **sarvagna** to be bound by **karma**. We have already established the **sidhi** (attainment) of a **sarvagna** in the first **sutra** of the first **dasha**.

**Do well**

Now the **sutrakar** (author of the sutras) describes the topic of the twentieth **sthan** (place) in the same context:

**Neiyaï (u) ass maggass duṭṭe avayaraï bahuṁ. Taṁ tippayantō bhāveï mahāmohaṁ pakuvvaï. ||20||**

**Naiyayikasya margasyā duṣṭo'pakarotī bahu.
Taṁ tarpayan bhāvayati mahāmohaṁ prakurute ||20||**

**316**

**Padarthanvasa:**

* **Neiyaïass** - **nyaya** - righteous
* **Maggass** - path
* **Duṭṭe** - wicked or hateful
* **Bahu** - very much
* **Avayaraï** - harms
* **Taṁ** - that path
* **Tippayantō** - criticizing
* **Bhāve** - separates oneself or others from that path
* **Mahāmohaṁ** - **maha-mohaniya karma**
* **Pakuvvaï** - acquires

**Mulartha:**

The wicked soul who harms the righteous path and criticizes it, separating himself and others from it, acquires **maha-mohaniya karma**.

**Tika:**

This **sutra** describes how a wicked or hateful person who vehemently criticizes **samyag darshan** (right faith), etc., and **moksha** (liberation), and thereby misleads **bhavya atmas** (souls destined for liberation) from their true path, acquires **maha-mohaniya karma**.

Page #388:
---------------------------
## 320
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra

He who constantly condemns the path that leads away from the wrong path, turning his own and others' minds away from it, and using his false arguments to prove the righteous path as unjust and condemns it, earns the karma of great delusion.

The word 'Dutte' in the sutra has two meanings: 'Dushta' (wicked) and 'Dveshi' (hateful). The verb 'Avyarei' also has two meanings: 'Apaharati' (takes away) and 'Apkaroti' (does harm). Here, the meaning of 'Apkar' is taken, meaning that he harms the person who is walking on the righteous path by diverting him from it. 'Tippayant' means 'Tarpayant', meaning 'condemning', because the root 'Tipp (Trup)' also means 'condemning'. 'Bhavyati' means 'Nindaya Dveshena Va Vasayati Paramatmananch' etc. The rest is clear.

Now, the sutrakar, in the twenty-first place, speaks about the condemnation of the Acharya and Upadhyaya in the following sutra:

## 21
## Navama Dasha

Airy-Uvajjaaehi Suyam Vinayam Cha Gahie. Te Chev Khinsai Bale Mahamoham Pakuvvai.

Aacharyo Upadhyayaabhyam Shrutam Vinayancha Grahitah.
Tanev Khinsati Balo Mahamoham Prakuruate ||21||

Paddarthanvaya - Airy - Acharya Uvajjaaehi - and Upadhyaya, who have Suyam Shruta Cha - and Vinayam - Vinaya, taught the disciple Gahie - received, meaning taught, Bale - ignorant Cha - if Te Ev - they, Khinsai - condemn, then Mahamoham - the karma of great delusion, Pakuvvai - earns.

Mulaarth - If an ignorant person condemns the Acharya and Upadhyaya, from whose grace he has received the teachings of Shruta and Vinaya, then he earns the karma of great delusion.

Teeka - This sutra speaks about the condemnation of the Acharyas and Upadhyayas. If an ignorant disciple condemns the Acharyas and Upadhyayas who have taught him the Shruta and Vinaya Dharma, saying that...

Page #389:
---------------------------
## Ninth Dasha

**With Hindi Commentary**

An Upadhyaya who is of little learning, whose vision is tainted by association with other Tirthankaras, and whose character is corrupted by the company of Parsva and others, falls into the bondage of Maha-Mohaniya Karma. Therefore, one should always express gratitude towards those Upadhyayas and Acharyas who have lovingly educated them in Dharma, and not be ungrateful by criticizing them with arrogance.

Now, the Sutrakar describes the twenty-second position in the same context:

**Aayari-Uvajjaayaaṇam Sammam No Padittappai. Appaddipuyaye Thadde Mahamoham Pakuvvai. || 22 ||**

**Aachaaryopaadhyaayaaṇ samyag no paritarpati.
Apratipuujakaḥ stabdho mahaa-moham prakurute || 22 ||**

**Word-by-Word Meaning:**

* Aayari - Acharya, Uvajjaayaaṇam - and Upadhyaya, Sammam - properly, No - not, Padittappai - serves, Appaddipuyaye - ungrateful, Thadde - arrogant, Mahamoham - Maha-Mohaniya Karma, Pakuvvai - earns.

**Meaning:**

One who does not properly serve the Acharya and Upadhyayas is ungrateful and arrogant, and therefore earns Maha-Mohaniya Karma.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra also discusses the topic of ingratitude. A disciple who receives education from the Acharya and Upadhyayas but does not serve them in times of need, nor worships them, i.e., does not honor them with food and other offerings at the appropriate time, but instead becomes arrogant and neglects them, falls into the bondage of Maha-Mohaniya Karma. It is the duty of every disciple to serve those Gurus from whom they receive knowledge of Shruta, etc., and to show humility towards them. Only then can their education be successful. One who forgets their kindness, turns away from them, and abandons the virtue of humility, becoming arrogant, cannot escape the consequences of this Karma.

Page #390:
---------------------------
## 322
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Ninth Dasha

The term 'No Tappiai' appears in the Sutra. Its meaning is 'Vinaya Aharo-Padhyadibhi-n Pratyopkaroti', meaning he does not serve them with respect, food, or necessities (like clothes and other equipment).

Now, the Sutrakar describes ego in the 23rd place:

**Abahu-ssue ya je kei sue-n pavikaththai. Sajjhay-vaayam vayai maha-moham pakuvvai. ||23||**

**Abahu-shruta-cha yaha kashchit shrute-n pravikaththate. Swaadhyaaya-vaadam vadati maha-moham prakurute. ||23||**

**Word by Word Meaning:**

* Je - who, kei - any, abahu-ssue - abahu-shruta, ya - and, sue-n - from the scriptures, pavikaththai - praises himself, and, sajjhay-vaayam - self-study-debate, vayai - speaks, he, maha-moham - great delusion, pakuvvai - earns.

**Main Meaning:**

Whoever is truly abahu-shruta, but proclaims himself as such to the public and says, "I read the pure text," earns the karma of great delusion.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra describes the subject of false pride. The person who is not truly abahu-shruta, but for the sake of his fame, goes around saying, "I am abahu-shruta, and I am the only one who can teach the true path of our tradition, and there is no one else who can read the pure text like me." He also falsely praises himself regarding self-study. Such a person falls into the bondage of the karma of great delusion. He not only lies, but also tries to deceive the public. Therefore, he cannot escape the consequences of this karma.

Now, the Sutrakar speaks about penance in the 24th place:

**Atava-ssi-e je kei tave-n pavikaththai. Savva-loy-pare tene maha-moham pakuvvai. ||24||**

Page #391:
---------------------------
##  Verse 323.3

**Verse:**

>  A person who is not a true ascetic, but boasts of asceticism, is a thief of the highest order, deceiving all beings, and thus accumulates great delusion.

**Word-by-word meaning:**

>  Whoever (je) is not an ascetic (atavassi) but boasts of asceticism (tavena pavikaththai) - that is, claims to be an ascetic - is a thief (tene) of the highest order (savvaloya pare) and thus accumulates (pakuvvai) great delusion (mahamoha).

**Explanation:**

>  This verse describes the consequences of false fame. A person who does not practice asceticism but claims to be an ascetic for the sake of public recognition is lying about a virtuous act, and thus binds themselves to the karma of great delusion. This verse teaches us to never use falsehood for self-promotion. The person who seeks false fame is called a thief, and a thief of the highest order (sarvasmat lokat - sarvajanehbyah parah - utkrishtas tenaschoura ity arthah) because they hide the truth from the eyes of the people.

**Next Verse:**

>  A person who is capable of helping a sick person but does not do so, is like a person who does not help themselves.

Page #392:

##  324
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Ninth Dasha

- -

He does not do any karma and says, "Mazzhampime - my service - he does not do Kuwai - does not do, therefore why should I serve him?"

**Meaning:** When someone is afflicted by illness or other troubles, even if they are capable, they do not serve others out of kindness. Instead, they say, "He did not serve me (so why should I serve him)."

**Commentary:** This sutra states that a disciple should serve their Acharya and other Gurus when they are afflicted by illness, etc., purely out of kindness. If someone is capable but does not serve them properly, thinking, "They never did anything for me, or when I was sick, they did not serve me in any way, so why should I bother serving them?" and does not serve them themselves nor advise others to serve them, but only expresses their inability to help out of spite, then...

**Sadhe Niyedi - Pannaane Kalusaul - Cheyase. Appano Ya Abohie Mahamoham Pakuvvai. ||25||**

**Shatho Nikriti-Pragyanaha Kalushakula-Chetaha. Atmanashcha Abohiko Mahamoham Prakuruate. ||25||**

**Word by Word Meaning:** Sadhe - deceitful, Niyedi - in deceiving, Pannaane - skilled, Kalusaul - Cheyase - with a mind full of sin, Appano Ya - and for his own soul, Abohie - generating ignorance, Mahamoham - great delusion, Pakuvvai - he earns.

**Meaning:** He is deceitful, skilled in deceiving, with a mind full of sin, and generates ignorance for his own soul, thus earning the karma of great delusion.

**Commentary:** This sutra is connected to the previous one. That is, the one who is capable but does not help is deceitful, skilled in deceiving, and escapes service at the right time.

Page #393:
---------------------------
## Ninth Dasha

**With Hindi Commentary**

The mind of one who becomes a patient for the sake of others is always impure. Sin always surrounds his mind. Through these actions, he accumulates ignorance for himself in future lives. Because in the world, attaining Dharma comes only through honesty (righteousness - simplicity) and gentleness (good behavior towards others), not through deceit and trickery. Thus, by deceiving, he accumulates ignorance for his soul and also falls into the bondage of Maha-Mohaniya Karma. Along with this, by not serving the sick, he also violates the command of Shri Bhagwan, because the command of Bhagwan is that serving the sick should be the duty of everyone, whoever does it earns the Karma of the Tirthankara lineage. Therefore, one should abandon hatred and serve the sick.

Now the Sutrakar describes the subject of the twenty-sixth place:

**26.  Je kahahigaranaai sampounje puno- puno. Savva-titthaan-bheyaanm mahamoham pakuvvai.**

**Translation:**  Whoever repeatedly uses stories of violence (kahahigaranaai), and if those stories are for the destruction of all the Tirthas (knowledge, etc.), then that person earns Maha-Mohaniya Karma.

**Word by Word Meaning:** Je - whoever, kahahigaranaai - stories of violence, puno- puno - repeatedly, sampounje - uses, and that story, savva - all, titthaan - Tirthas (knowledge, etc.), bheyaanm - for the destruction of, mahamoham - Maha-Mohaniya Karma, pakuvvai - earns.

**Meaning:** Whoever repeatedly uses stories of violence, and if those stories are proven to be for the destruction of Tirthas like knowledge, etc., then that (storyteller) earns Maha-Mohaniya Karma.

**Commentary:** This Sutra speaks about stories of violence. In Kautilya's Arthashastra and Kamashastra, etc., there are such stories, which, upon hearing, naturally incline listeners towards violence and immoral acts like sexual misconduct. Whoever repeatedly uses such stories that are violent and arouse lust, which destroy the path of knowledge, etc. (Tirthas) that help to cross the ocean of the world, or the four main Tirthas (Sadhus), earns Maha-Mohaniya Karma.

Page #394:
---------------------------
##  326
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Ninth Dasha

**Hon**

"If someone repeatedly uses stories, tales of kings, arguments, devices, quarrels, etc. to destroy other Tirthankaras, they acquire the Maha-Mohaniya Karma. Because the Sutra states: 'Sarva Tirtha Bhedaya - Sarvesham Tirthanam - Jnanadi Mukti Marganam Bhedaya - Sarvatha Nashaya Pravartamanah. Jnanadi hi Samsara Sagar Taran Karanani.'  Meaning, all the Tirthankaras, including knowledge and other paths leading to liberation, are destroyed by repeatedly engaging in such stories, and the soul becomes bound by the Maha-Mohaniya Karma."

"However, this punishment is only for 'Anarth-Danda,' meaning violence and other evil deeds done for no purpose, only for entertainment. Because the householder's 'Arth-Danda,' meaning actions done for the protection of their body, are not abandoned. But for the Sadhu, both 'Dandas' are rejected. Therefore, if a Sadhu engages in these actions for any purpose, or a householder engages in them under the influence of 'Anarth-Danda,' or simply to destroy the path to liberation, they will inevitably be bound by the karma. Because by performing these actions, they lead themselves and others towards suffering."

"Every individual should learn from this Sutra that teaching violence and scriptures like the Kama Shastra is sinful and should be rejected by the Bhavyatma."

Now the Sutrakar says in the 27th place, regarding the same subject:

**"Je Ahammiye Joey Sampounje Puno Puno. Saha-Heum Sahi-Heum Mahamoham Pakuvvai."**

**"Yashcha Adharmikam Yogam Samprayunkte Punah-Punah. Shlaghha-Heto: Sakhi-Heto: Mahamoham Prakurute."**

**Translation:**

"Whoever repeatedly engages in unrighteous practices like Vashikaran (hypnotism) for the sake of praise (Saha-Heum) or friendship (Sahi-Heum), they acquire the Maha-Mohaniya Karma."

**Word by Word Meaning:**

* **Je:** Whoever
* **Ahammiye:** Unrighteous
* **Joey:** Practices like Vashikaran
* **Sampounje:** Engages in
* **Puno Puno:** Repeatedly
* **Saha-Heum:** For praise
* **Sahi-Heum:** For friendship
* **Mahamoham:** Maha-Mohaniya Karma
* **Pakuvvai:** Acquires

Page #395:
---------------------------
## Ninth Dasha
**With Hindi Commentary**
**327**

**Original Meaning:** One who repeatedly uses unethical practices like spells for self-praise or to cultivate friendships earns the karma of great delusion.

**Commentary:** This sutra describes unethical teachings and their use. Anyone who repeatedly teaches unethical practices like spells for self-praise or friendship, i.e., teaches the methods of spells according to tantra-shastra, which leads to the oppression (destruction of power) of many beings and causes them to fall into the five 'asravas', diverting them from Dharma and leading them towards unethical actions, earns the karma of great delusion. Because their soul, instead of following the path of 'samvara', gets diverted towards the path of 'asrava'. Regardless of the reason for teaching, the one who teaches will inevitably be bound by this karma.

Now, the sutrakar describes the 28th position, saying:

**28.** "He who desires human or heavenly pleasures, being insatiable, cultivates great delusion."

**Word-by-word meaning:** "Je - whoever, Maanusae - human-related, Bhoae - pleasures, Aduva - or, Paraloiae - heavenly, Te - all of them, Atippyanto - being insatiable, Aasayai - desires, Mahamoham - great delusion, Pakuvvai - earns."

**Original Meaning:** One who desires human or heavenly pleasures, being insatiable, earns the karma of great delusion.

**Commentary:** This sutra states that excessive attachment to worldly desires does not lead to good results. One who desires heavenly, human, or other types of pleasures, being insatiable, earns the karma of great delusion.

Page #396:
---------------------------
## 1328
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Ninth Dasha

He who always desires pleasures and is not satisfied even after enjoying them, earns the Maha-Mohaniya Karma. Because extreme attachment to objects keeps the soul bound in the cycle of birth and death, and to fulfill it, the mind of the person is always afflicted with various Asrava-related resolutions. Therefore, the Bhavyas and the Mumukhsus should completely renounce extreme attachment to objects. Here, the Sutrakar has clearly stated that those who are always engrossed in this subject, never get rid of the bondage of the said Karma.

Here, the meaning of the verb 'Aasvadate' is to maintain desire. Now, the Sutrakar describes the 29th place and speaks about the Devas:

**Iddhi, Jui, Jaso, Vanno, Devanam, Balaviriyam. Tesim Avannavam Bale Mahamoham Pakavvai. ||26||**

**Riddhisutiryaso varnan devanam balam viiryam. Tesham avarnavam bale mahamoham prakurute. ||26||**

**Padyarth Anvaya:** Devanam - of the Devas, Iddhi - wealth like Vimanas, Jui - the radiance of the body and ornaments, Jaso - fame, Vanno - color like white, and Balaviriyam - strength and vigor, Bale - who is ignorant, their Avannavam - criticizes, he Mahamoham - earns the Maha-Mohaniya Karma, Pakavvai - earns.

**Mulaarth:** The wealth, radiance, fame, color, strength, and vigor of the Devas are all real. The ignorant person who criticizes them earns the Maha-Mohaniya Karma.

**Teeka:** This Sutra explains the consequences of declaring a good thing as bad. A person devoid of right knowledge, without knowing that the Devas have wealth like Vimanas, radiance of their body and ornaments, fame everywhere, physical strength, and vigor born from the soul, criticizes them in every way, mocks their power, and despite having the above-mentioned power, ...

Page #397:
---------------------------
Navami Dasa
With Hindi Bhashya Commentary

The ignorant person who desires to worship the Jina, even though he does not see the devas, yakshas, and guhyakas, says that he sees them. He thus accumulates the great deluding (maha-mohaniya) karma.

The meaning is that to consider all substances as 'real' (sat) is the truth. He who proves the 'real' as 'unreal' (asat) accumulates the great deluding (maha-mohaniya) karma.

Now the author, while describing the thirtieth place, says regarding the devas themselves:
"Apassamano passami deve jakkhe ya gujjhage. Annani jina-putthi mahamoham pakuvvati." (Sutra 30)
"Though not seeing, I see the devas, the yakshas, and the guhyakas. The ignorant person who desires to worship the Jina accumulates the great deluding (maha-mohaniya) karma."

Padarthanvaya: The ignorant person (annani) who desires to worship the Jina (jina-putthi), even though he does not see (apassamano) the devas, the yakshas, and the guhyakas, says that "I see (passami) them", he accumulates (pakuvvati) the great deluding (maha-mohaniya) karma.

Meaning: The ignorant person who desires to worship the Jina, even though he does not see the devas, yakshas, and guhyakas, says that he sees them, and thus he accumulates the great deluding (maha-mohaniya) karma.

Commentary: This sutra speaks about the proclamation of his false glory. The ignorant person who desires to worship like the venerable Jina, goes around telling people that he sees the devas - the celestial beings and the lords of the vimanas, the yakshas - the attendants of the devas, and the guhyakas - the lords of the underground abodes, but in reality, he does not see them. He speaks this falsehood only for the sake of gaining fame, and thus he accumulates the great deluding (maha-mohaniya) karma. Because he is so eager for fame that he does not even realize that by lying, he is committing a new sin. The foolish person, in the absence of true qualities, desires to worship like the venerable Jina, and also speaks falsehood regarding the 'vision of the devas', and thus he comes under the bondage of the great deluding (maha-mohaniya) karma.

## Dasha-Shruta-Skandha Sutra

In some written copies, the term 'Jinpuyatthi' is found as 'Janpuyatthi'. This means that the person speaks falsely to gain popularity among the people. This fool, along with this karma, also accumulates 'Durlabha Bodhadi' karmas, resulting in him having to wander in the cycle of existence for an indefinite period.

Thus, having described the thirty aspects of the Maha-Mohaniya karma, the Sutrakar now describes the teachings related to it.

-
**These are the Mohguna Vrutta Kammanta, which are Chit-Vaddhana. Those, O Bhikkhu, should be abandoned and one should engage in Atma-Gavesha.**

**Navama Dasha**

**Pardharthanvaya:** These - these Mohguna - qualities (faults) arising from delusion - are stated. These Kammanta - are those that yield the fruits of unwholesome karma and are Chit-Vaddhana - increasing the defilement of the mind. Those - those which, O Bhikkhu - the Bhikkhu should abandon with certainty and he should engage in Atma-Gavesha - the search for the Self.

**Mulartha:** These (previously mentioned) qualities (faults) arising from delusion, which yield the fruits of unwholesome karma and increase the defilement of the mind, are stated. The Bhikkhu who is engaged in the search for the Self should abandon these and engage in the practice of restraint.

**Tika:** In this Sutra, the Bhikkhu who is engaged in the search for the Self is being instructed. The previously mentioned thirty aspects are stated as being of the Moh karma or, using the word Moh, as being the producers of the eight karmas. These are the qualities of Moh, i.e., the non-qualities. Because the language is Prakrit, the 'a' of 'guna' has been dropped, similar to 'gunehi' being 'aguṇehi'. Their result is unwholesome for the Self, therefore the Sutrakar has used the term 'Karmanta'. This...

## Ninth Dasha (with Hindi Commentary)

**Ninth Dasha**

**With Hindi Commentary**

**Additional factors that increase the defilement of the mind.** Therefore, the Lord commands that the renunciant, being a seeker of the Self or a seeker of the liberated ones, should abandon these and immerse themselves in restraint, which will ultimately lead to liberation from the cycle of existence.

One who desires to see their own Self within themselves is called a seeker of the Self, and one who acts according to the instructions of the Tirthankaras and others is called a seeker of the liberated ones. The point is that to be free from the bondage of karma, such as attachment, one should strive to enter the true nature of the Self by abandoning the aforementioned thirty-two faults.

**Now the Sutrakar gives further instructions to the renunciants:**

**"Even if one knows from before what is right and wrong, having abandoned much, one should vomit them out and serve those who are virtuous."**

**Verse 331**

**Word-by-word meaning:**

* **Itto puvvam:** Before initiation
* **Jampi:** Those who
* **Bahujjhadam:** Have abandoned many
* **Kiccha kiccham:** Right and wrong actions
* **Jane:** Know
* **Tam:** Them
* **Vanta:** Vomit out
* **Tani:** Those
* **Sevijjā:** Serve
* **Jehim:** By whom
* **Ayāravam:** Virtuous
* **Siyā:** Become

**Meaning:**

Before initiation, one should abandon all the right and wrong actions they knew from before, vomit them out thoroughly, and serve those who are virtuous, so that they may become virtuous themselves.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra is also in the form of instruction. When a renunciant takes initiation, they should know well that they are taking initiation only after abandoning all the actions, such as business, etc., that they have done before, and all the unrighteous actions, such as unrighteous conduct, etc. Because as long as one remains a householder, they have to engage in many kinds of right and wrong actions. But after taking initiation, they should abandon all these.

## Chapter 332
## Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
## Ninth Dasha

One should strive to become virtuous by abandoning all worldly attachments, such as family, friends, spouse, and all other relationships, and following only the teachings of the Jinas. One should adopt the dress and lifestyle of the Sadhus and cultivate a pure character, which will enable them to quickly destroy the accumulated karmic burden.

The Sutrakar says:

**Ayar-Gutto Suddhappa Dhamme Hichcha Anuttare. Tato Vame Sae Dose Visamaasi Visan Jaha.**

**Guptachara: Suddhatma Dhamme Sthitvanuttare. Tato Vamet Sukan Dose Visamaasi Visan Jaha.**

**Word by Word Meaning:**

Ayar-Gutto - One with guarded conduct, Suddhappa - Pure soul, Anuttare - Supreme, Dhamme - In Dharma, Hichcha - Residing, Tato - Then, Sae - Their, Dose - Faults, Vame - Abandon, Jaha - Like, Visamaasi - Serpent, Visan - Poison.

**Meaning:**

One with guarded conduct, pure soul, residing in the supreme Dharma, should abandon their faults like a serpent abandons its poison.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra, like the previous one, is in the form of advice. A Sadhu should fully protect their knowledge and conduct, control all their senses, practice restraint with unwavering devotion, and become a pure soul, firmly established in the supreme Dharma (such as forgiveness). They should abandon their faults just as a serpent abandons its poison. Just as a serpent, once it has abandoned its poison in water, does not take it back, similarly, a Sadhu, once they have abandoned their faults, should never take them back in any way. By abandoning faults, their conduct becomes pure, and as a result, they naturally become self-aware.

Page #401:
---------------------------
## Ninth Dasha (with Hindi Commentary)

**333**

Now the Sutrakar describes what a Sadhu, possessing the aforementioned qualities, attains:

**Suctta-dose Suddhappa Dhammatti Viditapare | Ihev labhate kittim peccha ya sugatim varam ||**

**Sutyakta-dosha shuddhatma dharmarthi viditapare | Ihev labhate kirtim pretye cha sugatim varam ||**

**Word-by-word meaning:**

* **Suctta-dose:** Completely abandoning faults
* **Suddhappa:** With a pure soul
* **Dhammatti:** Dedicated to Dharma
* **Viditapare:** Knowing the nature of liberation
* **Ihev:** In this very life
* **Kittim:** Fame
* **Labhate:** Attains
* **Ya:** And
* **Peccha:** In the afterlife
* **Sugatim varam:** The best liberation

**Meaning:**

Thus, by abandoning faults, a pure-souled, Dharma-oriented individual, knowing the nature of liberation, attains fame in this life and the best liberation in the afterlife.

**Commentary:**

This Sutra describes the fruits of the aforementioned qualities. The individual who has abandoned their faults, purified their soul through righteous conduct, is dedicated to Dharma through adherence to scriptures and good conduct, and has understood the nature of liberation, attains fame in this life. This is because they attain various Siddhis (powers), such as Amarshishidhi (the power to cure all diseases with a touch), and become respected throughout the world. After death, their pure soul attains the highest liberation in the afterlife. There are four types of liberation: Siddha-sugati, Deva-sugati, Manushya-sugati, and Sukul-janma sugati. Of these, they attain the highest liberation.

The word "Viditapare" in the Sutra means "Viditam - known, Aparam - liberation, Yena sa Viditapare" - meaning, one who has known the nature of liberation.

Now the Sutrakar concludes this Dasha by saying:

Thus, knowing, the heroes, with firm resolve, having been freed from all the karmas of delusion, have transcended birth and death.

Word-by-word meaning: Thus - in this way, knowing - knowing, heroes - heroes, firm - firm, resolve - resolve, all - all, karmas of delusion - karmas of delusion, freed - freed, birth - birth, death - death, transcended - transcended, so I say - so I say. Deluding places - deluding places, and the ninth category - the ninth category, complete - complete.
Ninth Category
Original meaning: Thus, going, the heroes with firm resolve, having been freed from the eight types of karmas, have transcended birth and death. The deluding places and the ninth category are complete.
I
Commentary: This sutra concludes the ten categories presented. Knowing the aforementioned deluding karmas well, those who show heroism in the practice of austerities, or who are brave in enduring many types of hardships, and who are firm in their resolve on the path of restraint, i.e., those who practice austerities such as upadhana, etc., are freed from all the karmas of the world, transcend the fear of birth and death, and reside in liberation. All those who have been liberated until now have done so through this method, and this is also the path for those who will be liberated in the future.

In this sutra, the word "delusion" refers to the eight karmas - nature - form. In addition, knowledge and character nayas are also described by implication. "Knowing (knowing well)" refers to knowledge, and "heroes with firm resolve" refers to character.

Page #403:

## Ninth Dasha

**With Hindi Commentary**

**- 3353**

The subject matter of this section is the establishment of liberation. It means that when knowledge and character become unified in a single state, the soul becomes free from the eight types of karma and escapes the bondage of birth and death. This state is called liberation.

Action is always connected to its cause, meaning that action cannot exist without a cause. Just as there is no existence of a cloth without threads and no existence of a pot without clay, similarly, there is no existence of birth and death when karma is destroyed. Because karma is the cause of birth and death. This destruction of karma is called liberation, moksha, or nirvana.

Those who are free from the eight karmas are liberated in the past, they exist in the 'mahavidehaadi' realms in the present, and they will be liberated in the future as well. Therefore, the sutra states, "Atichchhieti - in the past, Atishthe - in the past, Ananta-jantavo jati-marane vilanghaya shivam jagmurityartha. Sampratam sankhyata atiyanti - atikramantti bhavishyati kale atyeshyanti cha." The meaning of this has already been explained.

Here, a doubt arises: When the soul is liberated and attains the state of Siddha, is it different from other Siddhas or is it the same? The solution states that it is both different and the same. Jainism is called Syadvada. It considers the soul to be different from a certain perspective and the same from another perspective. For example, according to the 'Dravyastik' nay, the soul remains different in the state of Siddha, because even after liberation, the soul does not lose its essence but remains pure in its essence, free from karma, in liberation. But if we consider it according to the 'Pradesharthik' nay, the soul remains the same in the state of liberation, because there, the infinite Siddhas reside in their respective realms, united with each other. Just as the light of different lamps appears as one, but the lamps themselves are separate, similarly, the realms of the Siddhas remain separate, but there is such unity among them that they do not appear different, but rather the same. And just as there are various emotions in a single mind, so too should we understand the Siddhas.

Page #404:

Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
Navama Dasha

The conclusion is that until the soul destroys all kinds of karma, it cannot be liberated in any way. Each individual's 'samsara' depends on their karma. As long as even a single karma remains, they cannot be freed from the bondage of birth and death. But when their karma is destroyed, no power can prevent them from enjoying the transcendental bliss of liberation. Therefore, those who desire liberation from the bondage of this cycle of samsara should strive wholeheartedly in this direction. As soon as karma is destroyed, they attain liberation. Remember that this destruction of karma does not happen without knowledge and action; they are absolutely necessary.

Thus, Shri Sudha Swami says to Shri Jambu Swami: "O Jambu! Just as I have heard the meaning of this Dasha from the mouth of Shri Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira Swami, so have I told you. I have not said anything from my own intellect."

## Dashami Dasha

The ninth Dasha described the places of great delusion. Sometimes, a Sadhu, under the influence of delusion, while performing austerities, commits 'Nidana' karma. Due to the influence of delusion, the desire for sensual pleasures arises in his mind, and with the hope of fulfilling that desire, he commits 'Nidana' karma. The result is that his desire remains 'Ayati', i.e., for the future, which keeps him bound in the cycle of birth and death. Therefore, the Sutrakar describes only 'Nidana' karma in this Dasha. This is its connection with the ninth Dasha.

This Dasha is called 'Ayati' Dasha. The word 'Ayati' means to know birth or caste. The person who commits 'Nidana' karma will have to take a new birth to experience its fruits. If 'ti' is separated from the word 'Ayati', the remaining 'Ay' means 'profit', i.e., the 'Nidana' karma that brings the profit of birth and death is called 'Ayati'.

That profit is of two types: material and spiritual. Material profit is in the form of the four states of existence, and spiritual profit is the attainment of knowledge, etc. While wandering in the cycle of existence, the soul attains material profit. But when it escapes the cycle of existence, it attains knowledge, etc. This Dasha describes both types of profit. Its initial Sutra is:

In that time, in that era, there was a city called Rajagriha. It was adorned with the Gunasila Caitya. In the city of Rajagriha, there was a king from the श्रेणी (Śreṇī) caste. One day, he bathed, performed the bali-karma, performed auspicious rituals, and wore a garland around his neck, adorned with jewels and gold. He wore a garland of pearls, a three-stringed necklace, and a belt. He was adorned with a garland of flowers, and his fingers were adorned with rings. He was adorned like a Kalpa tree, and he was carried on a palanquin with a canopy held by strong men. He was a beloved sight for all, and he went to the outer hall, where his throne was. He sat on the throne, facing forward, and addressed his family members.

There was a king named Seniya-Srenika. One day, the king bathed, performed balikarma (sacrificial rites) for the strength of his body, and applied oil. Then, for auspiciousness and protection, he applied tilak (mark) on his forehead. He performed auspicious rituals to ward off obstacles and performed prāyaścitta (atonement) by touching the ground with his foot to remove inauspicious omens. He bathed by pouring water on his head, wore a garland around his neck, adorned himself with jewels and gold ornaments, and wore a necklace, a half-necklace, and a three-stringed necklace with dangling pendants on his chest. He wore a waist-band, adorned himself with neck ornaments and rings on his fingers, and thus, like a Kalpavriksha (wish-fulfilling tree), the king, adorned and decorated, was seated on a throne made of flowers and covered with a canopy. Like the moon, he was a pleasing sight. The king, Srenika, came to the outer hall, where his throne was, and sat on the royal throne facing east. He then called his family members and said:

Commentary - This Sutra gives a brief introduction. Its detailed description should be known from the 'Aupapatik Sutra'. The only difference between the story in the 'Aupapatik Sutra' and this one is that there the name of the city is Champa Nagari and the name of the king is Konik. But here the name of the city is Rajgriha and the name of the king is Shrenik. Here, for the convenience of the readers, we give a brief description.
In the last time of the fourth part of this Avasarpini Kal, there was a city called Rajgriha. It was adorned with many buildings and full of wealth and grain. At that time, the people of Magadhdesh and Rajgriha city, or the people of the whole country, were living a happy life. The land outside the city was very beautiful, in which Shaali, Yav and Ikshu were special. In every house of the city, animals like cows were specially raised. There was no street that was not very beautiful and adorned with very tall buildings. The administration of the state was so good that even the names of thieves and bribe-takers were not heard in the whole city. There were many crorepatis in the city. There were also many drama companies in it, which used to show high and educational plays from time to time for the pleasure of the people. The city was surrounded by a rampart on all sides. There was an arched ditch around it. Outside the ditch was another fort. There were strong gates and very dense gates around the rampart.

The upper part of the rampart was equipped with many weapons and weapons like Chakra, Gada, Bhushundi and Shatghni (cannon). The royal road was very wide and always clean. Many skilled artists had left nothing undone in making it beautiful. The doors of the city gates were intricate with Indra nails. The people there were skilled in business and skilled in art and craft.

There. He was so famous for these works that people from all over the country came here to learn these arts. His fame spread everywhere. Outside the city, in the Ishaan corner, there was a Yaksha shrine of a Yaksha named Gun-Sheel. It was famous everywhere for its grandeur and attractiveness. People from all over the country came to see it. Around this Chaitya was a garden, which was famous by the same name. In the middle of that garden was an Ashoka tree, around which were many trees. Under it was a stone slab in the shape of a throne. The garden was surrounded by very beautiful creepers and trees.
In the city of Rajgriha, a king named Shrenik, endowed with all the royal qualities, ruled. Due to his prowess, there was peace in the whole country and the people were experiencing uninterrupted happiness.
Once the king took a bath and, for the vigor of his body, had an oil massage and performed a sacrifice. After that, to remove inauspicious things like Kautuk (tilak on the forehead), Mangal (auspicious things like Siddharthak Dadhyakshtaadi) and bad dreams, he touched the ground with his foot and wore various types of jewels and gold ornaments around his neck. He wore an eighteen-stringed necklace, a nine-stringed half-necklace and a three-stringed necklace. He adorned his body with a waist belt and then wore all the ornaments of his neck. He adorned his fingers with jewel-studded gold rings. He wore jewel-studded Veer-Vali on his feet. Thus, adorned with ornaments from head to toe, he began to look as beautiful as a Kalpavriksha. Then, wearing a canopy adorned with garlands of flowers from the Sakoranta tree, he came out of the bathhouse and began to look as beautiful as the moon emerging from the clouds. From there, he came to the place where the Upasthan-shala (court) was, where his royal throne was, and sat on that high throne facing east. He called the royal officials and said to them:
Go now, you Dev-Anuppiya! Go from this Rajgriha city, to the Jah-Aramaani, the Ujjaanaani, the Aasanaani, the Aayatanaani, the Dev-Kulaani, the Sabhaao, the Pavaao.

There are food halls, lime kilns, trading centers, timber contracts, coal contracts, forest contracts, and factories for making reeds and other types of grass. Go to all the presidents who are working under orders and tell them this.

**Commentary:** This sutra states that the king, sitting on his throne and calling together the officials of the kingdom, began to speak in this way:

"O beloved people of the gods! Go and tell all those who are in charge of the following places outside the city of Rajagriha: places where men and women meet, places of rest adorned with Madhavi and other vines, gardens adorned with leaves, flowers, and fruits, and which are the refuge of many living beings, rest houses, places of debate, places of judgment, assembly halls, temples, meeting halls, water reservoirs for the summer, prosperous shops, trading centers, food halls, lime kilns, large trading centers, timber contracts, coal contracts, forest contracts, and factories for making reeds and other types of grass, and the places where they are sold. Go to all the presidents or officials who are working under orders, and (who are well-known for their authority and obedience to orders) who are the rulers there, and tell them this.

This sutra clearly shows that there is no fixed place for the sadhus. They can reside wherever they wish.

The sutrakar Maharaj explains the king's order in the following sutra:

"Thus, O beloved people of the gods! The king sends this message. When the Samanas, the Bhagavan Mahavira, and the other Tirthankaras, while traveling from village to village, fulfilling their desires, following the path of the ancients, living happily and comfortably, practicing restraint, and controlling their minds, wish to reside in a place, then you should allow them to do so. This is the command of the Bhagavan Mahavira."

**Commentary:** This sutra describes the king's order. King Shrenik ordered his officials, "Go and tell the heads of the aforementioned places, 'The Shraman Bhagwan, the Dharma-pravartak, the one who established the four Tirthas, the one who desires liberation, the Bhagwan Mahavira, who is wandering from village to village in a peaceful manner, contemplating his own soul, is arriving in this city. You should provide him with the necessary provisions for a Sadhu, such as a seat, bedding, etc., and inform the king about his arrival, which is a matter of great joy.' This statement reflects the king's immense devotion to Bhagwan. It is also clear that there was no fixed place for Bhagwan to stay in the city of Rajgriha."

Now the sutrakar says how the officials followed the king's order.

"Then those Kautumbika-purusha, being told by King Shrenik, the Bhambhasara, in this way, were happy in their hearts, and they said, 'Yes, Swami!' They accepted the order with humility. After accepting the order, they left the king's palace. Leaving the palace, they went through the middle of the city of Rajgriha. Leaving the city, they went to the outer gardens of Rajgriha, or wherever the important officials were staying, and they said to them, 'The king has sent us to inform you that he is very happy about this. Please convey this message to him. He is very happy about this.' They said this to everyone they met, until they reached the desired destination."

The king's officials, having heard the king's words, said, "It shall be so, O Master!" and having accepted the king's command with humility, they departed from the king's presence.  Departing from there, they went into the middle of Rajagriha city.  From there, they went to all the places outside the city, such as the parks, and to all the officials who were carrying out their duties, and said to them, "Go and inform King Shrenik of this good news (of the arrival of the Lord), and may it be pleasing to you."  They said this twice and thrice, and then departed in the same direction from which they had come.

The meaning of the text:  After this, the king's officials, having heard the words of King Shrenik and Bhadrabahu, said, "It shall be so, O Master!" and having accepted the king's command with humility, they departed from the king's presence.  Departing from there, they went into the middle of Rajagriha city.  From there, they went to all the places outside the city, such as the parks, and to all the officials who were carrying out their duties, and said to them, "Go and inform King Shrenik of this good news (of the arrival of the Lord), and may it be pleasing to you."

**Commentary:** This sutra states that when the श्रेणिक king gave orders to his ministers, they followed them. The subject of following orders is clear in the original meaning and there is nothing particularly noteworthy. In the sutra, the present tense is often used in place of the past tense, which is not a fault due to its historical nature.

Then, in the city of Rajgriha, at the crossroads, three-way intersections, four-way intersections, and other famous squares,

1. Dashaśrutaskandhasūtra
2. Tenth Dasha
The renowned assembly went to the presence of the venerable Bhagavān and, with reverence, began to worship him, desiring to listen to the Dharma.

Commentary - At that time and in that place, the promulgator of the Dharma, the founder of the four Tīrthas, the venerable Ascetic Lord Mahāvīra, was wandering from one village to another, adorning his soul through asceticism and austerity, and had taken up residence in the Guṇaśaila Caitya of the city of Rājagṛha. Then, on receiving the news of the Bhagavān's arrival, the people of the city, from the triangular, quadrangular, and other multi-angular streets, gathered enthusiastically to have the darśana of the Bhagavān and to listen to his teachings. Each person was experiencing infinite bliss and was singing the glories of the Bhagavān. The greatness of his darśana was being extolled on all sides. The entire city was filled with this clamor. Thereafter, the entire populace, with devotion, proceeded towards the Guṇaśaila Caitya to have the darśana of the venerable Bhagavān and to drink the nectar of his teachings that flowed from his lotus-like mouth. In this way, they presented themselves before the lotus feet of the venerable Bhagavān and began to worship him with devotion and love.

Now the sūtrakāra, relating to the same subject, says:

"Then the elders went to where the ascetic Lord Mahāvīra was - they approached the ascetic Lord Mahāvīra, saluted him thrice, and after saluting him, asked about his name and lineage. Having asked about his name and lineage, they approached him. They met him one by one, and after meeting him one by one, they went aside. Thus they spoke, 'He, whose devotee the king Śreṇika Bimbisāra desires to see, longs for, and craves for, that ascetic Lord Mahāvīra is the first Tīrthaṅkara.'"

King Shrenik, the Bंभसार, desires, yearns, requests, and aspires for the darshan (sight) of the Devānupiya (beloved of the gods). King Shrenik, the Bंभसार, is delighted and satisfied upon hearing the name and lineage of the Devānupiya. The Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir Swami, the Adigar (founder of the religion), the Tiththayar (establisher of the four Tirthas), the Savvannu (omniscient), the Savvadansi (all-seeing), the Puvvaanupumbin (walking in sequence), the Charemane (walking), the Gamaanugaman (going from one village to another), the Dutijjamane (going), the Suhan Suhenam (comfortably), the Viharmane (dwelling), has arrived here. He is residing in the Gunashala Chaitya, outside this Rajagriha city. He is present in this Gunashala Chaitya, engaged in the Bhavamane (meditation) of his own Atma (soul) through Samam (restraint) and Tap (austerity).

Mulaarth - After this, they went to the place where the Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir Swami was, along with the attendants of comfort, etc. They circumambulated the Bhagavan three times, offered their respects, and prostrated themselves before him. After the prostration and salutations, they inquired about his name and lineage and held it in their hearts. After this, they all gathered together and went to a secluded place and began to speak to each other in this way: "O Dev-Priya!

## The Tenth Chapter

**With Hindi Commentary**

**351**

**1**

The omniscient and all-seeing Lord Mahavira, moving in sequence, happily wandering from one village to another, has arrived in this Rajagriha city and is residing in the Chaitya called Gunasail outside the city, adorning his soul with restraint and austerity.

**Commentary:** This Sutra describes Lord Mahavira's arrival at the Gunasail Chaitya and the conversation between the leaders. This is all clear in the original meaning. The Lord's name should be known as Shri Vardhaman Swami and his gotra as Kashyap. Although many words in the Sutra seem to have the same meaning, this is not actually the case. For example, Vandana means to praise virtues, and Namaskar means to bow down in respect. The meanings of the rest of the words are as follows:

* **Kaanksha:** Hope of not losing a possessed object.
* **Sprha:** Desire to obtain an unpossessed object.
* **Prarthana:** Requesting an unpossessed object from helpers.
* **Abhilasha:** Continuous desire for a beloved object.

**Samprāpt** means residing in the Chaitya called Gunasail outside the Rajagriha city. Similarly, one should know about the other words.

Now, the Sutrakar, continuing with the same topic, says:

"Let us go to him, the beloved of the gods! Let us inform the king of the army that it is good for him. They hear each other's harsh words. They go to the Rajagriha city just as they are. They go to the middle of the Rajagriha city. They go to the house of the king of the army just as they are. They go to the king of the army just as they are. They go to the king of the army, having received the royal order, and they celebrate the victory, having celebrated it thus."

Then, let us go, O beloved of the gods! We shall convey this message to the king of the Shreniks. May it be pleasing to you. Having said this, they promise each other, and having promised, they go to the city of Rajagriha. Having gone to the city of Rajagriha, they go to the house of the king of the Shreniks, where the king of the Shreniks is. Having gone to the king of the Shreniks, they clasp their hands together and greet him with victory and conquest. Having greeted him, they say, "Whose master desires to see him, as long as the Lord Mahavira dwells in the virtuous Caitya, we, the beloved of the gods, convey this to you. May it be pleasing to you."

Padyarthanvaya - Tam - Therefore, Devana-uppiya - Beloved of the gods, Gacchamo nam - We go, Seniyass - Shreniks, Ranno - King, Eyamatu - This auspicious news, Nivademo - We convey, Bhe - Your, Piyam bhavatu - May it be pleasing, Tti - Thus, Kattu - Saying, Annam-annass - To each other, Vayanam - Words, Padisu-namti - They promise, Padisu-naitta - Having promised, Jenev - Where, Rayagihe - Rajagriha, Nagare - City, Tenev - There, Uvagacchanti - They come, Uvagacchaitta - Having come, Rayagih - Rajagriha, Nagaram - City, Majjham - Majjhe-na - In the middle, Jenev - Where, Senie - Shreniks, Raya - King, Tenev - There, Uvagacchanti - They come, Uvagacchaitta - Having come, Seniyam Rayam - To the king of the Shreniks, Karayalam - Hands, Parigah-iya - Clasped together, Jav - As long as, Jaenam - Victory in one's own country, Vijayenam - Victory in foreign countries, Vaddaven-ti - They say, Vaddaven-itta - Having said, Evam Vayasi - Thus they say, Jav - As long as, Se nam - He, Samane - Shraman, Bhagavan - Lord, Mahavir - Mahavira, Gunasile Cheie - In the virtuous Caitya, Jav - As long as, Viharati - He dwells, Devana-uppiya - Beloved of the gods, Tass nam - His, Piyam - Auspicious news, Nivademo - We convey, Atah Bhe - Therefore, Sriman ka - Your, Piyam - May it be pleasing, Bhavatu - Be.

## Dashami Dasha
**With Hindi Commentary**

**Original Meaning:** Therefore, O beloved of the gods! We are going and will convey this good news to King Shrenik. May it be pleasing to you, they said to each other. After this, they went to the city of Rajgriha, and in the middle of the city, where the royal palace of King Shrenik was, where the great king was seated, they went there. Going there, they joined their hands and congratulated the great king with victory and success, and said, "O Master! The Shraman Bhagwan Mahavir Swami, whose darshan you have a strong desire for, is seated in the Chaitya called Gunashil outside the city. Therefore, we convey to you the good news of his arrival. May this news be pleasing to you."

**Commentary:** This Sutra only describes that the aforementioned presidents conveyed the news of the arrival of Shri Bhagwan Mahavir to King Shrenik. The rest is clear in the original meaning. But "Jay - Paraira Nabhibhuyatamanata Pratapvridhi Cha, Vijay - Paresh Am Sahamananam Abhibhav, Athava Jay Swadeshe, Vijay Paradeshe Bhavati. Te Cha Jayen Vijayen Vardhasveityashi Sham Prayunjanta" - meaning, not being despised by the enemy and the increase of prowess is called Jay, and giving retribution to those who are jealous of one's progress is called Vijay. Or, Jay is in one's own country, and Vijay is in other countries.

The meaning of the Sutra is only that the presidents went to the king and conveyed the good and auspicious news of the arrival of Shri Bhagwan. The king listened to this news with respect and happiness.

What happened after this, the Sutrakar himself says:

**Then, King Shrenik, upon hearing this news from those men, was filled with joy and happiness in his heart, and he rose from his throne. He went out as if someone was going to worship and bow down. After bowing down, he honored those men.**

**With Hindi Commentary**

The men, having completed the aforementioned tasks, approach the king and report that all the work has been done properly.

**Original Meaning:** Upon hearing this news from the men and contemplating it in his heart, the king Shrenik was filled with joy and satisfaction. He then rose from his throne, performed a bow and offered salutations. He then honored and respected the men, and after giving them a gift of love sufficient for their livelihood, he dismissed them. After dismissing them, he summoned the city guards and said to them, "O beloved of the gods! Thoroughly irrigate and cleanse the city of Rajagriha, both inside and outside." After completing all these tasks, they report to the king.

**Commentary:** This sutra states that when King Shrenik heard the news of the arrival of Lord Mahavira from the heads of the departments, he immediately rose from his royal throne. He then descended from the throne by stepping on the footrest and performed a single-step ritual, washing his face with water. He then walked seven or eight steps in the direction where Lord Mahavira was seated and, with proper ritual, offered salutations to the Siddhas and Lord Mahavira with the words "Namostu Namo" and expressed his boundless devotion. After this, he returned to his royal throne and honored the men with clothes and other gifts, and treated them with special respect through kind words. He was so pleased with them that he did not simply dismiss them with honor and respect, but also gave them wealth sufficient for their livelihood for the rest of their lives. This gift of love, or "Preeti-daan" (a gift given out of love for the Lord), was given to those who brought the news of the Lord's arrival, out of his special affection for the Lord. After dismissing them, he summoned the city guards and commanded them, "O beloved of the gods! Today, you must specially irrigate and cleanse all the places inside and outside the city with water..."

## Dasha-Shruta-Skandha-Sutra

Water it, clean it, plaster it smoothly, make it fragrant, and decorate it well. The point is, you should not have any flaws in decorating the city. Today, the festival of the Lord's arrival will be celebrated. They do all this and then go to the Maharaja and request him.

**Dashami Dasha**

Here, the Sutrakar has described it briefly. Those who are curious about its special form should know its detailed description from the 'Aupapatik Sutra'.

What happened next, the Sutrakar himself says:

"Tato ṇam se seṇie rāyā balavāuyaṁ saddāveištta evaṁ vayāsī - khippameva bho devāṇuppiyā! Hayagaya rah joha-kaliyaṁ cauraṅgiṇiṁ seṇam saṇṇāheha, jāva te vi paccappinaṭi."

"Then, that श्रेणिक (Shrenik) king, having summoned the commander of the army, said thus: 'Quickly, O beloved of the gods! Prepare the four-armed army, consisting of horses, elephants, chariots, and warriors, until he also returns.'"

**Padyarthānwaya:**

Tato ṇam - Then, se - that, seṇie - श्रेणिक (Shrenik), rāyā - king, balavāuyaṁ - commander of the army, saddāveiš - calls, and saddāveištta - having called, evaṁ vayāsī - thus said, bho devāṇuppiyā - O beloved of the gods, khippameva - quickly, tum - you, hay - horses, gaya - elephants, rah - chariots, and joha-kaliyaṁ - warriors, cauraṅgiṇiṁ - four-armed, seṇam - army, saṇṇāheha - prepare, jāva - until, te vi - he also, paccappinaṭi - returns to the Maharaja.

**Mūlārtha:**

After this, Maharaja Shrenik called the commander of the army and said, "O beloved of the gods! Quickly go and prepare the four-armed army consisting of horses, elephants, chariots, and warriors." When the Maharaja's order was fulfilled, they came and informed him.

**Tīkā:**

This Sutra states that Shrenik Maharaja dismissed the city guards after giving them the order to decorate the city, and then called the commander of the army.

He commanded him to quickly go and prepare a Chaturangini army equipped with horses, elephants, chariots, and warriors. Upon receiving the command, the army commander prepared the army accordingly and came to the Maharaja and requested that the army was ready as per his command.
Now the question arises, what is the meaning of the word 'Bal-Vyaaprit'? In response, it is said, "Bal-Vyaapritam-Sainya-Vyapaar-Paraayanam Sainya-Chinta Niyuktam Va", meaning that the one who is engaged in the business of the army or is engaged in the thought of the army is called Bal-Vyaaprit or army commander.
Now the Sutrakar, in relation to this, says:
Tate Nam Senie Raya Jaan-Saliya Sadavai, Jav Jaan-Saliya Sadavitta Evam Vayasi-'"Bho Devanuppiya! Khippamev Dhammiyam Jaan-Ppavaram Juttamev Uvatthaveh, Uvatthavitta Mam Eyamanattiyam Pacchpinahi".

After this, the Shreni-Raja (chief of the guild) called the Yaan-Shalik (the superintendent of the chariots) and said to him, "O beloved of the gods! Quickly prepare the principal, righteous chariot and make it ready. Fulfill this command of mine and inform me." After this, he, the Yaan-Shalik,

## Dashami Dasha
**With Hindi Commentary**

Hearing the king's order, the heart of the Shrenik Raja was filled with joy and satisfaction. He went to the chariot-house. Entering the chariot-house, he saw the chariots, cleaned them by removing dust and other debris, then lowered them, removed the coverings, and brought them out of the chariot-house. He adorned them and parked them in a designated place (on the royal road).

**Commentary:** This sutra states that after the army was ready, Shrenik Raja called the chariot-house keeper and told him to quickly prepare the most important and complete chariots for the Dharma-prayoga (religious practice). Upon receiving the order, the chariot-house keeper went to the chariot-house, brought out the chariots, cleaned them, adorned them well, and parked them in a designated place.

The commentator of "Dhammiyam Jaan-Ppavaram" explains it as follows: "Dharma is the purpose, or it is used for Dharma, or it is Dharmic. Or, the chariot used for traveling for the sake of Dharma is called a Dharmic chariot. Among these Dharmic chariots, the one that is superior, the best, and equipped with qualities like speed, is the one that is to be prepared and presented."

Then, the sutra-writer continues in the same vein:

"He goes to the chariot-house, enters the chariot-house, looks at the chariots, cleans the chariots, removes the coverings from the chariots, lowers the chariots, cleans the dust, adorns the chariots, prepares the chariot-platform, places the chariot-driver, enters the main road, mounts the chariot with the foot-stool and foot-rest, and then goes to the place where the Shrenik Raja is." 

This is what should be done.

**Translation:**

Then, after this, he did the following: He joined his hands and said, "Jāv-yāvat" (as long as) and "vayāsi" (in this way), "Sami" (O Master!), "Te" (Your) "Dhammie jāṇappvaram" (religious knowledge) "Shreshtha dharmik yān" (best religious vehicle) "jutte" (is appropriate), "Ādidvān" (as the great one) "jaise" (as) "Shrimān" (the Lord) "ne ājñā ki thi" (had commanded), "vah pūrṇ ki gai hai" (it has been fulfilled), "Bhaddant" (O Venerable one!), "yān par chaṛhne vālon kā kalyāṇ ho" (may those who ride this vehicle be blessed). The king accepted this blessing with "vagguhin" (words).

**Original Meaning:** He went to the place where the vehicle-shed was, entered the vehicle-shed, saw the vehicles, cleaned them, patted them with his hands, then took them out and removed their coverings. He adorned them with beautiful and excellent ornaments. Then he attached them to the chariots and stood them on the road, placing a whip on top of each one. He seated a man to hold each whip and, driving them along the "rathya" (road), he came to where the Shrenik king was. He joined his hands and said humbly, "O Master! As you commanded, your chief religious chariot is ready. May those who ride the vehicles be blessed." The king also accepted these blessings.

**Commentary:** This sutra is connected to the previous sutra. The "yān-shālik" (vehicle-keeper) adorned the chariots and went to the vehicle-shed. He decorated the "vṛṣhabhādi" (bull, etc.) vehicles well and attached them to the chariots. He took them to the king and said, "O Master! The well-equipped vehicles are ready as you commanded."

There are many variations in the reading of "Vattmaggam gāheti." For example, "Vadum gāhiti," "Vaduṁ gāhiti," and in the "Aupapātikasūtra," "Vattmaggam gāheti" and "Chaḍumaggam gāheti." But the commentator has accepted the last word and explained it as follows: "Chaḍu-maggam gāheti" - "Vartma grāhayati" - "Yānāni mārge sthāpayati" (meaning, he places the vehicles on the road). "Pradodayaṣṭi" refers to the whip. "Antarāsam-padansi" - in some places, the reading is "Antarāpatoḍansitti." You should also know about other words like this.

  Now the Sutrakar says that upon hearing this news, King Shrenik of Bhadrasala, having been pleased and satisfied, entered the bathing house.  Having entered, he was adorned and decorated like a Kalpa tree.  Then, the king emerged from the bathing house and went to where Chellanā Devi was and said to her, "Oh, beloved of the gods! The Shraman, Bhagavan Mahavira, the first Tīrthankara, lives by practicing the ancient path, and he cultivates himself through restraint and austerity."
  Word-by-word meaning: Tate ṇam - after that, Seṇie Rāya - King Shrenik, Bhaṃbsāre - of Bhadrasala, jāṇa-sāliyasssa - of the chariot-house, antie - from the end, eyamṭuṃ - this news, soccha - hearing, nisamma - and having understood, haṭṭuḍhe - pleased and satisfied, jāva - until, majjaṇa-gharaṃ - the bathing house, aṇuppavisai - he enters, aṇuppavisaiṭṭā - having entered, jāva - until, kappa-rukkhe ceva - like a Kalpa tree, alaṃkie - adorned, vibhūsie - decorated, ṇarinde - the king, jāva - until, majjaṇa-gharaō - from the bathing house, paḍinikkhamaī - he emerges, paḍinikkhamaīṭṭā - having emerged, jeṇeva - where, Chellaṇādevi - Chellanā Devi was, teṇeva - there, uvāgaccaī - he went, raṭṭā - and, evaṃ - thus, vayāsī - he said, devāṇuppie - Oh, beloved of the gods! evaṃ - thus, āigare - the dharma,

**The Founder of the Ten Precepts - The Establishment of the Tirthas**

The Jains - as long as they are restrained - the Shraman Bhagavan - the Bhagavan Mahavira - Mahavira Swami - from the beginning - in sequence - while wandering - while dwelling - have arrived here.

**363**

**Original Meaning:**  After this, Maharaj Shrenik, hearing this from the Yan-Shalik, and having determined it in his heart, was delighted and satisfied. Then he entered the bathhouse and from there, wearing fine clothes and ornaments, he emerged, adorned like a Kalpavriksha. Then he went to Chellan Devi and said, "O Beloved of the Gods! The founder of Dharma and the establisher of the four Tirthas, Bhagavan Mahavira Swami, is wandering in sequence, and while practicing restraint and austerity, he is dwelling with his soul."

**Commentary:** This Sutra describes how Maharaj Shrenik, upon hearing the news of the preparation of the chariots from the Yan-Shalik, was extremely pleased. He immediately went to the beautifully decorated and extremely pleasant bathhouse. There, he sat on a beautiful bathing platform and bathed according to the rituals. After coming out of the bathhouse, he went straight to Maharani Chellan Devi and said, "O Beloved of the Gods! Shraman Bhagavan Mahavira Swami is dwelling outside Rajgriha city, meditating in the virtuous Chaitya."

This Sutra briefly describes this. Its detailed description should be known from the 'Aupapatik Sutra'.

**Again, the Sutrakar, in relation to this, says:**

"O Dev-Anuppie! We will go to that great fruit, to those Arhants, O Dev-Anuppie! We will worship, bow down to, honor, and respect the Shraman Bhagavan Mahavira. We will wish for his well-being and prosperity. We will dwell in this way."

This, both in this life and in the next life, will be for the benefit, happiness, forgiveness, liberation, and continuity of the lineage. Therefore, that Chellanā-devī, having heard this matter from the king, was delighted and satisfied, and accepted it.

## The Tenth Dasha

**With Hindi Commentary**

**Honour them.** The Lord is auspicious, benevolent, the Lord of Lords, and wise. Therefore, let us go and perform their **paryupasana** (service). This **paryupasana** will be for our benefit in this world and the next, for our happiness, for our well-being, for our liberation, and for happiness in all the series of births and deaths.

Hearing this news from King Chellanadadevi, she was delighted and satisfied in her heart. She accepted the King's proposal and agreed.

**Commentary:** This sutra describes the greatness of seeing the Lord, etc. King Shrenik went to Chellanadadevi and said, "O beloved of the gods! The mere sight of the Arhant and the Bhagavants, and the hearing of their name and lineage, bears great fruit. Then, how much fruit will there be in going to them, offering them obeisance and prostration, listening to their teachings, and serving them? It is beyond description. Whoever listens attentively to their invaluable teachings and holds them with faith, obtains continuous happiness in this world and the next. Therefore, O beloved of the gods! Let us also praise the Shraman Bhagavan Mahavira Swami. Let us offer him obeisance. Let us honour him with clothes, etc., and respect him with proper offerings. The Lord is auspicious, the Lord of Lords for removing suffering, the embodiment of knowledge. Therefore, let us perform his **paryupasana**, because his service will be beneficial, happy, prosperous, or empowering, liberating, and happiness-giving in the series of births and deaths."

Hearing these words from King Shrenik's mouth, Chellanadadevi was very pleased and readily accepted the King's proposal.

**I**

This sutra describes the fruit of devotion to the Lord. Wise men praise the Lord in this way and obtain happiness in this world and the next. It seems that the creation of hymns, etc., is based on this sutra. Praising the Lord purifies the results, which leads to the accumulation of auspicious actions. The result is that the soul experiences only happiness everywhere due to the influence of auspicious actions. For him, everything is auspicious.

Or from the hunchbacked maidservants, from the maidservants of the Kirata country, and from the group of Mahत्तरग-Vind-Mahत्तरक, surrounded by them, where there is an outer hall, where the king of the श्रेणिक was, there she comes, and coming there, then the king of the श्रेणिक, along with Cheल्लणादेवी, climbed onto the best chariot, which is difficult to ascend, and having ascended, he was adorned with a garland of Korint flowers, and he was carrying a parasol, and in this regard, it should be known from the supplementary sutra. As long as the king worships the Bhagavan, and in the same way, Cheल्लणादेवी, surrounded by the Mahत्तरग-Mahत्तरक (servants of the inner palace), comes to where the श्रमण Bhagavan Mahaवीरे was, and coming there, she worships the श्रमण Bhagavan, and prostrates to him, then she stands before the king of the श्रेणिक, and while standing, she serves or worships him.

Original Meaning - Coming to where the bathing house was, she bathed, performed Balikarma (oil massage, exercise, etc. to strengthen the body), performed Kautuk Karma, performed auspicious karma and atonement to remove inauspiciousness. What to describe, she wore anklets on her feet and a string of gems on her waist, adorned her limbs with bangles and rings, wore a necklace of pearls, a three-stringed Margav (special ornament), and a special ring-shaped ornament, and a Hem (made of gold) thread. She wore earrings. All these ornaments made her face very bright. Adorned with jewels on all her limbs, she wore silk clothes made in China, and covered herself with a soft, shining, and beautiful cloth made from Dhake Bengal thread.

**With Hindi Commentary**

On the tenth day, adorned with fragrant flowers, dangling earrings, and colorful garlands, her body anointed with the finest sandalwood, her limbs embellished with exquisite ornaments, perfumed with incense like guggul, dressed like the goddess Lakshmi, surrounded by numerous maidservants from the Kubja and Kirata lands, and other attendants of the inner palace, Queen Chellanādevi arrived at the outer reception hall where King Shrenika was waiting. King Shrenika then ascended the royal chariot, adorned with a canopy of Korint flowers. The details of this event can be found in the **Aupapātika Sūtra**. The king devoted himself to serving the Lord. Similarly, Queen Chellanādevi, surrounded by all the inner palace attendants, went to where the Jina, Lord Mahāvīra, was, and praised him, offered him salutations, and then, standing behind King Shrenika, devoted herself to the Lord's service.

**Commentary:** This sūtra describes how Queen Chellanādevi, upon hearing news of the Lord's arrival, went to the bathhouse, bathed, and adorned herself with clothes and ornaments. Then, accompanied by King Shrenika, she boarded the royal chariot and went to serve the Jina, Lord Mahāvīra. A detailed account of this event can be found in the **Aupapātika Sūtra**. The only difference is that the story there is attributed to King Konika, while here it is attributed to King Shrenika. The essence of the entire sūtra is that King Shrenika, with great ceremony, went to serve the Lord, and the queen, surrounded by maidservants from seventeen countries and elderly men, also went to see the Lord. Both of them then devoted themselves to his service.

Having heard the Dharma, the assembly dispersed, and the Shreni king also departed.

Tīkā - This Sutra describes that when all the assemblies - like the assembly of the Rishis, the assembly of the Yatis, the assembly of the humans, the assembly of the Devas, the assembly of the Sadhus, the assembly of the Mahavratis - gathered at the lotus feet of the Shraman Bhagavan Mahavira Swami, and countless other individuals...

And so, the group of Bhavanpati, Van Vyantar, Jyotish and Vaimanik Devas also gathered with great eagerness. Then, Sri Bhagwan, with supreme power, narrated the story of Shruta and Charitra Dharma to the assembled listeners. He described the Karma-Prakritis, proving each Dravya to be endowed with Utpada, Vyaya and Dhrauvya. He also described Ashrava and Sanvara, and explained Nirjara and Moksha, the knowledge of which would lead the Jiva towards the path of Moksha. The complete details of this Dharma-Katha should be known from the 'Aupapatik Sutra'.

The assembled council was extremely delighted to hear the Dharma-Katha from the mouth of Sri Bhagwan. They became eager to accept the Dharma-Niyamas as per their capacity and, praising Sri Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira Swami from their hearts, returned to their respective homes. Along with them, Maharaja Shrenik and Chellanadavi also returned to their royal palace, praising Bhagwan.

What happened then? Now, the Sutrakar says about this very subject:

**Tathegaiyanaṁ Nigganthaanaṁ Nigganthiinaṁ Ya Seṇiyaṁ Raayaṁ Chellaṇaṁ Ca Deviṁ Pasitta ṇaṁ Ime Eyāruve Ajjaṭṭhite Jāva Sankappe Samuppanjitthā.**

Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
Commentary - This Sutra describes how the minds of many monks were filled with resolve upon seeing King Shrenik and Queen Chellana. For example:
Tenth Dasha
"Oh, how wonderful! King Shrenik, the wealthy, who is enjoying great happiness, having bathed, performed the bali-karma, performed auspicious rituals and atonement for desires, and is enjoying the best human pleasures with Queen Chellana, adorned with all ornaments, is wandering about. We have not seen such a god in the world of gods. If this is the result of his tapas, brahmacarya, and secrecy, then we too will come (in time) and wander about enjoying such excellent human pleasures. This is good."

Word by word meaning:
Aho - wonder, ṇam - for the sake of the grammatical structure, Seṇie Rāya - King Shrenik, Mahidḍhi - very wealthy, Mahā-sukkhe - with great happiness, Je ṇam - who has, Hāe - bathed, Kay-balikamme - performed the bali-karma, Kay-kouy-mangal-pāyachchitte - performed auspicious rituals and atonement for desires, Savvālaṅkāra-vibhūṣie - adorned with all ornaments, Chellanadevīe sadḍhiṁ - with Queen Chellana, Urālai - excellent, Māṇussagāī - human, Bhoga bhogāī - pleasures, Bhuñjamāṇe - enjoying, Viharati - wandering about.

The devas-gods have not seen this (person) in the deva-loka (divine realm). Verily, this is the deva-deva (supreme god) himself. Therefore, if there is any special fruit-result of your (his) austerity, vows, and brahmacharya-protection, then we too shall wander, enjoying these same generous human pleasures in the future time. This is proper.

The meaning is: It is astonishing that King Shrenika, who is extremely wealthy and experiences complete happiness, has performed bathing, rituals, amusements, auspicious rites, and penances, and is wandering around adorned with various ornaments, enjoying the best sensual pleasures with Chellanadeyi. If there is any special fruit-result of his austerity, vows, and brahmacharya-protection, then we too shall wander, enjoying these same generous human pleasures in the future time. This is our excellent thought.

The commentary explains that the ascetics present contemplated both meditative and reflective spiritual thoughts upon seeing King Shrenika. Here, the reflective thoughts of desire are described, where the ascetics thought that the king possessed high palaces, abundant wealth and grains, radiant appearance due to wearing many ornaments, a strong and healthy body, and widespread fame, and thus he is extremely happy. They also thought that if there is any special fruit of his austerity, vows, and brahmacharya, then they too would enjoy similar generous human pleasures in the future.

Page #442:
---------------------------
374
Dasha-shruta-skandha-sutra
If there is a special fruit of merit, then we too will wander in the next birth, enjoying such excellent human-related activities and pleasures. This is our thoughtful consideration, which is virtuous, i.e., excellent. This very resolve arose in the minds of those virtuous ones at that time, upon seeing King Shrenika.
Tenth Dasha
I
In this sutra, "bhog-bhog-ai" etc. are given in the neuter gender. These are all Prakrit, and therefore not blameworthy. Because, according to the sutra "vyatyaya-cha," there are variations in Prakrit due to special characteristics. "Naiv maya drishta-avalochita dev-loke-ity-ek-vachanam sadhya-vasayik-tvad vakt-ur-apekshya" etc.
Here, a doubt may arise: why did such resolves arise in the minds of the virtuous ones in the presence of the Lord? In the solution, it is said that if this happens due to chhadma-sthata, then there is no wonder.
Now, the sutra-kar describes what thoughts arose in the minds of the virtuous women upon seeing Chellan-adevi:
"Oh, Chellan-adevi is very wealthy, and she is very happy, having bathed, performed sacrificial rites, and performed auspicious rites of atonement, adorned with all ornaments, and she is wandering with King Shrenika, enjoying human pleasures. I have not seen such a goddess in the heavenly realms. Truly, this goddess is capable. If there is a special fruit of merit in this good conduct, in the observance of vows, in the practice of brahmacharya, and in the observance of vows, then we too will wander in the next birth, enjoying such excellent human-related activities and pleasures. This is virtuous."

Oh, Chellan-adevi is very wealthy, and she is very happy, having bathed, performed sacrificial rites, and performed auspicious rites of atonement, adorned with all ornaments, and she is wandering with King Shrenika, enjoying human pleasures.

"Oh, what a wonder! We have never seen such a goddess in the celestial realms. This is indeed a goddess. If there is a special fruit of good conduct, austerity, rules, and celibacy, we too will enjoy such excellent pleasures in due time. This is indeed good."

**Explanation:**

The passage describes the astonishment of the virtuous women upon seeing Queen Chellan Devi, who is adorned with all kinds of ornaments and enjoys the highest pleasures with the king. They wonder if this is a goddess, as they have never seen such a being in the celestial realms. They believe that if their good conduct, austerity, rules, and celibacy have any special fruit, they too will enjoy such pleasures in the future. They consider this thought to be excellent.

"You will enjoy the same kind of pleasures as the Settas"- this is your thought, Saahu-Shreshtha.  Aho Nan - it is amazing, Chellanadadevi - Chellanadadevi is Mahiddiya - extremely wealthy, Sundara - beautiful.  Se Tan Saahuni - this is also the thought of the Sadhvis, Se - Ath Yanan - certainly, Ajjo - O Aryas!  Eyam Dhe - is this talk Sam Dhe - correct?  Hearing this, the Sadhus and Sadhvis present replied, "Hanta Atyi - yes, Bhagavan! You are right."

Original Meaning - O Aryas! Shraman Bhagavan Mahavira Swami invited those many Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis and said, "Seeing Shrenik Raja and Chellanadadevi, such spiritual resolutions arose in your minds that it is amazing that Shrenik Raja is so wealthy and we will also enjoy such pleasures in the future - is this correct? Aha! Chellanadadevi is extremely wealthy, beautiful, and the Sadhvi Ganas' thought is correct? O Aryas! Do you have such thoughts?"  Hearing this, the Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis present said, "Yes, Bhagavan! This is correct."

Commentary - In this Sutra, the omniscience of Bhagavan and the truthfulness of the Aryas is illuminated.  When the aforementioned resolutions arose in the hearts of the Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis, at that very time, Shraman Bhagavan Mahavira Swami called them all and said, "O Aryas! Have the aforementioned resolutions arisen in your hearts?"  They said, "You speak the truth.  Such resolutions have definitely arisen in our minds."

In the Sutra's "Se Nunan" etc. phrase, the word "Se" has the meaning of "Ath".  For example - "Se" wordo Magadhadesh-Prasiddha - Athshabdartha vartate.  "Ath" wordastu vakyopanyasarthah pariprashnaarthova.  Yadaha - "Ath prakriyaprashnaantaryamangalopaanyas-prativachanasamucchyeshu.

For example, "O long-lived Shramans! For those souls who have abandoned external (wealth, grain, etc.) and internal (kashya, etc.) bonds, this Nirgrantha-Pravachan-Dwadashanga-Vani is:

1. **True**, because it shows the beneficial and true path.
2. **Unanswerable**, because it is the proponent of things as they are, i.e., it describes things as they are.
3. **Complete**, because it is complete with all the qualities of liberation.
4. **Pure**, because it is unique and there is nothing greater than it.
5. **Very Pure**, because it is all-encompassing and free from blemishes.
6. **Logical**, Nayanasheela-Naiyayikam-Moksha-Prapakam-Nyayopapann-wa-Moksha-Prapti ka Karan hai. It is the cause of liberation.

##  Chapter 380 of the Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra, Tenth Dasha

In this, the beings who are established with a steady mind attain the attainments of Anima etc., attain Kevala-Jnana, become detached from all types of karma, become peaceful-minded by being free from all types of karmic stains, and all their physical and mental sufferings are destroyed, etc. Thus, the glorious Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira Swami described the greatness of Nirgrantha-Pravachan. Nirgrantha-Pravachan mainly describes two subjects - Shruta-Dharma and Charitra-Dharma. Both of these are conducive to the welfare of the soul.

Nirgrantha-Pravachan refers to the scripture in which Nirgrantha, i.e., Shraman-Dharma, is specifically expounded. Its analysis is as follows: "Nirgranthanaam idam nairgrantham, pravachanam - prakarashanabhividhinochyante jeevadayaha padartha yasmin tat pravachanam shastramityartha."

Now the Sutrakar describes what the glorious Bhagwan said next:

"Whoever, while dwelling in the presence of the Nirgrantha Dharma, is afflicted by hunger, thirst, wind and sun, deformed and disfigured, and tormented by various afflictions, and is driven by desire, and strives, and sees these fierce sons and great mothers, sons of enjoyment and great mothers, who are about to depart, and in front of them, a great slave, servant, worker, and man, at the end, throws a parasol and a garland, and departs."

And while striving in the path of restraint, he sees the sons of noble lineage, whose mothers are of great lineage, and he sees one of them surrounded by many servants, maidservants, attendants, and laborers, exiting or entering the house, holding an adorned umbrella.

**Commentary:**

* This sutra explains what the ascetic sees that motivates him to practice restraint. The person who has embraced the Dharma, who is present to learn and practice the teachings, and who has already endured all hardships, if he experiences hardships again and desires arise in his mind, even then he strives in the path of restraint.

Dashaśrutaskandhasūtra
Daśamī Dasha
Although the arising of sensual desires occurs, he still engages in the path of restraint and while wandering, he sees the great maternal ones (mahā-mātṛka-jina), whose mothers and, by implication, fathers are of noble lineage and endowed with qualities such as beauty and virtue, as well as the fierce sons (ugra-putra) and the pleasure-seeking sons (bhoga-putra). The 'ugra' lineage sons are "established by the primordial deity as protectors," and the 'bhoga' lineage sons are "established by the primordial deity in the role of preceptors." He sees them surrounded by numerous slaves (dāsa), maidservants (dāsī), servants (kiṃkara), and workers (karmakara), carrying parasols, fans, and whisks, entering and exiting the house - in other words, he sees a person of great affluence. In this sūtra, along with 'ugra-putra' and 'bhoga-putra,' some also read 'mahā-saudya' (mahā-svāduka), meaning those who are extremely fond of sensual pleasures and diversions.

In the commentary on the term 'purādigicchāya' in the sūtra, the commentator writes that 'deśī' Prakrit uses the word 'digicchā' to mean 'hunger' (bubhukṣā). This extreme state of hunger, due to the fear of non-restraint, leads to the desire for food, drink, and other such things. Thus, the meaning is that when the experience of adversities (parīṣaha) begins to arise, the arising of sensual desires occurs in the mind. The result is that the mind becomes engrossed in weaving a garland of resolutions upon seeing the affluent individuals.

Now, the sūtra-author, continuing the connection from the previous sūtra, says:

Thereafter, he sees in front of him the great elephants (mahā-āsāvasarā), the excellent elephants (ubhayo teṣiṃ nāgā nāgavarā) behind the chariots (piṭṭhao rahā rahavaraḥ), and the retinue (saṃgallī) carrying the parasol, the fan, and the whisks, and he lifts that up (uddhariya) and holds the parasol (seya chattaṃ abbhuggayaṃ), grasps the fan (bhiṃgāre pagga-hiya), and waves the whisks (tāliyaṃṭe paviyanna seya-cāmarā) repeatedly (abhikkhaṇaṃ abhikkhaṇaṃ) with great reverence (atijāti ya nijjāti ya). Then, he bathes (nhāya) and performs the ritual worship (bali-kamma) as before.

Original Meaning - After this, there are large horses. On both sides are large and prominent elephants. Behind them are large and excellent chariots and a group of chariots. Above them, an umbrella is raised high. They hold a "jhāri" (a whisk) in their hands. The "talavṛnta" (a type of fan) is used to create a breeze. White "chamara" (fly whisks) are waved. Thus, when they enter or leave their home, they appear extremely radiant. They are adorned with all kinds of ornaments after performing their ritual bath, offerings, and meals. Then, the expansive, dome-shaped hall is illuminated by lamps throughout the night. In it, they are surrounded by groups of women, enjoying the best of human pleasures, accompanied by the sounds of loud, rhythmic drumming, dancing, singing, stringed instruments, cymbals, clappers, the "trutita," the "ghana," the "mridanga," and the "maddala," all played by skilled performers.

Commentary - This sutra describes the prosperity of the sons of the "Ugrakula" (fierce clan) and the "Bhogakula" (pleasure-seeking clan). When the sons of the "Ugrakula" and others leave their homes or enter them, they are accompanied by horses, elephants, and chariots, as well as auspicious objects like umbrellas. The dome-shaped hall where they reside is illuminated by lamps throughout the night. They are surrounded by many women.

And in that hall, there are always plays and various musical instruments (playing). In this way, they wander, enjoying the best of human pleasures.

Regarding the "Kutaakara-shaala", the commentator writes: "Kutaakara-shaalaaya iti - Kutasya eva girishikharasya evaaakaro yasyaah saa kutaakaraa, yasya uparyaachchaadanam girishikharakaaram saa kutaakaraana shikharikruityopalakshitaa shaalaa kutaakara-shaalaa, upalakshanam chaitat praasaadaadiinaam.

Nirjanata ke kaaran kutaakara-shaala ka grahan kiya gaya hai, kyonki is mein vishesh bhogon ka bhog hota hai. Shesh sutraarth sugam hi hai."

_In relation to the above sutra, the sutrakar now says:_

Tassanam egamavi aanaavemaanasas jaav chattari panch avutta cheva abhuttuti-bhan devaanuppiya! Kim karemo? Kim uvanemo? Kim aharemo? Kim aaviddhaamo? Kim bhe hiya ichchiyam? Kim te aasagass sadati? Jam pasitta nigganthe nidaanam kareti.

**Original Meaning:** When a servant is called, four or five others appear on their own, without being called, and say, "O Dev-priya! Tell us, what shall we do? What food shall we offer you? What object shall we bring? Tell us quickly, what shall we do? What is the desire of your heart? What object pleases your mouth, seeing which the Nirgrantha performs Nidana Karma?"

**Commentary:** This Sutra reveals that even the Bhikshu performs Nidana Karma upon seeing such enjoyments and sons of enjoyment. These fierce sons of enjoyment have such wealth and influence that when they call only one servant for a necessary task, four or five others appear out of curiosity, without being called, and say, "It is our good fortune to have the opportunity to serve you, therefore, O Dev-priya! Command us, what shall we do for you? What food shall we offer you? What object shall we bring for your service? What is the desire of your heart? What substance pleases your holy mouth?" Seeing such wealth, the Nirgrantha performs Nidana Karma. The word Nidana means the resolve, etc., caused by the attraction of worldly enjoyments.

Now the Sutrakar speaks about the Nidana Karma of the Nirgrantha:

"If this dwelling of yours, following the rules of the Brahmacharya, is to be maintained, and you are to be supported, then indeed, for the Nirgrantha, Nidana Karma is the cause of his staying in that place. He does not get rid of it for a long time, for a month, for a year. He is reborn as a deity in other Dev-lokas. In the great ones, in the long-lived ones, he becomes a deity there. He remains in the great ones, in the long-lived ones. Then, from the Dev-lokas, by coming, by going, by staying, he is reborn in another birth. And those fierce sons of enjoyment, the great sons of enjoyment, they are reborn as sons in another family."

If the aforementioned fruit of this austerity, discipline, and celibacy is indeed true, then, O long-lived ascetics!

## Dasha-Shruta-Skandha-Sutra
## Tenth Dasha

A being who has renounced the world, who is a son of the Ugra and Bhog lineages, is born as a son in one of those lineages. _Commentary: This Sutra reveals that when a Nirgrantha, upon seeing the Ugra and Bhog sons, resolves in his mind that if there is any special fruit of the austerities, restraint, rules, and celibacy vows he has undertaken, then he will surely experience such pleasures in due time, and does not criticize himself for this resolution to his Guru, nor does he acknowledge his mistake and perform penance through austerities, etc., to purify this undesirable karma, then the result is that at the time of death, he is born as a god in one of the Bhavanapati, Vyantar, Jyotishka, or Vaimanika divine births, becoming a Mahardhika deva. There, he himself becomes Mahardhika and long-lasting. When his accumulated lifespan, position, and Bhava karma in the divine realm are exhausted, he leaves the divine body without any interval and is born as a son in one of the lineages of the Ugra and Bhog sons._

The Sutrakar continues, in accordance with this:

"Se nam tattha daraye bhavati sukumala-pani-paaye jav suruve. Tate nam se daraye ummukka-balabhave vinnay-parina-yamatte nam atijayamana-ssa va puro jav maham dasi-das jav kim te. Asagassa sadati."

"Sa nu tatra darako bhavati, sukumara-pani-pado yavat surupa. Tato nu sa daraka unmukta-balabhave vijnana-parinata-matro yauvanakamanupraapta svayameva paitrikam pratipadyate. Tasyanu atiyato (nirgato) va purato mahadasi-dasa yavatkim tava-syakasyasvadate (ityadi)."

Word-by-word meaning: "Se" - he, "nam" - indeed, "tattha" - there, "daraye" - child, "bhavati" - becomes, "sukumala-pani-paaye" - with soft hands and feet, "jav" - until, "suruve" - beautiful. "Tate" - then, "nam" - indeed, "se" - he, "daraye" - child, "ummukka-balabhave" - having left childhood, "vinnay-parina-yamatte" - having matured in knowledge, "nam" - indeed, "atijayamana-ssa" - having gone beyond, "va" - or, "puro" - before, "jav" - until, "maham" - great, "dasi-das" - servants, "jav" - until, "kim" - what, "te" - your, "asagassa" - desires, "sadati" - are satisfied.

**Translation:**

He is born with a beautiful form. After that, leaving behind his childhood, he matures in knowledge and attains youth. He automatically inherits his paternal inheritance. Then, as he enters his home, many servants and maidservants are eager to ask him what he desires, as they find his presence pleasing.

**Original Meaning:**

He is a beautiful and delicate child there. After that, he leaves behind his childhood and attains knowledge and youth, automatically becoming the owner of his paternal property. Then, as he enters the house (and exits the house), he is surrounded by many servants and maidservants, who ask him what he likes.

**Commentary:**

This sutra shows the result of nidana karma. When he is born in one of the aforementioned families, his form is extremely beautiful, and his hands and feet are very delicate. He is adorned with various auspicious marks, such as the swastika. His body is well-proportioned and complete. He is pleasing to behold, like the moon. Being fortunate, he attracts everyone. He has exceptional intelligence, which succeeds in every task, so he becomes knowledgeable or wise. When he is young, he automatically takes possession of his paternal property and becomes its owner. Then, when he enters the house or leaves the house, if he calls for a servant for some task, four or five appear without being told and consider it their good fortune to follow his commands. They immediately carry out the received orders and are always eager to hear further commands. They say, "O master! What do you desire? We are always at your service..."

"Now the Sutrakar speaks about Dharma in the context of Nidana Karma:

"Would such a man, of that kind, be told the Dharma, the Dharma that is known only by the omniscient, by a Shraman or a Mahama, at any time? Yes, he would be told, but he would not listen or accept it. He is not fit to hear that Dharma. He is full of desires, undertakes great endeavors, has many possessions, is unrighteous, and will go to the hell of the south, and will be difficult to awaken.

## Dashami Dasha
**With Hindi Commentary**

The one who initiates acts of violence, possesses a great attachment (mamata), is egoistic, irreligious, south-bound (dakshinagami), destined for hell (nairyik), and will have a rare (dullhab-bohie) awakening in the next life (aagami janma) - such a person exists. Thus, O long-lived Shramanas! This is the consequence (vivage) of that karmic seed (nidanas), which makes one incapable of hearing the Dharma (dhamma) preached by the Kevali (pannatta).

**Original Meaning:** Can such a person, whether a Shraman or a Mahaan (Shravak), hear the Dharma preached by the Kevali? Yes, one can say, but it is not possible for him to hear that Dharma because he is not worthy of hearing it. He is one who has intense desires, initiates great deeds, is irreligious, follows the southern path, is destined for hell, and will have a rare awakening in the next life. O long-lived Shramanas! This is the consequence of that karmic seed, which makes the soul incapable of hearing the Dharma preached by the Kevali.

**Commentary:** This Sutra describes the consequence of the karmic seed in relation to Dharma. Shri Gautam Swami asked Shri Shraman Bhagwan Mahavir Swami, "O Bhagwan! Can a person who has this karmic seed, whether a Shraman or a Shravak, hear the Dharma preached by the Kevali?" Bhagwan replied, "O Gautam! A Shraman or a Shraman Upasak can preach Dharma to him, but he will not be able to hear it due to his karmic seed. O Ayushman! Shraman! This karmic seed has such a consequence that it makes the one who possesses it incapable of hearing the Dharma preached by the Kevali. Therefore, the karmic seed is completely undesirable. It has three types: Jghanya, Madhyam, and Utkrishta. Here, it is said that the one who possesses the Utkrishta karmic seed is incapable of hearing Dharma, not the others. Those who possess the Madhyam and Jghanya karmic seeds can attain Dharma Shravan or Samyaktvaadi after the karmic seed arises. There are many scriptural proofs of this, such as Krishna Vasudev or Draupadi."

Now the Sutra-kar (author of the Sutra) describes the subject of the second nidana (cause) karma:

Thus, O Shramanas (ascetics)! I have declared the Dharma (religion), this very Nirgrantha (liberated) discourse brings an end to all suffering. For the sake of the Dharma, the Nirgranthi (liberated one) who is present, living, and who was formerly driven by hunger, born of desire, would wander, she would strive, she would strive and see - and then, if that woman is one, one wife, adorned with one garment, well-cared for like a vessel of oil, well-guarded like a vessel of water, equal to a casket of jewels, then, whether she is very outgoing or very withdrawn, in front of her, there are great slaves and servants (who are) - what does she taste of the mouth that, seeing her, the Nirgranthi makes a nidana (cause)?

Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
Tenth Dasha

If a Nirgranthi, present to receive the teachings of this Dharma, becomes afflicted by hunger, thirst, or other bodily needs, and succumbs to the desires of the senses, and sees a woman who is the sole wife of her husband, adorned with garments and ornaments of a single kind, whose husband protects her as a lamp of sesame oil is protected in the land of Saurashtra, who is well-received like a chest of fine clothes, and who is beloved by her husband like a casket of jewels, and who is surrounded by many male and female servants both inside and outside the house, and at the call of one servant, four or five others appear unbidden, eagerly awaiting her commands and respectfully inquiring what she desires, then the Nirgranthi makes a judgment.

Now the Sutrakar describes how the act of judgment arises from seeing:

"Santhi imassa sucharissassa tava-niyama-bhambacheer jav bhunjamani viharami se tam sahooni."
"Astyasya sucharitasya, tapa-niyama-brahmacharayasya-yavad bhujana viharami, tadetat sadhu."

Word-by-word meaning:
"Imasssa" - of this "sucharissassa" - virtuous conduct "tava" - your "niyama" - rules "bhambacheer" - of celibacy "jav" - if "bhunjamani" - enjoying "viharami" - I also wander "se tam sahooni" - this is good.

Meaning:
"If there is any special fruit of this pure conduct, your rules, and celibacy, then I too will enjoy such pleasures. This is a good hope."

Commentary:
This Sutra explains that when the Sadhvi sees the aforementioned woman, she begins to hope in her mind that she will experience such pleasures as the fruit of her own tapas, rules, and celibacy. This hope is the act of judgment.

Now the Sutrakar speaks of the fruit of the said Karma:
"Thus, O Shramanayushman! The Nigganthi Nidana Karma, having been done, without being reviewed, and having passed the time of death, is reborn as a deity in one of the Devalokas. In the Mahiddhikas, as long as she remains a deity, as long as she enjoys pleasures, then, due to the exhaustion of the Ayuh-kshaya, Bhav-kshaya, and Sthiti-kshaya of those Devalokas, she abandons that state and is reborn as a daughter in one of the families of the Ugra-putras, Maha-svadukas, or Bhog-putras, Maha-matrikas. There, she is born as a beautiful and delicate girl."

Padyarthanvaya:
Shramanayushman - O Ayushman! O Shraman!
Evam Khalu - Thus, certainly
Nigganthi - Nirgranthi

Dashami Dasha
Mulaartha - O Ayushman! Shraman! In this way, by performing Nirgranthi Nidana Karma, and without discussing it with a Guru, and without retreating from it, at the time of death, she is born in one of the Deva-lokas, in the form of a Deva. She becomes a Deva among the powerful Devas. There, she wanders, experiencing all the divine pleasures. Then, from the Deva-loka, due to the decay of lifespan, existence, and state, without any interval, she leaves the Deva-body, and is born as a daughter in one of the Kulas of those who are the Mahamatruka of these ages and enjoyments, and who are lovers of enjoyments. There, she is a delicate and beautiful girl.

Teeka - In the previous Sutra, it is said that by performing Nirgranthi Nidana Karma, one is born as a son in the Ugra or Bhog Kula. Here, it is said that in the same way, by performing Nirgranthi Nidana Karma, one is born as a daughter in one of those Kulas. Her hands and feet are delicate, and she is beautiful, because the types of resolutions that arose in her mind while she was practicing austerities, she receives the fruits of those resolutions in the same way. But all this is the fruit of austerity and restraint, that she receives the fruits of her desires. If worldly people make such resolutions, it is not possible for them to be fulfilled. In this world, everyone eats the laddoos of their mind.

Then she becomes his wife (bhāriyā bhavati), she is his only wife (ēgā ēgajāyā), she is beloved and dear to him (iṭṭā kantā) like a jewel box (rāyan-karaṇḍaga-samāṇā). Before her, entering the house (atijāyamāṇiē vā) or leaving the house (nijjāy-māṇiē vā), there are many maidservants and servants (mahāṁ dāsī-dās) who please her husband's eyes (ki tē āsagassa sadati).

**Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra**
**Dashami Dasha**

**Mulaartha:** After a girl leaves childhood and matures in knowledge, entering youth, her parents give her to a suitable husband with a proper dowry. She becomes his wife. She is his beloved and cherished one. She is beautiful and charming like a box of jewels. When she goes inside and outside the house, many servants and maids accompany her, and they ask, "What do you desire?"

**Teeka:** When the girl leaves childhood and enters youth, becoming intelligent and knowledgeable, her parents, recognizing her as a young woman, give her to a young man of similar lineage and character, as his wife, with a proper dowry. From that day, she becomes his wife. She has no co-wife. She remains his beloved and cherished one. The rest of the description is clear in the Mulaartha.

The phrase "Padiruven Sukkenam Padiruvasa Bhattaraasa" in the Sutra means: "With a suitable form, at the time of the hand-holding ceremony, with a dowry (Shulka), given to a suitable husband (Bhatra) who is equal in form, age, and other qualities."

Now the Sutrakar describes the effect of this karma on her Dharma:

"Tise Nam Tahapagaraye Itthiyae Taharuve Samane Mahane Va Ubhaye-Kalem Kevali-Pannattam Dhamma Aikkhejjya? Hanta! Aikkhejjya, Sa Nam Bhanta! Padisunejja No Indhe Samadhe, Abhaviya Nam Sa Tassa Dhammas Saavanayae, Sa Cha Bhavati Mahiccha, Maharambha, Maha-Pariggaha Ahhammiya Jav Dahinagamie Neraiye"

**Translation:** "Will this woman, who has entered this household, attain the perfect Dharma, both in this life and the next, by associating with a monk or a Brahmin? Yes, she will. She will not hear the teachings of the Indha and Samadha. She will be devoted to the Dharma. She will be full of desires, ambitions, and attachments, and will be caught in the cycle of rebirth."

A rare-knowledge-possessing woman becomes. Thus, O monks! The cause of this is that, in the division of the fruits of the karmas, she is not able to listen to the Dharma, which is only declared by the Kevalis.

Would a monk or a layman, in this way, declare the Dharma, which is only declared by the Kevalis, to such a woman? Yes! He would declare it. But, O venerable one! This meaning is not possible. She is not fit to listen to this Dharma. She is full of great desires, great undertakings, great attachments, and is unrighteous. As long as she is inclined towards the south, she will be a hell-bound being and will also be a rare-knowledge-possessing woman. Thus, O monks! The cause of this is that, in the division of the fruits of the karmas, she is not able to listen to the Dharma, which is only declared by the Kevalis.

**Original meaning:**

Would a monk or a layman, in this way, declare the Dharma, which is only declared by the Kevalis, to such a woman? Yes! He would declare it. But, she is not fit to listen to this Dharma. She is full of great desires, great undertakings, great attachments, and is unrighteous. As long as she is inclined towards the south, she will be a hell-bound being and will also be a rare-knowledge-possessing woman. Thus, the cause of this is that, in the division of the fruits of the karmas, she is not able to listen to the Dharma, which is only declared by the Kevalis.

Page #468:
---------------------------
Here is the English translation, preserving the Jain terms:

The Dashashruta-skandha-sutra

The woman who engages in Nigrantha (non-ascetic) conduct, unrighteous, dakshinagamini (going to the southern realm, i.e. hell), and accumulates inauspicious-bodhi (enlightenment-obstructing) karma for the future, loses even the ability to listen to the Dharma spoken by the Kevalin (omniscient being). O Ayushman (venerable) Shramana (ascetic)! This is the sinful fruit and result of the Nidana (karmic impulse) karma.

Tenth Stage

Commentary - This sutra describes the fruit of the Nidana karma committed by the Nirgrantha (non-ascetic). She who commits Nidana karma cannot become attentive to listen to the Dharma even when she encounters a Shramana or Shravaka (lay follower), because her soul has turned away from Dharma-shravan (listening to the Dharma) and is only running towards sensual pleasures. Her resolutions remain engrossed in Mahagraha (great attachment) and Mahaparigrah (great possessiveness). As a result, she accumulates inauspicious-bodhi karma for the future. After death, she becomes a dakshinagamini (going to the southern realm, i.e. hell) Narakini (hell-being). All this is the fruit of that Nidana karma driven by lust. Therefore, Nidana karma is to be completely abandoned.

Now the sutra-author speaks about the third Nidana karma:

"O Ayushman Shramana! Thus, I have expounded the Dharma. This very Nigrantha (non-ascetic) preaching goes on till the end. Whomever the Nigrantha, established in the learning of that Dharma, sees a woman with the desire of the past, and as he proceeds, sees that woman becoming one after another, up to 'what does it taste to your mouth?' - having seen this, the Nigrantha commits Nidana (karmic impulse)."

Page #469:
---------------------------
## Dashami Dasha
**With Hindi Commentary**

**Sikkhae** -  Having arisen for the sake of education, **vihar-mane** - wandering, **nigganth** - liberated, **pura diginchhae** - with previous hunger, **jav** - as long as the desire for worldly pleasures arises, **parakkammane** -  being valiant, **pasejja** - sees, **ima** - this, **itthia** - woman, **bhavathi** - is, **ega** - one, **egg-jaya** - without a co-wife (and surrounded by servants), **jav** - as long as those servants are in prayer, **te** - your, **asagass** - mouth, **kin** - what, **sadati** - pleases. **Jan** - seeing her, **nigganth** - liberated, **nidaan** - karmic, **kareti** - does.

**401**

**Mulaarth** - O venerable ascetic! Thus I have expounded the Dharma. This liberated discourse destroys all suffering. The liberated one, having arisen for the sake of education, wanders, enduring previous hunger and other trials with fortitude, and sees a woman who alone enjoys the wealth of her home, without a co-wife. Her servants and maidservants constantly pray, "What pleases your mouth?" Seeing her, the liberated one performs karmic action.

**Tika** - This sutra also describes the previous narrative in a transformed way. The Lord says, "O venerable ascetic! I have described the Dharma in the form of scripture and conduct. If the liberated one, having arisen for the sake of education, endures trials and sees a woman laden with merit and therefore experiencing all worldly pleasures, surrounded by servants and maidservants, where four or five servants appear without being called when one is summoned, and who wait for the command from her mouth, who is the beloved of her husband and is seen by him to be properly cared for, the liberated one performs karmic action."

Now the sutra-maker describes the subject of this karmic action:

**Dukkha khalu pumatta je ime uggaputta maha-mauyya bhogaputta maha-mauyya etesin nan annatresu uchavaesu maha-samarasangamesu**

Mulartha-In the world, manhood is, certainly, painful. Those who are fierce-sons, great-mothers, and pleasure-sons, great-mothers, they have to be pierced by small or big weapons in some big or small great war. Therefore, manhood is painful, womanhood is good. If there is a special fruit of tapas, rule, and Brahmacharya-residence, then we will also enjoy such excellent women-enjoyments in the future. This is right.

Page #471:
---------------------------
## Tenth Decad
**With Hindi Commentary**

It is a great hardship to be a man, and it is most excellent to be a woman. If there is any special fruit of this austerity, rules, and celibacy, then we will also wander in the future, enjoying the pleasures of such principal women. This is our best thought.

**Commentary:** This sutra shows how the Nirgrantha performs the third nidana-karma. When the Nirgrantha sees the previously described woman, he begins to think in his mind that it is undoubtedly difficult to be a man in the world, because a man has to endure many hardships in battles fought by many great men and low-born Bhilla-Kiratas, being pierced by high weapons like cannons and low weapons like stones. Therefore, it is better to be a woman, because she does not have to go to any battle. If there is any special fruit of our austerity, rules, and celibacy, then we will also enjoy the pleasures related to women in the next birth, because womanhood is excellent.

**403**

Now the sutra-maker, keeping in mind the same subject, says:

Thus, O Shraman! Ayushman! The Nirgrantha, having performed the nidana, without considering that place (then), without returning, without accepting, having spent time for a period of months, becomes a deity in one of the heavenly realms. He then becomes a god there, a great giver, as long as he lives. He then, from that heavenly realm, due to the exhaustion of his lifespan, due to the exhaustion of his existence, having abandoned that state, returns to another family as a poor woman.

Page #472:

Dashami Dasha
Original meaning: - O Ayushman Shraman! Thus, by doing Nirgrantha Nidana-karma and at that time without consulting the Guru about it, without retreating from it and without accepting your fault or without taking atonement, at the time of death, making time, you are born in some one Deva-loka in the form of a Deva. There, he wanders among the Devas as a wealthy Deva. Thereafter, due to the exhaustion of his lifespan and Deva-bhavana, he leaves the Deva-body without any interval and is born in some one Kula in the form of a daughter.
Commentary: - The Sadhu who has done the Nidana-karma of womanhood, if he does not retreat from it, then he goes to the Deva-loka after death. When his Deva-loka lifespan karma is exhausted, then he is born in some one noble Kula of the human world in the form of a daughter. The rest is all clear:

The Sutrakar then speaks on the same subject:
Jav Tenam Tam Dariyam Jav Bharayattae Dalayati. Sa Nam Tassa Bharia Bhavati Ega Egajaya Jav Taheva Savvam Bhaniyavvam.

**With Hindi Commentary**

Because she is unfit to listen to the Dharma. She becomes filled with intense desires and becomes a Narakini (hell-bound being) destined for the South direction, accumulating rare-knowledge karmas in the future. O Ayushman Shraman! This is the kind of result of the Nidana-karma, a sinful fruit-ripening, which even takes away the ability to listen to the Dharma spoken by the Kevali.

**Commentary:** The meaning of this Sutra is similar to the last Sutra on Nidana-karma. By performing Nidana-karma, a Nirgrantha woman becomes entangled, and she cannot even listen to the Dharma, because due to being caught in the enjoyment of pleasures, her Bodhi-karma becomes rare. As a result, she is born in hell. Therefore, a Nirgrantha who desires the well-being of his soul should not even mistakenly perform Nidana-karma. It is completely to be abandoned. The rest is all easy.

Now the Sutrakar describes the fourth Nidana-karma:

"Thus, O Shraman! Ayushman! I have declared the Dharma, this very Nirgrantha preaching is true, the rest also, and it continues until the end. For whom, of the Dharma, the Nirgrantha, dwelling in the presence of learning, formerly with the desire for knowledge, formerly until the arisen-desire-born,..."

And she should wander. And she should exert herself. And while exerting herself, she should see that these Ugra-putra Maha-matrika, Bhog-putra Maha-matrika, from among them, when one is going in or out of the house, what does he like to eat? Seeing him, the Nirgranthi performs the Nidan-karma.
Pada-artha-anvaya-Samana-Uaso-O Ayushman! Shraman! Mae-I have thus, for sure, in Dhamme-Dharma, pannatte-explained.

Mula-artha-O Ayushman! Shraman! I have thus explained Dharma. This Nirgrantha-pravacana is truth (the rest of the description should be known as before) and it is the one that ends all suffering. For the sake of learning this Dharma, the Nirgranthi, having come and wandering, from previous hunger, becomes desire-lustful and wanders, and then exerts herself in restraint. And while exerting herself, she sees that these Ugra and Bhog families' Maha-matrika sons, from among them, when one is going in or out of the house (the servants pray that what does your mouth like), seeing them, the Nirgranthi performs the Nidan-karma.

## The Tenth Chapter

**With Hindi Commentary**

**Question:** How does a Nirgranthi (a liberated soul) perform karma-removal simply by seeing those men?

**Answer:** The Sutrakar (author of the sutras) himself says: "Indeed, womanhood is suffering, because it is difficult for women to travel from one village to another, or from one encampment to another. Just as the flesh of a mango, or the flesh of an Amratak (a fruit with many seeds), or the flesh of meat, or the fruit of a Salmali tree, are desirable, sought after, and coveted by many people, so too are women desirable, sought after, and coveted by many people. Therefore, womanhood is suffering, and manhood is good."

**Word-by-word meaning:**

* Itthi-ttana-e - Womanhood
* Dukkha-m khlu - Indeed, suffering
* Ga-mantara-i - From one village to another
* San-nivesa-antara-i - From one encampment to another
* Dura-sanchara-i-n - It is difficult to travel
* Se jaha na-ma-e - Just as
* Amba-pesia-ti - The flesh of a mango
* Amba-dag-pesia-ti - The flesh of an Amratak
* Mans-pesia-ti - The flesh of meat
* Sanbali-phalia-ti - The fruit of a Salmali tree
* Bahu-janas-sa - For many people
* Asa-yana-ijja - Desirable
* Patthana-ijja - Sought after
* Pihana-ijja - Coveted
* Abhilas-ana-ijja - Desired
* Eva-mev - Similarly
* Itthi-ka-pi - Women too
* Bahu-janas-sa - For many people
* Asa-yana-ijja - Desirable
* Abhilas-ana-ijja - Desired
* Ta-m - Therefore
* Itthi-ttana-e - Womanhood

Dasa-śruta-skandha-sūtra
I
The essence - Being a woman in the worldly life is extremely painful, because it is very difficult for women to come and go from one village to another and from one halt to another. Just as the branch of a mango, the branch of a citron (bījōrē), the branch of an āmrātaka (a multi-seeded fruit), the branch of meat, the shoot of sugarcane, and the pod of the śālmalī tree are very desirable, sought after, and longed for by many men, similarly, women too are very desirable and longed for by many men. Therefore, womanhood is certainly a form of suffering, and manhood is virtuous.
Tenth stage
Commentary - In this sūtra, the cause of the karma of the ascetic (nirgrantha) is explained. The ascetic woman reflects on seeing the male ascetics that being a woman in the worldly life is very bad, because it is very difficult for her to go from one place to another. The reason is that just as a carnivorous bird swoops down on a piece of meat upon seeing it, desiring to obtain it, and just as people's mouths water upon seeing delicious fruits like mangoes, citrons (bījōrē), the fruit of the śālmalī tree, and the shoot of sugarcane, and they develop an intense desire to obtain them, similarly, many wicked men also become greedy upon seeing a woman and start looking at her with an evil eye, due to which the woman is always in fear of protecting her chastity, and therefore, it becomes very difficult for her to move around freely. Therefore, womanhood is a form of suffering, and manhood is virtuous. Men can go anywhere with complete freedom and fearlessness. They do not face any obstacles like women do.

Now the author, relating to the above topic, says:

"If there is this rule of yours, then we too will enjoy partaking of such gross sensual pleasures of men."  This is not virtuous.

Thus, O Shraman! O Ayushman! Having made the Nirgranthi nidana, without discussing it with the Guru, without turning back, and without taking pratyakshya, he spends time in the death month, and is born as a deity in one of the deva-lokas. He becomes a deity there, with great wealth and great happiness. Then, from that deva-loka, after the exhaustion of his lifespan, he abandons that body and is born as a son of an Ugraputra, or even as a Dārakā, depending on what pleases your mouth. Such a man, born in this way, is incapable of hearing the Dharma. He becomes one with great desires, destined for the southern hell, and difficult to attain enlightenment in the next life. Thus, he is unable to even listen to the Dharma of the Kevali.

## Dashami Dasha (with Hindi Commentary)

**Original Meaning:**  O Venerable Ascetic!  By performing the **nirgranthi** (free from knots) **nidana-karma** (karma of the past) in this way, and without questioning it, without retreating from it, and without accepting atonement, at the time of death, she enters a particular **dev-lok** (heavenly realm) and is born as a **dev** (god) with great wealth and happiness.  Then, due to the exhaustion of her lifespan in that **dev-lok**, without any interval, she leaves her divine body and is born as a child in the lineage of the **Ugra-putra** (fierce sons).  Servants ask her, "What do you desire?"  Such a person is incapable of listening to the **kevali-bhashit dharma** (the teachings of the omniscient).  However, she is full of desires, a **dakshinagami nairyik** (one who goes towards the south, a type of hell), and earns the **durbhalam bodhik karma** (karma that hinders enlightenment).  Thus, O Venerable Ascetic! She cannot even hear the **kevali-pratipadit dharma** (the teachings of the omniscient).

**Commentary:**  In this sutra, the description is similar to the previous one.  When she performs the **nirgranthi** **nidana-karma** in the aforementioned way and does not question it, after death, she is born as a **dev** in a particular **dev-lok**.  Then, due to the exhaustion of her lifespan, she is born as a child in the lineage of the **Ugra** etc. in the human realm.  There, she is so engrossed in wealth that she does not have the capacity to even listen to the **kevali-pratipadit dharma**.  Worldly desires blind her to the path of dharma.

Now, the sutra-kar (author of the sutra) speaks about the fifth **nidana-karma**.

Thus, O Venerable Ascetic! In this dharma, I have declared that a **niggantha** (Jain ascetic) who is practicing the **sikha** (discipline) and is dwelling in the **pura-dig-ichcha** (desire for the four directions), as long as she dwells in **udinna-kama-bhoga** (intense desires and pleasures), she will be reborn in the **parakkama** (higher realms).  And while she is dwelling in the **parakkama**, she will be reborn in the **manussaga** (human realm) and will be consumed by **kama-bhoga** (desires and pleasures).  The human realm is...

Dashashruta-skandha-sutra
Tenth Dasa
The sensual pleasures (kama-bhoga) are impermanent, unstable, and subject to destruction and decay. They are characterized by the arising of excreta, urine, phlegm, saliva, mucus, wind, bile, and semen. They are associated with difficult inhalation and exhalation, and are filled with endless urine and feces. They are associated with vomiting, bile, and phlegm. One must certainly renounce them, both in the past and in the future.

Thus, O ascetic! I have indeed expounded the Dharma. This is the true Nirgrantha (Jain) doctrine. Whoever, for the sake of learning the Dharma, whether Nirgranthi or Nirgranthini, dwells, prior to the arising of sensual pleasures, until the arising of sensual pleasures is over, and then makes effort, and in making effort, attains dispassion towards human sensual pleasures - for, verily, human sensual pleasures are impermanent, unstable, and subject to destruction and decay. They are characterized by the arising of excreta, urine, phlegm, saliva, mucus, wind, bile, and semen. They are associated with difficult inhalation and exhalation, and are filled with endless urine and feces. They are associated with vomiting, bile, and phlegm. One must certainly renounce them, both in the past and in the future.

## Dashami Dasha
**With Hindi Commentary**

Those who are born from the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, and ether) are filled with impurities. They are born from **vat**, **pitta**, **sukk**, **shukra**, and **soniya** (blood). They have **duruv** (foul) **ussas** (exhalation) and **nissasa** (inhalation). They are filled with **mutt** (urine) and **puris** (feces). They are the **vantaasava** (doorway for vomiting) and **pittaasava** (doorway for bile). **Khelaasava** (phlegm) also flows from them. After death, or before old age, they must be abandoned.

**Original Meaning:**

O **Ayushman** (venerable one), O **Shraman** (ascetic)! This is how I have explained the Dharma. This is the **nirgrantha** (unbound) discourse, the truth, and the destroyer of all suffering. The **nirgrantha** (or **nirgranthi**) who, while seeking this Dharma, experiences the arising of **bhubhukhsa** (hunger) and other desires, yet remains steadfast in the path of **samyama** (self-restraint), attains **vairagya** (dispassion) towards worldly desires. For they are **aniyat** (uncertain), **anity** (impermanent), and **kshanik** (fleeting). Their decay, corruption, and destruction are their Dharma. The human body, the foundation of these desires, is made of **vishta** (feces), **mutra** (urine), **shleeshma** (phlegm), **mal** (impurities), **nasika ka mal** (nasal discharge), **vaman** (vomit), **pitta** (bile), **shukra** (semen), and **soniya** (blood). It is filled with foul exhalations and inhalations. It is full of foul-smelling urine and feces. It is the doorway for vomiting. Bile and phlegm constantly flow from it. It must be abandoned after death or before old age.

**Commentary:**

This sutra highlights that **nirgrantha** and **nirgranthi** have experienced the impermanence of worldly desires and the human body, and have developed dispassion towards them. When desires arise, they reflect that worldly desires and the body that supports them are impermanent, fleeting, and destined for destruction. Decay, corruption, and destruction are their natural Dharma. It is made of impurities, urine, phlegm, semen, and blood. Foul-smelling exhalations and inhalations constantly emanate from it. It is always full of urine and feces. It is the doorway for vomiting. Phlegm and bile constantly flow from it. It must be abandoned completely, whether after death or before old age.

Or give it up before old age, because it is impermanent, so it is good to give it up. The point is that they considered that human enjoyment and the human body are certainly hateful, therefore they are to be abandoned.
Now the Sutrakar says, what did they consider next?

Tenth Dasha
There are gods above in the heaven-world, they there enjoy the wives of other gods, they enjoy and serve them. They also make themselves beautiful, they make themselves beautiful and serve them. They enjoy their own wives, they enjoy and serve them. If there are fruits of this your rule of austerity, then all that should be said, until we also come to enjoy such heavenly pleasures. That is good.

Word-by-word meaning: Uddha - above, Devalokansi - in the heaven-world, Deva Deva Santi - there are gods, Te Nan - those gods, Tattha - there, Annesim - other, Devanam - of gods, Deviyo - wives, Abhijunjiy - they subdue, Abhijunjiy (i)tta - having subdued, Pariyarent - they make them enjoy. Other gods, Appano Cheva - their own, Appaanam - soul, Viuvviy - they make beautiful, Viuvviy (i)tta - having made beautiful, Pariyarent - they make them enjoy. Other gods, Appanijjiyao - their own, Deviyo - wives, Abhijunjiy - they subdue, Abhijunjiy (i)tta - having subdued, Pariyarent - they make them enjoy.

Eyaruvaim-Such divine, god-related enjoyments-pleasures-that which is to be enjoyed, while enjoying-indulging in them, we wander-roam around. Se tam-This is the best of the sadhus-the excellent.
Malartha-In the upper divine realms, there are devas (gods). Among them, some subjugate the goddesses of other devas and engage them in enjoyment, others create a vaikriya (transformed) form from their own self and engage them in enjoyment, and still others enjoy their own goddesses. So, if there is any special fruit of this tapas (austerity), penance, and discipline, then we too shall wander in the future, enjoying such god-related enjoyments. This is our most excellent thought. The rest of the description should be known as before ('yavat' word has occurred many times, which indicates the previous description).
Tika-This sutra describes the topic of the company (sexual play) of the devas. Some deities subjugate the goddesses of other devas and, having subdued them, incite them for sexual intercourse. Others, by transforming their own self, that is, by the vikuryana (transformation) of the goddess, engage in sexual intercourse with her. The commentator explains this as follows - "Atmanaivātmānaṃ strīpuruṣarūpatayā vikṛtyetyarthaḥ" - that is, they transform their own self into two different forms, female and male, and engage in sexual activity. However, in the 'Bhagavati' sutra, it is written that a single living being cannot experience the desires for the enjoyment of both the female and male at the same time. So, the established tradition in this matter is that the male deities transform their male organ, and their own goddesses transform into the female form, and in this way, they engage in mutual sexual enjoyment. This truth is well-known to the learned. There are some devas who remain satisfied by enjoying with their own goddesses.
Seeing the voluntary joyful sport of the devas in this way, the thought arose in the minds of the Nirgrantha (Jain ascetics) and Nirgranthinīs (Jain nuns) that the devas alone are blessed. Therefore, if there is any special fruit of our this tapas (austerity), penance, and discipline, then we too shall wander in the future, enjoying these three types of sexual play related to the devas.

Now the Sutra-kar, keeping in relation to the said subject, says:

Thus, O Shramanas! A Nirgrantha, having performed the Nidana, without considering the place, without turning back, having made time, is born as a deity in one of the Deva-lokas. For example, among the Mahiddhish, the Mahadyutik, he wanders, shining, and attends to the other Devas and the other Devis, as before. Then, from that Deva-loka, due to the exhaustion of his lifespan, he returns to the state of a human being, and what does he taste of the Asya?

Mula-artha - O Ayushman! Shramana! Having done the Nidana karma in this way, without criticizing the Nirgrantha or Nirgranthi at that very moment, and without withdrawing from him, at the time of death, having done the kala, he is born as a deva in one of the deva-lokas. There, shining among the great, majestic and radiant devas, he roams about, enjoying the company of the devis of those devas in the aforementioned three ways. Then, due to the exhaustion of the deva-loka life, he is born again in the human form, and the slaves and slave-girls pray, "What pleases your mouth?"
Tika - Just as in the earlier and second Nidana-karmas, the Nirgrantha and Nirgranthi had expressed the desire to be born in families with longevity etc., and they had also obtained the corresponding fruits, similarly here they had desired to be born in the deva-loka and experience the divine pleasures, and accordingly they obtained the enjoyment of the three types of devis in the deva-loka. When their meritorious karmas were consumed by the fire of enjoyment, they came to the human world and obtained the aforementioned worldly pleasures of the kumara-s. The rest of the description is as before.

Now the Sutrakara says, what is the effect of doing the Nidana karma on the path of dharma:
"Tassa nam taha-ppagaarassa purisa-jaatassa taha-ruve samane va maahane va jaava padi-sunijja? Hanta! Padi-sunijja se nam saddahejja pattijejja roejja no tinnatte samatte. Abhavie-nam se tassa saddahantaae. Se ya bhavati mahicche jaava daahina-gaamiraye aagamesaana dullabha-bodhie yavi bhavati."

A Samana (monk) or a Mahana (layman) who has this kind of nidana (karma) will hear the Dharma, but he will not be able to believe it, accept it, or find it pleasing.
This is because he is not capable of believing in the Dharma. He will be a Mahichcha (one with great desires) and will become a Dakshinagami (one who goes to hell) and will be a Durlabha Bodhi (one who is difficult to awaken).
This is the kind of papa (sinful) phala-vipaka (fruit of karma) that results from this kind of nidana. It is impossible for someone with this kind of karma to believe, accept, or find pleasure in the Dharma.

It is not possible for him to have faith, belief, and interest in it, because due to the influence of Nidana-karma, he becomes incapable of having faith. He becomes full of great desires and as a result, becomes a south-bound hell-bound being and in future births, he becomes a rare-knower. O Ayushman! Shraman! The fruit-result of that Nidana-karma is such that it makes him incapable of having the power of faith, belief, and interest in the Dharma spoken by the Kevali Bhagwan.

**Commentary:** This Sutra states that the person who performs Nidana-karma loses all his spiritual powers. He does not even have the power to have faith in the Dharma spoken by the Kevali. Due to the influence of Nidana-karma, the atoms of Maha Mohaniya Karma start to arise in his soul, which do not allow faith and belief in Dharma to arise. Therefore, it is beneficial for the Arya Purushas to abandon that karma.

Now the Sutrakar describes the sixth Nidana Karma: _"Even so, O Shraman! Ayushman! The Dharma has been declared by me - and that too, he should strive for it.

A person should become dispassionate towards sensual pleasures in the human realm; for sensual pleasures in the human realm are impermanent and fleeting. Similarly, even the gods in the heavenly realms do not enjoy the wives of other gods. They enjoy their own selves, transforming themselves into both male and female forms. If this is the fruit of austerities and vows, then why should anyone have faith, belief, or interest in this path?

Word-by-word meaning:
O Ayushman! O Shraman! Thus, I have expounded the Dharma. The rest of the explanation is similar to the previous Sutras. He should strive in the path of restraint and while striving, he should become dispassionate towards sensual pleasures in the human realm, because sensual pleasures in the human realm are impermanent and fleeting. Similarly, even the gods in the heavenly realms do not enjoy the wives of other gods. They enjoy their own selves, transforming themselves into both male and female forms. If this is the fruit of austerities and vows, then why should anyone have faith, belief, or interest in this path?

## Dashami Dasha
**With Hindi Commentary**

They do not engage in [sexual] acts with others, but from their own soul, they assume the forms of different gods and goddesses and engage in love-play, or they subdue their own goddesses and engage them in sensual pleasures. If all these austerities and rules are as before, it is not possible for that person to have faith, belief, and interest in the Kevali-proclaimed Dharma, meaning they cannot have faith, etc., in the Dharma.

**Commentary:** This sutra states that the person who performs the Nidana Karma thought in their mind, "In the realm of gods, there are gods who do not engage in love-play with the goddesses of others, but from their own soul, they create two different forms of gods and goddesses and engage in mutual enjoyment, or they are content with enjoying their own goddesses. If my austerities and rules have any fruit, then I too will become a god who engages in both types of love-play." Due to the influence of those austerities, etc., they become that type of god. When their divine karma is exhausted, they are reborn in the mortal realm, either in a fierce or pleasure-seeking family, as a son. There, they get all the materials for worldly enjoyment, and getting caught in them, they cannot have faith, belief, and interest in the Kevali-proclaimed Dharma, because due to the influence of that karma, the mohaniya karma arises strongly in their mind, causing the feeling of Dharma to disappear from their mind.

This is the fruit of the Nidana Karma that they do not have faith in Jain Dharma. The question arises, can they have faith in any other Dharma? The sutra-maker himself answers:

**"They become like others. Those who go to the Aranya, the Avasahya, the Gama, the Kanhu, the Rahasya, the No Bahu-Sanjaya, the No Bahu-Virya, in all beings, in all living beings, they say to themselves, 'I am not to be killed, others are to be killed. I am not to be oppressed, others are to be oppressed. I am not to be deceived, others are to be deceived."**

I am not to be taken, others are to be taken. I am not to be harassed, others are to be harassed. In the same way, those who are infatuated with women, bound, greedy, and have fallen into the state of Asuras, remain in the state of Asuras for a long time. Then, when they are released, they return to the state of being mute. Thus, O Shraman! O Ayushman! As long as one is unable to believe in the perfectly declared Dharma, he is like those who are infatuated with other doctrines.

He who has a taste for other doctrines, has only a taste for them. And those who live in the forest, in huts, in villages, or in secret places, who are not well-controlled, who are not well-restrained, who contradict the truth about themselves in all living beings, creatures, and beings, are like those who say, "I am not to be killed, others are to be killed. I am not to be commanded, others are to be commanded. I am not to be tormented, others are to be tormented. I am not to be taken, others are to be taken. I am not to be harassed, others are to be harassed."

## The Tenth Decad

**With Hindi Commentary**

They place their faults on others and say, "Do not kill me, kill others; do not command me, command others; do not harm me, harm others; do not capture me, capture others; do not hurt me, hurt others." Those who have not renounced *prāṇātipāta* (violence against living beings), *mṛṣāpāda* (false speech), and *adattādāna* (taking what is not given), and who are *mucchiyā* (deluded), *gaḍhiyā* (bound), *giddha* (greedy), and *ajjhovvaṇṇā* (intensely attached or immersed) in *itthikāmehiṃstrī-sambandhī kāma-bhogā* (worldly pleasures related to women), at the time of death, *kālaṃ kicchā* (struggle with death), are born in the realms of *aṇṇa-tarāī-asurāiṃ* (Asuras, demonic beings) or *kibbisīyāiṃ* (Kilibisas, a class of low-grade gods). After that, they are released from that place and are born again as *muyyattāe* (sheep-like, unclear speakers) or *gūṅge* (mute).

**O Āyusmān! O Śramaṇa!** Thus, it is certain that the *niḍāṇa* (cause) of this *karma* (action) is such that the person who performs it does not have the *saddahīe* (faith or belief) or *ruci* (interest) in the *kevali-paṇṇattā-kevali-bhāṣitā-dhamma* (the true Dharma spoken by the Kevalis).

**Original Meaning:**

He has an interest in other philosophies than Jainism. Due to this interest, he becomes like those forest-dwelling ascetics, those who live in leaf huts, those who live near villages, and those who perform secret acts. They are not *bahu-saṃyata* (highly restrained), not *bahu-virata* (highly renounced), and have not completely renounced violence against all beings, ghosts, living beings, and creatures. They use a language mixed with truth and falsehood and blame others for their faults, saying, "Do not kill me, kill others; do not command me, command others; do not harm me, harm others; do not capture me, capture others; do not hurt me, hurt others."

Page #494:
---------------------------
##  The Tenth Dasha of the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha Sutra

They remain engaged in violence, falsehood, and non-giving, and along with these, they are intoxicated, bound, greedy, and extremely attached to sensual pleasures related to women. At the time of death, they are born in the realms of Asura-Kumaras or Kilbisha-Devas. Then, escaping from those realms, they are repeatedly born in the mortal realm as mute (inarticulate or dumb) like sheep. O Ayushman! Shraman! The result of that karmic seed is that the doer cannot have faith, belief, or interest in the Dharma expounded by the Kevali Bhagavan, meaning they do not have the capacity to have faith in the right Dharma.

**Commentary:** This Sutra states that once a person performs the karmic seed, when they return to the mortal realm, they cannot develop an interest in the principles of Jainism. Instead, their interest lies in other philosophies. Based on the extent of that interest, they become like the following types of ascetics:

* **Kanda-Muladi-Bhakṣi Aranya-Vasi Tapas:** Forest-dwelling ascetics who eat roots and tubers.
* **Kutiya Banakar Van Mein Rahne Wale Tapas:** Ascetics who live in huts in the forest.
* **Gram Ke Sameep Rahne Wale Tapas:** Ascetics who live near villages.
* **Gupt-Kary Karne Wale Tapas:** Ascetics who perform secret acts.

These ascetics are inherently unrestrained in their conduct but are not truly restrained in their actions without right faith. They are not completely free from violence towards beings, creatures, living beings, and entities. They repeatedly preach mixed-up language and speak in a way that is full of sin and faults. For example, they say:

* "I am a Brahmin, so do not kill me. This punishment is for Shudras and others, it should be given to them."
* "Their sin is removed simply by Pranayama."
* "Even if sin has filled their bones due to killing small creatures, it is removed simply by feeding Brahmins."

Similarly, they say:

* "Do not give me any orders, give orders to others."
* "Do not torment me, torment others."
* "Do not catch me, catch others."
* "Do not cause me pain, cause pain to others."

In this way, those who remain engaged in violence, falsehood, non-giving, or theft, and along with these, are intoxicated, bound, greedy, and extremely attached to sensual pleasures related to women, their...

## The Tenth Dasha

**With Hindi Commentary**

Those who are deeply attached to the pleasures of the heavenly realms, either before or after taking the vows of a monk (accepting mendicancy), are born as Asura-Kumaras or Kilbisha-Devas due to their ignorance. After death, they are reborn in the human realm as mute or unclear speakers, like sheep. They continue to wander in the endless cycle of birth and death for an eternity. Therefore, the revered Shraman Bhagwan Mahavir Swami says, "O Ayushmans! O Shramans! This is the result of the Nidana Karma, which leads to the loss of faith in the Kevali-Bhashit Dharma. Therefore, this Karma must be completely abandoned."

**427**

Although many people who follow other Tirthika (non-Jain) doctrines believe that it is better to become a monk in their previous life after experiencing worldly pleasures, their vows are born out of ignorance and generate Kashayas (passions). This is why their actions are described as above.

It is important to note that if these six Nidana Karmas are performed in this specific order, they will hinder the attainment of Samyaktva (right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct). However, if they are performed in a different order, they will not pose any obstacle to achieving Samyaktva, as is evident in the case of Draupadi and others. Similarly, if someone performs this Nidana Karma with the intention of becoming wealthy in another life, they can attain Samyaktva after becoming wealthy. However, in all these cases, the intention of the mind plays a crucial role. The same applies to the case of Krishna Shrenik.

The essence of this statement is that those who perform Nidana Karma with attachment to worldly pleasures will face obstacles in attaining Samyaktva, while others will not.

Now, the Sutrakar describes the seventh Nidana Karma in the order of its occurrence:

"Thus, O Shramans! It is stated in the Dharma: Just as there are worldly pleasures in the human realm, so too, there are Devas (gods) in the heavenly realms. These Devas do not enjoy each other, nor do they enjoy themselves. They are not self-indulgent."

Page #496:
---------------------------
The translation preserving the Jain terms is as follows:

The Dashashruta-skandha-sutra
The Tenth Dasa

The devis (divine beings) are mutually embracing and enjoying each other. There are the tapa-niyamas (austerities and vows) for them, all of which are the same. Yavat, O Shramana! Ayushman! (Venerable ascetic!) I have expounded the dharma. Just as the human beings' kama-bhogas (sensual pleasures) are anitya (impermanent), so it is. There are the devas (divine beings) in the deva-lokas (celestial realms) above. The devas do not embrace and enjoy other devis (divine beings), but they embrace and enjoy their own devis. There are the tapa-niyamas (austerities and vows) for them, all of which are the same. Yavat, O Shramana! Ayushman! (Venerable ascetic!) the Nirgranthas (Jain ascetics) or Nirgranthi (Jain ascetics) having made the nidana (resolution), without considering that state, and without retreating from it, abide in that state.

Page #497:
---------------------------
O ascetic! Thus have I expounded the doctrine. As long as the sensual pleasures of human beings are uncertain, the rest remains as before. The devas in the upper celestial realms do not engage in sensual pleasures with the consorts of other devas, nor do they engage in sexual intercourse with the consorts manifested by their own spiritual powers, but they subjugate their own consorts and engage them in sexual intercourse. If there is any fruit of this vow of asceticism and the like, then I too shall become one who engages in sensual pleasures with my own deva-consort in the celestial realm. He becomes a deva in accordance with this mental disposition, and so on, all of which should be understood as before.

O ascetic! The houseless or the houseless nun, having made such a determination, without criticizing it at that very place and without receding from it, attains the state of a deva after the lapse of a month, and then enjoys the divine sensual pleasures, and so on, all of which should be understood as before.

The commentary states that in the seventh determination-karma, the houseless one had the resolve for only the third type of divine sensual pleasures. Due to not criticizing it at that very place and not performing the expiatory rites for it, he attains the state of a deva upon death, and then enjoys the aforementioned divine grandeur, and so on, all of which should be understood as before.

Now the author of the scripture, in relation to this, says:

He does not enjoy another deva's consort, nor does he enjoy his own consort manifested by his own spiritual powers, but he enjoys the consorts manifested by his own spiritual powers. He, due to the exhaustion of lifespan, the exhaustion of existence, the exhaustion of status - likewise it should be stated. However, he should have faith, should accept, should lament, he should undertake the vows of ethical conduct, vows, abstinence, renunciation, and the observance of the fortnightly fasts, not just superficially. He becomes a right-faith and right-knowledge ascetic.

Page #498:
---------------------------
Dasha-shruta-skandha-sutra

He does not engage in sexual relations with other deities' consorts, nor does he transform himself and engage in sexual relations with his own self. Rather, he engages in sexual relations with his own deity. Subsequently, due to the exhaustion of his lifespan, the destruction of his state of existence, and the destruction of his status, he is reborn in other lineages, as has been described earlier. However, it is desirable that he should have faith, conviction, and inclination. But he does not undertake the vows of conduct, the renunciation of qualities, the abjuration, the posadhopavasa (one-day and one-night fasts), and is therefore not capable of this. He becomes a darsana-shravaka (a lay follower who has faith and takes refuge in the Three Jewels).

Dashami Dasha
With Hindi Commentary.

**Kevali -** One who has faith, belief and interest in the spoken Dharma, but is unable to accept the vows of conduct, virtues, restraint, renunciation and fasting, etc. He becomes a Darshan Shravak.

**Commentary -** This Sutra describes the fruit of the seventh nidana-karma. Due to the aforementioned nidana-karma, he experiences happiness in the Nirgranth or Nirgranthi Deva-loka according to his own resolutions. He enjoys the aforementioned divine powers well. The rest of the description is the same as before, but the only difference is that he has faith, belief and interest in the Kevali-spoken Dharma, but he cannot accept the vows of conduct, virtues, restraint, renunciation and fasting, etc. on the eighth and other festival days. This fruit is obtained by him from the said nidana-karma that he remains only a Darshan Shravak, i.e. he is called a Darshan Shravak because of his expectation of attaining Samyaktva or because of his dependence on Samyaktva. In this regard, the Vrittikar writes, "Samyaktvaṁ tadāśritya śrāvako nigadyate", i.e. he is called a Darshan Shravak because of his dependence on Samyaktva.

Then the Sutrakar says in relation to this:

**Abhigat-jivajiva** yaavad asthimajjapremanuragarakto'yam, ayushman! Nirgranth-pravachano'rthaḥ paramārthaḥ śeṣo'narthaḥ. Sa nu etadrūpeṇa vihāreṇa viharan

**Abhigat-jivajiva** as long as he is attached to the marrow of the body, love and passion, O Ayushman! The meaning of the Nirgranth-pravachana is the ultimate truth, the rest is untruth. He, indeed, dwelling in this way,

Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
For many years, a Shramanopasaka observes the Paryaya. After observing it for many years, at the time of death, he attains the state of a deity in one of the Deva-lokas. Thus, O Ayushman! Shraman! This is the form of the sinful fruit-result of that cause, that he is unable to accept the Shila-vrata, Guna-vrata, and Poushadhopavasa.
The tenth Dasha
Word meaning - Abhigatajivajiva - who knows the Jiva and Ajiva, Jav- Yavat - as long as he is endowed with the qualities of a Shravaka, therefore Atthimijja - in his bones and marrow, Pemaanu-ragaste - he is attached with the love-attachment of Dharma, Auso, O Ayushman! Ayam - this Niggantha-Pavayana-Nirgrantha-Pravachanarupa Dharma is Atte - meaningful and true, Paramatte - this is the ultimate truth, Sese - the rest Anatte - is meaningless, i.e. false, Samsara - is the cause of growth, Se Nam - then he Etaruvena - in this way, Vihaarenam - by the conduct, Viharmane - wandering, Bahuin - for many Vasain - years, Samanopasaga - Shramanopasaka, Pariyagam - Paryaya, Paunai - observes, then Bahuin - for many Vasain - years, Pariyagam - Shramanopasaka's Paryaya, Paunitta - observing, Kalmaase - at the time of death, Kalam Kiccha - making time, Annatresu - in one of the Devaloaesu - Deva-lokas, Devattaa - in the form of a deity, Uvavattaro Bhavati - is born. Samanauaso - O Ayushman! Shraman! Evam Khalu - thus, Tassa - of that Nidanas - cause, Imeyaruve - this is the form of, Paave - sinful, Falavivaage - fruit-result, happens, Jan - from which, Silvavva - Shila-vrata, Gunavya - Guna-vrata, and Poshohovaasai - Poushadhopavasa, etc. Padivajjitte - to accept, Sanchati - power, does not remain, i.e. due to the influence of that cause-karma, the Shravaka does not have the power to observe the twelve vows, Nidana - karma, doing, in him, does not remain, but he remains a Darshan-Shravaka.

Original meaning - He knows the Jiva and Ajiva and is endowed with the qualities of a Shravaka, his bones and marrow are filled with the love of Dharma, O Ayushman! This Nirgrantha-Pravachan is the truth and the ultimate truth. The rest is meaningless. Wandering in this way, he observes the Paryayas of the Shramanopasaka for many years, and then, after observing that Paryaya, he makes time at the time of death and is born as a deity in one of the Deva-lokas.

Page #501:
---------------------------
## Dashami Dasha
**With Hindi Commentary**

**Translation:**

A person born in the realm of gods, in the form of a god, does not develop the capacity to embrace the virtues of *sheelavrat*, *gunavrat*, *viraman*, *pratyakhyan*, and *paushdhopavas* etc.

**Commentary:**

This sutra briefly describes the qualities of a Shravak. The Shravak who performs *nidan-karma* knows both the *jiva* and *ajiva*. Their bones and marrow are colored with the passion of Dharma. The oily substance between the bones is called marrow. This means that their very pores are filled with the love of Dharma. They have great faith and devotion in the words of Shri Bhagwan. Therefore, they see *nirgranth-pravachan* as the ultimate truth everywhere. They view all other worldly activities with disdain. In this way, they diligently follow the path of a *darshan-shravak* for many years and after death, they are born in the realm of gods. Shri Bhagwan says, "O Ayushman! O Shraman! Due to that *nidan-karma*, that Shravak cannot embrace the twelve vows. This is the result of their sinful actions." A detailed description of the Shravak path will be given in the section on the eighth *nidan-karma*. The commentator writes about this:

"Such a person, endowed with these qualities, diligently follows the path of a Shraman for many years. It is said that even a *kevala* is called a Shravak. Therefore, Bharat is also called a *darshan-shravak*, because this action is considered the most important." Bharat is also called a *darshan-shravak*. The rest of the explanation is straightforward.

Now, the sutrakar describes the eighth *nidan-karma*:

"O Samanau! Thus, I have explained the Dharma. This is the whole truth. When a person, while performing *parakkama*, is attracted to the sensual pleasures of the gods, they should not be tempted by the sensual pleasures of humans. Even if they are tempted by the sensual pleasures of the gods, they should not be tempted. These impermanent, non-permanent, fluctuating, and changing Dharmas will return again. They will definitely be tempted again in the future. There are many rules in this *tavaniyam*..."

Thus, O Shraman, O Ayushman, I have explained the Dharma, and all that is included in it. And that which leads to detachment from the pleasures of the gods and humans, those pleasures of humans are to be abandoned, and even the pleasures of the gods are impermanent, non-eternal, unstable, and subject to change, and they are to be abandoned. There are fruits of this practice of austerity and discipline, and in the future, whoever is born as a fierce son or a great mother, until they are reborn as a man, I will be a monk in their presence. Having understood the nature of living beings and non-living beings, and having attained the knowledge of good and bad karma, I will live by eating and drinking only what is wholesome and palatable, and by accepting only what is given.

With Hindi Commentary.

Samanovasae - Shramanopasak bhavisami - I will become a Shraman. Abhigata - Jivajive - Knowing the living and non-living, Uvaladdha - Punnapave - Obtaining merit and demerit, Jav-yavat fasuyessanijjan - Achitt and nirdosh asanan - food and water, khaiman - food and saiman - delicious food, padillabhemane - giving, viharassami - I will wander. This is my correct thought.

435
Original Meaning - O Ayushman! Shraman! In this way, I have explained the Dharma. You should know the rest as before. While striving in this Dharma, a Nirgranth or Nirgranthi should develop dispassion towards the worldly pleasures of Devas and humans, because the worldly pleasures of humans are impermanent, similarly, the worldly pleasures of Devas are also impermanent, uncertain, unpredictable, and perishable, and they are of fickle Dharma, i.e., unstable and come and go in sequence. They are definitely to be abandoned after death or before old age. If there is any special fruit of this penance and discipline, then in the future, I will be born in one of the Mahamatrik Umer, etc., clans in the form of a man, and I will become a Shramanopasak. Then, knowing the living, non-living, merit, and demerit, I will wander, giving food, water, food, and delicious food to the monks. This is my correct thought.

Commentary - In this Sutra, the eighth Nidana - Karma, which has been obtained in sequence, is described. Shri Bhagwan says that if a person, following the Dharma I have spoken, develops dispassion towards the worldly pleasures of humans and Devas in his mind, and he starts thinking in his mind that if I am born in the Ugra, etc., clans and become a Shramanopasak, then it is very good, because the Shramanopasak way of life is very good in my opinion. But I do not want to become a Shramanopasak in name only, but I want to possess all the qualities of a Shramanopasak.

Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
Tenth Dasha
-
It is only auspicious for me to become a Shraman Upasaka endowed with these qualities. I will become adept in the subjects of Jiva, Ajeeva, Punnya, Papa, Asrava, Sanvara, Nirjara, Kriya, Adhikarana, Bandha and Moksha, like other Shraman Upasakas, and I will not seek the help of even the Devas in the face of any adversity. May I attain such strength of self that I can produce everything for myself. This is also a quality of Shraman Upasakas, therefore the Vrittikara writes about this: "Ashahejeti" "Avidyamanam sahaaya-parashayakamatyantasamarthatvadhyasya sa ashayaha-apadypi devadisahayakanapeshah swayam kritam karma swayameva bhoktavyamityarthaha." Even when inspired by various types of Kutirthis, I will not deviate from Samyaktva and seek the help of others. The meaning is that just as other Shraman Upasakas are so steadfast in Samyaktva that even Devas cannot move them, so too will I be steadfast in it. Just as they are fearless, desireless and completely free from doubt in Nirgrantha-Pravachana, they know the essence of Nirgrantha-Pravachana, are familiar with its meaning, they confirm the meanings by being steadfast and by asking the Acharyas, and they decide the meanings through experience, just as their soul, body, bones, marrow and limbs are colored like the petals of a flower in the passion of Dharma, and they consider Nirgrantha Pravachana to be their goal and always preach that Nirgrantha Pravachana is the meaning and is the cause of liberation, therefore it is the ultimate truth, besides this, all the wealth, grain, family, etc. and other bad Pravachana (scriptures) in the world are all meaningless and cause meaninglessness, they keep their hearts pure like crystal, they always keep their doors open for giving alms to the monks, which proves their generosity and great giving (giving a lot of alms) - they are fearless, they enter the trusted families without any hindrance, they do not even step towards the untrusted families, and they observe the complete fasts on the fourteenth, eighth, new moon, full moon, etc. festival days, and they give the Shraman Nirgranthas lifeless and harmless food, water, Khadim, Swadim, clothes, blankets, dust removal, medicine, antidote, back-plank, bed, bedding and other things that the monks can accept, and they also take on tapasya-karma as much as they can, in the same way, I will also become a Shraman Upasaka endowed with all the above qualities.

Then, from the Deva-lokas, due to the exhaustion of their lifespan, until they are born as Kumaras in the Ugra-kula. Then, what pleases your mouth, like those who have performed the Karma of Nidana before?
Commentary: In this Sutra also, the description is the same as before. For example, those who perform the Karma of Nidana, whether Nirgrantha or Nirgranthi, are first born in the Deva-lokas. Then, according to their intentions, they are born as Kumaras in the Ugra-kula, etc.

Then the Sutra-kar, continuing the same topic, says:
"Would such a man, even if he were to hear the Dharma, accept it? Yes, he would accept it. Would he then have faith? Yes, he would have faith. Would he then take on the vows of conduct, including fasting and medicinal practices? Yes, he would take them on. Would he then shave his head, leave his home, and become an ascetic? No, that is not possible."

"Would such a man, even if he were to hear the Dharma, accept it? Yes, he would accept it. Would he then have faith? Yes, he would have faith. Would he then take on the vows of conduct, including fasting and medicinal practices? Yes, he would take them on. Would he then shave his head, leave his home, and become an ascetic? No, that is not possible."

Word-by-word meaning:
"Tass - of him, ṇam - indeed, tah-app-garass - of that kind, puris-jatass-avi - of that kind of man, jav - as long as, padi-ṇijja - he would hear, hanta - yes, padi-ṇijja - he would hear, se - he, ṇam - indeed, sadd-hejjā - he would have faith, jav - as long as, hanta - yes, sadd-hejjā - he would have faith, se - he, ṇam - indeed, sil-vay - vows of conduct, jav - as long as, pos-ho-vvasaiṁ - fasting and medicinal practices, padi-vajjejjā - he would take on, hanta - yes, padi-vajjejjā - he would take on, se - he, ṇam - indeed, muṇḍe - having shaved his head, bhavitta - having become, āgārāo - from his home, aṇ-gāriyaṁ - an ascetic, pavvajja - he would become, ṇo - no, tiṇ-ṭṭe - possible, sam-ṭṭe - it is not."

Meaning:
"If a Shraman or Shravak were to preach the Dharma to such a man, would he listen? Yes, he would listen. Would he then have faith? Yes, he would have faith. Would he then take on the vows of conduct, including fasting and medicinal practices? Yes, he would take them on. But it is not possible for him to shave his head, leave his home, and become an ascetic."

**With Hindi Commentary**

**Commentary:** This sutra states that after performing karma, a nirgrantha born in the Ugra and other clans hears the dharma, has faith in it, accepts the vows, fasts, and takes other medicines, but cannot take diksha. The rest is easy.

**436**

Then the sutrakar, relating to the same, says:

He becomes a Shramanopasaka, knowing the Jiva and Ajiva, and lives until he attains liberation. While living in this way, he observes the Shramanopasaka-paryaya for many years. After observing it for many years, does he reject many devotees? Yes! Rejecting them, he cuts off many devotees, both in the case of arising and non-arising of obstacles. Cutting them off, he contemplates and returns, attains samadhi, and after spending a month or a year, he is reborn as a deity in one of the devlokas. Thus, O Shraman! O Ayushman! This is the result of that karma, which prevents him from becoming completely free and renouncing the household life.

He who is endowed with all the qualities that the Shraman Upasak has described, and who wanders about giving food, water, etc., to the Shraman and Nirgranthas, and who, wandering about in this way, for many years, observes the Shraman Upasak's Paryaya, and having observed it, rejects the offerings of many devotees, does he, when disease arises or does not arise, break the fast of many devotees, and having broken it, criticizes it, and then, turning away from sin, attains Samadhi, and having attained Samadhi, in the Kalmas, by means of time, is born as a deity in one of the Devalokas? The Guru says, "Yes, he rejects the offerings of many devotees, and when disease arises or does not arise, he breaks the fast of many devotees, and having broken it, criticizes it, and then, turning away from sin, attains Samadhi, and having attained Samadhi, in the Kalmas, by means of time, is born as a deity in one of the Devalokas."

O Ayushman! Shraman! Thus, indeed, this is the fruit of the sin of that nidana, by which he who performs that nidana karma, being a monk, is not able to leave his home and accept the life of an Anagari.

**With Hindi Commentary**

**Translation:**

The tenth Dasha (state)
With Hindi Commentary.

This (Dasha) makes the one who performs it incapable of leaving home and embracing the life of an ascetic, having been completely shaved. In other words, due to the influence of this Nidana-karma (root karma), he cannot take up the life of a Sadhu (saint).

**Commentary:**

This Sutra (aphorism) concludes the discussion of the eighth Nidana-karma. The individual, imbued with the Shravak-dharma (layman's dharma), becomes a Shramanopasak (one who worships the Shramanas). All the qualities of a Shramanopasak are present in him. Thus, for many years, he adheres to the path of a Shramanopasak, and at the end of his life, he attains death through Anashan-vrat (fasting unto death), and is reborn in a celestial realm as a Deva (god) in a state of Samadhi (meditation). However, due to the influence of this Nidana-karma, he cannot embrace the complete and pure conduct of an ascetic, because he has not fully eradicated and pacified the Charitravaraniy (karma that obscures pure conduct), which would enable him to leave home and embrace the life of an ascetic. Even though he understands the Nirgrantha-pravachan (Jain teachings) correctly, he is unable to embrace the complete and pure conduct of an ascetic due to his inherent tendencies. This proves that regardless of the type of Nidana-karma, liberation lies in its complete eradication.

Now, the Sutrakar (author of the sutras) discusses the ninth Nidana-karma in sequence:

"Thus, O Shramanas! In this Dharma (Jainism), as long as one is attached to the pleasures of the celestial and human realms, he will continue to be reborn in these realms. Human pleasures are transient and fleeting, and one will eventually abandon them. Celestial pleasures are also transient, and one will eventually return to the cycle of rebirth. There are those who, due to their past actions, are born into families that are either noble, wealthy, or poor, or into families of low caste, or into families of beggars. In this way, one is born into a particular family due to his past actions. Listen to this story:

"Once upon a time, there was a..."

Thus, O Shraman! O Ayushman! I have declared the Dharma. As long as he, the one who is striving in the Dharma, attains dispassion towards the objects of enjoyment of the divine and human beings; for the objects of enjoyment of human beings are indeed uncertain and impermanent, and are to be abandoned at some point; and the objects of enjoyment of the divine are also uncertain and are to be returned to again and again. If there is a special fruit of this tapas and niyama, then we too will come in the future, in any of these low-born families, or families of the lowest, or families of the poor, or families of the miserly, or families of the beggars, in one of these families, this my soul will be born as a male, and will be able to easily escape from the cycle of existence. This is good.

Word-by-word meaning: O Shraman! O Ayushman! Thus, indeed, I have declared the Dharma. As long as he, the one who is striving in the Dharma, attains dispassion towards the objects of enjoyment of the divine and human beings; for the objects of enjoyment of human beings are indeed uncertain and impermanent, and are to be abandoned at some point; and the objects of enjoyment of the divine are also uncertain and are to be returned to again and again.

This is good.

Original meaning: O Ayushman! O Shraman! Thus I have declared the Dharma. He, the one who is striving in the Dharma, attains dispassion towards the objects of enjoyment of the divine and human beings; the objects of enjoyment of human beings are uncertain and impermanent, and are therefore to be abandoned at some point.

Page #511:
---------------------------
## Dashami Dasha
**With Hindi Commentary**

It is said that the enjoyments of the gods are also uncertain and come and go. If there is any special fruit of this austerity and discipline, then in the future, our soul may be born in one of these low, vile, insignificant, poor, miserly, and beggarly families, so that it may easily leave for initiation. This is right.

**Commentary:** This sutra describes the ninth nidana - karma. A nirgrantha thought to himself that the only means to the path of liberation is restraint. But when a person is born into a wealthy family, many obstacles arise for him to take the path of restraint. The enjoyments of gods and humans are uncertain and perishable, therefore, let me be born in a family from which I will not face any obstacles at the time of initiation. Let me be born in one of the low (adhama-varna) families, vile or low-family, poor family, miserly (kanduj) family, or beggar family, so that my soul can easily leave for initiation. I have a great desire for initiation and it can only be fulfilled when I am born in a family from which I will not face any obstacles while leaving for initiation.

Now the sutrakar says, in relation to the same subject:

**443**

-
Thus, O Shraman! O Ayushman! Whether a nirgrantha or a nirgranthi, having made a nidana, without considering that place, without retracting, all that is so. Will he, being a monk, leave the household for homelessness? Yes, he will leave. He will be liberated by that very taking of vows, until he ends all suffering, not being attached to anything.

"Would he, having become an anagarika, take pravrajya? Yes, he would take pravrajya. But he would not be successful in stopping the cycle of births and deaths in that very life, unless he were to end all suffering. This is not possible."

Padyarth Anvaya:
"O Ayushman! O Shraman! Thus, Niggantha or Nigganthi, having performed the nidana karma, without considering its consequences, and without retreating from it, the rest of the description is the same as before. Would he, having become a muni, leave his home and take pravrajya? The Guru says, "Yes, he would take pravrajya." But he would not be successful in stopping the cycle of births and deaths in that very life, unless he were to end all suffering. This is not possible."

Mulaarth:
"O Ayushman! O Shraman!

But he would not be successful in stopping the cycle of births and deaths in that very life, unless he were to end all suffering. This is not possible."

Tika:
"This sutra describes that the person who performs the nidana karma is born into those families where there is no possibility of any obstacle to taking pravrajya, according to his own intentions. Accordingly, he takes pravrajya, but the result of performing the nidana karma is that he cannot attain liberation in that very life, because the family, which was not an obstacle to taking pravrajya, becomes an obstacle to attaining liberation. Although he had a strong desire for restraint, due to his mere desire to be born in those families, he cannot end all suffering in that very life. However, it is certain..."

## Dashami Dasha
**With Hindi Commentary**

It is said that this nidana (cause) is not an obstacle on the path of Dharma, just like other nidanas. This is what should be known about the superior, medium, and inferior nidanas. In short, the result of karma is according to the sankalpas (intentions).

**445**

Then the Sutrakar (author of the sutras) says, in relation to this:

"Does it happen that those who are non-householders, Bhagavants, who are in the assembly of the path, who are in the assembly of the language, who are Brahmachari (celibate), while dwelling in that dwelling, for many years, having observed the vows, when they are afflicted or not afflicted, even when they reject the devotees? Yes, they reject them. Do they cut off many devotees from food? Yes, they cut them off. Having considered this, they return, attain samadhi, and after spending a month or a year, they are reborn as deities in other divine realms. Thus, O Shraman! O Ayushman! This is the nature of the result of this nidana, which cannot be accumulated, and by the very acceptance of this existence, it leads to liberation, until it brings an end to all suffering."

It is only when a Sadhu possesses all these qualities that they are truly called a Sadhu. When they experience illness or see the end of their life approaching, they undertake the Anashan Vrat (fasting until death). Before doing so, they carefully examine their past transgressions and perform appropriate atonement for them. Then, they attain Samadhi (enlightenment) and pass away within a period of months, being reborn in a higher realm.

**447**

Seeing all this, the Shraman Bhagwan Mahavir Swami said, "O Ayushman! Shraman! This is the result of the Nidana Karma (karma of intention), which prevents one from attaining liberation in this life. It means they cannot attain Nirvana, the end of all physical and mental suffering. Although this Nidana Karma was performed with the intention of achieving the highest level of conduct, the desire to be born in those specific families acts as an obstacle, preventing liberation. Therefore, Nidana Karma should be completely abandoned."

## Dashami Dasha
**With Hindi Commentary**

This is how the Dharma is expounded. This Nirgrantha-Pravachana is the most excellent. According to its teachings, whoever, being a Nirgrantha or Nirgranthi, exerts himself in the path of restraint and, by striving, removes his mind from all kinds of worldly desires, becomes free from the burden of attachments and remains aloof from all kinds of affection, becomes pure and spotless in character, and his character becomes firm or mature. The meaning is that when the soul is free from worldly desires, attachment, and affection, then its character becomes as pure as a mirror.

**446**

Now the question arises as to how liberation from these three can be achieved? The Sutrakar himself has provided the solution, stating that firm faith in the Nirgrantha-Pravachana can naturally lead to liberation from them. Because when someone develops firm faith in the Nirgrantha-Pravachana, they will embark on the quest for self-realization and strive for actions that liberate the soul from karmic bondage. As a result, their soul will effortlessly attain pure and enlightened consciousness. The essence of the entire statement is that one should have firm faith in the Nirgrantha-Pravachana, which will eliminate enemies like attachment, etc., and lead to the welfare of one's soul.

Now, the Sutrakar, continuing on the same theme, says:

**Tass ṇam Bhagavantasss Anuttareṇam ṇāṇeṇam Anuttareṇam dansaṇeṇam Anuttareṇam parinivvāṇam aggeṇam appāṇam bhāve-māṇass Anante Anuttare nivvāghāe nirāvaraṇe kasiṇe paḍipuṇṇe kevala varanāṇ-dansaṇe samuppajjejjā.**

**Word-by-word meaning:**

**Tass ṇam -** That Bhagavan, **Bhagavantasss -** the Lord, **Anuttareṇam -** with the highest **ṇāṇeṇam -** knowledge, **Anuttareṇam -** the most excellent **dansaṇeṇam -** vision, **Anuttareṇam -** the best **parinivvāṇam aggeṇam -** path of liberation from passions, **appāṇam -** his own soul, **bhāve-māṇass -** contemplating, **Anante -** infinite, **Anuttare -** supreme, **nivvāghāe -** liberation, **nirāvaraṇe -** without obstacles, **kasiṇe -** complete, **paḍipuṇṇe -** fulfilled, **kevala varanāṇ-dansaṇe -** pure and perfect knowledge and vision, **samuppajjejjā -** will arise.

One who dwells in his soul, or contemplates his own soul, with knowledge superior to that of intellect, knowledge, etc., with the best vision, with the best character, with the path that destroys passions like anger, etc., or the path that brings peace, i.e., the path of liberation, attains infinite, boundless, supreme, unobstructed, unobscured, complete, perfect, pure knowledge and pure vision. In summary, by engaging in the path of restraint in this way, the soul destroys all karmas and attains the aforementioned knowledge and vision. Causal karma obstructs the attainment of the aforementioned knowledge and vision, therefore it cannot be attained while it exists. But the soul, free from it, attains the aforementioned knowledge and vision in the same birth.

The sutra gives so many attributes of knowledge and vision to show their difference from the knowledge of intellect, scripture, clairvoyance, and mind-reading. These four types of knowledge are false. The word 'knowledge' alone would not convey their meaning, hence the need to give so many attributes.
The sutra also shows that only the wise, strong, and powerful can succeed in this endeavor, not others.

Then the Sutrakar, referring to the same subject, says:

He observes his remaining lifespan and rejects the devotees of the fast, and by rejecting them, he breaks the fast of many devotees, and by his final breaths, he becomes a Siddha and ends all suffering.
Dashami Dasha
Commentary - This Sutra describes the fruit of the action that is free from karma. For example, when all the karma of a person who is free from karma is destroyed, he becomes a Bhagwan, Arhan, Jin, Kevali, Sarvagya and Sarvadarshi, because a person who is free from karma becomes the recipient of many virtues. He, being a Kevali Bhagwan, wanders around seeing all the Paryayas, all the beings, in all the lokas. He wanders around seeing the motion, non-motion, position, departure, arrival, reasoning, mental state, consumed substances, previously served faults, manifest karma, hidden karma, mind, speech and actions done by mind, speech and body of all beings in the loka. Nothing can remain hidden from his knowledge, by which he always sees the three states of production, consumption and stability in substances, the state of the body and the state of existence, the departure of the gods, the birth of gods and hell beings, the reasoning of the minds of beings and mental anxieties (as they say, "This is in our mind"), and all such states, being a Kevali Bhagwan. He then sits in the assembly of humans and gods and describes in detail the five Asravas and five Samvaras for the welfare of all beings, because when a soul attains Keval-gyan and Keval-darshan, it makes it its goal to preach that just as I have achieved my welfare, so should the welfare of other souls be achieved, therefore he tells everyone the detailed description of Jiva-jiva.
He knows and sees in his knowledge the low karma like fasting, eating, stealing, etc., the hidden karma like sexual intercourse, etc., and the manifest karma like quarrelling, etc., because he is omniscient. Nothing is hidden from him, like the transition of beings, the power of superior use, virtues like knowledge, etc., and Paryayas like joy and sorrow, etc.
In this way, he observes the Kevali-Paryaya for many years, knowing his lifespan to be short, and takes up the fast. Then, by breaking the fast of the devotees, he attains Siddha-Gati by his final breaths.

Dashami Dasha
With Hindi Commentary.
453
If someone asks what is meant by 'Nirvana-pad', then one should say that the state when the soul is freed from the karma of knowledge-obscuring, perception-obscuring, feeling, delusion, lifespan, name, lineage and obstacles, is called 'Nirvana'. Upon attaining Nirvana-pad, all the passions, which cause the soul to be trapped in the bonds of the world, are burnt to ashes by the fire of knowledge, and due to this, the physical and mental suffering of the soul ends, hence it is called Nirvana. This is also called Moksha.
The soul attains this state through penance and restraint, because the soul is the seeker, penance and restraint are the means, and Nirvana-pad is the goal. When the soul attains the goal through the right means, then it becomes a Siddha, Buddha, ageless, immortal, accomplished, self-realized, omniscient, all-seeing, possessing infinite power, imperishable, indestructible and filled with knowledge. Now the sutra-kar, concluding the present topic, says:
"Evam khalu samanauso tassa anidaanasssa imeyaruve kallan-phal-vivaage jan teneva bhavaggahane nam sijjhati jav savva-dukkhanam antam kareti."
"Thus, O venerable ones! This is the nature of the auspicious fruit of that which is without cause, which is attained in the same birth, and which brings an end to all suffering."
Word-by-word meaning: Samanauso - O venerable ones! Samano! Evam khalu - thus, certainly, tassa - of that anidaanasssa - without cause, imeyaruve - this kind of kallan - auspicious, phal - fruit, vivaage - result, jan - by which, teneva - by that very, bhavaggahane nam - in the attainment of existence, sijjhati - is attained, jav - until, savva - all, dukkhanam - suffering, antam - end, kareti - makes.
Meaning: O venerable ones! This is the auspicious result of that action which is without cause, which is attained in the same birth, and which brings an end to all suffering.

## Chapter 454: Dasha-Shruta-Skandha Sutra

**Commentary:** This Sutra, like the previous one, describes the fruits of karma without a cause. A person who performs an action without a cause will receive the excellent fruit of attaining liberation in the same life. This is because actions are the only obstacles to liberation. When they are absent, liberation will happen automatically. The fruits of noble actions are always beneficial. Here, the noble action of restraint leads to the fruit of attaining Nirvana in the same life. This statement also proves that restraint without causal karma is the only action that produces beneficial results.

**The Tenth Dasha:**

Now, the Sutra-kar (author of the Sutra) speaks about the success of the teachings of the Bhagavan (Lord):

**Translation:**

"After this, many Nirgranthas (liberated souls) and Nirgranthya (those on the path to liberation), having heard this meaning from the Shraman (ascetic) Bhagavan Mahavira, with hearts filled with joy, bow down to and pay homage to the Shraman Bhagavan Mahavira. After bowing down and paying homage, they contemplate that place and return, performing the appropriate atonement and austerities."

**Word-by-word meaning:**

* Tate - after this
* Nan - many
* Niggantha - Nirgranthas (liberated souls)
* Ya - and
* Nigganthyo - Nirgranthya (those on the path to liberation)
* Samanas - Shraman (ascetic)
* Bhagavo - Bhagavan (Lord)
* Mahaviras - Mahavira
* Antiye - from
* Eyamatt - this meaning
* Soccha - hearing
* Nisam - with heart filled with joy
* Samanam - Shraman (ascetic)
* Bhagavam - Bhagavan (Lord)
* Mahaviram - Mahavira
* Vandanti - bow down
* Namasanti - pay homage
* Vanditta - after bowing down
* Namasitta - after paying homage
* Tassa - that
* Thanassa - place
* Aloयंति - contemplate
* Padikkama - return
* Jav - as long as
* Aharigham - appropriate
* Payachchitta - atonement
* Tavo-kamma - austerities
* Padivajjanti - perform

Page #523:
---------------------------
## Dashami Dasha
**With Hindi Commentary**

**455**

**Original Meaning:** After this, many Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis, upon hearing this meaning from the Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira Swami and contemplating it in their hearts, worshipped Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira Swami and bowed to him. Then, after worshipping and bowing, they immediately criticized themselves and retreated from their sinful karma. They engaged in penance-like tapasya karma as appropriate.

**Commentary:** This sutra shows the success of Bhagwan's teachings. When Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira Swami revealed the nine types of nidana karma and their sinful results, many Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis, fearing worldly wandering and knowing the terrible results of those nidana karma, presented themselves before Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira Swami, worshipped him according to the proper procedure, and bowed to him with their heads lowered. After worshipping and bowing, they criticized their own nidana karma in front of him, retreated from it, and accepted appropriate tapasya karma from Shraman Bhagwan himself for its purification.

This statement clearly proves that if one commits any kind of fault, one should go to the Guru and criticize that fault, and one should definitely undertake penance to become pure from it. Just as one has to seek the refuge of a physician to cure a disease and one becomes healthy through his medicine, similarly, one should seek the refuge of the Guru to purify a fault and one should definitely consume the medicine of penance. Just as the soul, knowing the pleasures of health, constantly strives to attain it, similarly, the soul that experiences the pleasures of a pure soul engages in self-purification through criticism, etc. Many men consider it their virtue to hide their sins, but that is their mistake. In reality, not committing sin is the virtue of every individual. If, due to mistake or carelessness, one commits sinful karma, then it is one's virtue to purify it through criticism, etc.

Page #524:

456
Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
If someone were to say that there were also weak-souled ascetics in the assembly of the Lord Shraman Mahavir who performed such an action, the answer is that it is not surprising that the tendencies of the karmas that bind the soul work on many souls. But even if this happens, if their minds become alert again, their courage, bravery, and steadfastness in the words of Lord Shraman Mahavir Swami are proven, because they purified their souls in the presence of the assembly after hearing the teachings of the Lord. In such a state, when they fall below even the eleventh guna-sthana, what to speak of the sixth and earlier sthanas.
This sutra clearly proves the steadfastness and righteousness (simplicity) of the ascetics and ascetics, which is the supreme virtue of asceticism.
Dashami Dasha
This sutra teaches that if someone has a secret or manifest fault, they should criticize it in front of their elders and purify their soul well. Just as the monks purified their souls in the presence of the Lord.
Now the sutrakar concludes the present topic by saying:
At that time, at that time, the Shraman Bhagavan Mahavir was in the city of Rayagih, in the Gunasil, in the midst of many ascetics, many ascetics, many lay followers, many lay followers, many gods, many goddesses, in the assembly of all gods, humans, and demons, he saw this, he spoke this, he preached this. The name of this Ayatithana is today! Today's study is a complete, well-reasoned, well-reasoned sutra, both its meaning and its meaning, enjoy it! I have spoken.
The name of this Ayatithana is Dashami Dasha, complete.

**Original Meaning:**

At that time and at that moment, the Shramana, the Venerable Lord Mahavira, in the city of Rajagriha, in the Caitya named Gunasil, in the midst of many Shramanas, Shramanis, Shravakas, Shravikas, Devas, and Devis, and the assembly of Devas, humans, and Asuras, was seated and explained thus, spoke thus, and explained with results, showing the fruits of actions: "The name Ayati-sthana, O Aryas! The study is meaningful, with a cause, with a reason, both the Sutra and the meaning, both of them, are repeatedly shown, thus I say."

Dasha Shruta Skandha Sutra
Tenth Dasha
"O Aryas! The meaning, cause and reason of the Dasha called Ayati Sthana, along with the Sutra meaning and both (of them) have been preached!" Thus, describing the preaching, the Sutrakar says, "Thus, O disciples! I say to you."
The tenth Dasha called Ayati Sthana ends.
Commentary- This Sutra concludes the Dasha presented. It was the fourth Aarak of the Avasarpini Kala. Shri Bhagwan Mahavira Swami was present at that time. He was seated in the Gunashil Chaitya of Rajgriha Nagar and was giving the nectar of preaching to all the people. Around him were seated many Shraman, Shramani, Shravak, Shravika, Dev, Devi and humans and Asuras. Seated in the midst of that assembly, Shri Bhagwan began to expound, thus showing the results of Nidana Karma, "O Aryas! When a person performs Nidana Karma in the aforementioned manner, he has to suffer the aforementioned sinful results. Although worldly wealth and the wealth of the Devas are attained by him, yet due to the non-attainment of Samyaktva etc., he has to experience the sufferings of hell. Therefore, the one who performs the said Karma earns only the fruit of sin. It has such a disastrous result that even for those souls who have attained the qualities of Samyaktva etc., Nidana Karma becomes a restriction or obstacle to the attainment of Shramanopasaka, Sadhutva and Moksha-pada. Therefore, it is despicable."
But those who do not perform Nidana Karma, if they can destroy Karma, attain Nirvana-pada in the same birth. There is no obstacle in their path. For the one who performs Nidana Karma, even after the destruction of all other Karmas, the same (Nidana Karma) appears as an obstacle.
"Thus, Shri Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira gave a meaningful sermon in the assembly of Devas, humans and Asuras. Although Shri Bhagwan's language is Ardhamagadhi, yet due to his extraordinary eloquence, every creature understands its meaning in his own language. Just as the water of a single-flavored cloud (rain) is transformed into the desired flavor of every tree, so should one know about the language of Bhagwan."

Page #527:
---------------------------
## Dashami Dasha
**With Hindi Commentary**

Here, a question may arise: What is meant by Ayati-Sthan? In response, it is said: "Ayatirnamoत्तरकालः 'Ayatistuत्तरः kaal' iti vachanaat tasya sthanam padamityarthaḥ" which means that the place where the result occurs in the future, after birth, is called Ayati-Sthan.

**456**

Shri Bhagwan described this Dasha with its meaning, cause, and reason. He explained the subject again and again, with reference to the Sutra in terms of Atmagam, with reference to the meaning in terms of Vyākhyā, and with reference to both (Sutra and meaning). He also explained that "Jnānakriyābhyām mokshaḥ" - liberation can only be achieved through right knowledge and right conduct (charitra), and not otherwise. Liberation cannot be achieved by knowledge alone, nor by conduct alone, but only when both knowledge and conduct come together, can the soul be absorbed in the goal of liberation. Therefore, Shri Bhagwan gave a detailed discourse on this subject, saying: "O Aryas! You can destroy karma through Pandit-Veerya, and increase the cycle of Samsara through Baal-Veerya, and you can go towards the goal through both Baal and Pandit-Veerya. But Pandit-Veerya can only be achieved when actions are performed without any Nidana (cause). Then, with that same Pandit-Veerya, the soul can destroy the eight types of karma and attain liberation. Thus, the assembly was delighted to hear the repeated teachings of Shri Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira Swami and became eager to worship according to Bhagwan's instructions.

Shri Sudharma Swami says to Shri Jambu Swami: "O disciple! Just as I heard the meaning of the tenth Dasha, called Ayati-Nama, from the mouth of Shri Bhagwan, I have conveyed the same to you. I have not added anything from my own intellect."

Sutra Anukramanika

1. Thus indeed, the ascetic (samana) has come to this place.
2. The state of non-attachment (anidanasya dasa 10) has arisen.
3. This mind, having been concentrated (odhidamsane va se savva savvaha savva carittha), is for the abandonment of suffering (dukkhapahanaaya).
4. The state of increase (parivudhe dasa 10) leads to quarreling.
5. Thus indeed, the ascetic (samanauso) there, what kind of fault (pamicca) is there?
6. Thus indeed, even the gods (deve yavi bhavati) have come.
7. Thus indeed, some (kei) have recited (puvva-sanlvittae dasa 3 jāva patisuṇittae dasa 10) the king's (rayaniyassa) previous association.
8. Thus indeed, the ascetic (samanauso) should go to the state of equanimity (nivveya gaccheijja).
9. Go, you dear ones (devanuppiya), they will certainly renounce (vippajahaniijja dasa 10).
10. Thus indeed, O ascetic (samanauso)! I have taught the doctrine (dhamma pannatte).
11. The hidden conduct (gudhacarī) should be concealed (nigūhijjā).
12. Until the end, in this very Nirgantha doctrine (iṇameva niggaṇṭhe pavayaṇe jāva antaṃ), the four-monthly monk's vow (cau-māsiyā bhikkhu-patiṃmā dasa 7) is performed.
13. In the final stage, he should live (carima careiijā).
14. Thus indeed, O ascetic (samanauso), without considering (aṇāloyya), he perceives the gross (orāliyaṃ boṇdi).
15. The unobstructed (appatikaṃte) attains (paccāyāti dasa 10).
16. Thus indeed, O ascetic (samanauso)! The Nirgantha (niggaṇṭhī) has a vow (nidāṇaṃ), the six-monthly monk's vow (cha-māsiyā bhikkhu-patiṃmā) has been done, and that place (tassa ṭhāṇassa dasa 10).
17. If this is your vow of asceticism and celibacy (tava-niyama-baṃhaceriyaṃ), thus indeed, O ascetic (samanauso), I have taught the doctrine (dhamma pannatte).
18. If this is the vow (tava-niyamassa dasa 10), thus indeed, O ascetic (samanauso), the truth (sacce) in this doctrine (pavayaṇe) remains (sesaṃ taṃ ajjāyamāṇe vā jāva dasa 10).
19. What he relies on (niṣṣiye) raises up (uvvahati), thus indeed, O ascetic (samanauso), the supporters (uvavattāro).
20. What I know from before (jaṃpi jāṇe itṭo puvvaṃ), they become (bhavanti) such as the great powers (mahiddīesu).
21. When the obstruction to right vision (darśanāvaraṇaṃ) is destroyed (jaya se), the knowledge (jñānāvaraṇaṃ) is attained (sādati dasa 10).
22. Thus indeed, O ascetic (samanauso), he should strive (parakkamejjā) for the doctrine (dhammassa) of the Nirgantha (niggaṇṭhe) teaching (sikkhāe dasa 10), just as one burns (daddhaṇaṃ) the seeds (bīyāṇaṃ).
23. The state of equanimity (samaḍhe dasa 10) is like a fish-hook (matthayu sūiye).
24. Thus indeed, the monthly monk's vow (māsiyaṃ bhikkhu patimaṃ) is the state of restraint (javaṭṭiyaṃ pativiriyaṃ).
25. The supreme doctrine (ahāsuttaṃ) is for the one (jassa ṇaṃ dhammassa) who learns the Nirgantha (niggaṇṭhe) teaching (sikkhāe dasa 10), knowing (jāṇamāṇo) the well-established (saṃniddhāe) earth (puḍhavīe dasa 1).

"Samadhikarak Swadhyay" - Just as the seven notes and ragas have their designated times, the raga of that time, if sung at that time, is surely pleasurable, and if a raga is sung against the time, it is not enjoyable, similarly, one should know about the study of scriptures. And just as marriage ceremony before the Vidyaarambh Sanskar and bathing etc. after food are not pleasurable, and just as speaking without considering the time is considered to be a producer of strife, similarly, Swadhyay done without method is not beneficial. And just as people wear clothes on their body in the right place - if they are worn without method and on opposite limbs, they become worthy of ridicule. Similarly, one should know about Swadhyay. Therefore, it is proved that Swadhyay done according to the method is considered to be Samadhikarak.

The Matrakandha Sutra advocates for the attainment of equanimity. The soul, since time immemorial, has been striving relentlessly for happiness. However, it has not been able to attain it. Even if it experiences happiness for a short while, it soon turns into sorrow. The root cause of this is attachment. As long as the soul remains attached to attachment, it cannot attain eternal happiness. Therefore, Acharya Haribhadra Suriji has written: "Whether one is a Svetambara or a Digambara, a Buddhist or a follower of another religion, I declare with certainty that the soul imbued with equanimity will surely attain liberation." Therefore, seekers pray to their chosen deity, "O Lord, grant me the strength to be established in equanimity." Acharya Amitagati's composition on this subject is particularly thought-provoking. He pleads with his deity, "In sorrow or happiness, in the presence of enemies or friends, in separation from the beloved or union with the undesirable, in a palace or in a forest, in all situations, may my mind always be steadfast in equanimity, completely devoid of the sense of 'mine'." When attachment arises, the human mind becomes agitated by the union with the beloved and the separation from the undesirable. Mental imbalance prevents the human being from attaining self-realization. By being established in equanimity, one can attain the true nature of the self. The path to attaining equanimity is expounded in this Agam-Dasha-Shruta-Skandha Sutra. This is why Acharya Dev Pujya Shri Atma Ram Ji Maharaj, by writing a detailed Hindi commentary on this Agam text, has rendered a great service to seekers. It is certain that when seekers diligently study, contemplate, and reflect on this gem of a text, they will surely attain firmness in equanimity. The goal of the seeker is...
