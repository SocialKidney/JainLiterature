**Prakashkiya**

One of the major and creative objectives of the Marudhar Kesari Sahitya Prakashan Samiti is to publish literature related to Jainism and philosophy. The institution's guiding light, the revered founder, Late Shri Marudhar Kesariji Maharaj, himself was a great scholar, poet, and a guide to the right path of Agama Darshan. The institution's various philanthropic activities are still ongoing under his guidance. Gurudev Shri was also a connoisseur of literature and a devotee. Inspired by him, we have published numerous books on discourses, biographies, poetry, Agamas, and profound critical analyses. Now, we are presenting the second edition of the Karmagranth Part 5 to scholars and inquisitive readers.

Karmagranth is a great text of Jain philosophy. It contains a comprehensive discussion of the principles of Karma. Under the guidance of the revered Gurudev Shri, renowned scholars of Jain philosophy and literature, Editor Shri Shri Chandji Surana and his associate Shri Devkumarji Jain, have jointly edited this profound text. Its first edition was published in 1976, which has been exhausted, and the demand from readers has been constant. In response to the demand of the readers, the committee members sought permission for its second edition from the founder Shri Rupchandji Maharaj and the co-founder Shri Sukhanmuniji Maharaj. Accordingly, with the approval and inspiration of Gurudev Shri, this second edition is now presented to the readers. It is hoped that those who are curious about the Karma theory, students, etc., will benefit from it.

The key to understanding Jain philosophy is the 'Karma Siddhanta'. It is certain that it is the basis of the entire philosophy and metaphysics. It reveals the mystery of the various states and forms of the soul and its transformations. Therefore, to understand Jain philosophy, it is essential to understand 'Karma Siddhanta'. 

The 'Karma Granth' written by Shrimad Devendrasuri is of particular importance among the major texts that discuss 'Karma Siddhanta'. They hold a very important place in Jain literature. Those who are curious about metaphysics also consider the 'Karma Granth' as scripture and study them daily.

The Sanskrit commentaries on the 'Karma Granth' are very important. There have also been many Gujarati translations of them. The first commentary on the 'Karma Granth' in Hindi was presented by the learned scholar, the great sage, Pandit Sukhlalji. His style is comparative and evidence-based. Pandit Sukhlalji's commentary is now almost inaccessible. For some time, there has been inspiration from Ashukavi Ratna Gurudev Shri Marudhar Kesariji Maharaj to present a commentary on the 'Karma Granth' in a modern style. This compilation began under his inspiration and guidance. With the inspiration of Vidya Vinod Shri Sukhanmuniji, this work progressed rapidly. The support of Shri Devkumarji Jan was received and the work became ready to take shape in a short time.

In this compilation work, the ancient text writers, commentators, commentators, and especially the works of Pandit Shri Sukhlalji have been helpful.

I am deeply indebted to the guidance of the revered Shri Marudhar Kesariji Maharaj, the inspiration of Shri Rajtamuni ji and Shri Suknamuni ji, and the cooperation of the officials of the Sahitya Samiti, especially the heartfelt inspiration and cooperation of the Samiti's administrator Shri Sujanmalji Sethia, which has brought dynamism to the editing and publication of the book. It would be entirely appropriate for me to express my heartfelt gratitude.
If there are any errors, theoretical mistakes, ambiguities, or printing errors in the discussion, I apologize and request the kind readers to kindly inform me. Those who help in correcting errors and avoiding mistakes are commendable. With this request,
Second Edition
This second edition of "Karmagranth" Part 5 is being printed. Today, our Gurudev is not among us, but the treasure of knowledge he bestowed upon us is still guiding us all. The chief disciple of Gurudev, the Up-Pravartak Shri Suknamuni ji, is keeping that light of knowledge alive and inspiring and encouraging us all today. It is with his auspicious inspiration that this second edition of "Karmagranth" is reaching the hands of the readers. Joy.

## The Mouth of Inquiry

This is the basis of discussion.

The same is the cause of our happiness and sorrow.

Jain philosophy is the complete thought, contemplation and soul. The soul is an all-powerful, independent force, the creator, and the one who experiences the fruits of its actions. The soul itself is formless, perfectly pure, but it is embodied with the body, becoming impure and wandering in the world. Despite being the very essence of bliss, it is being ground in the mill of happiness and sorrow. Though immortal, it is caught in the flow of birth and death. It is astonishing that the one who is supremely powerful is also experiencing torment and suffering in the form of the lowly, the sorrowful, the poor. What is the reason for this?

Jain philosophy, while examining this reason, says that karma is the one that makes the soul wander in the world. Karma is the root of birth and death. "Kammam cha ai maranassa mulan" - this statement of Lord Mahavira is absolutely true, a fact. Due to karma, this world is constantly changing in various strange events. While theistic philosophies attribute this diversity of the world and happiness and sorrow to God, Jain philosophy considers the soul and its main helper, karma, as the root cause of all happiness and sorrow and the diversity of the world. Karma is not an independent force, it is itself a pudgala, inert. But when performed by the soul under the influence of attachment and aversion, they become so powerful and potent that they bind the doer in their bondage. They make the master dance like a servant. This is the strange power of karma. What is this karma, the main seed of all changes in our life and the world, what is its nature? How do its various results occur? This is a very serious subject. In Jain philosophy...

---------------------------
Karma has been described in great detail. A very subtle and profound analysis of karma is found in the Jain Agamas and subsequent texts. Being in Prakrit and Sanskrit languages, it is indeed meant for scholars, but it is difficult to understand for ordinary seekers. Ancient Acharyas have described the various forms of karma theory in brief, which proves to be a good source of knowledge for ordinary seekers of truth.

The Karmagranth holds an important place among the ancient texts on karma theory. This book, written by Shrimad Devendrasur, is a complete and comprehensive work. It presents a discussion of all aspects of Jain philosophy, including karma, space, time, living beings, non-living beings, and their various classifications. The book is written in complex Prakrit language and has many famous commentaries in Sanskrit. Its discussion is also quite famous in Gujarati. A famous scholar and sage, Pt. Shri Mukhlalji, had prepared a commentary on it in Hindi about 40 years ago.

Currently, the Hindi commentary on Karmagranth was becoming difficult to obtain, and the style of commentary had also changed significantly by this time. Many seekers of truth, monks, and devout lay followers had been requesting for many years from the revered Gurudev Marudhar Kesariji Maharaj Saheb that a vast and profound text like Karmagranth should be commented upon and published in a new way. Only a capable scholar, learned, and great saint like you can accomplish this extremely laborious and expensive task. Gurudevji also felt inclined towards this and resolved to take this work forward. He started writing the commentary. The responsibility of making the commentary beautiful and informative through language, style, etc., and the work of footnotes, collection of quotes from Agamas, introduction, writing, etc., was given to the famous scholar Shriyut Shrichandji Surana.

Handed over. Shri Suranaji Gurudev Shri has been in very close contact with the literature and thoughts of Gurudev. Under the guidance of Gurudev, he has prepared this scholarly and useful lin by working very hard. A long-standing deficiency is being fulfilled. At the same time, the society is getting a cultural and philosophical treasure in a new form, which is a matter of great joy.
I am particularly interested in this subject. I have been motivating Gurudev and the editor friends from time to time for its completion. After four parts, this fifth part is coming before the public today. I am very happy about it.
This fifth part is even more detailed than the previous four parts, the subject is deep, for the clarity of the deep subject, expansion also becomes necessary. The learned editor friends have done a deep analysis of the subject with a lot of effort and review of many books. Hopefully, it will be the cause of knowledge enhancement for the inquisitive readers. Second Edition
Today, after almost 13 years, this second edition of the fifth part of "Karmagranth" is reaching the hands of the readers. It has been included in the curriculum of many institutions. This is clear evidence of the usefulness of this book. The book was unavailable for a long time, this year the decision to publish the second edition was taken during the Chaturmas in Madras with the publisher Shri Rupchandji Maharaj Saheb, accordingly the book is in the hands of the readers.
Today, revered Gurudev Shri is not present among us, but wherever he is, his divine power will continue to inspire and guide us. With this auspicious blessing, in the memory of revered Gurudev Shri,

The Essence of Karma Theory

Karma theory is the bedrock of Indian thinkers and sages. In reality, it is the foundation of the Astika (orthodox) schools of thought. It can also be said that Karma theory is the foundation of Astika philosophies. Although there may be differences in the definition of Karma, the attainment of spiritual liberation is based on the liberation from Karma. There is no difference in this. Every philosophy has examined Karma in some form or another! Jain philosophy has examined it in great detail and with great subtlety. 

All living beings in the world exhibit many kinds of inequalities and diversities. All the Atmavadin (soul-believing) philosophies have accepted Karma theory as the reason for this. The Anatmavadin (non-soul believing) Buddhist philosophy has clearly stated its acceptance of Karma theory:

_All beings experience the fruits of their actions, all beings are the masters of their own Karma, they are born in different species according to their Karma, their Karma is their own bondage, their Karma is their own liberation, they are elevated or degraded by their Karma. (Milinda Panha, p. 50.81)_ 

Page #9:
---------------------------
Acharya Jayant has also stated the same thing:

"The diversity of the world, from happiness to sorrow, is due to the difference in karma. Even in agriculture, service, and other activities, there is a unique outcome. Some people get unexpected wealth, while others are struck by lightning. Some achieve success without effort, while others fail even after great effort. These things are not due to any visible cause. Therefore, one should assume that there is some invisible cause.

(Nyayamnjari, page 42, second part)

In other words, some people are happy in the world, while others are unhappy. Even after doing things like farming, working, etc., some people get special benefits, while others have to suffer losses. Some people get sudden wealth, while others are struck by lightning while sitting. Some people achieve success without effort, while others do not get results even after great effort. All these things do not happen due to any visible cause. Therefore, one should assume that there is some invisible cause.

Similarly, theists generally agree on this point:

"Karma is the main thing in the world. Whatever one does, one gets the fruit of it."

The nature of karma

Although there is agreement between theists and atheists, soul believers and non-soul believers about the theory of karma, there is a fundamental difference of opinion regarding the nature of karma and its relationship to its fruits.

In common language, whatever is done is called karma. For example, eating, drinking, walking, talking, thinking, painting, etc. But karma does not only mean this. 

Page #10:
---------------------------
Therefore, the philosophers of the afterlife have adopted a specific meaning of karma. They believe that every good and bad deed of ours leaves behind a संस्कार (sanskara), which is called नैयायिक (naiyayik) and बैशेषिक (vaisheshik) धर्माधर्म (dharma-adharma). The Yogis refer to it as आशय (aashaya) and बौद्ध अनुशय (bauddha anushaya). There is a difference in the names used to explain the meaning of karma, but they all imply that beings trapped in the cycle of birth, aging, and death are entangled in ignorance, delusion, and falsehood. Due to this, they are unable to understand the true nature of the world. Therefore, whatever they do is based on ignorance, and they are attached to it with passion and aversion. Hence, every action of theirs becomes a cause of bondage for the soul.

If we summarize the views of these philosophers, it becomes clear that according to them, karma is a name for action or tendency, and at the root of that tendency lies passion and aversion. Although this tendency is momentary, its effect lasts until the time of its fruition. As a result, a tradition of संस्कार (sanskara) leading to tendency and tendency leading to संस्कार (sanskara) continues, and this is called the world. But according to Jain philosophy, the nature of karma is different from these views in some respects. In Jain philosophy, karma is not just a संस्कार (sanskara) but a material substance that, attracted by the action of passion, aversion, and delusion, merges with the soul in the same way that water mixes with milk. Although it is a substance, it is not physical, but its name karma has become established because it is attracted to the soul due to the soul's karma, i.e., निय (niya), and becomes bound to it. This substance is taken in from all six directions, and it is in the जीव प्रदेश (jiva pradesh), the region of the soul. 

Page #11:
---------------------------
[14.
The soul is made up of countless, subtle, karmic, and infinite atoms located in the field. The soul attracts karma from all its regions, from its subtle body. Each karma-skandha is bound to all the regions of the soul, and these karma-skandhas are the cause of different types of knowledge-obscuration, etc. Countless karma-pudgala-skandhas cling to each region of the soul.
The meaning of the above statement is that while other philosophies call every action of a being afflicted by attachment and aversion as karma, and while they consider the resulting impressions to be permanent even though the karma is transient, Jain philosophy believes that with every action of a being afflicted by attachment and aversion, a type of substance enters the soul, which becomes bound to the soul after becoming the cause of its results in the form of attachment and aversion. In due course, the same substance gives the soul good or bad results.
Jain philosophy has named the soul's transformation due to attachment and aversion and the associated attracted and bound physical substance as bhavakarma and dravyakarma respectively. Bhavakarma can be compared to the vritti of Yoga philosophy and the pravritti of Nyaya philosophy, but there is a difference in the nature of karma in Jain philosophy and the way other philosophies consider the nature of karma. Jain philosophy believes that everything we see around us with our dharma-chakshus is pudgala substance. This pudgala substance is divided into twenty-three types of categories, and among them is a karman category, which pervades the entire universe. This karman category, when it becomes the cause of the soul's emotions, becomes transformed into subtle matter.
When the soul, filled with attachment and aversion, engages in good or bad actions, it enters the karman category, causing knowledge-obscuration, etc. ] 

Page #12:
---------------------------
[15]
When karma, in the form of dust (raj), enters the soul, it does so through the process of obscuring knowledge (jnanaavaran). The soul is formless (amurti) and karma is formed (murtik). In such a state, their binding is not possible. Because the binding of the formed with the formed is possible, but how is the binding of the formless with the formed possible?

The solution is that, unlike other philosophies, Jainism considers the soul and the flow of karma to be beginningless (anadi). There is no belief that the soul was previously pure and then became bound. Because this belief has many inconsistencies and raises doubts. To clarify the beginningless relationship between the soul and karma, the Acharyas have provided a logical solution, which is as follows:

"Those who are in the chariot of the world, they have results (parinaama) of attachment and aversion. From those results, new karma binds, and from the binding of those karma, they take birth in the different realms (gati)."

This statement means that every worldly soul has been filled with attachment and aversion since beginningless time. Due to that attachment and aversion, karma binds. As a result, there are repeated births and deaths in different realms, and from that binding, birth and death, the cycle of the world continues uninterrupted.

When a new realm is attained by taking birth, the Acharyas, guiding us through the subsequent order, say that: 

Page #13:
---------------------------
The body arises from the body, and the senses arise from the body. From the senses, there is the grasping of objects, and from that, there arises attachment and aversion. Thus, the state of the living being arises in this cycle of existence. 

As the Jina sages have said, the flow of karma is endless and without beginning for the unenlightened being, and it is endless but has a beginning for the enlightened being.

From the above statement, it becomes clear that the worldly being is bound by karmic matter from time immemorial. When the being is bound by karmic matter, the new karmas that bind it are bound along with the karmic matter already present in the being. This is because karmic matter combines with karmic matter, and karmic matter binds with karmic matter. Therefore, new karmas are acquired along with the old karmas residing in the soul. Thus, one should understand the relationship between the soul and the karmic matter as being inseparable.

In essence, in Jain philosophy, the karmic matter associated with the living being and the emotions of attachment and aversion that arise from it are called karma. Karma is not merely the name for good and bad actions performed by the living being, but also the subtle matter that is attracted and bound to the being as a result of its actions. These subtle matter particles are also called karma, and the emotions of lust, anger, etc., that arise in the being as a result of the fruition of these subtle matter particles are also called karma. 

The relationship is not to be misunderstood... 

In Jain philosophy, the soul, like the Brahman principle in Vedic philosophy, is pure, ... 

Page #14:
---------------------------
(17)
The pure element is considered to be the soul (Jiva). While describing the nature of the soul from the beginning of time, the Rasahis have described it as being without form and possessing the quality of consciousness. Furthermore, the Tattvartha Sutra describes the soul as having the characteristic of use, but this supports the aforementioned statement. Because knowledge and perception are aspects of consciousness. The word "use" refers to these.

Except for the soul, other substances that do not possess knowledge and perception are called non-soul (Ajeev). Inert, unconscious are synonyms for non-soul. Scientists have described many such inert substances. But Jain philosophy classifies and describes five such substances, namely: Dharma, Adharma, Akash, Kal, and Udgal. All the substances described by scientists are included in these. Combining the soul with the aforementioned five elements results in six elements. These six elements are called six substances (Dravyas).

Out of the aforementioned six substances, Dharma, Adharma, Akash, and Kal are considered to be eternally unchanging. Their nature never undergoes transformation or change due to any cause. But the soul and Pudgal are two substances that are both changeable and unchanging. When they are associated with other substances, they are changeable, and in their absence, they are unchanging. According to this, the soul and Pudgal have two divisions each. The worldly and the liberated are the two divisions of the soul, and the atom (Anu) and the aggregate (Skandha) are the two divisions of Pudgal. The soul is unchanging in its liberated state and changeable in its worldly state. Pudgal is unchanging in its atomic state and changeable in its aggregate state. The implication is that as long as the soul and Pudgal remain associated with other substances, their nature undergoes transformation due to that association. This... 

Page #15:
---------------------------
They remain विकारी (changeable) at that time and become अविकारी (unchangeable) as soon as the संश्लेष (combination) is removed.

The combination of जीव (soul) and पुद्गल (matter) with other substances depends on their योग्यता (capacity). Other substances do not have this capacity.  The जीव has मिथ्यात्व (falsehood), अविरति (non-restraint), प्रमाद (carelessness), कापाय (trembling), and योग (state) as its capacity, while the पुद्गल has स्निग्ध (smooth) and रूक्ष (rough) गुण (qualities) as its capacity. The जीव is bound to other substances due to मिथ्यात्व (falsehood), and the पुद्गल is bound to other substances due to its स्निग्ध (smooth) and रूक्ष (rough) qualities.

The capacity of the जीव, such as मिथ्यात्व (falsehood), etc., exists only before the संश्लेष (combination), and through this, it becomes मलिन (impure) by accepting कर्मवर्गणा (karmic particles). But when did it start accepting कर्मवर्गणा (karmic particles)? When did the connection between the two begin? The answer to this can be found in the word अनादि (beginningless). Because if we assume an आदि (beginning), many inconsistencies arise. For example, if the connection has an आदि (beginning), then which came first, the आत्मा (soul) or the कर्म (karma), or did they both come into existence simultaneously? In the first case, the pure आत्मा (soul) does not perform कर्म (karma). In the second case, कर्म (karma) cannot be created without a कर्ता (doer). In the third case, two substances that come into existence simultaneously cannot be कर्ता (doer) and कर्म (karma) of each other. Therefore, it is logical to believe that the connection between कर्म (karma) and आत्मा (soul) is अनादि (beginningless).

Haribhadrasuri, in his योगशतक (Yoga Shataka) verse 55, gives a beautiful example to explain the अनादित्व (beginninglessness) of आत्मा (soul) and कर्म (karma). We experience the present moment, yet the present is अनादि (beginningless) because the past is infinite, and no past can exist without a present. The flow of this present has been going on since अनादि (beginningless). Similarly, कर्म (karma) and... 

Page #16:
---------------------------
The soul's connection is eternal from the perspective of flow. However, it is important to understand that karma, like clay, is eternal and unchanging. Just as fire can melt clay and purify gold, so too can auspicious rituals break the eternal bond of karma and purify the soul.

The process of karma-binding with the soul is of four types: 1) **Praकृतिबन्ध** (Nature-binding), 2) **स्थितिबन्ध** (State-binding), 3) **अनुभागबन्ध** (Section-binding), and 4) **प्रदेशबन्ध** (Region-binding).

At the time of reception, karma particles are uniform. However, during the time of burning, they develop different natures to obstruct the soul's knowledge, perception, etc. This is called **Praकृतिबन्ध**. The determination of their time limit is **स्थितिबन्ध**. The presence of three flavors (intense, moderate, and mild) in karma-binding, according to the intensity and mildness of the soul's transformations, is called **अनुभागबन्ध**. And the unification of karma particles with the soul's regions or the determination of the number of karma regions is called **प्रदेशबन्ध**.

The first karma text beautifully explains these four types of karma-binding using the example of a sweetmeat (**मोदक**). Just as a sweetmeat is either bile-reducing or phlegm-reducing, depending on its nature, the duration of its nature is its state. Its sweetness or bitterness depends on its flavor, and its weight depends on its atoms. Thus, this metaphor of the sweetmeat clearly indicates the process of karma-binding.

Of the above four types of binding, **Praकृतिबन्ध**, **योग शक्ति**, and **प्रदेशबन्ध** are caused by the soul, while **स्थितिबन्ध** and **अनुभागबन्ध** are caused by the **काषायिक परिणाम** (results of passions). Karma-binding is of two types: 

Page #17:
---------------------------
There are two types of bondage: 1) Saṃpārāyika and 2) Īpithika. The bondage of the Akṣayī is Saṃpārāyika. It is the cause of the infinite cycle of existence. The bondage of the Akṣayī is Īpithika, in which karma particles bind with the soul for the first time and are destroyed in the second. This bondage does not have any effect on the soul.

There are two perspectives in Jain philosophy for the representation of reality, known as Niścayanaya and Vyavahāranaya. Niścayanaya refers to the statement of the true nature of a thing without any external influence, while Vyavahāranaya refers to the statement of a thing in relation to external influences. In Jain philosophy, the concept of the soul's agency and experience of karma is also considered from these two perspectives.

The nature of karma has been explained earlier, and it has also been indicated that karma has an eternal relationship with the soul. When we consider the agency and experience of karma from the perspective of Niścaya, the soul is neither the doer of the material karma nor the experiencer of its fruits. Because material karma is pāṅgalika, a modification of the pudgala substance, it is therefore external. The doer of karma cannot be the conscious soul. The karma of the conscious is in the form of consciousness, and the karma of the unconscious is in the form of unconsciousness. If the karma of the conscious were to become unconscious, the distinction between the conscious and the unconscious would be destroyed, leading to the fault of mixture. This means that every substance is the doer of its own nature, not the doer of external influences. For example, water is naturally cool, but it becomes hot due to its contact with fire. However, water cannot be said to be the doer of this heat, because heat is the property of fire, and it has come to water due to its contact with fire, and is therefore imposed. As soon as the contact with fire is removed, the heat disappears. Similarly, the pudgala substance, which becomes karma due to the influence of the soul's impure emotions, 

Page #18:
---------------------------
Forms are transformed, the doer of them is the pudgala itself, the jiva is the doer of them. It cannot be, the jiva is the doer of its own perceptions. This very thing is made clear in the time-honored gatha 86.8, the essence of which is:

The jiva does its own raga-dvesha-adi forms of feelings, but by getting the cause of those feelings, the pudgala, which is fit to become karma-rupa, becomes transformed into karma-rupa, and when the pudgala dravya, which has become transformed into karma-rupa, gives its fruit, then by getting the cause of it, the jiva also undergoes transformation in the form of raga-adi. Although both the jiva and the pudgalik karma undergo transformation by getting the cause of each other, yet neither is the jiva the doer of the qualities of pudgala karma, nor is the pudgala karma the doer of the qualities of the jiva, but both undergo transformation by getting the cause of each other. Therefore, the soul is the doer of its own feelings, not the doer of all the feelings created by pudgala karma.

On the above statement, this doubt may arise that Jainism also considers the soul to be completely inactive like the purusha of Samkhya philosophy, and the pudgala to be the doer like prakriti. But this is not the case. The purusha of Samkhya philosophy is completely inactive, but in Jainism, the soul is not considered to be completely inactive. It is the doer of its own natural feelings - knowledge, perception, happiness, etc., and also of its own feelings - raga-dvesha, moha, etc., but it is not the doer of the transformation of karma-rupa in the pudgalas due to the cause of those feelings. The essence of the above statement is that in reality, only the proximate cause can be called the doer of anything, and the doership that is attributed to the remote cause is done from a practical, worldly point of view. What has been said about doership should also be understood about enjoyership. The one who is the doer of something can be the enjoyer of it, and the one who is the enjoyer of something can be the doer of it. 

Page #19:
---------------------------
(22) How can one be the enjoyer of that which has no doer? This is the two-fold explanation of Jain philosophy regarding the difference of opinion about doership and enjoyership. In reality, the soul is the doer and enjoyer of its own natural and unnatural emotions, but in practice, it is considered the enjoyer of the happiness, sorrow, etc. that it receives as a result of its own actions. In this context, it should also be clearly understood that Jain philosophy does not consider God to be the controller of creation, therefore, He does not have a hand in giving the fruits of karma. Karma gives its fruits itself. They do not need any other judges. Just as alcohol produces intoxication and milk gives strength. The person who drinks alcohol becomes unconscious and the person who drinks milk becomes strong. After drinking alcohol or milk, there is no need for another regulatory power to give its fruit. Similarly, the karma particles that are attracted towards the soul by every physical, verbal and mental pulsation of the living being and get bound in it by getting the opportunity of attachment and aversion, also have the power to do good or bad like alcohol and milk, which is expressed in relation to consciousness and shows its effect on it. The living being, fascinated by its effect, does such actions which are pleasant and painful for it. If the emotions of the living being are good at the time of doing karma, then the bound karma particles have a good effect and in due course of time, good fruits are obtained from it, and if the emotions are bad, then the effect is bad and in due course of time, the fruits are also bad. If God is considered to be the giver of fruits, then where one person kills another person, the killer should not be considered guilty, because the death of the person being killed by God is 

Page #20:
---------------------------
(23)

Punishes. Just as the king who punishes criminals through men, those men are not called criminals because they are following the king's orders. Similarly, the killer who kills someone is also causing them to experience the fruits of their past karma, because God must have ordained this punishment for their past karma, which is why they were killed. If it is said that man is free to act, and therefore the killer's act is not God-inspired but the result of his free will, then it must be said that in the state of the world, no being is truly free, all are bound by their own karma - "Karmaṇā badhyate jantu" (Mahabharata) and karma has an endless tradition. In such a situation, according to the principle of "Buddhi karmānusārīṇī" - that is, the intellect is according to karma, a person is not free to do or not do any work.

In this situation, it may be said that in such a state, no one will be able to attain liberation because the being is bound by karma and the being's intellect is according to karma. But it is not right to say so, because karma is both good and bad, therefore the intellect that follows good karma leads man towards the right path and the intellect that follows bad karma leads man towards the wrong path. Walking on the right path leads to liberation and walking on the wrong path leads to karma-bondage. In such a situation, the fact that the intellect is according to karma does not hinder liberation.

The freedom and dependence of the soul

It is generally said that the soul is free during the time of action and dependent during the time of experiencing the results. For example, if one eats poison, then... 

Page #21:
---------------------------
(24 24)
A human is free, they may eat or not eat, but after consuming poison, it is not in their hands to escape death. This is a gross example, because even after consuming poison, one can be cured and saved from death. Similarly, in the soul, both freedom and dependence are manifested in the two occasions of the agency and experience of karma. We explain this below.

The soul is free in the act of doing karma. It can create its own destiny as it wishes. By achieving complete victory over karma, it can become pure and liberated. But sometimes, due to past karma and external circumstances, it becomes so dependent that it can never do what it wants. For example, a soul may want to progress on the path of righteousness, but due to the force of karma, it does not gain strength on that path and slips. This is the freedom and dependence of the soul in the time of its agency.

It is not that the soul becomes dependent on karma after doing karma. Even in that situation, the soul's freedom is preserved. It can, if it wishes, transform the inauspicious into the auspicious, change the situation and taste, bring about the ripening of the fruits (vipak), and transform the ripening of the fruits into another form. In this, the soul's freedom is evident. Dependence is from this perspective, that the karma that has been taken on cannot be escaped without experiencing it. Even if the karma that is to be experienced for a long time is experienced in a short time, it must be experienced by all.

Types of Karma Experience
The experience of the fruits of karma by the living being is called the state of ripening of karma. In the state of ripening, the living being experiences the auspicious or inauspicious fruits of karma.

(It goes. This karma-udaya is of two types - (1) Pradesh-udaya and (2) Vipaka-udaya.
The karma whose fruition occurs only in the realms is called Pradesh-udaya, and the karma which gets destroyed after giving auspicious-inauspicious fruits is called Vipaka-udaya. The Vipaka-udaya of karma obstructs the qualities of the soul and contributes to the new karma-bandha. Whereas Pradesh-udaya does not have the capacity to bind new karma, nor does it cover the soul's qualities. Even when the soul's qualities are covered by karma, some parts of them always remain uncovered, which makes the soul's existence known. Even when the karma-avarana become dense, they do not have the capacity to make the soul non-soul, the conscious inert. The process of karma-kshaya
The Jain philosophy, like the binding and rising of karma, also has a process of karma-kshaya, which is complex and serious. When the situation is ripe, karma falls off after changing its form during the karma-udaya period. This is the natural decay of karma. In this, the flow of the tradition of karma is not destroyed. The previous karma is destroyed, but at the same time, the binding of new karma continues. This is not the real process of karma-kshaya. To destroy karma specifically, so that the soul can become free from karma, special efforts have to be made. These efforts are made through means like restraint, penance, renunciation, etc. Up to the seventh gunasthan called Aprammat-samyata, karma-kshaya takes place specifically through the said means, and after the attainment of the eighth Apurvakarana gunasthan, when the soul's power becomes mature, a special process takes place to destroy karma specifically. It is as follows - (1) Apurva-sthi-ghat (2) Apurva-rasa-dhat, (3) Guna-shreni, (4) Sankraman, (5) Apurva-sthi-bandha. 

Page #23:
---------------------------
The general discussion of the above five is as follows:

Firstly, the soul, through the process of *apravartanakaran*, establishes the *karmas* within the *antarmuhurt* and creates a *punashreni*. The establishment is as follows: Taking the time of *udayakal* as the starting point, the *karmas* are established in a sequential series within the *antarmuhurt*, excluding the initial *udayakal* time. The number of *karmas* established in the first time period is the least. The number of *karmas* established in the second time period is countless times more than those established in the first time period. The number of *karmas* established in the third time period is countless times more than those established in the second time period. This sequence should be understood until the final time period of the *antarmuhurt*. Since the number of *karmas* established in each time period is countless times more than the previous one, this is called *gunaveni*.

At this point, the soul binds very few *karmas*, unlike anything it has done before. Therefore, this state of binding is called *apuurva sthitibandh*. *Sthitighāt* and *rasghāt* are also *apuurva* at this time. In *gun-sampraman*, the *ashubh karmas* gradually transform into *shubh karmas*.

From the eighth *gunasthan* onwards, as the soul progresses, the *karmas* decay in greater quantities within shorter time periods.

In this state of *utkranti*, the progressing soul becomes ready to awaken the *parmatmashakti*. When the lifespan is short and the number of *karmas* is high, the *kevali samudhyāt* occurs to equalize the number of *karmas* with the duration of the lifespan. During this period of *samudhyāt*, the soul, with its own strength, defeats the more powerful *karmas* and weakens them. 

Page #24:
---------------------------
(20)
Their state and number remain the same as the number of Ayukarma. When this happens, the remaining karmas are destroyed along with the time-state of Ayukarma, and the soul becomes completely free from karma and attains Siddha-Buddhahood. This is the goal of the soul, and the success of the soul's effort in achieving it.
In this way, the theory of karma in Jainism has been scientifically explained. It has solved many tangled knots, revealed various mysteries, and awakened the enthusiasm for attaining freedom in the soul. It inspires faith in one's own efforts.
**Introduction to the Text**
The present text, called Shataka, is a karma text written by Shri Devendrasuri. It is the fifth karma text in the series of new karma texts. The previous four karma texts, namely (1) Karma Vipak, (2) Karmastava, (3) Bandhaswamitva, (4) Shadshasti, have already been published in this series. An introduction to them has been given in the preface of those karma texts. Here, in the same order, a brief introduction to this fifth karma text is being presented.
This fifth karma text explains which of the natures mentioned in the first karma text are Dhruvabandhini, Adhruvabandhini, Ababandhini, Dhavodaya, Avodaya, Sattaka, Adhrubasattaka, Sarvadeshghati, Aghati, Puny, Pap, Paravartaman, and Aparavartaman.
After that, it is explained which of those natures are Kshetravipaki, Jivavipaki, Bhavavipaki, and Pudgalavipaki.
Then, the nature of the four types of bondage, namely Prakritibandha, Sthitibandha, Rasabandha, and Pradeshbandha, is explained. In the context of the statement of Prakritibandha, the nature of Bhul and Uttar in Bhuyaskaar, 

Page #25:
---------------------------
(8)
The text enumerates the **alpatar**, **avasthit**, and **avaktvy** bonds. It explains the **sthitibandha** by describing the inferior and superior states of the **mula** and **uttara** natures, the method of deriving its evidence from the one-sensed beings, etc., and the description of the owners of the superior and inferior **sthitibandha**. It explains the **anubhag (ras) bandha** by describing the cause of the intense and mild **ras** in the auspicious and inauspicious natures, the special nature of the auspicious and inauspicious **ras**, the owners of the superior and inferior **anubhag bandha**, etc. It describes the **pradeshabandha** by explaining the nature of the **varganas**, their **avagahana**, the division of the **bandhakarmadalies** into **mula** and **uttara** natures, the eleven **gunashrenis** as the causes of **karmakshapana**, the nature of the **gunashreni** formation, the **gunasthanas**, and the superior interval. It also explains the nature of the **palyopam**, **sagaropama**, and **pulparavarta** distinctions, the owners of the superior and inferior **pradeshabandha**, the **yogasthanas**, etc., and the nature of the **loka**, etc., in brief.
Finally, it concludes the text by mentioning the **upshamani** and **kshanakoni**.

The basis for the composition of the fifth **karmagrantha** is, as mentioned earlier, that Shri Devendrasuri named his new **karmagranthas** based on the ancient **karmagranthas** and composed them based on them. Evidence for this is that at the beginning of the commentary on the fifth **karmagrantha**, Shri Devendrasuri remembers Shri Shivshamsuri, the author of the ancient **shataka**, and at the end, he writes that he composed this **shataka** based on the **karmaprakriti panchasangraha**, **vrihattaka**, etc. In addition, the main basis for its composition appears to be the **karmaprakriti** and **panchasangraha**. Because in its commentary, in many places, the **karmaprakriti chuni**, **karmaprakriti tika**, **panchasangraha**, etc., are mentioned as reference texts. 

Page #26:
---------------------------
(26)
And the Panchasangraha tika has been mentioned. Apart from these texts, no other texts have been mentioned specifically. The Panchasangraha has a clear imprint on many of the verses of the Shataka, in some places only a slight change is found. The author has first discussed the 36th verse of the Shataka according to the opinion of the Panchasangraha and then according to the opinion of the Karma Prakriti. There are some differences of opinion between the Karma Prakriti and the Panchasangraha. The opinion of the Karma Prakriti seems to be ancient, yet in some places the author of the Karmagrantha seems to be inclined towards the opinion of the Panchasangraha. Although he has given both opinions equal space in his text and has presented the Karma Prakriti as evidence in places, he has not refrained from giving the opinion of the Panchasangraha precedence in some places. Therefore, it must be said that he has composed the Shataka based on these two texts in particular.

In this way, some aspects of the Karma Siddhanta have been briefly illuminated in the form of a preface, outlining the text. A special study of the Karma literature in the light of these ideas can provide a good understanding of the Karma Siddhanta. Although the Karma literature appears monotonous to practitioners due to its seriousness, it is very easily understood if its study is gradually increased. For this, it is necessary to have an inquisitive attitude and an indomitable enthusiasm to keep practicing. It is hoped that the readers will study the Karmagrantha keeping the above points in mind.

## The Matak

The **Vishesharya-Gatha** has three parts: 1. Salutation, 2. Indication of the topics discussed in the text, and 3. Promise to discuss them. In other words, the author has indicated the scope of the text by offering a salutation and mentioning the topics to be discussed in this treatise on karma.

The phrase "**Namiy Jirna**" is a salutation to **Jineshwara Deva**. This is because Jineshwara Deva has conquered all karmas, whose bondage, manifestation, and existence remain in worldly beings until they attain liberation. This phrase also clarifies that regardless of the nature of karma, or the form of their fruition, their power is inferior to the power of the soul, the **Adhyatma**. The **Deva Vikasounmuni** soul inevitably conquers them. These karmas exert their influence only as long as the soul remains ignorant of its own power and is not progressing towards the goal of self-realization. However, as soon as the inner awakening, inspiration, enthusiasm, and self-perception arise, even the powerful karmas become subservient to the stream of their complete annihilation.

**Jineshwara Deva**, the conqueror of karma, conquers karmas that have attained the state of bondage, manifestation, and existence. However, due to the diversity of the results experienced by the soul, the karmas take on various forms like **Dhruva**, **Adhruva**, **Ghati**, **Aghati**, etc., which are called their states. Among these states, the phrase "**Dhuvabandhodayasattadhaipunnpariyatta**" mentions six states: **Dhruva Bandha**, **Dhruva Udaya**, **Dhruva Satya**, **Ghati**, **Punnya**, and **Paravartaman**. This is to understand the six opposing states by using the principle of **Seir Seitar**. 

Page #40:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma Granth

The term "Chajah Vivaaga" indicates that karmas have four types of vipaka states. This means that there are sixteen states of karma-natures, which Jinendra Dev conquered and attained the state of Jin. These are:

(1) Dhruva Bandhini, (2) Adhruva Bandhini, (3) Dhruvodaya, (4) Adhruvodaya, (5) Dhruva Sattak, (6) Adhruva Sattak, (7) Ghatini, (8) Adhatini, (9) Puny, (10) Pap, (11) Paravartmana, (12) Aparavartmana, (13) Kshetra Vipaki, (14) Jeeva Vidhaka, (15) Bhav Vipaki, (16) Pudgal Vipaki.

For these to have the state of udya and satta, it is necessary for them to be bound with the jeeva. As long as the jeeva is in the world, the connection of yoga and kshaya parinati remains, and thus karma-bandh occurs. Through yoga, karma-varganas are absorbed, and the nature of covering the atma-gunas is instilled in those karma-pudgalas. Through kshaya, the time limit for the karma to remain connected with the atma and the three aspects of phala-udaya, such as manda, are created. Thus, there are four types of karma-bandh: (1) Prakriti Bandh, (2) Sthiti Bandh, (3) Anubhag Bandh, (4) Pradesh Bandh.

The jeeva is the owner of these four types of vaidha bhedas. The jeeva creates the four aspects of prakriti, sthiti, etc., in the karma-varganas through its parinamas. Therefore, just as there are four types of karma-bandh, such as prakriti, sthiti bandh, etc., there are also owners of these, i.e., which jeeva is the owner of which prakriti, sthiti, anubhag, and pradesh bandh.

Thus, through the verses from "Namiy Jinam" to "Sami," it is clearly explained with reverence to the karma-vijeta Jinendra Dev.

## Century

As long as a living being is active and wandering in the world, it is bound by karmas in states like Dhruva Bandha, Adhruva Bandha, etc. It is called the owner of its mental, verbal, and physical tendencies and its passions - meaning it remains entitled to acquire karma.

But when it is prepared to eliminate karmas completely, it adopts one of two methods: either to suppress the arising of the essence of karma-mala or to completely destroy the essence of karma. Suppressing karma is called the Upshama श्रेणि (category), and destroying it is called the Kshapaka श्रेणि (category). The word 'Ya' in the verse indicates both these categories. Without ascending to the Upshama or Kshapaka श्रेणि, a living being cannot observe its true nature. It is another matter that a living being residing in the Upshama श्रेणि, upon the arising of karmas inherent in its being, becomes corrupted by the path of self-realization and returns to its previous state. But one who is in the Kshapaka श्रेणि, by destroying all obstacles, attains liberation from the infinite world through self-realization.

Thus, the verse indicates the karma-free soul, the path of karma-liberation, and the states of karma-binding, arising, etc., that occur in a worldly being. As long as a living being is in the world, it will be associated with many states of karma-natures. The only cause for liberation from these karmas is the self-transformation of the living being in the form of Upshama or Kshaya, and after karma-liberation, the soul attains the status of the Supreme Soul. Therefore, the topics discussed in the text are indicated in the verse as follows:

(1) Dhruva Bandhini, (2) Adhruva Bandhini, (3) Dhruva Udaya, (4) Adhruva... 

Page #42:
---------------------------
## The Five Karma Granthas:

(5) Dhruva Sattak, (6) Adhruva Sattak, (7) Dhatini, (8) Aghatini, (9) Puny, (10) Pap, (11) Paravartamana, (12) Aparavartamana, (13) Kshetravipaki, (14) Jeevavipaki, (15) Bhavavipaki, (16) Pudgalavipaki, (17) Prakrutibandh, (18) Sthitibandh, (19) Anubhagbandh, (20) Pradeshbandh, (21) Prakrutibandh Swami, (22) Sthitibandh Swami, (23) Anubhagbandh Swami, (24) Pradeshbandh Swami, (25) Upsham Shreni, (26) Kshapak Shreni.

The definitions of the six topics mentioned in the gatha are as follows:

(1) **Dhruva Bandhini Prakruti:** The karma prakruti that is bound inevitably due to its cause is called Dhruva Bandhini Prakruti. Such a prakruti binds every being at all times until its binding is severed.

(2) **Adhruva Bandhini Prakruti:** The prakruti that binds and also does not bind due to the causes of its binding is called Adhruva Bandhini Prakruti. Such a prakruti binds and also does not bind until its binding is severed.

**A similar instruction from the Karma Grantha is found in the Panchamangrah as follows:**

"Dhruvodaya sambandhayi pariyattamana asubhao.
Pachvi savishkha pagai va vivaago chaha." (3.14)

This gatha indicates the five opposites of Dhruva Bandhi, Dhruvodaya, Sarvaghati, Paravartamana, and Mor Ashum, as well as the four types of vipaks.

In total, there are fourteen names.

**From the Panchasangrah (3.35):**

"Niyaheusanbhavevi hu bhayanikho jaan hoi paythiinam.
Bacho ta adhuwao dhoosha abhanibandhaao."

This indicates that the Adhruva Bandhini Prakruti is difficult to understand.

## Translation:

**Shataka**

The Dhruvabandhini nature remains bound to the living being at all times until the time of its liberation, while the Anubandhini nature is not bound at all times, even until the time of its liberation. Here, the term "Dhruvabandhini" and "Anubandhini" refers to the general cause of bondage, not the specific cause. Because, the specific causes of bondage for each nature, when present, will inevitably lead to the bondage of that nature, even if it is Adhruvabandhini. Therefore, the nature that is bound or not bound despite the presence of its general cause of bondage is Adhruvabandhini, and the nature that is inevitably bound is Dhruvabandhini.

**(3) Kosa Nature:** The nature whose emergence is continuous, meaning the nature that continuously emerges without interruption for the living being until the time of its emergence, is called Dhruvodaya.

**(4) Anuvoda Nature:** The nature whose emergence is not continuous until the end of its emergence period, sometimes emerges and sometimes does not, meaning the nature whose emergence does not follow a rule even until the time of its liberation, is called Anuvodaya nature.

The five causes of emergence for all Karma natures, from general to specific, are: Dravya, Kshetra, Kala, Bhav, and Bhav. The emergence of all Karma natures occurs due to the combination of these five. The same type of Dravya, etc., does not cause the emergence of all Karma natures, but different types of Dravya, etc., act as causes. Some Dravya, etc., material causes the emergence of a particular nature, while others do not. 

**Note:** The text includes a quote from the Panchasangrah (3/37) which states: "The continuous emergence is known as Dhruvodaya. The emergence that is not continuous is known as Adhruvodaya." 

Page #44:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma Granth

**Cause and Effect:**

In the Fifth Karma Granth, there is a cause and a material that acts as a catalyst for its emergence. However, it is certain that wherever there is a single cause of emergence, all other causes are present in a group form.

**(5) Dhruvasattaka Prakriti:** The nature of the eternal, non-real (mithyatva) Jiva, which is constantly in existence and always present, is called Dhruvasattaka Prakriti.

**(6) Adhruvasattaka Prakriti:** The nature whose existence is not governed by any rule, meaning it may exist at one time and not at another, is called Adhruvasattaka Prakriti. Dhruvasattaka Prakritis are present in every Jiva at all times until the time of liberation (vichched kal), while Adhruvasattaka Prakritis do not have this rule.

**(7) Ghatiini Prakriti:** The Karma Prakriti that destroys the spiritual qualities (Jnana, etc.) is called Ghatiini Prakriti. It is of two types: Sarvaghatiini and Deshaghatiini. The Karma Prakriti that completely destroys its object (Jnana, etc.) is called Sarvaghatiini, and the one that destroys a part of its object is called Deshaghatiini.

Some Karma Prakritis are Sarvaghatiini-participatory, meaning they do not have the power to suppress Jnana, etc., within themselves, but they reveal their extremely terrible consequences due to their association with Sarvaghatiini Prakritis. They are experienced along with Sarvaghatiini Prakritis.

(8) **Aghātini Prakṛti** - A nature that does not destroy spiritual qualities is called Aghātini Prakṛti. 
(6) **Puṣpa Prakṛti** - A nature whose result is auspicious is called Puṇya Prakṛti.
(10) **Pāpa Prakṛti** - A nature whose result is inauspicious is called Pāpa Prakṛti.
(11) **Pāravartmānā Prakṛti** - A nature that binds, arises, or both, by stopping the binding, arising, or both of another nature, is called Pāravartmānā Prakṛti.
(12) **Aparāvartmānā Prakṛti** - A nature that binds, arises, or both, without stopping the binding, arising, or both of another nature, is called Aparāvartmānā Prakṛti.
(13) **Kṣetravipāko Prakṛti** - When a being leaves one body and takes on a new body in a new state of existence, the karma nature that arises in the state of disintegration and experiences its fruit is called Kṣetravipāko Prakṛti. This nature arises only during the interval between leaving one state and entering another, not at other times. Therefore, it is called Kṣetravipāko Prakṛti.
(14) **Jīvaṣipāko Prakṛti** - A nature that bears its fruit within the being itself is called Jīvaṣipāko Prakṛti. The fruit of this nature...

##  Translation:

**Bam Kamenya**

The nature that causes the experience of its fruits through the qualities of knowledge, etc., directly to the soul, whether it has a body or not, and whatever the state or realm may be, is called **Jiva-vipaki** nature.

**(15) Bhava-vipaki Nature:** The nature that bears fruit only in the state of human, hell, etc., is called **Bhava-vipaki** nature. The reason for this is that even after two parts of the present lifespan have passed, and the soul is bound in the third or subsequent part, this nature does not manifest until the previous state is destroyed and a suitable future state is attained. Therefore, it is called **Bhava-vipaki** nature.

**(16) Pudgala-vipaki Nature:** The karma nature that is about to bear fruit in the **pudgala** (matter), i.e., the nature whose fruit is experienced by the soul through the **pudgala**, is called **Pudgala-vipaki** nature. The karma nature that manifests its power in the **pudgalas** taken up by the **audarika** (material) etc., **namakarma** (name karma), is called **Pudgala-vipaki** nature. In other words, the nature that bears its fruit in the **pudgala** atoms that have transformed into the form of the body is called **Pudgala-vipaki** nature.

These are the definitions of the sixteen **prakriti** (natures) mentioned here. The explanations of the remaining ten **prakriti** (natures), such as **sthiti** (state), etc., are given in their respective places in the first and second **karmagrantha** (karma texts). Therefore, we now begin the narration of the topics of the text in order, starting with the following verses.

**Prabhandhi Prakritiyaan**

First, we will list the number and names of the **dhruva-bandhini** (fixed-binding) **prakriti** (natures) in order:

**Vannachauteyakammagurulahu Nimanoshghay Mayakuchcha. Micchakasaayavarana Vigdha Shuvadi Samavatta. ||2||**

**Special Note:**

* The verse mentions the names of the fixed karmic tendencies.
* These are the karmic tendencies that bind when their respective causes are present.
* The eight fundamental karmic tendencies are:
    1. Knowledge covering
    2. Perception covering
    3. Vedaniya (feeling)
    4. Mohaniya (delusion)
    5. Ayu (life span)
    6. Name
    7. Gotra (family)
    8. Antaray (internal obstacles)
* These have their respective binding tendencies, totaling 120.
* Out of these 120, 47 are fixed, and their names are:
    1. Knowledge covering: Mati, Shrauta, Avadhi, Manaparyaya, and Kevala
    2. Perception covering: Chakshu, Achakshu, Avadhi, Kevala, Nidra, Nidra-Nidra, Prachala, Prachala-Prachala, and Styanadhi

## Fifth Karma-Prati (Karma-Types)

**(4) Maamakarma:**  Color, smell, taste, touch, tejas (radiance) body, karman (action) body, aguru-laghu (heavy-light), creation, and destruction.

**(5) Bhansaraaya:** Giving, receiving, enjoyment, consumption, and obstruction of viriya (energy).

It is clear from the above mentioned types that all the **uttar-prakritis** (consequences) of **jnana-avaran** (knowledge-obscuring), **darshan-avaran** (perception-obscuring), and **antaraya** (obstruction) karma, which have five, nine, and five consequences respectively, are **dhruva-bandhini** (permanently binding).  The **mithya-tva** (false belief) of **darshan-moha** (perception-delusion) and the eighteen **prakritis** (consequences) of **charitra-moha** (conduct-delusion) and the nine **prakritis** of **nama-karma** (name-karma) are **dhruva-bandhini**. Thus, five **prakritis** of **jnana-avaran**, nine of **darshan-avaran**, sixteen of **mohaniya** (delusive), nine of **nama**, and five of **antaraya**, totaling forty-seven **prakritis** are **dhruva-bandhini**. The reason for these **prakritis** being **dhruva-bandhini** is explained according to the order mentioned in the verse.

The reason for considering the nine **prakritis** of **nama-karma**, namely color, smell, taste, touch, tejas, karman, aguru-laghu, creation, and destruction, as **dhruva-bandhini** is that the **tejas** and **karman** bodies are present in all beings of the four **gatis** (states of existence). They are connected from the beginning of time. Even during the **vi-graha-gati** (interval motion) between leaving one gross body and taking another in a different **bhaava** (existence), the **tejas** and **karman** bodies remain. When either an **oudarik** (gross) or **vaikriya** (subtle) body is bound, **nama-karma** like color, smell, taste, and touch are inevitably bound. When an **oudarik** or **vaikriya** body is bound, it is created from **pudgalas** (matter) suitable for it. Therefore, the binding of **nirman** (creation) **nama-karma** is also inevitable. Due to the presence of these **oudarik** and **vaikriya** bodies, **upghat** (destruction) occurs from other gross substances. **Oudarik** or **vaikriya** bodies attract **varna** (color) etc. suitable for them.

**Shanak**

They also accept, but those who accept do not appear to be as heavy as iron or as light as cotton wool. They always remain in a very small form. Therefore, the nine natures of karma are called Dhruvabandhini because they are bound to be bound when their causes are present. Their bondage occurs until the end of the eighth Gunasthan, called Aapuurvakaran.

Fear and disgust are the natures of Charitna Mohaniya. There is no opponent to their bondage. Therefore, these two are considered Dhruvabandhini natures. These two natures remain bound until the end of the eighth Gunasthan due to the presence of their binding causes. Mithyatva is bound to be bound in the emergence of Mithyatva Mohaniya. Since Mithyatva Mohaniya continuously emerges until the Gunasthan of Mithyatva, Mithyatva is continuously bound. Mithyatva is not bound in the Gunasthan beyond the Gunasthan of Mithyatva.

The sixteen Kashayas, namely Anantanubandhi Krodha, Mana, Maya, Lobha, Apratyakhyanavaran, Krodha, Mana, Maya, Lobha, Pratyakhyanavaran, Krodha, Mana, Maya, Lobha, and Sanjwalan Krodha, Mana, Maya, Lobha, are bound to be bound until their respective causes of emergence are present. Therefore, these sixteen Kashayas are considered Dhruvabandhini natures.

The five natures of Jnanavaran, the nine natures of Darshanavaran, and the five natures of Antaraya, these nineteen natures are bound to be bound until their respective places of bondage and liberation. Since there are no other opposing natures for them, they are considered Dhruvabandhini natures.

The sixteen Kashayas of Anantanubandhi Krodha, Mana, etc., and the nineteen natures of Jnanavaran, Darshanavaran, and Antaraya karma are Dhruvabandhini. 

Page #50:
---------------------------
## Fifth Karma-Pratikraman

This is a detailed explanation of the special rules for the binding of karma-pratikraman. The general rule for the binding of karma-pratikraman is that, out of the four binding factors - Mithyatva, Adhirat, Kshaya, and Yoga - whichever factor is present, and 'Je Bae'i Te Bandhai' - whichever nature arises to that particular Gunasthan, the binding of that nature is certain.

Therefore, the binding of the seven natures - the four Ananta-Anubandhi Kshayas and the five Sthana-Naddhinik - is due to the Atma-Parinam caused by the arising of the Ananta-Anubandhi Kshayas. These arise up to the second Sasadan Gunasthan. Beyond that, the absence of Atma-Parinam caused by the arising of Ananta-Anubandhi Kshayas prevents further binding.

Similarly, the binding of the four Apratyakhyana-Avarana Kshayas occurs up to the fourth Aviriti Samyagdrishti Gunasthan. Beyond that, the absence of any such Atma-Parinam prevents further binding. The binding of the four Prayapika-Avarana Kshayas occurs up to the fifth Deshaviriti Gunasthan. The binding of Nidra and Prachala occurs up to the first moment of the eighth Apurvakaran Gunasthan. Beyond that, the impossibility of further binding-worthy results prevents further binding.

The binding of Sanjwalan Krodha, Mana, Maya, and Lobha occurs up to the Badar Samparaya Gunasthan. This is because the arising of the Badar Kshaya is the cause of their binding. This arises only up to the ninth Gunasthan, not beyond.

The binding of the fourteen natures - five Jnana-Avarana, four Darshan-Avarana, and five Antaraya - occurs up to the last moment of the tenth Sukshma-Samparaya Gunasthan. This is because the Kshaya that is the cause of their binding arises only up to this Gunasthan, not beyond.

In this way, the forty-nine natures - five Jnana-Avarana, nine Darshan-Avarana, nineteen Mohaniya, nine Nama-Karma, and five Antaraya - are bound...

**Satak**

The five natures of the Rāya are combined. Due to the presence of Mithyatva, Aviriti, Kṣaya, and other causes, all beings are inevitably bound. Therefore, these are considered Dhruvabandhini Natures.

In Digambar literature, two types of Adhruvbandhini Prakruti are mentioned - Sapratipakshi and Apratipakshi. The names of the Prakruti included in these are as follows:

**Sese Tistaharang Parghaadachoukk Sab Aani. Appati Dakkha Sesa Sappdibkya Hai Vasatthi.**

- Gor Kamekar 125. Tirthankara, Aharakadvik, Paraghat, Atap, Udyot, Ucchvas, four Ayus - these eleven Prakruti are Apratipakshi. This means they do not have any Nirodhini Prakruti. However, their bandh occurs in some specific situations, hence they are called Adhruvbandhini. The remaining sixty-two Prakruti are considered Matra Madhini because they are Sapratipakshi.

## The Fifth Chapter of the Granth

The reason for considering these as **Adhruvbandhini** (non-permanent binding) is that even though the general causes of binding are present, their binding does not occur regularly. It means sometimes they bind and sometimes they don't. The reason for these natures not binding regularly is that some of these natures do not bind because their opposing natures take their place, and some natures bind sometimes and sometimes not due to their inherent characteristics. _Explain the reason for considering these **Sihrar** (fluctuating) natures as **Sanvandin** (related) with reasons._

Among the five types of **Sharira** (body) **Namakarma** (karmic actions), **Tanjas** and **Kaman** **Sharira** are considered **Dhruvbandhini** (permanent binding) natures due to their eternal connection with **Samari** (sentient beings). The remaining three **Sharira** - **Audarik**, **Bainkriya**, and **Aharak** - and the three types of **Angopang** (limbs and organs) **Namakarma** with the same names, only one **Sharira** and one **Angopang** bind to a being at a time; not the other. Because they are mutually opposing, the binding of one prevents the binding of the other. Therefore, these are considered **Adhruvbandhini**.

The six **Sansthan** (abodes) like **Samchaturasra** (square) are also mutually opposing in tradition. If the **Sansthan** of the body - the shape - is square due to **Karma**, then the binding of other **Sansthan** cannot arise in it. Therefore, they are also included in the **Adhruvbandhini** natures.

The binding of **Manushya** (human) and **Tiryanch** (animal) **Prayogya** (capable of experiencing) natures results in the binding of only one of the six **Sanhanan** (combinations) at a time - **Vajra**, **Rishabha**, **Nag**, **Cha** etc. However, when **Dev** (divine) and **Narak** (hellish) **Prayogya** natures bind, none of the **Sanhanan** bind. Therefore, **Sanhanan** **Namakarma** is **Adhruvbandhi** (non-permanently binding).

---------------------------
## Chapter 100

The five **jati** (castes) from **ekendriya** (one-sense) to **panchendriya** (five-sense), and the four **gati** (paths) from **devagati** (heavenly path) to **narakagati** (hellish path), are called **adhruvabandhini** (non-fixed) because only one **jati** and one **gati** are bound at a time. Similarly, **gubha** (good) or **ashubha** (bad) **vihayogati** (path of liberation) and the four **anupurvi** (consequences) from **devanupurvi** (heavenly consequence) are also **adhruvabandhini** because only one of them is bound at a time.

The thirty-three **prakriti** (natures) from **oudarik** (generous) to **anupurvi** (consequence) are **adhruvabandhini** because they are bound with their respective **pratipakshini** (opposite) and **virodhini** (contradictory) **prakriti**.

The **tirthankara** (liberated soul) **namakarma** (karma) is bound relative to **samyaktv** (right faith), but it is not necessary that it is bound when **samyaktv** is present. It is bound for some and not for others even when **samyaktv** is present. Therefore, it is **adhruvabandhini**.

The **namakarma** of **uccvas** (exhalation) is bound when **paryaptak** (sufficient) and **prayogya** (applicable) **prakriti** are bound, but not when **aparyaptak** (insufficient) and **prayogya** **prakriti** are bound. The **namakarma** of **udyot** (illumination) is bound for some and not for others when **tiryanch** (animal) and **prayogya** **prakriti** are bound. Therefore, **uccvas** and **udyot** **namakarma** are **adhruvabandhini**.

The **namakarma** of **atap** (heat) is bound for some and not for others when **prithvikaayik** (earthly) and **prayogya** **prakriti** are bound. Therefore, it is **adhruvabandhini**. The **namakarma** of **paraghat** (destruction) is bound for some when **paryaptak** and **prayogya** **prakriti** are bound, but it is not bound for anyone when **aparyaptak** and **prayogya** **prakriti** are bound. Therefore, it is **adhruvabandhini**. 

Page #56:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karmagrantha

The Basdashak and Stavardashak, totaling twenty natures, are mutually antagonistic and bind themselves when their respective eligible natures bind. Therefore, they are considered Adhruvbandhini natures.

High Gotra and Low Gotra are mutually antagonistic natures. When a High Gotra binds, a Low Gotra does not bind, and vice versa. Therefore, both are called Adhruvbandho. Similarly, Saata Vedaniya and Asaata Vedaniya are also mutually antagonistic, making them Adhruvbandhini natures.

While considering Gotra Karma and Vedaniya Karma as Adhruvbandhini natures, it is also important to understand that Saata and Asaata Vedaniya are Adhruvbandhi only up to the sixth Gunasthan. However, after the Asaata Vedaniya is liberated in the sixth Gunasthan, the Saata Vedaniya Karma becomes Dhruvbandhi in the seventh and subsequent Gunasthanas. Similarly, High Gotra and Low Gotra are Adhruvbandhi up to the second Gunasthan. However, after the Low Gotra is liberated in the second Gunasthan, the High Gotra becomes Dhruvbandhi in the subsequent Gunasthanas.

The two pairs of Mohaniya Karma, namely Haasya-Rati and Shoka-Arati, are Adhruvbandhini. This is because these two pairs are mutually antagonistic. When the Haasya-Rati pair binds, the Shoka-Arati pair does not bind, and vice versa. 

**Note:** For the natures that are eligible to bind and liberate in each Gunasthan, refer to the second Karmagrantha, verses 4 to 12. 

Page #57:
---------------------------
## Shataka

At the time of the binding of the Arati couple, the binding of the Hasya-Rati couple is not possible. These four natures have a separate binding.

However, it should be kept in mind that Hasya, Rati, Arati, and Shoka, these four natures are only bound in the first five Ganasthana. In the sixth Ganasthana, after the liberation of Shoka and Arati, the continuous binding of Hasya and Rati occurs, making them Dhruvabandi.

Out of the three Vedas, Stri Veda, Purusha Veda, and Napunsaka Veda, only one Veda is bound at a time. Compared to Gunasthana, Napunsaka Veda is bound in the first Gunasthana, Stri Veda is bound until the second Gunasthana. After that, Purusha Veda is bound in the subsequent Gunasthana.

Out of the four types of Ayukarma, Devayau, Manushayau, Tithanchayau, and Narakayau, only one Ayukarma is bound in one Bhava. Therefore, they are called Adhruvabandi.

Thus, seventy-three natures should be understood as Adhruvabandi. These include two Vedaniya, seven Mohaniya, four Aamukarma, forty-eight Naam Karma, and two Golakarma natures. Out of the 120 bindable natures, 47 are Dhruvabandi and 73 are Adhruvabandi. The total of 47 and 73 is 120.

The binding, liberation of natures, their Anaavi-Anant, etc. are explained in detail in the Granthalaghav.

From the perspective of Granthalaghav, instead of mentioning the names of Dhruvodaya and Adhruvodaya natures, we will explain the number of stages of Karmabandha and Karmaudaya. To address this curiosity, we will first explain the Bhangas. The names of the Bhangas of binding are the same as the Bhangas of liberation. 

Page #58:
---------------------------
## Chapter 21: The Fifth Karma Text

The names of the four types of **bhang** (breaking) will be given here. This is because, just as it is necessary to explain the ten stages of **bandha** (binding) due to the **dhruvabandhini** (fixed) nature of **karma** (actions), it is also necessary to explain the stages of **udaya** (emergence) after mentioning the number of **dhruvodaya** (fixed emergence) and **anuvodaya** (variable emergence) natures. Therefore, according to the **Madhyamakaradipa** (middle path) logic, the names of the **bhang** that occur in the **bandha** and **udaya** states are given here. That is, the **bhang** mentioned here should be applied to both **bandha** and **udaya**. The names of these **bhang** are:

1. **Anadi Anant** (infinite from beginningless time)
2. **Anadi Sant** (finite from beginningless time)
3. **Sadi Anant** (infinite from a beginning)
4. **Sadi Sant** (finite from a beginning)

These four **bhang** occur in both **bandha** and **udaya**.

The characteristics of these **bhang** are as follows:

**(1) Anadi Anant:** The **bandha** or **udaya** whose flow has been uninterrupted from beginningless time, neither broken in the middle nor in the future, is called **Anadi Anant**. Such **bandha** or **udaya** occurs in **abhavya** (non-liberated) beings.

**(2) Anadi Sant:** The **bandha** or **udaya** whose flow has been uninterrupted from beginningless time, but will end in the future, is called **Anadi Sant**. Such **bandha** or **udaya** occurs in **bhavya** (liberated) beings.

**(3) Sadi Anant:** The **bandha** or **udaya** whose flow has begun at a specific point in time and continues uninterruptedly, is called **Sadi Anant**. Such **bandha** or **udaya** occurs in beings who have fallen from the **upshanta moha** (calm passion) **gunasthan** (spiritual state).

**(4) Sadi Sant:** The **bandha** or **udaya** whose flow has begun at a specific point in time and will end in the future, is called **Sadi Sant**. Such **bandha** or **udaya** occurs in beings who have fallen from the **upshanta moha** (calm passion) **gunasthan** (spiritual state).

**Note:** The **Panchasangraha** (Five Collections) mentions only three **bhang** because the **Sadi Anant** **bhang** is not a possible alternative. 

**The verse:**

"There are three types of **bandha**: **Anadi Anant**, **Anadi Sant**, and **Sadi Sant**. **Abhavya** beings have **Anadi Anant** **bandha**, **bhavya** beings have **Anadi Sant** **bandha**, and beings who have fallen from the **upshanta moha** **gunasthan** have **Sadi Sant** **bandha." 

Page #59:
---------------------------

If it is interrupted, it is called Anadi Sant. This happens to the Bhavy.
(3) Sabit - Which is infinite with the beginning. But this break does not occur in any bondage or arising nature. Because whatever bondage or arising is with the beginning can never be infinite. Therefore, this option is not considered acceptable.
(4) Savi Sant - The bondage or arising which stops in the middle and starts again and does not become continuous, that bondage or arising is called Sadi Sant. This is found in the beings who have fallen from the Upaśānta Moh Gunasthāna.
Gatak
Thus, after explaining the nature of the four breaks, in the next verse, the said breaks are reduced in the bondage and arising natures.
Taiyajjabhangatigam.
Pathamaviya Dhuvajvaisu Buvbandhisu Mishthammi Timmi Bhangaa Duhaavi Aghuya Turiabhangaa ||15||
Shabdarth - Padamviya first and second break, Dhubauvahasunavodayi natures in Dhuvbandhi - Dhruvbandhinam natures, Tahaavjam - except the third break, Sangatigam - there are three breaks, Micchhami - in Mithyatva, Timni - three, Manga - break Duhaavi - both types of Adhwa Adhruvbandhini and Anushodya, Turiranga - fourth break.

Gavaarth - In Dhruvodayi natures, there is the first and second break. In Dhruv-bandhini natures, except for the third break

## The Fifth Karma Granth

This text discusses the three types of "bhang" (divisions) within "mithyatva" (false belief) and the fourth "bhang" found in both types of "adhruva" (non-permanent) natures. 

Previously, the four "bhangs" - "anadi-ananta" (beginningless-endless), "anadi-santa" (beginningless-limited), "sadi-ananta" (beginningful-endless), and "sadi-santa" (beginningful-limited) - were only mentioned by name. Here, we clarify which "bhang" applies to "dhruvabandi" (permanent) and other natures.

These "bhangs" occur in "dhruva" (permanent), "adhruva" (non-permanent) "bandha" (bondage), and "udaya" (arising) natures. The names of "dhruvabandi" and "adhruvabandi" natures have already been mentioned, and the names of "dhruvodayi" (permanent arising) and "adhruvodayi" (non-permanent arising) natures will be explained in the following verses. However, for the sake of brevity and to avoid repetition, we will mention the "bhangs" occurring in both "bandha" and "udaya" natures together.

Firstly, the verse "padhamavia dhruvudaimu pad" states that the first "bhang" in "dhruvodayi" natures is "anadi-ananta" and the second is "anadi-santa." This is because "abhavya" (non-liberated beings) never experience the arising of "dhruvodayi" natures. Therefore, the first "bhang" is considered "anadi-ananta."  "Bhavya" (liberated beings) experience arising from the beginningless, but their arising ceases in the twelfth or thirteenth "gunasthan" (stages of spiritual progress). This is why the second "bhang" in "dhruvodayi" natures is considered "anadi-santa."

We have explained the first and second "bhangs" in "dhruvodayi" natures. However, "mithyatva" (false belief), being a characteristic of "mohaniya karma" (delusion-causing karma), has three "bhangs" - "anadi-ananta," "anadi-santa," and "sadi-santa." These "bhangs" occur as follows: "abhavya" experience the arising of "mithyatva" from the beginningless, and it never ceases. Therefore, it is considered "anadi-ananta."

---------------------------
**The Sangha**

There are four types of **bhang** (cessation of bondage). The first is **anadi-ananta** (beginningless and endless), which means the bondage is beginningless and will never cease. The second is **anadi-santa** (beginningless and finite), which means the bondage is beginningless but will eventually cease. The third is **sadi-santa** (finite and finite), which means the bondage is finite and will eventually cease. The fourth is **sadi-ananta** (finite and endless), which means the bondage is finite but will never cease.

The **anadi-ananta** bhang occurs in the case of a **bhavya** (liberable soul) who has never attained **samyaktv** (right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct). The **anadi-santa** bhang occurs in the case of a **bhavya** who has attained **samyaktv** but has lost it and regained it again. The **sadi-santa** bhang occurs in the case of a **bhavya** who has attained **samyaktv** and has lost it again. The **sadi-ananta** bhang occurs in the case of a **bhavya** who has attained **samyaktv** and has lost it again, but will never regain it.

Samvarga Ty
Sadi and Sant bhang occur. Because their bandha, uday are adhruva, sometimes they occur and sometimes they don't. Due to adhruvata, their bandha and uday have both an adi and an ant.
25
In Go. Karmakanda, while describing prakritibandha, four types of bandha are mentioned. Sadi, Anadi, Dhruva and Adhruva. Their characteristics are as follows:
Saavi abandhabandhe se anavage
Anadi hu.
1
Abhayavasihi ghuso marvasa addha vo bandho || 122 ||
The bandha of a karma which is absent and then binds again is called Sadi bandha. The anadi bandha of the prakriti of a jiva who has not stepped on the 'shreni' is anadi bandha. Abhavya jivas have dhruva bandha and bhavya jivas have adhruva bandha.
Here, the words dhruva and adhruva mean anant and sant respectively. Because the bandha of an abhavya is anant and the bandha of a bhavya is sant.
Dhruvabandhini 47 prakritis have the above mentioned types of bandha and the remaining 73 adhruvabandhini prakritis have sadi and anadi, these two bandhas.
In Karmagranth, three bhangs are mentioned for dhruvabandhini prakritis and in Go. Karmakanda, four bhangs are mentioned. But there is no difference in opinion. Because in Karmagranth, the statement is made about sangyogi bhangs and in Go. Karmakanda, about each asangyogi bhang, like anadi, dhruva. Therefore,
1
1 The gunaasthan beyond which the bandha of a karma occurs is called shreni here. 

Page #63:
---------------------------
The Sataka (a Jain text) mentions three types of bhang (destruction) for sadi-ananta (infinite) karma, while the Go-Karmakanda (another Jain text) mentions four types of bhang for each. Similarly, the Sataka mentions one type of bhang for adhruvabandhini (non-permanent) karma, while the Go-Karmakanda mentions two types of bhang. However, there is no real difference. Combining sadi and adhruv (or sant) results in the sadi-sant bhang, while counting them separately makes them two. There is uniformity among the Karmagranthik (Jain scholars) regarding the bhang of prakritibandh (nature-binding), but the difference in style of expression creates an apparent difference.

Therefore, one should know the order of bhang for anadi-ananta (infinite) karma in bandh (binding) and uday (arising) prakritis. This is a general statement. The specific statement will be made in its place after mentioning the names of dhruvodayi (permanent arising) and adhruvodayi (non-permanent arising) prakritis.

Now, in the following verse, we will mention the names of dhruvodayi prakritis. The dhruvodayi prakritis are:

Nimina (creation karma), Thira (stable karma), Athira (unstable karma), Aguruya (heavy karma), Suha (auspicious karma), Asuha (inauspicious karma), Tey (tejas body), Kamma (form body), Chavana (four types of varna), Nanantaram (knowledge-obscuring karma), Dasan (four types of darsana-obscuring karma), Mischa (false belief karma), Dhruvodaya (five types of nodani karma), Sagobisa (twenty-seven types of karma).

## The Fifth Karma Granth

"The five karma granths, namely, **Gayaarp-nirman**, **sthira**, **asthira**, **agurulghu**, **shubha**, **ashubha**, **tanjas karman sharira**, **varna chatushk**, **five jnana avaran**, **five antaraya**, **four darshan avaran**, and **mithyatva mohaniya**, are the twenty-seven **dhruvodaya** natures."

**Special Meaning:** This verse lists the twenty-seven **dhruvodaya** natures. They are called **dhruvodaya** because their existence remains constant until their time of rise and fall.

There are 122 **udayoyoga** natures for the eight karmas, namely, **jnana avaran** (5), **darshan avaran** (2), **vedaniya** (2), **mohaniya** (28), **ayu** (4), **nama** (67), **gotra** (2), and **antaraya** (5). Thus, there are 5 + 2 + 2 + 4 + 67 + 2 + 5 = 122 natures. Out of these, 27 are **dhruvodaya**. Their details are as follows:

(1) **Jnana Avaran:** **mati**, **shruta**, **avadhi**, **manparyaya**, **kevala jnana avaran**.
(2) **Darshan Avaran:** **chakshu**, **achakshu**, **avadhi**, **kevala darshan avaran**.
(3) **Mohaniya:** **mithyatva**.

(a) "**Nimmanadhirapirateyakammaranar agurumahamumuham. Nanantarayadasagan sanchan miccha nicchadaya.**" - Panchasangrah 3.16

(b) "In the **Karmakand** of the **Go**, the **dhruvodaya** natures are described in the context of counting the **udayashbandhini** natures... **Misal sahamass ghadiyo. Nejagam vanchaom thinmrigajugalagurunimin dhuvudaya.**" - Go Karmakand, verses 402, 403. 

Page #65:
---------------------------
## Shataka (5)

**Name Karma:** Creation, Stable, Unstable, Heavy-Light, Auspicious, Inauspicious, Tejas Body, Karman Body, Color, Smell, Taste, Touch.

**15) Obstacles:** Giving, Gain, Enjoyment, Consumption, Semen Obstacles.

These are discussed in the order of the verses. The twelve aspects of Name Karma - Creation, Stable, Unstable, Heavy-Light, Auspicious, Inauspicious, Tejas, Karman, and the four aspects of Color - are considered **Dhruvodaka** (ever-present) because their manifestation is always present in the beings bound by the **Pasha** (bondage). As long as there is a body, their manifestation will continue. At the end of the thirteenth **Munasthan** (stage of spiritual progress), the manifestation of these twelve aspects ceases, but until then, all beings experience their manifestation.

Although the four aspects of Stable, Unstable, Auspicious, and Inauspicious are considered **opposite** to each other, this opposition is in relation to **bondage**. Because, during the time of Stable Name Karma, Unstable Name Karma cannot be bound, and during the time of Auspicious Name Karma, Inauspicious Name Karma cannot be bound. However, there is no opposition in relation to **manifestation**. Stable and Unstable can manifest simultaneously. Because, due to the manifestation of Stable Name Karma, bones, teeth, etc. become stable, and due to the manifestation of Unstable Name Karma, blood, etc. become unstable. Similarly, due to the manifestation of Auspicious Name Karma, the head, etc. become auspicious limbs, and due to the manifestation of Inauspicious Name Karma, the feet, etc. become inauspicious limbs. Therefore, although these four aspects are considered opposite in relation to bondage, they are considered non-opposite in relation to manifestation.

The five **Gnanavarana** (knowledge obscurations), five **Antaraya** (obstacles), and four **Darshanavarana** (perception obscurations) - these fourteen aspects continue to manifest until their destruction at their respective **Gunasthan** (stage of spiritual progress). Their destruction occurs at the culmination of the twelfth **Gunasthan**. Therefore, they are called **Naanantarapa Dasan Chal O Sajogi Vayala** (the fourteen aspects that are not destroyed until the twelfth Gunasthan). - **Second Karmagrantha, Verse 20** 

Page #66:
---------------------------
The fifth karma granth is called Dhruvodaya. The Mohaniya karma, with the Mithyatva prakriti, arises and ceases at the end of the first Mithyatva gunasthan. Therefore, the arising of Mithyatva is Dhruva until the first Mithyatva gunasthan. This is why it is called Dhruvodaya prakriti.

Thus, according to the order of the verses, there are 12 Dhruvodaya prakritis for Namakarma, 5 for Jnanavarana, 5 for Antaraya, 4 for Darshanavarana, and 1 for Mohaniya, totaling 27 Dhruvodaya prakritis. Now, in the next verse, the names of the Adhruvodaya prakritis are mentioned:

**Verse 7:**

**Word Meaning:**

* Ghir-Mubhier - Stable, auspicious, and those other than them
* Shina - Without
* Adhubandhi - Adhuvabandhi prakriti
* Mikchh Vinu - Besides Mithyatva
* Mohadhruvbandho - The remaining Dhruvabandhi prakritis of Mohaniya karma
* Nida - Sleep
* Upghaay - Upghāt
* Mosan - Mixed Mohaniya
* Samm - Samyaktva Mohaniya
* Pananavad - Forty-nine
* Madhuvridya - Adhruvodaya

**Meaning:**

* Stable, auspicious, and those other than them (unstable and inauspicious) - 66 Adhruvabandhi prakritis
* Besides Mithyatva, the Dhruvabandhi prakritis of Mohaniya karma - 18 prakritis
* Five sleep, Upghāt, mixed and Samyaktva Mohaniya - 65 prakritis

**Total:** These 65 prakritis are Adhruvodaya.

**Special Meaning:**

In the previous verse, 27 Dhruvodaya prakritis were mentioned. Therefore, out of the 122 prakritis that are capable of arising, these 27 prakritis are subtracted. 

Page #67:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

**Shataka**

After the karmas are shed, the remaining 65 **Prakritis** are **Adhruvodaya**. This is indicated in this verse. The general reason for considering these 65 **Prakritis** as **Adhruvodaya** is that many **Prakritis** are mutually contradictory. For example, **Tirthankara** and other **Prakritis** do not always arise in every being. Also, until the **Gunasthan** where the separation of **Prakritis** from **Gunapratyay** is not indicated, even if those **Prakritis** remain in that **Gunasthan**, the **Prakriti** may or may not arise in relation to **Dravy** etc. Therefore, they are considered **Anuvodaya** in **Prakritis**. A detailed explanation of this is given below.

Previously, the names of 73 **Adhruvabandhini Prakritis** were mentioned. Out of these, except for the four **Prakritis** of **Sthira**, **Asthira**, **Shubha**, and **Ashubha**, the remaining 66 **Prakritis** are **Adhruvodaya**. Out of these 73 **Prakritis**, the five **Prakritis** of **Tirthankara**, **Uchchvas**, **Udyot**, **Atap**, and **Paraghat** arise in some beings but not in others. The remaining 64 **Prakritis**, just as they are contradictory in the state of **Bandha**, are also contradictory in the state of **Udaya**. Therefore, they are called **Adhruvodaya**.

Out of the 19 **Dhruvabandhini Prakritis** of **Mohaniya Karma**, except for **Mithyatva**, the remaining 16 **Kshayas**, **Bhaya**, and **Jugupsa**, these 18 **Dhruvabandhini Prakritis** are **Adhruvodaya**. This is because they are mutually contradictory in **Udaya**. When **Krodha** arises, the other **Kshayas** like **Mana** etc. do not arise. Similarly, when **Mana** etc. arise, one should know about **Krodha** etc. Therefore, even though they are not contradictory in relation to **Bandha**, **Kshayas** like **Krodha** etc. are contradictory in relation to **Udaya**. Due to this contradictory nature, **Kshayas** are called **Adhruvodaya**. The **Udaya** of **Bhava** and **Jugupsa** is also **Kadachitka**. They arise in some beings at some time. 

Page #68:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma Granth

**There is no fixed time for the arising of any of these.** Therefore, both of these are considered to be **Adhruvodya**.

**The five types of Nidra, such as Nidra, are considered Adhruvodya because their arising happens sometimes and sometimes not, and they are mutually contradictory.** This means that only one Nidra arises at a time.

**The arising of the Upghāt Nāmakarma happens to a being sometimes.** Therefore, it is Adhruvodya.

**The Mixed Nature is considered Adhruvodya because its arising is opposed to Samyaktva and Mithyatva, which are Mohaniya.** During the time of these, its arising does not happen. The arising of Samyaktva Mohaniya happens to the Vedak (Kshayopaśamik) Samyagdṛṣṭi, and the time of the arising of Vedak Samyaktva is from the lowest Antamuhurta to the highest 66 Sagara plus four previous Kotis. Therefore, it is Adhruvodya.

**In this way, the Natures are Adhruvodya.** Even if there is a break in their arising, they can arise again.

**The reason for not considering Mithyatva Mohaniya as an Adhruvodya Nature is that the arising of Mithyatva continuously remains in the first Mithyatva Gunasthan, not stopping even for a moment.** Whereas, the arising of Adhruvodya Natures happens sometimes and sometimes not due to the cause of Dravya, Kshetra, Kala, etc., until their arising ceases. Therefore, they are called Adhruvodya.

**Explanation of the Mangas like Anavi-Ananta in the Bandha and Savaya Natures**

**Out of the 120 Bandhyoga Natures, 47 are Dhruvabandhini and 73 are Adhruvabandhini.** And **out of the 122 Udayayoga Natures, 27 are Dhruvodya and 55 are Adhruvodya.** In this way, the Bandha and Udaya Natures are of two types: Dhruva and Adhruva.

**Kuku**
**Shataka**

The question arises from the form that the **Dhruva** (permanent) **Prakritis** (principles) are always bound and arise from the beginningless (**Anadi**) to the endless (**Anant**) time, and the **Adhruva** (impermanent) **Prakritis** are bound and arise from the beginning (**Sadi**) to the end (**Sant**). Therefore, one should consider these two parts as **Anadi Anant** and **Sadi Sant**.

The solution is that the worldly being (**Sansari Jiva**) is the doer and the enjoyer of **Karmas** (actions). This process continues from the beginningless to the endless time. But, those beings who are **Bhavya** (worthy of liberation) and **Abhavya** (not worthy of liberation), there are four types of **Bhang** (break) in relation to them: **Anadi Anant**, **Anadi Sant**, **Sadi Anant**, and **Sadi Sant**. These are explained in the **Prakritis** of **Karma**.

The names of the four **Bhang** that occur in the **Karma Prakritis** have been mentioned earlier. Out of them, except for the third **Bhang** in the **Dhruva Bandhini Prakritis**, the remaining three **Bhang** are **Anadi Anant**, **Anadi Sant**, and **Sadi Sant**, which are as follows:

The first **Bhang**, **Anadi Anant**, occurs in relation to **Abhavya** beings. Because the **Dhruva Bandhini Prakritis** of **Abhavya** beings are bound from the beginningless to the endless time. The second **Bhang**, **Anadi Sant**, occurs in relation to **Bhavya** beings. Because when the binding of the fourteen **Prakritis** - five **Jnana Avarana** (knowledge obscurations), five **Antaraya** (hindrances), and four **Darshana Avarana** (perception obscurations) - is broken in the tenth **Gunasthan** (stage of spiritual progress), then the **Anadi Sant Bhang** occurs. And when a being dies after binding the aforementioned fourteen **Prakritis** in the eleventh **Gunasthan** (stage of spiritual progress) - **Upshant Moh** (stage of subdued delusion) - or when the time of the eleventh **Gunasthan** is completed, and the being falls from the eleventh **Gunasthan** and binds the aforementioned fourteen **Prakritis** again, and then breaks their binding in the tenth **Gunasthan**, then the fourth **Bhang**, **Sadi Sant**, occurs.

## The Pacyakarma Granth

**The cessation of the bondage of Sanchalan Kshaya occurs when a being attains the ninth Gunasthan. This is the first Anadi-Sant Bhang. When the same being falls from the ninth Gunasthan and again binds itself with Sanchalan Kshaya, and then again attains the ninth Gunasthan and ceases the bondage, this is the fourth Sadi-Sant Bhang.**

**The thirteen natures: Nidra, Prachala, Tejam, Karman, Varnachatusk, Agurulaghu, Upghāt, Nirman, Bhay and Jugupsa, are severed in the eighth Gunasthan. This is the first Anadi-Sant Bhang. When they are bound again after falling from the eighth Gunasthan, this is Sadi Bandh. When they are severed again upon attaining the eighth Gunasthan, this is Bandh Sant. Thus, the fourth Sadi-Sant Bhang occurs in them.**

**The bondage of the four Pratyakhyana Avaran Kshayas is Anadi until the fifth Gunasthan. However, it ceases in the sixth Gunasthan, making it Mant. Therefore, the first Anadi-Sant Bhang occurs. When the bondage begins again after falling from the sixth Gunasthan, and it ceases upon attaining the sixth Gunasthan, the fourth Sadi-Sant Bhang occurs.**

**The bondage of the four Apratyakhyana Avaran Kshayas is Anadi until the fourth Gunasthan. However, it ends in the fifth Gunasthan, making it the second Anadi-Sant Bhang. When the bondage begins again after falling from the fifth Gunasthan, and it ceases upon attaining the fifth Gunasthan, the fourth Sadi-Sant Bhang occurs.**

**The bondage of the four Kshayas: Mithyatva, Styanadvitrik, and Anantanubandhi, is Anadi. When the being attains Samyaktva, the bondage of these Kshayas ceases, making it the second Anadi-Sant Bhang. When the being falls back into Mithyatva...** 

Page #71:
---------------------------
The fourth type of *sadi-sant* destruction occurs when the *karmas* of the mentioned natures are bound and not bound again upon attaining *samyaktvam*. Thus, in the *dhruvabandhini* natures, except for the third type of *sadi-anant* destruction, there are three other types of destruction: *anadi-anant*, *anadi-sant*, and *sadi-sant*.

Now, we discuss the destruction in the *dhruvodaya* natures. In the *dhruvodaya* natures, there are two types of destruction: the first is *anadi-anant* and the second is *anadi-sant*. The names of the 27 *dhruvodaya* natures have been mentioned in their respective places. Among them, the *mithyatva* nature is special. Therefore, its *karmas* are discussed separately, and we now explain the remaining 26 natures.

The first type of *anadi-anant* destruction in the 26 *dhruvodaya* natures, namely *nirman*, *sthira*, *asthira*, *agurulaghu*, *shubha*, *ashubha*, *tejas*, *karman*, *varna-chaturshka*, five *jnana-avaranas*, five *antarayas*, and four *darshan-avaranas*, occurs in relation to *abhavya* beings. Because the *dhruvodaya* natures of *abhavya* beings have neither beginning nor end.

The second type of *anadi-sant* destruction occurs in relation to *bhavya* beings. The five *jnana-avaranas*, five *antarayas*, and four *darshan-avaranas*, these fourteen natures, have been present in beings since *anadi* time until the twelfth *gunasthan*. But when their destruction occurs at the end of the twelfth *gunasthan*, that destruction is called *anadi-sant*. Similarly, the remaining twelve natures, such as *nirman*, *sthira*, *asthira*, etc., have an *anadi* origin, and when their destruction occurs at the end of the thirteenth *sayogikevali* *gunasthan*, their destruction is called *anadi-sant*.

Thus, except for *mithyatva*, only two types of destruction occur in the remaining *dhruvodaya* natures: *anadi-anant* in relation to *abhavya* beings.

## The Fifth Firm Granth

And for the Bhavyas, the Aanadi-Saant. The remaining two, Bhang-Sadi-Anann and Sadi-Saant, do not occur. Because, if the arising of any nature, after its cessation, arises again, then that arising is called Sadi. But the arising and cessation of the aforementioned Dhruvodaya natures, after the end of the twelfth and thirteenth Gunasthanas, do not occur again. And after attaining those Gunasthanas, the Jiva does not return to the lower Gunasthanas, but attains liberation. Therefore, the Sadi arising of the aforementioned natures does not occur. Hence, the remaining two Bhangs also do not occur.

In the twenty-six Dhruvodaya natures, there are two Bhangs at the beginning, but in Mithyatva, there are three Bhangs: Aanadi-Anant, Aanadi-Saant, and Sadi-Saant. The Aanadi-Anant Bhang occurs in relation to the Abhavyas, the Aanadi-Saant Bhang occurs in relation to the Aanadi Mithyaishti Bhavyas. The Aanadi-Anant Bhang is considered in relation to the Abhavyas because the absence of the arising of their Mithyatva has never been and will never be. The Aanadi-Saant Bhang is considered in relation to the Bhavyas because, upon attaining Samyaktva for the first time, the absence of their Aanadikalin Mithyatva occurs. The fourth, Sadi-Saant Bhang, also occurs in relation to the Bhavyas who, after losing Samyaktva and attaining Mithyatva again, attain Samyaktva again and make its absence. Thus, three Bhangs occur in the Dhruvodaya Mithyatva nature.

In the Adhruvbandhini and Adhruvodaya natures, only the Sadi-Saant Bhang occurs. Because their bondage and arising are Adhruv, sometimes they occur and sometimes they do not. Thus, one should understand the order of Bhangs in the bondage and arising natures. 

Page #73:
---------------------------
## Shataka

This is a summary of the 35 types of Bandha and Upak (sub-species) and how they manifest in the Meghas.  

Except for Mithyatva, the remaining Uday (arising) natures have two types of Bhang (destruction): Anadi-Anant (beginningless-infinite) and Anadi-Sant (beginningless-finite). Mithyatva has three types of Bhang: Anadi-Anant, Anadi-Sant, and Maadi-Sant (beginning-finite). 

Dhruva-Bandhini (fixed-binding) natures have three types of Bhang: Anadi-Anant, Anadi-Sant, and Saadi-Sant (beginning-finite). Adhruva-Bandha (unfixed-binding) and Uday natures have only one type of Bhang: Saadi-Sant. 

These Bhangs arise due to the Pariṇāmik (consequential) state of the Bhavy (blessed) and Abhavy (unblessed) souls. The author has already indicated the Bhangs that occur in the natures in the form of a Sutra (aphorism) in verse 5:

**Padmabia Dhūvajavasu Dhavajandisū Taiyavaj Bhangalingam | Micchammī Tigni Bhangā Dahavi Adhuvā Turis Bhangā ||**

This means: Padmabia (lotus-like), Dhūvajavasu (flag-like), Dhavajandisū (flag-like), Taiyavaj (sun-like) have one Bhang. Mithyatva has three Bhangs. Adhuvā (unfixed) has four Bhangs.

After explaining the Dhruva-Adhruva Bandha, Uday natures, their names, and the number of Bhangs that occur in them along with their causes, the author now lists the Dhruva and Adhruva Satya (truth) natures in two verses:

**Tamabannavīs Sagateya-Kamma Ghūyabandhi Ses Vetigam | Āmitim Veṇiyam Bujuyal Sagaural Sāsachaū || 8 ||**

**Khagaitirim Nīyam Dhūvasantā Sammā Mos Manuyadugam | Vivikkār Aṇāū Hārasaguccha Adhuvasantā || 9 ||**

**Meaning:**

* **Verse 8:** Twenty-three (Tamabannavīs) natures, including Sagateya-Kamma (action-based), Ghūyabandhi (binding), Ses (remaining), Vetigam (three Vedas), Āgitirigam (three forms), and six others.
* **Verse 9:** Khagaitirim (sky-like), Nīyam (ethical), Dhūvasantā (fixed-truth), Sammā (right), Mos (liberation), Manuyadugam (human-like), Vivikkār (differentiation), Aṇāū (non-existent), Hārasaguccha (chain of bondage), Adhuvasantā (unfixed-truth).

**Special Meaning:** After classifying the bondage and liberation-worthy natures by the difference between Dhruva and Adhruva, these two verses state the number of Dhruva Sattaa and Adhruva Sattaa natures. Some natures are named, while others are indicated by their designations.

**Bondage-worthy natures are 120 and liberation-worthy are 122, but the number of Sattaa natures is 158.** The reason for the difference between the number of bondage, liberation, and Sattaa natures is explained in the appendix.

These terms describe the number of different types of **Dhruva** and **Adhruva** entities, along with the names of some of these entities. From **Tasvalavis** to **Niyam Dhruva-Santa Pad**, the names of **Dhruva** entities are listed. From **Sammimi-Manuyadugam** to **Harasguchcha Pad**, the names of **Adhruva** entities are listed.

In **Bandha** and **Uday**, the number of **Dhruva-Bandhini** and **Dhruva-Uday** entities is less than **Anubandhini** and **Anuvodaya** entities. However, in **Satta**, the number of **Dhruva-Satta** entities is more than **Adhruva-Satta** entities. This is because it is not necessary for an entity to arise at the time of **Bandha** or for an entity to be bound at the time of its **Uday**.

## Translation:

**Shataka**

It is true that the number of beings in the state of bondage (bandha) and undergoing emergence (udaya) is vast. However, the beings in this state undoubtedly possess a permanent existence (dhruva satta). This is why the number of beings with fluctuating existence (adhruva satta) is less than those with permanent existence.

The text explains the reason for considering the twenty-two (vasadi) to the twenty-eight (meech gotra) natures as possessing permanent existence.

The twenty-two (vasadi), twenty-four (varnadi), and seven (tanjas-karman) natures all possess permanent existence in all worldly beings. All the permanently bound (dhruva bandhini) natures possess permanent existence. Because those who are constantly bound must possess permanent existence. However, in the twenty-four (varnavishak), the four (varna chatushk) and the seven (taijas-karman) natures, the taijas and karman bodies are separately mentioned. Therefore, six natures are excluded from the forty-seven permanently bound natures, leaving forty-one natures.

The three Vedas (tri vedas) are described as having fluctuating bondage and emergence, but their existence is permanent. Because the bondage of the Vedas occurs gradually, but there is no conflict in their simultaneous presence.

The Vedaniya Dwik is considered to have permanent existence, unlike the mutual transition of the two parties.

The pairs of Hasyarati and Shokarati have permanent existence until the ninth Gunasthan. Therefore, their existence is considered permanent.

The seven (oudarik saptak) also have permanent existence. Because humans and animals experience their emergence, while gods and hell beings experience their bondage. Therefore, they are considered to have permanent existence.

Similarly, the four (uchchvas chatushk), the pair of Vihayogati, the two (tiryanch dwik), and the twenty-eight (neech gotra) also have permanent existence. These natures are present in all beings before attaining perfect knowledge (samyaktva). Therefore, they are called permanent existence. 

Page #78:
---------------------------
## Fifth Karma Granth

After explaining the reason for considering the Dhruvasatta (permanent existence) of the Dhruvasatta Prakṛtis, we now explain the reason for considering the remaining Prakṛtis as Adhruvasatta (non-permanent existence).

The existence of Samyaktva (right faith) and Misra Mohaniya (mixed delusion) is not present in Abhavya (non-liberated beings), and even among Bhavyas (liberated beings), it is not present in many. When the Tejaskaaya (fire-bodied) and Vayukaaya (air-bodied) beings experience the Udvalana (transformation) of Manushyadvik (human-like body), the existence of Manushyadvik is not present. Therefore, Manushyadvik is considered Adhruvasatta.

The existence of the Vaikriya Ekadasha (eleventh Prakṛti) is not present in the Anadi Nigodhya (eternal) beings, and it is not present in those who have not attained the Trasa Paryaya (third stage of liberation). Due to the absence of bondage in those who have not attained the Trasa Paryaya, or due to the destruction of their state upon entering the Sthavara (stationary) realm, or due to the absence of existence of the being who experiences Udvalana in the Ekendriya (one-sense) realm, the Vaikriya Ekadasha is considered Adhruvasatta.

Even with the presence of Samyaktva, the Tirthakara Karma (karma of a Tirthankara) is present in some and not in others. And due to the complete absence of bondage in the case of the Devayau (divine body) and Narakayu (hellish body) of the Sthavaras, the Tirthachayau (karma of a Tirthankara) of the Ahmindras (nine Veiyaka and five Anuttara Devas), the Manushyayau (human body) of the Tejaskaaya, Vayukaaya, and the Narakas (hell beings) of the seventh hell, their existence is not present. Therefore, these Prakṛtis are considered Adhruvasatta.

The existence of the Aharakasaptak (seven Aharaka Prakṛtis) is present in some and not in others, even with the presence of Samyama (self-control). It is not a rule that all Samyamadharis (those who practice self-control) must have an Aharaka body. The Ucchha Gotra (high lineage) is also not present in the Anadi Nigodhya beings, and it is not present in the Tejaskaaya and Vayukaaya beings after experiencing Udvalana. Therefore, the twenty-eight Prakṛtis are Adhruvasatta.

## Translation:

**Chapter**

Having stated how many and which of the 158 types of Satta-Prakritis are Dhruva-Satta and Adhruva-Satta, we now describe the Dhruva-Satta and Adhruva-Satta of some Prakṛtis in relation to their Gunasthanas in the next three verses.

**Verses:**

10. In the first three Gunasthanas, Mithyatva, Niyama, Ajaya, etc. are definitely present in the eight Gunasthanas through Bhajana (choice). In the Sasadan Gunasthan, Samyak-tva is definitely present in the Mithyatva, etc. ten Gunasthanas through choice.

11. In the Sasadan and Misra Gunasthanas, Dhruva-Satta is present. In the Mithyatva, etc. nine Gunasthanas, Mitra-Mohaniya is present through choice. In the first two Gunasthanas, Anan-Anubandhi is definitely present through choice in the Misra, etc. nine Gunasthanas.

12. The Aharak Matak is not present in all Gunasthanas, in the second and third Gunasthanas, or in the Tirthankara Namkarma, without choice. 

Page #80:
---------------------------
## Fifth (Pancham)

The existence of both, Mithyatva-Mithyatvi, is certain until the end of the moment (Antamuhurt) even when the Tirthankara Karma is present.

**Verse:**

In the first three Gunasthanas, the existence of Mithyatva Mohaniya is certain, and in the eight Gunasthanas starting from Aviriti, it is optional. In the Sasadan Gunasthan, the existence of Samyaktava Mohaniya is certain, and in the ten Gunasthanas starting from Mithyatva, it is optional.

In the Sasadan and Misra Gunasthanas, the existence of Misra Prakriti is certain, and in the nine Gunasthanas starting from Mithyatva, it is optional. In the first two Gunasthanas, the existence of Anantanubandhi Kashaya is certain, and in the nine Gunasthanas starting from Misra, it is optional.

The Aharak Saptak is optional in all Gunasthanas. Except for the second and third Gunasthanas, the Tirthankara Karma is optional in the remaining Gunasthanas. The Mithyadristi Gunasthan does not have the existence of both (Aharak Saptak and Tirthankara Karma). If a being with the existence of Tirthankara Karma falls into Mithyatva, it is only for the duration of Antamuhurt.

**Special Meaning:**

These three verses explain the existence of certain Prakritis in the Gunasthanas, specifying which Prakriti is certain and optional in which Gunasthan. The rule regarding the existence of Mithyatva and Samyaktava Prakriti is explained. The verse states that "Pathmati Gunesu Miccham Niyama" - Mithyatva Mohaniya is certain in the first three Gunasthanas. 

Page #81:
---------------------------
Nature certainly has an existence. It is also said that 'Sasaane Khalu Sammam Santan' - Samyaktva is a mohaniya (delusive) kriti (action) in the Sasadan gunasthan (state of being). The definite existence of both Mithyatva Mohaniya and Samyaktva Mohaniya has been stated. Thus, while stating the definite existence of Mithyatva Mohaniya and Samyaktva Mohaniya in the gunasthanas, the alternative existence of these two natures in the gunasthanas has been indicated by the terms 'Ajayaiaṭṭhage Bhajj' and 'Micchaaidasage Ya' respectively. This means that the nature of Mithyatva exists in the fourth Aviriti Samyagdristi and the other eight gunasthanas, while the nature of Samyaktva exists in the first ten gunasthanas, including Mithyatva, except for Sasadan. The reason for this is explained below.

The existence of Mithyatva nature in the first, second, and third gunasthanas is considered because Mithyatva exists in the Mithyatva gunasthan. During the time of Upshama Samyaktva, some beings attain the Sasadan gunasthan when at least one and at most six Avaliya periods remain. At that time, these beings certainly have the existence of both Mithyatva and Samyaktva nature. Therefore, along with stating the existence of Mithyatva in the second gunasthan, the existence of Samyaktva has also been stated.

"Uvasamasammattaao Chayao Miccham Apavamaanass. Saasayanasammattam Tayantarallammi Chaavaliy." - Visheo Bhaay 534. During the time of Upshama Samyaktva, when at most 6 Avaliya periods remain, the being, due to the arising of Anantanubandhi Kshaya, becomes detached from Upshama Samyaktva and until the being does not come into Mithyatva, it becomes Sasadan Samyagdristi for that period of time. 

Page #82:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma Granth

When an anadi mithyatva jiva, for the first time, is on the path to attaining samyaktva, due to the power of karana labdhi, at the time of prathamopasham samyaktva, the three forms of mithyatva mohaniya dalakas become: pure, semi-pure, and impure. Pure dalik is called samyaktva, semi-pure is called mishra, and impure is called mithyatva mohaniya.

At the end of upasham samyaktva, if mithyatva mohaniya arises from the three mentioned bundles, then it becomes the first gunasthan. If mishra (samyaktva-mithyatva) mohaniya arises, then it becomes the third mishra gunasthan. Thus, in the first and third gunasthan, the existence of mithyatva remains. Therefore, the existence of mithyatva is considered in the first, second, and third gunasthan.

Except for the fourth aviriti and the following eight gunasthan, the reason for the existence or non-existence of mithyatva in these gunasthan is that if mithyatva is destroyed in these gunasthan, meaning kshayik samyaktva is attained, then the existence of mithyatva does not remain. And if mithyatva is suppressed, then the existence of mithyatva definitely remains. Due to the existence of mithyatva, the upasham श्रेणी वाला ( श्रेणी वाला meaning "belonging to the श्रेणी") falls from the eleventh gunasthan.

Except for the second sasadan gunasthan, the reason for the existence or non-existence of samyaktva prakriti in the remaining ten gunasthan, including mithyatva, is due to vikalpa (alternative). This means that it both exists and does not exist. In the mithyatva gunasthan, the anadi mithyatva jiva who has never experienced the pure, semi-pure, and impure bundles of mithyatva, and the anadi mithyatva jiva who has abandoned samyaktva (pure bundle), does not have the existence of samyaktva prakriti. The remaining mithyatva jivas have its existence. Similarly, in the mithyatva gunasthan, the jiva who has abandoned samyaktva... 

Page #83:
---------------------------
##  Shataka 46

In the mixed (Mishra) Gunasthan, the being's Samyaktva (right faith) does not exist, but it does exist for other beings. From the fourth to the eleventh Gunasthan, the Samyaktva of the Kshayik Samyamhasti (one who has attained the highest state of liberation) is not susceptible to delusion (Moha), but it does exist for the Kshayopashmik and Aupashmik Samyagdristi (those who have attained the state of right faith). Thus, the nature of the Mohianiya Karma (karma that causes delusion) and the existence of Mithyatva (false faith) and Samyaktva are considered in the first eleven Gunasthanas. In the last three Gunasthanas, the Mohianiya Karma is destroyed, so it does not exist. Now, let's consider the existence of Mithya Mohianiya and Ananta Anubandhi Kashaya (infinitely binding passions).

**The Rule of Existence of Mixed Mohianiya and Ananta Anubandhi**

To determine the specific Gunasthan where the Mixed Mohianiya exists, it is stated: "Sasanamose su Dhuruv Misan" - In the Sasanadan and Mishra Gunasthan, the Mithya (Samyamihyatva) Mohianiya exists by rule. The reason is that when the being attains the first stage of liberation (Prathamopashma Samyaktva), three bundles of Mithyatva are formed. When at least one and at most six Avaliya Kalas (periods of time) remain during that Samyaktva, the Sasanadan Gunasthan is attained. At that time, the being's results are neither completely Samyaktva nor Mithyatva, but contain both Samyaktva and Mithyatva aspects. Therefore, the Mixed nature exists. This is why the existence of the Mixed nature is established in the second Gunasthan.

The third Mishra Gunasthan cannot occur without the arising of Mixed Mohianiya. Therefore, the existence of the Mixed nature is certain in the third Gunasthan.

---------------------------
The fifth karmagranthi is about the gunasthanas obtained through choice. It is said that 'michchainavasu bhayanae', meaning the first gunasthana except the second and third. The fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth gunasthanas have an adhruvasatta. Because the mithyadristi jiva who has experienced the udvalana of the mixed nature, does not have the satta of the mixed nature of his anadi mithyatva. In the fourth to eighth gunasthanas, the kshayik samyagdristi does not have the satta of the mixed nature, while the rest of the jivas do.

After stating the satta of the mixed mohaniya nature, we now explain the satta of the anantanubandhi.

It is said about the definite gunasthanas of the anantanubandhi - 'Aidugae an niyama' etc., that the anantanubandhi has a dhruvasatta in the first two gunasthanas. Because the anantanubandhi is bound until the second gunasthana, its satta will definitely remain. In the remaining third to ninth gunasthanas, its satta is adhruva - 'Bhaiya misainavgammi'. Because the anantanubandhi does not have satta for the one who disconnects the anantanubandhi kshaya.

Regarding the adhruvasatta of the anantanubandhi, the above kamgranthik mat has been mentioned that it has satta through choice in the third to ninth gunasthanas. But karmaprakriti and panch
1 Sanjoyan | U nimma dhusu panchasu hoi bhayadhwan.
- Karmaprakriti (satsadhikār) is in two gunasthanas by the anantanubandhi niyama and is bhajanīya in five gunasthanas.

---------------------------
## Translation:

**Shataka.**

In the five Gunasthanas from the third to the seventh, the existence of Satta is considered in the Sangraha.

The reason for the difference in considering the existence of Anantanubandhi Kshaya up to the eleventh Gunasthana in the Karmagrantha and up to the seventh Gunasthana in the Karmaprakriti and Panchasangraha is that the Karmaprakriti and Panchasangrahakar do not accept the existence of Anandanubandhi in the Upshamashroni, while the Gamgar accepts its existence. The essence of the Karmaprakritikar's view is that one who strives to subdue the Charitra Mohaniya inevitably disconnects from the Anantanubandhi. The rule of existence for the Aharak Saptak and Tirthankar Prakriti

The Aharak Saptak has been said to exist in all Gunasthanas. This means that the Aharak Saptak exists in all Gunasthanas by choice. There is no Gunasthana where it can be said that the Aharak Saptak exists by rule, meaning that its existence is not fixed in all Gunasthanas.

The reason for this is that the Aharak Sharira is a Namkarma Prashasta Prakriti, and its bondage occurs to some pure Charitradharak, Apramat Sanayami. When an Apramat Sanayami is bound by the Aharak Sharira,

1.  "Sasyanant Niyama Pancha Su Bhajja Abhi Padham." - Panchasangraha 342
    Go. Karmakanda Gatha 391 mentions a difference of opinion with the phrase "Tthi Anan Upsamge" and gives space to both opinions.
2.  (a) "Shubham Vishuddham Avyaghati Chaharak Chaturdasha Bandh Rasya." - Tattvarth Sutra 2.46
    (b) The Panchasangraha hints at the reason for the bondage of the Aharak Sharira and Tirthankar Prakriti.
    "Tisthey Raharanam Bandhe Sammat Sanjama Heu." Sangraha 204. Samyaktva is the reason for the bondage of the Tirthankar Prakriti, and Sanjam is the reason for the bondage of the Aharak. 

Page #86:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma Granth

When a being, due to pure karmic results, ascends to higher **Gunasthanas** (spiritual states), the **Ayantra** (the karmic influence of the five senses) remains. However, when the being descends to lower **Gunasthanas** due to impure karmic results, the **Aharak Saptak** (the sevenfold karmic influence of food) remains. 

But a **Samyami Muni** (a perfected soul) who is free from distractions and does not bind the **Aharak Saptak** while ascending or descending **Gunasthanas**, does not possess the **Aharak Saptak** in those **Gunasthanas**. Due to this difference, the **Aharak Saptak** is considered to be present in all **Gunasthanas** in a potential form.

Similar to the **Aharak Saptak**, the **Tirthankara Namkarma** (the karmic influence of becoming a Tirthankara) is also of a **Prashasta** (refined) nature. It occurs in accordance with time and is present in some **Vishuddha Samyagdristi** (perfectly enlightened beings) from the fourth **Gunastana** to the sixth part of the eighth **Gunastana**. However, regarding its presence in the **Gunasthanas**, the **Gatha** (scripture) indicates that "**Vitigune Vina Tittham**" - it is present in all **Gunasthanas** except the second and third, in a potential form.

The reason for this is that when a being, from the fourth to the sixth part of the eighth **Gunastana**, binds the **Tirthankara** nature, and then ascends to higher **Gunasthanas** due to pure karmic results, the **Tirthankara** nature is present in those **Gunasthanas**. However, if the same being, having bound the **Tirthankara** nature, descends to lower **Gunasthanas** due to impure karmic results, it will also reach the **Mithyatva Gunastana** (the state of false belief), but not the second or third **Gunastana**. Therefore, the **Tirthankara Namkarma** can be present in all twelve **Gunasthanas** except the second and third. 

However, even if a being attains **Vishuddha Samyaktva** (perfect enlightenment), it does not bind the **Tirthankara** nature... 

Page #87:
---------------------------
**Panak**

If someone possesses the Panak, then the essence of the Tirthankara nature is not found in all of their Gunasthanas.

The implication of this statement is that the Tirthankara nature is not found in the second and third Gunasthanas, and in the remaining Gunasthanas, it is possible for those who have bound it, but for those who have not bound it, it does not exist. Therefore, the essence of the Tirthankara nature is considered to be impermanent.

The reason why a bound Tirthankara nature can enter the Mithyatva Mrunastana is that if a being has previously bound itself to Naraka, and then attained Kshayopaashamak Samyaktv, and as a result of the fruits of the Sayas, has bound the Tirthankara nature, then at the end of its life, it vomits Samyaktv and attains the Mithyatva Gunastana, taking birth in Naraka. This is why it is said that a bound Tirthankara nature can attain the Mithyatva Gunastana.

Even if a being with the Tirthankara nature attains the Mithyatva Gunastana, it only stays there for a short time - Antamuhurta. The reason for this is that if a being has previously bound itself to Naraka, and later becomes a Vedak Samyagdristi and binds the Tirthankara nature, then when death approaches, the being becomes devoid of Samyaktv and becomes a Mithyadristi, and in the Mithyatva state, it takes birth in Naraka and becomes a Samyagdristi after Antamuhurta. This statement is based on the expectation of the Nikachit Tirthankara Karma. Because a being with the essence of the Nikachit Tirthankara Karma does not stay in the Mithyatva Gunastana for more than Antamuhurta, and after becoming sufficient, it immediately attains Samyaktv.

---------------------------
##  The Fivefold Karma-Generated

Thus, only the sevenfold Āhāraka or only the Tīrthankara nature can attain the first Mithyātva Guṇasthāna. The Lokas, which are the fortresses of the internal observance of the sevenfold Āhāraka, clearly state that "the being who is both, does not have Mithyātva." That is, the being who has both Āhāraka and Tīrthankara nature, does not fall, and therefore does not enter the Mithyātva Guṇasthāna. _Thus, with the description of the Dhruvasattāka and Adhruvasattāka natures, the consideration of the existence of these fifteen natures - Mithyātva, Miśra, Samyaktva, Mohaniya, Anantānubandhī Chatuṣka, and Tīrthankara and Āhāraka Saptaka - in the Guṇasthānas has been done. Of these, the first is unrefined, and the remaining eight are refined, and are the main ones._

The statement of the existence of these fifteen natures, starting with Mithyātva, in the Guṇasthānas, has been made for a specific reason. Because, the seven natures - Mithyātva, Miśra, Samyaktva, Mohaniya, Anantānubandhī Chatuṣka - have a close relationship with the rise and fall of the being. As long as these natures exist, the being cannot attain Samyaktva, the goal of liberation. Due to their presence, the being does not understand the true goal, and continues to wander in the world. But when these natures become inactive, devoid of existence, then the being breaks free from the bonds of the world and becomes established in its true nature for eternity. _Just as the seven natures, starting with Mithyātva, are the main ones among the unrefined natures, similarly, the Āhāraka Saptaka and the Tīrthankara Nāmakarma are the main ones among the refined natures. Because, the bondage of the Āhāraka Saptaka happens rarely to ascetics, and the Tīrthankara nature is even more rare than that._

## Shataka

**Chapter**

**Krisa** - Someone is bound. Therefore, the qualities of the primary natures in the unrefined and refined natures have been discussed. Now, we will discuss the number of destructive and non-destructive natures.

**Destructive and Non-Destructive Natures**

**13.**  **Kevaljjuyal** (pure knowledge), **Avarana** (coverings), **Pan** (five), **Niha** (sleep), **Baras** (twelve), **Aimkasyaya** (root passions), **Micch** (falsehood), **Ti** (thus), **Samvaghai** (all-destructive), **Chauna** (four), **Pan** (knowledge), **Tivasan** (three), **Avarana** (coverings).

**14.** **Sanjalan** (agitation), **Nokasaya** (nine passions), **Vigyam** (five obstacles), **Iy... Ya** (and), **Desghaatn** (country-destructive), **Y** (and), **Aghai** (non-destructive), **Patt** (each), **Yasanucha** (eight), **Sasayosa** (eight), **Go** (two), **Yadug** (two), **Banna** (four).

**Word Meanings**

* **Kevaljjuyal** - Pure knowledge, pure vision
* **Avarana** - Coverings
* **Pan** - Five
* **Niha** - Sleep
* **Baras** - Twelve
* **Aimkasyaya** - Root passions
* **Micch** - Falsehood
* **Ti** - Thus
* **Samvaghai** - All-destructive
* **Chauna** - Four
* **Pan** (knowledge) - Knowledge
* **Tivasan** - Three
* **Avarana** - Coverings
* **Sanjalan** - Agitation
* **Nokasaya** - Nine passions
* **Vigyam** - Five obstacles
* **Iy... Ya** - And
* **Desghaatn** - Country-destructive
* **Y** - And
* **Aghai** - Non-destructive
* **Patt** - Each
* **Yasanucha** - Eight
* **Sasayosa** - Eight
* **Go** - Two
* **Yadug** - Two
* **Banna** - Four

**Meaning**

The **Kevaljjuyal** (pure knowledge) coverings, five sleeps, twelve root passions, and falsehood are all-destructive natures. Four knowledge coverings, three vision coverings, agitation passions, nine passions, and five obstacles are country-destructive natures. Each of the eight primary and eight non-primary natures are to be known.

---------------------------
## Fifth Karma Group

The eight categories of nature, namely body (sharira), etc., four lifespans (ayu), the two types of lust (lasavishaka), the two types of karmic bondage (govaddhika), the two types of pain (vedaniyadvika), and the four types of color (varnachatushk), are non-destructive (aghatini) in nature.

**Special Note:** These two verses classify the karmic natures as destructive (ghati) and non-destructive (aghati) based on their number and types. They also specify the number and types of non-destructive natures.

Although, generally, all karmas are the cause of worldly existence, and as long as even a trace of karma remains, the soul is not considered to be in its true nature. There is always some deficiency in the completeness of self-development. However, some karmas hinder the manifestation of the soul's qualities, while others do not hinder manifestation but keep the soul bound to the world. From this perspective, karmas are classified into two types: destructive (ghati) and non-destructive (aghati).

Among the eight fundamental karmas, namely knowledge obscuration (jnanaavaran), perception obscuration (darshanavaran), delusion (mohaniya), and hindrance (antaraya), the first four are destructive, while pain (vedaniya), lifespan (ayu), name (nama), and lineage (gotra) are non-destructive.

The subsequent natures of the destructive karmas are also destructive, while the subsequent natures of the non-destructive karmas are non-destructive.

Those natures that destroy the soul's inherent qualities are called destructive, and those that are unable to destroy them are called non-destructive.

There are two types of destructive natures: all-destructive (sarvaghatini) and partially destructive (deshaghatini). The all-destructive natures completely destroy the soul's qualities, meaning that the soul's inherent qualities cannot manifest in their true form as long as these natures remain.

The partially destructive natures, although destructive to the soul's qualities, allow for a limited manifestation of these qualities even in their presence. 

Page #91:
---------------------------
It continues to be so. In the verses, while mentioning the names of the natures as water and non-fatal, two sub-species of fatal karma natures, namely, "deshghati" (treacherous) and "sarvaghati" (all-destructive), have been specifically mentioned. This clarifies two things: how many and which are all the fatal karma natures, and which of them are "sarvaghatini" (all-destructive) and which are "deshghatini" (treacherous). Their names are as follows: "Kevaljuyalavarna Pan Nida Barasaimkasaaya Miccham Ti Savvaghai." This verse indicates the names and number of "sarvaghatini" natures:

(1) Gnanavarna - Kevalgyanavarna.
(2) Darshanavarna - Kevaldarshanavarna, five nidras - nidra, nidranidra, prachala, prachala-prachala, styanaddhi.
(3) Mohaniya - Anantanubandhi krodh, man, maya, lobha, apratyakhyanadharan krodh, man, maya lobha, pratyakhyanavarna krodh, man, maya, lobha and mithyatva.

In total, these are 20. Among these, 1 Gnanavarna, 6 Darshanavarna, and 13 Mohaniya natures are included, which are called "sarvaghatini" because they destroy the fundamental qualities of the soul in all beings. The explanation is as follows: Kevalgyanavarna covers the soul's Kevalgyan granth (the source of omniscience). Until Kevalgyanavarna is removed, Kevalgyan (omniscience) does not arise. Therefore, Kevalgyanavarna is called "sarvaghati" (all-destructive). However, it should be kept in mind that:

1. Kevaliya Nan San Avaran Barmaimkasaaya.
Michhanam Nihao Iya Bim Samdhaio.
Panchasangrah 3.17 

Page #92:
---------------------------
Just as even when the sun is completely covered by a cloud, a portion of its light remains uncovered, allowing for the distinction between day and night, so too does an infinite portion of the knowledge of all beings remain uncovered. For if the veil of knowledge were to cover even that infinite portion, there would be no difference between the living and the non-living. This implies that as long as the veil of knowledge remains, perfect knowledge cannot arise, but even then, an infinite portion of its essence remains uncovered. This is something that even the veil of knowledge cannot cover. Because it covers all aspects of perfect knowledge except for an infinite portion of it, the veil of knowledge is called the "all-destroying" veil.

The veil of perfect perception completely covers perfect perception. Yet, an infinite portion of it remains uncovered. Perfect knowledge and perfect perception are co-existent, therefore, the reason for the infinite portion of the soul's perception remaining uncovered should be understood in the same way as the veil of knowledge.

The five types of sleep also prevent the living being from having a general perception of things. They obstruct the understanding of the senses. Therefore, they are considered to be "all-destroying" in nature. Out of the twelve passions, the infinite-binding passions destroy the very foundation of right knowledge, which is right conduct, and without right conduct, it is impossible for a living being to attain liberation. The passions of non-rejection and rejection destroy the virtue of character, which is essential for the living being to attain its true nature. The passion of non-rejection destroys the character of conduct in the world, and the passion of rejection destroys the character of complete renunciation. The existence of false belief... 

Page #93:
---------------------------
It is impossible for Samyaktva to arise in a Shataka (a period of 100 years), because it destroys all other qualities. Therefore, it is considered a "Sarvaghati" (destroyer of all). 

After discussing the "Sarvadhatini" (all-destroying) natures, we now mention the "Deshghatini" (country-destroying) natures: "Chatnana, Tirdasana, Abarana, Manjalan, Noksaya, Vigdha, these are Deshghatini." - These are the four Jnana Avaranas (knowledge obscurations), three Darsana Avaranas (perception obscurations), Sanjaldana (entanglement) Kashaya (passions) Chatushk (fourfold), No-No Kashaya (negative passions), and five Antaraya Karmas (hindering karmas). Their names are as follows:

(1) Jnana Avarana - Mati, Shruta, Avadhi, Manaparyaya Jnana Avarana.
(2) Darsana Avarana - Chakshu, Acha, Avadhi Darsana Avarana.
(3) Mohaniya - Sanchalana, Krodha, Mana, Maya, Lobha, Hasya, Rati, Arati, Shoka, Bhaya, Jugupsa, Stri-Purusha, Napumsaka, Veda.
(4) Antaraya - Dana, Labha, Bhoga, Upbhoga, Virya Antaraya.

There are 4 Jnana Avarana, 3 Darsana Avarana, 13 Mohaniya, and 5 Antaraya Karmas, totaling 25. These natures are called "Deshghatini" because they partially destroy the qualities of the soul. 

We clarify the reason for considering them "Deshghati" as follows: The four Jnana Avaranas, starting with Mati Jnana Avarana, only obscure those aspects of knowledge that are not already obscured by them. If someone, due to ignorance, does not understand the meaning of the fourfold knowledge (Mati, Shruta, Avadhi, Manaparyaya), then they should understand that this is the emergence of the obscuration of Mati Jnana Avarana, etc. However, the fourfold knowledge (Mati, Shruta, Avadhi, Manaparyaya) does not obscure the object of Keval Jnana (omniscience).

---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma-Pratikraman

**Subject:** Understanding the infinite number of **gunas** (qualities) is the **kevaldarshanavaran** (veil of omniscience). The **chakshudarshanavaran** (veil of visual perception), **achakshudarshanavaran** (veil of non-visual perception), and **avdhidarshanavaran** (veil of clairvoyance) are all just partial unveilings of the **kevaldarshan** (omniscience). When these veils arise, the individual cannot fully perceive the **vishayabhoot** (objects of perception) of **chakshudarshan** etc., but they are unable to perceive the infinite **avishayabhoot** (non-objects of perception) **gunas** due to the presence of the **kevaldarshanavaran**.

**Sanjwalan** (burning) **kashaya** (passion) and the four **chatupka** (types of karma) and the **hasya** (laughter) etc. **kashayas** are not capable of completely destroying the **charitra guna** (virtue), but they do cause **atichaar** (transgression) in the **mool guna** (root qualities) and **uttar guna** (secondary qualities). Therefore, they are considered **deshadhatini** (destructive to the body). While the other **kashayas** give rise to **anachar** (immorality).

**Antaray** (obstruction) karma's **danantaray** (obstruction to giving) etc. five **prakriti** (types) are considered **deshadhatini** because the **pudgal** (matter) that is suitable for **dan** (giving), **labh** (gain), **bhog** (enjoyment), and **upbhog** (consumption) are only an infinitesimal part of the infinite **pudgal dravya** (matter). This means that not all **pudgal dravya** is suitable for giving, taking, or enjoying. Only a very small amount of **pudgal** is suitable for these actions. It is also important to understand that even among the **bhogya pudgal** (enjoyable matter), a single **jiva** (soul) cannot give, gain, enjoy, or consume all **pudgal**. Each **jiva** receives only the **pudgal** that is suitable for them. Therefore, **danantaray**, **labhantaray**, **bhogantaray**, and **upbhogantaray** are **deshadhatini**. **Veeryantaray** (obstruction to energy) is also **deshadhatini**.

**Sanveya** (to be understood) **aiyara** (this) **majalana** (to be known) **tu** (indeed) **jadayo** (when) **hoti** (becomes). **Mool** (root) **chhejj** (to cut) **prith** (earth) **hoi** (becomes) **bar** (twelve) **maah** (months) **kasaya** (passions).

- **Pangasak 44**

The **sanjwalan kashaya** causes **atichaar** (transgression) in all aspects, but the other twelve **kashayas** destroy the very root of **bat** (existence). 

Page #95:
---------------------------
55
The reason for considering it a "deshghati" (country-destroying) is that even with the rise of "biyantiray" (obstruction of semen), there is still a certain amount of "kshayopasham" (diminution of the subtle "nigodya" (living being) which allows for the intake of "aahar parinaman" (food transformation), "karma nokarma vargana" (categories of karma and non-karma), "gatyanter gaman" (movement in different directions), and "boryalabdhi" (attainment of "borya" (a type of karma)). Due to the rapid "kshayopasham" of the "viriyantaray" karma, there is a deficiency in "virya" (power, strength) from the subtle "nigodya" to the twelfth "gunasthan" (stage of being). This is just a part of the "virya" of a "kevali" (omniscient being). If the "viriyantaray" karma were "sarvaghati" (all-destroying), it would cover up all the "virya" of the living being, making it inert and inactive. Therefore, the "viriyantaray" karma is "deshghati".

Here, "sarvaghati" is described as having 20 and "deshghati" as having 25 "prakritis" (categories), totaling 45. This should be understood in relation to "bandh" (bondage). When considering "uday" (arising), there are 47 "prakritis" when "samyaktva" (right faith) and "misra mohaniya" (mixed delusion) are combined. In these two, "samyaktva mohaniya" is included in "deshghati" and "misra mohaniya" in "sarvaghati" "prakritis". Then there are 21 "sarvaghati" and 26 "deshghati" "prakritis".

1. In the "karmakand" (karma section), "sarvaghati" and "deshghati" "prakritis" are counted in relation to "bandh" and "uday":

"Kevalaanavaranam damanchhatrakam
Kamayay rasyam. Micchan mavadi sammamichche abandhi ||36||"

"Kevalgyanavaran" (obstruction of omniscience), six "darshanavaran" (obstruction of perception) (kevaldarshanavaran, panchanidra), twelve "kashay" (passions) (anantaanubandhi apratyakhyanavaran, pratyakhyanavaran krodh man, maya, lobha), "mithyatva mohaniya" (delusion of falsehood) - these 20 "prakritis" are "madhati" (intermediate). "Savy" (right) "mithyatva" is also related to "uday" and "satta" (existence) states. However, this "dhatri" (category) is only "judi" (related to) "jati" (birth).

"Nanaacharanach ukkam tidansanam
Sammarg me sanjalanam. Jav nokassay vigdham chhanbisa desavadiyo ||40||"

"Gyanavaran chatushk" (fourfold obstruction of knowledge), "darshanavaran trik" (threefold obstruction of perception), "samyakl" (right conduct), "manjvalan" (obstruction of the "kosha" (sheaths)), four "kosha" (sheaths), nine "kashay" (passions), five "antaray" (internal obstructions) - these 36 are "deshghati". 

Page #96:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma Text

**A Detailed Explanation of the Nature of All-Destroying and Country-Destroying Karmas**

Twenty karmas, namely, **Kevalgyanavarana** (veil of omniscience) and others, are **all-destroying** because they completely destroy **Samyaktv** (right faith), **Jnana** (knowledge), **Darshan** (perception), and **Charitra** (conduct). The remaining twenty-five karmas, including **Matijnanavarana** (veil of knowledge), are **country-destroying** because they destroy only a part of these qualities.

The twenty karmas, starting with **Kevalgyanavarana**, completely destroy **Jnana**, **Darshan**, **Samyaktv**, and **Charitra**. The four **Kshayas** (passions) - **Mithyatva** (false belief) and **Anantanubandhi** (infinitely connected) - completely destroy **Samyaktv**. Because when they arise, no one can attain **Samyaktv**. **Kevalgyanavarana** and **Kevaldarshanavarana** completely veil **Kevalgyan** (omniscience) and **Kevaldarshan** (omniscient perception) respectively. The five **Nidras** (sleeps) - **Nidra** (sleep), **Nidra-Nidra** (deep sleep), and others - completely cover the **Darshan** (perception) obtained through the destruction of the **Darshanavarana** karma. The four **Kshayas** - **Apratyaakhyanadharana** (non-rejection) and **Pratyaakhyanavarana** (rejection) - completely destroy **Deshacharitra** (country conduct) and **Sakalcharitra** (all conduct) respectively.

Thus, all these karmas are called **all-destroying** because they completely destroy **Samyaktv** and other qualities. Except for these twenty **all-destroying** karmas, the remaining twenty-five karmas, starting with **Matijnanavarana**, are **country-destroying** because they destroy only a part of **Jnana** and other qualities. This is explained here.

The **Kevalgyanavarana** karma, even though it has the tendency to completely veil the **Atma** (soul) in its true form, it does not completely cover the nature of the soul.

**Sammattatana Dambhana Charitghaittana Ghaiyo. Naslem Demanainanar Purna Desghayo.**
- **Panchasangrah 3.18**

## Translation:

**Shataka**

It is not possible for the **Shataka** to completely cover the **Jiva**. If it were to do so, the **Jiva** would become **Ajiva**, and the distinction between **Jada** and **Chetan** would cease to exist. In other words, the **Jiva** would cease to exist. Just as the light of the sun and moon is not completely extinguished even when covered by dense clouds, the **Shataka** cannot completely cover their light. If it were to do so, the distinction between night and day would also disappear. The scriptures state that even when there is a dense cloud cover, the sun and moon still emit some light. Similarly, even when **Kevalgyan** is completely covered by the **Kevalgyanavaran Karma**, there is still some light, albeit faint, intense, or very intense, which is called **Mati Gyana** etc. This **Mati Gyana** etc. is covered by **Mati, Shruti, Avadhi, and Manparyan Gyanaavaran** in their respective ways, and therefore they are called **Deshghati**.

Similarly, even when **Kevaldarshan** is completely covered by the **Kevaldarshanavaran Karma**, there is still some light, albeit faint, very faint, or specific, which is called **Prabha** and is associated with **Chakshudarshan** etc. This **Prabha** is covered by **Chakshu, Achakshu, or Avadhi Darshanavaran Karma** in their respective ways. Therefore, they are also called **Deshghati** because they cover a part of **Darshan**.

The five **Prakritis** (**Nidra** etc.) cover only a part of the **Darshan** related to **Kevaldarshan** which is not covered by **Kevaldarshanavaran**, but they are called **Sarvaghati** because they completely cover the **Darshanalabdhi** that arises from the **Kshayopa-sham** of **Darshanavaran Karma**.

The **Sanjwalan** and the four **Kshayas** (**Kashaya Chatushk**) and the nine **Kshayas** (**Hasya** etc.) cover the **Charitralabdhi** that arises from the **Kshayopa-sham** of the twelve **Kshayas** because they only cause **Atichara**. 

Page #98:
---------------------------
## The Fivefold Kshaya

The fivefold Kshaya (Panchama Kshaya) are those which destroy the virtues of Samyaktva, etc., and are called "Sarvaghati" (all-destroying). Those which only cause excess are called "Deshghati" (country-destroying).

The Sanjwalan Kshaya only cause excess, while the twelve primary Kshaya destroy the root, meaning they cause a fall from the path of a Vrati (one who has taken vows). However, the Sanjwalan Kshaya, while causing excess in vows, do not completely destroy them, hence they are Deshghati.

The inability to receive, hold, or enjoy a substance, etc., is the subject of Danaantaraaya, etc., Karmas. These substances, which can be received, held, etc., are only a fraction of the infinite number of substances in the world. Therefore, since they destroy a part of Dana, etc., of all substances, Danaantaraaya, etc., are Deshghati.

Just as Matijnanaavaran, etc., are Deshghati because they obstruct a part of knowledge, similarly, Danaantaraaya, etc., are Deshghati because they destroy a part of Dana, etc., related to all substances.

After mentioning the number, names, etc., of the Ghati (destructive) natures, we now discuss the Aghati (non-destructive) natures. Out of the 120 bandhyogya (capable of binding) and 122 udayyogya (capable of arising) natures, 45 and 17, respectively, are Ghati. The remaining 75 natures are Aghati. Their names are indicated in the following verse:

"Aghai, Patan, Yatna, Udhau, Tasvisa, Goyadu, Vanna - eight natures each, the eight Pind (body) natures, the three Tasvisa, Goyadvik, Vedaniyavik, and the four Varna - all these are Aghati natures."

These are all Uttaraprakriti (secondary natures) of name, lineage, Vedaniya (feeling), and Ayukarma (life-span). They keep the Jiva (soul) bound to the cycle of existence, but...

Those that are not capable of causing any harm are called *Aghāto*. Their names are as follows:

(1) **Vedaniya Karma** - Sāta Vedanoaya, Āsāna Vedaniya | (2) **Āyu Karma** - Naraka, Tiryan, Manusya, Deva Āyu |
(6) **Nāma Karma** - Parāghāta, Ucchvāsa, Ātapa, Udyota, Agurulaghu, Tīrthankara, Nirman, Upghāta, Pācha Sharira Audārika, Vaikriya, Āhārak, Tejas, Kārman, Three Angopanga - Audārika Angopanga, Vākraiya Angopanga, Āhārak Angopanga, Six Sansthāna - Samachaturasra, Nyagrodhaparimandala, Svāti, Vāmana, Kubjaka, Huṇḍaṇḍu, Six Sanhanan and Ṛṣabha Nārācha, Ṛṣabha Nārācha, Ardhanārān, Kīlikā, Seva Five Varga - Ekendriya, Dvīndriya, Trīndriya, Chaturindriya, Panchendriya, Four Gati - Naraka, Tiryanch, Manusya, Deva, Vihāyoga Gati - Dvik Shubha Vihāyoga Gati, Ashubha Vihāyoga Gati, Anupūrvi Chatushk - Narakanupūrvi, Tiryanchanupūrvi, Manusyanupūrvi, Devanupūrvi, Lasavīshak (Sa Dashak and Sthāvar Dashak), Varna, Gandha, Rasa, Sparsha.

## Shatak
(4) **Gotr** - Uchcha Gol, Nīcha Gotr.

In the above mentioned names, there are 2 *Vedaniya*, 4 *Āyu*, 67 *Nāma* and 2 *Gotr* karmas. In total, there are 2+4+67+2=75.

After classifying the karmas into *Ghāti* and *Adhāti*, we now divide them into *Puṇya* and *Pāpa* (Shubha, Ashubha, Prashasta, Aprashasta).

## Translation:

**Pātaka**

The five institutions, the second state of hell, the five Mahānana, the Tiryancha, the Amānavedaniya, the Nīcha Gotra, the Upadhāta, the Ekendriya, Vikalendriya, Yantrika, Narakavik, and the sthāvara dashak, the four varna, the forty-five ghāti prakṛtis, all together these are eighty-two pāpa prakṛtis. The four varna are included in both punya and pāpa prakṛtis. Therefore, in punya prakṛtis, they should be understood as auspicious, and in pāpa prakṛtis, they should be understood as inauspicious.

**Special Note:**

In these non-Gāthās, forty-two punya prakṛtis and eighty-two pāpa prakṛtis are mentioned. This classification of punya and pāpa prakṛtis is of the 120 bandha prakṛtis. Although the sum of forty-two and eighty-two is 124, and the bandha prakṛtis are 120, the author explains the reason by saying, "Dosuvi bannāigahā suha asuha." The four varna, namely, varna, gandha, gnya, and sparsa prakṛtis, are both auspicious and inauspicious. Therefore, these four prakṛtis are included in the auspicious form of punya and the inauspicious form of pāpa prakṛtis. This is why the number of punya and pāpa prakṛtis is mentioned as forty-two and eighty-two respectively. If the four varna are not included in both categories, then the number of punya and pāpa prakṛtis will be thirty-eight and seventy-eight respectively. When the four varna prakṛtis are included in one category, then it will be forty-two and seventy-eight or thirty-eight and eighty-two. In this situation, the total will be 120, which is the number of bandha prakṛtis.

After calculating the bandha prakṛtis based on their ghāti and aghāti nature, the reason for calculating them as punya and pāpa is that the prakṛti whose rasa, anubhāga, and vipāka are pleasurable is considered punya, and the prakṛti whose rasa is painful is considered pāpa prakṛti. 

Page #102:
---------------------------
The fifth Karma Granthya is the 'Karma Granthya' of the 'Punyakarma' and 'Papkarma'. The 'Punyakarma' is also called the 'Shubha' or 'Prashastha' nature and the 'Papkarma' is also called the 'Ashubha' or 'Aprashasta' nature. The 'Karma' which binds, its 'Vipak' is not only 'Shubha' or 'Ashubha', but also the 'Jiva's' 'Adhyavasaya' form of 'Karana' is the cause of 'Shubha' and 'Ashubha' both types of 'Vipak'. The 'Vipak' created by 'Shubha' 'Adhyavasaya' is 'Shubha' and the 'Vipak' created by 'Ashubha' 'Adhyavasaya' is 'Ashubha'. The cause of 'Shubha' and 'Ashubha' of 'Adhyavasaya' is the 'Nyunata' of 'Sanklesha', i.e. the 'Parinam' in which 'Sanklesha' is less, that 'Parinam' is more 'Shubha' and the 'Parinam' in which 'Sanklesha' is more, that 'Parinam' is more 'Ashubha'. There is no 'Parinam' which can be definitely called 'Shubha' or 'Ashubha'. Still, the 'Vyavahar' of 'Shubha' and 'Ashubha' should be understood from the perspective of 'Goun' and 'Mukhya' 'Bhaav'. Therefore, the 'Shubha' 'Parinam' from which 'Shubha' 'Anubhag' binds in 'Punyakarma' nature, from the same 'Parinam' 'Ashubha' 'Anubhag' also binds in 'Papkarma' nature. Similarly, the 'Parinam' from which 'Ashubha' 'Anubhag' binds in 'Papkarma' nature, from the same 'Parinam' 'Shubha' 'Anubhag' also binds in 'Punyakarma' nature. 

Page #103:
---------------------------
From the hundred (Shatak) auspicious sections also bind in the virtuous natures. But the point here is that the section arising from auspicious results is excellent and the section arising from inauspicious results is inferior, and the section arising from inauspicious results is excellent and the auspicious section is inferior. This is the reason for the distinction between virtue and vice in the lower natures.

There are both fatal (Ghati) and non-fatal (Aghati) lower natures classified as virtue and vice. Of these, 45 fatal natures are only vice natures because they damage the soul's original nature, but even among the non-fatal natures, 33 natures are vice-like, and four natures like caste (varna) are considered virtuous if they are good and vicious if they are bad. Therefore, 42 natures known as virtuous and 82 natures known as vicious are as follows:

42 Virtuous Natures:

* Suratrika (Devathi, Devanupurvi, Devayau), Manushyanthrika (Manushya Gati, Manushyanupurvi, Manupyayu), High Lineage (Uchcha Gotra), Three Decades (Nas, Yadar, Paryapt Pratyak, Sthir, Shubh, Mubhag, Susbar, Aday, Yash Kini), Five Bodies (Audarik, etc.), Angopaangalik (Audarik Angopaang, Vaikriya Angopaang, Aharak Angopaang), Vanapbhanaraach Sanhanan, Samachaturasra Sansthan, Paraghāt Saptak (Paraghāt, Ucchvās, Ātap, Udyot, Agurulghu, Tirthankar, Nirman), Tiryanchayu, Varnachatusk, Panchendriya Jati, Shubhavihayogati, Sata Vedaniya.

82 Vicious Natures:

* 45 Fatal Natures (Jnanavarana 5, Darshanavarana 6, Mohaniya 26, Antaraya 5), Five Sanhanan except the first, Five Sanhanan, Ashubh Vihayogati, Tiryanchagati, Tiryanchanupurvi, Asata Vedaniya, Neetra Gotra, Upadhat, Ekendriya, Dwindriya, Triindriya, Chaturindriya, Narakgati, Narakanu...

## The Fivefold Karma-Prati

Previously, the ten categories of Naraka (hell) and Stavara (immovable beings) were described: Stavara, Sukshma, Apariapt, Sadharan, Asthir, Ashubh, Dubhang, Duhswar, Anadeya, and Ayasha Kirti. These are the four categories of beings.

1. After describing the nature of punya (merit) and papa (demerit), we now discuss the Pravartan (active) and Apravartan (inactive) karmas. However, due to the fewer number of Apravartan karmas, they are being discussed first.

The Apravartan karmas are: Namdhuvabadhinavagan, Dansan, Pannaan, Digdha, Parghayam, Bhayakuchch, Micchasan, Jin, Gunasisa, and Avariyata. ||18||

6.7
1. In the Panchasangraha, instead of Gubhya (secret) and Papa (demerit) karmas, they are categorized as Prashasta (excellent) and Aprashasta (not excellent) karmas. Hemanumatigam, Devaligam, Tiriya, Usas, Athatanubhagam, Vihagadd, Vannai, Subham, Tasai, Das, Titya, Niman, Chauransausabha, Bhava, Parashaya, Panidi, Agurusha, Ucch, Ujjiya, Ri, Pasastha, Sesa, Basi, and Apasatta. Panchasangraha 321, 22

LA
2. In the Karmaka Ga 41, 42, punya (merit) and papa (demerit) karmas are listed. The count in both texts is the same.

There is a distinction in the number of punya and papa karmas based on the intention of the classification. With a focus on distinction, there are 68 punya karmas and 42 papa karmas, while with a focus on non-distinction, there are 42 punya karmas and 52 papa karmas. In the state of Udaya (arising), with the inclusion of Samyaktva (right faith) and Samyagumiddhyatva (wrong faith), there are 100 karmas with a focus on distinction and 84 with a focus on non-distinction. From the five types of Bandhan (bondage), five types of Sanghata (accumulation), and the twenty categories of Varna (caste) etc., 16 karmas are counted as punya karmas with a focus on distinction and non-distinction, and 16 karmas are counted as papa karmas with a focus on distinction and non-distinction.

## Shataka

**Word Meaning:**

* **Namakarma:** Karma related to name
* **Dhruvabandhimanag:** Nature of Dhruvabandhini
* **Daman:** Darshanavaran (obstruction of perception)
* **Pan:** Five
* **Mag:** Gyanavaran (obstruction of knowledge)
* **Vigdha:** Obstruction
* **Paraya:** Paraghāt (external harm)
* **Bhayakumchhamicchha:** Fear, disgust, and false belief
* **Sapt:** Seven
* **Uchchvas:** Uchchvasa karma (karma related to breathing)
* **Jin Tirthankar:** Tirthankara karma (karma related to becoming a Tirthankara)
* **Gunatisa:** Twenty-nine
* **Apriyata:** Aparaavartaman (non-recurring)

**Verse Meaning:**

The verse lists twenty-nine karmas that are Aparaavartaman (non-recurring). These twenty-nine karmas do not create their own bondage, liberation, or both, but instead prevent the bondage, liberation, or both of other karmas. They are:

* **(1) Mamaran:** Mati (knowledge), Shrauta (scriptural knowledge), Avadhi (clairvoyance), Manaparyaya (telepathy), and केवलज्ञानावरण (obstruction of omniscience)
* **(2) Kashannavarag:** Chakshu (eye), Achakshu (blindness), Avadhi (clairvoyance), and केवल दर्शनावरण (obstruction of perception)
* **(3) Mohaniya:** Fear, disgust, and false belief
* **(4) Namakarma:** Four types of color, Tejas (radiance), Karman body, Agurulaghu (heavy and light), Nirman (creation), Upadhat (support), Paraghāt (external harm), Uchchvas (breathing), and Tirthankara
* **(5) Antaraya:** Dan (charity), Labh (gain), Bhog (enjoyment), Upbhog (consumption), and Veerya (energy)

**Special Meaning:**

The verse mentions twenty-nine karmas that are Aparaavartaman (non-recurring). These twenty-nine karmas do not create their own bondage, liberation, or both, but instead prevent the bondage, liberation, or both of other karmas.

A question arises for the seeker: If false belief is considered an Aparaavartaman karma, then how can it not arise during the liberation of Mohaniya (delusive) and Mishra Mohaniya (mixed delusive) karmas? These two karmas are opposed to the arising of false belief. Therefore, false belief should not be considered an Aparaavartaman karma. 

Page #106:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma Granth

The answer is that the bondage and arising of Mithyatva occurs in the first Gunasthan of Mithyatva, but there is no arising or bondage of Misra Mohaniya and Samyaktava Mohaniya. If these two natures were to remain in the Mithyatva Gunasthan and prevent the arising of Mithyatva while themselves arising, then they could certainly be called antagonistic. But their place of arising is different, meaning Misra Mohaniya arises in the third Gunasthan, Samyaktava Mohaniya arises in the fourth Gunasthan, and Mithyatva arises in the first Gunasthan. Therefore, they do not oppose each other's bondage or arising while residing in the same Gunasthan. This is why Mithyatva is considered Aparaavartaman. Similarly, one should understand about other natures that their bondage, place of arising, or place of bondage and arising is different.

Now, in the following verse, we will explain the Paraavartaman and Kshetravipako natures.

## Paraavartaman and Kshetravipaki Natures

**Tanuattu Bey Vujuyal Kasay Ujjoygoyduag Nidda. Tasakosaau Parisaa Khitarsivaaga'anupuschoo.** ||16||

* Parittaaparaavartaman - Paraavartaman
* Khitarsivaaga - Kshetravipako
* Maanupushveeoo - Four Anupurchas

## Century

**Meaning:** The eight categories of body, three Vedas, two pairs, sixteen passions, Udyotdvikas, Govadvikas, Vedaniyatik, five types of sleep, Usavishak and four lifespans are the pervading natures. The four lifespans are the field-resultant natures.

**Specific Meaning:** The verse mentions the pervading and field-resultant natures.

The pervading natures are called so because they prevent the binding, arising, or both of other natures, and then bind, arise, or both themselves. These include the majority of the natures of Adhati-Vedaniya, lifespan, name, and lineage karmas, along with the natures of Ghatikarma, Darshanavaran, and Mohaniya. Their names are as follows:

(1) Darshanavaran: Nidra, Nidva-Nidra, Prachala, Prachala-Prachala, Syadhi.

(2) Vedaniya: Sata Vedaniya, Asata Vedaniya.

(3) Mohaniya: Anantanubandhi Kashaya Chatushk, Apratyakhyanavaran Kashaya Chatushk, Pratyakhyanavaran Kashaya Chatushk, Sanjwalan Kashaya Chatushk, Hasya, Rati, Shok, Arati, Stri, Purush, Napumsak Ved.

(4) Ayukarma: Narak, Tiryanch, Manusya, Dev Ayus.

(5) Namakarma: 33 natures of the eight categories of body (Audarik, Kriya, Aharak body, Audarik Angopaang, etc., three Angopaang, six Sansthan, six Sanhanan, Ekendriya, etc., five Jati, Narakgati, etc., four Gati, Shubh-Ashubh Bihayogati, four Anupurvi), Atap, Udyot, Vas Dashak, Sthavar Dashak.

(6) Gotrakarma: Uchch Gotra, Nitra Gotra.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

Thus, 5+2+23+4+55+2-1 = 87  natures are **paravartaman** (interacting). Among these, the four **kashayas** (passions) - **anantaanubandhi** (infinitely binding) - and the sixteen **kashayas** (passions) including the four **anantaanubandhi** (infinitely binding) and the five **nidras** (sleeps) are **dhruvabandhini** (permanently binding). Therefore, they do not obstruct other tendencies in the **bandha** (binding) state, but they do obstruct the tendencies of their own kind in the **udaya** (arising) state. This is because only one **kashaya** (passion) arises at a time in a being, for example, only one of the four **kashayas** (passions) - anger, pride, deceit, or greed - can arise at a time. Similarly, when one of the five **nidras** (sleeps) arises, the other four do not arise. Therefore, they are **paravartaman** (interacting).

The four natures - **sthira** (stable), **shubha** (auspicious), **asthira** (unstable), and **ashubha** (inauspicious) - are not **birodhini** (opposite) in the **udaya** (arising) state, but they are **birodhini** (opposite) in the **bandha** (binding) state. This is because **sthira** (stable) does not bind with **asthira** (unstable), and **shubha** (auspicious) does not bind with **ashubha** (inauspicious). Therefore, these four natures are **paravartaman** (interacting). The remaining 66 natures are **paravartaman** (interacting) because they are **birodhini** (opposite) to each other in both the **bandha** (binding) and **udaya** (arising) states.

Thus, the description of the **paravartaman** (interacting) natures has been discussed along with the twelve **dwaras** (gates) as described by the author of the text, starting with **dhruvabandhi** (permanently binding) and ending with **aparaavartaman** (non-interacting). Their details can be found in the table on page 72.

Now, we will discuss the **karma** (action) natures in relation to their **vipak** (result).

**Vipak** (result) refers to the **ramodaya** (enjoyment of the fruits of karma). The power of a **karma** (action) nature to produce specific or diverse fruits and the tendency to produce those fruits is called **vipak** (result). For example, when fruits like mangoes ripen and become ready to eat, they are said to have reached their **vipak** (result). Similarly, when **karma** (action) natures become ready to produce their fruits, it is called their **vipak** (result) state. 

Page #109:
---------------------------
The **karma prakritis** are **pravabandhi**, **avimeva**, **karma prakriti**, **dh**, **y bandhi**, **adhra**, **v bandhi**, **dhra**, **vodaya**, **adhayodaya**, **ch**, **v sattā**, **a**, **sattā**, **sarva prāti deśa ghā**. **Aghatipara** and **apara mogh** are **mohaniya karma** with **samyaktva deśaghani** and **miśra mohaniya sarvaghati**. Both are **paravartaman** and **pap prakriti**. It is important to understand this distinction. 

Page #110:
---------------------------
## Fifth Karma Group

This *vipaka* is of two types - *hetuvipaka* and *rasavipaka*. The nature of *vipaka* - the experience of the fruit - that occurs due to the support of the *hetu* in the form of *pudgala* etc. is called *hetuvipaki*, and the nature of *vipaka* that is manifested due to the support of *rasa*, i.e. the predominance of *rasa*, is called *rasavipaki*.  

Each of these two types of *vipaka* has four sub-categories. Due to the difference in the *hetu* in the form of *pudgala*, *kṣetra*, *bhava*, and *jīva*, there are four sub-categories of *hetuvipaki*, namely *pudgalavipaki*, *kṣetravipaki*, *bhaavipaki*, and *jīvavipaki*. Similarly, there are four sub-categories of *rasavipaka* - *ekasthānak*, *dvisthānak*, *visthānak*, and *cārasthānak*. 

Here, we describe the sub-categories of *pudgalavipaki*, *kṣetravipaki*, *bhaavipaki*, and *jīvavipaki* based on the *hetu* - the location - of the emergence of *rasa* in the karma-natures, i.e. which karma-natures are *pudgalavipaki* etc.

## *Kṣetravipaki* Natures

Of the above four types of *vipaka*, we first describe the *kṣetravipaki* natures: ' *Khittavivagāṇupūvīo* ' - the *ānupūrvī* *nāmakarma* is *kṣetravipaki*. This means that the four natures of *ānupūrvī* *nāmakarma* - *narakānupūrvī*, *tiryachānupūrvī*, *manuṣyānupūrvī*, and *devānupūrvī* - are all *kṣetravipaki*.

**[Verse 1]**
*Duviha vivāgao puṇ he vivāgao rasavivāgao. Ekkekkaavi ya cauhā jao chasado vigappenaṁ.*

**[Verse 2]**
*Jā jaṁ samecca he vibhāga udayam uventi pagaiyo | Tā tabbibāgasannā samsabihāṇāi mugamāi.*

The sky is called a field. The natures that arise in the field are called field-arising (kṣetravipakinī). Although all natures arise in relation to substance, field, time, and emotion, the one that is primarily involved is named after its primary role. The reason for considering the anupūrvīs as field-arising is that they occur in the field. When a living being (jīva) moves for rebirth, the anupūrvīs show their arising (vipaka) in the interval field of the disintegration movement (vigraha-gati). They keep the living being facing its place of origin.

After explaining the field-arising natures, we now discuss the living being-arising (jīvavipaki) and the karma-arising (bhavitavipaki) natures. The living being-arising and karma-arising natures...

...20...

...1 The Digambara and Svetambara sects both consider the anupūrvīs as field-arising. However, they differ in their views on their nature. In the Svetambara sect, when a living being moves to take on a new body after abandoning one, the anupūrvīs move according to the karma series and take the living being to its place of origin in its respective series. The arising of the anupūrvīs is described as "the arising of the tail in hell." (First Karma Text, verse 42)

However, in the Digambara sect, the anupūrvīs maintain the shape of the living being in the disintegration movement, after abandoning the old body and before taking on a new one, similar to the previous body. And its movement is either straight, curved, or both.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

**Verse 75**

**Word Meanings:**

* **Ghanaghai:** The natures of the karmas, destructive karmas.
* **Dugouy:** Two types of Gotra (family).
* **Gobatik:** Two types of Vedaniya (painful).
* **Jina:** Tirthankara (liberated soul).
* **Sasiarati:** Vasatrik (three types of Vasas).
* **Yamatrik:** Yamatrik (three types of Yam).
* **Ithar-sthavaratri:** Sthavaratri (three types of Sthavar).
* **Subhag Bhagavau:** Subhag Chatushk (four types of auspicious).
* **Dur Bhag Bhagavau:** Dur Bhag Chatushk (four types of inauspicious).
* **Sas:** Ucchvas (breathing).
* **Jaiitig:** Jatitrik (three types of Jati).
* **Jiyavivaaga:** Jivavipaki (fruit-bearing in this life).
* **Aau Chauro:** Four types of Ayu (lifespan).
* **Bhavdihana:** Bhavavipaki (fruit-bearing in future life).

**Verse Meaning:**

There are forty-seven destructive karmas, two types of Gotra, two types of Vedaniya, Tirthankara name karma, Vasatrik, Sthavaratri, Subhag Chatushk, Dur Bhag Chatushk, Ucchvas, Jatitrik, these are Jivavipaki karmas, and four types of Ayu are Bhavavipaki karmas.

**Special Meaning:**

The verse mentions the names and types of Jivavipaki and Bhavavipaki karmas.

Jivavipaki karmas are those that show their effects directly in the soul, affecting the soul's knowledge, conduct, etc. Bhavavipaki karmas are those that bind in the present life but show their effects in a future life, after the soul has left the present life and attained a suitable future life.

The verse lists the names and number of Jivavipaki karmas as follows:

* 47 destructive karmas (5 of knowledge and conduct, 1 of darshanavarana, 28 of mohaniya, 5 of antaraya)
* Two types of Gotra
* Two types of Vedaniya
* Tirthankara name karma
* Vasatrik (Tras, Badar, Paryapt)
* Sthavaratri (Sthavar, Sukshma, Aparyapt)
* Subhag Chatushk (Subhag, Muswar, Aadey, Yash Kirti)
* Dur Bhag Chatushk (Dur Bhag, Duhswara, Anaadey, Ayash Kirti)
* Ucchvas name karma
* Jatitrik (Ekendriya, etc.) 

Page #113:
---------------------------
The 78 **Prakritis** are **Jiva-vipaki** (affecting the soul). This is because they directly affect the soul's qualities like **Shān** (knowledge), **Darshan** (perception), and **Indriya** (senses), even without the influence of external factors like **Kshetra** (field of action). For example, the **Jñānāvaraṇa** (veil of knowledge) **Prakriti** makes the soul ignorant, **Darshanāvaraṇa** (veil of perception) **Prakriti** hinders the soul's perception, **Mohaniya Karma** (delusive karma) **Prakriti** destroys the soul's **Samyaktva** (right faith) and **Charitra** (conduct), and the **Five Antarayas** (hindrances) prevent the soul from giving or receiving **Dāna** (charity). Similarly, the **Sāta** (pleasant) and **Asāta** (unpleasant) **Vedaniya** (sensory experiences) **Prakritis** cause the soul to experience happiness or suffering. Therefore, the 78 **Prakritis** mentioned are **Jiva-vipaki**.

The four **Bhavas** (existences) - **Naraka** (hell), **Tiryanch** (animal), **Manushya** (human), and **Deva** (heaven) - are **Bha-vipaki** (affecting the existence). This is because even after the **Bandha** (bond) of the next existence is formed, the **Ayukarma** (karma affecting lifespan) **Prakriti** does not manifest until the soul abandons the current existence and attains its destined existence. Therefore, the **Ayukarma** **Prakritis** are **Bha-vipaki** because they are destined to manifest in the next existence.

Having explained the **Jiva-vipaki** and **Bha-vipaki** **Prakritis**, the next verse will describe the **Pudgala-vipaki** (affecting matter) **Prakritis** and their **Bandha-dvāra** (doors of bondage). To explain this, the different types of **Bandha** (bondage) will be discussed. The **Pudgala-vipaki** **Prakritis** and the different types of **Bandha** are explained in the following verse:

"**Namadhurogya Chautannu Baghayasahaaranier Joyatigam. Puggal Vivaagi Bandho Pahiraspaesassi.**" (Verse 2)

Gādhārth - The twelve Prakritis of Nāmakarma's Dhruvodayī, the four bodies, Upghāt, Sādhāran, Each, Udyotanik, these thirty-six Prakritis are Pudgal Vipāki. Prakṛitibandh, Sthitibandh, Rasabandh and Pradeshbandh are the four types of Bandh.

Firstly, the Pudgal Vipāki Prakritis are listed: 'Nāmadhuvoday' 'Puggal Vivāgi' - the twelve Dhruvabandhini Prakritis of Nāmakarma (Nirman, Sthir, Asthir, Agurulghu, Shubh, Ashubh, Tejas, Karmān, Varnachatusk) and Tanu Chatushk (excluding Tejas, Karmān bodies, the three bodies, three Angopāng, six Sansthān, six Sanhanan), Upghāt, Sādhāran, Each, Udyotanik (Udyot, Ātap, Parāghāt) - these Prakritis are Pudgal Vipāki. Their total number is thirty-six.

These Prakritis bear their fruit in the Pudgal Paramanus that have transformed into the form of the body, hence they are Pudgal Vipāki. For example, the rise of Nirman Nāmakarma regulates the Ang-Upāng in the Pudgal Paramanus that have transformed into the form of the body. The rise of Sthir Nāmakarma makes teeth etc. stable, and the rise of Asthir Nāmakarma makes the tongue etc. unstable. Shubh...

The **Shataka** (hundred) refers to the various karmic influences that shape our physical form and experiences. 

* **Namakarma** (name-karma) at its inception determines the auspicious or inauspicious nature of our head and other body parts. 
* **Namakarma** also governs the formation of our physical body from **pudgala** (matter) and the division of our body into limbs and organs. 
* **Sansthana karma** (establishment karma) shapes the overall form of our body, while **Sanhanana karma** (compaction karma) determines the specific binding of our bones. 
* Similarly, other karmic influences like **Upghāta** (destructive), **Sādharana** (ordinary), and **Pratyeka** (individual) also contribute to the manifestation of our physical form. 

Therefore, the thirty-six karmic influences, from **Nirmāṇa** (creation) to **Parāghāta** (destruction), are all **pudgala-vipāki** (matter-resultant).

Having explained the **kṣetra** (field), **jīva** (soul), **bhava** (existence), and **pudgala-vipāki** (matter-resultant) karmas, we now delve into the specific distinctions of the **viṣaka** (poisonous) aspects of certain karmas.

Although all karmic influences, due to their inherent power of agency and experience, manifest their results in the **jīva** (soul) in some form, **āyu karma** (life-span karma) specifically results in the determination of **bhava** (existence). This is because the **jīva** (soul) is compelled to take birth when **āyu karma** (life-span karma) arises. Similarly, **kṣetra-vipāki** (field-resultant) **ānupūrvī karma** (sequential karma) also guides the soul's journey through the realms of existence, according to its specific nature.

It is important to note that the number of **pudgala-vipāki** (matter-resultant) karmas differs in various texts. The **Karmakāṇḍa** (karma section) lists 62, while the **Karmagrantha** (karma text) lists 26. This discrepancy arises because the **Karmagrantha** excludes **bandhana** (binding) and **saṁghāta** (aggregation) karmas and only considers the four primary **veda** (color) categories, omitting the 20 subcategories. This reduction of 10 + 16 = 26 karmas leaves 62 - 26 = 36 karmas remaining.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

**The nature of the living being, in the form of karma, remains stable.** The qualities of the pudgala create a power in the living being, which causes it to absorb certain types of pudgalas. However, qualities like **kshavipaki** and **adi** are called **kshetravipaki**, **jivatripaki**, etc., due to their primary and special effects on **kshetra** and **jiva**. But there are questions from the inquisitive about the classification of some qualities, and their solutions are presented here.

**Clarification regarding Rati and Ati Mohaniya**

**Rati** and **arati** mohaniya karma are **jivavipaki**. But the inquisitive person asks that since the emergence of these two qualities is due to the influence of pudgalas, they are **pudgalavipaki**. Contact with unpleasant pudgalas like thorns, etc., leads to the emergence of **arati** karma, while contact with pleasant substances like flower garlands, sandalwood, etc., leads to the emergence of **rati** mohaniya karma. Thus, since both emerge due to the connection with pudgalas, they should be considered **pudgalavipaki** and not **jivavipaki**.

**The solution to this is that their emergence occurs even without the connection with pudgalas.** Because even without contact with thorns, etc., the experience of the emergence of **rati** and **arati** karma occurs through seeing, remembering, etc., of pleasant and unpleasant objects. **Pudgalavipaki** is that which emerges only due to the connection with pudgalas. But **rati** and **arati** emerge both due to the contact with pudgalas and without their contact. Therefore, **rati** and **ati** can emerge even without the connection with pudgalas.

## 80
## Century

The arising of the **Jiva** is considered **Jiva-vipaki**, not **Pudgala-vipaki**.

Similarly, **Kshayas** like anger, etc., should also be understood as **Jiva-vipaki**. Just as anger, etc., arises upon hearing words of contempt, which are **Pudgalik**, in the same way, they also arise through **Smriti**, etc., without any connection to **Pudgalas**. Therefore, **Kshayas** like anger, etc., are not **Pudgala-vipaki** but **Jiva-vipaki**.

## Explanation related to **Gati** Karma

**Gati** Karma is **Jiva-vipaki**. The **Jijasa** asks: Just as **Ayukarma** binds the lifespan of a particular **Bhava**, and arises only in that **Bhava**, not elsewhere, similarly, **Gati** Karma also arises in its own **Bhava**. It does not arise in any other **Bhava** besides its own. Therefore, it is reasonable to consider **Gati** Karma as **Bhava-vipaki**, just like **Ayukarma**.

The answer is that there is a difference in the **Vipaka** of **Ayukarma** and **Gati** Karma. Because **Ayukarma**, except for the **Bhava** whose lifespan it binds, does not arise in any other **Bhava** through **Vipaka-udaya**. It also does not arise through **Sthibhuka-samkrama**. For example, the lifespan of a human arises only in the human **Bhava**, not in any other **Bhava**. Therefore, **Ayukarma** is considered **Bhava-vipaki** because it is inseparable from its own designated **Bhava** for its arising. This means that after the binding of **Ayukarma** suitable for any **Bhava**, the **Jiva** must be born in that **Bhava**. However, this is not the case with the arising of **Gati** Karma. Because, even without its own **Bhava**, it can arise in another **Bhava** through **Sthibhuka-samkrama**. 

Page #118:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma Granth

The **Pancham Karma Granth** states that the **udaya** (manifestation) of **karma** occurs through various **parbhavas** (existences). This means that the **karma** bound for different **parbhavas** can manifest in the same **bhavas** through **sancram** (transfer) etc. For example, the **karma** bound for the **parbhavas** of a **charam shariri jeev** (final embodied being) is destroyed in the same **bhavas**. Therefore, **Gati Namakarma** (karma of motion) is not a **bhavavipaki** (determinant of existence) because it does not regulate the **bhavas**.

The implication is that **Ayukarma** (karma of lifespan) is a **bhavavipaki** because it manifests in its own **bhavas**. However, **Gati Namakarma** manifests in its own **bhavas** through **vipako-udaya** (manifestation of the result) and in other **bhavas** through **stibukasancram** (transfer of the residue). Thus, it manifests in both its own and other **bhavas**, making it not a **bhavavipaki**.

**Explanation of the Anupurvi Karma Sambandha**

**Anupurvi Karma** (karma of consequences) is **kshetravipaki** (determinant of the field). However, a curious question arises: since the **vipaka** (result) of **vigrahati** (karma of destruction) manifests through **sancram** (transfer) of **anupurvi**, shouldn't it be considered **jeevavipaki** (determinant of the being) like **Gati**, instead of **kshetravipaki**?

The answer is that **anupurvi** manifests through **sancram** in other places besides its own **kshetra** (field), but its **vipaka** is primarily determined by the **kshetra**. This is not the case with any other type of **karma**. Therefore, the **akash pradesh** (space region) as the **kshetra** is an extraordinary factor in the **udaya** of **anupurvi**, which is why it is considered **kshetravipaki**.

This instrument demonstrates the **kshetravipaki** and other distinctions of **karma**...

**Types of Bond and their Characteristics**

Thus, after classifying the natures into sixteen categories, starting from Dhruvabandi and ending with Pudgalavipāki, we now describe the nature of the bond, etc. First, we explain the types of bond: "Bond is of four types: Nature, State, Rasa, and Region." Their characteristics are as follows:

The specific relationship between the soul and karma atoms, or the soul... 

Page #120:
---------------------------
The act of becoming bound to the five karmic substances and the karmic fields is called **bandha**. Due to the soul's actions driven by attachment and aversion, the **karma particles**, which are unknown and exist in the **ākāśa** fields, are attracted like magnets and become associated with the **ātma** fields. These karma particles are **pudgalic** because they possess form, taste, smell, and touch. The **pudgal** that transforms into form is extremely subtle, like fine dust, which cannot be perceived by the senses. Only a **kevalajnani** or a **param avadhijnani** can know them through their knowledge. 

Just as a person who applies oil to their body and then walks through dust will have the dust stick to their entire body, similarly, due to the **spandan** (vibration), **nāhlan** (movement), and **chalan** (motion) in the **ātma** fields during the state of **samsara** (worldly existence), countless **karma-yogya** (karma-worthy) **pudgal** particles become associated with the **ātma** fields. Just as a red-hot iron ball constantly draws water from its surroundings, similarly, a **samsari** (worldly being) constantly absorbs **karma-pudgal** through their **yoga-pravṛtti** (yogic tendencies). The relationship between the **samsari** and the **karma** particles is like that of fire and water, or a hot iron ball and water. This type of association is called **bandha**.

When the **karma-pudgal** are absorbed by the **jiva** (soul), i.e., when **bandha** occurs, four aspects are created within them, which are called the types of **bandha**. Just as the grass eaten by cows and buffaloes transforms into milk, which then develops a sweet taste, a certain duration for that taste to remain in that form, intensity and mildness in that sweetness, and a certain quantity (weight) of that milk, similarly... 

Page #121:
---------------------------
The four aspects of karma pudgalas, which are taken in by the jiva and combined with the atma-pradeshas, are called prakritibandha, sthitibandha, rasabandh, and pradesabandh respectively. Their characteristics are as follows:

(1) **Prakritibandha**: The emergence of different powers and natures in the karma pudgalas taken in by the jiva is called prakritibandha. Here, the word "prakriti" means nature. According to another definition, prakritibandha is the collective term for sthitibandha, rasabandh, and pradesabandh. In other words, prakritibandha is not an independent bond but simply the name for the collective of the other three bonds.

(a) **Chadbhihe bandhe panṇate, tam jaha—pagabandhe, thiivaghe, aṇubhāvabanne, paesabandhe.**
- Samvāyarāga, Samvāya 4

(b) **Prakriti sthitpanṛbhāgapradeśāstadvidhayaḥ.**
- Tattvārthamūtrama 2. In Digambara literature, the word "prakriti" is only considered to mean nature. **Prakriti svabhāvaḥ, prakriti svabhāvaḥ ity anarthāntaram.**
- Tattvārthasūtra 813 (Sarvārthasiddhi, Rājvārttika ṭīkā)

**Payḍī sīl sahāvo........**
- Gokarmakāra 3 3

**Thiibandho dalams sii paesabandho paesgahaṇam jam. Nāma raso aṇubhāgo tassamudāo pagaibandho.**
- Pañcasampah 432

It should be noted here that in the sense of nature, the meaning of **anubhāga bandha** is only the karma's fruit-producing power, its auspiciousness or inauspiciousness, and its intensity or mildness. However, in the sense of the collective, **anubhāga bandha** includes the karma's fruit-producing power, its auspiciousness or inauspiciousness, and its intensity or mildness. In Vetambara literature, both the meaning of nature and the meaning of the collective are accepted. 

Page #122:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma Granth

**11.  Sthitibandha:** The time limit for karma pudgalas, taken by the soul through the senses, to remain with the soul without abandoning their nature, is called Sthitibandha.

**(3) Rasaband:** The varying potency of karma pudgalas, taken by the soul, to bear fruit is called Rasaband. 
Rasaband is also called **Anubhagaband** or **Anubhavaband**.

**(4) Pradeshband:** The connection of karma skandhas with the soul, with varying numbers of atoms, is called Pradeshband.

**Summary:** When karma varganas, due to the influence of the soul's yoga and kshaya emotions, transform into karma form, they have four aspects: 
1. Their nature, 
2. Their duration, 
3. Their potency to bear fruit, and 
4. Their connection with the soul in a specific quantity. 
These four aspects are called the four types of bandha: **Prakriti, Sthiti, Ras, and Pradesh**. 
Of these, **Prakritibandha** and **Pradeshbandha** depend on the soul's yoga power, while **Sthiti** and the potency to bear fruit depend on kshaya emotions. 

**In other words:** If the yoga power is strong or weak, the karma pudgalas obtained through bandha will have a corresponding nature. 

**Notes:**
1. **Anubhagaband** is particularly prevalent in Digambar literature.
2. **Prakriti** is called nature, **Sthiti** is the time limit, **Anubhag** is Ras, and the number of groups is called **Pradesh**.
3. **Pradeshbandha** is earned through yoga. 

- Panchasangrah 204 

Page #123:
---------------------------
## 86th Century

The nature and quantity of the *svabhava* and *parimana* will also be as intense or as subtle as the *mantra*. Similarly, just as the *kṣaya* emotions of the living being are intense or subtle, the state of the bound atoms and the fruitful power will also be as intense or subtle. This is explained by an example:

Let the *yogaśakti* of the living being be considered as wind, the *kṣaya* as sticky glue, and the *karma* atoms as dust. Just as when the wind blows, dust particles fly and settle on places where there is something sticky like glue, in the same way, *karma* particles flow into the soul from every physical, verbal, and mental action of the living being. These *karma* particles, with the help of the *saṃkleśa* results of the living being, become bound to the soul. Just as the wind is subtle or intense, the dust flies in the same proportion, and the glue, etc., is as sticky as it is, the dust also stays there with the same stability. Similarly, the more intense the *yogaśakti*, the greater the number of incoming *karma* atoms, and the more intense the *kṣaya*, the greater the state and the greater the binding of the *karma* atoms.

To explain the nature of the four types of binding, *prākṛtibandha* etc., the first *karmagrantha* gives the example of *modaka* (sweet balls). The essence of this is as follows:

Just as *modaka* made from substances that destroy *vata* have the nature of destroying *vata*, *modaka* made from substances that destroy *pitta* have the nature of calming *pitta*, and *modaka* made from substances that destroy *kapha* have the nature of destroying *kapha*.

1. *Paṭīrasa esa taṃ cauhā moya-gastha ditā*.
- First *karmagrantha*, verse 2. 

Page #124:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma Granth

The Fifth Karma Granth deals with the destruction of the **Kaf** (phlegm) element. Similarly, the **Karma Pudgalas** (matter particles) absorbed by the soul generate different powers. Some of these powers hinder the soul's **Jnana Guna** (knowledge quality), some obscure the **Darshan Guna** (perception quality), and some suppress the soul's infinite power. This binding of different qualities, powers, and natures within different **Karma Pudgalas** is called **Prakriti Bandh** (nature binding).

Some of these **Karma Pudgalas** have a lifespan of a week, some fifteen days, and so on, during which they retain their inherent nature. This lifespan is called **Sthiti** (duration). Upon completion of **Sthiti**, the **Karma Pudgalas** lose their inherent nature, becoming dull and lifeless. Similarly, some **Karma Dalikas** (groups of Karma particles) remain with the soul for seventy **Koda Kodi Sagaropama** (a unit of time), some for twenty **Koda Kodi Sagaropama**, and so on. This binding of different lifespans, where **Karma Paramanus** (atomic particles of Karma) remain with the soul without losing their inherent nature, is called **Sthiti Bandh** (duration binding). Upon completion of **Sthiti**, these **Karma Paramanus** abandon their inherent nature and separate from the soul.

Just as some sweets have more sweetness, some less, some more bitterness, and some less, similarly, some **Karma Paramanus** have more **Shubh** (auspicious) or **Ashubh** (inauspicious) **Rasa** (flavor), some less. This generation of different intensities of **Shubh** and **Ashubh Rasa** within **Karma Pudgalas**, ranging from **Teer** (intense) to **Teertam** (most intense) and **Mand** (mild) to **Mandtam** (least mild), is called **Rasa Bandh** (flavor binding).

Some sweets weigh two **tola** (a unit of weight), some a **chhatank** (a unit of weight), and so on. Similarly, some **Karma Skandhas** (groups of Karma particles) have a greater number of **Karma Paramanus**, and... 

Page #125:

## 66
The connection of the soul with karma-forces, which are composed of different numbers of karma-atoms, is called *pradeshabandha*. 

This is how one should understand the nature of the four types of bonds, *prakritibandha* etc. Now, in the following verse, we will describe the *ekatibandha* first, explaining the place of the bond in the original natures and the *bhuyaskaara*, *alpantara*, *avasthita*, and *avaktāvya* bonds within them.

**Bonds of the Original Natures: *Bhuyaskaara* etc.**

**I**

*Mūlapraḍīṇa aṭṭasara ṅabandhansu tithi bhūgārā. Adhyatarā tiya cajase avaṭṭiyā ṇa hū avattabbo.* ||22||

**Word Meaning:**

*Mūlapraḍīṇa* - of the original natures, *aṭṭasara ṅabandhansu* - in the bonds of eight, seven, six, and one, *tithi* - three, *bhūgārā* - *bhuyaskaara* bond, *adhyatarā* - *alpantara* bond, *tiya* - three, *cajase* - four, *avaṭṭiyā* - *avasthita* bond, *ṇa hū* - not, *avattabbo* - *avaktāvya* bond.

**Verse Meaning:**

In the bond places of the original natures, eight, seven, six, and one, there are three *bhuyaskaara* bonds. The *alpantara* bond is three, and the *avasthita* bond is four. The *avaktāvya* bond does not exist.

**Detailed Meaning:**

The verse states the number of *bhuyaskaara* etc. bonds along with the bond places of the original karma natures. The bond of karma occurs, and the consideration of their bond place is considered original. There are eight original divisions of karma, namely *jñānāvaraṇa*, *darśanāvaraṇa*, etc., and their bond natures. 

The group of beings that are bound to one bond place at one time is called a *bandhasthāna*, and their subsequent natures are both...

---------------------------
## The Pancha Panchah Karma Granth

This text contains one hundred and twenty verses. This verse only explains the binding places in the original natures. Generally, every living being binds the remaining seven karmas at all times, except for the Ayukarma. This is because the binding of Ayukarma does not happen every moment, but at a fixed time. Therefore, apart from the fixed time of binding of Ayukarma, the binding of the seven karmas continues. When a living being also binds Ayukarma, then it binds eight karmas. In this way, one should understand the two binding places of seven and eight.

Upon reaching the tenth Gunasthan, only the remaining six karmas are bound, except for Ayukarma and Mohaniya karma. This is because the binding of Ayukarma happens only up to the seventh Gunasthan, and the binding of Mohaniya karma happens only up to the ninth Gunasthan. From the tenth Gunasthan onwards, in the eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth Gunasthan, only one Vedaniya karma is bound. The binding of the remaining karmas ceases in the tenth Gunasthan. This is an explanation of the places of binding of six and one karma.

The essence of the above statement is that there are four binding places of the original karma natures: eight natures, seven natures, six natures, and one nature.

**Pancha Panchah 206:**  Until the Aprammatta Gunasthan, seven or eight karmas are bound. In the Sumasampray Gunasthan, six karmas are bound, and in the Upshantamoha, Kshinamaha, and Sayogi Kevali Gunasthan, one Vedaniya karma is bound. In the Lisikaran, Mishra, and Anivritikaran Gunasthan, only seven karmas are bound without Ayukarma. 

Page #127:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**60**

That is, a living being at one time binds one of the eight karmas, or seven karmas, or six karmas, and some living beings bind only one karma at a time. There is no other situation where two or three or four or five karmas are bound together.

**Shataka**

In these four binding places, there are three "Tinni Bhuagara" (Bhuyaskara), three "Appatara Tiy" (Alpatara), and four "Chauro Avattīya" (Avasthita) bindings, but there is no "Na Hu Avattano" (Avaktāvya) binding. Their explanation is being given here.

**Bhuyaskara Agha**

Binding with fewer karmic natures in the first instance and then binding with more karmic natures in the second instance is called Bhuyaskara binding. There are three such bindings in the original natures, which are as follows:

A living being binds one of the seven Vedaniya karmas in the eleventh - Upshanta-moha Gunasthan, and then falls from there and binds six karmas when it reaches the tenth Gunasthan. This is the first Bhuyaskara binding. The same living being, when it falls from the tenth Gunasthan and reaches the lower Gunasthanas, binds seven karmas. This is the second Bhuyaskara binding.

**1** In the Go-Karmakanda, the binding places of the original natures and the Bhuyaskara (which is called Bhujakara there), etc., are described as follows: "Chalarī Niṇitiya Chaḍ Paryāḍidunaṇi Mūlapayḍīṇam. Bhṛjagārapāvarāṇi Ya Avadvivāṇivi Kase Honti ||"

- Go-Karmakanda 453. There are four places, and in these places, there are Bhujakara, Alpatara types of bindings. The word "Ya" indicates the fourth, but this fourth binding is not in the original natures.

- It should not be understood that there are three Avaktāvya bindings in the original natures and the Avasthita. 

Page #128:
---------------------------
The Panchama Karma Granth states that when a soul binds eight karmas, it is the third Bhuyaskaar Bandh. This happens when the time for binding Ayukarma arrives. Thus, there are three Bhuyaskaar Bandhs in the four Bandha sthans due to the binding of one to six, six to seven, and seven to eight karmas.

Apart from these three Bhuyaskaar Bandhs in the four Bandha sthans, it is not possible to imagine three other Bhuyaskaar Bandhs. These three Bhuyaskaar Bandhs are imagined as follows: first, binding one and then binding seven karmas; second, binding one and then binding eight karmas; third, binding six and then binding eight karmas.

Of these three Bhuyaskaar Bandhs, the first two can occur in two ways: 1. with respect to falling, 2. with respect to death. However, the first two Bhuyaskaar Bandhs cannot occur with respect to falling because the fall from the eleventh Gunasthan is gradual, not abrupt. This means that a soul falls from the eleventh Gunasthan to the tenth, then from the tenth to the ninth, and so on. If a soul could fall from the eleventh Gunasthan directly to the ninth or seventh Gunasthan, then the first and second Bhuyaskaar Bandhs could occur by binding one and then binding seven or eight karmas. However, since the fall is gradual, these two Bhuyaskaar Bandhs cannot occur with respect to falling.

Similarly, the third Bhuyaskaar Bandh, which is binding six and then binding eight karmas, also cannot occur. This is because the binding of six karmas occurs in the tenth Gunasthan, and the binding of eight karmas occurs in the seventh and lower Gunasthan. If a soul could fall directly from the tenth Gunasthan to the seventh Gunasthan, then it could bind six and then bind eight karmas. However, since the fall is gradual, this is not possible. 

Page #129:
---------------------------
The author states that a being falling from the tenth **guna-sthana** (state of being) only reaches the ninth **guna-sthana**, and thus cannot create the third **bhuyas-kar** (major) **bandha** (bond).

The essence of the statement is that the fall from a higher **guna-sthana** is not immediate but gradual, occurring through the eleventh, tenth, ninth, etc. Therefore, binding one and then seven karmas, binding one and then eight karmas, and binding six and then eight karmas, do not constitute **bhuyas-kar** **bandhas**.

Now, regarding the possibility of the two **bhuyas-kar** **bandhas** related to death and beginning, a being born in the middle of the eleventh **guna-sthana** only binds seven karmas. This is because the **ayu** (life) **bandha** occurs only when six months of **asu** (life span) remain in the **devagati** (heavenly realm). Therefore, binding one and then eight karmas is not possible in relation to death. Hence, this cannot be a **bhuyas-kar** **bandha**. However, binding one and then seven karmas is possible, but it is important to note that the **bandha-sthana** (place of binding) remains at seven, and therefore it is not considered separate. If there were a difference in the **bandha-sthana**, then it would be considered a **bhuyas-kar**.

If a bound being progresses through the **upshama** (cessation) **shreni** (series) and dies in the middle of a **guna-sthana** or in the eleventh **guna-sthana**, then according to the rule, it is born as an **anuttaravasi** (highest) deva (god).

The author further states that even if one binds seven karmas, the **bandha-sthana** remains the same, and therefore it is not considered separate. If there were a difference in the **bandha-sthana**, then it would be considered a **bhuyas-kar**.

## The Fifth Section of the Granth

**Greater Bandha** is also considered separately. This means that in the aforementioned three Greater Bandhas, by binding six and then seven, a form of Bandha is shown as one Greater Bandha. When one is bound, the form of Bandha of seven remains in the same place as seven, therefore it is not separate. Thus, upon descending from the Upshama श्रेणी, there are only three Greater Bandhas.

**Lesser Bandha** is completely opposite to Greater Bandha. Binding fewer karmas after binding more karmas is called Lesser Bandha. There are also three Lesser Bandhas, just like Greater Bandhas. They are as follows:

When a being binds eight karmas during the time of binding Ayukarma and then binds seven karmas, this is the first Lesser Bandha. In the ninth Gunasthan, when a being binds seven karmas and then binds the remaining six karmas without Mohaniya in the first time of the tenth Gunasthan, this is the second Lesser Bandha. And in the tenth Gunasthan, when a being binds six karmas and then binds one karma in the eleventh or twelfth Gunasthan, this is the third Lesser Bandha. Here too, binding eight and then binding six and one, and binding seven and then binding one, cannot be Lesser Bandhas. Because a being cannot go directly to the eleventh Gunasthan from the Apratmatta and Anivritikaran Gunasthan, nor can it go directly to the tenth Gunasthan from Apratmatta. Therefore, there should be only three Lesser Bandhas.

The difference between Greater and Lesser Bandhas is that Greater Bandhas occur during the fall in Gunasthan, and Lesser Bandhas occur during the ascent. But the ascent and descent in Gunasthan are in order...

**Pātam**

It is not absolute, therefore there are three divisions of both types of bonds. There is no defeat of other options:

After stating the **bhūyas** and **alpatar** bonds in the **mūla karma**, now the **avasthita bandha** is being explained. **Avasthita bandha** is the binding of the same number of karmas in the second time as in the first time. In other words, binding eight karmas and then binding eight again, binding seven and then binding seven again, binding six and then binding six again, and binding one and then binding one again is called **avasthita bandha**. There are four **bandhasthāna**, therefore there are also four **avasthita bandha**.

**Avaktavya bandha** is the binding of no karma and then binding karma again. This bond does not occur in the **bandhasthāna** of **mūla karma**. Because until the thirteenth **guṇasthāna**, there is continuous karma binding, but in the fourteenth **guṇasthāna**, there is no binding of any karma. And after reaching the fourteenth **guṇasthāna**, the jīva does not return to the lower **guṇasthāna**, so there is no opportunity to bind karma again by not binding even a single karma. Therefore, **avaktavya bandha** also does not occur in the **mūla karma** types.

In this way, after explaining the **bandhasthāna** and their **bhūyas** etc. bonds in the **mūla karma** types, now the characteristics of **bhūyas** etc. bonds are being explained in the next verse. The characteristics of **bhūyas** etc. bonds:

**Egādhahige bhūo emāigeri appataro:**
**Tammattosvadvigao ahame samae abtako. ||26||**
**1 Ambandhago na bambai ii asvatto ao naditha.**
**Pañcasangraha 220**

## Fifth Chapter

**Word Meanings:**

* **Egaavalige** - Due to the bondage of one or more karmas.
* **Bhuyaskaar Bandh** - Bondage of more karmas.
* **Egaiuunammi** - Due to the bondage of fewer karmas.
* **Appataro** - Less bondage.
* **Tammaso** - Bondage of the same number of karmas.
* **Avatipao** - Existing bondage.
* **Padmesamae Abandhak** - After the destruction of karmas.
* **Avattayo Avaktvy Bandh** - Bondage that is not spoken of.

**Verse Meaning:**

* **Egaavalige** - Due to the bondage of one or more karmas, there is **Bhuyaskaar Bandh**.
* **Egaiuunammi** - Due to the bondage of fewer karmas, there is **Appataro** bondage.
* **Tammaso** - Due to the bondage of the same number of karmas, there is **Avatipao** bondage.
* **Padmesamae Abandhak** - After the destruction of karmas, and before the re-bondage, there is **Avattayo Avaktvy Bandh**.

**Special Explanation:**

The verse explains the characteristics of **Bhuyaskaar, Appataro, Avatipao, and Avaktvy Bandh**.

* **Bhuyaskaar Bandh** is explained as **Egaavalige Bhuyo** - bondage of one, two, or more karmas. For example, binding six karmas after binding one, binding seven after binding six, and binding eight after binding seven is **Bhuyaskaar Bandh**.

* **Appataro Bandh** is the opposite of **Bhuyaskaar Bandh**. It is explained as **Egaiuunammi Appataro** - bondage of one, two, or fewer karmas. For example, binding seven after binding eight, binding six after binding seven, and binding one after binding six is **Appataro Bandh**.

* **Avatipao Bandh** is explained as **Tammato Bandhvaayo** - bondage of the same number of karmas in each time period. For example, if someone binds a certain number of karmas in the first time period, they bind the same number of karmas in the subsequent time periods.

* **Avattayo Avaktvy Bandh** is the bondage that occurs after the destruction of karmas and before the re-bondage.

**Avashthit Bandha**

Binding the same number of karmas as previously is called Avashthit Bandha. For example, binding eight karmas after binding eight, seven after seven, six after six, and one after one is Avashthit Bandha. Binding any karma after not binding any karma is called Avaktvy Bandha in the first time period - "Padhame Samaye Avattvvo."

**Special Explanation Regarding Bhuyaskaar and Bandhas**

Regarding the four types of Bandhas mentioned above - Bhuyaskaar, Alpatar, and Avaktvy Bandha occur only in the first time period, while Avashthit Bandha occurs in the second and subsequent time periods. For example, if someone binds six karmas and then binds seven, it is Bhuyaskaar Bandha. However, this cannot be Bhuyaskaar in the second time period. Because if in the first time period, seven karmas are bound and in the second time period, eight karmas are bound, then Bhuyaskaar changes. If six karmas are bound, it becomes Alpatar, and if seven are bound, it becomes Avashthit.

**Summary**

The essence of the above statement is that binding more after binding less, binding less after binding more, and binding again after not binding anything is only possible once. However, binding the same number of karmas again as bound in the first time period is possible. Therefore, the same Avashthit Bandha can occur continuously for many time periods, but this is not possible for the other three Bandhas.

**Explanation**

This explanation clarifies the four Bandhas - Bhuyaskaar, Alpatar, Avaktvy, and Avashthit - in the context of Uttar Prakritis, before specifically mentioning their characteristics and the number of times they occur in the root karmas.

There are twenty-nine Bandha-sthans in Uttar Prakritis, which...

**One Hundred**

The eleventh *bhuyaskaar* (increase in karmic bondage) occurs due to the bondage of eleven, the twelfth *bhuyaskaar* occurs due to the bondage of fifty-seven with *jin* nameless and including sleep and *prachala*, and the thirteenth *bhuyaskaar* occurs due to the bondage of fifty-eight with *jin* name. In the *aprammat* (attentive) *gunasthan* (stage of spiritual development), the fourteenth *bhuyaskaar* occurs due to the bondage of fifty-nine with *devayu* (divine life force) added to the aforementioned fifty-eight. In the *deshaviriti* (renunciation of worldly attachments) *gunasthan*, the fifteenth *bhuyaskaar* occurs due to the bondage of sixty karmas, including the twenty-eight *devaprayogya* (divine) karmas, five *gyanavaran* (veil of knowledge), six *darshanavaran* (veil of perception), one *vedaniya* (afflictive), thirteen *mohniya* (delusive), one *devayu*, twenty-eight *namakarma* (name-karma), one *gotra* (lineage), and five *antaraya* (obstructive). The sixteenth *bhuyaskaar* occurs due to the bondage of sixty-one, including the aforementioned sixty and the *tirthankara* name. (Here, it is not possible to bind sixty-two karmas at one time, therefore, it is not called a *bhuyaskaar*.) In the fourth *gunasthan*, the seventeenth *bhuyaskaar* occurs due to the bondage of sixty-three karmas, including five *gyanavaran*, six *darshanavaran*, one *vedaniya*, seventeen *mohniya*, one *gotra*, twenty-eight *namakarma*, and five *antaraya*, when the twenty-eight *devaprayogya* *namakarma* are bound during the *abandhakal* (time of non-binding) of *ayu* (life span). The eighteenth *bhuyaskaar* occurs due to the bondage of sixty-four karmas, including *devayu*. The nineteenth *bhuyaskaar* occurs due to the bondage of sixty-five with *jin* name-karma. In the fourth *gunasthan*, the twentieth *bhuyaskaar* occurs due to the bondage of thirty *manushyaprayogya* (human) karmas by a *dev* (divine being) and the bondage of *gyanamat* (knowledge-based karma). In the *mithyatva* (falsehood) *gunasthan*, the twenty-first *bhuyaskaar* occurs due to the bondage of sixty-six karmas, including five *gyanavaran*, nine *darshanavaran*, one *vedaniya*, twenty-two *mohniya*, one *ayu*, twenty-three *namakarma*, one *gotra*, and five *antaraya*. The twenty-second *bhuyaskaar* occurs due to the bondage of sixty-eight, excluding twenty-five *namakarma* and *ayu*.

## Pancham Karmapanya

The twenty-second **bhuyaskara** occurs when seventy-nine **bandha** are made with **ayu** (life-span) included. The twenty-third **bhuyaskara** occurs when seventy **bandha** are made with twenty-six **prakritis** of **namakarma**. The twenty-fourth **bhuyaskara** occurs when seventy-one **bandha** are made with twenty-eight **prakritis** of **namakarma** without **ayu**. The twenty-fifth **bhuyaskara** occurs when seventy-two **bandha** are made with twenty-nine **prakritis** of **namakarma**. The twenty-sixth **bhuyaskara** occurs when seventy-three **bandha** are made with **ayu** included. The twenty-seventh **bhuyaskara** occurs when seventy-four **bandha** are made with thirty **prakritis** of **namakarma**, along with five **prakritis** of **jnanaavaran**, nine **prakritis** of **darshanavaran**, one **prakriti** of **vedaniya**, twenty-two **prakritis** of **mohaniya**, one **prakriti** of **ayu**, thirty **prakritis** of **nama**, one **prakriti** of **gona**, and five **prakritis** of **antaraya**.

Here, there are many possible **bandha** locations, which should be considered individually. Similarly, twenty-eight **alpatar bandha** occur in reverse order (ascending), and the existing **bandha** should be considered as twenty-nine. **Avaktvy bandha** is not possible. The **jiva** in the **ayogi gunasthan** is free from all **bandha** of **uttar prakritis**. Since there is no possibility of falling from this **gunasthan**, **avaktvy bandha** does not occur.

After describing the **bhuyaskara** and other **bandha** in **uttar prakritis** in general, the following verses will explain the **bandha** of each **karma** in **uttar prakritis**.

**Bandha** of **bhuyaskara** and other **bandha** in **uttar prakritis**:

Nine **prakritis** of **darshanavaran**, six **prakritis** of **darshanavaran**, four **prakritis** of **darshanavaran** as **bandha** locations, two **bhuyaskara bandha**, two **alpatar bandha**, three **bandha**...

**Bound by Circumstances:** Two - two non-expressible bonds, in the Mohaniya karma, twenty-two - twenty-one, twenty-one types of binding places, seventeen - seventeen types of birth, six - six types of now, nine - nine types of, five - five types of, four - four types of, three - three types of, two - two types of, one - one type of binding place, nine - nine types of Bhūyaskaara bonds, eight - eight types of Alpantara bonds, ten - ten types of Avashtita bonds, two - two types of Avaktavya bonds.

**Gāthārtha:** There are three binding places for the nine, six, and four types of Uttar Prakṛtis of the Darshanāvaraṇa karma, and in them there are two Bhūyaskaara, two Alpantara, three Avashtita, and two Avaktavya bonds. There are ten binding places for the twenty-two, twenty-one, seventeen, six, nine, five, four, three, two, and one types of Uttar Prakṛtis of the Mohaniya karma, and in them there are nine Bhūyaskaara, eight Alpantara, ten Avashtita, and two Avaktavya bonds.

**Visheshāyaṁ:** After mentioning the binding places of the Mūla karma Prakṛtis and the number of Bhūyaskaara etc. bonds in them, this Gāthā begins the statement of the binding places and Bhūyaskaara etc. bonds of each karma in the Uttar Prakṛtis.

First, the binding places of the Darshanāvaraṇa and Mohaniya karma and the Bhūyaskaara etc. bonds in them have been counted.

The reason for starting this topic with the Darshanāvaraṇa and Mohaniya karma instead of first mentioning the binding places of the Jñānāvaraṇa karma and the Bhūyaskaara etc. bonds in them, according to the course of the Mūla karma Prakṛtis, is that the Bhūyaskaara etc. bonds are Darshanāvaraṇa, Mohaniya, and Nāma...

## The Fifth Karma Granth

**101** These three karmas (Jnanaavarana, Antaray, and Vedaniya) occur in all five natures, while the remaining five karmas do not have the possibility of occurring in all five natures. This is because Jnanaavarana and Antaray karmas bind and cease simultaneously in all five natures. As a result, both karmas have the same binding location in all five natures. When there is only one binding location, then there is no possibility of further binding like Bhuyaskaar etc. In this situation, the binding remains constant. Similarly, Vedaniya, Ayu, and Gotra karmas bind in only one nature at a time. Therefore, there is no further binding like Bhuyaskaar etc. in these karmas either.

The binding locations and the number of further bindings like Bhuyaskaar etc. in Darshanavarana and Mohaniya karmas should be understood as follows:

**Number of Binding Locations etc. in Darshanavarana Karma:**

Darshanavarana karma has nine natures, namely Chakshudarshanavarana etc.

**1.** Jnanaavarana, Vedaniya, Ayu, Gotra, Antaray.

**2.** (a) **"Tigin dasa atth thanaani sanavaranama hanamanaam. Esthav ya mujagara sesese ya have thana."** - Go. Karmakar 458 - Darshanavarana, Mohaniya, and Nama karma have three, ten, and eight binding locations respectively. Further binding like Bhuyaskaar etc. also occurs in these karmas. The remaining karmas have only one binding location.

(b) **"Bandhatthaga tidastth sanavaranamaohanamanaam. Sesanegam ayattiyabandho savatya thana samo."** - Panchasangrah 223 - Darshanavarana has three binding locations, Mohaniya has ten binding locations, and Nama karma has eight binding locations. The remaining karmas have only one binding location each. The number of binding locations is equal to the number of constant bindings.

**Shataka**

There are three Bandhasthanas (places of bondage) in Darshanavaran, consisting of nine, six, and four types of Prakritis (substances) respectively, known as "Nav Cha Chav Danse". The reason for considering three Bandhasthanas in Darshanavaran Karma is that all nine Prakritis are bound until the second Masadan Gunasthan (state of qualities). At the end of Sasadan Mugsyan, the bondage of Styaanantrik ends. Therefore, from the third Mishr Gunasthan to the first part of the eighth Apoovarnakaran Gunasthan, only the remaining six Prakritis are bound. At the end of the first part of Apoovarnakaran, the bondage of Nidra (sleep) and Prachala (movement) is stopped. Therefore, from the tenth Sookshm Samparay Gunasthan onwards, only the remaining four Prakritis are bound. Thus, the three Bandhasthanas in Darshanavaran are: nine Prakriti form, six Prakriti form, and four Prakriti form.

In these, the Bandhas like Bhuyaskara etc. are in the order of "Dudu Tiddu" - two, two, three, two. This means there are two Bhuyaskara, two Alpatar, three Avashit, and two Avaktvy Bandhas. These are as follows:

When a being binds four Prakritis in any one Gunasthan from the second part of the eighth Apoovarnakaran Gunasthan to the tenth Sookshm Samparay Gunasthan, and then falls down from the second part of Apoovarnakaran Gunasthan and binds six Prakritis, then the first Bhuyaskara Bandha occurs. When it falls further from there and binds nine Prakritis, 

**Note:** The three Bandhasthanas of Darshanavaran are also mentioned in the same way in the Sapta Tika Adhikar of Panchasangrah.

**Nav Swaha Bajai Gath Basmen Sanavaranam ||10**

There are three Bandhasthanas in Darshanavaran. In the first and second Gunasthan, there is a bondage of nine Prakritis. Further, from the eighth Gunasthan onwards, there is a bondage of six Prakritis, and from the tenth Gunasthan onwards, there is a bondage of four Prakritis. 

Page #140:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma Granth

Then there is the second **bhuyaskaar bandh**. In this way, two **bhuyaskaar bandh** should be understood in the **uttar prakritis** of the **darshanavaran karma**.

Like the **bhuyaskaar bandh**, two **alpatar bandh** should also be understood in the **uttar prakritis** of the **darshanavaran karma**. Because **alpatar bandh** are opposite to **bhuyaskaar bandh**. Therefore, when a being, after binding nine **prakritis** in the lower **gunasthanas**, binds **paag** in the third **dimasthan**, then the first **alpatar bandh** occurs. And when it binds six and then four, then the second **alpatar bandh** occurs.

But there are three **avasthit bandh**. Because there are only three **bandasthanas** for **darshanavaran karma**, and two **avaktavy bandh** should be understood in this way: When a being, after completely binding **darshanavaran** in the eleventh **gunasthan**, falls from there and binds four **prakritis** in the tenth **gunasthan**, then the first **avaktavy bandh** occurs. And when it dies in the eleventh **gunasthan** and is born as a **dev** according to its **karma**, then it binds six **prakritis** of **darshanavaran karma** in the first moment, which is the second **avaktavy bandh**.

After explaining the **bandasthanas** of the **uttar prakritis** of **darshanavaran karma** and the two **bhuyaskaar**, two **alpatar**, three **avasthit**, and two **avaktavy bandh** in them, now we will explain the **bandasthanas** and **bhuyaskaar** etc. **bandh** of the **uttar prakritis** of **mohaniya karma**.

The number of **bandasthanas** etc. of **mohaniya karma**... There are twenty-eight **uttar prakritis** of **mohaniya karma**. But since **samyagmithyatva** and **samyakta mohaniya** are not bound, there are twenty-six **prakritis** that can be bound. In these, there are ten **bandasthanas** in total, with twenty-two, twenty-one, seventeen, thirteen, nine, five, four, one, two, and one **prakritis** respectively. They are as follows:

**Chapter**

Out of the three *vedas* (female, male, and neuter), only one *veda* is bound at a time, and out of the two pairs of *hasya-rati* and *shoka-arati*, only one pair is bound at a time. Therefore, out of the twenty-eight types of *mohaniya karma*, by reducing two *vedas* from the three *vedas* and one pair from the two pairs of *hasya-rati* and *shoka-arati*, a total of six types are reduced, leaving twenty-two types that can be bound at a time. This is the first *bandha-sthana* (place of bondage).

The twenty-two types of this *bandha-sthana* are as follows:

* *Mithyatva*
* *Ananta-anubandhi*
* *Kshaya* (four types)
* *A-pratyakhyana-avaran* *Kshaya* (four types)
* *Pratyakhyana-avaran* *Kshaya* (four types)
* *Sanjvalana* *Kshaya* (four types)
* One *veda*
* One pair
* *Bhaya* (fear)
* *Jugupsa* (disgust)

This *bandha-sthana* of twenty-two types is bound only in the first *guna-sthana* (state of being).

In the second *guna-sthana*, all twenty-one types except *mithyatva* are bound. In the third and fourth *guna-sthana*, seventeen types are bound, excluding *ananta-anubandhi* *krodha* (anger), *mana* (pride), *maya* (delusion), and *lobha* (greed). In the fifth *guna-sthana*, thirteen types are bound, excluding the four types of *a-pratyakhyana-avaran* *kshaya*. These are the second, third, and fourth *bandha-sthana*, respectively.

After this, in the sixth, seventh, and eighth *guna-sthana*, only nine types are bound due to the absence of the four types of *pratyakhyana-avaran* *kshaya*. At the end of the eighth *guna-sthana*, *hasya*, *rati*, *bhaya*, and *jugupsa* are unbound, leaving only five types bound in the first part of the ninth *guna-sthana*. In the second part, due to the absence of the *veda*, only four types are bound. In the third part, due to the absence of the *sanjvalana* *krodha*, only three types are bound. In the fourth part, due to the absence of the *sanjvalana* *mana*, only two types are bound. In the fifth part, due to the absence of the *sanjvalana* *maya*, only one type, *sanjvalana* *lobha*, is bound.

This is the bond. Further, due to the absence of the *badar* *kṣaya*, the bond of the *sanjvalana* *lobha* nature also does not occur. Thus, one should know the ten bond-places of the *mohaniya* karma. Among these ten bond-places, there are nine *bhūyas* bonds, eight *alpatar* bonds, ten *avasthita* bonds, and two *avakatavya* bonds. Their explanation is given below.

**The *bhūyas* etc. bonds of *mohaniya* karma:**

When one bond is made, and then two bonds are made, the first *bhūyas* bond occurs. When two bonds are made, and then three bonds are made, the second *bhūyas* bond occurs. Similarly, when three bonds are made, and then four bonds are made, the third *bhūyas* bond occurs. When four bonds are made, and then five bonds are made, the fourth *bhūyas* bond occurs. When five bonds are made, and then nine bonds are made, the fifth *bhūyas* bond occurs. When nine bonds are made, and then thirteen bonds are made, the sixth *bhūyas* bond occurs. When thirteen bonds are made, and then seventeen bonds are made, the seventh *bhūyas* bond occurs. When seventeen bonds are made, and then twenty-one bonds are made, the eighth *bhūyas* bond occurs. When twenty-one bonds are made, and then twenty-two bonds are made, the ninth *bhūyas* bond occurs.

**The eight *alpatar* bonds are as follows:**

When twenty-two bonds are made, and then twenty-three bonds are made, the first *alpatar* bond occurs. When twenty-three bonds are made, and then twenty-four bonds are made, the second *alpatar* bond occurs. When twenty-four bonds are made, and then twenty-five bonds are made, the third *alpatar* bond occurs. When twenty-five bonds are made, and then twenty-six bonds are made, the fourth *alpatar* bond occurs. When twenty-six bonds are made, and then twenty-seven bonds are made, the fifth *alpatar* bond occurs. When twenty-seven bonds are made, and then twenty-eight bonds are made, the sixth *alpatar* bond occurs. When twenty-eight bonds are made, and then twenty-nine bonds are made, the seventh *alpatar* bond occurs. When twenty-nine bonds are made, and then thirty bonds are made, the eighth *alpatar* bond occurs.

**Footnotes:**

1. In the *Go karmakāṇḍa*, there is some difference in the *bhūyas* etc. bonds of *mohaniya* karma. There are more bonds mentioned in it, whose details are given in the appendix.

2. There are eight *alpatar* bonds of *mohaniya* karma. The reason for not mentioning the bond of twenty-two bonds and then twenty-one bonds as an *alpatar* bond is that the bond of twenty-two bonds occurs in the first *guṇasthāna*, and the bond of twenty-one bonds occurs in the second *guṇasthāna*. But the living being does not go from the first *guṇasthāna* to the second *guṇasthāna*. The second *guṇasthāna* is with respect to *akrānti*, not with respect to *utkrānti*. If the living being could go from the first *guṇasthāna* to the second *guṇasthāna*, then the bond of twenty-one bonds could have become an *alpatar* bond. But due to *mithyādṛṣṭi*, the living being...

**106**

When a bond of 100 is made, it is the first *alpantar* (minor bond). When a bond of 17 is made after a bond of 100, it is the second *alpantar*. Similarly, when a bond of 9 is made after a bond of 13, it is the third *alpantar*. When a bond of 5 is made after a bond of 9, it is the fourth *alpantar*. When a bond of 4 is made after a bond of 5, it is the fifth *alpantar*. When a bond of 3 is made after a bond of 4, it is the sixth *alpantar*. When a bond of 2 is made after a bond of 3, it is the seventh *alpantar*. When a bond of 1 is made after a bond of 2, it is the eighth *alpantar*.

There are ten *bandhasthana* (places of bondage) due to *dama* (control). Therefore, there are also ten *avasthan* (states) of bondage.

There are two types of *avaktavy* (unspeakable) bonds:

1. When a being, without making a bond of *mohaniya karma* (karma that causes delusion) in the eleventh *gunasthan* (stage of spiritual development), falls from there to the ninth *gunasthan* and makes a bond of *sanjwalan lobha* (burning greed), it is the first *avaktavy* bond.

2. When a being, due to the depletion of *ayu* (life span) in the eleventh *gunasthan*, dies and takes birth in the *anuttaravasi deva* (highest order of gods) and makes a bond of seventeen *prakritis* (types of karma), it is the second *avaktavy* bond.

*Dan* (giving) cannot lead to *samyagdristi* (right faith). Only *upasham samyagdristi* (right faith with control) can attain the *sasadan gunasthan* (stage of spiritual development).

**23**

No one can attain *sasadan* (stage of spiritual development) by *chaligeme* (wrong conduct). A person who is *samsammatta* (self-controlled) and has *dhatu* (spiritual power) can attain *sasadan* by *chaligeme* only if they are *samsammatta* (self-controlled) and have *dhatu* (spiritual power). If someone attains *sasadan* by *chaligeme* without being *samsammatta* (self-controlled) and having *dhatu* (spiritual power), they will not be able to maintain it.

**-Karmaprakriti (Upasham)**

During the time of *upasham samyaktva* (right faith with control), a person can attain *sasadan samyaktva* (right faith with control and spiritual development) with a minimum of one and a maximum of six *apali* (remaining karmas). Therefore, a bond of 21 after a bond of 22 is a possible *alpantar* (minor bond).

**Form, 28 Nature Forms and 29 Nature Forms, these become five locations and three bondage locations are respectively 30 Nature Forms, 31 Nature Forms and one Nature Form. Their explanation is as follows:**

There are 67 Nature Forms that are capable of being bound by Name Karma. At one time, not all Nature Forms are bound to a single Jiva. Only 23, 25, etc. Nature Forms are bound to a Jiva at one time. Therefore, eight bondage locations of Name Karma are considered.

The bondage locations of Karma mentioned earlier are Jiva-vipaki - they affect the spiritual qualities of the Jiva. But the majority of Name Karma is Pudgala-vipaki and it is mostly used in the physical structure of Jivas. Therefore, due to the difference in different Jivas, there is a difference in the same bondage location in the Abantar Nature Forms.

**Varna Chatushk, Tanjas, Karman, Agurulghu, Nirman and Upghāt, these nine Nature Forms of Name Karma are Dhruva-bandhini.** These are bound to all Jivas of all four Gatis until the sixth part of the eighth Gunasthan. Along with these, **Tiryanch-gati, Tiryanch-anupurvi, Ekendriya jati, Audarik sharir, Hund sansthan, Sthavar, Aparapt, Asthir, Ashubh, Durbhāg, Anadeya, Ayash-kirti, Sukshma-badar, one from each of these fourteen Nature Forms, and one from each of the ordinary Nature Forms, when combined with the nine Dhruva-bandhini Nature Forms (14+6), result in the bondage location of 23 Nature Forms.** These 23 Nature Forms are Aparapt Ekendriya-prayogya, which are bound by Ekendriya, Vikalendriya and Panchendriya Mithyatvi. That is, the Jiva bound to this location is born as an Aparapt Ekendriya after death.

**From these 23 Nature Forms, by reducing the Aparapt Nature Form to Paryapt, ...**

## The Fifth Karma Granth

By combining the Ucchvas and Paraghat natures with the one-sensory sufficient, a twenty-five-fold bondage-place with one-sensory sufficient is formed. By subtracting the stationary, sufficient one-sensory species, Ucchvas and Paraghat from these, and adding the Vas, insufficient two-sensory species, Sevat Sanhanan and Audarik Angopang, a twenty-five-fold place with two-sensory insufficient is formed. Similarly, by adding the three-sensory species in place of the two-sensory species, a twenty-five-fold place with three-sensory insufficient is formed. By adding the four-sensory species in place of the three-sensory species, a twenty-five-fold place with four-sensory insufficient is formed. And by adding the five-sensory species in place of the four-sensory species, a twenty-five-fold place with five-sensory insufficient is formed. In this, by adding the human path in place of the Tiryanch path, a twenty-five-fold place with human insufficient is formed.

Thus, the twenty-five-natured bondage-place is of six types, and the beings bound by it can take birth in all the insufficient Tiryanch and humans, starting from the one-sensory sufficient and the two-sensory.

From the twenty-five-natured bondage-place with human path, by subtracting the Vas, insufficient, human path, five-sensory species, Sevat Sanhanan and Audarik Angopang, and adding one of the stationary, sufficient, Tiryanch path, one-sensory species, Ucchvas, Paraghat, Atap and Udyot, a twenty-six-fold bondage-place with one-sensory sufficient is formed. The bound being of this place takes birth in the one-sensory sufficient.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

**111**  Nine Dhruvabandhini, Bas, Badar, Paryapt, Pratiyaka, Sthira. These are unstable, auspicious or inauspicious, Adeya. Yash-Kirti or Ayash Kirti, Devagati, Panchendriya jati, Vaikriya' Sharira, Pratham Sansthan, Devanupurvi, Vaikriya Angopaang, Suswar, Prashast Bihayogati, Uchchwas, Paraghāt, Tirthankar. These twenty-nine, including Devagati and Tirthankar, are the Bandhastanas of these natural forms. Thus, there are six Bandhastanas of twenty-nine natural forms. The bound being in these places is born in the Dwindriya, Triindriya, Chaturindriya and Panchendriya Tyanchons, as well as in the Manushya Gati and Devagati.

Dwindriya, Triindriya, Chaturindriya and Panchendriya Paryaptayut twenty-nine have four Bandhastanas. By combining them with the Udyot Prakriti, there are twelve Bandhastanas of thirty, with Dwindriya, Triindriya, Chaturindriya and Panchendriya Paryaptayut. By combining the Tirthankar jati with the twenty-nine Bandhastanas, including the Paryapt Manushya, there is a Bandhastan of thirty, including the Manushya Gati. By subtracting the Tirthankar Prakriti from the twenty-nine Bandhastanas, including the Devagati, and adding the Aharakdwik, there is a Bandhastan of thirty, including the Devagati. Thus, there are six Bandhastanas of thirty natural forms.

By adding the Aharakdwik to the twenty-nine Bandhastanas, including the Devagati, there is a Bandhastan of thirty-one, including the Devagati. In one natural Bandhastan, only one Yashasiti is bound.

Thus, having explained the eight Bandhastanas of the Namkarma, now we will explain the number of Bhuyasakar Bandha etc. in them.

**Bhuyasakarādi Bandha**

There are eight Bandhastanas of Namkarma, and to explain the number of Suchaksarādi Bandha in them, a hint is given: 'Chalsagati Bandha' - there are six Bhuyasakar, Mat Alpatar, eight Avasthit and three Abaktvy Bandha. Their description is as follows: 

Page #149:
---------------------------
## 112th Century

Binding 23 and then binding 25 is the first *bhuyaskaar* binding, binding 25 and then binding 26 is the second *bhuyaskaar*, binding 26 and then binding 28 is the third *bhuyaskaar*, binding 28 and then binding 29 is the fourth *bhuyaskaar*, binding 29 and then binding 30 is the fifth *bhuyaskaar*, binding 30 and then binding 31 with *aaharaka-dvik* is the sixth *bhuyaskaar* binding. Thus, there are six *bhuyaskaar* bindings.

In the ninth *gunasthan*, when a being, after being expelled from there by killing one, binds 30 or 31 in the eighth *gunasthan*, it is not considered a separate *shrayaskara*. Because in that case also, it binds 30 or 31, and this same binding occurs in the fifth and sixth *bhuyaskaar* bindings, therefore it is not considered separate.

Although in the commentary of *Karma-prakriti* *Satvaadhikara* verse 52, Upadhyay Yashovijayaji, while describing the binding places of karmas and the *bhuyaskaar* etc. bindings in them, has mentioned one opinion regarding the seventh *bhuyaskaar* in the binding places of *naamakarma*, that binding 31 after binding one *prakriti* is the seventh *bhuyaskaar* binding. As it is written in *Shataka Churni*, "One and thirty-one, then *bhuyaskaar* seven" - binding one and then binding 31, therefore there are seven *bhuyaskaar* bindings in the later *prakritis* of *naamakarma*.

The answer to this is that while describing the *bhuyaskaars* of binding places like 28 etc., the *bhuyaskaar* in the form of binding 31 has already been included. Therefore, it cannot be considered separate from the perspective of one. 

Page #150:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma Granth

Here, the distinction of *bhuyaskaars* is not explained in relation to different *bandha sthans*. If the distinction is explained in relation to different *bandha sthans*, then there will be many *bhuyaskaars*. For example, sometimes one binds 28 and then binds 31, sometimes one binds 29 and then binds 31, sometimes one binds 1 and then binds 31, sometimes one binds 23 and then binds 28, and sometimes one binds 25 and then binds 28. In this way, there can be many *bhuyaskaars*, more than seven, which are not desirable here. Therefore, the distinction of *bhuyaskaars* is not explained in relation to different *bandha sthans*. In this way, there are six *bhuyaskaars* and *bandha*.

Now, we will explain seven *alpatar bandhas*. When a being, capable of attaining *devagati*, binds 28, 2, 30, or 31 in the *gunasthan* of *apuurvakaran*, and then binds the first *prakritik bandha sthan*, it is called the first *alpatar bandha*. When a being, including *aaharaka* and *tirthankara*, binds 31 and is born in *devlok*, it binds 30 *prakritis* in the first instance, which is called the second *alpatar bandha*. When the same being falls from heaven and takes birth in the human realm, and then binds 29 *prakritis*, including *tirthankara*, capable of attaining *devagati*, it is called the third *alpatar bandha*. When a *tithankara* or a human being, capable of attaining *tithankaragati*, binds the aforementioned 29 *prakritis* and then binds 28 *prakritis* capable of attaining *devagati* due to pure *parinaamas*, it is called the fourth *alpatar bandha*. When a being, having bound 28 *prakritik bandha sthans*, binds 26 *prakritis* capable of becoming *ekendriya* due to *sanklesha parinaamas*, it is called the fifth *alpatar bandha*. When one binds 26 and then binds 25, it is called the sixth *alpatar bandha*. And when one binds 25 and then binds 23, it is called the seventh *alpatar bandha*. 

Page #151:
---------------------------
## Chapter 4

**Regarding the eight Bandha-sthānas, there are only eight Bandhas present.**

When a Jīva, having shed all the Nāmakarma Prākrtis in the eleventh Guṇasthāna, binds a single Prākriti, it is called the first Avaktavyabandh. When a Jīva, having died in the eleventh Guṇasthāna and taken birth in the Anuttar Devās, binds thirty Prākrtis suitable for the Manusshyagati, it is called the second Avaktavyabandh. And when it binds twenty-nine Prākrtis suitable for the Manusshyagati, it is called the third Avaktavyabandh. Thus, there are three Avaktavyabandhas.

In the first three stanzas of this Gāthā, the Bandha-sthānas of Nāmakarma and the Bhūyaskaara etc. Bandhas within them have been described. In the fourth stanza, a hint is given to explain the Bandha-sthānas of the remaining Karmas, by saying, "There is only one Bandha-sthāna for each of the remaining five Karmas - Jñānāvaraṇa, Vedaniya, Āyu, Gotra, and Antarāya." This is because the five Prākrtis of Jñānāvaraṇa and Antarāya are bound together and cease together. Similarly, in the Uttar Prākrtis of Vedaniya, Āyu, and Gotra Karmas, only one Prākriti is bound at a time. Therefore, there are no Bhūyaskaara etc. Bandhas in these Karmas. Because where only one Prākriti is bound, it is not possible to bind a few Prākrtis and then bind more, or to bind more Prākrtis and then bind fewer.

———.

**1** In the Karmakāṇḍa Gāthās 165 to 582, the Bhūyaskaara etc. Bandhas of Nāmakarma have been discussed in detail. In these Gāthās, the Bhūyaskaara etc. Bandhas have been explained in relation to the Guṇasthānas. The number of Prākrtis that can be bound, the number of Prākrtis that can be released, and the number of Bhangas that can occur in each of these Prākrtis, have all been explained in relation to the Bhūyaskaara etc. Bandhas.

Page #152:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma

**115**

This is a general rule, but except for Vedaniya karma, the remaining four karmas have both Avaktāvya and Avashthit Bandha. Because when a being, without binding the karma of Jnanaavaran, Antaray, and Gotra karma, falls from the eleventh Gunasthan and binds those karmas again in the lower Gunasthan, then in the first instance, it is Avaktāvya Bandha, and in the second and subsequent instances, it is Avashthit Bandha. Similarly, when Ayush karma is bound in the Vibhaga, then in the first instance, it is Avaktāvya Bandha, and in the second and subsequent instances, it is Avashthit Bandha. However, in Vedaniya karma, only Avashthit Bandha occurs, not Avaktāvya Bandha. Because the Abandha of Vedaniya karma occurs in the Aayogi Kevali Gunasthan, but since the being does not fall from there to the lower Gunasthan, there is no re-binding.

Thus, the binding places and their Bhuyaska, etc., bindings in the 120 Uttar Prakritis, which are eligible for binding of karma, have been explained. Their table is given on page 116. After describing Prakriti Bandha, the next verses describe Sthiti Bandha.

**The Excellent and Inferior Sthiti Bandha of the Root Karmas**

**Verse 17**

Thirty Kodakodi Sagaropama for the remaining four karmas, including the Sagaropama Nirpasurajanminaraka and the lifespan of Devas. 

Leaving out the Muttam, the Akashayi, the Akashayi's Vedaniya karma has a Jghana state of twelve Muhurtas. The Nama and Gotra karma have eight Muhurtas each, and the remaining five karmas have a Jghana state of Antarmuhurta.

**Verse 117**

**Gathaarth:** The excellent state of Nama and Gotra karma is twenty Kodakodi Sagaropama. The Mohaniya karma has seventy Kodakodi Sagaropama, the remaining four karmas have thirty Kodakodi Sagaropama, and the lifespan of Naraka and Devas is thirty-three Sagaropama.

**Vishesharth:** These two verses describe the excellent and Jghana states of the eight fundamental karmas. Instead of listing the karmas in order, karmas with similar states are grouped together and their state is described. For example, since the state of Nama and Gotra karma is the same, they are grouped together and it is said, "Veesyar Kodakodi Name 'Goe' - The excellent state of Nama and Gotra karma is twenty Kodakodi Sagaropama." "Teesyar Chausu Udhi - The state of the four karmas is thirty Kodakodi Sagaropama." However, the names of these four karmas are not mentioned in the Gatha. This is because the state of Nama and Gotra karma is mentioned separately. 

Page #155:
---------------------------
A century has passed and the state of Mohaniya Karma has been described as 'Sattari Mohe' which means the highest state of Mohaniya Karma is seventy Kodakodi Sagaropama. And 'Niryasuraunmi Tittisa' describes the highest state of Ayukarma as thirty-three Sagaropama. Therefore, from these names, gotra, Mohaniya and Ayukarma, the remaining four karmas, namely, Jnanavaran, Darshanavaran, Vedaniya and Antaraya, should be understood to be in the state of thirty Kodakodi Sagaropama.

After describing the highest state of the eight karmas, including Jnanavaran, etc., it is said that 'Bar Muhutta Jahann Veyanie' is the lowest state of Vedaniya Karma, which is twelve Muhurta. 'Att Nam Goesu' is the lowest state of name and gotra karma, which is eight Muhurta. And from these, the remaining five karmas, namely, Jnanavaran, Darshanavaran, Mohaniya, Ayu and Antaraya, have the lowest state of Antamuhurta.

The essence of the above statement is that the highest state of Dhaatikarma, Jnanavaran, Darshanavaran, Antaraya is thirty Kodakodi Sagaropama, the highest state of Mohaniya is seventy Kodakodi Sagaropama, and the highest state of Aghatikarma, Vedaniya is thirty Kodakodi Sagaropama, Ayu is thirty-three Sagaropama, and name and gotra is twenty Kodakodi Sagaropama. And the lowest state is as follows:

There are five Muhurtas for Jnanavarana, Darshanavarana, Mohaniya and Antaray, twelve Muhurtas for Vedaniya, one Muhurta for Ayus, and eight Muhurtas each for Name and Gotra.

The main cause of Sthitibandha is Kshaya. When the intensity of the complex results arising from Kshaya is high, there is a binding of the superior state, and when the Kshaya results are weak, there is a binding of the inferior state, and when the results are moderate, there is a binding of the moderate state.

Although it should have been described after the Prakritibandha, the description of its owner in the commentary on Vangaswamitva has been elaborated, so it is not repeated here and Sthitibandha is explained.

The Karma that remains attached to the soul for a certain period of time after it is bound is called Sthitibandha. After Karma is bound, it does not immediately start giving its fruits, nor does it give its full fruits all at once. But it starts giving fruits in due course and gradually destroys its power. The statement of Sthitibandha is made to indicate the maximum and minimum time limits for the Karma to remain connected with the soul from the time of its binding to the time of its destruction. Maximum

## 120th Century

The highest state of the time-limit is called the excellent state and the lowest state of the time-limit is called the despicable state. In the above two verses, the eight karmas, starting with knowledge-obscuration, have been described as excellent and despicable states. Between these excellent and despicable states, there are many types of intermediate states due to the ability of the living beings to strive. The excellent state of the eight karmas, starting with knowledge-obscuration, is so high that it is impossible to describe it by numerical evidence. Therefore, it has been described by a simile, a type of evidence, called the "ocean simile". The amount that comes from multiplying one crore by one crore is called "kodakodī". The excellent state of the remaining seven karmas, except for the lifespan karma, has been described by the "kodakodī ocean simile". Lifespan karma is the only karma whose state is described not by the "kodakodī ocean simile" but by the "mif ocean simile". Also, there is a special feature in describing the excellent state of lifespan karma, that the excellent state of its two divisions, "narakāyu" and "devāyu", has also been described. The reason for this is that the excellent state of the original lifespan karma is the same as the excellent state of "narakāyu" and "devāyu". Therefore, from the perspective of the "Granthaladhav", the excellent state of the original lifespan karma has not been described separately, but it has been described through two types of consequences, along with the excellent state of those two consequences.

The emergence of passions occurs only up to the tenth subtle-state of the "guṇasthāna". Therefore, there is a state of bondage of karmas up to that point. Living beings up to the tenth "guṇasthāna" are called "sakṣaya" (with passions) and living beings from the eleventh to the fourteenth "guṇasthāna" - "upasāntamoha" (calm passion), "kṣīṇamoha" (diminished passion), "saghomikevalī" (perfect being with a body), "ayogikevalī" (perfect being without a body) - are called "akṣaya" (without passions). Out of the eight karmas, only one karma, the "vedanīya" karma, is...

## The Fifth Karma Text

**121**

Akṣaya jivas are bound by Vedaniya karma, while the remaining seven karmas bind only Sakṣaya jivas. Akṣaya jivas experience Vedaniya karma in only two moments: first, the moment of binding, and second, the moment of experiencing and shedding it. Therefore, when discussing the severity of karmas, the twelve-muhūrta severity of Vedaniya karma should be understood as applying to Sakṣaya jivas, excluding Akṣaya jivas. In other words, the severity of Sakṣaya Vedaniya karma is twelve muhūrta, while that of Akṣaya Vedaniya karma is two muhūrta.

Further, the duration of karmas (anudaya kāla) will be discussed based on the substratum of the Uttarādhāyana. Therefore, the duration of the root karmas should also be understood accordingly. The duration of Vāni, Jñānāvaraṇa, Darśanāvaraṇa, Vedaniya, and Antarāya karma is three thousand years, that of Mohaniya karma is seven thousand years, that of Nāma and Gotra karma is two thousand years, and that of Āyu karma is one antamuhūrta and one-third of a previous koṭi. The remaining time after subtracting the duration from the total time of the state is known as niṣeka kāla (bhogya kāla).

Abadhā kāla refers to the time devoid of the creation of dalikas. When a jiva binds a karma with a certain state, the karma-vargaṇās (components of karma) create themselves to produce the corresponding fruit for that duration. They do not create themselves in the initial stages. This is called abadhā kāla. After abadhā kāla, the creation of karma-dalikas for experiencing the fruit until the end of the state is called niṣeka. The creation is more in the first stage, less in the second, and even less in the third, and so on.

**1** The Uttarādhāyana also mentions the antamuhūrta as evidence. 

Page #159:
---------------------------
## Translation:

122
Ghatak
The rule of Abadhā Kāla is such that in the case of the most severe state of bondage, the Abadhā Kāla of Antamuhurta is twice the time of the most severe state of bondage, and from there, it increases to an innumerable fraction of a Palyopama. The Abadhā Kāla of two Antamuhurtas is twice the time of the previous one, and it continues to increase in this manner until it reaches an innumerable fraction of a Palyopama. In this way, as the bondage increases to an innumerable fraction of a Palyopama, the Abadhā Kāla also increases, and finally, in the bondage of a Koda Koḍi Sagaropama, it becomes a Mau Varsha. This means that for the duration of that time, there is no creation of Dālakas in that many places.

Thus, after explaining the most severe and the most subtle states of the root karmas, we now discuss the most subtle states of the Uttar Prakritis. The most subtle state of bondage of Uttar Prakritis is:

Vigyāvaraṇaprasāye tīsan aṭṭhāra suhrumvigalatige. Paṭhamāgi'i saṁghayanē bas surime su dugavudho. ||28||

**Word Meaning:**

Vigdhāvaraṇasāye - five Antarayas, five Jñānāvaraṇas, nine Darśanāvaraṇas, and Asātāvedaniya karma. Tīsan - thirty Koda Koḍi Sagaropama. Aṭṭhāra - eighteen Koda Koḍi Sagaropama. Sukhamvigalatige - subtle and Vikalātrika. Paramāgi'i saṁghayanē - first Samsthāna and first Samhanana. Bas - ten Koda Koḍi Sagaropama. Kus - both. Urimesu - Uttar Samsthāna and Samhananas. Bugḍḍho - an increase of two Koda Koḍi Sagaropama.

**Meaning of the Verse:**

## The Fifth Section of the Dharma Grantha

**123**

The highest state of the Vikalatraik is eighteen Koḍakoḍī Sagaropama. The first Sansthāna and the first Sanhanana have ten Koḍakoḍī Sagaropama, and for each subsequent Sansthāna and Sanhanana, there is an increase of two Sagaropama. In the Viśeṣārṣa-Gāthā, the highest states of all the Uttaraprakṛtis of Jñānāvaraṇa, Darśanāvaraṇa, and Antarāya karma, and some of the Uttaraprakṛtis of Asāta Vedaniya and Nāmakarma are mentioned.

Regarding the highest states of the Uttaraprakṛtis of karma, it should be understood that their states are not different from the states of the Mūlaprakṛtis. However, the highest state among the Uttaraprakṛtis is considered to be the highest state of the Mūlaprakṛti. Therefore, while mentioning the highest states of the Uttaraprakṛtis, it is said:

"Vigdhāvaraṇasāe Tīs" - The highest state of Jñānāvaraṇa, Darśanāvaraṇa, and Antarāya, which are five, nine, and five respectively, and Asāta Vedaniya, which are twenty in total, is equal to the highest state of the Mūlakarma Prakṛtis, which is thirty Koḍakoḍī Sagaropama. However, the Uttaraprakṛtis of Nāmakarma have more variations in their highest states, hence their highest states are mentioned separately along with their names.

The highest state of the Nāmakarma, which is classified as Sūkṣmatraik, Sūkṣma, Aparyāpta, Sādāraṇa, and Vikalatraik, and the two-sensory, five-sensory, and four-sensory Jāti Nāmakarma, is eighteen Sagara - "Aṭṭhāra Suhambimal Tige". Among the different types of Sansthāna and Sanhanana Nāmakarma, the highest state of the first Sansthāna, which is Samacaturasra Sansthāna, and the first Sanhanana, which is Vanṛṣabhanārāca Sanhanana, is ten Koḍakoḍī Sagaropama.

The Koḍa-koḍi Sagaropama for the first institution is 'Padmāgi-saṁghayanē dasa' (ten Koḍa-koḍi Sagaropama).  For the remaining institutions, from the second to the sixth, and for the first six Sanhananas, the excellent state is higher by two Koḍa-koḍi Sagaropama for each successive institution or Sanhanana. This is called 'Dusuvari-mesu dugavuddhi' (double increase).  Therefore, the excellent state of the second institution and the second Sanhanana is twelve Koḍa-koḍi Sagaropama, the third institution and the third Sanhanana is fourteen Koḍa-koḍi Sagaropama, the fourth is sixteen, the fifth is eighteen, and the sixth is twenty Koḍa-koḍi Sagaropama. This is the excellent state of the Nāmakarma.

The reason for this gradual increase in the excellent state of the institutions and Sanhananas is the difference in the level of Kṣaya. When the emotions of the Jiva are more complex, the state-bond is also stronger. When the emotions are less complex, the state-bond is also weaker. Therefore, the excellent states of the more refined natures are lower, and the excellent states of the less refined natures are higher. This is because their bond is with the Jivas who have more refined results.

**Verse 29:**

**Translation:** Forty Koḍa-koḍi Sagaropama for the Kṣayas, which are soft, smooth, warm, fragrant, white in color, and sweet in taste. Ten Koḍa-koḍi Sagaropama for each of these.  Two thousand Koḍa-koḍi Sagaropama more for those (ten Koḍa-koḍi Sagaropama) which are yellow in color, sour in taste, etc.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

**125** The excellent state of the forty *kṣaya* is forty *koḍakoḍī sāgaropam*. The excellent state of the ten *kṣaya* of soft touch, light touch, smooth touch, warm touch, fragrant smell, white color, and sweet taste is ten *koḍakoḍī sāgaropam*. And in these ten *jamādāḍī hār nagar*, one should understand that the excellent state of many *koḍakoḍī sāgaropam* is yellow color and sour taste, etc.

**Special Note:** In the *gāthā*, the sixteen *kṣaya* of *cāritramohaniya* and the excellent state of some of the *uttaraprakṛti* of *nāmakarma* are explained. It is as follows: 'Forty *kṣaya*' means infinite *anubandhi* anger, pride, deceit, greed, *apratyākyānāvaraṇa* anger, pride, deceit, greed, *pratyākyānāvaraṇa* anger, pride, deceit, greed, *sanjvalana*, anger, pride, deceit, greed - these sixteen *kṣaya* are in the excellent state of forty *koḍakoḍī sāgaropam*.

In the *uttaraprakṛti* of *nāmakarma*, the excellent state of the seven *prakṛti* of soft touch, light touch, smooth touch, warm touch, fragrant smell, white color, and sweet taste is ten *koḍakoḍī sāgaropam*. And in the remaining four colors, the state of each color and each taste is two and a half *koḍakoḍī sāgaropam* more than this ten *koḍakoḍī sāgaropam*. That is, the excellent state of *nāmakarma* of yellow color and sour taste is twelve and a half *koḍakoḍī sāgaropam*. The state of red color and astringent taste is fifteen *koḍakoḍī sāgaropam*. The state of blue color and bitter taste is...

**Pātaka**

There are 17 and a half *koḍākoḍī sāgaropama* for green color, bitter taste, and 20 *kāmakoḍī sāgama* for black color and bitter taste.

Ten *suhavihagay* (auspicious marriage), *ucce suradūg* (high caste), *thira chakk* (stable six), *purisaraihale* (male Veda), *micche sattari* (false seventy), *maṇuhugayitthosaesu* (human, female Veda, and *sātavādaniya*) are 15 *koḍākoḍī sāgaropama*. ||30||

**Word Meaning:**

* Ten - Ten *koḍākoḍī sāgaropama*
* *Suhavihagay* - Auspicious marriage and high caste
* *Surachug* - Divine couple
* *Thirachakk* - Stable six
* *Purisa* - Male Veda
* *Rahahase* - Love and laughter
* *Micche* - Falsehood
* *Attari* - Seventy *koḍākoḍī sāgaropama*
* *Maṇupugayitthīsaesu* - Human, female Veda, and *sātavādaniya*
* *Paras* - Fifteen *koḍākoḍī sāgaropama*

**Meaning of the Verse:**

The excellent state of auspicious marriage, high caste, divine couple, stable six, male Veda, love and laughter is ten *koḍākoḍī sāgaropama*. The excellent state of falsehood, human, female Veda, and *sātavādaniya* is fifteen *koḍākoḍī sāgaropama*.

**Special Meaning:**

The verse specifically mentions the excellent state of ten *koḍākoḍī sāgaropama* and fifteen *koḍākoḍī sāgaropama*.

1. Although color, smell, taste, and touch are considered as four types of color, they are considered in bondage without their distinctions. Therefore, the excellent state of twenty *koḍākoḍī sāgaropama* for the four types of color is mentioned in *karma-prakriti* etc. That is why the state of the sub-categories of the four types of color is not mentioned in *karma-prakriti*, but it is mentioned in *panchasangraha*.

**RE**

Except for Aharak Bandhan and Aharak Sanghatan, the remaining Audarik Bandhan and Sanghatan, etc., are in the same state as their respective bodies. Therefore, their state should also be understood as twenty Kodakodhi Sagaropama.

Thus, out of the one hundred and twenty bindable natures, four natures of Hak, Tirthankar, and Ayu Karma, totaling seven natures, are excluded. The remaining one hundred and thirteen natures have been described as having an excellent state. From the perspective of brevity of the text, a hint has been given in the text about the Abadhkal of these one hundred and thirteen natures. The Abadhkal of a particular karma is equal to the number of Kodakodhi Sagaropama of its excellent state multiplied by one hundred years. For example, the excellent state of the twenty natures of five Antaraya, five Gnanavaran, nine Darshanavaran, and Asata Bedaniya is thirty Kodakodhi Sagaropama. Therefore, their excellent Abadhkal should be understood as thirty hundred, i.e., three thousand years.

The period from the time of binding until the karma arises is called Abadhkal. Karma is compared to intoxicating substances. The more the state of a karma that affects the soul like alcohol, the longer it remains bound to the soul without yielding fruit after binding.

Which is called its *Abadhakal*. In this *Abadhakal*, the karmic consequence matures and after the *Abadhakal* passes, it starts to bear fruit and continues to bear fruit until the bondage of its state is over. Therefore, the *Panthakar* has explained the proportion of *Avadhakal* as follows: For a karma with a certain *Kodakodī Sagaropama* state, one should consider that many hundred years as the *Abadhakal* of that karma.
The essence of this is that in the state of one *Kodakodī Sagaropama*, there is an *Abadhakal* of one hundred years. That is, if a being has bound a karma with the state of one *Kodakodī Sagaropama* today, then it will arise after one hundred years from today and will continue to arise until the *Kodakodī Sagaropama* period is over.
So far, the *utkṛṣṭa* state of the karmic natures has been explained, and the remaining karmic natures whose states are to be explained further, also include *Akāla*. Therefore, there are two divisions of the state - *Karmārūpatāvasthānalakṣaṇā* and *Anubhavyogya*. The duration of time from the moment of binding until the karma remains with the soul is called the *Karmārūpatāvasthānalakṣaṇā* state, and the state without *Abadhakal* is called the *Anubhavyogya* state. The *utkṛṣṭa* state of the karmas explained here is inclusive of the *Karmārūpatāvasthānalakṣaṇā* state, and to know the *Anubhavyogya* state, one should subtract the *Abadhakal* from the first *Karmārūpatāvasthānalakṣaṇā* state, which is as follows:

## Fifth Firm Granth 121

It has been previously indicated that the highest state of each of the five Antarayas, five Jnana Avaranas, and nine Darshan Avaranas karmas is thirty Kodakodi Sagaropama, and the state of one Kodakodi Sagaropama is one hundred years of uninterrupted time. Therefore, their uninterrupted time is 30 x 100 = three hundred years. From this ratio, one should understand the uninterrupted time of other types of karmas according to their highest state.

The uninterrupted time of Sukshmatrik and Vikalnik is eighteen hundred years. The uninterrupted time of Samachaturasra Sansthan and Vajrarishbhanaraach Sanhanan is one thousand years. The uninterrupted time of Nyagrodhaparimandal Sansthan and Rishbhanaraach Sanhanan is twelve hundred years. The uninterrupted time of Swaati Sansthan and Naraach Sanhanan is fourteen hundred years. The uninterrupted time of Kubj Sansthan and Ardhanaraach Sanhanan is sixteen hundred years. The uninterrupted time of Vaman Sansthan and Keelik Sanhanan is eighteen hundred years. The uninterrupted time of Hund Sansthan and Sewart Sanhanan is two thousand years. The uninterrupted time of Anantanubandhi Krodha, etc., sixteen Kapayas is four thousand years. The uninterrupted time of Mridu, Laghu, Snigdha, Ushna Sparsha, Sugandha, Shwetavarna, and Madhura Rasa is one thousand years. The uninterrupted time of Pot Varna and Amla Rasa is twelve hundred and fifty years. The uninterrupted time of Rakta Varna and Kashaya Rasa is fifteen hundred years. The uninterrupted time of Neel Varna and Katuk Rasa is seventeen hundred and fifty years. The uninterrupted time of Krishna Varna and Tikta Rasa is two thousand years. The uninterrupted time of Shubha Vihayogati, Uchcha Gotra, Devadvik, Sthira Shatk, Purusha Ved, Hasya, and Rati is one thousand years. The uninterrupted time of Mithyatva is seven thousand years. The uninterrupted time of Manusyadvik, Strived, Saata Vedaniya is fifteen hundred years. The uninterrupted time of Bhaya, Jugupsa, Arati, Shoka, Vaikriya Dvik, Tiyan Dvik, Odarik Dvik, Narak Dvik, Neecha Gotra, Taijas Panchak, Asthira Pak, Tas Chatushk, Sthavar, Ekendriya, Panchendriya, Napumsak Ved, Ashubha Vihayogati, Uchchwas Chatushk, Guru, Karkasha, Rooksha, Sheet Sparsha, and Durgandha is two thousand years.

**Matak**

_Having explained the excellent state of bondage and the duration of its obstruction in relation to that state for one hundred and thirteen types of karmas, we now proceed to describe the excellent state of bondage and the duration of obstruction for the three types of karmas, namely, name karma, aharakdvik, and tirthankara, as well as the excellent state of bondage for the Uttar types of ayu karma._

**Guv Kosikod'ianso Tistaharana Mitramuh Baha. Lahathi Santhgunaa Narasiriyaanau Pallatigan. ||33||**

**Word Meaning:**

* Guv - Excellent state
* Kodikod'ianso - Within Kodikod'i, like an ocean
* Tistaharana - Tirthankara and Aharakdvik name karma
* Mitramuh - At the end, Muhurta
* Baha - Duration of obstruction
* Lahathi - Many
* Santhgunaa - Without qualities
* Narasiriyaanau - Humans and Tiryanch
* Pallatigan - Three Palya, like three moments

**Meaning of the Verse:**

The excellent state of bondage for Tirthankara and Aharakdvik name karma is within Kodikod'i, like an ocean, and the duration of obstruction is at the end of a Muhurta. The inferior state of bondage is without qualities and within Kodikod'i, like an ocean. The excellent state of bondage for human and Tiryanch ayu karma is three Palya, like three moments.

**Special Meaning:**

This verse explains the excellent and inferior states of bondage and the duration of obstruction for Tirthankara and Aharakdvik, including the aharak body and aharak limbs. It also explains the excellent state of bondage for the two types of ayu karma, human and Tiryanch.

The excellent and inferior states of bondage for Tirthankara and Aharakdvik are described together for the sake of brevity. These three...

## Fifth Karma Granth

The two states of the karmas, the excellent and the inferior, are both like the ocean (Antahkodakodi Sagaropama). However, the difference is that the magnitude of the inferior state compared to the excellent state is numerically insignificant, meaning it is a fraction of the excellent state. Similarly, their excellent and inferior durations (Abadhakal) are also very different, and like the states, the inferior Abadhakal is numerically insignificant compared to the excellent Abadhakal. Thus, one should understand that the states (excellent and inferior) of these three karmas are Antahkodakodi Sagaropama and their Abadhakal is Antamuhurta Pramana.

The excellent state of the Tirthankara and Aharakdvig, which is described as Antahkodakodi Sagaropama, refers to the state of the Nikachit Tirthankara and Aharakdvig. The state of the Nikachit Tirthankara and Aharakdvig is from a fraction of the Antahkodakodi Sagar to the state of the Tirthankara Namakarma, which is slightly less than two previous koti and more than thirty-three Sagars, and for the Aharakdvig, it is an innumerable fraction of the Paly.

When the inferior state of the Tirthankara Namakarma is also described as Antahkodakodi Sagaropama, it raises a question for the inquisitive mind. If the inferior state of the Tirthankara Namakarma is also Antahkodakodi Sagaropama, then:

1.  Some consider slightly less than Kodakodi as Antahkodakodi. This means that the excellent and inferior states of all three karmas are slightly less than Kodakodi Sagaropama.
2.  Antahkodakodi Titthayarahaar Tie Sakhao. Tetis Paliyan Sankhan Nikaiyanan Su Ukkossa - Panchasangrah 5.42
3.  The commentary on Go Karmakand Gapa 157 explains the proof of Antahkodakodi as follows: The Abadha of the state of one Kodakodi Sagar is said to be one hundred years. In this hundred years, there are ten lakh eighty...

Page #171:
---------------------------
A Jiva with the nature of a Tirthankara cannot remain in the state of a Tirthankara without going through the cycle of transmigration (Tiyachgati). This long state cannot be completed without traversing the Tiyachgati. Because the time for the five-sense (Panchendriya) state is said to be slightly more than one thousand Sagaras, and the time for the three-sense (Traskaya) state is said to be slightly more than two thousand Sagaras. Therefore, no Jiva can continuously take birth in the five-sense state for a longer period, nor in the three-sense state. And finally, the Jiva cannot complete the long period of bondage in the state of Koda-kodi Sagaras by taking birth only in the hell, human, and god states. Therefore, it must go through the Tiyachgati.

Another point is that the existence of the Tirthankara Karma in the Jivas of the Tiyachgati is denied. Therefore, where will it complete this long period? And in the third Bhantr before the birth of a Tirthankara, there is a bondage of the Tirthankara nature for one thousand Muhurtas. When this one Muhurta is unbound, how many states will it have? In this way, by dividing the one Koda-kodi into ten lakh eighty thousand Muhurtas, the quotient obtained is 625623624. This is the amount of states in one Muhurta. That is, one Muhurta is equal to this many Sagaras. In the same way, the amount of states in the final Muhurta should be known.

It has been explained that the **Tīrthankara** name-karma is not present in the **Tiryag-gati**. This statement is made in relation to the **Nikaachit** **Tīrthankara** name-karma, meaning the **Tīrthankara** name-karma that is experienced in the **Aghashya** state. However, the existence of the **Tīrthankara** nature, which can undergo **Udvartan** and **Apvartan**, is not denied in the **Tiryag-gati**.

Similarly, the statement about the bondage of the **Tīrthankara** nature in the third **Bhava** before the **Bhad** of the **Tīrthankara** is also made in relation to the **Nikaachit** **Tīrthankara** nature. The **Tīrthankara** nature that is not **Nikaachit**, meaning it can undergo **Udvartan** and **Apvartan**, can be bound even before the three **Bhavas**.

The denial of the existence of the **Tīrthankara** name-karma in the **Tiryag-gati** in the **Siddhant** refers to the **Sunikaachit** **Tīrthankara** name-karma that occurs in the third **Bhava**.

## Translation:

**Pātaka**

The term "Pātaka" is used in relation to the existence of the karmic force (māmakarma), not in relation to its general existence. Therefore, even if the karmic force of a non-liberated Tīrthankara exists, the being's transmigration through the four states of existence is considered a "mis-statement" like a cow being called a servant.

The essence of the above statement is that the state of the Tīrthankara karmic force, which is said to be bound in the third life before the Tīrthankara's life, should be understood as follows: in the third life, the state is made suitable for the three lives through upward and downward transmigration. Although the state of "Koḍakoḍī Sāgaropam" cannot be fully achieved in the three lives, it is reduced through the process of "Apvartaṇakaraṇ". The scriptures state that the binding of the Tīrthankara nature in the third life should be understood for the non-liberated Tīrthankara nature. This means that the non-liberated nature will definitely bear its fruit, but there is no rule for the non-liberated Tīrthankara nature. It can be bound even before the third life.

The excellent states of Narakāyu and Devāyu have been explained earlier. Therefore, here the excellent states of Manushyāyu and Tiryanchāyu are explained as "Naratiriyāṇau Pallatiga" - human and animal life are of three "pallyas".

Regarding the state of Āyukarma, it is important to know that the evidence of the excellent and inferior lifespan is given in relation to the state of existence. This means that any being, upon taking birth, can live for a shorter or longer duration in that life.

## The Fifth Karma Granth
### 137

Now, while explaining the excellent state of Ayukarma, we move on to the uninterrupted time (Abadhakal).

**Verse 34:**

**Iggavigalpuvyakodi paliyasankaas aauchou amnaa. Freekamaana hamasa abaaha sesaana bhavaso ||34||**

**Word Meaning:**

* **Vigal:** One-sense and disabled (Vikaleindriya) beings, their age is a koti (10 million) years.
* **Paliyasankaas:**  An innumerable part of a Palya (a unit of time).
* **Aauchou:** All four Ayus (life spans).
* **Amnaa:**  Those with five senses (Panchendriya) and sufficient (Paryapt).
* **Freekamaana:** Those with uninterrupted (Nirupkram) Ayus.
* **Hamasa:** Six months.
* **Abaaha:** Uninterrupted time (Abadhakal).
* **Sesaana:** The remaining (those with a countable number of years and those with interrupted Ayus).
* **Bhavaso:** One-third of their Bhav (existence).

**Verse Meaning:**

The age of one-sense and disabled beings, as well as those with five senses and sufficient, is an innumerable part of a Palya. Those with uninterrupted Ayus have six months of uninterrupted time, while the remaining beings (those with a countable number of years and those with interrupted Ayus) have one-third of their existence as uninterrupted time.

**Special Meaning:**

The excellent age of humans and animals is generally said to be three Palyas, but the excellent age of some animals and the uninterrupted time of Ayukarma is explained in the verse.

The reason for separately mentioning the excellent age of one-sense, disabled, and those with five senses and sufficient is that the aforementioned excellent state can only be achieved by those with sufficient senses. Therefore, that state should be understood in relation to those with sufficient senses. However, how much of that excellent state is achieved by one-sense, disabled, and those with five senses and sufficient... 

Page #175:
---------------------------
## Shataka

The **bhaura sadha** (dawn) state is being explained here. It is being clarified that the **igadhigalprithvakodi** (earth-based) one-sensed and multi-sensed beings bind the **ekapurva** (one-previous) koti (category) of **ayukarma** (life-span karma) as their highest state. The **asangya** (non-conscious) **paryaptak** (fully developed) beings bind the highest state of all four **ayukarma** (life-span karma) as **palyo** (life-span) **asankhyat** (innumerable) **bhagapraman** (fractional measure) - **palyasankhya** (innumerable life-spans) **auchou** (in the form of) **amana** (measure).

The reason for the binding of the aforementioned highest state of **ayukarma** (life-span karma) for one-sensed and multi-sensed beings is that they, upon death, are born only in the **tiryanch** (animal) or **manushya** (human) realms. They cannot be born as **deva** (gods) or **naraka** (hell beings) after death. And even within the **tiryanch** (animal) and **manushya** (human) realms, they are born only in **karmabhumij** (karma-based) realms, not in **bhogabhumij** (enjoyment-based) realms. This is why they bind the **ekapurva** (one-previous) koti (category) of **ayukarma** (life-span karma) as their highest state.

The **asangya** (non-conscious) **panchendriya** (five-sensed) beings, upon death, can be born in any of the four realms. This allows them to bind any of the four **ayukarma** (life-span karma). However, the rule is that the **karmabhumij** (karma-based) realm for humans is only humans, and for animals, it is only animals. For gods, it is **bhavanavasi** (dwelling in mansions) and **vyantar** (intermediate) gods, and for hell beings, it is only the first three **pathar** (divisions) of hell. Therefore, only a fraction of their **palyo** (life-span) - **asankhyat** (innumerable) **bhagapraman** (fractional measure) - binds **ayukarma** (life-span karma).

**1. The measure of one previous is explained as follows:**

> **Prithvasma u parimanam samari khal hoti sayamahasasai. Ppanam cha sahasaa baudhadhava basakoti nam.**

> - **Sarvarthasiddhi** (Complete Fulfillment) - **Manar Lal** (Manar Lal) - One previous is equal to 56 billion years.

**2. In **Go. Karmakanda** (Karma Section) **Ma. 538 to 543**, it is explained which beings, upon death, are born in which realm...

## The Fifth Karma Granth
### 136

The indication of the unimpeded state of the remaining seven karmas, excluding the Astikarma, has been given earlier, stating that in the state of a Koḍakoḍī ocean, there is an unimpeded period of one hundred years. However, this ratio does not apply to the unimpeded state of Ayukarma. The reason for this is that the binding of other karmas is continuous, but the binding of Ayukarma occurs only at specific times. Therefore, the unimpeded period of Ayukarma has been indicated separately as follows:

**Niruvakamaṇ ṣaṃmāsā - Nirupakrama āyu vāle** - that is, for those Devas, Narakas, and Bhogabhūmi humans and Tiryanchas whose lifespan is not subject to decay or destruction, the unimpeded period of Ayukarma is six months. And for the remaining humans and Tiryanchas, the unimpeded period of Ayukarma is one-third of their lifespan - **Abāha sesāṇa bhavatanso**.

|

According to the Gati, the specific time periods for the binding of Ayukarma are as follows:

In the human and Tiryancha Gatis, when two-thirds of the lifespan has passed, the time for the binding of the Parbhavas' Ayukarma arrives.

The Gatis in which they are born have been explained. Regarding the Tiryanchas, it is written:

**Tejadugaṃ tericche se apuṣyaviyalagāyatahā.
Lilūṇagarivi taha'saṇṇī ghamme ya devaduge || 549 ||**

Those with greater Tejas and Vayu, upon death, are born in the Tiryancha Gati and the human Gati. However, they cannot become Tirthankaras, etc. And the Asanji Panchendriya beings are born in the aforementioned Tiryancha and human Gatis, as well as in the first Naraka called Dharma, and in the Devadrik, that is, the Bhavanavāsī and Vyantar Devas.

**1 Āusa ya āvāhā ṇ ḍipiḍimā**
| —Go. Karmakāṇḍa 158

Just as the measure of unimpededness is determined according to the proportion of the state in other karmas, it is not determined in the Astikarma.

## Shataka

As if a human being has a lifespan of 6 years, then after 66 years have passed, he can bind the lifespan of the next birth. Before that, his lifespan karma cannot be bound. Therefore, the unobstructed period of the bound lifespan karma of humans and animals is said to be one-third of a previous koti, because the lifespan of humans and animals in the karmabhoomi is one previous koti, and the lifespan of the next birth is bound in its division.

This is the arrangement of the unobstructed period of lifespan karma in relation to humans and animals in the karmabhoomi, but humans and animals in the bhogabhoomi, as well as gods and hell beings, bind the lifespan of the next birth when six months remain of their respective lifespans. Because these are those with unchangeable lifespans. They do not die prematurely. Therefore, the unobstructed period of the bound lifespan of those with unchangeable lifespans is said to be six months.

In relation to the unobstructed period of lifespan karma, one more thing should be kept in mind: the unobstructed period is also included in the seven karmas that were mentioned earlier. For example, the highest state of mithyatva mohaniya is said to be seventy koḍakoḍi sagaropama, and its unobstructed period is seven thousand years. So these seven thousand years are included in that seventy koḍakoḍi sagaropama state. Therefore, when you want to know the unobstructed state (anubhavayogya) of mithyatva mohaniya, you should subtract seven thousand years from its unobstructed period. But

1. **Opapatik, naraka, deva, nama-shariri, uttama purusha, and those with countless years of lifespan, these are those with unchangeable lifespans.**

- Tattvartha Sutra 2052

## Fifth Karma-Pratya

This is not the case with Ayukarma. The thirty-three Sagars, three Palyas, and the countless parts of a Palyas, as described in the state of Ayukarma, are pure states. They do not include the Adadhakal. The reason for this difference is that the state of other Karmas is dependent on the proportion of their unobstructed state, which makes it certain. However, the unobstructed state of Ayukarma is not certain. Because even in the division of lifespan, the binding of Ayukarma is not inevitable. Dividing the division again and again, eight divisions arise. Even in those, if there is no binding of lifespan, then death occurs, and the binding of lifespan happens in the very last moment before death. Due to this uncertainty, the Adadhakal is not included in the state of Ayukarma.

The Sangrahani Sutra also clarifies this point regarding the lifespan binding related to the next birth:

"Devas, Narakas, and humans with lifespans of countless years, and Tiryanchas with six months of lifespan remaining, bind the lifespan of the next birth when they have a remaining lifespan that is not subject to division. Those beings with a lifespan subject to division bind the lifespan of the next birth when they have one-third, one-ninth, or one-twenty-seventh of their lifespan remaining. If they are unable to bind lifespan within these three divisions, then they bind it in the final moment before death." 

Page #179:
---------------------------
## 142nd Century

"They bind the lifespan of the next existence."

The **Gol Karmakanda** also generally expresses the same view regarding the binding of lifespan, but it is uncertain about the six-month period of Devas, Narakas, and Bhogbhoomij, whether the lifespan is bound in the six months or in its division. If the lifespan is not bound in the division, then it is bound in the ninth part of the six months. The gist of this is that just as humans and Niyantras in the lower realms bind the lifespan of the next existence in the division of their entire lifespan, similarly, Devas, Narakas, and Bhogbhoomij humans, and Tiryanchas bind the lifespan in the three divisions of their six months. There is disagreement regarding Bhogbhoomij. Some believe that the lifespan of the next existence is bound in the division when nine months of their lifespan remain. 

Besides this, there is another disagreement: if the lifespan is not bound in the eight divisions, then the lifespan of the next existence is bound by rule when a fraction of the experienced lifespan remains. This is generally accepted, but some believe that the lifespan of the next existence is bound by rule when an immeasurable fraction of the experienced lifespan remains, as small as an Aavlika.

The **Gol Karmakanda** from verses 128 to 133 has the same statements about the binding of the excellent state of the next existence as the **Karmagrantha**. However, it is noteworthy that it mentions the state of the four categories (varna, etc.) as "twenty Kodakodi Sagaropama," while the **Karmagrantha** mentions ten Kodakodi Sagaropama to twenty Kodakodi Sagaropama for their sub-categories. The reason for this difference is that the **Karmagrantha** mentions the excellent state of the sub-categories of varna, gandha, rasa, and roop based on the collection of these elements. However, there are only four categories in terms of binding. The author himself has explained this in the **Snopgyan Tika**.

##  The Fivefold Submergence

Thus, having explained the excellent state and unimpeded time of the Uttar Prakritis, we now proceed to explain their inferior state.

**Lahutibandha, Sanjalanloha, Panavigghana, Nagasesu, Bhinnamuhutasu.**

**Te Attha Asunche Baram Saaye.** || 35 ||

**Word Meanings:**

* Lahutibandha - Inferior state bondage
* Sanjalanloha - Mantra-induced greed
* Panavigghana - Five obstacles to liberation
* Nagasesu - Knowledge-obscuring and vision-obscuring karmas
* Bhinnamuhutasu - Internal moments
* Te - Those
* Attha - Eight Muhurtas
* Jamuche - Of animals and high lineage
* Parasa - Twelve Muhurtas
* Saaye - Seven Vedaniyas

**Meaning of the Verse:**

The inferior state bondage of Sanjalanloha, the five obstacles, the five knowledge-obscuring karmas, and the four vision-obscuring karmas is in the internal moments. The inferior state bondage of Yashas Kirti name-karma, high lineage, and the seven Vedaniyas is for eight Muhurtas, and for twelve Muhurtas for the seven Vedaniyas.

**Special Meaning:**

Previously, the excellent state bondage of the karma prakritis was explained. This verse begins the explanation of their inferior state bondage. This verse refers to the inferior state bondage of fifteen Dharmic karmas and three Adharmic karmas. According to their division, their names are as follows:

* **Dharmic:** Five knowledge-obscuring karmas (like Matijnanaavaran), four vision-obscuring karmas (like Chakshudarshanavaran), Sanjalanloha, five obstacles (like Danaantaraaya).
* **Adharmic:** Yashas Kirti name-karma, high lineage, seven Vedaniyas.

Regarding the inferior state bondage, the general rule is that it occurs at the time of their respective bondage-dissociation. In other words, when those prakritis come to an end, then the said inferior state bondage occurs.

## Translation:

**144**

**Shataka**

The heinous state of binding of the Sanjwalan Lobha is in the ninth Gunasthan, and the five Antarayas, five Gnanavarans, and four Darshanavarans are unbound in the final moment of the tenth Gunasthan. Similarly, the Yashakirti Karma and Unlon are also unbound in the final moment of the tenth Gunasthan. Only then should their heinous state of binding be understood. The heinous state of Gnanavaran, Darshanavaran, and Antaray Karma is for the duration of the final moment, and the heinous state of Name and Gotra is for the duration of eight moments. The heinous state of the seven Vedaniyas, which is said to be for twelve moments, should be understood in relation to the Akapyas. Because it has been previously stated that the heinous state of the Akapyas is for two moments in the Upshantamoha and other Gunasthanas. The heinous state of the seven Vedaniyas for twelve moments occurs in the final moment of the tenth Gunasthan.

**Do Igmaso Pakkho Sanjalanatige Ghumattuvarisaani. Sesanun Kosaao Micchattathii Jan Laddham. ||36||**

**Word Meaning:**

* Yogamaso - Two months and one month.
* Pakkho - Paksha (fortnight).
* Sanjalanatige - Sanjwalanadhik's Purushaved.
* Attha - Eight.
* Parimani - Years.
* Sesan - Nourishing Natures.
* Ukkossabi - Their own excellent state.
* Micchattathii - The state of Mithyatva.
* Jan - Which.
* Sai - Nandh.
* Laddham - Obtained.

**Meaning:**

The heinous state of the Sanjwalanadhik is two months, one month, and one fortnight respectively. The heinous state of the Purushaved is eight years, and the heinous state of the remaining Natures is equal to the quotient obtained by dividing their excellent state by the excellent state of Mithyatva Mohaniya. 

Page #182:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma Granth

**Special Note:** This verse indicates the method to know the lowest state of four natures and the lowest state of the remaining natures.

The verse mentions the names of the four natures as follows: Sanjwalan Krodha (burning anger), Sanchalana Mana (moving mind), Sanjwalan Maya (burning delusion), and Purusha Veda (male knowledge). Their lowest state of bondage is respectively two months, one month, fifteen days, and eight years. This lowest state of bondage occurs during their respective periods of bondage and release, and their release occurs in the lower Gunasthan.

To know the lowest state of the remaining natures, the author has given a rule: Divide the highest state of Mithyatva Mohaniya, which is seventy Koḍakoḍi Sagaropa, by the highest state of each of those natures. The quotient obtained is their lowest state. This rule applies to 85 natures. Because the lowest state of Tirthankara and Aharaka-dvik, eighteen natures mentioned in the previous verse, four natures mentioned in this verse, and four Ayus and Kriya-shatka are already mentioned. Therefore, after subtracting 3, 18, 4, 4, 6, and 35 natures from the 120 bondable natures, 85 natures remain. Their lowest state is as follows:

The lowest state of Nidra-panchaka and Asata-vedaniya is one Sagar, the lowest state of Mithyatva is one Sagar, the lowest state of twelve Kashayas including Ananta-anubandhi Krodha is one Sagar, the lowest state of Svi-veda and Manusya-dvik is 24 Sagars (divide the upper and lower numbers by 5), the lowest state of Sukshma-trika and Vikalnika is 2 Sagars (divide the upper and lower numbers by 2), the lowest state of Sthira, Shubha, Subhaga, Susvara, Aadeya, Hasya, Rati, Shubha Vihayoga-gati, Vajra-rishabha-naraacha-sanhanana, Sama-chaturasra-sansthana, Sugandha, Shukla-varna, Madhura-rasa, Mridu, Laghu, Snigdha, and Ushna Sparsha is one Sagar. 

Page #183:
---------------------------
One should understand the lowest state of the remaining auspicious and inauspicious categories, the four categories, the second institution and its collection, the third institution and its collection, the fourth institution and its collection, the fifth institution and its collection, and the remaining natures.

These 85 natures can only be bound in their lowest state by a single-sensed being. In these lowest states, one should know the evidence of the highest state of these natures in comparison to a single-sensed being, when an innumerable part of the palya is increased.

The latter part of the verse - "Memakkosaao" should not be taken as meaning that the attained state is taken, but rather the highest state of the category should be taken. For example, the collection of the natures like Matijnanaavaran etc. is called the Jnanavaran category. The collection of the natures like Chakshudarshanaavaran etc. is called the Darshanavaran category. The collection of the natures like Saata Vedaniya etc. is called the Vedaniya category. The collection of the natures after Darshanamohaniya is called the Darshanamohaniya category. The collection of the natures of Kashaya Mohaniya is called the Kashaya Mohaniya category, and the collection of the natures of Nokashay Mohaniya is called the Nokashay Mohaniya category.

**Chapter 1**

In the state of death, the four categories are taken, their medas are not, and their highest state is like a sea of kodi kodi. It should be understood that the lowest state of all four is 3 seas lower than the general state. The state of the sub-categories of the four categories is explained according to the Panchasangrah.

**Chapter 2**

**Panchasangrah 5.54**

A collection of similar natures is called a category. 

Page #184:
---------------------------
## The Five Categories of Karma

The aggregate of the **Nokaśaya** karmas is called the **Nokaśaya** category, the aggregate of the **Nāmakarma** karmas is called the **Nāmakarma** category, the aggregate of the **Gotrakarma** karmas is called the **Gotrakarma** category, and the aggregate of the **Antarayakarma** karmas is called the **Antarayakarma** category.

The highest state of each of these categories is called the **highest state of the category**. The **highest state of the category** is the **highest state of Mithyatva** multiplied by the **highest state of the category**. The **lowest state of the category** is obtained by subtracting an **innumerable** part of the **highest state of the category** from the **highest state of the category**.

The reason for this is that there is a great difference in the **highest state** of different karmas within the same category. For example, the **highest state** of **Vedaniya karma** is **thirty Koḍakoḍī Sagaropama**, but the **highest state** of **Sātavedaniya karma**, a sub-category of **Vedaniya karma**, is half of that, **fifteen Koḍakoḍī Sagaropama**. According to the **Pañcasamgraha**, to find the **lowest state** of **Sātavedaniya karma**, we should divide its **highest state** of **fifteen Koḍakoḍī Sagaropama** by the **highest state of Mithyatva**. And according to the **Karmapratikrti**, to find the **lowest state** of the **Sātavedaniya karma** category, we should divide its **highest state** of **thirty Koḍakoḍī Sagaropama** by the **highest state of Mithyatva** and then subtract an **innumerable** part of the result.

**1. Baggukkosaṭhiīṇ Mittakosagaṇ Maṁ Lakha.
Sesāṇaṁ Tu Jahannā Pallāsakhijjamāgaṇā.** - **Karmapratikrti 79**

The **lowest state** of each category is obtained by dividing the **highest state of the category** by the **highest state of Mithyatva** and then subtracting an **innumerable** part of the result. 

Page #185:

Thus, according to this, the superior state of the Darshanavaraniya and Vedaniya classes is obtained by dividing the superior state of Mithyatva by thirty Koḍakoḍi Sagaras, and then subtracting an innumerable part of the Paly from the resulting value. This gives the inferior state of Nidrapanchaka and Asata Vedaniya. The superior state of the Darshanamohaniya class is obtained by dividing the superior state of Mithyatva by seventy Koḍakoḍi Sagaras, and then subtracting an innumerable part of the Paly from the resulting one Sagara. This gives the inferior state of Mithyatva. The superior state of the Kshayamohaniya class is obtained by dividing the superior state of Mithyatva by forty Koḍakoḍi Sagaras, and then subtracting an innumerable part of the Paly from the resulting Sagara. This gives the inferior state of the twelve Kshayas, including anger, etc., which are Anantanubandhi. The superior state of the Nokshayamohaniya class is obtained by dividing the superior state of Mithyatva by twenty Koḍakoḍi Sagaras, and then subtracting an innumerable part of the Paly from the resulting Sagara. This gives the inferior state of the eight Nokpayas, excluding the Purusha Veda. The superior state of the Nama and Gova classes is obtained by dividing the superior state of Mithyatva by twenty Koḍakoḍi Sagaras, and then subtracting an innumerable part of the Paly from the resulting value. This gives the inferior state of the remaining fifty-seven natures of Namakarma, excluding Vaikriya Shatka, Aharaka Dvika, Tirthankara, and Yash:Kirti, as well as the inferior state of the Nica Gothra.
Here, in the inferior state of the 85 natures mentioned, the indication of subtracting an innumerable part of the Paly, as per the discussion of Karma-prakriti, is not given in this gatha, but in the next gatha, "Paliyasanakha Sahiṇ Lahubandho" is given. This means that after subtracting an innumerable part of the Paly, the one-indriya Jiva experiences the inferior state of those respective natures. Therefore, according to Karma-prakriti,

## The Fifth Karma Text (PFC)

**Concerning the Inferior State of Karma-Natures**

There is no difference in the application of the above verse in the examination of the inferior state of karma-natures. For it has already been indicated that the inferior state of bondage is experienced by the one-sensed beings.

Except for a few natures, having explained the inferior state of the remaining natures in general, we now explain the superior and inferior states of the natures suitable for one-sensed beings, etc., and the inferior state of the subsequent natures of the lifespan karma.

**Verse 37:**

*This (as explained before) is the superior state of bondage for the one-sensed beings, being an infinitesimal part of the Palyopam. The inferior state of bondage is, in sequence, multiplied by twenty-five thousand.*

**Verse 38:**

*For the विकलेन्द्रिय (two-sensed) and असंज्ञी पंचेन्द्रिय (five-sensed without consciousness), the superior state of bondage is the largest, and the inferior state of bondage is the smallest, being an infinitesimal part of the Palyopam. The lifespan of the gods and humans is a year, and the remaining lifespan is ten thousand years, which is considered small.*

**Explanation of Terms:**

* अयं (ayam): This
* उनकोसो (unkosso): Superior state of bondage
* गिबिसु (gibisu): One-sensed
* पलियासहीण (paliyasheen): Infinitesimal part of the Palyopam
* लघुबंधो (laghubandho): Inferior state of bondage
* कमसो (kamso): In sequence
* पणवीसाए (panveesae): Twenty-five thousand
* संगुणिओ (sangunio): Multiplied by
* विगलिसग्नि (vigalisagni): विकलेन्द्रिय (two-sensed)
* जिडो (jido): Superior state of bondage
* कणिट्ठउ (kanitthau): Inferior state of bondage
* पल्ल संभागो (pall sambhago): Infinitesimal part of the Palyopam
* सुरनरपाच (surnarpach): Lifespan of gods and humans
* समा वर्ष (sama varsh): Year
* इससहस्स (issahass): Ten thousand
* सेसा (sesa): Remaining
* खुट्टम (khuttam): Small

**Understanding the Verses:**

These verses explain the superior and inferior states of bondage for one-sensed beings, which are infinitesimal parts of the Palyopam.

**Note:**

For a detailed explanation of the inferior state of bondage, please refer to the appendix. 

Page #187:
---------------------------
It is required to multiply by twenty-five, fifty, one hundred, and one thousand in sequence. -
The superior state of bondage for the विकलेन्द्रियों and the असंज्ञी पंचेन्द्रिय is उत्कृष्ट स्थिति बन्ध, and the inferior state of bondage is the numerical part of the पल्योपम, which is less. The inferior state of देवाबु and नरकायु is ten thousand years, and the क्षुद्रभव of the शे| आयु is the proof. In the verses of विशेषाध-चूर्व, the superior and inferior states of the उत्तर प्रकृतियों are described as being normal. But in these two verses, the एकेन्द्रिय, द्वीन्द्रिय, नौन्द्रिय, चतुरिन्द्रिय, and असंज्ञी पंचेन्द्रिय are described as having superior and inferior states that are different from the उत्तर प्रकृतियों. Along with this, the inferior state of the four types of आयुकर्म is also described.
In the previous verse, to describe the inferior state of bondage of the remaining 85 प्रकृतियों, the method of dividing the superior state of those प्रकृतियों or the superior state of their वर्ग by the superior state of मिथ्यात्व was used. The same method is used to calculate the superior state of bondage of the उत्तर प्रकृतियों of the एकेन्द्रिय जीव. According to this, the quotient obtained by dividing the previously mentioned superior states of the desired प्रकृतियों by the superior state of मिथ्यात्व is the superior state of bondage of that प्रकृति for the एकेन्द्रिय जीव. For example, the superior state of the twenty प्रकृतियों, which are the five ज्ञानावरण, nine दर्शनावरण, five अंतराय, and अमातावेदनीय, is thirty कोड़ाकोड़ी सागर प्रमाण. When this is divided by the superior state of मिथ्यात्व मोहनीय, which is seventy कोडाकोड़ी सागरोपम, the quotient obtained is सागर प्रमाण, which is the superior state of bondage of the एकेन्द्रिय जीव. According to the view of कर्मप्रकृति, the superior state of their वर्ग is मिथ्यास्त्र मोहनीय...

## The Fifth Karma Granth

The excellent state of the **Pancham Karma Granth** should be understood as equal to the gain obtained by dividing it. For example, the excellent state of the five **Jnana Avaranas**, nine **Darshana Avaranas**, two **Bedaniya**, and five **Antarayas** is **thirty Kodakodi Sagara** as per the **Tees Koḍakoḍī Sāgara** proof. In that, the excellent state of **Mithyatva Mohaniya** is **seventy Kodakodi Sagara** and the gain obtained by giving **Bhaam** to it will be the proof of the excellent state bond of a **one-sense being**. Thus, even though there is a difference in the style of statement of both, the basic intention is the same.

In the same way, by calculating the state of other natures, the **Mithyatva** is one **Sagara**, sixteen **Kshayas** are **Sagara**, nine **Nokshayas** are **Sagara**, **Vakriya Shatk**, **Aharak Dwik**, and **Tirthankara** names are excluded, **one-sense**
1. **One-sense** etc. beings are **Kamia Patak** or... that
c. The excellent state is not mentioned, but the **five-sense** **Asanji** has its **bandh**. Therefore, in comparison to it, the **Vakriya Shatk**'s lower and excellent state is mentioned in **Panchasangrah** as follows:

**"Vashvikki tam sahasatahiyam jam agnino tesi. Paliyasakhansunam thii abahooniani sego."**
— **Panchasangrah 146**

The excellent state of **Vakriya Shatk** is divided by the state of **Mithyatva**. The quotient obtained is multiplied by a thousand. The **Asankhyat** part of the **Palpopama** from the product is the lower state of **Vakriya Shatk**. Here, **Adhakal** is the lower **Nisek** time. The excellent state of **Vakriya Shatk** is **twenty Kodakodi Sagara**. Here, it is important to know that the excellent state of **Narakdik**, **Kriyanik** is **twenty Kodakodi Sagara** and the excellent state of **Devdik** is **ten Kodakodi Sagara**. However, **twenty Kodakodi Sagara** is taken as the proof to mention its lower state. This explanation is given in the **Tika**. 

Page #189:

There are 58 types of karmas called "bandha yogya" (karma that binds) and the excellent state of both the gotras (lineages) is described as "sagar praman" (as vast as an ocean).  _ In this excellent state of binding for the "ekendriya" (one-sensed) being, an innumerable part of "paly" (a unit of measurement) is reduced. However, the "palyasankhasheen lahubandha" (very small binding) will be the proof of the "jghanya sthitibandha" (inferior state of binding) for the "ekendriya" being. This means that from the various types of "sagar" etc. excellent states that have been described, if an innumerable part of "paly" is reduced, then that very nature becomes the inferior state for the "ekendriya" being. _ After explaining the magnitude of the "sthitibandha" (state of binding) in relation to the "ekendriya" being, now we will explain its magnitude for the "vikaleindriya" (two-sensed) and "asangya panchendriya" (five-sensed, non-conscious) beings.

The "sagar" etc. excellent state of binding that has been described for the "ekendriya" being, when multiplied by twenty-five, becomes the "sthitibandha" for the "dwindriya" (two-sensed) being, when multiplied by fifty, becomes the "sthitibandha" for the "triindriya" (three-sensed) being, when multiplied by one hundred, becomes the "sthitibandha" for the "chaturindriya" (four-sensed) being, and when multiplied by one thousand, becomes the "sthitibandha" for the "asangya panchendriya" (five-sensed, non-conscious) being. This means that the "sthitibandha" for the "dwindriya" etc. beings is twenty-five, fifty times etc. more than the "sthitibandha" for the "ekendriya" being. For example, if the excellent state of "mithyatva" (false belief) for the "ekendriya" being is one "sagar", then the excellent state of "mithyatva" for the "dwindriya" being is twenty-five "sagar" bound. The same analogy should be understood for other types of karmas. Similarly, for the "shriindriya" (six-sensed) being, it should be known that if the excellent state of "mithyatva" for the "ekendriya" being is one "sagar", then it is bound fifty times more, meaning fifty "sagar". The same rule should be applied for the "sthitibandha" of other types of karmas. For the "chaturindriya" (four-sensed) being, the excellent state of the "ekendriya" being is multiplied by one hundred. 

Page #190:
---------------------------
## Fifth Form Granth
153

For the five senses (Panchendriya) and the non-sentient (Asanshi), one should multiply by a thousand. The resulting product will be the highest state of that particular nature for those beings.

From the two-sensed (Dwiendriya) to the non-sentient five-sensed (Asanshi Panchendriya), the highest state-bond (Sthitibandh) has been described. By subtracting the numerical part of the 'Paly' from it, their respective lowest state-bond is obtained. In this way, one should understand the measure of the state-bond of beings from the one-sensed (Ekendriya) to the non-sentient five-sensed (Asanshi Panchendriya).

1. Similar to the Karma Granth, the Go. Karmakand also describes the measure of the state-bond of one-sensed (Ekendriya) and other beings. Its statement system is as follows:

"Evam Pagdi Panam Sapam Sahassan Cha Mimvaravandho. Igavigalanam Avaram Pallasanghanasanghan." (144)

The highest state-bond of the one-sensed (Ekendriya) and the four types of deficient-sensed (Vikalendriya) beings (two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, non-sentient five-sensed) are respectively one ocean (Sagar), twenty-five oceans, fifty oceans, one hundred oceans, and one thousand oceans. And their lowest state-bond is one ocean without the innumerable part of the 'Paly' for the one-sensed (Ekendriya), and their respective highest state-bond minus the numerical part of the 'Paly' for the deficient-sensed (Vikalendriya) beings.

"Adi Saptariss Ettipamettam Ki Hodi Tisiyabogam. Hari Sampaate Sesanan Igivigale Ubhayathini." (145)

If a one-sensed (Ekendriya) being with a state of seventy kodi kodi oceans of false-self (Mithyatma) karma binds one ocean, then how much can the remaining karmas with states of sixty kodi kodi oceans and so on bind for the one-sensed (Ekendriya) being? In this way, by applying the rule of proportion (Rasik Vidhi), the highest state of the one-sensed (Ekendriya) being is one ocean. Thus, both states are obtained through the rule of proportion.

## The Lowest State of Existence

The lowest state of existence for the four types of life (Deva-ayu, Nara-ayu, Tiryancha-ayu, and Manusya-ayu) should be understood as follows:

The lowest state of existence for Deva-ayu and Nara-ayu is ten thousand years. For the remaining two types of life, Tiryancha-ayu and Manusya-ayu, the lowest state of existence is **Kshudra-bhava** (a very small amount of time).

The **Anta-muhurt** (the final moment) mentioned in the scriptures for the lowest state of existence of Manusya-ayu and Tiryancha-ayu does not contradict the **Kshudra-bhava** mentioned here. This is because there are many types of **Anta-muhurt**, and here we should consider **Kshudra-bhava** as the **Anta-muhurt**. **Kshudra-bhava** is written after **Anta-muhurt** to indicate its small duration and magnitude. The explanation of **Kshudra-bhava** will be given later.

Having explained the lowest state of existence for the four types of life, we now discuss the differences of opinion regarding the lowest state of existence for **Jighnya-abadaha** (the state of being free from obstacles) and the **Tirthankara** and **Aharaka** (two types of spiritual beings).

**Verse 36:**

**Savaanavi lahubandhe bhinnamuhu avaah aujithhe thi. Ke i . suraausamam jinamantmaur diti bhaharam.**

**Translation:**

The lowest state of existence for all types of life has a **Anta-muhurt** (final moment) that is free from obstacles. The lowest state of existence for the highest state of existence of **Ayu-karma** (life-karma) is also **Anta-muhurt**. Some say that the lowest state of existence for **Deva-ayu** is the same as the **Anta-muhurt** for **Tirthankara** and **Aharaka**.

**Explanation:**

The lowest state of existence for all types of life has a final moment that is free from obstacles. The lowest state of existence for the highest state of existence of life-karma is also the final moment. Some say that the lowest state of existence for Deva-ayu is the same as the final moment for Tirthankara and Aharaka.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

**155**

According to the Acharyas, the **jghanya** (lowest) state of the **Tīrthankara** **nāmakarma** is equivalent to ten thousand years of the **jghanya** state of **devāyu**, and the **antya-muhūrta** (last moment) is the proof for **āhārakadvik**.

The **gāthā** (verse) mentions two things. The first part of the **gāthā** describes the **jghanya** **avādhākāla** (unobstructed time) for all **uttara-prakr̥ti** (higher natures), and the second part explains the difference of opinion regarding the **jghanya** state of **Tīrthankara** and **āhārakadvik**.

The **avādhākāla** in the **jghanya** state is called **jghanya avādhā**, and the **avādhākāla** in the **utkṛṣṭa** (highest) state is called **utkṛṣṭa avādhā**. Therefore, the **gāthā** states that the **avādhākāla** for the **jghanya** state of all **uttara-prakr̥ti** is **antya-muhūrta** proof: "**Savvāṇavi lahubandhe bhinnamūh abāh**." However, this rule applies to the **avādhākāla** of the remaining seven **karmas** excluding **āyukarma**. This is because their **avādhā** state depends on **pratibhāga** (participation). However, there is no definite and decisive state of **pratibhāga** for **āyukarma**. Even in the **utkṛṣṭa** state of **āyukarma**, there can be **jghanya avādhā**, and even in the **jghanya** state, there can be **utkṛṣṭa avādhā**. Therefore, there are four possibilities for the **avādhā** of **āyukarma**:

1. **Utkṛṣṭa avādhā** in the **utkṛṣṭa** state.
2. **Jghanya avādhā** in the **utkṛṣṭa** state.
3. **Utkṛṣṭa avādhā** in the **jghanya** state.
4. **Jghanya avādhā** in the **jghanya** state.

Their explanation is as follows: When a person binds the **āyu** (life span) of thirty-three **sāgara** (oceans) while one-third of their previous **koṭi** (class) of **āyu** remains, then there is **utkṛṣṭa avādhā** in the **utkṛṣṭa** state. And if they bind the **āyu** of thirty-three **sāgara** while the **antya-muhūrta** proof of **āyu** remains, then...

---------------------------
## 156
## Sataka

When there is a **jghanya** (inferior) obstacle in the **utkrista** (superior) state, it means that a person has bound **parbhava** (liberation) in the **jghanya** state while still having one-third of their **purva koti** (previous life) remaining. This can be considered an **antmuhurt** (momentary) evidence. When someone binds **parbhava** in the **antmuhurt** state while still having some **antmuhurt** state remaining, it is considered a **jghanya** obstacle in the **jghanya** state. Therefore, even in the **utkrista** state of **ayukarbha** (life span), there can be a **jghanya** obstacle, and even in the **jghanya** state, there can be an **utkrista** obstacle. A detailed explanation is provided in the appendix.

This is how one should understand the obstacles in the state of **karma**. Now, let's consider the **jghanya** state binding of **tirthankara** (liberated soul) **namakarma** (name karma) and **aaharaka** (food karma) according to different opinions.

**Andhakara** (a Jain scholar) has previously stated that **tirthankara**, **aaharaka**, and these three **prakritis** (substances) are bound in the **jghanya** state, which is like an **antakodi** (end of a kalpa) **sagara** (ocean). However, some **acharyas** (teachers) state that these three are bound in the **jghanya** state:

"**Muranaryaouyaanam rasavasasahas laghu satittvaanam**." The **jghanya** state of **tirthankara** **namakarma** along with **devayau** (divine life) and **narakayau** (hell life) is ten thousand years. This means that the **jghanya** state of **tirthankara** **namakarma** is ten thousand years in duration. And,

"**Saaye baras haragaviggyavarananam kinvrina**." The **jghanya** state of **saata** (seven) **vedaniya** (painful) is twelve **muhurtas** (moments), and **aaharaka**, **antaraya** (obstacle), **gyanavaran** (veil of knowledge), and **darshanavaran** (veil of perception) are slightly less than a **muhurt** in duration.

The text does not provide an explanation by mentioning alternative views. Perhaps due to the lack of such a tradition, a specific explanation could not be provided.

Previously, the inferior state of Tiryanchayu and Manushayau was described as equivalent to Ksudra Bhav. Therefore, we now describe Ksudra Bhav in two verses.

**Igamuhurtaami ||40||**

Sattaras Samahiya Fir Iganupaami Ti Khaddangabha. Sagatis Sayatihattar Paanu Pun Panasattasa Hastapanasay Chhattisa Abaliaanang Dhosay Chappanna Igamuttakhu Bhava. Egkhuddabhave ||41||

**Word Meaning:**

Sattaras - Seventeen Samahiya (slightly more), Kir - 
Hriti in Pravasochchwas (breathing in and out)
Iganupaanu Mi - One, Khubhava - Ksullak Bhav (inferior state)
Sagalisasayatihattar - Thirty-seven hundred
Tihattar, Paanu - Pran (breath), Shwasochchwas (breathing in and out) Igamuttami - One Muhurta (moment)
Pan Sihassa Painsath Hazar, Panasay - Five hundred Chhattisa - 
Khuda - 
Chhattisa Igamuhutta - One Muhurta (moment) in Drav Mavaliaanang - Aavlika, Dhosay - Two hundred, Chappanna - Fifty-six, Emkhudave - One Ksudra Bhav (inferior state)

**Meaning:**

In one breath, there are definitely slightly more than seventeen Ksudra Bhav, and in one Muhurta (moment), there are thirty-seven hundred and seventy-three breaths. And, 
1. In one Muhurta (moment), there are fifty-six thousand breaths, five hundred and thirty-six Aavlika, and two hundred and fifty-six Ksudra Bhav.

**Note:**

Even in the Panchasangrah, the commentary on these verses does not provide a detailed discussion by mentioning alternative views. The ten thousand years of Tirthankara's Namkarma is considered the inferior state bond, which is less than the ten thousand years of life bond in hell for a being who goes there. 

Page #195:
---------------------------
## Chapter 158

**A Muhurta consists of sixty-five thousand five hundred thirty-six Kshudra Bhavas, and a Kshudra Bhava consists of two hundred fifty-six Avalis.**

**Special Note:** The verse explains the nature of Kshudra (small) Bhava. The smallest of all Bhavas is called 'Kshullaka Bhava'. This Bhava belongs to the Nigodaya Jiva. Because the Nigodaya Jiva's state is the least compared to all other Bhavas, and this Bhava occurs only in the Manushya and Tithyachar Paryayas. Therefore, the lowest state of lifespan in Manushya and Tithyachar is considered as evidence of Kshullaka Bhava. The magnitude of Kshullaka Bhava should be understood as follows:

According to Jain time calculation, there is one Avali of Asankhya time. One Ucchvasa-Nissvasa is one Sankhya Avali. The time taken by a healthy, young, carefree man to inhale and exhale once is called one Ucchvasa time or Shvasochchvasa time. Seven Shvasochchvasa times make one Stoka. Seven Stokas make one Lava, and thirty-five and a half Lava make one Nali or Ghatika. Two Ghatikas make one Muhurta.

**Verse 1**

"Time is the ultimate, indivisible, and eternal. It is known as Samaya. Asankhya is the time of one Ucchvasa-Nissvasa. One Ucchvasa-Nissvasa is when a being breathes in and out once. Seven such breaths are called one Stoka. Seven Stokas make one Lava, and thirty-five and a half Lava make one Nali. Two Nalis make one Muhurta."

**Jyotishkarandaka, 6, 10**

**Note:** The term "Samaya" is used to refer to time. 

Page #196:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma Granth
156

Therefore, to know the number of breaths in one Muhurta, multiply 1 Muhurta x 2 Ghatika 4 37 Lav 7 Stoka 47 Ucchvas, which gives us 3773. In one Muhurta, a Nigodaya being is born 65536 times. Dividing 65536 by 3773, we get 17.1 as the quotient. Therefore, one should know that the duration of one Ksullak Bhav is slightly more than seventeen breaths. In other words, the duration of one Ksullak Bhav is slightly more than one-seventeenth of a breath, and in that same time, two hundred and fifty-six Avali occur.

According to modern time calculation, the duration of a Ksullak Bhav can be calculated as follows: one Muhurta has forty-eight minutes.

1. In Digambar literature, one breath is considered to be equal to 18 Ksullak Bhav. This is explained as follows:

"Tinisaaya Chattisa Chaavati Sahasgaani Maranaani. Anto Muhusakale Taavdiya Chav Khudhbhava." - Go. Jeevakand 123

A Layaparyaptak being dies 66336 times in one Ant Muhurta, and it also experiences that many births. Therefore, there are 66336 Ksullak Bhav in one Ant Muhurta. These Bhav are called Ksullak Bhav because there is no other Bhav with a shorter duration. The duration of each of these Bhav is one-eighteenth of a breath. Therefore, according to the Triranik, the duration of 66336 Bhav is 36856 breaths. This number of breaths is the duration of one Ant Muhurta for Layaparyaptak beings from the Earth-bodied to the five-sensed. There are 66336 Ksullak Bhav in one Ant Muhurta, with 80 for the two-sensed, 60 for the three-sensed, 40 for the four-sensed, 24 for the five-sensed, and 66132 for the one-sensed. 

Page #197:
---------------------------
160
This means that one Muhurta is equal to 48 minutes and there are 3773 breaths in one Muhurta. Therefore, dividing 3773 by 48, we get approximately 78 and a half breaths per minute, meaning that the duration of one breath is less than a second. In that time, a Nigoda (a type of microscopic being) takes birth more than seventeen times. From this, the smallness of the Ksullaka Bhav (the realm of microscopic beings) can be easily understood.
The subtlety of Ksullaka Bhav is explained in the Gatha (a type of Jain scripture) as follows: the time of Ksullaka Bhav is one part out of more than seventeen parts of a breath.
Thus, having described the situation-bond of the remaining creations and the inferior situation-bond of all natures, we now proceed to explain the owners of their superior situation-bond.

**Special Meaning Verses** state that among the 120 bondable natures, which nature has which **utkrusht sthitibandh** (highest state of bondage).

Firstly, indicating the **utkrusht sthitibandh** of the **Tirthankara** nature, it is said: "**Aviryasammo Tittham**" - the **Avirat Samyagdristi** (one with unwavering right faith) human is the owner of the **utkrusht sthitibandh** of the **Tirthankara** nature.

Here's the explanation:

The owner of the **utkrusht sthitibandh** of the **Tirthankara** nature is a human. This is because, although the **Tirthankara** nature's bondage occurs from the fourth to the eighth **gunasthan** (spiritual state), the **utkrusht sthiti** (highest state) is bound only by **utkrusht sanklesh** (highest affliction). This **utkrusht sanklesh** belongs to the **Avirat Samyagdristi** human who, before attaining **Samyaktva** (right conduct), binds the **narakayu** (hellish body) in the **mithyatva** (false belief) **gunasthan**. Later, they attain **kshayopashmik Samyaktva** (complete liberation) and bind the **Tirthankara** nature. When the time comes for this human to go to hell, they vomit **Samyaktva** and embrace **mithyatva**. Before this moment of abandoning **Samyaktva** and embracing **mithyatva**, the **Avirat Samyagdristi** human experiences the **utkrusht sthitibandh** of the **Tirthankara** nature.

In **devagati** (heavenly realm) and **narakagati** (hellish realm), the **Tirthankara** nature's bondage occurs, but the **Tirthankara** nature's binder does not deviate from the fourth **gunasthan** towards **mithyatva**. Without this deviation, **utkrusht sanklesh** cannot be the cause of the **utkrusht sthitibandh** of the **Tirthankara** nature. Therefore, the **utkrusht sthitibandh** of the **Tirthankara** nature... 

Page #199:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Chapter**

A human who does not bind the hell-existence before binding the Tirthankara nature is not born in hell after binding the Tirthankara nature. Therefore, the human who is taken into consideration is the one who binds the hell-existence before binding the Tirthankara nature. Some (like Samik, Samati, Jid Rajaṇit etc.) may die in the state of Samyaktva and go to hell, but due to pure results, those beings cannot bind the excellent state of Tirthankara nature. Therefore, in the case of the excellent state-binding of the Tirthankara nature, only the human who is constantly in the state of Samyaiṣṭi towards Mithyatva is taken into consideration.

The essence of the above statement in relation to the excellent state-binding of the Tirthankara nature is that although the binding of the Tirthankara nature can happen from the fourth to the eighth Gunasthanas, the excellent state-binding requires excellent Sanklesha, and the human who binds the Tirthankara nature can have excellent Sanklesha only when he is towards Mithyatva. Such a human is towards Mithyatva only when he has bound the hell-existence before binding the Tirthankara nature. When the bound-hell-existence human who is constantly in the state of Samyagdṛṣṭi is towards Mithyatva, at that very moment, his excellent state-binding of the Tirthankara nature happens. The one who goes to hell with Kṣayika Samyaktva is purer than him, therefore he is not taken into consideration here.

1. And it is said in Takacūrṇī - "The human who is in the state of Tityayaranamas, who is in the state of Upakoṣaṭhi, who is in the state of Araj, who is in the state of Veyagasammaddiṭhi, who is in the state of Puccha, who is in the state of Naragabahānāgo, who is in the state of Naragābhimukho, who is in the state of Micchattā, who is in the state of Paśdhijjihi, who is in the state of Antime ṭhi, who is in the state of Bandhe, who is in the state of Vaṭṭamāṇo, who is in the state of Badhai, who is in the state of Tabandage, who is in the state of Aisakiliṭṭho, who is in the state of Kauṁ... who is in the state of Sammatteṇam, who is in the state of Khāigeṇam, who is in the state of Naragam, who is in the state of Bacchai, who is in the state of So, who is in the state of Tao, who is in the state of Visuddhaparotti, who is in the state of Kā, who is in the state of U, who is in the state of Tammi, who is in the state of Prāṇakośo, who is in the state of Na Habai, who is in the state of Ti." - Pañcasangraha Pra.

After stating that the Tirthankara is the master of the supreme state-bond of the nature, now we speak about the master of the state-bond of Aharakdvig and Devayu. It is said, "Aharadugamaraou ya pamatto" - the master of the supreme state-bond of Aharakdvig and Devayu is the Pramattasanyata Muni. Here, the word Pramattasanyata is ambiguous. In the context of the supreme state-bond of Aharakdvig, which is the Aharak body and Aharak limbs, it means the Pramattasanyata Muni who has deviated from the Aprammatta Gunasthan. Because, for the supreme state-bond of these two natures, it is necessary to have supreme Sanklesha, and the Pramatt Muni, who is bound by them, experiences supreme Sanklesha at the same time when he deviates from the Aprammatta Gunasthan and enters the sixth Gunasthan. Therefore, one should know that he is the one who has the supreme state-bond of these two natures.

For the supreme state-bond of Devayu, the situation is opposite to that of Aharakdvig. For the supreme state-bond of Aharakdvig, there is a need for supreme Sanklesha. This supreme Sanklesha occurs in the Pramatt Muni at the same time when he deviates from the Aprammatta Gunasthan.

1 (a) "Tayar Aharakdvig" Aharak body Aharakanga, Gopa Lakshanan "Pamuttu" - it is clear that the Pramattasanyata is the one who has deviated from the Aprammatta state, and he binds the supreme state. This state is inauspicious, therefore, it is bound by the supreme Sanklesha, and the one who binds it is the Pramattasanyata, who is the one who has deviated from the Aprammatta state and has the supreme Sanklesha.

- Karma Granth Tika

(b) The Aprammattasanyata of Aharakdvig is facing Prammatta.

- Karma Prakriti Yashovijayaji Krit Tika

(c) The Aprammattasanyata of Aharakdvig, who is facing Prammatta, is the one who is involved in all the bonds, and he makes the supreme state-bond.

- Panchasangrah 5/64 Tika

The sixth Shataka (century) falls within the Pramatta Gunasthan (state of mind), but the best situation-bond of Devayau (life-span) is with the Pramatta-Samyata Muni (ascetic) who is facing the Apramatta-Samyata Gunasthan (state of mind). This is because this situation is auspicious. Therefore, its bond is only in the pure state, and this pure state is only with the Apramatta Muni who is in the state of Abhibhu Pramassa-Sampat (supreme state of mind).

The summary of the above statements about the best situation-bond of Aharak-Dwik (two types of food) and Devayau is that the best situation-bond of the Aharak body and Aharak limbs, these two natures, is with the Apramatta-Samyata who is facing the Pramatta Gunasthan. The extremely complex results that are bondable to it occur at that time, and the owner of the best situation-bond of Devayau is also in the Apramatta Gunasthan, but with the special feature that he is ascending the Apramatta-Samyata Gunasthan after starting the Ayubandh (life-span bond) in the Pramatta Gunasthan. That is, the bond of Aharak-Dwik is with the Apramatta-Samyata Muni who is descending from the seventh Gunasthan to the sixth Gunasthan, and the bond of Devayau is with the Muni who is ascending from the sixth Gunasthan to the seventh Gunasthan.

"All this is inauspicious, it is a cause of suffering, it is a cause of bondage." This is what the wise ones say, the gods and the humans.

... Panchasangrah 55 5 2 (a) Aharak body and Aharak limbs, these two natures, the best situation-bond is with the Apramatta Yati (ascetic) who is facing the Pramatta Gunasthan. He is bound by the Apramatta Gunasthan with the ultimate bond. These bonds are extremely complex. And the owner of the best situation-bond of the life-span of the gods is in the Apramatta Gunasthan, it should be known. But the special thing is that he is in the state of Apramatta with the beginning of the Ayubandh in the Pramatta Gunasthan.

## The Fifth Karmagrantha
### 165

When the Devayuga's **utkrista sthitibandha** (highest state of bondage) occurs due to pure emotions, a curious question arises: Why does the **aprammat-samyata gunasthan** (state of non-distracted restraint) indicate this highest state of bondage instead of the **pramat-gunasthan** (state of distracted restraint)? After all, even though a **pramat-samyata muni** (monk in the state of distracted restraint) may be inclined towards **aprammat** (non-distracted) emotions, the emotions of an **aprammat muni** (non-distracted monk) are pure.

The solution lies in understanding that the Devayuga's bondage does not begin in the **aprammat-samyata gunasthan**, but rather in the **pramat-gunasthan**. However, the Devayuga's bondage, which began in the **pramat-gunasthan**, sometimes reaches its completion in the **aprammat-samyata gunasthan**. Therefore, a muni who resides in the **pramat-samyata gunasthan** but is inclined towards the **aprammat-samyata gunasthan** is considered bound by the Devayuga.

This interpretation is further supported by the number of **bandha prakritis** (bondage-creating tendencies) mentioned in the sixth and seventh **gunasthanas** of the Second Karmagrantha. The verses from the Second Karmagrantha that describe the number of **bandha prakritis** in the sixth and seventh **gunasthanas** are as follows:

* **(a)** "Sixty-six are the **pramat** (distracted) **sog** (sorrow), **arah** (arrogance), **apiryug** (attachment to the world), **ajas** (laziness), and **massayam** (greed). Ask the six **sarav** (types of knowledge), **rajpa** (royal power), and **nit** (destruction)." (Verse 7)
* **(b)** "Sixty **adhyamatte** (in the state of distracted restraint) are the **surau-bandha** (bondage of the senses) and **jad** (inertia). Eighteen are the **aahar-gadung** (bondage of food), **annah** (bondage of food), and **bandha** (bondage)." (Verse 5)
* **(c)** "The **Devayuga** is bound by **pramat** (distracted) **aaharath** (food) and **aprammat-virado** (non-distracted enemy). The **manuss** (human) is bound by **tityaram** (attachment to the world) and **aviradasam** (non-distracted enemy)." (Verse 136, Karmakanda)

The **Devayuga**'s **utkrista sthitibandha** is achieved by a **pramat yati** (distracted monk) who is inclined towards **aprammat** (non-distracted) emotions, while the **aahar-kaddvika**'s **utkrista sthitibandha** is achieved by an **aprammat pati** (non-distracted monk) who is inclined towards **pramat** (distracted) emotions.

* **(d)** The **Karma-prakriti sthitibandha-adhikarya** (authority on the bondage of karma-creating tendencies) in verse 102 of the commentary by Upadhyay Yashovijayaji also indicates the same. 

Page #203:
---------------------------
**Pasak**
- The bondage of the remaining 63 Prakṛtis occurs in the Pramatta-Samyata Gunasthan. The bondage of the six Prakṛtis - Shoka, Arati, Asthir-Dvik, Ayasha-Kirti and Asatadaniya - is severed at the end of the sixth Gunasthan. Due to the bondage of Aharak-Dvik, the bondage of 5 Prakṛtis occurs in the Pramatta-Samyata Gunasthan. If a being starts the bondage of Devayu in the sixth Gunasthan and completes it in the same Gunasthan, then the bondage of the six Prakṛtis - Arati, etc. - and the bondage of Devayu, a total of seven Prakṛtis, is considered to be severed, resulting in the bondage of 58 Prakṛtis.

Pramatta Munis who start the bondage of Devayu have two states: 1- They start the bondage of Devayu in the same Gunasthan and complete it in the same Gunasthan, 2- They start the bondage of Devayu in the sixth Gunasthan and complete it in the seventh Gunasthan. This implies that the bondage of Devayu can be completed in the Pramatta state, but it cannot be initiated. Therefore, the owner of the Utkrushta-Sthiti-Bandha of Devayu is not a Pramatta Muni, but a Pramatta-Samyami who is facing the Pramatta state.

Except for Aharak-Dvik, Tirthankara and Devayu, the Utkrushta-Sthiti-Bandha of the remaining 116 Prakṛtis is done by Mithya-Drishti. - Micchattthi 6, Sarvarthasiddhi also mentions that the bondage of Devayu starts in the sixth Gunasthan.

Devabandharambhasya pramado eva hetur, apramādo'pi tatpatyāmantraḥ. 2 Mumbu kammatidīṇam micchattthi du bandhayo bhaṇido. Aharam niththayaram devā vā vimottana.

## Fifth Karma-Pratha

The bondage of the remaining 116 Prakṛtis to Mithyādr̥ṣṭi is due to the fact that the superior state bondage is usually caused by the complex results, and the inferior state bondage is caused by the superior pure results. And among all the bondages, Mithyādr̥ṣṭi has a special complex. But here it is important to know that out of these 116 Prakṛtis, the superior state bondage of Manushyāyu and Tiyanchāyu is caused by purity. Therefore, the bondage of these two is not the complex result Mithyādr̥ṣṭi, but the pure result Mithyādr̥ṣṭi Jīva.

**Question:** The bondage of Manushyāyu is up to the fourth Guṇasthāna, and the bondage of Tiyanchāyu is up to the second Guṇasthāna. Therefore, the superior state bondage of Manushyāyu should be Avirata Samyagdṛṣṭi, and the superior state bondage of Tiyanchāyu should be Sāsādana Samyagdṛṣṭi, because the results of Avirata Samyagdṛṣṭi and Sāsādana Samyagdṛṣṭi are particularly pure compared to Mithyādr̥ṣṭi, and pure results are needed for the superior state bondage of Tiyanchāyu and Manushyāyu.

**Answer:** The results of Avirata Samyagdṛṣṭi are purer than Mithyādr̥ṣṭi, but they cannot cause the superior state bondage of Manushyāyu. Because the superior state of Manushyāyu and Tiyanchāyu is of three Palya-upam. This superior state is of the Bhogabhūmi humans and Tiyanchas. But the Devas and Narakas residing in the fourth Guṇasthāna, even after binding Manushyāyu, are born in the Karmabhūmi, and the human...

If a Tiryancha (animal) has unwavering Samyagdristi (right faith), it binds the Devayau (divine life). This means that the purity of the fourth Gunasthan (stage of spiritual progress) cannot be the cause of binding to the excellent Manushayau (human life).

Now, let's consider the binding of the excellent state of Tiryanchayu (animal life) in the second Sasadan Gunasthan (stage of spiritual progress). The second Sasadan Gunasthan occurs when the soul, after vomiting Samyaktva (right faith), turns towards Mithyatva (false faith). Therefore, compared to Mithyadristi (false faith) which is directed towards the Samyaktva Gun (quality of right faith), Sasadan Samyagdristi (right faith) which is turned away from the Samyaktva Gun, does not have greater purity. This is why the excellent state of Tiryanchayu cannot be bound to Sasadan Samyagdristi.

In this way, after explaining in general terms how the Tirthankara, Aharak, and Devayau bind the excellent state, and how Mithyadristi binds the remaining 116 types of excellent states, the next verse will explain in detail which types of excellent states are bound by Mithyadristi beings in the four gatis (paths of existence).

**Bigal Sukumau Gati Gam, Tirimnu Ya Sur Vijambimirayadu G. Egi Di Bhav Rayav Aisaana Suru Ko ||43||**

**Word Meaning:**

* Bigal Samachapati Gam - Vikalendriya (disabled), Sukhmatrik (subtle), and Ayunik (long-lived) Tiryancha, and Manushya (human)
* Sur Vijambimirayadu G - Devadvik (two divine beings), Vaikriyadvik (two beings of action), and Narakatik (two beings of hell)
* Eviyavara Bhav - Ekendriya (one-sense) Sthavar (stationary) and Atap (heat) Karma
* Aisaana - The Ishana (highest) heaven
* Sur - Dev (divine beings)
* Unko San - Excellent state binding

**Verse Meaning:**

Mithyadristi Tiryancha and Manushya bind the excellent states of Vikalendriya, Sukhmatrik, Ayunik, and Devadvik, Vaikriyadvik, and Narakatik. They also bind the Ishana heaven.

It is.
The Devas up to the 166th level of the Pancham Karmapray bind the excellent state-bond of the Ekaliy jati, power and Aman name.
Specifically, this verse describes the excellent state-bond of fifteen prakritis for the Mithyatdhi, Tiryancha and humans, and the excellent state-bond of three prakritis for the Bhavanvasi, Vyantar, Jyotishk and Saudharma, Ishana heaven Devas.
The names of the fifteen prakritis that are bound by the Tiryancha and humans for the excellent state are as follows: Vikalnik (Dwiindriya, Triindriya, Chaturindriya jati), Sukshmatrik (Sukshma, Sadharan, Apariapt), Ayutrik (Narakayu, Tithanchayu, Manushayagu), Devadhik (Devagati, Devanupurvi), Vaikriyatrik (Van Kriyasharira, Vaikriyaangopang), Narakdvik (Narakgati, Narakanupurvi).
Out of the above fifteen prakritis, except for Tiryachayu and Manushayagu, the remaining thirteen prakritis are not bound from birth in Devagati and Narakgati, and the Manushayagu and Tiryachayu, which are of three palyas, are of the Bhogbhumij, and the Narak, Deva cannot be born in the Bhogbhumij after death. Therefore, the excellent state-bond of these fifteen prakritis is described for humans and Tiryancha.
The Devas up to the Ishana heaven bind the following three prakritis for the excellent state-bond: Ekendriya, Sthavar, Atap namekarma. Because the Devas above the Ishana heaven are not born in the Ekendriya jati. Due to which the binding of the above three prakritis suitable for Ekendriya does not happen to them. If humans and Tiryancha have such complex results, then they bind the prakritis suitable for Narakgati, due to which they bind the excellent state of the three prakritis of Ekendriya jati etc.

## Translation:

170.  There cannot be a *sthitibandha* (state of bondage) for the *bhavanapati*, *vyantar*, *jyotishka*, and *ishan* (types of celestial beings). However, if these celestial beings experience such complex results, they bind the *ekendriya* (one-sensed) natures. This is because the gods do not die and take rebirth in hell.

Therefore, the *vikalatrik* (wavering) and other *kriti* (actions) have been described as *krush* (inferior) for humans and *niyantra* (controlled) for the *ekendriya* and other three natures, while the *utkrusht sthitibandha* (superior state of bondage) for the *ishan* and other celestial beings has been explained. 

Except for these eighteen natures, the *utkrusht sthitibandha* (superior state of bondage) of the remaining 68 natures and the *jghanya sthitibandha* (inferior state of bondage) of all 120 bondable natures will be discussed further.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

**Also, the four Ayus, the Pāpaparajēgidi-Bādar sufficient Ekendriya, and the remaining tendencies.**

**Gāthārtha:** The **Tiryanchdvik**, **Audārikdvik**, **Udyot Nāma**, and **Samvāt Sanhanan** have their **utkṛṣṭa sthitibandha** (highest state of bondage) in **Mithyātva** (false belief) for Devas, Narakas, and the remaining 62 Prakṛtis. The **utkṛṣṭa sthitibandha** for all four gatis is done by **Mithyādṛṣṭi** (false vision) Jivas.

The **jighanya sthitibandha** (lowest state of bondage) of **Āhārakdvik** and **Tīrthankara Nāmakarma** is in the eighth **guṇasthāna** (state of being) called **Apūrvakaraṇa**. The **jighanya sthitibandha** of **Sanchalan Kaṣāya** and **Puruṣaved** is in the ninth **guṇasthāna** called **Anivṛtti Bādar**.

The **jighanya sthitibandha** of **Sāta Vedaniya**, **Yaśaḥkīrti**, **Uchcha Gotra**, **Five Jñānāvaraṇa**, **Four Darśanāvaraṇa**, and **Five Antarāya** is at the end of the **Sūkṣmasampārāya** **guṇasthāna**. The **jighanya sthitibandha** of **Vaikriyaṣaṭka** is done by the **Asanjnī Panchendriya Tiryanch**. The **jighanya sthitibandha** of the four **Ayus** is done by both **Sanjnī** and **Asanjnī**. The **jighanya sthitibandha** of the remaining Prakṛtis is done by the **Bādar Paryāpta Ekendriya** Jiva.

**Special Note:** The first half of **Viśeṣārthāthā 44** describes the **utkṛṣṭa sthitibandha** of the Prakṛtis, while the second half and **Gāthā 15** describe the **jighanya sthitibandha**.

The previous **Gāthā** explained the **utkṛṣṭa sthitibandha** of 18 Prakṛtis. Now, explaining the **utkṛṣṭa sthitibandha** of the remaining 8 Prakṛtis, it is said that the **utkṛṣṭa sthitibandha** of **Tiryanchdvik** (Tiryanch Gati, Tiryanchānupūvī), **Audārikdvik** (Audārik Śarīra, Audārik Angopāng), **Udyot Nāma**, and **Sevā Sanhanan** is done by Devas and Narakas. 

Page #209:
---------------------------
## 172nd Century

The reason for the excellent state-binding of the aforementioned six natures of Devas and Narakas is that when the complex results that are bindable to the aforementioned natures occur, humans and Tiryanchas bind these six natures to a maximum of eighteen Sagara-measure of state. If there are more complex results, then they transgress the binding of these natures and bind the natures that are worthy of Naraka-gati. But Devas and Narakas, even when there are excellent complex results, only bind the natures that are worthy of Tiryancha-gati, they cannot bind the natures that are worthy of Naraka-gati. Because Devas and Narakas are not born in Naraka. Therefore, Devas and Narakas with excellent complex results bind these six natures to an excellent state of twenty Kodakodi Sagara-measure.

In the context of the excellent state-binding of the aforementioned six natures, it should be understood that the Devas of the heavens above Ishan heaven, like Sanatkumar, etc., bind the excellent state of Sewart Sanhanan and Audarik Angopang, but the Devas of Ishan heaven do not. Because the Devas up to Ishan heaven, even when there are complex results worthy of them, bind the middle state of both natures to a maximum of eighteen Sagara-measure, and if they have excellent complex results, they bind the natures worthy of Ekendriya. The Devas of Sanatkumar, etc., even when they have excellent complex results, bind the natures worthy of Panchendriya Tiryancha, but they do not bind the natures worthy of Ekendriya because they are not born in Ekendriya. Therefore, the excellent state of twenty Kodakodi Sagara-measure of these two natures, Sewart Sanhanan and Audarik Angopang, is bound by the Devas of Sanatkumar, etc., who have excellent complex results. 

Page #210:
---------------------------
The five-sense beings (Panchama-farmgranya) can perform the actions that the gods can, but the lower gods cannot. This is because the one-sense beings (Ekaindriya) do not have the capacity for aggregation (Sanhanan) or the combination of parts (Angopaang), making them unsuitable for the two natures.

In essence, even with similar results, there is a difference in the actions due to the distinction in motion (Gati) and other factors. For example, the gods from Ishana to the highest heavens bind the natures suitable for one-sense beings through certain results, while humans and animals bind the natures suitable for hellish realms through similar results.

Thus, out of the 116 natures that can be bound by false vision (Mithyadristi), the remaining 62 natures, excluding the 24 natures from Vikalatrika to Seyat Sanhanan, are bound in their highest state by beings of all four realms with false vision - "Ses Chaugaiya".

The "Go Karmakand" also mentions the owners of the highest state binding of the 116 natures, stating:

"Naratirya Mesau' Vegubbiyachhakaviyalasutssmatiyam. Suranirya Oraliyatiriyadudujjovasampattam. ||137|| Deva Pun Indimaday Thaparan Cha Samanam. Upakassasanka Littha Chaduragadaya Isimjhimaya. ||138||"

Except for the gods, the remaining three lifespans (Ayu), Yakriya Shatka, Vikalatrika, and Mukshmatrika, are bound in their highest state by humans and animals. The highest state binding of Audarikadvika, Tiryanchadvika, Udy, Asampraptamrupa, and Taka (Seyat) Sanhanan is performed by beings with false vision, gods, and hell beings. The highest state binding of Ekaindriya, Atap, and Sthavar is performed by beings with false vision and gods. The highest state binding of the remaining natures is performed by beings with false vision who have attained the highest state of perfection (Sampalesh) and beings with false vision who have attained the middle state of perfection (Madhyam).

##  Century

**Ownership of the Inferior Status-Bond**

Having explained the ownership of the Superior Status-Bond, we now explain the ownership of the Inferior Status-Bond. Before considering the ownership of the Inferior Status-Bond, it is essential to know two things. First, just as Superior Status-Bond requires Superior Affliction, similarly, Inferior Status-Bond requires Superior Purity. Second, the Status-Bond of those Karma-Natures which are bound due to the harmonious presence of the appropriate passions up to a particular Gunasthan, and whose binding is completely severed in the next Gunasthan, so that there is no possibility of binding, is called the Inferior Status-Bond in that Gunasthan.

Therefore, beginning the explanation of the Inferior Status-Bond, we first mention the Inferior Status-Bond of the Tirthankara Name and Aharadvik. It is said that the Inferior Status-Bond of these Natures, namely Aharakatik and Tirthankara Name Karma, occurs in the eighth Gunasthan called A-purvakarana. This is because the beings in this Gunasthan are the most pure in their results. And, the Inferior Status-Bond of the five Natures, namely Sanjwalana Krodha, Mana, Maya, Lobha, and Purusha Veda, occurs up to the ninth Gunasthan called Anivritibadar.

Regarding the ownership of the Inferior Status-Bond of the eight Natures, from Aharadvik to Purusha Veda, it is important to know that both the eighth and ninth Gunasthan should be considered as belonging to the Kshapaka Shreni. This is because there is a special purity in the Kshapaka Shreni compared to the Upshama Shreni.

1. For the names of the Natures whose binding is severed in the eighth, ninth, and tenth Gunasthan, see the second Karmagrantha, verses 6, 10, and 11. 

Page #212:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma Granth

The five types of Jnanavaraniya karma, including the seven Vedaniya, Yash, Kiti, Uchchgotra, and Matijnana Avarana, the four types of Darshanavaraniya karma, including Chakshudarshana Avarana, and the five types of Antaraya karma, including Dana Antaraya, totaling seventeen types, have their lowest state of binding in the tenth Gunasthan, called Sukshmasampraya, which is the destroyer of the subtle coverings. This is because, except for the seven Vedaniya, the remaining sixteen types bind up to this Gunasthan, and therefore, the beings who bind these karmas are particularly pure in this Gunasthan. Although the binding of the seven Vedaniya continues until the thirteenth Gunasthan, their lowest state of binding occurs only up to the tenth Gunasthan, because the cause of binding is Kshaya. The arising of the Sanjwalan Lobha Kshaya occurs up to the tenth Gunasthan, Sukshmasampraya, which is why the lowest state of binding of the seven Vedaniya is also mentioned in the tenth Gunasthan.

The lowest state of binding of the four types of Ayukarma is experienced by both Asangi and Sanghi beings. Among them, the lowest state of binding of Devayuk and Narakayuk is experienced by Panchendriya Tiryanch and Manushya, while the lowest state of binding of Manushyayuk and Tirthchayuk is experienced by Ekendriya beings and others.

In this way, after reducing the 35 types of karma included in Aharakdvik and other Ayuchatusk from the 120 types of karma that can be bound, the remaining 85 types have their lowest state of binding in the Ekendriya beings who are sufficient in the Badaar state. This is because, in the context of explaining the binding of karma, it has been indicated that the lowest state of binding of these types of karma occurs only in the Ekendriya beings who are sufficient in the Badaar state. Among the beings who bind these karmas, those who are sufficient in the Badaar state are particularly pure, and other Ekendriya beings, due to their lack of such purity, do not experience the binding of these karmas. 

Page #213:
---------------------------
The **Shataka** binds more to the higher state. Although **Ekandriya** beings have greater purity in their **Vikasandris**, they inherently bind more to these **Prakritis**, which is why the **Badar** has been declared as the master of the **Jghanya** state binding of the remaining **Prakritis** for the **Ekendriya** beings.

After stating the masters of the **Utkrushta** and **Jghanya** state binding of the **Prakritis**, we now explain the distinctions of the **Utkrushta**, **Anuskrushta**, etc. types of the **Prakritis** in the **Sthitibandha**.

**Ukkosamahatnegarbhangasai Anai Dhusha Adhuva. Chauha Sag Ajhanno Sesatige Aouchasu Duha. ||46||**

**Word Meaning:**

* **Ukkosajhanna** - **Utkrushta** and **Janhya** binding
* **Iyar** - Opposite (**Anuskrushta**, **Anancha** binding)
* **Maga** - Breaking
* **Saisadi, Manai** - **Anadi**
* **Dhuv** - **Dhruva**
* **Madhuva** - **Adhruva**
* **Ghouha** - Four types
* **Mag** - Seven **Mula Prakritis**
* **Ajhanno** - **Ajghanya** binding
* **Ses Sige** - Remaining three
* **Aounjasu** - Four **Ayus**
* **Buha** - Type

**Explanation:**

**Utkrushta**, **Jghanya**, **Anutkrushta**, **Ajghanya** are the four types of binding, or in another way, **Sadi**, **Anadi**, **Dhruva**, **Adhruva** are the four types of binding. The **Ajghanya** binding of the seven **Karmas**:

1. (a) **Sattaraspanchatitthaharanam Suhummbadaraapunvo. Chhadhve Guruvamasanni Ahannnaman Saranni Va.**
- **Go. Karmakanda 151** (b) **Karmaprakriti Bandhanakaran** and **Pantrasangraha Ma. 270** have explained the masters of the **Jghanya** state binding. 

Page #214:
---------------------------
## Fifth Chapter

**177**

There are four types of **karma** (action). The remaining three **bandhas** (bonds) and the four **bandhas** of **ayukarma** (life-span karma) are **sadi** (with beginning) and **adhruva** (non-permanent), thus there are only two types.

**Special Note:** The verse explains the **utkrusht** (excellent), **anutkrusht** (not excellent), **jghanya** (inferior), and **ajghanya** (not inferior) distinctions of **sthitibandha** (state-bond) of the **mul prakritis** (fundamental natures). It also explains the **sadi**, **anadi** (without beginning), etc. distinctions within them as much as possible.

**Utkrusht bandha** is the **bandha** with the highest state, meaning there can be no **bandha** with a higher state than it. **Jghanya bandha** is the **bandha** with the lowest state. All **bandhas** from a slightly less excellent state to the **jghanya** state are called **anutkrusht bandhas**. This means all the remaining **bandhas** before the **amala** (pure) state of the **sasastra sangha** (armed assembly) are called **anutkrusht bandhas**. All **bandhas** from a slightly more inferior state to before the **utkrusht bandha** are called **ajghanya bandhas**. In this way, all the distinctions of state are included in the **utkrusht** and **anutkrusht** distinctions, and all the distinctions of state are also implied in the **jghanya** and **ajghanya** **bandha** distinctions.

These four **bandhas** have **sadi**, **anadi**, **dhruva** (permanent), and **adhruva** distinctions as appropriate. The **bandha** that stops and then starts again is called **sadibandha**, and the **bandha** that has been continuous since the beginning of time is **anadibandha**. This **bandha** does not stop even for a moment. The **bandha** that has never been broken and will never be broken is **dhruvabandha**, and the **bandha** that will be broken in the future is called **adhruvabandha**.

**Jnanaavaran** (knowledge-obscuring), **darshanavaran** (perception-obscuring), **vedaniya** (feeling), **mohaniya** (delusion), **ayu** (life-span), **nama** (name), **gotra** (lineage), and **antaraya** (obstacle) are the eight fundamental natures of **karma**. All four **bandhas** - **utkrusht**, **anutkrusht**, **jghanya**, and **ajghanya** - exist in these. Among these, **ayu**... 

Page #215:
---------------------------
## 178th Century

Except for Karma, the remaining seven Karmas have four types of Ajghanya Bandha: Sadi, Anadi, Dhruva, and Adhruva. This is because the Ajghanya Bandha of Mohaniya Karma occurs at the end of the ninth Gunasthan, called Sampraaya, which is characterized by the non-cessation of Kshapakanaani. The Ajghanya Bandha of the remaining six Karmas occurs at the end of the tenth Gunasthan, called Sukshma Sampraaya, which is characterized by Kshapakshroni. 

These seven Karmas also have Ajghanya Bandha in other Gunasthanas and Upshamni. Therefore, the Ajghanya Bandha does not occur in the eleventh Gunasthan, but rather the Jiva undergoes an Agladesha for seven years before it occurs. This is called Sadi Bandha. The Ajghanya Bandha of the aforementioned seven Karmas that occurs before entering the ninth, tenth, etc. Gunasthanas is called Anadi because it continuously occurs from the beginning of time. The Ajghanya Bandha of an Abhvy is called Dhruva because it does not have an end, while the Ajghanya Bandha of a Bhavya is called Adhruva because it has an end. Thus, there are four types of Ajghanya Bandha for the seven Karmas.

Except for Ajghanya Bandha, the remaining three types of Bandha have two types: Sadi and Adhruva. This is because the Ajghanya Bandha of Mohaniya Karma occurs at the end of the ninth Gunasthan, and the Ajghanya Bandha of the remaining six Karmas occurs at the end of the tenth Gunasthan. This Bandha is called Sadi because it does not occur before these points. It is called Adhruva because it completely disappears in the twelfth and subsequent Gunasthanas. Thus, there are only two options for Ajghanya Bandha: Sadi and Adhruva.

The Utkrushta Bandha occurs for the Sanklishta Pariṇāmi, who has the five senses, the ability to perceive, and the wrong view. This Bandha occurs sometimes, not always, making it Sadi. It is also Adhruva because it is replaced by an Anutkrushta Bandha after a short period of time. 

Page #216:
---------------------------
## Fifth Chapter of the Granth

**176.**  Even in the state of **utkrista bandha** (highest bondage), there are two possibilities: **sadi** (continuous) and **adhruva** (non-continuous).

After **utkrista bandha**, there is **anutkrista bandha** (lowest bondage). Therefore, it is **sadi** because it continues for at least one **antmuhurt** (a very short period of time) and at most for an infinite **utsarpini** (ascending) and **avsarpiini** (descending) time cycle. After this, **anutkrista bandha** stops, making it **adhruva**. This means that **utkrista bandha**, if present, continues for a maximum of **antmuhurt** and **anutkrista bandha** continues for a maximum of an infinite **utsarpini** and **avsarpiini** time cycle. After this, they switch places, making both **sadi** and **adhruva**.

Thus, in the **utkrista**, **anutkrista**, and **jghanya** (lowest) **bandha** of the seven karmas, there are only two possibilities: **sadi** and **adhruva**.

In the **utkrista**, **anutkrista**, **jghanya**, and **ajghanya** (not lowest) **bandha** of **ayukarma** (karma of lifespan), there are four possibilities. However, the only two options are **sadi** and **adhruva**. This is because the **bandha** of **ayukarma** is not continuous like the other seven karmas, but occurs at a fixed time. This makes it **sadi**. Its **bandha** period is also measured in **antmuhurt**. After **antmuhurt**, it stops according to the rule, making it **adhruva**.

Therefore, one should understand the **sadi** and other possibilities in the **utkrista** and other four **bandha** of all eight karmas.

**(a)**  "There are four **bandha** in the **mulapaga** (original state) of the six **ajhan** (non-liberated).
The rest are **sadi** and **adhruva**, and they come in pairs." - **Panchasangrah 5.59**

**(b)** "There are four **bandha** in the **mulapaga** of the seven **ajhan**.
The rest are **sadi** and **adhruva**, and they come in pairs." - **Go. Karmakanda 152** 

Page #217:
---------------------------
$50
Thus, excluding Ayukarma, there are 78 bhangas in total, which are as follows:

There are 10 bhangas each for the remaining seven karmas, namely, Jnanavaran, Darshanavaran, Vedaniya, Mohaniya, Nama, Gotra, and Antaraya.

There are two options for each of the three types of Jnanavaran bandha, namely, Utkrishta, Anutkrishta, and Jaghanya, namely, Sadi and Adhruva. Therefore, there are six bhangas in total for these three. Since there are four options for the Ajaganya bandha, namely, Sadi, Anadi, Dhruva, and Adhruva, there are a total of ten bhangas when these four are combined with the previous six.

Similarly, there are ten bhangas each for the bandha bhedas of Darshanavaran, Vedaniya, Mohaniya, Nama, Gotra, and Antaraya.

There are four types of bandha for Kamukarma, namely, Utkrishta, Anutkrishta, Jaghanya, and Ajaganya. However, each of these four has two options, namely, Sadi and Adhruva. Therefore, there are two bhangas for each, and a total of eight bhangas.

Thus, 10+10+10+10+10+10+10+8 = 78 bhangas are for the eight original karmas, namely, Jnanavaran, etc.

Shatak
After describing the bhangas of Sadi, etc., in the Ajaganya, etc., bandhas of the Mula Karmas, we now describe them in the Uttar Prakritis.

Labheo Ajahto Sanjalanavaran Navagavidhanam. Sesatigi Saiadhuvo Tah Chauha Sespaydiran. ||47||

Shabdarth - Chaubhebo - four types, Ajashro - Ajaganya bandha, Sanjalanavaran Navag Vidhanam - Sanjwalan, Kapaya, No Vavaran, and Antaraya, Sesatimi - the remaining three bandhas, Saiamrusho - Sadi and Adhruva, Tah - from the same, Chauha - four types of bandha, Sespaydiran - the rest of the Prakritis.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

The four Kashayas (anger, pride, deceit, greed) of the Sanjwalan Granth, the nine Avaranas (five Jnana Avaranas, four Darshan Avaranas), and the five Antarayas, all have four types of Ajghanya Bandha. The remaining three Bandhas have two options: Sadi and Adhruva. Similarly, the remaining four Bandhas of the other Prakritis also have two options: Sadi and Adhruva.

**Special Note:** This verse explains the Sadi and Adhruva types of the excellent Adi Bandhas of the Uttar Prakritis. Just as the options for the Ajghanya Bandha of the Mula Prakritis were discussed first, the options for the Ajghanya Bandha of the Uttar Prakritis are being discussed here.

Out of the 120 Prakritis, only those with Ajghanya Bandha are significant. Their names are as follows: Sanjwalan Krodha, Mana, Maya, Lobha, Mati Jnana Avarana, Shruta Jnana Avarana, Avadhi Jnana Avarana, Manaparyaya Jnana Avarana, Kevala Jnana Avarana, Chakshu Darshan Avarana, Achakshu Darshan Avarana, Avadhi Darshan Avarana, Kevala Darshan Avarana, and Dan, Lobha, Bhog, Upayog, Veerya Antaraya. These eighteen Prakritis begin their Ajghanya state with the one who falls from the Upshama Shreni.

These eighteen Prakritis have four options for their Ajghanya Bandha: Sadi, Anadi, Dhruva, and Adhruva. These should be understood in the same way as the Ajghanya Bandha of the Mula Karmas. When these eighteen Prakritis, after having their Bandha-vichched in the Upshama Shreni, fall from there and again create their Ajghanya Bandha, that Bandha is Sadi. Before ascending to the Upshama Shreni, that Bandha is Anadi. In relation to the Abhavy, that same Bandha is Dhruva, and in relation to the Bhavy, it is Adhruva. Therefore, the Ajghanya... 

Page #219:
---------------------------
1=2
There are four types of bonds: Sadi, Adi, Adhruva, and Aghanya.

Of the eighteen types of karmas, all except the Aghanya karma have two options: Sadi and Adhruva. This is because during the time of liberation from the bond in the ninth Gunasthan, the four types of Sanjwalana occur, and the remaining fourteen types of karmas, including the five types of Kanaavaran, experience the Aghanya karma in the tenth Gunasthan, which is the Kshapaka. This karma does not occur before entering these Gunasthanas, hence it is Sadi, and it does not stop completely in the subsequent Gunasthanas, hence it is Adhruva.

Similarly, the Utkrishta and Anutkrishta karmas should also be understood in this way. Because both of these karmas keep changing. The soul sometimes experiences Utkrishta karma and sometimes Anutkrishta karma.

The remaining two hundred types of karmas, including the Utkrishta karma, have two options: Sadi and Adhruva. This is because the twenty-nine types of karmas, including the five types of Nidra, Mithyatva, and the twelve types of Kashya, Bhaya, Jugupsa, Tejas, Karman, Varna Chatushk, Aguru Laghu, Upghāt, and Nirman, experience the Aghanya karma in the Badar Ekendriya Paryaptak, which is pure.

After that, when the same soul becomes Sanklishta Parinaami, it experiences the Aghanya karma. After that, in the same life or in another life, when the same soul becomes Vishuddha Parinaami, it experiences the Aghanya karma again. In this way, because the Aghanya and Aghanya karmas keep changing, both are Sadi and Adhruva.

1. The eighteen types of karmas are considered to be Sadi and Adhruva.

In the same way, the five-sense beings, with their complex and resultant nature, create a superior bond of these twenty-nine natures. After a very short time, they create an inferior bond, and later again a superior bond. Thus, due to their changing nature, these two bonds are also both Sadi and Adhruva. The remaining 73 natures are Adhruvabandhini, and due to their being Anuvabandhini, their four states of bond - Jghanya, Ajghanya, Utkrishta, and Anutkrishta - are all Sadi and Adhruva.

From the eighteen natures starting with Sanjwalan Chatushk, each has four options for its Ajghanya bond - Sadi, Adhruva, etc. And for the remaining three states of bond - Utkrishta bond, etc. - each has ten options for being Sadi and Adhruva, due to the ten options for the nature of restraint. This results in 180 options for the eighteen natures and 102 options for the remaining 102 natures. Each of the 102 natures has four states of bond - Utkrishta, etc. - and each of these four has two options - Sadi and Adhruva. This results in eight options for each of the 102 natures. In total, these options amount to 10,244,840,842,816.

The total options for the Uttar Natures are 10 + 16 = 6. Adding the 78 options for the Mula Natures, the total number of options for the states of bond is 1074.

**Naanant Rayadasan Chakkasanjasan Thii Ajhanna. Chauha Mai Adhrusha Sesa Iyarana Samvaao.**

- Panchasangrah Sha 60. This verse's commentary discusses the options for the states of bond of the Uttar Natures. Similarly, Mo. Karmakand Ma. 153 also mentions these options.

**Manjalan Suhumghos Ghinan Baduvidho Du Ajhanno. Sematiya Pun Duviha Sesanan Ghavi Dhaavi Dudha.**

The Koḍī Sāgar is the measure of the situation-bond, and the one who is described as having an excellent situation-bond of seventy Koḍī Koḍī Sāgaras, etc., is in the Mithyātvā Guṇasthāna only. The reason why the situation-bond from Sāsādana to Apūrvakaraṇa Guṇasthāna is within the Koḍī Koḍī Sāgar measure is that the beings in these Guṇasthānas break the Mithyātvā Granthi, due to which their situation-bond does not exceed the Koḍī Koḍī Sāgar measure.

**Question:** The inquisitive person asks about the statement that in the Karma-Prakṛti, etc., Granthas, those who break the Mithyātvā Granthi are also described as having an excellent situation-bond of seventy Koḍī Koḍī Sāgaras, etc. Therefore, how can it be considered that from Sāsādana to Apūrvakaraṇa Guṇasthāna, beings break the Mithyātvā Granthi and therefore do not have a situation-bond exceeding the Koḍī Koḍī Sāgar measure?

**Answer:** It is true that those who break the Granthi also have an excellent situation-bond, but this excellent situation-bond is only for those who, after suppressing Samyaktva, again come to the Mithyātvā Guṇasthāna. Here, the excellent situation-bond of those who have broken the Granthi and are in the Sāsādana, etc., Guṇasthānas is being denied. In the Āvashyaka, etc., the denial of the excellent bond for the Mithyā-Iṣṭi who has broken the Granthi is indicated by the theoretical view. According to the Karma-Granthika view, even the Mithyā-Iṣṭi has an excellent situation-bond of Mithyātvā, but it does not have strong experience power. Therefore, from Sāsādana,

5. Because of insufficient Samyaktva, even after renunciation, the Granthi is not transcended, and the excellent situation-bond binds according to Karma-Prakṛti, as the saying goes, "The tiger does not speak kindly." This is the theoretical view. The Karma-Granthikas, however, believe that there are excellent situation-bonds from other Granthas.

From the *Sāsādan* to the *Apūrvakaraṇa* *guṇasthāna*, the bondage of a state less than the *Antahkoḍakoḍī Sāgara* does not occur, nor does it occur more than that. In other words, from the second to the eighth *guṇasthāna*, the *Antahkoḍakoḍī Sāgara* is the standard state of bondage, neither less nor more.

**Commentator**
There is a question here: When beings like *Ekaindriya* are in the *Sāsādan* *guṇasthāna*, they have the bondage of a state like *Sāgara* etc. Therefore, the statement that in the *Sāsādan* etc. *guṇasthānas*, there is no bondage of a state less than the *Antahkoḍakoḍī Sāgara*, does not seem appropriate.

**1**
This doubt is not appropriate, because such events are *kādaचित्क*, which are not being discussed here. Here, *Ekaindriya* etc. are not being discussed, but rather the *saṁjñī pañcendriya* (five-sensed beings with consciousness). Therefore, the *saṁjñī pañcendriya* does not experience bondage of a state less than the *Antahkoḍakoḍī Sāgara* from the *Sāsādan* to the *Apūrvakaraṇa*.

It has been stated that from the *Sāsādan* to the *Apūrvakaraṇa* *guṇasthāna*, there is no bondage of a state less than the *Antahkoḍakoḍī Sāgara*. There is a question here: Is there any *mithyādr̥ṣṭi* (false-sighted) being who does not experience bondage of a state less than the *Antahkoḍakoḍī Sāgara*? In response to this, the verse states that both the *bhavya saṁjñī mithyādr̥ṣṭi* (noble conscious false-sighted) and the *abhavya saṁjñī mithyādr̥ṣṭi* (ignoble conscious false-sighted) do not experience bondage of a state less than the *Antahkoḍakoḍī Sāgara*. The qualifier *mithyādr̥ṣṭi* with *bhavya saṁjñī* implies that the *bhavya saṁjñī* also experiences inferior bondage in the *anivṛttibāda* etc. *guṇasthānas*. The qualifier *saṁjñī* implies that the *bhavya asaṁjñī* (noble unconscious) experiences bondage of a state less than the *Antahkoḍakoḍī Sāgara*. As for the *abhavya saṁjñī*,...

The fifth Karma Grantha, Antahkodakodri Sagar, does not have a lower state of bondage, because it is only possible to have a lower bondage after the breaking of the Granthi. However, an Abhavya Sanjee reaches the Granthidesh but is unable to break it and falls back down.  _ From Sasadan to Apurvakaran Grinthasthan, there is birth in the state of bondage. Kodakodri Sagar, as evidence, states that there is no increase or decrease. The inquisitive person asks, if there is no increase or decrease, then how can it be accepted that in the slight difference in the state of bondage, the inferior state of bondage of Deshaviriti is multiplied by the number of the superior state of bondage of Virati, and the inferior state of bondage of Avirat Samyagdristi, which is insufficient, is multiplied by the number of the superior state of bondage? The answer is that just as there are countless divisions of Antamuhurt from nine times to the time-less Muhurt, similarly, there are countless divisions of the state of bondage from the superior state of bondage of a Sadhu to the superior state of bondage of the time-abundant, sufficient, Sanjee Panchendriya, which are the evidence of Antahkodakodri. Therefore, there is no contradiction in accepting the numerical multiplication. _ In this way, having described the state of bondage in the Gunasthanas, we now explain the slight difference in the state of bondage in comparison to the one-sense etc. beings in the following verses.

Jailahbandho Bayer Pajj Asankhgun Sutumapahigo. Esin Apjaan La Suhamearapalpaj Gurru. ||4||

**11.** The state of the eleven indriyas and the apati (non-sentient) is multiplied by the number of their respective qualities and special privileges. Compared to this, the state of the two indriyas, both insufficient and sufficient, is superior in terms of special privileges. Similarly, the state of the one indriya, the four indriyas, and the non-cognizant five indriyas should be understood in the same way (as mentioned for the two indriyas), but with this difference: the sufficient two indriyas and the insufficient non-cognizant five indriyas should be understood as multiplied by the number of their respective qualities.

**12.** Compared to this, the state of the sadhu (saint) is superior in terms of the number of qualities, and compared to this, the state of the deshavirati (one who has renounced the world) is inferior and superior in terms of the number of qualities. The four states of the samyagdristi (rightly seeing) and the four states of the cognizant five indriyas of the mithyaishti (falsely believing) are multiplied by the number of their respective qualities in sequence.

**13.** In these three verses, the relative abundance and scarcity of the state of bondage has been explained, indicating which being has more bondage and which being has less bondage. This difference in the amount of bondage is called the relative abundance and scarcity of the state of bondage.

**Explanation:**

Beginning the explanation of the evidence for this relative abundance and scarcity of the state of bondage, it is said that "jailhubandho" (the sadhu) has the least amount of bondage, and that too in the tenth guna-sthana (stage of spiritual progress) called sukshmasampray. The reason for this is that up to the tenth guna-sthana, there is a harmonious state of subtle kshaya (passions), and it is through kshaya that the state of bondage occurs. No being has a state of bondage lower than the tenth guna-sthana. Although there is a state of bondage for a period of time in the eleventh and subsequent guna-sthana, these guna-sthana are free from kshaya, therefore, the state of bondage is not intended there. Therefore, the state of bondage is least from the tenth guna-sthana onwards.

The statement of multiplicity begins and the *sanjñi* five-sense *paryāpta* false-view is the most excellent *sthitibandha*. From this, the description of slight multiplicity ends there. That is, in the context of explaining the slight multiplicity of *sthitibandha*, the subtle *samprayoga* *guṇasthāna* is one end and the *sanjñi* five-sense *paryāpta* false-view is the other end. The subtle *samprayoga* *guṇasthāna* is the extreme point of the least *sthitibandha* and the *sanjñi* five-sense *paryāpta* false-view is the extreme point of the most excellent *sthitibandha*, and between these two, the statement of slight multiplicity is made.
The order of slight multiplicity from the extreme least *sthitibandha* to the extreme most excellent *sthitibandha* is as follows:
1. The least *sthitibandha* is that of the *sādhuvirati* residing in the subtle *samprayoga* *guṇasthāna*.
2. The least *sthitibandha* of the *bādar* one-sense *paryāpta* is countless times more than that, i.e., than the *sādhu* residing in the subtle *samprayoga* *guṇasthāna*.
3. The least *sthitibandha* of the subtle one-sense *paryāpta* is slightly more than that of the *bādar* one-sense *paryāpta*.
4. The least *sthitibandha* of the *bādar* one-sense *aparyāpta* is slightly more than that of the subtle one-sense *paryāpta*.
5. The least *sthitibandha* of the subtle one-sense *aparyāpta* is slightly more than that of the *bādar* one-sense *aparyāpta*.
6. The most excellent *sthitibandha* of the subtle one-sense *aparyāpta* is slightly more than that.
7. The most excellent *sthitibandha* of the *bādar* one-sense *aparyāpta* is slightly more than that.

## The Fifth Karma Text

**163** The number of these **sthitibandha** (states of bondage) is 36. Although there are 14 types of **jivamaas** (life-spans) and two states for each **jiva** (living being) due to the difference in **jayantar** (birth) and **utkrista** (excellence) in the **loka** (world), which makes 28 states compared to **jivamaas**, but in the description of the **alp bahutva** (fewness) of **sthitibandha**, there are four states of **avirata samyagdristi** (uninterrupted right faith), two states of **deshavirati** (renunciation of the world), one state of **sanyata** (self-control), and one state of **sukshmasampray** (subtle perception), which when added together make a total of 36 states.

In these 36 states, each subsequent state is either **gunita** (multiplied) or **adhik** (more) than the previous state. If these **sthitibandha** are viewed from top to bottom, the **sthiti** (state) increases, and if viewed from bottom to top, the **sthiti** decreases. This makes it easy to understand which **jiva** binds more **sthiti** and which binds less. From **ekendriya** (one-sensed) to **dashaindriya** (ten-sensed), from **dwindriya** (two-sensed) to **saptindriya** (seven-sensed), from **triindriya** (three-sensed) to **chaturindriya** (four-sensed), from **chaturindriya** (four-sensed) to **asanghi panchendriya** (uncontrolled five-sensed), there is more **sthitibandha**, and from **asanghi panchendriya** (uncontrolled five-sensed) to **sanyami** (self-controlled), from **sanyami** (self-controlled) to **deshavirati** (renunciation of the world), from **deshavirati** (renunciation of the world) to **avirata samyagdristi** (uninterrupted right faith), and from **avirata samyagdristi** (uninterrupted right faith) to **sanghi panchendriya mithyaishti** (controlled five-sensed wrong faith), there is more **sthitibandha**. Among them, the **jghanya sthitibandha** (lowest state of bondage) of **paryapta** (sufficient) is more than the **jghanya sthitibandha** (lowest state of bondage) of **aparyapta** (insufficient). Similarly, from **ekendriya** (one-sensed) to...

A quantity obtained by multiplying a quantity is called **gunita** (multiplied), for example, multiplying 4 by 2 gives 8, this 8 is twice its predecessor 4. But if 2 is divided into 4 and the quotient 2 is added to 4, the number will be 6. This will be called **visheshadhik** (slightly more) or **kuchh adhik** (somewhat more). Because this quantity is not **gunadhik** (multiplied more) but **bhagaadhik** (divided more). This is the difference between **gunita** and **visheshadhik**. 

Page #231:
---------------------------
It is clear from the increasing bondage of the state from the one-sense being to the non-cognizant five-sense being and from the non-cognizant five-sense being to the restrained being that with the development of the power of consciousness, the possibility of afflictions also increases. From the one-sense being to the non-cognizant five-sense being, all beings are generally of false vision, devoid of the understanding of benefit and harm, and they do not have the power to use their developed power of consciousness to prevent the consequences of afflictions. Therefore, they experience increasing bondage of the state, but due to being a cognizant five-sense being, the power of the restrained human being develops. Due to being restrained, the bondage of the state of the cognizant five-sense being is much less than that of the false vision, but it is still more than that of the non-cognizant five-sense being.

**Shatak**

1. The **Go. Karmakaad** does not describe the abundance of the bondage of the state, but it does describe the bondage of the state in the sub-categories of the one-sense being and other beings. This gives us a little knowledge of the abundance. The description of the bondage of the state in the sub-categories of the one-sense being and other beings is as follows:

**Vaasoop Baasoo Varattthidiao Subaa'a Soobaap Jahanakaalo.**
**Veevadhi Vijshnakaalo Seshaanamaev Vachaniyamdam.** || 148 ||

**Baap** - **Vaadar** subtle sufficient and **Vaasootr** - **Vaadar** subtle insufficient, both combined, are the eight categories of the karma state of this type of being. **Muba** - subtle **Vaadar** insufficient, **Subaa** - subtle **Vaadar** sufficient, the karma state of these beings is the lowest. In this way, there are eight categories of the karma state of the one-sense being. **Biibiber:** two-sense sufficient and two-sense insufficient, both have the highest karma state, and two-sense insufficient and two-sense sufficient, both have the lowest karma state. In this way, there are four categories of the state of the two-sense being. (Rest on page 115)

## The Fifth Karma Granth

Here, it is important to understand that the **Koda-kodi Sagar** is the proof for all the **Sthitibandhas** mentioned, from the **Utkrishta Sthitibandha** of a **Sanayata** to the **Utkrishta Sthitibandha** of a **Sanjee Panchaindriya Apariapt**. In other words, the **Koda-kodi Sagar** is the proof for all **Sthitibandhas**. The **Utkrishta Sthitibandha** of a **Sanjee Panchaindriya Pariyaapt** should be understood as similar to the **Utkrishta Sthitibandha** mentioned for the general case.

Similarly, one should know the four types of **Sthiti** from **Adim** to **Sanjee Panchaindriya**. These are:

* **Utkrishta Sthiti** of **Badar Pariyaapt**
* **Utkrishta Sthiti** of **Sukshma Pariyaapt**
* **Utkrishta Sthiti** of **Badar Apariapt**
* **Utkrishta Sthiti** of **Sukshma Apariapt**
* **Jghanya Sthiti** of **Sukshma Apariapt**
* **Jghanya Sthiti** of **Badar Apariapt**
* **Jghanya Sthiti** of **Sukshma Pariyaapt**
* **Jghanya Sthiti** of **Badar Pariyaapt**

This is the order of **Ekendriya** types. Similarly, one should understand the **Utkrishta Sthiti** of **Ekendriya Pariyaapt** and **Dwindriya Apariapt**, and the **Jghanya Sthiti** of **Ekendriya Apariapt** and **Dwindriya Pariyaapt**. The same applies to **Triendriya** and so on.

The **Sthiti** mentioned in these sub-types of **Ekendriya**, **Dwindriya**, etc., is progressively decreasing. When this order is followed from bottom to top, it aligns with the teachings of the **Karma Granth**. 

"**Oko-so Sanism Hoi Pajjanagarasev. Sa.**" "**Abhitara-to 3 Koda-kodi E.**" "**Ti Evam Manjasamma Nakosato Adhattam Koda-kodi E Amitara-to Bhavati.**"

...The **Karma-prakriti** describes that all the **Sthitibandhas** from the **Utkrishta Sthitibandha** of a **Sanayata** to the **Utkrishta Sthitibandha** of an **Apariapt Sanjee Panchaindriya** should be within the **Koda-kodi Sagar**.

Now, having explained the relative insignificance of this type of *sthitibandha* to the owners of *jghanya sthitibandha*, we will now explain the auspiciousness and inauspiciousness of the *sthiti* and its cause.

*Sthitibandha* is
auspiciousness
*savvaan vijitthithi asutra jan saikile se nan. mutan naramaratiriya un. || 52 ||*

*vishuddhi dvara, pun-tatha,*
·
—
*sutun   chhodkar naramaratiriya - manushya, dev aur tich ayu ko.*

**Gathaarth:** Except for human, divine, and *tiryanch* lifespans, all other natures are considered inauspicious because they are bound by *utkrisht sthiti* due to the very strong consequences of *mantra*. The binding of *jghanya sthiti* occurs through *vishuddhi*.

**Vishesharth:** In the *gatha*, except for the lifespans of gods, humans, and *tiryanch*, the *utkrisht sthiti* of all other natures is declared inauspicious and the *jghanya sthiti* is declared auspicious. This clarifies the misconception of the common people who consider the *utkrisht sthiti* of auspicious natures to be good because it gives auspicious results for a longer time, and the *utkrisht sthiti* of inauspicious natures to be bad because it gives inauspicious results for a longer time. However, the scholars say that the binding of *utkrisht sthiti* is not good. Because the root cause of *sthitibandha* is *kapay*, and according to the order of *kashay*, *sthitibandha* is also in the same order.

**167**

What is it? Excellent *sthitibandha* arises from excellent *kṣaya*, therefore it is not considered good. Why is excellent *anubhāgabandha* auspicious?

The reason why excellent *sthitibandha* is considered inauspicious is because of excellent *kṣaya*. The inquisitive person asks: "If *anubhāgabandha* also arises from *kṣaya* like *sthitibandha*, then why is it considered auspicious?" This is because of the saying, "The *anubhāga* is *kṣaya*." Therefore, excellent *anubhāgabandha* should also be considered inauspicious like excellent *sthitibandha*, because both have *kṣaya* as their cause. However, the scriptures declare that *anubhāga* of auspicious natures is auspicious, and *anubhāga* of inauspicious natures is inauspicious.

The solution to this is that *kṣaya* is indeed the cause of both *sthitibandha* and *anubhāgabandha*, but there is a significant difference between the two. When *kṣaya* is intense, *anubhāgabandha* is greater in inauspicious natures and less in auspicious natures. When *kṣaya* is mild, *anubhāgabandha* is greater in auspicious natures and less in inauspicious natures. Thus, the intensity of *anubhāgabandha* in each nature is not dependent on the intensity of *kṣaya*. However, the intensity of *anubhāgabandha* in auspicious natures is dependent on the intensity and mildness of *kṣaya*, and the intensity of *anubhāgabandha* in inauspicious natures is dependent on the mildness and intensity of *kṣaya*.

This is not the case with *sthitibandha*. When *kṣaya* is intense, *sthitibandha* is greater in both auspicious and inauspicious natures that are bound. Therefore, the effect of the intensity and mildness of *kṣaya* is the same on all natures compared to *sthitibandha*. However, this is not the case with *anubhāgabandha*. *Kṣaya* has a different effect on auspicious and inauspicious natures in *anubhāgabandha*. 

Page #235:
---------------------------
This can also be said that whenever there is an excellent *anubhagabandh* in auspicious natures, there is a low *sthiitibandh*, and whenever there is a low *anubhagabandh* in them, there is an excellent *sthiitibandh* in them. Because the cause of excellent *anubhagabandh* in auspicious natures is the dullness of *kṣayās* and the cause of low *anubhagabandh* is the intensity of *kṣayās*! But in *sthiitibandh*, the dullness of *kṣayās* is the cause of low *sthiitibandh* and the intensity of *kṣayās* is the cause of excellent *sthiitibandh*. This is the case with auspicious natures. In inauspicious natures, the more the *anubhag* is, the more the *sthiiti* is, and the less the *anubhag* is, the less the *sthiitibandh* is. Because the cause of both is the intensity of *kṣayās*. Therefore, excellent *sthiitibandh* is inauspicious because its cause is the intensity of *kṣayās*, and the excellent *anubhagabandh* of auspicious natures is auspicious because its cause is the dullness of *kṣayās*. Therefore, excellent *anubhagabandh* cannot be considered completely inauspicious like excellent *sthiitibandh*.

Thus, excellent *sanklesha* leads to excellent *sthiitibandh* and purity leads to low *sthiitibandh*, but this rule does not apply to the three natures of *devāyu*, *manuṣyāyu*, and *tiryancayau*. Because the excellent *sthiiti* of these three natures is considered auspicious and its *bandh* is from purity, and the low *sthiiti* is inauspicious because its *bandh* is from *sanklesha*. In summary, except for these natures, the excellent *sthiiti* of the remaining natures is bound by intense *kṣayās* and the low *sthiiti* by dull *kṣayās*. But the excellent *sthiiti* of these three natures is bound by dull *kṣayās* and the low *sthiiti* by intense *kṣayās*. Therefore, these three natures have not been accepted.

## The Fifth Karma Text
**196**

Although the highest state of bondage is caused by intense passions, the manifestation of passions occurs through karma. Therefore, bondage does not occur solely due to passions, but also involves karma. Hence, here we are considering the minimal presence of karma in all beings and its state. The minimal presence of karma:

**53.** Suhamanigoy (subtle nigoda), labhyaparyaptak, aipan... in the first time (of origin), appajog (minimal karma), baire (one-sense), y (and), singalamanamaana (victorious), asaji (five-sense), sanjnee (five-sense), apan (insufficient), lahajghanya yog (inferior karma), padhamku (prayed, badar), mug (excellent karma), pajassiyaro (sufficient), jghanya and utkrisht yog (inferior and excellent karma), asankhguna (innumerable qualities).

**54.** Apjast (insufficient), tas (of), ukkosso (excellent karma), parjajahan (sufficient or inferior karma), par (and other), eva (thus), thithana (state of being), apjeer (in comparison to insufficient), sankhguna (innumerable qualities), parantu (but), apjabie (in insufficient duality), asankhgana (innumerable qualities).

**1.** Asamst (all) - this is a variant reading.

**Pātaka Gāthāyam** - In the subtle Nigodīya Lakshya-paryāpta, the Jīva has a small amount of Yoga in the first moment. In comparison, the Vādar Ekaindriya, Vikalatrik, Asanjnī and Sanjnī Panchendriya Labdhya-paryāptik have an immeasurable amount of Yoga in their first moment, respectively. 

After that, the excellent Yoga of the first two Labdhya-paryāptik, namely the Mūkshma and Vādar Ekaindriya, is immeasurable. From that, the inferior and excellent Yoga of both Paryāptik is immeasurable in sequence.

In comparison, the excellent Yoga of the Aparyāpta As, the inferior and excellent Yoga of the Paryāpta Tras, is immeasurable in sequence. Similarly, the Sthiti-sthāna of the Aparyāpta and Paryāpta are also immeasurable, but the Sthiti-sthāna of the Aparyāpta Dwīndriya is immeasurable.

**Special Note:** In these two Gāthās, the statement of the small and large amount of Yoga has been made. The meaning of Yoga is the special power of the Sakarma Jīva, which is the cause of the acceptance of Karmas. Through Yoga, Karma-raja is brought to the Ātmā. The definition of Yoga in Karma-prakriti (Bandhanakaraṇa) is as follows:

**"Parināma lambaṇa gahaṇa sāhaṇaṁ seṇa lavanama sigam."**

Meaning: The transformation of Pudgalas, the support and the means of acceptance, i.e., the cause, is called Yoga. The Ātmā has Vīrya-shakti and...

**1 Go. Jīvakāṇḍa Gā. 215** describes the nature of Yoga as follows:

**"Puggalavināidehodayeṇa maṇamaṇakāyajutta-sma. Jīvarama jā hu mani kammaāgamākāraṇaṁ jogī."**

The Jīva, who is united with mind, speech, and body due to the rise of the Pudgala Vipāki Śarīra Nāmakarma, the movement that is the cause of the acceptance of Karmas, is called Yoga.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

In a worldly being, the power known as **Yoga** manifests due to the destruction or cessation of the **Dhirāntarāya Karma**. Through this power, the being first acquires **Pudgalas** suitable for **Audārika** and other bodies. After acquiring them, it transforms them into **Audārika** and other bodies, or acquires **Pudgalas** suitable for the mind and transforms them into forms like **breath**. It then relies on these transformed **Pudgalas** for support. This process continues constantly.

There are three causes for acquiring **Pudgalas**: **mind**, **speech**, and **body**. Therefore, **Yoga** also has three names: **Manoyoga**, **Vachanayoga**, and **Kāyayoga**. The **Yoga** activity that occurs due to the reliance on the mind is called **Manoyoga**, the **Yoga** activity that occurs due to the reliance on speech is called **Vachanayoga**, and the **Yoga** activity that occurs due to the reliance on breath and other bodily functions is called **Kāyayoga**.

In essence, the being uses the power called **Yoga** to create the mind, speech, and body, and these become reliant on its **Yoga** power. Thus, **Yoga** is the means for acquiring **Pudgalas**, transforming the acquired **Pudgalas** into bodily forms, and relying on them.

**Yoga**, **Vīrya**, **Sthāma**, **Utsāha**, **Parākrama**, **Cheṣṭā**, **Shakti**, **Māmarthya** are other names for **Yoga**.

1. **Kāyavāṅmana:** **Karmayoga**.
2. For a detailed explanation of **Yoga** and its different types, refer to the **Fourth Karma Granth** on **Yogamārgaṇā**.
3. **Joga ve vigyiṁ grāmōṁ kā pākamo taha bitṭā. Mani samattham diya jogaram havanti pajāyā.** (From **Panchasangraha 366**) - This means, "The **Yoga** power is the cause of the creation of the world, and it is the power of the mind that makes the **Yoga** power manifest."

## 2.2 Century

This **yoga** is present in all beings, from **ekendriya** to **panchendriya**, in accordance with their nature. It has two states: **jghanya** and **utkrista**.  

The question is: which being has the least **yogashakti** and which being has the most **tama yogashakti**? These two verses explain this.

1. The most **jghanya yoga** is experienced by the **sukshma nigodaya labdhyaparyaptak** being in its first **samaya** - **muhum nigodayaikhan**.  After this, the **yogashakti** of other beings gradually increases.

2. The **yoga** experienced by the **badar nigodaya ekendriya labdhyaparyaptak** being in its first **samaya** is **asankhya** times greater than that of the **sukshma nigodaya labdhyaparyaptak** being.

3. The **jghanya yoga** of the **dwindriya labdhyaparyaptak** being is **asankhya** times greater than that of the **badar nigodaya ekendriya labdhyaparyaptak** being.

4. The **jghanya yoga** of the **triendriya labdhyaparyaptak** being is **asankhya** times greater than that of the **dwindriya labdhyaparyaptak** being.

5. The **jghanya yoga** of the **chaturindriya labdhyaparyaptak** being is **asankhya** times greater than that of the **triendriya labdhyaparyaptak** being.

6. The **jghanya yoga** of the **asangya panchendriya labdhyaparyaptak** being is **asankhya** times greater than that of the **chaturindriya labdhyaparyaptak** being.

7. The **jghanya yoga** of the **sangya panchendriya labdhyaparyaptak** being is **asankhya** times greater than that of the **asangya panchendriya labdhyaparyaptak** being.

8. The **utkrista yoga** of the **sukshma nigodaya labdhyaparyaptak** being is **asankhya** times greater than that of the **sangya panchendriya labdhyaparyaptak** being.

9. The **utkrista yoga** of the **badar ekendriya labdhyaparyaptak** being is **asankhya** times greater than that of the **sukshma nigodaya labdhyaparyaptak** being.

10. The **jghanya yoga** of the **sukshma nigodaya paryaptak** being is **asankhya** times greater than that of the **badar ekendriya labdhyaparyaptak** being.

11. The **jghanya yoga** of the **badar ekendriya paryaptak** being is **asankhya** times greater than that of the **sukshma nigodaya paryaptak** being.

12. The **utkrista yoga** of the **sukshma nigodaya paryaptak** being is **asankhya** times greater than that of the **badar ekendriya paryaptak** being.

13. The **utkrista yoga** of the **badar ekendriya paryaptak** being is **asankhya** times greater than that of the **sukshma nigodaya paryaptak** being.

14. The **utkrista yoga** of the **dwindriya labdhyaparyaptak** being is **asankhya** times greater than that of the **badar ekendriya paryaptak** being.

15. The **utkrista yoga** of the **triendriya labdhyaparyaptak** being is **asankhya** times greater than that of the **dwindriya labdhyaparyaptak** being.

From that, the excellent yoga of the four-sense sufficient is countless times. 27. From that, the excellent yoga of the non-conscious five-sense sufficient is countless times. 28. From that, the excellent yoga of the conscious five-sense sufficient is countless times.

In this way, there are 28 places of yoga in the fourteen Jidhasamasas, with the distinction of inferior and excellent. Some other places in the conscious five-sense sufficient are mentioned in other granths. They are as follows:

29. From the excellent yoga of the conscious five-sense sufficient, the excellent yoga of the Anuttaravasi Devas is countless times. 30. From that, the excellent yoga of the Aveyakavasi Devas is countless times. 31. From that, the excellent yoga of the Bhogbhumij, Tiyach, and humans is countless times. 32. From that, the excellent yoga of those with Aharak bodies is countless times.

## 33. The superior yoga of the remaining gods, hell beings, animals, and humans is innumerably multiplied progressively.
Thus, one should know the insignificance of the yoga of all beings. The measure of the multiplier is the innumerably small part of a palya, i.e., multiplying the innumerably small part of a palya in the first yoga-sthana, the measure of the next yoga-sthana is obtained. This means that as the power of the being develops progressively, so does the yoga-sthana increase. With inferior yoga, the being binds to an inferior pradesha-bandha, and with superior yoga, it binds to a superior pradesha-bandha.
Thus, after stating the insignificance of the yoga-sthana, now stating the sthiti-sthana - the number of sthiti-sthana from insufficient to sufficient is innumerably multiplied, but
in karma-prakriti (bondage-making), the superior yoga of the amanya panchendriya paripta is innumerably multiplied by the superior yoga of the anuttara-vami gods...
## Amnana-uttara-gevin bhoga-bhumigayat-iyatanu-gesu. Phmaso asank-gunio sesemu ma jog ukkoso. || 16 ||
When, after stating the superior yoga of the amanya panchendriya paripta, we state the superior yoga of the anuttara-vami gods etc., the 28th sthana will be 27 times greater, and in total, there will be 32 sthana. It is the same in karma-prakriti. The insignificance of the yoga of all beings is stated in Bhagavati 25.1. In it, the superior yoga of the insufficient is said to be greater than the inferior yoga of the paripta.
There is also a back and forth. The reason for this is multi-faceted. In Go. Karmakanda Na. 218, a detailed description of the 242 yoga-sthana is given. For its use, see the appendix.

## The Fifth Karma Granth
### 205

The 'Apjavie Asankhgana' (infinite number of groups) of the Dwindriya Apariapt (two-sense deficient) have a unique characteristic. Their 'Sthiti Sthan' (positions) are infinite in number. This is explained below.

The different positions that a Karma Prakriti (nature of karma) occupies, starting from the lowest position (Janaya Sthiti) and progressing through each stage to the highest position (Utkrushta Sthiti), are called 'Sthiti Sthan'. For example, if the lowest position of a Karma Prakriti is 1 time and the highest position is 18 times, then there are nine positions from 10 to 18, which are called 'Sthiti Sthan'. These 'Sthiti Sthan' are also in increasing numerical order, but the 'Sthiti Sthan' of the Dwindriya Apariapt are infinite in number. Their order is as follows:

1. The 'Sthiti Sthan' of the Sukshma Ekendriya Labdhya Paryapt (subtle one-sense capable) are the fewest.
2. After that, the 'Sthiti Sthan' of the Ekendriya Apariapt (one-sense deficient) are in numerical order.
3. After that, the 'Sthiti Sthan' of the Sukshma Ekendriya Paryapt (subtle one-sense capable) are in numerical order.
4. After that, the 'Sthiti Sthan' of the Badar Ekendriya Paryast (gross one-sense capable) are in numerical order.
5. After that, the 'Sthiti Sthan' of the Dwindriya Apariapt (two-sense deficient) are infinite in number.
6. After that, the 'Sthiti Sthan' of the Dwindriya Paryapt (two-sense capable) are in numerical order.
7. After that, the 'Sthiti Sthan' of the Triindriya Apariapt (three-sense deficient) are in numerical order.
8. After that, the 'Sthiti Sthan' of the Triindriya Paryapt (three-sense capable) are in numerical order.
9. After that, the 'Sthiti Sthan' of the Chaturindriya Apariapt (four-sense deficient) are in numerical order.
10. After that, the 'Sthiti Sthan' of the Chaturindriya Paryapt (four-sense capable) are in numerical order.
11. After that, the 'Sthiti Sthan' of the Asanji Panchendriya Apariapt (uncontrolled five-sense deficient) are in numerical order.
12. After that, the 'Sthiti Sthan' of the Amantri Panchendriya Paryapt (controlled five-sense capable) are in numerical order.

**Therefore, starting from the Janaya Sthiti (lowest position) and increasing by one time, the positions that reach the Utkrushta Sthiti (highest position) are called 'Sthiti Sthan'.**

13. The number of qualities in the state-places of the limited five-sense beings is countless. 14. The number of qualities in the state-places of the perfect five-sense beings is countless.

Thus, with the increase in the measure of the state, the number of state-places also increases.

In the context of yoga, after describing the state-places due to the fewness of yogas, we now state the increase in the number of yogas with respect to time for the imperfect beings.

**Verse 55**
**Word Meaning:**
* Paikhanam - Every moment
* Asankhapuna viriya - With countless qualities of strength
* Apja - Imperfect beings
* Paithii - In every state-bond
* Asankhalogasama - Equal to the measure of countless loka-akasha regions
* Amvasaya - Here, the determination
* Ahiya - More
* Sattasu - In the seven karmas
* Aajasu - In the ayu karma
* Asankaguna - Countless qualities

**Verse Meaning:**
Imperfect beings have countless qualities of strength every moment and have determination equal to the measure of countless loka-akasha regions in every state-bond. In the seven karmas, the determination of the state-bond is especially more, and in the ayu karma, there are countless qualities.

**Special Meaning:**
In the previous verse, the measure of the state-places was explained. Now, here we explain that there is an increase in the number of yogas of imperfect beings by countless qualities every moment, but this does not happen in perfect beings. This increase in countless qualities should be understood until the highest state.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

**All-pervading, non-perishable, and infinite in number, the study of the bondage of karma is a great endeavor.**  Each individual state of bondage gives rise to countless states of study.

**207**

The states of study are called "Aadhyavasaya Sthana" (states of study) due to the bondage of karma.  The intensity of the passions (kṣayās) - intense, more intense, most intense, mild, milder, mildest - gives rise to numerous variations in the states of study.  A single state of bondage does not lead to a single state of study, but rather to many.  In other words, a single state binds different beings to different states of study.  For example, some individuals may have bound themselves to a lifespan equivalent to two oceans, but it is not necessary that they all have the same exact results.  Therefore, the states of study are said to be countless, as vast as the universe, due to the individual states of bondage.

Except for the karma of lifespan (āyu karma), the states of study for the other seven karmas - knowledge obscuration (jñānāvaraṇa), perception obscuration (darśanāvaraṇa), painful (vedanīya), delusion (mohaniya), name (nāma), lineage (gotra), and hindrance (antarāya) - are particularly numerous.  For example, the state of study for the lowest state of knowledge obscuration is the least, the state of study for the second state is greater, and the state of study for the third state is even greater.  This should be understood similarly for the fourth, fifth, and so on, up to the highest state of bondage.  However, the general number for all of these is still countless, as vast as the universe.  Similarly, for perception obscuration, painful, delusion, name, lineage, and hindrance karmas, the number of states of study increases from the second state to their respective highest states of bondage.

However, the states of study for the karma of lifespan are infinitely numerous in a progressive manner.  In other words, the states of study for the lowest state of bondage of all four lifespan karmas are countless, as vast as the universe, and the states of study for the second state of bondage are infinitely more numerous than that, and so on.

Due to the third type of *sthitibandha*, the number of *adhyavasyasthanas* is countless. Thus, it should be understood that the number of *adhyavasyasthanas* up to the *utkrista mitibandha* is countless.

In this way, by explaining the *adhyavasyasthanas* of all karmas in relation to *sthitibandha*, we now explain the names of those *prakritis* and their *abandhakala* (time of non-binding), which are not bound by the five-sense beings for the maximum amount of time.

The **Sagaropama** is the **utkrista avandhakala** (highest state of non-attachment). A human being with **sthavar chatushk**, **ekendriya jati**, **vikaleindriya**, and **athap** **namakarma**, along with **bhav** (existence), should know that the **utkrista avandhakala** is **145 Sagaropama** more than **four Palyopama**.

Firstly, except for **sanhanan**, **sansthan**, and **vihayogati**, the remaining **five sanhanan**, **five sansthan**, **vihayogati**, **anantaanubandhi kshaya**, **mithyatva mohaniya**, **durbhagtrik**, **neech gotra**, **napuंसक ved**, and **stri ved** have a state of non-attachment of **132 Sagaropama** along with **bhav** (existence). One should know the state of non-attachment of these **prakritis** in **panchendriya** (five senses).

**Special Note:** In these two **gamas** (verses), the names of those **uttar kritis** (actions) are mentioned whose **utkrista avandhakala** is in **panchendriya**. The total number of these **prakritis** is **41**, which are capable of binding in the first and second **gunasthan** (stages of spiritual progress). Sixteen **prakritis** are capable of binding in the first **gunasthan**, and twenty-five in the second. In summary, the binding of these **41 prakritis** occurs only in those beings who are in the first or second **gunasthan**. Those beings who move beyond these **gunasthan** do not experience the binding of these **41 prakritis** until they return to those **gunasthan**. Only **panchendriya** beings progress beyond the second **gunasthan**. **Ekendriya** and **vikaleindriya** beings do not have **gunasthan** beyond the first and second. Therefore, the **avandhakala** of the **41 prakritis** mentioned in the **gama** is explained in relation to **panchendriya** beings.

However, it should be kept in mind that those **panchendriya** beings who become **samyagdristi** (enlightened) do not experience the binding of these **41 prakritis**.

## Shataka

It is not possible for the karmas to be shed unless the being falls from Samyaktva and enters the first or second Gunasthan. However, even after entering the first or second Gunasthan, sometimes these karmas do not bind. Keeping all these points in mind, the excellent Abandhkal (time of non-binding) of these karmas is explained in these two verses.

These forty-one karmas are divided into three parts and their Abandhkal is explained. The first part includes seven karmas, the second part includes nine karmas, and the third part includes twenty-five karmas. The names of the seven karmas included in the first part are: Tiryanchantik (Tiryanchati, Tiryanchanupurvi, Niyantrayu), Naraknik (Narakgati, Narakanupurvi, Narakayu) and Udyotu.

The excellent Abandhkal of these karmas is explained as follows: A being with a lifespan of three Palyas is born in the Devakuru Bhogbhumi. There, these seven karmas do not bind to him. Because these seven karmas are related to Narak, Tiryanch Gati, and Bhocch. Therefore, these karmas bind only to those who can be born in Narakgati or Tiryanch Gati. However, the beings in Bhogbhumi, after death, become Devas according to their Karma. Therefore, these karmas related to Narak, Tiryanch Gati do not bind to them. 

After that, in Bhogbhumi, he attains Samyaktva and is born as a Deva with a lifespan of one Palyas. Therefore, due to Samyaktva, he does not bind these seven karmas there either. After that, he dies in Devagati while being in Samyaktva and is born in Manushya Gati. He then takes Diksha and becomes a Navam Veyak Deva with a lifespan of 31 Sagaraopam. At the end of his birth, he loses Samyaktva and becomes a Mithyadristi. Even after becoming a Mithyadristi, these seven karmas do not bind to him from birth because he is a Navam Veyak Deva. 

Page #248:
---------------------------
## Panam Karmagranth

Because of this, his bondage did not occur. There, at the time of death, he attained **Kshayopaśama Samyaktva** and was born in **Manayagati**, where he took on the **Mahavana** and was born twice in **Vijayādik**. He then became a human again. There, he deviated from **Samyaktva** for the final moment and went to the **third mixed Gunasthāna**. He again attained **Kshayopaśama Samyaktva** and was born three times in **Achyuta Svarga**. Thus, there are 31 **Sāgara** of **Veyaka**, 66 **Māgara** from being born twice in **Vijayādik**, and 66 **Sāgara** from being born three times in **Achyuta Svarga**, totaling 163 **Sāgara**. To this, we should add the lifespan of **Devakuru** and **Bhogabhūmija**, which is three **Palla**, and the lifespan of **Devagati**, which is one **Palla**, making a total of four **Palla**. We should also add the time spent in human births, making a total of four **Palla** plus one hundred and sixty-three **Sāgara**, which is the **Abandha Kāla** of the seven **Prakṛti**.

According to the **Prāthika** view, a being can fall from the **fourth Gunasthāna** to the **third Gunasthāna**. However, the **Maiddhanthika** view contradicts this. **Miśra Gunasthāna** is not a place where a being can fall from **Samyaktva** into **Mithyātva**.

**Paliyāi tini bhogāṇimmi mama paccayam paliya megam. Sohamme mamman narabhave sab viraiṇ.**

**Miśśī bhavapaccapano neviuje sāgarāiṁ igatoś. Aṁśamukhnunāi sammattam tammi lihiṇam.**

**Virayanar apavanarimō aguttagamagae 7 aaya chāuṭṭī. Miśa mahattamegam kāmiya maṇulo puṇo vigōṁ.**

**Chāuṭṭī ayaṇam achyuaye virayan rabhavantaritō. Tirinaravatigujjoyāṇ es kālo abandhami.**

## Matak

The statement in the Veyak that describes the fall from Samyaktv during this Abandhkal is made because the peak time of Kshayopaśamika Samyaktv is 66 Sagars. Similarly, the statement in Vijayādik that describes the transition to the third Gunasthan for the final moment in the human realm after 66 Sagars is also made because of the completion of 66 Sagars of Samyaktv. The peak state of Kshayopaśamika Samyaktv is 66 Sagars.

The second part includes the four categories of stationary beings (sthāvar, sūkshma, aparyāpta, and sādhāraṇa), the one-sensory, the impaired, the mind-like, the mother-like, and the Ātap. These nine natures are either one-sensory or impaired. Their peak Abandhkal is stated to be 185 Sagars plus four Palyas, including the human realm. This is how it is: A being is born in the sixth hell with the state of 22 Sagars. There is no bondage of these natures there. Because after leaving hell, the being becomes a five-sensory, sufficient, sentient being, not one-sensory or impaired. At the time of death, it attains Samyaktv and is born in the human realm. It dies as an Anuvrati and is born among the gods who have a lifespan of four Palyas. From there, it is born in the human realm and, after attaining Mahāvat, becomes a god in the ninth Veyak with the state of 31 Sagars. After the final moment, it becomes Mithyāiṣṭi. At the end, it attains Samyādṛṣṭi and is born in the human realm. It then attains Mahāvat and is born twice in Vijayādik, thus completing 66 Sagars. As before, it becomes Sambhag-Mithyāiṣṭi for the final moment in the human realm and then attains Samyaktv again. It is born three times in the Achyut heaven, thus completing 66 Sagars for the second time.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

**"The total of all these periods, including the human existence, is 185 Sagaras, which is the highest Abandhakal for the four Palyas, plus 22 + 31 + 66 ÷ 66 = 185 Sagaras."**

The third section lists the names of the 25 Prakṛtis that were taken: Ṛṣabhanārāca, Nārāca, Ardhanārāca, Kīlikā, Sevārta, Sanhanana, Nyagrodha, Sādi, Vāmana, Kubja, Huṇḍa, Sansthāna, Aśubha, Vihāyogati, Anantānubandhī, Krodha, Māna, Māyā, Lobha, Mithyātva, Dubhang, Duḥsvara, Anādeya, Nidrānidrā, Pracala, Rahayānakī, Nīca, Napuṁ, Strīveda.

**"The Abandhakal for these twenty-five Prakṛtis, including the human existence, is 132 Sagaras. This should be understood as follows: A being, after attaining Mahāvrat and dying, is born twice in Vijaya, etc., and thus completes the highest period of Samyaktva, which is 66 Sagaras. Again, in the human existence, it comes to the mixed Guṇasthāna for a moment and then attains Samyaktva again, and is born three times in Acyuta heaven, completing the period of Samyaktva for the second time, which is 66 Sagaras. Thus, 66 + 66 = 132. Therefore, the highest Abandhakal for the said twenty-five Prakṛtis, including the human existence, is 132 Sagaras."**

Having explained the highest Abandhakal for the said forty-one Prakṛtis, we now explain the highest Abandhakal for the said Prakṛtis.

**"The twenty-two: 1. The six Neraiyo Bhava-paccayo, the upper defao, and the Bhavidam Paliyacakkam in the first Kalpa. The Pubbatakāla-joga is Pancha-tiya, Samya, Sac-upalakṣa. Ayadathāvara-cau-vigalatīya, Gaye, Ginḍiya."**

**"2. The twenty-nine Abandha, the highest, is attained by the Sammasīsa-juē. Basī, Sayamaya-rā, two Vijaya, and three Bhava."**

## 214

Why are there 193 Sagaras in the Abandhakal of the Sagara Adi? And what is the most excellent and the most inferior proof of the continuous Abandhakal of the Anubandhini Prakrutis?

**Verse 58:**

**Vijayadi Vijje Tamai Dahisay Butos Tesaram. Panasi Sayaybandhi Pallatigam Suravidviduge.**

**Word Meaning:**

* **Vijayadi:**  The state of being victorious, like the Vijaya, Vaijayanta, Jayanta, and Aparajita Vimanas.
* **Tamai:**  The state of being in darkness, like the Tamas Prabha Naraka.
* **Dahisay:**  One hundred.
* **Butos:**  Thirty-two.
* **Tesaram:**  Sixty-four.
* **Panasi:**  One hundred and fifty.
* **Sayaybandhi:**  Continuous Abandhakal.
* **Pallatigam:**  Three Palyas.
* **Suravidviduge:**  Devadvika and Vaikriyadvika.

**Verse Meaning:**

The most excellent Abandhakal of a Jiva who has gone to the Vijayadi and the Tamas Prabha and Graiveyaka is one hundred and thirty-two, one hundred and sixty-four, and one hundred and fifty Sagaras respectively, including the Manushya Bhav. The continuous Abandhakal of the Devadvika and Vaikriyadvika is three Palyas.

**Special Meaning:**

The previous two verses explained the most excellent Abandhakal of the 41 Prakrutis. This verse indicates how that happens and also mentions the continuous Abandhakal of some of the 73 Adhruvabandhini Prakrutis.

Although the explanation of Akal has been given in the meaning of the previous two verses, it is repeated here for the sake of the context.

One hundred and thirty-two Sagaras are like this: When a Jiva takes birth twice in one of the Vijaya, Vaijayanta, Jayanta, and Aparajita Vimanas, then 66 Sagaras are completed in one birth. Then, for the duration of an Antarmuhurta, the Jiva comes to the third Gunasthan and then again takes birth three times in the Achyuta Svarga.

## The Fifth Karma Text
### 215

Sixty-six Sagaras are completed when a being takes birth for the second time. When a being is born in the Vijayadik category, 132 Sagaras are completed.

One hundred and sixty-six Sagaras are completed in this way: A being, after experiencing thirty-one Sagaras in the ninth *Praveyak* (realm of existence), is expelled from there and takes birth in the human realm. Then, after going twice to the Vijayadik category and completing sixty-six Sagaras twice, one hundred and sixty-six Sagaras are completed.

One hundred and seventy-five Sagaras are completed in this way: A being, after completing twenty-two Sagaras in the sixth hell called *Tamahprabha*, experiences thirty-one Sagaras in the ninth *Praveyak*, and then completes sixty-six Sagaras twice in the Vijayadik category, thus completing a period of one hundred and seventy-five Sagaras.

In this way, the forty-one *Prakritis* (categories of karma) do not bind the five-sensed being for more than this period.

Beginning the discussion of the least and greatest duration of the continuous binding of the *Adhruvabandhini* *Prakritis* (categories of karma), we first explain the greatest duration of binding: The *Pallati* (a unit of time), *Survi* (a unit of time), *Undhidu* (a unit of time), and *Ge* (a unit of time) - that is, the *Devadvik* (heavenly realm and its precursor) and *Vaikriyadrik* (Vaikriya body and its limbs) - these four *Prakritis* can be bound for a maximum of three *Pallyas* if their binding remains constant. The reason for this is that the *Bhogabhumij* (those who experience the fruits of their karma) beings, from birth, bind these four *Prakritis* for a period of three *Pallyas*. Because the *Bhogabhumij* beings do not bind the *Prakritis* of *Namakarma* (karma that determines the nature of the soul) that are responsible for the hell, *Tiyantra* (intermediate realm), and human realms, even if there is a difference in the results, these four *Prakritis* are not bound by any opposing *Prakriti*.

The next four verses list the remaining natures and their continuous bondage time.

**563**

From one time to countless times, the end moment of the karma of the two-wheeled and low-caste beings, the countless revolutions of the generous body, the bondage of the seven-sense beings, less than the previous koti years.

## Chapter 21

There is a continuous, excellent binding of the thirty-three Sagaropama, which are the **Sanhanan** and **Audarik Angopaanga** **Naamakarma**. The **Chaar Aayu** and **Tirthankara Naamakarma** have a continuous, inferior binding, which is also **Antamuhurta**.

**Special Note:** These four verses explain the names of the **Adhruvbandhini** **Prakritis** and the time of their continuous, excellent binding. The time of their continuous, inferior binding is not mentioned because, being **Adhruvbandhini**, they can be formed again after a certain time.

The continuous binding time of all **Prakritis** is not the same. Therefore, they are classified into groups based on their similar binding time, and their binding time is explained accordingly.

The binding time of **Tiryanchdrik** (**Tiryanchgati**, **TiryanchAnupurvi**) and **Neecha Goon** can be from one time to countless times - **Samayaadasankaalaan Tiriduniyaes**. This is because these three **Prakritis** are bound for a short time from the inferior, as their opposite **Prakritis** can be bound at other times. However, when a being is born in **Tejaskaay** and **Vayukaay**, their **Tiryanchdrik** and **Neecha Goon** are continuously bound as long as they remain in that state. Beings in **Tejaskaay** and **Vayukaay** do not have any other **Gati** or **Anupurvi** binding except **Tiryanchdrik**, nor do they have any **Uchcha Goon**. A being born in **Tejaskaay** and **Vayukaay** traverses countless regions of **Lokakasha** and continues to be born in **Tejaskaay** and **Vayukaay** for a very long time. Therefore, the excellent continuous binding time of these three **Prakritis** is countless times, i.e., ...

The countless ascending, descending, and stationary souls are bound in the seven hells. These three natures are continuously bound even in the seventh hell.

The four natures of Ayukarma - hell, animal, human, and divine - have a very short and fleeting lifespan... because Ayukarma is bound only once in a lifetime, and that too for a maximum of a few moments.

The time of binding for the Audarik body, a type of Namkarma, ranges from the lowest to the highest, and is countless Pugal Paravarta. This is because a soul can bind the Audarik body for a period of time and then bind its opposite, the Baakriya body, etc. The time of countless Pugal Paravarta is considered because a soul born in a stationary body can remain in that body for countless Pugal Paravarta. During this time, it does not bind any other body except the Audarik.

The highest binding time for the seven Vedaniya is slightly less than one Purva Koti. When a soul binds the seven Vedaniya for a period of time and then binds its opposite, the Asata Vedaniya, for another period, then its time is considered as one period. When a Karmabhoomi human, after the age of eight, takes the Jain initiation and attains Kevalgyan, then for a period slightly more than eight years and less than one Purva Koti, the seven Vedaniya are continuously bound. This is because after the sixth Gunasthan, the opposite nature of the seven Vedaniya, the Asata Vedaniya, is not bound. And the highest lifespan of a Karmabhoomi human is one Purva Koti. Therefore...

Century
The continuous excellent bondage period of the seven Vedaniya is said to be one previous koti less than eight years more.
The names of the natures that bind continuously up to one hundred and fifty oceans are as follows - 'Parghussase Panidi Tasachouge-Paraghate, Ucchvasa, Panchendriya jati and Trasachatuska, Kul these seven natures are. Due to the Adhruvbandhini nature of these natures, their continuous bondage period is at least one time. Because after one time, their opposite natures take their place and the excellent continuous bondage period is one hundred and fifty oceans.
Although the verse states that the excellent time of continuous bondage of the seven natures mentioned is one hundred and fifty oceans and the Panchasangraha also says the same. But four palyas should be added to it. Because the bondage period of these is as much as the abanyakal of their opposite natures. In verse 56, the excellent abandhakal of their opposite natures, the immovable chatushk etc., is said to be four palyas more than one hundred and fifty sagaropama, therefore their bondage

## The Fifth Compendium

One should understand time in the same way. Because it is only during their *avandha* period that their bondage can occur. This measure of time should be understood as follows:

A being, bound by twenty-two *sāgara* of *sthitibandha*, is born in the sixth hell. There, due to the absence of bondage of the seven *prakṛtis* (parādhāt, etc.) and their opposing *prakṛtis*, these seven *prakṛtis* remain continuously unbound. At the end of their time, they attain *samyaktvā* and are born in the human realm. Here, by observing *aṇuvrata*, they are born as a deity with four *palyas* of existence. Dying with *samyaktvā*, they are reborn as a human. After attaining *mahāvat* and dying, they become a deity in the ninth *veyaka*, living for thirty-one *sāgara*. There, they die with *mithyāiṣṭi* and again attain *samyaktvā*, being reborn as a human. From there, they die three times and are born in the *achyuta* heaven. In this way, they complete sixty-six *sāgara*. For the final moment, they come to the third *min* *guṇasthāna*. After that, they again attain *samyaktvā* and are born twice in *vijayādi* realms, completing sixty-six *sāgara*. In this way, while wandering in the sixth hell, etc., the being is bound by the seven *prakṛtis* (parādhāt, etc.) sometimes due to *bhavasvabhāva* and sometimes due to *samyaktvā*.

The continuous period of bondage of the seven *prakṛtis* - *śubha vihāyogati*, *puruṣavedā*, *subhagatrika*, *ucchāgotra*, and *samacaturastra samsthāna* - is one hundred and thirty-two *sāgara*.

**1** In the commentary on the *Pañcasangraha*, the continuous period of bondage of these *prakṛtis* is stated to be one hundred and thirty-two *sāgara* plus three *palyas*. Here, it is said that a being with an existence of three *palyas*, who is a *nirya* *aśaya* human, attains *samyaktvā* at the end of their human existence. After that, they wander in the world for one hundred and thirty-two *sāgara* in order. 

Page #259:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Shank** is a **Māgar**. Due to their **Anubandhini** natures, their **Jghanya Bandhakal** is one **Samaya**, but their **Utkrisht Bandhakal** is one hundred and thirty-two **Sāgar**. This is because in **Gāthā 57**, the **Utkrisht Akāl** of their opposing natures is stated as one hundred and thirty-two **Sāgar**. Therefore, their **Bandhakal** should be understood in the same order.

The names of the forty-one **Prakritis** that bind from one **Samaya** to **Antarmūhūrta** are as follows:

* **Ashubha Vihāyogati**
* **Ashubha Jāti Chatushk** (Ekeindriya, Dwiindriya, Bindriya, Chaturindriya)
* **Vajraṛṣabhanārāch**
* **Sanhanan** (excluding the remaining five **Ashubha Sanhanan** like **Ṛṣabhanārāva**)
* **Nyagrodhaparimandala** (excluding the remaining five **Ashubha Sansthān** like **Nyagrodhaparimandala**)
* **Āhārakalik**
* **Narakadrik**
* **Udyotvik**
* **Sthira**
* **Shubha**
* **Yasha Kirti**
* **Sthāvar Dashak**
* **Napumsakaved**
* **Strived**
* **Yugaladvik**
* **(Hāsya, Rati, and Shoka - Arati)**
* **Asāta Vedaniya**

The continuous **Bandhakal** of the above forty-one **Prakritis** is stated to be at least one **Samaya** and at most **Antarmūhūrta**. These **Prakritis** are **Adhṛuvabandhini**, therefore, when their opposing **Prakritis** have the material for binding, their binding stops after **Antarmūhūrta**.

The reason for considering the **Antarmūhūrta** as the **Utkrisht Kāla** for the continuous binding of these forty-one **Prakritis** is that the opposing **Prakritis** of **Sāta Vedaniya**, **Rati**, **Hāsya**, **Sthira**, **Shubha**, and **Yasha Kirti** are **Asāta Vedaniya**, **Arati Shoka**, **Asthira**, **Ashubha**, and **Ayasha Kirti**, and their binding occurs until the sixth **Gunasthan**. Therefore, their continuous binding until **Antarmūhūrta** occurs until that point. However, their **Bandhakal** is also **Antarmūhūrta** in the subsequent **Gunasthanas**, because the time of those **Gunasthanas** is also **Antarmūhūrta** in measure.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

**Human-like (Human Path, Human Precedence), Tirthankara Name, Vanrishabhanaraaj Samhanan, the continuous time of the best and the worst of the thirty-three Sagars is contained within the Gogank. This is because the nature of the Anuttara Vasi Devas is bound to the Human Path. As a result, from the time of their birth until the age of thirty-three Sagars, they do not bind the five inauspicious Samhanan, Rishabhanaraach, etc., which are opposite to the said natures, namely Narakdvick, Tiryanchdvick, Devdvick, Vaikriyadvick.**

**There is no nature opposite to the Tirthankara nature, therefore its binding also remains constant until the thirty-three Sagars.**

**Among the five aforementioned natures, the time of the worst binding of the four natures excluding the Tirthankara nature is one time, because they have opposite natures.**

**Generally, it has been stated that the time of the worst binding of the Adhruvbandhini natures is one time. However, due to the special nature of the time of the worst binding of some natures, the Granthakar has indicated that 'Lahuu Vi Aau. Jine' the time of the worst binding of the four Ayukarma and the Tirthankara name karma is also Antmuhurt. That is, the best and worst binding time of the Tirthankara name karma and the four Ayus, namely Narakayu, etc., is only Annamuhurt. It is not that the worst binding time is one time and the best binding time is Antmuhurt.**

**Regarding the binding time of Ayukarma, it has been previously stated that the binding of Ayus occurs only once in a Bhava and that too only for Antmuhurt. The time of the worst binding of the Tirthankara nature should be understood in this way: a being binds the Tirthankara nature and ascends to the Upsham श्रेणि, from there until the eleventh Gunasthan, the Tirthankara nature is not bound because the binding of the Tirthankara nature is prohibited...** 

Page #261:
---------------------------
The **Shataka** (century) occurs in the sixth part of the eighth **Gunasthan**. Again, falling from the **Upshama Shreni**, until the **Antamuhurta**, the being, bound by the **Tirthankara** nature, ascends the **Upshama Shreni** and becomes unbound there. At that time, the **Jghanya Andhakala** (dark period) of the **Tirthankara** nature occurs at the **Antamuhurta**. Thus, with the statement of the **Baishwakala** (universal time) of the **Adhruvabandhini** (non-permanent) natures, the discussion of **Sthitibandha** (state-binding) is complete. Now, we discuss **Rasabandh** (taste-binding) or **Anubhaga Bandh** (experience-binding). **Rasabandh** is one of the four divisions of **Bandha** (binding) - **Prakriti** (nature), **Pradesh** (region), **Sthiti** (state), and **Ras** (taste). After describing **Prakritibandha** and **Sthitibandha**, we now describe **Rasabandh** or **Anubhaga Bandh**. First, the author explains the causes of **Tivra** (intense) and **Manda** (mild) **Anubhaga Bandh** for **Shubha** (auspicious) and **Ashubha** (inauspicious) natures.

**Timro Asuhasuhaanam Sanke Savilohio Vivjayau. Mabaraso Girimhahirayajalarehasarisakasaehi. ||6|| Chauthaanaai Asuha Sunha Vigghade Saghai Avarana. Pumsanjalani Gabuti Chauthaana Rasa Ses Dugamai. ||4||**

**Word Meaning:** **Simbo** - intense, **Bhasuhasuhaanam** - auspicious and inauspicious natures, **Sanke Savilohio** - by **Samklesha** (affliction) and **Vishuddhi** (purification), **Vivjayau** - conquered.

**Mo:** In the **Karmakanda**, only the **Jghanya Bandhakala** (minimum binding time) of the **Adhruvabandhini** natures is mentioned.

**Avaro Bhisan Muhatto Tityaharaana Satan Aaunam. Samao Chavatthiinam Bandho Tamha Drudha Sesaa. ||126||**

The **Jghanya Kala** (minimum time) for the continuous binding of **Tirthankara**, **Aharaknik** (food-taker), and the four **Ayus** (life spans) is the **Antamuhurta**, and the **Jghanya Kala** for the continuous binding of the remaining six **Prakrtis** (natures) is one **Samaya** (time).

## The Fifth Karma Granth

**From the opposite of:**

* **Manderaso-Manderas** (subtle-subtle)
* **Girimahirpajalreha** (the line of mountain, earth, sand, and water)

**By the Kshaya (passions):**

* **Chauthaanaai** (four-place) - **Asuha** (inauspicious)
* **Suha Maha** (auspicious) - **opposite**
* **Vindhavesdhaiavaranaantaraya** (five obstacles)
* **Deshavaati Avarana** (country-destroying covering)
* **Prakritiya** (natures)
* **Pumsanjalan** (male-knowledge)
* **Sanjwalan** (burning)
* **Kshaya** (passions)
* **Igadusi Chauthaana Rasa** (one, two, three, four place-flavored)
* **Sesa** (remaining)
* **Prakritiya** (natures)
* **Sugamai** (two, etc.)

**I**

**Place-flavored**

**225**

**Meaning:**

The inauspicious and auspicious natures bind through the intense flavor sequence by affliction and purification. Like the line drawn in the mountain, earth, sand, and water, by the Kshaya (passions).

The inauspicious natures have four-place, etc., flavors, and the auspicious natures have four-place, etc., flavors by the opposite. The five obstacles, country-destroying covering natures, male-knowledge and burning passions, these natures bind as one-place, two-place, three-place, and four-place flavored, and the remaining natures bind as two-place, etc., three types of flavored.

**Special Meaning:**

In the world, Karma particles are widespread. These Karma particles do not have any kind of flavor-fruit-producing power before binding with the soul. But when they are taken by the soul, at the time of taking, they get infinite flavor by getting the cause of the soul's Kshaya (passions) results, which, in their ripening, give their own fruits in that form, destroying the qualities of the soul. 

Page #263:
---------------------------
## Chapter 226

Therefore, the power of karmic particles to bear fruit is called **rasabandh** or **anubhag bandh**. This will now be explained with an example: Just as dry grass is tasteless, but when it reaches the stomachs of a camel, buffalo, cow, and goat, it transforms into milk, and different levels of richness are seen in its taste. That is, by eating the same dry grass, the camel gives very thick milk, and it also has a lot of creaminess. Buffalo milk has less thickness and creaminess than that. Cow's milk has even less thickness and creaminess, and goat's milk has less thickness and creaminess than cow's milk. Just as the same grass transforms into different forms of milk in the stomachs of different animals, similarly, the same type of karmic atoms, due to the different karmic results of different beings, become different in taste. They bear fruit in due time.

Just as camel's milk has more strength and goat's milk has less, similarly, both auspicious and inauspicious natures have both intense and mild **anubhag bandh**. That is, there are two types of **anubhag bandh**: **intense anubhag bandh** and **mild anubhag bandh**. Both these types of **anubhag bandh** occur in auspicious natures as well as in inauspicious natures. Therefore, the author has begun the description of **anubhag bandh** by explaining the causes of intense and mild **anubhag bandh** in auspicious and inauspicious natures.

It has been said that intense **anubhag bandh** occurs in inauspicious natures due to **samklesha** results, and auspicious natures due to pure emotions.

## Fifth Karma Granth

There are three sections of bondage in the *prakritis* (natural tendencies), and conversely, there is a mild section of bondage from opposite emotions. This means that there is a mild section of bondage in the *ashubh prakritis* (inauspicious tendencies) from pure emotions, and a mild section of bondage in the *shubh prakritis* (auspicious tendencies) from *sanklesha* emotions (emotions that bind).

The section of the *ashubh prakritis* is compared to the bitter juice of neem, while the section of the *shubh prakritis* is compared to the juice of sugarcane. This is explained as follows: just as the juice of neem is bitter, so too is the juice of the *ashubh prakritis* considered bad because they yield inauspicious fruits. The juice of sugarcane is sweet and delicious, just as the juice of the *shubh prakritis* is pleasant.

Both *ashubh* and *shubh* *prakritis* have four stages each of intense and mild juice. These were only hinted at in the explanation of verse 2 of the first *karma granth*. Here, we will state them in more detail.

The four types of stages of the three and *sand* juices are as follows: 1. *Totra*, 2. *Tivratar*, 3. *Tivratam*, 4. *Atyanta Tivra*, and 1. *Mand*, 2. *Mandatar*, 3. *Mandatam*, and 4. *Atyanta Mand*. Although there are countless types of these, one should know the countless types of each, but all of them are included in these four stages. These four types are called *ekasthānik*, *dvisthānik*, *tristhānik*, and *chatuḥsthānik* respectively. This means that *ekasthānik* should be understood as *totra* or *mand*, *dvisthānik* as *tivratar* or *mandatar*, *tristhānik* as *tivratam* or *mandatam*, and *chatuḥsthānik* as *atyant tivra* or *atyant mand*.

These should be understood in this way: just as the juice of neem that is extracted immediately is naturally bitter, which is its three stages. When that juice...

## Chapter 228

If a *sar* of something cooked on fire is reduced to half a *sar*, it becomes more bitter. This is a more intense state. When it is reduced to one-third of a *sar*, it becomes the most bitter. This is the most intense state. And when it is reduced to a quarter of a *sar*, it becomes extremely bitter. This is the extremely intense state. This is an illustration of the four states of intense *rasa* (experience) of inauspicious natures.

The illustration of the four states of intense *rasa* of auspicious natures is as follows: Just as the natural juice that comes out when sugarcane is crushed is naturally sweet, when that juice is cooked on fire and reduced to half a *sar*, it becomes sweeter. When it is reduced to one-third of a *sar*, it becomes the sweetest. And when it is reduced to a quarter of a *sar*, it becomes extremely sweet. In this way, one should understand the four states of *totra rasa*.

Now, we will clarify the four states of *manda rasa*. Just as the bitter *rasa* of *nom* or the sweet *rasa* of sugarcane becomes mild when a spoonful of water is added to it, it becomes milder when a glass of water is added, it becomes the mildest when a pitcher of water is added, and it becomes extremely mild when a pot of water is added. Similarly, one should understand the mild, milder, mildest, and extremely mild states of *manda rasa* of inauspicious and auspicious natures.

The reason for this intensity and mildness is the intensity and mildness of *kṣaya*. Intense *kṣaya* binds *totra* in inauspicious natures and *mantra* experience in auspicious natures. And mild *kṣaya* binds *manda* in inauspicious natures and intense experience in auspicious natures. In other words, the increase of *saṃdeśa* results and the decrease of pure results bind the intense, more intense, most intense, and extremely intense *anubhāga* of inauspicious natures. And the increase of pure results and the decrease of *saṃkleśa* results bind the mild, milder, mildest, and extremely mild *anubhāga* of auspicious natures.

There are three sections of bondage: **Tivra**, **Tivratar**, **Tivratam**, and **Atyanta**.  And there are four sections of bondage for the **Ashubha** (unfortunate) natures: **Mand**, **Mandatar**, **Mandatam**, and **Atyanta-Mand**.

Now, we will explain the causes of these four sections of bondage for the three **Mand** sections.  The causes are: **Girimahir-Yajal-Reha-Saris-Kasahim** -  meaning, the bondage is caused by the results of **Kashaya** (passions) that are like the line of a mountain, the line of the earth, the line of a flower, and the line of water, respectively.  These results cause the **Atyanta-Tivra** (Chatur-Sthanik), **Tivratam** (Tristhanik), **Tivratar** (Dvisthanik), and **Tivra** (Ekasthanik) sections of bondage.  This explanation is given with respect to the **Ashubha** natures.  For the **Shubha** (fortunate) natures, the opposite should be understood.  That is, the **Atyanta-Tivra** (Chatur-Sthanik) bondage is caused by the results like the line of water and dust, the **Tivratam** (Tristhanik) bondage is caused by the results like the line of the earth, and the **Tivratar** (Dvisthanik) bondage is caused by the results like the line of a mountain.  There is no **Tivra** (Ekasthanik) bondage for the **Shubha** natures, which will be explained in detail later.

Previously, it was explained that the cause of **Anubhag Bandha** (sectional bondage) is **Kashaya**.  The four sections of **Tivra**, **Tivratar**, etc. and **Mand**, **Mandatar**, etc. are all sections of **Anubhag Bandha**.  The cause of these sections is the state of **Hetu Kashayik** (passion-related) results.  There are four types of **Kashaya**: **Krodha** (anger), **Mana** (pride), **Maya** (deceit), and **Lobha** (greed).  Each of these has four states.  That is, there are four states of **Krodha Kashaya**.  Similarly, there are four states of **Mana**, **Maya**, and **Lobha**.  These states are called: **Ananta-Anubandhi Kashaya**, **Apratyakhyana-Avarana Kashaya**, **Pratyakhyana-Avarana Kashaya**, and **Sanjwalana Kashaya**.  The **Shastrakaras** (scriptural scholars) have given four metaphors for these four **Kashaya**, which are indicated in the **Gapa**.  **Ananta-Anubandhi Rushaya**...

**Matka** is compared to the line on a mountain. Just as a crack in a mountain does not disappear even after hundreds of years, similarly, the **Anantānubandhi Kṣaya** (infinitely connected passions) remains for countless lifetimes.  **Inay** has said that the results of a living being are extremely complex and the **Pāpa Prakṛtis** (negative tendencies) bind through the **Chatur-sthānika Anubhāga** (four-fold division of experience). However, the **Śubha Prakṛtis** (positive tendencies) only bind through the **Dvi-sthānika Rasa** (two-fold division of experience), because there is no **Eka-sthānika Rasa** (one-fold division of experience) in the **Śubha Prakṛtis**.

**A-pratyākhyāna-āvaraṇa Kṣaya** is compared to the line on the earth. Just as cracks appear in the ground when the water in a pond dries up and these cracks are filled in with time, similarly, **A-pratyākhyāna-āvaraṇa Kṣaya** is such that its **Vāsanā** (latent tendencies) also subsides in due time. When this **Kṣaya** arises, there is **Vi-sthānika Rasa** (two-fold division of experience) in both the **A-śubha Prakṛtis** (negative tendencies) and the **Śubha Prakṛtis** (positive tendencies). This means that there is **Katu-kṣama** (bitter) and **Madhura-tama** (sweetest) **Anubhāga** (division of experience) binding.

**Pratyākhyāna-āvaraṇa Kṣaya** is compared to the line on sand or dust. Just as a line drawn on sand is not permanent and is quickly erased, similarly, the **Vāsanā** of **Pratyākhyāna-āvaraṇa Kṣaya** should be understood as not lasting for a long time. When this **Kṣaya** arises, there is **Dvi-sthānika** (two-fold division of experience) in the **Pāpa Prakṛtis** (negative tendencies), meaning **Katu-kṣama** (bitter), and **Chatur-sthānika** (four-fold division of experience) in the **Puṇya Prakṛtis** (positive tendencies).

**Sanjvalana Kṣaya** is compared to the line on water. Just as a line drawn on water disappears immediately after being drawn, similarly, the **Vāsanā** of **Sanjvalana Kṣaya** is also destroyed in an instant. When this **Kṣaya** arises, there is **Chatur-sthānika** (four-fold division of experience) in the **Puṇya Prakṛtis** (positive tendencies).

The fifth karma-pātya is 21 and in the pāpa-prakṛtis, only the ekasthānika, i.e., the katuka form, is rasa-bandha. Thus, in the ashubha-prakṛtis, the anantānubandhi, apratyākhyānāvaraṇa, pratyākhyānāvaraṇa, and sanjvalana kapāyas have, respectively, chatusthānika, tristhānika, dvisthānika, and ekasthānika rasa-bandha, and in the shubha-prakṛtis, they have dvisthānika, tristhānika, and chatusthānika rasa-bandha.

By explaining the four kapāyas due to the four types of anubhāga-bandha, it is now clarified how many types of rasa-bandha occur in which prakṛti. There are 120 prakṛtis that are bandha-yogya, of which 82 are ashubha-prakṛtis and 42 are shubha-prakṛtis. Of these 12 pāpa-prakṛtis, antarāya karma has 5, jñānāvaraṇa has 4 except for the kevalajñānāvaraṇa, darśanāvaraṇa has 3 except for the kevaladarśanāvaraṇa, chakshu darśanāvaraṇa, etc., the sanjvalana kapāya chatushk, and purushaveda, these 17 prakṛtis have all four types of rasa-bandha, i.e., ekasthānika, dvisthānika, tristhānika, and chatusthānika. Because these 17 prakṛtis are deshaghātini. The ghātini prakṛtis, which are sarvaghatini, have all their spardhakas as sarvaghatis, but the deshaghātini prakṛtis have some spardhakas as sarvaghatis and some as deshaghātis. The spardhakas that have tristhānika and chatusthānika rasa are accepted in both punya and pāpa forms due to the punya and pāpa forms of the vaṇachatushk. When they are accepted in the punya-prakṛtis, then they should not be accepted in the punya-prakṛtis when they are accepted in the pāpa-prakṛtis.

They are all destructive by rule, and those competitors who have a two-place rasa are both traitors and destructive, but competitors who have a one-place rasa are only traitors. Therefore, all these natures are considered to have four types of rasa-bandha: one, two, three, and four-place. Their one-place rasa-bandha binds after the numerical part of the ninth guna-sthana has passed, and in the guna-sthana below the ninth anivritti-vadar guna-sthana, there is two-place, three-place, and four-place rasa-bandha, but not one-place rasa-bandha. Because there are 65 sinful natures in the remaining natures, and their binding does not occur after the numerical part of the ninth guna-sthana has passed. That is, the one-place rasa-bandha of the inauspicious natures occurs only after the numerical part of the ninth anivritti-vadar guna-sthana has passed, and there, except for the aforementioned 17 natures of antaray etc., the remaining inauspicious natures do not bind at all. Therefore, the one-place rasa-bandha of the remaining 65 natures does not occur. These 65 natures also include only-knowledge-obscuration and only-vision-obscuration. But it should be understood about these two natures that their binding occurs up to the tenth guna-sthana, but because they are destructive, they do not have one-place rasa-bandha.
The remaining 42 virtuous natures also do not have one-place rasa-bandha. The reason for this is that just as the number of steps that have to be climbed to go up is the same as the number of steps that have to be descended to go down, so also the complex resultant jiva climbs to as many places of complexity

The Fifth Karma Granth

It is said that when pure emotions arise, the soul ascends from the state of being bound to the state of liberation. And as it ascends through the stages of purification, it descends through the same number of stages of defilement when it falls back. Thus, there are as many stages of defilement as there are stages of purification. However, when considering the perspective of the क्षपक श्रेणि (Kshapaka Shreni), the stages of purification are more numerous than the stages of entry. Because the soul, which is ascending through the stages of purification, does not descend below those stages. If there were an equal number of stages of defilement as stages of purification, then the soul would inevitably fall back in the same way as it does in the उपशम श्रेणि (Upshama Shreni). But this does not happen. Once the soul ascends through the क्षपक श्रेणि (Kshapaka Shreni), it does not descend. This implies that the number of stages of purification is greater than the number of stages of defilement in the क्षपक श्रेणि (Kshapaka Shreni).

While there are stages of purification, only the four-fold bond of auspicious natures occurs. And when there are extreme stages of defilement, there is no bond of auspicious natures at all. Some beings, at the time of extreme defilement, bind auspicious natures like the body of a hell-bound being, etc. But due to their nature of existence, they only have a two-fold bond at that time. And even those auspicious natures that bind with medium results have a two-fold bond. Therefore, there is never a one-fold bond of auspicious natures.

In this way, by explaining the stages of the bond of the parts, their causes, the stages of karma, and how many natures have a four-fold bond, etc., the special nature of auspicious and inauspicious karma is explained.

"The subtle, natural, three-part, four-fold bond is acquired. The bond of the body is inauspicious, while the bond of the mind is auspicious." (15)

**Verse Meaning:**

Neem and sugarcane's natural juice, when boiled in two, three, and four parts, leaving one part remaining, should be known as the unfavorable juice of unfavorable natures, one-place, etc., and the favorable juice of favorable natures.

**Special Meaning:**

The previous verse explained the four types of *anubhag bandh* - one-place, two-place, etc. This verse further clarifies them and also hints at the nature of favorable and unfavorable natures.

Unfavorable natures are compared to neem and their juice to neem juice, while favorable natures are compared to sugarcane and their juice to sugarcane juice. Just as neem juice is naturally bitter and fills the mouth of the drinker with bitterness, so too is the juice of unfavorable natures harmful and painful. And just as sugarcane is naturally sweet and its juice is sweet and joyful, so too is the juice of favorable natures joyful for living beings.

This is generally explained that the natural juice extracted from neem and sugarcane is naturally bitter and sweet. This bitterness and sweetness should be known as one-place juice. The two-place, three-place, and four-place types of this natural one-place juice should be understood as follows... 

Page #272:
---------------------------
## The Five Karma Granth

It is said that if one takes one seer each of neem and sugarcane juice and boils them until they are reduced to half a seer, then it is called **Dwistahanik Rasa**, because the cooked juice has twice the bitterness and twice the sweetness of the original natural juice. If the same juice is boiled further until it is reduced to one seer, then it should be understood as **Vistahanik Rasa**, because it has three times the bitterness or three times the sweetness of the original natural juice. When the same juice is boiled further and reduced to one-fourth of a seer, then it is called **Chatuhstahanik Rasa**, because it has four times the bitterness and four times the sweetness of the original natural juice.

Now, based on the above example, we can understand the **Ekstahanik** etc. in the context of **Ashubh** (unfavorable) and **Shubh** (favorable) natures. Just as the **Vistahanik Rasa** has twice the bitterness of the **Ekstahanik Rasa** of neem, and the **Vistahanik Rasa** has three times the bitterness, and the **Chatuhstahanik Rasa** has four times the bitterness, similarly, the **Ashubh** natures that are the most competitive and have the most **Jayanya Rasa** are called **Ekstahanik Rasa**. The **Vistahanik** competitors have an infinite amount of **Rasa** compared to them, and the **Vistahanik** competitors have an infinite amount of **Rasa** compared to them, and the **Chatuhstahanik** competitors have an infinite amount of **Rasa** compared to them. Similarly, in **Shubh** natures, it should be understood that the **Dwitiya**, **Tritiya**, and **Chaturtha** places have an infinite amount of **Shubh Rasa** compared to the **Ekstahanik**.

These four places are caused by the increasing intensity of **Kshaya** (negative karma) in **Ashubh** natures and the increasing **Kshaya** (negative karma) in **Shubh** natures. The increasing intensity of **Kshaya** leads to **Rasa** from **Ekstahanik** to **Chatuhstahanik** in **Ashubh** natures, and the increasing **Kshaya** leads to **Rasa** from **Dwistahanik** to **Chatuhstahanik** in **Shubh** natures.

"Sanka" goes. There is no one-place rasa-bandha in auspicious natures.
Thus, having described the nature, cause, and divisions of anubhaga-bandha, now we will tell about the owners of anubhaga-bandha. First, we will state the owners of excellent anubhaga-bandha.

1. In the Go karmakanda, the description of anubhaga-bandha is similar to the description in the karmagrantha, but the language is different. In it, the power of destructive karmas is divided into four parts - lana, daah, asthi and patthar (Go - 180). Just as these four substances are increasingly harder, so should the power of karmas be understood. These four divisions can be given the names of one, two, three and four places respectively. Of these, the lata part is deshghati and the baroo part's infinite part is deshghati and the remaining bahbhaag is sarvghati. The asthi and prasthar parts are only sarpaghati. By dividing the apatiks into two parts, punya and paap, four parts have been made for punya prakritis - gud, khaand, shakar and amrit, and four parts have been made for paap prakritis - neem, kanjir, visha and halaahal (Go 184). These divisions can also be given the names of one, two, three and four places respectively.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

**Verse Meaning:**

The Ekendriya (one-sensed) jati, Sthavar (stationary) and Atap (heat) karmas are bound by the Mithyadrishti Devas (false-believing gods) in their **utkrusht anubhag bandh** (superior section binding). The Vikalendriya (impaired-sensed) trik, Sukshma (subtle) trik, Narak (hell) trik, Tiryanch (animal) ayu (life) and Manusya (human) ayu are bound by the Mithyadrishti Tiryanch and Manusya in their **utkrusht anubhag bandh**. The Tiryach (animal) dwik (two) and Sewart (service) Sanhanan (accumulation) are bound by the Mithyadrishti Devas and Narakas in their **utkrusht anubhag bandh**.

**Commentary:**

There are two types of **anubhag bandh**: **utkrusht** (superior) and **jghanya** (inferior). This verse begins by explaining the nature of **anubhag bandh** and then describes the beings who experience **utkrusht anubhag bandh**. All beings in the four gatis (states of existence) create the power to experience the fruits of their karmas according to their **kapayik parinati** (individual destiny) along with their karma bandh.

This verse explains which beings in which gatis and gunasthans (levels of purity) experience **utkrusht anubhag bandh**. It states that "the Ekendriya jati, Sthavar and Atap, these three karmas are bound by the Mithyadrishti Devas in their **utkrusht anubhag bandh**." The reason why Mithyadrishti Devas experience **utkrusht anubhag bandh** of these three karmas is because Narakas (hell beings) do not take birth in the Ekendriya paryay (one-sensed state) after death, so they do not experience this bandh. And for the **utkrusht anubhag bandh** of the Atap karma, the level of purity required is such that humans and animals, if they achieve that level of purity, would be eligible to take birth in the Panchendriya (five-sensed) Tiryanch (animal) state and would experience the bandh of other auspicious karmas.

**Note:**

* The Devas mentioned here are those from the Ishaan heaven to the highest heaven. This is because only these Devas can take birth in the Ekendriya paryay after death. Devas above this level do not experience the Ekendriya paryay. 

Page #275:
---------------------------
## Pancham Farm Prasth

The **Pancham Farm Prasth** states that beings with **Ekaindriya** and **Sthavar** natures, who possess the necessary **Samklesha** (afflictions) for **Utkrisht Anubhag Bandh** (superior binding of the soul), destroy the **Ashubh Prakriti** (unfortunate natures) worthy of **Narak Gati** (hellish realm). However, even with **Utkrisht Samklesha**, beings worthy of **Narak Gati** do not experience **Bandh** (binding) due to their inherent nature. Therefore, **Narak**, **Manam**, and **Nian** (three types of beings) do not experience **Utkrisht Anubhag Bandh**, but only **Devas** (gods) from **Ishan** to **Swarg** (heavenly realms) do.

**Vikalnik** (Heindriya, Bindriya, Chaturindriya), **Sukshmatrik** (Sukshma, Sadharan, Apariapt), **Naraktrik** (Narak Gati, Narakanupurvi, Narakayu), **Tithanchayu**, and **Manushyayu** - these eleven **Prakriti** (natures) experience **Utkrisht Anubhag Bandh** through **Mithyadristi** (false belief), **Tiryanch** (animals), and **Manushya** (humans). This is because **Narak** and **Devas** do not bind the remaining nine **Prakriti** from birth, and only those beings who die and are reborn in **Bhog Bhoomi** (realm of enjoyment) experience **Utkrisht Anubhag Bandh** of **Tiryanch** and **Manushya** lifespans. Consequently, **Devas** and **Narak** cannot bind these two **Prakriti**. However, **Mithyadristi Manushya** and **Tithancha** experience **Utkrisht Anubhag Bandh** of these **Prakriti**. Similarly, other **Prakriti** experience **Utkrisht Anubhag Bandh** through **Mithyadristi Manushya** and **Tiryanch**, who possess the corresponding **Samklesha** (afflictions) and **Parinam** (results). Therefore, **Mithyadristi Manushya** and **Tiryanch** experience **Utkrisht Anubhag Bandh** of these eleven **Prakriti**.

**Tiryadugchhevat Suranirya-Tiryanchdwik** and **Sewat Nahannan** - these three **Prakriti** experience **Utkrisht Anubhag Bandh** through **Mithyadristi Devas** and **Narak**. If **Tiryanch** and **Manushya** possess the same level of **Samklesha** (afflictions), they would experience **Bandh** of **Narak Gati** worthy **Prakriti**. However, **Devas**...

## The Fifth Karma Granth

And when the results of the Naraka are extremely complex, they bind only those beings who are fit for the Tiryanch (animal) realm. Therefore, the superior sections of the aforementioned three natures are said to be the owners of the bondage of the Devas and Narakas.

Regarding the bondage of the superior sections of the aforementioned natures, one should know this specifically: The superior section of the bondage of the Seva-Sahanan (service-endurance) in the Deva realm is done by the Sanatkumar etc., who are above the Ishana heaven. When the results of the De-di (two-fold) are complex, they bind only the beings who are fit for the Ekendriya (one-sense) realm. However, Seva-Sahanan is not fit for the Ekendriya, because the Ekendriya do not have Sahanan.

These two verses mention the owners of the excellent sections of **Bandha** of the remaining **Prakṛtis** (principles) besides the seventeen **Prakṛtis** mentioned in the previous verse. Some **Prakṛtis** are named, and the owners of the excellent sections of **Bandha** of the remaining **Prakṛtis** are declared to be the **Mithyadṛṣṭi** beings of all four **Gatis**. This is explained below.

The phrase "**Viuvvīsura**" in the verse includes thirty-two **Prakṛtis** from **Vaikriya-dvi** to **Uchchhvās** and **Uchch Gotr**. The excellent section of **Bandha** of these **Prakṛtis** is acquired by humans who ascend the **Kshapaka Shroṇi**. Among these, the **Sata Vedaniya**, **Uchch Gotr** and **Sadagak** acquire the excellent section of **Bandha** of **Gabhit Yashas-kirti Namakarma** at the end of the tenth **Sukshma-samparāya Gunasthān**. This is because the **Bandha** of these three **Prakṛtis** is the most pure, and the excellent section of **Bandha** of **Punya Prakṛtis** is acquired through pure **Pariṇāmas** (results).

Except for these three **Prakṛtis**, the excellent section of **Bandha** of the remaining twenty-nine **Prakṛtis** is acquired in the sixth part of the eighth **Apūrva-karaṇa Gunasthān** in the **Dev-gati**.

The binding of the thirty-two eligible natures occurs at the time of their liberation. Among these thirty-two bound natures, the **Apuurvakaran Kshapak** is the most pure.

The names of these thirty-two natures, in the order of their Gunasthanas, are as follows:

* **Baikriya Dwika**, **Dev Dwika**, **Aaharaka Dwika**, **Shubha Viha Yogati**, **Varna Chatushk**, **Tejam Chatushk** (Tanjas, Karmanagrihalagghu, Nirman), **Tirthankara**, **Sama Chaturasra Sansthan**, **Paraghāt**, **Yash Kirti** (excluding these from the Sadashka), **Ghabhit Pras**, **Badar**, **Paryapt** and nine other natures, **Panchendriya Jati**, **Uchchvas**.

The binding of the **utkrista anubhag** of these twenty-nine natures occurs in the sixth part of the eighth **Apuurvakaran Ganasthan**, at the time of the liberation of the **Devagati** eligible natures.

The **utkrista anubhag** binding of the three natures **Sata Vedaniya**, **Yash Kirti Namakarma**, and **Uchch Gotr** occurs at the end of the tenth **Mookshma Samparaya Gunasthan**.

Having discussed the **utkrista anubhag** binding of these seventeen and thirty-two natures, we now consider the remaining natures. The **utkrista anubhag** binding of the **Tamtamga Ujjoyam** (**Tamtam Prabha Namakarma**) occurs in the seventh hell, **Naraka Udyot Namakarma**.

The reason for this is that when the **Naraka** of the seventh hell performs the three **Karana** (Yathapravritta, etc.) for attaining **Samyaktva**, he experiences **Mithyatva** in **Anivrittikaran**. This act of **Mithyatva** creates two states:

1. **Prathama Sthiti**: The state below the **Antarakaran**, lasting only for **Annamuhurta** (a moment).
2. **Dvitiya Sthiti**: The state above the **Antarakaran**.

At the end of the **Annamuhurta** duration of the **Prathama Sthiti**, or the state below the **Antarakaran**, the...

## Chapter 242

In the future, when a being attains **Samyaktva**, the **utkrista anubhag bandh** of its **udyot prakriti** occurs. This is because the **udyot prakriti** is auspicious and its **utkrista anubhag bandh** occurs only from pure results. Among those who bind it, the **naraka** of the seventh hell is the one with the most pure result. Because in other gatis, when there is such purity, the **utkrista anubhag bandh** of **prakritis** suitable for the **manushya gati** or **deva gati** occurs. The **udyot prakriti** is among the **prakritis** suitable for the **tiryanch gati**, and the **naraka** of the seventh hell, upon death, is born in the **tiryanch** according to the rules. This is why the **naraka** of the seventh hell binds **karma** suitable for the **tiryanch gati** in every moment of **mithyatva**.

The **utkrista anubhag bandh** of the five **prakritis** - **manushyadvik**, **oudarikadvik**, and **vajrishabhanaracha sanhanan** - is attributed to the **samyagdristi devas**. Although these five **prakritis** can also have their **utkrista anubhag bandh** from pure results, they do not attain such purity due to suffering in hell. They also do not receive the materials that purify the results like the vision of the **tirthankaras**' glory, listening to their teachings, and paying homage, which are available to the **devas**. This is why the **narakas** are not considered. The **tiryanch** and **manushya**, being of the most pure results, bind only the **prakritis** suitable for the **deva gati**. This is why the **utkrista anubhag bandh** of these **prakritis** is attributed to the **samyagdristi devas**.

The **utkrista anubhag bandh** of the **devaayu** is attributed to the **aprammat muni**. Since we are discussing the attribution of **utkrista anubhag bandh**, those who bind the **devaayu** are the most pure, being **mithyadristi**, **avirata samyagdristi**, **deshaviriti**, etc.

Thus, the masters of the superior section bondage of 42 auspicious karmas and 14 inauspicious karmas have been separately explained. The masters of the superior section bondage of the remaining 68 karmas have been explained for the composite resultant Mithyatva Jivas of all four gatis - "Chaugayimiccha use saanam."

Having explained the masters of the superior section bondage of all the bondable karmas, now we explain the masters of their inferior section bondage.

"Thiti amichcha madarasam sanjamummuho minchho. Vitiyakasay aviray ves pamalo araisoe." ||66||

Word meaning - Thitirg - Sthyanaddhitrik, Amilch - Anantanuthrandhi Kashaya and Mithyatva Modaniya, Pasar - Naghanya anubhag bandh, Sanjamummuho - Samyaktva Charitra ke abhimukh, Michyo - Mithyadristi, Vipatiyakatay - Second and third Kashaya, Aviray - Avirat Samyagdristi, Des - Deshaviriti, Pamato - Pramattavirat, Araisoe - Arati and Shok Mohaniya.

1. Here, the superior section bondable of 68 karmas for the three Kashayavant Mithyatva Jivas of all four gatis have been explained. It should be understood that, except for Hasya, Rali, Strived, Purushved, the first and the last, the remaining 56 karmas, except for Sanhanan and Sansthan, have superior section bondage for the three Kashayee Mithyadristi of all four gatis. And the said twelve karmas have superior section bondage for the Jivas present in the respective Samvelesh of that particular karma. For example, intense Samklesh is required for the Rasabandh of Napusakaved, less for Strived, and even less for Purushved. It should be understood in the same way everywhere.

## Chapter 244

**Verse Meaning:**

The **Sthāna-dvitriya**, **Ananta-anubandhi** **Kaṣāya** and **Mithyātva** along with **Samyaktva** (Right Faith) lead to the attainment of **Cāritra** (Conduct).  The **Mithyādṛṣṭi** (False Faith) binds **Jighanya-anubhāga-bandha** (Minor Karma-Bonding) towards **Cāritra**.  The **Avirata-samyagdṛṣṭi** (Unwavering Right Faith) binds the second **Kaṣāya** towards **Deśa-virati** (Non-attachment to the World) **Cāritra**.  The **Deśa-virati** binds the third **Kaṣāya** towards **Sarva-virati** (Non-attachment to Everything) **Cāritra**.  The **Pramatta-samyata** (Careless Restraint) binds the **Arati** (Dislike) and **Śoka** (Sorrow) **Mohaniya** (Attractive) **Jighanya-anubhāga-bandha**.

**Special Meaning:**

This verse begins by describing the **Jighanya-anubhāga-bandha** of those who possess **Jighanya-anubhāga-bandha** by contrasting them with those who possess **Utkṛṣṭa-anubhāga-bandha** (Superior Karma-Bonding).

Previously, it was explained that **Jighanya-anubhāga-bandha** of **Aśubha-prakṛti** (Unwholesome Nature) arises from **Viśuddha-pariṇāma** (Pure Results) and **Jighanya-anubhāga-bandha** of **Śubha-prakṛti** (Wholesome Nature) arises from **Saṁkleśa-pariṇāma** (Impure Results).  The **Prakṛti** mentioned in this verse are all **Aśubha-prakṛti**.  Therefore, the verse uses the term "**Ho**" (possessing) to describe those who bind these **Prakṛti**.  The term "**Saṁjamummuh**" (one who is about to attain restraint) is applied to each **Prakṛti**.  This means that the **Jīva** who is about to attain restraint in the next moment, will bind the **Jighanya-anubhāga-bandha** of that **Prakṛti** in the final moment of their **Guṇasthāna** (State of Being).  The term "**Saṁjamummuh**" should be understood in conjunction with each **Guṇasthāna**.  This means that the **Mithyādṛṣṭi** **Jīva** who is about to attain **Samyaktva** (Right Faith) will bind the **Jighanya-anubhāga-bandha** of **Sthāna-dvitriya**, **Anubandhi** **Kaṣāya**, and **Mithyātva** **Mohaniya** in the final moment of their **Guṇasthāna**.

A being in the fourth *guna-sthana* (stage of spiritual development), who is headed towards the *shataka* (a state of liberation), experiences the binding of the subtlest aspects of the four *kṣayās* (afflictions) at the end of the fourth *guna-sthana*. This binding of the subtlest aspects of the four *kṣayās* leads to the transition from the fifth *guna-sthana* to the sixth *guna-sthana*. Similarly, at the end of the fifth *guna-sthana*, the binding of the subtlest aspects of the two *prakṛtis* (natural tendencies) of *arati* (disgust) and *śoka* (sorrow) leads to the transition from the sixth *guna-sthana* to the seventh *guna-sthana*. In other words, before attaining the next *guna-sthana*, the binding of the subtlest aspects of *sthāna-dṛṣṭi-vik* (attachment to the body) and other *prakṛtis* occurs.

It is important to understand that even if a being does not progress from the first *guna-sthana* to the fourth *guna-sthana* but instead goes to the fifth, sixth, or seventh *guna-sthana*, or if they do not progress from the fourth *guna-sthana* to the fifth but instead go to the sixth or seventh *guna-sthana*, the binding of the subtlest aspects of these *prakṛtis* will still occur. This is because the binding of the subtlest aspects of these *prakṛtis* requires pure *parināmas* (transformations), and in such cases, there are even more pure *parināmas* present. This is why the verse mentions the term "**sanjamummuho**" (those who are inclined towards a particular type of restraint). It means that if a being is inclined towards any type of restraint associated with a particular *guna-sthana*, they will experience the binding of the subtlest aspects of these *prakṛtis*.

Now, we will discuss the binding of the subtlest aspects of other *prakṛtis* in those who are subject to them:

The क्षपक (Kshapaka) who resides in the tenth गुणस्थान (Gunasthan) performs it at the culmination of that गुणस्थान. Because among their binders, this is the most pure.

The मनुष्य (Manushya) and तिर्यंच (Tiryanch) are the masters of the inferior portion of these sixteen प्रकृति (Prakriti) - मूक्ष्मत्रिक (Mookshmatik), विकलत्रिक (Vikalatrik), four आयु (Ayu), and वैक्रियषटक (Vaikriyashatak) (which includes बक्रिय शरीर (Bakriya Sharira), त्रैकिय अंगोपांग (Traikiya Angopang), देवगति (Devagati), देवानुपूर्वी (Devanupurvi), नरकगति (Narakagati), and नरकानुपूर्वी (Narakanupurvi)).  Out of these sixteen प्रकृति, they do not bind fourteen of them from birth as देव (Dev) or नारक (Narak). The inferior portion of मनुष्यायु (Manushyayu) and तिर्यंचायु (Tiryancyayu) is bound along with the inferior स्थितिबंध (Sthitibandh). Because these two are प्रशस्त प्रकृति (Prashasht Prakriti), their inferior portion is bound by संक्लेश परिणाम (Sanklesh Parinam) but the inferior स्थितिबंध is also bound by संक्लेश परिणाम.  

The देव and नारक do not take birth as मनुष्य and तिर्यंच with inferior स्थिति, therefore they do not bind their inferior portion. In other words, the one who binds the inferior स्थितिबंध of these two प्रकृति, also binds their inferior अनुभागबंध (Anubhagbandh). Therefore, the मनुष्य and तिर्यंच are said to be the masters of the inferior अनुभागबंध of these sixteen प्रकृति, including मूक्ष्मत्रिक etc.

The देव and नारक bind the inferior अनुभागबंध of these three प्रकृति - उद्योत (Udyot), औदारिकट्टिक (Audarikatik). It is important to understand that the inferior अनुभागबंध of औदारिक अंगोपांग (Audarik Angopang) is bound by the वैमानिक देव (Vaimanik Dev) who reside above ईशान स्वर्ग (Ishan Swarg). Because the देव who reside up to ईशान स्वर्ग bind the एकेन्द्रिययोग्य (Ekendriyogy) प्रकृति due to उत्कृष्ट संक्लेश (Utkrisht Sanklesh), and एकेन्द्रिय (Ekendriya) do not have अंगोपांग. Therefore, the देव who reside up to ईशान स्वर्ग do not bind the inferior अनुभागबंध of औदारिक अंगोपांग नामकर्म (Audarik Angopang Namakarma).

The मनुष्य and तिर्यंच bind the inferior अनुभागबंध of the aforementioned three प्रकृति...

The reason why there is no bondage of the lowest segment of the three natures is that the beings who bind the natures suitable for the Tiryanch (animal) also bind the lowest segment of these. But humans and Tiryanch bind the natures suitable for hell, as many complex results are required for the bondage of the lowest segment of these three natures. Therefore, humans and Tiryanch are not said to bind the lowest segment of these natures.

**Special Meaning:** The term "tiriduganitamatma" refers to the seven hells, which are the lowest sections of the three natures: *tiryanch* (animal), *tiyanchan* (human), and *neech* (low caste). This is explained as follows: When a being in the seventh hell, while performing the three actions of *yathpravritti* (right action), *adi* (beginning), and *karan* (cause), reaches the final stage of *anivrittikaran* (cessation), they experience the lowest level of bondage of these three natures. These three natures are inauspicious, and only the completely pure soul experiences their lowest level of bondage. Therefore, among those bound by these natures, the being in the seventh hell is considered particularly pure. Because, with such purity, other beings would experience bondage in the human realm or higher castes. This is why the being in the seventh hell is considered to have experienced the lowest level of bondage of the three natures: *tiryanch*, *tiyanchan*, and *neech*.

The lowest level of bondage of the *tirthankara* (liberated soul) nature is experienced by the *avirata samyagdristi* (one who has attained perfect knowledge) being, as described in the *Jinamvirya* text. However, it is important to understand that this is an auspicious nature, and the lowest level of bondage of auspicious natures occurs due to *sanklesha* (attachment). Therefore, when an *avirata samyagdristi* being, who is bound to hell, is about to experience *mithyatva* (false belief), they experience the lowest level of bondage of the *tirthankara* karma. Although the bondage of the *tirthankara* nature occurs from the fourth to the eighth *gunasthan* (stages of spiritual development), the lowest level of bondage of auspicious natures occurs due to *sanklesha*, and this *sanklesha* only occurs in the case of an *avirata samyagdristi* being who is about to experience *mithyatva* while bound to the *tirthankara* nature. This is why the *avirata samyagdristi* human being is considered to experience the lowest level of bondage of the *tirthankara* nature. The *tirthankara* nature does not experience bondage in the *tiryanch* realm, which is why a human being is mentioned here. The human being who, before experiencing the bondage of the *tirthankara* nature...

One who is not bound by the karma of hell does not go to hell. Therefore, the karma of bound hell has been accepted. A soul with a pure vision, even though it may be born in hell after death, cannot be bound by the gross part of the Tirthankara nature due to its purity. Therefore, it has not been accepted here.

The gross part of the karma of the one-sense being and the stationary karma is bound by beings of the three paths: animal, human, and god, except for the hell path. But in relation to these three paths, it is important to know that beings with a medium result of the present and past lives do this. Because both these natures are inauspicious, therefore, beings with a very complex result bind the excellent part of them, and very pure beings bind the five-sense being and the karma of the Tass. Therefore, the medium result has been accepted.

In summary, when a being binds the karma of the one-sense being and the stationary karma, and then binds the karma of the five-sense being and the As karma, and then binds the karma of the one-sense being and the stationary karma again, then this type of being, who binds by changing, is a medium result of the present and past lives, and when it attains its appropriate purity, it binds the gross part of the two natures.

The gross part of the karma of the Attap nature is said to be bound by the gods up to the Ishaan Kalpa. Although the word "Asoum" is used in the verse, which means "up to the Saudharma heaven," both Saudharma and Ishaan heavens exist in the same category, so both should be accepted. This means that the Vaimanik gods of the Bhavnapatis, Vyantars, Jyotishkas, Saudharma, and Ishaan heavens bind the gross part of the Attap nature.

The same gods bind the gross part of the Attap nature...

The reason is that the Ātap nature is auspicious, and the inferior section of auspicious natures is bound by the most subtle results. Therefore, at the time of the binding of the natures suitable for the one-sensed gods, the inferior section of the Ātap nature is bound. If the results suitable for binding the inferior section of the Ātap nature are those of humans and animals, then they bind only the natures suitable for hell, and the gods of the Naraka and Sanatkumara kalpas do not bind this nature from birth. Therefore, it is said that the gods up to the Ishana heaven are bound by it.

The owners of the six sections of binding of the Ārāshis, namely Lātavedaniya, Sthira, Shubha, Yashas-koti, and their opposites Asātavedaniya, Asthira, Abha, and Ayashi, are Sambādha-shti or Mithyādṛishti. For these binders, it should be understood that they have the middle results of Parāvartanam. This is explained below.

The Pramatta Muni binds the inferior state of Asātavedaniya, which is equal to the Koti-Koti-Sāgara, until the end of the moment, and after the end of the moment, he binds Sātavedaniya, and again binds Asātavedaniya. Similarly, the Deshavirata, Avirata Samyagdṛishti, Samyag-Mithyādṛishti, Sāsādan Samyagdṛishti, and Mithyaiṣṭi beings bind Asāta after Sāta, and Sātavedaniya after Asāta. Among these, the Mithyādṛishti being binds Asāta after Sāta, and Sāta after Asāta, until the state of Sātavedaniya is equal to fifteen Koti-Koti-Sāgaras. After that, if there are more subtle results, he binds only Asāta until his superior state is equal to thirty Koti-Koti-Sāgaras. From the Pramatta Samvat onwards, in the Gunasthānas of Apramāna, Nayata, etc., the being binds only Sātavedaniya. 

Page #291:
---------------------------
The essence is that the gross sections of the seven vedaniya, which are worthy of bondage, are found in the fifteen kodakodī sāgara states of bondage of the seven vedaniya, from the middle result of the paravarttamāna, to the gross sthini-bandha of the antah-kodakodī sāgara pramaṇa of the asāta-vedaniya in the sixth guna-sthāna. The paravarttamāna results can be obtained as long as there is bondage of the opposing nature. That is, as long as there are paravarttamāna results, bondage of the asāta-vedaniya along with the sāta is possible. But the results that occur from the excellent sthiti-bandha of the sāta-vedaniya onwards are so complex that only the asāta-vedaniya can be bound by them. Therefore, the gross sections of the sāta and asāta-vedaniya are said to be the owners of the paravarttamāna middle result, of the samyagdṛṣṭi and mithyaiṣṭi beings. The excellent state of the twenty kodakodī sāgara of the unstable, inauspicious, and infamous, and the excellent state of the ten kodakodī sāgara of the stable, auspicious, and famous, are said to be. The pramatta muni binds the gross state of the antah-kodakodī sāgara pramaṇa of the unstable, inauspicious, and infamous, and due to purification, then binds their opposing stable, auspicious, and famous. After that, he again binds the unstable, etc. Similarly, the deśaviraṭi, aviraṭ samyagdṛṣṭi, minadṛṣṭi, sāsadana, mithyādṛṣṭi, etc., bind the stable, etc., after the stable, etc., and the unstable, etc., after the unstable, etc. Of these, the mithyādṛṣṭi binds these natures in the aforementioned manner until the excellent sthiti-bandha of the stable, etc., occurs. In these sthiti-bandhas, which are worthy of the samyagdṛṣṭi and mithyaiṣṭi, the gross section of the aforementioned natures is bound.

After that, there is only the binding of the unstable, etc., and in the qualities of non-distraction, etc., there is only the binding of the stable, etc. In the wrong view, there is an abundance of the results of the complexes, and in non-distraction, there is an abundance of pure results. Therefore, in both, there is a large amount of section binding. Therefore, except for these two, in the remaining places mentioned, there is a minor section binding of the six natures, unstable, etc.

* **Sas-uchchvas:** Name of the breath,
* **Par-ghuchch:** Name of the blow and high lineage,
* **Sangh-yan-agi-h:** Six types of cohesion and six types of abode,
* **Ma-putthi:** Eunuch, female,
* **Su-ma-gi-arati:** Auspicious triad and other inauspicious triad,
* **Min-t:** Wrong view,
* **Ghaj-gai-ya:** Four types of beings.

**Commentary:**

Four types of existence, four types of color, four types of radiance, two types of human beings, two types of liberation, five-sense beings, breath, blow, high lineage, six types of cohesion, six types of abode, eunuch, female, auspicious triad, inauspicious triad, and four types of beings with wrong view, all these forty natures bind with minor section binding.

**Special Meaning:**

The verse mentions forty natures and explains that they bind with minor section binding in beings of all four types with wrong view. Some of these natures are auspicious and some are inauspicious.

Four types of existence (existence, non-existence, sufficient, each), four types of color (auspicious color, smell, taste, touch), four types of radiance (radiance, karmic, heavy-light, creation), five-sense beings, breath, and blow, these fifteen natures are auspicious, therefore...

## Chapter 256

This section deals with the **Jghanya Anubhag Bandha** (binding of the lowest aspect) of the **15 Karmas**.

**Mithyatva** (false belief) humans and **Tiryancha** (animals) bind the lowest aspect of these 15 Karmas when they bind the **Narkagati** (hell) worthy **Prakritis** (nature).

When **Devas** (gods) above **Ishaan Svarga** (heaven) and **Naraka** (hell) beings bind the **Panchendriya** (five senses) **Tiryancha** worthy **Prakritis**, they also bind the lowest aspect of these 15 Karmas.

Similarly, when Devas up to Ishaan Svarga bind the **Ekendriya** (one sense) worthy **Prakritis**, they bind the lowest aspect of these 15 Karmas, except for the **Panchendriya Jati** (five sense birth) and **Vas** (attachment) **Karmas**.

In summary, **Mithyatva** humans and **Tiryancha** bind the lowest aspect of the 15 Karmas, including **Asachatuska** (fourfold false belief), when they bind the **Narkagati** worthy **Prakritis**. Devas above Ishaan Svarga and Naraka beings bind the lowest aspect of these 15 Karmas when they bind the **Panchendriya Tiryancha** worthy **Prakritis**. Devas up to Ishaan Svarga bind the lowest aspect of these 15 Karmas, except for **Panchendriya Jati** and **Vas**, when they bind the **Ekendriya** worthy **Prakritis**.

The reason why Devas up to Ishaan Svarga do not bind the lowest aspect of **Panchendriya Jati** and **As** (non-virtuous) **Karma** is that these two **Karmas** are bound only in the **Vishuddha** (pure) state. Therefore, the lowest aspect of these two **Prakritis** is not bound.

**Stri Ved** (female karma) and **Napumsak Ved** (neuter karma) are both **Aprashasht** (unrefined) **Prakritis**. The lowest aspect of these two **Prakritis** is bound by **Mithyatva** beings who have **Vishuddha** (pure) **Parinaama** (result).

**Manushyadhik** (human-like), **Bajra** (thunderbolt), **Rishabhanaraaj** (king of the bulls), **Sanhanan** (accumulation), and other six **Sanhanan** (accumulation) **Karmas**, **Samachaturasra** (square) **Sansthan** (structure), and other six **Sansthan** (structure) **Karmas**, **Shubha** (auspicious) and **Ashubha** (inauspicious) **Vihaayogati** (path of liberation), **Subhagatrik** (auspicious, melodious, and desirable) and **Durbhagatrik** (inauspicious, discordant, and undesirable) **Karmas** are all bound by **Mithyatva** beings.

**The ignorant section of the lower category of the noble lineage, bound by karma, are the beings of the four states with false vision, but they are of medium results.**

This is because the beings with right vision bind the lower category of the animal and human states, but not the lower category of the human state. Among the institutions, they bind the square institution, but not the cohesive institution. They bind the auspicious birth, good fortune, good voice, wealth, and noble lineage, but they bind the inauspicious, broken, etc.

**The beings with right vision, both gods and hell beings, bind the lower category of the human state, but not the lower category of the animal state.** Among the institutions, they bind the square institution, and among the circles, they bind the Vajra-Rishabha-Naracha cohesive institution. They bind the auspicious birth, good fortune, etc., but not their opposite natures. This prevents the binding of their opposite natures, and the non-binding of these prevents the change in results. The lack of change keeps the results pure, preventing the binding of the lower category of the noble natures. This is why the ignorant section is bound, not the section with right vision.

**The lower category of the human state is compared to the excellent state of fifteen Koḍakoḍī oceans, and the auspicious birth, good fortune, good voice, wealth, noble lineage, first cohesive institution, and first institution are compared to the excellent state of ten Koḍakoḍī oceans.** The binding of the lower category of these auspicious natures begins from their respective excellent states and extends to the binding of their lower states, which are compared to the state of the inner Koḍakoḍī oceans, along with their opposite natures, through the medium results that are reflected in between. This binding occurs through the reflection of the inner moments. The binding of the lower category of the Vāmana institution and the Kolika cohesive institution occurs in sequence with the Huṇḍa institution and the Sewārt cohesive institution.

When there is a reflection up to the state of the century. Similarly, one should know when there is a reflection up to the lowest state of the remaining Sanhanan, the possible remaining Sanhanan of the institution, and the institution itself. In these states, Mithyadrishti reflects the lowest section of the bond from the medium result. Similarly, one should understand for other natures. Thus, after stating the owners of the superior and inferior sections of the bondable natures, we now consider the breaking of the section bonds in the original and subsequent natures.

## The Fifth Karma Granthya

**256**

**Verse:** The four types of *Tanjas* are *Chaturja*, *Chatushka*, *Deddi*, and *Kai Aur*. The *Namkarma* has the *Anutkrusht* section of *Bandha*, and the rest of the *Dhruvbandhini* and *Ghati* natures have the *Ajghanya* section of *Bandha*. The *Gotrakarma* has both *Anutkrusht* and *Ajghanya* types of *Bandha*, making a total of four types.

The remaining sections of *Bandha* for the aforementioned natures, and all the *Bandha* for the rest of the remaining natures, are of two types.

**Explanation:** This verse discusses the divisions of *Bandha* in the *Mool* and *Uttar* natures. There are four types of *Bandha*: *Utkrusht*, *Anutkrusht*, *Jghanya*, and *Ajghanya*. Among these, the *Jghanya* refers to the least section of *Karma* power, and the *Ajghanya* refers to the divisions from one indivisible part above the *Jghanya* section power to the most *Utkrusht* section. Within these *Jghanya* and *Ajghanya* divisions, there are infinite divisions of the section.

The *Utkrusht* refers to the highest section power, and the *Anutkrusht* refers to the divisions from one indivisible part less than the *Utkrusht* power to the *Sarvajghanya* section. Thus, within the *Utkrusht* and *Anutkrusht* divisions, all the divisions of section power are contained. This can be understood with an example: Imagine the *Sarvajghanya* has a value of 1 and the *Utkrusht* has a value of 16. Then, 8 would be considered *Jghanya*, and the divisions from 9 to 16 would be considered *Ajghanya*. 16 would be considered *Utkrusht*, and the divisions from 15 to 8 would be considered *Anutkrusht*. These divisions are considered in the *Mool* and *Uttar* natures along with the *Sadi*, *Anadi*, *Dhruv*, and *Adhruv* divisions.

The details of the sorrows mentioned in the previous verse are as follows: The four Tejas (Tanjas, Karman, Agurulghu, Nirman) and the four Varna (color, smell, taste, and touch - here, one should understand the auspicious Varna Chatushk), the non-painful karma and the name karma, the inferior section of the bandh (binding) is of four types: Saadi, Anaadi, Dhruva, and Adhruva. 

Here's the explanation: The superior section of the eight Prakruti (Tejas Chatushk and auspicious Varna Chatushk) binds during the liberation of the thirty Prakruti, which is capable of being understood in the Kshapak, Apurvakaran, Gunasthan. Apart from this, the inferior binding of these Prakruti occurs in other places like Upsham, Anni, etc. However, there is no binding at all in the eleventh Gunasthan. When someone falls from the eleventh Gunasthan and again binds the inferior section of these Prakruti, it is called Saadi. The binding before attaining this state is called Anaadi, as it has been happening since time immemorial. The binding of a Bhavy Jiva (soul destined for liberation) is Adhruva (non-permanent), and the binding of an Abhavy Jiva (soul not destined for liberation) is Dhruva (permanent). Thus, the inferior section of the eight Prakruti binds in four ways: Saadi, Anaadi, Dhruva, and Adhruva.

However, the remaining superior, inferior, and non-inferior sections of the bandh have only two types of binding: Saadi and Adhruva. As mentioned earlier, the superior section of the Tejas Chatushk and Varna Chatushk binds in the Kshapak, Apurvakaran, Gunasthan, which does not happen before. Therefore, it is Saadi, and since it happens only once and not again, it is Adhruva. These Prakruti are auspicious, so their inferior section of the bandh is done by the Jiva who has the superior Sanklesh (complexities), sufficient Sanshi (doubt), five senses, Mithyadrishti (false perception), and Jeeva (soul). This Jiva binds in the non-inferior section after a minimum of one time and a maximum of two times. Later, when the superior Sanklesh arises...

## The Fifth Karma Granth

It again binds their inferior section. Thus, the inferior and non-inferior section binding is both *sadi* and *adhruva*.

There are four types of binding of the inferior section of *vedaniya* and *namakarma*, namely *sadi*, *adi*, etc. Because, compared to *vedaniya* and *yashakoti* *namakarma*, the superior section binding of *vedaniya* and *namakarma* occurs only in the tenth *gunasthan* called *kshapka sukshmasampray*, and in the remaining *gunasthanas*, the inferior binding occurs. In the eleventh *gunasthan*, their binding does not occur. Therefore, the inferior section binding that occurs after being expelled from the eleventh *gunasthan* is *sadi* and the one before it is *anadi*. The binding of a *bhavya* being is *dhruva* and that of an *abhavya* being is *adhruva*. Thus, there are four types of inferior section binding of *vedaniya* and *namakarma*, namely *sadi*, *adi*, etc.

Except for the inferior binding of *vedaniya* and *namakarma*, the remaining superior, inferior, and non-inferior bindings are both *sadi* and *adhruva*. The superior binding occurs only in the *kshapka sukshmasampray* *gunasthan*, not in other *gunasthanas*, hence it is *sadi*, and since it does not occur in the twelfth and subsequent *gunasthanas*, it is *adhruva*. The inferior section binding is done by a *samyagdristi* or a *mithyadristi* being with a medium result. This inferior section binding is *sadi* because it occurs after the non-inferior section binding, and after the inferior binding occurs for a minimum of one time and a maximum of four times, the non-inferior binding occurs again, making the inferior binding *adhruva* and the non-inferior binding *sadi*. After that, in the same *bhava* or in another *bhava*, if the inferior binding occurs again, the non-inferior binding becomes *adhruva*. Thus, the remaining superior, inferior, and non-inferior bindings are both *sadi* and *adhruva*.

Now, about the bindings of *dhruvabandhini* and *adhruvabandhini* natures...

**Shataka**

We consider. Except for the Tejas Chatushk, the remaining Dhruvbandhini Prakṛtis have four types of Ajghanya Bandha. The five Jñānavaranas, four Darśanavaranas, and five Antarāyas, these fourteen Prakṛtis are Ashubha and their Ajghanya Bandha occurs at the end of the Sūkṣmasamprayā Gunasthāna. Their Bandha does not occur in the eleventh Gunasthāna. Therefore, the Bandha that occurs after being expelled from the eleventh Gunasthāna is Sadi, and the Bandha before that is Anadi. The Bandha of a Bhavy is Adhruva, and the Bandha of an Abhavy is Dhruva.

The Ajghanya Bandha of the Sanjvalana Chatushk occurs at the time of their Bandhavicchedha in the Kṣapaka Anivṛttibādar Gunasthāna. Except for this, Ajghanya Bandha occurs everywhere else. Bandha does not occur in the eleventh Gunasthāna, therefore, the Bandha that occurs after being expelled from there is Sadi, the one before that is Anadi, the Bandha of a Bhavy is Adhruva, and the Bandha of an Abhavy is Dhruva.

Nidrā, Prachalā, Ashubha Varṇachatushk, Upadhāt, Bhaya, and Jugupsā have Ajghanya Bandha in all places except for the time of their Bandhavicchedha in the Kṣapaka Apūrvakaraṇa, where they have Ajghanya Bandha for a short time. When they fall into the Upashama श्रेणी, their Ajghanya Bandha occurs again, which is Sadi. Their Bandha before Bandhavicchedha is Anadi, the Bandha of an Abhavy is Dhruva, and the Bandha of a Bhavy is Adhruva.

The Ajghanya Bandha of the Pratyākyānāvarana Kṣaya Chatushk occurs at the end of the Deśavirati Gunasthāna, making it inclined towards Samyama. The Bandha that occurs before that is Ajghanya Bandha. The Ajghanya Bandha of the Apratyākhyānāvarana Kṣaya Chatushk occurs at the end of their Gunasthāna for a Samyagdṛṣṭi Jīva who is desirous of obtaining Kṣayika Samyaktva and Samyama, and who is constantly engaged in Samyagdṛṣṭi.

## The Fifth Karma Granthya

263. Except for this, the *ajghanya* (least intense) section of *bandha* (bondage) occurs everywhere. *Styanadhee*, *nidra-nidra* and *pratraala-prachala*, *mithyatva* and *anantaanbandhee* *kashaya* (passions) create the *jghanya* (most intense) section of *bandha* in the *vishuddha parinaami* (purely transformed) *mithyadristi* (false perception) at the end of its *gunasthan* (state of being), and the rest of the *bandha* is *ajghanya* everywhere. After attaining *samyama* (self-control) etc., and falling from there, the *ajghanya* section of *bandha* occurs again. This *bandha* is *saadi* (eternal) for the *asadi* (non-eternal) and *anaadi* (beginningless) and *abhavya* (non-liberated), and *adhruva* (non-eternal) for the *bhavya* (liberated). Thus, the *ajghanya* section of *bandha* of 43 *dhruva prakriti* (eternal substances) is of four types.

Now, we will explain the two types of *jghanya*, *utkrista* (excellent) and *anutkrista* (inferior) sections of *bandha*. The *jghanya* section of *bandha* of the aforementioned 43 *prakriti* occurs in the *sukshmasampraaya* (subtle state) etc. *gunasthan*, which is *saadi* due to being the first time in those *gunasthan*. It is *adhruva* because it does not occur in the 12th etc. higher *gunasthan*. The *utkrista* section of *bandha* is done by the *paryaptasangni* (fully conscious) *panchendriya* (five-sensed) *mithyadristi* (false perception) being with *utkrista sanklesh* (excellent karmic afflictions), which lasts for one or two times. After that, the *anutkrista* section of *bandha* occurs. Later, when *utkrista sanklesh* occurs again, the *utkrista* section of *bandha* occurs again. Thus, there are only two alternatives in the *utkrista* and *anutkrista* sections of *bandha*: *saadi* and *adhruva*.

Now, we will explain the four sections of *bandha* of the *adhruvabandhini* (non-eternal bondage) *prakriti*. Due to being *adhruvabandhini*, these *prakriti* have two types of *utkrista*, *anutkrista*, *jghanya* and *ajghanya* sections of *bandha*: *saadi* and *adhruva*.

*Jnanaavaran*, *darshanavaran*, *mohniya* and *antaraaya* - these four *ghati karma* (destructive karmas) are *ashubha* (unwholesome). Their *ajghanya* section of *bandha* is of four types.

It is the **jghanya** (inferior) section of **ashubha** (inauspicious) karmas that binds and the **utkrusht** (superior) section of **shubha** (auspicious) karmas that binds to **vishud parinaami** (purely resultant) **bandhak** (bound). **Jnanavaran**, **darshanavaran**, and **antaraya** are **ashubha** (inauspicious), therefore their **jghanya** (inferior) section binding occurs at the end of **kshapik sukshmasampray** **mrinaasthan** (subtle subtle-body, the state of death) and the binding of **mohaniya** (obscuring) karma occurs until the ninth **gunasthan** (state of being). Thus, its **jghanya** (inferior) section binding occurs at the end of the ninth **gunasthan** (state of being). Except for these **gunasthanas** (states of being), the **ajghanya** (non-inferior) section binding of all four karmas occurs in the remaining **gunasthanas** (states of being). In the eleventh and tenth **gunasthanas** (states of being), the binding of these four karmas does not occur, but after falling from there, when their **ajghanya** (non-inferior) section binding occurs again, it is **saadi** (beginningless). And for those beings who have never come to the ninth, tenth, etc. **gunasthanas** (states of being), this **ajghanya** (non-inferior) binding is **anaadi** (beginningless). The binding of an **abhavya** (non-liberated being) is **dhruva** (permanent) and the binding of a **bhavya** (liberated being) is **adhruva** (impermanent).

Now, we will clarify the **saadi** (beginningless) and **adhruva** (impermanent) types that occur in the remaining three **jghanya** (inferior), **utkrusht** (superior), and **anutkrusht** (non-superior) section bindings of **ghatikarma** (destructive karmas). The **jghanya** (inferior) section binding of **mohaniya** (obscuring) karma occurs at the end of **kshapik anivrittibhadar** (the state of death of a non-liberated being) and the rest, **jnanavaran**, **darshanavaran**, and **antaraya**, occur at the end of **kshapik sukshmasampray** **gunasthan** (subtle subtle-body, the state of death). This binding occurs only once, therefore it is **saadi** (beginningless) and does not occur when going to the twelfth **gunasthan** (state of being), therefore it is **adhruva** (impermanent). It is not **anaadi** (beginningless) because it never occurs before coming to the aforementioned **gunasthanas** (states of being) and it is not **dhruva** (permanent) because it is not for an **abhavya** (non-liberated being). After the **anutkrusht** (non-superior) binding, the **utkrusht** (superior) binding occurs, therefore it is **saadi** (beginningless) and after one or two times, the **anutkrusht** (non-superior) binding occurs again, therefore the **utkrusht** (superior) binding is **adhruva** (impermanent) and the **anutkrusht** (non-superior) binding is **saadi** (beginningless). After a minimum of **antmuhurt** (the last moment) and a maximum of **ananantanant** (infinitely infinite) **utsarpini** (ascending) and **avsarpiini** (descending) time, when **utkrusht** (superior) **sanklesh** (affliction) occurs, the **utkrusht** (superior) binding occurs again.

## The Fifth Karma Granth
### 265

The **utkrusht** (excellent) and **anutkrusht** (inferior) **bandh** (bond) are **madhyam** (intermediate) and **adhruv** (impermanent) because they keep changing.

In **gotra karma** (family karma), there are four types of **ajghannya** (non-inferior) and **anutkrusht** (inferior) **bandh**, and two types of **jghannya** (inferior) and **utkrusht** (excellent) **bandh**. The **salka** (shell) and **anutkrusht** (inferior) **anubhag bandh** (section bond) should be understood as similar to **vedaniya** (painful) and **naam** (name) **karma**.

Now, let's consider **jghannya** (inferior) and **ajghannya** (non-inferior) **bandh**. When a being in the seventh hell, facing **samyaktv** (right faith), performs the **yathpravritt** (natural) **adi** (initial) three **karan** (causes), they experience **mithyatva** (false belief) in **anivrittikaran** (cessation). This leads to the **mithyatva** (false belief) state, which can be either **bha** (being) or **bhaale** (becoming). One is the **antmuhurt** (last moment) **praman** (evidence) state, and the other is the **shresh** (remaining) state.

Experiencing the lower state, at the end of the **antmuhurt** (last moment) **praman** (evidence) state, a **jghannya** (inferior) **anubhag bandh** (section bond) of **gotra karma** (family karma) occurs, compared to the **neech gotra** (lower family). In another place, if there is such purity, then an **ajghannya** (non-inferior) **anubhag bandh** (section bond) of a higher **gotra** (family) occurs.

Since the **neech gotra** (lower family) **bandh** occurs in the **mithyatva** (false belief) state in the seventh hell, it is accepted. The **narak** (hell being) who is not facing **samyaktv** (right faith) with **mithya drishti** (false vision) has an **ajghannya** (non-inferior) **anubhag bandh** (section bond) of the **neech gotra** (lower family), and upon attaining **samyaktv** (right faith), they have an **ajghannya** (non-inferior) **anubhag bandh** (section bond) of the higher **gotra** (family).

This **jghannya** (inferior) **anubhag bandh** (section bond) of the **neech gotra** (lower family) is not possible elsewhere and is **sadi** (beginningless) because it happens for the first time in that state. Upon attaining **samyaktv** (right faith), the same being experiences an **ajghannya** (non-inferior) **anubhag bandh** (section bond) of the **neech gotra** (lower family) compared to the higher **gotra** (family). Therefore, the **jghannya** (inferior) **anubhag bandh** (section bond) is **adhruv** (impermanent), and the **ajghannya** (non-inferior) **anubhag bandh** (section bond) is **sadi** (beginningless). The **ajghannya** (non-inferior) **anubhag bandh** (section bond) that occurs before is **anadi** (beginningless).

The **ajghannya** (non-inferior) **bandh** (bond) of an **abhavya** (non-liberated) is **dhruv** (permanent), and that of a **bhavya** (liberated) is **adhruv** (impermanent).

Thus, one should know the two options of **jghannya** (inferior) **anubhag bandh** (section bond) and the four options of **ajghannya** (non-inferior) **anubhag bandh** (section bond) in **gotra karma** (family karma).

**Fatal**
_In the heinous, extremely severe, and moderate sections of the _āyukkarma_, there are only two options: _sādi_ and _adhruva_. Because the binding of _āyukkarma_ occurs only in the division of the _bhupayamāna_ lifespan, its heinous, etc., forms are bound in the sections, etc., and after the final moment, that binding necessarily ceases, making it _adhruva_. Thus, one should understand the _sādi_ and _adhruva_ types of the heinous, etc., sections of _āyukkarma_ bindings.

In this way, one should know the _sādi_, etc., types of the dissolution of the excellent, etc., section bindings in the original and subsequent natures. After describing the section binding, we now begin the discussion of the _pradeśabandh_. At the beginning of _pradeśabandh_, we first describe the _vargaṇās_. _Praveśabandh_
... _igaduganugaī jā abhavaṇantaguṇiānū. khaṅghā uralodhiyavaggaṇā u tah aghaṇantarīyā. ||75||_

**Word meanings:** _igaduganugaī_ - one-atomic, two-atomic, etc., _jā yāvat_ - up to, _gak anavaṇatāṇiā_ - having infinite atoms in the _abhadya_, _khaṅghā_ - _f_, _uralodhiyavaggaṇā_ - _vargaṇā_ suitable for the generous, _tah_ - thus, _aghaṇantarīyā_ - _vargaṇā_ unsuitable for the _praṇayoga_.

**Verse meaning:** From one-atomic, two-atomic, etc., up to the _abhadya_ beings, only those _skandhas_ having infinite atoms are suitable for the generous.

**Go.** In the _karmakāṇḍa_, the _sādi_, etc., types of the heinous, non-heinous, etc., sections of _anubhāga bandh_ are discussed in two verses. One in relation to the original natures, and the other in relation to the subsequent natures. This view is similar to the _karmagrantha_. See the verses in the appendix.

## The Fifth Firm Text

**Grahanayogya (Acceptable) and Agrahanayogya (Unacceptable) Varganas**

There are Grahanayogya Varganas which are acceptable, and Agrahanayogya Varganas which are unacceptable, differing from the Grahanayogya Varganas by the addition of one atom (F-atom).

**Explanation:** This world is filled with Lokaparamanu (world atoms) and Skandha-shaped Pudgalas (matter particles). The Pudgalakaya (matter body) is divided into many Varganas (categories), including a Karma Varga (category of karma). These Varganas, due to the influence of the Yoga (union) of Narmama (subtle body) and Kashaya (passions), transform into Karma-rupa (karma form). The space occupied by one atom of Pudgala is called a Pradesh (region). Therefore, the quantity of Pudgala Skandhas transformed into Karma-rupa is measured by the number of atoms. This is called Pradeshbandha (binding of regions). Therefore, to understand Pradeshbandha, it is necessary to understand Karma Vargana. To understand Karma Vargana, it is necessary to understand the previous Varganas like Audarik (material) etc. Therefore, the nature of these Varganas should also be understood. For this reason, the nature of Audarik etc. Varganas is explained here.

These Audarik etc. Varganas are of two types: Grahanayogya (acceptable) and Agrahanayogya (unacceptable). Starting with Agrahanayogya Vargana, the nature of Varganas up to Karma Vargana is explained in the verse.

A group of Pudgalas of the same type is called a Vargana. These Varganas are...

1. In the commentary of the Karma Grantha (text on karma), a group of Skandhas of the same type is called a Vargana.

However, in the commentary of Karma Prakriti (nature of karma), Skandha and Vargana are considered synonymous. Because the space occupied by Skandha-Vargana is an infinitesimal part of an angul (finger). If a group of Skandhas of the same type is called a Vargana, then its world...

## Chapter 26

The **Shataka** is infinite. Just as there are some **Samasloka** atoms in a **Kapi** (a type of space), they are called the **first Vargana**. The **Skandhas** formed by the combination of two **Pradeshas** are called the **second Vargana**, and the **Skandhas** formed by the combination of three **Pradeshas** are called the **third Vargana**. In the same way, the **Skandhas** with a countable number of **Pradeshas** are called **Sankhyatana Vargana**, the **Skandhas** with an uncountable number of **Pradeshas** are called **Asankhyatana Vargana**, the **Skandhas** with an infinite number of **Pradeshas** are called **Anantana Vargana**, and the **Skandhas** with an infinite number of infinite **Pradeshas** are called **Anantanantana Vargana**.

These **Varganas** are of two types: **Agrahanayoga** (ungraspable) and **Grahanayoga** (graspable). The **Varganas** that are not grasped by the **Jiva** due to their small number of atoms are called **Agrahanavargana**. The **Skandhas** made up of atoms equal to the **Abhyabhy** **Jivas** multiplied by infinity and the **Skandhas** made up of atoms equal to the **Sidha** **Jivas** divided by infinity are graspable by the **Jiva** and they result in the **Audarik** body. Therefore, they are called **Audarik Vargana**. However, this **Vargana** is the most insignificant among the graspable **Varganas** of the **Audarik** body. Above it, the **Skandhas** with one more atom are called the first, second, third, etc., infinite **Varganas** that are graspable by the **Audarik** body. Thus, the graspable **Varganas** of the **Audarik** body are infinite from the most insignificant **Vargana**.

If it is understood through **Dhyana** (meditation), then its understanding will be according to the **Loka** (world). Where **Vargana** and **Skandha** are used synonymously, there is no objection regarding understanding. But where the group of **Skandhas** of the same type is called **Vargana**, if the understanding is taken as **Skandha**, then it becomes uniform. Therefore, according to the commentary on the **Karmagrantha**, the understanding should be taken as **Skandha** but not as **Vargana**.

The finest gradation of the Audarik body, which is capable of being grasped, is one that is a fraction of an infinite number of atoms. In this infinite fraction, there are infinite atoms. Therefore, one should know that there are infinite gradations from the coarsest to the finest gradation of the Audarik body, which are capable of being grasped.

Above the finest gradation of the Audarik body, there are gradations that are formed by adding one atom at a time to the previous gradation. These gradations are more extensive and subtle than the Audarik body, and therefore are not capable of being grasped by the Audarik body. They are also less extensive and coarser than the gradations that form the Vaikriya body, and therefore are not capable of being grasped by the Vaikriya body. In this way, there are infinite ungraspable gradations above the finest gradation of the Audarik body, which are formed by adding one atom at a time to the previous gradation. Just as the finest gradation of the Audarik body is an infinite fraction greater than the coarsest gradation of the Audarik body, so too is the finest ungraspable gradation an infinite fraction greater than the coarsest ungraspable gradation. The measure of this multiplier is an infinite fraction of the Abhtrya quantity and an infinite part of the Siddha quantity.

Above these ungraspable gradations, there are again graspable gradations, and above the graspable gradations, there are ungraspable gradations! In this way, these two types of gradations are distinct from each other.

In this way, after describing the graspable and ungraspable gradations of the Audarik body, the graspable and ungraspable gradations of the Vaikriya, etc., are explained.

## Sarada

The eight limbs of the body, the nine senses, the two pairs, the sixteen actions, the Udyot, the Gotra, the Vedaniya, the five Nidra, the Vamvishak and the four Aam are the **Pāravarttamāna** (transmigratory) natures. The four Aam are **Kshetravipāki** (field-resultant). The **Gāthā** (verse) specifically mentions the **Pāravarttamāna** and **Kshetravipāki** natures.

The **Pāravarttamāna** natures are called so because they prevent the binding, arising, or binding-arising of the **Dūmari** (transmigratory) natures, and instead bind, arise, or bind-arise themselves. These include the **Aghati** (non-fatal) **Vedaniya** (sensory), **Āyu** (life-span), **Nāma** (name), and **Gona** (gender) karmas, along with the **Ghāti** (fatal) karmas **Darshanāvarana** (obscuration of perception), and **Mohaniya** (delusive). These are further categorized as follows:

(1) **Darshanāvarana**: **Nidrā** (sleep), **Nidrā-Nidrā**, **Prachalā**, **Prachalā-Prachalā**, **Snyānaddhi**.

(2) **Varnoya**: **Sāta Vedaniya** (seven sensory), **Asāta Vedaniya** (non-sensory).

(3) **Mohaniya**: **Anantānubandhi Kapāya Chatushk** (fourfold attachment to the infinite), **Apratyaкhyānāvarana Kapāya Chatushk** (fourfold attachment to the non-rejection of obscuration), **Pratyaкhyānāvarana Kapāya Chatushk** (fourfold attachment to the rejection of obscuration), **Mangvalan Kapāya Chatushk** (fourfold attachment to the auspicious), **Hāsya** (laughter), **Rati** (love), **Shoka** (sorrow), **Arati** (disgust), **Strī** (female), **Purusha** (male), **Napumsaka** (neuter) **Ved** (sense).

(4) **Āyakarma**: **Naraka** (hell), **Tithanch** (animal), **Manushya** (human), **Dev** (god) **Ādhū** (state).

(5) **Nāmakarma**: The 33 natures of the **Sharīragashtka** (eight limbs of the body) (**Audārika** (physical), **Vaikriya** (mental), **Āhārak** (food-consuming) body, **Audārika** (physical) **Angopānga** (limbs), **Nīn** (nine) **Angopānga** (limbs), six **Sansthāna** (establishments), six **Mahanan** (greatnesses), **Ekendiya** (one-sense) etc. **Racha** (form), **Jāti** (birth), **Narakagani** (hell-group) etc. four **Gani** (groups), **Shubha-Ashubha** (auspicious-inauspicious) **Bihayogati** (state of separation), four **Ānupuर्वī** (preceding), **Ātap** (heat), **Udyon** (effort), **Nama** (name) **Dashak** (ten), **Sthāvara** (stationary) **Dashak** (ten).

(E) **Gotrakarma**: **Uchna Gotra** (high lineage), **Nīcha Gotra** (low lineage).

## The Fifth Karma Granth

Thus, 5+2+23+4+5+2-1  natures are pervading. Out of these, the sixteen Kapāyas starting with Anantānubandhi Kapāya Chatushk and the five Nidrāyas, being Dhruvabandhini, do not obstruct the two remaining natures in the nine Bandhadashas, but they manifest in the Udayakāla by obstructing the Majaniy nature. This is because in anger, pride, deceit, and greed, only one Kapāya can manifest in a Jiva at a time. Similarly, when one of the five Nidrāyas manifests, the other four Nidrāyas do not manifest. 

The four natures - Stable, Auspicious, Unstable, and Inauspicious - are not antagonistic in the Udayadashā, but they are antagonistic in the Bandhadashā. This is because Stable cannot bind with Unstable, and Auspicious cannot bind with Inauspicious. Therefore, these four natures are pervading. The remaining 66 natures are pervading because they are antagonistic in both the Bandhadashā and the Udayadashā.

Thus, the description of the pervading Karma Natures, along with the twelve categories starting with Dhruvabandhi and ending with Aparavartman, as mentioned by the Granthakāra, has been discussed. Their details can be found in the bracket on page 72.

Now, we will discuss the Karma Natures in relation to Vipaka.

Vipaka refers to the manifestation of the result. The power of a Karma Nature to produce specific or diverse types of fruits, and the state of being ready to bear fruit, is called Vipaka. For example, when mangoes, etc., are ripe and ready to be eaten, they are said to be in Vipaka. Similarly, when Karma Natures are ready to bear their fruits, they are said to be in Vipaka Kāla.

##  Chapter 22: The Subtle Forms of the Soul

As the soul progresses through its 22 stages of existence, its subtle forms become increasingly refined.

The **Audārika** (physical) body, composed of **Audārika** (physical) **Skandhas**, is made up of countless **Paramanus** (atoms).  These **Paramanus** are arranged in an ascending order of subtlety, with each **Skandha** containing an infinite number of **Paramanus** more than the previous one. This is why, despite the **Audārika** body being composed of a relatively small number of **Paramanus**, it is visible, while the **Taijasa** (luminous) and **Kārmaṇa** (karmic) bodies, which are composed of a far greater number of **Paramanus**, remain invisible.

The **Taijasa** body is followed by the **Bhāṣā** (speech), **Śvāsośvāsa** (breath), and **Mano** (mind) **Skandhas**, culminating in the **Kārmaṇa** body. This order reflects the increasing subtlety of these **Skandhas**. The **Bhāṣā** **Skandha**, which governs speech, is more subtle than the **Taijasa** body. The **Śvāsośvāsa** **Skandha**, which governs breath, is more subtle than the **Bhāṣā** **Skandha**. The **Mano** **Skandha**, which governs the mind, is more subtle than the **Śvāsośvāsa** **Skandha**. And finally, the **Kārmaṇa** **Skandha**, which governs karma, is the most subtle of all.

This demonstrates that while these **Skandhas** are incredibly subtle, they are also composed of a vast number of **Paramanus**.

The **Audārika** body's **Skandhas** are divided into **Grahaṇayoga** (perceptible) and **Agrahaṇayoga** (imperceptible) categories. The **Grahaṇayoga** **Skandhas** were discussed in the previous chapter. Here, we will discuss the **Grahaṇayoga** and **Agrahaṇayoga** **Skandhas** of the **Vaikriya** (subtle) body.

The **Agrahaṇayoga** **Skandhas** of the **Audārika** body are composed of a greater number of **Paramanus** than the **Grahaṇayoga** **Skandhas**. The **Vaikriya** body's **Grahaṇayoga** **Skandhas** are composed of a greater number of **Paramanus** than the **Agrahaṇayoga** **Skandhas** of the **Audārika** body.

The **param paramanu** is the smallest possible particle that can be perceived by the **vaikriya** body. Similarly, an infinite number of **varganas** (classifications) of **skandhas** (aggregates) are perceivable by the **vaikriya** body, each one larger than the last.

The **vargana** that is one **pradesh** (dimension) larger than the largest **vargana** perceivable by the **vaikriya** body is too large for the **vaikriya** body but too small for the **aaharaka** body. This **vargana** is called the **agrahanavargna** (imperceptible **vargana**). This is the smallest **agrahanavargna**. There are an infinite number of **agrahanavargna** **varganas**, each one larger than the last.

Above it, with each increasing province, the infinite number of provinces with more provinces than the inferior classification, which is almost suitable for the Tejas body, become the superior classification. From the province of the superior classification, which is suitable for the Jam body, the provinces with one more province become the inferior, unsuitable classification. And above it, with each increasing province, the infinite number of provinces with more provinces than the inferior, unsuitable classification become the superior, unsuitable classification. These infinite unsuitable classifications are unsuitable for the Tejas body because they are much larger in provinces and more subtle than the language, and coarser and smaller in provinces than the language.

The classification with one more province than the aforementioned superior, unsuitable classification is the inferior classification suitable for language. And above it, with each increasing province, the infinite number of provinces with more provinces than the inferior classification become the superior classification suitable for language. In this way, the infinite classifications are suitable for language.

From the province of the superior classification suitable for language, the provinces with one more province become the inferior, unsuitable classification. And above it, with each increasing province, the infinite number of provinces with more provinces than the inferior classification become the superior, unsuitable classification.

In this classification, the provinces with one more province become the inferior classification suitable for breathing.

Above the **utkṛṣṭa** (excellent) **agrahaṇayoga** (non-grasping) **vargaṇā** (category) with an infinite number of **pradeśa** (regions) in its **skandha** (section), there is a **jighnya** (inferior) **vargaṇā** with one more **pradeśa** than the **skandha** of the **utkṛṣṭa** **agrahaṇayoga** **vargaṇā**. Above this **jighnya** **vargaṇā**, there is an **utkṛṣṭa** **vargaṇā** with an infinite number of **pradeśa** in its **skandha**, which is **grahaṇayoga** (grasping) for **manodravya** (mental matter). Above this **utkṛṣṭa** **grahaṇayoga** **vargaṇā** for **manodravya**, there is a **jighnya** **vargaṇā** with one more **pradeśa** than the **skandha** of the **utkṛṣṭa** **grahaṇayoga** **vargaṇā**, which is **agrahaṇayoga** (non-grasping). Above this **jighnya** **vargaṇā**, there is an **utkṛṣṭa** **vargaṇā** with an infinite number of **pradeśa** in its **skandha**, which is **agrahaṇayoga** (non-grasping). Above this **utkṛṣṭa** **vargaṇā**, there is a **jighnya** **vargaṇā** with one more **pradeśa** than the **skandha** of the **utkṛṣṭa** **vargaṇā**, which is **grahaṇayoga** (grasping) for **karma** (karmic matter). Above this **jighnya** **vargaṇā**, there is an **utkṛṣṭa** **vargaṇā** with an infinite number of **pradeśa** in its **skandha**, which is **grahaṇayoga** (grasping) for **karma** (karmic matter).

In this way, there are eight **grahaṇayoga** (grasping) **vargaṇā** and eight **agrahaṇayoga** (non-grasping) **vargaṇā**. The **agrahaṇayoga** **vargaṇā** are situated between the **grahaṇayoga** **vargaṇā**. For example, **agrahaṇayoga** **vargaṇā**, **audārika** **vargaṇā**, **agrahaṇayoga** **vargaṇā**, **vakriya** **vargaṇā**, and so on.

The number of **paramāṇu** (atoms) in one **skandha** of the **jighnya** **agrahaṇayoga** **vargaṇā** is an infinite number of times less than the number of **paramāṇu** in one **skandha** of the **utkṛṣṭa** **agrahaṇayoga** **vargaṇā**. The number of **paramāṇu** in one **skandha** of the **jighnya** **grahaṇayoga** **vargaṇā** is an infinite number of times less than the number of **paramāṇu** in one **skandha** of the **utkṛṣṭa** **grahaṇayoga** **vargaṇā**.

The essence of this entire statement is that as the number of **pradeśa** in the **skandha** of the **utkṛṣṭa** **vargaṇā** increases, the **pradeśa** of the **jighnya** **vargaṇā** increases accordingly. The **utkṛṣṭa** **vargaṇā** of the **agrahaṇayoga** **vargaṇā** is its own...

The ultimate fraction of the ultimate fraction of the lowest class is multiplied by the ultimate fraction of the ultimate fraction of the highest class.
The purpose of explaining and stating the sixteen types of classifications here is to bring into view the outline of the nature of what is transformed into the form of karma.
Having explained the nature of the acceptable classifications and the evidence of their understanding, we now state the atoms of the unacceptable classifications in the next verse.

1 Panchasangraha also describes the classifications in the same way as the Karmagrantha. The classifications beyond the 16 classifications are described as follows: Kammar Dhurerasunna Pattamvasrishnavamariya |

**Verse Meaning:**  Between the Audarik (generous) and other categories, there are countless, immeasurable categories of Agahanayogya (unperceivable) categories, each containing one more atom than the previous. The Audarik and other categories are infinitely greater than their respective inferior categories.

**Explanation:** The previous two verses explained the names of the Grahanayogya (perceivable) categories and their characteristics. They also mentioned that the Vimaranayogya (imperceptible) categories are differentiated within the Mahaayogya (great) categories. This verse explains the characteristics of the Agahanayogya categories and the difference between the inferior and superior Grahanayogya categories.

Although we have hinted at the characteristics of the Agahanayogya categories while discussing the Grahanayogya categories, we will clarify it again briefly here. In each Skandha (group) of the superior Grahanayogya category, there is an Agahanayogya inferior category consisting of groups of Skandhas with one more atom. Subsequently, there is another Agahanayogya category consisting of groups of Skandhas with two more atoms. Similarly, one should understand the third, fourth, and subsequent Agahanayogya categories with three more, four more, and so on.

The Agahanayogya superior category consists of groups of Skandhas containing as many atoms as the number of atoms in one Skandha of the Agahanayogya inferior category multiplied by an infinite fraction of the Siddha-rashi (the number of atoms in the liberated soul). Therefore, each Agahanayogya category is described as an infinite fraction of the Siddha-rashi. This is because the number of atoms in one Skandha of the inferior Agahanayogya category is obtained by multiplying the Siddha-rashi by an infinite fraction. Therefore, from the inferior to the superior...

There are as many variations of *agrahaṇa* *vargaṇā* as there are variations of *agrahaṇa* *vargaṇā*, meaning that each *agrahaṇa* *vargaṇā* should be known. It is not that the total number of *agrahaṇa* *vargaṇā* is infinite like the number of seeds in a *simi*.

Another thing to know about *agrahaṇa* *vargaṇā* is that they occur in the interval between *grahaṇa* *vargaṇā*, with an *agrahaṇa* *vargaṇā* following a *grahaṇa* *vargaṇā* and a *grahaṇa* *vargaṇā* following an *agrahaṇa* *vargaṇā*. It is not that some of these *vargaṇā* occur before the *audārika* *vargaṇā* and some after. Similarly, one should understand the *grahaṇa-yoga* *vargaṇā* of *vaikriya* etc.

The *utkṛṣṭa* of *agrahaṇa* *vargaṇā* is multiplied by the infiniteth part of its own *jghanya* from the *siddh* *rāśi*, and the *utkṛṣṭa* of *grahaṇa-yoga* *vargaṇā* is more than its own *jghanya* by the infiniteth part. That is, there are infinite parts more atoms in the *utkṛṣṭa* *grahaṇa-yoga* *skandha* than in the *jghanya* *grahaṇa-yoga* *skandha*.

Thus, after considering the *vargaṇā* in all ways, such as *grāhya-agrahya*, *utkṛṣṭa-jghanya*, etc., we will now explain in the next verse the type of *karma-skandha* that the *jīva* takes on.

**Final verse:**

*Antīmcha uphāsa bugandha panchavanna rasa sambandha valam. Samvajiyananta guna rasa majutta maṇataya paesa.* || 7 || *Egpaesogāvam niyasambapaesaj gahed jīu.*

**Meaning:**

*Antīmcha uphāsa* - In the end, four *sparna*, two *durgandha*, five *kalarasa*, and five *gāma* are obtained. *Kammaṇadhavalankarma-skandha* - The *karma-skandha* of the *balika*. *Samvajiyananta guna rasa* - In the *maya* *jīva* there are also infinite *guna* and *rasa*. *Aṇuyukta* - Composed of atoms. *Amatapapaesam* - Infinite *pradeśa* are obtained. *Egpaesogāvam* - In one *kṣetra* in the form of *abmāda*.

**Shataka**

Thus, a single atom possesses two of the four touch sensations: one form, one taste, one smell, and one touch. However, the aggregates of these atoms, which form the karma-skandhas, can possess all five colors, five tastes, two smells, and four touch sensations. This is because the karma-skandha contains many atoms, and among these atoms, some possess a particular form, some a particular taste, and some a particular smell. Additionally, some atoms possess the touch sensation of smoothness and heat, while others possess the touch sensation of roughness and coldness, from the four touch sensations of coldness, heat, smoothness, and roughness. Therefore, karma-skandhas are described as having five colors, five tastes, two smells, and four touch sensations. For this reason, the author of the text has described the karma-skandha as possessing four touch sensations, two smells, five colors, and five tastes.

**1**

The reason why karma-skandhas are called "four-touched" is that, out of the eight types of touch sensations described, the karma-skandhas from the "grahana" (receiving) category up to the "varna" (color) category of the "aaharaka" (nutritive) body possess all eight touch sensations. However, the karma-skandha that is the "utpadaka" (producer) of these categories possesses only four touch sensations. This is because it is the smallest entity, and therefore the ultimate, subtle, and eternal. It possesses one taste, one smell, one color, and two touch sensations. Its function can only be inferred, not directly perceived.

An atom possesses one of the two touch sensations of coldness and heat, and one of the two touch sensations of smoothness and roughness, thus possessing two touch sensations.

**1**

The "Karmagrantha" (text on karma) states in its "Svopja" (self-generated) commentary that the commentary on the "Brihat Shataka" (Great Hundred Verses) states that the karma-skandha definitely possesses the touch sensations of softness and lightness. In addition to these, it also possesses two more touch sensations from the following pairs: smoothness and heat, smoothness and coldness, roughness and heat, or roughness and coldness. Therefore, a karma-skandha is described as possessing four touch sensations.

## The Fifth Karma-Prastha

**281**

In the categories of the Taijas-sharira and above, there are only four touches.

**"Pancharaspanchavanhi parinama atthaphass vo gandha. Jiyahaarganogga chaufasthilesiya jari."**

This means that the categories suitable for the soul, like Audarik, etc., have five tastes, five colors, eight touches, and two smells. However, the categories suitable for the Taijas-sharira and above have only four touches.

There are two types of substances: Gurulghu and Agurulghu. The division of categories into these two types is explained in the necessary instructions:

**"Oralayadamviyahaarayatem gurulhuvarna. Kammagapanbhaasai eyaai agurulai."**

Audarik, Vaikriya, Aaharak, and Taijas substances are Gurulghu, while Karman, Bhasha, and Manogavya are Agurulghu.

To identify Gurulghu and Agurulghu, the Dravy-Lok-Prakash, Sarg 11, Shlok 24 states that the substance with eight touches, like a cloud, is Gurulghu. The substance with four touches, like subtle forms and the intangible sky, etc., are Agurulghu.

Therefore, since the Taijas category is Gurulghu, it has eight touches. The subsequent categories like Bhasha, Karma, etc., are Agurulghu, and thus have four touches.

This explains a specific characteristic of the Karma-skandha, which is taken in by the soul: "The final four touches..."

**"Panchasangrah 410"**

**"Dhadaramasthasparsh dravyam pyab bhavati gurulghukan. Agurulghu chatuhsparsh sukshma viyadayamurtam api."**

**Matka**

The 'dugandhpalabannar amjhammandhadal' or karma-skandha have four final touches, two gandhas, five varna and five rasa. Now, we will describe their second vigapana, that they are the holders of rasa, which is infinite in quantity, from the karma-skandha majijanantgunaranam matra jobarashi. Here, the meaning of rasa is not the five types of rasa like sour, sweet, etc., but the power to give auspicious and inauspicious fruits in those karma-skandha. This rasa is found in every pudgala. Just as the smallest part of pudgala dravya is called paramanu, similarly, the smallest part of shakti is called rasaanu. These rasaanu are formed by the division of buddhi. Because, just as the pudgala dvanda can be divided into pieces, the qualities residing inside it cannot be divided. Still, we know the predominance of qualities in visible objects through our senses. For example, if we see the milk of a buffalo, cow, and goat, we can test and say that buffalo milk has more fat, cow milk has less fat, and goat milk has no fat. In this way, although the quality of fat cannot be divided into separate parts, its intensity can be known. This intensity proves that...

1. Rasaanu are also called gunaanu or bhaavaanu, and they are formed by the division of buddhi. As it is written in Panchmagraha...

"Panchanda sariraanam paramananan maiye animago.
Karishyamana ganso gunaanu bhaavaanu ya hani." ||417||

The indivisible part of the power of the paramanu, which is suitable for the five bodies, that is divided by buddhi, is called gunaanu or bhaavaanu.

It is through intellect that the components of the qualities can be understood, and their subtle nature is known. These components of the qualities are called **rasaṇu**. These **rasaṇu** are also infinite in number, even in the most gross **pudgala** substance, which is the **dravya** with the lowest **rama**. Therefore, the **karma-skandha** is said to be composed of an infinite number of **rasaṇu**, which are smaller than the smallest **dravya** - **aṇujutta**. These **rasaṇu** themselves, upon becoming the cause of the **bhāva** of the living being, bear fruit in the form of bitter or sweet (inauspicious or auspicious).

The third characteristic of the **karma-skandha** is that each **karma-skandha** is infinite in extent. It is not that the number of regions of the **karma-skandha** is fixed. But each **karma-skandha** has an infinite number of regions, meaning it is composed of an infinite number of atoms.

The essence of the above statement is that the **karma-skandha** taken in by the living being is **pudgalic**, and being **pudgalic**, it possesses **pudgalic** qualities like **p**, **rasa**, etc. It also has the power to bear fruit, which is infinite in number, even greater than the number of all living beings, and it is infinite in extent. Thus, one should know the nature of the **karma-skandha** taken in by the living being.

After explaining the nature of the **karma-skandha** in this way,

**Jīvammā jvamāyā mubhāmumāsa loyārimāṇā. Salvajīyāṇataguṇā ekatrako hoti māvāṇ. - Vachasaha 136**

Due to the **anubhāga**, the results of the living being in the form of **kṣaya** arise in two ways - auspicious and inauspicious. The auspicious results are equal to the regions of the **amanyata lokākāśa**, and the inauspicious results are also equal to that. In the **karma-pudgala** taken in by each result, there are infinite **bhāvaṇu** (**rasaṇu**) in all living beings.

## Chapter 
Now we will explain which karmas are absorbed by the jivas in which regions and what is the process of absorption.

It has been clarified earlier that the entire universe is filled with pudgala dravya. This pudgala dravya is divided into many categories like audarika, etc. and because of being pudgalatmak, these are found in the entire universe. Among these categories, karma-vargana is also one, therefore karma-vargana is also present everywhere in the universe. Out of these universal karma-varganas, each jiva absorbs those karma-varganas which are closest to it. **Ayakshetogadha** - meaning the karma-varganas present in the region closest to the jiva are absorbed by the jiva. Just like when a heated iron ball is dropped into water, it absorbs the water closest to it but not the water far away, similarly, the jiva absorbs the karma-varganas present in the same sky regions where it is situated. The process of absorption of karmas by the jiva is like this: just as a heated iron ball, when dropped into water, pulls water from all sides, similarly, the jiva also absorbs karmas from all its regions.

1. (a) **Ayakshetogadha** sabya pade sehi kammani jogga. Bandham maghehi ya anadiyam shadiy ubhvam || Go. Karmakand 185
A jiva binds anadi, madi and ubhvam forms of dravya which are capable of becoming karma in a single region, when it gets the cause in all regions. 
(b) Ragpaesogavae sabpaye mehi mano jogge. Jivo pomaladache gipahai mai anai da - panchamagraha 284
A jiva absorbs madi or anadi pudgala dravya which are capable of becoming karma in a single region, from all its regions.

## The Fifth Karma Granth
### 285

It is not the case that karma is received by a specific part of the soul. To explain this, the verse states:

**"Just as a living being does not receive the karma-bundles situated in a specific area by a specific part of itself, but receives karma by all parts of the soul."**

After explaining the nature of the karma-bundles received by the living being and the process of their reception, we now clarify how the received *atra* is divided.

**"The portion of *āyus* karma is the least, the portion of *nāma* karma is equal to the portion of *gotra* karma. The portion of *antarāya*, *jñānāvaraṇa*, and *darśanāvaraṇa* is greater than the portion of *nāma* and *gotra*. The portion of *mohaniya* is greater than that, and the portion of *vedaniya* is the greatest."**

**Word meanings:**

* ***āyus*:** lifespan karma
* ***nāma*:** name karma
* ***gotra*:** lineage karma
* ***antarāya*:** obstruction karma
* ***jñānāvaraṇa*:** knowledge-obscuring karma
* ***darśanāvaraṇa*:** perception-obscuring karma
* ***mohaniya*:** delusion karma
* ***vedaniya*:** experience karma

**Explanation:**

The portion of *āyus* karma is the smallest. The portions of *nāma* and *gotra* karma are equal. The portions of *antarāya*, *jñānāvaraṇa*, and *darśanāvaraṇa* are equal to each other, but greater than the portions of *nāma* and *gotra*. The portion of *mohaniya* is greater than that, and the portion of *vedaniya* is the greatest.

**In other words:**

* Lifespan karma is the least significant.
* Name and lineage karma are equally significant.
* Obstruction, knowledge-obscuring, and perception-obscuring karma are equally significant, but more significant than name and lineage karma.
* Delusion karma is more significant than obstruction, knowledge-obscuring, and perception-obscuring karma.
* Experience karma is the most significant.

## Translation:

This is the part of the most painful karma. Because with a small amount of substance, the experience of painful karma cannot be clearly understood. Apart from the painful karma, the other karmas get their respective parts according to their own nature. In this context, the *Visheshaarya* explains the division of the karma-skandhas taken by the soul into *Jnanavaran* etc. natures.

Just as food, after entering the stomach, gradually transforms into different forms like *rasa*, *rudhira* etc., similarly, the karma-varganas taken by the soul at every moment are also divided into as many parts as the number of karmas bound by that soul at that moment.

It has been explained earlier that the soul continuously takes in karma-skandhas at every moment, but it has also been clarified that the binding of karma does not happen always, but only in the divisions of the *bhunyaman* lifespan, and that too until the *antmuhurt*. Even in these divisions, if the binding does not happen, then it definitely happens in the *antmuhurt* lifespan, leading to the binding of the lifespan of the next birth. Therefore, at the time when the soul binds the *ayukarma*, the taken karma-skandhas are divided into eight karmas including *ayukarma*, *jnanavaran* etc., meaning they are divided into eight parts. And at the time when the binding of lifespan does not happen, the taken karma-skandhas are divided into the remaining seven karmas, excluding *ayukarma*, like *jnanavaran* etc.

This is a general rule. But during the ascent of the *gunasthanas*, when the soul attains the tenth subtle *samparaya* *gunasthan*, it binds the remaining six karmas except *ayukarma* and *mohniya* karma. Therefore, at that time, the taken karma-skandhas are divided into only six karmas.

## The Fifth Bheragrahnas

**287**

There are eleven Gunasthans, and from the eleventh onwards, a bond of one Saatavedanoy Karma occurs. Therefore, the Karma-skandha acquired at that time becomes one Karma form.

Thus, one should understand the order of the acquired Karma-skandha being divided into eight Karmas. Now, we will explain the share received by each Karma, clarifying that each Karma receives a portion of the acquired Karma-skandha according to its own time-position. This means that the Karma with a lower position will receive less, and the Karma with a higher position will receive more. However, this general rule applies to the remaining seven Karmas, excluding Vedaniya Karma. The reason for Vedaniya Karma receiving a larger share will be explained later.

Since Ayukarma has the lowest position, we will first explain the division of Karma-skandha from Ayukarma. The share of Ayukarma is the least. This is because the position of Ayukarma is only thirty-three Sagars, while the remaining seven Karmas, including Name, Gotra, etc., have a superior position of twenty Kodakodi Sagars, some have half Kodakodi Sagars, and some have seventy Kodakodi Sagars. Therefore, compared to the position of other Karmas, Ayukarma has the lowest position, so it receives the least share of the acquired Karma-skandha.

The share of Name and Gotra Karma is more than Ayukarma. This is because the position of Ayukarma is only thirty-three Sagars, while the position of Name and Gotra Karma is twenty Kodakodi Sagars. The position of Name and Gotra Karma is the same, so they should receive an equal share - Name and Gotra are equal. The Karmas of Antaray, Gnanavaran, and Darshanavaran receive a share... 

Page #325:
---------------------------
The share of the **chala** and **gotra** karmas is greater than that of the **name** and **gotra** karmas. Because the state of the **name** and **gotra** karmas is twenty-twenty **koda-kodi** sagaras, while the state of each of the three karmas, **antaraya**, etc., is thirty-thirty **koda-kodi** sagaras. But since the state of these three karmas is the same, their share is equal. Of these three karmas, the share of the **mohaniya** karma is greater, because its state is seventy **koda-kodi** sagaras.

Thus, except for the **vedaniya** karma, the remaining seven karmas are shown to receive more **pudgala-skandhas** in proportion to their state. Now, the reason for the **vedaniya** karma receiving more matter is explained by the **Manvovar Veyaniya**. Because without a lot of matter, the experience of pleasure, pain, etc., of the **vedaniya** karma is not clear. With little matter, the **vedaniya** karma is not able to perform its function of causing the experience of pleasure and pain - **Jenape Tassa Phudatta Na Havayi**. But only with more matter is it able to perform its function. The reason for the **vedaniya** karma receiving more matter is that the **nirjara** of the **vedaniya** karma is greater due to the cause of pleasure and pain. That is, every living being experiences pleasure and pain every moment, so the **vedaniya** karma arises every moment, and its **nirjara** is also greater. This
1. **Kramo Buddathi Nam Bhago Daligassa Hoda Sarviso. Taiyamya Macchjattho Lasma Phudatam**
||
- **Panchasangraha 205**
The share of the karmas with a higher state is less than that of the **vedaniya** karma, but the share of the **vedaniya** karma is the greatest because its distinct experience cannot be had with little matter.

Pachma Karbha.
286 The substance of it is the most. From this, even when the state of Vedaniya Karma is twenty Koḍakoḍi Sagara, it gets the most part.
In this way, the division of Karma Skandha in the original natures is explained. Now, in the next verse, its order in the subsequent natures is explained.
Niyajailalddavaliyagantaso hoi samvaghaiṇ. Bajmatiṇ vimjjai sesaṇ sesaṇ paisamayaṃ. ||1||
Shabdarth Niyajailalbadaliy - obtained by its original nature form caste, kam daliko, ashansanso - infinite part, hoi - is, savvaghai - all-destroying natures, bajjhatiṇ - binding, vimān - divided. Ses - remaining part, sesaṇ - in the remaining natures, paisamayaṃ - every time.
Gathary - The infinite part of the Karma Daliko obtained by their respective original natures is obtained by the all-destroying natures and the remaining part is divided among the binding natures every time. Special meaning - The verse states that the Pudgal substance obtained by the original Karma Natures is divided and obtained by the subsequent natures of those Karmas. Because the subsequent natures

There is no independent entity except the original nature. But it should be kept in mind that just as the assumed pudgala dravya is divided into the same karmas in which it is bound at that time, in the same way, the part that each original nature gets, that part is also divided into the same Uttar Prakritis in which it is bound at that time and the Prakritis which are not bound at that time, they do not get any part at that time.
Out of the eight original karmas like Sanavarana etc., Panavarana, Darshanavarana, Mohaniya and Antaraya are the four Dhatikarma and Vedaniya, Aayu, Naam and Gotra are the four Aghatikarma. Some Uttar Prakritis are Sarvaghatini and some are Deshaghatini in Ghatikarma. In the gatha, the obtained dravya's mind has been told keeping in mind the Sarvaghatini and Deshadhatini Prakritis that - "Anantaso hoi savvaghainam - the part that the Ghatikas get, its infinite part is in the Sarvaghatini Prakritis and the remaining Bahubhav bandhne wali Deshavati Prakritis are divided. - "Bajanthin vibhajji se san sesan paisa mayam.
Ja samay mavasyaai kandhae taan eris bihiye.

Tiha ya ah panchaha vigdhe. - Karmaprakriti, Bandhanakaran, Pa. 25 The karmadalik Sarvaghatini Prakritis get, it is the infinite part of the part that gets to its own original nature and the remaining is divided among the Deshaghatini Prakritis. Therefore, the remaining part of the knowledge is divided into four parts and its four countries 
(See next page) 

Page #328:

## The Fifth Karma Granth
### 265

This is explained as follows: There are five Uttar Prakritis of Jnanavarana. Among them, only the Jnanavarana Prakriti is Sarvaghatini, and the remaining four are Deshaghatini. Therefore, the Pudgala Dravya that transforms into the Jnanavarana form, its infinite part is Sarvaghati, hence it gets the Jnanavarana, and the remaining Deshaghati Dravya is divided into four Deshaghati Prakritis.

There are nine Uttar Prakritis of Darshanavarana. Among them, only Darshanavarana and the five Nidras, from Nidra to Styadi, are Sarvaghatini, and the remaining three Prakritis are Deshaghatini. Therefore, the Dravya that transforms into the Darshanavarana form, its infinite part being Sarvadhati, is divided into six Sarvaghatini Prakritis, and the remaining Dravya is divided into three Deshaghatini Prakritis.

The part of the Mohaniya Karma that is received, its infinite part is Sarvaghati, and the remaining is Deshaghati Dravya. There are two types of Mohaniya Karma: Darshanamohaniya and Charitramohaniya. Therefore, the received Sarvanati Dravya is also divided into two parts. One part goes to Darshanamohaniya, and the remaining part goes to Charitramohaniya.

The infinite part of the Dravya received by the Darshanavarana goes to its six Sarvaghatini Prakritis, and the remaining Dravya of the Darshanavarana is divided into three parts and goes to its three Deshaghatini Prakritis. However, the part received by the Antaraya Karma is completely divided into five parts and goes to its five Deshaghatini Prakritis, because none of the Antaraya's Prakritis are Sarvaghatini.

(b) **Sabukkosarato jo mulavibhagasasanam timo bhago. Sambadhaiin dija mo iyaro desghanam.**

- Panchasangrah 434

The infinite part of the Dravya received by the Prakriti, which is the best Rasa, Vasa, and Damya, goes to the Sarvashasini Prakritis, and the remaining, which is Mayurakashta, Rasa, Vasa, and Samatini, is given to the Mahatis.

**Century**

And the second part belongs to the *Charitramohaniya*. The complete part obtained by the *Darshanmohaniya* is received by its opposite nature, *Mithyatva*, because it is *Sarvaghatini*. But the part obtained by the *Charitramohaniya* is divided into twelve parts, becoming the *Anantanu bandhi* *Kashaya* quartet, the *Apratyakhyanaadharana* *Kashaya* quartet, and the *Pratyakhyanaavaran* *Kashaya* quartet. There are two parts of the *Deshghati* substance of the *Mohaniya* karma. One part is of the *Kashaya Mohaniya* and the other is of the *Nokshaya Mohaniya*. The substance of the *Kashaya Mohaniya* is divided into four parts, which are received by *Sanchalan*, *Krodha*, *Mana*, *Maya*, and *Lobha*. The *Nokshaya Mohaniya* is divided into five parts, which are received by one of the three *Vedas* (the *Badyaman Veda*), the pair of *Hasya* and *Rati*, the pair of *Shoka* and *Arati* (each pair receives one part), and *Bhaya* and *Jugupsa*.

## The Fifth Karma Group: Antaray Karma

The portion of Antaray Karma received is divided into five parts, and these five parts are distributed to its five resultant natures: Dana, Antaray, etc. This is because Antaray Karma is a traitor to the country and, being permanently bound, its five natures, Dana, Antaray, etc., are always bound.

After explaining the division of the substance received in the resultant natures of the Dharmic Karmas, we now clarify the division of the portion received by the Vedaniya, Ayu, Nama, and Gotra Karmas.

Vedaniya Karma has two resultant natures, but only one of them is bound at a time. Therefore, the substance received by Vedaniya Karma goes to the one nature that is bound at that time. Similarly, one should understand that only one resultant nature of Ayu Karma is bound at a time, and the portion received by Ayu Karma goes to the one nature that is bound at that time.

The original portion received by Nama Karma is divided among its binding resultant natures. That is, the portion is distributed among the following: Gati, Jati, Sarira, Upanga, Bandhana, Sanghata, Sanhanana, Sansthana Anupurvi, Varna Chatushk, Aguru Laghu, Paraghata, Udyota, Upghata, Uchchvasa, Nirmana, Tirthankara, Atap, Vihayogati, and Sadshak or Stavardashak.

The portion received by the Mohaniya Karma is further divided into two parts: half goes to the Kshaya Mohaniya and half goes to the Nokpaya Mohaniya. The portion received by the Kshaya Mohaniya is further divided into four parts, and these four parts are given to Sanjwalana Krodha, Mana, Maya, and Lobha. The Nokshaya Mohaniya has five parts, which are given to one of the three Vedas, one of the pairs of Hasya-Rani and Shoka-Arati, Praya, and Jugupsa. This is because all five Nokshaya Karmas are bound at the same time. 

Page #331:
---------------------------
**224**

The substance obtained is divided into as many parts as there are bonds at a time.

**Commentary**

A special feature of some of the aforementioned natures is that the portion received by the fourfold classification is divided among their sub-categories. For example, the portion received by the name "color" is divided into five parts, becoming the sub-categories of white, etc. Similarly, one should understand that the portion received by the sub-categories of smell, taste, and touch is divided among their sub-categories. The portion received by the karmas of "aggregate" and "body" is divided into three or four parts, which are received by the three or four natures of "aggregate" and "body." The reason for the division of "aggregate" and "body" karma into three or four parts is that if the three bodies of "audaryika," "tejasa," and "karmana," or the three aggregates of "vaikriya," "tejasa," and "karmana," are bound together, then there are three parts. And if the four bodies of "vaikriya," "aharaka," "tejasa," and "karmana," and the four aggregates are bound together, then there are four divisions.

If the portion received by the name "bond" is bound to three bodies, then there are seven parts. And if it is bound to four bodies, then there are eleven parts. The seven and eleven parts should be understood as follows: If there is a bond of the seven bonds of "audaryika-audaryika," "audaryika-tejasa," "audaryika-karmana," "audaryika-tejasa-karmana," "tejasa-tejasa," "tejasa-karmana," and "karmana-karmana," then there are seven parts. Or if there is a bond of the seven bonds of "vaikriya-vaikriya," "vaikriya-tejasa," "vaikriya-karmana," "vaikriya-tejasa-karmana," "tejasa-tejasa," "tejasa-karmana," and "karmana-karmana," then there are seven parts. And if there is a bond of the eleven bonds of the fourfold "vaikriya," the fourfold "aharaka," and the three of "tejasa" and "karmana," then there are eleven parts. 

Page #332:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma Granth
215

Except for the Name Karma, there are no further divisions in the other Karma types. Therefore, the portion received is entirely allocated to the single nature that binds. Because the other natures are mutually contradictory, the binding of one prevents the binding of another. For example, the binding of one type of motion prevents the binding of another type of motion. Similarly, when one type of birth, status, and assembly, and one type of Sadhaka binds, the binding of the Stavardashaka does not occur.

The portion received by the Gotra Karma is entirely allocated to its single binding nature, as only one nature of Gotra Karma binds at a time.

When the binding of a nature is severed from its respective quality-place within the sequence of these binding natures, its portion is divided among the similar natures. And if the similar

1 The distribution of the substance of Vedaniya, Ayu, Gotra, and Name Karma among their respective natures is described in the Karma nature as follows:
"Veṇimagotsu bajjhamaṇīṇa bhāgo si || Pipgatīsu bajjhatigāṇa vanarasagandhaphāsāṇaṁ | Samvāsi saṁghāta tashummi ya tige caukke vā ||"
Bandhanakaraṇa G. 26, 27
The original portion received by Vedaniya, Ayu, and Gotra Karma is allocated to their respective single binding natures, as only one nature of these Karmas binds at a time. The portion received by Name Karma is allocated to its various binding natures. The portion received by color, smell, taste, and touch is allocated to all their sub-natures. The portion received by assembly and body is divided into three or four parts. 

Page #333:
---------------------------
195
If the bond of a hundredth nature is broken, the substance belonging to it is received by the heterogeneous natures under its own root nature. If the bond of those heterogeneous natures is also broken, then the substance is not received by the root nature, but by other root natures. For example, when the bond of the sthānāndhitrika is broken, the substance belonging to it is received by its homogeneous nature, nidrā and prachala, and when the bond of nidrā and prachala is also broken, their substance is received by the heterogeneous natures like chakshudarshanaavaran, etc., under their own root nature. When their bond is also broken, all the substance is received by the sātavedaniya in the eleventh and subsequent gṛhasthānas. In the same way, one should understand about other natures. In short, when the bond of a nature is broken, its part is received by the homogeneous nature, and when the bond of that homogeneous nature is also broken, it is received by the heterogeneous natures under the root nature. If the bond of that root nature is broken, then this substance starts being received by the other existing root natures.

According to the method described above, the root and subsequent natures receive karmadalis, and the jīva destroys a large part of those karmadalis through the process of guṇoṇi creation. Therefore, now we will tell the nature, number, and names of the guṇashreṇi. First, we will tell the number and names of the guṇashreṇi. 1 Go. Karmakāṇḍa Ga. 196 to 206 describes the distribution of pudgala dravya in the subsequent natures, and the karmaprakriti (Pradeshaban Ga 28) does not give a complete description of the division of dālikas. However, it has been stated that there is a predominance of kamalika in the subsequent natures. The meaning of both these bonds is given in the appendix.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

**Sammadarasaṃvavirayi avisajoyasakhavage hēṃ. Mohasamasantkhabage khīṇasajogīyar guṇaseḍho 11**

**Word Meaning:**

* **Sammadarasaṃvavirayi:** Samyaktva, Deśaviraṭi, Sarvaviraṭi, Avisajoy (disconnection from infinite attachments), Dasakhayo (destruction of Darshanamohiya), Mohasama (pacification of Charitramohiya), Santoupaśāmtmoha (pacified moha), Kharage (death), Khīṇ (diminished moha), Sajogīyar (Sayogikevali and Ayogikevali), Guṇaseṭhi (Guṇashreṇi).

**Verse Meaning:**

Samyaktva, Deśaviraṭi, Sarvaviraṭi, disconnection from infinite attachments, destruction of Darshanamohiya, pacification of Charitramohiya, pacified moha, destruction, diminished moha, Sayogikevali and Ayogikevali are the eleven qualities.

**Special Meaning:**

Although the state and essence of bound karmas can be destroyed by auspicious results without experiencing them, their destruction requires experiencing them. In other words, the destruction of karma particles cannot happen without experiencing them. 

The living being experiences karma particles every moment, leading to their destruction. This destruction of karmas through experience is called **Aupakramika Nirjara** or **Savipāka Nirjara**. 

However, this type of destruction only affects a limited number of karma particles. Moreover, the cycle of binding new karmas continues alongside this experiential destruction. This means that new karmas are bound through this experiential destruction, rendering it ineffective in truly destroying karmas and freeing the being from karma bondage.

Therefore, to be free from karma bondage, it is essential to destroy as many karma atoms as possible in the shortest time, and their number should continuously increase. 

Page #335:
---------------------------
##  Chapter 26: Sins and the Concept of Gunadhonis

One should understand the concept of sins. The rapid depletion of a large number of karma particles in a short period of time is called **Gunadhonis**. This type of depletion can only occur when there is a progressive increase in the purity of the soul's emotions.  Ascending to higher levels of purity leads to the depletion of a larger number of karma particles. 

The verse mentions the names of the purity levels in order, where the depletion of karma particles increases progressively. These levels are called **Gunadhonis** because they are the cause of **Gunadhonis** depletion or creation. Their names are as follows:

1. **Samyaktva** (attainment of right faith), 
2. **Deshaviriti** (renunciation of worldly attachments), 
3. **Sarvaviriti** (renunciation of all attachments), 
4. **Anantanubandhi Kashaya Vinsanyojana** (dissociation of infinite attachments), 
5. **Darshanamohaniya Kshapana** (destruction of the veil of perception), 
6. **Charitramoha Upshamana** (subduing the delusion of conduct), 
7. **Upshantamoha** (subdued delusion), 
8. **Kshapana** (destruction), 
9. **Kshina Moha** (diminished delusion), 
10. **Sayogikevali** (liberated with subtle karmas), 
11. **Ayogikevali** (liberated without any karmas).

In brief, the meaning is that when a being performs actions like **Apuvrakaran** (initial actions) to attain **Samyaktva**, an innumerable number of **Gunadhonis** are created. 

**The verse:**

"**Sammatadesa Unnjahrirapati Man Ghisa Sanjoga. Dampan Khavane Moha Sma Samane Upamant Khabage Ya.** 
**Khinainige Asankh Gunia Gunase Dvidaliya Jahamaso. Mamata Hanekkarasaha Kalo U Sambanse.**"

**Translation:**

"In the creation of **Deshaviriti** and **Sarvaviriti**, in the dissociation of **Anantanubandhi** attachments, in the destruction of **Darshanamohaniya**, in the subduing of **Mohaniya**, in **Upshantamoha**, in the **Apak** series, and in the three **Gunasthanas** of **Minakashaya** etc., an innumerable number of **Gunadhonis** are created. An innumerable number of **Gunadhonis** create the **Gunashreni** of **Dalikas**, and the time sequence of the twelve **Gunashrenis** of **Maya** etc. is known as **Praghata Marg** (the path of liberation)." 

Page #336:
---------------------------
## The Fivefold Path (Panchakarmapath)

The **Panchakarmapath** is a process that eliminates an innumerable amount of karmas and continues even after attaining **Samyaktva** (right faith). This is the first **guna-shreni** (quality series) called **Samyaktva**. Compared to the other **guna-shreni**, this series has a slower purification process at the time of attaining **Samyaktva**. Therefore, it creates fewer **karma-dalikas** (karma particles) than the other series, but the duration of their experience is longer. However, it should be understood that the number of **karma-dalikas** is greater and the time is shorter compared to the state before attaining **Samyaktva**. This first **guna-shreni** called **Samyaktva** can be considered the seed of **karma-nirjara** (karma elimination).

After attaining **Samyaktva**, when the soul partially practices **virati** (restraint), the second **guna-shreni** called **desha-virati** (partial restraint) arises. In this series, the number of **karma-dalikas** created is innumerably greater than the first series, and the time of experience is innumerably less.

When the soul practices complete **virati**, the third **guna-shreni** arises. This series is infinitely purer than **desha-virati**. Therefore, the number of **karma-dalikas** created in this series is innumerably greater than the previous one, but the time of their experience is innumerably less.

When the soul detaches from **ananta-anubandhi kshaya** (infinitely connected passions), meaning all the **karma-dalikas** of **ananta-anubandhi kshaya** are transformed into other forms of passions, the fourth **guna-shreni** arises.

When the three natures of **darshan-mohaniya** (knowledge-obscuring karma) - **Samyaktva**, **Samyag-mithyatva** (partially right and partially wrong faith), and **mithyatva** (wrong faith) - are destroyed, the fifth **guna-shreni** called **darshan-mohaniya kshapan** (destruction of knowledge-obscuring karma) arises.

In the eighth, ninth, and tenth **guna-sthana** (stages of spiritual progress), when **charitra-mohaniya** (conduct-obscuring karma) is pacified, the sixth **guna-shreni** called **charitra-mohaniya upashman** (pacification of conduct-obscuring karma) arises.

"There are eleven stages of the soul's progress, each marked by a specific level of spiritual development. The first three stages, known as Darshanamoha, Kshayapaka, and Upshantamoha, are characterized by the gradual elimination of the karmic defilements of perception, knowledge, and attachment. The fourth stage, Kshinamaha, marks the complete eradication of these defilements. The fifth stage, Sayogikevali, represents the attainment of omniscience, while the sixth stage, Ayogikevali, signifies the complete liberation from all karmic bonds.

These eleven stages are further divided into eleven levels of spiritual progress, known as Gunashreni. Each Gunashreni represents a specific level of spiritual attainment, with the first Gunashreni being the lowest and the eleventh being the highest.

The first Gunashreni is characterized by the elimination of an infinite number of karmic defilements, while the second Gunashreni eliminates an even greater number. This process continues until the eleventh Gunashreni, where all karmic defilements are completely eradicated.

The time required to eliminate these karmic defilements decreases with each Gunashreni. This means that the soul progresses more rapidly as it moves through the higher stages of spiritual development.

The Gunashreni are therefore considered to be the stages of spiritual progress, leading the soul towards liberation."

**Param Karmanyan**

If these Gunashrenis are divided in the order of Gunasthanas, then all the Gunasthanas from the fourth Gunasthan to the fourteenth Gunasthan, including the Abhibhuka Mithyadristi of Samyaktva-prapti, are included. The fourth, fifth, etc. Gunasthanas occur only when there is an increase in purity. Therefore, it is natural that the Gunashrenis in the subsequent Gunasthanas have more and more purity. _Thus, after explaining the eleven places of Gunashrenis, we now describe the nature of Gunashreni and the Nirjara that occurs in Gunashrenis._

**Gunasehi Balarayananu Samayamushyarsankhgunanaae. Eyagruna Pun Kamaso Asankhgunanijara Jivaa. ||3||**

**Word Meaning:**

* Gunasehi - Creation of Gunakara-pradeshas
* Balarapanau - Creation of Pradeshagra, descending from the upper position
* Agsamay - Every moment, from the moment of Udaya
* Asankhgunanaae - By countless multiplications
* Emguna - These aforementioned Gunas
* Pun - Again
* Kamaso - Gradually
* Asankhgunanijara - Countless Gunas Nirjara
* Jivaa - Souls

**(a) In Tattvarth Sutra 6.45, the names of Gunashrenis are mentioned as follows:**

* Sambahashti, Navak, Virata, Ananta, Viyojak, Darshan, Mohan, Pakop, Shamak, Upashanta, Modriksh, Pakkshin, Moh, Jina. These are countless Gunas in order.

In this, the place of Mayogi, Ayogi, and Kevali is replaced by just 'Jina', and the Tika-karg has counted it as one place.

**(b) In Swami Katikayanripreksha, Sayogi and Ayogi are counted:**

* Avago, Y Khina-moho, Soinah, Taaha, Ajoiya. These are countless Gunas Nirjara in the heart and body.

But in the Sanskrit Tika, Kevali and Samridh-at-kevali are counted, and 'Asoiya' is omitted.

In sequence, the countless-quality-possessing, countless-quality-possessing, Jiva-beings.
From the state of Gāpārṣa-above, from the moment of arising, to every moment, the countless-quality, countless-quality, karma-dalis are called Guṇaśroṇi, and the Jivas possessing the aforementioned qualities of Samyaktva, Deśaviratī, Sarvaviratī, etc., in sequence, perform countless-quality, countless-quality, Nirjarā.
In particular, the first stanza of the Gāthā describes the nature of Guṇaśroṇi, and the second stanza explains the proof of karma-Nirjarā of the Jivas possessing the Guṇadhīṇi mentioned in the previous Gāthā.
The eleven names mentioned earlier, namely Samyaktva, Deśaviratī, etc., are not themselves Guṇṇi, but they are the cause of Guṇaśroṇi due to the countless-quality, countless-quality, Nirjarā occurring in them in sequence. Therefore, they are called Guṇṇi by treating the effect in the cause. Guṇaśroṇi is a specific action, which is described in this Gāthā - "Guṇaseḍhī Dalaryāṇā..." This action begins with the attainment of Samyaktva. Therefore, we first consider the origin of Samyaktva. It has been previously explained that the Jiva performs three actions for the attainment of Samyaktva, namely Yathāpravṛttakarṇa, Apūrvakarṇa, and Anivṛttikarṇa. Upon entering Apūrvakarṇa, the following four actions begin:
First, Sthitighāta, second, Rasaghata, third, Navīna Sthitibandha, and fourth, Guṇṇi. Through Sthitighāta, the state of the previously bound karmas is reduced. That is, through Sthitighāta, the state of those very dalis is reduced, whose state is one end...

## Panchakarma Granth, Chapter 3

The duration of the *muhurt* is greater than the duration of the *sthiti*. Therefore, by destroying the *sthiti*, the *karmadalikas* which would have emerged after a long time, become ready to emerge immediately. From those *karmadalikas* whose *sthiti* is reduced, countless, countless *dalikas* are taken and established upwards from the time of emergence. The order of deposition of *karmadalikas* is as follows: *karmadalikas* are taken from the upper *sthiti* and a few *dalikas* are deposited at the time of emergence, then countless, countless *dalikas* are deposited at the next time. In this way, countless, countless *dalikas* are deposited at every moment until the end of the *antarmuhurt* time. That is, the *dalikas* which are taken at the first time...

**Footnotes:**

1. The 15th verse of *Karma-prakriti* (Upashmanakaran) also describes the nature of the *gunashreni* in the same way in its ancient *Churni* and *Panchasangrah*. It is as follows:

> *Gunasethi nivakheva sameye mameye asankhgunanaaye. Asadugaairisee sesa sese ya niklevo.*
>
> *Karma-prakriti Upashmanakaran, verse 15*

The deposition of countless, countless *dalikas* at every moment is called *gunashreni*. Its duration is slightly longer than the duration of *bapurvakaran* and *anivalikaran*. In this duration, as time passes, the *dalikas* are deposited only in the remaining time above.

> *Uvarillao dvitiu poggale ghesun udaysameye chova pachiti mitisameye asankhejjguna evam jav antomuhrut.*
>
> *Karma-prakriti Churni*

> *Thai dalie ghettu ghettu asankhan gunaaye. Sahiyadukaranka upma sya gunaseth.*

A small number of *dalik* are placed in the first *udaya* time, an innumerable number of times more *dalik* are placed in the second time above the *udaya* time, an innumerable number of times more *dalik* are placed in the third time, an innumerable number of times more *dalik* are placed in the fourth, fifth, and subsequent times. In this way, an innumerable number of times, an innumerable number of times, *dalik* are established until the last time of the *antarmuhurt* time. This is the method of establishing the *dalik* taken in the first time. Similarly, one should know the method of depositing the *dalik* taken in the remaining second, third, fourth, and subsequent times. This action continues until the times of the *antarmuhurt* time.
Shatak
The summary is that the time of the *gunashreni* is *antarmuhurt*, therefore, *karmadalik* are taken every time from the above situation until the *antarmuhurt*, and the *karmadalik* that are taken every time are established from the *udaya* moment to the last time of the *antarmuhurt* time in an innumerable multiplied order. For example, if the measure of *antarmuhurt* is assumed to be 16 times by imagination, then the *karmadalik* taken in the first time of the *gunashreni* will be established in 16 times in the aforementioned manner. The *karmadalik* taken in the second time will be established in the remaining 15 times only, because the first moment's *vedana* has already happened. The *karmadalik* taken in the third time will be established in the remaining fourteen times only. Similarly, one should understand about the order of the fourth, fifth, and subsequent times, but one should not understand that the *dalik* taken in each time are established in sixteen times only, and in this way the time of the *gunashreni* increases upwards. In this way, *antarmuhurt*

The arrangement of countless multiplied Dalikas, established until the time of the fifth Karmagranya, is called Gunashreni. 
At the time of attaining Samyaktva, the Jiva creates this kind of Gunani structure. Gunani arises from the time of its emergence and countless multiplied Dalikas are established one after another. Therefore, as the Jiva ascends, it continuously sheds countless multiplied, countless multiplied Gunas. The reason for this is that the Dalikas are established in a specific order and they emerge in the same order. They are established in countless multiplied order and emerge in the same order, leading to the shedding of countless multiplied Gunas in Samyaktva. 

After attaining Samyaktva, the Jiva only performs Yathapravritta and Apurvakarana for attaining Deshpirati and Sarvavirati. It does not perform the third, Anivrittikarana, and there is no Gunashreni creation in Apurvakarana. Upon completion of the time of Apurvakarana, Deshvirati or Sarvavirati is definitely attained. This eliminates the need for Anivrittikarana.

If both these Karmas, Yathapravritta and Apurvakarana, are performed continuously, then Deshvirati or Sarvavirati is attained. If they are performed in the state of Deshvirati, then only Sarvavirati is attained. Upon attaining Deshvirati or Sarvavirati, the Jiva creates Gunashreni above the Udayavali. The natures that are Udayavati have Gunashreni from the moment of their emergence. However, in Anudayavati natures, Gunashreni exists from the time after the Udayavali. In the fifth Gunasthan, there is Apratyakhyamarana and in the sixth Gunasthan...

## Chapter 306

**In the case of renunciation of the body, the upward trend of the qualities continues from the time of the previous birth, except for the time of the last birth.**

After attaining liberation from the world and complete liberation, the results of the soul remain increasing for a period of one antarmukhurta, but after that, there is no fixed rule. Some souls continue to have increasing results, some remain in the same state, and some have decreasing results. As long as liberation from the world or complete liberation persists, there is a continuous upward trend of qualities. However, there is a special feature here: in the case of a person who has renounced the world or a person who has renounced all actions, the period of fixed increase in results for one antarmukhurta after the last birth, due to the infinite multiplication of the qualities, creates an upward trend of qualities. After that, if the results continue to increase, the upward trend of qualities sometimes increases by an infinite number of times, sometimes by a finite number of times, sometimes by a finite multiplier, and sometimes by an infinite multiplier. If the results decrease, then the upward trend of qualities decreases in the same way. And in the case of a stable state, the upward trend of qualities remains stable. This means that in the case of increasing results, the number of dālikas increases, in the case of decreasing results, it decreases, and in the case of a stable state, it remains stable. Thus, in liberation from the world and complete liberation, there is a continuous infinite multiplication of the qualities.

**3. The fourth upward trend of qualities is called the disassociation of the infinite attachments.** The disassociation of the infinite attachments of the passions is continuous, with right vision, liberation from the world, and the last birth.

**1. The saints, due to the infinite multiplication of the qualities, increase the time in the same way.** (Panchasangraha 793)

## The Fifth Karma Granth

**307**

And all-ceasing beings do. The non-ceasing right-vision beings take all four types of motion, and the country-ceasing beings are humans and animals, and the all-ceasing beings are only humans.

The being who is striving to detach from the infinite-binding passions, performs the three karmas, namely, the beginning, the middle, and the end. Here, there is a special feature that from the very first moment of the beginning karma, the quality-transfer also starts happening. That is, in the first moment of the beginning karma, a small portion of the infinite-binding passions transfers to the remaining passions. In the second moment, it transfers in an innumerable-fold amount, and in the third moment, it transfers in an innumerable-fold amount of that amount. This process continues until the last moment of the beginning karma, and after that, in the non-beginning karma, the quality-transfer and the boiling-transfer destroy the portions through their process. Thus, in the detachment of the infinite-binding passions, one should know that there are innumerable-fold depletions at every moment.

The destruction of the perception-obscuring karma happens when the human being who is the holder of the eight-year-old Vrishbhanaraach Samhanan, does it after the age of eight years (during the time of the existence of the omniscient). That is, the time for the destruction of the perception-obscuring karma is the existence of the omniscient soul, and the human being who destroys it is the holder of the Vrishbhanaraach Samhanan, and the minimum age is above eight years.

**Four types of motion, three types of binding, and victory over them.**

**The karma-related pacification karma**

**31**

The pacification karma is the last one after the three karmas. The pacification karma is the one that destroys the perception-obscuring karma. It is the one that is fast and quick, and it is the one that is eight years old.

**-Karma-Nature Pacification Karma, 32**

Mataka
Yes. The process of the destruction of Darshanamohiya is similar to the disconnection of the infinite Anubandhi Kashaya. Here too, there are three Karana as before, and in the Apurva Karana, there are actions like Gunauni etc.
The being who ascends the Upshama Dheni also performs the three Karana, Yathapravritta etc., but the difference is that it performs Yathapravritta Karana in the seventh Gunasthan, Apurva Karana in the Gunasthan called Apurva Karana, and Anivritti Karana in the Gunasthan called Anivritti Karana. Here too, as before, there are actions like Sthitighata Gunashreni etc. Therefore, the Upshamaka also destroys Asankhyataguṇi, Asankhyataguṇi in sequence.
After destroying Charitramohiya, the being reaches the eleventh Gunasthan called Upshantamoha and creates Gunashreni. The time of Upshantamoha is Antamuhurta, and in the numbered part of its time, Gunashreni is created, due to which the being also destroys Asankhyataguṇi, Asankhyataguṇi every moment. When the being falls from the eleventh Gunasthan and reaches the sixth Gunasthan and ascends the Kshapaka Shreni, or if it ascends the Kshapaka Shreni directly without ascending the Upshamani, it also performs the three Karana, Yathapravritta Karana, Apurva Karana, and Anivritti Karana, and destroys Asankhyataguṇi from the Upshamaka and Upshantamoha Gunasthan. Similarly, one should understand that the Gunashreni called Kshina Moha, Sayogikevali, and Ayogikevali also destroy Asankhyataguṇi, Asankhyataguṇi in succession.  Although the time of each of these eleven Gunashreni is Antamuhurta-Antamuhurta, the time of Antamuhurta of each is successively less, and the quantity of the destroyed Drasya is Asankhyataguṇi, Asankhyataguṇi from the normal.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

**The गुणश्रेणी (Gunashreni) increases progressively even when the गुण (Gun) is present.** This means that as the results become progressively purer, the destruction of matter occurs more and more rapidly in progressively shorter periods of time.

This is how the **गुणोणि (Gunoni)** is established. From the above discussion of the गुणश्रेणी, it becomes clear that as the जीव (Jiva) progresses through the higher गुणस्थान (Gunasthan), countless **गुणी (Guni)** are destroyed. The higher गुणस्थान are characterized by a gradual decrease in संक्लेश (Sanklesh) and an increase in purity. Therefore, in the following verse, we will explain the difference between the lowest and highest गुणस्थान.

**पलियासंखसमूहू सासणइयरगुण अंतरं हस्त । गुरु मिचछो मे छसट्टी इयरगुणे पुग्गलद्धंतो॥४॥**

**Word Meaning:**

* **पलियासंखसमूह (Paliyasanka Samuh):** An innumerable part of a पल्य (Paly) and अन्तर्मुहूर्त (Antarmuhurt)
* **सासणइयरगुण (Sasana Iyar Gun):** The गुणस्थान of सासादन (Sasadan) and other गुणस्थान
* **अंतरं (Antaram):** Difference
* **हसं (Hasaan):** Lowest
* **गुरु (Guru):** Highest
* **मिन्छी (Minchhi):** Mithyatva
* **छसट्टी (Chhasatti):** Two times sixty-six सागर (Sagar)
* **इपरगुणे (Ipar Gun):** Other गुणस्थान
* **पुग्गलबंतो (Puggala Banto):** Slightly less than half a पुद्गल (Pudgal)

**Verse Meaning:**

The lowest difference between the गुणस्थान of सासादन and other गुणस्थान is an innumerable part of a पल्य and an अन्तर्मुहूर्त. The highest difference in the गुणस्थान of मिथ्यात्व is two times sixty-six सागर, i.e., 132 सागर. The highest difference in other गुणस्थान is slightly less than half a पुद्गल.

**Special Meaning:**

It has already been explained that the names like सम्यक्त्व (Samyaktava), देशविरति (Deshaviriti), etc., of the गुणश्रेणी are essentially गुणस्थान. For example, the place where the सम्यक्त्व गुण manifests is the सम्यक्त्व गुणस्थान, and the place where the देशविरति गुण is strong is the देशविरति गुणस्थान.

The **Shataka** (century) is called the **Gunasthan** (state of qualities) and so on. This should be understood in the same way for the rest. Therefore, because the **Gunashranis** (series of qualities) are related to the **Gunasthanas**, the **Gatha** (verse) has explained the lowest and highest intervals of the **Gunasthanas**. The time it takes for a being to fall from a **Gunasthan** and then regain it is called the **Antarakaal** (interval time) of that **Gunasthan**.

Firstly, explaining the lowest interval of the **Gunasthanas**, it is said that the lowest **Antarakaal** of the second **Gunasthan** called **Sasaadan** is the **Asankhyat** (innumerable) part of a **Paly** (a unit of time) and the interval of the remaining **Gunasthanas** is **Antamuhurt** (a very short time). This is explained here.

The lowest **Antarakaal** of the **Sasaadan Gunasthan** is the **Asankhyat** part of a **Paly** and should be understood as follows: A being with **Mithyadrishti** (false perception) from the beginning, or a being with **Mithyadrishti** from the beginning who has **Udavalana** (overcoming) of **Samyaktvamohaniya** (hindrance to right faith) and **Mithyatvamohaniya** (hindrance to false perception), attains **Aupashmik Samyaktvam** (temporary right faith) and becomes **Sasaadan Samyagdristi** (right faith with complete knowledge) due to the arising of **Anantaanubandhi Kshaya** (infinitely binding passions). This being then falls into the **Mithyatva Gunasthan** (state of false perception). If the same being attains the **Sasaadan Gunasthan** again in the same sequence, it will take at least the **Asankhyat** part of a **Paly** to do so. The reason for this is that when a being falls from the **Sasaadan Gunasthan** into the **Mithyatva Gunasthan**, the **Samyaktvamohaniya** and **Mithyatvamohaniya** still exist. With these two natures present, **Aupashmik Samyaktvam** cannot be attained again, and without attaining **Aupashmik Samyaktvam**, the **Sasaadan Gunasthan** cannot be attained. Therefore, after falling into **Mithyatva**, the being continuously experiences the natures of both **Samyaktvamohaniya** and **Mithyatvamohaniya** karmas.

..

1. **Udavalana** is said to be the overcoming of a nature to transform it into another nature without the three **Karana** (causes) of **Yathapravritti** (natural tendency), **Adi** (beginning), and **Trikala** (three times). 

Page #348:
---------------------------
The fifth Karma Granth, Ubalna, causes both types of Dalikas to continuously transform into Mithyatva and Mohiya forms. 

This continuous Udghaalan leads to the absence of both these types of Prakruti after an immeasurable number of Palyas. Once they are absent, the same Jiva again attains the Upshamia Sampyattva and reaches the Samapan Gunasthan. Therefore, the interval time of the Sasadan Gunasthan is considered to be an immeasurable number of Palyas.

The reason for stating the insignificant interval of the Sasadan Gunasthan as an immeasurable number of Palyas is that a Jiva can fall from the Upsham श्रेणी and reach the Sasadan Gunasthan. After a very short time, it can again climb back to the Upsham श्रेणी and then fall back to the Sasadan Gunasthan. From this perspective, the insignificant interval of Sasadan is very small. However, the attainment of Sasadan Samyattva after falling from the Upsham श्रेणी is only possible in the Manushya Gati, and even there, such an event is very rare. Therefore, it is not discussed here. However, the attainment of Sasadan after falling from the Upsham Samyattva is possible in all four Gatis. Therefore, the insignificant interval of Sasadan is stated as an immeasurable number of Palyas in comparison to this. In other words, the insignificant interval of the Sasadan Gunasthan is stated as an immeasurable number of Palyas, not in comparison to the श्रेणी, but in comparison to falling from the Upsham Samyattva.

Except for Sasadan, the other Gunasthanas, namely Ksheenamoha, Sayogikevali, and Ayogikevali, do not have an interval time because these Gunasthanas are attained once and are not attained again. Among the remaining Gunasthanas, Mithyadristi, Mishradristi, Avirat Sabhyag... 

Page #349:
---------------------------
312
After an infinite number of births, a soul, having fallen from the subtle-perception (Sookshma-Samparaya) and tranquil-delusion (Upashanta-Moha) Gunasthanas of the A-Poorva-Karana, Anivriti-Karana, and Upashma श्रेणी ( श्रेणी )  (categories) of Mataka-Drishti, Desh-Virati, Pramatta, Apramatta, and Upashma, again experiences those deaths. Therefore, their minimum interval is only one Anta-Muhurta. Because when a soul ascends the Upashma श्रेणी ( श्रेणी )  (category) and reaches the eleventh Gunasthana, and then falls from there and descends gradually to the first Mithyatva Gunasthana, and then again reaches the eleventh Gunasthana in one Anta-Muhurta. Because there is a provision for ascending the Upashma श्रेणी ( श्रेणी )  (category) twice in one birth. At that time, the minimum interval of each of the remaining Gunasthanas, except for the mixed Gunasthana, is Anta-Muhurta.
The reason for excluding the mixed Gunasthana is that the soul does not go to the mixed Gunasthana after falling from the श्रेणी ( श्रेणी )  (category). Therefore, when the soul does not ascend the Auni, the minimum interval from Mithya-Drishti to Apramatta Gunasthana, except for the mixed Gunasthana and Sasadan, is Anta-Muhurta. Because these Gunasthanas can be regained after Anta-Muhurta. In this way, one should understand the minimum interval of the Gunasthanas.
Now, while telling the interval of the Gunasthanas in relation to the excellent, first we will tell the interval of the Mithyatva Gunasthana. It is said that Guru Mindi Be Chhasthi - that is, the excellent interval of the Mithyatva Gunasthana is two Chhiya-Sagar, that is, 66 + 66 = 132 Sagars. It is like this: a soul, due to pure results, leaves the Mithyatva Gunasthana and attains Samyaktva. After completing the excellent time of 66 Sagars of Kshayo-Upashma Samyaktva, the soul remains in Samya-Mithyatva for Anta-Muhurta.
1.  "He who has attained the state of emptiness of delusion by the means of Upashma, is free from the bondage of karma."
- Karma Kasi Ga. 64 

Page #350:
---------------------------
The fifth karma granthi (bond) is called **Panchama Karma Granthi**. When a soul departs from there, it attains **Kshayopa-shama** and **Samyak Darshan** (right faith). If it does not attain liberation within 66 **Sagars** (oceans of time), it inevitably falls back into **Mithyatva** (false belief). Thus, the difference between the highest and lowest duration of the **Mithyatva** state is slightly more than 66 Sagars, or 132 Sagars.

The difference between the highest and lowest duration of the remaining **Gunasthanas** (states of being) from **Sasa-dana** to **Upashanta-moha** is slightly less than half a **Pudal Paravarta** (a unit of time). This is because a soul, after falling from these **Gunasthanas**, wanders in the cycle of birth and death for a period slightly less than half a **Pudal Paravarta**, and then again attains those **Gunasthanas**. Therefore, the difference between the highest and lowest duration of these **Gunasthanas** is considered to be slightly less than half a **Pudal Paravarta**.

The reason why there is no difference between **Kshina-moha**, **Sayogika-kevali**, and **Ayogika-kevali** **Gunasthanas** has been explained earlier. Once attained, these **Gunasthanas** are not lost again. This means that once these **Gunasthanas** are attained, they do not decay, eliminating the need to consider the highest or lowest duration.

After explaining the highest and lowest duration of **Gunasthanas**, the next verses will elaborate on the nature of **Palyopam** and **Ardha-Pudal Paravarta** in the context of the duration of time. First, the nature of **Palyopam** will be explained.

**Verse 8:**

> **Uddharam-ashakhita-pali-ya tiha samaya-vasa-sayasam-aye.**
> **Fesa-vaharo vi-vo-hi-a-un-saha-pari-mana.**

This is also explained in the **Pancha-Sangraha** (five collections) regarding the difference between **Gunasthanas**.

**Verse 5:**

> **Pali-ya-san-kho sa-sa-yana-tara-se-sa-yana-manta-muh.**
> **Mis-sa be chha-sat-ti i-para-na-po-ggasa-vato.**

Narada
**Word Meaning:** Umaarakhita - liberation, Adda and Kshetra - half and field, Palipalpalyopam - comparison with a moment, Tiha - three types. Samayavasasayasa-mae - time, hundred years and in me, Kesavaharo - hair-tip, Bichopahi - island and ocean, Aajatasaai - lifespan and Prasadhi Jivas. Parimanam - quantity, calculation. 
**Meaning:** Liberation, half and field, thus there are three types of Palypalyopam. In them, in sequence, one moment, in a hundred years and in one moment, a hair-tip is used as a comparison. By which, in sequence, islands, oceans, lifespan and Prasadhi Jivas are calculated. 
**Special Meaning:** In this verse, the types of Palypalyopam, their nature and their use are briefly instructed. In the world, things that can be easily counted and as far as the field of mathematics is concerned, it is easy to calculate, but beyond that, the tendency is towards comparison. For example, sesame seeds, mustard seeds, wheat etc. grains cannot be counted, so they are measured by weight or measurement etc. Similarly, the period of time that can be counted in terms of years is calculated and for that, in the scriptures, Purvaang, Purva etc. are considered as names, but even after that, the period of time is so long that it cannot be calculated in years. Therefore, the help of comparison is taken. There are two types of comparison: Palypalyopam and Samaropama.
The long period of time is compared to a moment, the circular space filled with one Anapa etc. is called a Palp. 

Page #352:
---------------------------
The fifth karma-pranya is called palyopama kala. There are three types of palyopama: uddharaddhakhittan palya-uddhar palyopama, addha palyopama and kshetra palyopama. Similarly, there are three types of sagaropama kala: uddhar sagaropama, addha sagaropama and kshetra sagaropama. Each of these palyopama and sagaropama is of two types: badar and sukshma. Their nature will be explained further.

In verses 40 and 41, while explaining the evidence of kshudra bhava, the ancient time calculation is briefly mentioned, mentioning the evidence of time, avalika, sacchabas, pran, stoka, lava and muhurta. After that, one day and night is 30 muhurta, one paksha is 15 days, one month is two paksha, one ritu is two months, one ayan is three ritu, one year is two ayan, and certain numbers of years are known as yuga, shatabdi, etc. The names given to them in ancient times, according to the Anuogadwar Sutra, are as follows: 84 lakh years is one purvaang, 84 lakh purvaang is one purva, 24 lakh purva is trutitang, 84 lakh trutitang is one trutit, 84 lakh trutit is one addang, 84 lakh addang is one addad. Similarly, in order, avang, avak, huh ang, huhu, utpalang, utpal, padmang, patra, nalinaang, nalin, arthanimuraang, arthanimpur, ayutang, ayut, prayutang, pramut, nayutang, nayut, chulikang, chulica, shirshaprahelikang, shirshaprahe. lika, these are all multiplied by 84 lakh. By mentioning these names,

1. Anuogadwar Sutra has made a distinction between sukshma and vyavaharik.
2. These names are according to the Anuogadwar Sutra (verse 127, mantra 138). According to Jyotishk Rand, their number is as follows: 84 lakh
(See next page for the rest)

316 Further it is written - 'Eyaavaya cheva ganie eyaavaya cheva ganiassa visaaye, etto'avaram ovamie pattai.'' That is, the amount of 194 digits that is produced by multiplying the Shooshaprahelika, is the extent of the mathematics, that much amount is the subject of mathematics. Beyond that, the tendency of the Upamā Pramaana occurs.

To explain the Upamā Pramaana, the example of the Balaga has been taken as the basis. The first name is Uddharapalya, whose form is this:
A Latag of the East, a Latā of 84 lakh Lasang, a Mahalatang of 84 lakh Lasā, a Mahasatā of 84 lakh Mahalatang, in the same way, further Malinaang, Nalin, Mahanalinaang, Mahanalin, Papang, Pap, Mahapaang, Mahapam, Kamalaang, Kamal, Mahakamalaang, Mahakamal, Kumudaang, Kumud, Mahakumudaang, Mahakumuva, Trutitaang, Tit, Mahatr Titog, Mahatru Rit, Addadaang, Ad, Mahaaddadaang, Mahasarad, Ahaang, Kah, Mahamahaag, Mahauh, Porshaprahelikaang and Shirshaprahelika. (Gatha 14-71)

The reason for the difference in the names mentioned in the Anuyogadwarsutra and Jyotishkaranda has been explained in the Kalalokaprakash as follows - 'Anuyogadwar, Jambudvipapraapti etc. are followed by the Mathura recitation and Jyotishkaranda etc. are followed by the Valmi recitation, hence the difference in both.

The Digambar text Tattvarthrajavartika has given the names Purvaag, Purva, Nayutaang, Nayut, Kumudaang, Kumud, Paang, Pan, Nalinaang, Nalin, Kamalaang, Kamal, Tutyang Tutm, Attatang, Attat, Amamaang Amaam, Huhu Ang, Huhu, Latang, Latā, Mahalatā etc. All these names are formed by multiplying 84 lakh by 84 lakh. In this method of multiplication, the Shwetambar and Digambar texts are of one opinion. 1 Anuyogawar Sutra 137

It is said that through the "Utsedha Angul" gate, one should construct a circular "Palyagardha" (fortress) made of "Vishnan" (a type of stone), one "Yojan" (unit of distance) wide and one "Yojan" deep, with a circumference slightly less than 31 "Yojan". This "Paly" should be filled tightly with hairs that have grown in a single day to seven days, so that neither fire can burn them, nor wind can blow them away, nor water can enter it. From this "Paly", one hair should be removed at a time. The time it takes for this "Paly" to become empty is called "Badar Uddhar Paly". 

Ten "Kotakoti" (ten billion) "Badar Uddhar Palyopam" (a unit of time) make one "Badar Uddhar Sagaropama" (another unit of time).

The purpose of these "Badar Uddhar Palyopam" and "Badar Uddhar Sagaropama" is to make the understanding of the subtle "Uddhar Palyopam" and "Uddhar Sagaropama" easier.

"Asmimmirupite sukshmam subodham ayudharapi. Aso nirupitam nanyarikachidasy prayojanam." - Dravyalokaprakash 1.86

There are three types of "Angul" (unit of measurement): "Asmangul", "Utsedha Angul", and "Pramana Angul". Their explanation is given further. 

The "Anuyogadwar Sutra" and other texts related to filling the "Paly" with hairs are discussed in the appendix. 

The "Dravyalokaprakash" (a Jain text) explains in detail in verse 1582 about filling the "Paly" tightly:

"Tatha cha chakrisanyena tamakramya prasapta.
Na manak kriyate nicharevam nibhidatagam."

These hairs are so tightly packed that even if the army of a Chakravarti (universal monarch) marches over them, they will not move even slightly downwards.

## 310
## Century

Now we will explain the nature of the subtle liberation-atom-simile and the liberation-ocean-simile. To divide each hair-tip of the liberation-atom into countless, countless pieces by one's own intellect. These pieces are so subtle compared to a hair that they are countless times smaller than the smallest particle of matter that a very pure-minded man can see with his eyes. And compared to the area that the body of a subtle-perceiving living being occupies, they are countless times smaller than the area that a subtle-perceiving living being occupies. These hair-tips should be packed tightly into the liberation-atom as before. As before, if one removes one piece of the hair-tip at a time, it will take countless crores of years for the liberation-atom to be emptied. Therefore, that period of time is called the subtle liberation-atom-simile. Ten subtle liberation-atom-similes make one subtle liberation-ocean-simile.

The islands and oceans are counted by these subtle liberation-atom-similes and subtle liberation-ocean-similes. There are as many islands and oceans as there are periods of time in two and a half subtle liberation-ocean-similes, or twenty-five koṭakoṭi subtle liberation-atom-similes.

What is the purpose of these subtle liberation-atom-similes and liberation-ocean-similes? The liberation of islands and oceans takes place in these subtle liberation-atom-similes and liberation-ocean-similes. How many, sir? The islands and oceans... ... "As many as there are periods of time in two and a half liberation-ocean-similes."

-Anuyogadār Sūtra 138

1. In the commentary of the *Viśeṣāvaśyaka Bhāṣya* by Koṭyācārya (p. 210), the meaning of *parfa* is given as "a particular plant". In the commentary of the *Pravachanasārōddhār*, it is stated that its subtle perception is equal to the body of the earth-body of the *bādar* *paryāptak*.

**Badar Adhapalyopama:**  The time taken for a Badar Udgharpalya to become empty by removing one hair every hundred years is called Badar Adhapalyopama Kala. Ten Koti Koti Badar Adhapalyopama Kala makes one Badar Kala.

**Sookshma Udgharpalya:** The time taken for a Sookshma Udgharpalya to become empty by removing one hair tip every hundred years is called Sookshma Adhapalyopama Kala. Ten Koti Koti Sookshma Adhapalyopama Kala makes one Sookshma Adhasagaropama Kala. Ten Koti Koti Sookshma Adhasagaropama Kala makes one Avasarpini and one Utsarpini. Through these Sookshma Adhapalyopama and Sookshma Adhasagaropama, the lifespan, karma, and other details of Devas, humans, animals, Narakas, and Naras are known.

**What is the significance of these Adhapalyopama and Adhasagaropama?** These Adhapalyopama and Adhasagaropama are used to calculate the lifespan of humans, Devas, and animals, as well as the duration of the Avasarpini and Utsarpini periods.

**Badar Kshetrapalyopama:** Fill a pit one Yojana long, wide, and deep with the tips of hair that have grown for one to seven days. The time taken to remove all the hair tips from the pit, one by one, is called Badar Kshetrapalyopama Kala. This time is equal to countless Utsarpini and Avasarpini Kalas. Ten Koti Koti Badar Kshetrapalyopama Kala makes one Badar Kshetrasagaropama Kala. 

Page #357:
---------------------------
Fill each of the countless fragments of the Badar Kshetrapaly's Balanas into the same pulp as before. In that pulp, those fragments occupy regions of the sky, and the Jina, the omniscient, takes away one region at a time, from birth. The time it takes to take away all the regions, both manifest and unmanifest, is called a **Sookshma Kshetrapalyopam Kala**. Ten Koti Koti **Sookshma Kshetrapalyopam** make up one **Sookshma Kshetrasagropam**. Through these **Sookshma Kshetrapalyopam** and **Sookshma Kshetrasagropam**, the concept of the measure of substances in **Drishtivad** is considered, as well as the measure of the six Kayas: Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Plants, and Trisas, in **Drishtivad**.

What is the purpose of these **Kshetrapalyasagropam**? In **Drishtivad**, substances do not exist in these **Kshetrapalyasagropam**.

... In the **Anuyogadwar Sutra 14**, the inquisitive asks about the nature of **Sookshma Kshetrapalyopam Kala**. If all the manifest and unmanifest regions of the sky are taken away by the Balanas, then what is the purpose of the Balanas? Because in that case, the purpose is fulfilled by taking away all the regions within the aforementioned pulp. The solution is that the **Kshetrapalyopam** is used to consider the measure of substances in **Drishtivad**. The measure of some substances is measured by the manifest regions of the sky through the aforementioned Balanas, and the measure of some substances is measured by the unmanifest regions of the sky. Therefore, the instruction of the Balanas is purposeful, not purposeless, because they are useful in the measure of substances described in **Drishtivad**.

"The use of the substance mentioned in the *Dristivada* is for the purpose of forming a shape like the tip of a finger, as it is useful here." - *Anuyogadvara Tika*, page 163, Explanation of the divisions of the Angula.

In the context of explaining the nature of the *Uddharapalya* simile, the *Utsegha Angula* was used to indicate the creation of a pit-like *palya* that is one *yojana* long, wide, and deep. In the investigation of this, the *Atma Angula*, *Utsegha Angula*, and *Pramana Angula* - these three divisions of the *Angula* have been explained. Here, their nature is explained.

*Atma Angula* - ...one's own *Angura* is formed, or the height of one's own body is 108 *Angula* in measure. That *Angula* is called the *Atma Angula*. The measure of this *Angula* is not always the same, because the height of human bodies increases and decreases due to differences in time.

*Utsegha Angula* - The *Paramanu* is of two types - one is the *Nischya Paramanu* and the other is the *Vyavahara Paramanu*. An infinite number of *Nischya Paramanu* make up one *Vyavahara Paramanu*. Although that *Vyavahara Paramanu* is actually a *Skandha*, it is called a *Paramanu* from a practical point of view, because it is so subtle that even the sharpest weapon cannot pierce or break it. Still, it has been considered the root cause for measurement. It is like this - an infinite number of *Vyavahara Paramanu* make up one *Unashlakshna-Shlakshnika*, and eight *Unashlakshna-Shlakshnika* make up one *Shlakshna-Shlakshnika*. Eight *Shlakshna-Shlakshnika* make up one...

*Jivasamaas* - In urine, an infinite number of *Janashala-Palakshnika* make up one *Shlakshna-Shlakshnika*.

It has been established that one *Shlakshna-Shlakshnika* is made up of an infinite number of *Janashala-Palakshnika*, but in the *Agamas*, it has been stated as eightfold in many places. Therefore, here too, it has been accepted according to the *Agamas*.

*Pramanangul* is two and a half times wider than *Utsedhangul* and four hundred times longer. The *Atmangul* of Bharat Chakravarti at the beginning of the *Yuga* should be known as *Pramanangul*.
In Digambar literature, the measure of *Angul* is described as follows:
Infinitely small *Paramanu* make one *Utsanjnasanjna*, eight *Utsanjnasanjna* make one *Sanjnasanjna*, eight *Sanjnasanjna* make one *Luṭireṇu*, eight *Luṭireṇu* make one *Trasareṇu*, eight *Trasareṇu* make one *Rathreṇu*, eight *Rathreṇu* make one *Balagra* of a human in *Uttarakuru* and *Devakuru*, eight *Balagra* make one *Balagra* of a human in *Ramyak* and *Harivarsha*, eight *Balagra* make one *Balagra* of a human in *Haimavat* and *Hairanyavat*, eight *Balagra* make one *Balagra* of a human in *Bharat*, *Airavat* and *Videha*, and then *Likh*, *Yuka*, etc.

The measure should be understood as before. The measure of an angula is five hundred times the measure of an utsedha angula. This is the atma angula of Bharat Chakravarti.

In this way, one should know the differences and nature of the palya upamas. Earlier, the excellent difference between the gunasthana like sasadan etc. was told to be slightly less than half a pudgala paravarta. Therefore, now in the next three verses, we will clarify the nature of pudgala paravarta.

**Verse 6:**
> When a child is born, it is like a small seed. It is like a small drop of ghee. The pudgala paravarta is like the size of an ant.

**Verse 87:**
> A single jiva, by its seven types of karmas, leaves behind all the atoms it touches. The amount of pudgala paravarta left behind is like a small amount of dust.

**Verse 88:**
> The pudgala paravarta left behind by a jiva is like a small part of a drop of ghee. It is like a small amount of dust that is left behind when a pot is broken.

**Word Meanings:**

* **Dabbe:** related to dravya
* **Khite:** related to kshetra
* **Kale:** related to kala
* **Bhaave:** related to bhava
* **Vajah:** two types
* **Bayro:** badar
* **Suomo:** subtle
* **Hoi:** is
* **Anantussappiniparimaano:** the measure of the infinite utsarpini and avasarpini
* **Puggalparatttho:** pudgala paravarta
* **Urlaaisattgeṇam:** by the seven types of karmas like odarik
* **Egajij:** one jiva
* **Muyai:** leaves behind
* **Phusiy:** touching
* **Sammannu:** all atoms
* **Jatiyakali:** in the time
* **Sa:** that much
* **Yulo:** gross, badar
* **Badhye:** dravya pudgala paravarta
* **Suomo:** subtle dravya pudgala paravarta
* **Samannara:** by one of the seven types of karmas

Special Note: In Jain literature, every topic is discussed in relation to dravya, kshetra, kala and bhava. Here, the pudgala paravarta is being stated in relation to these four aspects. Paravarta means change, alteration, reversal, etc. Here, dravya refers to...

The **pudgala** substance has been taken. Because, firstly, the word **pudgala** is attached to every change, and its four divisions, **dravya-pudgala**, **paravarta**, etc., have been explained. Secondly, the **pudgala** substance is the cause of the soul's wandering in the world. The soul cannot exist without it in the worldly state. Therefore, the smallest atom-particle of **pudgala** is considered here as the **dravya** element. The space in which that atom fits is called **kṣetra**, and that **kṣetra** is a part of the **loka-ākāśa**, because the soul resides in the **loka-ākāśa**. The time it takes for one atom of **pudgala** to travel from one **kṣetra** to another adjacent **kṣetra** is called **kāla**. This is the smallest part of time. Here, **bhāva** refers to the **kṣaya**-shaped **bhāva** that is the cause of **anubhāga-bandha**. These changes in **dravya**, **kṣetra**, **kāla**, and **bhāva** are considered as four changes.

Although, except for **dravya-pudgala-paravarta**, there is no change in **pudgala** in any other **paravarta**, because in **kṣetra-pudgala-paravarta** there is a change in **kṣetra**, in **kāla-pudgala-paravarta** there is a change in **kāla**, and in **bhāva-pudgala-paravarta** there is a change in **bhāva**, but the time of **pudgala-paravarta** is said to be equal to the infinite **utsarpini** and **avsarpiṇī** time, and the time of **kṣetra**, **kāla**, and **bhāva-paravarta** is also infinite **utsarpini** and infinite **avsarpiṇī**, therefore, these **paravartas** are named **pudgala-paravarta**.

The time taken for the **pudgalas** (atoms) to change by way of **osarika** transformation, or by way of the desired body form, or by way of their collective transformation, is called **pudgala-paravarta**. This is the cause of the **śambha**'s origin, and by this cause of origin,

## Chapter 326

When a living being, through repeated deaths, experiences all the atoms of pudgala one by one, and through death in every region of space, experiences all the regions of space, then it is called **Dravya Pudgala Paravarta**. Similarly, one should understand the **Kala** and **Bhaava Pudgala Paravarta**.

It is clear that since the living being has been wandering in this world from time immemorial, there is not a single atom left that it has not experienced, not a single region of space where it has not died, not a single moment of the ascending and descending time remaining in which it has not died, and not a single place of attachment left where it has not died. It has experienced all those atoms, regions, times, and places of attachment many times through its death. Keeping this in mind, the time has been divided into **Dravya Pudgala Paravarta** etc. and the measure of time in which the **Pudgala Paravarta** occurs is called by the name of that **Pudgala Paravarta**.

Therefore, the author has described here the four divisions of **Pudgala Paravarta**: **Dravya**, **Kshetra**, **Kala**, and **Bhaava**.

The verse hints at the knowledge of the time of **Pudgala Paravarta** by stating that it is **"Ananta Utsarpini and Ananta Avasarpini Kala"**.

**"Swakartha Samavayi Pravritti Nimitta Mananta Utsarpini Avasarpini Maanaswaroop Lakshyaate. Tena Kshetra Pudgala Paravartiau Pudgala Paravartana Aabhave Api Pratinimitta Sthananta Utsarpini Avasarpini Maanaswaroopasya Vidhyamanatvat Pudgala Paravarta Sharadah Pravartmano Na Viruddha Yate."** (Pravachan Tee, Page 300)

It is equal. That is, there is a **pudgala paravarta** for both infinite **utsarpini** and infinite **avsarpiṇī** time.

There are four types of **pudgala paravarta**: **dravya pudgala paravarta**, **kṣetra pudgala paravarta**, **kāla pudgala paravarta**, and **bhāva pudgala paravarta**. Each of these four types has two sub-types: **bādar** and **sūkṣma**. That is, the **pudgala paravarta** is infinite **utsarpini** and infinite **avsarpiṇī** in duration, and **dravya**, **kṣetra**, **kāla**, and **bhāva** are the four fundamental types. These fundamental types are also of two types each, **bādar** and **sūkṣma**. Their characteristics are explained below.

First, we will explain the nature of **bādar** and **sūkṣma dravya pudgala paravarta**.

**Dravya Pudgala Paravarta** - It has been explained earlier that the **lok** is filled with various types of **pudgala** classifications, and out of these classifications, eight types are **grahaṇayogya** (capable of being grasped) by the **jīva**. The **jīva** grasps these classifications and uses them to create its body, mind, speech, etc. These classifications are:

1. **Audārika grahaṇayogya** classification
2. **Vaikriya grahaṇayogya** classification
3. **Āhārak grahaṇayogya** classification
4. **Tejas grahaṇayogya** classification
5. **Bhāṣā grahaṇayogya** classification
6. **Śvāsochchvāsa grahaṇayogya** classification
7. **Mano grahaṇayogya** classification
8. **Kārmaṇa grahaṇayogya** classification

In the time it takes for a **jīva** to experience all the **paramāṇus** of the **audārika**, **vaikriya**, **tejas**, **bhāṣā**, **ānāprāṇa**, **mano**, and **kārmaṇa** classifications, except for the **āhārak grahaṇayogya** classification, and to transform them into its body, mind, speech, etc., and then abandon them... 

Page #365:
---------------------------
A **Shataka** is the time taken for all the atoms to be consumed and discarded by a living being in all seven forms except the Aharaka form. This is called **Badar Dravyapudgala Paravarta**. 

The time taken for all the atoms to be consumed and discarded by a living being in only one form is called **Sookshma Dravyapudgala Paravarta**.

In essence, **Badar Dravyapudgala Paravarta** involves the consumption and discarding of all atoms in seven forms, excluding the Aharaka form, while **Sookshma Dravyapudgala Paravarta** involves the consumption and discarding of atoms in only one form.

It is important to note that if, during the transformation of all atoms into an Audarika body, some atoms are discarded in the form of a Vaikriya body, or if all atoms are discarded in the form of a Vaikriya body, or if, during the transformation of all atoms into a Vaikriya body, some atoms are discarded in the form of an Audarika body, then these are not counted. Only the atoms that are consumed and discarded in the form of the body that is currently undergoing transformation are considered in **Sookshma Dravyapudgala Paravarta**.

The reason for excluding the Aharaka body is that a living being can only have an Aharaka body a maximum of four times. Therefore, it is not useful in **Pudgala Paravarta**.

**-Pravachan Deeka, p. 308, S. 2**

In this **Sookshma Dravyapudgala Paravarta**, the atoms consumed and discarded in forms other than the intended body are not counted. However, even after a long period of time, the atoms that are transformed into the intended body form are counted.

### Regarding the Matter-Pudgala Transformation

Some Acharyas hold the view that:

"**Av imo dadhyai orala vijayate kamme hi. Nisesadavy gahanammi bayaro hoi paryo.**"

Other Acharyas explain the nature of Matter-Pudgala transformation as follows:

"When a Jiva, through its Audarik, Vaikriya, Tejas and Karman bodies, which are the four types of Asana bodies, transforms and releases all the Pudgalas in the world, then it is called **Badar Dravya-Pudgala Paravarti**. When a Jiva, through one of the four bodies, transforms and releases all the Pudgalas, while the remaining Pudgalas are not taken, then it is called **Sookshma Dravya-Pudgala Paravarti**."

- The time taken to release all the Pudgala atoms by taking them in the form of Audarik, Vaikriya, Tejas and Karman bodies is called **Badar Dravya-Pudgala Paravarti**. The time taken to release all the Pudgala atoms by transforming them into one of the four bodies is called **Sookshma Dravya-Pudgala Paravarti**.

After explaining the nature of both Badar and Sookshma Dravya-Pudgala Paravarti, we will now explain the nature of Kshetra, Kala and Bhava-Pudgala Paravarti. Like Dravya-Pudgala Paravarti, there are two types of each: Sookshma and Badar.

Generally, the time taken by a Jiva to traverse all the regions of the Lokakasha is...

## Translation:

Touching the **kṣetra-pudgala** by death means the death of a being in all the regions of space during the **utsarpini** and **avsarpiṇī** periods. Touching all the **kṣaya-sthāna** (afflictions) that are the cause of **anubhāga-bandha** (bond of experience) by death is called **kāla** and **bhāva-pudgala-parāvṛtti** respectively. Their detailed explanation is as follows:

**Mataka**

**Kṣetra-pudgala-parāvṛtti:** A being travels and dies in one region of space, then dies in another region of space, then in a third, fourth, and so on. When it dies in all the regions of space, that period of time is called **bādar** or **kṣetra-pudgala-parāvṛtti**. In **bādar** **kṣetra-pudgala-parāvṛtti**, it is sufficient to touch all the regions of space in any order, whether sequential or not.

**Sūkṣma kṣetra-pudgala-parāvṛtti:** In **sūkṣma kṣetra-pudgala-parāvṛtti**, the regions of space are also touched, but its characteristic is that a being travels and dies in one region of space, then dies in another region adjacent to it, then in a third region adjacent to that one. In this way, it dies in each region in succession until it has died in all the regions of space. This is called **sūkṣma kṣetra-pudgala-parāvṛtti**.

The summary of the above statement and the difference between **bādar** and **sūkṣma kṣetra-pudgala-parāvṛtti** is that in **bādar**, the order is not considered. If a being dies in a region that has not been touched before, it is considered to have been touched. In other words, it is considered sufficient to die in all the regions, whether sequentially or not. However, in **sūkṣma**, the being must die in all the regions sequentially.

The regions where death occurs or where rebirth occurs in the previous place of death are not counted. This clarifies that the time taken for the subtle field-pudgala transformation is more than that for the gross. The time for the gross is less, and the time for the subtle is more.

Regarding the subtle field-pudgala transformation, one should know that the lowest state of a living being is said to be an immeasurable part of the Jghana Avagaha Lok. Although a living being cannot stay in one region of the Lokakara, if the father fills a Dasha, then one region of that country is considered as the base. Therefore, if death occurs in any region far from that desired region, it is not counted. However, after an infinite time, when death occurs in the region that follows the desired region, it is counted.

Regarding the acceptance of regions, some Acharyas believe that all the regions of the Lokakasha where death occurs are accepted, and no intermediate desired region is accepted.

Others explain that all the regions of the sky where the deep-rooted living being dies are counted, not just one desired region of the sky in the middle.

- Pravachana Teeka, page 30, Kaspurgal Paravarta - The time in which a living being dies in all the times of the descending and ascending cycles, either in a lesser or non-sequential manner, is called the gross time-pudgala transformation. And if a living being dies in the first time of a desired descending cycle, then dies in the second time near it, then dies in the third time, then...

**Fatal**

The term "**Sookshma Kalpudgal Paravart**" refers to the time taken by a being to die in all the **Aavipini** and **Utsarpini** **Kal** (time periods) within a **Mav** (cycle).

Just like in the case of **Kshetra** (space), the calculation of time should be done sequentially, not randomly. This means that if a being dies in the first **Kal** of **Avasarpini** (descending time period), and then dies again in the second **Kal** of **Avasarpini** after the completion of one **Kal** of **Bos Kodakodi Sagropam** (a specific time period), then it is considered as the second **Kal** in the calculation. Even if the being dies in the remaining **Kal** in between, it is not considered. If the being does not die in the second **Kal** of the said **Avasarpini** but dies in other **Kal**, then those are also not considered. However, after the completion of infinite **Utsarpini** and **Avasarpini**, if the being dies in the second **Kal** of **Avasarpini**, then that **Kal** is considered. Similarly, one should understand the third, fourth, fifth, and so on **Kal** in the same way. The time taken by a being to die sequentially in all the **Kal** of **Utsarpini** and **Avasarpini** is called **Sookshma Kalpudgal Paravart**.

**Mavpudgal Paravart** - The number of **Anubhagbandha Sthan** (stages of bondage), **Kshaya Sthan** (stages of liberation), and **Tartam Bhed** (subtle differences) are equal to the number of **Lokakasha** (space of the universe), which is infinite. The time taken by a being to die in all the **Anubhagbandha Sthan** sequentially, starting from the lowest or randomly, is called **Badar Bhavpudgal Paravart**. If a being dies in the lowest **Anubhagbandha Sthan**, then dies in the next **Anubhagbandha Sthan**, then in the next one, and so on, and finally dies in all the **Anubhagbandha Sthan** sequentially, then it is called **Sookshma Bhavpudgal Paravart**.

**Magraj**

_In the case of both **Bādar** and **Sūkṣma** **Bhāvapudgala** **Pāravats**, just like other **Pāravats**, one should understand this difference: When a being dies in the most despicable **Anubhāgabandhasthāna** and after an infinite period of time, when it dies in the second **Anubhāgabandhasthāna** following the first **Anubhāgabandhasthāna**, then this death is counted in the **Sūkṣma** **Bhāvapudgala** **Pāravart**, but the infinite infinite deaths that occur due to **Akram** are not counted. Similarly, when it dies in the third **Anubhāgabandhasthāna** following the second **Anubhāgabandhasthāna** after a long time, then that death is counted. The same order should be understood for the fourth, fifth, etc. places. That is, in **Bādar**, deaths occurring in any way, whether **Kram** or **Akram**, are counted, while in **Sūkṣma**, only deaths occurring in **Kram** are counted._

_In this way, the nature of **Bādar** and **Sūkṣma** **Pudgala** **Pāravats** is explained. In the same way, the nature, difference, etc. of the four **Pudgala** **Pāravats**, including **Dravya**, are described in **Pañcasangraha** 2137-41. Those verses are as follows:_

_**Poggala parithatto iha davai chaviho muṇeyacho. Ekkeko puṇ duviho bāyaramuhammatabhēeṇam. Samsārami aḍato jāv ya kāleṇ phusiya sachvāṇ. Igu jo muyai bāyar agnay ratanuṣṭiho suhumo.

Aṇubhāgaṭhāṇemu aṇantaraparampravībhattīhi. Bhāvammi bāyari so muhumo madhyemanukramaso.**_

_(In **Digambara** literature, the description of **Pāravartī** is different. See the appendix for that description.)_

Now, the masters of the Uttar and Jana Pradeshbandha explain the general principle.
Appayarapdiyango ukfa bogo ya sanipassatto. Kunai paesukkosan mahalayam tassa bachase ||6||
Word Meaning- Appayarapashbindi- binder of lesser natures, upakaranogi- possessor of excellent yoga, 4-and, sanipassaso- sufficiently aware, kunah does, paesukkosan- excellent binding of regions, jahan yam- inferior region binding, sassa- his, bacchale- by contrast.
Gapaarsh- The possessor of excellent yoga, who binds lesser natures, and the sufficiently aware being, binds the excellent Pradeshbandha. And conversely, the possessor of inferior yoga, who binds many natures, and the insufficiently aware being, binds the inferior Pradeshbandha. In particular, this verse states the one who binds the excellent Pradeshbandha and the one who binds the inferior Pradeshbandha. The one who binds the lesser number of root and Uttar natures, binds the excellent Pradeshbandha. Because, due to the lesser number of karma natures, each nature gets more Pradesh. Therefore, the binder of lesser natures, the possessor of excellent yoga, and the sufficiently aware being, binds the excellent Pradeshbandha. And in the opposite situation, i.e., when the binders of more natures have their karmadalikas divided into more parts (natures), each gets less Pradesh. Therefore, the binder of more natures, the possessor of slow yoga, and the insufficiently aware being, binds the inferior Pradeshbandha. This is explained below. 

Page #372:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma Granth

*
In the context of stating the characteristics of those who possess excellent and inferior *pradeshabandha*, the following points are highlighted:

1. Just as it is necessary to have fewer partners for obtaining a larger share of wealth, similarly, the one who performs excellent *pradeshabandha* should bind fewer *prakritis*. Because it has been explained in the division of previous karmas that whatever *jikas* are present in a *raman*, they are all divided into the *prakritis* that are bound at that time. Therefore, if the number of *prakritis* to be bound is large, they will receive small *pradeshas* during the division, and if the number of *prakritis* is small, they will receive larger *dalikas* during the division.

2. Just as it is necessary to have a high income for greater gains, similarly, the one who performs excellent *pradeshabandha* should possess excellent *yoga*. Because the cause of *pradeshabandha* is *yoga*, and if *yoga* is intense, there will be a connection with a larger number of *karmadalikas* to the soul, and if *yoga* is weak, there will also be a decrease in the number of *karmadalikas*. Therefore, the presence of excellent *yoga* is stated for excellent *pradeshabandha* - *ukkad jogi*.

3-4. The third requirement for the one who possesses excellent *pradeshabandha* is that they should be a *sanjni* and *paryaptak*. Because an *aparyaptak* being is one with a short lifespan and limited power, they cannot perform excellent *pradeshabandha*. Along with being *paryaptak*, they should also be *sanjni*. Because even if they are *paryaptak* but not *sanjni*, they cannot perform excellent *pradeshabandha*. The power of an *asanjni* being is also incomplete.

Patak
Therefore, in the context of stating the ownership of the excellent Pradeshbandha, the three significant adjectives 'Ukkadjogee' and 'Sannipajjatto' are given in the verse to explain that excellent Pradeshbandha occurs when there is excellent Yoga, and Sanjee Paryaptak is the excellent Yoga. Although verses 53-54, while explaining the scarcity of Yogas, have stated that the subtle Nigodhya Labdhya Paryaptak is the most inferior and Sanjee Paryaptak is the most excellent Yoga. Therefore, by saying 'Ukkadjogee', the understanding of Sanjee Paryaptak is already conveyed, but for more clarity, the two terms 'Sannipajjatto' are used. When there is excellent Yoga, many beings take on many natures. However, it is necessary for a few natures to be blind along with excellent Yoga.

Conversely, if someone binds many natures, the Yoga is also slow and insufficient, and is not Sanjee, then he performs the inferior Pradeshbandha. In this way, one should know about the ownership of the general, excellent, and inferior Pradeshbandha. _Now, the owners of the excellent Pradeshbandha are explained in relation to the original and the answering natures.

Miccha Ajaychau Aau Bitigun Vinu Mohi Satt Micchai Chanhham Satras Suhmo Ajayadesa Biliksae. ||6||

The same qualifications of the owner of the excellent and inferior Pradeshbandha are explained in Panchasamyaha and Go. Karmakanda as well. For example:

Appasarpagabandhe Uskadjogee U Sannipajjatto. || Kunai Paesukkosan Jahanayam Tassa Vacchaase. - Panchasangraha 268
Ukkadjogee Sannipajjatto Payadib Dhammapadaro. Kunadi Paye Sukkasan Jpanae Jaan Divariyam. || Go. Karmakanda 210

**Word Meanings:**

* **Michch:**  Mithyatva (false belief)
* **Ajaychau:**  Avirat Samyak Darshan (uninterrupted right faith) and the other four Gunasthanas (stages of spiritual progress)
* **Aam:**  Aayu Karma (life-span karma)
* **Vitigunavinnu:**  Without the second and third Gunasthanas
* **Mohi:**  Mohaniya Karma (attachment karma)
* **Satt:**  Seven Gunasthanas
* **Milaai:**  Mithyatva (false belief) and other (five)
* **Chhe:**  Six (original) natures
* **Sataras:**  Seventeen (natures)
* **Sahmi:**  Sukshma Samparaya Gunasthana (the tenth Gunasthana)
* **Amma:**  Avirat Sammasthrit (uninterrupted right conduct)
* **Sa-Gaviriti:**  With Deshavirati (freedom from attachment to place)
* **Ritikasay:**  The second and third Kashayas (passions)

**Verse Meaning:**

Those with Mithyatva (false belief) and the four Gunasthanas of Avirat (uninterrupted) and others, perform the highest level of binding of Aayu Karma (life-span karma).  Those with Mithyatva (false belief) and the other six Gunasthanas, excluding the second and third, perform the highest level of binding of Mohaniya Karma (attachment karma).  The highest level of binding of the remaining six Karmas (actions) and their seventeen natures is performed by those residing in the tenth Gunasthana, called Sukshma Samparaya Gunasthana.  The highest level of binding of the second Kashaya (passion) is performed by those with Avirat Samyak Darshan (uninterrupted right faith), and the highest level of binding of the third Kashaya (passion) is performed by those with Deshavirati (freedom from attachment to place).

**Special Meaning:**

This verse explains the performers of the highest level of binding of the original nine natures.  First, it explains the highest level of binding of Aayu Karma (life-span karma) among the original Karmas (actions), saying: "Michch Ajaychau Aau" - those with Mithyatva (false belief) and the four Gunasthanas of Avirat (uninterrupted) - the fourth Gunasthana of Avirat Samyak Darshan (uninterrupted right faith), the fifth Gunasthana of Deshavirati (freedom from attachment to place), the sixth Gunasthana of Prammatavirati (freedom from attachment to delusion), and the seventh Gunasthana of Aprammatavirati (freedom from attachment to non-delusion).  The reason for not explaining the highest level of binding of Aayu Karma (life-span karma) in the remaining Gunasthanas is that Aayu Karma (life-span karma) is not bound in the third and eighth Gunasthanas, etc.  Although Aayu Karma (life-span karma) is bound in the second Gunasthana, the highest level of binding...

## Shataka

The reason for the **utkrista pradeshabandha** of **ayukarma** is not **utkrista yoga**. Therefore, except for the first, fourth, and from the fifth to the seventh **gunasthanas**, the **utkrista pradeshabandha** of **ayukarma** is not mentioned in the remaining **gunasthanas**.

The **svopagna tika** of the **gatha** clearly explains the reason for the absence of **utkrista yoga** in the second **gunasthanas**, **sasadan**. It states that in the future **mithyashti gunasthanas**, we will explain the two types of **utkrista** and **anutkrista pradeshabandha** of **anantaanubandhi kshaya**, namely **sadi** and **adhruva**. Since **anantaanubandhi** binding occurs in **sasadan**, if there were **utkrista yoga** there, then just as in **avirata** etc. **gunasthanas**, we would have mentioned the four options of **maadi** etc. for the **anutkrista pradeshabandha** due to the **utkrista pradeshabandha** of **apratyakhyanavaran** etc. **prakritis**. Similarly, due to the **utkrista pradeshabandha** of **anantaanubandhi** in **sasadan**, we should have mentioned the four options of **sadi** etc. for its **anutkrista pradeshabandha**. However, they are not mentioned. Therefore, it is known that either the time of **sasadan** is short, making such an effort impossible, or for some other reason, there is no **utkrista yoga** in **sasadan**. Furthermore, we will mention the **utkrista pradeshabandha** of **matijnanavaran** etc. **prakritis** in the **sukshmasampraya gunasthanas** and the **utkrista pradeshabandha** of the remaining **prakritis** in the **mithyadrishti gunasthanas**. This indicates that there is no **utkrista yoga** in **sasadan**.

Thus, by stating the absence of **utkrista yoga** in the **sasadan gunasthanas**, it is written that those who consider **sasadan** as the owner of the **utkrista pradeshabandha** of **ayukarma** have an opinion that is **upekshaniya** (negligible).

The statement "**ato ye sasvadan mpyaayuṣ utkriṣṭa pradeśa svaminaminanti janmanamupaskhaniyamaiti sthitam**" indicates that some **acharyas** believe in the **utkrista pradeshabandha** of **ayukarma** in **sasadan**.

## Panchap Karmagranth, Chapter 9

The verse hints at the **utkrista pradeshabanda** (highest binding place) of **mohaniya karma** (karma of delusion): "Bitiguna binu mohi sanna micchai" - except for the second and third gunasthanas (states of being), the **utkrista pradeshabanda** of mohaniya karma occurs in the remaining seven gunasthanas. 

This means that the **utkrista pradeshabanda** of mohaniya karma is found in the following seven gunasthanas: Mithyatva (falsehood), Aviрата (uncontrolled), Deshavipati (misery due to wrong place), Pramatta (inattentive), Apramatta (attentive), Apurvakarana (unprepared), and Anivritikarana (unliberated).

**Sasa** (second) and **Dan** (third) gunasthanas do not have **utkrista yoga** (highest state of binding), hence they do not have **utkrista pradeshabanda** either.

The absence of **utkrista yoga** in **Sasa** has been mentioned earlier. The reason for its absence in **Dan** is that the **utkrista pradeshabanda** of the second kashaya (passion) is found in **Aviрата** gunasthanas. If **Dan** had **utkrista yoga**, the **utkrista pradeshabanda** of the second kashaya would have been found there as well.

One might argue that **Aviрата** has fewer karmas binding than **Dan**, hence it is considered the **utkrista pradeshabanda**. However, this argument is not valid. In the ordinary state, both **Aviрата** and **Dan** bind seven karmas. Additionally, both bind seventeen **prakritis** (substances) of mohaniya karma. Therefore, the absence of **utkrista yoga** is the reason for not considering **Dan** as the **utkrista pradeshabanda**.

Except for **Aayu** (life span) and **Mohaniya**, the remaining six karmas - **Jnanavaran** (veil of knowledge), **Darshanavaran** (veil of perception), **Vedaniya** (painful), **Naam** (name), **Gotra** (lineage), and **Antaraya** (obstacles) - have their **utkrista pradeshabanda** in the tenth gunasthanas called **Sukshmasampray**. This is because **Sukshmasampray** has **utkrista yoga** and binds fewer karmas.

**340**

While stating the **utkrista pradeshabandha** (highest state of bondage) of the six **mula karma** (root karmas), the **utkrista pradeshabandha** of their seventeen **uttar prakritis** (sub-karmas) is also mentioned in the **sukshmasamprayagunasthan** (subtle state of the path) - **han sataras suhumo**. These seventeen **prakritis** are as follows: **matijnanavaran** (obscuration of knowledge) etc. five **jnanavaran** (obscurations of knowledge), **chakshudarshanavaran** (obscuration of perception) etc. four **darshanavaran** (obscurations of perception), **satavedaniya** (painful), **yasha** (fame), **kirti** (reputation), **uchchagotra** (high lineage), and **dana** (giving) **atraray** (hindrance) etc. five **antaraya karma** (hindrance karmas).

Except for **mohaniya** (delusion) and **ayu** (life span), the remaining six **mula karma** and their **matijnanavaran** etc. seventeen **uttar prakritis** have their **utkrista pradeshabandha** in the tenth **gunasthan** (state of the path). This is because, due to the absence of bondage of **mohaniya** and **ayukarma**, their share goes to the remaining six **karma** like **jnanavaran** etc.

The **utkrista pradeshabandha** of the second **kashaya** (passion) **apratyakhyanavaran** (non-rejection) is in the fourth **avirata samyagdasht** (state of perfect knowledge) **gunasthan**, and the **utkrista pradeshabandha** of the third **kashaya** **pratyakhyanavaran** (rejection) is in the fifth **deshaviriti** (state of detachment) **gunasthan** - **ajaya desa vittikasae**. This is because, in the **avirata samyagdristi** (state of perfect vision) **gunasthan**, there is no bondage of **misyanta** (false belief) and **anantaanubandhan** (infinite attachments), so their share goes to the **apratyakhyanavaran** **kashaya**. Similarly, in the **deshaviriti** **gunasthan**, there is no bondage of **apratyakhyanavaran** **kashaya**, so its share goes to the **pratyakhyanavaran** **kashaya**. Therefore, the **utkrista pradeshabandha** of **apratyakhyanavaran** **kashaya** is considered in the fourth **gunasthan**, and the **utkrista pradeshabandha** of **pratyakhyanavaran** **kashaya** is considered in the fifth **deshaviriti** **gunasthan**.

Thus, after indicating the **utkrista pradeshabandha** of the **mula karma** and some **uttar prakritis**, the following verses describe the **utkrista pradeshabandha** of other **prakritis**.

## Chapter 342:  The Realm of Binding

**The realm of binding for the non-attentive and non-reverted, the ninth-stage-dwelling Muni and the remaining natures is done by the deluded-view-holding living beings.**

**Explanation:** In the previous verse, we discussed the realm of binding for the twenty-five natures out of the one hundred and twenty bindable natures. In these two verses, we will discuss the realm of binding for the remaining eighty-five natures.

These sixty-five natures are divided into five sections. The first section includes five natures, the second thirteen, the third nine, the fourth two, and the fifth includes the remaining sixty-six natures besides the aforementioned ones.

The first section includes the five natures of **Purusha-veda** and the **four burning passions** (anger, pride, deceit, and greed). It is said that the ninth-stage-dwelling living being, known as **A-niyat-ti** (non-reverted), holds the realm of binding for these five natures. This is because **Purusha-veda** is a type of **no-kṣaya** (non-exhaustive) **mohaniya** (delusive), and since there is no binding of the six **no-kṣaya** in the ninth stage, their portion goes to **Purusha-veda**. After the binding of **Purusha-veda** is severed, the **four burning passions** hold the realm of binding. This is because all the substance of the twelve **kṣaya** (exhaustive) and **no-kṣaya** (non-exhaustive) - **mithyātva** (false view), **ananta-anubandhi** (infinitely connected), **apratyākhyāna-āvaraṇa** (non-rejected covering), and **pratyākhyāna-āvaraṇa** (rejected covering) - goes to the **four burning passions**.

The second section includes the thirteen natures of **shubha-viha-yoga-gati** (auspicious path of liberation), **manushya-ayu** (human lifespan), **deva-trika** (divine path, divine predecessors, and divine lifespan), **subhaga-trika** (auspicious, melodious, and worthy), **vaikriya-dvika** (vaikriya body, vaikriya limbs), **sama-chaturasra-samsthāna** (equally square-shaped body), **asāta-vedaniya** (not-to-be-experienced), **vajra-ṛṣabha-nārācha** (diamond-bull-elephant).

**Samhanan:** These thirteen **Prakritis** are bound by the **Utkrishta Pradeshbandh** of **Michcha Che** and **Sammo Gha** - **Mithyatva Drishti** or **Samyag Drishti** Jivas. This is because they are found due to their respective **Utkrishta Pradeshbandh**.

The third section consists of **Nidra**, **Prachala**, **Hasya**, **Rati**, **Shok**, **Arati**, **Bhay**, **Jugupsa**, and **Tirthankara** - these nine **Prakritis**. Their **bandh** is done by **Samyag Drishti** Jivas. The specific explanation is as follows: **Nidra** and **Prachala** have their **Utkrishta Pradeshbandh** done by **Samyag Drishti** Jivas with **Utkrishta Yoga** from the fourth **Avirat Samyag Drishti** to the eighth **Anoop Karan Gunasthan**. This is because **Samyag Drishti** Jivas do not have the **bandh** of **Styaadhitrik**, so their **bhag** also goes to **Nidra** and **Prachala**. Therefore, **Samyag Drishti** is included in the **swami** of **Utkrishta Pradeshbandh** of **Nidra** and **Prachala**. In the **Min Gunasthan**, the **bandh** of **Styaadhitrik** does not occur, but due to the absence of **Utkrishta Yoga**, it is not included.

**Hasya**, **Rati**, **Shok**, **Arati**, **Bhay**, and **Jugupsa** have their **bandh** in the **Gunasthan** from the fourth to the eighth **Gunasthan**. **Samyag Drishti** Jivas with **Utkrishta Yoga** in those **Gunasthan** do their **Pradeshbandh**. And the **bandh** of the **Tirthankara** **Prakriti** is done only by **Samyag Drishti** Jivas. Therefore, **Samyag Drishti** Jivas are described as the ones who do the **Utkrishta Pradeshbandh** of these nine **Prakritis**.

The third section consists of **Aharak Sharira** and **Aharak Angopaang**, these two **Prakritis**. Their **Utkrishta Pradeshbandh** is done by **Suti**, meaning the seventh **Aparamat** **Samyat** and the eighth **Apoovarnakaran** - these two **Gunasthan** residing **Muni**. Both these **Gunasthan** are of **Samyag Drishti** and due to being free from **pramad**, the word "**Muzai**" is used to include these two **Gunasthan**.

In this way, the **swami** of the **Utkrishta Pradeshbandh** of 55 **Prakritis** are...

The statement has already explained the names of the natures and their eligible recipients. In addition to these, the remaining 66 natures are described in the verse as follows: - Sema Ukkosapesaaga Miccho - The remaining natures are bound by the excellent Pradeshbandha by the Mithyadrishti Jiva. The details of which are as follows: Manushyadvik, Panchendriya jati, Audarikatik, Tejas, Karman, Varnachatusk, Agurulghu, Upghāt, Paradhat, Ucchvas, Tras, Badar, Paryapt, Pratyek, Sthiradvik, Punitaayashakāni and Nirman. Except for these twenty-five natures, the remaining 41 natures do not bind the Samyagdristi. Some of these natures are bound in the Sasadan Gunasthan, but there is no excellent yoga there, therefore the excellent Pradeshbandha of 41 natures is done only by Mithyadrishti.
Out of the above twenty-five natures, Audarik, Tejas, Karman, Varnachatusk, Agurulghu, Upghāt, Badar, Pratyek, Asthir, Ashubh, Ayashkīti, Nirman, these fifteen natures have their excellent Pradeshbandha in the twenty-three nature bound state of the Mamakarma bound Jivas, and the remaining ten natures have their excellent Pradeshbandha only in the twenty-five nature bound state of the Namakarma bound Jivas, not in others, and the binding of twenty-three and twenty-five is done only by Mithyadrishti. Therefore, the excellent Pradeshbandha of the remaining twenty-five natures is done only by the Mithyadrishti Jivas who have excellent yoga.
After thus directing the owners of the excellent Pradeshbandha of all the natures, the next verse tells about the owners of the Jghanya Pradeshbandha.

## Fifth Karma Bandha: 41

**Word Meanings:**

* **Sumuni:**  A non-negligent ascetic (muni)
* **Chumni:**  Two natures (Aharakatik)
* **Asali Asangni:**  A non-conscious being
* **Niryatig:**  Hell-bound
* **Suraddevayu:**  Deva-ayu (divine beings)
* **Suraviuvudurig:**  Deva-dvik and Vaikriya-dvik (divine beings)
* **Sammosampasti:**  The name-karma of a Jina (Tirthankara)
* **Jahannm:**  Inferior
* **Suhamnigoy:**  Subtle Nimodaya beings
* **Aikhni:**  At the time of birth
* **Sesa:**  Remaining natures

**Verse Meaning:**

Non-negligent munis bind the inferior regions of the Aharakatik. Non-conscious beings bind the inferior regions of the Narakatik and Deva-ayu, while those with right vision bind the inferior regions of the Deva-dvik, Vaikriya-dvik, and Tirthankara natures.  Except for these, the subtle Nimodaya beings bind the inferior regions of the remaining natures at the time of birth.

**Special Meaning:**

This verse explains the owners of the inferior regions. It mentions the owners of eleven natures by name, and states that the subtle Nimodaya beings are the owners of the inferior regions of the remaining 101 natures. This will be explained further below.

'Sumuni Dunni' means that the seventh guna-sthana muni binds the inferior regions of the Aharakatik. This should be understood in a general sense, but specifically, when a non-negligent ascetic (muni) with paravartaman yoga binds eight karmas and binds the 31-nature bandha-sthana of name-karma, and the yoga is also inferior, then they bind the inferior regions of the Aharakatik. Although the Aharakatik are also included in the 30-nature bandha-sthana, because there is one more nature in the 31-nature bandha-sthana, they receive less substance during the division.

Passage
It is obtained. Therefore, the instruction of thirty-one natural bond-places is given.
Similarly, the non-sentient being with the paravartaman yoga, binds the inferior regions of narakatrik (narakagati, narakanupurvi and narakayu) and devayu - asanni nirya timsuraou. The reason for considering the non-sentient, sufficient being as the binder of the inferior regions of these four natures is that the earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, air-bodied, plant-bodied, and two-sensed, three-sensed and four-sensed beings are not born in narakagati and devagati, so they do not have the bond of these natures, and the non-sentient, insufficient beings do not have such pure results that they can bind the natures worthy of devagati,
and neither are there such complex results that they can bind the natures worthy of narakagati.
The reason for considering the non-sentient, sufficient being, the binder of the above four natures, as having paravartaman yoga is that if one is taken to stay in the same yoga for a long time, then he will become a strong yoga. Therefore, paravartaman yoga has been accepted. Because there cannot be three yogas as there is change in yoga. Therefore, the non-sentient being, the sufficient binder of eight karmas, with the paravartaman yoga, binds the inferior regions of these four natures, narakatrik and devayu, while remaining in his own inferior yoga.
The samyagdristi being binds the inferior regions of these five natures - devadvik (devagati, devanaapurvi), vaikriyadvik (vaikriya sharira, vaikriya angopaang) and tirthankara. The reason for this is explained below - a human being was born in the heavens after binding the nature of tirthankara. There, in the first time of his birth, he is worthy of the human path, tirthankara

The **Tirthankara** nature binds the **thirty natural places** of the **name-karma** along with **nature**. This is the **inferior provincial binding** of the **Tirthankara** nature. Even in **hell**, the **Tirthankara** nature is bound, but in **heaven**, it is accepted by the **Anuttara** gods who have **inferior yoga**, because there is no such inferior yoga in **hell**. Therefore, the **inferior provincial binding** of the **Tirthankara** nature of the **right-seeing** being in **hell** is not mentioned. In **animal life**, the **Tirthankara** nature is not bound at all, and in **human life**, in the **first moment** of birth, the **two Tirthankara** **Manimahit** **name-karma** binds the **thirty natural places**. Therefore, due to the **lesser nature**, they get a **greater share**, and the **binding of the thirty natural places** along with the **Tirthankara** is only for the **restrained**, and there is also **greater yoga** there. Therefore, the **inferior provincial binding** of the **Tirthankara** nature is mentioned only for the gods who are bound by the **thirty natural places**.

The **inferior provincial binding** of **Devadik** and **Vaikriyhik** occurs in the **human** being born from **heaven** or **hell** at the time when they bind the **twenty-nine natural places** of the **name-karma** suitable for **heaven**. Because **gods** and **hell beings** do not bind these **natures** at all, and the **enjoying** **animal** beings bind them in the **first moment** of taking birth, but they bind only the **twenty-eight natural places** suitable for **heaven**. This gives them a **greater share** at the time of **distribution**. The same should be understood for the **human** being bound by the **twenty-eight natural places**. Therefore, the **inferior provincial binding** of these **four natures**, **Devadik** and **Vaikriyhik**, is mentioned for the **human** being bound by the **twenty-nine natural places**.

Except for the above **eleven natures**, the **inferior provincial binding** of the remaining **one hundred and six natures**...

The जीव, who is capable of attaining liberation, in the early stages of his existence, is bound by the subtle Pradeshbandha. Because he is bound by almost all the prakritis, and the most heinous yoga is also his.
In this way, one should know the owners of the excellent and heinous Pradeshbandha. Now, in the next section, we will explain the various types of Pradeshbandha and their dissolution.
Darshanachhag, bhay, kumchha, aaviti, turiya, kshaya, vigghanana. Mulachhage, anukkosso, chauh, duha, seshi, samvatha. ||64||
_ Word meaning - Darshanachhag - six darshanavarana, mayakunchha - fear, sunu, diti, stimaasi, jiti and gadhi kshaya, vigghanana - five antaraya, five jnanaavarana, mulachhage - six original prakritis, anukkosso - anuskrushta Pradeshbandha, chauh - four types, duha - two types, seshi - remaining three types of bandha, samvatha - everywhere.
_ Meaning - The darshanavarana karma is of six types, the second, third and fourth kshaya are of six types, the five antaraya and five jnanaavarana are of six types, the six original karmas are of four types. The anuskrushta Pradeshbandha is of four types. The said prakritis and the remaining prakritis are of two types.
_ Special meaning - The gatha discusses the various types of Pradeshbandha and their dissolution.
1 The Gola Kamakanda, verses 211 to 217, explains the owners of the excellent and heinous Pradeshbandha. Which is similar to the Dharma Grantha and also explains some special features about the heinous bandha of the 109 prakritis.

The nature of the **utkrusht**, **anutkrusht**, **jaghanya**, and **ajagghanya** bands, along with their **saadi**, **anaadi**, **dhruva**, and **adhruva** bhangs, has been explained previously. The consideration of their **mool** and **uttar** prakritis at the end of each band has also been discussed. Now, we will consider them in the context of **pradeshabandh**.

The act of acquiring the maximum number of **karma skandhas** is called **utkrusht pradeshabandh**. The act of acquiring the minimum number of **karma skandhas**, including the loss of one, two, or more **skandhas** from the **utkrusht pradeshabandh**, is called **anutkrusht pradeshabandh**. In this way, all the variations of **pradeshabandh** are encompassed within the **utkrusht** and **anutkrusht** categories.

The act of acquiring the minimum number of **skandhas** is called **jaghanya pradeshabandh**. The act of acquiring more and more **karma skandhas**, including the addition of one, two, or more **skandhas** to the **jaghanya pradeshabandh**, is called **ajagghanya pradeshabandh**. In this way, all the variations of **pradeshabandh** are encompassed within the **jaghanya** and **ajagghanya** categories, similar to the **utkrusht** and **anutkrusht** categories.

The **anutkrusht pradeshabandh** with its four variations of **saadi** etc., as mentioned in the **gatha** concerning the **darshan shatka** and other **prakritis**, is explained as follows:

In **darshan**, the six **prakritis** of **chakshudarshanaavaran**, **achakshudarshanaavaran**, **avhidarshanaavaran**, **kevaladarshanaavaran**, **nidra**, and **prachala** are acquired. Of these, the **utkrusht pradeshabandh** of the remaining four **darshanaavaran**, excluding **nidra** and **prachala**, occurs in the tenth **gunasthan** called **sukshmasampray**. This is because the **mohaniya** and **ayu karma** do not bind here, and the **nidra panchak** also does not bind. This allows the **jiva** to acquire a lot of **dravya**. After achieving this **utkrusht pradeshabandh**, when a **jiva** reaches the eleventh **gunasthan** called **upshantamoh** and then falls back to the tenth **gunasthan**, the **jiva** acquires the **anutkrusht** of the aforementioned **prakritis**.

## Century

If a being binds, then it is called *saadi*. Or, if a being, after binding in the excellent region in the tenfold qualities, binds again in the non-excellent region, then it is called *saadi*. Because the excellent state does not last for more than one or two moments. The non-excellent region binding that occurs before the excellent region binding is *anaadi*. The binding of an *abhavya* being is *dhruva*, and the binding of a *bhavya* being is *adhruva*.

The binding of *samyagdristi* beings does not occur in the *styanaddhitrika*. The excellent region binding of *nidra* and *prachala* occurs from the fourth to the eighth *ganasthanas*. Therefore, they also receive the path of *sapaladdhala*. When a being, after binding in the excellent region in any one of the aforementioned *ganasthanas*, binds again in the non-excellent region, it is called *saadi*. The non-excellent region binding that occurs before the excellent binding is *anaadi*. The binding of an *abhavya* is *dhruva*, and the binding of a *bhavya* is *adhruva*.

The excellent region binding of *bhaya* and *jugupsa* also occurs from the fourth to the eighth *ganasthanas*. One should know the four types of binding for their non-excellent region binding as well. That is, when *avirata* etc. fall from the excellent state or bind in the non-excellent region due to the cessation of binding, it is called *saadi*, and the binding before that is *anaadi*. The binding of an *abhavya* is *dhruva*, and the binding of a *bhavya* is *adhruva*.

Similarly, one should know the four types of binding for the non-excellent region binding of the *apratyakhyanavaran* *kashaya*, *pratyakhyanavaran* *kashaya*, *sanjwalan* *kashaya*, five *jnanavaranas*, and five *antarayas*. That is, the non-excellent region binding that occurs before the excellent region binding is *anaadi*, and the non-excellent binding that occurs after the excellent region binding is *saadi*. The binding of a *bhavya* being is *adhruva*, and the binding of an *abhavya* is *dhruva*.

Thus, the four types of **bhaṅga** (breakage) - **sādi** (beginning), **ādi** (beginning), **adhruba** (unstable), and **adhruba** (unstable) - occur in the **anutkṛṣṭa** (inferior) **pradeśabandhas** (regional bonds) of the thirty **prakr̥tis** (principles). However, for the **utkṛṣṭa** (superior), **jighanya** (inferior), and **ajighanya** (non-inferior) **pradeśabandhas**, only two options exist: **sādi** and **adhruba**. These are as follows:

While explaining the **bhaṅgas** of the **anutkṛṣṭa pradeśabandhas**, it has been clarified that a particular **guṇasthāna** (quality-state) possesses an **utkṛṣṭa pradeśabandhas**. This **utkṛṣṭa pradeśabandhas** occurs for the first time in its respective **guṇasthāna**, making it **sādi**. After one or two occurrences, either the bond completely disappears or the **anutkṛṣṭa pradeśabandhas** reappears, making it **adhruba**.

The **jighanya pradeśabandhas** of the thirty **prakr̥tis** occurs in the first **bhavas** (births) of the **sūkṣma nigodīya labdhyaparyāptak** (subtle, small, and capable of attaining liberation) **jīva** (living being). Subsequently, due to an increase in **yogaśakti** (yogic power), their **ajighanya pradeśabandhas** occurs. After a countable or uncountable period, when the **jīva** again attains that **bhavas**, the **jighanya pradeśabandhas** reappears, followed by the **ajighanya pradeśabandhas**. Thus, due to the occurrence of **jighanya** followed by **ajighanya**, and **ajighanya** followed by **jighanya** **pradeśabandhas**, both bonds are **sādi** and **adhruba**.

After considering the **bhaṅgas** of the thirty **prakr̥tis**, we now consider the **bhaṅgas** of the remaining sixty **prakr̥tis**. All four bonds in these are **sādi** and **adhruba**. Out of the sixty **prakr̥tis**, seventy-three are **adhrubavandhini** (unstable bond-possessing), hence all four bonds in them will be **sādi** and **adhruba**. Of the remaining seventeen **dhruvavandhini** (stable bond-possessing) **prakr̥tis**, the **utkṛṣṭa pradeśabandhas** of **styānaddhivik**, **mithyātva**, and **anantaanubandho** is performed by the **mithyādṛṣṭi** (false vision). The reason for the **utkṛṣṭa pradeśabandhas** is the **utkṛṣṭa yoga** (superior yoga), which lasts for one or two occurrences. Consequently, the **utkṛṣṭa bandhas** lasts for only one or two occurrences, and then...

Bhatak
After the excellent (utkrusht) region-bond, the non-excellent (anutkrusht) region-bond occurs. When there is an excellent yoga, again an excellent bond occurs. In this way, the cycle of non-excellent region-bond after excellent and excellent region-bond after non-excellent continues. Due to this, both these bonds are Saadi and Adhruva. The inferior (jghanya) region-bond of these natures is done by the subtle Nigodaya, Ladhyaparyaptak, Jiva, in the first time of Bhava. In the second, third, and subsequent times, the same Jiva does their non-inferior (ajghanya) region-bond. And in due course, the same Jiva again does their non-inferior region-bond. In this way, both these bonds are also Saadi and Adhruva.

The four types of Varna, Taijas, Karman, Agurulaghu, Upghāt, and Nirman Prakriti, their excellent, non-excellent, inferior, and non-inferior region-bonds should also be understood as Saadi and Adhruva in the same way. The excellent bond of these nine Prakritis is done by the Mithyatvi, excellent yoga, Bala Namkarma, which binds the twenty-three Prakriti bond-places.

In this way, one should know the nature of Saadi, etc., in the four bonds of the Uttar Prakritis, starting with the excellent. Now, let's consider the bonds of the Mula Prakritis.

Among the Mula Prakritis, the non-excellent region-bond of Jnanaavaran, Darshanavaran, Vedaniya, Nama, Gotra, and Antaraya has four options, namely Maadi, etc. These six have their excellent region-bond in the tenth Gunasthan, which is called Kshapak or Upshamka, subtle Paraya. Afterwards, when their non-excellent region-bond occurs again, that bond is Saadi. Before the excellent region-bond, that bond is Anaadi. The bond of the Bhavy is Adhruva, and the bond of the Abhavy is Dhruva. The remaining inferior, non-inferior, and excellent region...

## The Fifth Karmagrantha

There are two alternatives for the *saadi* and *adhruva* of *bandha*. Because previously, while explaining the *anuttkrishta pradeshabandha*, a hint was given about the existence of *utkrishta pradeshabandha* in the *sukshmasampraaya gunasthan*. This *utkrishta pradeshabandha* happens for the first time, hence it is *saadi*, and it does not happen again when the *anuttkrishta bandha* occurs, hence it is *adhruva*. The *jghanya pradeshabandha* of the aforementioned six karmas is done by the *sukshma nigodhya aparyaaptaka jiva bhag* in the first instance, and after the increase in *yoga*, the *ajghanya pradeshabandha* is done. Later, the *jghanya bandha* is done again. Thus, both of these are also *saadi* and *adhruva*.

From the six original *prakritis* like *jnanaavaran*, the remaining four *bandhas* of *mohaniya* and *ayu karma* have only two alternatives: *saadi* and *adhruva*. Since *ayu karma* is bound, its four *pradeshabandhas* are only *saadi* and *adhruva*. The *utkrishta pradeshabandha* of *mohaniya karma* is done by the *jiva* with *utkrishta yoga* up to the ninth *gunasthan*. After the *utkrishta*, the *anuttkrishta* and after the *anuttkrishta*, the *utkrishta pradeshabandha* happens. Therefore, both these *bandhas* are *saadi* and *adhruva*. Similarly, the *jghanya bandha* of *mohaniya* is done by the *sukshma nigodhya jiva*. Due to the *jghanya* being followed by *ajghanya* and *ajghanya* being followed by *jghanya bandha*, both these *bandhas* are *saadi* and *adhruva*.

In this way, one should know the order of *saadi* etc. of the *utkrishta* etc. *pradeshabandhas* of the original and subsequent *prakritis*.

1. The *saadi* etc. aspects of *pradeshabandha* in *Panchasangraha* and *Go. Karmakaanda* are described in accordance with *Karmagrantha*. For comparison, these sections are quoted here.

Before discussing the Pradeshbandh, it is important to clarify that there are numerous types of Prakritibandh and Pradeshbandh, which lead to Yogasthanas. Similarly, numerous types of Sthitibandh lead to Sthitibandh-Adhyavasayasthanas, and numerous types of Anubhagbandh lead to Manubhagantya-Dasasasthanas. Therefore, we will now briefly explain the Yogasthanas and their functions.

There are countless Yogasthanas, categorized by Prakriti, Sthiti, and Anubhagbandh. There are countless Sthitibandh-Adhyavasayasthanas, and countless Anubhagbandh-Adhyavasayasthanas.  These are all influenced by Karma-Pradesha, which has infinite qualities.

The term "Sediasankhijyanse" refers to the countless parts of a series. "Jogadanaagi" refers to Yogasthanas. "Paryadabhieya" refers to the different types of Prakriti, Sthiti, and Anubhagbandh. "Sthitibandh-Adhyavasayasthanas" refers to the places of contemplation related to Sthitibandh. "Anubhagbandh-Adhyavasayasthanas" refers to the places of contemplation related to Anubhagbandh. "Asankhguna" refers to countless qualities. "Kammapaesa" refers to the Karma-Pradesha, the sphere of Karma. "Anantguna" refers to infinite qualities.

The term "Mohauyavajjanam" refers to the state of delusion. "Nukkosao" refers to the analysis. "Saajhyaiyo" refers to the shared. "Hoi" refers to "becomes". "Sai" refers to "that". "Adhuva" refers to "further". "Sesaa" refers to "remaining". "Aaugamohaana" refers to the delusion of attachment. "Savehi" refers to "all". "Naanataraayani" refers to the obstacles to knowledge. "Niddha" refers to "sleep". "Anavajjakasaya" refers to the state of being unattached. "Bhayadugukaana" refers to the fear of suffering. "Dasanchaupayalana" refers to the ten types of conduct. "Chaubbigapppo" refers to the four types of attachment. "Anukkosao" refers to the analysis. "Samve" refers to "all". "Samvaana" refers to "all". "Sesapayeena" refers to "remaining". "Panchasangraha" refers to the five collections of scriptures. "Chanhpi" refers to "all six". "Anukkaso" refers to the analysis. "Padesachandho" refers to the sphere of Karma. "Chaduviyapppo" refers to the four types of attachment. "Sesatiye" refers to "remaining". "Duviyapppo" refers to the two types of attachment. "Mohaaunam" refers to the delusion of attachment. "Tissarahamanakkaso" refers to the third type of analysis. "Uttarapayadisuu" refers to the remaining types of attachment. "Chauviho" refers to the four types of attachment. "Bandho" refers to the bond. "Sesachoukkevi" refers to the remaining types of attachment. "Karmkara" refers to the Karma-Pradesha.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

**Nipa - Anantgune, Taksha Unse Bhi Raschcheya - Raschched - Ras Avibhaag Pratichched.**

The Gathaarth Yogasthan Shroni has countless parts. From these, the distinctions of natures, distinctions of states, the study-places of state-bond, and the study-places of section-bond are countless - gune, countless-gune. From these, the karmic skandhas are countless-gune, and from the karmic skandhas, the Raschched are countless-gune.

**55**

**Special Meaning:** The Gatha has explained the distinctions of bond and their causes in a brief manner. In this explanation, the following seven things have been taken:

(1) Nature Distinction, (2) State Distinction, (3) Region Distinction, (4) Raschched, meaning Section Distinction, (5) Yogasthan, (6) Study-place of State-bond, and (7) Study-place of Section-bond.

In these seven distinctions, there are four distinctions of bond and three distinctions of their causes. There are four distinctions of bond, but the reason for considering three distinctions of cause is that the cause of nature and region bond is the same. Therefore, the distinctions of cause are reduced to three instead of four. Here, the briefness of these seven is explained, which is less and which is more. That is, which of the seven has a greater number and which has a lesser number.

Starting with this statement of briefness, it is first explained that the number of Yogasthanas is countless parts of the Shroni - Sethi Asankhijjam Se Jogatthanani - meaning, in countless parts of the Shroni, there are as many Yogasthanas as there are regions of space. It has been explained earlier that the special power or strength is called Yoga, and the most subtle Yoga, Nigodhiya Sandhyaparyaptak Aav, is the first of existence...

This happens in time. That is, its potency is the least compared to other living beings. But the holder of the least potency, some parts of that living being have very little potency and some have even more potency than them. If one part is seen by the knowledge of the omniscient from among the parts with the least potency, then countless parts equal to the parts of the Lokakasha are found in it. This is about the parts with less potency, but in the same way, if the part with the most potency is observed, then countless times more parts are found in it than the parts of that lowly potent part.
Pasak
The potency of potency is called the indivisible intersection of the atomic or indivisible. The parts of the living being where these indivisible intersections are found in the least but equal number, they have one classification. The parts that hold more indivisible intersections than them have a second classification. Similarly, there is a separate classification for each part that holds one more indivisible intersection. The group of classifications up to where the parts holding one more indivisible intersection are found is called the first competitor. The parts that are found beyond that, in them, the number of indivisible intersections that are in the parts of the last classification of the first competitor, the group of those parts in which the number of indivisible intersections are found more than the number of indivisible intersections of the parts of countless Lokakasha, should be known as the first classification of the second competitor. The group of parts with one more indivisible intersection above this first classification is the second classification. In this way, by increasing one indivisible intersection at a time, the classifications 

Page #394:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma Granth

350 and an infinite number of parts equal to it, this group is called the second competitor. After this, no more regions holding indivisible intersections are found, but as many regions holding indivisible-indivisible intersections as there are regions of infinite Lokakasha are found. The third competitor begins according to the order mentioned before them. Similarly, the fourth, fifth, etc. competitors should be known. The measure of these competitors is also an infinite part of the series, and their group is called a Yogasthan.

This Yogasthan occurs in the first time of the existence of the most subtle Niodya Jiva with the least power. The second Yogasthan of a Jiva with slightly more power occurs in the same order. Similarly, with increasing power, there are third, fourth, fifth, etc. Yogasthanas. In this way, in the same order, these Yogasthanas of various Jivas or of the same Jiva due to the difference in time are as many as the regions of infinite space in the series.

_Even though there are infinite Jivas, the reason for considering Yogasthanas as infinite is that the Yogasthan of the seven Jivas is not separate, but is the same as that of infinite stationary Jivas, and is also the same as that of infinite Trasas. Therefore, there is no change in the number, but the dissimilar Yogasthanas are only an infinite part of the series. Therefore, they are considered infinite._

Even from these Yogasthanas, the differences in the natures of Gnanavarana, etc. are infinite. Although there are eight basic natures of Karma, such as Gnanavarana, etc., and 158 subsequent natures are mentioned, the peculiarity of bondage...

## The Fifth Karma Text
**249**

There are countless variations in the duration of the *antarmuhūrta* (the time between two breaths), sometimes two breaths, sometimes three breaths, and so on.  With each of these variations, there is a corresponding *āndhatā* (blindness).  Thus, when there are countless variations in the state of a single nature and a single living being, it is possible that there are countless variations in the state of all natures and all living beings.  Therefore, the variations in the state due to the variations in nature are countless times greater.

From the variations in the state, the *sthitibandha-adhyavasaya-sthāna* (the place of the determination of the bond of the state) are countless times greater.  The results of the determination that are the cause of each *sthitibandha* are numerous, because even the most insignificant bond of the state is caused by countless *lokapramāṇa* (world-sized) determinations.  That is, a single *sthitibandha* can be caused by a particular result of a particular living being, and by a particular result of another living being.  This should be understood in the same way for all other cases.  Therefore, the *sthitibandha-adhyavasaya-sthāna* are considered to be countless times greater than the variations in the state.

From the *sthitibandha-adhyavasaya-sthāna*, the *anubhāgabandha-adhyavasaya-sthāna* (the place of the determination of the bond of the part) are countless times greater.  That is, the results that are the cause of the *anubhāgabandha* are countless times greater than the results that are the cause of the *sthitibandha*.  The reason for this is that each *sthitibandha-adhyavasaya-sthāna* lasts until the end of the *antarmuhūrta*, but each *anubhāgabandha-adhyavasaya-sthāna* lasts for at least one breath and at most for *āha* (a period of time).  Therefore, there are as many *anubhāgabandha-adhyavasaya-sthāna* as there are *loka-ākāśa* (world-sized spaces) in each *sthitibandha-adhyavasaya-sthāna*.

1. The particular results of a living being that arise from the *kaṣāya* (passions) and cause the *sthitibandha* are called *sthitibandha-adhyavasaya*.

## Shataka

Thus, the Yogasthanas, Prakriti Bhedas, Sthiti Bhedas, Sthiti Bandha Adhyavasayasthanas, and Anubhaga Bandha Adhyavasayasthanas are all countless in number. And even beyond the Anubhaga Bandha Adhyavasayasthanas, the Karmapaesas and Anantgunas of the Karmas kandhas are also countless. Because a single Jiva, at one time, takes on an infinite number of Karma kandhas, which are greater than the Abhyavya Rashi and smaller than the Siddha Rashi. Therefore, the Karma kandhas are considered to be countless times greater than the Anubhaga Bandha Adhyavasayasthanas.

Even beyond the Karma kandhas, the Rashaccheda (divisions of Rasa) are also countless. This is because the Anubhaga Bandha Adhyavasayasthanas create the power of Rasa Phaladan (fruit-bearing) in the Karma Pudgals. If the Rasa or Anubhaga Shakti present in a single paramanu (atom) is divided by knowledge, then it will be found that there are countless divisions of Rasa within it, greater than the entire Jiva Rashi. In other words, each paramanu of all Karma contains countless divisions of Rasa, greater than the entire Jiva Rashi. However, each Karma kandha contains only an infinite fraction of the Siddha Rashi of Karma paramanus. Therefore, the Rashaccheda from the Karma kandhas are considered to be countless.

In this way, one should understand the relative insignificance of Bandha and its causes. From Yogasthanas to Anubhaga Bandha Adhyavasayasthanas, each is countless times greater than the previous one. And beyond that, the Karma kandhas and Rashaccheda are countless times greater, respectively.

1. The Panchasangraha also describes the relative insignificance of Yogasthanas, etc., in a similar way:

> "Countless are the Yogasthanas, and countless are the Prakriti Bhedas. The Sthiti Bhedas are countless, and beyond them are the Sthiti Bandhas. Beyond them are the Anubhaga Bandhas, and beyond them are the Karmapaesas and Rashaccheda." (Panchasangraha, 262-263)

> "The Karma Kandas (in the Go. Karma Kand, 258-260) only mention six types of relative insignificance, without mentioning the Rashaccheda. This description is consistent with the Karma Grantha."

## The Fifth Karma Granth

The description of Pradeshbandha has so far not mentioned its cause. Therefore, we now point out the causes of Pradeshbandha and, along with it, the previously mentioned Prakriti, Sthiti, and Anubhaga Bandha.

**Meaning of the words:**
* **Joga:** From Yoga
* **Payapieasam:** Prakritibandha and Pradeshbandha
* **Thihagumagam:** Sthitibandha and Anubhaga Bandha
* **Kasaya:** Kashaya

**Explanation:**
* Prakritibandha and Pradeshbandha are caused by Yoga, while Sthitibandha and Anubhaga Bandha are caused by Kashaya.

**Detailed Explanation:**
* Previously, four types of Bandha were mentioned: Prakritibandha, Pradeshbandha, Sthitibandha, and Anubhaga Bandha. Here, we explain their causes. The cause of Prakritibandha and Pradeshbandha is Yoga, while the cause of Sthitibandha and Anubhaga Bandha is Kashaya.
* The nature of Yoga and Kashaya has already been explained. Yoga is a power that, when combined with the necessary causes, transforms Karma Varganas into Karma Roop. The function of Yoga is to cause Karma Pudgalas to become Karma Roop in a specific quantity and to impart the nature of covering the qualities of knowledge, etc.
* The connection of incoming Karma Pudgalas with the soul for a specific period and the development of the power to produce intense, mild, etc., fruits in them is done by Kashaya. Therefore, Yoga is considered the cause of Prakritibandha and Pradeshbandha, while Kashaya is considered the cause of Sthitibandha and Anubhaga Bandha.
* As long as Kashaya remains, all four Bandhas exist. When Kashaya is subdued or destroyed, only two Bandhas remain: Prakriti and Pradesh Bandha.

The subsidence and destruction of the kṣayās occur from the eleventh to the thirteenth guṇasthānas, which results in the binding of nature and region in those guṇasthānas. And in the fourteenth ayogikevalī guṇasthāna, due to the absence of yoga, there is complete cessation of karma forever. The binding of nature and region that occurs from the eleventh guṇasthāna onwards takes place in one time period and is destroyed in another. This happens due to the power of yoga, but since there is no gāy parivāma, it does not bear its fruit.
The measure of the earlier yogasthānas is said to be an innumerable part of the śroṇi. Therefore, after stating the causes of binding, we now explain the nature of the śroṇi.
"Chaus rajjū logo buddhikao satrajjūmaṇaghaṇo. Tahogapaesa seḍhi payaro ya tathago." ||67||
Word meaning - Chaus rajjū - fourteen rajjū measure, logo - loka, buddhikao - done by mental calculation, satrajjūmaṇaghaṇo - seven rajjū measure, tad - its (of the dense loka), dohegapaesa - long, one pradeśa's seḍhi śreṇi, payaro - pratar, ya - and then its square.
Śataka
 
Gāthārtha - The loka is fourteen rajjū measure, when it is equated by mental calculation, it becomes seven rajjū measure in volume. The śreṇi is the line of pradeśas that are as long as the dense loka, and its square should be understood as the pratar.
Viśeṣārtha - This gāthā explains the nature of the loka, śreṇi, and pratar. The gāthā only mentions "Chaus rajjū logo" while indicating the nature of the loka, which means that the loka is fourteen rajjūs.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

This only explains the height of the universe. Here, we will clarify the nature of the universe.

All types of substances - inert or sentient, visible or invisible, subtle or gross, stationary or mobile, etc. - wherever they are seen or where a living being experiences the fruits of their karma, in the form of happiness, sorrow, virtue, and vice, is called the universe. This universe is the basis for every action that takes place in these substances or every action performed by these substances. Even though these substances undergo transformations from one state to another, they do not abandon their original qualities, nature, and essence. It never happens that the inert becomes sentient or the sentient becomes inert, the concrete becomes abstract or the abstract becomes concrete. All substances are the cause of their own existence and manifestation, and they have their own unique functions. Therefore, keeping all these perspectives in mind, the scriptures explain the nature of the universe as follows: Dharma, Adharma, Akasha, Kala, Pudgala, and Jiva, these six substances, wherever they are found, are called the universe. In other words, the universe is the aggregate of these six substances. There is no part of the universe where these six substances are not found.

Out of these six substances, Akasha (space) is all-pervasive, while the other substances are pervaded by it. This means that Akasha exists along with the other five substances, Dharma, etc., and also exists outside of them. It is infinite, meaning it has no end. Therefore, the part of Akasha where the six substances, Dharma, etc., reside is called the universe, and the remaining infinite Akasha beyond it is called Alok (non-universe). This universe is permanent, eternal, indestructible, imperishable, and stable. It is neither destroyed nor newly created.

After understanding the nature of the Shatak Lok, the curiosity arises as to what is the basis of the state of this Lok? Present-day scientists have also tried to know the basis of the Lok, but it is not possible to have a correct understanding of the state of this infinite Lok through finite knowledge. Spiritual vision is much more reliable and authentic than knowledge gained through instruments. Therefore, here we explain the basis of Lokasthiti as propounded by the omniscient Bhagwan Mahavira. He has propounded the state of the Lok in eight ways:
(1) Vata-Tanuvat is established in Akash, (2) Udhi-Ghanodhi is established in Vata, (3) Prithvi-Udhi is established, (4) Vas and Sthavar beings are established in Prithvi, (5) Ajiva is established in Jiva, (6) Jov is established in Karma, (7) Ajava is collected from Jiva, (8) Jiva is collected from Karma.
The essence of the above statement is that the basis of Vas, Sthavar, etc. beings is Prithvi, the basis of Prithvi is Udhi, the basis of Udhi is Vayu, and the basis of Vayu is Akash. That is, Jiva, Ajiva, etc. all substances reside on Prithvi, and Prithvi rests on the basis of Vayu, and Vayu rests on the basis of Akash.
The explanation of calling Prithvi Vatadharit is that the foundation of Prithvi is based on Dhanodhi. Dhanodhi is aquatic and its form is like solidified ghee. Its thickness is twenty thousand yojanas in the middle below. Below Dhanodhi is the covering of Dhanavar, i.e.
1 Bhagavati Sha 6 

Page #402:
---------------------------
## The Five Karmas: Chapter 365

The **Ghanodadhi** is enveloped by **Ghanavat**, and its form resembles thin, melted ghee. Its length, width, and circumference are countless yojanas. This **Ghanavat** is also enveloped by **Tanuvat**. Its length, width, circumference, and middle thickness are countless yojanas. Its form should be understood as resembling heated ghee.

Below the **Tanuvat** lies an expanse of space, countless yojanas in measure. These **Ghanodadhi**, **Ghanavat**, and **Tanuvat** can be understood by analogy as wooden vessels placed one inside the other. In the same way, these three **Vatavalas** are situated within each other. That is, the **Ghanodadhi** is like a small vessel, the **Ghanavat** like a medium vessel, and the **Tanuvat** like a large vessel, followed by space. Just as an object is placed within the smallest vessel, so too is the earth situated within the **Ghanodadhivala**.

The scriptures describe the shape of the **Lok** as **Supratishtha Sansthan**. The form of **Supratishtha Sansthan** is as follows:

If a bowl is placed upside down on the ground, another bowl is placed upright on top of it, and a third bowl is placed upside down on top of that, the shape that is formed is called **Supratishtha Sansthan**, and this is the shape of the **Lok**.

Many Acharyas have explained the shape of the **Lok** through various metaphors. For example, the shape of the **Lok** is like a man dancing with his hand on his waist and his legs spread out. Therefore, the **Lok** is compared to the form of a man. In some places, the shape of the **Lok** is described as being like a mridanga placed on a **Benasan**. Similarly, other objects that are wide at the base, narrow in the middle, wide at the top, and then narrow again, and whose shape is formed by placing them one on top of the other, will form the shape of the **Lok**. 

Page #403:

The universe is divided into three realms: the lower realm (Adholōka), the middle realm (Madhyalōka), and the upper realm (Urdhvalōka). The central point of these realms is Mount Meru. Mount Meru is located in the middle realm (Madhyalōka). Its base is one thousand yojanas wide and its height is sixty-six thousand yojanas above the ground. Its length and width extend ten thousand yojanas in all four directions on the flat surface of the earth. 

The lower realm (Adholōka) begins nine hundred yojanas below the base of Mount Meru and extends eighteen hundred yojanas upwards. This means that the middle realm (Madhyalōka) is eighteen hundred yojanas in height, nine hundred yojanas below and nine hundred yojanas above the base of Mount Meru. The area above the middle realm (Madhyalōka) is called the upper realm (Urdhvalōka).

The height of the lower realm (Adholōka) and the upper realm (Urdhvalōka) is greater than their width, while the middle realm (Madhyalōka) is wider and longer than its height. The middle realm (Madhyalōka) is only eighteen hundred yojanas high, but its length and width are one rāju.

The length and width of the lower realm (Adholōka) and the upper realm (Urdhvalōka) are not uniform. The length and width of the lower realm (Adholōka) is slightly less than seven rājus in the seventh hell, while the first hell is one rāju long and wide, which is equal to the length and width of the middle realm (Madhyalōka). The length and width of the upper realm (Urdhvalōka) is five rājus in the fifth heaven, and then decreases by one rāju for each subsequent heaven, until the topmost part of the realm is one rāju long and wide. This means that the final part of the upper realm (Urdhvalōka) is as long and wide as the middle realm (Madhyalōka). The shape of the universe is depicted in the attached diagram.

## The Fifth Karmagrantha

**367**

The summary of the aforementioned length, width, etc. of the Lok is as follows: At the bottom, where the seventh Naraka is, it is seven Rajus wide. From there, it gradually decreases, and by the time it reaches the first Naraka at the top, it is one Raju wide. After that, it gradually increases, reaching a width of five Rajus near the fifth Devalok. Then, it gradually decreases again, reaching a width of one Raju at the final part. The total length of the Lok is fourteen Rajus, and the maximum width is Gal Raju Nasa Jay Chauhan El.

This Lok is packed with both moving and stationary beings. Moving beings reside only in the Asnadi, but stationary beings reside in both As and Stavar Nadi. The fourteen Rajus long and one Raju wide space in the middle of the Lok, from top to bottom, is called Prasnadi, and the rest of the Lok is called Stavarnadi.

If we imagine this fourteen Rajus high and maximum seven Rajus and minimum one Raju long and wide Lok as a cube, then it would have seven Rajus height, seven Rajus length, and seven Rajus width. Because if we divide the entire Lok into pieces of one Raju each, there would be 343 pieces. Out of these, 166 are Adholok and 147 are Urvalok Dhanrajus. The cube root of these is 7. Therefore, the measure of the Panikrit Lok is seven Rajus, and there are 343 Dhanrajus.

The method of calculating this is as follows: The width of the Adholok at the bottom is seven Rajus, and it gradually decreases on both sides, leaving one Raju at the middle Lok at a height of seven Rajus. If we divide this Adholok into two equal parts and then flip both parts and place them side by side, its width will extend downwards...

And there are four *rajū* on each side going upwards, but the height remains seven *rajū* everywhere. For example:

From the middle of this *adholoka*, there are two sections of this shape, and by reversing both parts and digging,
After equating the *adholoka*, now we equate the *urdhvaloka*. The *urdhvaloka* is five *rajū* wide in the middle, east to west. Leaving the middle three *rajū* area as it is, take two triangular sections, one *rajū* wide on each side and three and a half *rajū* high. Dividing both sections from the middle, there are four triangular sections. Each section has a base of one *rajū* and a perpendicular of one and a quarter *rajū*. These four sections should be reversed and placed, two sections on both sides of the lower part of the *urdhvaloka* and two sections on both sides of its upper part. By doing so, there is no difference in the height of the *urdhvaloka*, but its width becomes three *rajū* everywhere. The form of the above statement will be as follows:

Although the Lok is a circle and it is a cube, therefore to make it a circle, it should be multiplied by 16 and divided by 22. Then it is proven to be slightly less than seven Raju long, wide, and round. But in practice
366
When the new shape of the Urdhvaloka is combined with the new shape of the Adholoka, it becomes a square area of seven Raju wide, seven Raju high, and seven Raju thick. Therefore, since the height, width, and thickness are all seven Raju, the Lok is proven to be a cube of seven Raju. Which is like this
In practice, one should understand the Lok as a cube of seven Raju.

This clarifies the nature of Pratara. A row of one-one Pradesh (space) extending for seven Rajus is called a Shreni. Wherever the non-overlapping part of the Shreni is mentioned, this same Shreni should be taken.

The square of Shreni is called Pratara, meaning that the number of Pradesh in Ani multiplied by the same number of Pradesh gives the measure of Pratara. The amount produced by multiplying two equal numbers with each other is called the square of that number. For example, multiplying 7 by 7 gives its square, 49. Or, a row of one-one Pradesh extending for seven Rajus in length and seven Rajus in width is called Pratara.

Multiplying Pratara (square) and Shreni with each other gives the measure of Ghana. Meaning, multiplying three equal numbers with each other gives Ghana. For example, 7 x 7 x 7... this is called Ghana.

In this way, one should understand the measure of Shreni, Pratara, and Ghana Lok.

The detailed description of Pradeshbandha, along with the topics mentioned in the first verse by the author, "Namiy Jinam Dhubaandha", etc., has already been described. Now, in the same verse, the words "Ya" (Cha) refer to Upshamashreni and Kshapakani, which are now being described. First, the description of Upshamashreni is being given.

In Triloksar Gatha 7, the measure of Raju is stated as one-seventh of Shreni: "Nagasedisatbhagoo Rajju". And in Dravyaloksaprakash, one Raju is stated as equal to countless koti-koti yojanas, derived from the measure of Angula: "Pramanangulanishpannayोजनानां प्रमाणत: । असंख्यकोटीकोटीभिरेकारमुः प्रकीर्तिता ।।"

**Sarg Sha 641**

From Lokamajya to Uramdhastyanka, the Shreni is measured as a continuous series of Akashdeshas.

#### Upshamani
**Anvassanpusitthiveychakkam cha purisaveyam cha | Do vo egantare sarisa sarisan usame ||6||**

**Word Meaning:** Anvassanpusitthivey - Infinitely connected kshaya, darshan mohaniya, napunsak ved, stri ved, chhaya haspadi patak, cha - also, purisadeyam - purusha ved, and, do do - two two, egantare - one one's interval, sarisa sarisan - similar same, usame - subsides.

**Explanation:** (Upshamashroni doing) First subsides the infinitely connected kshaya, then the darshan mohaniya, and after that, in order, the napunsak ved, stri ved, hasyaadi shatk and purusha ved, and after that, giving an interval of one one (sanjwalan) kshaya, subsides two two similar kshayas together.

**Special:** From the eighth gunasthan, two categories begin - Upshamani and Kshapkoani.

Nathkar has explained the nature of Upshamani in the gatha, that how the nature is subsided by the ascender of Upshamani. In short, the nature of Upshamani is that the stream of progressively increasing results by which the soul subsides the mohaniya karma completely, is called Upshamani. The beginning of this Upshamani is the aprammat samyat, and the one who falls from Upshamani can be any of aprammat samyat, pramat samyat, deshvirati or avirati. That is, the one who falls comes to the fourth gunasthan in order. 

Page #409:

## 372
## Century

If one falls from there, they also attain the previous Gunasthan.

There are two parts of Upshamni: (1) Samyakta of Upsham Bhava and (2) Naritra of Upsham Bhava. Of these, Samyakta of Upsham Bhava, which pacifies the Mohaniya of Maritra, is attained only in the seventh Gunasthan. Because all seven Prakruti of Darshan Mohaniya are pacified in the seventh, the Prasthapika of Upsham Shroni is only Apratiman Samyata. Some Acharyas believe that any Avirat Samyagdristi, Deshavirat, Prammat or Apratmat Gunasthanvarti pacifies Anantanu bandhi Kashaya, and only Apratmat, who is in Samyam, pacifies Darshanvik etc. In this, Anantanu bandhi Kashaya is pacified first, and Darshanvik is pacified only in the fifth. According to this opinion, the beginning of Upsham Shroni can be considered from the fourth Gunasthan.

The description of the pacification of Anantanu bandhi Kashaya is as follows: From the fourth to the fifth Gunasthan, a Jiva in any one of these Gunasthanas performs three Karana to pacify Anantanu bandhi Kashaya: Yathapravritta Karana, Apurva Karana, and Aniyukta Karana. In Yathapravritta Karana, there is gradual, infinite, pure progress in the last Maya. Due to this, there is an increase in the Anubhag of auspicious Prakruti and a decrease in the Anubhag of inauspicious Prakruti. But there is no Sthiti Ghat, Rasha Ghat, Guna Shreni, or Guna Sankrama, because there are no pure results worthy of them here. The time of Yathapravritta Karana is Antamuhurt.

After the end of the said Antamuhurt time, the second Apurva Karana takes place. In this Karana, there is Sthiti Ghat, Rasha Ghat, Guna Shreni, Guna Sankrama, and...

## The Fifth Chapter

**Apuurva Sthitibandh**

These five actions are performed. In the first moment of Apuurvakaran, the number of Kones in the initial state is reduced by an infinite factor in the final moment by Sthitighāt. By Rasghāt, the essence of inauspicious natures is gradually destroyed. In Gunani Rachana, except for the final moment's state, some Dalikas are taken from the upper state Dalikas in each moment and deposited in the upper state Dalikas of the Udayavali. The deposition of Dalikas is done in such a way that the least number of Dalikas taken in the first moment are established in the first moment, an infinite number of times more Dalikas in the second moment, an infinite number of times more Dalikas in the third moment, and so on. In this way, an infinite number of times more Dalikas are deposited until the final moment of the Antamuhurt. The deposition of Dalikas taken in the second and subsequent moments is also done in the same way.

The order of Gunani Rachana has been explained earlier, that the Dalikas taken in the first moment are few, and after that, an infinite number of times more Dalikas are taken in each subsequent moment. The deposition of Dalikas happens in specific moments, not in the moments above Antamuhurt. This same perspective and order should be understood here as well, that the Dalikas taken in the first moment are few, and in the second and subsequent moments, they are infinite, and the creation of all of them happens in the moments equivalent to Antamuhurt. The measure of time does not extend beyond Antamuhurt.

By Gunasankram, in the first moment of Apuurvakaran, a few Dalikas of the infinite number of inauspicious natures are transferred to other natures.

And after that, in every time period, an innumerable number of souls transition to other natures. In the first time period of *Apuurvakaran*, the *Sthitibandh* is also *Apuurva* (very little). _When the time period of *Apuurvakaran* ends, the third *Anivritikaran* occurs. In this also, from the first time period itself, the five actions mentioned earlier, namely *Sthitighāt* etc., occur simultaneously until the *Apuurva Sthitibandh*. Its time period is also *Antamuhurt* in measure. When a part of it has passed and one part remains, then, leaving aside the lower *Nishakas*, the remaining *Nikas* are also subjected to *Antarakaran* like the *Mithyatva* *Antarakaran* mentioned earlier, in the measure of one *Aavali* of *Anantānubandhi* *Kshaya*. The souls that are subjected to *Antarakaran* in the measure of *Antamuhurt* are lifted from there and established in other natures that are bound. When *Antarakaran* begins, in the second time period, the souls that are bound above the *Anantānubandhi* *Kshaya* are pacified. This pacification occurs for a few souls in the first time period, for an innumerable number of souls in the second time period, and for an innumerable number of souls in the third time period. In this way, until the *Antamuhurt* time period, the pacification of an innumerable number of souls occurs in each time period. The result of this is that in all these time periods, the entire *Anantānubandhi* *Kshaya* is pacified, and this pacification is so strong that it becomes incapable of the actions of *Uday*, *Udirana*, *Nidhati*, etc. This is the pacification of *Anantānubandhi* *Kshaya*.

Some Acharyas believe that *Anantānubandhi* *Kshaya* is not pacified but is disintegrated. This opinion is mentioned in *Karma-prakriti* (pacification) verse 31.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

**Chapter 4**

The fourth, fifth, and sixth Gunasthana-dwelling beings, who are the appropriate living beings of the four gatis, disassociate themselves from the infinite-bound kashayas through the three karmas. However, here there is neither an antar-karana nor a suppression of the infinite-bound.

After the suppression of the infinite-bound, the suppression of the Darshan-mohaniya-trika-mithyatva, Samyag-mithyatva, and Samyaktva natures occurs. Of these, Mithyatva is suppressed by the Mithyadrishti and Vedak-Savyadrishti (Kshayopa-shamic Samyagdristi), but the suppression of Samyag-mithyatva and Samyaktva is done only by the Vedak-Samyagdristi. When the Mithyadrishti being first produces the Samyaktva, it suppresses the Mithyatva. However, in the suppression series, this first Samyaktva is not useful, but the second Samyaktva is useful. Because in this, the complete suppression of the Darshan-antrika occurs. Therefore, here the Vedak-Samyagdristi is considered to be the suppressor of the Darshan-trika.

**Regarding the suppression of Darshan-moha, the Karma-prakriti says:**

"If the Vedak-Samyagdristi ascends the suppression series, then first, according to the rule, it suppresses the Darshan-mohaniya-trika. And it has this special quality that while doing the antar-karana, it suppresses the first state of the Anudita-mithyatva and Samyag-mithyatva, and the first state of Samyaktva, by the Avali-pramana and Samyaktva."

## Ghatak

After the mitigation of the infinite Kshaya and Darshan Trika, the process of mitigating the Charitramohaniya begins.

To mitigate the Charitramohaniya, one performs the three karmas of Vavritta, etc. However, there is a difference: in the seventh Gunasthan, Yathapravrittakarana occurs; in the eighth Gunasthan, called A-purvakarana, A-purvakarana occurs; and in the ninth Gunasthan, called Anivrittikarana, Anivrittikarana occurs. Here too, actions like Sthiti Ghat, etc., take place, but the special feature is that from the fourth to the seventh Gunasthan, the Gunasankraman that occurs in the Anukaran and Nivrittikaran is of the same nature as the one related to which these results occur. However, in the A-purvakarana Gunasthan, the Gunasankraman of all the Ashubha Prakruti takes place.

When a certain amount of time has passed during the A-purvakarana, the Vaidhvichched of Nidra and Prachala, called Nidradvik, occurs. After more time passes, the Vaidhvichched of the thirty Prakruti, including Suradvik, Panchendriya Jati, etc., occurs. Finally, in the last moments, the Vaidhvichched of Hasya, Rati, Bhaya, and Jugupsa occurs.

The Muhurta testifies to this. After mitigating the Charitramohaniya, one performs the three karmas of Yathapravritta, etc., for thousands of times, going back and forth between the Pramatta and A-prayatta Gunasthan. The special feature of the third, Anivrittikarana, is described in the following verses.

**1** The Prakruti that become Vaidhvichched in the A-purvakarana Gunasthan are as follows:

Adavan, A-puchvaimini, Niduganta, Chhappan Pan Bhage, Suradug, Panidi, Sukhagayi, Tasanav, Uralvinu, Tavanga, Samachaur, Nimina, Jin, Varn, Agurulhubau, Falans, Tisato, Charame, Chhavisbandh, Hasar, Kuchch, Bhayameo.

After this comes the **Anivrittikaran** Gunasthan. In it, too, there are **Sthitighāt** etc. as before. After countless parts of **Anivrittikaran** have passed, the **Antarakaran** of the twenty-one types of **Charitramohaniya** takes place. The **Antarakaran** places the **Dalikas** related to those **Karma** types that have both **Bandha** and **Uday** at that time in the **Prathama Sthiti** and **Dvitiya Sthiti**. For example, the **Purushaveda** that ascends to **Ani** due to the **Uday** of **Purushaveda**. The **Antarakaran** places the **Dalikas** related to those **Karmas** that only have **Uday** at that time and not **Bandha** only in the **Prathama Sthiti**, not in the **Dvitiya Sthiti**. For example, the **Striveda** that ascends to **Shreni** due to the **Uday** of **Striveda**. The **Antarakaran** places the **Dalikas** related to those **Karmas** that do not have **Uday** but only **Bandha** at that time in the **Dvitiya Sthiti**, not in the **Prathama Sthiti**. For example, the remaining **Sanjwalan** **Kshayas** that ascend to **Shroni** due to the **Uday** of **Sanjwalan** **Krodha**. However, the **Antarakaran** places the **Dalikas** related to those **Karmas** that have neither **Bandha** nor **Uday** in other types. For example, the **Dvitiya** and **Tritiya** **Kshayas**.

The explanation of the above **Chaturbhangi** is as follows:

1. The **Dalikas** of those **Karmas** that have both **Bandha** and **Uday** at that time are placed in the **Prathama Sthiti** and **Dvitiya Sthiti**.
2. Those **Karmas** that only have **Uday** at that time are placed only in the **Prathama Sthiti**.
3. The **Dalikas** of those **Karmas** that only have **Bandha** at that time are placed in the **Dvitiya Sthiti**.
4. The **Dalikas** of those **Karmas** that have neither **Uday** nor **Bandha** are placed in other types.

A **Shataka** (century) by performing **Antar-Karana** (inner reflection) in a single **Anta-Muhurta** (moment) subdues the **Mapunsaka Veda** (masculine-feminine neutral Veda), then in another **Anta-Muhurta** subdues the **Stri-Veda** (feminine Veda), and then after subduing the **Hasya-adi Shatka** (six passions: laughter, anger, greed, delusion, pride, and jealousy), the **Purusha-Veda** (masculine Veda) is freed from **Bandha** (bondage), **Udaya** (arising), and **Udirana** (excitation).

After subduing the **Hasya-adi Shatka**, in less than two **Avalika** (moments), the entire **Purusha-Veda** is subdued. At the time when the **Hasya-adi Shatka** are pacified and the first state of the **Purusha-Veda** weakens, **A-pratyakhyana-Avarana** (non-rejection covering), **Pratyakhyana-Avarana** (rejection covering), and **Sanjwalana Krodha** (burning anger) begin to be subdued simultaneously. When one **Avalika** remains in the first state of **Sanjwalana Krodha**, the **Bandha**, **Udaya**, and **Udirana** of **Sanjwalana Krodha** are severed, and the **A-pratyakhyana-Avarana** and **Pratyakhyana-Avarana** Kosha (sheath) are subdued. At that time, except for one **Avalika** in the first state of **Sanjwalana Krodha** and less than two **Avalika** in the higher state, all other **Dalika** (particles) are pacified. Then, in less than two **Avalika**, the **Sanjwalana Kosha** is subdued.

From the time when the **Bandha**, **Udaya**, and **Udirana** of **Sanjwalana Krodha** are severed, until the second state of **Sanjwalana Mana** (burning mind), the **Dalika** are brought to the first state. From the time of bringing them to the first state, **A-pratyakhyana-Avarana**, **Pratyakhyana-Avarana**, and **Sanjwalana Mana** begin to be subdued simultaneously. When less than three **Avalika** remain in the first state of **Sanjwalana Mana**, the **Dalika** of **A-pratyakhyana-Avarana** and **Pratyakhyana-Avarana Mana** are not projected into **Sanjwalana Mana**, but into **Sanjwalana Maya** (burning illusion) etc. When one **Avalika** remains, the **Bandha**,

The **udaya** and **udirana** of **Avyakhyanavaran** and **Pratyakhyanavaran** karma cease, and their **upshama** occurs. At that time, except for the **karmadalikas** bound in the first state of **Sanjvalan** karma in one **avali** and two **avalis** less than the time, the **upshama** of the remaining **dalikas** occurs. After that, the **upshama** of **Sanjvalan** karma occurs in two **avalis** less than the time.

From the time when the **bandha**, **udaya**, and **udirana** of **Sanjvalan** karma cease, until the **dalikas** of the second state of **Sanjvalan** karma, it progresses in the same way as the first state. From that time, the **upshama** of all three **mays** begins simultaneously. In the first state of **Sanjvalan** karma, when three **avalis** less than the time remain, the **dalikas** of **Avyakhyanavaran** and **Pratyakhyanavaran** karma are not projected into **Sanjvalan** karma, but are projected into **Sanjvalan** **lobha**. When one **avali** remains, the **bandha**, **udaya**, and **udirana** of **Sanjvalan** karma cease, and the **upshama** of **Avyakhyanavaran** and **Pratyakhyanavaran** karma occurs. At that time, except for the **dalikas** bound in the first state of **Sanjvalan** karma in one **avali** and two **avalis** less than the time, the **upshama** of the remaining **dalikas** occurs. After that, the **upshama** of **Sanjvalan** karma occurs in two **avalis** less than the time.

When the **bandha**, **udaya**, and **udirana** of **Sanjvalan** karma cease, from that time until the **dalikas** of the second state of **Sanjvalan** **lobha**, it progresses in the same way as the first state. The **vedana** time of **lobha** is divided into three parts, and two parts...

The first state of Atik Praman lasts for a period of time. In the first division, it takes the Dalikas from the previous competitors and makes them extremely tasteless, meaning it removes their taste completely. In the second division, it takes the Dalikas from both the previous and the new competitors and performs infinite cultivation, meaning it makes them infinitely tasteless and establishes them in an interval. At the end of the period of cultivation, it pacifies the greed of both A-pratyakhyana-avaran and Pratyakhyana-avaran. At the same time, the bondage of Sanjwalan Lobha is broken. With this, the ninth Gunasthan of Anivrittikaran comes to an end.

After this comes the tenth Gunasthan of Sukshma-Samparaya. The duration of this Gunasthan is an Antarmuhurt. Upon entering it, it takes some of the cultivations from the previous state and applies them to the first state for a period equal to the duration of Sukshma-Samparaya. It also pacifies the remaining Dalikas bound in two Avaliks in a shorter period of time. At the end of Sukshma-Samparaya, Sanjwalan Lobha is pacified. At the same time, the bondage of five types of Jnana-avaran, twelve types of Darshan-avaran, five types of Antaraya, Yash-Kirti, and Ucch-Gotra is broken. In the subsequent time, the eleventh Gunasthan of Upashanta-Kshaya is attained, and in this Gunasthan, the pacification of twenty types of Mohaniya takes place.

1. The description of pacification in Labdhi-sar (Digambar Literature) verse 205, 361 is similar to this. However, it does not mention the pacification of Ananta-Anubadhi but instead considers it as Visan-yojan.

"Bariyah-imuh-a Ved-sammi Anan Viyojita" || 205

Meaning: "The pacification is towards the direction of Charitra, the Vedak Samyag-drishti, and the Visan-yojan of Ananta-Anubadhi."

This statement clearly shows that the author is biased towards Visan-yojan.

## Fifth Karma Group

Although all the natures of mohaniya karma are completely subsided in the upshama shreni, even after being subsided, the existence of that karma remains. Just as when a filter is put in muddy water, the dirt settles down and the water becomes clear, but the dirt remains below, similarly in the upshama shreni, the mohaniya karma, which contaminates the feelings of the jiva, is pacified. As the results like apurvakarana etc. ascend, the particles of the remaining natures of mohaniya karma, like dust, are pacified one after another. In this way, the natures that have gone into upshama cannot be reduced or increased in their state and division. They cannot be awakened or stimulated, nor can they be transformed into other natures. But this upshama is done for a short period of time. Therefore, when the jiva reaches the eleventh gunasthan after subsiding subtle greed in the tenth gunasthan, the subsided kshayas emerge again after a minimum of one time and a maximum of an antamuhurta. The result of this is that the ascending jiva of the upshama shreni starts to descend in the same order in which it ascended, and its downfall begins. The downfall of a jiva with pacified kshayas is inevitable. This fact is clearly stated in the necessary appointment gatha 118:

**Shataka**

The passions calmed by a virtuous man can also cause the downfall of a person with a character similar to a Jina, let alone other passionate men?  Therefore, as one descends, the natures that were freed in each of the Gunasthanas while reading, begin to bind again upon reaching those Gunasthanas.

Descending, he stops at the seventh or Nth Gunasthana, and if he does not control himself there, he reaches the fifth and fourth Gunasthanas. If the Anantanubandhi arises, he becomes a Sasadan Samyagdarshi and again falls into Mithyatva. And in this way, everything done is ruined.

But it should be kept in mind that if the ascender of the Patan-oriented Upshama Shreni recovers upon reaching the sixth Gunasthana, he can again ascend the Upshama Shreni. Because the mention of ascending the Upshama Shreni twice in one Bhava is found. But the being who twice

**Adhakhanye Pasto Adhapavattoti Padi Hu Kamen. Sujjhato Arohadi Paddi So Sankilismato.**
-Samdhisar Ga. 310

Falls to the Adhakarana in the Upshama Shreni, if there are pure results afterwards, he ascends again to the higher Gunasthanas, and if there are Sanklesha results, he descends to the lower Gunasthanas.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

**Upasham Shreni** ascends, that being cannot experience **Kshapak Shreni** or **Arohan** in the same **Bhav**. One who ascends **Upasham Shreni** once, according to the **Karm Granthik** view, can also ascend **Kshapak Shreni** a second time. According to the **Sadhanthik** view, a being ascends only one **Shreni** in a single **Bhav**.

This is the general description of **Upasham Shreni**. Now, some specific clarifications are given below.

The **Gatha** describes the order of ascension of **Upasham Shreni** in relation to the being ascending **Shreni** from the rise of **Purusha Ved**. If a being ascends **Shreni** from the rise of **Stri Ved**, then it first performs **Upasham** of **Napunsak Ved**, and then in order, **Purusha Ved**, **Hasya** etc. **Shatk** and **Stri Ved**. If a being ascends **Shreni** from the rise of **Napunsak Ved**, then it first performs **Upasham** of **Stri Ved**, then in order, **Purusha Ved**, **Hapalik** and **Napunsak Ved**. In summary, the **Ved** from which the **Shreni** ascends, its **Upasham** is performed last. This is also explained in the **Vishesh Avashyak Bhashya** **Gatha** 1285:

...

**"It is said that those who perform Upasham twice, they are not bound by the rule of Kshapak Shreni in that Bhav. Those who perform Upasham once, they are bound by the rule of Kshapak Shreni."**

- **Pancham Karma Granth**, **Swopan Tika**, page 132

**"They do not attain liberation in that Bhav, they are bound to Samsara. Some wander for a long time, even for the duration of half a Pudgal Paravart."**

- **Vishesh Avashyak Bhashya**, 1315

**Upasham Shreni** descends, and the being cannot attain liberation from that **Bhav**. Some wander in **Samsara** for a long time, even for the duration of half a **Pudgal Paravart**.

Until
Then, the Darshanantaka is pacified, which is like a hot iron, burning the body. Then, the seed is pacified, then the Veda which is inferior, then the other Veda. Then, the Patka of laughter, etc., is pacified, and then the Veda which arises is pacified.
The order of pacification of Karma-prakriti is explained in verse 65 as follows:
Udayam Parijaya Ismi Iritham Samddha Arthaya Pt. Tah Varisharo Barisavarishi Samgam Kamar.
If the Stro is increasing on the Upshamani, then first the Napumsaka-veda is pacified, then all the Dalikas of the Stri-veda except the Udayasthiti, which is the last time. Then, when there is Abe-Kaph, the seven Prakritis, including the Purusha-veda, are pacified. If the Napumsaka is increasing on the Upshramani, then the remaining Napumsaka-veda, except the Udayasthiti, and the Stri-veda are pacified together. Then, when there is Aveda, the seven Prakritis, including the Purusha-veda, are pacified.
The beginning of the Upshamani is the Jiva who is in the seventh Gunasthan, and when the Anantanubandhi, Apratyakhyanavaran, Pratyakhyanavaran, Mithyatva, and Sabhyamithyatva are pacified, the seventh Gunasthan is attained. Because, when these arise, Samyaktva, etc., cannot be attained.
1. In Labdhisar also, the same rule is laid down according to the Karma-prakriti. See
Verses 361, 362.

## The Fifth Karma-Yanthra

**5**

In the Upashama Shreni, the Upashama of the Ananta-anubandhi, etc., is also done. Therefore, in such a situation, the reason for mentioning their Upashama again in the Upashama Shreni is that the attainment of Vedak Samyaktv, Deshacharitra, and Sakalcharitra is achieved through the Kshayopa-shama of the said natures. Therefore, before starting the Upashama Shreni, it is necessary to understand the Yoga-gana of the Unma-tahiti. That is why the Upashama of the Ananta-anubandhi, etc., is mentioned in the Upashama Shreni.

**The difference between Upashama and Kshayopa-shama**

In this context, one should also understand the nature of Upashama and Kshayopa-shama. Because Kshayopa-shama occurs due to the fear of the Karma-dalikas that have come into existence and the Upashama of the Karma that is present in the being. But Kshayopa-shama has this special feature that it has Pradesh-odaya of the Ghatak Karmas, and in Upashama, there is no Udaya of any kind, i.e., neither Pradesh-odaya nor Rasa-odaya. Even though Pradesh-odaya occurs in Kshayopa-shama, the reason why Samyaktv, etc., are not destroyed is that Udaya is of two types - Phala-odaya and Pradesh-odaya. But Phala-odaya causes the destruction of the Guna, and Pradesh-odaya, being very slow, does not cause the destruction of the Guna. Therefore, in the Upashama Shreni, the Upashama of the Ananta-anubandhi, etc., is considered to be of both types - Phala-odaya and Pradesh-odaya.

**Difference of opinion regarding the beginning of the Upashama Shreni**

There is also a difference of opinion regarding the beginning of the Upashama Shreni. Some Acharyas say that one of the four - Avirat, Deshavirat, Pramattavirat, and Apramattavirat - ascends the Upashama Shreni, and some consider the seventh Guna-sthana-vi Jeeva as the beginning.

The reason for this difference of opinion is that the Acharyas who consider the Upashama of the Darshan-mohaniya, i.e., the beginning of the second Upashama-Samyaktv, as the beginning of the Upashama Shreni... 

Page #423:

## Translation:

**The Beginning of the Upshama Shreni**

Those who consider the fourth and higher Gunasthanas as the beginning of the Upshama Shreni, believe that the beings residing in these Gunasthanas are the initiators of Upshama Shreni. This is because the attainment of Samyaktva, which is a part of Upshama, is possible only in the fourth and higher Gunasthanas. However, those Acharyas who consider the Upshama of Charitramohaniya, or the effort made to attain the Uparama of Charitra, as the starting point, believe that the beings residing in the seventh Gunasthan are the initiators of the Upshama Shreni. This is because the Yathapravrittakarana (the state of being in accordance with one's true nature) occurs only in the seventh Gunasthan.

**The Ascent of the Upshama Shreni**

Refer to page 387 for the order of ascent of the Upshama Shreni. This is how one should understand the nature of the Upshama Shreni. Now, we will describe the Kshapaka Shreni, which is attained in a sequential manner.

When the five antarayas, five jñānāvaranas and four darśanāvaranas are destroyed, the being becomes a Kevala Jnani.

**Gāthārtha** (Kṣapaka Śreṇi Bālā) The infinite anubandhi kaṣāyas, mithyātva mohaniya, mithya mohaniya, samyaktva mohaniya, three āyus, ekaindriya, vikalaindriya, styānaddhitrika, udyota nāma, tiryañcadvika, narakadvika, sthāvadvika, sādhāraṇa nāma, ātapa nāma, eight (second and third) kaṣāyas, napuṣaka veda, strīveda and -

hāsyādi ṣaṭka, puruṣa veda, sanjvalana kaṣāya, two nidrāyas, five antarayas, five jñānāvaranas, four darśanāvaranas, by destroying these natures, the being becomes a Kevala Jnani.

**Viśeṣārtha** - The names of the natures that the ārohaka of the kṣapaka śreṇi destroys are mentioned in the gāthā. The difference between the upasama śreṇi and the kṣapaka śreṇi is that the ārohakas of both these śreṇis are progressing to subdue and destroy the mohaniya karma, but in the upasama śreṇi, the arising of the natures is pacified, the essence of the natures remains, and they cannot bear their fruit for the final moment, but in the kṣapaka śreṇi, their very essence is destroyed, so there is no fear of their arising again. For this reason, there is no fall in the kṣapaka śreṇi. The essence of the above statement is that the central point of both the upasama śreṇi and the kṣapaka śreṇi is mohaniya karma, and in the upasama śreṇi, the pacification of mohaniya karma leads to its re-arising. This makes the parināmik śuddhi done during the fall useless. But in the kṣapaka śreṇi, the complete destruction of mohaniya karma prevents its re-arising, and the non-arising makes the parināmik śuddhi complete.

When the soul attains its pure form, it becomes a Kevala-Jnani.

The second difference between the Upshama Shreni and the Kshapaka Shreni is that in the Upshama Shreni, only the Mohaniya Karma is pacified, but in the Kshapaka Shreni, along with the Mohaniya Karma, some of the Nama Karma and the Karmas of Jnanavarana, Darshanavarana, and Antaray are also destroyed.

The order of destruction of the Karmas in the Kshapaka Shreni is as follows:

1. A person who is more than eight years old, possesses the highest Samhanana, and is in the fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh Gunasthan, begins the Kshapaka Shreni. First, they destroy the four Kashayas, which are Anantanu bandhi, all at once. Then, they establish the remaining infinite part of the Kashayas in Mithyatva and destroy both Mithyatva and that part together. After that, they destroy the Samyagmithyatva and Samyaktva Karmas in this order.

When only one Avali of Samyagmithyatva remains, the Samyaktva Mohaniya Karma remains for eight years.

**Pavitti e annayaru padivajji suddha jmanova gayachitto ||**

- **Visheshavashak Bhashya 1321**

In the Digambar Sampradaya, the person who ascends the Kshapaka Shreni is considered to be in the seventh Gunasthan, like the person who ascends the Upshama Shreni. This is because they are considered to be Pakani only after the destruction of the Charitramahima.

It remains. It consumes the proof-moments one by one. When it consumes the final state-moment, that consumption is called *kritakarna*. If a being dies during this *kritakarna* time, it is born in any one of the four destinies.
If the consumption begins with a bound-life being and it dies after the destruction of the *anantaanubandhi*, then in that state, upon the arising of *mithyatva*, the being again binds the *anantaanubandhi*, because it binds by the rule of *mithyatva*, but...

1. *Labdhisara* (in the Digambar Chandra, it is stated about the consumption of *darshanamoha*)

*Darshanamohapakhavanapatubago karmabhumijo manuso. Tisthayarapaadamule kevalisudakevalimule.* ||11||
*Ninago tatthana vimana bhogavanimu dhambe a.* ||111||
*Kidkaranijjo chadusuvigadisuu uppajade jamha.* ||111||

A *karmabhumij* human being begins the consumption of *darshanamoha* at the feet of a *tirthankara*, a *kevali*, or a *shrutakevali*. From the first moment of *adhakarana* until now, the *mithyatva* *mohaniya* and *mithya* *mohaniya* substances undergo a transformation in their nature, and the time of the *ansamuhurta* until then is called the initial time of the consumption of *darshanamoha*. And from that initial time onwards, until the first moment of the attainment of *shayik* *sampanattva*, the time is called *nisthapaka*. *Nisthapaka* is where it began, here it is in its *vaimanika* heaven, in its *bhogabhumi*, or in the first hell called *dharma*. Because a bound-life *kritakritya* *vedaka* *sammasthi* can be born in any of the four destinies after death.

When the fifth karma-grantha, Mithyatva, is destroyed, there is no further binding of the Anantanubandhi. Even if a being is bound to a lifespan, if it does not die at that time, after the destruction of the Anantanubandhi kshaya and Darshanamoha, it remains there and does not attempt to destroy the Pariva-mohaniya. If it is not bound to a lifespan, it attains Kevalgyan after ending that category. Therefore, for a human being who is not bound to a lifespan and who has ended all categories, the three lifespans - Deva-ayu, Naraka-ayu, and Tiryancha-ayu - are naturally absent, and the Anantanubandhi Chatushk and Darshan-trik are destroyed in the fourth and subsequent four Gृणस्थानs.

In this way, after destroying the Darshanamoha-saptak, it performs the three Karans - Yathapravritta, etc. - to destroy the Charitra-mohaniya. In the Apurva-karan, through Sthiti-ghat, etc., the Apratyakhyana-avaran kshaya Chatushk and Pratyakhyana-avaran kshaya Chatushk, a total of eight Prakṛtis, are destroyed in such a way that at the first moment of Anivritti-karan, their state remains only a fraction of an innumerable part of the Paly. After the innumerable parts of Anivritti-karan have passed, the four categories - Sthaman-dvitrik, Naraka-gati, Naraka-anupurvi, Tiryancha-gati, Tiryancha-anupurvi, Ekaindriya, Bikaleindriya-trik - and the sixteen Prakṛtis - Sthavar, Atap, Udyot, Sukshma, and Sadharan - are reduced to a fraction of an innumerable part of the Paly through Udvlana-samkran, and then, through Guna-samkran, they are completely destroyed by being projected into the bound Prakṛtis. Although the destruction of Apratyakhyana-avaran and Pratyakhyana-avaran kshaya begins earlier, they are not yet destroyed, and there is an interval... 

Page #429:
---------------------------
In the 392nd century, the aforementioned sixteen *prakritis* are destroyed, and after their destruction, the eight *kṣayās* are also destroyed in the same way. After that, it differentiates between the nine *mokṣāyas* and the four *sancalana kṣayās*. Then, it destroys the six *nokṣayās* in order: *napumsakaved*, *strīved*, and *hāsyādi*. After that, it destroys two parts of the *puruṣaved* together, and merges the third part with the *sanjvalana krodha*. This sequence is described for someone who ascends the *puruṣaved* *śreṇī*. If a woman ascends the *śreṇī*, she first destroys the *napumsakaved*, then the *puruṣaved*, the six *nokṣayās*, and finally the *strīved*. If a *napumsaka* ascends the *śreṇī*, he first destroys the *strīved*, then the *puruṣaved*, the six *nokṣayās*, and finally the *napumsakaved*. In summary, some believe that the destruction of the sixteen *prakritis* begins first, and the destruction of the eight *kṣayās* occurs in the middle, followed by the destruction of the sixteen *prakritis*. In the *Go. Karmakāṇḍa*, a different opinion is mentioned in this regard:

"There is no *anantānubandhī* in the *upaśama śreṇī*, and the *kṣapaka anivṛttikaraṇa* first destroys the eight *kṣayās* and then destroys the sixteen *prakritis* and so on, some say."

"In this way, the *napumsaka* arises, and in this way, the *strī* and the *sat* arise. The *napumsaka* arises from the *apumoda*, and the *strī* arises from the *napumsaka*." - *Paṇḍhasangraha* 346 (see next page)

## The Fifth Karma Granth

The **veda** which arises with the ascent of **śreṇi** is destroyed at the end.

After the destruction of the **veda**, the **sanjvalana** destroys **krodha**, **mana**, **māyā**, and **lobha** in the same way. That is, the **sanjvalana** destroys two of the three parts of **krodha** together, and merges the third part into **mana**. Similarly, it merges the third part of **mana** into **māyā**, and the third part of **māyā** into **lobha**. The time for the destruction of each is **ant-muhūrta**, and the time for the **śreṇi** is also **ant-muhūrta**, but it is a larger **ant-muhūrta**.

The **sanjvalana** destroys two of the three parts of **lobha** together, but it destroys the remaining parts of the third part, except for the last part, at different times. Then, it destroys the countless parts of that last part at different times in the tenth **guṇasthāna**. In this way, when the **lobha** **kaṣāya** is completely destroyed, it becomes **kṣīṇa-kaṣāya** after an infinite amount of time.

Until one part of the time of the **kṣīṇa-kaṣāya** **guṇasthāna** remains, **sthitighāta** etc. occur as before in all **karmas** except for **mohaniya**. In it, the **kṣīṇa-kaṣāya** makes the **five jñāna-āvaraṇa**, **four darśana-āvaraṇa**, **five antarāya**, and **two nidrā** (**nidrā** and **prachalā**) - these sixteen **prakṛti** - equal to the time of **kṣīṇa-kaṣāya**, but it makes the **nidrā-dvaya** equal to one time.

When the **aṇi** ascends with the arising of **strī-bandha**, first the **napumsaka veda** is destroyed, then the **strī-veda**, and then the **puṣpa-veda** and the **ṣaṭka** of **hāni** etc. are destroyed. When the **aṇi** ascends with the arising of the **napumsaka veda**, the **napumsaka veda** and the **strī-bandha** arise together. After that, the **puruṣa-veda** and the **ṣaṭka** of **hāsa** are destroyed. This same order is also mentioned in **Go. Dharma-kāṇḍa** **Gā. 388**. 

Page #431:

It diminishes. When their state becomes equal to this, the functions like *sthitighāt* etc. cease in them and the remaining *prakṛtis* continue. After the *kṣīṇakṣaya*, it destroys *nidrādvaya* in time and *kṣetra* destroys the fourteen *prakṛtis* in the final time and after that time, it becomes *sayogakevalī*.
Shataka
That *sayogakevalī* state is of a previous *koṭi* time, which is less than the last *hūrta* from the lowest and less than the best. In this time, they preach, wander etc. for the awakening of the *bhāvya* beings. If the state of their *vedanīya* etc. karmas is more than the *āyukarma*, then they perform *samudghāt* for their equation, i.e. to make the state of *vedanīya* etc. three *atrāti* karmas equal to the state of *āyukarma*. This is called *kevalīsamudghāt* and after that, they undertake to stop *yoga*. If the state of *vedanīya* etc. karmas is equal to *āyukarma*, then they do not perform *samudghāt*.
The undertaking to stop *yoga* is as follows: First, they stop *bādar manoyoga* by *bādar kāyayoga*, then they stop *bādar vacanayoga* and after that, they stop *bādar kāyayoga* by *sūkṣmakāya*, then *sūkṣma manoyoga*, then they stop *sūkṣma vacanayoga*. In this way, after stopping *bādar*, *sūkṣma manoyoga*, *vacanayoga* and *bādar kāyayoga*, they meditate on *sūkṣmakriyāpratipātī dhyāna* to stop *sūkṣmakāyayoga*. In that meditation, they perform *apavarṭana* of the remaining karmas except *āyukarma* till the final time of the *sayogi* state by *sthitighāt* etc. By doing so, the state of all karmas becomes equal to the time of the *ayogi* state in the final time. Here, it should be understood that...

The state of those karmas which do not arise in the ayogi state, decreases at one time.
In the final time of the Sayogkevali Gunasthan, one of the seven vedaniyas, either Saata or Asata, Audarik, Tejas, Karman, six institutions, first Sanhanan, Audarik Angopaang, Varnachatusk, Agurulghu, Upghāt, Paradhat, Ucchvas, Shubh and Ashubh Vihayogati, each, stable, unstable, Shubh, Ashubh, Suswar, Duswar and Nirman, the arising and udirana of these thirty prakritis are severed and after that time they become Ayogkevali. In this Ayogkevali state, they perform Byupert-kriya-pratipati dhyan. Here, there is no Sthitighāt etc., therefore, the karmas which arise, they destroy them by experiencing the decay of their state, but the prakritis which do not arise, they are transferred to the existing prakritis by Stibuksankram and they are experienced till the end time of the Ayogi state and at the end time, 72 prakritis are destroyed and at the end time, 13 prakritis are destroyed and they become Nirakar, Niranjan and attain the eternal bliss of Moksha.
This is how the nature of the Kshapak Shreni should be understood. Its digdarshak description is this

Appendix-2
The reason for the difference in the number of Karmas in their binding, arising and existence states - There are 120 binding, 122 arising and 158 existing states of the 148 _Jñānāvaraṇa_ etc. root Karmas. That is, there are 2 more arising states than binding states and 36 or 26 more existing states than arising states. Here we explain the reason for this difference.
Generally, in relation to the binding, arising and existence of Karma states, the rule is that the fewer the states that are bound, the fewer the states that arise and exist in the arising and existence periods after binding. Without binding, the number of arising and existing states should not be more. But due to an exception to this general rule, the number of Karma states in arising and existence is considered to be more.
The reason for the two more arising states than binding states is that there are three states of _varṣaṇ_ _mohaniya_ - _samyaktv_ _mohaniya_, _mitra_ _mohaniya_ and _mithyātva_ _mohaniya_. Of these, only _mithyātva_ _mohaniya_ is bound, and the remaining two states arise and exist without binding. The reason for this is that just as ashes and a special medicine are used to purify intoxicating grains (special grains), similarly, intoxicating grains like _mithyātva_ _mohaniya_ Karma are purified by _samyaktv_ like medicine and divided into three parts - 1. pure, 2. partially pure and 3. impure. Those that are completely purified, that is, those that have attained the _samyaktv_ state, that is, those that do not hinder the attainment of _samyaktv_, are called pure _pudgalas_ and their _samyaktv_ _mohaniya_ is called by this name and they have attained arūpa purity. Those that are partially purified are called _miśra_ _mohaniya_ and they have attained...

## Appendix-2

Those who have not attained even a little bit of right faith, but remain in the form of false faith and delusion, are called impure.

Thus, the **Samyaktva** (right faith) and **Mithya** (false faith) **Mohaniya** (delusion) karmas, being purified in their existence by the **Samyaktva** (right faith) **guna** (quality), do not bind, but the **Mithya** (false faith) **Mohaniya** (delusion) karma binds. Therefore, in the context of binding, twenty types of **Mohaniya** (delusion) karma are considered, excluding the **Samyaktva** (right faith) and **Mithya** (false faith) **Mohaniya** (delusion) karmas.

Similarly, the five **Bandhan** (bondage) and five **Sanghatan** (aggregation) karmas, being taken within their respective bodies, and the twenty divisions of **varna** (color) etc., being taken within the four **varna** (color) categories, are taken in the binding of the **Nama** (name) karma in its sixteen types, excluding the **vina** (without) types. And since there is no decrease or increase in the types of the remaining karmas, the total number of types in binding is one hundred and twenty.

In the context of **udaya** (arising), the **Samyaktva** (right faith) and **Mithya** (false faith) **Mohaniya** (delusion) karmas also arise, and their increase is considered to be one hundred and twenty-two types.

Although when considering binding and arising, the five types of **Bandhan** (bondage) and **Sanghatan** (aggregation) **Nama** (name) karmas are considered within their respective bodies, the five **Bandhan** (bondage) and five **Sanghatan** (aggregation) karmas bind and arise along with their respective **Nama** (name) karma bodies. Therefore, they are not considered separately in binding and arising, but are described separately in existence, and should be described. Because if they are not described in existence, the essence of the object will be lost. There will be no **Bandhan** (bondage) and **Sanghatan** (aggregation) karmas.

The five **Bandhan** (bondage) and five **Sanghatan** (aggregation) **Nama** (name) karmas are considered in the five types of **Nama** (name) karma bodies as follows: **Audarik Bandhan** (bondage of the **Audarik** body) and **Audarik Sanghatan** (aggregation of the **Audarik** body) are considered within the **Audarik** body, **Vaikriya Bandhan** (bondage of the **Vaikriya** body) and **Kriya Sanghatan** (aggregation of the **Kriya** body) are considered within the **Vaikriya** body, **Aharak Bandhan** (bondage of the **Aharak** body) and **Aharak Sanghatan** (aggregation of the **Aharak** body) are considered within the **Aharak** body, **Tejas Bandhan** (bondage of the **Tejas** body) and **Tejas Sanghatan** (aggregation of the **Tejas** body) are considered within the **Tejas** body, and **Karma Bandhan** (bondage of the **Karma** body) and **Karma Sanghatan** (aggregation of the **Karma** body) are considered within the **Karma** body.

## The Five Karma Granthya

The Karma Granthya, within the framework of the Sanghasana, has five, two, five, and eight sub-categories of the Karma body, respectively, under the categories of color, smell, taste, and touch. Their binding and arising are not specifically defined, but generally, only four categories, starting with color, are considered. This is because all twenty of these categories bind and arise together, with no single nature binding or arising earlier or later than the others. Therefore, only the four categories, starting with color, are considered in binding and arising.

Thus, in binding and arising, the five binding, five obstructing, and sixteen natures, starting with color, are considered to be present in existence, totaling forty-eight sub-natures. When fifteen categories are considered instead of the three categories of the binding Karma, then one hundred and forty-eight natures are considered to be present in existence.

The difference in the number of natures in binding, arising, and existence is based on the level of detail considered.

## The Mohaniya Karma in the Sub-Natures

The Karma Granthya mentions ten binding places for the Mohaniya Karma, with nine Bhuyaska, eleven Alpatar, ten Avasthit, and two Avaktvy binding categories. However, the Go. Karmakanda mentions twenty Bhuyaska, eleven Alpatar, thirty-three Avasthit, and two Avaktvy binding categories, which are explained in the following verse:

**Verse 468:**

"Ten, eleven, thirty-three, are the binding places of the Mohaniya Karma. The Bhuyaska, Alpatar, and Avasthit, and the two Avaktvy, are the categories."

The difference in this explanation between the Karma Granthya and the Karmakanda arises because the Karma Granthya focuses only on the ascent and descent of the qualities in the quality places, while the Karmakanda considers this aspect along with the possibility of the soul moving from one quality place to another during ascent and descent.

Appendix-2
Time can come from one Gunasthan to another Gunasthan. In addition to the death-related bond, other bonds like Bhupaskara are also mentioned.

The Karmagranth mentions the bond from one to two, two to three, three to four, etc., and mentions nine Bhupaskara bonds in ten bond-places. However, in Karmakanda, eleven more Bhupaskara bonds are mentioned besides these. They are as follows:

- A being binds 17 bonds by binding one bond in relation to death, 17 bonds by binding three bonds, 17 bonds by binding four bonds, and 17 bonds by binding five bonds. Therefore, these five Bhupaskara bonds are related to death.

- A being binds nine natures in the sixth Pramattasanyata Gunasthan and then binds 13 bonds in the fifth Gunasthan, 17 bonds in the fourth Gunasthan, 18 bonds in the second Gunasthan, and 22 bonds in the first Gunasthan. This is because a being can go to the lower Gunasthan from the sixth Pramattasanyata Gunasthan. Therefore, there are four Bhupaskara bonds of nine.

- Similarly, a being can bind 17, 21, and 22 bonds by binding 13 bonds in the fifth Gunasthan. Therefore, there are three Bhupaskara bonds of 13. A being can bind 21 and 22 bonds by binding 17 bonds. Therefore, there are two Bhupaskara bonds of 17.

- In this way, there are four Bhupaskara bonds of nine, three of 13, and two of 17. However, the Karmagranth mentions only one Bhupaskara bond for each bond-place, making a total of three. Therefore, six remain, and five Bhupaskara bonds related to death have already been mentioned. Thus, the Karmakanda mentions 5 + 6 = 11 more Bhupaskara bonds than the Karmagranth.

- The Karmagranth mentions eight Alpatara bonds, but the Karmakanda mentions eleven. They are as follows:

- The Karmagranth mentions only one Alpatara bond of 17 by binding 22. However, a being can go to all Gunasthan from the first to the seventh Gunasthan, except for the second and sixth Gunasthan. Therefore, there are three Alpatara bonds of 22 because it can bind 17, 13, and nine bonds by binding 22 natures. And 17...

## Pancham Karmagranth

**413**

Due to the ability to bind thirteen and nine, there are minor bonds in the bond-place of seventeen. Thus, in the twenty-two bond-places, there are three minor bonds in twenty-two and two in seventeen. However, Karmagranth mentions only one minor bond in Karmakaand. Therefore, the remaining three are more in Karmakaand than in Karmagranth.

If the same number of natures are bound in the second time of the **Bhuyaskaar**, **Alpatar**, and **Avaktvy** bonds as in the first time, then it is called an **Avasthit** bond. Therefore, Karmakaand mentions the number of **Avasthit** bonds equal to the number of **Bhuyaskaar**, **Alpatar**, and **Avaktvy** bonds. If we remove the **Bhuyaskaar**, **Alpatar**, or **Avaktvy** terms from the bonds that occur in the second time and look at their actual state, then the original **Avasthit** bonds can remain the same as the number of bond-places. For example, if a being binds twenty-two after binding twenty-one in the first time and also binds twenty-two in the second time, then this is a **Bhuyaskaar** bond of five times and an **Avasthit** bond of the second time.

If the **Avasthit** bond is described in the same way as the **Bhuyaskaar** etc. bonds, then binding twenty-two after binding twenty-two, binding twenty-one after binding twenty-one, binding seventeen after binding seventeen, etc. are all **Avasthit** bonds. The essence of this is that the original **Avasthit** bonds are the same as the number of bond-places. Therefore, Karmagranth mentions only ten **Avasthit** bonds for **Mohaniya Karma**. However, in the second time of **Bhuyaskaar**, **Alpatar**, and **Avaktvy** bonds, there is often an **Avasthit** bond. Therefore, the **Avasthit** bonds that occur with these prefixes are also the same as the number of these three bonds. This is why Karmakaand mentions the number of **Avasthit** bonds equal to the number of these three types of bonds.

**Avaktvy** bonds are the same in Karmagranth and Go Karmakaand.

Go Karmakaand specifically mentions **Bhuyaskaar** etc., whose number is as follows:

**Sasani Sahiyasayam Panvaalam Panchhatarihiyasayam. Munagaarappa Daragi Ya Ashituvaanivi Vishesena. ||1**

## Appendix-2

There are 127 *mujakar* bonds, 45 *alpatar* bonds, and 150 *pravaktvyabandh* bonds, specifically in comparison to *mangas*.

The variations that occur due to the change in the nature of the *prakritis* in the same *bandhasthan* are called *bhangas*. For example, in the 22 *prakritik* *anghaस्थान*, there is a bond of one *veda* out of the three *vedas* and one pair out of the pairs of *hasya-rati* and *shoka-arati*. Therefore, there are 343 = 6 *mangas*. That is, a being binds the 22 *prakritik* *bandhasthan* with *hasya*, *rati*, and *purushaveda*, another binds it with *ghoka*, *arati*, and *purushaveda*, another binds it with *hasya*, *rati*, and *striveda*, and another binds it with *shoka*, *arati*, and *striveda*. Similarly, one should understand it for *napunsakavedas*. In this way, the 22 *prakritik* *bandhasthan* occurs in six ways for different beings. Similarly, there are four *bhangas* in the 21 *prakritik* *bandhasthan*, because in it, a being at one time binds one *veda* out of the two *vedas* and one pair out of the two pairs. The summary of this is that in their respective *bandharayan*, the *sampatti* *vedas* and pairs are multiplied with each other, resulting in the *bhangas* of their respective *bandhasthan*. The number of these *bhangasthans* is as follows:

*Ambapo se badu igio se vo ho havati chhato ti.*
*Ekka mayo bhango bandhattanesu mohasse.* (467)

There are six *bhangas* for the 22 *mohaniya karma* *bandhasthans*, four for the 21, two for the *pramat* *gunasthan* onwards, and one for the *sanbhavit* *bandhasthans* onwards. In comparison to these *mangas*, the 127 *mujakar* are as follows:

*Nam chavisan baras bosan bajratuvo se vo ho.*
*Dhuli panagavona tipatiya micchadimujagara.* (472)

There is not a single *mujakar* bond in the first *gunasthan* because there is no *bandhasthan* with more *prakritis* than the 22 *prakritik* *bandhasthans*, which would make a *mujakar* bond possible here. In the second *gunasthan*, there are 24 *mujakars*, because when 21 is bound and 22 is bound, there are four *bhangas* of 21... 

Page #450:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma Granth

Multiplying the six bhangas of the twenty-two with the bhangas of the others, we get 445 = 24 mujakars. There are twelve mujakars in the third gunasthan, because binding the seventeen and binding the twenty-two results in 2 x 6 = 12 bhangas. In the fourth, there are twenty mujakars, because binding the seventeen and binding the twenty-one results in 244 - and binding the aim ma results in 2 x 6 = 12, thus 12 + 8 = 20 bhangas. In the fifth gunasthan, there are twenty-four mujakars, because binding the thirteen and binding the seventeen results in 242 = 4, binding the twenty-one results in 244 = 8, and binding the twenty-two results in 246 = 12, thus 4 + 8 + 12 = 24 bhangas. In the sixth, there are twenty-eight mujakars, because binding the nine and binding the thirteen results in 2224, binding the seventeen results in 242 = 4, binding the twenty-one results in 244, and binding the twenty-two results in 246 = 12, thus 4 + 4 + 8 + 12 = 28 bhangas. In the seventh, there are two mujakars, because in the seventh, binding the nine with one bhang and dying results in binding the seventeen with two bhangas. In the eighth gunasthan, there are also two mujakars, the same as in the seventh. In the ninth gunasthan, there are three mujakars each in the five bandhastanas of five, four, etc., which are due to the falling of one and the dying of two. Thus, there are one hundred and twenty-seven mujakar bandhas.

The forty-five alpatar bandhas are as follows:

Appadara pun tisam nam pam chhatoni boni nam ev. Yule panagavone ekavark antim sune. || 473

In the first gunasthan, there are thirty alpatar bandhas. From the second gunasthan onwards, up to the apurvakaran gunasthan, the alpatar bandhas are zero, zero, 6, 2, 2, zero, 1 in nature. In the ninth gunasthan, there is one alpatar bandha of the nature of pan, etc., but in the fifth part of the end, there is zero, i.e., no alpatar bandha. The explanation is as follows:

In the first mithyatva gunasthan, there are thirty alpatar bandhas, because binding the twenty-two and binding the seventeen results in 6 x 2 = 12, binding the thirteen results in 6 x 2...

Appendix-2
- When 12 and 2 are bound, 6x6, thus 12+1+6= 30 are destroyed. In the second gunasthana, there is not a single alpantar bandha, because after the second, the first gives gunaranan and in the ma bastha, it makes a bandha of twenty-two by binding with prati, which is a bhujakar bandha. In the third gunasthana also, there is no alpantar, because when it comes to the gunasthana before the third, there is a bhujakar bandha and when it goes to the fourth, there is an avasthit bandha. Because in the third, there is also a bandhasthana of seventeen and in the fourth, there is also a bandha of seventeen. In the fourth, there are six alpantar, because when it binds with seventeen and makes a bandha of thirteen, 242-4 and when it binds with nine, 241-2, thus 4+2= 6 alpantar bandha. In the fifth gunasthana, when it binds with thirteen and goes to the seventh, it makes a bandha of nine, therefore there are 241-2 alpantar bandha. In the sixth gunasthana also, there are two alpantar, because when it comes to the gunasthana below the sixth, there is only a bhujakar bandha, but when it goes up to the seventh, there are two alpantar bandha. Although in the sixth and seventh gunasthana, there is a bandha of nine-nine prakritis, but in the bandhasthana of nine prakritis of the sixth, there are two bhangas, because here both the mugal bandha are possible and in the bandhasthana of nine prakritis of the seventh, there is only one bhang, because there is only one yugal bandha. Due to which, even though the number of prakritis is equal, the bhangas have been considered as 241-2 alpantar bandha due to the difference in their number. In the seventh gunasthana, there is not a single alpantar bandha, because when the jiva goes from the seventh to the eighth gunasthana, it also makes a bandha of nine prakritis, not less. In the eighth, when it binds with nine and makes a bandha of five in the ninth gunasthana, there is only 1x1=1 alpantar bandha. In the ninth gunasthana, when it binds with five and makes a bandha of four, there is one, when it binds with four and makes a bandha of three, there is one, when it binds with three and makes a bandha of two, there is one and when it binds with two and makes a bandha of one, there is one, thus there are four alpantar bandha. Thus, one should understand forty-five alpantar bandha. The avaktva bandha is as follows:
Meren avattva oparamanammi ekary marage. Goev hoti elya vi visnech mathia anga. || 474

## The Fifth Karma Granth

**Regarding the specific details of the Mag's Vivaksha, the subtle bondage of the Samprayaya Gunasthan is to be understood as follows:**

There is one Avaktvyabandh when a being descends from the tenth Gunasthan to the ninth Gunasthan. This means that when a being descends to the ninth Gunasthan from the tenth Gunasthan and binds one nature, it is considered one Avaktvyabandh. Similarly, when a being dies in the tenth Gunasthan and takes birth in the Devagati, it binds the Sabha, resulting in two Avaktvyabandh. Therefore, we should consider three Avaktvyabandh.

**Explanation:**

When a being descends from the tenth Gunasthan to the ninth Gunasthan, it binds the Sanjwalan Lobha, resulting in one Avaktvyabandh. If the same being dies in the tenth Gunasthan and becomes a Dev Asanyata, then there are two Avaktvyabandh because the Dev binds the 17 Prakruti in two ways. This makes a total of three Avaktvyabandh.

**Summary:**

The 127 Bhujakar, 45 Alpatar, and 3 Avaktvyabandh together make 175, which is the same number of Avashthitabandh. Therefore, we should understand the Bhujakar and other types of bondage as the general and specific forms of Mohaniya Karma.

**Regarding the Jghanya Sthitibandh of Karma Prakruti:**

The Karma Granth, the Go Karmakand, and the Karma Granth all agree on the Jghanya Sthitibandh of the Karma Prakruti mentioned by name. Regarding the remaining 85 Prakruti, there are some points to consider.

**Go Karmakand states:**

"Sesanan Parmato Badarai Diyo Vimukho Pa. Bandi Savajahmanam Sagasamakasaspadhimage." (Verse 143)

This verse states that the Jghanya Sthiti of the remaining Prakruti is bound by the Ekendriya Jiva in their respective participation in the highly purified result of the Badara.

**Explanation:**

The participation mentioned in this verse is explained in verse 145. The Jghanya and Utkrishta Sthiti of the mentioned Prakruti, in comparison to the Ekendriya and other Jivas, is determined by the participation of the Ekendriya in the Utkrishta Sthiti of Mithyatva. This participation is achieved by the Ekendriya's Utkrishta Sthiti, and the Jghanya Sthiti is achieved by the Ekendriya's participation in the countless parts of the Paly. Therefore, the Jghanya Sthitibandh is not separately mentioned in the Karmakand because it is bound by the Ekendriya Jiva.

## Appendix-2

It was previously indicated that to determine the inferior state of the remaining natures in the Karma-prakriti, a class should be created and a portion of the superior state of Mithyatva should be given.

Further, while explaining the magnitude of the state of the natures in comparison to the one-sensed being, it is written:

"Asegi Diyahare Samvasi Unasanjuo Jatto." This means that by dividing the superior state of each nature by the superior state of Mithyatva and then subtracting an innumerable part of the Palya from the quotient, the inferior state of each nature is obtained. This should be understood as the measure of the inferior state of the one-sensed being. By adding the innumerable part of the Palya that was subtracted to the inferior state, the measure of the superior state is obtained.

In the Karma-grantha, the inferior state of the eighty-five natures has been discussed according to both the Pancha-sangraha and the Karma-prakriti. The difference between these two discussions is that in the Pancha-sangraha, the inferior state is determined by dividing the superior state of each nature by the superior state of Mithyatva. However, in the Karma-prakriti, the inferior state is determined by dividing the superior state of each nature by the superior state of Mithyatva and then subtracting an innumerable part of the Palya from the quotient.

The Go. Karma-kanda agrees with the Pancha-sangraha's view until the point of dividing the state of the natures. However, it then agrees with the Karma-prakriti's view. The Pancha-sangraha's view is that the quotient obtained by dividing the superior state of the natures is the inferior state in comparison to the one-sensed being. Adding an innumerable part of the Palya to this quotient results in the superior state. However, according to the Go. Karma-kanda and the Karma-prakriti, the quotient obtained by dividing the superior state of each nature by the superior state of Mithyatva is the superior state. Subtracting an innumerable part of the Palya from this quotient results in the inferior state.

In the Pancha-sangraha, the superior state of each class is not divided. Instead, the quotient obtained by dividing the superior state of each nature by the superior state of Mithyatva is the measure of the inferior state.

## The Fifth Chapter of the Karma Granth

**416. The difference between the five aggregates and the nature of karma.**

**Explanation of the uninterrupted period of the lifespan karma.**

When explaining the excellent state of lifespan (āyu) for gods, hell beings, animals, and humans, the uninterrupted period (abādhākāla) is said to be one-third of the previous lifespan. The reason for this is that humans and animals with a lifespan of a previous kalpa (eon) can bind the excellent lifespan of gods and hell beings, which is equivalent to thirty-three oceans, at the beginning of the third part of their lifespan after two-thirds of their lifespan has passed. Therefore, the indication is that the uninterrupted period is one-third of the previous lifespan along with the excellent state.

However, the state of lifespan karma is not explained by adding the uninterrupted period, as it is with other karmas. This is because the uninterrupted period of lifespan karma is not fixed. Humans and animals with a lifespan of countless years, as well as gods and hell beings, bind the lifespan of the next birth when six months of their lifespan remain. Those with a lifespan of countless years, but without any merit (nirūpakramī), bind the lifespan of the next birth at the beginning of the third part of their lifespan after two-thirds of their lifespan has passed. Those with a lifespan of countless years, but with merit (sopkramī), bind the lifespan of the next birth at the beginning of the third part of their lifespan after two-thirds of their lifespan has passed. If they do not bind the lifespan at that time, they bind it at the beginning of the third part of the remaining lifespan.

This means that they bind the lifespan of the next birth at the third part, ninth part, twenty-seventh part, and so on, until the last moment of their lifespan remains. After binding the lifespan of the next birth, the remaining lifespan is the uninterrupted period.

The uninterrupted period can be inferior, and the lifespan bound can be inferior, as in the case of someone with a lifespan of a single moment binding a lifespan of a single moment. The uninterrupted period can be inferior, and the lifespan bound can be excellent, as in the case of someone with a lifespan of a single moment binding the lifespan of a hell being, which is equivalent to thirty-three oceans, like a fish in the ocean. The uninterrupted period can be excellent, and the lifespan bound can be inferior, as in the case of someone with a lifespan of a previous kalpa binding a lifespan of a single moment at the beginning of the third part of their lifespan. The uninterrupted period can be excellent, and the lifespan bound can be excellent, as in the case of someone with a lifespan of a previous kalpa binding the lifespan of a god, which is equivalent to thirty-three oceans, at the beginning of the third part of their lifespan.

Appendix-2
The bondage of the age of hell. In this way, there is a co-destruction of the Ayukarma in the matter of unobstructedness. In this way, since unobstructedness is uncertain, it is not associated with the age! And other karmas strengthen the places of their own kind of karmas by their bondage, and if they arise, then after the destruction of all the new karmas bound to that caste, their destruction also takes place by excitation, but this rule does not apply to Ayukarma. The age that is bound does not strengthen even one place of the age that is to be enjoyed, and if a man binds the age of his own kind while enjoying the age, then that bound age is enjoyed only by going to another human birth. Here, even if there is no rise or excitation of any of its dalikas, there is no association of unobstructedness with the age.
Discussion of Yogasthanas
In the same way as the Kamangray, the Yogasthanas have been discussed in terms of their nature, number and master in the Go: Karmakanda Ga. 218 to 242. Its useful part is presented here.  _ In the Golakarmakanda, there are three types of Yogasthanas, and there are fourteen-fourteen types of these three types in relation to the fourteen Jivasamasas, and these fourteen types are also of three types in relation to the general, the inferior and the excellent. Of these, there are 14 types in relation to the general, 28 types in relation to the general and others, and 42 types in relation to the general, the inferior and the excellent. In total, there are 84 types. Their names etc. are as follows:
Jogatthana tiviha upadeyansaddhiparinama.
Meda ekkevaphi ghodasabheva puno tiviha ||218 Upapada Yogasthan, Ekantadhi Yogasthan and Parinama Yogasthan, in this way there are three types of Yogasthanas, and these three types are also fourteen-fourteen types in relation to Jivasamas, and they also have three-three types.
The yoga that occurs in the movement of the body is called 'Upapada Yogasthan'. The Yogasthan that occurs until the body is fully fulfilled is called Ekantaanudhi and the body

## The Fifth Karma:

**The state of the result (Parinaama Yogaasthaana)** is the state that occurs from the time of attaining perfection until the end of life. The state of the result can be both excellent and inferior. Both states of the result are possible for the one who has attained perfection, in all the variations of their state. Therefore, all these states of the result should be understood as **Potmaan Yoga**, because they can decrease, increase, or remain the same.

**The time of commencement of the states of the result (Parinaama Yogaasthaana) and the state of continuous increase (Ekaantaanuvrudhi Yogaasthaana)** is the same, whether it is inferior or excellent. Because the state of the result occurs at the very first moment of birth, and the state of continuous increase also occurs at different times, in the form of different understandings. And the states of the result, which are different from these two, have a continuous commencement time from two moments to eight moments. The states that have a continuous commencement for eight moments are the fewest, and those that have a commencement from seven to four moments are countless in both directions, above and below. But the states that have a commencement for three moments and two moments are only in the upward direction, and their number is countless, countless times.

**All the states are as numerous as the countless parts of the universe (Jagat Shreni).** Each state has five variations: 1. **Aavibhaag Pratichhed**, 2. **Varg**, 3. **Vargana**, 4. **Swak**, 5. **Gunahani**.

**Aavibhaag Pratichhed** is the part of the power that has no second part. The collection of **Aavibhaag Pratichhed** is called **Varg**, the collection of **Varg** is called **Vargana**, the collection of **Vargana** is called **Spardhak**, and the collection of **Spardhak** is called **Gunahani**. The collection of **Gunahani** is called **Sthaana**.

**In one state, the number of Gunahani is as numerous as the countless parts of the universe (Paly).** And in one **Gunahani**, the number of **Spardhak** is as numerous as the countless parts of the universe (Jagat Shreni). In one **Spardhak**, the number of **Vargana** is as numerous as the countless parts of the universe (Jagat Shreni). And in one **Vargana**, there are countless **Varg** as numerous as the universe (Jagat Prater). And in one **Varg**, there are countless **Aavibhaag Pratichhed** as numerous as the universe (Lok).

Appendix-2
In one yogasthan, the number of all swadhanakas, all varganas, and the extent (time) of guna-hani in countless regions is only a fraction of the countless in the general jagatva. Because there are many types of countless. In one yogasthan, there are countless lokapramanas of avibhag pratichhed.
The yogasthanas mentioned above, in terms of the lowest and highest of the fourteen jivasamamas, and in terms of the nine types of yogas like uppapada, etc., are now being explained in eighty-four places in terms of their relative importance.
Suhamagara sijahaṇam tishiṇasvarasijahanaym tatto.
Lasiapupṣṇapakasssa cādaralavissa agharamako. || 233 The lowest upamada-sthana of the sukshma nigodhya labdhyagaryaptak jiva is the smallest. From that, the lowest uppapada-sthana of the sukshma nigodhya nivrutyappaptik jiva is a fraction of the countless. From that, the highest uppapada-yogasthan of the sukshma layaparyaptak is greater, and from that, the lowest uppapada-yogasthan of the vadar labdhyaparyaptak should be considered.
Misṣyattisūhamajetuṁ māvaraṇiyattipassa avaraṁ tu.
Bādaralakhiṣṣa vara poi viyaladvigamahaṇam || 234 Then, from that, the highest uppapada-yogasthan of the sukshma nityaparyaptak jiva is greater. From that, the lowest yogasthan of the badar nivrutyaparyaptak is greater, from that, the highest yogasthan of the babar lanyaparyaptak is greater, from that, the lowest yogasthan of the hindriya labdhyaparyaptak is greater.
Bāvaraṇiyattivaraṁ ṇitimi diyaṣṣa avaramayo.
Evaṁ citivitītiścati ca ghadhimaṇo hodi ghaudhimaṇo || 235 After that, from that, the highest yogasthan of the badar ekendriya nityaparyapnak is greater, from that, the lowest yogasthan of the hindriya nirvatyaparyaptak is greater, and in the same way, the highest of the triendriya lakshyaparyaptak, the lowest of the triendriya nabbyaparyaptak, the highest of the dwiendriya nityaparyaptak, the lowest of the triendriya nivrutyaparyaptak, the highest of the triendriya labdhi-aparyaptak,

## Fifth Form Granth

It is important to know the order of the **Upāpad Yogasthāna** (stages of liberation) in increasing order of merit:

* **Tri-Indriya Nitya Paryāptak** (three-sense, eternally perfect) is superior to **Chatur-Indriya Labdhi-A-Paryāptak** (four-sense, imperfectly liberated).
* **Chatur-Indriya Nirvṛṣa-Paryāptak** (four-sense, perfectly liberated) is inferior to **Chatur-Indriya Labdhi-Paryāptak** (four-sense, imperfectly liberated).
* **Asanji Pancha-Indriya Sadhya-Paryāptak** (non-conscious, five-sense, conditionally perfect) is inferior to **Chatur-Indriya Nitya-Paryāptak** (four-sense, eternally perfect).
* **Asanji Pancha-Indriya Nitya-Paryāptak** (non-conscious, five-sense, eternally perfect) is inferior to **Sanji Pancha-Indriya Sadhya-Paryāptak** (conscious, five-sense, conditionally perfect).

Similarly, it is important to know the order of the **Upāpad Yogasthāna** in increasing order of merit:

* **Sanji Labdhi-Paryāptak** (conscious, imperfectly liberated) is inferior to **Asanji Sadhya-Paryāptak** (non-conscious, conditionally perfect).
* **Sanji Nitya-Paryāptak** (conscious, eternally perfect) is inferior to **Asanji Nitya-Paryāptak** (non-conscious, eternally perfect).
* **Sanji Pancha-Indriya Sadhya-Paryāptak** (conscious, five-sense, conditionally perfect) is inferior to **Asanji Nitya-Paryāptak** (non-conscious, eternally perfect).
* **Eka-Indriya Labdhi-Paryāptak** (one-sense, imperfectly liberated) is inferior to **Asanji Pancha-Indriya Sadhya-Paryāptak** (non-conscious, five-sense, conditionally perfect).

The **Eka-Indriya Labdhi-Paryāptak** (one-sense, imperfectly liberated) is **infinitely** more subtle than the **Asanji Pancha-Indriya Sadhya-Paryāptak** (non-conscious, five-sense, conditionally perfect).

Similarly, it is important to know the order of the **Upāpad Yogasthāna** in increasing order of merit:

* **Eka-Indriya Nitya-Paryāptak** (one-sense, eternally perfect) is inferior to **Sanji Pancha-Indriya Nitya-Paryāptak** (conscious, five-sense, eternally perfect).
* **Bādar Eka-Indriya Labdhi-Paryāptak** (gross one-sense, imperfectly liberated) is inferior to **Eka-Indriya Nitya-Paryāptak** (one-sense, eternally perfect).
* **Bādar Eka-Indriya Nitya-Paryāptak** (gross one-sense, eternally perfect) is inferior to **Eka-Indriya Labdhi-Paryāptak** (one-sense, imperfectly liberated).

The **Bādar Eka-Indriya Nitya-Paryāptak** (gross one-sense, eternally perfect) is **infinitely** more subtle than the **Eka-Indriya Labdhi-Paryāptak** (one-sense, imperfectly liberated).

Similarly, it is important to know the order of the **Upāpad Yogasthāna** in increasing order of merit:

* **Eka-Indriya Labdhi-Paryāptak** (one-sense, imperfectly liberated) and **Eka-Indriya Nirvṛṣa-Paryāptak** (one-sense, perfectly liberated) are inferior to **Sanji Pancha-Indriya Nitya-Paryāptak** (conscious, five-sense, eternally perfect).
* **Bādar Eka-Indriya Labdhi-Paryāptak** (gross one-sense, imperfectly liberated) and **Bādar Eka-Indriya Nitya-Paryāptak** (gross one-sense, eternally perfect) are inferior to **Eka-Indriya Labdhi-Paryāptak** (one-sense, imperfectly liberated) and **Eka-Indriya Nirvṛṣa-Paryāptak** (one-sense, perfectly liberated).
* **Bādar Eka-Indriya Nitya-Paryāptak** (gross one-sense, eternally perfect) is superior to **Eka-Indriya Nirvṛṣa-Paryāptak** (one-sense, perfectly liberated).

The **Bādar Eka-Indriya Nitya-Paryāptak** (gross one-sense, eternally perfect) is **infinitely** more subtle than the **Eka-Indriya Nirvṛṣa-Paryāptak** (one-sense, perfectly liberated).

Appendix-2
The first difference between the inferior result yogasthan of the ekendriya lanthya-paryaptak and the jagat-treni, is the countless parts of the pulp. There is no syami for these places. Because these places do not belong to any living being, this difference arises. Excluding these places, the subtle ekendriya and badar ekendriya lanthya-paryaptak, their inferior and superior result yogasthan should be known as countless parts of the pulp.

## The Supreme Karmagrantha

**424**

The Supreme Karmagrantha has explained the two granthas. There is also a difference in the order of the two granthas. Inquisitive people should investigate the reasons for this difference. The division of the acquired karma-skandhas into their fundamental natures is called **rothi**.

The fifth **karmagrantha** (verse 76, 80) only explains the order of the division of the acquired karma-skandhas, stating that **ayukarma** receives the least share, **nama** and **gotra karma** receive more than that, **antaraya**, **bhavana-avaran**, and **darshanavaran** receive more than that, and **mohaniya** receives more than **antaraya** etc. And the share of **vedaniya karma** is more than **mohaniya karma**. This way, it is only known that a particular karma receives a larger share and another karma receives a smaller share. But the **karmakanda** explains the method of division along with this order. It is as follows:

Like the **karmagrantha**, the **gola karmagrantha** also explains the order of the division of the acquired karma-skandhas into their fundamental natures, stating that except for **vedaniya**, the division of the substance of the other fundamental natures occurs according to their position.

**164** Except for **vedaniya**, the substance of the remaining fundamental natures is divided according to their position. The one with a higher position receives more, the one with a lower position receives less, and the one with an equal position receives an equal share of the substance. And in dividing them, one should understand the **pratibhagahar** rule as an innumerable number of parts of **avali**.

The order of division in the remaining seven karmas, **ayu** etc., is as follows:

**162** In all the fundamental natures, the share of **ayukarma** is small. The share of **nama** and **gotra karma** is equal to each other, but it is more than the share of **ayukarma**. **Antaraya**, ...

Appendix-2
।
Bhaṇāvaraṇa, Darśanāvaraṇa, these three types of karma are similar in their essence, but their names and gotra are different.  More than these, there is the Mohaniya karma, and even more than that is the Vedaniya karma.  Wherever there is a bunch of karma, it should be divided into as many parts as there are karmas.  The method of division is as follows:
"Bahumāge samajhāgo aham hovi eṣakamamhi.
Uttakamo taravi bahu bhāgo a'jhuga'ssa vebho bu." (165)
The eight karmas should be given one part each by dividing the Bahumāga into equal parts.  The remaining one part should be divided again into Bahumāga, and that Bahumāga should be given to the karma with the most parts.  According to this method, one should take the countless parts of the Āvali and divide the number of pudgala dravya that binds at one time, keeping one part separate.  Then, the eight parts of the Bahumāga should be given to the eight karmas, one part each.  The remaining one part should be divided again by the countless parts of the Āvali, keeping one part separate, and that Bahumāga should be given to the Vedaniya karma, as it is the owner of the largest part.  The remaining part should be divided again by the countless parts of the Āvali, keeping one part separate, and that Bahumāga should be given to the Mohaniya karma, as it has a larger share.  The remaining one part should be divided again by the countless parts of the Āvali, keeping one part separate, and that Bahumāga should be divided into three equal parts, giving one part each to Bhaṇāvaraṇa, Darśanāvaraṇa, and Aṃsarāya karma.  The remaining one part should be divided again by the countless parts of the Āvali, keeping one part separate, and that Bahumāga should be divided into two equal parts, giving one part each to Nāma and Gotra karma.  The remaining one part should be given to Āyuka.  In this way, by collecting the dravya obtained in the first and second divisions, the quantity of each part is obtained.  That is, the number of atoms in the received dravya is the form of that karma.
The above statement is explained by an example.  The quantity of pudgala dravya that binds at one time is 25600, and the Āvali is... 

Page #462:
---------------------------
The proportion of the four **Panchama Karmas** is 4. Therefore, dividing 25600 by 4, we get 6400, which is one part. Subtracting this one part from 25600, we get 19200, which is the **Bahubhag**. Dividing this **Bahubhag** into eight equal parts, each part becomes 2400. Therefore, each **Karma** receives 2400 **dravya**. The remaining one part, 6400, is divided by 4, giving us 1600. Subtracting this 1600 from 6400, we get 4800, which is the **Bahubhag** for **Vedaniya Karma**. The remaining 1600 is divided by 4, giving us 400. Subtracting this 400 from 1600, we get 1200, which is the **Bahubhag** for **Mohaniya Karma**. The remaining one part, 400, is divided by 4, giving us 100. Subtracting this 100 from 400, we get 300. This **Bahubhag** of 300 is divided into three equal parts, giving 100 each to **Jnanacharan**, **Darshanavaran**, and **Antaraya**. The remaining 100 is divided by 4, giving us 25. Subtracting this 25 from 100, we get 75. This **Bahubhag** is divided into two equal parts, giving **Nama** and **Gotra Karma** each 37.5. The remaining one part, 25, is given to **Ayukarma**. Therefore, each **Karma** receives the following **dravya**:

- **Vedaniya**: 2400
- **Mohaniya**: 2400
- **Jnanavaran**: 2400
- **Ayukarma**: 2400
- **Darshanavaran**: 2400
- **Antaraya**: 2400
- **Nama**: 2400
- **Gotra**: 2400

Thus, 25600 is distributed among the **Karmas** in this proportion. This example is only to explain the framework of division, but the actual...

##  Appendix-2

**Vik should not be understood.** Water should not be understood as being exactly twice the amount of Vedaniya, just as it is not actually twice the amount.

This example makes it clear that there is similarity between the Svetambara and Digambara karma literature in the division of karma-skandhas. The method of dividing according to the perspective of Ladhava has not been explained in the karma-grantha. The discussion of the distribution and predominance of pudgala dravya in the Uttar-prakritis is as follows:

In the Go. Karmakanda, from GAPA 166 to 206, the division of pudgala dravya in the Uttar-prakritis is described. Similar to the karma-grantha, the portion that the ghatikarma receives, out of that, the infinite portion is sarvaghati dravya and the remaining majority portion is deshaghati dravya.

**Samvaavaranam navam agantbhaago moolappadiinam. Sesaa asamagaa desaavaranam have ka. || 167 Go. Karmakanda**

According to the Go. Karmakanda, sarvaghati dravya is received by both sarvaghati and deshaghati prakritis.

**Samvaavaranam bachvam vibhanjanijnan tu ubhappapayadisuu. Besaaharanama vanvam desaavaranesu vidare. || 166**

The division of sarvaghati dravya should be done in both types of prakritis. However, the division of deshaghati dravya should be done only in deshaghati prakritis. In other words, sarvaghati dravya is received by both sarvaghati and deshaghati prakritis, but deshaghati dravya is only divided among deshaghati prakritis.

A general rule for dividing the received dravya among the Uttar-prakritis is:

**Uttarpayadosu puno mohaavaranaa havanti honakam. Ahiyakaama pum naamaabhidhaa pa pa manjam selee 196**

## Fifth Karma Granthya

**426**

In the **Mohaniya** (Attractive) **Prakritis**, the **Jnanabaran** (Knowledge-Obscuring), **Darshanabaran** (Perception-Obscuring) have **no division** in their **Dravyas** (Substances) in a sequential manner. However, in the **Nama** (Name), **Antaray** (Obstruction) **Karmas**, the **Dravyas** are **more or less** in quantity. The remaining **Vedaniya** (Painful), **Gotra** (Lineage), **Ayu** (Lifespan) **Karmas** have **no division** in their **Dravyas**. This is because they are bound by **one Prakruti** at **one time**. For example, in **Vedaniya**, either **Sata Vedaniya** (True Painful) or **Asata Vedaniya** (False Painful) is bound, but not both simultaneously. Therefore, the **Dravyas** of these three **Karmas** should be understood based on the **Dravyas** of the **Mula-Prakruti** (Root-Nature).

**The method of division is as follows:**

**Jnanabaran:** In the **Sarvaghati** (All-Destroying) **Dravya**, divide the **Avali** (Infinite) into **infinite parts**. Take one part and divide the remaining **Bahubhag** (Majority) into **five equal parts**. Allocate one part to each of the **five Prakrutis**. In the remaining one part, divide the **Avali** into **infinite parts**. Take one part and allocate it to **Matijnanabaran**. In the remaining one part, again divide the **Avali** into **infinite parts**. Take one part and allocate it to **Shruta Jnanabaran**. In the remaining one part, again divide the **Avali** into **infinite parts**. Take one part and allocate it to **Avadhi Jnanabaran**. Similarly, allocate the fourth **Bahubhag** to **Manparyaya Jnanabaran** and the remaining one part to **Keval Jnanabaran**. By combining their respective **Bahubhags** with the initial part, the **Sarvaghati Dravyas** of **Matijnanabaran** etc. are obtained.

Except for the **infiniteth part**, the remaining **Bahubhag Dravyas** are **Deshghati** (Region-Destroying). This **Deshghati Dravya** is allocated to the remaining four **Deshghati Prakrutis** except **Keval Jnanabaran**. The method of division is the same as before. That is, in the **Deshghati Dravya**, divide the **Avali** into **infinite parts**. Keep one part separate and divide the remaining **Bahubhag** into **four equal parts**. Allocate one part to each of the four **Prakrutis**. In the remaining one part, divide the **Avali** into **infinite parts**. Take one part and allocate it to **Matijnanabaran**. Similarly, allocate the remaining **Bahubhags** to **Shruta Jnanabaran**, **Avadhi Jnanabaran**, and **Manparyaya Jnanabaran** in sequence. By combining their respective **Sarvaghati** and **Deshghati Dravyas**, the total quantity of their respective **Dravyas** is obtained.

**Darshanabaran:** In the **Sarvaghati Dravya**, divide the **Avali** into **infinite parts**. Keep one part separate and divide the remaining **Bahubhag** into **nine parts**. Allocate these nine parts to **Darshanabaran**. 

Page #465:
---------------------------
Appendix-2

The **Prakṛtis** should be given one part each. In the remaining one part, the **Avali** should be divided into innumerable parts and the **Bahubhāga** should be extracted by dividing it. The first **Bahubhāga** should be given to **Styānadi**, the second to **Nidrā-Nidā**, the third to **Prachalā-Prachalā**, the fourth to **Nidrā**, the fifth to **Prachalā**, the sixth to **Chakshudānnāchāraṇa**, the seventh to **Achakshuparshnāvaraṇa**, the eighth to **Avidhidarshnāvaraṇa**, and the remaining one part to **Kevaladarshnāvaraṇa**. Similarly, in the **Deśapāti** substance, the **Avali** should be divided into innumerable parts and one part should be kept separate. The **Bahubhāga** should be divided into three equal parts and one part each should be given to **Deśaghāti Chakshudarshnāvaraṇa**, **Achakshudarshnāvaraṇa**, and **Avidhidarshnāvaraṇa**. In the remaining one part, the **Bahubhāga** should be divided again and the **Chakshudarshnāvaraṇa** should be given this **Bahubhāga**, the **Achakshudarshnāvaraṇa** should be given this **Bahubhāga**, and the remaining one part should be given to **Avidhidarshnāvaraṇa**. By collecting their respective parts, the amount of their respective substances is obtained. The substance of **Chakshu**, **Achakshu**, and **Avidhi** **Darshnāvaraṇa** is both **Sarvaghati** and **Deśaghāti**. Since the remaining six **Prakṛtis** are **Sarvaghati**, their **Dṛśya** is also **Sarvaghati**.

In the **Antarāya-prāpta** substance, the **Avali** should be divided into innumerable parts (**Pratibhāga**) and one part should be kept separate. The remaining **Bahubhāga** should be divided into five equal parts and one part each should be given to the five **Prakṛtis**. Now, in the remaining one part, the **Pratibhāga** should be divided and the **Bahubhāga** should be given to **Bīryāntarāya**. In the remaining one part, the **Pratibhāga** should be divided again and the **Bahubhāga** should be given to **Upbhogāntarāya**. Similarly, in the remaining one part, the **Pratibhāga** should be divided and the **Bahubhāga** should be given to **Bhogāntarāya** and **Lābharatarāya** respectively. The remaining one part should be given to **Dānāntarāya**. By adding their respective **Bahubhāga** to their respective equal parts, the substance of each is obtained.

The **Mohaniya-Sarvaghati** substance should be divided into innumerable parts of the **Pratibhāga** **Avali** and one part should be kept separate. The remaining **Bahubhāga** should be divided into seventeen equal parts and given to the seventeen **Prakṛtis**. In the remaining one part, the **Pratibhāga** should be divided and the **Bahubhāga** should be given to **Mithyātva**. In the remaining one part, the **Pratibhāga** should be divided and the **Bahubhāga** should be given to **Anantānubandhi Lobha**. The remaining one part should be divided into the **Pratibhāga**...

## The Fifth Karma Granth

One should give the **bahubhag** (majority portion) to **anantaanubandhi** (infinitely connected) **maya** (delusion). Similarly, whatever portion remains, one should give the **pratibhag** (counterpart portion) to the **bahubhag** (majority portion) of **anantaanubandhi** (infinitely connected) **shodh** (search), **anantaanubandhi** (infinitely connected) **maan** (pride), **sanjwalan** (agitated) **lobh** (greed), **sanjwalan** (agitated) **maya** (delusion), **sanjwalan** (agitated) **krodh** (anger), **sanjwalan** (agitated) **maan** (pride), **pratyakhyanaavaran** (denial-covering) **lobh** (greed), **pratyakhyanaavaran** (denial-covering) **maya** (delusion), **pratyakhyanaavaran** (denial-covering) **krodh** (anger), **pratyakhyanaavaran** (denial-covering) **maan** (pride), **apratyakhyanaavaran** (non-denial-covering) **lobh** (greed), **apratyakhyanaavaran** (non-denial-covering) **maya** (delusion), **apratyakhyanaavaran** (non-denial-covering) **krodh** (anger), and **apratyakhyanaavaran** (non-denial-covering) **maan** (pride). The remaining one portion should be given to **apratyakhyanaavaran** (non-denial-covering) **maan** (pride). By combining the **bahubhag** (majority portion) of each with its own one portion, one obtains one's own **sarvaghati** (all-destroying) **dravya** (substance).

One should give the **deshghati** (country-destroying) **dravya** (substance) to the **asanikhyat** (innumerable) portions of **avali** (series), keeping one portion separate. Then, one should give half of the **bahubhag** (majority portion) to **nokashay** (non-virtuous passions) and the other half of the **bahubhag** (majority portion) and the remaining one portion to **sanjwalan** (agitated) **kashay** (passions). One should give the **pratibhag** (counterpart portion) to the **deshghati** (country-destroying) **dravya** (substance) of **sanjwalan** (agitated) **kashay** (passions), keeping one portion separate. Then, one should divide the remaining **bahubhag** (majority portion) into four equal parts and give one part each to the four **kashay** (passions) - **krodh** (anger), etc. One should give the **pratibhag** (counterpart portion) to the one portion to **sanjwalan** (agitated) **lobh** (greed). One should give the **pratibhag** (counterpart portion) to the remaining one portion to the **bahubhag** (majority portion) of **sanjwalan** (agitated) **maya** (delusion). One should give the **pratibhag** (counterpart portion) to the remaining one portion to the **bahubhag** (majority portion) of **sanjwalan** (agitated) **krodh** (anger). And one should give the remaining one portion to **sanjwalan** (agitated) **maan** (pride). By combining the **bahubhag** (majority portion) of each with its own one portion, one obtains one's own **deshghati** (country-destroying) **dravya** (substance). By combining the **sarvaghati** (all-destroying) and **deshghati** (country-destroying) **dravya** (substance) of the four **sanjwalan** (agitated) **kashay** (passions), one obtains one's own **sarvadravya** (all-substance).

The **dravya** (substance) of **mithyatva** (false belief) and the twelve **kashay** (passions) is all **sarvaghati** (all-destroying), and the **dravya** (substance) of **nokashay** (non-virtuous passions) is all **deshghati** (country-destroying). The division of **nokashay** (non-virtuous passions) is as follows: One should give the **pratibhag** (counterpart portion) to the **dravya** (substance) of **nokashay** (non-virtuous passions), keeping one portion separate. Then, one should divide the **bahubhag** (majority portion) into five equal parts and give one part each to the five **prakriti** (elements). One should give the **pratibhag** (counterpart portion) to the remaining one portion to the **bahubhag** (majority portion) of the **veda** (scripture) to which the **bandh** (bond) is attached. One should give the **pratibhag** (counterpart portion) to the remaining one portion to the **bahubhag** (majority portion) of **rati** (attraction) or **arati** (repulsion) to which the **bandh** (bond) is attached. The remaining one...

##  Appendix-2:

**1432**

The portion of the participant should be divided into the portion of the multi-portion and given to whichever of the two, **Hasy** (laughter) and **Shok** (grief), is bound. The remaining one portion should be divided into the portion of the participant and the multi-portion should be given to **Bhay** (fear). The remaining one portion should be given to **Jugupsa** (disgust). By adding the remaining multi-portion to their respective one portion, their respective **Drsya** (visual) is obtained.

**Namakam-Tiyangati**, **Ekendiryajati**, **Audarik**, **Tanjas**, **Kamga** (three **Gari**), **Humb** (pride), **Samman** (respect), **Varnchatushk**, **Tiryachanupurvi**, **Agurulghu**, **Upadhat**, **Mpavar**, **Sukshma**, **Aparayapt**, **Sadharan**, **Asthir**, **Ashubh**, **Dubhang**, **Anadeya**, **Ayashkoti** (terrible **Nirman**), these twenty-three **Prakritis** (natures) are bound together, a human being performs **Apva** (false) **Tithi** (ceremony) and **Mithyaishti** (false worship).

In the **Dramp** (substance) that **Namakarma** (name karma) receives, one portion should be kept separate by dividing the portion of the **Avali** (infinite) into its countless parts, and the multi-portion should be divided into twenty-one equal portions, giving one portion to each **Prakriti**. Because **Up!** (above) **Pee** (below) **Prakritis**, **Naukar** (servant) **Va** (or) **Ko** (who), all three **Prakritis** are just sub-divisions of the **Marir** (mortal) **Nama** (name) **Pind** (body) **Prakriti**. Therefore, they do not receive separate **Davy** (substance), but only one **Sharir** (body) **Namakarma** receives a share. Therefore, only this **Iskrim** (ice cream) is divided into portions.

The remaining one multi-portion should be divided into the countless parts of the **Avali** and given to the multi-portion from the end to the beginning in order. For example, in one portion, the portion of the **Avali** should be given to the multi-portion of the **Nirman** **Prakriti** at the end. In the remaining portion, the portion of the **Avali** should be given to the multi-portion of **Ayash** **Kirti** (bad fame). In the remaining one portion, again the portion of the **Avali** should be given to the multi-portion of **Janadeya** (worthy of being known). In the same way, in each remaining one portion, the portion of the participant should be given to the multi-portion of **Durbhang**, **Ashubh** etc. in decreasing order. The remaining one portion at the end should be given to **Tiyangati**.

By adding the remaining portion to their respective equal portions, their respective **Davy** (substance) is obtained. Where twenty-five, twenty-six, twenty-seven, twenty-nine, thirty, thirty-one **Prakritis** are bound together, the order of distribution should be known in the same way. But where only one **Mashikirti** is bound, all the **Davy** (substance) of **Namakarma** is received by this one **Prakriti** alone. 

Page #468:
---------------------------
## The Fifth Karma Text

In the bond-places of **Name Karma**, which are **Pind Prakritis**, the substance of these **Pind Prakritis** is distributed among their **Avantaar Prakritis**. For example, in the upper bond-places, there are three divisions of the **Pind Prakriti** called **Body**. Therefore, in the distribution, the **Avy** that is received by the **Pariir Name Kram** should be divided into three equal parts, giving one part to each of the three. The remaining one part should be divided into two parts, giving the larger part to the **Karman Body** and the smaller part to **Tajas**. The remaining one part should be given to **Audarik**. The same understanding should be applied to other **Pind Prakritis**. Where only one **Avantaar Prakriti** is bound among the **Avantaar Prakritis** of a **Pind Prakriti**, the entire substance of the **Pind Prakriti** should be given to that one **Prakriti**.

The reason for giving progressively more and more substance to the **Antaram** and **Name Karma** in their distribution has already been explained in the beginning. It was stated that the **Avantaar Prakritis** of **Janaavaran**, **Darshaavaran**, and **Mohaniya** are progressively given less and less substance, while the **Antaram** and **Name Karma** Prakritis are progressively given more and more substance.

**Vedaniya**, **Gayu**, and **Gotra Karma** bind only one **Avantaar Prakriti** at a time. Therefore, the substance received by the **Mula Prakriti** is given to that one **Prakriti** only. There is no distribution in this case.

Thus, according to **Go Karma**, the distribution of **Pudgal** substance among the **Karma Prakritis** should be understood. Now, we will discuss the hierarchy of **Karma Liks** in the **Avantaar Prakritis** as described in **Pradesh Bandh (Ga 28)**. This will help us understand the order of distribution among the **Avantaar Prakritis**, which **Prakriti** receives the most, and which **Prakriti** receives the least.

First, we will consider the **Avantaar Prakritis** in terms of their **Alpa Bahutva** (lesser abundance) compared to the **Utkrishta Pad** (superior state):

1. **Shamaavaran**: The least.
2. **Kevalgyanaavaran**: Infinitely more than **Shamaavaran**.
3. **Manparyaaya Gyanaavaran**: Infinitely more than **Kevalgyanaavaran**.
4. **Avadhimanaavaran**: Infinitely more than **Manparyaaya Gyanaavaran**. 

Page #469:
---------------------------
##  Appendix-2

**Varna** has the least part, **Shruta-Shaanavaran** has more than that, and **Mati-Jnanaavaran** has more than that.

**Darshanaavaran** - 1. **Prachala** has the least part, 2. **Nidra** has more than that, 3. **Pravala-Pratala** has more than that, 4. **Nidra-Nidra** has more than that, 5. **Styan-Dhi** has more than that, 6. **Keval-Darshanaavaran** has more than that, 7. **Avadhi-Jnanaavaran** has infinitely more than that, 8. **Achakshu-Darshanaavaran** has more than that, and 9. **Chakshu-Darshanaavaran** has more than that.

**Devniya-Asata Vedaniya** has the least part, and **Sata Vedaniya** has more than that.

**Mohaniya** - 1. **A-Pratyakhyanaavaran** **Man** has the least part, 2. **A-Pratyakhyanaavaran** **Krodh** has more than that, 3. **A-Pratyakhyanaavaran** **Maya** has more than that, and 4. **A-Pratyakhyanaavaran** **Lobh** has more than that. In this way... **Pratyakhyanaavaran** **Chatushk** (Man, Krodh, Maya, and Lobh in order) has progressively more parts. From that, 9-12. **Ananta-Anubandhi Chatushk** has progressively more parts. From that, 13. **Mithyatva** has more parts. From **Mithyatva**, 14. **Jugupsa** has infinitely more parts, from that, 15. **Bhay** has more parts, 16, 17. **Hasp** and **Shok** have more parts than that but are equal to each other, 18, 19. **Rati** and **Arati** have more parts than that but are equal to each other, 20, 21. **Stri** and **Napunsakaved** have more parts than that but are equal to each other, 22. **Sanjwalan Krodh** has more parts than that, 23. **Sanjwalan Man** has more parts than that, 24. **Purushved** has more parts than that, 25. **Sanjwalan Maya** has more parts than that, and 26. **Sanjwalan Lobh** has an innumerable number of times more parts.

**Ayukarma** - All four **Prakritis** have equal parts, because they bind together.

**Maamakarma** - In **Pati Namakarma**, **Devgati** and **Narakgati** have the least parts but are equal to each other, **Manushygati** has more than that, and **Tiyachgati** has more than that.

**Jati Namakarma** - **Dwi-Indriya** etc. four **Jatis** have the least parts but are equal to each other, and **Ekeindriya Jati** has more parts than that.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

**In the body called "Sharira"**: The Aharak Sharira has the least portion, followed by the Audarik Sharira, which has a larger portion than the Aharak Sharira. The Karman Sharira has a larger portion than the Audarik Sharira, and the Tejas Sharira has a larger portion than the Karman Sharira.

Appendix-2

There is more of it. In all four pairs, the two-two touches have equal parts.
In Ānṛpūrva - Devānṛpūrva and Narakānṛpūrva have the least part, but they are equal to each other. From that, Manuṣyānṛpūrva and Tiryacānṛpūrva have more and more parts respectively.
In Vihāyogati - Praṇast Vihāyogati has less and Aprāśast Vihāyogati has more than that. _Asāvi Bīs in:- Pras has less, Śāvar has more than that! Paryāpt has less, Aparyāpt has more than that. In the same way, one should understand each-ordinary, stable-unstable, auspicious-inauspicious, easy-difficult, Mujham-Dādar and Ādeya-Anādeya as well. And Ayas:Kīrti has the least part and Yas:Kīrti has more than that. Ātap Udyot, Praśast Aprāśast Vihāyogati, Musvar, Duḥsvar have equal parts among themselves.
Nirmāṇa, Ichaśvās, Parādhāt, Upadhāt, Anurulghu and Tīrṣkar Nāma do not have Alpबहुत्व. Because the idea of Alpबहुत्व is considered only in homogeneous or opposite natures. For example, Varṇanāmakarma is homogeneous for Kṛṣṇa Nāmakarma and Subhag and Dur Bhag are opposite to each other. But the above natures are neither homogeneous because they are not sub-natures of any one Piḍa nature, nor are they opposite because their bondage can also happen together.
Gotrakarma - Nīc Gotra has less and Ucca Gotra has more.
Antarāyakarma - Dānantarāya has the least and Lābha, Bhoga, Upbhoga and Vīrya Antarāya have more and more parts respectively.
One should understand the above Alpबहुत्व in relation to the excellent position and in relation to the inferior position -
Janavarpa and Vednīc have Alpबहुत्व as before. In Darśanābaraṇa, Nidrā has the least, Prachalā has more than that, Nidā. Nidā

**Pancham Karma Granth**

The **Prachala-Prachala** is greater than **Usse**. **Styanaddhi** is greater than **Prachala-Prachala**. The rest is the same as before.

The only difference in **Mohaniya** is that the three Vedas are mutually nullified and are **Rati-Ati** special. **Sanjwalan** is greater than **Man**, **Krodha**, **Maya**, and **Lomas** in increasing order.

In **Ayu**, **Tiryanchayu** and **Manushyau** are the least, and **Devau**, **Narakau** are countless times greater.

In **Namakarma**, **Liyanchati** is the least, **Manushya Gati** is greater, **Devagati** is countless times greater, and **Narakagati** is countless times greater. **Jati** is the same as before.

In **Sharir**, **Audarik** is the least, **Tejas** is greater, **Karman** is greater, **Vakriya** is countless times greater, and **Aharak** is countless times greater. The same order should be known for **Saghaas** and **Bandhan**. In **Shango**, **Audarik** is the least, **Vakriya** is countless times greater, and **Paharak** is countless times greater. **Anupurvi** is the same as before. The rest of the **Prakritis** should also be known as before.

**Gotra** and **Antaraya** are the same as before. That is, **Neecha Gotra** is less and **Umman Gotra** is greater. **Danaant Ray** is less, **Labhant Ray** is greater, **Bhogant Ray** is greater, **Upbhogant Ray** is greater, and **Viryaant Ray** is greater.

In this way, according to the **Karmakand** and **Karma Prakriti**, one should understand the division and the lesser and greater aspects of the **Karma Prakritis** and **Karma Dalikas**.

Appendix-3
Statement of the Anuyogadwar Sutra etc. regarding the hairs to be used to fill the Palya
To demonstrate the proof of the Palya-upam, a Palya-gaha one yojana long, one yojana wide and one yojana deep has been ordained to be filled with hairs from one to a year. The different perspectives in this regard are clarified here.
The Anuyogadwar Sutra states in the verse "Egahibim, Dehinateyahim Jav Ukkoesenam Sas Rattarakan" Walaggodiin" and the Pravachansaro-uddar also has a similar text. The commentary of both explains that the hairs that fall out on the first day after shaving the head are called Ekahiky, the hairs that fall out on the second day are called Vahilay, the hairs that fall out on the third day are called Nyahithy, and so on, the hairs that grow out in seven days should be taken.
The Nacha-lokaprakash states that the hairs that grow out from one to seven days after shaving the head of the people of Uttara Kuru should be taken. It further states that
"Kshetrasama-Vridhavasi-Jambudwip-Prajnapti-tyabhi-prayo'yam. Pravachansaro-uddar-vatti-sangrahan-ivriha-krityo-stu Mundite Girasi Efena-sa Dvabhyam-aho-bhyam Yavad-utkarshatah Saptabhir-aho-bhih Prakalan-i Walagra-ni Ityadi Samanyalah Kathana-dut-tarakuna-ra-walagra-ni Nokna Niti Jneyam.

## The Fifth Karma Granth
436

This means that the **Vṛhadvṛtti** of **Kṣetrasamāsa** and the **Vṛddhi** of **Jambudvīpaprajñapti** state that the hair of the people of **Uttarakuru** should be taken. However, the **Vṛtti** of **Pravacanasāroddhāra** and the **Vṛhadvṛtti** of **Sangrahaṇī** mention hair that has grown for one to seven days after a general shave. They do not mention the hair of the people of **Uttarakuru**. The **Svopājñavṛtti** of **Kṣetravicāra** states that the hair of a seven-day-old **meṣa** (sheep) born in **Devakuru** and **Uttarakuru**, measuring **utsedhāṅgula** (the length of a raised finger), should be taken and divided into eight parts seven times. This means that the hair should be divided into eight parts, and then each of those parts should be divided into eight parts again. By doing this, the hair will be divided into 2,067,152 parts. This number of parts should be used to fill the **palsa**.

The **Jambudvīpaprajñapti** also has the verse "**eyahi cehi tehi'a ukkosenaṁ satta rattaparūṭhāṇaṁ vālagga kodīja'**". The commentator has interpreted this as "**vāleṣu prāṇi śreṣṭhāṇi vālagrāṇi kurutar romāṇi teṣāṁ koṭayaḥ anekaḥ koṭi pramukhāḥ saṁkhyāḥ**", which means "among hairs, the best hairs are the hairs of the **kuru** land (**Devakuru**, **Uttarakuru**), and their number is in crores and crores". Thus, the commentator has taken the hair of the people of the **kuru** land (**Devakuru**, **Uttarakuru**) as the general hair.

**Digambara** literature mentions "**ekādisaptāhoraatrajātavīvālagrāṇi**", taking only the hair tips of a **meṣa** (sheep) born one to seven days old. The description of **palyopam** in **Digambara** literature

The **palyopam** and **sāgaropam** are used in the literature of both **Śvetāmbara** and **Digambara** sects to calculate time using the **upamā** (analogy) method. However, their descriptions differ. The nature and other aspects of **palyopam** found in **Śvetāmbara** literature have been described in verse 65. However, the description of **palyopam** found in **Digambara** literature is different from the aforementioned description. There is no distinction called **kṣetrapalyopam** in it.

...

Page #475:
---------------------------
## Appendix-3

Not every Palyopama, its divisions and subtle differences have been explained. In brief, the description of Palyopama is as follows:

There are three types of Palya: Vyavahar Palya, Uddhar Palya and Adha Palya. All three names are meaningful. The first Palya is called Vyavahar Palya because it is the basis of the behavior of Uddhar and Adha Palya. In other words, the only use of Vyavahar Palya is that it forms the basis of Uddhar Palya and Adha Palya. Nothing is measured by it. 

Naramya is known by the number of sixteen, therefore it is called Uddhar Palya. And Adha Palya is known by the lifespan of beings, therefore it is called Adha Palya.

The proof of these three Palya is as follows:

Create three pits, each one Yojana long, one Yojana wide and one Yojana deep, using a Pramanangula. From one day to seven days, cut the front parts of the hairs of a sheep and make them so small that they cannot be cut by a comb. The first Palya should be filled tightly with these hair fragments. This Palya is called Vyavahar Palya.

From that Vyavahar Palya, one hair fragment should be removed every hundred years. The time it takes for this Palya to become empty is called Vyavahar Palyopama. 

By imagining one hair fragment of Vyavahar Palya, create as many fragments as there are years in an innumerable koti (a very large number). Fill the second Palya with all these hair fragments. This is called Uddhar Palya.

From that Uddhar Palya, one fragment should be removed every moment. The time it takes for this Palya to become empty is called Uddhar Palyopama Kala. Ten Koti Koti Uddhar Palyopama makes one Uddhar Sagaropama. There should be as many islands and oceans as there are hair fragments in one Uddhar Sagaropama.

From the hair fragments of Uddhar Palya, imagine as many hair fragments as there are years in a hundred years, and fill the third Palya with them. This is called Adha Palya. From this, one hair fragment should be removed every moment.

The time taken for a *palya* to become empty while removing its parts is called *addha-palyopama*. Ten *koṭakoṭi* *addha-palya* make one *addha-sagar*.

One *utsarpini* and one *avsarpiṇī* exist for each *addha-sagar*. The *addha-palyopama* helps understand the *karma-sthiti*, *bhavaspiti*, and *kaya-sthiti* of *naraka*, *tiyanch*, *manushya*, and *deva*.

## Description of *Pudgal* *Paravati* in Digambar Granths

Digambar literature describes five types of *pudgal* *paravarta*, known as *panch* *parivartan*. These are: *dravya-parivartan*, *kshetra-parivartan*, *kal-parivartan*, *man-parivartan*, and *bhad-parivartan*.

* **Dravya-parivartan** has two types: *nokarma-dravya-parivartan* and *karma-dravya-parivartan*. Their nature is as follows:

* **Nokarma-dravya-parivartan**: A being takes in *pudgal* suitable for three bodies and six *paryapti* at one time and discards them at another time. After that, it takes in *pudgal* that were not previously taken, then takes in mixed *pudgal*, and finally takes in *pudgal* that were previously taken. When the same *pudgal* that were taken in at one time are taken in again by the same being in the form of *nokarma*, with the same qualities, shape, taste, smell, and touch, the duration of that time is called *nokarma-dravya-parivartan*.

* **Karma-dravya-parivartan**: Similarly, a being takes in some *pudgal* suitable for eight types of *karma* at one time and discards them after a certain time. When the same *pudgal* are taken in again by the same being in the same way, the duration of that time is called *karma-dravya-parivartan*.

* **Dravya-parivartan** or *pudgal-parivartan* is the combination of *nokarma-dravya-parivartan* and *karma-dravya-parivartan*. Either one of them is called *ardha-pudgal-parivartan*.

* **Parivartan** is the holder of the most subtle *avagahana*, the *nigodīya* *piya*. 

Page #477:

## English Translation:

**Appendix-3**

A being was born and died, having made the eight Madhya Pradesh of the Sof its own Madhya Pradesh of the body. The same being was born and died again, carrying the same Avagahana. In this way, it was born and died countless times in the same Avagahana, as many times as there are Pradesh in the countless parts of the Ghanangul. After that, it made the entire Lokakasha its birthplace, increasing one Pradesh at a time, and thus completed a Kal-Parivartan.

**Kal-Parivartan:** A being was born in the first time of the Utsarpini Kal and died after completing its lifespan. The same being was born in the second time of the Utsarpini and died after completing its lifespan. The same being was born in the third time of the Nisari Utsarpini and died in the same way. In this way, it was born in all the times of the Utsarpini Kal and similarly in all the times of the Avasarpini Kal. It completed the cycle of death as it did with birth. That is, it died in the first time of the first Utsarpini, died in the second time of the second Utsarpini, and similarly died in the first time of the first Avasarpini, died in the second time of the second Avasarpini. The time taken to experience all the times of the Utsarpini and Avasarpini Kal through its birth and death is called Kal-Parivartan.

**Bhav-Parivartan:** The most severe lifespan in Narakgati is ten thousand years. A being was born in Narak with that lifespan. After dying, it was born again in Narak with the same lifespan, having emerged from Narak. In this way, it was born in Narak countless times with the same lifespan, as many times as there are ten thousand years. After that, it was born in Narak with a lifespan of ten thousand years plus one. In this way, it was born in Narak with increasing lifespans, one at a time, until it reached the highest lifespan of Narakgati, which is thirty-three Magar Purna. After that, it took on the Tiyachgati. It was born and died in Tiyachgati with a lifespan of Antarmuhurta. After that, it was born again in Tiyachgati with the same lifespan. In this way, it was born countless times with a lifespan of Antarmuhurta, as many times as there are moments in Antarmuhurta. After that, it was born in Sirshachgati, increasing one time at a time, as described earlier.

## The Fifth Chapter: The Five Aggregates

**443**

One who has completed the three stages of existence (**tirthankara**, **manushya**, and **deva**) has completed the time of the **tirthankara** existence, just as one completes the time of the **manushya** existence, and the time of the **deva** existence just as one completes the time of the **naraka** existence. However, one must understand that there is a difference in the **deva** existence. In the **deva** existence, the **bhavachakram** is completed only after completing the lifespan of 31 **sagaras**. Devas who have a lifespan of more than 31 **sagaras** are called **sampatti** devas, and they attain **moksha** after experiencing one or two **manushya** births. Thus, the time taken to experience all four existences is called **bhavachakram**.

**Bhavachakram** - Due to the **sthitibandha** of **karma**, there are countless **loka** (worlds) and countless **kṣaya** (destruction) **adhyavasaya** (determination) **sthāna** (places). Due to each **kṣaya** **sthāna**, there are countless **loka** and countless **anubhāga** (part) **adhyavasaya** **sthāna**.

A **panchendriya** (five-sense) **saṁjñī** (conscious) **paryāpsaka** (one who has attained **paryāpta** knowledge) **mithyātvī** (one who holds false beliefs) **jīva** (soul) has performed **jñānāvaraṇa** **karma** and has a **sthitibandha** of **antaḥkoṭakoṭi** **sagara** (innumerable **sagara**s). At that time, he has the most **jghanya** (inferior) **kṣaya** **sthāna**, the most **jghanya** **anubhāga** **sthāna**, and the most **jghanya** **yoga** **sthāna**. At another time, the same **sthitibandha**, the same **kṣaya** **sthāna**, and the same **anubhāga** **sthāna** remain, but the **yoga** **sthāna** becomes the second most **jghanya**. In this way, with the same **sthitibandha**, **kṣaya** **sthāna**, and **anubhāga** **sthāna**, he completes all the **yoga** **sthāna**s in countless parts of the **śreṇī** (series). After the completion of the **yoga** **sthāna**s, the **sthitibandha** and **kṣaya** **sthāna** remain the same, but the **anubhāga** **sthāna** changes. He then completes all the **yoga** **sthāna**s for that **anubhāga** **sthāna** as well. In this way, after the completion of all the **anubhāga** **adhyavasaya** **sthāna**s, he has a different **kṣaya** **sthāna** with the same **sthitibandha**. He then completes the **anubhāga** **sthāna**s and **yoga** **sthāna**s for that **kṣaya** **sthāna** as well. Again, he has a third **kṣaya** **sthāna**, and he completes the **anubhāga** **sthāna**s and **yoga** **sthāna**s for that **kṣaya** **sthāna** as well. In this way, after the completion of all the **kṣaya** **sthāna**s, the **jīva** has a **sthitibandha** of more **antaḥkoṭakoṭi** **sagara**s. He then completes the **kṣaya** **sthāna**s, **anubhāga** **sthāna**s, and **yoga** **sthāna**s for that **sthitibandha** as well. In this way, he completes the **utkṛṣṭa** (superior) **sthiti** (state) of **jñānāvaraṇa** **karma** of **tīsa** **koṭakoṭi** **sagara**s (thirty **koṭakoṭi** **sagara**s) by increasing it one by one. In the same way, when the **jīva** completes the **sthiti** (state) of all the **mūla** (root) **prakṛti** (nature) and **uttara** (later) **prakṛti** (nature), then he has completed the **bhavachakram**.

In all these changes, one must pay attention to the order. That is, not in a disorderly manner...

## Appendix-3

The action, which is the subtle particle transformation, is not considered in the calculation. The arrangement should be understood here as it is. This is a description of the owners of the excellent and inferior regions, as found in the Gommatasara Karmakanda.

The Digambara literature also describes the owners of the region-bonds in the Karmakanda. This is generally similar to the description of the Karmagranthi. The relevant portion is presented here for use in comparative study.

This is the general rule regarding the owners of the excellent and inferior region-bonds: A being with sufficient restraint and who accumulates a lot of merit, including excellent people, makes an excellent region-bond. A being who is unconscious, has many natures, and makes an inferior region-bond, makes an inferior region-bond.

First, the ownership of the excellent bond of the primary natures is stated in the Gunasthanas:

**211.  "The excellent region-bond of the Ayukarma is made by the one who resides in the seventh Gunasthana after the six Gunasthanas. The excellent region-bond of the Mohaniya is made by the one who resides in the ninth Gunasthana. And the excellent region-bond of the remaining six, except for the Aama and Mohaniya, is made by the being who resides in the tenth Gunasthana, the Sukhsamparaya, who is the holder of the excellent Yoga."**

Here, it should be understood that all the bonds are made by the excellent Yoga.

The ownership of the excellent region-bond of the secondary natures is as follows:

**212. "The excellent region-bond of the Sarva, Suhma, and Saraga is made by the one who resides in the fifth Patti of the Vesa. The excellent region-bond of the Ayaya and Vivitprakasaya is made by the one who resides in the Uktasadva. **

**213. "The excellent region-bond of the Chhannokasaya, Niddapaya, and Lalita is made by the one who resides in the Sammago. The excellent region-bond of the Sammo, Vamo, Tera, Parasura, and Aau is made by the one who resides in the Bhasava. **

**214. "The excellent region-bond of the Devacara, Makara, Samara, Sthama, and Manasu is made by the one who resides in the Sugati. The excellent region-bond of the Aahara, Appama, Sesapasu, and Bako is made by the one who resides in the Mindo."**

The five *karma* of *matijnanaavaran* etc., the four of *darshanavaran*, the five of *antaraya*, the *pasha*, *kiti*, *vachan* *gotra* and the seven *vedanodh*, these eight types of *prakriti* have their *utkrusht* *pradeshabandha* in the tenth *sukshmas* *param* *gunasthan*. The five of *purushatred* etc. in the ninth *anivrittivadar* *gunasthan*, the four of *hosra* *pratyakhyanavaran* *kashay* in the fifth *gunasthan* called *des* *virati*, and the four of *pama* *tushma* in the fourth *avirata* *gunasthan* have their *utkrusht* *pradeshabandha*. The six *nokashay*, *nida*, *prachala* and *tirthankara*, these nine *prakriti* have their *utkrusht* *pradeshabandha* done by the *samyashti* *jiva*, and the *manushyar*, *devayu*, *asata* *vedaniya*, *devati* etc. *devatashtka*, *vajragamanaraach* *sanhanan*, *samchaturas* *sansthan*, *prashast* *vihamanagati*, *subhashik*, these thirteen *prakriti* have their *utkrusht* *pradeshabandha* done by both *samyagdristi* and *michyaishti*. The *aaharakathik* has its *utkrusht* *pradeshabandha* done by the *aprammat* *gunasthan*. Except for these *jiva* *prakriti*, the remaining sixty-six *prakriti* have their *utkrusht* *pradeshabandha* done by the *midhyadristi* *jiva* through *utkrusht* *yoga*.

After mentioning the owners of *utkrusht* *pradeshabandha*, now we will tell about the owners of *jghanya* *pradeshabandha*. Regarding the *bandhak* of the *mul* *prakriti*, it is said:

**215**

*Sahamaniodapajjattayassa pahame jahaṇṇaye jōge.
Sattamhaṁ tu jahaṇṁ āugavardhesi āuss.*

Except for *ashu*, the seven *mul* *prakriti* have their *jghanya* *pradeshabandha* through *jananya* *yoga* in the first time of the *nigodaya* *labhyaparyapta* *jiva* in its *paryaya*. When the *ayu* of that *jiva* is *van* (destroyed), then the *jghanya* *pradeshabandha* of its *ayu* also happens. The *ayukarma* is not destroyed completely, therefore it is said that the *ayukarma* is *alamb* (destroyed partially). That means the *jghanya* *pradeshabandha* of the *pathi* *karma* is done by the *sukshmanigodaya* *labhyaparyapta* *jiva*.

After mentioning the *jghanya* *pradeshabandha* of the *mul* *prakriti*, we will tell about the *uttar* *prakriti*:

**216**

*Ghoḍaṇajōgōsaṇṇī pirayyusuraṇirayāujah.
Apamatto yāhāram śrayayō tiramṁ ca ṣaṣak.*

The **Sukshma Nigodaya** being, which holds the last **Bhav** out of the 6012 **Bhav** of the **Labdhyaparyaptak** and is situated in the first turn out of the three turns of **Vigrahgati**, binds the remaining 106 natures.
Both the **Karmagranth** and **Go. Karmakand** consider the **Sukshma Nigodaya** **Labdhyaparyaptak** being as the **Jghanya Pradeshbandhak** of 106 natures. The **Karmagranth** states that it is the binder in the first time of birth, but the **Go. Karmakand** states that it is the binder of the last **Bhav** out of the 6012 **Bhav** of the **Labdhyaparyaptak**.
**Explanation of the structure of Gunashrabhi**
The structure of **Kamandalikas** from **Rikshan** to **Pratismmay Asankhyataguine Asankhyataguine** is called **Gunashreni**. The nature of this **Gunashreni** is explained clearly in the commentary of **Karmaprakriti Ga. 15** by **Upadhyay Yashovijayji** as follows:
**Adhuna Gunashva Niswaroopamaah Yatsthiti Kandakam Ghatayati Tanmadhyaddalikam Nrihitva Udayasamayadarabhyantmuhurt Charamasamayam**

## The Fifth Karma Granth
### 347

The method of depositing the collected dalikas must be observed. Moreover, for the creation of the guna-shreni, the dalika that is being collected should be seen as having an infinite number of gunas, increasing with each subsequent time period. It is said:

**First Time Period**

"In the case of dalikas, the tiṣmaṇa-upāpati is established in the vyāma, and it is not multiplied by any guna. It is collected in the first time period, and in the second time period, it is multiplied by an infinite number of gunas. In this way, with each time period, it becomes infinitely large, until it reaches the end of the antarmūhūrta."

**Time of Deposition**

Here, the measure of the antarmūhūrta is from the cessation of the previous karma to the rising of the sun. The dalika is deposited in the remaining time periods after the vedana has subsided, but not in the time period of the rising of the sun.

The time period for the creation of the guna-shreni, which is the form of the dalika, should be considered slightly longer. During this time period, the guna-shreni increases. It is said:

**The Ladder of Time**

"Know that the time period is equal to the number of vrṣṇaya-karana. The dalika is deposited in the remaining time period after the rising of the sun."

**Meaning**

Now, what is the nature of the guna-shreni? It takes the dalikas from the previous state and deposits them in each time period from the time of the rising of the sun to the end of the antarmūhūrta, multiplying them by an infinite number of gunas in each time period. It is also said:

"Taking the dalikas from the previous state, it deposits a few in the first time period, an infinite number of times more in the second time period, and an infinite number of times more in the third time period. In this way, at the end of the antarmūhūrta time period, it deposits an infinite number of times more dalikas."

This is the method of depositing the dalikas that were collected in the first time period. In the same way, the method of depositing the dalikas that were collected in the second and subsequent time periods should be known. For the creation of the guna-shreni, the dalikas are deposited in increasing numbers, multiplied by an infinite number of gunas, from the first time period to the end of the guna-shreni. It is also said:

"Taking the dalikas from the previous state, it deposits a few in the first time period..."

Appendix-3
It takes an innumerable number of Dalikas at one time, and at another time it takes an innumerable number of times more Dalikas than that. In this way, it takes an innumerable number of times more Dalikas than an innumerable number of times until the end of the Antarmuhurta time.
The time for this deposition is Antarmuhurta, and the time for the creation of Dalikas, the form, and the quality series should be known to be slightly more than the time of the A-purvakarana and the time of the Anivrittikarana. Below this time, when the experience of the Udayakshana is destroyed, it creates Dalikas in the remaining moments, but the quality series does not fall to the other side. It is said:
"The time of the quality series should be known to be slightly more than the time of both the Karana. Its time is diminished by the Uday, so the remaining time is where the Dalikas are deposited."
The nature of the quality series is also explained in the Panchasangraha in the same way. The relevant verse is as follows:
"Padayathiyo Valiyam Ghettum Ghettum Asankhgunagaye.
Sahiyanukaran Kale Ukyai Rayaha Gugase Hi." (746, Labdhisar Digambar Granth)
According to the Labdhisar Digambar Granth, the nature of the quality series is explained as follows:
"Udamanasalihimhi Ya Ubhayanam Baharrammi Shivgarh.
Loyanam Asankhejjjo Kamaso Usakatuono Haro." (68)
The substance of the Jinas whose Uday is found is deposited in the Udayanali. For this, one should know the division of the innumerable Lokas. And the substance of those whose Uday and Anruday are both present is deposited in the external quality series or in the upper position from the Udayavali. For this, one should know the Apकर्षण division (the non-palpy part of the Palpy).
"Upakathin Igimaage Pallasa Lena Bhajide Tattha.
Bahubhaganivam Dava Uthavarillvidisu Nikkhaydi." (66)
When the Apकर्षण division is divided, in one part there are innumerable...

## Panchat Karma Granth 446

**A portion of the portion is given, of which the majority is deposited in the upper state.**

**The remaining portion, multiplied by an innumerable number, is the essence of the majority.**

**The remaining portion, given by the qualities, is the garment of the rising.**

**70. The remaining one portion is given to the false world, that is the demand of 35... The majority, which is on the left, should be given in the dimension of multiplication, and the remaining one portion should be given in the rising.**

**71. The portion of the measure at the time of the influx in the substance given in the rising, is the middle cube. And the portion of the half of the less than the measure of the influx of one less than the middle cube, is the measure of the age. By multiplying that age by the multiplier of the destruction (two qualities of destruction), the measure of the first insemination of the blissful one is obtained.**

**72. From that, in the subsequent inseminations, the measure should be known to decrease by one age in order. There, the measure of the substance given in the final insemination is obtained by decreasing the age by one less than the influx.**

**73. The substance given for the multiplication, which is reduced by the reduction, is one rod of the first time. From that, the second time is innumerable times greater, and in this way, the rod, which is innumerable times greater until the final time, is added. By dividing the sum of those rods, the measure obtained is multiplied by its own rods, and the substance given in the first niche of the dimension of the series of qualities is the measure of the innumerable times established.**

**From that, in the subsequent inseminations, the substance should be known to be innumerable times greater until the final time. The substance given in the first insemination is the measure of the innumerable parts of the substance given in the final insemination. The substance given in the subsequent inseminations is the decreasing age of the first destruction.**

Appendix-3
In the times from the second to the end of the गुणश्रेणी, the substance is continuously depleted by an infinite number of times, and it is deposited in the stages, i.e., in the previously mentioned types of उदयानि, etc. In this way, the गुणणि विधान of the seven forms of karma occurs in each time period!
The essence of this statement is that the गुणणि रचना occurs in both the natures that are arising and those that are not arising. The only difference is that the substance of the arising natures is deposited in all three: उदयावली, गुणश्रेणी, and the upper state, but the substance of the natures that are not arising is only deposited in the गुणणि and the upper state, not in the उदयावली. The meaning is that the substance given to the निषेक that are eligible to arise from the present time to the time of one आवली should be understood as the substance given in the उदयावली. The substance given to the निषेक that are equal to the times of the गुणश्रेणी above the उदयावली should be understood as the substance given in the गुणणि. The substance given to the remaining कर्मनिषेक, except for a few निषेक at the end above the गुणश्रेणी, should be understood as the substance given in the upper state. This can be understood by the example of मिथ्यात्व.
By dividing the substance of मिथ्यात्व by the अपकर्षक भागाहार, one part remains as it is, without the बहभाग प्रमाण substance, and the remaining one part is deposited in the upper state by dividing it by the infinite parts of the पल्य. One part is given in the गुणश्रेणी आयाम by dividing it by the infinite parts of the लोक, and the remaining one part is given in the उदयावली. In this way, for the गुणश्रेणी रचना, the substance is continuously depleted by an infinite number of times, up to the last time of the गुणाकाल, and it is deposited in the उदयावली, गुणणिआयाम, and the upper state, according to the previously mentioned विधान. In this way, one should know the गुणणि विधान of the remaining seven karmas, except for आयु.
In the गुणणि, the number of times is continuously decreasing in the successive times, with the number of times being infinite.

## The Fifth Karma Granth

Due to the increasing purity of the successive results, the exhaustion of karmas (nirjara) becomes increasingly numerous in the form of infinite multiplications of non-contact qualities (asanspataguna). In other words, as the morakarma (karma of attachment) is completely exhausted, the nirjara also increases, and the quantity of the substance (dravya) becomes infinitely multiplied, increasing further and further. As a result, the soul (jiva) gets closer and closer to liberation (moksha).

Those places where the substance of nirjara, multiplied by the factor of infinite multiplications, is found in increasing amounts are called guna-ni (quality-places), and the nirjara occurring in those places is called guna-uni nirjara.

The description of the guna-shreni (quality series) is mentioned in Go. Jivakanda, Gatha 66-67, keeping this view in mind. This description is similar to that found in Karma-prakriti, Panchasangrah, and Karmagranth. However, there is a difference in that the Karmagranth, etc., mentions eleven guna-ni places: Samyaktva (right faith), Deshaviriti (right conduct), Sarvaviriti (right knowledge), Anantanubandhi (infinitely connected), Darshanamoha (destruction of perception-delusion), Chariyamoha (subduing of conduct-delusion), Upashantamoha (subdued delusion), Lapka (grasping), Kshina-moha (diminished delusion), Sayogikevali (liberated with attachments), and Ayogikevali (liberated without attachments). However, in Go. Jivakanda, Tattvarthasutra, Sarvarthasiddhi, Tattvartharajavatika, etc., the two, Sayogikevali and Ayogikevali, are not considered separately, but are included under the term "Jin" (Jina).

The original verses of Go. Jivakanda mention ten places of the guna-shreni, but the commentator, while mentioning eleven places, clarifies that either Samyaktva-utpatti (arising of right faith) can be considered as one place, including the two aspects of Sa-tishaya-miccha-drishti (wrong faith with excess) and Asan-yat-samyaptti (right faith without restraint), thus completing eleven places, or, without doing so, the term Samyaktva-utpatti can be considered as one place, but the final term "Jin" should be considered as including two places: Svasthanasthita-kevali (liberated while remaining in their own place) and Samudayat-gata-kevali (liberated while moving in the assembly). The quantity of nirjara-dravya (substance of exhaustion) of Samudayat-gata-kevali is infinitely greater than that of Svasthanasthita-kevali.

Thus, there is a difference of opinion in accepting eleven or ten places of the guna-shreni.

## Appendix
### Explanation of the Provisions of Kshapakaṇi

The names of the natures that are subject to fear in the Shrapakaṇi are explained in accordance with the Karmagrantha in verses 121-123. The provisions of the Shrapakaṇi in the Gor Karmakāṇḍa are as follows:

**Nirya-tiriks-suragasate ṇ hi vesasayalabavakhavagā. Ayadacchatakkam tu aṇam aṇiyatṭīkaraṇacarimamhi.** || 335

**Jugavam saṁjogisa puṇovi aṇiyatṭīkaraṇabahumāgam. Poliya kamaso miccha missam samm khaveṣi phame.** || 366

**Meaning:** When there is the existence of Narakāyu, Tiriyachāyu, and Devāyu, there is no Deshavat, Mahāvrata, and Shrapakaṇi respectively. This means that Deshavat does not occur while Narakāyu exists, Mahāvrata does not occur while Tiriyachāyu exists, and Shrapakaṇi does not occur while Devāyu exists. Therefore, a person ascending the Shrapakaṇi does not have the existence of Narakāyu, Tiriyachāyu, and Devāyu. And an unrestrained person with a wrong perception, who is detached from the world, negligent and restrained, or non-negligent and restrained, performs the three karmas of Adhaḥkaraṇa, Apūrvakaraṇa, and Anivṛttikaraṇa as before. At the end of Anivṛttikaraṇa, he simultaneously detaches himself from the infinite attachments of anger, pride, deceit, and greed. These are transformed into the twelve Kṣayās, including A-pratyākhyānāvaraṇa, and the nine non-Kṣayās. After that, he rests for a moment and then performs Adhaḥkaraṇa, Apūrvakaraṇa, and Anivṛttikaraṇa again to destroy the Darshanamoha. During the time of Anivṛttikaraṇa, when one part of the time remains and the majority has passed, he destroys the natures of Mithyātva, Miśra, and Samyaktva in order, and thus becomes a person with a Kṣayika perception.

After this, he ascends the Shrapakaṇi to destroy the Charitramōha. First, he performs Adhaḥkaraṇa in the seventh Gunasthāna, and then, reaching the eighth Gunasthāna, he performs the same actions as before, such as Sthiti-khaṇḍana, Anubhāga-khaṇḍana, etc. Then, reaching the ninth Anivṛttikaraṇa Gunasthāna, he...

## The Fifth Karma Granth

The sixteen, eight, one, one, and six karmas are destroyed in the first five parts of the ninth Gunasthan, respectively. Or, they are severed from their existence. In the remaining four parts, one karma is severed from its existence in each part. Subsequently, in the tenth Gunasthan, the subtle Samprayaya Gunasthan, one karma is destroyed. In the eleventh Gunasthan, there is no destruction of any karma due to the lack of qualification. After that, in the twelfth Gunasthan, the Jina-moha Gunasthan, at the end, the existence of sixteen karmas is severed. In the Samogi Kevali Gunasthan, no karma is destroyed. In the fourteenth Gunasthan, the Ayogi Kevali Gunasthan, at the end, seventy-two karmas are destroyed in the first time period and thirteen karmas are destroyed in the second time period.

The explanation of the destruction of karmas should be understood as follows: In the first part of the ninth Gunasthan, thirteen karmas of the Nama karma, three karmas of the Darshanavarana karma (namely, Sthyanadhitrika, Kul, and Darshanavarana), and three karmas of the Ayogya karma (namely, Narakatik, Tiryanchatik, and Vikalatraik) are destroyed, totaling sixteen karmas. In the second part, four karmas of the Apratyakhyanavarana karma and four karmas of the Pratyakhyanavarana karma are destroyed, totaling eight karmas. In the third part, the Nupumsak Veda is destroyed. In the fourth part, the Stri Veda is destroyed. In the fifth part, the six karmas of Hasyaadi are destroyed. In the sixth, seventh, eighth, and ninth parts, the Purusha Veda, Sanjwalan Krodha, Mana, and Maya are destroyed, respectively. Thus, thirty-six karmas are destroyed in the ninth Gunasthan. In the tenth Gunasthan, the subtle Samprayaya Gunasthan, the Sanjwalan Lobha is destroyed. In the twelfth Gunasthan, the five karmas of the Gyanadharana, the four karmas of the Darshanavarana, the five karmas of the Ansaraya, and the two karmas of Nidra and Prachala are destroyed, totaling sixteen karmas. Then, after becoming a Sayogi Kevali, the fourteenth Gunasthan is attained. In the penultimate time period of the fourteenth Gunasthan, seventy-two karmas of the Nama, Gotra, and Vedaniya are destroyed. In the final time period, thirteen karmas are destroyed, and then liberation is attained. This is the attainment of the Kshataka Shreni.

In the final time period of the Ayogi Kevali Gunasthan, the opinions of some Acharyas...

Appendix-3

There is a difference of opinion regarding the number of  *prakritis* that are destroyed. Some believe that 13 *prakritis* are destroyed, while others believe that 12 *prakritis* are destroyed. Those who believe in the destruction of 13 *prakritis* explain their view as follows: At the time of death of a *tad-bhav* *moksha-gami*, thirteen *prakritis* including *anupurvi* remain in their *gatti* form, and except for the *tirthankara* *prakriti*, the remaining twelve *prakritis* remain in their *sat* form. The reason for this is that the thirteen *prakritis* that are obtained along with the *manushya-gati* are: *udaya*, *vipaki*, *manushya-ayu*, *kshetra-vipaki*, *manushya-anupurvi*, *jiva-dhipati*, the remaining nine *prakritis*, and one of the two *vedaniya* (either *sukha* or *duhkha*), *uttama-gotra*. These thirteen *prakritis* are obtained by the *samyav-moksha-gami* at the time of death and are not destroyed at the time of death. Therefore, at the time of death of a *tad-bhav* *moksha-gami*, thirteen *prakritis* remain in their *gatti* form and the other twelve *prakritis* remain in their *sat* form.

However, those who believe in the destruction of twelve *prakritis* at the time of death of a *kevali* in the fourteenth *gunasthan* argue that *manushya-anupurvi* is destroyed at the time of death because its function is to cause *udaya*. The *prakritis* that cause *udaya* do not have *sthiti-bhuta-samkrame* (the ability to remain in their *sthiti-bhuta* form), so at the time of death, they are found in their own form, which means that their *sat* is destroyed at the time of death. But all four *anupurvi* are *kshetra-vipaki*, so they arise only when the *mati* is made for another *bhav*. Therefore, they cannot arise in the *bhav* of the *jiva*, and since they cannot arise, *manushya-anupurvi* is destroyed at the time of death of the *ayogi* *kevali*.

In this difference of opinion, most believe that 72 *prakritis* are destroyed at the time of death of an *ayogi* *kevali* in the penultimate *gunasthan* and 13 *prakritis* are destroyed at the time of death. The commentary on the *panchama-karma-grantha* also states the same: 72 + 13. And in the *go-karma-kanda-gatha* 341, it is also written: " *udayagata-grahana-teral-charimhi-vochchhinna* ", meaning that the twelve *prakritis* that cause *udaya* and one *manushya-anupurvi*, a total of thirteen *prakritis*, are destroyed at the time of death of an *ayogi* *kevali*.

In short, this is the explanation of the *kshaya-shreni*.
