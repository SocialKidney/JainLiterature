## Statement

About six hundred years after the attainment of omniscience by Lord Vardhaman Veer Bhagwan, a severe famine struck the Magadh vihar. To escape the crisis, the great ascetic Nirmath Sadhu migrated to the south, where he was able to uphold his twenty-eight fundamental virtues flawlessly according to the teachings of Veer Vaani. Those who remained in Magadh could not withstand the terrible famine and became entangled in worldly affairs. They abandoned the teachings of Lord Mahavira, giving up Digambarism (wearing clothes) and making changes to the Vitarag Jinvaani under the influence of passions. They distorted the scriptures.

During this time, Acharya Kundkund Dev emerged. Through his knowledge and penance, he studied the original teachings of Lord Mahavira and spread Digambar Jainism from the south. He composed many texts in the Prakrit language, which was prevalent at that time, in accordance with the divine voice of Lord Mahavira.

To enable the devotees to achieve their welfare and become the Supreme Soul by embracing Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct, he primarily composed three texts: Samayapramrit, Panchastikaya Sangrah (Prabhrit), and Pravachansar. He also composed other supporting Prabhrit texts (like Moksha Pahud - Moksha Prabhrit).

To understand the principles described by the omniscient, passionless one, is Right Faith. If someone acquires knowledge of the Jinendra Vaani but does not have faith in it, then no action will bear fruit. This is why even those who recite the eleven Angas and nine Purvas remain trapped in the cycle of birth and death, while those who have even a little faith in the knowledge of the Tush-Masha (a tiny seed) are liberated from the world. Therefore, the attainment of Right Faith, which is the form of faith in the knowledge of the principles, is given the utmost importance.

It is also essential to know the principles taught by the omniscient Lord, because how can one have faith without knowing the principles? Having faith in the wrong things taught by ignorant and passionate individuals does not benefit the soul. In this Panchastikaya Prabhrit, Acharya Kundkund Dev has described in detail the seven principles, nine substances, six dravyas, five astikayas, and the time dravya, as taught by the omniscient, passionless Lord.

To make this text accessible to all and to ensure that the meaning of the Acharya's words is understood correctly, two Sanskrit commentaries and their Hindi translations have been included in this edition.

## The Commentary on the Panchaastikaya, by Shri Jayasenacharya

**Salutation:**

To the Supreme Soul, the Jina, who is self-realized,
To the pure soul, the eternal bliss, I bow. ||1||

**Introduction:**

This commentary on the Panchaastikaya, composed by Shri Kundakundaacharya, is presented in a clear and concise manner, following the established tradition of the disciples of Shri Kumaranandi Siddhanta Deva. 

The author, after attaining liberation and witnessing the divine form of the omniscient, non-attached, and liberated Tirthankara, Shri Mandar Swami, received the essence of the pure soul and other truths from the divine words emanating from his lotus mouth. He then returned to this world and composed this commentary, the Panchaastikaya Praabhrut, for the benefit of his disciples, like Shivakumar Maharaj, who were eager to understand the essence of the teachings. 

This commentary aims to explain the inner and outer aspects of the Panchaastikaya, as well as the primary and secondary meanings, in accordance with the Padmananyaaya.

**Structure of the Commentary:**

The Panchaastikaya Praabhrut is divided into three main sections (Mahaadhikars):

1. **First Mahaadhikars:** This section, comprising 111 verses, deals with the six substances (Dravyas) of the Panchaastikaya, starting with the verse "Indasayavdiyaanam". This section can also be considered to extend to 114 verses, as per the interpretation of the Amritachandra Tika.

2. **Second Mahaadhikars:** This section, comprising 50 verses, explains the seven categories of non-substance (Tannananavapadarthas), starting with the verse "Abhivandiun Siraasa". This section can also be considered to extend to 84 verses, as per the interpretation of the Amritachandra Tika.

3. **Third Mahaadhikars:** This section, comprising 20 verses, focuses on the path to liberation and the nature of liberation, starting with the verse "Jeevasvabhavo".

Therefore, the entire commentary consists of 181 verses, divided into three main sections.

**Sub-sections within the Mahaadhikars:**

Within each Mahaadhikars, there are further sub-sections (Antaraadhikars):

* **First Mahaadhikars:** This section is further divided into eight sub-sections:
    * **First Sub-section:** Seven verses, explaining the meaning of the term "Sabhavy", serving as an introduction.
    * **Second Sub-section:** Fourteen verses, explaining the substance (Dravyas).
    * **Third Sub-section:** Five verses, focusing on the substance of time (Kaaladravy).
    * **Fourth Sub-section:** 35 verses, explaining the soul substance (Jeevaastikaya).
    * **Fifth Sub-section:** Ten verses, focusing on the substance of matter (Pudgalastikaya).
    * **Sixth Sub-section:** Seven verses, explaining the substances of merit and demerit (Dharmaadharmastikaya).
    * **Seventh Sub-section:** Seven verses, explaining the substance of space (Aakaashaastikaya).
    * **Eighth Sub-section:** Eight verses, concluding with a summary of the Panchaastikaya.

* **Second Mahaadhikars:** This section is further divided into three sub-sections:
    * **First Sub-section:** Two verses, offering salutations to the chosen deities.
    * **Second Sub-section:** Three verses, providing a brief explanation of the Panchaastikaya.
    * **Third Sub-section:** One verse, defining the substances of the Panchaastikaya, including time.
    * **Fourth Sub-section:** One verse, addressing the potential for confusion and providing clarification.

**Conclusion:**

This commentary, the Panchaastikaya Praabhrut, provides a comprehensive and insightful explanation of the Panchaastikaya, the six substances that constitute the universe, and their relationship to the soul's liberation. It serves as a valuable guide for those seeking to understand the profound teachings of Jainism.

The *Pancastikaya* is written in Prakrit verses, describing the six substances. The commentary is in Sanskrit, composed by Jayasenacharya. [6] The language is not for children, the essence is not easily understood. Therefore, I have made this effort, meditating on the lotus feet of the Jinas. [7]

**Meaning:** I bow to the Supreme Being, who is self-realized, victorious over karma, pure soul, and eternally blissful.

**Introduction:** It is well known that Shri Kumaranandi, a disciple of Shri Kundakunda Acharya, who is also known as Padmanandi, Ailacharya, Vangriva, and Griddhapichcha, went to the land of the liberated souls. There, he saw the liberated, omniscient, and supreme Tirthankara, Shri Mandarswami, and listened to the divine words that emanated from his lotus mouth. He understood the meaning of the substances from those words and grasped the essence of the pure soul. Upon returning, he composed this *Pancastikaya* Prakrit scripture to explain the inner and outer aspects of the soul to his disciples, who were eager to learn, starting with Shivakumar Maharaj. This commentary explains the meaning of this scripture in detail, following the order of the chapters.

**Preface:** The first chapter, starting with "Indasayavandiaan," consists of 111 verses and describes the six substances. This chapter is also considered to be the first major chapter, according to the commentary of Shri Amrit Chandra, and ends with the 103rd verse. The second major chapter, starting with "Abhivandiun Siraasa," consists of 50 verses and explains the seven principles and nine substances. According to Shri Amrit Chandra's commentary, this chapter ends with the 48th verse. The third major chapter, starting with "Jivasvabhavo," consists of 20 verses and mainly discusses the path to liberation and the nature of liberation. Thus, there are three major chapters, consisting of 181 verses in total.

Now, we will discuss the sub-chapters within the first major chapter. Within the 111 verses, the verses starting with "Indasay" up to the seventh verse mainly explain the meaning of the word "time" in the preface. The next 14 verses explain the nature of the substances, based on the preface. The next five verses mainly discuss the substance of time. The following 33 verses describe the substance of the soul. The next 10 verses mainly discuss the substance of matter. The next seven verses explain the substances of merit, demerit, and space, based on the commentary. The next seven verses mainly discuss the substance of space. The last eight verses discuss the substance of the subtle body, in a concise manner. Thus, the first major chapter, which describes the six substances, consists of eight sub-chapters.

**The Beginning of the Sutra**

**Salutation to the Jinas**

At the beginning of this scripture, the auspiciousness of salutation to the Jinas, in the form of the invocation of the nature of the Jinas, has been obtained by the words, "Namo Jinēbhyah."

**Verse 1**

"To those who are saluted by hundreds of Indras, whose words are sweet, clear, and beneficial to the three worlds, whose qualities are beyond limit, and who have conquered existence, to those Jinas, salutation."

**Explanation**

"Saluted by hundreds of Indras" - This indicates that they are worthy of being saluted by all, as they are the supreme lords of the gods.

"Whose words are sweet, clear, and beneficial to the three worlds" - This refers to the fact that their teachings are pure, free from all doubts, and beneficial to all beings in the three worlds (heaven, earth, and hell).

"Whose qualities are beyond limit" - This refers to their infinite knowledge, power, and compassion.

"Who have conquered existence" - This refers to their liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

**The Introduction to the Concept of Time**

These seven verses serve as an introduction to the concept of time. The first two verses are a salutation to the Jinas, while the next three verses provide a brief explanation of the five categories of time. The sixth verse defines the five categories of time in terms of substance, and the seventh verse discusses the rejection of the defects of confusion and contradiction. Thus, the introduction to the concept of time is divided into three parts: salutation, explanation, and definition.

**Verse 1**

**Word-by-word meaning:**

(Indrashatavanditēbhyah) - To those who are saluted by hundreds of Indras,
(Tribhuvanahitamdhuravishadavakyēbhyah) - whose words are beneficial to the three worlds, sweet, and clear,
(Antatītaguṇēbhyah) - whose qualities are beyond limit,
(Jitabhāvēbhyah) - who have conquered existence,
(Jinēbhyah) - to those Jinas,
(Namah) - salutation.

Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas
Translation by Samyai: Here (in this verse), by saying "Salutations to the Jinas," an extraordinary auspiciousness in the form of devotional salutations has been described at the beginning of the scriptures. "Those who are flowing from an eternal stream and are flowing from an eternal stream, are saluted by a hundred Indras." By saying this, it has been said that they [the Jina Devas] are worthy of extraordinary salutations because of their eternal nature as the supreme among the gods. Their speech, that is, the divine sound, is beneficial because it tells the entire group of living beings in the three realms, the upper, lower, and middle realms, the means of attaining the pure self-nature. It is sweet because it captivates the minds of those who are interested in the ultimate truth, and it is clear [pure, distinct] because it removes all doubts and other defects." - By saying this, [the Jina Devas] are worthy of the respect of wise and intelligent men because they are the teachers of the true nature of all things [that is, their teachings should be considered with respect by wise and intelligent men]. It has been said that they have infinite qualities, which are the play of the supreme conscious power, without end in space and without end in time. By saying this, [the Jinas] are bound by the yogis who have attained supreme knowledge, because they manifest supreme and extraordinary knowledge. "They have conquered the world, that is, the cycle of birth and death." By saying this, it has been taught that they [the Jinas] are the refuge of other living beings who have not yet achieved liberation, because they have manifested their own liberation. This is the meaning of all the words.
Meaning:
-
First, keeping in mind the intention of describing an extraordinary auspiciousness in the form of devotional salutations to the Jinas at the beginning of the scriptures, beginning with "Salutations to those who are saluted by a hundred Indras," this sutra is explained. The explanation is in the form of a breakdown of the words "णमो जिणाणं," which means "Salutations to the Jinas." To whom are the salutations? To the Jinas. What kind of Jinas? "इंदसयवंदियाणं" - those who are saluted by a hundred Indras. Again, what kind of Jinas? "तिहुवणहिदमहुरबिसदवक्काणंत्रिभुवनहितमधुरविशदवाक्येभ्यः" - those whose words are beneficial to the three realms, sweet, and clear. Again, what is special about them? "अंतातीदगुणाणं" - those who have infinite qualities. Again, what is special about them? "जिदभवाणं" - those who have conquered the world. This is the relationship between the action and the agent. "Salutations to the Jinas, those who are saluted by a hundred Indras, whose words are beneficial to the three realms, sweet, and clear, who have infinite qualities, and who have conquered the world." According to the sutra "पदयोर्विवक्षितः संधिर्न समासान्तरगतयो," the intended compound is not within the scope of the compound. Therefore, it should be known that there is no rule for compounding in this text, for the sake of easy understanding for the primary student. Thus, this is a summary statement that devotional salutations in the form of remembering their infinite knowledge and other qualities are offered to the Jinas, who have these four qualities. Now it is said - "Those who are saluted by a hundred Indras," by saying this, the intention is to describe the greatness of their worship. What is being said? Are they the only ones worthy of being saluted by a hundred Indras? No, because they have witnessed the battles between the gods and demons. Their words are beneficial because they teach the means of attaining the pure self-nature. They are sweet because they are the source of the ultimate happiness, which is the taste of the nectar of the ultimate truth, and they captivate the minds of those who are interested in the ultimate truth. They are clear because they are free from doubts, confusion, and delusion, which are like the touch of grass on a pearl, and they are the form of pure knowledge of the seven principles and nine substances.

Page #11:
---------------------------
From the fact that it is the expounder of the five-fold nature of the substance, or from the fact that it is free from defects like contradiction, or from the fact that it is the clear and distinct expression of the language of each of the Karnata, Magadha, Malava, Lata, Gauda, and Gurjara, in the form of eighteen great languages, seven hundred minor languages, and many languages, simultaneously for all beings, and from the fact that it is the cause of understanding and the informer of all beings, the divine sound, whose words are sweet, clear, and beneficial to the three worlds, is from them. Thus it is said: "That which is beneficial to all beings, not accompanied by any caste, not uttered by moving lips, not desired, not tainted by any fault, not obstructed by any obstacle. Heard by the ears of the peaceful, angry, and poisonous, along with the animals, that word of the all-knowing, which has destroyed all calamities, may protect us from the beginning." By expounding the excellence of this word, it is said that this word itself is the proof, and not the word of the non-human, nor the word of the mythical story, nor the word of the imagined Purana. From the fact that it is the determiner of the substance, space, time, and state beyond the end, the perfect knowledge quality exists in those who are beyond the end, those who have the quality beyond the end are from them. By expounding the excellence of knowledge, it is said that even the great yogis like Ganadharadeva, who possess the sevenfold knowledge, including intellect, and the fourfold knowledge, including omniscience, are worthy of worship. Those who have conquered the fivefold cycle of existence, which is eternal and swift, are from them. By expounding the excellence of the conqueror of the cycle of existence, it is said that they are the refuge of others who have not achieved their goal, and not others. Thus, salutations to those who possess these four qualities. This salutation is done in the form of remembrance of the qualities like infinite knowledge, etc. This fourfold quality conquers the karma-afflicted, who are the cause of suffering from many deep subjects. In the case of the derivation, it is for the purpose of stating the nature like a white conch shell, and in the case of non-derivation, it is for the purpose of defining the name Jina. Thus, the meaning of the word is stated in the form of the relationship between the qualified and the qualifier. The salutation in the form of remembrance of the qualities like infinite knowledge, etc., is according to the impure determination, the salutation of the substance in the form of the word "namo jinēbhyaḥ" is according to the false behavior, and the salutation in the form of the word "namo jinēbhyaḥ" is according to the pure determination, the attitude of worshiping oneself is according to the principle of the word. The meaning of the principle is also stated in the form of "they are worthy of worship, not others." The meaning of the scripture is well-known, like "Indra is praised by hundreds." The meaning of the sentiment is that the pure being, who possesses the qualities like infinite knowledge, etc., is the only one who is worthy of worship. In this way, the meaning of the word, principle, scripture, and sentiment is indicated. In this way, the meaning of the word, principle, scripture, and sentiment is to be applied everywhere during the explanation. In short, the salutation to the desired deity is done for the sake of auspiciousness. The auspiciousness, the indication, the cause, the reason, the quantity, and the non-doer are the six chapters, which are to be spoken as far as possible. Now, according to the principle of behavior, the explanation of the six chapters, starting with auspiciousness, with limited qualifications, is done for the benefit of the students who are interested in details.
"Mangala-nimitta-heū parimāṇā nāma taha ya kattāraṁ.

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

The description of the six substances and five astikayas is given in three ways, depending on the deity:

* **By whom:** This refers to the specific deity being invoked.
* **By the desired outcome:** This refers to the specific benefit sought from the deity.
* **By the type of salutation:** This refers to the specific form of salutation used.

This auspiciousness is of two types: primary and secondary.

**Primary auspiciousness** is described as follows: "It is said that auspiciousness is spoken of by the wise at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end." This is followed by a hymn praising the qualities of Jinendra, for the purpose of removing obstacles and achieving success.

**Secondary auspiciousness** is described as follows:

* "The auspiciousness of the Siddhattha, the Punna-kumbha, the garland of salutations, the white umbrella, the seat, the color, the auspiciousness of the voice, the ears, and the tongue."
* "The auspiciousness of the merchant, the restraint, the guru, the association with the Jina, the supreme goal, the Siddhasana, the Siddhattha."
* "The auspiciousness of the Punna, the mind, the knowledge, the complete knowledge, the Arhat, the Punna-kumbha."
* "The auspiciousness of the exit and entry, the twenty-four salutations, the garland of salutations, the mind."
* "The auspiciousness of the umbrella, the Arhat, the umbrella, the Siddhi."
* "The auspiciousness of the seat, the color, the meditation, the knowledge, the remaining karma, the Arhat, the seat, the color."
* "The auspiciousness of the world, the complete knowledge, the Jina, the auspiciousness of the moon, the moon."
* "The auspiciousness of the heroes, the Jina, the world, the auspiciousness of the horse, the horse."
* "The auspiciousness of the blacksmith, the Jina, the liberation, the auspiciousness of the four, the four."

Alternatively, auspiciousness is also described as being of two types: bound and unbound.

**Bound auspiciousness** is described as follows: "The leader of the path to liberation, etc."

**Unbound auspiciousness** is described as follows: "Salutation taken from other scriptures, such as 'To the Lord of the three worlds,' etc."

In this context, the student raises an objection: "Why do the authors of scriptures begin their scriptures with a hymn praising the qualities of the Supreme Being for auspiciousness? Why not simply begin with the subject matter of the scripture? Auspiciousness is irrelevant."

The teacher responds: "It is not irrelevant. Auspiciousness brings merit, and merit removes obstacles."

The student counters: "Why is this necessary? There are instances where obstacles are encountered even after performing salutations, offerings, and worship. Conversely, there are instances where obstacles are not encountered even without performing salutations, offerings, and worship."

The teacher explains: "This is not a contradiction. The ancient teachers always performed actions preceded by salutations to their chosen deities. As you said, performing salutations brings merit, and merit removes obstacles. This is not irrelevant. Why? Because this is well-established in logic and other scriptures. Furthermore, the instances you mentioned are not contradictions. When obstacles are encountered even after performing salutations, offerings, and worship, it is because of the fruits of past negative karma, not a flaw in the act of worship. Conversely, when obstacles are not encountered even without performing salutations, offerings, and worship, it is because of the fruits of past positive karma, not a lack of negative karma."

The student continues: "Is the scripture auspicious or inauspicious? If it is auspicious, then what is the purpose of making it even more auspicious? If it is inauspicious, then what is the purpose of the scripture?"

The teacher responds: "Auspiciousness is made even more auspicious for the sake of devotion. As it is said, 'One may worship the sun with a lamp, the ocean with water, and the goddess of speech with auspicious words.' Furthermore, performing salutations to the chosen deity is considered a reciprocal act of kindness."

Page #13:
---------------------------
"The perfection of the path of liberation comes from the grace of the Supreme Being. This is what the great sages say in the scriptures like the Gunastotra." (17) "The means to achieve the desired result is easy to understand, and it comes from studying the scriptures. This is why the virtuous never forget the kindness shown to them by the enlightened." (18) This is the explanation of the auspiciousness of the consecration.

The reason is explained: What is the reason for the initiation of the scripture of the omniscient, free from attachment, and divine sound? It is due to the inspiration of the auspicious souls. As it is said, "The auspicious souls see the rise of this auspicious sun, which shines brightly due to the efforts of the devotees." (19) In the Prabhrit Grantha, Shiva Kumar Maharaj says that the reason is to be understood elsewhere, such as in the collection of substances, the excellence of the mind, etc. This is a brief explanation of the reason. Now, the explanation of the cause. The cause is the fruit. If you ask how the word "cause" refers to the fruit, it is because the fruit is the effect of the cause. And that fruit is of two types, based on the distinction between direct and indirect. Direct fruit is of two types, based on the distinction between direct and indirect experience. What is direct experience? It is the destruction of ignorance, the birth of knowledge, the destruction of countless karmas, etc. What is indirect experience? It is the worship of the teacher and the disciple, praise, the emergence of disciples, etc. This is a brief explanation of the direct fruit. Now, the indirect fruit is explained. It is of two types, based on the distinction between worldly happiness and liberation. Worldly happiness is explained. It is the state of being a king of kings, a great king, a ruler of a kingdom, a great ruler, a half-wheel-turner, a full-wheel-turner, Indra, a Ganadhara deva, a Tirthankara, a supreme deity, and the three auspicious ones. The characteristics of a king, etc., are explained: One who is the lord of eighteen rows of a crore of fortresses is called a crowned king, one who is the lord of five hundred crowned kings is called a king of kings, and from there, it increases twofold, twofold, until the state of a full-wheel-turner. This is worldly happiness. Now, liberation is explained. The state of an Arhat is explained: "The Arhat is the middle of the auspicious ones, with thirty-four hundredfold powers, fourfold knowledge, and fivefold auspiciousness, and eight great virtues." (20) The state of a Siddha is explained: "The Siddhas are auspicious, eightfold, beyond the cycle of birth and death, free from the bondage of the five karmas, the seven bonds, and the eight types of birth." (21) This is a brief explanation of worldly happiness and liberation. The meaning here is that whoever studies and believes in the scriptures like the Panchastikaya collection, which was compiled by the omniscient, free from attachment, will attain this kind of happiness. Now, the extent is explained. It is of two types, based on the distinction between the meaning of the scripture and the scripture itself. The extent of the scripture is the number of scriptures, as far as possible, and the extent of the meaning is infinite. These two are distinguished as meaningful and accidental. What is meaningful? The meaning is the same as the name, such as "tapan" means "sun" because it burns. And the scripture in which the Panchastikaya is found is called the Panchastikaya, the collection of substances is called the Dravyasangraha, etc. Accidental is like "Ishvara" being the name of a wooden weight, etc. The author is explained. He is of three types: the original author, the subsequent author, and the subsequent subsequent author. The original author, according to time, is Shri Vardhamana Swami, who is free from eighteen faults and possesses the four infinite qualities. The subsequent author is Shri Gautam Swami, the Ganadhara deva, who is four-treasured and possesses seven half-qualities. The subsequent subsequent authors are many, as far as possible. Why is the author explained? It is to show that the scripture is authoritative because of the authority of the author. This is a brief explanation of the six chapters of the auspiciousness. This is the auspiciousness, and the verses of salutation to the desired deities have been recited. (1)

## Six Substances - Description of Five Astikayas - Hindi Meaning Commentary

First, in the beginning of this scripture, with the intention of offering a unique auspicious salutation to the Jinas, in the form of the sentiment expressed by the hundred Indras, the Acharya states the first sutra:

**10**

**General Meaning with Anvaya:** (Indasadbandiyaṇam) Saluted by a hundred Indras, (Tihuṇa-Hidamdhura-Visad-Vakkāṇam) Benefactor of the three worlds, speaking sweet and clear words, (Antaati-Guṇāṇam) Possessor of infinite qualities, and (Jidbhavaṇam) Conqueror of the world, (Jiṇāṇam) To the Arhats (Naṃo) Salutations.

**Specific Meaning:** Here, the Arhats are being saluted. The remembrance of the infinite knowledge and other qualities of the Arhats is called a salutation of sentiment. It is said that a hundred Indras saluted the Arhats, thereby revealing the greatness of the Arhats' worthiness. It is also stated that these Arhats are the only deities worthy of being saluted by a hundred Indras. The words of the Arhats are beneficial because they show the way to attain the nature of the pure soul. The natural, unparalleled, supreme bliss that arises from the samadhi free from attachment and distractions, that is the certainty of happiness, the taste of its essence, that is the supreme state of equanimity, those who are attracted to its essence, those human beings, are captivating to their minds, and they are clear and expressed, because there is no doubt, delusion, or confusion in those words. This is a shell or silver, such fickle knowledge is called doubt. The desire to be certain that something will happen when the grass touches the foot is called delusion. To know the shell as silver is delusion. And those words are also clear because they describe the seven principles, nine substances, six substances, and five astikayas, starting with the pure jiva astikaya. Or, there is no contradiction between the past and the future in those words, which also makes them clear. Or, all beings hear the divine sound of the Arhats in their own language and understand it clearly. There are eighteen major languages, including Kannada, Magadhi, Malwa, Lata, Gauda, and Gurjara, each with three divisions, and seven hundred minor languages, and that voice is heard by all at the same time in many languages, which also makes it clear.

**In other scriptures, it is said about the words of the Arhats:**

That unparalleled word of the omniscient Lord, free from all defects, protects us, which is beneficial to all souls, is not in the form of letters, manifests without the movement of the lips, is without desire, is not stained by faults, and does not have the sequence of stopping and starting of breath.

Page #15:
---------------------------
The five-astīkāya, beginning with the one who has pacified the poison of anger, which even the animal kingdom can hear with their ears. ||1|| Thus, the word of the Arhant, revealed through the greatness of the word, is the proof. The word that is secluded, non-human, not spoken by any man, and not composed of various stories, is the proof of the Purāṇa.

**Meaning:** The word is the proof that describes through anekanta or syādvāda, and that is spoken by the tradition of a सर्वज्ञ (omniscient) man. It is said that the Arhants have infinite knowledge, etc., because they know the infinite dravya, kṣetra, kāla, and bhāva. This means that they are worthy of worship, even by the Ganadhara Devas, who are the holders of the seven ṛiddhis, such as buddhi, and the four jñānas, such as matijñāna. The Arhants have conquered the world, which is in the form of the five parāvartanās, namely dravya, kṣetra, kāla, bhava, and bhāva. This means that they have achieved their purpose through the greatness of the destruction of the yātiyas and the konkas. For those who are not accomplished, who are ignorant worldly beings, the Arhants are the only refuge. Thus, the Jinas have been worshipped with four special qualities. This is a worshipful feeling of remembering the infinite knowledge, etc. The Jina is the one who conquers the enemies in the form of karma, which are the causes of falling into the many forests in the form of bhava, the objects of the senses, and the calamities. These four qualities are given to him in the same way as saying that the conch is white. Even by simply saying conch, one understands its whiteness. Similarly, by the mere etymology of the word Jina, one understands his infinite qualities. However, the qualities are given to show the specialness and to indicate that the worship is not for those who are called Jina only in name. This is the meaning of the special quality and the special object. This is the meaning of the word.

The feeling of remembering the infinite knowledge, etc., is the worship. To know it through the impure niścaya naya is to know the word "namo jinebhyaḥ" as a dravya in the form of worship. To know it through the asadbhuta vyavahāra naya is to know it as a worshipful object and a worshipper in one's own soul. To know it through the pure niścaya naya is to know it as a non-dual feeling, that this soul is worthy of worship and is the worshipper. This is the meaning of the naya. These Arhant Devas are worthy of worship, not any other passionate, hateful, or ignorant being. This reveals the meaning of the Jina dharma. Saying that they are worthy of worship by a hundred Indras reveals the meaning of the tradition and the āgama. The meaning of this mangalācaraṇa is that only the pure jīvāstīkāya, which is endowed with infinite knowledge, etc., is worthy of acceptance. Thus, one should know the meaning of the word, the meaning of the naya, the meaning of the dharma, the meaning of the āgama, and the meaning of the feeling. In the same way, wherever...

## 12. Description of the Five Categories of Substance

**Explanation:** In all places, one should understand the meaning of the five categories: words, logic, opinion, scripture, and emotion. In this way, for auspiciousness, the desired deity is saluted. Auspiciousness is a suggestive term, and along with it, five things should be mentioned as much as possible: the purpose of the text, the reason, the extent, the name, and the author.

Now, here, for the sake of students who are interested in hearing in detail, a special explanation of the six categories, starting with auspiciousness, is given, relying on the practical logic. This is an ancient saying:

"The great teacher, before doing anything else, should first mention the six: auspiciousness, purpose, reason, extent, name, and author, and then explain the scripture." (2)

The same is shown further:

(1) "Mangal" means that which melts or destroys evil or sin, or that which brings virtue and happiness, that is, gives it, is auspicious. The author of the text, desiring four types of results in the beginning of the scripture, salutes the deity in three ways. The four types of results are:

**Meaning:** To show that the author of the text is a believer, to follow the rules of courtesy and humility that have come down through tradition, to gain merit, and to remove obstacles. For these four reasons, the deity is praised at the beginning of the text. (3)

The three ways of saluting the deity are: that which is desired, that which is authorized, and that which is respectable. There are also three types of salutation: one is in the form of a blessing, the second is in the form of a statement of the nature of the object, and the third is in the form of a simple salutation.

This auspiciousness is of two types: primary and secondary. The primary auspiciousness is the praise of the qualities of the Jina. As it is said:

**Meaning:** The wise have said that one should perform auspiciousness at the beginning, middle, and end, so that obstacles are destroyed. That auspiciousness is the praise of the qualities of the Jina. (4)

It is also said:

**Meaning:** By praising the qualities of the Jinas, obstacles are destroyed, fear never arises, inferior deities do not transgress, and one always obtains the desired objects. (5)

It is also said:

Page #17:
---------------------------
The disciple becomes proficient in knowledge by doing auspicious things at the beginning, including the five auspicious things, the meaning, etc., the knowledge comes without obstacles by doing auspicious things in the middle, and the fruit of knowledge is obtained by doing auspicious things at the end. ||6||
Further, the secondary auspicious things are called:
Meaning - Siddhartha, Purnakumbha, Vandanamaala, Shwetachatra, Shwetavarna, Aadarasha or Darpan, Naath (King), Kanya and Jayapana. ||7||
Those who have achieved the ultimate goal through vows, rules, restraint, etc., and whose name is Siddha, are therefore Siddhartha auspicious. ||8||
Those who are full of all desires and only knowledge, such Arhants are Purnakumbha auspicious in this world. ||9||
Bharat Chakra created the Vandanamaala, when someone exits or enters through a door, they become worthy of being worshipped by the twenty-four Tirthankaras, therefore Vandanamaala is called auspicious. ||10||
For the beings of the world, Arhant Bhagwan is the easy doer, they are like protectors, therefore they are called Shwetachatra. ||11||
Those Arhants who have white color, white meditation, and whose four non-virtuous karmas remain, such Arhants are called Shwetavarna auspicious. ||12||
Just as the reflection appears in the mirror, similarly, the world and the non-world are seen in the only knowledge of the Jineendras, therefore Aadarasha is auspicious. ||13||
Just as the Vitaraga Sarvagya Jineendra is auspicious, similarly, the king and the child girl in the world should also be considered auspicious. ||14||
Those who have conquered the enemies of karma and attained liberation - conquering the four armies of enemies, which are the four types of karma, is called Jayarupa auspicious. ||15||
Or, auspiciousness is of two types - one is bound auspiciousness, the other is unbound auspiciousness. The auspiciousness that is done by the same author of the text is bound auspiciousness, such as 'Mokshamargasya Netaram' etc. The auspiciousness that is brought from another text and used for salutation is unbound auspiciousness, such as "Jagattrayanaathay" etc.
In this regard, some disciple raises this prior argument and argues that - why do the authors of the scriptures praise the qualities of the Supreme Being for auspiciousness at the beginning of the scriptures? One should only say what is being started, there is no need for auspiciousness. It should also not be said that auspiciousness in the form of salutation brings merit, and merit makes the work free from obstacles, because saying so leads to contradiction. Sometimes, obstacles are seen while doing salutation, donation, worship, etc., and sometimes, work is seen to be free from obstacles even without donation, worship, and salutation? The Acharya solves this by saying - O disciple! Your saying this is not appropriate. In the past, the Acharyas started the work only after saluting the Ishtadevata first.

## Chapter 14

The six substances and five astikayas were described. You said that one should not say that namaskara (salutation) leads to punya (merit) and punya prevents obstacles. This statement of yours is also not correct, because it has been proven in logic and other disciplines that saluting the deity leads to punya and punya leads to obstacle-free actions. Then you said that believing this leads to vyabhichar (deviation). This is also not correct, because where obstacles occur even while performing dharma (righteousness) like saluting the deity, giving charity, and worship, one should understand that it is the result of past sins, not a fault of the means of dharma. And where obstacle-free actions are seen even without performing dharma like saluting the deity, giving charity, and worship, one should understand that it is the result of past dharma, not the result of sins. Then the disciple asks: Is the scripture itself auspicious or inauspicious? If the scripture is auspicious, then what is the purpose of doing auspicious things with auspicious things? And if the scripture is inauspicious, then what purpose will be achieved from such a scripture? The Acharya Maharaj also provides a solution to this: Auspicious things are done for the sake of devotion. As it is said:

**Meaning:** People worship the sun with a lamp, the ocean with water, and Saraswati (goddess of learning) with speech, just like this, auspicious things are worshipped with auspicious things. ||16||

And also, saluting the Ishtadevata (chosen deity) leads to acceptance of their favor, as it is said:

**Meaning:** The attainment of the path of liberation is through the grace of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, in the scriptures, the main ones praise their qualities at the beginning. ||17||

And it is also said:

**Meaning:** The means of attaining the desired result is right knowledge. Right knowledge comes from the true scriptures. The origin of those scriptures is from the Aapta (divine beings). Therefore, those Aapta Devas are worthy of worship, through whose grace there are three types of intellect. Righteous people do not forget the favors done to them. ||18||

In this way, the auspiciousness has been stated briefly. Next, the cause for which this scripture was created is called the cause of the cause. The reason for the divine sound being manifested by the Vitaraga Sarvagna Bhagwan is the inspiration of the punya of the bhavya jivas (evolving souls). As it is said:

**Meaning:** The bhavya jivas, through the divine radiance of the sun in the form of Shrutagyan (scriptural knowledge), have faith in the knowledge of the six substances and nine substances. Therefore, the sun in the form of Shrutagyan rises. ||19||

Here, the cause of this Prabhrit Granth (this scripture) is Shiv Kumar Maharaj. Just as in the Dravyasangrah (collection of substances) and other scriptures, Moma Seth and others were the cause, it should be understood in this way. In this way, the cause has been explained briefly. Now...

---------------------------
The **Panchaastikaya Praabhrut** explains 15 **Hetukas**. **Hetuka** is also called **Phal** (fruit) because it is the cause of the fruit, hence it is called **Phal** by implication. This **Phal** is of two types: **Pratyaksha Phal** (direct fruit) and **Paroksha Phal** (indirect fruit). **Pratyaksha Phal** is also of two types: **Saakshaat** (direct) and **Parampara** (tradition). **Saakshaat Pratyaksha Phal** is the destruction of ignorance and the birth of **Samyaggyaan** (right knowledge) from this scripture, and the destruction of countless **Karma** (actions) in the form of **Gun श्रेणी** (series of qualities), etc. **Parampara-Pratyaksha-Phal** is the worship and praise of the teacher by the disciple, and the acquisition of disciples. **Bhaavarth** (meaning): Many people benefit from reading it. This is how **Pratyaksha Phal** is explained in brief. Now, **Paroksha Phal** is explained. This is also of two types: **Saansaarik Aishvarya Sukh** (worldly prosperity and happiness) and **Moksha-Sukh** (liberation happiness). Now, **Aishvarya Sukh** is explained. **Rajaadhiraaj**, **Maharaaja**, **Ardhamandaleek**, **Mandaleek**, **Mahamaandaleek**, **Ardhachkravarti**, **Chakravarti**, **Indra**, **Ganathar Dev**, **Teerthankar Paramdev** - these 18 categories are the leaders of the army, crown-wearers. The overlord of five hundred crown-wearers is **Adhiraaja**, and from there, the owners of twice the number of troops, up to **Sakal Chakravarti**, this is **Aishvarya Sukh**. Now, **Moksha** or **Param Kalyanmay Sukh** (supreme blissful happiness) is explained. It is the attainment of the **Arhant** and **Siddh** state. The nature of **Arhant** is explained: Those who have destroyed the four **Ghatiya Karmas** (destructive actions) and attained the thirty-four **Atishya** (supernatural powers), eight **Praatihaarya** (miracles), and five **Kalyanak** (auspicious events) are **Arhant**. They are auspicious for me. ||20|| The nature of **Siddh** is explained: Those who are free from the bondage, arising, and existence of **Mool** (root) and **Uttar** (later) **Karma** (actions), who possess eight qualities, and who have transcended the world, are the auspicious **Siddh Bhagwan** (liberated beings). ||21|| This is how **Aishvarya** and **Moksha Sukh** are explained in brief. The implication is that whoever reads this **Panchaastikaya Praabhrut** etc. scripture, which is spoken by the **Veetaraag Sarvgyaan** (omniscient, free from attachment), with faith, and contemplates it repeatedly, attains this kind of happiness. Now, **Parimaan** (quantity) is explained. It is of two types: **Granth Parimaan** (textual quantity) and **Arth Parimaan** (meaning quantity). **Granth Parimaan** is the number of verses or stanzas in the text, which should be known as much as possible. **Arth Parimaan** is infinite. This is how **Parimaan** is explained in brief. Now, **Naam** (name) is explained. **Naam** is of two types: **Anvarth** (literal) and **Ichchhit** (desired). If the meaning of the text is the same as its name, it is **Anvarth**. For example, **Tapa** (heat) is **Tapan** (heat) or **Surya** (sun). Similarly, the scripture in which the five **Astikaya** are explained is **Panchaastikaya**, or the scripture that contains a collection of **Dravya** (substance) is **Dravya Sangrah**, etc. **Ichchhit Naam** is like calling the one who carries the load of wood **Ishwar** (God), etc. Now, the **Karta** (author) of the text is explained. **Karta** is of three types: **Mool Tantra Karta** (original author), **Uttar Tantra Karta** (later author), and **Utteroottar Tantra Karta** (successive author). Among these, the **Mool Tantra Karta** is the last **Teerthankar** of this time, the eighteenth...

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

The author is the faultless, infinite fourfold, Shri Vardhamana Swami. The commentator of the Uttara Tantra is the four-knowledgeable and seven-wealthy Shri Gautam Swami, the Ganadhara. There are many other commentators in succession. 

**Meaning:** Here, the author of this text is Shri Kundakunda Acharya. The author says this because the authority of the author establishes the authority of his words. In this way, the six aspects of auspiciousness, cause, reason, quantity, name, and author have been described in brief. In this way, the verse related to the salutation of the Ishta Devata for auspiciousness is complete.

**Verse 2: Explanation of Time**

**Time** is the Agama. It has been promised here to be described after salutation. 

(The meaning of the verse) The teachings from the mouth of the Shramanas, which are the cessation of the four gatis and Nirvana. 

I bow my head and will speak of this time, listen. || 2 ||

It is appropriate to bow and describe it because it is successful due to being taught by an Apt. There, its being taught by an Apt is because it is the meaning that has come from the mouth of the Shramanas. The Shramanas are the great Shramanas, the omniscient, the free from passions. The meaning, again, is one thing to be described, though it is described through many words. Its success is because it is the cessation of the four gatis, which are hell, animal, human, and god, and because it is the cause of Nirvana, which is the cessation of dependence, the attainment of pure self-nature, and because it is the cause of the fruit, which is the attainment of independence. || 2 ||

**Hindi Explanation of Verse 2**

**Meaning:** (The meaning that has come from the mouth of the Shramanas) The meaning that has come from the mouth of the Shramanas (the words spoken by the omniscient great monks) (the cessation of the four gatis) the cessation of the four gatis and (Nirvana) Nirvana (the cause of Nirvana) [this time] such this time [bowing my head] bowing my head in salutation (I will speak) I will speak of it [listen] listen to it.

**Commentary:** Time means Agama. I will speak of it after saluting it. Such a promise has been made here. It (time) is worthy of salutation and description because it is successful due to being taught by an Apt. There, its being taught by an Apt is because it is the meaning that has come from the mouth of the Shramanas (the omniscient). 'Shramanas' means the great Shramanas, the omniscient, the free from passions, and 'meaning' means one thing to be described, though it is described through many words.

Page #21:
---------------------------
## 17

The success of time (kāla) is due to the fact that it (1) prevents the four paths of hell (narka), animal existence (tiryanch), human existence (manushya), and godhood (devatva), and (2) leads to the attainment of pure soul (ātma) essence, which is characterized by freedom from dependence (paratantra) and the attainment of independence (svatantrata), and is the ultimate cause of liberation (nirvāṇa) in a sequential manner. ||2||

Page #22:
---------------------------
## Chapter 18: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

**How is the description of the six substances and five astikayas?**

The explanation is the Acharya's words in the form of a commentary, the Gatha Sutra is to be explained, this is the commentary to be explained. 

**Relationship:**

The word "dravya" (substance) refers to the meaning of the word "agama" (scripture), "rupa" (form), "sabda" (sound), and "samaya" (time). The word "panchaastikaya" (five astikayas) refers to the meaning of the word "lakshana" (characteristics) and "artha" (meaning) and "samaya" (time). This is the relationship between the word and its meaning. 

**Result and Purpose:**

The result and purpose are to eliminate ignorance, etc., and to attain the ultimate bliss of Nirvana. These relationships, meanings, and purposes should be known.

**Meaning:**

Thus, the first part of the text has been covered with two verses, primarily with the salutation to the desired and chosen deity.

**Hindi Meaning:**

**Verse 2:**

After saluting the word "agama" (scripture) which is in the form of the "dravya" (substance) shastra, I will describe the meaning of the "panchaastikaya" (five astikayas) in the form of "artha" (meaning) and "samaya" (time). With this promise, I salute my honorable deity, who is attained in the authority, and I indicate the relationship, meaning, and purpose. This is the intention in my mind, and I will now speak the next sutra.

**Meaning with Anvaya:**

(Eso) This I, who am Kundakunda Acharya, (samana muhuggadam) having emerged from the mouth of the great Shraman, who is free from attachment and omniscient, (chaduggadinivaranam) who removes the four gatis (paths) of hell, etc., (sanivvanam) who gives Nirvana, the destruction of all karmas, (attha) to the group of substances, including the jiva (soul), (sirasa) with the best part of my head, (panamiya) I salute, (inam samayan) this word "agama" (scripture) and "panchaastikaya" (five astikayas), (vochchhami) I will speak, (sunah) O noble beings! Listen to it.

**Meaning:**

May that word of the Jina, which is profound, sweet, very captivating, free from faults, beneficial, free from the causes of speech like the throat, lips, etc., not revealed by the stopping of the wind, clear, the speaker of the ultimate beneficial substances, all language-based, heard equally by the distant and the near, in the form of equality, and free from comparisons, protect us.

**Meaning:**

By which the spread of the darkness of ignorance is removed, and by which, upon knowing the beneficial and harmful substances that are to be known, the being attains the abandonment of the harmful, the acceptance of the beneficial, and ultimate detachment, by which right faith is revealed, and the faith in the false is removed, and by which the false conduct of night and day is kept away, may the rise of that knowledge-like ultimate sun take place in the blossoming of my mind-like lotus, or another explanation is as follows: This I, who am Kundakunda Acharya, who is eager to do the work of writing the text, having emerged from the mouth of the Shraman, and who speaks the meaning of the "panchaastikaya" (five astikayas) with characteristics, and who is the direct witness of the "dravya" (substance) "agama" (scripture) in the form of words, which removes the four gatis (paths) and gives Nirvana, I salute, and for the sake of the fame of knowledge-time...

Page #23:
---------------------------
## The Five Astikayas and Time

**19**

I will speak of the time, a near-perfect man, a liberated, omniscient, hears the word-agamas, then knows the meaning of the five astikayas, which is the essence of the agamas. Then, in that group of objects, he becomes firm in the pure jiva-astikaya, and eliminates the four movements. By eliminating the four movements, he attains the fifth movement, nirvana. There, he experiences infinite bliss, the fruit of nirvana, which is characterized by freedom from suffering, arising from his own soul. Therefore, it is right to bow down to this time, which is in the form of a substance, or the word-agamas.

In this explanation, the relationship, the object, and the purpose are indicated as follows:

The words of the Acharya, which are in the form of an explanation, are the explanation. The gatha sutras are worthy of explanation, so they are the object of explanation. This is the relationship between the explanation and the object of explanation.

The word-time or agamas, which is in the form of a substance, is the name - the speaker. The meaning of the five astikayas, which is the essence of the word-time or agamas, is the object of speech - the thing to be spoken. This is the relationship between the name and the object of speech.

The fruit or purpose is the attainment of nirvana bliss, which includes the destruction of ignorance, etc. In this way, one should know the relationship, the object, and the purpose.

In this way, the first section is completed with two gathas, mainly for the purpose of bowing down to one's beloved and honorable deity. || 2 ||

**Time Explanation Gatha - 3**

Here, the word "time" has three meanings: word, knowledge, and object. The division of the world and the non-world is also mentioned.

The five astikayas are called "time" by the best Jinas. That which is the world is the five astikayas, then the non-world is the infinite, and the space is the void. || 3 ||

There, the middle ground of the five astikayas, which is not affected by attachment and aversion, and which is characterized by the arrangement of letters, words, and sentences, is the word-time, the word-agamas, and so on.

The elimination of the rise of false views in them is the right path, the knowledge-time, the knowledge-agamas, and so on.

The combination of these, which is limited by name, understanding, and definition, is the object-time, the essence of all objects, and so on.

Here, the object-time is intended to be explained in relation to the word-time, in order to make the knowledge-time clear. Therefore, the object-time itself has two forms, due to the alternative of the world and the non-world.

The combination of the five astikayas is the world, as long as it exists. Beyond that is the infinite non-world. It is not merely non-existence, but an infinite field, space, and void, which is beyond the combination of the five astikayas. || 3 ||

Page #24:
---------------------------
## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

**Hindi Commentary Verse 3: Anvayaartha (Dialogue of the Five)**

The five Astikayas are described in an equal manner (or) their Samavaya (the five Astikayas' correct understanding or their collective whole) is the time (Samaya). This is what the Jinas have said. That is the Lok (world) (the Lok is as much as the group of the five Astikayas). Beyond that is the infinite Alok (non-world) (Khamba) which is the form of space.

**Commentary:**

Here (in this verse), the word "Samaya" has been explained in three ways: in terms of words, knowledge, and meaning (Shabda Samaya, Jnana Samaya, and Artha Samaya). The division of Lok and Alok has also been explained.

There, (1) 'Sam' means the middle ground, that which is not distorted by attachment and aversion, 'Vad' means the group of letters (Akshar), words (Shabda), and sentences (Vakya). The 'Samavad' of the five Astikayas means the middle ground (not distorted by attachment and aversion) text. Oral or scriptural description) that is Shabda Samaya, that is, Shabdaagama is that Shabda Samaya. (2) When the rise of false views is destroyed, the correct understanding of the five Astikayas, that is, correct knowledge, is Jnana Samaya, that is, Jnanaagama is that Jnana Samaya. (3) The Samavaya (group) of the five Astikayas, which has become seven due to the cause of creation, is the Artha Samaya in terms of substance, that is, the group of all substances is that Artha Samaya. In this, they want to explain Artha Samaya in relation to Shabda Samaya for the sake of the fame of Jnana Samaya (Shrimad Bhagavat Kundakundaacharya Dev).

Now, that same Artha Samaya has a duality due to the difference between Lok and Alok. The Lok is as much as the group of the five Astikayas. Beyond that is the immeasurable (Amap) or infinite Alok. That Alok is not just absence, but the space that is infinite in extent, leaving behind the area equal to the group of the five Astikayas. ||3||

**Sanskrit Commentary Verse 3:**

Now, keeping in mind the intention to explain the word "Samaya" in three ways: in terms of words, knowledge, and meaning, and to explain the division of Lok and Alok in the latter half of the verse, this sutra is being said. Similarly, in the future, while explaining the intended and unintended meaning of the sutra, or by deciding that this sutra is appropriate before this sutra, this sutra is being explained. This is the characteristic of Patanika, which should be known everywhere as far as possible.

Sama Tao Panchanham - The Samavaya (group) of the five, starting with Jiva (soul) and ending with Artha (substance). Samaya Minam - This Samaya is what the Jinas have said (Pannavattanjinarai). So Chev Havdi Logo - That is the group of the five, that is the Lok. Tat To - From that, from the Samavaya of the five, starting with Jiva and ending with Artha, Amao - Amito Aparaman (infinite, immeasurable).

---------------------------
The term "Panchaastikaya" or "Amo" refers to the five fundamental entities: Jiva (soul), Pudgala (matter), Dharma (motion), Adharma (rest), and Akasha (space). These entities are not created by anyone, not even by the Lok (world). The term "Alok" or "Aloyakkha" refers to the infinite pure space beyond the Lok. 

The term "Samaya" (time) has three interpretations:

1. **Shabda Samaya (Word Time):** This refers to the textual description of the five entities, including their characteristics and relationships.
2. **Jnana Samaya (Knowledge Time):** This refers to the understanding and realization of the five entities, free from doubt, delusion, and confusion.
3. **Artha Samaya (Meaning Time):** This refers to the actual existence and interaction of the five entities, forming the Lok.

The Lok is defined as the realm where the five entities exist and interact. It is characterized by the presence of Jiva, Pudgala, Dharma, Adharma, and Akasha. The Lok is finite, while the Alok is infinite and pure space beyond the Lok.

## Six Substances - Description of Five Astikayas

The knowledge of the essence of the six substances, which is the object of knowledge, is called 'Artha Samaya'. Here, based on the 'Shabda Samaya', the explanation of 'Artha Samaya' begins to establish the 'Jnana Samaya'. This 'Artha Samaya' is called 'Loka'. It is like this: whatever is perceived by the five senses is called 'Pudgala Astikaya'. Whatever is conscious is called 'Jiva Astikaya'. In the movement of Jiva and Pudgala, 'Dharma' is the cause, and in their state, 'Adharma' is the cause. 'Akasha' is the cause of their perception, and 'Kala' is the cause of their existence. The area where these exist is called 'Loka'. It is said that where Jiva and other substances are perceived, that is 'Loka'. The twelve infinite pure Akashas are called 'A-Loka'. This is the meaning of the Sutra. || 3 ||

## Uththānika - Further Description of Five Astikayas

**Verse 4:**

Here, the specific names of the five Astikayas, their general and specific existence, and their nature as a body are explained. Jiva, Pudgala, Dharma, Adharma, and Akasha. They are always constant, non-dual, and exist in both minute and large forms. || 4 ||

**Explanation:**

Jiva, Pudgala, Dharma, Adharma, and Akasha are their specific names, and their meanings are clear. Their general and specific existence can be understood from their constant nature and their existence in the form of creation, destruction, and change. Although they are constant, they are not non-dual, because they are always self-existent and non-dual. Even though they are non-dual, their constant existence is due to the application of 'Naya'. The Lord has established two 'Nayas': 'Dravyaartha' and 'Paryayaartha'. The teachings are not based on one 'Naya' but on both. Therefore, due to the 'Paryayaartha' teaching, they are considered to be constantly existing, and due to the 'Dravyaartha' teaching, they are considered to be self-existent and non-dual. Their nature as a body is due to their existence in both minute and large forms. The minute particles are the parts of the body, both tangible and intangible, and they are indivisible. The large particles are formed by the accumulation of these minute particles. This proves their nature as a body. The term 'Anu-Mahaanta' (minute and large) is derived from the combination of two minute particles. Even the combination of two minute particles is considered to be a body. The minute and large particles are considered to be the form of individual power. Therefore, even though a single particle is considered to be a single space, it is still considered to be a body. The large particles are not considered to be a body because they are not formed by the accumulation of space, but by the accumulation of power. Therefore, even though 'Kala' (time) is considered to be constantly existing, it is not considered to be a body.

**Verse 4:**

The five Astikayas, beginning with the Jiva, are thus not non-existent even in the case of the Astikaya-prakarana.

**Hindi Commentary:**

**Anvayaartha:** (Jiva) Jiva, (Pudgalakaya) Pudgalakaya, (Dharma-Adharma) Dharma, Adharma, (Tatha Evam) Thus, (Akasham) Akash (Astitve Niyata) are fixed in existence (Ananyamaya) (from existence) are non-different [ ] and (Anu-Mahaanta) are large in the region of the Anu.

**Tika:** Here (in this verse) the special names of the five Astikayas, the general-specific-existence and the karayatva are mentioned.

There, Jiva, Pudgal, Dharma, Adharma and Akash - Graha are their special names, to be known accordingly. They are fixed in the general-specific existence of production-destruction, Dhrauvyamयी, due to their being established in the general-specific existence, it should be ascertained that they also have general-specific existence. Even though they are fixed in existence, they are not different from existence, because their origin is always from non-difference. Even though they are "non-different from existence", their "being fixed in existence" is a Nayaprayoga. Bhagwan has mentioned two Nays - Dravyarthic and Paryayarthic. There, the statement is not subject to one Nay, but to two Nays. Therefore, they are established in existence (fixed) from the Paryayarthic statement, which is somewhat different from itself, and due to being self-existent from the Dravyarthic statement, they are non-different from existence.

**23**

They also have Kayapana, because they are Anu-Mahaanta. Here, Anu means the region, both concrete and abstract, indivisible [smallest] part, 'being great by them (by many regions)' that is Anu-Mahaanta, that is, Pradeshprachayatmak (being a collection of regions) is Anu-Mahaanta. Thus, their (the above five substances) Kayatva is proved. [In the above derivation of Anu-Mahaanta, the plural has been used for Anus, that is, regions, and according to the rules of the Sanskrit language, the dual is not included in the plural, therefore, now, by slightly changing the language in the derivation, the dual-Anuk Skandhas are also shown to be Anu-Mahaanta, proving their Kayatva] 'Being great by two Anus (two regions)' that is Anu-Mahaanta - by such derivation, the dual-Anuk Pudgalaskandhas also have Kayatva (due to being Anu-Mahaanta). [Now, how are the atoms Anu-Mahaanta? By explaining this, the Kayatva of the atoms is also proved] Due to being Anu and Mahaanta in the form of individual and power (that is, the atom being one-region in the form of individual and many-region in the form of power), the atoms also have Kayatva, even though they are one-region in nature (due to the proof of Anu-Mahaanta). Due to the lack of Pradeshprachayatmak Mahaanta in the form of individual and power, the KalAnus, even though they are fixed in existence, still...

---------------------------
The description of the six substances and the five categories of existence is not contradictory. This is proven by the statement itself. Therefore, although they exist, they are not included in the category of existence. ||4||

**Sanskrit Commentary Verse 4**

Now, the specific names of the five categories of existence, their general and specific nature, and their existence as bodies are explained. - The living beings, the particles, the dharma, the adharma, and the space are the specific names of the five categories of existence. They should be understood as being in accordance with their meaning. They are definitely established in their existence, in the general and specific nature of existence. Then, they would be different from each other, like berries in a pot. This is not the case. They are not separate from their own existence, just as the form and other qualities are in a pot, the hands and feet are in the body, and the essence is in the pillar. This explanation shows that even in the relationship of support and supported, there is no destruction of existence. Now, the nature of the body is explained. They are large in terms of particles, because the word "particle" refers to space here, and they are large in terms of particles, because they are made up of many particles. They are large in terms of two particle aggregates, because they are large in terms of two particles. This is the nature of the body. If it is asked, how can there be a body of one space? Then, it is said that the nature of the body is due to the power of smoothness and roughness, which is the cause of the aggregates, and is present in them. The nature of the body is not present in the particles of time, because they do not have the power of smoothness and roughness, which is the cause of bondage. Why is there no power? Because they are immortal. Thus, the specific names of the five categories of existence, their existence, and their nature as bodies have been explained. The meaning of this verse is that the pure living being, which is the body of infinite knowledge, etc., is being explained here. ||4||

**Hindi Commentary Verse 4**

Meaning with Anvaya - (Living beings) infinite living beings (particles) infinite particles, existence [dharma, adharma] one dharma existence, one adharma existence (taheva) similarly (akhand aakash) one undivided space - all these [asthithamhi] in their existence or in their being [niyada] are definite (y) and [anannamahiya] are not separate from their own existence or are one with each other, and [anumahanta] are many in space or are multi-spatial.

Specific Meaning - There are two types of existence - one is general existence or maha-satta, and the other is specific existence or avantara-satta. These five categories of existence, living beings, etc., are situated in both these types of existence. They are not like berries in a pot, which are separate from each other, but they are all one with each other or non-different from their own existence. Just as form, etc., are pervasive in a pot, or hands and feet are in the body, or the essence is in the pillar. This statement shows that even without the support and supported, the oneness of existence is said to be with them. The space is knowable by particles, therefore, the word "particle" should be taken here to mean space. So, all these five substances or categories of existence are larger than their spaces, therefore, they are anumahanta. Two particle aggregates are great because of two particles.

Page #29:
---------------------------
The five Astikayas are said to be Anu-Mahant (minutely great) because they are the basis of the five Astikayas. Therefore, they are called Kayapana (having a body). The Kayapana of a single Pradesh (space) atom is due to the fact that these atoms form Skandhas (aggregates) due to their oily or rough qualities. Therefore, they are Kayapana due to their use or application. Kalaanu (time atoms) do not have the power of oiliness or roughness due to their mutual binding. Therefore, they are not Kayapana even by application. The absence of this power in them is because all Kalaanu are Amurti (formless). In this way, this verse describes the special names of the five Astikayas, their existence, and their Kayapana. This Sutra should be understood to mean that only one pure Jeeva Astikaya is worthy of being accepted. ||4||

**Time Explanation Verse-5**

Here, the possibility of the existence of the five Astikayas and the possibility of their having a body are explained.

Those who have a nature along with qualities and various transformations, they are the Astikayas from which the three worlds are born. ||5||

Indeed, the Astikayas have a nature, a self-nature, and non-duality along with qualities and various transformations. The special features of an object are different from its transformations, while qualities are inherent in it. Therefore, even a single object that is dissolving with one transformation and arising with another, and holding on to its inherent quality, has existence characterized by destruction, creation, and permanence. However, if there is complete duality with qualities and transformations, then one will perish, another will appear, and another will hold on to permanence, and everything will be in flux. Therefore, this is the explanation of the possibility of proper existence. The possibility of having a body is explained by itself.

Because the Jeeva, Pudgala, Dharma, Adharma, and Akasha are not non-existent, their parts, which are called Pradesh (space), are also said to be transformations due to their mutual difference. Their non-duality with these transformations makes the existence of a body possible. Even a single atom, which is without parts, has the power of having parts, so the existence of a body is not refuted. This is not the intention - that the assumption of having parts for those other than Pudgala, who are formless and indivisible, is wrong. It is seen that even in the indivisible space, there is the assumption of division as this is the space of the pot and this is the space outside the pot. If there were no division there, then the space of the pot would be the same as the space outside the pot. This is not desirable. Therefore, the existence of a body, which is the same as having parts, is to be understood for all except Kalaanu.

The fact that they are born in the form of the three worlds is also a means of proving their Astikayatva. Thus, the three worlds, the upper, lower, and middle worlds, are born with the three types of creation and permanence, and they are the special nature of those worlds. Therefore, they prove the existence of their fundamental elements along with the combination of qualities and transformations. It is inferred that Dharma, Adharma, and Akasha have the existence of having parts, which is the same as the transformation in the form of the upper, lower, and middle worlds. Even the Jeevas...

The existence of the six substances and the five astikayas, as described in the form of the division of the three worlds (upper, lower, and middle), is inferred from the fact that they are always present in the state of filling the worlds, due to their inherent power. Similarly, the existence of the pudgalas, which have attained the form of the great skandhas, due to their transformation in the form of the division of the three worlds, is also established by the fact that they are capable of being combined with individual powers, and thus have nine types of parts. ||5||

**Panchaastikaya Prabhrut**

27 (1) The three lokas (worlds) - the upper, lower, and middle - are characterized by their production, consumption, and sustenance, and they exist as the unique forms of these three lokas. As they evolve, they demonstrate the existence of their fundamental substances, along with their qualities and modifications.

(2) Furthermore, it can be inferred that Dharma, Adharma, and Akasha - each of these substances - undergo transformation as divisions of the three lokas (upper, lower, and middle), resulting in their being constituted by parts, known as Kayatva. Similarly, it can be inferred that each Jiva (living being) also undergoes transformation as divisions of the three lokas (upper, lower, and middle), resulting in their being constituted by parts, known as Kayatva, due to the constant presence of the power of individual existence, which manifests as the filling of the lokas.  Likewise, it can be inferred that Pudgala (matter) also undergoes transformation as divisions of the three lokas (upper, lower, and middle), resulting in their being constituted by parts, known as Kayatva, due to the constant presence of the power of individual existence, which manifests as the filling of the lokas.

---------------------------
The description of the six substances and the five categories of existence, as well as their nature, has been explained. How so? Because in the three worlds, whatever substances are subject to origination, destruction, and modification, they are said to have existence in the form of origination, destruction, and modification. How so? Because it is said that existence is in the form of origination, destruction, and modification. Therefore, due to the presence of parts, the nature of being composed of parts, and the nature of having a location, the nature of existence and the nature of body exist in the form of the upper, lower, and middle parts, as the form of the three worlds, which are the result of the transformation of the soul, matter, etc. This nature of existence and the nature of body should be understood not only in the aforementioned way, but also in this way. In this context, the nature of body of the pure soul should be understood as the nature of infinite knowledge, etc., the nature of the perfected state, and the nature of countless locations. This is the meaning. ||5||

Thus, the concise explanation of the five categories of existence, up to the three verses, has been completed. This is the second stage.

**Hindi Meaning:**

Verse 5 of the Uthānika further clarifies how the existence and body mentioned in the first verse are possible.

**General Meaning with Anvaya:**

(Jesiṁ) Those five categories of existence (vivihehiṁ) with various types of (guṇehiṁ pajjayehiṁ saha) qualities and states of being [asthi sahaao] have the nature of existence (te) they [asthikāya] are categories of existence (hoti) are. (Jehiṁ) By which (tiilukkāṁ) these three worlds (ṇippāṇṇāṁ) are created.

**Specific Meaning:**

Here, the nature of existence is called existence, its essence, or its form. They exist with various types of qualities and states of being. Thus, the existence of all five categories has been stated. This is a commentary. Anvayi qualities are those that are inherent, and vyatireka states of being are those that are distinct. Alternatively, those that exist along with the substance are called qualities, and those that exist in a separate sequence are called states of being. These qualities and states of being, while differing in terms of name, characteristics, number, purpose, etc., in relation to their substance, are not different in terms of location or existence; they are non-dual. These qualities and states of being are of various types, such as inherent qualities, manifested qualities, or inherent states of being, manifested states of being, and states of being related to meaning and states of being related to expression.

In relation to the soul, it is said that omniscience, etc., are the inherent qualities of the soul, and knowledge, etc., are the manifested qualities of the soul. The perfected state is the inherent state of being. The forms of humans, hell beings, etc., are the manifested states of being. In relation to matter, it is said that the color, etc., in pure (unbound) atoms are the inherent qualities, and the color, etc., in the aggregates formed by two atoms are the manifested qualities. The state of being in the form of pure atoms is the inherent state of being of the substance. The transformation of pure atoms from one color, etc., to another color, etc., is the manifested quality state of being. The transformation of atoms into aggregates of two atoms, etc., is the...

Page #33:
---------------------------
The five Astikayas, beginning with the Prabhrit Vibhav, are categories of Dravya. The transformation of these categories, from the atomic level to the level of color and other characteristics, is the Vibhav Guna category. These are considered the special qualities of the Jiva and Pudgala. The general qualities are existence, reality, knowability, non-heaviness, etc., which are found in all Dravyas. The special qualities and categories of Dharma and other Dravyas will be discussed later. The five Astikayas exist with these qualities and categories, and thus they are in the form of existence. Now, we discuss Kayapana. Anything that is similar to a body is called Kay, meaning a collection of many regions. The three Lokas are created by these five Astikayas. Any substance in the three Lokas that is produced, consumed, or has a form is indicative of the existence of the Astikayas in the form of production, consumption, and form. This is because the Sutra states, "Utpada Vyaya Dhrauvya Rupa Sat." The Jiva, Pudgala, and other Dravyas are filled in the three Lokas and are responsible for the shape and transformation of the three Lokas. There are three types of Nelaad, Ma, and Bayo. The Jiva, Pudgala, and other five Dravyas have components, parts, or regions. Therefore, Kayapana should be understood in this way, not just as previously mentioned. Time Dravya is one region, so it does not have Kayapana. In this way, existence and Kayatva should be understood. The existence of the infinite knowledge and other qualities of the pure Jiva Astikaya, the existence of its Siddha category, and its Kayapana in the form of countless regions should be understood. ||5||

In this way, the second section is complete, explaining the five Astikayas in three verses. ||3-4-5||

**Verse 6: Explanation of Time**

Here, the Dravya nature of the five Astikayas and Time is stated. These Astikayas are eternal, having undergone transformation in the past, present, and future. They are connected to the Dravya state, along with the sign of transformation. ||6||

These Astikayas are eternal, having undergone transformation in the past, present, and future. ||6||

They are connected to the Dravya state, along with the sign of transformation. ||6||

Dravyas are the foundation for the non-separate qualities and categories of the universe. Therefore, because the past, present, and future states of the Astikayas have undergone transformation in their nature, there is a Dravya nature to the Astikayas, the sign of transformation, and Time. They are not impermanent because they are undergoing transformation in the past, present, and future states, as they are eternal due to their unchanging nature. Here, Time is called the sign of transformation because it is the cause of the transformation of Pudgala and other Dravyas, and because it is the category that is understood through the transformation of Pudgala and other Dravyas, and because it is included within the Astikayas. ||6||

## Chapter 30: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

**Hindi Commentary, Verse 6: Meaning**

(Those who are transformed into states of the three times) Those who are transformed into states of the past, present, and future, and (are eternal) are eternal, (they are the Astikayas) these are the Astikayas, (combined with the changing mark) combined with the changing mark (time), they attain suppression (i.e., they are the six substances).

**Commentary:**

Here, the five Astikayas and time are described as substances.

Substances are fundamentally the basis of co-existing qualities and sequentially existing states. Therefore, the five Astikayas and the changing mark time are substances because they are transformed into states of the past, present, and future.

They are not impermanent because they are transformed into states of the past, present, and future, as they do not abandon their own definite form in these states. Therefore, they are eternal.

Here, time is called the "changing mark" because it is the cause of the change in the Pudgala, etc., and its states are known through the change in the Pudgala, etc.

**Sanskrit Commentary, Verse 6:**

Now, the author describes time and the five Astikayas as substances.

"They are the Astikayas, transformed into states of the three times, and eternal." These five Astikayas, although transformed into states of the three times, are momentary, impermanent, and perishable according to the conventional view. However, they are eternal according to the substantial view. Thus, they are both eternal and impermanent according to the substantial and conventional views. They attain the "state of substance" (i.e., they are recognized as substances).

Again, what are they like? "Combined with the changing mark." The change itself, the transformation of the Jiva, Pudgala, etc., is the mark, the sign, the cause, the indicator, the indication, of which it is. This is the changing mark, the time atom, the substantial time. They are combined with it.

Now, it should be said that they are combined with the substantial time. Why is it said that they are combined with the changing mark? It is not so. In the context of the five Astikayas, time is not the main thing. It is known as the mark of the action, as the form of the new and old states of the objects. Therefore, it is called the changing mark.

Here, among the six substances, the pure Jiva Astikaya, which is free from all thoughts and doubts arising from the perception of objects, such as food, fear, sex, and possession, and is filled with the three jewels of faith, knowledge, and conduct, is the object of attainment. It is attainable through the knowledge of self-awareness, which is the form of supreme bliss, innate, and prior, arising from the state of non-dualistic samadhi. This is the meaning.

Thus, the verse describes the five Astikayas, along with time, as substances.

Page #35:
---------------------------
(These are) the five Astikayas mentioned above (Astikaya) which are the transformations of the five substances (Pariyattanalinga-sanjukta) with the sign of transformation, which (Tekaliyabhavaparinda) transform into three-time related synonyms with time, and (Niccha) remain imperishable (Daviyabhavan) in their substance (Gachchanti) are attained.

**Special Meaning:** According to the Paryayarthika Naya, these five Astikayas mentioned above are transformed by the three-time synonyms, and are momentary, impermanent, and perishable. However, according to the Dravyarthika Naya, they are eternal. Thus, they are Nistanayamika from the Dravyarthika and Paryayarthika perspectives. Just as smoke is a sign of fire, similarly, the transformation or change of the Jiva, Pudgala, etc. substances is the sign, Gamak, Gnyak, and indicator of the Kala Dravya. That is, any cause that is the cause of the change of substances is the transformation sign, Kalana, or Drashyakala.

Here, someone may doubt why it is not said "Kaladravyasanjukta" but rather "Parivartanalingsanjukta" which is an unclear statement. The solution is that Kala is not the main focus in the context of the five Astikayas. Because the old and new nature of substances occurs, Kala is known through this transformation-like work sign. Therefore, it is said "Parivartanalinga" to inform about this.

Among these six substances, the pure Jiva Astikaya, which is free from the thoughts and doubts arising from the desire-like dependence on all other substances, such as seeing, hearing, experiencing, eating, fear, sexual intercourse, and possession, is the one that is worthy of being grasped and experienced. It is the Jiva Dravya that is obtained within one's own body through pure conviction, which is full of the pure, eternal, and effortless supreme bliss that arises from the Samadhi or equanimity, which is free from doubts, and which is the three-jewel-like, non-dual, Shraddha, Gnyan, and Acharan.

Thus, the verse is complete by stating that the five Astikayas, including Kala, are called Dravyas.

**Uttanika:** Further, it is said that these six substances, while being in close contact with each other, do not fall from their own nature.

**Samayavyakhya Gatha-7:** Here, it is said that even though the six substances are in close contact with each other, they do not deviate from their own nature.

The six substances (षड्द्रव्य) - the five astikāyas (पंचास्तिकाय) - enter into one another, giving space (अवकाश) to one another. Though they are always (नित्यं) united, they do not abandon (न विजहन्ति) their own (स्वकं) nature (स्वभावं).

The commentary explains that even though the six substances are extremely intermingled, they do not deviate from their respective definite natures. Therefore, it was said earlier (in the 6th verse) that they are eternal (नित्य) despite being transformable (परिणामवत्त्वे). And therefore, they do not attain oneness (एकत्वापत्ति), and even though the soul (जीव) and karma are spoken of as one from the perspective of the practical viewpoint (व्यवहारनय), they do not accept each other's nature.

Page #37:
---------------------------
The meaning is that the pure soul substance, known as the *Shuddha Jiva Astikaya*, within one's own body, is the only thing that is worthy of being attained, starting from the five *Astikayas* and ending with the *Nischayana*.  

However, the meditation practices of other extreme proponents, which involve holding the breath, achieving a state of complete emptiness, or practicing *Akasa Dhyana* (meditation on space), all of which are accompanied by attachment, aversion, and delusion, are all meaningless.

The difference between *Sankalpa* and *Vikalpa* is explained as follows: *Sankalpa* is the transformation that arises in the external object, which is a mixture of consciousness and non-consciousness, such as the thought "This is mine." *Vikalpa* is the transformation that arises within, such as the feeling of happiness or sorrow, like "I am happy" or "I am sad." This is the definition of *Sankalpa* and *Vikalpa*.

It is said that the qualifier "free from attachment" is meaningless in the state of *Vitaraaga Nirvikalpa Samadhi* (meditation free from attachment and mental fluctuations). To address this, it is explained that the qualifier "free from attachment" is necessary to avoid the practice of *Ashubha Dhyana* (meditation on inauspicious things), which is caused by the *Kashaya* (negative emotions) related to anger and cruelty. It is also necessary because it explains the relationship between cause and effect, because it is a *Karmadharaya* compound, because it avoids repetition, because it is a qualifier of the essence, and because it strengthens the understanding. This should be understood throughout the explanation of *Vitaraaga Nirvikalpa Samadhi*.

Similarly, when explaining terms like *Vitaraaga*, *Sarvajña* (omniscient), *Nirdosha* (free from faults), and *Parmatma* (Supreme Soul), the same approach should be taken to address any objections that may arise.

The meaning of the phrase "cause and effect" is that because of the cause, *Vitaraaga* (freedom from attachment), there is the effect, *Nirvikalpa Samadhi* (meditation free from mental fluctuations). || 7 ||

By avoiding the faults of *Sankara* (mixture) and *Vyatikrama* (contradiction), the *Gatha* (verse) has reached the third stage, and with these two independent *Gathas*, the third stage has been reached. Thus, the first *Maha Adhikara* (major chapter) is complete with seven *Gathas* and three stages, establishing the meaning of the word *Samaya* (time) and the introduction to the *Peethika* (preface).

The first *Antara Adhikara* (minor chapter) is complete.

Now, starting with the *Gatha* "**Ath Satta Sanchapayattha**," the *Peethika* (preface) on general substances is explained in fourteen *Gathas*, excluding the substances like *Jiva* (soul) and *Pudgala* (matter).

Within these fourteen *Gathas*, the first *Gatha* "**Satta Savvapayattha**" explains the characteristics of general and specific existence. The second *Gatha* "**Daviyadi**" explains the non-difference between existence and substance, and the etymology of the word *Dravya* (substance). The third *Gatha* "**Dhavva Salakkhaniiyam**" explains the three characteristics of substance. The fourth *Gatha* "**Uppatti Vi Naaso**" explains the two characteristics of substance. The fifth and sixth *Gathas* "**Pajjayarahiayam**" explain the third characteristic of substance.

Thus, with these three *Gathas*, the fourth stage is reached, primarily focusing on the justification of the *Dravya Arthic* (substance-based) and *Paryaya Arthic* (category-based) perspectives, and their mutual relationship.

The fifth stage, with the *Gatha* "**Siyaatthi**," primarily focuses on refuting all extreme views and explaining the seven types of evidence.

Thus, with these five stages within the fourteen *Gathas*, the first seven *Gathas* are complete.

The second set of seven *Gathas* begins with the *Gatha* "**Bhavasa Natthi Naaso**," which primarily focuses on establishing the existence of substance by refuting the extreme views of Buddhism. This is followed by four *Gathas* that explain this *Gatha*. Within these four *Gathas*, the *Gatha* "**Bhaava Jivaadia**" primarily explains the substance and its categories. The *Gatha* "**Manuaattana**" explains that even though the categories like humans are subject to destruction and creation, they are still permanent and do not cease to exist. The *Gatha* "**So Cheva**" further strengthens this point. The *Gatha* "**Evam Sado Vinaaso**" concludes the explanation by stating that according to the *Dravya Arthic* perspective, destruction and creation do not occur for the real, while according to the *Paryaya Arthic* perspective, they occur through rebirth. Thus, these four *Gathas* together constitute the second stage.

The third stage, with the *Gatha* "**Naanavarandia**," primarily focuses on the creation of the unreal from the real, according to the *Paryaya Arthic* perspective.

The fourth stage, with the *Gatha* "**Evam Bhavam**," primarily focuses on explaining the creation and destruction of the categories like godhood for the soul in the cycle of existence, even though the soul is eternal in its substance, according to the *Paryaya Arthic* perspective. This concludes the *Dravya Peethika* (preface on substance).

Page #38:
---------------------------
The **Six Substances and Five Astikayas** chapter, along with other chapters, completes the second set of seven chapters. Thus, with fourteen chapters and other sections, the **Dravya Peethika** (Substance Foundation) is complete. 

The text explains the nature of existence. It begins by defining the essence of existence and then proceeds to explain the substances. The text states that the essence of existence is **Bhaantva** (beingness) and then explains the substances.

**Verse 7** (with commentary)

**Anvaya** (Word Order):  **Anno Upanam Pavisantam** (entering another field) **Annam Annas** (one another) **Ogasan** (giving space) **Niccam Milantam Vi Ya** (always meeting) **Sag Sambhav** (with their own nature) **Pa Vijahanti** (do not abandon).

**General Meaning:** When entering another field, they (the six substances) give space to one another, always meeting, yet they do not abandon their own nature.

**Specific Meaning:** The six substances give space to each other and remain in their own state until their time. However, there is no mixing or interference between them. Mixing is when two substances become one, and interference is when one substance enters another, like the qualities of a **Jiva** (soul) entering **Pudgala** (matter).

The phrase "entering one another" refers to the movement of **Jivas** and **Pudgalas**, which are active substances. The phrase "giving space" refers to the interaction of active substances like **Jivas** and **Pudgalas** with inactive substances like **Dharma** (merit), **Adharma** (demerit), **Akasha** (space), and **Kala** (time). The phrase "always meeting" refers to the constant interaction of inactive substances like **Dharma**, **Adharma**, **Akasha**, and **Kala**.

The text then discusses the **Six Substances** and their interactions. It mentions the three **Ashubha Leshya** (inauspicious colors) - **Krishna** (black), **Neela** (blue), and **Kapota** (grey) - which are perceived through the senses and are associated with the **Six Substances**. These colors are the result of the **Sankalpa-Vikalpa** (thought-waves) arising from the interaction of the **Six Substances**. The text then describes the **Param Anand** (supreme bliss) that arises from **Vitaraga Nirvikalpa Samadhi** (a state of complete detachment and non-dualistic meditation). This bliss is the result of the **Shuddha Dravya Arthika Nay** (pure substance-based logic) and is the **Shuddha Jiva Astikaya** (pure soul-body).

The text then criticizes the **Ekantvadi** (isolationists) who practice **Shunya Dhyana** (meditation on emptiness) or **Akasha Dhyana** (meditation on space). These practices are considered futile because they are based on **Raga** (attachment), **Dvesha** (aversion), and **Moha** (delusion).

The text then explains the difference between **Sankalpa** and **Vikalpa**. **Sankalpa** is the thought that "this is mine," which arises from the interaction of the external world with the **Jiva**. **Vikalpa** is the thought that "I am happy or unhappy," which arises from the internal state of the **Jiva**.

---------------------------
One should know the characteristics of sankalpa-vikalpaka, which are like the five astikayas. Here, if someone says that the epithet "vitraga" is meaningless in "vitraga nirvikalpa samadhi," then we provide the following solution: the epithet "vitraga" is not meaningless for the following reasons. Firstly, it indicates that the subject matter of the "art" or "raudradhyana" type, which are inauspicious meditations due to the kshayas, is prohibited here. Secondly, it states the cause and the effect of the cause. Thirdly, it is a karmadharaya compound. Fourthly, it does not count as a repetition fault in the "bhavana" text. Fifthly, it is an epithet of the form. Sixthly, it is intended to strengthen. Wherever there is an explanation of "vitraga nirvikalpa samadhi," one should know this meaning in all places. If words like "vitraga sarvajña nirdosha paramatma" are used in the same way, and someone raises a similar objection, then it is appropriate to resolve it in the same way. The meaning of "hetuhetumad bhaava" is that the same reason that makes one "vitraga" is also the reason for "nirvikalpa samadhi."

In this way, the "sankara vyatikar" fault is removed, and the gatha is complete. In this way, the third sthala is complete with two independent gathas. In this way, the first mahaadhikār is complete with seven gathas and three sthalas, which constitute the preface to the meaning of the word "samaya."

Further, starting with the gatha "satta savvapyattha," and continuing up to fourteen gathas, a preface to the general dravya is given, without discussing the specific dravyas like jiva, pudgala, etc. In these fourteen gathas, the characteristics of general and specific sattva are explained. The gatha sutra in the first sthala is "satta savyapyatha," etc. Then, the non-duality of sattva and dravya, and the importance of the word "dravya" are explained in the second sthala with the sutra "daviyadi," etc. Then, the three characteristics of dravya are explained in the third sthala with the sutra "davvam sallakhaniyam," etc. Then, two characteristics are explained with the sutra "uppattiya vinaso," etc. Then, the third characteristic is explained with the gathas "pajjaya rahiya," etc. In this way, the fourth sthala is constituted by three gathas, which are a collection of dravya-arthic, paryayarthic, and mutually dependent, and which support both nayas. In the fifth sthala, the sutra "siya atthi," etc. is used to explain the seven-fold negation, which is the main proof for refuting all one-sided views. In this way, the first seven gathas are constituted by five sthalas in fourteen gathas. Then, in the second set of seven gathas, the first sthala is constituted by the gatha sutra "bhavasa natthi naso," etc., which is used to refute the one-sided view of Buddhism and establish the dravya. Then, there are four gathas to elaborate on this. In these four gathas, the gatha sutra of the same adhikār is used to explain the dravya-guna-paryaya, with the sutra "bhaava jivaadiya," etc.

Page #40:
---------------------------
The "Shaddravya-Panchaastikaya-Varnana Sutra" is one. Then, there is another Sutra, "Manuanatena", which states that even though there is destruction and birth in the cycle of human beings and other beings, there is no destruction in terms of the eternal. Then, to further solidify this, there is another Sutra, "So Cheva". In this way, according to the Dravyarthika Naya, there is no destruction of the real and no creation of the unreal, but according to the Paryayarthika Naya, there is. In this way, the concluding verse, "Javan Sado Vinaso", etc., summarizes the explanation of these two Nayas. In this way, there are four verses in the second section. Then, in the third section, there is one Sutra, "Nanavaranadya", which emphasizes that according to the Paryayarthika Naya, there is creation of the unreal for the Siddhas. Further, in the fourth section, there is one verse, "Evam Bhavam", etc., which summarizes the explanation that even though the Dravya is eternal, according to the Paryayarthika Naya, the birth and death of the worldly beings, such as becoming a god, are due to the actions of the being. This verse also marks the end of the section on Dravya. In this way, there are seven sections in the second part, which consists of four sections. Thus, the explanation of Dravya is complete with fourteen verses and nine sections. This is described in the following verse:

**Time Explanation Verse 8:**

"Atratisthvasvarupamuktam. Sattaa Savva-Payattha Saviss-Ruuva Anant-Pajjayaa. Bhanguppaada-Dhuvattaa Sappaddivakkha Havdi Ekkaa."

**Translation:**

"The essence of existence is explained here. Existence is all-pervading, with infinite forms and infinite transformations. It is characterized by destruction, creation, and permanence, and it is one with its opposite."

**Explanation:**

"Existence, also known as Sattaa, is the state of being. It is not something that is eternally constant or completely momentary. A truly eternal thing cannot have transformations, as there would be no change in its state. A truly momentary thing cannot have continuity, as there would be no way to recognize it. Therefore, existence is something that is characterized by permanence, based on a certain form, and it is constantly changing and being created, with two forms, one of which is disappearing and the other is appearing. It is simultaneously experiencing all states of existence in reality. Therefore, existence is also characterized by creation, destruction, and permanence, as it is the same as the state of being and non-being. It is one, as it is the indicator of the similarity of all other things. It is present in all things, as the concept of "Sat" (existence) is found in all things. It is all-encompassing, as it exists with all the forms and characteristics of the universe. It is infinite in its transformations, as it is understood through infinite transformations of Dravya. Even though it is like this, it is not uncontrolled."

Page #41:
---------------------------
The five characteristics, beginning with the characteristic of being subject to origination, destruction, and permanence, are all characterized by having an opposite. The opposite of existence is non-existence, the opposite of the three characteristics is the absence of the three characteristics, the opposite of the one is the many, the opposite of being present in all substances is being present in one substance, the opposite of being of one form is being of many forms, and the opposite of being of one category is being of infinite categories. There are two types of existence: the great existence and the limited existence. The great existence is the indicator of the existence of similarity that pervades all substances. The limited existence is the indicator of the existence of the form that is limited to a specific substance. Thus, the great existence is non-existence in the form of limited existence, and the limited existence is non-existence in the form of great existence. Therefore, non-existence is existence. The characteristic of origination is the characteristic of being one, the characteristic of destruction is the characteristic of being one, and the characteristic of permanence is the characteristic of being one. Therefore, the absence of the three characteristics in the forms of things that are originating, being destroyed, and remaining is the absence of the three characteristics in the three characteristics. The existence of the form of one thing is not the existence of the form of another thing, therefore the one is many. The existence of things is limited to specific substances, therefore the existence of all substances is the existence of one substance. The existence of things is limited to specific forms, therefore the existence of many forms is the existence of one form. The existence of things is limited to specific categories, therefore the existence of infinite categories is the existence of one category. All this is due to the fact that the explanation of the characteristics of the general and the specific is dependent on the two-fold nature of the explanation.

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

The attainment of knowledge of 'being' (sat) is like the attainment of knowledge of 'thatness'. And that (being) is 'all-world-formed' because it exists with all world-forms, i.e., with the unique natures of all the expanse of things. And that (being) is 'infinite-category-formed' because it is pervaded by infinite categories of substances with three characteristics. (Thus, the description of general-particular being has been given in relation to its general aspect, i.e., in relation to the form of great being.)

Even though it is like this, it is not truly unopposed but is opposed. (1) Being is opposed by non-being, (2) the three characteristics are opposed by the non-three-characteristic nature, (3) the one is opposed by the many, (4) the all-substance-located is opposed by the one-substance-located nature, (5) the all-world-formed is opposed by the one-formed nature, (6) the infinite-category-formed is opposed by the one-category-formed nature.

(The above-mentioned opposed nature is explained clearly:-) Being is of two types - great being and intermediate being. Among them, the great being (general being), which indicates the existence of similarity in the group of all substances, has already been mentioned. The other is the intermediate being (particular being), which indicates the nature-existence in a definite (one-one definite) thing. (9) There, great being is non-being in the form of intermediate being, and intermediate being is non-being in the form of great being, therefore being is non-being (i.e., the general-particular being, being 'being' due to being in the form of great being, is also 'non-being' due to being in the form of intermediate being). (2) The production of that (that nature) in that way is one characteristic, the destruction of that (that nature) in that way is one characteristic, and the permanence of that (that nature) in that way is one characteristic, therefore each of the natures of a thing that is produced, destroyed, and permanent is devoid of the three characteristics, therefore the three-characteristic (being) is non-characteristic (i.e., the general-particular being, being 'three-characteristic' due to being in the form of great being, is also 'non-three-characteristic' due to being in the form of intermediate being mentioned here). (3) The nature-being of one thing is not the nature-being of another thing, therefore the one (being) is many (i.e., the general-particular being, being 'one' due to being in the form of great being, is also 'many' due to being in the form of intermediate being mentioned here). (4) The definiteness (different definite individuality) of substances is due to the beings located in definite (individual definite) substances, therefore the all-substance-located (being) is one-substance-located (i.e., the general-particular being, being 'all-substance-located' due to being in the form of great being, is also 'one-substance-located' due to being in the form of intermediate being mentioned here). (5) The definite one-one form of things is due to the beings with definite one-one forms, therefore the all-world-formed (being) is one-formed (i.e., the general-particular being, being 'all-world-formed' due to being in the form of great being, is also 'one-formed' due to being in the form of intermediate being mentioned here).

Page #43:
---------------------------
"The five-fold characteristics, beginning with 'pribhrit', are also 'ekarupa'. (5) The infinity of each category is determined by the (individual, different) entities existing in each category, therefore the infinite-category-possessing (entity) is also one-category-possessing (i.e., the general-specific-most entity, being the form of the great entity, is 'infinite-category-possessing', while the same entity, being the form of the intermediate entity, is also 'one-category-possessing'). Thus, everything is nirvan (i.e., the above-mentioned all-encompassing form is flawless, unobstructed, and free from any contradiction), because its (the form of the entity) statement is subject to two nayas, leaning towards the representation of the general and the specific." (8)

---------------------------
## Chapter 40: Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

This chapter will discuss the six substances and five astikayas, which are:

* **Diverse in form:** They possess numerous forms.
* **Infinite in permutations:** They have infinite permutations.
* **Subject to production, destruction, and permanence:** They are characterized by production, destruction, and permanence.
* **One:** They are one, meaning they are one in relation to the Maha-satta (supreme reality).
* **With their opposites:** They exist along with their opposites.

**Explanation:**

The reality, which is characterized by five specific qualities, possesses its opposite aspects. This means that the reality, which is considered one in relation to the four categories of substance (dravya, guna, karma, and dharma), has its opposite in the form of non-existence in relation to the four categories of substance.

The Maha-satta, which resides in all substances, has its opposite in the form of the Avanta-satta (subordinate reality), which resides in a single substance. The Maha-satta manifests in various forms, such as a pot made of clay, a pot made of gold, a pot made of copper, etc. Its opposite is the Avanta-satta, which is the form of a single pot.

Alternatively, the reality, which exists in a single pot in the form of various qualities like color, smell, taste, touch, etc., has its opposite in the form of a specific quality like smell.

The Maha-satta, which is infinite in permutations in relation to the three times (past, present, and future), has its opposite in the form of the reality of a specific permutation.

The reality, which is characterized by three qualities (production, destruction, and permanence), has its opposite in the form of the reality of a specific production, destruction, or permanence.

The Maha-satta has its opposite in the form of the Avanta-satta.

Therefore, from the perspective of the pure Sangraha-naya (doctrine of collection), there is one Maha-satta. From the perspective of the impure Sangraha-naya or the Vyavahara-naya (doctrine of practical application), there is the Avanta-satta, which exists in all substances in various forms.

This explanation of the opposites should be understood from the perspective of the Naigama-naya (doctrine of negation).

Therefore, the explanation of reality should be understood through the three doctrines of Sangraha, Vyavahara, and Naigama.

Alternatively, it is appropriate to explain reality through two doctrines: the pure Sangraha-naya, which states that there is one Maha-satta, and the Vyavahara-naya, which states that there is the Avanta-satta, which exists in all substances.

Here, the pure reality of the pure Jiva-astikaya (soul-reality) is the object of knowledge or the reality that should be grasped.

**Time Explanation:**

Here, the difference in meaning between reality and substance is rejected.

"That which flows, moves, and pervades those permutations of existence, that is substance. They say that substance is non-different from reality."

Substance is explained as that which flows, moves, and pervades those permutations of existence, which are the permutations of existence that are both sequential and simultaneous, in accordance with the specific nature of reality. Substance is the object of knowledge and its characteristics...

Page #45:
---------------------------
It is to be understood that although there may be some difference between the five characteristics and the other aspects of existence, in reality, they are not separate from existence. Therefore, whatever was previously stated about existence, such as its being, non-being, distinctness, non-distinctness, oneness, multiplicity, being present in all substances, being present in one substance, being the form of the universe, being of one form, having infinite synonyms, and having one synonym, should all be considered as belonging to the substance that follows it. Therefore, there is no specific characteristic of existence that would establish existence as truly separate from substance.

Page #46:
---------------------------
The meaning of the sutra is that since the six substances and the five categories of existence are inseparable, the substance itself should be considered. ||9|| Thus, in the second place, the verse has been stated to remove the doubt regarding the non-difference of substance and existence, the word "substance", and its etymology.
Hindi meaning commentary verse-9 General meaning-(That) which (Tai Tai) its own (Swabhavpjjaayi) nature-like synonyms (Daviyadi) absorbs (Gachchadi) obtains (Tan) that (Daviyam) substance (Bhapante) is called (Tu) but that substance (Sattado) from existence (Ananabhudam) is inseparable.
Specific meaning-That which has undergone transformation in the past, is undergoing transformation in the present, and will undergo transformation in the future, is called substance. With respect to the synonyms of nature, it is said to be "Dravati" and with respect to the synonyms of "Vibhav", it is said to be "Gachchati". This substance is undoubtedly one with its existence, because even though there is a difference between existence and substance with respect to designation, number, characteristics, purpose, etc., there is undoubtedly no difference between existence and substance. Therefore, the characteristics of existence mentioned in the previous verse should also be known as the characteristics of substance, which is inseparable from existence. That is, in substance, there is the presence of all things, the presence of one thing, the presence of all forms, the presence of one form, the presence of infinite synonyms, the presence of one synonym, the presence of three characteristics, the presence of one characteristic, the presence of one form, the presence of many forms. ||9||
In this way, the verse is complete, stating the non-difference of existence and substance and the etymology of the word "substance" in the second place.
Time explanation verse-1
Here, the characteristics of substance are stated. "Davyam Sallakhanayam Uppaadabvaya-Dhuvatta-Sanjuttam. Guna-Pajjaayasayam Va Jam Tan Bhannamti Savvanhu." ||10||
Substance is characterized by being produced, destroyed, and permanent.
Or, whatever is the basis of the synonyms of qualities, that is what the omniscient ones call substance. ||10|| Characteristics of substance. Due to the non-difference of the stated characteristics from existence, the characteristics of substance are the same as the characteristics of existence. And, since substance is multi-faceted, its essence is only existence, because there is no division of object and characteristics. Or, the characteristics of substance are production, destruction, and permanence. In a series of beings that are not contradictory in nature and are sequential, the destruction of the previous being is...

Page #47:
---------------------------
The characteristics of a substance are: (1) **Sat** (existence), (2) **Utpada-Vyaya-Dhrauvyam** (production, destruction, and permanence), and (3) **Guna-Paryaya** (qualities and synonyms).

**Sat** is the characteristic of a substance that is characterized by existence. It is the essence of a substance, which is inseparable from its existence.

**Utpada-Vyaya-Dhrauvyam** is the characteristic of a substance that is characterized by production, destruction, and permanence. It is the process of change that a substance undergoes, where the previous state is destroyed and a new state is produced. This process is continuous and inherent to the substance.

**Guna-Paryaya** is the characteristic of a substance that is characterized by qualities and synonyms. These qualities and synonyms are inherent to the substance and are manifested in different ways. They are both similar and different from the substance, and they are constantly changing.

These three characteristics are interconnected and inseparable. If one is present, the other two are also present. They all describe the essence of a substance and its inherent nature.

Page #48:
---------------------------
## Six Substances - Description of the Five Astikayas

When one of these three characteristics of a substance is stated, the other two are implied by meaning. If a substance is real, then it will be (1) subject to production and destruction, and (2) have qualities and transformations. If it is subject to production and destruction, then it will be (1) real and (2) have qualities and transformations. If it has qualities and transformations, then it will be (1) real and (2) subject to production and destruction. 

In this way, being real, eternal and non-eternal in nature, it (1) manifests the characteristic of being subject to production and destruction, and (2) shows unity with qualities that are subject to production and destruction and transformations that are subject to production and destruction. 

The characteristic of being subject to production and destruction (1) indicates the ultimate reality of being eternal and non-eternal, and (2) reveals the qualities and transformations that are the cause of its nature. 

Qualities and transformations, being both inherent and non-inherent, (1) indicate the characteristic of being subject to production and destruction, and (2) reveal the ultimate reality of being eternal and non-eternal. || 10 ||

General meaning with Anvaya of Panchastikaya: (j) That which is (sallavakhanyam) of good characteristics, (uppaadavvyadhuvattasanjuttam) is accompanied by production, destruction, and change, (va) or (gunapajjaayasayam) is the basis of qualities and synonyms, (tam) that, i.e., the one with the aforementioned three characteristics, (savanhnu) the omniscient Lord [davvam] substance (bhananti) is called.
Specific meaning: The characteristic of substance is done by the sat-rupa dravyarthicnaya. This negates Buddhism which considers all things as non-existent. The characteristic is done by the paryayaarthicnaya as production, destruction, change, or qualities and synonyms. This negates the Sankhya and Nyaya who believe in the eternal and unchanging. By saying that the characteristic of existence is substance, the characteristics of production, destruction, change, or qualities and synonyms are obtained by rule. By characterizing as production, destruction, and change, the characteristic of existence or qualities and synonyms are obtained by rule. By characterizing as qualities and synonyms, the characteristic of production, destruction, change, or existence is obtained by rule. How are the other two characteristics obtained when one characteristic is stated? The answer is that there is mutual inseparability in these three characteristics, i.e., they are all implicit in each other. The meaning here is that pure jiva-dravya is upadaya, which has the characteristic of pure existence, because it does not have mithyatva, raga, dvesha, etc. The same, from the perspective of synonyms, has the characteristic of pure production, destruction, and change due to the six qualities of aguru, laghu, etc., which increase and decrease, and the characteristic of synonyms in the form of infinite qualities like akrutrima jnana, etc., and inherent happiness and perfect siddha. The pure jiva-astikaya is the one that possesses these three characteristics. This explanation refutes the Buddhist view of momentary monism, the Sankhya view of eternal monism, and the Nyaya and Mimamsa view of both eternal and non-eternal monism. The same should be known at the time of explaining other views everywhere. Why do we criticize the momentary monism? The answer to this question is that the one who started the action of creating a pot, etc., was destroyed at that very moment, then the action of the pot could not be completed, etc. Similarly, in believing in eternal monism, there is this flaw that the one who is sitting should remain sitting, the one who is happy should remain happy, the one who is unhappy should remain unhappy, etc. Since the eternally unchanging substance is engraved, there will be no other synonyms in it. Similarly, by believing in the monism of both substance and synonyms without mutual dependence, both the aforementioned flaws will be obtained. In Jainism, by believing in the mutual dependence of substance and synonyms, no flaw can arise. 10.
In this way, the gatha is completed mainly by the information that the characteristic of substance in the third sthala is of three types: existence, etc.

## Chapter 46: Description of the Six Categories and Five Astikayas

**Verse 11:**

**Time Commentary:**

Neither the origin nor the destruction of a substance exists, its existence is real. Its transformations bring about its disappearance, origination, and permanence.

**Commentary:**

Here, the characteristics of a substance are explained through both the substance-oriented and transformation-oriented perspectives.

A substance, which is characterized by the co-existence of qualities and the sequential transformations, and which exists in all three times (past, present, and future), being eternal and without beginning or end, cannot be subject to destruction or creation. However, some of its transformations, which are co-existent, may be permanent, while others, which are sequential, may be subject to destruction and creation. Therefore, when considering a substance in its own right, it should be understood as being without origination and destruction, and having an inherent nature of existence. However, when considering it in terms of its transformations, it should be understood as having origination and destruction.

All this is free from contradiction because there is no difference between a substance and its transformations.

8. They [the Jain scriptures] declare that the five Astikayas [categories of existence] are the result of [the interaction of] the same [underlying] substance, and they [the scriptures] make the production and destruction of that substance permanent. Who are the agents [of this process]? The [different] states [of existence]. What is being said by this? That according to the Dravyarthika Nay [the perspective of substance], the production and destruction of the substance itself do not occur, but according to the Paryayarthika Nay [the perspective of states], they do. What is the example [of this]? In the case of gold, milk, clay, a child, a young man, an adult, and an old man, there is a threefold change [in their form], and by this, the previous statement [in the scriptures] that the eternal and absolute [nature of the soul] is not negated is confirmed. In this sutra, according to the pure Dravyarthika Nay, the pure Jiva Astikaya, which is free from the production and destruction of the states of existence like humans, hell beings, etc., is the object of study, because according to the Paryayarthika Nay, it is possible to attain the state of Vitaraga Nirvikalpa Samadhi [the state of complete detachment and equanimity], which is characterized by the enjoyment of the inherent supreme bliss, and this is the state of the pure Jiva substance, which is characterized by the knowledge of self-awareness. 11. Thus, the sutra is explained by the two-fold explanation of the Dravyarthika and Paryayarthika Nays.

Hindi, Tatparya Vritti, Gatha 11, Uththānika: The first half of the Gatha explains the characteristics of substance according to the Dravyarthika Nay, and the second half explains the characteristics of states according to the Paryayarthika Nay.

Anvaya Sahait Samaanyarth: The substance does not have birth or death, but its mere existence is [always] present. The same states [of existence] cause the production, destruction, and permanence [of the substance].

Vishesharth: The substance is without beginning and end. According to the Dravyarthika Nay, there is no production or destruction of the substance. It always remains in its own existence. By saying this, the absolute view that the substance is momentary is refuted. The production, destruction, and permanence of the states occur according to the Paryayarthika Nay. There are many examples of this. For example, gold is a substance. When earrings are made from it, the earrings are produced, the previous state of the gold is destroyed, and the general qualities of gold remain permanent. Milk is a substance. When cream is made from it, the cream is produced, the thin milk is destroyed, and the general qualities of milk remain permanent. Clay is a substance. When a pot is made from it, the previous state of the pot is destroyed, and the clay remains permanent in all states. A man is a person. He becomes a child, then a young man, then an adult, and then an old man. When the next state is produced, the previous state is destroyed, but the man remains permanent. By this, the absolute view that the soul is eternal is confirmed. In this sutra, the pure Jiva substance, which is free from the production and destruction of the states of existence like humans, hell beings, etc., according to the pure Dravyarthika Nay, is the object of study, because according to the Paryayarthika Nay, it is possible to attain the state of Vitaraga Nirvikalpa Samadhi, which is characterized by the enjoyment of the inherent supreme bliss, and this is the state of the pure Jiva substance, which is characterized by the knowledge of self-awareness. This is the meaning of the sutra.

## Verse 48: Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

This verse concludes the explanation of the characteristics of substance, considering both the Dravyarthic and Paryayarthic Nayas.

**Verse 12:**

* **Translation:**  "A substance without its attributes does not exist, just as there is no milk without its attributes like curd, butter, etc. Similarly, attributes without their substance do not exist, just as there is no curd, butter, etc. without milk. The Shramanas [Jain monks] declare that both are non-different in essence."

* **Commentary:** This verse highlights the non-duality of substance and its attributes. Just as milk cannot exist without its attributes like curd, butter, etc., and vice versa, a substance cannot exist without its attributes, and attributes cannot exist without their substance. Although there may be a perceived difference due to different perspectives or purposes, their essential nature is non-dual.

* **Hindi Commentary:**  The verse explains that a substance without its attributes does not exist, and attributes without their substance do not exist. The Shramanas declare that both are non-different in essence.

* **Sanskrit Commentary:** This verse demonstrates the non-duality of substance and its attributes. A substance without its attributes does not exist, just as there is no milk without its attributes like curd, butter, etc. Similarly, attributes without their substance do not exist, just as there is no curd, butter, etc. without milk. Because of this non-duality, the Shramanas declare that both substance and attributes are non-different in essence.

Page #53:
---------------------------
## The Second Discourse: The Non-Dual, Indivisible Nature of Substance and Attributes

The Shramanas (Jain monks) elucidate the non-dual, indivisible nature of substance and attributes, which is the essence of the matter. If one asks how attributes can be called substances, then the answer is that attributes are synonymous with substance, as it is said, "Attributes are the essence of substance." 

Here, the meaning is that the pure substance, known as the "Shuddha Jiva Astikaya," is indivisible from the pure attributes, and it is the object of pure knowledge. 

In any sentence where the word "naya" (principle) is not explicitly mentioned, it should be understood implicitly. This is similar to how the presence of a verb implies the presence of a noun, or how the word "syat" (perhaps) is understood even when not explicitly stated. 

**Hindi Commentary:**

This verse further explains that according to the "Nischya Naya" (principle of certainty), substance and attributes are inseparable. 

**Meaning with Analysis:**

* **Substance without attributes, and attributes without substance, do not exist.** The Shramanas say that both are non-dual, indivisible, and constitute a single essence. 

**Specific Meaning:**

* Just as curd, milk, etc., cannot exist without the attribute of "goras" (milk), similarly, substance cannot exist without attributes. 
* Conversely, just as "goras" cannot exist without curd, milk, etc., attributes cannot exist without substance. Therefore, both are inseparable. 

According to the "Abheda Naya" (principle of non-duality), there is no difference between substance and attributes. This is why the omniscient beings have declared that substance and attributes are non-dual, indivisible, and exist as a single entity. 

Alternatively, the first half of the verse can also be interpreted as saying that the Shramanas declare that substance and attributes are a single entity, which is the essence of all things. The word "bhava" (essence) is used to refer to this entity. As it is said, "Bhava, which is synonymous with substance and attributes, is the essence of all things."

Here, the meaning is that the pure substance, known as the "Shuddha Jiva Astikaya," which is indivisible from the pure attributes, is the object of pure knowledge. 

The commentator states that in any sentence where the word "naya" (principle) is not explicitly mentioned, it should be understood implicitly. This is similar to how the presence of a verb implies the presence of a noun, or how the word "syat" (perhaps) is understood even when not explicitly stated. 

**Commentary on the Next Verse:**

The next verse discusses the non-duality of substance and its qualities.

Page #54:
---------------------------
The translation preserving the Jain terms is as follows:

The description of the Shaddravya (six substances) and Panchaastikaya (five cosmic bodies) is that without Dravya (substance), Guna (attributes) do not exist, and without Guna, Dravya does not exist. Therefore, the state of being inseparable (Avyatirikta Bhava) exists for the Dravya and Guna.

The Pudgala (matter) is separate from Sparsha (touch), Rasa (taste), Gandha (smell), and Varna (color), just as Guna cannot exist without Dravya. And the Pudgala is not separate from Sparsha, Rasa, Gandha, and Varna, just as Dravya cannot exist without Guna. Therefore, even though there is some distinction in Dravya and Guna due to the difference in their modes, they are non-different in essence, as they are fixed in existence, interdependent, and have the same nature.

## Pancastikaya Prabhrut

**Pancastikaya Prabhrut, tadanukulanusthonam kartavyamiti sutra tatparyarthah || 13 || Evam gunaparyayaroopatri lakshanapratipadanarupena gathadvayam. Iti purvasutrena saha gathatrayasamudayena chaturthasthanam gatam.**

**Hindi Tatparyavritti Gatha - 13**

**Uththānikā - Āge niścayana yase dravya aur gunon kā abhed hai aisa dikhāte hain**

**Anvaya Sahit Samanyarth - (Daven) Dravyake (Vina) Vina (Gunā Pan) Gun nahin ho sakte tatha (Gunēhiṁ Vina) Gunon ke vina (Davvam) Dravy (Na Sambhavdi) Nahin sambhav hai (Tamha) Isliye (Davvagunāṇam) Dravy aur gunon ka (Avvadiritto Bhavo) Abhinnabhav [Havdi] Hota hai.**

**Vishesharth - Vrittikar Pul Dravyapar Ghatakar Kahte Hain Ki Jaise Pudgal Dravyaki Sattake Bina Usme Sparsh, Ras, Gandh, Varn Nahin Pae Ja Sakte Vaise Dravyake Bina Gun Nahin Hote Hain Tatha Jaise Varnaadi Gunonko Chhodakar Pul Dravy Nahin Milta Hai Vaise Gunonke Bina Dravy Nahin Prapt Ho Sakta Hai. Dravy Aur Gunonki Sattaa Abhinna Hai - Ek Hai, Kyunki Dravyaki Apeksha Ve Abhinna Hain. Dravy Aur Gunonke Pradesh Abhinna Hain - Ek Hain, Kyunki Kshetra Ki Apeksha Ekta Hai. Dravy Aur Gunonka Ek Hi Kal Utpad Vyaya Ka Avinabhav Hai Kyunki Kalki Apeksha Dono Ek Hain. Dravy Aur Gun Dono Ek Swaroop Hain Kyunki Unka Swabhav Ek Hai. Kyunki Dravy Aur Gunon Ka Dravy, Kshetra, Kal, Bhavonki Apeksha Abhed Hai Is Liye Dravy Aur Gun Abhinna Hain - Ek Hain. Athava Dusra Vyakhyan Karte Hain Ki, Bhav Jo Padarth Vah Dravy Aur Gunonse Abhinna Hai Arthat Dravy Gunaroop Hi Padarth Kaha Gaya Hai.

**Is Tarah Gun Paryayoonka Lakshana Karte Hue Do Gathaaen Purna Hui Va Unke Purva Sutrake Sath Tin Gathakea Samudayase Chautha Sthal Purna Hua.**

**Translation:**

**Pancastikaya Prabhrut, and so on, it is the duty to perform what is conducive to it, this is the meaning of the sutra || 13 || Thus, two verses are complete, which describe the characteristics of the categories of qualities. Along with the previous sutra, the fourth section is complete with the collection of three verses.**

**Hindi Meaning Commentary Verse - 13**

**Uththānikā - Further, it is shown that there is no difference between substance and qualities.**

**Meaning with Anvaya - (Daven) Without (Vina) substance (Gunā Pan) qualities cannot exist, and (Gunēhiṁ Vina) without qualities (Davvam) substance (Na Sambhavdi) cannot exist. (Tamha) Therefore, (Davvagunāṇam) substance and qualities are (Avvadiritto Bhavo) inseparable [Havdi].**

**Specific Meaning - The commentator says, reducing it to the substance, that just as touch, taste, smell, and color cannot be found in the substance of pudgala without its existence, so too, qualities cannot exist without substance. And just as the substance of pudgala cannot be found without qualities like color, etc., so too, substance cannot be obtained without qualities. The existence of substance and qualities is inseparable - one, because they are inseparable with respect to substance. The regions of substance and qualities are inseparable - one, because there is unity with respect to the region. Substance and qualities have the same time of origin and destruction, because both are one with respect to time. Substance and qualities are both of the same nature, because their nature is one. Because substance and qualities are inseparable with respect to substance, region, time, and states, therefore, substance and qualities are inseparable - one. Or, another explanation is given, that the state which is the object is inseparable from substance and qualities, that is, the object is said to be the form of substance and qualities. The pure substance of the soul, called the pure Jivastkay, which is free from the net of choices of the states of attachment, etc., and is filled with the group of qualities like pure knowledge, etc., is the one that is worthy of knowing or obtaining, which is the knowledge of self-awareness, which is the form of perception, attainment, and realization, which is the happiness of pure bliss, which is born from the power of the state of non-dual meditation, is the one that should be meditated upon with the mind, spoken of with words, and practiced with the body, this is the meaning of this sutra. || 13 ||**

**In this way, two verses are complete, which describe the characteristics of the categories of qualities, and with the collection of three verses along with the previous sutra, the fourth section is complete.**

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

**Verse 14 of the Abhaya Commentary**

Here, the sevenfold predication is stated due to the nature of the substance. It may be, it is not, it may be both, it may be inexpressible, and again, the threefold predication. Indeed, the substance is capable of sevenfold predication due to the nature of the predication.

**Explanation:**

1. The substance may be.
2. The substance may not be.
3. The substance may be and may not be.
4. The substance may be inexpressible.
5. The substance may be and may be inexpressible.
6. The substance may not be and may be inexpressible.
7. The substance may be, may not be, and may be inexpressible.

Here, the word "may be" is a general term that indicates the possibility of something. It is not a definitive statement. The substance is said to be "may be" when it is perceived from the perspective of its own nature, its own field, its own time, and its own state. The substance is said to be "may not be" when it is perceived from the perspective of another's nature, another's field, another's time, and another's state. The substance is said to be "may be and may not be" when it is perceived from the perspective of both its own nature, its own field, its own time, and its own state, and another's nature, another's field, another's time, and another's state. The substance is said to be "may be inexpressible" when it is perceived from the perspective of both its own nature, its own field, its own time, and its own state, and another's nature, another's field, another's time, and another's state, simultaneously. The substance is said to be "may be and may be inexpressible" when it is perceived from the perspective of its own nature, its own field, its own time, and its own state, simultaneously with another's nature, another's field, another's time, and another's state. The substance is said to be "may not be and may be inexpressible" when it is perceived from the perspective of another's nature, another's field, another's time, and another's state, simultaneously with another's nature, another's field, another's time, and another's state. The substance is said to be "may be, may not be, and may be inexpressible" when it is perceived from the perspective of its own nature, its own field, its own time, and its own state, simultaneously with another's nature, another's field, another's time, and another's state, and another's nature, another's field, another's time, and another's state.

This is not contradictory. Every object is non-empty due to its own nature, empty due to another's nature, both non-empty and empty, capable of being expressed, incapable of being expressed due to the combination of the predications, incapable of being expressed, both non-empty and incapable of being expressed.

##  The Sevenfold Predicament (Saptabhangi)

**The term 'syāt' (perhaps) is used as an indeclinable word in the sense of 'kathंचit' (in some way), which negates the absolute affirmation and indicates anekanta (multi-facetedness).**

Here, (1) when a substance is described in relation to its own substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'asti' (is). (2) When a substance is described in relation to another substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'nāsti' (is not). (3) When a substance is described in relation to its own substance, space, time, and mode, and then in relation to another substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'asti and nāsti' (is and is not). (4) When a substance is described simultaneously in relation to its own substance, space, time, and mode, and in relation to another substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'avaktāvya' (unspeakable). (5) When a substance is described in relation to its own substance, space, time, and mode, and simultaneously in relation to its own and another substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'asti and avaktāvya' (is and unspeakable). (6) When a substance is described in relation to another substance, space, time, and mode, and simultaneously in relation to its own and another substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'nāsti and avaktāvya' (is not and unspeakable). (7) When a substance is described in relation to its own substance, space, time, and mode, in relation to another substance, space, time, and mode, and simultaneously in relation to its own and another substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'asti, nāsti, and avaktāvya' (is, is not, and unspeakable).

**This (above mentioned) is not inappropriate, because all things (1) are 'ashunya' (non-empty) in relation to their own nature, etc., (2) are 'shunya' (empty) in relation to another nature, etc., (3) are 'ashunya and shunya' (non-empty and empty) in relation to both (their own nature, etc., and another nature, etc.), (4) are 'avachya' (unspeakable) in relation to both (their own nature, etc., and another nature, etc.) simultaneously, (5) are 'ashunya and avachya' (non-empty and unspeakable) when described in relation to the combination of the predicaments, (6) are 'shunya and avachya' (empty and unspeakable), (7) are 'ashunya, shunya, and avachya' (non-empty, empty, and unspeakable).** ||14||

**Verse 14 of the Sanskrit Tatparya Vritti**

Now, in order to refute all contradictions, the sevenfold predicament of evidence is explained.

"From a statement of evidence without contradiction,
The conception of existence, etc., which is the sevenfold predicament of truth, is considered to be true."

**Explanation:**

* **Siy Asthi:**  'Syāt asti' (perhaps is) - meaning, in some way, in relation to its own substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'asti' (is).
* **Siy Natthi:** 'Syāt nāsti' (perhaps is not) - meaning, in some way, in relation to another substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'nāsti' (is not).
* **Siy Asthi Natthi:** 'Syāt asti nāsti' (perhaps is and is not) - meaning, in some way, in relation to its own substance, space, time, and mode, and then in relation to another substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'asti and nāsti' (is and is not).
* **Siy Avvattavya:** 'Syāt avaktāvya' (perhaps unspeakable) - meaning, in some way, because it is impossible to speak simultaneously, as per the statement 'kram pravritti bharati' (the flow of the sequence), in relation to its own and another substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'avaktāvya' (unspeakable).
* **Punovitti Tattidayam:** 'Syāt asti avvattavya' (perhaps is and unspeakable) - meaning, in some way, in relation to its own substance, space, time, and mode, and simultaneously in relation to its own and another substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'asti and avaktāvya' (is and unspeakable).
* **Siy Natthi Avvattavya:** 'Syāt nāsti avvattavya' (perhaps is not and unspeakable) - meaning, in some way, in relation to another substance, space, time, and mode, and simultaneously in relation to its own and another substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'nāsti and avaktāvya' (is not and unspeakable).
* **Siy Asthi Natthi Avvattavya:** 'Syāt asti nāsti avvattavya' (perhaps is, is not, and unspeakable) - meaning, in some way, in relation to its own substance, space, time, and mode, in relation to another substance, space, time, and mode, and simultaneously in relation to its own and another substance, space, time, and mode, it is 'asti, nāsti, and avaktāvya' (is, is not, and unspeakable).

**Sanbhavati:** (It is possible)
**Kim Kartr:** (What is the agent?)
**Davyam:** (Substance)
**Khub Spuṭam:** (Clearly)
**Kathambhūtam:** (How is it?)
**Satta Bhang:** (Sevenfold Predicament)
**Kena:** (By what?)
**Ādesavaseṇ:** (By the question and answer)

## Explanation of the Five Categories of Substance and the Seven-fold Predicament

This section explains the seven-fold predicament (Saptabhangi) in relation to the five categories of substance (Dravyapanchaastika). 

**The Seven-fold Predicament:**

The seven-fold predicament arises from the seven possible ways of predicating something:

1. **Syat Asti (May Be):** It may be.
2. **Syat Nasti (May Not Be):** It may not be.
3. **Syat Asti Nasti (May Be and May Not Be):** It may be and may not be.
4. **Syat Avaktavya (May Be Indeterminate):** It may be indeterminate.
5. **Syat Asti Avaktavya (May Be and May Be Indeterminate):** It may be and may be indeterminate.
6. **Syat Nasti Avaktavya (May Not Be and May Be Indeterminate):** It may not be and may be indeterminate.
7. **Syat Asti Nasti Avaktavya (May Be, May Not Be, and May Be Indeterminate):** It may be, may not be, and may be indeterminate.

**How a Single Substance Can Be Subject to the Seven-fold Predicament:**

Just as a single person, Devadatta, can be described in many ways depending on the context (e.g., son, father, nephew, uncle, husband, brother, enemy, friend), so too can a single substance be described in seven ways depending on the perspective.

**Detailed Explanation:**

The seven-fold predicament can be applied to each of the seven categories of substance (existence, non-existence, both, indeterminate, existence and indeterminate, non-existence and indeterminate, existence, non-existence, and indeterminate).

**Example:**

Devadatta can be:

1. **Syat Putra (May Be a Son):** He may be a son.
2. **Syat Aputra (May Not Be a Son):** He may not be a son.
3. **Syat Putra Aputra (May Be a Son and May Not Be a Son):** He may be a son and may not be a son.
4. **Syat Avaktavya (May Be Indeterminate):** It may be indeterminate whether he is a son or not.
5. **Syat Putra Avaktavya (May Be a Son and May Be Indeterminate):** He may be a son and it may be indeterminate whether he is a son or not.
6. **Syat Aputra Avaktavya (May Not Be a Son and May Be Indeterminate):** He may not be a son and it may be indeterminate whether he is a son or not.
7. **Syat Putra Aputra Avaktavya (May Be a Son, May Not Be a Son, and May Be Indeterminate):** He may be a son, may not be a son, and it may be indeterminate whether he is a son or not.

**The Seven-fold Predicament and Statements:**

The phrase "Syat Asti Dravyam" (May Be Substance) indicates the seven-fold predicament. This is because:

* **Syat Asti:** This phrase is a general statement that applies to all substances.
* **Asti Dravyam:** This phrase is a specific statement that applies to a particular substance.

**Statements and Their Validity:**

* **Syat Asti:** This is a valid statement based on the seven-fold predicament.
* **Asti Dravyam:** This is a valid statement based on the seven-fold predicament.
* **Asti Dravyam:** This is an invalid statement based on the seven-fold predicament.
* **Asti Dravyam:** This is an invalid statement based on the seven-fold predicament.

**Conclusion:**

The seven-fold predicament is a fundamental principle of Jain philosophy that helps us understand the nature of reality. It teaches us that all things are subject to change and that our knowledge is always limited.

**Note:** This translation preserves the Jain terms and provides a detailed explanation of the seven-fold predicament. It also clarifies the application of the seven-fold predicament to the five categories of substance.

---------------------------
## Sevenfold Predicament (Saptabhangi)

**4. Panchaastikaya Prabhrit**

**55.** 

**(1)** **Syat Asti:**  Meaning, in some respects, the substance exists. This means the substance exists in relation to its own substance, space, time, and mode of existence (the fourfold). 

**(2)** **Syat Nasti:** Meaning, in some respects, the substance does not exist. This means the substance does not exist in relation to other substances, space, time, and mode of existence (the fourfold).

**(3)** **Syat Asti Nasti:** Meaning, in some respects, the substance both exists and does not exist. This means it exists in relation to its own fourfold but does not exist in relation to the other fourfold.

**(4)** **Syat Avaktvy:** Meaning, in some respects, the substance is inexpressible. This means it cannot be said at one time whether the substance exists in relation to its own fourfold or not in relation to the other fourfold, because it is said, "Kramapravritti Bharti" - speech can only be spoken in a sequential manner.

**(5)** **Syat Asti Avaktvy:** Meaning, in some respects, the substance exists and is inexpressible. This means it exists in relation to its own substance, space, time, and mode of existence, but simultaneously, its relation to its own and other substances, space, time, and mode of existence is inexpressible.

**(6)** **Syat Nasti Avaktvy:** Meaning, in some respects, the substance does not exist and is inexpressible. This means it does not exist in relation to other substances, space, time, and mode of existence, but simultaneously, its relation to its own and other substances, space, time, and mode of existence is inexpressible.

**(7)** **Syat Asti Nasti Avaktvy:** Meaning, in some respects, the substance exists, does not exist, and is inexpressible. This means it exists in relation to its own fourfold, does not exist in relation to the other fourfold, but simultaneously, its relation to its own and other substances, space, time, and mode of existence is inexpressible.

In this way, these seven predicaments are possible in relation to substance. 

**(1)** Does the substance exist? 
**(2)** Does the substance not exist? 
**(3)** Does the substance both exist and not exist? 
**(4)** Is the substance inexpressible? 
**(5)** Does the substance exist and is inexpressible? 
**(6)** Does the substance not exist and is inexpressible? 
**(7)** Does the substance exist, not exist, and is inexpressible?

When these questions are asked, they are answered in these seven ways. This is the nature of the Sevenfold Predicament.

How can the same substance have seven predicaments? To answer this, consider Devadatta, a man. He is one, but he is also many in relation to different perspectives. Devadatta is a father in relation to his son, a son in relation to his father, a nephew in relation to his uncle, an uncle in relation to his nephew, a husband in relation to his wife, a brother in relation to his sister, an enemy in relation to his enemy, and a friend in relation to his friend. Similarly, the same substance can have seven predicaments in relation to different perspectives. There is no fault in this, it is a general explanation. 

If we want a more subtle explanation, then the substance has an inherent nature of being, which is eternal...

Page #60:
---------------------------
## Description of the Six Substances and the Five Astikayas

In the description of each of the six substances, seven **bhangas** (categories) should be mentioned. These are:

* **Syat asti** (It may be), **Syat nasti** (It may not be), **Syat astinaasti** (It may be and may not be), **Syat avaktvy** (It may be unmentionable)
* **Syat ek** (It may be one), **Syat anek** (It may be many), **Syat ek-anek** (It may be one and many), **Syat avaktvy** (It may be unmentionable)
* **Syat nitya** (It may be eternal), **Syat anitya** (It may be non-eternal), **Syat nityanitya** (It may be eternal and non-eternal), **Syat avaktvy** (It may be unmentionable)

These seven **bhangas** for each substance are similar to the example of Devadatta. For example, the same Devadatta:

1. **Syat putra** (May be a son) - in relation to his father, he is a son.
2. **Syat aputra** (May not be a son) - in relation to others besides his father, he is not a son.
3. **Syat putra aputra** (May be both a son and not a son) - in relation to his father, he is a son, and in relation to others, he is not a son.
4. **Syat avaktvy** (May be unmentionable) - at the same time, with different perspectives, it cannot be said whether he is a son or not a son.
5. **Syat putra avaktvy** (May be a son and unmentionable) - when Devadatta is a son in relation to his father, at the same time, it is not possible to say whether he is a son or not a son, so it is unmentionable.
6. **Syat aputra avaktvy** (May not be a son and unmentionable) - when Devadatta is not a son in relation to others besides his father, at the same time, it is not possible to say whether he is a son or not a son, so it is unmentionable.
7. **Syat putra aputra avaktvy** (May be a son, not a son, and unmentionable) - in relation to his father, he is a son, in relation to others, he is not a son, and at the same time, it is not possible to say whether he is a son or not a son, so it is unmentionable.

In this way, one should understand the **saptabhangi** (sevenfold predication) through subtle explanation. By reading "**Syat dravya**" (It may be a substance), etc., the **saptabhangi** principle is understood.

Because the statement "**Syat asti**" (It may be) encompasses all things, it is a **pramana** (proof) statement. The statement "**Syat asti ev dravyam**" (It may be a substance) encompasses only one aspect of a thing, its mere existence, and therefore it is a **naya** (viewpoint) statement.

As it is said, "**Sakalaadesha pramanadheen, vikalaadesha nayadheen**" (The statement encompassing all aspects is under the purview of **pramana**, and the statement encompassing only a part is under the purview of **naya**).

"**Asti dravyam**" (It is a substance) is a **duhpramna** (incorrect proof) statement, and "**Asti ev dravyam**" (It is a substance) is a **durnya** (incorrect viewpoint) statement.

In this way, one should understand the explanation through **pramana** (proof) and other categories. Here, among the six substances, the **jivaastikaya** (living being) is the pure **atmadravya** (soul substance) that is worthy of being grasped.

This is the meaning.

Thus, the **saptabhangi** is explained through one sutra (aphorism). In this way, the first seven verses are completed in fourteen verses, with five **sthala** (categories).

## Time Explanation Verse 15

**Atrasadpradurabhavatvamutpadasy saducchedatvam vigamasya nishiddham.**

(The emergence of the non-existent, the destruction of the existent, and the cessation of the non-existent are prohibited.)

Page #61:
---------------------------
There is no destruction of a substance (bhaava) that exists (satka), nor is there any creation of a substance (bhaava) that does not exist (asatka). Substances (bhaava) undergo creation and destruction in the transformations of qualities (guna-paryaya).

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

**Sanskrit Commentary Verse 15**

Now, when there is a Dharmi (possessor of qualities), qualities are considered. There is no substance, so how can there be seven bhangas (modes of existence)?  Following the Buddhist view, the disciple raises this objection. In response, the Acharya presents a verse to refute this objection.  He refutes the momentary annihilationist Buddhist view by stating that according to the Dravyarthika Nay (substance-based perspective), there is no destruction of a real substance, and there is no creation of a non-existent substance.

**Meaning:**

* There is no destruction (naso) of a substance (bhavasa).
* Similarly, there is no creation (uppaado) of a non-existent substance (abhavaassa).
* Substances (bhaasa) undergo change (pakuvvanti) in their qualities (gunapjjayeasu) through creation and destruction.

**Explanation:**

* Just as there is no creation or destruction of the substance called "goraasa" (milk) in its own form, similarly, there is no creation or destruction of the substance called "jiva" (soul) in its own form.
* However, the qualities of "goraasa" (milk) like color, taste, smell, and touch undergo transformation. When the "goraasa" (milk) transforms into "navanita" (butter), it is destroyed, but it does not transform into "ghrita" (clarified butter).
* Similarly, the substance called "jiva" (soul) exists in its own form, but its qualities undergo transformation. The six substances (jiva, ajiva, etc.) are the agents of these transformations.

**Note:**

* The text mentions "shuddha parinaamik parambhava grahaka" (purely transformative ultimate reality) and "shuddha dravyarthika nay" (pure substance-based perspective).
* It also mentions "nishchaya nay" (definitive perspective) and "krodha, mana, bhaya, aloba, drish, shruta, anubhuta, bhoga, aakanksha, rupanidana, bandha, adi paribhava shunya" (free from the influence of anger, mind, fear, non-greed, sight, hearing, experience, enjoyment, desire, form, cause, and bondage).
* The text concludes by stating that the pure soul (shuddha jiva) is filled with infinite knowledge and bliss (chidananda ekasvabhaava) and should be meditated upon.

**Hindi Commentary Verse 15**

**Uththānikā:**  Further, the disciple who follows the Buddhist view raises this doubt or objection: If there is a Dharmi (possessor of qualities), then one should consider his qualities or nature. If there is no substance, then how can there be seven bhangas (modes of existence)?

**Answer:** The Acharya responds by saying that according to the Dravyarthika Nay (substance-based perspective), there is no destruction of a real substance, and there is no creation of a non-existent substance. In this way, he refutes the momentary annihilationist Buddhist view.

**General Meaning with Anvaya (word order):**

* (Bhavasa) Substance (naso) destruction (nasthi) does not happen, (cheva) similarly (abhavaassa) non-existence (uppaado) creation (nasthi) does not happen.
* (Bhaasa) Substance (gunapjjayeasu) in its qualities (uppaadavaye) creation and destruction (pakuvvanti) keep happening.

**Specific Meaning:**

* For example, "goraasa" (milk) is a substance. There is no creation or destruction of "goraasa" (milk) in its own form. However, the qualities of "goraasa" (milk) like color, taste, smell, and touch undergo transformation. When the "goraasa" (milk) transforms into "navanita" (butter), it is destroyed, but it does not transform into "ghrita" (clarified butter).

**Verse 15 concludes the first section of the second saptaka (seven verses) and presents a refutation of the Buddhist view on substance.**

Page #63:
---------------------------
Just as there are synonyms in the Prakrit language, so too are the six substances, namely, the living being, etc., which are eternally existent, never destroyed in terms of substance, according to the substance-based viewpoint. And those substances that are non-existent or not present, such as the living being, etc., are never produced in terms of substance, according to the substance-based viewpoint. However, the six substances, namely, the living being, etc., are produced and destroyed as much as possible in terms of synonyms, according to the synonym-based viewpoint, in the context of the synonyms of qualities. For example, there are synonyms such as male, female, hell-being, etc., in living beings, and synonyms such as two-atom, aggregate, etc., in matter. And there are synonyms in dharma due to the presence of motion-cooperative, in adharma due to the presence of stability-cooperative, in space due to the presence of immersion-cooperative, and in time due to the presence of duration-cooperative. Here, in the context of the six substances, one should meditate on the pure self-substance called the living being, which is filled with infinite, eternal, knowledge-bliss, and is free from the causes of bondage, such as anger, pride, deceit, greed, and the desire for experienced pleasures, according to the pure substance-based viewpoint, which accepts the pure result-based ultimate reality, or according to the definitive viewpoint, even though it is devoid of these causes of bondage or free from production and destruction. This is the meaning. In this way, the sutra was spoken, establishing the substance for the Buddhists in the second septet. ||15||

Time Explanation Verse-16
Here, the synonyms of qualities and states are explained. The states are the living being, etc., and the qualities of the living being are consciousness, etc., and their use. There are many synonyms for the living being, such as celestial being, human being, hell-being, and animal. ||16||

States are the living being, etc., the six substances. Their qualities and synonyms are well-known. However, they are mentioned here for the sake of clarity, as will be explained in the examples to be given. The qualities of the living being are pure consciousness, which is characterized by knowledge and experience, impure consciousness, which is characterized by the experience of action and its results, and the use of both, which is characterized by the result that follows consciousness and is in the form of with-thought and without-thought, and which encompasses all forms of thought and non-thought, both pure and impure. Synonyms, however, are pure, being characterized by the increase and decrease of gross and subtle qualities, and the removal and attainment of qualities. Those obtained from the sutras are impure, being characterized by celestial being, human being, hell-being, and animal, due to the absence of connection with other substances. ||16||

Hindi Time Explanation Verse-16
Anvayaartha (Living being, etc.) Living being, etc. (substance) They (states) are 'states'. (Substance, object)

## Description of Six Substances, Five Astikayas (Qualities of the Soul)

**Qualities of the Soul (Consciousness and Utilization)**

Consciousness and utilization are the qualities of the soul.

**Synonyms of the Soul**

The soul has many synonyms, such as deva (god), manushya (human), naraka (hell being), and tiryanch (animal).

**Commentary:**

Here, we are explaining the **bhavas (substances)**, **gunas (qualities)**, and **paryayas (synonyms)**.

The six substances, starting with the soul, are the **bhavas**. Their qualities and synonyms are well-known. However, to clarify the examples that will be given in the next verse, we are mentioning the qualities and synonyms of the soul here.

The qualities of the soul are **pure consciousness** in the form of knowledge and perception, and **impure consciousness** in the form of action and the experience of its fruits. There are two types of utilization: **pure** and **impure**, which are characterized by **savikalpa (with discrimination)** and **nirvikalpa (without discrimination)**, respectively. They are also characterized by **purity, impurity, and mixed states**.

The synonyms of the soul are as follows:

* **Pure synonyms** are those that arise from the **increase or decrease of the qualities of the soul**.
* **Impure synonyms** are those that are mentioned in this verse, such as deva, naraka, tiryanch, and manushya. They arise from the **relationship with other substances**.

**Verse 16:**

Thus, the qualities and synonyms of the substances mentioned in the previous verse are explained.

**Sanskrit Commentary:**

The substances starting with the soul are the **bhavas**. What are they? The six substances starting with the soul, and the four substances starting with dharma, have qualities and synonyms, which will be explained in detail in their respective places. Here, we are explaining the qualities of the soul.

The qualities of the soul are consciousness and utilization. What are they? There are two types of consciousness: pure and impure. **Knowledge and perception** are the utilization of pure consciousness. This is a summary statement, a **vartika (commentary)**, a **samudaya-kathana (general statement)**, a **tatparya-arthakathana (statement of meaning)**, and a **sampindita-arthakathana (statement of condensed meaning)**.

For example, **knowledge-consciousness** is called **pure consciousness**, while **karma-consciousness** and **karma-phala-consciousness** are called **impure consciousness**. These three types of consciousness will be explained in detail later in the section on consciousness.

Now, we will explain utilization. **Savikalpa** is the utilization of knowledge, while **nirvikalpa** is the utilization of perception. There are eight types of knowledge-utilization: **mati (belief)**, **shruta (scriptural knowledge)**, **avadhi (clairvoyance)**, **manas-paryaya (knowledge of the mind)**, and **kevala-jnana (omniscience)**. There are also three types of **ajnana (ignorance)**: **kumati (wrong belief)**, **kushrut (wrong scriptural knowledge)**, and **vibhang (wrong perception)**.

Among these, **kevala-jnana** is **pure** and **kshayika (impermanent)** because it is **niravarana (without obstacles)**. The other seven types of knowledge, starting with **mati**, are **impure** and **kshaya-upashamaka (mitigating impermanence)** because they are **savarana (with obstacles)**.

There are four types of perception-utilization: **chakshu (visual perception)**, **achakshu (non-visual perception)**, **avadhi (clairvoyance)**, and **kevala-darshan (omniscience)**. Among these, **kevala-darshan** is **pure** and **kshayika** because it is **niravarana**. The other three types of perception, starting with **chakshu**, are **impure** and **kshaya-upashamaka** because they are **savarana**.

Now, we will explain the synonyms of the soul. The synonyms of the soul are **deva, naraka, tiryanch, and manushya**. There are many synonyms of the soul.

Furthermore, there are two types of synonyms: **dravya-paryaya (synonyms of substance)** and **guna-paryaya (synonyms of quality)**.

The definition of **dravya-paryaya** is as follows: **A dravya-paryaya is the cause of the unity of many substances, which is based on the understanding of that unity.** It is like the unity of many substances in a single entity.

There are two types of **dravya-paryaya**: **samanajaatiya (of the same kind)** and **asamanajaatiya (of different kinds)**.

**Samanajaatiya** is defined as follows: **Two, three, or four or more paramāṇu (atoms) or pudgala (matter) substances combine to form a single entity.**

Page #65:
---------------------------
Jain terms preserved in the translation:

The five Astikaya (substances) are said to be related to the non-sentient (achetana) by the other non-sentient (achetana). The dissimilar (asamanajatiya) is said to be the origination of the embodied soul (jiva) in the form of human, divine, etc. due to the association of the karmic matter (pudgala) with the sentient (chetana) jiva. The similar (samanajatiya) and dissimilar (asamanajatiya) are the modifications (paryaya) of the single-natured (ekarupa) substances (dravya) of the jiva and pudgala. They are impure (ashudha). Why? Due to the mutual association (samshlesha) of the many substances. The modifications (paryaya) do not occur by the mutual association of substances like dharma, etc. Even the pure (shuddha) modifications do not arise.

Now, the Muga (a type of soul) is explained. They are of two types based on the distinction of inherent nature (svabhava) and modified nature (vibhava). The guna-paryaya, which is the basis for the apprehension of the oneness of the inherent nature, is present in a single substance, like the color of green and white, etc. in the pudgala. In the jiva, it is in the form of knowledge, perception, etc., like the transition of one knowledge to another. Thus, the modifications (paryaya) in the form of the inherent and modified qualities of the jiva and pudgala should be known.

The inherent nature (svabhava) qualities are common to all substances and are in the form of increase and decrease of the qualities of lightness and heaviness, etc. Thus, the inherent nature (svabhava) and modified nature (vibhava) qualities should be known.

Alternatively, the paryayas are of two types: artha-paryaya (meaning-modifications) and vyanjana-paryaya (expression-modifications). The artha-paryayas are momentary and are the objects of speech, while the vyanjana-paryayas are stable, long-lasting, objects of speech, and are the objects of the deluded perception.

These modified (vibhava) vyanjana-paryayas of the jiva are the human, infernal, etc. forms, while the inherent nature (svabhava) vyanjana-paryaya of the jiva is the siddha (liberated) form.

The impure (ashudda) artha-paryayas of the jiva should be known in the six stages of the passions (kshaya, upashama, etc.) and the auspicious and inauspicious psychic dispositions (leshya). The modified (vibhava) artha-paryayas of the pudgala are in the form of transformation of color, etc. in the skandhas (aggregates) like the atom, etc. The modified (vibhava) vyanjana-paryayas of the pudgala are also known to be long-lasting in the skandhas like the atom, etc.

The pure (shudda) artha-paryayas, in the form of increase and decrease of the qualities of lightness and heaviness, etc., have already been explained earlier in the description of the inherent nature (svabhava) qualities.

These artha-paryayas and vyanjana-paryayas are present among the inherent nature (svabhava) and modified nature (vibhava) dravya-paryayas and guna-paryayas of the jiva and pudgala, which were mentioned in the previous verse "Jesim atthisahao". The purpose of explaining them separately is to indicate the distinction based on time, as the artha-paryayas are momentary, while the vyanjana-paryayas are long-lasting.

The essential meaning here is that the pure (shuddha) paryaya, which has attained the siddha (liberated) form, is the upadeya (worth accepting) pure (shudda) substance of the jiva.

---------------------------
## Chapter 62: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

This chapter aims to explain the six substances and five astikayas. The six substances are: **Jiva**, **Pudgala**, **Dharma**, **Adharma**, **Akasha**, and **Kala**. The qualities and categories of the four substances, Dharma and the rest, will be explained in detail later. Here, we will first discuss the qualities of **Jiva**.

The qualities of **Jiva** are **Chetana** (consciousness) and **Upayoga** (application). **Chetana** has two types: **Shuddha Chetana** (pure consciousness) and **Ashuddha Chetana** (impure consciousness). **Upayoga** also has two types: **Jnana Upayoga** (knowledge application) and **Darshan Upayoga** (perception application). **Jnana Chetana** is considered **Shuddha Chetana**. **Karma Chetana** (action consciousness) and **Karmaphal Chetana** (fruit of action consciousness) are considered **Ashuddha Chetana**. The nature of these three types of **Chetana** will be explained in detail later under the heading of **Chetana**.

**Jnana Upayoga** is **Savikalpa** (with discrimination), while **Darshan Upayoga** is **Nirvikalpa** (without discrimination). **Jnana Upayoga** has eight types: **Mati**, **Shruta**, **Avadhi**, **Man:paryaya**, and **Kevala** - these five are **Samyag Jnana** (right knowledge). The other three are **Kumati**, **Kushruta**, and **Vibhang Jnana** (wrong knowledge). Among these, **Kevala Jnana** is pure and free from all **Avarana** (coverings). The remaining seven types of knowledge, starting with **Mati Jnana**, are **Kshayopa-shamic** (mitigating the obscurations), have **Avarana**, and are impure.

**Darshan Upayoga** has four types: **Chakshu Darshan** (eye perception), **Achakshu Darshan** (non-eye perception), **Avadhi Darshan** (clairvoyance), and **Kevala Darshan** (omniscience). Among these, **Devan Darshan** (divine perception) is the most common, free from **Avarana**, and pure. The other three, **Chakshu** and the rest, are **Kshayopa-shamic**, have **Avarana**, and are impure.

Now, we will discuss the **Paryayas** (categories) of **Jiva**. **Deva**, **Manushya**, **Naraki**, and **Tiryanch** are the **Vibhava** (potential) **Dravya Paryayas** of **Jiva**. These **Paryayas** are of many types. There are two types of **Paryayas**: **Dravya Paryaya** (substance category) and **Guna Paryaya** (quality category).

The definition of **Dravya Paryaya** is: the cause of the knowledge of the unity of many substances. For example, calling a vehicle made of many parts as a single entity. **Dravya Paryaya** is of two types: **Samaan Jaatiya** (same species) and **Asamaan Jaatiya** (different species). **Samaan Jaatiya** refers to the **Skandha** (aggregate) formed by the combination of two, three, four, or more **Paramanu** (atoms) of **Pudgala Dravya**. These **Skandhas** are formed due to the association of **Achetana** (non-conscious) with **Achetana**, hence they are called **Samaan Jaatiya Dravya Paryaya**.

**Asamaan Jaatiya** refers to the situation when a **Jiva** transmigrates to another **Gati** (realm) and acquires new **No-karma Pudgalas** (non-karmic particles) in the form of a new body. This leads to the birth of **Manushya**, **Deva**, and other **Paryayas**. The **Paryaya** formed by the combination of **Chetana** (conscious) **Jiva** with **Achetana** (non-conscious) **Pudgala** is called **Asamaan Jaatiya Dravya Paryaya**.

These **Samaan Jaatiya** and **Asamaan Jaatiya** **Dravya Paryayas**, which are the unity of many substances, occur only in **Jiva** and **Pudgala**. They are impure because they are formed by the combination of many substances. **Dharma**, **Adharma**, **Akasha**, and **Kala** do not have any **Paryayas** formed by mutual combination. They also do not have any impure **Paryayas** due to association with other substances.

Now, we will discuss **Guna Paryayas**. They are also of two types: **Swabhava Guna Paryaya** (inherent quality category) and **Vibhava Guna Paryaya** (potential quality category). The **Paryaya** that is the cause of the knowledge of the unity within due to the quality is called **Guna Paryaya**. It occurs within a single substance. For example, the **Pudgala** in the form of a mango fruit...

Page #67:
---------------------------
The five *āstikāyas* (types of soul) have their own *varṇaguṇas* (color-qualities) which are described by terms like green, yellow, etc. Each *āstikāya* has a unique *varṇaguṇa* which is why it is called a *guṇaparyāya* (quality-category). The soul's knowledge, such as *matijñāna* (knowledge of perception), *śruta-jñāna* (knowledge of scriptures), etc., are also *guṇaparyāyas* because they are different forms of knowledge. Each *guṇaparyāya* represents a unique aspect of the knowledge quality. It is important to understand the *vibhava* (potential) and *svabhāva* (inherent) *guṇaparyāyas* of both the soul and *pudgala* (matter). The *svabhāva* *guṇaparyāyas* are the six *guṇas* (qualities) of *aguru* (heavy), *laghu* (light), *haani* (diminution), *vṛddhi* (increase), etc., which are common to all substances. In this way, one should understand the *svabhāva* and *vibhava* *guṇaparyāyas*.

Alternatively, there are two types of *paryāyas*: *artha-paryāya* (meaning-category) and *vyañjana-paryāya* (expression-category). *Artha-paryāyas* are extremely subtle and exist only for a fleeting moment, disappearing as quickly as they appear. They are not perceptible to speech. *Vyañjana-paryāyas* are gross, lasting for a longer duration, perceptible to speech, and even visible to those with limited knowledge. The *vibhava* *vyañjana-paryāyas* of the soul are its various states, such as human, hellish, etc., while the *svabhāva* *vyañjana-paryāya* is the soul's state of liberation. The *artha-paryāyas* of the soul, which are not pure, are to be understood as the states of purification or defilement that arise from the increase or decrease of the soul's *kaṣāyas* (passions) and the six *leśyā* (shades of karma). The *vibhava* *artha-paryāyas* of *pudgala* are the changes in the *skandhas* (aggregates) of two atoms, etc., from one *varṇa* (color) to another. The *vibhava* *vyañjana-paryāyas* of *pudgala* are the *skandhas* of two atoms, etc., which persist for a long time. The *śuddha* (pure) *artha-paryāyas* are the six *guṇas* of *aguru*, *laghu*, *haani*, *vṛddhi*, etc., which we have already discussed in the context of *svabhāva* *guṇaparyāyas* as being common to all substances.

These *artha-paryāyas* and *vyañjana-paryāyas* are implicit in the verses like "Just as there are many *sahaos* (companions)" etc., which describe the *svabhāva* and *vibhava* *dravya-paryāyas* (substance-categories) and *svabhāva* and *vibhava* *guṇaparyāyas* of the soul and *pudgala*. They are also present within the *dravya-paryāyas* and *guṇaparyāyas* mentioned in this verse. Why then are they mentioned separately? The answer is that *artha-paryāyas* are said to exist only for a moment, while *vyañjana-paryāyas* are said to exist for a long time. They are mentioned to highlight this difference in duration. The implication here is that one should strive to attain the pure *jīvā-āstikāya* (soul-category), the pure *ātma-dravya* (soul-substance), which is capable of transforming into the state of liberation.

**Verse 17:**

This is an example of the prohibition of the arising of the thought of existence and non-existence. A human being thinks, "This body is mine, this god is mine." But the soul is neither existent nor non-existent, nor is it born from another.

Page #68:

##  Verse 64: Explanation of the Five Categories of Substance

**A being who has lost their human form becomes a god or something else. In both cases, the essence of life is neither destroyed nor created anew.**

**Commentary:**

This verse explains that the essence of life (Jiva) is not destroyed or created anew when a being changes its form. It is like a river that flows continuously, changing its form as it passes through different landscapes. The essence of the river remains the same, even though its form changes.

The verse states that a being who has lost their human form (through death) becomes a god or something else (like a hell being or an animal) due to their past actions. However, the essence of life (Jiva) remains the same. It is not destroyed or created anew.

The verse also explains that the change in form is not a real destruction or creation. It is a transformation, a change in the way the essence of life manifests itself. The essence of life remains the same, but its form changes according to the actions of the being.

This verse refutes the idea that the essence of life is destroyed or created anew. It emphasizes that the essence of life is eternal and unchanging. It only changes its form according to the actions of the being.

**Verse 17**

**General Meaning:** (The embodied being) This embodied worldly being (by the category of being a human) is destroyed as a human (and becomes) a god (or) another (being). In both states, the being-substance (is not destroyed) nor is another being produced.

**Specific Meaning:** This worldly being, if it is in a human body and dies, then by virtue of its merit, it becomes a god or by virtue of its own karma, it becomes another being, a hell-being, an animal, or a human. Although, from the perspective of categories, the human existence is destroyed, but from the perspective of substance, the being that had the human existence is not destroyed. Similarly, although from the perspective of categories, the god category is produced, but from the perspective of substance, no new being is produced, but it is the same being that was previously in the human category. Therefore, it is certain that even though there is production and destruction from the perspective of categories, there is no production and destruction from the perspective of substance. This explanation refutes the view of momentary oneness and the view of eternal oneness.

**Verse 18**

**Meaning:** Even though there is production and destruction, the substance is always undestroyed and unproduced.

**Commentary:** The same being that takes birth and dies is not destroyed, nor is it produced. The being that is produced and destroyed is a god, a human, etc., which is a category. The being that is perceived as arising and ceasing, due to the contact of the categories of previous and subsequent existence, is the same being that is perceived as undestroyed and unproduced, due to its inherent nature, which is the basis of its constant oneness. Categories, however, are described as having the nature of being capable of destruction, being like the previous transformation and being the production of the subsequent transformation. They are said to be distinct from the substance. Therefore, the being-substance, which is one with the categories, is to be seen as always unproduced and undestroyed, even though it is born and dies. The categories of god, human, etc., arise and cease due to their sequential nature, being present and then passing away, and being produced and destroyed at their respective times.

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

**Verse 18 of the Hindi Time Explanation**

**Meaning:** (It is the same) The same (jati) birth it receives and the same (maranm yati) death it attains, however (na ev utpannah) it is not born (cha) and (na nashttah) not destroyed, (dev: manushyah) the god, the human (iti paryayah) such synonyms (utpannah) are born (cha) and (vinashtah) destroyed.

**Commentary:** Here, although the substance is said to be subject to destruction and production, it is always said to be indestructible and unproduced.

The substance that appears to be destroyed and produced by the separation from the previous synonym and the combination with the next synonym, the same (substance) is known to be indestructible and unproduced due to its inherent nature, which is the cause of the constant-one-reality, in relation to that nature. Its synonyms are said to be of the nature of destruction and production due to the destruction of the previous result and the production of the next result, and they (synonyms) are said to be inseparable from the substance in reality. Therefore, even though it is born and dies due to the oneness with the synonyms, the living substance is always seen (believed) to be unproduced and indestructible. The synonyms like god, human, etc., are born and destroyed because they are sequential, their own time is present and passes. ||18||

**Sanskrit Meaning Explanation Verse 18**

Now, the same meaning is strengthened again by two arguments: - So che jadi-sa cha ev jivapadarthah paryayarthikanayena devaparyayarupaam jatimutpattim jadi-yati gachchati sa chaiva maranam-maranm yati. Na naho na uppppanoh. Dravyarthikanayena punar na nashttoh na chotpannah. Tarhi kosau nashttah kosau utpannah?

##  Pancastikaya Prabhrit

**Hindi Tatparyavritti Gatha-18 Uththanika -**  Further, these two Nayas (principles) strengthen this meaning.

**Anvaya Saha Samanyarth -** (So Cheva Jadi) The same Jiva (soul) is born who (Maranam Jadi) attains death. (Na Nattho) In reality, the Jiva is neither destroyed (Na Chaiva Uppanno) nor born. (Devo Manusuutti Pajjao) The categories of Deva (god) or Manushya (human) are (Uppanno Ya Vinattho) born and destroyed.

**Vishesharth -**  According to the Paryayarthika Naya (principle of categories), the same Jiva attains the Deva category who was previously in the Manushya category.  From a Paakshika (conventional) perspective, no Jiva is destroyed or born. Then, who is destroyed and who is born?  For this, it is said that according to the Paryayarthika Naya, the Deva category is born and the Manushya category is destroyed. 

Here, someone might question: If there is birth and destruction in a substance, then how can it be eternal? And if the substance is eternal, then how can there be birth and destruction in it? These two things are contradictory, like the opposition between cold and hot.

To address this objection, the Acharya (teacher) explains that in the view of those who believe that the substance is eternally one or eternally transient, this objection is valid. Because, the aspect of eternity cannot exist in the same way as the aspect of transience, and vice versa. This is because they consider the substance to be of one form.

In Jainism, the substance is considered to have multiple aspects. Therefore, according to the Dravyarthika Naya (principle of substance), the aspect of eternity exists in the substance with respect to its Dravyatva (substance-ness), and according to the Paryayarthika Naya, the aspect of transience exists in the substance with respect to its Paryaya (category). These two, Dravya and Paryaya, are interdependent. This interdependence was already mentioned in this Gatha: "Pajjayarhiyam Davvam Davvimutta Ya Pajjaya Pasthi". 

Therefore, by explaining through the Dravyarthika and Paryayarthika Nayas, with the primary and secondary aspects, both eternity and transience exist in the same substance. Just like in the same Devadatta, both fatherhood and sonship are established. There is no contradiction in this. ||18||

**Samaya Vyakhya Gatha-19**  Here, the non-destruction and non-birth of the soul are presented as the standpoint of permanence.

**Evam Sado Vinaso Asado Jivass Natthi Uppaado. Tavadiyo Jivaanam Devo Manuso Tti Gadinaamo. ||19||**

Thus, there is no destruction of the eternal and no birth of the non-eternal.  Therefore, the Jivas are called Deva or Manushya. ||19||

Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas, and the Non-Destruction of the Real and the Non-Production of the Unreal.
The life of a being is not destroyed, nor is an unreal being produced.
The life of beings is only as long as the names of their states, such as god and human. ||19||
If, indeed, the being that dies is the same one that is born, and the being that is born is the same one that dies, then it is established that there is no destruction of the real and no production of the unreal.
What is said, that a god is born and a human dies, is not contradictory because the god-state and human-state names, which are the creators of the limited-time god-state and human-state, are only as long as those states.
Just as the many segments of a large bamboo stalk, being limited in their own measure, do not go to another segment, but are present in their own places and absent in other places, and the bamboo, though present in all the segments, is absent in relation to another segment because of the absence of a connection to that segment, so also the many human-state and other states of a single life substance, which exists for an unlimited period of three times, being limited in their own measure, do not go to another state, but are present in their own places and absent in other places, and the life substance, though present in all the states, is absent in relation to another state because of the absence of a connection to that state. ||19||
Hindi Time Explanation Verse-19 _ Anvayaartha (evam) thus (jivasya) of the being (satah vinashah) the destruction of the real and (asatah utpadah) the production of the unreal (na asti) is not (dev janmata hai aur manushya marata hai aisa kaha jata hai uska yah karan hai ki) (jivaanam) of the beings (dev: manushya:) god, human (iti gatinaam) such state-names (tavat) only as long as (kalaka hota hai).
Commentary-Here, the non-destruction of the real and the non-production of the unreal are said from the side of certainty.
If, indeed, the being that dies is the same one that is born, and the being that is born is the same one that dies, then it is established that there is no destruction of the real and no production of the unreal. And what is said, that a god is born and a human dies, is (also) not contradictory because the limited-time god-state and human-state, which are the creators of the limited-time god-state and human-state, are only as long as those states. Just as the many segments of a large bamboo stalk, being limited in their own measure, do not go to another segment, but are present in their own places and absent in other places, and the bamboo, though present in all the segments, is absent in relation to another segment because of the absence of a connection to that segment, so also the many human-state and other states of a single life substance, which exists for an unlimited period of three times, being limited in their own measure, do not go to another state, but are present in their own places and absent in other places, and the life substance, though present in all the states, is absent in relation to another state because of the absence of a connection to that state.

Page #73:
---------------------------
69
Even though it has a being in all the states of the five astikayas, it is also non-existent due to the absence of the relation of another astikaya by the relation of another astikaya. ||19||
Sanskrit Tatparya Vritti Gatha-19
Thus, it is certain that from the perspective of the dravya-arthicnaya, there is no destruction of the sat and no production of the asat.
Thus, even though from the perspective of the paryayarthicnaya, production and destruction occur in the form of humans, narakas, etc., from the perspective of the dravya-arthicnaya, there is no destruction of the existing sat and no production of the asat, which is the absence of knowledge. Of what? Of the being, the jiva-padartha.
Now, if it is not to be produced, then how does the explanation that it exists in the bhogabhumi for the duration of three palyas and then dies, or that it exists in the deva-loka and naraka-loka for the duration of thirty-three sagaras and then dies, etc., hold true?
The amount that is said of the jivas, such as deva, manushya, etc., is the paryay, which is caused by the karma-udaya, which is called the गतिनामक. It is not the amount of the dravya itself, so there is no contradiction like the bamboo stick.
Just as a large bamboo stick has many joints that exist in their own places and are present, and are absent in the places of other joints, and the bamboo stick itself, though present in all the joints, is said to be absent in the second joint in the form of the first joint, so also the jiva, which is in the place of the bamboo stick, has many paryayas in the form of human, naraka, etc., which are present in their own time of karma-udaya and are absent in the time of other paryayas, and the jiva itself, though present in all the paryayas in all the joints, is said to be absent in the deva-adi paryayas in the form of the manushya-adi paryayas.
If it is asked how the same thing can be both eternal and non-eternal, then the answer is: Just as in the case of a certain Devadatta, the desire for a son is secondary when there is a desire for a father, and the desire for a father is secondary when there is a desire for a son, so also in the case of a certain jiva, or the jiva-dravya, from the perspective of the dravya-arthicnaya, the non-eternality in the form of the paryay is secondary when there is a desire for eternality, and the eternality in the form of the dravya is secondary when there is a desire for non-eternality in the form of the paryay. Why? Because the desired is the primary.
Here, even though there is non-eternality in the form of the paryay, from the perspective of the pure dravya-arthicnaya, the pure jiva-astikaya, which is imperishable and infinite knowledge, etc., is the pure atma-dravya, which is to be contemplated as the object of attainment by the removal of raga, etc. ||19||
Thus, in the first place, a single-verse gatha was spoken earlier to refute the Buddhist view, and in the second place, four gathas were spoken to explain it.
Hindi Tatparya Vritti Gatha-19
Uththānikā - Further, we assert that from the perspective of the dravya-arthicnaya, there is no destruction of the sat and no production of the asat. This is the established truth.
Anvaya Sahit Samanyarth - (evam) In this way, as we have said before, (sado jivas) the sat substance, the jiva, (vinas) does not perish, and (asado) the asat substance, the jiva, (uppado) does not come into existence. (jivaan) The worldly jivas (tavadio) are in such a state, which (devo manusoti gadinaamo) is the result of their karma-udaya, which is called the deva or manushya-gati.

Page #74:
---------------------------
In the first three verses, it has been stated that although the substance of the living being (Jiva) is subject to birth and death in the form of human, animal, etc., according to the **Paryaya** (relational) viewpoint, yet according to the **Dravya** (substance) viewpoint, the **Satrupa** (existing substance) does not perish, and the **Asatrupa** (non-existing substance) is not born. Here, someone may doubt that if the living being does not experience birth and death, then how is it proven that this living being stays in the **Bhogabhumi** (realm of experience) for three **Palyas** (units of time) and then dies, or stays in the **Devagati** (heavenly realm) or **Narakagati** (hellish realm) for thirty-three **Sagaras** (units of time) and then dies? The answer is that this state of three **Palyas**, etc., mentioned for the living beings, is the measure of the state of the **Paryaya** (relational) of the **Dev** (god) or **Manushya** (human) born from the **Uday** (arising) of the **Namakarma** (karmic influence) called **Dev** or **Manushya** (god or human), and not of the **Jiva** (living being) substance. There is no contradiction in this, as illustrated by the example of a bamboo stick. Just as in a very large bamboo stick, many knots are present in their respective places, these knots are not present on top of each other, i.e., each knot or **Parya** (segment) has its own distinct existence, but the bamboo stick is present in all the **Paryas** (segments) in a **Anvayarupa** (consequential) manner, yet it can be said that it is not in the same place in the second **Parya** (segment) as it is in the first **Parya** (segment). Similarly, in this **Jiva** (living being) substance, like the bamboo stick, there are many **Paryas** (relational states) like human, animal, etc., present in their respective times of **Ayukarma** (life-span karma) **Uday** (arising). These **Paryas** (relational states) are not present in the time of each other's **Paryas** (relational states) - all **Paryas** (relational states) are distinct, and this **Jiva** (living being) is present in all its **Paryas** (relational states) in a **Anvayarupa** (consequential) manner, yet it can be said that it is not in the **Dev** (god) etc. **Paryas** (relational states) in the form of **Manushya** (human) etc. **Paryas** (relational states). In other words, it is proven that the same **Jiva** (living being) is eternal and the same **Jiva** (living being) is impermanent. How? It is said that just as when **Devadatta** is seen from the perspective of a son, the aspect of fatherhood is secondary, and when he is seen from the perspective of a father, the aspect of sonship is secondary. Similarly, when a **Jiva** (living being) substance is considered from the **Dravya** (substance) viewpoint, the aspect of impermanence from the **Paryaya** (relational) viewpoint is secondary, and when it is considered from the **Paryaya** (relational) viewpoint, the aspect of eternity from the **Dravya** (substance) viewpoint is secondary. Because what is desired is considered primary. The meaning here is that although it is impermanent from the **Paryaya** (relational) viewpoint, it is the pure **Jiva** (living being) substance, the pure **Atmadravya** (soul substance) called **Jivaastikaya** (living being body) which is eternal, infinite knowledge, etc., from the pure **Dravya** (substance) viewpoint, and it is this that should be embraced by abandoning the **Raga** (attachment) etc. emotions. It is this that should be contemplated. || 19 ||

In this way, the **Sutragatha** (verse) which was first mentioned in the first place to refute **Buddhamati** (Buddhist philosophy), was explained in detail in the second place in four verses.

##  Verse 20:

**18**
**Panchaastikaya Prabhrut**
**Samaya Vyakhya Gatha-20**

Here, the production of the Siddha from utter non-existence is prohibited. The karmas like knowledge-obscuring, etc., are firmly bound to the Jiva. When these karmas cease to exist, the Siddha becomes unprecedented. ||20||

**Commentary:**

Just as in the case of a bamboo stick, where the vision, having descended to the perfectly pure upper part, after being obstructed by the variegated and diverse rays of light in the lower part, perceives the pervasiveness of the variegated and diverse rays of light everywhere, and concludes that the stick is impure everywhere; similarly, in the case of the Jiva-dravya, the intellect, having descended to the perfectly pure upper part, after being obstructed by the variegated and diverse karmas like knowledge-obscuring, etc., in the lower part, concludes that the Jiva-dravya is impure everywhere. Just as in the case of the bamboo stick, there is a connection of the variegated and diverse rays of light with the illusory knowledge of pervasiveness, so also in the case of the Jiva-dravya, there is a connection of the karmas like knowledge-obscuring, etc., with the variegated and diverse rays of light. Just as in the case of the bamboo stick, the absence of the variegated and diverse rays of light leads to the purity, so also in the case of the Jiva-dravya, the absence of the variegated and diverse karmas like knowledge-obscuring, etc., leads to the attainment of the Siddha-hood, which is defined by the knowledge beyond the senses, obtained through the right understanding of the scriptures. ||20||

**Hindi Samaya Vyakhya Gatha-20**

_Anvayaarth (Jnanaavaranadyaah Bhaavaah)_ Knowledge-obscuring, etc., karmas (Jeevena) are firmly bound to the Jiva (Sushtu) in a good way (Anubaddhaah). (Teshaam Abaavam Krutvaa) By removing them (Abhootpurvaah Siddhah) the Siddha becomes unprecedented (Bhavati).

**Commentary:**

Here, the production of the Siddha from utter non-existence is prohibited.

Just as in the case of a bamboo stick, where the vision, having descended to the perfectly pure upper part, after being obstructed by the variegated and diverse rays of light in the lower part, perceives the pervasiveness of the variegated and diverse rays of light everywhere, and concludes that the stick is impure everywhere; similarly, in the case of the Jiva-dravya, the intellect, having descended to the perfectly pure upper part, after being obstructed by the variegated and diverse karmas like knowledge-obscuring, etc., in the lower part, concludes that the Jiva-dravya is impure everywhere.

**Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas (further explained)**

Just as when one looks at a very long bamboo stick, whose lower half is partially covered and partially uncovered with various colorful paintings, and whose upper half is completely covered and pure (unpainted), the vision, determining the pervasiveness of the colorfulness caused by the various paintings, concludes that "the bamboo is completely impure (i.e., entirely colorful)", similarly, when one applies intellect to a living being whose lower part, very large and filled with variegatedness (various vibhava-paryayas) caused by karma like jnana-avaran, is partially covered and partially uncovered, and whose upper part, very large and pure (siddh-paryaya), is completely covered, the intellect, determining the pervasiveness of the variegatedness caused by karma like jnana-avaran, concludes that "the being is completely impure".

Again, just as the cause of the apparent knowledge of pervasiveness in the bamboo is the continuity (flow) of the colorfulness caused by the various paintings in the lower uncovered part, similarly, the cause of the apparent knowledge of pervasiveness in the living being is the continuity of the variegatedness caused by karma like jnana-avaran in the lower uncovered part. And just as the bamboo is pure (in the upper part) because there is no continuity of the colorfulness caused by the various paintings, similarly, the living being is pure (in the upper part) because there is no continuity of the variegatedness caused by karma like jnana-avaran, which absence is known through the knowledge of the authoritative scriptures, correct inferential knowledge, and extra-sensory perception.

**Commentary on the Sanskrit Meaning of the Verse 20**

Although all beings are pure in their essence according to the dravya-arthic-naya (doctrine of substance), they are not pure in their paryaya (state) according to the paryaya-arthic-naya (doctrine of state). This is because the state of a siddha (liberated being) is not produced. Or, when a human being dies, the same being is reborn as a deva (god). Similarly, when the state of samsara (worldly existence) is destroyed due to the absence of mithyatva (falsehood), raga (attachment), etc., and the state of a siddha is attained, there is no destruction of the being. In both cases, it is the same being. Or, according to the dravya-arthic-paryaya-arthic-naya (doctrine of substance and state), which is relative to each other, the truth is explained as anekanta (multifaceted). Then, the liberation is explained as the shedding of the mithyatva, raga, etc., which are the bonds in the form of jnana-avaran, etc., in the state of samsara, and the attainment of the pure state. Keeping these three points in mind, the sutra (aphorism) is explained:

"The jnana-avaran, etc., are firmly bound to the being. The dravya-karma-paryayas (states of substance and karma) like jnana-acharana, etc., are firmly bound to the samsaric being in the form of a continuous chain from beginningless time."

"When the being attains the three jewels of a-bheda (non-duality), ratna (jewel), and a-jheda (non-destruction), which are obtained through time and effort, and the path of liberation through practical certainty, then the dravya-karma-paryayas (states of substance and karma) like jnana-avaran, etc., are destroyed, and the being becomes a siddha, which is unprecedented according to the paryaya-arthic-naya. According to the dravya-arthic-naya, the being was already a siddha."

**Explanation**

Just as a large bamboo stick has its lower half covered with various colorful paintings, making it impure, and its upper half pure because it is free from those paintings, similarly, when a person named Devadatta looks at it, he mistakenly believes...

Page #77:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

**Panchaastikaya Prabhrit**
73

**Knowing the impurity due to the variegated nature of the body, one considers the upper half of the body to be impure as well. Similarly, this soul, in the state of samsara, remains impure due to the influence of false beliefs, attachment, etc., and their resultant transformations. However, internally, it remains pure in its true nature of omniscience, etc., according to the principle of pure substance. When, being possessed by attachment, etc., it contemplates with the sensory knowledge of the form of discrimination, then just as it sees the external part of itself as impure due to the influence of attachment, etc., it also considers its internal nature of omniscience, etc., to be impure due to false knowledge. Just as the variegated nature of the bamboo stick is the cause of false knowledge, similarly, false beliefs, attachment, etc., are the cause of false knowledge in the soul. Just as the bamboo stick becomes pure when cleansed of the variegated nature, similarly, this soul, when it knows the supreme scripture that reveals the true nature of the pure self in the presence of the gurus, becomes pure. What kind of scripture? "I am one, without ego, pure, knowing, the object of the yogi-indras. All external things, born of association, are always different from me." And so on. Similarly, it knows the inferential knowledge that the body and the soul are completely different, as they are marked by different characteristics, like water and fire. Similarly, it knows the knowledge of self-awareness, free from attachment and discrimination. Thus, from the knowledge of scripture, inference, self-awareness, and perception, it becomes pure. Here, the term "Shuddha Jeevaastikaya" refers to the state of being pure, which is unprecedented and established, and the pure soul substance is the object of consideration.**

**This is the meaning of the 20th verse.**

**Hindi Meaning of the Verse:**

**Verse 20**

**Uththānikā:**  Further, it is shown that although this soul always remains pure according to the principle of pure substance, yet the unprecedented production of the category, which is established according to the principle of category, takes place. In other words, the state of being established, which was never manifested before, is now revealed. Or, it is explained that just as the same soul remains when the human category is destroyed and the divine category is born, similarly, the same soul remains when the category of samsara is destroyed and the category of liberation is born, due to the disappearance of false beliefs and the transformations of attachment, aversion, etc. In other words, the soul is the same in both the state of samsara and the state of liberation. Or, it is said that by understanding the truth through both the aforementioned principles of pure substance and category, which are interdependent, one abandons the false beliefs and the transformations of attachment, etc., which were caused by the bondage of karma, such as knowledge-obscuring karma, etc., and transforms into pure states. This is how one attains liberation. Keeping these three points in mind, the next sutra is explained.

**General Meaning with Anvaya:**

**(Jīveṇa) By this worldly soul, (ṇāṇāvaraṇādīyā) the eight types of karma, such as knowledge-obscuring karma, (bhāṣā) are bound (suṭhu) firmly (aṇubaddhā). By destroying (tesiṁ) all of them (abhāvam kicchā), (abhūdapuavo) unprecedented, i.e., what never happened before, (siddho) becomes established (havadi).

Page #78:
---------------------------
## Six Substances - Description of the Five Astikayas

**Special Meaning:** In this worldly life, from time immemorial, the nature of karmic substances has bound the living being. In other words, eight karmas are always found bound to it in a flowing manner. When a worthy soul, due to the power of the infinite time of liberation, attains the three jewels of knowledge, conduct, and liberation, and the three jewels of certainty, liberation, and non-duality, then, by destroying the substance and the state of being of those karmas like knowledge-obscuring, etc., it becomes a perfected being through the Paryaya-arthicnaya. In other words, it attains the perfected state that was never manifested before. From the perspective of the Dravya-arthicnaya, this living being is already perfected in its essence.

Just like a large bamboo, the first half of which is adorned with various paintings, while the upper half is pure without any intricate designs. When a man named Devadatta sees the painted part with his vision and fails to see the pure part, then, due to his delusional knowledge, he considers the entire bamboo to be impure, adorned with intricate paintings, and assumes the upper half to be impure as well. Similarly, this living being, in the state of the world, is becoming impure through the Paryaya-arthicnaya due to the influence of false beliefs, attachment, aversion, and other subtle influences. However, in its inner nature, it is pure, adorned with perfect knowledge, etc., through the Dravya-arthicnaya. When it contemplates through the power of the mind, which is the form of choice, while undergoing transformation in these influences of attachment, etc., it sees the impure soul in the form of attachment, etc., in the external part, and similarly, even though it possesses the nature of perfect knowledge, etc., within, it considers itself impure due to its deceptive or false knowledge. Just as the mixture of various paintings in the bamboo is the cause of false knowledge, similarly, the false beliefs, attachment, aversion, etc., in this living being are the cause of false knowledge. Just as that bamboo becomes pure when the intricate paintings are washed away, similarly, this living being also becomes pure when it knows the supreme path, which illuminates the pure self-nature, in the presence of the holy gurus, and understands as it is said, "Eko'ham nirmamaḥ śuddho jñānī yogīndragocaraḥ | Bāhyāḥ saṁyoga-jā bhāvā mattaḥ sarve'pi sarvadā ||" (I am one, without any attachment, pure, knowledgeable, the object of the yogis. All the external feelings born of association are always outside my nature). Similarly, it knows through its inferential knowledge that this body, etc., and the soul are completely different because they have different characteristics. Just as water and fire are completely different due to their different characteristics. In the same way, it experiences through the knowledge of non-attachment, non-choice, and self-awareness. Then, through the power of the knowledge of the scriptures, inference, and self-awareness, it becomes pure. Here, the implication is that the pure soul-substance, which is the never-before-manifested perfected state, or the pure Jiva-astikaya, is the one that is worthy of being grasped. || 20 ||

##  Pancastikaya Prabhrut

75. Thus, in the third realm, by the Paryayarthika Nay, the unprecedented Paryaya of Siddha is produced. This explanation is the main point of the gatha.

**Time Explanation Gatha-21**

This is the conclusion of the justification of the Jiva being the cause of its own production, destruction, existence, and non-existence.

**Gatha-21**

Thus, the Jiva, being associated with the Paryayas of its qualities, wanders through existence, creating existence, non-existence, the existence of non-existence, and the non-existence of existence.

**Commentary**

Indeed, it is stated that the substance is always indestructible and unproduced. Therefore, the Jiva substance is said to be eternal in its substance form. (1) It is said to be the cause of existence (production) because it manifests in the form of the Paryaya of Devas, etc. (2) It is said to be the cause of non-existence (destruction) because it manifests in the form of the Paryaya of humans, etc. (3) It is said to be the cause of the existence of non-existence because the Deva, etc. Paryaya, which is existing, begins to be destroyed. (4) It is said to be the cause of the non-existence of existence because the human, etc. Paryaya, which is non-existing, begins to be produced. All this is impeccable because it is explained as the predominance of one or the other quality of the Paryayas of the substance. For example, when the Jiva is considered as the substance with the quality of Paryaya, then it is neither produced nor destroyed, nor does it destroy the existing Paryaya group because of its continuous cycle, nor does it produce the non-existing. But when the substance is considered as the Paryaya with the quality of substance, then it manifests, it is destroyed, it destroys the existing Paryaya group which has exceeded its time, and it produces the non-existing which has not yet come into existence. This is the grace of Anekantavada, where even this apparent contradiction is not a contradiction.

_Anvayarth_ - [Evam] Thus, [guna-paryayaih sahita] associated with the Paryayas of qualities, [jivah] the Jiva, [sansaran] wandering, [bhavam] existence, [abhavam] non-existence, [bhaavaabhav] the existence of non-existence, [cha] and [abhavaabhav] the non-existence of existence, [karoti] does.

_Tika_ - This is the conclusion of the justification of the Jiva being the cause of its own production, destruction, existence, and non-existence.

It is stated in the scriptures that the substance is always indestructible and unproduced. Therefore, the Jiva substance is said to be eternal in its substance form. (1) It is said to be the cause of existence (production) because it manifests in the form of the Paryaya of Devas, etc. (2) It is said to be the cause of non-existence (destruction) because it manifests in the form of the Paryaya of humans, etc.

## 76
The destruction of the six substances and the five astikayas is attributed to the absence (destruction) of the same, because it is obtained. (3) It destroys the existing (present) gods and their equivalents, therefore it is called the doer of the destruction of existence (destruction of the existing). And (4) again, it produces the non-existent (non-existent) humans and their equivalents, therefore it is called the doer of the production of non-existence (production of the non-existent).
- All this is flawless (blameless, unobstructed, uncontradictory) because it is stated from the secondary nature of one of the substances and the primary nature of the other. It is as follows:
When the jiva is intended from the secondary nature of the astikaya and the primary nature of the substance, then it (1) is not produced, (2) is not destroyed, (3) does not function in sequence, therefore it does not destroy the existing (present) group of astikayas and (4) does not produce the non-existent (non-existent group of astikayas). And when the jiva is intended from the secondary nature of the substance and the primary nature of the astikaya, then it (1) is produced, (2) is destroyed, (3) destroys the existing (present) group of astikayas whose time has passed, and (4) produces the non-existent (non-existent group of astikayas) whose time has arrived (has come).
This grace is truly of the Anekantavada, that even such contradiction (truly) is not contradiction. ||21|| Thus, the general description of the six substances is complete.

Page #81:
---------------------------
The meaning is that the soul, due to the cause of the destruction of the existing and the creation of the non-existent *paryaya*, should continuously and with utmost earnestness have right faith, knowledge, and conduct in the pure soul substance. ||21||

Thus, in the fourth place, the *gatha* has been included, mainly for the purpose of explaining the creation and destruction of the soul in the form of a god or human being, even though it is eternal according to the *dravya* theory, but according to the *paryaya* theory. This completes the second *saptaka* with these four places.

Thus, the second *antaradhikari* called *dravya-pithika* in the *mahaadhikari* of *jayabhitta* ends with the five places mentioned in the first *gatha-spataka*, excluding the *jayabhitta* and *aneshalatha*.

**Hindi Meaning:**

The *gatha* 21 further clarifies that the soul is the creator of the destruction of the existing *paryaya* and the creation of the non-existent *paryaya* within itself, and also explains this concept.

**General Meaning with Anvaya:**

In this way, the soul, along with its qualities and *paryayas*, wanders in the world, creating and destroying, initiating the absence of the existing *paryaya* and the presence of the non-existent *paryaya*.

**Specific Meaning:**

As we have already said, the soul is eternal according to the *dravya* theory, but according to the *paryaya* theory, it destroys the existing human *paryaya* and then creates the god *paryaya* at the time of birth in the heavenly realm. Even then, at the time of the end of the god *paryaya*, it initiates the destruction of the existing god *paryaya* and the creation of the non-existent human *paryaya* at the time of birth in the human realm. The soul that does this is accompanied by qualities like wrong knowledge, etc., and *paryayas* like human, hellish, etc. The soul that is accompanied by natural qualities like perfect knowledge, etc., and the pure *paryaya* of the liberated soul, does not wander in this way, because the creation of human, hellish, etc., *paryayas* is impossible when the light of perfect knowledge, etc., is present. However, even in the pure liberated soul *paryaya*, the soul continues to create and destroy, etc., due to the qualities of heavy and light, in relation to the six-fold *paryaya* of the nature of gain and loss. There is no contradiction in this. When the soul is impure, it wanders in the world in the form of five types: substance, field, time, existence, and state. This *sutra* shows that when the soul attains the pure soul substance in the form of pure knowledge, vision, and nature, it should have right faith, knowledge, and conduct in the form of the three jewels of certainty, which is the supreme *samayik*.

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

A being who does not perceive, hear, or experience the four types of knowledge - food, fear, sexual intercourse, and possessions - and who is deluded, confused, or attached to the results of all influences, is constantly born and destroyed in the various categories of beings like humans and hell beings. Such a being should strive to maintain pure soul substance, right faith, knowledge, and experience or meditation, so that there is no wandering in the realms of influence. This is the meaning. || 21 ||

In this way, although the substances are eternal according to the substance-based perspective, according to the category-based perspective, this worldly being is the creator and destroyer of the categories of beings like gods and humans. This explanation is mainly due to the contraction of the fourth stage, and the chapter is complete. In this way, the second set of seven chapters is completed with four stages. Thus, the second internal chapter called "Dravyapithika" in the first great chapter is completed with fourteen chapters, including the five stages mentioned in the first set of seven chapters and nine internal stages.

## Time Commentary Verse - 22

Here, among the six substances whose characteristics have been generally described, the five are established as Astikayas. The soul, the pudgala, the space, and the remaining two Astikayas are non-created, existentially real, and are the cause of the world. || 22 ||

## Hindi Time Commentary Verse - 22

Anvayaartha - [ Jeevaah ] Soul ( Pugalakaayaah ) Pudgala ( Aakaasam ) Space and [ Shesh Astikaya ] the remaining two Astikayas ( Amayaah ) are non-created, ( Astitvamyaah ) existentially real, and ( hi ) truly ( Lokasya Kaaranabhootaaah ) are the cause of the world.

Tika - Here (in this verse), among the six substances whose nature has been (previously) described, five are established as Astikayas.

Because they are non-created, existentially real, and the cause of the diversely evolving world, it is accepted that among the six substances, the soul, pudgala, space, dharma, and adharma are Astikayas. Time is not an Astikaya because it does not exist. This is understood through the power of reasoning. || 122 ||

Page #83:
---------------------------
The five Astikayas are: Jiva, Pudgala, Akasa, Dharma and Adharma. These are accepted (Sammat) because they are not created (Akrit), they exist (Astitvamya) and they are caused by the Lokas which are of various types and are their culmination. The five Astikayas are characterized by being composed of a collection of Pradeshas (Pradeshaprachayatmak). Time (Kal) is not composed of a collection of Pradeshas, therefore it is not an Astikaya. This is certain (Nischita) by inference (Samarthya). ||22||

Page #84:
---------------------------
## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas with Anvaya and General Meaning:

(Jiva) Infinite Jivas (Puggala-kaya) Infinite Puggala-kayas (Aayasam) One Akasa (Sesa Astikaiya) The remaining two Astikayas, Dharma and Adharma, are the substances. These five Astikayas (Amaya) are not created, (Asthitt-maya) they exist by their own nature, and (Hi) certainly (Logass) are the (Karanabhuuda) cause of this Lok.

## Specific Meaning:

Jiva and the other five Astikayas are not created by any particular person. They exist by their own nature and are therefore present. This Lok is a combination of these five Astikayas, a space without a body, and the substance of time, making a total of six substances. As it is said, "Jivaadi-shad-dravyaanam samavaayo melapako lokah". This Lok is characterized by creation, destruction, and permanence. This is how the existence of this Lok is observed, as it is said, "Utpada-vyaya-dhrauvya-yuktam sat iti". This Lok has three parts: above, middle, and below. It is also made up of many parts and is therefore called "bahu-pradeshi" or "kaya-pana". This is the meaning of the sutra.

## Conclusion:

This way, the information about the five Astikayas, Jiva and the others, being among the six substances is conveyed, and the verse is completed.

## Time Explanation:

## Verse 23:

Even though time is not mentioned as an Astikaya, its existence is implied. The Jivas and Puggala are characterized by their existence and nature. Time, born from change, is defined by rule.

## Explanation:

Since Jivas and Puggala exist by their own nature, there is a continuous change in them, characterized by creation, destruction, and permanence. This change is observed in the presence of the cause of cooperation. It is like the change in motion, stillness, understanding, and transformation. The cause of cooperation is time. Since this change cannot be explained without time, it is certain that time exists even though it is not mentioned. The time used in everyday life is synonymous with the definite time. It is understood to be dependent on the change in Jivas and Puggala, as it is manifested by them.

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Pañcāstikāya Prābhṛta
Commentary on the Verse 23 of the Samayasāra - Meaning of the Verse (sattāsvabhāvānām) Of the beings (jīvānām tathā eva pudgalānām ca) as well as the matter (pudgalānām), the time (kālaḥ) that is produced by (parivarttanasambhūtaḥ) the transformation is (niyamena prajñaptaḥ) ascertained by the omniscient ones.

Explanation - Even though the time (kāla) is not explicitly mentioned as an astikāya (substance), its existence is established here. In this world, the beings (jīvas) and the matter (pudgalas) are constantly undergoing transformation (utpādavyayadhrauvya) due to their intrinsic nature (sattāsvabhāva). This transformation is like the motion, stability, and penetration. This transformation, which is the cooperative cause, is known as time (kāla). Even though the time (kāla) is not explicitly mentioned, it is established to exist in the form of substance, as it is necessary for the transformation of the jīvas and pudgalas. The conventional time, which is in the form of moments (samaya) and hours (ghaṭikā), is known through the transformation of the jīvas and pudgalas, and hence, it is considered to be dependent on them.

## Description of the Six Substances - Five Astikayas

Just as the thread-bundle is the material cause of the cloth, which is produced by the cause of the cloth, and the rice, etc., is the material cause of the cooked rice, etc., which is produced by the cause of the cooked rice, etc., similarly, the living being is the material cause of the body, etc., which is produced by the cause of the body, etc. || 23 ||

**Hindi Meaning Commentary Verse - 23**

Further, it is said that in the context of the five Astikayas, even though the time substance is not mentioned by name, it is still obtained by the power of the context of the five Astikayas.

**General Meaning with Anvaya**

(Sabbhavasabhavanaam) Those who possess the nature of being (jivaanam) living beings, (tah ya poggalaanam) similarly, the particles, (cha) and other dharma, adharma, and space, (pariyattan sambhudo) the cause of their transformation, (niyamen) is definitely (kaalo) the time substance (pannatto) is said to be.

**Specific Meaning**

The transformation or change from new to old of substances is called transformation. The cause of this is the time substance. This is what the omniscient God has said. Here, the student doubts that this is a discussion of the Patanika, or whether this is a discussion of the five Astikayas, and even though the time substance is not mentioned, it should be understood by implication. How is this proven? The Acharya answers that these five Astikayas, including the living being, are constantly transforming. This transformation results in a transformed or changed form. This transformed form depends on its cause. Although the power of the material cause is inherent in the substances themselves to transform, there is a need for an efficient cause. Therefore, the time substance, in the form of the time atom, is the efficient cause of the transformation of substances. It is by the power of this logic that the time substance is revealed.

The student then presents this counter-argument: The subtle time, which is produced by the movement of the particle atoms, is called the definite time. The gross time, which is in the form of hours, minutes, etc., is called the practical time. This practical time is produced by the actions of men, such as filling water, making vessels, clothes, and wood, which are the efficient causes of hours, minutes, etc. There is no practical time from the time substance.

The Acharya answers this by saying that although the subtle practical time, in the form of time, is revealed by the slow movement of the particle atoms, and the gross practical time, in the form of hours, minutes, etc., is known by the actions of the substances, such as water, vessels, clothes, etc., which are the efficient causes of hours, minutes, etc., nevertheless, the practical time, which is in the form of time or hours, minutes, etc., is the material cause of the time substance, in the form of the time atom. This is what we should believe.

Page #87:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Panchaastikaya** is derived from the principle that the effect is similar to the material cause. Just as a pot, the effect, is formed by the external instrumental causes like the potter, wheel, and cloth, its material cause is the lump of clay. Similarly, a cloth, the effect, is formed by the external instrumental causes like the weaver, loom, thread, and shuttle, its material cause is the bundle of threads. Likewise, cooked rice, the effect, is produced by the external instrumental causes like fuel and fire, its material cause is rice or paddy. Or, the effect of the cycle of birth and death, like human or hellish beings, is caused by the arising of karma, its material cause is the soul. In the same way, the **time** that is manifested by the specific actions of objects is the **time-atom** (**Kalaanu**), the material cause of the **definite time** (**Nischya Kala**).

**Time Explanation Verse 24:**

**Time** is devoid of five colors and five tastes, devoid of two smells and eight touches, it is neither heavy nor light, it is formless, and it is characterized by change.

**Hindi Explanation of Verse 24:**

**Time** (**Nischya Kala**) is devoid of five colors and five tastes, devoid of two smells and eight touches, it is neither heavy nor light, it is formless, and it is characterized by change.

**Sanskrit Explanation of Verse 24:**

This verse further explains the nature of **definite time**. It is devoid of five colors, five tastes, two smells, and eight touches. It is neither heavy nor light, it is formless, and it is characterized by change. This **time-atom** (**Kalaanu**) is the material cause of **definite time**. It is like the wheel of a potter, which rotates continuously, and the fire that helps in the process of learning. It is like the stone beneath the wheel, which supports the wheel's rotation. It is the external cause of change. 

**Note:** The translation preserves the Jain terms like **Panchaastikaya**, **Kalaanu**, and **Nischya Kala**.

## Six Substances - Description of the Five Astikayas

Just as a potter's wheel moves everywhere, and just as when a touch is applied to one part of the body, the sense of taste experiences pleasure throughout the entire body, and just as when a snake bites one part of the body, pain is felt throughout the entire body, similarly, even though it is present in the midst of the world, the time substance pervades the entire universe. Why? Because it is an indivisible substance. The time substance is the contributory cause of the transformation of other substances. What is the contributory cause of the transformation of time? Just as space is the support of space, and just as the light of knowledge, the sun, and the moon illuminate themselves and others, similarly, time itself is the contributory cause of the transformation of the time substance.

Some may argue that just as the time substance is itself the contributory cause of its own transformation, so too all other substances will be the contributory cause of their own transformation, and what is the purpose of the time substance? To address this, we say that the property of being the contributory cause of the transformation of all substances is unique to time. How is this so? Just as space provides space for all, and just as the dharma substance is the cause of motion for all, similarly, dharma is the cause of the state of being for all. How is this so? The qualities of one substance cannot be transferred to another substance, as this would lead to the defect of mixing and interference.

Furthermore, if all substances are the contributory cause of their own transformation, just as they are the material cause of their own transformation, then what is the purpose of the dharma, adharma, and space substances in the transformation of motion, state of being, and understanding? Motion, state of being, and understanding will occur on their own. If this is the case, then what is the fault in the two substances called the jiva and the pudgala? This would contradict the scriptures.

Here, the pure jivas, whose nature is pure perception-knowledge, have been exhausted in the cycle of existence for an infinite period of time due to the absence of the astikaya of the pure jiva. Therefore, having attained the state of freedom from attachment and the state of equanimity, and having abandoned all attachment, thoughts, and the waves of mental fluctuations, the jiva should constantly meditate on this. This is the meaning.

This is the explanation of the time of certainty, which is the main theme of these two verses.

**Hindi Meaning:**

The five colors and five tastes are absent. The two smells and eight touches are absent. It is subtle due to its formlessness and is not perceptible to the senses. It is characterized by its nature of being a flow. This is the time substance.

**Specific Meaning:**

This formless time substance is the cause of the transformation of all substances. Just as fire is the contributory cause for a man reading in the winter, or just as the stone below is the contributory cause for a potter's wheel spinning, similarly, the time substance, which is characterized by its nature of being a flow, is the external cause of the transformation of all substances that are transforming on their own. This is the time of certainty.

Page #89:
---------------------------
The disciple asked, "If time substance is not outside the space substance, then how will the space substance outside transform?" The Acharya replied, "Just as by moving one part of a long rope, the whole rope moves, or by touching one part of the body with the sense of touch, or by tasting with the tongue, the whole body experiences pleasure, or by biting one part of a snake, the whole body experiences pain, similarly, even though time substance is within the space substance, it is the cause of transformation of the entire space substance because space is a single, undivided substance."

The second question was, "If time substance is the cooperative cause in the transformation of other substances, then what is the cooperative cause of the transformation of time substance?" The solution is, "Just as space is the basis of space, knowledge, light, and a lamp are self-illuminating, similarly, time itself is the cooperative cause of the transformation of time substance." Then the disciple asked, "If time substance is the cooperative cause of its own transformation, then all substances will become the cooperative cause of their own transformation, and there will be no use of time substance."

The solution is, "The ability of all substances to be the cooperative cause in their general transformation is a quality of time. Just as the quality of space is to provide space for all, the quality of dharma substance is to be the cause of movement for all, and the quality of adharma substance is to be the cooperative cause of stillness for all. This is because the qualities of one substance cannot be made into the qualities of another substance. If this were to happen, there would be the fault of mixture and interference. If all substances were to become the cooperative cause while being the material cause of their own transformation, then there would be no use of dharma, adharma, and space substances in the actions of movement, stillness, and absorption. Movement, stillness, and absorption would happen on their own. If this were to happen, it would be a fault because only the jiva and pudgala substances would remain. This would contradict the scriptures. The meaning here is that this jiva, who is inherently pure knowledge and perception, and who is the pure jiva-astikaya, has been wandering in the cycle of existence for an infinite time. Therefore, now it should remain in the state of vitraga nirvikalpa samadhi, abandoning all waves of attachment and aversion, and constantly meditate on that pure jiva."

Thus, two verses are completed, mainly focusing on the explanation of time.

## Chapter 86: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

**Verse 25: Explanation of Time**

Time, moment, *kaṣṭhā*, *kalā*, *nālī*, then day and night. Month, season, solstice, and year - this is time, dependent on others.

**Commentary:**

Here, the dependence of practical time is shown.

Time is dependent on the movement of atoms. A moment is dependent on the blinking of the eye. *Kaṣṭhā*, *kalā*, and *nālī* are specific quantities of moments. Day and night are dependent on the movement of the celestial bodies. Month, season, solstice, and year are specific quantities of day and night.

Such practical time cannot be understood as merely a synonym for time, as it is dependent on other things. Therefore, it is described as "dependent."

**Hindi Explanation of Verse 25:**

(Time) Time, (moment) moment, (*kaṣṭhā*) *kaṣṭhā*, (*kalā*) *kalā*, (*nālī*) *nālī*. (Then day and night) day and night, (day), (month, season, and year) month, season, and year. (This is time) such time (i.e., practical time) (dependent on others) is dependent on others.

**Commentary:**

Here, the dependence of practical time is shown.

Time is dependent on the movement of atoms. A moment is dependent on the blinking of the eye. From a specific number of moments, *kaṣṭhā*, *kalā*, and *nālī* are formed. Day and night are dependent on the movement of the sun. From a specific number of day and night, month, season, solstice, and year are formed.

Such practical time cannot be understood as merely a synonym for time, as it is dependent on other things. Therefore, it is described as "dependent."

**Sanskrit Meaning and Explanation of Verse 25:**

Now, in determining time and other practical time, the true meaning of time is also revealed through the transformation of the soul, the *pudgala*, and the *bhavana*. This shows that it is dependent on other things.

*Samaya* - Time is manifested by the *pudgala* atoms that have undergone slow transformation.

*Nimisa* - A moment is manifested by the blinking of the eye. It is a time beyond numbers.

*Kaṣṭhā* - Fifteen *nimisa* make a *kaṣṭhā*.

*Kalā* - Thirty *kaṣṭhā* make a *kalā*.

*Nālī* - Twenty-four *kalā* make a *muhūrta* (two *muhūrta* make a *ghaṭikā*).

*Then day and night* - Thirty *muhūrta* make a day and night.

*Month* - Twenty days make a month.

*Season* - Two *udgāsa* make a season.

*Solstice* - A solstice is caused by a season.

*Year* - Two solstices make a year.

The word "iti" indicates that practical time is to be understood as a metaphor, a simile, or an analogy. It is manifested by the slow transformation of the *pudgala* atoms, the *ghaṭikā* is manifested by the *pudgala* that is the cause of the water clock, and the day and night are manifested by the specific actions of the sun's movement.

The time of practical affairs is based on the five-fold divisions (of time). How is it so? The lump of clay, which is produced by external factors like the potter, etc., is dependent on others, and is said to be dependent on others, being subject to others, even though it is generated by the time of substance. Moreover, it is defined by specific actions like the movement of the sun, etc., and is the cause of the definition of another's birth, etc. That same time is different from the time of substance. Not so. The time of practical affairs, which is defined by the movement of the sun, etc., which is synonymous with the previously mentioned time, etc., is the cause of the time of substance, which is defined by the movement of the sun, etc. 

Now, if the substance of dharma is the co-operative cause of the movement of the sun, etc., what is the purpose of time? Not so. The substance of dharma is the co-operative cause of the movement, and the substance of time also has many co-operative causes. Just as the potter, wheel, cloth, etc., are the causes of the creation of a pot, just as water, etc., are the causes of fish, etc., just as a cart, etc., are the causes of humans, just as mantras, medicines, etc., are the causes of the knowledge of the celestial beings, just as a chariot is the cause of the gods, etc., so too is the substance of time the cause of movement. Where is it said? It is said further, "The living beings, who are the bodies of the poggala, are active due to the time-making."

Now, if the time taken to cross one region by a single atom is the definition of time, then how many regions are crossed in the time of fourteen rajjus, which is one time? Not so. The generation of time, which is said to be due to the crossing of one region, is said to be due to slow movement, and the crossing of fourteen rajjus, which is said to be one time, is said to be due to fast movement. There is no fault in this. An example is given here: Just as a certain Devadatta travels one hundred yojanas in one hundred days, and he travels one hundred yojanas in one day due to the power of knowledge, so too, in the case of fast movement, the crossing of fourteen rajjus in one time is not a fault.

Page #92:
---------------------------
The description of the six substances and the five astikayas is as follows: A month is made up of two months, a season is made up of three months, an ayan is made up of three seasons, a year is made up of two ayans, and so on. One should know the practical time periods like palya, upam, sagar, etc. Time is that which manifests from the subtle particles of pudgala, which are in a state of slow motion. A ghadi is that which manifests from the action of pudgala, which is external and instrumental, like a vessel of water. A day, etc., is that which manifests from the specific action of the sun's orb, like its movement, etc. Just as a pot, which is produced by external instrumental causes like a potter's wheel, etc., is born from the material cause, which is a lump of clay, similarly, this practical time is born from the subtle particles of time, but it is dependent on the movement of the moon, etc., as its instrumental cause. Here, someone may doubt that time is that which is known by the specific action of others, i.e., by the movement of the sun, etc., and which is the cause of knowing other things that have been produced. There is no other substance or definite time. The answer to this is that it is not so. The time that manifests from the movement of the sun, etc., which is a synonym of the previously mentioned evidence, is practical time, but the time that is a cooperative cause in the movement of the sun, etc., is the substance time or definite time. Then the doubter says that dharma substance is a cooperative cause in the movement, etc., of the sun. What is the role of time substance here? The Acharya answers that it is not so. Just as dharma substance is a cooperative cause in the movement, so is time substance. There can be many cooperative causes. For example, in the production of a pot, there are many causes like the potter, the wheel, the chisel, etc., and for fish, there is water, etc., and for humans, there is a cart, etc., and for students, there are mantras, medicines, etc., and for gods, there are vehicles for movement, etc., which are cooperative causes. Similarly, time substance is also a cooperative cause in movement. It has been said somewhere that the skandhas made from pudgala and the living being along with pudgala are active only because of time. This will be discussed further. The doubter doubts that the time taken by a pudgala particle to cross a region is time. It has been said that the same particle travels fourteen rajus in the same time. How can the same time be taken when it crosses fourteen rajus, which are equal to fourteen regions? The Acharya resolves this by saying that it is not so. When a particle crosses a region while moving slowly, one time is produced. The same particle crosses fourteen rajus in the same time, but it does so at a faster speed. This is what has been said, so there is no fault in this. There are no divisions of time. An example is given here. A man named Devadatta travels one hundred yojanas in one hundred days at a slow speed. If he travels with the power of knowledge,

Page #93:
---------------------------
If one were to travel to the Panchaastikaya in a day, one would say it took a hundred days, but in reality, it takes only one day. Similarly, when traveling at high speed, even fourteen Rajus can be traversed in a single moment, there is no fault in this.

**Time Explanation Verse 26**

Neither long nor short is without measure, indeed, it is measure.
Without the pudgala substance, therefore, time is dependent on perception.

**Commentary:**

Here, the dependence of practical time on something else is explained well.
Firstly, in practical time, like the blink of an eye, there is the perception of "long" and "short". This perception is indeed dependent on the measure of long and short time, which is not possible without that measure. And that measure is not determined without the transformation of the pudgala substance. Therefore, because practical time is known through the transformation of something else, although it is not dependent on anything else in terms of certainty, it is said to be dependent on perception.

Here, in the general description of the Panchaastikaya, although it is not directly mentioned because of its nature as the Panchaastikaya, it is certain that it is dependent on the transformation of the jiva and pudgala, and therefore, it is practical time, dependent on that transformation. It is understood that time, like the Panchaastikaya, has transformed into the form of the world, from a very subtle perspective.

Thus, the section on the general explanation of the Panchaastikaya, which is part of the explanation of time, is complete.

**Hindi Explanation of Verse 26**

Meaning: (Chiram va kshipram) "Chiram" or such knowledge (long time or other time, such knowledge) (matrarahitam tu) without measure (without measure of time) (na asti) does not exist, (sa matra api) and that measure (khulu) truly (pudgaladravyena vina) without the pudgala substance does not exist, (tasmat) therefore (kalah pratitibhavah) time (practical time) is dependent on perception.

Commentary: Here, the truth about the dependence of practical time on something else is explained.

Firstly, in practical time, like the blink of an eye, there is the perception of "long" and "short" (long time and short time, such knowledge). That knowledge is truly dependent on the measure of long and short time, which is not possible without that measure. And that measure is not determined without the transformation of the pudgala substance. Therefore, because practical time is known through the transformation of something else, although it is not dependent on anything else in terms of certainty, it is said to be dependent on perception.

## Six Substances and Five Astikayas Explained

Therefore, although there is no direct statement here about the general form of Astikaya due to the absence of Astikaya in the time-cycle, it can be known with very sharp vision that the definite time, which is proven by the non-existence of other possibilities of the results of Jiva and Pudgala, and the practical time, which is definitely dependent on the results of the former, are transformed into the form of the world, like the five Astikayas. || 26 ||

Thus ends the preface in the form of a general explanation of the six substances and five Astikayas in the commentary called "Time Explanation".

**Verse 26 of the Sanskrit Tatparya Vritti**

Now, in the previous verse, it was stated that the practical time is somehow dependent on the ultimate reality. How is this possible? This is explained in the following:

"Natthi" means "not there", "not existing". What is "Chira" (long) or "Kshrip" (short)? "Chira" is the form of a longer duration, "Kshrip" is the form of a shorter duration. How is this? "Matta-rahiya" means "without measure", "without quantity", "without specific value". The quantity denoted by the word "Matra" (measure) is the duration of "Chira" (long) like "Ghatika" (hour), "Prahara" (watch), etc. The quantity denoted by the word "Matra" (measure) for "Kshrip" (short) is the duration of "Sookshma Kala" (subtle time). What is this? It is like "Samaya Avali" (sequence of time).

"The measure of "Sookshma Kala" (subtle time) like "Samaya" (time) etc., without the Pudgala substance, is not known. Similarly, the measure like "Ghatika" (hour) etc., of "Chira Kala" (long time), without the Pudgala substance, which is the cause of the subtle time, is not known. Similarly, the measure like "Ghatika" (hour) etc., of "Chira Kala" (long time), without the substance like the water vessel, which is the cause of "Ghatika" (hour), is not known. Therefore, due to this reason, the practical time, which is in the form of "Samaya" (time), "Ghatika" (hour), "Sookshma" (subtle), and "Sthula" (gross), although it is a synonym of the definite time, is said to be born, produced, by depending on and taking the Pudgala substance like atoms, water, etc., as the cause."

What is the example? Just as a pot, although it is born from the Pudgala mass as the material cause, is said to be made by the potter because it is born from the potter as the efficient cause, similarly, the practical time like "Samaya" (time) etc., although it is born from the ultimate time as the material cause, is said to be born from Pudgala because it is manifested, made known, by the Pudgala substance like atoms, water, etc., which are the cause of "Samaya" (time) and "Ghatika" (hour).

Again, someone may say, "There is only the ultimate time in the form of "Maya" (illusion), and there is no other time in the form of substance."

To this, the refutation is given: "Samaya" (time) is known as "Sookshma Kala" (subtle time), and this is a synonym, not a substance. How is it a synonym? Because it is born and destroyed. The scripture says, "Samayo Uppanna-Paddhansi" (Time is born and destroyed). A synonym cannot exist without a substance, and a substance is eternally indestructible. Therefore, the substance of time, which is the material cause of the synonym of time, is the time substance itself, not Pudgala etc. Why is this? Because the effect is similar to the material cause, just as a pot, which is the effect, is born from the clay mass, which is the material cause.

Furthermore, the specific time itself is the one that denotes the ultimate time and establishes, proves, the form of the ultimate time, which is its own denotation. How is this? Just as the word "Simha" (lion) denotes the lion, the word "Sarvajña" (omniscient) denotes the omniscient, the word "Indra" (Indra) denotes Indra, and so on.

Again, the form of the definite time and the practical time is explained in the form of a conclusion. For example, although the time, which is the material cause, is the same for the subtle practical time like "Samaya" (time) and the gross practical time like "Ghatika" (hour), it is devoid of the distinction of practical time, which is intended in the form of "Samaya" (time) and "Ghatika" (hour), and it is established in the three times, without beginning and end, ...

21
The ultimate time is in the form of the substance of the infinitesimal particles of the space-like region, beginning with the five-astikayas. However, the time that is to be understood as the form of the practical time, such as the moment, day, etc., is the practical time, because it is dependent on the infinitesimal particles of the substance, such as water vessels, etc., which are generated by the fire of the cause of the definitive time. This explanation implies that in this infinite time, the yogis who are the life of the five-astikayas should have firm faith in the one time nature of knowledge and bliss, distinct knowledge of the form of the five-astikayas, distinct from passion, etc., and a steady mind by abandoning the entire network of thoughts and doubts in the form of passion, etc., and should remain in that state. ||26|| Thus, two verses have been devoted to the explanation of practical time. In this first great chapter, which includes the explanation of the six substances of the five-astikayas, the explanation of the definitive and practical time has been explained in three places in five verses.
Thus, the five-astikaya pithika is completed with twenty-six verses in three chapters, namely the time-word pithika, the substance pithika, and the explanation of the definitive and practical time.
Hindi meaning of verse 26:
In the previous verses, the practical time has been said to be dependent on something. How is it dependent? Let us understand this with logic.
General meaning with analysis:
Without measure or quantity, there is no practical time, whether it is long or short. Certainly, that measure also does not exist without the substance of the pudgala. Therefore, time is said to be caused by the pudgala.
Specific meaning:
Long time is called chira and short time is called kshipra. In the world, the practical time of chira or kshipra cannot be without a limit. When we call the time of a ghadi, prahar, etc., chira, then the time smaller than that is called kshipra. The subtle time is a time that is not known without the infinitesimal particles of the pudgala, which are changing slowly. The time that is just a nimisha is not known without the blinking of the eye. Chira time, ghadi, etc., are not known without the substance of water vessels, etc., which are the cause of ghatika, etc. Therefore, the practical time, whether subtle or gross, in the form of ghatika, etc., is a synonym of the time substance in the definitive sense, but in practice, it is said to be generated by the substance of the pudgala, such as the infinitesimal particles and water, etc., as its support or cause. Just as a pot, which is generated from the substance of the earth in the form of a pudgala lump in the definitive sense, is said to be made by the potter in practice because it is made by the potter, similarly, the practical time, such as time, etc., is generated from the pudgala in practice because it is manifested by the infinitesimal particles, which are the cause of time, or by the water, etc., which are the cause of ghatika, etc., although it is generated from the ultimate time substance in the definitive sense. Then someone said...

**Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**

At the time of describing the transactional time, is there no substance in the form of the definitive time, the time atom? To this, the Acharya says that time is a synonym known as the most subtle form of time, it is not a substance. It is a synonym because time arises and perishes. It is said, "Time arises and perishes." A synonym cannot exist without a substance. A substance is definitely imperishable, therefore, the time atom in the form of the substance is the causal basis of the time synonym, not the pudgala, etc. Because it is a rule that the effect is like the causal basis, just as a lump of clay will be, so will the pot made from it be similar to its causal basis. And what else? The word "time" itself, being the denoter of the ultimate time, establishes the nature of its own denotation, the ultimate time. Just as the word "lion" proves the lion substance, the word "omniscient" proves the omniscient substance, and the word "Indra" proves the Indra substance. Still, while being hesitant, the nature of definitive and transactional time is explained.

The subtle transactional time, in the form of time, etc., and the gross transactional time, in the form of hours, etc., whatever their causal basis may be, and which is devoid of the conceptualization of transactional time due to the distinction of time, hours, etc., and which is the distinct substance in the form of countless time atoms, the measure of countless regions of the infinite space of the endless lokas, existing in all three times, is the definitive time. And that which, though born from the causal basis of the definitive time, manifests itself in the pudgala atom, water vessel, etc., is the transactional time, which comes into the conceptualization of specific transactions in the form of time, hours, days, etc. The implication of this explanation is that one should have complete faith in the pure jiva astikaya, which has been rare in the infinite past, in its single nature of pure bliss, and one should know it to be different from attachment, etc., and attain the knowledge of distinction, and in it alone, one should remain steadfast, abandoning the net of all thoughts and choices, which are the forms of attachment, etc.

In this way, two chapters are completed, mainly due to the explanation of transactional time.

In the first great chapter, which describes the five astikayas and the six substances, with eight internal chapters, the third internal chapter is completed with five chapters, through three locations, which speak of the definitive and transactional time. In this way, the preface is completed with thirty-six chapters, through three internal chapters, mainly due to the explanations of the time word-preface, the substance preface, and the definitive and transactional time.

**Panchaastikaya Prabhrut**
**Samaya Vyakhya Gatha - 27**

Now, a special explanation of these (the six substances and the five astikayas) is given. First, the explanation of the jiva astikaya.

**Anvayaartha:** (Jiva iti bhavati) The soul is a jiva, (chetayita) a knower, (upayogavisesita) characterized by its function, (prabhu) a lord, (karta) a doer, (bhokta) an enjoyer, (dehamaatra) limited to the body, (na hi moorta) not material, (cha) and (karmasamyukta) connected with karma.

**Tika:** Here (in this gatha), the sopadhi and nirupadhi nature of the soul in the state of samsara is described.

The soul is called 'jiva' because it holds the life principle (bhavaprana) in reality, and because it holds the material life principle (dravya prana) in practice. It is called 'chetayita' (knower) because it is essentially consciousness (chit) in reality, and because it has the power of consciousness (chichhakti) in practice. It is called 'upayogavisesita' (characterized by its function) because it is marked by its function, which is the manifestation of consciousness (chaitanyaparinamalakshana), in practice, and because it is distinct from the body. It is called 'prabhu' (lord) because it is the master of its own actions (bhavakarma) in reality, and because it is the master of its own material actions (dravya karma) in practice, in the binding, covering, shedding, and liberation of karma. It is called 'karta' (doer) because it is the doer of the soul's transformations (atmaparinama) caused by karmic actions (paugalikakarma) in reality, and because it is the doer of karmic actions (paugalikakarma) caused by the soul's transformations (atmaparinama) in practice. It is called 'bhokta' (enjoyer) because it is the enjoyer of the happiness and sorrow (sukhaduhkhaparinama) caused by good and bad karma (shubhaashubhakarma) in reality, and because it is the enjoyer of the desired and undesired objects (ishtaanishtavishaya) obtained by good and bad karma (shubhaashubhakarma) in practice. It is called 'dehamaatra' (limited to the body) because it is limited to the body in practice, although it is capable of experiencing the world (lokamaatra) and has the power to transform itself (visishtavagahparinama shakti), and because it resides in a body (sharira) made of atoms (anu) and is large (mahach). It is called 'na hi moorta' (not material) because it is not material in reality, although it is material (moorta) in practice, because it is united with karma (karmabhi sahaiktatvaparinam). It is called 'karmasamyukta' (connected with karma) because it is connected with karma (karmabhi samyuktatva) in reality, because it is connected with karma (karmabhi samyuktatva) through the soul's transformations (chaitanyaparinam) that are in accordance with the karmic transformations (pulaparinama), and because it is connected with karma (karmabhi samyuktatva) in practice, because it is connected with the karmic transformations (pulaparinama) that are in accordance with the soul's transformations (chaitanyaparinam).

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

**The Soul (Jiva)** is **"Chetayita"** (conscious) in practice, due to its possession of the power of consciousness. It is **"Upayogalakshata"** (marked by use) in certainty, due to being perceived through the use of its inherent nature as a conscious entity. It is **"Upayogalakshata"** (marked by use) in practice, due to being perceived through the use of its inherent nature as a conscious entity. It is **"Prabhu"** (Lord) in certainty, due to being the self-sufficient cause of the inflow (Asrava), bondage (Bandha), restraint (Samvara), outflow (Nirjara), and liberation (Moksha) of the karmic activities (Bhavakarma). It is **"Prabhu"** (Lord) in practice, due to being the self-sufficient cause of the inflow (Asrava), bondage (Bandha), restraint (Samvara), outflow (Nirjara), and liberation (Moksha) of the karmic activities (Dravyakarma). It is **"Karta"** (Doer) in certainty, due to being the agent of the soul-modifications (Atmaparinam) that are the cause of the karmic activities (Paugalikakarma). It is **"Karta"** (Doer) in practice, due to being the agent of the soul-modifications (Atmaparinam) that are the cause of the karmic activities (Paugalikakarma). It is **"Bhokta"** (Experiencer) in certainty, due to being the experiencer of the pleasant and unpleasant modifications (Sukhaduhkhaparinam) that are the result of the auspicious and inauspicious karmic activities (Shubhashubhakarma). It is **"Bhokta"** (Experiencer) in practice, due to being the experiencer of the desired and undesired objects (Istanisht) obtained through the auspicious and inauspicious karmic activities (Shubhashubhakarma). It is **"Dehpraman"** (Body-proof) in practice, due to residing in the small and large bodies created by the name karma, even though it is the proof of the world (Lokpraman) and possesses the power of specific perception (Vishistavagahaparinam). It is **"Amurta"** (Formless) in certainty, due to its formless nature, even though it becomes manifest in practice due to the unity modification (Ekatvaparinam) with the karmic activities (Karma). It is **"Karmasanyukta"** (Combined with Karma) in certainty, due to being combined with the karmic activities (Bhavakarma) of the conscious modifications (Chaitanyaparinam) in accordance with the matter modifications (Pudgalaparinam). It is **"Karmasanyukta"** (Combined with Karma) in practice, due to being combined with the karmic activities (Karma) of the matter modifications (Pudgalaparinam) in accordance with the conscious modifications (Chaitanyaparinam). ||27||

**Verse 27 of the Sanskrit Commentary (Tatparyavrittigaatha)**

Now, a detailed explanation of the aforementioned six substances is given in the form of a summary. Thus:

"The Soul (Jiva) and Matter (Pudgala) are the two substances that undergo modifications (Parinam), while the remaining four substances (Dharma, Adharma, Akasha, Kala) are not subject to modifications, as they are merely the means of manifestation (Vibhava) and indication (Vyachana). The Soul (Jiva), in the pure certainty (Shuddhanishchayanaya), is pure consciousness (Shuddhachaitanya) and is called "Prana" (Life) due to its nature of pure knowledge and perception (Shuddhajnandarshan). Therefore, it is called "Jiva" (Soul) in practice. The Soul (Jiva) lives, will live, or has lived in the past, due to the four types of life (Prana) that are the result of the arising of karma (Karmodaya) and are in the form of matter (Dravyabhava). The five substances (Panchadravyas) - Matter (Pudgala), etc. - are in the form of the Soul (Jiva). "Mutta" (Form) is the form that is different from the formless pure self (Amurta Shuddhatma) and has the qualities of touch, taste, smell, and color. Matter (Pudgala) is called "Murta" (Form) due to the presence of this form. The Soul (Jiva) substance, although it is manifest in practice due to the presence of the form, is formless (Amurta) in pure certainty (Shuddhanishchayanaya). Dharma, Adharma, Akasha, and Kala substances are also formless (Amurta). "Sapadeśa" (With Region) - The Soul (Jiva) substance, which is characterized by an immeasurable number of regions (Pradesha) as large as the world (Loka), is the first of the five substances (Panchadravyas) and is called "Panchaastikaya" (Five Astikayas) with regions (Sapradesha). The Kala (Time) substance, however, is without regions (Apradesha) due to not being characterized by multiple regions (Bahupradesha). "Eya" (One) - Dharma, Adharma, and Akasha substances are one in the sense of substance (Dravyarthikanaya). The Soul (Jiva), Matter (Pudgala), and Kala (Time) substances, however, are many. "Kheta" (Field) - Akasha (Space) is one field (Kshetra) due to its ability to provide space (Avashadandanasamarthya) for all substances. The remaining five substances are fields (Kshetra). "Kiriya" (Action) - Action (Kriya) is the movement (Chalanavati) and vibration (Parispandavati) in the form of movement from one field (Kshetra) to another. The Soul (Jiva) and Matter (Pudgala) are active (Kriyavanti), while Dharma, Adharma, Akasha, and Kala substances are inactive (Nishkriyani). "Niccha" (Certain) - Dharma, Adharma, Akasha, and Kala substances, although they are impermanent (Anitya) in the sense of their meaning (Arthaparyaya), are permanent (Nitya) in the main sense (Mukhyavrittya) due to not being the means of manifestation (Vibhava) and indication (Vyachana). The Soul (Jiva) and Matter (Pudgala) substances, however, are impermanent (Anitya) in the sense of substance (Dravyarthikanaya) in comparison to the main sense (Mukhyavrittya).

Page #99:
---------------------------
## 95

**Five Astikayas** are eternal, but in relation to the nature of their transformation, which is characterized by heaviness and lightness, they are impermanent. They are also impermanent in relation to the transformation of their manifestation and expression. The five substances, namely, **pudgala**, **dharma**, **adharma**, **akasha**, and **kala**, are the causes because they perform actions such as the body, speech, mind, breath, and the activities of going, staying, understanding, and revolving of the living being. The living being substance, however, does not perform any action on the five substances, **pudgala** etc., even though it interacts with them in the form of teacher and student, etc. It is not a cause.

The living being is not the doer of **karma** and its effects, such as **punya** and **papa**, which are the absence of the substances of **bandha** and **moksha**, according to the pure substance-based view, which is the view of the **katta** (doer) and the pure **parinaama** (result) and the **param** (supreme) state. However, according to the impure view, the living being, being transformed by the use of good and bad, becomes the doer of **punya** and **papa** and the enjoyer of their fruits. When transformed by the pure use, which is in the form of pure knowledge, pure vision, pure nature, pure self-substance, right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, it becomes the doer of **moksha** and the enjoyer of its fruits. It should be understood that the act of doing is the transformation of good, bad, and pure results. The act of doing of the five substances, **pudgala** etc., is their own transformation by their own nature. The act of not doing is in the form of **punya** and **papa** etc., due to the activity of the substance.

**Akasha** is said to be all-pervasive in relation to its pervasiveness in the world and beyond the world. The living being substance is all-pervasive in relation to its pervasiveness in the world, but it is not all-pervasive in relation to each individual living being. It becomes all-pervasive in relation to all living beings after abandoning the state of filling the world. The **pudgala** substance is all-pervasive in relation to the great **skandha** in the form of the world, but it is not all-pervasive in relation to the rest of the **pudgala**. The **kala** substance is not all-pervasive in relation to each **kalaanu** substance. It is all-pervasive in the world in relation to the different **kalaanu** substances, which are the measure of the region of the world.

It is also said that although all substances exist in relation to each other through their mutual entry into each other's sphere of activity, they do not abandon their own nature, which is conscious, unconscious, etc., in reality. Among the six substances, the pure self-substance, which is characterized by the qualities of freedom from attachment, pure consciousness, and pure bliss, and is devoid of good and bad mental, verbal, and bodily activities, is the only one that is worthy of being attained.

## 1

From here onwards, the special explanation of the five **astikayas** mentioned in the **"Jiva Poggalakaya"** etc. **gatha** is given. There, the explanation of the **Jiva Vastikaya** is begun with three **panchaash** **gatha** and nine **antar** chapters in the order of the text. Among those three **panchaash** **gatha**, the first one is the **"Jivothi Havdi Cheda"** etc. **gatha**, which is the **sutr** **gatha** of one chapter, for the purpose of indicating the order of the nine chapters, with the establishment of the living being first, for the sake of the disciple who follows the **Charvaka** view.

The three **shloka** **"Tatraadou Prabhuta Taavaj Jeevatvam Deha Maanata. Amoortatvam Cha Chaitanyam Upayogaat Tatha Kramaat. 1. Kartritaa Bhoktrita Karmayuktatvam Cha Trayam Tathaa. Khyate Yogapadhyena Yatra Tatra Anupoorvatha. 2."** indicate the explanation of the chapters in order, with the establishment of the **sarvagna** first, for the sake of the disciple who follows the **Bhatta** view.

First, the explanation of **prabhutva** is the main one, and the two **gatha** **"Karam Amal"** etc. are for the sake of the establishment of **sarvagna** for the disciple who follows the **Bhatta Charvaka** view. After that, the three **gatha** **"Paanehi Chaduhi"** etc. are for the sake of the establishment of the living being for the disciple who follows the **Charvaka** view, in the form of the explanation of **jeevatva**. Then, the two **sutr** **"Jah Paum"** etc. are for the sake of establishing the living being as only its own body, for the disciple who follows the **Nyaya**, **Mimamsa**, and **Samkhya** views. After that, the three **sutr** **"Jesim Jiva Sahaavo"** etc. are for the sake of explaining the formlessness of the living being, for the disciple who follows the **Bhatta Charvaka** view. Then, the two **sutr** **"Kammaan Fal"** etc. are for the sake of refuting the **Charvaka** view again, with the explanation of the establishment of eternal consciousness. Thus, thirteen **gatha** are passed with the **gatha** of the chapter at the beginning and the five chapters after that. Then, for the sake of addressing the disciple who follows the **Nyaya** view...

## Chapter 96: Description of the Sixfold Substance and the Fivefold Astika

**The use of the term "Uvaogo" is explained in the first nineteen verses.**

**In these nineteen verses, the first verse, "Uvaogo Khulu," indicates the two uses of knowledge and perception.**

**The second verse, "Abhiṇi," explains the eight types of knowledge.**

**The next five verses, starting with "Madinaṇ," describe the five types of perception.**

**The sixth verse, "Micchattā Aṇṇāṇam," explains the three types of ignorance.**

**These eight verses together constitute the verses on the use of knowledge.**

**The next verse, "Dansaṇam Avi," primarily explains the four types of perception, including sight.**

**Thus, the verses on the use of knowledge and perception are completed with the first nine verses, which include five sections.**

**The next ten verses establish the non-difference between the soul and knowledge, based on their shared characteristics, purpose, and other distinctions, using the example of fire and heat.**

**The nature of the soul and knowledge is explained.**

**The soul is defined as the substance that lives, will live, or has lived, characterized by four breaths.**

**Knowledge is defined as the quality that knows objects.**

**The purpose of the soul is to evolve through various stages, including bondage and liberation, without being destroyed.**

**The purpose of knowledge is to simply perceive objects.**

**These are the definitions and purposes of the soul and knowledge in brief.**

**In these ten verses, the first three verses, "Na Vi'appdi," briefly establish the non-difference between the soul and knowledge.**

**The next three verses, "Vavadesa," argue that the difference between substance and qualities is not a contradiction, even though they are distinct.**

**The next two verses, "Na Hi So Samavāyāhim," refute the concept of "Samavāya" (inherence), which is based on the idea that things are present in the same place, like knowledge being present in the soul or cloth being present in the threads.**

**The next two verses, "Vaṇṇarasa," provide an example and explanation of the non-difference between a quality and its possessor.**

**The definition of an example is: "An example is a thing that is accepted without dispute by both the proponent and the opponent, like fire and smoke, or the cause and effect, where the thing is present."**

**The definition of a "Dāṭī" (analogy) is: "An analogy is a thing that is similar to the thing being explained."**

**Thus, the first nine verses have five sections, and the next ten verses have four sections, making a total of nine sections and nineteen verses in this chapter.**

**The next eighteen verses explain the nature of pure souls, which are free from attachment, filled with supreme bliss, and characterized by perfect harmony and tranquility.**

**The first three verses, "Jīvā Aṇāiṇihaṇā," explain the nature of pure souls in general.**

**The next verse, "Udayeṇa," explains the five types of existence, including the arising of the soul.**

**The next eight verses, "Kammam Vedayamāṇo," primarily explain the nature of action.**

**The next verse, "Kamma Kamma Kuvvadi," presents an opposing view.**

**The next seven verses refute the opposing view.**

**The first three verses, "Ogāḍhagāḍha," firmly establish that the soul is not the doer of actions.**

**The next verse, "Jīvā Poggalakāyā," firmly establishes that the soul is the experiencer of the fruits of actions.**

**The next verse, "Tamhā Kammam Kattā," summarizes the nature of the doer and the experiencer.**

Page #101:
---------------------------
The seven gāthās, starting with "Pancāstikāya prābhṛta tadanantaraṁ evaṁ kattā" etc., explain karma-samyuktatva (being associated with karma) and karma-rahitatva (being free from karma) in sequence. These gāthās are primarily meant to address the issue of karma. Thus, with eighteen gāthās in five sections, the text refutes the one-sided view and establishes the many-sided view. It also aims to instruct the disciple who follows the Sāṃkhya philosophy regarding the concept of kartṛtva (agency), the disciple who follows the Buddhist philosophy regarding the concept of bhoktṛtva (enjoyment), and the disciple who follows the Sadāśiva philosophy regarding the concept of karma-samyuktatva (being associated with karma). Therefore, one should understand the three rights of agency, enjoyment, and karma.

After explaining the rights related to the jīvā-stikāya (soul-body), the three gāthās starting with "Ekko jem mahappā" etc. discuss the jīvā-stikāya-cūlikā (the subtle body of the soul) and the first mahādhikāra (major authority) related to the six substances of the pancāstikāya. The remaining six antara-adhikāras (minor authorities) within the fourth antara-adhikāra, which comprises 35 gāthās, discuss the destruction of the aggregates.

For example, the text explains the state of the soul in samsāra (cycle of birth and death) in three ways: with pure certainty, with impure certainty, and with the perception of the non-existent. With pure certainty, the soul is pure and possesses the qualities of existence, consciousness, and knowledge. With impure certainty, the soul is impure and possesses the qualities of karma, karma-phala (fruits of karma), and attachment. With the perception of the non-existent, the soul is impure due to the influence of karma and the substances.

The text then explains the soul's existence in three ways: as jīva (living being), as cetanita (conscious being), and as upayoga-viseṣita (being with specific use). The soul is jīva because it possesses the qualities of existence, consciousness, and knowledge with pure certainty, the qualities of karma, karma-phala, and attachment with impure certainty, and the qualities of substances with the perception of the non-existent. The soul is cetanita because it possesses pure consciousness with pure certainty and impure consciousness with impure certainty. The soul is upayoga-viseṣita because it possesses pure use with pure certainty and impure use with impure certainty.

The text further explains the soul's existence in three ways: as prabhu (lord), as kartā (agent), and as bhoktā (enjoyer). The soul is prabhu because it possesses the power to transform into pure states with pure certainty and impure states with impure certainty. The soul is kartā because it is the agent of pure states with pure certainty, impure states with impure certainty, and the perception of the non-existent. The soul is bhoktā because it enjoys pure happiness with pure certainty, impure happiness and suffering with impure certainty, and external objects with the perception of the non-existent.

The text also explains the soul's existence in three ways: as sadeha-metta (having a body), as amūrta (formless), and as karma-samyukta (associated with karma). The soul is sadeha-metta because it possesses a body due to the influence of karma. The soul is amūrta because it is formless with pure certainty and possesses a body due to the influence of karma with the perception of the non-existent. The soul is karma-samyukta because it is free from karma with pure certainty, associated with karma with the perception of the non-existent, and associated with karma with impure certainty.

The text then explains the meaning of the words and the meaning of the doctrine. The explanation of jīvatva (being a living being) is based on the nine examples mentioned in the Dohaka Sūtra, which states: "Vachchakkharaṁ bhava-sārittya-samga-niraya-piyarāya. Cullīya-haṇḍayi-puṇa-mavaū ṇa ḍiṭuṁtā jāya." This explanation aims to prove the existence of all living beings and to explain the quality of anadi-cetanā (eternal consciousness) from the perspective of the disciple who follows the Cārvāka philosophy. Alternatively, the explanation of asāmanya-cetanā (non-ordinary consciousness) should be understood as common to all philosophies. The explanation of abhinna-jñāna-darśana-upayoga (undivided knowledge, vision, and use) is meant to instruct the disciple who follows the Naiyāyika philosophy. The explanation of prabhu-tva (lordship) is meant to teach about mokṣa (liberation) and the means to achieve it. The statement of the liberated and omniscient being is the proof.

**Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**

"The six substances are: **rayan**, **divdi**, **nayaru**, **unduda**, **upasanu**, **sun**, **rupp**, **phalhiu**, **agani**, **nav**, **ditu**, **janu**."

This is the explanation of the nine examples mentioned in the **Dohaka Sutra**. It is meant to establish the omniscience of the **Jina** in comparison to the disciples who follow the **Bhatta Charvaka** philosophy. The explanation of the **karma** and its effects, both pure and impure, is meant for the disciples who follow the **Nitya-Kartṛtva-Ekanta-Sankhya** philosophy. The explanation of **bhoktṛtva** (enjoyment) is meant for the disciples who follow the **Buddhist** philosophy, as it clarifies that the doer does not enjoy the fruits of his actions. The explanation of **svadēha-pramāṇa** (self-evidence) is meant to dispel the doubts of the disciples who follow the **Nyaya**, **Mimamsa**, and **Kapila** philosophies. The explanation of **amūrtatva** (immateriality) is meant for the disciples who follow the **Bhatta Charvaka** philosophy. The explanation of the **karma** being combined with the **dravya** (substance) and **bhāva** (state) is meant to refute the **Sadā-Mukta** (ever-liberated) philosophy.

The meaning of the **āgama** (scripture) is well-known in the **paramāgama** (supreme scripture) due to its connection with **jīrva**, **tva**, **cetana**, and other **dharma** (qualities). One should contemplate the **śuddha-jīva-astikāya** (pure soul body) with the qualities of **nirūpādhika-kevala-jñāna** (unconditioned omniscience) etc., by abandoning all **vibhāva** (modifications) like **kopa** (anger), **āśvi** (jealousy), **mithyā** (false), **rāga** (attachment), etc.

This is the meaning of the **śabda-naya** (verbal interpretation) and **āgama-bhāva** (scriptural meaning). These should be understood wherever possible during the explanation.

**Why the explanation of the Jīva-astikāya-samudāya (community of soul bodies) is repeated after the previous explanation of the Charvaka and others?**

The disciple raises this objection in the **pūrvapksha** (previous argument). The **parihar** (refutation) is as follows:

When the **vītarāga** (free from attachment) and **sarvajña** (omniscient) are established, the explanation becomes a **pramāṇa** (proof). Therefore, the **adhikāra-navaka** (nine authorities) is mentioned to indicate the order of the explanation and the **prabhuta** (authority) and **adhikāra** (right).

It is said: "The authority of the word comes from the authority of the speaker."

Here, since the **dharma** (qualities) are established in the **dharmi** (possessor of qualities), the explanation of the **dharma** like **cetana-guṇa** (consciousness) etc., which are the **viśēṣaṇa** (qualifiers) of the **viśēṣya** (qualified) and the **lakṣya** (object) **jīva** (soul) as the **dharmi** (possessor of qualities), is established. Therefore, the **adhikāra-navaka** (nine authorities) is mentioned along with the refutation of other philosophies, after establishing the **jīva** (soul), to indicate that the explanation of the **dharma** (qualities) is possible. There is no fault in this.

**End of the Adhikāra Gāthā**

**Hindi Summary of Gāthā 27**

This **gāthā** (verse) explains the six substances in detail, as mentioned earlier.

**Verse 1**

* **Parināma jīva muttam sapadesam eva khetta kiriyā ya.**
* **Niṭṭam kāraṇa kattā savva-gadi-daram hi yapadeso.**

**Meaning:**

The **jīva** (soul) and **pudgala** (matter) are the two substances that possess both **svabhāva** (inherent nature) and **vibhāva** (modifications). The remaining four substances do not possess **vibhāva** (modifications) and are therefore primarily **aparināmi** (unchanging). This means that the four substances do not change their form and remain stable in their form. This is the first **parināma** (change) authority regarding the six substances. Among the six substances, the **jīva** (soul) is conscious.

**Note:** This **gāthā** (verse) is also found in the **Mūlāchāra** chapter 7, **gāthā** 44, and the **Vasunandi Śrāvakāchāra** **gāthā** 23. **Śrī Jayasen Ācharya** has quoted this **gāthā** in his commentary to explain the six substances in detail.

Page #103:
---------------------------
The **Panchaastikaya** (five categories) are:

**1.  Jiva (Soul):**  
*   **Shuddha Nischhaya Naya** (Pure Deterministic View):  Jiva is pure consciousness, living through **Shuddha Chaitanya Pranas** (pure conscious life force).
*   **Vyavahar Naya** (Practical View): Jiva lives through the four **Pranas** (life forces) arising from the **Karma** (actions) - **Indriyadi** (sense organs and their objects), **Dravya** (substance), and **Bhavarupa** (mental states).
*   Jiva is conscious, while the other five **Dravyas** (substances) - **Pudgala** (matter), **Dharma** (merit), **Adharma** (demerit), **Aakash** (space), and **Kaal** (time) - are unconscious and non-living.
*   Jiva is the second **Adhikar** (right) among the six **Dravyas**.

**2.  Mooर्ति (Form):**
*   **Mooर्ति** is the form, distinct from the **Amooर्tik** (formless) pure soul, possessing **Sparsha** (touch), **Rasa** (taste), **Gandha** (smell), and **Varna** (color).
*   **Mooर्ति** is called **Mooर्ति** or **Puhal** (matter).
*   **Jiva Dravya** (soul substance) is **Mooर्tik** (formful) in **Vyavahar Naya** (practical view) but **Amooर्tik** (formless) in **Shuddha Nischhaya Naya** (pure deterministic view).
*   **Dharma**, **Adharma**, **Aakash**, and **Kaal** are all **Amooर्tik**.
*   **Puhal** is **Mooर्tik** in **Nischhaya** (deterministic view).
*   The other five are **Amooर्tik**.
*   **Mooर्ति** is the third **Adhikar** among the six **Dravyas**.

**3.  Pradesh (Region):**
*   **Jiva Dravya** has countless regions, as does **Dharma** and **Adharma**.
*   **Aakash** has infinite regions, while **Puhal** has a countable, countless, and infinite number of regions.
*   These five **Dravyas** are **Sapradeshi** (having regions) or **Bahupradeshi** (having many regions).
*   **Kaal** is **Aapradeshi** (regionless) because it does not have the power to be **Bahupradeshi** and has only one region.
*   **Pradesh** is the fourth **Adhikar** among the six **Dravyas**.

**4.  Ekaneka (One and Many):**
*   **Dharma**, **Adharma**, and **Aakash** are one **Dravya** each, while **Jiva**, **Puhal**, and **Kaal** are many **Dravyas**.
*   **Ekaneka** is the fifth **Adhikar** among the six **Dravyas**.

**5.  Kshetra (Space):**
*   **Aakash** is the only **Kshetramay** (spatial) **Dravya**, capable of accommodating all other **Dravyas**.
*   The other five **Dravyas** are **Akshetri** (non-spatial).
*   **Kshetra** is the sixth **Adhikar** among the six **Dravyas**.

**6.  Kriya (Action):**
*   **Kriya** is the action of moving from one **Kshetra** to another.
*   Only **Jiva** and **Puhal** have **Kriya**.
*   **Dharma**, **Adharma**, **Aakash**, and **Kaal** are **Akriya** (inactive) because they are static.
*   **Kriya** is the seventh **Adhikar** among the six **Dravyas**.

**7.  Nitya (Eternal):**
*   **Dharma**, **Adharma**, **Aakash**, and **Kaal** are **Nitya** (eternal) in their primary form, though they are **Anitya** (impermanent) in terms of **Arthaparyaya** (meaning change).
*   **Jiva** and **Puhal** are **Nitya** in **Dravyarthik Naya** (substance view) but **Anitya** in terms of **Agurulaghu** (heavy-light) **Parinati** (transformation) and **Vibhav Vyajan Paryaya** (change in form).
*   **Nitya** is the eighth **Adhikar** among the six **Dravyas**.

**8.  Sahakarita (Cooperation):**
*   **Puhal**, **Dharma**, **Adharma**, **Aakash**, and **Kaal** cooperate in **Vyavahar Naya** (practical view) to create **Jiva's** body, speech, mind, breath, movement, stillness, immersion, and action.

##  Six Substances - Description of Five Astikayas

Therefore, these are called causes, while the Jiva substance, although it works together like a teacher and student, does not benefit the five substances like Pudgala, etc. in any way. Therefore, they are without cause - this is the ninth cause-related authority in the six substances.

With the pure Dravyarthic Nay, which perceives the pure parinaamic param bhaav, although the Jiva is not the doer of bondage, liberation, substance or bhaav, punya, paap, or the creation of ghat-ghat, etc., yet with the impure Nishchay Nay, it is the doer of the bondage of punya and paap, and the enjoyer of their fruits, as it undergoes parinaaman from the auspicious and inauspicious uses. When this Jiva undergoes parinaaman from the pure use of Samyak Shraddha, Samyak Gyaan, and Samyak Charitra of the pure Atma Dravya, then it is also the doer of liberation and the enjoyer of its fruits. It is worth knowing that the doership of parinaaman in auspicious, inauspicious, and pure bhaavs is everywhere. The five substances like Pudgala undergo parinaaman in their own nature, this is the doership in them. In reality, they are not the doers of punya, paap, etc., but are non-doers. This is the tenth doership authority in the six substances.

There is one Akash substance spread throughout the Lok and Alok, therefore it is called Sarvagat. Dharma and Adharma are Sarvagat in comparison to their pervasiveness in the Lokakash. The Jiva substance is not Sarvagat except for the state of Lok-purn, in comparison to one Jiva, i.e., it has a body, size, and shape except for the Samudghat. In comparison to many Jivas, the entire Lokakash is full of Jivas. The Pudgala substance is Sarvagat in comparison to the Maha-skandha of Lok-pramaan. The rest of the Pudgalas are not Sarvagat. Pudgala is also Sarvagat because the entire Lok is filled with Pudgala. The Kaal substance is not Sarvagat in comparison to each Kaalanu substance, but it is Sarvagat in the Lok in comparison to countless Kaanus of the size of the regions of the Lok. This is the eleventh Sarvagat authority in the six substances.

Although all substances are pervading in one area with the Vyavhaar Nay, and are entering into each other, yet they do not leave their own conscious or unconscious nature with the Nishchay Nay. This is the twelfth authority called Anyony Pravesh in the six substances.

Here, among the six substances, the one who is the bearer of the qualities of Vitarag, Chidanandamay, etc., who is the pure Atma Dravya itself, in which there is no activity of mind, speech, and body, is the one who is worthy of being perceived. This is the meaning.

Page #105:
---------------------------
The text discusses the nine characteristics of a soul (jiva) as described in the five astikayas (bodies) mentioned in the previous verses. It explains these characteristics in detail through 33 verses, each verse representing a specific aspect of the soul.

The text begins by outlining the nine characteristics of a soul:

1. **Prabhuta** (Sovereignty): The soul is sovereign and independent.
2. **Jivatva** (Soul-ness): The soul is the essence of being.
3. **Dehamatrata** (Body-limited): The soul is limited by the body.
4. **Amurta** (Formless): The soul is formless.
5. **Chaitanya** (Consciousness): The soul is conscious.
6. **Upayogi** (Utilitarian): The soul is capable of using its faculties.
7. **Kartṛta** (Doer): The soul is the doer of actions.
8. **Bhoktṛta** (Experiencer): The soul experiences the consequences of its actions.
9. **Karmayuktatva** (Bound by Karma): The soul is bound by karma.

The text then explains how these characteristics are explained in the 33 verses, highlighting the different perspectives of various schools of thought:

* **Bhatta** (Jain) perspective: The first two verses focus on the sovereignty of the soul, leading to the ultimate goal of omniscience.
* **Charvaka** (Materialist) perspective: The next three verses discuss the soul's existence and its connection to the body.
* **Nyaya** (Logic) and **Mimamsa** (Ritualistic) perspectives: The following two verses explain the soul's connection to its physical body.
* **Sankhya** (Dualistic) perspective: The next three verses discuss the soul's formless nature.
* **Charvaka** (Materialist) perspective: The next two verses refute the materialist view and emphasize the soul's consciousness.
* **Nyaya** (Logic) perspective: The next 19 verses discuss the soul's utilitarian nature, focusing on the two types of utilization: knowledge and perception.

The text concludes by mentioning the eight types of knowledge, starting with the verse "Aabhinī..."

**Six Substances - Description of Five Astikayas**

The sutra "**Ityadi**" is one. Then, for the explanation of the five types of knowledge, beginning with "**Matinaan**", there are five sutras. Then, for the sequence of three types of ignorance, there is one sutra, "**Micchatta Annaan**". In this way, there are seven sutras for the use of knowledge.

Further, for the four types of perception, beginning with "**Darshanam Avi**", there is one sutra. In this way, there are nine verses in five different locations, taking into account the authority of the knowledge and perception. Further, up to ten verses, even though there is a difference in the designation, characteristics, purpose, etc., of the living being and knowledge in terms of practice, the non-dualistic nature of knowledge and the living being is established for the Naiyayikas from the perspective of the regions and existence, just like fire and heat. Here, the difference between "**Ji**" and "**Ka**" is mentioned from the perspective of designation and purpose. "**Jiva**" is the designation for the living being, which is a substance, and "**Gyan**" is the designation for the knowledge, which is a quality. The living being is alive through the four breaths, and the one who lives, will live, or has lived is a living being. This is the characteristic of the living being substance. The characteristic of the knowledge quality is that it is the means by which objects are known. The purpose of the living being substance is to not be destroyed while undergoing transformations in the cycles of bondage and liberation. The purpose of the knowledge quality is only to know objects. In this way, it is important to know the different designations, characteristics, and purposes of the living being and knowledge in brief.

**i**

In the middle of these ten verses, there are three sutras, "**Na Viapyad**", etc., to establish the non-dualistic nature of the living being and knowledge in brief. Then, there are three verses, "**Vavadesa**", etc., supporting the idea that even though there is non-duality between substance and qualities, there is a difference in terms of name, etc. Then, the qualities and substances residing in one region, which are mutually inseparable, i.e., never separated, i.e., whose non-duality is established, and which are mutually inseparable, non-eradicable, and supporting each other, have a difference in regions in the different living beings, etc., which are in the form of qualities and substances, but there is no difference in regions between the soul and knowledge. The soul is knowledge, just like the fiber is the plant. This relationship, that this is in that, is called the **Samavaya** relationship. In the Naiyayika view, this **Samavaya** is denied. To explain this, there are two sutras, "**Na Hi So Samavayahin**", etc. Then, there are two sutras, "**Vannaras**", etc., to explain the example and counter-example in relation to the non-duality between the quality and the qualified in some respect. The characteristic of the example is stated: "**Dristau Antau Dharmon Swabhaav Agni Dhumyo: Iva Sadhya Sadhakayo: Vadi Prativadibyam Kartribhutabhyam Avivaadein Yatra Vastuni Sa Dristanta:**" i.e., the example is that object in which the nature of the object and the proof is seen without any contradiction or dispute by the proponent and opponent, just like smoke in fire. Briefly, just as there is a characteristic of the example, there is also a characteristic of the counter-example. In this way, there are five locations in the previous nine verses and ten locations here in these ten verses.

Page #107:
---------------------------
The five-fold body (Panchaastikaya) has been established through four such communities, by means of nineteen sutras, through nine different locations, resulting in the fall of the community (Samudaya Patanika).

Thereafter, the pure soul body (Jeevaastikaya) undergoes a transformation into the state of eternal bliss (Param Anandamaya) and the form of nectar (Amritaroop), characterized by perfect harmony (Param Samarsi Bhaav).  The soul (Jeeva) that is distinct from the pure soul body (Jeevaastikaya) and possesses the nature of being the doer of actions (Kartapana), the experiencer of actions (Bhoktapana), and the one connected to actions (Sanyogapana), is explained as being either real (Sat) or unreal (Asat) through eighteen verses, in a sequential manner (Anupoorvi).

Within these eighteen verses, the first location (Sthal) comprises three verses, starting with "Jeeva Anaiinihana," which explain the community (Samudaya) statement.  The second location (Sthal) consists of one verse, starting with "Udayen," which explains the five states (Bhaav) of arising (Audayik) and so on.  The third location (Sthal) comprises six verses, starting with "Kamman Vedaymano," which primarily explain the nature of being the doer (Kartapana).  The fourth location (Sthal) contains one verse, starting with "Kamman Kamman Kuchdi," which presents the opposing viewpoint (Poorvapksha).  The fifth location (Sthal) comprises seven verses that address the opposing viewpoint (Poorvapksha).  Within these seven verses, the first three verses, starting with "Ogad Gadh," definitively state that the soul (Jeeva) is not the doer of karmic actions (Dravyakarma).  Then, despite the soul (Jeeva) not being the doer of karmic actions (Dravyakarma), one verse, starting with "Jeeva Poggalakaya," states that the soul (Jeeva) is the experiencer of the fruits of karma (Bhoktapana).  Another verse, starting with "Tamha Kamman Kattha," states the restriction of the doer-experiencer (Kartapana-Bhoktapana).  The next two verses, starting with "Evam Kattha," sequentially explain the soul's (Jeeva) connection to karma (Karma Sanyuktapana) and liberation from karma (Karma Muktapana).  Thus, there are seven verses in response to the opposing viewpoint (Poorvapksha).

In this way, through eighteen verses, five locations, and a sequential approach, the opposing viewpoint (Ekantammat) is refuted, the principle of non-absolutism (Anekantamat) is established, the disciple is addressed in accordance with the Samkhya philosophy, the disciple who follows the Buddhist philosophy is explained, the doubt of the disciple who believes in the dependence on Sadashiva (Sadashiva Ashrit Matidhari Shishya) is dispelled, and the connection to karma (Karma Sanyuktapana) is explained.  Thus, the three rights (Adhikar) of being the doer (Kartapana), the experiencer (Bhoktapana), and the one connected to karma (Karma Sanyuktapana) should be understood.

Following the explanation of the nine rights (Adhikar) related to the soul body (Jeevaastikaya), three verses, starting with "Ekko Jem Mahappa," constitute the soul body (Jeevaastikaya) chapter (Chulika).  In this way, the first great right (Maha Adhikar), which establishes the five-fold body (Panchaastikaya) and the six substances (Dravy), has resulted in the fall of the community (Samudaya Patanika) through three verses, nineteen verses, and six internal rights (Antar Adhikar) in the fourth internal right (Antar Adhikar).

**Uttanika:**  Further, the pure soul (Atma) that remains in the state of the world (Sansar Avस्था) is explained as being pure and without any limiting conditions (Upaadhirahita Shuddhabhav), while the impure soul (Atma) is explained as being impure and having limiting conditions (Upaadhi Sahit Bhaavkarma Ragadi Bhaav), and the unreal (Asadbhoot) conventional reality (Vyavharnay) is explained as being the karmic action (Dravyakarma) that arises from the limiting condition (Upaadhi) of karmic action (Bhaavkarma), as far as possible.

**Description of the Five Astikayas of the Soul**

**General Meaning with Anvaya (Logical Order):**

(Jivo) This soul is a living being, (Cheda) conscious, (Uvogavisesido) possessing use, (Pahu) a master, (Karta) a doer, (Ya Bhota) and an enjoyer. (Dehamatto) It has a body of a certain size, (Nahimutto) it is not material in essence, and (Kammasamjutto) it is associated with karma. It possesses these nine qualities.

**Specific Meaning:**

This soul lives through pure consciousness, knowledge, and other pure life-forces, according to pure perception. It also lives through impure consciousness, such as the life-forces of karma and its fruits, according to impure perception. Similarly, it lives through the life-forces of matter, according to the non-conventional, non-real, and practical perception. It has lived, is living, and will live, therefore it is a living being.

This soul is conscious due to pure knowledge and consciousness according to pure perception, and due to karma and its fruits, according to impure perception. It possesses use due to pure use, such as perfect vision and perfect knowledge, according to pure perception, and due to impure use, such as perception, knowledge, and other life-forces of karma, according to impure perception. It is a master due to the ability to transform into pure results, such as liberation and its causes, according to pure perception, and due to the ability to transform into impure results, such as the causes of the cycle of birth and death, according to impure perception. It is a doer due to pure emotions, according to pure perception, due to emotions and karma, such as attachment, aversion, etc., according to impure perception, and due to actions of matter, such as knowledge-obscuring karma, etc., and external actions, such as the body, according to non-conventional, non-real, and practical perception. It is an enjoyer due to pure happiness, born from the pure soul, free from attachment, according to pure perception, due to happiness and sorrow, born from the senses, according to impure perception, and due to the enjoyment of external objects, such as food and drink, which are the causes of happiness and sorrow, according to non-conventional, non-real, and practical perception.

It is the size of the universe, according to pure perception, and countless times the size of the universe, according to practical perception. However, it is the size of the body, according to practical perception, due to the arising of the name-karma called "body." It is not material in essence, according to pure perception, and it is free from karma. However, it is material and associated with karma, according to non-conventional, non-real, and practical perception, due to the association with karma from the beginning of time.

This is the explanation of the words and their meanings according to different perceptions. Now, we will explain the meaning according to different viewpoints. Here, the explanation of the soul is given from the perspective of a student of the Charvaka philosophy.

**Meaning of the Quoted Verse:**

These nine examples are for those who do not believe in the soul and rebirth.

(1) **Vatsa (Child):** A child starts sucking its mother's breast immediately after birth. This is impossible without past impressions. Therefore, the soul and its past birth are proven.

...

...

Page #109:
---------------------------
(2) The being with the letters, starting from the five-lettered being, pronounces the letters knowingly for its own purpose. If the being is considered to be made of the five elements, then it cannot pronounce the letters knowingly and with knowledge. Just as a machine made of inert matter cannot pronounce words knowingly, so too the soul is different from the elements.
(3) Existence (birth) - the holding of the body - as long as a permanent soul is not considered, the holding of the body - birth will not be possible.
(4) Analogy - what is seen in one living being is also seen in others. All beings have four cognitions within them: food, fear, sex, and attachment. The functioning of the senses is the same. All this cannot happen without a different soul. If only the physical body is considered, then the analogy will be meaningless. Why is this similarity without a specific reason?
(5-6) Heaven and Hell - Heaven and Hell are famous in the world. If the soul is not considered, then who will go to heaven as a result of virtue and who will go to hell as a result of sin?
(7) Ancestors - If the soul is not considered, then the famous saying that ghosts and spirits come and say that they were your father, etc., will be destroyed, or the worship of ancestors, shraddha, etc., in the world will not be possible if the soul is destroyed.
(8) Stove - If the soul is made of the five elements, then the pot placed on the stove is made of the five elements: earth, water, fire, air, and space. Why is there no knowledge or desire in it?
(1) Dead - The dead body is also made of earth, water, fire, air, and space. Why is there no desire or knowledge in it?
In this way, it is proved by nine examples that the soul is eternal and different from inert matter.
Or, the explanation of the common quality of consciousness should be known in a general way for all opinions. This being is not different from the use of knowledge and the use of vision. This explanation has been given to explain to the disciple following the Nyaya school of thought, because the Nyaya school of thought sometimes accepts the quality and the difference of the quality. This soul is the Lord because it is the preacher of liberation and the means of liberation. This explanation has been given because the words of the liberated omniscient are authoritative.

**Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**

This explanation, relying on the Bhatta Cakramataka, is intended to help disciples understand the concept of omniscience. It uses nine examples, as stated in the following couplet, because the Bhatta-Carvaka philosophy does not accept the existence of an omniscient being.

The meaning of the quoted verse is explained here to establish the truth. Just as the brightness of a gem-lamp appears to increase and decrease, we can infer that there must be something with greater brilliance. Similarly, since we see knowledge increasing and decreasing in the beings of the world, it is possible for a being to possess complete knowledge. The one who possesses complete knowledge is the omniscient. This is the meaning of the other examples as well: (2) the increasing and decreasing brightness of the sun's rays, (3) the moonlight, (4) the light of the stars, (5) the light of metals and stones, (6) the shine of gold, (7) the shine of silver, (8) the brilliance of crystal, (9) the intensity of fire. The example of gold and silver is relevant because they are found to be pure even when they are impure. Similarly, an impure soul, while becoming pure, should also be found to be completely pure. That is the omniscient.

This being is the doer of both pure and impure actions. This explanation is given to help disciples who follow the Sankhya philosophy, which holds the view that the being is not the doer. And this being is the enjoyer. This explanation is given to address disciples who follow the Buddhist philosophy, which believes that the doer does not experience the fruits of his actions because they are transient. This being remains as the witness of its own body. This statement is made to dispel the doubts of disciples who follow the Nyaya, Mimamsa, and Kapila philosophies, because they believe that the soul is omnipresent or atomic. This being is formless. This explanation is given to address disciples who follow the Bhatta-Carvaka philosophy, because they do not consider the being to be different from pure, inert matter, which is beyond the senses. This being is combined with material karma and mental karma. This explanation is given to refute the Sadashiva philosophy, because they believe that the soul is always liberated and pure. In this way, it is important to understand the meaning through different philosophies.

The explanation of the meaning through the Agamas is that this being is the possessor of the nature of being, consciousness, etc. This is well-known in the Param-Agama. The meaning here is that one should strive to contemplate the pure being-astikaya, which is free from all limitations and possesses only the qualities of omniscience, etc., by abandoning all the false perceptions and the results of the limitations like attachment, etc., which are born from karma.

In this way, it is important to understand the meaning of words, the meaning of the Nayas, the meaning of philosophies, the meaning of the Agamas, and the meaning of the essence, as much as possible, at all times.

##  The Five Astikayas and the Liberation of the Soul

**107**

Here, the disciple asks why, after explaining the community of the five Astikayas in the context of the views of Charvaka and others, the text now states that the liberation of the soul is the foundation for understanding the nature of the soul. The Acharya responds by explaining that the previous discussion was meant to establish the authority of the teachings, emphasizing the importance of the nine authorities, such as the authority of the liberated soul. This is because the teachings are only valid if they come from a source that is truly liberated and omniscient. As the saying goes, "The authority of the speaker determines the authority of the words."

Here, the text emphasizes that the nature of the soul can only be understood if the soul itself exists. This is a fundamental principle of the scriptures. Therefore, before discussing the specific qualities of the soul, such as consciousness, it is necessary to establish the existence of the soul itself. This is why the text first refutes other viewpoints and then presents the nine authorities as a foundation for understanding the soul. There is no contradiction in this approach.

Thus, the discussion of the authorities is complete.

**Time for Explanation - Verse 28**

Here, the text describes the liberated soul's true nature, free from all limitations. The soul, freed from the shackles of karma and defilement, transcends the cycle of rebirth and attains the end of the world. It then becomes all-knowing and experiences infinite bliss, free from the limitations of the senses.

**Verse 28**

The soul, freed from karma and defilement, transcends the cycle of rebirth and attains the end of the world. It then becomes all-knowing and experiences infinite bliss, free from the limitations of the senses.

The soul, being inherently pure, is liberated from the influence of karma at a specific moment. This liberation leads to the soul's natural tendency to ascend beyond the cycle of rebirth. Having reached the end of the world, the soul remains in a state of eternal bliss, free from the need for further movement. This is because the soul, in its true nature, is pure consciousness and omniscience. It experiences infinite bliss, transcending the limitations of the senses.

The liberated soul continues to exist as a living being, characterized by the principles of life force and sustenance. It possesses the quality of consciousness, the ability to perceive, and the capacity to utilize its consciousness. It also possesses the power of authority, the ability to act, the experience of bliss, the awareness of its past and future bodies, and the ultimate state of formlessness, free from all limitations.

The liberated soul is no longer bound by karma, as it has been freed from both material and mental karma. Material karma is associated with the physical body, while mental karma is associated with the fluctuations of consciousness. The fluctuations of consciousness are caused by the interaction of the soul with the karmic veil, which obscures its true nature. When the karmic veil is removed, the soul's true nature, pure consciousness, shines forth.

The description of the six substances and the five astikayas, which pervades the entire universe in all its regions simultaneously, attains a certain state of stability and does not undergo transformation. This is indeed the definite attainment of omniscience and omnipresence, which is the cessation of the agency of the karmas that are bound to the substances and the karmas. This is also the cessation of the experience of the fruits of happiness and sorrow, which are conditional due to the absence of experience prior to transformation. This is also the experience of the self, which is infinite consciousness, free from the pain of endless transformation, and established in its own nature, as the experience of its own independent nature. || 28 ||

Hindi Time Explanation Verse-28 Anvayaarth - (Karmamalvipra Mukta:) The soul freed from the karma-mal (Karma-dust) (Urdhva) above (Lokasya Antam) the end of the world (Adhigamy) having attained (Sa: Sarvajnanadarshi) he, the omniscient-omnipresent (Anantam) infinite (Anindriyam) non-sensory (Sukham) happiness (Labhate) experiences.
Commentary - Here the nature of the liberated soul is described without any conditions.
The soul (Karma Rajake) due to the nature of the other substances, when it is completely freed from the karma-dust at that moment (Apne) due to its upward-moving nature, it attains the end of the world and due to the absence of any further movement (Vahan) it becomes stable there, only knowledge and only vision (Nij) being its nature, it does not leave them and experiences infinite, non-sensory happiness. That liberated soul, the essence of which is the characteristic (nature) of the living being, the characteristic of which is the nature of the knower, the characteristic of which is the nature of the 'use' of the transformation of consciousness, the power of all the acquired (spiritual) rights is the form of dominance, the extraordinary nature of all things is the form of the creation of its own nature (Nij Swaroopko Rachaneroop) is the agency, the characteristic of which is the nature of self-independence is the form of the attainment of happiness is the experience, the past, the future (final) body according to the immersion transformation is the form of the body measure, and the conditional relationship is the ultimate (completely) separate from the abstract nature. (The liberated soul) is never associated with karma, because it is completely free from substance-karma and karma-karma. Substance-karma is the nature of the pudgala and karma-karma is the transformation of consciousness. The power of consciousness, due to the contact (relationship) with the karma of ignorance, etc., is limited in its operation, and therefore it operates in each and every region of the knowable universe, one after the other, and undergoes transformation. But when the contact of the karma of ignorance, etc., is destroyed, then it operates simultaneously in all the regions of the knowable universe, and becomes stable in a certain way, and does not attain any other object, and does not undergo transformation. This (the absence of transformation of the power of consciousness), is indeed the definite (fixed, immovable) attainment of omniscience and omnipresence, which is the destruction of the agency of the karmas that are bound to the substances and the karmas. This is also the cessation of the experience of the fruits of happiness and sorrow, which are conditional due to the absence of experience prior to transformation.

##  Verse 28:

**109**
The destruction of the five astikayas, and the enjoyment of the infinite bliss of the soul, which has attained its eternal state of being, free from the sorrow of the endless cycle of birth and death, is the experience of its true nature.

**Commentary:**

This verse, through the qualities of being a means to liberation and being supreme, shows the nature of the liberated soul, which is characterized by perfect knowledge, etc., in order to establish the attainment of omniscience.

**General Meaning:**

The liberated soul, freed from the defilement of karma, becomes omniscient and all-seeing. It ascends and reaches the end of the universe, where it experiences infinite, non-sensory bliss.

**Specific Meaning:**

This soul, completely free from the three types of karma - karma of the substance, karma of the mind, and karma of the body - becomes omniscient and all-seeing through perfect knowledge and perfect vision. Due to its nature of upward movement, it ascends and reaches the end of the universe, where it remains, as there are no further astikayas. What does it do there? It experiences the natural, infinite, non-sensory bliss of the liberated soul.

**Interpretation:**

This verse implies that, out of the nine principles mentioned in the previous verse, the eight principles of pure soul, pure consciousness, pure use, etc., should be understood as applicable to the liberated state as well, as long as they do not contradict the scriptures.

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

**Verse 29 of the Time Commentary**

He is self-aware, omniscient, all-knowing, and sees all beings. He attains infinite, unobstructed, and formless bliss. ||29||

**Commentary:**

This verse supports the idea of the Siddha's (liberated soul) unconditioned knowledge, perception, and bliss. The soul's inherent nature is knowledge, perception, and bliss. In the state of samsara (cycle of birth and death), due to the contraction of the soul's power by the karmic impurities, it experiences limited knowledge, perception, and happiness through the senses. It experiences happiness that is dependent on external objects, bound by form, obstructed, and finite. 

However, when all karmic impurities are destroyed, the soul's power becomes free and uncontracted. It then spontaneously and simultaneously knows and perceives everything (all substances, fields, time, and states). It experiences bliss that is independent, formless, unobstructed, and infinite. Therefore, the Siddha, who knows and perceives everything and experiences his own bliss, has no need for anything external. ||29||

## Pancastikaya Prabhruta Sanskrit Tatparyavritti - 29

**Now, what was said earlier, the meaning of the term "Jada Samiti" from the Nirupaadhi Shaan Darshan, is further supported by the statement: "Jada himself, if he is all-pervading, all-world-seeing, - the soul, by certainty, is of the nature of pure knowledge, pure vision, and pure bliss, - even though he is in the state of Samsara, covered by karma, he knows something or the other, by the knowledge that diminishes the obscurations caused by the interruption of the process of karma, he sees something or the other, by such vision, he experiences something or the other, the worldly bliss, which is dependent on the senses, and is full of obstacles, - the same soul, the knower, by certainty, becomes all-knowing by the power of time and attainment, and becomes all-seeing."**

**How does he, thus become, act? He attains, obtains, the sense-less, obstacle-less, self-contained, supreme bliss. What? Bliss, is the explanation. What kind of bliss? Sense-less. Again, how is it? Obstacle-less. Again, what is special about it? Its own self-nature. Again, what kind? It is formless, due to being independent of the gross senses.**

**Here, by the statement "he himself becomes", the earlier mentioned Nirupaadhitva (non-dependence) is supported. And, by the statement "he himself becomes all-knowing, all-seeing, by certainty", the earlier mentioned Sarvajnatva (all-knowingness) and Sarvadarshitva (all-seeingness) are supported.**

**Now, a follower of the Bhattacharvaka philosophy says: "There is no all-knowing, due to non-perception, like the horn of a hare."**

**To this, the reply is given: "Where is there no all-knowing? In this country, and in this time? Or, in the three worlds, and in the three times? If it is said that there is no all-knowing in this country, and in this time, then it is acceptable. But, if it is said that there is no all-knowing in the three worlds, and in the three times, then how do you know? If you know that the three worlds, and the three times, are devoid of an all-knowing, then you yourself are all-knowing. Why? Because, whoever knows the three worlds, and the three times, is the all-knowing. If, on the other hand, you do not know the three worlds, and the three times, devoid of an all-knowing, then how do you deny that there is no all-knowing in the three worlds, and in the three times?"**

**Now, the opinion is: "What is the example here? Just as someone, seeing a ground devoid of a pot, with his eyes, later says, "There is no pot on this ground", it is right. Another, who is blind, says, "There is no pot on this ground", but it is not so. Similarly, whoever knows the three worlds, and the three times, devoid of an all-knowing, by direct perception, is capable of denying the all-knowing, and not another, like a blind man. But, whoever knows the three worlds, and the three times, does not deny the all-knowing in any way. Why? Because, by having the knowledge of the three worlds, and the three times, he himself is all-knowing. And, the statement "due to non-perception", is not right. Why? Because, is the non-perception yours, or of the people who exist in the three worlds, and the three times? If the non-perception is yours, then there is no absence of the all-knowing. Why? Because, if you do not know the subtle things like atoms, and the thoughts of others, then do they not exist? Or, if the perception of the all-knowing is of the people who exist in the three worlds, and the three times, then how do you know it? This earlier thought remains. This is the refutation of the reason. And, the statement "like the horn of a hare", is also not right. Why? Because, the horn of a hare does not exist everywhere, it is seen directly in a cow, etc. Similarly, the all-knowing does not exist in the desired country, and time, and not everywhere. This is the refutation of the reason, and the refutation of the example, in short.**

**Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**

**Now, the argument:** You have stated that the absence of omniscience is a fault. What is the proof for the existence of omniscience? 

**The proof is stated here:** Omniscience exists, as explained earlier, because there is no proof to contradict it, just like the experience of happiness, sorrow, etc., which are self-evident. 

**Or, a second proof is stated through inference:** The object of inference is that any particular person, whose nature is subtle, distant, in the past, in the future, or different, is perceived. 

**Why?** Because it is the subject of inference. Whatever is the subject of inference is perceived by someone, just like fire, etc. These are the subjects of inference, therefore they are perceived by someone. 

**Whatever is not perceived by someone is not the subject of inference, just like flowers in the sky, etc. These are not the subjects of inference, therefore they are not perceived by someone.**

**Therefore, they are perceived by someone.**

**In short, this is the proof for the existence of omniscience. A detailed explanation of the refutation of the arguments against omniscience, which are not valid, contradictory, and not conclusive, is given elsewhere in the detailed explanation of omniscience. Here, it is not mentioned because this is a spiritual text.**

**The meaning is that this very form of the omniscient, free from attachment, is to be contemplated as constantly attainable by the abandonment of all attachments, etc.**

**Thus, these two verses explain the concept of omnipotence as the main point.**

**Hindi Commentary on Verse 29:**

**The first verse states that the knowledge and vision of the liberated soul is free from all limitations. This verse further supports this by stating "Jado hi sayam" (He is himself).**

**Meaning with Anvaya:** (If that) soul (sayam) itself (savinh) is omniscient (y) and (savvalokadarsi) sees all the worlds (jado) being (anatam) without limitations, (avyabadham) without obstacles, (sagam) arising from its own self, and (amutt) formless (suh) happiness (pappodi) attains or experiences.

**Special Meaning:** This soul, even though it possesses the nature of pure knowledge, pure vision, and supreme happiness, is covered by karma in the state of the world. It gradually knows through the knowledge of the cessation of the senses, which is the knowledge of the senses. It sees through the vision of the eyes and the vision of the mind. It experiences the limited, dependent, and formless happiness that arises from the senses. When the soul, which is conscious, becomes itself omniscient and all-seeing due to the attainment of time, etc., it experiences the formless happiness that is free from the limitations of the senses and is dependent on the self. Here, the statement that this soul becomes itself omniscient and all-seeing supports the fact that it is already free from limitations and is omniscient and all-seeing.

**Here, someone who follows the Charvaka philosophy might say that there is no omniscience because no one is seen. Just like the horns of a donkey are not seen?**

Page #117:
---------------------------
The **Pancastikaya** refutes the doubt that there is no omniscient being, stating that if you say that there is no omniscient being in this time, then there is no omniscient being in the three realms and three times. If you say that there is no omniscient being in this assembly or in this place, then we accept it. But how do you know that there is no omniscient being in the three realms and three times? If you have known the omniscient being without knowing the three realms and three times, then you yourself are omniscient, because the omniscient being is one who knows all three realms. If you are not omniscient and you do not know the three realms and three times, then how can you deny that there is no omniscient being in the three realms and three times?

An analogy is given: Just as someone who has not seen a pot on the earth with their own eyes says that there is no pot on this earth, their statement is correct. But can a blind person say that there is no pot here without seeing it? No, they cannot. Similarly, only someone who has seen the three realms and three times and directly knows that there is no omniscient being can deny the existence of an omniscient being. Another person who does not know everything cannot deny it like a blind person. But someone who knows the three realms and three times cannot deny the omniscient being in any way, because they themselves become omniscient - they have knowledge of the three realms and three times.

You have argued that there is no attainment of omniscience, but that is not correct. The question is whether you have not attained omniscience or whether the people in the three realms and three times have not attained omniscience. If you have not attained omniscience, then it does not mean that there is no omniscience, because you do not even know about subtle substances like atoms, or the thoughts of others. It cannot be assumed that because you do not know, these things do not exist. If you say that the people in the three realms and three times have not attained omniscience, then how did you know this? We have already considered this. This flaw is in your argument. And the analogy you gave, "like the horns of a donkey," is also not correct, because donkeys do not have horns, but it does not mean that there are no horns anywhere. Horns are clearly seen in cows and other animals. Similarly, the omniscient being is not here in this country, but it does not mean that it does not exist anywhere. In this way, it should be understood that there are flaws in your argument and analogy.

Then the doubter says that you have pointed out the flaws in the absence of an omniscient being, but tell us what evidence is there for the existence of an omniscient being? Here is the evidence: There is an omniscient being, because as stated earlier, there is no evidence to contradict it, just as there is no evidence to contradict the existence of pleasure and pain that we experience. Or, another inferential evidence is that subtle substances, objects that are obstructed or covered by others, objects that are far away, and objects that are in the past or future, are all known by the omniscient being.

Page #118:
---------------------------
## 114

The six substances and five astikayas are described as objects, their nature is imperceptible. These objects are directly perceived by any particular person. This is the established doctrine. The supporting reason for it is that this park is inferred, whatever object is the subject of inference, it is certainly perceived by someone, like fire, etc. Because all these objects are the subject of inference, therefore they are certainly perceived by someone. Whatever is not perceived by anyone is also not the subject of inference. Like a flower in the sky, it is not perceived by anyone. In this way, one should know the proof of the existence of omniscience in brief. In detail, the refutation or support of omniscience is explained in other texts with the help of invalid, contradictory, multi-faceted, and insignificant reasons. One should know it from there. This is a spiritual text, nothing special is said in it. The meaning is that this is the nature of the liberated omniscient, who, by abandoning all attachments and other obstacles, is constantly capable of grasping and contemplating. || 29 ||

## Time Explanation Verse 30

With four breaths, he lives, he will live, who indeed lived before. That being is breaths, again strength, senses, lifespan, and breath. || 30 ||

**Explanation of the quality of being alive:**

Breaths are characterized by senses, strength, lifespan, and breath. Among them, those that are connected to the universal consciousness are called "भावप्राण" (bhaava-praana), and those that are connected to the universal matter are called "द्रव्यप्राण" (dravya-praana). Because both of these breaths are sustained without interruption in all three times, the being is a "संसारि" (samsari) or a being in the cycle of birth and death. However, the liberated being only sustains "भावप्राण" (bhaava-praana), which is why it is considered liberated. || 30 ||

## Hindi Time Explanation Verse 30

**Anvayaartha:** (Yah khalu) who (chaturbhih praanaih) with four breaths (jeevatti) lives. (jeevishati) will live and (jeevitah purvam) lived in the past, (sah jeev) that is the being. (punah praanah) and those breaths (indriyam) senses, (balam) strength, (aayuh) lifespan and (umchchvaasah) breath.

**Tika:** This is the explanation of the quality of being alive.

Breaths are in the form of senses, strength, lifespan, and breath. Among them (in breaths), those that are connected to the universal consciousness are called "भावप्राण" (bhaava-praana), and those that are connected to the universal matter are called "द्रव्यप्राण" (dravya-praana). Because both of these breaths are sustained without interruption in all three times (with unwavering flow), the being is a "संसारि" (samsari) or a being in the cycle of birth and death.

The five astikayas are the essence of life. It should be understood that the liberated (the Siddha) only have the essence of life, which is the essence of the four breaths. ||30||

**Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**

Infinite are the *aguru* and *laghu* (qualities, parts) with which all beings are constituted. They are infinite in number and spread throughout countless realms. Some beings are not present in all realms, being bound by false views and passions. Many beings are liberated from these, becoming *siddhas* (liberated souls).

**Explanation**

This passage describes the natural characteristics of beings and their division into liberated and unliberated. Beings are essentially indivisible and constitute a single substance, occupying a single, undivided realm. Their *aguru* and *laghu* qualities are indivisible, characterized by their inherent nature, which is the basis of their existence. These qualities are infinite in number, constantly changing and increasing or decreasing in the six realms of existence. The realms themselves are composed of countless, indivisible atoms, which are extremely subtle.

Some beings, due to their specific state of existence, are present in all realms, while others are not. Those who are bound by false views and passions, which have been present since time immemorial, are *samsarin* (bound to the cycle of rebirth). Those who are liberated from these are *siddhas*, and both types of beings are infinite in number.

##  Translation:

**Verse 31-32**

This section discusses the characteristics of souls, including their lightness and heaviness, their countless locations, their pervasiveness and non-pervasiveness, and their liberation and bondage.

**Explanation:**

* **Agurulaghu** (lightness and heaviness) qualities are infinite, each with countless divisions and subdivisions, arising from the six categories of existence (**shat-sthana**).
* All souls are characterized by these infinite **agurulaghu** qualities.
* Souls are located in countless regions, as vast as the space of the universe.
* Some souls are pervasive, filling the entire universe, either in terms of their physical presence or their subtle influence. This is supported by the saying, "The universe is continuous, both gross and subtle."
* However, some souls are not pervasive, either because they are not physically present in the universe or because their senses are weak or impaired.
* Souls are further distinguished by their **mithyadarshan** (false belief), **kashaya** (passions), and **yoga** (attachment). Those who are free from these are **siddhas** (liberated souls), while those who are bound by them are **samsarin** (bound souls).
* The ultimate goal is to shed all **vikalpa** (false perceptions) and **raga** (attachment), becoming like a **siddha** and experiencing the bliss of one's own pure soul.

**Overall Meaning:**

This section emphasizes the infinite nature of souls, their diverse locations, and their potential for liberation. It also highlights the importance of shedding false beliefs and passions to achieve liberation.

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

The six substances are eternal. Some of these living beings, i.e., some Kevalis, spread throughout the universe at the time of the Kevali's liberation, or, in other words, the subtle, stationary, one-sensed living beings are omnipresent in the universe - they are present everywhere. In this regard, some living beings are omnipresent, while others, who are not in the state of filling the universe, or the one-sensed, the confused, and the five-sensed living beings, are not omnipresent, i.e., they are present in some places and not in others - they are not present in all parts of the universe. Among all these living beings, those who are devoid of attachment, etc., and who are in the state of pure Jiva-astikaya, which is characterized by eternal bliss and one nature, are bound by false perception, passions, and karmas, as much as possible, and are infinite in number. These are the worldly beings. And those who are free from false perception, passions, and karmas are infinite in number. These are the Siddhas.

Here, the meaning is that, with the hope of liberation, abandoning all kinds of attachments, etc., like the Siddhas, this soul of mine, which is adorned with the taste of eternal bliss, is the pure Jiva-astikaya, and is worthy of being spoken about. 131-32.

In this way, the three verses on the main point of Jiva-siddhi, for the instruction of the disciple, according to the Charvaka philosophy, have been completed with the above-mentioned nine examples, starting with "Vachchakkharam".

## Time Explanation Verse - 33

"Just as a ruby is thrown into milk and illuminates the milk, so too, the soul, residing in the body, illuminates only its own body." 33.

This is an explanation of the example of the body being the only thing that is illuminated. Just as a ruby, when thrown into milk, illuminates the milk with its own light, which is distinct from the milk, so too, the soul, residing in the body, which is rooted in the eternal passions and impurities, illuminates the body with its own parts. Just as the ruby's light intensifies when the milk is heated by fire, and diminishes when the milk cools down, so too, the soul's parts expand when the body is nourished by special food, etc., and contract when the body is deprived of nourishment. Just as the ruby, when thrown into a large quantity of milk, illuminates the entire quantity of milk with its light, so too, the soul, residing in a large body, illuminates the entire body with its parts. Just as the ruby, when thrown into a small quantity of milk, illuminates only the small quantity of milk with its light, so too, the soul, residing in a small body, illuminates only the small body with its parts. 33.

**The Five Astikayas: Natural**

**119 Hindi Time Explanation Verse 33**

**Anvayaartha (As it is)**

Just as (padmaragaratan) a padmaragaratan (khire kshiptam) when placed in milk (kheeram prabhaasayati) illuminates the milk, (tatha) in the same way (dehi) the dehi (jeev) (dehasthah) residing in the body (swadehamaatram prabhaasayati) illuminates only the extent of its own body.

**Commentary:**

This is a statement about the example of the extent of the body.

Just as a padmaragaratan, when placed in milk, pervades that milk with its inseparable group of light, in the same way, the jeev, due to the stain of kshaya from beginningless time, remains in the body obtained due to that stain and is confined to this body by its own regions. And just as, due to many coincidences, when the milk boils, the group of light of the padmaragaratan also boils, i.e., it expands, and when the milk settles, the group of light also settles, in the same way, when the body grows due to specific food, etc., the regions of the jeev expand, and when the body dries up, the regions also contract. Again, just as that padmaragaratan, when placed in more milk, pervades that more milk by the expansion of its group of light, in the same way, the jeev, when it obtains a place in a larger body, pervades that larger body by the expansion of its own regions. And just as that padmaragaratan, when placed in less milk, pervades that less milk by the contraction of its group of light, in the same way, the jeev, when it obtains a place in a smaller body, pervades that smaller body by the contraction of its own regions. ||33||

**Sanskrit Tatparya Vritti Verse 33**

Now, keeping in mind the intention of explaining the subject of the extent of the body, this sutra is presented. Even though this is a distraction, it is appropriate to consider this sutra in mind, or to consider this sutra as the next sutra, and to decide that this sutra is appropriate, and to present this sutra. This is the characteristic of a jnanika, which should be known everywhere as much as possible. Just like a padmaragaratan. Just as a padmaragaratan, the agent, which is made of what? It is placed, thrown, where? In milk, in milk, in milk. What does it do in milk? It illuminates, it illuminates the milk, clearly. So, the dehi, the samsari, residing in the body, illuminates only its own body. For example, here, by the word padmaraga, the light of the padmaragaratan is understood, not the gem itself. Just as the group of light of the padmaragaratan, when placed in milk, pervades that milk, so too, the jeev, while residing in its own body, pervades that body in the present time. Or, just as, due to the coincidence of a specific fire, when the milk increases, the group of light of the padmaragaratan also increases, and when it decreases, it also decreases, so too, due to specific food, when the body increases, the regions of the jeev expand, and when it decreases, they contract. Or, just as that group of light, when placed in more milk, pervades that more milk, and when placed in less milk, pervades that less milk, so too, the jeev, pervading all the substances, qualities, and synonyms of time, which are present in the three worlds and three times, with the light of knowledge and vision, which is capable of pure knowledge and vision, ...

##  Verse 3 of the Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

**The meaning is as follows:**

The pure soul, possessing the miraculous power of consciousness, due to its unique transformations in false beliefs, attachment, aversion, and other modifications, acquires the karma called "body-karma." This body-karma, due to its expansion and contraction caused by its arising, spreads throughout the body of a great fish, measuring thousands of yojanas, when it attains the highest level of pervasiveness.  When it attains the lowest level of pervasiveness, it spreads throughout the body of a tiny nigoda, measuring an infinitesimal fraction of an utsedha-ghana-angula.  And when it attains the middle level of pervasiveness, it spreads throughout bodies of medium size. ||33||

**Verse 34 of the Samaya Vyākhyā Gāthā**

**Pancāstikāya Prābhṛt**

Here, the existence of the soul in different bodies, its distinctness from the body, and the cause of its transmigration are explained.

**The Soul Exists Everywhere, But Is Not One with Any Single Body**

The soul exists everywhere, but it is not one with any single body. It is distinct from the body, like milk in water. The soul is stained by the impurities of karma, and it wanders from body to body because of its karmic actions.

**Explanation**

The soul, in its state of samsara, exists in a continuous stream of bodies. It exists in one body, and then in another, and so on. This is why it is said that the soul exists everywhere. However, the soul is not one with any single body, because it is distinct from the body. The soul is distinct from the body because it is not bound by the body. The soul is bound by karma, and it is this karma that causes it to transmigrate from body to body.

**Commentary**

This verse explains the soul's existence in different bodies, its distinctness from the body, and the cause of its transmigration. The soul exists in a continuous stream of bodies, but it is not one with any single body. The soul is distinct from the body because it is not bound by the body. The soul is bound by karma, and it is this karma that causes it to transmigrate from body to body.

##  Verse 34: Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas in Sanskrit

**This verse explains the existence of the same soul in past, present, and future bodies, its distinctness from the body, and the cause of its transmigration.**

**It says:**

The soul (Jiva) exists everywhere, in all past, present, and future bodies. It is the same soul, not a new one arising as the Charvakas believe. It is not one with the body, nor is it made of the body. Although it appears to be one due to its association with the body, it is not truly one. Why? Because it is like milk and water, one in essence but distinct. Or, the soul exists throughout the body, not in one particular place. Or, from the perspective of subtle senses, there is a multitude of souls in the world. Although they appear to be one due to their similar qualities like omniscience, they are actually distinct, like a heap of gold adorned with different colored clothes and sixteen different colors.

**The cause of transmigration is explained:**

The soul, burdened by the end-results of passions (Aadhyavasana), is stained by the dust of karma and wanders in the cycle of birth and death. Although its true nature is pure and characterized by omniscience and liberation, it is bound by the karmic chains of past actions and is enveloped by the impurities of karma, which are the cause of its attachment to passions. It strives to take birth in a new body, driven by these impurities.

**The verse implies:**

The soul, which is the infinite, pure, and omniscient self, is the one that should be sought after in all situations, especially when facing good and bad thoughts and actions.

**This verse refutes the views of the Mimansakas, Naiyayikas, Sankhyas, and their followers.**

**It emphasizes the importance of understanding the true nature of the soul through the experience of one's own body.**

**The verse also highlights the seven stages of liberation (Samuddhara) mentioned in the previous verse.**

Page #127:
---------------------------
The soul, though it interacts with the body like milk and water, remains distinct from it. It pervades the entire body, not just a part. This means that even though all souls are equal in their inherent qualities of knowledge, perception, etc., they are distinct due to their different karmic accumulations and locations in the universe. Just as gold beads of the same purity are distinct when strung on threads of different colors, so too are souls distinct despite their shared essence. 

Though the soul is inherently pure and possesses only knowledge and perception, it is bound by karmic forces, which manifest as passions, aversions, and other karmic tendencies. These tendencies lead to the accumulation of karmic matter, which obscures the soul's true nature and compels it to take birth in different bodies. 

The soul, being distinct from the body and possessing infinite knowledge and other qualities, is worthy of contemplation, especially when one renounces all desires and aversions. 

To address the doubts of those who follow the Mimamsa, Nyaya, and Sankhya schools of thought, the verse "Vegraṇakasa ya vegubdhiya ya māraṇantiya samugghādo, tejo hāro chaṭo sattamao kevalīṇam tu" (which states that the soul, except for the seven types of aggregates - pain, passions, destructive karmic tendencies, energy, food, and the state of liberation - is shaped by its body) is explained in detail in two verses.

**Verse 35:**

The nature of the soul is not present in the liberated ones, nor is it completely absent. This is because the soul's nature is characterized by the presence of life force and the absence of karmic tendencies. The liberated ones do not have a body, and they transcend the realm of speech and thought.

Description of the six substances and five astikayas, along with the explanation of their unity like water and milk, because they are completely different bodies even after attaining the state of being beyond the reach of words due to the separation of the kṣayās, which are the cause of their connection, and the attainment of the state of being beyond the reach of words, because they are constantly shining with their inherent nature, which is free from all limitations, attained without the support of worldly life-breath and without the connection of the body. || 35 ||
Hindi time explanation verse-35 Anvayaarth-( Yeṣām ) whose ( Jīvasvabhāvaḥ ) jīvasvabhāva ( -prāṇadhāraṇarūpa jīvatva ) ( na asti ) is not and ( sarvathā ) completely ( tasya abhāvaḥ ca ) its absence also is not, ( te ) they ( bhinnadehāḥ ) bodiless ( vāggocaram atītā; ) beyond the reach of words ( siddhāḥ bhavanti ) siddhas ( siddha ) Bhagavants are.
Commentary This is the arrangement of the jīvatva and the body-measure of the siddhas.
The siddhas do not have the jīvasvabhāva as their main form due to the nature of holding the dravya-prāṇa, but they do not have the complete absence of the jīvasvabhāva either, because the main form of the jīvasvabhāva is the existence of the bhāva-prāṇa. And they do not have the same existence as water and milk with the body, because the kṣayās, which are the cause of the connection with the body, and the yoga have been separated, therefore they are completely bodiless even after becoming transformed into the state of being beyond the reach of words and the state of being beyond the reach of the body. And their glory is beyond the reach of words, because they constantly shine (they are shining) with their inherent nature, which is free from all limitations, attained without the support of worldly life-breath and without the connection of the body. || 35 ||

## Pancastikaya Prabhrit Hindi Tatparyavritti Gatha - 35

**Translation:**

It is further stated that pure soulhood belongs to the Siddhas. They are pervading the space only as much as their body-size before or after becoming Siddhas, therefore they are slightly less than their final body-size in terms of practical experience or past logic.

**Meaning with Anvaya:**

[Jesin] Just as [Jivashao] the impure nature of the worldly soul [Natthi] does not remain [Y] but (Tass) the absence of that soul nature [Savvaha] is also not completely absent [Te] they [Bhinnadeha] are separate from all bodies [Vachigoyaramdida] such Siddhas (Hont) are beyond the reach of words.

**Special Meaning:**

The body-bearing soul, which is born from the rise of karma, has the elements of senses and other substances and the essence of life, these essences of life are absent in the Siddhas. Here the disciple doubts that if the elements and the essence of life are not there, then will the soul completely cease to exist as in Buddhism? In response to this doubt, it is said that the true nature of the soul is not destroyed, the pure existence, the pure essence of life in the form of consciousness, knowledge, etc., always remains. Those Siddhas, unlike the pure soul without a body, are devoid of the mind-speech-body yoga and the passions like anger, etc., which are the causes of the birth of the body, therefore they are without a body, they are Siddhas. Even though those Siddhas are devoid of the elements and the essence of life of the world, they remain radiant in their nature. Therefore, their glory or nature cannot be described by our words of limited knowledge. They are the possessors of the eight qualities like right faith, etc., and the infinite qualities included in them, therefore their description is also not possible. Here the meaning is that just as the Saugata, i.e., the Buddhist, seeing the momentary nature of substances, considers its pervasiveness and accepts the momentary nature of substances even in the form of elements, similarly, seeing the absence of the impure soulhood of the ten essences of life, etc., in the state of liberation, he accepts the absence of the pure soul with infinite qualities like pure knowledge, etc., as well. 35.

**Samaya Vyakhya Gatha - 36**

**Translation:**

This is the negation of the cause-and-effect relationship of the Siddha.

**Meaning:**

But from where is it born, because the action is not done by it, so it is not a Siddha.

It does not produce anything, because the cause is not there, so it is not a Siddha. 36.

## 126
## Six Substances - Description of the Five Astikayas

**Since the Siddha is not produced from any cause, he is not a product. Since he does not produce anything, he is not a cause either.** || 36 ||

Just as the samsari jiva is born in the form of a deva, man, animal, or hell being, due to the causal chain of his own karma-formed atma-parinama and the causal chain of karma-formed pudgala-parinama, so too is the Siddha born in the same way - this is not the case. The Siddha, with the destruction of both karmas, is born of himself, not from any other cause. Just as the samsari jiva, being a cause, produces the effects of his own karma-formed atma-parinama and karma-formed pudgala-parinama, and thus produces the effects of deva, man, animal, and hell being, so too does the Siddha produce his own form - this is not the case. The Siddha, with the destruction of both karmas, produces only himself, not anything else.

**Hindi Explanation of the Verse - 36**

**Anvaya-artha:** (Yasmat sa Siddha) The Siddha (kutashchit api) is not born from (anya) any other (karan) cause. (Tena) Therefore, (karyam na) he is not a (kary) product, and (kinchit api) he does not produce (anya karyako) any other (utpadayati) product. (Tena) Therefore, (sa) he (karanam api) is not a (na bhavati) cause either.

**Tika:** This negates the existence of a cause-and-effect relationship for the Siddha.

Just as the samsari jiva is born in the form of a deva, man, animal, or hell being, due to the causal chain of his own karma-formed atma-parinama and the causal chain of karma-formed pudgala-parinama, so too is the Siddha born in the same way - this is not the case. The Siddha (Siddha Bhagavan) is actually born of himself, with the destruction of both karmas, and is not born from any other cause (karma-formed atma or karma-formed pudgala).

Furthermore, just as the samsari jiva, being a cause, produces the effects of his own karma-formed atma-parinama and karma-formed pudgala-parinama, and thus produces the effects of deva, man, animal, and hell being, so too does the Siddha produce his own form - this is not the case. The Siddha is actually born of himself, with the destruction of both karmas, and does not produce anything else (karma-formed atma-pudgala or the effects of deva, etc.). || 36 ||

**Sanskrit Tatparya-vritti of the Verse - 36**

Now, the verse establishes the absence of a cause-and-effect relationship for the Siddha, in comparison to karma. The samsari jiva, who is born from a cause, is not born at any time in the form of a man, hell being, etc. Because - (Yasmat karanat) from what cause, (kajjam na tena so Siddha) the Siddha is not a product due to that cause, (utpadedi na kinnivi) he does not produce anything, (svayam karma-na-karma-rupam kim api na utpadayati) he does not produce anything in the form of karma or non-karma, (karanam iha tena na so hodita) therefore, he is not a cause.

## Pancastikaya Prabhrit 127

**Verse 36:**

"Even with respect to karma and non-karma, there is no cause or effect." This gatha sutra implies that one who is firmly convinced that there is no cause or effect with respect to karma and non-karma, is the one who possesses infinite knowledge and other qualities. Such a being is directly worthy of being attained when the mind, speech, and body cease their activities, which are the cause of the arising of karma and the acceptance of new karma.

**Hindi Commentary:**

Verse 36 of the Uththānika section further shows that the liberated soul is not the effect of karma or non-karma, nor is it the cause of them.

**General Meaning with Anvaya:**

(Jamha) Because (kudochi vi) from no one (uppannno na) has been born (tena) therefore (so siddho) that liberated soul (kajjana) is not an effect. And (kinchi vi) to no one (na upppadedi) does it give birth (tena) therefore (sa) this liberated soul (karanam avi) is also not a cause.

**Specific Meaning:**

Just as worldly beings are born in various forms like humans, hell beings, etc., due to the arising of karma, the liberated soul is not born from the arising of karma or non-karma. Therefore, they are not the effect of anything, nor do they themselves give rise to any karmic bondage or produce a body made of non-karma. Therefore, the liberated soul is not a cause with respect to karma and non-karma. In this gatha sutra, whoever is firmly convinced that there is no cause or effect with respect to karma and non-karma, is the one who possesses infinite knowledge and other qualities. Such a being is directly worthy of being attained when the mind, speech, and body cease their activities, which are the cause of the arising of karma and the acceptance of new karma.

**Commentary on Time:**

**Verse 37:**

Here, the idea that the absence of a soul is liberation is refuted.

**Satsad:**

"Eternal, annihilation, future, non-future, void, and other things. Knowledge and ignorance are not applicable to a non-existent nature."

**Explanation:**

"Substance is eternal in its own nature. In an eternal substance, there is annihilation of transformations at every moment. Substance is always destined to become future transformations. Substance is always destined to not become past transformations. Substance is always void of other substances."

Page #132:
---------------------------
## Verse 128:

**Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**

A substance is always non-zero with respect to its own substance. Sometimes, in a living being, there is infinite knowledge, and sometimes there is finite knowledge. Sometimes, in a living being, there is infinite ignorance, and sometimes there is finite ignorance. This, being otherwise impossible, reveals the existence of the soul in liberation. ||37||

Page #133:
---------------------------
##  Refutation of the Buddhist View of Liberation as the Absence of a Jiva

**Verse 37 of the Hindi Commentary on the Uththanika**

This verse refutes the Buddhist view that liberation is the absence of a jiva (soul).

**General Meaning with Anvaya (Word Order):**

(Sassa-dam) Eternal existence (ay) and (ucchedam) destruction (bhavya-m) being worthy of liberation (cha) and (abhavya-m) being unworthy of liberation, (sunna-m) emptiness (cha) and (idaram) non-emptiness (vipanan-am) knowledge (avinna-nam) and non-knowledge (sambhave asadi) the existence of the liberated jiva is not present (na vi jujjhadi) cannot be.

**Specific Meaning:**

The existence of the liberated soul (Siddh Bhagwan) is eternal. This is why the following eight characteristics are inherent in them:

1. **Eternal Existence (Shaashvatapana):**  They are eternally existent in their single nature of being the knower and seer, as revealed by their Tanko-tkirna (perfect) knowledge. They are not destroyed.
2. **Destruction (Ucched or Vyayapana):**  Due to the nature of Paryayas (states of existence), there is always destruction of Paryayas in relation to the six states (Shat-Sthan) and the increase and decrease of the subtle and gross qualities. This destruction is inseparable from creation. This creation and destruction is the nature of every Paryaya of every substance.
3. **Worthy of Liberation (Bhavya-pana):**  They are eternally evolving in their single nature of being pure knowledge and bliss (Chidananda-maya), free from all impurities. This is their inherent nature of being worthy of liberation.
4. **Unworthy of Liberation (Abhavya-pana):**  They will never evolve into the states of past falsehood, attachment, and other impure states (Vibhava-parinama) in their liberated state. This absence of these states is their inherent nature of being unworthy of liberation.
5. **Emptiness (Sunya-pana):**  They are devoid of the fourfold external reality (Paradravya, Parakshetra, Parakal, Parabhava) which are distinct from their pure nature. This absence of the external reality is their inherent emptiness.
6. **Non-Emptiness (Ashunya-pana):**  They possess the fourfold internal reality (Nijadravya, Nijakshetra, Nijakal, Nijabhava) which is related to their supreme self. They are never devoid of their pure qualities.
7. **Knowledge (Vijnana):**  They are complete and pure in their perfect knowledge (Kevalgyan) which illuminates all substances, qualities, and states of existence at once.
8. **Non-Knowledge (Avinnana):**  They are devoid of the impure knowledge (Vibhava-rupa) such as limited knowledge (Mati-gyana), destruction (Kshaya), and delusion (Upshama).

Therefore, these eight characteristics (eternal existence, destruction, worthy of liberation, unworthy of liberation, emptiness, non-emptiness, knowledge, and non-knowledge) cannot be established if the existence of the jiva is not accepted in liberation. They are established only when the jiva exists. The existence of these characteristics proves the existence of the pure jiva in liberation. This verse implies that only the pure jiva is worthy of being attained.

##  Verse 130: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

Thus, in accordance with the views of Bhatta Charvaka, three verses have been completed, stating the immateriality of the soul to destroy the arguments of his disciples. || 37 ||

**Verse 38: Explanation of the Quality of Consciousness**

The fruit of karma is one, the action is one, and knowledge is one. The living being is conscious in three ways. || 38 ||

**Explanation:**

This verse explains the quality of consciousness.

Some conscious beings, i.e., souls, are extremely polluted by delusion and whose power is sealed by a very strong veil of ignorance, are primarily conscious of the fruit of karma, which is in the form of pleasure and pain. This is because their ability to act (to become transformed into the form of karma-consciousness) has been destroyed by a very strong obstacle to their energy.

Other conscious beings, i.e., souls, who are extremely polluted by delusion and whose power is sealed by a strong veil of ignorance, are primarily conscious of action, even though it is accompanied by the experience of the fruit of karma in the form of pleasure and pain. This is because their ability to act (to become transformed into the form of karma-consciousness) has been weakened by a moderate obstacle to their energy.

Still others, whose entire delusion has been washed away, whose veil of ignorance has been completely removed, and whose entire power has been completely unsealed, are conscious only of knowledge, because they have completely exhausted the fruit of karma and have become completely free from action. They experience natural, inherent happiness. || 38 ||

**Hindi Explanation of Verse 38:**

**Anvaya:** [Trividhena chetakbhaavena] By three types of consciousness, [ekah jeevarashih] one living being, [karmaanām phalam] is the fruit of karma, [ekah tu] one living being, [kāryam] is action, [karmachetanaako] (ath) and [ekah] one living being, [jñānam] is knowledge, [chetayati] is conscious (knows).

**Commentary:**

This is the explanation of the quality of consciousness.

Some conscious beings, i.e., souls, are extremely polluted by delusion and whose power (strength) is sealed by a very strong veil of ignorance, are primarily conscious of the fruit of karma, which is in the form of pleasure and pain. This is because their ability to act (to become transformed into the form of karma-consciousness) has been destroyed by a very strong obstacle to their energy.

Other conscious beings, i.e., souls, who are extremely polluted by delusion and whose power is sealed by a strong veil of ignorance, are primarily conscious of action, even though it is accompanied by the experience of the fruit of karma in the form of pleasure and pain. This is because their ability to act (to become transformed into the form of karma-consciousness) has been weakened by a moderate obstacle to their energy.

Page #135:
---------------------------
**Verse 38**

Those who have attained the ability to perform the work of destroying and pacifying the minor obstacles to their efforts, primarily experience the "work" [karma-consciousness] mixed with experience. 

The other experiencer, i.e., the soul, who has attained infinite energy due to the destruction of all obstacles to effort, experiences the natural happiness-like knowledge, which is inseparable from itself, through the nature of the experiencer, due to the destruction of all obscuring karmic stains, the destruction of all knowledge-obscuring karmic stains, the full development of all powers, the elimination of the fruits of karma, and the attainment of complete fulfillment. ||38||

## Description of the Six-Sense and Five-Sense Beings

**Verse 39:** This verse explains what each being experiences. All beings, indeed, experience the fruits of their karma. The stationary beings experience the fruits of their karma, the mobile beings experience the fruits of their karma along with their actions, and the liberated souls experience knowledge.

**Commentary:** Here, it is explained what each being experiences (i.e., what kind of consciousness they have). "Experiences," "perceives," "achieves," and "knows" all have the same meaning, as consciousness, perception, achievement, and knowledge all have the same meaning. There, the stationary beings experience the fruits of their karma, the mobile beings experience the fruits of their karma along with their actions, and the liberated souls experience knowledge.

**Meaning:** The five types of stationary beings experience the fruits of their karma in the form of subtle happiness and suffering. The mobile beings with two senses and above experience the same fruits of their karma along with their actions, which are in the form of desires and aversions. The liberated souls, who have perfect knowledge, experience only knowledge (along with infinite bliss).

**Sanskrit Commentary:** Here, it is explained what each being experiences. What is the meaning of "explains"? In response to this question, the word "all" should be understood in the context of this question-and-answer format. All beings, indeed, experience the fruits of their karma. These are the five types of stationary beings. The stationary beings experience the fruits of their karma in the form of subtle happiness and suffering. The mobile beings with two senses and above experience the same fruits of their karma along with their actions, which are in the form of desires and aversions. The liberated souls, who have perfect knowledge, experience only knowledge (along with infinite bliss).

Page #137:
---------------------------
**Verse 39**

The five-sense beings and above, up to the 133rd category, experience the fruits of their karma, which are both the action and its result. Those who are devoid of life senses also experience the fruits of their karma. However, the liberated souls, having transcended the ten types of life, experience only pure knowledge due to their unwavering state of bliss and oneness with the supreme bliss. This is the meaning of the two verses.

**Verse 40**

The use of knowledge is twofold: knowledge and perception. The soul always experiences this use of knowledge, which is the transformation of consciousness. This use of knowledge is also twofold: the use of knowledge and the use of perception.

Page #138:
---------------------------
## 134
**Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**

There, knowledge is that which grasps the particular, and perception is that which grasps the general. And use is always inseparable from the soul, because it is constituted by one existence. ||4||

Page #139:
---------------------------
The use of the five senses, such as the use of the hand to pick up an object, is called "Panchaastikaya Praabhrut Upayog". The use that involves choice is called "Gyaanopyog", and the use that is without choice is called "Darshanopyog". The living being exists with both these uses. This use is always inseparable from the living being, it is one, although it is different in terms of name, characteristics, purpose, etc. ||4||

This is how the two types of use, Gyaan and Darshan, are explained. A verse is spoken to inform about this.

Time Explanation Verse-41: This is the name and form of the special Gyaanopyog.

(Aabhinibodhik, Shruta, Avadhi, Manahparyaya, Kevala) These are the five types of Gyaan.

(Kumati, Shruta, Vibhang) These three are also connected with Gyaan. ||14||

(Aabhinibodhik, Shruta, Avadhi, Manahparyaya, Kevala) These are the five types of Gyaan.

(Kumati, Shruta, Vibhang) These three are also connected with Gyaan. ||41||

There are names for these: Aabhinibodhik Gyaan, Shruta Gyaan, Avadhi Gyaan, Manahparyaya Gyaan, Kevala Gyaan, Kumati Gyaan, Kushruta Gyaan, Vibhang Gyaan. The soul is the pure Gyaan that pervades all the regions of the soul. This soul, being covered by the karma of ignorance, when it perceives the gross and subtle substances with its senses, due to the destruction of the covering, the calming of the senses, and the dependence on the senses, it is called Aabhinibodhik Gyaan. When it perceives the gross and subtle substances with its senses, due to the destruction of the covering, the calming of the senses, and the dependence on the senses, it is called Shruta Gyaan. When it perceives the gross substances with its senses, due to the destruction of the covering and the calming of the senses, it is called Avadhi Gyaan. When it perceives the gross substances in the mind of another, due to the destruction of the covering and the calming of the senses, it is called Manahparyaya Gyaan. When it perceives all the gross and subtle substances completely, due to the complete destruction of all the coverings, it is called Kevala Gyaan. Aabhinibodhik Gyaan, which is accompanied by the rise of false views, is called Kumati Gyaan. Shruta Gyaan, which is accompanied by the rise of false views, is called Kushruta Gyaan. Avadhi Gyaan, which is accompanied by the rise of false views, is called Vibhang Gyaan. This is the name and form of these. Thus, the eight types of Gyaanopyog, starting with Mati Gyaan, have been explained. ||4||

Hindi Time Explanation Verse-41: Anvayaarth - (Aabhinibodhik, Shruta, Avadhi, Manahparyaya, Kevala) Aabhinibodhik (Mati), Shruta, Avadhi, Manahparyaya, and Kevala (Gyaanani Panchabhedani) Thus, there are five types of Gyaan.

##  Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas, Verse 3 (Delusions, False Knowledge, and Distortions)

**Verse 3:**  Delusion, false knowledge, and distortion [all three] are also combined with the five types of knowledge [thus there are eight types of knowledge utilization].

**Commentary:** This explains the names and nature of the different types of knowledge utilization. There are (1) Intuitive Knowledge, (2) Scriptural Knowledge, (3) Clairvoyance, (4) Telepathic Knowledge, (5) Omniscience, (6) Delusion, (7) False Knowledge, and (8) Distorted Knowledge - these are the names of the different types of knowledge utilization.

**Now, their nature is explained:** The soul is truly infinite, pervading all soul-regions, and is pure knowledge by nature. Being veiled by the karma of knowledge-obscuration, it experiences (1) Intuitive Knowledge, which is the perception of concrete and abstract substances in a distorted way, due to the weakening of the veil of knowledge and the dependence on the senses and mind; (2) Scriptural Knowledge, which is the perception of concrete and abstract substances in a distorted way, due to the weakening of the veil of knowledge and the dependence on the mind; (3) Clairvoyance, which is the perception of concrete substances in a distorted way, due to the weakening of the veil of knowledge; (4) Telepathic Knowledge, which is the perception of concrete substances related to other minds in a distorted way, due to the weakening of the veil of knowledge; (5) Omniscience, which is the natural perception of concrete and abstract substances in their entirety, due to the complete destruction of all veils. (6) Delusion is Intuitive Knowledge arising with the rise of false belief; (7) False Knowledge is Scriptural Knowledge arising with the rise of false belief; (8) Distorted Knowledge is Clairvoyance arising with the rise of false belief. Thus, the nature of the different types of knowledge utilization is explained. In this way, the eight types of knowledge utilization, starting with Intuitive Knowledge, have been explained.

**Verse 41:**  Now, the names of the different types of knowledge utilization are explained: Intuitive Knowledge, Scriptural Knowledge, Clairvoyance, Telepathic Knowledge, and Omniscience are the five types of knowledge. Delusion, False Knowledge, and Distorted Clairvoyance are the three types of false knowledge. The meaning here is: Just as the sun, veiled by clouds, appears to be divided into many parts, so too, the soul, which is truly one and undivided in its nature, appears to be divided into many parts due to the veil of karma, as it experiences different types of knowledge, starting with Intuitive Knowledge.

**Verse 41:** This verse explains the names of the eight types of knowledge utilization.

The five types of knowledge, starting with *panchaastikaya*, along with their meanings and explanations (including *aabhini sadho thi manakevalaani*): *mati*, *shruta*, *avadhi*, *manahparyaya*, and *kevala* (these five are called *panchabheyaani*). These five are the different forms (called *naanaani*) of right knowledge. There are eight types of knowledge in total, which are combined (called *sanjutte*) with three types of ignorance (called *kumadhisudavibhangani*): *kumati*, *kushrut*, and *vibhanga* [these three are called *tinni vi naanehi*].

**Specific Meaning:** Just as the sun is one, but its light appears different due to the covering of clouds, similarly, the soul is also whole and one in its true nature, but it appears to be different due to the coverings of karma. Therefore, there are many types of knowledge, such as *sumati* knowledge, etc.

**End of the verse explaining the eight types of knowledge.** The next six verses do not have any commentary available, so they are presented separately from 1 to 6.

**Verse 1 of the Sanskrit Commentary:** Now, the five types of knowledge, starting with *mati*, are explained in five verses. As follows:

*mati* knowledge is threefold: *uvaladdhi*, *bhavana*, and *uavogo*. It is also fourfold, with *darshanapuvva* being the first.

**Verse 1 of the Hindi Commentary:** The next five verses explain the nature of the five types of knowledge, starting with *mati*. These verses are not found in the commentary by Amrit Chandra.

*mati* knowledge is threefold: *uvaladdhi*, *uavogo*, and *bhavana*.

## Six Substances - Description of the Five Astikayas
(**Cha Bhavanam**) And contemplation, the thought of what is known. (**Tahu Ev**) Similarly, it (**Chaduviyappam**) is of four types. (**Darshanpukh**) With the knowledge of perception (**Ganam**) this knowledge (**Havdi**) happens.

**Special Meaning:** This soul, according to the principle of certainty, is an undivided, pure, knowledge-filled entity. According to the principle of practical application, it is covered by karmas in the state of the world. When the karma of the knowledge-obscuring covering is destroyed or subdued, the knowledge that arises through the five senses and the mind, which knows both concrete and abstract objects with or without alternatives or distinctions, is called **mati-jnana**. It is of three types: the power to know objects that is obtained through the destruction or subduing of the knowledge-obscuring covering karma is called **upalabdhi mati-jnana**. "This is blue, this is yellow," etc., the activity of knowing an object in this way is called **upayoga mati-jnana**. Repeatedly thinking about the known object is **bhavana mati-jnana**. This **mati-jnana** is of four types, based on the distinctions of **avagraha**, **iha**, **avaya**, and **dharana**. Alternatively, it is also of four types: **kostha-buddhi**, **bija-buddhi**, **padanusari buddhi**, and **sambhinna-srotrita buddhi**. This **mati-jnana** happens with the perception of the form of existence. The implication here is that the **mati-jnana** that is in front of the pure soul, which is free from modifications, according to the principle of certainty, is the one that is worthy of being adopted, as it is the means to infinite happiness. The external **mati-jnana** that is its means is worthy of being adopted according to the principle of practical application. || 1 ||

**Verse 2 of the Sanskrit Commentary:**

**Sudanaan Pun Naani Bhanthi Laddiyaa Bhavanaa Chev. Uvaoganayaviyappam Naanena Ya Vatthu Atthass ||2||**

**Sudanaan Pun Naani Bhanthi** - The wise ones say that the soul, as mentioned earlier, when the karma of the knowledge-obscuring covering is destroyed or subdued, knows concrete and abstract objects indirectly. This is again called **shruta-jnana**. **Tacc Kathambhuttam?** - How is it? **Laddi Ya Bhavanaa Chev** - It is in the form of attainment and contemplation. **Punaravi Kimvishistam?** - What is its special characteristic? **Uvaoganayaviyappam** - It is the alternative of application and the alternative of principle. Here, the word **upayoga** refers to the evidence that grasps the object, and the word **naya** refers to the alternative of the knower, which grasps a part of the object. Thus, it is said: **Nayo Jnaturabhipraayah**. **Kena Kritva Vastugrahakam Pramanam Vastvekadeeshagrahako Naya Iti Chet?** - What is the evidence that grasps the object, and what is the principle that grasps a part of the object? **Naanena Ya** - It is said that the evidence is the knower, the distinguisher, the grasper, and **Vatthu Atthass** - the grasper of all objects. **Arthasya Vastvekadeeshasya, Kathambhutasy?** - What is the nature of the part of the object that is grasped by the principle? It is the principle that grasps the object in the form of its qualities and synonyms. Here, the implication is that the pure soul, which is of the nature of pure knowledge and perception, is worthy of being adopted in certainty, as it is the means to the supreme soul, which is the essence of the three jewels of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct. The external means is worthy of being adopted in practical application. || 2 ||

**139**

**Anvaya Saha Samaanyarth -** (Pun) Then (Naani) the Knowers (Sudanaanam) call Shruta Jnana (Bhaanti) as (Vaththu Atyass Naanena Tha) knowing the object and its essence (Ladhi Ya Bhavanaa Chev Uvoga Nayaviyappam) there are distinctions in that Shruta Jnana like Labdhi, Bhavana, Upayoga and Nay.

**Vishesharth -** The same soul which had known the object through Mati Jnana, when the Shruta Jnana Avaraniya Karma is destroyed and subsided, then the one who knows the concrete and abstract objects, is called Shruta Jnana by the Knowers. That Shruta Jnana which is in the form of attainment of power is Labdhi, which is in the form of repeated contemplation is Bhavana. There are two more distinctions in it, Upayoga and Nay. By the word Upayoga, one should take the knowledge of the evidence which takes the object, and by the word Nay, one should take only the intention of the knower who takes the object in one aspect, because it is said - "Nayoh Jnaturabhipraayah" that Nay is only the intention of the knower. Knowing the object in all its forms, which is in the form of Guna Paryaya, is Praman, and knowing only one Guna or one Paryaya mainly is Nay. Here, the meaning is that the pure Jnana Darshan, which is the nature of pure Atmik Tattva, which is the cause of the Paramatma Tattva which is to be taken, is to be taken with certainty, and in the form of Samyak Shraddha, Jnana and Acharan, which is the Abhed Ratna Trayaroop Bhava Shruta. And in the practical Nay, one should take the Dravya Shruta, which is the cause of this Bhava Shruta Jnana. ||2||

**Tinnivi Gunena Niyama Bhavena Desam Taha Niyadam.** ||3||

**Ohim Tava Gheppadu -** This Avaradhi Jnana, when the Avaradhi Jnana Avarana Karma is destroyed and subsided, becomes the knowledge of the concrete object which is known through direct perception, as previously explained, the Shruta Jnana is of three types - Labdhi, Bhavana and Upayoga, similarly, you should take and know this Avaradhi, leaving out Bhavana, in three ways. **Desam Param Cha Ohim Savvam Cha** - Or, the Avaradhi Jnana is of three types - Desha Avaradhi, Parama Avaradhi and Sarva Avaradhi, but the Parama Avaradhi and Sarva Avaradhi are for those who are filled with the joy of Chid Uchchalan, who have tasted the nectar of supreme bliss, who are in the state of Sama Rasa Bhava, and who have attained the ultimate body of Tapa. And it is said - "Paramohi Savvahi Charamasarirasas Viradasa" - **Tinnivi Gunena Niyama -** All three Avaradhis are with certainty due to the special Samyaktavadi Guna. **Bhavena Desam Taha Niyadam -** The meaning is that the Avaradhi of Devas and Narakas is the Desha Avaradhi by the rule of Bhava Pratyaya. ||3||

**Vishesharth -** The Avadhijnana is that which, upon the destruction and cessation of the Avadhijnana Avarana Karma, knows the material objects directly. Just as before, the Shrutajnana was described in three ways, namely, the attainment, the feeling, and the use, similarly, the Avadhijnana, leaving aside the feeling, is of the nature of attainment and use. The power of Avadhijnana is that attainment, the bending of the Chetan towards that is the use, and its three divisions are also known, namely, Deshavadhi, Paramavadhi, and Sarvavadhi. But out of these three, the Paramavadhi and Sarvavadhi knowledge is attained by those liberated souls, the monks, who are on the path of liberation, who are full of the feeling of Chetan and are immersed in the state of perfect harmony, the taste of the nectar of supreme bliss. As the saying goes, "Paramohi Savvohi Charamasharirasya Viradasa." All these three Avadhijnanas are attained by the rules due to the qualities like Samyagdarshan, etc. And the Bhava Pratyay Avadhi, that is, the Avadhi which is attained due to the birth of Devas and Narakas, is by the rule, only Deshavadhi. This is the meaning. 3.

## Chapter 142: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas, but Only Knowledge is One

**Verse 5:**

The description of the six substances and five astikayas is given, but only knowledge is one. The five types of knowledge (mati, shruta, avadhi, mana, and kevala) are explained in terms of their differences, but these are for practical purposes. In reality, the soul is the light of one, undivided knowledge, just like the sun without clouds.

**Commentary:**

This verse concludes the explanation of the five types of knowledge (mati, shruta, avadhi, mana, and kevala). The commentary emphasizes that these distinctions are for practical purposes and that in reality, there is only one, undivided knowledge. The soul is the light of this knowledge, just like the sun without clouds.

**Verse 6:**

The three types of ignorance are described:

* **Michchhatta:** Wrong belief, which arises from the false perception of substances.
* **Annan:** Non-knowledge, which is the absence of knowledge.
* **Avirati:** Non-restraint, which is the lack of control over the senses.

**Commentary:**

This verse describes the three types of ignorance: wrong belief, non-knowledge, and non-restraint. These are the obstacles to attaining liberation.

**Explanation:**

* **Michchhatta:** Wrong belief arises from the false perception of substances. This is the belief that the soul is the body, or that the world is permanent.
* **Annan:** Non-knowledge is the absence of knowledge. This is the lack of understanding of the true nature of reality.
* **Avirati:** Non-restraint is the lack of control over the senses. This is the inability to resist the temptations of the world.

These three types of ignorance are the root cause of suffering. By overcoming them, one can attain liberation.

Page #147:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

**Pancastikaya Prabhrut**

143. Just as ignorance and non-restraint exist, so too do good and bad conduct, and valid and invalid knowledge. When does this happen? During the time of contemplation of the truth. Why? Because of reliance on perception. What is the object of this? The knowable, which is the soul and its attributes. Here, the opposite of falsehood, the faith in the true meaning, is the cause of the certainty of right conduct, which is the practical right conduct. Its result is the certainty of right conduct, which is characterized by the experience of the pure, unchanging self. This is the meaning. || 6 ||

**Hindi Tatparya Vritti Gatha 6**

The next three types of ignorance are:

**Anvaya Sahit Samanyarth (Michchhatta)**

The knowledge that arises from the false view of substance (Annanam) is in the form of ignorance, i.e., wrong understanding, wrong knowledge, and fragmented knowledge (Aviradibhavo Ya). There is also the absence of vows (Bhavaranana). In the same way, during the time of contemplation of the truth, relying on the knowable, which is the soul and its attributes (Neyam Paducc Kale), good conduct becomes bad conduct, and valid knowledge becomes invalid knowledge (Dunyay Duppamanam Cha). The meaning here is that the opposite of falsehood, the faith in the true meaning, which is the practical right conduct, and which is the cause of the certainty of right conduct, or whose result is the certainty of right conduct, which is characterized by the experience of the pure, unchanging self, both are worthy of being adopted. || 6 ||

**Samaya Vyakhya Gatha 42**

This is the naming and description of the specific uses of vision. Vision is also classified as having eyes, not having eyes, and being accompanied by clairvoyance. It is also classified as being non-material, infinite in scope, and being pure knowledge. || 42 ||

**Darsanam Api Chakshur Yutam Api Cha Avadhina Sahitam**

Vision is also classified as having eyes, not having eyes, being accompanied by clairvoyance, and being pure knowledge. || 42 ||

The names are: vision with eyes, vision without eyes, vision with clairvoyance, and pure vision. The soul is inherently infinite, pervading all parts of the self, and pure vision. Due to the obscuring of its parts by the karmic veil of ignorance, which is beginningless, the soul, being obscured by the karmic veil, perceives the material world in a fragmented way through the sense of sight. This is vision with eyes. When the karmic veil is removed, and the soul perceives the material and non-material world in a fragmented way through the other four senses, excluding sight, this is vision without eyes. When the karmic veil is removed, and the soul perceives the material world in a fragmented way, this is vision with clairvoyance.

Page #148:
---------------------------
## Chapter 144: Description of the Six Substances, Five Astikayas, and the Four Types of Vision

**Verse 42:**

The description of the four types of vision: **Chakshu Darshan** (vision with eyes), **Achakshu Darshan** (vision without eyes), **Avadhi Darshan** (clairvoyance), and **Kevala Darshan** (omniscience).

**Commentary:**

This verse describes the names and nature of the different types of vision.

* **Chakshu Darshan:** Vision through the eyes.
* **Achakshu Darshan:** Vision through other senses and the mind.
* **Avadhi Darshan:** Clairvoyance, the ability to see beyond the limitations of the physical senses.
* **Kevala Darshan:** Omniscience, the complete and perfect knowledge of all things, past, present, and future.

The soul is inherently infinite and pervades all realms. However, due to the obscuring effects of karma, it experiences a limited perception of reality.

* **Chakshu Darshan:** When the obscurations of **Chakshu Darshan** are diminished, the soul perceives the material world through the eyes, but only in a limited and imperfect way.
* **Achakshu Darshan:** When the obscurations of **Achakshu Darshan** are diminished, the soul perceives both the material and non-material world through other senses and the mind, but still in a limited and imperfect way.
* **Avadhi Darshan:** When the obscurations of **Avadhi Darshan** are diminished, the soul perceives the material world directly, without the limitations of the physical senses.
* **Kevala Darshan:** When all obscurations are completely eliminated, the soul attains **Kevala Darshan**, the state of omniscience, and perceives all things in their entirety, without any limitations.

This is the description of the different types of vision.

Page #149:

## Pancastikaya Prabhrut
145. The Keval Darshan is said to be. Here, the meaning is that the pure Jiva Astikaya, which is the basis of infinite qualities inseparable from Keval Darshan, is the only one capable of possessing them. ||42||

Thus, the explanation of the use of Darshan is mainly contained in the Gatha.

**Hindi Tatparya Vritti Gatha-42** further explains the names and nature of the different types of Darshan use.

**Anvaya Sahit Samanyarth** - [Darshanam] Darshan (avi) also (chakkhujurda) with eyes (avi) and [achakkhujurdam] without eyes (ya) and [ohinasahyam] with Avadhi (chavi) similarly (anidharna antarahit [anantavisayam] infinite subject matter (keliyam) with Keval (pannatam) is said to be.

**Vishesharth** - There are four types of Darshan use, namely - Chakshu, Achakshu, Avadhi and Keval. Although the soul inherently possesses an infinite and undivided nature of Darshan, due to the karmas that bind it, it is covered by the Chakshu Darshan Avarana karma. This karma is destroyed by the cessation of the Chakshu Darshan Avarana karma, and the soul, through the external sense organ called Chakshu, sees only the existence of material objects without any modifications. This is called Chakshu Darshan. Similarly, when the Avarana karma of the other four senses, the mind, and the non-sense organs is destroyed, the soul, through the external sense organs of touch, etc., and the mind, sees the existence of material and immaterial objects without any modifications. This is called Achakshu Darshan. When the Avadhi Darshan Avarana karma is destroyed, the soul directly sees the existence of material objects without any modifications. This is called Avadhi Darshan. When the Keval Darshan Avarana karma is destroyed due to the power of the pure soul's experience of the undivided nature of pure consciousness and bliss, free from the defects of attachment, etc., the soul sees the existence of all objects in the three worlds and the three times simultaneously. This is called Keval Darshan, which is the natural ability to perceive the existence of infinite objects. Here, the meaning is that the pure Jiva Astikaya, which is the basis of infinite qualities inseparable from Keval Darshan, is the only one capable of possessing them. ||42||

In this way, the Gatha explains the use of Darshan.

**Verse 3 of the Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**
**Verse 43 of the Time Explanation**

This is the support for the fact that one soul has many kinds of knowledge.
The knower is not separate from knowledge, knowledge is many, not one.
Therefore, the substance is called the universal form by the knowers. || 53 ||

The knower is not separate from knowledge, because both are made of one existence, and therefore are one substance, because both have an inseparable region, and therefore are one field, because both are created at the same time, and therefore are one time, because both have the same nature, and therefore are one essence. And even when this is said, many kinds of knowledge, such as insight (mati), do not contradict each other in one soul, because the substance is universal (multifaceted). The substance is truly infinite in form, because it is the basis of infinite qualities that occur together and infinite categories that occur in sequence. Therefore, even though it is one, it is called the universal form (multifaceted). || 43 ||

Page #151:
---------------------------
The five astikayas are not distinct. There are many different types of knowledge, such as mati, jnana, etc. Because there are many different types of knowledge, the universe is described as having many forms. What is it? It is the jiva dravya. Who said this? The jnanis, those who have knowledge of the principles of heya and upadeya. As such, just as there is no difference between a paramāṇu and its qualities like color, etc., because it is one in essence, one in substance, one in space, one in time, and one in nature, so too there is no difference between the jiva dravya and its qualities like knowledge, etc., because it is one in essence, one in substance, one in space, one in time, and one in nature. Alternatively, in relation to the pure jiva, there is no difference between the pure jiva and its qualities like infinite knowledge, etc., because it is one in essence, one in substance, one in space, one in time, and one in nature. This is the meaning.

Page #152:
---------------------------
## Chapter 148: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

**Verse 43:**

A substance is simply existence. Space is a substance because it is an infinite, indivisible, pure, and unified region. Time is a substance because it is a mere consequence of the continuous flow of the unchanging, conscious, and miraculous. Nature is a substance because it is a pure, unified, and luminous consciousness. The pure soul is not different from its infinite qualities, such as pure knowledge, etc., in any way.

**Verse 44:**

**Commentary:**

If a substance is different from its qualities, and qualities are different from the substance, then this leads to a contradiction. If it is said that a substance is different from its qualities, and qualities are different from the substance, then it leads to the conclusion that there are infinite substances or that there is no substance at all.

**Explanation:**

Qualities are always dependent on something. The thing they depend on is the substance. If the substance is different from the qualities, then the qualities will also be dependent on something else. This will lead to an infinite regress. Therefore, if a substance is different from its qualities, then there will be an infinite number of substances.

On the other hand, if qualities are different from the substance, then there will be no substance at all. Because a substance is a collection of qualities, and if the qualities are different from the collection, then what is the collection?

**Hindi Commentary:**

**Meaning:** If a substance is different from its qualities, and qualities are different from the substance, then this leads to a contradiction. If it is said that a substance is different from its qualities, and qualities are different from the substance, then it leads to the conclusion that there are infinite substances or that there is no substance at all.

**Explanation:**

This is a contradiction. Qualities are always dependent on something. The thing they depend on is the substance. If the substance is different from the qualities, then the qualities will also be dependent on something else. This will lead to an infinite regress. Therefore, if a substance is different from its qualities, then there will be an infinite number of substances.

On the other hand, if qualities are different from the substance, then there will be no substance at all. Because a substance is a collection of qualities, and if the qualities are different from the collection, then what is the collection?

Page #153:
---------------------------
**Verse 44**

The five-fold categories, beginning with the substance, are in reality a collection of qualities. If the qualities are different from the collection, then what will remain of the collection? That is, nothing will remain. In this way, if the qualities are different from the substance, then the substance is absent.

**Commentary**

This verse points out the flaw in the idea that substance and qualities are distinct. If substance is different from qualities, then either there would be an infinite number of substances, or substance would cease to exist.

**Explanation**

If qualities are distinct from substance, then they must either be dependent on substance or independent of it.

* **Dependent Qualities:** If qualities are dependent on substance, then there would be an infinite number of substances. For example, if knowledge is a quality that depends on a substance, then there would be an infinite number of substances, each with its own knowledge.
* **Independent Qualities:** If qualities are independent of substance, then substance would cease to exist. For example, if knowledge is a quality that is independent of substance, then there would be no need for a substance to support it.

Therefore, the idea that substance and qualities are distinct is flawed. The five-fold categories, beginning with the substance, are in reality a collection of qualities.

Page #154:
---------------------------
## English Translation:

**Verse 150**

If someone were to raise another objection, it would be this: If the infinite knowledge and other qualities, which reside in a pure soul-substance, were to become separate from that soul-substance, then similarly, in another pure soul-substance, the infinite qualities would also become separate. This would lead to the conclusion that the pure soul-substances would become infinite due to the separation of the infinite qualities from them. Just as the infinity of the substance is stated in the case of the substance of the Supreme Soul, which is capable of being grasped, due to the distinction between qualities and the qualified, similarly, it should be understood in the case of the impure soul-substance, which is capable of being abandoned, and the substance of karma, etc. That is, with the distinction between qualities and the qualified, each quality, whether primary or secondary, would have a primary or secondary substance as its basis, and thus the substance would become infinite. And when the qualities depart from the substance, the substance would cease to exist, whereas it has been stated that the aggregate of qualities is the substance. If a separation of the qualities from the substance, which is in the form of an aggregate of qualities, is accepted, then where would the substance, which is an aggregate of qualities, remain? It cannot remain in any way. || 44 ||

**Verse 45**

**Commentary:** This is a statement about the inherent non-duality of substance and qualities. The non-duality of substance and qualities is accepted as being in the form of their inseparable location, but their duality in the form of separate locations is not accepted. For example, just as a single atom is non-dual with its single atomic location due to their inseparability, similarly, the single atom and the qualities residing in it, such as touch, taste, smell, color, etc., are non-dual due to their inseparable location. Just as there is duality between two extremely distant objects, such as the Vindhya mountains, and duality between two extremely close objects, such as water and milk, which are mixed, due to their separate locations, so also, there is no duality between substance and qualities due to the absence of separate locations. || 45 ||

**Hindi Commentary:**

**Verse 45:**

**Meaning:** (द्रव्यगुणानाम्) The substance and qualities [अविभक्तम् अनन्यत्वम्] are non-dual in the form of their inseparability, (निश्चयज्ञा: हिं) those who know with certainty [तेषाम्] them [विभक्तम् अन्यत्वम] do not accept their duality in the form of separability [वा] or (तद्विपरीतं) (duality in the form of) inseparability (न इच्छन्ति).

**Explanation:** This is a statement about the inherent non-duality of substance and qualities. The non-duality of substance and qualities is accepted as being in the form of their inseparable location, but their duality in the form of separate locations is not accepted.

Page #155:
---------------------------
The concept of "vibhaktpradeshtva-svrupa" (being distinct in terms of space) as otherness and "vibhaktpradeshtva-svrupa" as non-otherness is not accepted. It is explained clearly as follows: Just as an atom, due to its indivisibility in terms of space, is non-other to its own space, similarly, an atom and the qualities residing in it, such as touch, taste, smell, and color, due to their indivisibility in terms of space, are non-other (avibhaktpradeshtva-svrupa). However, just as the distant mountains Sahya and Vindhya are other to each other due to their distinct spatial locations, and similarly, the mixed milk and water are non-other due to their close proximity, in the same way, substances and qualities are not other due to their non-distinct spatial locations (vibhaktpradeshtva-svrupa) and are not non-other due to their distinct spatial locations. ||45||

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

**Verse 45 of the Hindi Commentary**

This verse further explains that there is a certain inseparability, a unity, between substance and qualities.

**General Meaning with Anvaya:**

(Davyagunaanam) The unity and inseparability (avibhattam, anannatam) of substance and qualities (nichchayahu) are known to those who are certain. (Vibhattam anannatam) They do not desire their separation and difference (nichchati). (Va) Or (tersi) they do not accept (tabivaridam) their opposite nature, i.e., their difference from their own nature, as being certain (hi).

**Specific Meaning:**

Just as an atom is inseparable from its qualities like color, etc., meaning there is no difference in their respective regions, similarly, the pure soul substance is inseparable from its inherent qualities like pure knowledge, etc., and the impure soul is inseparable from its inherent qualities like perception and knowledge, etc., and the remaining substances are inseparable from their respective qualities. It is necessary to understand that there is no difference in the regions of substance and qualities. Those who are certain, like the Jain Acharyas, do not accept that there is a difference between the Himalayas and the Vindhya mountains, or that there is a difference in the regions of water and milk when they are in the same area. Even though they do not accept this difference between substance and qualities, they also do not accept that substance and qualities are completely inseparable from each other. In other words, just as there is inseparability in terms of regions between substance and qualities, they do not accept that there is inseparability in terms of designation, etc. In other words, they do not accept that substance and qualities are either completely inseparable or completely separate. They do not accept both unity and difference without any basis, but they accept both natures based on different bases. Unity in terms of regions leads to inseparability. The Acharyas believe that designation, etc., leads to difference between substance and qualities.

The implication here is that the person who experiences the taste of the nectar of supreme bliss, which is the unity and non-dualistic supreme joy that comes from the pure knowledge and perception of the self-essence, free from the objects and passions that are different from the pure knowledge and perception of the self-essence, is the one who is worthy of receiving that self. This self is one with countless pure regions, the size of the space of the universe, and its qualities of pure knowledge, etc.

**Verse 45**

In this way, the explanation of the inseparability and separability between quality and the qualified has been explained briefly in three verses. These verses are numbers 43, 44, and 45.

**Note:**

The dependence of designation, etc., on the difference between substance and qualities is rejected here.

Page #157:
---------------------------
There are many designations, forms, numbers, and objects. They exist both in the case of otherness and non-otherness of the substance-qualities. 
For example, the designation of the sixth case (षष्टीव्यपदेश) is in the otherness of "Devadatta's cow," similarly, it is in the non-otherness of "the branch of the tree," "the qualities of the substance." 
Similarly, the designation of the case (कारकव्यपदेश) is in the otherness of "Devadatta picks the fruit for Dhanadatta with a goad in the garden on the tree," similarly, it is in the non-otherness of "the clay makes itself into a pot by itself, for itself, from itself, in itself, the soul knows the soul by the soul, for the soul, from the soul, in the soul." 
Similarly, the form (संस्थान) is in the otherness of "tall Devadatta's tall cow," similarly, it is in the non-otherness of "the large branch-cluster of the large tree," "the concrete qualities of the concrete substance." 
Similarly, the number is in the otherness of "ten cows of one Devadatta," similarly, it is in the non-otherness of "ten branches of one tree," "infinite qualities of one substance." 
Similarly, the object (विषय) is in the otherness of "cows in the cowshed," similarly, it is in the non-otherness of "branches in the tree," "qualities in the substance." 
Therefore, designations, etc., do not establish the difference of substance-qualities as reality.

Page #158:
---------------------------
The description of the six substances and five categories is similar to how "branches are in a tree" and "qualities are in a substance" - they are both inherently present. Therefore, naming, form, number, and object do not prove a difference in substance and qualities. ॥46॥

Page #159:
---------------------------
**Pancastikaya Prabhrit**

155. The **Nayaayika** (logician) who holds the special view says, "If there is no distinction between substance and qualities in isolation, then designation etc. are not established." The answer to this is that even if there is distinction between substance and qualities in some respects and non-distinction in some respects, designation etc. can still occur. For example, the sixth case and the agent, object, instrument, recipient, separation, and location, these six cases are of two types. In one type of distinction, for example, "Devadatta's cow" is said, and in the other type of non-distinction, for example, "the branch of the tree," "the infinite knowledge etc. qualities of the soul." The case is explained as follows: "Devadatta, the man named, being the agent, breaks the fruit-like object with his goad-like instrument for Dhanadatta in the garden-like location from the tree." This is an example of the case in distinction, in which all six cases are different. Similarly, "the soul, being the agent, contemplates its own soul-like object with its own soul-like instrument for the sake of its own soul in its own soul-like location near its own soul-like base." This is an example of the six cases in non-distinction. In both these examples, the distinction and non-distinction of the case are explained. Now, the aspect of size is explained. "Devadatta is tall" is the same as "the house is large" in distinction, and "the long branch of the long tree is heavy" and "the concrete substance has concrete qualities" are the same in non-distinction.

Now, the aspect of number is explained. "Devadatta has ten villages" is the number in distinction, and similarly, "the tree has ten branches" or "the substance has infinite qualities" is the number in non-distinction. Here, in the verse, the meaning of the word "vishaya" (object) is "base," which is shown as follows: "There are cows in the "gostha" (cowshed)" is the object in distinction, and similarly, "there are qualities in the substance" is the object in non-distinction. In this way, designation etc. are established in both distinction and non-distinction, therefore, the distinction between substance and qualities in isolation is not established.

In this verse, the **Jivaastikaya** (soul) which is not definitely named as "man," "hell-being," etc., which are born from name-karma-udaya (the rise of karma related to name), and which is not definitely associated with the six bodies, such as the square, etc., is still, in terms of convention, according to the previous logic, associated with a body of a size slightly smaller than the final body, and which is infinite in number due to its infinite qualities, such as omniscience, etc., is still associated with an infinite number due to having an infinite number of pure regions according to the evidence of the world and space, and which is not the object of the five senses, which are the enjoyers of the pleasure of the objects of the five senses, is still, due to the feeling of the pure soul devoid of the objects of the five senses, the object of the contemplation of the one pleasure-form, which is free from attachment and eternally blissful, which contemplation is transforming into the feeling of supreme equality-rasa (taste) in all the regions of the soul, such a pure **Jivaastikaya** soul is the one that is to be grasped. This is the meaning. || 46 ||

## Chapter 156: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

**Verse 47:**

This is an example of the difference and non-difference of reality. Just as wealth and knowledge make a man wealthy and knowledgeable respectively, in two ways, so too do the wise say that there is both separateness and oneness.

**Commentary:**

Just as wealth, which is made up of different existences, different locations, different numbers, and different objects, makes a man wealthy, so too knowledge, which is made up of non-different existences, non-different locations, non-different numbers, and non-different objects, makes a man knowledgeable. This is how we should understand it in other cases as well. Where there is a difference in the substance, there is separateness. Where there is no difference in the substance, there is oneness.

Page #161:
---------------------------
##  Verse 47: An Example of Distinction and Non-Distinction with Certainty

Now, an example of distinction and non-distinction with certainty is explained:

Knowledge (**naan**) makes the knower (**naanin**) and wealth (**dhan**) makes the wealthy (**dhanin**). What does it do? It makes the wealthy (**dhanin**) and the knower (**naanin**) in two ways, through two kinds of reasoning, through two kinds of certainties in conduct. Just as, they say, "They speak, thus": What do they say? Separateness and oneness. Who says it? The knowers of truth.

Just as, wealth, having a separate existence, is distinct from the person having a separate existence, and has a different name, a different location, a different number, a different subject matter, and a different basis, so the wealthy is designated as such due to the separateness of the doer. Similarly, knowledge, having a non-separate existence, is non-distinct from the person having a non-separate existence, and has a non-distinct name, a non-distinct location, a non-distinct number, a non-distinct subject matter, and a non-distinct basis, so the knower is designated as such due to the non-separateness of the doer.

The explanation of the example has been given. Similarly, in the case of giving, where there is a designation based on the distinction of the desired object, there, with certainty, distinction should be known, as explained in the previous verses, like Devadatta's cow, etc. Where, however, there is a designation based on non-distinction, there, with certainty, non-distinction should be known, like the branches of a tree, the infinite knowledge of the soul, etc.

In this sutra, whatever is non-distinct in name, non-distinct in location, non-distinct in number, and non-distinct in subject matter, that soul makes the knower. Just as, due to ignorance, etc., the soul wanders in the states of human, hell, etc., so, whatever is the seed of the tree of liberation, whose power of contemplation overcomes all the fields of objects, time, and existence, that very thing bears the fruit of pure knowledge. This non-changing, self-aware knowledge should be contemplated by the knowers.

Page #162:
---------------------------
The description of the six substances and the five astikayas is inseparable from knowledge, the establishment of knowledge is inseparable from the knower, the establishment of the knower is inseparable from knowledge, the number of knowledge is inseparable from the knower, the number of the knower is inseparable from knowledge, the basis of knowledge is inseparable from the knower, the basis of the knower is inseparable from knowledge. In this way, there is a statement of inseparability or non-duality between knowledge and the knower. According to these two examples, one should consider the dartant view, where there are different substances, their names and so on should be known differently. For example, in the previous story, the example of Devadatta and the cow was given. Where the names and so on are said to be inseparable in the same substance, there one should know the inseparability with certainty. For example, the branches of a tree or the infinite knowledge etc. qualities of a living being etc. Here, in this sutra, the one who is inseparably described with the living being, has an inseparable establishment, inseparable number, inseparable basis, and who is called the knower of the living being, without whose benefit this living being has been wandering in the realms of hell, human beings, etc. since time immemorial, and who is truly the seed of the tree of liberation, and whose contemplation, as a result of which, without any order, all substances, fields, time, and emotions are known, the pure, perfect knowledge of all kinds arises, that is, the contemplation of that unchanging self-awareness knowledge is to be done by the knowers, this is the meaning. ||47||
Time Explanation Verse 48 The fault is in the fact that the qualities of the substance are different from each other.
The knower and knowledge are always different from each other. The right Jain view leads to the conclusion that both are non-sentient. ||48||
The knower and knowledge are always different from each other. The right Jain view leads to the conclusion that both are non-sentient. ||48|| If the knower is different from knowledge, then he would be non-sentient because he would be unable to perform actions without the help of knowledge, just like a lifeless axe cannot cut without a person holding it. Similarly, if knowledge is different from the knower, then it would be non-sentient because it would be unable to perform actions without the help of the knower, just like a lifeless axe cannot cut without a person holding it. And, knowledge and the knower cannot be considered sentient together because the substance is without any special characteristics, and the qualities are without any support, and are empty. ||48||
Hindi Time Explanation Verse 48 Anvayaarth - (Knower) If the knower [soul] [and] (knowledge) knowledge [always] always (of each other) mutually (different from each other) different from each other (different from each other) then {both. Both (non-sentient) non-sentient (arises) arises (right Jain view) such is the right Jain view.

---------------------------
##  Translation:

159. If the five *astikayas* (categories of existence) and their attributes are considered to be distinct entities, then the following flaws arise:

If the knower (soul) is distinct from knowledge, then the soul, like a Devadatta without an axe, will be unable to perform the action of knowledge due to the absence of its instrumental aspect, and thus will be unconscious. Similarly, if knowledge is distinct from the knower (soul), then knowledge, like an axe without Devadatta, will be unable to perform the action of its agent due to the absence of its agent aspect, and thus will be unconscious. Furthermore, it is not possible for consciousness to arise from the combination of knowledge and the knower (soul) as distinct entities, because non-specific substance and the void without support are devoid of attributes. In other words, substance without attributes and attributes without a substance-like support are impossible. ||48||

**Sanskrit Commentary Verse 48:**

This verse shows the flaw in considering knowledge and the knower (soul) as completely distinct. If the knower (soul) and knowledge are completely distinct, then what is the flaw? The flaw is that both knowledge and the knower (soul) will be unconscious (inert). How is this inertness? It is a complete rejection of the teachings of the Jinas. Just as heat, which is completely distinct from the fire, is capable of burning, but is certainly cold in the absence of fire, similarly, knowledge, which is completely distinct from the soul, is capable of understanding objects, but is certainly inert in the absence of the soul. Just as fire, which is completely distinct from the heat, is capable of burning, but is certainly cold in the absence of heat, similarly, the soul, which is completely distinct from knowledge, is capable of understanding objects, but is certainly inert in the absence of knowledge. Some may argue that just as Devadatta becomes a cutter with a separate axe, similarly, the knower (soul) becomes a knower with separate knowledge. This is not correct. The axe is an external instrument for cutting, while the special power of the man, which arises from the absence of obstacles to his effort, is the internal instrument. In the absence of this power, the axe, even with the hand, cannot cut. Similarly, in the absence of the internal instrument of knowledge, even with the external support of light, etc., the man cannot understand objects. Therefore, due to the absence of knowledge, the soul becomes inert and wanders in the world, unable to attain the ultimate happiness of eternal bliss, which is free from attachment and is the natural beauty of the pure soul. This knowledge of the pure soul, which is free from attachment and other defilements, is the one that should be attained. ||48||

**Hindi Commentary Verse 48:**

This verse shows the flaw in considering knowledge and the knower (soul) as completely distinct. If you consider knowledge to be completely separate from the knower (soul), then what is the flaw?

## Six Substances - Description of the Five Astikayas, Verse 3

**Meaning with Anvaya:** (The) Knower (soul) (and) his knowledge (are) (always) different from each other (if) they are different substances (then) both the soul and knowledge (will) become (inanimate) (this) is (well) the statement of the Jinas.

**Detailed Meaning:** Just as if fire, the possessor of the quality of heat, becomes completely different from its quality of heat, then the fire will certainly become cold, unable to perform the action of burning, similarly, if the living being, the possessor of the quality of knowledge, becomes different from its quality of knowledge, then it will become inert, unable to know the object. Just as fire is considered completely different from the quality of heat, then it becomes cold, unable to perform the action of burning, similarly, if the knowing living being is considered completely different from the quality of knowledge, then it becomes inert, unable to know the object. Then it will be like Devadatta is different from his chisel, which cuts the grass, similarly, the knower is different from knowledge, this cannot be said. The chisel is only an external instrument for the action of cutting, but the internal instrument is the special potency of the man, which arises from the destruction and cessation of the obstacles to potency. If there is no inner power, then even with the chisel in hand, the work of cutting cannot be done. Similarly, even with the external cooperative causes like light, gravity, etc., if there is no internal instrument of knowledge in the man, then he cannot perform the action of knowing the object. Here the implication is that the living being, who is inert due to the lack of knowledge, does not know the ultimate happiness, which is free from attachment, natural, beautiful, and full of joy, and is wandering in the world, should accept his pure self-experienced knowledge, which is free from attachment, etc.

**Verse 49:**

This is the refutation of the relationship of samvaya between knowledge and the knower.

For he is not different from knowledge due to samvaya, the knower is not different from knowledge.

And the statement that he is ignorant is a proof of oneness.

**Translation of Verse 49:**

It is not established that the man, who is different from knowledge, becomes a knower due to the samvaya of knowledge. He is not different from knowledge due to samvaya, the knower is not different from knowledge. And the statement that he is ignorant is a proof of oneness.

**Note:** The translation preserves the Jain terms like "samvaya" and "astikaya" as requested.

Page #165:
---------------------------
"Is the soul, prior to the union with knowledge, a knower or a non-knower? If it is a knower, then the union with knowledge is futile. If it is a non-knower, then is it a non-knower due to the union with non-knowledge, or due to being one with non-knowledge? It cannot be due to the union with non-knowledge, for the union of a non-knower with non-knowledge is futile, and knowingness does not exist in the absence of the union with knowledge. Therefore, the statement 'non-knower' necessarily establishes oneness with non-knowledge. And since oneness with non-knowledge is established, oneness with knowledge is also necessarily established."

##  Verse 162:

**Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**

**Verse 3:** Just as the sun's light exists even when covered by clouds, and becomes manifest as the clouds disperse, similarly, **Kevala Jnana** (perfect knowledge), which is the unhindered, all-encompassing knowledge of the three realms and all their contents, illuminating infinite Dharmas, exists in the Jiva (soul) from the beginning. However, due to the influence of **Karma** (actions), it remains obscured in the realm of **Vyavahara** (practical life). As the **Karma** veil dissipates, **Kevala Jnana** gradually becomes manifest. This knowledge is not something external to the Jiva, nor does it become connected to the Jiva through **Samavaya** (inherent connection) at a later stage. 

**Hindi Commentary Verse 49:**

If one considers **Jnana** (knowledge) to be completely separate from the **Jnani** (knower), then even **Samavaya** (inherent connection) cannot establish their unity.

**General Meaning with Anvaya (word order):**

**Jnana** (knowledge) is completely different from the **Jiva** (soul), and the **Jiva** is not connected to the **Jnani** (knower) through **Samavaya** (inherent connection). This statement makes the unity of **guna** (quality) and **gunin** (possessor of the quality) a possibility.

**Specific Meaning:**

Two questions arise: Before the **Samavaya** connection of **Jnana** with the **Jiva**, was the **Jiva** a **Jnani** (knower) or an **Ajnani** (non-knower)? If one says that the **Jiva** was a **Jnani**, then the **Samavaya** connection of **Jnana** becomes meaningless, as the **Jiva** was already a **Jnani**. If one says that the **Jiva** was an **Ajnani**, then two further questions arise: Was the **Jiva** an **Ajnani** due to the **Samavaya** connection of the **Ajnanaguna** (quality of ignorance) or due to its inherent nature? If the **Jiva** was an **Ajnani** due to the **Samavaya** connection of the **Ajnanaguna**, then the **Samavaya** connection becomes meaningless, as the **Jiva** was already an **Ajnani**. If one accepts that the **Jiva** was an **Ajnani** by nature, then why not accept that **Ajnanatva** (ignorance) is also inherent by nature? After all, **Jnana** is a **guna** (quality) of the **Atma** (soul), and **guna** and **gunin** are not separate.

The essence of this verse is that just as the sun's light exists even when covered by clouds, and becomes manifest as the clouds disperse, similarly, **Kevala Jnana** exists in the **Jiva** from the beginning. However, due to the influence of **Karma**, it remains obscured in the realm of **Vyavahara**. As the **Karma** veil dissipates, **Kevala Jnana** gradually becomes manifest. This knowledge is not something external to the **Jiva**, nor does it become connected to the **Jiva** through **Samavaya** at a later stage.

##  Translation:

**Verse 50**

This verse refutes the existence of any other entity (padartha) besides the samvaya.

**Explanation:**

* **Samvartattva** (co-existence) is the samvaya.
* **Apritagbhutatva** (non-separateness) is also the samvaya.
* **Ayutasiddhatva** (non-separate existence) is also the samvaya.

Therefore, it is stated that **Ayutasiddhi** (non-separate existence) is the characteristic of dravyas (substances) and gunas (qualities).

**Commentary:**

The co-existence of dravyas and gunas, being non-beginning and non-ending, is the samvartattva. This is the samvaya according to the Jains. Due to the non-separateness of dravyas and gunas, even though there are differences in names and other aspects, they are non-separate in reality. The absence of any other entity that is the cause of their existence is the ayutasiddhatva. Therefore, the dravyas and gunas, which have the characteristic of samvaya, are characterized by ayutasiddhi, not by apritagbhutatva.

**Hindi Explanation:**

This verse refutes the existence of any other entity (padartha) besides the samvaya.

* **Samvartattva** (co-existence) is the samvaya.
* **Apritagbhutatva** (non-separateness) is also the samvaya.
* **Ayutasiddhatva** (non-separate existence) is also the samvaya.

Therefore, it is stated that **Ayutasiddhi** (non-separate existence) is the characteristic of dravyas (substances) and gunas (qualities).

**Sanskrit Explanation:**

This verse refutes the existence of any other entity (padartha) besides the samvaya.

* **Samvartattva** (co-existence) is the samvaya.
* **Apritagbhutatva** (non-separateness) is also the samvaya.
* **Ayutasiddhatva** (non-separate existence) is also the samvaya.

Therefore, it is stated that **Ayutasiddhi** (non-separate existence) is the characteristic of dravyas (substances) and gunas (qualities).

Page #168:
---------------------------
## Chapter 164, Verse 3: Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

Here, in this explanation, it should be understood that the relationship of inherent oneness (tadātmya-sambandha) with the soul, beginning from the knowledge-quality, is established. Similarly, it should be believed and understood that the soul has an inherent oneness with the infinite qualities that are included in pure knowledge, such as the unhindered, unmeasurable, imperishable, natural, free from the defects of attachment, etc., and the ultimate bliss that is the sole nature of the soul. This should be constantly meditated upon by abandoning all the alternatives of attachment, etc. || 50 ||

Thus, two verses have been spoken, primarily refuting the concept of samvāya (co-existence).

Page #169:
---------------------------
This is a concluding section of the explanation of the five categories (Panchaastikaya) and their characteristics (guna) in the context of time (samaya). It uses the example of the four qualities (varna, rasa, gandha, sparsa) to explain the concept of non-duality (ananta) between substance (dravya) and its qualities.

**Verse 51:**

The four qualities (varna, rasa, gandha, sparsa) are formed from the atoms (paramanu) and are distinct from the substance (dravya) due to their specific characteristics. They are not separate from the substance in essence, but appear distinct due to their specific characteristics.

**Verse 52:**

Similarly, knowledge (jnana) and perception (darsana) are connected to the soul (jiva) and are not separate from the soul in essence. They appear distinct due to their specific characteristics, but in reality, they are always inseparable from the soul.

**Explanation:**

The four qualities (varna, rasa, gandha, sparsa) are formed from the atoms (paramanu) and are not separate from the substance (dravya) in essence. They appear distinct due to their specific characteristics, such as their name and description. Similarly, knowledge (jnana) and perception (darsana) are connected to the soul (jiva) and are not separate from the soul in essence. They appear distinct due to their specific characteristics, such as their name and description. However, in reality, they are always inseparable from the soul.

This section concludes the explanation of the qualities (guna) related to use (upayoga). The next section will discuss the qualities (guna) related to action (kartṛtva).

Page #170:

## 166
## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

Even though they are non-different due to being in the same location, they are made distinct by the specific characteristics that are the cause of their designation, such as name and so on. In this way, knowledge and perception, which are connected to the soul, are also non-different due to being in the same location as the soul substance, but they are made distinct by the specific characteristics that are the cause of their designation, such as name and so on. However, they inherently always remain non-distinct. ||51
52||

This concludes the explanation of the utility quality. Now, the explanation of the causative quality. Its introduction (preface) is done in the first three verses. 
[Sanskrit Commentary] Verses 51-52
Now, the conclusion of the explanation of the non-difference of substances and qualities is stated in the form of an example and illustration. The color, taste, smell, and touch are said to be in the form of atoms, which are the form of the atomic substance. By what are they made distinct? By specific characteristics - specific characteristics, such as name, definition, purpose, and other differences, or, as per the alternative reading, "specific characteristics are specific characteristics," specific characteristics are the qualities and characteristics of the substance, which are inherently clear. How are they like this? They are from the substance - from the atomic substance, they are non-different by definition. They become different by effort - they become distinct by designation, such as name and so on, according to the later practical approach. Thus, the verse of the example has passed. 
[Sanskrit Commentary] Perception and knowledge are also like this - perception and knowledge are two. How are they like this? They are two, being connected to the soul. Again, how are they like this? They are non-different in the form of location, being countless by definition. What do they do in this way? They make distinctness and diversity by designation, by difference in name and so on. It is clear that they are not inherently different by definition. 
[Sanskrit Commentary] In this section, even though the distinction between pure and impure was not made during the explanation of the eight types of knowledge and the four types of perception, it should be understood that the two types of knowledge and perception, which are the cause of the attainment of the ultimate happiness, which is characterized by freedom from anxiety, in the supreme soul, which is the ultimate bliss and the ultimate consciousness, free from beginning, middle, and end, are the objects of attainment. It should also be understood that they are the objects of meditation, by abandoning the knowledge that is mixed with anger, fear, and so on. ||51-52||

Thus, the two verses have passed in the form of an example and illustration.
[Sanskrit Commentary] Here, first, the five verses in the middle, in the form of the statement of perception and knowledge, in the order of the previously mentioned text, starting with "Uvaogo duviyappu," and then, the ten verses in the middle, in the form of the refutation of the difference between the quality and the qualified, against the Naiyayikas, in the order of the text starting with "Na vigrapyadi naanado," make a total of nineteen verses, which are the sixth section, "Upayogaadhikaara," in the nine sections of the explanation of the soul.
[Hindi Commentary] Verses 51-52
Uththānikā - Further, giving an example and illustration, the author says, while contracting the explanation of the non-difference between substance and qualities.
[Hindi Commentary] Anvaya-sahith saamaanyaarth - (Hindi) By definition (vaṇṇarasagandhapāsā) color, taste, smell, touch (paramaṇurūvidā) are said to be in the form of atoms (visesā) qualities (davvādō ya aṇpaṇā)

Page #171:
---------------------------
The five astikayas, beginning with pudgala dravya, are inseparable, yet they are distinct in terms of (anṇattapagāsagā) behavior, as they are the illuminators of the difference in terms of cognition, etc. (hoti) (taha) similarly, (jīvaṇibaddhāṇi) those related to the soul in terms of identity, (daṃsaṇṇāṇāṇi) perception and knowledge qualities (ṇṇṇabhūdāṇi) are inseparable from the soul, but (vavadesado) they are (puḍhattaṃ) mutually distinct in terms of cognition, etc. (kuvyanti). (hi) They are not distinct in terms of (sabhāvādo ṇ) nature.

**Special Meaning:** Just as the qualities of touch, etc., are inseparable from the pudgala atom, so too are the qualities of knowledge and perception inseparable from the soul. Just as the touch, taste, smell, and color of an atom are distinct, so too is the soul distinct from its qualities of knowledge and perception.

Here, the implication is that although the eight types of knowledge-use and four types of perception-use were not discussed in terms of purity and impurity, it should be understood that the supreme soul, which is free from beginning, middle, and end, and is full of supreme bliss and consciousness, is worthy of being grasped. The two uses, namely, perfect perception and perfect knowledge, are the causes of the happiness that is worthy of being grasped, which is the characteristic of the ultimate happiness that is free from all suffering. These two uses alone are worthy of being meditated upon, abandoning all the nets of choices, such as the sorrowful, the fierce, etc.

Thus, two verses were spoken in the form of an example and a statement. Here, first, five to nine verses were spoken, mentioning perception and knowledge in the order of the previous evidence text, "Uvaogo duviyapyō," etc. Then, ten verses were spoken in four different places, removing the distinction between the quality and the qualified, in the order of the text, "ṇ viyappadināṇādo," etc., for the sake of the logician. In this way, the sixth use chapter, in the form of the explanation of the soul chapter, was completed in the nine chapters, through the 18 verses in the form of a community.

**Verse 53:**

**Time Explanation:**

Jīvā aṇāi-ṇihaṇā saṃtā ṇatā ya jīva-bhāvādo.
Sabbhāvādo aṇantā pañcagg-guṇappadhānā ya.

Jīvā anādinidhanāḥ sāntā anantāśca jīvabhāvāt.
Sadbhavato'nantāḥ pañcāgraguṇapradhānāśca.

The souls are without beginning and end, they are finite and infinite, because of the nature of the soul. They are infinite in terms of their nature, and they are primarily characterized by the five sense organs and their qualities.

The souls are certainly the doers of their own nature, because they are not the doers of the nature of others. And those who do these things...

##  Verse 168:

**Description of the Sixfold and Fivefold**

Whether they are without beginning or end, whether they are finite, whether they are infinite, whether they are transformed into that form, whether they are not transformed, this is a matter of doubt.  

**Explanation:**

Since souls are without beginning or end by nature, due to their inherent characteristic of consciousness, they are finite in terms of their arising, diminishing, and quiescent states.  They are infinite in terms of their diminishing state.  It is not possible for the diminishing state to be finite due to its inherent nature.  

When the limiting conditions are removed, the soul's true nature, like the state of a liberated soul, is the state of being.  And due to this state of being, souls are considered to be infinite.  

It is not appropriate to say that there are other states of being for those who are without beginning or end, with the inherent characteristic of consciousness, that are finite or infinite.  They are indeed experienced as being dominated by the five primary qualities, because they are transformed into that form, like water contaminated with mud, due to the impurities of their karmic actions, which are without beginning.

##  Verse 161

**Translation:**

**Verse 53**

Following the previous eighteen verses, which described the relationship between the pure soul and the world in a general way, this verse now delves into the details of the three aspects of karma: **karm-kritrutva** (being the doer of karma), **bhoktṛutva** (being the experiencer of karma), and **samyuktatva** (being connected to karma). This is done through five different sections, starting with the phrase "**Jīva aṇāiṇihaṇā**" (Souls are without beginning and end).

**Explanation:**

First, the verse describes the nature and number of souls who will be discussed in relation to these three aspects of karma.

**Jīva aṇāiṇihaṇā** - Souls are without beginning and end. They are pure and eternal, existing in their true form, which is pure consciousness.

**Saṃtā-audayika-kṣāyopaśamika-aupamika-bhāvanāyā-apeksyā mādinidhanāḥ** - However, in relation to the states of **saṃtā** (existence), **audayika** (arising), **kṣāya** (decay), and **upaśamika** (subduing), they appear to have a beginning and end.

**Aṇantā ya-sādhanāntāḥ** - They are infinite in number, with no limit to their potential.

**Kasmat-sakaśāt?** - Why?

**Jīva-bhāvādo-jīva-abhāvataḥ kṣāyika-bhāvaḥ tasmāt** - Because the state of decay arises from the soul's own nature, not from something external.

**Na hi kṣāyika-bhāvasya sādittvād-antopi kila bhaviṣyatīty-āśaṅkanīyaṃ** - It is not possible for the state of decay to have an end, as it is an inherent part of the soul's nature.

**Sa hi karma-kṣaye sati kṣāyika-bhāvaḥ kevala-jñānādirūpeṇa samutpadyamānaḥ siddha-bhāva iva jīvasya sad-bhāva eva sa ca svabhāvasya vināśo nāsti ceti** - When karma is destroyed, the state of decay transforms into pure knowledge and other such qualities, becoming an inherent part of the soul's existence. Since the soul's true nature is eternal, the state of decay cannot be destroyed.

**Anādy-nidhana-sahaja-śuddha-pāriṇāmika-eka-bhāvānaṃ sādini-dhanāny-apy-audayikādibhavāntarāṇi kathaṃ sambhavantīti cet?** - If the soul is eternal and pure, how can states like **audayika** (arising) and others arise?

**Pañca-gga-guṇa-ppahaṇā ya- yadyapi svabhāvanā śuddha-astathāpi vyavahāreṇā-nādika-karma-bandha-vaśāt-sakardama-jalavada-audayikādibhavātra-pariṇatā dṛśyanta iti svārūpa-vyākhyānaṃ gataṃ** - Although the soul is inherently pure, due to the karmic bond, it appears to be impure and subject to the cycle of birth and death, like mud mixed with water. This is the explanation of the soul's nature.

**Idānīṃ saṃkhyāṃ kathayati sambhavado aṇantā-dravya-svabhāva-gaṇanayā punag-gnānāḥ** - Now, the verse explains the number of souls. They are infinite, based on the infinite nature of the soul.

**Sāntānānta-śabdāyor-dvitīya-vyākhyānaṃ kriyate-sahaṃtena saṃsāra-vināśena vartana sānnā bhanȳāḥ, na vitataḥ saṃsāra-vināśo yeṣāṃ te punar-anantā abhavyāsta ce abhavyā ananta-saṃkhyāṃ tebhyāpi bhavyā ananta-guṇa-saṃkhyāsta tebhyopya-bhavyā-samāna-bhavyā ananta-guṇā iti** - The words **sānta** (finite) and **anānta** (infinite) have a second meaning. Those who are **sānta** are those who will eventually end their cycle of birth and death. Those who are **anānta** are those who will never end their cycle of birth and death. There are an infinite number of **abhavyā** (those who will never attain liberation), and an infinite number of **bhavyā** (those who will attain liberation). And there are an infinite number of **abhavyā** who are equal to the **bhavyā** in number.

**Atra sūtre anādinidhanā anan-jñānādidhārāḥ śuddha-jīvā eva sādini-dhanamithyātvārāgādidosa-pariharā-pāṅgaṇānāṃ 'bhaya nāmu-pāda ya iti tātparyārthaḥ** - This verse emphasizes that the pure souls, who are without beginning and end, are the only ones who can truly overcome the false beliefs, attachments, and other negative qualities that lead to suffering. The phrase "**bhaya nāmu-pāda ya**" (those who have overcome fear) signifies this.

**End of Verse 53**

##  Verse 170: Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Categories

**Verse 3:**

With respect to (the category of) **Aṇaiṇihaṇā** (non-destruction), they are **anādi** (beginningless) and **ananta** (infinite). With respect to (the category of) **sānta** (finite), they are **sānta** (finite) and **ananta** (infinite). In this way, they are **pañcaggaguṇappadhānā** (possessors of five types of virtues) and **sattapākī** (possessors of two types of powers).

**Explanation:**

These living beings are pure **chaitanyarūpa** (consciousness) in nature, according to the **śuddha dravyārthika** (pure substance-based) **naya** (perspective), which perceives them as possessing pure **pāriṇāmika** (transformational) **paramabhāva** (ultimate state). Therefore, they are **anādi** (beginningless) and **ananta** (infinite), meaning that their **pāriṇāmika** (transformational) state always exists. With respect to the **audhayika** (active), **kṣayopśamika** (subduing), and **aupaśamika** (subdued) states, they are **sānta** (finite). These three states arise and cease due to the **udaya** (arising), **upaśama** (subduing), or **kṣayopśama** (subduing and destruction) of **karma** (karmic actions). With respect to the **kṣayika** (destroyed) states, they are **sānta** (finite) and **ananta** (infinite). The **kṣayika** (destroyed) states should not be considered **sādisānta** (finite and beginningless), because they arise from the destruction of **karma** (karmic actions) in the form of **kevala jñāna** (perfect knowledge) and other qualities, and they remain forever. These states are the natural states of a living being, similar to those of a **siddhājīva** (liberated soul), and nature is never destroyed. Although these living beings are pure by nature, due to their **karmabandha** (bondage to karma) from **anādikāla** (beginningless time), they are seen to transform into **audhayika** (active) and other states, like water mixed with mud. This is how their nature is explained.

Now, regarding the number, it is said that these living beings are **ananta** (infinite) in number, based on the **dravyasvabhāva** (nature of substance). This means that their number is **akṣaya ananta** (infinite and indestructible).

The word **sānta ananta** (finite and infinite) has another explanation: those living beings whose **samsāra** (cycle of birth and death) can end are **sānta** (finite), meaning they are **bhavyas** (those who can attain liberation). Those whose **samsāra** (cycle of birth and death) cannot end are **ananta** (infinite), meaning they are **abhavya** (those who cannot attain liberation). These **abhavya** (those who cannot attain liberation) living beings are **ananta** (infinite) in number. Among them, there are **anantaguṇe** (infinitely more) **bhavyas** (those who can attain liberation). Among these **bhavyas** (those who can attain liberation), there are **anantaguṇe** (infinitely more) **abhavya** (those who cannot attain liberation) who are similar to **bhavyas** (those who can attain liberation) and whose **samsāra** (cycle of birth and death) will never end.

The meaning of this verse is that those **bhavyas** (those who can attain liberation) who are **sādisānta** (finite and beginningless) and who transform by abandoning **mithyātva** (falsehood), **rāga** (attachment), and other **doṣas** (faults), are capable of being **guṇita** (transformed) by the **anādi ananta** (beginningless and infinite) **anantajñāna** (infinite knowledge) and other qualities of the pure living beings.

## Verse 54: Explanation of Time

**Verse 54:**

This is the resolution of the contradiction regarding the **sādisaniḍhanatva** (finite and beginningless) and **sādyaniḍhanatva** (finite and ending) of the living being's state.

**The Jinas have said:**

"The destruction of the **sat** (real) is the birth of the **asat** (unreal) for the living being."

This is a statement that is both **anyonyaviruḍdha** (contradictory) and **aviruḍdha** (non-contradictory).

**Explanation:**

The Jinas have said that the destruction of the **sat** (real) is the birth of the **asat** (unreal) for the living being. This statement appears contradictory because it seems to imply that the **sat** (real) can be destroyed and the **asat** (unreal) can be born. However, it is also non-contradictory because it is referring to the **pāriṇāmika** (transformational) states of the living being, which are constantly changing. The **sat** (real) state is the **pāriṇāmika** (transformational) state of the living being that is **anādi** (beginningless) and **ananta** (infinite). The **asat** (unreal) state is the **pāriṇāmika** (transformational) state of the living being that is **sānta** (finite) and **anādi** (beginningless). The destruction of the **sat** (real) state is the cessation of the **pāriṇāmika** (transformational) state that is **anādi** (beginningless) and **ananta** (infinite). The birth of the **asat** (unreal) state is the arising of the **pāriṇāmika** (transformational) state that is **sānta** (finite) and **anādi** (beginningless). Therefore, the statement is both **anyonyaviruḍdha** (contradictory) and **aviruḍdha** (non-contradictory) because it is referring to the **pāriṇāmika** (transformational) states of the living being, which are constantly changing.

##  Translation:

**Verse 54**

Thus, this living being, undergoing transformation through five states, sometimes experiences the destruction of its existence in the form of a human being, etc., due to the influence of a single, finite state. And sometimes, it experiences the creation of its existence in the form of a god, etc., due to the influence of another, infinite state. This seems to contradict the previously mentioned aphorism, "There is no destruction of the existent, nor creation of the non-existent." Because, according to the **dravyaarthika** (substance-based) interpretation, there is no destruction of the existent, nor creation of the non-existent. However, according to the **paryayarthika** (modification-based) interpretation, there is destruction of the existent and creation of the non-existent. This is not contradictory because, just as we see the impermanence of waves in the ever-present water, so too, the destruction and creation of existence are seen in the context of the ever-present living being.

**Verse 3 of the Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**

**Verse 54**

It is due to their mutual relativity. Here, although the living substance is said to be finite and infinite due to the theory of synonyms, yet the pure conviction is that only the substance which is eternal, infinite, marked by the single nature of the knower, free from change, and eternally blissful, is worthy of acceptance.

**Hindi Meaning**

**Verse 54**

The verse further states that although there is birth and death according to the theory of synonyms, there is no birth and death according to the theory of substance. There is no contradiction in saying this.

**General Meaning with Anvaya**

(Thus) as stated above, according to the theory of synonyms, (of the living being) there is birth of the non-existent synonym (of the living being) (because) the Jinas have said (so). This is contradictory, yet it is not contradictory.

**Specific Meaning**

As stated in the previous verse, according to the theory of the arising state, the human synonym, which is now existent, is destroyed due to the destruction of the lifespan, and due to the arising of the karma of motion, the non-existent synonym of the gods etc. is born. This is what the omniscient Lord has said. Earlier, in the introduction to the description of the substance, it was said that there is no destruction of the existent living substance in the form of being, and no birth of the non-existent living substance in the form of non-being. Here it is said that the existent living being is destroyed and the non-existent living being is produced. Therefore, there will be a contradiction. So the Acharya says that there is no contradiction because in the introduction to the substance, the destruction and production of the substance is denied according to the theory of substance. Here, it is said that production and destruction occur according to the theory of synonyms. There is no contradiction in this because the theory of substance and the theory of synonyms are mutually relative. Here, the intention is that although the living substance is said to be finite and infinite due to the theory of synonyms, yet the pure conviction is that only the substance which is eternal, infinite, marked by the single nature of the knower, free from change, and eternally blissful, is worthy of acceptance.

**Time Explanation**

**Verse 55**

This is the explanation of the condition, cause, and arising of the existence and non-existence of the living being.

**Neriya**

The names of the animals, humans, and gods are just designations. They are doing the existence and non-existence of the state of being.

Page #177:
---------------------------
The five astikayas, beginning with the naraka, are the 173 categories of beings, including the tiryancha, manushya, and deva, which are named and categorized. They cause the destruction of the sat (true) and the creation of the asat (false). Just as the ocean, being the ocean, does not experience the creation of the asat or the destruction of the sat, but the waves, carried and purified by the wind from the four directions, cause the creation of the asat and the destruction of the sat, so too, the jiva, being the jiva, does not experience the destruction of the sat or the creation of the asat, but the naraka, tiryancha, manushya, and deva categories, which arise in succession, cause the destruction of the sat and the creation of the asat.

Page #178:
---------------------------
Explanation of the Six Substances and the Five Astikāyas

The previous sutra had stated that the arising and passing away of the modes (paryāyas) of the jīva is due to the rise of the karmic name-determining (nāma) karma, such as that of the infernal beings (nāraka), animals (tiryañca), humans (manuṣya), and celestial beings (deva). 

The general meaning (anvayārtha) is: (Nāraka, tiryañca, manuṣya, devā iti) The natures (prakṛtis) of the karmic name-determining (nāma) karma are the infernal beings, animals, humans, and celestial beings. (Sato bhāvasya) They cause the (nāśaṃ) destruction of the existing mode and (asato uppādaṃ) the origination of the non-existent mode.

The specific meaning (viśeṣārtha) is: Just as the ocean is eternal in its substance, yet the waves in it are constantly arising and subsiding, similarly, this jīva is eternally the knower-seer by its intrinsic nature, yet due to the influx of karmic activities that have been flowing from beginningless time, it is moved away from the attainment of the pure, passionless self, and keeps taking birth in different gatis (modes of existence) by abandoning one and taking up another, due to the rise of karmic name-determining (nāma) karma. This is said with reference to the transformation of modes (paryāyas). In reality, similar or dissimilar modes are always present in the substance (dravya) eternally, as it has been said.

That is, the modes (paryāyas) of the eternal substance (dravya) keep manifesting and perishing at every moment, just as the waves keep rising and subsiding in the ocean. The purport here is that the pure, passionless, blissful consciousness alone is the true jīvāstikāya (the substance of the living being) worthy of being grasped.

Thus, the first part of the introductory explanation of the three aspects - agency (kartṛtva), etc. - has been completed in three verses.

Verse 56 - This is the description of the arising of the qualities of the jīva:
The jīva's qualities are associated with both (ubhayoḥ) the rise (udayena) and the subsidence (uvasamena) as well as the destruction (khayena) [of karmic matter]. They are manifold (bahūsu) and extensive (vitthinṇā) in various (atthesu) contexts.

Page #179:
---------------------------
The five **Jiva** qualities, beginning with **Audayika** (arising), are combined with **Upayashamika** (subsided), **Kshayopayashamika** (subsided and destroyed), **Kshayika** (destroyed), and **Parinaamika** (transformed). These qualities are manifested in many ways. 

The **Audayika** quality arises from the fruition of **karma**, the **Upayashamika** quality arises from the cessation of **karma**, the **Kshayopayashamika** quality arises from the destruction and cessation of **karma**, the **Kshayika** quality arises from the complete destruction of **karma**, and the **Parinaamika** quality arises from the transformation of the **Jiva**'s essence.

Four of these qualities are dependent on the four types of **upaadhi** (limiting conditions), while one is dependent on the **Jiva**'s inherent nature. These qualities are manifested in many ways due to the different types of **upaadhi** and the different natures of the **Jiva**.

Page #180:
---------------------------
Although the description of the six substances and five states of being is, in terms of its essence, the nature of the pure, knowing, and living being, it is still considered to be generated by karma due to its arising from the destruction of karma. It is a pure consequence, and it is completely independent of direct karma. Here, the explanation is that the mixed, pacifying, and destructive states are the causes of liberation. The arising state, along with delusion, is the cause of bondage. The pure consequence is neither the cause of bondage nor liberation. This is the meaning. Thus, it is said: "The mixed, pacifying, and destructive states, they bring about liberation. The arising state brings about bondage, the consequential state is inactive." ||56||

Thus, in the second inner space, one verse-sutra has been spoken, primarily about the five states of being.

Hindi Meaning Commentary Verse 56:

Uttanika - Further, in the introduction, the five states of being of the living being, which were mentioned earlier, are explained.

Meaning with Anvaya: (Those qualities of the living being) They are spread out in many forms (in the many truths) in the famous scriptures of the living being. (In the arising states) those arising from the arising, (in the pacifying states) those arising from the pacifying, (in the destructive states) those arising from the destruction of karma, (in the mixed states) those arising from the mixture of destruction and pacifying, and (in the consequential states) those arising from the consequential states.

Special Meaning: Here, the commentator has taken the reading "bahusu dasatyasu vitthina" and interpreted it as meaning that these five states have been elaborated upon in many scriptures. Of these five states, the arising, pacifying, and mixed states are dependent on karma. Although the destructive state is only in the form of knowledge, etc., and it is the nature of the pure, knowing, and living being by its very nature, it is still generated by the destruction of karma. Therefore, this state is also dependent on karma. The pure consequential state is independent of direct karma. Here, the meaning is that this explanation should be understood as follows: the mixed, pacifying, and destructive states are the causes of liberation, and the arising state, along with delusion, is the cause of bondage. The pure consequential state is neither the cause of bondage nor liberation. As it is said:

The three states, mixed, etc., bring about liberation, the arising state brings about bondage, and the consequential state is devoid of the action of bondage and liberation. ||56||

In this way, in the second inner space, one verse-sutra has been spoken, primarily about the five states of being.

Jain Terms Preserved:

Panchastikaya Prabhrita
Samaya Vyakhya Gatha 57 - This is a statement about the mode of agency (kartritva-prakarokti) of the Jiva's (soul's) origination-related (audayika-adi) states.

Kammam vedayamano jivo bhavam karedi yadrisam. So tassa tena katta havadi iti ya sasane pathitam. ||57||

The Jiva, while experiencing the karma, performs the state (bhava) of that nature. He becomes the doer (karta) of that state in that manner, as is stated in the scripture.

The Jiva experiences the karmic matter (dravya-karma) through the empirical point of view (vyavahara-naya). That which is being experienced is only the occasion (nimitta-matra) for the Jiva's states. On that occasion, which is merely the occasion, the state that is the Jiva's own karma is performed by the Jiva who has become the doer. Therefore, the Jiva is the doer of that state in the manner in which the state is performed by the Jiva in living.

## Translation:

178. 
Explaining the six substances and five astikayas, the karma-kanda, which is the action of mind, speech, and body, has resulted in the accumulation of knowledge-obscuring karma and other karmas in the past. The one who experiences this karma, which has arisen, through action, is the jiva. Who is the doer? The jiva is the doer. He performs the action of the jiva, the transformation of the jiva. He is the doer of that action. The jiva is the doer of the karma-tapatra, the result of the transformation of raga, etc., through the impure determination of the jiva, which is the cause of that action. This is the meaning of the statement in the scriptures, "The jiva is the doer." ||57||

The jiva is the doer and the experiencer, because he is not free from the perception of raga, etc., which is born of karma, and the perception of his own pure self. This is the main point of the explanation of the verse.

**Hindi Meaning:**

Verse 57: Now, the third point is being discussed. In the first verse of this section, it is said that the jiva is the doer of raga, etc. In the second verse, it is said that the arisen karma performs the action of raga, etc. Thus, there are two independent verses. Then, in the first verse, it is said that if the arisen karma is the only doer of raga, etc., then the jiva would become completely inactive. The second verse refutes this objection. Thus, the verses are mainly about the previous objection and its solution. Then, in the first verse, the statement of the scriptures is shown that the jiva is not the doer of the pudgala karma. In the second verse, the relationship between the jiva and karma is explained, and the six karakas are established. Thus, there are two independent verses in the third section. In this way, there are six verses in the third section, which mainly focus on the doership.

**Anvaya:**

(Karma) Karma, (vedayamanah) experiencing, (jivah) this jiva, (jarisayam) in the way, (bhavam) the state, (karedi) performs, (sah) that jiva, (tena) because of that, (tassah) of that state, (kartah) the doer, (havaditti yah) is, (sasane) in the Jain scriptures, (padhidam) is explained!

**Special Meaning:**

The soul, which is free from attachment and full of supreme bliss, and which delights in the vast and unbroken knowledge-kanda, does not experience its own nature. Instead, it engages in the action of mind, speech, and body, which is the karma-kanda. As a result, the jiva has accumulated knowledge-obscuring karma and other karmas in the past. When these karmas arise, the jiva experiences them and performs actions like raga, etc. Because of this impure determination, the jiva becomes the doer of that impure state. This is stated in the scriptures. ||57||

**Verse 58**

**Original Text:**

कम्मेण विणा उदयं जीवस्स ण विज्जदे उवसमं वा । खइयं खओव-समियं तम्हा भावं तु कम्म-कदं ।। ५८।।
कर्मणा विनोदयो जीवस्य न विद्यते उपशमो वा।
क्षायिकः क्षायोपशमिकस्तस्माद्भावस्तु कर्मकृतः ।।५८।।

**English Translation:**

Without karma, there is no rise (udaya) for the soul, nor is there any cessation (upasama).  Neither is there any decay (kshaya) or cessation of decay (kshayopasama). Therefore, the four states of the soul (kshayika, kshayopashamika, audayika, and aupashamika) are all created by karma.

**Commentary:**

This verse explains that karma is the sole cause of the four states of the soul: rise, cessation, decay, and cessation of decay.  The verse states that without karma, these states would not exist. Therefore, the soul's existence in these states is attributed to karma.

**Further Explanation:**

The commentary explains that the soul's inherent nature (parinama) is eternal and unchanging. However, the soul's temporary states (kshayika, kshayopashamika, audayika, and aupashamika) are caused by karma. These states are temporary because they arise and cease due to the influence of karma.

**Conclusion:**

This verse emphasizes the crucial role of karma in shaping the soul's existence and its temporary states. It highlights that the soul's true nature is eternal and unchanging, but its experiences are influenced by karma.

## Chapter 180: Description of the Five Astikayas of the Shadva-vyaya

This description of the five Astikayas of the Shadva-vyaya is natural. The Kshayika state, although it is inherent (manifest) in nature, is said to be Karma-krita because it is finite and arises due to the destruction of Karma. The Aupashmika state is also Karma-krita because it arises due to the subsidence of Karma and is destroyed by its non-subsidence.

Alternatively, the four states of Udya, Upashma, Kshaya, and Kshayo-pashma are the states of Dravya-karma. They are not the states of a Jiva with a single state. Therefore, Dravya-karma, which is the state of the soul arising from the Udyaika, is only instrumental in the burden of the soul. Because it is itself transformed, Dravya-karma also acquires the agency of the soul's states in the practical sense. ||58||

**Pancastikaya Prabhrut**
181
[Khaovsamyam] Kshayopaśamik bhava [na vijjhade] does not occur [tamha] because [bhavam tu kampakadham] all these bhavas are karma-krit.

**Special Meaning:**  Pure knowledge, darshan, lakshanadhari, and bhavakarma, dravyakarma, and nokarma are distinct from the supreme soul.  The audayik bhavas, which are obtained in the form of dravyakarma, cannot occur in the jiva without the parinam of raga, etc.  Not only audayik, but also aupashamik bhava cannot occur without the upasham of dravyakarma.  Similarly, kshayopaśamik bhava cannot occur without the kshayopaśam of dravyakarma, and kshayik bhava cannot occur without the kshaya of dravyakarma.  Therefore, all these bhavas are karma-krit.  Because, excluding pure parinamik bhavas, as mentioned earlier, the four bhavas - audayik, aupashamik, kshayopaśamik, and kshayik - cannot occur without dravyakarma.  Therefore, it is known that these four bhavas, audayik, etc., are karma-krit due to the unrefined, asadbhuta vyavahar nay.

Here, the implication is that in this sutra, the kshayik bhava, which is the form of the attainment of the new, kshayik, like kevalgyan, etc., and especially the nir-akulata lakshan, nischya sukha, which is inherent in kevalgyan, is the basis of infinite qualities.  This is the **1. kshayik bhava**, which is worthy of being grasped in all ways.  One should believe and know this through the mind, and by abandoning mithyatva and raga, etc., vikalpa-jnal, one should continuously meditate on this kshayik bhava.

In this way, the main point of this explanation is that these four bhavas are karma-krit due to the unrefined, asadbhuta vyavahar nay.  In the previous gatha, it was said that the jiva is the doer of raga, etc., bhavas due to the asuddha nischya nay.  Here, it is explained that karma is the doer of these bhavas due to vyavahar.  In this way, two independent gathas have been spoken.

**Samaya Vyakhya Gatha 59**
Jiva-bhavasya karma-kartṛtve pūrvapakṣo'yam.
Bhavō jadi kamma-kado attā kammas sa hodi kidha kattā.
Na kuṇadi attā kiñci vi muttā aṇṇam saga bhavam. || 59 ||
Bhavō yadi karma-kṛta ātmā karmaṇo bhavati katham kartā.
Na karotyātmā kiñcidapi muktvānyat svakam bhavam. || 59 ||

If, indeed, the jiva's bhava, in the form of audayik, etc., is done by karma, then the jiva is not the doer of it.

It is said that the six substances and five astikayas are described. It is not desirable that the jiva (living being) be considered inactive. Therefore, by the process of elimination, the jiva becomes the doer of dravyakarma (action of the substance). But how is this possible? Because, with certainty, the soul, abandoning its own nature, does not do anything else.

**Commentary:**

This is a preliminary objection (doubt) regarding the jiva being the doer of its own nature. If the jiva's nature, like being born, is created by karma, then the jiva is not the doer of its own nature. This is proven, and the inactivity of the jiva is not acceptable. Therefore, the remaining possibility is that the jiva must be the doer of dravyakarma. But how is this possible? Because, with certainty, the soul, abandoning its own nature, does not do anything else.

**Translation of the Sanskrit Commentary:**

The commentary then presents two interpretations of the verse. The first interpretation states that the verse presents a preliminary objection, arguing that if the jiva is not the doer of karma, then it would lead to the undesirable consequence of the jiva being inactive. The second interpretation argues that the verse actually presents a refutation of the preliminary objection, stating that the jiva is indeed the doer of karma, and that this is not a flaw but rather a necessary consequence of the jiva's nature.

The commentary then goes on to discuss the implications of the jiva being the doer of karma, and how this relates to the concept of liberation. It concludes by stating that the verse is a complex one, with multiple layers of meaning.

**Verse 60**

**General Meaning:** (If) if (भावो) the state of mind (कम्मकदो) is caused by karma, then (किध) how (अत्ता) the soul (कम्मस्य कत्ता होदि) becomes the doer of karma? Because, if we take the state of mind as solely caused by karma, then the soul cannot become the doer of karma without the state of mind, because (अत्ता) this soul (सगं भावं) leaves its own state of mind (मुक्ता) and (अण्णं किंचि वि) does not do anything else, like karma, etc.

**Specific Meaning:** If the soul is considered to be completely free from the state of mind, then there is a refutation of this in the next verse. This is one interpretation. Another interpretation is that the refutation is in this verse itself, and the solution is in the next verse, which only states the limitations of the object. How is this said? If, as stated earlier, karma is the doer of the state of mind, then the soul cannot be the doer of karma like punya, papa, etc. In response to this objection, the disciple, following the Sankhya philosophy, says that our view is that this soul is not the doer of karma, it is without qualities, pure, eternal, omnipresent, inactive, formless, conscious, and only the experiencer. This is the view of Kapila. According to our view, the soul being the non-doer of karma is an ornament, not a defect. This is refuted by saying that just as the soul is not the doer of the state of mind with pure conviction, if this soul is also not the doer with impure conviction, then there will be no bondage of its substance. Without the bondage of karma, there will be no world, then it will be completely liberated, but this is contrary to direct experience. This is the meaning.

**Explanation of the Verse:**

This verse states that the state of mind is caused by karma, and karma is also caused by the state of mind. However, the soul is not the doer of either karma or the state of mind. They are not created by each other. The soul is the doer of its own transformations, and karma is the doer of its own transformations.

**Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**

**Hindi Commentary Verse 60 Anvayaartha (Meaning; Karma is the cause of the state of being)**

The state of being is caused by karma (again) and (karma is the cause of the state of being) the state of being is the cause of karma, (but they are not the doers of each other) but in reality, they are not the doers of each other, (nor are they without a doer) but they are not without a doer either.

**Commentary:** This, in the previous sutra (verse 59), is the principle that resolves the previous objection.

Due to the fact that they are only causes, karma is the doer of the state of being (the doer of the state of being like the state of being of the audayika, etc. is the karma of the substance), the state of being is also the doer of karma, but in reality, neither karma is the doer of the state of being nor is the state of being the doer of karma. They (the state of being and the karma of the substance) are not without a doer either, because in reality, the jiva is the doer of the jiva's transformations and karma (pudgala) is the doer of the karma's transformations. ||60||

... **Sanskrit Meaning Commentary Verse 60**

Now, in the previous sutra, the previous objection was raised, saying that the self is not the doer of karma. This verse gives a refutation of that objection. In the second explanation, it shows the established view. The state of being is the pure jiva astikaya, which is the opposite of the state of being, which is the result of false attachment, etc. What is it characterized by? Karma is the cause - the karma that arises from the pure self-nature, which is characterized by the mere wonder of consciousness, without the rise of karma, is the cause of that which is the opposite of it. What is karma? Karma is the karma of the substance, which is different from the pure self-essence, without the karma of knowledge-obstruction, etc. Again, what is it like? The state of being is the cause - the state of being that is the opposite of the pure self-realization, which is without transformation, is the cause of that which is the cause of the state of being. Not - not again, of them - of the two, the state of being of attachment, etc. in the jiva and the karma of the substance. What is not? The doer - the mutual dependence of the doer, clearly, not without - not without. They are born - they are born, but again, the substance and karma are. Without whom? Without the doer, the dependent doer, but the state of being of attachment, etc. in the jiva is the dependent doer of the jiva, and the karma of the substance is the karma of the pudgala, which is not fit for the category of karma. In the second explanation, although the jiva is not the doer in the pure sense, but when considered in the impure sense, it is the doer, this is the meaning. ||60||

Thus, in the previous verse, in the first explanation, there was the previous objection and then the answer to it, so those two verses have passed.

**Hindi Meaning Commentary Verse 60 Utyanika:**

Further, in the previous sutra, the previous objection was raised, saying that the self is not the doer of karma. This verse refutes that objection. From the second explanation, it shows the limits of the object.

**Anvaya with General Meaning:** (The state of being) the state of being of attachment, etc. (karma is the cause) is caused by karma.

**Pancastikaya Prabhrut**
185
It is said (Pune) and (Bhavacaranam) due to the emotions like anger etc. (Kampam) the bondage of dravya karma (Havdi) happens (Tesim) of those dravya and bhavacarmas (Khalu) with certainty (Katta Na Du) there is no mutual upadan karta-pana (Du) but (Kattaram Vina) without the upadan karta (Pan Bhuda) they have not happened.
**Special Meaning:**
The pure, conscious, luminous, inherent nature of the pure jiva-stikaya, the opposite emotions, which are mithyatva and raga etc. are the results, are free from the rise of karmas, the mere wonder of consciousness, which is the nature of the Paramatma, is opposite to the karmas that are obtained in the rise, and are the cause of them, and the pure atma-tattva, which is free from the karmas like jnana-avaran etc., is different from the new dravya-karma, which is bound by the emotions like raga etc., which are opposite to the experience of the pure, unchanging soul. Even though this is the case, there is no mutual upadan karta-pana of the emotions like raga etc. related to the jiva and the dravya-karmas, but both the emotions like raga etc. and the dravya-karmas have not happened without the upadan karana, but the upadan karta of the emotions like raga etc. related to the jiva is the jiva itself, and the upadan karta of the dravya-karmas is the pudgala, which is worthy of karma-varna. In another explanation, the meaning is that although the jiva is not the karta of the emotions like raga etc. when considered with pure certainty, it is proven that the jiva is the karta of the emotions like raga etc. with impure certainty. 160 ||
In this way, the previous verse had presented the previous side through the first explanation, here the answer to it is given, in this way two verses are said.
**Samaya Vyakhya Gatha 61**
**Kuvan Sagam Sahavam Atta Katta Sagass Bhavasa.**
**Na Hi Poggal-Kammanam Idi Jinavayanam Munayavvam.** || 61 ||
**Kurvan Swakam Swabhavam Atma Katta Swakasy Bhavasya.**
**Na Hi Puhalakarmnanamiti Jinavachanam Jnatavyam.** || 61 ||

**Hindi Samaya Vyakhya Gatha 61**
**Anvayarth:** (Swakam Swabhavam) the result of one's own nature (Kurvan) doing, the atma (Hi) truly (Swakasy Bhavasya) of one's own emotion (Katta) is the karta, (Na Pugalakarmnanam) not of the pudgala-karmas, (Iti) such (Jinavachanam) the words of the Jina (Jnatavyam) to know.

##  Verse 61: Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

Here, the Agama shows that the soul is the doer of its own emotions, and the pudgala karma is not the doer.

**Sanskrit Commentary:**

Verse 61 further strengthens this explanation with the Agama's statement: "The soul, being the doer, does its own nature, which is the form of consciousness." Although pure emotions like omniscience are considered the soul's nature in pure knowledge, in the context of karma being the doer, impure emotions like attachment are also considered the soul's nature. The soul is the doer of its own emotions. However, the pudgala karma is not the doer, according to the Jina's words. This is what should be understood.

Although the doership of impure emotions is established here, they are to be abandoned, and the opposite, pure emotions like infinite bliss, are to be adopted. This is the meaning.

**Hindi Commentary:**

Verse 61: The explanation is further strengthened by the Agama's statement.

Meaning with Anvaya: The soul, being the doer of its own nature, is the doer of its own emotions. The pudgala karma is not the doer. This is the Jina's word, which should be understood.

Special Meaning: Although pure emotions like omniscience are considered the soul's nature in pure knowledge, in the context of karma being the doer, impure emotions like attachment are also considered the soul's nature. The soul is the doer of these impure emotions in the context of impure knowledge. However, the soul cannot be considered the doer of the pudgala karma. This is the Agama of the Jina. The implication here is that although the soul is established as the doer of impure emotions, these impure emotions are to be abandoned, and the opposite, pure emotions like infinite bliss, are to be adopted.

This is how the verse is explained through the Agama's statement.

## 187
**Panchaastikaya Prabhrit**
**Samaya Vyakhya 62**

Here, due to the inseparability of the factors, the self-nature of the karma and the jiva as the doer is stated. Karma also does its own by its own nature, and the jiva also does so by the nature of karma. ||62||

Karma also does its own by its own nature, and the jiva also does so by the nature of karma. ||6||

Karma, indeed, by being in the form of a pudgala-skandha, which is active in the form of karma, assumes the role of the doer. It considers itself as karma by the power of attaining karma, which is in the form of the instrument. Even after the destruction of the previous state, it attains the role of the object due to its dependence on the permanent. It attains the role of the recipient due to being embraced by the karma, which is in the form of the arising result. It attains the role of the locus due to being the basis of the result being held. It stands on its own as a six-factor entity and does not depend on any other factor.

Similarly, the jiva, by being active in the form of the soul-substance, which is in the form of a state, assumes the role of the doer. It considers itself as the instrument by the power of attaining the state, which is in the form of the instrument. It considers itself as karma by the state attained, which is in the form of karma. Even after the destruction of the previous state, it attains the role of the object due to its dependence on the permanent. It attains the role of the recipient due to being embraced by the karma, which is in the form of the arising state. It attains the role of the locus due to being the basis of the state being held. It stands on its own as a six-factor entity and does not depend on any other factor.

Therefore, there is no jiva as the doer of karma, and there is no karma as the doer of the jiva, due to the certainty of the factors. ||62||

**Hindi Samaya Vyakhya Gatha 62**

Anvayaarth - (Karma api) Karma also (sven svabhaavena) by its own nature (svakam karoti) does its own (cha) and (taadrushak jiva api) such a jiva also (karmasvabhaavena bhaavana) by the nature of karma (audyaikad adi bhaavase) (smayak aatmaanam) does its own as it truly is.

_Teeka_ - Due to the inseparability of the factors, karma and jiva are the doers of their own nature.

Karma, in reality, (1) assumes the role of the doer by being in the form of a pudgala-skandha, which is active in the form of karma. (2) It considers itself as karma by the power of attaining karma, which is in the form of the instrument. (3) It experiences karma by the karma-result attained, which is in the form of karma. (4) Even after the destruction of the previous state, it attains the role of the object due to its dependence on the permanent. (5) It attains the role of the recipient due to being embraced by the karma, which is in the form of the arising result (i.e., the arising result-work is given to it). (6) It attains the role of the locus due to being the basis of the result being held.

Page #192:
---------------------------
188
The six-fold category of substance, which has taken on the role of the locus, does not depend on any other factor, but exists in its own right as a six-fold category.
In the same way, the soul, (1) by virtue of its inherent nature as the soul-substance, takes on the role of the agent, (2) by virtue of its power to acquire qualities, takes on the role of the instrument, (3) by virtue of the qualities it acquires, experiences the role of the object, (4) by virtue of its steadfastness even when its previous qualities are destroyed, takes on the role of the separation, (5) by virtue of being the recipient of the qualities that arise (i.e., by virtue of the qualities that arise being given to it), takes on the role of the beneficiary, and (6) by virtue of being the basis of the qualities it possesses, takes on the role of the location - it exists in its own right as a six-fold category, without depending on any other factor. Therefore, it is certain that the soul is not the agent of the karma, and the karma is not the agent of the soul. ||62||

Page #193:
---------------------------
## Pancastikaya Prabhrut

**General Meaning with Anvaya:** (Karma) Karma also (with its own nature) (itself) its own material karma (well) does (in the same way) this Jiva also (with the nature of karma) does its own emotions in the form of karma.

**Specific Meaning:** The commentator explains by applying the six karakas of agent, action, etc., that this karmic pudgala, being the agent, obtains the karaka of the agent, and with the help of its own material karma, which is the instrument, it does its own karma pudgala for the state of the karma pudgala, from the karma pudgalas, in the basis of the karma pudgala itself. In this way, this pudgala, by undergoing transformation through its own inseparable six karakas, changes its state. It does not need the karaka of another substance. In the same way, the Jiva, being the agent itself, obtains its own emotional state, and with its own soul as the cause, it does its own soul for its own soul, from its own soul, in the basis of its own soul. That is, the soul, by undergoing transformation through its own inseparable six karakas, does its own emotions. It does not need any other karaka. Here, the implication is that just as the soul, undergoing transformation through the six impure karakas, does its own impure emotional state, so this pure soul, through the inseparable six karakas of its own right faith, its own right knowledge, and its own right conduct, undergoes transformation and does its own pure emotional state. || 6 ||

In this way, two verses are complete, independent of each other, according to the statement of the Agamas and the inseparable six karakas. In this way, the third inner space is complete through six verses from the community.

**Time Explanation Verse 63:** Karma does karma, if that soul does itself. How does it enjoy its fruit? The soul gives the fruit of karma. || 63 ||

Karma karma karoti yadi sa atma karoty atmanam.
Katham tasya phalam bhunakti atma karma ca dadati phalam. || 63 || Karmajīvayoranyonyākartṛtvē'nyadattaphalānyopabhogalakṣaṇadūṣaṇapuraḥsaraḥ pūrvapakṣo'yam. || 63 ||

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

**Hindi Commentary Verse 63**

**Anvayaartha** - (If) if (karma) karma (karma karoti) does karma and (sa: atma) the soul (atmanam karoti) does to the soul then (karma) karma (phalm katham dadati) why does it give fruit to the soul (na! and (atma! aga. tasya palam bhutate) why will it enjoy its fruit?

**Tika** - If karma and the jiva are mutually non-doers, then there will be a situation of "the fruit given by another is enjoyed by another", this defect is pointed out here and the previous side is presented. ||63||

**Sanskrit Tatparya Vritti Verse 63**

Now, after explaining the six karakas in the manner of the previous side, this explanation is done with certainty. Not knowing the Nayavichar, the student takes the one-sided view and presents the previous side: "If karma, karma, the doer, does karma, if, in one way, the soul does karma without dependence on the soul's transformation, if that soul does to itself, and not to the substance karma, then how will it enjoy the fruit of that undone karma? Who is it? The soul is the doer, and karma gives the fruit. How can the soul give the fruit to itself, which is not done by the jiva? It is not possible." ||63||

The verse is concluded with the previous side through the fourth position.

**Hindi Tatparya Vritti Verse 63**

**Uththānika** - Further, while explaining the six karakas in the manner mentioned earlier, this explanation is done with certainty. Hearing this, the student, not knowing the Nayavichar, takes the one-sided view and presents the previous side.

**Anvaya with General Meaning** - (Jadi) If (karma) substance karma (karma) substance karma does (kuvdi) in one way without dependence on the soul's transformation and (so appa) that soul (appaanm) does to itself - does not do substance karma, then (kidh) how (appa) the soul (tass phalm) enjoys the fruit of that undone karma (cha) and (karma) that undone karma by the jiva (phalm cha dedi) how does it give fruit to the soul.

**Samaya Vyakhya Verse 64**

**Atha Siddhanta Sutraani**

**Ogaadh-gaadh-nicido poggal-kayeihi savvado logo. Suhamehi badarehi ya namta-namteihi vividheihi.** ||64||

**Translation:**

**Ogaadh-gaadh-nicido poggal-kayeihi savvado logo. Suhamehi badarehi ya namta-namteihi vividheihi.** ||64||

**Meaning:** All beings are bound by the **Ogaadh-gaadh-nicido poggal-kayeihi** (the five astikayas: **Ogaadh**, **Gaadh**, **Nicido**, **Poggal**, and **Kayeihi**). They are also bound by various **Suhamehi badarehi ya namta-namteihi** (pleasures, pains, and the states of being limited and unlimited).

The entire world is filled with subtle and gross **puḍgala** particles, densely packed together.

## Explanation of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

This section primarily focuses on the "Ogaḍhagaḍha" and other verses, which explain the concepts of "Upādāna-Kartāpana" (the agent of creation) and "Bhoktāpana" (the experiencer). There are three verses in this section. Then, there are two verses that explain "Kāpana" (the creator) and "Bhoktāpana" (the experiencer) in a concise manner, starting with the verse "Jīva Poggalakāya". Following these, there are two verses, starting with "Evam Kattā Bhottā", which explain "Bandhaka-Svāmīpana" (the owner of bondage) and "Mokṣa-Svāmīpana" (the owner of liberation). In total, there are seven verses in this section, which address the opposing arguments before presenting the main point.

The first verse states that just as this world is filled with subtle beings (who are pure and possess infinite qualities like omniscience), it is also filled with Pudgalas.

**General Meaning with Anvaya:** (Loko) This world (Sambado) is completely filled (Suhamehi) with subtle (Vādarhiṁ Ya) and gross (Vivihehi) diverse (Tāṇatehiṁ) infinite (Poggalakāyehiṁ) Pudgala skandhas (Ogaḍha Gaḍha Ničito).

**Specific Meaning:** Just as this world is filled with five types of subtle stationary beings like the Earth-body, without any gaps, like a container filled with ink, similarly, this world is filled with countless, diverse, infinite Pudgala skandhas in all its countless regions. The Pudgala skandhas that are worthy of being categorized in this section are also present where the soul is. They are present there without being brought from elsewhere. Further categorizations will be discussed later in the section on bondage. The implication here is that although these categories are densely packed like water where the soul is, they are still worthy of being abandoned. The pure, single-natured, supreme soul, distinct from them, is the only one worthy of being embraced.

**Verse 64**

**Verse 65:** This verse explains the types of karma that arise from the actions of the soul.

**Anvaya:** Attā Kuṇadi Sabhāvam Taththa Gadā Poggalā Sabhāvehi. Gacchaṁti Kammabhāvam Aṇṇoṇṇāva-Gāha-Mavagāḍhā.

**Translation:** The soul creates its own nature, and the Pudgalas, with their own natures, enter into that nature. They become karma-nature, deeply intertwined with each other.

**Explanation:** The soul, in its state of samsara, never abandons its inherent nature of Pariṇāmic Chaitanya (transformative consciousness). Due to its eternal bondage to the Gandha (odor), it is eternally bound by the defilements of Moha (delusion), Raga (attachment), and Dvesha (aversion). It is through these defilements that the soul experiences various states of being. Whenever the soul experiences a state of delusion, attachment, or aversion, it creates a cause for karma. The Pudgalas, with their own natures, enter into the soul's region, intermingling with each other, and become karma-nature.

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

The Pañcāstikāya Prābhṛta
Hindi Commentary Gāthā 65

Anvayārtha - The ātmā (soul) performs (karoti) its own (svabhāva) nature (mōharaigadvēṣarūpa) in the form of delusion, attachment and aversion. Then, the pudgalas (matter aggregates) residing there (tatra gatāḥ), through their own (svabhāvaiḥ) nature, enter (viśiṣṭa prakārēṇa) the ātmā in a distinct manner, and attain (gacchanti) the bhāva of karma.

Ṭīkā - This verse describes how karma arises without being caused by others. The ātmā in the saṃsāra state, without abandoning its essential nature of cognitive consciousness, is bound by beginningless bondage and is permeated by the impure dispositions of beginningless delusion, attachment and aversion. Wherever and whenever the ātmā in the saṃsāra state performs (parinṇamati) its own dispositions in the form of delusion, attachment or aversion, there and at that time, the pudgalas, taking those dispositions as the instrumental cause, enter the ātmā's regions in a distinct manner through their own dispositions and attain the bhāva of karma.

Sanskrit Tātparyavṛtti Gāthā 65
When the ātmā has the impure dispositions of mithyātva (false belief), rāga (attachment) etc., the pudgala aggregates suitable for karma, certainly through their own upādāna (internal cause), transform into the form of karma.

Page #198:
---------------------------
The six substances, with their five categories, are described as being deeply and intensely (avagaḍhā) bound to karma (kammabhāvam). They become (gacchanti) the state of karma (dravya karma).

**Special Note:** The pure, unstained, luminous consciousness, free from attachment, aversion, and delusion, is called the natural state of the soul (ātmaka). Why is the state of attachment, aversion, etc. called the natural state? Answer: Due to the influence of the bondage (bandhaprakaraṇa), the state of attachment, aversion, etc. is called the natural state, in comparison to the impure consciousness. There is no fault in this. Here it is said that when this impure soul undergoes its state of attachment, aversion, and delusion, then the karmic particles (pudgala skandha) that are fit for karmic bondage, which are situated in the field of the body that is restrained by the soul, become the state of karma (dravya karma) due to their own inherent power (upādāna kāraṇarūpa śakti). And they become bound to the soul in the regions (pradeśa) in the same way that milk and water mix together. ||65||

**Time Commentary Verse 66:** The unique nature of karma is described here. Just as the pudgala substances are arranged into skandhas in many ways, so too know that karma is diverse, not created by others. ||66||

**Hindi Time Commentary Verse 66:** **Anvaya-artha:** (Yathā) Just as (pudgaladravyaṇām) the pudgala substances (bahuprakāraih) in many ways (skandhanirvṛttiḥ) are arranged into skandhas (paraiḥ akṛtā) without being done by others (dṛṣṭā) are seen, (tathā) in the same way (karmaṇām) the diversity of karma (vijānihi) know that it is not created by others.

**Commentary:** The diversity of karma (bahuprakāratā) is not done by others, it is said here. Just as when one experiences the light of the moon and sun, the evening clouds, the rainbow, and many other things, the pudgala skandha is formed without any dependence on debt, so too karma is formed without any dependence on debt, in many ways, due to the experience of the soul's state (jīvapariṇāmopa-lambhe), such as the covering of knowledge (jñānāvaraṇa), etc. ||66||

Page #199:
---------------------------
Just as the various types of skandhas are produced from pudgala without the need for any other agent, such as the rainbow, halo, etc., similarly, when a being becomes eligible for the results of karma, various types of karma, such as jnana-avaran, etc., are also produced without the need for any other agent. ||66||

Page #200:
---------------------------
**Sahavy-Pancastimapan -** In this way, there is the notion of the self as the creator in the pudgala, this is mainly stated in three gathas.

**Time Explanation Gatha 67**

It is said here that even though there is the single agency of the jiva and karma, in practice, the jiva does not contradict the experience of the fruits given by karma.

**Jivas are bound to pudgala-bodies by mutual deep grasping and attachment.** When they are separated in time, they give and experience happiness and sorrow.

**Jivas, due to their attachment to moha, raga, and dvesha, and pudgala-skandhas due to their inherent nature of being sticky, remain bound in the state of bondage, like a pair of atoms, by mutual deep grasping and attachment.** When they are separated from each other, then, due to the arising and passing away of the pudgala-body, they give happiness and sorrow as a result of their inherent nature, and in practice, they are merely the cause of the desired and undesired objects. The jivas, in practice, experience the fruits of the desired and undesired objects, which are obtained by the arising of the pudgala-karma, which are merely the cause of the happiness and sorrow that are the result of their inherent nature. Thus, the quality of the jiva as the experiencer is also explained.

**Hindi Time Explanation Gatha 67**

**Anvayaartha:** [Jivas are pudgala-bodies] The jiva and the pudgala-body [are mutually bound by deep grasping and attachment] [in a specific way] by mutual deep grasping, [mutually] bound, (when they are separated in time) when separated by time (they give and experience happiness and sorrow) they give and experience happiness and sorrow [i.e., the pudgala-body gives happiness and sorrow, and the jiva experiences it].

**Commentary:** It is said here that even though there is the single agency of the jiva and karma (only their own nature), in practice, the jiva does not contradict the experience of the fruits given by karma.

The jiva, due to its attachment to moha, raga, and dvesha, and the pudgala-skandha, due to its inherent nature of being sticky, [they] remain bound in the state of bondage, like a pair of atoms, [in a specific way] by mutual deep grasping and attachment. When they are separated from each other, then, due to the arising and passing away of the pudgala-body, they give happiness and sorrow as a result of their inherent nature, and in practice, they are merely the cause of the desired and undesired objects. The jivas, in practice, experience the fruits of the desired and undesired objects, which are obtained by the arising of the pudgala-karma, which are merely the cause of the happiness and sorrow that are the result of their inherent nature. Thus, the quality of the jiva as the experiencer is also explained.

Page #201:
---------------------------
-
The **Pancastikaya** (five-fold body) beings, from the **Udayase** (arising) of the **Dravyakarma** (matter-karma), experience the **Iṣṭāniṣṭa** (desirable and undesirable) objects, as per their **Vyavahara** (practical experience), and experience the fruits of **Sukha** (happiness) and **Duḥkha** (suffering) in that way. Thus, the **Bhoktṛtva** (experiencer) quality of the **Jiva** (soul) has also been explained. ||67||

**Sanskrit Commentary:**

Verse 67: The previous argument was made that how does the Jiva experience the fruits of **Akṛtakarma** (unperformed actions). There, the **Naya** (principle) division is used to show the logic regarding the **Phalabhoktṛtva** (fruit-experiencer) aspect. The Jivas are **Poggalakāya** (body of matter) and **Jīvakāya** (body of soul) and **Pudgalakāya** (body of matter). How are they? **Aṇṇoṇṇāgāḍhagahaṇapaḍibaddhā** (mutually bound by strong grasping), they are bound together by their own **Rāga** (attachment) etc. **Srigdharaūkṣa** (smooth and rough) etc. **Pariṇāma** (transformations) due to their previous **Anyonyāvagāha** (mutual penetration). They remain in this bound state. When they **Vijujjāmāṇaudayakā** (arise and become manifest), they give their own fruits and **Tinujārā** (leave their traces) and **Nirjaśa** (become inactive). What do they do? The **Diti** (give) **Nirvikāra** (unchanging) **Cidānanda** (bliss of consciousness) **Ekasvabhāva** (one nature) Jiva, due to **Mithyātvārāga** (false attachment) etc., has **Mithyātvam** (falsehood) in the form of **Ekatvaruci** (desire for oneness), **Mithyājnāna** (false knowledge) in the form of **Ekatvapratipatti** (understanding oneness), and **Mithyācāritra** (false conduct) in the form of **Ekatvapariṇati** (transformation into oneness). Thus, the **Pudgalas** (matter) of the **Mithyātvādi** (falsehood etc.) **Bayaparina** (transformed) Jivas are the **Kartāra** (doers) and **Dadati** (give). What do they give? **Suhadukkha** (happiness and suffering) - **Anākulata** (unperturbed) **Lakṣaṇapāramārthikasukha** (true happiness) - **Vipirīta** (opposite) **Paramākulata** (extreme perturbation) - **Utpādaka** (producing) **Abhyantaranisaye** (in the inner determination) **Harṣaviṣāda** (joy and sorrow) - **Vyavahāre** (in practical experience) **Punaḥ** (again) **Bahirviṣaye** (in external objects) **Vivideṣṭāniṣṭendriyaviṣayaprapti** (acquisition of various desirable and undesirable sense objects) - **Kaṭukaviṣarasāsvādasvabhāva** (bitter and poisonous taste) - **Sāṃsārikasukhaduḥkha** (worldly happiness and suffering) - **Bhujamti** (experience) - **Vītarāga** (free from attachment) **Paramāhādaika** (supreme bliss) **Rūpasukhamṛtarasāsvādabhojanarahitā** (devoid of the taste of the nectar of supreme bliss) **Jīvā** (souls) **Niścaye** (in determination) **Bhāvarūpa** (form of feeling) **Vyavahāreṇa** (in practical experience) **Dravyarūpa** (form of matter) **Cha** (also) **Bhujamte** (experience) **Sevanti** (enjoy) - this is the meaning. ||67||

Thus, the explanation of **Bhoktṛtva** (experiencer) is primarily contained in this verse.

**Hindi Commentary:**

Verse 67: The **Uthānika** (introduction) - the previous argument made by the student was that how does the Jiva experience the fruits of **Akṛtakarma** (unperformed actions). The answer to this is given through the **Naya** (principle) division, showing that the Jiva experiences the fruits.

**Anvaya** (word order) with **Sāmānyārtha** (general meaning): (**Jīvā**) the worldly Jivas and (**Puggalakāya**) the **Dravyakarma** (matter-karma) groups (**Aṇṇoṇṇāgāḍhagahaṇapaḍibaddhā**) are mutually bound together in a strong way. [**Kāle**] at the time of **Udayakāla** (arising) [**Vijujjāmāṇā**] the **Pudgalas** (matter) become separated from the Jiva and [**Suhadukkha**] give happiness and suffering in the form of **Sāta** (good) or **Asāta** (bad) [**Diti**] give [**Bhujamti**] then the Jivas experience them.

**Viśeṣārtha** (specific meaning): Due to their own **Rāga** (attachment) etc. **Pariṇāma** (transformations) and the **Srigdharaūkṣa** (smooth and rough) qualities in the **Padalas** (matter), the **Dravyakarma** (matter-karma) groups are already bound to the **Pradeśas** (regions) of the Jivas. When they become complete in their state and arise in **Udayakāla** (arising), they manifest their own fruits and fall away. At that time, those **Karmas** (actions) give **Suhadukkha** (happiness and suffering) to those Jivas, primarily those which are **Anākulata** (unperturbed) - **Lakṣaṇapāramārthikasukha** (true happiness) - **Vipirīta** (opposite) - **Paramākulata** (extreme perturbation) - **Utpādaka** (producing).

##  Verse 198:

**Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas**

The **Mithyadrishti** (false-sighted) view is that which considers the **Jiva** (soul) to be one with the **Nirvikar** (unchanging), **Chidananda** (blissful consciousness), **Ek-Swabhav** (one nature), and **Mithyatva** (falsehood), **Raga** (attachment), and other **Bhavas** (emotions) as one. They are **Mithyajnani** (false-knowers) who believe that the **Jiva** is inherently **Raga** (attachment), **Dvesha** (aversion), **Moha** (delusion), etc. They are **Mithyachari** (false-conduct) who engage in the **Parinamana** (transformation) of **Raga** (attachment) and other **Bhavas** (emotions). Such **Mithyadarshana** (false-view), **Mithyajnana** (false-knowledge), and **Mithyacharita** (false-conduct) lead the **Jiva** to experience inner **Ashuddha** (impure) **Nischya** (certainty) in the form of **Harsha** (joy) or **Vishada** (sorrow). In their **Vyavahara** (practical life), they experience external objects as **Ista** (desirable) or **Anishta** (undesirable) through their senses, and they experience the taste of **Madhur** (sweet) or **Katuk** (bitter) like the taste of poison, which manifests as worldly **Sukha** (pleasure) or **Dukha** (pain). They do not experience the **Vitraaga** (detachment), **Paramananda** (supreme bliss), **Sukhamrita** (nectar of happiness), and **Rasaasvada** (taste of bliss). They experience their own **Bhavas** (emotions) internally, and they experience objects externally. This is the meaning to understand.

## Verse 68:

**Timely Explanation**

This verse explains the **Kartṛtva** (agency) and **Bhoktṛtva** (enjoyment).

**Translation:**

Therefore, **Karma** (action) is connected to the **Jiva** (soul) as the **Karta** (agent) in the **Bhavas** (emotions). The **Jiva** is the **Bhoktā** (enjoyer) of the **Karmaphala** (fruits of action) due to the **Chetak** (consciousness) **Bhavas** (emotions).

**Explanation:**

Therefore, **Karma** (action) is connected to the **Jiva** (soul) as the **Karta** (agent) in the **Bhavas** (emotions). The **Jiva** is the **Bhoktā** (enjoyer) of the **Karmaphala** (fruits of action) due to the **Chetak** (consciousness) **Bhavas** (emotions).

**Conclusion:**

Thus, it is established that the **Jiva** is the **Karta** (agent) of its own **Bhavas** (emotions) in **Nischya** (certainty) and the **Karta** (agent) of the **Jiva** (soul) in **Vyavahara** (practical life). The **Jiva** is also the **Karta** (agent) of its own **Bhavas** (emotions) in **Nischya** (certainty) and the **Karta** (agent) of **Karma** (action) in **Vyavahara** (practical life). Just as **Karma** (action) is the **Karta** (agent) in both **Nischya** (certainty) and **Vyavahara** (practical life), it is not the **Bhoktā** (enjoyer) in either. Why? Because it lacks the **Chetanya** (consciousness) and **Anubhuti** (experience) that are necessary for **Sadbhavas** (existence). Therefore, only the **Jiva** (soul), due to its **Chetanatva** (consciousness), is the **Bhoktā** (enjoyer) of the **Karmaphala** (fruits of action), which are the **Sukha** (pleasure) and **Dukha** (pain) that arise from the **Jiva** (soul) itself, and the **Ista** (desirable) and **Anishta** (undesirable) objects.

**Hindi Explanation:**

**Anvayarth:**

Therefore, **Karma** (action) is connected to the **Jiva** (soul) as the **Karta** (agent) in the **Bhavas** (emotions). The **Jiva** is the **Bhoktā** (enjoyer) of the **Karmaphala** (fruits of action) due to the **Chetak** (consciousness) **Bhavas** (emotions).

The **Jiva** is also the **Karta** (agent) of its own **Bhavas** (emotions) in **Nischya** (certainty) and the **Karta** (agent) of **Karma** (action) in **Vyavahara** (practical life). Just as **Karma** (action) is the **Karta** (agent) in both **Nischya** (certainty) and **Vyavahara** (practical life), it is not the **Bhoktā** (enjoyer) in either. Why?

---------------------------
This commentary on the Panchaastikaya is a summary of the concepts of agency and experience. 

Therefore (from the previous statements), it is established that karma is the agent of its own state by certainty, and the agent of the states of the living being by convention. The living being is also the agent of its own state by certainty, and the agent of karma by convention.

Just as karma is the agent in both ways, it is not the experiencer in any way. Why? Because it does not have the capacity for conscious experience. Therefore, due to its consciousness, only the living being is known as the experiencer of the fruits of karma - in some ways, the results of happiness and suffering in the soul, and in some ways, the objects of desire and aversion. ||68||

**Sanskrit Commentary:**

Verse 68: Now, the conclusion regarding agency and experience is stated. Therefore, because there is no mutual dependence between the living being and karma as stated earlier, karma is the agent of karma. Of what? By certainty, of its own states, and by convention, of the states of the living being like attachment, etc. The living being is also the agent of the states of material karma by convention, and by certainty, of its own conscious state. How does karma become the agent of its own states? It is combined with its states, like the states of false perception, attachment, etc., and the living being is combined with the state of karma. Therefore, the living being is the experiencer. Who is the experiencer? The living being, devoid of the single experience of pure consciousness and bliss. By what is it the experiencer? By its impure conscious state, which is opposite to the supreme light of consciousness. What does it experience? The fruits of karma, which are the results of the pure and wise nature of the supreme soul, and which are the natural experience of pure and supreme bliss. Therefore, the opposite of this is the experience of worldly happiness and suffering, which is the fruit of good and bad karma. ||68||

Thus, the previous verse focused primarily on the experience of karma, while this verse focuses primarily on the conclusion regarding the agency and experience of karma. These two verses together complete the discussion.

**Hindi Commentary:**

Verse 68: The following verses summarize the various statements about the agent and the experiencer.

General Meaning: Therefore (tamha), material karma (kamma) is the agent of its own states (bhaaveṇ sanjudo) by certainty (hī), and the agent of the states of the living being (jīvasa) by convention (adha). Similarly, the living being is also the agent of its own states of attachment, etc., due to the arising of material karma (du). But, the living being (jīvo) alone, due to its impure conscious state (chedagabhaaveṇ), becomes the experiencer (bhotta) of the fruits of karma (kammaphala).

Specific Meaning: Because we have already stated that the living being is not the material cause of material karma, and material karma is not the material cause of the states of the living being, therefore, material karma is the agent of its own states of knowledge-obscuration, etc., which are its material causes. By convention, it is the agent of the states of attachment, etc., of the living being.

Page #204:

The one who describes the six substances and five astikayas is also the doer of his own conscious states. In practice, he is the doer of the karma-bond of the substance. This pudgala substance, being associated with the false views, attachment, etc., related to the jiva, is the doer of its karmic states. Similarly, the jiva is also the doer of attachment, etc., due to the arising of past karma. And this jiva, being alone, without any change, pure consciousness, bliss, and single experience, experiences the opposite of its own supreme consciousness, the impure conscious state, due to the pure knowledge, single nature, and the feeling of the supreme soul principle. It experiences the opposite of the natural, pure, supreme bliss, the fruit of the experience, in the form of worldly happiness and sorrow, the fruit of good or bad karma. This is the meaning. ||68||

In this way, the previous verse mainly spoke of the being who experiences karma. Here, two verses are spoken mainly about the contraction of the statement of both the doer and the experiencer of karma.

Time Explanation Verse 69 Karma-sammutam asukhena

Hindi Time Explanation Verse 69 Anvayarth (evam) in this way (svakai karmabhih) by his own karma (karta bhotta bhavan) being the doer and experiencer (atma) the soul (mohasanchannah) being covered by delusion (param aparam sansaram) in the finite or infinite world (hindate) wanders.

Commentary - This is an explanation of the dominant quality of the power of the soul due to its association with karma.

In this way, due to the manifested power of the soul, which has taken the authority of being the doer and experiencer through its own karma, this soul, due to its being covered by the delusion of the beginningless, has given rise to opposite attachment, and the light of right knowledge has been extinguished, therefore, it wanders in the finite or infinite world. ||69||

Page #205:
---------------------------
**Verse 69**

**Sanskrit Commentary:**

The verse reiterates the previous statement about the dominance of karma, emphasizing its primary role. It explains that the soul, though not truly the doer or enjoyer of karma in absolute terms, is considered so in conventional terms. This is due to the soul's association with karma, as explained in the previous sections. The soul, thus, becomes the doer and enjoyer. Who is this soul? It is the **ap-atma** (individual soul). What are the causes of this? It is due to the **sangehi kammehi** (karmas of its own, both auspicious and inauspicious). What does the soul do, thus burdened? It **hindadi** (wanders, wanders, roams). Where does it wander? In **samsara** (the cycle of birth and death), which is finite, unlike the infinite samsara of the liberated soul. What is the specific nature of this samsara? It is **param** (transcendable) for the **bhavya** (those destined for liberation) and **aparam** (untranscendable) for the **abhavya** (those not destined for liberation). What is the nature of the soul? It is **mohasanchanno** (obscured by delusion), meaning that though it is free from delusion in absolute terms, it is still considered to be veiled by delusion in conventional terms. This is because it is still subject to **darshanacharitramohasanchanna** (delusion in perception, conduct, and knowledge).

**Hindi Commentary:**

The verse reiterates the dominance of karma, as explained earlier.

**General Meaning with Anvaya:**

Just as we have said before, this worldly soul, due to its own auspicious and inauspicious karmas, becomes the doer, enjoyer, and experiencer. It is obscured by delusion and wanders in the cycle of birth and death, which is transcendable for those destined for liberation and untranscendable for those not destined for liberation.

**Specific Meaning:**

Although the soul is not truly the doer or enjoyer of karma in absolute terms, it is considered so in conventional terms. This is because it is the doer and enjoyer of its own pure nature, and also because it is the doer and enjoyer of its own auspicious and inauspicious karmas in conventional terms. It wanders in this cycle of four births, which is finite and different from the infinite samsara of the liberated soul. This soul is free from delusion in absolute terms, but is still considered to be veiled by delusion in conventional terms, as it is still subject to delusion in perception, conduct, and knowledge.

##  Verse 202: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

**Commentary:** This verse explains the quality of mastery (Prabhutva) through the lens of being free from karma.

**Verse 70:**

The one who has attained the path, as spoken by the Jinas, with their calmed and diminished delusion,
The wise one, who walks the path of knowledge and understanding, reaches the city of liberation. ||7||

**Explanation:**

If this very soul, having attained the path as instructed by the Jinas, with calmed and diminished delusion, having eradicated the opposite attachment, with the light of right knowledge shining forth, having ended the authority of being the doer and the enjoyer, and having manifested the power of mastery through right knowledge, walks the path of understanding, then they reach the city of liberation, which is the realization of the pure soul essence. ||70||

**Hindi Commentary:**

Verse 70:

**Anvayaartha:** (Jinbhaasiten marg samupgatah) The one who has attained the path through the words of the Jinas, (upashaant ksheen mohah) with calmed and diminished delusion (meaning, the one whose delusion of perception has been calmed, destroyed, or calmed and destroyed), (jnaan anumaarg chaari) walks the path of knowledge and understanding (walks the path of following knowledge), (dheerah) that wise person (nirvaan puran vrajati) attains the city of liberation.

**Tika:** This is an explanation of the quality of mastery through the principle of being free from karma.

When this very soul, having attained the path as instructed by the Jinas, due to calmed and diminished delusion (due to the calming, destruction, or calming and destruction of the delusion of perception), with the opposite attachment eradicated, with the light of right knowledge shining forth, having ended the authority of being the doer and the enjoyer, and having manifested the power of mastery through right knowledge, walks the path of understanding (conducts themselves), then they reach the city of liberation (the city of liberation), which is the realization of the pure soul essence. ||7||

**Sanskrit Commentary:**

Verse 70:

Here, the previously mentioned mastery is again explained, with the principle of being free from karma as the main point. Uvasant ksheen mohah means calmed and diminished delusion; the term anopashama refers to the state of right conduct with no calming, ksheena refers to the state of right conduct with diminished delusion, and both together refer to the state of right conduct with calmed and diminished delusion. The path of liberation is the path of certainty, conduct, and liberation, which is threefold in nature: the jewel of distinction, the jewel of non-distinction, and the jewel of both. Samupgatah means attained, by whom? By Jinbhaasiden, the one who speaks the words of the Jinas, the one who is free from attachment and all-knowing. Naan refers to the knowledge that is free from modification and self-awareness, and abheden refers to the pure soul, which is its foundation. Anu refers to the knowledge quality, which is considered as the soul, by being considered as the soul.

Page #207:
---------------------------
The **Panchaastikaya** (five categories of existence) are described as follows:

**203** The **Magmachari** (one who follows the path of liberation) is described as one who has attained certainty in **Nischya** (knowledge), **Vyavahar** (conduct), and **Mokshamarg** (path of liberation). Such a **Bhavya** (evolving soul) is like a **Punḍarīka** (lotus) with many virtues and **vajdi** (goes, proceeds) towards **Nivvāṇapura** (city of liberation), which is characterized by **atyāvāśa** (supreme bliss), **sukha** (happiness), and **anantpaṇā** (infinite qualities), and is the realization of the **śuddhatmā** (pure soul).

What further distinguishes this **Bhavya**? They are **dhīra** (steadfast), meaning they remain steadfast in their **Nischya Ratna Tray** (three jewels of certainty) even during **ghāropaśarga** (severe trials), like the **Pāṇḍavas** (heroes of the Mahabharata).

This is the explanation of **karma-rahittva** (being free from karma) in the second **gāthā** (verse).

Similarly, the seven **pariharagāthās** (verses of refutation) starting with "**Ogāḍhayā**" have been explained in the previous order.

Thus, in the nine **adhikaras** (chapters) on the **Jīvāastikāya** (categories of the soul), including **Prabhutva** (sovereignty) and other topics, the **Jīvā aṇāiṇihaṇā** (the soul is not a destroyer) and the other eighteen **gāthās** collectively explain the **kṛtṛtva** (agency), **bhoktṛtva** (enjoyment), and **karma-samyuktatva** (being connected with karma) together.

**Hindi Summary:**

**Gāthā 70** explains the importance of being free from karma, even after attaining **Prabhutva** (sovereignty).

**General Meaning:**

The **Jina** (liberated soul) teaches that the **Bhavya** (evolving soul) attains the **Mokshamarg** (path of liberation) by following the **Samayagnyāna** (right knowledge) and becoming **dhīra** (steadfast). They overcome **moha** (delusion) and reach **Nivvāṇapura** (city of liberation).

**Specific Meaning:**

The **Bhavya** understands the **Nischya** (knowledge), **Vyavahar** (conduct), and **Mokshamarg** (path of liberation) taught by the **Vītarāga** (free from attachment) and **Sarvajña** (omniscient) **Praṇīta** (liberated soul). They attain **Upasama** (sublimation), **Samyaktva** (right faith), **Kṣayopasama** (sublimation of karma), and **Kṣāyika Samyaktva** (right faith leading to liberation). They remain steadfast in their **Nischya Ratna Tray** (three jewels of certainty) even during **ghāropaśarga** (severe trials), like the **Pāṇḍavas** (heroes of the Mahabharata). They overcome **moha** (delusion) and reach **Nivvāṇapura** (city of liberation), which is characterized by **atyāvāśa** (supreme bliss), **sukha** (happiness), and **anantpaṇā** (infinite qualities), and is the realization of the **śuddhatmā** (pure soul).

This is the explanation of **karma-rahittva** (being free from karma) in the second **gāthā** (verse).

Similarly, the seven **pariharagāthās** (verses of refutation) starting with "**Ogāḍhayā**" have been explained in the previous order.

Thus, in the nine **adhikaras** (chapters) on the **Jīvāastikāya** (categories of the soul), including **Prabhutva** (sovereignty) and other topics, the **Jīvā aṇāiṇihaṇā** (the soul is not a destroyer) and the other eighteen **gāthās** collectively explain the **kṛtṛtva** (agency), **bhoktṛtva** (enjoyment), and **karma-samyuktatva** (being connected with karma) together.

## Description of the Six Categories of the Soul

**Verse 71-72**

**Time Explanation**

The soul is described as one, two-fold, three-marked, four-moving, five-quality-dominant, six-category-bound, seven-fold-existent, eight-based, nine-meaningful, and ten-located.

**Verse 71**

* **One:** The soul is one because it is eternally conscious and active.
* **Two-fold:** The soul is two-fold because of the difference between knowledge and perception.
* **Three-marked:** The soul is three-marked because it is characterized by the difference between karma, its fruits, and the knowledge of action.

**Verse 72**

* **Four-moving:** The soul is four-moving because it moves through the four states of existence.
* **Five-quality-dominant:** The soul is five-quality-dominant because it is primarily characterized by the five qualities of the soul: *parinaamika*, *audarika*, etc.
* **Six-category-bound:** The soul is six-category-bound because it is bound by the six categories of existence: upward, downward, and the four directions.
* **Seven-fold-existent:** The soul is seven-fold-existent because it exists in the seven states of being: *asti*, *nasti*, etc.
* **Eight-based:** The soul is eight-based because it is the basis of the eight qualities of karma.
* **Nine-meaningful:** The soul is nine-meaningful because it is the essence of the nine categories of reality.
* **Ten-located:** The soul is ten-located because it resides in the ten locations of existence: earth, water, fire, air, plants, and the five senses.

**Hindi Time Explanation**

The verses describe the different categories of the soul.

**Explanation**

The soul is one because it is eternally conscious and active. It is two-fold because of the difference between knowledge and perception. It is three-marked because it is characterized by the difference between karma, its fruits, and the knowledge of action. It is four-moving because it moves through the four states of existence. It is five-quality-dominant because it is primarily characterized by the five qualities of the soul: *parinaamika*, *audarika*, etc. It is six-category-bound because it is bound by the six categories of existence: upward, downward, and the four directions. It is seven-fold-existent because it exists in the seven states of being: *asti*, *nasti*, etc. It is eight-based because it is the basis of the eight qualities of karma. It is nine-meaningful because it is the essence of the nine categories of reality. It is ten-located because it resides in the ten locations of existence: earth, water, fire, air, plants, and the five senses.

## The Soul: A Detailed Description

**The Soul (Jiva)** is described as:

(1) **One** (Eka):  Just as a single lump of gold represents all gold, the soul, with its infinite qualities of knowledge, etc., represents the pure soul category. 
(2) **Great Soul** (Mahapa):  The soul is also considered a Great Soul due to its inherent potential for liberation and its ability to attain perfect knowledge and vision.
(3) **Suitable** (Uvajutta):  The soul is suitable for liberation because it possesses the potential for perfect knowledge and vision.
(4) **Two-fold** (Duviyappa):  The soul can be categorized as either a worldly soul (samsari) or a liberated soul (mukta). It can also be categorized as either destined for liberation (bhavya) or not destined for liberation (abhavya).
(5) **Three-marked** (Tilakkhano):  The soul is characterized by three marks: knowledge, karma, and the fruit of karma. It can also be characterized by three other sets of three: 
    * Knowledge, perception, and conduct
    * Substance, quality, and mode
    * Origination, decay, and permanence
(6) **Four-fold in movement** (Chadu Sankamo):  Although the soul's true nature is unchanging and blissful, it appears to move through the four realms of hell, animal, human, and heavenly beings due to its attachment to false beliefs and desires.
(7) **Five-fold in dominant qualities** (Panchaggagunapphaano):  Although the soul's true nature is characterized by the two qualities of impermanence and purity, it is generally dominated by the five main qualities:  audayika, etc.
(8) **Six-fold in deviation** (Chhakkaavakamajutto):  The soul is characterized by six deviations, which are the six directions of movement (up, down, and the four cardinal directions) that it takes when transitioning to another existence.
(9) **Seven-fold in existence** (Sattbhangasambhavo):  The soul's existence is characterized by seven categories of existence: being, non-being, etc.
(10) **Eight-fold in dependence** (Atthasavo):  The soul is dependent on eight karmas (knowledge-obscuring, etc.) or eight qualities (right faith, etc.).
(11) **Nine-fold in substance** (Nava-artharoopa):  The soul exists as one of the nine substances.
(12) **Ten-fold in location** (Dasasthanagata):  The soul can be found in ten different locations: earth, water, fire, air, ordinary plants, specific plants, two-sensed beings, three-sensed beings, four-sensed beings, and five-sensed beings.

##  Six Substances - Description of the Five Astikayas

Though the soul is the abode of the eight virtues like perfect knowledge, in practical terms, it is the source of the eight karmas and the eight types of knowledge-obscuring karmas. Though it appears as a single, undivided entity of pure knowledge, in the state of non-discriminatory samadhi, in practical terms, it is like gold in various forms, found in different colors. Though it is essentially pure consciousness, in practical terms, it is found in ten locations, namely earth, water, fire, air, space, plants, two-senses, three-senses, four-senses, and five-senses. Who is this? It is the soul - the soul substance. Thus, it exists in ten forms. Alternatively, in the second explanation, when the ten locations are explained separately, using appropriate terms, then those ten locations also become ten forms. Thus, there are twenty forms in total, combining both explanations.  

**Hindi Meaning:**

This section further elaborates on the soul substance, as described in the previous nine chapters, by explaining its ten forms, leading to a total of twenty forms.

**General Meaning with Anvaya:**

(Uvadatto) The soul, which is useful (Eko cheva mahayya) is one great soul, in terms of its essence. (So duviyapppo) The same soul is of two types. (Tilakkhano hodi) It has three characteristics. (Chaduchankamano bhanido) It is said to be of four types, due to its movement in the four realms. (Panchaggagunappadhanno ya) It is of five forms, due to its possession of five main qualities. (Chhakkapakkamajutto) It is of six forms, due to its movement in six directions. (Sattabhang sabbhavo) It is of seven forms, due to its being established by seven categories. (Atthasao) It is of eight forms, due to being the abode of eight virtues. (Navattho) It is of nine forms, due to being present in nine substances. (Das thanago) It is of ten forms, due to being present in ten locations. (Jivo) This soul is said to be (bhanido) of ten forms.

**Specific Meaning:**

Just as gold is considered one, despite its various forms and qualities, due to its inherent nature, similarly, the soul is considered one, despite its infinite qualities like perfect knowledge and perfect vision, due to its inherent nature as a pure soul. Alternatively, the soul is considered one, due to the presence of perfect vision and perfect knowledge in all souls. This is the common characteristic, making the soul one. Some may argue that just as the moon appears in different forms in different water-filled pots, similarly, the soul appears in different forms in different bodies. This doubt is resolved by stating that the moon's rays are reflected in the water, making the water particles appear like the moon, not the moon itself. Similarly, the soul is not changing its form, but its qualities are reflected in the body.

---------------------------
The five astikayas have been explained. In this, there is also an example - just as in various mirrors, due to the dependence on the face of Devadatta, i.e., the face being reflected in the cleanliness of the mirrors, the pudgalas of the various mirrors have undergone transformation in the form of various faces. The face of Devadatta has not undergone transformation into many forms of faces. If this were to happen, then the reflection of the face in the mirror would attain the state of consciousness, which does not happen. In the same way, one moon does not undergo transformation into various forms, and no single substance called Brahma is seen which would become of various types like the moon. This implies that one jiva cannot transform into various jivas, only the species aspect or the aspect of common qualities is one type for all jivas, and this jiva is of two types in terms of the aspect of perception-action, or the aspect of worldly and liberated, or the aspect of bhavya and abhavya. The same jiva is of three characteristics in terms of the aspect of knowledge-consciousness, karma-consciousness, or karma-result-consciousness, or the aspect of production-expenditure-maturity, or the aspect of samyagdarshan, samyagjnan, samyagcharitra, or the aspect of dravya-guna-paryaya. Although it possesses the nature of remaining in the state of Siddha-gati by possessing the single characteristic of being unchanging, pure, and full of knowledge and bliss, due to its wandering in the four gatis of hell, etc., due to its transformation in the states of mithyadarshan and emotions like raga and dvesha, it is said to be of four types. Although it possesses the two characteristics of being kshayika and pure parinamik, due to its dwelling in the five main bhavya states of audayika, etc., it is of five types. And the same jiva is of six types due to its being associated with six upkrama. The meaning of this statement is that the one in which the reverse order is destroyed is called upkrama, i.e., this jiva goes to the end of death in the upward, downward, and four directions - east, west, south, north, as it is said - "Anushreni gati" that the movement of the jiva is sequential. It does not go in crooked directions. For this reason, it is of six types. The same jiva is proved by the seven bhangas of dravya - syat asti, syat nasti, syat astinasti, syat avaktvy, syat asti avaktvy, syat nasti avaktvy, syat astinasti avaktvy, so it is of seven types. Although this jiva is the basis of eight qualities like samyaktva, etc., which are characterized by being free from attachment, etc., due to its being associated with eight karmas like jnana-avaran, etc., and asrava, it is of eight types. Although this jiva appears as one undivided knowledge-form in the state of nirvikalpa samadhi, which is a common quality found in all jivas, due to its pervading in nine substances like jiva, ajiv, asrava, bandha, samvara, nirjara, moksha, punya, papa, like gold spread in various gold substances, it is of nine forms. Although it is the possessor of the single characteristic of pure buddhi,

## 208. Description of the Six Ways and Five Bodies

However, according to the practical point of view, due to being earth, water, fire, air, each plant, ordinary plant, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed, there are ten locations or ten forms. Or, if these ten locations of earth, etc., are taken separately, and the above terms are explained separately, then there are also ten locations. By combining both, this living being becomes twenty-fold. This is the meaning. ||71-72||

**Time Explanation Verse 73**

**Pali:**
*Payaḍḍiḍi - aṇubhāga-ppadeśa bandhehiṁ savvado mukko.
Uḍḍuṁ gacchadi sesa vidisā - vajjaṁ gadiṁ janti.* ||73||

**Sanskrit:**
*Prakṛtisthityanubhāgapradeśabandhaiḥ sarvato muktaḥ.
Ūrdhvam gacchati śeṣā vidigvaj gatiṁ yānti.* ||73||

**Explanation:**
The bound living being has six ways of going due to karma, but the liberated one has only one upward movement, which is natural. This is stated here. ||73||

**Hindi Time Explanation 73**

**Meaning:**
(Prakṛtisthityanubhāgapradeśabandhaiḥ) The living being who is free from the bonds of nature, state, part, and region (sarvato muktaḥ) goes upward (ūrdhvam gacchati), while the rest (śeṣāḥ) go to other existences (bhavantaram) leaving behind the directions (vidigvaj gatiṁ yānti).

**Commentary:**
The bound living being has six ways of going (six directions) due to karma, while the liberated living being also has one natural upward movement. This is stated here. ||73||

Thus, the explanation of the body of the living being is complete.

**Sanskrit Meaning Explanation Verse 73**

Now, it is stated that the liberated one has an upward movement, while the worldly beings have six ways at the time of death. *Paryāḍḍiḍi aṇubhāgapadeśabandhehiṁ savvado mukko* - The liberated one, being free from all attachments, is free from the forms of nature, state, part, and region, and is pure, with the power of meditation, which is the characteristic of pure self-realization. *Uṅkaṁ gacchadi* - Being endowed with natural infinite knowledge and other qualities, he goes upward, which is the characteristic of one-time movement. *Sesa* - The rest of the worldly beings, *vidisāvajjaṁ gardi janti* - at the time of death, they go in the direction of the six ways, which are mentioned earlier, and which are the characteristics of the sequence of the six ways. In the verse, *“Sadasiva sankho makkani buddho neiyāigo ya vaisesa. Mandalī daṁsaṇa vidūṣaṇa kayaan aṭṭha”* (Gommatasara Jīvakāṇḍa Gāthā 69-68), the meaning of the eight kinds of karma is stated, and the eight kinds of karma are prohibited.

Page #213:
---------------------------
The second verse describes the nature of the Siddhas, stating that they are free from the five astikayas and are liberated. The Siddhas are described as being free from the eight karmas and residing in the highest realm. This verse refutes the Sadashiva doctrine, which claims that the soul is always free from karmic impurities. It also refutes the Mimamsa doctrine, which denies the existence of liberation. Furthermore, it refutes the Sankhya doctrine, which claims that the soul is not happy in liberation. The verse also states that the Siddhas are never bound by karma again. 

This is the fourth chapter of the first Maha-Adhikara, which deals with the six substances, specifically the Jiva-astikaya. This chapter consists of 35 verses, which are divided into three sections: the first verse introduces the nine Adhikaras, the next three verses describe the nature of the Jiva, the next two verses describe the Jiva's body, the next three verses describe the Jiva's non-material nature, the next two verses describe the Jiva's three types of consciousness, the next 19 verses describe the Jiva's knowledge and perception, the next 18 verses describe the Jiva's actions, and the final three verses are in the form of a Chulika.

## 210
**Description of the Six Substances and the Five Astikayas**

The term "unstained" (niranjjan) refutes the view of the Maskari ascetics, who believe that after liberation, karma-binding and worldly existence return. (5) The liberated souls (siddhas) are imperishable. They never abandon the nature of their pure, conscious substance. This refutes the Buddhist view, which does not accept any eternal substance in ultimate reality. They consider consciousness to be momentary and a product of the chain of causation. (6) The liberated souls possess the eight qualities of perfect knowledge, perfect vision, infinite power, subtle qualities, the ability to perceive, the qualities of greatness and smallness, and the quality of unimpededness. This refutes the Nyaya and Vaisheshika views, which consider the absence of knowledge and other qualities as liberation. (7) The liberated souls are fulfilled. They have nothing left to do and are perfectly content. This refutes the view of those who consider God to be the creator. (8) The liberated souls reside in the upper part of the universe. This refutes the view of the Mandalika, who say that the soul always moves upwards and never rests anywhere. This verse refutes eight different views.

The liberated souls are free from eight types of karma: the karma of delusion obscures perfect knowledge, the karma of knowledge-obscuration and vision-obscuration obscures perfect knowledge and perfect vision, the karma of obstruction obscures infinite power, the karma of name obscures subtle qualities, the karma of lifespan obscures the ability to perceive, the karma of lineage obscures the qualities of greatness and smallness, and the karma of experience obscures the quality of unimpededness. With the destruction of these eight karmas, the eight qualities of the liberated souls become manifest. The second verse describes the nature of the liberated soul by stating that they reside in the upper part of the universe. ||73||

Thus, three verses have been spoken in the form of a chulika, explaining the nine rights regarding the jiva-astikaya.

In this way, the first verse informs about the nine rights, including the statement "jiva utti havdi cheda," etc. The second verse emphasizes the sovereignty. The third verse describes the nature of the jiva. The second verse states that the body is evidence. The third verse explains the intangible qualities. The second verse describes the three types of consciousness. The next verse explains the knowledge, vision, and use. The eighteenth verse mainly explains the concepts of doership, enjoyership, and karma-boundness. The three verses are in the form of a chulika. In this way, thirty-three verses have been spoken in the first maha-adhikaran, which describes the six substances and the five astikayas, and the fourth antar-adhikaran, called jiva-astikaya, is complete.

## The Fourfold Nature of Pudgala

This is an explanation of the nature of Pudgala dravya.

**The fourfold nature of Pudgala dravya is to be known:**

* **Skandha:**  Skandha
* **Skandhadesa:** Skandha-region
* **Skandhapradesa:** Skandha-subregion
* **Paramāṇu:** Atom

**Explanation:**

Pudgala dravya exists in these four forms: sometimes as Skandha, sometimes as Skandhadesa, sometimes as Skandhapradesa, and sometimes as Paramāṇu. There is no other possibility. This is why they are said to have fourfold nature.

**Further Explanation:**

This is a statement about the different forms of Pudgala dravya.

Pudgala dravya exists in the world sometimes as Skandha, sometimes as Skandhadesa, sometimes as Skandhapradesa, and sometimes as Paramāṇu. There is no other possibility. This is why they are said to have fourfold nature.

Page #216:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**212**

There are descriptions of the six substances and the five categories of matter. There are atoms and aggregates of atoms. Thus, these four types of pudgala-kaya should be known. These four types are to be known as aggregates, atoms, and the distinction between them. Here, the meaning is that this pudgala-dravya is an object of renunciation because it is different from the infinite, blissful, pure jiva-astikaya, which is worthy of being grasped. ||74||

**Commentary:**

There are ten verses in the section on pudgala-astikaya, which is worthy of renunciation, being different from the pure jiva-astikaya, which is characterized by infinite bliss and consciousness. Among these, four verses are primarily about the aggregates, starting with the verse "Khandā ya Khandadeso". Then, five verses are primarily about the atoms, in another section. Among these five, one verse, "Sanchesim Khandānam", describes the nature of the atom. One verse, "Ādesamatta", refutes the idea that different types of matter like earth, water, etc., arise from atoms. One verse, "Saddo Khandappabhavō", establishes that the word "pudgala" is a synonym for the substance. One verse, "Nichoṇāṇavagāsō", describes the time, etc., based on the space occupied by the atomic substance, and mentions the number, unity, etc. One verse, "Airasavaṇṇa", describes the taste, color, etc., of the atomic substance. Thus, there are five verses in another section, collectively describing the atomic substance. Then, one verse, "Uvabhojjā", describes the contraction of the pudgala-astikaya. Thus, there are ten verses in three sections, collectively describing the pudgala-astikaya. Further, four types of pudgala are described.

**General Meaning with Anvaya:**

(Khandā) Aggregate (ya) and (Khandadesa) aggregate-space (ya) and (Khandapadesa) aggregate-region, these are three types of aggregates, and (Paramāṇū) atom (hoti) exists. (Idi) These (Chaduviyappā) four types (Te Poggalakāya) those pudgala-kaya (Muṇeyavya) should be known.

**Specific Meaning:**

Here, the meaning is that this pudgala-dravya is an object of renunciation because it is different from the infinite, blissful, pure jiva-astikaya, which is worthy of being grasped. ||74||

**75**

(Khandam) Aggregate is (Sayalasammattham) all-pervading, (Tassa) of it (Du) two (Addham) halves (Bhaṇanti) are said (Deso) space. (Addhaddham) Half of half (Cha) and (Padeso) region (Paramāṇū) atom (Cheva) also (A विभागी) indivisible. ||75||

**Translation:**

The aggregate is all-pervading. They say that space is half of it. Half of half is region, and the atom is indivisible. ||75||

Page #217:
---------------------------
This is a description of the different forms of the pudgala dravya.

Even though it is made up of an infinite number of atoms, the one that is made up of all of them is called a skandha. Half of that is called a skandhadesa, and half of that is called a skandhapradesa. In this way, due to the difference, there are an infinite number of skandhapradesa forms, from the dvianuka skandha. The indivisible, single-part skandha is the single atom.

Again, from the combination of two atoms, there is one dvianuka skandha form. In this way, due to the combination, there are an infinite number of skandha forms. In this way, due to both difference and combination, there are an infinite number of forms.

Page #218:
---------------------------
## Chapter 214: Description of the Sixfold and Fivefold Categories

This chapter explains the characteristics of each of the four categories (Skandha, Skandha-Desha, Skandha-Pradesha, and Paramanu) mentioned earlier.

**General Meaning with Anvaya:**

* **Skandha** is a collection of many atoms.
* **Skandha-Desha** is half of the atoms in a Skandha.
* **Skandha-Pradesha** is half of the Skandha-Desha.
* **Paramanu** is the smallest indivisible atom.

**Specific Meaning:**

A collection of atoms, combined together in an unbroken form, is called a Skandha. This is a single mass of infinite atoms, and it is called a Skandha. 

For example, consider a Skandha formed by 16 atoms. By reducing the number of atoms one by one, we can identify different types of Skandhas, starting from a Skandha with 9 atoms (the smallest) and ending with a Skandha with 16 atoms (the largest). The Skandhas with 10 to 15 atoms are the intermediate types.

A collection of 8 atoms is called Skandha-Desha, as it is half of the 16-atom Skandha. By reducing the number of atoms one by one, we can identify different types of Skandha-Desha, starting from a Skandha-Desha with 5 atoms (the smallest) and ending with a Skandha-Desha with 8 atoms (the largest). The Skandha-Deshas with 6 and 7 atoms are the intermediate types.

A collection of 4 atoms is called Skandha-Pradesha. By reducing the number of atoms one by one, we can identify different types of Skandha-Pradesha, starting from a Skandha-Pradesha with 2 atoms (the smallest) and ending with a Skandha-Pradesha with 4 atoms (the largest). The Skandha-Pradesha with 3 atoms is the intermediate type.

The smallest indivisible particle is called a Paramanu. Skandhas are formed by the combination of Paramanus. A Skandha formed by two Paramanus is called a Vyaguna Skandha, and a Skandha formed by three Paramanus is called a Tryanuka Skandha. In this way, we can identify Skandhas formed by an infinite number of Paramanus.

Thus, there are infinite types of Skandhas formed by both the difference (Bheda) and the combination (Sanghata) of Paramanus and Skandhas. This means that Skandhas are formed by the combination of Paramanus or Skandhas, and smaller Skandhas are formed by the difference of larger Skandhas. Also, Skandhas are formed by both the difference and combination of Paramanus, such as when some Paramanus are removed and others are added.

The implication here is that all these Pudgalas are different from the Supreme Self, which is worthy of being attained. This is the fruit of the knowledge of Pudgalas.

**Verse 75:** This explains the application of Pudgalas in Skandhas.

**Verse 76:** This explains that the application of Pudgalas in Skandhas is like the application of oil in a lamp.

Page #219:
---------------------------
The twenty-one-five skandhas, beginning with the Badara-Sookshma, are called Pudgala. They are of six types, from which the three worlds are created. || 76 || 

Because of their special qualities of touch, taste, smell, and color, and because of their increase and decrease in the six locations, and because of their nature of filling and dissolving, and because of the filling and dissolving that occurs due to the appearance and disappearance of the individual skandhas, the atoms are called Pudgala. The skandhas are called Pudgala because they are made up of many Pudgalas and are not different from them. They have become six types due to the differences in their Badara and Sookshma forms, and they exist in the form of the three worlds. These six types of skandhas are: (1) Badara-Badara, (2) Badara, (3) Badara-Sookshma, (4) Sookshma-Badara, (5) Sookshma, (6) Sookshma-Sookshma. 

Here, (1) wood, stone, etc., which cannot join themselves after being broken, are Badara-Badara. (2) Milk, ghee, oil, water, juice, etc., which can join themselves after being broken, are Badara. (3) Shadow, sunlight, darkness, moonlight, etc., which cannot be cut, broken, or grasped even though they are gross, are Badara-Sookshma. (4) Touch, taste, smell, and sound, which are gross even though they are subtle, are Sookshma-Badara. (5) Karma-Vargana, etc., which are subtle and cannot be perceived by the senses, are Sookshma. (6) Those which are extremely subtle, from Karma-Vargana down to the Dvi-Anuka-Skandha, are Sookshma-Sookshma. || 76 ||

**English Translation:**

This text describes the concept of pudgal (matter) in Jain philosophy, specifically focusing on the six substances (ṣaḍdravya) and the five astikayas (types of matter).

It states that while in absolute knowledge (niścaya), only atoms (paramāṇu) are considered pudgal, in practical knowledge (vyavahāra), even aggregates of atoms, including those in subtle and gross forms (bādarasūksmagataskaṇḍhā), are considered pudgal.

These aggregates of atoms are classified into six types (ṣaṭprakārāḥ), which are responsible for the creation of the three realms (trailokya). The text emphasizes that the three realms are not created by any particular being (puruṣaviśeṣa) but are formed by the six substances, including pudgal.

The text also mentions that the living being (jīva) is considered a pure being (siddhārūpa) in absolute knowledge, but in practical knowledge, it is categorized based on its various characteristics, including its lifespan, strength, senses, and breath.

The text concludes by stating that the three realms are composed of the six substances, including pudgal, and are not created, destroyed, or maintained by any particular being.

---------------------------
## The Atom (Paramanu)

**217**

**217** The atom is defined as follows:

The atom is the ultimate constituent of all the skandhas (aggregates). It is eternal, soundless, indivisible, and the source of form. ||77||

The ultimate constituent of all the skandhas, know that as the atom! It is eternal, soundless, indivisible, and the source of form. ||77||

The ultimate difference among the various forms of the skandhas is the atom. It is indivisible due to the absence of division, it is one due to being indivisible and having a single location, it is eternal due to being indestructible as a material substance, and it is the source of form due to being generated from the transformation of form, etc. It is also soundless, as sound is not a property of the atom, and it will be explained further as a form of the pudgala skandha (matter aggregate). ||77||

**Meaning of the verse:**

(Of all the skandhas) All the skandhas (the ultimate constituent) the ultimate part (that) it (the atom know) know as the atom (it) it (indivisible) indivisible (one) one, (single location) (eternal) eternal, (the source of form) the source of form (generated from form) and (soundless) soundless.

**Commentary:**

This is the explanation of the atom.

The ultimate difference (smallest part) among the previously mentioned forms of the skandhas is the atom. And it is indivisible due to the absence of division, it is one due to being indivisible and having a single location, it is eternal due to being indestructible as a material substance, and it is the source of form due to being generated from the transformation of form, etc. It is also soundless, as sound is not a property of the atom, and it will be explained further (in verse 79) as a form of the pudgala skandha (matter aggregate). ||77||

**Translation of the Sanskrit text:**

Now, he explains those six differences: earth, water, light, the object of sight, the object of the four senses, and karma-related. Those that are past karma are the six types of pudgalas. What are they like? They are coarse-coarse, coarse-fine, fine-coarse, and fine-fine. For example: those that are broken and cannot be joined together by themselves are coarse-coarse, like mountains and earth; those that are broken but can be joined together immediately by themselves are coarse-fine, like ghee, oil, and water; those that cannot be grasped by hand or moved from one place to another are fine-coarse, like light and heat; those that are not the object of sight are fine-coarse, like the object of the four senses; and those that are not suitable for the destruction of the karma of knowledge-obscuration, etc., are fine-fine.

## Chapter 218: Description of the Six Substances and Five Subtle Bodies

**Verse 1:** The objects of the senses, which are described as the six substances and five subtle bodies, are extremely subtle and beyond the reach of karma. They are extremely subtle, ranging from those beyond the reach of karma to the subtle particles of the skandha.

**Commentary:**

* **General Meaning:**  There are six types of pudgala (matter) - four objects of the senses (excluding earth, water, shadow, and visual objects), karma-worthy pudgala, and subtle skandhas formed by karma.
* **Specific Meaning:** There are six types of pudgala: (1) Gross-Gross, (2) Gross, (3) Gross-Subtle, (4) Subtle-Gross, (5) Subtle, (6) Subtle-Subtle.
    * **Gross-Gross:** Those that cannot be reunited when broken down, such as mountains, earth, pots, and cloth.
    * **Gross:** Those that can be reunited immediately when separated, such as ghee, oil, and water.
    * **Gross-Subtle:** Those that can be seen but cannot be picked up and moved, such as shadow, sunlight, and light.
    * **Subtle-Gross:** Those that cannot be seen with the eyes, such as air, taste, smell, and sound (objects of the other four senses).
    * **Subtle:** Those that cannot be perceived by any sense, such as the pudgala that is the object of the jnana (knowledge) of the liberated soul.
    * **Subtle-Subtle:** Those that are even subtler than karma, extending to the two-atom skandha.

**This verse is not found in the commentary by Amrit Chandra.**

**Thus, the first four verses of this chapter primarily focus on the explanation of the skandha.**

**Verse 2:**  Next, the second chapter focuses on the explanation of the paramanu (atom).

**Verse 3:**  The paramanu is described as having the qualities of eternity, non-sound, oneness, and indivisibility.

* **Eternity:** Just as the supreme soul is eternal due to its unchanging nature and existence as the cause of all things, the paramanu is also eternal due to its existence as pudgala.
* **Non-Sound:** Just as the pure soul, although the object of knowledge and self-awareness, is not sound, the paramanu, although the cause of sound, is not sound itself.
* **Oneness:** Just as the pure soul is one and without any dependence on anything else, the paramanu is also one and independent of any other substance.
* **Indivisibility:** Just as the supreme soul, although encompassing countless worlds, is indivisible because it is one and without parts, the paramanu is also indivisible because it is without parts.

**Verse 4:**  The paramanu is also described as having the quality of being the source of form.

* **Source of Form:** The paramanu is the source of form because it is the origin of the tangible form that has touch, taste, smell, and color.

**Thus, the first verse of the second chapter describes the nature of the paramanu.**

## Five Astikayas: The Atom

**219**

**Hin. 0ta. - Uththānika -**  After the explanation of the atom, five verses are mentioned in another place. The first verse states that the atom is eternal and possesses other qualities.

**General Meaning with Anvaya:** (Sabdhesi) All (khandhāṇam) of the skandhas (jo anto) which is the ultimate division (tam) that (paramāṇu) atom (viyāṇ) know (so) it (sassado) is imperishable, (aso) soundless, (ekko) one, (avibhāgī) indivisible, and (muttibhavo) material.

**Explanation:** Just as the Supreme Soul, being the knower, the seer, and of one nature, is imperishable from the standpoint of the substance-theory, and is therefore eternal, so also the atom, due to its inherent nature of being a particle, is eternal. Just as the pure soul, being the object of self-awareness, is not the object of sound or sound-like, even though it is the cause of sound, so also the atom, though the cause of sound in its potential form, is not sound in its actual form, and is therefore soundless. Just as the pure soul, being a substance, is said to be one, without any external attributes, so also the atom, being devoid of any external attributes like particles, etc., is one, or one-located. Just as the Supreme Soul, being a substance, is infinite in its locations, like the space of the universe, yet is indivisible due to its being one, undivided substance, so also the atom, being without parts, is indivisible. Further, the atom, being different from the immaterial Supreme Soul, is material, being born from touch, taste, smell, color, and form. This is the meaning.

**77**

This is the nature of the atom, as stated in the first verse in another place.

**Refutation of the Difference in the Nature of Atoms:**

**Ādesa -** Metta-mutto dhādu- chadukkassa kāraṇam jo du. So o paramāṇū pariṇāma- guṇo say-masaddo. **78**

**Translation:** The one who is the cause of the four elements, being only a modification, is to be known as the atom, a modification-quality, itself soundless. **78**

**Description of the Five Categories of Substance**

The qualities of touch, taste, smell, and color, which are the basis of the materiality of atoms, are differentiated only by designation. In reality, just as the same region is the beginning, middle, and end of an atom, so too, because the substance and its qualities are inseparable in their region, the same region is that of the atom, that of touch, that of taste, that of smell, and that of color. Therefore, if in some atoms the quality of smell is diminished, in some the qualities of smell and taste are diminished, and in some the qualities of smell, taste, and color are diminished, then the atom, inseparable from that quality, would be destroyed. Therefore, the diminution of any quality is not appropriate. Hence, the four elements of earth, water, fire, and air have only one atom as their cause, because the varied quality of the atom, due to its transformation, sometimes assumes a varied outcome through the manifestation or non-manifestation of some quality. Just as it is acknowledged that the qualities of smell, etc., are present in an unmanifest form in the atom due to its transformation, so too, it is not possible to know that sound is also present in an unmanifest form, because there is a contradiction in the unity of a single-region atom with sound, which is multi-regional. || 78 ||

**Commentary:**

This is a refutation of the view that atoms are of different types.

The qualities of touch, taste, smell, and color, which are the basis of materiality, are differentiated from atoms only by designation (i.e., by name). In reality, just as the same region is the beginning, middle, and end of an atom, so too, because the substance and its qualities are inseparable in their region, the same region is that of the atom, that of touch, that of taste, that of smell, and that of color. Therefore, if in some atoms the quality of smell is diminished, in some the qualities of smell and taste are diminished, and in some the qualities of smell, taste, and color are diminished, then the atom, inseparable from that quality, would be destroyed. Therefore, the diminution of any quality is not appropriate. Hence, the four elements of earth, water, fire, and air have only one atom as their cause, because the varied quality of the atom, due to its transformation, sometimes assumes a varied outcome through the manifestation or non-manifestation of some quality.

Just as it is acknowledged that the qualities of smell, etc., are present in an unmanifest form in the atom due to its transformation, so too, it is not possible to know that sound is also present in an unmanifest form, because there is a contradiction in the unity of a single-region atom with sound, which is multi-regional. || 78 ||

**Translation of the Sanskrit Text:**

Therefore, it is established that there are no atoms of different types like earth, etc. The qualities like color, etc., which are the basis of the materiality of atoms, are differentiated only by designation (i.e., by name).

Page #225:
---------------------------
The second verse deals with the refutation of the difference in the types of atoms like earth, etc.

**Translation:**

The five-pointed star, etc., are not differentiated by the region of existence. In reality, the region that is the beginning, middle, and end of the atom is the same as the region of the qualities like form, etc., or is called the form, etc. It is not seen by sight, so it is only a form by inference. The cause of the four elements is the atom, which is known to be the same atom that was mentioned earlier, which transforms into the four elements of earth, etc., over time. The quality of transformation is the quality of transformation, being devoid of the four states of arising, etc. Again, what is special? The meaning of the sutra is that it is itself non-sound, being different from the sound, which is a synonym for the mass of infinite atoms, due to its being one region.

**Explanation:**

The verse explains that atoms are not differentiated by their location or region. The same atom that constitutes the beginning, middle, and end of the atom is also the same as the region of qualities like form, etc. This atom is not seen by sight but is inferred from its qualities. The atom is the cause of the four elements (earth, water, fire, and air) and is the same atom that was mentioned earlier. It transforms into the four elements over time. The quality of transformation is the quality of transformation, being devoid of the four states of arising, etc. The atom is also non-sound, being different from the sound, which is a synonym for the mass of infinite atoms. This is because the atom is one region and is not a collection of many atoms.

## Verse 222

This verse refutes the claim that there are different types of earth, etc., within atoms. It also explains that sound is a synonym for the pudgala skandha.

**Verse 79:**

* **Sound originates from the skandha.**
* **The skandha is an aggregation of atoms.**
* **When these skandhas collide, sound is produced.**
* **This production of sound is constant.**

**Explanation:**

In this world, sound is perceived by the sense of hearing and understood by the mind. It is essentially a synonym for a single skandha composed of infinite atoms. It originates from the skandhas, which are the external causes, because sound is produced when these skandhas collide. 

Furthermore, even though the entire world is filled with infinite, naturally occurring, sound-producing groups of atoms that interpenetrate and permeate everything, sound only manifests when there is an external cause. This means that sound is constantly produced, making it a product of the skandha.

**Anvayaartha (Meaning in order):**

* **Sound originates from the skandha.**
* **The skandha is an aggregation of atoms.**
* **When these skandhas collide,**
* **Sound is produced.**
* **This production is constant.**

**Commentary:**

This verse demonstrates that sound is a synonym for the pudgala skandha.

## Translation:

**Verse 79**

This verse explains that sound is synonymous with the pudgala dravya. It states that sound is a specific type of sound that is perceived by the ear and is characterized by its origin from the skandhas. 

The skandhas are formed by the aggregation of an infinite number of paramanus (atoms). When these skandhas come into contact with each other, sound is produced. This sound is a specific type of sound that arises from the interaction of the skandhas. 

There are two types of skandhas: 

1. **Internal skandhas:** These are subtle and are the fundamental cause of sound. They are constantly present in the world.
2. **External skandhas:** These are gross and are the external causes of sound. Examples include the movement of the tongue and lips, the striking of a bell, the blowing of wind, and the rumbling of clouds. These skandhas are not always present, but only when the necessary conditions are met.

Sound is a specific type of sound that is produced by the interaction of the skandhas. It is not a property of space or a quality of space. If it were a quality of space, it would not be perceived by the ear because space is formless. 

There are two types of sound:

1. **Pragmatic sound:** This is sound that is produced by human beings or other beings.
2. **Vaisrasik sound:** This is sound that is produced by natural phenomena, such as the wind, rain, or thunder.

Sound can also be classified as:

1. **Akshara sound:** This is sound that is made up of letters and is used in languages like Sanskrit and Prakrit.
2. **Anakshara sound:** This is sound that is not made up of letters and includes sounds like the sounds of the senses and divine sounds.

The verse concludes by stating that all of this is to be rejected, and that the true nature of the self is to be embraced. 

**Anvaya:**

Sound is produced from the skandhas. The skandhas are formed by the aggregation of an infinite number of paramanus. When these skandhas come into contact with each other, sound is produced. This sound is a specific type of sound that arises from the interaction of the skandhas.

**General Meaning:**

**Specific Meaning:**

The verse explains that there are two types of skandhas: internal and external. Internal skandhas are subtle and are the fundamental cause of sound. External skandhas are gross and are the external causes of sound. The verse also explains that there are two types of sound: pragmatic and vaisrasik. Pragmatic sound is produced by human beings or other beings, while vaisrasik sound is produced by natural phenomena. The verse concludes by stating that all of this is to be rejected, and that the true nature of the self is to be embraced.

##  224

The six categories of existence and the five types of matter are gross aggregates. They are found in some places in the world, but not everywhere. Where there is a combination of both internal and external matter, there the language-forms transform into words, but not everywhere. These words are produced by language-forms according to rules. Their material cause is language-forms, not the quality of space. If these words were the quality of space, they would not be heard by the ear, because the quality of space should be intangible. Or, from the word "Upyadago" in the verse, it can be understood that this word is "experimental". It is produced by the inspiration of the soul, etc. And the word "Niyado" means that the word is "natural" or inherent, like that which comes from clouds, etc. Or, there are two types of words: language-form and non-language-form. Language-form words are of two types: letter-form and non-letter-form. The Sanskrit, Prakrit, etc. forms, which are the cause of the speech of Aryans and non-Aryans, are letter-form. The words of the two senses, etc., and the divine sound of the liberated Lord are non-letter-form. Now, non-language-form is called, it also has two types: one experimental, the other natural. That which is produced by the use of the soul is experimental, like the sounds of the instruments "Tat", "Vitat", "Ghan", "Sushir", etc. It is said:

"One should know the instruments with strings like Veena, Sitar, etc. as "Tat", the instruments like drums, etc. as "Vitat", the sounds of bells, clocks, etc. as "Ghan", and the instruments like flutes, etc. that are blown as "Sushir". The sounds that are produced due to clouds, etc. are natural or inherent. The meaning is that all these are elements that should be abandoned, and the pure soul-like element should be accepted. ||79||

Thus, the word is a synonym for the pudgala substance. This is mainly established by the third verse.

"Paramanorekapradeshatvakhyapanamet." ||8||

"Nicco Ganavakaso Na Savakaso Padesado Bheda. Khandhanam Pi Ya Kattha Pavihatta Kal-Sankhanam." ||8||

"Nityo Nanavakaso Na Savakaso Pradeshato Bhetta. Skandhanam Api Cha Karta Pravibhakta Kalasankhaya." ||8||

The atom is eternal because it is always imperishable, being endowed with the general qualities of form, etc., in one space. It is non-spacious because it gives space to the qualities of touch, etc., which are indivisible and function in one space.

Page #229:
---------------------------
The atom, due to its single-region nature, is eternal (nitya), not devoid of space (anavakasha), and not spacious (savakasha). It is the divider of the skandhas because it is the cause of their differentiation with a single region. It is the creator of the skandhas because it is the cause of their aggregation with a single region. It is the divider of time because it divides the time-characteristic period with a single region, which transcends a single space region, by its own transformation of motion. It is also the divider of number because it divides the number of substances in the skandhas with a single region, which is preceded by the differentiation of two and so on, it divides the number of areas with a single region, which is preceded by a single space region that is limited by it, it divides the number of times with a single region, which is preceded by time that is limited by the transformation of motion that transcends a single space region, and it divides the number of states with a single region, which is preceded by the knowledge of the states of the subtle color, etc., that are transformed in it.

The description of the six substances and five astikayas (categories) involves measurement in terms of atoms and sub-atoms. This measurement is done using atoms, as sub-atoms are measured in relation to atoms. The unit of measurement for space is 'Akashapradesh' (space region), and its definition involves atoms. Therefore, the measurement of space is also done using atoms. The unit of measurement for time is 'Samaya' (time), and its definition involves atoms. Therefore, the measurement of time is also done using atoms. The unit of measurement for knowledge and emotions is the amount of knowledge required to know the smallest element of color, etc., which is present in an atom. This definition involves atoms. Therefore, the measurement of emotions (knowledge and emotions) is also done using atoms. In this way, atoms are like meters for measuring substances, space, time, and emotions.

One atom region is called 'Akashapradesh' (space region), which is a part of space. This 'Akashapradesh' is the unit of measurement for space. [For counting, the quantity of any object that is considered as one measurement is called the unit of that object.]

**3.** The time taken by an atom to move from one space region to another adjacent space region (at a slow speed) is called 'Samaya' (time).

**Commentary:**

An atom is established as being one region, and it is eternal. Why? Because an atom is always present in one region and never perishes. It is not empty, but it is empty in the sense that it provides space for its own qualities like color, etc. It is not empty in the sense that it is not empty of the second, third, etc., regions. It is the destroyer of the skandhas (aggregates). It is also the creator of the skandhas, like a living being. Just as a living being, due to its attachment to its own region, becomes transformed by the feeling of affection for the form of attachment, etc., and becomes the destroyer of the karmic skandhas, similarly, an atom, due to its attachment to its own region, becomes transformed by the feeling of affection and becomes the destroyer of the skandhas at the time of their disintegration. Just as the same living being, due to its detachment from the true self, becomes transformed by the feeling of affection for the false attachment, etc., in its own region, and becomes the creator of the karmic skandhas like the veil of knowledge, etc., similarly, the same atom, due to its feeling of affection in its own region, becomes the creator of the skandhas like the qualities of the body, etc. Here, the atom that is the destroyer of the skandhas is called the 'karyaparamanu' (effect atom), and the one that is the creator is called the 'karanaparamanu' (cause atom). Thus, there are two types of atoms: effect and cause. As it is said: "The first one is the destroyer of the skandhas, and the second one is the creator of the skandhas."

Alternatively, a second explanation is given regarding the destroyer. This atom is the destroyer. Why? Because it is one region, and it is different from the skandhas, which are many regions. This skandha is the skandha. Why? Because it is many regions, and it is different from the atom, which is one region.

Just like a living being, time and number are divided. Just as a liberated being, with only the knowledge of one region, divides the time of the experience of time and the number of time, similarly, an atom, with one region, divides the time of the experience of time by moving slowly from one atom to another.

Page #231:
---------------------------
The number is said to be the divider of the five astikayas and the infinite numbers. Number is said to be of four types, in the form of the absence of dravya and kshetra. Each of these is of two types, the inferior and the superior. The inferior is in the form of one paramanu, the superior is in the form of infinite paramanus, called dravya-samkhya. The inferior is in the form of one pradesha, the superior is in the form of infinite pradeshas, called kshetra-samkhya. The inferior is in the form of one samaya, the superior is in the form of infinite samayas, called vyavahar-kal-samkhya. The power which is the most inferior of all the powers like colour etc. in the paramanu-dravya, is called the inferior bhava-samkhya. The power which is the most superior of all the powers like colour etc. in the paramanu-dravya, is called the superior bhava-samkhya. Thus, the inferior and superior of each of the dravya, kshetra, kala, and bhava-samkhya should be known. ||80||

Thus, the fourth gatha has been spoken, taking the paramanu-dravya and pradesha as the basis, and the statement of samaya and other vyavahar-kal as the main point, and the statement of the number like one etc. as the secondary point.

**General Meaning with Anvaya:**

This paramanu (niccho) is eternal (padesado) because its being one pradesha never disappears. (naanavakaso) It does not give space to anyone (na savakaso) because it is only one pradesha. (khandhanam vi ya kattha bhettha) It is the creator of the skandhas and the destroyer of them. (kalasamkhanam) It is the divider of the time, samaya, and other numbers.

**Specific Meaning:**

Just as this jiva, by giving up the attachment in the form of raga etc. obtained in its pradeshas, becomes the destroyer or annihilator of the karma-skandhas, so this paramanu, by giving up the smoothness which is fit for bondage in one pradesha, becomes the destroyer of the skandhas by becoming separate from them. And just as the same jiva, by the opposite of the sneha-free paramatma-tattva, becomes the creator of the new karma-skandhas like jnana-avaran etc. by becoming transformed by the smooth feelings in the form of mithyatva, raga etc. obtained in its pradeshas, so this paramanu, by becoming transformed by the smooth quality fit for bondage obtained in its one pradesha, becomes the creator of the skandhas like dvi-anu etc. Here, the paramanu which becomes separate from the skandhas is called the karya-paramanu. And the paramanu which is the creator of the skandhas is called the karana-paramanu. Thus, the paramanu is of two types, due to the difference between karya and karana. As it is said:

The first karya-paramanu is called by the destruction of the skandhas, and the second karana-paramanu is called by the creation of the skandhas. This paramanu, being one pradesha, is different from the skandhas which are of many pradeshas. The skandha is called so because it is multi-pradesha due to the presence of many paramanus in it, so it is different from the one-pradesha paramanu. Just as, staying in one pradesha, only by the part of knowledge...

**228**

Just as the omniscient Lord knows the time-like behavior of the present moment and its infinite number, so too does a single atom, being one-regioned, traverse the next time-atom from the previous one with slow motion, and is capable of distinguishing the subtle time-like behavior of the present moment and its number. Number is of four types: substance, space, time, and emotion, and each of these is further divided into two types: gross and subtle. A single atom is the gross number of substance. An infinite number of atoms together form the subtle number of substance. A single region is the gross number of space. An infinite number of regions together form the subtle number of space. A single moment is the gross number of time-like behavior. An infinite number of moments together form the subtle number of time-like behavior. The subtle power of qualities like color, etc., in an atomic substance is the gross number of emotion. The most subtle power of qualities like color, etc., in the same atomic substance is the subtle number of emotion. In this way, it is important to know the gross and subtle numbers of substance, space, time, and emotion. || 8 ||

In this way, taking a single region of atomic substance as the basis, the statement of time, etc., time-like behavior, is primarily called a single number, and in another place, four verses are spoken.

**Atomic Substance**

This is the description of the permutation of qualities in atomic substance. Know that atom, which is one-flavored, one-colored, one-scented, two-touched, the cause of sound, and soundless, and which has changed its skandha. || 81 ||

Know that atom, which is one-flavored, one-colored, one-scented, two-touched, the cause of sound, and soundless, and which has changed its skandha. || 81 ||

In all atoms, flavor, color, scent, and touch are qualities that coexist. These qualities are in a state of continuous permutation. For example, at any given time, one of the five flavor permutations is present. At any given time, one of the five color permutations is present. At any given time, one of the two scent permutations is present. At any given time, one of the four touch permutations (cold-smooth, cold-rough, hot-smooth, hot-rough) is present. Thus, this atom, due to its nature of being the power of sound skandha transformation, is the cause of sound. Due to its one-regioned nature and the absence of sound permutation transformation, it is soundless. Due to the fact that it has changed its skandha due to the permutation of smooth and rough, it is still one substance, as it does not abandon its nature and has acquired the number due to its inherent nature. || 81 ||

**Anvayaartha (That atom)** That atom [one-flavored, one-colored, one-scented] is one-flavored, one-colored, one-scented, and [two-touched] two-touched, [the cause of sound] the cause of sound, [soundless]

Page #233:
---------------------------
Know that the **Panchaastikaya** (five-fold substance) is **ashब्द** (non-sound) and **(स्कंधांतरितं)** within the **skandha** (aggregate), yet **(द्रव्यं)** definitely a single substance.

**Commentary:** This is a statement about the presence of qualities and their variations in atomic substance.

All atoms have the qualities of taste, color, smell, and touch as inherent properties, and these qualities exist in them along with their respective variations in a sequential manner. It is as follows:

- Out of the five taste variations, one taste exists at a time along with one variation.
- Out of the five color variations, one color exists at a time along with one variation.
- Out of the two smell variations, one smell exists at a time along with one variation.
- Out of the four pairs of touch variations (cold-smooth, cold-rough, hot-smooth, and hot-rough), one pair of touch exists at a time.

Thus, this atom, which is said to have the presence of qualities, is the cause of sound due to its nature as the potential to transform into the form of the sound aggregate. It is **ashब्द** (non-sound) due to its single-location nature and the absence of the activity of transforming into the sound variation. It is within the **skandha** (aggregate) due to its binding nature caused by its smooth-roughness, and yet it is a single substance due to its attainment of individuality (i.e., being counted separately like a complete one) while leaving behind its nature.

**Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas - with Anvaya and General Meaning (Air, Sound, Smell, Two Touches)**

In which there is one taste, one color, one smell, and two touches (Saddakarana) which are the cause of sound (Asai) which is itself devoid of sound (Khandantarit) which is separate from the skandha (Tan Davvam) that is the essence (Paramanu, Paramanu Biyane) we know.

**Specific Meaning:**

In the atom, there is one taste from among the five tastes: pungent, bitter, astringent, sour, and sweet, which exists at one time. One color from among the five colors: white, yellow, red, black, and blue, exists at one time. One smell from among the two types of smells: fragrance and stench, exists at one time. One touch from among the two touches: cold and hot, and one touch from among the two touches: oily and rough, exist at one time. Just as the soul, through its actions, is the cause of sound through the activities of its tongue, lips, etc., but is the object of pure knowledge, being the object of extra-sensory perception, not the object of sound, and is not itself in the form of sound or other pudgala categories, therefore it is devoid of sound. Similarly, the atom, being the cause of sound, is also devoid of sound because it is localized and does not manifest sound. And the atom, which is the essence, is different from the skandha, which is composed of the above-mentioned qualities like color, etc., and categories like sound, etc. Know it to be like the Supreme Soul. Just as the Supreme Soul, in practice, exists within the substance, karma, and the action of karma, but in reality, is only pure consciousness, one in nature, so too the atom, in practice, exists within the skandhas, but in reality, is pure essence, separate from the skandhas. Or, the meaning of "skandantarit" is that it is different from the skandha from the very beginning.

**81**

In this way, the atom is the essence, and its qualities like color, etc., are its nature, and from it arise categories like sound, etc. Thus, the fifth verse is complete. In another place, five verses are spoken about the essence of the atom.

**Conclusion of the Variations of All Pudgala**

**82**

**Uva Bhojja - Mind, Senses, Body, and Karma**

Whatever is tangible, other than the senses, body, mind, and karma, know that all is pudgala.

**82**

Page #235:
---------------------------
The five sense objects, touch, taste, smell, color, and sound, are the middle sense organs. The sense organs are touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing. The bodies are the noble, the subtle, the food, the luminous, and the karmic. The substance-mind, the substance-karma, and the non-karma are the infinite, infinite-atom-groups, infinite-innumerable-atom-groups, infinite-numerable-atom-groups, extending to the bow-shoulder, and the atoms. Whatever else is material, all that should be understood as a variety of pudgala. || 82 ||
- Thus ends the explanation of the pudgala-substance-body.
Anvaya-artha (Indriyah upbhogyam cha) The object of enjoyment by the senses, [Indriyakayah] the sense body, (Man) mind (Karmani) karma (cha) (anyat yat) whatever else (murta bhavati) is material (tat sarvam) all that (pudgalam janiyat) know as pudgala.
Tika - This is the conclusion of all the varieties of pudgala.
Touch, taste, smell, color, and sound (five) sense objects, touch, taste, breath, sight, and hearing (five) substance-senses, noble, subtle, food, luminous, and karmic (five) bodies, substance-mind, substance-karma, non-karma, the infinite, infinite-atom-groups, infinite-innumerable-atom-groups, and infinite-numerable-atom-groups extending to the two-atom-shoulder, and the atoms, and whatever else is material, all that should be understood as a variety of pudgala.
Thus ends the explanation of the pudgala-substance-body.
San.ta. - Now, let us summarize all the varieties of pudgala. The object of enjoyment by the senses - The object of enjoyment of those beings who are free from attachment, who have no taste for sensual pleasures, is the form of the five sense objects. The sense bodies are the opposite of the non-sensory nature of the non-sensory self. The five bodies, called the noble, the subtle, the food, the luminous, and the karmic, are the opposite of the non-body nature of the non-body self. The mind is the opposite of the pure being-body, which is free from the network of mental constructs. The eight karmas are the opposite of the substance-self, which is free from karmic actions. Whatever is material, which is the opposite of the immortal nature of the immortal self, is the form of infinite-innumerable-infinite-atom-groups, the form of an infinite-divisible-atom-mass. All that, and everything else, such as non-karma, etc., is pudgala. Thus ends the summary of the pudgala-substance. || 82 ||
Thus, in the form of a summary of the pudgala-body, one verse has been included in the third place. Thus ends the fifth chapter, called the pudgala-body, in the first great chapter, which deals with the six substances, the five bodies, and the ten verses. || Him.ta. - Uththānika - Further, summarizing all the varieties of pudgala, they say - Anvaya-sahita samanyārtha - (Indiehiṁ uvbhojjam) The object of enjoyment by the senses (ya)

Page #236:
---------------------------
Know all of this as **pudgala** dravya: the six substances, the five astikayas, the five senses (**indriya**), the five types of bodies (**kaya**), the mind (**mano**), the eight karmas (**kammani**), and anything else that is a material substance (**murtika padartha**).

**Special Meaning:**  Know as **pudgala** the five sense objects that are enjoyed by those beings who do not have the taste of the **vitaraaga** (free from attachment) and **ati-indriya** (beyond the senses) bliss, the five senses that are opposite to the **ati-indriya** (beyond the senses) self-nature, the five bodies (**audarika**, **vaikriyika**, **aaharaka**, **taijas**, and **karman**), which are opposite to the bodiless self-substance, the mind that is different from the pure **jiva-astikaya** (soul-body) devoid of mental fluctuations, the eight karmas (**jnana-avaran** etc.) that are contrary to the karma-free self-substance, and anything else that is a material substance (**murtika**), such as the **skandha** (aggregate) of countable, uncountable, and infinite **pudgala** atoms, which are opposite to the immaterial self-nature. || 82 ||

Thus, in the third **sthala** (stage), one **gatha** (verse) was spoken, contracting the **pudgala-astikaya**. In this way, the fifth **antar-adhikāra** (inner chapter) named **pudgala-astikaya** ended in the first **maha-adhikāra** (great chapter) in ten **gatha** (verses), which are the proponents of the six substances and the five **astikayas**.

## The Nature of Dharma-astikaaya

This is a description of the nature of Dharma-astikaaya.

Dharma-astikaaya is without taste, color, smell, sound, or touch. It pervades all realms, is unbreakable, vast, and encompasses countless regions.

**Commentary:**

Dharma-astikaaya is inherently formless due to the complete absence of touch, taste, smell, and color. Therefore, it is also soundless. It pervades all realms and space, making it all-encompassing. It is unbreakable because it is composed of countless, inseparable regions. It is vast because it is inherently expansive in all directions. Although it is a single, unbroken entity in its essence, it is considered to encompass countless regions in practical terms.

**Further Explanation:**

This section discusses the nature of Dharma-astikaaya and Adharma-astikaaya. The seven verses in this section focus on these two concepts. The first three verses primarily describe the nature of Dharma-astikaaya, beginning with the phrase "Dhamm-atthikaaya-marasam." The following verse, starting with "Jah havaddi," focuses on the nature of Adharma-astikaaya. The final three verses, beginning with "Jado alog," discuss the merits and demerits of both Dharma-astikaaya and Adharma-astikaaya, emphasizing their existence and non-existence. These seven verses collectively explain the nature of Dharma-astikaaya and Adharma-astikaaya, providing a comprehensive understanding of these concepts.

**In summary:**

The first verse describes Dharma-astikaaya as being devoid of taste, color, smell, sound, and touch. It is all-encompassing, unbreakable, vast, and encompasses countless regions. The commentary further elaborates on these characteristics, explaining the inherent formlessness, soundlessness, pervasiveness, unbreakable nature, and vastness of Dharma-astikaaya.

Page #238:
---------------------------
## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

**In the regions of transformed living beings, the Dharma-astikaya is like the supreme bliss, the taste of nectar, the perfect harmony, and the pervading presence of the Siddhas in the Siddha-kshetra, like water in a full pot, or like oil in sesame seeds. It is continuous, without any gaps between regions, and it is not scattered like a group of meditating monks in a deserted forest or like a crowd of people in a city. It is vast and boundless like the sky in the regions of the Abhyavi-jiva, and it is not limited like the regions of the Kevali-jiva, which are like the expanse of cloth or other objects.  **

**Furthermore, what is its special characteristic? The Sutra states that it is a single, undivided region, but due to its nature, it is considered to be as vast as the number of regions in the Lokakasha, as indicated by the term "Asankhya" (innumerable).**

Page #239:
---------------------------
The five-fold substance is pervasive in the world, like clothes and other things that expand and contract. It is not expanding now, but it has been pervasive from the beginning of time and will continue to be so for an infinite time. It is a group of infinite substances, but according to the principle of good conduct, it is the measure of the space of the world. This is the meaning of the sutra. ||83|| This is a description of the remaining nature of Dharma.
Always, by the infinite, heavy and light, it is transformed. It is the cause of the motion and action of the substances, and it is itself without action. ||84||
The Dharma is always transformed by the infinite, heavy and light qualities, which are the basis of its nature, and which are constantly changing in the six places. It is constantly being created and destroyed, but it does not change its nature, so it is eternal. It is the cause of the motion and action of the substances, because it is the only support that is not separate from them. It is itself without action, because it is only the existence of itself. ||84||
Another meaning: (By the infinite, heavy and light) it (the Dharma substance) is always transformed by the infinite, heavy and light (qualities, parts), it is eternal. It is the cause of the motion and action of the substances, and it is itself without action.
Commentary: This is a statement of the remaining nature of Dharma.
Again, Dharma [Dharma substance] is transformed by the heavy and light qualities, that is, the nature of the heavy and light, which is the basis of its nature, and which is constantly changing in the six places. It is constantly being created and destroyed, but it does not change its nature, so it is eternal. It is the cause of the motion and action of the substances, because it is the only support that is not separate from them. It is itself without action, because it is only the existence of itself. ||84||

---------------------------
The description of the six substances and the five astikayas is as follows:

The Lord, the Siddha, though indifferent, is a contributing cause for the attainment of Siddhahood by the worthy beings who are absorbed in the qualities of the Siddhas. Similarly, Dharma, though indifferent by nature, is a contributing cause for the movement of the living beings and pudgalas who are undergoing transformation.

First, it is not an effect, just as the Siddha is not an effect, because he is not created by anyone else, but is self-existent. Similarly, Dharma is not an effect because it is self-existent. This is the meaning.

The remaining nature of the Dharma substance is as follows:

It is constantly changing due to the infinite, subtle and gross qualities. It is imperishable and is the cause of the movement of the living beings and pudgalas who are associated with the action of movement. It is not an effect in itself.

**Special Meaning:**

Due to the nature of the substance, there are subtle and gross qualities. These constantly change through the infinite, indivisible, and limited divisions of the six locations, which are the states of existence, growth, and decay. Through the perspective of the Paryayaarthika Nay, this Dharma substance is subject to production and destruction, but through the perspective of the Dravyarthika Nay, it is eternal.

Just as the Lord, the Siddha, is indifferent, but is a contributing cause for the attainment of Siddhahood by the worthy beings who are absorbed in the qualities of the Siddhas, similarly, this Dharma substance is indifferent to the living beings and pudgalas who are moving, but is a contributing cause for their movement.

Just as the Lord, the Siddha, is created by his own pure existence and is not created by anyone else, therefore he is not an effect, similarly, the Dharma substance is also created by its own existence and is not created by anyone else, therefore it is not an effect. This is the meaning.

**Example:**

Just as water is a contributing cause for the movement of fish in the world, similarly, know that the Dharma substance is a contributing cause for the movement of living beings and pudgalas.

Just as water, though not moving itself, is a contributing cause for the movement of fish who are moving themselves, similarly, Dharma, though not moving itself, is a contributing cause for the movement of living beings and pudgalas who are moving themselves.

Page #241:
---------------------------
**Verse 237**

**Anvaya:** Just as water in the world is helpful for the movement of fish, in the same way, know that Dharma-dravya is helpful for the movement of jivas and pudgalas.

**Tika:** This is an illustration of Dharma being the cause of motion.

Just as water, not moving itself and not causing others to move, is a mere supportive cause, being indifferent and inseparable, for the movement of fish that move on their own, in the same way, Dharma (Dharma-astikaya) also, not moving itself and not causing others to move, is a mere supportive cause, being indifferent and inseparable, for the movement of jivas and pudgalas that move on their own. ||85||

**Samskrita Tika:** Now, the author presents a well-known illustration of Dharma being the cause of motion: Just as water in the world is helpful for the movement of fish, in the same way, know that Dharma-dravya is helpful for the movement of jivas and pudgalas, O disciple. For example, just as water, not moving itself and not impelling the fish, is a supportive cause for the movement of those fish that move on their own, in the same way, Dharma, not moving itself and not impelling others, is a supportive cause for the movement of jivas and pudgalas that move on their own. Or, for the movement of the liberated souls. For example, just as the pure, self-realized, doubt-free Dharma, free from the defects of attachment, etc., is the material cause for the liberation of the blessed ones, in the same way, the Dharma in the form of merit, characterized by the excellent accumulation of the nature of Tirthankaras, obtained through the cessation of causes, is also a supportive cause. Similarly, although jivas and pudgalas have their own material cause for their movement, Dharma-astikaya is also a supportive cause. Or, for the movement of the blessed and the unblessed ones: Just as, during the time of movement in the four states of existence, although the internal good and bad karmic results are the material cause, external good practices like giving, worship, etc., and external auspicious observances are also supportive causes, in the same way, although jivas and pudgalas have their own internal strength through their own conviction, Dharma-astikaya is also a cause of movement in practice. This is the meaning. ||85||

Thus, the first three verses have primarily explained Dharma-astikaya.

Page #242:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**238**

While discussing the six substances and the five categories of matter, the movement of the soul and the pudgalas becomes a cooperative cause. This is similar to how punya is a cooperative cause in the attainment of the Siddha state by the liberated souls. Although the knowledge of the true self, free from passions and with pure self-experience, is the substantial cause for the liberated souls to attain the Siddha state, the karma of the Tirthankara nature, bound by the results without a cause, and the special punya in the form of the karma of superior endurance, etc., or the auspicious dharma, is the cooperative cause. 

Similarly, although the inner auspicious or inauspicious result is the substantial cause for the movement of the four states for both the liberated and the non-liberated souls, the act of wearing the symbols of the substance, etc., and giving donations, performing worship, etc., or other external auspicious rituals are the external cooperative causes. 

In the same way, although the soul and the pudgalas have their own inherent power within them, the dharma-astikaya is the cooperative cause for their movement in practice. This is the meaning. || 85 ||

In this way, three verses were spoken primarily about the explanation of the dharma-astikaya in the first section. This is the explanation of the nature of adharma.

**86**

Just as there is dharma-dravya, so know that there is also a substance called adharma. It is the cause for those who are engaged in the activity of staying, like the earth. || 86 ||

Just as dharma has been explained, so too should adharma be explained. However, there is a difference. It (dharma-astikaya) is the cause for those who are engaged in the activity of movement, like water. This one, however, is the cause for those who are engaged in the activity of staying, like the earth. Just as the earth itself stands firm and establishes others, and is only a supporting cause for the staying of horses, etc., so too adharma itself stands firm and establishes others, and is only a supporting cause for the staying of the soul and the pudgalas. || 86 ||

**Meaning:** Just as there is dharma-dravya, so too know that there is also a substance called adharma. However, it is the cause for those who are engaged in the activity of staying, like the earth.

**Commentary:** This is the statement of the nature of adharma.

Just as dharma has been explained, so too should adharma be explained. However, there is a difference. It (dharma-astikaya) is the cause for those who are engaged in the activity of movement, like water. This one, however, is the cause for those who are engaged in the activity of staying, like the earth. Just as the earth itself stands firm and establishes others, and is only a supporting cause for the staying of horses, etc., so too adharma itself stands firm and establishes others, and is only a supporting cause for the staying of the soul and the pudgalas. || 86 ||

Page #243:
---------------------------
The five-fold astikaya is the cause of 239 types of karma, and this (adharma-astikaya) is the cause of the earth's stability for those who are engaged in karmic activity. Just as the earth, being itself stable and not causing the stability of others, is a mere supporting cause, indifferent and inseparable, for the stability of horses and other beings that are naturally stable, so too [adharma-astikaya], being itself stable and not causing the stability of others, is a mere supporting cause, indifferent and inseparable, for the stability of those who are naturally stable. || 86 ||

Page #244:
---------------------------
The knowledge of the six substances and the five astikayas is described. According to the vyavahar nay, the reason for this is the remembrance of the qualities of the five supreme beings, such as aham, siddha, etc. Similarly, according to the nischya nay, the nature of the jivas and pudgalas is the material cause for their existence. This is the meaning of the sutra, "Adharma is a substance." ||86||

In this way, the explanation of the adharma substance ends in the second part of the gatha sutra. This is a discussion of the cause of the harmony of dharma and adharma. Just as the movement and rest of the alog and log are due to their nature, so too are the two divided and undivided, and the world and the non-world. ||87||

The movement and rest of the alog and log are due to the harmony of the two. ||8|| The two are both divided and undivided, and they are also the measure of the world. ||8|| Dharma and adharma exist because the division of the world and the non-world cannot be otherwise. The world is the existence of all substances, including jivas, etc., in one place. The non-world is the existence of pure space. There, jivas and pudgalas obtain their movement and rest from their own nature. If dharma and adharma were not the external causes of the movement and rest of jivas and pudgalas, which they themselves experience, then their movement and rest would be without any cause, and they would also exist in the non-world. Then the division of the world and the non-world would not be established. Therefore, the harmony of dharma and adharma is accepted as the external cause of the movement and rest of jivas and pudgalas. ||87||

Commentary: This shows the reason for the establishment of the harmony of dharma and adharma.

Dharma and adharma exist because the division of the world and the non-world cannot be otherwise. The world is the existence of all substances, including jivas, etc., in one place. The non-world is the existence of pure space. There, jivas and pudgalas obtain their movement and rest from their own nature. If dharma and adharma were not the external causes of the movement and rest of jivas and pudgalas, which they themselves experience, then their movement and rest would be without any cause, and they would also exist in the non-world. Then the division of the world and the non-world would not be established. Therefore, the harmony of dharma and adharma is accepted as the external cause of the movement and rest of jivas and pudgalas. ||87||

Anvayaartha: (Gamanasthiti) (Jiva-pudgalaki) movement and rest (cha) and (alokalokam) the division of the alog and log (yayoh sadbhavatas) due to the harmony of those two substances (jatam) happens. (Cha) and (dvaun api) these two (vibhaktou) divided, (avibhaktou) undivided (cha) and (lokamaatraun) the measure of the world (matoun) are said.

Commentary: This shows the reason for the establishment of the harmony of dharma and adharma.

Page #245:
---------------------------
**From the five astikayas and onwards,**

**241. By what can one be saved from (nothing can save one from it), therefore the division of the world and the non-world will not be proven, but if the movement of the jiva and pudgala and their stationary state are accepted as the external causes of dharma and adharma, then the division of the world and the non-world (is proven). (Therefore dharma and adharma exist.) Dharma and adharma are both distinct from each other due to their separate existence, and are inseparable due to their being in the same field, and they influence the jivas and pudgalas in the entire world in their movement and stationary state in a passive way, therefore they are proof of the world.**

**Commentary:**

**The text shows the reason for the existence of dharma and adharma. What is the cause? The world and the non-world. From what is it born? From the possibility of dharma and adharma, which are naturally inherent. Not only the world and the non-world are born, but also the movement and stationary state of the jivas and pudgalas. How are they? Both dharma and adharma are accepted as two distinct entities, or according to another reading, "amya" (not created by anyone). They are distinct due to their separate existence, and inseparable due to their being in the same field, and they are proof of the world and the non-world.**

**Explanation:**

**The world is a collection of six substances, and the non-world is the pure space outside of it. The existence of the world and the non-world proves the existence of dharma and adharma. If there were no external causes of dharma and adharma in the movement and stationary state of the jivas and pudgalas in the world, then how would movement be prohibited in the outer part of the world? Nothing can prohibit it, therefore the division of the world and the non-world proves the existence of dharma and adharma. What are their characteristics? They are distinct due to their separate existence, and inseparable due to their being in the same field. They are always passive and pervading the entire world, therefore they are proof of the world.**

Page #246:
---------------------------
## 242
## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

Who can prohibit? If there were no one to prohibit, then there would be no division of the world and the non-world. But when there is a world and a non-world, then it is known that Dharma and Adharma are definitely substances. Their existence is distinct, they are certainly connected. Both are immersed in the same field, just as the Siddha-Rashi is inseparable from the field in which it resides, so are they inseparable. Both are always inactive and, being all-pervasive, are limited to the world - this is the meaning of the sutra. ||87||

This explains the complete indifference of Dharma and Adharma, even though they are the cause of motion and rest.

The Nay (principle) moves, Dharma does not move, it does not move another substance.

The spread of motion is for the Jivas and the Puggalas. ||88||

Just as the wind, which is the result of motion, is seen to be the cause of the motion of flags, so Dharma is not. Because it is inactive, it never becomes the result of motion. How then can it be the cause of the motion of others by being a co-worker? But just as water is only a supporting cause for fish, so is Dharma indifferent to the spread of motion for Jivas and Puggalas.

And just as a horse, which is the result of motion and previous rest, is seen to be the cause of the rest of the chariot, so Adharma is not. Because it is inactive, it never becomes the result of motion and previous rest. How then can it be the cause of the rest of others? But just as the earth is only a supporting cause for the horse, so is Adharma indifferent to the spread of motion and previous rest for Jivas and Puggalas. ||88||

Meaning of the Anvaya: (Dharma-Astika) Dharma-Astika (na gachchati) does not move (cha) and (anyadravya-sya) does not cause the movement of another substance, (sa) he (jiva-na-m puggala-na-m) (of the Jivas and Puggalas) (gateh prasara) is the spreader of motion (bhavati) becomes.

Commentary: Here it is stated that Dharma and Adharma are completely indifferent, even though they are the cause of motion and rest.

Just as the wind, which is the result of motion, is seen to be the cause of the motion of flags, so Dharma is not. Because it is inactive, it never becomes the result of motion, so how can it be the cause of the motion of others by being a co-worker? (It cannot be.) But just as water is only a supporting cause for fish (in motion), so is Dharma indifferent to the spread of motion for Jivas and Puggalas.

Page #247:
---------------------------
The **Pancastikaya** is the propagator of the **Udasina** motion, just as the **Dharma** is the propagator of the **Udasina** motion of the **Jiva** and **Pudgala** (in the **Gatiparinam**), only as a supporting cause.

And (in relation to **Adharmaastikaya** also, it is like this that) just as a horse, whose **Gati** is **Purvakasthitiparinat**, appears to be the cause of the **Sthitiparinam** of the rider (**Patipurvak**), so **Adharma** is not. It (**Adharma**) being truly inactive, never attains **Gatipurvakasthitiparinam**, so how can it be the cause of the **Gatipurvakasthitiparinam** of others by being co-existent? (It cannot be) But just as the earth is the propagator of the **Udasina** motion of the **Gatipurvakasthiti** only as a supporting cause for the horse (in **Gatipurvakasthitiparinam**), in the same way, **Adharma** is the propagator of the **Udasina** motion of the **Gatipurvakasthiti** only as a supporting cause for the **Jiva-Pudgala** in **Purvakapasadharana**. || 88 ||

##  Translation:

**244**

The description of the six-fold *astikaya* and the five-fold *astikaya* has been given. In the same way, the *dharma* substance, being self-established, moves due to its own inherent cause, and becomes an external cause for the movement of the *jiva* and *pudgala* without any motivation. Although the *dharma-astikaya* is indifferent, it is a cause for the movement of the *jiva* and *pudgala*. Just as water is indifferent, yet it is helpful in the movement of fish due to their own inherent force. Just as the earth is helpful for the horses that are self-established, and the shade is helpful for the travelers, in the same way, the *adharma-astikaya* is self-established, yet it is an external cause for the state of the *jiva* and *pudgala* due to its own inherent cause. This is the opinion of Bhagwan Shri Kundakunda Acharya Dev. || 88 ||

This is a discussion about the indifference of *dharma* and *adharma* as causes. Those who have movement, their state of being is also possible. They make movement and state of being through their own transformations. || 89 ||

*Dharma* never acts as a cause for the movement of *jiva* and *pudgala*, and *adharma* never acts as a cause for their state of being. If they were the main causes (motivating causes) for the movement and state of being of others, then those who have movement should only have movement and not state of being, and those who have state of being should only have state of being and not movement. But since we see both movement and state of being in the same entity, it can be inferred that they are not the main causes. However, they are indifferent as established by the practical approach. How then do the entities that have movement and state of being have movement and state of being? All entities that have movement and state of being definitely make movement and state of being through their own transformations. || 89 ||

Thus ends the explanation of the *dharma* and *adharma* substances and their *astikaya*.

**Anvaya-artha:** (Those who have movement) those who have movement (their state of being is also possible) then they have state of being [and those who have state of being, they have movement]. (They) those (entities that have movement and state of being) then (through their own transformations) through their own transformations (make movement and state of being) make movement and state of being.

**Tika:** This is said regarding the indifference of *dharma* and *adharma* as causes.

In reality, *dharma* never acts as a cause for the movement of *jiva* and *pudgala*, and *adharma* never acts as a cause for their state of being. Because if they were the main causes (motivating causes) for the movement and state of being of others, then those who have movement should only have movement and not state of being, and those who have state of being should only have state of being and not movement. But the same entity (the same entity) has both movement and state of being.

Page #249:
---------------------------
The five Astikayas are seen in 245 ways, therefore it can be inferred that they [Dharma-Adharma] are not the main causes of motion and rest, but are established by practical means! (established-said by practical means) indifferent cause
Question- If this is the case, how do the substances that are in motion and rest come to be in motion and rest?
Answer- In reality, all substances that are in motion and rest are definitely in motion and rest due to their own transformations. ||89||

**246**

The description of the six substances and the five aggregates is presented, but it is observed that those who move are the ones who stay, or those who are stationary are the ones who move. This proves that dharma and adharma are not the primary causes. If they are not the primary causes, then how do the jivas and the karmic particles move and stay? Therefore, it is said that they move or stay by their own inherent powers of transformation. Here, the intention is that the unchanging, blissful, and luminous nature, which is the essence of the Supreme Soul, is the object of attainment. These dharma and adharma substances are different from that pure soul essence, therefore they are the objects of renunciation. || 89 ||

In this way, the establishment of dharma and adharma substances is primarily mentioned in the third section, in the three verses. In these seven verses, through the three sections, the sixth chapter, which explains dharma and adharma, is completed in the middle of the first great chapter, which deals with the five aggregates and the six substances.

**The nature of the space substance is explained as follows:**

"All jivas, all other substances, and all karmic particles, whatever gives space to all, that is called space in the world." || 90 ||

In the world, which is made up of six substances, the pure space, which is the cause of all space for all other substances, is called space. || 9 ||

Now, the explanation of the space substance is given.

**Explanation:**

(In the world) in the world, (of jivas) of jivas, (and) and [of karmic particles] of karmic particles, (as well) in the same way, (of all other substances) of all other substances, (whatever) that which (gives all space) gives all space, (that) that [is space] is space.

**Commentary:**

This is the statement of the nature of space. In the world, which is made up of the earth substance, the space that is the cause of all space for all other substances is space, which is the pure space. || 10 ||

**Summary:**

After the pure soul aggregate, which is the cause of liberation, the nature of pure consciousness and the object of attainment, the space aggregate is explained in seven verses. In these seven verses, first, the nature of the world and space is explained in the verse beginning with "All jivas..." Then, the question is raised, "What is the purpose of dharma and adharma if space itself will cause movement and stillness?" This is the main point of the four verses beginning with "Space is perceived..." Then, the fact that dharma, adharma, the world, and space are all one field is explained...

**Pancastikaya Prabhruta**

247

The main point of the sutra "Dhamma Dhamma Agasa" etc. is that due to the pervasiveness and equal measure of the five categories, they are one in terms of non-real existence, but due to their distinct characteristics, they are different in terms of certainty. Thus, the seven gathas explain the nature of the Akasa Stikaya in three places.

**Explanation:**

The nature of Akasa is described as follows:

"It encompasses all beings, all souls, all other things, all Dharmas, Adharmas, and Kalas, and all Pudgalas. It is the space that gives space. It is the void, the gap, the opening, the expanse, the whole, the entire, the aforementioned, the world. It is the Akasa."

**Question:**

Here, Shiva Kumar Maharaj asks, "O Bhagavan! This world is of immeasurable extent. In this world, there are countless beings, each with infinite qualities, and there are also infinite Pudgalas, Dharmas, Adharmas, and Kalas. How do they all find space in this Akasa?"

**Answer:**

The Bhagavan replies, "Just as many lamps illuminate a single room, just as many gold coins are contained in a single bag, just as many things are kept in a single house, and just as many sounds are heard from a single bell, so too, in this world of immeasurable extent, countless beings find space due to the unique quality of pervasiveness." || 10 ||

**Hindi Translation:**

**Uththānikā:**

After this, the pure and enlightened soul is the pure Jiva Stikaya, which is the cause of liberation and is capable of receiving everything. The Akasa Stikaya, which is different from it, is described in seven gathas. Among these seven gathas, the first two describe the nature of both Lokakasa and Alokakasa, starting with the gatha "Savvesim Jivaṇam" etc. Further, Akasa itself will be both in motion and at rest. What is the need for Dharma and Adharma substances? To refute this prior objection, the next four gathas are in the order of "Agasam Avagasam" etc. Then, Dharma, Adharma, and Lokakasa are considered as one field of pervasiveness, and being of equal measure, they are one in terms of non-real existence, but due to their distinct characteristics, they are different in terms of certainty. This is stated in the sutra "Dhamma Dhamma Agasa" etc. In this way, the seven gathas explain the nature of the Akasa Stikaya in three places.

**Hindi Translation:**

**Now, the nature of Akasa is described:**

**Anvayasahita Samanyarthah:**

(Savvesim) All (Jivaṇam) beings (tay ya) and (Poggalāṇam) Pudgalas (cha) and (Sesāṇam) the rest, Dharma, Adharma, and Kala (jan) which (vivaram) space (dedi) gives (tan) that (akhilam) entire (ayasam) Akasa (loe) in this world (havdi) is.

**Vishesharth:**

Here, Shiva Kumar Maharaj said, "O Bhagavan! This world is immeasurable...

Description of the Six Substances - Five Astikayas
It is in the region. In this world, there are infinite and infinite living beings who are eternally free from karma-born knowledge and are characterized by supreme bliss. They are even more infinite in their qualities. How do all these, with their different measures of space in the world-space, find space in this world-space? Bhagwan Kundkund Maharaj answers: Just as the light of many lamps finds space in one room, and a lot of gold in a single piece of fragrant betel nut, and a pot full of honey in a pot full of camel's milk, and the sound of victory and the sound of a bell, etc., find space in a cellar due to the special quality of penetration, so too, countless beings, etc., can find space in countless regional worlds. || 90 ||

**Indication of Space Outside the World**

Living beings, matter, body, dharma, and adharma are not different from the world. Space, which is without end, is different from and not different from the world. || 91 ||

Living beings, etc., are not different from the world because they are limited in size, while space, because it is infinite, is different from and not different from the world. || 91 ||

**Anvayaartha** [Living beings, matter-body, dharma, adharma, and time] are not different from the world. Space, which is without end, is different from and not different from the world.

**Commentary**

1- This is an indication of space outside the world.

The remaining substances (other than space) are limited in size and are therefore not different from the world. Space, however, is infinite and is therefore different from and not different from the world. || 91 ||

**San. Ta.** - Now, the text reveals that the world is a combination of the six substances, and that there is infinite space outside it. Living beings, matter-body, dharma, adharma, and time are all included in the world. How are they all included? They are not different from the world. Space, which is different from and not different from the world-space, is infinite. What is the proof of this? It is without end. Although the text generally states that these substances are not different from the world, it is certain that living beings are different from the other substances due to their characteristics of being formless, having only knowledge, being naturally endowed with supreme bliss, being eternal, and being free from impurities. The other substances are also different from living beings due to their own characteristics. Therefore, it is understood that there is no possibility of mixing or interference. || 11 ||

Thus, the first two verses have established the nature of the world and space outside the world.

Page #253:
---------------------------
## Pancastikaya Prabhrit 249

**Hindi Ta. - Uththānika -** Further it is said that the aggregate of six substances is the Lok (world), beyond that is the infinite Akash (space) which is Alok (non-world).

**Anvaya Saha Samanyarth -** (Jiva) Infinite Jivas (Poggalakaya) infinite Pul Skandha and Anu (Dhamma Dhamma) Dharma Adharma dravya (Y) and innumerable Kal dravya (Logdo) are not outside this Lok (world). (Tatto) That which is not separate from this Lok Akash (Annyaan) is the remaining (Annan) Akash (Ayasam) which is infinite and devoid of any (Antavadirittam).

**Vishesharth -** In this Sutra, the oneness of substances with Lok Akash is stated in general, however, it is certain that all Jivas who are formless, possess only knowledge, are naturally blissful, eternal and free from the stain of Karma, are different from the remaining substances due to their characteristics. Similarly, the remaining substances are also different from Jivas due to their own characteristics. Therefore, it is known that even though they reside in the same space, there is no mixing or interference, meaning no substance merges with another to become one, nor does any substance disperse to become many. || 99 ||

In this way, supporting the nature of both Lok Akash and Alok Akash, two verses were spoken in the first section.

**Akashya Avakashaikaheto Gartisthitihetuthvashankayaam Doshopannyaso'yam**

**Aagasam Avagasam Gaman-Hidi- Karanehim Deddi Jadi.**
**Uddum Gadi - Ppradhana Siddha Chitthati Kidh Tatth.** || 92 ||

**Aakasham Avakasham Gamanasthitikaranaabhyam Dadati Yadi.**
**Urdhvagatipradhanaah Siddhaah Tishtanti Katham Tatra.** || 92 ||

**Yadi Khalvaakasham Avagahiinam Avagahahetu Gartisthitimatam Gartisthitiheturap Syaat, Tada Sarvotkrushtasvabhaavikordhvagatiparinata Bhagavantah Siddhaah Bahirangantarangasaadhanasaamagryaam Satyaam Api Kutastatraakashe Tishtati Iti.** || 92 ||

**Anvayarth -** [Yadi Aakasham] If Akash (Gamanasthitikaranaabhyam) gives space with the cause of motion and rest [Avakasham Dadati] (meaning if Akash is both the cause of space and the cause of motion and rest), then (Urdhvagatipradhanaah Siddhaah) the Siddhas who are primarily of upward motion (Tatrah) in that (Akash) (Katham) why [Tishtanti] remain stationary? (Why don't they move further?)

Page #254:
---------------------------
250
**Commentary on the Five-fold Nature of Substance** - If someone claims that space is the cause of motionlessness, and doubts that space is also the cause of motion, then there is a flaw in their argument.

If space, in the same way that it is the cause of the movement of those who move, is also the cause of the motionlessness of those who are motionless, then why (for what reason) would the perfected, liberated beings, who are naturally inclined to move upwards, remain stationary in space, even though they have the external and internal means and materials? ||92||

**Commentary** - Here, it is shown that if space provides space for beings like jivas, and if it also provides for motion and stillness, then there is a flaw. The question is, if space is the cause, then why would it provide for both? How can it be the cause of both movement and stillness?

**Explanation** - The perfected beings, who are characterized by pure consciousness and the absence of change, have destroyed the paths of hell, animal, human, and god, and have attained the state of liberation through the power of their understanding of the essence of time and cause. They naturally move upwards. Why do they remain stationary in the space at the top of the world?

**Meaning** - This sutra implies that space is not the cause of stillness. The perfected beings do not move beyond the world because there is no dharma substance beyond the world. Dharma substance is the cause of movement. ||12||

This is an explanation of the position of stillness. The Jina sages have stated that the perfected beings reside above. Therefore, space is not the cause of stillness, but rather the cause of movement. ||93||

Page #255:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

**Verse 93:**

**From the five-pointed star and above, the position of the Siddhas has been declared by the Jinas. Therefore, know that there is no place of movement in the sky.**

**Commentary:**

This is a statement regarding the position of the Siddhas. Since the Siddha Bhagavants, having moved, reside above the world, it is certain that the cause of movement and position is not in the sky. It is to be understood that Dharma and Adharma, which divide the world and the non-world, are the causes of movement and position.

**Explanation:**

This verse explains that the Siddhas, who are beyond the realm of the world, do not move or reside in the sky. Their movement and position are determined by Dharma and Adharma, which are the principles that govern the universe. 

**Note:** The term "five-pointed star" refers to the five-pointed star symbol that represents the Jain cosmology.

##  252
**Explanation of the six substances and five astikayas**

This is an explanation of the reason why space is not the cause of motion and rest. If space were the cause of motion and the reason for their location, then the destruction of the non-living world and the expansion of the living world would follow. 

**94**
If space were the cause of motion and the reason for their location, then the destruction of the non-living world and the expansion of the living world would follow. Space is not the cause of motion and rest because the arrangement of the boundaries of the living and non-living worlds can be explained in this way. If space were considered the cause of motion and rest, then because space exists everywhere, the motion and rest of living beings and pudgalas would be limitless, and the non-living world would be destroyed every moment. The boundary of the living world, which was previously established, would be broken by the continuous expansion of the living world. Therefore, space is not the cause of motion and rest. 

**Explanation of the text:**

[If] If (space) space (of them) living beings and pudgalas (cause of motion) is the cause of motion and [reason for their location] the cause of rest (is) then (destruction of the non-living world) the destruction of the non-living world (and) and (expansion of the living world) the expansion of the living world (would follow) would follow.

**Commentary:**

Here, the reason for the absence of space being the cause of motion and rest is presented. Space is not the cause of motion and rest because the arrangement of the boundaries of the living and non-living worlds can be explained in this way. If space were considered the cause of motion and rest, then because space exists everywhere, the motion and rest of living beings and pudgalas would be limitless, and the non-living world would be destroyed every moment. The boundary of the living world, which was previously established, would be broken by the continuous expansion of the living world. Therefore, space is not the cause of motion and rest. 

**94**

_Commentary:_

Now, in order to prove that space is not the cause of motion and rest, another reason is given: "If it were to be..." What is it? "Cause of motion" - the cause of motion. What? "Space" - space, not only the cause of motion? "Reason for their location" - the cause of rest. Of whom? "Them" - those living beings and pudgalas. Then what would be the fault? "Would follow" - would follow. What is it? "Destruction of the non-living world" - the destruction of the non-living world, not only the destruction of the non-living world, but also "expansion of the living world" - the expansion of the living world. For example, if space were the cause of motion and rest, then because space exists even outside the living world, there would also be motion of living beings and pudgalas there, and therefore there would be destruction of the non-living world and expansion of the living world. But that is not the case, therefore, from this reason, it is known that space is not the cause of motion and rest. This is the meaning.

Page #257:
---------------------------
##  Pancastikaya Prabhrut 253

**Hindi Ta-Uththānika:** Further, there are more reasons to prove that space does not have the power to cause motion and rest.

**Anvaya Saha Samanyarth:** If space were the cause of motion and rest for the living beings and karmic particles, then the destruction of non-loka space would occur, and the boundary of loka space would expand.

**Vishesharth:** If space were the cause of motion and rest, then space would exist even outside loka space. In that case, the living beings and karmic particles would move even in infinite space. This would lead to the non-existence of non-loka space and the expansion of the boundary of loka space. But this is not the case. Therefore, it is proven that space is not the cause of motion and rest. || 94 ||

**Akasha-sya Gati-Sthiti-Hetutva-Niraasa-Vyakhya-Upasamharo'yam, Tahma Dhamma-Dhamma Gaman-Tthidi-Karanaani Naagasam. Idi Jinavarehi Bhanidam Log-Sahavaam Sunataanam. || 95 ||**

**Tasmaad Dharma-Adharmau Gaman-Sthiti-Karane Naakasham. Iti Jinavaraaih Bhanitam Lokasvabhavam Shrunvataam. || 95 || Dharma-Adharmaaveva Gati-Sthiti-Karane Naakashamiti. || 95 ||**

**Anvayaarth:** Therefore, dharma and adharma are the causes of motion and rest, not space. This is what the Jinas have said to those who listen to the nature of the world.

**Teeka:** This is the conclusion of the statement refuting the claim that space is the cause of motion and rest. Dharma and adharma are the causes of motion and rest, not space. || 95 ||

**San. Ta.:** Now, the conclusion of the explanation refuting space as the cause of motion and rest is stated. Therefore, dharma and adharma are the causes of motion and rest, not space. This is what the Jinas have said. To whom does this apply? To those who are worthy. What are they doing? They are listening to the nature of the world while seeking refuge. This is the meaning. || 15 ||

**Hindi Ta-Uththānika:** Thus, the four verses in the second section have gone by, stating that dharma and adharma are the causes of motion and rest, not space.

**Hindi Ta-Uththānika:** Further, this explanation is summarized by saying that space is not the cause of motion and rest.

Page #258:
---------------------------
##  Chapter 254: Description of the Six Substances and Five Bodies - Including Other Matters

**General Meaning:**  [Tahhmaa] Due to this reason, [Dhamma-Dhamma] Dharma and Adharma are the contributing causes for [Gaman-Vidika-Karanani] movement and rest. [Aagasam Na] Space is not a cause. [Idi] This is what [Sunantanam] the noble ones who listen to the nature of the world in the Samavasarana, [Jinavarehin] the Jina Devata, [Bhanidan] have said. ||95||

In this way, Dharma and Adharma are the causes for movement and rest, not space. Saying this, the four verses in the other section are complete. Although Dharma, Adharma, and space are one in terms of their comprehension, they are different in reality. This is stated here:

Dharma, Adharma, and space are not separate, they are of equal measure. They are different due to their distinct qualities, thus making them one and different. ||96||

Dharma, Adharma, and space are of equal measure and are only together due to their shared space. In reality, they are different due to their distinct qualities, which are: (1) their function in movement, rest, and comprehension, and (2) their distinct regions as determined by knowledge. ||96||

**Explanation of the Body of Space:**

**Meaning of the Verse:** (Dharma, Adharma, and space) Dharma, Adharma, and space (loka-akasha) are (of equal measure) of equal measure. Due to their (not being separate) non-separateness and (distinct qualities) distinct qualities, they (make them one and different) create oneness and difference.

**Commentary:** Here, it is stated that although Dharma, Adharma, and space are one in terms of their comprehension, they are different in reality.

Dharma, Adharma, and space are one only due to their shared space (only due to their shared space in terms of comprehension). In reality, they are different due to (1) their function in movement, rest, and comprehension (distinct qualities) and (2) their distinct regions as determined by knowledge (distinct qualities). ||96||

**Translation of the Sanskrit Text:**

Now, the text shows that Dharma, Adharma, and space are one in terms of their shared space, but different in terms of knowledge. Dharma, Adharma, and space are substances. What are their specific qualities? They are not separate and are of equal measure in terms of their function. What is their nature? They are different due to their distinct qualities.

Page #259:
---------------------------
The five Astikayas, beginning with the Ākāśa Astikaya, are distinguished by their unique characteristics. What do these characteristics do? They create oneness in practice and difference in certainty. For example, just as this living being, along with the five substances like Pudgala, creates oneness in practice by being contained within the same field as other living beings, it creates difference in certainty by its knowledge quality, which is characterized by the ultimate consciousness and its playful nature, illuminating an infinite number of qualities simultaneously in all things. Similarly, the substances of Dharma, Adharma, Loka, and Ākāśa, being contained within the same field, are indistinguishable and have the same magnitude, so they create oneness in practice through their shared characteristics. However, they create difference in certainty by their unique characteristics of motion, rest, and containment. This is the meaning of the sūtra. || 96 ||

Thus, the Gāthā Sūtra has been explained in the third place, describing the oneness and difference of Dharma, Adharma, and Ākāśa.

In this way, the seventh Uttara Adhikāra, which explains the Ākāśa Astikaya in three places through seven Gāthās, is complete within the first Mahādhikāra, which discusses the five Astikayas and the six substances.

Page #260:
---------------------------
## Chapter 256: Description of the Five Astikayas and Six Dravyas, and a Chulika

Here, the corporeal and incorporeal nature, and the conscious and unconscious nature of the Dravyas are described.

**Verse 97:**

* **Akasha, Kala, Jiva, Dharma, and Adharma are incorporeal.**
* **Pudgala Dravya is corporeal.**
* **Jiva is truly conscious among them.**

**Explanation:**

* **Corporeal** is that which has the nature of possessing touch, taste, smell, and color.
* **Incorporeal** is that which has the nature of lacking touch, taste, smell, and color.
* **Conscious** is that which has the nature of possessing consciousness.
* **Unconscious** is that which has the nature of lacking consciousness.

Therefore:

* **Akasha** is incorporeal.
* **Kala** is incorporeal.
* **Jiva** is incorporeal in its own form, but can become corporeal through association with corporeal Dravyas.
* **Dharma** is incorporeal.
* **Adharma** is incorporeal.
* **Pudgala** is the only corporeal Dravya.

* **Akasha** is unconscious.
* **Kala** is unconscious.
* **Dharma** is unconscious.
* **Adharma** is unconscious.
* **Pudgala** is unconscious.
* **Jiva** is the only conscious Dravya.

**Anvayaartha (Meaning of the words in order):**

* **Akasha, Kala, Jiva:** Akasha, Kala, Jiva
* **Dharma, Adharma:** Dharma and Adharma
* **Murti Parihina:** are incorporeal
* **Pudgala Dravya Murta:** Pudgala Dravya is corporeal
* **Teshu:** among them
* **Jiva:** Jiva
* **Khalu:** truly
* **Chetana:** conscious

**Commentary:**

Here, the corporeal and incorporeal nature, and the conscious and unconscious nature of the Dravyas are described.

**Translation of the Sanskrit Commentary:**

After this, the commentary on the Chulika describing the Five Astikayas and Six Dravyas continues until the eighth verse. Within the eight verses, the verse beginning with "Aayas" primarily describes the conscious and unconscious, corporeal and incorporeal nature. The verse beginning with "Jiva Poggalakaya" primarily describes the active and inactive nature. The verse beginning with "Je Khalu Indiyagejja" describes the corporeal and incorporeal nature in another way. The two verses beginning with "Kalo Parinam Bhavo" primarily describe the two types of time: the time of experience, which is the time of the transformation of Jiva, Pudgala, etc., and the time of certainty, which is the time that is the cause of the transformation and is in accordance with the time of experience. The verse beginning with "Ede Kalagas" primarily describes the nature of the Dravyas, the fact that they are not bodies because they lack the second and subsequent parts. The two verses beginning with "Evam Pavayan Saram" describe the result of contemplation, which is the path to liberation, which is the nature of the pure Jiva, which is the form of Kevala Jnana Darshan, which is part of the Five Astikayas, during the time of the transformation of the Vitaraga Nirvikalpa Samadhi. Thus, these eight verses describe the six stages of the path.

Page #261:
---------------------------
The **Panchaastikaya** (five categories of existence) and the **six dravyas** (substances) are explained in the next eight gathas (verses). The main theme of these eight gathas is **cetana** (consciousness) and **acetana** (non-consciousness), **murta** (concrete) and **amurta** (abstract). The gathas like "Aayaasa" etc. focus on **active** and **inactive** aspects. The gathas like "Jeeva Moggalakaya" etc. focus on the **characteristics of amurta**. The gathas like "Je Khalu Indiyagejja" etc. explain the **nine stages of existence** (nav jirn paryay). The **time of action** (vyavahar kal) is the **state of existence** and the **time of certainty** (nishchay kal) is the **cause of change** (parinati) in the **existence of jiva, pudgala** etc. The gathas like "Kalo Parinambhavo" etc. explain both types of time. The **characteristics of dravya** are possible in this time. It has **dravya** (substance) because it is possible. It is **akaya** (non-body) because it does not have second or other regions. The gathas like "Ede Kalaagasa" etc. explain this. The **pure jiva** (soul) with **kevalgyan** (perfect knowledge) and **kevaldarshan** (perfect vision) is present within the five categories of existence. When it transforms into **vitrag nirvikalp samadhi** (state of complete detachment and equanimity), it becomes the **path of liberation** (nishchay moksha marg). The gathas like "Evam Pavayan Saar" etc. explain the **fruits of this path of liberation**. In this way, the eight gathas explain the **community** (samudaya) through the **six realms** (sthal).

Now, the **concrete and abstract nature of dravyas** and the **conscious and non-conscious nature of dravyas** are explained.

**General meaning:** (Aagasa, Kala, Jeeva) **Aakash** (space), **Kala** (time), **Jeeva** (soul), (Dhamma, Adhamma) **Dharma** (merit) and **Adharma** (demerit), (Muttiparihina) **amurta** (abstract) without form, (Ghoggal Davvam) **Pudgala dravya** (matter) is **murta** (concrete). (Tesu) In these six, (Khalu) definitely (Jeevo) **Jeeva dravya** (soul) is **cetana** (conscious).

**Specific meaning:** That which has **touch, taste, smell, and color** is called **murta** (concrete). That which does not have these qualities is called **amurta** (abstract). There are five **amurta** dravyas except **pudgala**. Although **jeeva** is definitely **amurta** (abstract) due to its **indivisible and single appearance** (akhand ek pratibhas may), it is also **murta** (concrete) in practice due to the **association** (samsarg) with **karma** (action) acquired by the **jeeva** which is **devoid of raga** (attachment) etc. and has the **inherent nature of bliss** (sahaja anand) and is **devoid of the realization of the true nature of the soul** (atma tattva bhavana). **Pudgala dravya** is **murta** (concrete) due to its **touch, taste, smell, and color**. **Jeeva** is **cetana** (conscious) due to its **infinite consciousness** (ananta chaitanya) which is **free from doubt** (sanshaya) etc. and has the **capacity to perceive itself and others** (swarapar parichchitti samarth). The others are **acetana** (non-conscious) due to the **absence of self-illuminating consciousness** (swarapar prakashka chaitanya). This is the meaning.

## Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

A living being who accumulates karmic matter due to a life devoid of the realization of the soul's true nature, which is pure bliss, is called a *mūrtika* due to its association with such karmic matter. This living being is truly a *kṣetra* (field) because it is capable of knowing itself and others without any doubt or uncertainty, and it possesses the infinite potential of *chaitanya* (consciousness). The other five substances are devoid of this self-illuminating quality of *chaitanya*, and therefore they are all *achetan* (non-conscious). This is the meaning. || 97 ||

Thus, the *Gāthā Sūtra* concludes by primarily expounding on the nature of *chetana* (conscious) and *achetan* (non-conscious), *mūrta* (material) and *amūrta* (immaterial).

Here, the active and inactive nature is explained:

Living beings, along with *puḍgala* (matter), are active, but not the rest.
Living beings are *puḍgala* karana (those who have *puḍgala* as their external instrument of action), and *skandha* (aggregates) are *kāla* karana (those who have time as their external instrument of action). || 98 ||

**Explanation:**

* **Action** is the synonym for the *pariṣpanda* (vibration) that is the cause of attaining a different location.
* Living beings are active when they are associated with an external instrument of action, and so are *puḍgala*.
* *Ākāśa* (space), *dharma* (merit), *adharma* (demerit), and *kāla* (time) are inactive.
* The external instrument of action for the activity of living beings is *karma* (action), which is in the form of accumulated *puḍgala* (matter). Therefore, they are *puḍgala* karana.
* Due to the absence of *karma*, *siddhās* (liberated souls) are inactive.
* The external instrument of action for the activity of *puḍgala* is *kāla* (time), which brings about change.
* *Kāla* (time) does not have an absence like *karma* does. Therefore, *puḍgala* is not inactive like *siddhās*. || 98 ||

**Anvaya-ārtha (Meaning of the Text):**

(Living beings, along with *puḍgala* bodies) are active when associated with an external instrument of action, but not the rest of the substances. Living beings are *puḍgala* karana (those who have *puḍgala* as their external instrument of action), and *skandha* (aggregates) are *kāla* karana (those who have time as their external instrument of action).

**Tīkā (Commentary):**

Here, the active and inactive nature of the substances is explained.

* **Action** is the synonym for the *pariṣpanda* (vibration) that is the cause of attaining a different location.
* Living beings are active when they are associated with an external instrument of action, and so are *puḍgala*.
* *Ākāśa* (space), *dharma* (merit), *adharma* (demerit), and *kāla* (time) are inactive.
* The external instrument of action for the activity of living beings is *karma* (action), which is in the form of accumulated *puḍgala* (matter). Therefore, they are *puḍgala* karana.

---------------------------
The five Astikayas are the source of amrita (nectar). Their absence is the reason for the inactivity of the Siddhas. The external means of activating the pudgalas is the result-producing time, therefore the pudgalas are time-conditioned.

Just as karma and other things do not have an absence, similarly, the pudgalas do not have inactivity like the Siddhas. ||98||

**Commentary:**

Here, the active and inactive nature of the substances is explained. The jivas (souls) are active along with the pudgalakaya (body of pudgalas). How? Along with (saha). What is the meaning of saha? Along with external cooperating causes. The remaining four substances are not active along with the jivas and pudgalas. The external cause of the activity of the jivas is explained. The jivas are pudgalakarna (caused by pudgalas) - they have acquired karma and non-karma pudgalas due to their actions of mind, speech, and body, which are the result of their experience of pure self-awareness, and their deviation from that experience. These are the cause, reason, and reason for their activity.

Here, the word skandha (aggregate) refers to two types of pudgalas: skandha (aggregate) and skandhanu (atomic). What are they like? Active. By what? By the time-conditioning (kalakarna) - the time-substance that is the cause of change. It is clear that just as the Siddhas become inactive due to the absence of karma and non-karma pudgalas when karma is destroyed by the power of pure self-awareness, so it is not the case with the pudgalas. Why? Because time is always present, being formless and devoid of color, etc. This is the meaning.

Thus, the main point of the active and inactive nature is explained in the verse.

**Hindi Translation:**

**Uttanika:** Further, the active and inactive nature of the substances is explained.

**General Meaning with Anvaya:** (Jiva) The jiva (soul) and (pudgalakaya) the pudgalakaya, these two substances (saha) become active (sakriya) due to the presence of external causes (havanti). (Sesa) The remaining four substances (na ya) are not active. (Jiva) The jiva (soul) becomes active due to the help of (pudgalakarna) the pudgalas and (khanda) the skandha (aggregate) of the pudgalas (khalu) actually due to the (kalakarna du) time-substance.

**Specific Meaning:** The jivas, due to their experience of pure self-awareness, have accumulated karma and non-karma pudgalas through their actions of mind, speech, and body. These are the cause of the activity of the jivas. The skandha (aggregate) and skandhanu (atomic) of the pudgalas are the two types of pudgalas, and the external cause of their change is the time-substance. They become active due to it. Here, the meaning is that the jivas, who become Siddhas by destroying karma through the power of pure self-awareness and by being devoid of all karma and non-karma pudgalas, become inactive. This does not happen with the pudgalas, because time, which is formless and devoid of color, etc., is always present. Due to it, the pudgalas continue to be active as much as possible. ||98||

Thus, the verse ends with the main point of active and inactive nature.

## Dravy - Description of the Five Astikayas
## This is the explanation of the characteristics of the Murta and Amurta. 

**1**
Those objects that are perceived by the senses of living beings are called Murta. 
The rest, which is the mind, is Amurta. The mind perceives both. || 99 ||

**1**
Here, living beings perceive objects with their senses of touch, taste, smell, and sight, which are the objects of these senses, and have the nature of touch, taste, smell, and color. Through the sense of hearing, the same objects are perceived as transformed into sound and form, which are the causes of the object of the sense of hearing. Sometimes these objects are gross, sometimes subtle, and sometimes atomic. Because of their ability to be perceived by the senses, whether they are perceived or not, they are called Murta. 

The rest, all other objects, which have the nature of the absence of touch, taste, smell, and color, are called Amurta because they are not capable of being perceived by the senses. 

Both of these (Murta and Amurta) are capable of being perceived by the mind. The mind, which is not limited to any particular object, is not capable of being attained, and is the means of knowledge, perception, and belief, perceives both Murta and Amurta. || 99 ||

- Thus ends the Chulika.

**Anvayaartha:** (Ye khul) Those objects (jivaiḥ indriyagrāhyāḥ viṣayāḥ) that are perceived by the senses of living beings (te mūrtāḥ bhavanti) are Murta, and [śeṣa] the rest of the objects (amūrta bhavati) are Amurta. (Cittaṃ) The mind (man) (ubhayaṃ) perceives both of them [Murta and Amurta] (samādadāti) (knows them).

**Tīkā:** This is the explanation of the characteristics of Murta and Amurta.

In this world, living beings perceive objects with their senses of touch, taste, smell, and sight, which are the objects of these senses, and have the nature of touch, taste, smell, and color. Through the sense of hearing, the same objects are perceived as transformed into sound and form, which are the causes of the object of the sense of hearing. (These objects), sometimes are gross, sometimes subtle, and sometimes atomic. Because of their ability to be perceived by the senses, whether they are perceived or not, they are called Murta.

The rest, all other objects, which have the nature of the absence of touch, taste, smell, and color, are called Amurta because they are not capable of being perceived by the senses.

Both of these (the aforementioned two types, i.e., Murta and Amurta objects) are capable of being perceived by the mind (man). The mind, which is not limited to any particular object, is not capable of being attained, and is the means of knowledge, perception, and belief, perceives both Murta and Amurta. || 99 ||

**Pancastikaya Prabhrut**

**261 Saṅkhya Taṅka -**  Now, in another way, the nature of the **mūrta** (concrete) and **amūrta** (abstract) is explained. Those things which are the objects of the senses, which are the instruments of knowledge, are **karma-tāpa-patra** (karmic impressions). By whom are they made? By the **jīvas** (souls) - those who are outward-looking, who are intoxicated by the pleasure of objects, and who are devoid of the **nirvikalpa** (unconditioned) bliss of the Self. These become **mūrta** (concrete) because they are beyond the nature of objects, and are contrary to the true nature of the Self. Some of them, though they are not objects of the senses in the present time, due to their subtle nature, will become objects of the senses in the future. Therefore, they are called **indriya-grahaṇa-yogya** (capable of being perceived by the senses).

The rest, **amūrta** (abstract), are those which are not objects of the senses, such as the **ātma-dravya** (soul-substance) which is the basis of **ati-indriya-jñāna** (super-sensory knowledge) and **sukha** (bliss), and the other five **dravya** (substances) besides **pudgala** (matter).

**Citta** (mind) embraces both - **citta** embraces both the **mūrta** and the **amūrta**. **Citta** is the cause of **mati-jñāna** (intellectual knowledge) and **śruta-jñāna** (scriptural knowledge), and its object is not fixed. Of these, that which is **ātma-grāhaka** (perceiver of the Self) in the form of **bhāva-śruta** (intuitive knowledge) is **pratyakṣa** (direct knowledge), and that which is known as **aṣṭāṅga-caturdaśa-pūrva-rūpa-paramāgama** (the twelve angas, fourteen pūrva-rūpas, and the ultimate scriptures) is **parokṣa** (indirect knowledge) in the form of **vyāpti-jñāna** (knowledge of pervasiveness), though it is similar to **kevala-jñāna** (omniscience).

Thus it is said: "**Su-kevalaṁ ca ṇāṇaṁ doṣiṇavi sarisāṇi hoti bohādo. Su-ṇāṇaṁ ca parokkhaṁ paccakkhaṁ kevalaṁ ṇāṇaṁ**" (True omniscience is like a mirror to the faults. True knowledge is both indirect and direct, and is omniscience).

Thus, the **gāthā** (verse) explaining the nature of the **mūrta** and **amūrta** is complete. 

**Hindi Taṅka -**  **Uttānīkā -**  Further, the nature of the **mūrta** and **amūrta** is explained in another way.

**Anvaya-sahita-sāmānya-ārtha -**  (Jīvahiṁ) By the **jīvas** (souls), (khalu) certainly, (je viṣaya) those objects, (indriya-gejžhā) which are capable of being perceived by the senses, (huṁti) are, (te mūrta) they are **mūrta** (concrete). (Seṣa) The rest, all the five **dravya** (substances) including the **jīvas**, (amūrtaṁ) are **amūrta** (abstract). (Cittaṁ) Mind, (ubhayaṁ) both, (samādiyati) embraces.

**Višeṣa-ārtha -**  Those **jīvas** who are delighted in the pleasure of objects, and who are outside the taste of the nectar of bliss, which is **vītarāga** (devoid of attachment) and **nirvikalpa** (unconditioned), those who perceive the objects of the senses, they are **mūrta** (concrete). Those objects of the senses are devoid of objects, and are contrary to the true nature of the Self, which is the nature of blissful Self-awareness. Some of these **pudgala** (matter) **mūrta** (concrete) **dravya** (substances) are so subtle that they are not perceived by the senses in the present time, but in the future, when they become capable of being perceived by the senses, they will become objects of the senses. The **amūrta** (abstract) are those which are not objects of the senses, such as the **ātma-dravya** (soul-substance) which is the basis of **ati-indriya-jñāna** (super-sensory knowledge) and **sukha** (bliss), and the other five **dravya** (substances) besides **pudgala** (matter). **Citta** (mind) embraces both the **mūrta** and the **amūrta**.

This **citta** is the cause of **mati-jñāna** (intellectual knowledge) and **śruta-jñāna** (scriptural knowledge). Its object is not fixed. Of these, that which is **ātma-grāhaka** (perceiver of the Self) in the form of **bhāva-śruta** (intuitive knowledge) is **pratyakṣa** (direct knowledge), and that which is known as **aṣṭāṅga-caturdaśa-pūrva-rūpa-paramāgama** (the twelve angas, fourteen pūrva-rūpas, and the ultimate scriptures) is **parokṣa** (indirect knowledge) in the form of **vyāpti-jñāna** (knowledge of pervasiveness), though it is similar to **kevala-jñāna** (omniscience).

**9.**  The expectation of knowledge about the description of the six substances and the five astikayas is the same for both Shruta Jnana and Kevala Jnana, but Shruta Jnana is indirect, while Kevala Jnana is direct.

**10.**  Thus, the verse ends by describing the nature of the concrete and abstract in a different way. This is a description of the nature of Vyavahar Kala (practical time) and Nishchay Kala (absolute time). Kala (time) is born from Parinam (change), and Parinam is born from Dravya Kala (substance-time). The nature of both is that Kala is momentary and constant.

**100.**  Kala is born from Parinam, and Parinam is born from Dravya Kala.

**10.**  The nature of both is that Kala is momentary and constant.

**Commentary:** This is a statement about the nature of Vyavahar Kala and Nishchay Kala.

There, the sequential Paryaya (aspect) called "Samaya" is Vyavahar Kala, and the Dravya (substance) that is its basis is Nishchay Kala.

There, Vyavahar Kala is a Paryaya of Nishchay Kala, but it is known to be measured by the Parinam of Jiva-Pudgalas (living beings and particles), therefore it is called "born from the Parinam of Jiva-Pudgalas". And the Parinam of Jiva-Pudgalas is born in the presence of Dravya Kala, which is the external cause, therefore it is called "born from Dravya Kala".

The meaning here is that Vyavahar Kala is determined by the Parinam of Jiva-Pudgalas, and Nishchay Kala is determined by the impossibility of the Parinam of Jiva-Pudgalas being otherwise (i.e., the Parinam of Jiva-Pudgalas cannot be formed in any other way).

The momentary Vyavahar Kala is due to the subtle Paryaya being only as long as it lasts, and the eternal Nishchay Kala is due to its being the Dravya that is the basis of its own Guna Paryaya (aspect of qualities), and therefore being imperishable forever.

**263. There, the transactional time is momentary, because it is only as much as a subtle modification (as much as the time itself), the definitive time is eternal, because it is always indestructible in its form as the fundamental substance of its quality modifications.** ||100||

**Commentary:**

Here, the nature of transactional time and definitive time is established. Time, in the form of moments, minutes, hours, days, etc., is transactional time. How is it? It is born of modification - the slow movement of atoms, the blinking of the eyelids, the movement of the hand holding a water vessel, the movement of the sun, etc. This is the nature of the modification in the form of the quality modification of the pudgala substance. Because it is manifested by it, it is revealed, therefore, in transactions, it is considered to be born of the pudgala modification. But in reality, the modification of the definitive time is in the form of the kalaanu substance. The modification, born of the substance time - the aforementioned pudgala modification, starting from the movement of atoms, etc., is born from the kalaanu substance, which is the cause of the lower stone and the outer ring in the rotation of the potter's wheel, like the fire for the reader in the winter. Therefore, it is born of the substance time. This is the nature of both the definitive and transactional time. What is the nature of transactional time? It is born of modification, because it is manifested by the pudgala modification. Definitive time, however, is the cause of modification. Time is momentary - transactional time in the form of time is momentary, but definitive time is eternal - because it is always indestructible due to its being the basis of its own quality modifications. Here, although a being who has attained liberation through the three jewels of distinction, non-distinction, and the jewel of knowledge, attains the ultimate happiness, which is the goal to be achieved, by being free from attachment, etc., and being eternally blissful, the being is not the cause of it, but time is not the cause. Thus, it is said: "The self is the cause of its own attainment," etc. ||100||

Page #268:
---------------------------
##  Chapter 264: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikayas

The term "Kalaki" is a synonym for the definitive (**niścaya**) time. The transformation of pudgala, such as a student using fire for warmth in winter, or the lower stone supporting the potter's wheel, is caused by the external, cooperative cause, which is the time-like substance (**dravya-kāla**). Therefore, transformation is said to be caused by **dravya-kāla**. 

**Vyavahāra-kāla** arises from the transformation of pudgalas, and is therefore a product of transformation. **Niścaya-kāla** is the cause of transformation, and is therefore the generator of transformation. 

**Vyavahāra-kāla**, which is time in the practical sense, is fleeting like a moment, while **niścaya-kāla**, which is the definitive time, is eternal, being the basis of its own qualities and synonyms. 

The implication here is that although a living being, due to the influence of **kāla-labdhi** (the attainment of time), attains the path to liberation, which is the three jewels of distinction and non-distinction (**bheda** and **abheda**), or the three jewels of practical and definitive (**vyavahāra** and **niścaya**), and becomes capable of attaining the ultimate happiness, which is free from attachment and other passions, and is eternal and blissful, and of a single nature, the cause of this attainment is the living being, not time. As it is said: "Liberation is achieved by the living being itself as the cause." (10)

This explains the division of time into eternal and momentary. Time is said to be eternal, as it is the basis of possibility. It is born, decays, and is both short and long. (101)

The term "time" refers to the eternal, which is the form of existence. It is born, decays, and is both short and long. (101)

The particular substance that is always referred to as "this is time, this is time" is eternal, as it indicates its own existence. However, that which is born and decays is a synonym of time, which is a particular substance. Although it is fleeting like a moment, it is considered to be long-lasting due to the power of logic, which shows its continuous existence. Therefore, the practical use of time, such as the analogy of a sand-glass, an ocean, etc., is not contradicted. 

Therefore, **niścaya-kāla** is eternal, as it is a substance, while **vyavahāra-kāla** is momentary, as it is a synonym. (101)

**Explanation of the meaning:** The term "time" is a representation of existence, and therefore **niścaya-kāla** is eternal. **Vyavahāra-kāla**, on the other hand, is born and decays, and is also long-lasting (in terms of its flow).

**Commentary:** This statement describes the two divisions of time: eternal and momentary. The particular substance that is always referred to as "this is time, this is time" is eternal, as it indicates its own existence.

Page #269:
---------------------------
The **Pancastikaya Prakrut** (265) states that the **Nischya Kala** (true time) is eternal, manifesting its true nature, while the **Vyavahara Kala** (practical time) is a synonym for a particular substance, which is destroyed as soon as it is born. Although it is fleeting, it shows its lineage (flow), so there is no fault in calling it "long-lasting" by the force of **naya** (logic). Therefore, **Aavlika**, **Palyopama**, **Sagaropama**, etc., are not prohibited as practical time.

Thus, it is said here that **Nischya Kala** is eternal because it is a substance, while **Vyavahara Kala** is momentary because it is a synonym.

Page #270:
---------------------------
## Chapter 266: Description of the Six Substances and Five Astikaayas

Although it is not eternal in the sense of two aksharas, it is eternal because it is worthy of being called by the word "time." It is important to know this as the definitive time.  Practical time is born and destroyed in relation to the present moment, it is perishable moment by moment, yet it is also considered to be long-lasting in the sense of a lineage of past and future times, like the ocean of moments, etc. There is no fault in this. In this way, it is important to know that definitive time is eternal, and practical time is impermanent.

Or, in another way, the nature of definitive and practical time is described as follows: That which is beginningless and infinite, devoid of any conception or distinction of time, etc., is formless and intangible, and exists in the sky as the substance of time, that is definitive time. The same substance of time, in its synonym, is the subtle synonym of time, and in relation to the collection of times, it is called practical time, which is any assumed distinction of time, like a blink, an hour, etc. || 101 ||

Thus, the thoughts of the auspicious beings who are well-established in their own unchanging bliss, are merely the wonders of consciousness, for them, the external cause is the attainment of time. That same time is of two types: definitive and practical. Its description is mainly given in two verses in the fourth chapter.

This is the establishment of the substance-hood and non-substance-hood of time.

These time, space, dharma, adharma, and living beings, obtain the designation of substance, but time does not have substance-hood. || 102 ||

Just as living beings, pudgala, dharma, adharma, and space, are all designated as substances due to their possession of all the characteristics of substances, so is time. Thus, there are six substances. But just as living beings, pudgala, dharma, adharma, and space, have the characteristic of being located in a specific place, and thus have substance-hood, time does not have substance-hood because it is located in one place, namely space. Therefore, time is not primarily discussed in the chapter on the five astikaayas. It is included here because it is a synonym of the transformation of living beings and pudgala, and because its substance-hood is inferred from the impossibility of its transformation otherwise. || 102 ||

Thus ends the explanation of the substance of time.

Meaning of the words: [These] this (time, space) time, space (dharma, adharma) dharma, adharma (living beings)

Page #271:
---------------------------
The five astikayas, beginning with the pudgala, and the jivas (all) obtain the designation 'dravya'. However, time does not have the designation 'kaya'.

Commentary: This is a statement about the establishment of time as a dravya and the denial of its being an astikaya. Just as jiva, pudgala, dharma, adharma, and akasha obtain the designation 'dravya' because they possess all the characteristics of a dravya, similarly, time also obtains the designation 'dravya' (because it possesses all the characteristics of a dravya). Thus, there are six dravyas. However, just as jiva, pudgala, dharma, adharma, and akasha have the designation 'astikaya' because they have the characteristic of entering into two or more places, time does not have the designation 'astikaya' because its kalanas (units of time) are one-place-only, even though their number is equal to the number of regions in the lokakasha. For this very reason, time is not mentioned primarily in the chapter on the five astikayas. However, it is included here because it is a dravya, as it is known through the transformations of jivas and pudgalas, and because its existence is inferred from the impossibility of the transformations of jivas and pudgalas without it. Thus, the explanation of time is complete.

Page #272:
---------------------------
## Six Substances - Description of Five Astikayas

**Special Meaning:** The characteristics of a substance are three, as stated in the introductory lecture, namely: that which always exists, that which undergoes production, decay, and transformation, and that which is the bearer of qualities and modifications. All six possess these three characteristics, hence they are six substances. Among these, time is not an Astikaya, because it does not possess the characteristics of the five Astikayas, such as the pure knowledge, perception, nature, and pure Jiva Astikaya, which are present in the undivided aggregate form of space. As it is said:

**268** Just as a heap of jewels, while occupying all space, holds different jewels, so too, the time atoms are present in all space, one by one, in each region. However, they never meet each other. These time atoms are countless substances. The number of time atoms is equal to the number of regions in space, which is countless. Here, the implication is that except for the pure Jiva substance, which includes pure knowledge, etc., pure qualities, and pure modifications like omniscience, non-duality, lightness, etc., the remaining five substances are to be abandoned. **102**

In this way, time does not possess the characteristics of an Astikaya, but it is a substance. This is explained in the five sections of the Sutra.

**Result of Understanding:** This is the conclusion of the explanation of the five Astikayas.

**103** Thus, having understood the essence of the teachings and the collection of the five Astikayas, whoever abandons attachment and aversion, he attains liberation from suffering.

**103** Indeed, nothing else is taught in the entire discourse except the five Astikayas, which are related to time. Therefore, this collection of the five Astikayas is the essence of the teachings. Whoever understands this meaning, which encompasses the essence of all reality, and recognizes his own self, which is within the Jiva Astikaya, as being eternally pure and luminous in nature, and observes the modifications of his own nature, which are caused by the continuous chain of karma, attachment, aversion, and their consequences, and experiences them as his own, and whose light of discrimination, kindled by this understanding, extinguishes the chain of karma, the consequences of attachment and aversion, he, like an atom that is attracted to the qualities of pure love and repelled from future bondage, falls away from past bondage, and, like a drop of water heated to a boil, attains liberation from suffering.

**Meaning of the Sentence:** [Thus] in this way, [the essence of the teachings] the essence of the teachings, [the collection of the five Astikayas] the collection of the five Astikayas...

Tīkā—Here, the fruit of understanding Pancastikaya is said, concluding the explanation of Pancastikaya!
In reality, nothing else is expounded besides Pancastikaya, including the entire discourse time, therefore, the essence of the discourse is this 'Pancastikayasangraha'. The man who, knowing this 'Pancastikayasangraha', which speaks of the entire truth, in essence (according to the meaning, in the true way), in half-form (for the sake of attaining benefit), knowing this, in the Jivaastikaya mentioned in it, determines himself (his own soul) to be extremely pure, of the nature of consciousness, seeing the changes in his form, imposed by the tradition of Anadi Rāgadveshaparināma and Karmabandha, which are mutually cause and effect, at that time, when the light of discrimination manifests, he leaves the Rāgadveshaparināti, which initiates the tradition of Karmabandha, that man, whose affection truly becomes old, faces the inferior quality of affection, like an atom, turning away from future bondage, being freed from past bondage, the suffering, like the condition of water heated by fire (being agitated), he is freed from that. || 103 ||

The description of the six substances and five aggregates [**muyadi**] abandons attachment and aversion [**so**] [**so**] [**dukkhaparimokkha**] attains liberation from suffering [**gahadi**].

**Special Meaning:** The name of this text, "Panchaastikaya Sangraha," is given because it briefly describes the five aggregates and six substances. Primarily, it describes the pure soul aggregate, which is essential for the path of liberation for those souls who are engaged in supreme meditation. Although the Dvadashaanga is very extensive, this text is its essence, as we have said before. By understanding this text, one abandons attachment and aversion, which produce the karmic influx that gives rise to extraordinary joy and sorrow, as well as future attachment and other faults, and which are abandoned by the aspiring soul. This soul, through the feeling of attaining the unchanging soul, experiences the supreme bliss, which is like nectar, and is freed from various types of physical and mental suffering related to the four states of existence. This is the meaning. || 103 ||

This is the description of the process of liberation from suffering. By knowing this meaning, the aspiring soul, having abandoned delusion, becomes free from attachment and aversion, and is freed from both future and past bondage. || 104 ||

**Commentary:** This is the description of the process of liberation from suffering.

First, a soul knows the pure, conscious nature of the soul, which is the meaning of this scripture. Therefore, he strives to follow it. Therefore, his delusion of perception is destroyed, and the light of knowledge shines forth as he becomes aware of his true nature. Then, attachment and aversion are pacified. Then, both future and past bondage are destroyed. Then, because there is no longer any cause for bondage, he remains eternally in his true nature. || 104 ||

Thus ends the first Shruta Skandha of the Samaya Vyakhya, which describes the six substances and five aggregates. || 1 ||

**Anvayaartha:** [**Jiva:**] The soul (**etad artha jnatva**) knowing this meaning (**tad anugamano dyatah**) striving to follow it (**nihatamoh:**) having destroyed delusion (**darshanamoh ka kshaya kar**) destroying the delusion of perception (**prashamiraragadveshah**) having pacified attachment and aversion (**hatapara parah bhavati**) becomes one who has destroyed both future and past bondage.

**Commentary:** This is the description of the process of liberation from suffering.

First, a soul knows the pure, conscious nature of the soul, which is the meaning of this scripture. Therefore, he strives to follow it. Therefore, his delusion of perception is destroyed, and the light of knowledge shines forth as he becomes aware of his true nature. Then, attachment and aversion are pacified. Then, both future and past bondage are destroyed. Then, because there is no longer any cause for bondage, he remains eternally in his true nature. || 104 ||

Page #275:
---------------------------
The five-fold substance (Panchaastikaya) is the nectar of immortality. 
(271) Delusion (Moha) is destroyed, therefore the light of knowledge (Jnana Jyoti) manifests due to the knowledge of the true nature (Swaroop). Therefore, attachment and aversion (Raga-Dvesha) are pacified and cease. Therefore, the bondage of the past and the future (Aavarana and Aayushya) is destroyed. Therefore, due to the absence of the cause of future bondage, the true nature (Swaroop) always shines and remains powerful (Pratapvant). ||104||

Thus, the first Shruta Skandha, named "Shaddravya-Panchaastikaya Varnan", in the commentary called "Samaya Vyakhya", is completed. 

(Translation of the Sanskrit commentary)
Now, the sequence of the cause of liberation from suffering is explained.
(Muni Doon) Knowing this (Etam) - this directly perceived, eternally blissful, pure soul substance (Jivaastikaya Lakshana) as the true meaning (Artha) of the specific object (Vishishta Padartha), and relying on (Tam Anu) this pure soul substance (Jivaastikaya Lakshana) as the meaning (Artha) to be understood. (Gamanujjudo) Eager to experience (Gamanodyata) and immersed in it (Tanmayatva), (Nihadamoho) free from the delusion (Moha) that hinders the attainment of true knowledge (Samyaktvapratibandhakadarshanamoha) - the realization that the pure soul (Shuddhatma) is the only object worthy of pursuit (Ruciroopa Nishchaya Samyaktvapratibandhakadarshanamoha). Therefore, delusion is destroyed (Nishta Darshanamoha). (Pasami Idaraagadoso) Due to the absence of the delusion (Moha) that hinders the practice of right conduct (Charitra) - the delusion that arises from the attachment to the changing nature of the soul (Nishchalatmaparinatiroopa Nishchaya Charitrapratikulcharitramohodaya) - attachment and aversion (Raga-Dvesha) are pacified. Thus, when there is knowledge of the difference between the self and the non-self (Swaraparayo: Bhedajnaane), and when there is true knowledge (Samyaktv) and right conduct (Charitra) based on the pure soul (Shuddhatma), then (Havdi) it happens. How? (Hadaparaavaro) Destroyed (Hataparaapara). Here, liberation (Moksha) is referred to by the word "Para" because it is the foundation of the qualities like supreme bliss (Paramanandajnaana). The word "Para" refers to liberation (Moksha), and "Apara" refers to the cycle of birth and death (Samsara), which is different from liberation. Therefore, the cycle of birth and death is destroyed (Nishta Paraapara). Who is this? (Jeevo) The aspiring soul (Bhavya Jeeva). ||104||

Thus, two verses (Gatha) have been explained in the sixth section (Sthala), which deals with the fruits of knowing the five-fold substance (Panchaastikaya Parijnaana Phala).

In the first major section (Mahaadhikara), the eighth sub-section (Antaradhikara) known as "Chulika" is to be understood, which consists of eight verses (Gatha) and six sections (Sthala).

In this treatise on the five-fold substance (Panchaastikaya Praabhrut Grantha), the following have been explained in the order mentioned earlier:
- The commentary on the word "Samaya" (Samaya Shabda Peethika) in seven verses (Gatha).
- The commentary on the substance (Dravya Peethika) in fourteen verses (Gatha).
- The importance of right knowledge, conduct, and time (Nishchaya Vyavahar Kaal Mukhyata) in five verses (Gatha).
- The explanation of the soul substance (Jivaastikaya Vyakhyana) in thirty-five verses (Gatha).
- The explanation of the matter substance (Pudgalaastikaya Vyakhyana) in ten verses (Gatha).
- The description of the duality of merit and demerit (Dharmaadharmaastikadwaya Vivaran) in seven verses (Gatha).
- The explanation of the space substance (Aakaashaastikaya Vyakhyana) in seven verses (Gatha).
- The importance of the "Chulika" (Chulika Mukhyatva) in eight verses (Gatha).

Thus, a total of one hundred and eleven verses (Gatha) and eight sub-sections (Adhikara) have been explained.

This first major section (Mahaadhikara) named "Panchaastikaya Shaddravya Praatipadan", written by Shri Jayasenaacharya, in the commentary called "Taatparya Vritti", is completed. ||1||

(Translation of the Hindi commentary)
(Uththanika) Now, the sequence of the means of liberation from suffering is explained.

(Anvaya Sahit Samaanyarth) [Etad] This essence of this treatise (Grantha) - the soul substance (Atma Padartha) - [Muni Uun] knowing (Jan Karke) [Tadanu Gamanujjudo] the aspiring soul (Jeeva) eager to experience (Anubhav Karneka Udyami) [Nihadamoho] destroying (Nash Karke) false belief (Mithyaadarshan) [Pasamiyaragadoso] pacifying (Shant Karta Hua) attachment and aversion (Raga-Dvesha) [Hridaparaavaro] crossing over (Par) from the cycle of birth and death (Samsara) [Havdi] becomes (Ho Jata Hai).

(Vishesharth) This directly perceived (Pratyakshibhut) eternally blissful (Nitya Anandamayi) pure soul substance (Shuddha Jivaastikaya Roopa Padartha) -

Page #276:
---------------------------
A noble soul, by knowing through self-awareness the special description of the six substances and the five astikayas, and by aiming to be absorbed in the pure jiva-astikaya form of substance, with the aim of that very substance, is free from the delusion of perception that prevents the beautiful right perception of 'only the pure soul is worthy of being grasped'. By destroying the delusion of conduct that is contrary to the conduct of certainty, which is the transformation into the unshakeable soul, he becomes free from passions.

**Meaning:** As stated earlier, when there is knowledge of the distinction between self and others, there is the beautiful right perception of the pure soul, then there is the conduct of stability in the pure soul, and then, through this very practice, one crosses over the world. Here, because it is the basis of supreme bliss, supreme knowledge, etc., liberation is called 'para' (beyond) - that which is spoken of by the word 'para', that liberation, destroys the 'apara' (other), that is, the world, which is different from it. || 104 ||

Thus, two verses are completed, stating the fruit of the knowledge of the five astikayas. In this way, in the first great chapter, it is necessary to know the eighth internal chapter, called the 'chulika', through eight verses, from the six realms.

In this treatise called 'Pancha-astikaya', the word 'samaya' is introduced in seven verses, in the order stated earlier, then the substance is introduced in fourteen verses. Then, in five verses, there is the main point of certainty, conduct, and time. Then, in fifty-three verses, there is an explanation of the jiva-astikaya. Then, in ten verses, there is an explanation of the pudgala-astikaya. Then, in seven verses, there is a description of both the dharma-astikaya and the adharma-astikaya. Then, in seven verses, there is an explanation of the akasha-astikaya. Then, in eight verses, there is the main point of the chulika. In this way, eight internal chapters are completed in one hundred and eleven verses. Shri Amritchandra Maharaj has commented on only 104 verses, not on the six verses related to knowledge and one on the distinctions of the punal skandha.

Thus, the first great chapter, which speaks of the five astikayas and the six substances, is completed in the commentary called 'Tatparya-vritti' by Shri Jayasen Acharya. || 1 ||

The first chapter of this scripture explains the pure essence of truth (pure soul essence) to wise beings through the exposition of the nature of substances. Now, the path to that essence (the path to liberation) will be described by introducing the different categories of substances (nine categories of substances). (7)

## Translation:

**274**

The description of the nine substances and the path to liberation. There are ten sub-chapters within this chapter. In the first sub-chapter, starting with the salutation verse, the Acharya explains the path to liberation in the worldly realm, primarily through four verses. This is the first sub-chapter, the "Samudaya Patanika".

**Explanation:**

The author, after saluting the last Tirthankara, the Supreme Lord, declares his intention to explain the nine substances, their relation to the five Astikayas and six Dravyas, and the path to liberation. He begins with a salutation, saying, "I bow down with my head to Mahavira, the cause of non-rebirth."

He then states, "I will explain the nine substances, the different aspects of the five Astikayas and six Dravyas, and the path to liberation."

The author explains that the path to liberation is the cause of infinite knowledge and other virtues, which are the desired fruits for those who thirst for the nectar of liberation. He salutes Mahavira, the last Jinesvara, the embodiment of the three jewels, and the propagator of the present great Dharma Tirtha.

The author then explains that the path to liberation in the worldly realm is the cause of the path to liberation in the absolute realm, which is characterized by the three jewels of non-duality, pure self-awareness, and unwavering perception. He also mentions the nine substances, which are the objects of knowledge and perception, and are the components of the path to liberation in the worldly realm.

Although the path to liberation is explained in detail later in the text, the author briefly mentions the nine substances here. This brief mention is intended to provide a concise overview of the nine substances.

The explanation of the nine substances is presented here. They are the objects of the path to liberation in the worldly realm.

Page #279:
---------------------------
I will now speak of the five Astikayas and six Brahvyakas (Paryatyabhangam), the nine substances that differentiate (Mokkassa) and show the path to liberation (Khocchami).

**Special Meaning:** In the first half of this verse, the author has paid homage to his beloved deity for auspiciousness. This also indicates that the statement of Shri Mahavira Swami is evidence because he preached the great Dharma, the Tirtha, which came in this Ratna Trayamayi (three jewels) tendency. Therefore, he is the cause of cooperation for the Bhavyas, the thirsty souls for the nectar of liberation, the happiness of liberation, for the attainment of infinite knowledge and other qualities, the liberation, in the tradition of the last Tirthankara, Shri Mahavira Swami. In the second half of this verse, the author has pledged that I will describe the nine substances which are the subject of Samyag Darshan and Samyag Gyan, the limbs of the practical path of liberation. This practical path of liberation is the cause of the certain path of liberation in the tradition. Where there is pure soul's interest, perception and unwavering experience, it is called Abhed Ratna Tray or the certain path of liberation. Although there is a special explanation of the path of liberation in the Chulika in this book, there is also a brief explanation of the nine substances here because these nine substances are the subject of the practical path of liberation, this is the intention.

**Path of Liberation:**

The path of liberation is characterized by:

* **Samyaktva-Jnana-Yuktam:**  Combined with right faith and knowledge.
* **Rag-Dos Parihinam:** Free from attachment and aversion.
* **Charitram:** Right conduct.
* **Labdh-Buddhinaam:**  Those who have attained wisdom.
* **Bhavyanam:**  Those who are worthy of liberation.

**Explanation:**

This is the first indication of the path of liberation.

* It is only combined with right faith and knowledge, not with wrong faith and ignorance.
* It is only right conduct, not wrong conduct.
* It is only free from attachment and aversion, not with attachment and aversion.
* It is only the path of liberation, not the path of bondage.
* It is only the path, not the wrong path.
* It is only for those who are worthy of liberation, not for those who are not.
* It is only for those who have attained wisdom, not for those who have not.
* It is only for those who have destroyed their passions, not for those who have not.

This is the eightfold rule that should be observed.

**Meaning:**

Combined with right faith and knowledge, free from attachment and aversion, right conduct, for those who have attained wisdom, for those who are worthy of liberation, the path of liberation is attained.

Page #280:
---------------------------
The description of the path to liberation (moksha) through the nine substances (navapadaartha) is as follows: It is characterized by right faith (sammattananajutta), not by the absence of right faith; it is characterized by right conduct (charitra), not by misconduct; it is characterized by the absence of attachment and aversion (ragadosaparhiina), not by the presence of attachment and aversion; it is the path to liberation (mokkhass maggo), not the path to bondage; it is for the worthy (bhalvaan), not for the unworthy (abhalvaan); it is for those who have attained knowledge (laddhabuddhiin), not for those who have not attained knowledge; it is characterized by the destruction of passions (kshiinakashaya), not by the presence of passions. Thus, there are eight ways to understand this rule.

This is further explained by the principle of affirmation and negation (anvayavyatireka). Affirmation means that something is possible, while negation means that something is not possible. For example, liberation is possible when there is the cause of liberation, which is right faith and conduct. This is affirmation. Liberation is not possible when there is no cause of liberation. This is negation.

This principle is further strengthened by the fact that when there is a cause, such as fire, there is an effect, such as burning. When there is no cause, there is no effect. Therefore, the effect is dependent on the cause. This is the principle of cause and effect.

Page #281:
---------------------------
The path to complete liberation (Moksha) is only possible for those who have attained the five great vows (Panchaastikaya). As long as there are passions (Kashaya) and the soul is impure, the path to complete liberation is not possible. Here, we should consider the eight types of rules based on Anvaya and Vyatireka. Anvaya and Vyatireka are described as follows: the presence of which makes an action possible is called Anvaya, and the absence of which makes an action impossible is called Vyatireka. For example, the liberation (Moksha) action is possible only when the cause of liberation, which is the state of certainty and conduct (Nischya Vyavahar), is present. This is called Anvaya in the form of a rule. And when this cause of liberation is absent, the action of liberation does not occur. This is called Vyatireka in the form of a prohibition. This is further strengthened by the example that smoke, etc., can only occur when there is fire, etc., as the cause. When fire, etc., are absent, smoke, etc., will not occur. Because fire, etc., are the cause of smoke, etc., there is a rule between action and cause. This is the meaning. || 106 ||

The right faith, knowledge, and conduct (Samyagdarshan, Samyagjnana, Samyacharita) should be explained. The understanding of these (Bhavas) is called knowledge (Jnana). The right conduct (Charitra) is the state of equanimity (Samabhava) towards all objects (Vishaya) and the avoidance of wrong paths (Virudha-Margas). || 107 ||

Right faith (Samyaktva) is the understanding of these (Bhavas) as faith (Shraddha). || 107 ||

Right conduct (Charitra) is the state of equanimity (Samabhava) towards all objects (Vishaya) and the avoidance of wrong paths (Virudha-Margas). || 107 ||

The nine substances (Bhavas) are the forms of the five great vows (Panchaastikaya) that have been refined by time (Kalakalit). The absence of faith (Ashraddha) due to the rise of wrong faith (Mithyadarshan) is one substance. The other substance is faith (Shraddha), which is the right faith (Samyagdarshan), the seed of the certainty of the true nature of the soul (Atmatattva) as pure consciousness (Shuddhachaitanya). The removal of these (Bhavas) that are wrongly perceived due to the rise of wrong faith (Mithyadarshan) and the influence of past karmas (Naubhyana-Samskara), etc., is the right knowledge (Samyagjnana), the seed of the realization of the true nature of the soul (Atmatattva) as the mind, knowledge, and consciousness (Manamjnana-Chetana). The right conduct (Samyacharita) is the state of equanimity (Samabhava) towards all objects (Vishaya) and the avoidance of wrong paths (Virudha-Margas) due to the presence of right faith (Samyagdarshan) and right knowledge (Samyagjnana). It is the seed of the happiness of liberation (Aponarbhava-Soukhya) that is not subject to change (Atyarmanee), not subject to desire (Ananee), and not subject to rebirth (Aponarbhava). This is the three-fold path to liberation (Moksha) which will be explained further by the state of certainty and conduct (Nischya Vyavahar). Here, the nine substances (Navapadarthas) are mentioned as the reason for introducing them as the subject of right faith (Samyagdarshan) and right knowledge (Samyagjnana). || 107 ||

Meaning of Anvaya: (Bhavanaam) of the substances (Navapadarthoka) (Shraddhanam) faith (Samyaktva) is the right faith, [Teshaam Adhigamo] their understanding (Jnana) is knowledge, (Virudha-Marganaam) on the wrong paths (Vishayeshu) towards the objects (Samabhava) equanimity (Charitram) is right conduct.

Page #282:
---------------------------
This is an explanation of the path to liberation, which is based on right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct.

The nine substances, along with time, are the six categories of existence, which are actually 'states'. The false faith that arises from the emergence of false perception is the absence of faith in these 'states'. The opposite of this is right faith, which is faith in these nine substances. Right faith is the seed of the certainty of the true nature of the soul, which is pure consciousness. Just as the experience of sailing in a boat is a result of the boat's construction, the emergence of false perception leads to a distorted understanding of these 'states'. When the emergence of false perception ceases, the correct understanding of these 'states' is called right knowledge. This is the seed of the experience of the soul, which is primarily knowledge and consciousness. 

Right conduct is the state of equanimity that arises from the harmony of right faith and right knowledge. This equanimity is free from the passions of attachment and aversion towards the objects of the senses and mind. It is the seed of the supreme happiness of liberation, which is free from rebirth.

This unique path to liberation, which is based on right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, will be further explained in terms of its certainty and practice. Here, the nine substances, which are the subject matter of right faith and right knowledge, have been introduced as a preface. ||107||

**Sanskrit Commentary:**

Now, the special description of the three-fold path of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct is given.

What is right faith? It is faith that is free from the opposite attachment that arises from the emergence of falsehood. To whom does this faith pertain? It pertains to the 'states', which are the six categories of existence, the two categories of living and non-living beings, the seven substances that arise from the combination of soul and matter, and the nine substances including the soul. This is the right faith that pertains to the nine substances. What is its special characteristic? It is the seed of the certainty of the true nature of the soul, which is the pure consciousness of the soul, and it is the seed of the right faith that destroys the false faith.

The understanding of these nine substances is the understanding that is free from the opposite attachment that is like the construction of a boat. It is the understanding that is free from doubt. Right knowledge is the knowledge that pertains to the nine substances. It is the seed of the knowledge of the soul, which is the knowledge of the soul's own consciousness. This knowledge of the soul's own consciousness is the seed of perfect knowledge.

Right conduct is the state of equanimity. To what does it pertain? It pertains to the objects of the senses and mind, which are the sources of pleasure and pain, good and bad. To whom does it pertain? It pertains to those who have been freed from all other paths by the power of right faith and right knowledge, and who have firmly established themselves on the path of liberation. This is the right conduct that pertains to the external world. It is the seed of the certainty of happiness, which is the happiness of being free from attachment and the happiness of the soul. This certainty of happiness is the seed of the infinite happiness of liberation.

Here, although the two types of certainty and practice have been explained in order to explain the means and the end, ...

## The Five Astikayas and the Nine Substances

**279**

The essence of this section is that the **practice of the path to liberation** is the primary focus, **with the nine substances as its subject**. || 107 ||

Thus, the first sub-chapter, which deals with the **practice of the path to liberation**, is concluded with four verses, primarily focusing on the **exposition of the nine substances** in the second major chapter.

**Hindi Translation:**

The **Uttanika** further explains the **three jewels** of **Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct**.

**General Meaning with Anvaya:**

(**Bhavanaam**) The **belief** (**Sahahanam**) in (**Sampattam**) the **Right Faith** is the **acceptance** (**Tesim**) of (**Adhigamah**) the **knowledge** (**Naanam**) of the **Right Knowledge**. (**Virudhamgaanam**) The **liberated souls** (**Visyesu**) in the **objects of the senses** (**Samabhavah**) have **equanimity** (**Charitam**) which is the **Right Conduct**.

**Specific Meaning:**

The **five Astikayas** and the **six substances** are differentiated into **two substances**, **living** and **non-living**. From the **combination** of the **living** and the **non-living**, the other **seven substances** arise, such as **influx**, etc. The **practice** of these **nine substances**, including the **living**, which are the **subject of Right Faith**, is the **Right Faith**, excluding the **opposite views** that arise from **falsehood**. This **Right Faith** is only **worthy of being accepted** by the **pure soul**. This **beautiful certainty** is the **seed** of **Right Faith** and the **self-awareness** of the **soul** in the **stage of limited knowledge**. This **self-awareness** is the **seed** of **perfect knowledge**. The **unwavering** and **true knowledge** of these **nine substances** is the **Right Knowledge**. And, by the **power** of **Right Faith** and **Right Knowledge**, the **liberated souls**, who are **distinct** from all other paths, **ascend** the **path to liberation**. Their **equanimity** or **detachment** towards **auspicious** or **inauspicious** objects, which are the **causes** of the **arising** of **pleasure** or **pain** within the **senses** and **mind**, is the **Right Conduct**. This **practical conduct** is an **external means**, and it is the **seed** of the **blissful certainty** that arises from the **feeling** of **detachment**, which is the **nature** of the **Supreme Soul**. This **blissful certainty** is the **seed** of **imperishable** and **infinite bliss**. Here, both **certainty** and **practice** are mentioned to explain the **relationship** between the **means** and the **end**. However, the **essence** is that the **practice** with the **nine substances as its subject** is the **primary focus** of the **path to liberation**. || 107 ||

In this way, the first sub-chapter, which deals with the **practice of the path to liberation**, is concluded with four verses, primarily focusing on the **exposition of the nine substances** in the second major chapter.

**Now, the Right Faith in practice will be explained.**

Description of the nine substances, the path to liberation, and the state of being a Jina, along with the attitude of faith.
For a person who has attained Abhinibodha, the term "darshanika" is appropriate. ||1||

**Explanation:**

As stated earlier, the Jina-prajnapta (the teachings of the Jinas, the omniscient and free from attachments), are embraced with faith (saddhamanassa) and a desire for their essence (bhavadu). These are the karmic afflictions. The term "bhava" refers to all substances, including the soul (dravya) and its attributes, such as knowledge, perception, and the ability to perceive the general and specific nature of all things in the three worlds and three times. This applies to the bhavyajiva (the soul destined for liberation). When Abhinibodha (the knowledge of the self) is present, whether it is through intellectual understanding (matijnana) or through scriptural knowledge (shrutajnana), the term "darshanika" (one who has attained darshan) is appropriate.

While this sutra touches upon the state of perfect knowledge (nishchaya samyaktvam), which is characterized by a pure and unchanging soul and a state of non-dualistic samadhi, it primarily emphasizes the practical aspect of right conduct (vyavahara samyaktvam), which is characterized by a desire for the essence of external substances. This is because the main focus is on what is intended. This is further emphasized by the fact that this sutra introduces the path to liberation through practical conduct. ||1||

**Hindi Translation:**

**Uttanika:** Further, we call it practical right faith.

**Note:** This verse is not found in the commentary of Shri Amrit Chandraji.

**Anvaya (Word Order) with General Meaning:**

(Evam) As said before, (jina-prajnapte) the teachings of the Jinas, (bhave) the substances, (bhavadu) with a desire for their essence, (saddhamanassa) those who have faith, (purisassa) the bhavyajiva, (abhinibodha) in knowledge, (darshanasaddho) the term "darshanika", (jutto) is appropriate, (havadhi) becomes.

**Specific Meaning:**

Here, the substances refer to all things in the three worlds and three times, including the soul (dravya) and its attributes, such as knowledge, perception, and the ability to perceive the general and specific nature of all things. This sutra, while touching upon the state of perfect knowledge (nishchaya samyaktvam), primarily emphasizes the practical aspect of right conduct (vyavahara samyaktvam). This is because the main focus is on what is intended. This is further emphasized by the fact that this sutra introduces the path to liberation through practical conduct. ||1||

**Names and Definitions of Substances:**

Jiva (soul), Bhava (existence), Punna (merit), Pavam (demerit), Asava (afflictions), Samvara (restraint), Nijjara (destruction), Bandha (bondage), and Moksha (liberation) are the eight substances. ||108||

## The Nine Tattvas: A Detailed Explanation

**The Nine Tattvas (Substances):**

* **Jiva (Soul):** The living being, characterized by consciousness.
* **Ajīva (Non-Soul):** The non-living, characterized by the absence of consciousness. This includes five categories:
    * **Pudgala (Matter):** The fundamental building block of the universe.
    * **Dharma (Motion):** The principle of motion and change.
    * **Adharma (Rest):** The principle of rest and stillness.
    * **Ākāśa (Space):** The principle of space and extension.
    * **Kāla (Time):** The principle of time and duration.

**The Seven Derived Tattvas:**

* **Puṇya (Merit):** The positive consequence of the soul's actions, resulting from the accumulation of good karma.
* **Pāpa (Demerit):** The negative consequence of the soul's actions, resulting from the accumulation of bad karma.
* **Āsrava (Inflow):** The continuous inflow of karma into the soul, fueled by attachment, aversion, and delusion.
* **Samvara (Control):** The control of the inflow of karma through the practice of non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, chastity, and non-attachment.
* **Nirjarā (Declination):** The gradual decline of karma through the practice of austerities and meditation.
* **Bandha (Bondage):** The binding of the soul to the cycle of rebirth due to the accumulation of karma.
* **Mokṣa (Liberation):** The complete liberation from the cycle of rebirth, achieved through the complete eradication of karma.

**Explanation:**

These nine substances are the fundamental building blocks of the Jain universe. The soul (Jiva) is the primary entity, while the non-soul (Ajīva) provides the material basis for its existence. The seven derived substances are the consequences of the interaction between the soul and the non-soul. They represent the various stages of the soul's journey towards liberation.

**The Interplay of the Tattvas:**

The soul's actions (karma) create the conditions for its future experiences. Positive actions lead to merit (Puṇya), while negative actions lead to demerit (Pāpa). The inflow of karma (Āsrava) fuels the cycle of rebirth. Through the practice of control (Samvara), the soul can gradually reduce the inflow of karma. This leads to the decline of karma (Nirjarā) and ultimately to liberation (Mokṣa).

**The Goal of Jainism:**

The ultimate goal of Jainism is to achieve liberation (Mokṣa) by eradicating all karma and attaining a state of pure consciousness. This is achieved through the practice of non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, chastity, and non-attachment.

**Description of the Nine Substances and the Path to Liberation**

**Aasrava** is the result of the attachment and aversion of the soul, which is the inflow of karmic particles into the soul due to the actions of the soul. **Samvara** is the restraint of the result of the attachment and aversion of the soul, which is the restraint of the inflow of karmic particles into the soul due to the actions of the soul. **Nirjara** is the purification of the soul, which is the destruction of the potency of karma through the practice of twelve types of austerities, and the consequent shedding of some of the accumulated karmic particles. **Bandha** is the attachment of the soul, which is the result of the attachment and aversion of the soul, and the consequent binding of the soul with karmic particles. **Moksha** is the liberation of the soul, which is the complete purification of the soul and the complete separation of the soul from karmic particles.

**108**

**Commentary:**

Now, the author describes the names and nature of the nine substances, primarily their names and secondarily their nature.

The two substances, soul and non-soul, are the foundation. The two substances, merit and demerit, are derived from them. The four substances, Aasrava, Samvara, Nirjara, and Bandha, are also derived from them. Thus, these are the nine well-known substances. Now, the author describes their nature.

The soul is the substance of knowledge and perception. The non-soul is the substance of five types, different from the soul, namely, matter, space, time, motion, and rest. Merit is the good result of the soul, such as giving, worship, and the six essentials. Merit is the karmic particle of good nature, such as knowledge and good conduct, which is produced due to merit. Demerit is the bad result of the soul, such as wrong belief, attachment, and aversion. Demerit is the karmic particle of bad nature, such as ignorance and bad conduct, which is produced due to demerit. Aasrava is the result of the attachment and aversion of the soul, which is the inflow of karmic particles into the soul due to the actions of the soul. Samvara is the restraint of the result of the attachment and aversion of the soul, which is the restraint of the inflow of karmic particles into the soul due to the actions of the soul. Nirjara is the purification of the soul, which is the destruction of the potency of karma through the practice of twelve types of austerities, and the consequent shedding of some of the accumulated karmic particles. Bandha is the attachment of the soul, which is the result of the attachment and aversion of the soul, and the consequent binding of the soul with karmic particles. Moksha is the liberation of the soul, which is the complete purification of the soul and the complete separation of the soul from karmic particles.

Thus, the meaning of the sutra is explained.

This is one verse of the sutra, which primarily indicates the nine substances, soul and non-soul, and their nature.

**Hindi Commentary:**

The author further describes the names and nature of the nine substances, primarily their names and secondarily their nature.

**Meaning with Anvaya:**

(Soul and non-soul) Soul and non-soul are the substances. (Merit and demerit) Merit and demerit are the substances derived from them. (Aasrava, Samvara, Nirjara, and Bandha) The four substances, Aasrava, Samvara, Nirjara, and Bandha, are also derived from them. Thus, these are the nine well-known substances. Now, the author describes their nature.

Page #287:
---------------------------
The nine substances (**dravya**) are: **Panchaastikaya** (five categories of non-living matter), **Jiva** (living being), **Punnya** (merit), **Papa** (demerit), **Asrava** (influx), **Samvara** (restriction), **Nirjara** (effusion), **Bandha** (bondage), and **Moksha** (liberation).

**Explanation:**

* **Jiva:** The living being, characterized by the ability to perceive and know.
* **Ajiva:** The five categories of non-living matter, distinct from the Jiva, such as matter, space, time, motion, and rest.
* **Punnya:** Merit, a state of mind characterized by good intentions and actions, such as generosity and worship. It manifests as **dravya punnya**, a collection of **pudgala** (matter) particles with auspicious qualities.
* **Papa:** Demerit, a state of mind characterized by negative intentions and actions, such as false beliefs and anger. It manifests as **dravya papa**, a collection of **pudgala** particles with inauspicious qualities.
* **Asrava:** Influx, the flow of negative karmic tendencies (**raga**, **dvesha**, **moha**) into the Jiva. It manifests as **dravya asrava**, the influx of karmic matter into the Jiva.
* **Samvara:** Restriction, the cessation of the influx of karmic tendencies. It manifests as **dravya samvara**, the cessation of the influx of karmic matter.
* **Nirjara:** Effusion, the gradual shedding of accumulated karma through **tapas** (austerities). It manifests as **dravya nirjara**, the shedding of karmic matter.
* **Bandha:** Bondage, the attachment of the Jiva to karmic matter due to negative tendencies. It manifests as **dravya bandha**, the entanglement of the Jiva with karmic matter.
* **Moksha:** Liberation, the complete detachment of the Jiva from karmic matter, leading to the realization of the pure soul. It manifests as **dravya moksha**, the complete separation of the Jiva from karmic matter.

This concludes the explanation of the nine substances in this text. The next section will discuss the **Jiva** in detail.

## Chapter 284: Description of the Path to Liberation through the Nine Substances and the Nature of the Soul

This is a description of the nature of the soul, the path to liberation through the nine substances. Souls in the cycle of existence are of two types: those bound to the cycle and those liberated. They are also characterized by their function and by their association with bodies.

**Verse 109:** Souls in the cycle of existence are bound and liberated, and they are all characterized by consciousness. They are also characterized by their function, which is the result of consciousness. Those in the cycle of existence are associated with bodies, while those liberated are not.

**Explanation:** This is a statement about the nature of the soul. Souls are of two types: (1) those bound to the cycle of existence, which are impure, and (2) those liberated, which are pure. Both are inherently conscious and can be recognized by their function, which is the result of consciousness. Those bound to the cycle of existence are associated with bodies, while those liberated are not.

**Commentary:** This chapter discusses the nature of the soul in detail. The first verse introduces the topic of the soul, stating that souls are of two types: those bound to the cycle of existence and those liberated. The next four verses discuss the different types of beings in the cycle of existence, based on their senses. The following three verses discuss the three types of beings with incomplete senses. The next four verses discuss the four types of realms (hell, animal, human, and god) and the five senses. The next two verses discuss the nature of karma and the consequences of actions. The final verse concludes the discussion of the soul and introduces the topic of non-soul substances. 

This chapter, with its fifteen verses, covers the second chapter of the second part of the text. It discusses the nature of the soul and how souls are different from each other. It also discusses the different types of beings in the cycle of existence and the consequences of their actions.

Page #289:
---------------------------
The five astikayas, beginning with the first,
285
are also completed. There are two types of chetanas. Both are chetanatmaka, karma-chetanatmaka, karma-phala-chetanatmaka. Samsarin are shuddha-chetanatmaka, mukta. Ubaogalakkhana is also upayogalakshana. The use of the soul is in accordance with the awareness, the muktas are of the nature of knowledge and vision. The samsarin are of the nature of impure use, which is the cause of destruction. Deha-deha-praveechara-deha-deha-praveechara are deha-praveechara with a body opposite to the true nature of the soul, without a body, they are siddha. This is the meaning of the sutra. || 109 ||
Thus, the first place has been reached in the form of a gatha indicating the authority of the jiva.
Further information about the statement - Further, the authority of the jiva substance is stated in fifteen gathas - Among these fifteen gathas, the main gathasutra is "jiva sansartya" etc., which indicates the authority of the jiva substance. Then, there are four gathas in the order of "puthavi tha" etc., mainly about the five stationary one-sensory beings, starting with the earth body. Then, there are three gathas in the order of "sambukk" etc., mainly about the explanation of the three vikalendriya. Then, there are eight gathas from "suranar" etc., stating the four types of panchendriya related to naraki, tiryanch, manushya and devagati. Then, there are two gathas from "chha hi indiyani" etc., mainly about the feeling of difference, the doership of good and bad, and the experience of it. After that, there is one sutra from "evam adhigamm" etc., mainly about the contraction of the jiva substance and the beginning of the jiva substance. In this way, the community of the second internal authority is said through six places in fifteen gathas.
Hindi Ta. - Uththani-ka - Further, the nature of the jiva is stated.
General meaning with anuvaya - (Jiva) The community of jivas (duviha) is of two types (sansartya) Samsari who live in the world (nivyada) Siddha who have attained liberation (vedanappagga) These are chetanmayi, (uvaogalakkhana) They are also of the nature of use (b) and (dehadeha-praveechara) They are body-enjoyers and body-less. Those who are samsari are with a body, and those who are siddha are without a body.
Special meaning - The commentator has made this meaning by giving two special qualities of chetanatmaka, that these samsari jivas are impure chetanmayi and the liberated jivas are pure chetanmayi. There are two types of impure chetana - karma-chetana and karma-phala-chetana. The experience of doing work with attachment and aversion is karma-chetana. And the experience of being happy and unhappy is karma-phala-chetana. The experience of the pure knowledge and bliss nature of the soul is pure knowledge-chetana. Within the quality of awareness,

**Subject:** Description of the Path to Liberation

The use of **parinaama** (transformation) is mentioned. It is also said, "**Chaitanyaanuvidhaayi parinaama upayogaha**" (Transformation is the means for the attainment of consciousness). For liberated beings, only **kevalajnaana** (omniscience) and **kevaladarshana** (omniscient perception) are the means, whereas worldly beings have means that are impure or in the form of **kshayopashama** (diminishing of karmas), such as **matijnaana** (knowledge). Worldly beings are possessors of bodies, contrary to the **aatmatattva** (soul principle) which is devoid of a body, whereas **siddh** (liberated) beings are devoid of all types of bodies. || 109 ||

In this way, the first section of the information about the **jivaadhikaara** (rights of the soul) in the form of a **gaatha** (verse) is complete.

This is about the five types of bodies: **prithvikaayika** (earth body), **apkaayika** (water body), **tejakaayika** (fire body), **vaayukaayika** (air body), and **vanaspatikaayika** (plant body).

**Verse 110:**

The bodies of earth, water, fire, air, and plants are associated with living beings. They give rise to a lot of **moha** (delusion) and **sparsha** (touch) to the living beings residing in them, even though they are numerous. || 110 ||

**Explanation:**

**Prithvikaaya**, **apkaaya**, **tejakaaya**, **vaayukaaya**, and **vanaspatikaaya** - these **pudgala parinaama** (transformations of matter) are associated with living beings due to **bandha** (bondage). Due to the difference in **avaantara jaati** (sub-species), even though they are numerous, they all (**pudgala parinaama**) are the cause of the formation of the external **sparshendriya** (sense of touch) for living beings who have **kshayopashama** (diminishing of karmas) in the **sparshendriyaavaraana** (covering of the sense of touch). Because they are primarily driven by **karmaphala chetana** (consciousness of the fruits of karma), they give rise to **sparshopaalabdhi** (perception of touch) that is full of **moha** (delusion). || 110 ||

**Meaning:**

(**Prithvi**) Earth body, (**udakam**) water body, (**jala kaaya**) (**agni**) fire body, (**vaayu**) air body (**cha**) and (**vanaspati**) plant body (**kaaya**) - these bodies are (**jivaasanśrita**) associated with living beings. (**Bahuka: api te**) Even though they are numerous (in comparison to the sub-species), they all (**teshaam**) give (**khala**) truly (**mohabhulaam**) a lot of delusion (**sparsham dadati**) touch (i.e., they are the cause of the knowledge of touch).

**Commentary:**

(From the differences in worldly beings) there is a mention of the five types of bodies: earth body, water body, fire body, air body, and plant body. These **pudgala parinaama** (transformations of matter) are associated with living beings due to **bandha** (bondage). Even though they are numerous due to the difference in **avaantara jaati** (sub-species), they all (**pudgala parinaama**) are the cause of the formation of the external **sparshendriya** (sense of touch) for living beings who have **kshayopashama** (diminishing of karmas) in the **sparshendriyaavaraana** (covering of the sense of touch). Because they are primarily driven by **karmaphala chetana** (consciousness of the fruits of karma), they give rise to **sparshopaalabdhi** (perception of touch) that is full of **moha** (delusion). || 110 ||

**Summary:**

This section discusses the five types of bodies associated with living beings: earth, water, fire, air, and plants. These bodies are a result of **karma** (actions) and are the cause of **moha** (delusion) and **sparsha** (touch) for the living beings residing in them. 

**Note:** The text uses several Jain terms, including **parinaama**, **kevalajnaana**, **kevaladarshana**, **kshayopashama**, **matijnaana**, **aatmatattva**, **siddh**, **jivaadhikaara**, **gaatha**, **prithvikaayika**, **apkaayika**, **tejakaayika**, **vaayukaayika**, **vanaspatikaayika**, **pudgala parinaama**, **bandha**, **avaantara jaati**, **sparshendriya**, **sparshendriyaavaraana**, **karmaphala chetana**, and **sparshopaalabdhi**. These terms are specific to Jain philosophy and are used to explain the nature of the soul, liberation, and the cycle of birth and death.

## Translation:

**Verse 110:**

The essence of the self is luminous and radiant, but due to the lack of contemplation of this essence, a being, driven by the desire for limited pleasures, becomes attached to the objects of the sense of touch and acquires the karma called "Ekaindriya-jati" (one-sense-category). This karma, at the time of its arising, leads to the cessation of the sense of touch and the being evolves through the knowledge of the objects of touch. This is the meaning of the sutra.

**Verse 111:**

There are three types of stationary beings: those with earth-bodies, water-bodies, and plant-bodies. There are also beings with air-bodies and fire-bodies. These beings are all fearful. They are devoid of mental transformations and are known as one-sense beings.

**Commentary:**

This verse explains that beings with air and fire bodies are also fearful, even though they are not stationary like earth, water, and plant beings. This is because they are seen to move in the context of the five stationary beings. However, they are not fearful because of mental transformations, but because of their one-sense nature. They are devoid of mental transformations and are known as one-sense beings.

**Note:**

The terms "Ekaindriya-jati" and "Pancha-astika" are specific to Jainism and refer to categories of beings based on their senses and their karmic attachments.

**Description of the Nine Substances and the Path to Liberation**

Although the fire and air-bodied beings appear to move in practical terms, due to their dependence on the arising of the karma called "stationary," they are in fact stationary in essence. || 111 ||

**Hindi Translation:**

The text shows that in practical terms, fire and air-bodied beings can be called "mobile" due to their movement.

**General Meaning with Anvaya:**

(Tesu) Among these five, (ti sthavaratanujoga) three are stationary, namely earth, water, and plant-bodied, due to their fixed bodies. (Ya) And (anilaanalakayiya) air-bodied and fire-bodied beings (tasa) are called mobile beings. (Eindiya jiva) It is (neya) to be known that one-sensed beings (manparinamvirhida) are devoid of the transformation of the mind.

**Special Meaning:**

The soul, which is distinct from the arising of the karma called "stationary" and inseparable from the infinite knowledge and other qualities, is devoid of experience in the beings bound by the karma called "stationary." Due to their dependence on the arising of this karma, although fire and air-bodied beings appear to move in practical terms, they are in fact stationary in essence. || 111 ||

* The earth-bodied and others are one-sensed due to the absence of the mind and the cessation of the covering of the sense of touch, and the arising of the covering of the remaining senses. || 112 ||

**Anvaya:**

(Ete) These (prithivakayikadya) earth-bodied and others (panchavidha) five types of (jivanikaya) life forms are (manah parinamvirhita) devoid of the transformation of the mind, (ekendriya) one-sensed beings (bhanita) (sarvgyane) are called.

**Commentary:**

This is the rule for the one-sensed nature of the earth-bodied and other five types of beings.

The earth-bodied and other beings are one-sensed and devoid of mind due to the cessation of the covering of the sense of touch and the arising of the covering of the remaining senses and the arising of the covering of the mind. || 112 ||

* The fire-bodied and air-bodied beings are called mobile in practical terms due to their movement, but in essence, they are stationary due to their dependence on the karma called "stationary." (Although they move in practical terms, they are still stationary).

## Pancastikaya Prabhruta 289

**The text establishes that the five types of beings, starting with the Earth-bodied, are all one-sensed.** These five types of beings, starting with the Earth-bodied, are directly perceived as living beings. How are they? They are devoid of mental modifications, not only devoid of mental modifications but also one-sensed. In what context are they said to be one-sensed? They are one-sensed due to the destruction and cessation of the obstacles to vigor and the covering of the sense of touch, and due to the arising of the covering of the other senses, or due to the non-arising of the covering of the other senses. 

**Although this sutra, with its definitive statement, does not indicate the existence of the five categories of beings, starting with the Earth-bodied, as separate from pure existence, yet according to the practical point of view, due to the arising of the karma called "one-sensed category," which is associated with impure mental defilements like attachment, etc., and devoid of pure mental self-awareness, these beings become one-sensed, even though they are devoid of mind.**

**This is an illustration and explanation of the consciousness of the one-sensed beings.**

**Just as eggs, embryos, and humans in a state of unconsciousness are one-sensed, so too are these beings.**

**Even though we see intelligent activity in eggs, embryos, and unconscious humans, we still know that they are living beings. Similarly, because the one-sensed beings also exhibit intelligent activity, we know that they are living beings.**

**Description of the Nine Substances and the Path to Liberation**

**Anvayaartha (Meaning with Word Order):** (**Andeshupravardhamanaha**) Creatures growing in eggs, (**Garbhasthaha**) creatures residing in the womb (**Cha**) and (**Murchagataha; Manushaha**) humans in a state of unconsciousness (**Yadrushaha**) like these (**Buddhipoorvak Vyapaar Rahith Hote Huye Bhi**) beings who are devoid of conscious activity, (**Tadrushaha**) similarly (**Ekendiyaha Jivaaha**) one-sensed beings (**Jneyaaha**) are to be known.

**Tika (Commentary):** This is a statement of an example regarding the existence of consciousness in one-sensed beings.

**Explanation:** Just as we do not see conscious activity in creatures residing in eggs, in the womb, or in a state of unconsciousness, yet we are certain of their existence as living beings, similarly, we are certain of the existence of one-sensed beings as living beings, because the absence of conscious activity is the same in both. ||113||

**Santa (Explanation):** Now, to illustrate the existence of consciousness in earth-bodied beings and one-sensed beings, it is said: "Creatures growing in eggs, residing in the womb, and humans in a state of unconsciousness, are like those who are devoid of conscious activity; similarly, one-sensed beings are to be known." Just as we know the existence of consciousness in egg-born creatures by observing the growth of their bodies, even though they do not engage in external activities, and we know the absence of consciousness in the dead by observing their lifelessness, so it is with one-sensed beings. The meaning here is: Although the soul, in its true nature, is independent and possesses infinite knowledge and happiness, it becomes attached to the pleasures of the senses, which are dependent on external objects, due to ignorance. The actions it performs in this state of ignorance bind it, causing it to experience suffering as a one-sensed being, similar to egg-born creatures. ||113||

Thus, the explanation of the five stationary beings, primarily through four verses, has reached the second stage.

**Hindi Ta (Hindi Translation):** Uththānika (Introduction): Further, to explain that earth-bodied beings and one-sensed beings possess the quality of consciousness, an example is given.

**Anvaya Sahith Samaanyārtha (General Meaning with Word Order):** (**Jarisaaya**) Just as (**Andeshupravartunta**) creatures grow in eggs, (**Galbhattha**) reside in the womb (**Ya**) and (**Muchchagaya**) humans in a state of unconsciousness (**Maanusha**) live, (**Tarisaaya**) similarly (**Egendriya Jivaa**) one-sensed beings (**Jneyaa**) are to be known.

**Visheshārtha (Specific Meaning):** Just as we do not see the creatures inside eggs, the animals in the womb, or the humans in a state of unconsciousness engaging in conscious activity, so it is with these one-sensed beings. This means that we should know that even though we do not see egg-born creatures engaging in external activities, they possess consciousness within. The same applies to animals and humans in the womb. The growth of the womb indicates the presence of consciousness. A person in a state of unconsciousness can regain consciousness immediately. Similarly, we should know that there is consciousness within one-sensed beings.

Page #295:

## Five Astikayas and Beyond

**291**

It is understood that when a being in the womb, an egg, or in a state of unconsciousness becomes lifeless, i.e., does not grow or its bodily functions cease, then it is assumed that the soul is no longer present. Similarly, when a one-sense being becomes lifeless or inert, it becomes devoid of life and consciousness. It is worth noting here that this soul, by its very nature, is endowed with infinite knowledge and infinite bliss, independent of anything else. However, due to its attachment to the pleasures of the senses, it binds karma, which, upon its fruition, leads the soul to become a one-sense being, like an egg-born, and plunges it into suffering. || 113 ||

**The second section, primarily through four verses, completes the discussion of the five stationary beings.**

**Concerning the two-sense beings:**

*Shank, conch, oyster, and footless worms, which perceive taste and touch, are two-sense beings.*

**Explanation:** This is an explanation of the types of two-sense beings.

Due to the destruction or cessation of the coverings of the touch and taste senses, and the emergence of the coverings of the remaining senses, or the non-emergence of the coverings of the remaining senses, these beings (like conch, etc.) who perceive touch and taste become two-sense beings without a mind. || 114 ||

**Commentary:**

Here, the different types of two-sense beings are described. Shank, conch, oyster, and footless worms are the agents who perceive both touch and taste. Therefore, these beings are two-sense beings.

For example, the pure soul, distinct from the two-sense nature, and distinct from the two-fold knowledge and perception, is the pure soul-body. This soul-body, due to its inherent nature, is devoid of the pleasure of taste, which is characterized by eternal bliss. The two-sense beings, who experience the pleasure of taste and touch through their senses, acquire the karma of the two-sense category. When this karma ripens, the coverings of the touch and taste senses are destroyed or cease, and the coverings of the remaining senses emerge or do not emerge. As a result, the two-sense beings become devoid of a mind. || 114 ||

**Description of the Path to Liberation for the Nine Categories of Substances**

**Hindi Ta. - Uttanika - Further, the distinctions among the two-sense beings are described.**

**General Meaning with Anvaya:** (**Sambhukka**) A small conch of a particular species, (**Maduvaha**) Mother-bearing (**Sanka**) Conch (**Sippi**) Shell (**Y**) and (**Apadga**) Footless (**Kimi**) Worms like earthworms, caterpillars, etc. (**Je**) Those who (**Rasan**) know taste or flavor and (**Phasan**) touch (**Jananti**) are (**Te**) those (**Jiwa**) beings (**Beindriya**) with two senses.

**Specific Meaning:** With absolute certainty, this being is distinct from the form of the two-sense being and is inseparable from perfect knowledge and perfect vision, i.e., it is pure and completely the body of existence. By the feeling of such a pure soul, one does not experience the enjoyment of the single characteristic, blissful, delicious taste, but rather, the beings who are engrossed in the enjoyment of the taste of objects, qualities, and flavors like touch and smell, etc., have formed a bond of karma called the name of the two-sense category. At the time of the arising of that karma, due to the benefit of the destruction and pacification of the karma called the covering of the sense of touch and the covering of knowledge, the karma in the form of the covering of the remaining senses arises, and when the karma in the form of the covering of the mind arises, these beings are two-sense beings without a mind. ||114||

**Indication of the Types of Three-Sense Beings:** Lice, bees, beetles, ants, scorpions, etc., insects. They know taste, touch, and smell; these are the three-sense beings. ||115||

**Anvaya:** (**Yuka, Kumbhi, Matkun, Pipilika**) Lice, bees, beetles, ants, and (**Vrischikaadaya**) scorpions, etc. (**Kita**) creatures (**Rasan, Sparsh, Gandhan**) know taste, touch, and smell (**Jananti**) are (**Triindriya**) three-sense beings.

**Commentary:** This is an indication of the types of three-sense beings.

Due to the destruction and pacification of the covering of the sense of touch, the sense of taste, and the sense of smell, and the arising of the covering of the remaining senses, and the arising of their covering, these (lice, etc.) beings are three-sense beings without a mind, who know touch, taste, and smell. ||115||

Page #297:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Verse 115:**

This verse explains the characteristics of three-sense beings. Creatures like ants, bees, wasps, and scorpions perceive touch, taste, and smell. Therefore, they are called three-sense beings. 

The reason for this is that they have experienced the supreme bliss of liberation, which is characterized by pure knowledge, perception, and the nature of the soul. This bliss is like nectar, and it protects them from the suffering caused by the objects of touch, taste, and smell. However, they have still bound themselves to the karma of the three-sense beings, which is dependent on the arising of this karma. 

This karma is overcome by the destruction and pacification of the coverings on the senses of touch, taste, and smell. When the coverings on the remaining senses arise, or when the covering on the mind arises, these three-sense beings become mindless. This is the meaning of the verse.

**Verse 116:**

This verse explains the characteristics of four-sense beings. Creatures like flies, mosquitoes, bees, and butterflies perceive touch, taste, smell, and sight. Therefore, they are called four-sense beings.

The reason for this is that they have overcome the coverings on the senses of touch, taste, smell, and sight. When the covering on the sense of hearing arises, or when the covering on the mind arises, these four-sense beings become mindless. This is the meaning of the verse.

Page #298:
---------------------------
##  294
This is information about the types of four-sense beings. 
Due to the destruction and pacification of the coverings of the touch, taste, smell, and sight senses, and the arising of the covering of the hearing sense and the arising of the covering of the mind, these beings (like flies, etc.) who know touch, taste, smell, and color are four-sense beings without a mind. ||116||

**Commentary:**
Now, the different types of four-sense beings are shown. The purpose is that flies, mosquitoes, bees, bumblebees, moths, etc. know touch, taste, smell, and color, and therefore they are four-sense beings. For example, those who are averse to the drinking of the nectar of happiness that arises from the knowledge of non-attachment, self-awareness, and the feeling of non-attachment, and who are attached to the experiences of happiness in the objects of the senses of touch, taste, smell, and sight, etc., bind the karma called "four-sense being." Due to the ripening of this karma, and due to the destruction and pacification of the coverings of the senses of touch, taste, smell, and sight, and the arising of the covering of the hearing sense and the covering of the mind, they become four-sense beings without a mind. This is the meaning. ||166||

Thus, the explanation of the beings with impaired senses is completed in three verses, mainly.

**Hindi Commentary:**
**Uttanika:** Now, the different types of four-sense beings are explained.

**General Meaning with Anvaya:** (Uins) Flies [Masay] mosquitoes, [Makkhi] flies, [Madhukari] bees, [Bhamra] bumblebees, [Patangamadiya] moths, etc. [Rupan] know color, [Rasan] taste, [Cha] and [Gandhan] smell, [Pun] and [Phasan] touch, [Ananti] know, [Te Vi] they are four-sense beings.

**Specific Meaning:** Those beings who have a false view, are averse to the drinking of the nectar of happiness that arises from the knowledge of non-attachment, self-awareness, and the feeling of non-attachment, and who are attached to the experiences of happiness in the objects of the senses of touch, taste, smell, and sight, etc., bind the karma called "four-sense being." Due to the ripening of this karma, and due to the destruction and pacification of the coverings of the senses of touch, taste, smell, and sight, and the arising of the covering of the hearing sense and the covering of the mind, they become four-sense beings without a mind. This is the meaning. ||116||

In this way, the explanation of the beings with impaired senses is completed in three verses, mainly.

**Information about the types of five-sense beings:**
Suras, humans, narakas, and animals, who know color, taste, touch, smell, and sound, who live in water, on land, and in the air, are strong five-sense beings. ||117||

Page #299:
---------------------------

Those who know color, taste, touch, smell and sound (surenaranarakatiryancha) are the gods, humans, hell-beings and animals (jalacharasthalacharakachara) who are strong, five-sensed beings (balinah panchendriya jeevah). ||177||  When the coverings of the senses of touch, taste, smell, sight and hearing are destroyed or subdued, and the covering of the mind arises, then those who know color, taste, smell, touch and sound are five-sensed beings without minds (amanaska). Some (five-sensed beings) become mindful (samanaska) when the covering of the mind is also destroyed or subdued. Among them, gods, humans and hell-beings are mindful, while animals are of both types (i.e. mindless and mindful). ||117||
Commentary: This is an explanation of the types of five-sensed beings.
Due to the destruction or subduing of the coverings of the senses of touch, taste, smell, sight and hearing, the covering of the mind arises, and those who know color, taste, smell, touch and sound are five-sensed beings without minds. Some (five-sensed beings) become mindful when the covering of the mind is also destroyed or subdued.

**Description of the Nine Substances and the Path to Liberation**

[**Water-dwelling, Land-dwelling, and Sky-dwelling**] Those who are water-dwelling, land-dwelling, and sky-dwelling [**Strong**] such strong [**Beings**] beings [**Color, Taste, Touch, Smell, and Sound**] are able to perceive color, taste, touch, smell, and sound [**Five Senses, Senses**].

**Special Meaning:** The commentator has explained this meaning as follows: Among the lower animals, some have very strong senses, such as the crocodile among water-dwelling creatures, the octopus among land-dwelling creatures, and the vulture among sky-dwelling creatures. Those beings with external souls who are attached to the pleasures of the senses, which are opposite to the unchanging bliss of pure consciousness that arises from meditation on the flawless Supreme Soul, bind the karma of the five senses, known as the "five-sense category." Upon its arising, they acquire the karma of "vigor-hindrance" and the karma of covering the senses of touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing. Due to the destruction and pacification of these covering karmas, they gain the benefit of the five senses. Some beings, upon the arising of the karma that covers knowledge through the mind, become devoid of the five senses and the mind. They are then incapable of learning, conversing, or receiving teachings. Some beings, due to the destruction and pacification of the karma that covers the nine senses, become five-sensed beings with a mind. Among these five-sensed beings, hell-beings, humans, and gods are all "with a mind." The five-sensed lower animals are of two types: "with a mind" and "without a mind." Those with one to four senses are all "without a mind."

Someone might question: "Do beings without a mind also have knowledge of destruction and pacification? And isn't the mind the thought that arises from destruction and pacification? If this thought exists in beings without a mind, why are they called 'without a mind'?" The commentator answers: "Beings without a mind do not have the knowledge of the pervasiveness of cause and effect. They cannot contemplate beforehand, in every situation, that doing this will lead to this benefit and that doing that will lead to this harm. Beings without a mind act according to their nature, without considering benefit or harm. For example, the ant's cleverness in relation to smell and food, etc., is due to its natural disposition. It cannot contemplate or understand other matters. The mind has the power to indirectly know the Supreme Soul and other principles through the knowledge of pervasiveness, which is the knowledge of the three worlds and three times. Therefore, it is similar to pure knowledge."

**117**

... This is a conclusion regarding the relationship of the four paths of existence with the beings described according to their differences in senses.

**118**

... Gods have four bodies, humans are the earth of karma and enjoyment, and lower animals are numerous and diverse, dwelling on the earth.

Page #301:
---------------------------
The four types of beings are:

* **Devas (Gods)**: They are of four types: Bhavanavasi, Vyantara, Jyotishka, and Vaimanika.
* **Manushya (Humans)**: They are of two types: Karmabhoomij and Bhogabhoomij.
* **Tiryanch (Animals)**: They are of many types, based on their physical forms and senses: Prithvi, Shambook, Yook, Uddesh, Jalachar, Urag, Pakshi, Parisarp, Chatushpad, etc.
* **Naraka (Hell beings)**: They are of seven types, based on the type of hell they inhabit: Ratnaprababhoomij, Sharkaraprababhoomij, Valukaprababhoomij, Pankaprababhoomij, Dhoomaprababhoomij, Tamasprababhoomij, and Maha-tamasprababhoomij.

Devas, Manushya, and Naraka all have five senses. However, Tiryanch can have one, two, three, four, or five senses.

## Navapadaartha - Mokshamarga Varnan

**The meaning of the sutra is:** Those beings who are devoid of the feeling of being a Siddha, or devoid of the feeling of their own pure soul being like a Siddha, have accumulated karma called "Chaturgati" (four states of existence). Due to the ripening of this karma, they are born in the states of Devas (gods) and others. || 118 ||

**Hindi Ta. -** Uththānikā - Further, the Jina beings are said to be of four states of existence, based on the difference between one-sense beings and others.

**General meaning with Anvaya:** (Deva) Beings in the Deva state (Chaunnaikaaya) are of four types, in four groups. (Pun) And (Manuya) humans (Kammabhogabhoomiyaa) are those who have the earth of karma and the earth of enjoyment. (Tiriya) Beings in the Tiryanch state (Bahuppayaara) are of many kinds (Neradyaa) beings in hell (Pudhavibheyaagada) are the proof of the difference in the earth.

**Specific meaning:** There are four groups of Devas: Bhavanvaasi, Vyantar, Jyotishi, and Vaimanik. There are two types of humans: those who are born in the earth of enjoyment and those who are born in the earth of karma. Tiryanch beings are of many types. There are five one-sense Tiryanch beings like earth, etc. There are two-sense Tiryanch beings like Shambuk, etc., three-sense Tiryanch beings like fish, etc., and four-sense Tiryanch beings like ants, etc. These are the three types of Vikalatrai Tiryanch beings. There are two-legged, four-legged, etc., five-sense Tiryanch beings that move in water, on land, and in the sky. There are seven earths: Ratna, Sharkara, Baluka, Pank, Dhum, Tam, and Mahatam. There are seven hells in these earths, and the beings who reside in them are called Naraki. The meaning of the sutra here is that beings who are devoid of the feeling of being a Siddha, or devoid of the feeling of their own pure soul being like a Siddha, have accumulated karma called "Chaturgati" (four states of existence). Due to the ripening of this karma, these beings are born in the states of Devas and others. || 118 ||

The specific type of karma called "Gati" (state of existence) and the specific type of karma called "Ayus" (lifespan) that are accumulated by beings gradually diminish. Even so, the seed of their inclination towards the karma of another state of existence and another lifespan, which is fueled by their attachment to the kshayaas (passions), remains. Therefore, they attain another state of existence and another lifespan that is appropriate to that seed. Thus, even though the "Gati" and "Ayus" karmas are gradually diminishing and being renewed again and again, these beings, who are inherently devoid of the nature of the soul, continue to be bound by these karmas and wander in samsara, unaware of their true nature. || 119 ||

## Translation:

**Pancastikaya Prabhrut**

299 Anvayarth - (Purvanibaddhe)  Previously bound (Gatinamni Ayushi Cha)  Gatinam karma and Ayush karma (Kshine)  being exhausted (Te Api)  those Jivas (Swaleshyavashat)  due to their Leshya (Khalu)  indeed (Anyam Gatim Ayushkam Cha)  other Gati and Ayush (Prapnuvanti)  they attain.

**Tika** - Here, it is shown that Devatvaadi (divine states) are not of the nature of the Atma (soul) because they are produced by the arising of Gatinam karma and Ayush karma.

Jivas, whose fruits begin, experience the exhaustion of certain Gatinam karma and certain Ayush karma respectively. Even after this, they have Leshya, which is the seed of other Gati and other Ayush, in the form of Kshaya-Anuranjit Yogapravritti (the tendency towards action influenced by passions). (Meaning, Leshya is the cause of the binding of other Gatinam karma and other Ayush karma), therefore, they attain other Gati and other Ayush according to it. Thus, even after attaining exhaustion and non-exhaustion, the newly arising Gatinam karma and Ayush karma (in the form of a stream), although they are not of the nature of the Atma, remain with the Jivas for a long time. Therefore, Jivas who do not experience the Atma, continue to cycle (meaning, Jivas who do not experience the Atma wander in the world). || 119 ||

**Navapadartha-Mokshamarg** describes the impure states of Vibhava. Or, anyone who argues that there are no other states of a being in the world, that a god dies and remains a god, a human dies and remains a human, their statement is refuted.

**General Meaning with Anvaya:** [Puvanibaddhe] Bound in the past [Gadinama] by the Karma called Gatinam [Cha] and [Ause] by the Karma called Ayu [Khine] when they are destroyed, [Tevi] those beings [Khalu] truly [Salesvasa] under the influence of their own Leshya [Annam] other [Gadim] Gati [Ya] and [Aussam] Ayu [Papunnanti] attain.

**Specific Meaning:** These worldly beings are born again and again, bound by different Gati and Ayu, under the influence of their own results. Krishna, Neel, Kapoot, Peet, Padam, Shukul are the six Leshyas. Their nature is described in detail in Shri Gommatsar, like: "Chandon Muchhai Veram Bhandansileo Ya Dhammadayarhiyo. Dutttho Na Ya Edi Vasan Lakkhanameyam Tu Kinhass. ||509||"

**Meaning:** Those who are fierce, with intense anger, who do not give up hatred, whose nature is to argue and fight, who are devoid of compassion and righteousness, who are wicked, who are not under the control of a Guru or anyone else, these are the characteristics of those with Krishna Leshya.

This is a spiritual text, so it is not described in detail, but we will write briefly: "Kashayo Dayanuranjita Yogapravritti: Leshya". This is the characteristic of Leshya. That is, the tendency of the Yogas colored by the arising of Kashayas is called Leshya. This is the seed of the binding of the auspicious and inauspicious Gatinam Karma and Ayukarma, therefore it is appropriate to destroy Leshya. The way to do this is to have the feeling that "I am different from the four Kashayas of anger, pride, deceit, and greed, and I am not different from the four infinite qualities of infinite vision, infinite knowledge, infinite happiness, and infinite power. I am a being with the nature of the Supreme Soul." Then the arising of Kashayas is destroyed. For this feeling, the activities of the mind, speech, and body are abandoned, whether they are auspicious or inauspicious. In the same way, when the three Yogas are absent, then the Leshya, which is the tendency of the Yogas colored by the arising of Kashayas, is also destroyed. With the absence of Leshya, the Gatinam Karma and Ayukarma are also absent, then the benefit of Moksha is attained, which is full of the indestructible, infinite qualities of happiness, etc. This is the meaning of the Sutra. ||119||

Page #305:
---------------------------
This is the conclusion of the previously mentioned categories of living beings. These living beings are said to be those who are dependent on the body, i.e., those who have a body. Those who are without a body are the Siddhas, the Bhavyas, and the Abhavyas. 

These are all the categories of living beings mentioned earlier. All of them are dependent on the body, except for the Siddhas, who are pure souls without a body.  Since they are dependent on the body, the Samsaris (those who are still in the cycle of birth and death) are of two types: Bhavyas and Abhavyas. They are called Bhavyas and Abhavyas based on whether they have the power to attain their pure form or not.  

The Bhavyas are like a mung bean that can be cooked, and the Abhavyas are like a mung bean that cannot be cooked. The Bhavyas have the power to attain their pure form, while the Abhavyas do not.

Page #306:
---------------------------
The description of the path to liberation through the nine substances:

Continuing the discussion of the nature of living beings, which was previously mentioned, we now explain the difference between worldly and liberated beings by condensing the explanation.

General meaning with analysis: [These] these [living beings] groups of living beings [body knowledge] are said to be those who take refuge in the body, that is, those who act through the body. [Without body] those who are without body are [liberated]. [Worldly] worldly beings are of two types: [worthy] worthy and [unworthy] unworthy.

Specific meaning: If we look at it from the perspective of the definitive principle, all living beings are possessors of the pure self-nature, they are masters of the body of pure consciousness, and they are devoid of bodies born from karma. From the perspective of the practical principle, those who are embodied are worldly, and those who are disembodied are liberated. Liberated beings have attained the pure self directly. Among worldly beings, some are worthy and some are unworthy. Those who possess the power of purification in the form of the manifestation of qualities like pure knowledge are worthy. Those who do not possess the power of purification in the form of manifestation are unworthy. For example, mung beans that are fit for cooking and mung beans that are not fit for cooking, or gold ore and worthless ore. The former has the potential for manifestation of its nature, while the latter does not, although the nature of mung bean and gold is present in both. The power to become pure manifests at the time of accepting right faith in those who possess it. But in those who do not possess that power, it remains eternally impure, as it has been from the beginning.

Thus, the fourth stage is completed, primarily focusing on the explanation of the five senses in the first four verses.

Here, the five senses are the characteristic feature, so it is also important to understand the explanation of one-sense beings, etc., from the section of the verse "tiria bahuppayara" mentioned earlier. This characteristic feature is illustrated with an example. For example, if someone says, "Protect the ghee from crows," it also implies that the ghee should be protected from cats, etc.

This refutes the view that the body is the only characteristic of a living being. For the senses are not the living being, nor are the bodies, which are of six types. What is present in them as knowledge, that is what they consider to be the living being.

Page #307:
---------------------------
The five senses and the six types of bodies, starting with the earth body, are called 'jiva' due to the intermingling of the eternal jiva and pudgala, based on practical usage and giving priority to the jiva. However, in terms of definitive understanding, these senses and bodies are not jivas because they lack the characteristic of consciousness, which is the defining feature of a jiva. The knowledge that shines forth in these senses and bodies, in the form of self-awareness and awareness of others, is what is considered the jiva, due to its subtle non-duality with the qualities and the qualified.

Page #308:
---------------------------
## The Description of the Path to Liberation through the Nine Substances: Pure Certainty

**The Jiva is a collection of infinite qualities such as infinite bliss, etc., which are inherent in pure knowledge, an abstract entity devoid of senses.** This is the meaning. || 121 ||

**This explains the extraordinary actions of the Jiva.** The Jiva knows, sees, desires happiness, fears suffering, performs good and bad actions, and experiences the fruits of both. || 122 ||

**Commentary:** This describes the extraordinary actions of the Jiva, which are distinct from other beings.

Due to its inherent nature of consciousness, the Jiva is the doer of actions, knowledge, and perception. The Pudgala, which is associated with the Jiva, is not the doer, just as space, etc., are not the doer. The Jiva is the doer of actions that arise from the transformation of consciousness, such as the desire for happiness, the fear of suffering, and the performance of actions that are perceived as beneficial or harmful. The Jiva is also the doer of actions that result from the fruits of good and bad karma, such as the enjoyment of pleasant and unpleasant objects, and the experience of happiness and suffering.

Therefore, it is concluded that the Jiva, distinct from the Pudgala, is inferable through these extraordinary actions. || 122 ||

**Translation of the Sanskrit Text:**

The Jiva knows and sees everything, desires happiness, fears suffering, performs good and bad actions, and experiences the fruits of both. The Jiva is the doer of these actions.

**Explanation:**

The text explains that the Jiva is the doer of actions, knowledge, and perception. This is because the Jiva is a conscious entity, and its actions are a result of its consciousness. The Pudgala, which is associated with the Jiva, is not the doer of actions. The Jiva is the doer of actions that arise from its consciousness, such as the desire for happiness, the fear of suffering, and the performance of actions that are perceived as beneficial or harmful. The Jiva is also the doer of actions that result from the fruits of good and bad karma, such as the enjoyment of pleasant and unpleasant objects, and the experience of happiness and suffering.

This text is important because it helps us to understand the nature of the Jiva and its relationship to the Pudgala. It also helps us to understand the nature of karma and its effects on the Jiva.

Page #309:
---------------------------
The existence of the soul is to be known by its extraordinary functions, such as the soul being the doer of the action of desire, which results in happiness, the action of fear, which results in suffering, the action of the agent, which results in the consequences of good and bad, and the action of the experiencer, which results in the experience of the fruits of happiness and suffering.  The act of being a doer is of three types:  unwholesome, wholesome, and pure use.  Or, the soul is the doer of the substance, karma, and knowledge-obscuration, etc., according to the non-conventional, non-real, and practical point of view.  The soul is the doer of the mental karma, which is in the form of passions, etc., according to the impure conviction.  The soul is the doer of the action of transformation into pure states, such as omniscience, etc., according to the pure conviction.  Similarly, the soul is the experiencer in all three points of view.  That is, the soul is the experiencer of the fruits of karma according to the practical point of view, the experiencer of the feeling of "I am happy" and "I am unhappy" according to the impure conviction, and the experiencer of the bliss of the soul according to the pure conviction.  It is said:  "The soul is the doer of the substance, karma, etc., according to the practical point of view, the doer of the consciousness, karma, etc., according to the conviction, and the doer of the pure states according to the pure point of view."  Thus, the fifth section is completed with two independent verses, the first verse describing the extraordinary functions of the soul, and the second verse describing the distinction between the soul and the non-soul.

**Description of the Path to Liberation through the Nine Substances** _Explanation of the Jiva and Ajiva, and an Introduction to the Explanation of Ajiva._

**Verse 123:**
Having thus understood the Jiva through many other synonyms,
Know the Ajiva through the signs that are different from knowledge.

**Explanation:**
Thus, in this way, through the practical approach, the Jiva is understood through many synonyms, which are explained in the Karma Grantha, such as the Jiva's qualities, its state, its path, its attainment of liberation, and so on. Through the definitive approach, the Jiva is understood through many synonyms, which are the forms of consciousness and its transformations, due to the attainment of the universal form, which is the result of the culmination of attachment, aversion, and delusion. Sometimes these synonyms are impure, and sometimes they are pure due to the absence of impurity. Having thus understood the Jiva, which is inherently non-conscious, know the Ajiva, which is connected or unconnected to the Jiva, through the signs that are different from knowledge, which are explained here, for the sake of understanding the difference between the two.

**End of the Explanation of the Jiva.**

**Meaning of the Verse:**
(Thus) in this way, (through many other synonyms) through many other synonyms, (having understood the Jiva) having understood the Jiva, (through the signs that are different from knowledge) through the signs that are different from knowledge, (know the Ajiva) know the Ajiva.

**Commentary:**
This verse concludes the explanation of the Jiva and begins the explanation of the Ajiva. Having thus understood the Jiva, through many other synonyms, know the Ajiva through the signs that are different from knowledge. For example, having understood the Jiva in the way described earlier, through what synonyms? Through the synonyms mentioned earlier. Not only through the synonyms mentioned earlier, but also through the practical approach, through the names that are based on the qualities, the state of the Jiva, its path, its attainment of liberation, and the differences between them, such as the karma that arises from the body, the human body, the structure of the body, and so on, and through the definitive approach, through the impure forms of attachment, aversion, and delusion, and also through the pure forms of the absence of attachment, aversion, and delusion, which are the forms of consciousness and its transformations, which are the essence of the Jiva, which is characterized by the absence of attachment, aversion, and delusion, and which is characterized by the pure, unconditioned, blissful, and eternal nature of consciousness.

**The Five Astikayas and Beyond**

With the thirty-seven **rasanubhava** (taste of experience) **samarasi** (harmonious) **bhavas** (states of being) as the basis, and other pure **bhavas**, what should one do? What should one know? What is the **ajiva** (non-living) substance? What are the **lingas** (signs) or **chinnas** (marks) that distinguish it? The meaning of the sutra is that it should be known through the **jnana** (knowledge) that is different from the **jada** (inert) qualities, which will be explained later. ||123||

Thus, the conclusion of the explanation of the **jiva** (living) substance and the beginning of the explanation of the **ajiva** substance are both contained in this single sutra, marking the completion of the sixth **sthala** (stage).

**Summary:**

As mentioned earlier, there is one independent **gatha** (verse) that names the nine substances, starting with "**jivajiva bhavas**" (living-living states). Following this, there are fifteen **sutras** (aphorisms) in six **sthala** (stages) that explain the **jiva** and other substances. In this way, the second **maha-adhikaran** (major chapter) that explains the nine substances in sixteen **gatha** (verses) is complete, with the completion of the second **antara-adhikaran** (sub-chapter).

**Hindi Translation:**

The **utthanika** (introduction) to the next **gatha** (verse) condenses the explanation of the **jiva** (living) substance, while the next **gatha** (verse) begins the explanation of the **ajiva** (non-living) substance.

**General Meaning with Anvaya (Word Order):**

(Evam) In this way, (annehi vi) by other (bahugehi) many (pajjayehi) synonyms, (jivam) this living being, (abhigamy) understanding, (nanantaridehi) by knowledge different from the inert qualities, (lingehi) by signs, (ajjivam) the non-living principle, (abhigacchadu) know.

**Specific Meaning:**

Previously, the distinctions of one-sense beings, etc., were mentioned. By understanding the distinctions of the living beings through these, then, according to the **vyavahara** (practical) perspective, the distinctions of worldly beings in terms of **guna-sthana** (quality-place), **jiva-sthana** (living being-place), and **marga-na** (path-knowledge), and the distinctions of the living beings' own human, etc., bodies, their structures, and external forms, which arise from the **udaya** (arising) of **nama-karma** (name-action), and the distinctions based on the **ashuddha** (impure) **nishcaya** (certainty) in terms of the impure **bhavas** (states) of **raga** (attachment), **dvesha** (aversion), and **moha** (delusion), and the distinctions based on the **shuddha** (pure) **nishcaya** (certainty) in terms of the **vitraga** (free from attachment) and **vikalpa** (choice)-free **chidananda** (blissful consciousness) nature of the **atma** (soul) substance, which is experienced as the **paramananda** (supreme bliss) and the **sukha-amrita** (nectar of happiness) taste, and the **samarasi** (harmonious) **bhavas** (states) that arise from this experience, and the pure **parinamana** (transformation) distinctions, etc., understand the living beings. After that, know the **ajiva** (non-living) substances through the **jada** (inert) qualities, whose nature will be explained later. This is the meaning of the sutra. ||123||

## Chapter 308: Description of the Path to Liberation, or Explanation of the Non-Living Substance

This is an explanation of the reason why space, etc., are non-living.

**Verse 124:**

* In space, time, matter, merit, and demerit, there are no qualities of a living being.
* Their non-sentience is stated, while the sentience of a living being is stated.

**Explanation:**

* In space, time, matter, merit, and demerit, there are no qualities of a living being in the form of special sentience. This is because space, etc., are generally non-sentient.
* The general non-sentience is only of space, etc., because the general sentience is only of a living being.

**Now, the explanation of the non-living substance.**

**Meaning:**

* (In space, time, matter, merit, and demerit) In space, time, matter, merit, and demerit, (qualities of a living being) there are no qualities of a living being, (because) [their non-sentience is stated] their non-sentience is stated, (the sentience of a living being) the sentience of a living being is stated.

**Commentary:**

* This is a statement of the reason to show that space, etc., are non-living.
* In space, time, matter, merit, and demerit, there are no qualities of a living being in the form of special sentience, because space, etc., are generally non-sentient. And the general non-sentience is only of space, etc., because the general sentience is only of a living being.

**Commentary:**

* Further, the substance of action, the substance of material action, the substance of non-action, and the substance of knowledge, etc., are devoid of the qualities of the state of being, the state of being a human, the state of being a hell-being, etc., and are of the nature of infinite qualities like perfect knowledge, etc., and are included within the nine substances, starting with the living being. They are the ultimate reality, the true reality, and are the essence of pure time. The substance of pure living being, which is to be considered, is explained in four verses, starting from the non-living substance, which is different in nature. In these four verses, the non-living nature is primarily explained in the three verses, starting with "space, time," etc., and then, to differentiate, the pure living being in the body is primarily explained in the verse starting with "tasteless, odorless," etc. Thus, in two places, up to the four verses, the explanation of the non-living substance is a summary. For example, it states the reason for the non-living nature of space, etc., "In space, time, matter, merit, and demerit, there are no qualities of a living being like infinite knowledge, etc., therefore, their non-sentience is stated." Why are there no qualities of a living being in them? The meaning of the verse "because the sentience is only of a living being" is that it encompasses all substances, including the three worlds and the three times.

Page #313:
---------------------------
The text explains the nature of non-living (ajeeva) substances in four verses, contrasting them with the pure living (jeeva) substance, which is characterized by the true and certain knowledge of the five astikayas (categories of existence). The four verses primarily focus on the non-living elements, with terms like 'Aayasakaal' (time) and 'Paat ka Gaara' (earth) being mentioned. To further differentiate, a single verse, starting with "Arsamaruvam," describes the pure living substance within the body. Thus, the text explains the nature of non-living substances through eight verses, concluding with the complete explanation of the community (samudaya).

The Hindi translation explains why space (aakash) and other elements are non-living. The text states that space, time, matter (pudgal), dharma-astikaya, and adharma-astikaya, the five types of non-living substances, lack the specific qualities (guna) of living beings. They are described as being devoid of consciousness (achetan). In contrast, living beings possess consciousness (chetan).

The verse explains that the ability to know all things in the three worlds at one time is the inherent nature of consciousness in living beings. This nature is absent in non-living substances, making them non-conscious. Only living beings are conscious.

The next verse further elaborates on the non-consciousness of space and other elements through an inference. It states that those who lack the ability to experience pleasure and pain, engage in beneficial actions, and fear harmful actions are considered non-living by the ascetics (shramanas).

The commentary clarifies that this verse establishes the general non-consciousness of space and other elements through inference. Since space and other elements lack the specific qualities of consciousness, such as the ability to experience pleasure and pain, engage in beneficial actions, and fear harmful actions, they are considered non-living.

##  310
**Description of the Nine Substances and the Path to Liberation (Moksha) by the Saints**

Having established the non-sentience of space and the other substances, the Sutra now explains the reason for this. 

**The Sutra states:**

"That which does not possess the knowledge of pleasure and pain, nor the inclination towards its own good, nor fear of its own harm, is always called *ajeeva* (non-living) by the Shramanas (ascetics). This is what is being explained.

For the ignorant, things like flowers, garlands, women, sandalwood, etc., are considered beneficial, and they perform acts of charity and worship for them. Similarly, they consider snakes, poison, thorns, etc., as harmful. However, for the enlightened, the ultimate reality, the *paramatma* (supreme soul), which is the essence of the three jewels of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, is considered beneficial. And the *atma* (soul) which is transformed by false beliefs, attachment, etc., and which causes suffering and anxiety, is considered harmful.

Thus, the absence of these specific qualities of consciousness, which are the examination of what is beneficial and harmful, is the reason why space and the other five substances are non-sentient."

**Commentary:**

This Sutra explains the difference between the *jeeva* (living being) and the *pudgala* (matter) by stating that the *jeeva* possesses consciousness, while the *pudgala* does not. The *jeeva* experiences pleasure and pain, and has the capacity to act for its own good or avoid harm. The *pudgala*, on the other hand, is inert and lacks these qualities.

**Further Explanation:**

The Sutra then goes on to describe the characteristics of the *pudgala* in more detail. It states that the *pudgala* is composed of various qualities, such as color, taste, touch, smell, and sound. These qualities are derived from the *pudgala* substance and are subject to change.

The Sutra also states that the *pudgala* is not sentient and does not have the capacity to perceive or experience. It is simply a collection of qualities that are subject to the laws of nature.

**Conclusion:**

The Sutra concludes by emphasizing the difference between the *jeeva* and the *pudgala*. The *jeeva* is a conscious being with the capacity for liberation, while the *pudgala* is inert matter that is subject to the laws of nature.

Page #315:
---------------------------
Know that the **Jiva** is **Alingagrahanam**, **Anirdishtasanstanam**, **Arasam**, **Arupam**, **Agandham**, **Avyaktam**, **Asabdam**, and **Chetanagunam**. ||127||

That which is capable of being perceived by the senses due to its possession of qualities like touch, taste, smell, color, and sound, and due to its transformation into various forms like **sanstanas**, **sanghatas**, etc., is **Pudgaladravyam**. But that which is not capable of being perceived by the senses due to its lack of qualities like touch, taste, smell, color, and sound, and due to its transformation into various forms like **Avyaktam**, **Anirdishtasanstanam**, etc., is **Jivadravyam**, distinct from both **Rupi** and **Arupi** **Ajiva** due to its possession of **Chetanagunam**. Thus, the real difference between **Jiva** and **Ajiva** is explained here for the sake of making the path of **Samyagjnani** clear. ||126-127||

Thus ends the explanation of the **Ajiva** substance.  _San. Ta.- Although **Sanstanas** etc., which are **Pudgala** transformations, exist along with **Jiva** like milk and water, they are certainly not the essence of **Jiva**. This is the knowledge of the difference. - **Samchaturasra** etc., six **Sanstanas** are related to the body like **Audarika** etc., five **Sanghatas** are **varna**, **rasa**, **sparsa**, **gandha**, and **sabda**. These are all born from **Pudgaladravyam** because they are certainly different from the **Paramatma** substance which is devoid of **Sanstanas** etc., **Pudgala** transformations, and is endowed with the four infinite qualities like **Kevalajnanam** etc. In the question of which are qualities and which are transformations among these, the answer is - **varna**, **rasa**, **sparsa**, and **gandha** are qualities, while **Sanstanas** etc., are transformations.

Page #316:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Verse 126:**

The meaning of the sutra is that there are many descriptions of the nine substances and the path to liberation.

**Commentary:**

The first section of the text has already discussed the non-living nature of the five substances, including pudgala, using three verses.

Now, in response to the question, "If formations (sanstthana) and other things are not the nature of the soul, then what is the nature of the soul?", the text explains:

* The soul is not the substance of pudgala, which has the qualities of taste (rasa) and other qualities.
* It is not merely the qualities of taste.
* It is not the sense organ of the tongue, which is made of pudgala and is called "jihvendraiya".
* It is not the object of perception, which has the quality of taste, and is perceived by the tongue sense organ.
* It is not the perceiver, the sense organ itself, which perceives taste.
* It is not the mind (bhaavendraiya), which perceives the taste and removes the karmas.
* It is not the knowledge (kevalgyaan) that is a single, undivided awareness of all objects of perception, which is born from the mind (bhaavendraiya) and is the cause of the knowledge of taste.
* It is not the knowledge of taste, which is a part of the knowledge of all objects of perception.
* It is not the soul that knows the taste and becomes one with it.

Therefore, the soul is tasteless (arasa).

This explanation should be applied to the other senses, such as sight, smell, sound, and touch, in a similar way.

**Verse 127:**

**Commentary:**

* **Avyakta:** Just as the cycle of karmas, such as anger, etc., is not present in the pure soul, which is free from the perception of the false, attachment, etc., and is not manifested in the impure soul, similarly, the Supreme Soul is not manifested in the impure soul.
* **Asanstthana:** The Supreme Soul is not formed by the six formations (samchaturstra, etc.) that arise from the karmas of pudgala, because it is a single, undivided awareness, free from all formations, including the four-sided formation (vritta-chaturstra), etc.
* **Alingagrahan:** Although the pure soul is known indirectly through inference, characteristics, indirect knowledge, and conventional understanding, like knowing fire from smoke, it is not directly perceived by others, as it is perceived by the perfect yogis, who are free from the defilements of attachment, etc., and whose pure soul is directly perceived by them. Their pure soul is filled with the nectar of true happiness, like a pot filled with water, and is free from all anxieties.

**Meaning:**

The soul is pure consciousness (shuddha chetana guna) and has the quality of knowledge (kevalgyaan), as described in the verse: "He who knows all moving and non-moving things, all their qualities, and all their transformations, past, present, and future, at every moment, is called the omniscient. Salutations to the omniscient, the Lord of the Jinas, the great hero."

**Conclusion:**

This section of the text explains the nature of the pure soul, which is free from all defilements and is the ultimate goal of liberation. It also emphasizes the importance of understanding the difference between the pure soul and the impure soul.

This section concludes the second major chapter, which deals with the nine substances, and the third sub-chapter within it.

Page #317:
---------------------------
The five Astikayas, beginning with the Panchaastikaya, are the five fundamental substances in Jain cosmology. These five substances are:

1. **Pudgala** (matter)
2. **Jiva** (soul)
3. **Akasha** (space)
4. **Kala** (time)
5. **Dharma** (principle of motion)

The text states that the five Astikayas are **ajiva** (non-living) and that they are distinct from the **Atman** (soul). The Atman is described as being devoid of the qualities of **Pudgala**, such as **varna** (color), **rasa** (taste), **sparsa** (touch), and **gandha** (smell). It is also described as being **kevalajnana** (omniscient) and possessing **anant chatushtaya** (infinite qualities).

The text then goes on to describe the nature of the **Jiva** (soul). It states that the Jiva is **arasa** (devoid of taste), **arupa** (devoid of color), **agandha** (devoid of smell), **ayatta** (unmanifest), **asai** (devoid of sound), **chedanaguna** (possessing the quality of consciousness), **alingaggrahan** (not capable of being perceived by the senses), and **anittihsanthan** (not possessing a specific form).

The text further clarifies that the Jiva is not **Pudgala** or any of its qualities, nor is it a **dravyaindriya** (sense organ) like the **jihwa** (tongue). It also states that the Jiva is not capable of being perceived by the senses, nor does it perceive the world through the senses. The Jiva's knowledge is **kevalajnana** (omniscient) and is not dependent on the senses.

The text concludes by stating that the Jiva is not **bhavaindriya** (the sense organ of feeling) and that it does not perceive the world through the sense of feeling. The Jiva's knowledge is **kevalajnana** (omniscient) and is not dependent on the sense of feeling.

The living being is subtle because it is described as the path to liberation by the nine substances. In the same way, this living being is devoid of color, smell, sound, and touch. In these too, like rasa, it is appropriate to understand the all-encompassing explanation. And just as the fourfold of anger, pride, deceit, and greed, which lead to false belief and attachment, etc., do not appear to living beings devoid of the attainment of the pure self-nature, so too, this supreme self-nature does not appear to them. Therefore, it is unmanifest. This living being is certainly the undivided, luminous, supreme self-nature, devoid of the six bodies, such as the equal-four-sided, etc., in their formation or shape. Therefore, it does not have the six bodies, such as the equal-four-sided, etc., obtained from the pulsating karma. Therefore, this living being is devoid of bodies. And just as the impure soul is recognized by the practical method through indirect knowledge, which is in the form of inference, in the same way that fire is inferred from smoke, so too, this pure soul, although devoid of attachments, etc., is directly perceived by perfect yogis, who are fully established in the supreme bliss, which is free from all anxieties, arising from self-awareness, and is like a full pitcher of the nectar of true happiness. However, it is not directly experienced by those who are not such yogis. Therefore, this living being is "unperceived by the senses." And this living being is endowed with the pure consciousness quality, which is the knowledge of the self, and therefore is in the form of consciousness, as stated in the verse: "He who knows all movable and immovable, diverse substances, their qualities, their past, future, and present states, in all ways, always, simultaneously, every moment, is called the omniscient. To that omniscient, the Jinesvara, and the great hero, the Lord, be salutations." O disciple! Know that this pure living being substance, which is endowed with the pure consciousness quality called "knowledge of the self," is distinct from these qualities, as stated in the verse. || 127 ||

In this way, the second section, which explains the nine substances in two sections, in four verses, was completed with the second section, which speaks of the pure living being, which is capable of being perceived in all ways, for the sake of understanding the difference.

The above-mentioned fundamental substances. Now, for the sake of introducing the other seven substances, which are produced by the combination and transformation, the cycle of living being, matter, and karma is described.

The living being, who is the object of the world, is the cause of transformation. From transformation comes karma, and from karma comes the state of existence. || 128 ||

Page #319:
---------------------------
From the attainment of the **gati** (state of existence), the body and the sense organs arise. From these, the grasping of objects occurs, and from that, either attachment (raga) or aversion (dvesha) arises. Thus, the state of the living being is born, revolving in the wheel of samsara (cycle of birth and death). This is what the **Jina** (Tirthankara) has said, that it is without beginning (anadinidhana) or with an end (sanidhana). 

This is because, due to the influence of the **upaadhi** (limiting conditions) of the bond of the living being in samsara, there is a continuous flow of **parinaama** (transformation). From this **parinaama**, **karma** (action) arises, which is of the nature of **pudhgala** (matter) transformation. From **karma**, there is movement in the **gati** (states of existence) like hell, etc. From the attainment of the **gati**, the body arises. From the body, the sense organs arise. From the sense organs, the grasping of objects occurs. From the grasping of objects, attachment and aversion arise. From attachment and aversion, again, there is a continuous flow of **parinaama**. From this **parinaama**, again, **karma** arises, which is of the nature of **pudhgala** transformation. From **karma**, again, there is movement in the **gati** (states of existence) like hell, etc. From the attainment of the **gati**, again, the body arises. From the body, again, the sense organs arise. From the sense organs, again, the grasping of objects occurs. From the grasping of objects, again, attachment and aversion arise. From attachment and aversion, again, there is a continuous flow of **parinaama**. Thus, this network of **karma**, which is of the nature of the transformation of the living being and **pudhgala**, being mutually cause and effect, revolves like a wheel in the cycle of samsara, without beginning (anadinidhana) or with an end (sanidhana). In this, the **parinaama** of the living being is caused by the **pudhgala** transformation, and the **pudhgala** transformation is caused by the **parinaama** of the living being, which should be understood as the seed of the objects to be explained later.

##  Navapadartha - Mokshamarg Varnan

**Commentary:** In this world, due to the influence of the endless bondage-like upadhikās, the worldly being experiences a continuous cycle of snigdha parināma. From parināma arises karma, which is made up of pudgala parināma. Karma leads to the attainment of gati, which in turn leads to the acquisition of a body. From the body arise the indriyas, which then lead to the perception of objects. This perception of objects gives rise to raga and dvesha, which again lead to snigdha parināma. This cycle continues endlessly, with parināma leading to karma, karma leading to gati, and so on. In this way, the interconnected cause-and-effect relationship between the jiva parināma and the pudgala parināma-based karma binds the jiva in the cycle of samsara, causing it to endlessly revolve like a wheel.

Therefore, it is said that the jiva parināma, which is the cause of pudgala parināma, and the pudgala parināma, which is the cause of jiva parināma, are the seeds of the seven substances (punya, papa, etc.) that will be discussed later. || 128-130 ||

**Commentary:** If the dravya is completely parināmit, then there is only one substance, which is the parināma of the combination of jiva and pudgala. Or, if the dravya is completely aparināmit, then there are only two substances, the pure jiva and the pure pudgala. There is no occurrence of punya, papa, etc., so what is the fault? The absence of bondage and liberation is the fault, and to eliminate this fault, parināma and aparināma are completely negated. If this negation is accepted, then how can there be parināma? And if there is no parināma, then how can the seven substances occur? The student asks: Even if there is some parināma, and the seven substances of punya, etc., occur, their purpose is fulfilled only by the jiva and ajīva, because they are just different forms of the jiva and ajīva.

**Response:** The purpose of mentioning these seven substances is to show the nature of the desirable and undesirable for the bhavyas. This is what is being said: Suffering is undesirable, and its cause is samsara. The cause of samsara is the bondage-related substances, and their cause is the triad of mithyadarshana, mithyajnana, and mithyacharita. Therefore, happiness is desirable, and its cause is liberation. The cause of liberation is the pair of samvara and nirjara. And their cause is the triad of samyagdarshana, samyagjnana, and samyacharita. Thus, the two substances of jiva and ajīva, which were mentioned earlier, and the seven substances of punya, etc., which will be discussed later, together constitute the nine substances. This concludes the section on the establishment of the nine substances.

**Further:** From now on, the combination-parināma of jiva and pudgala, which was established earlier based on the power of some parināma, should be understood as the cause and seed of the seven substances of punya, etc., which will be discussed later. In the fourth chapter of the Pātanikā, it is said: "The jiva who is in samsara experiences parināma. From parināma arises new karma. From karma arises gati in the gatis. This is the first verse. The one who has attained gati acquires a body. From the body arise the indriyas. From the indriyas arises the perception of objects. From this arises raga and dvesha. This is the second verse. Thus, the jiva experiences delusion and wandering. Where? In the cycle of samsara. What is its special characteristic? It is described by the Jina Virs. What is its further special characteristic? It is endless and without beginning or end, in comparison to the abhavyas and bhavyas. This is the third verse. For example, although this jiva is inherently pure and has the nature of pure knowledge and vision, due to the bondage of endless karma, it experiences impure parināma, which is characterized by atmasamvitti. From this parināma arises karma, which covers the inherent nature of the jiva, which is characterized by infinite knowledge, etc., and binds the jiva with pudgalika karma, such as jnanaavarana, etc."

Page #321:
---------------------------
The five astikayas, beginning with the first, are the five types of happiness, which are different from the happiness of the five senses. These five astikayas are the cause of the four types of births, namely, the births of gods, humans, animals, and hell beings. After these births, the body, which is opposite to the soul, which is pure consciousness and bliss, is born. Then, from the soul, which is the form of the supreme self, the senses, which are opposite to the soul, are born. From these senses, the happiness of the five senses, which is opposite to the pure bliss of the soul, which is born from the meditation of the pure soul without any object, is born. Then, from the soul, which is the abode of infinite knowledge and other virtues, which is free from the defects of attachment, aversion, and delusion, attachment and aversion are born. From the attachment and aversion, which are the cause of the karma, which is the effect, the karma is born. This is the cause and effect relationship between the attachment, aversion, and karma. This is the cause of the auspicious and inauspicious things, which will be discussed later. Therefore, to destroy the cycle of birth and death, one should meditate on the soul, which is the form of the group of infinite auspicious virtues, and abandon the thoughts of the world, like the sky.

Furthermore, a knowledgeable soul, who has attained the knowledge of truth, becomes the doer of the inauspicious things, the bondage, and the flow, even though he is free from the modifications of the soul. Sometimes, due to the rise of delusion, he becomes the doer of the auspicious things, which are the result of the inauspicious things, because of the desire for the objects of enjoyment, which are seen, heard, and experienced. However, a knowledgeable soul, who has attained the knowledge of truth, becomes the doer of the restraint, the flow, and the liberation, because of the three jewels of non-duality, which are the taste, the perception, and the unshakeable experience, which are in the soul. When he is unable to remain in the three jewels of non-duality, he becomes the doer of the auspicious things, which are the cause of the destruction of the cycle of birth and death, because of the unwavering devotion to the supreme self, which is free from defects, and the teachers, the preceptors, and the saints, who are the followers of the supreme self. This is the cause of the destruction of the cycle of birth and death and the cause of liberation. This is the auspicious thing, which is the result of the auspicious things, which are the result of the Tirthankaras and other auspicious things, which is free from the cause of the result. In this way, an ignorant soul becomes the doer of the four inauspicious things, while a knowledgeable soul becomes the doer of the three auspicious things. This is the meaning.

Thus, the second great chapter, which explains the nine things, ends with the fourth chapter, which states that the seven things, namely, the auspicious, the inauspicious, and the five astikayas, are the result of the combination and separation of the soul and the matter.

**Preface:** If someone doubts that the soul becomes one with the matter in all ways, then the soul and the matter are one thing, which is the result of the combination. Or, if someone doubts that both the soul and the matter are pure and free from all modifications, then the auspicious and inauspicious things are not real. Then, there will be no bondage or liberation. To remove this doubt, one should know that both the soul and the matter are neither modifiable nor unmodifiable. Therefore, both are modifiable in relation to something. Only then, the seven things, namely, the support, the object, the knowledge, the faith, the conduct, the power, and the liberation, can be established. Then, the disciple said, "Even though the seven things are established because of the modifiability of the soul and the matter in relation to something, they are useless. The soul and the non-soul are enough, because the seven things are just synonyms of the soul and the matter." The teacher replied, "To show the nature of the things that should be abandoned and the things that should be accepted by the aspiring souls, the seven things are explained."

##  Description of the Path to Liberation (Moksha) through the Nine Substances (Navapadaartha)

The statement of the substances is presented here. The principle that is worthy of being abandoned is suffering (duhkha). The cause of suffering is the world (samsara). The causes of the world are the binding substances (astrava) and the binding (bandha). The causes of these binding substances and binding are false perception (mithyadarshan), false knowledge (mithyagyan), and false conduct (mithyacharitra). The principle that is worthy of being embraced is happiness (sukha). Its cause is liberation (moksha). The causes of liberation are restraint (samvara) and shedding (nirjara). The causes of these two are right perception (samyagdarshan), right knowledge (samyagyan), and right conduct (samyakcharitra). In this way, taking the two substances of the living being (jiva) and the non-living (ajiva) mentioned earlier, along with the seven substances of merit (punya), demerit (papa), etc., that are worthy of being discussed further, they all come together to form the nine substances of the community (samudaya). In this way, the establishment of the nine substances (navapadaartha) chapter is complete.

##  Hindi Translation (Uttanika)

What follows is the explanation of how the living being (jiva) and the non-living (puhl) are considered to have the power of transformation (parinaman shakti) and how their combination (sanyog) is established. This combination is the cause or seed (beeja) of the seven substances of merit (punya), demerit (papa), etc., that are worthy of being discussed further. This is explained in three verses.

##  General Meaning with Anvaya (Grammatical Analysis)

(Khlu) Truly, (jo) whoever (sansarattha) wanders in the world (jiva) is an impure soul (tatto) from that (du) itself (parinamo) impure state (hodi) arises. (Parinamaado) From the impure state (kammam) the binding of karma occurs. (Kammaado) From the arising of those karmas (gadisu gadi) some state (hodi) arises from the four states of existence (gadin) the state (adhigadassa) attained by the living being (deho) has a gross body (dehaado) from the body (indiyaani) the senses (jayante) are born. (Tehi du) From those senses themselves (vishayaggrahanam) the reception of objects of sense like touch, etc., occurs. (Tatto) From the reception of that object (rago cha doso va) attachment (raga) or aversion (dosha) arises. (Evam) In this way (sansarachakkavalammi) in the rotation of this wheel of the world (jivassa) the state (bhavo) of the living being (jayade) continues to arise. (Idi) Thus (jinavarehi) the Jina (Jineendradev) has (bhanido) said. This state (anadinighano) is without beginning (anadi) and infinite (anant) in duration with respect to the non-virtuous (abhavya). (Sanighano va) And with respect to the virtuous (bhavya) it is without beginning (anadi) but also has an end.

##  Specific Meaning

Although this living being (jiva) is inherently pure (nishchayanya) and possesses the nature of pure knowledge (vishuddha jnana) and perception (darshan), yet in practical terms (vyavharanaya), due to being bound by karma since time immemorial (anadikal), this living being experiences (anubhavagochar) an impure state (ashuddha bhavo). From this impure state (ashuddha bhavo), it binds (bandhata) the karmas of knowledge-obscuring (jnanaavaran), etc., which are made of matter (pudgal) and which cover the nature of the soul (atma) that is free from karma (karmase rahita) and possesses infinite knowledge (anantagyana), etc. From the arising (udaya) of these karmas, the soul (atma) is separated from the happiness (sukha) of the fifth state of existence (panchamagati) - liberation (moksha) - and is born into the states of gods (dev), humans (manushya), etc.

---------------------------
The soul, which is naturally pure consciousness and bliss, transmigrates through the four states of existence: the five senses, the 319 hells, the animal realm, and the human realm. In these states, it acquires a gross body, which is contrary to its true nature. This body gives rise to senses that are opposed to the pure, transcendental, and subtle nature of the soul. These senses lead to the enjoyment of worldly pleasures, which are contrary to the pure bliss that arises from the contemplation of the soul, free from the objects of the five senses. This leads to the development of attachment and aversion, which are contrary to the infinite knowledge and other virtues that are inherent in the soul. Attachment and aversion lead to the binding of karma, which is similar to the karma bound in the past. This cycle of attachment, aversion, and karma is the cause of the seven substances: merit, demerit, etc., which will be discussed later. To break this cycle of samsara, one should cultivate the infinite bliss and other virtues that are inherent in the soul, by abandoning attachment and aversion.

The ignorant soul, being subject to change, does not realize its true nature, which is free from all defilements. It becomes the doer of demerit, inflow, and bondage. Sometimes, due to the influence of subtle false belief, it also becomes the doer of merit, which is the cause of future demerit, due to the binding of desire for the objects of the senses. However, the wise soul, through the three jewels of faith, knowledge, and conduct, becomes the doer of restraint, purification, and liberation. When unable to abide in the three jewels of non-duality, certainty, and the three jewels, it engages in complete and special devotion to the perfect and supreme soul, the liberated ones, and their followers: the teachers, the preceptors, and the monks. This leads to the binding of special merits, such as the nature of the Tirthankaras, which are the cause of liberation and the destruction of samsara. This binding of merit is the cause of future merit, making the wise soul the doer of merit. Thus, the ignorant soul is the doer of demerit, merit, inflow, and bondage, while the wise soul is the doer of restraint, purification, and liberation.

This concludes the fourth chapter, which mainly discusses the seven substances: merit, demerit, etc., which arise from the combination and separation of the soul and matter. This chapter is divided into three sections, which explain these seven substances.

Now, we will discuss the substance of merit and demerit.

**Description of the Nine Substances and the Path to Liberation**

**_Punyakarma and Papkarma are the causes of attachment, and from this attachment arise delusion, anger, hatred, and mental clarity.  The result for one who has these is either auspicious or inauspicious._**

**_Delusion, anger, hatred, or mental clarity, whichever exists in one's being, results in either auspicious or inauspicious consequences._**

Here, delusion is the result of the karmic consequences of the delusion of perception.  Anger and hatred are the pleasure and displeasure that arise from the karmic consequences of the delusion of conduct.  Mental clarity is the pure result of the subtle arising of the delusion of conduct.  Thus, whoever has these (delusion, anger, hatred, or mental clarity) will inevitably have auspicious or inauspicious consequences.  Where there is praiseworthy anger and mental clarity, there is an auspicious consequence.  Where there is delusion, hatred, and unpraiseworthy anger, there is an inauspicious consequence.

**_Now, an explanation of the substances of Punyakarma and Papkarma._**

**Meaning of the Verse:**  (In whose being) in the being of one who (has delusion) delusion, (anger) anger, (hatred) hatred, (or) or (mental clarity) mental clarity (exists) exists, (for him) for him (auspicious or inauspicious) auspicious or inauspicious (consequences) consequences (happen) happen.

**Commentary:** This is a statement of the nature (essence) of the appropriate states of being for Punyakarma and Papkarma.

Here, delusion is the polluted consequence of the karmic consequences of the delusion of perception.  Anger and hatred are the pleasure and displeasure that arise from the karmic consequences of the delusion of conduct.  Mental clarity is the pure result of the subtle arising of the delusion of conduct.  Thus, whoever has these (delusion, anger, hatred, or mental clarity) will inevitably have auspicious or inauspicious consequences.  Where there is praiseworthy anger and mental clarity, there is an auspicious consequence.  Where there is delusion, hatred, and unpraiseworthy anger, there is an inauspicious consequence.

**Summary:**  This is a four-verse chapter on the topic of Punyakarma and Papkarma.  The first verse, "Moho va ragadoasa" etc., is primarily about the indication of the pure nature of the Supreme Bliss.  The second verse, "Suhaparinaamo" etc., is primarily about the explanation of the two substances of Punyakarma and Papkarma, which are the objects of destruction, from the pure nature of the pure intellect.  The third verse, "Jahma kammassa phala" etc., is primarily about the affirmation of the corporeality of the two substances of Punyakarma and Papkarma, in order to refute the Naiyayika view.  The fourth verse, "Muttho pasadi" etc., is primarily about establishing the contact and binding of the two karmas, the ancient and the recent, in order to establish the purity of the non-corporeal soul, and to show that the soul, in relation to the ancient chain of binding, is considered corporeal in the conventional sense, and to show the binding of corporeal karma with the corporeal soul.  Thus, these four verses are the essence of the fifth chapter.  For example,

##  The Nature of Puny (Merit) and Papa (Demerit)

**Pancastikaya Prabhrit**

321. Now, the nature of Puny (merit) and Papa (demerit) is explained:  For a Jiva (soul) who has Moha (delusion), Raga (attachment), Dvesha (aversion), or Chittaprasada (mental tranquility) in its Bhava (state of being) or Manas (mind), its Parinam (consequence) will be either Shubha (auspicious) or Ashubha (inauspicious).

**Details:**

* When Darshanmoha (delusion in perception) arises, the Jiva lacks the taste for the true nature of the self (Nischya Shuddhatma) and the three jewels of conduct (Vyavahar Ratna Tray). The resulting consequence is Darshanmoha.
* When the Jiva experiences Vichitracharitramoha (delusion in conduct), it lacks the true understanding of the nature of the self (Nischya Vitaraga Charitra) and the conduct of vows (Vyavahar Vratadi). The resulting consequences are Raga (attachment) and Dvesha (aversion) towards the desirable and undesirable.
* When the Jiva experiences a mild form of Moha (delusion), it experiences Chittaprasada (mental tranquility).

**Summary:**

* Moha (delusion) and Dvesha (aversion) are Ashubha (inauspicious).
* Raga (attachment) towards undesirable objects is Ashubha (inauspicious).
* Raga (attachment) towards desirable objects like charity, worship, and vows is Shubha (auspicious).
* Chittaprasada (mental tranquility) is Shubha (auspicious).

This is the meaning of the Sutra. || 131 ||

**Explanation:**

This section discusses the nature of Puny (merit) and Papa (demerit) in a single Sutra.

**Further Explanation:**

The following four verses discuss Puny (merit) and Papa (demerit) in detail.

* The first verse states that the Bhavas (states of being) that are conducive to Puny (merit) or Papa (demerit) are different from the pure soul (Shuddhatma) which is characterized by infinite bliss.
* The second verse explains that Puny (merit) and Papa (demerit) are not the true nature of the soul (Shuddhatma) but are rather temporary states of being that need to be overcome.
* The third verse refutes the Nyaya school of thought which considers both Puny (merit) and Papa (demerit) as material entities.
* The fourth verse explains that the Jiva (soul) and Karma (action) are inseparable and have been bound together since time immemorial. Although the Jiva (soul) is inherently immaterial, it is considered material in a practical sense due to its long-standing association with Karma (action). This association leads to the binding of the Jiva (soul) with Karma (action).

These four verses complete the discussion on Puny (merit) and Papa (demerit) in the fifth chapter of the Pancastikaya.

**Hindi Translation:**

**Uttanika:** Now, the nature of Bhavas (states of being) that are conducive to Puny (merit) and Papa (demerit) is explained.

**Anvaya Sahit Samanyarth:** (Ass) The Jiva (soul) (Bhavammi) whose Bhava (state of being) has (Moho) delusion, (Rago) attachment, (Dosho) aversion, and (Chittaprasado) mental tranquility (Viddidi) is present, (Tass) that Jiva (Suho) will experience auspicious (Va) or (Asuho) inauspicious (Va) (Parinamo) consequences.

**Vishesharth:** When Darshanmoha (delusion in perception) arises due to Karma (action), the Jiva lacks the taste for the true nature of the self (Nischya Shuddhatma) and the three jewels of conduct (Vyavahar Ratna Tray). Such a Jiva is considered to be an external soul (Bahiratma).

## Navpadartha - Mokshamarg Varnan

The opposite result that occurs within is called Darshanmoha or Moha.  As the various types of Charitra Moha arise in the same soul, there is neither a definite Vitaraga Charitra nor the results of Vyavahar Vratas etc.  Within such a being, there is Raga, which is the feeling of liking for desirable objects, and Dvesha, which is the feeling of disliking for undesirable objects.  The subtle manifestation of that same Moha, which is the purification of the mind, is called Chittaprasad.  Here, the meaning of the Sutra is that Moha and Dvesha, and the Ashubha Raga for objects etc., are Ashubha Bhavas, and the Shubha Raga or the delight of the mind, in the form of Dana, Puja, Vratas, Sheela etc., are Shubha Bhavas. || 131 ||

Thus, the first section is complete with one Sutra, describing the Shubha and Ashubha results.

**Punyapapaswaroopaakhyanametat.**

**Suha-parinaamo punnam asuho paavam ti havadhi jivassa.**

**Doham poggal metto bhaavo kammattanam patto.** || 132 ||

**Shubhaparinaamah punyamashubhah paapamiti bhavathi jeeva. Dwayoh pudgalamatrah bhavah karmtavampraptah.** || 132 ||

The Shubhaparinaama, which has become the definite Karma of the Jeeva, is the cause of Dravyapunya, only as a cause, and therefore, after the Asrava of Dravyapunya, it becomes Bhava punya.  Similarly, the Ashubhaparinaama, which has become the definite Karma of the Jeeva, is the cause of Dravypaapa, only as a cause, and therefore, after the Asrava of Dravypaapa, it becomes Bhavapaapa.  The Vishishtprakruttirupa parinaama, which has become the definite Karma of the Pudgala, is the cause of Dravyapunya, due to the Shubhaparinaama of the Jeeva.  The Vishishtprakruttirupa parinaama, which has become the definite Karma of the Pudgala, is the cause of Dravypaapa, due to the Ashubhaparinaama of the Jeeva.  Thus, through Vyavahar and Nishchay, the Karma of the soul, both Murta and Amurta, is known. || 132 ||

**Anvayarth (Jeevasya) Jeevake (Shubhaparinaamah) Shubhaparinaama (punyam) punya hain aur (ashubhah) Ashubhaparinaama (paapamiti bhavathi) paapa hain (dwayoh) un dono ke dwara (pudgalamatrah bhavah) pudgalamatrah bhavah (karmtavampraptah) karm pane ko prapt hote hain.**

**Teeka - This is the statement of the nature of punya and paapa.**

The Shubhaparinaama, which is the definite Karma of the Jeeva, is the cause of Dravyapunya, only as a cause.  Therefore, before the Asrava of Dravyapunya, they are Shubhaparinaama, which become Bhava punya.  Similarly, the Ashubhaparinaama, which is the definite Karma of the Jeeva, is the cause of Dravypaapa, only as a cause.  Therefore, before the Asrava of Dravypaapa, they are Ashubhaparinaama, which become Bhavapaapa.

The Vishishtprakruttirupa parinaama, which is the definite Karma of the Pudgala, is the cause of Dravyapunya, due to the Shubhaparinaama of the Jeeva.  The Vishishtprakruttirupa parinaama, which is the definite Karma of the Pudgala, is the cause of Dravypaapa, due to the Ashubhaparinaama of the Jeeva.  Thus, through Vyavahar and Nishchay, the Karma of the soul, both Murta and Amurta, is known. || 132 ||

Page #327:
---------------------------
The **five-fold** (Panchaastikaya) **karma** (Praabhrut 323 parinaam) which are the cause of auspicious results for the soul are **dravya punya**. The **karma** (asataavedaniyaadi vishist prakriti roop parinaam) which are the cause of inauspicious results for the soul are **dravya paap**. 

Thus, **karma** is described as **moort** (tangible) and **amoort** (intangible) for the soul through **vyavhaar** (conduct) and **nishchay** (certainty).

Navapadartha - Mokshamarg Varnan

In this way, the explanation of the dravya, which is worthy of being renounced, and the punya and papa, which are in the form of bhava, different from the pure soul, which has pure buddhi svabhava, ended from one sutra to another place.
This is the support of the moort karma.
Because the fruit of karma is enjoyed by the jiva through the senses, karma is moort.
Anvayaartha - (Yasmat) because (karma nah phal) the fruit of karma (vishay) which (moort) is the object (niyatam) by rule (sparshai) (moort aisi) by the senses of touch etc. (jivena) by the jiva (sukha dukha) in the form of happiness or in the form of sorrow (bhujyate) is enjoyed, (tasmat) therefore (karmaani) karma (moortani) is moort.
Tika - This is the support of moort karma.
The object, which is the fruit of karma and the cause of happiness and sorrow, is moort by rule and is enjoyed by the jiva through the moort senses, therefore the moortness of karma is inferred. Just as - moort karma, because it is moort, is experienced through its connection with the moort fruit, like poison.
San. Ta. - Now, the moortness of karma is established, Jahma - Yasmat karanat kammas phal - the fruit of karma which has arisen. What kind of fruit is it? Visayam - moort panchendriya vishay roop, bhujjade - bhujyate, niyadam - nischit. By whom, the doer? Jivena - by the jiva, who has transcended the objects and has arisen the bliss of the supreme soul, the taste of nectar, and is not subject to change. By what causes? Phaasehi - by the senses of touch etc., which are moort, opposite to the pure soul, which is without the senses of touch etc. Again, what kind of fruit of karma is it, which is the object of the five senses? Suha dukha - happiness and sorrow, although they are amoort in pure knowledge, but because they are opposite to the supreme bliss, which is the characteristic of the knowledge of the true nature, they are moort happiness and sorrow in the form of joy and sorrow. Tahya moortani karmaani - because, as mentioned earlier, it is enjoyed by the moort senses, which are in the form of the five senses of touch etc., and because the karma itself is moort, in the form of happiness and sorrow, it is seen, therefore, it is known by the inference of the effect, that karma is moort, because the effect is similar to the cause.
Thus, the third place has been reached in one sutra, in the form of the support of the moortness of punya and papa, by the division of the nayas, for the purpose of informing the disciples who follow the Nyaya school of thought.

Page #329:
---------------------------
The five astikayas, starting with the Hindi Ta-utthanika, prove that these dravyakarmas are murtik.

**General Meaning with Anvaya:** (Because) [jivena] by this jiva, [kammassa phalam] the fruit of karma, [suh dukkham], happiness and sorrow, [visayam] which is the object of the five senses, [niyadam] definitely [phasehin] by means of the senses of touch etc., [bhunjade] is enjoyed, [tamha] therefore, [kammani] dravyakarmas [muttani] are murtik.

**Specific Meaning:** The jiva who has fallen from the taste of the blissful nectar born from the contemplation of the Supreme Being devoid of objects, experiences the fruit of the karmas obtained upon coming into existence. That karmic fruit is murtik, being the object of the five senses and is full of happiness and sorrow in the form of joy and sorrow. Although it is amurtik in pure certainty, it is murtik in the form of happiness and sorrow of the objects, due to being opposite to the certain happiness which is amurtik in the ultimate sense and is characterized by supreme bliss, because it is enjoyed by the murtik senses of touch etc., which are opposite to the amurtik pure soul essence, which is definitely devoid of the five senses of touch etc. Therefore, karmas, whose functions are these happiness and sorrow, are also murtik, because the function is similar to the cause. The cause is also known to be murtik from the murtik function-like experience. The objects of the five senses, such as touch etc., are murtik. And they are enjoyed by the murtik senses, happiness and sorrow arise from them, which is also murtik itself. In this way, karma has been proved to be murtik, this is the meaning of the sutra.

In this way, the third place was completed with one sutra, proving both types of dravyakarmas, punya and papa, to be murtik, using the division of nayas to explain to the disciple who relies on the Nyaya view.

**Sutra 134:**
The murtikarma binds the amurtik jiva, and the murtikarma is also bound by the murtikarma. Just as a mud-ball sticks to a mud-ball, the jiva, devoid of murti, is caught by them and is bound by them.

**Explanation:**
In this samsari jiva, the murtik karma continues from the beginningless lineage. Because it has touch etc., the incoming murtik karma touches it, and then that murtik karma experiences bondage with it due to the quality of affection. This is the type of bondage of the murtik karma.

##  Chapter 326: Description of the Path to Liberation through the Nine Substances

**A definitive explanation:** The formless soul, being inherently pure but tainted by the karmic effects of attachment and other passions, is specifically drawn to material karmas. It is also specifically drawn to material karmas by the karmic effects of its own transformations, which are obtained through material karmas. This is the nature of the mutual entanglement of the soul and material karmas. Thus, even the formless soul is not free from entanglement with material karmas, whether they are virtuous or vicious.

**Commentary:** This explains the nature of the entanglement of material karmas with each other, and the entanglement of the formless soul with material karmas.

In this world, material karmas, which have been flowing continuously since the beginning of time, are present. Because they are material, they come into contact with other material karmas, and thus the soul, being attracted to them, becomes entangled with them. This is the nature of the entanglement of the soul with material karmas.

Furthermore, the formless soul, being inherently pure but tainted by the karmic effects of attachment and other passions, is specifically drawn to material karmas. It is also specifically drawn to material karmas by the karmic effects of its own transformations, which are obtained through material karmas. This is the nature of the mutual entanglement of the soul and material karmas. Thus, even the formless soul is not free from entanglement with material karmas, whether they are virtuous or vicious.

**End of the explanation of the substances of virtue and vice.**

Page #331:
---------------------------
Panchastikaya Prabhrita

The mode of bondage of the corporeal karmas is to be known as follows: The corporeal karmas, by means of their own smooth and rough transformations, experience a binding in the form of an association. Now, again, the bondage of the corporeal living being and the corporeal karmas is described. The soul, devoid of liberation, is, according to the absolute point of view, non-corporeal, but due to the influence of the beginningless karmic bondage, it becomes corporeal in the empirical point of view. What does it do? Being transformed by the sweet taste of the non-corporeal, indivisible, and eternal blissful nature, it engages those karmic aggregates that are unfit for it, in the form of mutual interpenetration, and binds them. And they, by the impure cognition of the soul, also engage the soul, which has become transformed into karmic nature, in the form of being enveloped, and thus the soul too is bound. Therefore, even the non-corporeal soul has the possibility of bondage in the empirical point of view. Thus it is said, "Bondage is certainly of the nature of the characteristics, and its knowledge is the absence of liberation of the soul."

Page #332:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

328
The description of the nine substances and the path to liberation, like the sweet taste of sugar, is opposite to the false view and the consequences of anger, hatred, etc.  The embodied being, along with its karma-bandha, gives space to the karmic particles in its own region, which are fit for karmic aggregation. This means that it binds them. In other words, this being, through its consequences of attachment, etc., which are contrary to its pure self-awareness, becomes involved in the aggregation of karmic particles that are fit for karmic aggregation, and thus becomes bound by them. Here, the idea is that the being is certainly non-embodied, but practically embodied. This is why karma-bandha is possible for the being. It is said:

> "There is a mutual relationship between the being and the particle with respect to karma-bandha, but they are different in terms of their characteristics. Therefore, the being is not non-embodied in isolation." || 134 ||

In this way, the fourth section is complete. Thus, the fifth section, which is an internal section, ends with four verses, mainly explaining merit and demerit, in the second great authority that explains the nine substances.

Now, the explanation of the substance of *āsrava* begins. This is the explanation of the nature of *puṇyāśrava*.

> "The one who has praiseworthy attachment, a consequence that is based on compassion, and whose mind is free from defilement, has the *āsrava* of merit." || 135 ||

> "Praiseworthy attachment, a consequence based on compassion, and a mind free from defilement - these three auspicious qualities are the cause of the *āsrava* of material merit, because they are only the cause, and the *āsrava* of mental merit arises after that *āsrava*. The auspicious karmic consequence that arises from this, through the door of yoga, is the *āsrava* of material merit for the particles that enter." || 135 ||

Explanation of the meaning: ( *yasy* ) The being who ( *praśastaḥ rāgaḥ* ) has praiseworthy attachment, ( *anukampāsaṃśritaḥ pariṇāmaḥ* ) a consequence based on compassion, ( *ca* ) and ( *citte kāluṣyaṃ na asti* ) whose mind is free from defilement, ( *jīvasya* ) that being ( *puṇyaṃ āsravati* ) has the *āsrava* of merit.

Commentary: This is a statement about the nature of *puṇyāśrava*. Praiseworthy attachment, a consequence based on compassion, and a mind free from defilement - these three auspicious qualities are the cause of the *āsrava* of material merit, because they are only the cause, and the *āsrava* of mental merit arises after that *āsrava*. The auspicious karmic consequence that arises from this, through the door of yoga, is the *āsrava* of material merit for the particles that enter.

Page #333:
---------------------------
The **five astikayas** are the cause only in the form of a **nimitta** (occasion), therefore **dravya punya asrava** is preceded by **bhaava punya asrava**, and those **shubha bhaava** (auspicious feelings) which are the occasion for them, are the **dravya punya asrava** which are the result of the **karma** of the **pudgalas** that enter through the **yoga dvaara** (door of yoga). || 135 ||

**Saṃ. Tā.** - Now, the **bhaava karma**, **dravya karma**, **nokarma**, **mati jñāna**, etc., **vibhaava guṇa**, **nara**, **naraka**, etc., **vibhaava paryāya** are all void, and from the pure **ātman** (soul) arises the **nirvikalpa samādhi** (meditation without thought) which is characterized by **abheda ratnatraya** (three jewels of non-duality) in the form of **śraddhā** (faith), **jñāna** (knowledge), and **anuṣṭhāna** (practice), and is filled like a full pot with the **samata rasa** (feeling of equality) and **paramānanda** (supreme bliss). From this **paramātman** (supreme soul) arises the **shubha** (auspicious) and **aśubha** (inauspicious) **āśrava** (influx). There are six **gāthā** (verses) on this topic. The first four **gāthā** deal with **puṇyāśrava** (influx of merit) and begin with the words "**rāgo jassa pasattho**" (whose passion is auspicious). The next two **gāthā** deal with **pāpāśrava** (influx of demerit) and begin with the words "**cariyā pamāda bahulā**" (whose conduct is full of negligence). Thus, this is a **samudāya pātanikā** (summary) of the **puṇya** and **pāpa āśrava** (influx of merit and demerit).

Now, the **niraśrava** (without influx) **śuddha ātman** (pure soul) is described as the opposite of the **shubha āśrava** (auspicious influx) - "**rāgo jassa pasattho**" (whose passion is auspicious) - the **rāga** (passion) which is **prashasta** (auspicious) and different from the **vītarāga paramātman dravya** (soul free from passion), is the **prashasta dharma anurāga** (attachment to auspicious qualities) which is filled with the **pañca parameṣṭhin** (five supreme beings). "**aṇukampā saṃsido ya parināmo**" (whose result is filled with compassion) - the **parināma** (result) which is **aṇukampā saṃśrita** (filled with compassion) is the **shubha parināma** (auspicious result) in the form of **mano vacana kāya vyāpāra** (actions of mind, speech, and body). "**citte niṭṭhi kaluso**" (there is no defilement in the mind) - there is no **kaluṣa** (defilement) in the **citta** (mind), there is no **kaluṣa parināma** (result of defilement) like **krodha** (anger) in the **manas** (mind). "**puṇṇam jīvasa āśavadi**" (whose life is filled with influx of merit) - the **jīva** (living being) who has these three **shubha parināma** (auspicious results) has **bhaava puṇya** (merit of feeling) which is the cause of **dravya puṇya āśrava** (influx of merit of substance). This is the meaning of the **sūtra** (aphorism). || 135 || Thus, the **shubha āśrava** (auspicious influx) is explained in the **sūtra gāthā** (verse of the aphorism).

**Pīṭhikā** - Further, this **ātman** (soul) is definitely the **paramātman** (supreme soul). It is void of **bhaava karma** (karma of feeling), **dravya karma** (karma of substance), **nokarma** (karma of non-action), **mati jñāna** (knowledge of the mind), etc., **vibhaava guṇa** (qualities of the object), **nara** (human), **naraka** (hell), etc., **vibhaava paryāya** (synonyms of the object). It is the **śuddha ātman** (pure soul) and is filled with the **nirvikalpa samādhi** (meditation without thought) which is characterized by the **abheda ratnatraya** (three jewels of non-duality) in the form of **śraddhā** (faith), **jñāna** (knowledge), and **anuṣṭhāna** (practice), and is filled like a full pot with the **samata rasa** (feeling of equality) and **paramānanda** (supreme bliss). From this **paramātman** (supreme soul) arises the **shubha** (auspicious) and **aśubha** (inauspicious) **āśrava** (influx). There are six **gāthā** (verses) on this topic. The first four **gāthā** deal with **puṇyāśrava** (influx of merit) and begin with the words "**rāgo jassa pasattho**" (whose passion is auspicious). The next two **gāthā** deal with **pāpāśrava** (influx of demerit) and begin with the words "**cariyā pamāda bahulā**" (whose conduct is full of negligence). Thus, this is a **samudāya pātanikā** (summary) of the **puṇya** and **pāpa āśrava** (influx of merit and demerit).

**Hindī Tā.** - **Uttānnikā** - Further, the **niraśrava** (without influx) **śuddha ātman** (pure soul) is described as the opposite of the **shubha āśrava** (auspicious influx).

**Any Sahit Sāmānya Arth** - (**jassa**) whose **jīva** (living being) has (**pasattho**) auspicious or good (**rāgo**) passion (**ya**) and (**aṇukampā saṃsido**) is filled with compassion (**parināmo**) feeling, and

(Chitte) In the citta (Kalussam) there is no kalusapan or impurity (Palthi) (Jivass) for that jiva (Punnam) punya karma (Asarvadi) comes.

**Special Meaning:**  
Vitaraga Paramatma dravya is distinct from the five Paramesthis like Arhant, Siddha, etc. There is complete guna-anuraga and that is the praiseworthy dharma-anuraga.  The activities of mind, speech, and body with compassion are the basis of anukampa.  The impurity of kshaya like krodha, etc. is called kalushta.  For the jiva whose bhavas have dharma-prema and daya, and who does not have the impurity of the intensity of kshaya, for that jiva, these auspicious results are the cause of the asrava of dravya punya karma, which is called bhava punya asrava.  Here, the nature of bhava punya asrava is explained in the sutra. || 135 ||

Thus, the gatha is complete, explaining the auspicious asrava.

**Teeka:** This is the explanation of the nature of Prashasth Raag.

Devotion towards Arhat, Siddha, and Sadhus, effort in the practice of Dharma, conduct, and character, and following the Gurus (like Aachaaryas, etc.) with devotion, is called 'Prashasth Raag' because its object is praiseworthy.

This (Prashasth Raag) is for the ignorant who are primarily devoted to devotion (from a gross perspective).  It may also be for the knowledgeable, when they have not attained stability in the higher realms (above guna sthana), to prevent the asthana raag or to alleviate the intense fever of raag. || 136 ||

##  Translation:

**331. Now, the nature of प्रशस्तराग is explained:**

Devotion to Arhats, Siddhas, and Sadhus; and the effort in Dharma, which is characterized by auspicious raag (शुभराग) and good conduct (चारित्र). This effort includes following the teachings (अणुगमण), adhering to the principles (अनुव्रजन), and living a virtuous life (अनुकूलवृत्ति). This is called प्रशस्तराग, as the Acharyas say, because it is the devotion to those who have destroyed the eight roots of karma (ज्ञानावरणादिमूलोत्तरप्रकृतयः) and their sub-categories, through the practice of Dharma-dhyana and Shukla-dhyana, which are free from the defilements of raag and other vices. They have become free from the eighteen defects (क्षुधाधष्टादशदोषरहिताः) and possess the infinite fourfold qualities (केवलज्ञानाद्यनंतचतुष्टयसहिताः). These are called Arhats.

Those who have destroyed the eight karmas (ज्ञानावरणाद्यष्टकर्माभावेन) and manifested the eight virtues (सम्यक्त्वाद्यष्टगुणलक्षणा), residing in the forefront of the world (लोकाग्रनिवासिनः), are distinct from the worldly Anjan-Siddhas and others, and are called Siddhas.

The unwavering conviction (निश्चय) in the true nature of the self (आत्मतत्व), which is characterized by pure knowledge (विशुद्धज्ञान) and right perception (दर्शन), the renunciation of desire for others' possessions (परद्रव्येच्छापरिहारेण), the practice of austerity (तपश्चरणं) by focusing on one's own self (आत्मद्रव्ये प्रतएनं), and the adherence to the principles (अनुष्ठानम) without relying on external support (स्वशत्त्यनवगृहनेना) - these constitute the five principles of conduct (निश्चयपंचाचारः). Similarly, the five principles of conduct based on the scriptures (आचारादिशास्त्रकचित्तक्रमेण), which are conducive to the practice of these principles (तत्साधकव्यवहारपंचाचारः), are also followed. Those who practice these principles themselves (स्वयमाचारंत्यन्यानाचारयंति) and guide others to do the same are called Acharyas.

Those who explain (कथयंति) and teach (उपादेयं) the nature of the soul (शुद्धजीवद्रव्यं), the essence of the soul (शुद्धजीवतत्त्वं), and the true nature of the soul (शुद्धजीवपदार्थं), based on the five categories of existence (पंचास्तिकाय), the six substances (षडद्रव्य), the seven principles (सप्ततत्त्व), and the four categories of objects (नपदार्थ), and who also explain (प्रतिपादयंति) and practice (भावयंति) the path to liberation (मोक्षमार्ग), which is characterized by the three jewels (भेदाभेदरत्नत्रयलक्षणं), are called Upadhyayas.

Those who practice the fourfold means of spiritual development (निश्चयचतुर्विधाराधनया) and strive to realize the true nature of the self (शुद्धात्मस्वरूपं साधयंति) are called Sadhakas.

Thus, the devotion (भक्तिः) to Arhats, Siddhas, and Sadhus, as well as to Acharyas, Upadhyayas, and Sadhus, both externally and internally, is called प्रशस्तराग.

An ignorant soul (अज्ञानी जीवो) develops this प्रशस्तराग due to the bondage (बंधेन) caused by the desire for worldly pleasures (भोगाकांक्षारूपनिदान). A wise soul (ज्ञानी पुनर्निर्विकल्पसमाध्यभावे), on the other hand, develops this प्रशस्तराग to destroy the inauspicious raag (अशुभराग) that arises from the attachment to objects (विषयकषायरूपाशुभरागविनाशार्थं). This is the essence of the meaning.

**136.**

**Hindi Translation:**

**उत्थानिका - आगे प्रशस्त राग का स्वरूप कहते हैं**

**Anvaya (Word Order) with General Meaning:**

(अरहंतसिद्धसाहुसु) In Arhats, Siddhas, and Sadhus, (भत्ती) devotion (य) and (थम्मम्मि) in the auspicious raag-based conduct (शुभ रागरूप चारित्रमें) (जा खलु चेट्ठा) the effort made with conviction (निश्चय करके उद्योग करना च) (गुरूणं पि अणुगमणं) following the teachings of the Gurus (गुरुओंके अनुकूल चलना) (पसस्थरागो त्ति) this is प्रशस्तराग (यह प्रशस्तराग है ऐसा) (वुच्चंति) the Acharyas say.

**Specific Meaning:**

The two wrong meditations (आर्तध्यान व रौद्रध्यान), which are opposed to the meditation of the faultless Supreme Soul (दोषरहित परमात्माके ध्यानके विरोधी), bind the eight roots of karma (ज्ञानावरणादि आठमूल) and their sub-categories (उनके भेदरूप उत्तर प्रकृतियोंका बन्ध होता है). These karmic formations (कर्मप्रकृतियोंको) are destroyed by the power of Dharma-dhyana and Shukla-dhyana (रागादि विकल्पोंसे रहित धर्मध्यान और शुक्लध्यानोंके बलसे नाश करके), which are free from the defilements of raag and other vices. Those who have become free from the eighteen defects (क्षुधा, तृषा आदि अठारह दोषोंसे रहित हो) and possess the infinite fourfold qualities (केवलज्ञानादि अनंत अतुष्टय के धारी हैं) are called Arhats (वे अर्हत कहे जाते हैं). Those who have destroyed the eight karmas (ज्ञानावरण आदि आठों कर्मोका नाश करके) and manifested the eight virtues (सम्यग्दर्शन आदि गुणोंको प्रगट करके), residing in the forefront of the world (लोकके अग्रभागमें निवास प्राप्त करलिया है), are distinct from the worldly Anjan-Siddhas and others (लौकिक अञ्जनसिद्ध आदिसे विलक्षण), and are called Siddhas (वे सिद्ध हैं). The unwavering conviction (निश्चय) in the true nature of the self (आत्मतत्व), which is characterized by pure knowledge (विशुद्ध ज्ञानद

## Description of the Path to Liberation through the Nine Substances

**Ruchi** is the certainty of right faith, **Samyakgyan** is the knowledge of that certainty, and **Samyakcharitra** is the unwavering experience of that certainty. **Tap** is the intense focus on one's own soul substance, renouncing the desire for external possessions, and **Voury** is the unhindered effort to achieve liberation. 

Those who practice these five types of **Nischya Achar** (certain conduct) and the five types of **Vyavahar Achar** (practical conduct) as described in the scriptures, both practicing them themselves and guiding others to do so, are **Acharyas**. 

Those who teach the **Ratnatraya** (three jewels) - the **Nischya Vyavahar** (certain practice) - as the path to liberation, and who themselves embody this path, are **Upadhyayas**. 

Those who practice the four types of **Nischya Aradhana** (certain worship) to purify their soul are **Sadhus**. 

Those who possess the qualities described above, and who are worthy of being called **Acharyas**, **Upadhyayas**, and **Sadhus**, are **Jineendras**. 

**Prashasta Rag** (noble attachment) is the devotion to these individuals, both externally and internally. 

Ignorant beings experience this noble attachment due to the **Nidana** (cause) of desire for worldly pleasures, while enlightened beings experience it to eliminate **Kashaya** (passions) and **Ashubha Rag** (unwholesome attachment) without attaining **Nirvikalpa Samadhi** (state of complete absorption). 

## 136

This is a description of **Anukampa** (compassion).

## 137

**Tisi** (thirsty), **Bubhukhid** (hungry), or **Dukhita** (suffering) - whoever sees a **Dukhita** (suffering) being with a **Dukhita Mano** (suffering mind) and feels compassion for them, that is **Anukampa**.

## 137

**Tṛṣita** (thirsty), **Bubhukṣita** (hungry), or **Duḥkhita** (suffering) - whoever sees a **Duḥkhita** (suffering) being with a **Duḥkhita Manaḥ** (suffering mind) and feels compassion for them, that is **Anukampa**.

## 137

Seeing someone suffering, the ignorant person feels compassion out of a desire to help them, while the enlightened person feels sorrow for the suffering of all beings trapped in the ocean of birth and death.

## Anvayaartha (Meaning of the Sentence):

**Tṛṣita** (thirsty), **Bubhukṣita** (hungry), or **Duḥkhita** (suffering) - whoever sees a **Duḥkhita** (suffering) being with a **Duḥkhita Manaḥ** (suffering mind) and feels compassion for them, that is **Anukampa**.

## Tika (Commentary):

This is a description of the nature of **Anukampa** (compassion).

Page #337:
---------------------------
The compassion of an ignorant person is when, seeing a creature suffering from thirst, hunger, or other pain, he is filled with anxiety due to compassion and desires to help. The compassion of a wise person, however, is a slight sorrow in the mind when observing the world immersed in the ocean of birth, while dwelling in the lower realms (i.e., when he himself is in the lower stages of spiritual development). 

This is the nature of compassion. When someone sees a creature suffering from thirst, hunger, or pain, and feels sorrow in his heart, and accepts that creature with compassion, that is compassion. 

For example, an ignorant being, seeing someone suffering from intense thirst, hunger, or severe illness, becomes anxious, thinking, "How can I help this person?" and feels compassion. A wise person, however, not being attached to his own feelings, does not become agitated by suffering, but instead helps as much as possible, and feels a special sense of compassion and detachment when seeing someone suffering. This is the meaning of the sutra.

Page #338:
---------------------------
The description of the path to liberation through the nine substances is purity. This purity arises in the knower of truth when the passions are completely destroyed. Sometimes, even the knower experiences this purity in the intermediate realms, due to the use of the passions, which are not completely abandoned, following their arising. ||138||

Commentary: This is a statement about the nature of the defilement of the mind. Defilement is the agitation of the mind caused by the intense arising of anger, pride, deceit, and greed. Purity is the calmness of the mind caused by the mild arising of these same passions. This purity arises in the ignorant when the passions are completely destroyed. Sometimes, even the knower experiences this purity in the intermediate realms, due to the use of the passions, which are not completely abandoned, following their arising. ||138||

Page #339:
---------------------------
The attainment of a pure soul, free from the five astikayas and ego, is opposed to pride. The attainment of a soul free from the world is opposed to illusion. The agitation that prevents the satisfaction arising from the contemplation of the pure soul is called agitation. The agitated state of mind that is opposed to the experience of the pure soul, free from agitation, is called mental agitation. The agitation in the mind caused by the intensity of these passions, such as anger, is called defilement. The state of mind that is opposed to this defilement is called purity or auspicious attachment, which is in the form of mild passions. This very state is the cause of the inflow of karmic actions. This state arises even in an ignorant person with a false view, when the mild rise of infinite attachment occurs. And this auspicious state arises in a knowledgeable person when he does not experience the benefit of his own experience without any defilement, and the knowledgeable person, in order to avoid wrong meditation, adopts this state of mind, which is in the form of happiness, as compassion, forgiveness, etc. || 138 ||

Thus, the causes of the inflow of auspicious karmic actions have been explained in four verses.

This is the description of the nature of the inflow of inauspicious karmic actions. The conduct full of carelessness, the defilement, the fickleness in the objects, the causing of sorrow to others, and the slander of others, all these cause the inflow of inauspicious karmic actions. || 139 ||

The conduct full of carelessness, the defilement, the fickleness in the objects, the causing of sorrow to others, and the slander of others, all these cause the inflow of inauspicious karmic actions. || 139 ||

The culmination of conduct full of carelessness, the culmination of defilement, the culmination of fickleness in the objects, the culmination of causing sorrow to others, and the culmination of slander of others, these five inauspicious states are the mere causes of the inflow of material inauspicious karmic actions, because they are the cause of the inflow of material inauspicious karmic actions. Therefore, the inflow of mental inauspicious karmic actions precedes the inflow of material inauspicious karmic actions. And those [inauspicious states] which are their cause, the inauspicious karmic results of the pudgalas that enter through yoga, are the inflow of material inauspicious karmic actions. || 139 ||

Meaning of the text: (Conduct full of carelessness) very careless conduct, (defilement) defilement, (fickleness in the objects) fickleness towards objects, (causing sorrow to others and slander of others) causing sorrow to others and speaking ill of others, that (causes the inflow of inauspicious karmic actions) causes the inflow of inauspicious karmic actions.

Commentary: This is the statement of the nature of the inflow of inauspicious karmic actions.

The culmination of conduct full of carelessness, the culmination of fickleness in the objects, the culmination of causing sorrow to others (the culmination of causing suffering to others), and the culmination of slander of others - these five inauspicious states are the mere causes of the inflow of material inauspicious karmic actions, therefore, the inflow of mental inauspicious karmic actions precedes the inflow of material inauspicious karmic actions.

And those [inauspicious states] which are their cause, the inauspicious karmic results of the pudgalas that enter through yoga, are the inflow of material inauspicious karmic actions. || 139 ||

## Translation:

**Verse 9211**

This verse describes the path to liberation through the nine substances. It explains the nature of the five types of *papasrava* (karmic influx).

**Commentary:**

* **Pramada-bahula charya:** A course of action characterized by excessive carelessness, hindering the attainment of the state of pure consciousness.
* **Kalushya-parinati:** A state of defilement, the opposite of the state of pure consciousness.
* **Vishaya-lolita-parinati:** A state of excessive attachment to sensory objects, hindering the experience of inner peace.
* **Para-paritapa-parinati:** A state of causing suffering to others, contrary to the experience of pure compassion.
* **Para-apavada-parinati:** A state of criticizing others, the opposite of self-awareness.

These five states are called *bhaava-papasrava* (karmic influx arising from mental states) because they are the cause of *dravya-papasrava* (karmic influx affecting the physical body). *Dravya-papasrava* is the result of actions performed through the mind, speech, and body, motivated by these five states.

**Verse 140**

This verse further elaborates on the nature of *papasrava*.

**Commentary:**

* **Sanjnaa:** The three types of *leshya* (subtle karmic tendencies) - *tiivra* (intense), *indriya-vashada* (controlled by the senses), and *attaroudra* (cruel).
* **Gyaana:** Knowledge that is misused, leading to *moha* (delusion).
* **Moha:** Delusion, which is the root cause of *papasrava*.

The verse also mentions the three types of *leshya* - *krishna* (black), *neela* (blue), and *kapota* (grey) - which are associated with the three *kashya* (passions) - *raaga* (attachment), *dvesha* (aversion), and *moha* (delusion). These *leshya* are the result of the *yoga* (actions) motivated by the three *kashya*.

Page #341:
---------------------------
The five types of *āsrava* are:

1. **Ārtta** (distress): This arises from the desire for the cessation of pain, the desire for the attainment of pleasure, and the desire for the means to achieve these ends.
2. **Roudra** (cruelty): This arises from the *kaṣāya* (passions) of anger, hatred, and greed, and manifests as violence, lying, stealing, and the enjoyment of sensual pleasures.
3. **Duṣṭa-jñāna** (misguided knowledge): This is knowledge that is used for evil purposes, even though it may be derived from good sources.
4. **Moha** (delusion): This arises from the obscuration of the true nature of reality by the *kaṣāya* and manifests as ignorance, confusion, and attachment to the world.

These four types of *āsrava* are the causes of *dravya-pāpa-āsrava* (the *āsrava* that leads to the accumulation of karmic matter).

Page #342:
---------------------------
The question arises as to why the explanation of the path to liberation through the nine substances is being given. The Acharya explains this by saying that just as water enters through a doorway, so too does the influx of karmic matter (āsrava) of both merit and demerit through the doorway of emotions (bhāva). Here, the entry is the main point, but in the case of merit and demerit, the main point is their staying on after entry in the form of the states of existence (sthiti), experience (anubhāga), and bondage (bandha). Thus, in the second major section dealing with the nine substances, the explanation of the influx of merit and demerit is mainly concluded in the sixth chapter of the sixth section.

The Hindi translation says: "Further, the explanation of the influx of demerit is given in detail."

The general meaning with the grammatical structure is: [Saṇṇāo] four designations, [Ya] and [Tilesa] three blemishes (Indriyavasada) being under the control of the senses (Ya) and (Attaruhaṇi) agitated, fierce meditation, [Duppouttam ṇāṇam] knowledge applied to wrong actions (Cha) and (Moho) delusion, all these (Pāvaṇyadā) are givers of demerit (Hoti) are.

The specific meaning is: These four designations, namely food, fear, sexual intercourse, and possessions, are different from the pure consciousness that is devoid of designations like food, etc. The three inauspicious blemishes, namely black, blue, and dove-colored, are those that retain the characteristics of the tendency of the yogas, which are colored by the arising of the passions, and are distinct from the pure consciousness that is free from both passions and yogas. The dependence on the objects of the five senses is the covering of the culmination of the taste of the independent, transcendental pleasure. The four types of agitated meditation are those that are filled with the desire for the four causes, namely, favorable conjunction, unfavorable separation, destruction of disease, and enjoyment, which obstruct the feeling of pure consciousness that is devoid of all desires. The four types of fierce meditation are those that arise from a wicked mind that is distant from the feeling of pure consciousness that is devoid of the force of anger, and are involved in the protection of violence, lying, stealing, and possessions. The knowledge that is applied to any other evil state, abandoning both good use and pure use, and being under the control of false views and passions, is called misused knowledge. The delusion that destroys the self-realization that is devoid of the network of alternatives like egotism, etc., which arises from the arising of delusion, is called the delusion of perception and the delusion of conduct. This is the elaborate explanation of the various states and emotions. All these emotions are the cause of the influx of karmic matter of demerit. Thus, one should understand the expansion of the influx of demerit, which is caused by the influx of karmic matter of demerit, as mentioned in the previous sutra. This is the meaning.

Here, someone might ask, "Why is the explanation of the influx of merit and demerit being given when both merit and demerit had already been discussed earlier?" The Acharya answers this by saying that just as water enters through a doorway, so too does the influx of karmic matter (āsrava) of both merit and demerit through the doorway of emotions (bhāva). Here, the entry is the main point, but in the case of merit and demerit, the main point is their staying on after entry in the form of the states of existence (sthiti), experience (anubhāga), and bondage (bandha).

Page #343:
---------------------------
The **Panchaastikaya** primarily discusses the **punya** (merit) and **papa** (demerit) and their **sthiti** (state) and **anubhag** (experience) as **bandha** (bondage). This is its special characteristic. In this way, the sixth **antaradhikār** (sub-chapter) of the second **mahaadhikār** (major chapter) dealing with the **navapadaartha** (nine substances) is completed with the explanation of **āsrava** (influx) of **punya** and **papa** through six **gāthās** (verses).

Now, the explanation of **sanvara** (restriction) is given.

**Anvayārtha** (meaning): Those who remain on the **samyag** (right) path [**sanvaramārga** (path of restriction)], by restraining the **indriya** (senses), **kaṣāya** (passions), and **saṁjñā** (perceptions) to the extent they do, to that extent the **pāpāsrava** (influx of demerit) is blocked for them.

**Tīkā** (commentary): This explanation of **sanvara** is given because **papa** is **ananta** (infinite).

The **mārga** (path) is actually **sanvara** (restriction), and by its means (cause), the **indriya**, **kaṣāya**, and **saṁjñā** are restrained to the extent or for the time they are restrained, to that extent or for that time the **pāpāsrava** (influx of demerit) is blocked. The **indriya**, **kaṣāya**, and **saṁjñā** are the cause [**nimitta**] of **bhāvapāpāsrava** (influx of demerit in the form of emotions), which is the cause of **dravyapapāsrava** (influx of demerit in the form of matter) as explained earlier (in the 140th verse). Here, their restraint is the cause of **bhāvapāpasamvara** (restriction of demerit in the form of emotions) and **dravyapapāsrava** (restriction of demerit in the form of matter), which should be understood. ||141||

**Saṁ. Tā.** (Summary): This verse, beginning with "**Indriyakaṣāya**", is a **samudāyapātanikā** (verse that destroys a group of things) in the explanation of **sanghara** (restriction) which is achieved by **paramopekshā** (supreme indifference) **saṁyama** (self-control) that is free from all **śubhāśubha** (auspicious and inauspicious) **saṁkalpa** (thoughts) and **vikalpa** (doubts) and is characterized by **śuddhātmasamvitti** (pure self-awareness) which is the result of **nidānabandha** (bondage due to causes) such as **kāṁkṣā** (desire) for **bhoga** (enjoyment) and **dṛṣṭaśruta** (seen and heard) **pujālābha** (honor and gain).

Page #344:
---------------------------
The text describes the path to liberation (moksha) through the cessation of karmic influx (papasrava). It states that the senses, passions (kṣayās), and the four types of food (āhāras) are restrained and prohibited by those who are the doers (kartṛbhūta) and who are particularly well-established (sudu-suṣṭhu) on the path. How are they restrained? As long as they remain in a particular state of being (guṇasthāna) for a certain period of time, the karmic influx is stopped. This is explained in the following verse:

"Sixteen, twenty-five, nine, ten, six, thirty-two, four, sixteen, and one" (sōlasa paṇavīs ṇabhaṁ dasa cara chakkēkk bandhavōchhiṇā | dugatīs caḍurapuñce paṇa sōlasa jōgiṇō ēkkō').

English translation preserving Jain terms:

This is an explanation of the general nature of Punya (merit) and Papa (demerit) Samvara (restraint).

Whose (Yasya) - the one who (na vidyate) does not have (rago) attachment, (doso) aversion, (moho va) or delusion (sarva-dravyesu) towards all substances.

For that Bhikshu (ascetic) who has equanimity towards pleasure and pain, (na astravaati) the (shubham) auspicious and (ashubham) inauspicious karmas do not flow in (samasu-kha-duhkhasya) as he is equipoised in happiness and sorrow.

This is the description of the general nature of Samvara. The cessation of the transformations of delusion, attachment and aversion is Bhava-samvara (intrinsic restraint). And the cessation of the transformations of auspicious and inauspicious karmas entering the soul, which occurs through Yoga (spiritual effort), is Dravya-samvara (practical restraint).

## Tayartha - Description of the Path to Liberation
**344**

Thus, in the second great authority, which speaks of new substances, three stanzas are completed with the explanation of the substance of *samvara*. The seventh inner authority is finished.

**Now, the explanation of the substance of *nirjara***

This is the explanation of the nature of *nirjara*.

**[144]**
*He who is united with *samvara* and *yoga*, by means of various austerities, constantly destroys many karmas.*

**Explanation:**

*Samvara* is the cessation of the results of good and bad karma, and *yoga* is pure utilization. He who is united with these two ( *samvara* and *yoga* ), by means of external austerities such as fasting, non-attachment, counting of breaths, renunciation of taste, solitary bed and seat, and bodily austerities, and by means of internal austerities such as atonement, humility, conduct, self-study, renunciation, and meditation - thus, he who engages in various austerities, truly destroys many karmas. Therefore, here [in this stanza, it is said that] pure utilization, which is strengthened by external and internal austerities, is capable of destroying the power of karma, and by its influence, the destruction of a part of the accumulated karmic matter, which has become tasteless, is the destruction of the substance of karma. 

**[144]**

Now, there is the explanation of the substance of *nirjara*.

**Meaning:**

[He who is united with *samvara* and *yoga*] He who is united with *samvara* and *yoga* (pure utilization), [by means of various austerities] engages in various austerities, [he] constantly destroys many karmas.

**Commentary:**

This is the statement of the nature of *nirjara*.

*Samvara* means the cessation of the results of good and bad karma, and *yoga* means pure utilization. He who is united with these two (*samvara* and *yoga*), by means of external austerities such as fasting, non-attachment, counting of breaths, renunciation of taste, solitary bed and seat, and bodily austerities, and by means of internal austerities such as atonement, humility, conduct, self-study, renunciation, and meditation - thus, he who engages in various austerities, truly destroys many karmas. Therefore, here [in this stanza, it is said that] pure utilization, which is strengthened by external and internal austerities, is capable of destroying the power of karma, and by its influence, the destruction of a part of the accumulated karmic matter, which has become tasteless, is the destruction of the substance of karma.

**Pancastikaya Prabhrut**

345. The text now describes the nature of Nirjara. It says, "Sanvara Jogehin Judo" - one who is united with Sanvara Yoga, through the power of pure self-realization, is Sanvara, which is the cessation of the results of good and bad karma. The Yoga, which is described by the word "Nirvikalpa Lakshana Dhyana", is pure use. One who is united with these two, and who strives through various forms of tapas, is the one who destroys many karmas.

**Anvaya Sahait Samaanyarth** - (The one) who is virtuous (Sanvara Jogehin Judo) is united with Sanvara and Yoga, or pure use, and (Bahuvehihin Tavehi) through various forms of tapas (Chitthade) strives for the highest good (So) he (Bahugaan Kamman) destroys many karmas (Nijjaran) (Niyadam Kunadi) for sure.

**Vishesharth** - The cessation of good and bad karmas through the power of pure self-realization is Sanvara. The pure use, which is described by the word "Nirvikalpa Lakshana Dhyana", is Yoga. The external six types of tapas that are conducive to pure self-realization are: Anashana (fasting), Adamoudarya (control of the senses), Vrittiparisankhyan (counting of thoughts), Rasaparitayaga (renunciation of taste), Vivikta Shayyanasana (sitting and lying in solitude), and Kayaklesha (physical austerities). The internal six types of tapas are: Prayaschitta (atonement), Vinaya (humility), Vaiyaavrittya (study of scriptures), Swaadhyaaya (self-study), Vyutsarga (renunciation), and Dhyana (meditation). These six tapas are the natural purification of one's own self. The virtuous one who is united with Sanvara and Yoga, and who practices these twelve types of tapas, surely destroys many karmas. The meaning here is that the pure use, which is the state of being free from attachment and filled with supreme bliss, is achieved through the practice of these twelve types of tapas. This pure use is capable of eradicating the root of karmas. The destruction of the karmic particles, which were previously bound, through the power of this pure use, is called Dravya Nirjara. 144.

Translation preserving Jain terms:

The main exposition of the cause of nirjara (shedding of karmas) is presented here.

He who is endowed with samvara (stoppage of influx of new karmas), who is the true accomplisher of his own spiritual good, having known the self, meditates steadfastly on the knowledge, he shakes off the dust of karmas. (145)

Commentary: The one who is endowed with samvara, i.e., the one who is equipped with the complete cessation of auspicious and inauspicious dispositions, who has thoroughly understood the true nature of the object (the distinction between what is to be avoided and what is to be accepted), whose intellect is turned away from others' interests, and whose mind is solely engaged in accomplishing his own purpose - such a being, having directly experienced the self, contemplates that very knowledge steadfastly. He, indeed, is completely devoid of attachment, purified of the stickiness of attachment, like a pure crystal pillar, shakes off the dust of previously accumulated karmas.

This shows that meditation is the principal cause of nirjara (shedding of karmas).

Page #351:
---------------------------
The soul, through the knowledge of the distinct unity of the qualities and the qualified, which is the result of the knowledge of the distinct unity, becomes the meditator. The meditator is the one who has the characteristics mentioned earlier and meditates on the Supreme Soul. What does he do? He destroys the karma - he destroys the karma dust. Here, the meaning of the sutra is that meditation is the cause of the destruction of karma. ||145||

The Hindi translation states that meditation is the main cause of the destruction of karma.

The general meaning with the word order: (He) (who is united with restraint) united with restraint (who is the seeker of the nature of the soul) the seeker of the nature of the soul (by) by certainty (himself) the soul (knowing) knowing (steady) steady [knowledge] the knowledge of the soul [is] is the meditator (he) he [karma] the dust of karma [destroys] destroys.

The specific meaning: Whoever is united with the restraint of good and bad passions, etc., and who, understanding the essence of what is to be abandoned and what is to be accepted, removes himself from other purposes and becomes the seeker of the pure soul experience, and who, knowing the soul as the eternal, blissful, one form, free from passions, etc., through the knowledge of self-awareness, becomes steady in the soul, and who meditates on the soul with the unwavering meditation of the attainment of the steady soul, which is the result of the knowledge of the distinct unity of the qualities and the qualified, becomes the meditator of the Supreme Soul. He destroys the karma dust. In fact, meditation is the cause of the destruction of karma. This is the meaning of this sutra. ||145||

This is the explanation of the nature of meditation. For one who does not have passion, hatred, delusion, or the karma of the path, the fire of meditation, which burns good and bad karma, arises. ||146||

For one who does not have passion, hatred, delusion, or the karma of the path, the fire of meditation, which burns good and bad karma, arises. ||146||

The pure, unwavering consciousness is meditation. Now, the method of attaining the soul is explained. When the yogi, due to the karma of the path, has collected the karma of seeing, conduct, and delusion, and then, turning away from the continuation of that karma, he places himself in the pure soul, free from attachment, aversion, and hatred, with unwavering steadiness, then, because his consciousness, which is the form of inaction, is at rest, his speech, mind, and body, engaged in their own work, are capable of burning all good and bad karma as fuel, and meditation, which is like fire, arises, which is the cause of the attainment of the highest goal. Thus it is said:

.. Description of the nine substances and the path to liberation "Even now, by purifying the three jewels, one attains Indrahood. From there, by becoming a human, one attains liberation." "The scriptures are endless, time is short, and we are dull-witted. Therefore, only that which destroys old age and death is worth learning." ||146||
Thus ends the explanation of the Nirjara substance. 
Anvaya-artha (Yasy) For whom (Moha; Raga: Dvesha) delusion, attachment, and aversion (Na vidyate) do not exist (Va) and (Yoga-parikarma) the practice of yogas is not there (i.e., indifference in mind, speech, and body), (Tasy) for him (Ramake) (Shubhashubha-dahanah) the fire that burns the auspicious and inauspicious (Dhyanamaya: Agni) the fire of meditation (Jayate) manifests.
Commentary—This is a statement about the nature of meditation.
Pure, unwavering, and unchanging consciousness is true meditation. The method of its manifestation is now being described—When a yogi truly experiences the ripening of the karmas that cause delusion in perception and conduct, and he contracts that ripening into karmas (which are inanimate and different from himself), then, according to that ripening, he turns away from the use (i.e., he stops the flow of karmas according to that ripening), and he makes that use, which is not deluded, attached, or averse, completely pure and merges it into the soul. Then, for that yogi, who is resting in his inactive, conscious nature, speech, mind, and body are not pleasing (he does not experience them) and he does not engage in his own actions. Because he is capable of burning all auspicious and inauspicious karmas, which are like fuel, meditation, which is like fire, manifests, and it is the means to achieve the ultimate goal.
Then it is said, "Even now, by purifying the three jewels, one attains Indrahood. From there, by becoming a human, one attains liberation." "The scriptures are endless, time is short, and we are dull-witted. Therefore, only that which destroys old age and death is worth learning."
In these two quoted verses, the first verse is from the Mokshapraabhrut, written by Shrimad Bhagavat Kundakundaacharya Dev.
Meaning—Even now, by meditating on the soul through the three jewels, one attains Indrahood and the state of a Lokantik Dev, and from there, by becoming a human (i.e., by taking birth as a human), one attains liberation.
The scriptures are endless, time is short, and we are dull-witted. Therefore, only that which destroys old age and death is worth learning. ||146||
—Thus ends the explanation of the Nirjara substance.  Santao.—Now, previously, the cause of Nirjara was described as meditation. Here, the materials and characteristics of its origin are explained. Jass Na Vijjadi—For whom it does not exist. Who is that? Rago Dosho Moho Va—Attachment, aversion, and delusion, or the body born from the arising of delusion in perception and conduct.

## Translation:

**Pancastikaya Prabhruta**
349

The consequence of raga (attachment) and dvesha (aversion) is moha (delusion), which is distinct from the supreme self, characterized by the absence of the network of vikalpa (false perceptions) and the presence of qualities like pure self-awareness. Or, it is the consequence of moha (delusion). Again, what is not present in the yogi? The consequence of yoga is the activity of mind, speech, and body, which is the opposite of the nature of the supreme self, characterized by the absence of the karma-kanda (actions) of auspicious and inauspicious karma, and the presence of the jnana-kanda (knowledge) in the form of pure, inactive, and conscious evolution. This is the material for meditation. Now, the definition of meditation is stated. 

**Tassuhasuhadhano jhanamo jaayade agani** - For him, the fire of meditation arises, characterized by the power to burn the fuel of auspicious and inauspicious karma, which is the result of the wonder of inactive and pure consciousness. Thus, just as even a small fire burns a large pile of grass and wood in a short time, so too, the fire of meditation, ignited by the great wind of the abandonment of the false views and kshaya (passions), and nourished by the ghee of extraordinary joy and happiness, burns the pile of karma-fuel, which is different from the root and other natures, in a moment.

Here, the disciple says: "Meditation does not exist in this age. Why? Because of the absence of the fourteen purva (previous scriptures) and the absence of the first samhana (assembly)."

The objection is countered: "There is no white meditation in this age. Thus, it is said in the Moksha Prabhruta by Sri Kundakunda Acharya:

"**Bharhe dussamakale dhammajhanam havei naniss. Tam appasahavavide na hu mannai so du annani**" "**Ajjavi tiyarana - Suddha appa jhaavi lahai indattan. Loyantiya devattan tasy chuda nivvudin janti.**"

Here, the reasoning is given: "If, in this age, there is no certain conduct as described in the scriptures, then let the ascetics practice the conduct of raga (attachment), which is devoid of restraint. Thus, it is said in the Tattvanusasana Dhyana Grantha:

"**Charitaro na santi adya yathakyatasya samprati. Tatkimanye yatha shakti macarantu tapodhanaha**"

What is said about the meditation of those who hold all the scriptures is a general statement. In the explanation of exceptions, however, only the knowledge of the scriptures that expound the five samiti (assemblies) and three gupti (secrets) leads to omniscience. If this is not the case, then how can the statement "**Tusasamsam dhoto tribhudi kevali jado**" and so on be true? Thus, it is said in the Charitrasara and other scriptures during the explanation of the five nirgratha (liberated) states, starting with the pulaka (hair-raising) state: "Those who attain omniscience after a moment are called nirgratha. Those who are in the state of kshaya (passions) are called nirgratha. Their knowledge of the fourteen purva is excellent, and their knowledge of the five samiti and three gupti, which are eight in number, is inferior.

What is said about the meditation that arises from the first samhana, which is called Vajravrishabhanaracha, is also a general statement. The explanation of exceptions is that for those who are in the state of the highest qualities, the white meditation is a rule, but it is not a prohibition for those who are in the lower states of qualities. It is not a prohibition for those who are in the lower states of qualities. Thus, it is said in the Tattvanusasana:

"**Anto natthi sudinam kalo thoo vayam cha dummeha. Tapanavari sikkhiyam jam jaramarana khayam kunai.**"

"**Yatpunarvajrakaayasya dhyanamityagame vacaha. Shrenyor dhyanam pratitiyoctum tannaathastannisedhakam.**"

Thus, knowing that meditation can be attained even with a small amount of scripture, one should accept the essence of the teachings, which is the purification of the self, the destruction of the samvara (restraint), the removal of the nirjara (decay), and the destruction of old age and death, and practice meditation. It is said:

Page #354:
---------------------------
The chapter on Nirjara, the main topic of the second major chapter on the path to liberation and the nine substances, is concluded in the eighth chapter of the Yoga section.  

**General Meaning with Anvaya:** 
"The one who does not have (vijjati) attachment (rago), aversion (doso), delusion (moho), and the actions of mind, speech, and body (jonaparikammo) within them (tassa), that one (jassa) has (jayae) the fire of meditation (jhanamo) that burns (suhasuhadhano) both good and bad emotions (agani) within them."

**Specific Meaning:** 
The result of attachment, aversion, and delusion is distinct from the pure soul, which is free from the entanglement of attachment (mamata) in the form of choices arising from the emergence of karma, and is free from delusion, and is filled with qualities like experience.  The result of actions of mind, speech, and body is called the result of yoga, which is opposite to the supreme soul, which is free from the actions of good and bad karma, and is filled with the knowledge that is the culmination of pure consciousness.  The one who has neither attachment, aversion, delusion, nor the actions of yoga is the meditator.  This is said to be the main material for meditation.  Now, the characteristics of meditation are described.  The fire of meditation is that which is strong enough to burn the fuel of good and bad karma.  The yogi who has this fire of meditation within them will be fulfilled by the wonder of pure consciousness, free from defilement and action.  Just as a small fire can burn a large pile of grass and wood in a short time, so too, the fire of meditation, which is the experience of the unshakeable soul, fueled by the great power of renunciation of false views, passions, and other obstacles, and nourished by the nectar of supreme bliss, which is unprecedented and wonderful, burns the pile of karma, which is of many forms due to the differences in the root and the subsequent nature, in an instant.

**Student's Objection and Acharya's Response:** 
Here, the student says, "Meditation cannot happen in this fifth time period, because there are neither the Shruta-knowing men who have the ten previous and fourteen previous vows, nor the first unification."  The Acharya resolves this doubt by saying, "There is no white meditation in this fifth time period, as Shri Kundakunda Acharya himself has said in the Mokshapahuḍ.  In this fifth time period of suffering in the Bharat Kshetra, the right faith meditation can happen for the right faith knowing one, and it happens for the one who knows the nature of the soul.  The one who does not believe this is ignorant.  Even now, one can attain the state of Indra and the state of worldly gods by meditating on the soul, keeping the mind, speech, and body pure.  From there, one can go to liberation."

Page #355:

Pancastikaya Prabhrut
351 This is also called a reasoning. If in this time, there cannot be a Yathakyata Charitra, then let the Tapasvijan who have lost their Samyama, follow the Saraga Charitra. As it is said in Tattvanusasan,
If in this time, there are no holders of Yathakyata Charitra, then should other Tapasvi not follow Charitra as much as they can?
This which is said that the holders of Sarva Shrutajan have Dhyana, is Utsarga, that is, an excellent statement. In the exception form or in the medium explanation, it is said that the knowledge of only Shruta, which tells about the five Samiti and three Guptika, leads to Kevalgyan. If this does not happen, then how can this be proven, as it is said, "Tus Masam Ghosanto Sivabhuudo Kevali Jado", that is, just like Tus (husk) and Mas (black gram) or Dal (pulse) are different, similarly, Atma is different from Anatma, thus proclaiming, Shivabhudi Muni became Kevalgyani.
Similarly, in Charitrasaradi Granthas, it is said in the explanation of Palak etc. five Nirmath Munis. Those who can generate Kevalgyan in a Muhurta (moment) are called Nirmath. They are the ones who are in the twelfth Gunasthan, called Kshina Kshaya. They have the knowledge of the excellent Shruta, fourteen Purva, and the knowledge of the lowest five Samiti and three Guptika, that is, the knowledge of eight Pravachan Matrika.
And this which is said that Dhyana happens from the first Sanhanan, called Vajravrishabhanaracha, is also Utsarga Vachan. The exception explanation is that in the Upshama and Kshapaka category, which are in the Aaprava etc. Gunasthan, there is Shukla Dhyana, and compared to that, the rule of the superior Sanhanan is there. There is no prohibition of Dharma Dhyana for those who have other Sanhanan below the Aaprava Gunasthan. Similarly, it is said in Tattvanusasan,
What is said here in the Agam about the Dhyana of Vanakaya, is said taking into account the Shukla Dhyana compared to the category, there is no prohibition of Dhyana below the category. In this way, knowing that Dhyana happens even from a little knowledge of Shruta, it is appropriate to do Dhyana by accepting the essence of the teachings, which are the cause of Sanvar and Nirjara, which tell about the pure Atma, and which remove Jara and Maran. This is the feeling. It is also said,
There is no end to the Shastras, the time of life is short, our intellect is small, therefore, we should learn only that which destroys Jara and Maran. 146.

## The Explanation of the Bond (Bandha)

This is the explanation of the nature of the bond (bandha). 

**Verse 147:**

If the soul (atma) is attached (rakta) to a manifested (udirna) state of either auspicious (shubha) or inauspicious (ashubha) feeling, then it becomes bound (baddha) by that feeling through various types of karmic matter (pudgala karma).

**Commentary:**

This is a statement about the nature of the bond. 

In reality, this soul, being attached (rakta) from the beginning of time due to its dependence on external objects, creates auspicious or inauspicious feelings that manifest due to the influence of karmic fruition (karma-udaya). Thus, the soul becomes bound by those feelings, which are the causes, through various types of karmic matter. 

Therefore, it is said here that the attachment (snigdha) of the soul to auspicious or inauspicious states due to delusion (moha), attachment (raga), and aversion (dvesha) is called "feeling-bond" (bhaav-bandha). 

And the mutual immersion (urchhana) of the karmic matter (pudgala) that has transformed into auspicious or inauspicious karma, along with the soul, is called "substance-bond" (dravya-bandha).

**Summary:**

This section explains the concept of "bond" (bandha) in Jainism, which refers to the attachment of the soul to the material world through karmic matter. The bond is created by the soul's attachment to feelings, which are influenced by karmic fruition. This attachment leads to the soul's entanglement with the material world, hindering its liberation (moksha).

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

Panchastikaya Prabhrita
353. Being devoid of any external conditioning, the pure soul, endowed with the qualities of untainted knowledge and bliss, undergoes a transformation and assumes a favorable or unfavorable state, departing from its own self-awareness. This is how the bondage occurs - the soul, through its state of attachment, becomes the agent of bondage. What is the instrumental cause? It is the manifold karmic matter - the various karmic aggregates in the form of material particles.

Here, the transformation into favorable or unfavorable states, contrary to the pure nature of the soul, is the bondage of state (bhava-bandha). Due to this, there is an association of karmic matter with the impure, attached soul, just as the impurity binds to those anointed with oil, and this is the bondage of substance (dravya-bandha). This is the purport of the sutra.

148. This explains the external and internal causes of bondage. The instrumental cause of yoga (activity) is yoga arising from mind, speech, and body. The causal factor of bondage is the state (bhava) endowed with attachment, aversion, and delusion.

**Description of the Nine Substances and the Path to Liberation**

_The **grahana** (acceptance) of karma-pudgalas is their entry into the karma-skandha that is associated with the jiva's region. This is caused by **yoga**. Yoga is the activity of the self-region, which is based on the categories of speech, mind, body, and karma. **Bandha** (bondage) is the state of karma-pudgalas with a specific type of power. This is caused by **jiva-bhava**. Jiva-bhava is the state of being characterized by attachment, aversion, and delusion, which is a modification produced by the ripening of the delusion-inducing karma._

_Here, yoga is the external cause of grahana because it is the cause of the acceptance of karma-pudgalas. Jiva-bhava is the internal cause because it is the cause of the specific power and state of karma-pudgalas._

**Commentary:**

This is a statement about the external and internal causes of bondage.

**Grahana** means the entry of karma-pudgalas into the karma-skandha that is associated with the jiva's region. This is caused by **yoga**. **Yoga** is the activity of the self-region, which is based on the categories of speech, mind, body, and karma.

**Bandha** means the state of karma-pudgalas with a specific type of power. This is caused by **jiva-bhava**. **Jiva-bhava** is the state of being characterized by attachment, aversion, and delusion, which is a modification produced by the ripening of the delusion-inducing karma.

Therefore, here (in bondage), **yoga** is the external cause because it is the cause of the acceptance of karma-pudgalas, and **jiva-bhava** is the internal cause because it is the cause of the specific power and state of karma-pudgalas.

**Translation of the Sanskrit Commentary:**

This section explains the external and internal causes of bondage. The acceptance of karma-pudgalas is caused by yoga. Yoga is the activity of the self-region, which is based on the categories of speech, mind, body, and karma. It is the cause of the acceptance of karma.

Bondage is caused by jiva-bhava. It is the state of being characterized by attachment, aversion, and delusion. This is a modification produced by the ripening of the delusion-inducing karma.

Here, the external cause of bondage is yoga, which is the cause of the acceptance of karma-pudgalas. The internal cause of bondage is the karmas, which are the cause of the specific power and state of karma-pudgalas.

## Pancastikaya Prabhruta 355

**Hindi 010 - Utghaanika - Further explains the external and internal causes of bondage.**

**General Meaning with Anvaya:** (Joganimittan) Due to the cause of yoga, karma pudgalas are taken (Jogo) Yoga (Manavayanakayasambhudo) happens through the actions of mind, speech, and body. (Bandho) Their bondage (Bhavanimitto) happens due to the cause of emotions. (Bhavo) That emotion (Radiraagadosamohjudo) is tainted with attachment, passion, aversion, and delusion.

**Specific Meaning:** Yoga is the movement of the soul, characterized by the action of mind, speech, and body, which is different from the pure, unchanging, luminous consciousness. It is the cause of taking karma, which is destroyed by the destruction and pacification of the karma of the past. The emotion that arises from the delusion of perception and the delusion of conduct, which is different from the light of pure consciousness, is the emotion that is tainted with attachment, passion, aversion, and delusion. Here, the word "rati" should be taken as the desire for pleasure, which is inseparable from humor, and the desire for women, men, and eunuchs, and the desire for the knowledge of the Vedas. The word "rag" should be taken as the desire for illusion and greed. The word "dvesha" should be taken as the six types of aversion, which are anger, pride, aversion, sorrow, fear, and disgust. The word "moha" should be taken as the delusion of perception or false perception. These emotions cause the bondage of the state and the bondage of the parts. Here, the external cause of bondage is yoga, because it is the cause of the taking of karma, which leads to the bondage of nature and the bondage of the parts. The internal cause is the emotion of kshaya, because it is the cause of the state and the parts of karma, which causes the karma pudgalas to remain with the soul for a long time. || 148 ||

This also indicates the external cause of the bondage of the substances like false perception, etc.

**Heeduchatu-viyappo Atthaviy-ppass karanam bhanidam.
Tesim pi ya raagadi tesi-mahave na bajjhati. || 149 ||**

**Hetuscha turvikalpo'shtavikalpasya karanam bhanitam.
Tesham api cha raagaadayasteshamahave na badhyante. || 149 ||**

In other texts, the four-fold cause of karma, which is the cause of bondage, is said to be the substance cause, which is the four-fold cause of false perception, non-restraint, kshaya, and yoga. Even these, the emotions of the soul, like passion, etc., are the causes of bondage, because even if the emotions of passion, etc., are not present, the soul is not bound even if the substances of false perception, non-restraint, kshaya, and yoga are present. Therefore, it is certain that passion, etc., are the causes of bondage because they are the waves. || 149 ||

Thus ends the explanation of the meaning of bondage.

356
Description of the Nine Substances and the Path to Liberation, with Anvaya (Fourfold Cause: Cause) (False Belief, etc.) Four types of causes (Cause of the Eightfold Karma) have been described as the cause of eight types of karma. [Even these] also (Passion, etc.) (In the Jiva) have passion, etc., as their cause. (Absence of these) In the absence of passion, etc., (They are not bound) the Jiva is not bound.
Commentary: This is a clarification of the fact that false belief, etc., (False belief, etc., are the categories of substance) are also (In binding) external causes.
In other scriptures (In other scriptures), false belief, non-restraint, passions, and yoga have been described as the four types of substance-causes (Substance-conditions) that are the cause of the eight types of karma and are the cause of binding. Even these have passion, etc., as the cause of their being the cause of binding, because in the absence of passion, etc., the Jiva is not bound even in the presence of false belief, non-restraint, passions, and yoga in the substance. Therefore, it is certain that passion, etc., are the internal cause of binding, and thus they are the cause of binding. ||149||
Thus ends the explanation of the substance of binding. Sa. Ta. - Now, it is not only yoga that is the external cause of binding, but also false belief, etc., and the categories of substance, etc., are also external causes in relation to the cause of passion, etc.

---------------------------
The eight types of karma (causes of bondage) are mentioned in the Pancastikaya Prabhrit 357 (Atthaviyappassa). These eight types of karma are the causes of bondage (bandhake karanam). They are also the causes of the karmic substances (dravya karma) like mithyatva (falsehood), etc. (tesipi ya). These karmic substances are caused by passions like raga (attachment), etc. (tesim). When these passions are absent (abhave), the soul (jiva) does not get bound (na vajanati).

**Special Meaning:**

The four types of karmic substances that arise from mithyatva (falsehood), aviriti (non-restraint), kshaya (passions), and yoga (attachment) are mentioned as the causes of bondage for the eight new types of karmic substances. These karmic substances are those that cover the true nature of the soul (parmatma) which is free from passions and possesses the eight qualities like samyaktva (right faith), etc. The cause of these karmic substances is the passions like raga (attachment), etc., which are different from the pure soul (atma dravya) that is free from passions. This is because even if the passions related to the soul are absent, the soul does not get bound if the four karmic substances or causes are present. This is because the soul that is free from attachment to desirable and undesirable objects does not get bound. If the soul gets bound simply by the arising of these karmic substances, even without the passions, then the soul would always be bound because the karmic substances are always arising in worldly souls. Therefore, it is known that the new karmic substances are the causes of the arising of the karmic substances. The cause of these karmic substances is the passions of the soul. Therefore, it is proven that not only yoga (attachment) is the external cause of bondage, but the karmic substances are also the external causes of bondage.

Thus, the ninth chapter of the second Mahaadhikaran (great chapter) which deals with the nine substances, is completed with the explanation of bondage in three verses.

**Now, the explanation of the substance of liberation:**

This is the explanation of the nature of liberation, which is the liberation from the karmic substances, the cause of liberation, and the ultimate restraint.

**Verse 150:**

> **Hetvabhave niyamajjayate jnaninah asravanirodhah. Astravabhavena vina jayate karmanastu nirodhah.**

> **When the cause is absent, the restraint of the asravas (karmic currents) arises for the knower. Without the asravas, the restraint of karma arises.**

**Verse 151:**

> **Kammasabhavena ya savvahu savva-loga-darisi ya. Pavati indiya-rahidam avvabahm suh-mananta.**

> **When the karmic substances are absent, the soul sees all beings. It becomes free from the senses, free from bondage, and enjoys infinite bliss.**

This chapter explains that the absence of the karmic substances is the cause of liberation. The absence of the karmic substances leads to the restraint of the karmic currents, which in turn leads to the restraint of karma. When karma is restrained, the soul is liberated and enjoys infinite bliss.

##  Translation:

**358**

**Verse 151:**

By the absence of karma, the omniscient, the seer of all worlds, attains endless, unobstructed, and sensory-free bliss.

**Explanation:**

The cause of inflow (āsrava) is the feeling of attachment, aversion, and delusion in the soul. The wise one is devoid of this feeling. By the absence of this feeling, there is an absence of inflow. By the absence of inflow, there is an absence of karma. By the absence of karma, there is omniscience, the ability to see all worlds, unobstructed sensory activity, and infinite bliss. This is the state of liberation of the soul, known as jīvanmukti.

**How?**

The "feeling" referred to here is the activity of knowledge, which is the continuous functioning of the soul covered by karma. This feeling is impure for the worldly being due to the influence of the karmic force of delusion, which has been accumulating since beginningless time. However, this feeling is destroyed in the wise one by the cessation of attachment, aversion, and delusion. Therefore, the inflow is stopped. By the cessation of inflow, the karmic force of delusion is completely destroyed. The infinite, pure, and beginningless energy of the soul, which is free from all modifications, then manifests as the activity of knowledge. This activity transcends the limitations of time and space, and by the destruction of the veils of knowledge and vision, the wise one attains the state of perfect knowledge. Due to the absence of the continuous functioning of knowledge, the karmic force is destroyed. By the absence of karma, the wise one becomes omniscient, the seer of all worlds, free from sensory activity, unobstructed, and eternally blissful.

This is the type of liberation of the soul, which is the cause of the liberation of the substance, and the highest form of restraint.

**Verse 150-151:**

Now, the explanation of the concept of liberation.

**Meaning:**

By the absence of the cause (attachment, aversion, and delusion), the wise one naturally experiences the cessation of inflow. By the absence of inflow, there is the cessation of karma. By the absence of karma, the wise one becomes omniscient, the seer of all worlds, sensory-free, unobstructed, and attains infinite bliss.

**Commentary:**

This explains the nature of liberation of the soul, which is the highest form of restraint, the cause of the liberation of the substance.

The cause of inflow is indeed the feeling of attachment, aversion, and delusion in the soul. The wise one is devoid of this feeling. By the absence of this feeling, there is an absence of inflow. By the absence of inflow, there is an absence of karma. By the absence of karma, there is omniscience, the ability to see all worlds, unobstructed sensory activity, and infinite bliss. This is the state of liberation of the soul, known as jīvanmukti.

"How?" If this question is asked, the explanation is as follows:

The "feeling" referred to here is the activity of knowledge, which is the continuous functioning of the soul covered by karma. This feeling is impure for the worldly being due to the influence of the karmic force of delusion, which has been accumulating since beginningless time. However, this feeling is destroyed in the wise one by the cessation of attachment, aversion, and delusion. Therefore, the inflow is stopped. By the cessation of inflow, the karmic force of delusion is completely destroyed. The infinite, pure, and beginningless energy of the soul, which is free from all modifications, then manifests as the activity of knowledge. This activity transcends the limitations of time and space, and by the destruction of the veils of knowledge and vision, the wise one attains the state of perfect knowledge. Due to the absence of the continuous functioning of knowledge, the karmic force is destroyed. By the absence of karma, the wise one becomes omniscient, the seer of all worlds, free from sensory activity, unobstructed, and eternally blissful.

Page #363:
---------------------------
The 351 **Jivas** who have attained **Asrava** cessation are said to have attained **Nirvikarata** (freedom from modifications) due to the destruction of **Moha** (delusion). Then, the **Jivan** who has attained infinite **Chaitanya** (consciousness) and **Veerya** (power) from the beginningless time, attains **Kutastha Jnana** (absolute knowledge) by the destruction of **Jnana Avarana** (knowledge veil), **Darsana Avarana** (perception veil) and **Antaray** (obstacles) simultaneously, through the **Shuddha Jnapti Kriya** (pure perception action) in the **Ksheena Moha Gunasthan** (stage of subtle delusion). This happens because the **Jivan** transcends the **Karma** (action) due to the absence of **Kramapravritti** (sequential activity) in the form of **Jnapti Kriya**. Therefore, due to the absence of **Karma**, the **Jivan** becomes truly **Sarvajña** (omniscient), **Sarvadarshi** (all-seeing) and **Indriya Vyapara Ateeta** (transcending sensory activities), **Avyabhadha** (unobstructed) and **Ananta Sukhavala** (possessing infinite bliss) forever.

This is the nature of **Bhavakarma Moksha** (liberation from the karmic effects of emotions) and the cause of **Dravyakarma Moksha** (liberation from the karmic effects of matter) - **Param Sanvara** (ultimate restraint).

Page #364:
---------------------------
The text describes the path to liberation (moksha) through the Jain perspective. It explains that after experiencing the first white meditation (Shukla Dhyana) which illuminates the path of liberation, the individual overcomes the defilements of attachment (raga) and aversion (dvesha) through the practice of right conduct (charitra). This leads to the destruction of the veil of ignorance (moha) and the attainment of a state of pure, unblemished self-awareness (nirvikar shuddhatma anubhuti). This state, characterized by the absence of attachment (vitaraag charitra), marks the end of ignorance (moha kshapan). 

After the destruction of ignorance, the individual remains in the state of diminished karmic tendencies (kshinakshaya guna sthana) for a brief period. Then, through the second white meditation (dvitiya shukla dhyana), the three karmas that obstruct knowledge and vision (jnana darshan avarana antaray karma) are eradicated simultaneously. This leads to the attainment of liberation (bhavamokhsa), characterized by the infinite fourfold nature of perfect knowledge (kevaljnana) and other qualities.

The text further explains that the attainment of liberation (bhavamokhsa) is synonymous with the attainment of perfect knowledge (kevaljnana), the state of being liberated while still alive (jivanmukta), and the state of an Arhat (a fully liberated being).

Page #365:
---------------------------
The soul, which is of the nature of knowledge, etc., and is the essence of the five astikayas, attains the state of Dharma-dhyana, which is the essence of the soul. In the Agamas, it is said that the soul, by taking the path of the four Gunasthanas, starting from the state of Asanyata Samyagdristi, etc., destroys the Darshan-moha in any of the Gunasthanas and becomes Kshayika Samyagdristi. Then, in the Muni state, the soul ascends to the Gunasthanas of A-purvakarana, etc., and experiences the first Shukla-dhyana, which is the pure, luminous, and discerning knowledge that the soul is distinct from all karmas, their natures, etc. Then, due to the absence of the arising of raga, dvesha, charitra, and moha, the soul attains the state of Dhi-traga-charitra, which is the experience of the pure, unchanging soul and is capable of destroying charitra-moha. Through this Vitraga-charitra, the soul destroys moha-karma. After the destruction of moha, the soul dwells in the twelfth Gunasthan, called Kshina-kashaya, for a moment and contemplates the second Shukla-dhyana. Through this dhyana, the soul destroys the three karmas of Jnana-avaran, Darshan-avaran, and Antaraya at the end of this Gunasthan, completely and permanently, and attains liberation, which is the state of infinite knowledge, etc., the essence of the four infinite qualities. This is the essence. || 150 - 151 ||

Thus, two verses have been spoken about the nature of liberation. This is the explanation of the dhyana, which is the cause of the destruction of the karmas and the liberation of the soul. 

Darshan-nana-samaggam jhanam no anna-davy-sanjuttam.
Jayadi nijjar-hedu sabhav-sahidasa sadhussa. || 152 ||

Darshan-jnana-samagram dhyanam no anya-dravya-sanjuktam.
Jayate nirjara-hetuh svabhava-sahitasya sadhoh. || 152 ||

Thus, for the liberated Bhagavan Kevali, who is satisfied with his own nature, whose actions are exhausted due to the destruction of the karmas, whose coverings are destroyed, whose knowledge and vision are infinite, whose consciousness is pure, who is beyond the senses, who is free from association with other substances, whose nature is unchanging and luminous, and whose essence is not worthy of being called dhyana, how can his essence be described as the cause of destruction, seeing the fall of his accumulated karmas, their power, and their destruction? || 152 ||

Anvaya-artha: (Svabhava-sahitasya sadhoh) The liberated Bhagavan Kevali, who is endowed with his own nature, (darshan-jnana-samagram) whose knowledge and vision are complete, and (no anya-dravya-sanjuktam) who is not associated with any other substance, (dhyanam) his dhyana (nirjara-hetuh jayate) is the cause of destruction.

Tika: This is the explanation of the dhyana, which is the cause of the ultimate destruction of the karmas and the liberation of the soul. Thus, in reality, this liberated Bhagavan Kevali, who has attained liberation, whose actions are exhausted due to the destruction of the karmas, whose coverings are destroyed, whose knowledge and vision are infinite, whose consciousness is pure, who is beyond the senses, who is free from association with other substances, whose nature is unchanging and luminous, and whose essence is not worthy of being called dhyana, how can his essence be described as the cause of destruction, seeing the fall of his accumulated karmas, their power, and their destruction? || 152 ||

Page #366:
---------------------------
## 362

The nature of the soul (the soul's own state), which is worthy of being called 'Dhyana' (meditation) because it is devoid of association with other substances due to the shedding of the covering of the nine substances and the path to liberation, due to the infinite knowledge and perception, due to the complete pure knowledge consciousness, and due to the transcendental nature, is described as the cause of the exhaustion (diminution) of the power of the karmas accumulated in the past or their fall (destruction), as the cause of exhaustion. ||152||

**Commentary:**

Here, the text explains the nature of Dhyana (meditation) as the cause of the exhaustion of all substances, which is the destruction of the four types of karmas that are the cause of the remaining sensations, etc.

The explanation is given in the form of refutation of the words "Dansa" etc. By "Dansa" and "Nana" (knowledge) and "Darsana" (perception), what is meant is complete (perfect) Dhyana (meditation). Again, what is the specific nature of this Dhyana? It is not associated with any other substance. Such Dhyana is the cause of exhaustion. Of whom? Of the soul, which is associated with its own pure nature.

Indeed, the liberated Kevali (omniscient being), having attained the state described earlier, is free from all modifications and is characterized by supreme bliss, and is satisfied with the happiness arising from his own nature. Due to the destruction of the covering of knowledge and perception, he has inherent pure knowledge and perception, and due to the transformation of his consciousness into pure consciousness, he is free from the activities of the senses and the dependence on external substances. Therefore, his nature is devoid of association with other substances, and is characterized by unwavering consciousness. Seeing the destruction of the state and the melting away of the karmas accumulated in the past, which are the cause of Dhyana, this nature of the soul is called Dhyana, in a metaphorical sense.

**Objection:**

The disciple asks, "This Dhyana, which is devoid of dependence on other substances, may be for the Kevalis (omniscient beings). Why? Because it is said that Dhyana is metaphorical for the Kevalis. In the texts like "Charitra Sara", it is said that "those who are in the state of hypocrisy, meditate on the substance atom or the state atom, and produce Kevala Jnana (omniscient knowledge)". How can this be devoid of dependence on other substances?"

**Resolution:**

The text says that the word "substance atom" refers to the subtle nature of the substance, and the word "state atom" refers to the subtle nature of the state. It is not the pudgala atom. This explanation is given in the "Sarvartha Siddhi" commentary.

The explanation of this dialogue is as follows: The word "substance" refers to the soul substance. Its atom is the state that is free from attachment and aversion. What is the meaning of "atom"? It is the subtle state. How is it subtle? It is subtle because it is beyond the reach of the state of samadhi without discrimination. This is the explanation of the word "substance atom".

The word "state" refers to the state of self-awareness and knowledge of the soul substance. Its atom is the state that is free from attachment, aversion, etc. What is the meaning of "atom"? It is the subtle state that is free from attachment, aversion, etc. How is it subtle? It is subtle because it is beyond the reach of the senses and the mind. This is the explanation of the word "state atom".

The meaning here is that for the initial stabilization of the mind, and for the purpose of deceiving the mind with the desire for objects, the liberated beings, the five supreme beings, etc., are to be meditated upon. When the mind becomes stable through intense meditation, then one should meditate on one's own pure soul nature.

Thus, it is said by Sri Pujyapada Swami in the explanation of "Nischya Dhyeya" (object of meditation): "The soul, being the doer, meditates on the soul, which is the object of action, with the soul as the instrument, and thus becomes omniscient."

The explanation of this is as follows: The soul, being the doer, meditates on the soul, which is the object of action, with the soul as the instrument, and thus becomes omniscient.

Therefore, knowing the relationship between the means and the end, and the relationship between the object of meditation and the meditator, there should be no dispute about the object of meditation. ||152||

Page #367:
---------------------------
The nature of the meditation that is the cause of the destruction of the remaining karmas, which are the cause of the exhaustion of all substances, is described as follows:

**General Meaning (with explanation):** The meditation that arises in the virtuous (sadhu) who possesses pure nature (shuddha svabhava) is the cause of exhaustion (nijjarhedu). This meditation (jhanam) is filled with (dasananaan samgam) perception and knowledge and is not (annadavvasanjuttam no) combined with other substances.

**Specific Meaning:** The Kevali Bhagwan, whose state of liberation through detachment (bhavamokharupa) was described in the previous verse, is free from the afflictions of worldly pleasure and pain (harsha vishadarupa sansarik sukha tatha duhkha ke vikaron se mukt hain). They are endowed with perfect knowledge (kevalgyan) and perfect perception (kevaldarshan) due to the destruction of the veils that obstruct them. They are free from the association of other substances (paradravy ke sangyog rahit hain) because they are merged in their innate pure consciousness (sahaj shuddha chaitanyabhav mein parinaman karne se) and because they are not dependent on external objects like the activities of the senses (indriyon ke vyapar adi bahari dravyon ke alamban ke nahin rahene se). They are stable and possess the nature of pure consciousness (sthira chaitanyasvabhav ke thari hain) because they are unwavering in their own nature (apne svabhav mein nischal hone se). This meditation is called the treatment (upchar) of the Kevali Bhagwan because it is the cause of the exhaustion (nirjara) of the karmas accumulated in the past, and the exhaustion is seen here.

Here, the disciple asks: Why is the meditation of the Kevali Bhagwan described as being free from the dependence on other substances? It is said that the meditation of the Kevali is called treatment, but in texts like Charitrasar, it is said that the non-omniscient ascetics (chhadmasth arthath asarvgy tapasvi) generate perfect knowledge by meditating on the substance atoms (dravya paramanu) or the state atoms (bhav paramanu). How can this meditation be free from the dependence on other substances?

The Acharya answers: The term "substance atom" should be understood as referring to the subtle nature of the substance, and the term "state atom" should be understood as referring to the subtle nature of the state. It should not be understood as referring to the pudgala atom. This explanation is given in the commentary on Sarvarthasiddhi. The same explanation is given here. Here, the term "substance" should be understood as referring to the self-substance (atma-dravya), and the term "atom" refers to the subtle state free from the attachments of attachment, aversion, etc. The subtle nature of the self-substance is called the "substance atom." This subtle state is taken here because it is the object of the state of complete absorption (nirvikalpa samadhi). This is the explanation of the term "substance atom." The term "state" should be understood as referring to the self-awareness (svasanvedan) knowledge-result of the same self-substance. The atom of this state, i.e., the subtle result free from the alternatives of attachment, etc., is the "state atom." This subtlety is taken here because it is the object of the state of complete absorption (nirvikalpa samadhi).

The description of the nine substances and the path to liberation is not the subject of the senses and mind. It is worthy to know the contemplation of the atom as a feeling.
Here, the feeling is that for the first stage disciples, in order to stabilize their mind and to avoid the attention of the form of desire for objects, the tradition is worthy of contemplating the five supreme beings, etc., but when the mind becomes stable through the practice of stronger contemplation, then one's pure self-nature is worthy of contemplation. Similarly, Sri Pujyapada Swami has explained the meaning of the object of contemplation: "Ātmānāmātma ātmānyevātmānāsau kṣaṇamupjanayan san svayambhūḥ pravṛttaḥ." The explanation of this sutra is: The soul that perceives its own soul in its own soul, by its own soul, even for a moment - that is, even for a single inner moment - becomes omniscient.
In this way, knowing the meaning of the object and the means, which are mutually dependent, and the practical and theoretical perspectives, it is not worthy to argue about the object. || 152 ||
This is the explanation of the nature of liberation of substance. The one who is endowed with restraint, who destroys all actions, who is free from the karmas of vedaniya and ayus, is liberated from existence by that, that is liberation. || 153 ||
Now, when the liberated one, the Kevalin, has attained liberation of feeling, the restraint of the supreme restraint, which is well-known, is established in the continuity of the subsequent karmas, and the contemplation of the supreme destruction, which is the cause of destruction, is well-known, then in the continuity of the previous karmas, sometimes by nature itself, sometimes by the method of destruction, the ayus karma becomes equal to the lifespan, and the ayus karma is destroyed according to its own nature, and at the time of giving up that existence, the complete separation of the karmas of vedaniya, ayus, name, and lineage from the soul; the liberation of substance of the karma particles. || 153 ||
Thus ends the explanation of the substance of liberation. || Thus ends the explanation of the nine substances, which are the subject of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, which are the components of the path to liberation. ||
Meaning of the verse: (The one who is endowed with restraint) The soul who is endowed with restraint (having attained perfect knowledge) (destroys all actions) destroys all karmas, (being free from the karmas of vedaniya and ayus) being free from the karmas of vedaniya and ayus, (is liberated from existence) is liberated from existence (by that) by that, (that is liberation) that is liberation.

This is a statement of the nature of dravya moksha.
In reality, when the Kevali Bhagwan attains bhava moksha, due to the attainment of param samvara siddhi, he obtains the destruction of the future karma-santati, and due to the attainment of dhyana siddhi, which is the cause of param nirjara, the previous karma-santati, whose state is perhaps naturally as much as that of ayu karma, and perhaps as much as that of ayu karma due to samudghata vidhan, is destroyed according to ayu karma, and the separation of the vedaniya-ayu-nama-gotra karma pudgals from the jiva at the time of leaving the bhava for apunarbhava (siddha-gati) is dravya moksha. ||153||
Thus, the explanation of moksha-padartha is complete, and the explanation of the nine padarthas, which are the subject matter of samyag darshan and samyag gyan, which are the components of moksha-marg, is also complete!
Santa - Now, dravya moksha, which is the name for all moksha, is being explained, which is - who is the doer, who is united with samvara - united with param samvara. What is he doing? He is destroying - he is destroying! What? All karmas - all karmas. Again, what is special about him? He is free from vedaniya-ayushya karma, which is known as vyapgatavedaniyaayushya karma. Such a person, what does he do? He abandons bhava - he abandons bhava, due to which he abandons the karma known as nama-gotra, which is the meaning of the word bhava. Due to that cause, he is known as moksha. Or, that person is moksha without any difference. That is the meaning. For example, when the Kevali attains bhava moksha, he performs sakala samvara, which is achieved by nirvikar samvitti, and experiences sakala nirjara of the long-accumulated karmas, which is achieved by the pure atma dhyana mentioned earlier, and when there is a remaining life of less than a muhurta, he performs kevali samudghata, which is the name for the complete destruction of the world, which is the destruction of the three karmas, vedaniya, nama, and gotra, which are more than the ayu, for the purpose of destroying the existence of the world, or for the purpose of destroying the existence of the world, or he does not perform it again when the ayu-sahakarma has the same duration of existence in the world. After that, he performs the third shukla dhyana, which is known as upvarana, which is the subtle action-perception, which is the form of his pure atma, which is steady in its nature. After that, he crosses the yogi-guna-sthana, and attains the fourth shukla dhyana, which is known as param yatha-khyata charitra, which is the attainment of the supreme samarasibhava, which is the characteristic of sukha-amrita-rasa-asvada-trpti, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana, which is the complete fulfillment of all shila-guna-nidhana,

The second major chapter, comprising fifty verses in ten sub-sections, concludes. It expounds on the nine substances, including the soul, which are the subject matter of perception and knowledge, the components of conduct and the path to liberation.

**Hindi Translation:**

The liberation of the substance is the same as complete liberation, as they say. 

**General Meaning with Anvaya:**

(The one) who is endowed with complete restraint (sanvarena jutto), (and) who is (adha) also (savvakammani) destroying all karmas (nijjaramano), (and) who is destroying vedaniya karma and ayu karma (vadagavedausso), (and) who abandons (muyadi) the world (bhavam) created by name and gotra karma, (tena) due to this (so) that very soul (mokkho) becomes liberation, or, according to the principle of non-difference, that very person is liberation.

**Specific Meaning:**

When the Kevali Bhagavan, residing in the thirteenth guna-sthana, attains liberation of the essence, he performs complete restraint, which is attainable through the experience of the pure self, free from modifications, and experiences the complete destruction of accumulated karmas, which is attainable through the pure self-meditation, as mentioned earlier. When only a few moments remain in his life, if the state of vedaniya, name, and gotra karmas is greater than the state of ayu karma, then, to destroy the greater state of these three karmas and to destroy the state of the world, he performs the Kevali-samudghata in four forms: danda, kapat, pratar, and lokapurna. Or, if the state of these three karmas is equal to the state of ayu karma, then he does not perform the Kevali-samudghata, but instead, he performs the third white meditation, called "sukshmakriya-pratipati," which is a subtle action in the form of steady conduct in his pure self. Then, he transcends the sa-yogi guna-sthana and enters the a-yogi guna-sthana. Here, he experiences the bliss of the pure self in all realms, transforming into a single form of bliss, and, being satisfied with the taste of the nectar of supreme harmony, he attains the fourth white meditation, called "samuchchhinna-kriya," which is the supreme character, a repository of all virtues and conduct. Then, in the last two moments of this guna-sthana, in the first moment, the seventy-two natures, including the body, and in the last moment, the thirteen natures of the four karmas: vedaniya, ayu, name, and gotra, are completely separated from the soul. This is called liberation of the substance. After being separated from all karmas, the liberated soul resides in the front part of the universe for a moment. After being liberated from the body, the movement of the liberated soul is like a potter's wheel that has been turned, due to its previous use.

## Pancastikaya Prabhrut
367

Like a gourd freed from its clinging vines, like a castor seed freed from its bondage, and like the flame of a fire ascending upwards by its own nature, they ascend upwards. They do not go to the Lokagra, the realm of the gods, because they lack the Dharmaastikaya, the cause of going. They remain in the Lokagra, enjoying the objects of the senses, the eternal, imperishable, supreme bliss, for an infinite time. || 153 ||

Thus, the nature of Dravya Moksha has been explained in two sutras. With the emphasis on Bhava Moksha and Dravya Moksha, the tenth Antar Adhikar has been completed in four gathas through two locations.

In this Tatparya Vritti, the first four gathas, starting with the gatha "Abhibandiun Siraasa," are primarily about the path of Vyavahar Moksha. Then, sixteen gathas explain the nature of the Jiva substance. Next, four gathas describe the Ajiva substance. Then, three gathas provide an introduction to the seven substances like punya, papa, etc. Following that, four gathas are dedicated to describing the two substances of punya and papa, and six gathas explain the nature of Shubha and Ashubha Asrava. After that, three sutras explain the nature of the Samvara substance, followed by three gathas explaining the Nirjara substance. Then, three sutras describe the Bandha substance, and finally, four sutras explain the Moksha substance. In this way, the ten Antar Adhikars, encompassing fifty gathas, describe the limbs of the path of Moksha, as well as the nine substances like Jiva, which are the subject matter of Darshan and Gyan. Thus, the second Maha Adhikar, which presents this explanation, is complete.

## Ath Mokshamarg Prapancha Suchika Chulika

This is the explanation of the nature of the path of Moksha.

Jiva - the sixth gana, unhindered vision, non-dual nature. Their conduct is established, their existence is blameless, it is said. || 154 ||

Jiva's nature is knowledge, unhindered vision, non-dual nature. Their conduct is established, their existence is blameless, it is said. || 154 ||

The path of Moksha is the conduct established by the nature of the Jiva. The nature of the Jiva is knowledge and vision, which are non-dual in nature, because they are the essence of the Jiva, which is characterized by special and general consciousness. Now, the existence of knowledge and vision, which are the essence of the Jiva, is not subject to change, decay, or destruction, and is free from the influence of attachment, aversion, etc. This is their conduct, and this is the path of Moksha. There are two types of conduct in the world: one's own conduct and the conduct of others. One's own conduct is at one's own time, and the conduct of others is at their time.

Page #372:

## 368
**Mokshamārga Prapancha Sūchika Chūlikā**

**Vityartha:** There, the existence-form that is situated in its own nature is the self-conduct, and the existence-form that is situated in another's nature is the other-conduct. That which is situated in its own nature, the existence-form, is completely unblameable due to its being different from the existence-form situated in another's nature. This is to be understood here as the direct path to liberation. || 154 ||

Now, this is the Chūlikā that indicates the expanse of the path to liberation.

**Anvayārthī:** (Jīvasvabhāva) The nature of the soul (apratihata jñānam) is unhindered knowledge and (darśanam) vision - (ananayamam) which is (jīvase) non-dual to the soul. (Tayoḥ) In those knowledge and vision (niyatam) there is a constant (astitvam) existence (aninditam) which is unblameable (cāritram ca bhaṇitam) which (Jinendra) has called conduct.

**Tīkā:** This is the statement of the nature of the path to liberation.

The conduct that is constantly present in the nature of the soul is the path to liberation. The nature of the soul is truly knowledge and vision because they are non-dual to the soul. The reason for knowledge and vision being non-dual to the soul is that the soul is born from the nature of consciousness in both its particular and general forms. Now, that which is constantly present in those knowledge and vision, which are the nature of the soul, and which is unblameable due to the absence of the existence that is the form of production and destruction, and the absence of the results of attachment, etc., is conduct. This is the path to liberation.

In worldly beings, conduct is truly of two types: (1) self-conduct and (2) other-conduct. (1) self-time and (2) other-time, this is the meaning. There, the existence-form situated in its own nature (cāritram) is self-conduct, and the existence-form situated in another's nature (cāritram) is other-conduct. Out of these (i.e., out of the two types of conduct), the conduct that is the existence-form situated in its own nature - which is completely unblameable due to being different from the existence-form situated in another's nature - is to be understood here as the direct path to liberation. || 154 ||

**Saṁ. Tā. TO:** From here onwards, in the third great chapter in the form of a Chūlikā, there are twenty gāthās, which are primarily about attaining liberation, and which explain in detail the conduct of certainty, the path to liberation. In those twenty gāthās, the first sūtra, "Jīvasahāo ṇāṇam," etc., is about the nature of the pure soul, which is knowledge and vision, and about the conduct that is constant in the nature of the soul being the path to liberation. Then, the second sūtra, "Jīvo sahāvaṇiyado," etc., is about the self-time, which is based on the pure soul, and the other-time, which is based on the results of false views, attachment, etc. Then, the two gāthās, "Jo paradavvam hi," etc., are primarily about the detailed explanation of the other-time, which is different from the self-time, which is based on faith in the pure soul, etc. Then, the two gāthās, "Jo savvasaṁga," etc., are primarily about the detailed explanation of the self-time, which is the nature of self-awareness without the modifications of attachment, etc. Then, the fifth sūtra, "Dhammādī saddhaṇaṁ," etc., is primarily about the explanation of the conduct of the path to liberation, which is the practice of the six substances, etc., as taught by the omniscient, free from attachment, and the five great vows, etc., based on correct faith and knowledge. Then, the three jewels of conduct are explained, and the nature of the three jewels of certainty, which are the means to achieve them, are explained.

Page #373:
---------------------------
The two gathas, starting with "Nichchayane", expound the path to liberation, beginning with the five astikayas. Following that, the sutra starting with "Jena Vijana" emphasizes that whoever experiences the supreme joy of pure soul-consciousness, beyond the senses, is the one who has transcended the illusion of existence. Then, the sutra starting with "Dasanana Charittani" in the eighth section, emphasizes that liberation and the bondage of karma are achieved through the three jewels of knowledge, conduct, and faith, respectively. 

Further, the five gathas starting with "Annanado Nani" explain that even though one is capable of attaining the state of perfect samadhi, characterized by the absence of duality, if one chooses to follow a path of attachment, then it is considered gross liberation. However, if one strives for that state but due to lack of resources, resorts to using good for bad purposes, then it is considered subtle liberation. 

Following that, the two sutras starting with "Sapadalda" emphasize that even though one may not attain liberation immediately due to the karmic consequences of their actions, the knowledge of the nine substances, including Tirthankaras and other liberated souls, along with devotion, will eventually lead to the accumulation of resources for pure and unblemished liberation in the future. 

The sutra starting with "Taha Nichudikamo" explains that the ultimate goal of this entire doctrine, starting with the five astikayas, is to achieve liberation, which is characterized by the absence of attachment. Finally, the gatha-sutra starting with "Maggappabhavanatu" concludes the doctrine, summarizing the essence of the teachings. 

Thus, the third Mahaadhikaran, with its twelve sections, provides a detailed explanation of liberation and the path to liberation. 

**Explanation:**

The text explains that the first part of the gathas describes the nature of the soul, while the second part describes the conduct that leads to liberation. Alternatively, it can be interpreted that knowledge, faith, and conduct are the nature of the soul. The text then elaborates on the characteristics of the soul, including its inherent purity, its ability to perceive both general and specific aspects of reality, and its freedom from the influence of the senses. 

The text further explains that the conduct that leads to liberation is characterized by the absence of attachment, aversion, and delusion. This conduct is described as being "unwavering" and "unblemished." The text emphasizes that this conduct is the only cause of liberation and that all other causes are ultimately illusory. 

The text concludes by urging the reader to constantly contemplate the nature of the soul and the conduct that leads to liberation. It warns that those who are attached to the illusory world will continue to suffer for an infinite amount of time.

**Mokshamārga Prapancha Sūchika Chūlikā Kimpi** ||154||  
Thus, by stating the nature of the soul, and by stating the nature of the soul's conduct, the path to liberation is explained. In the first instance, the verses are sung.

**Pīthikā** -  Further, the third great authority is on the special explanation of the main causes of liberation, namely, the certainty and practice of the path to liberation, in the form of a Chūlikā. It contains twenty verses beginning with "Jīvasahāo ṇāṇam".  Among these twenty verses, the nature of pure soul, the nature of pure knowledge, and the nature of pure vision are explained.  It is said that the nature of the soul is stable conduct, and that is the path to liberation.  Thus, in the first instance, the sūtra "Jīvasahāo ṇāṇam" etc. is stated.  Then, the sūtra "Jīvasahāo ṇiyado" etc. is stated, saying that the pure soul's own time is dependent on the pure soul, and the false time is dependent on the false nature and the results of passion, etc.  Then, there are two verses beginning with "Jo paradavvehi", etc., which mainly describe the special nature of the pure soul's own time, which is different from the false time, which is different from the pure soul's own time, which is in the form of support, etc.  Then, there are two verses beginning with "Jo savvasanga", etc., which mainly explain the special nature of the pure soul's own time, which is in the form of self-awareness, free from the alternatives of passion, etc.  Then, in the fifth instance, there is one sūtra beginning with "Dhammādī saddahaṇam", etc., which mainly describes the path to liberation, which is the practice of the six substances, etc., as described by the omniscient, free from passion, in the form of right faith, right knowledge, and the five great vows, etc.  Then, there are two verses beginning with "Ničchayaṇayeṇa", etc., which describe the path to liberation, which is the certainty of the three jewels of liberation, which are to be achieved by the three jewels of practice.  Then, the sūtra "Jeṇa vijāṇa", etc., is stated, which mainly explains that the feeling that only the transcendental joy arising from the contemplation of the pure soul is worth receiving is right vision.  Then, in the eighth instance, the sūtra "Dansaṇṇāṇacarittāṇi", etc., is stated, which mainly explains that liberation is achieved through the path of the three jewels of certainty, and the bondage of merit is achieved through the path of the three jewels of practice.  Then, there are five verses beginning with "Aṇṇāṇādō ṇāṇī", etc., which explain that one who, even though capable of staying in the restraint called Samāyika, which is the state of non-dualistic false absorption, abandons it and practices passionate conduct in solitude, considers it to be the cause of liberation, is called a gross false time.  And one who, desiring to stay in the restraint called Samāyika, which is the state of absorption, but not having the necessary materials, takes refuge in good use to avoid evil, is called a subtle false time.  Then, there is the main explanation that, although the knowledge of the Agamas, which describe the ancient ones like the Tirthankaras, and the nine substances like the soul, etc., and devotion to it, do not lead to liberation because of the result of merit-hearing in that time, yet liberation is achieved by obtaining the materials for the result of pure use, free from attachment, in due course, based on it.

Page #375:
---------------------------
There are two sutras, "Pancastikaya Prabhruta" and "Sampadatttham". The meaning of this Pancastikaya Prabhruta Shastra is that the cause of liberation is Vitaragta, which is the state of being free from attachments. This is stated in the sutra "Nistutikapa". Then, to complete the Shastra, there is a gatha sutra "Maggappabhavanatum". In this way, the third Mahaadhikari explains the path of liberation through twelve points.

The Hindi translation of the gatha is: "The first half of the gatha describes the nature of the soul, and the second half describes the nature of the soul, which is the path of liberation through the four virtues of character."

The general meaning of the gatha is: "The nature of the soul is pure knowledge and pure vision. These two are not different from the soul. The state of being steadfast in these two pure knowledge and vision is called Vitaragta, which is free from attachments and is called character. This character is the path of liberation."

The specific meaning of the gatha is: "Just as pure knowledge and pure vision are the nature of the soul, so too is the character of Vitaragta, which is the state of being steadfast in one's own nature. Pure knowledge is the ability to know all things in their infinite nature, and pure vision is the ability to perceive the general nature of all things. These two are the nature of the soul. Although these two knowledge and vision are different from the soul in terms of name, form, and purpose, they are not different from the soul in terms of substance, space, time, and state. Similarly, the character that is described above is not different from the nature of the soul. It is the state of being free from attachments, and it is the state of being steadfast in one's own nature. This character is of two types: one is called Paracharita, and the other is called Swacharita. Paracharita is the state of remembering the pleasant objects of enjoyment that one has experienced through others, and acting in a way that is contrary to one's own nature. Swacharita is the state of acting in accordance with one's own nature. This is the true character, and it is the cause of liberation. There is no other cause of liberation. We do not know this path of liberation, and therefore we are caught in the endless cycle of birth and death, which is caused by false vision and attachments."

Page #376:
---------------------------
The path to liberation, the index of the universe, the essence, has gone. Knowing this, now it is only appropriate to contemplate the nature of the being, the character that is steadfast and stable, which is the direct cause of liberation. As it is said,

"In the same way, those who are enamored with the worldly causes, their time has passed endlessly, because they have not known anything about the means of the causes of liberation." ||154||

Thus, by saying that the nature of the being is the path to liberation, the first stanza has been spoken.

"The being, by nature, is steadfast, but with fluctuating qualities, and is then the other time. If it does its own time, it will be freed from the bondage of karma." ||155||

The being of the world, because it is in the state of knowledge and perception, even though it is steadfast by nature, is still tainted by the pursuit of the arising of the primordial delusion, and because of the impure use, it is diverse in its nature, and its fluctuating qualities are the other time, the other character. And the same, by abandoning the pursuit of the arising of the primordial delusion, because of the pure use, it is unified in its nature, and its steadfast qualities are the own time, the own character. Now, if, in any way, the being, illuminated by the light of right knowledge, abandons the other time and takes up the own time, then it will surely be freed from the bondage of karma. For the character of the being, by nature, is the path to liberation. ||155||

Meaning of the verse: (The being) being, (steadfast by nature) (in terms of substance) even though it is steadfast by nature, (with fluctuating qualities, and then the other time) if it has fluctuating qualities, then it is the other time. (If) if it (does its own time) (by becoming transformed with steadfast qualities) does its own time, then (from the bondage of karma) it is freed from the bondage of karma.

Commentary: Here (in this stanza) the steadfast character in the nature of the being is shown to be the path to liberation by the destruction of karma through the acceptance of the own time and the abandonment of the other time. The worldly being, (in terms of substance) because it is in the state of knowledge and perception, even though it is steadfast by nature (-steadfastly situated), when it becomes transformed by following the arising of the primordial delusion, because of the impure use (-impure use), it takes on the diversity of its nature (-diversity of its nature), and its fluctuating qualities are the other time, the other character. There...

Page #377:
---------------------------
When the five-astīkāya (being) becomes extremely pure in its use, abandoning the consequences that follow the arising of the beginningless obscuring, then its fixed-quality-transformation, which is attained due to the oneness of the essence, is its own time, that is, its own conduct.

Now, if, in reality, the being, by manifesting the light of right knowledge, abandons its other time and embraces its own time, then it is certainly freed from the bondage of karma. Therefore, in reality, being fixed in the nature of the being, conduct, and the path of liberation is the way.

**Commentary:**

It is said that because the destruction of karma occurs by embracing one's own time, therefore, conduct that is fixed in the nature of the being is the path of liberation. The being is certainly fixed in its nature, but due to the influence of other factors, it becomes involved in other-time, which is the transformation of non-fixed qualities.

For example, the being, by its pure nature, is inherently pure in knowledge and perception. However, in practice, due to the arising of beginningless obscuring karma, which is opposed to the attainment of the pure self free from obscurations, it undergoes transformation into the categories of perception, knowledge, and other qualities, such as the categories of human, hell, etc., and becomes attached to other-time and other conduct.

But when, through the arising of the pure light of discrimination, it experiences the supreme self, which is the characteristic of supreme knowledge, and contemplates its own nature as pure and enlightened, then it becomes attached to its own time and its own conduct.

If it does its own time, then it is freed from the bondage of karma. Then, it is freed from the bondage, which is opposed to liberation, which is the manifestation of infinite qualities, such as perfect knowledge. Therefore, it is understood that conduct that is fixed in the nature of the being, which is characterized by one's own time, is the path of liberation.

This verse indicates the difference between one's own time and other-time.

The path to liberation is a subtle and intricate process, involving a shift from being engrossed in external objects (par-samaya) to recognizing the true nature of the self (sva-samaya). When one, through the pure light of discernment, experiences the self as the essence of the Supreme Being, they begin to live in accordance with the true nature of their own self. By understanding the nature of both the self and the external world, a being, free from attachment, merges into the pure self-awareness of their own true nature (sva-samaya). This liberation from bondage, which is the opposite of the manifestation of infinite qualities like perfect knowledge, is achieved. Thus, it is understood that the path to liberation lies in the unwavering conduct of the self, characterized by self-awareness, which is the true nature of the soul. ||155||

This verse concludes the explanation of the distinction between the self and the external world. This is a description of the nature of those who are engaged in external activities. A being who, driven by attachment, experiences pleasure or pain in external objects, is one who has abandoned their own true nature and is engaged in external activities. ||156||

Whoever, due to the influence of delusion and its consequences, engages in external objects, experiencing pleasure or pain, is considered to have abandoned their own true nature and is engaged in external activities. This is because the pure use of one's own nature is considered one's own conduct, while the use of external objects with attachment is considered external conduct. ||156||

Translation of the verse: (He) who (with attachment) in external objects (experiences) pleasure or pain (if he does), (that being) is one who has abandoned his own true nature and is engaged in external activities.

Commentary: This is a statement about the nature of those who engage in external activities.

A being who, due to the influence of delusion and its consequences, engages in external objects, experiencing pleasure or pain, is considered to have abandoned his own true nature and is engaged in external activities. This is because the pure use of one's own nature is considered one's own conduct, while the use of external objects with attachment is considered external conduct. ||156||

_Commentary: The text further clarifies the nature of those who are engrossed in external objects. A being who, driven by attachment, experiences pleasure or pain in external objects, is one who has abandoned their own true nature and is engaged in external activities. _

## Translation:

**Pancastikaya Prabhrut**

**Verse 156:**

Thus, whoever, having become corrupted from their own pure soul-substance, which is transformed into pure qualities, becomes transformed by the passion of attachment, which is contrary to the pure soul-principle, and performs actions that are characterized by indifference towards auspicious and inauspicious external substances, thereby becoming contrary to the pure utilization of external substances, and performs actions that are either auspicious or inauspicious in all external substances, that soul, being of the nature of knowledge and bliss, becomes corrupted from its own conduct, which is characterized by following the principles, and becomes a follower of the conduct of others, which is distinct from self-awareness and practice. This is the meaning of the sutra.

**Verse 157:**

The Jinas declare that whoever, by virtue of their own nature, has an influx of merit or demerit, becomes a follower of the conduct of others.

**Explanation:**

Here, the state of being imbued with auspiciousness is called the influx of merit, and the state of being imbued with inauspiciousness is called the influx of demerit. Thus, it is declared that whoever has an influx of merit or demerit, that is, whose soul is in that state, becomes a follower of the conduct of others. Therefore, the conduct of others is the path to bondage, not the path to liberation.

Two verses have been completed, describing the special nature of the other-worldly path, which is different from the 366 experiential forms and the definitive path to moksha.

The one who is free from all attachments, with a mind focused solely on the self, knows and perceives his own true nature with certainty. Such a jiva (living being) conducts himself in accordance with his own pure conduct. (158)

The one who is truly free from all attachments, with a mind focused solely on the self, knows and perceives his own true nature, which is of the nature of knowledge and perception, with certainty and stability. Such a jiva conducts himself in accordance with his own pure conduct, for residing in the form of pure vision and knowledge is indeed one's own true conduct.

**By what means?**  **Sixthly:** By the brilliance of the miraculous, unchanging consciousness. Therefore, the state of being steadfast in the nature of the soul, characterized by pure knowledge and perception, is the path to liberation. || 158 ||

**Hindi Ta:** - Uththānikā - Further, the nature of the person who initiates the practice of self-conduct is described in detail.

**General Meaning with Anvaya:** (He) who (savvasangamukko) is free from all attachments, (naanamaano) with a focused mind, (appaana) knows his own self (sahaveena) by nature (yida) steadfastly (jaanadi) knows (passadi) sees (so) he (jeevo) the soul (sagchariya) his own conduct (charadi) practices.

**Specific Meaning:** He who renounces all external and internal attachments of the three realms and three times through mind, speech, body, and action, causation, and approval, and is filled with the beautiful joy arising from the feeling of the Supreme Self, is like a pitcher filled with the nectar of supreme bliss, the taste of which is the ultimate happiness. He is free from the web of choices arising from all external influences due to the absence of desires for objects of enjoyment like the feather of a pigeon, etc., which he has seen, heard, and experienced. He is one-pointed in his mind and knows his own self as unchanging consciousness, shining with miraculous brilliance, as the knower of self and others. He sees, i.e., experiences, the same self without any choices. Such a soul experiences his own conduct, which is the experience of his pure self, and the language of the supreme path, the spiritual character called Vitraag Param Samayik. This proves that the steadfastness in the nature of the soul, characterized by pure knowledge and perception, is the path to liberation. || 158 ||

**This is the exposition of the path of pure self-conduct.**

**He practices his own conduct who is free from the nature of other substances, who practices the perception, knowledge, and choice of his own self without choice.** || 159 ||

**Charitam charati svakam sa yah paradravyaatmabhavarahitaatmaa. Darshanjnaanavikalpam avikalpam charatyatmanah.** || 159 ||

For he who is the king of yogis, being beyond all the illusions and webs of delusion, free from the nature of other substances, and constantly focusing on his own substance, practices the perception, knowledge, and choice of his own self without choice, he indeed practices his own conduct. For, relying on the certainty of the inseparable nature of the means and the end, which is based on pure substance,

## The Exposition of the Path to Liberation (Moksha)

**Verse 379**

The exposition of the path to liberation (Moksha) has been presented previously, relying on the concept of "self-other" (svaparapratyayaparyaya) and the distinction between means and ends (bhinnsadhyasadhanabhava), based on the principle of conventional reality (vyavaharanaya). This is not contradictory, as both the definitive (nishcaya) and conventional (vyavahara) realities have the relationship of means and ends, like gold and gold-stone. Therefore, the path to liberation (tirthapravartana) is governed by both principles.

**Commentary**

This verse describes the path of pure self-conduct (shuddh svaricharitra). The yogi, free from all delusions (mohavyaha), devoid of the sense of self in external objects (paradravya), and focused solely on the true self (svadravya), practices the distinction of perception and knowledge (darshanajnanavikalpa) as non-dual with the self (atman). This is true self-conduct.

Thus, the path to liberation has been presented based on the definitive reality (nishcayanya), relying on the non-dual nature of means and ends (abhinnsadhyasadhanabhava) of pure substance (shuddhdravya). The previous exposition (in verse 107) was based on the conventional reality (vyavaharanaya), relying on the concept of "self-other" (svaparapratyayaparyaya) and the distinction between means and ends (bhinnsadhyasadhanabhava). There is no contradiction here, as both the definitive and conventional realities have the relationship of means and ends, like gold and gold-stone. Therefore, the path to liberation (tirthapravartana) is governed by both principles.

**Explanation**

This verse further clarifies the concept of "self-time" (svayam) through a different approach. The phrase "charati - charati" (he walks - he walks) signifies the act of self-conduct. The question arises: what kind of conduct? The answer is "svakam charitam charati" (he walks his own conduct). This refers to the individual who, free from attachment (niruparaga), experiences constant bliss (sadananda), and lives a life of self-realization (nijatmanucharanarupa). This individual remains equanimous (samatabhavananukula) in the face of life and death, gain and loss, pleasure and pain, praise and blame.

Who is this individual? It is the yogi who is free from the sense of self in external objects (paradravya), devoid of all mental constructs (vikalpajala) like desire for sensory objects (panchendriyavishayabhilasha), egotism (mamatva), etc. This yogi does not identify with external objects (bahirangaparadravya) and does not consider them as part of the self (svabhava).

What does this yogi do? The verse states "darshanajnanavikalpam avikalpam charati atmanah" (he practices the distinction of perception and knowledge as non-dual with the self). This means that the dualistic perception of "I know" and "I see" (ahm jnata, ahm drashta), which arises in the state of duality (saviikalpa), becomes non-dual (nirvikalpa) in the state of samadhi. In this state, the yogi experiences the infinite knowledge and bliss (anantajnanananda) as non-dual with the self.

This verse, along with the previous one, further elaborates on the concept of "self-time" (svayam) and its non-dual nature (nirvikalpasvamsavedanasvarupa).

## The Path to Liberation: A Detailed Explanation

**Chapter 380**

The soul (Atma) acts in accordance with its own nature (Avyam), which is one and the same (Charadi). This is the same as acting in accordance with one's own character (Sag Charivam, Charadi).

**Explanation:**

A yogi who is free from the desires and attachments of the five senses, who is free from all the webs of delusion, and who has abandoned the sense of "mine" in all external objects, the sense of "I am the knower," "I am the seer," etc., and who experiences the infinite knowledge, infinite bliss, and other qualities and inherent nature of the soul by merging with it during the state of Nirvikalpa Samadhi, is a great soul. This great soul is impartial towards life and death, gain and loss, pleasure and pain, praise and blame, and is always joyful, nurturing the inner character of the soul through the experience of the soul itself.

Thus, two verses are completed, further explaining the special nature of the self-awareness in the state of Nirvikalpa.

**The path to liberation is the practice of the means to achieve liberation, as explained earlier.**

**Summary:**

Faith in Dharma, etc., is Right Faith (Samyaktvam), knowledge based on the Angas is Knowledge (Jnana), and effort in austerity is Conduct (Charya). This is the path to liberation.

**Explanation:**

The path to liberation is Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct. Faith in Dharma, etc., is based on the understanding of the true nature of the objects of the world. Right Faith is the state of being free from doubt about the true nature of things. Knowledge is the understanding of the true nature of things, based on the Angas. Conduct is the practice of austerity, as explained in the scriptures. This practice of austerity is based on the understanding of the self and the other, and is a means to achieve liberation.

The path to liberation is like a fire that is kindled by the friction of a stone and a piece of wood. The fire is the inner self, which is purified by the practice of austerity. The stone and the wood are the means to achieve liberation. The fire is the state of liberation, which is the ultimate goal.

Even though the pure soul, like the fire, is inherently pure, it still needs the means to achieve liberation. This is because the soul is not yet fully aware of its own true nature. The practice of austerity helps the soul to become aware of its own true nature and to achieve liberation.

**Translation of the Sanskrit verse:**

Dharma, etc., faith is Right Faith, knowledge based on the Angas is Knowledge, and effort in austerity is Conduct. This is the path to liberation.

Page #385:
---------------------------
This is a description of the **Vyavahar Moksha Marg** (practical path to liberation), which is a means to achieve the **Nischya Moksha Marg** (definitive path to liberation), as mentioned in the 105th verse.

The path to liberation is comprised of **Samyak Darshan** (right faith), **Samyak Jnana** (right knowledge), and **Samyak Charitra** (right conduct). 

**Samyak Darshan** is the belief in the six substances and nine categories of existence, and the understanding of the true nature of the **Tattva** (principles). 

**Samyak Jnana** is the knowledge of the eleven **Angas** (limbs) and fourteen **Purvas** (precepts).

**Samyak Charitra** is the practice of the twelve **Tapas** (austerities) and the various **Muni-Acharas** (conduct of the monks) as described in the **Sutras** (texts).

This path to liberation, which is based on the **Vyavahar Nay** (practical principle) and is pursued through the **Swar-Pare-Hetuk Paryaya** (self and other-motivated principles), is like a burning fire applied to a golden stone. It brings about a state of **Abhinna Vishranti** (inseparable rest) in the **Antarang** (inner self) of the **Jiva** (soul), just as a pure golden stone, though inherently pure, becomes even more refined through the process of purification.

This **Vyavahar Moksha Marg** is a means to achieve the **Nischya Moksha Marg**, even though the **Jiva**, like pure gold, is inherently pure and does not require external means for purification.

Page #386:
---------------------------
## 382
The **Mokshamarg** (path to liberation) is a comprehensive guide, a detailed explanation of the essence of **Vitarag** (free from attachment) and **Sarvjna** (omniscient) teachings. It outlines the relationship between the soul (Jiva) and other substances.  Both **Samyagdarshan** (right faith) and **Samyagjnana** (right knowledge) are common to householders and monks. However, the **charitra** (conduct) of the **sadhu** (saint) and **tapasvi** (ascetic) is defined by the **charitra granthas** (texts on conduct) like **Aacharsar** (essence of conduct). It involves the five **mahavrata** (great vows), five **samiti** (observances), three **gupti** (secrecies), and six **aavashyak** (essentials) – all in accordance with the seventh **gunasthan** (stage of spiritual progress). The **charitra** of householders, as described in the **Upasakaadhyayan Shastra** (text on householder's practice), is based on the fifth **gunasthan** and includes **daan** (charity), **sheel** (good conduct), **pooja** (worship), **upavas** (fasting), **darshan** (vision), **vrat** (vow), and other practices, totaling eleven aspects. This is the essence of the **Mokshamarg**.

This **Mokshamarg** is the foundation for the transformation of oneself and others. It involves distinct means and ends, and its understanding is based on **vyavharnay** (practical logic). Just as fire is an external means to extract gold from ore, this **Mokshamarg** is an external means to achieve **Nischyamokshamarg** (the definitive path to liberation). A **bhavy** (soul destined for liberation) who, through **Nischyanyay** (definitive logic), abandons the distinction between means and ends and focuses on the pure essence of the soul, achieving **shraddha** (faith), **jnana** (knowledge), and **anubhav** (experience) – this is the one who embraces **Nischyamokshamarg**. For them too, this **Mokshamarg** is an external means. || 160 ||

Thus, the **Nischyamokshamarg** is achieved through the **Vyavharmokshamarg**, completing the fifth **sthala** (stage).

This is the explanation of **Nischyamokshamarg** as the goal of **Vyavharmokshamarg**. The soul, united by the three principles of **Nischyanyay**, is the one who does not engage in anything else and is free from attachment – this is the **Mokshamarg**. || 161 ||

The soul, united by **Samyagdarshan**, **Samyagjnana**, and **Charitra**, is the **Nischyamokshamarg** due to its inherent nature of **Jivasvabhavaniyatcharitra** (conduct governed by the nature of the soul). Now, the one who has embraced **Vyavharmokshamarg** by abandoning **anadyavidya** (original ignorance) – their **dharmaadittvatvarthashraddha** (faith in the essence of Dharma), **angapurvagatarthajnana** (knowledge of the essence of Dharma), and **tapascheshta** (effort in austerity) – all these are abandoned and adopted for the sake of **dharmaadittvatvarthashraddha**, **angapurvagatarthajnana**, and **tapascheshta**. This is the **prarabdhaviviktabhavavyapar** (action of the soul in its state of separation from the world). The **tyagopaadaan** (abandonment and adoption) of **kutachidupaadey** (something to be taken) and **tyajyopaadaan** (something to be abandoned) are again initiated by **pratividhanaabhipraay** (intention of the soul). In this state, due to the **visishtabhavanaasousthavavashat** (power of specific contemplation), the soul, united by **Samyagdarshan**, **Samyagjnana**, and **Charitra**, becomes **samamangangi** (harmonious) and **parinatya** (transformed). This leads to **tyagopaadaanvikalpashoonyatva** (absence of the duality of abandonment and adoption) and **vishrantabhavavyapar** (action of the soul in its state of rest). This is the **suniprakamp** (unwavering) state of the soul. In this state, the soul, being **Jivasvabhavaniyatcharitra** (conduct governed by the nature of the soul), is the **Nischyamokshamarg**.

Page #387:
---------------------------
The soul which is truly united by the three (right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct), and does not do or abandon anything else, is called the path to liberation (moksha marga) with certainty. 

Therefore, the relationship between the path to liberation in conduct (vyavahar moksha marga) and the path to liberation in certainty (nishchay moksha marga) as means and end is very well established.

Page #388:
---------------------------
384
The path to liberation is the ultimate experience of the supreme art, which is the satisfaction of the taste of the nectar of death, arising from the pure self. When the soul is transformed by the unwavering faith, vision, knowledge, and conduct that are rooted in the pure self, then, by the principle of certainty, because there is no difference between the goal and the means, the soul itself becomes the path to liberation. Therefore, it is established that, just as fire is to gold and stone, the path to liberation by certainty and the path to liberation by conduct are capable of being the goal and the means.
Hindi Ta.-Uththānikā-Further, although in the previous discourse, during the time of the previous discourse, the path to liberation by certainty was explained through the two gāthās, "Jo savyasangamusko," etc., nevertheless, in order to make it clear that this path to liberation by certainty is attainable through the path to liberation by conduct, which was mentioned in the first gāthā, we continue to teach.
General meaning with Anvaya Go. A7) The soul (so) which, having attained unity with (tehiṁ) those (tihi) three (kincivi aṇṇam) does not do any other work (ṇ kuṇadi) (ṇ muydi) nor does it abandon anything, (mokkhamanggōtti) is the path to liberation, so it is said (ṇiccayanaṇeṇ).
Specific meaning-The soul which, being absorbed in right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, does not engage in emotions like anger, etc., and does not abandon the infinite knowledge, etc., which are rooted in the soul, is the essence of the path to liberation by certainty. The taste for one's own pure self is right faith, the knowledge of that is right knowledge, and the unwavering experience of that pure self is right conduct. The unity of these three is the path to liberation by certainty. The path to liberation by conduct is its means, which, due to the destruction of the desire for ignorance that arises from experience, is the essence of the three jewels. As this soul, through the practice of the path to liberation by conduct, ascends the stages of virtue, it becomes transformed into one form by experiencing the supreme art, which is the satisfaction of the taste of the nectar of happiness, which is the eternal bliss arising from the essence of its own pure self, and by being rooted in the certain right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct that are rooted in its own pure self. Then, by the principle of certainty, because there is no difference between the goal and the means, the soul itself becomes the path to liberation. From this, it is proven that, just as fire is to gold and stone, the path to liberation by certainty and the path to liberation by conduct are capable of being the goal and the means. 161.
This is the indication of the soul's conduct, knowledge, and faith. The one who walks (caradi) and does not desire (ṇādi) anything other than himself (appaṇam) (appaṇā aṇṇam-mayam). That conduct, knowledge, and faith (ṇāṇam dāsaṇ-midi) are established (ṇicchido hodi). 162.

## The one who walks, knows, and sees the Self as non-dual with the Self

**Verse 162:** The one who walks, knows, and sees the Self as non-dual with the Self, through the Self, is indeed established as Conduct, Knowledge, and Vision.

**Commentary:** This verse reveals the nature of the Self as Conduct, Knowledge, and Vision.

The one who walks, knows, and sees the Self as non-dual with the Self, through the Self, is indeed established as Conduct, Knowledge, and Vision. This means that the Self, being non-dual, is the very essence of Conduct, Knowledge, and Vision. The Self, being the doer, the action, and the instrument, is established as one and the same. Therefore, the Self, being the essence of Conduct, Knowledge, and Vision, is the path to liberation, which is characterized by the conduct of the Self, as determined by the nature of the Self.

**Anvaya:** The one (y:h) who (aatmaa) walks (caraati) the Self (aatmaanam) through the Self (aatmanaa) as non-dual (anannyamayam), knows (jaanaati), and sees (pasyaati), is (sah) indeed (niischita: bhaavati) Conduct (chaaritram), Knowledge (jnaanam), and Vision (darshanam).

**Commentary:** This verse emphasizes the non-dual nature of the Self, which is the essence of Conduct, Knowledge, and Vision. The Self, being non-dual, is the very essence of liberation. The Self, being the doer, the action, and the instrument, is established as one and the same. Therefore, the Self, being the essence of Conduct, Knowledge, and Vision, is the path to liberation, which is characterized by the conduct of the Self, as determined by the nature of the Self.

**Translation:**

The one who walks, knows, and sees the Self as non-dual with the Self, through the Self, is indeed established as Conduct, Knowledge, and Vision. This means that the Self, being non-dual, is the very essence of Conduct, Knowledge, and Vision. The Self, being the doer, the action, and the instrument, is established as one and the same. Therefore, the Self, being the essence of Conduct, Knowledge, and Vision, is the path to liberation, which is characterized by the conduct of the Self, as determined by the nature of the Self.

. The path to liberation, the index of the universe, the small, the Hindi, the date-the Uththānika-further, by the principle of non-duality, this soul itself is the form of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct, thus, they strengthen the path to liberation already mentioned.
With the meaning in the order of the words-(who) someone (by their own soul) by the soul itself (the soul form) their own soul (believes in), (knows), (conducts) acts (this) this (is decided) with certainty (right faith, knowledge, and conduct, it becomes).
Specific meaning-Whoever, becoming absorbed in the knowledge of their own self-awareness, free from attachment, sees their own inner self, free from falsehood and attachment, and united with infinite virtues like omniscience, as pure soul, in the form of pure existence, without any discrimination, or believes in the pure soul, free from opposite opinions, with the beautiful culmination of their own self-awareness, knows it through the knowledge of self-awareness, free from defilements, as different from attachment, and experiences it with complete absorption in it, that is the certainty of the three jewels. In this sutra, the soul itself is called the three forms of right faith, knowledge, and conduct, from the perspective of non-duality. From this, it is known that just as sherbet made from grapes, dates, etc., is called one, even though it is made of many things, similarly, from the perspective of non-duality, the one certainty of the three jewels is the nature of the living being, and the steady conduct is the path to liberation. This is the meaning. Similarly, in other texts, the characteristics of this certainty of the three jewels, dependent on the soul, are mentioned.
Interest in the soul is right faith-the knowledge of it is called right knowledge, and the stability of that soul itself is conduct. This is the cause of liberation, the practice of yoga. 162.
In this way, two verses are completed, mainly describing the path to liberation.
The denial of the eligibility of all beings in the world for the path to liberation. Whoever knows everything, sees everything, experiences happiness by that. Thus, knowing that, the future being, the non-future being, does not doubt. 163.
Whoever knows everything, sees everything, experiences happiness by that.
Thus, knowing that, the future being, the non-future being, does not doubt. 163. Here, happiness is due to the absence of the cause of opposition to one's nature. The nature of the soul is to know and see. The obstacle to the object of these two is opposition. In liberation, the soul sees everything, and there is no obstacle to that. Therefore, the experience of the ultimate happiness, characterized by the absence of disturbance, due to that cause, is unshakeable in liberation. This is the future being...

**Verse 387**

He who knows all (**sarvam vijanati**) and sees all (**pasyati**) when the soul is liberated, he experiences happiness (**saukhyam anubhavati**). Such a being (**bhavya**) knows this, but an unrighteous being (**abhavya**) does not believe it.

**Commentary**

This verse refutes the notion that all beings are eligible for liberation. True happiness arises from the absence of obstacles to one's inherent nature. The soul's inherent nature is perception (**drishti**) and knowledge (**jnanpti**). Obstacles to these are the cause of suffering. In liberation, the soul knows and sees everything, thus there are no obstacles. Therefore, the soul experiences the unhindered bliss of liberation, which is characterized by the absence of obstacles.

A righteous being (**bhavya**) understands this and is therefore eligible for liberation. An unrighteous being (**abhavya**) does not believe this and is therefore ineligible for liberation.

Therefore, only a few beings are eligible for liberation, not all.

**Verse 163**

Now, the text explains that one who has faith in inherent happiness is a right-seeing being (**samyagdrishti**). This being (**jiva**) knows all (**sarvam**) - the entire universe (**jagat**) across all three times (**trayakalatrayavarthi**) - with perfect knowledge (**kevalgyan**) free from doubt, error, and attachment. He not only knows but also sees (**pechchhadi**) everything with the perfect vision (**kevaldarshan**) that illuminates the universe (**lokaalokaprakashak**). He experiences happiness (**sokkham abhavati**) because of this perfect knowledge and vision. Such a being (**bhavya**) knows this, as explained earlier, and has faith in this infinite happiness (**tadananta sukham**). He experiences this happiness according to his own qualities (**svakiyagunasthananusarenam anubhavati cha**).

An unrighteous being (**abhavya**) does not believe this. For example, even though a righteous being (**bhavya**) experiences worldly pleasures (**vishayasukham**) due to the weakening of the seven vices (**mithyatvadisaptprakrti**) and the destruction of karma (**charitram ohasya ch oupashamak shayopaashamak shaye sati**), he considers the transcendental happiness (**atiindriyasukham**) arising from the realization of his pure soul (**nijasuddhatma bhavanotpannam**) as the ultimate goal. An unrighteous being (**abhavya**) does not do this. Why? Because he does not experience the destruction of karma, the weakening of the seven vices, and the perfect vision and knowledge (**darshan charitram ohaniyopaashamadhikam na sambhavati tathachaiva abhavya iti bhavartha**).

Thus, the seventh verse (**saptama sthule gatha**) primarily describes the nature of righteous and unrighteous beings (**bhavyaabhavya swaroop kathana mukhyatvena**).

**Hindi Translation**

**Uththānikā** - Further, it is shown that one who has faith in inherent happiness is a right-seeing being (**samyagdrishti**).

**Anvaya with General Meaning** - This soul (**so**) with perfect knowledge (**jena**) knows all (**savvam**) ...

The liberated soul (**vijāṇadi**) knows (**pechchhadi**) sees (**teṇa**) by that (**sokkham**) happiness (**aṇuhavdi**) experiences (**bhavīo**) the worthy soul (**taṃ**) that happiness (**idi**) in the same way (**jāṇadi**) knows (**abhavya satto**) the unworthy soul (**ṇa**) not (**sahahadi**) believes.

**Special Meaning:** This soul, by the illuminating knowledge of the omniscient, knows the three groups of objects of the three worlds, which are free from doubt, error, and indecision, and which exist in the three periods of time. And by the omniscient vision, it sees all of them together. And by those very omniscient knowledge and omniscient vision, it continuously experiences the happiness that is inseparable from them. The one who believes in this kind of infinite happiness and experiences it according to his own state of being is the worthy soul. The unworthy soul does not have such belief.

The worthy soul, with the suppression or destruction of the seven natures, including false vision, etc., and with the suppression or destruction of the conduct-delusion, according to his own state of being, experiences the happiness of the objects, even though he understands that they are worthy of being abandoned. However, he considers the transcendental happiness arising from the feeling of his pure soul to be worthy of being accepted or adopted. The reason for this is that it is not possible for him to have the suppression or destruction of the vision-delusion and the conduct-delusion, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, he is called unworthy. This is the meaning.

Thus, the seventh chapter ends with the main point of describing the nature of the worthy and the unworthy.

This shows that the nature of the soul is fixed in its conduct, and that the omniscient is the direct cause of liberation, by showing the causal relationship of vision, knowledge, and conduct. Vision, knowledge, and conduct are to be followed as the path to liberation. This is said by the virtuous, and by them, both bondage and liberation.

Vision, knowledge, and conduct are to be followed as the path to liberation. This is said by the virtuous, and by them, both bondage and liberation.

These vision, knowledge, and conduct, even if they are slightly contaminated by the influence of the other time, are held like ghee that is contaminated with a little bit of water. When they are in harmony with their own time, by the cessation of the influence of the other time, they become like ghee that is free from contamination, and they are the cause of bondage, because they are established in the relationship of cause and effect.

The five astikayas, due to the presence or absence of the cause of their existence, are themselves the direct causes of liberation. Therefore, the conduct that is inherent in the nature of the soul, which is called "svamsamayaprativritti," is established as the direct path to liberation. || 164 ||

Anvayaartha - (darshan jnana charitraani) Darshan, jnana, and charitra (mokshamārgaḥ) are the path to liberation (iti) therefore (sevitavyāni) they are worthy of being practiced - (idam sādhubhiḥ bhaṇitam) this has been said by the virtuous, (taiḥ tu) but by them (bandhaḥ vā) bondage also occurs. (mokṣaḥ vā) liberation also occurs.

Tika - Here, by showing that darshan, jnana, and charitra are sometimes the cause of bondage, the direct cause of liberation in the nature of the soul is illuminated. This darshan, jnana, and charitra, even if they are small, if they are combined with parsamayaprativritti, like ghee combined with fire, are also the cause of bondage due to the pervasiveness of the cause of the opposite action. And when (these darshan, jnana, and charitra), are combined with svamsamayaprativritti, which is the form of renunciation from all parsamayaprativritti, then, like ghee that is separated from fire, due to the absence of the cause of the opposite action, they are the direct cause of liberation. Therefore, the conduct that is inherent in the nature of the soul, which is called "svamsamayaprativritti," becomes the direct path to liberation. || 164 ||

The path to liberation (moksha) is characterized by right faith (samyakdarshan), right knowledge (samyakgyan), and right conduct (samyakcharitra). When these three jewels (ratnatraya) are rooted in the pure soul (shuddhatma), they lead to liberation. However, when they are rooted in anything other than the pure soul, they lead to bondage. 

An analogy can be drawn: just as ghee and other substances, though naturally cold, become hot due to contact with fire, similarly, these three jewels, though naturally conducive to liberation, become the cause of virtuous bondage when they are rooted in auspicious substances like the five supreme beings (panchaparameshthi). Likewise, when these same faith, knowledge, and conduct are rooted in false faith (mithyadarshan), objects of sense perception (vishaya), and passions (kṣaya), they become the cause of sinful bondage. 

Therefore, it is established that unwavering conduct rooted in the soul is the path to liberation. ||164||

Thus, the verse concludes by stating that liberation arises from pure three jewels, while virtuous bondage arises from impure three jewels.

This is an explanation of the subtle nature of the ultimate reality (parasamaya). If a knowledgeable person believes that liberation arises from pure association (shuddhasamprayoga), then that person is attached to the ultimate reality (parasamayarata). ||165||

**Translation of the Sanskrit verse:**

If a knowledgeable person believes that liberation arises from pure association (shuddhasamprayoga) due to ignorance, then that person is attached to the ultimate reality (parasamayarata). ||165||

**Commentary:**

Here, "pure association" refers to the state of mind that is imbued with devotion towards the liberated ones (arhatadi) like the Tirthankaras. If a knowledgeable person, due to a tinge of ignorance, believes that liberation arises from this pure association and strives for it, then even they are considered attached to the ultimate reality because of the presence of a tinge of passion (raga). Therefore, what about a person whose inner state is tainted by unbridled passion (nirankusha raga)? Surely, they too would be considered attached to the ultimate reality. ||165||

**Explanation of the Sanskrit terms:**

* **Moksha:** Liberation from the cycle of birth and death.
* **Samyakdarshan:** Right faith, the correct understanding of reality.
* **Samyakgyan:** Right knowledge, the true understanding of the self and the world.
* **Samyakcharitra:** Right conduct, living a life of non-violence, truthfulness, and non-attachment.
* **Ratnatraya:** The three jewels of Jainism: right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct.
* **Shuddhatma:** The pure soul, the true self.
* **Panchaparameshthi:** The five supreme beings: the Tirthankaras, the Siddhas, the Acharyas, the Upadhyayas, and the Sadhus.
* **Mithyadarshan:** False faith, a distorted view of reality.
* **Vishaya:** Objects of sense perception.
* **Kṣaya:** Passions, negative emotions like anger, greed, and pride.
* **Parasamaya:** The ultimate reality, the true nature of existence.
* **Shuddhasamprayoga:** Pure association, a state of mind characterized by devotion and purity.
* **Parasamayarata:** Attached to the ultimate reality, a state of being focused on the true nature of existence.

There are five verses following this, which explain the subtle time (sookshma parsamaya). Among them, one verse is the essence of the topic, three verses elaborate on it, and one verse summarizes it. Thus, there are nine verses in total, which are a collection of verses on the topic.

Now, the nature of subtle time is explained: If a knower (gnani) believes that liberation from suffering (dukkha mokkha) is achieved through ignorance (agnaana) rather than through devotion to the pure soul (shuddha atma), then that being (jiva) is attached to the subtle time (parasamaya). Why is this so? Because devotion (bhakti) is the association (samprayoga) with the pure (shuddha) - those who are pure in their nature (shuddha buddhak swabhaava), those who are the embodiment of pure consciousness (shuddha buddheka swabhaavaaraadhake), like the great ones (vaarhadaadi). This association (samprayoga) is pure association (shuddha samprayoga). Then, what is the state of such a being? They are attached to the subtle time (parasamaya rato). This is the knower (gnani) as described earlier.

For example, if a person desires to remain in the state of perfect equanimity (parama upeksha samyama) characterized by the contemplation of the pure soul (nirvikaar shuddhaatma bhaavana), but is unable to do so, and instead engages in devotion (bhakti) to the five great ones (pancha parameshthi) in the form of praising their qualities (gunastavanaadi), then they become attached to the subtle time (sookshma parsamaya parinata) and develop a passionate right view (saraga samyagdrishti). However, if someone, even though capable of contemplating the pure soul (shuddhaatma bhaavana), abandons it and believes that liberation (moksha) is achieved solely through good deeds (shubhopayoga), then they become attached to the gross time (sthoola parsamaya parinaama) and become an ignorant (agnaani) false believer (mithyaavrishti). Consequently, due to this ignorance (agnaana), the being (jiva) perishes.

As it is said: "Some are lost due to ignorance (agnaana), some due to carelessness (pramada), some due to the taint of knowledge (gnaanaalepa), and some are destroyed by their own actions (naashita)." || 165 ||

Page #396:
---------------------------
392
If someone becomes a **Samyagdrusti** with **Saraag** (attachment) and **Chulika** (subtle attachment) in the **Mokshamarg** (path to liberation), and if they are able to contemplate the soul, even then, they will be liberated from the world only through devotion, which is a **Shubhopayog** (beneficial use). If they believe this absolutely, then due to the subtle **Parasamaya** (ultimate time) effect, they will become ignorant and **Mithyadristi** (falsely seeing). This proves that ignorance harms the soul. It is said:

How many souls are corrupted by ignorance, how many are destroyed by carelessness, how many harm themselves by the touch of knowledge, i.e., knowledge without experience, and how many souls are destroyed by those who are themselves lost and wandering! 165.

The above **Shuddhasamprayog** (pure practice) is negated as a cause of bondage, as it is not the path to liberation. One who is endowed with devotion to **Arhat** (liberated soul), **Siddh** (liberated soul), **Chaitya** (image of an Arhat), **Pravachan** (scripture), **Gan** (group of monks), **Naaan** (knowledge), and **Bhakti** (devotion), binds much merit, but does not destroy karma. 166.

One who is endowed with devotion to Arhat, Siddha, Chaitya, Pravachan, Gan, Naaan, and Bhakti, even though he is engaged in **Shuddhasamprayog**, due to the attachment to the soul, does not abandon the **Shubhopayog** and binds much merit, but does not destroy all karma. Therefore, even a particle of attachment should be abandoned, as it is the cause of **Parasamaya** (ultimate time) activity. 166.

Meaning: One who is endowed with devotion to Arhat, Siddha, Chaitya, Pravachan, Gan, and Naaan, binds much merit, but does not actually destroy karma. 166.

Commentary: Here, the previously mentioned **Shuddhasamprayog** is negated as a cause of bondage, as it is not the path to liberation. Even though one is engaged in **Shuddhasamprayog**, due to the attachment to the soul, he does not abandon the **Shubhopayog** and binds much merit, but does not actually destroy all karma. Therefore, even a particle of attachment should be abandoned, as it is the cause of **Parasamaya** (ultimate time) activity. 166.

Summary: The above **Shuddhasamprayog** is negated as a cause of bondage, as it is not the path to liberation. One who is endowed with devotion to Arhat, Siddha, Chaitya, Pravachan, Gan, Naaan, and Bhakti, binds much merit, but does not destroy karma. 166.

This sūtra shows that the devotion to the pure soul, as mentioned earlier, leads to the bondage of karma, and thus it prohibits the attainment of liberation through it.

**General Meaning with Anvaya:** (Arhant-siddh-cheddiy-pavayan-ganna-na-bhatti-sampanno) One who is devoted to the Arhant Bhagwan, the Siddha Paramatma, their images, Jain principles, the group of Munis, and knowledge (bahusha) mostly (punnam) creates karmic bondage (bandhi) (du) but (so) he (kamp-khayam) does not destroy karma.

**Specific Meaning:** The essence of this sūtra is that liberation is attained through the experience of the pure self, free from any influx. Therefore, liberation through attachment to any object is prohibited. ||166||

**This sūtra indicates that the absence of the realization of one's own true self is solely due to attachment.** For whoever has even a tiny bit of attachment to external objects in their heart, even if they are well-versed in all the scriptures, they will not know their own true self. ||167||

**Anvaya:** (Yasyah hridaye) In whose heart (paradravyah) towards external objects (anu-matrah va) even a tiny bit (lesha-matrah bhi) [raghah] attachment (vidyate) exists (sah) he, (sarva-agam-dharah api) even if he is well-versed in all the scriptures, (svakasyah samaayam na vijanati) does not know (does not experience) his own true self.

**Commentary:** Here, the absence of the realization of one's own true self is shown to be solely due to attachment.

Whoever has even a tiny bit of attachment in their heart, even if they are well-versed in all the scriptures, they do not truly realize their pure, unattached nature and their own true self. Therefore, to realize one's true self, just as one removes cotton stuck to a wick, one must gradually eliminate even the smallest traces of attachment to external objects, including those related to Arhathood. ||167||

**It is then explained that the realization of the pure self is hindered by external objects.** For whoever has even a tiny bit of attachment to external objects, whether good or bad, in their heart and mind, they will not truly realize their own true self.

This is a passage from the Jain scripture, the Tattvartha Sutra, discussing the root cause of suffering and the path to liberation. 

**English Translation:**

**Verse 168:**

"Indeed, in this world, devotion to the Arhats (liberated souls) and others does not occur without the influence of attachment (raga). When attachment and its associated passions arise, the soul cannot be kept free from the cycle of rebirth (samsara). And when the cycle of rebirth continues, there is no restraint of auspicious and inauspicious karma. Therefore, this is the enjoyment of the affliction of attachment, which is the root of the continuous stream of suffering."

**Commentary:**

"Thus, it is taught that attachment is the root of all suffering. For one who is unable to restrain the delusion of the mind, without the awareness of one's own pure self, there is no restraint of auspicious and inauspicious karma. Why? Because there is no restraint of auspicious and inauspicious karma for one who is unable to restrain the delusion of the mind, without the awareness of one's own pure self. For example, one who does not cultivate the awareness of one's own self, which is eternally blissful and of one nature, cannot restrain the spread of the intellect, which is in the form of all the objects of knowledge, including illusion, falsehood, and the causes of suffering. And without restraint of the intellect, there is no restraint of auspicious and inauspicious karma. Therefore, it is established that attachment and its associated passions are the root of all suffering."

**Verse 169:**

"Therefore, desiring liberation, becoming free from attachment and ego, one should again cultivate devotion to the Siddhas (liberated souls). By that, one attains liberation."

**Commentary:**

"Since it has been said that attachment and its associated passions lead to delusion of the mind, and delusion of the mind leads to karmic bondage, therefore, one who desires liberation..."

The root of karma-bandha is the delusion of the mind, which is caused by the attachment to the objects of the senses. This attachment must be completely eradicated. When it is eradicated, the soul, which is free from attachment and ego, attains the true devotion to the Siddhas, which is the state of being established in the pure Self. This is the true nature of the Siddhas. Because of this, the soul, which has completely eradicated karma-bandha, attains liberation. ||169||

Anvaya-artha: Therefore, the soul, which desires liberation, becomes free from attachment and ego, and thus attains devotion to the Siddhas. Therefore, he attains liberation.

Tika: This verse explains the complete eradication of the two defects.

It was previously stated that the delusion of the mind is caused by the attachment to the objects of the senses, and that this delusion leads to karma-bandha. Therefore, the soul, who desires liberation, must completely eradicate the root of karma-bandha, which is the delusion of the mind, which is caused by the attachment to the objects of the senses. When this attachment is completely eradicated, the soul, who is free from attachment and ego, attains the true devotion to the Siddhas, which is the state of being established in the pure Self. This is the true nature of the Siddhas. Because of this, the soul, which has completely eradicated karma-bandha, attains liberation. ||169||

Therefore, the Acharya, in his explanation of the subtle paryay, concludes by saying that the soul, who desires liberation, must eradicate the root of the attachment to the objects of the senses, which is the cause of the inflow of karma. The Acharya says that the soul, who desires liberation, is free from attachment because he is free from the external and internal attachment to the objects of the senses. He is also free from ego because he is free from the delusion that arises from the attachment to the objects of the senses. He then says that the soul, who desires liberation, becomes free from attachment and ego, and thus attains devotion to the Siddhas. This devotion is the true knowledge of the Self. Because of this devotion, the soul attains liberation. ||169||

Thus, the five verses in the ninth chapter of the Tattvartha Sutra are primarily concerned with the explanation of the subtle paryay.

Hindi Ta: It is appropriate for the soul, who desires liberation, to eradicate the root of the inflow of karma, which is the attachment to the objects of the senses. Therefore, the Acharya concludes his explanation of the subtle paryay by saying: Anvaya with general meaning: [Therefore] the soul, who desires liberation, [becomes free from attachment] by being free from attachment, [and] [becomes free from ego] by being free from ego, [then] [attains devotion to the Siddhas]. In this way, he [attains liberation].

## Pancastikaya Prabhrut 397

**Special Meaning:** The four gathas starting with "Annanado Nani" explain the cause of asrava through the web of vikalpa (fluctuations) arising from raga (attachment) etc. Therefore, a person who desires liberation should be free from external and internal possessions, contrary to the essence of the soul, and free from the web of vikalpa arising from moha (delusion) which is born from the rise of mamkara (ego) and ahankara (sense of self), contrary to the luminous essence of the soul. He should consider himself as a Siddha (liberated soul) and practice Siddha bhakti (devotion to the liberated soul) in his pure spiritual qualities, believing that his soul has infinite qualities. This leads to the attainment of pure soul, which is the benefit of nirvana. || 169 ||

**Explanation:** This indicates the presence of the cause of liberation through tradition, even though there is no direct cause of liberation in the practice of parmasamaya (supreme practice) in the form of devotion to Arhat etc.

**Verse 170:**

**With meaning:** The one who has attained the knowledge of the Tirthankara, whose mind is illuminated by the sutras, and who is engaged in austerity and restraint, is still far from liberation.

**With meaning:** The one who has attained the knowledge of the Tirthankara, whose mind is illuminated by the sutras, and who is engaged in austerity and restraint, is still far from liberation.

**Explanation:** Whoever is truly motivated for liberation, even though he has acquired an inconceivable burden of austerity and restraint, and even though he has not developed the power to ascend to the state of supreme detachment, cannot abandon the practice of parmasamaya, which is attractive in the form of devotion to Arhat etc., along with the nine substances, like a piece of cotton stuck to a wick. He does not attain liberation directly, but attains it indirectly through the suffering of the heavenly realms etc. || 170 ||

**Meaning of the verse:** Even though (he is) engaged in austerity and restraint, (he has attained the knowledge of the Tirthankara) whose mind is inclined towards the nine substances and the Tirthankara, and (whose mind is illuminated by the sutras) who has a liking (love) for the sutras, for that being, (liberation) is (far away).

**Commentary:** Here, even though there is no direct cause of liberation in the practice of parmasamaya in the form of devotion to Arhat etc., the presence of the cause of liberation through tradition is shown.

The being who is truly motivated for liberation, even though he has acquired an inconceivable burden of austerity and restraint, and even though he has not developed the power to ascend to the state of supreme detachment, cannot abandon the practice of parmasamaya, which is attractive in the form of devotion to Arhat etc., along with the nine substances, like a piece of cotton stuck to a wick. He does not attain liberation directly, but attains it indirectly through the suffering of the heavenly realms etc.

## Translation:

**Panchaastikaya Prabhrut**
399

**Special Meaning:** One who is free from the defilements of attachment, aversion, and delusion due to the strength of external sensory restraint and the protection of living beings, and who, without the fire of desires like fame, worship, profit, and their mental counterparts, has become a renunciant muni by dwelling in his pure soul for the sake of self-control, and who, through the strength of various external austerities like fasting, and through the internal austerity of restraining the desire for all external objects, practices tapas in the state of eternal bliss and oneness. Even while practicing tapas, when he is unable to constantly dwell in his true nature due to the lack of special strength like endurance, he sometimes develops love for the scriptures that describe the soul and other substances, sometimes, like a man who gives gifts and honors to men who come near his wife who has gone to another country, he listens to the stories of the liberated soul, the Tirthankaras, the great beings like the Ganadharas, Bharata, Sagara, Rama, and the Pandavas, with the desire to win the liberated soul, the woman, and to avoid evil attachment and to develop love for the good Dharma. In the householder stage, he gives gifts and honors to the Acharyas, Upadhyayas, and Sadhus who are devoted to the three jewels of faith, conduct, and knowledge. Therefore, although he breaks through the cycle of endless births and deaths, if he is not a liberated soul, he cannot destroy all his karmas in that very birth. However, due to the effect of the stream of merit, he does not attain liberation in that very birth but attains the position of Indra and other deities in another birth. Even there, he considers the celestial chariots, palaces, and other glories as insignificant, and going to the five great realms, he sees the liberated, omniscient, and passionless Arhat Bhagwan in the Samavasarana and bows to the Ganadharas and other devotees of the pure soul. Then, firmly established in the pure Dharma, he does not abandon the contemplation of the soul, which is worthy of the fourth stage of spiritual development, and remains in the celestial realm until the time of his death. Then, at the end of his lifespan, he comes down from heaven and attains the glory of a Chakravarti and other kings in the human realm. Even then, due to the strength of the contemplation of the pure soul that he had in his previous births, he does not become attached to it. Then, abandoning worldly pleasures, he takes Jain initiation and, through the method of non-dualistic samadhi, he dwells in his pure soul, which is the nature of pure knowledge and vision, and attains liberation. This is the meaning. || 170 ||

**Arhadyadi Bhaktimatra Ragajanita Sakshanmokshasya Antarayadyotanamet**

**Arhat Siddha Chaitya Pravachana Bhaktah Parena Niyamen**
**Yah Karoti Tapas Karma Sa Suralogam Samadatte** || 171 ||

**Translation:**

This indicates that mere devotion to the Arhat and others is an obstacle to direct liberation, which is born of attachment.

One who is devoted to the Arhat, the liberated soul, the holy place, and the teachings, but who does not practice self-control, will attain the celestial realm. || 171 ||

One who is devoted to the Arhat, the liberated soul, the holy place, and the teachings, but who practices austerities with the intention of gaining karmic rewards, will attain the celestial realm. || 171 ||

The one who, being devoted to the Arhats, Siddhas, Chaityas (images of the Arhats), and the Pravachana (scripture), performs intense austerities with supreme restraint, is merely adorned with the taint of passion within. He is deluded by the poison of worldly objects and attains the heavenly realm, which is an obstacle to liberation. He is then cooked by the fires of passion for a long time and suffers within. || 171 ||

Anvaya: [Ya:] The one who [Arhat Siddha Chaitya Pravachana Bhakta:] is devoted to the Arhats, Siddhas, Chaityas (images of the Arhats), and the Pravachana (scripture), [Parena Niyamen:] with supreme restraint [Tapa Karma:] performs austerities [Karati:] does [Sa:] he [Suraloka:] attain the heavenly realm.

Commentary: This is a revelation of the obstacle to liberation, which is merely the passion arising from devotion to the Arhats, etc. The one who, being truly devoted to the Arhats, etc., with a mind subject to such devotion, performs intense austerities with supreme restraint, is merely adorned with the taint of passion within. He is deluded by the poison of worldly objects and attains the heavenly realm, which is an obstacle to liberation. He is then cooked by the fires of passion for a long time and suffers within. || 171 ||

Sanskrit Commentary: In the previous sutra, it was said that one who is devoted to the Tirthankaras, etc., does not attain liberation in that very life, but only acquires karmic bondage. This sutra reinforces that meaning. [Ya:] The one who [Arhat Siddha Chaitya Pravachana Bhakta:] is devoted to the Arhats, Siddhas, Chaityas (images of the Arhats), and the Pravachana (scripture), [Parena:] with supreme excellence [Y: Kश्चित् करोति:] performs something. What is that? [Tapa Karma:] Austerities. [Sa:] He [Niyamen:] by rule [Suraloka:] attains the heavenly realm. This means that he attains the heavenly realm. In this sutra, the one who, taking pure self as the object, performs liberation or vows, austerities, etc., according to the scriptures, becomes a right-view holder due to the result without cause. However, due to the lack of power to destroy karmic bondage, he is unable to remain in the state of pure self. Therefore, in the present life, he only acquires karmic bondage. In the next life, due to the constant contemplation of the Supreme Self, he attains liberation by rule. Conversely, even in the next life, there is no rule of liberation for the one who is not devoted to the Supreme Self. This is the meaning of the sutra. || 171 ||

Hindi Commentary: Uththānikā: In the previous sutra, it was said that one who is devoted to the Tirthankaras, etc., does not attain liberation in that very life, but only acquires karmic bondage. This sutra reinforces that meaning.

Anvaya with General Meaning: [Jo] The one who [Arhant Siddha Chediy Parvayan Bhatto] is devoted to the Arhant, Siddha, Arhat image, and the Jina's teachings, [Parena] with supreme excellence [Tavokamm] performs austerities, [Kunati] does [So] he [Niyamen] by rule [Suralogam] attains the heavenly realm.

Panchastikaya Prabhrit Vishesha-artha:

This sutra conveys that whoever practices vows, austerities, etc. by considering the pure soul as worthy of attainment or by understanding moksha as worthy of attainment from the language of the scriptures, is a samyagdrashti (right-visioned) with a pure intent, devoid of ulterior motives. If they do not have the appropriate strength of karmic bondage, etc., then despite being unable to stabilize in the nature of the pure soul, they still accumulate merit in the present life. In a future life, when the contemplation of the Supreme Self becomes stable, they are surely liberated. However, one who is the opposite of this does not have the rule of attaining moksha even in a future life.

In this way, two verses were completed in the tenth place, primarily through the exposition of the person who is not a charmashariri (embodied being).

This is the concluding summary of the essential meaning of the scriptures, which indicates the path to moksha. Therefore, one desirous of liberation should not have any attachment anywhere. By becoming free from attachment, the aspirant crosses the ocean of worldly existence.

The essence is that vairagya (detachment) is the direct cause of moksha. Comprehending the attachment even in the state of the Arhat, etc. as similar to the fire that burns the celestial abodes, the great one desirous of immediate liberation completely renounces all attachment, becomes absolutely detached, crosses the terrifying ocean of worldly existence scorched by the fire of karma, and attains the nectar-like ocean of the pure self.

Enough with the elaboration. There are indeed two essential meanings - the meaning of the sutra and the meaning of the scripture. The meaning of the sutra has been expounded verse by verse. The meaning of the scripture is as follows:

The essential purpose of this supreme scripture is to impart the knowledge of the tattva (reality) of moksha, which is the essence of all human goals. This is accomplished by expounding the nature of the panchastikaya (five substances) and shaddaravya (six substances), which reveals the inherent nature of all entities. It also elucidates the concepts related to bandha (bondage) and moksha, the means to moksha, the distinction between vyavahara (practical) and nischaya (absolute) moksha paths, and the supreme state of vairagya (detachment), which is the direct cause of moksha. 

This vairagya, when followed in harmony with the practical and absolute perspectives, leads to the desired fulfillment, and not otherwise. The primary aspirants, through the perspective of vyavahara, easily enter the ford, being habituated by the beginningless distinction between the means and the goal to be achieved.

Page #406:
---------------------------
This is the path to liberation, the essence of the universe, the subtle and the gross, the knowable and the unknowable. This is the path I choose, the path of the liberated.

Those who are dedicated to this path, with their minds illuminated by the understanding of the division of action, inaction, and the agent of action, gradually eradicate the roots of delusion. Sometimes, due to ignorance, pride, and carelessness, they become lax in their self-control and are subjected to severe punishments to guide them back to the righteous path. They repeatedly receive atonement for their transgressions.  Their minds, constantly purified by faith, knowledge, and conduct, are like soiled garments washed clean by the pure water flowing over a smooth stone. They gradually attain the certainty of the non-existence of the duality of means and ends, and find rest in the pure, radiant, and blissful Self, free from all the complexities of rituals and external practices.  They gradually attain the state of equanimity, transcend all attachments, and experience liberation directly.

Those who are attached to worldly affairs, however, are constantly troubled by the perception of the duality of means and ends. Their minds, filled with the seeds of faith in rituals and other beliefs, are clouded by a multitude of thoughts and doubts. They are tossed about by the waves of the ocean of rituals and practices. Sometimes they are attracted to something, sometimes they contemplate, sometimes they act, sometimes they calm down, sometimes they become agitated, sometimes they feel compassion, sometimes they become arrogant. They are constantly engaged in dispelling doubts, uncertainties, and confusion. They nurture their attachment to worldly life, and strive to maintain their position, seeking affection and influence. They observe the time for study and practice, often feigning humility, and are burdened by the weight of rituals. They are careful to maintain their wealth and reputation, and are vigilant in their conduct. They are dedicated to the five great vows of non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, non-possession, and non-attachment. They are deeply engaged in the practices of restraint and self-control. They are diligent in their speech, actions, giving, receiving, and renunciation. They are constantly striving to practice austerities, including fasting, simplicity, renunciation of taste, avoidance of company, and solitary sleep and sitting. They are disciplined by the practices of atonement, humility, non-attachment, non-indulgence, study, and meditation. They are fully engaged in the rituals and practices, driven by the desire for good karma. Even though they are primarily motivated by karma, they still acquire good karma. They are unable to even imagine the unity of knowledge, faith, and conduct, which transcends all rituals and practices. Their minds are burdened by the weight of good karma, and they continue to wander in the ocean of existence, destined to experience the suffering of the heavenly realms.

As it is said:

"Those who abandon the practice of the path, and who are attached to the world, are like those who are lost in the wilderness. They do not know the essence of the path, which is the purity of the mind."

There are two types of meaning of the *Mokshamarga Prapancha Suchi* - *Sutratatparya* and *Shastratatparya*. The *Sutratatparya* is explained in each *sutra* (each *gatha*), and the *Shastratatparya* is explained now.

The purpose of this *Yatharth Parageshwar Shastra* is to explain the essence of *Moksha* (liberation) in all *purusharthas* (goals of human life), which shows the nature of all things through the explanation of the nature of the *Panchaastikaya* (five bodies) and *Shaddravya* (six substances). It explains the nine substances in detail, revealing the *bandha* (bondage) and *moksha* (liberation) related to the *swami* (self), the *ayatan* (space) of *bandha* and *moksha*, and the *vikalpa* (difference) of *bandha* and *moksha*. It clearly explains the *Mokshamarga* (path to liberation) in the form of *nishcaya* (certainty) and *vyavahar* (practicality), and its entire heart is situated in the *paramveetraragapana* (supreme detachment) which is the cause of direct *moksha*.

Therefore, the meaning of this *veetraragapana* is to follow it without contradicting *vyavahar* and *nishcaya*, which leads to the desired success, but not otherwise.

(The above is explained in detail)

Due to the *bhedavasit buddhi* (intellect stained with differentiation) since time immemorial, the primary *jivas* (souls) follow the *vyavahar* (practical) path, taking refuge in the *bhinnsadhya sadhanabhava* (different means for different ends), and happily (easily, smoothly) descend on the *tirtham* (pilgrimage) - *Mokshamarga* (path to liberation).

For example, "(1) This is *shraddhey* (worthy of faith), (2) This is *ashraddhey* (not worthy of faith), (3) This is *shraddha karne wala* (one who has faith), and (4) This is *shraddha* (faith), (1) This is *jney* (worthy of knowing), (2) This is *ajney* (not worthy of knowing), (3) This is *jnata* (one who knows), and (4) This is *gyan* (knowledge), (1) This is *acharaniy* (worthy of conduct), (2) This is *anacharaniy* (not worthy of conduct), (3) This is *acharan karne wala* (one who conducts), and (4) This is *acharan* (conduct), (1) This is *kartavya* (worthy of doing), (2) This is *akartavya* (not worthy of doing), (3) This is *karta* (doer), and (4) This is *karma* (action)." - By observing these divisions, in which beautiful enthusiasm is aroused, they (primary *jivas*) gradually uproot *mohamalla* (attachment, etc.), and perhaps due to ignorance (lack of complete knowledge), they become overpowered by *mad* (passion) and *pramad* (carelessness), and their *atmaadhikarya* (right over the soul) becomes weak (excessive), so they use *prachand dandanetika* (penance) to guide them back to the path of justice. They continuously strive, repeatedly performing *prayaschitta* (penance) according to their faults, and through *shraddhan* (faith), *gyan* (knowledge), and *charitra* (conduct) related to different subjects (through these three gems of differentiation), they gradually acquire *sanskar* (impressions) in their souls. Like a dirty cloth that is beaten on a stone surface by a washerman, soaked in clean water, and rubbed with *kshar* (soap), they gradually achieve purity (cleanliness) in their souls. Due to the absence of *bhinnsadhya sadhanabhava* (different means for different ends) of *nishchayanaya* (certainty), they find rest (stability) in the *bhagwan atma* (divine soul), which is the form of the combined nature (non-differentiation) of *darshan* (perception), *gyan* (knowledge), and *charitra* (conduct), which is free from the pomp of rituals (due to the absence of rituals), is extremely pure and conscious, and is full of independent joy.

Page #409:
---------------------------
From the five astikayas onwards, up to the 405th, the feeling of samarasibhava gradually arises. Therefore, by attaining the supreme state of vitraragabhava, they experience liberation directly. 

This is called the **pravartan** (action) and its **phala** (fruit) of the **kevalavyavaharabalambi** (ignorant) beings. 

However, those who are **kevalavyavaharabalambi**, by observing the **bhitrasadhyasadhanabhava** (the nature of the means to attain liberation), constantly experience great **khed** (regret). 

(1) Due to their mind being constantly engaged in **shraddhanarupa adhyavasana** (firm determination) in **dharma** (righteousness) etc., 

(2) Their **chaitanyavritti** (consciousness) becomes **chitra-vichitra** (diverse) due to the **jal** (net) of **vichitra** (various) **vikalpas** (thoughts) arising from the **sanskaras** (impressions) of **dravya-shruta** (scriptural knowledge), and 

(3) They remain **achalita** (immobile) in the **dharmar** (pomp) of **pravartanarupa karmakanda** (ritualistic practices) which are like **tan** (grass) in the form of **samudaya** (collection) of **yati-acharale** (conduct of monks). 

Therefore, they sometimes take **ruchi** (interest) in something, sometimes **vikalpa** (consider) something, sometimes engage in some **acharan** (conduct), sometimes become **prashamta** (calm) for the sake of **darshanacharan** (seeing and practicing), sometimes attain **sanveg** (enthusiasm), sometimes become **anukampita** (compassionate), sometimes **dharan** (hold) **astikya** (faith), and constantly strive to prevent the rise of **shanka** (doubt), **kanksha** (desire), **vichchikittsa** (hesitation), and **muddhadrishtita** (ignorance). 

They repeatedly increase their **utsaha** (enthusiasm) by **bha** (considering) **upabrinhana** (strengthening), **sthitikaran** (stabilizing), **vatsalya** (affection), and **pravana** (inclination). 

They observe the **avlokan** (observation) of **svadhyayakal** (time for self-study) for the sake of **jnanaacharan** (knowledge and practice). 

They **vistar** (expand) **vinaya** (humility) in many ways. 

They **dharana** (hold) **durdhar** (difficult) **upadhana** (accessories). 

They **prasarita** (spread) **bahuman** (respect) properly. 

They **nivarta** (prevent) **nihrvadoosha** (faults) completely. 

They are extremely **savadhan** (careful) in the **shuddhi** (purity) of **artha** (meaning), **vyanjan** (pronunciation), and **tadubhaya** (both). 

For the sake of **charitraacharan** (conduct of character), they remain **talliin** (immersed) in the **panchamahavrata** (five great vows) of **sarvaviratirupa** (complete renunciation) of **himsa** (violence), **asatya** (falsehood), **steya** (theft), **abrahma** (sexual misconduct), and **parigraha** (possession). 

They are extremely **udyoga** (industrious) in **gupti** (secrets) whose **lakshana** (characteristic) is **samyak yoganigraha** (proper control of the senses). 

They **yukta** (apply) **prayatna** (effort) completely in **samiti** (groups) of **irya** (walking), **bhasha** (speech), **eshana** (desire), **adananiksepa** (giving and receiving), and **utsarga** (abandonment). 

For the sake of **tapaacharan** (practice of austerities), they remain constantly **utsahi** (enthusiastic) in **anashan** (fasting), **avamoudarya** (moderation), **vrittiparisankhyan** (counting of breaths), **rasaparitaya** (renunciation of taste), **vivikta-shayyasan** (solitary bed and seat), and **kayaklesha** (physical austerities). 

They **ankushita** (control) their own **anta:karan** (inner mind) through **prayashchitta** (penance), **vinaya** (humility), **vaiyavritti** (conduct of a monk), **vyutsarga** (abandonment), **svadhyay** (self-study), and **dhyan** (meditation). 

For the sake of **viryaacharan** (conduct of effort), they remain **sarva shakti vyapt** (all-powerful) in **karmakanda** (ritualistic practices). 

While doing so, due to their **karmachetnapraadhanapana** (being dominated by karma), although they have completely **nivarana** (prevented) the **ashubhakarmapravritti** (tendency towards evil karma), they have **grahana** (accepted) the **shubhakarmapravritti** (tendency towards good karma) well. 

However, they do not **utpanna** (generate) even a little **jnana-chetna** (knowledge-consciousness) which is the **aikyaparinaati** (unified result) of **darshan** (vision), **jnana** (knowledge), and **charitra** (conduct), transcending the **adambar** (pomp) of all **kriyakanda** (actions). 

They live with a **mand** (dull) **chittavritti** (mind) burdened by **bahu punya** (much merit). 

Due to the **parampara** (tradition) of attaining **klesha** (afflictions) of **devaloka** (heavenly realms) etc., they **bhraman** (wander) in the **sansarsagar** (ocean of existence) for a very **dirghakal** (long time). 

It is also said:

**"Charan-karan-ppahana samaya-par-matthamuk-ka-va-vara | Charan-karan-ssa saram nicchaya-sud-dhan jananti ||"**

**Meaning:** Those who are **charan-karan** (action-oriented) and

**The Path to Liberation: A Guide to the Worldly (Now, the conduct and its fruits of the ignorant beings who are only dependent on conviction are described.)**

Now, those who are only dependent on conviction, while being detached in their intellect from the pomp and show of all rituals, keep their eyes downcast and remain at ease by observing everything with their own intellect (i.e., they remain as they wish by imagining anything according to their own mental constructs), they actually reject the nature of means that are difficult to achieve and do not attain the nature of means that are easily achievable. They remain in the middle (i.e., in the third state of evil, apart from the good and pure), intoxicated with the intoxication of negligence, with a lazy mind, like the intoxicated, like the unconscious, like the sleeping, like those who have attained satisfaction after eating a lot of ghee, sugar, and kheer (i.e., satisfied), with sluggishness (i.e., slowness, inactivity) arising due to a fat body, with terrible intellectual delusion, with stupidity, whose specific consciousness has been extinguished, like a plant, not relying on the karma-consciousness of the Muni-Indra out of fear of the bondage of merit, and not attaining rest in the knowledge-consciousness of ultimate non-action (only) subject to manifest and unmanifest negligence, with the tendency of the consciousness of the light (inferior) karmic fruits obtained, which prevails in them, like a plant, they only bind themselves to sin. It is also said that: "Those who rely on conviction, but do not know conviction (in reality), are lazy in external conduct and destroy the results of conduct."

** (Now, the conduct of the knowledgeable beings who act according to the ground, with the harmony of both conviction and conduct, is described.)**

But those who are great souls, always striving for non-rebirth (liberation), not relying on only one of conviction and conduct (i.e., not being only dependent on conviction or only dependent on conduct), being extremely moderate, facing the creation of rest in the pure consciousness-like self-principle, preventing the rise of negligence, with the greatness of the transformation of the ritualistic conduct that follows the rise of negligence, remaining extremely indifferent, as far as possible, experiencing the self with the self in the self, always remaining appropriate, they (i.e., those great souls) actually renounce karma gradually according to the rest in their own nature, remaining extremely free from negligence, being extremely still, to whom the simile of a plant is given, yet who have completely eradicated (destroyed) the experience of karmic fruits, remaining indifferent to the experience of karma, being completely filled with the essential joy arising from the experience of knowledge, quickly crossing the ocean of the world, become the enjoyers of the eternal fruits (i.e., the bliss of Nirvana) of the word-Brahman. || 172 ||

This text states that the essence of the Pancastikaya Prabhruta Shastra is freedom from attachment (Vitaraga). Therefore, since this text shows the path to liberation (Moksha) as being freedom from attachment, a person who desires liberation (Ninchudika) should not be attached to anything at all. By being free from attachment (Vitaraga), he becomes free from attachment (Vitaraga) through the absence of attachment (Raga). A worthy being (Bhavya) crosses the ocean of existence (Bhavasagara). For example, since this Shastra shows freedom from attachment (Vitaraga) as the essence of the explanation of the path to liberation (Moksha), a worthy being (Bhavya) who desires liberation (Moksha) and is characterized by the term "Samayasara" which signifies the manifestation of infinite qualities like perfect knowledge (Kevalgyana) and who is a worthy being (Arhada) etc., should not be attached to his own perception (Samvitti). By being free from attachment (Vitaraga) through the light of pure consciousness (Niruparaga Chijjyoti), he attains liberation (Moksha) which is characterized by infinite knowledge (Anantgyana) etc., and transcends the ocean of existence (Samsarasagara) which is ignited by the flames of the tree of suffering (Vadavanalasikha) and is filled with the salty water of suffering (Ksharanira) which is the obstacle to the enjoyment of the sweet taste of supreme bliss (Paramananda) which is the only form of happiness (Sukharasa) and is filled with the salty water of suffering (Ksharanira) which is the obstacle to the enjoyment of the sweet taste of supreme bliss (Paramananda) which is the only form of happiness (Sukharasa) and is filled with the salty water of suffering (Ksharanira) which is

**Index of the Path to Liberation, Chapter, with Commentary**

(Therefore) because (he is desireless) he who is devoid of desire (in all things) does not have any (attachment) in any of the objects (he is a worthy being) that worthy being (for this reason) becomes (freed from attachment) freed from attachment (and crosses) crosses the ocean of existence.

**Special Meaning:** Because this scripture, in relation to the explanation of the path to liberation, shows the path to liberation as the state of being freed from attachment, which is the light of pure consciousness without any attributes, therefore, the worthy being who desires liberation, which is worthy of being spoken of in terms of the essence of time, the manifestation of infinite qualities like perfect knowledge, etc., does not have any attachment in the form of self-experience even in the Arhats, etc. - because of this state of pure consciousness, which is free from attachment and luminous, that being, freed from attachment, crosses the ocean of existence and attains liberation, which is the form of infinite knowledge and other qualities. This ocean of existence is the opposite of the eternal and imperishable, it is filled with various kinds of aquatic beings in the form of birth, old age, death, etc., it is full of the bitter water of hellish suffering, which prevents the enjoyment of the one taste of supreme bliss, which is free from attachment, it is full of the chain of waves of all auspicious and inauspicious choices, which are the objects of the five senses, which destroy the supreme concentration, which is free from choices like attachment, etc., and within which the peak of the great fire of various kinds of mental suffering, which causes agitation, is burning, instead of the supreme bliss, which is free from agitation.

In this way, as mentioned earlier, the meaning of this scripture should be understood as liberation from attachment. That liberation from attachment is achieved through both the theoretical and practical aspects, which are mutually dependent on each other - liberation cannot be achieved in isolation without dependence. The meaning of this is that those who, without any dependence on the path to liberation, which is the theoretical aspect of pure knowledge, vision, and the nature of the pure self, which is the nature of the pure self, only consider the practical aspect of auspicious conduct as the path to liberation, they, with this understanding, only experience the suffering of the heavenly realms, etc., and continue to wander in this world through tradition. But those who believe that the path to liberation is the experience of the pure self, and when they do not have the power to practice the path to liberation in theory, then they follow the auspicious conduct, which is the means of achieving the theoretical aspect, then they are those who have right vision with attachment, and then they attain liberation through tradition. In this way, two statements have been made, mainly to refute the isolated aspect of practice, and those who, taking the theoretical aspect in isolation, do not attain the benefit of the pure self, which is the supreme concentration, free from choices like attachment, etc., but still follow the six essential practices, such as Samayika, etc., which are worthy of the conduct of an ascetic, and the practice of giving, etc., which is worthy of the conduct of a lay follower,

Page #413:
---------------------------
The **Pancastikaya** (Five Principles) refutes the **402** practices like worship, etc. They are corrupted in both **knowledge** and **conduct**, and they do not know any state other than the state fit for **knowledge** and **conduct**, thus they bind themselves to **sin**. Those who consider the **knowledge** of the pure soul as the path to **liberation** and the **conduct** of the pure soul as the path to **liberation**, are considered to be on the path to **liberation**. However, due to the rise of **attachment** to **conduct**, they are not equal to those who follow the pure **conduct** with the expectation of the feeling of the pure soul from both good and bad **conduct**, even though they are not able to do so. Nevertheless, such **right-seeing** individuals, who are engaged in **charity**, **worship**, etc., with **attachment** to **right-belief**, etc., attain **liberation** through tradition. Thus, by refuting the **isolation** of **knowledge**, two statements are made, which proves that **knowledge** and **conduct** are worthy of being considered as **means** and **ends** to each other. Through this, the **knowledgeable** soul attains **liberation** only by the power of **supreme meditation** free from **attachment**, etc. || 172 ||

Thus, the statement is made by **contracting** the meaning of the **scripture**. In this way, the **verse** is spoken in the eleventh place, mainly describing the meaning of what was said in five statements.
**The indication of the affirmation of the doer is to be completed. I have spoken the essence of the discourse, the **Pancastikaya** collection, the **sutra**, to inspire the **path**, the **effect**, and the **devotion** to the **discourse**. || 173 ||
**The essence of the discourse, the **Pancastikaya** collection, the **sutra**, was spoken by me, inspired by the **devotion** to the **discourse**, for the purpose of **influencing** the **path**. || 173 || The **path** is the supreme **command** of the **divine**, which is inclined towards the making of supreme **detachment**. Its **influence** is the **manifestation** through **propaganda** or the **raising** through the **excellent** **result**. For this purpose, the **sutra** is spoken by me, which is the essence of the **discourse**, which is very extensive, being indicative of all the **truths** of the **things**, being **moved** by the **heart** **flowing** with the **supreme** **faith**. This is because it is known to the **omniscient** **Lord**. Thus, the **author** of the **scripture**, having reached the end of what was begun, becomes completely **fulfilled** and rests in the pure **form** of **supreme** **non-action**. || 173 || Thus, the **second** **Shrutakhanda** ends with the **description** of the **path** to **liberation** with the **nine** **categories** of **objects** in the **time** **explanation**. ||
This **time** **explanation** of the **Pancastikaya** collection is completed with the **explanation** of the **truths** of the **things** accumulated by one's own **power**. There is nothing to be done for the **hidden** **form** of the **immortal** **moon** **sun**. || 8 ||

'Mārga - the supreme detachment, is the name of the supreme command of the skillful and efficient Paramēśvari, which is to be illuminated by its influence and proclamation, or by its excellent culmination, for that purpose ( - for the purpose of influencing the path), I, who was very agitated in my mind with the speed of attachment from the side of the supreme āgama, said this sūtra called 'Panchaastikayasangraha' - which is a 'sūtra' because it was taught by the omniscient Lord (first time taught), and because it is the proponent of the essence of all things (the true nature of all things) in brief, it is also the essence of a very extensive discourse.

For the purpose of influencing the path. Thus - Mokshamārga is the experience of the pure self, characterized by detachment from the body, the world, and enjoyment. Its influence is its own experience and the revelation of it to others. For that purpose, I, the doer, inspired by the devotion of the supreme āgama, have explained this Panchaastikayasāstra. What is its characteristic? Because of its brief explanation of the Panchaastikayashadtravyādi, it is the essence of the discourse of the Dvādaśāṅga.

## Translation:

The eight limbs of yoga, namely, **Mokshamarga**, **Prapancha**, **Suchika**, **Chulika**, **Yada**, **Yatha**, **Iti**, and **Ashtaanga**, are the means of achieving liberation. A concise explanation of these is given in the **Tattvanushaasanadhyaana** text as follows: "When the mind, senses, and object of meditation are still, one-pointed concentration is called **dhyana**. The fruit of **dhyana** is the destruction of **samvara** and **nirjara."

There are three types of meditators and meditations, namely, **jghanya**, **madhyama**, and **utkrista**, as explained in the **Tattvanushaasanadhyaana** text. This is also evident from the term **tiyo** (third) in the **Maaranekala** text, which refers to the **dhyanasamgri** (materials of meditation) as being of three types: **jghanya**, **madhyama**, and **utkrista**.

Alternatively, in a very concise way, there are two types of meditators: those who begin with **shuddhaatmabhavana** (meditation on the pure self) are called **prarambhayogi** (beginner yogis) and those who attain the **nirvikalpa** (without modifications) **shuddhaatma** (pure self) state are called **nishpannayogi** (accomplished yogis).

In the language of **adhyatma** (spiritual knowledge), the meditator, meditation, and object of meditation are to be understood as **samvaranirjara** (destruction of **samvara** and **nirjara**), **sadhakara** (means of achieving liberation), and **vikalparahita** (without modifications), respectively. The fruits of meditation are sevenfold: **paramananda** (supreme bliss), **ekalakshanasukha** (bliss characterized by oneness), **vridhi** (increase), **nirvikarasvasamvedana** (awareness of the self without modifications), **jnaanavridhi** (increase in knowledge), **buddhi** (intellect), and **saptathir** (sevenfold).

Furthermore, the characteristics of the meditator mentioned elsewhere, as described by teachers and those who have completed their practice, are to be considered as included here.

Now, the stages of a **ghatakala** (one who destroys the karmas) are explained in the language of **agama** (Jain scriptures). When someone, with the intention of practicing the fourfold **radhana** (spiritual practices), becomes free from the **acharya** (spiritual teacher) and **parigraha** (attachment), and receives **jindiksha** (initiation into Jainism), then after initiation, they receive instruction in the **achara** (conduct), **radhana** (spiritual practices), **charana** (conduct), **karan** (action), and **grantha** (scriptures) to understand the fourfold **radhana**. After receiving this instruction, they practice the **charana** and **karan** as explained in the scriptures, and with the help of **vyakhyana** (explanation), they nurture their **shiष्यगण** (group of disciples) with **panchabhavana** (five types of meditation). This is called the **ganaposhanakala** (stage of nurturing disciples).

The five types of **bhavana** (meditation) are: **tapobhavana** (meditation on austerity), **shrutabhavana** (meditation on scriptures), **sattvabhavana** (meditation on virtue), **ekatvabhavana** (meditation on oneness), and **santoshabhavana** (meditation on contentment).

**Tapobhavana** is the practice of twelve types of austerities, including **anashana** (fasting). Its fruit is the conquest of **kṣaya** (passions) and **viṣaya** (objects of sense).

**Shrutabhavana** is of four types: **prathamaniyoga** (study of the first **niyoga**), **charananiyoga** (study of the **charana**), **karananiyoga** (study of the **karan**), and **dravyaniyoga** (study of the **dravya**). **Prathamaniyoga** is the study of the **trishatshashtilaka** (63 **shalaka**), **purusha** (soul), and **purana** (ancient history). **Charananioga** is the study of the **upasaka** (lay follower), **adhyayana** (study), **charara** (conduct), **radhana** (spiritual practices), and other scriptures, as well as the **deshacharitra** (conduct of the land) and **sakalacharitra** (complete conduct). **Karananiyoga** is the study of the **jinantara** (other **tirthankaras**), **triloka** (three worlds), **saraloka** (all worlds), **vibhagaloka** (division of worlds), **lokaniyoga** (allocation of worlds), and other scriptures. **Dravyaniyoga** is the study of the **praabhrutattva** (fundamental principles), **arthasiddhanta** (philosophy of reality), and other scriptures, as well as the **jiva** (soul), **dravya** (substance), and other topics. The fruit of **shrutabhavana** is the removal of doubt, delusion, and confusion regarding the **jiva** and other **tattva** (principles), or the knowledge of **heyopadeya** (what is to be abandoned and what is to be accepted).

It is said: "The **samvara** (restraint) of the **bhavana** (meditation) that is for the benefit of the self, the ninefold **samvega** (spiritual enthusiasm), **ni:kampata** (steadiness), **tapobhavana** (meditation on austerity), and the teaching of others are the fruits of **shrutabhavana**."

**Sattvabhavana** is the practice of **mulottaraguna** (virtues) and other **anushtana** (practices), and its fruit is the ability to achieve liberation even in the face of severe **upasarga** (obstacles) and **parishaha** (hardships), as exemplified by the **Pandavas**.

**Ekatvabhavana** is the meditation on oneness, as expressed in the following verse: "My self is one, characterized by **nana** (knowledge) and **darshana** (vision). All other things are external, characterized by **sanjoga** (association)." The fruit of **ekatvabhavana** is the removal of delusion regarding oneself, others, and everything else.

It is said: "Just as a wise person, seeing their

## The Fivefold Body and the Six Stages of Time

**The Fivefold Body (Panchaastikaya) and the Six Stages of Time (Shatkala) are not applicable to the 413 (referring to a specific text or section).**

**The meaning here is:** "From the beginning, the middle, and the end, the knowledge, the conduct, and the fivefold body, the beginning, the middle, and the end, the restraint, the yoga," and so on.

**Where the explanation is in accordance with the three jewels of non-duality (Abhedaratnatraya) as explained in the essence of the scriptures (Agamasara), that is called Adhyatma Shastra (spiritual science).** The six stages of time are explained briefly in relation to this.

**Where the three jewels of non-duality, the nature of the six substances (Shatdravya), right faith (Samyak Shraddha), and the different types of vows (Navrata) are explained, that is called Agama Shastra (scriptural science).** This is the external means of achieving the internal practice of the three jewels of non-duality. The six stages of time are also explained briefly in relation to this.

**Specifically, the detailed explanation of both should be understood from other texts according to the order explained by the previous teachers.**

**This is the summary of the commentary (Tatparyavritti) by Acharya Jayasena.**

**First, the first major section (Mahaadhikari) is called "Panchaastikaya Shatdravya Praatipadaka" (Explaining the Fivefold Body and the Six Substances), which consists of 111 verses and eight sub-sections (Antaradhikari).**

**Then, the second major section is called "Navapadarth Praatipadaka" (Explaining the Nine Categories of Objects), which consists of 50 verses and ten sub-sections.**

**Then, the third major section is called "Aashthala Ikshiswaroop Mokshamarg Praatipadaka" (Explaining the Eight Stages, the Nature of the Seer, and the Path to Liberation), which consists of 20 verses.**

**Thus, the Fivefold Body (Panchaastikaya) is completed with a total of 181 verses in three major sections.**

**This commentary (Tatparyavritti) on the Fivefold Body (Panchaastikaya) is completed on the 1st day of the bright fortnight of Ashwin, Vikram Samvat 1369 (corresponding to October 13, 1412 CE).**

**Now, the commentator says that this summary of the Fivefold Body (Panchaastikaya) is explained for the benefit of the interested student (Ruchidhari Shishya).**

**At the time of receiving education, one is called a student (Shishya).** Therefore, to explain the characteristics of a student, the different stages of initiation or education of those who worship the Supreme Soul (Paramatma) are explained.

**There are six stages of time (Shatkala):**

1. **Deekshakal (Initiation Stage):** When a near-liberated soul (Bhavyajiva) who has attained the three jewels of certainty (Nishchay) and conduct (Vyavahar) approaches the Acharya (teacher) and renounces external and internal possessions to receive Jain initiation, this is the initiation stage.

2. **Shikshakala (Education Stage):** After initiation, when one receives education in the scriptures (Adhyatma Shastra) to gain deeper knowledge of the three jewels of certainty and conduct, as well as the nature of the Supreme Soul (Paramatma), this is the education stage.

3. **Ganpooshanakala (Nourishing the Group Stage):** After education, when one remains steadfast in the path of liberation (Mokshamarg) and nourishes the near-liberated souls (Bhavyaprana) who are seeking the path of liberation by teaching them the truth of the Supreme Soul (Paramatma), this is the nourishing the group stage.

4. **Atmasanskarkala (Self-Refinement Stage):** After nourishing the group, when one renounces their group (Gan) or community (Sangha) and refines their own nature (Atmaswabhav) by dwelling in their true nature, this is the self-refinement stage.

##  Chapter 424: The Path to Liberation - A Detailed Explanation

**5. Sallekhana:** After self-purification, Sallekhana is a state of being where one dwells in the state of the Supreme Soul, free from passions like anger and possessing infinite knowledge and other qualities. It involves a gradual reduction of attachments and desires.  **Kayaklesha Sallekhana** involves intentionally causing physical discomfort and emaciation. The period during which these practices are undertaken is known as the **Sallekhana period**.

**6. Uttamārtha Kāla:** After Sallekhana, the practice of **Tapascharya** (austerity) involves four aspects: 
* **Shraddhā** (faith) in the true nature of the soul as pure knowledge and perception.
* **Jnāna** (knowledge) of the soul's true nature.
* **Āchār** (conduct) aligned with this knowledge.
* **Nirodha** (restraint) of desires for external objects.

This practice is undertaken for liberation in the current life for those who are **Charamashariri** (those who are destined to attain liberation in this life). For those who are not Charamashariri, it helps them attain the necessary qualifications for liberation in a future life. This period is known as **Uttamārtha Kāla**.

These six periods (**Sallekhana Kāla** and **Uttamārtha Kāla**) are not necessarily experienced sequentially. Some may attain **Kevalajnāna** (perfect knowledge) during the first period, others during the second, and so on.

**Dhyāna (Meditation):**

There are eight aspects of meditation:

* **Dhyātā** (the meditator)
* **Dhyāna** (the act of meditation)
* **Phalam** (the fruit of meditation)
* **Dhyeyam** (the object of meditation)
* **Yatra** (where to meditate)
* **Yasyam** (when to meditate)
* **Yathā** (how to meditate)
* **Āsana** (the posture)

**A concise explanation:**

* **Dhyātā** is one who controls their senses and mind.
* **Dhyeyam** is the true nature of reality.
* **Dhyāna** is focused contemplation.
* **Phalam** is the attainment of **Samvara** (control over passions) and **Nirjara** (elimination of karmic impurities).

This is explained in detail in the text **Tattvanushasan** which also describes three types of **Dhyātā** and three types of **Dhyāna** based on the quality of the meditator. This is due to the fact that the materials of meditation (**dravya**, **kshetra**, **kāla**, **bhāva**) are also of three types.

**Two types of meditators:**

* **Prarabdha Yogi:** Those who are in the initial stages of meditation, with subtle **vikalpa** (fluctuations of mind).
* **Nishpanna Yogi:** Those who have attained a state of pure consciousness, free from **vikalpa**.

In summary, one should understand the **Dhyātā**, **Dhyāna**, **Dhyeyam**, and **Phalam** of meditation in the language of spirituality. The fruit of meditation is the attainment of **Samvara** and **Nirjara**, leading to the growth of **paramānanda** (supreme bliss) free from passions and fluctuations.

Panchalika is the attainment of the knowledge of the five types of liberation, which is free from the cycle of birth and death and is free from change, and the attainment of the seven types of supernatural powers, such as intellect. _Other texts also describe three types of meditators. For example, the disciple, the beginner, the practitioner, and the accomplished yogi. Their description should also be understood as being included in this statement as much as possible. Now, according to the language of the Agamas, there are six periods of time_
1- When someone, in the presence of the four types of right faith, knowledge, conduct, and penance, goes to an Acharya who is the guardian of the five vows, and renounces internal and external possessions, and takes the Jain initiation, that is the period of initiation.
2- After initiation, when one learns from the scriptures that are helpful for the practice of the four types of penance and for the practice of conduct, that is the period of education.
3- After education, when one nourishes the disciples by practicing the teachings that are helpful for conduct, and by explaining them, with the five types of contemplation, that is the period of nourishing the community.
There are five types of contemplation: penance, scripture, character, unity, and contentment.
1- To perform the twelve types of pure penance, such as fasting, is the contemplation of penance. The fruit of this contemplation is victory over the senses and passions.
2- To study the four types of Agamas, namely, the Pratyamanuyoga, the Charanamanuyoga, the Karanamanuyoga, and the Dravyamanuyoga, is the contemplation of scripture. The explanation of the Puranas of the thirty-six types of men is the Pratyamanuyoga. The explanation of the conduct of the country and the conduct of all beings through the scriptures of the study of the object of worship and the practice of conduct is called the Charanamanuyoga. The explanation of the world through the Jinantar, the Trilokasar, the division of the world, etc., is the Karanamanuyoga. The explanation of the six substances, such as the soul, and the seven principles, through the Prabhrit, i.e., the Samayaprabhrit, etc., and the Tattvarthasutra, etc., is the Dravyamanuyoga. The fruit of the contemplation of this scripture is that there is a firm conclusion without doubt, delusion, or confusion regarding the relationship of the soul and other principles, or regarding the principle that is to be abandoned or the principle that is to be attained. The fruit of the contemplation of this scripture is said in other texts:
"The contemplation of penance, which is for the benefit of the self, is a new and fresh impulse. The contemplation of penance is the teaching of the other, the knowledge of the other."

## The Path to Liberation: A Guide to Jain Principles

**Index of Concepts and Their Meanings**

**1. Understanding the Scriptures:** A person who understands the scriptures gains six benefits:

(1) **Faith in Self-Benefit:**  They develop strong faith in the benefits of following the path.
(2) **Control of Inflows:** They control the influx of karmic matter.
(3) **Growth in Dharma:** They continuously grow in their adherence to the principles of Dharma.
(4) **Effortless Results:** They achieve their goals effortlessly.
(5) **Desire for Austerity:** They develop a strong desire to practice austerities.
(6) **Ability to Teach Others:** They become capable of teaching others.

**2. Fearless Conduct:**  Fearless conduct in upholding the fundamental and secondary virtues is known as **Sattva-Bhavana**. This leads to unwavering courage and enthusiasm in pursuing liberation, even in the face of severe hardships and trials, like the Pandavas.

**3. Oneness with the Soul:**  Recognizing the soul as a singular, eternal entity, characterized by knowledge and perception, is **Ekatva-Bhavana**. As stated in the scripture:

"My soul is one, alone, imperishable, possessing the qualities of knowledge and perception. All other experiences, arising from external connections, are external to me."

This leads to detachment from both loved ones and strangers, as stated:

"Just as a wise person, possessing Ekatva-Bhavana, does not become attached even when witnessing the mockery of his sister, so too, a Jina-follower does not become attached."

**4. Contentment:**  Maintaining equanimity in the face of praise and blame, and finding contentment in whatever benefits one receives, such as food and drink, is **Santasha-Bhavana**. This leads to liberation from the cycle of birth and death, as it allows one to experience the supreme bliss of the soul, free from the attachments of worldly pleasures.

**5. Self-Transformation:**  A person who desires to transform their soul through the practice of **Gana-Poshana** (nurturing the community) may leave their current group and join another group or monastic order. This is known as **Atma-Sanskara-Kala** (the time of self-transformation).

**6. Self-Discipline:**  During **Atma-Sanskara-Kala**, one practices self-discipline through adherence to the principles outlined in the scriptures, including the practice of **Sallekhana** (voluntary fasting unto death). This is known as **Sallekhana-Kala** (the time of self-discipline).

**7. Ultimate Goal:**  After **Sallekhana**, one completes the final stage of their journey through meditation and other practices, guided by the four types of **Aradhana** (worship). This is known as **Uttam-Artha-Kala** (the time of the ultimate goal).

The five astikayas, starting with the first, attain four types of worship in the beginning itself. There is no rule of six times. Here, the meaning is that the scripture which explains the essence of the Agamas, taking the evidence of the verses written below, in accordance with the feelings of the three jewels, with words and meanings, is called Adhyatma Shastra.  "My soul is in my knowledge, my soul is in my vision, my soul is in my conduct. My soul is in my renunciation, my soul is in my detachment, my soul is in my yoga."  - This means that wherever the soul is, all these things are there.  The description of the six times, based on the Adhyatma Shastra, has already been done briefly.  The scripture which describes the nature of the three jewels, in the form of faith, knowledge, and conduct, of the six substances, etc., spoken by the omniscient, free from passions, is called Agama Shastra.  This statement is the external means of spiritual conduct based on the three jewels.  The six times are also mentioned briefly based on this.  If you want to know more, it is worth knowing the explanation of the six times, in both Agama and Adhyatma forms, from other scriptures, according to the order spoken by the previous Acharyas.  In this way, the first Maha Adhikar, which speaks of the five astikayas and six substances, through eight internal chapters, in one hundred and eleven verses, is called Tatparya Vritti, written by Shri Jayasenacharya.  After that, the second Maha Adhikar, which speaks of nine substances, through ten internal chapters, in fifty verses, is called.  Then, the third Maha Adhikar, which speaks of the nature of liberation and the path to liberation, through twelve locations, in twenty verses, is called.  In this way, the five astikayas, starting with the first, are completed in one hundred and eighty-one verses, in three chapters.  There are 173 verses in the time explanation.
