Aindra shreninataha shrimannandatannabhinandanah. Uddghara yugadou yo jagadanjnapankaatah. ||1||
Meaning: May Shri Nabhinandan Rishabhdev Bhagwan, who has rescued the world from the mud of ignorance at the beginning of the age, i.e., who has dispelled the darkness of ignorance of the world with the light of his knowledge like the sun, be pleased (with me). ||1||
Shri Shantistaantibhid bhuyaad bhavinam mrigalanchanah. Gavaha kuvalayollaasam kurvate yasya nirmalaah. ||2||

---------------------------
I praise the glorious Śrī Śaiva, the Jina, who filled the three worlds with his fame, as if by the wind emanating from his mouth, he blew the Pañcajanya conch. ||3||

Meaning: I praise Śrī Nemināth Bhagavān, the son of Śiva and Devī, who, with the wind emanating from his mouth, blew the Pañcajanya conch, as if filling the three worlds with his brilliant fame. ||3||

May he who, at one time, had his reflection cast on the tip of a serpent's hood, as if assuming many forms to liberate the three worlds, be victorious! He is Śrī Pārśvanāth Prabhu. ||4||

Meaning: May he who, at one time, had his reflection cast on the tip of a serpent's hood, as if assuming many forms to liberate the three worlds, be victorious! He is Śrī Pārśvanāth Prabhu. ||4||

The Lord, the joy of the world, the son of Jñāta, is victorious! Even today, the wise ones live by his words, which are like nectar. ||5||

Meaning: Victory to Śrī Vardhamāna Svāmī, the son of Jñāta, who brings joy to the world! Even today, the wise ones live by his words, which are like nectar. ||5||

Having bowed to these and other Jinas, and also to the Guru, I now dare to reveal the essence of spirituality. ||6||

The Essence of Spirituality 

Page #5:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** I am enthusiastically embarking on the revelation of the essence of spirituality, after paying homage to these five Tirthankaras, as well as the other 22 Tirthankara Bhagavants like Ajitanatha, and the Gurudevs. || 6 ||

**Meaning:** I will expound upon a certain indescribable process related to spirituality, being well-versed in this subject through scriptures, the true tradition of wise men, and the experience of my own self. || 7 ||

**Meaning:** Just as musical songs sung by beautiful women are pleasing to those who indulge in worldly pleasures, similarly, beautiful verses filled with the essence of spirituality are pleasing to yogis. || 8 ||

**Meaning:** The pleasure that young men experience from tasting the nectar of a beloved's lips is like a mere drop compared to the ocean of bliss derived from savoring the essence of spiritual scriptures. || 9 ||

**Chapter One** 

Page #6:
---------------------------
Those who are blessed with the happiness of contentment born from the study of spiritual scriptures, do not consider the happiness of kings, Kubera, or Indra as anything. ||10||

**Meaning:** Yogis adorned with the happiness of contentment arising from the enjoyment of spiritual scriptures, do not consider the happiness of kings, Kubera, Indra, etc. as anything in comparison to their own happiness. ||10||

He who desires scholarship without studying spiritual scriptures is like a cripple who raises his finger to obtain the fruit of the Kalpavriksha. ||11||

**Meaning:** A person who desires scholarship and erudition without studying spiritual scriptures is like a cripple who raises his finger to obtain the fruit of the Kalpavriksha. ||11||

The spiritual scriptures are like a thunderbolt that shatters the mountain of pride, like the moon that increases the waves of the ocean of friendliness towards all beings, and like a wildfire that burns down the dense forest of delusion. ||12||

**Meaning:** Spiritual scriptures are like a thunderbolt that shatters the mountain of pride (hypocrisy), like the moon that increases the waves of the ocean of friendliness towards all beings, and like a wildfire that burns down the dense forest of delusion. ||12||

The path of Dharma is well-established, the thief of sin flees, and there is no rebellion in the kingdom of spiritual scriptures. ||13||

**Meaning:** The path of Dharma is well-established, the thief of sin flees, and there is no rebellion in the kingdom of spiritual scriptures. ||13||

**Essence of Spirituality** 

Page #7:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** When the kingdom of spirituality is attained, the path of religion becomes easy, the thief of sin flees, and there is no disturbance of any kind. || 13 ||

**Meaning:** Those whose hearts have digested the essence of the meaning of spiritual scriptures, never experience the torment of passions like anger, etc. Because they keep their mind and senses under their control. || 14 ||

**Meaning:** If there is no compassion (grace) of the warrior of the understanding of the meaning of spiritual scriptures, then the merciless, lustful, and wicked torment even the learned. That is, even the scholars of law, grammar, etc., are seen to engage in lustful activities like children, then what to speak of ordinary people? || 15 ||

**Meaning:** The supreme sages cut off the growing thirst, like a poisonous creeper, in the forest of the mind, with the sword of spiritual scriptures. || 16 ||

**Chapter One**
**7** 

Page #8:
---------------------------
In the forest, a dwelling; wealth in poverty; a lamp in darkness; water in the desert - these are all extremely difficult to obtain. Similarly, in this Kali Yuga, the attainment of Adhyatma Shastra is rare, it is found only by a fortunate few. ||17||

One who knows the Vedas and other scriptures experiences only distress, while one who knows Adhyatma Shastra enjoys the nectar of experience. Just as a donkey carries only the burden of sandalwood, a fortunate man uses it. ||18||

Those who know other scriptures, when they give lectures, gesticulate wildly with their arms and contort their faces in acting. But those who know Adhyatma Shastra, far from distorting their limbs, speak naturally without even blinking their eyes. ||19||

Adhyatma Sara 

Page #9:
---------------------------
From the ocean of Agamas churned by the Mount Meru of spiritual scriptures, do the wise not obtain many jewels of virtues? Certainly they do. ||20||

The taste of sensual pleasure lasts only till the enjoyment, the taste of delicious food lasts only till the meal, but the taste obtained by serving spiritual scriptures is limitless. ||21||

Books of fallacious arguments are like a fever of pride that infects the whole being. The vision becomes pure by the medicine of spiritual scriptures. ||22||

---------------------------
Dhaninampुtradarādi yathā saṁsāravṛddhyai | tathā pāṇḍityadṛptānāṁ śāstram adhyātmavarjitam ||23||
Bhāvartha: Just as for the wealthy, wife, children, and family, etc., are for the increase of worldly life, in the same way, for those who are proud of their scholarship, other scriptures devoid of spirituality are also the cause of worldly increase. ||23||
Adhyetavyam tadadhyātmaśāstram bhāvyam punaḥ punaḥ | anusṭheyastadarthaśca deyo yogyasya kasyacit ||24||
Bhāvartha: Therefore, the liberated soul should study the scriptures of spirituality, contemplate and meditate on them again and again, understand their ultimate meaning, practice the conduct described in them, and if any worthy seeker is found, explain the ultimate meaning to him. ||24||

## Chapter Two
## The Nature of Adhyatma

**O Lord! What is this Adhyatma, which you have described in such a way? Listen, dear one! As per the scriptures, I describe it before you.** ||1||

**Meaning:** When the disciple asks, "O Lord! What is this Adhyatma, whose greatness you have described?", the Guru replies, "Dear one! As per the scriptures, I describe Adhyatma before you, listen carefully." ||1||

**The pure action, which is performed by those whose power of delusion has been destroyed, taking the soul as the object, is called Adhyatma by the Jinas.** ||2||

**Meaning:** The Jinas have called the pure (blameless) action, which is performed by those whose power of delusion has been destroyed, taking the soul as the object, as Adhyatma. ||2||

**Just as Samayika is a companion in all types of conduct, similarly, Adhyatma is desired to be a companion in all Yogas.** ||3||

**Meaning:** Just as Samayika is a companion in all types of conduct, similarly, Adhyatma is desired to be a companion in all Yogas. ||3||

## Chapter Two
## 11 

Page #12:
---------------------------
The fourteenth *gunasthan*, starting from *apunarbhandhaka*, is considered to be *kriyadhyatmamayi* (spiritual in action), with progressively purer actions. ||4||

Actions performed by a *bhavaabhinandi* (one who desires worldly existence) due to attachment to food, *upadhi* (external possessions), worship, *ridhi* (wealth), and *gaurav* (prestige) are considered enemies of the spirit. ||5||

A being who is petty, greedy, humble, envious, fearful, deceitful, ignorant, and engages in pointless sinful actions is a *bhavaabhinandi*. ||6||

A being who is peaceful, self-controlled, always discreet, seeking liberation, benevolent to all, and performs actions without pride for the growth of spiritual qualities is considered to be *sadhyatma* (spiritually inclined). ||7|| 

Page #13:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** Peaceful, subdued, always with controlled senses, compassionate towards the world, seeking liberation, the seeker who performs all actions without ego, they are for the growth of spiritual qualities. ||7|| Therefore, the being with the intellect to ask questions, desirous of asking, eager to go to the holy ones, seeking Dharma, desiring to attain Dharma, the creator of the previously attained vision (the first category of qualities called Samyaktva), the devoted Shravaka (the second category of qualities), the Sadhu (the third category of qualities), and the three types of Anantaanshakshapka (the fourth category of qualities), the destroyer of the obscurations of vision (the fifth category of qualities), the pacifier of delusion (the sixth category of qualities), the peaceful delusion (the seventh category of qualities), the destroyer (the eighth category of qualities), the diminished delusion (the ninth category of qualities), the Jina (the tenth category of qualities), and the Ayogi Kevali (the eleventh category of qualities), thus, there is a gradual increase in spiritual qualities up to eleven categories of qualities. ||8-9-10||
**Chapter Two** 

Page #14:
---------------------------
As stated in order, these are the countless streams of virtues. Therefore, one should strive to cultivate them for the growth of spirituality, even with diligence. || 11 ||

**Meaning:** In this way, these 11 categories of virtues have been described, each with countless streams of virtues. Therefore, one should strive to practice them diligently for the growth of spirituality. || 11 ||

Pure knowledge and pure action, these two parts are intertwined in spirituality, like the two wheels of a great chariot or the two wings of a bird. || 12 ||

**Meaning:** Like the two wheels of a great chariot and the two wings of a bird, pure knowledge and pure action, these two parts are intertwined and connected in spirituality. || 12 ||

From the fifth stage of virtues onwards, this is considered to be the definitive view. However, from the perspective of practical application, it is also considered to be spirituality in the earlier stages. || 13 ||

**Meaning:** From the perspective of definitive knowledge, spirituality is considered to begin from the fifth stage of virtues. However, from the perspective of practical application, it is also considered to be spirituality in the earlier stages. || 13 ||

Even in the fourth stage of virtues, actions like service are appropriate. Just as silver ornaments are considered ornaments for those who do not have gold ornaments. || 14 ||

**Meaning:** Just as silver ornaments are considered ornaments for those who do not have gold ornaments, in the fourth stage of virtues, actions like service are considered appropriate. || 14 ||

**Essence of Spirituality** 

Page #15:
---------------------------
Just as in the fourth stage of spiritual progress, even if the highest actions are not present, there are still appropriate actions like serving the divine teacher, the desire to listen to Dharma, humility, detachment, and charity, which are characteristic of the fourth stage, called "Avirati-Samyagdristi." Therefore, even in the fourth stage, it is not objectionable to consider it as spiritual. Just as someone who does not have gold ornaments may still have silver ornaments, which are also considered ornaments, similarly, someone who has not attained the great renunciation may still have attained appropriate actions like service, which are also considered spiritual. ||14||

Even for those who have attained the state of "Apunarbhandhaka," the actions that are accompanied by calmness, though they may appear different due to different perspectives, are all for the destruction of obstacles to Dharma. ||15||

Meaning: According to various philosophies (or religious paths), the actions performed by those who have attained the state of "Apunarbhandhaka," which are accompanied by calmness and are diverse (varied), are all for the purpose of eliminating obstacles to the attainment of Dharma. ||15||

Even impure actions, if performed with good intentions (results), become the cause of pure actions. Just as copper, when melted and infused with the essence of mercury, etc., acquires the quality of gold (becomes gold). ||16||

Meaning: Even impure actions, if performed with good intentions (results), become the cause of pure actions. Just as copper, when melted and infused with the essence of mercury, etc., acquires the quality of gold (becomes gold). ||16||

---------------------------
Therefore, for the entry into the path, even for those with false views, the wise, endowed with patience, give the vows (conduct) by imputing the rightness of substance. ||17||

Meaning: For this reason, in order to initiate them into the path of Dharma, the wise, endowed with patience, give vows (conduct) even to those with false views by imputing the rightness of substance. ||17||

He who, understanding the non-virtuous nature of the world, is patient in observing the vows, is to be considered worthy. The distinction of inner feelings is difficult to perceive, therefore it should not be used here. ||18||

Meaning: He who, understanding the non-virtuous nature of the world, is patient in observing the vows, is to be considered worthy. The distinction of inner feelings is difficult to perceive, therefore it should not be used here. ||18||

If, due to not knowing the inner feelings, there is a destruction of both attainment and non-attainment, then by giving initiation, the path of the worthy ones will be cut off. ||19||

Meaning: If, due to not knowing the inner feelings, there is a destruction of both attainment and non-attainment, then by giving initiation, the path of the worthy ones will be cut off. ||19||

Even though one may have attained the right view, due to lack of respect for the impure, and due to lack of practice, one may not attain liberation. Because even that which is natural, becomes attainable only through practice. ||20||

16
Adhyatma Sara 

Page #17:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Verse 20:**

**Meaning:** Without disregarding the impure (false vision) and without attaining the practice of pure yoga, only natural rightness will be realized, other visions etc. will not be realized. Because these visions etc. are also achieved through practice. ||20||

**Verse 21:**

**Meaning:** Due to the love for the pure path of liberation as spoken by the omniscient, the pureness that exists in the virtuous, obedient to the wise, learned, and authoritative guru, who are free from deceit, hypocrisy, etc., and who follow the path of righteousness, does not get destroyed in any vision (philosophy). Then what to say about the purity of the righteous people who are inclined towards the Jain philosophy? ||21||

**Verse 22:**

**Meaning:** The karma (action) is of three types, based on the object, the self, and the attachment, and they are pure in ascending order. The first of these three is called object-karma - falling from a mountain etc. for liberation. ||22||

**Chapter 2: Second Authority**

**17** 

Page #18:
---------------------------
Ignorant people's second karma is Yama, Niyama, etc., from the worldly perspective. The third karma is the one that follows the knowledge of the respective principles with a peaceful mind. That is, the anubandha karma is only for the knowers. ||23||

The first karma, due to the abundance of ignorance, is not capable of stopping the obstacles to liberation, such as attachment, etc. And many Acharyas have said that even a slight amount of dispassion, etc., with a good intention, leads to a birth that is in accordance with that result. ||24||

The second karma leads to the destruction of some defects, like the powder of a frog. The third karma, however, leads to the complete destruction of defects, by considering the heavy and light. ||25||

Action is inherently pure, therefore it is a purifier. With the conduct of the Muni-Indra, the seed of the path is firmly established with reverence. ||26|| 

Page #19:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** The pure action of the living being, which arises from the conduct of the Jinesvara, is purifying. Therefore, by showing utmost respect to action, the living being attains the path-seed (samyaktva). ||26||

**Meaning:** By remaining under the command of the Guru, even after receiving the Dravya Diksha, many noble living beings have attained the supreme (moksha) position through the process of Viryollaas (increase in power). ||27||

**Meaning:** Even during the time of attaining spirituality, there are some actions and some knowledge that follows the good crowd (general) cognition. ||28||

**Meaning:** Therefore, spirituality exists in both the forms of knowledge and action. That spirituality increases in those seekers who are adorned with unpretentious conduct. O disciple! The spirituality you inquired about earlier, that spirituality is different... 

Page #20:
---------------------------
Knowledge and action are both pervasive, except for the objects. And it increases progressively in the life of great souls who are endowed with spiritual nature, that is, sincere conduct = religious behavior. ||29||
|| Thus ends the chapter on the nature of the soul ||2||

... Right number three.
[Pride-Renunciation] Pride is like fire to burn the vine of liberation, pride is Rahu to the moon of action, pride is the cause of misfortune, pride is like an obstacle to the attainment of spiritual happiness. ||1||
Meaning: Pride is like fire to burn the vine of liberation, pride is Rahu to the moon of action, pride is the cause of misfortune, pride is like an obstacle to the attainment of spiritual happiness. ||1|| Pride is like a thunderbolt to break the mountain of knowledge, pride is like ghee to fuel the fire of desire, pride is a friend to vices, pride is a thief who steals the wealth of vows. ||2||
Meaning: Pride is like a thunderbolt to break the mountain of knowledge, pride is like ghee to fuel the fire of desire, pride is a friend to vices, pride is a thief who steals the wealth of vows. ||2|| One who takes vows with pride and desires the highest state, is like one who boards a ship of iron and desires to cross the ocean. ||3||
Meaning: One who takes vows with pride and desires the highest state, is like one who boards a ship of iron and desires to cross the ocean. ||3|| Right number three 

Page #22:
---------------------------
Just as one who tries to cross the ocean in an iron boat, the person who boards the iron boat sinks in the ocean, similarly the arrogant one sinks in the ocean of the world. ||3|| What is the use of vows or austerities if arrogance is not eradicated? What is the use of a mirror or a lamp for a blind person? Just as these two are useless for the blind, so are vows, austerities, etc., useless for the arrogant, they are meaningless. ||4||
The practice of keeping hair and eyes closed, sleeping on the ground, begging for alms, observing the vow of celibacy, etc., are all tainted by arrogance, just as a precious gem is tainted by a small blemish. ||5|| 

Page #23:
---------------------------
I
All the aforementioned religions, which are means, become contaminated. All his aforementioned actions become useless and fruitless. ||5||
It is easy to give up the craving for delicious food, it is also easy to give up the adornment of the body. It is also easy to give up sensual pleasures; but it is very difficult to give up pride. ||6||
Meaning: People who hide their faults think that by doing so, they will be worshipped and respected by people, their glory will increase, but in reality, these fools get ridicule (shame) only from pride. ||7||
Just as the character of a prostitute is for the increase of immorality, so also the observance of vows (initiation) by those who wear the garb of a saint is for the increase of non-observance (sin) due to pride. ||8||

Therefore, one who is unable to bear the fire of the root-virtues, it is proper for him to accept the Shravaka-vratas, but it is not proper to live with pride. ||12||
Meaning: Therefore, one who is unable to bear the fire of the root-virtues, it is proper for him to accept the Shravaka-vratas, but it is not proper to live with pride. ||12||
One who is unable to renounce even the Linga due to strong attachment, should become a Sanvijna-pakshiya, a humble servant of the virtuous. ||13||
Meaning: One who is unable to renounce even the Linga due to strong attachment, should become a Sanvijna-pakshiya, a humble servant of the virtuous. ||13||
Even a humble and dejected one, who speaks the pure meaning, his slight effort, given to a virtuous one, is like a drop of water in a desert. ||14||
Meaning: Even a humble and dejected one, who speaks the pure meaning, his slight effort, given to a virtuous one, is like a drop of water in a desert. ||14||
Those who clearly know their own inability to bear the burden of the Mahavratas, and yet pretend to be superior, their name is also a sin. ||15||
Meaning: Those who clearly know their own inability to bear the burden of the Mahavratas, and yet pretend to be superior, their name is also a sin. ||15|| 

Page #26:

Page #27:
---------------------------
Therefore, the seeker of self-realization should abandon pride, which is the cause of misery, because the Agamas state that "simplicity leads to the purification of the soul."  Simplicity is the foundation of Dharma and the path to liberation. ||19||

The Jinas have not prescribed any absolute rules or prohibitions for any action. Their command is: "Whatever action you perform, do it with simplicity and without pride." Therefore, the first and foremost duty is to abandon pride. ||20||

For those whose minds are devoted to spirituality, even a little pride is not appropriate, because even a small hole in a ship can cause it to sink in the ocean. ||21||

Chapter Three
27 

Page #28:
---------------------------
Even the pride of Malli Nath, etc., is the cause of the evil of the female scriptures. Therefore, the great soul should strive to avoid it. ||22||

Meaning: Just as old age, pride also became the cause of the evil of the female scriptures for Malli Nath, etc. Therefore, the great soul should strive to abandon it. ||22||

|| Thus ends the chapter on the abandonment of pride. ||3||

## Chapter Four
[Contemplation of the Nature of Existence]

Therefore, a wise man, skilled in the practice of non-hypocrisy, should contemplate the nature of existence, fixing his mind for even a moment. This contemplation is like the waves of a vast spiritual lake, nourished by the pleasant wind of the foundation of detachment, and brings happiness to the virtuous. ||1||

**Meaning:** Therefore, a man skilled in the practice of non-hypocrisy and wise, should contemplate the nature of existence, fixing his mind for even a moment. This contemplation of the nature of existence is like the waves of a vast spiritual lake, nourished by the pleasant wind of the foundation of detachment, and brings happiness to the virtuous. ||1||

On one side, the unbearable fire of desire burns fiercely, while on the other, the mountains of objects crumble, falling from their peaks. On one side, the whirlpool of anger, created by the confluence of the currents of delusion, churns. In this ocean of existence, who can be fearless? ||2||

**Meaning:** On one side, the unbearable fire of desire burns fiercely, while on the other, the mountains of objects crumble, falling from their peaks. On one side, the whirlpool of anger, created by the confluence of the currents of delusion, churns. In this ocean of existence, who can be fearless? ||2|| 

Page #30:
---------------------------
A rain of broken stones is falling, on one side a wrathful vortex (whirlpool) is seen arising from the confluence of deformed rivers; in such a world-ocean, who does not experience fear? Fear is seen everywhere. ||2||
Where the beloved flame flares up with the burning heat of desire. Her glances are like smoke-clouds, dark as the petals of the blue lotus. And her limbs are like boundless coals, transformed by many desires. In this fire of existence, where is peace to be found? ||3||
Meaning: In this fire of the world, the beloved flame, made restless by the burning heat of desire (lust). She throws out smoke-clouds, dark as the petals of the lotus, in the form of her glances. Her limbs are like coals, from which flames of worldly desires arise. In such a blazing fire of the world, where is happiness to be found? ||3||
Having given the noose of affection for son and wife, where the weak creatures of nature are oppressed.  Completely sorrowful, with the cruel warriors of diverse desires, existence is a desolate place, oh, how terrifying it is! ||4||
Meaning: Alas! This world is a terrifying slaughterhouse, where the cruel warriors of diverse desires (lust) oppress the weak creatures of nature. Completely sorrowful, with the cruel warriors of diverse desires, existence is a desolate place, oh, how terrifying it is! ||4|| 

Page #31:
---------------------------
They are constantly tormenting the animal-like beings by putting a snare of affection for their children, wives, etc., around their necks. And because of this, the animal-like beings, who are suffering from extreme pain, are screaming. ||4||

In the night of ignorance, he wanders, carrying a heavy load of passions on his head. He throws the bones of objects around his neck. He shows his teeth of great vices, with a crooked, deceitful face. This one is not trustworthy, for he is a night-walker. ||5||

Meaning: This world is like a demon, who walks in the night of ignorance, carries a heavy load of passions on his head, has a pile of bones of objects hanging around his neck, and then, with a crooked, deceitful face, shows his teeth of great vices. Therefore, one should not trust such a demon-like world. ||5||

Having obtained a small alms of the wealth of Dharma, the noble beings who wander in the forest of existence, are robbed by the strong arrows of flowers in the difficult fortresses of the breasts of women. In the forest of existence, it is not appropriate for the helpless to go there. ||6||

Meaning: Having obtained a small alms of the wealth of Dharma with great difficulty, the noble beings who wander in the forest of existence, are robbed by the strong arrows of flowers in the difficult fortresses of the breasts of women. In the forest of existence, it is not appropriate for the helpless to go there. ||6|| 

Page #32:
---------------------------
Kamadeva, the formidable robber, plunders. Therefore, it is not at all proper to enter this terrifying forest of the world without a guide. || 6 ||

"This wealth is mine, that house is mine, these wife, children, etc., are mine"; thus, due to the perverse understanding of "mineness", even after repeatedly experiencing immense suffering, people in the world are filled with pride in false happiness. Therefore, this world is made of falsehood. A wise person does not become attached to this deceitful world. || 7 ||

Affection for a beloved is like a shackle, the family, like a guard, wealth, like a new bond. This world, a prison, is filled with the impure substance of pride, and is fraught with the contact of vices like pits (burrows). Wise people have no desire for this. || 8 || 

Page #33:
---------------------------
The reason is terrible. In truth, this world is a prison. Therefore, wise men never have attachment (āsakti) to it. ||8||

Great anger is like a terrible vulture, the restless jackal is like avarice, and the owl, like Cupid, wanders freely, making a harsh sound. ||9||

The fire of sorrow burns there, and the heap of ashes of disgrace is spread all around. Therefore, where is the beauty in this world, which is like a cremation ground? Nowhere at all. ||9||

The shadow of wealth is like the shadow of a poisonous tree, which increases the intoxication of the senses. The lust of women is like the pollen of that poisonous tree, which causes great harm. ||10||

The taste of the fruits of this world is like the poison of hell, which causes a multitude of diseases. Therefore, the wise should not be attached to this world, which is full of poison. ||10||

Chapter Four
33 

Page #34:
---------------------------
The taste of its fruits is like the vast group of diseases and suffering of hell! It is not right for wise men to have faith in such a world-poisoning tree. ||10||

Sometimes a kingdom, sometimes even a little wealth is difficult to obtain. Sometimes high caste, sometimes low birth and bad reputation. Sometimes beauty and excessive splendor, sometimes not even the form of the body. This disparity is pleasing to whom? To no one. ||11||

This desire, which digs a path, is a weariness for the great ones, a quarrel with the side effects. Like the snakes that crawl in their holes, the ignorant think this world is a place of happiness. What do we say? How can there be happiness in this world of constant change? ||12||

Tell me, for in this house of the world, the lustful enemy, Kamadeva, has entered like a thief, digging up the earth of virtue (Triratna), constantly quarreling with the neighboring bad consequences, and within (the mind) are the burrows of the mobile snake, adorned with eight fangs (Ashtamada). How can there be happiness in such a house of the world? ||12||

The thirsty beings, enslaved by the objects of sense, are distressed in this summer of the world. The lake of virtue has dried up due to the fierce sun of wrath. Remember how the fat of virtue melts daily due to the sweat of lust. In this terrible summer of existence, what refuge is there to alleviate the heat? ||13||

Meaning: In this summer of the world, where the fierce sun of intense anger has dried up the lake of virtue, the thirsty beings, enslaved by the objects of sense, are distressed by thirst. In this summer of the world, where the fat of virtue melts daily due to the sweat of lust, what refuge is there to alleviate the heat? ||13||

Father, mother, brother, even those who are desired and approved, are not the givers of wealth, nor are they knowledgeable about the village of virtue. People are self-interested, deceitful, and harboring evil intentions. Who is the connoisseur of the taste of happiness in this existence? ||14||

Chapter Four 

Page #36:
---------------------------
**भावार्थ:** In this world, mother, father, brother, etc., are favorable and agreeable only when their desired object is obtained. Even a wealthy person, knowing their good qualities and deeds, does not give wealth. Because in this world, everyone is constantly engrossed in the growth of their own self-interest. Therefore, who among the connoisseurs of worldly happiness (**pramata**) is interested in calling this happiness? ||14||

**भावार्थ:** Alas! When their great self-interest is fulfilled, people embrace those (**nirdhan** or lowly or relatives) individuals with praise, prestige, or wealth, giving their lives for them. When self-interest is not fulfilled, they ruthlessly abandon them like straw. Thus, worldly people harbor poison in their hearts and nectar in their mouths, betraying trust. If you are not distressed (**vairagya**) by such a world, then what is the benefit of saying more? Nothing at all. ||15||

**भावार्थ:** With beautiful appearances, they create joy, but when these appearances are marred, even the wealthy and virtuous become distressed. ||36||

**Adhyatma Sara** 

Page #37:
---------------------------
By means of praise and other upaya, how can one even slightly remove the delusion? Alas, such is the uneven creation of the karma of delusion in the house of existence. ||16||

**Meaning:** Even a virtuous man is delighted to see the beautiful corners of the eyes of the wealthy who possess abundant wealth, and he is saddened to see their angry gaze. Then, with great difficulty, he pacifies them with praise and other upaya, and removes their anger. Alas! Such is the uneven creation of the karma of delusion in the house of existence. ||16||

**Priya Preksha is the beloved, Vinaya is the son, Gunarati is the daughter, Viveka is the father, and the pure and spotless Parinati is the mother.** This is the clear and distinct family of the pure soul. The being has not seen this family while wandering in the endless cycle of existence; yet, he has the desire for the happiness of association in the external family of wife and children. This is indeed a wonder. ||17||

**Chapter Four**
**37** 

Page #38:
---------------------------
In this world, there is no happiness anywhere. In this world, even the beginning of love is painful, then maintaining that love unbroken is difficult; and when love (the beloved) is lost (separation), there are many sorrows. These are endured by the hard-hearted person like a pot placed in a potter's kiln, heated on all sides, and finally, due to the consequences of evil deeds, he suffers the pain of hell and other miseries in future lives. Therefore, there is no happiness whatsoever in this world, which is like a kiln.

This battlefield of existence, the army of Dharma has been destroyed by the arrows of the glances of beautiful women. Here, the hearts of hundreds of righteous warriors are stained with the thick blood of attachment. Hundreds of vices, like vultures, are circling above, and this is indeed the land of great delusion, the battlefield of love. 

Page #39:
---------------------------
Cruel vultures are circling above (on the head or in the sky). For this reason, truly this world is the battlefield of the great king. ||19|| They laugh, they play, and then they become sad in many ways, they cry, they scream, and for a moment they engage in disputes. ||20|| They flee, they rejoice, they dance helplessly, they are possessed by the madness of delusion. ||20|| 
Meaning: In this world, beings who are mad with the unprecedented madness of delusion, helplessly laugh one moment, start playing another moment, become sad another moment, start crying another moment, shout loudly another moment, lament, then start arguing the next moment, start running around in a moment, dance with joy another moment; in the world, all these wonderful actions are performed by beings who are mad with delusion. ||20|| Incomplete knowledge is like a false friendship, a deceitful system of conduct, or the youth of a widowed woman. ||21|| Like a deer's gaze on a husband who is not worthy, the wave of affection. ||21|| The play of existence burns the hearts of those who see the truth. ||21||
_ Meaning: The games related to the world burn the hearts of the true-seeing men in the same way as incomplete knowledge burns the hearts of those who are not worthy. ||21|| 
Fourth Authority 

Page #40:
---------------------------
To the reader, direct known friendship with the wicked, the tradition of injustice in the assembly, the youth of a widowed woman, the wave of affection of a doe-eyed woman towards an unskilled husband, all these go to the heart of that person. ||21||
When dawn breaks, the dream-like creation becomes false, or in the absence of darkness, the clear-sighted being sees two moons, a delusion. Similarly, for the virtuous, with their unwavering, calm, and steady minds, who have attained knowledge of the truth, this world appears as an illusion. ||22||
Meaning: Just as the creation seen in a dream becomes futile when dawn breaks, or a clear-sighted being with the disease of night blindness (timir) gone sees two moons, a delusion, similarly, for the virtuous, with their unwavering, calm, and steady minds, who have attained knowledge of the truth, this world appears as an illusion. ||22||
Previously, our mind (belief) was that this world was made of nectar, with the beloved's sweet words, the sound of the veena, the comfort of sleep and the body. Now, having contemplated the truth of the Upanishads, our interest lies in this world, but also in our own Self. ||23|| 

Page #41:
---------------------------
And it is made of all kinds of nectar-like pleasures, such as body-massage (pressing), etc., but now, due to the sudden attainment of the Upanishad (secret) of the soul-principle, we do not feel any attachment to this world at all, only interest in the soul-principle. ||23||
Those who hold the extreme hardness of the world's illusory fabric, born of ignorance, like a doll made of wood or stone, are extremely delighted like a pot of milk in the form of breasts. ||24||
**Meaning:** Now, the illusory fabric of this world, born of ignorance, does not seem very pleasurable or attractive, like a doll made of wood or stone, or like a pot of milk in the form of breasts, because the ignorance-cloud has dissipated, and the moon of self-knowledge has risen, resulting in the natural attainment of the nectar of bliss. Therefore, it is good to completely renounce the world's illusions. ||24||
Whether it is worldly possessions or royal glory, or the collection of elephants, horses, and cows, it is not born of knowledge, meditation, and peace. What is it to your mind? ||25||
External pleasures, what are they to your mind? They are not the pleasures of the soul. Therefore, who would abandon the happiness that is within their control and desire external happiness? ||25||
||24||
Chapter Four
41 

Page #42:
---------------------------
**भावarth:** In the world, there is external wealth (Rajalakshmi) accumulated from elephants, horses, cows, bulls, etc. So, is there not an internal wealth (Antarang Lakshmi) arising from knowledge, meditation, and tranquility in the minds of yogis? Certainly, there is. And just as there are external women in this world, similarly, is there not a feminine form of Atmarati (love for the soul) residing in the minds of yogis? It is indeed there. Therefore, which wise person would abandon this independent happiness and desire dependent happiness? ||25||

**भावarth:** All the happiness in the world is dependent, perishable, momentary, tainted by desires, and fearful. Yet, a person with a foolish mind finds joy in it. But the wise, on the other hand, are immersed in independent, imperishable, free from the desire of senses, and fearless spiritual happiness. ||26||

**Tadetad bhaṣante jagadabhayadanam khalu bhavasvarupanudhyanam samasukhnidānam kṛtadhiyaḥ:** This is what the wise say: contemplation of the true nature of existence is the source of fearlessness in the world, and the foundation of peace and happiness. ||42||

**Adhyatmasara** 

Page #43:
---------------------------
In whom the rays of knowledge are steady like camphor, there the glory and prosperity of those who know the truth of the Jina's teachings will be great. ||27||

Meaning: Therefore, wise people say that contemplation (meditation) on the nature of the world (shyama) is the cause of equanimity and happiness, and it gives fearlessness to the world; and by becoming steady in that meditation, the glory and prosperity of those who know the Jina's teachings will shine brightly in the world like the rays of the moon and camphor. ||27||

|| Thus ends the first chapter of the Adhyatma-Sara-Prakarana, composed by Shri Yashovijaya, the disciple of Shri Nayavijaya-Gani. ||4||

## Right Number Five
[Vairagya-Sam-bhav] From the knowledge of the true nature of existence, and from the vision of non-quality (nirguna), arises aversion. From this aversion, the cutting off of desire, which is the form of dispassion, arises. ||1||

**Meaning:** From the special knowledge of the nature of the world, and from seeing it with the vision of non-quality (emptiness), aversion arises. This aversion, in the form of the cutting off of desire for that world (in the form of birth and death), produces dispassion in the soul. When one has special knowledge of the nature of the world, and sees no quality (essence) in worldly beings, even in the slightest, then dispassion arises quickly. Just as a body that is swollen appears full (nourished), but is actually hollow, so too the world is full of empty pomp, it is devoid of essence, full of suffering, and terrifying. Thus, from aversion to the world, dispassion, in the form of renunciation (cutting off from the world), arises quickly. ||1||

Those who describe dispassion as arising from the attainment of worldly happiness, their opinion is not valid, as long as the true nature of things is not known. ||2||

**Meaning:** Those who describe dispassion as arising from the attainment of worldly happiness, their opinion is not valid, as long as the true nature of things is not known. ||2|| 

Page #45:
---------------------------
The statement that "worldly pleasures are happiness" is not proven, therefore it is not appropriate. ||2||
Due to the delusion of non-attainment, even after attaining infinite worldly pleasures, the desire of the deluded beings does not subside. ||3||
Meaning: Even after attaining infinite worldly pleasures, the deluded beings do not feel satisfied due to the delusion of non-attainment. ||3||
Just as fire does not subside with fuel, but rather burns more intensely, similarly, the desire for worldly pleasures does not subside with their consumption, but rather increases with the increase in power. ||4||
Meaning: Just as fire does not subside with fuel, but rather burns more intensely, similarly, the desire for worldly pleasures does not subside with their consumption, but rather increases with the increase in power. ||4||
Just as lions cannot be gentle and snakes cannot be forgiving, because their nature is cruel, similarly, it is extremely difficult for beings who are attached to worldly pleasures to attain detachment. ||5||
Meaning: Just as lions cannot be gentle and snakes cannot be forgiving, because their nature is cruel, similarly, it is extremely difficult for beings who are attached to worldly pleasures to attain detachment. ||5||
One who desires detachment without renouncing worldly pleasures is like one who desires to cure a disease without abandoning the harmful food. ||6||
Chapter Five
45 

Page #46:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** Even if a sick person takes the best medicine, but continues to consume unhealthy food, the medicine will not be beneficial. Similarly, if a being performs austerities, chanting, etc., but does not renounce worldly desires, they will not benefit from these actions. They cannot be liberated from the cycle of birth and death through such actions. ||6||

**Meaning:** Just as a drop of water cannot stay on a heated iron mass, similarly, detachment cannot stay in the mind of a being attached to worldly desires. ||7||

**Meaning:** If the moon were to rise on the night of the new moon, or if a barren tree were to bear fruit, then detachment could enter the heart of a being attached to worldly desires. Just as these two things are impossible in all three periods of time, similarly, detachment is never possible in a mind attached to worldly desires. ||8||

**Meaning:** Detachment arises without any hindrance from the sight of the virtues of the Self, when there is aversion to the causes of existence and non-involvement in worldly objects. ||9|| 

Page #47:
---------------------------
**Verse 9**

**Meaning:** Therefore, aversion (disgust) towards the causes of worldly increase leads to non-attachment to objects; and only when objects are seen as devoid of qualities (meaningless) does dispassion become unobstructed.

**Verse 10**

**Meaning:** Here, the disciple raises a doubt: Even in the fourth stage of spiritual progress (Avirati Samyagdristi), where individuals are attached to worldly pleasures, those who know the truth, through evidence and certainty, understand the world's lack of qualities and its meaninglessness. Can they experience dispassion? And is that dispassion justified?

**Verse 11**

**Meaning:** The above statement is true, but the power of the karma that obscures right conduct (Charitramohaniya karma) is such that even in the fourth stage of spiritual progress, when other factors are present, the desired result is not achieved; the absence of the result is evident.

**Verse 12**

**Meaning:** It is not that in the fourth stage of spiritual progress, in the state of right conduct (Samyaktva), dispassion is completely absent. However, there is no attachment to one's own actions, and this is also stated in the scriptures. 

Page #48:
---------------------------
Due to the activity of immersion in the spiritual nature, even though there is a tendency towards objects, attachment diminishes. In the Shri Vitrag-Stotra, Kalikāl Sarvajña Shri Hemchandrasuriśvaraji Maharaj has said the same. We quote that verse here:  ||12||  Yada marunnaraindrashrīstvaaya naathopabhujyate | Yatra tatra ratirnaama viraktatvam tadapi te ||13||
Meaning: O Lord, the Supreme God! When you enjoy the wealth of Indra or a king, even then your delight is seen everywhere, but in reality, you were in a state of detachment. ||13||  Bhavesha yasya vichchhinna pravrittih karmabhaavajaa | Ratistasyaviraktasyasarvatra shubhavedyatah ||14||
Meaning: The one whose desire for existence (birth and death) has been destroyed, whose activity in the enjoyment of objects etc. arises from the emergence of exhausted karma, the delight (rati) that is seen in that detached one, also arises from the emergence of auspicious karma everywhere. This does not destroy their feeling of detachment. ||14||  Atachchaakshepakjnaanaat kantaayaam bhogsannidhau | Na shuddhi-prakshayoyasmadharibhadraamidam vachah ||15|| 48
Adhyatmasar 

Page #49:
---------------------------
**Verse 15:**

**Meaning:** Therefore, even though a woman and the material objects of enjoyment are near, their purity does not diminish due to the knowledge of the **Akshapak** (non-virtuous). This is the statement of Shri Haribhadrasuri.

**Verse 16:**

**Meaning:** He sees the entire world as a mirage, with a **Tattvik** (true) vision. Therefore, he is not troubled by sensual pleasures, nor is he consumed by passion. He does not become absorbed in them. Such a great soul attains liberation without any obstacles.

**Verse 17:**

**Meaning:** Knowing the nature of sensual pleasures as an illusion, even while enjoying them, one who is not attached to them attains the supreme state of liberation.

**Verse 18:**

**Meaning:** However, the soul who identifies with the world and its pleasures cannot cross the ocean of existence. This is truly a mirage. Just like a mirage... 

Page #50:
---------------------------
He goes to take the water, seeing the reflection of water; but his hand finds nothing, just like the objects of enjoyment. Understanding this, who in this human world can reach the desired place from this vile path? ||18||
He remains there, undoubtedly, full of worldly anxieties. Even on the path of liberation, he is deluded by the entanglement of enjoyment. ||19||
Meaning: A soul with the vision of the ultimate truth remains anxious about the world even while being a householder; while the enjoyer remains entangled in the algae (moss) of enjoyment even on the path of liberation. ||19||
The power of enjoyment does not destroy the power of Dharma, which is stronger. Just as the wind that extinguishes a lamp cannot extinguish a blazing fire, so too the power of enjoyment cannot destroy the very strong power of Dharma. ||20||
Meaning: Just as the wind that extinguishes a lamp cannot extinguish a blazing fire, so too the power of enjoyment cannot destroy the very strong power of Dharma. ||20||
Just as a fly gets stuck in phlegm (mucus), so too a soul gets stuck in the thick attachment to objects; but just as a fly does not get stuck in a dry clay ball, so too a detached soul, free from attachment, does not get stuck in objects. ||21||
Meaning: Just as a fly gets stuck in phlegm (mucus), so too a soul gets stuck in the thick attachment to objects; but just as a fly does not get stuck in a dry clay ball, so too a detached soul, free from attachment, does not get stuck in objects. ||21||

**Verse 22:**

* **Text:**  *bahudoṣanirōdhārtham anivṛttirapī kvacit | nivṛttiriv no duṣṭā yogānuabhavasālinām ||22||*
* **Meaning:** For those who are experienced in Yoga, even non-renunciation, at times, is not a fault, as it can help to eliminate many faults.

**Verse 23:**

* **Text:** *yasminniṣevyamāṇe'pi yasyāśuddhiḥ kadācan | tenaiva tasya śuddhiḥ syāt kadāciditi hi śrutiḥ || 23 ||*
* **Meaning:** The scriptures say that the very objects which cause impurity at times, can also lead to purification.

**Verse 24:**

* **Text:** *viṣayāṇām tato bandhajanane niyamo'sti na | ajñānīnām tato bandho jñānīnām tu na karhicit || 24 ||*

**Verse 25:**

* **Text:** *sevatae'sevamanō'pi sevamanō na sevatae | kō'pi pārajanō na syācchrayan parajanānāpi || 25 ||*

He does not do it. Just as a being does not become a parjan even when taking shelter of a parjan, he is called a swajan, in the same way, a jnani is not karmamay. ||25|| Therefore, due to the merit of great punya-vipak, the moksha-lakshmi has come close to them. The vairagya of those excellent men is not destroyed from the womb. ||26|| For those who are calm towards objects, and whose senses are constantly turned away from objects, this beautiful vairagya is the royal path. ||27|| For those who are self-restrained, without any stimulation and control, and whose senses are satisfied, the vairagya that they have is considered to be a single path. ||28|| The senses, being driven by force, become like a forest. They never come under control, but rather increase in their purpose. ||29|| 

Page #53:
---------------------------
**Verse 29:**

**Meaning:**  Forcing the senses (suppressing them) does not bring them under control, like a wild elephant, but instead makes them prone to causing harm.

**Verse 30:**

**Meaning:** Those who appear to be righteous but look down upon others with shame, while harboring evil thoughts in their minds, are deceitful and cast their souls into the pit of hell.

**Verse 31:**

**Meaning:** A man who is detached from the objects of the senses, by dedicating his soul to pure devotion and constantly recognizing the distinction between self and others, can successfully prevent his senses from being captivated by those objects.

**Verse 32:**

**Meaning:** The extraordinary detachment is one where there is no intention or effort, whether in attachment or detachment, and the sensory afflictions gradually diminish.

**Verse 33:**

**Meaning:** The activities of yogis, like the dance of a puppet controlled by strings, do not cause any harm. Knowledgeable people who live in the world are like this.

**Chapter 5** 

Page #54:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** In worldly conduct, the tendencies of the wise are like the dance of a puppet in a wooden instrument. Yet, for that yogi, worldly tendencies are not painful. ||33|| This is called "Yoga Maya" by other philosophers. It is not a fault because it is the cause of benefit to the world. ||34|| It is also heard in the scriptures that even in the path of exception, it is consistent with the result of the destruction of the assembly of ignorant men like deer. ||35|| When knowledge matures, its fruit is indifference. At that time, even in the fourth stage of the qualities, detachment remains. ||36||
|| Thus ends the chapter on the origin of detachment. ||

## Chapter Six
[ **Vairagya-Bhed** ] That **Vairagya** is remembered as threefold, due to its connection with **Dukha**, **Moha**, and **Jnana**. The first, **Dukha-garbha** **Vairagya**, is characterized by anxiety (aversion) towards the world, arising from the non-attainment of desired objects. || 1 ||

**Meaning:** That **Vairagya** is of three types: (1) **Dukha-garbha** (2) **Moha-garbha** and (3) **Jnana-garbha**. Of these, the first, **Dukha-garbha** **Vairagya**, is that which arises from anxiety (aversion) towards the world, due to the non-attainment of desired objects. || 1 ||

Here, the sorrow of the body and mind is not conducive to **Jnana**. Even if one attains their desired object, their **Vairagya** is destroyed. || 2 ||

Those who are averse to **Dukha**, desire the path of return (to the householder life) beforehand. Like the impatient in battle, they enter the forest, etc. || 3 ||

**Meaning:** Those who, due to fear of **Dukha**, adopt the life of a renunciant, desire to return to the householder life beforehand. Like the impatient in battle, they enter the forest, etc. || 3 || 

Page #56:

He takes, just as an impatient coward desires (intends) to enter (hide) in the forest, etc., before going to war. ||3||
Dry logic, etc., and some medicine, etc., indeed. They read these, but not the principle-method. ||4||
Meaning: Oh! Thus, a man endowed with dispassion studies the scriptures of dry logic and medicine, etc., but does not read the principle-method, which is like the river of calmness (equality). ||4||
By understanding the leaves of the scriptures, they carry the heat of pride. They do not reach the end of truth, the nectar-like stream of calmness. ||5||
Meaning: The seeker, detached from suffering, gains superficial understanding from the scriptures, and increases the heat of pride, but does not know or cannot attain the truth (spiritual secret), which is like the nectar-like stream of peace. ||5||
These, who merely wear the garb, are not superior to householders. For they are neither early risers nor late sleepers. ||6||

At home, there is barely enough food, but after taking *diksha*, one gets *moudakas* (sweet balls) to eat every day. Then what is the suffering in *diksha*? This kind of *vairagya* (renunciation) is a sign of *duhkha-garbha* (suffering-filled) *vairagya*. ||7||

**Meaning:** The one who takes *diksha* with such *vairagya* (renunciation) is a sign of *duhkha-garbha* (suffering-filled) *vairagya*. ||7||

*Vairagya* (renunciation) born from the study of *kushastra* (scripture) and seeing the *nirguna* (non-attribute) nature of the world is *moha-garbha* (delusion-filled) *vairagya*. This kind of *vairagya* is found in *balatapasvi* (young ascetics). ||8||

Even those who take refuge in the principles of the *Jineshwara* (Jain Tirthankara) and speak against the principles with their intellectual imagination, even if they perform very difficult austerities or harsh actions, their *vairagya* (renunciation) is still *moha-garbha* (delusion-filled). ||9||

**Bhavarth:** Because their auspicious outcome is not truly liberating like that of those who hold the view of liberation from the cycle of birth and death; nor is their interest in the commands of the liberated ones stable. ||10||

**Bhavarth:** The one who has moha-filled vairagya experiences a state of calmness, but it is only for the nourishment of their faults, because their inner being is filled with falsehood. Just as a hidden fever consumes the body's elements, so too does the calmness of a sadhaka whose inner being is filled with falsehood nourish their faults. ||11||

**Bhavarth:** Skill in worldly matters, but confusion in spiritual matters; self-indulgence, faulty reasoning, and praising the unworthy; self-exaltation, harming others, quarrelsomeness, and living a life of pride; covering up one's attachments, acting without restraint, and being indifferent to actions; attachment to qualities, forgetting kindness, lack of concern for the consequences, and forgetting one's dedication; faith, softness, arrogance, impatience, and lack of discernment. This is the list of characteristics of the second type of vairagya. ||12-15|| 

Page #59:

## Meaning:

**Verse 12:** Skill in interpreting scriptures, contradicting the meaning of scriptures, acting on whims, fondness for fallacious arguments, and abandoning the company of virtuous people.

**Verse 13:** Boasting about one's own excellence, harboring treachery towards others, engaging in quarrels, living a life of pride, concealing sins, and respecting actions that exceed one's capacity.

**Verse 14:** Lack of attachment to virtues, forgetting about helping others, not considering the karmic consequences of actions (whether they lead to merit or demerit), and not focusing the mind (pranidhana) on religious practices like detachment (vairagya).

**Verse 15:** This is the list of characteristics of the second type of detachment, which is rooted in delusion: laxity in faith, arrogance, impatience, and lack of wisdom.

**Verse 16:** Detachment for a soul who is knowledgeable about the principles of right conduct (samyak-tattva), who determines the truth through the doctrine of Syadvada (Anekantavada), who touches upon the means of liberation (moksha), and who has a vision of the truth, is imbued with knowledge.

**Verse 17:** The detachment of a seeker whose contemplation (mimamsa) is vast, whose intellect is beyond the reach of self-interest, is imbued with knowledge. 

Page #60:
---------------------------
The soul, by acquiring knowledge of the scriptures like the Kapiladi Shastras and Agamas, recognizes the path of purity. In it, knowledge-infused detachment manifests. ||17||

One whose actions are not primarily focused on the practice of self and other scriptures, does not attain the essence of pure karma from the perspective of certainty. ||18||

**Meaning:** The ascetic soul whose actions are not primarily focused on the practice of self and other scriptures (according to their teachings), does not attain the essential fruit of pure karma from the perspective of certainty. ||18||

The scripture states that Samyaktvam (right faith) is Maun (silence/munitvam) and Maun is Samyaktvam, indicating their interdependence. Therefore, Samyaktvam is the essence. ||19||

**Meaning:** Because the scripture states that Samyaktvam is Maun (silence/munitvam) and Maun is Samyaktvam, indicating their interdependence. Therefore, Samyaktvam is the essence. ||19||

Knowledge is the fruit of being free from Asrava (influx of karma), and the fruit of being free from Asrava is non-attachment to objects. The manifestation of both is Samyaktvam. Thus, there is certainty of their oneness. ||20||

**Verse 21:**

* **Translation:** Abstinence alone is the essence of conduct in the practical sense. But in terms of the inward inclination, the essence is true knowledge.

**Verse 22:**

**Verse 23:**

* **Translation:** All the verbal categories, past, present, and future, and all the categories of meaning, together constitute one single substance.

**Verse 24:**

* **Translation:** Thus, it is appropriate to understand that the same substance, being united with its own and other categories, becomes the essence of all things. Its own nature is due to its inherent qualities, and its other nature is due to its distinct characteristics.

Meaning: Just as the synonyms of the sage's knowledge, vision, and character are different, yet remain together, so are these synonyms of the object, due to their use, from the point of view of determination. From the point of view of practice, there is only one soul. ||27||

If there is no search for the relationship of the soul, what will be the path? In the duality of the basis and the competitor, there is no separation of the two. ||28|| 

Page #63:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** If this is not the case, then what will be the movement in the investigation of the absence? Therefore, the relationship between the base and the competitor exists in both of them, but it does not exist separately in both of them. ||28||

**Meaning:** In the sutra, it is said that everything is one due to the synthesis (relationship) of self-synonyms and other synonyms. That is, one who knows one substance knows all substances, and one who knows all substances knows one substance completely. ||29||

**Meaning:** By taking refuge in attachment, skill, practice, and self-work, etc., a wise man knows all substances from the essence, even by taking refuge in one synonym. ||30||

**Meaning:** Although there is no manifestation of each substance without perfect knowledge, and in some cases, the authority of one part is excessive. ||31|| 

Page #64:
---------------------------
The (knowledge) of the Grahaṇa takes place, however, the pseudo-knowers obtain knowledge with many synonyms. ||31||
Faith in the Anekānta-āgama and also unwavering always. Only the Samyak-drishți would have the complete meaning - deliberation. ||32||
Meaning: Even so, the Samyak-drishți man has continuous unwavering faith in the Āgamas inspired by Anekānta, and it is through that faith that the complete meaning can be deliberated. ||32||
From the exposition of the meaning of the Āgama, the knowledge of the wise is all-pervasive. The conduct of actions, etc., is like the crest of his definite statement. ||33||
Meaning: By taking recourse to the exposition - meaning-creation - of the meanings of the Āgama, the wise man obtains all-pervasive knowledge, and his conduct of actions, etc., is like the crest of his definite statement. ||33||
Whoever, even though a detached seeker, holds on to one side only in an exclusive manner, is a wrong-grasping person; because such a wrong-grasping person, being an obstacle to the meaning of the scriptures, is a pseudo-Jain and a sinner. ||34||
Meaning: Therefore, whoever, even though a detached seeker, holds on to one side only in an exclusive manner, is a wrong-grasping person; because such a wrong-grasping person, being an obstacle to the meaning of the scriptures, is a pseudo-Jain and a sinner. ||34||
||34||
In renunciation or in criticism, in conduct or in determination,
In knowledge or in action, if this is not there, then there is no knowledge-essence. ||35||

Adhyātma-sāra 

Page #65:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Verse 35:**

**Meaning:** If this renunciation of attachment is about the subject of renunciation, about exceptions, about conduct or determination, or about knowledge or action, then it is not called knowledge-infused detachment.

**Verse 36:**

**Meaning:** All Nayas are true in their own context, and meaningless (false) in considering another's perspective. Thus, until there is a middle ground in all Nayas, it should be understood that there is no knowledge-infused detachment.

**Verse 37:**

**Meaning:** Just as the number one hundred is included in the number of the other half, similarly, if there is no skill in including (reducing) the subjects of other darshanas in the Swagam (Jain Agamas), then it should be considered that there is no knowledge-infused detachment in that practitioner.

**Verse 38:**

**Meaning:** If there is no skill in applying the meanings of the Agamas and the logical ones in their respective places, then there is no knowledge-infused detachment.

**Chapter Six**

**65** 

Page #66:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** If a seeker does not have the ability to combine the meanings (words) that are acceptable by command, as "command-acceptable," and the meanings (things) that are acceptable by logic, as "logic-acceptable," in their proper place, then their dispassion is not knowledge-filled. ||38||

**Meaning:** Therefore, it is proven that knowledge-filled dispassion can only be for the meaning of the scriptures; formally, the meaning of the non-scriptures is also considered knowledge-filled dispassion in the reliance of the meaning of the scriptures. ||39||

**Meaning:** Subtle vision, a sense of mediation, thinking of the benefit of all, utmost respect for action, engaging people in Dharma, being like a mute, blind, and deaf person in the affairs of others, enthusiasm in practicing one's own virtues, like a poor person earning wealth, suppressing the intoxication of pride, crushing pride, severing the thread of envy, immersing oneself in the nectar of equality. ||40-42||

**Meaning:** Never wavering from one's nature, always being filled with knowledge-bliss, this is the series of characteristics of the third type of dispassion. ||43|| 

Page #67:
---------------------------
Effort like that of the mute, blind, and deaf in regard to words, the same and such enthusiasm for the practice of increasing the qualities of oneself or the soul, as much and as much enthusiasm as a poor man has for earning wealth; and the vomiting (abandonment) of the madness (sexual arousal) of Kamadeva, the killing (destruction) of the eight groups of pride like caste, family, etc., the eradication of even a thread (particle) of envy (fault-finding and jealousy), diving into the nectar of equality, always remaining unshakable (firm) in one's own nature of knowledge and bliss, this is considered the characteristic of the third detachment (knowledge-filled detachment). ||40-41-42-43|| Knowledge-filled is given here, from the two, their own suppression. Use may sometimes be from the grace of one's own spirituality. ||44||
Meaning: Of the three types of detachment mentioned above, knowledge-filled detachment is the one to be adopted here; the other two types of detachment may be of use, perhaps, from the grace of one's own spirituality, in relation to their own destruction (annihilation).
|| Thus ends the chapter on the types of detachment ||

## Chapter Seven
[On Dispassion]

Dispassion in this world arises in two ways: in relation to objects and in relation to qualities. The first is called "secondary" and the second "primary" by the wise in the spiritual realm. ||1||

**Meaning:** On this earth, two types of dispassion prevail - one in relation to objects and the other in relation to qualities. The wise in spirituality have called the first dispassion "secondary" and the second "primary". ||1||

Even when objects are experienced or heard about through tradition, they do not create any disturbance for the dispassionate seeker, just as a person immersed in nectar does not experience poison. ||2||

**Meaning:** Even when objects are experienced or heard about through scriptures or from experienced individuals, they do not create any disturbance for the dispassionate seeker, just as a person immersed in nectar does not experience poison. ||2||

The mind of the yogi, absorbed in the tranquil and unstruck sound of Om, is not intoxicated by the sweet fragrance of a vast mango tree filled with blooming flowers and the chirping of cuckoos and crows. ||3||

**Meaning:** The mind of the yogi, absorbed in the tranquil and unstruck sound of Om, is not intoxicated by the sweet fragrance of a vast mango tree filled with blooming flowers and the chirping of cuckoos and crows. ||3|| 

Page #69:
---------------------------


Page #70:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** Just as the soul, devoid of afflictions and perceived only through experience, is delightful to yogis, so this physical form (beauty), filled with afflictions (perishable) and the object of the physical eye, is not pleasing to others. ||7||

**Meaning:** A foolish man finds joy in this (object of the eye) by seeing the movements (gait), grace, laughter, and gestures of women, but the eyes of the detached do not even glance at these women, who are like vajras (thunderbolts) in their ability to pierce the mountain of good deeds. ||8||

**Meaning:** The fragrance of musk, jasmine, clove, sandalwood, and camphor does not bring joy to the wise, whose bodies are fragrant with the virtue of a love that is free from attachment and that is a barrier to Cupid. ||9||

**Meaning:** That which is used for a long time and which the wind takes away, does not deserve love here, for the fragrance of virtue is superior to it. ||10|| 

Page #71:
---------------------------
**Verse 10**

Meaning: In this world, it is not appropriate to be attached to anything other than the fragrance of good conduct, which is used for a long time and cannot be taken away by the wind of worldly desires.

**Verse 11**

Meaning: Just as bees, delighted by the pollen of blooming lotuses, do not have any eagerness for tasteless flowers, similarly, virtuous people who relish the nectar of spirituality do not have any eagerness for worldly pleasures.

**Verse 12**

Meaning: If the mind is immersed in the ninth, peaceful rasa, which is pure and free from constant change, then what benefit is there from other rasas that are full of terrible (unfavorable) consequences, superficially pleasurable (only during the time of enjoyment), and full of change? Nothing at all.

**Verse 13**

Meaning: When they taste sweet rasa, the tongues of those who are greedy for taste start to water. But for those who are detached, their eyes water after they have experienced the true nature of the fruit of their actions. 

Page #72:
---------------------------


Page #73:
---------------------------
Therefore, for the detached-minded ascetics, no worldly subject is pleasurable, and being immersed in the supreme bliss, they are indifferent to other pleasures, and are not desirous of heavenly happiness. ||17||

Deities are also afflicted by the fever of pride, delusion, sorrow, and envy. Therefore, their happiness, like milk mixed with poison, does not reach the level of pleasantness. ||18||

When the deities in heaven suffer from the fire of separation from their celestial consorts, fanned by the wind of many eyes, how can there be a state of happiness there? ||19||

Even when contemplating the fall from the heavenly realm, the heart of the deities possessing great celestial mansions does not break, as it is made of the thunderbolt of the Ghusa clan. ||20|| 

Page #74:
---------------------------
It does not break, because their heart is made of the atoms of vajra. ||20||

Desire for objects is not for those who seek liberation, not even in all the four paths. Just as one who desires sandalwood trees in a dense forest of sandalwood trees does not have any affection for other trees growing on mountainous land, similarly, yogis who seek liberation do not have any affection for the objects of the four paths. ||21||

Meaning: Thus, for the yogi who has established the essence of detachment in his pure intellect, detachment from his own qualities also arises. ||22||

Meaning: The gains obtained through association, such as vast knowledge, gooseflesh, wandering, and strong poison, are like straw to a detached mind; they cannot produce pride in him. ||23||

Page #75:
---------------------------
Even an excess of virtues, which is a source of pride for the wise, does not make them feel superior. For they are naturally joyful in their pure self-nature and do not consider anyone superior to themselves. ||24||

**Meaning:** Even an excess of virtues, which is a source of pride for the wise, does not make them feel superior. For they are naturally joyful in their pure self-nature and do not consider anyone superior to themselves. ||24||

When a yogi's practice becomes detached, even their heart does not have any desire for liberation. This state, where one is united with the waves of innate bliss, is desirable for the seeker. ||25||

**Meaning:** When a yogi's practice becomes detached, even their heart does not have any desire for liberation. This state, where one is united with the waves of innate bliss, is desirable for the seeker. ||25||

Thus, the mind of a great sage, filled with the delight of detachment, is approached by the glories of liberation, eager to bestow their blessings upon him, who is of noble nature. ||26||

**Meaning:** Thus, the mind of a great sage, filled with the delight of detachment, is approached by the glories of liberation, eager to bestow their blessings upon him, who is of noble nature. ||26||

|| Thus ends the second chapter of the Adhyatma Sara, composed by Shri Mahapadhyaya Shri Yashovijaya Gani. ||

**Chapter Seven**

Page #76:
---------------------------
## Chapter Eight
[Mamtav-Tyag] Only the dispassionate one attains stability. Therefore, the wise seeker should abandon mamta, which is the cause of great misery. ||1||

**Meaning:** The dispassionate man's detachment alone achieves stability; therefore, the wise seeker should abandon mamta, which is the cause of great misery. ||1||

What is the benefit of abandoning objects if mamta remains awake? Just as a snake does not become non-poisonous by abandoning its skin, so too, mamta does not disappear by abandoning objects. ||2||

**Meaning:** What is the benefit of abandoning objects if mamta remains awake? Just as a snake does not become non-poisonous by abandoning its skin, so too, mamta does not disappear by abandoning objects. ||2||

The sage, with great effort, cultivates a collection of virtues. But mamta, like a demon, devours all those virtues in one gulp. ||3||

**Meaning:** The sage, with great effort, cultivates a collection of virtues. But mamta, like a demon, devours all those virtues in one gulp. ||3||

For a long time, the restrained sage, through penance, vows, self-control, rules, and control of the senses, with great effort, acquires virtues... 

Page #77:
---------------------------
The soul is equipped, all those eternal qualities are devoured in one gulp by the demonic attachment (kama-rupa) ॥3॥ By the power of ignorance-like medicine, the wife, attachment, plays with the husband, who is like an animal, by many means ॥4॥
Meaning: Oh! The wife, attachment, by the power of ignorance-like medicine, quickly makes the husband, who is like an animal, play and dance by many means ॥4॥ One goes to the next life alone, and is born alone, then by excessive attachment, he creates all relationships in his mind ॥5॥
Meaning: The soul goes to the next life alone and is born alone, then by excessive attachment, he creates all relationships in his mind ॥5॥ Just as a banyan tree, born from one seed, covers a vast land, so too, from the seed of attachment, the vast universe is imagined ॥6॥
Meaning: Just as a banyan tree, born from one seed, covers a vast land, so too, from the seed of attachment, the vast universe is imagined ॥6॥ My mother, my father, my brother, my sister, my beloved, my sons, my daughters, my friends, my relatives, my praised ones ॥7॥
Chapter Eight
77 

Page #78:
---------------------------
Meaning: This is my mother, this is my brother, this is my sister, this is my beloved, these are my sons and daughters, these are my friends; these are my relatives, these are my acquaintances. In this way, as a person grows older in the world, his attachment grows further and further. ||7||

Meaning: Thus, the disease of attachment keeps increasing every moment. Without the great medicine of knowledge, a person cannot eradicate this disease of attachment. ||8||

Meaning: Due to attachment, a being starts with no hesitation in undertaking various activities. Driven by the greed of wealth, he runs around all the time, regardless of whether it is appropriate or not. ||9||

Meaning: Those for whose sustenance a person is distressed due to attachment; they are not a refuge or a shelter for him in this world or the next. ||10|| 

Page #79:
---------------------------
And they are not ready to protect or give refuge in the afterlife.  Beings, under the influence of attachment, nurture their relatives, children, etc., and suffer in many ways for them, but when any calamity or distress befalls them, or they are caught in some trouble, or mental anguish arises due to divine destiny, then those children and relatives turn their eyes away; they turn their faces away, they do not come to protect them, nor do they give them shelter. When they cannot give protection and shelter in this world, being their own, then how can they be protectors and refuge-givers in the afterlife (heaven, etc.)? Everyone is engrossed in their own self-interest, knowing all this, yet the ignorant, under the influence of egotism, continues to nurture them, doing nothing for himself. ||10||

By attachment, one nourishes many worlds with his own earnings; but he alone endures the intense sufferings of hell. ||11||

Meaning: Due to attachment, a man alone earns wealth and nourishes many people with it, but as a result, he alone suffers the intense pains of hell. Thinking, "This son, family, etc., are mine, they should not suffer even a little," he alone earns wealth and nourishes many people without seeking anyone's help. 

Page #80:
---------------------------
He does so. He happily brings whatever they ask for; as a result of that sinful act, he alone suffers terrible torments in hell. When he endures those terrible torments, no one, including his son, comes to his aid. On the contrary, his son and others, having received the wealth left behind by the deluded person, enjoy themselves, while he, poor fellow, alone suffers torment in hell. Therefore, one should renounce attachment, the root of all suffering. ||11||

The one blinded by attachment does not see what exists, but the one blinded by attachment sees what does not exist as existing. This is the great difference between the two. ||12||

**Meaning:** A person born blind does not see what exists, but a person blinded by attachment sees what does not exist as existing. This is the great difference between the two. ||12||

By contemplating the impermanence of life, one develops love for the beloved even more. Considering the beloved as one's own life, one rejoices due to attachment. ||13||

**Meaning:** Under the sway of attachment, a being considers his beloved, who destroys his life, as inseparable or impermanent, and therefore, due to excessive love, considers her more precious than life itself and rejoices. ||13||

1. In some places, the reading is "inseparability" instead of "impermanence."

She considers it pure even when it becomes impure (dirty) or even when its excrement (dung) etc. are impure. ||19||
Even though the relationship with parents etc. is uncertain, it appears certain due to attachment. ||20||
Meaning: For those whose hearts are filled with strong delusion, even the uncertain relationship with parents, etc., appears certain due to attachment. ||20||
Each soul is different, each pudgala is also different. There is no connection, whoever sees this, sees. ||21||
Meaning: Each soul is different, each pudgala is different from the soul, and there is no connection between them, whoever sees this, sees (the seer). ||21||
Due to the delusion of ownership and selfhood, which is the cause of ego and attachment, they flee from the knowledge of difference, like snakes from the knowledge of a rope. ||22||
Meaning: Just as the delusion of a snake is destroyed by the knowledge of a rope, so too the delusion of ownership and selfhood, which is the cause of ego and attachment, is destroyed by the knowledge of difference. ||22||
The question "What is this?" arises in the face of the knowledge of the truth. Where can attachment stand when there is no connection? ||23||
Chapter Eight
83 

Page #84:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** 'What is this?' The curiosity that arises in the face of knowledge of Tattvantika (Jain philosophy) does not allow delusion to arise, then how will it allow attachment to remain stable? ||23||

**Meaning:** Just as a lover desiring a beloved does not find pleasure anywhere without the beloved, similarly, a seeker of truth does not find peace anywhere without attaining the knowledge of truth (Paramarthajnan). His interest is not in any object other than the knowledge of truth. ||24||

**Meaning:** Therefore, the egoistic mind hinders curiosity. And then that man, overwhelmed by various kinds of acting, appears confused (bewildered). ||25||

**Meaning:** The one who has adopted yoga (munijeevan), but his attachment has not died, and he has not attained equality, and the truth has not been inquired into, then his birth has been wasted. ||26|| 

Page #85:
---------------------------
॥26॥
If one has adopted [the teachings] with faith, but has not inquired into the Truth, then know that his human birth has gone in vain. ||26||
Inquiry and discrimination are the two destroyers of attachment. Therefore, one should subdue attachment, the enemy of spirituality, by these two. ||27||
Meaning: Inquiry and discrimination are the two destroyers of attachment. Therefore, one should subdue attachment, the enemy of spirituality, by these two. Attachment is the enemy of spirituality, wherever it enters, it destroys the culmination of spirituality. Therefore, to restrain this (attachment), one should adopt the inquiry into the Truth and the discrimination between the body and the soul, or the self and the other. By these two, one should expel the enemy of attachment from the house of the heart; or one should subdue it well and become absorbed in spirituality. ||27||
॥ Thus ends the chapter on the renunciation of attachment. ||

## Ninth Right: Equality

[Equality] When attachment is abandoned, equality arises naturally. Just as the quality of clarity manifests in a crystal free from impurities, so too does equality manifest when attachment is abandoned. ||1||

**Meaning:** Just as the quality of clarity manifests naturally in a crystal free from impurities, so too does equality manifest naturally when attachment is abandoned. ||1||

The idea of preference or aversion towards objects arises from our perception. True equality is achieved by abandoning this perception and becoming steady and unwavering. ||2||

**Meaning:** The idea of preference or aversion towards objects arises from our perception. True equality is achieved by abandoning this perception and becoming steady and unwavering. ||2||

A person who hates these very objects, and who is attached to them, does not truly understand that from the perspective of true knowledge, nothing is desirable or undesirable. It is only through perception that we create these ideas. ||3||

**Meaning:** A person who hates these very objects, and who is attached to them, does not truly understand that from the perspective of true knowledge, nothing is desirable or undesirable. It is only through perception that we create these ideas. ||3|| 

Page #87:
---------------------------
A human being finds that objects like clothes, ornaments, women, food, etc., which are helpful for their primary purpose, become obstacles and undesirable when they become useless. The object that was previously disliked becomes desirable when it is needed. Therefore, the concept of liking and disliking depends on the purpose and its absence. In reality, no object is truly desirable or undesirable. It is only through the imagination of the mind that a human being considers an object desirable or undesirable. A wise seeker should abandon this imagination and accept equality. ||3||

What is a subject for one person, due to their own opinion, is considered nourishing (pleasing), the same subject becomes hateful (unpleasant) for another person due to their different opinion. ||4||

Therefore, these two, desirable and undesirable, are both imagined by the mind, they are not true in reality. Just like duality, this duality is also a product of imagination. ||5||

_ Meaning: Therefore, desirable and undesirable, both are imagined by the mind, they are not true in reality. _

Chapter Ninth 

Page #88:
---------------------------
By transcending alternatives (nivrutti), duality and the like, including the desirable and undesirable, are destroyed; then the quality of equanimity manifests. ||5||

When one's own purpose is fulfilled, one's own autonomy shines forth. When this happens, the arising of thoughts about external objects is destroyed. ||6||

Meaning: When the seeker begins to perceive that the fulfillment of their purpose is in their own hands, then the arising of thoughts about external objects is destroyed. ||6||

When delusion is destroyed, the true nature of the self is realized, like a necklace of gold worn around the neck. This leads to the non-arising of attachment and aversion, resulting in unhindered equanimity. ||7||

Meaning: When delusion is destroyed, the true nature of the self is realized, like a necklace of gold worn around the neck. This leads to the non-arising of attachment and aversion, resulting in unhindered equanimity. ||7||

When the karmically created duality (dualism) in the beings of the world is not perceived due to the limit of pure knowledge, then unhindered equanimity is attained. ||8||

Meaning: When the karmically created duality (dualism) in the beings of the world is not perceived due to the limit of pure knowledge, then unhindered equanimity is attained. ||8||

When one's mind is content in the self, due to the steadfastness in one's own qualities and the conviction of oneness, then one's equanimity is unsurpassed. ||9|| 

Page #89:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** Consider the equality of that person whose mind dwells only in the soul, due to the firm conviction of oneness, the qualities of the soul, and the state of being one with the sole soul. Consider the equality of that seeker to be the most excellent, whose mind becomes absorbed in the soul, due to the understanding of oneness in all souls (from the perspective of the non-dualistic viewpoint), the abandonment of the perception of duality in the qualities of the soul like knowledge, etc., and the continuous, unwavering, single, result-soul nature, like a lump of iron, without any expectation of production, destruction, etc. ||9||

**Meaning:** With the maturity of equality, the attachment to objects ceases, and in that state, the pure yogis become equal in both the states of being chopped by an axe and being worshipped with sandalwood. ||10||

**Meaning:** O virtuous one! How much praise can we offer your equality, which, due to the purpose of the soul, destroys the enmity of even those who are eternally enemies, even when they are present. ||11|| 

Page #90:
---------------------------
Equipped with many virtues, they pacify the animosity of those beings who are constantly opposed to each other, even if they are close by. ||11||

What is the benefit of giving or doing penance? Or what is the benefit of following the yamas and niyamas? Only equality should be worshipped, which is like a boat in the ocean of the world. ||12||

Meaning: What is the benefit of giving or doing penance? Or what is the benefit of following the yamas and niyamas? Only equality should be worshipped, which is like a boat in the ocean of the world. ||12||

The happiness of heaven is far away, and the path of liberation is even farther away. But the happiness of equality, which is close to one's mind, is clear and evident. ||13||

Meaning: The happiness of heaven is far away, and the path of liberation is even farther away. But the happiness of equality, which is close to one's mind, is clear and evident. The happiness of the gods who live in the heavenly realm, which arises from the five senses and their objects, is far away and beyond the reach of the senses, such as the eyes. Therefore, it is far away. And the place of liberation, which is full of infinite happiness, is even farther away. These two are not clearly visible. But the natural, independent, and close-to-the-mind happiness of equality, which arises from the cessation of attachment and aversion, is directly experienced and is in one's heart. 

Page #91:
---------------------------
It has been seen, therefore it is clearly near and experienced, while the happiness of heaven etc. or of liberation is indirect, therefore it is not experienced. ||13|| The poison of lust in the eyes dries up, the heat of anger is destroyed, the dirt of arrogance is destroyed by bathing in the pool of nectar of equality. ||14||
Meaning: By bathing in the pool of nectar of equality, the poison of lust in the eyes dries up, the heat of anger is destroyed, the dirt of arrogance is destroyed. In this forest of the world, burning with the fire of old age and death, equality alone is like a rain of nectar for happiness and peace. ||15||
Meaning: In this forest of the world, burning with the fire of old age and death, equality alone is like a rain of nectar for happiness and peace. ||15|| By relying on equality alone, Bharata Chakravarti etc. have attained liberation, they did not do anything painful. ||16||
Meaning: By relying on equality alone, Bharata Chakravarti etc. have attained liberation, they did not do anything painful. ||16|| The gate of hell is a barrier, the lamp of the path to liberation. Equality is the earth of ascent in the collection of virtues. ||17||
Authority Ninth
91 

Page #92:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** Equality is like the threshold of a door that prevents a being from entering hell, it is like a lamp that illuminates the path to liberation, it is like Mount Meru that gathers the jewels of virtues. Therefore, equality is a destroyer of evil and a promoter of good for the seeker. ||17||

**Meaning:** For those whose eyes are covered with delusion, and who cannot see the nature of the soul, equality is like a divine collyrium stick (ointment), which destroys ignorance and other defects like an eye disease. When the diseases of the divine eye (ignorance, etc.) are destroyed, the nature of the soul can be clearly known. ||18||

**Meaning:** If a being, even for a moment, draws its mind away from all objects and practices equality, the happiness it experiences cannot be described to others. That is, it is an unparalleled joy that is indescribable. Only one who has attained equality can experience the joy of equality. ||19|| 

Page #93:
---------------------------
Kumari na yatha vetti sukham dayitbhogjam | Na janati tatha loko yoginam samatasukham ||20||
**Meaning:** Just as a virgin girl does not know the pleasure of conjugal bliss, so too worldly people do not know the equanimity-bliss attained by yogis. ||20||

Nati-stutyadhika-samsasha-sarastivraḥ svamarmabhit | Samata-varmaguptānām nārtikṛtso'pi jāyate ||21||
**Meaning:** The desire for bowing, praise, appreciation, fame, etc., are sharp arrows that pierce the very core of the seeker's soul; but for those who have already protected their soul by wearing the armor of equanimity, these are not painful. ||21||

Prachitānyapi karmāni janmanām koṭikoṭibhiḥ | Tamāṁsi-va prabhā bhānoḥ kṣiṇoti samatā kṣaṇāt ||22||
**Meaning:** Just as the light of the sun destroys even the densest darkness in an instant, so too equanimity destroys the accumulated karma of countless births in an instant. ||22||

Anyalingādisiddānām ādhāraḥ samataiva hi | Ratnatrayaphalaprapteḥ yayā syād bhāvajainatā ||23||
**Meaning:** Equanimity is the foundation for the attainment of the Siddhas, who are free from all limitations. It is through equanimity that one attains the three jewels and becomes a true Jain in spirit. ||23||

**Chapter Nine**
93 

Page #94:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** Those who have attained liberation (siddha) through means like other-gender (different attire from Jain practitioners) etc., have achieved this liberation through the foundation of equality. This equality leads to the attainment of the three jewels - right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct - resulting in the attainment of Jainhood. ||23|| This equality is also the fruit of knowledge that establishes all the principles in their respective places. Otherwise, that knowledge becomes ashes due to wrong attachment (kadagrah) just like sandalwood becomes ashes in fire. ||24|| If the life force of the person embodied in conduct departs due to the absence of equality, then the enthusiasm of people rushing to pay their respects to him is like a celebration of his death. ||25|| Any action that is performed by abandoning the principle of equality is like a seed sown in barren land, which does not yield the desired fruit. ||26||

## Chapter Ten

**[Sadanushtan]** Anushtan becomes pure due to samata (equality). Just as the powder of katak (purifier) purifies impure water, so too does anushtan become pure through the yoga of samata. ||1||

**Meaning:** Just as the powder of katak (purifier) purifies impure water, so too does anushtan become pure through the yoga of samata. ||1||

Poison, gar (heat), non-anushtan, its cause, and the supreme nectar are the five types of anushtan. ||2||

**Meaning:** Guru seva (service to the guru) and other anushtans are said to be of five types: poison, gar (heat), non-anushtan, its cause, and the supreme nectar. ||2||

Anushtan done with the desire for food, wealth, worship, or prosperity is called visha-anushtan because it quickly destroys the pure mind. ||3||

**Meaning:** Anushtan done with the desire for food, wealth, worship, or prosperity is called visha-anushtan because it quickly destroys the pure mind. ||3||

Both stationary and mobile beings, when consumed at that moment, are poison. Just as they kill, so too does this destroy the pure mind from worldly enjoyment. ||4||

**Adhyatma Sara** 

Page #97:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** Just as a stationary or mobile poison kills the one who eats it immediately, so too does this poisonous ritual, when performed with the desire for worldly pleasures - the desire for favorable food, etc. in this life - destroy the auspicious mind. ||4||

**Meaning:** Due to the desire for divine pleasures, the performance of the ritual leads to the destruction of the fruits of one's virtuous actions in the future. Therefore, such a ritual performed with such a desire is called a "gara-anusthana". ||5||

**Meaning:** Just as the poison called "gara", which arises from the combination of impure substances, kills in the future, so too does this "gara-anusthana" truly kill the soul in the future (in the next life, etc.). ||6||

**Meaning:** To prohibit these two types of rituals, which cause various kinds of harm, the Tirthankaras have declared them to be the cause of all suffering. ||7|| 

Page #98:
---------------------------
The Bhagavants have prohibited all (actions with) causation. ||7|| Due to the absence of pranidhana (concentration of mind) etc., the action of a man without adhyavasaya (firm resolve) is called ananushthana, like the activity of a mind devoid of sammoochhim (awareness) or an action done in imitation. ||8|| The term "oghasanjna" here refers to the general knowledge that is the binding factor, and "lokasanjña" refers to the path of the faultless sutras, which is independent of the path of the faultless sutras. ||9|| The one who acts due to oghasanjna does not depend on the world, the sutras, or the guru's words; he does something or the other without the firm resolve of his soul. ||10|| Those who argue that the destruction of tirthas (sacred places) would occur in the search for the pure, call the respect and faith in the customs of the world as lokasanjña. ||11|| 98

---------------------------
**Meaning:** Those who say that the destruction of the Tirtha (sacred place) occurs only by seeking the pure path, are called Lokasankhya (people who follow the popular opinion) because they respect and revere the popular trend and act accordingly. ||11||

**Meaning:** Even the necessary things, which are adorned with the words like "educated" etc., are called necessary in terms of substance. Then what to say about the impure necessary, which is devoid of essence? It cannot even be called a necessary substance. ||12||

**Meaning:** Alas! By embracing the impure out of fear of the destruction of the Tirtha, the scriptural practices are lost due to the tendency to follow the past. How then can the Tirtha be protected? ||13||

**Meaning:** If many people have done a certain task, then the righteous person should also do it. If this is said, then the Dharma (righteousness) of the misguided should never be abandoned. ||14||

Therefore, the religion performed by the Mithyadrishtis will never be abandoned, it will remain eternal. ||14|| Therefore, whatever is done by Gatyanugatya, that is, without the Sutras, without the rules of conduct, from the Oghaloka, from the world, that is, from imitation, is considered to be Ananushtana. ||15||
Meaning: Therefore, the practice done by Gatyanugatya, that is, without the Sutras, without the rules of conduct, from the Oghaloka, from the world, that is, from imitation, is considered to be Ananushtana. Therefore, it should be abandoned because it is not conducive to liberation. ||15||
Akama Nirjara is caused by physical exertion, such as getting up, sitting down, and vigorous movement. Saka Nirjara, on the other hand, is caused by a pure and purposeful approach to the goal. ||16||
Meaning: This practice, due to the physical exertion involved in getting up, sitting down, and vigorous movement, leads to excessive physical labor, which in turn becomes a cause of Akama Nirjara. That is, because it is not born out of the desire for liberation, this practice does not become a cause of liberation. Therefore, this practice (Ananushtana), being a cause of merit that leads some to the human realm and others to the Vyantara realm, becomes a cause of worldly happiness, as the wise men have said in the Agamas. But Saka Nirjara, that is, the practice done with a pure and purposeful approach to the goal, is the only way to achieve liberation. Therefore, Ananushtana, which is a practice that is not conducive to liberation,

Only a rare man who is a **Sakaamani** (one who has attained liberation) can achieve **Nirjara** (destruction of karma), not many others. Therefore, it is to be abandoned. ||16||

**Sadanushthana** (right conduct) is the path for those who are **Taddhetu** (motivated by the right cause). This is also achieved by those who are **Charmaavarti** (in the final stage of existence) without **Anabhoga** (enjoyment of the fruits of karma). ||17||

**Bhavartha:** Men who follow the path are motivated by their love for **Sadanushthana** (right conduct) and perform **Taddhetu** (right conduct). This conduct is achieved by those who are **Charmaavarti** (in the final stage of existence) without **Anabhoga** (enjoyment of the fruits of karma). ||17||

This **Charma Pudgalparavartakal** (final stage of existence) is the youth of **Dharma** (religion), while the rest of the time is the childhood of **Bhava** (existence). In this **Charma Pudgalparavartakal**, there is a love for **Satkriya** (righteous actions), while in the earlier stages, there is respect for **Asatkriya** (unrighteous actions). ||18||

In this context, a man who has attained puberty finds immoral actions shameful due to his devotion to Dharma. ||19||  The fourth (Taddhetu) practice is prescribed in the final stage of life, because of devotion to Dharma, and it is in accordance with the order of seed, etc. ||20||
Meaning: Therefore, in the final stage of life, due to devotion to Dharma, the fourth (Taddhetu) practice is described, which is in accordance with the order of seed, etc. ||20||  The seed here is the desire to perform actions with pure objects, seeing people who perform pure practices in the Jain religion, and being honored and praised by them. ||21||
Meaning: In the context of the Jain religion, seeing people who perform pure practices, the desire to perform actions with pure objects, through their honor, praise, and respect, is the seed here. ||21||  The unblemished consequence of that desire is called the sprout. The diverse investigation of its cause is described as the trunk. ||22||
Meaning: The unblemished consequence of that desire to perform pure practices is called the sprout. And the diverse investigation of its cause is described as the trunk. ||22||  The diverse activities in these are considered similar to leaves, etc. The flower is the characteristic of the attainment of the cause, such as the Guru's guidance. ||23|| 102

**Meaning:** In those rituals, the peculiar type of tendency is considered to be like a letter, and the attainment of prosperity due to reasons like Guru Samagam, etc., is called the form of a flower. ||23||

**Meaning:** Thus, the attainment of Bhavadharma in the form of Sad-deshana, etc., should be understood here as the fruit that is definitely conducive to liberation. ||24||

_ **Meaning:** Contemplation of the meaning of the scriptures, concentration of the mind on the subject of action, and the absence of error in the limbs such as time, etc., are the characteristics of Amrita Anushthan. ||27||  Two of these five types of Anushthan are Sat (true) and the first three are Asat (false). Among those last two Anushthan, the last one is the best because it destroys the poison of delusion. ||28||  Respect, delight in performing the action, absence of obstacles, attainment of wealth such as knowledge, inquisitiveness, and service to the knowledgeable, these are the characteristics of Sad Anushthan. ||29||  This fourfold Yoga, known as Anushthan, is differentiated by desire, action, stability, and attainment, and it connects the soul with liberation. ||30|| 104

**Verse 35:**

**Translation:**  Through faith, intelligence, and other such sentiments towards the *Kayotsarga* and other *sutras*, those who have renounced the world and have taken the vow of universal renunciation achieve success in the *iccha* (desire) and other *yogas*.

**Verse 36:**

**Translation:** Just as there are different types of sweetness in jaggery, sugar, etc., so too in this *yoga*, there are differences in the *iccha* and other sentiments among different individuals. However, these differences do not constitute a fault, as the *iccha* and other objects are still connected (in their essence).

**Verse 37:**

**Translation:** The *acharyas* (teachers) say that it is a blatant falsehood to teach this *shastra* to someone who does not even have a trace of *iccha* and other *yogas*.

**Verse 38:**

**Translation:** This principle should be understood by those who know the *Yoga-Vimsatika*: when one consumes an inappropriate or unsuitable cause, it is like raising up a wrong path.

It has been done, or awakened. This principle is worth considering for the knowers of Yoga Vimstika. || 38 ||
The practice of Sadanuṣṭhāna should be performed in three ways with a pure mind, knowing the harmony of time and abandoning the worldly consciousness. || 39 ||

Even while practicing non-attachment (nivrutti), renouncing sensual pleasures (kamabhoga), and even while enduring suffering, one with a false view (mithyadristi) does not attain liberation (siddhi). ||4||

Just as the pupil is the essence of the eye and fragrance is the essence of a flower, so too, Samyaktvam is the essence of all religious practices (dharma karma). ||5||

This Samyaktvam is described as Tattvasraddhan in the teachings of the Jinas (Jinasasana), and the principle "All beings should not be killed" is declared as the essence (tattva) in the scriptures. ||6||

This (ahimsa) is pure dharma (shuddha dharma), and this (shraddhan) is the characteristic of the pure taste (ruchira) of dharma. ||7||

**Meaning:** Or, just as this principle of non-violence is said to be based on knowledge, so too is the knowledge of the nine principles, including the soul, based on faith, knowledge, and other interests. ||8||

It is here stated that pure non-violence is the principle, therefore, the acceptance of the authority of the sutras is also right-conduct. ||9||

**Meaning:** Pure non-violence, or the pure principle, is stated only in the scriptures revealed by the Jinas. Thus, the acceptance of the authority of the sutras is also right-conduct. ||9||

The Bhagavatas say there are five vows and five observances, thus ten. And the Pashupatas say there are five yamas and five niyamas, thus ten dharmas. || 13 ||

Non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, non-attachment, and celibacy, and non-anger, honesty, purity, and non-possession are the twelve. These are called yamas by the Sankhyas, following Vyasa. || 15 ||

Ahimsa (non-violence), Satya (truthfulness), Asteya (non-stealing), Brahmacharya (celibacy) as the fourth, and Vyavahara (renunciation of possessions) as the fifth, these five are known as Yama.

The Buddhists consider ten Kusala Dharmas (virtuous actions). As they say: Himsa (violence), Asteya (stealing), Anyatha Kama (sexual misconduct), Paishunya (gossip), Parush Anrita (harsh and untrue speech), Sambhinna Alap (divisive speech), Vyapaada (anger), Abhidhya (greed), Drg Viparyaya (wrong perception), and Papa Karma (evil deeds) - these ten should be abandoned by body, speech, and mind.

Violence arises from the conjunction of the violent, and from its arising, its accomplishment occurs. And from its accomplishment, the violence of the good being is accomplished, but the violence of the ultimate reality is not accomplished by the destruction of mental activity, because the mind is inert, and it is also different from the soul. Therefore, what is destroyed in the soul by the destruction of the mind? Nothing. There is no violence of the inert, and no violence of the inert is called violence. Because it is not affected by the strike of weapons, etc. And how can mental activity be violent and the object of violence? It cannot be said that it causes the mind to be bound by sinful actions, because the mind is inert. If even the inert were to be called violent and the object of violence, then no one would be able to attain liberation. Just as the destruction of the mind would not lead to liberation from the inert substances like food, clothing, etc., so too, the attainment of violence from the inert substances would not lead to liberation. And those one-sensed beings who are without mind, will not die, because there is no absence of the destruction of mental activity. If the mind is called violent, then it will be difficult for the whole world to live; because everyone's mind is inert. ||25|| ||25||
This violence, which is in the form of the production of suffering, is not appropriate in the intellect, because the intellect is not established in the ultimate reality due to its separation from the man (soul). ||26||

It is considered extremely different. Therefore, in reality, there cannot be any arrangement of violence here. ||26|| And how can the word "violence" be synonymous with destruction? In the absolute eternity of the soul, it would be an obstacle to experience. ||27||
Meaning: Oh! If the soul is considered eternally existent, then the word "violence", which is synonymous with destruction, will in no way be an obstacle to experience. It means that it will be an obstacle to experience. ||27|| Even with the body, its connection is not possible in its eternity. And in its omnipresence, this world will undoubtedly not be imagined. ||28||
Meaning: If the soul is considered eternal, then its connection with the body etc. is not possible. If it is considered omnipresent, then undoubtedly this world will not be imagined. ||28|| The connection of the body from unseen karma would be due to other karma. Thus, if you want to establish the connection of birth, then it is not possible due to the lack of understanding of that connection. ||29||
Meaning: The connection of the body from unseen karma could be due to other karma, (therefore there is no expectation of soul action). To this, Jain theorists reply that if you want to establish the connection of birth in this way, then it is not possible

It will not be possible, because there is no knowledge of the yoga of that body (of those karmas). Therefore, without Atmakriya, the union of the body cannot happen. ||29|| How can the acceptance of the subtle atoms happen without Atmakriya? How can the conception of the difference of saṃyoga etc. also be justified? ||30||
Meaning: If there is no action in the soul, how will the acceptance of the subtle atoms known to that soul happen? It will not be possible. And how will the conception of saṃyoga and bheda etc. be justified in it? It will not be. ||30|| How can the soul attain any form without the body? This is what the opponent has said, but it is not true, because there is no yoga of the action of that soul. ||31||
Meaning: Since the soul is inactive, it never kills anyone and is never killed by anyone. Therefore, this (eternal) soul does not experience violence. ||32||

The human being etc. (the violent one) is only the cause for a moment, not the violent one for the pig etc. (the victim). Because the human being does not exist until the last moment of the pig.

Truth, etc., do not occur in reality without non-violence; because truth, etc., are like fences for the protection of non-violence. Thus, the Lord Jinendra has said.

**Verse 38:**

In the teachings of the Lord Mahavira, everything is appropriate. The soul is eternal and non-eternal, it is both different from and non-different from the body, and it is the same in itself.

The soul is eternal from the perspective of its substance, and perishable (non-eternal) from the perspective of its modifications. Therefore, it harms, is harmed, and also receives the fruits of its actions.

The consequence of the act of violence is due to evil intention. This violence does not become the nature of the physician, like that of an enemy. ||43||

Meaning: This violence, which is caused by an evil resolve, is the karmic consequence of the victim. Therefore, the physician does not acquire this violence like an enemy. ||43||

Thus, by good advice, etc., the cessation of this violence is also clear. This is because of the destruction of the sinful act with its beginning and the increase of one's own good resolve. ||44||

The seed of liberation is said to be the primary non-violence. Truth, etc., the vows, are born as new shoots from this tree of non-violence. ||45||

Meaning: Non-violence is the seed of the tree of liberation, therefore it is called the primary (religion). And truth, etc., the vows, are born as new shoots from this tree of non-violence. ||45||

The great soul, endowed with right faith, does not have any attachment to violence, which is like placing one's foot on hot iron, due to the yoga of knowledge. ||47||

The attachment of the virtuous, who are devoted to effort and devotion, to actions like worship of the Jinas, etc., is that of non-violence. ||48||

Violence arising from the actions of a wrong-faith person with a wicked mind is attached to violence, and even their non-violence is similar due to the connection with the power of ignorance. ||49||

This is the reason why the killer of living beings gradually suffers a fall from heaven. Their violence is great, leading to rebirth in the animal realm, hell, etc. ||50|| 

Page #131:

Page #132:

**Meaning:** This is the distinction from the perspective of the consequences of violence and non-violence. Due to the application of the power of cause, type, and strength, it arises immediately or later, taking into account the interval of the opposing party. ||54||

**Meaning:** Due to the attainment of specific qualities in religious work and the abandonment of the attachment to non-righteousness due to extreme devotion, only non-violence is called non-violence. ||55||

**Meaning:** The doctrine in which non-violence with hundreds of such breaks (alternatives) is described, that is the most pure Jain doctrine (Jainism) which is the proof. ||56||

There is no instruction or instructor when there is an attachment to non-existence. Therefore, how can there be any benefit from removing doubt, etc.?  || 4 ||

How can there be any benefit from removing doubt, etc., from the instruction of non-existence, etc.? Because according to the doctrine of non-existence, when there are no listeners, etc., how can the speaker benefit anyone? || 4 ||

Those who desire only certainty, their conduct is inappropriate. Just as the language of the Mlecchas is not fit for the Brahmanas, but they use it only for their own purposes, so also the instruction of conduct is inappropriate for those who desire only certainty. || 5 ||

**Meaning:** Just as a Shruta-kevali knows only the self through the Shruta (scripture), so also he knows everything through the Shruta (scripture) and through conduct. || 6 ||

The purpose of certainty cannot be directly spoken of by anyone. Conduct, through its qualities, is incapable of understanding its meaning. || 7 ||

---------------------------
**Meaning:** No one in this world is capable of directly stating the meaning of **nirnaya** (absolute truth). However, **vyavahar nay** (practical logic) is capable of conveying the meaning of **nirnaya** through its qualities. ||7||

**Meaning:** If someone claims the supremacy of **vyavahar**, how can they claim supremacy in **nirnaya**? Because both **shabdatmika** (verbal) and **jnanatmika** (knowledge-based) have equal **pararth** (other-oriented) and **swarth** (self-oriented) aspects. ||8||

**Meaning:** Therefore, due to the supremacy of **vyavahar**, the six aforementioned **padas** (categories) that negate **vyavahar** are declared as **mithyatva** (false). ||9||

**Meaning:** "There is no self because it is not perceived directly," and the declaration of **ahamta** (ego) can be attributed to the body, thus says the **Charvaka**. ||10||

Just as the intoxication does not manifest in each individual part of the liquor (but only when all the parts are combined), similarly, the manifestation of knowledge is considered to be present only when the five great elements are combined. ||11||

The diversity of kings, paupers, etc., is also not due to the power of the soul; because such natural diversity is also seen in stones, etc. ||12||

The soul cannot be understood through scriptures, because they are contradictory to each other, and no one has ever seen the soul, so how can their words be considered as evidence? ||13||

The deceiver, by speaking of the soul, the other world, and various actions, elevates the minds of the people by misleading them from their enjoyment. ||14||

Page #138:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** Cunning men corrupt the minds of people by loudly describing the soul, the afterlife, and various types of actions, causing them to be obsessed with worldly pleasures. ||14||

**Meaning:** Therefore, it is not appropriate to abandon the pleasures of this world and desire the pleasures of the future (afterlife); because after the five elements have burned to ashes, the desire to be reborn - to return to life again - is futile. ||15||

**Meaning:** For these reasons, this (Charvaka's) philosophy is false; because the soul (Atman) is directly perceived due to the non-difference of the qualities of perception, doubt, etc. ||16||

**Meaning:** The perception of ego, etc., is not the nature of the body. Because if it were, then there would necessarily be a problem with the perception of the senses like eyes, etc., just like with gravity, etc. ||17|| 

Page #139:
---------------------------
If the body itself were the soul, there would be no memory of past experiences. This is because the body is constantly changing, from childhood to old age, and so it cannot be the same entity. ||18||

**Meaning:** If the body were the soul, there would be no memory of past experiences, because the body is constantly changing, from childhood to old age, and so it cannot be the same entity. ||18||

The body cannot be the soul because even when a part of the body is lost, there is no memory of what was experienced through that part. This is like a person who has lost a window in their house still remembering what they saw through that window. ||19||

**Meaning:** The body cannot be the soul because even when a part of the body is lost, there is no memory of what was experienced through that part. This is like a person who has lost a window in their house still remembering what they saw through that window. ||19||

There is no fault in the memory being transferred from cause to effect, or from one vasana to another. This is because the fetus does not remember anything from its time in the womb, even though it has experienced the water there. ||20||

**Meaning:** There is no fault in the memory being transferred from cause to effect, or from one vasana to another. This is because the fetus does not remember anything from its time in the womb, even though it has experienced the water there. ||20|| 

Page #140:
---------------------------
The fetus in the womb of experience will also have its memory due to the transmission of experience. ||20||

**Commentary:** The perception of the stability of the vasana (tendency) of the object arising from the cause is not seen due to the unsuitability of the atom's state, as the hand, etc., are not the real cause (i.e., not the upadana-karana). ||21||

**Commentary:** Just as the power of intoxication arises from the ingredients of alcohol, but not without their mixture or the mixer, so also the manifestation of knowledge should be understood, otherwise it would always be present. ||22||

**Commentary:** The diversity of kings, beggars, etc., is also due to the karma performed by the soul, otherwise there would be no specific knowledge of happiness, sorrow, etc. ||23||

**Commentary:** The soul is known from the scriptures, which are non-contradictory to the perceived objects. The speaker of these scriptures, being free from impurities, has seen the soul. ||24|| 

Page #141:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** The soul is known through the non-contradictory Agamas (scriptural evidence) of both the seen (direct) and the desired meaning. The speaker of that Agama, the omniscient Lord, free from all faults, has seen that soul. ||24||

**Meaning:** The activities of the non-deluded men related to the next world do not go in vain. Who is that man who will put his soul in sorrow for the sake of another's bondage? None. ||25||

**Meaning:** The attainment of the soul is clearly manifested from doubt, just like a lump of earth, etc. Because doubt is also the subject of different meanings in a donkey and a horn, etc. ||26||

**Meaning:** The word 'Ajiva' also reveals the law of the existence of the soul. Because there is negation of the combination, etc., of the existing substance; there is no negation of the non-existent substances. ||27||

**Chapter 13**
**141** 

Page #142:
---------------------------
Combination, inherence, and generality, and specificity are negated for objects, but not entirely. ||28||
Meaning: The negation of objects is only in terms of combination, inherence, and generality and specificity; but the objects are not negated entirely. ||28||
The word 'Jiva' is pure and derived, like the word 'pot', and therefore meaningful. Its meaning is not the body, because the synonyms of the word 'Jiva' do not have the meaning of the body. ||29||
Meaning: Like the word 'pot', the word 'Jiva' is pure and derived, and therefore meaningful. The meaning of the word 'Jiva' cannot be the body, because the synonyms of the word 'Jiva' do not have the meaning of the body. ||29||
The Charvaka philosophy is to be rejected because of the established existence of the soul. Their pronouncements are sinful and opposed to virtuous conduct. ||30||
Meaning: Thus, the existence of the soul is established, therefore the Charvaka philosophy is to be rejected; because their pronouncements are sinful and opposed to virtuous conduct. ||30||
The Buddhists say that the soul is not eternal, but a series of moments of consciousness. This is not acceptable because the eternal nature of the soul is established by its actions. ||31||
Meaning: The Buddhists say that the soul is not eternal, but a series of moments of consciousness. This is not acceptable because the eternal nature of the soul is established by its actions. ||31|| 

Page #143:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** Buddhists say that the soul is a series of moments of knowledge, it is not eternal. If the soul is considered eternal, then neither sequential nor non-sequential actions can occur. ||31||

**Meaning:** If the soul is the cause of actions sequentially, then its eternal nature will be lost, and thus the soul will become impermanent. And if it is said that the soul acts non-sequentially, then all actions should happen simultaneously; but they do not. ||32||

**Meaning:** There is no fault in considering the soul to be momentary. It takes on new forms. The form that exists in the present moment, while performing its act of creation, is not flawed by momentariness due to the characteristic of being "doing" - a special characteristic. Rather, it is a great virtue that eliminates the craving that arises from seeing the soul as eternal. ||33||

**Meaning:** This view, which considers the soul to be momentary, is certainly not conducive to the growth of falsehood. It is because the soul, being momentary, does not suffer any loss, nor does it gain anything. ||34||

**Chapter Thirteen**
**143** 

Page #144:
---------------------------
_ **Meaning:** Certainly, this Buddhist philosophy is conducive to falsehood (mithyatva) because considering the soul as momentary leads to the destruction of actions performed and the fault of acquiring actions not performed. ||34||

**Meaning:** Due to the absence of the unity of one soul-substance, there will be no transmission of vasana (latent tendencies). Because the sequence of objects is always and everywhere highly relevant. ||35||

**Meaning:** By assuming a soul with specific characteristics of action, there will be no auspicious or inauspicious activity, no inference, and due to uncertainty, there will be no direct evidence. In this regard, the theorist, motivating the momentaryist, has said as follows: ||36||

**Meaning:** Without the specific qualifier of "vijatya" (heterogeneous) in that soul with specific characteristics of action, there will be no recollection of past experiences. 

Page #145:
---------------------------
It will not be possible without that remembrance. And without that remembrance, the realization of the Kurvadrupa, i.e., certainty, will not be possible, and without certainty, there will be no direct evidence. ||37|| The recognition of unity contradicts momentariness. Because in recognition, there is a certainty that 'I remember what I experienced before'. ||38|| There is no obstacle to the object in the eternal (permanent) one soul. Because, just as in Buddhism, there is no defect of unity in relating various types of knowledge to the momentary soul, similarly, there is no defect in relating various types of many moments to the stable soul. ||39|| It contradicts the nature of doing various actions together. And by establishing the Svadvada, there is no contradiction in the action of the eternal soul. ||40||

How can the Buddhists speak of the powers of non-differentiation (atabheda) in blue, black, etc., without accepting the existence of multiple natures (anekasvabhava)? ||41||

**Meaning:** Without accepting the existence of multiple natures, how can the Buddhists speak of the powers of non-differentiation in blue, black, etc.? ||41||

Even in the constant perception (dhruvekshana), love is not rejected due to the absence of disturbance (anupaplava). Like the perceived form (grahyakar), there is no quality in his knowledge in this Buddhist view. ||42||

**Meaning:** Even in the constant perception of the soul, the omniscient one did not reject love due to the absence of disturbance. Therefore, in this Buddhist view, there is no quality in his knowledge, like the perceived form. ||42||

On the contrary, if one accepts the impermanent nature (anityabhava), then the intellect of momentary birth (kshanajanurdhiya) will arise spontaneously. Due to disregard for the cause (hetu), all actions will become futile. ||43||

**Meaning:** On the contrary, if one accepts the impermanent nature, then the intellect of momentary birth will arise spontaneously. Due to disregard for the cause, all actions will become futile. ||43||

Therefore, this impermanent (kshanikavadi) view should be abandoned by those who desire the association of the eternal, true, conscious, and blissful state (nityasatyachidanandapad). ||44||

Neither the doer, nor the enjoyer, is the soul, as the Kapilas declare. This is not the refuge of the dharma of the generated (maya), but the nature that is the result. ||45||

**Meaning:** In the Sankhya philosophy, the soul is neither the doer nor the enjoyer, and the soul is not the refuge of the dharma of the generated (maya), but the refuge is the nature that is the result (maya). ||45||

The first result of this is the intellect, endowed with the eight qualities. From that, in succession, arise ego, the five subtle elements, the five senses, and the five gross elements. ||46||

**Meaning:** The intellect, endowed with the eight qualities, is the first result of this nature. And from that intellect, in succession, arise ego, the five subtle elements, the five senses, and the five gross elements. ||46||

The conscious being, in the form of consciousness, is the proof for the perfection of the intellect, and the conscious being, in the form of consciousness, is endowed with the rule of limitation. Otherwise, its perfection is not the object. ||47||

**Meaning:** The conscious being, in the form of consciousness, is the proof for the perfection of the intellect, and the conscious being, in the form of consciousness, is endowed with the rule of limitation. Otherwise, its perfection is not the object. ||47||

Because of the nature of the male, the nature, the object, and the senses, there is complete liberation. The division of the seen and the unseen, and the separation, are not appropriate. ||48||

**Meaning:** Because of the nature of the male, the nature, the object, and the senses, there is complete liberation. The division of the seen and the unseen, and the separation, are not appropriate. ||48||

The division of Adrishta, and Vyāsanga, will not be rational (occurred) in any way. ||48||  In a dream, due to the conception of a tiger etc., and the lack of pride in being a human, Ahamkara is conceived as having a definite function. ||49||
Meaning: In a dream, like the conception of a tiger etc., due to the lack of pride (ignorance) in being a human, Ahamkara is conceived as having a definite function. ||49|| From that Ahamkara, the sequence of Tanmātra etc. is for the origin of the universe. Thus, the intellect is the cause of the universe, but the Purusha (soul) is not subject to modifications. ||50||
Meaning: From that Ahamkara, the sequence of Tanmātra etc. is for the origin of the universe. Thus, the intellect is the cause of the universe, but the Purusha (soul) is not subject to modifications. ||50||  Purushārtha and Upārāga are the two agents in initiating all these activities (tendencies), and the involvement. Therefore, the Jīvātmā has the intellect that says, "I know the object, therefore I do it." Thus, the soul is the doer due to two types of indecision in the intellect. But this is not true. ||51||

Page #149:
---------------------------
Chetanāham karomi iti buddher bhedāgrahāt smayah | Etan nāśe'navacchinnam chaitanyaṁ mokṣa iṣyate || 52 ||

**Meaning:** Laughter arises from the intellect's misconception of oneness with the soul, thinking, "I am conscious, I am the soul, I do all this." When this ego is destroyed, the uninterrupted consciousness remains, and that is called liberation. || 52 ||

Kartṛbuddhigate duḥkha sukhe puṁsy upacāratah | Narānāthe yathābhṛtyagatau jayaparājayaū || 53 ||

**Meaning:** Just as the king experiences the victory and defeat of his servant, similarly, the soul (puruṣa) experiences the happiness and sorrow of the intellect, which is the doer. || 53 ||

Kartā bhoktā ca no tasmād ātmā nityo niranjanah | Adhyātasādanyathābuddhis tathācoktan mahātmanā || 54 ||

**Meaning:** Therefore, the soul is neither the doer nor the enjoyer, and it is eternal and pure. But due to adhyāsa (superimposition), the individual experiences false knowledge about the soul. Thus, the great sage Kapila has said. || 54 ||

Prakṛteḥ kriyamānāni guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvathā | Ahamkāra vimūḍhātma karttā'ham iti manyate || 55 ||

**Meaning:** All actions are performed by the qualities of nature. The soul, deluded by ego, thinks, "I am the doer." || 55 || 

Page #150:
---------------------------
##  Meaning:

**55.**  In reality, the qualities of nature perform actions; yet, the deluded soul, blinded by ego, believes, "I am the doer."

**56.**  Upon reflection, this view is not beautiful either.  For, the intellect and consciousness (purusha) share the same substratum, making its ugliness evident.

**57.**  You have declared the intellect to be the doer and the enjoyer.  If that intellect is eternal, there will be no liberation; and if it is non-eternal, there will be no samsara, because before the intellect's origin, there is no connection with dharma, etc.

**58.**  If we accept dharma, etc., as belonging to nature, then what will we call the intellect?  And then, the statement of the connection of such dharma, etc., will also naturally apply to pots, etc. 

Page #151:
---------------------------
If **karma** and **bhoga** are only of the **buddhi**, then **bandha** and **moksha** do not occur in the **atman**. And if that is the case, then everything that Kapila and others have said about the **atman** is in vain. ||59||

**Bhavartha:** If **karma** and **bhoga** are only of the **buddhi**, then **bandha** and **moksha** do not occur in the **atman**. And if that is the case, then everything that Kapila and others have said about the **atman** is in vain. ||59||

The knower of the twenty-five **tattvas**, whether he is a **jati**, a **mundi**, or a **shikhi**, is liberated from the bonds of **samsara**, regardless of the **ashrama** he is in. ||60||

**Bhavartha:** The knower of the twenty-five **tattvas**, whether he is a **jati**, a **mundi**, or a **shikhi**, is liberated from the bonds of **samsara**, regardless of the **ashrama** he is in. ||60||

If **bandha** and **moksha** are only **upacara** in the **atman**, then the entire **moksha**-proclaiming scripture is in vain. For who would act for the liberation of another? ||61||

**Bhavartha:** If **bandha** and **moksha** are only **upacara** in the **atman**, then the entire **moksha**-proclaiming scripture is in vain. For who would act for the liberation of another? ||61||

Therefore, it is not appropriate to have faith in the **Samkhya** doctrine of Kapila and others, because in that doctrine, the experienced **karta** and **bhokta** are eliminated. ||62||

**Bhavartha:** Therefore, it is not appropriate to have faith in the **Samkhya** doctrine of Kapila and others, because in that doctrine, the experienced **karta** and **bhokta** are eliminated. ||62||

Chapter Thirteen

Page #152:
---------------------------
"There is no liberation," some liberationists say, "because the soul is not bound." This is because the soul is bound by karma, either before, after, or simultaneously. (63)

**Meaning:** Some liberationists argue that liberation is impossible because the soul is not bound. However, this is incorrect because the soul is bound by karma, which can occur before, after, or simultaneously with the soul's existence.

If the relationship between the soul and karma is considered eternal, then the soul and karma would be eternally bound, just like the relationship between the soul and space. This would make liberation impossible. (64)

**Meaning:** If the relationship between the soul and karma is considered eternal, then the soul and karma would be eternally bound, just like the relationship between the soul and space. This would make liberation impossible.

This view (of the liberationists) is completely illogical because the relationship between the body and karma is like the relationship between a seed and a sprout. They are both part of a continuous chain of cause and effect, and their relationship is not eternal. (65)

**Meaning:** The view of the liberationists is illogical because the relationship between the body and karma is not eternal. It is like the relationship between a seed and a sprout, where one is the cause and the other is the effect. They are both part of a continuous chain of cause and effect.

The soul is the doer, the body is the instrument, and karma is the action. The soul experiences the fruits of its actions, just like a pot with a handle experiences the weight of the handle. (66)

**Meaning:** The soul is the doer, the body is the instrument, and karma is the action. The soul experiences the fruits of its actions, just like a pot with a handle experiences the weight of the handle. 

Page #153:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** The doer, the soul, is the doer only when it is associated with karma and resides in the body. And it is the doer of karma only when it is associated with the body. Just as a potter, associated with a stick, is the maker of a pot, similarly, the soul, associated with the body and karma, is the enjoyer of the fruits of its actions. ||66||

**Meaning:** Just like the seed and sprout, the hen and the egg, and gold and its impurities, the endless lineage (traditional relationship) of the soul and karma is destroyed. ||67||

**Meaning:** This arrangement should be known in relation to the liberated souls. For the unliberated souls, the relationship between the soul and karma is endless and without beginning, like the union of the soul and space. ||68||

**Meaning:** Just as the nature of substance is the same in all substances, yet there is a difference between the living and the non-living, similarly, although the nature of the soul is the same, there is a difference between the liberated and the unliberated. ||69|| 

Page #154:
---------------------------
##  Chapter 154, Adhyatma Sara

**69.**  
Even though **Jivattva** (life principle) is the same in all beings, whether **Bhavyas** (liberated souls) or **Abhavyas** (non-liberated souls), there is a distinction between **Bhavyatva** (liberation) and **Abhavyatva** (non-liberation).

**70.** 
**Bhavyatva** is natural, like the absence of a pot. There is no contradiction in its destruction due to the presence of causes of destruction.

**70. Meaning:** Just as the absence of a pot is natural, the destruction of **Bhavyatva** is also natural due to the presence of causes of destruction.

**71.** 
The destruction of **Bhavyas** is not like the destruction of the regions of space, because they are infinitely large. Just as a piece of stone is capable of becoming a statue, even in the absence of the desired result, **Bhavyas** are always capable of attaining liberation.

**71. Meaning:**  Just as the regions of space are infinitely large and cannot be destroyed, **Bhavyas** are also infinitely large and cannot be destroyed. Even if liberation is not achieved, **Bhavyas** are always capable of attaining it, just as a piece of stone is always capable of becoming a statue.

**72.** 
We do not say that all **Bhavyas** attain liberation. But we do say that those who attain liberation are definitely **Bhavyas**.

**72. Meaning:** We do not claim that all **Bhavyas** attain liberation. However, we do assert that those who attain liberation are definitely **Bhavyas**. 

Page #155:
---------------------------
"Is it not the case that even in liberation, the state of existence is perishable, since it is born?  No, for liberation is not like destruction, it is imperishable." (73)

"Just as the sky does not increase when a pot is broken by a hammer, so too the soul does not increase when karma is destroyed by knowledge." (74)

"It is not proper to doubt that a liberated soul, even though it is connected with karma-particles, is not liberated, because the yogas, which are the causes of bondage, cannot be reborn." (75)

"Liberation is achieved without fear, because it is the infinite knowledge of bliss, even though there may be a difference in the intensity of bliss." (76) 

Page #156:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** Due to the gradation (difference in degree) of happiness, there is also the possibility of supreme happiness. Therefore, it is proven that the one who has the knowledge of infinite happiness is fearless liberation. ||76||

**Meaning:** Therefore, the words of those who deny the existence of liberation, who are deluded and like atheists, should not be respected at all by the seeker of truth. ||77||

**Meaning:** Some others, similar to atheists, say that "there is no way to liberation." They accept the effect but not the cause; this is their great irony. ||78||

**Meaning:** Liberation is obtained suddenly because the period of liberation is fixed. This statement of theirs is also false. Because the fixed nature of the period is rarely seen. Even the logician says this in the following way. ||79|| 

Page #157:
---------------------------
Hetubhutanishedho na svanupakyavidhi na cha. Svabhavarnanana naivam avadherniyatatvatah ||80||
**Meaning:** Mokshavadhi is definite, therefore there is no prohibition of material that is the cause, nor is there a rule for the prohibition of the soul. Because of this, the description of the nature does not arise. ||80||
Na cha sarvatriko moksha sansarasyaapi darshanat. Na chanidam na tadvyakti vyanjako hetureva yat ||81||
**Meaning:** Samsara is visible, therefore moksha is not universal, and it should not be said that there is no clarity (expression) of that moksha at present. Because the cause = means that reveals moksha is there. ||81||
Mokshopayo'stu kintvasya nischayo neti chenmatam. Tan na ratnatrayasyaiva tathabhavavinischayata ||82||
**Meaning:** Even if there is a means to moksha, but there is no definite (specific) certainty of the means, if this is your opinion, then it is not true; because the Ratnatraya are definitely the means to moksha. ||82||
Bhavakaranaragadi pratipakshamadah khalu. Tadvipakshasya mokshasya karanam ghatate taram ||83||
**Meaning:** Attachment, etc., which are the causes of existence, are indeed the opposite. The opposite of that, moksha, becomes the cause. ||83||
Adhikar Terahvaan
157 

Page #158:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** These three jewels (the means to liberation) are the enemies of the causes of the world (like attachment, aversion, etc.). Therefore, these three jewels are the causes of liberation, which is the enemy of the world. This seems to be the logical conclusion. ||83||

**Meaning:** Just as the lightness of karma can be achieved through other means before attaining the three jewels, similarly, liberation can also be achieved through other means. So why should we rely only on the three jewels? ||84||

**Meaning:** Previous service (etc.) cannot be the means to liberation because it is weak. Therefore, it cannot be the action of liberation. For liberation, the strong action of right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct is the only suitable and capable means. ||85||

**Meaning:** Due to the potential for liberation or the lightness of karma, the qualities manifest very intensely. So why do you reject the expectation of them? ||86||

**Adhyatma Sara** 

Page #159:
---------------------------
And from the objection of the **Tathavyas**, the qualities like **virya**, **utsaha**, etc., are not the causes of liberation. This is not our opinion. But just as the stick, wheel, string, and rotation are mutually cooperative causes in the making of a pot, similarly, **Tathavyatva**, etc., are mutually cooperative causes in the attainment of liberation. ||87||

The means for the destruction of the world are **jnana**, **darshan**, and **charitra**. Therefore, the statement that negates this is to be rejected, as it increases **mithyatva**. ||88||

Therefore, a person with excellent intellect should abandon these places of **mithyatva** and contemplate the six places of **samyaktva** in the opposite way. He should imbue himself with these **bhavy** feelings. ||89||

|| Thus ends the chapter on the abandonment of **mithyatva**. ||

**[Renunciation of Attachment]**

They describe the renunciation of false attachment as the renunciation of false grasping, which is like a cloud for the fire of falsehood. Therefore, wise people with pure intentions and who understand the essence of the scriptures should be interested in this renunciation of attachment. ||1||

**Meaning:** False grasping (false attachment) is said to be like a cloud for the fire of falsehood. Therefore, wise people with pure intentions and who understand the essence of the scriptures should be interested in this renunciation of attachment. ||1||

The fire of false grasping burns within. Where can the vine of true knowledge grow there? Seek the flowers of peace and the fruits of good advice elsewhere. ||2||

**Meaning:** The fire of false grasping burns within. Where can the vine of true knowledge grow there? Seek the flowers of peace and the fruits of good advice elsewhere. ||2||

Those who consider themselves wise after reading a little and hearing a little from the scriptures, due to their attachment, may have their mouths kissed by pleasant words, but they have not understood the secret of the scriptures. ||3||

**Meaning:** Those who consider themselves wise after reading a little and hearing a little from the scriptures, due to their attachment, may have their mouths kissed by pleasant words, but they have not understood the secret of the scriptures. ||3|| 

Page #161:
---------------------------
They have kissed the mouth of speech, but they have not understood the secret of the play of speech; this should be understood. || 3 ||

Those who are blinded by a fragment of knowledge, whose ego is inflated due to their attachment to non-truth, and who have deluded the simple-minded, alas, these dull-witted people have ridiculed the beings of the three worlds with their itching for pedantic quibbling. || 4 ||

Where the moon of discrimination is not seen, where the sun of true knowledge is set, where the heart is shrouded in deep darkness, there is only the play of the new moon, the non-truth, which is like the dark fortnight. || 5 ||

A man whose mind is covered by non-truth, cuts the vine of truth with the sickle of false reasoning, waters the tree of faults with the sap of attachment, and throws down the sweet fruit of knowledge. || 6 || 

Page #162:
---------------------------
It nourishes the tree of vices with its juice, and throws down sweet and delicious fruits called equality. ||6|| In a mind filled with the poison of non-acceptance, the juice of good conduct can never enter. How can the seed of pure knowledge sprout in such a hardened mind? What is the fault of the teachings of the principles? ||7|| The vows are worn out, the austerities are performed, and the purity of the body is achieved with effort. But the fruits are not obtained by the non-acceptors; indeed, their stubbornness is the fault. ||8|| The plate is one's own intellect, and it is filled with an extraordinary amount of sweets from the giver, the good teacher. But a wicked non-acceptor grabs it by the throat and does not allow it to be enjoyed. ||9|| 162
Adhyatma Sara 

Page #163:
---------------------------
**Verse 10:**

The one who is not receptive to the meaning given by the Guru as a blessing, what is the fault of the Guru?  Just as a camel, who eats thorns, will not eat grapes even when they are placed before him, so too, the fault lies not with the Guru.

**Verse 11:**

Those who, due to their lack of receptivity, associate with the common people, do not have any affection for the wise. Just as crows, who are nourished by eating excrement, will not be interested in eating sweet food, no matter how much they are forced.

**Verse 12:**

The person who, due to his lack of receptivity, does not apply his intellect to the right (scriptural) reasoning, but instead forces reasoning into his own preconceived notions, is like someone who places a pot to collect water from a mirage. He becomes the object of ridicule for everyone.

**Chapter Fourteen**

**Page 163** 

Page #164:
---------------------------
**Verse 13:**

*Asadgraha* (non-acceptance of truth) is not destroyed in one who has it, nor is the knowledge given to him considered fruitful. The royal fortune of the wise does not bestow itself upon one who is stained with the blemish of *vaikalya* (mental disturbance).

**Verse 14:**

Just as water kept in an earthen pot, due to its inherent weakness, destroys both itself and the pot immediately, similarly, giving knowledge to one whose mind is afflicted with *asadgraha* (non-acceptance of truth) leads to the destruction of both the knowledge and the person holding the *asadgraha*.

**Verse 15:**

The foolish person who gives good advice to one whose mind is afflicted with *asadgraha* (non-acceptance of truth) is like someone who applies musk to a dog's body, thinking they are doing a great favor.

**Verse 16:**

One who gives the profound meaning of the scriptures to someone who is tainted by *asadgraha* (non-acceptance of truth), obtained with great effort, is like someone who sows seeds in barren land, knowing that their efforts will be in vain. 

Page #165:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** The seeker who gives the meaning of the pure (clear or detailed) Agamas, obtained with great difficulty, to a person contaminated by prejudice, later feels regret in the same way as one who sows seeds obtained after hundreds of efforts in a barren field. ||16||

**Meaning:** A person with prejudice never listens to the scriptures from the Guru, nor does he ever follow their commands. He, like a sieve, only accepts the worthless (useless chaff to be thrown away) and considers himself a scholar (interpreter) on this earth. ||17||

**Meaning:** It is amazing how the qualities of a person with prejudice are created in reverse! His cleverness is for arrogance, his study of scriptures is for sin, his brilliance is for deceiving others, and his patience is for pride. ||18||

**Meaning:** A person with prejudice, surrounded by those who are friendly and compassionate, suffers the same way as a banana tree, which is full of thorns and sharp prickles. ||19||

**Chapter Fourteen**
**165** 

Page #166:
---------------------------
**Verse 19:**

**Meaning:** One who befriends a man in the state of *kadagrah* (attachment) suffers all around, just as a banana tree (kadali-vriksha) suffers from millions of thorns when bad trees grow and break near it.

**Verse 20:**

**Meaning:** Due to *asadgraha* (attachment), qualities like knowledge (vidya), discernment (viveka), purity (vishuddhi), love for principles (siddhant-vallabhya), and generosity (udaratā) are destroyed just as grass is destroyed by a spark from a fire. Just as a pile of grass is completely burnt by a single spark from a fire, similarly, *kadagrah* destroys all the beneficial qualities like the study of scriptures (vidya), reflection on right and wrong actions (viveka), humility (vinaya), purity of food and other things (vishuddhi), love for scriptures and principles, and generosity. Therefore, one should stay away from *kadagrah* or those who are attached.

**Verse 21:**

**Meaning:** A person in *kadagrah* finds his own self-interest (swartha) dear, not virtuous qualities. His friendship is with fools, not with wise men. This is the state of those who are exhausted by the suffering caused by *asadgraha*, who are careless and of the lowest kind. 

Page #167:
---------------------------
Moreover, it is not the same with those who know the truth. Those who have given rest to their minds in attachment, or attachment has taken rest in them, or who have become exhausted or disturbed due to attachment, the state of such low-minded men is like this. ||21||

Knowing this truth, the noble-minded man who abandons false attachment like a straw, he is not abandoned by fame and fortune, who are attached to his qualities, just as a virtuous woman, attached to her husband's qualities, does not abandon him. The word 'Yasha' in the verse indicates the author's name 'Yashavijaya'. ||22||

|| Thus ends the chapter on the abandonment of false attachment. ||

[Nature of Yoga]

**1.** The yoga of the **Samyaktvashali**, the purifier of the **adhyatma**, becomes manifest when the **asadgraha** is eradicated, and he has vomited out the **mithyatva-visha-bindu**.

**Meaning:** When the **duraggraha** is destroyed, and the **mithyatva-visha-bindu** (poisonous drops of false belief) are vomited out, the yoga of the **Samyaktvashali**, the purifier of the **adhyatma**, becomes established.

**2.** This yoga is of two kinds, based on the difference between **karma** and **jnana**. The first, **karma-yoga**, is described as the form of action prescribed by the **avashyaka** and other **vidhi-vidhana**.

**Meaning:** This yoga is of two types, based on the difference between **karma** and **jnana**. The first, **karma-yoga**, is described as the form of action prescribed by the **avashyaka** and other **vidhi-vidhana**.

**3.** This **karma-yoga**, which is the very essence of the body's movements, performs actions that are auspicious in nature, with love and affection born from **sadraga**. Therefore, it is called **karma-yoga**.

**Meaning:** Since this **karma-yoga**, which is the very essence of the body's movements, performs actions that are auspicious in nature, with love and affection born from **sadraga**, therefore, it is called **karma-yoga**.

Due to attachment to necessities and affection for the Bhagavat's words (through Karmayoga), the seeker attains the pleasures of heaven, but does not reach the ultimate state (Moksha). ||4||

**Meaning:**  A seeker who is attached to necessities and has affection for the Bhagavat's words (through Karmayoga) attains the pleasures of heaven, but does not reach the ultimate state (Moksha). ||4||

Knowledge Yoga is characterized by pure austerity and single-minded devotion to the Self. It is the means to attain the bliss of liberation, arising from the detachment from the objects of the senses. ||5||

**Meaning:** When there is only love (interest or faith) in the Self, and detachment from the objects of the senses arises, then there is pure austerity, and that is Knowledge Yoga, which is the means to attain the bliss of liberation. ||5||

In this Knowledge Yoga, there is only knowledge (awareness) of the Self, therefore there is no restriction from others (par), because even good karma (action) does not cause distraction (disturbance of self-meditation) in Knowledge Yoga. ||6||

**Meaning:** In this Knowledge Yoga, there is only knowledge (awareness) of the Self, therefore there is no restriction from others (par), because even good karma (action) does not cause distraction (disturbance of self-meditation) in Knowledge Yoga. ||6||

For the unmindful, even actions related to necessities are not considered as distractions, because their mind is always focused on the Self, as stated by others. ||7||

**Meaning:** For the unmindful, even actions related to necessities are not considered as distractions, because their mind is always focused on the Self, as stated by others. ||7|| 

Page #170:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** For the vigilant Sadhus, even the essential actions are not to be performed regularly (they are not bound by them); because they are pure by virtue of their mindfulness. This has also been said by others in the following way: ||7||

**Meaning:** The person who finds joy in the Self, who is satisfied in the Self, and who is content in the Self, has no duty to perform. ||8||

**Meaning:** Because in this world, there is no purpose in that man's doing or not doing anything. He has no attachment to any self-interest towards all beings. ||9||

**Meaning:** In this Jnana Yoga, even disinterest and joy are forbidden. Because of the stability of the mind in meditation, how can there be any choice (imagination) of actions? ||10||

Page #171:
---------------------------
Dehanirvahamaatraartha yaapi bhikṣāṭanādhika | Kriyā sā jñānino'sangaannaiva dhyānavighatini || 11 ||
**Meaning:** Even though a Jñani engages in activities like begging for sustenance, these actions do not disrupt his meditation due to his non-attachment (asanga). || 11 ||

Ratnaśikṣā haganyā hi tanniyojanadṛgyathā | Phalabhedātta thācāriyakriyā'pyasya vibhiddyate || 12 ||
**Meaning:** Just as the vision of a person learning to examine gems is different from the vision of a person examining gems, the actions of a Jñani are also different due to the difference in their fruits. || 12 ||

Dhyānārthā hi kriyā seyaṁ pratyāhritya nijam manaḥ | Prārabdhajanmasankalpādātmajñānāya kalpate || 13 ||
**Meaning:** Therefore, this action, performed for the sake of meditation, is capable of leading to self-knowledge when the mind is withdrawn from the karmic impulses of the present life. || 13 ||

Sthīribhūtamapi svāntaṁ rajasā calatāṁ vrajet | Pratyāhritya nigṛhyati jñānī yadi damuchyate || 14 ||
**Meaning:** Even though the mind is settled, it can be agitated by the impurities (rajas). The Jñani withdraws and controls it, as it is said. || 14 ||

**Adhikāra 15th**
**171** 

Page #172:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** Even if the mind is still, it becomes restless due to Rajoguna (attachment). Therefore, the wise person pulls it back and controls it, which is further explained in the following verse. ||14||

**Meaning:** Gradually attain calmness (peace) with the help of a mind controlled by fortitude (steadiness or contentment). Then, by placing the mind in the Self, there is no need to think about anything else. ||15||

**Meaning:** Wherever the restless and unstable mind wanders, restrain it from there and bring it under the control of the Self. These two verses from the Gita explain the methods of concentrating the mind. In this way, the yogi, while moving from one subject to another, gradually controls the fickle mind (which has the nature of grasping other subjects) by restraining it from the distractions (thoughts) that arise and by binding it with the rope of knowledge. 

Page #173:
---------------------------
He makes it steady and makes it subject to the soul (immersed in it) ||16||
Therefore, the great-minded one should perform the actions prescribed by the scriptures with a firm mind. For the complete withdrawal of the senses ||17||
Meaning: Therefore, the great-minded man whose mind is not firm, should perform all the actions prescribed by the scriptures to withdraw the mind from the objects ||17||
Having heard the story of the Pisacha (ghost) and the protection of the family bride, the ascetic should always be immersed in the practices of restraint ||18||
Meaning: Having heard the story of the Pisacha (ghost) and the protection of the family bride, the ascetic should always be immersed in the practices of restraint. The said two stories are as follows - ||18|| Or, the actions of those who are only in determination are not very useful. Those same actions are very beneficial for those who are in the state of practice ||19||
Meaning: The actions that are not very useful for the ascetics who are only immersed in determination, are the very actions that are very beneficial for the practitioners who are in the state of practice ||19|| Even for pure karma, due to the practice of faith, meditation, etc. The imperishable nature of liberation is due to the knowledge yoga, not exceeding it ||20||
Chapter Fifteen
173 

Page #174:
---------------------------
Meaning: For one who performs pure actions through the combination of faith, clear intellect (nirmalbuddhi), etc., they become the cause of unblemished liberation, as they do not transgress the path of knowledge. Actions performed with complete knowledge and in accordance with the scriptures, combined with intense faith in the words of the Jinas, a mind capable of grasping subtle meanings, and the virtues of patience, concentration, and contemplation, etc., all contribute to the attainment of unblemished liberation. This is because these actions, such as kayotsarga, do not violate the path of knowledge, but rather become a part of it. They lead to the cessation of mental activity and the destruction of karma. ||20||

Meaning: During the practice of yoga, yogis require pure actions for purification of the mind. However, upon the maturity of knowledge, only tranquility (sama) is required, as stated by other schools of thought. ||21||

Meaning: For a muni who desires to ascend the path of yoga, actions are considered the cause. However, once the muni has attained yoga, tranquility becomes the cause. ||22|| 

Page #175:
---------------------------
For a Muni, **Sham** (equality) is called the cause. Yogis have said that for a Muni to be established in meditation and other yogas, and for the purification of the mind, the cause in the form of **Satkriya-karma** is necessary. But when the same seeker becomes established in yoga (attains meditation and other yogas), then he only needs **Sham**. Because only in the state of **Sham** does the state of being established in yoga remain stable. ||22||

When one is not attached to the objects of the senses and actions, then he is called a **Yogarudha** who has renounced all desires. ||23||

Knowledge without action is not knowledge, and action without knowledge is not action. But there is a difference in their state (condition) due to the predominance of one over the other. ||24||

Therefore, for those who are knowledgeable, have pure minds through **Karma Yoga**, and have impeccable conduct, **Jnana Yoga** is appropriate. ||25||

Nor is that karma, even in Yoga, free from the desire for fruit, or from the renunciation of Brahman knowledge, because it is inherently flawed. ||29||

It cannot be, because (both Yaga or Brahmabodha) are inherently
*savady* - sinful.

Nor would there be clear purification from *gohinsa* etc. if this were so. Or from the *syenayaga* prescribed by the Vedas, because there is no difference between them. ||30||
Meaning: If this were not the case, then there would be clear purification of the mind from *gohinsa* etc., or from the *syenayaga* prescribed by the Vedas; because there is no difference (distinction) between them. ||30||
Therefore, *savadyakarma* should not be accepted, because it leads to a distortion of the intellect. If, by chance, such *savadyakarma* is obtained due to the rise of karma, then it does not bind to sinful karma because there is no intention involved. ||31||
Meaning: This leads to a distortion of the intellect, therefore *savadyakarma* is not worthy of acceptance. If, by chance, such *savadyakarma* is obtained due to the rise of karma, then it does not bind to sinful karma because there is no intention involved. ||31||
Even if a knower performs karma, his liberation does not diminish; because bondage arises only from intention, as other philosophers have also said. ||32||

**Meaning:** A learned person, endowed with knowledge and humility, sees equality in all beings, be it a Brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog, or a Chandala. ||43|| Those whose minds are established in equality have conquered the world in this very life, because Brahman is faultless and equal. Therefore, they are established in Brahman, one should understand. ||44|| The knower of Brahman, established in Brahman, with a steady mind and free from delusion, does not rejoice upon obtaining something pleasant, nor does he become distressed upon obtaining something unpleasant. ||45|| In the earlier stages, seeing equality (samyadarśana) in inequality is a fault, whereas for the detached sages, the same samyadarśana is for the destruction of attachment and aversion. ||46|| Chapter Fifteen

He does not become attached one moment and detached the next, angry one moment and pleased the next; he never adopts such **bahurupata** (multiformity). Due to his purity, he opens the excellent (knowledge-like) eyes and closes the other physical eyes (eyes of ignorance). That is, he becomes so absorbed in meditation on the Self that his eyes of ignorance automatically close completely, ignorance itself flees. ||54||

He observes the inner feelings, attains **पूर्णभाव** (perfection), enjoys the kingdom of the Self, and does not see anything else remaining. ||55||

**Meaning:** And then he observes the objects that remain in his soul, attains **पूर्णभाव** (perfection), enjoys the kingdom of the Self, and does not see anything else remaining. ||55||

From the aspect of omniscience, all yogis are equal. The difference of distance, proximity, etc., does not destroy their servitude. 

Page #189:
---------------------------
A **Sarvज्ञsevaka** who is diligent in effort and has a strong interest in **Moksha** can attain **Moksha** quickly. However, a **Sarvज्ञsevaka** who is diligent in effort but has a weak interest in **Moksha** due to other views, and who practices **Vritti** control, **Indriyay** control, **Ashtaangayog**, etc., can attain **Moksha** only after a long time. This difference does not negate their devotion to the **Sarvज्ञ**, nor does it deny them the status of being a **Sarvज्ञ**'s servant. ||66||

It is through the reliance on **Maadhyasthya** that the service of the **Devata**'s greatness is desired by all wise people. Even the **Aachaarya** named **Kalaatiit** has said this. ||67||

The path of others, including **Muktavaadi**, **Avidyaavaadi**, etc., is also established by the same **Tattvaniiti**, only with a difference in name. ||68||

Due to the lack of knowledge of the specific form, the arguments of the caste-based philosophers are often contradictory, and due to the non-differentiation of the fruit in essence, there is a difference in the philosophies. ||71||
**Meaning:** Due to the lack of knowledge of the specific form of the arguments of the caste-based philosophers, there is often contradiction, and due to the non-differentiation of the fruit in essence, there is a difference in the philosophies. ||71||
Since ignorance, affliction, karma, etc., are the causes of existence (samsara), there is a difference in the designation of these causes. Therefore, the omniscient is also described in different philosophies due to the difference in designation.

The other distinction of this, which is also a pictorial attribute, is sung by the wise as being due to past causes, but it is also meaningless. ||73||

---------------------------
**Meaning:** This karma, which is also called by various names like Avidya, etc., is also useless for wise men. ||73|| Therefore, the attempt to describe its distinctions is inappropriate. Because the subject of inference is considered to be general. ||74||

**Meaning:** It is appropriate for a seeker with a concise interest to not rely on specifics, just as the knowledge of the grazing of the Chari Sanjeevani was appropriate in a general way. ||75||

**Meaning:** The inquiry of the righteous is also justified, because other (like Gita, etc.) philosophers also say the same thing, that the seeker of Yoga also transcends the word-Brahman. ||76||

There are four types of devotees: the distressed, the inquisitive, the seeker of worldly benefits, and the wise. Among these, three are blessed due to their specific nature. (This is mentioned in Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 7, Verse 16). The wise, however, is distinguished by his peaceful disposition, unwavering devotion, and constant inner connection with the Lord, being ever-loving. He, being the inner self, is very close to the Lord. The one purified by the path of action should engage his mind in the path of knowledge. But the ignorant, the faithless, and the doubtful perish. The fearless, steadfast, with unwavering gaze, seated comfortably, with a serene face, and not looking around, is the one who is truly devoted.

Meditation is the state of the mind focused on a single object for a moment.  A long and unbroken sequence of states, even if it involves multiple objects, is called a meditation series (Dhyana-santati). ||2||

The mental anguish arising from the association and separation with desirable objects, and the mental anguish arising from contemplating the cause (of suffering). Thus, there are four types of evil (sinful) mental anguish.

**Verse 6:**

In these four types of mental anguish, there is a possibility of the three Leshyas - Kapota, Neel, and Krishna - due to the results of karma that is not very intense.

**Verse 7:**

Wise ones have said that the signs of one who is in mental anguish are: crying, weeping, wailing loudly, lamenting, sobbing, beating (one's chest or head), and tearing (one's clothes).

* **Moghāṁ nindannījaṁ kṛtyaṁ, praśaṁsan para-sampadaḥ |**
* **Vismitaḥ prārthayannētāḥ prasaktaścaitad-arjane ||8||**

**Meaning:** One who condemns their own fruitless actions, praises the worldly wealth of others, is amazed and begs for those possessions, and becomes attached to acquiring them.  Such a person, even after putting forth their best efforts in their craft, trade, or other endeavors, finds themselves unsuccessful. They then criticize their own fruitless work, praise the wealth of others, and, filled with wonder, desire those possessions. They become intensely eager to obtain them by any means. Such a person should be considered an *ārtta-dhyānī*.

**Verse 9:**

* **Pramattaścendriyārtheṣu gṛddhaḥ dharmaparāṅmukaḥ |**
* **Jino-ktam-puraskurvan-nārtta-dhyāne pravarttate ||9||**

**Meaning:** A person who is heedless, greedy for sense objects, averse to Dharma, and does not accept the teachings of the Jinas, is prone to *ārtta-dhyāna*.

* **Pramattānta-guṇa-sthānānugametan-mahātmanā |**
* **Sarva-pramāda-mūlatvāt-tyājyaṁ tiryag-gati-pradam ||10||**

**Meaning:** Great souls should avoid following the path of the heedless, as it is the root of all heedlessness and leads to the path of the animals. 

Page #197:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** This **Ārttadhyāna** (meditation of distress), which is the root cause of all **pramada** (negligence) that leads to **tiryañc-gati** (animal rebirth) and persists until the **Pramattagunasthan** (stage of negligence), should be abandoned by the great souls. ||10||

**Meaning:** Thinking about killing, binding, etc., with extreme anger is called the first **Roudradhyāna** (meditation of anger).  And, to be deceitful, gossipy, rude, and to have a disposition to speak falsely is called the second **Roudradhyāna**.  The mind of a person who is devoid of expectations and is overwhelmed with intense anger, which leads to stealing, is called the third **Roudradhyāna**.  To have a mind polluted with suspicion towards everyone in relation to protecting wealth is called the fourth **Roudradhyāna**. ||11-12||

**Meaning:** This four-fold **Roudradhyāna** exists in beings up to the **Deśaviratigunasthan** (stage of detachment from the world), in the form of doing, causing to do, and approving of these actions that are full of faults. ||13||

Having many faults, having many kinds of faults, having the fault of killing, being inclined towards violence, etc., being happy after doing evil, being merciless, lack of remorse, and feeling pride when others are in trouble; these are the signs of fierce meditation. Therefore, wise men should abandon this fierce meditation, which gives rise to the suffering of hell. ||15-16||

## Translation:

**18. ** One should contemplate on the following: *bhavana* (meditation), *desa* (place), *kala* (time), *shubhasana* (auspicious posture), *alambana* (object of meditation), *anukrama* (sequence), *dhyatavya* (object to be meditated upon), *dhyata* (meditator), *anupreksha* (reflection), *leshya* (subtle body), *linga* (sign), and *phala* (fruit).

**19. ** Knowing these, one should engage in *dharma-dhyana* (meditation on Dharma). There are four *bhavanas* (meditations) in this context: *jnana* (knowledge), *darshan* (vision), *charitra* (conduct), and *vairagya* (dispassion).

**20. ** The fruits of these four *bhavanas* are: 1. *Nischalatva* (steadiness), 2. *Asammoha* (non-delusion), 3. *Purvakarma* (past karma) *nirjara* (exhaustion), 4. *Sanga* (attachment) *ashansa* (hope) and *bhaya* (fear) *uccheda* (destruction).

**21. ** One with a steady mind, through these *bhavanas*, attains the qualification for meditation. This qualification is not attainable by others. This has also been stated by other philosophers.

**22. ** O Krishna! The mind is fickle, restless, and strong. I consider its control as difficult as controlling the wind.

**Chapter 16**
**199** 

Page #200:
---------------------------
O mighty-armed one! The mind is indeed very difficult to control, like a strong army of enemies. But, O son of Kunti, it can be controlled by practice and detachment.  

It is my opinion that yoga is difficult to attain for one whose mind is not controlled. But, O Arjuna, for one whose mind is controlled, it can be attained by means of effort.

All this is appropriate for one whose mind is filled with contemplation, when, through repeated experiences of similar objects, one becomes free from desire for external objects.

A place free from women, animals, thieves, and wicked people should be sought out for meditation, especially during the time of meditation. This is always prescribed for the ascetics. 

Page #201:
---------------------------
## Meaning:

**Verse 26:** The _Agamas_ (Jain scriptures) command the _yatis_ (ascetics) to constantly reside in a place devoid of women, men, eunuchs, and _kushila_ (immoral, adulterous) individuals. This is especially emphasized during meditation.

**Verse 27:** For a _sthira-yogi_ (one who practices _sthira-yoga_), there is no distinction between a village, forest, or grove. The place where one's mind finds peace and is absorbed in meditation is considered suitable for the meditator.

**Verse 28:** The time when one achieves _yoga-samadhi_ (absorption in yoga) is the most auspicious time for meditation. For the meditator, there is no rule regarding day, night, moments, or hours.

**Verse 29:** The meditator should practice meditation in a posture that has been mastered and does not hinder meditation. They can meditate while sitting, standing, or lying down.

The state (stability of the body's elements) should be won (experienced with regard to the suitability of meditation familiarized by much practice), and should never destroy the commenced meditation, in that very state, the yogi should meditate - become absorbed in meditation - while sitting in Padmasana etc., standing in Kayotsarga etc., or sleeping on a bed of Darbha etc. ||29||

In all countries, times, and states, the Munis have attained Kevalgyan. Therefore, there is no rule for them regarding country, time, etc. There is a rule for the stability of yoga. ||30||

Reading, questioning, repetition, contemplation, action, right dharma, and essentials are the supports for this meditation. ||31||

One ascends to a difficult step with the support of a strong object. Similarly, one ascends to true meditation with the support of sutras etc. ||32|| 

Page #203:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** Just as a man with a firm substance (matter) as his support ascends to a difficult place, so too does a yogi, taking refuge in the support of the sutras, etc., ascend to the peak of true meditation. ||32||

**Meaning:** Due to the destruction of obstacles arising from the respect for the support, yogis do not fall while ascending the mountain of meditation. ||33||

**Meaning:** The sequence of attaining meditation, starting from the restraint of the mind, etc., has been described for the Kevala Jnani. For others, the appropriate solution (samadhi of mental concentration, etc.) has been described. ||34||

Page #205:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** Contemplating the Lokasthana (world structure) filled with diverse entities, differentiated by characteristics like production, expenditure, and Dhruva, and filled with names and distinctions, is the fourth Lokasthana-vijaya. || 39 ||

**Meaning:** In that Lokasthana, the soul itself is the doer, the enjoyer, formless, imperishable, and characterized by utility, such contemplation is also included in the Dharma-dhyana called Santhana-vichya. || 40 ||

Birth, old age, and death, caused by karma, are like a great whirlpool of delusion, fueled by the fire of desire, || 41 ||

Filled with the great fire of hope, overflowing with the pot of Kshaya, and agitated by the waves of false perceptions, || 42 ||

With a stream of desires flowing in the heart, a series of evils, a vine of prayers, and a stomach that is difficult to satisfy, || 43 ||

The darkness of ignorance, the fear arising from the lightning of calamities, and the shaking of the heart caused by the wind of greed, || 44 ||

The ocean of existence, filled with various diseases, fish, and turtles, and difficult to cross due to the moving mountains of faults, should be contemplated. || 45 ||

**205** 

Page #206:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** The belly (middle part) of this ocean of worldly pleasures is filled with the water of birth, old age, and death, which arises from the karmas of each and every being. It is adorned with the great whirlpool of attachment, terrifying like the fire of lust, filled with the great wind of desires (aspirations), and tossed about by the pitchers of passions. It bears the violent wave cycle of wrong views, and is insurmountable due to the increase of the stream of sensory desires (strong tides of desires for objects of senses like sound, etc.) in the heart. It has a lineage (offspring) of vines in the form of prayers, and is filled with sorrow. 

Where there is the dark day of ignorance, frightening due to the falling of lightning in the form of calamities, shaking the heart with the storm of the well-like wind, filled with various fish, turtles, etc. in the form of diseases, and is inaccessible due to the moving mountains of fickleness, emptiness, and pride, one should contemplate this ocean of the world. || 41-42-43-44-45 ||

The means of crossing it is the firm bond of right faith, adorned with many virtues and accompanied by the knowledge of liberation. || 46 ||

The leak of the inflow of karma is stopped by the practice of restraint, which is secret and guarded on all sides. The two shores of this ocean are the platform of conduct, illuminated by the lamp of right conduct, and the renunciation of blame. || 47 ||

This ocean is difficult to cross, with countless, insurmountable, and difficult-to-bear waves of desires. It is supported by the well of right effort, and its peak is adorned with the white cloth of the soul. || 48 ||

Thus, contemplate with single-pointed focus. || 46-47-48-49-50 ||

Just as in a play, when the curtain falls, there is a fear of the play ending, so too, in the play of existence, there is a fear of the end of the play. || 51 ||

When this one, like a tortoise, completely retracts all his limbs, his wisdom is established when he withdraws the senses from sense objects. ||67||
**Meaning:** Just as a tortoise retracts all its limbs, so too, when a yogi withdraws his senses from sense objects, his wisdom is steady. Understand this. ||67||
He becomes peaceful and subdued, dwelling in self-absorption, for the nature of a Siddha is the same as the qualification of a seeker. ||68||
**Meaning:** Thus, the yogi, dwelling in self-absorption, becomes peaceful and subdued, for the nature of a Siddha is the same as the qualification of a seeker. ||68||
This same, non-negligent seeker is the meditator of the two feet of the white meditation, provided he is a former holder, and the meditator of the other two feet are respectively the Sa-yogi Kevali and the A-yogi Kevali. ||69||
**Meaning:** This same non-negligent seeker is the meditator of the two feet of the white meditation, provided he is a former holder, and the meditator of the other two feet are respectively the Sa-yogi Kevali and the A-yogi Kevali. ||69||
Because of the impermanence, etc., even in the cessation of meditation, he should constantly contemplate the impermanence, etc., without delusion. These are the breaths of meditation. ||70||
**Meaning:** Because of the impermanence, etc., even in the cessation of meditation, the non-deluded muni should constantly contemplate the impermanence, etc. These are the breaths of meditation. ||70|| 

Page #213:
---------------------------

There are three final leshyas, characterized by intensity and other distinctions. Their signs are: faith in the Agamas, humility, and praise of the virtuous. || 71 ||

Meaning: For the yogi who practices the highest form of Dharma meditation, with virtue and restraint, the fruit is said to be the attainment of heaven, connected to mature merit. || 72 ||

One should meditate on the white (Shukla) with forgiveness, gentleness, straightforwardness, and liberation (non-attachment). The Muni, residing in the subtle body, should focus the mind on the atom. But the Kevali, free from attachment, should meditate on the white by restraining the mind. || 73 ||

With thought, with deliberation, with separateness, that is the beginning. There, the thought is the forerunner, relying on various things. || 74 ||

Chapter Sixteen
213 

Page #214:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** The first stage of white meditation, with vitarka, vicara, and prithaktva, is composed of three types. Of these three, vitarka is that which relies on various nayas and has knowledge of the past (past-heard). ||74||

**Meaning:** The mutual transition of artha, vyanjana, and yogas is called vicara. The mutual movement (transition) of dravya, paryaya, and guna is called prithaktva. ||75||

**Meaning:** For the sadhu yogi, this first white meditation, endowed with vitarka, etc., is like the calm state of a sea with slightly rippling waves. ||76||

**Meaning:** The second white meditation, with one paryaya, united with unity, vitarka, and vicara, is steady like a lamp placed in a windless space. ||77|| 

Page #215:
---------------------------
The third, called *Sūkṣmakriyānivṛtti*, is the *Jina*'s (Kevalajnāni's) *Śukladhyāna*, in which two *yogas* are completely stopped and one *yoga* is partially stopped. ||78||

The fourth, called *Samuccinnākriyāpratipāti*, is the *Śukladhyāna* of the *Śaileśī* state, which is born of the *Śailava* (mountain-like) *niṣpakampa* (unshakeable) *Viśvavedin* (omniscient). ||79||

These four types of *Śukladhyāna* have two fruits. The first two *Śukladhyānas* result in attaining the *Suraloka* (heavenly realm), and the last two *Śukladhyānas* result in *Mahōdaya* (liberation). ||80||

In the *Śuklavisrama* (state of white meditation), one should not see the *āśravāpāya* (influx and efflux), the *saṃsāra* (cycle of birth and death), the *anu-bhāva* (subtle impressions), the *bhavasantati* (succession of existences), or the change in meaning. ||81||

Authority: Sixteenth.
215 

Page #216:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** In the cessation of white meditation, he should continue to observe the suffering obtained from inflow, the nature of the world, the tradition of birth and death, and the result that occurs in matter, that is, he should continue to meditate on the same. ||81|| In the first two meditations, there is white leshya, in the third meditation called subtle action cessation, the supreme (bright) white leshya is considered; and the fourth aspect of white meditation has been declared by the Jinesvara Bhagavants as devoid of leshya. ||82|| The four signs of the white meditator who has pure yoga are said to be: avadha, asammoha, viveka, and vyutsarga. ||83|| Due to avadha, he does not tremble or fear from upsargas, due to asammoha, he does not get confused even in subtle matters and illusions. ||84|| Due to viveka, he sees himself as different from all connections, due to vyutsarga, the muni is born. ||85|| 

Page #217:
---------------------------
He is not deluded by Devmaya etc. Due to the third limb of Vivek, the Shukla-dhyani Muni sees his soul separate from all connections. And due to the Vyutsarga-rupa limb, he is detached (anasakt = nishpriha) from the body and equipment (materials). ||84-85|| And knowing the pure sequence of meditation, by the command of the Bhagavan, whoever practices this, becomes a knower of the complete spiritual knowledge. ||86||
Meaning: Thus, whoever practices this meditation, knowing the pure sequence of meditation according to the command of the Bhagavan, becomes a knower of the complete spiritual knowledge. ||86||
|| Thus ends the chapter on meditation ||

Meaning: When the seeker attains the highest state of maturity in dhyāna yoga, then the position of Indra also seems like a straw to him. Therefore, partake in that dhyāna which is self-illuminating, blissful, and destroyer of worldly illusions. ||1||
Āturairapi jaḍairapi sākṣāt sutyajā hi viṣayā na tu rāgaḥ | Dhyānavāṁstu paramadyutidarśī tṛptiṁ āpya na tamaṛcchati bhūyaḥ ||2||

Page #219:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** For all beings, night is a festival related to the day for the meditator. And in which they (beings) remain awake with attachment (insistence), in that the meditating man sleeps. ||3||

**Meaning:** Just as the perfection (attainment) of the water in the well is from the source of water (spring), so the perfection of the fruits of all actions is from the flow of meditation (high and continuous meditation). Therefore, meditation is the root cause of the ultimate goal. ||4||

**Meaning:** The meditator, deeply absorbed in the soul, is not bound (constrained) by the mental afflictions arising from passions, by the mental afflictions arising from the salutations of kings, Indra, etc., by the most undesirable objects, and by sorrows. ||5||

**Meaning:** May meditation, which is filled with clearly seen happiness and is superior to the happiness of liberation, be my favorite. If this is not the case, then the atheist is killed by the punishment of the divine word. ||6|| 

Page #220:
---------------------------
If the non-believer is not destroyed by the blow of the weapon of Nay's literature (scripture), then what happened to him? ||6|| Where there is no space for the light of the sun, moon, stars, and lamps to spread, even that secret is revealed to the sages who have attained the light of the soul by meditation, which has dispelled the darkness of ignorance. ||7|| This meditation is our friend, which quickly unites the beloved Shamrati, who has been separated for a long time. So what do we care about artificial friends in the world? ||8|| The soul finds happiness in the fire of meditation, which is seated on the bed of peace in the high palace, where the heat of the sun of lust is stopped, and where the cool fragrance of virtue is spreading. ||9|| 

Page #221:
---------------------------
**Verse 10:**

In the palace of meditation, the self, the pure and supreme guest, is honored with a seat of virtue, a foot-washing water of self-control, an offering of knowledge, and a sweet drink of equanimity.

**Meaning:** In the state of meditation, the self, which is inherently pure and the ultimate guest, is worshipped with virtue as the seat, self-control as the foot-washing water, knowledge as the offering, and equanimity as the sweet drink.

**Verse 11:**

The dispute arising from the perception of difference between the self and the Supreme Self is instantly eradicated by the mediator of meditation, spreading the oneness of both.

**Meaning:** The conflict caused by the belief in a separation between the self and the Supreme Self is swiftly eliminated by the unifying power of meditation, revealing the inherent unity of both.

**Verse 12:**

Where is nectar in the serpent realm filled with poison? Where is it in the waning moon, or even in heaven? Where is it among the gods who are infatuated with celestial nymphs? This nectar, fit for the wise, is found only in meditation.

**Meaning:** Where can nectar be found in the serpent realm filled with poison? Where is it in the waning moon, or even in heaven? Where is it among the gods who are infatuated with celestial nymphs? This nectar, fit for the wise, is found only in meditation.

**Verse 13:**

Neither in the flesh of animals, nor in sugar, nor in the moon, nor in the face of a woman, does one find that taste. Only the wise, who are established in the state of meditation, know that taste.

**Meaning:** The true taste is not found in the flesh of animals, nor in sugar, nor in the moon, nor in the face of a woman. Only the wise, who are established in the state of meditation, know that taste. 

Page #222:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** Neither in grapes, nor in sugar, nor in nectar, nor in the lips of a beautiful woman, is that divine taste found. Only a wise man knows that taste, for it is manifest in the patience (contentment) born of meditation. ||13||

223 

Page #224:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** The non-duality of the soul (Atma) and non-soul (Anatma) has been heard, experienced, and introduced, but only a rare individual knows its distinction through nature or instruction. ||4||

**Meaning:** Therefore, self-knowledge (Atma-jnana) is beneficial by considering oneness (Ekattva) and separateness (Prithaktva). But the contrary intellect of those who are attached to the external is false, futile, and hypocritical. ||5||

**Meaning:** There is only one soul (Atma) which resides in its own nature, and it is described as having the characteristics of knowledge (Jnana), vision (Darshan), and conduct (Charitra). ||6||

**Meaning:** Just as the brilliance, purity, and power of a gem are not separate from the gem, so too are the characteristics of knowledge, vision, and conduct not separate from the soul. ||7||

**Meaning:** The difference in the characteristics of the soul is due to convention (Vyavahar), which is perceived through the use of words like "six" (Shastyaadi), but not through certainty (Nischya). ||8|| 

Page #225:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**Verse 8:**

**Meaning:** The **vyavaharanaya** (practical standpoint) considers the soul to be different from its previously mentioned characteristics due to the use of the sixth case ending (**ṣaṣṭhī**) and other case endings. However, the **niścayanaya** (absolute standpoint) does not consider it to be different in this way.

**Verse 9:**

**Meaning:** Just as the difference between a pot and its form is merely a product of **vikalpa** (conceptualization), so too is the difference between the soul and its qualities a product of **vikalpa**, not **tāttvika** (essential).

**Verse 10:**

**Meaning:** The **niścayanaya** experiences the pure form of the soul, while the **vyavaharanaya** experiences the difference in that excellent form.

**Verse 11:**

**Meaning:** In reality, the form of the qualities is not separate from the soul. Otherwise, the soul would become **anātma** (non-soul), and even knowledge and other things would become inert.

**Verse 12:**

**Meaning:** Due to the commonality of **chaitanya** (consciousness), all beings are one in essence. The **niścayanaya** recognizes that the difference created by **karma** (actions) is merely a temporary fluctuation.

**Chapter 18**

**Page 225** 

Page #226:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** Due to the universal sameness of all souls in their nature of consciousness, there is unity in the **Nischya Nay**. However, the difference arising from karma is illusory. ||12||

**Meaning:** The **Vyavahar Nay** considers the diversity of souls due to the difference in the group of beings and the order of birth, etc. ||13||

**Meaning:** This diversity of beings is not logical from the perspective of the **Nischya Nay**, because the entire group of beings is born from the different karmic natures of the 14 types of beings. This is not the nature of the soul. ||14||

**Meaning:** Birth, etc., are indeed the results of karma. And this karmic difference is not related to the unchanging soul. ||15|| 

Page #227:
---------------------------
**16.** Attributing only the karmic defilements to the self, those with corrupted knowledge wander in the ocean of samsara.

**17.** Just as a foolish person perceives the difference arising from the difference in the object as a difference in the crystal, so too does he perceive the karmic difference as being in the self.

**18.** There is no behavior arising from karmic objects for a being without karma (the self). Therefore, those who speak contrary to the self have omitted the words of the scriptures.

**19.** Just like the Dharma-stikaya, the self, though residing in one field, does not become associated with karmic qualities, because of its inherent nature of being non-material. 

Page #228:
---------------------------
Because the pure soul does not have the nature of being like a Dharma-astika. ||19|| Just as a person with night blindness (taimirika) considers one moon to be two, so too does a deluded person, due to uncertainty, consider the soul to be many. ||20||
Meaning: Just as a person with night blindness (taimirika) sees one moon as two, so too does a deluded person, due to uncertainty, consider one soul to be many. ||20|| Just as the existence of the soul's nature is experienced as one through inference, so too is the existence of the soul's similarity one, without any contradiction. ||21||
Meaning: Just as the existence of the soul's nature is experienced as one through inference, so too is the existence of the soul's similarity one, without any contradiction. ||21|| The friend, the pure path, protects the wise from the poison of the dualistic view (sadasadvad) and shows them the one jewel through practice. ||22||
Meaning: The friend, the pure path, protects the wise from the poison of the dualistic view (sadasadvad) and shows them the one jewel through practice. ||22||
228
Adhyatma-sara 

Page #229:
---------------------------
Even though the soul is born and destroyed in different states like human, hell, etc., it does not abandon its oneness, its inherent nature, which is always present. ||23||

Just as one gold exists in a bracelet, earrings, etc., so too, one pure soul exists in human, hell, etc. states. ||24||

These states of human, hell, etc. are due to karma, not the pure witness soul. Because karma is active in nature, and the soul is unborn in nature. ||25||

This creation of the world is not due to the nature of karma particles alone, nor is there another reality existing in the absence of each one. ||26|| 

Page #230:
---------------------------
It is by the nature of the *jiva* itself, but it is born from the nature of both, it exists; because if one of the two is absent (lacking), then there is no *samsara* itself. The state of *samsara* does not arise from any other element. ||26||

Just as whiteness is produced on a wall by white substance, and is beautiful without being inherent in both, so should the *prapancha* (the expanse of *samsara*) be understood. ||27||

Just as an object seen in a dream is not seen after waking up, so also the *sarga* (the world) perceived through *vyavahara* (conventional reality) is not seen by the *jnani* (the wise one). ||28||

Just as a stream of water appears to flow in a mirage at midday, so also the *sarga* born from *samyoga* (combination) appears due to the veil of *viveka-akhyati-viplava* (the reversal of the perception of discrimination). ||29||

Just as the Gandharvanagara and other cities appear in the sky are illusory, so too is the creation arising from conjunction, a mere play of appearances. (30)

**Meaning:** Just as the Gandharvanagara and other cities appear in the sky are illusory, so too is the creation arising from conjunction, a mere play of appearances. This is because the creation is not real, but is merely a product of the conjunction of the soul and karma. (30)

Thus, in the soul, oneness is attained through the pure nay, because the perfect-doctrine proponents do not desire the conception of parts, etc., in the pure substance-based nay. (31)

**Verse 32**

**Translation:** The statement (vada) of the collection (sangrahanaya) that grasps the absolute (dhruva vastu) states that the soul (atma) is pure light (jyotiswaroop) - free from bondage (bandha) and liberation (moksha) - pure light (jyotirman). ||32||

**Verse 33**

**Translation:** O Lord, the Soul (Atman)! I am afraid of your illusory form (mayamay roop) which is full of worldly attachments (prapancha), accumulations (sanchay), and afflictions (klishta). Therefore, be pleased with me and reveal your pure form (shuddh roop). ||33||

**Verse 34**

**Translation:** The one who knows the world (vyavaharavit) believes that the soul (atma) is one with the body (deha), because the soul (atma) experiences pain (vedana) etc. due to the attainment of some form (moortata). The one who knows the world (vyavaharavit) - that is, the one who follows the practical path (vyavaharanayavadi) - says, "The soul is inseparable from the body." However, the one who follows the path of certainty (nishchayanayavadi) refutes this statement, saying, "The soul is different from the body." But before this statement, the one who follows the practical path (vyavaharanay) supports his statement by arguing, "The soul is (in some way) inseparable from the body, because when someone strikes the body with a stick, etc., the pain (duhkha) is experienced by the soul."

This proves the definite corporeality (form) of the soul. Therefore, due to corporeality, the soul is considered inseparable from the body." ||34|| That conviction does not tolerate that the formless is not formless. Even a part of fire cannot comprehend coldness. ||35||
Meaning: This conviction does not tolerate that, just as fire cannot be cold, similarly, the formless soul cannot be corporeal even in the slightest. ||35|| Just as due to the association with hot fire, there is an illusion that ghee is hot, similarly, due to the association (relationship) with the corporeal body, there is an illusion that 'the soul is corporeal'. ||36||
Meaning: Just as due to the association with hot fire, there is an illusion that ghee is hot, similarly, due to the association (relationship) with the corporeal body, there is an illusion that 'the soul is corporeal'. ||36|| It has no form, no taste, no smell, no touch, no shape, and no sound. How can there be corporeality (form) of such a soul? ||37||
Meaning: It has no form, no taste, no smell, no touch, no shape, and no sound. How can there be corporeality (form) of such a soul? ||37|| It is invisible to the eyes, incomprehensible to the heart, and not even within the reach of words. What is self-luminous, its form, how can there be corporeality of that? ||38||
Authority: Eighteenth. 

Page #234:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** How can the soul, which is invisible to the eyes, imperceptible to the heart (mind), and inexpressible by words, but is itself luminous, be in the form of a body? Never! ||38||

**Meaning:** The soul is the essence of truth, consciousness, and bliss. It is subtle, beyond the subtle, and such a soul does not even touch the slightest bit of materiality. This is also what other philosophers have said. ||39||

**Meaning:** The senses are said to be superior (to the body), the mind is said to be superior to the senses, the intellect is superior to the mind, and the soul is superior to the intellect. ||40||

**Meaning:** Alas! In this world, due to the delusion of materiality regarding the immaterial, the wise man, bewildered by his intellect, sees with wonder and speaks words of wonder. ||41||

Pain is not the cause of the manifestation of the soul, for if it were, then the pudgalas would also experience pain. In reality, it arises from the impure inherent power of the soul itself. ||42||

Just as the soul itself transforms into knowledge through the senses, so too does it transform into pain through the contact of desirable and undesirable objects. ||43||

Having attained the time of fruition, the soul becomes a participant in the result of pain. Therefore, manifestation is not its cause. However, it is an attendant, like a stick to a pot. ||44||

Knowledge, consciousness, and awareness are called karma, while hatred and attachment are called karma. The fruit of karma is called the soul, and pain is described as its consequence. ||45||

Chapter Eighteen
235 

Page #236:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** The knowledge of the soul is called the consciousness of knowledge, and its hatred and attachment are called the consciousness of karma, and the fruit of that karma is called the consciousness of karma-phala, which is also called pain. ||45|| Therefore, the soul does not violate its formlessness and consciousness. This is why the soul is never one with the material body. ||46||

**Meaning:** In this way, the soul should be understood as distinct from the nearby pudgalas like mind, speech, and karma, and also from the distant pudgalas like wealth. ||47||

**Meaning:** The quality of pudgalas is materiality, and the quality of the soul is knowledge; therefore, the Jinas have said that the soul-substance is different from the pudgalas. ||48|| 

Page #237:
---------------------------
Dharmastikaya's quality is to be the cause of motion (hetu-tva), and the quality of the soul is knowledge. For this reason, the Jinas have said that jiva-dravya is different from Dharmastikaya. ||49||

The quality of Adharmastikaya is to be the cause of stability (sthiti-hetu-tva), while the quality of jiva-dravya is knowledge. Therefore, the Tirthankaras have said that jiva-dravya is different from Adharmastikaya. ||50||

The quality of space (vyom) is to provide space (avagaha), while the quality of the soul is knowledge. Therefore, the Tirthankaras have said that atma-dravya is different from vyom-astikaya. ||51||

The soul is endowed with the quality of knowledge, this is undeniably proven, while time (samaya) is endowed with the quality of change (vartana-guna). Therefore, the omniscient ones have said that atma-dravya is different from kala-dravya. ||52||

The difference between the soul and non-soul substances is established. Due to the order of the Nay of individual difference, the non-soul nature of the soul is also desired. ||53||

The worldly soul is non-soul in relation to pure feeling-life, and the pure-knowing liberated soul is non-soul in relation to substance-life. ||54||

**Meaning:** In relation to pure feeling-life, the worldly soul is non-soul, and in relation to substance-life, the pure-knowing liberated soul is non-soul. ||54||

The senses, strength, breathing, and lifespan are the four types of substance-life, whose modifications are based on the pudgala. ||55||

**Meaning:** The senses, strength, breathing, and lifespan are the four types of substance-life, whose modifications are based on the pudgala. ||55||

These are completely different from the soul; therefore, there is no life for the soul in those substance-lives which are modified by knowledge, energy, constant breathing, and eternal existence. ||56||

By these eternal powers, which are the nature of the soul, the soul lives eternally, this is the state (arrangement) of the pure substance (dravyaarthic) nay. ||57||

Meaning: By the power of these aforementioned eternal powers, such as knowledge, energy, etc., which are the nature of the soul, the soul lives eternally, this is the state (arrangement) of the pure substance (dravyaarthic) nay. ||57||

The soul lives without the breaths, and the soul lives only by those breaths.
Who can understand this wonderful character? ||58||

Meaning: The soul lives without the breaths, and the soul lives only by those breaths. Who can understand this wonderful character? ||58||

The soul is neither virtuous nor sinful, because (these) virtues and sins are pudgalatmak - they are in the form of pudgalas and are conceived as the material cause of the first childhood body. ||59||

Meaning: The soul is neither virtuous nor sinful, because (these) virtues and sins are pudgalatmak - they are in the form of pudgalas and are conceived as the material cause of the first childhood body. ||59||

Virtuous karma is called punya and non-virtuous karma is called papa. Why is punya called virtuous, because it throws beings into the pit of birth, causing them to take many births. ||60||

Neither in the bondage of iron nor in that of gold, which is covered with gold, is there any difference in dependence; therefore, there is no difference in the fruits. ||61||

**Meaning:** Whether the fetters are made of iron or gold, the dependence is the same in both; therefore, there is no difference in their fruits. ||61||

There is no difference between merit and demerit in terms of the fruits of happiness and suffering, because the fruit of merit, which is happiness, is not essentially different from suffering. ||62||

**Meaning:** There is no difference between merit and demerit in terms of the fruits of happiness and suffering, because the fruit of merit, which is happiness, is not essentially different from suffering. ||62||

The fruit of all merit is suffering, because it arises from karma. The foolish think that suffering is happiness because it is a compensation for suffering. ||63||

**Meaning:** The fruit of all merit is suffering, because it arises from karma. The foolish think that suffering is happiness because it is a compensation for suffering. ||63||

The wise consider the happiness arising from merit to be suffering because of its consequences, its pain, its karmic imprint, and its opposition to the nature of the soul. ||64||

Where there is constant mention of hatred towards one's opponents, even during the experience of happiness, there the mind is afflicted with sorrow, even when sitting peacefully at home. ||69||

Just as the burden does not actually decrease by transferring it from one shoulder to another, so too, the karmic impressions of sorrow are not truly eradicated by the enjoyment of the senses. ||70||

Happiness, sorrow, and delusion, these three are the activities of the Gunas. Although they are opposed to each other, they do not transcend the nature of sorrow, and therefore are sorrow-like. ||71||

All enjoyment arising from the senses is like the spread of a cobra's hood in anger. Even pleasurable enjoyment, like a beautiful painting, is a cause of fear for the discerning. ||72|| 

Page #243:
---------------------------
The diverse kinds of luxury are also a cause of fear for the wise. ||72|| Having attained oneness (siddh) in this way, as a result of merit and demerit. He who does not believe this, the foolish soul, has no end to his ocean of existence. ||73|| Due to these aforementioned reasons, the soul is distinct from both merit and demerit, which are both of the same nature as suffering. Because, from the perspective of pure conviction, the soul is always sat-chit-ananda-maya. ||74|| Just as the form of the sun, which is of the nature of heat and light, becomes visible when the clouds disappear, so too does the form of the soul, which is capable of being known in the fourth state, become visible when the coverings are destroyed. ||75|| Diverse thoughts and experiences of happiness arise from the eyes of the waking state. But the common nature is that of chit-ananda, which pervades all states. ||76||

**Meaning:** The awakened soul experiences various types of mental afflictions (ādhi) arising from the senses, while in general, the radiant, blissful, and ever-connected nature of the soul is manifested. ||76||

**Meaning:** Just as fire does not burn from a spark, nor does it generate heat in that state, similarly, the soul is not affected by these pleasurable experiences, nor is it overcome by them. ||77||

**Meaning:** Just as the sun shines in the state of deep sleep, without any sense of self, so too, in pure discernment, the blissful and witnessing nature of the soul is manifested with utmost clarity. ||78||

**Meaning:** Therefore, according to the perspective of pure discernment, the soul is the experiencer of pure bliss (cidānanda), while according to the perspective of impure discernment, it is the experiencer of pleasure and pain caused by karma. ||79||

Even in the case of karma, enjoyment, and objects of enjoyment, the practitioner should understand the system of the *naigama* and other *nayas* from this perspective. ||80||

**Meaning:** The soul experiences both *saataavedaniya* and *asaataavedaniya* karma, and due to the acceptance of the *vyavahara* perspective, it also experiences enjoyment of objects like garlands, clothes, ornaments, women, etc. The *naigama* (a *naya* that considers multiple possibilities) and other *nayas* like *sangraha* and *vyavahara* should also be understood from this perspective, i.e., through the framework of the *visheshgrahi* *naya*. In other words, scholars should carefully plan and understand these *nayas*. ||80||

The soul, being the *vibhu* (pervasive) due to the *shuddha* *naya*, is also the doer of pure actions, because this *shuddha* *naya* considers the soul as the doer based on the activity of pure moments. ||81||

**Meaning:** The soul, being pervasive due to the *shuddha* *naya*, is also the doer of pure actions, because this *shuddha* *naya* considers the soul as the doer based on the activity of pure moments. ||81||

The mind itself is the world, filled with passions and afflictions. It is said that when it is freed from these passions and afflictions, it becomes the **bhavant**. ||83||

**Meaning:** The mind, filled with passions and afflictions like anger, is the world, and the mind freed from these passions and afflictions is called the **bhavant**. ||83||

The moment of the mind that is afflicted is not the Self, because of the contradiction. The word **ananvavikrit** (unchanging) is appropriate for the form of the Self. ||84||

**Meaning:** The moment of the mind that is afflicted is not the Self, because of the contradiction, because the form of the Self is unchanging. Therefore, this word is meaningful. ||84||

Just as the statement "Only what is useful is heard" is false, so too is the statement "The Self is pure in form." This is what the **shabdanyaya** says. ||85||

**Meaning:** Just as the statement "Only what is useful is heard" is false, so too is the statement "The Self is pure in form." This is what the **shabdanyaya** says. ||85||

These Digambara, who consider the self as pure substance, declare it to be the doer of pure nature. They are to be understood as having extraordinary intellect. ||87||

Meaning: Those who consider the self as pure substance, like the Digambara, and declare it to be the doer of pure nature, should be understood as having extraordinary intellect. ||87||

The nature of the substance is pure, as stated by the venerable Siddhasena Divakara in the Sammatitarka, and is within the scope of the collection principle. ||48||

Meaning: This is the reason why the venerable Siddhasena Divakara, in the Sammatitarka, has stated that the pure nature of the substance is within the scope of the collection principle. ||48||

According to this principle, the self is not the doer of actions, because there is always a connection (relationship) between the self and actions. The self is merely a witness, remaining steadfast. ||89||

Meaning: According to the stated principle, the self is not the doer of actions, because there is always a connection (relationship) between the self and actions. Instead, the self is merely a witness, remaining steadfast. ||89||

This self, situated like an indifferent one, does not engage in any action. Just as the sky is not stained by mud, so too the self is not stained by karma. ||90||

The true nature of the self (ātman) is not to be made (kर्तव्य), but only to be known (ज्ञातव्य) by itself. Just as a lamp illuminates light, but does not create new light, so too the self does not create its own nature. 

Otherwise, if the self were to be created, it would be devoid of its own nature (स्वरूप) and become non-self (अनात्मा). And even with thousands of reasons, the non-self cannot become the self.

Therefore, according to this principle (नय), the self is not the doer (कर्त्ता), but the holder of pure consciousness (शुद्ध भाव). However, for the sake of convention (लोकोपचार), the self may be considered the doer, but there is no harm in that.

Those who believe in the creation of the qualities of the self (आत्मधर्माणां) are mistaken. They believe that these qualities are distinct and can be grasped. But since they are unmanifest (अव्यक्ति) and covered (आवृतेस्तेषां), how can they have any reality (नाभावादिति का प्रभा)? 

Page #249:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** This verse states the origin of the religions of the soul, which is the special recipient of the Nay. They are not without manifestation (non-manifestation) due to the covering, nor are they without manifestation due to the absence of the soul's dharma. What is the proof of this? ||14||

**Meaning:**  Sattva (substance) is not suitable in any way for the parasantaana (lineage of others), and since the santani (descendants) are impermanent, the santana (lineage) is also not dhruva (permanent). Just as in the birth of a son from a father, the cause of the father in the past leads to the effect of the son in the future, there is an absence of fatherhood and sonship before this. In this way, as fatherhood is destroyed through tradition, so too is sonship destroyed. Similarly, the tradition of the birth and destruction of the soul from parasantaana, that is, from the non-self (inert pudgala) other than itself, continues in various times. That is, from the flow of birth, there is an absence (destruction) of the past and the birth (existence) of the future. According to this, the destruction of the past and then the future will be proven, and the soul will become impermanent and perishable. However, the cause of sattva (substance) in the form of parasantaana is not justified in any way. Just as in the tradition of the thread, the right of the earth-like substance is the eighteenth...

There is no connection, in the same way, the offspring, that is, the impermanence of the Jivadi dravya (due to the non-permanence of the continuous oneness), the offspring (the dharma present in the action) is also not dhruva (eternal). From this, it is proved that the birth that occurred in the Deva, Manushya, Tiryanch and Naraka states, means that the soul was born; because there is an inseparable connection between dharma and dharmi. From this perspective, due to the impermanence of the offspring, the offspring is also proved to be impermanent. ||95||
Even the sky is born from the nature of its penetration into that-that substance, therefore, from the strength of this example, the eternality of Atmadharmas is not there. ||96|| ||96||
Meaning: For this reason, even the sky is born from the nature of its penetration into that-that substance, from the strength of this example, the eternality of Atmadharmas is not there. ||96||
The Riju Sutra Nay there considers it to be the doer.
The soul itself transforms into whatever state, whenever. ||97||

---------------------------
**Meaning:** This does not accept the agency of Nayaprabhavas, because two actions in one dravya are not accepted by the Jineswaras. ||98||

**Meaning:** The action that is to be in the lineage of one dravya is the same action, that action does not occur without samana jatiya in the qualities of the paradravya. ||99||

**Meaning:** If there is no other person (soul) who is the doer of other bhavas, then there will be no order of violence, compassion, charity, and stealing, etc. ||100||

**Meaning:** "My dear! Your statement is true that there is no dependent fruit for anyone; however, the karma that is present in oneself does not violate its own fruit. ||101||

**Meaning:** It does not harm anyone else, and certainly does not protect. Its lifespan is the destruction of karma, death is otherwise life. ||102||

**Chapter Eighteen**
**251** 

Page #252:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** From the perspective of **nirnaya-drishti** (certain vision), no one kills another, nor does anyone protect them. But when their **ayushya-karma** (life-span karma) is destroyed, death occurs. Otherwise, they remain alive. ||102||

**Meaning:** Only through the **svagata** (inherent) **himsa** (violence) and **daya** (compassion) within oneself, a person (**purusha**) attains diverse fruits without depending on others. ||103||

**Meaning:** Whether the body dies or not, **himsa** (violence) is certainly incurred by the **pramadi** (careless) being. But for one who strives with effort, even when killing beings, it is **daya** (compassion). ||104||

**Meaning:** It is not appropriate for anyone to give or take anything from another, because such giving or taking is not for **dharma** (righteousness) and **sukha** (happiness) due to the faults of **kritanasha** (destruction of merit) etc. ||105|| 

Page #253:
---------------------------
From two different things, like food and wealth, etc., how can there be giving and taking? Because giving is the acquisition of ownership, and taking is the destruction of ownership. ||106||

**Meaning:**  The soul is distinct from food, wealth, and other pudgalas. How can there be giving and taking of these things? Giving is the acquisition of ownership, and taking is the destruction of ownership. ||106||

And then, both giving and taking are due to the karmic fruition of the beings. They happen automatically (arise), what effort do the souls (purushas) have to make in this? ||107||

**Meaning:** Both giving and taking are the result of karmic fruition in beings. They happen automatically, without any effort from the souls. ||107||

Only from the feelings (parinaama vikalpa) of giving and stealing that are present in the soul, there is benefit and harm. There is no dependence on others for others. ||108||

**Meaning:**  The feelings of giving and stealing are inherent in the soul. They result in benefit and harm, respectively. There is no need for dependence on others. ||108||

Because of the pride in agency and other feelings that are dependent on others, the ignorant person is bound by karma. The wise person is not stained. ||109||

**Meaning:**  The ignorant person, due to pride in agency and other feelings that are dependent on others, is bound by karma. The wise person, on the other hand, is not stained by karma. ||109||

**Meaning:** Due to the pride of being the doer of actions arising from dependent states, the ignorant being is bound by karma, but the wise man is not attached to it. Now it is certain that the soul is not the doer of dependent states (states that depend on external factors like pudgala, etc.) or the actions arising from them. However, due to delusion, the ignorant being, who is devoid of true knowledge, becomes bound by karma due to the pride of being the doer and enjoyer of actions arising from dependent states (states that depend on external factors like pudgala, etc.). But, on the contrary, the wise man does not fall into this delusion and considers the soul to be the doer only of its own nature. He does not consider himself to be the doer or enjoyer of actions arising from dependent states (states that depend on external factors like pudgala, etc.). Therefore, he (the wise man) is not attached (bound) to that karmic bondage. || 109 ||

**Meaning:** In this way, the soul is not the doer of even the karma of the form of merit and demerit, but it is the doer of the consequences of attachment and aversion in relation to desirable and undesirable objects. || 110 ||

**Meaning:** When the soul desires or hates objects, it is due to the different possibilities of actions arising from them. When the soul is like this, then karma is attributed to it due to delusion. || 111 ||

## Translation:

**Verse 111:**

**Meaning:** When the soul, due to delusion, develops attachment (raga) or aversion (dvesha) towards objects through various actions, it gets bound by karma.

**Verse 112:**

**Meaning:** Just as dust sticks to the body of a person who has applied oil or similar substances, similarly, karma is considered to be bound to the soul that is filled with attachment and aversion.

**Verse 113:**

**Meaning:** Just as iron, due to its nature, gets attracted to a lodestone (magnet), similarly, various types of karma get attracted to a soul filled with attachment and aversion.

**Verse 114:**

**Meaning:** The soul does not engage in the act of accepting those karmas, but it creates the consequence of attachment and aversion, and through that, it becomes responsible for the eighteen types of karma. 

Page #256:
---------------------------
The one who is inclined to perform actions of attachment, etc., accepts the karma that is being transformed. ||114|| Just as a cloud that rains water is said to rain grain (food), so too the soul, which produces emotions, is also called the doer of pudgala karma. ||115|| The Naya of logic and the Naya of convention both say that the soul is the doer of karma, etc., because the soul's activity (inclination) is seen to extend to the fruit. ||116|| Where is the difference between these two Nayas that follow each other, like milk and water, until the ultimate end? There is no difference at all! ||117||

**Verse 118:**

*Nātmāno vikṛtiṁ datte, tadēṣā nayakalpana. Śuddhasya rajatasyēva śukti- dharma - prakalpana.*

**Meaning:** Just as the concept of the oyster's dharma is not attributed to the impurity of pure silver, so too, this nayakalpana (theory of relativity) is not attributed to the impurity of the soul.

**Verse 119:**

*Muṣitatvam yathā pānthagatam pathyupacaryatē. Tathā pudgalakarmastḥā vikriyā'ātmāni bāliśaiḥ.*

**Meaning:** Just as a traveler is robbed by a thief, and the remedy is said to be "he was robbed on the path," similarly, foolish people attribute the actions of karma (pudgalakarma) to the soul.

**Verse 120:**

*Kṛṣṇaḥ śoṇo'pi copādher nāśuddhaḥ sphaṭiko yathā. Raktō dviṣṭastathaivātmā samsargāt puṇyapāpayoḥ.*

**Meaning:** Just as a pure crystal appears black or red due to its adhyasa (superimposition), but is not actually impure, similarly, the soul, though not impure, appears to be attached and averse due to its association with merit and demerit (puṇya-pāpa).

**Verse 121:**

*Sēyaṁ natakalā tāvad yāvad vividhakalpana. Yad rūpaṁ kalpanātītaṁ tattu paśyatyakalpakaḥ.*

**Meaning:** This is the art of drama (natakalā) as long as there are various imaginations (vividhakalpana). The one who is free from imagination (akalpaka) sees the true form that is beyond imagination.

**Chapter Eighteen**

**Page 257** 

Page #258:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** As long as there are various kinds of imaginations, it is the art of the actors. But the form that is beyond imagination (transcendental), is seen only by the imagination-less (akalpika) soul. ||121||

**Meaning:** A being deluded by imagination sees white and black. But when that imagination is dissolved, he does not see white or black. ||122||

**Meaning:** Therefore, contemplation of the self-nature, devoid of merit and demerit, is the meditation of the Supreme Self, it is its praise, and it is said to be devotion. ||123||

**Meaning:** Describing the body, form, beauty, hair, umbrella, flag, etc. of the Vitaraga does not constitute real praise. ||124||

**Meaning:** This is the praise of the worldly, for those who are Vitaraga. The description of knowledge, etc., qualities, is the praise of certainty. ||125|| 258
Adhyatma Sara 

Page #259:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** This is all praise from a behavioral perspective.  To praise the knowledge and other qualities residing in the *vitrag* soul should be understood as true praise. || 125 ||

**Meaning:** Praise of a king through the description of his city, etc., is called praise by way of courtesy. But praise of his valor, gravity, patience, and other qualities is called true praise. || 126 ||

**Meaning:** Praise that is done without distinguishing between the main and subsidiary virtues is like the poetry of a bad poet, not pleasing to the mind. || 127 ||

**Meaning:** Otherwise, praise done with attachment is harmful, just like the edge of a sharp sword held carelessly in the hand. || 128 ||

**Chapter Eighteen**

Page #260:
---------------------------
By the principle of *Mani Prabha-Mani Jnana*, the knowledge of an object is obtained by touching it. This principle is applicable as long as the *Ananjanapratha* is not present. (129)

**Meaning:** The principle of *Mani Prabha-Mani Jnana* states that the brilliance of a gem reveals its true nature. Similarly, touching an object is a valid way to understand it. However, this principle is only applicable until the *Ananjanapratha* (a state of delusion or ignorance) is overcome.

**Explanation:** The *Ananjanapratha* is a state of mind where one is blinded by ignorance and cannot perceive reality clearly. In such a state, even touching an object may not lead to true knowledge.

**Verse 130:**

Being completely free from merit and demerit, being free from duality in the truth, and constantly meditating on the eternal Brahman - this is the state of pure *naya*. (130)

**Meaning:** The state of pure *naya* is characterized by complete liberation from the cycle of karma, which is manifested as merit and demerit. It is also characterized by the realization of the ultimate truth, which is beyond duality. This realization is achieved through constant meditation on the eternal Brahman.

**Verse 131:**

*Ashrava* and *Samvara* are not the characteristics of the soul, they are the characteristics of knowledge. *Ashrava* and *Samvara* are the acceptance and cessation of *karma pudgalas*, respectively. (131)

**Meaning:** *Ashrava* and *Samvara* are not the attributes of the soul itself. They are rather the characteristics of knowledge. *Ashrava* refers to the inflow of *karma pudgalas* (particles of karma) into the soul, while *Samvara* refers to the cessation of this inflow.

**Verse 132:**

The soul, through its own independent actions, accepts *karma pudgalas* due to the influences of *mithyatva*, *avirati*, and *kṣayās*. These are the internal *ashravas*. (132)

**Meaning:** The soul, through its own independent actions, accepts *karma pudgalas* due to the influences of *mithyatva* (false belief), *avirati* (lack of restraint), and *kṣayās* (passions). These are the internal *ashravas* that contribute to the inflow of karma. 

Page #261:
---------------------------
Yoga and the results of *kṣaya* should be understood as internal *āśrava*. ||132|| *Bhāvanā*, *dharma*, *cāritra*, *pariṣaha-jaya* etc., which are the destroyers of *āśrava*, are the *dharma* of the soul, they are called *bhāvasamvara*. ||133|| 

**Meaning:** *Bhāvanā*, the ten types of excellent *dharma*, *cāritra*, and *pariṣaha-jaya* etc., which are the destroyers of *āśrava*, are the *dharma* of the soul, they are called *bhāvasamvara*. ||133||

*Āśrava* cannot be *samvara*, and *samvara* cannot be *āśrava* at any time. Otherwise (if we do not accept this), due to the fault of *hetu* being mixed (one with the other), the fruits of *bhava* and *mokṣa* will become inseparable. ||134||

**Meaning:** *Āśrava* cannot be *samvara*, and *samvara* cannot be *āśrava* at any time. Otherwise (if we do not accept this), due to the fault of *hetu* being mixed (one with the other), the fruits of *bhava* and *mokṣa* will become inseparable. ||134||

The soul, with its different *pariṇāma*, accepts *karma* *āśrava* (reception) and also performs *samvara* (restraint), but it does not depend on others, because the soul is always self-sufficient. ||135||

**Meaning:** The soul, with its different *pariṇāma*, accepts *karma* *āśrava* (reception) and also performs *samvara* (restraint), but it does not depend on others, because the soul is always self-sufficient. ||135||

Chapter Eighteen
261 

Page #262:
---------------------------
All actions, such as violence and non-violence, are merely **nimitta** (conditions), because they are merely **parapraani paryaaya** (transformations of other beings) and not the cause of their own fruits. (136)

However, those who are deluded by worldly affairs consider these actions to be the cause. Because their minds are engrossed in external activities, they do not see the deeper truth. (137)

These actions do not touch the **niyama** (laws) and therefore do not attain **hetu** (causality). As many **aashrava** (influx) are mentioned, so many **parishrava** (efflux) are also mentioned. (138)

Therefore, there is complete irregularity (uncertainty) in external causes. Due to the diversity of emotions, the **aatma** (soul) itself is the **aashrava** and **sanvara** (influx and efflux). (139) 

Page #263:
---------------------------
This **āśrava** and **samvara** are fixed (certain). ||139|| Due to ignorance, the soul becomes attached to objects and is bound by them, not by the objects themselves. Through knowledge, the soul is liberated, not by scriptures or other **pudgalas**. ||140||
**Meaning:** The soul becomes attached to objects due to ignorance and is bound by **karma**, but not by the objects themselves. Similarly, the soul is liberated by knowledge, not by scriptures or other **pudgalas**. ||140|| Scriptures, respect for the guru, actions, and necessities, all these are said to be parts of **samvara** by those who are proficient in the world. ||141||
**Meaning:** Scriptures, respect for the guru, actions, and necessities, all these are said to be parts of **samvara** by those who are proficient in the world. ||141|| Specific **pudgalas** of speech, body, and mind are not fruitful, but the **bhāvas** of knowledge, etc., of the soul attain the form of **samvara**. ||142||
**Meaning:** Specific **pudgalas** of speech, body, and mind are not fruitful, but the **bhāvas** of knowledge, etc., of the soul attain the form of **samvara**. ||142|| Those who know the world attribute **samvara** to the auspicious **yogas** that are filled with the **bhāvas** of knowledge, etc., that are present in them. ||143||
**Meaning:** Those who know the world attribute **samvara** to the auspicious **yogas** that are filled with the **bhāvas** of knowledge, etc., that are present in them. ||143|| 

Page #264:
---------------------------
They take pride in attributing (**āropaṇa**) to themselves.  The virtuous man, situated in those good **yogas** filled with the results of the soul, such as knowledge, tranquility, and compassion, i.e., in the activities of mind, speech, and body motivated by **dharma**, attributes (**sankalpa**) to himself the nature of **samvarta** - the cessation of karma.  He proudly says, "We are righteous."  In reality, pride arises in one who does not know the truth.  The one who knows the truth does not have pride. ||143||

They also speak of the difference in results by attributing **āśrava** to the virtues like good conduct, which are associated with **praśastra-rāga**. ||144||

**Meaning:** They speak of the difference in results by attributing **āśrava** to the virtues like good conduct, which are associated with **praśastra-rāga**. ||144||

There is actually no contradiction in the causes of worldly existence and liberation.  It is only due to ignorance that this perception arises.  The wise one is not deluded by it. ||145||

**Meaning:** There is actually no contradiction in the causes of worldly existence and liberation.  It is only due to ignorance that this perception arises.  The wise one is not deluded by it. ||145||

The fact that the **tīrthankara** is said to be the cause of **samayakta** and that **āhāraka** is said to be the cause of extreme **samyama**, ||146|| and that **tapas** and **samyama** are said to be the cause of heaven in the previous two, 

Page #265:
---------------------------
The statement that **Samyaktvam** is the cause of **Tirthankara-nama** and that **utkrista-samyama** is the cause of the **aaharaka-sharira** is like saying "ghee burns". This is because the **aaharaka-sharira** is only attained by a **muni** who is **utkrista** (exceedingly) **labdhivan** (possessing knowledge and insight) and **samyami** (practicing self-restraint). The previous **tapa** (austerity) and **samyama** were said to be the cause of **swarg** (heaven), which is a statement that is appropriate in terms of **upacara** (figurative language). || 146-147 ||

The **atma** (soul) has **ashrava** (influx of karma) in the same proportion as it has **yoga** (union with the divine), and it has **sanvara** (stopping of influx) in the same proportion as it has **upayoga** (use) of **jnana** (knowledge) etc. || 148 ||

Therefore, the **atma**, resting in its **ansha** (parts), bears **ashrava** and **sanvara**, always shining like a mirror with two parts, one **swachchha** (pure) and the other **aswachchha** (impure). || 149 ||

The **jnana-dhara** (stream of knowledge) becomes **shuddha** (pure) after attaining **samyaktvam**.

**Adhikara** (Chapter) 18th
265 

Page #266:
---------------------------
Due to the difference in the cause, the stream of yoga flows in a variety of ways. ||150||
Meaning: After attaining Samyaktva, the stream of knowledge is pure, and due to the difference in the cause, the stream of yoga flows in a variety of ways. ||150|| The Samyagdrsti is pure in all ten states. The subtle, medium, and excellent states are due to the variety of actions. ||151||
Meaning: After that, the Samyagdrsti becomes pure in all ten states. The subtle, medium, and excellent states are due to the variety of actions. ||151|| When both streams become pure in all ways, then there is Sarvansavara due to the stability called Shaileshi. ||152||
Meaning: And when both streams become pure in all ways, then there is Sarvansavara due to the stability called Shaileshi. ||152|| Before that, whatever and however much stability there is in the soul, that much is the soul's Samvara, and whatever and however much fickleness there is in the yogas, that much is the Ashrava. ||153||
Meaning: Before that, whatever and however much stability there is in the soul, that much is the soul's Samvara, and whatever and however much fickleness there is in the yogas, that much is the Ashrava. ||153|| Thus, the story of Samvara, Ashrava, and impurity. ||266||
Adhyatma Sara 

Page #267:
---------------------------
There is no difference between the worldly beings and the Siddhas in terms of pure Nayas. ||154||

**Meaning:** Thus, the concept of restraint and inflow for worldly beings is based on impure Nayas, but there is no difference for Siddhas even in pure Nayas. As stated earlier, the acceptance of impure Naigamadi Dravyarthic Nayas, which involves the purification of general and specific aspects and the acceptance of the nature of things, leads to the concept (consideration) of restraint and inflow for worldly beings. However, for liberated beings, there is no difference because they rely on pure Nayas, which are all-inclusive and synonymous. Therefore, there is no consideration of inflow and restraint there. In reality, impure Nayas consider the soul to be in the form of inflow, restraint, and synonyms. Pure Nayas consider the soul to be only in the form of knowledge, etc. According to them, there are no two distinctions of the soul, worldly and Siddha. They consider the soul to be different from inflow and restraint. ||154||

The destruction of karmas is called Nirjara. Nirjara is a synonym for karma and is not the soul, but the state by which Nirjara of karma occurs is the characteristic of the soul. ||155|| 

Page #268:
---------------------------
Knowing ||155|| Sattapa is twelvefold, endowed with pure knowledge. It is born of the power of the soul, and is the suppressor of mental activities. ||156||
Meaning: Sattapa, which is born of the power of the soul, is the suppressor of mental activities and is endowed with pure knowledge, is of twelve types. ||156|| Where there is suppression of passions, meditation on Brahman and the Jina, that should be understood as pure tapa, the rest is merely transgression. ||157||
Meaning: That tapa in which there is suppression of passions, meditation on Brahman and non-attachment, should be understood as pure tapa, the rest should be understood as transgression. ||157|| Hunger or bodily emaciation is not a characteristic of tapa. The knowledge that is the place of forbearance, celibacy, etc., is the body of that tapa. ||158||
Meaning: Hunger and bodily emaciation are not characteristics of tapa, but the knowledge that is the place of forbearance, celibacy, etc., is the body of that tapa. ||158|| With skillful knowledge, unity is attained, like the fragrance of sandalwood. When given to the self, it is a tapa unlike any other. ||159||
Meaning: Tapa, united with skillful knowledge, like sandalwood and its fragrance, purifies the soul.

No other kind of austerity can ever bring about liberation. ||159|| The ascetic, through devotion to the Jinas and the desire to uplift the Dharma, accumulates great merit and, being free from all desires, attains liberation. ||160|| The ascetic who does not know that knowledge which burns away karma is the true austerity, how can such a deluded soul attain great liberation? ||161|| The ignorant person destroys karma through austerity over countless lifetimes, while the ascetic endowed with knowledge and austerity destroys it in an instant. ||162||

## English Translation:

**Verse 163:**

**Text:** *Jnanayogatapah shuddhamityahurmuni pungavaha | Tasmann nikachitasyaapi karmanoyujyate kshayah ||163||*

**Meaning:** The wise sages declare that *jnanayoga* (the path of knowledge) is the purest form of austerity, for it leads to the destruction of even *nikachita* karma (karma that has been accumulated over many lifetimes).

**Verse 164:**

**Text:** *Yadiha'apurvakaranam shreni, shuddha cha jayate | Dhruvah sthitikshayastatra sthitanam prachyakarmnam ||164||*

**Meaning:** Because this *jnanayoga* austerity produces *apurvakaranam* (a new beginning) and a pure *shreni* (series of actions), it inevitably destroys the state of *prachyakarma* (past karma) for those who practice it.

**Verse 165:**

**Text:** *Tasmaj jnanmaya shuddha tapasvi bhavanirjara | Shuddhanischayatastu esha sada shuddhasyakapi || 165||*

**Meaning:** Therefore, the *jnanmaya* (knowledge-filled) and pure *tapasvi* (austerity practitioner) is like a *bhavanirjara* (a stream that flows without obstruction), and due to their pure conviction, they are always free from any *nirjara* (obstruction) like the pure soul (the *siddha*).

**Verse 166:**

**Text:** *Bandhah karmaatmasamslesho dravyatah sa chaturvidhah | Taddhethvadhyavasaayatma bhavatastu prakirtitah || 166||*

**Meaning:** The union of the soul with karma is called *bandha* (bondage). It is of four types in terms of its material aspect, and it is described as *taddhethvadhyavasaayatma* (the soul's identification with its actions) in terms of its mental aspect. 

Page #271:
---------------------------
From the standpoint of *bhaava*, it is called *adhyavasaya* which is the cause of *bandha*. ||166|| Just as a serpent encircles itself with its own body, so too does a being, transformed by its *bhaava*, bind itself with its own self. ||167||
**Meaning:** Just as a snake wraps its body with its own body, similarly, a being, transformed by its *bhaava*, binds its soul (its *parinaama*) with its own soul. ||167||
It binds itself, just as a silkworm binds itself with its own threads. This simile has been given by the wise. ||168||
**Meaning:** Just as a silkworm binds its body with its own threads, similarly, the soul binds itself with its own *bhaava*s, this simile has been given by the wise. ||168||
It is not God who binds the sinful beings; because the binder is non-existent and there is no activity for the unbound. ||169||
**Meaning:** It is not God who binds the sinful beings; because the binder is non-existent and there is no activity for the unbound. ||169||
Nor is there a constant instigator, like a wise person, to cause activity in ignorance. This is not seen in actions done without understanding, like in dreams, etc. ||170||
**Meaning:** There is no constant instigator, like a wise person, to cause activity in ignorance. This is not seen in actions done without understanding, like in dreams, etc. ||170|| 

Page #272:
---------------------------
There is no motivation. Because in actions done unknowingly in dreams etc., that motivation is not seen. || 170 ||
Thus, the being, by its own nature, is motivated.
Binding both merit and demerit, according to the consequences. || 171 ||
Meaning: According to the consequences, the being, motivated by its own nature, binds merit and demerit. || 171 ||
From pure conviction, the soul is not bound, it is unbound; but due to the fear of bondage, it experiences fear, trembling, etc., like the illusion of a snake in a rope. || 172 ||
Meaning: From pure conviction, the soul is not bound, it is unbound; but due to the fear of bondage, it experiences fear, trembling, etc., like the illusion of a snake in a rope. || 172 ||
Just as the behavior of a sick person is according to the state of the disease, so also the bondage is described in relation to the state of existence. || 173 ||
Meaning: Just as the behavior of a sick person is according to the state of the disease, so also the bondage is described in relation to the state of existence. || 173 ||
According to the being's bondage
Those who desire to remove this firm ignorance-filled doubt,
Desire to hear the spiritual scriptures, seeking dispassion. || 974 ||

This science, by the analogy of the branch and the moon, only shows the direction, but indirect knowledge does not remove doubts about direct objects. ||175||
Meaning: This science, by the analogy of the branch and the moon, only shows the direction, but indirect knowledge does not remove doubts about direct objects. ||175||
Just as, even though there is knowledge of whiteness in the conch shell, due to a defect, there is the perception of yellowness, similarly, even though there is knowledge of the scriptures, due to the influence of false perception, there is the perception of bondage in the soul. ||176||
Meaning: Just as, even though there is knowledge of whiteness in the conch shell, due to a defect, there is the perception of yellowness, similarly, even though there is knowledge of the scriptures, due to the influence of false perception, there is the perception of bondage in the soul. ||176||
Those who, having heard, contemplated, and remembered, experience it directly, do not have the perception of bondage, their soul, free from bondage, shines. ||177||
Meaning: Those who, having heard, contemplated, and remembered, experience it directly, do not have the perception of bondage, their soul, free from bondage, shines. ||177||
Liberation of substance is the destruction of karmic substances, not the characteristic of the soul. Liberation of essence is its cause, the soul is endowed with the three jewels. ||178||

## Translation:

**Verse 182:**

Those who dwell in the **Bhavalinga** are knowers of the essence of all things. Therefore, whether they are in the garb of a **Sadhu** or a householder, they attain the state of **Siddhi** by destroying their karmas.

**Meaning:** Those who are in the **Bhavalinga** are enlightened and understand the true nature of reality. Their state of being, whether they are renunciates or householders, is a means to attain liberation.

**Verse 183:**

The **Bhavalinga** is the means to liberation, while the **Dravyalinga** is not. This is because the **Dravyalinga** is not the ultimate goal, nor is it the only means to liberation.

**Meaning:** The **Bhavalinga**, which is the state of being free from attachment and identification with the body, is the path to liberation. The **Dravyalinga**, which is the physical body, is not the cause of liberation.

**Verse 184:**

If one claims that the ten types of garments worn at birth are inseparable from the goal of liberation, then what is the proof for this claim? In the absence of any opposing evidence, even animals like deer, who are born naked, would also attain liberation. If the nakedness of all beings is not desirable for liberation, then what is the evidence for claiming that nakedness is the cause of liberation?

**Meaning:** The argument that the ten types of garments worn at birth are essential for liberation is flawed. If this were true, then animals who are born naked would also attain liberation. This is absurd, as nakedness is not a requirement for liberation.

**Verse 185:**

If one claims that wearing clothes is an obstacle to liberation, then what is the purpose of wearing clothes? Just as the hand is an obstacle to the act of eating, so too is clothing an obstacle to liberation.

**Meaning:** The argument that wearing clothes is an obstacle to liberation is illogical. If this were true, then there would be no reason to wear clothes at all. 

Page #276:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** If the desire to wear clothes is an obstacle to liberation, then what is the obstacle to having clothes worn like hands, etc., without the desire for them? || 185 || If clothes are an obstacle to omniscience by their very nature, then according to the Digambara view, they should be like the omniscience-obscuring (kevalgyanavaran) || 186 || In this way, if someone throws clothes on the head of a Kevali, then their omniscience should be lost (run away), what a nonsensical (unsuitable, absurd) statement is this? || 187 || Therefore, liberation is certain even for those with different lingas (bodies) from the bhavalinga (original body). Therefore, a wise man should consider this, giving up attachment to the body. || 188 || The soul is bound and liberated according to the impure path. It is not bound or liberated according to the pure path. || 189 || 

Page #277:
---------------------------
**Verse 189:**

**Meaning:** From the perspective of the impure Nay, the soul is bound and liberated. However, from the perspective of the pure Nay, there is neither bondage nor liberation of the soul.

**Verse 190:**

**Meaning:** A wise person should determine the nature of the soul through the principles of Anvaya (inclusion) and Vyatireka (exclusion) from the nine Tattvas.

**Verse 191:**

**Meaning:** This is the highest Adhyatma, this is the nectar, this is the highest knowledge, and this is called the supreme Yoga.

**Verse 192:**

**Meaning:** This is a more secret (guhya) than secret (guhyatar) truth, dependent on the subtle Nay. Therefore, it is not suitable to give this truth to those with limited understanding. For they often mock it.

**Verse 193:**

**Meaning:** This truth is not beneficial for people with limited understanding. It is like food for the weak and hungry, just as it is for a wheel.

**Chapter 18**

**Page 277** 

Page #278:
---------------------------
_ **Meaning:** Just as heavy food is not beneficial for weak and hungry individuals, similarly, this knowledge of the Self is not beneficial for those with limited intellect. ||193||

**Meaning:** Just as it is harmful for one who recites impure mantras to obtain the gem of the serpent king, similarly, this knowledge is harmful for those who consider themselves great scholars after acquiring a mere fragment of knowledge. ||194||

**Meaning:** One who is not skilled in the conduct of worldly affairs, if he desires to know the knowledge of certainty, is like someone who is unable to cross a small pond but desires to cross the ocean. ||195||

**Meaning:** Therefore, one who takes refuge in the pure path should first determine the conduct of worldly affairs and then, being devoted to the knowledge of the Self, attain the highest equality. ||196||

[Praise of Jainism] The tumultuous waves of conduct and determination, the group of turtles of the path of isolation, the crumbling mountains of wrong views, all are terrifying. The ocean of Jainism, adorned by the entry of rivers of irrefutable arguments and bound by the limits of Syadvada, is beautiful. I will not seek refuge in anything else. ||1||
**Meaning:** The group of turtles of the path of isolation is distressed by the tumultuous waves of conduct and determination, with mountains of wrong views crumbling. The ocean of Jainism, adorned by the entry of rivers of irrefutable arguments and bound by the limits of Syadvada, is beautiful. I will not seek refuge in anything else. ||1||

The tree of Syadvada, adorned with the flowers of pure conduct and the construction of proofs, is always established and bears the fruit of knowledge of reality. It always triumphs. From this tree, the flowers of teachings have fallen, making the garden of six philosophies fragrant again with the desired scents of spiritual discussions. ||2||

---------------------------
The **syādvāda**-tree, a wish-fulfilling tree, is always victorious. Its branches are adorned with **pravāda**-flowers, small and filled with the essence of the desired and the spiritual, which spread a fragrant aroma over the land of the **ṣaḍdarśana**-garden. ||2||

Adorned with the beauty of peaks formed by the creation of **citrotsarga** and auspicious **apvāda** paths, it is fragrant with the wisdom that shines like sandalwood trees in the **śraddhā**-forest.  Always served by the **paradarśana**-planets that wander around it, and elevated by the golden stones of **tarka**, the **Jaināgama**-mountain, like Mount Meru, is victorious. ||3||

**Meaning:** The **Jaināgama** is adorned with the beauty of various **citrotsarga** and auspicious **apvāda** paths. It is fragrant with the wisdom that shines like sandalwood trees in the **śraddhā**-forest.  Always served by the **paradarśana**-planets that wander around it, and elevated by the golden stones of **tarka**, the **Jaināgama**-mountain, like Mount Meru, is victorious. ||3||

The **syāddosa**-mist disappears from the world in an instant, the paths become clear, the deep sleep of the eyes departs. When this **Jaināgama** rises, like the sun at the beginning of a day, it brings auspiciousness to the world. It gives strength to the **naya**-speech and brings joy. ||4||

**Meaning:** When the **Jaināgama** rises, the night of **moha** (delusion) disappears from the world, the darkness of ignorance disappears from the earth, and the deep sleep of the eyes departs. It brings auspiciousness to the world, gives strength to the **naya**-speech, and brings joy. ||4|| 

Page #281:
---------------------------
In a moment, they are extinguished and the paths become pure (clean), the deep sleep is removed from the eyes. At the beginning of the day, which is the proof, the auspicious Nayavaani attains maturity. It is enriched by the Sun in the form of Jain Agamas. ||4||

The one who always rises, showering the earth with the nectar of spirituality, and makes the earth's sphere (lotus) flourish with the playful beauty of speech that destroys the spread (transmission) of heat (sun). The one who is situated on the head of the pillar of logic, surrounded by brilliant stars in the form of Nayas. This moon in the form of the Jina Shastra, who does not find it pleasing? ||5||

Meaning: The moon in the form of Jain Agamas always rises, showering the earth with the nectar of spirituality, and makes the earth's sphere (lotus) flourish with the playful beauty of speech that destroys the spread (transmission) of heat (sun). The one who is situated on the head of the pillar of logic, surrounded by brilliant stars in the form of Nayas. This moon in the form of the Jina Shastra, who does not find it pleasing? ||5||

The Buddhist view arose from the Riju Sutra Nay, the Vedanta view arose from the Sangraha Nay, the Sankhya view arose from the Nigamana Nay, and Yoga and Vaisheshika arose from the same. Even the Shabda Brahmavids, who know the word, are bound by all the Nayas. The Jain view is seen here as the most essential, directly. ||6||

Meaning: The Buddhist view arose from the Riju Sutra Nay, the Vedanta view arose from the Sangraha Nay, the Sankhya view arose from the Nigamana Nay, and Yoga and Vaisheshika arose from the same. Even the Shabda Brahmavids, who know the word, are bound by all the Nayas. The Jain view is seen here as the most essential, directly. ||6|| 

Page #282:
---------------------------
It has originated from **Sangrahanaya**. Yoga and Vaisheshika philosophies have originated from **Naigamanya**. And the philosophy of the Mimamsakas, who consider word as Brahman, has originated from **Shabdanya**. But Jain philosophy is interwoven with all **Nayas**. Therefore, the superiority of Jain philosophy is evident. ||6||

Just as the sun cannot remove the heat, sparks cannot remove the fire, the flood of the river cannot remove the ocean, and the falling boulder cannot shake Mount Meru, in the same way, the Jineendra Agama, which is the supreme abode of the unique nature of all **Nayas**, cannot be defeated by the partial creation-like statements of other philosophies. ||7||

It is difficult for opponents to criticize other philosophies without their own, and their criticism leads to the mind becoming polluted with the mud of **Kashaya**. This is the beginning of the **Vetala** who is determined to take away what is not his own. This is not the Jain philosophy, which is for the benefit of all and for the understanding of the truth. ||8|| 

Page #283:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** It is difficult for the Paravadiyas (those with other philosophies) to prove their own views without criticizing the views of others (refutation, contempt). And that contempt stains the mind with the mud of kṣaya (negative emotions). Therefore, this business is like the anger of a Vetala (a malevolent spirit) who is eager to take possession of a poor man's treasure. Such a step (undertaking) is not in the best interests of those who are seeking the truth in the Jain philosophy. ||8||

**Meaning:** There are thousands of arguments in each philosophy, arranged in a sequence based on different aspects of knowledge. Yet, our mind, deeply immersed in the Agamas of the Jinas, does not even go towards those arguments. Do not many vines, adorned with flowers, appear in every direction during the spring season? Many do, yet the cuckoo, attached to the mango bud, does not find pleasure in those (other) vines. ||9||

**Meaning:** Whether it is words, thoughts, wealth, caste, action, or qualities, the question of "what is the meaning of words?" remains a source of doubt, suspicion, and distress for those with different views. ||9||

Jainen̄dre tu mate na sa pratipad jātyantarāth sthiteḥ | Sāmānyaṁ ca viśeṣameva ca yathā tātparyam anvicchati ||10||
Bhāvartha:  Is the soul a word? Is it intellect? Or is it a caste, an action, or a quality? Is it the meaning of a word? In this way, in every opinion (philosophy), there is the pain of a nail of doubt. But in the Jainen̄dra opinion (philosophy), since every word has the meaning of jātyantara, there is no such pain of doubt; because it clearly finds the general and the particular according to the intention. ||10||
Yatrānarpitam ādhadhāti guṇatāṁ mukhyaṁ ca vastvārpitam, tātparyānavalambanena tu bhaved bodhaḥ sphuṭaṁ laukikaḥ || Saṁpūrṇaṁ tvavabhāsate kṛtadhiyām kṛtsnād vivakṣākramāt | Tāṁ lokoत्तरbhanga paddhatim ayīṁ syādvāda mudrāṁ stumaḥ ||11||
Bhāvartha: Where the unpresented object acquires secondary importance and the presented object acquires primary importance, and without relying on the intention, worldly knowledge becomes clear. For skilled intelligent men, the whole object is revealed by the order of the whole intention. We praise that syādvāda mudrā, which is endowed with the method of transcendental breaking (non-worldly alternative creation). ||11|| 284

### 285

**Verse 12:**

The **Jinaagama**, whose subject matter is the experience of the soul, is of the highest order. It is like Sanskrit to the **mleccha** (non-Aryan), causing wonder and delusion in the minds of the simple. We, having thoroughly understood the **Jinaagama** with its detailed explanations of origin, comprehension, and reasons, based on the **syadvada** (doctrine of conditional affirmation), are never subject to criticism.

**Verse 13:**

The **Jinaasana** (Jain doctrine) is the well-known source of the meaning of all scriptures. To refute it with the doctrines of **naya** (principles of logic) that are derived from it, is like a man cutting off his own branch, a foolish act of the **tarkarthins** (those who seek to argue) whose minds are covered with the dirt of sin. This is a cruel act that will only bring them suffering. 

Page #286:
---------------------------
Having heard the nectar of the ear, the composition of the *anekanta* (non-absolutist) doctrine, which is free from delusion and division, where can a knower of the secrets of the true meaning of the principles find delight in any other scripture? In which all *nayas* (perspectives) enter, but do not exist in those scattered *nayas* themselves. Just as there are beads in a garland, but if those beads are scattered and separate, there is no garland. ||14||

**Meaning:** Having abandoned delusion and composed a doctrine worthy of division (anekanta), a knower of the secrets of the meaning of the principles, having heard the nectar of the ear, where can he find delight in any other scripture? In which all *nayas* enter, but do not exist in those scattered *nayas* themselves. Just as there are beads in a garland, but if those beads are scattered and separate, there is no garland. ||14||

The one who, by virtue of his own truth, divides the *nayas* that are false due to their mutual opposition, and their own meaning, without relying on biased views, and by adhering to the middle path. He, placing the mind on the path of *syadvada*, removes their delusion. The fame of the victor, like that of the jasmine and the moon, increases. ||15||

**Meaning:** For those whose wrong perceptions, passions, and defilements (attachment and aversion) have been destroyed by the direction indicated in the scriptures, a certain desirable secret is revealed, which can only be known through experience. ||1||

This secret, which appears from the delight of the first practice, makes the mind, which is absorbed in it for a moment, very eager, like the charming delight of a young woman. ||2||

Meaning: Therefore, beautiful images of the Jinas, distinctive words, syllables, and sentence structures, as well as special types of men, etc., are also said to be objects of support. ||14||

**Meaning:** Therefore, from good supports, there are usually good states of mind. A yogi who desires this support should attach his mind to a good support. ||15||

**Meaning:** One should make the mind dependent (connected to a good support) for a moment and independent (free from support) for a moment. By doing so, when the experience ripens, the mind becomes independent (free from support) for life. ||16||

**Meaning:** When the mind, taking hold of one object, does not think of anything else, then it becomes calm like a fire that has no fuel. ||17||

But we experience the delight of Brahman even from the words of those who know Brahman. The one who is established in pure knowledge and use in Brahman, that is, the Supreme Soul, and who knows Brahman (unchangeable consciousness), attains Brahman (pure soul). What is surprising in this? Nothing is surprising. Even from the words of the knowers of Brahman (those who know Brahman), we experience the delight of Brahman (the joy of pure consciousness) with our intellect, we can know it directly.

**Meaning:** Having thus ascertained the truth of the scriptures, the yogi should constantly strive for purity of faith and discrimination, abandoning worldly opinions. ||37||

**Meaning:** No one in the world should be condemned; even towards the most sinful, one should consider their state of existence. The virtuous, who are full of merit, should be honored, and attachment should be maintained even towards those who are inferior in virtue. ||38||

[Praise of the Noble]

Those whose virtues, like the white lotus, the cluster of Kunda flowers, the moon, and camphor, cleanse the minds of the seekers and spread purity, those who have made their own interests secondary and the welfare of others primary, may such noble souls be pleased with me; what do I care for the extremely wicked, who are completely unrestrained? ||1||

**Meaning:** Those whose radiant virtues, like the white lotus, the cluster of Kunda flowers, the moon, and camphor, cleanse the minds of the seekers and spread purity, those who have made their own interests secondary and the welfare of others primary, may such noble souls be pleased with me; what do I care for the extremely wicked, who are completely unrestrained? ||1||

The noble ones, with their waves of grace and beauty, enhance the meaning of the scriptures and spread the fame of the poet. Like the beautiful honey-sweet blossoms of the Madhuka tree, they spread their fragrance. The male cuckoos, with their five wondrous qualities, proclaim their good fortune. ||2|| 

Page #302:
---------------------------
They (spread) increase. Just as the beautiful, strange spring-time mango tree spreads its blossoms, but its good fortune is made known everywhere by the excellent cuckoos with the wonder of their five-note song. ||2|| The poison of fault-mentioning, arising from the mouth-like burrow of a wicked man, burning with anger, like a tongue-shaped serpent, does not destroy what growing quality of the virtuous? It destroys all qualities. ||3|| Because of the natural understanding of straightforward words, they considered them to be devoid of essence. In support of profound meaning, indeed, wicked men gave the fault of hardness. What is the name of that quality, what is a good poet, what is poetry, etc. - these doubts are removed by the established order of the virtuous. ||4|| 

Page #303:
---------------------------
They blame the difficulty (hardness) in conveying the profound meaning. What kind of quality is this? What kind of poet is this? And what kind of poetry is this? That the intellect, which is capable of destroying such a situation, is taken away by the fixed arrangements seen by the virtuous. ||4||

Even though they drink the nectar-like rain of spiritual knowledge, the virtuous find happiness, while the wicked vomit poison. Where does this disparity come from? Or is this not a matter of wonder; because the chakor birds are extremely happy by drinking the rays of the moon, but is the young pair of chakravakas not sorrowful at the rise of the same moon? They are. ||5||

Those who, seeing some similarity, create a blue-like appearance in the glass, their subtle intellect is not a source of delight for the profound poets. Those who know the difference, even in the unevenness, line by line, they have great celebration for the objects of the virtuous. ||6||

Chapter Twenty-First
303 

Page #304:
---------------------------
**Verse 6:**

**Meaning:** Those with limited intellect, who perceive no difference between glass and sapphire due to their superficial resemblance, find no joy in the profound creations of poets. But those with discerning minds, who recognize even the subtlest distinctions in seemingly similar things, find such creations a grand celebration.

**Verse 7:**

**Meaning:** For those whose vision is clouded by delusion, the composition of the entire body of spiritual knowledge does not evoke wonder, as it does for the learned. The clever speech of a woman, filled with double entendres, fueled by the pride of desire, and overflowing with eloquence, does not delight the common folk, as it does the wise.

**Verse 8:**

**Meaning:** We bow to those noble souls who, having bathed in the pool of principles, cleansed by the radiant waters of spiritual knowledge, have shed the suffering of the world, the impurities of the Kali Yuga, greed, and desire. They have emerged pure, adorned with the sandalwood of tranquility, self-control, and purity. They are the essence of virtuous adornment, the treasure house of all virtues. 

Page #305:
---------------------------
**Meaning:** We bow down to those noble souls who, like the moonbeams in a pool of doctrine, have bathed in the pure waters of spirituality, shedding the suffering of the world, the pain, the impurities of sin, and the thirst of greed. They have adorned themselves with the sandalwood of calmness, restraint, and purity, and have become the essence of virtue, adorned with the jewels of good conduct. They are like a treasure trove of all virtues. ||8||

**Meaning:** The author, like a raincloud of beautiful verses, showers down a vast collection of emotions. This downpour of love flows rapidly into the hearts of the virtuous, filling their lakes of good fortune. But the hearts of the wicked, who are filled with hatred for virtue, are broken. It is a wonder that tears of love flow from the eyes of the wise. ||9||

**Meaning:** The great poets, like churning the ocean of milk with Mount Meru, churn out the essence of their great works, which are filled with the glory of their noble thoughts. This is the twenty-first chapter. ||9|| 

Page #306:
---------------------------
This is the ocean of milk, the accumulation of fame born from the expansion of the profound meaning of the great works of the virtuous poets. It is churned by the wise, compassionate, learned, who are like gods, with the mountain Meru as the churning rod. The foam that arises from this churning is like the orb of the moon's radiance, and the extremely leaping drops of the sound of recitation become stars. And Mount Kailasa and the like take on the form of the waves rising in this ocean of milk. ||10||

Seeing the poetry of the poets, the gentle-hearted gentleman, fearing that it has stolen the nectar of the gods, shakes his head in regret, being apprehensive of drinking. Knowing that the flood of fame is enjoyable and spreadable for all, he is always delighted with a smile, knowing the impermanence of protection and covering. ||11||

##  English Translation:

**Verse 12:**

Skilled poets, like potters, mold verses into a pot using the clay of skillful rhetoric. They then expose it to the sun of true scrutiny, adding some strength.  With a mind that devours virtues, they plunge the pot into the fiery flames of a tongue, a blazing inferno of fault-finding, fueled by the words of wicked men. This process makes the verses strong and enduring.

**Verse 13:**

The words of poets, like a blend of sugarcane and grape juice, are poured into the fiery furnace of a wicked man's mouth.  This mixture of various meanings, like different ingredients, enhances the quality and quickly transforms into a potent drink.  Good men, upon drinking this nectar, experience immense joy, their eyes sparkle with delight, and they spontaneously break into dance and song, overwhelmed by their happiness.

The Sumeru mountain, heated by the rays of the tireless, wandering, beautiful constellations, is cooled by the water flowing from the celestial Ganges, which is disturbed by the noise of the groups of celestial nymphs singing in praise of the glory of those great teachers. In this group of virtuous people, the wise Muni, Nayavijaya, is prominent. ||15||
