These are the scriptures of the Tirthankaras, written by those who have acquired the wealth through righteous means.
They are indeed writing the certificate of acceptance of residence in the city of liberation.
Whomsoever they may be, the fathers are worshipful for the virtuous.
The renowned must indeed renounce what is opposed to all people.
Self-praise and criticism of others is indeed shameful for the virtuous.
The scholarship of the hypocrites indeed flourishes only among the ignorant masses.

The one who is worthy of being compared to the moon, whose eyes are pleasing to the senses, whose body shines like the sun, whose character is pure and inspires awe in people, who has endured twenty-two types of hardships and has a strong resolve, whose wisdom is renowned throughout the world, who has defeated his opponents and whose fame has spread far and wide, who has delved deep into the scriptures and whose teachings are sweet and nourishing, like honey and milk, and who has the ability to enlighten even the most skeptical minds.  

Such are the extraordinary qualities of Hemachandracharya. His complexion was as radiant as gold, his face had the coolness of the moon, his eyes were as beautiful as lotuses, and his body radiated a brilliance that filled people with joy. He was a celibate from a young age, and his pure character inspired wonder in everyone. He had the strength to endure twenty-two types of hardships and had a strong resolve due to his intense austerities. His intellect was world-renowned, and he had defeated his opponents. His fame spread far and wide. He had a deep understanding of the scriptures and his teachings were sweet and nourishing, like honey and milk, and had the power to enlighten even the most skeptical minds.

Seeing these extraordinary qualities in Hemachandracharya, even the most intelligent person would believe that they have never seen such a great soul, even among the disciples of the Tirthankaras. Yet, in ancient times, such great beings must have existed and their presence must have filled the world with fragrance.

## Yogaśālā: A Contemplation

In Jainism, **Samyagdarshan**, **Samyagjnana**, and **Samyakcharitra** are considered essential for attaining liberation (Moksha). The harmonious combination of these three is called the path to liberation or the means to liberation (Mokshamarg or Mokshaupaya). As Shri Hemchandracharya has said in the 'Abhidhanachintamani-kosha', "Mokshaupayo yogo jnanashraddhanacharanatmakah", meaning - the three yogas of knowledge, vision, and conduct are the means to liberation. Vedic Dharma has referred to these same three as **Jnanyoga**, **Karmayoga**, and **Bhaktiyoga**. Yogaśāstra provides a comprehensive description of these three.

Yogaśāstra has a total of 12 chapters (Prakash). There are 1012 verses in total, and there is a self-composed commentary of 12750 verses by the revered Shri Hemchandracharya, the omniscient of the Kali Yuga. The first three chapters describe the **Yoga-vidyamanya** (knowledge of yoga), **Yama** (restraint), and **Niyama** (observance), which are the two limbs of the aforementioned three yogas, explained from a Jain perspective. The fourth chapter elaborates on **Atmaswaroop-raman** (contemplation of the self), **victory over passions and objects**, **purification of the mind**, **control of senses**, **conquest of the mind**, **equanimity**, **meditation**, **twelve reflections (Anupreksha)**, **four emotions (Maitri, etc.)**, and **asanas** for the union of the soul with the Supreme Soul. The fifth chapter describes **Pranayama** (breath control), **purification of the mind**, the nature of the **five vital breaths (Panchpran)**, **conquest of the breath**, **concentrations (Dharana)**, the four related **mandalas**, and the knowledge of **favorable and unfavorable**, **life and death**, etc., through **pranavayu** (vital breath), as well as **time knowledge (Kalajnana)** through **instruments, mantras, knowledge, auspicious time, shadow, and whispers**, **purification of the nadis**, and **entering other bodies (Parakayapravesh)**. The sixth chapter discusses **pratyahara** (withdrawal of senses) and **dharana**, while the seventh chapter provides insight into the **four aims of meditation (Pindastha, etc.)** and the **five concentrations (Parthavi, etc.)**. The eighth chapter briefly describes the nature and method of meditation corresponding to the **padastha-dhyeya** (meditation on the feet). Subsequently, the ninth chapter discusses **rupastahdhyana** (meditation on form), and the tenth chapter discusses **rupaatita** (meditation beyond form). Then, the eleventh and twelfth chapters provide an unparalleled description of **Dharmadhyana** (meditation on Dharma), **Shukladhyana** (meditation on purity), **Nirvikalpaka Samadhi** (meditation without thought), **Moksha** (liberation), and **types of mind**, including all the steps.

It must be said that the revered Acharya Shri has shifted Indian yoga practices away from the complex physical processes of **Hatha Yoga**, etc., and towards the **self-contemplation** (Atma-chintandhara) approach, connecting it to the processes of **Sahaj Yoga** (natural yoga) or **Jivan Yoga** (life yoga). This is the unique feature of this Yogaśāstra compared to the 'Yoga Darshan' and other texts written by Patanjali and other yogis, where they have limited yoga to the eight limbs of **Yama-Niyama**, etc., for all beings, starting with **control of mental fluctuations (Chittavrittinirodha)**. However, Shri Hemchandracharya, the omniscient of the Kali Yuga, has presented a beautiful sequence of **knowledge-vision-conduct** (Jnana-Darshan-Charitra) yoga practices to reach from the **path-follower (Marganusari)** to the **householder-devotee-religion (Grihastha-Shravak-Dharma)**, **saintly religion (Sadhudharma)**, and other higher spiritual realms, elaborating on **Dharma-Shukladhyana**, **control of senses-passions-mind**, **equanimity**, **twelve reflections**, **four emotions**, etc., to help the soul become the Supreme Soul. The subject matter is explained well with interesting examples, making the description easily understandable. Acharya Shri has bound the verses of Yogaśāstra with **Anushtup** meters, describing yoga in a simple, clear, and understandable style. The description of the **greatness of yoga**, its **dignity**, the **fruits of its practice**, and its **miracles** at the beginning is so lively and engaging that every inquisitive seeker can be attracted to yoga practice, eager to devote their precious life and dedicate themselves accordingly. Truly, Yogaśāstra is like an ocean of meaning, a vigilant guardian of the soul like the Himalayas, an Upanishad of spirituality, an inexhaustible treasure of self-knowledge, a divine treasure chest of self-virtue; it is a guide to self-realization of the highest order for the life of a seeker; it leaves no aspect of self-practice untouched. It provides a comprehensive discussion of the processes of practicing the body, mind, and senses bound to the soul. Acharya Shri has introduced his omniscience and extraordinary brilliance by adopting a style that is often based on personal experience, rather than the traditional style in terms of emotion, language, and compilation. The twelve chapters of this work guide the lifeboat of the seeker of liberation (Mumukshu) and the seeker of self (Atmarthi), or the inquisitive, devout devotee (Dharmbhiru Shravak), through the storms of worldly subjects, the turbulent waves of unfavorable events, and the roars of the material world, rising in the vast ocean of life and the world.

A beacon of great light, guiding towards the truth and preventing collisions; it was instrumental in helping him reach the shores of liberation.
This vast collection of scriptures was created by the grace of the Chalukya dynasty's jewel, the supreme sage, Sri Kumarapala, the king. The king was very curious about the science of yoga; he had recited many scriptures on the yoga science of that time, but his mind was not satisfied. Therefore, Acharya Shri, due to the intense request of King Kumarapala, composed this science of yoga. | By studying this collection of scriptures daily, the king became an expert in the science of yoga from the Jain perspective.
The revered Acharya Shri played a huge role in making Gujarat a place of non-violence and righteousness. King Kumarapala was your devoted follower, yet you did not ask him for any favors for your comfort. Your talent was multifaceted. Poetry, meter, rhetoric, grammar, ethics, yoga, history, lexicon, logic, hymns, devotion, evidence, etc. | You did not leave any subject untouched, on which you did not wield your pen. Yoga Shastra, Svopjnavritti, Dwayashraya Kavya, Abhidhanachintamani, Pramanamimamsa, Anekarthasangraha, Trishatishalakapurushcharitra, Siddhahemashabdanusasan, Linganusasan, Chhandanusasan, Kavyanusasan, Mahadevastotra, Anyayogavyavchhedhika (stotra), Ayogavyavchhedhika, Vitragastotra, Prakritvyakaran, Haimdhaatuprayan, etc. are your vast scriptures. In this way, along with the pursuit of self-welfare, your literary pursuit was also unmatched.
Your guru was Acharya Shri Devchandrasuri. Once, while wandering, Acharya Shri visited Dhundhuka. To listen to his nectar-like words, Pahini (Hemachandracharya's mother) also came to the shelter with her son Changdev (Acharya Shri's name in the householder stage). Acharya Shri Devchandrasuriji, seeing Changdev's unique appearance, characteristics, and actions, predicted that he would become the savior of the community in the future, becoming proficient in all scriptures and a benefactor of self-welfare, and made a special request to his mother to hand him over. The mother initially hesitated; but understanding it as a supreme favor, she happily handed over Changdev. Later, his father, Shri Chaching Seth (Modhvanik), reached Kर्णपुरी near Acharya Shri. After much debate with Acharya Shri, impressed by him, Chaching Seth happily gave his permission to initiate Changdev. At the age of about 8-9, in Vikram Samvat 1154, Changdev was initiated by his guru, and named Somdev. By the grace of his guru, Somdev Muni became proficient in all scriptures. Seeing his competence, Acharya Shri Devchandrasuri, in Samvat 1166, | gave Somdev Muni the position of Acharya at the age of 21, and named him Hemachandracharya.
After becoming an Acharya, Hemachandracharya gave a new turn to the politics of Gujarat. The then king of Gujarat, Siddha Raj Jaisingh, wanted to make Kumarapala his successor. One reason behind this was that Kumarapala
was indebted to Acharya Shri's favors, secondly, he wanted to carry out the work of non-violence in Gujarat; thirdly, he wanted to spread the principles of Jainism among the people of Gujarat. The credit for making King Kumarapala a Shaiva devotee and a righteous person goes to Acharya Shri.
Acharya Shri, from time to time, gave religious inspiration to King Kumarapala, and saved him from going on the path of irreligion. Impressed by Acharya Shri's vast literary creation, King Kumarapala and the contemporary learned listeners and kings | bestowed upon him the title of 'Kalikalasarvjna'.
Acharya Shri's literary creation has made him immortal. I am fascinated by many of Acharya Shri's works. I read the Yoga Shastra written by you. Seeing its vast Svopjnavritti, I was inspired that why not, present this Yoga Shastra with a vast explanation in Hindi translation; so that the common people can benefit from the experienced words of Pujya Acharya Shri Maharaj. In the courage of my Hindi translation, I got the opportunity of the learned coordinator thinker Muni Shri Nemichandraji Maharaj. With his help in the revision and editing of this book, I | was able to present this Yoga Shastra to the discerning readers along with the Hindi translation. If any principle-contradictory statement has been written in the translation due to a visual defect, carelessness, then the discerning reader will forgive me. If any noble person suggests any mistake to me, I will gladly accept it.
_ I hope that the religious readers will benefit from this collection of scriptures and develop themselves; with this good wish,

_ "Special Details" In the Gujarati translation of Yogashastra, in the explanation of Samayik, under the third light 82-83 verses, on page no. 210 of Hindi, after the explanation of the word Voshirami, the translator has given the following special explanation in the Gujarati translation:
While doing Samayik, the soul's sinful past cycle is abandoned and the new cycle of the soul, which is full of knowledge, vision and character, is born, so it can be said that the past cycle soul has been abandoned. Because cycles are different states of the soul that appear gradually, and the cycle is the basis of those states, the soul. Because these cycles and the cycle-maker are different, I am different from my soul. It is not false to say that I am newly born.
In Acharang Sutra it is said that Aayakhalu Samaiyan, that is, the soul is Samayik. The meaning is that just as Samayik is one cycle of the soul and the soul is somehow inseparable from its cycle, so the soul is called Samayik. Similarly, here, considering the difference of cycles, I am Voshiravam from my soul, what is this? The meaning is that I am Voshiravam from my sinful past cycle.

## Introduction

In scriptures, attaining human birth is said to be extremely rare. While the state of being a god is considered abundant with happiness and material possessions, it is not considered rare. However, human birth is considered rare because it is the only path to the highest state - liberation (moksha). This birth allows for the attainment of all stages of self-development and virtues. Gods and hell beings cannot progress beyond the four and five stages of virtues respectively. They lack the means for wisdom, penance, sacrifice, and self-improvement. Hell beings are bound by the suffering caused by their actions and karmic seeds, leaving no room for self-improvement. The state of being a hell being is a life of dependence and devoid of wisdom. This makes their state of self-development inferior. Human birth is the only birth where all possibilities for favorable conditions exist.

Even in human birth, due to the influence of environment and karmic impressions, there are many obstacles to self-development. Extremely hot regions, forests, mountainous areas, coastal regions, and islands all have their own unique challenges in terms of food, shelter, and lifestyle, making self-development a distant thought. These areas devoid of self-development are called "Anarya" regions in scriptures.

Attaining human birth is one of the rarest things in life. Similarly, a region where the principles of religion and ethics are prevalent, and the environment is conducive to self-development, is called an "Arya" region. Attaining such a region is also one of the rarest things in life. India is an Arya region. From its forests, mountains, valleys, villages, and cities, one can see the influence of religion and ethics in every aspect. The worship of the Supreme Being, fear of the afterlife, the impermanence of human life, and the worship of any principle worthy of worship are deeply ingrained in every corner of India. Every village, forest, and mountain in India expresses its impermanence through songs, stones, trees, and the application of vermillion, and worships deities.

For millions of years, this land has been immersed in religious principles. Saints, ascetics, and powerful individuals have left their mark on every corner of this land, ensuring the continuation of these principles. This is why India has always been the land of saints. Kings, emperors, merchants, and scholars, despite enjoying all the comforts of life, have always pondered the afterlife. This is why India has produced many kings who renounced their kingdoms and sought refuge in the forest. It has produced many merchants who donated their millions of wealth. It has produced many scholars who traveled far and wide in search of truth. India is not just concerned with material happiness but also with the pursuit of spiritual happiness.

This pursuit of spiritual happiness has led to the emergence of many religions in India. Each religion has established its own principles and created a framework for conduct and thought.

The classification of these diverse religions and thoughts is called "Shatdarshan" (Six Schools of Philosophy). The synthesis of these six schools of philosophy, or the synthesis of all religions, is Jainism. This is why Anandghanji Maharaj, in his praise of Lord Naminath, says that all philosophies are encompassed within Jainism. This synthesis is evident in the three verses "Uppenna E Va, Vigame E Va, Dhume E Va" spoken by Lord Mahavira, which were expanded upon by Ganadhar Bhagwan in the form of "Dwadashanga" (Twelve Angas).

These twelve Angas are divided into four "Anuyog" (Categories): Dravyanuyog, Ganitanuyog, Kathanyog, and Charan-Karananuyog.

Dravyanuyog deals with the nature of karma, its classification, bondage, emergence, liberation, existence, causes, and other subtle aspects of the six substances.

The measurement and quantity of various places like Devavimanas, Jyotishchakra, Narakavasa, Dweesha, Samudra, Parvata etc. in the fourteen Rajalokas are considered through Ganitanuyog.
The detailed explanation of stories that destroy eternal sins and lead the soul to the path of salvation is called Kathanyog.
The consideration of the qualities of the path of conduct, the various practices of life, the detailed explanation of Charan Sittari and Karan Sittari, starting from Sarva Virati and Deshvirati is called Charan Karananyog.
These four Anuyogs are called Dwadashangi and the Dwadashangi gradually becomes thinner and thinner. The Agam Shruti that we have today is also based on these four Anuyogs.
Following the Agam Shruti, our ancestors and authorities have created various types of literature. All this literature is also based on the four Anuyogs.
The fruit of these four Anuyogs is Moksha. Dravyanyog, Ganitanuyog and Kathanyog are the three Anuyogs that are part of Charan Karananyog.
Yogshastra is the reference point for Charan Karananyog. The main focus is on Charan Karananyog. However, this Yogshastra also refers to the other three Anuyogs. The knowledge of the division of Karma, the nature of Gunasthan etc. is explained through Dravyanyog, the nature of the fourteen Rajalokas etc. is explained through Ganitanuyog and detailed stories are used to explain each vow and its related topics through Kathanyog. The fruit of Charan Karananyog is knowledge, vision and character. The combination of these three is called Yoga.
This is what the omniscient Hemchandrasuri Maharaj has said in the latter half of the 15th verse of the first Prakashana:
"Knowledge, faith and character are the three jewels." This Yoga is in the form of the three jewels of knowledge, vision and character. Therefore, this Yogshastra describes knowledge, vision and character in detail. The description of knowledge is given in the 16th verse of the first Prakashana.
"The understanding of the true nature of things, whether in brief or in detail, is called right knowledge by the wise." The nature of vision and character is explained in the 70th and 18th verses of the first Prakashana.
The explanation of character is given from the 19th to the 46th verse of the first Prakashana, explaining the nature of the five great vows, the five samitis and the three secrets.
"This character is said to be the best for all the great sages and for the householders who are attached to the duties of a sage." The character of Deshvirati is for those who are attached to the duties of a sage and for the householders who are attached to the duties of a sage.
To explain how a householder can become a Dharmaadhikari with this Deshvirati character, the 35 qualities of the path of conduct are described in the 47th to 56th verses of the first Prakashana, completing the first Prakashana.
This is actually the introduction to the first Prakashana. In the second Prakashana, Yoga is called "knowledge, faith and character." The other parts are explained there.

- Mafatlal Jhaverchand Gandhi.
"Special Details" - It is also not permissible to engage in other businesses such as: extracting the heart, testicles, or kidneys of living beings; extracting fish oil; making medicines from the blood of animals; performing abortions; using birth control methods; selling such devices; selling cremation materials; selling pesticides; spraying phenyls; killing rats, monkeys, dogs, etc.; running slaughterhouses; earning money through cinema, drama, etc.; selling TVs, TV parts, etc.; carrying out executions; selling or making violent medicines; and other similar businesses.
These acts of violence fall under the category of Karmadan, both in the context of the first vow and as a means of livelihood.
This treatise on Yoga, in the third chapter, verse 111, provides a Gujarati translation of this meter, which is useful and therefore included here. - [This image is special because: not bathing, abstaining from all four types of food at night, keeping the dhoti loose, observing complete celibacy on the four festival days, and limiting it on other days, meditating on Jineshwar in Kaussag, and mentally condemning lust and enjoyment for five months] (This meter is found in the fifth image in the Gujarati translation).

**Meaning:**

**The Greatness of Yoga**

Yoga is a sharp axe that cuts down all the vines of misfortune, and it is a herb that subdues the goddess of liberation, free from any mantras or tantras, and a charm that conquers karma.  Just as a fierce wind scatters a dense array of clouds, so too does yoga destroy many sins.  Just as a blazing fire consumes fuel accumulated over a long time in an instant, so too does yoga destroy sins accumulated over many lifetimes in an instant.  For a yogi, phlegm, mucus, excrement, touch, and all other medicinal properties are great wealth, and the ability to know the objects of all senses through one sense is a miracle of yoga practice.  Similarly, the wealth of knowledge of the fourfold path, the ability to acquire poison and its antidote, the knowledge of the future, and the ability to know the thoughts of others are the blossoming flowers of the wish-fulfilling tree of yoga.  Indeed, how great is the power of yoga that even while bearing the responsibility of a vast empire, the king of the Bharata land, Bharata Chakravarti, attained omniscience.  For those who have committed the great sins of killing a Brahmin, a woman, a fetus, or a cow, and who are like guests of hell, and for those who are strong and powerful, yoga is the only support.  Of the four goals of life - dharma, artha, kama, and moksha - moksha is the foremost, and yoga is the cause of its attainment.  It is composed of the three jewels of right knowledge, right faith, and right conduct.

**Meaning**
;
**Intention:** Kalikalasarvagna Shrimad Hemachandracharya, while composing this Yogashastra, states the purpose of writing his own commentary on it with the mangalacharan - 'Swayogashastraarth - Visheshnirnayoh Bhavyavabodhaaya Maya Vidhasyate', meaning, 'I am writing this commentary (tika) to give the true meaning of my Yogashastra to the worthy beings.' So that no one can interpret it arbitrarily with their own intellect and mislead the inquisitive people. Inspired by this intention, Shri Hemachandracharya has written a commentary on his own work.

**Commentary:** In the first verse of Mahavira - Yogashastra, the word 'Mahavira' is the special. The meaning of Mahavira is - greater than the heroes. A warrior who defeats thousands of soldiers in battle is not truly called a hero. A hero, in the true sense, is one who 'destroys (defeats) the enemies of karma in a special way'. Or, one who is strong and enthusiastic in penance by destroying karma, is called a hero. This is the definition of the word 'veer' from the point of view of characteristics or etymology. But Bhagwan Vardhaman was even more heroic than other heroes. How did Bhagwan become famous as Mahavira? In this regard, we present a special incident from his life here.

**The title of Mahavira bestowed by Indra:**
When the birth festival of the infant (Bhagwan) Mahavira was being celebrated, Indra (who had arrived a short time earlier) had a doubt in his mind - how will this small child Vardhaman bear the weight of the water that will be poured on his body during the coronation? The infant Vardhaman, by his physical strength, increased his mental strength, and to dispel Indra's aforementioned doubt, as soon as he touched Mount Sumeru with the big toe of his right foot, the peak of Mount Sumeru and the earth began to tremble, the sea also became agitated; the entire universe was terrified. At that time, Indra

##  A Hymn to Mahavira Embodied with Four Atishayas

The first verse of the hymn, using the knowledge of Avadhigyan, recognizes the extraordinary power of the Lord's self-strength. Impressed by this, Indra bestowed the title of Mahavira upon Lord Vardhaman at that very moment. Other reasons for receiving the name Mahavira: _ The immense capacity to uproot the karmas bound as knots and smooth in countless births, and the effort to achieve this, are also reasons for the title Mahavira. His parents named him Vardhaman. Others addressed him as 'Shraman' and 'Devarya'.

Thus, the purpose of bowing down to Mahavira is explained here.

The four epithets - 'Durvara Ragādi-Vairivar Nivarinē', 'Arhate', 'Yogināthāya', and 'Tāyinē' - reveal the four well-known Atishayas of the Tirthankara Mahavira. These four Atishayas are: 1. Apayapagamātishaya, 2. Pūjātishaya, 3. Jñānātishaya, and 4. Vachanātishaya. Apaya refers to obstacles, hindrances. Raga, Dvesha, Kama, Krodha, etc., are obstacles in the practice of Vitaragata. By removing these obstacles in the form of enemies like Raga, etc., the Lord's self-nature manifests as Apayapagamātishaya. Therefore, the first epithet 'Durvara Ragādi-Vairivar-Nivarinē' for Lord Mahavira is meaningful.

• By destroying the enemies like Raga, Dvesha, etc., the Lord attained the Arihant state; for this reason, he became worthy of worship (Arhat) by all gods, Asuras, and humans. Therefore, the second epithet 'Arhate' signifies the Lord's Pūjātishaya.

By the power of pure Kevalgyan, the Lord is the master of all Yogis, being the complete knower of the nature of the Lokaloka and the welfare of all beings. Therefore, the epithet 'Yogināthāya' reveals his Jñānātishaya.

The Lord delivers his nectar-like sermons for the protection of all beings in the world, and through this, all beings in the world receive the gift of fearlessness. In this form, the Lord's Vachanātishaya is evident. Therefore, his fourth epithet 'Tāyinē' (protector) is also meaningful. All beings understand the sermons of the Tirthankara Mahavira in their own language. This is why, through his all-being-touching sermons (Dharmopadeśa), the Lord shows the way for beings in the world to escape birth, old age, death, etc., and truly protects their souls. Therefore, he is the true protector, nourisher, and guardian of the entire world. Even lions, tigers, etc., protect and nurture their young, but that nurturing is filled with attachment. The Lord's nurturing and protection of all beings is free from attachment, selfless.

Thus, by describing the four Atishayas, the hymn praises the ultimate truth of Lord Mahavira. Now, the hymn praises the Lord Mahavira, who is embodied with Yoga.

**Verse 2:**

**Pannāge cha Surendre cha, Kaushike Pādasansprishi | Nirvisheshmanaskaaya, Shreeviraswamine Namah ||2||**

**Meaning:** My salutations to Lord Mahavira, who has the same mind (equanimity) towards both Surendra (Kaushika) who touched his feet with devotion and the Kaushika serpent who touched his feet with the intention of biting.

**Explanation:** In his previous birth, Chandakoushika was named Kaushika. When Lord Mahavira enlightened him, he said, 'Chandakoushika, attain enlightenment, awaken.' Indra's other name is also Kaushika. The Kaushika serpent touched the Lord's feet with the intention of biting, and Kaushika Indra touched his feet with devotion. The Lord had neither hatred for the Chandakoushika serpent nor attachment for Indra; he was free from attachment and hatred towards both, and he was equanimous.

**Note:** Other texts mention 17 names of the Lord: 1. Jnatakuloutpanna, 2. Videh, 3. Videhdatt, 4. Videhjatya, 5. Videh Sukumal, 6. Sanmati, 7. Mahateevir, 8. Mahavira, 9. Antya Kashyap, 10. Veer, 11. Devarya, 12. Jnatānwaya, 13. Jnatānandan, 14. Nataputra, 15. Vardhaman, 16. Nayaputta, 17. Charam Tirthankara.

Praise of the Lord by Indra through the Shakrastava

The first chapter of the Yoga Shastra, verses 1-2, were like this. My salutations to such an impartial, valiant Lord. The impartiality of Lord Mahavira is explained through the events of his life. The equality of Mahavira in various situations:

The pure soul, Mahavira Deva, due to the Tīrthankara karma acquired in a previous birth, fell from the Pushpottar Vimana of the Pranat Devaloka and was born in the house of King Siddhartha, like a swan in a lake, with three kinds of knowledge. He was born in the womb of Queen Trishala Devi.

At that time, due to the influence of the excellent womb, Trishala Devi saw 14 great dreams in sequence: 1. Lion, 2. Elephant, 3. Bull, 4. Lakshmi Devi adorned with abhisheka, 5. Garland of flowers, 6. Moon, 7. Sun, 8. Indra flag, 9. Full pot, 10. Lotus lake, 11. Ocean, 12. Divine aircraft, 13. Treasure of jewels, and 14. Smokeless fire. After that, on a day filled with auspicious yogas, the Lord was born, who illuminates the three worlds, shakes the seats of gods and demons, and makes even the beings in hell and the animal realm experience happiness for a moment.

At that time, fifty-six Dikumaris performed the Sutika karma. Afterwards, Saudharmendra took the Lord to the peak of Mount Meru to perform the Janmabhisheka. He sat on the throne, holding the Jagadguru Prabhu in his lap. At that time, Indra, whose heart was softened by devotion, had a doubt: How could the Lord bear the weight of so much water? To dispel this doubt, the Lord simply pressed Mount Meru with the big toe of his right foot. The peak of the mountain began to bend as if bowing to the Lord. Or, all those mountains moved as if they wanted to come to the Lord. The ocean began to surge as if it wanted to perform a bath festival. The earth suddenly trembled as if preparing to dance.

"What happened?" Thinking this, Indra used his Avadhijnana and, knowing the power of the Lord's inner strength compared to his physical strength, said to the Lord, "Swamin! How can a simple person like me know your great influence? Therefore, I apologize for my contrary thoughts." Saying this, he bowed to the Lord. Then, joyful music began to play. On the other hand, all the Indras together performed the abhisheka festival of the Lord with fragrant water from holy pilgrimages. The gods, the Asuras, and the Bhavanapati Devas repeatedly poured this abhisheka water on their heads and sprinkled it on everyone. Even the earth touched by the Lord's bath water became worthy of worship; because even a small person gains glory from the company of great souls. Afterwards, Saudharmendra placed the Lord in the lap of Ishaneindra (in the form of a bull), had him bathed, performed eight types of worship, offered aarti, and praised him.

O (future) Arihant Bhagavan! Self-enlightened, Brahma, Tīrthankara, the originator of Dharma, the best among all men, I bow to you. O illuminator of the world, the one who illuminates the world, the best in the world, the master of the world, the one who benefits the beings of the world, I bow to you. The best among men, the one who gives happiness like a lotus flower, the one who is like a lion among men, the one who is like a unique fragrant elephant among men, Prabhu! I bow to you. The giver of the eye of Shruta Jnana. The one who removes fear! The one who gives Samyaktva, the one who shows the path to liberation, the one who gives Dharma, the one who preaches Dharma, the one who gives refuge to frightened beings, I bow to you. O charioteer of Dharma! The one who inspires Dharma, the best emperor of Dharma, free from hypocrisy, the one who holds Samyag Jnana Darshan, the one who conquers the enemies of raga, etc., and conquers other beings, the one who crosses the ocean of the world and saves other beings, the one who is free from the bonds of karma himself and liberates others, the one who has attained enlightenment himself and enlightens others, I bow to you. O Omniscient! O Lord! The one who knows and sees all things, the one who possesses the power of excess, the one who pulverizes the eight karmas, O Bhagavan! I bow to you.

Indra's praise in the assembly of gods, a god coming to test a god, initiation.
Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verses 1-2.  Reverend, greater than even the great men, the teacher of teachers, the elder of elders, O Lord! Greetings to you.  Filled with the universe by pure knowledge, the master of yogis, the holder of yoga, self-pure and purifier of others, the unsurpassed supreme person! Greetings to you.  Yoga Acharya, the one who purifies the soul by removing karma, the best, the foremost, the master of speech, the auspicious one, O Lord! Greetings to you.  The first to rise, the unparalleled hero!  Worthy of praise with words like Surya Stuti (Om Bhurbhuvah Svah), O Lord, greetings to you.  Benefactor of all beings, achiever of all purposes, attaining immortality, the rising sun, the holder of celibacy, the one who crosses the ocean of the world, skillful, unchanging, protector of the world, with a body endowed with Vajra Rishabha Narachasanahanan, the seer of the true reality! Greetings to you.  The one who is present in all three times, Jinenndra, self-born, endowed with knowledge, strength, vigor, brilliance, power, and wealth, O Lord! Greetings to you.  The original person of Dharma, the Supreme Lord, the Great God, the embodiment of the light principle, O Master! Greetings to you.  Like the moon to the ocean of the lineage of King Siddhartha, the master of the three worlds! Lord Sri Mahavira Prabhu! Greetings to you.

Indra, with this kind of praise, greeted the Lord and took him back to his mother.  The Lord's parents, due to the increase of wealth and grain in their house, named him 'Vardhaman' accordingly.  There was a competition among the gods and demons to serve and worship the Lord.  Watering the earth with nectar-showering eyes, growing with a thousand and eight natural qualities, the Lord also grew with age.  Once, the unparalleled strong Vardhaman, due to his childhood, went to play with his peers, the princes.  At that time, Indra, knowing by his knowledge of perception, praised in the assembly of gods, "There is no hero greater than Mahavira Prabhu in the whole world."  An envious god was angered by this and took it upon himself to distract Vardhaman.  He went straight to where the boy Vardhaman was playing the game of Amlaki with his peers.  The god, deceitfully, took the form of a serpent and clung to the tree.  Seeing that terrible serpent, all the princes ran here and there in fear.  But Vardhaman, laughing, caught the snake like a rope and threw it on the ground.  The ashamed princes came back to play.  The god then took the form of a young man and came there again.  All the boys climbed the tree.  Vardhaman had already climbed to the top of the tree.  For the one who is going to the highest state (moksha), climbing to the top of a tree is no big deal!  Vardhaman, already sitting on the peak, was shining like the sun on the peak of Mount Meru.  While the other princes looked like monkeys hanging on the branches.  Later, Vardhaman set a condition in the game that whoever wins will ride on the back of the loser.  The victorious Vardhaman prince also rode on the backs of the princes like a horseman.  Gradually, the mighty victorious Vardhaman sat on the back of the god.  That evil-minded god, taking the form of a terrible Vetala who could defeat even mountains, began to grow tall, making a mouth like the netherworld, showing a tongue like a serpent.  And the long yellow hair on his head, like a mountain, appeared like a wildfire.  His terrible beard appeared like a sickle.  His nostrils appeared like the cave of a huge mountain.  Frowning, his terrible eyebrows appeared like two she-snakes.  Climbing like a palm tree, that god did not stop; then the mighty Lord punched him on his back and made him a dwarf.  Thus, experiencing firsthand the patience of Vardhaman, as described by Indra, the god appeared in his original form and, greeting the Lord, returned to his place.  One day, Vardhaman Mahavira's parents were preparing to send him to school after celebrating his Vidyaarambh festival.  Knowing this, Indra thought, 'Should the omniscient one also become a student of a school?'  Thinking this, Indra himself came there in the form of a Brahmin and, seating Vardhaman on the teacher's seat, greeted him and requested the Lord to speak on the science of words.  The eloquent and omniscient Mahavira discussed the science of grammar.

## The Prefix of the Cowherd

The first chapter of the Yoga Shastra, "First Light," states that the text became known as "Aindra Vyakaran" (Aindra Grammar) because Lord Mahavira instructed Indra in the art of language.

Despite his yearning for initiation, the Lord remained in his home for twenty-eight years, respecting his parents' wishes. After their passing, he expressed his desire to renounce worldly possessions and take monastic vows. His elder brother, Nandivardhan, pleaded with him, "Brother, I am alone and unable to bear the fresh grief of our parents' loss. Your presence provides me great comfort. Please do not speak such words, like sprinkling salt on a fresh wound." He tried to dissuade the Lord from taking initiation, but during this time, the Lord remained in Kayotsarga (meditation) even amidst the opulent surroundings of his palace, adorned with various ornaments and jewels. He maintained the conduct of a monk, consuming only uncooked food and water, adhering to the principles of a Sadhu's conduct. In this way, the Lord, with his vast aspirations, spent a year.

Then, the Lokantik Devas (celestial beings) approached the Lord, bowing down and saying, "Lord, the time for your initiation is near. Prepare yourself and establish a Tirtha (sacred place)."

Knowing his initiation was imminent, Lord Mahavira began to generously donate to the needy for a year. He considered the earth to be free from debt and renounced worldly wealth, equating it to a mere straw. In the second year, he relinquished all possessions. All the celestial beings of the various realms celebrated his initiation. A thousand Devas carried a palanquin named Chandra Prabha (Moon Light). The Lord sat within it and arrived at the garden known as Jnatrikhand. There, he renounced all worldly activities (pravrittis) and took initiation at the fourth watch of the day. At that moment, the Lord attained the fourth stage of knowledge, Manahparyaya Jnana (knowledge of the thoughts of all beings).

From there, the Lord continued his journey and stood in Kayotsarga, unwavering like Mount Meru, outside Kumaragram at dusk. That night, a cowherd, filled with unprovoked anger, became an enemy of the Lord and inflicted an Upasarg (severe affliction) upon him. Indra, with his Avadhi Jnana (clairvoyance), perceived the potential for increased suffering upon the Lord. He thought, "Just as a mouse attempts to dig through a great mountain, this wicked cowherd seeks to inflict harm upon the Lord." Driven by his devotion to the Lord's well-being, Indra appeared at the Lord's feet. The cowherd, like a bedbug, fled in fear. Indra circumambulated the Lord thrice, bowed his head in reverence, and prayed, "Lord, for twelve years, you will face a barrage of afflictions. I wish to remain at your feet and try to prevent these hardships."

Having completed his Kayotsarga, the Lord said to Indra, "Indra, an Arihant (liberated soul) never expects assistance from others."

Thereafter, the Lord Mahavira, with a coolness like the moon, a brilliance like the sun, a fiery intensity that could be seen with sorrow, a strength like an elephant, an unshakeable resolve like Mount Meru, an endurance like the earth, a depth like the ocean, a fearlessness like a lion, a fierce fire for the misguided, a solitary nature like a rhinoceros' horn, a strength like a great bull, controlled senses like a tortoise, a solitary vision like a serpent, a purity like a conch, a beautiful form like gold, a free flight like a bird, an uninterrupted movement like consciousness, a supportless nature like the sky, an unwavering focus like a Bharand bird, a detachment like a lotus leaf, with equanimity towards enemies and friends, grass and kingdom, gold and stone, jewel and dirt, this world and the next, pleasure and pain, the world and liberation, all things; with selfless compassion, ready to help; with mental strength, a savior of beings drowning in the ocean of existence, seeking their own liberation; unattached like the wind; the Jagadguru (world teacher) Mahavira, adorned with the ocean-like Karadhani (a type of garment), began to wander across the earth, adorned with numerous villages, cities, and forests.

While wandering, he once reached the southern region of Jabal. From there, he was traveling towards the city of Shwetaambika. On the way, some cowherds said, "O Devaraya! This path is indeed straight to Shwetaambika, but in between lies the deserted hermitage of Kanak Khal, a tapasvi (ascetic). There, a venomous serpent..."

The story of the Chanda-Koushika serpent and its awakening and its equality

The first light of the Yoga Shastra, verse 1-2, says that it remains like a snake. There, no animal, bird, human or any creature can go safe. Therefore, you should leave this path and go by this slightly winding path. The proverb says, "What is the use of wearing gold that cuts the ears?" The Lord, diving into his self-knowledge, knew that the serpent was none other than the ascetic sage of his previous birth, who was going for alms, when his foot fell on a frog, killing it. A small sage asked him to criticize his fault and also showed him the dead frog. But instead of criticizing his mistake, the ascetic sage started telling the dead frogs by saying, "Oh! Wicked, insignificant Muni! Tell me, did I kill all these frogs?" The pure-minded, young Muni did not answer anything and assumed that even if this great man does not accept it now, he will surely take atonement by criticizing it in the evening. But in the evening, at the time of Pratikraman, the Muni sat down without criticizing and taking atonement. Then the young Muni thought that he seems to have forgotten the matter of the frog's contradiction. To remind him of this matter, he said, "Muni! Why don't you criticize and atone for the contradiction of that frog?" As soon as he said this, the ascetic sage, filled with anger, ran to kill the young Muni. Due to extreme anger, the ascetic sage collided with the pillar and died there. Due to the contradiction of Sadhutva, he was born in the Jyotishka Devaloka. From there, he was born as a son named Koushika from the wife of the head of the five hundred tapaswis in the Kanakakhal ashram. There were many other sages living there who belonged to the Koushika gotra. But this Koushika was very angry, so people named him Chanda-Koushika. After the death of his father, Chanda-Koushika became the head. This head used to roam in the forest day and night due to his attachment to the forest. And he did not allow anyone to take flowers, fruits, roots, leaves etc. from this forest. If anyone took even the destroyed useless fruits etc., he would beat him with wood, stone, stone, axe etc. Therefore, the tapaswis started getting very sad due to not getting fruits etc. Just as crows fly away when stones are thrown, similarly those tapaswis, tired of the atrocities of this Koushika, went in different directions.
One day this Chanda-Koushika went out of the ashram to take thorny bushes. From behind, many princes from the Shwetaambari city came and destroyed his ashram and garden. Koushika was returning with thorns when the cowherds told him, "Today someone is destroying your garden! Go quickly and take care of it!" Just as fire flares up with ghee, similarly, he became extremely angry with anger and ran to kill them with a sharp-edged axe. Just as other birds flee in fear of the hawk, similarly, those princes also ran away seeing Chanda-Koushika coming with an axe. The ascetic was running wildly when, due to not being aware in anger, he suddenly fell into a deep well, like the mouth of Yama. While falling, the axe he was holding in his hand came in front of his face and its edge got stuck in his head and his head burst. It is true, "The fruits of the deeds done have to be enjoyed!" The same Chanda-Koushika ascetic died and became a very angry, vision-poisoning serpent in this forest. In fact, intense, endless anger goes with you in other births as well. But 'he will surely attain enlightenment.' Thinking this, the world-loving Lord, not considering his suffering as suffering, went on the same path to alleviate the suffering of the serpent's birth-wandering. The forest was rough and desolate due to the lack of human traffic. The water of the small river there became sandy and muddy due to not being drunk. The trees there had become stumps, their leaves had dried up. Termites had built their mounds on the trees at various places. The huts were deserted. The world-loving Lord entered this desolate forest. And in the pavilion of the dilapidated temple of the Yaksha, he stood in Kayotsarga (meditation) with his gaze fixed on the front of his nose. The arrogant Chanda-Koushika serpent, like the night of Kali, came out of his den with his tongue licking. He was roaming in the forest, writing the script of his command with the line of his body as it passed through the sand. As soon as he saw the mighty Lord, he considered it a challenge to his ego and thought, 'Who is this stump-like person who is coming to me without fear?'

"The great compassion of Lord Mahavira, the confluence of the terrible calamities caused by Sangamdeva.

Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verse 3 | 'How dare he stand here, being stubborn, defying me? How did he even dare to enter this forest? Therefore, I will burn him now. I will turn him to ashes.' Thus, burning with anger, the serpent raised its hood. It spat flames of poison from its mouth, and with a terrifying roar that scorched the trees, it fixed its gaze on the Lord. Its blazing eyes, like a meteor falling from the sky onto a mountain, fell upon the Lord's body, but just as the great wind cannot move Mount Meru, so too could it not harm the Lord in any way. 'Why hasn't this wood burned yet?' Thinking this, the serpent, burning with even greater anger, looked repeatedly towards the sun and then released more flames. But those flames too became like streams of water for the Lord. Therefore, the merciless serpent bit the Lord's lotus feet and spat its poison. Thus, it bit repeatedly, and then moved away, thinking, 'Perhaps this one will faint from my poison and fall upon me, crushing me.' Yet, the Lord was not affected by its poison in the slightest. From his thumb, bright, fragrant blood flowed like a stream of milk. After that, the serpent stared at the Lord in astonishment and thought, 'Who is this, upon whom my poison has no effect?' Later, seeing the wondrous form of Jagannath Mahavira, its eyes were dazzled by his radiance and gentleness. Knowing the serpent was calm, the Lord said to it, 'Chandakoushik! Even now, attain enlightenment, understand, awaken, do not be deluded.' Hearing these words of the Lord, the serpent, pondering them in its mind, remembered its past life - it regained its jati-smriti. Now, Chandakoushik was free from passions and calm. He circumambulated the Lord three times and mentally vowed to observe a fast. Seeing the great serpent, free from sinful deeds and immersed in the nectar of peace, accept the fast, the Lord instructed him, 'Vats! Do not go anywhere now, your eyes are filled with poison.' Hearing this, the serpent put its mouth into the bamboo and drank the nectar of equality. Out of compassion, the Lord also stayed there. Truly, the actions of great souls are for the benefit of others.'

Seeing the Lord in this state, the cowherds, their eyes wide with astonishment, rushed there. Hiding behind the trees, they took the stones and pebbles they had brought and mercilessly struck the serpent, who was like a great being. But seeing it unmoved and steady, they were convinced that it was peaceful. Then, they went near it and scratched its body with a piece of wood; yet, it remained still. The cowherds told this to the villagers, and they began to worship the Lord and the great serpent. The milkmaids, who were going to sell ghee on that path, began to smear ghee and butter on the Nagraj's body. The smell attracted sharp-biting ants, which bit and bit, making his body like a sieve. 'This pain is nothing compared to my cruel deeds,' thus reasoning with his soul, the great serpent began to endure that unbearable pain. 'These poor, weak ants might get crushed and die if I move around!' With this thought, the great serpent did not move its limbs even a little. Nourished by the merciful rain of the Lord's grace, and with a steady mind, the serpent died on the fifteenth day and became a god in the Vaimanika Devaloka, called Sahasrar.

Thus, the Lord Mahavira, the supreme Tirthankara, the unique brother of the three worlds, held the same attitude towards both the venomous serpent who inflicted various calamities upon him, and Indra, who worshipped him. ||2||

||3||  **Krtaparadhe'pi jane, kripamantharatarayoh. Ishd-bashpardrayoh bhadram, shrivirajinanetrayoh ||3||**

**Meaning:** May the eyes of Lord Mahavira, filled with compassion and moist with tears of mercy, be auspicious even for those beings who have committed offenses.

**Explanation:** The eyes of Lord Mahavira were filled with boundless compassion even for Sangamdeva and others who had committed offenses. His eyes, overflowing with great compassion within, were always wet with tears. Such were the eyes of Lord Mahavira."

## The Severe Affliction Inflicted Upon Lord Mahavira by Sangamdeva

**May the eyes of Sudhama be blessed.** This means that we offer our salutations to the Lord who is endowed with such powerful yoga. To confirm this statement, we are presenting an account from the life of Lord Mahavira.

**The Great Compassion of Lord Mahavira:**

While traveling from village to village and city to city, Lord Mahavira once arrived at "Dridhbhoomi," a land inhabited by Mlechchha tribes. After performing the austerity of the eighth-fold rejection of attachments (tele), he entered a temple called "Polash" in the forest of "Pedhal" near the village of "Pedhal." He ascended a comfortable stone platform, stood with his hands outstretched to his knees, his body bent, his steady mind focused, his eyes open, and remained in a state of deep meditation for the entire night.

At that time, in the assembly of Saudharma, Indra, the king of the gods, who was seated on his throne, surrounded by eighty-four thousand ordinary gods, thirty-three Trayastrimsa, three Parishadya, four Lokapala, countless scattered gods, and eighty-four thousand guardian gods with armor and weapons all around their bodies, seven commanders, Abhiyogika, Kilvishika, and other gods and goddesses, all adorned with three types of musical instruments, enjoying a joyous time, became aware of the Lord's state through his divine knowledge. He immediately stood up, discarded his sandals, donned his upper garment, placed his right foot on the ground, raised his left foot slightly, bowed his head to the earth, and began to praise the Lord with the Shakrastava (Namutthunan). Indra's entire body was filled with joy. Standing up, he addressed the entire assembly, saying, "O noble gods of the Saudharma heaven! I will tell you about the extraordinary glory of Lord Mahavira, listen. The holder of the five committees, purified by the three secrets, the one who controls anger, pride, delusion, and greed, the one who is without refuge, the one who is indifferent to wealth, territory, time, and emotions, the one who remains steadfast in Kayotsarga (meditation) by focusing his gaze on a tree or a single particle, no one, whether a god, a demon, a Yaksha, a Rakshasa, a Naga, a human, or anyone in the three realms, can distract him from his meditation."

Upon hearing Indra's words, a proud, arrogant, ordinary god named Sangam, with a furrowed brow, fierce eyes, lips chewing in anger, and red eyes, spoke, "O Indra! To praise a human being so highly and elevate him to such a lofty peak is a result of your free-willed authority in the debate of truth and falsehood. It is impossible that even gods cannot distract a person from the mortal realm. Therefore, how can such a boastful statement about the master be held in the heart? Even if it is held, how can it be revealed to everyone? The Meru mountain, which is as tall as the sky and reaches down to the roots of the underworld, which gods can lift like a pebble with two hands, which can submerge the entire earth along with the mountains, which can make the vast ocean like a small river, which can effortlessly lift the massive earth burdened with countless mountains with its club, what is a human being in front of such extraordinary powers, great valor, and the ability to achieve anything simply by wishing? I will go to the person praised by Indra and distract him from his meditation." Saying this, he struck the earth with his hand and stood in the assembly hall. Indra tried to reason with him, explaining that the Arihantdeva performs his unbroken austerities without the help of others, but when he did not understand even a little, Indra ignored the foolish god. The foolish god, being stubborn, left to distract the Lord. Due to his departure, the wind blew fiercely, scattering the clouds. His ferocious form made him appear terrifying. Apsaras (celestial nymphs) moved out of his way in fear. He seemed to have gathered the celestial bodies by colliding with them with his vast chest.

Thus, the wicked god arrived where the Lord was standing in meditation, absorbed in his image. Seeing the peaceful Lord Jagabandhu Shrivira in this way without any reason, he became even more envious. First, the wicked god showered the Jagadguru Mahavira with an immeasurable amount of dust. Just as Rahu covers the moon, and the clouds cover the sun, he covered the entire body of the Lord with a shower of dust. The dust falling from all sides closed the doors of his five senses, and his breathing became obstructed. Still, the Jagadguru did not move even a little. Can elephants ever...

Sangamdeva, driven by intense malice, created a terrible affliction.  Could the three Kula Parvata mountains in the first light of Yoga Shastra be moved? Then, that wicked one, having removed the dust, produced ants with vajramukhi (diamond-like) mouths that tormented the Lord's every limb.  Those ants, with needle-like, sharp mouths, climbed freely from one side of the Lord's body to the other.  Like the desires of the unfortunate, the ants' torment also proved futile.  Then he took the form of a dance.  Truly, "The evil deeds of the wicked never end."  Taking the form of a dance, he bit the Lord's body in many places, causing blood to flow like cow's milk.  The Lord appeared as if a waterfall was flowing from a mountain.  When the Lord was not disturbed by such affliction, the evil-minded Sangamdeva, eager to inflict a fierce bite, took the form of red ants that could not be driven away by pain and deeply embedded their mouths in the Lord's body.  At that time, those ants appeared as if the Lord's body had suddenly become covered in goosebumps.  Even during such affliction, the Lord remained steadfast in his yoga.  But the deva was determined to break his concentration by any means.  Therefore, he created large, poisonous scorpions, as fierce as the sparks of the fire of the apocalypse or like heated arrows, with their twisted tails, they began to cut the Lord's body with their thorns.  When the Nath was not disturbed by that either, the deceitful deva created weasels with sharp teeth, who, with a "khi-khi" sound, tore pieces of flesh from the Lord's body with their teeth and dropped them to the ground.  When his desire was still not fulfilled, in anger, he created serpents with fierce, extremely hot fangs, like the arms of Yama Raja.  Just as a vine wraps around a large tree, they wrapped around the Lord Mahavira's body from head to toe and struck with their fangs in such a way that their fangs began to break.  They bit so fiercely that their teeth broke.  They became venomless and fell like ropes.  After that, the merciless deva immediately created rats with vajra-like hard, sharp claws and teeth.  They began to gnaw and eat the Lord's limbs with their teeth and mouths.  And like sprinkling salt on a wound, they urinated on the wounds they had inflicted.  But even when they were completely unsuccessful in disturbing the Lord, the demon-possessed one took the form of an elephant with a sharp, pestle-like tusk.  The earth trembled when its feet touched the ground, and it raised its trunk so high that it seemed to measure the constellations and the sky, and it crashed down on the Lord.  It grabbed the Lord with its powerful trunk and threw him high into the sky.  With the intention of tearing him to pieces when he fell, the elephant raised its tusk high and caught the falling Lord on the tip of its tusk.  The Lord's vajra-like hard body struck his chest when he landed on the tip of the tusk, causing sparks to fly.  Still, the poor elephant could not even bend a hair on the Lord's head.  Then that deva created a she-elephant like a Vaarini, who, with all her strength in her trunk and tusks, tried to pierce the Lord's body and began to spray poisonous water on him.  But the use of the she-elephant also came to naught.  Then that wicked deva took the form of a terrifying demon, whose fangs were as fierce as a crocodile's.  His mouth was as wide and terrifying as a fire pit filled with many flames, open like a hollow.  His arms were as long as the torana pillars of Yama Raja's palace.  His thighs were as tall and long as a palm tree.  He was wearing leather clothes and carrying a dagger, laughing loudly, roaring, sometimes giggling, trying to frighten the Lord.  He brought many calamities upon the Lord.  But like a lamp that goes out when the oil runs out, that demon was bewildered in front of the Lord, burning with anger.  Then, in anger, that merciless deva immediately took the form of a lion and roared, flicked his tail, as if tearing the earth apart, echoing through the sky and the earth with his cruel roar, he crashed down on the Lord.  He began to attack the Lord continuously with his vajra-like fangs and nail-like thorns.  When he was unsuccessful in this, like a tree burned by a wildfire, the wicked deva took the form of King Siddhartha and Trisala Devi and said to the Lord, "Son! Why are you doing such an extremely difficult penance? Give up this initiation, do not reject our request.  Nandivardhana has abandoned us in our old age, and we are helpless.  Protect us."  Saying this, they both began to lament in a mournful voice.  Even their lamentations did not move the Lord's heart.

The Final Assault by Sangamdeva

Yoga Shastra, First Light, 3: He was not disturbed by attachment. Therefore, the wicked god set up his army camp near the Lord, where he was meditating. When the cooks could not find stones to build a hearth, they used the Lord's two feet as a hearth and placed a pot on it. They lit a fire below. It seemed as if a wildfire had erupted at the foot of a mountain. Even though the intense flames burned fiercely, the Lord's body did not lose its radiance, but instead, it grew brighter, like glowing gold. Then, the wicked god created a settlement of wild Bhils, where the Bhils shouted loudly. The Bhils hung cages of small birds around the Lord's neck, ears, arms, and thighs. The birds pecked and clawed at the Lord's body, making it full of holes. It looked like a cage with many holes. This experiment also proved futile for the god, like a dry leaf. Then, he unleashed a great storm called Samvartak, which made huge trees appear to fly in the sky like straws and then fall down. Pebbles and stones flew like dust in every direction. He blew air like a bellows, tossing the Lord up and down in the sky and throwing him down on the earth. But even this great wind did not fulfill the god's desire. Then, the disgrace of the gods unleashed a whirlwind called Vayu-vartul. This whirlwind, which could shake large mountains, spun the Lord like a lump of clay on a potter's wheel. But even when this whirlwind, like water in the ocean, spun the Lord, he did not budge from his meditation. Then, the god thought, "Oh! This man with a mind of iron has not been disturbed at all by the many kinds of tortures I have inflicted on him. So, how can I go to the assembly of gods without fulfilling my vow and disturbing his meditation? Therefore, it would be best to find a way to end his life. Only then will his meditation be broken, otherwise not." Thinking this, the wicked god created a solid, vajra-like Kalchakra (wheel of time) weighing a thousand palas of iron. He lifted it up like Ravana had lifted Mount Kailash. It was as if he had prepared another garment to wrap around the earth. He lifted this Kalchakra up and threw it at the Lord. It fell on the Lord like a wildfire in the ocean, making all directions terrifying with its flames. The Lord sank into the ground up to his knees under the impact of this wheel, which could pulverize large mountains. Even in this situation, the Lord thought, "Even though I am eager to save all the creatures of the world, I have become the cause of this poor fellow's wandering in the world." Sangamdeva thought, "Oh! I have tried the final measure of using the Kalchakra, but he is still alive. Therefore, I should try something else besides weapons. Perhaps he will be disturbed by this assault in some way." With this intention, he came before the Lord, sitting in his chariot, and said, "O great sage! I am satisfied with you because of your virtue and the effect of the penance you have begun by risking your life. Therefore, give up this penance that torments your body. What is the benefit of such penance? Ask for whatever you want. Tell me, what can I give you? Do not doubt this in the least; your desire will be fulfilled. Shall I give you heaven through this body? Or shall I free you from the karmas of countless births and give you liberation, which is the state of eternal bliss? Or shall I give you an inexhaustible kingdom where all kings will obey your commands?" When the Lord's mind did not waver even at these tempting words of the god and he did not receive any reply from the Lord, the sinful god thought again, "He has made all my experiments and powers unsuccessful. Now, only one infallible measure remains, and that is the science of love. I will try that too. Because, like the weapon of love, the sight of beautiful women breaks even the masculinity of great yogis." With this determination in his mind, he created celestial nymphs and the six seasons that help in their enjoyment. Along with this, Vasant-Lakshmi, like the main dancer in the play of Kamadeva, adorned the place with the sweet sounds of the mad cuckoo. The summer season, like a maid who has learned art from her companions, shone brightly, spreading the fragrance of her face with the pollen of blooming Kadamba flowers. The season of spring, excited by the fragrant Kevada flowers, which were like auspicious tilak marks at the coronation of Kamadeva, was adorned with...

## Decision to Compose the Yoga Shastra

The first volume of Yoga Shastra was published in the fourth month of the rainy season. The autumn season, adorned with newly bloomed lotuses, also shone brightly, displaying its magnificent wealth with thousands of eyes. As if writing a proclamation of victory for Kamadeva with fresh jasmine buds like white letters, the Hemant season also arrived. The Hemant season, adorned like a courtesan with jasmine and Sindhuvar flowers, was followed by the Shishir season, which also enhanced its beauty. In this way, all four seasons appeared. Then, like the flag of Kamadeva, the celestial maidens appeared. They played musical tunes like mantras to conquer Kamadeva, revealing their limbs to the Lord. Many celestial maidens played the Veena with the Gandhar raga, singing songs in rhythmic order. Others played the Veena sweetly, expressing the rhythm in reverse and forward order, using their full artistry. Many celestial maidens played three types of Mridanga, with deep voices like clouds, using different types of beats and rhythms. Some celestial maidens danced, creating wonder in the sky and on earth, with new and captivating gestures and glances. Many maidens twisted their limbs and swayed, showing their armpits, pretending to tie their broken garments and loose hair. Many, under the pretense of acting with their long legs, repeatedly showed their thighs and lower body, adorned with beautiful Gorocan paste and fair complexion. Many goddesses pretended to tie the loose knot of their Ghaghra, revealing their navel. Many, under the pretense of acting with their ivory-like hands, gestured to embrace their limbs. Some maidens, under the pretense of tightly tying the string of their inner garment below the waist, removed their upper saree, revealing their buttocks. Many beautiful goddesses, under the pretense of twisting their limbs, showed their firm and prominent breasts for a long time, and said, "If you are free from attachment, then why do you create attachment in us? If you are detached from the body, then why don't you offer us your chest? And if you are merciful, then why don't you protect us from Kamadeva, who suddenly draws his bow-shaped weapon? It is fine to scorn our love with curiosity for a while, but it is not appropriate to hold onto this stubbornness until death." And many other goddesses said, "Lord! Abandon your harshness and make your mind gentle. Fulfill our desire. Do not ignore our prayers." In this way, the Lord was not moved even a little by the songs, dances, musical performances, gestures, and sweet words of love of the celestial maidens. In this way, the entire night passed, enduring many favorable and unfavorable obstacles. After this, Sangamdeva, the demon, obstructed the Lord's pure food for six months and continued to create various disturbances. But in the end, defeated and exhausted, he said to the Lord, "Bhattarak! Stay happily and travel as you wish; now I am leaving." Thus, he left after six months, burdened with heavy sins. The Lord's compassionate heart was moved, thinking, "Where will this poor creature go with such sins? What will happen to him? Even I, the savior, could not save him!" Thinking in this way, his eyes became moist with tears of compassion.

In this way, after saluting the Ishtadev, he now presents the Yoga Shastra, with the desire to speak about Yoga, the cause of the path to liberation.

**4. श्रुताम्भोधेरधिगम्य, सम्प्रदायाच्च सद्गुरोः । स्वसंवेदनतश्चापि, योगशास्त्रं विरच्यते ॥४॥**

**Meaning:** Knowing from the ocean of scriptures, from the tradition of the true Guru, and from my own experience, I compose the Yoga Shastra.

**Decision to Compose the Yoga Shastra:**

This verse states that it is appropriate to compose a Shastra after deciding on the meaning of the word "Yoga" (knowledge). Therefore, to decide on the meaning of Yoga, one must know three things: 1. From the scriptures, 2. From the Guru tradition, and 3. From one's own experience. This 'Yoga Shastra' is being composed after deciding on the meaning of the word "Yoga" through these three methods. This is the same thing...

## The Greatness of Yoga: Pride and Detachment in the Form of Sanatkumara Chakravarti

The Yoga Shastra, in the first light, verses 5 and 6, states that this Yoga Shastra is being composed based on the ocean of Agamas, the words of our Gurus, and our own experience. This will be stated again at the end of this text. What I have learned from the Shastra, the Guru's words, and my own experience, is the Upanishad of Yoga, which will amaze the minds of the wise. Therefore, at the earnest request of King Kumarapala of the Chalukya dynasty, Acharya Bhagwan Shri Hemchandrasuri Shwarji has composed this Yoga Shastra through his words. ||4|| Now, we will explain the greatness of Yoga. ||5||

Yoga is a sharp axe that cuts through the thicket of all kinds of calamities, and it is a charm that subdues the Lakshmi of liberation, free from herbs, mantras, and tantras. ||5||

**Meaning:** Yoga is like a sharp axe that cuts through the thicket of all kinds of calamities, both spiritual, material, and divine. It destroys the fruits of evil deeds. The second half of the verse explains that Yoga leads to the attainment of the ultimate goal of liberation, the Lakshmi of liberation. In the world, to perform charms, one has to use herbs, mantras, and tantras, but Yoga is an infallible means of subduing the Lakshmi of liberation without herbs, mantras, and tantras. ||5||

**Implication:** How can the work of calamities be destroyed without removing the cause? Therefore, we speak of Yoga, which destroys the sins that are the root cause. ||5||

**Verse 6:** Even great sins are destroyed by Yoga, like dense clouds are scattered by a fierce wind. ||6||

**Meaning:** Just as a fierce wind scatters a series of dense clouds, so too, many sins are destroyed by the influence of Yoga. ||6||

**Question:** It is possible that sins acquired in one birth may be destroyed by the influence of Yoga, but how can the destruction of many sins acquired over countless births be possible through Yoga? We answer this in the next verse. ||6||

**Verse 7:** Yoga destroys even sins acquired over a long time, just as a fierce fire burns up accumulated firewood in an instant. ||7||

**Meaning:** Just as a fierce fire burns up firewood accumulated over a long time in an instant, so too, Yoga destroys sins accumulated over countless births in an instant. ||7||

We also explain another fruit of Yoga. ||8||

**Verse 8:** The yogi obtains all medicinal wealth (powerful) like phlegm, mucus, excrement, touch, etc., and the ability to perceive the objects of all senses through any one sense, this is the wonder of the practice of Yoga. ||8||

**Explanation:** For the yogi, phlegm, mucus, excrement, earwax, tooth decay, eye and tongue dirt, touch of hands, etc., excrement, urine, hair, nails, etc., all these things, whether spoken or unspoken, become medicinal in nature due to the influence of Yoga. They act as medicine. What medicines do, these things can do. Not only that, but Yoga also grants the abilities (powers) of anima, etc., and the ability to perceive all senses through one sense. It was the influence of Yoga that enabled yogis like Sanatkumara to obtain the power to cure all diseases through phlegm points due to the influence of their Yoga. ||8||

Below, we present the example of Sanatkumara Chakravarti.

## The Benefits of Yoga

**Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verse 8, The Story of Sanatkumar Chakravarti:**

In the city of Hastinapur, the fourth Chakravarti named Sanatkumar ruled over six regions. Once, in the assembly of the gods, Indra Maharaj, filled with wonder, praised his unparalleled beauty and wealth, saying, "The appearance of Sanatkumar Chakravarti, the crown jewel of the Kuru dynasty, is unmatched in the heavens or on earth."

Not believing this praise, two gods named Vijay and Vaijayant came to the mortal realm to test Sanatkumar. They assumed the form of Brahmins and approached the gatekeeper of Sanatkumar's palace to see his form. At that time, Sanatkumar was preparing for his bath, having removed all his clothes and wearing only a loincloth, while receiving an oil massage. The gatekeeper informed Sanatkumar Chakravarti about the arrival of the two Brahmins at the gate. The just Chakravarti immediately granted them entry.

Seeing Sanatkumar, the two gods, their eyes wide with wonder, shook their heads and pondered, "Oh! His forehead is like the moon on the eighth night, his eyes reach his ears, his body radiates a brilliance that surpasses the blue lotus. His lips are like ripe bimba fruit, his ears like conch shells, his neck surpasses even the Panchajanya conch, his arms rival the trunk of an elephant, his chest steals the glory of Mount Meru, his waist is like the belly of a lion cub. What more can we say, the beauty of his entire body is beyond description. Oh! We cannot comprehend the loveliness of his radiance, like the moonlight, bathing his body in the flow of the river. His form is even more magnificent than Indra Maharaj described."

The great ones never speak falsehood. At that moment, the Chakravarti spoke, "O learned Brahmins, what is the purpose of your visit?" They replied, "O Narasimha! Your form is extraordinary and wondrous in this world of moving and unmoving beings. Hearing descriptions of your form from far and wide, a desire to see it arose in our hearts, and that is why we have come here. Until today, we had only heard descriptions of your wondrous form, but never seen it with our own eyes. Now, seeing your form, our eyes are satisfied."

Smiling, Sanatkumar said, "O learned Brahmins! The radiance of an oiled body is nothing. Stay a while, sit down, and wait until I have finished my bath. See, when I am adorned with various wondrous garments and precious ornaments, then behold my form, like golden studded with jewels."

Saying this, Sanatkumar bathed, donned his garments and ornaments, and sat on his throne in the royal court, shining like the moon in the sky. The king immediately summoned the two Brahmins. Standing before the king, they gazed at his form and thought, "Where is that form and radiance, and where is this faded form and loveliness now? Truly, all things in the world are transient."

The king asked, "O learned Brahmins! You were delighted to see me earlier, why is your face now so gloomy?" Then, with words like nectar, they said, "O great one! We are both gods, residents of the Saudharma heaven. Indra Maharaj praised your form in the assembly of the gods. We did not believe his words. Therefore, we assumed the form of humans and came here to see your form. We saw your form, as described by Indra Maharaj, in its true form earlier. But now, that form is no longer the same. Just as a mirror becomes tarnished by breath, so too has the radiance of your body become tarnished. Your form has become distorted, your loveliness faded. Your body is now surrounded by many diseases."

Having spoken the truth, the two gods disappeared.

The king looked at his lifeless body, like a scorched tree. He thought, "This body, always like a house of disease, is to be condemned! Foolish fools, with dull minds, are attached to it in vain. Just as a large log is eaten by terrible worms, so too are various kinds of terrible diseases, born in the body, eating away at it. No matter how good this body may appear from the outside, it is full of worms inside, like a ripe fruit. Just as the beauty of a magnificent lake is destroyed when algae covers its water, so too is the beauty of this body destroyed when disease covers it."

The various benefits obtained from the influence of yoga
The first light verse 8 of Yoga Shastra destroys it. The body becomes loose, but hope does not become loose; the form goes away, but the sinful mind does not go away; old age increases, but knowledge does not increase. Damn, such a form of worldly beings! Like a drop of dew on the tip of a blade of grass, all things in this world, such as form, beauty, radiance, body, wealth, etc., are fickle. The nature of the body was today, it will not remain tomorrow. Therefore, it is the cause of attaining great fruits to perform penance with this body and to make the karma of desires dry (diminish). Thus, immersed in the feeling of detachment, the Chakravarti awakened the desire to take Muni initiation. He immediately crowned his son and handed over the kingdom, and himself went to the garden with humility and took Muni initiation from Shri Vinayadhar Suriji and adopted the restraint of the form of all virtues.
Wearing the great vows and the subsequent virtues, the Rajarshi wandered from village to village with equanimity and single-minded devotion. Just as his community follows behind the leader of the herd of elephants, so did the people follow behind the Rajarshi with deep affection. The people of that kshayarahit, indifferent, selfless, and non-possessive Rajarshi served for six months. Still, their mind did not want to return in any way. (Then the family went away) They used to take alms as per the rules. Due to not getting food on time and eating unwholesome food, many diseases took up residence in their body. Itching, swelling, fever, breathing, loss of appetite, stomach ache and eye pain, the Rajarshi endured the pain of these seven types of diseases with equanimity for seven hundred years. By enduring all the unbearable hardships and not taking any measures to prevent them, he obtained many benefits. At that time, out of wonder in his heart, Indra Maharaj praised that Muni in front of the gods - 'Leaving the glory of being a Chakravarti like a burning blade of grass, this Sanatkumar Muni is doing difficult penance, due to the influence of penance, he has obtained all the benefits. Still, he is indifferent to his body. Even they do not treat their diseases.' On Indra's words, the gods named Vijay and Vaijayant did not believe, so they came to Sanatkumar Muni in the form of a physician and said - 'Fortunate Muni! Why are you suffering from illness? We both are physicians. We treat patients all over the world, and you are sick | So give us permission! We will cure your disease in one day.' Hearing this, Sanatkumar Muni replied - 'Doctors! This creature has two types of diseases - one is physical disease and the other is emotional disease. Anger, pride, illusion and greed etc. are emotional diseases, which are suffered by the soul who has a body and follow the creature for thousands of births and give immense suffering. If you can cure those diseases, then treat them. But if you only cure the physical diseases of the body | | Then I also have the power to cure such diseases.' Saying this, he applied his phlegm on his rotten finger filled with pus. Just as copper starts to shine when applying Siddha Rasa, so that finger started to shine like gold when applying phlegm. Seeing the finger like a golden needle, those gods fell at his feet and said - 'Muni! We are the same gods who came to see your form before. Indra Maharaj had said that 'even after obtaining benefits, Sanatkumar Rajarshi is doing wonderful penance by voluntarily enduring the pain of disease.' That is why we came here. We have come here and tested you directly. You passed in it.' Saying this, both the gods saluted him and became invisible. We have given one example of the benefit of the phlegm they obtained. They had many other benefits | obtained, but we do not describe them here for fear of the book becoming too long. Other benefits obtained from the influence of yoga:. Due to the influence of yoga, the yogi's excreta is also capable of destroying diseases and it also has the fragrance of a lotus | also comes. The excreta of all body-bearers is considered to be of two types. One is the one that comes out of the ears, eyes etc. and the other is the excreta, urine, sweat etc. that comes out of the body. The yogis have such a powerful effect of yoga that their aforementioned two types of excreta remove the diseases of all patients. Both the aforementioned types of excreta have the fragrance of musk.

## The Benefits Gained Through Yoga

Yoga Shastra, the first light, verse 8 states: Just as the sprinkling of nectar destroys all diseases, so too, the touch of a yogi's body instantly destroys all diseases. The nails, hair, teeth, and other parts of a yogi's body become medicinal. Therefore, they are called "Sarvaushadhilabdhiman" (possessors of all medicines). For this reason, the bones and other parts of the Tirthankara's body are enshrined and worshipped in the Devaloka. 

In addition, many other benefits manifest in the body of a yogi. The mere touch of a yogi's body makes rainwater, river water, lake water, or water from any reservoir capable of curing all diseases. Their touch detoxifies poisonous air and revives unconscious beings. Poisonous food, upon entering a yogi's mouth, becomes non-poisonous. Even those suffering from severe poison or a deadly disease become free from poison and disease simply by hearing their words or seeing them. This is the secret of "Sarvaushadhi" (all medicines). 

In essence, the yogi's "Kaf" (phlegm) and other great powers are similar to, or different aspects of, "Riddhis" (supernatural powers). "Vaikriya Labdhi" (power of transformation) also has many forms. These include: "Anutva" (becoming as small as an atom), "Mahattva" (becoming as large as Mount Meru), "Laghutva" (becoming lighter than air), "Gurutva" (becoming heavier than a thunderbolt), "Praapti" (being able to touch the tip of Mount Meru and the sun with the tip of one's finger while standing on earth), "Praakamy" (being able to walk on water like walking on land, and float or sink on land like swimming in water), "Ishitva" (having dominion over the three realms, attaining the power of a Tirthankara or Indra), and "Kamaroopitva" (being able to assume multiple forms simultaneously). All these "Vaikriya Labdhis" are also included within the great "Riddhis". 

Beyond these, there are many other benefits related to knowledge and intellect that are gained through yoga practice. For example, due to the intense destruction and cessation of "Shrutagyanavaraneya" and "Veeryantaraya" karmas, the practitioner attains the extraordinary "Mahaprajna Riddhi" (great wisdom). This power enables them to expound the knowledge of the twelve angas and fourteen purvas even without formally studying them. The intellect of such a "Mahaprajnavan" (possessor of great wisdom) can clearly explain the most profound and complex meanings. 

Some "Vidyadhari" (knowledge-possessing) monks attain "Vidyalabdhi" (knowledge power) and study up to ten purvas. Some become knowledgeable in "Mahavidyas" (great knowledge) like "Rohini" and "Prajni", and in "Alpavidyas" (minor knowledge) like "Angushthaprashna". They are then not under the control of any "Riddhiman" (possessor of supernatural powers). Many practitioners become skilled in presenting and analyzing topics beyond their studied subjects. Among these "Vidyadharashraman" (knowledge-possessing monks), some attain "Beejabuddhi" (seed intellect), "Kosthabuddhi" (storehouse intellect), and "Padanusaribuddhi" (sequential intellect). 

Those who possess "Beejabuddhi" are able to grasp many meanings from a single seed-like word due to the intense destruction and cessation of "Gyanavaraneya" and other karmas. Just as a farmer, by sowing a single seed in well-tilled land, obtains many seeds through the combined effect of rain or irrigation, sunlight, and wind, so too, these individuals, upon hearing a single word, acquire many meanings. 

Those with "Kosthabuddhi" are like skilled farmers who store a large amount of grain in granaries, ensuring that different grains do not mix or spoil. Similarly, they remember the various meanings of each "Shruta" (scripture) they hear, without needing to repeat them, and retain them securely in their "Kostha" (storehouse) of the mind. 

There are three types of "Padanusaribuddhi": "Anusrot", "Pratirot", and "Ubhayapad". 1. Those with "Anusrotpadanusaribuddhi" have an extremely sharp intellect that, upon hearing the meaning of the first word of a text, can recall the entire text up to the last word. 2. Those with "Pratirotpadanusaribuddhi" have an intellect that, upon hearing the meaning of the last word or the entire text, can recall the meaning or text from the beginning. 3. Those with "Ubhayapadpadanusaribuddhi" have an exceptionally sharp intellect that, upon hearing the meaning of a word in the middle of a text, can recall the entire group of words from beginning to end, along with their corresponding meanings, and traverse the entire ocean of knowledge. 

The difference between "Beejabuddhi" and "Padanusaribuddhi" is that "Beejabuddhi" is skilled in explaining many meanings from a single word, while "Padanusaribuddhi" is capable of knowing all other words by knowing one word.

## Charan Labdhi and its Various Types

**Yoga Shastra Pratham Prakash Shloka 9:** In the same way, Mano-bali, Vachan-bali, and Kaya-bali are also types of Labdhi-dharis. The one whose pure mind, due to the special characteristic of the extreme destruction of Manojnaanaavaran and Veeryantaraay karmas, is able to extract the essential element in an instant and dive into the entire ocean of Shrutis, is called a Mano-bali Labdhiman. The one whose power of speech is able to speak the entire Shruti-vastu in an instant is called a Vag-bali Labdhiman; or, the one whose speech flows uninterruptedly and without any hindrance in the throat while uttering words, sentences, and figures of speech, is also called a Vag-bali. The one in whom extraordinary Kaya-bali Yoga manifests due to the destruction of Veetaraay karmas, so that even after standing for a long time in Kayotsarga, there is no fatigue or restlessness, is called a Kaya-bali Labdhiman. For example, Bahubali Muni, who stood for a year in Kayotsarga-pratima, was a Kaya-bali.

Similarly, there are Yogas like Ksheera Labdhi, Madhu Labdhi, and Amrita Labdhi. The one whose vessel, even if it contains spoiled food, transforms into the taste of milk, honey, ghee, and nectar, becoming a strength-enhancing substance, or the one who, like Kheer, brings joy to souls who have experienced verbal, physical, and mental suffering, are called Ksheerasrav, Madhvasrav, Sarpirasrav, and Amritasrav Labdhi holders respectively. They are of two types: one is Aksheen-Mahanas Labdhiman and the other is Aksheen-Mahalay Labdhi Dhar. The one whose vessel, due to the destruction of extraordinary Antaraay karmas, even if given a small amount of food, does not get exhausted even after giving it to many, like Gautam Swami, is called Aksheen-Mahanas Labdhiman. In a limited area of land where countless gods, Tithanchas, and humans with their families are packed together, with no space to sit, the presence of an Aksheen-Mahalay Labdhi Dhar creates enough space for everyone to sit comfortably, like the Samavasaran of a Tirthankara.

Similarly, it is said that Mahaprajna and other Labdhis are also attained by Prajna Shramanas and other Sadhakas; due to their influence, they can know the objects of all senses through a single sense; such Maha-ridhi is called Sambhinna-Srot Labdhi.

**8.**

**9.** Charanasheevishavadhi-Manah-Paryaya Sampadah. Yogakalp-druma-syaitah, Vikasiku-sumashriyah.

**9.** **Meaning:** The wealth of Charan Vidya, Asheevisha Labdhi, Avadhi Jnana, and Manah-Paryaya Jnana; all these are the developed flower-glory of the Kalpa-vriksha, which is Yoga.

**Explanation:** The extraordinary power that allows one to move freely in water, land, or sky is called Charan Labdhi. The Labdhi that enables a Sadhaka to harm (curse) or benefit (bless) others is called Asheevisha Labdhi. The Labdhi that allows one to directly perceive the unknowable, indirect substance through the senses, without the help of the senses, is called Avadhi Jnana Labdhi. The power to directly see the permutations of another's mind-substance, which is achieved through the influence of Labdhi, is called Manah-Paryaya Jnana Labdhi. All these Labdhis are like flowers of the Kalpa-vriksha, which is Yoga. The fruit obtained from them is Keval Jnana or Moksha, which we will explain further with the examples of Bharat Chakravarti and Marudevi.

Charan Labdhi is of two types: Jangha Charan Labdhi and Vidya Charan Labdhi. Both these Labdhis are attained only by Munis. The Jangha Charan Labdhi Dhar Muni can easily fly and reach the Ruchak Dweep in one step; while returning, they can also fly from Ruchak Dweep to Nandishwar Dweep in one step and return to their original place in another step. They can also fly upwards and reach the peak of Mount Meru in one step, then stay there and reach Panduvan; while returning, they can also fly back to Nandishwar Dweep in one step and return to their original place in another step. The Vidya Charan Labdhi Dhar Muni can fly to the Manushottar Parvat in one step and to Nandishwar Dweep in another step; from there, they can fly back to their original place in one step. Many Charan Labdhi Dhar Munis can also move upwards and downwards in the same way in the Tiryanch-gati.

## Charan Labdhi and its Various Types

**Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verses 9-10**

There are many types of Charanmunis. Some can travel through the sky by sitting cross-legged, or with their legs in Kayotsarga, without moving their feet up and down. Some are skilled in moving by taking support from water, thighs, fruits, flowers, leaves, flames, smoke, snow, rain, spider webs, rays of light, and wind. 

Among them, some Charan Labdhi-possessing Munis are skilled in walking on water like land, without harming aquatic creatures in wells, rivers, and oceans; they are called Jalcharan Labdhiman Munis. Those who are skilled in walking in the lower sky, four anguli-praman (finger-widths) above the ground, and moving their feet up and down, are called Janghcharan Labdhiman Munis. 

Some are skilled in walking on the surface of fruits, without harming the creatures living on them, by taking support from different types of fruits; they are called Falcharan Labdhi-possessing Munis. Similarly, some can move by taking support from the petals of flowers, without harming the subtle creatures living on them, by holding onto various types of trees, vines, plants, or flowers; they are called Pushpcharan Labdhi-possessing Munis. 

Those who are skilled in walking by taking support from various types of plants, vines, sprouts, new shoots, leaves, etc., without harming the subtle creatures living on them, and moving their feet up and down, are called Patracharan Labdhi-possessing Munis. 

Those who are skilled in climbing up and down the peak of a Nishdha or Neel mountain, which is four hundred yojanas high, by taking support from its peak, are called Shrenicharan Labdhiman Munis. 

Those who have the power to travel by taking hold of the flame of fire, without harming the creatures living in the fire and without burning themselves, are called Agnishikhacharan Labdhi-possessing Munis. 

Those who can travel smoothly by taking support from the high or slanted series of smoke, are called Dhumcharan Labdhi-possessing Munis. 

Those who can travel smoothly by taking support from ice, without harming the creatures living in it, are called Niharcharan Labdhi-possessing Munis. 

Those who have the ability to travel by taking support from fog, without harming the creatures living in it, are called Avshaycharan Labdhiman Munis. 

Those who have the power to travel in the vast expanse of clouds in the sky, without harming the creatures living there, are called Meghacharan Labdhi-possessing Munis. 

Those who have the power to travel by taking support from the flow of water, such as rain, during the rainy season, without harming the creatures living there, are called Varidharacharan Labdhi-possessing Munis. 

Those who are skilled in walking by taking support from the threads of spider webs built in the hollows of ancient trees, without breaking the threads and lifting their feet, are called Markatkatantucharan Labdhi-possessing Munis. 

Those who have the power to walk on the sky like land, by taking support from the rays of any light, such as the moon, sun, planets, and stars, are called Jyotirrashmicharan Labdhi-possessing Munis. 

Those who are skilled in walking smoothly by taking support from the wind, in any direction, whether it is unfavorable or favorable, and no matter how strong it is, are called Vayucharan Labdhi-possessing Munis. 

**Beyond Tapas and Charitra**

Even without the influence of Tapas and Charitra, other qualities can lead to Labdhis and Riddhis. 

**Aashivish Labdhi**

Those who possess Aashivish Labdhi are capable of both harming and benefiting others. 

**Avadhigyan Labdhi**

The ability to directly perceive all types of objects that are beyond the reach of the senses, within a certain limit, is called Avadhigyan Labdhi. 

**Manahparyaygyan Labdhi**

The ability to illuminate the mental states or mental objects of beings living in the two and a half islands surrounding the human realm is called Manahparyaygyan Labdhi. It has two types: Rijumati and Vipulmati. 

Vipulmati Manahparyaygyan, once attained, is never lost and becomes purer. Rijumati is less pure and can be lost. 

**The Greatness of Yoga**

Now, we will discuss the greatness of Yoga and the fruit of Kevalgyan, which is attained as a result of it. 

**Verse 10**

**Aho Yogasya Mahatmyam, Prajya Samrajyam Udvahan | Avaap Kevalgyanam, Bharato Bharataadhip ||10||**

**Meaning:** Oh, how great is Yoga! Even the ruler of the Bharat Kshetra, who bears the responsibility of a vast empire, Shri Bharat Chakravarti, attained Kevalgyan.

## The Birth, Body, and Marriage of Rishabhdev

**Chapter 1 of Yoga Shastra, Verse 10 Commentary:** The story of Bharat Chakravarti is as follows:

**The Birth and Coronation of Rishabhdev:** After the passing of the first era, called Sushma-Sushma, which spanned four Koti-Koti Sagaropama (billions of billions of oceans) years, and the second era, called Sushma, which spanned three Koti-Koti Sagaropama years, and after the passing of eight parts of a Palyopama (a unit of time) less than two Koti-Koti Sagaropama years of the third era, called Sushma-Dushma, seven Kulkaras (patriarchs) were born in the southern part of Bharat: 1. Vimlavahan, 2. Chakshusman, 3. Yashasvi, 4. Abhichandra, 5. Prasenajit, 6. Marudeva, and 7. Nabhi, in that order. The wife of Nabhi Kulkar was Marudevi, who purified the three worlds with her supreme virtue. Eighty-four lakh (840,000) years before the end of the third era, when three years and eight and a half months remained, the first Jineshwara (Jain Tirthankara) was born in the womb of Marudevi, descending from the Sarvarth Siddha Vimana (a celestial vehicle) and heralding his arrival with fourteen great dreams. At that time, Nabhi Raja and Marudevi could not understand the meaning of these fourteen dreams. Therefore, Indra (the king of the gods) came and explained their meaning with joy. Then, on the auspicious day of the fourth day of the waning moon in the month of Ashadha, Rishabhdev was born. Fifty-six Dikkumari (celestial maidens) came and performed the delivery rituals. Indra took the Lord to Mount Meru, placed him on his lap, and performed the Lord's abhisheka (coronation) with holy water and his own tears of joy. Later, Indra took the Lord and handed him over to his mother. The Lord's entire dhaatri karma (childcare rituals) was performed by the goddesses. Seeing the mark of a bull on the Lord's right thigh, his parents happily named him Rishabh. The Lord, like the rays of the moon, brought immense joy and grew up nourished by divine food.

**Naming the Lord's Lineage:** Once, Indra came to serve the Lord. He began to think about what name to give to the lineage of the first Tirthankara, Rishabhdev. The Lord, knowing Indra's thoughts through his Avadhigyan (clairvoyance), extended his hand like an elephant's trunk to take the Ikshudanda (cane) from Indra's hand. Indra offered the cane to the Lord, bowed down, and at that moment, the Lord's lineage was named Ikshvaku.

**A Poetic Description of the Lord's Body:** After spending his childhood, the Lord, like the midday sun, entered his youth. In his youth, the soles of the Lord's feet were flat, red, and soft like lotus petals. They were warm, free from tremors, and did not sweat. On the Lord's feet were the marks of a wheel, Lakshmi Devi (goddess of wealth) performing abhisheka, an elephant, flowers, garlands, a goad, and a flag. These marks seemed to be there to erase the sorrows of those who bowed down to his feet. In the Lord's feet, which were like the playhouse of Lakshmi Devi, were the auspicious marks of a conch, a pot, a fish, and a swastika. The Lord's thumbs were full, strong, round, and high, resembling a serpent's hood and adorned with the Srivatsa mark like a calf. The Lord's toes were straight, without holes, free from tremors due to the absence of air, shining like a lamp flame, and resembling lotus petals. Underneath the Lord's toes were Nandyaavarta (swirling patterns) that shone so brightly that their reflection on the ground seemed to be the cause of Dharma (righteousness). The joints of the toes were beautiful like wells. They seemed to be the seeds sown for the Lord's marriage to the world's Lakshmi. The Lord's heels were round like tubers and long and wide in proportion. His nails seemed like the head ornaments of the elephants that were his thumbs and toes. The Lord's ankles were adorned like the half-opened petals of a golden lotus. The Lord's legs, from top to bottom, were gradually elevated like a tortoise's. His veins were not visible. His hair shone with its own radiance. The Lord's thighs were round, fair, and strong, like a deer's thighs, with flesh so firm that the bones inside were not visible. His soft, shining, strong thighs were beautiful like a banana tree trunk. His round, fleshy knees seemed like a mirror set in a pillow filled with cotton. The Lord's two testicles were hidden like an elephant's. His male organ, like that of a noble horse, was extremely hidden, with no visible veins. It was neither low, high, nor loose, but straight, soft, hairless, round, fragrant, cool, resembling a clockwise conch, with a single edge, free from any ugliness.

Description of the Body and Marriage

Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verse 10 | The cycle was recurring. The linga was like the covering of a cell. Their waist was long, thick, fleshy (full), large and hard. The middle part of the waist was thin, making it look like the middle part of Indra's thunderbolt. Their navel was adorned like the whirlpool of a deep river. Their abdomen was smooth, fleshy, soft, simple and even. Their chest, as vast and elevated as a golden rock, seemed like the pedestal of the Srivatsa gem or the platform for Lakshmi Devi to play on. Their shoulders were elevated, strong and robust like those of a bull, and under both shoulders their armpits were free of odor, sweat and dirt, with sparse hair. Two arms, strong like a serpent's hood and long to the knees, seemed like a serpent's noose to subdue the fickle Lakshmi. The Lord's palm was red like the new leaves of a mango tree, hard without labor, free of sweat, poreless and warm. In the middle of it were the marks and signs of the bow, fish, Srivatsa, thunderbolt, goad, flag, pot, fly whisk, umbrella, conch, lotus, ocean, Mount Meru, crocodile, bull, lion, horse, chariot, swastika, elephant, palace, torana, etc. Their thumbs and fingers, with red, simple and blood-red nails, seemed like the buds of ruby-like flowers on the top of a wish-fulfilling tree. On the Lord's thumb, full barley grains were prominently displayed, as if they were specially nourishing his fame-like excellent horse. In the upper part of the Lord's finger were clockwise conch-like lines that bestowed all wealth. On the wrist at the base of the hand, three lines were inscribed, indicating the removal of suffering from the three worlds. Their neck was round, long, sanctified by three lines, sweet and deep-voiced, and resembled a conch. The Lord's pure, round and radiant face seemed like a second moon without blemish. The Lord's two cheeks, fleshy, soft and bright, seemed like two golden mirrors that resided with Saraswati and Lakshmi. The Lord's two ears, hanging down to the shoulders due to their inner whorl, were shining like two conch shells of the Lord's face-like radiance, lying on the seashore. The Lord's two lips were like bimba fruits. Their thirty-two bright teeth were adorned like jasmine flowers. Their nose, gradually high and wide, resembled bamboo. The Lord's chin was neither too long nor too short, but even, full of flesh, round and soft. And their beard and mustache were full, shiny, black and soft, filled with thick black hair. The Lord's tongue was red and soft like the newly born leaves of a wish-fulfilling tree. It was neither very long nor thick. It was a tongue that spoke the meaning of the twelve limbs. The Lord's eyes, black and bright in the middle and red at both ends, and long to the end of the ear, seemed as if they were made of blue crystal and ruby. Their black and curved eyebrows, like those of collyrium, seemed like bees sitting on blooming lotuses. The Lord's black and curved eyebrows were giving the beauty of a creeper born on the bank of a vision-like stream. The Lord's forehead was vast, soft, round, pleasant and hard, like the eighth-day moon. The Lord's head, elevated and round like an umbrella, indicated the lordship of the three worlds. The turban placed on the Lord's head, supporting the middle part of the head, was enhancing the beauty of the pot placed on the head. The hair on the Lord's head was black, curly, soft and smooth like a bee, appearing like the waves of the Yamuna river. The skin of the Lord's body, white and smooth like the womb of a white arsenic, seemed as if it were smeared with liquid gold. On the Lord's body, unique black hairs, soft and like the color of a bee, finer than lotus filaments, were growing. The Lord's breath was odorless, like the fragrance of a blooming lotus, and the flesh was red, and the blood was white like a stream of cow's milk. Thus, just as the ocean is served by gems, so too was the Lord, made of a treasure trove of extraordinary and diverse qualities, not served by whom?

Description of Rishabha Kumar's Marriage - Once, while playing naturally due to his childhood, a young couple came under a palm tree. As if lightning had suddenly struck an castor oil plant, a large palm fruit fell on the head of that couple at that time due to misfortune. As a result, he immediately died an untimely death.

## The Coronation of King Rishabha

**Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verse 10**

The young girl, bereaved of her partner, was like a doe, bewildered and lost. The untimely death of her beloved, like a thunderbolt in the sky, left the other couples stunned and confused. They brought the girl, now alone, to the Nabhikulkar, asking, "What should we do with this girl now?" He suggested, "This girl shall become the wife of Rishabha Kumar."  Hearing this, everyone's faces lit up with joy.  When the girl accepted, her moon-like face blossomed like the moon, and her eyes opened like lotuses.  Knowing that the auspicious deeds of her past life were bearing fruit, they chose an auspicious day for the wedding.  The divine family, led by Indra, arrived to celebrate the union.  The Devas, in that very moment, created a magnificent pavilion, adorned with golden pillars and jeweled statues, with numerous entrances and exits.  The pavilion was so resplendent, draped in white and divine fabrics, that it seemed as if the Milky Way had descended from the sky to witness its beauty.  Toranas, made of rows of leaves, were erected in all four directions, resembling bows crafted by Kamadeva.  Four jeweled kalashas, filled with the essence of love, were placed in each direction by the Devis, high in the sky.  At the entrance of the pavilion, clouds rained down fragrant garments, while the Devis anointed the ground with sandalwood paste, played music, and sang auspicious songs.  The celestial maidens echoed their melodies, creating a symphony of joy.  Indra Maharaj, along with the auspicious Sumangala and Sunanda, performed the ceremony of the Lord's hand-holding.

After the wedding, Sumangala Devi, blessed by the Devas, gave birth to the couple Bharat and Brahmi.  Sunanda Devi, bringing joy to all three realms, gave birth to the mighty Bahubali and the beautiful Sundari.  Sumangala Devi then gave birth to forty pairs of strong and valiant men, all of whom surpassed the Devas in their divine forms.

One day, all the couples gathered, raising their hands and calling out to the Nabhikulkar, "Injustice has been done, injustice has been done!  Those who commit wrong deeds no longer heed the beautiful principles of Hakaar, Makaar, and Dhikkaar."  Hearing this, the Nabhikulkar addressed the couples, "Rishabha will protect you from this injustice.  Therefore, follow his commands."  At that time, following the Nabhikulkar's instructions, three wise beings instructed the couples, "Only a king can stop those who break the rules.  Therefore, he should be seated on a high throne and crowned with water."  Hearing the words of the wise beings, the couples, following their instructions, went to the reservoir to collect water in leaf bowls.  At that moment, Indra's throne began to move, indicating that the time for the Lord's coronation had arrived.  Indra Maharaj arrived and seated the Lord on a throne adorned with jewels, crowning him with a crown and other ornaments.  The couples, with folded hands and bowls of pure water, arrived, their hearts as pure as the water they carried.  The Lord, crowned and adorned with ornaments, seated on the throne, resembled the sun shining on Mount Meru.  His white garments shone like the clouds of autumn in the sky.  On either side of him, beautiful, white chamaras, like fresh butter and swans, waved gently.

**The Construction and Description of Vinita Nagari**

Seeing the crowned Lord, the couples were filled with wonder.  Thinking that it was not appropriate to pour water on the head of such a magnificent being, they poured the water on the Lord's lotus feet.  Seeing this, Indra Maharaj, filled with joy, commanded Kubera to build Vinita Nagari, a city twelve yojanas long and nine yojanas wide.  Indra then returned to his abode.  Kubera, following the command, built Vinita Nagari, a city adorned with jewels like a crown, invincible on earth, which later became known as Ayodhya.

**The Lord**

## Description of the Kingdom - A Request by the Lokantik Devas

**Chapter 1, First Light, Verse 10**

Kubera, the lord of wealth, built that city and filled it with inexhaustible jewels, clothes, and grains. The palaces, made of diamonds, sapphires, and vaidurya gems, cast various colored rays in the sky, creating paintings without walls. The fortresses were adorned with brilliant ruby pinnacles, serving as mirrors for the celestial beings. Wealth flowed into every house in the city. They had made swastikas of pearls, with which young girls played freely like pebbles. In the city's gardens, the tops of tall trees brushed against the celestial chariots, making them seem like bird nests for a while. The heaps of large, tall gems in the city's markets and palaces made Mount Rohana look like a pile of mud. There, the women, engrossed in water sports, shone like the Tamraparni river due to the scattered pearls from their broken necklaces. The city was inhabited by great wealthy people. It seemed as if even Kubera, the merchant prince, had come to do business with one of them. At night, the water flowing from the walls of the palaces made of Chandrakanta gems washed away the dust from the paths. In that same city, there were millions of wells, ponds, lakes, and new amritakunds, filled with sweet, nectar-like water, surpassing even the Nagaloka.

**Description of the Governance**

King Rishabha adorned that city and nurtured his subjects like his own sons. For the welfare of the people, King Rishabha taught his subjects five arts, each with twenty variations. For the stability of the kingdom, he gathered cows, horses, elephants, etc., and made them domesticated. He also taught the art of statecraft, which included strategies like Sama, Dama, etc. He taught his eldest son, Bharata, seventy-two arts. Bharata, in turn, taught those arts to his brothers, his sons, and other men. King Rishabha taught Bhallata the various characteristics of elephants, horses, women, and men. He taught his daughter Brahmi eighteen scripts with her right hand and his daughter Sundari mathematics with her left hand. After that, he established the Varna system and implemented the path of justice. In this way, Shri Rishabhdev, the son of Nabhi, completed eighty-three lakh years of his life.

**The Request of the Lokantik Devas**

Once, in the month of Vaishakh, at the insistence of his family, King Rishabha went to a garden that was like a dwelling built by Kamadeva for him. Seeing the blooming mango blossoms, the Lord was filled with joy. The bees hummed, as if welcoming the Lord. It was as if Vasantalakshmi had manifested in the garden. The cuckoo sang in five notes, as if acting as the sutradhar of a play, introducing the scene. The wind made the creepers dance. The gentle, fragrant Malaya breeze made the Lord seem as if he were sitting in a flower house, adorned with flower ornaments, holding a flower staff in his hand. Seeing the group of women gathered around the branches of the trees, curious to pick flowers, it seemed as if these trees were filled with female fruits. Thus, the Lord became so adorned in that garden, as if he were the spring itself. There, many children were playing happily. Seeing them, the Lord thought, "Is the play of the Douguindak Devas like this?" At that time, the Lord, using his knowledge of the past, contemplated the pleasures of his previous births in the Uttara Devaloka, and delved deeper into the experience of the known pleasures of the higher Devalokas. The Lord's attachments were destroyed, so he immediately changed his thoughts, thinking, "He who does not understand his own self-interest gets trapped in these worldly pleasures." "Shame on that soul who, like the bells of a well-wheel, keeps going up and down in various high and low places due to karma, in this well of the world." Thus, diving into the ocean of thought, the Lord's mind turned away from the world. At that moment, the Lokantik Devas, including Sarasvat, arrived to serve the Lord. They bowed with folded hands and prayed to the Lord, "Lord! Now, please establish the pilgrimage." After the Devas left, the Lord returned to the city from the Nandan garden and summoned the kings. He organized a ceremony and, in the presence of all the kings, crowned his eldest son, Bharata, as king. After that, the Lord distributed the kingdom to his sons, including Bhallata. Then, he gave charity for a year (Samvatsari), so that there would be no begging in the earth, no one would have to say, "Give me." The thrones of all the Indras trembled, so they came there and, like rain falling on a mountain, they performed the Lord's abhisheka. They showered him with garlands of flowers, fragrant

Rishabhdev's initiation, the arrival of Nami and Vinami

The Lord was adorned with fragrant garlands of flowers, established by the Angaragas and the Devas, as if he were shining with his own white glory. Dressed in various garments and adorned with jeweled ornaments, the Lord shone like the evening clouds in the sky or like the sky illuminated by the stars. Indra beat the Dundubhi in the sky, and it seemed as if he were sharing his joy with the world, leaping from his soul. The Lord's initiation ceremony was performed in a palanquin carried by the Devas, Danavas, and humans, as an excuse to show the world the path of upward progress; the spectators, seeing it with unwavering eyes, considered their eyes fulfilled.

From there, reaching the garden called Siddhartha, the Lord completely renounced flowers and ornaments like kṣayās, and plucked his hair with four fists, later plucking it with a fifth fist. Then Indra prayed, "Lord! Your golden, indescribable locks of hair are beautiful, so let them remain as they are." Hearing this, the Lord let them remain as they were. Saudharma Indra took the Lord's hair in his Uttarasanga garment and placed it in the Kṣīrasamudra and returned. Indra, like a Natyacharya, stopped the noise that was happening in the assembly with a gesture of his fist and clap. "I renounce all sinful tendencies for the rest of my life," the Lord said, and mounted the chariot of excellent character to embark on the path of liberation. At that time, the Lord attained Manahparyaya-jnana, by which he could know the mental substances of all beings. Four thousand kings who followed their master also embraced the path; for this is the conduct of noble men. After that, all the Indras returned to their respective places. Just as the leader of the herd walks with the elephants, so the Lord wandered with those four thousand Manis. At that time, the good people were unaware of the method of offering alms to the Lord, so when they went to their homes for alms, the emotional men and women presented them with pearls, jewels, elephants, horses, etc. Truly, simplicity sometimes becomes disdainful. Due to the simplicity and ignorance of the simple-minded people, the Lord did not receive suitable alms, so he did not accept those unimaginable things, but returned. The Lord silently endured this situation with humility. But seeing the Lord's austere and unbearable conduct, marked by silent endurance, his 4000 hungry disciples, who were wandering with him, left him. They all donned the garb of ascetics and sustained themselves by eating wild fruits and flowers. Who else could be as strong-willed as the Lord? Thus, frightened by the hardships, they had abandoned the royal path of liberation and set foot on the wrong path.

Meanwhile, Nami and Vinami, the sons of Kachchha and Mahakachchha, who had gone according to the Lord's command, came to the meditating Lord and both bowed to him and prayed, "Lord! We have no master other than you; therefore, please give us back our kingdom." The Lord remained silent, giving them no answer. The selfless, ruthless great man stays away from the world's machinations. Seeing the Lord's silence, both of them, from that day on, stood guard in the service of their master, with naked swords in their hands. They seemed like the sun and moon around Mount Meru. At that time, Dharanendra came to pay homage to the Lord. He asked them, "What is the purpose of your coming here?" In reply, they said, "This is our master. We are his servants. When he was king, he sent us out on some business. Later, he distributed his kingdom to all his sons. We returned, and by then he had become a muni. Now it is clear to us that he has renounced everything, so where will he give us the kingdom? We are not at all concerned about whether he has anything or not. A servant must always serve his master. Therefore, we are stationed in his service." Dharanendra said, "This master is devoid of affection and non-possessive. It would have been good if you had gone to Bharatji and asked for the kingdom. What can this sadhu give you?" To this, they replied, "Having found the Lord, the master of the universe, we do not want to make anyone else our master. Having found the Kalpavriksha, who would seek shelter in the Karira (kar) tree? We do not go to anyone else to ask for anything except God. The Chatak

Dharanendra giving knowledge, taking food
Yoga Shastra First Light Verse 10

Except for the year-long fast, he does not ask for water from anyone else. Thus, may the welfare of Bharata and others be! Do not worry about us. Whatever we need will be given to us by these Swamis. What do we have to do with others?' Hearing their selfless reply, Dharanendra was astonished and pleased. He said, 'I am also a servant of these Swamis, Dharanendra, the lord of the netherworld. Your pledge is excellent. You should serve these Swamis. Look, I am pleased with your devotion to the Swamis and I grant you the wealth of the Vidyadharas as a result of your service to the Swamis. This has come to you only through your service to the Swamis. Do not think that it has come from anyone else.' Thus, after explaining to them, Dharanendra taught them the knowledge of Prajnapti, etc.

Pleased with this, they both came to the Vaitalya mountain, which was fifty yojanas wide and twenty-five yojanas high, as per the Swamis' command. There, Vinamikumar, with the power of knowledge, established fifty cities, each ten yojanas wide, in the middle of the southern range of the earth. Similarly, Vidyadharapati Vinamikumar established sixty cities, each ten yojanas wide, in the northern range. There, for a long time, they both ruled happily as the kings of the Vidyadharas. It is true that 'service to the Swamis does not go in vain.'

One year had passed since Rishabhdev Bhagwan had remained silent and without food. While wandering in search of a suitable food, he arrived in Hastinapur with the desire to break his fast. At that time, Shreyanskumar, the son of Somayasha, had a dream: 'I washed the Meru mountain, which was black, with pots of nectar and made it bright.' Seth named Subuddhi also had a dream: 'Thousands of rays fell from the sun, which Shreyanskumar re-established in his place, making the sun bright again.' King Somayasha also had a dream: 'A king was surrounded by many enemies, but with the help of Shreyans, he won.' All three narrated their dreams to each other in the royal court. But, not knowing the fruit of their dreams, they returned to their respective places. At that time, as if to give a direct decision on the fruit of that dream, Bhagwan arrived at Shreyans' place for alms. Just as the sea starts to churn when it sees the moon, so too, Shreyans, the recipient of blessings, danced with joy at the sight of Bhagwan. As soon as Shreyanskumar saw the Swami, he thought to himself, and from this, he gained the knowledge of remembering his past life, like a lost treasure. All the things of his past life began to appear before him like a moving picture: in his previous life, he was the Chakravarti Vajranabha, and he was his charioteer. He had also taken initiation at that time. Therefore, the intelligent Shreyanskumar remembered the method of giving alms without fault. He gave the Lord Prasook Ikshu-rasa, suitable for breaking the fast. Although there was a lot of juice, it fit into the Lord's hand-bowl. At that time, joy did not fit in Shreyans' heart. That same juice, as if solidified in the offering, became a tall, crested one, taking it to the sky (upper world), because the influence of great men is incomprehensibly powerful. The Lord drank the Ikshu-rasa, and the Asuras and humans also partook of the nectar of the Lord's sight. In the sky, the gods rained down jewels and flowers like rain, with a thunderous sound like clouds. After this, the Lord went on a tour and arrived in Takshashila, the capital of King Bahubali. He meditated in the garden outside the city for one night.

Bahubali thought, 'I will see the Swami in the morning and make others see him, purifying their eyes.' When will it be morning, and when will I reach the Lord to see him?' In this anxiety, the night seemed like a month. When Bahubali reached there in the morning, the Lord had gone elsewhere. Seeing the garden dull like a moonless sky, he thought to himself, 'Just as seeds are destroyed on uneven ground, so too, the desires of my heart have been destroyed. Shame on me, the careless one.' Saying this, Bahubali began to self-reproach. At the place where the Lord was standing in meditation, Bahubali made a platform of jewels and a bright Dharmachakra with a thousand eyes like the sun. Wearing various ornaments, the Swami wandered in the land of the Mlechchas, just as he did in the land of the Aryas. Yogis are always equanimous. By the Lord's wandering, even the sinful people there became more steadfast in their faith. 1. There is also a mention that Dharanendra entered the Lord's mouth and gave him knowledge. 2. There is also a mention that Bahubali shouted loudly.

The Lord attained Kevalgyan, Bharat's contemplation,
The first chapter of Yogashastra, verse 10, became. In this way, while wandering, a thousand years had passed for the Lord. While wandering, once the Lord arrived in the city of Purimatal (Ayodhya). In the northeast corner of the city was a grove called Shaktal. There, under a banyan tree, he remained stable in Kayotsarga (meditation) by performing Atthamatap. The Lord ascended the Kshapak श्रेणी and reached the middle of the pure white meditation in the order of Aapuurvakaran, and then he shattered his karmic deeds like clouds, from which the sun of Kevalgyan manifested in the Lord's Atma Pradesh.

At that time, due to extreme crowding in the sky path, the planes started colliding with each other. Thus, sixty-four Indras came there along with many gods. The Vayukumar gods, who cleanse the earth, cleaned the place of the Lord's Samavasaran and made it level. The Meghkumar gods rained fragrant water there, which settled the dust there. The gods spread flowers of six seasons on the earth up to the knees. Truly, the contact of the revered ones is only for worship. The Vahnikumar gods made the land of Samavasaran fragrant with fragrant incense, making the entire sky fragrant. The creation of Samavasaran adorned with colorful Ratnakanti by Indra and the gods looked as if hundreds of rainbows had come together. The Bhavanpati, Jyotishka and Vaimanika gods built three forts there of silver, gold and ruby. The flags fluttering on the fort seemed to be informing the beings that this path is of heaven, this path is of liberation. The fort was adorned with statues of Vidyaadharis made of gems. The gods did not allow them to enter the Samavasaran, thinking that perhaps the inclusion would not be possible inside. The enchanted divine women, delighted, kept looking at the ruby pinnacles for a long time. Each fort had four doors adorned like four windows of four types. The gods built a Kalpavriksha three kos high on the land of Samavasaran, which seemed to be indicating the three jewels of Samyagdarshan etc. Under the same tree, a throne made of gems with a superior footstool was built in the east direction; which was giving the beauty of heaven. The Lord entered from the east direction and bowed to the Tirth (Sangha) saying 'Namo Tithass'. The Lord, like the sun who removes darkness on the eastern mountain, was seated on that throne established in the east direction. At the same time, the gods established the image of the Lord on the throne in the remaining three directions. Above the Lord, three umbrellas, which were removing the beauty of the full moon, and the symbol of ownership of the three worlds, were shining. In front of the Lord, a gem-studded Indra flag was shining so brightly, as if Indra was raising one hand high, indicating that the Lord is the only one who is our master. The Dharmachakra, adorned with an extremely wonderful group of lights, was shining in front of the Lord, as if it was indicating the Lord's Chakravartitva on the Kevalgyanis. Two chamaras, as bright and beautiful as the white waves of the Ganges river, seemed like swans running towards the Lord's lotus face. The sun also seemed like a firefly child in front of the Bhamandala that appeared behind the Lord's body. The Dundubhi resounding in the sky was as deep as thunder. It was echoing in all directions with its reverberation. The gods rained flowers with petals drooping down all around at that time. It seemed as if Kamadeva had abandoned his other weapons on those who had attained power. The Lord began to preach Dharma with a voice endowed with thirty-five qualities, which benefited (saved) the three worlds.

At that time, a messenger came and requested King Bharat - 'Swamin! Lord Rishabh has attained Kevalgyan.' Another messenger came and informed - 'A Chakra Ratna has appeared in your armory.' 'On the one hand, my father has attained Kevalgyan, on the other hand, I have received the Chakra Ratna, which of the two should I worship first?' Bharat Nrip remained in this dilemma for a moment. In the next moment, he thought clearly that where is my father who gives protection to the beings of the world and where is this chakra which destroys the beings! Thus, deciding, he ordered his family to go to worship the Lord. Hearing the news of the calamities coming upon his son, Bharat bowed to his grandmother Marudevi, who had become blind due to constantly shedding tears of sorrow, and prayed - 'Grandmother! You always used to reproach me that my delicate son suffers the trouble of water like the lotus grove in the monsoon and cold

Rishabha Prabhu's teachings, Marudeva's liberation, establishment of the order

In the first chapter of the Yoga Shastra, verse 10, it is said that in the forest, due to snowfall, he experiences the state of distress like the pillar of Malati, and in the summer, he experiences excessive heat from the scorching rays of the sun like an elephant. In this way, my forest-dwelling son is always alone, without shelter, suffering like a lowly person in all seasons. Therefore, if you want to see the prosperity of your son who has attained the ownership of the three worlds, let's go.' Thus saying, the mother, who was as happy as Lakshmi herself, was seated on an elephant, adorned with ornaments of gold, diamonds, and rubies, and Bharat set out towards the Samvasaran with elephants, horses, chariots, and infantry. While going with the army, King Bharat saw from afar a gem-studded flag, like a moving torana, with ornaments gathered together in front. Seeing this, Bharat said to his mother Marudevi, 'Grandmother! Look, this is the Samvasaran prepared by the gods for the Lord! Here, the cries of victory of the gods who have come to celebrate the service of my father's lotus feet are echoing. And the teachings of the Lord, pure and filled with nectar for the ears, are being heard from the villages of Malakosh, etc. Listen attentively with wonder, grandmother, to the voice of the Lord, sweeter than the voices of peacocks, cranes, herons, swans, and other birds. Grandmother! My father's voice, as deep as the sound of thunder, travels for yojanas, and my mind, like a cloud, rushes towards it.' Mother Marudevi listened with joy to the deep voice of the Lord of the three worlds, who was as steady as a lamp in the void, the savior of the world. Her eyes were cleansed by the tears of joy, and she could see. She saw the power of the great Tirthankara Rishabhadev. Seeing him, her attachment ended. Her actions were extinguished by the stability of joy. At that very moment, she attained omniscience. And at that very moment, she completed her lifespan and departed to liberation. In this descending time, Mother Marudevi was the first to become liberated and perfected. After that, the gods cast her earthly body into the sea and celebrated the Nirvana festival there. Knowing that his grandmother had attained liberation, King Bharat felt both joy and sorrow, just as the shadow of autumn clouds and the heat of the sun are both present.

Thereafter, Bharat Chakravarti, abandoning the royal insignia, entered the Samvasaran on foot with his family. King Bharat, with eyes like a cuckoo, gazed intently at the Lord, surrounded by the four divine groups, like the moon, and circumambulated the Lord three times and bowed down. Then, with his hands folded above his head, he began to praise the Lord: 'O Lord of the entire universe! Victory to you; O giver of protection to the entire world! Victory to you; O first Jineshwara! Victory to you, O savior of the world! Victory to you! O Lord, like the sun, you have awakened the lotus of the glorious beings of this descending time. Today, by seeing you, darkness has been destroyed, and dawn has arrived. O Lord! Your words are like pure water that purifies the minds of the glorious beings, like pure water. O ocean of compassion! Whoever mounts your chariot of rule, liberation is not far away for him. O God! The world where one sees the real form of the uncaused savior is considered by us to be greater than liberation. O Lord! By seeing you, my eyes, fixed in great bliss, experience the taste of liberation even in the world. O Lord, the giver of protection! You alone will save the world, which is surrounded by enemies in the form of attachment, aversion, and passions. O Lord! You yourself understand the truth. You alone show the path to liberation. You yourself protect the world. Therefore, Lord! Whom else should I praise now, except you?' Thus, Bharat Chakravarti praised the Lord, made his two ears into cups, and drank the nectar of the teachings. At that time, Rishabhasen and the other eighty-four Ganadharas were also initiated by Lord Rishabhadev. After that, the Lord initiated the five sons of Brahmi and Bharat Chakravarti, and seven hundred grandsons, into the Bhagavati order. In this way, at that time, the Lord established the fourfold order. In the fourfold order of Lord Rishabhadev, the chief were the sadhus like Pundarik, the sadhvis like Brahmi, the shravaks like Shreyans, and the shravikas like Sundari. From that time till today, this order has continued in the same way. Thereafter, the Lord, along with his disciples, went to other places to awaken the glorious beings. Bharatnaresh also bowed to the Lord and returned to Ayodhya.

## The Conquest of the Six Regions by Bharat

**Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verse 10**

_The ocean of the lineage of Rishabhdeva, like the moon, was delighted by the embodiment of justice, the glorious King Bharat. Lakshmi Devi was his servant in the presence of his beauty. He had sixty-four thousand queens. When King Bharat sat on the half-seat with Indra, the gods, unable to understand the difference, were filled with doubt._

Like the sun, the world's light, rising in the east, the radiant King Bharat, whose brilliance eclipsed others, set out from the east to conquer the world. He arrived at the eastern seashore, made beautiful by the confluence of the Ganga, where the waves, like hands, tossed the flow, as if throwing wealth. There, remembering the Kumardeva of Magadha Tirtha, the Chakravarti embraced the eight tapas, the first door to wealth. Then, seated in his chariot, the mighty-armed Bharat Chakravarti entered the vast ocean, like Mount Meru. Keeping the chariot upright in the water, he sent his arrow, marked with his name, like his messenger, towards Magadha, twelve yojanas away. The arrow fell in Magadha. Seeing it, the King of Magadha frowned and became extremely angry. But as soon as the Naga Kumar saw the name of Bharat Chakravarti on the arrow, like a mantra, his mind became calm. "This must be the first Chakravarti born," he thought, and came to Bharat like the embodiment of victory. He brought back the arrow, like the jewel on his head and the brilliance he had earned over time, to the Chakravarti and said, "I am your servant. I am the protector of the eastern direction. Tell me, what task can I do for you?" Hearing this request, the mighty Bharat accepted him as the King of Magadha, like a victory pillar.

From there, the King Bharat, shaking the earth and mountains with his four-armed army, reached the southern sea from the eastern seashore. The mighty-armed Bharat set up camp on this seashore, where the coastal islands produce pistachios, cashews, and other things in abundance. The glorious Bharat, like a second sun, with his hidden brilliance, mounted a chariot drawn by horses. Then, seated in that chariot, drawn by high-spirited horses like leaping waves, he took the chariot into the sea, up to its navel. Then, Bharat, drawing the bowstring to his ear, made the sound of the bow like the Om of the Dhanurveda. Then, the powerful Bharat, like Indra, placed a golden arrow, like a golden earring, like a lotus stalk, marked with his own name, on the bow and released it towards the lord of Varadam Tirtha. The lord of Varadam Tirtha saw the arrow and caught it. He knew its purpose. Therefore, he came to Bharat with offerings. With folded hands, he said to Bharat, "You have graced my place, making me fulfilled. By obtaining a lord like you, I have become a lord." Then, making him his subordinate king, the appreciative Bharat, shaking the earth with his army, moved towards the western direction.

Reaching the western seashore, King Bharat also threw a blazing arrow, like a thunderbolt, towards the lord of Prabhas Tirtha. Prabhaspati read the inscription on the arrow: "If you wish to live happily, obey my command and also give me tribute." Reading this, he came to Bharat with abundant offerings, to please the King. He offered Bharat, the crown of men, a beautiful garland of jewels, white like snow, and the best of jewels, the Kaustubha gem, and a unique gem, as well as a crown shining with Kaustubha gems and gold, like the embodiment of brilliance, and pleased him with his sincere devotion. From there, King Bharat set out towards the Sindhu River, like the threshold of the northern gate. There, near the temple of Sindhu Devi, the king set up camp.

To invoke Sindhu Devi, he performed severe tapas. Sindhu Devi, sensing the arrival of a Chakravarti by the trembling of her seat, came with divine offerings. She worshipped King Bharat. King Bharat accepted her offerings and dismissed her. He then broke his fast and celebrated his victory for eight days. Then, following the cycle, he went to the northeast, to the city of Vidisha, and reached the Vaithadya mountain, which connects the two divisions of Bharat Kshetra. There, Bharat set up camp at the foot of the southern division. Here also...

## Bharat's Conquest of the Six Regions

**Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verse 10**

Bharat, the king, performed the eighth *attham* penance with the aim of conquering Vaithaḍya Kumar Dev. Through his *avadhi* knowledge, he learned of the dev's strength and, accordingly, presented him with gifts. Vaithaḍya Kumar Dev accepted Bharat's sovereignty and was then dismissed. Bharat then performed the *parana* of the eighth *attham* penance and celebrated the *Ashtahnika* festival in his honor.

After this, Bharat, radiant like the sun, arrived near the cave of Tamisra and set up his camp nearby. He performed the eighth *attham* penance with the aim of conquering Krtimal Dev. The dev's seat trembled, and he came forth to accept Bharat's sovereignty. Bharat dismissed him, performed the *parana* of the eighth *attham* penance, and celebrated the *Ashtahnika* festival in his honor.

On Bharat's command, his general, Susheṇ, crossed the Sindhu river with the help of the *charmaratna* and conquered Nishkut, the ruler of South Sindhu.

Bharat, son of Rishabha, ordered Susheṇ to open the cave of Tamisra, which was blocked by a vajra-kapaṭ (diamond door) in the Vaithaḍya mountain. Susheṇ, with reverence for his master's command, went to the region near the Tamisra cave. With a pure mind, he performed the eighth *attham* penance in the *paushadhashala* (medicine room) to remember Krtimal Dev, the guardian of the cave.

After completing the eighth *attham* penance, Susheṇ bathed and cleansed himself internally and externally. He then donned pure garments and various ornaments. He then took a *dhoopadani* (incense burner) filled with burning fire, like a *homakunda* (sacrificial fire pit), and, with his fists, offered incense like a sacrifice to the self. He then cautiously approached the cave entrance, like a storehouse door, and prepared to open it quickly. He saw the double doors and bowed to them, for how else could he enter? He then marked eight auspicious symbols on the cave entrance and celebrated the *Aṭṭhai* festival.

After this, the general, in accordance with his glory, took the *dandaratna* (a weapon made of a precious stone), like a vajra that destroys all enemies. He then stepped back a few steps, like a *vakragrha* (a celestial body that moves in a retrograde motion), and struck the door three times with the *dandaratna*. Just as a vajra cuts through the wings of a mountain, the *dandaratna* shattered the two doors with a loud crack.

As the cave entrance opened, Susheṇ jumped with joy. He bowed to Bharat, the emperor, and said, "O King! Just as the doors of liberation open for a *yati* (ascetic) through intense penance, so too has the cave door opened without any obstacle due to your influence."

Hearing this, Bharat, like Indra on his elephant Airavaṇ, mounted his elephant Gandhasti and proceeded towards the cave entrance. To dispel the darkness of the cave, he placed a *maniratna* (gemstone) on the right tusk of his elephant, which shone like the sun in the east. With this light, he could see for a yojana (a unit of distance) in both directions. Like the sun in the clouds, Bharat entered the cave. His army followed behind, and the *chakra* (wheel) led the way.

Bharat's servants illuminated the cave by marking circles of *kakiniratna* (a type of gemstone) in the shape of *gomutrika* (a type of cow urine) every yojana in both directions. These circles shone like the sun, and the light of these 49 illuminated circles allowed Bharat's army to proceed comfortably.

On the way, Bharat saw two rivers in the cave, named Unmanna and Nimanna. One river carried stones, while the other drowned a *tumba* (a type of gourd). He crossed these difficult rivers by creating a path with the *vardhki-ratna* (a type of gemstone), and emerged from the cave like the sun emerging from a cloud.

From there, Bharat entered the Uttarakhaṇḍ of Bharatkshetra. Like Indra fighting the demons, Bharat fought the Mlechchhas and defeated them. The Mlechchhas, with the aim of conquering Bharat, worshipped their own gods, including Meghakumar. Due to their influence, a torrential downpour began, like the deluge.

To protect himself, Bharat spread out the *charmaratna* (a type of leather) for twelve yojanas and placed the *chattraratna* (a type of umbrella) on top. He stationed his army in the middle. To dispel the darkness caused by the storm, he placed a *maniratna* on the *chattrdanda* (umbrella staff), which shone like the sun in the east. The *charmaratna* and *chattraratna*, both floating like eggs, were a sight to behold. Perhaps this is how the concept of the universe began in the world.

Bharat had a *grihapatiratna* (a type of gemstone) that could make seeds sown in the morning grow and mature by evening. This allowed Bharat to provide food for everyone in his entourage.

Meanwhile, the Mlechchha god Meghakumar, exhausted from the rain, said to his followers, ...

## Bharat's Conquest of the Six Continents

**Chapter 1 of the Yoga Shastra, Verse 10:** "This is Bharat Chakravarti. He cannot be conquered by someone like us." Disheartened by Meghakumar's words, the Mlechchha people sought refuge in Bharatesh. Truly, "Fire is the medicine for that which is ignited by fire." Just as a Yogi conquers the world, similarly, the invincible Nishkut, situated north of the Sindhu River, was conquered by the army under the command of the Lord. 

Traveling with the joy of an Airavata elephant, Bharatesh reached the southern foothills of the Ksudrahimalaya mountain. There, he performed the Atthama Tapa for the purpose of the Ksudrahimalaya Kumar Dev. "Tapa is the first auspicious act for the fulfillment of work." After his Atthama Tapa, the King of Kings, Bharat, went to the Himalayas and, while seated in his chariot, struck the mountain three times with the end of his chariot. He then released an arrow, marked with his name, which traveled 72 yojanas and landed on the peak of the mountain. Upon seeing the arrow, the Himalayan Kumar appeared before Bharatesh. He accepted his command as a crown upon his head. 

Then, the son of Rishabha, Bharatesh, reached the Rishabhakut mountain and, approaching it, struck it three times with the end of his chariot, like the tusk of an Airavata elephant. In the middle of the mountain, he inscribed with Kakini gems, "I am Bharat Chakravarti, born in the last part of the third Ara of the Avasarpini Kal." After that, he returned to his camp and performed the Parana of the Atthama Tapa. Then, the Chakravarti, in accordance with his wealth, celebrated the Atthais Mahotsav in honor of the Ksudrahimalaya Kumar Dev. 

After that, the Chakravarti Bharat, following the path of his Chakra, traveled with his great army, crossing the distance between the Sindhu and Ganga rivers, and returned. Gradually, they reached the foothills of the Vaitalya mountain in the north. There, the army and family settled down comfortably. After a few days, they sent an arrow to the Vidyaadharas, the rulers of that region, demanding their submission to their Lord. Angered by the demand for submission, both Vidyaadharas descended from the Vaitalya mountain and, with their army, came to fight Bharatesh. At that time, Bharat saw that the sky was filled with lightning, illuminated by the many suns, and resonated with the thunderous roar of drums, as the Vidyaadharas' army launched projectiles from their gem-encrusted flying machines. They challenged Bharat to battle, "Oh, you who demand submission! If you want to take submission from us, then come to the battlefield." 

Throwing his vast army into battle, Bharatesh fought various battles with them. Victory cannot be achieved without fighting. Finally, after fighting for 12 years, the Vidyaadharapatis, Nami and Vinami, were defeated. After their defeat, they folded their hands in salutation and said to Bharat Raja, "Just as there is no one brighter than the sun, no one faster than the wind, and no happiness greater than Moksha, similarly, there is no warrior greater than you. Oh, Bharatnaresh! Seeing you today, we have seen Rishabhdev Bhagwan himself. Master! We fought with you out of ignorance. Please forgive us. Your command will now be on our heads like a crown. This wealth, treasure, body, sons, etc., are all yours." 

Speaking these words of devotion, the extremely humble Vinami offered his daughter (a gem among women) and Nami offered a treasure of gems. Taking permission, both of them crowned their sons as kings and, with a sense of detachment, went to Bhagwan Rishabhdev and took initiation. 

After that, following the Chakra Ratna, they reached the banks of the Ganga River. The army commander, Sushen, conquered the Uttar Pradesh region bordering the Ganga. What is impossible for a great soul? The king performed the Atthama Tapa and worshipped Ganga Devi. The goddess also presented divine offerings and honored Bharat. The entire bank of the Ganga was fragrant with the scent of lotus. Bharatesh built a palace-like Patbhavan on the banks of the Ganga and resided there. Seeing the beauty of Bharat, like that of Kamadeva, the Ganga River was thrilled. Adorned with pearl ornaments and fine clothes, like the thin membrane inside a banana, the moon-faced Ganga Devi approached Bharatesh. Assuming a form filled with flowing water, she gracefully moved her limbs and gestures, and with a voice filled with love, she pleaded with the king. Then, with a desire to engage in love play, she took him to her abode. There, with Bharatnaresh, she indulged in various pleasures and luxuries. 

1. While erasing a name and writing his own, a tear fell from Bharatesh's eye. He thought, "I am erasing the name of a Chakravarti. In the future, someone will erase my name too." This is also mentioned.

## Bharat's Message to His 98 Brothers

Days and nights like gold began to pass. A thousand years passed like a single day. Just as an elephant moves from one forest to another, Bharat Raja, bidding farewell to Gangadevi, reached the Khandprapaat cave. There, like Krtimalayaksha, he performed Attham Tapa and worshipped Natyamal, celebrating an eight-day festival in the same manner. Then, Sushena, the commander, opened the door of the cave and entered. Thus, the southern door opened on its own. From the middle of that cave, Bharat Chakravarti emerged like a Kesari lion. He set up camp on the western bank of the Ganga. At the time the Chakravarti reached the banks of the Ganga, the nine Nidhis, presided over by the Naga Kumar Dev, appeared and said, "O Great One! We reside in Magadhdesh at the mouth of the Ganga and, attracted by your fortune, we have come here to you. Use us as you wish or donate us. Perhaps the water in the ocean can run out, but our wealth can never be depleted. Our length is 12 yojanas and our width is 9 yojanas. Even though we are so vast, we will always remain at your service like a watchman. We will also accompany you underground. We are established on eight chakras and assure you that our 9,000 obedient Yakshas will always replenish your treasures." Just as the wind makes a great forest desolate, so too did Sushena, the commander, make the southern region of the Ganga desolate and returned. In this way, after conquering six continents in sixty thousand years, Bharat Chakravarti, with his army, reached Ayodhya, following the designated path. For twelve years, kings from far and wide came and accepted Bharat Maharaja's Chakravartihood.

One day, Bharat Chakravarti, seeing his sister Sundari, who cared for his family, weak and with bones protruding, angrily said to his close servants, "Servants! Is there a shortage of food here? Then why is this woman of my family reduced to mere bones? Is she not given nourishing food?" The servants replied, "Master! Ever since you went on your victory march, she has been observing a Parana-less Achaml (Ayambil) tapa, desiring to take initiation. At that time, the news came that "Lord Rishabhdev, while wandering the earth, has arrived at the Ashtapad mountain." Hearing this, Chakravarti Bharat, taking Sundari with him, went to pay his respects to the Lord. Following the Lord's teachings, Sundari, with the Chakravarti's permission, took initiation. Meanwhile, preparations were underway for the Chakravarti's coronation ceremony. Bharatesh sent messengers to all the concerned kings, conveying the message, "If they want their kingdom safe and sound, they should accept the authority of Chakravarti Bharat and come to serve him." Hearing this, all the kings accepted his authority, except for Bharat's 98 brothers. They discussed among themselves and sent a message to Bharat through a messenger, saying, "As brothers, we are ready to serve him, but we are not willing to accept his authority and give him the kingdom. Our father gave us the kingdom. What more will we get by serving Bharat? When Yama Raja comes, will he be able to stop him? Will he be able to subdue the body that weakens? Will he be able to eliminate the suffering, the disease that hunts us? Will he be able to subdue the growing Tishna-Pishachi? If Bharat is not capable of giving the fruit of our service in this form, then we are equal to him. In what way are we inferior to him? Therefore, our humanity is equal; then who is the servant of whom? Does he want to forcibly seize the kingdom from us and increase his kingdom due to his personal dissatisfaction? This competition is not right among equal brothers. The father whose son we are, he is also his son. Therefore, messenger, tell your master, "Without our father's say, we will not fight with our elder brother, but we will not tolerate our humiliation." Saying this, the 98 brothers went to Lord Rishabhdev and, after paying their respects, informed him about the message Bharat had sent through the messenger, saying, "Father! You gave us the kingdom; how can we hand over your given kingdom to Bharat? We will follow your command according to whatever guidance you give us." Lord Rishabhdev, in the mirror of pure knowledge, saw the entire universe clearly...

## The Initiation of 98 Brothers

**Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verse 10**

It was evident, how could this remain hidden from them? Therefore, the gracious Lord, Shri Adiswar, addressed his sons, saying: "My sons! I have brought for you an extraordinary spiritual kingdom of wealth. Material wealth is fickle and breeds ego. In the end, due to its destructive nature, it leads the ruler to hell. It increases the cycle of birth and death. Even if you attain heavenly pleasures after acquiring material wealth, the thirst for such pleasures will only grow. Just as the thirst of a fire-brand does not quench, similarly, the desire for enjoyment will not be satiated in the next birth. If the thirst is not quenched by heavenly pleasures in the next life, how can it be quenched by human enjoyment, which is like a fire-brand?

**The Analogy of the Fire-Brand:**

There was a foolish man named Angaradahak who went to a deserted forest to make charcoal, carrying a water-skin filled from a pond. The heat of the fire and the scorching sun of midday doubled his thirst. Due to this, he drank all the water in the water-skin. Still, his thirst did not quench; then he fell asleep. He had a dream in which he saw himself going home and drinking all the water from the pitchers, pots, and water vessels kept in his house. Just as fire is not quenched by oil, similarly, even after drinking so much water, his thirst did not subside. Then he drank the water from wells, ponds, and other water bodies, emptying them. Still, he was not satisfied. Therefore, he went to the river; he went to the sea, drank its water too; yet, his thirst did not abate, like the torment of a hellish being. Later, he would see any water body and drink its water, emptying it. Then he reached the well of Marwar to drink its water. He tied a tuft of grass to a rope and lowered it into the well to draw water. What does a distressed man not do? The water of the Marwar well was deep, and due to drawing water from deep down, much of it would be squeezed out before reaching the top. Still, he squeezed the water drops clinging to the blades of grass and drank them. Whose thirst is not quenched even by the water of the sea; how can it be quenched by the water of a tuft of grass? This means that his thirst was not quenched in any way.

Similarly, how can the thirst of one who is not satisfied by heavenly pleasures be quenched by acquiring material wealth? Therefore, my dear sons! It is only fitting for wise men like you to attain the kingdom of restraint, which bestows bliss and leads to liberation.

Hearing this detached discourse of the Lord, those 98 brothers also became detached at that very moment and took initiation from the Lord. Meanwhile, the messenger, silently praising the patience, truthfulness, and increasing detachment of those 98 brothers, reached the king of Bharata. He informed him of all the happenings of the 98 brothers. Hearing this, the king of Bharata took possession of the kingdom of those 98 brothers. Truly, greed increases with gain (acquisition of wealth). This has always been the case in politics.

The commander-in-chief, distressed, humbly requested Bharat Chakravarti: "O King! The Chakra Ratna has not yet entered your armory. Therefore, it seems that there is still some king who does not accept your authority. And until all kings accept your authority, your conquest of the world remains incomplete for you to become a Chakravarti." Bharat replied: "Yes! I know that it remains to conquer my younger brother, the extraordinary powerful, mighty-armed, and immensely strong Bahubali. My situation is like that of a person who has a Garuda on one side and a swarm of snakes on the other. I know that Bahubali, like a lion, can defeat thousands alone; because the valor that a single lion displays, thousands of deer cannot display together. No one, be it a rival, a god, a demon, or a human, is capable of defeating the invincible Bahubali alone. A great moral dilemma has arisen before me. On the one hand, I want to become a Chakravarti, but the Chakra Ratna is not entering my armory; on the other hand, Bahubali is not willing to accept anyone's authority. What..."

The Messenger to Bahubali
Yoga Shastra First Light Verse 10

"Will Bahubali agree to obey in any way? Does a lion tolerate a burden on its back?" Bharat was pondering such thoughts when his commander said, "My Lord! In the face of your prowess, even the three worlds are like a straw." Bharat sent a messenger to his half-brother Bahubali's capital with a message. The clever messenger bowed to Bahubali, seated on a high throne, and delivered Bharat's message with reason: "O King! You are truly an admirable person, whose elder brother is the conqueror of the world, the master of the six continents of Bharat, and a superhumanly powerful being. Which king does not come to the coronation ceremony of your elder brother, the Chakravarti, with auspicious offerings and in submission? Indeed, every king has come. Just as the lotus grove is adorned by the sunrise, so is the rise of Bharat for your glory. But we are surprised why you did not come to his coronation?"

"O Kumar! The wise king has sent me to your service to know the reason for your absence; and for this purpose I have come to your service. It may be that you did not come naturally; but in such a great festival, how many people consider your absence as your rudeness, as a younger brother? Because low men always seek loopholes. We want such low people to have no chance to speak. You should pay close attention to this and defend yourself from the beginning. Therefore, we humbly request you to come to the service of your elder brother. The elder brother is the Maharaja, what is there to be ashamed of in worshipping him? Perhaps you did not come thinking, 'I am his equal brother; how can I go?' Then it will only reveal your arrogance. Obedient kings do not care about kinship. Just as iron is drawn near a magnet, so are gods, demons, and humans drawn by the brilliance and power of Bharatnaresh. At present, all kings follow only Bharat. Even Indra Maharaj has made friendship with him by giving him half the seat. Then it is not understood why you are shying away from going to his service? Perhaps you are considering yourself more valiant and defying the king, then this will be your great delusion. Your handful of army looks like a small stream in front of his army, like a small stream in front of the ocean. And he has eighty-four lakh elephants like Airavata, who can move them like movable mountains? There are as many horses and chariots, whose speed is like the storm of the apocalyptic ocean. Who can stop their speed? Then there are 98 crore villages under that Chakravarti and a foot army of 96 koti like lions; with whom he can distress whomever he wants, and they have a commander named Sushena, who holds the Danda Ratna in his hand, like Yama Raja; whose punishment even gods and Asuras cannot bear. Along with that, the Amogh Chakra Ratna moves ahead of that Bharat Chakravarti; as if the sun's disc is moving. Darkness cannot stand in front of the sun, so how can anyone stand in front of his brilliance in the three worlds? Therefore, O Bahubali! Bharat Maharaja is superior to all kings in strength, virility, and brilliance. Therefore, if you want the safety of your kingdom and life, you should take his shelter."

Bahubali, who defeated the strength of the world with his arms, raised his eyebrows and said in a deep voice like the roaring of the sea, "Messenger! You have spoken such words, which are greedy and disturbing. Messengers always deliver the words of their master as a true message. O Messenger! You have not said anything new that my father, who is revered by the gods, Asuras, and kings, is not worthy of worship and praise for me, but Bharat is also worthy of worship and praise for me. Kings who give, may stay away from them, but whose strong brother is Bahubali, he is close to his brother even while staying away from the field. We both have a deep affection for each other, like the sun and the lotus grove. My brother has a place in my heart. Then what is the purpose of going there? Our affection is natural from birth. It is true that we did not reach our brother naturally, but why should this be considered my cunning towards brother Bharat?"

## The Battle of Bharat and Bahubali

**Chapter 1 of Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verse 10**

A wise person, who acts thoughtfully, does not get swayed by the words of the wicked. Lord Rishabhdev Swami is the master of both of us. He is the only victor, so why do I need another master? He considers me his brother, so why should a brother fear his brother? The masters are those who command; they may command or not. What is special about the relationship of kinship? Does a diamond not cut another diamond? If Bharat Dev is served by demons and humans, and they have special affection for him, what concern is it of mine? A chariot that travels on the straight path does not suffer any harm, but a chariot that travels on the wrong path, even if it is the best chariot, will be shattered by hitting a rock or a tree. Indra is a devotee of his father; perhaps he will allow Bharat to sit on half his throne out of respect for his father. It is not right to become arrogant just because of this. You said that his army is like the ocean, and the armies of other kings are like salt in dough in comparison, but I am even more formidable, like a raging fire. Other lights merge into the brilliance of the sun, just as Bharat's infantry, chariots, horses, elephants, commanders, and Bharat himself will merge into my army. Therefore, O messenger! Go and tell your master that if he does not want to lose his kingdom and life in battle, then he should come to fight happily. I have no desire to take his kingdom. I am content with the kingdom given to me by my father.'

The messenger returned and told Bharat all that Bahubali had said. Therefore, Bharat, with a desire to fight Bahubali, marched with his army. Just as the sky is covered with clouds during the four months of Chaturmas, so too did the mighty Bahubali, with his army, cover the earth with dust as he marched towards Bharat. On the battlefield, the clash of weapons of the warriors, great warriors, and soldiers of both sides, who were eager for battle, sounded like the clash of waves in the ocean. The battle of the spearmen against the spearmen and the archers against the archers seemed as if Yama himself was present. 

Then, the mighty Bahubali, pushing his entire army aside like a ball of cotton, said to Bharat, 'Brother! Why are you accumulating unnecessary sin by causing the destruction of elephants, horses, chariots, and infantry? If you are capable of fighting alone, then come; let us both fight and settle this. Why are you needlessly throwing your army into destruction?'

Hearing this, both of them ordered their soldiers to leave the battlefield. Therefore, they stood on either side of the battlefield as spectators, as witnesses. The gods were also witnesses. Both brothers decided to fight each other in a duel. First, the battle of eyes began. Seeing both these human gods standing face to face, without blinking, even the gods were confused, thinking that these two must be gods with unwavering vision. Bharat was defeated in the battle of eyes. Therefore, the battle of words began, in which arguments were made by establishing the pros and cons. Bharat was defeated in this as well. Therefore, the two mighty warriors began the battle of arms. Bahubali stretched out his arm, and Bharat tried to bend it. But Bharat seemed like a monkey hanging on the branch of a large tree. Then it was Bahubali's turn, and the mighty Bahubali bent Bharat's arm like a vine with one hand. Then came the fistfight. Bharat struck the first blow on Bahubali, but like the waves of the ocean crashing against the coastal mountains, his fist only hit and remained there. It could not do anything to Bahubali. Then it was Bahubali's turn, and he struck Bharat with a blow like a thunderbolt, causing Bharat to faint and fall to the ground. Tears welled up in the eyes of the army. As soon as Bharat regained consciousness, he began to strike Bahubali with his club, like an elephant striking a mountain with its tusks. Bahubali also struck Bharat with his club, causing him to sink into the ground up to his knees, like a pit dug in the earth. Bharat began to doubt if this Bahubali was not a chakravarti. When he remembered the chakra, he remembered that...

## The Initiation of Bahubali and Praise by Bharat

**Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verse 10**

As soon as the chakra came into Bharat's hand, he roared in anger, emerged from the ground, and hurled the blazing chakra at Bahubali. The army cried out in alarm. But what was this? The chakra circled Bahubali and returned to Bharat. Because a weapon empowered by the gods cannot defeat a member of the same lineage. Seeing his brother acting unjustly, Bahubali's eyes turned red with anger. He thought, "Why not crush him along with the chakra?" With this thought, Bahubali clenched his fist and raised it to strike.

At that moment, a thought flashed through Bahubali's mind like lightning - "How much destruction will occur if I kill my elder brother under the influence of passions? It would be better to use this fist, which I have raised to strike my brother, to perform the Panchamoustik Loch and destroy the passions." Thus, contemplating, reflecting, and observing, Bahubali became detached from the world. He immediately performed the Loch with his raised fist, touching his hair. He became a forgiving Muni. Seeing this sudden transformation, the gods rejoiced, praising him, "You have done very well, you have done very beautifully!" They showered flowers on Bahubali and raised a joyous cry.

Becoming a Muni, Bahubali thought, "How can I, being a Muni, go to the Lord and bow to my younger brothers, who became Munis before me? It would be better to go directly to the Lord's Dharma Sabha and sit in the assembly of Kevalgnanis when I attain Kevalgyan. I will not have to bow to anyone or do anything else."

Thinking thus, Bahubali, content with his renunciation, stood there, assuming the Kayotsarga posture, silent and absorbed in meditation. Seeing Bahubali in this state, Bharat was filled with remorse for his wrong actions. He felt as if he was sinking into the earth with shame. He bowed to his brother, who was now a Muni, the embodiment of peace. Tears of remorse flowed from Bharat's eyes. It was as if his pent-up anger was being released in the form of tears. As Bharat bowed at Bahubali's feet, the reflection in the mirror-like nails of Bahubali's feet showed the various emotions of service, devotion, remorse, etc., that were arising in Bharat's mind. Bharat, like a medicine for the disease of his guilt, began to self-reproach and praise Bahubali Muni in front of him - "O Muni, you are blessed! You have renounced the kingdom like a straw, out of compassion for me. I am truly wicked, sinful, dissatisfied, and falsely arrogant; I have caused you pain. I am the leader of all those who do not recognize their own strength, who are inclined towards injustice, and who are under the influence of greed. The kingdom is truly the seed that nourishes the tree of the world. Those who do not understand this are unfortunate. Even knowing this, I could not give up the kingdom, therefore I am more wicked than the wicked. A true son is one who follows his father's path. I also aspire to become a true son of Lord Rishabhdev like you." Thus, washing away the mud of sorrow with the water of remorse, Bharat Maharaj placed his son, Somayasha, on the throne and performed his coronation. From that time until today, the Soma dynasty has continued, with hundreds of branches still existing today, which has given birth to many great men. Thus, Bharat, bowing to Bahubali Muni, returned to his Ayodhya city with his family, like the goddess of fortune.

A year passed as Bahubali Muni performed difficult austerities and destroyed the karmas accumulated from past lives. When the time was ripe for Bahubali's pride to be destroyed, Lord Rishabhdev, with his unconfused vision, instructed Brahmi and Sundari to go to Bahubali and inspire him to be free from pride. Therefore, following the Lord's command, the two great Sadhvis went to Bahubali Muni and said, "O Great Being! Equal-minded in gold and stone! Renouncer of association! 

1. The mention of the Chakra coming into the hands of the Dand Ratna Chakri is in the Sangatyagi Sanveg Rangshala.
2. In the Avasarpini time, injustice began from here.

## The Nirvana of Rishabha Prabhu

**Chapter 10 of Yoga Shastra, First Light**

"Brother Muni! Descend from the elephant's shoulder; it is not proper to remain mounted. How will you attain knowledge this way? If fire burns below the lindens, new leaves do not sprout on the tree. Brother Muni! If you wish to swim across the ocean of the world, then consider for yourself and descend from this elephant, like a boat made of iron."

Bahuvali Muni began to ponder, "On what elephant am I mounted? What connection do I have with an elephant? Vines climb trees, how can an elephant touch my body? The ocean may perhaps abandon its boundaries, mountains may become mobile, yet a Sadhvi, a disciple of the Lord, can never speak falsely. Oh yes! I have understood, I am mounted on this elephant of pride, and it has destroyed my tree of knowledge, the tree of humility bearing the fruit of knowledge, the fruit of Kevala Jnana. How can I pay homage to my younger brothers, who were initiated before me? This very thought has kept me mounted on the elephant of pride. Shame on such thoughts! Though they may be younger than me in age, they are older than me in knowledge, vision, and character. They were initiated before me. May this evil (sinful thought) of mine be false. I will go now and pay homage to those younger brothers and their disciples, becoming like an atom."

As Bahuvali Muni took a step to go to the Lord, he attained Kevala Jnana, like the door to the Nirvana Bhavan. He began to see the entire world as if in the palm of his hand, with the wealth of Kevala Jnana. He went to the Lord and sat among the assembly of Kevala Jnanas.

Meanwhile, Bharat Chakravarti, though possessing fourteen great jewels, sixty-four thousand women in his inner palace, and nine treasures, remained detached, using the wealth of his empire in accordance with Dharma, Artha, and Kama, at the appropriate time.

Once, while wandering, the Lord arrived at the Ashtapada mountain. Filled with the desire to pay homage at the Lord's feet, Bharat Chakravarti reached there. The Lord Rishabhadev, the world's master, worthy of worship by gods and demons, was seated in the Samavasaran. Bharat paid his respects with three circumambulations and began to praise him, saying,

"Lord! You are the very embodiment of faith. You are the capital of good conduct. You are the form of solitary grace for the entire world. You are the embodiment of direct knowledge. You are the very essence of merit. You are the totality of all beings with bodies, gathered in one place. You are the embodiment of restraint. You are the benefactor of the world without any reason. You are like the mobile nature. You are without a body, even though you have a body. You are forgiving. You are like the secret of Yoga. You are the concentrated essence of the world's vitality. You are the successful means of achieving Siddhi. You are all-auspicious. You are the form of all good. You are the embodied mediator. You are the combined form of penance, calmness, true knowledge, Yoga, and so on. You are the very form of humility. You are like extraordinary Siddhi. You are like a vast heart towards all the treasures of knowledge. You are the integral meaning of the mantras like Namah, Swasti, Swadha, Swaha, Vashad. You are the pure embodiment of Dharma. You are like the excess of creation. You are the concentrated form of all penance. You are the result of all. You are the entire group of eternal virtues. You are the form of excellence, the unimpeded means of attaining Moksha Lakshmi. You are the unique place of influence. You are the reflection of Moksha. You are like the ancestral home of the learned. You are the result of all blessings. You are like the best mirror to see the best character of the Aryans. You are the seer of the world. You are the calm, detached form. You are like the door to peace for the suffering. You are living, awake Brahmacharya. You are the unparalleled living being of the Jiva Loka, earned through brilliant merit. You are compassionate, with long arms, as if pulling the beings of the world from the mouth of the lion of death. You are the nectar, churned out from the ocean of knowledge, using the Meru mountain as the churning stick, from the churning of the churning stick. You are the cause of the immortality of beings. You are the giver of protection to the entire world. You are the assurance to the three worlds. Oh Lord of Love! I take refuge in you. Be pleased with me."

In this way, Bharat Maharaj, with a focused mind, worshipped the Lord Rishabhadev, the lord of the three worlds, for a long time.

After taking initiation, one lakh years minus one thousand years of the past time elapsed, the Lord attained Moksha on the Ashtapada mountain, along with ten thousand Sadhus. At that time, Indra and other gods celebrated the Lord's Nirvana Mahotsav. Indra Maharaj comforted and reassured the deeply grief-stricken Bharat. Later, on the Ashtapada mountain, Bharat Maharaj built a temple of gems, called Nishadya, like the second Ashtapada. In it, Bharat Chakravarti installed a statue made of precious stones, adorned with the form, color, and posture of Lord Rishabhadev. Along with Rishabhadev, the future 23 Tirthankaras...

## Description of Bharat and Marudeva Mata's Attainment of Kevalgyan

Bharat, after establishing the principles of Yoga Shastra in the first chapter of the first book, built magnificent stupas for ninety-nine of his brother monks. He then returned to his capital and dedicated himself to ruling his people. As a result of his past karma, Bharat enjoyed various pleasures like Indra, the king of the gods. 

One day, Bharat, adorned with clothes and jewels, went to his mirror chamber. He stood before the mirror, admiring his reflection, which was adorned with the jewels he wore. Suddenly, a ring fell from his finger, leaving his finger looking dull and lifeless. This made him ponder: if the removal of a single ring diminished the beauty of his finger, what would happen if he removed all his ornaments? 

He removed all his ornaments and looked at his reflection. He saw his body, devoid of ornaments, as lifeless as a tree without leaves. He delved deeper into contemplation: "Is the beauty of this body due to ornaments? Instead of adorning this body with jewels, why not adorn my soul with the jewels of knowledge and other virtues? Those ornaments are permanent, their shine will never fade. What is the benefit of adorning this body, filled with excrement and other impurities, with external sources? It is like plastering a hollow wall to enhance its beauty. Just as rain on barren land is useless, so too does this body, adorned with camphor, musk, and other substances, only pollute those beautiful substances. Therefore, to make this body meaningful, one must renounce the attachment to the means of happiness, which are ultimately painful, and embrace the practice of austerity and self-restraint, which leads to liberation. This is how one can achieve the highest fruit."

Thus, filled with the nectar of detachment, Bharat contemplated the impermanence of all things. Through this contemplation, he attained Kevalgyan. This is the extraordinary power of Yoga!

At that time, the devout Indra presented him with the monks, including Rajoharan, and then paid his respects. He then placed Bharat's son, Aditya Yasha, on the throne. From that day to this, the lineage of the kings has continued.

A question arises: "Bharat Chakravarti had attained the experience of Yoga in a previous life by taking monastic vows. With the strength of that yogic attainment, he did not have to exert much effort to destroy his negative karma and eliminate karmic afflictions. From this perspective, it is appropriate to use the example of Bharat Maharaja to explain the greatness of Yoga. But how can a being who has not attained the three jewels (faith, knowledge, and conduct) in previous lives, and has not destroyed his karma, and has not attained human birth in a previous life, destroy the accumulated karma of countless lifetimes?"

The answer is given in the following verse:

**Verse 11:**

> Even though she had not attained Dharma in any previous birth, Marudeva Mata, filled with supreme bliss, attained the supreme state through the power of Yoga.

**Explanation:**

Marudeva Mata had not attained true Dharma in any birth, nor had she experienced the three lower realms or human birth. Only in her present birth, through the power of Yoga, did she burn away the fuel of long-accumulated karma with the great fire of Shukla Dhyana. As it is said, "Jah Marudeva Accanta Thavara Siddha" (A. Ni. 1036), meaning, "Just as Marudeva alone, without going to any other realm and without wandering in the world, directly attained liberation from the eternal, unchanging (Anadi Nigoda) state." Marudeva's character has been briefly described earlier.

Marudeva Mata had not committed intense karma in her previous lives, so she attained liberation effortlessly with a little practice of Yoga.

Description of Dridhaprāhārī
The solution to the question of whether even an extremely cruel person can attain success through the influence of yoga is presented in the following verse.

12. Brahma-strī-bhruṇa-go-ghāta-pātakān-narakātiteḥ | Dṛḍhaprāhāri-prabhūter-yogaḥ hastāvalambanaṃ ||12||

Meaning: For the Dṛḍhaprāhārī (the extremely violent one), who had committed the great sins of killing a Brahmin, a woman, an embryo, and a cow, and thus became a guest of hell, yoga was the only support.

Explanation: Killing a Brahmin, a woman, an embryo, and a cow are considered the greatest sins in the world. Although for one who considers all souls equal, whether a Brahmin or a non-Brahmin, a woman or a man, an embryo or a youth, a cow or any other animal, the sin of killing any five-sensed being is almost the same. It is said that one should not commit violence against any being, be it a king or a water-fetching servant. The vow of non-violence (ahiṃsā-vrata) prohibits causing harm to any living being. However, in worldly practice, the killer of these four (Brahmin, woman, child, and cow) is considered a great sinner. Others do not consider the killing of other beings as much of a sin as the killing of these four. Therefore, the killing of these four is called a great sin (mahāpātaka) here.

As a result of this great sin, the Dṛḍhaprāhārī became eligible for hell. But due to the power of yoga attained by him, he became eligible for liberation in the same birth. Similarly, other great sinners who have understood the Jain scriptures and acquired the wealth of yoga have purified their hell-bound karmas and attained the supreme state of liberation.

Transformation of Dṛḍhaprāhārī's heart:
In a certain city, there lived an extremely unruly Brahmin. He was so sinful that whenever he was seen, he would astonish the innocent people and inflict oppression on them. The state protectors expelled him from the city. Thus, he ended up in the thieves' village, like a hawk falling into the hands of hunters. The captain of the thieves, impressed by his merciless behavior and violent conduct, and considering him suitable for his work, accepted him as his son. One day, the captain of the thieves was suddenly killed in a clash. Therefore, this cruel youth was accepted as the new captain, considering him as the son and a valiant person. He did not hesitate or delay even a bit in committing the murder of living beings mercilessly. Due to this, he became famous among the people as Dṛḍhaprāhārī (the extremely violent one).

One day, taking some brave warriors with him, he went to loot the village of Kuśasthala. In that village, there lived a very poor Brahmin named Devaśarmā. His children, like hoping for fruits from a fruitless tree, expressed their desire to eat khīra (a sweet dish) in front of their father. The Brahmin went around the entire village, begging for rice from one place, milk from another, and jaggery from somewhere else. After collecting the ingredients for khīra, he went to the river to bathe. Meanwhile, those very thieves barged into his house. Thinking that the weak are destroyed by fate, one of the thieves, like a hungry ghost, quickly grabbed the pot of khīra and fled. Seeing their khīra stolen, the Brahmin's sons cried and complained to their father about it.

Burning with anger, the Brahmin immediately grabbed a pestle and, like a messenger of Yama (the god of death), rushed towards the thieves. Summoning all his courage and strength, he started beating the thieves mercilessly with the pestle. Seeing his fellow thieves being beaten, the Dṛḍhaprāhārī rushed to confront him. As he was running, by divine arrangement, a cow came in his way, as if to obstruct his path of misfortune. The leader of these wicked thieves...

Drdhaprahari Muni's endurance of adversity with equanimity

Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verse 12 (Mukhiya) - He saw and did not hesitate, like a butcher, he killed the poor cow with a single stroke of his sword. The impoverished Brahmin, who had come to confront the thief, was also beheaded with a single blow of the sword, falling to the ground like a pineapple tree. At that time, his pregnant wife came before him and cried out, "Oh, merciless sinner, what have you done?" But he did not listen to her, and like a wolf suddenly attacking a pregnant goat, the cruel man attacked the pregnant woman and cut her in two with his sword. The child in her womb was also torn to pieces. It was an extremely tragic sight, seeing the child trembling like bel leaves, writhing and convulsing, even a heart of stone would have sprouted seeds of compassion. At that very moment, the Brahmin's son came there, wailing loudly, "Alas, father, alas, father!" Seeing the hungry, naked, thin, and black-haired children with dirt on their bodies, Drdhaprahari began to repent and think, "Alas! I have become merciless and killed this Brahmin couple! What will happen to these poor unfortunate children? Just as fish cannot survive without water in a reservoir, how can these children survive without their parents? Oh! This cruel act, I don't know what misfortune it will lead me to? Who will save me from the fruits of this sin? Whose refuge should I seek now?" Thinking in this way, a sense of detachment arose. Therefore, instead of going to the village, he reached a garden outside the village. There he saw a sage-Muni, like a medicine for the disease of sin. The murderer Drdhaprahari greeted him and said, "Lord! I am a great sinner. Not only that, even the one who talks to me becomes a sinner. Because the person who touches a person covered in mud also gets mud on him. It is a common belief that whoever kills even one of a child, woman, Brahmin, or cow, is surely destined for hell. I, being merciless, have killed all four. Lord! Only a holy sage like you can protect a merciless and sinful person like me." When it rains, it does not consider whether it is fertile land or barren land?" That purifier of the fallen, the Muni, instructed him in the path of virtuous conduct, full of austerity and self-control, to completely free him from sin. Just as a man who is afraid of the heat puts on an umbrella, so too, with great curiosity, he accepted the virtuous path to escape the fear of the suffering of sin. He also took this vow: "As long as I remember this sin, I will not eat and I will seek complete forgiveness." The great-minded Drdhaprahari Muni, desiring the destruction of karma, while wandering, reached near the same village where he had previously spread terror. When the villagers saw him, they recognized him and said, "This is the same head of sinners, the great sinner, the cunning one has now deceitfully donned the garb of a sage. Drive him away." Many people said, "This is the same murderer of the cow, the Brahmin, the child, and the woman. A hypocrite! Let him come, we will make him taste the consequences!" Thus, for many days, people cursed, scolded, rebuked, and condemned the Mahatma in various ways. Wherever he went for alms, people would hit him with stones, just as dogs are hit with stones. In this way, Drdhaprahari Muni, when he went to the village every day for alms, etc., would hear these slanderous words, and because of this, he would remember his sins and, according to his vow, would not respond to anyone, but would remain in a state of forgiveness; he would also not eat. Truly, for a courageous soul, nothing is difficult. Sometimes in the morning, sometimes in the afternoon, and sometimes in the evening, whenever he met the villagers, they would remind him of his past sins. Therefore, he did not eat even for a single day. People would beat him with stones, sticks, fists, etc., throw dust on him; yet he endured all these disturbances with equanimity and thought, "Self! Just as you have committed sins, so too, you must experience the fruits of sin! As you sow, so shall you reap. It is very good that these people, by being angry with me, are unknowingly giving me the opportunity to attain the perfection of being free from desire. If their hearts are filled with joy by being angry with me, let them be; I endure their harsh words with love. Therefore,

## Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verse 13

**Chilatiputra**

"My karmas are being cut. This is a cause of joy for me. These people are happy by troubling me; let them be happy today, because attaining happiness in the world is rare. Just as a physician cures diseases with alkali, so these people, by speaking harsh words, are trying to destroy my evil deeds. Therefore, they are my true well-wishers. Just as the heat of fire removes the dirt on gold, making it bright and shining, so these people, by beating me or by anger, etc., are making my soul free from karma and bright. By attacking me, they are pulling me out of the prison of hell; should I be angry with such benefactors? They are removing my sins by giving their own punya. Who else can be greater than such selfless brothers? Such killing or pain, etc., which is the cause of liberation from the world, is a source of joy for me. But I am saddened that the torture given to me will be the cause of the growth of the infinite world. In this world, many people sacrifice even their wealth and body for the happiness of others, so in front of them, anger or killing, etc., which gives them happiness, is nothing. Some people have only scorned me, they have not beaten me. Many have beaten me, but they have not deprived me of life. Some people were about to free me from life, but they did not separate me from my supreme friend, Dharma. Therefore, may they be well; may they get good sense. Those who are angry with the seeker of liberation, who speak harsh words, who bind with ropes, who trouble with weapons, or who bring death, should be tolerated with equanimity and with a feeling of friendship; because there are many obstacles in the path of liberation." Thus, the Muni, immersed in beautiful emotions, began to condemn his evil deeds. Just as fire burns all the grass flowers, so the steadfast Muni burned all his karma with the fire of repentance and, attaining the extremely rare, pure, Kevala Jnana, reached the state of Aayogikevali and also attained liberation.

Just as the steadfast Muni, giving up being a guest of Naraka, attained the supreme state of infinite, eternal happiness (Moksha) through the power of Yoga, so others should also strive in this Yoga with certainty. || 12 || Now we will increase faith in Yoga by giving another example. || 13 ||

**Tatkalakritadushkarma**

**Meaning**

"Who will not desire Yoga, to protect Chilatiputra, the evil-minded, who was very bold in committing evil deeds just a short time ago?" || 13 ||

**Explanation:** - Who will not desire such a Yoga-sadhana, who saved Chilatiputra, the evil-minded, who was a brave warrior in committing the great sin of killing a woman, from hell? Below we are giving the story of Chilatiputra.

**The Story of Chilatiputra:**

In a city established on earth, there lived a Brahmin named Yajnadeva. He considered himself a scholar, but always condemned Jainism. A disciple (Muni) could not tolerate this. Even after his Guru stopped him, he challenged the Brahmin to a debate, with the intention of defeating him. They agreed on a condition that whoever lost the debate would become the disciple of the winner. The intelligent Jain Muni defeated his opponent Brahmin in the debate. Yajnadeva had to accept his defeat, and as per the agreement, the victorious Jain Muni gave Yajnadeva-Brahmin Jain initiation. After taking initiation, Shasana Devi explained to Yajnadeva that now you have attained Charitra (five great vows), therefore you have become knowledgeable and faithful. Now do not violate Charitra. Yajnadeva Muni truly followed Charitra; but due to past impressions, he hated the dirt that accumulated on his clothes and body. It is true, "It is very difficult to give up past impressions." By the association of this great Muni, even his relatives became like the rays of the sun, in contact with the clouds of the rainy season.

The Miracle of Yoga in the Life of Chilatiputra

Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verse 13: He did not remain calm. The one with whom he was married was also very attached to him. Just as the color of a saree dyed blue does not fade, so too did her love for Yajnadeva not fade. With the intention of subduing Yajnadeva Muni, she put some kind of mesmerizing powder in the food for breaking the fast, under the influence of which Yajnadeva Manika's body became increasingly emaciated like the moon in the dark fortnight. Just as the moon, upon setting, enters the solar system, so too, one day, upon death, that Muni went from there to heaven. It is true that a woman, whether lustful, attached, or detached, does not leave anyone without killing them. Upon the death of her husband (Muni), his wife, renouncing the world, embraced restraint (Sadhvi Diksha) as a result of the fruit of the human chest. Without criticizing the sin of the mesmerizing experiment she had performed on her husband, she died and was born in the heavenly realm. Truly, "tapasya and restraint do not go in vain." On the other hand, Yajnadeva's soul, having fallen from the heavenly realm, was born in the form of a letter from the womb of a maid named Chilati in the house of a wealthy merchant in Rajgriha. Being the son of Chilati Dasi, he came to be known among people as Chilatiputra. Therefore, he was not given another name. What is a birth celebration for the son of a maid! Yajnadeva's wife, having fallen from heaven, was born as a daughter named Sushama, after five sons, from the womb of Bhadhra, the wife of the wealthy merchant. The Seth appointed Chilatiputra to take care of that daughter. As Chilatiputra grew older, he became very arrogant. He began to torment people. His complaints reached the king. The Seth was afraid of the king. Because he saw the danger that "the master is punished for the crime of the servant." Therefore, the Seth wisely and quietly removed that constantly troublesome maid's son (Chilatiputra) from the house, just as a snake charmer removes a snake from a pit by beating it. This aroused a terrible reaction in Chilatiputra's mind. He was already arrogant. To justify his arrogance, he reached the den of thieves called Singhagupha, like a vine of great crimes. It is said, "People with similar habits and nature quickly become friends." According to this justice, he quickly became friends with the thieves there. As a result, just as fire increases with the contact of wind, so too did his crimes increase with the company of those thieves. After a few days, the lord of Singhagupha, the thief commander, died. As if he had been prepared for this, Chilatiputra was made the commander of the thieves to fill the vacant position.

Meanwhile, adorned with beauty, grace, and other qualities, Sushama had reached the lion's gate of youth. When she was adorned, she looked like the goddess of the earth. She had also become proficient in many arts. The new thief commander, Chilatiputra, said to his servants, "Let's all go to Rajgriha. There, the wealthy merchant is a very wealthy man. Let's raid his house and loot as much wealth as we can, and you all can share it. And I will take his daughter named Sushama." Thus, agreeing among themselves, Chilatiputra reached the house of the wealthy merchant that very night with his fellow thieves. He used the art of sleep-inducing magic there and put everyone in the house to sleep. Announcing his arrival, he had the thieves take a large amount of wealth and he himself captured Sushama. When the wealthy merchant's entire family, including his five sons, was asleep, he said, "This is just for him," and, taking Sushama with all his might, he set off. His fellow thieves, taking the stolen wealth, disappeared with Chilatiputra. When the wealthy merchant woke up, he quickly understood the whole situation. He was very distressed that Chilatiputra, who was the son of the maid who lived in his house, had run away with both my daughter and my property. He immediately called the Kotwal and other city guards and said, "Find out where the thieves have taken the wealth and Sushama and bring them back!" Then, taking the Kotwal and some guards with him, the wealthy merchant himself, armed with weapons, along with his sons, ran swiftly like a gust of wind to chase the thieves. Just as a person who drinks datura becomes intoxicated and sees yellow everywhere, in water, on land, in vines, trees, or on the path, so too did the wealthy merchant, in his anger, see yellow everywhere.

## The Parable of Chilatiputra

**Chapter 1 of Yoga Shastra**

**Verse 13**

The wealthy merchant, like gold that appears to be real, saw only prosperity everywhere. Driven by this delusion, he ran wildly. Wherever he found footprints or any sign, he would exclaim, "Look! They drank water here; they ate here; they sat here; they passed this way." Thus, talking and taking long strides, he followed the trail of the thieves, tracking their footprints until he reached them. Upon seeing the thieves, the royal guards shouted, "Catch them! Kill them! Don't let them escape!" Hearing this, the thieves, fearing arrest, abandoned their loot and fled in different directions to save their lives. But just as a lion does not let go of a captured deer, Chilatiputra did not let go of the prosperity. The Kotwal and other royal officials, upon receiving a large sum of money as a bribe, returned. It is true, "When self-interest is fulfilled, everyone's mind becomes corrupted." Just as an elephant lifts a creeper, Chilatiputra lifted the prosperity onto his shoulder and fled into a terrifying jungle. For the wealthy merchant, rescuing his daughter from the hands of the thief was as difficult as rescuing the moon from the mouth of Rahu. Yet, the wealthy merchant, with courage, pursued Chilatiputra like a lion, along with his five sons. Meanwhile, Chilatiputra, with cunning, severed the head of Sushama, fearing that the wealthy merchant would take her into his possession if he reached him. Now, with a naked sword in one hand and the severed head of Sushama in the other, he ran wildly. At that time, he looked like the guardian of Yama's realm. The wealthy merchant, upon reaching the separated torso of Sushama, began to weep. It was as if he was offering Sushama an offering of tears. Afterward, he thought, "It is useless to stay here now. My daughter Sushama is gone. The wealth is also gone." Therefore, leaving the severed torso of Sushama there, he returned with his sons, his steps heavy with grief. The wealthy merchant, pierced by the thorns of sorrow, wandered through the terrifying jungle. The sun of the summer afternoon was scorching. Its blazing, harsh rays were burning their foreheads. There was no sign of shade anywhere. The wealthy merchant and his five sons, afflicted by grief, fatigue, hunger, thirst, and the heat of midday, looked as if they were undergoing the five fires. In that dense forest, they found no water, edible fruit, or any life-giving medicine on their way; instead, they saw ferocious wild animals that devoured flesh, as if they had come to invite death. Seeing the plight of himself and his sons, the wealthy merchant, while walking a long distance, thought, "Alas! All my wealth is lost; my daughter, dearer than life, is also dead, and now we are also on the brink of death. Oh! Curse this cruel play of fate! Where a man cannot achieve his desired object through effort or intellectual brilliance, there, in the wilderness, fate is the only refuge. It is very powerful. But this fate is not pleased by charity, it cannot be subdued by humility, it cannot be controlled by service. How difficult is this fate-subduing practice? Even scholars cannot understand its essence. Even the valiant cannot stop its complex processes. Who else will be equal to this fate? And it is also true that this fate sometimes bestows grace like a friend, and sometimes destroys mercilessly like an enemy. Sometimes it protects completely like a father, and sometimes it inflicts pain like the wicked. Sometimes fate brings one who is on the wrong path to the right path, and sometimes it inspires one to go from the right path to the wrong path. Sometimes it brings a distant object close, and sometimes it snatches away even an object that is in hand. Like illusion and magic, the movement of fate is very deep and strange. By the favor of fate, poison becomes nectar, and by its disfavor, nectar becomes poison." Thus, the grief-stricken wealthy merchant, caught in the cycle of worry, somehow reached his capital city with his sons. He performed the last rites for the body of his daughter Sushama. Later, becoming detached from the world, he accepted initiation from Lord Mahavira and, after performing arduous austerities, attained his full lifespan and went to heaven.

**Note:** The text mentions the consumption of the daughter's flesh to satisfy hunger in the necessary explanation.

## Praise of Yoga

**Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verse 14**

Chilatiputra, driven by intense love for his beloved, was heading south, ignoring the path. On his way, he saw a sage, steady in Kayotsarga (meditation), like a shady tree that removes all suffering. Chilatiputra's mind was constantly tormented by his actions. Seeing the sage's peaceful countenance, he was deeply impressed. As the sage finished his meditation, Chilatiputra said, "Tell me the Dharma briefly, or I will cut off your head with this sword, just like you cut off the banana tree for its fruit." The sage, with his knowledge, knew that the seed of enlightenment could be sown in this soul. He said, "One should diligently practice Upshama, Vivek, and Sanvar." Saying this, he flew away like a bird. Hearing these three words, Chilatiputra grasped them well and began to remember them repeatedly. Gradually, he understood their meaning: "Wise men should subdue the passions like anger. Alas, I am surrounded by these passions like a sandalwood tree surrounded by snakes. To cure this great disease of passions, I must stay away from them. My first resolution for subduing passions is to consume the medicines of forgiveness, humility, simplicity, and contentment. My second resolution is to accept the Vivek of renunciation of wealth, gold, and other material possessions, which is the unparalleled seed of the great tree of knowledge. I also renounce this Sushma, like a flag of sinful wealth, and the sword in my hand, and all the meaning that is harmful. My third resolution is to embrace the renunciation of the objects of the senses and mind, and the Sanvar, like the crown of the goddess of self-control." Thus, controlling all his senses and contemplating the true nature of things, he became so absorbed that his mind became one-pointed. He became still and motionless in samadhi.

Meanwhile, thousands of ants were attracted by the smell of blood clinging to Chilatiputra's body. They covered his body like armor and made hundreds of holes in it. Even with this unbearable torment, Chilatiputra remained motionless like a pillar. He endured this intense suffering with equanimity for two and a half days and then left his body. From there, he went to the heaven world.

Other sources also narrate the story of Chilatiputra. They say that I bow to Chilatiputra, the devotee of Upshama, Vivek, and Sanvar, who, after hearing these three words, understood Dharma well and embraced self-control. I bow to the ascetic who remained in samadhi even when ants, attracted by the smell of blood, climbed his body from his feet to his head and gnawed at his entire body. I bow to the steadfast Chilatiputra, whose body was made like a sieve by the ants, who remained steadfast on the path of equanimity. In just two and a half days, through the power of yoga, he attained the divine state, adorned by apsaras.

Indeed, Chilatiputra, with his Chandala-like behavior, was deserving of condemnation and hell, but by embracing yoga, he became worthy of the happiness of heaven. Similarly, yoga is the root cause of all happiness, through which a person achieves victory everywhere. ||13||

Again, in praise of yoga, it is said: ||14||

**Tasyajanniravastu, nripashormoghajanmanah | Aviddhakarnho yo 'yoga', ityaksara-shalakaya ||14||**

**Meaning:** The birth of a man whose ears are not pierced by the two and a half-letter-long needle of "yoga" is like that of an animal. Such a person should not have been born at all. ||14||

Even if the ears are pierced with an iron needle, but not with the two and a half-letter-long needle of "yoga," or if "yoga" has not entered his ears, he is not worthy of being called a human among humans. His birth is futile and ironic, like that of an animal. It would have been better if he had not been born at all. ||14||

The root cause of liberation (moksha) is yoga, which is the essence of knowledge and the essence of the soul.

The first chapter of the Yoga Shakha, verses 15 and 16, begin by praising yoga and then explain its nature.

**Verse 15:**

* **Meaning:** Among the four goals of human life (dharma, artha, kama, and moksha), liberation (moksha) is the most important. The cause of attaining liberation is yoga. Yoga is comprised of three jewels: knowledge, faith, and conduct.

**Explanation:**

* Among the four goals of life, liberation is the most important. 
* Artha (wealth) is not the primary goal because it is tainted by suffering, as we experience pain when we acquire, protect, or lose it.
* Kama (desire) is merely sensual pleasure, which is fleeting and insignificant. It is better than artha, but ultimately leads to great suffering. Desire does not satisfy, and often leads to bad karma, making it not the primary goal.
* Dharma (righteousness) is superior to both artha and kama because it leads to happiness in this life and the next. However, even good deeds, like chains of gold, can bind the soul. They bring happiness, but not spiritual happiness. Physical happiness is temporary and fleeting. Therefore, dharma is not the ultimate goal.
* True spiritual happiness is found in liberation. Liberation occurs when karma is destroyed, and it is free from suffering. It is not like poisoned food, which is pleasant at first but leads to pain. It is also not tainted by the desire for results in this life or the next. Therefore, liberation, which is filled with eternal bliss, is the most important of the four goals.
* Yoga is the means to attain liberation. Yoga leads to liberation.

**Verse 16:**

* **Meaning:** Wise people call it right knowledge (samyak jnana) when one understands the nature of the principles (tattvas) as they truly are (yathā), either briefly or in detail.

**Explanation:**

* The principles (tattvas) are those whose nature is established through logic, evidence, and proof. These principles are the soul (jiva), non-soul (ajiva), inflow (āśrava), restraint (samvara), stoppage (nirjarā), bondage (bandha), and liberation (moksha).
* The true understanding (knowledge) of these principles comes to some people briefly and to others in detail, depending on their karmic exhaustion.
* The seven principles are: soul, non-soul, inflow, restraint, stoppage, bondage, and liberation.

**The Soul (Jiva):**

* There are two types of souls: liberated and bound.
* All souls are inherently infinite knowledge, vision, and bliss.
* Liberated souls are free from all karma and are eternally free from birth, death, and suffering. They are filled with infinite vision, knowledge, and bliss.
* Bound souls are divided into two categories: mobile (tras) and immobile (sthāvara).
* Both mobile and immobile souls are further divided into two categories: sufficient and insufficient.
* Sufficient souls are of six types: 1. food sufficiency, 2. body sufficiency, 3. sense organ sufficiency, 4. breath sufficiency, 5. speech sufficiency, and 6. mind sufficiency.
* One-sense immobile souls have four types, two-sense, three-sense, and four-sense (impaired) immobile souls have five types, and five-sense immobile souls have six types.
* One-sense immobile souls have five types: earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, air-bodied, and plant-bodied. The first four have subtle and gross forms, while plants have only one form.

**Footnotes:**

* 1. Dharma here refers to "merit" and not to the purification of the soul or restraint and stoppage.
* 2. Most teachers include "merit" and "demerit" as two additional principles, making a total of nine. Here, these two principles are included in the principle of inflow.

## Fourteen Gunasthana

There are two divisions of each and ordinary: each is a *badar* and the ordinary has two divisions: subtle and *badar*. Those with two, three, four, and five senses are called *Trasajiva*; they are of four types. Among the five-sensed beings, there are two divisions: 1. *Sanjni* and 2. *Asanjni*. Those who understand or know education, teachings, conversation, etc. are called *Sanjni*, and those who do not have mind or breath are called *Asanjni* five-sensed. Touch, tongue, nose, eye, and ear; these are the five senses. Touch, taste, flavor, smell, form, and sound are their respective five objects. There are many types of two-sensed beings like worms, conch shells, cowries, scallops, leeches, etc. Ants, bedbugs, *j*, *mankoda*, etc. are three-sensed beings. Locusts, moths, flies, mosquitoes, bees, scorpions, etc. are four-sensed beings. The rest of the *tiryach-yoni*, including aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial, hellish, human, and divine, are all five-sensed beings.

Mind, speech, and body-form are three forces, five senses, lifespan, and inhalation-exhalation are called ten *pranas*. One-sensed beings have four *pranas*: body, lifespan, inhalation-exhalation, and sense. Two-sensed have six, three-sensed have seven, four-sensed have eight, *Asanjni* five-sensed have nine, and *Sanjni* five-sensed have ten *pranas*. Among the five-sensed, gods and hellish beings are born from *upapat* birth, while humans and *tiryach* are mostly born from the womb, and among *tiryach*, there are viviparous, ovoviviparous, and oviparous (born from eggs). All these are *Sanjni* five-sensed, and the rest, born from *samurchhim*, are called *Asanjni* five-sensed. *Samurchhim* beings and sinful beings of hell are eunuchs. There are three *vedas*: female *veda*, male *veda*, and eunuch *veda*. Among gods, there are two *vedas*: female *veda* and male *veda*. Humans and *tiryach* have three *vedas*. All beings have two divisions: *vyavahar-rashi* and *avyavahar-rashi*. Subtle *nigod* beings are considered to be in *avyavahar-rashi*, and the rest of all beings are called *vyavahar-rashi*. Conscious, unconscious, mixed, closed, open, and mixed, cold, hot, and lukewarm, thus there are nine types of *yoni* of beings. That is, places of origin. Earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, and air-bodied, each of the seven beings has seven hundred thousand *yoni*. Each plant-bodied has one million, and ordinary plant-bodied, infinite-bodied, has fourteen hundred thousand, two, three, and four-sensed, each has two hundred thousand, hellish, *tiryach*, and divine, each has four hundred thousand, and human has fourteen hundred thousand *yoni*. In total, eighty-four million *jiva-yoni* have been mentioned by the omniscient ones. One-sensed beings are 1. subtle and 2. *badar*, five-sensed - 3. *Sanjni* and 4. *Asanjni*, 5. two, 6. three, and 7. four-sensed beings, these seven are sufficient and insufficient. Thus, Jinendradev has described fourteen places of beings.

On these fourteen places (brief divisions) of beings, the omniscient ones have also described fourteen *marganadwaras*. The fourteen *marganas* are as follows: 1. motion, 2. sense, 3. body, 4. yoga, 5. *veda*, 6. knowledge, 7. *kṣayā*, 8. restraint, 9. diet, 10. vision, 11. *leśyā*, 12. *bhavyatva*, 13. *samyaktva*, and 14. *sanjni*. Now, these are called fourteen *gunasthana* of beings. Fourteen *gunasthana* of beings:

1. *Mithyatva*, 2. *Sasvadan*, 3. *Samyaktva-Mithyatva* (mixed), 4. *Avirati Samyagdristi*, 5. *Deshaviriti* (Shravak), 6. *Pramattasanyata*, 7. *Aparamattasanyata*, 8. *Nivrittibadar*, 9. *Anivrittibadar*, 10. *Sukshmasampray*, 11. *Upashantamooh*, 12. *Kshinamooh*, 13. *Sayogi Kevali*, and 14. *Ayogi Kevali*; these are the fourteen *gunasthana*.

(1) Until the rise of *mithyadarshan*, it is called *mithyadristi* *gunasthana*, (2) When *mithyatva* does not arise, but the quartet of infinite-connected *kṣayā* (anger, pride, deceit, and greed) arises, then the *gunasthana* that stays up to the excellent six *avalika* is called *sasvadan-gunasthana*. (3) The combination of both *samyaktva* and *mithyatva* is called the third (mixed) *gunasthana*; which lasts for a moment. (4) When the quartet of *apratyakhyanavaran* arises, there is *avirati samyagdristi*. (5) When the *kṣayā* of *pratyakhyanavaran* arises, there is *deshaviriti* (Shravak) *gunasthana*. (6) After attaining restraint, if one indulges in carelessness, then his *gunasthana* is called *pramattasanyata*. (7) The restrained one who does not indulge in carelessness, his *gunasthana* is called *apramattasanyata*. The sixth and seventh, both these *gunasthana* are for a moment, respectively.

## Description of Ajiva and Ashrava Tattva

**Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verse 16**

(8) The eighth Gunasthanaka, called A-poorvakarana, is where the karma of A-poorva-sthiiti is destroyed. From this Gunasthanaka, two categories begin: Upshama श्रेणी and Kshapaka श्रेणी.

(9) The Gunasthanaka of a Sadhaka who internally pacifies (Upshant) the results of gross Kashaya that have arisen is called Nivritti-badar.

(10) The ninth Gunasthanaka, called Anivritti-badar, is where there is no internal pacification (Upshama) of the results through effort. Both categories remain in this Gunasthanaka.

(11) The tenth Gunasthanaka, called Sukshma-Samparaya-Gunasthanaka, is where the Kashaya of Lobha exists in a subtle form. Both categories are present here.

(12) The eleventh Gunasthanaka, called Upshant-Moha, is where Moha is in a pacified state, but not completely destroyed.

(13) The twelfth Gunasthanaka, called Ksheen-Moha, is where Moha is completely destroyed (nirmool).

(14) The thirteenth Gunasthanaka, called Sayogi-Kevali, is where the four Ghatis (Ghatis that destroy Atma-gunas: Jnana-avareeniya, Darshan-avareeniya, Mohaniya, and Antaray) are destroyed.

(15) The fourteenth Gunasthanaka, called A-yogi-Kevali, is where the yoga of Man, Vachan, and Kaya is destroyed, and where the remaining Vedaniya, Nama, Gotra, and Aayushya karmas, which are called Aghati, are also destroyed. This is how the nature of the Jiva-tattva is understood in brief.

**Ajiva-Tattva:**

Dharma-astikaya, Adharma-astikaya, Akasha-astikaya, Pudgala-astikaya, and Kala are called Ajiva. The Sarvagnas have combined these five with Jiva to form the concept of Shad-dravya. Except for Kala, all the other substances gather in the form of Pradesh; therefore, they are Dravya-swaroop, and except for Jiva, the rest of the Dravyas are considered to be devoid of consciousness and inactive. Kala is devoid of Astikaya. Except for Pudgala-astikaya, the rest of the Dravyas are considered to be intangible or formless. All these Dravyas are born, destroyed, and remain stable. The characteristic of Pudgala is that it has touch, taste, smell, and color. There are two types of Pudgala: Anuroop and Skandh-roop. Anuroop is very subtle, and a group of infinite Anuroop is called Skandh. Skandh is called Pudgala-Skandh when it has form like smell, sound, subtlety, grossness, etc., and when it gives darkness, heat, light, division, shadow, Karma-vargana, Audarik-adi body, mind, language-vargana, breathing, pleasure-pain, and helps in life and death. Dharma-astikaya, Adharma-astikaya, and Akasha-astikaya are all three separate Dravyas. These three Dravyas are always intangible, inactive, and stable. There are countless Pradesh of one Jiva-dravya. There are as many Pradesh of Dharma-astikaya and Adharma-astikaya as there are Pradesh of Lokakasha. There are neither more nor fewer Pradesh in these two. Just as water helps aquatic creatures to move in water, similarly, Dharma-astikaya helps Jiva or Ajiva to move around. Just as shade helps a traveler to be stable, similarly, Adharma-astikaya helps Jiva and Pudgala to become stable. Akasha-astikaya is that which gives space (place) to Jivas and Pudgalas, remaining stable in its own place. It is infinite-Pradesh-swaroop, and it pervades both Lok and Alok.

Kala is a Dravya different from the Dravyas that reside in the Pradesh of Lokakasha; it is that which is capable of changing substances. For example, making the new old, making a young man old; all this is the work of Kala. In astrology, time, pal, vipal, ghadi, muhurta, prahar, day, night, month, year, yuga, etc., which are words that indicate time, are all considered to be the result of Kala. Those who know the essence of Kala have called it Vyavharik Kala. Substances that are called new, old, etc., keep changing in the world; all this is the power of Kala. Due to Kala, the present substance gets the name of the past, and the future substance gets the name of the present. In this way, Ajiva-tattva is complete.

**Ashrava-Tattva:**

The entry of Karma-roop water into the Jiva-roop reservoir through the yoga of Man, Vachan, and Kaya is called Ashrava. Shubh-karma

## Description of the Principles of Restraint and Liberation, the Nature of the Five Kinds of Knowledge

**Chapter 16 of the First Light of Yoga Shastra**

Good inflow, or merit, is caused by auspicious actions, while inauspicious inflow, or sin, is caused by inauspicious actions. Thus, the inflow of karma-water into the pond of the soul is called *āśrava*.

**Restraint (Samvara) and Cessation (Nirjara):**

Preventing inflows is called *samvara*. Partially separating the karmas, which are the cause of birth and death in the world, from the soul is called *nirjara*. Thus, the nature of both these principles has been explained together. The nature of *āśrava*, *samvara*, and *nirjara* is not being explained in detail here, as it will be discussed extensively in the section on contemplation. The reader can learn about it in detail there. Here, these three principles have been briefly explained to avoid repetition.

**Bondage (Bandha):**

Due to passions, the soul acquires karmic particles that are capable of binding. The principle that causes the soul to become dependent in this way is called *bandha*. Just as a prisoner bound by chains becomes dependent, similarly, the independent soul, bound by the chains of karma, also becomes dependent. There are four types of *bandha*: *prākṛtibandha*, *sthitibandha*, *anubhāgabandha*, and *pradeśabandah*. *Prākṛti* means the nature of karma. There are eight types of *prākṛtibandha*: 1. *jñānāvaraṇīya*, 2. *darśanāvaraṇīya*, 3. *vedanīya*, 4. *mohanīya*, 5. *āyuṣya*, 6. *nāma*, 7. *gotra*, and 8. *antarāya*. These are the eight fundamental natures of karma. The state of having more or less karma, i.e., the duration or time-rule of experiencing karma, is called *karma-sthiti* (*sthitibandha*). *Anubhāgabandha* refers to the taste of the result, and *pradeśabandah* refers to the groups of karmas.

The soul becomes bound by karma due to these five causes: *mithyātva*, *avīrati*, *pramāda*, *kaṣāya*, and *yoga*. Thus, the nature of *bandha* has been explained briefly.

**Liberation (Mokṣa):**

The complete destruction of all karmas, or the complete absence of the causes of karmic bondage, is called *mokṣa*. Before liberation, the destruction of the four *ghātikarmas* leads to *kevalajñāna*. After that, the destruction of the remaining causes leads to the liberation of the soul. The happiness of the gods, demons, and emperors in the three realms is not even a fraction of the infinite happiness of liberation. The happiness that is found in the stability of one's own soul, or in the delight of one's own nature, is transcendental, eternal, and never-ending. Because of this infinite happiness, liberation is considered to be the ultimate goal of all beings. Thus, the nature of *mokṣa* has been explained.

**The Nature of the Five Kinds of Knowledge:**

There are five main types of *samyagjñāna*: *matijñāna*, *śruta-jñāna*, *avadhi-jñāna*, *manaḥparyava-jñāna*, and *kevalajñāna*. These five kinds of knowledge are progressively superior. Each of these five types has further subdivisions.

* **Matijñāna:** Knowledge that arises from the senses and mind, with subdivisions like *avagraha*, *īhā*, *avāya*, *dhāraṇā*, *bahu*, *bahuvidha*, etc.
* **Śruta-jñāna:** Knowledge that is based on the scriptures, including the *angas*, *upangas*, and *prakirṇas*, and is characterized by detailed explanation and the use of *syādvāda*. There are many subdivisions of *śruta-jñāna*.
* **Avadhi-jñāna:** Knowledge of substances, in the form of a specific duration, that arises from the soul without the help of the senses or mind. There are two types of *avadhi-jñāna*: 1. *bhavapratyayika* and 2. *guṇa-pratyayika* (caused by the cessation of karmas). Gods and hell-beings have *avadhi-jñāna* from birth, but animals acquire it through the cessation of karmas. There are six types of *avadhi-jñāna*: *anugāmi*, *ananugāmi*, *vardhamāna*, *hīyamāna*, *pratipāti*, and *apratipāti*.
* **Manaḥparyava-jñāna:** There are two types of *manaḥparyava-jñāna*: *ṛjumati* and *vipulamati*. *Ṛjumati* is generally... while *vipulamati* is... Once *manaḥparyava-jñāna* is attained, it never goes away.
* **Kevalajñāna:** Direct knowledge of all times, all substances, and all categories, arising from the soul, like the all-seeing eye, infinite, transcendental, and unprecedented.

Through these five kinds of knowledge, all principles can be known. Through knowledge, the seeker can become aware of the first aspect of the three jewels, which are the cause of liberation. Like a maddened elephant, ignorance...

## The Nature of Darshan and Charitra Ratna

**Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verses 17-18**

**Verse 16:**

Like the sun that destroys darkness, like an extraordinary eye that illuminates the elements of the world, and like a net that subdues the deer-like senses, this right knowledge (Samyakgyan) is.

**Verse 17:**

Now, regarding the second Darshan Ratna, it is said:

> **"Ruchir Jinoktatattveshu, Samyak Shraddhanamuchyate. Jayate Tannisargena Guror Adhigamen Va."**

**Meaning:**

Having interest in the principles spoken by the Jineshwara Bhagwan is called Samyak Shraddha. This Samyak Shraddha arises naturally (from one's nature) or through the teachings of the Guru Maharaj (Adhigam).

**Explanation:**

Having interest in the principles of Jiva and other elements as spoken by Jineshwara is Samyak Shraddha (Darshan). Without Samyak Shraddha, there is no attainment of liberation. Even knowing the nature of vegetables, grains, etc., without interest, a person cannot obtain satisfaction or taste from them. Angaramardak, etc., who have Shrutagyan, but are Abhavya or Durbhavyas, do not have interest in Jinoktatattva, so they cannot obtain the true fruits of tapasya and other practices. This Samyak Darshan is of two types:

1. **Nisarga Samyaktv:** This is the natural Samyaktv that arises without the teachings of the Guru Maharaj.
2. **Adhigam Samyaktv:** This is the Samyaktv that arises through the teachings of the Guru Maharaj or by seeing an image, pillar, woman, or any other object.

In the whirlpool of the endless cycle of birth and death, the covering of knowledge (Gyanavaran), covering of vision (Darshanavaran), Vedaniya, and Antarayakarma are attached to the Jivas. The highest state of these karmas is 30 kotikot (trillions) of sagaropama. The highest state of Gotra and Namakarma is 20 kotikot, and the highest state of Mohaniyakarma is 70 kotikot sagaropama. In this state, just as many rough stones become round on their own as they roll and collide in a river flowing from a mountain, similarly, the state of each karma naturally decreases due to the combination of its own results. When only one kotikot sagaropama state remains, then each worldly being, due to the combination of Yathapravrittikaran, comes close to the Granthi-Pradesh. The results of attachment and aversion, which are very difficult to break, are called Granthi. It is like the original knot of the Rayan, which is very difficult to cut. Even the being who has reached the Granthi-Pradesh, due to being influenced by attachment, etc., again binds the highest state of karma and as a result, wanders in the four gatis. Among them, there are Bhavyas who will attain liberation in the future. They manifest their Mahavirya and break through the Granthi, which is difficult to break, just as a traveler crosses a long path and quickly reaches his desired destination. This is called Apurvakaran. After this, by doing Anivrittikaran, they break the groups of Mithyatva, which are capable of being broken, and at that very moment, they attain the Aupashmik Samyak Darshan, which is in the state of Antarmuhurt. This Samyak Darshan is called Nisarga Samyaktv. Ordinary beings attain Samyak Darshan through the teachings of the Guru Maharaj or through some kind of support. This is called Adhigam Samyaktv. This Samyak Darshan is like medicine for Yama and Prasham, and it is the cause of knowledge, character, and Shruta, etc. Even if Samyaktv is devoid of knowledge and character, it is still praiseworthy. But knowledge and character contaminated by the poison of Mithyatva are not praiseworthy. Even without knowledge and character, Emperor Shrenik, due to the influence of Samyaktv, earned the Tirthankara name karma, which is like an incomparable treasure of happiness. It is like a boat for those who are drowning in the ocean of the world. It is like a fire that burns the forest of suffering. Therefore, one should accept (obtain) the gem of Samyak Darshan.

**Verse 18:**

Now, the third Charitra Ratna is described:

> **"Sarva Savadya Yoganan, Tyagash Charitramishyate. Kirtitam Tadahinsadi Vratabheden Panchadha."**

**Meaning:**

Abandoning all sinful (Sadosha) actions is called Charitra. This Charitra is said to be of five types, according to the difference of vows like Ahimsa, etc.

**Explanation:**

Knowingly abandoning all Savadya, sinful actions of mind, speech, and body is called Charitra.

## The Nature of the Five Great Vows of the Ratnatray

**Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verses 19-22**

**Without knowledge and faith, conduct is not called right conduct. Here, the word "all" is used to distinguish it from the conduct of the worldly. Conduct has been divided into two parts - original qualities and subsequent qualities. One should adopt the five great vows from the conduct of the original qualities.** ||18||

**Now, the five great vows, the original qualities of conduct, are described.** ||19||

**Non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy, and non-possession: these are the five great vows. Each of these five great vows is endowed with five attitudes. These attitudes are (helpful) for liberation.** ||19||

**Explanation:** - There are five attitudes for each of the five great vows of non-violence, etc. Therefore, it is said that if the attitude is constantly awakened, the seeker can attain liberation from it. ||19||

**Now, the nature of the first great vow of non-violence is described.** ||20||

**That vow of non-violence is considered to be:** ||20||

**Not to kill any living being, whether mobile or immobile, through carelessness.** ||20||

**Explanation:** - Carelessness means ignorance, doubt, delusion, attachment, aversion, loss of memory, and acting contrary to the yogas of mind, speech, and body, and disrespecting dharma. Thus, carelessness is said to be of eight types. To kill any mobile (two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, and five-sensed) or immobile (earth, water, fire, air, and plant) being through the above-mentioned carelessness is violence. And the prohibition of violence or the protection of living beings is called the first vow of non-violence. ||20||

**Now, the nature of the second great vow is described.** ||21||

**Speaking words that are pleasant, beneficial, and truthful is called the vow of truthfulness. But that which is truthful, yet unpleasant or harmful, is not called truthful speech.** ||21||

**Explanation:** - Truthful speech, which is free from falsehood, is called the vow of truthfulness. That which gives joy merely by hearing it is pleasant speech, and that which is beneficial in the future is beneficial speech. To speak of a thing as it is, that is truth, that is truthful speech. Here, truth is an attribute of the vow of truthfulness. There is a doubt here: what is the purpose of mentioning these attributes of pleasant and beneficial along with truth? In answer to this, it is said that, "Many times, even though it is truthful in practice, to call a thief a thief or a leper a leper, etc., is unpleasant (shocking) speech, and therefore it is not called truth. Similarly, even if something is truthful, if it is harmful, it is not called truth. A hunter asks a truthful person in the forest, "Which way did the deer go? Did you see it?" If the truthful person says at that time, "Yes, I saw the deer going this way," then there is a possibility of animal cruelty in such a statement. Therefore, such speech, being harmful to animals, cannot be called truth even though it is truthful speech, because it is not beneficial (beneficial) to animals.

**The conclusion is that truthful speech that causes pain to others and is harmful in its consequences is not truth; rather, truthful speech that is pleasant and beneficial is the real truth.** ||21||

**Now, the third great vow is described.** ||22||

**Not taking what is not given is called the vow of non-stealing. The external life and wealth of people are theirs; those who take them are like those who kill them.** ||22||

## The Nature of the Great Vows

**Verse 23-24 of the First Light of Yoga Shastra:**

**Meaning:** Not accepting any object without the permission of its owner is called the vow of non-stealing (Asteya). Wealth is the external life force of humans; by stealing it, their life force is considered to be destroyed.

**Explanation:** Not accepting wealth or any object without the owner's permission or without giving it to them is called the third great vow of Adattadan. For renunciants, it is described as four types: 1. Swami-Adatt, 2. Jiva-Adatt, 3. Tirthankar-Adatt, and 4. Guru-Adatt.

* **Swami-Adatt:** Accepting grass, straw, stones, wood, etc., without the owner's permission or without their permission to take it.
* **Jiva-Adatt:** Accepting something from the owner, but not from the living being itself. For example, giving initiation to a person (living being) without their own consent, even though their parents or guru have given permission.
* **Tirthankar-Adatt:** Accepting food that is contaminated with the prohibited Adhakarma, etc., as forbidden by the Tirthankar.
* **Guru-Adatt:** Accepting an object that is free from Adhakarma, etc., and the owner has given permission, but the guru has not given permission to accept it.

All the vows after non-violence are for the protection of the first vow of non-violence. There is a doubt here: how is violence possible in Adattadan? In response, it is said that wealth is considered the eleventh external life force in social interactions. Due to the strong attachment to wealth, it is considered equal to life. Stealing it or losing it breaks the heart of the living being, causing great harm and even death. Therefore, the scholars have called wealth the external life force. From this perspective, the one who steals wealth is actually killing the owner of that wealth.

Now, regarding the fourth great vow:

**Meaning:** Renunciation of the desire for divine (divine-related) and worldly (lustful) pleasures through mind, speech, and body, as well as the act of causing others to do so and approval, is called Brahmacharya, which is of eighteen types.

**Explanation:** Renunciation of the enjoyment of sexual pleasure through mind, speech, and body, related to the divine body of the gods and the worldly body of humans and animals, as well as the act of causing others to do so and approval, is called Brahmacharya. It is said to be of eighteen types because it is of eighteen types of renunciation of sexual pleasure. Divine-related sexual pleasure is of nine types, as it is of three types (mind, speech, and body) and three types (act, cause, and approval). Similarly, there are nine types of renunciation of worldly sexual pleasure, making a total of eighteen types of Brahmacharya.

Just as the middle vows are explained in terms of mind, speech, and body, as well as act, cause, and approval, so too should the first and last great vows be understood.

Now, regarding the fifth great vow:

**Meaning:** Renunciation of attachment to all things in the world (living and non-living) is the great vow of Aparigraha. Even when there is no object nearby, the mind is constantly agitated by attachment.

**Explanation:** Renunciation of attachment to all things in the world (living and non-living) through mind, speech, and body, as well as act, cause, and approval, is called the great vow of Aparigraha. Simply giving up the object is not called renunciation. True renunciation is the renunciation of attachment, delusion, desire, passion, attachment, or affection towards that object.

There is a doubt here: if the vow of Aparigraha is achieved by renouncing attachment, then why is its characteristic described as the renunciation of attachment? In response, it is said that even in the absence of objects, attachment to substance, space, time, and feeling causes mental unrest and various types of mental fluctuations. A seeker with such an unstable mind cannot experience the peace of tranquility. Even without wealth, the desire for wealth creates impurity in the mind, like the beggar named Dramuk in Rajgriha, and it is the cause of falling into hell.

## The Nature of the Emotions of the Great Vows

**Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verses 25-26**

Even though it is composed of specific material with characteristics of substance, field, time, and emotion, the mind that is free from the affliction of the black serpent of craving, experiences the attainment of peace and happiness, and in it, there is complete stability. For this reason, the ascetics who observe the religious observances are described as being in the category of non-possessors, as they do not have attachment to their bodies and instruments. It is also said:

> "Just as a horse, even when adorned with ornaments, does not have attachment to them, similarly, a Nirgrantha muni, even when possessing some things as religious observances, does not have attachment to them." (Prashma 141)

Just as a muni does not incur blame by observing religious observances while in a state of unconsciousness, similarly, Nirgrantha sadhvis, who are devoted to the three jewels, also do not incur the blame of possession by observing religious observances without attachment, as per the instructions of their guru. Therefore, the statement of those who say, "For Nirgrantha sadhvis, religious observances are in the form of possession, and because of possessing, women do not attain liberation," is mere pralāpa (idle talk). ||24||

Now, the glory of the five emotions (which are helpful in attaining liberation) of each great vow is explained. ||25||

> "By the five emotions, the five great vows are imbued (animated), who cannot attain the imperishable (liberation) state?" ||25||

Meaning: Those who practice these great vows with their emotions, surely attain the state of liberation. ||25||

Now, the five emotions of the first great vow are explained:

> "The wise should cultivate the vow of non-violence with the five emotions of mental restraint, restraint in seeking, restraint in taking and placing containers, restraint in movement, and the taking of food and water after seeing." ||26||

Meaning: The wise ascetic should strengthen the vow of non-violence with these five emotions: mental restraint, restraint in seeking (food, water, etc.), restraint in taking and placing containers (for food, water, etc.), restraint in movement, and taking food and water after seeing (it). ||26||

**Explanation:**

1. The characteristics of the first emotion, mental restraint, will be explained later.
2. Restraint in seeking is to take only that food, water, or clothing, etc., which does not cause suffering to any living being.
3. Restraint in taking and placing containers is to take and place instruments like feet, foot-rests, clothing, containers, etc., in such a way that they do not cause harm to any living being.
4. Restraint in movement is to move with care, keeping one's gaze downwards while walking, so as not to harm any living being.
5. The emotion of taking food and water after seeing is to take food and water after seeing it, and even when taking food based on signs, to maintain the emotion of non-violence, so as not to harm ants, worms, etc.

Here, restraint and restraint in seeking are to be understood as the emotional form of the great vow. The three restraints, etc., will be explained in detail in this text later, so they can also be understood as secondary qualities.

It is also said: "Purity of the body, five restraints, emotions, two types of austerities, images, and non-possession are the divisions of secondary qualities." (Ni. Bha. 6534)

Now, see the emotion of mental restraint. All violence first arises in the mind. That is, mental activity is paramount in violence. It is heard that King-Sage Prasannachadra did not cultivate the emotion of mental restraint in the great vow of non-violence, and therefore, even though he did not commit violence externally, he once accumulated the karma-bundle worthy of the seventh hell. Restraint in seeking, restraint in taking and placing containers, and restraint in movement are very beneficial for the great vow of non-violence. Therefore, one should cultivate the inner mind with these emotions. The emotion of taking food and water after seeing (and the renunciation of food and water, including insects, etc., with this emotion) is also beneficial for the great vow of non-violence. Thus, the description of the five emotions of the great vow of non-violence is complete. ||26||

Now, see the five emotions of the second great vow...

## The Nature of the Sentiments of the Great Vows

**Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verses 27 to 29**

**27.**  By constantly abandoning laughter, greed, fear, and anger, and by speaking after careful consideration, one should strengthen the vow of truthfulness.

**Meaning:**  One should speak truthfully, abandoning laughter, greed, fear, and anger, and speaking only after careful consideration.  These five sentiments strengthen the vow of truthfulness.

**Explanation:**  A person may speak falsely when laughing and joking with others, when driven by greed and desiring wealth, when fearing for their life or reputation, or when agitated by anger.  These four sentiments, laughter, etc., must be abandoned.  The fifth sentiment is to speak thoughtfully and with right knowledge, rather than blindly and carelessly.  Attachment is the cause of false speech, as is well known in the world.  As it is said, "Speech uttered out of passion, hatred, or delusion is false."

**Now we describe the five sentiments of the third great vow.**

**28.**  To request a place to stay after careful consideration, to request it repeatedly from the owner, and to accept only as much space as is needed.

**29.**  To request a place to stay from a fellow practitioner of the same religion, to consume food and water only with permission, and to cultivate the sentiment of non-stealing.

**Meaning:**  Before staying in any place, a monk or nun should carefully consider the place and its owner, and request permission to stay there.  There are five types of places to stay:  the abode of Indra, the abode of a Chakravarti, the abode of a king, the abode of a householder, and the abode of a fellow practitioner of the same religion.  The abode of Indra is understood as follows:  Just as the sovereign Indra is considered the lord of the southern half of the world, and the sovereign Shakenndra is considered the lord of the northern half of the world, so too, in the case of a place where there is no owner in the common understanding, the owner of that place is considered to be Indra, according to the aforementioned principle.  The territory of a Chakravarti or a common king, such as Bharat, is considered their abode.  The owner of a house is considered the householder of that house.  Their abode is called the householder's abode.  In the scholarly definition, this is also called "Shayyatar" (the owner of a dwelling or house).  If monks or nuns are already staying in a place or house, and the householders have given them space, then that is considered the abode of a fellow practitioner of the same religion.  A newly arriving monk or nun should request permission to stay from them.  In this way, one should request permission to stay in a place, knowing each type of abode and following the proper procedure.

**(1)**  If one does not request permission from the owner, it can lead to conflict, unnecessary fighting, quarrels, and other worldly troubles.  Using a place without permission leads to the bondage of sinful karma.  One will also suffer in the afterlife.  This is the first sentiment.

**(2)**  One should repeatedly request permission from the owner for the place that has been granted once.  It is possible that the householder may object to the monk or nun using the place for other purposes, such as caring for a sick, weak, or bound monk or nun, or for washing their hands and feet or disposing of their waste.  Therefore, one should clearly explain the situation to the householder and request permission to use the space for these purposes, so that the giver of the abode is not troubled and remains happy.  This is the second sentiment.

**(3)**  The third sentiment is that the monk or nun should consider how much space they need for their meditation, study, and meals.  They should not need more than that, and should request and arrange for only that much space.  By accepting only that much space and performing their activities of contemplation, study, and meals within it, they will not trouble the giver.  Otherwise, the giver may have little space left for their own use, which could cause them trouble.

## The Nature of the Feelings of the Great Vows

**Regarding the first light of Yoga Shastra, verses 30 and 31, there is a difficulty. Even for a Sadhu, there is a possibility of carelessness in taking more than what is needed from the giver, in the process of transcription, cleaning (Poojan), etc. There is a possibility of anxiety arising in the mind of the giver, and the Sadhu himself incurs karmic bondage due to the consumption of unoffered food. This is the third feeling.** (4) Those who follow the same Dharma or are travelers on the same path of Dharma are called Sadharmic. Sadharmic Sadhus are equal in their attire, equal in their conduct and thoughts. The Sadhus who have accepted a particular area (place) before, the Sadhus who come later should stay there only after taking permission from them. Otherwise, it is considered theft. This is the fourth feeling. (5) According to the scriptural method, one should bring only the food and water that is free from defects, desirable, and acceptable, as alms, and after examining it, request the Guru Maharaj. Then, after taking the Guru's permission, one should eat in the group or alone. As a sign, one should keep in mind that "all the instruments that have medicinal or auxiliary differences, that is, the instruments in the form of Dharma-sadhana, should be used only after obtaining the Guru's permission. By doing so, the third Mahavrata is not violated. In this way, these five feelings of the third Mahavrata should be understood. ||29|| Now, we describe the five feelings of the fourth Mahavrata. ||30||**

**Stri-Shanḍha-Pashu-Madveshma-Asana-Kudya-Antar-Ujjhanat | Saraga-Stri-Katha-Tyagat Pragrat-Smriti-Varjanat ||30|| ||31|| Stri-Ramya-Angrekshan-Swanga-Sanskar-Parivarjanat | Pranita-Atyashan-Tyagad, Brahmacharya-Tu Bhavayet ||31|| (Yugmam)**

**Meaning:** The Brahmachari Sadhak should renounce the place where women, eunuchs, and animals live (and their seats or the places where they sit). Similarly, he should not stay in a place where words that are arousing or related to sexual intercourse are heard, even if there is only a curtain, a wall, or a partition in between. And he should renounce stories about women that arouse attachment. He should renounce the memory of past sexual activities. He should not look at the beautiful limbs of women. He should renounce the use of adornments or decorations that enhance the beauty of his body, and he should renounce food that is excessively delicious and beyond measure. In this way, one should protect the Brahmacharya Vrata through the five feelings within these ten Brahmacharya-Gupshis. ||30-31||

**Explanation:** It is essential for a Brahmachari man to be cautious of women, and for a woman to be cautious of men. There are two types of women in the world: Dev-Stri and Manushya-Stri. Both are living beings. But a woman in the form of a picture or a statue (made of wood, clay, etc.) is inanimate. Contact with both types of women is arousing. Similarly, a eunuch (one who has the third Veda rising) is filled with the great delusion karma and is attached to the enjoyment of both women and men. Animals like cows, buffaloes, mares, donkeys, goats, sheep, etc., also have the possibility of sexual intercourse. Therefore, the first feeling is explained. One should renounce the place where women, eunuchs, and animals live day and night. It is forbidden to sit even for a moment on the seat where they sit or on the bedding (Santhare) or the platform, etc., that they have used. Or, one should renounce the place where, upon staying there, one hears the arousing words of a couple behind a wall, a partition, or a curtain, as there is a possibility of violating Brahmacharya. This is the first feeling. Renouncing talking to women with attachment or telling stories about women. The country, caste, lineage, attire, language, gait, gestures, mind, examination, laughter, play, glances, love quarrels, or romantic conversations related to women are like wind, creating a storm of attachment and delusion in the sea of the mind. Therefore, it is essential to stay away from them. This is the second feeling. One who has taken Sadhu-Diksha or the Brahmacharya Vrata should not remember the sexual activities, embraces, etc., that he has done with women in the past. If he happens to remember, he should immediately renounce it. Because the fire of lust is further intensified by the fuel of remembering past sexual activities. Therefore, one should renounce it. This is the third feeling. One should not look at the beautiful, attractive face, eyes, breasts, thighs, etc., of women, which arouse lust in the mind, with a gaze of wonder or with a lustful gaze.

## The Nature of the Eight Sermons of the Mother

**Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verses 32-34**

Because the mind becomes agitated by seeing the beautiful limbs of women, adorned with beauty and grace; just as a moth is destroyed by falling on a flame, so too, one who looks with desire is consumed by the fire of lust. There is no fault in seeing if it is done without desire or aversion. It is also said, "It is impossible not to see the form of an object that comes into the field of vision of the eye. But a wise man should not have desire or aversion for that form."

Similarly, one should renounce the adornment of one's body with bathing, anointing, makeup, etc., decorating, perfuming, making nails and teeth shiny, grooming hair well, or using cosmetics, etc., and the various forms of adornment and beautification. A foolish man, engrossed in the adornment of an impure body, with his insane thoughts, needlessly throws his soul into the abyss of suffering. Thus, renouncing the desire to look at the beautiful limbs of women and the adornment of one's own body is included in the fourth sentiment.

Similarly, one should renounce the consumption of delicious, aphrodisiac, nourishing, sweet-tasting food, and even if the food is tasteless, one should not eat it in excess. That is, one should not stuff oneself with dry and bland food. Thus, a celibate should renounce both types of food. By constantly consuming nourishing, aphrodisiac, delicious, oily, juicy food, one strengthens the primary element in the body, and from that, the awakening of the Vedas occurs, which leads to the possibility of indulging in non-celibacy. Eating in excess not only destroys celibacy but also harms the body. It causes many diseases in the body, such as indigestion, etc. Therefore, it should be renounced. The Ayurveda Shastra says that a person should keep half of their stomach for food, including vegetables, two parts for water, and one-sixth for air circulation (Pindani. 650). Thus, the fifth sentiment is established.

In this way, the five sentiments of celibacy are explained, encompassing nine types of celibacy practices. || 31 ||

Now, the five sentiments of the fifth great vow are described:

|| 32 || In touch, taste, smell, form, and sound, one should renounce excessive attachment to these five objects of the senses. || 32 ||

|| 33 || In these same objects, which are not pleasing, one should completely renounce aversion. Thus, the five sentiments of the vow of non-possession (Aparigraha or Nirmama) are described. || 33 || (Pair)

**Meaning:** Renouncing excessive attachment to the five objects of the senses, which are pleasing to the mind, such as touch, taste, smell, form, and sound, and completely renouncing aversion to these same five objects, which are unpleasant, are the five sentiments of the great vow of non-possession (Aparigraha or Nirmama). || 32-33 ||

**Explanation:** One should renounce desire for objects of the senses, such as touch, etc., which are pleasing to the mind. One should not have aversion (hatred) for objects of the senses, such as touch, etc., which are unpleasant to the senses. A person who is attached has desire for pleasing objects and aversion for unpleasant objects. One who is neutral does not have any attachment or aversion for these objects because they are not affected by them. Aversion is inevitable with desire. Therefore, it is mentioned later. "Kinchan" refers to external and internal possessions. One who does not possess anything is called "Akichana." The meaning is that non-possession is another name for Aparigraha. It is the form of the fifth great vow. One should understand these five sentiments. || 32-33 ||

After describing the nature of the virtue of the primary qualities, now the nature of the virtue of the secondary qualities is described:

|| 34 || Or, the virtue purified by the five Samitis and three Guptis is called Samyak Charitra by the wise sages. || 34 ||

**Meaning:** The wise sages have called the virtue of the monks, purified by the five Samitis and three Guptis, as Samyak Charitra. || 34 ||

**Explanation:** Samiti means "Samyak Pravritti," i.e., the technical term for five types of actions, or, according to the teachings of the Arhats, the term for praiseworthy actions. Gupti means "protection of the soul." The control of the mind, speech, and body (actions of the mind, speech, and body) of a seeker is called Gupti. The virtue of the holy ones, purified by these five Samitis and three Guptis, is called Samyak Charitra by the wise sages. || 34 ||

## The Nature of the Eight Precepts (Aṣṭa Pravacana)

**The Nature of the Mother**

Yogaśāstra, the first light, verses 35 and 36, describe **samyak cāritra** (right conduct) as effort. **Samiti** is the nature of right conduct and the characteristic of **guptī** (secrecy) is the withdrawal from conduct. Both of these have the same characteristic. ||34||

Now, the names of **samiti** and **guptī** are mentioned. ||35||

**Īryā-bhāṣaiṣaṇādāna-nikṣepautsarga-sañikāḥ | Pañcāhuḥ samititisro, guptīstriyogani-grahāt ||35||**

**Meaning:** Ī-samiti, bhāṣā-samiti, eṣaṇā-samiti, ādāna-nikṣepa-samiti, and uccāra-prasravaṇa-khelajalla-siṅghāṇapariṣṭhāpanikā (utsarga) samiti; these are the five samitis, and there are three guptīs which restrain the three yogas; these are said to be of three types, namely, mano-guptī (mental secrecy), vacana-guptī (verbal secrecy), and kāya-guptī (physical secrecy).

**Explanation:** The above five samitis are right conducts. The restraint of the activity of the mind, speech, and body (āgama) by the method, i.e., stopping the conduct of the yoga of the mind, speech, and body while going on the right path, is called guptī by the Tirthankara Bhagavān.

Now, the characteristic of **īryā-samiti** is mentioned. ||36||

**Lokātivahīte mārge, cumbite bhāsvadāṃśubhiḥ | Janturakṣārthamālokya, gatirīryā matā satām ||36||**

**Meaning:** The movement done by the virtuous ones, looking down on the path where people come and go, and where the rays of the sun fall, for the protection of living beings, is considered **īryā-samiti**. ||36||

**Explanation:** While going for necessary work, the initiated sadhu, in order to give protection to all living beings, both mobile and immobile, and for the protection of his own body, looks from the front part of his feet to the area of the measure of a dhūsra (a unit of measurement) while walking, this is called **īryā-samiti**. The meaning of **īryā** is conduct, movement, and the meaning of **samiti** is to do right conduct. That is, doing right conduct in the act of walking is called **īryā-samiti**. The implication is that the muni, with his hands (on the ground), looks at the ground, protecting seeds, greenery, living beings, water, earth-bodied beings, etc., while walking on the ground. If there are stones, pillars, mud without water, a river, etc., on the path, and there is another path, then he should not go on that path. (Daśa. Vai. 5/3-4) Movement is done on the path, therefore, the characteristic of the path is mentioned, "The path on which the rays of the sun touch, which is very active and uninterrupted due to people coming and going." That is, the path should be clearly visible, and the rule is to walk on that path. The muni does not harm the six-bodied living beings by the path mentioned in the first adjective. One should not walk on a bad path either, for this reason, it is said that walking on the path mentioned by the people at night, flying beings coming from above are harmed. In darkness, there is a possibility of harm to the living beings and oneself due to the living beings coming under the feet or by a poisonous creature. Therefore, to prohibit walking on such a path, the second adjective says to walk in the rays of the sun. If a muni walking like this harms a living being, even then, he does not incur the sin of killing a living being. It is said that:

**1] Uccāliyammi pāe iriyāsamiāss sankamatṭhāe | Vāvajjejj kulingī marejj yā tām jogamāsajj || || Na yā tassa tannimitto bandho suhamovi desio samaye | Aṇavajjo uyogāeṇa savvabhāvena so jamhā ||**

The muni, walking with effort, with **īryā-samiti**, while walking, lifts his feet, if by chance, a two-sensed being, etc., dies, then the scriptures say that he does not incur any karmic bondage due to that, because this is a blameless conduct done with equanimity and for the sake of all beings. And, if one conducts oneself without effort and without blame, then whether a living being dies or not, he will definitely incur the sin of violence. And, the one who walks with right conduct, with effort, and for the sake of all beings, if by chance, he commits violence, then he does not incur karmic bondage due to that violence. (Ogh Ni. 748-749) ||36||

Now, regarding the second **bhāṣā-samiti**, it is said...

**Explanation:** According to the study of Vaakya Shuddhi (seventh study in Dasha Vaikalik Sutra), one should completely abandon harsh words like "You are a cheat," "You are lustful," "You eat meat," "You are a thief," or "You are an atheist." One should speak in a language that is pure and free from faults.  The speech should be beneficial to all, pleasant, limited, and sufficient to fulfill the purpose. It is said, "One should speak words that are sweet, wise, short, necessary for achieving the goal, free from pride, generous, hopeful, held in the mind before speaking, and righteous." [Upadesh 80] This type of speech is called Bhaasha Samiti, or being careful in speaking in the right way. This kind of language is pleasing to the Munis. The scriptures state that a wise seeker should not speak a language that is false, or untrue, and not practiced by the learned (Dasha. 7/2). ||37||

Now, we will describe the third Eshanasamiti. ||38||

**38.** Dvichatvārishta-Bhikshaadoshainitayamadūshitam | Muniryadannamaadatte, Saeṣhāna-Samitirmata ||38||

**Meaning:** The Muni who takes food and water always free from 42 faults of Bhiksha is called Eshana Samiti.

**Explanation:** The 42 faults associated with Bhiksha are divided into three categories: (a) Udgam Dosha, (b) Utpadan Dosha, and (c) Eshana Dosha. ||38|| (Pi. Ni. 92-93)

The first sixteen faults of Udgam are committed by householders. They are as follows:

1. Adhakarma, 2. Auddeshik, 3. Pootikarma, 4. Mishrajat, 5. Sthapana, 6. Prabhriti, 7. Pradushkaran, 8. Krit, 9. Pramityak, 10. Parivartita, 11. Abhyahrit, 12. Udbhinna, 13. Malapahrit, 14. Aachhedya, 15. Anisrishta, and 16. Adhyavapurka.

1. **Adhakarma:**  If a householder, with the intention of offering food to a Muni, prepares food with a mind that is not pure, or prepares food that is not pure, and the Muni accepts it, then the fault of Adhakarma is incurred.

2. **Auddeshik:** If a householder prepares food specifically for a particular Muni, and makes it extra delicious with ghee, sugar, yogurt, spices, etc., then the fault of Auddeshik is incurred.

3. **Pootikarma:** If a householder mixes impure food with pure food with the intention of offering it to the Muni, then the fault of Pootikarma is incurred.

4. **Mishrajat:** If a householder prepares food with the intention of eating it themselves and also offering it to the Muni, then the fault of Mishrajat is incurred.

5. **Sthapana:** If a householder prepares food like kheer, laddoos, or peda, and keeps it aside with the intention of offering it to the Muni, then the fault of Sthapana is incurred.

6. **Prabhriti:** If a householder prepares food for a festival or wedding that is going to happen in a few days, but the Muni is present now, and the householder thinks that the food will be useful for the Muni as well, then the fault of Prabhriti is incurred. Or, if the festival is approaching, but the householder delays it thinking that the Muni will arrive then, and they will get the benefit of offering food, then the fault of Prabhriti is incurred.

7. **Pradushkaran:**  If a householder searches for an object in the dark using fire or a lamp, or breaks a wall or curtain to bring something out, then the fault of Pradushkaran is incurred.

## The Ten Aeshana Doshas of Bhikachari

**7. Krodha Pind:** Taking food by intimidating householders with threats of curses or by showing anger due to the influence of knowledge, penance, etc., or by saying that one's worship is done by the king, etc.

## The Nature of Bhikshacharya - Faults in the Time of Going for Food

**Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verse 306**

**6. Dayak:** If the giver is a very young child, an old person, an impotent person, or someone whose hands and feet are trembling, who has a fever, is blind, arrogant, or insane, or whose hands and feet are cut off, who is bound by chains, who is pounding, grinding, roasting, or preparing vegetables, who is spinning cotton, sowing seeds, or eating, or who is violating the six living beings, then if the sadhu takes food etc. from such a giver, it is considered a Dayak fault. If a woman who is about to give birth, a woman carrying a child, or a woman breastfeeding a child, gives food etc., then also the Dayak fault is incurred.

**7. Unmisra:** If the substance to be given, such as sugar, is mixed with grains etc., and the sadhu takes that food, it is considered an Unmisra fault.

**8. Aparinat:** If any substance is given to the sadhu without being completely purified, then the Aparinat fault is incurred.

**9. Lipta:** If the giver gives food etc. with hands smeared with oil or ghee, or with hands that have touched food, then it is considered a Lipta fault.

**10. Chardit:** If the giver gives food while dropping drops of oil, ghee, milk, or yogurt on the ground, and the sadhu takes it, then it is considered a Chardit fault. This is because, like drops of honey falling down, there is a possibility of violating many beings.

Thus, the faults of origin, production, and consumption total forty-two.

To consume food etc. that is free from these two faults, water from a Sauvira well etc. as per the auspicious signs, and clothes, utensils, etc. like Rajoharan, Mukhavaskrika, and Cholpatta, which are suitable for the Sthavirakalpis, fourteen types of medicinal equipment suitable for the Jinakalpis, twelve types of equipment suitable for the Sadhvis, twenty-five types, and the auxiliary equipment like Santhara (seat), Pat, Patta, Bajot, Charmadanda, Dandasan, etc., which are free from the aforementioned faults, to accept them is called Eshanasamiti.

It is impossible to observe the Mahavrata in the cold, heat, and rainy seasons without medicinal equipment like Rajoharan etc., and auxiliary equipment like Patta, Pat, Patla, Bajot, Shayya, Chauki, etc., on cold, sunny, or wet ground. Therefore, the Muni should search for all these essential things for life, including food etc., which are free from the aforementioned faults, faultless, conceivable, and pure. This is called Eshana.

To investigate food etc. according to the method mentioned in the Agam, and to strive for its proper use with diligence, is also Eshanasamiti.

This Eshana is of two types, based on the distinction between investigation and consumption. The meaning of Grasaeshan is that when the sadhu-sadhvi sits in the food circle and takes a bite of food into their mouth, even then the following five faults should be avoided.

**1. Sanyojana:** To make food tasty and spicy or juicy, to mix sugar, ghee, or hot spices etc. (suitable for making food tasty) with the food items that have come in the Gochari, either in the shelter or outside, to make them tasty or spicy, is the first fault of Sanyojana.

**2. Pramanatiriktata (Aapraman):** One should eat only as much food as is necessary to maintain the body, keeping the fortitude, strength, restraint, and the yoga of mind, speech, and body stable. Eating more than the required amount leads to many diseases like vomiting etc., and sometimes even death. Therefore, eating more than the required amount is considered the second fault of Pramanatiriktata or Aapraman.

**3. Angar:** While eating, praising the delicious food items like sweets etc., or praising the giver of those items, saying "Oh! How beautiful it is! How delicious it is! How generous the giver is!" This kind of statement fuels the fire of attachment, which turns the fuel of character into embers. Therefore, the third fault is called Angar fault.

**4. Dhum:** If one eats while criticizing the tasteless or bland food, or the one who gave it, then the sadhu incurs the fourth fault of Dhum. Just as smoke blackens the picture gallery of a palace, so too does the sadhu's criticism, like smoke, pollute the palace or picture gallery of character.

**5. Karanaabhav:** The fifth fault of Karanaabhav is not mentioned in the text.

## The Nature of the Eight Precepts Mother

**A Sadhu should take food for six reasons:**

1. **Kshudha:** When unable to bear hunger.
2. **Acharya-Adi:** To serve and show devotion to elders.
3. **E-Samiti:** To properly follow the eight precepts, including the E-Samiti.
4. **Preksha-Utpreshka:** To maintain restraint.
5. **Prabadh:** To protect life from the arising of digestive fire.
6. **Aart-Roudra-Dhyan:** To abandon agitated and angry meditation and attain stability in Dharma meditation.

**If a Sadhu takes food for any other reason, they incur the fifth fault called "Karana-Abhav."**

It is said: "The purification, investigation, and detailed analysis of food free from the eight food faults - Udgham, Utpadan, Eshna, Samyogan, Apruman, Angar, Dhum, and Karana-Abhav - is explained by the Eshna-Samiti for the sake of Munis."

**Now, the fourth Adan-Nikshep-Samiti is described:**

"Taking or placing things after carefully observing the Asana and other things, and cleaning them with Rajo-haran, is called Adan-Nikshep-Samiti."

**Explanation:**

Asana refers to the ground or mat used for sitting. The word "Adi" includes things like clothes, vessels, belts, staffs, and other equipment. The meaning is that a Sadhu should carefully observe all their Dharma-Upakaran with their eyes during the day. At night, if they cannot see living beings, they should carefully clean them with Rajo-haran or a Guchhak, and then lift or place them. If this is not done, proper "Pratilekhana" does not occur.

The scriptures say: "When performing Pratilekhana, if one talks to others, engages in worldly conversations, rejects others, or reads or listens to others, then that Sadhak is a violator of the Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Plants, and Tris-Kaya beings, and is negligent in Pratilekhana."

Therefore, whatever equipment is lifted or placed, one should first look at it, then clean it with Rajo-haran, and then take or place it. This type of action is called Adan-Nikshep-Samiti. Just as Bhima is referred to as "Bhim" in short, here the long name of this Samiti is referred to as "Adan" in short.

**Now, the fifth Utsarg-Samiti is described:**

"A Sadhu who carefully discards phlegm, urine, feces, and other things that need to be discarded on a ground free from living beings, is called Utsarg-Samiti."

**Explanation:**

Phlegm and mucus coming out of the mouth, nose, etc., urine, feces, etc., are generally considered impure and discarded substances of the body. The word "Prayah" should be understood to include broken or leftover clothes, vessels, food, water, etc., that need to be discarded. Carefully discarding all these things on a non-sentient ground free from Tris-Sthavar-Jantu, in dust or sand, is called Utsarg-Samiti.

**Now, regarding the first of the three "Guptis" - Manogupti:**

"The protection of the mind from the web of imagination, its stability in equanimity, and its immersion in the contemplation of the Self, is called Manogupti by wise men."

**Explanation:**

Here, Manogupti (protection of the mind from its negative tendencies) is described as three types:

1. **Separation of the mind from the web of imagination arising from Aart-Dhyan and Roudra-Dhyan.**
2. **Establishment of the mind in Madhyastha-Parinati or equanimity, which is in accordance with the scriptures, conducive to the afterlife, and involves Dharma-Dhyan.**
3. **Immersion of the mind in Atma-Ramanta, i.e., the state of being the Self, by stopping skillful and unskillful mental activities and creating a state of Yoga-Nirodha.**

From this perspective, Manogupti...

## The Nature of the Eight Precepts Mother

The first light of Yoga Shastra, verses 42 to 44, describe three specific qualities and say that "freeing the mind from suffering, anger, and meditation, establishing it in the nature of the self, and dwelling in the qualities of the self are the true means of mind control. This is called मनोगुप्ति (manogupti)." || 41 ||

**Explaining the concept of अवाप्ति (avapti)**

|| 42 || By abandoning gestures and the like, the reliance on silence, or the restraint of speech, or the practice of right speech, is called वाग्गुप्ति (vaggupti) here. || 42 ||

**Explanation:** - संज्ञा (sanjna) means - to indicate one's intention to others through the mouth, eyes, raising the eyebrows, pointing with a finger, or snapping fingers; the word "आदि" (adi) includes throwing pebbles, coughing loudly, making a "hum" sound, etc. These actions are also considered संज्ञा (sanjna). Abandoning all these संज्ञा (sanjna) and remaining silent by stopping the act of speaking, or restraining or reducing the flow of speech and practicing right speech is called वचनगुप्ति (vacanagupti). If a silent practitioner indicates their intention through संज्ञा (sanjna) etc., their silence becomes ineffective. However, if it is necessary to recite scriptures, ask questions related to them, or answer questions, then there is no conflict with the world or the scriptures in this वाग्गुप्ति (vaggupti). Similarly, speaking with a cloth covering the mouth or controlling speech is another type of वाग्गुप्ति (vaggupti). These two types represent the complete restraint of impure speech, the protection of the speech organ from impure speech, or the practice of silence. This is the explanation of these three forms. भाषासमिति (bhasasamiti) is speaking correctly, and वाग्गुप्ति (vaggupti) is the correct protection of speech from impurities. This is the difference between वाग्गुप्ति (vaggupti) and भाषासमिति (bhasasamiti). Therefore, it is said that "the one who practices समिति (samiti) is definitely the one who practices गुप्ति (gupti); but the one who practices गुप्ति (gupti) may or may not be the one who practices समिति (samiti) (the one who worships)." When speaking skillfully, the practitioner is endowed with both वाग्गुप्ति (vaggupti) and भाषासमिति (bhasasamiti). (Bri. Ka. Bha. || 4451) || 42 ||

|| 43 || Even in the face of adversity, the steady state of the body of a silent sage who is engaged in कायोत्सर्ग (kayotsarga) is called कायगुप्ति (kayagupti). || 43 ||

**Explanation:** - Adversity is caused by gods, humans, and animals. Here, the word "अपि" (api) should be understood as an indication of hunger, thirst, and other twenty-two afflictions, or difficulties arising from evil deeds, or lack. The meaning is that remaining indifferent to the body in the face of all these adversities, etc., and keeping it steady or still, or restraining the fickleness of the yogas, is called कायगुप्ति (kayagupti). || 43 ||

Now, we explain the second type of कायगुप्ति (kayagupti).

|| 44 || Control (regulation) over actions or movements in lying down, sitting, placing, taking, and walking, etc., and abandoning spontaneous activity is the second type of कायगुप्ति (kayagupti). || 44 ||

**Explanation:** - The scriptures state that night is the time for sleep. From this perspective, the virtuous are primarily prohibited from sleeping during the day. Except for illness, weakness, fatigue from travel, or old age, etc., the practitioner should not sleep during the day. Even at night, after one watch has passed, when the Guru Maharaj has gone to sleep, the practitioner should look for a limited (according to their height) place, purify the ground, spread the संस्तारक (sanstarak) (sitting mat), and spread the उत्तरपट्टा (uttarpatta) (upper mat). After purifying the body from head to toe (top to bottom) with मुखवस्त्रिका (mukhavastrika) (face cloth), प्रमार्जनिका (pramardanika) (cleaning cloth), and रजोहरण (rajoharan) (dust remover), the practitioner should ask permission from the Guru Maharaj to spread the संस्तारक (sanstarak) (bedding), recite the नमस्कारमंत्र (namaskaramantra) (salutation mantra) and the सामायिक सूत्र (samayik sutra) (Samayik Sutra), make a pillow with the right hand, curl the feet, or place the feet in the air like a rooster, purify them with the प्रमार्जनिका (pramardanika) or the buds of the रजोहरण (rajoharan), and then place them on the ground. Then, when contracting, purify with the प्रमार्जनिका (pramardanika) or the buds of the रजोहरण (rajoharan), and when turning over, use the मुखवस्त्रिका (mukhavastrika)

## Discourse on Eight Mothers and 35 Qualities of a Dharma-Adhikari

**Discussion on the Motherhood of Eight Mothers and the 35 Qualities of a Dharma-Adhikari**

**Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verses 45-46**

Cleanse the body with the first light of Yoga Shastra, verses 45-46. However, do not sleep excessively at either time. Wherever you stay, in a space of three hand-spans, each Sadhu should keep all their utensils, including their bowl. Before sitting on any seat or place, inspect it with your eyes and cleanse it with a broom. Sit on a mat that is clean and free of dust. If you need to stretch or fold your legs after sitting, inspect and cleanse the area as mentioned before. During the four months of the rainy season, sit on a Darbha-asana (seat made of Darbha grass) or a mat, following the above practices. Inspect and cleanse the staff and other utensils. If a Sadhu needs to go outside for essential work, they should look ahead in a space of three hand-spans, and with mindfulness, protect both mobile and immobile beings, walking slowly. When standing or sitting with support, one should first look around and remove any obstacles, then cleanse the area with a staff. Controlling all these actions and abandoning spontaneous movements is another type of bodily restraint. ||4||

Now, the five committees and three secrets are described as motherhood, as is well-known in the scriptures. ||45||

**Meaning:** The five committees and three secrets mentioned above are known as the "Eight Mothers" because they give birth to the body of a Sadhu's character, nurture it, and purify it, keeping it clean and pure. ||45||

**Explanation:** The committees and secrets are known as the "Eight Mothers" in the scriptures. The reason for this is that just as a mother gives birth to her child's body, nourishes it with milk, and keeps it clean by removing waste, these Eight Mothers give birth to the body of a Sadhu's character, protect it from harm, nourish it, and purify it from any impurities. ||45||

Now, we conclude by describing character. ||46||

This character is for all the great ascetics who have renounced everything. For those who are devoted to the Dharma of an ascetic, it is partial, depending on the country. ||46||

**Meaning:** There are two types of character: complete renunciation and partial renunciation. Complete renunciation is the complete abandonment of all harmful actions. This complete renunciation is the essence of the primary and secondary qualities. Who is the one who practices partial renunciation? In response, it is said that since the word "country" has many meanings, here it also means that a householder who practices partial renunciation should be deeply devoted to complete renunciation. A householder has a partial character, depending on the country. What is a householder? Due to living in the household, they are entangled in the affairs of family, livelihood, and other worldly matters, and due to the faults of association and other things, they cannot practice complete renunciation. It is also said, "A Shravaka who practices partial renunciation desires complete renunciation." Without devotion to the Dharma of an ascetic, it is possible for a householder to practice the vows of a Shravaka, but when their vows are violated from time to time, it is only possible to purify them through criticism, atonement, warnings, and the observance of the vow of hospitality if there is an ascetic who practices complete renunciation. Therefore, it is essential for householders to be connected to ascetics. ||46||

1. **Vrishi-Peetha, etc., are mentioned in the book, page 66.**
2. **For this reason, it is forbidden for a Shravaka to stay in an area where a Sadhu does not reside, as it is essential for them to be in the presence of a Sadhu.**

## Discussion on the 35 Qualities of a Dharmadikari Following the Path

**How can a householder with Deshaviriti-Charitra become a Dharmadikari?** To explain this, we begin with the phrase "Tathahi" as an introduction.

**Qualities of a Dharmadikari following the path:**

**47.** Possessing wealth acquired through righteous means, a devotee of good conduct, marrying someone from a family with similar good character, and actively engaging with others from different lineages.

**48.** Fearful of sin, following the established customs of the land, not being prejudiced against anyone, especially not against kings or other dignitaries.

**49.** Living in a place that is neither too hidden nor too exposed, with a good neighborhood, and a house that does not have many entrances and exits.

**50.** Always associating with virtuous people, honoring one's parents, abandoning places of trouble, and not engaging in blameworthy activities.

**51.** Spending according to one's income, dressing according to one's wealth, possessing the eight virtues of intelligence, and listening to Dharma every day.

**52.** Abstaining from food when indigestion occurs, eating at the right time and in a way that suits one's constitution, fulfilling the three goals of life (Dharma, Artha, Kama) without hindering each other, and serving guests, saints, and the poor and needy according to one's capacity.

**53.** Always free from false claims, impartial in matters of virtue, and abandoning inappropriate customs and times.

**54.** Knowing the strengths and weaknesses of things, abandoning them accordingly, being steadfast in one's vows and rules, honoring those who are knowledgeable and elderly, and supporting and nurturing dependents.

**55.** Having foresight, being knowledgeable, grateful, beloved by the people, modest, compassionate, gentle, and dedicated to helping others.

**56.** Focused on eliminating the six internal enemies (lust, anger, greed, attachment, pride, and jealousy), controlling the senses, and being fit for the duties of a householder.

**Meaning:**

1. **Nayasampanna-Vibhava:** A righteous householder should first abandon acts like betrayal of the master, betrayal of friends, treachery, and theft, and acquire wealth through good conduct and justice according to their caste. Wealth acquired through righteous means is beneficial in this world. One who possesses wealth acquired through righteous means can enjoy its fruits without any guilt and can also share it with friends and relatives.

## A Commentary on the 35 Ethical Rules According to the Dharmadikari Path
**Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verses 47-56**

A virtuous man, who earns through his own efforts and strength, is self-respecting and pure in every place. A sinner, who engages in evil deeds and stains his soul with misdeeds, is doubtful in every place. A righteous householder can use his justly earned wealth for the benefit of the next life by giving it to the seven worthy recipients (Sapt-Kshetra) and by showing compassion to the poor, orphans, etc. However, wealth accumulated through injustice brings harm in both worlds. Unjust actions are against the welfare of the world and result in punishment, imprisonment, and disgrace in this life. In the next life, such sins lead to hell and other miserable states. It may be that an unjust and unethical person does not face any calamity in this life due to the karmic effect of virtuous deeds. However, he will surely face calamity in the future or in the next birth. It is said, "A being blinded by the attachment to wealth, inevitably receives the fruits of his sinful actions at some point. Like meat pierced with thorns, the sin will not end without its destruction." Therefore, earning wealth through justice and with a view to the ultimate good is the best course of action. It is said, "Just as frogs are drawn towards water bodies and birds towards full lakes, so too, all wealth comes under the control of a person who performs good deeds." Since wealth is the primary factor in household life, the first quality is called "Nyaya Sampanna Vibhav" (justly earned wealth).

**2. Etiquette - The Appreciator**

A refined man is one who observes vows, practices austerities, and serves the learned. He has received pure education, especially has good conduct. For example, he fears public censure, rescues the distressed, respects every human being, is grateful, and possesses the qualities of generosity. (Yoga Bindu 126) A man with all these qualities is called a virtuous man (Shista). A righteous householder should be an appreciator and supporter of his conduct and thoughts. The conduct of refined men is as follows: they do not abandon a good place in times of difficulty, they follow great men, they earn their livelihood through a popular and just profession, they do not engage in blameworthy actions even when facing death, they never beg from wicked people, and they do not ask for even a little money from friends. Truly, who taught this difficult and hard vow, like a river of swords, to the virtuous? It is the virtuous themselves who taught it.

**3. Marriage with a Person of the Same Lineage and Character but Different Gotra**

A person with a lineage (Khanadani) similar to that of his ancestors, father, grandfather, etc., and with the same character and virtuous conduct, such as the abandonment of vices like alcohol and meat, is called "Sama Kula Shila." A man of such lineage and character is called "Ek Gotriya" (of the same Gotra), while one born in a different Gotra is called "Bhinna Gotriya." The implication is that a righteous householder should marry a person of the same lineage and character but a different Gotra. Taking the hand of a woman in the presence of fire (and the five elements) is called marriage. Marriage is said to be of eight types in social practice: 1. Giving a daughter in marriage after adorning her with clothes and ornaments is called Brahma marriage. 2. Giving a daughter in marriage after investing wealth is called Prajapati marriage. 3. Giving a daughter in marriage with the gift of a cow, bull, etc., is called Arsha marriage. 4. The marriage in which the host gives the daughter as a gift to the priest performing the Yajna as Dakshina is called Daiva marriage. These four are called Dharma marriages. 5. Secretly forming a love relationship with mutual attraction without the permission of parents or brothers is called Gandharva marriage. 6. Giving a daughter in marriage under the compulsion of a condition is called Asura marriage. [A marriage where the groom demands dowry before the wedding is Asura marriage]. 7. Abducting a girl by force and marrying her is called Rakshasa marriage. 8. Abducting a girl who is asleep or in a state of unconsciousness and marrying her is called Pishacha marriage. These four are considered unrighteous marriages. If the marriage is done with the consent and happiness of both the groom and the bride, even an unrighteous marriage becomes a righteous marriage. Marriage with a pure girl of good lineage and character is beneficial and successful. However, a marriage with a bad woman or man brings harm in this life as well.

## Dharmadikari - Discussion on the 35 Qualities of a Marganusari
**Yoga Shastra Pratham Prakash Shloka 46 to 56**

| Klesh - Kalha happens, and one gets hell even in the afterlife. 1 The benefits of a pure, noble, and chaste housewife coming into a family are: 1. She protects the bride, 2. She gives birth to good sons and makes them cultured, 3. There is unbroken peace in her mind, 4. She keeps the household well-organized, 5. She protects the purity of the family traditions, 6. She ensures proper respect for Gods, Guru, guests, relatives, friends, etc. in the house. Similarly, the ways to protect the bride are: 1. To assign her household duties, 2. To give her appropriate wealth, 3. To prevent her from being free and not to encourage her towards independence, 4. To give her maternal affection like that of a woman in the group of women and teach her to behave in the same way.
―
4. Papbhiru - One who is afraid of sins due to visible and invisible suffering is called Papbhiru. He commits sins like theft, adultery, gambling, etc., which are well-known (seven vices) and cause direct harm in this world. They are the cause of worldly ironies. It is said in the scriptures that one has to suffer immense pain due to drinking alcohol. These are the indirect causes of harm.
5. Follower of the Famous Customs - A good householder should not easily abandon the traditional dress, language, attire, food, etc., which are accepted by the noble people and have been followed for a long time. He should follow the various customs and practices prevalent in his entire clan, which are accepted by them. By violating the customs of the country or caste, a person becomes an object of hatred and a cause of misfortune for the people of that country and caste.
6. Not Being a Varnawadi - Varnawad means criticism. A good householder should not criticize anyone, whether the person is low, middle, or high. Criticizing others will lead to hatred, malice, and animosity in the mind, and it will also increase many other faults. By criticizing others and praising oneself, a person commits a low-caste karma, which manifests in many births. This low-caste karma does not leave even after millions of births. Thus, when general social criticism is harmful, then what to say about the criticism of kings, ministers, priests, etc., who are accepted by the majority? Therefore, one should especially avoid criticizing such special people, as it immediately leads to adverse consequences.
7. The Place of Residence of a Good Householder - The house where a good householder lives should not have many doors, as having many doors leads to fear of theft, adultery, etc. Therefore, while prohibiting many doors, it is said that a householder should live in a house with fewer doors and a secure house, and the house should be in a suitable place. Where there is no pile of bones, no sharp thorns, and where there is a lot of grass, plants, corals, plants, and lush vegetation around the house. Where the soil is of good color and fragrant, where the water is tasty, such a place is considered auspicious. The merits and demerits of a place can be known by the power of Shakun Shastra, Swapna Shastra, or the scriptures on that subject. Similarly, the place is described in more detail: 'That house should not be too exposed and not too hidden. Being too exposed, i.e., being in a completely open place, increases the possibility of trouble. And being too hidden, being surrounded by houses on all sides, hides the beauty of the house. It is very difficult to escape from such a house in case of fire. Then what kind of place should it be? So it is said that the third thing to look at in relation to the house is the presence of good, virtuous neighbors. Bad or dirty neighbors, who will be near the house, their conversation will be heard, and their behavior will be seen.
-
1. A girl who has broken her chastity with male friends in the present and has not purified herself by doing penance is considered a bad woman. This statement applies to a girl who has broken her chastity willingly.

## Discussion on the 35 Qualities of a Dharmadikari as per the Path

**Considering verses 46 to 56 of the Yoga Shastra, the first light, even the qualities of virtuous people can be lost.**  The scriptures describe bad neighbors as follows: prostitutes, maidservants, eunuchs, dancers, beggars, mendicants, paupers, Chandals, fishermen, hunters, sorcerers-tantrics (Aghoris), low-caste Bhils, etc. Having such neighbors is not good. Therefore, one should not build a house near such neighbors. (Ogh Ni. 467) [Currently, one should not build a house near alcoholics, gamblers, thieves, atheists, etc., and near movie theaters.]

**8. Association with the Virtuous:** For a good householder, the company of the virtuous is of great importance. Those who engage in activities beneficial in this world and the next are considered good company. Association with wicked people, cheats, adulterers, bards, cruel people, soldiers, clowns, etc., destroys one's character. Ethicists have said, "If you associate with virtuous men, your future will improve, and if you associate with wicked people, your future will be destroyed."  Firstly, attachment (Sanga) is completely to be abandoned, but if one must associate, then one should associate with virtuous men, because the company of virtuous men is like medicine.

**9. Reverence for Parents:** The good householder is considered excellent who salutes his parents three times a day; engages them in afterlife-beneficial religious practices; honors and respects them; and obeys their commands in every action. He offers them flowers, fruits, etc., with good color and fragrance, before using them himself. He feeds them first and then eats himself.  Those who do not do this will not have a tradition of humility in their family; and there will be many unruly, uncultured, talkative, and quarrelsome people. Therefore, every householder should serve, worship, and revere his parents. The mother is given the first place because she is more worthy of worship than the father. Therefore, instead of saying "father-mother," we say "mother-father," and the mother is given the first place. The Manusmriti says, "A teacher is equal to ten Upadhyayas, a father is equal to a thousand teachers, and a mother is equal to a thousand fathers." Therefore, the mother's glory is greater. (Here, understand worldly Upadhyaya and Acharya.)

**10. One who Quickly Leaves a Troubled Place:** If there is fear from one's own kingdom or from the kingdom of another country, famine, epidemic diseases, a great war breaks out, or there is unrest everywhere in a place, village, or city due to opposition from the people, and there is fighting and quarreling day and night, then the good householder should leave that place immediately. If he does not leave that place, he will destroy the dharma, wealth, and desires he has earned before, and he will not be able to earn new ones, thus ruining both his worlds.

**11. One who Abandons Reprehensible Actions:** A good householder should not engage in actions that are reprehensible from the perspective of the country, caste, and family. For example, from the perspective of the country, farming in the Sauvira country and drinking alcohol in the Latadesh country are considered reprehensible. From the perspective of caste, drinking alcohol, trading in sesame seeds, salt, etc., are considered reprehensible for Brahmins. From the perspective of family, drinking alcohol is considered reprehensible in the Chalukya dynasty. Thus, those who engage in such reprehensible actions from the perspective of country, family, and caste, even if they perform other good religious deeds, are considered objects of ridicule among people. [Currently, the trade of blue films, wine, meat exports, etc.]

**12. Spending According to Income:** A good householder should always spend with the thought, "How much is my income?" Before spending money for his family, for the maintenance of his dependents, for his personal use, and for the worship and hospitality of deities and guests, he should see how much income he has from his farming, animal husbandry, or business, etc. He should spend accordingly. Ethics says, "Give charity according to what you have earned in business, etc., consume according to your profit, and save a reasonable amount for safekeeping."

## Dharmadikari - Discussion on the 35 Qualities of a Marganusari
## Yogashastra Pratham Prakash Shloka 46 to 56

**(Safe)** should be kept as a treasure (in times of crisis).’ Many ethicists have said - ‘According to earnings | Four divisions should be made. (Panch Su. 2) One-fourth of one's income should be kept in reserve (safe). One-fourth in interest or business, one-fourth in religious work and consumption, and one-fourth in the maintenance of dependents.’ Some | ethicists say that, ‘Out of the earned amount, more than half should be spent on religious works and the remaining small amount should be actively spent on the work of this world. If a householder spends inappropriately, then just as a disease that grows day by day weakens the body, so too does excessive daily waste | makes a man incapable of all good conduct. It has also been said - that whoever spends excessively like Kubera without keeping an account of income and expenditure, becomes a beggar in a short time.

-

13. Dress according to wealth - A good householder should wear clothes, • ornaments etc. according to his wealth, status, wealth, age, country, time and caste. Whoever does not dress according to his status or wealth; but shows off by wearing flashy clothes, becomes a laughing stock among people. People | can tell from his flashy or expensive clothes that he must have earned money by dishonesty, injustice, oppression or reprehensible deeds. Or people start suspecting about him that nowadays he must be earning a lot | because he spends so lavishly and wears such fine, expensive clothes. Another meaning of this is that even if there is income, he does not spend it frugally; even though he is wealthy, he wears bad, dirty, torn clothes, then he also becomes an object of censure among people and he cannot become a follower of Dharma.

14. A good householder should possess the eight qualities of intellect - A good householder should possess the following eight qualities of intellect - 1. Shushrusha, 2. Shravan, 3. Grahan, 4. Dharan, 5. Uha, 6. Apoh, 7. Arth-Vigyan and 8. Tattvajnan | Their meaning is as follows - 1. Shushrusha - Desire to listen to Dharma Shastra. 2. Shravan - Listening to Dharma. 3. Grahan - Accepting after listening. 4. Dharan - Keeping it in mind by holding it so that the heard word is not forgotten. 5. Uha - Reasoning about other meanings besides the known meaning. 6. Apoh - Moving away from the opposite meaning from utterance (Shruti), reasoning and experience | or separating oneself from things that harm the soul like violence etc. | Or Uha means general knowledge and Apoh means analysis of special knowledge. 7. Arth-Vigyan - Obtaining specific correct knowledge of the object by removing delusion and doubt through the combination of Uha and Apoh and 8. Tattvajnan - Obtaining pure definite knowledge from a special type of knowledge of Uha | Apoh. Thus, the householder who acquires the intellectual qualities from Shushrusha to Tattvajnan; he never does his own harm. Therefore, a good householder should adopt these eight intellectual qualities as much as possible.

-

-

15. Daily Dharma-Shravan-Karta - A good householder should be engaged in listening to Dharma, which is the cause of progress and liberation (Moksha). The mind of those who listen to Dharma daily is very far from restlessness and experiences joy. Its benefits have been told that listening to Dharma - lectures is useful, it is a good saying, it removes the anxiety of a frightened person, | calms the one who is tormented by the three kinds of suffering, the ignorant person gets enlightenment from it and the disorganized, restless mind becomes stable. Therefore, daily Dharma-Shravan is helpful in the progressive growth of qualities in life. There is a slight difference between Shravan (desire to listen) and Shravan (listening) mentioned in the qualities of intellect.

16. Leaving food during indigestion - A good householder should leave food during indigestion. One should not eat new food until the previously eaten food is digested. Because it is said in medical science that indigestion is the root of all diseases and eating during indigestion (indigestion) aggravates the disease. Indigestion can be recognized by its signs. | Bad smell from stool and apanavayu due to their decay, heaviness of the body, loss of appetite, sour and bad belches, these are the signs of indigestion.

## Discussion on the 35 Qualities of Dharmadikari-Marganusari
**Yoga Shastra Pratham Prakash Sloka 46 to 56**

**17. Eating Pathya Food at the Right Time**

It is essential for a Sadgrihastha (householder) to eat food in accordance with their nature, taste, digestive fire, and capacity, without attachment, when they feel hungry. If they eat more than their capacity, they will suffer from vomiting, diarrhea, indigestion, or other diseases, and may even die. Therefore, overeating is not advisable. However, even nectar consumed without hunger becomes poison. And if one eats after the time of hunger has passed, they will experience aversion and disgust towards food, and suffer pain in the body. "Adding fuel to a fire after it has been extinguished is useless."

Consuming food and water that are suitable for one's body and capacity, and that are enjoyable, is called "Satmya." Such Satmya, if practiced throughout life, even if the food is poison, will be beneficial once. One should consume only those foods that are Pathya (suitable) even if they are excessively Satmya. One should not consume unsuitable and harmful substances, even if they are considered Satmya due to their taste. "Everything is beneficial for the strong," do not consume poison thinking this way. Even a person who is knowledgeable about poisons and highly skilled can die from poison at some point.

**18. Practicing the Three Purusharthas (Goals of Life) Without Hindrance**

Dharma, Artha, and Kama are called the three Purusharthas. Dharma is that which leads to Abhyudaya (worldly progress) and Moksha (liberation). Artha is that which fulfills all worldly purposes. Kama is the pleasure derived from the senses, born out of pride, and associated with all sensual pleasures. A Sadgrihastha should practice these three Purusharthas in such a way that they do not hinder each other. However, it is not advisable to practice only one or two of them.

Ethics experts also say, "Without practicing the three Purusharthas - Dharma, Artha, and Kama - in a way that does not contradict each other, a person is no different from a blacksmith's bellows, breathing but not truly alive." If someone neglects Dharma and becomes greedy for worldly pleasures, they become like a wild elephant, prone to disaster. Because one who is indifferent to Dharma and Artha and is excessively attached to sensual pleasures will lose Dharma, Artha, and their body, becoming dependent and miserable. Similarly, one who neglects Dharma and Kama and is solely focused on earning wealth will not experience true joy in life nor find mental peace. Ultimately, others will enjoy their wealth. Sons-in-law, partners, the government, or others will seize their wealth. They will only be left with their hard work. Just as a lion, by killing an elephant, only becomes a partaker of sin, so too will they only become a partaker of sin.

It is not appropriate for a householder to neglect Artha and Kama and only practice Dharma, because they have duties towards their family, society, and country. If they become engrossed in solitary religious practices, they will become irresponsible and unhappy. They will have to depend on others for their livelihood. Therefore, while Sadhus (ascetics) can fully dedicate themselves to Dharma, householders are often unable to do so. They can worship and serve the Shramans (ascetics). Therefore, one should practice Artha and Kama in a way that does not hinder Dharma. A farmer who eats the seeds meant for sowing will suffer with his family due to a lack of seeds in the future. Similarly, a person who does not practice Dharma in the present will not attain happiness or welfare in the future. Truly, only that person is happy who experiences the happiness of this world in a way that does not hinder the happiness of the next birth.

One who abandons earning wealth and only practices Dharma and Kama becomes indebted. One who abandons Kama and only practices Dharma and Artha becomes a misfortune for their household, and their family members remain dissatisfied. Therefore, a householder who completely neglects Kama cannot sustain their household life.

A householder who practices each of the three Purusharthas in isolation becomes like a Tadatmik, Mulahar, and Kadarya, hindering their own growth. A Tadatmik is one who spends their earned wealth without thinking. A Mulahar is one who consumes the wealth inherited from their ancestors or other forefathers in an unethical manner. A Kadarya is one who...

## Discussion on the 35 Qualities of Dharmadikari-Marganusari

**Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verses 46 to 56 states:** One who gathers wealth by troubling servants and himself, but does not spend it in the right place, does not benefit from it. The destruction of wealth by Datvik and the destruction of Dharma and Kama by Malhar do not lead to the welfare of both. The wealth of Kadarya is taken away by the government, officials, or thieves. That wealth does not remain for his Dharma and Kama. Therefore, it is stated here that a householder should not obstruct the unimpeded enjoyment of the Trivarga. If, by chance, the time comes when there is an obstacle in the enjoyment of any of these Purusharthas, then one should abandon the enjoyment of the subsequent Purushartha and protect the previous Purushartha from the obstacle. For example, if there is an obstacle in Kama, then one should protect Dharma and Artha from obstacles. Because with Dharma and Artha, Kama can also be easily obtained. If there is an obstacle in Kama and Artha, then one should protect Dharma. Because the root of Artha and Kama is Dharma. A wise person has said, "Even if I have to beg for my livelihood, if Dharma is protected, I consider myself wealthy." Indeed, the virtuous are wealthy with Dharma-like wealth.

**19. Hospitality towards Guests etc.** - A virtuous householder must welcome guests who come to his house. A guest is one who has no fixed date due to his constant focus on the beautiful tendency of self-welfare. Ethicists have said, "One should consider as a guest the great soul who has renounced the celebration of dates and festivals; and the rest as visitors." Sadhu-Sadhvi-gana are always praiseworthy in the entire world, without fixing any date or festival. Therefore, they are excellent guests. The implication is that one should properly honor guests, Sadhus, and the poor, whose power to worship Dharma, Artha, and Kama has become weak. The synonym for date is day. Both the words day and Din are derived from the root 'Do Avakhandane' (meaning destruction). Therefore, Din is also taken in the sense of a guest. On the one hand, there is only one quality of righteousness, and on the other hand, there is a sea of qualities without righteousness; even then, those qualities are like poison. That is, one should give to a virtuous guest with devotion, and to the poor, the distressed, and the orphans and the disabled with compassion; this is the right way.

**20. Always Stay Away from Attachment** - A virtuous householder should always stay away from false attachment. Attachment is called false attachment. A person with false attachment is one who is ignorant of the path of righteousness and starts a task with stubbornness to belittle or defeat others. Therefore, it is said, "Egotism brings failure to the lowly, it breeds unrighteousness, vices, and regret from the beginning of the task." The habit of swimming against the current is a futile effort like that of aquatic fish. In fact, a person with attachment is stubborn and arrogant. He suffers from his own vices. Therefore, a virtuous householder should be free from attachment. Since the absence of attachment is sometimes seen even in lowly people, but it is deceitful. Therefore, the word 'always' is used here.

**21. A Supporter of Virtue** - A virtuous householder should be a supporter of virtues and virtuous people by their characteristics. The intention is that whenever virtuous people come into his contact, he should behave with them with courtesy, kindness, generosity, and seriousness. He should welcome them with loving words like "Come, please come"; he should also honor virtuous people from time to time, praise them, give them prestige; be helpful in their work, take their side; etc. Such a person who is partial towards virtuous people and towards his own self-righteousness, which is the form of self-virtue, certainly sows the seeds of merit and obtains a wealth of virtues in the afterlife.

**22. Renunciation of Forbidden Country, Time, and Conduct** - A virtuous householder should abandon the conduct that is forbidden in a particular country and time. If someone stubbornly adopts forbidden country customs or prohibited time customs, he often faces the harassment of thieves, robbers, etc.; he also suffers a loss of Dharma.

**23. Knower of Strength** - A virtuous householder should know the strength of his own or another's wealth, territory, time, and feelings.

##  Reflections on the 35 Qualities of a Dharmadikari-Marganusari

**All actions should be initiated after considering one's strengths and weaknesses, as per the teachings of Yogashastra, First Light, verses 46 to 56. Failure to do so often leads to adverse consequences. As the saying goes, "Even with strength, one who endures grows stronger, just as the body strengthens with nourishment. But actions undertaken without considering one's strength lead to the depletion of body, wealth, and other possessions."**

**24. Reverence for Vrittasthas and Gnanavruddh: Those who are steadfast in following the right conduct, abandoning wrong conduct, are called Vrittasthas. A householder should respect them in every way. One should revere those who are great in the knowledge of reality or those who are companions of Vrittasthas, who are Gnanavruddh. Reverence means serving, offering salutations with folded hands, providing a seat, standing up in respect upon their arrival, offering respect and honor, etc. By revering Vrittasthas and Gnanavruddh, one inevitably receives the fruits of good advice, like a Kalpavriksha (wish-fulfilling tree).**

**25. Nourishing the Dependent: It is the responsibility of a righteous householder to provide sustenance to their family, including mother, father, wife, son, daughter, and others who are dependent or related. They should take care of their well-being. This will ensure harmony and cooperation from all. In the future, they will all become useful.**

**26. Farsighted: A righteous householder should be farsighted before undertaking any action. They should consider the benefits and drawbacks of the action from its inception to completion. Farsightedness means thinking ahead in every action.**

**27. Expert: A righteous householder should also be an expert. An expert is one who knows the difference between objects and non-objects, actions and non-actions, self and others. One who is certain of reality is truly called an expert. An unexpert does not understand the difference between a person and an animal. Or, specifically, one who knows the qualities and defects of the soul is called an expert. It is said, "A person should observe their character daily, whether their conduct is like that of an animal or like that of a righteous person. This observation is the root of virtue and prosperity."**

**28. Grateful: A righteous householder should be grateful. Gratitude means knowing the kindness done by others. A grateful person does not forget the kindness of others. In return for the benefit of well-being received from the benefactor, one should honor them. Gratitude cannot be repaid. And it is said of the ungrateful, "There is no redemption for the ungrateful." The ungrateful forget the kindness done to them. One should not become like that.**

**29. Beloved of the People: It is essential for a righteous householder to be popular. One can be popular only if they possess qualities like humility, modesty, service, simplicity, empathy, compassion, etc. Who does not love virtues? Everyone is attracted to virtues. Those who lack popularity, through hatred, malice, enmity, conflict, or opposition, not only corrupt their own religious practices but also incite and provoke others, filling them with selfishness and becoming instrumental in corrupting their understanding.**

**30. Shameful: The quality of shame is paramount for a righteous householder. A shameful person will hesitate and feel ashamed while committing any sinful act. They will not abandon their vows and rules even if their life is at stake. The wise say that shame is the mother of many virtues. It is like the pure-hearted Aryamata (noble mother). By acquiring shame, the seeker remains steadfast in truth and principles. Shameful, strong-willed great souls abandon even comforts and life, but never abandon their accepted vows.**

**31. Compassionate: Compassion is an important quality of a righteous householder. The desire to alleviate the suffering of living beings is called compassion. As Prasham (168) says, "Just as a person cherishes their own life, so too do all living beings cherish their own lives. Therefore, a righteous householder should never miss an opportunity to show compassion." A person desires compassion for themselves in times of distress, so they should show compassion to all living beings.**

**32. Gentle: The nature and appearance of a righteous householder should be gentle. A cruel appearance and a terrifying nature**

## Discussion on the 35 Qualities of a Dharma-Adhikari (Dharma-Follower)

**Yoga Shastra, First Light, Verses 46-56**

A person who is agitated creates distress in others, and their impact is temporary. On the other hand, a gentle person attracts everyone, causing no fear but rather influencing them.

**33. Diligent in Performing Acts of Charity:** A righteous householder should also engage in acts of charity. They should not be solely focused on their own self-interest. A person who is a champion of charity and diligent in charitable acts is like nectar to the eyes of all.

**34. Dedicated to Eliminating the Six Internal Enemies:** A righteous householder is always dedicated to eliminating the six internal enemies. For refined householders, these six internal enemies are: 1. Lust, 2. Anger, 3. Greed, 4. Pride, 5. Arrogance, and 6. Envy.

* **Lust:** Desire for sexual intercourse with another's wife, whether married or unmarried.
* **Anger:** Becoming enraged without considering the consequences for oneself or others.
* **Greed:** Not giving to those who deserve charity and accepting another's wealth without reason.
* **Pride:** Not accepting someone's worthy advice due to stubbornness.
* **Arrogance:** Causing unnecessary suffering to others and finding pleasure in harmful activities like gambling and hunting.
* **Envy:** Feeling resentment and jealousy towards someone's progress.

These six are harmful and should be abandoned. It is said:

1. **Lust:** The one who lusts after a Brahmin girl, the one who rapes her, and the one who enjoys the "Dandakya" feast with his relatives and the kingdom, all perished. Similarly, the "Vaideha Karala" also perished.
2. **Anger:** The one who attacked the Brahmins due to anger, Janamejaya, and the one who terrorized the Bhrigus, Talajangha, both perished.
3. **Greed:** The one who seized the wealth of all four classes due to greed, Aila (Pururava), and the one who ruled the Sauvira region, Ajabindu, both perished.
4. **Pride:** Due to pride, Ravana and Duryodhana perished because they refused to return another's wife.
5. **Arrogance:** Due to arrogance, Ambhodbhava and the Haihaya (Kartavīrya Arjuna) perished.
6. **Envy:** Due to envy, Vatapi perished for obtaining Agastya, and the community of Shri Krishna perished for not obtaining Dvaipayana.

**35. Eager to Control the Senses:** A righteous householder should practice controlling their senses in a reasonable manner. The one who abandons the freedom of the senses, relinquishes excessive attachment to them, and restrains the passions of touch, etc., conquers the senses. Such a person attains great wealth. It is said:

"Indriyanam asanyamah, apadaam kathithah panthah | Tajjayah sampada margah, yeneeshtan ten gamyataam ||"

"The lack of control over the senses is the path to misfortune, and conquering them is the path to wealth. Choose the path that seems beneficial to you and proceed."

These senses are the essence of life. They are both heaven and hell. They are both. The one who controls them attains heaven, and the one who allows them to roam freely on the wrong path attains hell. Complete restraint of the senses is possible only for the virtuous. Here, the context is of a righteous householder who is on the path to becoming a Shravaka (Jain lay follower). Therefore, it is considered necessary for them to practice reasonable control over their senses.

A righteous householder possessing these 35 qualities becomes eligible for the Shravaka Dharma.

**47-56**

Thus, the first light of the "Adhyatma Upanishad," a treatise written by Acharya Hemchandrasuri, composed at the request of King Kumarapala, is complete, along with its own explanation.

|| Om Arhate Namah || 2. The Nature of Right Faith (Samyaktvam)

Previously, the description of a worthy householder, a follower of the path, was given. However, the Shravak Dharma is for a special worthy householder who is endowed with the twelve vows, including the five Anuvratas. This Shravak Dharma, which is based on the twelve vows, is rooted in Right Faith (Samyaktvam).

Therefore, we now explain the nature of Right Faith, the foundation of Shravak Dharma. 57. The five Anuvratas, the three Gunavratas, and the four Shikshavrata; these twelve vows together constitute the Shravak (householder) Dharma, which is rooted in Right Faith. ||1||

Meaning: The five Anuvratas, the three Gunavratas, and the four Shikshavrata; these twelve vows together constitute the Shravak (householder) Dharma, which is rooted in Right Faith. ||1||

Explanation: The root cause of the Shravak vows is Right Faith (Samyaktvam). In other words, Right Faith is the foundation of the twelve vows. The five Anuvratas, such as non-violence, are called Anuvratas because they are smaller than the Mahavrata (great vows). They are the fundamental virtues. The three Gunavratas, such as those related to direction, measurement, etc., are called Gunavratas because they are the virtues that lead to liberation. The four Shikshavrata, such as Samayik, are called Shikshavrata because they are meant to be practiced repeatedly. This is why the Shikshavrata are distinguished from the Gunavratas. Out of these twelve vows, the five Anuvratas and the three Gunavratas are generally observed by the householder Shravak for their entire life. ||1||

Since the twelve vows are rooted in Right Faith, we now explain the nature of Right Faith. 58. The understanding of the divine (Arhant, etc., the liberated ones) as divine, the understanding of the Guru as worthy of respect, and the pure understanding of Dharma; this is called Right Faith. ||2||

Meaning: The understanding of the divine (Arhant, etc., the liberated ones) as divine, the understanding of the Guru as worthy of respect, and the pure understanding of Dharma; this is called Right Faith. ||2||

Explanation: We will explain the characteristics of divinity, worthiness, and Dharma later. Essentially, Right Faith is defined as the pure, unwavering faith in the divine, the Guru, and Dharma, free from ignorance, doubt, and wrong perception. Although the same interest in the principles of Jina is also a characteristic of Right Faith for both the Sadhus and the Shravaks; however, for householders, it is appropriate to establish the reverence for the divine, the Guru, and the principles of Dharma, and to perform worship and practices accordingly. Therefore, for them, Right Faith is defined as the understanding of the divine, the Guru, and the principles of Dharma.

There are three types of Right Faith: Aupashmik, Kshayopa-shmik, and Kshayik. Aupashma refers to the state of non-arising of the four karmas that are destroyed by the destruction of false belief (Mithyatva-mohaniya karma) and the four infinite karmas (Anantanu-bandhi karma) - anger, pride, deceit, and greed, which are like fire covered with ashes. Right Faith with this type of Aupashma is called Aupashmik Right Faith. It lasts for a moment (Antarmukhurta) and is experienced by the soul that has been in the state of false belief (Mithyatva) since beginningless time. It is experienced by beings in all four realms of existence. Alternatively, it is experienced by a seeker who has ascended the ladder of Aupashma. Therefore, the scriptures state that a person who has ascended the ladder of Aupashma experiences Aupashmik Right Faith. Alternatively, a person who has not performed the three bundles (of karmas) but has destroyed false belief (Mithyatva) attains Aupashma Right Faith.

The second type of Right Faith, Kshayopa-shmik Right Faith, is the complete destruction (Samul-nash) of the four karmas that are destroyed by the destruction of false belief (Mithyatva-mohaniya karma) and the four infinite karmas (Anantanu-bandhi karma) that have arisen, and the non-arising of those that have not arisen. This type of Right Faith, which is characterized by both destruction (Kshaya) and non-arising (Aupashma), is called Kshayopa-shmik Right Faith. The Right Faith associated with Kshayopa-shma is called Kshayopa-shmik Right Faith. This Right Faith is also called Vedak Right Faith because it involves the experience of the fruits of good deeds. Aupashmik Right Faith, on the other hand, is devoid of the experience of the fruits of good deeds. This is the difference between Aupashmik and Kshayopa-shmik Right Faith. The knowers of truth have said, "In Kshayopa-shmik Right Faith, the soul experiences the fruits of good deeds to some extent.

## The Nature of Mithyatva, the Opposite of Samyaktv, and its Types

**Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verses 1-3**

This verse explains the nature of Mithyatva, the opposite of Samyaktv, and its types.

**Verse 1:**

A being with subdued passions, while in the state of *Upshamik Samyaktv*, cannot experience the joy of good deeds. (Vibha. 1290) Therefore, the state of *Kshayopa-shamik Samyaktv* is like the vast ocean, encompassing 66 *Sagars*. It is said that a being in *Kshayopa-shamik Samyaktv* goes to the *Devaloka* (heavenly realm) twice and is mostly born as a human. (Vibha. 434) *Kshayopa-shamik Samyaktv* is a state that persists throughout all time, compared to all other beings. The third type, *Kshayik Samyaktv*, is the complete eradication of the four *Kshayas* (passions) - *Mohaniya* (delusion), *Ananta-anubandhi* (infinite attachments), etc. This state is infinite and eternal.

**Verse 2:**

The glory of *Samyaktv* is described in these verses: "Samyaktv is the root of the *Bodhivriksha* (tree of enlightenment), the gateway to the city of virtue, the foundation of the palace of liberation, and the treasure of all wealth. Just as the ocean is the foundation of all jewels, so is *Samyaktv* the foundation of all virtuous jewels and the vessel of the wealth of character. Just as wealth cannot exist without a vessel, so too, character cannot exist without *Samyaktv*. Who would not praise such a noble *Samyaktv*? Just as darkness cannot endure the rising sun, so too, ignorance cannot endure the presence of a person imbued with *Samyaktv*. *Samyaktv* is like a barrier that prevents the doors to the animal realm and hell from opening. *Samyaktv* is like a key that unlocks the doors to the joys of heaven, the human realm, and liberation. If a being does not have a *Ayushya-bandha* (life-span) before attaining *Samyaktv*, and does not abandon *Samyaktv* before having a *Ayushya-bandha*, then that being will not have another life-span except as a *Vaimanik Deva* (celestial being). Even if a being has only tasted *Samyaktv* for a moment and then abandoned it, they will not wander in the four realms of existence for long. And what can be said of a person who enjoys *Samyaktv* for a long time and always maintains it? Such a being will quickly become the possessor of the joy of liberation.

**Verse 3:**

The true nature of *Samyaktv* can be understood by knowing its opposite. Therefore, we will now explain the nature of *Mithyatva*, the opposite of *Samyaktv*.

**Verse 3:**

"To have the belief of divinity in something that is not divine, to have the belief of a guru in something that is not a guru, and to have the belief of righteousness in something that is not righteous, this is *Mithyatva*. It is called *Mithyatva* because it is the opposite of *Samyaktv*."

**Explanation:**

*Mithyatva* is present in a person who believes in divinity in something that is not divine, who believes in a guru in something that is not a guru, and who believes in righteousness in something that is not righteous. This is *Mithyatva* because it is the opposite of *Samyaktv*. *Mithyatva* is the belief in the non-divine, the non-guru, and the non-righteous. The direct characteristic of *Mithyatva* is to understand it as the opposite of *Samyaktv*. It should also be understood that *Mithyatva* is the belief in the non-divine in something that is divine, the non-guru in something that is a guru, and the non-righteous in something that is righteous.

*Mithyatva* is of five types: *Abhigrahik*, *Anabhigrahik*, *Abhiniveshik*, *Sanshayik*, and *Anabhogik*.

1. **Abhigrahik:** This type of *Mithyatva* is present in a person who, like a hypocrite, is skilled in defending their own false beliefs and opposing the truth.
2. **Anabhigrahik:** This type of *Mithyatva* is present in a person who, like an ordinary uneducated person, is easily swayed and believes in all gods without any critical thinking. They accept all gurus and religions without any investigation.
3. **Abhiniveshik:** This type of *Mithyatva* is present in a person who, even though they understand the truth, clings to false beliefs and, like a *Jamali* (a type of bird), denies the truth and holds onto falsehood.
4. **Sanshayik:** This type of *Mithyatva* is present in a person who is doubtful and uncertain about the truth.
5. **Anabhogik:** This type of *Mithyatva* is present in a person who does not experience the truth and therefore does not understand it.

## The Form of a Deva

**Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verses 3 to 44.**

**5. Doubtful (Sāṃśayika):** When a person remains in a state of doubt regarding Deva, Guru, and Dharma, wondering "Is this true or that true?", there is Doubtful Mithyatva.

**5. Non-Experiential (Anābhōgika):** Just as one-sensed (Ekaindriyadi) beings are devoid of thought and special knowledge, similarly, when a person's mind becomes inert and does not think about Samyaktva or Mithyatva, there is Non-Experiential Mithyatva.

Thus, there are five types of Mithyatva. (Pancha San. 186)

Here are some verses regarding Mithyatva:

"Mithyatva is a great disease, Mithyatva is great darkness, Mithyatva is the great enemy of the soul; Mithyatva is great poison. Disease, darkness, and poison cause suffering only once in life, but if the disease of Mithyatva is not treated, it causes suffering for thousands, millions, and billions of births. The soul whose mind is enveloped in deep Mithyatva does not know the difference between truth and falsehood. How can a blind person from birth know the beauty or ugliness of any object? ||3||

Now, describing the characteristics of Deva and Adeva, Guru and Aguru, and Dharma and Adharma, we first describe the form of Deva. 60.

**"Sarvajño Jitragādidoṣastrailōkyapūjitaḥ | Yathāsthitārthavādī ca Devō'rhan Paramēśvaraḥ ||4||"**

**Meaning:** The Deva, Arhan, or Paramēśvara is the one who knows all, has conquered the vices of attachment, aversion, etc., is worshipped by the three worlds, and speaks the truth as it is. ||4||

**Explanation:** Four excellences are considered essential for the Deva-tattva. They are: 1. Excellence of Knowledge (Jñānātiśaya), 2. Excellence of Freedom from Suffering (Apāyapagamātiśaya), 3. Excellence of Worship (Pūjātiśaya), and 4. Excellence of Speech (Vachanātiśaya).

By describing the Deva-ādhideva Arhan as "Sarvajña" (all-knowing), the excellence of his knowledge is indicated. He knows all beings, non-beings, and other principles. However, his knowledge is not like that of other philosophers whose scriptures contain contradictory statements. Other philosophers say, "Look at all the things in the world, whether you see them or not, see the desired principle. How many insects are there in the dung of insects? What use is this knowledge to us? See far and wide or not; we should only see what is useful to us. If those who see far are to be considered as evidence, then worship the vultures who have farsightedness." (Prā. Vā. 1/33-35)

But Jain philosophy says, "The knowledge of a desired object cannot be obtained without the knowledge of all objects. Without the comprehensive knowledge of every principle, both in its ordinary and extraordinary forms, in relation to other principles, no single principle can be known with its characteristics and its opposite, in terms of affirmation and negation."

It is also said, "He who has seen one principle in all its forms knows all principles (all principles in the form of substance, category, and modification) in essence; he who has seen all principles in all their forms has seen one principle in essence."

The second epithet, "Jitragādidoṣaḥ" (who has conquered the vices of attachment, aversion, etc.), indicates the excellence of freedom from suffering of the Bhagavan Deva-ādhideva Arhan. Apāya means obstacle or vice. It is well known throughout the world that vices like attachment, aversion, lust, anger, greed, and delusion are obstacles to self-realization, they pollute the soul, and therefore they are vices. Therefore, Bhagavan Deva-ādhideva has overcome these vices and conquered them forever.

The implication is that Arhan Deva has banished all these vices forever. Many people who are ignorant of this principle say, "It is just a verbal embellishment to say that a man is free from attachment, aversion, etc." But this statement is erroneous. How can one who has not conquered the vices of attachment, aversion, etc., attain the Deva-ādhideva-tattva? Therefore, it is not even possible to imagine that Arhan Deva is possessed by attachment, aversion, etc.

The third epithet of Arhan Deva, "Trailōkyapūjitaḥ" (worshipped by the three worlds), expresses his excellence of worship. A person cannot be considered a Deva simply because of the worship and devotion offered by a few deluded beings of good intellect; rather, the true sign of Deva-tattva is when the Devas of the moving and stationary worlds, the Asuras, and the intelligent humans who speak various languages of different countries, all become united in friendship, abandoning their mutual racial hatred, and even the animals compete to enter into their presence.

## The Characteristics of the Supreme Arhan, Possessing Four Atishayas

**Verse 4 & 5 of the Yoga Shastra, Second Light**

The praise of the Lord, the performance of Anjali Puja, the glorification of His virtues, and the enjoyment of the nectar of Dharmadeshana create a kind of competition among people. When even the gods are seen worshipping Him, then the true vision of His Devadidevatva (Supreme Divinity) is realized.

The epithet "Yatha-sthita-artha-vadi" (one who speaks the truth of a thing as it is) reveals the Lord's Vachana-atishaya (excellence of speech). One who speaks of a thing in its true form, as it is, can be called a Yatha-sthita-artha-vadi. As stated in the Veetrag Stuti: "Even if we want to test you impartially, we know for sure that we cannot compare you, the Veetrag Deva, with the Ragi-Dveshi Deva (passionate-hateful god). Because your quality of speaking the truth as it is, is considered to be a binding nectar that automatically restricts the qualifications of other gods." (A-yog 32:22)

Whether the bowing down by the likes of Surendra is considered as disregard for others by you, or whether you are considered equal to others, how can others disregard you because of your quality of speaking the truth as it is? (A-yog 12)

The Devadidev Arhan - the word "deva" is derived from the root "divu kreeḍa vijigīshu..." which, according to word etymology, means "divyate iti devaḥ" - that which is worshipped or praised is a deva. Such a deva, possessing the aforementioned powers and characteristics, can only be the Supreme Lord, the Devadidev Arhan, and no other. ||4||

Now, an earnest request is being made to worship, serve, and be devoted to such devas possessing four Atishayas, to accept their rule (Dharma-sangha), to meditate with them in front, and to seek their refuge. ||61||

**Verse 5**

**Dhyatavyo'yam upasyo'yam ayam saranam ishyataam | Asyaiva pratipattavyam, shasanam cetana'sti cet ||5||**

**Meaning:** If you have the consciousness-intellect to discern between right and wrong, then you should meditate on such a deva, worship him, seek his refuge, and accept his rule (Dharma-sangha). ||5||

**Explanation:** One should meditate on such a Devadidev possessing Atishayas, in the form of Pindastha, Padastha, Roopastha, and Roopateet, like King Shrenik. King Shrenik meditated on the color, form, institution, and strength of the Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira Swami, and his 34 Atishaya-filled yogic qualities. Due to the influence of this meditation, he will become the first Tirthankara named Padma-nabha in the coming 24th cycle, possessing the same color, form, institution, strength, and Atishayas. We have also said in praise: "You have previously meditated on Mahavira Paramatma with a focused mind, so you will surely be a Tirthankara with the same form." Truly, the effect of yoga is amazing! The Agam also says: "Just as Arihant Shri Mahavira Bhagwan is endowed with good conduct and morality, you will be endowed with the same good conduct and morality in the form of Shri Padma-nabha Arihant." Therefore, one should serve and worship this deva. The condemnation of our misdeeds and the approval of our good deeds can save us from the fear and suffering of the world, with the help of this deva. Therefore, desire to take refuge in him. Do not accept other rules (Dharma-sangha) described (instructed) by men devoid of the aforementioned Atishayas, but accept the rule of the Devadidev Veetrag, possessing the aforementioned characteristics. If you have consciousness (the power of knowledge to discern between right and wrong), then meditate on the deva possessing the aforementioned characteristics. In fact, the advice given to a conscious person is successful, while the advice given to a person devoid of consciousness (discriminating intellect) is futile. It is also said: "Crying in the forest, massaging a dead body, trying to straighten a dog's crooked tail, playing music for a deaf person, sowing lotus seeds in the ground, and rain falling on barren land - all these things become futile, just as the advice given to an ignorant person goes in vain." ||5||

**Now, the characteristics of Adev are described.**

## The Lack of Liberation by Ordinary Devas

**Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verses 6-7 (62)**

Those Devas who are tainted by the marks of attachment, such as women, weapons, prayer beads, etc., and who are engaged in giving curses and boons, their worship, etc., does not lead to liberation. ||6||

**Explanation:** Devas who adorn themselves with women, beautiful women, weapons like tridents, prayer beads, damaru (a small hand drum), etc., and who perform dances, destruction, laughter, or ostentatious displays, become worshipped by the people. But in truth, these women, weapons, prayer beads, etc., are all indicators of their attachment, aversion, and delusion. Women are the cause of attachment. If a Deva is truly detached, then what is the purpose of having a woman? Even ordinary humans in the world have women, and these Devas also have women, so what is the difference between the two? Weapons are a sign of aversion, they are kept out of fear of an enemy or opponent, or due to one's own weakness. Prayer beads are a sign of one's ignorance. Beads are used to remember a great person. Therefore, there must be a greater Deva than these so-called Devas. Those who are truly detached Devas, free from attachment and delusion, do not have women. Because they are free from aversion, they do not have prayer beads, which are a sign of forgetfulness or a symbol of great worship. Attachment, aversion, and delusion are the root of all vices. These three are the source of all vices. Being eager to punish through killing, binding, cursing, or striking, and to grant boons, etc., as a form of grace, are both caused by attachment and aversion. If even the supreme Devas are like this, then they cannot be the cause of liberation. In the world, even ghosts, spirits, and demons are considered to be Devas, and no one can stop them from believing in their own divinity. ||6||

This indicates the lack of the cause of liberation in those ordinary Devas. ||63||

How can those Devas who are unstable in their minds due to engaging in plays, laughter, music, etc., which increase attachment (delusion), grant liberation, the peaceful state, to the beings who have come to them for refuge? ||7||

**Explanation:** Here, liberation, free from all worldly entanglements, can only be understood through words like "perfect knowledge," etc. How can Devas who are unstable in their minds due to worldly titles like plays, laughter, music, etc., grant the peaceful state of liberation to their devotees who have come to them for refuge? A castor oil plant cannot be compared to a wish-fulfilling tree. Therefore, only the truly detached Deva, free from the vices of attachment, aversion, and delusion, can grant liberation; not other Devas who are tainted by many vices. For this, we present many useful verses (verse meanings) here:

"How can Rudra, Brahma, and Vishnu, who engage in wrong and inappropriate activities, be omniscient or detached, being inferior to ordinary people? Having a woman is a sign of lust, taking up weapons is a sign of aversion, prayer beads are a sign of ignorance, and a water pot is a sign of impurity. Rudra has Rudrani, Brihaspati has Tara, Brahma has Savitri, Pundarikaaksha has Padmalaya, Indra has Sachi, Surya has Rannadevi, Chandra has Rohini, the daughter of Daksha, Agni has Swaha, Kamadeva has Rati, and Yamadeva has Dhumoorna as their wives. Thus, it is clear that Devas have women, and each of them has weapons. And since each of them has worldly pleasures, there is doubt about their divinity. Therefore, it can be said without a doubt that they have not touched the state of the supreme Deva.

Even in the Sugata, who proclaims the world to be void due to ignorance, divinity does not arise. After the voidness is proven to be false, it is futile to speak of nihilism. And even if it is proven, without proof (when the proof itself becomes void), the voidness of the other side cannot be established. Then how can the voidness of one's own side be established? The Sugata believes in the momentariness of all things, then how can the doer be connected to the fruit of his action? How can the momentarist be the cause of the violence he commits? Similarly, how can the momentarist's memory recognize him or how can he behave? To give one's own body, filled with worms and other creatures, to a tiger; this is also a gift..." ||7||

## The Difference Between a Good Guru and a Bad Guru

**From the second light of Yoga Shastra, verses 6 to 9:**

How can a philosophy that advocates for the destruction of the womb and the consumption of flesh at birth be considered compassionate? How can a philosophy that considers the laws of nature meaningless and the soul (purusha) as devoid of qualities and inactive be considered wise? How can Kapil, who is mentally deranged by such a philosophy, be considered a god? How can the leaders of the gods, Skanda, Kartikeya, Vayu, and others, who are the source of all vices, be considered (supreme) gods?

Cows are animals, they often eat excrement, they frequently engage in sexual intercourse with their own offspring, and they kill living beings with their horns when the opportunity arises. How can they be considered worthy of worship? "They give milk," you say. If that is the reason for worshipping them, then why not worship buffaloes, which also give milk? There is no special difference between a cow and a buffalo. If you consider the cow to be the abode of every pilgrimage, sage, and god, then why do you milk them? Why do you kill them and sell them? And if you consider the pestle, mortar, stove, doorframe, peepal, neem, banyan, ak, and water, etc., as gods, then who has renounced them? If these things are considered divine, then their use should be abandoned altogether, and they should only be worshipped. For this reason, we have said in the Vitaragastotra: "We, who are satisfied with the gods who are manifested in the form of the belly and the genitals, are devotees of the gods. Those who have such a deluded mind, like you (Vitarag), speak ill of those who are devoid of divinity. This is truly a matter of sorrow." (Vitarag Stotra 6/8)

Now we will describe the characteristics of a good guru. 64. Those who are steadfast in the five great vows, who are patient in the face of adversity and hardship, who live on alms alone, who are steadfast in Samayika, and who teach pure Dharma are considered gurus. 8.

Meaning: Those who uphold the five great vows of non-violence, etc., who remain steadfast in their vows even in times of adversity or hardship, without succumbing to fear, are worthy of being gurus. Having established the fundamental qualities of a guru, we now describe the secondary qualities: "They live on alms alone," meaning that such gurus obtain only water and essential religious necessities from the giver householders in the form of alms. They do not possess wealth, grain, gold, silver, villages, or cities, etc., as possessions (attachment). Now we describe the qualities that are the cause of the guru possessing both fundamental and secondary qualities: "They are steadfast in Samayika." They remain stable in the practice of Samayika. Only by being established in Samayika can they be capable of upholding a character that is free from the duality of fundamental and secondary qualities. This is a common characteristic of all monks. Now we describe the extraordinary characteristic of a guru: "They teach Dharma." True gurus teach pure Dharma, which is in the form of the Dharma-sutra-charitra, free from the defilement of attachment, or the Dharma that is free from the duality of the relationship between the virtuous and the listener. For this reason, we have stated in the Abhidhanachintamani lexicon: "A guru is one who teaches Dharma." A guru who imparts the true (wonderful) meaning of the scriptures is called a guru. 8.

Now we will describe the characteristics of a bad guru. 65. Those who desire everything, who eat everything, who possess possessions, who are not celibate, and who teach falsehood are not gurus. 9.

Meaning: Those who desire everything, such as women, wealth, grain, gold, land, houses, and four-legged animals, in return for teaching, etc., who collect all kinds of things, necessary and unnecessary, and claim them as their own, who are omnivorous, eating anything they can find, such as meat, alcohol, intoxicants, rotten food, and endless food, who possess possessions such as land, property, women, and children, and who are not celibate due to these possessions, are not gurus. 1. How can a Jain monk who claims ownership of villages, devotees, and pilgrimages be considered a Jain monk?

## Dharma's Essence, Deciding Between Human and Non-Human Words

**Chapter Two, Light of Yoga, Verses 10-12**

Due to the aforementioned major flaws, they are declared as **abrahmachari** (one who delights in external pudgalas, **pudgalanandi**). Finally, an extraordinary reason for **agurutva** (lack of authority) is given: **"mithyopadesha"**. The teachings of an **aguru** (unworthy teacher) are not imbued with pure dharma; they are filled with words that promote violence, desire, falsehood, consumption of alcohol or intoxicants, etc. Such teachings lack the guidance of **aptpurushas** (worthy individuals), and therefore cannot be called **dharmopadeśa** (teachings of dharma). || 9 ||

Here arises the question: if their authority is established by giving **dharmopadeśa**, then what is the need to search for qualities like **niṣparigrahatva** (non-attachment) in them? In response to this, it is said:

**Verse 10:**

**"Parigrahaaram bhamagnastaryeyuḥ katham parān? | Svayam daridro na parameshwarikartumiśhwaraḥ ||"**

**Meaning:** How can one who is drowned in attachment and its beginnings save others? One who is poor himself, how can he make another wealthy? || 10 ||

**Explanation:** One who is immersed in the beginnings of attachment, like attachment to wife, children, wealth, grain, land, property, etc., leading to violence and other actions, who desires to possess all things and is an omnivore, is himself drowned in the ocean of samsara. How can he then be capable of rescuing others from the ocean of existence? This is explained through a simple analogy: "How can a poor man make another rich?" || 10 ||

Now, the characteristics of dharma are explained:

**Verse 11:**

**"Durgatiprapatpraanidharanaad dharmo uchyate | Samyamaadirdasavidhaḥ, sarvajnoktō vimuktaye ||"**

**Meaning:** Dharma is called so because it sustains and protects beings who are falling into **durgati** (hellish realms). It is of ten types, beginning with **samyama** (self-control), and is spoken by **sarvajnas** (omniscient beings) for the sake of liberation. || 11 ||

**Explanation:** **Naraka** (hell) and **tiryanch** (animal realms) are both **durgati**. Dharma is that which sustains and protects beings who are falling into **durgati**, i.e., it saves them from these realms. This is the meaning of the word **dharma** (etymologically), and this is its characteristic. Or, in another way, **dharma** is that which sustains and establishes beings in **sadgati** (good realms), **devagati** (heavenly realms), **manushya** (human realms), or **moksha** (liberation). The ancient teachers have also said: "This sustains beings who are falling into **durgati** and establishes them in auspicious realms, hence it is called **dharma**." This tenfold dharma, beginning with **samyama**, being spoken by **sarvajnas**, fulfills the purpose of liberation. We will discuss this further. Since other gods are not **sarvajnas**, their words cannot be considered authoritative.

Here, the opponent may raise this doubt: there are no words spoken by **sarvajnas**; because the **Vedas** are eternal and **apौरुषेय** (not created by humans), therefore their words are not spoken by any human. So, the truth should be decided based on the **Vedas** alone, or the essence of dharma should be known from them. What is the need for **sarvajnokt** (words of omniscient beings) or **tattvanirnaya** (determination of truth)? It is also said: "Through **nodana** (inspiration of the Vedas), every individual will be able to know the past, future, and present, the gross and subtle, the distant and near. The senses alone cannot know anything." (Shabara Bhashya 1.1-2) Since the **Vedas** are **apौरुषेय**, there is no possibility of any human-related flaw entering their inspiration (**nodana**). Therefore, they should be considered authoritative. In **Nyaya Shastra** (Logic) it is also said: "Words are subject to the speaker; the speaker is prone to flaws." When even a virtuous speaker can lack flawlessness at times, then there is certainly a possibility of flaws entering the words of a speaker who is devoid of virtues. Or, the doubt about whether a statement is flawed or not can only arise in the case of human words. Where the speaker is not a human, in the absence of a speaker, flaws cannot exist without a basis. (Mimamsa Sloka Varttika 1.1-2-62/63) Therefore, since the words of the **apौरुषेय** **Vedas** lack a creator, there is no possibility of any flaw whatsoever. || 11 ||

Addressing this doubt, it is said:

**Verse 12:**

**"Apौरुषेयं vachanam sambhavi bhaved yadi | Na pramanam bhaved vaachaam hyaptaadheenā pramanata ||"**

**Meaning:** If non-human words were possible, then they would not be authoritative. For the authority of words lies in the **aptas** (worthy individuals). || 12 ||

## The Harm of Believing in False Gods, Teachers, and Dharma

**Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verses 12-14:**

**Verse 12:** No word is possible without a speaker, it is considered impossible. Even if such a word exists, it is not proof. Because the authenticity of words depends on the true speaker, the wise person.

**Explanation:** A word spoken by a person is called a "paurusheya" word. What is spoken through the impact of the throat, palate, etc., and their causes, is called a word. Therefore, any word will be "paurusheya" - created by the effort of a person. An "apaurusheya" word is contradictory, like a flower in the sky (or a speck of dust in the sky), impossible, and cannot be proven by any evidence. Nor can it be called intangible and invisible. Because words are tangible, only a tangible and embodied being can speak them; not an incorporeal or intangible being. If you consider the sound of clapping hands as proof, then this statement is also not true. Because believing that sound originates from clapping or snapping fingers leads to the opposite fault of "apaurusheya". Even for a single word, the need for the throat, palate, etc., the instrument, and the impact is felt, then for other words like it, the need for the place, instrument, etc., will also be required. And then, even if the place, etc., are not visible in figurative words, how will their "apaurusheya" nature, expressing their implied meaning, be possible? If a lamp is lit in a householder's house to see yogurt and a pot, then it also reveals the bread, like the yogurt, etc. Therefore, by the aforementioned logic, the "apaurusheya" nature of a word is not proven. (Nyaya Man. p. 195) Even if we accept the word as "apaurusheya" like a flower in the sky, etc., based on the habit of unauthenticity, it will still not be considered proof. Because only words spoken by a wise person are considered proof; not other words. Since the quality in a word is created by the speaker, how can the quality be transferred (attributed) to the words of a flawed speaker? There is no recognition of such words; which have no speaker, or because of the absence of a speaker, the words cannot remain with qualities without a support.

And whether these words have qualities or not? This can also be determined only by "paurusheya" words. Since there is no human creator of the Vedic words, there is no doubt whether they have qualities or not.

**Verse 13:** Dharma, taught by those with false views, and contaminated by violence, etc., even if it is known as Dharma in the world, is the cause of worldly wandering.

**Explanation:** Dharma taught by those with opposing views (contaminated by extreme views), like Rudra, Daityari, Viranchi, Kapil, Sugata, etc., and accepted by simple-minded people, even if it is famous in the world, is still a cause of birth and death in the four realms of existence, and is therefore a form of "adharma". Why and how? In response, it is said that this Dharma is contaminated by violence, etc. And scriptures created by those with false views are often contaminated by violence, etc.

**Verse 14:** If a god is attached, a teacher is not celibate, and Dharma is devoid of compassion, then it is a great pity! It is because of these that the world is sinking.

**Explanation:** If a god is filled with attachment, hatred, and delusion, a teacher is not celibate and indulges in the five great sins, like killing, etc., and Dharma is devoid of compassion and lacks fundamental and secondary qualities, and is prevalent in the world, then we are deeply saddened! It is a pity that because of such gods, teachers, and Dharma, the path to hell is increasing, and the world is falling into the abyss of destruction. Someone has said - If the gods who are considered worthy of worship are themselves attached and hateful; or are nihilists, drinking alcohol, eating meat, and killing living beings is Dharma, and the so-called Dharma teachers are attached to worldly pleasures, intoxicated by lust, and

## Five Characteristics of Samyaktvam

**Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 15**

It is a great sorrow when those who are attached to worldly things are still considered worthy of respect. 1 For simple-minded people who are easily misled take refuge in them and continue on the path of downfall and destruction. 14.

Thus, the abandonment of *kudev*, *kuguru*, and *kudharma* and the realization of *sudev*, *suguru*, and *sudharma* are beautifully explained as *samyaktvam*. But from the perspective of *nishchayadristi*, *samyaktvam* is the pure result of a good soul; it is itself intangible, we cannot see it, but we can know it through its five signs. Therefore, now we describe these five signs.

71. *Sham*, *sanveg*, *nirved*, *anukampa*, and *astikya* are the five characteristics by which *samyaktvam* is well recognized. 15.

**Explanation:**

Even indirect *samyaktvam* residing in one's own soul or in the soul of another can be known through the five signs of *sham*, *sanveg*, *nirved*, *anukampa*, and *astikya* in external behavior. The nature of these five is as follows:

1. **Sham:** *Sham* means *prasham* or the non-arising of cruel, infinite *kṣayās*. It means restraining *kṣayās* from arising, either by their nature or by knowing and seeing the bitter fruits of their maturation. It is said that knowing the inauspicious results of *karma* (karma-phala), the practice of *upshamabhav* (state of calmness) in the soul, even not getting angry at the offender is *prasham*. Many *ācāryas* call the calming of the itch of anger and the thirst for worldly objects *sham*. The question arises: how can a being who has attained *samyagdarshan* and serves the *sadhus* have the itch of anger and the thirst for worldly objects? Then how can we consider Emperor Shrenik and Shri Krishna, who were seen to have worldly desires and the itch of anger, to have *sham* as described above? And if they did not have *sham*, how can we consider them to have *samyaktvam*? The solution is this: it is not that they lacked *sham* and therefore did not have *samyaktvam*. Just as there is fire covered with ash without smoke in a blacksmith's furnace. There is no smoke in that fire. In this regard, according to *nyāyashastra*, the rule (vyapti) is that wherever there is smoke, there is fire, because where there is a sign (ling), there is the signified (lingi), provided that the sign has been ascertained by examination. Therefore, it is said that where there is smoke - a sign (ling), there is definitely fire (lingi) with the sign. But where there is the signified with the sign (lingi), it is not necessary for the sign (ling) to be present. Just as sometimes fire with red embers is also without smoke; there is no rule for the presence of smoke as a sign (ling) in the signified (lingi). The relationship between the sign and the signified is in the reverse of the rule. From this perspective, both Shri Krishna and King Shrenik were definitely *samyaktvīs*, but the sign of *prasham* was sometimes present and sometimes not. Compared to the three rounds of infinite *kṣayās*, their *kṣayās* were *prasham*, but compared to the round of *sanjwalan* *kṣayās*, anger, etc., were not *prasham*. Therefore, in that respect, even though both of these great souls were *samyaktvīs*, they had the existence of *sanjwalan* anger, itch, and subtle worldly desires. It is also clear that sometimes *sanjwalan* *kṣayās* are also intense and have results similar to infinite *kṣayās*.

2. **Sanveg:** *Sanveg* means the desire for liberation. A being with *samyagdristi* considers the worldly pleasures of a king and Indra to be mixed with sorrow and therefore considers them to be sorrow. They consider the pleasure of liberation to be the only true pleasure. It is also said that a *samyaktvī* soul considers the pleasure of a human and Indra to be sorrow in their heart (antar) and does not pray for anything else without liberation with *sanveg*; (Shra. Pra. 56) that is the one who has *sanveg*.

3. **Nirved:**

Dispassion from the world is *nirved*. A soul with *samyagdristi* is deeply disgusted with sorrow and bad destiny, birth... 1. Even if there is such a muni in the garb of a Jain muni, they are also invisible.

## Five Marks of Right Faith (Samyaktv)

**Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 15**

In the prison of death, suffering various tortures inflicted by the shackles of karma (dandapashak), unable to resist them, accepting the feeling of ruthlessness, he is overwhelmed with sorrow. It is said:

"Without practicing in the afterlife in the realms of hell, animal, human, and god, devoid of the poison of attachment, he experiences sorrow with detachment (vairagya) without the Vedas."

Many Acharyas have interpreted the meaning of "sanveg" and "nirved" in the opposite sense - "sanveg" meaning detachment from the world and "nirved" meaning the desire for liberation.

**4. Compassion (Anukampa)**

The desire to have mercy on suffering beings is compassion. True compassion is the feeling of wanting to alleviate the suffering of the distressed without any partiality. Even tigers, lions, etc., have compassion for their children, but that is partial compassion. Compassion is of two types: material and emotional. Material compassion is to alleviate the suffering of the distressed person by counteracting their suffering to the best of one's ability. Emotional compassion is to have a tender heart towards the distressed and be filled with mercy. It is said:

"Seeing beings experiencing suffering in the ocean of the world, to connect them to righteous conduct with material and emotional compassion without partiality, according to one's ability, is truly to eradicate their suffering." (Shra. Pra. 59)

**5. Faith (Astikya)**

The soul is real, and the realms of heaven, hell, and the afterlife are the fruits received by the soul according to its good and bad tendencies. Karma is the cause of the diversity of beings in the world, and there is karma-phala (fruit of karma). One who believes this is a believer (astik). His feeling (guna) or action (karma) is astikya. Even after hearing and knowing the nature of other religious principles, one who never desires to accept another religious principle while abandoning the Jain principles, and whose firm faith is in the Jain principles, is the true believer. Such a believer can be identified by his faith even when the dharma and samyaktv are not directly visible (indirectly). For such a believer with the mark of astikya, it is said:

"What the Jineshwars have said is true and without doubt. Such a person, endowed with auspicious results and free from doubts, desires, and other vices, is considered a samyaktvī."

Some Acharyas have explained the marks (lingas) of samyaktv, such as "sham," etc., in a different way. According to them, "sham" means to calm (upasham) the false belief (mithyabhinivesh) by holding fast to the principles of the Agamas composed by the well-examined speakers (aps). This is the first mark of right faith (samyagdarshan). In short, one who abandons the untruth and accepts the truth (satya) is a samyagdarshi. "Sanveg" means to practice righteous conduct according to the teachings of the Jinas and to have faith in them, out of fear of birth and death and suffering in the realms of hell, etc. A samyagdarshi soul with sanveg contemplates the physical and mental torments, the cold, heat, and other pains experienced in hell, the torment caused by the interaction with the wicked and demonic beings of that realm who remind them of their past enmity, the suffering of being subservient to others in the animal realm, being beaten with wood, whips, etc., the poverty, misfortune, disease, and anxieties in the human realm, and fears them, and thus practices righteous conduct to prevent them and attain peace from those sufferings. Only then is the mark of sanveg visible. Alternatively, the increasing enthusiasm (vega) in samyagdarshan - its growth - is the mark of sanveg in samyaktv. "Nirved" means the feeling of non-attachment to objects. For example, a nirvedavan soul thinks: "The attachment of beings to worldly pleasures, which are difficult to attain in this world, will bear many troublesome fruits in this life and will also bear the extremely bitter fruits of hell, animal, and human births in the afterlife. Therefore, what is the benefit of such pleasures? They must be abandoned." Thus, the samyagdarshan of the soul can also be identified by detachment (vairagya). "Anukampa" means to feel a vibration in the heart in accordance with the suffering of another when one sees it. Its action is in the form of mercy. Anukampavan thinks: "The world...

## Five Ornaments of Right Faith

**Chapter 2, Light of Yoga, Verse 16**

All beings desire happiness and flee from suffering. Therefore, I should not cause pain to anyone. Just as they experience suffering, so do I. This kind of compassion, characterized by empathy, identifies a person with Right Faith. Similarly, the scriptures of the Jinas teach about the transcendental (beyond the senses) objects - the soul, karma, karmic fruits, the afterlife, merit, demerit, etc. If one believes in these, it can be understood that they have faith in the soul. This faith also identifies a person with Right Faith.

**Verse 15**

Thus, the aforementioned five signs can be used to determine if a soul possesses Right Faith.

Now, we will describe the five ornaments of Right Faith.

**Verse 16**

**Steadfastness, propagation, devotion, skill in the teachings of the Jinas, and service to the Tirthankaras - these five are said to be the ornaments of Right Faith.**

**Explanation:**

The ornaments of Right Faith are those qualities that enhance its beauty. These five ornaments enhance the beauty of the teachings of the Jinas (the Dharma Sangha).

1. **Steadfastness in the teachings of the Jinas (Dharma Sangha):** If someone's mind is wavering from the Dharma due to adversity, doubt, or other reasons, or if someone is falling away from the Dharma or becoming corrupt, then to stabilize them by explaining and advising them, or to inspire them to remain steadfast in the Dharma, or to not be swayed by the prosperity, pomp, or miracles of other sects (views) and remain steadfast in the teachings of the Jinas - this is steadfastness.

2. **Propagation of the Dharma (teachings):** To influence those who have not attained the teachings of the Jinas by various means of propagation and dissemination. There are eight types of propagators: preachers, storytellers, debaters, occasion-based propagators, ascetics, scholars, those who have attained Siddhi (perfection), and poets. (Vy. Bha.)

    * **Preacher:** One who influences people with the profound knowledge of the twelve-fold scriptures or the Ganipitakas, using a style that is relevant to the times, and inspires a strong desire for knowledge of the scriptures in people. They inspire people to live a life of Dharma through their eloquent sermons. This is a preacher.

    * **Storyteller:** One who has the ability to deliver beautiful Dharma teachings using various techniques, illustrations, etc., and who influences people with Dharma stories and imparts Dharma knowledge. This is a storyteller.

    * **Debater:** One who is capable of defending their own position and refuting the arguments of the opposing side in a four-fold assembly of debaters, respondents, audience, and moderator. They influence people with their debating skills. This is a debater.

    * **Occasion-based propagator:** One who is knowledgeable about the benefits and drawbacks of the past, present, and future, and who is a master of the science of auspicious occasions. They influence people by using their knowledge to impart Dharma knowledge related to their past, present, and future lives, and inspire them to practice Dharma. This is an occasion-based propagator.

    * **Ascetic:** One who practices various rigorous austerities like the Atthama, etc., and influences people by demonstrating the power of the soul and inspiring them to purify themselves through austerity and manifest the power of the soul. This is an ascetic.

    * **Scholar:** One who uses their knowledge of the scriptures to influence people and inspire them to practice Dharma. This is a scholar.

    * **One who has attained Siddhi (perfection):** One who has attained perfection and influences people by their example. This is one who has attained Siddhi.

    * **Poet:** One who uses poetry to influence people and inspire them to practice Dharma. This is a poet.

    * **Note:** One who uses auspicious occasions and mantras for self-promotion is not a Dharma propagator but a Dharma destroyer.

##  The Five Ornaments of Right Faith (Samyaktv)

**1.  Non-Violence (Ahimsa)** -  The first ornament of right faith is non-violence. It is the foundation of Jainism and encompasses refraining from harming any living being, both physically and mentally.

**2.  Influence (Prabhavana)** -  The second ornament is influence, which manifests in various ways:

* **Knowledge Influencer (Vidya Prabhavaka)** -  One who has mastered various knowledge disciplines like Prajnapti, Rohini, etc., and uses this knowledge to guide others. They use their wisdom to overcome obstacles, hardships, and calamities faced by the community.
* **Power Influencer (Siddhi Prabhavaka)** -  One who possesses various powers like Vaikriya, Anima, etc., and uses them for the benefit of the community. They employ techniques like Anjan, Padalepa, etc., for the welfare of the Sangha.
* **Poetry Influencer (Kavya Prabhavaka)** -  One who creates literary works like prose, poetry, etc., to inspire people towards righteous conduct and strengthen their faith. They use their writing to influence the community towards Dharma.

These eight types of influencers contribute to the spread of Jainism according to their abilities and the circumstances of time and place. Therefore, influence is considered the second ornament of right faith.

**3.  Devotion (Bhakti)** -  The third ornament is devotion, which involves serving the Sangha (community) with humility and respect. The Sangha consists of four types: Sadhus, Sadhvis, Shravakas, and Shravikas. The primary members are Sadhus and Sadhvis.

Devotion manifests in various ways:

* **Respecting Elders** -  Standing up to greet those who are more knowledgeable and virtuous, welcoming them with folded hands, offering them a seat, and accepting their seat before taking one's own.
* **Honoring and Worshipping** -  Showing respect and reverence to those who are more virtuous.
* **Following Behind** -  Walking behind those who are more virtuous.

These eight forms of respectful behavior constitute devotion, which helps to eliminate the eight karmas.

* **Serving the Sangha** -  Serving the members of the Sangha, including Acharyas, Upadhyayas, Tapasvis, newly initiated Sadhus, the sick, the family, the virtuous, the Sangha, the knowledgeable, etc.
* **Providing Support** -  Providing food, water, clothes, utensils, shelter, bedding, cushions, and seats to those who deserve it.
* **Caring for the Sick** -  Providing medical care and assistance to the sick.
* **Helping in Difficult Situations** -  Assisting those who are facing difficulties.
* **Removing Obstacles** -  Removing obstacles and hardships faced by the Sangha.

All these acts of service constitute devotion, which enhances the beauty of the Sangha. Therefore, devotion is considered the third ornament of right faith.

**4.  Skill in Jainism (Kushalata)** -  The fourth ornament is skill in Jainism, which involves understanding the principles of Dharma and resolving the doubts and problems faced by the followers. This skill helps to keep people grounded in the Sangha and motivates them to serve the community.

**5.  Service to the Tirtha (Tirthaseva)** -  The fifth ornament is service to the Tirtha, which is like a landing place on the shore of the ocean of life. It helps us to cross the ocean of Samsara (cycle of birth and death) safely. There are two types of Tirthas:

* **Dravya Tirtha** -  A place where a Tirthankara was born, initiated, attained Kevala Jnana (omniscience), and attained Nirvana. These places are considered sacred and are visited by devotees.
* **Bhava Tirtha** -  The Sangha itself, consisting of Sadhus, Sadhvis, Shravakas, and Shravikas.

The service to the Tirtha involves serving the Sangha in the ways mentioned earlier. This service adds to the beauty of right faith.

These five ornaments of right faith are essential for spiritual progress and liberation. They guide us towards a life of non-violence, compassion, and devotion, leading us closer to the ultimate goal of Moksha (liberation).

## Five Defilements of Rightness

**Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 17, 73**

Doubt, desire, uncertainty, praise of false views, and close association with them - these five completely defile rightness.

**Explanation:**

Doubt, desire, uncertainty, praise of false views, and close association with them are called defilements because they greatly corrupt pure rightness. Here is a description of each:

**Doubt:**

Doubt is to question. Doubt can be universal (regarding everything) or specific (regarding a particular aspect). Universal doubt is like, "I don't know if this is the right religion or not?" Specific doubt is related to a particular aspect of religion, like, "This being exists, but is it omnipresent or not? Is it localized or not?" Both types of doubt, being a form of disbelief in the teachings of the liberated ones, defile rightness, creating impurities, blemishes, or deep flaws.

Presenting a doubt to someone in the form of an inquiry is not a fault, but doubting with a desire to win or out of disbelief is a fault. If doubt arises due to delusion, one should hold onto it like a burning ember with faith and humility, and reveal it to knowledgeable and noble individuals when appropriate.

If one cannot understand a profound subject due to their weak intellect, or due to not finding teachers who can explain it, or due to the rise of their knowledge-obscuring karma, or because the subject is too deep to understand, or because examples are not available, then a wise and faithful person should think: "The liberated, omniscient Lord speaks the truth. They are free from any desire for reward, selfless and dedicated to the welfare of others, the greatest renunciants in the world, conquerors of attachment, aversion, and delusion. They never speak falsely." (Dhyan Shatak 47-48-49) Therefore, it is not appropriate to doubt the words of such a trustworthy person. Their words are absolutely true, but I cannot understand them due to my limited intellect or ignorance. I should accept this truth with patience and faith. We ordinary people cannot test the truth of things that can be known through the scriptures. Therefore, we should not be skeptical of the truth revealed in the scriptures. Skepticism leads to false views. Therefore, the scriptures spoken by the Jinas are our proof.

**Desire:**

Desire is to accept a view due to someone's showmanship or allure. This is also of two types: universal and specific. Universal desire is to desire all views or religious communities. Specific desire is to desire a particular view, sect, or community. For example, "Someone might say that the Sugata taught a religion free from hardship for monks. There, monks have bathing, delicious food, drinks, and fine clothes, and there is a provision for soft, comfortable beds. They have made the path of religion easy by providing all kinds of comforts. Their scriptures say, 'Sleeping on a soft bed, drinking sweet beverages upon waking, eating delicious food at noon, drinking again in the evening, and eating grapes and sugar at midnight - these are the results that led Shakyasingha to liberation.' This is appealing to the common people, so they quickly lean towards it. The Parivajakas, Bhauts, Brahmanas, etc., say in their teachings, 'Those who enjoy sensual pleasures in this life will enjoy pleasures in the afterlife.' Therefore, one should also try practicing this view." This kind of desire, being the source of disbelief in the scriptures revealed by the liberated Lord, defiles rightness.

**Uncertainty:**

Uncertainty is to doubt the fruits of religious practice. Due to the instability of the mind, one might think, "The great austerities, right conduct, right faith, or right knowledge described in the scriptures are very harsh, tasteless like a grain of sand, and dull. I don't know if I will get the fruits of all this great hardship. Oh! This austerity is very..."

## The Nature of Anuvratas

The second light of Yoga Shastra, verses 17 and 18, seem to be devoid of any benefit and only cause distress! Just as a farmer, even without the certainty of rain during the monsoon season, still toils in the field, so too does the arduous labor undertaken for this austerity and the like seem futile and successful. It is also said, "The practitioners of the past were on the right path, so they could receive the appropriate fruits, but how can we, who are of this degenerate age and devoid of intellect and concentration, attain such fruits?" This kind of doubt is different, doubt always relates to the substance-quality relationship of the whole and the part, while doubt is also a defect of rightness, being a form of disbelief in the words of the Lord. Doubt and doubt are related to the fruit of action. Or, this is also the meaning of doubt - to criticize the conduct of virtuous monks. For example, why do these monks remain so foul-smelling and dirty due to sweat on their bodies, why don't they bathe properly? What harm is there in bathing with impure water? Thus, being a form of disbelief in the religion spoken by the Lord, it is essentially a defect of rightness.

**Praise of False Views** - Praising those with opposite views - false views - is praise of false views. This is also of two types, local and universal. Universal praise, for example, someone might say, "The views of Kapil and others are all reasonable." This kind of praise, which is based on a middle ground, is a corruption of rightness. We have said in praise, "O Lord! It is absolutely certain that those who are supremely selfish do not consider your form to be superior to their own form. They have become examiners by accepting the middle ground, they cannot see the difference between a piece of glass and a gem." (Ayog 27) Local praise, for example, "This is the true word of the Sugata, or the word of the Sankhya, or the word of Kanada." This is clearly a defect of rightness.

**Close Acquaintance with False Views** - To live in the same place with such false view holders, to increase interaction with them through mutual conversation and other activities, and to become overly familiar with them. Living together in one place or coming into contact with them repeatedly, hearing and seeing their practices, can lead to a weakening of the vision of firm rightness; then, what to say about the minds of the newly arrived, those of weak intellect who accept the religion, being affected by this? From this perspective, close acquaintance with false views has been described as a corruption of rightness. - Therefore, it is essential that whoever has obtained the specific substance-field-time-state form of rightness material, should receive rightness from the Gurudev in a proper manner in order to sustain it and follow it truly. It is also said, "The possibility of fault | In such a situation, the Shraman Upasaka should re-embrace rightness in terms of substance and state, with a view to withdrawing from falsehood. After that, he should not perform actions like offering, worship, and puja in the temples of the supreme deities, nor should he, carried away by the flow of the world, perform rituals like bathing, charity, Pindadaan, Yajna, Vrata, Tapas, Sankranti, lunar eclipse, solar eclipse, etc. in worldly pilgrimages (with a reverent mind). [Mula Shuddhi Pr. 4-5]

When some small amount of the ocean-like quota-koti state of the false-view-delusive karma remains, the being attains rightness. And when he completes the state of two to nine palya-like units from the remaining state, he attains the state of Deshvirati Shravak Guna. It is also said, "After attaining rightness, the Vrata-dhari Shravak becomes a Shravak when he completes the state of two to nine palya-like units in the separate state, i.e., as mentioned above." ||17||

We had previously said, "The five Anuvratas are the foundation of rightness. After explaining the nature of rightness in detail, we now explain the nature of the Anuvratas."
174. Viratim sthula hinsade dvividh-trividhadi na | Ahimsadi ni panchanuvratani jagadurjina: ||18|| Meaning: Shri Jinendradev has called abstinence from gross violence, etc., in the form of two-fold, three-fold, etc., i.e., six types, etc., as the five Anuvratas of non-violence, etc. ||18|| Explanation: Among those with false views or gross views, the violence that is well-known is called gross violence or violence against the sentient beings. The word sthula (gross) also implies, by implication, the meaning of intentional violence against innocent sentient beings.

## The Nature of Anuvrat

This is verse 18 from the second chapter of the Yoga Shastra. The word "adi" (etc.) includes gross lying, gross stealing, gross adultery, and gross non-possession. Grossly abandoning violence, etc., or abstaining from them is the five Anuvratas, which are popularly known as non-violence, truth, non-stealing, celibacy, and non-possession. These five Anuvratas were established by the Tirthankaras.

The question arises: why did the Tirthankaras not explain these for all (generally) Shramanopasakas (lay followers)? Why did they explain them only in the two-fold and three-fold forms? In response, it is said: since a householder lives with his family, and he also has to accept possessions like wealth and grain, if someone in the family commits violence, possession, etc., then the approval-sanction of the said householder who is observing the vow is implied. From this perspective, he incurs the guilt of sanction. Otherwise, if there were no difference between a possessor and a non-possessor, then the distinction between a Dikshita (Shraman) and an Adikshita (Shramanopasaka) would cease to exist. Therefore, the abandonment of violence, etc., in the two-fold and three-fold forms is the general rule for the Shravaka (lay follower).

This means: two-fold means to do and to cause to do, three-fold means three yogas - mind, speech, and body. This means that I will not commit gross violence with my mind, speech, and body, nor will I cause it to be done. The third aspect, sanction, is open.

Here, there is a doubt: in the Bhagavati Sutra and other Agamas, it is prescribed for the Shravaka to reject (pratyakhyan) in the three-fold form (three aspects with three yogas). Since it is established in the scriptures, it is undoubtedly (blameless), then why is it not mentioned here? In response, it is said: this is prescribed for the Shravaka only in a specific situation; for example, if a Shravaka desires to take Muni Diksha (monkhood), but he remains with possessions to support his family, or if a Shravaka rejects gross violence, etc., of fish, etc., in the oceans like the Svayambhuraman, etc., in a specific situation, he rejects in the aforementioned two-fold and three-fold forms. In their context, such a rule is given in the Bhagavati Sutra, etc. And the word "adi" (etc.) is used after the words "two-fold" and "three-fold" here with the intention of including it. However, such devoted Shravakas are very rare. Therefore, we have not mentioned it here. Generally, rejection in the two-fold and three-fold forms is prescribed for the Shravaka.

In the second part of the verse, the word "adi" (etc.) is added after "two-fold," therefore, the alternatives (bhang) to the two-fold and three-fold forms are as follows:

**Two-fold - Two-fold:** Not to commit gross violence, nor to cause it to be done; with mind and speech; or with mind and body, or with speech and body. This is the second type. When one rejects doing and causing to do with mind and speech, then it means not giving consent with the mind, and also not speaking about violence with speech; and with the body, one acts like an unconscious person. Not to commit violence, nor to cause it to be done with mind and body means that one does not have the intention of violence in the mind, and also abandons the tendency of violence with the body. But in the state of unawareness (ignorance), one sometimes commits violence with speech. The meaning of abandoning doing and causing to do with speech and body is clear, but when abandoning through this type of bhang, one does not abandon doing and causing to do with the intention of the mind. The abandonment of sanction is not present in any of the three. In this way, one should also consider other alternatives.

**Two-fold - One-fold:** To abandon doing and causing to do only with the mind, or only with speech, or only with the body. This is the third type.

**One-fold - Three-fold:** To abandon doing or causing to do violence, etc., with the mind, speech, and body. This is the fourth type.

**One-fold - Two-fold:** To abandon doing or causing to do violence, etc., with the mind and speech, or with the mind and body, or with speech and body. This is the fifth alternative.

**One-fold - One-fold:** To abandon doing or causing to do violence, etc., only with the mind, or only with speech, or only with the body. This is the sixth type. [A. Ni. 1558-59]

This can be summarized in one verse: The first distinction is two-fold and three-fold, the second distinction is two-fold and two-fold, the third distinction is two-fold and one-fold, the fourth distinction is one-fold and three-fold, the fifth distinction is one-fold and two-fold, and the sixth distinction is one-fold and one-fold.

## The Fruits of Violence

**Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 19**

If we calculate all these alternatives (bhang) with three karans and three yogas, then there are a total of 49 types. They are as follows:

**1. With respect to not doing violence (krit), there are 7 alternatives:**

1. By mind, speech, and body.
2. By mind and speech.
3. By mind and body.
4. By speech and body.
5. By mind only.
6. By speech only.
7. By body only.

**2. Similarly, with respect to not causing violence (karit), there are 7 alternatives.**

**3. And with respect to approval, there are also seven alternatives.**

**4. Do not commit violence, do not cause violence, by mind, by speech, by body, by mind and speech, by mind and body, by speech and body, by mind, speech, and body. These are the seven bhangs caused by karan and karana.**

**5. Similarly, there are seven bhangs from the approval of karan.**

**6. Seven bhangs from the approval of karana (karit).**

**7. And seven bhangs from doing, causing, and approving.**

**All these together make 49 alternative bhangs. And since these are trikala-vishayak, there are a total of 147 bhangs of pratyakhyan.**

The scriptures say: "He who has mastered the 147 alternatives (bhang) of pratyakhyan (pacchakkhan) is considered skilled in pratyakhyan. One who has mastered fewer bhangs is considered unskilled in pratyakhyan in all bhangs."

**Trikala-vishayak is as follows:**

* Condemning the sins committed in the past.
* Correcting (stopping) the sins of the present.
* Rejecting the sins of the future.

It is also said: "The Shraman Upasak regrets the sins of the past, restrains the sins of the present, and rejects the sins of the future."

**These bhangs (alternatives) are said with respect to the ahimsa anuvrata. Similarly, understand the net of alternatives (bhang) for other anuvratas.**

**Verse 18**

In this way, having explained the general form of restraint related to violence, etc., now, with the desire to explain the nature of each of violence, etc., first, it is explained what consequences one has to experience from violence.

**Verse 19**

**75. Seeing the fruit of violence, such as lameness, leprosy, and deformity, the wise man should abandon the intentional violence of innocent, trembling beings.**

**Meaning:** The fruit of violence is lameness, leprosy, deformity of limbs, etc. Seeing this, the wise man should abandon the intentional violence of innocent, trembling beings.

**Explanation:** Until a being sees the fruit of sin with his own eyes, he does not usually abandon it. Therefore, here, the fruit of sin is explained, and advice is given to refrain from violence. One who is unable to walk even though he has legs is called lame, one who has leprosy is called a leper, one who is without limbs is called crippled. The word "adi" means that the lower part of the body is damaged or other limbs are affected by various diseases, or there is a deformity in the upper part of the body. All these should be understood as the fruit of violence. Seeing this, the wise man, knowing for sure from the scriptures that this poor creature is experiencing the fruit of violence, therefore, I now abandon violence. Whose abandonment and what kind of abandonment? In response to this, it is explained that one should make a rule not to intentionally [without any reason] commit violence against innocent, two-sense, etc., beings. Such a rule is not explained for criminal beings. By saying "abandonment of violence against trembling beings," it is indicated here that a householder is unable to abandon violence against one-sense beings, and "sankalpata" is said because he should abandon violence with intention. The violence that happens unintentionally due to the initial tendency of farming, etc., is not forbidden for a Shravak. This means that one should abandon intentional violence against trembling beings. One should abandon violence against one-sense stationary beings as much as possible, and where abandonment is impossible, one should always strive. In this regard, some verses are presented. Their meaning is as follows:

Those who consider the soul and body to be completely separate, according to their opinion, even if the body is destroyed, the soul is not destroyed, and the violence caused by it does not apply. Similarly, if the soul and body are considered to be completely inseparable, then when the body is destroyed, the soul is also destroyed. Therefore, in their view, there is no existence of the afterlife. Therefore, from the perspective of anekanta-drishti, the soul is considered both different from and inseparable from the body. From this perspective, if the body is harmed or destroyed,

## The Fruits of Violence

The pain experienced by the body-bearer is the same pain that the killer experiences. Therefore, a wise person should diligently avoid violence that causes suffering to the dying being, distress to their mind, forces them to be reborn in a new womb, and destroys their previous existence. Those who carelessly destroy other beings are called by the wise as the seed of the world-tree of violence. Whether the being dies or not, the careless person will inevitably experience violence. However, if a being's life is lost due to the actions of a person who is free from carelessness, then no violence is incurred.

The question arises: If the being (soul) is eternal and unchanging, how can there be violence against it? And if it is considered completely transient (completely impermanent), how can violence be incurred by its destruction in a moment? Because according to their view, the being that was killed by the killer was already transient, and it was destroyed in that moment. The one whose life was taken is no longer there. Therefore, by considering the being as both eternal and transient, and by considering the pain caused by the separation of any life from the body, the violence that is the cause of sin is incurred.

Some argue that animals like tigers, lions, and snakes that kill other creatures should be killed on sight, as killing one such violent creature will protect many others. This argument is also misleading. If we accept the view that "all beings live by destroying others," then everyone will start killing others to survive. The proverb "might is right" will become a reality. Even if there is a small gain, there is a clear loss of the principal. How can the virtue that comes from non-violence be achieved through violence? How can a lotus born in water be born in fire? How can violence, the cause of sin, become the destroyer of sin? The poison of time, which is the cause of death, can never be a giver of life.

There is a skeptical view called "Dukhamochana" (Pain-Remover). It states that many people in the world are suffering from various ailments. It is desirable to kill these suffering people because their suffering will surely end by eliminating them; they will be freed from their suffering. This statement is also not true. Because such beings often become hell-bound after death. Those who suffer little in this life become recipients of infinite suffering by dying. Similarly, there is another view that believes that killing happy beings will prevent them from committing sins. Such statements by the wicked are also to be rejected.

The skeptic named Charvaka also says, "The soul is not proven in any way, so who is the victim of violence without a soul? And who will experience the fruits of that violence? Just as fermented liquor is prepared from rotten flour, etc., so too consciousness manifests from the coming together of the five elements, and it is destroyed when the group of five elements is destroyed. Then they also say that when the soul ends here, there is no question of its going to the afterlife. And in the absence of an afterlife, it is pointless to talk about virtue and sin. Therefore, performing various austerities is just a wonderful way to suffer. Restraint is like being deprived of the pleasures that are available. In this way, they spread such skeptical ideas to others.

Therefore, they are refuted by giving a logical answer to their arguments. "I am happy, I am unhappy," this kind of perception cannot be in the body, senses, or mind; it can only be in the soul. From this perspective, the soul is proven. "I know the pot." In this sentence, there is knowledge of three things: action, activity, and the doer. How can the doer be denied in these three? If the body is considered the doer, that is also not correct, because an inanimate object cannot be a doer. If the conscious being produced by the combination of the five elements and consciousness is considered the doer, that is also not consistent, because the absence of a single doer in such a conscious being makes statements like "I saw, I heard, I touched, I smelled, I tasted, or I remembered" impossible if the five elements and consciousness are considered inseparable. Just as consciousness is proven in one's own body through self-experience, so too is the soul proven in the bodies of others.

##  Refutation of Dukkhamochkatā and Cārvāka Philosophy

**Yogaśāstra, Second Light, Verses 20-22**

It can be inferred from reasoning. And by observing the actions that occur intelligently in one's own body, one should know the same in the bodies of others. Who can stop an action that is proven by evidence? Therefore, when the transmigration of the soul is also proven, then believing in the afterlife is not incongruous. In the same way, the acceptance of merit and demerit happens naturally. To call austerity a hardship, etc., is the statement of an unwise person, like the ravings of a madman. Why would it not be ridiculous to call the statement of such a conscious person self-created? Therefore, the soul is free from obstacles and stable, it is the nature of production and destruction, and it is the knower, the seer, the virtuous, the enjoyer, the doer, and the evidence of its own body. In this way, after the realization of the soul, it is not appropriate to commit violence. The avoidance of violence is called the vow of non-violence, which is the form of renunciation. || 19 || Now, to explain the rule of non-violence clearly, an example is given.

**Meaning**

|| 76 ||  **Ātmavat sarvabhūteṣu sukhaduḥkhe priyāpriye | Cintayan nātmano'niṣṭām hiṁsāmanyasya nācaret || 20 ||**

Just as one finds happiness pleasant and suffering unpleasant, so too, all beings find happiness pleasant and suffering unpleasant. Considering this, one should not commit violence, which is undesirable for oneself, towards others. || 20 ||

**Explanation:** Here, the word "happiness" should be understood to include the means of happiness such as food, water, garlands of flowers, sandalwood, etc., and the word "suffering" should be understood to include the means of suffering such as killing, binding, death, etc. The means of suffering are unpleasant for others just as they are for oneself; therefore, one should not engage in violence, etc. (actions that cause suffering). Here, happiness and suffering are explained as similar experiences through an example: just as one finds the means of happiness pleasant and suffering unpleasant, so too, all other types of beings find these things pleasant and unpleasant. Other scriptures also confirm this: "Listen to the essence of Dharma and hold it in your mind truthfully. Then, do not do to others what is contrary to your own soul." || 20 ||

Here, a doubt is raised: "If one commits an act forbidden by scripture, then one incurs blame. But here, the killing of living beings is forbidden, but the killing of stationary beings is not forbidden. Therefore, if a householder Śrāvaka willingly engages in the killing of stationary beings in any way, is there any blame?" To this, the following is the solution:

|| 77 || **Nirarthikām na kurvīt, jīveṣu sthāvareṣvapi | Hiṁsāhiṁsādharmājñaḥ, kāṅkṣan mokṣamupāsakaḥ || 21 ||**

A seeker of liberation (mumukṣu), a Śramaṇa devotee who knows the Dharma of non-violence, should not commit pointless violence even towards stationary beings. || 21 ||

**Meaning:**

**Explanation:** One should not commit pointless violence even towards beings (stationary beings) of earth, water, fire, air, and plants. Here, unnecessary violence for the sake of one's body and family is forbidden. In reality, a wise Śrāvaka does not commit pointless violence beyond the purpose of his body and family, etc. One who knows the Dharma of non-violence knows very well that the Dharma of non-violence is not limited to forbidden things; rather, there is also the Dharma of non-violence in the form of effort in things that are not forbidden. Therefore, understanding this Dharma well, he does not commit pointless violence even towards stationary beings without purpose. Therefore, to the doubt raised that why should a Śrāvaka act with such meticulous care regarding forbidden non-violence, it is said: a seeker of liberation, like a virtuous Śrāvaka, should never commit pointless violence. Here, another doubt is raised: "A person who is constantly eager to commit violence, even if he gives up all his wealth and even his life, still purifies himself from the sin of that violence. Then, what is the benefit of the suffering of giving up such violence?" || 21 ||

In response to this, it is said:

|| 78 || **Prāṇī prāṇitalobhena, yo rājyamapi muñcati | Tadvadhotthamagham sarvūrvidāne'pi na śāmyati || 22 ||**

This being, out of greed for life, even gives up his kingdom. The sin of violence arising from the killing of that being cannot be pacified (relieved from sin) even by giving away the entire earth. || 22 ||

## Violent and Condemnable

**Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verses 23-26**

**Explanation:** Even if a dying being is offered mountains of gold or kingdoms, it will not accept them, considering them undesirable. It only desires to live. Therefore, the sin of violence arising from killing beings who cherish life cannot be atoned for even by donating the entire earth. The scriptures also say, "Among all donations, the donation of safety is the most important." (22)

How condemnable is the life of those who commit violence? This is explained in the next four verses.

**Verse 23:**

**Meaning:** In the forest, what is the difference between a man who kills deer for meat and a dog, when both are consuming air, water, and grass?

**Explanation:** Can creatures living in the forest, not on land owned by anyone, ever be criminals? Therefore, it is said that these forest-dwelling deer are free from crimes like stealing wealth, breaking into others' homes, killing, and looting. There are further reasons for their innocence: they consume air, water, and grass. Since these three things do not belong to anyone else, those who consume them are not criminals. The term "meat-seeker" here should be understood as "greedy for deer meat" in the context. The word "deer" should be taken to include all creatures that roam the forest, eating grass and other vegetation. In this way, how can a man who is eager to kill innocent deer be considered any less than a dog that is greedy for meat? In other words, he should be considered even worse than a dog. (23)

**Verse 24:**

**Meaning:** If even a small thorn pricks any part of his body, a man is distressed. How then can he kill innocent creatures with sharp weapons? Why doesn't he consider the pain he would experience himself at that time?

**Explanation:** Indeed, one who does not recognize the suffering of others as equal to his own suffering is considered condemnable in the world. Those warriors who are addicted to hunting animals have been clearly told, "Your valor in violence will lead you to hell." How unjust is it for one who is stronger to kill the helpless, innocent, and extremely weak? What kind of immorality is this? What injustice is this against innocent beings? It is a great pity that the whole world has become lawless.

**Verse 25:**

**Meaning:** Those who commit cruel deeds, seeking only momentary satisfaction for themselves, destroy all the births of the embodied being.

**Explanation:** Those who commit violent acts like hunting, etc., for the momentary satisfaction of their tongue, for the sake of a little desire of the tongue, end the births of other beings. This means that their momentary satisfaction from the meat of other beings ends the entire life of that other being. This is a great cruelty. The Smriti-kar also says, "Consider the difference between the creature whose flesh the cruel man eats and that cruel man. One is satisfied for a moment, while the other is completely deprived of life." (25)

**Verse 26:**

**Meaning:** Even just saying "Die!" makes a being sorrowful. How much pain does a creature experience when it is being killed with terrible weapons?

**Explanation:** Not only by killing, but even by simply saying "Die!", a being experiences suffering like death.

Jain Terms Preserved:

The Yogashastra, Second Illumination, Verse 27, indicates that as a result of violence, the Chakravartis Subhuma and Brahmadatta went to the seventh hell. This is an established fact for all living beings; then how much suffering must that poor being have experienced when struck by spears, arrows, etc.? Truly, it suffers greatly. Where even the mention of death causes sorrow, then who would be so unwise as to kill any creature with sharp weapons? 

Now, explaining the fruits of violence through examples:

It is heard in the scriptures that Subhuma and Brahmadatta, being engrossed in cruel meditation, went to the seventh hell due to the killing of living beings. The explanation is that mere violence without cruel meditation does not cause going to hell. Otherwise, even a ascetic monk who kills a lion would go to hell. Therefore, Subhuma and Brahmadatta, who were engrossed in cruel meditation associated with violence, went to the seventh hell. How they went to hell is narrated sequentially.

The story of Chakravarti Subhuma:
In the city of Vasantapura, there lived a boy named Agnika. As there was no one in his lineage, it seemed as if he had directly fallen from the sky. One day, he set out to another country along with a caravan. But one day, getting separated from his caravan, he reached the ashram of a ascetic. The chief of the clan, named Jamadagni, accepted Agnika as his son. From then on, he became famous among the people as Jamadagni. Due to his intense penance, like the fire, he became an unbearable mass of radiance on the earth. Once, there was a dispute between the great listener deity Vaishvanara and the ascetic devotee deity Dhanvantari as to whose religion is authoritative. The listener deity said that the religion of the Arihanta is authoritative. To this, the ascetic devotee deity said that the ascetic religion is authoritative. In the end of this dispute, they decided to test who has more or less qualities between the Jain monk and the ascetic. 

At that time, the newly initiated King Vasupujya was going to Champapuri to take initiation. On the way, the two deities saw him and with the intention of testing him, they requested the king for food and water. But even though hungry and thirsty, the king refused to accept it, as it was not in accordance with the rules of the monk. The two testing deities then scattered thorns and pebbles sharp as knives all over the path, causing him immense pain; his feet were pierced and blood started flowing. Yet, he continued walking the harsh path considering it as soft as lotus. Then the deities arranged for dance, song, etc. to disturb the king, but he remained unmoved. As the influence of the divine discus does not work on one of the same lineage, similarly, their attempt also failed. Then the deities assumed the form of a perfected being's son and came before him, saying, "O fortunate one! You are still a young man with a long life ahead. So enjoy the pleasures according to your desire. How did the idea of penance occur to you in this youthful age? Even an enterprising person does not do the work of night in the morning. Therefore, brother! After the youthful age is over, when the body becomes weak and old age comes, then do penance." To this, the king said, "If my life is long, I will get a good opportunity to exhaust my karmas or accumulate merits. Just as the amount of water, so will the stem of the lotus grow. In youth, the senses are restless. Therefore, to do penance in this age itself is truly penance. Where fierce weapons and missiles are being attacked from both sides, the one who remains steadfast and displays valor, he is truly called a hero." When the king remained unwavering in his truth, no matter what means the deities used...

The Tale of Subhum Chakri
Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 27

The two gods, having not received the desired response, departed from there, thanking the sage Jamdagni with the words, "Blessed, blessed." They went to test the sage. Upon reaching the sage's hermitage, they saw that his long matted hair was as vast as a banyan tree and touched the ground. His feet were covered with termite mounds. In the tangled web of his beard, the gods, disguised as a pair of ducks, built their nest. Then the male duck said to the female duck, "I am going to the Himalayas." The female duck replied, "If you go there, you will fall in love with another duck and will not return. Therefore, I will not allow you to go." The male duck said, "My dear, if I do not return, I will be guilty of cow slaughter." Thus, the female duck, bound by the oath of the male duck, said, "My dear, if you swear by the sin of this sage, then I can allow you to go. May your journey be auspicious." Upon hearing this, the sage, filled with anger, grabbed both birds with both hands and said, "I perform such arduous austerities that just as darkness does not remain in the presence of the sun, how can my sins endure while I am engaged in my austerities?" To this, the male duck said to the sage, "Do not be angry. The truth is that your austerities are not successful, because 'Aputraasyagatirnasti' - 'Without a son, there is no good fortune for a man.' Have you not heard this scriptural saying?" Accepting the words of the birds as true, the sage thought, "I am without a wife and son, therefore my austerities have been wasted and have flowed away like water." Seeing the sage thus disturbed, Dhanvantari thought, "These sages have misled me. Curse them! I should abandon their company." With this thought, he also became a Shravak. "When there is realization, who does not have faith? Indeed, everyone does." After that, the two gods became invisible.

Meanwhile, Jamdagni, the sage, reached the city called Nemikoṣṭhaka. There, King Jitashatru ruled, the father of many daughters. Just as Mahadeva had gone to Daksha Prajapati for the sake of obtaining a daughter, so too did the sage go to the king with the desire to obtain a daughter. The king, standing up, welcomed him and, with folded hands, asked, "Lord, why have you come? Whatever your command, please speak, I am ready to serve you." To this, the sage said, "I have come to you to request a daughter." The king said, "I have a hundred daughters. Take whichever one you desire." The sage went into the inner apartments of the daughters and said to the princesses, "Which of you is willing to become my wife?" Hearing this unexpected proposal, the princesses looked at the sage and said, "Oh, matted-haired one! White-haired one! Weak one! Begging mendicant old man! Are you not ashamed to speak like this to us, young maidens?" Thus saying, the princesses spat upon him. Therefore, just as fire flares up from the wind, so too did the fire of anger flare up in Jamdagni. With the power of his austerities, he twisted the princesses into shapes like bent bows. At that time, seeing a girl playing on a pile of dust in the courtyard, the sage called her to him and said, "Oh, Renukā! Do you desire me?" Thus saying, he showed her the fruit of the Bijore tree. She also extended her hand, indicating acceptance. Just as a poor man clutches tightly to wealth, so too did the sage clutch the girl to his chest. Therefore, the king, giving cows as a gift, also gave the girl to him. Because of the affectionate relationship of a sister-in-law with the remaining 99 daughters of the king, the sage, with the power of his austerities, restored them to their former beauty. Curse the fools for this kind of waste of austerities! The princess was still young, innocent, and beautiful. Therefore, the sage took her to his hermitage. The days of the ascetic passed quickly. The girl now reached the lion gate of the beautiful youth, like the play-garden of Kamadeva. Just as Mahadeva had performed the ritual of accepting the hand of Parvati, so too did Jamdagni, the sage, marry the girl in the presence of fire. When she became of age, the sage said to her, "My dear, I am preparing a special food for you, blessed with a mantra. If you eat it, you will be blessed with a son who will be the best among Brahmins." To this, Renukā said to her husband, the sage, "My dear, my sister Anantvirya is the wife of the king of Hastinapur. Please prepare a Kshatriya food, blessed with a mantra, for her as well." The sage...

Jamdagni's marriage to Renuka and the birth of Parashurama, the taking of the kingdom, Yogashastra Dvitiya Prakash, verse 27. He prepared a Brahmachru for his wife and a Kshatracharu, imbued with mantras, for his sister-in-law to produce a Kshatriya son. When both the Charus were ready through mantra-sadhana, the tapaswi gave them to Renuka. Renuka thought, "I am here in this dense forest, unprotected like a deer. It would be good if I had a Kshatriya son who could protect me." Thinking thus, she consumed the Kshatracharu instead of the Brahmachru and gave the Brahmachru to her sister. In due time, both had sons. Renuka's son was named 'Rama' and her sister's son was named 'Kritavirya'. Despite being the son of a Rishi, their son 'Rama', with his Kshatriya prowess, grew stronger like a blazing fire in water at the hermitage of the tapaswi Jamdagni. One day, a Vidyadhara came to the ashram. He had lost his celestial knowledge due to suffering from dysentery. Rama, like a brother, served him with medicine and other things. In return for his service, the Vidyadhara gave Rama the Parshavi Vidya, the knowledge of the axe. He went into the forest called Sharavana and practiced the Parshavi Vidya. Due to this, Rama later became known as Parashurama.

Once, out of longing to meet her sister, Renuka asked her husband's permission and went to Hastinapur. For lovers, nothing is far. Seeing his sister-in-law, the charming Renuka, Anantvirya, showering her with love and affection, caressed her delicate limbs and engaged in amorous play with her. Truly, lust is very unruly. Just as Indra had experienced sexual pleasure with Ahalya, so too did Anantvirya, according to his desire, experience sensual pleasure with the tapaswi's wife. Just as Brihaspati had a son named Uththy from his wife Mamata, so too did Anantvirya have a son from Renuka. Rishi Jamdagni brought Renuka back home with her son. It is true that a man, engrossed in the allure of a woman, often does not see her faults. Seeing Renuka with her son, like a vine bearing fruit out of season, Parashurama became enraged. Without hesitation, he quickly killed the child with his axe. Renuka had this matter conveyed to Anantvirya through her sister. Hearing this, Anantvirya's anger flared up like fire from the wind. The extremely powerful and strong Anantvirya, the king, immediately arrived at Jamdagni's ashram. As soon as he arrived, like a maddened elephant, he destroyed and corrupted Jamdagni's ashram, uprooting the trees. He harassed the tapaswis there, taking away their cows, calves, and everything else. And, like a Kesari lion, Anantvirya, the king, returned to Hastinapur, dancing with joy. Hearing the lamentations of the distressed tapaswis, the account of the injustice done to them and the struggle they had endured, and knowing about the destruction of the ashram, Parashurama, filled with rage, ran with his axe, like Yama himself. Parashurama, the son of Jamdagni, eager to witness the battle of many warriors, chopped Anantvirya into pieces with his terrifying axe, like wood. After the death of Anantvirya, the leading citizens of the kingdom placed his son on the throne. He was still young. One day, hearing from his mother about the death of his father and receiving permission from his mother, he went and killed Jamdagni, like a serpent, to avenge his father's death. Parashurama's anger became extremely fierce at the news of his father's murder. He immediately reached Hastinapur and with a single blow of his axe, he killed Kritavirya. What is impossible for Yama? After the death of Kritavirya, Parashurama himself ascended the throne. The kingdom always belongs to the strong; there is no traditional order. Just as a deer flees in fear from a lion, so too did Kritavirya's pregnant wife, after Parashurama took control of Hastinapur, reach the ashram of the tapaswis in fear of Parashurama. The tapaswis kept her safe in a subterranean chamber, like a treasure.

One day, the queen gave birth to a beautiful and healthy son at an auspicious time, indicated by fourteen great dreams, in the subterranean chamber. Because she was kept safe in the subterranean chamber, her mother named him 'Subhumi'. Wherever there were Kshatriyas, Parashurama's axe became a living embodiment of fiery anger, burning and killing thousands of Kshatriyas. One day, Parashurama accidentally came to the ashram where Subhumi was being raised. Wherever there is smoke, there is fire.

The attainment of hell by Subhūmachkravarti due to violence

It is definitely stated in the Yogaśāstra, Second Light, verse 27, that due to violence, Subhūmachkravarti will attain hell. By this justice, the Kshatriya indicator, Parashurama's axe, began to burn there. Therefore, he immediately asked the ascetics, "Is there any Kshatriya here?" They said, "We have become ascetics, being Kshatriyas." Just as a mountain peak is made grassless by a wildfire, so after that, Parashurama made the earth Kshatriya-less seven times with his fiery anger. Therefore, Parashurama filled the shining platter, like the full-fledged recipient of Yama, with the teeth of the destroyed Kshatriyas, equal to his fulfilled aspirations. Once, he asked some fortune-tellers, "By whose hands will I be killed?" The one who harbors enmity and opposition always has a constant fear of death from his enemies. Those fortune-tellers said, "These teeth will turn into kheer (rice pudding) upon the gaze of one, and the one who sits on that throne and eats that kheer, he will be your killer in the future." Parashurama built a charitable kitchen where anyone could come and receive charity without any restrictions. He established a throne in front of it and placed that platter filled with teeth on it.

Meanwhile, in the ashram, Subhūma, nurtured and raised by the ascetics every day, grew day by day like a tree planted in the courtyard. One day, a Vidyadhara named Meghnāth asked a fortune-teller, "My daughter, Padmashri, has become wise. To whom should I give her?" Then, after calculating, he said, "Make Subhūma, with his well-proportioned shoulders, her husband." Meghnāth, seeing an auspicious time, performed the wedding ceremony of his daughter with Subhūma and himself became his attendant. Subhūma, ignorant of other places like a frog in a well, one day asked his mother, "Mother! Is this the only world? Is there nothing beyond this?" His mother said, "Son! The world has no end. Our ashram is in this world, in a space as small as the space for a fly to land its foot. In this world, there is a famous city called Hastinapur. There, your father, the mighty King Kritavīrya, ruled. One day, Parashurama killed your father and took control of his kingdom. He made this earth Kshatriya-less. It is because of his fear that we are living here." Hearing this, Subhūma, who was angry at his enemy like Mars, immediately went to Hastinapur. Truly, Kshatriya valor is invincible. He went straight to Parashurama's charitable kitchen like a lion and sat on the throne. The teeth instantly turned into kheer. The mighty Subhūma ate that kheer. Just as a lion kills deer, so too, Meghnāth, the Vidyadhara, killed all the Brahmins who were stationed there for protection, eager for war. Parashurama, with his beard and hair fluttering, biting his lips in anger, came there quickly like the noose of death, where Subhūma was. As soon as he arrived, he threw his axe at Subhūma. But it became calm instantly, like fire in water. Seeing no other weapon at that time, Subhūma also picked up that platter of teeth and started spinning it like a wheel. It also instantly became a jewel-studded wheel. Truly, if one has virtuous wealth, then what is impossible? Now, Subhūma had manifested as the eighth Chakravarti. Therefore, he cut off Parashurama's head with that radiant wheel, like a lotus. Just as Parashurama had made the earth Kshatriya-less seven times, so too, Subhūma made the earth Brahmin-less twenty-one times. After that, Subhūma, with his newly formed army, first conquered the east, liberating the elephants, horses, chariots, and infantry of the former king, shedding a new river of blood. After that, Subhūma, who adorned the earth with the severed heads of many warriors, conquered the south like the lord of the south, and achieved victory there. After achieving victory, he hoisted the victory flag everywhere. Then, effortlessly, opening the Vaitalya cave, Subhūma, mighty like Mount Meru, entered the Uttarakhand region of India to conquer the Mlechchas. In this way, traveling in all four directions, Subhūma devoured the warriors and the earth in the same way that two millstones grind grains. Similarly, he scattered the bones of the warriors on the western coast as a sign of victory in the west, as if seashells and conch shells were spread all around the coast. In this way, Subhūma performed the six-fold practice. Continuously killing the five-sense beings and constantly burning his inner self with the fire of fierce meditation, Subhūma Chakravarti died and went to the seventh hell. 1. In another story, there is a description of death while going to the seventh section.

The Story of Brahmadutt Chakravarti
From the Yogashastra, Second Illumination, Verse 27:

In ancient times, in the city of Saket, there was a king named Chandravamsak. He had a son named Munichandra, who had a charming, moon-like appearance. Detached from the burdens of worldly pleasures, he took initiation (diksha) from Sagarchandramuni. While following the venerable path of renunciation, he once went on a journey with his guru to another region. On the way, he went to a village for alms, but by the time he returned, the caravan had already left. Separated from the caravan, he began to wander alone in the forest, like a deer separated from the herd. Afflicted by hunger and thirst, he fell ill there. Four cowherds then took care of him like kinsmen. To repay their kindness, the monk gave them spiritual teachings. Indeed, noble people show compassion even to those who have harmed them, so why not to their benefactors? Hearing the teachings, the cowherds became detached from the world and took initiation from the monk. The four of them appeared as if the four types of dharma had taken embodied form. Two of them diligently practiced the dharma, while the other two despised it. "Ah, how strange the ways of dharma are!" Those two monks who criticized dharma also eventually went to the celestial realm after completing their lifespan. "Indeed, even a single day's penance can surely take the soul to heaven."

After their celestial sojourn, they were born as twin sons to a maidservant named Jayavanti, belonging to the Shandilya Brahmin family in the city of Dashpur. As they grew up, they started taking care of the fields as per their father's instructions, as is the duty of servant-born sons. One night, a black snake emerged from a hole in the field where they were sleeping and bit one of them, just like the brother of Yama (the god of death). When the other brother woke up and tried to find the snake, the wicked snake suddenly attacked and bit him as well. There was no one there to remove the poison, so the poor fellows succumbed to death right there. They departed from this world just as they had arrived. Cursed is the fruitless birth in this world.

After death, they were born as a pair of deer in the meadows of the Kalinjara mountain. One day, while the two deer were grazing together affectionately, a hunter suddenly shot them both with a single arrow. Dying there, they were then born as a pair of swans in the womb of a royal swan in the Ganga river. Once, as the two swans were playing in a lake, a water predator caught them and twisted their necks, killing them. Indeed, this is the fate of the unrighteous.

After that, they were born as the two sons, named Chitra and Sambhuti, of the wealthy Matanga chieftain Bhutadatta in Varanasi. Here too, they were deeply attached to each other, inseparable like nails and flesh.

At that time, King Shankha was ruling in Varanasi, and his prime minister was the renowned Namuchi. One day, the king handed over Namuchi to the Chandala (outcaste) Bhutadatta to be executed for some grave offense. The king said, "If you secretly educate my two sons in the underground chamber, I will protect you as my own kinsman." Namuchi accepted the Matanga's words, for a person seeking livelihood will do anything.

Namuchi then began teaching various disciplines to Chitra and Sambhuti. Meanwhile, he also developed an inappropriate relationship with the wife of Matanga chieftain Bhutadatta. When Bhutadatta learned of this, he was enraged and prepared to kill him. But the Matanga sons secretly helped Namuchi escape to save his life. Fleeing from there, Namuchi went to Hastinapura and became the minister of Sanatkumara Chakravarti.

Meanwhile, as Chitra and Sambhuti grew up, they began to roam the earth freely, like the Ashwini Kumara devas.

The Story of Brahmadatta Chakri

The two brothers played music that was sweeter than the verses of the Yogashastra's second chapter. They outperformed even Narada in playing the tambura and veena. When they played the veena with the seven clear notes mentioned in the musical compositions, even the Kinnaras (celestial musicians) appeared insignificant before them. And when the two with deep voices played the mridanga, it evoked the memory of Krishna carrying the bone-cage-like instrument of the demon Mura.

The dramas they enacted were such that even Mahadeva (Shiva), Urvashi, Rambha, Muni, Keshi, Tilottama and others were unaware of. It seemed as if these two were the embodiment of the entire Gandharva-vidya (the art of music) and the second avatars of Vishwakarma.

Indeed, their music, which was so vividly expressed, how could it not captivate the minds of all?

Once, during a festival of love in the city, the skilled musical groups of the city passed by the abodes of Chitra and Sambhuti. Many citizens, men and women, attracted by their songs, gathered around them in herds like deer. Seeing this, some citizens went to the king and complained, "Two Matangas (outcasts) have come to the city. By singing and playing beautiful songs, they are attracting people towards themselves and corrupting everyone."

Hearing this, the king immediately summoned the chief of police and ordered, "Beware! These two should never be allowed in the city." Due to this royal decree, the two then started residing in Varanasi.

One day, there was a festival in the city. On that day, these two restless Matanga brothers violated the king's order and entered the city, roaming around like elephants in the city square. Wearing burqas and disguised as thieves, the two Matanga sons were secretly watching the festival in the city. Just as one jackal calls out on hearing the voice of another jackal, these two also started singing sweetly on hearing the voices of the city's musicians.

Hearing their melodious songs that were pleasing to the ears, the young men of the city started circling around them like bees around a beehive. People tried to find out who they were and pulled off their burqas. Seeing them, the people exclaimed, "Ah, these are the same two Chandala (outcasts)! Villains, stand still!" Saying this, the people pounced on them. Many beat them with sticks, stones, etc. and severely humiliated them.

Bowing their heads in shame, the two silently left the city, just as dogs slink away with their tails between their legs. A large crowd of people followed them. At that time, they appeared as if the entire army had pounced on a small rabbit.

Stumbling at every step and running with great difficulty, they finally reached the garden called Gambhira. There, the two brothers contemplated, "Just as milk contaminated by a snake becomes impure, similarly, our skills, beauty, etc. have become accursed due to being tainted by the Chandala caste. Not only have our merits not been appreciated, but we have also been subjected to calamity. Therefore, to bear such cowardice would only lead to further misery. Since art, charm, and beauty are associated with the body, and the body has now become a home of misfortune, it should be discarded quickly like a straw."

Resolving thus, the two were prepared to give up their lives. At that time, they were walking towards the south, as if going to confront death. As they walked on, they saw a mountain. Climbing up, they looked down and saw something the size of a baby elephant or boar. Therefore, they decided to jump off this mountain to commit suicide by falling (Bhrigupath).

However, as they were climbing the mountain, they encountered a great sage who was like a mobile mountain of virtues. Seeing the sage on the mountain peak, like clouds in the rainy season, the two were freed from their sorrow and anguish. Tears of joy gushed from their eyes, as if they were renouncing their past sorrows.

They fell at the lotus feet of the revered sage. The sage, after deep contemplation, asked them, "My children, who are you? How and why have you come here?"

They narrated their entire story. The sage said to them, "My children, while the destruction of the body can certainly be achieved through Bhrigupath, the elimination of the inauspicious karmas accumulated over hundreds of births cannot be accomplished that way. If you wish to renounce this body, then attain the fruit of the body and worship the great causes of liberation and heaven, i.e., austerities. That alone will purify you both physically and spiritually."

The Story of Brahmadatt Chakra

The second light of Yoga Shastra, verse 27, says, "It will liberate one from all mental sorrows." Thus, by drinking the nectar of the teachings, those two pure-hearted youths accepted the path of the saints from the said sage.

Becoming monks, they studied the scriptures deeply and gradually became learned. "What cannot be achieved by a wise person who adopts something with respect?" They performed extremely rigorous austerities like Shashtha-Ashtama (Bela-Tela), etc., and not only weakened their past karma but also made their bodies thin. While wandering from village to village and from city to city, they once arrived in Hastinapur. There, they resided in a garden called Ruchir and began to perform difficult austerities. "For a peaceful mind, even a place of enjoyment becomes a place of austerity."

One day, Sambhutimuni was going through the royal road for the sake of taking food after the completion of his monthly fast (Masakshapan), when suddenly he was seen by the minister Namuchi. As soon as he saw him, he recognized him and thought, "This is the same Matangputra. Maybe he will expose me in front of someone." "A sinner is always suspicious." "Before he reveals my secret to anyone here, I will get him out of the city." Thinking this, the minister quietly called a soldier and entrusted him with this task. Even on his former benefactor who gave him life, the wicked Namuchi started to wreak havoc. It is true, "A favor done to a wicked person is like giving milk to a snake." Just as sticks fall on grains of food, so did sticks fall on Sambhutimuni. Therefore, the muni left that place far away without taking alms. Although he left the city, those who were beating him continued to beat him. When the muni sat down in a place with confidence, smoke of the color of clouds came out of his mouth, which spread all around, as if clouds had gathered in the sky untimely. Gradually, the smoke moved rapidly towards the sky and took the form of a blazing fire. Now it seemed as if a blaze was coming out of the electric sphere. Frightened and curious citizens, in order to please Muni Sambhutimuni, who was more radiant than Vishnu Kumar, started coming there in groups.

King Sanatkumar also came there. Because a wise person tries to extinguish the fire from where it originates. The king bowed to the muni and said, "O Bhagavan! Is it right for you to do this? Even after being scorched by the rays of the sun, the Chandrakantamani never produces fire. All these have offended you. This has made you angry. While churning the Kshir-Samudra, did not the poison of Kal-Kuta come out of it? The anger of righteous people is not like the affection of wicked people. Even if it happens, it does not last long. Even if it lasts for a long time, it does not bear fruitful results. What can we say to a wise person like you in this matter? Still, I request you, O Nath! Give up this wicked anger. A great soul like you has the same vision for both the offender and the benefactor." When Chitramuni knew this, he also arrived there to pacify Shri Sambhutimuni. As soon as he heard the scriptural words, sweet like the words of a good elephant, his anger subsided just as the mountain fire is extinguished by the rain. Freed from the darkness of great anger, the great sage Sambhutimuni became happy like the full moon in an instant. Therefore, the crowd bowed to him, apologized, and returned to their places. Chitramuni and Sambhutimuni reached the garden from there. There, both the monks started repenting, "Wandering from house to house for food causes great sorrow, but this body runs only on the nourishment of food. But what is the need of this body and food for yogis?" Thus, having decided in their minds, both the monks accepted the four-fold food renunciation (Santhara) in the form of a fast unto death (Santhara) after performing Sanlekhana.

One day, the king thought, "I am the protector of the land. Who has insulted the saints in my kingdom by harassing them in this way? I should find out." From a secret agent, the king found out that these deeds were done by the minister Namuchi. "He who does not worship the worshipable is called a sinner, then how much more should he be called a terrible sinner who kills a worshipable person?" Therefore, at the command of the Chakravarti, the guards arrested the minister Namuchi and presented him before the king.

The Story of Brahmadutta Chakra

Chapter 2 of the Yagshastra, Second Light, Verse 27:

With pure intentions, the king paraded the offending minister throughout the city, so that no one else would dare to trouble a Sadhu in such a manner. Finally, the Chakravarti bowed his head, adorned with a jeweled crown, at the feet of both Munis. At that moment, it seemed as if the king was showering the earth with water from the crown jewel on his head. With their mouths covered by a cloth, the Munis raised their right hands and blessed the king with Dharma-laabh, praising his virtue.

The king, with humility, requested, "Munivar! The offender should receive the fruits of his actions (duष्कर्म)." Pointing towards Namuchi, the emperor, Sanatkumar, requested the Munis to forgive him. The Munis instructed them to forgive him. Thus, despite being worthy of death, the king, following the Guru's command, released him. Just as a serpent cannot stay near a Garuda, similarly, Namuchi, the Chandala who had committed a heinous act, was banished from the city and the country, living a life like a dead man, separated from Sanatkumar and the Muni.

Sunanda, the chief queen of Chakravarti Sanatkumar, inspired by devotion, went to pay her respects to both Munis, accompanied by her 64,000 co-wives. While paying her respects to Sambhuti Muni, the noble woman bowed down, touching her hair to his lotus feet. At that moment, it seemed as if she was making the earth moon-like. As soon as the touch of her delicate hair reached Sambhuti Muni, he felt a thrill. Truly, "Kamadeva always seeks an opening." When the queen, seeking their permission, expressed her desire to visit the inner palace, Sambhuti Muni, defeated by desire, made a resolution (duष्कल्प) in his mind: "If my arduous penance bears any fruit, let it be that I become the husband of such a noble woman in my next birth." At that moment, Chitramuni stopped him, saying, "Brother! Why do you desire such a base fruit from your penance, which is meant for liberation? Why are you placing a jewel worthy of being worn on your head on the ground? Abandon this resolution (नियाणे) born out of attachment. Such a thought does not seem appropriate for a great Muni like you. Say 'मिच्छा मि दुक्कडं' (May this wrong deed of mine be false) right now." Even though Chitramuni tried to stop him, Sambhuti Muni did not abandon his resolution. Indeed, the desire for worldly pleasures is very strong.

After performing the Anashan (fasting) with proper rituals, both Munis completed their lifespan and were born as Devas in a beautiful celestial chariot called Saudharma.

The soul of Chitramuni, after leaving the first Devaloka, was born as the son of a Seth in the city of Purimatal. The soul of Sambhuti Muni, after leaving Devaloka, was born in the womb of Chulnidevi, the wife of the Brahma Raja, in the city of Kampilya. The mother saw fourteen auspicious dreams. Knowing the auspicious and prosperous future, Queen Chulni gave birth to her son in the same way that the east gives birth to the sun. Filled with joy and immersed in Brahma, the Brahma Raja named his son Brahmadutta, a name famous throughout the universe. He grew day by day, like a pure moon, bringing joy to the eyes of the world and absorbing many arts. Just as Brahma has four faces, the Brahma Raja had four dear friends: Katak, the king of Kashi; Kanerdatta, the king of Hastinapur; Dirgha, the king of Kosala; and Pushpachulak, the king of Champa. These five friend-kings, out of love for each other, would stay together in each other's cities for a year, like Nandanvan and Kalpvriksha. Once, it was the turn of the five kings to gather in the city of the Brahma Raja. Therefore, the other four kings came there. They all spent most of their time there, enjoying themselves and playing. But when Brahmadutta turned twelve years old, suddenly, an unbearable pain arose in the Brahma Raja's head, and he died from it. After the Brahma Raja's death rituals, the four kings, Katak and the others, like a tangible remedy, met and discussed seriously and decisively, "Brahmadutta is still a child. Until he becomes an adult, one of us should stay here as a guardian to protect the kingdom." The friend-kings agreed to this and appointed Dirgha Raja to stay there to protect the kingdom. The other three friend-kings returned to their respective places. Just as a bull (सांढ) enters a field and grazes everything when it sees the field unprotected, similarly, Dirgha, with his foolish mind, also began to plunder the wealth of the kingdom.

The Tale of Brahmadutta Chakra

Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 27 |  Considering him unprotected, he began to enjoy him at will without any hesitation. Just as a wicked person finds the flaw of another through long association, so too did the wicked-minded Dirgha find the secret treasure trove after a long time. Due to prior acquaintance, he began to roam freely in the inner apartments of Brahmaraja. Indeed, dominance often makes a man commit evil deeds. Therefore, Dirgha now began to enjoy himself with Chulani Devi in solitude, with loving words, jokes, and laughter. This secret conspiracy was going to pierce him with the arrows of lust. In this way, Dirgha Raja, disregarding his duty, the kindness of Brahmaraja, and the norms of society, became deeply attached to Chulani Rani. 'Indeed, it is very difficult to control the senses.' Chulani Rani also abandoned her devotion to Brahmaraja and her friendship with Dirgha Raja, as he was her husband's friend. Indeed, 'Kamadeva is the destroyer of all.'  A long time passed like a moment, as they enjoyed themselves according to their desires. When Dhanu, the close confidante of Brahmaraja, came to know about the secret misconduct of Dirgha Raja and Chulani Rani, he fell into thought. He thought that Chulani Devi was inherently indulging in misconduct against the virtue of being a wife. Indeed, 'Virtuous women are rare.' The same Dirgha Raja, to whom Brahmaraja had entrusted the task of protecting and managing the kingdom, treasury, and inner apartments with trust, was now betraying that trust and indulging in revelry with Brahmaraja's queen. Nothing was wrong for him today. It is possible that he might do something bad to the prince now. A wicked man does not consider even the one who nourishes him as his own. Thinking thus, he ordered his son Vardhanu, 'Son! You stay in the service of Brahmadutta Kumar and inform me if there is any wrong thing or any new news.'

When the minister's son told Brahmadutta Kumar about the unprecedented incident happening in the inner apartments, Brahmadutta also became enraged with anger, slowly like a drunken elephant. When the news of his mother's misconduct became unbearable, one day Brahmadutta went to the inner apartments with a crow and a cuckoo. Addressing his mother and Dirgha Raja, he said, 'These two who spread miscegenation, and anyone else like them, deserve to be killed. I will surely punish such people.' Hearing this, Dirgha Raja said to Chulani, 'Did you hear your son's words? He is calling me a crow and you a cuckoo, and if he gets the chance, he will surely imprison us both.' To this, the queen said, 'You don't need to be afraid of the child's words at all. Once, taking a boar to the inner apartments with a noble elephant, Dirgha Raja, under the pretext of inspiring his mother and himself, began to scold both the animals, as before, with reproachful words. Hearing this, Dirgha Raja's ears perked up. He again said to the queen, 'Look, again this child is targeting us.' To this, Chulani Rani said, 'He is still a naive child, whatever he says, we should not pay attention to his words.' One day, Brahmadutta took a goose and a heron to the inner apartments and, addressing both of them, said, 'Beware! If anyone does what this goose does with the heron, I will not tolerate it at all.' Then Dirgha said to the queen, 'Devi! Look, again your son is spewing words filled with the fire of anger, like a blazing fire. As he grows older, he will become as dangerous to us both as a lion is to an elephant and a she-elephant. Therefore, before he becomes young and powerful, this poisonous tree should be uprooted. Hearing this, the queen trembled. She said, 'No, no, dear! How can I do this? Even animals protect their offspring, then I, being a human and his mother, should protect him. Moreover, he is the heir to the kingdom. My heart trembles at the thought of his destruction.' To this, Dirgha Raja said, 'The time for your childbirth is approaching. Why worry in vain? As long as I am here, it is not difficult for you to have a son.' Hearing this, Chulani, like a Sakini, became infatuated with sexual pleasure and, blinded by affection, abandoned her maternal love and agreed with Dirgha Raja. But she was also afraid of disgrace. Therefore, she said to Dirgha Raja, 'Dear! Devise some conspiracy so that we are not disgraced and he is also destroyed. I want this work to be done without any delay.

The Tale of Brahmadatt Chakra

The second light of Yoga Shastra, verse 27: It seems strange, like watering an mango grove on one hand and performing Pitru Tarpan on the other. Or, let's do this, the Kumar's marriage should be arranged and a Lakshagriha should be prepared for this under the pretext of a residence, which should not have any secret entrances or exits. After the marriage, the prince should be taken to the Lakshagriha with his wife. At night, when they both fall asleep, set it on fire; so that they will die inside. Neither will we be defamed nor will there be any danger for us again.' Thus, both of them conspired secretly. The very next day, the prince's engagement was fixed with the daughter of King Pushpachul and preparations for the marriage began in full swing.

Meanwhile, Dhanumantri, knowing the evil intentions of the two, pleaded with Dirghraja with folded hands, 'Rajan! My son Vardhanu has become proficient in all arts and is skilled in ethics. Therefore, he, like a young bull, is capable of lifting your chariot-wheel of command. I, like an old bull, am unable to go anywhere or bear the burden of royal orders. If you permit, I will go to a peaceful place and perform Dharma-anushthan in my last days.' Hearing this, Dirghraja felt apprehensive that this magician might go elsewhere and do something wrong; or he might expose us.' Dirghraja said to Dhanumantri in deceitful words, 'Aji! Buddhiniधान Pradhanmantriji! Just as the night does not shine without the moon; similarly, this kingdom does not shine without you. Therefore, do not go anywhere else. Build a Dānasālā here and do your Dharma. What is the need to go far? Just as a garden is adorned with beautiful trees, so will this kingdom be adorned by you.' Upon this, the wise Dhanumantri built a holy Dānamṇḍapa, like a great umbrella of Dharma, on the banks of the Bhagirathi river. He built a Dānasālā there and started an uninterrupted flow of charity like the flow of the Ganga. In this, food, water, etc. were given to the travelers. Along with this, Dhanumantri had a two-kos long tunnel dug from the Dānasālā to the newly built Lakshagriha by men who were made trustworthy through charity, respect and kindness. On the other hand, he informed Pushpachul of the entire conspiracy taking place through Dirgh by a secret letter, like water for watering the Maitreevriksha. The wise Pushpachul, knowing this to be true, instead of sending his daughter, sent a dasi-putra, like a heron, adorned with gem-studded ornaments, in her place. That dasi-putra entered the city as the daughter of Pushpachul. It is true, simple people mistake brass for gold. The sky echoed with auspicious sweet songs and instruments. The shehnais played. Brahmadatt's marriage with that girl took place with great pomp and joy. After sending off all other families, Chulani sent the Kumar to the Lakshagriha with the new bride as soon as night began. The new bride, the Kumar and Vardhanu, like his shadow, came there along with the other families. Brahmadatt Kumar spent half the night talking with the minister's son. 'Where is sleep in the eyes of the Mahatmas at such a time?' Chulani ordered the trusted servants to set fire to the Lakshagriha. The servants set fire to the palace made of lac. As soon as the fire caught, the Lakshagriha was engulfed in flames in a matter of moments. Gradually, its black smoke spread throughout the sky, as if the infamy of Chulani's long-standing evil deeds was spreading. Today, the seven-tongued hungry fire became an all-devouring one with millions of tongues with its blazing flames. When Brahmadatt asked the minister's son, 'What is this?' in reply, he revealed the entire story of Chulani's wicked deeds. And finally, telling him how to escape, he said, 'Like rescuing a beautiful woman from the trunk of an elephant, a tunnel has been built by my father to get you out of here to the Dānasālā. Therefore, kick this door hard and open it, and enter the tunnel just as a yogi enters a hole with yogic strength.' As soon as the Kumar kicked the door, which was like a clay-made Samputa-vadya-yantra, the door of the tunnel rattled and opened. Brahmadatt Kumar, along with his friend, escaped through the tunnel, just as a thread comes out of a hole in a gem. As soon as they crossed the tunnel, two well-equipped horses, saddled by Dhanumantri, were standing ready outside. The prince

The Tale of Brahmadatt Chakra

Yogashastra Dvitiya Prakash Shloka 27 and the minister's son both mounted, as if they were two sons of the sun. Both horses were running so fast at the speed of Panchmadharagati that fifty yojanas were like one kos for them. But alas! Both horses died of exhaustion in the middle. Therefore, from there onwards, both of them walked on foot, barely reaching near Kosthakagran, protecting their lives.

Then Brahmadatt said to his friend Var Dhanu - 'Friend! Should we still compete with each other? I am very hungry and thirsty. I am dying from these. The minister's son said something in the prince's ear and then - 'Stay here for a moment.' Saying this, he went ahead. To shave the prince's head, the minister's son brought a barber from the village by force. At the minister's son's behest, Brahmadatt had all his hair cut except for one braid. Then he wore saffron-colored holy clothes. At that time, he looked as if the sun was hidden in the colorful clouds of the evening. Minister's son Var Dhanu put a Brahmasutra around his neck. Now he was truly the son of Brahmaraja, making his name Brahmputra meaningful. Just as the sun is covered by the clouds in the rainy season, the minister's son covered Brahmadatt's chest with the Srivatsa mark with a northern cloth. In this way, the minister's son, like a sutradhar, changed the appearance of the Brahmputra and changed his own appearance in the same way. Thus, like the full moon and the sun, both friends entered the village. There, a Brahmin invited them for food. He served them food with devotion, like a king. 'Usually, the respect is given according to the brilliance of the face.' After the meal, the Brahmin's wife, adorned with a pair of white clothes, appeared like an apsara; who started putting akshat on the Kumar's head. Seeing this, Var Dhanu said to the Brahmin, 'Confused! Why are you tying this girl around the neck of this artless boy, like a cow around the neck of a bull?' In reply, the learned Brahmin said - 'This is my daughter named Bandhumati, who is charming with her qualities. I don't see anyone else worthy of her except her. The knowledgeable people had told me that her husband would be the Chakravarti, the ruler of the six continents. And this is he. They also told me that his Srivatsa mark would be covered with a cloth and he would eat at your house. Give this girl to him.' At that time, the Brahmin married the girl to Brahmadatt. 'Fortunate enjoyers get abundant enjoyment without any thought.' Brahmadatt stayed there that night and, after assuring Bandhumati, moved on. How can one stay in one place when enemies are chasing him? From there, both of them reached a village early in the morning, where they heard that Dirghraja had posted guards on all the routes to catch Brahmadatt. Therefore, they started walking on a winding path. Running and fleeing, they came to a dense forest full of ferocious animals like the fierce soldiers of Dirghraja. There, leaving the thirsty Kumar under a banyan tree, Var Dhanu went to fetch water with the speed of mind. There, it was recognized that 'this is Var Dhanu, therefore, just as dogs surround a piglet, the angry soldiers of Dirghraja surrounded him. Then they started shouting loudly - 'Hey. Catch him. Catch him! Kill him. Kill him.' Thus, speaking in a terrible manner, they caught him and tied him up. Then they asked him about Brahmadatt. Var Dhanu gestured to Brahmadatt to run away. Brahmadatt ran away from there. 'The test of courage comes only when the time comes.' Kumar also crossed one big forest after another rapidly, without getting tired, and kept moving forward with his fists clenched. In this way, he reached an ashram. There, he ate tasteless and unappetizing fruits. From there, on the third day, he saw a tapasvi! He asked him - 'O Bhagavan! Where is your ashram?' The tapasvi took the Kumar to his ashram. Because 'tapasvis are fond of guests.' The Kumar, seeing the head of the ashram, considered him like his father and greeted him with joy. 'The mind is considered as evidence for an unknown thing.' The head of the ashram asked him - 'Vats! How did you come here, a rough person like a Kalpavriksha in the desert?' Brahmputra told the Mahatma his whole story till the end. Because such men are usually not hidden from. On hearing this, the head of the ashram said with a choked voice, filled with joy - 'Vats! I am your father's younger brother. We were different in body, but our hearts

The Tale of Brahmadatt Chakra

"Brahmadatt Chakra was inseparable from the second light of Yoga Shastra, verse 27. Therefore, consider this ashram your home and stay here as long as you wish, happily, and increase our penance with our aspirations."  Delighting the mothers, Sarvallabh Kumar also began to reside in that ashram. In the meantime, the rainy season arrived. While residing in his ashram, the headmaster taught the Kumar the scriptures and the arts of weaponry in the same way that Baldev had taught Shri Krishna. After the rainy season, filled with the chirping of cranes and as close as brothers, was complete, the ascetics of the ashram went to the nearby forest to gather fruits. Even though the headmaster respectfully tried to stop him, Brahmaputr went into the forest with the ascetics, just as an elephant walks with its young. While wandering in the forest, Brahmaputr saw fresh dung and urine of an elephant in one place. He thought, "There must be an elephant nearby." The ascetics strongly dissuaded him from going further. Still, he followed the elephant's footprints for five yojanas, where he saw a mountain-like elephant.

With a single loincloth tied tightly, the Kumar roared like a blacksmith. Just as one wrestler challenges another, Brahmadatt, like an elephant among humans, challenged the elephant. Therefore, the red-faced elephant, enraged, trembled with all its limbs, extended its trunk, held its ears steady, and lunged towards the Kumar. As the elephant approached the Kumar, he threw a garment in the middle to distract the elephant, as if to lure a child. As if a piece of the sky had fallen from the sky, the elephant, in extreme anger, grabbed the garment tightly with its two tusks in an instant. Just as a charmer makes a snake dance, the Kumar, with various tricks, made the elephant turn around. At that very moment, like Brahmadatt's other friend, the clouds roared, and the rain attacked the elephant with its water stream. Therefore, the elephant roared and fled like a deer. The Kumar also wandered towards the mountain, reaching a river. He crossed the river like a calamity. On the bank of the river, he saw an old, ruined city. As he entered, he saw a sword and shield lying in a pile of bamboo, like a destructive comet and a protective moon. The Kumar, curious about the art of wielding weapons, picked them up out of curiosity and first cut down the large pile of bamboo with the sword, like a banana tree. In the pile of bamboo, he saw a human head like a lotus on the ground, with its lips fluttering. Looking closely, he realized that the fresh severed torso of a man smoking with his head upside down was lying there. Seeing this ghastly sight, he said in a repentant tone, "I have killed an innocent scholar, damn me!" As the Kumar took a step forward, he saw a garden like Nandanvan, descended from heaven to earth. As he entered, he saw a seven-story palace in front of him, as if it had fainted from the beauty of the seven realms and fallen here. As the Kumar climbed the towering palace, he saw a woman like a Khechari, sitting with her face in her palm, in a thoughtful posture. The Kumar moved a little forward and asked her in a clear voice, "Lady! How are you sitting here alone? Your facial expression suggests that you have some deep concern. If it is not a problem to tell me, tell me - what is the reason for your concern?" The terrified woman replied in a choked voice, "Sir! My story is very long. But first, tell me who you are. Please introduce yourself." The Kumar introduced himself, saying, "I am Brahmadatt Kumar, son of the king of Panchal." Hearing this, she jumped with joy, and tears of joy streamed from her eyes. She fell at his feet, as if washing his feet, and cried, "Kumar! Like a boat for someone drowning in the sea, I, the helpless woman, have found your shelter." After the Kumar reassured her and asked, she said, "Sir! I am the daughter of your mother's brother, Pushpachul, named Pushpavati. My parents have given me to you. While waiting for the day of marriage, I went to play in the garden by the well, like a swan. Just as Ravana abducted Sita and took her to Lanka, in the same way, a wicked Vidyaadhar named Natyonmatt abducted me and brought me here. Unable to bear my sight, he entered this bamboo grove for the purpose of Vidya Sadhana, like the son of Shuparnakha. There, he was smoking, with his feet up,

The Tale of Brahmadatt Chakri
The second light of Yoga Shastra, verse 27, is engaged in the pursuit of knowledge. If today he attains mastery over knowledge, he will marry me today with proper rituals. I am worried about how to escape from his clutches!' Hearing this, the prince narrated the entire story of how he had eliminated the person who was hiding in the pile of bamboo. Pushpavati was overjoyed at the attainment of her beloved and the destruction of the unpleasant. This couple, who were traditionalists, performed a Gandharva marriage right there. Such marriages, performed willingly without mantras, are considered the best among Kshatriyas. The night passed quickly, like a single watch, as he engaged in conversation and amorous play with her, using various sweet words. As dawn broke, Brahmadatt heard a sound in the sky, like the bleating of a flock of celestial women. With a look of wonder, he asked Pushpavati, 'Where and how is this sound suddenly occurring in the sky, like untimely rain without clouds?' She said nervously, 'My love! This sound is of the arrival of the Vidyaadhar maidens named Visakha, who are mad with drama. They are coming to marry you, for no reason. Truly, 'A being thinks one thing in his mind, and destiny brings about something else.' In my opinion, you should leave from here for a while. I will praise your qualities and see what the reaction of the Vidyaadharis is. Do they feel affection or aversion towards you? When I see that they have affection for you, I will show a red flag. Upon seeing it, you should return. If they have aversion towards you, I will show a white flag. Seeing that, you should leave.'
Hearing this, Brahmadatt said, 'My love! Don't worry at all. Am I such a coward that I would run away from them? What can they do to me, whether they are angry or pleased?' Pushpavati said, 'My love! I am not saying that you are afraid of them. But perhaps the Vidyaadharas associated with them will become your enemies and create some unnecessary obstacle. So, what harm is there in knowing their attitude? You hide in a corner somewhere for a while and watch.' Agreeing to this, the prince hid to one side. Pushpavati, knowing the Vidyaadharis were favorable to the prince, mistakenly waved a white flag instead of a red one. Seeing it, the prince, out of devotion to his beloved, moved on from there. Courageous men fear no one. He saw a lake there. Just as the Airavata elephant enters the Manasarovar, so too did the prince enter it. After bathing in it and drinking the nectar-like water as he wished, Brahmadatt crossed that formidable forest and reached the bank of a great lake in the evening, just as birds, after flying in the sky all day, return to their nests in the evening, and the sun, after roaming in the sky all day, enters the sea in the evening. From there, walking in the morning, the prince reached the bank of a lake by noon. After bathing and washing properly there, and drinking the sweet, nectar-like water, he came out of it. Then, on the edge of the forest in the northwest direction, he saw a beautiful woman, like a forest goddess herself, picking flowers from the bushes of trees and vines; as if she were asking, through the sound of the buzzing bees, 'Did you bathe well in the lake?' Seeing her, the prince thought, 'Brahma must have practiced creating countless forms from birth till now; only then could he have manifested such beauty in this woman.' Talking to her maidservant, she looked with bright eyes, like jasmine flowers, and walked away from there, as if she had placed a garland around the prince's neck. The prince also looked at her and was about to depart in the other direction when a maidservant came there, carrying clothes, ornaments, betel nut, etc. She offered the prince the clothes and ornaments, saying, 'The one you saw here is our mistress. She sent me to you on the pretext of fulfilling a desire. And she has ordered me to take you to my father's minister's house as a guest. The true reality is known only to the mistress herself.'
Hearing this, the prince also went with the maidservant to the house of the Nagadeva minister. The minister also stood up to welcome the prince as soon as he arrived, as if he was already attracted to his qualities. The maidservant said to the minister, 'Princess Shrikant has sent this fortunate prince to stay at your place.' The maidservant delivered this message and left. The minister

The Tale of Brahmadatt Chakri

The second light of the Yoga Shastra, verse 28, welcomed the Kumar like a master. The whole night passed in the blink of an eye. Then the minister took the Kumar to the royal palace. There the king welcomed him with offerings like the rising sun. After that, the king gave him his daughter without asking about the Kumar's lineage. "From the appearance itself, one can know all the qualities of a man." The Kumar and the princess exchanged hands, signifying their love and devotion, and got married.

One day, while playing in private, Brahmadatt asked the princess, "My love! Why did your father give you to an unknown person like me without knowing my lineage?" Shrikant, with her beautiful teeth and clean lips, replied, "My love! In the city of Vasantpur, there was a king named Shabarasen. His son, along with cruel kings, dethroned my father. Since then, my father has taken refuge in this village with his army. Like a reed that is quickly broken, my father, living here, has supported the wild Bhils in robbing villages and sustaining his family. They have four sons, like the four ways to acquire wealth. After four sons, they had a very beloved daughter, that is me."

"As soon as I reached the threshold of youth, my father said to me, 'Daughter! All the kings have become my enemies. Therefore, you stay here and search for your husband. Tell me about the husband you like.' Since then, I have been living on the banks of the lake like a Chakri bird, watching many travelers coming and going on this path. The fulfillment of a cherished desire is rare even in dreams. But, Aryan son! By the strength of my destiny, you have arrived here. You know what happened after that."

One day, the king of the village went to loot a village. The Kumar also went with him, for this is the way of Kshatriyas. While the village was being looted, Vardhanu fell at the feet of Brahmadatt like a swan on the bank of the lake. Vardhanu embraced the Kumar and cried out loud. It is true that when you meet a loved one, all your sorrow comes out from within. The Kumar comforted him with sweet words like the nectar of immortality and asked him to tell him the whole story from beginning to end. Vardhanu began to speak, "Master! At that time, I was searching for water for you, leaving you under the banyan tree. I had just gone a little further when I saw a lake like a pool of nectar. I was bringing water for you in a lotus leaf cup from the lake when suddenly some warriors, dressed in armor like Yama's messengers, surrounded me and asked, 'Vardhanu! Tell the truth, where is Brahmadatt?' Understanding their intention, I said, 'I don't know.' As I said this, they started beating me mercilessly like a thief. I made up a story and said, 'A lion has already killed Brahmadatt.' They said, 'Then tell us where the lion killed him?' Then I wandered around, pretending to search for you, and came in front of you to signal you to escape. I told them that the lion had killed him right here. Then I put the magical pill given by the wanderer in my mouth, and under its influence, I became completely motionless and fainted. Thinking me dead, they left me there. After they left, I took the pill out of my mouth and started searching for you like someone searching for lost treasure. After wandering through many villages, I saw a wanderer, a great sage, who was the embodiment of penance. I bowed to him and sat down. He asked me, 'Vardhanu! I am Vasubhag, the friend of Dhanu. Tell me, where does Brahmadatt live on this earth?' Trusting him, I told him everything as it was. Hearing my sad story, he looked sad, like a face darkened by smoke. He told me that when the lac house was burnt to ashes, the king had inspected it in the morning and found one body. But the other two bodies were not found. But a tunnel was found there, at the end of which were the marks of a horse's feet. It is possible that they escaped with the help of Dhanu's intelligence. Knowing this, the king, enraged at the minister, ordered, 'Send the army, which moves like the rays of the sun, in every direction, so that they can find those two...'

The Story of Brahmadatta Chakri
- We have brought here the verse 27 of the second chapter of the Yogashastra. The minister of the bow managed to escape from there secretly. After his departure, your mother has been placed in a house in the neighborhood of the Chandala, who are like hell. Just as one pain follows another after a fever, similarly, on hearing this, my mind was filled with sorrow upon sorrow, and I, being distressed, went from there towards Kausambi. I disguised myself as a fake Kapaalika ascetic and entered the Chandala neighborhood. There, like a rabbit, I started searching for my mother by entering house to house. When the people asked me the reason for roaming in that neighborhood every day, I said - 'My Maatangi Vidya sadhana is such that I have to enter house to house in this way.' While wandering in this way, I became friends with a reliable police officer there. 'What work cannot be done by Maya?' One day, through that trusted police officer, I had my mother called and told her that 'Your son's friend, the great vrati Kundindya tapasvi, pays his respects to you.' My mother understood. The eager mother asked me to meet her to see her son. So, the next day I went there myself and gave my mother a betel-nut packet; as soon as she ate it, she became unconscious like a log. Seeing her in such a condition, the police officer told the king, 'Lord! The wife of the treasurer has died.' Hearing this, I also reached there immediately. I told the servants who had come to perform the cremation, 'Brothers! If you cremate her at this time, it will be a great misfortune for your king.' Hearing this, the royal servants left her there as she was. Then I told the police officer, 'If you help, I can accomplish a mantra with this all-characteristic word.' The police officer agreed to my request. I also took the mother away from the cremation ground at dusk. There, in a deceptive manner, I wrote a circular yantra and sent the police officer to offer it to the goddesses of the city. While he went there, I gave the mother another betel-nut; with which she regained consciousness and got up, as if waking up from sleep. I introduced myself to her. Hearing this, she started hiccupping. I comforted her and stopped her from crying. Then I took her to Kaccha village and left her with my father's friend Devasharmaa. After leaving her there, I have been wandering here and there to find you. By my good fortune, I have now had your darshan, which is like a heap of merit. Swamin! Now tell me, where did you go and where did you stay after being separated from me? And what happened where? The prince also narrated his Rama story.
From there, the two were walking together when someone came and said in a low voice, 'The soldiers of King Dirgharaja are roaming around the village, showing a picture (hooliya) of a person with a similar appearance as you, and asking if anyone has seen two such people.' Hearing their words, I have come to inform you both. Now do as you deem appropriate. Saying this, he left. Hearing this, the two companions fled into the forest like baby elephants and reached Kaushambi in a day. There, outside the city, in the garden, they saw Sagardatta and Buddhil making roosters fight for a bet of one lakh rupees. The roosters were fighting each other with their claws and beaks, like deadly weapons. In the fight, the strong rooster of superior breed, like Bhadrahasti, was defeated by the cunning rooster of Buddhil, like a medium-sized elephant. Seeing this, Vardhanu said, 'Sagar! Why did your superior breed rooster lose? If you want to know the reason, I will find it out.' With Sagar's consent, Vardhanu closely examined Buddhil's rooster and found a needle-like iron object stuck in its leg. Buddhil also realized that Vardhanu had discovered his deception; so he secretly offered 50,000 rupees in Vardhanu's ear. Vardhanu also told this matter in private to Brahmakumar. Brahmadatta secretly removed the iron needle stuck in the leg of Buddhil's rooster and made it fight again with Sagardatta's rooster. With the removal of the needle, Buddhil's rooster lost the battle in a short time. 'How can the victory of a deceitful person be possible?' Pleased with this, Sagardatta took the two princes in his chariot to his house. There, the two princes were warmly welcomed.

The Story of Brahmadatta Chakri
From the Yogashastra, Second Illumination, Verse 27

Brahmadatta began living like a member of the household. One day, the servant of Buddhil came to Vardhamana and whispered something in his ear. After the servant left, Vardhamana told Brahmadatta, "Brother! The other day, Buddhil had offered to give 50,000 rupees. Today, you should see that matter."

Thereafter, he showed the young prince a garland of large, shining pearls, radiant like the planet Venus. The prince saw the inscription of his name on the garland. Just then, a female ascetic named Vatsa appeared, as if the inscription had come to life. She blessed both of them by placing auspicious rice grains on their heads. Then, she took Vardhamana aside and whispered something to him. The minister's son told Brahmadatta that the ascetic was asking for a copy of the inscription on the garland, which Brahmadatta had given her.

I asked him, "Who is this Brahmadatta?" He replied, "She is the most excellent daughter of this city, Ratnawati, who has come in the form of Rati, the goddess of love, to this world. On the day of the cockfight between her brother Sagardatta and Buddhil, she saw Brahmadatta. Since then, she has been afflicted by the fever of love. She is unable to find any peace and is becoming thinner day by day. Day and night, she keeps repeating, 'I seek refuge in Brahmadatta.'"

One day, she wrote a letter with her own hand, asking me to send the garland to Brahmadatta. I had the servant deliver that letter. Saying this, he stood there. In response, I wrote a letter and instructed her to leave. From that day, Brahmadatta, the young prince, also began to suffer from the unbearable torment of love, like an elephant scorched by the intense rays of the midday sun. Indeed, a person afflicted by the fever of love cannot experience happiness.

On the other hand, the king's servants, who were sent by the long-lived king, had searched the entire city of Kaushambi. They were now running here and there, like sharp thorns embedded in the body, in search of these two. On the order of the king of Kaushambi, the search for them began in the city. Then, the merchant Sagardatta hid them in the secret chamber of his house and protected them. At night, when they wanted to go out, Sagardatta accompanied them in a chariot for some distance and then returned.

After Sagardatta left, as they proceeded further, they saw a beautiful woman sitting in a chariot, yoked with horses, in a garden, like the goddess of the Nandana grove. She politely asked them, "Why did it take you so long?" They also asked her, "Dear lady, how do you know us? Do you know who we are?"

She replied, "In this city, there is a very wealthy merchant named Dhanapravara, who is like the second brother of Kubera. I am his daughter, Vivekashri, who has the eight qualities of intelligence, like the supreme discernment. As soon as I attained youth, I performed intense worship of the Yaksha presiding over this garden, as I desired to obtain an excellent husband. Most women have no other ambition besides this. Pleased by my devotion, the chief Yaksha granted the boon, 'Brahmadatta Chakravarti will be your husband.' He also said that the person with the Shrivatsalakshana, who will come with his friend in the cockfight between Sagardatta and Buddhil's cocks, you should consider him as your husband. When Brahmadatta will be in my Yaksha shrine, then your first meeting with him will occur. So, O beautiful one, I have understood that you are the one. Therefore, now you may come. Just as water contact brings peace to a person afflicted by heat, in the same way, your union will bring peace to me, who has been tormented by the pain of separation for a long time."

"Very well, so be it," said the prince, accepting that devoted woman. At her request, both of them sat in her chariot. When asked, "Where should we go?" the beautiful woman said, "To Magadhapur, where my cousin brother Dhanawaha lives. He will honor us greatly. So it is good to go there."

Saying this, the minister's son, acting as the charioteer, turned the horses in that direction. As soon as Brahmadatta crossed Kaushambi and entered a dreadful forest, like the playground of Yama, he saw two terrible bandit commanders named Sankatakaand Kantaka in front of him. Just as dogs stop a wild boar, they stopped Brahmadatta. And those two brothers, like the sons of the Night Goddess, became suddenly excited and showered arrows on Brahmadatta with his army. The entire sky was covered with arrows. The prince also took up his bow and arrows, roaring like a lion, and unleashed a continuous stream of arrows, destroying the bandit army.

The Story of Brahmadutt Chakri
The Yogashastra, Second Illumination, Verse 27, has been paralyzed, just as a cloud paralyzes fire. The shower of arrows released by the prince has scattered both the enemy commanders and their army. When a lion is ready to attack, how can a deer stand its ground? The minister's son said to the prince, "Your Highness, you must be very tired from the battle. So, rest here on this chariot for a while." Just as an elephant sleeps with a young female elephant in the valley of a mountain, Brahmadutt too slept on the chariot with Ratnawati.

After some time, when the prince woke up, he did not see the charioteer, the minister's son. Thinking he must have gone to fetch water, the prince called out for a long time, but received no response. Seeing the front part of the chariot soaked in blood, the prince suddenly cried out, "Alas, I am killed!" Lamenting thus, he fainted and fell into the chariot. When he regained consciousness after some time, he stood up. Then, remembering something, he began to sob like an ordinary person. "Friend Vardhana! Alas! Where have you gone, leaving me behind!" In this way, he started lamenting. Ratnawati consoled him, saying, "I don't think your friend has died. Therefore, my lord, it is not appropriate to speak such inauspicious words for him. He must have gone somewhere for your work. It is certain that sometimes servants go without being asked, for the sake of their master's work. My heart says that he is safe under the influence of your devotion and will surely return. The influence of devotion to the master is such that it acts as a shield for the servants. Upon reaching the place, we will have the servants search for him. Now, it is not right to linger even for a moment in this terrible forest like Yama."

Reassured by Ratnawati's words, the prince urged the horses forward, and they reached a village on the border of the Magadha kingdom. The village headman, sitting in his home, saw them approaching and warmly welcomed them to his house. When the prince had somewhat recovered, the village headman asked him, "Your face suggests that you are in sorrow. If there is no objection, please tell me the reason for your concern." The prince said, "While fighting with the thieves, my friend has disappeared, and I am unable to find him." Thereupon, the headman said, "Just as Hanuman found Sita, we too will search and bring him back." Saying this, the headman, along with the villagers, thoroughly searched the entire forest, but could not find any trace of him. Returning, the village leader said, "No one injured by an attack was seen in this great forest; however, this one arrow was found there. It seems that Vardhana has surely died."

Hearing this, Brahmadutt sank deeper into the darkness of sorrow. Soon, the arrival of night made that darkness of sorrow even more palpable. In the fourth watch of the night, thieves suddenly attacked the place. But on being challenged by the prince, they all fled in the opposite direction. Then, following the guidance of the village leader, the prince and Ratnawati reached Rajgriha. There, the prince left Ratnawati at the hermitage of an ascetic outside the city and entered the city. As soon as he entered the city, he saw two young, beautiful women standing at the palace window, as if they were personifications of Rati and Priti. They said to the prince, "Prince, is it proper for you to leave the company of those devoted to love?" The prince asked, "Who are these devoted to love, and when have I abandoned them?" Welcoming him, they said, "Lord, please come here and rest. Are you not pleased?" Entertaining him with sweet words, they took Brahmadutt into their home. After bathing him and feeding him, they began to narrate their true story:

"In the southern range of the Vaitadhya mountain, which is like the tilaka mark on the earth made of golden rock and is endowed with the abodes of the Vidyadharas, there is a city named Shivamandira. In that city, there was a king named Jwalanashikha, who had a radiant, lightning-like wife named Vidhushikha. After their son Natyonmatta, we two, Khanda and Vishakha, were born as their beloved daughters. Once, our father, along with his friend Agnishikha and all of us, had gone to..."

The Tale of Brahmadatt Chakri

Taking the second light of Yoga Shastra, verse 27, they set out on a pilgrimage. One should engage loved ones in religious work. We reached the Ashtapad mountain from there. There we saw the images of the Tirthankaras, made of precious gems, with their characteristic colors, and after performing the proper abhisheka, vilepana, and puja, we circumambulated them and with a focused mind, we offered our devotional obeisance to the chaitya. As we were leaving from there, we saw two charanmunis under a blood-red tree; they seemed to be embodiments of penance and tranquility. After paying our respects to them, we listened with reverence to their dharmadeshana, which was like the moon's light, dispelling the darkness of our ignorance. After that, Agnishikha asked the munis, "Who will be the husbands of these two girls?" They said, "Whoever kills their brother will be their husbands." Hearing this, our faces turned pale, as if the moon loses its luster in the snow. Then, with words filled with detachment, we said to our father, "Father! Just today you taught us about the futility of the world, and today you are so overwhelmed by the poison of sorrow? What is the benefit of drowning in such worldly pleasures?" From then on, we all took care to protect our brother. Once, while wandering, our brother saw your maternal uncle Pushpachala's daughter, Pushpavati. He was captivated by her extraordinary beauty. Then, in his foolishness, he forcibly abducted her. "The mind always follows actions." Unable to bear the sight of the girl, he went to acquire knowledge. You know the rest of the story. At that time, Pushpavati spoke of dharma to alleviate our brother's grief over his death, and also told us that your beloved Brahmadatt was here. The words of a muni are never false. We accepted that. But in our haste, Pushpavati waved a white flag instead of a red one, causing you to leave us. Due to the adversity of our fate, you did not come. We searched for you there a lot, but you were nowhere to be seen. Finally, defeated and exhausted, we returned here. By our good fortune, you have arrived here. According to Pushpavati's statement, we have already accepted you. Therefore, you are now the only hope for both of us. Knowing the two women's devotion, the Kumar performed a Gandharva marriage with them. Just as rivers love to merge with the ocean, so do women love to be united with their husbands. Just as Mahadev used to play with Ganga and Parvati, Brahmadatt spent that night playing with those two beautiful women. In the morning, as the Kumar was leaving, he lovingly instructed them, "Until I get my kingdom, you two should stay with Pushpavati." Both of them obeyed the Kumar's command. As soon as the Kumar left from there, that temple and house, and everything else, became invisible, like Gandharvanagar. Returning from there, Brahmadatt went to that tapas-ashram to search for Ratnavati. But not finding her there, he asked a man standing there, who had a good appearance, "Great one! Have you seen a woman wearing divine clothes, adorned with jewels, today or yesterday?" He replied, "Yes, great one! Yesterday I saw a woman crying and lamenting, saying, 'Oh, my lord!' But her uncle recognized her and took her with him." Brahmadatt found out about Ratnavati's uncle and called him to his place. For those who are blessed with great fortune, everything seems new. He spent a lot of time experiencing worldly pleasures with her. One day, the Kumar began the post-death rituals for Vardhanu. The next day, the Kumar was feeding the Brahmanas when a man dressed as a Brahmana, who looked like Vardhanu, came there and said, "If you give me food, you will be giving it to Vardhanu himself." The Brahmaputra heard these sweet words, which were like nectar to his ears, and looked at him carefully from head to toe, embracing him as if he had made his soul his own. Then, with joy, he bathed him and took him home. When the Kumar asked him about his story after he recovered, he said, "After you went to sleep, thieves who looked like soldiers of Dirgharaja surrounded me. A thief hiding among the trees there shot an arrow with such force that I was wounded and fell to the ground. When I regained consciousness, I slowly crawled away and hid among the vines.

The Tale of Brahmadatt Chakra

Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 27

In the midst of it, I hid myself. After the thieves left, I hid in the hollow of the tree, like a water bird hides in water. When silence fell all around, I reached the village with great difficulty, looking here and there. After learning your news from the headman of the village, I came here searching. Just as the peacock is delighted to see the clouds, so I am overjoyed to see you. Brahmadatt, expressing great joy, said to him, "When will we become cowardly and inactive?"

During that time, the spring festival, which bestows dominion upon Kamadeva and intoxicates young men like wine, arrived. Then, the king, the brother of Yama Raja, like a drunken elephant, broke the pillar, freed from his chains, and went out, terrifying everyone. A young woman, staggering under the weight of her hips, was going on the highway, when the elephant picked her up in its trunk like a lotus. Helpless, weeping, she began to lament pitifully, "Oh Matanga, oh Matanga! (meaning your Matanga - (Chandala) name is meaningful) Are you not ashamed to catch a helpless woman?" Hearing this, the Kumar came forward to rescue her from the elephant's clutches. The Kumar jumped up and placed his foot on the elephant's tusk, like placing his foot on a ladder, and easily climbed onto the elephant's back. And there he sat down comfortably. Just as a yogi subdues his senses and mind through yogic power, so the Kumar subdued the elephant with the reins of his voice and the pressure of his feet. The spectators standing there exclaimed, "Bravo! Bravo! Well done! Well done!" Thus, everyone began to cheer for the Kumar. The Kumar also took the elephant to the pillar and tied it like a female elephant. When the king heard this, he immediately came to the scene and, looking at the Kumar with astonished eyes, said, "Who is not amazed by his form and prowess? Who is this powerful man in disguise? Where did he come from? Or is he the sun or Indra?" Hearing this, Ratnawati told the king the whole story. Attracted by the qualities of the Kumar, the fortunate king gave him his daughters in a festive manner, just as Daksha Raja had given them to Chandra. After marrying the princesses, the Kumar stayed there happily. One day, an old woman, with one end of her garment trailing behind her, came to the Kumar and said, "In this city, there lives a wealthy Seth named Vaishramana, who is as wealthy as any other money-lender on earth. He has a daughter named Shrimati, like the Lakshmi born from the ocean. On the day you rescued her from the elephant's clutches, like the moon from the clutches of Rahu, she has accepted you as her husband in her heart. Since then, she has been restless and thin in your memory. Just as she has taken you into her heart, so you should take her by the hand." At the old woman's repeated request, the Kumar agreed. Thereafter, with great pomp and ceremony, with music and various auspicious events, the Kumar married Shrimati. At the same time, Vardhanu married Nanda, the daughter of the wise minister. In this way, gaining fame throughout the country and abroad through their prowess and engaging in charity, they both continued to progress.

Hearing that Brahmadatt was coming towards Varanasi, the king of Varanasi, knowing his glory like that of Katik Brahma, went to meet him and brought him to his place with festivities. Attracted by Brahmadatt's qualities, the king gave him his daughter, Katikavati, and as dowry, a four-armed army, like Jayalakshmi herself. In this way, kings like Karunudatt of Champanagari, Dhanumantri, and Bhagadatt, hearing of his arrival, came to welcome him. Just as Bharat Chakravarti had made Sushen his commander-in-chief, so Brahmadatt made Vardhanu his commander-in-chief and marched with him to make Dirghraja a guest of the other world. During this time, a messenger of Dirghraja came to Katik Raja and said, "It is not right for you to abandon the friendship you have had with Dirghraja since childhood." To this, Katik Raja said, "We five brothers, including Brahmaraja, were like brothers. At the time of Brahmaraja's death, Dirghraja was entrusted with the responsibility of protecting his son and kingdom. But he did not consider the future of Brahmaraja's son with foresight, nor did he consider his kingdom. On the contrary, he has become corrupt and committed so many sins that one

The Tale of Brahmadatt Chakra

Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 27 | Even a Chandala would not do this. Therefore, go and tell Dirgharaja that Brahmadatt is coming, either fight him or flee from here with your black face. Saying this, he sent the messenger back. Thereafter, Brahmadatt advanced with unimpeded speed. Reaching Kampilya, he surrounded the entire city, including Dirgharaja, just as clouds cover the sky along with the sun. Just as a great serpent emerges from a hole when a stick is struck on it, Dirgharaja emerged from the city with all his family and war materials. On the other hand, Chulani Rani, having become extremely detached from the world, took initiation from a Pravartini Sadhvi named Purnā and gradually became eligible for liberation. Just as aquatic creatures of a river clash with those of the sea, so too did Dirgharaja's soldiers clash with Brahmadatt's soldiers. Many of Dirgharaja's soldiers fell wounded. Then Dirgharaja himself, grinding his teeth in anger, with a terrifying countenance like a boar, rushed to kill the enemy. But Brahmadatt's infantry, chariot force, and cavalry spread out rapidly like the swift current of a river. After that, Brahmadatt also, with red eyes in anger, roared like an elephant and clashed with Dirgharaja himself. Like the waves of the ocean during the time of destruction, they both attacked each other with weapons. In the meantime, knowing that the opportunity had come, a Chakra Ratna, shining like a servant, all-conquering, appeared in the service of Brahmadatt. Brahmadatt immediately used that Chakra Ratna to finish off Dirgharaja. What effort does lightning need to kill a gnat? Does it take time? The gods, praising him like the Magadhas, showered flowers on him, saying, "Victory to Brahmadatt Chakravarti!" The citizens began to see Brahmadatt as their father, mother, or deity. Just as Indra enters Amaravati, so too did he enter Kampilya. Upon ascending the throne, King Brahmadatt summoned all his wives from all places, with whom he had married in the past; and among them, he established Pushpavati as the "Strirata." Then, conquering the six continents with different boundaries of ownership, Brahmadatt made the earth into one continent. That is, he established a single-umbrella Chakravarti kingdom. For twelve consecutive years, kings from all directions came and performed his coronation, just as they had done for Bharata. He married sixty-four thousand women and kept them in his inner palace. Thus, Brahmadatt Chakravarti was enjoying all the pleasures of the kingdom as the fruit of the tree of penance performed in his previous birth. One day, there was a play, music, dance, and melody in the palace; in the meantime, one of his maidservants presented Brahmadatt with a wonderful bunch of flowers woven by the celestial nymphs. Brahmadatt looked at it intently and began to think, "I have seen such a bunch of flowers somewhere before." Pondering repeatedly in his mind, he remembered his five previous births. Then he remembered that he had seen such a bunch in the Saudharma Devaloka. The intense recollection of his brother, who had been with him in his five previous births, made the king impatient. He fainted and fell down with a thud. Seeing the Chakravarti in this state, they sprinkled sandalwood water on him; from which he regained consciousness. Upon recovering, he began to think, "How and where will I find my brother from my previous birth? To recognize him, I will give the servant half a verse, the identifier of my previous birth, 'Aasva Dasau Mrigao Hansi, Matangavamarau Tatha.' He also had a proclamation made in the city, "Whoever completes this half-verse of mine, I will give him half my kingdom." Hearing this announcement, the people of the city became very curious to know this half-verse. Everyone memorized it almost as if it were their own name. But no one could fulfill the problem of the meaning of the verse. At that time, Purimatal was born in the city of Chitrak as the son of a Seth. He had the knowledge of jati-smriti. Therefore, he took initiation and wandered from village to village. 1. One story describes Chulani fleeing and taking initiation from a Sadhvi on the way.

The Story of Chakravarti Brahmadatt

Chapter Two, Light of Yoga, Verse 27: One day, while wandering, Chitramuni arrived at a place. He stayed in a garden, in a beautiful and peaceful spot. One day, the Muni heard half a verse, which fulfilled a problem, from the mouth of a person playing a rehat (a type of musical instrument). Upon hearing it, he spoke the other half of the verse: "Esha no shashtikajaatiranyo'nyabhyam viyuktayoḥ." The rehat player memorized the half verse and went straight to the king, reciting it to him. Upon hearing it, the king asked, "Who is the poet who composed this verse?" He told the king the Muni's name. The king rewarded him greatly and sent him away. Now, the king went to see the Muni, who was like a Kalpavriksha (wish-fulfilling tree) growing in that garden. With tears of joy in his eyes, the king bowed to the Muni and sat down near him, filled with affection, as in past lives. The Muni, an ocean of compassion, blessed the king with the gift of Dharma and gave him beneficial Dharma-upadesha (religious teachings).

"O King! There is nothing substantial in this impermanent world. If there is anything substantial, it is Dharma, like a lotus in the mud, in the mud of this world. Body, youth, wealth, ownership, friends, and relatives - all these are as fickle as a flag fluttering in the wind. Just as a Chakravarti conquers all external enemies to achieve victory over the six continents of the earth, so too, conquer your internal enemies to achieve liberation. Discriminate between external and internal enemies, and abandon the internal enemies, who are like great enemies. Just as a Rajahansa (swan) separates milk from water (discrimination), so too, discriminate between the essential and the non-essential and embrace the path of a Yati (ascetic). Brahmadatt said, "O Master! Today, I am fortunate to have your darshan (vision). Take this entire kingdom. Enjoy it as you wish. You have received the fruits of your austerities; enjoy them. When the fruits of austerity are obtained, why perform further austerities? Who undertakes another endeavor when the purpose is fulfilled? The Muni said, "I too had wealth like Kubera (the god of wealth). But fearing the cycle of birth and death, I abandoned it like a blade of grass. You have come down to earth from the Saudharma heaven, where your merit has been exhausted. Therefore, O King! Do not fall into the lower realms of hell from here. You have been born into a noble family in Aryadesha (land of the Aryans) and have obtained the human form, which grants liberation. Yet, you are engaged in the pursuit of worldly pleasures in this life, which is like cleansing the anus with nectar. We have fallen from heaven and wandered through various lower births due to our depleted merit. Remembering this, why are you still clinging to the worldly maze like a foolish child?" In this way, Chitramuni gave much advice to the Chakravarti, but he could not understand. Indeed, how can one who is attached to worldly pleasures attain the seed of enlightenment? Finally, when the Muni realized that the king would never understand, he left for another place. What power can Garuda (the eagle) have over a snake that has been bitten by a venomous snake? The Muni, through the practice of austerity and self-control, destroyed his karmas (actions) and attained the supreme knowledge of Kevala Jnana (omniscience). He also destroyed the four destructive karmas and attained liberation.

Brahmadatt, immersed in the enjoyment of worldly pleasures, had spent seven hundred years. During this time, a familiar Brahmin came to him. He said to the Chakravarti, "O King! Give me some of the food you eat." Brahmadatt said, "You do not have the capacity to digest my food. It takes a long time to digest and is very intoxicating." Then he said, "It seems you are also miserly in giving food to a Brahmin. Shame on you!" Then the Chakravarti, along with his family, made the Brahmin eat his food. Due to its influence, a thousand-branched tree of lust arose in the Brahmin's mind that night. As a result, he spent the whole night indulging in sexual activity, not even distinguishing between his mother, sister, daughter, and daughter-in-law, behaving like an animal. As the night passed, the Brahmin and his family could not face each other out of shame. The Brahmin thought, "The wicked king has put me and my family in a terrible situation." Therefore, filled with anger, he left the city. While wandering in the forest, he saw a shepherd from a distance, throwing pebbles with a slingshot and piercing peepal leaves. He immediately realized, "This is the right way to take revenge on that wicked king." The Brahmin gave him very valuable goods.

The Condition of the Violent One

From the 28th and 29th verses of the second canto of the Yogashastra, and after honoring him with wealth, it was said - 'Now, you must definitely do one task for me. Whoever comes riding an elephant with a parasol and a chowrie, shoot out both his eyes with a slingshot.' The shepherd accepted the Brahmin's words. Because animal-keepers do not act thoughtfully like animals. The shepherd was lying in wait. Just then, the king's procession arrived. The shepherd stood between two walls, took aim, and fired two whizzing bullets, which gouged out both the king's eyes. Truly, the command of the gods is inviolable. Like a hawk catching a crow, the king's soldiers immediately seized that shepherd. After being severely beaten, he revealed the name of the Brahmin who had instigated this unpleasant act. Hearing this, the enraged king said, "Fie on the Brahmin caste! These sinful ones break the very vessels from which they eat. Even a dog is better, for it shows gratitude and devotion to its benefactor upon receiving something. It is never appropriate to give to such ungrateful Brahmins. The cruel, violent, meat-eating Brahmins, who deceive others, should be punished first."

Saying this, the extremely enraged king had that Brahmin, along with his son, friend, and kinsmen, killed like mosquitoes caught in the fist. Thereafter, with eyes blinded and heart blinded by anger, that emperor eliminated all the innocent Brahmins, including the priests. Then he ordered the minister, "Kill Brahmins daily and present before me the plate filled with the eyes of those injured Brahmins."

Knowing the king's fierce determination, the wise minister would daily fill a plate with the seeds of the lassora fruit and present it before the king, saying, "This plate is filled with the eyes of the Brahmins." Hearing this, the king would pounce on the so-called eyes kept in the plate and knead them repeatedly with both hands. Now, Brahmadatta did not derive as much pleasure from the touch of the jewel-like woman Pushpavati as he did from the touch of those so-called eyes in the plate. Just as a drunkard does not leave the cup of liquor, similarly, Brahmadatta never kept that plate, the cause of his downfall, away from his sight. The blind Brahmadatta would daily, like phlegm, crush the large lassora fruits, thinking them to be the eyes of the Brahmins, as if cultivating the seedling of the tree of sin facing him. Due to the continuous perpetration of this cruel act, the intensity of his malevolent meditation increased day by day. "Whether the karmic bond is auspicious or inauspicious, it only grows larger with each day's contemplation of it." By this principle, Brahmadatta, the emperor, trapped in the mire of sin like a pig, spent sixteen years binding karma through the continuum of his malevolent meditation. Thus, having completed a total lifespan of seven hundred and sixteen years, in accordance with the fruit of his violent conduct, Brahmadatta became a guest of the seventh hell.

They criticize the one who commits violence. A lame, crippled, or deformed person is better, even if he has a complete body, than one who is devoted to violence.

The violence done even for the sake of removing an obstacle is itself an obstacle. And the violence done out of family tradition is also destructive to the family.

##  The Abandonment of Violence Rooted in Family Tradition by Sulas

**Chapter 2: Light of Yoga, Verse 30**

Obstacles that are not overcome become severe obstacles instead of peace. As narrated in the Samradditya story, Surendradatt, a being of Yashodhar, created a dough bird and killed it for peace from obstacles. This act of killing became an obstacle for him in the form of an increase in the cycle of birth and death. Similarly, violence committed with the mindset of "This is our family tradition or custom" is also destructive to the family. ||29||

How does one become praiseworthy by abandoning violence rooted in family tradition? This is explained in the following verse. ||86||

**Verse 30:**

Even if violence is passed down through generations, one who abandons it becomes a great man like Sulas, the son of the butcher. ||30||

**Explanation:**

One who abandons violence passed down through generations, becomes great and praiseworthy like Sulas, the son of the butcher. Sulas was well aware of the path to liberation. He was willing to die himself, but he would not harm others, not even in his mind.

**The story of Sulas, accessible to all:**

In those days, Rajagriha in Magadha was a prosperous city. There, King Shrenik, a devotee of the Lord Mahavira, ruled. Just as Krishna's father Vasudeva had Devaki and Rohini as queens, Shrenik had two beloved queens, Nanda and Chelna, adorned with virtues. Nanda, like the moon, brought joy to her husband, and she had a son, a gem of the family, named Abhaykumar. Recognizing his son's excellent intellect and skills, the king bestowed upon him all the rights and responsibilities. Indeed, virtues are the source of honor.

Once, Lord Mahavira arrived in Rajagriha. Knowing that the Lord, like a wish-fulfilling tree, had arrived, King Shrenik, feeling blessed and overjoyed, went to see him. There, in the assembly filled with gods, humans, and other beings, the king sat in his rightful place. The world teacher, Mahavira, began to preach the Dharma that destroys sins. At that very moment, a leper, whose body was oozing pus, entered the assembly. He bowed to the Lord and sat near him, like a mad dog, and began to smear his pus on the Lord's feet, as if it were sandalwood paste. Seeing this, King Shrenik, inwardly agitated, thought to himself, "This sinner, who has dared to defile the world teacher, deserves to be killed as soon as he gets up." At that moment, the Lord sneezed, and the leper said, "May you die!" Then Shrenik sneezed, and he said, "May you live!" Then Abhaykumar sneezed, and the leper said, "May you live or die." Finally, when the butcher sneezed, the leper said, "May you neither live nor die."

Angered by the leper's disrespectful words to the Lord, the king ordered his soldiers to capture him as soon as he got up.

After the sermon was over, the leper bowed to the Lord and stood up. The king's soldiers immediately captured him, just as hunters surround a boar. The leper, radiant like the sun, disappeared into the sky in an instant, before everyone's eyes. The royal servants informed the king. The king, astonished, asked the Lord, "Lord, who was that person who disappeared in an instant before our very eyes?" The Lord said, "This is a god."

Shrenik asked again, "Lord, if he is a god, why did he come in the form of a leper?" The Lord replied, "King, listen. In the city of Kaushambi in the country of Vatsa, King Shatanik ruled. In that city lived a poor and foolish Brahmin named Seduk. One day, his pregnant wife said to him, "There is only a little time left.

The Story of Sulas

"The second light of the Yoga Shastra, verse 30 is about to happen, so please bring me ghee. Otherwise, I will not be able to bear this labor pain." Upon this, the Brahmin said, "My dear, I do not have any knowledge or skill; by which I can go anywhere and get ghee. Respected people get everything through skill." Then the Brahmin woman said, "My lord! You serve the king. On this earth, the king is the second Kalpavriksha." Just as people serve the ocean to obtain gems, so too did the Brahmin, following her words, begin to serve the king with fruits, flowers, etc. Just as the clouds of the rainy season engulf the sky, one day the king of Champapuri, with a great army, besieged Kaushambi. Like a snake sitting in a bamboo, waiting for time, so too was Shatanik, with his army, waiting for time in Kaushambi. When much time had passed, Shatanik's soldiers, like royal swans, became bored and began to leave from there. One day, Seduk went to the garden early in the morning to pick flowers. Then he saw the soldiers and the king's faces, dull like extinguished stars. At that time, he came to King Shatanik and requested, "O King! Your enemy, like a snake with broken teeth, has become impotent, so if you fight with him today, you will be able to capture him effortlessly. No matter how strong a person is, after being dejected, he cannot fight with the enemy." Accepting his words, the king, with his vast army and resources, marched out of his camp, showering arrows. Seeing the sudden attack of the king of Champa, the army of Champa fled without looking back. Truly, who can look towards lightning when it strikes suddenly? "In which direction should I go?" With this thought, the king of Champa, bewildered, fled alone to save his life. Before the king of Champa fled, his army had already been thrown into disarray. Therefore, seeing the opportunity, the king of Kaushambi looted a lot of goods, including the king of Champa's elephants, horses, chariots, and treasury, and took them into his possession. Later, the victorious Shatanik, filled with joy, entered Kaushambi with his army.

The victorious king, pleased, said to Seduk Brahmin, "O Vipra! Tell me, what should I give you?" He said, "I will ask you for sufficient things after consulting my family members!" A householder cannot think for himself without his wife. Bhatt, happy, went to Bhattin and told her everything. Upon this, the wise Brahmin woman thought back and forth, "If I tell him to ask the king for a village, etc., then if he gets a village, etc., he might get married again. Because wealth is the generator of ego. Therefore, it would be right if we were given food from each house in the Chakravarti's kingdom, one after the other, every day, and a golden coin as Dakshina." Thinking thus, she told her husband. The Brahmin also made the same request to the king. The king accepted the Brahmin's request. Even after getting the ocean, one takes water according to one's need. Similarly, the Brahmin did. Now the Brahmin received food, Dakshina, and respect every day. Royal favor enhances a person's glory. People, considering that Brahmin to be a royal favorite, began to invite him. Who does not serve the king? Now the Brahmin received invitations from many houses, so he became a glutton, first vomiting what he had eaten and then going to eat at the houses from which he had received invitations. Because the more houses he ate in, the more houses he received Dakshina from. Shame on such greed of a Brahmin. Due to receiving Dakshina repeatedly, the Brahmin became very wealthy. Just as the banyan tree expands more and more with its roots, branches, and sub-branches, so too did Seduk become a large family with sons and grandsons. Along with this, due to daily indigestion, vomiting, and the food not being digested in his body, the Brahmin developed skin disease. Due to which he looked as if lac had been applied to a brass tree. Still, Seduk, insatiable like fire, went to eat as usual, according to the king's order, and took Dakshina. Gradually, Seduk developed leprosy, his hands, feet, nose, etc., rotted. One day, the minister requested the king, "O Dev! This Brahmin has leprosy, and it is a contagious disease, so it is not right to feed him. Instead, let one of his healthy sons be fed. A broken statue of

The Story of Sulas

In the second chapter of the Yoga Shastra, verse 30, it is stated that a second image is established. The king accepted the minister's suggestion and replaced Seduk with his son. Seduk now stayed at home, surrounded by flies like bees around a honeycomb. His sons built a hut outside the house and kept Seduk there. No one listened to him or followed his instructions. He was even fed in a wooden bowl like a dog. His daughters-in-law despised him, turning their faces away and wrinkling their noses when feeding him. Seeing this, the petty Seduk thought, "I made these sons wealthy, but today they have disregarded me and abandoned me like a traveler leaves his boat after crossing the sea. They don't even fulfill their promises. Instead, they taunt and mock me with inappropriate words like 'leper,' 'angry,' 'dissatisfied,' 'unworthy,' etc. Just as they despise me, they should become objects of hatred too." An idea suddenly struck him, and he was secretly pleased. He called his sons and said, "Sons, I am tired of this life. Our family tradition is that when someone wishes to die, their family brings them a magical animal. So, bring me an animal." Hearing this, they all agreed, and the sons, who were all wise in animal matters, brought their father a beast. Seduk, happy, took the pus oozing from his body and mixed it with the animal's food, feeding it to the beast. The animal, eating the pus-laced food, also became a leper. Seduk then gave the animal to his sons for sacrifice (slaughter). Not understanding their father's intention, the innocent sons killed the animal one day and ate its flesh. Meanwhile, Seduk told his sons, "I am going to a holy place for self-improvement. The forest is now my refuge." With a haughty air and a thoughtful expression, he set off. While walking through the jungle, he became very thirsty. Searching for water, he saw a lake, a friend-like body of water surrounded by various trees. The lake's water was tasteless due to fallen leaves, flowers, and fruits from the trees, and it was as hot as a decoction due to the midday sun's scorching rays. He drank the hot water. As he drank, his thirst increased. Every time he drank this hot water, he had diarrhea, and worms came out of his body. In this way, drinking the lake's water daily and passing worms with his excrement, Seduk was cured of his illness within a few days. His entire body became beautiful, like a tree in spring, beautiful in all its parts. Delighted with his recovery, the Brahmin set off for home. A beautiful body is a special adornment for all men in their birthplace.

When Seduk entered his city, the citizens were amazed to see him cured and beautiful, like a snake with a jeweled hood. They asked, "O learned Brahmin! Seeing your healthy body and beautiful form, it seems you have been reborn! What caused you to become healthy and beautiful?" The Brahmin said, "I worshipped the gods, and that is how I was cured." He then reached his home. Seeing his sons as lepers, he was delighted and said, "You disobeyed me, and you have received the fruits of your actions." His sons said, "Father, we trusted you, but why did you act so cruelly towards us, like an enemy?" Hearing this, Seduk was silent. The boys did not give him any respect, nor did anyone else. He became despised and without refuge.

After telling this entire story, Lord Mahavira continued, "O King Shrenik! That wandering Seduk came to your city and met your palace guards. When the guards heard that I was in Rajgriha, they were delighted and, to hear my Dharmadeshana, they left the Brahmin at his post and came to me. Thus, Seduk, like the door to livelihood, received the shelter of the guards. He sat hungry and thirsty at the gate. At that moment, seeing the birds eating the offered sacrifice at the gate, he pounced on it like a hungry wolf. Leprosy...

The Story of Sulasa

After being freed from the second light of the Yoga Shastra, verse 30, Sulasa's hunger increased greatly. Due to this, he ate greedily, stuffing himself to the brim. Just as a traveler in the desert feels extreme thirst in the summer, so too did Sulasa feel intense thirst after overeating. He was writhing in agony from thirst. Yet, out of fear of the gatekeeper, he did not leave that place to go towards any water source or reservoir. Instead, he remained there, suffering greatly from thirst, and in his mind, he began to praise aquatic creatures. Due to unbearable thirst, he cried out, "Water! Water!" and died right there. After death, he was born as a frog in the well near the gate of the same city. We were traveling and came to this city again. Therefore, people began to come very quickly to pay their respects. Hearing the news of my arrival from the news carriers, the frog began to think, "I have heard this before." Pondering over this repeatedly, he attained jati-smriti-jnana (knowledge of past lives) like remembering dreams. In the light of this knowledge, the frog realized that the same Prabhu whom the gatekeeper had been appointed to pay respects to in his previous life had arrived here. Therefore, just as humans go to pay their respects to him, so too should I. The water of the Ganges River is public. It does not have a single owner." Thinking this, he was hopping from there to pay his respects to me when he was crushed by the hoof of your horse's foot on the way and died right there. But at the time of his death, he had devotion and affection for me in his mind, so he was born as the Darduraank Dev.

"Even if a feeling is devoid of action, it is still fruitful." Devendra had said one day in the divine assembly, "In Bharatavarsha, King Shrenik is the best among the Shravakas and is steadfast in his faith. Therefore, O King! This Darduraank Dev has come to test you. He worshipped my feet with Gosirsha Chandan. To create an illusion in your mind, he used his Vaikriya Shakti to take the form of a leper, etc., and pretended to apply pus to my feet, and he spoke four different things to each of the four."

Upon this, King Shrenik asked the Lord again, "O Lord! When you sneezed, why did he speak a completely inauspicious word, and when others sneezed, why did he speak auspicious and inauspicious words?" In reply, the Lord said, "For me, his indication was that why are you still sitting in the world? Quickly depart for liberation. Therefore, he said to me, 'Die.' And O Narasimha! You have happiness here, but after death, your fate is hell, where there is immense suffering. As an indication of this, he said, 'Live.' For Abhayakumar, the difference was, 'Live or die.' He said this from the perspective that if he lives, he will perform righteous actions, and if he dies, he will go to the Anuttaraviman Devaloka. And finally, for Kalasaukarak, he said, 'Neither live nor die.' His intention was that if he lives, he will continue to kill many beings, and if he dies, he will go to the seventh hell."

Hearing this explanation from the Lord's mouth, Emperor Shrenik bowed and prayed, "O Lord! Even though you are such a gracious Lord, I will have to go to hell." The Lord said, "You have already bound the lifespan of hell for yourself. Therefore, you will definitely have to go there." "The fruits of past bound good or bad deeds must be experienced. We are all powerless to change anything in this. But the good news is that you will become the first Tirthankara named Padma-nabha in the coming twenty-four. Therefore, do not be sad."

Shrenik then asked, "O Lord! Is there any way for me to escape the terrible, darkest hell, which is like a blind man in a blind well?" The Lord replied, "Yes! There are two ways." One is that if you willingly make a donation to a Sadhu from the hands of your maidservant Kapila (Brahmani), and the other is that you stop Kalasaukarak (the butcher) from killing beings, then you can be freed from hell. Otherwise, it is very difficult.

Holding this righteous advice in his heart like a garland, King Shrenik bowed to Lord Mahavira and went towards his palace. On the way, to test the king's right faith, Darduraank Dev, carrying a net on his shoulder like a fisherman, 1. In other stories, there is mention of three ways along with the Samayik of the Punia Shravak.

The Story of Sulas

Chapter Two of the Yoga Shastra, Verse 30: A sadhu (holy person) pretended to be a sadhu and acted in an unrighteous manner. Seeing this, Shrenik, out of concern for the reputation of dharma (righteousness), stopped him and explained the error of his ways. The deva (god) then took the form of a pregnant sadhvi (holy woman) and claimed to be a sadhvi. Shrenik, out of devotion to dharma, brought her home and protected her. Seeing this, the deva thought, "Indra Maharaj praised him in the assembly, and I have found it to be true. Indeed, the words of such noble souls are not false." Then, the deva presented Shrenik with a necklace like a constellation of stars shining in the day, and two orbs. As the deva disappeared like a dream, he said, "Whoever joins this necklace when it breaks will die soon." The king gave the divine, beautiful necklace and the two orbs to his queen, Chelna. Jealous, Nandrani thought to herself, "Am I worthy of such a trivial gift?" In anger, she struck the two orbs against a pillar, causing them to break. From one orb emerged a pair of pure earrings like the moon, and from the other, a pair of radiant, divine garments. Seeing these divine objects, Nandrani was delighted and accepted the gifts. Great souls receive unimaginable benefits.

Afterwards, Shrenik returned to his palace and, offering an inducement, said to Kapila, "My dear, if you will feed the sadhus with devotion even once, I will make you rich and free you from servitude." Kapila replied, "My lord, even if you were to make me entirely of gold, or in anger, kill me, I would not do this unrighteous act." The disappointed king called Kalasaukarik and said, "Give up this business of killing living beings. If you do this for the sake of wealth, I will give you enough." He said, "I cannot give up this business of killing living beings, which has been passed down from my ancestors. Many people in my family depend on it. How can there be any fault in doing this violence, which sustains humanity?" The king had him thrown into a blind well. How could he commit violence without weapons in this blind well? He would be confined for a whole day and night. Thinking this, Shrenik went to the Lord and pleaded, "Lord, I have stopped Kalasaukarik from committing violence for a day and a night." The omniscient Lord said, "King, even in the blind well, he has killed five hundred buffaloes made of the filth of his body. Go and see for yourself." The king went and found it to be true. Shrenik was filled with remorse. "Damn my past karma. The Lord's words are not false."

The butcher, who always killed five hundred buffaloes, continued to increase his store of great sins. Before he attained hell, he developed terrible diseases in his body. Finally, at the time of his descent into hell, due to his great and terrible sins, he died in this world, suffering from a disease like that of a pig. At that time, he cried out loudly, "Woe is me! Oh, my father!" He found the pleasures of women, beds, flowers, the sound of the veena, sandalwood, and other agreeable comforts, as well as his eyes, skin, nose, ears, and tongue, to be extremely painful, like being pierced with thorns. Seeing his father's condition, Kalasaukarik's son, Sulas, went to the great and fearless Shri Abhayakamar, who was a liberated soul, and told him everything about his father. "The fruits of the terrible deeds of violence and other sins committed by your father are like this. It is true that the fruits of intense sinful actions are also intense. No one else can escape the consequences of these sinful actions. Nevertheless, for his sake, do something that will bring him peace. The way to do this is to make him consume things that are opposite to his senses. Water is not the right remedy for the stench of excrement."

Upon this, Sulas went home and fed his father bitter and pungent substances, gave him hot water like the juice of heated copper, smeared his body with excrement, made him sleep on a bed of thorns, made him listen to the harsh sounds of donkeys and camels, and showed him terrifying forms like those of demons, ghosts, and skeletons. By consuming these and other such unfavorable things, Kalasaukarik found relief. He said to Sulas, "Son, after a long time, I have eaten delicious food, drunk cold water, lain on a soft, ticklish bed, been smeared with fragrant substances, heard sweet sounds, and seen beautiful forms."

The Story of Sulas

Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 30: "What should I say? I have never experienced such joy as I have today. Why have you kept me deprived of these pleasures until now?" Hearing his father's words filled with wonder, Sulas thought to himself, "Oh! If he is experiencing the fruits of so many sins in this very life, what will his state be in the afterlife in hell, etc.?" As Sulas was thinking this, Kalasaukarik closed his eyes forever. He died and went to the seventh hell called Apratisthan. 

After performing the death rites of his father, his relatives said to Sulas, "Son! Now you sit in your father's place and take charge of his business (work), so that we may remain prosperous because of you." To this, Sulas replied, "I will never take up this work. I have seen my father suffer the bitter fruits of these cruel deeds in this very life, and he will suffer even more bitter fruits in future lives. Just as I cherish my own life, so too do other beings cherish their own lives. Therefore, to sustain one's own life by destroying the lives of others is a very bad deed. Shame on such animal-killers and other murderers. Seeing the bitter fruits of violence firsthand, who would be willing to engage in a violent livelihood? Who would knowingly go to the mouth of death by eating the fruit that directly invites death?"

Hearing this, his relatives began to insist, "Sulas! If you will incur sin from killing animals, will it only be you who will suffer? Just as family property is shared among all family members, so too will we share the fruits of sin. You just kill one buffalo first. After that, we will kill the other animals. This will cause you very little sin." To experience how much pain it causes to hurt another being, Sulas struck his thigh with a sharp axe, causing him to faint and fall immediately. When he regained consciousness, he cried out in a mournful voice, "Alas, father! I am still very restless from the pain of this harsh blow of the axe! Oh, brothers! Someone share my pain, so that it may lessen. Take my sorrow and save me from this pain! Alas, I am dying!"

Seeing Sulas groaning in pain, his brothers standing nearby said to him, "Brother! Can anyone take someone else's pain, or help someone in their sorrow?" To this, Sulas gave them a sharp rebuke, "Brothers! If you all together cannot take away even this little pain of mine, how will you share the pain of hell? By committing sinful deeds for the whole family, I alone will have to suffer the torment of hell in the afterlife, while you all, the family and clan, will remain here. Therefore, even though violence has been prevalent in my family from generation to generation, I will not engage in such violence. If someone's father is blind, should the son also become blind?"

At the very moment when Sulas was uttering these words filled with pain, Prince Abhayakumar arrived there to inquire about his well-being and take care of him. Embracing Sulas, he said, "Well done, Sulas! You have done a very good thing. I have listened carefully to all your words, that is why I have come to thank you with joy. Instead of getting caught in the mire of sin from family tradition, you have abandoned it from afar. Therefore, your life is truly blessed, you are truly commendable. We are partial to virtues." Thus, the righteous prince Abhayakumar, with sweet words, congratulated him and returned to his place.

On the other hand, Sulas, who was afraid of a bad fate, did not heed the words of his relatives at all, and gradually embraced the 12 vows of a Shravak. Just as Redra attained wealth, so too did Sulas attain the wealth of Dharma. It is true that whoever abandons the violence prevalent in their family tradition, like Sulas, the son of Kalasaukarik, heaven and wealth are not far away for him. In fact, he becomes worthy of meritorious deeds. ||30||

One who commits violence, no matter how much he practices restraint of the senses, etc., can neither earn new merit nor atone for his sins and purify himself. In this regard, it is said:

## Condemnation of the Person Who Preaches Violence and the So-Called Preaching

**Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verses 31 to 35**

**Verse 31:**

**Translation:**  "Control of the senses, worship of gods and gurus, charity, study of scriptures, and austerity - all these are useless and fruitless unless a person abandons violence."

**Explanation:**  "As long as violence, whether rooted in peace or prevalent in family traditions, is not abandoned, even good deeds like control of the senses, worship of gods and gurus, giving charity to deserving recipients, studying religious scriptures, and performing rigorous austerities like Chandrayana, do not yield any good results like gaining merit or reducing sins. They all become futile. Therefore, violence committed for the sake of happiness and peace of meat-loving families or for upholding rigid family customs is prohibited."

**Verse 32:**

**Translation:** "Alas! Cruel and greedy preachers of the scriptures of violence, they trap these innocent, gullible believers in their web of words and lead them to the harsh land of hell."

**Explanation:** "Compassionate individuals never preach violence or create scriptures filled with violence. But it is a great pity that cruel and greedy preachers of violent scriptures, blinded by their desire for meat like Manu, lead innocent and devout people (by misleading or confusing them) to the depths of hell. Why are these preachers called blind to their greed? The answer is that they lack the pure vision of innate wisdom or the eye of association with wise individuals. It is said, 'One eye is innate wisdom, the other is association with wise individuals. In this world, whoever lacks these two eyes is truly blind, even if they have physical eyes. If such a person is inclined towards the wrong path, who is to blame? Only themselves!' Intelligent individuals should not be fooled by the sweet words of these deceivers and should use their wisdom to discern right from wrong."

**Verse 33:**

**Translation:** "Brahma created animals for the purpose of sacrifice. The sacrifice itself is for the welfare of the entire universe. Therefore, the violence that occurs in the sacrifice is not violence. It does not lead to sin."

**Explanation:** "When asked why there is no fault in the violence that occurs in a sacrifice, the answer is given: The death of the creature being sacrificed is a great benefit, or the loss of a son, wife, or wealth is a great benefit. The violence in a sacrifice is beneficial for those who die because it is different from the violence that arises from misfortune, the violence that arises from wrongdoing, and the violence that leads to the fruits of hell. Those who die from this violence do not experience the fruits of hell. Therefore, this violence is not harmful but beneficial."

**Verse 34:**

**Translation:** "Medicinal herbs, animals like goats, trees like the sacrificial post, animals like oxen, horses, and cows, and birds like sparrows and crows - when they are destroyed for the sake of sacrifice, they are not destroyed (dead) but attain higher births like gods and Gandharvas, or they attain long life in places like Uttarakuru."

**Verse 35:**

**Translation:** "Manu said that animals should be sacrificed only in Madhuparka, a type of ritual, in the Jyotishtoma sacrifice, and in rituals for the ancestors and gods, and not elsewhere."

Animal sacrifice performed in a yajna is cruel and bears the fruit of sin.
It is ordained in the Yoga Shastra, Second Light, verses 36 to 38; Pitru Shraddha Karma, in which Shraddha is performed for parents and other ancestors; and Daivat Karma, in which Maha Yajna and other rituals are performed for the Devas; in all these rituals, animal sacrifice should be performed, not in other activities. That is, the animal sacrifice ordained in these activities is not a sin; animal sacrifice elsewhere is a sin. || 35 ||
Thus Manu has said in the fifth chapter of Manusmriti.
|| 92 || Eshvarthshu Pashun Hinsan Vedatattvarthavidh Dwijah. Atmanam Cha Pashunshchaiva Gamayatyanuttamam Gatim || 36 ||
Meaning: The learned Brahmin who sacrifices animals for the aforementioned activities, knowing the true meaning of the Vedas, takes himself and the animals to the highest state (heaven, liberation, etc.). || 36 ||
Leaving aside the matter of performing the sacrifice, how can those who preach violence to others be justified? This is explained. || 93 || Ye Chakruh Krurakarmaanah Shastram Hinsopadeshakam. Kva Te Yasyanthi Narake, Nastikhebhyo'pi Nastikaah || 37 ||
Those who have composed scriptures (Manusmriti, etc.) that preach violence (inspiration) without themselves performing violence, appear to be cruel and merciless, but they are even greater atheists than atheists. It is not known which hell they will go to? || 37 ||
Meaning
Further it is said:
|| 94 || Varam Varaakashcharvaako, Yo'sau Prakatanastikah. Vedoktitaapasachchhadmachchhannam Raksho Na Jaiminih || 38 ||
Meaning: The poor Charvaka, who is known in the world as an atheist without any hypocrisy, is good; but Jaimini, a demon hidden in the guise of a tapasvi, who deceives people in the name of the Vedas by saying, "This is what the Vedas say," is not good. || 38 ||
Explanation:
• The poor Lokayatika or Charvaka, being free from hypocrisy, can be considered somewhat better than Jaimini. But Jaimini, who, under the guise of a tapasvi, openly prescribes the killing of living beings by presenting Vedic verses and thus deceives the people, is not good. His statement that "Brahma created animals for the sake of yajna" is mere wordplay; the truth is that all living beings are born in different auspicious and inauspicious wombs according to their own karma. Therefore, it is wrong to present the theory of creation by saying that one is born to give birth to another. "Perform yajna (which involves animal sacrifice) for the peace and well-being of all beings in the world"; this statement is also a fallacy or biased. "Vedic or Yajnik violence is not violence"; this statement is also ridiculous. The statement that the animals, medicines, etc., killed or destroyed for the sake of yajna attain a higher state, should be understood by those who have blind faith in it. One cannot attain a higher state simply by being killed for the sake of yajna without performing good deeds. And suppose that one attains a higher state simply by being killed for the sake of yajna, then why not kill one's parents in the yajna and send them to a higher state, or why not die in the yajna oneself and go to heaven immediately? Therefore, the poor innocent animal, as it were, pleads with the Yajnik: "Sir! I have no desire to go to heaven. I am not asking you for heaven or anything else. I am always content with eating grass and straw. Therefore, it is not right to kill me by showing me the lure of heaven. If those who are killed in the yajna really go to heaven, then why don't you kill your parents or other relatives in the yajna and send them to heaven?" Violence like Madhuparka, etc., is beneficial, others are not; this is the statement of a free-willed person. How can there be any difference between violence and violence, that one violence is beneficial and the other is harmful? Is there any difference between poison and poison? Therefore, virtuous souls should abandon all kinds of violence. As it is said in the Dashavaikalika Sutra (Jain Agam): All living beings want to live, no one wants to die. Therefore, the Nigranthamas abandon heinous acts like killing living beings. The statement that "yajna performed with animal sacrifice bestows a higher state on oneself and the animal" is something that only a very bold person would make. It may be that the one who is dying

## Examples of Violent Scriptures

**Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verses 39-46**

**38.** A non-violent animal, if it has good intentions, can attain liberation through non-action and non-attachment. But how can a Brahmin who performs animal sacrifice or encourages it in a Yajna attain liberation?

**39.** In conclusion, it is said: "Those who kill beings out of cruelty, under the pretext of offering to the gods or performing Yajna, go to terrible hell."

**Explanation:** They kill beings for offering to deities like Bhairava, Chandi, etc., or for offerings on festivals like Mahanavami, Magha Ashtami, Chaitra Ashtami, Shravan Shukla Ekadashi, etc. They go to terrible hells like Naraka. Here, the reason for offering to deities is specifically mentioned. And in conclusion, it is said, "Under the pretext of Yajna." When there are faultless and independent means of Dharma practice, then holding on to faulty and dependent means of Dharma practice is never considered beneficial. Why go to the mountain for a sage when you can find one in the courtyard of your house?

**40.** It is a matter of great regret that those with dull intellect have abandoned Dharma, which is rooted in peace, good conduct, and compassion, and has the welfare of the world as its goal, and have declared violence as the cause of Dharma.

**Explanation:** Peace, which is victory over passions and senses, good conduct, which is beautiful nature, and compassion, which is kindness towards beings, these three are the roots of Dharma. Such Dharma is the cause of progress (worldly prosperity) and liberation (spiritual liberation or Moksha). This kind of Dharma is beneficial for the world. But it is regrettable that they abandon the means of such peaceful Dharma and declare violence as the means of Dharma, neglecting the real means of Dharma. The dullness of those who present this distorted view is evident.

**41-46.** Up to this point, we have condemned the violence motivated by greed, which is done for the sake of peace, the violence that is traditional, the violence that is done in Yajna, and the violence that is done for the sake of offerings to deities. Now, the discussion regarding violence related to ancestor worship remains. We present it in the following six verses, taking it verbatim from another scripture (the third chapter of Manusmriti).

**41.** I will explain in detail the offering of Havir (oblation) to the ancestors, which is prescribed for a long time and for eternity.

**42.** The ancestors of humans are pleased for one month by the offering of sesame seeds, rice, barley, black gram, water, roots, and fruits, given according to the prescribed rituals.

**43.** They are pleased for two months by the offering of fish meat, for three months by the offering of deer meat, for four months by the offering of antelope meat, and for five months by the offering of bird meat.

**44.** They are pleased for six months by the offering of goat meat, for seven months by the offering of sheep meat, for eight months by the offering of ox meat, and for nine months by the offering of buffalo meat.

**45.** They are pleased for ten months by the offering of boar and buffalo meat, for eleven months by the offering of rabbit and hare meat.

**46.** They are pleased for a year by the offering of cow meat, milk, and milk pudding, and for twelve years by the offering of the meat of a wild boar.

**(Manusmriti 3/266-271)**

**Explanation:** The ancestors are pleased by the offering of Havir (oblation), which is prescribed for a long time and for eternity, given to them according to the prescribed rituals. What is the ritual of ancestor worship? I will explain it completely.

The Glory of Ahimsa (Non-Violence)

From the verses 47 to 49 of the second chapter of the Yogashastra:

By offering the flesh of a fish, the ancestors are satisfied for two months, by the flesh of a deer for three months, by the flesh of a sheep for four months, by the flesh of birds for five months, by the flesh of the Parshva deer for seven months, by the flesh of the Raurava deer for nine months, by the flesh of a pig and a buffalo for ten months, and by the flesh of a hare and a tortoise for eleven months. By the oblation of the milk of a cow and the pudding made from milk, the ancestors are satisfied for twelve months (one year). If the weak, old and white-haired goat is sacrificed, then by its flesh the ancestors and forefathers are satisfied for twelve years.

In the aforementioned 46th verse, due to the predominance of the Shruti (scriptural injunction) over the Anumati (permission), the words 'gavyena payasa' and 'payasena' should be interpreted as meaning the milk of a cow and the pudding made from milk, respectively, and not as the flesh of a cow or the pudding made from the flesh of a cow. Some commentators interpret the word 'payasa' to mean the cooked milk and curd, etc. prepared with meat, or the rice cooked in milk, which is called 'dhudhapaka' or 'kheer'.

Explanation: After citing the scriptural statements that advocate violence for the sake of satisfying the ancestors, the text now explains the defects arising from such violence. 47. According to the Smriti (scriptures), the violence that is performed by the deluded for the sake of satisfying the ancestors, that too becomes the cause of their downfall.

48. He who gives fearlessness to all beings, for him there is no fear from any being. The fruit one obtains is in proportion to the nature of the gift one makes.

49. Alas! The violent deities who hold the bow, the staff, the discus, the sword, the spear, and the lance are also worshipped with the belief that they are deities!

## Examples of Violent Scriptures, the Fruit of Non-Violence

**Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verses 50-53**

| **Verse** | **English Translation** |
|---|---|
| 50 | They are worshipped with flowers, fruits, etc. (and also with liquor, meat, etc.) and that too with the understanding of divinity. The reason for the violence of the said gods. The weapons, etc., that reside with them are a sign - that is, bow, staff, discus, sword, trident, and spear, etc. weapons. They reveal their violent nature. Even if they are not violent, the symbols like bow, etc., are speaking signs of violence. If they do not commit violence, then what is the need to keep weapons? Their possession of weapons is inappropriate. But it is famous in the world that Rudra is the bow-bearer, Yama is the staff-bearer, Vishnu is the holder of the discus and sword, Shiva is the trident-bearer, and Kartikeya is the spear-bearer. From the indication, one should also understand about other gods who are weapon-bearers. |
| 51 | Thus, having prohibited violence in detail, now in two verses, the glory of non-violence is described. Non-violence is like a mother, beneficial to all beings. Non-violence is the river that flows nectar in this world, which is like a desert. Non-violence is the cloud of the rainy season that quenches the fire of suffering, and for beings suffering from the disease of the cycle of birth and death, non-violence is the ultimate medicine. |
| 52 | Now the fruit of practicing non-violence is described. Long life, excellent form, health, praiseworthiness; all these are the good fruits of non-violence. What else to say? Non-violence, like the wish-fulfilling cow, gives all desired fruits. |
| 53 | Not understanding, stammering, stuttering, muteness, disease in the mouth, etc., are all the fruits of falsehood. Knowing this, one should abandon falsehood in matters like marriage, etc. |

**Explanation:**

* **Verse 50:** This verse discusses the contradiction between the violent imagery associated with deities and the Jain principle of non-violence (ahimsa). It argues that even if these deities do not actively engage in violence, their possession of weapons is a symbol of violence and therefore inappropriate.
* **Verse 51:** This verse highlights the benefits of non-violence, comparing it to a mother, a life-giving river, a rain-bearing cloud, and a cure for suffering.
* **Verse 52:** This verse emphasizes the positive consequences of practicing non-violence, including long life, good health, and fulfillment of desires.
* **Verse 53:** This verse warns against the negative consequences of falsehood, including speech impediments and diseases. It encourages the abandonment of falsehood, especially in matters like marriage.

**Jain Terms:**

* **Ahimsa:** Non-violence
* **Jina:** A liberated soul, a Tirthankara
* **Karma:** The law of action and reaction
* **Moksha:** Liberation from the cycle of birth and death
* **Tirthankara:** A spiritual teacher who establishes a new Jain tradition

**Note:** The translation attempts to preserve the Jain terms while conveying the meaning accurately.

## Five Types of Gross Untruth

**Verse 54:** Speaking, becoming mute, developing a disease in the mouth, or the growth of a second tongue, are all the results of speaking untruth. Seeing this, and knowing the nature of untruth through scriptural knowledge, a Shravak should renounce gross untruth. It is also said: One who speaks untruthful words becomes mute, dull-witted, disabled, stammering, or has a voice that is unpleasant to hear. Such a person has a foul smell emanating from their mouth. ||53||

**Verse 54:** This explains the nature of gross untruth in relation to daughters, cows, and land. ||110||

**Verse 54:** Untruth related to daughters, cows, land, deposited or pledged items, and false witness, these five are called gross untruths. ||54||

**Explanation:**

1. **Untruth related to daughters:** Speaking untruth about a daughter in terms of substance, place, time, and feeling. For example, calling a good daughter bad, or a bad daughter good, or stating that a daughter from one country or province is from another, or stating that a young daughter is older, or an older daughter is younger. Similarly, stating that a daughter with certain qualities and abilities is flawed or incapable, or stating that a daughter with certain flaws or incapabilities is virtuous and capable. The word "daughter" should be understood to include all bipedal humans, such as boys, young men, and elders, through implication.

2. **Untruth related to cows:** Speaking untruth about a cow in terms of substance, place, time, and feeling. For example, stating that a thin, weak, and sickly cow is healthy, strong, and well-built, or stating that a Marwari cow is a Gujarati cow, or that a Gujarati cow is from Marwar. Stating that an older, aged, or repeatedly bred cow is young, youthful, and has been bred only once or twice, or stating the opposite. Stating that a cow that gives little milk gives a lot of milk, or stating the opposite. Stating that a virtuous or docile cow is flawed or prone to death, or stating that a flawed or prone-to-death cow is docile and virtuous. The word "cow" should be understood to include all four-legged animals, through implication.

3. **Untruth related to land:** Untruth related to land should also be understood as four types, in terms of substance, place, time, and feeling. For example, calling one's own land someone else's, or calling someone else's land one's own. Calling fertile land barren, or barren land fertile. Stating that land from one place is from another place. Stating that land that has been cultivated for a long time or is authorized is cultivated for a short time or unauthorized. Calling good land bad, or bad land good. Hiding the feeling of taking or not taking something related to land. The word "land" should be understood to include all things that grow on land, or money, wealth, property, houses, etc., through implication.

Someone might question why, instead of stating that untruth related to all bipedal or quadrupedal beings, or all inanimate objects, is gross untruth, only untruth spoken in relation to daughters, cows, or land is mentioned. The answer is that in common practice, there are very sacred ideas about daughters, cows, and land. In Indian culture, a daughter (virgin) is considered sacred because she is considered to be unchanging. Cows and the earth are considered "mothers." Therefore, speaking untruth about these three, which are accepted by the people, is considered highly reprehensible. Therefore, bipedal beings;

## Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verses 55-57

**Verses 55-57**

**Verse 55**

**Meaning:** One should not speak falsehood (gross untruth) that is against all beings, that is treacherous, and that is against virtue, i.e., that supports sin.

**Explanation:** Falsehood related to a daughter, a cow, and land is against the whole world and is known to be extremely reprehensible in social conduct. Therefore, one should not speak such falsehood. Falsehood spoken for the sake of a deposit is treacherous, so one should abandon it. And one should not give false testimony by believing in a dharma that is against virtue, i.e., a dharma that is sinful and against righteousness.

**Verse 56**

**Meaning:** By speaking falsehood, a person gains insignificance (disrepute) in this world. By falsehood, this person is called a liar, and such slander or ill-repute occurs in the world. By speaking falsehood, a person attains a low state. Therefore, one should abandon falsehood.

**Explanation:** Although speaking falsehood with a bad intention (contaminated intention) is prohibited, what is the harm if one speaks falsehood by mistake? In response to this, it is said:

**Verse 57**

**Meaning:** A wise person should not speak falsehood even by mistake (due to ignorance, delusion, blind faith, or carelessness). Just as strong winds break and destroy large trees, so too does falsehood destroy great virtues.

## Four Types of Untruth and Their Consequences

**Explanation of verses 57 to 80 from the Second Light of Yoga Shastra:**

One should not speak untruth even due to ignorance, doubt, delusion, jest, carelessness, or any other kind of negligence, let alone due to a distorted intention (wrong motive). Speaking untruth due to negligence uproots virtuous actions in the same way a violent storm uproots large trees.

The great sages have said in the Agamas: A seeker who does not know the truth of past events, present facts, and future occurrences should not speak with certainty, saying "This is it."  Similarly, one should not speak with certainty about things that are doubtful in the past, present, or future, saying "It is like this." Instead, one should speak with certainty only about things that are certain in the past, present, or future, saying "It is like this." (Dasha Va. 9/8, 9, 10)

There are four types of untruth:

1. **Bhutanihnava:** Concealing or misrepresenting something that exists. For example, saying "There is no soul," "There is no such thing as merit and demerit, or the afterlife."
2. **Abhutasadbhavana:** Claiming something that does not exist or is not of a certain kind. For example, saying "Every soul is omniscient," or "Every soul is omnipresent," or "The soul is the size of a black gram."
3. **Arthatar:** Representing one thing as another. For example, calling a cow a bull, or a bull a horse.
4. **Garha:** Speaking something out of caution, unpleasantness, or anger. There are three types of Garha:

    * **Savdha (sinful) emotion:** Speaking out of a sinful motive. For example, "Kill him," "Give him a taste of his own medicine."
    * **Aapriya (unpleasant) emotion:** Speaking out of an unpleasant motive. For example, "He is blind," "He is lame," "He is a thief," "He is dead."
    * **Aakrosh (anger):** Speaking out of anger. For example, "He is the son of a prostitute," "You scoundrel," "You rogue," "You cheat," "You lowlife," "You bastard!"

Untruthful speech is completely unacceptable. Now, we will discuss the consequences of untruth in this world.

**Verse 58:** Untruthful speech leads to enmity, sorrow, regret, distrust, disrespect, and disgrace in the kingdom, etc. Just as improper diet leads to various diseases, so too does untruthful speech lead to many evils in the world.

Now, we will discuss the consequences of untruth in the afterlife.

**Verse 59:** Due to the influence of untruthful speech, a being is born in the next life in the bodies of endless-bodied Nigoda beings, in the bodies of animals, or in hell.

Now, we will give the example of Kalikaacharya, who renounced untruthful speech, and Vasuraja, who spoke untruth, to inspire renunciation of untruth.

**Verse 60:** Kalikaacharya never spoke untruth, even out of fear of death or coercion, or out of respect for someone's request. But whoever speaks untruth due to these reasons goes to hell like Vasuraja.

Here are the two examples:

**Kalikaacharya, the steadfast one:**

In ancient times, there was a city called Turamani, the crown jewel of the earth, ruled by King Jitashatru. In this city lived a Brahmin woman named Rudra. She had a son named Datta, who was very dissolute, a gambler, and a drunkard. He found pleasure in indulging in these vices. He lived a life of unrestrained freedom.

The Tale of Kalikaacharya

Chapter Two of the Yoga Shastra, Verse 60: With the intention of acting freely according to his own desires, he began to serve the king. The king, too, made him the head of his close associates, who were like shadows to him. Just as a poisonous vine, when given even a little support from a tree, continues to grow and spread, so too did Datta. By some means or other, through cunning tactics, he incited the people and caused the king to be exiled. And, "Both the sinner and the pigeon uproot their shelter." Having thus exiled the king, the sinner Datta himself ascended the throne. A lowly person, given even a little support at the foot, gradually climbs to the head. Now Datta, devoid of Dharma-buddhi, began to perform a great sacrifice involving animal slaughter, as if polluting the entire world with the smoke of sin.

Once, Sri Kalikaacharya, the embodiment of restraint and Datta's maternal uncle, arrived in that city while wandering. Datta, blinded by falsehood, had absolutely no desire to go to the Acharya, but under immense pressure from his mother, he reluctantly went to his maternal uncle (Acharya), who was a householder. As soon as he arrived, he spoke arrogantly to the Acharya, like a madman intoxicated with alcohol, "Acharya! If you are a knower, then tell me the fruit of this sacrifice." Hearing this, Sri Kalikaacharya said, "My dear! If you are asking about Dharma, then listen. Not to do to others what is unpleasant to oneself, this is the greatest Dharma." Datta repeated his question, "Sir! I am asking about the fruit of the sacrifice. You are talking about Dharma." To this, the Acharya said, "A sacrifice based on violence is not beneficial for life, but rather it binds one to sinful actions." This should have satisfied him, but with the intention of provoking the Acharya, Datta, with his wicked mind, asked the same question again, "These talks of violence and non-violence are like ways to deceive simple people. Give me a straight answer, what is the fruit of this sacrifice?" The Acharya replied calmly, "The fruit of such a sacrifice is hell." Enraged, Datta said, "How can I believe that the fruit of this sacrifice will be hell?" Then the Acharya, who had the power of foresight, replied with the same love, "My child! You will believe it when, seven days from now, you are cooked in the dog-pot of the Chandala." At this, Datta jumped up in anger, his eyes red, his eyebrows furrowed, and he spoke like a possessed man, "What proof is there of this?" Kalikaacharya replied gently, "The proof is that before you are cooked in the Chandala's pot, you will suddenly have excrement in your mouth." In a fit of rage, Datta arrogantly asked, "Then tell me! How and when will you die?" The Acharya said, "I will not be killed by anyone. I will die naturally in my time; and after death, I will go to heaven." Datta, in a fury, ordered his servants, "Arrest this foolish, wicked Acharya and throw him in prison. Let him rot there!" Upon receiving the order, the servants seized Kalikaacharya and threw him in prison.

Meanwhile, the vassals, angered and distressed by the sinner Datta, decided to call back the former king and hand over the kingdom to him. Datta, filled with fear, like an elephant hiding in the bushes from the roar of a lion, remained hidden in his house. By a stroke of fate, Datta, by mistake, took the eighth day for the seventh day and, out of fear, ordered the Kotwal and others to arrange for guards and watch on the highway, making arrangements for his safety. On the seventh day, the wicked Datta, thinking wickedly, mounted his horse and went out, thinking, "Today I will kill that wicked muni like an animal and enjoy it." On the other hand, before Datta, a gardener was entering the city in the morning, carrying a basket of flowers, when he felt a strong urge to defecate. He did not think it proper to hold it back, so he sat down to defecate in a small alcove by the side of the road, and fearing that a soldier might catch him, he covered it with some flowers and went on. A little later, Datta's horse was running fast when, suddenly, the horse's hoof kicked up the gardener's excrement and it landed in Datta's mouth. Truly, the words of a great ascetic are not false. Like a stone struck, Datta, too, was disheartened and weakened by this unexpected event, and without saying anything to the vassals, he returned to his place. Seeing Datta return, the people thought, "He knows nothing of our secret council. Therefore, according to our pre-determined plan, we will..."

The Story of Vasuraja
Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 60

Before entering the house, they surrounded him like bulls and bound him. Just as the sun appears with its brilliance after the night has passed, so too did the former king appear at that time. The people had reinstated him on the throne. Seeing the wicked Datta fleeing like a serpent from the casket, the former king's anger flared up. He seized Datta and threw him into the furnace of the Chandala, like a hellish pit, and set fire to it from below. As the furnace heated up, the dogs of the hunter pounced on the screaming Datta, tearing him apart, just as the Asuras in hell tear apart the righteous.

Meanwhile, the former king freed the truthful Kalkaacharya from prison. Just as Kalkaacharya did not lie out of fear of the king, or at anyone's request or persuasion, but remained steadfast in his vow of truthfulness, so too should wise men never lie and protect their vow of truthfulness.

The downfall of Vasuraja due to speaking untruth: ... In the Chedi country, on the banks of the Shuktimati river, the city of Shuktimati was situated, like his playmate. There, like a magnificent ruby, the king Abhichandra ruled, the crown of the earth. Just as the truthful Yudhishthira was born in the house of Panduraja, so too was the truthful Vasu born in the house of King Abhichandra. As soon as he reached adolescence, Vasurajakumar was sent to study under the guru Kshirakadambak. At that time, his son Parvat, the prince Vasu, and the student Narada, all three studied together under Kshirakadambak Upadhyaya. Once, all three students, tired from their studies, fell asleep on the roof of the house. At that time, the Jhangachari Munis, flying through the sky, saw them and said to each other, "One of these three will go to heaven and two will go to hell." Kshirakadambak Upadhyaya heard this conversation and was deeply troubled. He was saddened, "I am their teacher, and my students will go to hell! What a fate! But I must find out who will go to heaven and who will go to hell." Therefore, with his intelligence and skill, he made three roosters out of dough filled with lac. One day, he called all three students to him and gave each of them a rooster, saying, "Take this and kill it in a place where no one can see."

Vasu and Parvat, each taking their rooster, went to a secluded place outside the city, in a direction where there was no human traffic. Therefore, thinking that no one would see them, they killed their roosters. Mahatma Narada, taking his rooster, reached a secluded, uninhabited region, but looking around, he thought, "My guru has commanded that I kill it where no one can see. But this rooster is seeing me, I am seeing it, the birds in the sky are seeing it, the Lokapalas are seeing it, and even if no one else is seeing it, the wise men are surely seeing it. Nothing done secretly, even in the darkest of places, can be hidden from them. Therefore, I cannot kill this rooster anywhere. Then how will I obey my guru's command?" Thus, diving into the ocean of contemplation, Narada suddenly had a flash of insight. "Perhaps, the ever-merciful guru, who is always inclined towards non-violence, has given us this rooster to test us. If he wanted to kill it, he could have done it himself. He has given us three roosters to kill, his intention is to test our non-violent nature. His command means, 'Do not kill the rooster.' I will not kill it." Thus, deciding not to kill the rooster, Narada brought it back to his guru without killing it. He explained to his guru the reason why he could not kill the rooster. The guru decided in his heart that this one would surely go to heaven and embraced Narada affectionately, exclaiming, "Good, good, very good, son!"

Soon after, Vasu and Parvat also arrived. They said, "Here, guru! We have obeyed your command. We took our roosters to a place where no one could see and killed them." The guru said in a tone of reproach,

The Story of Vasuraja
Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 6 | 'Sinful souls! You did not consider my command properly. When you killed the rooster, did you not see him at that time? Or was he not seeing you? Did the celestial birds and other flying creatures not see?' Well, you are unfit. Kshirakadambak decided that both of them seemed to be destined for hell. And becoming indifferent towards them, his interest in teaching them ended. He started thinking - the true guru's teachings for Vasu and Parvat, the disciple, bear fruit according to the recipient. The water of the clouds, due to the difference in location, falls into the mouth of the oyster and becomes a pearl, and the same water falls into the mouth of the snake and becomes poison, or falls on barren land or salty land or in the sea and becomes salty. Alas, my dear son and my son, more dear than my son, Vasu, both will go to hell.
What is the benefit of staying here? Thinking this way, Kshirakadambak Upadhyay became detached from the world. He took initiation from his guru with intense dispassion. Now his place was taken by his son Parvat, who was wise in interpretation. Blessed by the guru, he became proficient in all scriptures, and with a pure mind like the clouds of autumn, he went to his birthplace. King Abhichandra, who was like the moon among kings, also took monastic initiation at the right time. Vasuraja, who was like Vasudeva, ascended the throne. Vasuraja became famous in this world as a truth-speaker. Vasuraja spoke only the truth to protect his fame. One day, a hunter went to the Vindhya mountain to hunt. He aimed an arrow at a deer; but unfortunately, the arrow stopped in mid-air and fell. To find out the reason for the arrow falling in mid-air, he reached the spot. As soon as he touched it with his hand, he realized that there was a crystal rock as clear as the sky. 'So, I saw the deer reflected on the other side of this rock, like the shadow of the earth in the moon.' This rock cannot be known without touching it with the hand. Therefore, this rock is definitely worthy of Vasuraja. Thinking this, the hunter silently picked up the rock and went to Vasuraja, presented it to him and told him the whole story of how he got the rock. King Vasu was very pleased to hear this and looked at the rock for a moment. He gave the hunter a lot of reward and sent him away. The king secretly built a platform for the rock in the royal court, suitable for sitting, and killed the craftsman who built the platform. 'It is true that kings never belong to anyone.' The king had a throne installed on the platform. People who were unaware of this secret began to understand that Vasuraja's throne was suspended in the air due to the influence of truth. Delighted by the truth, the gods also stayed in the service of this king. Thus, the bright fame of Vasuraja spread in every direction. Frightened by that fame, other kings became subservient to Vasunrip. 'Fame, whether true or false, always brings victory to kings.' One day, Narada came to visit Parvat's ashram. Then he saw the intelligent Parvat teaching his disciples the interpretation of the Rig Veda. At that time, the sutra 'Ajairayastavyam' came, and while explaining it, he said the meaning of the word 'Aj' as 'goat'. Hearing this, Narada said to Parvat, 'Brother! You are making a mistake somewhere in saying this meaning. You have mistakenly taken the meaning of 'Aj' as a goat. Which does not happen. The real meaning of 'Aj' is - 'three-year-old grain, which cannot sprout.' Our gurudev also took the meaning of 'Aj' as grain. Have you forgotten him?' At that time, Parvat protested and said, 'The meaning you are telling is not what my father said. He took the meaning of the word 'Aj' as a goat. And the same meaning is found in the dictionary.' Then Narada said, 'Brother! Every word has two meanings, secondary and primary. Guruji told us the secondary meaning of the word 'Aj'. Guruji was a preacher of Dharma. Shruti is also the embodiment of Dharma. Therefore, friend! Why are you earning sin by speaking contrary to both the meaning of Shruti and the teachings of the guru? Parvatak now made it a matter of his prestige and said stubbornly, 'Guruji has explained the meaning of 'Aj' as a goat in the Shruti verse 'Ajanmeshan'. Do you earn Dharma by contradicting the meaning told by Guruji?' Arrogant false speech does not punish or frighten a person. Therefore,

The Story of Vasuraja

The Second Light of Yoga Shastra, Verse 60: Parvatak said, "Let us make a wager on this matter. Whoever fails to prove their side as true shall have their tongue cut off. First, agree to this wager. Then, we will both go to our classmate Vasuraja, considering him to be authentic, to seek his judgment on this matter. The decision of that truthful one shall be binding on both of us." Narada agreed to the wager and to accept the decision given by Vasuraja in this regard, because "Truth does not fear!" One who speaks the truth does not fear or feel troubled. When Parvat's mother heard about their dispute and the wager they had made, she became very worried and took her son Parvatak aside and said, "Son! When I was doing the household chores, I heard your father say that the meaning of the word 'Aj' is three-year-old grain. The wager you have made to cut off your tongue is filled with ego and stubbornness. You have done this very inappropriately. One who acts without thinking gets entangled in many troubles." Parvat said, slightly hesitant, "Mother! I have already done what I did in a fit of passion. Now, tell me, is there any way that the decision can be in our favor?"

Distressed by the fear of the terrible calamity that awaited Parvat in the future and with a heart pierced like thorns, his mother went straight to Vasuraja. What is not done for a son? Seeing the Brahmin woman, Vasuraja greeted her with a bow and said, "Mother! Come, please come in! Seeing you is like seeing Guru Shri Kshirakadambak himself today. Tell me, what can I do for you? What can I give you?" Then the Brahmin woman said, "Earth-King! I need a son's blessing, only this one thing is needed, son! What is the use of wealth and grain, etc., when a son is gone?" Vasu said, "Mother! Parvat is revered by me; I must protect him. The scriptures say, 'One should treat the son of a Guru like a Guru himself.' In times of calamity, who has Yama, the god of death, issued a summons for today? Mother! Tell me, who wants to kill my brother? Why do you worry while I am alive?" Then Parvat's mother said, "There has been a dispute between Parvat and Narada over the meaning of the word 'Aj'. My son Parvat has made this wager: if the meaning of 'Aj' is not a goat, then I will cut off my tongue, and if it is a goat, then you will cut off your tongue. Both of them have considered you as the judge, the authentic person, in this dispute. Therefore, I have come to you to request that you make the meaning of the word 'Aj' as a goat to protect your brother. Great men are those who do good even at the cost of their lives, then how can you not do this small act of kindness with your words?"

Hearing this, Vasunrip said, "Mother! This would be to speak untruth. How can I speak untruth? Even when faced with the possibility of death, truthful people do not speak untruth. Others may say anything, but a person who fears sin should never speak untruth, and then how can I speak against the words of my Guru or give false testimony?" Parvat's mother said in anger, "Then there are two paths before you: if you want to be a benefactor, then protect the Guru's son and ensure his well-being, and if you want to be selfish, then insist on truthfulness." After saying this with great emphasis, Vasuraja agreed to her request. Kshirakadambak's wife went home happily.

At the appointed time, the learned Narada and Parvat both came to Vasuraja's royal court for the judgment. In the court, people of good character, who could discern the truth and falsehood like milk and water, gathered. Vasuraja, the president, was seated on a throne placed on a platform made of pure crystal stone, looking as beautiful as the sun between the earth and the sky. After that, Narada and Parvat presented their interpretations of the word 'Aj' before Vasuraja and said, "King! You are the judge between us, tell us the true meaning of this word. Because the Brahmins and the elders have said, 'Just as the sun is between heaven and earth, so are you the mediator between us; you are the judge in our dispute. Now you are the proof. Whatever your decision will be, it will be binding on both of us. The hot divine pot or the iron ball that is lifted in the hand for truth or oath actually remains stable because of truth. The earth is based on truth, even the dust is established on truth."

## Vasuraja's Descent into Hell, Kaushik's Descent into Hell

The second light of the Yoga Shastra, verse 61 states: Truth sets the wind in motion. Truth subdues the gods. Truth brings rain. All conduct is based on truth. If you base others on truth, what can be said about you? Give a decision that is appropriate for the truthful. Vasuraja, as if not hearing or ignoring the above words about truth, without considering anything with long-sightedness, said, "The Guruji had made the meaning of 'Aj' as 'goat' in 'Aj-Meshan' (meaning 'goat-ram')." Speaking such a false word, the deity presiding over the altar became enraged. He shattered both the crystal-clear altar like the sky and the throne placed on it. Vasuraja was immediately thrown to the ground, as if they had undertaken to throw him into hell. Narada also immediately left from there, scorning him by saying, "Who would look at your face, you who give false witness like a Chandala?" Vasuraja, humiliated by the gods for speaking false words, went to the terrible hell.  Whenever any son of the guilty Vasuraja sat on the throne, the gods would kill him. In this way, the gods killed eight sons of Vasu. Therefore, hearing the fruit of Vasuraja's speaking falsely in this way, those who listen to the Jain teachings, the glorious souls, should not speak falsely even if they are under pressure, coercion, or consideration, or even if they fear the loss of their lives. This is the heart of the Narada-Parvat-Katha!

That truthful word, which benefits the virtuous, even if it is true by origin, is considered to be in the category of falsehood if it causes pain to others. Therefore, one should not speak even such truth, which causes pain to the hearts of others.

**Verse 117:**

*Do not speak even truth, which causes pain to others. For it is heard in the world that Kaushik went to hell for speaking such words.*

**Explanation:**

Many times, a person's word appears to be true in worldly conduct; but when considered from the ultimate point of view, it is found to be harmful to others, then it should be considered as falsehood. One should not speak such words that cause harm to the heart. Speaking such words leads to hell. It is heard from the world's traditions and other scriptures that Kaushik went to hell for speaking hurtful words (which are actually a form of falsehood) that cause pain to others. The story of Kaushik is as follows in the tradition of the sect:

**Kaushik's attainment of hell due to false words in the form of killing living beings:**

Kaushik, a wealthy ascetic, left his village and lived as a poor man on the banks of the Ganges River. There he ate roots and fruits. He became famous among the people as a non-possessive, selfless, and truthful person. Once, the ascetic saw thieves coming from a nearby village to loot. Just as a serpent enters its hole, those thieves entered the bushes near the hermitage. According to the footprints of the thieves, the villagers came to the ascetic's hermitage and asked him, "Great soul! You are truthful, tell us where those thieves went?" Kaushik, the ascetic, who was ignorant of the secrets of Dharma, said, "Those thieves have entered these dense bushes." Hearing this, just as hunters pounce on deer, they pounced on the thieves and killed them. Therefore, Kaushik, the ascetic, completed his lifespan and went to hell for speaking falsehood in the form of factual words that caused pain to others.

After forbidding even a little falsehood because it is harmful, now we express regret for those who speak great falsehood.

**Verse 118:**

*Even a little lie can lead to Raurava and other hells. What will be the fate of those who speak against the words of Shri Jinendradev?*

**Explanation:**

In this world, even a little lie, which is beneficial for a little gain, can cause a person to be born in Raurava, Maharaurava, and other hells. Oh! What will be the fate of those who speak against the words of Shri Jinendradev?

## The Flaw of False Speech and the Glory of Truthful Speech

This passage originates from the second chapter of the Yoga Shastra, verses 62 to 64. The word "Raurava" is commonly used to refer to hell. Otherwise, it is said - in all the hells. What will be the fate of those who contradict the teachings of Shri Jineshwardev and are false speakers, heretics, and those who follow their own opinions? They will attain a fate even worse than hell! Who can stop them from attaining this terrible fate? Therefore, it is said - "Oh! Truly, they are worthy of sorrow and regret." Even a slight deviation from the path of Jina's teachings, or a different interpretation, is a terrible sin, worse than all other sins. Due to the sin of even a slight deviation from the path of Rishabhdev, as established in the Marichi kalpa, even though he was praised by the gods in the Mahavira kalpa and was a Tirthankara, the Supreme Being, in all three realms, Prabhu (Mahavira) suffered countless torments inflicted by cowherds and others. And many great sinners, like those who kill women, cows, Brahmins, and unborn beings, have attained liberation in the same life. This is well-known. ||62||

Having explained the consequences of false speech, now the praise of truthful speech is given. ||119||

"Those who speak only truth, the root of knowledge and conduct, their feet dust purifies the earth." ||63||

**Meaning:** Truth is the root cause of knowledge and conduct. The commentators of the Bhagavad Vachana, following their own words, have said - "Naanakiryahim Mokkho" (Knowledge and conduct lead to liberation). The word "knowledge" also includes "darshan" (right perception). Because without darshan, knowledge is considered ignorance. A being with a false perception (mithyadrishti) perceives the true and false substances in a reversed manner. Their knowledge is based on their own opinions, leading to worldly wandering, and being a mere speaker of words without any real meaning, it does not bear the fruit of right knowledge. It is also said - "Because a being with a false perception does not differentiate between truth and falsehood, it is the cause of worldly wandering. Due to their own intellectual imagination, they create their own meanings, and thus, they are not bound by the scriptures or relative to the scriptures. Therefore, their (false) knowledge does not lead to detachment. This is why the knowledge of a being with a false perception is considered ignorance." ||63||

The influence of truthful speakers is also described in this world. ||1.20||

"Those who are wealthy in the great treasure of truth, do not speak falsehood. Neither ghosts, nor spirits, nor snakes, nor any other beings can harm them." ||64||

**Meaning:** Ghosts, spirits, and other beings harass their relatives. Snakes and lions are understood by implication. But those souls who are wealthy in the great treasure of truth, and do not speak falsehood, cannot be harassed by ghosts and others. In this regard, another verse (with meaning) says - "Truth is the second vow, like the embankment of a reservoir, protecting the water of non-violence. If the vow of truth is broken, the reservoir of non-violence will be unprotected and destroyed. Therefore, virtuous men should speak only truth, which is beneficial to all beings, or else they should remain silent, which is beneficial to all. One should not speak words that cause enmity, reveal someone's secret, create intense doubt, or are doubtful, violent, or gossipy. But if there is a destruction of dharma, a loss of action, or a loss of the true meaning of the principles of truth, then a powerful person should speak without being asked, to rectify it. Charvaka, Nastika, Kaulika, Vipra, Bauddha, Pancharatra, etc., have filled the world with falsehood and ridiculed it. Truly, the words that come out of their mouths are like the flow of a city drain, like foul-smelling water mixed with mud. A tree burnt by fire can become green again, but a person burnt by the fire of harsh words does not become green again in this world, by attaining the true path of dharma. Sandalwood, moonlight, Chandrakant gem, and a pearl necklace do not give as much joy as the true speech of humans."

## Description of Adattadan (Theft) and its Consequences

**Chapter 2, Light 2, Verses 65-69 of Yoga Shastra**

Even a Jati-dhari (one who wears matted hair), a naked or clothed ascetic, if he speaks falsely, becomes extremely blameworthy. If you place the sin arising from false speech on one side of a scale and all other sins on the other side and weigh them, the side of falsehood will be heavier. There are remedies to free those who commit sinful acts like adultery, theft, etc., but there is no remedy to free those who speak falsely. This is the fruit of being truthful: even the gods take his side, kings obey his commands, and even calamities like fire are pacified. ||64||

Thus, the description of the second vow of the householder Shramanopasaka is complete.

Now, the third vow is called Asteya Vrat (vow of non-stealing). Without explaining the bad consequences of Adattadan (theft), a person will not refrain from stealing. Therefore, first, we explain its consequences and then prohibit stealing. ||121||

**Durbhagyam preshyatam dasyam angachhedam daridratam | Adattatphalam jnatwa, sthula steyam vivarjayet ||65||**

Meaning: Bad luck (loss of fortune), servitude (working as a servant in another's house), slavery, physical dependence (cutting off limbs like hands, feet, etc.), poverty, etc., are the fruits of taking something that was not given (Adattadan - theft) in a previous life. ||65||

Knowing this from the scriptures or from the holy mouth of the Guru Maharaj, the seeker of happiness should abandon this gross Adattadan, which is called stealing in worldly affairs.

Further, we are explaining its nature in detail. ||122||

**Patitam vismrtam nashttam, sthitam sthapitam ahitam | Adattam na dadiit swam, parakiyam kvacit sudhih ||66||**

Meaning: Taking something that has fallen while walking or riding, something that has been left behind due to the owner's forgetfulness, something that has been lost, something that has been kept in such a way that the owner does not even know about it, or something that has been entrusted or deposited for safekeeping, or something that has been buried in the ground, without the owner's consent or permission, is theft. A wise person should not steal any kind of property, whether it is in danger, in terms of location, time, or emotion. ||66||

We are explaining how blameworthy the sin of theft is. ||123||

**Ayam lokah parloko, dharmo dhairya dhrti matih | Musnata parakiyam swam, mushitam sarvam apyadaha ||67||**

Meaning: One who steals another's wealth does not only steal his wealth, but also steals his birth in this world, his rebirth, his lack of Dharma, his patience, his wisdom, and his understanding of what is right and wrong. ||67||

We are explaining that there is more blame in theft than in violence. ||124||

**Ekasyaikam kshanam duhkham, maryamanasya jayate | Saputrapautra sya punar yavaj jivam hrite dhane ||68||**

Meaning: The being who is killed does not suffer for a long time, but only for a moment. But when someone's wealth is stolen, his son, grandson, and the whole family suffer for a lifetime. That is, the wound of his suffering does not heal for his entire life. ||68||

Now, we are explaining the consequences of theft in detail. ||125||

**Chaurya papadrumasy eha, vadha bandhadhikam phalam | Jayate paraloke tu, phalam naraka vedana ||69||**

Meaning: The fruit of the sin-tree of theft is death, imprisonment, etc., in this life, but in the next life, it bears the terrible fruit of hellish torment. ||69||

Explanation: Perhaps due to good fortune (good luck) or the carelessness of the king, police, etc., one may not be caught, but the constant fear of being caught, anxiety, ill health, bad reputation (disgrace), etc., are the fruits of this life. ||69||

## The Story of the Thief, Mooladeva and Mandlika

**The Yoga Shastra, Second Light, verses 70 to 72, explain this.**

**Verse 70:**

**Meaning:** Just as a man cannot experience peace when a sharp thorn or arrow pierces him, so too, a thief cannot find peace day or night, whether awake or asleep. The thief is not only deprived of peace, but his family and friends also abandon him.

**Verse 71:**

**Meaning:** Just as no one associates with a Mlechchha (outcaste) even for a moment, so too, a thief's friends, children, wife, brothers, parents, etc., do not associate with him even for a moment.

**Explanation:**

The scriptures of ethics state that associating with those who commit the five great sins - Brahmahatya (killing a Brahmin), drinking alcohol, stealing, sexual intercourse with a Guru's wife, and betrayal - is also considered a great sin. A thief, one who instigates theft, one who advises theft, one who knows the secrets of the theft, one who buys stolen goods, one who facilitates the purchase of stolen goods, one who provides shelter to the thief, and one who feeds the thief - all eight are considered criminals in the eyes of the law.

**Verse 72:**

**Meaning:** Even if a thief is a relative, the king will capture him like the Mandlika thief. But if a thief abandons theft, he will become eligible for heavenly bliss like Rohiney.

**Explanation:**

**Mooladeva and the Mandlika Thief:**

In the Gauda country, there was a city called Pataliputra. Its central part was invisible, like the water of the ocean. The prince of that city, Mooladeva, was a source of many arts, the root of courageous intellect. He was a master of cunning, a friend of the poor and the orphan, skilled in diplomacy like Chanakya, clever at understanding the inner thoughts of others, handsome and charming like Kamadeva, a thief with thieves, a saint with saints, crooked with the crooked, and straight with the straight, a simpleton with simpletons, a clever one with the clever, a king with kings, a warrior with warriors, a gambler with gamblers, and a chatterbox with chatterboxes. His heart was as pure as a crystal gem. Therefore, he quickly understood the true nature of others. He would amaze people with his astonishing tricks, wandering around like a great, wise Vidhyadhar, fulfilling his desires. He had a great weakness for gambling. Because of this, his father humiliated him and banished him from home. So, he wandered and reached the city of Ujjayini, which shone like Devapuri. Using a magical pill, he became a hunchback and a dwarf. He would amaze people with many such tricks. Gradually, he gained fame there through his skills.

In the city of Ujjayini, there lived a beautiful courtesan named Devadatta, whose beauty and artistic skills put even the gods to shame. She was proficient in all the arts. There was no one in that city who could entertain her as well as she could entertain herself. When Mooladeva heard this, he set up camp near her house to attract her. He played music like a god, a Gandharva, or a Tumburu, early in the morning. When the sweet melody reached Devadatta's ears, she asked, "Whose voice is so sweet?" She was very surprised and sent her maid to find out. The maid immediately searched and told the courtesan, "Devi! He looks like a dwarf, but his voice is so good and his nature is so gentle that there is no one like him in this area."

The Story of Muladeva
Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 72

"There is no singer of her praise." Then Devadatta sent a hunchbacked maid named Madhavi to call him. "Most courtesans are lovers of art." Kubja went to him and said, "O Great One! Treasure of Art! My mistress is calling you with respect." To this, Muladeva said, "Kubja! I cannot come. Who can enter the house of a courtesan, who is under the control of a prostitute?" Saying this, Muladeva called Kubja close, and with a desire for amusement, using his artistic skill, laid her down on the earth and in a moment, removed her hunchback, making her straight and beautiful like the stalk of a lotus. When the hunchbacked maid, with her changed form, arrived happily, Devadatta was also stunned by her form and demeanor. She was surprised that her maid, who had received the boon of the gods, could become so beautiful. Therefore, Devadatta said to her, "For such a clever artist and benefactor, even cutting off your finger and offering it would not be a loss. Go, bring him here at any cost." The maid went to Muladeva and with sweet and clever words, brought the cunning king to the courtesan's place, entering through the designated path. Just as Madhava adorned Radha's place, so Muladeva adorned Devadatta's place. Seeing the dwarf, adorned with radiance and beauty, the courtesan considered him to be a secret deity and seated him on a seat with respect. After asking skillful questions, upon being healthy, a conversation full of wit, along with a sweet gathering, began, as a unity of their hearts.

At that time, a wise vina player, skilled in playing the vina, arrived. Devadatta, with great curiosity, had him play the vina. The vina player played the vina so beautifully, with clear grama and shruti sounds, that Devadatta began to dance and praise him. At that time, Muladeva, jokingly, said, "The people of Ujjayini are truly very skilled and discerning of good and bad qualities." Devadatta, with a questioning look, said, "What doubt is there? In the praise of the clever, there is a suspicion of mockery." He said, "What deficiency is there in a vina player like you? It would be surprising to say so. But I can say that this vina is pregnant, it has a bamboo splinter. How did you know?" When the people present asked this, Muladeva took the vina from him, pulled out a piece of stone from its bamboo, and showed it to everyone. Later, he repaired the vina and played it in such a sweet and melodious tone, as if he had poured nectar into the ears of the listeners. To this, Devadatta said, "O Treasure of Art! You seem to be an extraordinary man, in human form, you are the embodiment of Saraswati." The vina player also fell at the feet of Muladeva and said, "Blessed be, Master! I will learn to play the vina from you. Please grace me." Muladeva said, "I do not actually know how to play the vina, but I know those who know how to play the vina well." Devadatta asked, "What is their name? Where do they live?" Muladeva said, "In the east, in the city called Pataliputra, lives the great artist Vikramasen, I am his servant Muladeva, I always remain in his service." Meanwhile, a drama teacher named Vishvabhuthi also arrived. Devadatta introduced him, saying, "This is the embodiment of Bharata himself." Muladeva said, "It must be so. You must have taught him the arts." After that, they talked about Bharata's plays with Vishvabhuthi. In the course of the conversation, Muladeva found him arrogant. Only those who know superficially are like this." Muladeva thought to himself, "He thinks of himself as a scholar. But like gilding copper, I will give him a glimpse inside." Therefore, he spoke clearly and eloquently, pointing out the flaws in his explanation of Bharata's plays. To this, Vishvabhuthi became angry and began to speak nonsense. It is said that when ignorant teachers hear the questions asked by the clever or the learned, they become angry and hide their ignorance. Muladeva smiled and said, "Friend! It seems that you are a drama teacher for courtesans, not for others." Hearing this, he became speechless. Devadatta, with a smile in her eyes, said to the teacher, to erase his embarrassment, "You must be in a hurry to leave now, so later, after thinking peacefully, answer this expert on this subject." Vishvabhuthi said, "Devadatta! Now

The Story of Muladeva
Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 72

"It's time for me to act, I must go. If you wish, you can also get ready." Saying this, Vishvabhuuti left.

Afterwards, Devadatta ordered her maid, "We both need to bathe. So, call a skilled masseur." Hearing this, Dhoortaraj said, "Listen! There's no need to go far, I can massage myself." She said, "Do you know this art?" He said, "I don't know, but I know someone who does, in whose service I have been." At Devadatta's command, Shatpaak oil arrived immediately. Thus, the magical Vaman began to massage with oil. He massaged the Varaanagana's body with gentle, medium, and firm hands, appropriate for the location, so that her body experienced not only vigor and strength but also pleasure. Devadatta was impressed by his skill and thought to herself, "Oh! He has mastered all the arts. Not everyone can have such skill. He must be an extraordinary person." Attracted by his artistry, Devadatta, overwhelmed with emotion, suddenly fell at his feet. She said, "Swami! We believe that you are a noble man with virtues. But why do you deceive us and hide your true form? Please reveal yourself openly, don't deprive us of your true form. Even gods reveal themselves to their devotees when they insist." Hearing this, Muladeva took a magical pill from his mouth and revealed his form like a jester. Devadatta, with eyes filled with wonder, looked at his amazing form, beauty, and charming limbs, like those of Kamadeva, and said, "Thank you! By revealing yourself in the form of such a beautiful body, you have done me a great favor." Giving him a towel suitable for bathing, Devadatta lovingly began to massage oil on his body with her own hands. Then she rubbed fragrant substances on his forehead. Afterwards, they both bathed with a stream of hot water. After bathing, Muladeva wore the silk clothes given by Devadatta, and they both ate together, delicious food mixed with fragrant substances. Their friendship grew stronger. And they often discussed the secrets of art in private. Thus, quite some time passed. One day, seeing Muladeva in a happy mood, Devadatta said, "Nath! You have stolen my heart with your extraordinary qualities. Therefore, I pray, beautiful! Just as you have taken residence in my heart, so too, please come and reside in this house forever." To this, Muladeva said, "It is not appropriate to be attached to a stranger and a poor man like me. And if a Varaanagana becomes infatuated with a poor man's virtues alone, her profession will be ruined, and her family will also suffer." Devadatta said, "Don't make excuses. For a man like you, a lion-like hero, what is a country and what is a foreign land? For virtuous people, everywhere is their homeland. Those fools who want to make us their own with wealth, they are at least outside my heart. Therefore, Temple of Virtues! I tell you clearly that no one else can enter my heart except you. Therefore, fortunate one! My body, mind, and wealth are all dedicated to your feet, accept them." Thus, at Devadatta's insistent request, Muladeva agreed to her request, and they both began to enjoy themselves lovingly.

At that very moment, the gatekeeper came and said, "Swamini! It's time for the dance in the royal court." Devadatta took Muladeva with her to the royal court, disguised. In front of the king, Devadatta began to dance brilliantly, with gestures like those of Rambha. Muladeva played the Dundubhi, very beautifully and effectively, like Indra's Dundubhi player. The king was greatly impressed by Devadatta's classical dance with gestures and said, "Ask for a boon (prasad)." Devadatta asked for her boon to be kept safe in the treasury. Afterwards, she performed music and dance with Muladeva. The king, pleased, gave her beautiful ornaments and fine clothes as a reward. The gatekeeper of the Pataliputra king, Vimalsingh, said happily to the king, "Rajan! The intelligent artist Muladeva lives in Pataliputra. He must have either been given this artistic excellence, or stolen it. No one else can have such artistic excellence. Therefore, after Muladeva,

The Story of Muladeva
Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 72 | This should be given as a certificate of artistry. And the best among the dancers should be given a flag as a certificate. | The king also started giving accordingly. On this, Devadatta said - 'This is my guru. I will only accept the certificate etc. | if I have their permission.' The king also said - 'O blessed one! Instead of taking permission from him, give him permission.' The cunning Muladeva | said - 'Maharaja, as you are ordering, do so.' At that time, the cunning king played the veena in such an attractive way, as if | he was another celestial musician. Seeing this, Vimalsingh said - Dev! This must be Muladeva in disguise. Such | art cannot be in anyone else except Muladeva. Surely this is the same, it seems.' The king | said to Dhurtaraj, aiming at him - If this is the case, then he should reveal himself. I am eager to see Muladeva, who is like a gem. Muladeva immediately took out a magical pill from his mouth. From this, he appeared in his true form, coming out of the clouds | like the moon, extremely radiant. 'Now it is known that you are a complete artist.' Saying this | Vimalsingh embraced Dhurtasingh. Thereafter, Muladeva bowed to the king. The king also happily | honored him. Devadatta, who was devoted to Muladeva like Urvashi with Puruvar, was also spending her life with him, experiencing worldly pleasures. But Muladeva could not live without gambling. Due to destiny, even in a person of excellent qualities, some defect remains. Devadatta humbly requested him - 'Praneshwar! You should give up gambling.' But even after much persuasion, Muladeva could not give up that vice. It is true, it is very difficult to give up one's nature.
In the same city, there lived a wealthy merchant named Achal, who was like Dhanakuber and in appearance like Kamadeva himself; he loved Devadatta before Muladeva; and he enjoyed pleasures with her. He was jealous of Muladeva | and wanted to harass him by finding fault on some pretext or the other. Muladeva got wind of this. He also used to go to his house on some pretext or the other. The passion of passionate men does not usually subside even when they are overpowered by passion. One | day, Devadatta's mother said to her - 'Daughter! What is left with this poor gambler Muladeva? Stop loving him. Have a firm affection like Rambha for this wealthy merchant Achal, who gives you money every day.' Devadatta said - 'Mother! I am not only a lover of wealth, but I am a lover of qualities.' On this, the mother said angrily - 'Well, can there be any qualities in this gambler? Think right.' Devadatta said - Why are there no qualities in him? He is patient, generous, | sweet-tongued. He is an expert in many arts and sciences, he is a lover of qualities, he is a connoisseur of qualities himself, so how can I leave his shelter? I will not be able to give him up.' From then on, the cunning mother, proficient in the art of deception, started trying various ways to break her daughter's affection for Muladeva. When Devadatta asked for a garland of flowers for him, she would give her a garland of withered, stale flowers, when she asked for sherbet, she would pick up a bottle of colored water and give it to her, when she asked for a piece of sugarcane | she would give her a dull piece of bamboo; when she asked for sandalwood, she would give her a piece of kadamba. And on top of that, she would explain to her - 'Daughter! Don't be offended by what I am doing. As the dev (yaksha) is, so is the bali (offering) given to him. Just as a vine lives in great sorrow by taking shelter of a thorny tree, why are you taking shelter of him? In my | opinion, you should completely abandon the unworthy Muladeva. On this, Devadatta said angrily - 'Without even examining | who is worthy and who is unworthy?' The mother also said in an excited voice - 'Then why don't you test them?' | Devadatta happily ordered her maid to tell Achal - 'Today Devadatta wants to eat sugarcane, | so send sugarcane.' When the maid went and told the merchant Achal, he considered himself blessed and sent a cart full of sugarcane. Seeing the cart, the happy Kuttinini said to her daughter Devadatta - 'Look daughter! Achal is as generous as a Chintamani and gives the desired fruit. Think about it a little.' The dejected Devadatta said to her mother - Am I an elephant that a whole cart of sugarcane has been brought here for me to eat, including the root and leaves. Now you also ask Muladeva to send sugarcane for eating. Then you will know what the difference is between the two

The Story of Mūladeva

Yogaśāstra, Second Canto, Verse 72: What is the difference? The maidservant also told Mūladeva the same thing. The clever Mūladeva took 5-6 sugarcanes, cut off their roots and tops, and cleaned them. He removed the knots of the festival and made small pieces the size of two fingers, like amṛtakuṇḍikā. Then he perfumed and sanctified them with saffron, cardamom, camphor, and other fragrant substances, and placed them in bowls, piercing them on skewers. Devadattā, seeing this, said to her mother, "Mother, look, Mūladeva is like gold and brass, but there is no difference in the immovable!" The courtesan thought, "Just as a thirsty deer, deluded by the mirage, rushes towards it, so this daughter too, thirsty for passion, is rushing towards this cunning king under the influence of great delusion. Therefore, just as pouring hot water into the hole of a snake makes it come out immediately, I shall devise some such means by which this cunning one may leave the city." The courtesan conspired with Acala to expel Mūladeva from the city. They secretly consulted and decided, and told Acala, "Merchant! You should make a false excuse to go to another village and assure Devadattā that you are going to the village. Thinking you have gone to another village, the cunning Mūladeva will come fearlessly to Devadattā. At the very moment when he is enjoying carefree play with Devadattā, you should come here with all the necessary materials as per my signal and directly enter his chamber and humiliate him in any way, so that he will no longer be able to indulge in sensual pleasures with Devadattā like a partridge." Acala agreed to do so.

According to this plan, one day Acala said to Devadattā, "I am going to such-and-such a village." Saying this, he took the money and left. As soon as he left, Devadattā fearlessly let Mūladeva in. The courtesan summoned Acala with the servants. Hearing of Acala's sudden arrival, Devadattā hid Mūladeva under the bed, just as one hides leaves under a basket. Smiling, Acala sat on the bed and, making an excuse, said, "Devadattā! Today I am very tired, so I will bathe sitting right here with hot water. You get ready." The astonished and perplexed Devadattā, with a forced smile, said, "If you want to bathe, please go to the bathroom." Saying this, she tried to help him up with her hand. But Acala sat firmly on the bed. Meanwhile, the cunning king could neither come out from under the bed nor sit properly there. When the mind is uneasy, the faculties also tend to diminish. Then Acala said again, "Devadattā! I had a dream today that I bathed wearing the clothes I had on, right on the bed. So I have quickly come to fulfill that dream. If I can fulfill this dream, my auspicious prosperity will increase." Hearing this, the courtesan supported him, saying, "Dear, do so! Why don't you obey the command of your lord? Haven't you heard that chaste women act according to their husband's wishes?" Devadattā said to Acala, "Sir, it does not seem appropriate for a wise person like you to spoil this costly silken bedding." Acala said, "My dear, it is not right for you to show such miserliness. When women like you offer their bodies to their husbands, why do you worry about this bedding? What is lacking for one whose lord is Acala? What can lack salt for one whose friend is the ocean?" Thereupon, the Devadattā, who was under the control of wealth, massaged Acala's body with oil and bathed him right there on the bed. While bathing, Mūladeva became soaked with the dirty water, just as Canda, the servant of Mahādeva, became drenched while bathing him. The courtesan signaled the servants of Acala and prompted Acala to pull the cunning one from under the bed. Just as the Kauravas had pulled Draupadī by her hair, Acala angrily pulled Mūladeva by the hair and said, "You scoundrel! You consider yourself a moralist and intelligent, but how did you get trapped today? Now tell me, what punishment should I give you according to your deeds? If you want to indulge in sensual pleasures with a courtesan controlled by wealth, then just as a wealthy landlord buys a village and makes it his estate by giving money, in the same way, I will buy you and make you my slave."

The Story of Muladeva
Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 72 | Why doesn't he buy it by giving a lot of wealth? Muladeva also stood there with his eyes closed, speechless; at that time he was feeling his condition like that of a wolf who had lost his place. Achal suddenly thought that this Mahatma has come into such a situation due to fate; therefore, it is not appropriate to subdue him (control him by giving punishment). Therefore, he said to Muladeva - 'Muladeva! I forgive all the crimes you have committed till today. If you are grateful, then in return, do me a favor when the time comes.' Saying this, he left Muladeva.
Like an elephant wounded in battle, Muladeva left from there and quickly set off and in a short time he reached outside the village and took a bath in a great lake. After bathing, wearing washed white clothes, he was shining like the autumn season. Muladeva, mounted on the thought-shaped desire of doing good or bad to Achal, went from there towards Venat. On the way, a forest twelve yojanas long and full of ferocious animals went by, like a dear companion of misfortune. He wanted, just as a boat is helpful in crossing the great ocean, so may I get some help in crossing this long forest. Just at that time, as if it had dripped from the sky, a Brahmin named Takk suddenly appeared there with a food packet in his hand. Just as an old man gets support from a stick, so also the helpless Muladeva was very happy to get the support of this Brahmin. Muladeva said to the Brahmin - 'Vipra! You have met me by chance, like my shadow, helpless in this forest. Therefore, now both of us will talk enough and quickly cross this forest. The story removes the fatigue of the journey.' On this, the Brahmin asked, 'Mahabag! First tell me how far and where you have to go? And accept my friendship on the way. I have to go to the city called 'Virnidhan' on the other side of this jungle. Tell me where you have to go.' Muladeva said - I have to go to Venatata Nagar. As soon as the Vipra heard, he said - Then it is fine. Our path is the same for a long distance, so come, let's go. The sun, which scorched the head with its intense heat, came in the midday, by then both of them reached the bank of a lake. Muladeva washed his hands and face in it and sat down in a shady place to relieve his fatigue, where the sun did not reach. The Brahmin also opened his packet and took out food from it and started eating alone like a miser, by the water. The cunning one thought - 'This one has sat down to eat alone without giving me anything first. It seems he is very hungry. It is possible that after eating, he will give me.' But the Brahmin, contrary to his hope, immediately tied up his packet and stood up as soon as he finished eating. Muladeva thought - He will give it today or tomorrow. But the next day also the Brahmin ate alone in the same way. Three days passed for Muladeva in this hope only. Hope is life for men. When the time came for both of them to change their paths, the Brahmin said to the cunning king, 'Look, fortunate one! Now my path and yours are different. I am going on my way. May you be well.' On this, Muladeva also said - 'Vipravar! With your help, I have crossed this terrible forest, twelve yojanas long, like a kos. Now I will go to Venatata. If there is any work worthy of me, please tell me. My name is Muladeva. So tell me what is your name?' He said - 'My real name is Sadhdhar Vipra, people call me Nirghrun Sharma.' Saying this, companion Takk separated from Muladeva.
Now Muladeva walked alone on the way to Venatata. On the way, a village appeared like a resting place for creatures. Muladeva's intestines were churning with hunger. He entered the village and while wandering for alms, he got some black gram bakules from a house. He was taking them out of the village when a monk, who was observing a monthly fast, like a virtuous person, appeared coming from the front. Seeing him, Muladeva was very happy. He thought - 'By my own good fortune, I have met a great ascetic monk, like a vessel that saves from the sea, who saves from the ocean of the world.' He gave those black gram bakules to the monk, who was adorned with the three jewels, as alms with this feeling that 'the fruit of the tree of wisdom, which has been irrigated for a long time, has been received by me today.' After giving the donation, Muladeva said - 'Truly they are blessed;

The Story of Muladeva

Chapter Two of the Yoga Shastra, Verse 72: "Those who use the Bakula tree for their Parana (fast-breaking) are virtuous." Filled with joy at Muladeva's devotion, a god spoke from the sky, "O Blessed One! Compose half a verse and ask for whatever you desire." Muladeva composed the following half-verse and prayed to the god, "May I have a kingdom with a thousand elephants and the courtesan Devadatta." The god said, "So be it." Muladeva then bowed to the muni and went to the village, collected alms, and ate. Continuing his journey, he reached the banks of the river Vena. He stayed at a Dharmasala (rest house) there. Due to fatigue, he fell into a deep sleep. In the last watch of the night, while sleeping in blissful slumber, he had a dream: "The full moon entered my mouth." The same dream was also experienced by another traveler at the Dharmasala. He woke up upon seeing the dream and told it to the other travelers. One of the travelers, after considering the dream according to the science of dreams, said to him, "You will soon receive kheer (rice pudding) and ghee-soaked malpuas (sweet pancakes)." Hearing this, the traveler was delighted and said, "So be it." Indeed, even a jackal rejoices as if it were a festival when it finds berries. Dhoortaraj had also heard the interpretation of the dream, so he did not tell anyone about his dream. He thought, "If I tell people about the jewels in my mouth, they will only call them pebbles and stones." The traveler received malpuas to eat on the day of the Grihaachhadana festival. The fruits of dreams often manifest according to one's thoughts. Dhoortaraj also went to a garden early in the morning. There, he began helping a gardener who was weaving garlands of flowers. The gardener was pleased by this. Such acts are always pleasing to people. Taking flowers and fruits from the gardener, Dhoortaraj purified himself by bathing, etc., and went to the house of the dream-interpreter Pandit. Muladeva greeted the dream-interpreter Pandit and offered him flowers and fruits, then told him about his dream. The dream-interpreter, pleased, said, "My son! I will tell you the fruit of your dream at an auspicious time. Be my guest today." Saying this, he seated Muladeva with honor and provided him with food at the appropriate time. Afterward, the Pandit presented his daughter to Muladeva for marriage. Seeing this, Muladeva said, "Father! You are not familiar with my lineage, caste, etc., so why don't you consider these things before giving me your daughter?" The Upadhyaya said, "My son! Your lineage and qualities are evident from your appearance. Therefore, accept my daughter without delay." At the insistence of the Upadhyaya, Muladeva married his daughter. It was as if the main door to future success had opened. Then the Upadhyaya told him the fruit of his dream, saying, "You will become the king of this city seven days from today." Delighted, Muladeva stayed there. On the fifth day, he went outside the city and fell asleep under a champaka tree. Just as a tree without roots perishes, so too did the king of that city suddenly die without a son. Therefore, a search began for a new king. For this purpose, a horse, an elephant, an umbrella, a chamara (fly whisk), and a kalash (pot) were enchanted and paraded throughout the city by the king's servants, but no one worthy of being king was found. Truly, individuals possessing royal qualities are rare. Then, while parading outside the city, they reached the champaka tree where Muladeva was sleeping. Upon seeing Muladeva, the horse neighed, and the elephant trumpeted loudly. Understanding the significance, the royal servants immediately went to Muladeva, woke him up, adorned him with royal garments, and performed his coronation right there with the kalash. They then seated him on the back of the Jayakunjara elephant. Two golden fly whisks, like lightning bolts, were waved over Muladeva, creating a breeze. A brilliant white umbrella, like the clouds of autumn, adorned his head. The people rejoiced at the arrival of a new king, shouting cheers. Musical instruments resounded in all ten directions. Thus, Muladeva entered the city with great pomp and ceremony. As he dismounted from the elephant, the royal servants took him to the royal palace. They seated him on the throne kept there. At that moment, a divine voice was heard from the heavens: "This new king, named Vikram, endowed with divine grace and a repository of arts, has ascended the throne. Whoever does not obey this king will be punished as a mountain is shattered by a thunderbolt." Hearing this divine voice, all the people and ministers were stunned, amazed, and terrified. Just as the senses of a muni are subdued, so too were all the ministers forever under his control. Thus, slowly...

The Story of Muladeva
Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 72

The kingdom was being ruled peacefully and systematically. All the clouds of sorrow had dispersed, and the sun of happiness had risen. Due to his cordial behavior with the king of Ujjayini, a friendship had developed between them.

Meanwhile, Devadatta, upon witnessing the mockery of Muladeva by Achal, felt hatred towards Achal. One day, she found an opportunity and reprimanded Achal, "You foolish, money-blinded fool! Do you consider me your family woman? You behaved so lowly with Muladeva in my own house, in front of me. Remember, I will not forgive you for this. I will destroy you. You are not welcome in my house from today onwards." Thus, she scornfully banished Achal from her house.

After that, Devadatta went to the king and said, "Dev! I want to claim the boon that I have kept with you as a deposit." The king said, "Ask for any boon you desire, I am bound by my word." Devadatta requested the boon, "From today onwards, do not allow anyone to enter my house except Muladeva. Especially, impose a ban on Achal, as he often visits my place." The king said, "Alright, it shall be done. But tell me, why do you want to impose such a ban?" Upon this, Devadatta signaled Madhavi with her eyes to tell her everything. Madhavi narrated the entire incident from beginning to end. Upon hearing this, King Jitashatru's eyebrows furrowed. He angrily summoned the merchant Achal and said scornfully, "Fool! Listen carefully! These two are the jewels of my kingdom, my ornaments. You, blinded by your wealth, have disregarded my jewel like a stone. For this heinous crime, you are sentenced to death."

Upon hearing this, Achal sank into the earth out of shame. His face turned pale. He began to beg for his life, pleading before the king. He also apologized to Devadatta, looking at her with a timid gaze. Devadatta felt pity for him. She pleaded with the king to pardon his death sentence. The king ordered him, "Merchant! Your life will be spared only if you find Muladeva and bring him back here." Achal accepted the king's order, bowed, and departed from there. On one hand, the insult inflicted by Devadatta was gnawing at his heart, while on the other hand, like a lost treasure, he was relentlessly pursuing the search for Muladeva. But days passed, and he couldn't find any trace of Muladeva. Achal, the merchant, began to feel restless. In this hurry, he quickly loaded all his goods onto the wagons and set off with his caravan towards the country of Parasakul.

Meanwhile, Muladeva, now the king, began to think, "Without Devadatta, enjoying this kingdom's wealth feels bland to me, like tasteless food." Therefore, he sent a message with his clever envoy to King Jitashatru of Ujjayini, along with gifts for Devadatta. "Muladeva, enjoying the wealth of the kingdom, has sent this message to King Jitashatru through his envoy, 'Rajan! You might have forgotten my current name due to your familiarity with my previous name. I am the same Muladeva. You know how much love I have for Devadatta. Therefore, if she wishes, please send her to me.'"

Upon hearing the message, the king of Ujjayini said to the envoy, "Why did he need to make such a request to me? We have good relations with King Vikram. There is no difference between us. I didn't even know that this King Vikram is the former Muladeva. Otherwise, I would have gone to meet him myself and would have already sent Devadatta." Jitashatru immediately summoned Devadatta and said, "Mahabaghe! Your fortune has opened up. After a long time, your desire has been fulfilled. Muladeva, by the grace of God, has become King Vikram of Venatat. He has sent a message with his envoy specifically to call you. Therefore, you should go there immediately." Upon hearing this good news, Devadatta's face lit up with joy. With the king's permission, she departed with her entourage and necessary supplies and reached Venatat within a few days. She sent word to King Vikram about her arrival a day before entering the city. Therefore, King Vikram welcomed Devadatta with great pomp and ceremony, accompanied by music and drums.

The Story of Muladeva

Chapter Two of the Yoga Shastra, Verse 72: And then, with the same respect he showed his own mind, he took her to his vast royal palace. Now Devadatta began to live there. With Devadatta, Muladeva's days passed like silver and his nights like gold, filled with enjoyment. Meanwhile, the king, upholding the dharma of wealth and desire, and devoted to the Jinas, ruled his kingdom happily, caring for his people. 

Meanwhile, a steadfast merchant, laden with goods fit for purchase from the land of Parsakul, was returning, like a cloud full of water. By chance, he reached the city of Venatat. He set up camp in the city and, in a tray, filled it with precious diamonds, emeralds, rubies, pearls, coral, gems, and jewels, to present to King Vikramraja. The king recognized Achal as soon as he saw him. A clever man, like someone remembering a past life connection, instantly recognizes another. But Achal could not recognize Muladeva in his kingly guise. Truly, even a clown, when disguised, cannot be recognized by the simple-minded. 

After skillful questioning, the king asked the merchant, "Tell me, sir, where do you come from, and why? Who are you? What goods have you brought with you?" He replied, "O King, we come from Parsakul. We have brought goods from foreign lands to sell. Please grant me permission to show them to you." Out of curiosity, the king said, "Very well, I will come myself to see them." The merchant said, "If you would grace my humble dwelling, it would be a great honor." Who can understand the anger and joy of great men? The king went with the merchant to his camp. He opened all his goods, showing the king the jagat of madder, cloth, thread, and other goods he had brought. The king, seeing the goods, asked, "Is this all the goods you have?" "Yes, O compassionate one, this is all. Tell the truth, if there is more, you will be severely punished." The merchant said, "I speak the truth, this is all the goods I have." The king, repeating his words, said, "Look, tell me carefully. In our kingdom, those who cheat on taxes are given severe physical punishment." Achal said, "O compassionate one, we do not lie in front of others, so how could we lie in front of you?" Hearing this, the king said to his tax collector, "Take half the tax from this truthful merchant and search his goods thoroughly." At the king's command, the tax collectors, kicking the bamboo, lowered it inside and searched. They suspected some precious goods hidden among the ordinary goods. Suspecting this, the royal officials quickly searched the surrounding places where the goods were kept. They suspected both the merchant's goods and his wealth. Officials always reach the bottom of people's hearts and cities. Therefore, those officials were angry with the merchant, scolded him, and arrested him, accusing him of tax evasion. If even the king's vassals are arrested at the king's command, what could this merchant do? The royal officials presented him to the king in the royal palace, but the king released him from his bonds. Then the king took him aside in the palace and asked, "Do you recognize me? Who am I?" Achal said, "Who would be so foolish as not to recognize the sun that illuminates the world, and you?" "Stop flattering me, tell me the truth, do you know me or not?" Thus, at the king's insistence, Achal said, "O Lord, I do not know you." At this, the king called Devadatta and pointed her out to Achal. A person considers himself fulfilled when he sees his beloved ones, for it brings peace of mind to the proud. Seeing Devadatta, Achal was immediately ashamed and felt great sorrow in his heart, for the pain of being humiliated in front of a woman is more painful than death. Devadatta said to Achal, "This is the same Muladeva whom you wronged and who also caused me to suffer. By the grace of God, you are now in trouble. Your life is in danger. Yet, O noble son, he will forgive you. Such great men do not pay attention to trivial matters. They do not stoop to such lowliness as revenge." Hearing this, the merchant immediately fell at the feet of both the king and Devadatta, saying, "Please forgive all the offenses I committed at that time. In connection with that same offense, King Jitashatru of Ujjayini is angry with me. Will he also allow me to enter Ujjayini at your word?" Muladeva said, "Since Devadatta has shown you such kindness, I also forgive you.

The Tale of Muldev
Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 72

After that, the king, taking pity on him, sent one of his messengers with him to Ujjayini and had him convey the message to the king of Ujjayini to allow Achal to enter. Achal was ordered to go to Ujjayini with the messenger. The king of Avanti, upon hearing the message from King Muldev, allowed Achal to enter Ujjayini. For the reason for his anger had now ceased.

One day, some merchants, distressed by sorrow, gathered together and prayed to King Muldev, "Dev! You are constantly worried day and night for the protection of your subjects, but thieves and robbers come to this city and harass us by stealing, looting, and so on. These thieves are so arrogant that they come to steal from someone's house every night and break down walls like rats. Even the Kotwal is helpless in protecting our lives and property. What can we say, they roam around our houses as if they were their own, as if they had some magical power." To this, the king said, "People! Don't worry! I will soon find out who this wicked thief is, have him arrested, and give him a severe punishment." Thus, assuring them, the king departed. The king summoned the city magistrate to the royal court and ordered him, "Find out who all the thieves are in the city and catch them immediately and give them severe punishment." The city magistrate said, "Swami! Everything else is fine, but there is one thief who escapes like a demon as soon as he sees us. He cannot be caught." The king said, "Okay, I will see to it." That very night, the king, dressed in blue clothes like Baldev, went out into the city to observe the city. He went to all the places where thieves hid. After wandering around all day, the king got tired and slept in a ruined temple, just like a lion sleeps in a cave. At night, the leader of the thieves, named Mandak, a terrifying creature like a night-walking ghost, came there. Seeing the king asleep, he called out, "Who is sleeping here?" The thief leader, enraged, kicked the king who was sleeping like a lion. The king, with the intention of finding out the visitor's intentions, location, and wealth, replied, "I am a foreign traveler." Such people are usually not alert face-to-face. The thief said to the king, "Traveler! Come with me today, I will make you very rich." Alas, the ignorance of the intoxicated! The king, desiring wealth, followed the thief leader on foot. Even Janardana massages the feet of a donkey when it roars. The thief leader, taking the king with him, entered the house of a wealthy man. Like Rahu, who breaks into a house with a weapon and drinks nectar from a well, he took whatever good things he found in that house. The thief, ignorant, stole all the wealth and tied it up, placing it on the king's head. Just as a Shakini shows her belly, so the foolish thief showed the king all the wealth. The king, with the intention of killing the thief in his mind, took up the burden as the thief leader had said. For cunning people become very humble when they need something and become like demons when their work is done. Therefore, reaching a dilapidated garden, he entered it. Like a scorpion kept in dung, he took the king inside the cave. Inside the cave sat a young woman, beautiful, adorned with grace and beauty, with a well-proportioned body, like a Naga Kumari Devi. She was his sister. The thief leader ordered his sister, "Wash this guest's feet." She took the king to a well nearby and seated him on a seat. Taking water from the well, the lotus-eyed maiden began to wash the king's feet. The touch of the king's soft limbs gave her pleasure. She looked carefully at all his limbs and thought to herself in amazement, "This is indeed Kamadeva himself. It is not right to kill him." She was very attracted to the king. She said to the king, "Great one! Under the pretext of washing your feet, I have thrown many men into this well. Where is compassion in the hearts of thieves? I am so attracted and impressed by your beauty that I will not throw you into this well. The influence of a great man is wonderful and captivating. Therefore, Swami! I request you to leave this place immediately, otherwise, neither of us will be safe." The king immediately got up and went out. Even though they are clever and powerful, they kill their enemies with intelligence. After the king had gone quite a distance, the girl shouted loudly, "Brother, he has run away, run, run quickly, he has gone." Intelligent people save their acquaintances or loved ones.

The Story of Rohiney
## The Story of Rohiney

The second light of the Yoga Shastra, verse 72, describes such methods. The Mandic thief, a member of the Kank tribe, with a sharp sword in his hand, ran swiftly behind the king, his tongue hanging out like a Vetala. The king, wise like Brihaspati, hid behind a stone pillar, standing alert, knowing the thief was approaching. With eyes red with anger, the Mandic thief, without looking or thinking, pierced the pillar with his Kank sword, mistaking it for a man, and returned to his place. The king, happy to know the thief's whereabouts, went to his palace. Who wouldn't be happy to see the one who troubles others caught?

In the morning, the king, the universal mind-bearer, went out under the pretext of strolling in the garden to find the thief. The Mandic thief was sitting in a cloth shop, working on stitching, with pieces of cloth wrapped around his thighs and calves, his mouth slightly open. Seeing the thief, whose form was deceitfully covered by clothes like a dung heap covered by Vasala, the king recognized him from the night before. The king immediately returned to the palace and called some trusted servants, described the thief's appearance, and said, "Bring the one with cloth bands tied on him, who is at such and such a place." The servant reached that place, looked carefully, and went to the thief, saying, "The king respectfully summons you." As soon as the thief heard this, he thought, "This must be the same man who escaped from me that time. He wasn't killed. This is the result of that, that the king is now calling me." Kings often recognize thieves. Thinking this, the thief went to the royal palace. The king seated him on a large seat near him. Because wise men who want to kill first offer great food to the person. Smiling faintly, the king said to him in sweet words, "Give me your sister. A daughter is meant to be given to others." Now the Mandic thief was certain that the king had seen his sister before, because no one else had been there except him. He said to the king, "O Lord! You take my sister in marriage. She is yours; and whatever I have is also yours." Just as Krishna married the devoted Rukmini, so the king married the beautiful Mandic sister. Then the king gave Mandic the position of chief minister. Who can know the depths of kings, like the depths of the ocean? Now the king would daily have clothes, ornaments, etc., brought to him from the Mandic thief's sister. "A cunning man is tricked by a cunning man." Gradually, when the king had collected a lot of wealth, he asked his wife one day, "My dear! How much wealth does your brother have left?" Mandic's sister said, "He had only that much wealth. Because there is nothing to hide from one's beloved." After this, the king, with his harsh orders, had the thief tortured and killed in many ways. Even though he was related to him, he had him killed.

Therefore, understanding that the bad fruit of theft is received in this life as well, in any way, a wise person should always avoid theft.

## Rohiney, from Thief to Saint

In the city of Rajgriha, which surpassed the beauty of Amaravati, King Shrenik ruled, served by many kings. Like the wise son of Krishna, Pradyumna Kumar, this king had a son who was valiant in policy and strength. His name was Abhay Kumar. In those days, in the cave of Vaibhargiri, there lived a famous thief named Lohkhur, who was like a living embodiment of fierce anger. When the men and women of Rajgriha went to some festival or other, he would quietly go behind them like a ghost, create havoc, and steal wealth from there. He considered the city his own storehouse or home. He would rape any beautiful woman he saw. He was only interested in the business of theft, and his mind did not settle on any other livelihood. It is true that a carnivore is not satisfied with any food other than meat. His wife's name was Rohini. He had a son, like himself in appearance and behavior, whose name was Rohiney. At the time of his death, the father called him and said, "Son! I will tell you one thing, promise to do as I say." He said, "Father! I will certainly do as you say." In this world, there is no transgression of a father's command.

The Story of Rohiney
Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 72 | "Who will do it?" Upon hearing his son's words, Lohkhur was overjoyed. He stroked his son's head and said cruelly, "Look! The Mahavira preaches Dharma in the Samavasarana created by the Devas. Never listen to his words. You are free to do whatever you want besides that." Thus, having assured his son, Lohkhur died. After performing his father's death rites, Rohiney surpassed his father. He too began to steal day and night, as if he were another Lohkhur. Heeding his father's command, disregarding his own life, he stole in the city of Rajgriha like a slave's son.
Once, while traveling through villages and cities, the last Tirthankara, Bhagwan Mahavira Swami, accompanied by 14,000 sadhus, arrived in the city of Rajgriha, his lotus feet resting on a golden lotus. The Devas and Devis of all four realms together created the Samavasarana.
One day, the Lord was preaching in his Yojanagamini, nectar-showering voice, which could be understood by all languages. By divine chance, Rohiney was going towards Rajgriha for some work at that time. The Lord's Samavasarana was on the way. Therefore, Rohiney thought, "If I go by this route, I will surely hear Mahavira's words, which will also violate my father's command. But there is no other way either." Thinking this, Rohiney covered his ears with both hands and hurried towards Rajgriha. In this way, while going, one day, he suddenly stepped on a thorn near the Samavasarana. Due to his haste, the thorn went deep. He felt great pain. He could not move without removing it. Consequently, he removed his hands from his ears to remove the thorn and took them down to his feet to pull it out. During this time, the Lord's words reached his ears - "The Devas remain four fingers above the earth without touching it. Their eyelids do not blink, their garlands do not wither, and their bodies do not have dirt or sweat." Hearing this, he began to repent - "Oh! I have heard so many words, damn me!" Saying this to himself, he quickly pulled out the thorn, covered his ears with both hands again, and continued walking. In this way, he, the thief, came and went to Rajgriha every day and stole.
One day, the wealthy people of the city came to King Shrenik and complained - "Your Majesty! We have no other trouble in your kingdom, which is ruled by a just king like you, but there is one great hardship, that thieves steal our wealth and disappear. Even after searching, we cannot find them." Hearing the suffering of his subjects, King Shrenik, who was grieved like a brother, angrily said to the Kotwal, "It seems you are neglecting the thieves, becoming their partners, eating my salary, and doing the work of the thieves. In this way, the people's wealth is being stolen day by day." The Kotwal said sorrowfully, "What should I tell you, Dev! There is a thief named Rohiney who is looting the citizens. He is so cunning that he jumps like a monkey, like the flash of lightning, from one house to another, and from there he easily crosses the fort. We reach there, but by then he has disappeared. We take one step, he takes a hundred steps. We have no control over catching and killing that thief. It is difficult to even see him, let alone catch him. If you wish, you can take our authority as Kotwal from us." Hearing this, the King, with a gesture of his eye, signaled Abhaykumar to catch the thief. He said to the Kotwal, "Kotwalji! Today, keep the Chaturangini army ready outside the city. When the thief enters the city, surround him with the army from all sides. He will be caught like a frightened deer, while being electrocuted inside. Therefore, when he comes, as soon as his arrival is known from the sound of his feet, let the alert soldiers catch that great thief." "Your command is on my head." Saying this, the Kotwal left from there. The intelligent Kotwal secretly prepared the army. By coincidence, Rohiney had gone to another village that day. Therefore, he did not know about the army's encampment outside the city, and just as an unaware elephant falls into a pit, Rohiney fell into the army's encirclement and was caught. He entered the city along with the encirclement. By this strategy, the thief was caught and tied up, and the Kotwal...

The Tale of Rohiney
The second light of Yoga Shastra, verse 72, entrusted the king with the case. The king commanded, "Just as justice protects the righteous and punishes the wicked, punish him accordingly." To this, Abhaykumar said, "Your Majesty! He was caught alone, without having committed any theft. Therefore, one should think carefully about this before punishing him." Thus, the king asked Rohiney, "Tell me, where are you from? What is your profession? What is your purpose in coming here? Are you not a Rohiney?" Hearing his name, he became suspicious and thought to himself for a moment before telling the king, "I am a farmer named Durgachand from Shali village. I had come to Rajgriha for some work, and due to the late hour, I spent the night in a temple out of curiosity. Before dawn, when I was returning home, a royal demon, like a demon, surrounded and captured me while crossing the fort. I fear for my life the most. Just as a fish that has escaped from the hands of a fisherman is caught in a net, so too have I, who escaped from the clutches of the royal demons patrolling the city, been caught by the demons outside. Then, even though I am innocent, they brought me here, considering me a thief. Now, please act as a judge and give me justice." Hearing his words, the king sent a trusted man to investigate his village, and ordered Rohiney to be kept in prison until then.
The thief had already sent a signal to his village. Thieves also have some knowledge of the future. When the royal men went to that village and inquired, the villagers said, "Yes, a farmer named Durgachand used to live here, but he has gone to another village." The royal men came back and told the king the whole truth. Upon this, Abhaykumar thought, "Even the Creator cannot know the truth of the cunningly crafted arrogance." Therefore, Abhaykumar called a skilled craftsman, explained the entire plan to him, and secretly had him build a seven-story palace, like a precious, gem-studded divine aircraft. When it was finished, it looked as if a piece of Amaravati from Devalok, adorned with Apsara-like beautiful women, had fallen down here. When the Gandharvas gathered there and started a musical festival with music, dance, and instruments, the palace took on the wondrous beauty of Gandharvanagar. After all this, one day, Abhaykumar made the thief drink Chandras, a white, milk-like liquor, and made him unconscious. In his unconscious state, he was dressed in divine clothes and taken to that palace and laid on a flower bed like that of the gods. When he regained consciousness and sat up, he saw a gathering of divine women and divine princes around him, heard the sound of sweet music, songs, and dance, and began to look with wonder-filled eyes. As per Abhaykumar's prior instructions, the divinely-dressed women present raised their voices in cheers and said, "You have just been born in this great aircraft in the form of a god. You are our master, we are your servants. Like Indra, you should play with these divine women to your heart's content." Thus, they spoke with cunning and affectionate words. The thief thought, "Am I a god?" At that moment, all the women clapped their hands and started playing music with rhythm and beat. Then, a man with golden ornaments came there and said, "What have you started?" They said to the gatekeeper, "We are showing our master our scientific skills." He said, "It is good to show your master your scientific skills, but make sure they follow the customs of Devalok." Then they asked, "What customs?" Hearing this, the man showed his authority and said, "Wow! Have you forgotten this too? Here, whoever is born a new god, they are first asked about their good and bad deeds in their previous birth, and then they are given the freedom to enjoy heavenly pleasures. Oh! In the joy of the new master's benefit, we forgot to tell them this." Then, they went to the thief and said, "Master! You are pleased with us, so please follow the customs of Devalok. Here, whoever is born, it is necessary to first tell them about their good and bad deeds in their previous birth, and then they are given the freedom to enjoy heavenly pleasures. This is the custom here." The thief said, "Is this really Devalok, or is this a web of illusion created by Abhaykumar to trap me? Is it not possible that this is a trick to find out my secret? What should I say to them?" At that moment, while removing the thorn, he heard...

## The Story of Rohiney

**Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 72** | The words of the Lord came to mind. If his form resembles the divine form I heard from Lord Mahavira, then I will tell the truth. If not, I will fabricate a lie. Thinking this, the thief observed his feet touching the ground, his eyelids blinking, his garland of flowers wilted, and sweat and dirt on his body. Seeing all this, he thought, "This is all an illusion." Therefore, he began to think about his answer. Then the divine beings spoke to him again, "Dev! Tell us about your past life, we are eager to hear." Rohiney said, "In my previous birth, I gave worthy donations. I made many pilgrimages. I served and worshipped the Lord and the Guru. I performed many other righteous deeds." The guard interrupted, "Now tell us about your misdeeds." Rohiney said, "Due to constant association with the virtuous, I have not done anything wrong in my life." The guard said, "A man's nature does not remain the same throughout his life. Therefore, reveal any wrong deeds you may have committed in your life, such as theft, adultery, etc." Rohiney said, "Can someone who commits such evil deeds ever attain heaven? Can a blind man climb a mountain?" Hearing his words, they all fell silent and went to Abhaykumar and told him the whole story from beginning to end.

Hearing the whole account, Abhaykumar pleaded with King Shrenik, "Your Majesty! We have investigated this matter in many ways, but we cannot prove him to be a thief. Perhaps he is a thief, but how can we apprehend him according to the law if he is not caught in the act? Therefore, we should release him while upholding the principles of justice." As per the King's order, Abhaykumar released Rohiney. Even the most intelligent people are deceived by those skilled in cunning.

Now Rohiney began to think, "My father unjustly ordered me not to listen to the saintly words, depriving me of the nectar of the Lord's words for a long time. If the Lord's words had not reached my ears, how could I have understood this web of artificial deities and how could I have escaped from their trap so cleanly? I would have been finished by now, beaten by them. Even though I heard them unwillingly, those divine words have become a life-giving medicine for me today. Shame on me! I have rejected the words of Arhan and accepted the words of thieves, fallen for their words, and loved them. Just as a crow prefers to sit on neem trees instead of mango trees, I have preferred my father's words over the Lord's words for a long time. Then I heard a small part of the Lord's teachings, and I received such great benefits. If I had listened to all the teachings with interest, how much benefit would I have received?" Thinking these auspicious thoughts in his mind, Rohiney went straight to Lord Mahavira and, after bowing at his lotus feet, prayed, "Lord! In this ocean of the world, filled with aquatic creatures in the form of terrible calamities, your guiding words act as a great vessel (ship). My uncivilized father, who considers himself a righteous man, has forbidden me from listening to your words until now. Therefore, I, the unfortunate one, have been deprived of the words of the world teacher. O Lord of the Three Worlds! Truly, those men are blessed who, with faith, always drink the nectar of your words with their lips. What a sinner I am, that I blocked my ears with my fingers and crossed this place, not wanting to hear your words. Once, unwillingly, I heard some of your words. It was due to the influence of those mantras that I escaped from the clutches of the king's demon. O Lord! Just as you protected me from death, so now save me from drowning in the whirlpool of the ocean of the world."

The compassionate Lord, hearing his humble prayer, preached to him the pure path of the virtuous, the giver of liberation. Awakened by this, Rohiney the thief bowed and respectfully asked, "Lord! Am I worthy of the path of a monk?" Please tell me." The Lord said, "Rohiney! You are worthy!" Hearing this, Rohiney said, "Lord! Then I will surely accept the great vows." In the middle of this, King Shrenik said, "I have something to say." Then he said to the thief, "Rohiney! Now you are about to be initiated into the Lord's feet, so I forgive you for your misdeeds."

## The Fruit of Abstaining from Theft

**From the second chapter of the Yoga Shastra, verses 73 to 75:**

"But you should be at ease and without any doubt, tell your entire life story as it is." Hearing this, Rohiney, the son of Lohkhur, said, "O King! What you have heard from people about me is true, I am Rohiney, the thief. I was a thief in this city without any hesitation. Just as a river is crossed by a boat, I crossed the river of distress, born from the intellect of Abhaykumarji, with the boat of the Lord's nectar-like words. I have stolen so much in this city that no other thief can even investigate me. Please send a trustworthy person with me so that I can tell him about all the stolen goods and hand them over. After that, I will take initiation and make my birth successful. I apologize to all of you for my crimes."

By the order of King Shrenik, Abhaykumar and some prominent citizens went with Rohiney out of curiosity. He dug up all the places where he had buried wealth, including mountains, rivers, forests, trees, cremation grounds, etc., and handed it over to the king. Abhaykumar also returned the wealth to its rightful owners. There is no other injustice in the ministers who are selfless and righteous. After that, the devout Rohiney went to his relatives. He enlightened them about renunciation, detachment, and altruism, and then he himself went to the feet of the Lord. King Shrenik celebrated Rohiney's initiation ceremony with great pomp. At the right time, in an auspicious moment, he accepted the Bhagavati initiation from Lord Mahavira. After taking initiation, Rohiney Muni performed pure austerities, including fasting for one day to six months, to destroy his karma. As his body became thin and weak due to austerity, he performed the worship of Sanlekhana with devotion and, with the permission of Lord Veeraprabhu, performed the fast called Padupopgaman on Mount Vipulachal. In the end, remembering the Panchparmeshthi with auspicious meditation, Rohiney Mahamuni left his body through Samadhi-maran and reached the Devaloka.

In this way, a person who turns away from the act of theft, like Rohiney, attains heavenly bliss in a short time. Therefore, wise men should never commit theft, which spoils both lives. ||72||

Now, instructions are given on abandoning the faults arising from theft. ||129||

"It is far from the point to attempt to steal someone's entire wealth. One should not even take a single blade of grass without giving it." ||73||

Meaning: One should not even think of stealing someone's wealth, let alone actually doing it. One should not even take a single blade of grass without giving it. One should not even try to do so. ||73||

Now, the fruit of abstaining from theft is explained in two verses. ||130||

"Those who, with pure minds, make it a rule not to take what belongs to others, wealth comes to them on its own, like a self-choosing bride; it is not obtained through another's influence or through business and trade." ||74||

Meaning: Those who, with pure minds, make it a rule not to take what belongs to others, wealth comes to them on its own, like a self-choosing bride; it is not obtained through another's influence or through business and trade. ||74||

See also. ||131||

"Misfortunes go far away from those who practice the vow of non-stealing. They receive praise from people for their honesty, saying, 'This man is honest.' He is praised in this world and also attains heavenly bliss in the next world." ||75||

Meaning: Misfortunes go far away from those who practice the vow of non-stealing. They receive praise from people for their honesty, saying, 'This man is honest.' He is praised in this world and also attains heavenly bliss in the next world. ||75||

Explanation: According to the context, the meaning of some verses is being given here.

Drinking the flame of fire, kissing the mouth of a serpent, and licking the poison of Halahal is good, but stealing someone else's wealth is not good. The mind of one who has greed for another's wealth often becomes cruel. He becomes ready to kill even his brother, father, uncle, wife, friend, son, and guru. Like a stick raised to kill a cat that wants to drink milk, one who steals another's wealth cannot escape his own death-bond. A thief is worse than a hunter, fisherman, cat, etc. Because the king arrests him, but not other creatures. Therefore, a wise man should consider even the gold, jewels, etc., that are lying in front of him, as stones. In this way,

Maithunaservana se jivahimsa
Yogashastra dvitiya prakasha sloka 76 se 79 | Santosa rupee sudharasa se tript grihastha svarga prapat karata hai ||5||

Arthah:- Samajhdara grihastha upasaka paraloka me napumsakata aura ihaloka me raja ya sarakara adi dvara indriyadchhedana adi abrahmacaryya ke kadave phala dekhakara ya shastradadi dvara janakar parastariyon ka tyaga kare aura apani stri me santosa rakhe ||76||

Vyakhya:- Yadyapi angikara kiye hue vrata ka palana karate hue grihastha ko itana papa samparaka nahim hota, phira bhi sadhudharma ke prati anuragee, sadhudiksha graha na karne se pahale upasaka grihastha jivana me bhi kamabhoga se virakta hokar shravakadharma ka niratichara palana karata hai ||6||

Vairagya ke shikhara para pahuncane ke liye abrahmacaryya se nivritta hona jaruri hai. Atah ab abrahmacaryya-sevana ke dosa bataate hain ||133||

Rammyamapatamatramatra yat parinameatidaruna | Kimpakaphalasankasham, tat kah seveta maithuna? ||77||

Arthah:- Maithuna-sevana prathama praarambha-maatra me bada raman iya aura sundara lagataa hai, kintu uska parinaam kimpakaphalasadrisya bahuta bhayankara hai. Aisi dasha me kauna usa maithuna ka sevana karega? ||77||

Vyakhya:- Kimpakavruksha ka phala varna, gandha, rasa aura sparsha me bada manohara, madhura aura sugandhi lagataa hai, khane me bhi svadishta hota hai. Mana ko bhi santosa milata hai; magar khane ke baada vaha vyakti ji bhi nahim sakata; kuchha hi deri me vaha prana le leta hai. Isi prakaara vishayasukha sevana karate samaya bade manohara hridaya ko shanti dene vaale hote hain. Kintu baada me unaka parinaam bahuta hi bhayankara aataa hai. Isaliye kahate hain-anekadoshonam aashraya-bhuta janakar kauna maithuna ka sevana karega? ||77||

Ab maithuna-sevana ke bhayankara parinaamon ka varnana karate hain ||134||

Kampah sveda shrama murchha, bhramiglanirbalaaksayah | Rajayakshmaadi rogash ca, bhaveyur maithunottthitah ||78||

Sheshavrata bhi jaise ahimsa me samavishta ho jaate hain, usi tarah yaha brahmacaryya bhi hai. Isaliye maithuna me ahimsa ka abhava hai, ise kahate hain ||135||

Yoniyantrasamuttpanna, susukshma janturaashayah | Pidyamana vipadyante, yatra tanmaithuna tyajet ||79||

Arthah:- Yoni rupee yantra me aneka sukshmatar jantu utpanna hote hain. Maithuna-sevana karane se ve jantu mar jaate hain. Isaliye maithuna-sevana ka tyaga karna chahiye ||79||

Vyakhya:- Prani ko janma dene ka marga ya utpattisthana yoni kahalaata hai. Vaha yantrakara hone se use yoniyantra kahate hain. Usmem svabhavatah utpanna hone vaale samacchhima jiva itane sukshma hote hain ki aankho se nahim dikhayee dete. Iska spashtikarana karane ke liye drishtanta dete hain-ruee se bharii huee nalee me tapee huee lohe ki salaee ruee ko jala detee hai; usee tarah garam yoni me ruee ke samana rahe hue jeevasamuha purushachihn ke mardana se maithuna karane par nashta ho jaate hain. Isaliye maithuna-sevana aneka jeevanam ki himsa ka janakahoneseta tyajya samajhana chahiye. Anya shastroam me bhi yoni me jantuvom ka hona bataaya gaya hai. Jaise ki Vatsyayana rachita Kamashastra me bhi yoni me jantuvom ka astitva maana hai. 'Jantusadbhava iti Vatsyayanoapyaha'-arthaat Kamashastra-rachayi ta Vatsyayana ne bhi kaha hai ki yoni me jantuvom ka sadbhava hai. Kahane ka tatparya yaha hai ki kama ko pradhanata dene vaale Vatsyayana ne bhi yoni me jantuvom ka hona sveekarakar liya hai, chhipaaya nahim; tab dusaroam ka to kahan a hee kya? ||79||

The various harms from cohabitation with women of bad character
Yogashastra, Second Illumination, Verses 85-88.

[85] The depth of the boundless ocean can be fathomed, but the character of crooked women cannot be.

[86] The unchaste women, in a moment, can implicate their husband, son, father, and brother even in criminal acts, putting their lives in danger.

[87] Woman is the seed of the world, the lamp illuminating the path to hell, the root of sorrows, the foundation of the Kali age, and the mine of miseries.

[88] Their mind is one thing, their speech another, and their actions yet another. How can such common women, like courtesans, be the source of happiness?

[89] Who would kiss the face of a courtesan, whose mouth is polluted by the mixture of meat and liquor, and partake of the leftover as food?

Harms of Associating with Unchaste Women

Yogashastra, Second Canto, Verses 89-94:

1. Who would want to kiss the false and dirty mouth of a prostitute, which is like stale and foul-smelling food, due to meat-eating, drinking alcohol, and being kissed by many lovers? (89)

2. Even after a lustful man has given away all his wealth to a courtesan, when he becomes destitute, the prostitute desires to snatch away even the clothes he is wearing as he departs. (90)

3. The man addicted to a courtesan neither respects the gods, nor the gurus, nor his friends and relatives, for he delights only in bad company. (91)

4. The courtesan, driven by the desire for wealth, looks upon even lepers as if they were Cupid, and displays feigned affection, but the wise should renounce such a heartless courtesan from a distance. (92)

5. Even the followers of the ascetic path should not serve their own wives with attachment, let alone the wives of others, which are the source of all sins. (93)

6. A woman who abandons her husband and indulges in an illicit relationship with another man, how can one have trust in the fickleness of her mind? (94)

The Fault of Going to Another's Wife
From the Yogashastra, Second Illumination, Verses 95-98.

95. The one whose mind is disturbed and in a bad state due to attachment to another's wife, cannot engage in rati (sensual pleasure) with her, just like a sacrificial animal (about to be slaughtered). Therefore, the attachment of a virtuous householder towards another's wife is completely unacceptable.

96. One should renounce going to another's wife, as it causes doubt about one's life, is the root cause of enmity, and is opposed to both this world and the next world.

97. The one who goes to another's wife may sometimes face complete confiscation of his wealth, binding with ropes, and mutilation of his body parts. And after death, he attains the terrible hell.

98. The man who constantly strives to protect his own wife knows the suffering involved in it. How then can he go to another's wife, knowing all this?

The terrible sins of Vaishyaagaman and Parastriigaman, the story of Ravana
Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 99: Knowing this, how can a wise man engage in Paradaaragaman? Let alone Parastriigaman, even thinking about another woman is a great sin. ||96|| This is explained. ||155|| Even though he shook the entire world with his prowess, Ravana, despite having his own wife, abducted Sita Sati out of lust and looked at her with lustful eyes. This led to the destruction of his lineage, the end of Lanka, and he went to hell after death. Even such a great warrior faced the consequences of his actions, so what chance does anyone else have of not facing the consequences of Parastriigaman? ||99|| Therefore, one should learn from this. The mere desire for Parastriigaman led Ravana to hell:
In the island called Rakshasa, on the peak of the Trikut mountain, which is like the crown jewel of the earth, there was a vast city called Lanka, made of gold. There ruled King Ravana, the jewel of the Polasthya lineage, a great warrior who shook the world with his prowess, the lord of the Vidyadharas. He had two brothers, Kumbhakarna and Vibhishana, who were like pillars of strength. One day, he saw a garland adorned with nine gems, inherited from his ancestors. As if it were the family goddess, Ravana looked at it with wonder and asked the elders there, "Where did this garland come from? What is special about it?" They said, "This garland was obtained by your ancestors as a boon. It is a very essential and valuable garland of gems. The special thing about this garland is that whoever wears it will become half-lord. Thus, according to the family tradition, the king has been wearing this garland. According to this custom, your ancestors also worshipped it. Hearing the importance of the garland, Ravana put it on his neck." As soon as he put it on, the reflection of Ravana's face appeared in the nine gems. Due to this, instead of one face, ten faces appeared. This is why Ravana became known as Dashmukha. From then on, people greeted Ravana with the words "Jai Jai". At that time, he seemed to be excited for conquering the world. Ravana possessed perfect knowledge like Pragyapti, etc., which was like a well-trained army acquired through intense practice. Due to this, he easily conquered the difficult half-Bharat region, as if conquering a village; yet, his desire for kingdom, like an itch, did not subside.
Indra, the king of the Vidyadharas, who had experienced Indrahood in his previous birth, was a master of many arts and ruled on the Vaithadya mountain. Due to the excess of wealth and power in the world and the practice of Indrahood in his previous birth, he became proud and considered himself as Ahminndra. He named his queen Shachi, his weapon Vajra, his elephant Airavata, his horse Matali, and his four great generals Soma, Yama, Varuna, and Kubera. Because he considered himself Indra, he considered others as insignificant as straw. Being a fierce warrior, he considered even Ravana as insignificant in front of him. When the powerful Ravana, who was as strong as Yama, came to know this, he became angry and roared like the clouds of Shravan, and went to fight the said Indra king. With the power of knowledge, he crossed the sea with an army of water, land, and sky, and arrived at Vaithadya like a storm of the apocalypse, the dust from the whirlwind of his army covering the sky. Seeing Ravana approaching, Indra also came forward, because it is the first duty of men to face each other in friendship and enmity. The mighty Ravana sent a messenger to Indra, conveying a message in sweet words, "There have been many rulers here who are proud of their strength or are Vidyadharas. All of them have sent gifts and served King Dashkandha Ravana. Due to being forgotten by Ravana and your simplicity, 1. In other texts, it is mentioned that the garland was worn around the neck at the time of birth.

The Tale of Ravana

Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 99:

"So much time has passed. Now is the time to serve them. Therefore, either show your devotion to them, or show your strength by fighting them. If you do not show either devotion or strength, your everything will be destroyed."

The king, hearing this, said to the messenger, "The poor, weak kings must have served him with devotion. No powerful ruler has dared to face him. Now, intoxicated with power, he wants me to serve him and worship him. Until now, Ravana's time has passed peacefully. Now it seems that the days of his destruction are left. Therefore, go to your master and tell him that if he wishes well, he should show devotion to me, otherwise, he should show his strength. If he does not show either devotion or strength, then understand that his destruction is certain."

The messenger went and told Ravana the whole truth. Hearing this, Ravana, filled with rage, became like the turbulent sea of the apocalypse. With his infinite army like surging waves, he arrived on the battlefield. The armies of both sides began to fight with great force. The shower of weapons from both sides seemed like the rain of clouds during the Samvartaka Pushkara Avarta.

After saluting Ravana, Ravana's son, Meghnad, challenged Indra to battle. "A valiant man does not give way to anyone in the game of war." To decide who would be victorious, the armies of both sides were moved away, and Ravana's son and Indra, both valiant warriors, engaged in a duel. Both crossed the river of war, striking each other with weapons. They quickly dodged each other, making it difficult to tell whether Meghnad was above or below, or whether Indra was above or below. Victory, frightened, went to Indra for a moment, and then to Meghnad in the next. Just as Indra, puffed up with pride like a musk deer, was about to strike, Meghnad attacked him with all his might. Immediately, Meghnad knocked Indra down and bound him. "The first reason for the victory of a man who desires victory is haste."

With a roar that shook the sky, Meghnad, like a living victory, handed the bound Indra over to his father, Ravana. Ravana also imprisoned him in a strong, secure prison. For the strong one does both - he kills and he protects.

At that moment, enraged by the capture of Indra, Yama, Varuna, Soma, and Kubera, the four Indra Subhats, immediately arrived and surrounded Ravana. Ravana, desiring victory, became four times more enthusiastic and clashed with the four Subhats. First, he broke the staff of the staff-bearer (Yama). Then he shattered Kubera's mace. After that, he broke Varuna's bow of the ocean. Just as a big elephant overpowers a small elephant, Ravana overpowered the four so much that they were completely defeated. Then, for the destruction of the enemy, he bound the four.

Taking Indra with him, along with the seven limbs of the kingdom, Ravana marched to conquer Patala Lanka. He killed the king of Chandrodya there and gave his kingdom to Khara, who had three heads and was strong in deceit. Khara, a strong and powerful man, took possession of all the palaces of Chandrodya. Only one pregnant queen escaped. After that, Ravana, the king of Lanka, returned to Lanka from Patala Lanka and made his kingdom, which was like thorns to the gods, thornless. [In other stories, it is described that Khara himself conquers the kingdom of Patala Lanka.]

Once, Ravana was going for a pleasure trip in his Pushpaka Vimana, when he saw the Marut king performing a great sacrifice. To see his sacrifice, Ravana descended from his Vimana and reached the sacrificial ground. The Marut king welcomed Ravana with a throne and other things. In the course of conversation, Ravana said to the Marut king, "Brother! Why are you performing this violent sacrifice that takes people to hell? The omniscient, benevolent gods who are well-wishers of the three worlds have declared non-violence as the dharma. Then how can dharma be achieved through this sacrifice, which is impure due to the killing of animals? Therefore, do not perform this sacrifice, which is like an enemy who spoils both worlds. If you reject my words and perform a sacrifice in the future, then..."

1. In another story, there is a description of Ravana binding Indra.
2. In one story, there is a description of Narada telling Ravana.

## The Exile of Ramachandra

**Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 99**

"In this world, your dwelling will be in my prison, and in the afterlife, your dwelling will be in hell." Having understood everything well, Marutraja immediately stopped the yagna. Because in the world, he had to obey the command of the powerful and mighty Ravana. After stopping the yagna from Marut, Ravana, swift as the wind, went on a journey to the holy places of Sumeru, Ashtapada, etc. After completing his journey to the Chaityas, considered eternal and non-eternal, he returned to his place.

Meanwhile, in Ayodhya, there was King Dasharatha, the possessor of immense wealth and a great warrior. He had four queens, Kaushalya, Sumitra, Kaikeyi, and Suprabha, who were like the Lakshmi of the four directions. From Queen Kaushalya, Rama was born; from Kaikeyi, Bharata; from Sumitra, Lakshmana; and from Suprabha, Shatrughna. These four princes, Rama, Lakshmana, Bharata, and Shatrughna, shone like the four tusks of Indra's Airavata elephant. Upon reaching adulthood, Ramachandra married Sita, the daughter of King Janaka and the sister of the earth, after stringing the bow.

One day, King Dasharatha sent consecrated water to his four queens for the auspicious worship of the Jain Tirthankara. Kaushalya received the water late. Due to this, she became angry. To appease her, King Dasharatha himself went to her. At that time, he saw an old, dilapidated servant in the inner palace, whose teeth were shaking like the pendulum of a clock. His head was trembling, causing his mouth to move. His entire body was covered with silver-white hair. His eyes were covered by the eyebrows, as if he was begging for death from Yama. He was stumbling with every step. Seeing him, the king fell into thought - "May my condition not be like this. Before that, I should practice the fourth purushartha - Moksha."

King Dasharatha wanted to embrace the great vow. Therefore, to establish his eldest son in his place, he called Rama and Lakshmana. At that time, Bharata's mother, Kaikeyi, came and, with a dignified voice, asked for two boons from King Dasharatha, who was true to his word. Immediately, King Dasharatha granted Bharata the throne as one boon. As the second boon, he granted Rama and Lakshmana, along with Sita, fourteen years of exile. Upon this, Rama and Lakshmana, along with Sita, immediately left for the forest and resided in the ashram of Panchavati in Dandakaranya.

At that time, two Charanmunis were wandering and came there. Rama and Lakshmana respectfully greeted them. The devout Sita offered pure food to both the munis, taking the benefit of feeding guests. At that time, the gods rained fragrant water. Attracted by the fragrance, a vulture king named Jatayu arrived there. Both the Charanmunis gave a sermon there. This also awakened the bird. He remembered his past life. Due to some connection from his previous birth, he always stayed near Sita.

One day, Rama was in the ashram. Lakshmana went out to the forest to bring fruits. There, Lakshmana saw a sword lying on the ground. Out of curiosity, he picked it up and, to test its sharpness, he struck it against a pile of bamboo nearby. After that, he saw the head of a man, cut like a lotus stalk, lying among the bamboo. Seeing this, Lakshmana felt great remorse - "Alas! I have killed this unarmed man without any fight!" Reproaching himself for this deed and feeling self-reproach, Lakshmana went to his elder brother Ramachandra. He narrated the entire incident to him. Hearing this, Ramachandra said, "Brother! This is the sword called Suryahas. You have killed the one who practiced it. There must be someone who will avenge him." Just then, Ravana's sister, Khar's wife, Chandranakha, arrived there where her son was lying dead. Seeing her dead son, she cried out loudly, "Alas! My son Shambuka! Where are you? How did you leave me?" She looked around to find out who had killed her son, but she couldn't see anyone. Then, her eyes fell on the beautiful line of Lakshmana's feet. She thought to herself - 1. There is also a story about a boon in other stories.

Chandranakha's attempt to attract Ravana towards Sita
Yogashastra, Dvitiya Prakash, Sloka 99
'Whether it is true or not, it is certain that the person whose footprints these are has killed my son.' Convinced of this, she followed those footprints. She had not gone far when she saw the captivating Lord Rama seated before Sita and Lakshmana under a tree. Enchanted by the sight of Sri Rama, she became inflamed with desire. 'Even in the height of sorrow, the longing for love in women is quite strange.' She made her appearance extremely charming and pleaded with Rama to engage in amorous play with her. Smiling at her ignoble request, Rama said, 'I have only one wife, you should serve Lakshmana.' So she went to Lakshmana and made a similar plea before him. Lakshmana replied, 'Such a request does not befit a noble lady like you. I cannot possibly accept your proposal.'

Enraged by the rejection and the killing of her son, she went straight to her husband Khara and said, 'Lakshmana has killed my son. He must be avenged.' Incited by his wife's words, Khara, accompanied by fourteen thousand Vidyadharas, charged towards Sri Rama like an elephant. Lakshmana immediately requested Sri Rama, 'Dear elder brother, it is not proper for you to fight them yourself while I am here. Please grant me permission to fight them.' After some thought, Sri Rama said, 'Very well, my child. Since you are so eager, go and achieve victory in the battle. But if you face any serious danger, roar like a lion to call me.'

Thus instructed, Lakshmana went to the battlefield with his bow. In the face-to-face battle, he started felling Khara's soldiers with his sharp arrows, just as Garuda kills serpents. The battle was raging on, with no clear indication of victory or defeat. Meanwhile, Chandranakha went to her brother Ravana to increase the number of soldiers on her husband's side. To incite Ravana, she said, 'Brother, you should know that there are two men named Rama and Lakshmana in the Dandakaranya who have disregarded our clan. They have sent your nephew to the abode of Yama. To avenge this, your brother-in-law has gone to fight Lakshmana with his younger brother's army. The battle is still ongoing. Filled with pride in the valor of your younger brother and your own might, Rama is indulging in amorous play with his wife Sita. Sita's beauty and grace are so captivating that no goddess, nymph or mortal woman can rival her. Her beauty surpasses even the celestial damsels of the three worlds. Her description is beyond words. O king! All the jewels on this earth up to the ocean are under your dominion. Therefore, brother, if you cannot possess this jewel-like woman whose beauty captivates the eyes, what use is Ravana?'

Excited by Chandranakha's words, Ravana immediately boarded the Pushpaka Vimana and commanded, 'O king of the Vimanas! Take me quickly to where Janaki is.' The Vimana flew swiftly to where Janaki was. Seeing the effulgent Rama, Ravana stood at a distance, just as a lion stands away from fire. He thought to himself, 'Conquering Sri Rama and abducting Sita is as difficult as fighting a lion on one side and crossing a river brimming with water on the other.' Ravana invoked the power of Avalokanavidy

Ravana's abduction of Sita and the meeting of Rama with Viradha
We will read the second light of Yoga Shastra, verse 99; because there has been a mutual signal between the two. Therefore, if I do the same, your work will be done. Saying this, the goddess of observation knowledge went some distance from there and made a lion roar like Lakshmana. Hearing it, Rama immediately ran to help Lakshmana, leaving Sita alone there. Great men also fall into irony due to the illusion of the illusionist. As soon as Rama left, Ravana immediately descended from the plane and suddenly caught Sita and said, "I am Ravana, the one who is going to abduct you." Saying this, he forcibly put her in the Pushpak plane and flew away.
Sita was stunned by this unexpected event. Helpless Sita started crying - "Oh Lord! Oh Rama! Oh dear Lakshmana! Oh father! Oh brother with great arms! Your Sita is being abducted in the same way as a crow flies away with a sacrifice in the sky." Sita cried out loud in this way, as if she had made the sky cry. In the meantime, Jatayu bird also flew fast, chasing the plane. Coming near the plane, he said - 'Daughter! Don't be afraid! I have arrived.' Scolding Ravana, he said - 'Oh demon! Where are you taking this holy woman? Stop.' Bhamandal's follower, the Vidhyadhar Ratnajaati, also challenged Ravana and said scornfully - 'Oh thief! Stop! We will take care of you now.' Jatayu bird started hitting Ravana's chest with the sharp claws of his feet. Ravana said to the vulture - 'Old vulture! Are you tired of your life, it seems, your death is near.' Saying this, he cut off his wings with the Chandrahas sword. He writhed in pain, fell down
and his life-wings flew away there. Ravana had taken away the knowledge of that Vidhyadhar, so he also had his wings cut off. Like a bird, he fell face down on the ground. Thus, saving himself, Ravana took Sita to Lanka and kept her in his Ashoka Vatika there. To entice Sita and bring her under his control, he sent the Rakshasi Trijata.
On the other hand, Lakshmana was returning after killing the enemy when he met Rama coming from the front. 'Lakshmana asked - 'Brother! Why did you come here leaving Sita alone?' Rama said - 'I heard the ominous lion roar made by you and immediately ran here.' Lakshmana said - 'Brother! I did not make any lion roar. It seems someone else has deceived us by making a fake lion roar. Undoubtedly, some cunning person has planned this trick to abduct Aryasati.' Rama also said - 'Okay, okay' saying this, he returned to his ashram with Lakshmana. But not seeing Sita there, they felt like a thunderbolt. 'Oh Sita! Where did you go?' Crying like this, Rama fainted and fell to the ground. After a while, when he regained consciousness, Lakshmana said - 'Brother! It is useless to cry when disaster strikes in a helpless state, now we should strive to overcome the disaster. This is the true remedy, at that time a man came and greeted both of them. And on asking, he told his story and said - 'I am the son of Chandrodya, the king of Patala Lanka. Ravana killed my father and made Khar the king in his place. As if, a donkey has been given the place of a horse. At that time, my pregnant mother fled from there and took refuge in a safe place and gave birth to me there. One day, my mother was told by a sage - 'When Khar etc. will be killed by Dasharatha's son Rama, then your son will be made the king by giving him the throne of Patala Lanka. Don't doubt it even for a moment. Therefore, I am searching for you,
I have come here and met you. From today, I am taking your shelter. Consider me a purchased servant in return for killing the enemy of my father. On this, the great-armed Shri Rama took him along to give him the kingdom of Patala Lanka. 'Time-knowing masters are automatically successful by their actions.' Rama was going to give him the throne with Lakshmana. When on the way, a servant of Bhamandal was seen lying unconscious. He was conscious. Therefore, he narrated the whole story of Jatayu, Sita
and Ravana and his own. Rama assured him. After that, with Lakshmana 1. In another story, there is a description of Viradha's arrival and meeting Rama on the battlefield. 2. This description is mentioned in other stories at the time of meeting Sugriva.

The False Sugriva

Yogashastra, Second Canto, Verse 99 | The truthful Rama reached the underworld and installed the said Viradha on his father's throne. Meanwhile, the leader of the Vidyadharas, named Sahasgati, was roaming in the sky near the city of Kishkindha. At that time, the king of Kishkindha, Sugriva, was going out of the city for a stroll with his family. Indeed, such is the state of mind of kings. Just then, Sahasgati reached Sugriva's inner chambers. Seeing Sugriva's wife Tara, he became overwhelmed with desire. Like an elephant suffering from the heat, Sahasgati, tormented by the heat of passion, abandoned the idea of going elsewhere and decided to indulge in amorous play with Tara, as if not to violate the command of Kamadeva. But he thought, "This lady will not readily engage in intimacy with an unfamiliar person." Worried by this concern, he thought, "I am skilled in changing my form like an actor, so why not assume Sugriva's guise?" Thinking thus, Sahasgati took on Sugriva's appearance and entered the palace. The palace guards, mistaking the lustful imposter Sugriva for the real Sugriva, did not prevent him from entering. But before he could reach the palace, the real Sugriva returned and tried to enter, only to be stopped by the guards, who said, "The king has just entered. It seems you are someone else." This led to a heated argument, and the guards summoned the false Sugriva. As soon as he arrived, a tumultuous verbal battle like the roar of the ocean erupted between the two. Seeing the commotion caused by the other Sugriva, Bali's son quickly came to the palace gate to calm the disturbance. Just as a mountain blocks the flow of a river, Bali's son prevented the false Sugriva from entering the inner chambers. The fourteen finest Akshauhini armies of the world gathered there and took their positions. Unable to comprehend the mystery, half the soldiers sided with the false Sugriva, and the other half with the real Sugriva. Thus, the divided army engaged in mutual combat. Spears clashed, and the sparks emanating from the colliding weapons made the sky appear as if it were a meteor shower. Cavalry fought cavalry, elephants fought elephants, infantry fought infantry, and charioteers fought charioteers. Just as a delicate lady trembles from the touch of her beloved, the earth trembled from the clash of the two armies. Seeing no resolution, the true Sugriva challenged the false Sugriva, "You wicked, lustful dog who has intruded into my home! Come, fight with me, and I'll remind you of the sixth day." The artificial Sugriva, maddened by this insult like an intoxicated elephant, came roaring to fight the real Sugriva. Their red eyes blazing with anger, like the siblings of Yama, the two great warriors were tormenting the minds of the impartial spectators. Cutting down the armies on both sides like grass with their sharp weapons, they fought like two buffaloes, causing the celestial beings to flee. Grappling like moving mountains, their weapons were eventually shattered and destroyed. Enraged beyond endurance, they seemed to be flying in the sky one moment and crashing to the ground the next, like two champion roosters. Unable to defeat each other, the two mighty warriors, exhausted, stepped back and stood apart. The artificial Sugriva, now distressed in mind, remained outside Kishkindha, as Bali's son did not allow him to enter the inner chambers at any cost.
The true Sugriva, sitting with his head bowed, began to ponder, "Alas! My lustful enemy is so deceitful that he has subjugated my own people through his machinations. It is regrettable that he has trampled upon his own knees with his deception."

The fake Sugriva and the real Sugriva are at war, the death of courage. The second light of Yoga Shastra, verse 99, has been killed. Now the only worry is how to kill this illusionary and powerful, cruel, and evil enemy? Damn the name of Bali, who shames me and makes me fall from my valor? Blessed is the mighty, unbroken, man-vow keeper Bali, who renounced a kingdom like a straw and attained the supreme state. My son Chandrarashmi, though powerful, is also confused about whom to protect and whom not, because he doesn't know our secret. But Chandrarashmi did a good thing by not letting that evil enter the inner palace. To kill this staunch enemy, who is stronger than me? Because, "The enemy should be killed by any means, either by oneself or by another." Should I seek refuge in the underworld, earth, and heaven, in the mighty Marut or in the Ravana who breaks the yagna, to kill the enemy? No, no, he is naturally a womanizer and a thorn in all the three worlds. If he gets his way, he will kill him and me and take Tara under his control. In such a crisis, there was a strong, courageous, and tough king named Khar, but Ram killed him. So now the only way is to go to the powerful, strong-armed Ram and Lakshman and make friends with them? They had installed Viradha on the throne a few days ago and are still staying in Patal Lanka at Viradha's request. Similarly, Sugriva, in solitude, deeply pondered and sent a trusted messenger to Viradha. He went to Patal Lanka, greeted Viradha, delivered the message given by his master, and finally said, "Our master is in great trouble. He wants to seek refuge in Raghunandan Ram and Lakshman through you." Viradha said, "Bring Sugriva here as soon as possible. Everything will be fine." The meeting of virtuous people is met with great merit. The messenger came and told Sugriva everything. Sugriva also mounted his excellent horse and set out, his horse's neigh echoing in all directions, reducing the distance with the speed of a messenger. He reached Patal Lanka quickly, like a neighbor's house. There he first met Viradha. Viradha also embraced him lovingly and introduced him to the selfless protector, Shri Ram. Sugriva greeted them and narrated his entire tale of woe. Finally, he said, "In this time of crisis, you are my only refuge. When a sneeze stops, only the sun is sought refuge in." Even though he was in trouble himself, Shri Ram was ready to solve his problem. Great men are more eager to do the work of others than to accomplish their own. Viradha told Sugriva the story of Sita's abduction. Sugriva folded his hands and humbly requested Shri Ram, "Just as the sun illuminates the whole world, you are capable of protecting everyone. You don't need anyone's help. Still, O God! I pray to you that with your grace, I will become your follower with my army to kill the enemy and bring news of Sita as soon as possible." With Sugriva, Shri Ram set out towards Kishkindha. Viradha also wanted to come along, but Shri Ram persuaded him to return. Shri Ram continued with Sugriva. They set up their army camp near Kishkindha Nagar and challenged the fake Sugriva to battle. The deceitful Sugriva also roared and thundered and arrived there. The proverb says, "Brahmins do not become lazy when invited to a meal, similarly, warriors do not become lazy when invited to battle." There, fighting like a mad elephant in the jungle, both Sugrivas began to shake the earth with their feet. Because their appearances were identical, Shri Ram was in doubt, "Which one is my Sugriva and which one is the fake Sugriva?" He was momentarily sad and thought, "What is going to happen, will happen." In the next moment, he sounded the bow named Vajravarta. As soon as he heard that sound, the art of transformation of courage went away. Now, coming back to his real form, Shri Ram challenged courage, "Evil! You want to enjoy another man's wife by deceiving everyone with your changed form, sinner! Prepare your bow." Saying this, Shri Ram ended his life with a single arrow. Because a lion does not need another paw to kill a deer. Now, Shri Ram installed Sugriva on the throne of Kishkindha Nagar, just like Viradha. King Sugriva also became acceptable to the people as before.

Hanuman's meeting with Sita, entering Lanka for war
_ Yogashastra Second Light Verse 99 Here Viradha also came with an army for Rama's work. It is true that a grateful person cannot live happily without doing the work of his master. Bhamandala also arrived there with an army of Vidyadharas. A noble person considers the work of the master to be greater than a festival. Sugriva sent word to all sides, calling his famous and powerful vassal kings, Jambavan, Nal, Neel, etc. Here, when the armies of other Vidyadhara kings also gathered there from all sides, Sugriva saluted Shri Rama and respectfully requested, 'Dev! This is Hanuman, the son of Anjanadevi and Pavananjay, who is extremely powerful and devoted to service. He will go to Lanka to get news of Sita ji at your command. Bless him and give him your named seal for identification.' Shri Rama explained everything to Hanuman in brief and blessed him by giving him his signet ring. The son of the wind, Hanuman, also set off on his way through the sky with great speed, like the wind. In a short time he reached Lanka. In Lanka, he saw Sita meditating on Rama like a mantra, under the Shinshapa tree in Ravana's garden. Hanuman became invisible in the branch of the tree and from above he put the signet ring in Sita's lap for identification. Seeing the signet ring inscribed with Rama's name, Sita was overjoyed. Seeing this, the Rakshasi Trijata went to Ravana and requested, 'Dev! For so long we have seen Sita distressed, but today she is in a mood of happiness.' Ravana thought, 'Surely Sita has now forgotten Rama and is happy with the desire to make love with me.' He called Mandodari and ordered, 'Devi! You go and explain to Sita. This is a good opportunity now.' To carry out her husband's diplomatic mission, Mandodari reached Sita. Trying to win over Sita with allurements, she spoke to her in a humble manner, 'Look, Sita! Ravana is a very great king, adorned with many qualities like unparalleled wealth, beauty, etc. Ravana's wealth, etc., is also suitable for you. It is unfortunate that the unknown fate did not bring you two together. But now that time has come. Therefore, go to Ravana, who is constantly absorbed in your thoughts. Serve him and spend your life in pleasure. O beautiful one! All the other queens will obey your orders.' Hearing this, Sita scornfully said to Mandodari, 'O wicked woman, who carries out the diplomatic mission of her husband! O evil-faced one! Are you not ashamed to say such things! Your face is not worth seeing, just like your husband's. Understand that I am with Rama. Because Lakshmana has come here. He will kill your husband along with his brothers like Khar, etc. O wicked woman! Get up from here. Don't talk to me anymore.' Thus humiliated, Mandodari left from there in anger.
After Mandodari left, Hanuman descended from the tree and respectfully saluted Sita, folded his hands and said, 'Devi! Shri Rama, along with Lakshmana, are well and victorious by your good fortune. I have come here at the command of Shri Rama to get news of you. I will return and tell them your news. Then Shri Rama will come here to destroy the enemy. Seeing Hanuman, the messenger of her husband and the bearer of his symbol, Sita was overjoyed. She congratulated Hanuman with her infallible blessings. After that, at Hanuman's request and happy to receive news of Shri Rama, Sita broke her fast of 19 days. ' The son of the wind, Hanuman, who was as spirited as the wind, to show the wonder of his strength, broke and destroyed the trees, leaves, fruits, branches, etc. of the garden, destroying Ravana's garden. Seeing the garden being destroyed, the gardeners wanted to catch Hanuman and punish him, but he was not in anyone's grasp. Finally, the gardeners went to Ravana and complained. Ravana ordered to catch Hanuman and if he could not be caught, then to kill him. The gardeners came to the garden with some of Ravana's soldiers, but Hanuman alone killed them all and drove them away. Truly, 'The speed of victory in battle is strange.' Ravana ordered Shakrajit to bring Hanuman bound. He threw the weapon of Pashabhandan. Hanuman was bound in it by himself. Shakrajit took Hanuman bound to Ravana, but what was this? Hanuman immediately broke the Pashabhandan and raised his foot like a thunderbolt and shattered Ravana's crown. 1. In the seventh chapter of Trishatti, there is a mention of breaking the fast of 21 days. And there is a mention of Sita giving the crown (crown).

The use of Amogh Shakti, Lakshman fainted.
Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 99
| Ravana, terrified, shouted loudly, "Hey! Is anyone there? Catch him, kill this scoundrel." Hanuman immediately leaped from there and in a short time, he roamed the entire city, destroying it; making it like an orphan. With his foot | he broke many buildings of the city like breaking a drum. Thus, playing, Hanuman flew like Garuda | and reached Shri Ram. After saluting, Hanuman narrated the entire incident from beginning to end. Ram embraced his beloved servant dearly. Then he ordered Sugriva and others to go to Lanka for the victory march. By building a bridge (bridge) over the sea that protected Ravana, Shri Ram's army crossed the sea. Shri Ram, along with Sugriva and others, boarded the plane | and reached Lanka. There, they camped in Hansadweep and the army surrounded the city of Lanka like a small path.
Vibhishan reached Ravana's court, saluted and requested Ravana, "Elder brother! Although I am younger than you. It is not appropriate for me to say anything to you; however, seeing something spread in the city, I have been compelled to say something as a well-wisher. I hope you will definitely accept my words. Shri Ram has come to our city, and | they are only asking you to return their Sita. You consider this with a long view and in my humble opinion, you should hand over Sita to them with respect, so that there is no loss of Dharma, and there is no ill-repute in the world." As soon as Ravana heard this | he said angrily, "Oh Vibhishan! It seems you are afraid of him; that's why you are giving me advice like a coward!" Then Vibhishan said, "Elder brother! Let alone Ram and Lakshman, what did their mere soldier | Hanuman not do? Didn't you see-hear?" Ravana said, "You seem to be siding with our enemy, that's why you are talking such nonsense. You are a good-for-nothing, get out of here." Thus, after humiliating | Vibhishan was expelled. Therefore, Vibhishan went to Shri Ram. Shri Ram promised him the kingdom of Lanka. Because 'great men never hesitate to accept righteousness.' Bronze tal meets bronze tal, | similarly, coming out of Lanka, Shri Ram's and Ravana's armies openly clashed with each other. Victory Lakshmi, like the Lakshmi of both the moneylender and the debtor, sometimes here and sometimes there, both the armies that were about to be consumed by fire | started coming and going. Later, on receiving orders from Ram's Bhru-sanjna, one after the other, Hanuman and other warriors, in the same way | they started diving into the enemy army in the same way as the gods dived into the ocean during the churning of the ocean.
On the other hand, Ram's valiant and invincible warriors, spreading like ferocious elephants, killed many demons; many were captured and imprisoned, many soldiers were driven away. Hearing this bad news, enraged like a burning ember, Kumbhakarna and the arrogant Meghnad entered the battlefield.
Both the warriors jumped into the battle like a cataclysmic storm and fire. It was unbearable for Ram's army. | Sugriva, in anger, picked up a mountain like a rock and threw it at Kumbhakarna; Kumbhakarna also smashed him to pieces with his mace. Then, with the blow of the mace, he threw Sugriva down and pressed him in his armpit and took him to Lanka | went. Seeing this, Meghnad, who roared like a cloud, was also delighted. And with a sharp shower of arrows, he wounded the army of Vanardweep. Shri Ram, with red eyes, challenged Kumbhakarna and Lakshman challenged Meghnad, "Stop, stop | now we will make you taste the fun." Sugriva also immediately jumped there in enthusiasm. 'How long can mercury be kept in the fist?' Therefore, Kumbhakarna returned from there and clashed with Ram. On the other hand, Meghnad, who disturbed the world, also quickly clashed with Lakshman. Ram and Kumbhakarna were playing the tricks of war like the east and west seas, on the other hand, Ravana's son Meghnad and Lakshman were also playing their own tricks. | started. In a short time, to control the demons, Shri Ram, the demon, fought Kumbhakarna, the younger brother of Ravana, and Lakshman 1. In another story, Hanuman is described as being pressed into the armpit.

## The Battle of Rama and Ravana

The second light of Yoga Shastra, verse 99, describes how Ravana's son, Meghnad, was captured after being knocked down. Seeing this, Ravana, as vast as Airavata and terrifying to the world, came to the battlefield, gnashing his teeth in rage, ready to crush the entire monkey army like elephants. At that moment, Lakshmana said to Shri Rama, "Lord! You need not go to the battlefield now. I alone will deal with them all." Thus, stopping Rama, Lakshmana himself, showering arrows, came before the enemy. Ravana, proficient in the art of weaponry, unleashed countless weapons, which Lakshmana cut down one by one. Finally, Ravana struck Lakshmana's chest with a powerful weapon called Amoghshakti. From the impact of this weapon, Lakshmana fell unconscious on the ground. Grief filled the heart of the powerful Rama. Eight valiant warriors, including the devoted Sugriva, surrounded Rama and Lakshmana for protection. Ravana, overjoyed, thought, "Today Lakshmana will die. Rama will also suffer the same fate in Lakshmana's absence. What is the point of fighting now?" Thinking this, he turned towards the city. Rama was surrounded by many soldiers for protection, like a fort. Sugriva and others stood at the four gates of Rama's residence. At that time, a leader of the Vidyadharas, an old acquaintance of Bhamandal, the guardian of the south gate, came and said, "There is a city called Kautukamangal, twelve yojanas from Ayodhya. The king of that city, Dronadhan, is the brother of Kaikeyi. He has a daughter named Vishalya. The touch of her bathwater instantly removes the poison of an arrow. If that water is sprinkled on Lakshmana before sunrise, he will be free of the poison and live. Otherwise, it will be difficult for him to survive. Therefore, in my opinion, you should immediately request Shri Rama to send someone trustworthy to bring her. Act quickly in this matter. Once the morning arrives, no remedy will work. What can Ganesha do when the cart has overturned?"

Bhamandal immediately went to Shri Rama and explained everything. Therefore, Hanuman and Bhamandal, both swift as a storm, boarded a fast-flying aircraft and arrived in Ayodhya. At that time, Bharata was asleep in his palace, so both of them sang sweet songs to wake him up. "Kings are also awakened with sweet songs for matters of state." Bharata, abandoning sleep and stretching, woke up and saw Bhamandal, whom he greeted. He asked the reason for their arrival, and Bhamandal mentioned the important task. One does not speak too much to a dear friend about a dear task. Bharata thought, "This task can only be accomplished if I go myself." So, boarding the aircraft, he immediately arrived in Kautukamangal. He requested Vishalya from King Dronadhan for Lakshmana. The king accepted the request, called Vishalya, and gave her to Bharata along with a thousand other girls. Bhamandal also left Bharata in Ayodhya and, with Vishalya and her family, anxiously arrived at the battlefield. In that aircraft, shining like a bright lamp, Bhamandal was repeatedly mistaken about the sunrise, which filled him with fear. As soon as he disembarked from the aircraft, Bhamandal took Vishalya directly to Lakshmana. As soon as he touched Lakshmana's hand, the poison of the arrow, like a serpent, left him. After that, by Rama's command, Vishalya's bathwater was sprinkled on the other soldiers, who, free of the poison, rose like they had been reborn. Then, Shri Rama loudly commanded that Vishalya's bathwater be sprinkled on Kumbhakarna and others. But the guards said, "Lord! They themselves took initiation at that time." Hearing this, Rama said, "Then they are travelers on the path of liberation, worthy of respect. They should be freed from their bonds." By Rama's command, the guards, after bowing, immediately freed them. After this, Vishalya and all the girls who came with her were formally married to Lakshmana.

When Ravana, the embodiment of anger, received this news, he rushed back to the battlefield. For valiant warriors, the festival of war is even greater than the festival of marriage. Whenever Ravana unleashed a weapon, Lakshmana cut it down like a banana leaf. Enraged by the destruction of his weapons, Ravana threw his discus. The discus struck Lakshmana's chest like a slap, but its edge did not cut him, not even a hair on his head was disturbed. Lakshmana returned the same discus to Ravana. 1. In another story, it is mentioned that Ravana took initiation after his death.

## The Death of Ravana, the Story of Sudarshan

**Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verses 100 & 101**

The story of Ravana's death, the story of Sudarshan. 

Ravana's head was severed by the Sudarshan Chakra, which was hurled by Lord Rama.  After Ravana's demise, Lord Rama, with a heart as pure as gold, met Sita and brought her back to his abode. Vibhishana was crowned the king of Lanka.  Lord Rama, Lakshmana, Sita, their wives, and all their friends and family returned to Ayodhya. Ravana, due to his desire for another man's wife, was destroyed and became a resident of hell. 

This is the story of Ravana in brief. This is the essence of the Sita-Ravana story. This example teaches us to renounce another man's wife. This is what the next verse says:

**Verse 100**

**Meaning:** Even if a woman is beautiful, has auspicious limbs, is a house of beauty and wealth, and is skilled in various arts, one should renounce her.

**Explanation:**  Why is another man's wife called "Dustyaja" (one who should not be abandoned)? This verse explains it. Many women are so desirable due to their beauty and form. Many are beautiful and well-proportioned due to their past good deeds. They are superior in beauty and wealth. They are proficient in the 64 arts befitting women. Due to these reasons, a man does not want to abandon them out of infatuation. Therefore, another man's wife is called "Dustyaja". Therefore, even if another man's wife is beautiful, skilled in the arts, clever, and adorned with virtues, she is still another man's, and therefore should be renounced.

**Verse 101**

**Meaning:**  Even in the presence of another man's wife, Sudarshan, the great Shravaka, with his pure mind, whose auspicious sight elevates life, or who elevates Jain Dharma, how much praise can we give him?

**Explanation:**  Even when in the presence of another man's wife, and even if he has the power or the qualities to enjoy her, the mind of Sudarshan, the great Shravaka, remained pure. His mind was not stained in the least. How much praise can we give to such a Shravaka, who elevates the Dharma? No matter how much we praise him, it will never be enough.

**The Life of Sudarshan, the Great Shravaka, Strong in his Conduct:**

In ancient times, in the Anga country, there was a city called Champapuri, which was even greater than Alkapuri. In this city, King Dadhivahana ruled, who was richer than Kubera. He had a queen named Abhaya, who was beautiful enough to surpass even the celestial nymphs, and was skilled in the arts. In the same city, there lived a merchant named Rishabhadas, who was the leader of all the merchants and was dedicated to noble deeds. He had a wife named Arhadasi, who was virtuous, a follower of Jain Dharma, and had qualities matching her name. They had a servant named Subhag, who looked after their cows and buffaloes. He would take the animals to the forest to graze and bring them back in the evening. 

One day, it was the month of Magha. As he was returning from the forest with the animals in the evening, he saw a naked monk meditating under a tree. He was surprised. "In such a cold night, he is meditating, naked, standing still like a stump. Truly, these great souls are blessed!" He thought this and went home. That night, the kind-hearted boy continued to think about the great monk. "Here I am, sleeping with so many clothes on, and there he is, the great soul, completely naked in this snowfall. He doesn't even care about the cold." The next morning, he went to the same place where the monk was meditating, taking the animals with him, as he had thought about it all night. With devotion, he bowed to the monk and sat down to serve him. "Simple, kind-hearted people have natural wisdom." 

Soon, the sun rose in the east, as if it had come to see such great monks with reverence. As the monk opened his eyes from meditation, he uttered the words "Namo Arihantaanam".

The Story of Sudarshan
Chapter Two of Yoga Shastra, Verse 101

He uttered the words and flew up into the sky like the sun. Hearing this, Subhag thought, "This is surely the knowledge of the celestial beings." With this thought, he held the first part of the salutation mantra in his heart. Therefore, whether sleeping, waking, rising, sitting, walking, moving, day or night, at home or outside, even with soiled clothes, body, or unclean hands, he began to utter the words "Namo Arihantanam." It is true that by focusing on something, one becomes absorbed in it. One day, the Seth heard these words from his mouth and asked, "Bhadral, where did you get this one part of the five-great-ones mantra, which is so powerful and excellent in the world?" Subhag told him everything. "Very good!" said the Seth, explaining to him, "This is not only celestial knowledge, but it also leads to heaven and liberation (moksha). Whatever is the best, beautiful, or rare in the three worlds, all of it is obtained effortlessly through its influence. Just as one cannot measure the quantity of seawater, so too, one cannot measure the glory of the five-great-ones salutation mantra. You are very fortunate to have obtained such a rare mantra through your virtuous karma. But when your clothes or body are dirty, or your mouth and hands are unclean, you should never utter this guru mantra." To this, Subhag said to the Seth, "Just as an addict cannot give up his addiction, so too, I cannot give up this mantra." The Seth said with pleasure, "Good, my son! You learn this entire salutation mantra, so that you may be blessed in this world and the next." Therefore, Subhag learned the entire salutation mantra. As if he had found a wonderful treasure, he began to constantly remember (chant) that mantra with great devotion. Through the influence of this mantra, the animal herder Subhag no longer felt any pain from hunger or thirst. In this way, he became addicted to the five-great-ones mantra. It became a part of his life, that great mantra.

Thus, a considerable amount of time passed. Once, during the rainy season, the sky was continuously covered with dark clouds. Subhag went out from home with his animals to graze in the forest. While returning, there was such a torrential downpour, as if a series of arrows of water had bound the sky and the earth. While returning home, Subhag had to cross a small river, which was also flooded today. Seeing the overflowing river, full of water, Subhag stopped for a while on this bank and thought. His animals had crossed the river and reached the other side. With firm faith, Subhag chanted the great mantra Navkar, considering it celestial knowledge, and tried to jump and fly up, but he fell into the river. Due to the sudden fall, where he stopped in the mud, there was a sharp stake of wood, as strong as Yama's teeth, which pierced his stomach. He felt unbearable pain from the piercing of the stake, yet he continued to chant the five-great-ones mantra. The stake had pierced his vital spot like a sharp nail, and so he died immediately. Upon dying, he was immediately born in the womb of the Seth's wife, Arhdasi. It is certain that those who are absorbed in the salutation mantra attain a good destiny. After three months, the Seth's wife gave birth to a son. She told her husband, "I have a desire to be bathed with fragrant water, anointed, and worshipped with flowers in front of the statue of Jinendra. I also have a desire to donate clothes and other things to the monks, to worship the holy community, and to give charity to the poor and suffering." Hearing this, the Seth was very happy and fulfilled his wife's desires as if they were a wish-fulfilling gem. After that, when nine months and seven and a half days were completed, the Seth's wife gave birth to a healthy and beautiful son with auspicious signs. The Seth celebrated the birth of his son with great joy, seeing the auspicious day, and named him Sudarshan, which is truly befitting his qualities. With the best wishes of his parents, Sudarshan gradually grew up. When he reached the appropriate age, he learned all the arts. When he became an adult, the Seth married him to a beautiful girl named Manorama, who was as beautiful as Lakshmi herself. Sudarshan's gentle appearance pleased not only his parents, but also the king and all the other people, as it was as delightful and pleasing as the moon.

In the same city, there lived a royal priest named Kapil, who was a scholar of the ocean of knowledge. He also held a prominent place in the king's heart. Just as there is an inseparable friendship between Kamadeva and the spring season, so too, there was a permanent and inseparable friendship between Kapil and Sudarshan.

Steadfast in virtue, Sudarshan was not caught in the web of Kapila's deceit.

In the second light of Yoga Shastra, verse 101, friendship had blossomed. Just as Mercury does not leave the company of the Sun, so too did Kapil rarely leave the company of the magnanimous Sudarshan. One day, Kapila, the priest's wife, asked her husband, "My lord! Where do you spend so much time, ignoring all the tasks that need to be done?" The priest replied, "I mostly stay with Sudarshan." Kapila inquired about Sudarshan's identity, and the priest answered, "My dear! Do you not know my friend Sudarshan, who is the foremost among gentlemen, unique in the world, handsome, pleasing to behold?" Come, I will introduce you to him. Sudarshan is the intelligent son of Rishabhdas Seth, he is like Kamadeva in form, the moon in radiance, the sun in brilliance, the ocean in gravity, Uttaramuni in forgiveness, and like the Chintamani jewel in generosity; he is the Mount Rohana of gems of virtue, he is so sweet-tongued, as if he were a pool of nectar, he is like the adornment of the earth's face. Who is capable of describing all his virtues? He is the jewel of virtue, never deviating from his character."

Hearing the praise of Sudarshan from her husband's mouth, a fire of desire ignited in Kapila's heart; she became mentally attached to his form. Brahmin women are often fickle. Just as a yogini practices day and night to attain union with the Supreme Brahman, so too did Kapila practice day and night to achieve union with Sudarshan, devising schemes.

One day, by the king's order, Kapil had gone to another village. Seeing this as a good opportunity, Kapila went to Sudarshan and said, "Your friend is very ill today, so he couldn't come to see you. He is not only physically unwell, but he is also restless in your separation, unable to bear not seeing you. That is why your friend sent me to call you. I didn't even know about this." Saying this, the simple-hearted Sudarshan immediately went to the priest's house. Gentle people are naturally trusting, so they do not suspect deceit in others. As soon as Sudarshan entered the house, he asked, "Where is my friend Kapil?" Kapila said, "Come on, your friend is sleeping in the inner room." Walking a little further, Sudarshan asked again, "Kapil is not here, where did he go?" "He is sleeping in the empty space due to his illness. Therefore, go inside the bedroom and meet him." When Kapil was not found in the bedroom, the simple-minded Sudarshan said, "My dear! Tell me, where is my friend Kapil?" Kapila immediately closed the door of the bedroom, seated Sudarshan on the bed, and began to uncover her beautiful limbs, covering them with fine garments. The fickle-eyed Kapila, excited, began to untie the knot of her lower garment, making gestures and glances, laughing and smiling, she said, "Kapil is not here, so take care of Kapila. Why do you differentiate between Kapil and Kapila?" Sudarshan asked, "What should I take care of Kapila for?" Kapila said, "My dear! Ever since I heard the praise of your wonderful form and virtues, this fever has been tormenting me. Just as the arrival of clouds is cooling for the earth scorched by the heat of summer, so too will your union be cooling for me, who is tormented by the heat of separation. My fate has opened today, that you have arrived through deceit. Therefore, accept me. I am yours, I am dedicating my heart to you. From time immemorial, I have been tormented by lust, please console me with the nectar of your embrace."

Hearing this unexpected request for love, Sudarshan was stunned. He thought to himself, "Damn this shameless woman! This strange trick of hers is as invincible as fate." The quick-witted Sudarshan said aloud, "My dear! Your request might be appropriate for a young man, but I am impotent. You have been deceived by my male attire." Hearing this, Kapila's lust subsided. Regretting in her heart, she immediately opened the door and said, "Okay, okay, then you are not for me, go." Sudarshan also left quickly, thinking, "Good thing I got out of this hellhole quickly." He then went straight to his home. Sudarshan was lost in deep thought, "Truly, such women are more terrible than demons in their art of deceit, like Sakinis in their tricks, and they surpass lightning in their fickleness. I fear that such a cunning, deceitful, fickle, and lying woman might...

Abhayarani's Decision to Entrap Sudarshana in the Snare of Passion

Yogashastra, Second Illumination, Verse 101: "He should not sit idle and indulge in unnecessary activities." Therefore, I make this resolve that "from today, I will never go alone to anyone's house." Thereafter, the embodiment of virtuous conduct, Sudarshana, engaged in auspicious religious activities and began to live his life happily. He was constantly mindful that no wrong conduct should occur in his life.

One day, the grand Indra festival, a source of joy for the worthy citizens and the entire world, was taking place in the city. Radiant like the autumnal moon and Agastya, Sudarshana and the priest Kapila reached the royal garden together. Meanwhile, Abhayarani, seated like a goddess in a palanquin, was also going to the garden with Kapila. At that very moment, Manorama, the wife of Sudarshana, who was the embodiment of chaste virtue, was also going to the garden in a chariot with her six sons. Seeing her, Kapila asked Abhayarani, "O mistress! Who is this beautiful woman, like a divine damsel, seated in the chariot and going ahead?" Abhayarani said, "Learned one! Don't you know? She is the virtuous wife of Sudarshana, the very embodiment of the household goddess." Astonished, Kapila said, "She is the wife of Sudarshana? Then her skill is truly amazing!" The queen said, "In what skill do you consider her amazing?" Boldly, Kapila said, "She has performed an amazing feat by giving birth to so many sons." Abhayarani said, "If the husband and wife have mutual, exclusive love for each other, then for a woman to give birth to so many sons is no feat. Irritated, Kapila said, "Yes, it is true that if the husband is a man, then it is possible. But Sudarshana, in the guise of a man, is a eunuch." "How do you know that he is a eunuch?" Abhayarani asked. Thereupon, Kapila narrated her own experience with Sudarshana. Abhaya said, "Innocent Kapila! If that is the case, then you have been cheated! He is a eunuch for other women, but not for his own wife." Kapila was embarrassed and, out of jealousy, said tauntingly, "I was a fool and innocent, so I was cheated. You are the most cunning of all. I will only consider you superior when you bring him under your control." Abhaya said, "Even hard stones melt with love and generous gifts; then what is the challenge for me with this living being? Before me?" Irritated, Kapila said, "Don't boast in vain, O Queen! If you are so proud of your skill, then demonstrate it by engaging in sexual play with Sudarshana." The arrogant queen said, "Kapila! Just know that I have already enjoyed intimacy with Sudarshana. If a woman is clever, then even the most austere forest-dwelling ascetics come under her control. Then what chance does this tender-hearted householder have? Bringing him under my control is a mere child's play for me. If I do not engage in intimacy with him after bringing him under my control, then I will enter the fire." Thus, the two continued their boastful conversation and reached the garden. There, they began to play freely, as if the celestial nymphs were frolicking in Nandana forest. Exhausted from the play, they went to their respective places.

Abhayarani shared her vow with the wise, learned, and skilled in statecraft, the nurse-mother named Sarvajna, Pandita, and Kutaniti Nipuna. Hearing this, she said, "Oh daughter! Your vow is not appropriate. You are still unaware of the fortitude of great souls. Sudarshana's mind is firmly established in the service and devotion to the Jinas and the great ascetics. Fie on your futile vow! Even an ordinary layman considers a woman other than his wife as his sister. Then what to say about this great being, whose gurus are the ascetics devoted to brahmacharya (celibacy) and other great vows? How can he, who always lives in the guru's abode, constantly engaged in meditation and silence, be brought under your control? It is good to make a vow to seize the jewel on the head of a snake, but it is never good to make a vow to destroy the virtue of such a steadfast person." Thereupon, Abhaya said to the nurse-mother, "Mother! Somehow or the other, you just have to bring him here. I will take care of whatever needs to be done after that. You don't have to use any deceit; just bring him here by some means." The Pandita, after a moment's thought, said, "Daughter! If this is your determination, then there is only one way to bring him here; on the day of the festival, Sudarshana remains steadfast in dharmaddhyana (contemplation of the Dharma) in some empty house. In that state, he can be brought here. Apart from this, it is impossible to bring him here."

The queen, pleased, said, "This is exactly what I wanted."

Abhaya's Efforts to Bring Sudarshana

The appropriate means is the verse 101 of the second chapter of the Yogashastra, yours! Just start making this effort from today.' The foster mother also agreed to make efforts according to the means she had told. After a few days, the joyous Kaumudi festival came. The king, eager to celebrate the festival with great pomp, ordered his palace guards to announce in the city that it is the royal command that all the men and women of the city should come to the garden dressed up to see the Kaumudi festival.

When Sudarshana heard this royal command, he started thinking with regret - 'After performing the morning Chaitya-vandana, my mind is eager to spend the whole day and night in Paushadha, but the king's strong command is to participate in the festival. So what should I do? Whatever is going to happen, will happen.'

Thinking this, Sudarshana went straight to the king. After offering respects, he requested the king - 'O king! Tomorrow is the festival day. With your grace, I will perform Chaitya-vandana and observe Paushadha. Therefore, please grant me permission not to participate in the festival.' The king accepted his request.

The next day, Sudarshana, after completing the Chaitya-vandana at the right time, accepted Paushadha and stood in Kayotsarga meditation in some corner of the city. When the foster mother came to know this through reliable sources, she happily went to Abhayarani and said - 'Dear! Today is a good opportunity, perhaps your desire will be fulfilled. But today, do not go to the garden for the Kaumudi festival. Today I have a severe headache,' and making this excuse, she stayed in the inner palace.

The Pandita covered the beautiful idol of Kamadeva with a cloth and placed it on the chariot, and taking it, entered the royal palace. When the guard asked, 'What is this?', the Pandita, the mine of deceit, stopped the chariot and replied - 'Since the queen's health is not good today, she cannot go to the garden, so she will worship the idols of Kamadeva and other deities in the palace itself, so we are taking this idol of Kamadeva to the palace.'

In this way, the Pandita made the idols enter the palace three more times. The truth is, how much cunning and skill a woman has! The fourth time, instead of the idol, Sudarshana was seated in the chariot and covered with a cloth so skillfully that the onlooker would think it was the idol itself. This time, without informing the guard, the Pandita took the chariot straight to the courtyard of the royal palace and quickly took Sudarshana down from the chariot and took him to the queen's special room and handed him over. Seeing Sudarshana after removing the cloth, the fearless queen, filled with passion, started trying to disturb him by displaying gestures and amorous movements. Shamelessly showing her breasts and other limbs, the queen said with a sidelong glance - 'Lord! The sharp arrows of Kamadeva have wounded me. Since you are like Kamadeva himself, I have come to your refuge to find peace from him. O Refuge! Lord! Save me, the one tormented by desire.' Great souls engage even in improper acts for the sake of helping others. You should not be angry at all on the Pandita who has brought you here through deceit.'

Hearing this, Sudarshana, immersed in high spiritual thoughts, remained motionless in Kayotsarga like a divine statue. Abhaya pleaded again, 'Lord! Please say something! I have been calling you with charming gestures for so long and you are just standing completely silent and motionless. Why are you ignoring me? Why have you taken this vow with so much difficulty? Leave it! By attaining me, the fruit of your vow has been obtained, your task has been accomplished, understand. O Honored One! Accept this servant who is begging you with humility. Why don't you accept the jewel that has fallen into your lap by divine arrangement? How long will you continue this drama of pride in your good fortune? Saying this, Abhaya made Sudarshana's hands touch her full, raised breasts, and embraced him tightly with her soft lotus-like hands. Seeing such temptations suitable for breaking the vow of celibacy, the naturally calm Sudarshana remained motionless in his Kayotsarga. Sudarshana mentally resolved - 'I will complete the Kayotsarga and do Parana only after getting rid of this temptation, otherwise I will not be able to complete it.'

Abhaya's Order for Execution by Accusation of Fault
Yogashastra, Second Illumination, Verse 101
I will continue my fast. Seeing Sudarshana standing silent and motionless, the cunning-hearted Abhaya, becoming fearless, frowned and said - "O shameless! Fool! Soulless one! Do you dare to insult me, the respectable one? Remember, women are capable of punishing or rewarding men. Don't you know this? Even after my passionate pleas under the influence of Kamadeva, if you do not come under my control, then without a doubt, I will make you a guest of Yama (the god of death) in no time." As Abhaya became more and more agitated and fierce, the magnanimous Sudarshana became more and more absorbed in the realm of spiritual contemplation. The entire night passed in this manner. Despite being repeatedly astonished, Sudarshana did not waver even a bit from his meditation. Just as the great ocean cannot be disturbed by the beating of a boat's oar, Sudarshana remained unmoved.

Seeing the dawn, Abhaya tore her clothes and started screaming loudly, "Run, run! Save me, this wicked one wants to rape me." Hearing the commotion, the guards rushed to the palace. They saw Sudarshana standing motionless in kayotsarga (a Jain meditation posture). The guards thought, "This is unbelievable. How can this be possible?" They went straight to the king and reported the entire incident. The king came to Abhaya and, seeing her distraught, she said through tears, "O king! I had stayed here on your order. Suddenly, this demon-like person entered my palace and, seeing me, became lustful like a hungry wolf. First, this sinful, lascivious man pleaded with me in sweet words to engage in carnal relations. I told him, 'A chaste woman can never behave like an unchaste one. Can black pepper be chewed like chickpeas?' When I did not submit to him, he tried to rape me, and left me in this terrible state!" Hearing this, the king could not believe that Sudarshana could do such a thing. The king repeatedly asked Sudarshana about the truth of the matter, but the compassionate Sudarshana, out of mercy for the queen, did not respond. Just as sandalwood, even when heavily rubbed, cools the heat of others, Sudarshana remained completely silent. Considering his silence as a sign of being an adulterer, the enraged king ordered his arrest and had his crime announced throughout the city, that Sudarshana is a heinous sinner, and the king has ordered his execution.

The king's command is fulfilled by his words, and the gods' by their minds. As soon as the royal order was given, the king's men seized Sudarshana and made him sit on a donkey. They blackened his face with ink, applied red sandalwood paste on his body, placed a garland of coral flowers on his head, and a necklace of kankola fruits around his neck. Then, beating drums, they paraded Sudarshana through the city, making announcements at crossroads that this sinner had committed a terrible crime in the king's inner chambers, and therefore, he is being executed. The people were shocked to hear this, thinking, "This is simply unbelievable! It seems there is some conspiracy here." But in the face of the king's order, they were helpless. There was an uproar among the people. 

When Sudarshana was brought in front of his own house, his chaste wife Manorama was stunned to see the spectacle. She thought, "My husband is a man of virtue, I have seen this many times. The king also loved his conduct. But this dreadful sight makes it seem that fate (destiny) is adverse. Surely, he is reaping the fruits of some inauspicious deeds from a past life. Now, except for praying to the Lord, there is no other remedy." Resolving this in her mind, she went into kayotsarga and became absorbed in devotion to the Jina deities. Finally, she pleaded with the presiding goddess, "Goddess! There is no possibility of any moral flaw in my husband. Therefore, please assist this supreme spiritual aspirant; only then will I complete my fast, otherwise I will continue fasting in this very state."

The Throne of Spikes, Initiation
Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 101

"How can noble women live through the loss of dharma and the calamity that befalls their husbands?" In response to this, the king's guards took Sudarshan to the place of execution and placed him on the spikes. For servants, the king's orders are terrible and inviolable. But in the blink of an eye, the spikes were replaced by a golden lotus throne! Even Yama, the god of death, is humbled in the face of divine power. Still, the king's men, determined to execute Sudarshan, struck him with a sharp sword. But as the sword touched his neck, it transformed into a garland of flowers. Seeing this miraculous event, the king's men rushed to inform the king. Upon hearing the entire story, the king immediately mounted his elephant and arrived at the scene. Seeing Sudarshan, the king embraced him and said with remorse, "I am deeply ashamed that I, a sinner, falsely accused you and defamed you. 'Shreshthi! Your merit was so powerful that even a hair could not be harmed. By doing this, I have greatly wronged you. But you have upheld your righteous dharma. Forgive me.' Trusting a deceitful woman, I ordered your execution; therefore, there is no sinner in the world except this Dadhivahan. Another reason for this terrible sin committed by me is that 'I repeatedly asked you about this, but you did not answer at all. Tell me, what else can I, a simpleton, decide on this?' Whatever it may be, get on the elephant." The king placed Sudarshan on the elephant and, while conversing, took him to his palace. He had him bathed, adorned with clothes and ornaments, and then, taking him aside, requested him to recount the events of the night in detail. Seth Sudarshan narrated the entire incident truthfully. Upon hearing this, the king was enraged at the queen and was ready to punish her. Sudarshan immediately fell at the king's feet and begged him not to do so. The king then pardoned the queen. Afterwards, the righteous king, placing Seth Sudarshan on an elephant, escorted him home with honor, amidst music and fanfare, through the heart of the city.

The queen, upon realizing the truth, was deeply remorseful. She hanged herself. "The sinner who commits adultery falls of his own accord." The pandita also fled from there and reached Pataliputra Nagar, where she stayed with Devadattaganika. She constantly praised Sudarshan in front of Devadatta; this aroused a strong desire in Devadatta's heart to see Sudarshan. Sudarshan, renouncing the world, took monastic initiation. Like the ocean, known as the Ratnakar, is a treasure trove of jewels, so too, the Gunaratnakar, with the permission of his guru, became thin-bodied through penance. Sudarshan Muni, a solitary ascetic, carrying an image, wandered from village to village and reached Pataliputra. While he was wandering through the city for alms, the pandita suddenly saw him and requested him to accept alms. The selfless and detached muni, without considering gain or loss, went to her place for the sake of pure alms. Devadatta closed the door and, throughout the day, tempted him with various allurements. But the muni did not waver even slightly from his great vows. Knowing the muni to be steadfast, Devadatta opened the door in the evening and dismissed him. The muni went straight to a garden where the queen had died and become a Vyantari. Upon seeing Sudarshan Muni, she remembered the events of her previous life and began to torment the equanimous muni in various ways. Truly, the debt and enmity of beings do not end even after countless births. Vyantari greatly harassed the great-souled Sudarshan, but he, through the yoga of auspicious contemplation, attained the state of A-puurvakarana. Gradually ascending the क्षपकश्रेणि, he attained brilliant Kevalgyan right there. Immediately, the gods and demons celebrated the Kevalgyan festival there. Sudarshan Muni, the Kevalgyani, the savior of beings trapped in the ocean of existence, preached dharma. The rise of great men is for the rise of the people. Their dharma preaching not only benefited other beings, but also Devadatta, the pandita, and Vyantari (Abhaya). Sudarshan Muni was one whose soul was not tainted even when he was near women! By preaching his auspicious dharma, he enlightened countless beings and gradually attained the supreme abode. For a person who obtains the Jineendra dharma-shastra and has devotion and love for it, attaining liberation is not difficult. This is the essence of the story of Sudarshan Muni. || 101 ||

Yogashastra dvitiya prakash sloka 102 se 105 .158. Aishvarya-raja-rajopi, rupa-mina-dhvajopi ca | Sitaya ravana iva, tyajya naryanarah parah ||102|| 
Artha:- Sampatti mein rajaon ka raja ho, roop mein kamdeva jaisa ho to bhi Sita ne Ravana ko tyaga vaise anya striyon ko par purush ka tyag karna chahiye.||102||
Vyakhya:- Dharmakaarya ka adhikari kevala purush hi nahin hai, striyon ka bhi poora adhikar hai. Kyonki tirthankaraon ke chaturvarnya shramana-sangha mein sadhvi aur shravika ko bhi sthan hai, ve bhi sangha ki ang maani gayi hai. Is karan jaise grihasthapur-ush ke liye parastri-sevan varjit hai, vaise hi grihasthastriyon ke liye bhi parapurush-sevan ka nishekh hai. Atas jaise Sita ne Ravana ka tyag kiya tha, vaise hi stri ko pati ke atirikta tamam parapurushon ka tyag karna chahiye. Sita ka charittra poorva mein kaha hua hai.||102||

Useful Moral Teachings for Observing Brahmacharya (Celibacy)

Yoga Shastra, Second Canto, Verse 105:

The dull-witted human youth embraces the breasts of young women with delight, but forgets the pain caused by the hell-like torment. The simple-minded being dwells amidst women who cast sidelong glances at him moment by moment, but forgets that he is in the midst of the ocean of transmigration. The lustful man is attracted to the triple-fold (triveni) waves of the bellies of deluded women, but does not realize that this is the Vaitarani River that drowns him in the ocean of existence.

The man's lust-afflicted mind remains submerged in the pool-like navel of the woman, but does not sink into the tranquil waters of equanimity, the abode of happiness. He knows the ladder for the Kama-deva (god of love) to climb the creeper-like body hair of women, but does not know that this is the iron chain that binds him in the prison of this world.

The wicked man joyfully indulges in the vast hips of the woman, but does not know that she is the shore of this ocean of existence. The dull-witted man, like a donkey, considers himself fortunate to enjoy the thighs of young women, but does not understand that these women are the obstacles to attaining the right path.

Thinking himself blessed after being kicked by women, he does not realize that they are pushing him down to a lower state of existence. Wise men should renounce such women who destroy the virtuous life of a person through their sight, touch, and embrace, considering them as venomous serpents.

Women are crooked like the crescent moon, momentary in their passion like the redness of evening, and downward-going like a river, and therefore, they are to be abandoned. The lust-blinded women do not see anything - neither dignity, courtesy, charity, honor, self-interest, nor the interest of others. The harm caused by an enraged lion, tiger, or snake is less than the unlimited harm caused by an unrestrained woman.

The women who are the embodiment of lust are like elephants, capable of striking the whole world. Therefore, they should be avoided from a distance. Recite any mantra or worship any deity that can protect you from the demoness-like nature of women that can destroy your life.

It is universally accepted that women are unchaste and prone to fall into sensual indulgence. It seems as if the cruel Brahma has created women by combining the tongue of the serpent Yama and the sprout of poison. While lightning may sometimes become stable, the wind may stop blowing, but a woman's mind never remains steady.

Even the most intelligent men are deceived without the use of mantras and tantras, so where did women learn this illusionary art? Women also possess the remarkable skill of lying, where they can conceal even the most obvious misdeeds with such finesse that the listener will believe it to be completely true.

Just as a person afflicted with jaundice considers a yellow stone to be gold, or a deluded person considers the pain caused by lust as pleasure, similarly, a person under the influence of infatuation considers the suffering caused by the company of women as happiness. Whether it is a matted-haired ascetic, a topknot-wearing Brahmin, a shaven-headed monk, a silent sage, a naked ascetic, or even Lord Brahma himself, if he is unchaste, I do not like him.

Just as a person who is afflicted with an itch considers the pain of scratching it as pleasure, similarly, a being under the control of the irresistible Cupid considers the suffering of sexual intercourse as happiness. Poets have compared women to golden statues, but why are these lustful men not satisfied by embracing these golden statues?

The despicable and secret parts of women are the ones that infatuate the deluded human, so what else can detach him from them? The truly sad thing is that the ignorant and deluded human even compares the disgusting limbs made of flesh and bones to the moon, lotus, and jasmine, thereby defiling these beautiful objects.

The foolish lustful man places the heavy and thick-bodied woman on his chest during sexual play, but does not realize that this is the stone tied around his neck to drown him in the ocean of existence. Therefore, O wise disciple! Renounce women, considering them as the tides of the ocean of existence, the prey of the hunter called lust, the intoxicating liquor that makes one mad, the mirage of sensual objects in the desert, the darkness of the new moon night, and the mine of calamities.

## Description of the Magnitude of Attachment

**Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 107**

Now, after explaining the fruit of delusion (attachment), we present the description of the fifth Anuvrata as an invitation. 162.

**Verse 106**

*Asantoṣam aviśvāsam ārambham duḥkha kāraṇam | Matvā mūrchā phalam kuryāt, parigraha - niyantranam ||106||*

**Meaning:** Considering dissatisfaction, distrust, and initiation as the fruits of delusion, one should control (restrain) attachment. ||106||

**Explanation:** A Shravak should limit (define the boundaries of) attachment, which is the cause of suffering and the fruit of delusion. Attachment leads to dissatisfaction. No matter how much one gets, they are never satisfied, therefore it is the cause of suffering. Even if someone with delusion gets a lot of wealth, they are not satisfied, but instead feel restless, constantly hoping for more. Seeing the wealth of others, they feel dissatisfied with their own, leading to suffering. Therefore, it is said, "The dissatisfied person is humiliated at every step." On the other hand, the one who has the wealth of contentment is far from the land of evil.

Distrust is also a cause of suffering. When the entire environment becomes untrustworthy, even a man who deserves no suspicion is suspected at every step. One does not trust anyone to protect their wealth. Therefore, it is said, "To uproot, to dig, to hoard, to keep, to not sleep at night, to be suspicious even during the day, to plaster with dung, to always mark, to mark in opposition, to initiate violence (like killing someone out of suspicion due to delusion), to initiate violence (like killing someone out of suspicion due to delusion), to give consent to kill (like a son killing his father, a father killing his son, a brother killing his brother for wealth), to take or give bribes, to give or get false testimony, to tell white lies, etc., leads to all kinds of evils." When powerful, the greedy person seizes and robs travelers, breaks into walls, makes holes; driven by greed for wealth, they engage in adultery, and work in jobs, farming, animal husbandry, or trade. The wealth-obsessed person, like a merchant, endures the pain of entering rivers, etc., to extract wood.

Here, the question arises: How can one understand the statement that one should renounce attachment, knowing that it is the cause of suffering, in a logical way? In response, it is said: Attachment is the cause of delusion, therefore attachment itself is a form of delusion. Or, according to the sutrakar, "Murchha parigrahaḥ," delusion itself is attachment. This statement is from the perspective of certainty. If one has wealth, grain, etc., without delusion, then it is non-attachment. This statement is also from the perspective of certainty. It is said, "Even if a person is adorned with clothes, ornaments, etc., without ego or possessiveness, they are still non-attached. And, even if a person with ego and possessiveness is naked, they are still attached." Even when entering a village or house, if one takes action or receives a small amount of something without attachment or possessiveness, then there is no one more non-attached than them. Whatever clothes, vessels, blankets, or mats they take, they do so for the journey of restraint and to avoid shame. The great sage Lord Mahavira, who crossed the ocean of the world, did not call this attachment. (Dashavaikalika 6/20-21) All these statements are clear. ||106||

**Now, we explain the need to renounce attachment in a different way.**

**Verse 107**

*Parigraham ahatvāddhi, majjaty eva bhavāmbudhau | Mahāpota iva prāṇī, tyajet tasmāt parigraham ||107||*

**Meaning:** Just as a ship sinks in the ocean due to excessive weight, so too does a being sink in the ocean of the world due to the burden of attachment. Therefore, one should renounce attachment. ||107||

**Explanation:** Just as a ship filled with excessive goods like unlimited wealth, grain, etc., sinks in the ocean due to its heavy load, so too does a being sink into hellish states due to the burden of attachment if they possess unlimited wealth, grain, houses, buildings, land, property, and fields, i.e., more than what is necessary. It is said, "Great initiation, great attachment, meat-eating, and the killing of five-sense beings, if any one of these four exists, the being earns hell, and due to excessive initiation and excessive attachment, they bind themselves to hellish existence." External initiation...

From the second light of Yoga Shastra, verses 108 to 109: "Possessions are the life of hell" (Tattvartha 6/16). Therefore, one should renounce possessions in the form of delusion and attachment to wealth, grain, etc., and also renounce any excess material possessions as possessions. ||107||

The faults of possessions are generally described. ||164|| Even a speck of dust here, no virtue exists. But faults as large as mountains arise from possessions. ||108|| Meaning: In this possession, there is no virtue even as much as a speck of dust; rather, it gives rise to faults as large as mountains. ||108|| Explanation: Very fine, unstable dust particles are seen coming in through the window of a house along with the rays of the sun. There is no benefit from possessions even as much as those dust particles; nor does any being attain any kind of perfection or success in the next life by virtue of possessions, nor has it ever happened. Possessions are certainly used in consumption or enjoyment, etc., but that is not a virtue, rather, it is the fault of attachment arising from possessions, and the harm of karma-bondage, etc. The virtue of possessions that is described in the scriptures in the form of building Jain temples, shelters, etc., is not that virtue (in the form of karma-destruction), but it is described as the form of the proper use of possessions (in the form of merit from being the cause of the dharma-meditation, enlightenment, etc., of many people). In reality, if one looks, the one who acquires possessions to build Jain temples, etc., does not have the intention of welfare (in the form of karma-destruction). It is better not to desire wealth for the sake of religious work than to desire wealth for the sake of religious work. It is better to avoid touching mud from afar than to put your foot in mud and then wash it later. Because a person who builds a Jain temple with golden steps and thousands of pillars, and with a golden floor, even from that (work in the form of merit-bondage), there is more (fruit in the form of karma-destruction, purification, and dharma) in penance, restraint, or observance of vows. Therefore, it is clearly stated in the "Sambohasattari Vritti" that there is infinite virtue in penance and restraint compared to (worship of wealth). ||108||

The fact that "great faults like mountains arise from possessions" is explained in detail in another way. ||165|| From attachment, even those who are not enemies become enemies, such as anger and hatred. Even a sage's mind becomes unsteady, because of the one whose self is agitated by it. ||109|| Meaning: From attachment to possessions, enemies like anger, hatred, etc., arise which were not there before. Because even the mind of a sage becomes unsteady and deviates from restraint due to the influence of possessions. ||109|| Explanation: From attachment to possessions, those enemies that are opposed to the virtues of the self, such as anger, hatred, etc., which were not present in the state of arising, also manifest. From attachment to possessions, attachment (attachment, delusion, ego, delusion, desire, greed, etc.) arises; hatred (opposition, enmity, hatred, jealousy, strife, fault-finding, etc.) arises towards the one who obstructs or harms it. And from these anger, hatred, etc., arise fear, delusion, lust, etc., bondage, bondage, etc., and the faults of going to hell, etc. The question arises, where and how do those anger, hatred, etc., which do not exist, manifest? In answer to this, it is said - let alone the Shravakas and other householders; even the peaceful mind of a great vow-taker, a sage, becomes agitated by attachment to possessions. This means that the mind of a sage also becomes unstable from the collection of unnecessary things or from being near things. And it becomes afflicted by either the family of anger or the family of hatred. In this way, a sage also becomes corrupt from the attachment to possessions. It is also said - from wealth, there is cutting, piercing (killing), danger, hardship, suffering, fear, bitter fruit, death, corruption of dharma, and mental unrest (disturbance), etc., all sorrows. Therefore, the ancient sages have forbidden the root possession of hundreds of faults. Because wealth is the root of many misfortunes. If one has once vomited (renounced) wealth, why does he do penance and restraint in vain if he desires to take it again? (Up. Mala 50-52) Does possession not lead to killing, bondage, killing, cutting, etc., and to unrighteousness? If the same possession comes into the dharma of a sage, then it will truly become a worldly affair. ||109|| After describing the faults of possessions in general, it is now connected with the basic Shravaka dharma.

## The Evils of Attachment

**Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verses 110-112, 166**

**Verse 110:**

The root of the world is the beginning of suffering (pain or death), and the root cause of these beginnings is attachment. Therefore, the ascetic or the lay follower should keep their possessions as minimal as possible. This means they should set a limit on their possessions and not exceed it.

**Verse 111:**

Those who are bound by attachment to gold, wealth, grain, etc., are robbed by thieves in the form of worldly desires; they are burned by the fire of lust; and they are trapped in the web of worldly illusion by the hunter in the form of women.

**Explanation:**

Just as thieves rob a person with wealth and gold in the forest, similarly, in the forest of the world, worldly desires in the form of thieves rob a person of their wealth of self-control, leaving them as beggars. In the same way, a person with excessive possessions cannot escape quickly when a fire breaks out, similarly, a person dwelling in the forest of the world is burning in the fire of lust, which manifests in ten forms. Alternatively, a person with excessive possessions is stopped by greedy robbers in the forest, preventing them from moving forward. Similarly, in the forest of existence, lustful women, greedy for wealth or bodily pleasures, stop a man attached to possessions from moving forward on the path of self-control. It is said that no matter how much one possesses, their desires are never fulfilled, but instead, dissatisfaction grows. The scriptures state that even if a greedy person were to possess countless mountains of gold and silver, the size of Mount Kailash and the Himalayas, they would still not be satisfied. This is because desires are infinite like the sky. (Utt. 9/48) The Agamas also state that even if someone were to possess the entire earth, filled with wealth, grain, gold, silver, and animals, it would still not be enough to satisfy their desires. Knowing this, one should strive for knowledge and austerity. Poets have also said that the pit of greed is so deep and boundless that no matter how much is poured into it, it will never be filled. The wonder is that even if large mountains are thrown into the pit of greed, it remains empty. Just as miners dig deeper and deeper into a mine, the pit grows larger. Similarly, the more a person strives for wealth, the deeper the pit of dissatisfaction becomes. Alternatively, someone who has climbed a great mountain desires to ascend to the sky. Can they ascend to the sky?

**Verse 112:**

Emperor Sagar was not satisfied even after having sixty thousand sons. Kuchikarna was not satisfied even after having many herds of cows. Tilakseth was not satisfied even after having many granaries full of grain. And King Nanda was not satisfied even after having mountains of gold. Therefore, attachment is the cause of dissatisfaction.

**Now we will narrate the story of Sagar, etc.**

**Sagar, the Emperor, Greedy for Sons:**

In those days, King Jitashatru ruled Ayodhya. His younger brother, Sumitra, was the crown prince. Both brothers ruled the earth. King Jitashatru had a son, Tirthankara Ajitnath, and Crown Prince Sumitra had a son, Sagar, the Emperor. After both Jitashatru and Sumitra took initiation, Ajitswami became the king, and Sagar became the crown prince. After some time, Ajitnath took initiation, and Sagar, like Bharat, became the Emperor.

The Tale of Sagarchari
The vast Mahavrksha, like thousands of branches, removes the fatigue of the travelers who take the path of Yoga Shastra, the second light, verse 112. Sagarchari had 60,000 sons. The eldest of Sagar's sons was Janhukumar. Once, his father was pleased with his work and gave him a boon. Once, Janhukumar expressed his desire to his father - 'Father! Today, I want this as the boon that was kept in trust, that I get the Dandaratan etc. of the Chakravarti, with which I can tour this Bhu Mandal with my brothers.' Sagar gave him those gems and gave him permission to tour. Janhu and other Sagarputra, wearing thousands of umbrellas brighter than the sun, took their father's blessings and worshipped each Jinbimb with great devotion and great devotion, and while traveling, one day they came near the Ashtapada mountain. Janhukumar climbed that mountain, 8 yojan high and 4 yojan wide, with his brothers and family, and there was a temple, one yojan long, half yojan wide, three kos high, with four doors, they all entered it. In that temple were the images of the present twenty-four Tirthankaras, with their respective institutions, dimensions and colors. They worshipped them in order, then they worshipped the holy stupas of the 100 brothers built by Bharat. Then, filled with devotion, they thought for a while and said in a loud voice - In my opinion, there is no place (Tirth) like Ashtapada anywhere else. I will also build a similar Chaitya. These Chaityas are the essence of Bharatkhund, the memorials of their Chakravartitva of Bharatkhund, located on the peak of this mountain since Bharat Chakravarti attained liberation. No future king should destroy these Chaityas built by them, so we should make arrangements for their protection. After that, he took the Dandaratan, presided over by thousands of gods, in his hand and rotated it around Ashtapada. Due to this, a pit, a thousand yojan deep, like a gourd, was formed in the ground below. And the buildings of the Nagadevas, the Bhavanpati, which were built in the Patala Lok below, were broken.
From this unexpected calamity, the gods came to the shelter of their lord Jwalanprabh, terrified. He knew from his Avadhigyan that this was all Janhukumar's doing. Therefore, he became angry and went to Janhukumar and rebuked him - Oh, Madommat! Why did you tear up so much land in such a terrible way without any reason and kill countless living beings? Nephew of Tirthankar Ajitanath and son of Sagarchari! Shameless family disgrace! Why did you commit this crime? To this, Janhukumar said - I did this to protect the stupas (Chaityas) here. The destruction of your buildings has happened due to my ignorance. Therefore, please forgive me. To this, Jwalanprabh Dev said - This mistake of yours has happened due to ignorance, so I forgive you. Don't make such a mistake again in the future. Saying this, the god returned to his place. Janhukumar then discussed with his brothers that we have made this ditch with the Dandaratan, but in time this ditch will be filled with dust. Therefore, let us pull the Ganges river here with this same Dandaratan and let its flow fall into this ditch. They did the same. But that water again damaged the buildings of the Nagakumaras. Therefore, Jwalanprabhdev, angry with the Nagakumaras, came and burnt them all to ashes, just as a wildfire burns all the trees. Seeing this, the soldiers thought sadly - Our lord was burnt to ashes before our very eyes, we cowards! Thinking this, the soldiers, ashamed, left from there and went to live near Ayodhya. They started to exchange thoughts again and again that how will we tell our lord? And how will we mention this tragic incident in front of him? One day a Brahmin came and met them; they told him their whole story and asked for his opinion. The Brahmin said - Don't worry. I will speak to the king in such a way that the king will not grieve and his anger will also subside from you. Giving this assurance, the Brahmin went to the royal court with an orphan dead (corpse) and started to wail loudly there - Alas! My only son is dead. The king asked him the reason for his wailing, then he said - My only son has fainted from snakebite. Therefore, Dev! Please bring him back to life. The king called those who could remove snake venom and

The Story of Sagar Chakravarti
Yoga Shastra Second Light Verse 112
| He was ordered to remove the poison. He used his mantra skills to remove the poison in many ways, but it proved futile like putting ghee in ashes. The dead person could not be revived. But on the other hand, it was not easy to convince the grieving | Brahmin. So the king explained with a strategy - Vipravar! You do this, from whose house no one has died till date, bring a handful of ashes from there. That's it, when I get the ashes, I will revive your son. As soon as the king said this, the Brahmin said happily - This is a very easy thing. The Brahmin left from there and went from village to village | and city to city searching for ashes. But no such house was found; where no one had died till date. | The Brahmin returned empty-handed in despair, then the king said - 'Vipravar! Did you bring the ashes? The Brahmin said| Maharaj! No such house was found where no one died. So now you give me such ashes. The king said| Even in my family, Lord Rishabhdev, Bharat Chakravarti, Bahubali, Suryayasha, Somayasha etc. many people have passed away, someone | went to moksha, someone went to heaven, King Jitashatru went to moksha, King Sumitra went to Devalok. So death is common to all. When so many died and we endured their separation, then why can't you bear the separation of your one son? | take it? The Brahmin said - Maharaj! Your words are true. But I have only one son, so you should save him. | It is the rule of the righteous to protect the poor and the orphans. The Chakravarti said - Vipravar! Don't grieve! The only way to be free from the sorrow of death in the world is to take refuge in the feeling of detachment. The Brahmin answered him in the same coin | - Prithvinath! If this is the case, then you should not grieve even for the death of your sixty thousand sons. | should. The king was startled to hear this and said - What did you say? My 60 thousand sons died? How did they die? Is there not even one left? | What happened? Tell me this in detail? On this, the soldiers who had been signaled beforehand came and narrated the whole story from beginning to end. | Hearing this terrible news, Sagar Chakravarti suddenly fainted and fell down on the earth with a thud, just like | as a thunderbolt falls on a mountain. As soon as the fainting spell ended, the king regained consciousness. For a while, the king cried like ordinary people. He became disgusted with the world by this incident. He started thinking - My sons will enhance the glory of my lineage, they will give me happiness, with this hope, even though I considered the world to be impermanent, I did not think anything. Damn me! Even with so many sons, I was not satisfied, then how would it be possible if two or four more sons were born? In my lifetime, suddenly | This happened to my sons, and they could not give me any satisfaction! Alas! This is the wicked play of the world. Getting caught in it is just to lose life in vain. In this way, Sagar Chakravarti, after crowning Bhagirath, the son of Janhukumara, | took initiation at the feet of Lord Ajitnath and attained Akshayapad by observing restraint. This is a brief account of the life of Sagar Chakravarti!
Kuchikarna's Attachment to Cows:
There was a village called Sughoosha in Magadhdesh. There lived a famous village headman named Kuchikarna. He slowly | collected one lakh cows. A lake is filled by drop by drop. He entrusted those cows to different cowherds to raise them by making separate herds. But those cowherds started quarreling among themselves, one said - My cow is beautiful. The other says - Your cow is not beautiful, my cow is beautiful, seeing them fighting, Kuchikarna separated those cows into different divisions, giving some white, some black, some yellow, some Kapila names and established different Gokuls in different forests. He himself also lived in Gokul and ate milk, curd. Just as a drunkard remains unsatisfied even after drinking enough liquor, in the same way, Kuchikarna also remained unsatisfied even after consuming so much milk and curd. | was. Due to excessive consumption of milk and curd, he developed indigestion with juice spreading up and down in his body. | His stomach burned so much, as if he was lying in fire. He shouted loudly - Alas! When will I get my cows, bulls, calves again? In this way, Kuchikarna, who was unsatisfied with his cattle wealth, died there and was born in the animal realm.

The Story of Gau Sangrahi Kuchikarna, Tilak Seth, and Nand Raja

**Chapter 2 of Yoga Shastra, Verse 112: The Consequences of Tilak Seth's Attachment to Grain**

In ancient times, there lived a merchant named Tilak Shreshthi in the city of Achalpur. He collected grain from cities and villages. He would sell his customers pulses like urad, moong, sesame seeds, rice, wheat, chickpeas, etc. at a rate of one and a half times the price. After the harvest, he would collect one and a half times the price from them. How could grain increase from grain, grain from animals, and grain from wealth? By what means could grain increase? He would contemplate this day and night, like a deep thinker, and buy grain and sell it at the aforementioned profit. When a person becomes obsessed with something, it becomes an addiction, and their attachment to it does not fade. This was the case with Tilak Seth. He did not care that millions of insects died due to his grain collection. He did not feel any compassion for the pain that the five-sense beings and humans suffered from the burden of grain. Once, a wise man told him, "There will be a famine next year." Upon hearing this, he used all his wealth to buy grain. Even after buying so much grain, he was not satisfied. Therefore, he borrowed money from the wealthy at interest and bought and collected various types of grains. When he ran out of warehouses to store the grain, he filled his own house with it. What does a greedy man not do? After doing all this, he became indifferent, considering the enemy of the world, famine, as a friend, and waited for its arrival. But what happened was contrary to his anxious thoughts. At the beginning of the rainy season, clouds rose in the sky, as if tearing through his heart, and began to thunder. Soon, heavy rain began to fall all around. As a result, the various grains he had collected, including wheat, moong, rice, and chickpeas, began to rot. Seeing this, the dissatisfied Tilak Seth began to lament, "Alas! My grain will be destroyed. Now my grain will be lost." Thus, lamenting, "Alas! Alas!" his heart burst from being unsatisfied, and he died immediately and went to hell. This is the result of Tilak Shreshthi's excessive greed!

**The Wealth-Hungry Nand Raja**

In ancient times, there was a magnificent city called Pataliputra, which followed the example of Indranagar. There ruled a king named Nand, who was like Indra in subduing his enemies and was the ruler of three parts of the world. He imposed taxes on those who were not already taxed. He increased the taxes on those who were already taxed, and he imposed other taxes on those who paid more. In this way, he would accuse people of any crime and take money from them as punishment. He would always say, "The king can deceive, but he cannot be deceived. Just as the ocean is the container of all waters, so the king is the container of all wealth, there is no other!" And in this way, he tried to collect wealth from the people by any means possible. Therefore, in a few years, the people became impoverished. There was not even grass left on the land for sheep and goats to graze. He erased the name and form of gold coins for exchange and introduced leather coins in their place. He would heavily punish hypocrites and prostitutes and take money from them in return. Since fire consumes everything and leaves no one, people began to say, seeing his behavior, "After 1900 years of the Nirvana of Lord Mahavira, the Kalki Raja is going to be born; according to that prophecy, is this not the Kalki Raja?" Seeing the fierce anger of Nand Raja, people began to eat in earthenware pots instead of bronze or brass pots. Many people, out of fearlessness, gave their pots to others, thinking that if they had pots, they would be afraid of being taken away by the king. In this way, the extremely greedy Nand Raja built mountains of gold, filled wells with gold, and filled all his treasuries with gold, yet his desire was not fulfilled.

When a benevolent king of Ayodhya heard about his behavior, he was very saddened. He sent a clever messenger to him to try to reason with him. The messenger arrived there and, to seize all the wealth and fortune,

---------------------------
The avaricious Nanda Raja, a king devoid of energy and splendor, was approached by a messenger. After greeting the king, the messenger sat before him. Seeking permission from the king, the messenger said, "Do not be angry upon hearing my master's message. Those who speak sweetly are never well-wishers. I had heard of your misdeeds from the lineage of my ancestors, but today I have experienced them firsthand. The words of the people are not entirely baseless. Even a small portion of wealth acquired through injustice washes away all the glory of a king. Even a single seed of a gourd destroys the sweetness of jaggery. A king should consider his subjects as his own soul. It is not right for a king to destroy his subjects. A carnivore never eats its own flesh. Therefore, nourish your subjects. Nourished subjects nourish the king. Even a cow, being meek and submissive, does not give milk without being nourished with fodder and grains. Greed is the destroyer of all virtues. Therefore, abandon greed. Our beloved king has sent this message for your benefit."

Just as hot smoke rises when water falls on land burnt by a forest fire, so too, upon hearing the messenger's words, Nanda Raja uttered words like hot smoke, "Enough, be quiet, I don't need your advice. You are unworthy because you are a messenger; leave this place!" Saying this, Nanda Raja immediately got up and went to his inner chambers like a patient suffering from a headache. "Just as the Javasā does not accept the flow of water, so too, this king does not accept my flow of advice, therefore he is unworthy of advice." Thinking this, the messenger returned to Ayodhya to his king.

As a result of the sin of injustice, terrible and painful diseases arose in Nanda Raja's body. These diseases caused him so much pain, as if it were the torment inflicted by the Asuras in hell. As the king groaned in pain from this terrible suffering, the people rejoiced. Nanda Raja's body and mind were in such terrible pain, as if he were being cooked in fire, or roasted like chickpeas in a pan, or scorched in fire. For a sinner, all this is considered very little. Alas! On this earth, I have built mountains of gold, piled up heaps of gold everywhere; who will now be the owner of this? I could not enjoy even a little bit of this gold. Alas! I was only busy thinking of ways to collect gold, day and night! What will happen to me now?

Thus, lamenting and in a deep swoon over his possessions, the insatiable Nanda Raja passed away. He experienced the boundless suffering of the world. This is the story of Nanda's attachment!

Now we present the fact that even the vows of yogis who desire to acquire possessions are harmed. 169. Those yogis who are afflicted by the planet of attachment abandon the wealth of the kingdom of peace, which is the family of austerity and knowledge. 113. Meaning: Even yogis, who are afflicted by the planet of attachment, abandon the wealth of the kingdom of peace, which is the family of austerity and knowledge. 113. Explanation: Let alone ordinary humans, even yogis adorned with the three jewels of knowledge, vision, and character, if they become greedy for even a little pleasure, trapped in the clutches of the planet of attachment, they abandon the wealth of the kingdom of peace, which is the family of austerity, renunciation, and scriptural knowledge, like their subdued ghosts and spirits. That is, they abandon their fundamental virtues and become subservient to the demon of greed. 113.

Having explained the consequences of dissatisfaction, we now explain the consequences of satisfaction. 170. The happiness that is not attained by a dissatisfied person, whether he be Indra or a Chakravarti, is attained by a satisfied person like the happiness of the kingdom of peace attained by Abhayakumar. 114. Meaning: The happiness that is not attained by a dissatisfied person, whether he be Indra or a Chakravarti, is attained by a satisfied person like the happiness of the kingdom of peace attained by Abhayakumar. 114. The story of Abhayakumar, which is understood by the tradition, is as follows. 178

The Glory of Contentment and the Wise Abhayakumar
Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 114, The Content Abhayakumar:

In ancient times, India was adorned with a prosperous region, the city of Rajagriha, which was embellished with a vast fort. There reigned King Prasenajit, who was as deep as the ocean, attracting all kings with his virtues. He was a devout Shravak, a follower of the Jain faith, who practiced Anuvratas, as devoted as a bee to Lord Parshvanath. He had many sons, including Shrenik, who surpassed even the celestial beings in strength, brilliance, and radiance. Among all these sons, who was worthy of taking over the reins of the kingdom? To test them, the king one day had all his sons seated for a meal and served them kheer (sweet rice pudding). As they began to eat, the wise king released ferocious hunting dogs with gaping mouths like tigers. As the dogs approached, all the princes except Shrenik jumped up from their plates and rushed out. Shrenik, however, continued to feed the dogs small portions of kheer from his plate, and by the time the dogs had finished licking it up, he had finished his own kheer. Seeing this, the king thought, "This prince alone will be able to subdue enemies by any means and enjoy this earth." King Prasenajit was very pleased with Shrenik.

One day, King Prasenajit again tested his sons by giving them sealed laddoos (sweet balls) in baskets and water in clay pots with their mouths sealed, and told them, "Open these baskets without opening the lids or breaking the seals, and drink water from these pots without making holes in them." Except for Shrenik, none of the princes could eat the laddoos or drink the water. No matter how strong a man is, what he can do with intelligence, he cannot do with strength. Shrenik shook the basket and made the laddoos crumble through the holes, and ate them. Similarly, water was dripping from the bottom of the pot, which he collected in a silver cup and drank. What is impossible for the intelligence of a quick-witted person? Seeing Shrenik's intellectual skill, the king was very pleased.

One day, a fire broke out in Prasenajit's palace. He then said to all his princes, "Take whatever you can from my palace. Whatever you take will be yours." Hearing this, the other princes took precious jewels and came out, but Shrenik only took a drum for beating. The king asked Shrenik, "Son! What is this, and why did you bring it?" Shrenik replied, "This is a drum, the first sign of the victory of kings. The sound of this drum makes the victory march of kings successful. Therefore, my lord! This drum, which signifies the victory of kings, should be protected like its soul."

Seeing Shrenik pass the test, King Prasenajit, acknowledging his sharp intelligence, affectionately gave him the second name "Bhambasar." King Prasenajit did not consider the other princes worthy of ruling, as they considered themselves worthy of the throne. However, King Prasenajit pretended to ignore Shrenik, wanting to test his intelligence further. He gave the other princes kingdoms in different countries. But he gave nothing to Shrenik, thinking that this entire kingdom would eventually be his.

After this, like a young elephant emerging from the forest, Shrenik, filled with pride, left his city, seeing his father's attitude, and reached the city of Venatat. As he entered the city, he sat in the shop of a wealthy merchant, as if he were the embodiment of prosperity. That day, there was a festival in the city, so there was a long queue of customers at the merchant's shop, buying fine clothes and fragrant substances related to angarags (robes). The merchant was overwhelmed by the large crowd. So, Shrenik quickly helped the customers by tying up bundles and giving them their purchases. Due to Shrenik's influence, the merchant made a lot of money that day. Truly, with a virtuous man, wealth follows him even in a foreign land. Seeing this, the merchant asked with pleasure, "Whose virtuous guest are you today?" The prince said, "Yours!" The merchant

The Story of Abhay Kumar

The second light of the Yoga Shastra, verse 114, thought to himself - "Last night in my dream I saw a worthy groom for Nanda; it seems to be him." Therefore, he said openly - "Today you have become my guest, I am blessed by this. Your arrival is like the arrival of the Ganges at the house of the devout." Closing his shop, Seth Shrenik Kumar took him to his house. There he made him bathe, dressed him in new fine clothes and fed him with respect. Many days passed while Seth stayed there. One day Seth, bringing his daughter before him, requested Kumar - "Please agree to marry my daughter named Nanda." Shrenik said to Seth - "How can you give your daughter to me, an unknown person?" Seth said - "Your qualities have revealed your lineage and character." Seeing his great insistence, Shrenik married Nanda in the same way that Vishnu married the daughter of the ocean (Lakshmi). After the marriage, Shrenik lived there with Nanda, enjoying pleasures, just as an elephant lives happily in a grove.

King Senajit learned the whole story of Shrenik through his spies. Because the king could see through the eyes of his spies, he was like one with a thousand eyes. Suddenly, a terrible illness arose in the body of King Prasenajit. He tried many treatments, but it wouldn't go away. Therefore, knowing his end was near, he ordered a swift camel driver to bring his son Shrenik. The camel driver quickly reached the city of Venatat. He met Shrenik and said - "Your father is lying on his deathbed, counting his last moments. He has sent me to bring you quickly." Hearing this, Shrenik was very saddened. He explained to Nandadevi and gave her the following mantra - "We are the Gopals of Rajagah, the city with white walls." Then Shrenik bid farewell to his in-laws and quickly left from there. His father was suffering from an incurable disease. He was afraid that if he didn't go, his father might pass away in his absence or suffer more pain. With this in mind, Shrenik quickly reached Rajagah on a she-camel. When the king saw Shrenik standing before him with folded hands, his joy overflowed. Then, he performed Shrenik's coronation with the pure water of a golden pot and declared him the king of Magadh. King Prasenajit, remembering Lord Parshvanath and chanting the Panchparameshthi mantra, attained death in samadhi and reached the heavenly realm.

King Shrenik took charge of the entire kingdom. Meanwhile, in Venatat, Nandadevi, abandoned by King Shrenik, became pregnant. At that time, she had a dream - "Riding an elephant, I will give protection to all beings with great pomp and become devoted to the welfare of others." Nandadevi's father requested the king. Therefore, the king fulfilled her dream. At the right time, Nandadevi gave birth to a healthy and beautiful child, just as the eastern direction gives birth to the sun. On the auspicious day, according to her dream, her grandfather named the child Abhay Kumar. He grew up gradually. He studied all the arts without fault. By the age of eight, Abhay Kumar had become proficient in 72 arts. One day, Abhay Kumar was playing with his friends when a boy tauntingly said to him with anger - "Why are you boasting so much? You don't even know your father." Abhay Kumar replied - "My father's name is..." The boy replied - "He is your mother's father." Abhay Kumar felt those words like arrows piercing him. At that moment, he asked his mother Nandadevi - "Mother! Who is my father?" "Bhadraseth is your father." Nanda said. "Bhadraseth is your father. Tell me the name of my father, whoever he may be." After repeatedly asking with letters, Nandadevi said sadly - "Son! My father married me to a young man who had come from a foreign land. When you were in my womb, a camel driver came from somewhere. He spoke to him in private and quickly took your father away on a camel. After that, there was no trace of him. Therefore, I don't know the truth - who he was? Where he was from? What was his name?" Abhay asked - "Mother! Did he say anything while leaving?" Then Nanda brought the written mantra and showed it to her son, saying - "He gave me these letters while leaving." Reading the words written in the letter, Abhay Kumar was very happy...

Becoming the Minister of Abhaya
Yoga Shastra Second Light Verse 114 happened and he said to his mother - 'Mother! My father is the king of Rajgriha. Let's go there now.' Taking leave from Bhadreseth, mother and son reached Rajgriha city with their belongings. Leaving his mother with the family in a garden outside the city, Abhaykumar entered the city with a few people.
Meanwhile, King Shrenik had gathered 499 ministers to deliberate at that time. And to complete the number 500, a search was being made for such an outstanding man everywhere. To test that person, King Shrenik had dropped his ring in a dry well and announced - whoever stands by the edge of the well and catches this ring with his hand, he will be the intelligent and great leader of all these ministers. Hearing the announcement, all the ministers were in a dilemma. They started saying to each other - This task seems impossible for us. Only one who can pluck stars from the sky and bring them to earth can take this ring out of the well and catch it with his hand. This is not our job. At that time, Abhaykumar arrived there laughing. Seeing and hearing the people talking among themselves, he asked - Can't this ring be taken? Is this a difficult thing? Hearing his argument, the people thought - This is some influential man of talent. When the time comes, the word spoken by the person reveals his prowess. The gathered people said to Abhaykumar - Fortunate! According to the king's condition, take the ring and accept the leadership of all the ministers. Abhaykumar threw fresh cow dung on the ring lying in the well while standing on the edge; and at the same time put burning grass stalks on it; from which that dung dried up. At the same time, Abhaykumar had a water tank made and filled the well with water. To the astonishment of the people, the dung immediately floated up with the ring. Therefore, Shrenikputra Abhay caught the dung with the ring in his hand at that time. If an intelligent person makes an arrangement with a good trick, then nothing is difficult for him. The spies etc. who were standing there immediately went to the king and gave him this news. Amazed and surprised, King Shrenik called Abhaykumar to him and embraced him with affection, looking at him like a son. 'Even if the relationship is unknown, the mind is delighted to see the relative.' King Shrenik asked Abhay - Where have you come from? I have come from Venatat, Abhay said fearlessly. The king asked him - 'Vats! There is a famous Seth named Bhadar there, his daughter is Nanda, she is happy, isn't she?' Yes, she is happy, Abhay said. Nanda was pregnant; who did she give birth to? Abhaykumar, with a charming row of teeth like rays of light, said - Yes, Dev! She has given birth to a son named Abhay. The king asked again - What is that Abhay like, what is his appearance? What qualities have come in him? Abhay said - Consider me to be Abhay; I am the same. Hearing this, Abhaykumar was embraced and seated on his lap and kissed on the forehead, and he was delighted to shed tears, as if he was bathing him with affection. 'Your mother is well, isn't she?' On asking this, Abhaykumar folded his hands and said humbly - 'Swamin! My long-lived mother, remembering your lotus feet like a bee, is currently in the garden outside the city. Hearing this, thrilled with joy, the king, with all his belongings, went towards Nanda with Abhaykumar in front, eager to bring Nanda, just as the royal swan goes towards the lotus. At that time, Nanda's body was becoming thin, the bangles on her hands were becoming loose. Hair was hanging on the skull, there was no kajal in the eyes, the braid was not braided, she was wearing dirty clothes. The king saw Nanda, thin like the art of the second moon, sitting happily in the garden. The king delighted Nanda and took her to his palace. Just as Raghunandan Ram made Sita his queen, so King Shrenik made Nanda his queen! Abhaykumar had great devotion to his father and considered himself equal to an atom in front of him. Due to this humility, he had also brought the difficult king under his control.

Abhayakumar's intelligence caused a rift in Chandapradyota's army.

Yogashastra Dvitiya Prakash, verse 114: Once, Chandapradyota, the king of Ujjayini, set out to besiege Rajagriha with all his resources and forces. Fourteen other crowned kings, all devout followers of their respective religions, accompanied him. The people saw Chandapradyota approaching. His swift horses galloped as if they would tear through the earth. Spies immediately informed King Shrenik. Upon hearing this, Shrenik pondered for a moment, wondering how to weaken Chandapradyota, who was approaching like a furious planet. In that instant, the king looked towards Abhayakumar, a repository of intuitive wisdom, with a gaze as sweet as nectar. True to his name and qualities, Abhayakumar respectfully requested the king, "Today, the king of Ujjayini has become a guest in our war. Why worry so much? To speak of weapons in a matter that can be resolved by intelligence is futile. I will only use my intellect. Intelligence is like a wish-fulfilling cow in achieving victory."

After that, Abhayakumar had gold dinars placed in iron boxes and buried outside the city, where the enemy's camp was located. Just as the water of the ocean surrounds the circular land, Chandapradyota's army surrounded Rajagriha from all sides. Abhayakumar sent a letter through eloquent spies, conveying this message:

"King of Avanti! Do not perceive any difference between Shivadevi and Chillanadavi. Therefore, as Shivadevi, you are always honorable to me. I advise you with sincere good intentions that my father, King Shrenik, has sown discord among all your kings. To subdue them, the king has sent gold coins. By accepting them, they will bind themselves and surrender to my father. If you do not believe me, you can dig beneath their residences and find the buried gold coins for yourself. Who would want to touch fire when there is a burning lamp present?"

Knowing this, Chandapradyota had the ground dug beneath one king's camp. There, as Abhayakumar had said, he found gold coins. Disheartened, Chandapradyota secretly fled from there. With his departure, Shrenik surrounded his entire army, churning it like the ocean. Shrenik seized the army's essential elephants, horses, and other resources. Chandapradyota was cornered. Somehow, he managed to escape with his life, riding a swift horse back to his city. The fourteen kings and other great warriors fled like crows, for an army without a leader is destroyed.

When those kings reached Ujjayini, following behind King Chandapradyota, their hair was disheveled and flying, their faces were gloomy, and none of them had an umbrella over their heads. All those kings swore to Chandapradyota, "Your Majesty! We would never betray you like this. It seems this entire scheme was Abhayakumar's doing." Knowing this, the king of Avanti was filled with rage towards Abhayakumar.

Once, the king of Avanti said angrily in his court, "Whoever binds Abhayakumar and brings him here to me will receive whatever wealth they desire as a reward." A courtesan raised her hand like a flag and volunteered, "Your Majesty! I can do this perfectly." The king readily granted her permission to undertake this task.

He said, "If you need anything, wealth or otherwise, for this task, just ask." The courtesan thought, "Abhayakumar is difficult to capture by any means, only through religious pretense can I succeed in my mission." Therefore, the courtesan requested two elderly women to accompany her. The king, giving her a lot of wealth, arranged for two women to go with the courtesan. Those two women stayed with the courtesan like shadows. Now, these three women always served and worshipped the holy women, showing them respect. Due to their intellectual excellence, they gained a lot of knowledge from the holy women. These three were like three illusions, deceiving the world. They wandered from village to village and reached Rajagriha, the city adorned by King Shrenik. They set up their camp in a garden outside the city. The courtesan, along with her two companions, entered the city, desiring to perform the rituals of the caitya. Then, with great devotion, she entered the city three times, as instructed by the king. After worshipping the image, she began to sing devotional songs in the Malavakoushiki style, with rhythm and melody, in her native language.

Abhay was handed over to Chandapradyot by the Maya-like Shravaka.
Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 114
Abhaykumar had also come to pay homage to the Chaitya. He saw these three women paying homage to the deity in front of the image. Abhaykumar, thinking, 'If I enter, I will disturb them in their worship of the deity,' did not enter the pavilion but stood at the door. When they stood up, having made a vow with the Muktasuktimudra, Abhaykumar also came before them. Seeing their devotion and peaceful attire, Abhaykumar praised them and said happily, "Blessed are you, sisters! It is a great fortune that I have met such virtuous sisters today. In this world, there is no other friend or sister greater than a virtuous person. If you have no objection, tell me who you are, where you come from, and where your home is. Who are these two women, like Chandralekha, adorned with the stars Swati and Vishakha, who are with you?" The fake Shravaka said, "I am the widowed wife of a wealthy merchant from Avanti. After the death of my two sons, I became like a vine without the shade of a tree, without support. These two are my widowed daughters-in-law. After becoming widows, they asked my permission to take the Mahavrat. For widowed women, initiation is the only refuge. I am now tired. Still, I will observe the vows according to the householder's life. But I will do it only after I have gone on a pilgrimage. When one takes the vow of restraint, one can only perform devotional worship. Material worship can only be done in the householder's life, not in the life of a Sadhvi. With this in mind, I have set out on a pilgrimage with these two." Hearing this, Abhaykumar said, "Stay as my guest today. The hospitality of a virtuous person who is going on a pilgrimage is more sacred than the pilgrimage itself." The fake Shravaka replied, "You are right. But because of the pilgrimage, I am fasting today, so how can I be your guest?" Impressed by her devotion, Abhaykumar said again, "Then come to my place tomorrow morning." She replied, "In a moment, life ends. In such a situation, how can any intelligent person say that I will do this tomorrow? Your words are right, then I accept your invitation for tomorrow." Saying this, he took leave of them and went home himself, having paid homage to the Chaitya in the temple.
The next day, in the morning, Abhaykumar invited them and paid homage to the Chaitya in his home temple and performed the devotion of receiving clothes. They also invited Abhaykumar for a day. Trusting them, Abhaykumar went alone to their place. What do virtuous people not do for the sake of a virtuous person? They also fed Abhaykumar various kinds of delicious food. And they gave him Chandrahās, a drink mixed with alcohol. As soon as he got up from the meal, Abhaykumar fell asleep. For the first companion of drinking is sleep. According to the pre-planned arrangement, because of the chariots kept in place, no one knew about this conspiracy, and in a state of unconsciousness, the cunning courtesan took Abhaykumar to Ujjayini.
Meanwhile, King Shrenik sent servants all over to search for Abhaykumar. Searching from place to place, the servants also reached the place where the courtesan was staying. The servants asked her, "Did Abhaykumar come here?" The courtesan said, "Yes, he did come, but he left at the same time." Trusting her words, the searchers went elsewhere. Horses were also kept in place for the prostitute. So she got on a horse and reached Ujjayini. After that, the cunning courtesan, skilled in the art of deception, handed Abhaykumar over to King Chandapradyot. When asked how and in what way she brought him, she told the whole story of her cunning from beginning to end. To this, Chandapradyot said, "You have deceived a religious person, this is not a proper act." Then Chandapradyot said to Abhaykumar, "Just as the parrot who says 'save me from the cat' seventeen times is caught by the cat itself, so too, how did you get caught even though you are a wise man?" Abhaykumar said, "You yourself are wise, that is why you rule the kingdom with such wisdom." Out of shame and anger, Chandapradyot imprisoned Abhaykumar in a wooden cage like a swan. In Chandapradyot's kingdom, there were the Agnibhīru chariot, the Shivadevi, the Nalagiri elephant, and the Lohjangh scribe. The Lohjangh scribe used to be sent to Bhrigukachchha again and again. Because of the scribe's frequent coming and going, the people became distressed and consulted with each other, saying, "This scribe travels twenty-five yojanas a day, and he bothers us again and again, so..." 1. This does not appear in other narratives.

Chandrapradyot was entrusted to Abhaykumar.
Thinking, 'By any means, he should be killed now,' they gave him laddoos mixed with poison in his food on the way.
And they took away all the other things like food (pathya) etc. from him.
Lohjang, after traveling a long distance, sat down to eat by a river.
But knowing that it was an inauspicious time, he went ahead without eating.
Being hungry, he stopped again to eat; the omen told him not to eat this time either.
He went straight to King Chandrapradyot without eating.
And he told him all that had happened.
Chandrapradyot called Abhaykumar and asked him what to do.
The intelligent Abhaykumar sniffed the food kept in the bag and said, 'This contains a poison snake that is born from the combination of such and such substances.
If this leather bag is opened, it will surely burn and be reduced to ashes.'
As per Abhaykumar's instructions, the king sent a servant to throw the bag upside down in the forest and leave it there.
As a result, the trees there were burnt to ashes and the snake also died.
Pleased with Abhaykumar's intelligence, Chandrapradyot said to him, 'Ask for any boon except release from bondage.'
Abhaykumar said, 'Let my boon remain in your custody for now.'
One day, Chandrapradyot's elephant, Nalgiri, uprooted the pillar to which it was tied and threw two mahouts to the ground.
Then, intoxicated, it roamed freely in the city, surprising the city dwellers.
The king asked Abhaykumar, 'How can the wild elephant be tamed?'
Abhaykumar suggested that if King Udayan played music, the elephant could be tamed.
Udayan, who was imprisoned to teach his daughter Vasavadatta the Gandharva Vidya, sang there with Vasavadatta.
Nalgiri, the elephant, was attracted by the music and stopped to listen, when he was tied with strong chains.
The king was again pleased and asked Abhaykumar to ask for a boon.
He also kept it in trust with Abhaykumar.
Once, a fire broke out in Avanti, which could not be extinguished.
King Chandrapradyot again panicked and asked Abhaykumar for a way to extinguish the fire.
Abhaykumar said, 'Poison kills poison, similarly fire extinguishes fire.
Therefore, you light another fire in front of that fire, so that it will extinguish itself.'
This was done.
As a result, the raging fire was extinguished.
Now what, the king asked Abhaykumar to ask for a third boon.
He also kept it in trust.
Once, there was an epidemic in Ujjayini.
People started dying one after another.
The king asked Abhaykumar for a remedy to pacify the epidemic, and he said, 'All the queens should come to you in the inner palace adorned with ornaments, and the queen who wins you over with her sight, you should tell me.
Then I will tell you what to do next.'
The king did the same.
In the battle of sight, all the queens lost, but Shivadevi won over the king.
He called Abhaykumar and told him the whole story.
He said, 'Shivadevi should worship the ghosts with cruel offerings at night.
Whatever ghosts rise in the form of jackals and make a sound, the goddess should put the cruel offering in their mouths herself.'
Shivadevi did the same, as a result, the epidemic subsided.
Pleased with this, the king gave Abhaykumar a fourth boon.
At that time, Abhaykumar asked, 'You should be sitting on the elephant Nalgiri as a mahout, and I should be sitting in Shivadevi's lap, and in this very state, I should enter the pyre made of wood of the Agnibhīru chariot.'
Unable to give this boon, King Chandrapradyot sadly folded his hands and gave permission to Shrenikputra Abhaykumar to go to his city.
Abhaykumar also promised while leaving, 'You have deceitfully caught me and brought me here, but I will take you out of the city shouting loudly in broad daylight.'
From there, Abhaykumar reached Rajgriha.
And the intelligent Abhay spent some time peacefully in Rajgriha.
One day, Abhaykumar, dressed as a merchant, arrived in Avanti with two beautiful courtesan daughters.
On the highway

Abhayakumar's liberation, binding Chandrapradyot and bringing him back
Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 114. He had rented a house nearby. While passing that way, Chandrapradyot saw those two courtesans one day.
From the point of view of pleasure, Chandrapradyot looked at them. As a result, Chandrapradyot became infatuated with them. Upon reaching the palace, Chandrapradyot sent a messenger to the two courtesans to seek their consent for union. But they rejected the messenger's proposal. The next day, the messenger again came and requested the king for union. Even then, the two of them, in anger, showed some disrespect. On the third day, the messenger pleaded with them again. Then the two of them said, "Our virtuous brother is our protector. He will go to another village on the seventh day from today. If the king comes here secretly then, union can happen." The messenger went and told Chandrapradyot everything. After the messenger left, Abhayakumar made a man who looked like Chandrapradyot mad and named him Chandrapradyot too. Then Abhayakumar started telling people, "Hey! My brother doesn't let me sit peacefully. He makes me wander here and there. I am responsible for his protection. I don't understand how to protect him." Abhayakumar used to put him to sleep on a cot every day and take him out, as if he was suffering from a disease and he was taking him to a physician. Now, when that madman was taken from the crossroads, he would shout loudly, shed tears and cry, "Hey, I am Chandrapradyot, these people are kidnapping me!" Exactly on the seventh day, the lustful Chandrapradyot, the king, came alone, like an elephant. As per the prior arrangement, Abhayakumar's men bound him. Then, saying, "I am taking him to the physician," Abhayakumar, with the cot, kidnapped King Chandrapradyot in broad daylight, while shouting. He placed Chandrapradyot in a chariot, which was already prepared with swift horses, and the fearless Abhayakumar took him straight to the royal palace. Then he presented King Chandrapradyot before King Shrenik. King Shrenik drew his sword and ran to kill him, but Abhayakumar intervened and stopped him from doing so. Afterwards, he honored him, gave him clothes and ornaments, and released King Chandrapradyot with joy.
Once, a woodcutter, disgusted with the world, took initiation from the brilliant Ganadhar Shri Sudharmaswami. But when he wandered in the city, the city dwellers, remembering his former state, made fun of him everywhere and criticized him. Disturbed by this, he said to Sudharmaswami, "Gurudev! I am unable to bear the humiliation by staying here. Therefore, I want to wander elsewhere." Due to this, Sudharmaswami was also preparing to wander elsewhere. When Abhayakumar saw this, he asked Ganadhar Maharaj the reason for wandering elsewhere. He simply told him the reason for his wandering elsewhere. Abhayakumar bowed to Ganadhar Maharaj and humbly requested, "Lord! Please grace us by staying here for one more day. After that, do as you deem fit." Abhayakumar had three heaps of jewels worth one crore each taken out from the state treasury and placed them in the public market where there was a lot of traffic, and he had an announcement made in the city, "Citizens! Listen; I (Abhayakumar) am going to donate these three heaps of jewels. Hearing this, the city dwellers gathered at the scene. Addressing that crowd, Abhayakumar said, "People! Whoever among you will renounce water, fire and women for life, will be given these three heaps of jewels. Speak, is anyone ready to make such a renunciation?" The people present said, "Minister! It is very difficult for us to make such a lifelong renunciation. Only a few can make such a transcendental renunciation." To this, Abhayakumar rebuked them, "If none of you can make such a renunciation, then should the three crore worth jewels be given to the woodcutter who has renounced water, fire and women for life and has become a great sage? Such a renunciant sage is worthy of this donation. But we people are such that..."

The initiation of fearlessness, the praise of contentment, the removal of disbelief towards the Muni.

Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 115: The renunciant sadhus are mocked in vain. What right do we have to insult such a renunciant, when we ourselves are incapable of such renunciation? We should apologize to them. In the future, we should never despise, disregard, or ridicule them or any other sadhu. Thus, at the request of Abhaykumar, the people pledged their word and went to their respective places.

In this way, Abhaykumar, the ocean of wisdom, devoted to his father, detached, and devoted to dharma, ruled his father's kingdom in a well-organized manner. Only one who practices dharma himself can make others practice dharma. The nature of the people and animals is subject to the leader and the animal keeper. On the one hand, just as Abhaykumar relieved the king by taking on the burden of state affairs, on the other hand, he also became a steadfast mind by accepting the twelve vows of Shravak dharma. Just as he conquered the powerful enemies outside, he also conquered the internal enemies, obstacles in both worlds.

One day, King Shrenik said to him, "My son! Now you take care of this kingdom, so that I can serve the glorious Veer Paramatma with a peaceful mind." Abhaykumar, fearful of disobeying his father's command and also of worldly wandering, said, "Father! Your command is beautiful, but please wait a while." At that time, Lord Mahavira was also returning to Rajgriha from the desert, after initiating King Udayan. Abhaykumar went to his feet and bowed.

He asked the omniscient Tirthankara, "Lord! Who will be the last Rajarshi in your presence?" In reply, the Lord said, "Consider Udayan to be the last Rajarshi." Abhaykumar immediately went to King Shrenik and said, "Father! If I become king, then I will not be able to become a Rishi; because Veer Prabhu has declared Udayan to be the last Rajarshi. And having found a master like Veer Prabhu and a righteous father like you, if I do not cut off the sorrows of the world, then who else will be more wicked and insane than me? Therefore, father, I am called Abhay, but I am extremely afraid of the world. Therefore, please give me permission so that I can become completely fearless by taking refuge in the glorious Veer Prabhu, who gives fearlessness to the three worlds. What benefit do I have from this kingdom, which is a source of pride and attachment to worldly pleasures? Because the great sages find happiness not in desire, but in contentment."

When Abhaykumar was not eager to accept the kingdom, even after repeated requests from King Shrenik, the king, being helpless, readily gave his permission to take initiation. Abhaykumar, who desired the happiness of contentment, renounced the kingdom as if it were a straw and, with a spirit of detachment, accepted initiation at the lotus feet of the supreme Tirthankara Mahavira. The benevolent, contentment-bearing Shri Abhaykumar Muni, after completing his lifespan, went to the Devaloka called Sarvarth Siddha. Thus, any other person who takes refuge in the happiness of contentment also attains increasing happiness, like Abhaykumar. This is the life story of Abhaykumar, the devotee of contentment. ||114||

Now, the prevalent topic is the praise of contentment. ||171||

"Sanni dhau nidhayas tasya, kaama gavy anugaamini. Amaraa kinkaraayante, santosho yasya bhooshanam." ||115||

Meaning: He who has the ornament of contentment, understand that the nine treasures, including Padma, are in his hands; the Kamadhenu cow follows him, and the gods serve him as servants. ||115||

Explanation: The Muni, who is a devotee of contentment, can drop a heap of jewels from the tip of a straw due to the influence of calmness. They are capable of giving fruits according to their wishes, and the gods are eager to serve them in competition. There is no doubt about it.

Here we present the meaning of some verses related to contentment: 1. Wealth, 2. Grain, 3. Gold, 4. Silver, 5. Other metals, 6. Fields, 7. Houses, 8. Bipeds, 9. Quadrupeds; these are nine types of external possessions. 1. Attachment, 2. Aversion, 3. Other stories mention taking initiation without asking.

## The Glory of Contentment

**Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 115**

**6. Four Kashayas, 7. Sorrow, 8. Laughter, 9. Fear, 10. Attraction, 11. Repulsion, 12. Disgust, 13. Three Vedas, and 14. Falsehood - these are the fourteen types of internal attachments.** Just as during the rainy season, rats and mad dogs become troublesome due to the influence of poison, similarly, external attachments often increase internal attachments like Kashayas. The great wind of attachment, like a powerful storm, can uproot even the strongest tree of detachment with deep roots. One who desires liberation while riding the chariot of attachment is truly like someone hoping to cross the ocean in an iron boat. Just as fire born from fuel destroys wood, external attachments destroy a man's patience. How can a weak person conquer the army of internal attachments when he cannot control the external attachments? Attachment alone is the garden where ignorance plays, the ocean filled with the water of sorrow, and the unique root of the great vine of craving. It is astonishing that those who are eager to protect their wealth are suspicious even of the renunciant who has renounced all relationships. The wealthy man, anxious about the fear of the king (government), thieves, family, fire, water, etc., cannot sleep at night. Whether in times of famine or prosperity, in the forest or in the city, the wealthy man, always filled with doubt and fear, remains perpetually unhappy. The poor man, whether innocent or guilty, sleeps peacefully, free from all these worries, but the wealthy man suffers due to the vices born in the world. Whether in earning wealth, protecting it, spending it, or losing it, wealth always brings sorrow to man. Like a bear dancing with its ears held, wealth makes man dance. Curse such wealth! Just as dogs fight with each other for a piece of meat, wealthy people fight with their own relatives or suffer pain. Even when caught in the jaws of Yama, the wealthy man does not give up his desires to earn wealth, keep it, and increase it. Like a demon, this wealth-destroying force shows man various ironies until he leaves his body. If you desire the kingdom of happiness, righteousness, and liberation, then renounce all things other than the soul and control your craving for hope. Hope is a heavy obstacle, impenetrable by thunderbolts, that blocks entry into the city of heaven and liberation. Hope is demonic for humans. It is a poisonous mixture, old wine. Curse hope, the producer of all vices! Blessed are they, virtuous are they, and they alone cross the ocean of the world who have subdued the serpent of hope that enchants the world. Only those who have renounced hope-craving, the mine of sorrow like a poisonous vine, the mother of many vices like a fire that destroys happiness, can live happily in the world. The glory of the fire of craving is truly extraordinary, for it immediately extinguishes the state of meditation, like a cloud of righteousness. A man under the control of the demon of craving speaks humbly before the wealthy, sings songs, dances, shows off, and feels no shame in doing any shameful act. In fact, he does such things even more. Where even the wind cannot reach, where the rays of the sun and moon cannot penetrate, there the great waves of hope reach unimpeded. A man who falls under the sway of hope becomes its slave. But he who subdues hope makes hope his servant. Hope does not decrease or increase with a person's age. As a man grows old, his hope-craving does not grow old. Craving is so destructive that no one can attain happiness while it exists. A man's body grows old, his skin shrinks like leather, his black hair turns white, and the garland he wears becomes loose. Even when the body's appearance changes, hope is not satisfied. The object that hope has abandoned becomes greater than the object obtained. The object that a man desires to obtain with great effort becomes, 1. In other places, Raga-Dvesha (attachment-aversion) is included in Kashayas, and the three Vedas are counted as three types of attachments.

## The Glory of Contentment

**Yoga Shastra, Second Light, Verse 115**

He who renounces hope easily attains liberation. Whether one's punya (merit) awakens or not, clinging to the demon of hope is futile. He who has abandoned hope and desire and embraced contentment is truly learned, wise, intelligent, knowledgeable, virtuous, and a devotee of austerity. The happiness enjoyed by those who are satiated with the nectar of contentment is not attainable by the dissatisfied, who are dependent on others and run around in pursuit of wealth. Those who wear the armor of contentment are unaffected by the arrows of desire. "How can I stop this desire?" Do not be troubled by such anxieties. In a nutshell, I can say this in one sentence: "He whose demon of desire has been pacified has attained the supreme state."

Those who renounce the bondage of hope, reduce their possessions, engage their intellect in virtuous conduct, and become devoted to the path of virtue, thereby attaining the state of spiritual purity, are considered exceptional individuals. And those who, renouncing false beliefs and embracing right faith, practice the path of the Shravaka (lay follower) with limited possessions, are even more exceptional. The speed attained by those who practice other paths with limited possessions is effortlessly achieved by the devotee of the Shravaka path, like the moon. A non-Jain who fasts for months and breaks his fast with a morsel of food as small as a dot on the tip of a blade of grass cannot compare to the sixteenth part of the excellence of a Shravaka who is content. Even those who perform extraordinary austerities, like the Tamalita Tapas (austerity of the Tamal tree) or the Purna Tapas (complete austerity), attain a lower state than the Shravaka who is worthy of liberation. Therefore, O awakened one, do not let the demon of desire drive you mad. Reduce your possessions, embrace contentment, and have faith in the excellence of the path of the Yati (ascetic), so that you may attain liberation in seven or eight lifetimes.

**Thus ends the Second Light of the Yoga Shastra, titled Adhyotma Upanishad, composed by Acharya Shri Hemchandrasuri, which was compiled at the request of King Shri Kumarapala.**

|| Om Arhate Namah ||
3. Third Light:
Discussion of Gunavratas:
After discussing Anuvratas in detail, now we have the opportunity to explain Gunavratas. First, we will explain the nature of the first Gunavrata.
|| 172 || Dasasvapi krta dikshu, yatra seema na langhyate. Khyatam digviratiriti pratham tat gunavratam ||1||
The vow in which the boundary (limit) set for going and coming in all ten directions is not violated; that is called the first Gunavrata, known as Digvirati. ||1||
Meaning:
Explanation: East, Southeast, South, Southwest, West, Northwest, North, Northeast, Upward and Downward are the ten directions. To set a limit for going and coming in these directions and to accept rules accordingly; this is the first Gunavrata. It is also called Gunavrata because it is in the form of Uttaraguna. Or, because it is beneficial (helpful) in protecting Anuvratas, it is the famous Gunavrata called Digvirati. ||1||
Here the question arises that Anuvratas are said to be in the form of cessation from sins like violence, etc.; this is fine; but in Digvirati, from which sin is there cessation, which makes it a vow? In answer to this, it is said - in this vow too, there is cessation from sins like violence, etc. This is explained further.
|| 173 || Chara charaananam jeevaananam vimardanani vartanaat. Tapta ayogola kalpasya, sadvratam grihino api adah ||2||
Meaning: By limiting the area in all four directions, there is cessation from the destruction of movable and immovable beings in the form of violence, etc. Therefore, this vow is considered auspicious even for a householder, who is like a heated iron ball. ||2||
Explanation: Char means two-sense beings, etc., and Achar means one-sense beings, etc., immovable beings. By going and coming outside the limited boundary in different directions, there is violence towards the movable and immovable beings living there; but by this Gunavrata, by setting a limit for going and coming in the said ten directions, one becomes completely free from violence towards the beings living outside. By cessation from violence, the prohibition of violence is achieved. For this reason, this is a good vow for a householder. Cessation from other sins like falsehood, etc., also occurs, similar to the prohibition of violence. Here there is a doubt that in this way, the need for setting a limit on directions will also arise for a monk; in answer to this, it is said; this is not correct. A monk is completely free from initial possessions, a householder is bound by initial possessions, so he will go, come, sit, stand, eat, drink, sleep, or do any work; there he will commit violence towards beings like a heated iron ball. Therefore, it is said - wherever a heated iron ball goes, it will not remain without burning beings; similarly, a careless and Gunavrata-less householder can also commit sins everywhere like a heated iron ball. But a monk is endowed with samiti-gupti and is a Mahavrata-holder; therefore, he is not affected by this defect of a heated iron ball. Therefore, he does not need to take the Digvirati vow. ||2||
In addition to this, this vow is also for cessation from the sin of greed. This is stated in the next verse.
|| 174 || Jagda kramanamanasya, prasaral lobha varidheh. Skhalanam vidadhe tena, yena digvirati krta ||3||

## The Characteristics, Nature, and Types of Bhogopabhoga Parimaan

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verses 3 to 7:**

**Verse 3:** The person who has accepted the Digvirati (direction-limitation) vow has stopped the vast ocean of greed that spreads, attacking the entire world.

**Explanation:** The person who has accepted the Digvirati vow, meaning the one who has voluntarily restricted themselves from going beyond a certain limit, naturally does not have much greed for gold, silver, wealth, grain, etc., that lie outside their limited area. Otherwise, a person under the influence of greed desires the wealth of the gods in the upper world, the wealth of the Chakravarti (universal monarch) and others in the middle world, and the wealth of the Naga Kumaras (serpent princes) and other gods in the lower world. They keep making plans to acquire wealth from all three worlds and find false satisfaction in their minds. Therefore, greed is described as attacking all three worlds. It is compared to the ocean. Just as the ocean is turbulent and frightening with many waves, the ocean of greed is also full of many waves of options, and it is very difficult to fathom. Thus, the Digvirati vow stops the growing greed.

**Internal Verses:**

This vow is for life for the Anuvrati Sadgrihastha (householder who observes minor vows), and it is also taken for at least four months. For those who constantly remain in Samayik (a Jain ritual), who control their minds, who have conquered their senses, or for Sadhus and Sadhvis (Jain monks and nuns), there is no restriction or non-restriction in movement in any direction. Charanmuni (a type of Jain monk) performs actions like walking even on the peak of Mount Meru in the upward direction and on Mount Ruchik in the diagonal direction. Therefore, the Digvirati vow does not apply to them. Those who are wise and set limits on their movement in every direction become the owners of immense wealth in heaven and other realms.

**Now, regarding the second Gunavrata (vow of conduct):**

**Verse 4:** The second Gunavrata, called Bhogopabhoga Parimaan, is the vow where one sets a limit on the number of enjoyable and consumable things according to their physical and mental strength.

**Explanation:** Now, the nature of Bhoga (enjoyment) and Upabhoga (consumption) is explained.

**Verse 5:** The thing that is enjoyed only once is called Bhoga, such as food, water, flowers, garlands, betel nut, ointments, body scrubs, incense, chewing, bathing, etc. And that which can be enjoyed repeatedly is called Upabhoga, such as women, clothes, ornaments, houses, beds, seats, vehicles, etc. This Bhogopabhoga Parimaan vow is of two types: the first is by setting a limit on the things that can be enjoyed, and the second is by abandoning non-edible things.

**This is presented in the following two verses:**

**Verse 6:** One should avoid alcohol, meat, butter, honey, five types of Udumbar (fig) fruits, fruits of unknown origin, and food eaten at night.

**Verse 7:** One should avoid raw buttermilk mixed with mung beans, chickpeas, black gram, and moth beans, split pulses, rice cooked with flowers, and curd that has been kept for more than a day, as well as cooked food.

**Explanation:** Alcohol is of two types: one is in the form of juice from palm trees, etc., and the other is made by fermenting flour, jaggery, etc., which is called liquor. Meat is also of three types, based on the distinction between aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial creatures. Along with meat, one should also understand the skin, bones, fat, and blood associated with it. Butter is made from the milk of cows, buffaloes, goats, and sheep, so there are four types of butter. Honey is of three types: from bees, bumblebees, and wasps. Udumbar (fig) and five other types of fruits with infinite seeds, fruits of unknown origin, food eaten at night, raw buttermilk mixed with mung beans, chickpeas, black gram, and moth beans, split pulses, rice cooked with flowers, and curd that has been kept for more than a day, as well as cooked food, should all be avoided.

##  Harm from Alcohol

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 817**

**6-7.**  Give up the consumption of all these:  split lentils (dal), moss (fulan), rice that has fallen, yogurt that is two days old, stale food.

**179.** Now, the harmful effects (faults) of alcohol are presented in ten verses.

**8.**  Just as a clever man, due to misfortune, abandons a woman from afar, so too, a wise man loses his intelligence upon merely drinking alcohol.

**And hear more:**

**9.**  Due to the mind being overpowered by drinking alcohol, the sinful drunkard, losing his senses, behaves towards his mother like a wife, and towards his wife like a mother.

**10.**  A person with a disturbed (restless) mind, due to drinking alcohol, cannot recognize his own or others.  He, the unfortunate one, treats his servant as his master and his master as his servant.  He becomes pitiful due to being unconscious.

**11.**  When a drunkard, like a corpse, lies on the street, dogs urinate in his open mouth, fearing a pit.

**12.**  Immersed in the taste of alcohol, the drunkard sleeps naked in the marketplace, and carelessly reveals his secret thoughts, or treason, etc., which should be kept secret.

**13.**  Just as applying kajal on beautifully drawn pictures destroys them, so too, drinking alcohol destroys a person's beauty, fame, intelligence, talent, and wealth.

**14.**  The drinker of alcohol dances and jumps like a possessed person, cries loudly like one mourning the dead, and rolls and writhes like a person suffering from a burning fever.

**15.**  Like the poison Halahala, alcohol makes the drinker's limbs weak, weakens the senses, and causes a severe fainting spell.

**16.**  Discrimination, self-control, knowledge, truthfulness, purity of conduct, compassion, and forgiveness - all these virtues are destroyed by alcohol, like a large pile of grass being consumed by a single spark of fire.

## The Evils and Irony of Alcohol and Meat

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verses 17-19**

**Verse 17:**

* **Text:**  "Madyaṁ doṣāṇāṁ kāraṇaṁ, madyaṁ kāraṇam āpadām | Rogātūra ivāpathyaṁ, tasmān madyaṁ vivarjayet ||17||"
* **Meaning:** Just as it is essential for a sick person to abstain from harmful food, so too is it essential to completely abandon alcohol, which is harmful to life, as it is the cause of many vices like theft, adultery, and the source of many calamities like killing, imprisonment, etc.

**Explanation:** What evil deed does a person not commit after drinking alcohol? A drunkard can commit all kinds of misdeeds like theft, adultery, hunting, robbery, murder, etc. There is no evil deed from which he can refrain. Therefore, it is right to completely abandon alcohol, the mother of all evils, from afar.

**Verse 18:**

* **Text:** "Cikhādiṣati yo māṁsaṁ, prāṇi prāṇāpahārataḥ | Unmūlayatyasau mūlaṁ, dayākhyaṁ dharmaśākhinaḥ ||18||"
* **Meaning:** It is not possible to obtain meat without killing living beings. And the person who desires to eat such meat, uproots the root of compassion, which is the branch of Dharma.

**Verse 19:**

* **Text:** "Aśanīyan saṁ sadā māṁsaṁ, dayāṁ yo hi cikiṣati | Jvalati jvalane vallīṁ, sa ropayitu micchati ||19||"
* **Meaning:**  To those who say that even meat-eaters can be compassionate, we explain: It is like wanting to plant a vine in a burning fire.

## The Evils of Meat-Eating

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verses 20-24**

**Meaning:**  He who desires to be merciful while constantly eating meat, is like one who wants to plant a vine in a burning fire. It is difficult for such meat-eaters to have mercy in their hearts. ||19||

**Explanation:** Here, a doubt is raised: killing a creature is one thing, and eating meat is another. How can a meat-eater be blamed for the sin of taking a creature's life? In response, it is said: "The eater is also a killer (violent), this is supported by... ||191||

**Meaning:** The one who kills with a weapon, the one who sells meat, the one who cooks meat, the one who eats meat, the one who buys meat, the one who approves of it, and the one who gives or hosts meat, all these are directly or indirectly (through tradition) killers (violent) of living beings. ||20||

Manu has said the same thing in the 51st verse of the fifth chapter of Manusmriti.

**Meaning:** The one who approves of eating meat, the one who kills the creature, the one who dismembers it, the one who buys and sells meat, the one who cooks it, the one who serves it, or the one who offers it as a gift and the one who eats it, all these are of the same category of killers (violent). ||21||

In the 48th verse of the same Smriti, it is said:

**Meaning:** Meat is not obtained or produced anywhere without killing living beings, and killing living beings, being a cause of great suffering to them, does not lead to heaven, but rather to the suffering of hell. Thinking this way, one should completely abandon meat. ||22||

**Meaning:** Those who nourish their own flesh by eating the flesh of others are truly violent, for without the eater, there would be no killer. ||23||

**Explanation:** Without meat-eaters, there would be no killing of animals, etc. Therefore, the meat-eater is the greater sinner. The one who nourishes their own flesh (body) by eating the flesh of others, the one who satisfies their tongue with meat, the one who sustains their momentary life on meat, takes the lives of many other creatures. It is said: "He who makes himself alive by killing other creatures destroys his own soul in a short time. And for his own short life, he becomes a participant in the suffering of many groups of creatures. Does he understand that his life will be eternal?" ||22-23||

This is said with condemnation:

**Meaning:** Even delicious food, like rice, mung beans, lentils, and wheat, ultimately become excrement, and even milk and other nectar-like drinks become urine. Therefore, for this impure (dirty, disgusting) body, who would be a wise human being who would commit sins like violence? ||24||

Manusmriti and others describe the faults of meat-eating and the miserable condition of meat-eaters. The Yogashastra, in verses 25-29 of the third chapter, refutes those who say that there is no fault in meat-consumption.

25. Those wicked people who say, "There is no fault in meat-eating," have probably taken the hunter, vulture, wolf, tiger, and jackal as their gurus.

26. Manu has also explained the etymology of the word "mansa" (meat) - "maa" means me, and "sa" means that which will eat me in the next birth; this is the true nature of meat.

27. The intellect of a person greedy for the taste of meat turns towards killing other living beings, just like the intellect of a Shakini (a type of witch).

28. Even though divine eatables are available, they eat flesh, abandoning the nectar-like substances, and consume the deadly poison.

29. The merciless one has no dharma, and how can the greedy one have compassion? The meat-greedy one does not know this, nor should one teach him.

The worship of devas and pitrs (ancestors) with meat is also adharma (unrighteousness).

Explanation from Yogashastra, Trutiya Prakash, Shloka 30-31: A cruel person has no dharma (righteousness). How can a meat-eater have compassion? Because a person who is greedy for meat does not even know dharma. And if he knows, he does not preach that kind of dharma.

The root of dharma is daya (compassion). Therefore, dharma cannot exist without daya. The jiva (living being) who eats meat commits himsa (violence), hence does not have daya. Therefore, the defect of adharmatva (unrighteousness) applies to him. The question arises - how can a conscious person tolerate the absence of dharma in his atma (soul)? In response, it is said that the meat-loving person has no awareness of daya or dharma. Even if he has knowledge of this, he cannot give up meat. He thinks that everyone is like him, a meat-eater, and like an ajinaka (one who spreads his own habit to others), he cannot preach meat-renunciation to others. 

It is heard that a traveler named Ajinaka was going somewhere when suddenly a serpent bit him. He thought that it should also bite others like him, so he did not tell any other traveler about the serpent on the path. As a result, the other unaware travelers were also bitten by the same serpent. Similarly, a meat-eater not only goes to hell himself due to the sin of meat-eating, but also takes others to hell. "The wicked one destroys himself and also destroys others." From this perspective, he does not stop others from meat-eating by preaching.

Now, the foolishness of meat-eaters is described. Some people, out of great delusion, eat meat themselves, and not only that, they also offer or dedicate meat to devas, pitrs, and guests, because their authoritative scriptures (Manusmriti, Chapter 5, Verse 32) have declared it as dharma. They cite this as evidence.

Having purchased meat themselves, or having produced it by killing a living being, or having received it as a gift from others, and then worshiping devas and pitrs with that meat, and later consuming that meat, the person is not tainted by the sin of meat-eating.

This statement is full of ignorance! We have already refuted and explained that eating meat produced by the slaughter of animals is improper. Then, how can offering it to the deities be even more improper? Because the deities have attained a pure, non-material, vaikriya (transformed) body due to their past merits, they are not flesh-eaters. So, how can they consume meat? What is the use of offering meat to those who do not eat it? This is mere ignorance. The ancestors (pitrs) and others attain their respective destinations according to their own merits or demerits, and they cannot be uplifted by the merits of their descendants. Just as watering a mango tree cannot make the coconut tree bear fruit. Offering meat, which is the cause of taking the honored guests or ancestors to hell, is a great adharma (unrighteousness) for both them and oneself. Such a tendency is filled with great delusion. 

Someone may argue that since the scriptures (shrutis or smritis) have prescribed this (meat-eating), one should not doubt it or refute it. This argument is also invalid.

There is no similarity between meat-eating and non-meat eating, butter is a sin.

The third light of Yoga Shastra, verses 32 to 33, refute this by saying - How can one have faith in unauthentic scriptures? In which scriptures it is said that 'touching a cow destroys sin; cutting down trees and worshipping them, killing goats, birds, etc. animals, leads to heaven. Feeding a Brahmin satisfies the ancestors; deceitful gods are also liberated, offerings made in fire are pleasing to the gods. How can a wise man believe in such inconsistent laws or scriptures? It is also said - touching a cow that eats dung destroys sins, an ignorant tree is worthy of worship, killing a goat leads to heaven, feeding a Brahmin satisfies the ancestors, deceitful gods are considered liberated, offerings made in fire reach the gods; etc. From such statements, what kind of play is being made of the essence of the scriptures? Therefore, the law in the so-called scriptures about worshipping gods with meat, etc. is full of ignorance. Let's understand it briefly. What is the benefit of saying it in detail? ||31||

One may doubt that fire does not burn or cook after being consecrated by mantras, and that meat also does not become sinful after being consecrated by mantras. Manu has said that one who has faith in the eternal Vedic law should not eat any kind of animal flesh without being consecrated by mantras, but should eat meat consecrated by mantras. (Manu Smriti 5/23) This is refuted. 203. Even if it is consecrated by mantras, even a little bit of meat is not good. Even a drop of Halahala poison destroys life. ||32|| _ Meaning: Even after being consecrated by mantras, one should not eat even as much meat as a barley grain. Because even a drop of Halahala poison destroys life. ||33|| _ Explanation: Even if meat is purified by mantras, it is not fit to eat even as much as a barley grain. Just as mantras cannot stop the power of fire to burn, similarly meat (even if consecrated by mantras) cannot stop the power of attaining hell, etc. If this (destruction of sin by mantras) happens, then any person can commit all kinds of heinous sins and get rid of them by repeatedly chanting the so-called sin-destroying mantras; he will be fulfilled. If all sins are destroyed by mantras, then it is useless to prohibit sins. Therefore, just as a little bit of alcohol makes one drunk, similarly, even a little bit of meat leads to the bondage of sin. Therefore, it is said - even a few drops of poison destroy life, similarly, even as much meat as a barley grain leads to hell. ||32||

Now, concluding by telling the great sins caused by meat. 204. Immediately after killing a living being, countless unconscious living beings are born in it, and the tradition of their repeated birth continues. The scriptures say - 'Unconscious living beings of the Nigoda type are constantly born in raw or cooked meat, or in the muscles while cooking. Therefore, meat contaminated by so much animal cruelty is the food (food) of the path of hell. Therefore, what wise person can eat meat? ||33|| Explanation: Some useful verses related to this are presented - He who talks about eating meat has abandoned the limits, is ignorant, atheist, a writer of bad scriptures, greedy for meat or stubborn. There is no one more shameless than him who wants to nourish his body with the flesh of others, which is the fuel for the fire of hell. The pig of the house is good, which nourishes its body by eating the dung that humans throw away, but the man who increases his limbs by eating the flesh of others by killing animals is not good. I doubt about those who say that the flesh of all living beings except humans is edible. There is no one more irreligious than the one who does not see any difference between human flesh and animal flesh.

Honey produced from violence, i.e., honey collected from beehives, is also to be discarded, as it is the excreta of bees.
According to Yoga Shastra, the third light, verses 34 to 37, there is no greater sinner than one who eats the flesh of animals.  Born from the semen of a male and the blood (menstrual fluid) of a female, nourished by the juice of excrement, who but a worm can eat flesh that is coagulated blood?  It is astonishing that the twice-born Brahmins preach the religion of purity, yet they eat flesh, which is born of seven impurities (tissues) and is unclean.  For those who consider the flesh of grass-eating animals to be the same as grain, poison that brings death and nectar that gives life are both equal.  Those who are ignorant and have a dull soul believe that just as rice is a part of a one-sensed being, so too is flesh a part of a living being, and therefore, good men should eat flesh like rice.  Then why do they not drink the urine of a cow, which is like the milk produced by the cow?  Rice, etc., do not contain flesh, blood, fat, etc., which are inedible substances, whereas flesh contains all these inedible substances.  Therefore, rice, etc., are edible, while flesh, etc., are inedible.  Just as a holy conch shell and the bone of a living being are not considered the same, so too are rice, etc., not considered inedible.  The sinner who says that all limbs are the same, and therefore considers flesh and rice to be the same, why does he not think that all women are the same, and therefore treat his mother and wife equally?  Just as it is said that going to hell is the result of killing even one five-sensed being or eating its flesh, it is not said that going to hell is the result of eating grain, etc. (one-sensed).  Flesh, which corrupts the juice and blood, cannot be food.  Therefore, one who does not eat flesh and is a grain eater cannot be a sinner.  The killing of one-sensed beings occurs in the cooking of grain, which is not so much of an obstacle in the vow of country-renunciation.  Even householders who are lovers of the high Jain religion, who are content with grain food, considering the conduct of meat-eaters, obtain high-level divine wealth.  ||33||
Now, in passing, we will point out the fault in eating ghee (butter).  ||205||  After the end of the internal muhurta, a multitude of extremely subtle beings are born in it.  Wise men should not eat ghee where they faint.  ||34||  Meaning:  Wise men should not eat ghee where a multitude of extremely subtle beings are born in it after the end of the internal muhurta.  ||34||  We consider this point.  ||206||  What is the sin in killing even one living being?  It is difficult to say.  Then who can consume ghee, which is made up of the bodies of many beings?  ||35||  Meaning:  What is the sin in killing even one living being?  It is difficult to say.  Then who can consume ghee, which is made up of the bodies of many beings?  ||35||  Now, we will point out the fault in eating honey.  ||207||  Who, being wise, will lick honey, which is born from the destruction of a multitude of beings, and is as disgusting as saliva dripping from the mouth?  ||36||  Meaning:  Who, being wise, will lick honey, which is born from the destruction of a multitude of beings, and is as disgusting as saliva dripping from the mouth?  By implication, here we should also understand the honey of bumblebees, etc.  ||36||  Now, we will condemn the honey-eater.  ||208||  One who eats honey, which is born from the destruction of millions of tiny beings, is more sinful than a butcher who kills a few animals.  ||37||  Meaning:  Beings that do not have bones are called tiny beings, or even insignificant beings are considered tiny.  One who eats honey, which is born from the destruction of millions of tiny beings (due to smoking), is more sinful than a butcher who kills a few animals.  The eater is also deadly like the producer, this has been said before.  ||37||  False food is to be discarded, this is also said in worldly scriptures.  From this point of view, honey is also to be discarded like excrement, as it is the excreta of bees.  This is what is being said.  ||197||

Description of Udumbara, Anantakaaya, etc.
Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verses 30 to 43. 209.  Bees, sitting on each flower, drink its nectar and vomit it. The righteous do not eat that vomited honey. 38. Meaning: Bees sit on each flower, drink its nectar, and vomit it. The righteous do not eat that vomited honey (honey). Even in worldly practice, only pure food is considered fit for consumption by the righteous. 38. Here, a doubt is raised: Honey calms the three doshas. There is no better medicine than this for disease prevention. Then what is the fault in its consumption? In response to this, it is said. 210. Even if taken as medicine, honey is a bond to hell. Even a small particle of poison, if eaten by mistake or out of a desire to live, is fatal. 39. Meaning: Forget about the desire for taste, even taking honey as medicine for disease prevention is a cause of falling into the abyss of hell. Because even a small particle of poison, if eaten by mistake or out of a desire to live, is fatal. 39. Here, another question is raised: Like the juice of dates, raisins, etc., honey is sweet, delicious, and pleasing to all the senses. Why should it be abandoned? In response to this, it is said. 211. The sweetness of honey is said to be ignorance. Those who taste it experience hellish torment for a long time. 40. Meaning: It is true that honey seems sweet in worldly experience. But from the transcendental point of view, it is extremely bitter because it is the cause of hellish torment. It is unfortunate that ignorant people, unaware of the transcendental truth, call bitter honey sweet in the end. Those who taste honey have to suffer hellish torment for a long time. 40. Those who believe that honey is pure and therefore useful for the anointing of gods are ridiculed. 212. Honey, vomited from the mouth of a bee, born from the killing of creatures. Oh! Those who consider it pure, use it for the anointing of gods like Shankar. 41. Meaning: Oh! It is amazing that people who consider honey, vomited from the mouth of a bee and born from the killing of many creatures, to be pure, use it for the anointing of gods like Shankar. Brother! This is like a donkey becoming a musician at the wedding of camels and praising the appearance of the camel, and the camel praising the voice of the donkey! In this way, both praise each other, just like the above statement. 41. Now, the five faults of consuming Udumbara are explained in order. 213. The fruits of Udumbara, Vat, Plaksha, Kakodumbara, and Pipal are full of countless creatures. Therefore, all these five Udumbara fruits are to be abandoned. 42. Meaning: The word Udumbara should be understood to refer to all five types of trees: Gulal, Bada, Pipal (Plaksha), Pars Pipal, Kathumar, Lakshpipal (Lac). The fruits of all these five types of trees should not be eaten; because there are so many insects in one fruit that they cannot be counted. Even in worldly scriptures, it is said: 'There are countless creatures living in the fruit of Udumbara, and it is not known how or from where they enter? It is also difficult to say whether these creatures die when the fruit is cut, broken into pieces, crushed, ground, or even filtered or separated!' Now, those who follow the rule of abandoning all five Udumbara fruits are praised. 42. 214) Even if a virtuous soul, a devotee of vows, is in a country and time where there is an abundance of easily available grains and fruits, he does not eat the fruit of the five Udumbara trees out of virtue. 43. Meaning: A virtuous soul, a devotee of vows, who is in a country and time where there is an abundance of easily available grains and fruits, does not eat the fruit of the five Udumbara trees out of virtue. 43.

## Nighttime Meal Doshas

**From Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verses 44-48**

**Verse 43:** Even in times of famine, when food, fruits, etc. are scarce and one is extremely hungry, and the body is becoming emaciated, one should not eat the five-pointed fruit. Those who do so are commendable.

**Verses 44-46:** Now, regarding the infinite-bodied beings, three verses are spoken:

* **Verse 44:** All moist tubers, all new shoots, the bark of the *Snuhī* (Euphorbia neriifolia) and *Lavaṇa* (salt) trees, *Kumārī* (Aloe vera), *Girikaṇṇikā* (a type of creeper), *Śatāvarī* (Asparagus racemosus), sprouted sprouts, *Guḍūcī* (Tinospora cordifolia), tender tamarind, *Palyanka* (spinach), *Amṛtavallī* (a type of creeper), and the hair of the boar.
* **Verse 45:** These are mentioned as infinite-bodied beings in the scriptures. There are others as well, which the wrong-sighted are unaware of. These should be avoided with effort by the compassionate devotees.
* **Verse 46:** **Meaning:** All types of tubers do not become infinite-bodied beings because they become lifeless when they dry up. The usual meaning of tuber is the part of the tree that remains in the ground below the trunk. All green tubers are infinite-bodied beings. Some names are mentioned here: *Sūraṇa* (yam), *Adaraka* (ginger), *Haladī* (turmeric), *Vajrakanda* (a type of tuber), *Lahsun* (garlic), *Naraka-cūra* (a type of tuber), *Kamalakanda* (lotus root), *Hastikanda* (elephant yam), *Manuṣyakanda* (a type of tuber), *Gājar* (carrot), *Padminīkanda* (a type of tuber), *Kaserū* (a type of tuber), *Mogrī* (a type of tuber), *Mūthā* (a type of tuber), *Ālū* (potato), *Pyāz* (onion), *Ratālu* (sweet potato), etc. By *kiśalaya* (new shoot) is meant the tender leaves of every plant and the first sprout that emerges from the seed; all these are infinite-bodied beings. Only the bark of the *Thūhara* or *Lavaṇa* tree is infinite-bodied; its other parts are not. *Kumārīpāṭhā* (a type of creeper), *Aparājita* (a type of creeper), the medicinal *Śatāvarī*, sprouted grains like chickpeas and mung beans, every kind of *Guḍūcī* (Tinospora cordifolia) that grows on trees like neem and is especially used for medicine, tender tamarind, spinach, *Amṛtavallī* (a type of creeper), boar hair (a type of large creeper found in the forest from which *Varahakanda* (a type of tuber) emerges) (the word *śūkara* is used before *vallī* here so that someone does not consider *vallī* (creeper) like *rauṅgī* (a type of creeper) as infinite-bodied when it is used as a vegetable or lentil). All these are famous in the Aryan country. They are also famous in some parts of the Mleccha country; this is mentioned in various scriptures like *Jīvābhigaman*. These are to be avoided by compassionate devotees. The wrong-sighted are unaware of the infinite-bodied nature of all these; they do not even consider plants to be living beings, let alone infinite-bodied beings.

**Verse 47:** Now, regarding the avoidance of unknown fruits:

* **Verse 47:** A wise person should not eat a fruit that is unknown to oneself or others, that has never been seen, heard of, or known. A wise person should only eat fruits that are known to them. If a clever person eats an unknown fruit unknowingly (due to ignorance), then their vow will be broken by eating a forbidden fruit. Secondly, they may accidentally eat a poisonous fruit, which could lead to death. Therefore, eating unknown fruits is prohibited.

**Verse 48:** Now, regarding the prohibition of nighttime meals:

* **Verse 48:** Food is made impure by the touch of ghosts, *vyantar* (a type of spirit), *piśāca* (a type of demon), *rākṣasa* (a type of demon), and other low-caste deities who roam freely at night. Therefore, one should not eat at night.

**Meaning:** It is said that at night, *rākṣasa* (demons) and other beings roam freely on the earth and make food impure by their touch. They also harass those who eat at night.

**Further, see:** 199

## The Harms of Nighttime Meals

**From Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verses 49-53**

**Verse 49:** In the depths of darkness, where eyes are useless, and creatures fall unseen, who would eat at night, unable to discern what they consume?

**Explanation:** In the darkness, eyes cannot function.  Ants, insects, flies, and other living beings may fall into food like oil, ghee, buttermilk, etc., and remain unseen.  Who would be wise enough to eat at night under such circumstances?

**Verses 50-52:** Now, we describe the visible harms of nighttime meals in three verses.

* An ant, if eaten, destroys intelligence.
* A louse, if swallowed, causes dropsy.
* A fly, if ingested, leads to vomiting.
* An earwig, if consumed, causes leprosy.
* A thorn or piece of wood, if lodged in the throat, causes pain.
* A scorpion, if present in vegetables, can pierce the palate.
* A hair stuck in the throat can cause voice impairment.

These and other such harms are evident to all who eat at night.

**Explanation:**  Eating at night can lead to many harms.  If an ant is consumed, it destroys intelligence.  If a louse is eaten, it causes dropsy.  If a fly is ingested, it leads to vomiting.  If an earwig is consumed, it causes leprosy.  A thorn or piece of wood, if lodged in the throat, causes pain.  If a scorpion is present in vegetables and eaten, it can pierce the palate.  A hair stuck in the throat can cause voice impairment.

**Question:**  Ants and other small creatures are invisible, but a scorpion is large and visible.  How could it be swallowed?

**Answer:**  A scorpion might be mistaken for a vegetable like eggplant, which is similar in size.  If eaten, the consequences would be dire.

**Verse 53:**  Even if the tiny creatures are not visible, and the food is inanimate, like dry grains, one should not eat at night.  Those who have attained perfect knowledge, with their knowledge-eyes, have neither accepted nor prescribed nighttime meals.

**Explanation:**  Even if the food is inanimate, like dry grains, and prepared during the day, one should not eat at night.  Why?  Because even in the brightest light, tiny creatures like mites and ants are invisible.  Those with perfect knowledge, using their knowledge-power, have recognized this and therefore have not prescribed or accepted nighttime meals.

## Opinions of Other Dharma Shastras and Ayurveda Shastra Regarding the Abandonment of Night Meals

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verses 54-59**

Many microscopic beings enter food, therefore, that food does not remain devoid of life. In the Nisheeth commentary, it is stated that "Even though sweets and other dry and cooked substances are prepared during the day and not at night, still, tiny creatures like Kunthua, Kai-Phulan (Panak) etc. are not visible even at night, therefore, they should not be eaten."  A Pratyakshagyani (direct knower), Kevalgyani (omniscient) and Sarvagya (all-knowing) can know or see those microscopic beings with their knowledge power; yet they do not eat at night. Although ants and other creatures are visible in the light of lamps etc., many times, while eating at night, tiny flying creatures fall into the light of lamps etc. or into the food and die, therefore, specific knowers have not accepted or prescribed night meals due to the possibility of violating the Mulavrat (fundamental vow) of Ahimsa (non-violence). || 53 ||

**In this regard, it is stated:**

**225.** Dharmavinnaiva Bhunjeet, Kadachan Dinatyaye. Baahya Api Nisha Bhojya, Yadabhojya Prachakshate. || 54 ||

**Meaning:** Those who do not follow the Jain teachings, other opinionated people, also call night meals as inedible. Therefore, a Dharmagyani Shravak should never eat after sunset. || 54 ||

**Meaning:**  Other opinionated scriptures prohibit night meals after sunset.

**226.** Trayitejomayo Bhanur iti Vedavido Viduh. Tatkarai: Puutamkhilam Shubham Karma Samacharet. || 55 ||

**Meaning:** Knowers of the Vedas consider the Sun to be imbued with the brilliance of the three Vedas - Rig Veda, Yajur Veda, and Sama Veda. Therefore, one of the names of the Sun is 'Trayitanu'. Hence, one should perform only those auspicious deeds that are purified by the rays of the Sun. In their absence, one should not perform auspicious deeds. || 55 ||

**Continuing the same point:**

**227.** Naivahutir na cha Snaanam na Shraddham Devatarchanam. Danam Vaavihitam Ratrau Bhojanam tu Visheshatah. || 56 ||

**Meaning:** Offering oblations (ahutis) i.e., putting firewood etc. into the fire, bathing, cleansing the body, Shraddha Karma - worship of ancestors and other deities, worship of deities, charity, sacrifices, etc. auspicious deeds, especially night meals, are not prescribed; they are not to be done. || 56 ||

**Here, the question arises that it is heard that night meals are beneficial; and it is not possible without eating at night. In response to this, this verse is presented:**

**228.** Divasyashtame Bhaage, Mandibute Diwakare. Naktam tu Tad Vijaniyat, Na Naktam Nishibhojanam. || 57 ||

**Meaning:** When the Sun becomes weak in the eighth part of the day, that should be known as 'Naktam'. 'Naktam' does not mean night meals. || 57 ||

**Explanation:** The meal taken in the eighth part of the day, i.e., in the last half of the day, is called 'Naktam'. The meaning of a word can be understood in two ways - primarily and secondarily. Sometimes, one should act primarily according to one meaning and sometimes, if there is an obstacle in acting primarily according to one meaning, then one should act according to the secondary meaning. Here, there is an obstacle according to the scriptures, because night meals are prohibited in the scriptures, i.e., the secondary meaning of 'Naktam' is - a little bit of the day remaining, eating at that time. Here, the word 'Naktam' is primarily used for night meals, therefore, one should act according to the secondary meaning of 'Naktam'. One should eat when the Sun is weak - in the eighth part of the day; that should be understood as 'Naktam' meals. The conclusion is that due to the prohibition of the primary meaning, 'Naktam' should not mean night meals. Where else are night meals prohibited in other scriptures? || 57 ||

**This is explained in two verses:**

**229.** Devaistu Bhuktam Puraahne, Madhyahne Rishibhistatha. Aparaahna cha Pitribhih, Sayaahne Daitya Danavaih. || 58 ||

**230.** Sandhyaayam Yaksha Rakshobhih Sada Bhuktam Kulodvah! Sarvavelaam Vyatikramya, Ratrau Bhuktamabhojanam. || 59 ||

**Meaning:** Devas eat in the first watch of the day, Rishis eat at midday (noon), Pitras eat in the third watch of the day, and Daitya Danavas eat in the evening (twilight); day and night,

## The Evils of Nighttime Meals and the Benefits of Abstaining

**Chapter 3, Verses 60-66 of the Yoga Shastra**

In the transitional period, between day and night, Yakshas and Rakshasas eat. Therefore, O Yudhishthira, the sustainer of your lineage, it is forbidden to eat at night, violating all these times of meals for the Devas and others. ||58-59||

Now, in accordance with the prohibition of nighttime meals mentioned in the Puranas, we will confirm this statement from the perspective of Ayurveda. ||231||

**Verse 60:**

* **Meaning:** When the sun sets, the lotus of the heart and the navel lotus within the body contract, and along with the food, subtle beings are also consumed. Therefore, one should not eat at night. ||60||

**Verse 61:**

* **Meaning:** Those who eat at night, consuming a multitude of living beings that fall into their food, are no better than Rakshasas, if not worse. How can they be considered wise? ||61||

**Verse 62:**

* **Meaning:** One who eats continuously, day and night, is truly a beast without horns or a tail. ||62||

**Verse 63:**

* **Meaning:** One who, knowing the evils of nighttime meals, abstains from eating for two ghatikas (48 minutes) at the beginning of the day and two ghatikas at the end of the night, is blessed with great merit. ||63||

**Explanation:** One who eats two ghatikas after sunrise and two ghatikas before sunset (i.e., abstaining from eating for two ghatikas at the beginning of the day and two ghatikas at the end of the night) is a virtuous soul. This noble person has understood the evils of nighttime meals. They consider the two ghatikas near nighttime to be harmful. Therefore, the Agamas prescribe that the most severe form of pratyakhyana (abstinence) is performed after the nine-fold namaskara (salutation) and before the end of the day, one muhurta (48 minutes) before the Shravaka (Jain lay follower) refrains from eating and then performs pratyakhyana. ||63||

**Verse 64:**

* **Meaning:** One who eats during the day without observing the rule of abstaining from nighttime meals may receive some general benefits, but not the specific benefits of pratyakhyana. Just as a deposit does not accrue interest without a specific agreement, similarly, one who eats during the day without observing the rule does not receive the specific benefits of observing the rule. ||64||

**Verse 65:**

* **Meaning:** Those who, abandoning the sun-lit day, eat only at night, are like fools who abandon a precious jewel and take a piece of glass. ||65||

**Verse 66:**

* **Meaning:** Those who, desiring good fortune, eat at night despite the presence of the day, are like those who sow seeds in barren land, even though they are of the finest quality. ||66||

## Description of Night Meals and Bi-Parted (Food)

**Explanation of Verses 67 to 70 from the Third Light of Yoga Shastra:**

Even if the day is favorable, one who eats at night with the hope of some benefit is like someone who sows rice in barren land, abandoning fertile land. ||66||

**Explanation:** Even if food is available during the day, a person who eats at night due to a desire for benefit - whether it be due to the inspiration of a good scripture or a good teacher, or due to traditional customs or delusion, or a desire for good fortune - is like a farmer who, despite having fertile fields, sows rice in barren land instead. The rule of eating only at night is as pointless as sowing seeds in barren land. A rule that prevents wrongdoing is fruitful; a rule that only obstructs the path of righteousness is fruitless or yields adverse results. In reality, such a contrary insistence cannot be called a rule. ||66||

Now, regarding the consequences of night meals: ||238||

Owls, crows, cats, vultures, demons, pigs, snakes, scorpions, and crocodiles are born from those who eat at night. ||67||

**Explanation:** Those who eat at night are born in the next life as owls, crows, cats, vultures, demons, pigs, snakes, scorpions, and crocodiles, among other low-caste animals. ||67||

Further, the importance of abandoning night meals is explained using the example of Vanamala: ||239||

It is heard that Vanamala made Lakshmana swear an oath regarding the sin of eating at night, ignoring all other oaths. ||68||

**Explanation:** It is heard in the Ramayana that Lakshmana, the son of Dasharatha, was going towards the south with Rama and Sita, following his parents' orders. On the way, he came to Kubera Nagar, where he married Vanamala, the daughter of King Maheedhar. When Lakshmana was taking leave of Vanamala to go ahead with Rama, Vanamala, distressed by the separation from her husband and hoping for his quick return, said to Lakshmana, "My dear husband! Please swear an oath to me." Lakshmana said, "My dear! If I do not return to you after taking Rama to his desired land, may my fate be the same as those who commit acts like killing living beings. But Vanamala was not satisfied with this oath. She said, "My beloved! I can only allow you to go if you swear an oath like this: If I do not return, may my fate be the same as those who eat at night." Therefore, Lakshmana, at Vanamala's request, took such an oath, and only then did she allow him to depart for another country. This means that Vanamala disregarded other oaths and made Lakshmana swear an oath regarding night meals. Writing more would make the text lengthy, so we stop here. ||68||

Apart from the scriptural example, now we explain the consequences of abandoning night meals as proven by the experiences of ordinary people: ||240||

One who always abstains from night meals is blessed. Indeed, he remains fasting for half his lifespan (i.e., every night). ||69||

**Explanation:** A righteous person who abandons night meals spends half his lifespan in fasting. Even one fast is highly beneficial as it leads to purification. If someone has a lifespan of a hundred years, then fifty years are spent in fasting; imagine the benefits! In short, there are many drawbacks to eating at night, and many virtues in abandoning it. It is beyond our capacity to describe them all. ||69||

This is what is said: ||241||

Even if these virtues are mentioned, no one other than the omniscient can speak of them. ||70||

##  Food contaminated with minute living beings and four types of wrong conduct

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verses 71-73**

**Meaning:**  Only the omniscient can fully describe the virtues of abstaining from food at night. ||70||

Now, the prohibition of eating lentils mixed with raw milk, yogurt, or buttermilk is explained. ||242||

**Verse 71:**  The omniscient have seen minute living beings in lentils like mung beans, black gram, etc., mixed with raw yogurt. Therefore, one should avoid them. ||71||

**Explanation:**  Jainism has a system where some things are understood through reasoning and some are understood through scriptures (Agama, Aapta Vachan).  Things that can be known through logic, reasoning, and experience are explained through reasoning.  Things that cannot be known or proven through reasoning are explained through scriptures and the words of the enlightened.  One who follows this is considered a follower of the teachings.  Conversely, one who explains things that can be understood through reasoning using scriptures, and tries to explain things that are understood through scriptures using reasoning, is considered a violator of the teachings.  It is said, "One who accepts the reasoning side through reasoning, and the scriptural side through scriptures, and presents their own principles truthfully, is a follower of the teachings.  Conversely, one who speaks against this is a violator of the teachings, as they are presenting a contradictory view."

According to this logic, it is not appropriate to prove or know the existence of living beings in lentils and other grains mixed with raw yogurt through reasoning (logic, reasoning, or direct observation).  Rather, it is appropriate to know the existence of these living beings through scriptures and have faith in those words.  The omniscient have seen living beings in lentils mixed with yogurt.  The word "etc." implies that they have also seen living beings in cooked food, yogurt that is more than two days old, and spoiled food.  One should understand this.  Therefore, one should avoid food containing these living beings, as well as food containing lentils mixed with raw milk, yogurt, buttermilk, etc.  Otherwise, one incurs the sin of *praṇātipāta*, the first type of *āśrava*.  The words of the omniscient are infallible, so they should be considered authoritative and accepted with faith.  Therefore, one should not think that only things like alcohol and spoiled or rotten food are forbidden, and everything else is permissible.  Rather, one should avoid any food that contains living beings, whether it is understood through one's own intellect or through scriptures. ||71|| (Sanmati 142)

**Verse 72:**  A devotee devoted to Jainism should avoid fruits (like berries), flowers, leaves, pickles, or other things that are mixed with or contaminated with living beings. ||72||

**Explanation:**  One should avoid fruits like *madhūk* (mahua) that contain *tras* living beings, flowers like *arani*, mustard, and *mahua*, leaves like *chaulai*, and other roots or tubers.  Pickles made from mangoes, lemons, etc., should also be avoided if they are contaminated with *nīlaṇa*, *phūlaṇa*, or other living beings.  Because devotees who practice compassion for living beings do not eat food that causes harm to them.  Earning wealth for the purpose of enjoyment and consumption is also considered enjoyment and consumption through proper means.  Its quantity also falls under this vow.  Therefore, a devotee should avoid *kharakama* (forbidden, inferior occupations that involve killing *tras*, excessive killing, increase in carelessness, increase in non-restraint, being condemned by the world, and being avoided by virtuous people) and earn their livelihood through honest and blameless occupations.  We will discuss all of this in the context of *aticāra*.  Thus, the description of the vow of *bhoga-upabhoga-parimāṇa* is complete. ||72||

Now, the opportunity has arisen to describe the vow of *anarthadanda-viramaṇa*.  Therefore, the four types of *anarthadanda* are explained in two verses.

**Verse 73:**  *Ārtta*, *raudrā*, *apadhyāna*, *pāpakarma-upadeśitā*, *hiṃsrā-upākāri-dāna*, and *pramāda-ācaraṇa* are the four types of *anarthadanda*. ||73||

The nature of *Artt-Roudra-Dhyan* and the *Anarth-Dand* in the form of advice on sin.

Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verses 74-75. 245.

The *Anarth-Dand* which is opposite to the *Arth-Dand* for the body, etc., is the third *Gun-Vrat*. ||74||

Meaning: To engage in *Artt-Roudra-Dhyan*, to advise or encourage sinful acts, to provide means of violence to others, and to engage in careless conduct; these are the four types of *Anarth-Dand*. The *Arth-Dand* is the necessary beginning or tendency towards the body, etc., but the *Anarth-Dand* is that which brings no benefit except harm to oneself or others, and which causes the soul to be punished without reason. To abandon it is the third *Gun-Vrat*. ||73-74||

Explanation: To think badly is the first type of *Anarth-Dand*. It has two divisions: *Artt-Dhyan* and *Roudra-Dhyan*. *Artt-Dhyan* - *Rit*. That which arises from sorrow is called *Artt* or *Aarti*, meaning pain or torture. The meditation that arises from it is *Artt-Dhyan*. (Dhyan Shatak 6-10) It has four types: 1. When one comes into contact with unpleasant words, etc., the polluted being, due to attachment, worries about their complete separation from them; and also thinks that they should not come into contact with them again. 2. When there is pain in the stomach, pain in the head, or pain in any part of the body, to cry out, to writhe, to think intensely about their separation from it again and again. To worry that they should not come into contact with it again, and to become agitated in mind to counteract it. 3. When one obtains favorable objects of pleasure, such as words, etc., and those that are pleasant to the senses, to have a strong attachment (attachment) to them, and to think that they should never be separated from them, and that they should continue to come into contact with them again and again. 4. To make a request in the form of a remedy for the wealth, form, or happiness, etc., of Indra, Chakravarti, etc., or to writhe in agony for the attainment of an unseen, unheard, or unknown object, and to meditate on it in a wicked way. These four types of *Artt-Dhyan* occur to beings who are filled with attachment, aversion, delusion, and ignorance. *Artt-Dhyan* increases the cycle of birth and death, which is like a world, and leads to *Tiyach-Gati*.

*Roudra-Dhyan* - *Roudra* means terrible. That which is terrible in nature or which causes others to cry and suffer is called *Roudra-Dhyan*. *Roudra-Dhyan* is also of four types: 1. *Hinsa-Anubandhi*, 2. *Mrish-Anubandhi*, 3. *Steya-Anubandhi*, and 4. *Sanrakshan-Anubandhi*. (a) To kill beings, to bind them, to burn them, to beat them, to break them, to riot, etc., or to create a conspiracy in the mind about violence, to make a violent plan in the mind, to think cruelly about the aforementioned things; this is the first *Hinsa-Anubandhi* *Roudra-Dhyan*. Such a *Roudra-Dhyani* is extremely cruel, very angry, heartless, and leads to evil consequences.

(b) To falsely accuse someone else (to slander them), to deceive someone, to trap them in one's web of illusion, to deceive them, to lie, to gossip about someone else, to break a promise, to break a vow, to create a false conspiracy, etc., to be involved in such scheming or quarreling, to think about it day and night; this is the second *Roudra-Dhyan* called *Mrish-Anubandhi*. Such a *Roudra-Dhyan* practitioner is deceitful, a cheat, and a secret sinner.

(c) To be overwhelmed by intense greed and desire, to seize the wealth of others, to snatch it away, to take possession of another's land and property, to steal, to rob, to loot, to obtain more money, to think of such unethical schemes, or to be immersed in the contemplation of new and innovative ways of stealing; this is the third *Steya-Anubandhi* *Roudra-Dhyan*. Such a person is also cruel in consequence, extremely greedy, devoted to the acquisition of wealth, and fearless of the consequences of sin in the afterlife.

(d) To be constantly suspicious of the loss of words, etc., or of means and wealth, to worry about how to accumulate wealth, to deceive the government, partners, or others, to protect wealth or means; to be immersed in such worries day and night; such a person is a *Sanrakshan-Anubandhi* *Roudra-Dhyani*. Such a person is cruel enough to kill the person who takes away or spends their wealth. These four types of *Roudra-Dhyan* occur to beings who are afflicted by the passions of attachment, aversion, and delusion; they increase the world and lead to hell. (Dhyan Shatak 18-24) This *Artt-Roudra-Dhyan* in the form of bad meditation is the first *Anarth-Dand*.

## Description of *Pramadaacharan*

**Chapter 3, Light 75-77 of Yoga Shastra**

**There are four types of *Anarthadanda* (unnecessary punishment):**

1. ***Papokadesha* (Giving advice on sinful acts):**  Giving advice, inspiration, or orders that promote sinful activities like violence.
2. ***Hinsra Pradhan* (Giving instruments of violence):** Giving weapons like knives, swords, daggers, or any other tools of violence to someone, or placing such weapons in the hands of an unskilled or ignorant person.
3. ***Pramada Sevan* (Indulging in frivolous activities):** Engaging in activities that stimulate lust and other negative emotions, such as women's dances, songs, and erotic stories.
4. ***Anarthadanda* (Unnecessary punishment):**  This is the opposite of *Arthadanda* (necessary punishment). *Arthadanda* is when a person is punished for a necessary action, such as performing a duty for their family or body. *Anarthadanda* is when a person engages in activities that have no purpose and only lead to negative consequences.

**The third *Gunavrata* (virtuous vow) is *Anarthadanda Viramna Vrata* (Vow to abstain from unnecessary punishment).** This vow involves abstaining from all actions that fall under the category of *Anarthadanda*.

**Verses 73-74:** It is said that performing necessary actions for the sake of one's senses or loved ones is *Arthadanda*. However, engaging in harmful activities like violence without any purpose is *Anarthadanda*.

**Now, the text explains the nature and consequences of *Apadhyan* (inattentiveness):**

**Verse 75:** *Apadhyan* is a state of mind where one is consumed by harmful thoughts, such as:

* Desiring to destroy an enemy.
* Engaging in political intrigue or causing unrest in a city.
* Destroying property or setting fires.
* Indulging in thoughts of space travel or exploring unknown realms.

One should abandon such harmful thoughts immediately.

**Verse 76:** The text now discusses how to avoid *Papokadesha* (giving advice on sinful acts):

* It is not appropriate for a Jain to give advice that promotes sinful activities, such as:
    * Encouraging someone to subdue calves, plow fields, or castrate horses.
    * Giving advice that leads to violence or other harmful actions.

* It is acceptable to give advice to one's own children or family members, but only for the purpose of guiding them in the right direction.
* It is never acceptable to encourage someone to engage in harmful activities like drinking alcohol, gambling, or engaging in immoral behavior.

**Verse 77:** The text now prohibits giving instruments of violence to others:

* A compassionate Jain should not give tools of violence, such as:
    * *Yantra* (a type of mill), *Langal* (plow), *Shastra* (weapons), *Agni* (fire), *Musala* (pestle), *Ukhala* (mortar), *Dhanush* (bow), *Dhaunkni* (bellows), *Churi* (knife), etc.

* This prohibition applies to everyone except one's own children or family members.

**Now, the text discusses the fourth *Anarthadanda*, which is *Pramadaacharan* (indulging in frivolous activities):**

**Verse 206:** This verse marks the beginning of the discussion on *Pramadaacharan*.

## Explanation of the Text of Samayik Sutra

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 82**

**Food:** Modak, kheer, suran, and other tubers, as well as malpuas and other types of food are considered **Asan** (food). Rice, sattu, moong, jowar, cooked food, kheer, suran, and puan are all forms of **Asan** (food).

**Drink:** Sauvir, kanji, barley, and other grains, wine, sherbet, and all types of beverages, as well as fruit juices are considered **Pan** (drink).

**Edible:** Roasted and baked grains, gudpapri or tilpatti, dates, coconut, raisins, cucumber, mango, grapes, pomegranate, mosambi, orange, and many other types of fruits are considered **Khady** (edible).

**Savory:** Datun or toothpaste, pan (tambool), tulsi, mulathi, ajwain, saunf, piparamal, sonth, black pepper, cumin, turmeric, baheda, amla, etc. are considered **Swadya** (savory).

**(Panchashak 5/27. Three types of Gunavrata are complete. ||81||)**

**Now, the four types of Shikshavrata are described. There are four types of Shikshavrata: Samayik, Deshavakashik, Poushadhopavas, and Atithisanvibhaag. The first Shikshavrata, called Samayik, describes the nature of Samayik. ||253||**

**Tyaktataroudradhyanasya tyakt-savadyakarmaanah | Muhurttam samata ya tam, viduh samayaikavratam ||82||**

**Meaning:** Abandoning **Art** and **Roudradhyan** (intense meditation), and abandoning all types of sinful activities, maintaining **Samata** (equanimity) for one **Muhurt** (two ghadi hours) is called **Samayik Vrata** by the great souls. ||8||

**Explanation:** **Samayik Vrata** is to remain neutral in the causes of **Rag** (attachment) and **Dvesha** (aversion) for one **Muhurt** (two ghadi hours). The word **Samayik** is derived from **Sam** (free from attachment and aversion) and **Ay** (benefit of knowledge, etc.). It means the experience of **Prashmasukh** (peace and happiness). **Sam + Ay = Samay** is **Samayik**. According to the rules of grammar, the suffix **Ikan** is added here. Therefore, **Samay + Ikan** becomes **Samayik**. This **Samayik** cannot be achieved without abandoning the faulty actions (activities) of the mind, speech, and body. Therefore, the verse refers to **Samayik** as the abandonment of **Art** and **Roudradhyan**. Abandoning sinful activities is also **Samayik**, and the equanimity of those who abandon faulty speech and bodily actions is also called **Samayik**. A householder who observes **Samayik** is like a **Sadhu** (saint). It is said, "**Samaiyammi u kae samano iv savao**" - meaning, during **Samayik**, a Shravak (lay devotee) becomes like a **Sadhu**. Therefore, a Shravak should observe **Samayik** many times. (**Aav. Ni. 801**) And for this reason, there is no provision for **Devsnatrapuja** (worship of gods and bathing) in **Samayik**.

**Doubt:** There is a doubt that **Devpuja** (worship of gods) and **Snatra** (bathing) are religious activities. What is the fault in doing them during **Samayik**? In **Samayik**, one abandons faulty activities and accepts faultless activities. From this perspective, what is the fault in doing **Devpuja** etc. during **Samayik**, similar to doing **Swadhyay** (self-study) and repeating the text?

**Solution:** It is not right to say that. A Shravak who observes **Samayik** like a **Sadhu** does not have the right to worship gods. **Dravyapuja** (material worship) is the cause of **Bhavapuja** (emotional worship). Therefore, when a Shravak is in **Samayik**, there is no need for **Dravyastav** (material worship) for the object that is obtained through **Bhavastav** (emotional worship). It is said, "**Dravy puja and Bhavpuja, among these two, Dravy puja is very virtuous; this is the word of an ignorant person; this is what Shri Jinendra Bhagwan, the well-wisher of the six-souled beings, has said.**"

**Types of Samayik:** There are two types of Shravaks who observe **Samayik**: those with **Riddhi** (spiritual powers) and those without **Riddhi**.

**Places for Samayik:** **Samayik** is observed in four places: in the **Jin Mandir** (Jain temple), near a **Sadhu**, in a **Poushadhashala** (medicine dispensary), and in one's own home in a quiet, secluded place or a place free from business.

**Procedure of Samayik:** If there is no fear from anyone, no dispute or quarrel with anyone, no debt to anyone, no need to talk, no pulling or pushing, and no mental distress, then one can observe **Samayik** at home. While observing **Samayik**, one should purify **Iryasamiti** (the five senses), abandon faulty speech, and if one needs wood, stones, or any other object, one should take permission from the owner. One should look carefully with one's eyes, copy it, and accept it after cleaning it with a **Pramarjanika** (cleaning cloth). One should carefully abandon saliva, phlegm, nasal mucus, and **Lghuniti** (minor activities). One should look at the place carefully and clean the ground. In this way, one should observe **Samayik** with care, following the five **Samiti** (principles) and three **Gupti** (secrets). If there is a **Sadhu**, one should go to the **Upashray** (Jain monastery) and offer them **Vandana** (respectful greetings) and accept **Samayik** with the following text:

## The Meaning and Method of Samayik Sutra

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 82:**

"Karemi Bhanta, Samaiyam Savajan Jogam Pacchakkhami, Jav Sahuu Pajjuvasami Duvihan Tivhehan, Manen Vayae Kaeyan, Na Karemi Na Karavemi, Tass Bhanta Padikkamami Nindami Girihami Appaan Vosarami."

Here, the meaning of Samayik Sutra is explained:

* **Karemi:** I accept.
* **Bhanta:** This is an invitation to the Guru Maharaj, meaning "O Venerable One." The word "Bhad" means happiness and welfare. The suffix "Ant" is added to it, making it "Bhadant." This address is an invitation to the direct Guru. Jain scriptures state that in the absence of a direct Guru, one can imagine a direct Guru in their mind for an indirect Guru. Just as in the absence of Jineshwardev, one praises, worships, and addresses the Jin-image, similarly, in the absence of a direct Guru, one can imagine them in their mind and perform all religious actions with respect. Therefore, the word "Bhanta" is used in the sense of an invitation. It is said, "He who resides in the Guru's abode is knowledgeable. He becomes very stable in his vision and character. Therefore, fortunate and excellent souls never leave the Guru's abode (the shelter of the Guru) throughout their lives." (Vi. Bha. 34/59)
* **Bhanta:** Alternatively, the word "Bhanta" is derived from "Bhavant" based on the rules of Prakrit grammar. The word "Bhavant" means "one who crosses over and makes others cross over the cycle of birth and death."
* **Samaiyam:** The meaning of "Samaiyam" has been explained earlier. It means that the practitioner resolves to keep the soul stable in equanimity.
* **Savajan Jogam Pacchakkhami:** How will the soul become stable in equanimity? The next resolution is "Savajan Jogam Pacchakkhami." "Savajan" means sinful, and "Jog" means the activity of mind, speech, and body. "Pacchakkhami" means to abandon. The practitioner here resolves against sinful activities or decides not to engage in them with respect.
* **Jav Sahuu Pajjuvasami:** How long will this resolution last? The rule is stated further: "Jav Sahuu Pajjuvasami," meaning "as long as I serve the Sadhu, I will perform Samayik."
* **Jav:** The word "Jav" has three meanings: 1. Quantity, 2. Limit, and 3. Determination. The meaning of quantity is to abandon sinful activities for as long as one serves the Sadhu. The meaning of limit is to abandon sinful behavior before starting to serve the Sadhu or before taking Samayik. The meaning of determination is to abandon sinful activities only for as long as one serves the Sadhu, not after that. Thus, one should understand the three meanings of the word "Jav." However, nowadays, "Javanayam" is spoken. This means that the duration of Samayik is considered to be at least one Muhurt (two Ghadi, 48 minutes) in the present time. Therefore, the implied meaning is to abandon sinful activities from the beginning to the end of Samayik, not after that.
* **Duvihan Tivhehan:** In what form does the practitioner abandon these sinful activities? The next part of the text explains this: "Duvihan Tivhehan." This means that the practitioner must abandon sinful activities in two ways and three ways during Samayik. Where the abandonment of sinful activities is twofold, it should be understood from two causes: "Na Karemi, Na Karavemi." This means that I will not engage in sinful activities myself, nor will I cause others to do so. In this way, the householder practitioner abandons sinful activities that can occur in both these ways during Samayik. The prohibition of sinful activities in the form of approval is not included, as it is impossible for a householder to do so. Even if one does not do the work themselves, the fault of approval arises if it is done by a son, servant, etc.
* **Tivhehan:** Now, understand the meaning of "three ways." Here, the third case is used in the cause. This means that there are three means for sinful activities: mind, speech, and body. These are called three Yogas in Jain scriptures. Therefore, it is said: "Manen, Vayae, Kaeyan," meaning that one abandons sinful activities through these three Yogas: mind, speech, and body. The phrase "Na Karemi, Na Karavemi" describes both ways: I will not do it myself, nor will I cause it to be done, through mind, speech, and body. Then, the cause, i.e., the purpose...

## The Meaning and Method of Samayik Sutra

The meaning and method of Samayik Sutra is explained in detail, violating the third light verse 82 of Yoga Shastra. It is said that Yoga is merely a perception, as it is subject to the cause. Yoga exists only in the presence of the cause, and in the absence of the cause, Yoga is absent. 'Tasseti' here refers to the authorized Yoga of 'Tasy'. Here, the sixth case ending is used in the relationship of the part and the whole. This Yoga is related to all three times. Therefore, the past deeds that were done with faults are 'Padikkhamami', meaning I retreat from that sinful act. 'Nindami Garihami' means I condemn it, and 'Gurda' means I reveal it in the presence of the Guru. This includes only condemnation done by self-witness, and 'Gurda' is to condemn oneself in the presence of the Guru. In this Sutra, the word 'Bhanta' appears again, which is to indicate excessive devotion and to invite the Guru again. Therefore, it is not like the fault of repetition. Or, the Guru is addressed again for the return of the Samayik action. This proves that at the end of all actions, devotion should be shown towards the Guru.

The commentator has also said that the word 'Bhadant' or 'Bhanta' is also indicative of the return of Samayik, knowing this, one should return at the end of all actions. (Vi. Bha. 3571) And 'Appaanam', meaning my soul, has done sinful deeds in the past, I specifically renounce them with 'Vosirami'. In the present Samayik text, 'Karemi Bhanta Samaiyam' is used for renouncing the present sinful deeds, 'Tass Bhanta Padikkhamami' is used for renouncing the past sinful deeds, and 'Pacchakkhami' is used for renouncing the future sinful deeds. In this way, the seeker has to renounce the sinful deeds of all three times in Samayik. Therefore, the use of all three sentences does not appear to be a fault of repetition. It is also said, 'Aiyan Nindami, Paduppannam Sanvaremi Anagayam Pacchakkhami'. Meaning, I condemn the past sins, I control (stop) them for the present, and I renounce the sinful deeds for the future. In this way, the seeker makes a rule.

The Shravak should perform Iriya-vahi Pratikraman in his own house or at another place, taking Samayik. Later, he should criticize the sinful deeds done by going and coming, and then respectfully salute the seated Acharya, Muni Rajas, etc. in order. Then, after saluting the Guru Maharaj, he should sit down after writing down the posture (Katasan) etc. After that, he should listen to the Dharma from the Guru Maharaj and study new things. Or, he should ask where there is doubt. This method should be understood in the local Jain temple or lecture hall. But if one takes Samayik at home or in a Jain temple, lecture hall, Upashraya, or dispensary, then he should stay there; he does not need to go anywhere else. This is the method of a common Shravak.

Now, the method of a king or a wealthy Shravak is said to be as follows: If a Shravak is a king or something similar, and he is sitting on an excellent mount like an elephant, adorned with royal insignia like an umbrella and a fly whisk, and ornaments, and is coming with an elephant, horse, chariot, and infantry, accompanied by excellent instruments like a drum, making the sky resonate, creating curiosity among the local people with the noise of the praises of the bards and charanas, with the ostentatious competition of many vassals and mandala kings, to see the Munis, then people will point their fingers at him and say, 'This great soul is a devout and righteous person.' Seeing the king or the wealthy person eager to see the Munis, the feeling of Dharma arises in the minds of other people. They also think, 'When will we do Dharma like this?' Therefore, the fellow Dharma practitioners should salute the said devout king with folded hands, and throw Akshat etc. In response to their salutations, the king himself should also approve of Dharma, 'Blessed is this Dharma, whose great soul serves it.' In this way, praising Dharma by the general public, the king or the wealthy person should go to the Jain temple or the Upashraya where the Sadhus and Sadhvis reside. Upon reaching there, he should remove the royal insignia like the umbrella, fly whisk, crown, sword, and shoes, and then salute the Jina or the Sadhus and Sadhvis. If the king goes to the Upashraya or Jain temple after taking Samayik, then the elephant, horse, etc. will be with him. There will be weapons or an army. It will not be appropriate to do so in Samayik. Suppose the king goes on foot after taking Samayik, even then it is inappropriate. If the Shravak king comes quietly in a simple dress or like a common person, then no one will stand up to welcome him.

## Example of Chandravatsanka in Samayik, Deshavakashik Vrat

**Yoga Shastra, Third Prakash, Verses 83-85**

Therefore, with utmost humility and in a proper manner, when the king arrives, a seat should be prepared for him beforehand, and the same respect and worship should be offered. Nothing else should be done. The Acharya Maharaj should already be up and walking around, so that he doesn't have to stand up when the king arrives. Because in this regard, there is no fault in standing or not standing. This is just a matter of conduct. The king or a Riddhiman Shravak should be respectfully honored in this way during Samayik. Staying in Samayik leads to Maha Nirjara. || 82 ||

This is explained through an example:

**254. Samayikvratasthasy, Grihino'pi Sthiratmanah | Chandravatsakasyaeva, Kshiyate Karma Sanchitam || 83 ||**

**Meaning:** Even though he is a householder, the accumulated karma of a soul who is steadfast in Samayik Vrat, like the king Chandravatsanka, is destroyed. || 83 ||

This example is understood through the Guru Parampara. It is as follows:

Chandravatsanka, the king, was in Samadhi during Samayik.

There was a city called Sanketapura, which was as bright as the house of Lakshmi, surpassing the beauty of Indrapuri. There, the king Chandravatsanka, who was like a second moon adorning the crown of the earth, ruled. The wise king, to protect his country, wore weapons, and similarly, to protect his inner qualities, he also wore four strong and strict Shikshavrats. In the month of Magh, once at night, in his own residence, he embraced Samayik and, with this resolve, stood in Kayotsarga, saying, "As long as this lamp burns, I will remain in Samayik." When the oil in the lamp started to run low, his bed-chamber maid, thinking that the master should not be in darkness, poured more oil into the lamp in the first watch of the night. Out of devotion, she stayed awake until the second watch and then went and poured more oil into the lamp. The lamp continued to burn. Therefore, the king continued his Kayotsarga according to his resolve (Abhigha) until the third watch. The bed-chamber maid was unaware of the king's resolve, so she poured more oil into the lamp again. The night was over. Morning arrived, but the king remained standing in Kayotsarga according to his resolve. Due to the fatigue of the whole night, his body was shattered and could not bear the pain any longer, so he fell down with a thud. The king's body left him. But because he remained in Samadhi until the end, his evil karma was destroyed, and due to the binding of good karma, the king completed his lifespan and went to heaven. || 83 ||

Similarly, other householders, by embracing Samayik Vrat and remaining steadfast in Samadhi, will surely destroy their evil karma and attain immediate liberation. This is the essence of the story of Chandravatsanka.

Now, regarding the second Shiksha Vrat called Deshavakashik:

**255. Digvrate Parimanam Yat, Tasy Sanksepanam Punah | Dine Ratrau Cha Dishavakashikavratamuchyate || 84 ||**

**Meaning:** The shortening of the limits of travel in Digvrat for a day and night is called Deshavakashik Vrat. || 84 ||

**Explanation:** In the first Gunavrat called Digvrat, there are limits set for travel in all ten directions. Shortening these limits for a whole day and night, or specifically for a watch, is called Deshavakashik Vrat. Here, along with shortening the first Vrat in Digvrat, one should also understand the shortening of other Anuvrats, etc., by implication. If a separate Vrat were to be kept for shortening each Vrat, the number of Vrats would increase, and this would contradict the scriptural number of 12 Vrats. || 84 ||

Now, regarding the third Shiksha Vrat, Paushdhavrat:

**256. Chatushparvyam Chaturthadi, Kuvyaparanishedenam | Brahmacharyakriyasnanadityagah Paushdhavratam || 85 ||**

## The Method of Observing the Paushdha Vrat

**Meaning of Verses 85 and 86 from the Third Light of Yoga Shastra:**

**Verse 85:**  Observing fasts and austerities like Chaturthabhakta and Pratyakhyana on the four festival days, abandoning evil tendencies, practicing celibacy, and abstaining from bathing, adornment, etc., is called Paushdha Vrat.

**Explanation:** The eight, fourteenth, full moon, and new moon days are called festival days. It is prescribed for the Shravak to observe Paushdha Vrat on these days. This Vrat includes fasting and other austerities, along with abstaining from sinful tendencies, practicing celibacy, and giving up bodily rituals like bathing. The word "etc." also implies abstaining from oil massage, applying henna, applying sandalwood paste, using perfumes and flowers, wearing garlands of fragrant flowers or flower ornaments on the head, wearing expensive, colorful, and flashy clothes and ornaments, and adorning and beautifying the body. One should understand that these things are also to be abandoned. Abandoning these prohibited things and accepting celibacy and austerities to strengthen one's Dharma is called Paushdha Vrat.

There are two types of Paushdha: Desha Paushdha and Sarva Paushdha. Paushdha with food is called Desha Paushdha. However, Paushdha with food is observed by abstaining from various Vikrigayi (harmful substances) and by practicing Ayambil, Ekasan, or Biyasan. Paushdha for the entire day and night is observed with complete abstinence from all four types of food, including fasting. It includes Pratyakhyana until sunrise the next day. Abstaining from sinful tendencies partially is called Desha Paushdha. It involves giving up one or two sinful activities. Abstaining from all work and activities for one day and night, including farming, employment, business, animal husbandry, and all household activities and ceremonies, is called Sarva Vyapar Paushdha. Brahmacharya Paushdha is also of two types: Desha and Sarva. Abstaining from sexual intercourse more than once is called Desha Brahmacharya Paushdha, and observing complete celibacy for the entire day and night is called Sarva Brahmacharya Paushdha. Similarly, Snaanadi Tyaga Paushdha is also of two types: Desha and Sarva. Abstaining from bodily rituals like bathing more than once is called Desha Snaanadi Paushdha, and abstaining from bathing for the entire day and night is called Sarva Paushdha.

Here, when one observes Paushdha in the form of prohibiting evil activities (sinful tendencies) partially, one may not observe Samayik, but when one observes Sarva Paushdha, then one must observe Samayik. If one does not do so, then one will be deprived of the fruits of Paushdha. Whenever one observes Sarva Paushdha, one should do so in a secluded place in the Upashraya, Jin Mandir, or at home. Before observing Paushdha Vrat, one should abandon gold, gold ornaments, flower garlands, ointments, weapons, etc., and then observe Samayik Vrat. During Paushdha, one should engage in self-study, study, teaching, reading good literature, meditating on Dharma, and contemplating on Anupreksha (feelings). One should also reflect, "Alas! I am so unfortunate that I have not yet been able to acquire the qualities of a Sadhu."

Here, one should understand this point specifically: If Paushdha Vrat is observed with food, like abstaining from food, bodily rituals, and practicing celibacy, in the form of abstaining from evil activities, i.e., with Aagaras (possessions), then observing Samayik is meaningful, otherwise not. Because the rules of Paushdha are gross in nature, with possessions, while the rules of Samayik are subtle. Although it is necessary to completely abandon sinful activities (tendencies) in Paushdha, one does not benefit from it without observing Samayik. Therefore, one should observe Samayik along with Paushdha. If a Shravak Samachari observes Paushdha like Samayik, with the aforementioned two Karana and three Yoga, then the function of Samayik is fulfilled by Paushdha itself. Observing Samayik separately does not yield special benefits. However, if the Shravak intends to observe both Paushdha and Samayik Vrat, then he receives the benefits of both.

**Verse 86:** Even those who are householders are blessed, who observe the sacred Paushdha Vrat, which is difficult to observe, like a sieve.

**Meaning:**

1. Currently, Paushdha is observed with food, Desha, and Sarva. The rest of the Sarva Paushdha is observed only with Sarva. And at least Ekasana is observed.

**Note:** The translation attempts to preserve the Jain terms while conveying the meaning clearly.

In the Pauṣadhavrat, the steadfast Culanīpītā Śrāvaka
Yogaśāstra, Third Light, Verse 86
The example of the Culanīpītā is as follows:
The steadfastness of the Śrāvaka-vratadharī Culanīpītā in the Pauṣadha:
On the banks of the Ganges River, in the beautiful city of Vārāṇasī, which is like a jewel on the earth, with its intricate creations, there lived a great merchant named Mahāseṭha, who was like embodied Dharma among humans. He had a son named Culanīpītā. Just as the dark night (Śyāma) is the companion of the moon, which brings joy to the world, so too was his beautiful wife, Śyāma, who was his equal in Dharma. | Culanīpītā had a total wealth of 24 crore gold coins - eight crore gold coins were kept safe in the form of treasure in the ground, eight crore coins were invested in interest, and eight crore coins were used to run his business. | He had eight Gokulas, each with ten thousand cows. He had many other kinds of wealth in his house. In this way, he was the owner of a lot of land and property. Once, while wandering outside Vārāṇasī in the Koṣṭhaka garden, the supreme Tirthankara Śramaṇa Bhagavān Mahāvīrasvāmī arrived. Indra, along with the gods and goddesses, came to pay homage to the Lord's lotus feet, and the king of the city, Jitasatru, also arrived. When Culanīpītā heard this, he was overjoyed and, wearing appropriate clothes and ornaments for the Dharma assembly, he walked on foot to pay homage to the Lord of the Three Worlds. After paying homage and bowing to the Lord, he sat in the Dharma assembly and listened to the Lord's sermon with great devotion. | When the sermon was over, Culanīpītā bowed respectfully and requested the Lord, "Swāmin! Just as the sun travels only to illuminate the world, and has no other purpose, so too do you travel on the earth to enlighten people like me. In the world, everyone else is begged, and some give, some don't; but you, without begging, go to them directly and give Dharma-deśanā. This is due to your selfless grace. I know that I should accept the Anāgāra-dharma from you; but this unfortunate one does not yet have the ability, capacity, and strength to bear the burden of such a high character; | Blessed are those who bear the burden of complete character, who take initiation. I have a desire to receive the Śrāvakadharma from you. | I beg you to please grant me the Śrāvakadharma. The ocean is full of water, but a pot can only take as much water as it can hold.
The Lord replied, "Devānupriya! Do as you please. But do not delay in the work of Dharma." After that, Culanīpītā received twelve vows from the Lord as follows: He renounced gross violence, gross falsehood, gross non-giving, | and all women except his wife Śyāma. He made a rule not to keep more than eight crore gold coins in safe deposit, more than eight crore in business, and more than eight crore in interest. He kept land for farming that could be cultivated by 500 ploughs. He kept 500 carts for foreign trade and 500 carts for carrying loads. He renounced anything more than this. He also made a rule not to keep more than four large ships. In the seventh vow, the vow of consumption, he limited some of the things in the 26 categories as follows: 1. Clothing, except for fragrant kāṣāya-vastra (towel) for wiping the body, 2. Toothbrush, except for a green toothbrush from the mahūḍa tree, 3. Fruit, except for the āṁvala fruit, 4. Oil, except for sahasrapāka and śatpāka oil, 5. Applying anything to the body, except for gandhāḍhya, 6. Water for bathing, except for more than eight uṣṭrikās (large earthen pots), 7. Clothing, except for two cotton clothes, 8. Applying anything to the body, except for saffron, agarwood, and sandalwood, 9. Garlands of flowers, except for lotus flowers, 10.

The Story of Chulani Pita
From the Yogashastra, Third Illumination, Verse 86:
18. Except for tamarind and kokum, the renunciation of all other sour substances.
19. Except for rainwater, the renunciation of all other drinking water.
20. The renunciation of all mouth fresheners, except for the five types of aromatic substances used in paan.
After this, he renounced the five types of harmful activities: Arta-dhyana (sorrowful contemplation), Raudra-dhyana (wrathful contemplation), providing instruments for violence, indulgence in carelessness, and teaching or encouraging sinful deeds. He also accepted the four disciplinary vows. In this way, he properly and completely adopted the layman's vows, free from all transgressions, along with right faith, from Bhagavan Mahavira. After paying obeisance to the Bhagavan, he returned to his home. There, he also informed his religious wife about the layman's vows he had accepted. Desiring to adopt those layman's vows, his wife Shyama sought permission from her husband Chulani Pita. Obtaining her husband's permission, she immediately went to the religious chariot and, after paying reverence to the Lord, also accepted the vows of the layman's dharma.

After she left, Ganadhara Gautama Swami respectfully asked Bhagavan Mahavira, "Lord, will this Chulani Pita accept the ascetic dharma?" Bhagavan replied, "He will not accept the ascetic dharma. But, remaining devoted to the layman's dharma, upon the completion of his lifespan, he will die and be born in the Saudharma celestial realm. There, he will become a deity with a lifespan of four palya-prama. And from there, after falling, he will attain a human birth in the Mahavideha region and achieve the state of nirvana."

Towards the end of his life, Chulani Pita handed over the responsibility of his home and family to his eldest son and, renouncing everything, became absorbed in spiritual contemplation. Once, while observing the Poshada vow in the Poshada hall, a deceitful, false-believing deity came to him at night, with the intention of testing him. Assuming a terrifying form and holding a naked sword in his hand, the deity began to roar in a frightening voice, "O inauspicious beggar of a layman! What kind of pretense of religion have you kept up? I command you to abandon this hypocrisy of the layman's vows! If you do not give up this, I will cut your eldest son's head into pieces like a pumpkin with this sword. And right before your eyes, I will fry the pieces of his flesh in boiling oil and skewer them on a spit, and then I will drink his blood."

Even after hearing this terrifying challenge from the deity, Chulani Pita remained unmoved, just as a lion is not shaken by the rumbling and roaring of clouds. Seeing Chulani Pita's unwavering state, the cruel-souled deity repeatedly tried to frighten him by making terrifying gestures, but Chulani Pita did not even look at the deity, as if he were not even noticing a barking dog. Then, the merciless, cruel-hearted deity, in a contrived manner, slaughtered Chulani Pita's eldest son like an animal with the sword, and then cut him into pieces and threw them into a boiling oil pan. He also started roasting some of the pieces on a griddle. When they were cooked, he skewered them on sharp spits and began to eat them. The wise Chulani Pita endured all this torment with equanimity. Indeed, the souls rich in the sense of otherness do not feel the slightest pain even when their own limbs are cut off.

Seeing that Chulani Pita was not disturbed at all by his attempts, the deity tried another ploy. Threatening him, the deity said, "Look! If you still do not give up this hypocrisy of the vow, then I will also destroy your middle son in the same way as your eldest." Saying this, he slaughtered the middle son as well, and repeatedly laughed cruelly in front of Chulani Pita. But even this did not agitate Chulani Pita. Then, grinding his teeth, the deity repeated his words and also killed Chulani Pita's youngest son. Yet, seeing Chulani Pita's unwavering state, the deity's anger doubled. Challenging him again, the deity said, "O hypocrite of religion! If you still do not give up your hypocrisy, then see! I will do the same to your mother Bhadra as well." Then, he created an exact replica of Chulani Pita's mother, Bhadra, depicting her as afflicted, wretched, and tear-stained, like a pitiful doe, and said, "Give up this vow! This vow has brought the death warrant for your family!"

## The Nature and Method of the Atithisambhaag Vrat

**The Story of Chulani Pita**

"I have thrown your three sons into the jaws of death right before your eyes. Even then, if you do not give up your stubbornness, I will kill your mother, the Devaguru-like foundation of your lineage, and roast and cook her flesh and eat it. This is my final warning." But even after seeing Chulani Pita terrified, the Devata dragged Bhadra by her hair and showed her a scene like a goat trembling and screaming loudly when it sees a butcher with a knife in his hand in the slaughterhouse. The Devata was standing with a sword in his hand, ready to kill Bhadra, and she was crying and screaming in heart-wrenching agony. With this pitiful scene, the Devata again said to Chulani Pita, "Oh, selfish glutton! Look at the state of your mother! The one who gave birth to you, carried you in her womb, and bore your weight. That mother is being killed today, and you are sitting here being selfish!" Chulani Pita thought to himself, "This is some evil spirit like an Asura who is religiously devoted to evil. He has already killed and eaten my three sons, and now he is ready to kill my mother like a butcher. So, it is better to save my mother before he kills her." With this thought, driven by his vow, Chulani Pita got up to catch the Devata and roared loudly. Seeing this, the Devata became invisible and flew into the sky, making a great sound. After the Devata left, there was silence. But hearing the commotion, Bhadra Mata immediately ran there and asked, "Son! What was that? Why were you shouting so loudly?" Chulani Pita narrated the whole incident. Hearing this, Bhadra Mata said, "Son! This was Devmaya! Some Mithyadrishtidev came to break your vow by showing you false fear. He has succeeded in his mission. Therefore, you should criticize the breaking of your vow and purify yourself by performing penance. If the breaking of the vow is not criticized, the vow becomes impure due to transgression." Then, the pure-minded and non-greedy Chulani Pita accepted his mother's words and purified himself by criticizing the fault of breaking the vow. Then, like climbing the steps of the palace of heaven, he gradually accepted eleven Shravak pratima (images). And according to the words of the Bhagwan, he worshipped those eleven pratima with unwavering intensity and strictness for a long time. Afterwards, the wise Shravak took a lifelong fast with Sanlekhana, which he followed according to the method of worship and left his body with Samadhi-maran. From there, after death, Chulani Pita became a Devata named Arunaprab in the first Devalok. Just as Chulani Pita worshipped the difficult-to-achieve vow of Paushdha, so too, anyone who performs any other worship or practice will surely become a steadfast Shravak and be eligible for liberation. This is the example of Chulani Pita's vow-steadfastness!

**Atithisambhaag Vrat**

Now, regarding the fourth Shiksha Vrat called Atithisambhaag, it is said:

**Verse 87:**

"Giving four types of food, clothing, vessels, and houses to the Sadhus and Sadhvis is called the fourth Shiksha Vrat, Atithisambhaag."

**Explanation:**

Atithi means one whose arrival has no fixed date, whose festivals or celebrations are not fixed. Such excellent Atithi are the Sadhus and Sadhvis. To share with them, that is, when they come for alms during mealtime, to give them from the four types of food that you have prepared for yourself, such as food, drink, edibles, and delicacies, to give them vessels made of clay or wood, clothing or blankets to wear, and a house to live in, and by implication, a mat, a rug, a stool, a bed, etc., is the Atithisambhaag Vrat. This prohibits giving gold, etc., because Sadhus are not allowed to keep it. In fact, giving such excellent and deserving people what they need is called the Atithisambhaag Vrat. According to the etymology of Atithisambhaag Vrat, it means this: Atithi means one who has no fixed date, day, festival, or celebration. Such fortunate recipients of charity are called Atithi - Sadhus and Sadhvis. Sambhaag means Samyak prakar = free from the 42 faults like Aadhkarma, etc., and Vi means special type.

Giving and receiving clothes, utensils, and shelter, like food, to sadhus and sadhvis is important. This is explained in the Yoga Shastra, Third Light, verse 87, and in the section on "post-karma" and other defects. It means giving a portion of what is due, i.e., the things that should be given, without any defects. This is the meaning of the entire section on "Atithi-Sanvibhagat" - it is a vow-rule to give a suitable portion of your food, water, clothes, utensils, etc., to sadhus and sadhvis as a pure offering, provided that the food, water, etc., are justly earned, are not "achitt" or "prasook" (not obtained by improper means), are free from defects, are suitable for the sadhu, and are given with respect, in the right place and time, with faith, and with the understanding that it is for the benefit of both oneself and the soul. It is also said: "Giving food, water, etc., that is justly earned and suitable for the sadhu, with respect, in the right place and time, with faith, and with the understanding that it is for the benefit of both oneself and the soul, is "Atithi-Sanvibhagat." There are four things to consider in giving (Sanvibhagat): the method, the object, the giver, and the receiver.

The receiver - the sadhu community is the best receiver, they are those who live by begging, who are restrained, they are the best receivers.

The giver - 16 of the 42 defects of giving offerings are related to the giver. A pure giver is one who does not prepare, cook, or buy anything for the sake of purity, out of sentimentality, or for any other reason. The giver should not have any worldly or material desire, name, or self-interest in giving offerings to the sadhu. The giver should not give out of competition with anyone. The giver should not give out of shame, out of seeing others give, or out of dislike, but should give with sincere faith and devotion.

The object - the object that is given is considered pure if it is "prasook," "achitt," suitable for the sadhu, and "eshniya" (free from defects). It should be something that is prescribed in the scriptures for the sadhu community as a means of religious practice, or it should be food that is acceptable to the sadhu.

The method - the method of giving offerings should also be free from defects. The offerings should be given to the sadhu community in accordance with their own rules of conduct, free from the 42 defects of food, etc. Only then can the offering be conducive to restraint and bring all prosperity. Otherwise, offerings given or received in the wrong way will destroy the brilliance of the monk.

Those who are fortunate and blessed are those who respect the sadhu community and give them food, drink, delicious food, all kinds of food, clothes that are beneficial for their restraint, utensils, blankets, mats, places to live, beds, and other means of increasing restraint, with great joy. Those who follow the teachings of Jinendra Bhagwan should give to sadhus and sadhvis, according to their ability, even a small amount of what is suitable for them, free from defects. And they should never use for themselves what they have not given to them. If they are not very wealthy, they should still give a small amount of their own living space, mats, beds, food, water, medicine, clothes, utensils, etc., to sadhus and sadhvis.

The great sage Umaswati Maharaj, in the "Prashmarati-Prakarana," verses 145-146, says: "Any object, such as food, bed, clothes, utensils, and medicine, that is pure and suitable, can become unsuitable due to some reason, and what is unsuitable can become suitable due to some reason. An object can become suitable or unsuitable depending on the place, time, person, situation, the giver (consumer), and the pure result. No object is inherently suitable or unsuitable.

There is a doubt here: the scriptures mention the name of the food-giver, and it is also heard, but the name of the giver of clothes, etc., is not mentioned, nor is it heard, so how is it proper to give clothes, etc.? In response to this, it is said: this is not true. The giving of clothes, etc., is clearly stated in the Bhagavati Sutra, etc. The passage is as follows: "The householder, who is a follower of the Shramanas, lives by giving the Shramanas, who are Nigranthas, pure (prasook), free from defects (eshniya), food, drink, delicious food, and all kinds of food, clothes, utensils, blankets, mats, beds, and other things that are beneficial for their restraint, and thus gains benefit." Therefore, just as food and water are given, so also should things that are beneficial for restraint be given to sadhus and sadhvis.

Giving and receiving food, vessels, and shelter to sadhus and sadhvis is important, as explained in the Yoga Shastra, Third Light, verse 87, the foundation pillar. Clothes and other things that benefit the body should be given to sadhus. For the purpose of consuming grass (filling the stomach), to prevent the consumption of fire (instead of using fire for warmth), for the practice of Dharma and Shukla meditation, to alleviate the suffering of a sick sadhu, to dispose of a deceased sadhu, and so on, clothes are helpful and beneficial in observing restraint. The same is said elsewhere. The learned scholar, Shri Umaswati, has also said, "Without clothes, a sadhak is disturbed by cold, wind, sun, dust, mosquitoes, etc., which leads to distractions in their samyaktva and samyak meditation." For these and similar reasons, vessels are also considered useful. They are helpful in bringing food as alms, separating impure food from alms, preventing the killing of living beings by avoiding food containing them, and safely and easily collecting and disposing of spoiled rice or water that may accidentally be included in alms. It is also said that Jinendra Bhagwan instructed the use of vessels to protect the six-bodied beings, and they should be used to prevent food and water from falling and causing harm to living beings. The service of food, water, etc., to the sick, children, elderly, new sadhus, those who wear clothes, the great gurus, those who are intolerant, those who live alone, and those who are without attainment, can only be done if they have vessels. (O. Ni. 691-92) Because there is no restraint involved in bringing food and other things in a vessel.

Here, the question arises: It is not heard that the Tirthankaras used clothes or vessels, so shouldn't their followers follow their character? It is also said, "Jarisan Guruling Sissen Vi Tarisen Hoyavvan," meaning the disciple should follow the conduct of the guru. In response, it is said that the hands of the Tirthankaras are free from holes, and not even a drop of water falls from them. Instead, their hair rises high, reaching the sun and moon. They, with the power of their four or five knowledges, know perfectly well whether the food is contaminated with living beings or not, and whether the water contains living beings or not, and they only consume what is pure. Therefore, it is not beneficial for them to use vessels. It is said that all Tirthankaras wear clothes during their initiation. All twenty-four Tirthankaras take initiation with one devadusya, which does not categorize them as belonging to another linga, the householder linga, or the kula linga. (A. Ni. 217) The great sages have said that all the Tirthankaras who have been in the past, who will be in the future, and who are currently wandering, all preach the Dharma with clothes and vessels, and they all take initiation wearing one devadusya cloth. I worship all of them who have taken initiation, who will take initiation, and who have taken initiation. After taking initiation, they endure all the hardships and afflictions, so they no longer need clothes. If their clothes are lost somehow, they do not take them again. The statement that a disciple should follow the conduct of the guru should be understood in this context. It is like a common elephant imitating the Airavata elephant. A sadhak who wants to imitate the Tirthankaras cannot live in a monastery, residence, or shelter, cannot consume food that is partially cooked due to circumstances, cannot get an oil massage when sick, cannot use a grass mat or keep grass, cannot keep a kamandal, cannot live with many sadhus, cannot preach while being a recluse, and cannot initiate sadhus and sadhvis (make disciples). Because the Tirthankaras stay away from all these things. But those so-called sadhus who want to imitate the Tirthankaras do all these things.

During the rainy season, if a sadhu goes outside to a field or somewhere else, and it starts raining, a blanket is necessary to protect aquatic living beings. If a young, old, or sick sadhu has to go out for alms during the rainy season, wearing a blanket on their body prevents the killing of aquatic living beings. If they have to go outside during the rainy season for urination or defecation, wearing a blanket prevents the killing of aquatic living beings. Here, the question arises: If they don't wear a blanket and use an umbrella to cover themselves while walking in the rain, what is the fault? The solution is given in the Agam scripture, "Chattass Dharanattha" (Das. 3/4), which states that using an umbrella is inappropriate.

The method of offering food to the श्रमणोपासक
The third light of Yoga Shastra, verse 87, states that it is forbidden. Rajoharan is useful for the direct protection of life, so there is no dispute about keeping it. Mukhavastrika, or 'muhpatti', is also useful for protecting against flying (sampaatim) creatures, for protecting external air-bodied creatures from the hot air coming out of the mouth, and for preventing the entry of dust particles, etc. into the mouth. The mat and the stool are useful because it is forbidden to sleep on the ground during the rainy season, which is full of नीलण-फूलण, कुंथुआ, etc. Therefore, it is useful to sleep or sit on a mat or stool. The bedspreads, etc., are useful for sleeping in the cold and hot seasons. Residence in a dwelling (house) or shelter, etc., is also very beneficial for the restraint of the sadhu. "Whoever gives a house (dwelling), shelter, etc., to the fortunate, multi-virtuous Muni, understand that he has given everything, food, water, clothes, bedding, seat, etc. Where all the Munis use that dwelling (house), in that shelter, there is protection of oneself and one's character, and the practice of knowledge, meditation, etc., is easy. Therefore, it is believed that the giver of the dwelling (house) has given everything. He who protects the Munis from cold, heat, thieves, dance, mosquitoes, rain, etc., attains heavenly bliss. In this way, there is no fault in the Munis keeping other, more and auxiliary religious articles. The giver alone benefits. The number-limit of the instruments is stated: "Twelve types of instruments are allowed for the Jinakalp, fourteen types for the sthavirakalp Muni, and twenty-five types for the Arya (sadhvi). Keeping more than this is called an auxiliary. (O. Ni. 671) All this should be known from the Agamas like Pindaniyukti and Aghananiyukti. Here, for fear of the text becoming lengthy, we stop the pen by saying so much."
Here, the elders (sthaviras) state the Samachari (the code of conduct for the Shravak): "Before the Shravaks take the parana (complete) after taking the poshadh, if the sadhu-sadhvi are present, they should be invited first and then the food should be offered. The method is that when it is time for your meal, you should be well-dressed and go to the shelter and request the sadhus to benefit from the food and water. What is the limit of the sadhu at that time? It is stated: One sadhu should quickly take the palle (padle), another the mukhavastrika, and the third should quickly take the vessels; so that the poshadhopavashi Shravak does not have to delay or obstruct the parana. Or, take care that no establishment fault is incurred due to the sadhus. If the Shravak requests food in the first watch (paursi) and the sadhu refuses till the naukarsi, then take the food. If the sadhu does not refuse till the naukarsi, but does refuse till the paursi, then do not take it; because that food will have to be kept. If the Shravak requests very strongly, then take the food, bring it to the place, keep it well, and give that food to the sadhu who is going to take the parana as soon as the paursi (one watch) refusal is complete, or give it to another sadhu. Before the sadhu goes for alms, he should take the vessels, palle, etc. At least two sadhus should go for alms; it is not proper for a single sadhu to go for alms. On the way, the Shravak should walk ahead of the sadhu; and he should take the sadhu to his house. There, he should request the sadhus to take a seat; if they sit, it is good, if they do not sit, then one should know and practice the conduct of humility. When the sadhu Muni comes to the house, the Shravak should himself offer them food and water with his own hands and benefit from it. If someone else is offering food in the house, then stand with the food vessel until the Gurudev takes the food. The sadhu should also take care that there is no fault in the aftermath of the alms, i.e., no fault later, so he should not take all the food in the householder's vessel; he should leave some behind. After that, he should bow to the Gurus, walk with them for a few steps, take them to their destination, and then eat himself. If there is no yoga of the sadhu Muni in that village, then at the time of eating, look in the direction of the arrival of the sadhu Muni and think with pure intention that 'If the sadhu Bhagvant were here, I would be fulfilled by offering them food.' This is the method of taking the poshadh (complete). Even if the poshadh has not been taken, the knowledgeable Shravak-Shravika gives something or the other to the sadhu-sadhvi every day and then eats. Or, they give alms even after eating. There are some verses in this regard, the meaning of which is presented here.

The Importance of Giving Food and Other Donations to Shramanopasakas (Jain Ascetics)

Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 87: It is said that for Shramanopasakas, only those things that are suitable for Sadhus and Sadhvis and that are helpful for Dharma, restraint, and self-control should be given as donations, such as food, clothing, and water. Gold, silver, and other things that are not helpful for Dharma, which increase lust, anger, greed, ego, and destroy character, should never be given to Sadhus and Sadhvis. Compassionate people do not praise the donation of land that results in the destruction of many living beings. Why would a Shravak donate iron in the form of weapons that cause great violence? Who would be happy with the donation of sesame seeds, in which countless unconscious and suffering living beings are constantly born and die? Alas, on the occasion of worldly festivals, those who donate a pregnant cow that is about to die, seeking to earn merit, are called religious. Those who consider the cow, whose anus is considered to be a place of pilgrimage and who eats impure substances from her mouth, to be supremely holy, donate cows for the sake of religion. What merit will be gained by donating a cow whose calf suffers greatly when she is milked and who destroys animals with her hooves? What fruit will be obtained by those who donate golden, silver, sesame, and ghee cows? A daughter, who is like a fire that burns the tree of brotherly love, which creates attachment, is like the key to the door of hell, like the bolt on the door of liberation, who steals religious wealth and brings misfortune, is given in marriage, and it is said that this daughter donation is for the sake of welfare. Is this a scripture? At the time of marriage, foolish people give clothes, ornaments, etc., as donations to the bride and groom, not from the perspective of worldly love, but from the perspective of Dharma. Should these be considered to be Dharma-enhancing? In reality, such a donation made with Dharma-consciousness should be considered like pouring ghee into ashes. Those who, on the occasion of festivals like Sankranti, Vyatipat, Vaidhriti, Purnima, Amavasya, etc., fill their stomachs and are greedy, and who extort donations from their emotional patrons, are simply engaged in a business of cheating innocent people. Those who, with a dull mind, donate in the name of their deceased relatives, seeking to satisfy them, are like watering a dry tree with the hope that new leaves will sprout. If feeding Brahmanas in this world satisfies the ancestors in the afterlife, then why doesn't eating one person's food satisfy or nourish another? If the donation given by a son liberates his deceased father, then the son should perform austerities, and as a result, his father should also be liberated. If donating to the Ganges River or Gaya and other pilgrimage sites liberates ancestors, then one should water a withered tree to make green leaves sprout. In this world, one should not give anything to a beggar, who is a slave to his past karma, with the idea of Dharma or merit. In reality, merit or Dharma comes from donating things that are character-enhancing and conducive to self-control to such a renunciant.

And merit or fortune must be strong, only then will someone receive something. If there is no merit, then asking or begging from anyone is in vain. It is a great wonder that by making an idol of gold or silver and making a vow, that deity will protect you. Because when the moments of life are complete, no deity can protect anyone. Whether it is a big bull or a big goat, if you give it to a meat-eating Shrotriya Brahmana, then both the giver and the receiver will fall into the hellish abyss. A donor who gives with Dharma-consciousness, not knowing, may not be entangled in that sin, but the meat-eating receiver, knowing the fault, is certainly entangled in that sin. He who nourishes the worthy by killing the unworthy is like one who pleases a serpent by killing many frogs. The Jineshwars say that one should not give gold, etc., to renunciant men. Therefore, a wise and intelligent person should give only the appropriate food, etc., as a donation to the worthy.

Those who are adorned with the three jewels of knowledge, vision, and character, who are the guardians of the five committees and the three secrets, who are capable of bearing the burden of the great vow, who have conquered the enemy forces of the obstacles and the hardships, who are great warriors, Sadhus and Sadhvis, who do not even have attachment to their own bodies, how can they have attachment to other things? Renouncing all possessions except those that are helpful for Dharma, living on alms, free from the 42 faults, taking food only to sustain the body for the journey of Dharma, practicing celibacy, these are the ones who are worthy of receiving donations.

Giving to the worthy and highly worthy, excluding the unworthy and the highly unworthy, is successful and fruitful. According to Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 87, those adorned with good qualities, who do not even desire a straw-like object for cleaning their teeth; who are equanimous in honor and dishonor, profit and loss, pleasure and pain, censure and praise, joy and sorrow; who are free from the three types of actions, namely, doing, causing to be done, and approval, from the very beginning; who are solely desirous of liberation; and who are restrained, virtuous, and holy, are the most excellent and highly worthy. Those who possess the twelve vows, including Right Faith, or those who possess fewer vows, who are free from attachment to the world, and who are desirous of attaining the virtuous path, are considered to be moderately worthy householders. And those who possess only Right Faith, who are unable to observe other vows or to practice celibacy, and who are striving to perform pilgrimages, are considered to be the least worthy. Those who are devoid of possessions due to the detachment arising from listening to the scriptures; who are lovers of celibacy; who are far removed from sins such as theft, falsehood, violence, etc.; who are keepers of their vows; who are silent; who are eaters of roots, fruits, and grains; who are beggars; who live by collecting grains that have fallen on the ground or in the fields; who are eaters of leaves; who wear saffron-colored clothes or are naked; who have a tuft of hair or matted hair; who have shaved heads; who carry a single staff or three staffs; who live in monasteries or forests; who practice the five fires in summer; who consume cold things in winter; who smear ashes on their bodies; who wear ornaments made of skulls or bones, etc.; who are protectors of religion according to their understanding, but who are contaminated by false doctrines, who are haters of Jainism, who are devoid of wisdom, and who are followers of false religions, are considered to be unworthy. Those who are eager to kill living beings; who are liars; who steal the property of others; who are immersed in strong sexual desires like a donkey; who are constantly engaged in acquiring possessions day and night; who never possess contentment; who are meat-eaters; who are drunkards; who are excessively angry; who take pleasure in fighting and causing others to fight; who are merely readers of scriptures; who are always engrossed in the thoughts of scholars; and who are atheists in reality, are considered to be highly unworthy. Thus, excluding the unworthy and the highly unworthy, those who are desirous of liberation, wise, and discerning, tend to give to the worthy. Giving to the worthy makes the donation successful, while giving to the unworthy or highly unworthy does not make the donation successful. Giving to the worthy is a cause for the increase of virtue, while giving to the unworthy is a cause for the increase of vice. Just as feeding milk to a snake is like increasing poison, so too, giving to the unworthy is like increasing rebirth. Just as sweet milk poured into a bitter gourd becomes contaminated and unfit for drinking, so too, the donation given to the unworthy or highly unworthy becomes contaminated. Even if the entire earth is given as a donation to the unworthy or highly unworthy, it will not be fruitful. On the contrary, even a small amount of food given with faith to the worthy will be highly fruitful. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the worthy and the unworthy in the matter of donations that lead to liberation. However, the knowers of truth have never prohibited compassion or giving. The worthy and the donation, pure and impure; thus, when considering these four possibilities, the first possibility (both the worthy and the donation are pure) is pure. The second possibility (the worthy is pure, but the donation is impure) is semi-pure. The third possibility (the worthy is impure, but the donation is pure) is also semi-pure. And the fourth possibility (both the worthy and the donation are impure) is completely impure. In reality, except for the first possibility, the remaining three possibilities are, in a way, thoughtless and fruitless. Giving leads to the attainment of enjoyments; this possibility is also thoughtless, being a symbol of impure donation. Although the fruit of a donation given to a worthy person is the attainment of pure enjoyments, it is pure because it is not a donation given with the desire to attain enjoyments. And truly, how insignificant and small is the fruit of a donation in the form of the attainment of enjoyments! The main and great fruit of a pure donation is the attainment of liberation. Just as the main fruit of farming is the attainment of grain, and the fruit in the form of the attainment of grass is incidental and small; so too, the main fruit of a pure donation given to the worthy is the attainment of liberation, and the fruit in the form of the attainment of enjoyments is small and incidental. Through this pure act of giving, the wealthy merchant, in the first birth of the first Tirthankara, attained Right Faith (the seed of enlightenment) and the great fruit of liberation in this very life. When the Tirthankara Rishabhadeva was given alms in the royal palace on the first day of his renunciation, the gods were pleased and immediately showered flowers and declared, "Oh, what a donation!" We have already spoken extensively about the division of guests in the Atithisambhagavat. Therefore, one should give appropriate donations after discerning what is to be given and what is not to be given, who is worthy and who is not worthy. || 87 || Although wise and faithful people attain the fruit of liberation directly or through tradition by giving to the highly worthy, giving to the worthy is beneficial for all virtuous beings in every way. From this perspective, we describe the incidental fruit of giving to the worthy.

Explanation: - The word 'Behold' is used here to bring the noble ones in front of the donation. Sangama, the cowherd, by the influence of giving to the Muni, obtained miraculous wealth that amazed everyone. Although Sangama is traditionally destined for liberation, the mention of liberation is not made here because the relevant fruit is being described. Sangama's character is known from the tradition of the sect; it is as follows:
Sangama, the giver of donations to the deserving with faith:
In the Magadha country, in the city of Rajgriha, which was like the ancestral home of Lakshmi, shining with various jewels, in those days, the reign of Emperor Shrenik was accepted by various kings, like the reign of Indra. In the Rajgriha block, in the village of Shali, there lived a wealthy woman named Dhanya, with a small family. Due to misfortune and the separation from her loved ones, she came to Rajgriha with her only son, Sangama. While living in Rajgriha, Sangama earned his living by grazing the calves of some citizens. 'This is the appropriate and sattvic livelihood for a poor child.' Dhanya earned some money by doing small household chores for the wealthy people around. Thus, both mother and son were living happily. Once, on the day of a festival, seeing kheer being made in everyone's house, the boy Sangama also asked his mother for kheer. The mother said - Son! We are very poor, where can we get kheer from? But the child did not understand this and started to fuss about eating kheer. Remembering her old wealth and the duty of a mother towards her son, Dhanya started sobbing loudly. Hearing her heart-wrenching, sorrowful cry, the women from the wealthy houses nearby rushed over and asked her the reason for crying and being so sad. At first, she did not tell clearly due to shyness, but later, at the insistence of the noble women, Dhanya told her story and her plight in a choked voice. So that her self-respect was not hurt, the noble women together respectfully gave her milk, rice, sugar, etc., all the ingredients for making kheer. Dhanya happily made kheer and served it in a plate for Sangama and told him to eat it after it cooled down, and she went out for some work. The boy was cooling the kheer in the plate, at that time, a Mahamauni, who was a Masik (one who observed a fast for a month), came to take alms for his parana, like a boat in the ocean of the world, to cross it. Seeing the Muni, the boy Sangama was greatly impressed. He thought - Oh! This is a conscious Chintamani jewel, or a moving Kalpavriksha, or a Kamdhenu devoid of animal instincts? It is by my good fortune that this supreme Muni has arrived today! Otherwise, how could such a noble soul come to the house of a poor person like me? It is only due to the fruit of some strong punya of mine that this confluence of mind, attitude, and worthy person has happened today? Thinking thus intensely, he quickly picked up the plate of kheer and poured all of it into the Muni's bowl. The Muni kept saying, 'Enough, enough', but the boy, with strong emotion, gave all the kheer, which he had obtained with great difficulty, to the ascetic Muni. The Mahakarunasheel Muni also accepted it in his alms bowl with a sense of gratitude and left after eating. Dhanya, after finishing the necessary work in the houses around, returned home and saw that the plate was empty, so she served more kheer in the plate, which Sangama quickly ate. Dhanya did not know that Sangama had given that kheer to the Muni. After eating the hot kheer, Sangama got indigestion and severe stomach pain at night, and as he remembered giving the donation to the Muni, his body left him. By the influence of the Muni-daan, Sangama's soul entered the womb of Bhadra, the wife of Seth Gobhadra, in the city of Rajgriha. Bhadra Sethani saw a field full of lush green paddy (grain) and ripe vines in her dream. She told her husband about the dream. When the Seth heard it, he was overjoyed and said - My dear! This auspicious dream is an indication of you having a son. After a few days, Bhadra Sethani gave birth to a son. 'May I perform acts of charity and righteousness many times.' The wise Gobhadra Seth also fulfilled his wish with joy. When the time was right, Bhadra, with her radiance, developed the face of a mother, just like that

From a worthy donation, the poor assembly of cowherds became the wealthy son of a merchant, Shalibhadra. 
The third light of the Yoga Shastra, verse 88, gave birth to a son like a mountain range gives birth to a vaidurya gem. In an auspicious time, the parents named their son Shalibhadra according to their dream. The child was raised under the care of five nurses. As the moon gradually grows, when the child was eight years old, his parents sent him to the art teacher to learn arts and sciences. When he reached the threshold of youth, Shalibhadra also became a lover of young women. Now Shalibhadra, playing with his friends, seemed like another Pradyumna Kumar. Many merchants of the city came and proposed their 32 daughters to Shalibhadra in front of the respected merchant, Gobhadra, and requested him to accept the proposal, which Gobhadra accepted with joy. After that, Gobhadra, in an auspicious time, married Shalibhadra with great pomp and show to those 32 daughters, who were endowed with all auspicious signs. After the marriage, Shalibhadra, enjoying with those 32 daughters in his beautiful palace, seemed as if Indra was enjoying with Shachi and others in his beautiful chariot. Immersed in the joy of that luxurious and alluring environment, Shalibhadra did not know when the sun rose and when the night passed! His parents themselves provided him with all the materials for enjoyment. When the time came, Gobhadra left his entire property, home, family, etc., and took monastic initiation at the feet of Lord Mahavira. While practicing self-restraint, knowing that his last moments were near, he took a vow of fasting and completed his life span through Samadhi-death and reached the heavenly abode. There, knowing Shalibhadra as his son through his knowledge of the past, attracted by his merit and filled with paternal affection, Gobhadra daily offered divine clothes, ornaments, etc., to him and his thirty-two wives. Whatever work was done for humans, was done by Bhadra Sethani. All this material for enjoyment was obtained due to the effect of his previous donations.
Once, some foreign merchants came to Rajgriha to sell gem-blankets. They showed these gem-blankets to King Shrenik, but he refused to buy them because they were very expensive. Disappointed, the merchants were returning when Shalibhadra's mother, Bhadra Sethani, called them to her place and bought all the gem-blankets at their asking price. When Queen Chillaana came to know that the king had not bought a single gem-blanket, she said to King Shrenik - My dear! Even if it is very expensive, you must buy at least one gem-blanket for me. Therefore, King Shrenik asked the merchants to give him one gem-blanket at the price he had previously mentioned. To this, the merchants said - O King! All the gem-blankets have been bought by Bhadra Sethani alone. We do not have a single gem-blanket left. King Shrenik sent a skilled servant to Bhadra Sethani to buy a gem-blanket for him by paying the price. He asked Bhadra Sethani for a gem-blanket at the price he had bought it for. To this, Bhadra Sethani said - I have broken the gem-blankets into halves and given them to my 32 daughters-in-law (Shalibhadra's wives). They must have thrown them away after wiping their feet with them. If the king needs them urgently, he can get the gem-blankets in the form of two used pieces. Therefore, if you want to take them after asking the king, you can take them. The servant went and told the whole story to King Shrenik. Queen Chillaana, who was sitting nearby, also heard this and said to him - My dear! Look! Isn't there a difference between brass and gold in us and Shalibhadra the merchant? King Shrenik was embarrassed to hear this. Out of curiosity, he sent that man to bring Shalibhadra. When the servant told Bhadra about this, she herself said that she would go to serve the king. Bhadra Sethani herself went to serve the king and politely requested - O King! My son is so delicate that he never goes out of the palace. Therefore, please grace us by coming here and seeing Shalibhadra. The surprised King Shrenik agreed to go to Shalibhadra's place. Bhadra requested the king to stay for some time. Coming home, she had the entire road from her house to the royal palace and the shops in the market decorated with colorful clothes and ruby gems by her servants. The shops looked as if they had been decorated by the gods themselves. Seeing the splendor of the highway and the market, King Shrenik reached Shalibhadra's place and, with eyes wide with wonder, looked at the amazing palace of Bhadra.

Immersed in the boundless ocean of pleasures, Shalibhadra, gazing at the splendor of renunciation, entered the path of Yoga Shastra. The palace was adorned with pillars of gold and a torana of Indranil gems. Its entrance was resplendent with a row of pearl swastikas. Its courtyard was intricately paved with the finest jewels. A canopy of divine fabrics was draped there. The entire palace was fragrant with the incense of aromatic substances. The palace seemed like another celestial abode on earth. 

Bhadhra, taking the king to his palace on the fourth floor, seated him on the throne, and then proceeded to Shalibhadra's palace on the seventh floor. She said to him, "Son! Shrenik has come to your place. Come down for a while to see him." Shalibhadra replied, "Mother! You know everything and buy whatever you like. What will I do by going there? If you like something, buy it, whatever the price, and have it stored." 

The mother, moved by affection, said, "Son! This is not something to be bought. This is the king of Rajgriha, who is the lord of you and me, everyone. He has come to meet you, so come." 

Hearing the word "lord" from his mother's mouth, an inner turmoil arose in Shalibhadra's emotional heart. "Is there a lord over my head too? As long as I remain enslaved to worldly objects, palaces, wives, and other material possessions, there will surely be a lord over my head. Curse me! Will I remain a slave to all these pleasures? How long will I keep a lord over my head? Am I not the master of the infinite power that lies within me, or can I not become one? My father, too, after being initiated into the feet of Lord Mahavira, awakened his infinite powers. I too, will soon renounce these terrible pleasures, like the fangs of a serpent, and become initiated into the feet of Lord Mahavira, becoming my own master, awakening the infinite power that sleeps within me." 

Thus, contemplating with emotion, Shalibhadra, under his mother's insistence, came to Shrenik with all his wives. He bowed to the king. Shrenik, upon seeing him, embraced Shalibhadra like a son, affectionately smelled his head, and seated him on his lap, stroking his head lovingly. 

Sitting in the king's lap, Shalibhadra felt the anxiety of a prisoner in a dungeon. His body began to sweat from the king's touch, and tears streamed from his eyes. Seeing this, Bhadhra said to the king, "Dev! Leave him now. Because, though a human, he is extremely delicate. He is so fragile that he cannot bear even the slightest rough touch, nor even the scent of a human garland." 

"His father, who has gone to the celestial realm, sends divine garments, ornaments, and perfumes from there for him and his wives every day." 

Hearing this, the king released Shalibhadra. He escaped from there and went straight to his palace on the seventh floor. Bhadhra requested Shrenik to have dinner at her place. Impressed by Bhadhra's hospitality and humility, the king accepted her request. Bhadhra ordered her servants and maids to prepare all kinds of the finest food immediately. What work of the wealthy is not accomplished by wealth? 

She ordered skilled servants to give him a massage with fragrant, fine oil mixed with scented powder, and then bathe him. While bathing, the king's ring fell into the water-playing vessel from his finger. The king began to search for it here and there. Seeing this situation, Bhadhra immediately ordered the maid to empty the water from that vessel into another. As the vessel emptied, the king's black, jet-black ring appeared along with other ornaments. Seeing this, the king was even more surprised. 

Astonished, the king asked the maid, "What is all this?" The maid replied respectfully, "Dev! Shalibhadra and his wives bathe and wear new ornaments every day, and they put the old ornaments in this." 

The king, overwhelmed with wonder, thought, "Shalibhadra is truly blessed. I am also blessed that there is such a fortunate person in my kingdom." 

Thereafter, the king, along with his family, had dinner there. Afterwards, Bhadhra, with great respect, presented the king with wonderful, shining garments, ornaments, etc., and bid him farewell. King Shrenik, deeply impressed, returned to his palace. 

1. The mention of the wife accompanying him is not found in other narratives.

## Dhanna-Shalibhadra Munis's Anashan and Mata Bhadra's Khed-Prakashan

**Yoga Shastra, Third Prakash, Shlok 88**

Shalibhadra, feeling detached, was contemplating leaving his home and family. During this time, a Dharmamitra (spiritual friend) came to him and humbly requested, "Surasuravandi, the very embodiment of Dharma, the possessor of the four knowledges, Dharmaghosh Muni, has arrived in the garden outside this city." Shalibhadra was overjoyed upon hearing this and boarded his chariot to go see him. He reached there and paid his respects to Acharya Dharmaghosh and the other Munis, then sat before them to listen to their teachings. After the teachings, Shalibhadra politely asked, "Bhagavan! What is the way to be free from having another master over my head?" Acharya Shri replied, "Muni Diksha is the only way to gain mastery over the entire world. Nath! If this is the case, then I will receive Muni Diksha after seeking permission from my mother." When Shalibhadra said this, Acharya Shri replied, "Then do not delay in this matter." Shalibhadra went straight home from there and, after paying his respects to his mother, said, "Mataji! Today, I heard Dharma, the way to liberation from the sorrows of the world, from the mouth of Dharmaghosh Acharya!" "Vats! You have purified your ears by listening to Dharma! You have done well. You are truly the son of such a righteous father." Thus, his mother praised him. Shalibhadra said to his mother, "Mataji! If this is true, and I am the son of such a righteous father, then please bless me so that I can receive Diksha and achieve self-welfare." His mother, impatient, said, "Putra! It is appropriate for you to follow the Shravak Vrat right now. Following the Mahavrat is like chewing iron chickpeas. Your body is still very delicate. You have been nurtured with divine food and resources. Just as a young calf cannot bear the weight of a chariot, you will not be able to bear the weight of restraint right now!" Shalibhadra politely replied, "Ma! If a man who can enjoy the pleasures of life cannot bear the hardship of Mahavrat, then there is no one more cowardly than him." His mother, affectionately, said, "Beta! For now, bear the fragrance of the garlands of the mortal world and practice giving up pleasures. Gradually, as you become strong through practice, then you can accept Muni Diksha." Shalibhadra, obeying his mother's words, began to give up one wife and one bed (bedding) every day.

In Rajgriha, Shalibhadra's younger sister Subhadra's husband, Dhanna, was a Sarthavaha (merchant). He was as wealthy as he was righteous. One day, Subhadra was bathing Dhanna when hot tears fell from her eyes onto his back. Dhanna was startled and exclaimed, "Priye! Why are there tears in your eyes today?" Subhadra, with a choked voice, said, "Prannath! My brother, with the desire to receive Muni Diksha from Bhagwan Mahavira, is giving up one wife and one bed every day. In 32 days, he will have given up all his wives and beds and become a Muni. In my parental home, a brother is the only support for his sister! Remembering him, my heart filled up and tears fell." Dhanna, mockingly, said, "Your brother is a coward, a fearful and weakling like a jackal, who is giving up things slowly like this. If he wants to accept Mahavrat, why doesn't he do it all in one day?" Subhadra said, "Priyatam! It is easy to say, but very difficult to do. If accepting Mahavrat is easy, then why don't you accept it?" Dhanna, in reply, said, "You were the obstacle in my accepting Mahavrat, that's why I couldn't do it until now. Now, by the grace of auspicious karma, you have encouraged me and given me permission. So, from today, you are like my sister, and I will immediately accept Diksha." Subhadra said, "Nath! I said that in jest. You took it seriously. Please, do not leave us and your cherished Lakshmi." But Dhanna was already touched by the color of restraint. He said, "This Lakshmi and woman are all impermanent. Therefore, I will definitely accept Diksha with the desire to attain the eternal state by giving them up." Saying this, Dhanna immediately got up. Subhadra and Dhanna's other wives said, "If that is the case, then we will also follow you and accept Diksha." The great-souled Dhanna, considering himself blessed, readily gave them permission. By chance, Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira, while wandering, arrived at Vaibhargiri in Rajgriha. Therefore, Dhanna's Dharmamitra gave him this news. Dhanna, donating his immense wealth, sat with his wives in a Shivika (palanquin) and reached the feet of Shri Mahavira Prabhu. Dhanna, filled with fear of birth and death, accepted Diksha along with his wives.

## Description of the Transgressions

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verses 88-89**

When Shalibhadra heard this, he was left behind, and began to hurry for initiation. As a result, the mighty Emperor Shrenik also approved of it. Therefore, Shalibhadra also took initiation at the lotus feet of Shri Veer Prabhu.

Just as the king of elephants roams with his herd, so too did Shri Veer Prabhu, the son of Siddhartha, roam from village to village with his disciples. Both Dhannah and Shalibhadra became learned scholars by studying the scriptures, and they also began to practice severe austerities. They were free from attachment to their bodies, and they practiced intense austerities for days, months, two months, three months, four months, and so on. Due to this intense austerity, their bodies became devoid of flesh and blood, and they were reduced to mere skeletons, like a mosquito.

While roaming, both the monks, along with Lord Mahavira, arrived at their birthplace, Rajgriha. Due to their unwavering faith in the Lord Mahavira, the Trilokinath, who was seated in the Samavasaran, many residents of the city flocked to see and worship him. Dhannah and Shalibhadra also received permission from the Lord to go for alms after breaking their monthly fast (Masakshapan). Shri Bhagwan said to Shalibhadra, "Today, you will break your fast with your mother's hand." Both Shalibhadra and Dhannah set out for food. Both the monks stood at the door of Bhadra's palace, but due to their emaciated bodies from austerity, no one recognized them. Bhadra was also eager to go and worship Shri Veer Prabhu, Dhannah, and Shalibhadra, so in her haste, she did not recognize them. Both the monks stood there for a while and then moved on. They were going through the street leading to the main gate of the city when Dhannya, Shalibhadra's mother from a previous birth, met him. As soon as she saw Shalibhadra, milk flowed from her breasts. She bowed to both the monks and gave them yogurt with devotion. Taking it, both the monks went to serve Lord Mahavira.

After bowing and paying respects, they criticized the Gauchari. Then, with folded hands, Shalibhadra asked, "O Bhagwan! You said that today I would break my fast with my mother's hand. How did that happen?" The omniscient Lord said, "O Shalibhadra, the great monk! Dhannya, who gave you yogurt, was your mother from a previous birth, and indeed from other births as well."

After breaking his fast with the yogurt given by Dhannya, Shalibhadra, the monk, received permission from Veer Prabhu to fast, and along with Dhannah, the monk, went to the Vaibhargiri mountain. There, both Dhannah and Shalibhadra performed the Prarmazan and Pratilekhan of a rock, and accepted the fast called Padupopgaman. During that time, Mother Bhadra and King Shrenik, along with others, arrived with devotion to see and worship Lord Mahavira. Mother Bhadra asked the Lord, "O Prabhu! Where are Dhannah, the monk, and Shalibhadra, the monk? Why did they not come to our place for alms?" The omniscient Lord said, "O Bhadra! Both the monks came to your house today, but you were eager to come here. Therefore, in your haste, you did not recognize them. Your son was met by his mother from a previous birth, Dhannya, on his way back. She gave him yogurt as alms. They both broke their fast with it. And both the great, powerful monks, following my command, have gone to Vaibhargiri to renounce their bodies in a state of Samadhi after fasting. They have accepted the fast there."

Hearing this, Bhadra went to Vaibhargiri with King Shrenik. There, they saw both the monks on a stone slab, like stone statues, in Kayotsarga meditation. Bhadra could barely see their bodies, which had become emaciated from austerity. Remembering their past prosperity, her heart filled with sorrow. With the echo of her weeping, as if making Vaibhargiri weep, Bhadra said with a choked voice, "O son! You came to my house today, but I, the unfortunate one, did not recognize you. Do not be angry with me for my mistake. Although you have renounced all types of food, it was my wish that you would delight my eyes with your sight. But, O son! You have begun this fast, which is the cause of the renunciation of the body, and you are trying to break my wish. I do not object to the austerity you have begun, but please move away from this extremely hard stone and come this way."

Seeing the power of Mother Bhadra's attachment, King Shrenik said to her, "Mother! Why do you weep in vain, instead of rejoicing? Such virtuous men, who are masters of austerity, 1. In other stories, the initiation of both is described together.

## Discussion on the Five Transgressions of the First Anuvrata

**Chapter 89-90 of the Third Light of Yoga Shastra**

You are being called the only fortunate mother with a son in the world, only because of your son. Your mighty son, understanding the essence of the world, renounced wealth as insignificant as a straw and attained the feet of the Lord, the embodiment of liberation. Being a disciple of the Lord of the Three Worlds, he is engaged in penance accordingly. You are needlessly grieving in your heart due to your feminine nature. Abandon this attachment and fulfill your duty. 

King Shrenik, having awakened the grieving mother Bhadra, returned home after she paid her respects to both the monks. Meanwhile, the monks Dhanananda and Shalibhadra, having completed their lifespan in samadhi, attained the celestial abode called Sarvarthasiddha, which is like thirty-three oceans, and became excellent gods. Thus, the Sangha obtained unique wealth that would grow in the future due to the worthy donation. Therefore, a virtuous person should always strive to follow the Atithisanvibhaga Vrata properly. || 88 ||

We have discussed the twelve Vratas. Now, to protect them from possible transgressions (faults), we will discuss the nature of transgressions and their types.

**Verse 89**

Vratas with transgressions do not lead to good deeds. Therefore, there are five transgressions for each Vrata, which should be abandoned. || 89 ||

**Explanation:**

Transgression means impurity or defect in a Vrata. Vrata practice with impurity (defect) does not lead to merit. Therefore, it is necessary to abandon the five transgressions of each Vrata. Here, a doubt is raised: "Transgressions occur only in Sarvavirati; it is only in Sarvavirati that transgressions arise from the emergence of Sanjwalana Kshaya!" In response, it is said: "It is true that all transgressions arise from the emergence of Sanjwalana Kshaya. In it, the first twelve Kshayas are eradicated from the root by their emergence (A. Ni. 112). And the emergence of Sanjwalana Kshaya occurs only in those who have the Sarvavirati Gunasthan; those who have the Deshavirati Gunasthan experience the emergence of Pratyakhyanavaraneya Kshaya. Therefore, transgressions are not possible in the Vratas of a Deshavirati Shravak. This is true from the perspective of the principles. Here, its absence is like the absence of a hole in the body of a lazy person. It happens in this way: In the first Anuvrata, the intention to kill gross beings is first abandoned, then the intention to kill the innocent, then the intention to kill in various ways, such as two ways, three ways, etc. Therefore, after giving a lot of leeway, when it becomes extremely subtle, due to the absence of Deshavirati, how can a transgression in the form of Deshavirati be imposed? Therefore, its complete abandonment is appropriate! Since Mahavrata is great, there is a possibility of transgressions in it. Transgressions in Mahavrata are like putting a bandage on a boil on an elephant's body. In response to this, it is said: "It is not appropriate to say that transgressions are not possible in the Deshavirati Gunasthan. The Upasakadasangasutra mentions five transgressions for each Vrata. Its divisions have also been mentioned. But it should not be said that there are no transgressions there. In the Agamas, both divisions and transgressions are considered separately. From this perspective, it is said that 'all transgressions arise from the emergence of Sanjwalana Kshaya.' This is true, but it is said in relation to the Sarvaviraticharitra, not in relation to Samyaktva and Deshaviraticharitra. Since all transgressions arise from the emergence of Sanjwalana, etc., the verse explains that transgressions occur in Sarvaviraticharitra due to the emergence of Sanjwalana Kshaya, while the emergence of the remaining twelve Kshayas leads to the destruction of the Mulavrata of Sarvavirati. From this perspective, there is no absence of transgressions in Deshaviraticharitra. || 89 ||

Therefore, the transgressions mentioned for the first Vrata are:

**Verse 90**

1. Binding a living being out of anger, 2. Cutting off its limb, 3. Imposing a burden beyond its strength, 4. Beating it with a whip, etc., without any fault, and 5. Stopping its food and drink, these five transgressions are mentioned for the Ahimsa Anuvrata. || 90 ||

English Translation (preserving Jain terms):

Description of the Five Transgressions of the First Anu Vrata
Explanation of Verse 90 from the Third Illumination of the Yogashastra:

These are the five transgressions of the first Anu Vrata of Ahimsa (non-violence):

1. Tightly binding animals like cows, buffaloes, etc. with ropes, etc. in a way that they cannot get free, and keeping them permanently under control. However, if one binds their son, etc. for the purpose of beneficial instruction or to restrain their unruliness, it is not a transgression, because the word 'krodhat' (out of anger) in the original verse indicates that binding done out of the arising of extremely strong passions is the first transgression.

2. Cutting off the limbs or skin of someone out of anger or hatred, such as cutting off a person's or animal's hand, foot, head, etc. or piercing them with a knife, is the second transgression.

3. Loading an excessive burden on the shoulders, back or head of animals like cows, bulls, camels, donkeys, or humans, more than they can easily carry or pull, is the third transgression.

4. Beating or hitting any innocent animal or person with a stick, rod, whip or any weapon, or sawing with an iron saw, throwing stones, etc. out of anger or hatred, falls under the fourth transgression.

5. Withholding food, water or fodder from any animal or person out of anger, hatred, etc. is the fifth transgression.

The Aavashyaka Churni has described the rules regarding binding. Binding of two-legged beings (humans) and four-legged animals can be of two types - meaningful and meaningless. Meaningless binding is never appropriate. Meaningful binding is also of two types - relative and absolute. Absolute binding is to be avoided.

Relative binding is when binding is not done out of passions, but even an innocent one has to be bound with ropes, etc. However, the knot should not be tied too tightly, but loosely, so that it can be easily opened or cut when the time comes. Absolute binding is when the knot is tied extremely tightly and firmly, so that it cannot be opened even in times of calamity. Sometimes the knot is tied so firmly that the poor animal cannot break free even if a fire breaks out, and it ends up burning to death there.

Among two-legged beings (humans), slaves, thieves, lazy students, etc. may be bound for the purpose of beneficial instruction, so that the binding can be easily removed when the time comes. But in absolute binding, no such consideration is made. Therefore, whether it is a two-legged (human) or four-legged (animal) being, absolute binding is to be avoided in all circumstances, while relative binding is pardonable.

In fact, we should habituate animals and humans to live in such places where they can stay without any binding. Amputation or cutting of skin should also be understood as relative and absolute. Ruthlessly cutting off someone's limbs, hands, feet, nose, etc. or gouging out their eyes is absolute amputation, which is not good. But if there is a boil or abscess on the body, and it needs to be lanced or the affected part burned for treatment, that is relative amputation.

Overloading is also not right from the perspective of non-violence. Ideally, the Shravaka (lay follower) should give up using carts or mounts with two-legged or four-legged beings. If there is no other livelihood, only as much load should be placed on humans as they can easily carry themselves. For four-legged animals like oxen, only as much weight should be loaded in the plow, cart, chariot, etc. as they can easily carry or pull, and they should also be released on time.

Similarly, there are two types of beating - relative and absolute. If an uncivil, unruly or criminal person needs to be punished, it should not be done out of cruelty or hatred, but by showing them a stick or giving them a mild beating, as appropriate, to put them back on the right path. In relative beating, if one has to beat their son, etc. for not obeying or being unruly, they should avoid the vital parts and, with compassion in the heart, give them a light kick, punch or slap once or twice. Beating the vital parts out of cruelty, hatred or anger is absolute beating, which is not appropriate.

Withholding food and water also has four types - meaningful, meaningless, relative and absolute. Completely cutting off someone's food and drink can sometimes lead them to die of hunger and thirst, suffering anguished meditation. Therefore, in the case of an enemy or criminal, one should not completely deprive them, but provide them with the minimum necessary.

## Discussion on the Five Transgressions of the Second Anuvrata

**This section discusses the five transgressions of the second Anuvrata, which is the vow of truthfulness (Satya).**

**The text refers to the third light of Yoga Shastra, verses 91 to 91, which states that one should not engage in meaningless restrictions like fasting, etc. However, if someone is ill or needs to abstain from food due to a medical condition, then it is meaningful and relative restriction for that period only.**

**The text then discusses the concept of "binding" or "restraining" dependent beings. It states that one should feed the dependent being first before eating oneself. If someone has committed a transgression, they should be reprimanded only verbally, saying "You will not receive food today."**

**The text then discusses the concept of fasting for the sake of healing or other purposes. It states that a Shravak (Jain lay follower) can fast for such purposes. The text emphasizes that a Shravak should be mindful and avoid transgressions against the fundamental principle of non-violence (Ahimsa).**

**The text then addresses a potential doubt: "Since a Shravak only has the rule of non-violence (killing), there is no fault in binding or restraining others."**

**The text clarifies that if someone has taken the vow of non-violence and then engages in binding or restraining others, it constitutes a violation of the vow, as it breaks the continuity of non-violence. Similarly, if someone has renounced the vow of non-violence, then any transgression against any vow is considered a transgression. However, there is no transgression in binding or restraining others.**

**The text explains that while binding or restraining others may not be a direct violation of the vow of non-violence, it is considered a transgression because it is a means to violence. It further explains that there are two ways in which a vow can be violated: internally and externally.**

**The text states that if someone gets angry or expresses anger without intending to harm another, it is not considered a violation of the vow of non-violence. Similarly, if someone engages in binding or restraining others without any malice or intention to harm, it is not considered violence. However, if the action is motivated by cruelty or a lack of compassion, it constitutes an internal violation of the vow. Since there is no violence involved, it is considered an external observance of the vow. However, the action is still considered a transgression due to the internal violation.**

**The text then quotes a verse: "Who would consider it a transgression to have taken the vow of 'I will not kill' if no one dies?"**

**The text explains that if someone kills another being out of anger or cruelty, and does not adhere to their vow, then it is considered a complete violation of the vow. Even if the death of the other being does not occur, the vow is still violated due to the anger or cruelty involved. The text states that the revered ones have termed this as a partial violation and partial observance of the vow.**

**The text then refutes the claim that binding or restraining others violates the vow of non-violence. It states that binding or restraining others is a transgression against the principle of pure non-violence.**

**The text concludes by stating that binding or restraining others can also lead to other transgressions, such as killing, expulsion, enchantment, and other forms of magic.**

**The text then moves on to discuss the five transgressions of the second vow, which is the vow of truthfulness (Satya).**

**The five transgressions are:**

1. **Giving false advice (Mithyopadesh):** Giving advice that is contrary to the principles of restraint or Dharma (righteousness) and promotes sin.
2. **Accusing someone without proper consideration (Sahsa Abhyakhyan):** Accusing someone without proper investigation or evidence.
3. **Revealing someone's secret or private matters (Guhya Bhashan):** Disclosing someone's confidential information.
4. **Breaking a trust by revealing a secret entrusted to you (Vishwastha Mantra Bhed):** Betraying someone's trust by revealing a secret they shared with you.
5. **Creating false documents or records (Kuta Lekh):** Creating false documents, accounts, or writings.

**The text explains that these five transgressions are considered violations of the vow of truthfulness.**

**The text then provides further explanation of each transgression.**

1. **False advice (Mithyopadesh):** Giving false advice is considered a violation of the vow of truthfulness because it involves speaking words that are harmful to others. For example, telling someone to beat an animal or to steal.
2. **Accusing someone without proper consideration (Sahsa Abhyakhyan):** Accusing someone without proper investigation or evidence is considered a violation of the vow of truthfulness because it involves speaking falsely.
3. **Revealing someone's secret or private matters (Guhya Bhashan):** Revealing someone's confidential information is considered a violation of the vow of truthfulness because it involves breaking a trust.
4. **Breaking a trust by revealing a secret entrusted to you (Vishwastha Mantra Bhed):** Betraying someone's trust by revealing a secret they shared with you is considered a violation of the vow of truthfulness because it involves breaking a promise.
5. **Creating false documents or records (Kuta Lekh):** Creating false documents, accounts, or writings is considered a violation of the vow of truthfulness because it involves deception.

**The text concludes by stating that these five transgressions are considered violations of the vow of truthfulness.**

##  Transgressions of the Second Vow

**Chapter 3, Light of Yoga, Verse 91**

**Sahsaabhyakhyan** (the second transgression) is to falsely accuse someone or slander them without thinking, like saying "You are a thief," "You are an adulterer," etc. Some consider **Rahasyabhyakhyan** to be the transgression instead. "Rahas" means secret, and a secret is something that happens in seclusion. False praise or slander, gossip, is also Rahasyabhyakhyan. For example, someone might tell an old woman in private that her husband is in love with a young woman, or tell a young woman in private that her husband is skilled in lovemaking and has a strong desire for middle-aged women. Or someone might tell a woman that her husband is like a donkey, very lustful, or that he is impotent. Making fun of someone in this way, or making up false stories about a woman and telling them to her husband, like "Your wife told me in private that she is tired of your excessive indulgence in sensual pleasures," or "She said that she tires out her husband in lovemaking," is Rahasyabhyakhyan. To speak in a way that increases the attraction or attachment between a husband and wife, or to engage in secret conversations or jokes in private that cause the husband to falsely suspect his wife or the wife to falsely suspect her husband, is Rahasyabhyakhyan. Deliberately lying out of malice breaks the vow. It is said that deliberately falsely accusing someone breaks the vow, but if someone slanders or defames someone without purpose, for fun, or without thinking, then the second transgression, Sahsaabhyakhyan, is committed.

**3. Guhyabhashan** (the third transgression) is to reveal confidential matters related to government work (royal affairs) without purpose, unintentionally. Such confidential matters are not meant to be shared with everyone, and ministers are sworn to secrecy. Revealing these secrets through gestures, expressions, or by hinting at them to others, leading to incorrect judgments, is also Guhyabhashan. For example, someone might say, "So-and-so is working against the state." Or, gossiping about each other and causing them to fight, or knowing someone's intentions based on their appearance and behavior and telling someone else in a way that breaks the bond between them, is also Guhyabhashan.

**4. Revealing the secrets of a trusted person** (the fourth transgression) is to reveal a secret that a friend, one's wife, or a trusted person has shared in confidence. Even if the person repeats the secret exactly as it was told to them, it may not seem like a lie from an external perspective, but revealing the secrets of a wife, husband, friend, or trusted person can often lead to shame and even suicide. Because it causes such great harm, it is ultimately a lie. If someone reveals a secret unintentionally or because they believe the person is trustworthy, it is a partial transgression of the vow. Revealing someone's secret, confidential plans, or secret information, even if one has no right to do so, or revealing confidential plans oneself and causing a rift between two lovers, is the fourth transgression.

**5. Kूटलेख** (the fifth transgression) is to write false documents, create fake documents, write using someone else's signature, or forge a signature. Although writing false documents does not involve speaking or being spoken to, it is still a form of falsehood and a partial transgression of the vow of truthfulness, and therefore a transgression. If someone writes a lie in a moment of passion, without speaking, it is a transgression because it violates the boundaries of the vow. Or, if someone believes that they are allowed to lie, but that writing is different and does not affect their vow, and they write a lie with this understanding, then this is the fifth transgression. These are the five transgressions of the second vow.

## Discussion on the Five Transgressions of the Third Anuvrata

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 92**

Now, the five transgressions of the third Anuvrata, Asteya Anuvrata, are as follows:

**Verse 92:**

* **Stenaanujna, Tadaneetadaanam, Dwidrajyalanghanam, Pratiroopkriya, Maanaanaytwam cha Asteyasamshritaha.**

**Meaning:**

1. **Stenaanujna:** Giving permission or advice to a thief to steal.
2. **Tadaneetadaanam:** Helping a thief to steal or assisting him after he has stolen.
3. **Dwidrajyalanghanam:** Leaving one's own kingdom and entering the enemy's kingdom or acting against the state.
4. **Pratiroopkriya:** Showing a good quality item and then giving a bad quality item.
5. **Maanaanaytwam:** Keeping false weights and measures or manipulating them.

These five are the transgressions of the Asteya Anuvrata.

**Explanation:**

The vow of Asteya Anuvrata is taken in the form of "I will not steal, nor will I cause others to steal; through my mind, speech, and body." Therefore, giving inspiration, advice, or permission to a thief to steal, even while thinking "I am not stealing," is the first transgression of the third vow. Or, giving praise, encouragement, or a pat on the back to a thief for stealing. Or, giving a thief tools, weapons, a bag, scissors, etc., for free or for a price. According to the vow of the third vow, this transgression breaks the vow of the practitioner.

Giving someone the inspiration, "Why are you sitting idle? If you don't have food, I will give you some. No one will buy your stolen goods, I will buy them." This kind of inspiration, while thinking "I am not inspiring him to steal, I am inspiring him to earn a living," is considered the first transgression due to the relativity of vow-keeping.

**Tadaneetadaanam** means accepting the goods stolen by a thief. Accepting gold, silver, clothes, etc., stolen by a thief at a low price, for free, or secretly, is also considered stealing because it encourages stealing. The fear of being punished by the government remains, and the person who takes the stolen goods thinks, "I am doing business, where am I stealing?" This kind of outcome, being relative to the vow, does not break the vow of non-stealing, but it is partially kept and partially broken, resulting in a transgression of the form of "Bhangabhang." This is the second transgression.

Going to a forbidden kingdom ruled by an enemy king, violating the established boundaries of the kingdom or the encampment of the army, entering the forbidden enemy kingdom, violating the mutual arrangements of travel between kingdoms, the entry of a resident of one kingdom into another kingdom, and the entry of a resident of another kingdom into another kingdom are all considered **Swami-Adatta**.

The scriptures mention four types of Adatta (theft): Swami-Adatta, Jiva-Adatta, Tirthankara-Adatta, and Guru-Adatta. Here, the fault of Swami-Adatta applies. Even if the state prohibits it, going to another kingdom is punished like a thief. In reality, this is a violation of the state, which is considered theft, and therefore breaks the vow.

Even though the person who goes to another kingdom without permission thinks, "I am not going for theft or espionage, I am going for business," this feeling, due to the relativity of the vow, does not neglect the protection of the vow. However, in social practice, he is considered a thief, punished by the state, and therefore the third transgression applies here.

4. **Tattpratiroopkriya:** Mixing bad quality items with good quality items and selling them at the price of good quality items, adulteration; showing a good quality item and then giving a different inferior quality item. For example, mixing low-quality rice with high-quality rice, mixing fat with ghee, mixing water with milk, mixing sand with medicines, mixing gum or resin with asafoetida, mixing urine with oil, mixing syrup with honey, mixing other metals with pure gold or silver, and selling them, etc., are all examples of **Pratiroopkriya**.

Changing the horns of a stolen cow, etc., by cooking them in fire, bending them down with steam, or making them thin so that the owner cannot recognize them. Or, changing the outer structure of something, changing the sheath of a sword, etc., so that the owner cannot recognize it, and then keeping it or selling it by twisting it around, is the fourth transgression called **Tattpratiroopkriya**.

5. **Maanaanaytwam:** Anything used to measure something is called **Maan**. Keeping weights and measures like ratti, pal, tola, masha, bhar, man, seer (kilogram today), gaj (meter), etc., less than the actual weight or measure, or manipulating the weight or measure while giving the customer the goods. Or, keeping weights and measures more than the actual weight or measure and taking more from others.

Translation preserving Jain terms:

Discourse on the Five Transgressions of the Vow of Brahmacharya (Celibacy)
Take the verse 93 from the third chapter of the Yogashastra. This should be done with the understanding that merely picking a lock or cutting a pocket is not the commonly known theft, but it is the art of trade. From this perspective, making efforts to protect the vow amounts to the aforementioned two transgressions. Or, by providing assistance to a thief to carry out the said five acts; though these are clearly forms of theft, yet they occur due to negligence. Transgressions, violations, or transgressions that occur due to ignorance or lack of understanding are called faults in conduct. It is not the case that these transgressions do not apply to the servants of the king, etc. The first two transgressions generally apply to the servants of the king, etc. Entering the prohibited territory of the enemy is the third transgression, which occurs when a feudal lord, government official, or one under the service of a master (king) assists the adversary (be it the king or anyone else) of his master. Alteration in measurement and counterfeiting are two separate transgressions. Even the king can be subjected to these transgressions if he causes alteration in the measurement of his treasury or counterfeits goods. Thus, these are the five transgressions of the vow of non-stealing (Asteya-Anuvrta).

Now, the five transgressions of the fourth vow (Brahmacharya-Anuvrta) are being explained. 1. Cohabitation with a kept woman (mistress) or a prostitute for a short period, 2. Cohabitation with a woman with whom marriage has not occurred, 3. Marriage with people other than one's own family members or dissatisfaction with one's own wife and marrying another woman without her consent driven by intense desire for sensual pleasures, 4. Intense desire for sexual play, and 5. Engaging in Ananga-krida (erotic play); these are the five transgressions of the vow of Brahmacharya.

Explanation: The more commonly known name of the vow of Brahmacharya is the vow of contentment with one's own wife and abstinence from other women. From this perspective, the five transgressions of this vow are explained - 1. Ittvarat-tagama - The word 'Ittvari' means one kept for a short period. Such a woman could be a prostitute or a mistress who goes to multiple men, or one who is kept on a salary or rent, or one who is kept as a concubine or a servant (Goli) by taking the responsibility of her maintenance. Cohabitation with such a woman is called Ittvarat-tagama. The man who keeps such a woman considers her his wife by his perception or imagination, so there is no violation of the vow of contentment with one's own wife, but due to the fact that she is actually another's woman, even if accepted for a short period, there is a violation of the vow. Thus, Ittvarat-tagama is the first transgression that is both a violation and non-violation. 2. Anatta-gama - 'Anatta' means one who is not taken in marriage, i.e., one who does not have a husband. She could be an unmarried girl, a widow, a prostitute, a promiscuous woman, or an abandoned noblewoman; cohabitation with such an unmarried woman is the second transgression. This transgression occurs due to lack of understanding, ignorance, or negligence, but the abstainer from other's wives does not incur these two transgressions because at that time the prostitute or girl or widow does not have a husband. Prostitutes or promiscuous women do not have a husband at all. And then he accepts her as his wife for a short time. The remaining transgressions apply to both. The five transgressions are worth knowing for the one observing the vow of contentment with one's own wife, but not worth practicing. Other Acharyas' view on this matter is that these two transgressions apply to both the aforementioned types of men; because if the one content with his own wife keeps a woman (prostitute, etc.) for a short time and enjoys her, he incurs the transgression, this is clear. But the abstainer from other's wives also incurs the transgression by cohabiting with a husbandless woman, because the prostitute, etc. is without a husband, and he keeps her as a woman for a short time, after which she goes to another, then she becomes the wife of another, from this perspective, as she is somewhat another's woman, there is a violation of the vow, and as she is actually not another's woman, there is no violation of the vow. In this way, the second transgression, which is both a violation and non-violation, applies to both the one content with his own wife and the abstainer from other's wives. 3. Parvivaaha - Marrying the children of others, apart from one's own son-daughter, etc., or out of the desire to obtain the fruit of giving away a daughter in marriage...

Explanation about the transgressions of the vows of Svadāra-santosa (contentment with one's own spouse) and Paradārātyāga (abstinence from others' spouses)

Yogaśāstra, Tṛtīya Prakāśa, Śloka 93:

1. Paradāravivahakaraṇa (arranging the marriage of others' spouses): If one performs the marriage ceremony out of affection or with the hope that the daughter will also get a match, it is considered a transgression called Paradāravivahakaraṇa.

2. Paradārasaṃsarga (sexual intercourse with others' spouses): One who has taken the vow of Svadārasantosavrata (contentment with one's own spouse) or the vow of not engaging in sexual activity with anyone other than one's own accepted spouse, mentally, verbally, or physically, should abstain from arranging the marriages of others. Facilitating sexual intercourse between others is considered a transgression of this vow.

3. The desire to obtain the fruit of kanyadāna (giving away the daughter in marriage) while in an immature state of right belief (samyagdṛṣṭi) is also a transgression. However, if a person with wrong belief (mithyādṛṣṭi) performs such an act with a benevolent intention, it is considered a case of mithyātva (wrong belief).

4. Kāmakrīḍātīvra-āsakti (excessive attachment to sensual pleasures): When a person neglects all other activities and is obsessed with indulging in sexual pleasures day and night, or remains motionless like a log in the mouth, armpits, or vagina of a woman, or engages in repeated sexual intercourse like male and female birds, and uses aphrodisiacs or tonics to regain sexual potency, it is considered the transgression of Kāmakrīḍātīvra-āsakti.

5. Anangakrīḍā (unnatural sexual acts): The desire of a man to engage in sexual activity with parts of the body other than the genitals, or the desire of a woman or a eunuch to engage in sexual activity with parts of the body other than the genitals, or the desire of a eunuch to engage in sexual activity with a woman, man, or another eunuch, or to perform manual stimulation, is considered Anangakrīḍā.

Atichara of the Fifth Vrata (Vow)

The Yogashastra, in the third prakasha (chapter), sloka 94, states that cutting the nails, hair, etc., and repeatedly kissing, etc., due to the rise of the Mohaniya (deluding) karma, are also called Anangakrida (sensual play). Or, engaging in play with parts of the body other than the sexual organs, such as the thighs, breasts, face, cheeks, armpits, buttocks, etc., is also called Anangakrida.

The Shravaka (lay follower), being extremely afraid of sin, mainly observes the vow of Brahmacharya (celibacy). However, when due to the rise of Vedodaya (the fruition of Vedaniya karma) or Mohaniya karma, he becomes utterly incapable of enduring the sexual urge, then solely for the pacification of the urge, he resorts to the company of his own wife. But he completely renounces the company of all other women. Even in the act of sexual intercourse, he conducts himself like threading a needle, not being overpowered by intense attachment or strong sexual excitement.

It is not desirable to be so excessively restrained that he remains aloof from the intense desire for sexual enjoyment and Anangakrida, and considers all the women of the world, other than his own wife, as his mother, sister, or daughter. The Dharmishtha (pious) Shravaka should refrain from such acts, which are devoid of any benefit, but rather cause a waste of time and energy, diminish spiritual wisdom, impair memory, and sometimes even lead to severe diseases like consumption, etc. The intentional indulgence in these two prohibited faults (atichara) leads to the breach of the vow.

There are some Acharyas (spiritual teachers) who have a different opinion regarding these five atichara. They say that the renunciation of only sexual intercourse with a courtesan or another's wife is required, but not the renunciation of embracing, kissing, etc. Believing this, some who are content with their own wife or have renounced another's wife, engage in embracing, etc., and in that state, these two atichara apply to them to some extent, as they are related to the vow. From this perspective, the content with one's own wife has all five atichara, while the one who has renounced another's wife has only the last three atichara.

On the contrary, some other Acharyas propound a different interpretation regarding these atichara. They say that all five atichara apply to the one who has renounced another's wife. They believe that keeping a courtesan for a certain period and cohabiting with her, since the courtesan is another's wife, leads to the breach of the vow. But in social practice, a courtesan is not considered another's wife, so the breach of the vow does not occur. In this way, for the one who has renounced another's wife, the atichara are of a mixed nature. However, for the one content with his own wife, the breach of the vow does not occur on the grounds that he considers widows, women whose husbands are abroad for a long time, fallen women, or those who do not accept their husbands, as his own, and cohabits with them, but for the one who has renounced another's wife, cohabiting with such women leads to the atichara, because it is commonly understood that she is his wife, but in reality, she is not, so the previous atichara apply. However, the breach of the vow does not occur entirely.

The remaining three atichara - Paravivahakarana (remarriage), Tivrakamabhilasha (intense desire for sexual enjoyment), and Anangakrida (sensual play) - apply to both.

All these atichara are described from the perspective of the male. Regarding the female, there are no such distinctions as Swapatisamtosha (content with one's own husband) and Parapurushatyagi (renouncer of another's husband). For her, all men other than her own husband are considered as Parapurusha (another's husband). Therefore, she has only the Swapurushasamtosha (contentment with one's own husband) vow. If she engages in Paravivahakarana, etc., then the three atichara apply to her. The remaining two atichara may or may not apply to her in relation to her own husband, like a co-wife whose husband has a fixed day to visit her. Considering her husband as a Parapurusha on that day, she engages in cohabitation with him, and in that respect, the atichara applies to her. Until a woman desires or makes efforts for cohabitation with a Parapurusha, the faults of Atikrama, Vyatikrama, or Atichara apply to her, but if she indulges in sexual intercourse with a Parapurusha, then the breach of the vow occurs. For a Brahmachari (one who is not the husband of any woman) or even one's own husband, the desire for intense sexual play would lead to all five atichara. The remaining three atichara should be understood for women in the same way as for men.

##  Transgressions of the Fifth (Parigrahaparimaana) Vow and their Causes

**Chapter 3, Light of Yoga, Verse 94 onwards**

To possess more than the prescribed limit (parimaana) of gold, silver, and other possessions, as defined in the Yoga Shastra, is a transgression of the fifth vow.

**Explanation:**

The transgression occurs when a householder, adhering to the principles of Shravak Dharma, exceeds the quantity or number of possessions they have set for themselves.

**Types of Possessions:**

* **Dhana (Wealth):** There are four types of Dhana:
    * **Ganima:** Items counted, like nutmeg and betel nuts.
    * **Dharim:** Items weighed, like saffron and jaggery.
    * **Mey:** Items measured, like oil, ghee, and cloth.
    * **Parikshya:** Items tested, like gems, jewelry, and pearls.
* **Dhannya (Grain):** There are 17 types of Dhannya:
    * Rice, Barley, Wheat, Chickpeas, Juar, Urad, Masoor, Arhar, Moong, Moth, Chaunla (Rajma), Matar (Kulth), Sesame, Kodo, Raagoon (Raungi), and Sun Dhannya.
    * Some texts mention 24 types of Dhannya.

**Transgressions:**

## Discussion on the transgressions of the fifth vow

**Violation of the fifth vow due to transgression of the numerical limit**

**Verse 94:** Transgression of the numerical limit of the fifth vow occurs due to violation of verse 95 of the third light of Yoga Shastra. ||94||

**Doubt:** Here, a doubt arises: If transgression of the accepted limit (number or quantity) in a vow leads to the breaking of the vow, then how is it called a transgression? We will address this in the following verse. ||266||

**Verse 95:**  From bondage, from feeling, from pregnancy, from journey, and from donation, these five transgressions occur for one who has taken the fifth vow, which are not appropriate for the vow-taker. ||95||

**Explanation:** Even without directly transgressing the limit (number) of possessions like wealth and grain, if one who is observing the vow holds the feeling of vow-protection, and with his understanding (good sense or good intention) believes that he is not breaking the vow, then five transgressions occur for that vow-taker due to the five reasons mentioned above. The vow is broken when he does not have any feeling of vow-protection and does not transgress the limit with the understanding that he is not breaking the vow. In other words, if he knowingly transgresses the limit without caring about vow-protection, then the vow is definitely broken. Here, the transgression of the vow occurs due to the five reasons mentioned above.

For example, a grain merchant has set a limit on the quantity of wealth and grain. Then, a debtor comes to pay his debt, or someone comes to give a gift, and the merchant accepts it, thinking that the quantity increases according to my rule, and my rule is for a certain month; I will accept it after that; for now, I will keep it safe in a corner of the house or with another person, or this thing will be sold from my place, and then I will take it. With this intention, he tells the giver, "Bring it after such and such month, I will take it." Or, he keeps the thing well-packed and tied with a rope in the name of the giver as a trust, and then decides to take it when the time limit of his rule is over. By making such a bond (condition or decision or tie), he keeps more wealth or grain in the house than the fixed quantity and believes that "this is his, not mine; etc." From the perspective of vow-keeping, the vow is not completely broken, but the first transgression occurs.

Similarly, transgression of the number of utensils occurs due to feeling. For example, a householder has made a rule that he will not keep more than a certain number of utensils. Suppose, after making the rule, he receives the same thing as a gift, a reward, or a present, and the number doubles. Now, fearing that his vow will be broken, he breaks and repairs it with the intention of fulfilling the fixed number, combining two into one big thing, or changing its shape or design to reduce its number; but in reality, the increase in its value-proof leads to a partial breaking of the vow. Or, due to the desire to keep the vow, he does not accept the things exceeding the limit at that time, but tells the giver, "I will definitely take them after such and such time, until then you keep them in trust in my name; do not give them to anyone else except me." In this way, he collects them for himself with the desire not to give them to others, and from this perspective, he incurs transgression.

Similarly, the number of cows, buffaloes, mares, etc. is fixed for a certain period. But if the number increases due to the birth of calves, buffaloes, etc. within the fixed time, then he incurs transgression called "Dwipadchatuष्पदातिक्रम". If someone has made a rule not to keep more than a certain number of cows, buffaloes, etc. for one or two years, then he thinks that if the cows, buffaloes, etc. become pregnant during the time of my rule, then the limit of my fixed number will be broken; therefore, he makes the cows, buffaloes, etc. pregnant after a long time. By doing so, the number increases due to the arrival of calves in the womb, and from this perspective, the vow is partially broken; but since the transgression of the number is not visible from the outside, he believes that "the number of these animals has not increased according to my rule; therefore, my rule has not been broken." From this perspective, the third transgression occurs due to the breaking of the vow.

## Translation:

**Excesses in Digvirati and Bhogopabhog**

This seems to be related to the third light of Yoga Shastra, verse 96. Similarly, if the land beyond the specified limit of yojanas (units of distance) for a field or building is acquired, then keeping it secured in one's name for the duration of the rule is an infringement. Alternatively, the meaning of yojana can also be interpreted as "joining". From this perspective, if the number of houses and fields increases due to acquiring them from a debtor, as a gift, or by purchasing a neighbor's house or field, then combining two or more houses or fields together by breaking down the boundary walls, fences, or pillars in between and making them into one house or field, with the understanding that the fixed number has not increased and the vow has not been completely broken, still, the value of the house and field has increased. This is considered the fourth infringement, a form of "Bhangabhang" (partial violation).

Similarly, someone may have taken a vow for four months to not keep more than a certain amount of gold or silver. During this time, the king, pleased with them, gives them gold or silver as a reward. Now, seeing that keeping this gold or silver at home would violate their vow of not keeping more than a certain amount of gold or silver for those months, they decide to keep it at the place of a friend or acquaintance, thinking, "I will take it back when my vow period ends." In reality, even keeping it at another's place constitutes ownership, leading to a violation of the vow. However, since the intention is to keep the vow intact, it is considered a form of "Bhangabhang", the fifth infringement.

Therefore, a Shravak (Jain lay follower) who observes the limits of these five types of parigraha (attachment) should not violate them. Doing so leads to impurity in the vow. These infringements can also occur due to lack of understanding, transgression, etc., apart from the above-mentioned signs.

Thus, the description of the five infringements for each of the five Anuvratas (minor vows) is complete.

Now, the topic of infringements in Gunavratas (major vows) arises. Therefore, the infringements of the first Gunavrata, Digpariman (Digvirati), are explained.

**Verse 96:**

**Meaning:**

1. Forgetting the fixed limit.
2. 3. 4. Violation of the rule of movement in all ten directions, up, down, and sideways.
5. Increase in the area of the field.

These are the five infringements of the first Gunavrata.

**Explanation:**

The ancient teachers have explained the five infringements of Digvirati Vrata as follows:

1. **Smritibhramsha (forgetfulness):** This is the first infringement. It occurs when, while going to or at the time of reaching the fixed limit of movement in a particular direction, one forgets due to excessive anxiety or carelessness. For example, someone may have set a limit of 100 yojanas in the east direction, but they forget or become doubtful whether they have traveled 50 yojanas or 100 yojanas. Even with such doubt, if they go beyond 50 yojanas in that direction, they commit this infringement. Going beyond 100 yojanas would constitute a complete violation of the vow. Infringement and violation of the vow occur based on relativity and absoluteness, respectively. Therefore, one should remember the vow they have taken, as all religious practices are performed with awareness. This is the first infringement.

Flying upwards or climbing a mountain or tree peak is considered upward movement (Urdhvavaman). Going down into a basement, well, etc., is considered downward movement (Adhodisha). Movement in the east and other directions is considered sideways movement (Tiryaggaman). Violation of the fixed limit in these three directions constitutes the three infringements. Therefore, the sutra states that one should understand that violating the upward, downward, and sideways directions constitutes three infringements. These infringements can occur due to non-use (Anabhog) or transgression, etc. However, if one intentionally violates the limit, it constitutes a complete violation of the vow. A Shravak observes this vow in the following way: "I will not violate it myself..."

## Discussion on the 5 transgressions of the second vow, Bhogopabhoga Parimaan

I will discuss the 5 transgressions of the second vow, Bhogopabhoga Parimaan, as described in the third light of Yoga Shastra, verse 97, and I will not ask anyone else to do it. According to this rule, one should not go beyond the designated area, but if one asks or sends someone else to bring something from beyond the designated limit, then it is a transgression.

One who has taken the vow in such a way that they will not transgress the designated limit for themselves, will not be considered to have committed a transgression if they ask or send someone else to bring something from beyond the designated limit. In this way, the second, third, and fourth transgressions occur.

The fifth transgression, called Kshetravriddhi, occurs when a Shravak, having a designated area limit in one direction, reduces it and goes further in another direction with a smaller designated area. For example, if someone reduces the area limit in the east and extends it in the west, then they commit this fifth transgression.

Similarly, if someone has a travel limit of 100 yojanas in each direction, and they travel more than 100 yojanas in one direction, then if they reduce the travel limit in another direction by the same amount to maintain a balance of 100 yojanas on both sides, then this transgression occurs because it violates the area limit in relation to the vow.

If one transgresses the area limit unknowingly and without purpose, then they should return, not go further once they become aware, and not send others forward. If someone has gone unknowingly or by mistake, then they should renounce what they have obtained there and repent by saying "Miccha Mi Dukkadam".

## Now, the transgressions of the second vow, Bhogopabhoga Parimaan, are as follows:

1. **Sachitt** - meaning sentient,
2. **Sachitt Sambaddh** - seeds, kernels, etc. that are present in non-sentient food,
3. **Sammishra Abhishava** - food that is partly sentient and partly non-sentient,
4. **Dushpakva Aahar** - intoxicating substances made from multiple ingredients, and
5. **Dushpakva Aahar** - food that is half-cooked, half-raw, or overcooked.

These five are the transgressions of the second vow, Bhogopabhoga Parimaan, in order.

## Explanation:

Sachitt means "with consciousness". This means that any food that is alive is called Sachitt. Such food, which is itself a one-sense organism of the plant kingdom, is called Sachitt Aahar.

Here the question arises: How can a householder renounce Sachitt food when they have to cook wheat, etc., which are Sachitt substances? In response, it is said that the word "Aahar" (food) is attached to all five of these, Sachitt, etc. It is not attached in the original verse, but it is understood by implication. Therefore, in this vow, the Shravak does not renounce Sachitt, nor can they, because Sachitt includes all types of grains, such as soil, water, fire, fruits, flowers, vegetables, leaves, mung beans, chickpeas, etc. Therefore, they renounce Sachitt Aahar. When they eat, they do not eat it in its Sachitt form, but they eat it after making it non-sentient.

If someone who has renounced Sachitt Aahar eats something in its Sachitt form, then they commit the first transgression, which is a partial violation of the vow, provided that they have eaten it unknowingly, without purpose, in haste, or with the desire to eat or the intention to eat.

Sachittpratibandh Aahar means that the substance is non-sentient, but it contains a sentient substance. For example, ripe fruits like mangoes or dates, and nuts like dates and prunes, are non-sentient, but they contain kernels and seeds, which have the power to germinate, and therefore they are sentient. Therefore, when a renunciant of Sachitt eats ripe fruits, etc., they remove the kernels or seeds or process them with fire or spices to make them non-sentient before eating them. If a renunciant of Sachitt accidentally or without purpose, unknowingly or hastily, or with the thought "I will eat these after removing the seeds, etc.", eats dates, mangoes, etc., then they commit the second transgression, called Sachittpratibandh.

Sammishra Aahar means that a sentient substance is mixed with a non-sentient substance. For example, if a wheat roti is made, and it contains whole wheat grains, which are sentient. Or if non-sentient rice or barley is mixed with sentient sesame seeds, and it is eaten hastily, then the transgression called Sammishra Aahar is committed. Or if boiled water

The nature of Angarajivica, Vanajivica and Shaktajivica

The third light of Yoga Shastra, verses 98 to 101, states that if raw water is mixed and consumed hastily, it is considered an excess. Or if a sentient food item is not completely non-sentient, consuming it is considered an excess. However, this excess only applies when a Shravak unknowingly, hastily, or without purpose, consumes the sentient as non-sentient. This excess is considered due to its relation to the vow. The fourth excess is Abhishavaahar. Abhishava means a intoxicating substance made by combining many substances. For example, things like wine, sauvir, toddy, liquor, and alcohol all fall under Abhishava. Similarly, substances that increase the potency of semen, such as bhang, tobacco, zarda, chards, ganja, sulfa, etc., are also included in Abhishava. Meat, blood, fat, etc., things that are the result of killing a living being, are also Abhishava. If one intentionally consumes this type of Abhishava-like food, then the vow is broken. And if one unknowingly or hastily consumes the above-mentioned substances without purpose, then the fourth excess called Abhishava-ahar is incurred. The fifth excess is Duspakvaahar. This means consuming food that is not fully cooked. Or consuming food that is overcooked. There are many things that, if eaten in an uncooked or overcooked state, can harm the body. Sometimes, eating them can cause many diseases in the body. To the extent that it is sentient, to that extent, eating it also spoils the afterlife. For example, eating barley, rice, wheat, etc., without cooking or half-cooked, spoils health. If one eats half-cooked or overcooked food unknowingly, then the fifth excess called Duspakvaahar is incurred. Many Acharyas consider Apakvaahar to be an excess; however, the meaning of Apakva is not cooked in fire, so it is included in Sachittaahar. Many Acharyas consider Tuccaushadhibhakshan to be an excess. Tuccaaushadhis (plants) are those in which the edible part is very small and the part to be thrown away is more. For example, plants like Sajna, Sitafal, etc. But if they are sentient, then they are included in the first excess. And if they have become non-sentient by being cooked in fire, etc., then what is the fault in consuming them? That is, there is no fault in it. Similarly, if someone has given up night meals or drinking alcohol, eating meat, etc., and unknowingly, hastily, or by mistake eats them, then an excess is incurred. In this way, these five excesses of the Upbhog-Paribhogpariman vow should be understood.

After describing the excesses that occur due to food in the seventh vow, now we describe the excesses that occur due to karma in its second division.

The five excesses mentioned above are to be abandoned in relation to food. But in relation to karma, there are 15 karmaadans, which are considered to be harsh karma that causes harm to living beings, and which create impurities in the vow. Therefore, they should be abandoned properly.

The five excesses mentioned above are related to food, which are to be abandoned. Now we explain the second explanation of Bhogopabhogpariman, that the business or profession that is done to procure or produce the means of Bhogopabhog is also referred to by the word 'Bhogopabhog'. Here, the action is attributed to the cause; therefore, the livelihood that is carried out due to the said karma, such as the Kotwal, secret agent, soldier, jailer, etc., who give harsh punishments. This causes pain to the person, such harsh (difficult) livelihoods are 15; which are called fifteen karmaadans. These are the 15 excesses to be abandoned in the second division of Bhogopabhogpariman. These karmas are the cause of the nature of papkarma, therefore they are called karmaadans.

Their names are mentioned in the next two verses.

Angar-Van-Shakat-Bhatak-Sphotjivica, Danta-Laksha-Ras-Kesh-Vishvaanijyakani cha.

Yantrapeeda-Nirlanchanamasatiposhanam tatha, Davadanam Sarasshosha, iti panchadasha tyajet.

These 15 excesses are to be abandoned.

## The Nature of the Commerce of Teeth, Lac, Juice, and Hair

**From the Third Light of Yoga Shastra, Verses 101-105:**

1. **Angarajivica** (Commerce of Fire)
2. **Vanajivica** (Commerce of the Forest)
3. **Shakatjivica** (Commerce of the Cart)
4. **Bhatakjivica** (Commerce of Hire)
5. **Sphotkajivica** (Commerce of Explosion)
6. **Dantvaanijya** (Commerce of Teeth)
7. **Laakshavaanijya** (Commerce of Lac)
8. **Rasavaanijya** (Commerce of Juice)
9. **Keshavaanijya** (Commerce of Hair)
10. **Vishavaanijya** (Commerce of Poison)
11. **Yantrapidaakarma** (Commerce of Torture by Machines)
12. **Nilaanchanakarma** (Commerce of Branding)
13. **Asatiposhan** (Commerce of Nourishing the Unworthy)
14. **Davadaan** (Commerce of Setting Fire)
15. **Sarahsosha** (Commerce of Drying up Water Bodies)

(The word "Jivica" is used in the first half of the verse, and "Vaanijya" in the second half, which should be combined with each.)

A Shravak (Jain follower) should renounce these 15 forms of Karmadaan (acts of violence).

**Explanation of the 15 Forms of Violence:**

**1. Angarajivica (Commerce of Fire):**

* Making charcoal by burning wood and trading it.
* The work of bakers, potters, blacksmiths, goldsmiths, brick makers, etc.

**Explanation:**

Making charcoal involves the potential for harming many stationary and mobile beings. Therefore, all forms of violence related to fire are included in Angarajivica. This is a detailed explanation of one type of Karmadaan; the other types should be understood in the same way.

**2. Vanajivica (Commerce of the Forest):**

* Selling leaves, flowers, and fruits from trees, whether cut or uncut.
* Earning a living by grinding or crushing grains in a mill.

**Explanation:**

Vanajivica primarily involves the potential for harming plant life.

**3. Shakatjivica (Commerce of the Cart):**

* Making carts and their parts, such as wheels and axles, either by oneself or by others.
* Selling or buying carts.

**Explanation:**

Shakatjivica is harmful because it leads to the oppression of all beings and causes the killing and binding of animals like oxen, horses, and cows.

**4. Bhatakjivica (Commerce of Hire):**

* Earning a living by transporting goods on carts, oxen, camels, buffaloes, donkeys, mules, or horses for a fee.
* Hiring out these animals or vehicles.

**Explanation:**

Hiring out motor vehicles is also considered Bhatakjivica.

**5. Sphotkajivica (Commerce of Explosion):**

* Earning a living by digging wells, quarrying stones, or engaging in other activities that involve disturbing the earth.

**Explanation:**

These activities can harm beings that live in the earth.

Vishavaniijya and Yantra Pidana Karma

Yogashastra, Trutiya Prakasha, Shloka 106-108:

1. Earning a livelihood by engaging in destructive activities towards the earth element, such as digging ponds, wells, etc., breaking stones, etc., is called Sphotajivika (explosive livelihood). (105)

2. Procuring and selling the body parts (teeth, hair, nails, bones, skin, etc.) of living beings from their natural habitats for the purpose of trade is called Dantavaniijya (trade in body parts). (106) 

3. The trade of harmful substances like lac, indigo, dhatakyadi (a tree used for making liquor), and tankana (borax) is called Lakshavaniijya (trade in harmful substances), as it leads to the destruction of life. (107)

4. The trade of commodities like ghee, fat, honey, and alcoholic drinks, as well as the trade of bipeds (humans) and quadrupeds (animals), is called Rasavaniijya (trade in edibles) and Keshavaniijya (trade in living beings) respectively. All these trades involve harm to life and are therefore to be avoided. (108)

## Explanation of the Transgressions of the Samayik Vrat

**From Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verses 114-115**

It is believed that there can be more than five transgressions of the Samayik Vrat. This is because many mistakes can be made due to ignorance. Therefore, one should understand the appropriate transgressions for each Vrat.

**Doubt:** Are actions like Angarakarma, etc., considered Kharakarma? How are these considered transgressions? Because all these actions are in the form of Kharakarma and Karmadan.

**Answer:** In reality, all these are in the form of Kharakarma. Therefore, those who adopt the Vrat of renouncing these actions consider them transgressions. Those who perform such actions intentionally, their Vrat is broken. ||113||

Now, we discuss the transgressions of the Anarthadanda-Virati Vrat. ||285||

**Verse 114:**

**Meaning:**

1. Keeping the means or the object of violence together.
2. Keeping more than necessary means of enjoyment.
3. Speaking without thinking.
4. Acting like a clown.
5. Using words that arouse lust.

These five are the transgressions of Anarthadanda-Virati. ||114||

**Explanation:**

These five transgressions are mentioned for those who have renounced Anarthadanda. They are as follows:

* **First Transgression:** The object that makes the soul eligible for bad destiny is called "Adhikarana". Keeping together or near objects like a mortar, pestle, plow, cart, dice with a bow, arrow, etc., is the first transgression. A Shravak should not keep such objects together, but should keep them separate. If the objects are kept together and someone asks for them, it cannot be refused. But if they are scattered, it can be easily refused. This is the first transgression, which is the form of violent giving of Anarthadanda.

* **Second Transgression:** Excessive use of the objects or means of the five senses leads to excessive enjoyment. Excessive enjoyment, by its nature, is excessive enjoyment. This transgression occurs due to careless conduct. Storing or using excessively items like bath, drink, food, sandalwood, saffron, musk, clothes, ornaments, etc., for oneself or one's family is the second transgression called "Pramada". In this regard, the ancient tradition in "Aavashyakachurni" states that those who consume excessive oil, amla, soap, etc., and bathe by jumping or entering ponds and other water bodies, and waste excessive water, cause great harm to aquatic creatures and other beings. It is not appropriate or desirable for a Shravak to do so. What is the proper conduct for a Shravak? A Shravak should primarily bathe at home. If that is not possible, they should apply oil and massage their head, apply amla powder on their head, and then go to a water body. Upon reaching a pond or other water body, they should sit on the bank and take water in a vessel and bathe by pouring water over themselves. However, they should not enter the water body. They should avoid flowers that may contain insects like "Kunthua" and other "Trasajivas". Similarly, one should understand the same for other means. This is the second transgression.

* **Third Transgression:** Speaking foolishly without thinking, speaking rudely and impolitely, and talking nonsense without being asked is the third transgression called "Papopadeśa".

* **Fourth Transgression:** "Kautkuchya" means acting like a clown. "Kut" means "Kutshit" (bad) and "Kuch" means "Cheshta" (action). Acting like a clown with one's eyes, lips, nose, hands, feet, and mouth, and contracting one's limbs is called "Kautkuchya". The meaning is that speaking words or acting in a way that makes others laugh and reveals one's inferiority is the fourth transgression called "Kautkuchya".

* **Fifth Transgression:** "Kandarpa" means speaking in a way that arouses lust or desire, or speaking about things that arouse lust. This is the fifth transgression called "Kandarpa". In this regard, the Shravak's conduct is that they should not say or do anything that creates attachment or lust in themselves or others. Otherwise, they will incur the fifth transgression called "Kandarpa". These two transgressions occur due to careless conduct.

Thus, the transgressions of the three Gunavrats are complete. Now, it is time to discuss the transgressions of the Shikshavrats. The first transgression of the Samayik Vrat is mentioned. ||286||

**Verse 115:**

**Meaning:**

* Evil intentions of body, speech, and mind.
* Disrespect.
* Not remembering the Samayik Vrat.

These are the transgressions of the Samayik Vrat. ||115||

## Explanation of the Transgressions of Samayik Vrat

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 115:**

**Meaning:**  Evil intentions, disrespect, and forgetfulness of the body, speech, and mind are the five transgressions of Samayik Vrat. ||115||

**Explanation:**

* **Kayadushpranidhan (Transgression of the Body):**  Engaging in sinful activities with the body.  Not keeping the limbs of the body, such as hands and feet, still, and moving them repeatedly up and down.
* **Vagdushpranidhan (Transgression of Speech):** Speaking words that are meaningless, doubtful, or ambiguous, or words that incite sin.
* **Manodushpranidhan (Transgression of Mind):**  Having thoughts of anger, greed, hatred, jealousy, pride, etc., distracting the mind from virtuous activities, and creating confusion in the mind due to attachment to worldly affairs.

These three types of transgressions occur through the combined actions of the mind, speech, and body.

It is said, "Even though sitting, standing, etc., on the ground without seeing or cleaning it does not constitute violence, but due to carelessness and negligence, the Samayik Vrat is not considered pure." (Shravak Pragyapti 313-15)

One who performs Samayik should first reflect with their intellect and then speak blameless words. Otherwise, the Samayik Vrat will be corrupted.

Those Shravak-Shravika who perform Samayik while worrying about their household affairs, their minds are immersed in worldly thoughts, and their Samayik Vrat is futile and meaningless.

**Disrespect:**  Performing Samayik without enthusiasm or reverence.

One who does not perform Samayik at the regular time, even when it is convenient, and only does it when forced or when time permits, or who completes the Samayik time with great negligence, is considered to have committed the transgression of disrespect.

It is said, "Completing Samayik immediately after reciting it, or not doing it at the regular time, performing it at will whenever one desires, such instability, disorganization, and disrespect do not make the Samayik pure." (Shravak Pragyapti 317) This is the fourth transgression.

**Forgetfulness:**  Forgetting the time to perform Samayik, or forgetting whether one has performed it or not, or whether it is still to be done.  Forgetting such a noble religious practice due to strong negligence, etc., is considered the transgression of forgetfulness.

It is said, "One who forgets when to perform Samayik, or whether they have performed it or not, even if they have performed it, their Samayik should be considered futile." (Shravak Pragyapti 316) This is the fifth transgression.

**Doubt:**

There is a doubt that "Samayik is rendered meaningless by Kayadushpranidhan, etc." It was previously said that this is actually the absence of Samayik, and transgression is merely a form of Vrat-malinta (impurity of the vow). If there is no Samayik, how can there be a transgression of it? Therefore, it should be said that this is not a transgression of Samayik, but rather a breaking of Samayik!

**Resolution:**

Breaking occurs intentionally, but transgression occurs due to ignorance or non-use.

**Further Question:**

Samayik is the renunciation of sinful actions in two and three ways. In this, Kayadushpranidhan, etc., break the aforementioned rule. This leads to the absence of Samayik, and one should perform atonement for the sin caused by its breaking. It is impossible to stabilize a restless mind in Manodushpranidhan, so it is better not to perform Samayik than to perform it. It is said, "It is better not to do it than to do it improperly."

**Answer:**

Your statement is not true, because Samayik is taken from the "two and three ways." It is performed in six categories (types) by not doing and not causing sinful actions with the mind, speech, and body. Even if one of these renunciations is broken, the rest remain intact. This means that Samayik is not completely broken, and the transgression can be purified by giving "Miccha Mi Dukkadam."

When the mind's results are corrupted, the practitioner's intention is not the same, and giving "Miccha Mi Dukkadam" purifies it. In this way, there is no complete absence of Samayik.

**Sarva-Virati Samayik**

## Five Transgressions of the Desavakashika Vrat

**Chapter 3, Light of Yoga, Verse 116**

It should be understood in the same way as mentioned in the third light of Yoga Shastra, verse 116; because even after the breaking of the vow of secrecy, the ascetics are only said to have committed 'Mithya Dushkrut' and the second type of atonement is prescribed. The practice of Samayik with transgressions, over time, becomes pure. Other religious teachers have also said - "Skill comes from practice, and the individual progresses." Just as a single drop of water does not create a hole in a stone, it takes repeated action. Therefore, it is better not to expect perfection from the beginning; it is not wise to say so. Such a statement is indicative of neglect and a sign of disinterest in religious practices. Scholars say that it is better not to expect perfection from the beginning; this statement is said out of jealousy; because the one who does not perform the ritual incurs a greater atonement, while the one who performs it incorrectly incurs a lesser atonement. Because not performing a religious act is a violation of the Lord's command, a great sin, and the one who performs the act is only guilty of transgression. ||115||

Many people say that a Shravak should perform Samayik alone in the Poushadshala, not with many others. This statement should not be understood as absolute truth based on the scriptural verse 'Ege Abie'. Because the opposite statement is also found in the Vyavahar Bhashya. There it is said - "Rajsuyai Panchavi Poshasalae Sammilia", meaning that the five Poushadshalas, including the Rajpatra, are gathered together. What more can be said? These five transgressions are said to be of the Samayik Vrat. Now, we will explain the five transgressions of the Desavakashika Vrat. ||287||

**Preshya Prayoga, Aayan, Pudgal Kshepan, Shabdanupat, and Rupanupat are the five transgressions of the Desavakashika Vrat.** ||116||

**Explanation:**

The Desavakashika Vrat is a special form of Digparimanavat. It has the distinction that the Digvrat is for life, a year, or a season, while the Desavakashika Vrat is for a day, a watch, a Muhurta, etc. It has five transgressions. They are as follows:

1. **Preshya Prayoga:** When there is a need to work outside the area that has been self-imposed, sending someone else instead of going oneself. If one goes oneself, it is a violation of the vow, therefore this is called Preshya Prayoga. The Desavakashika Vrat is taken with the intention of avoiding the killing of living beings that occurs due to the business of going and coming. But whether the Desavakashika Vrati does it himself or has someone else do it, there is no significant difference. Rather, if one goes with the intention of minimizing harm, one can also avoid the sin of killing. If someone else is sent, they may not be mindful of the rules and may incur sins like Ajanna. This is the first transgression.

2. **Aayan:** Consciously bringing material from outside the area that has been self-imposed for travel, if one goes oneself, it is a violation of the vow, and if one has someone else bring it, it is not a violation of the vow, but it is a transgression. This is the second transgression.

3. **Pudgal Kshepan:** Throwing pebbles, wood, matches, etc., in such a way that the other person understands the gross signal and comes closer, but does not do the work himself. This is the third transgression.

4. **Shabdanupat:** If one has made a rule not to go outside the house where one is staying, but then work comes from outside, one thinks, "If I go myself, my rule will be broken." So, one cannot go outside oneself. To call someone outside by sneezing or coughing, making an inaudible sound, so that the other person comes closer, this is the fourth transgression called Shabdanupat.

5. **Rupanupat:** For the same reason, showing one's form to the person outside, so that they come closer, this is the fifth transgression called Rupanupat. This means that if one is unable to call a person outside the boundaries of the vow due to fear of breaking the vow, then the practitioner should make a sound that the person can hear, or show their form to call them. This is the fourth and fifth transgression called Shabdanupat and Rupanupat, respectively, due to the relativity of the vow.

The first two transgressions, Preshan and Aayan, are committed due to lack of pure understanding, or due to past habits, while the remaining three transgressions are committed due to deception. This is the secret.

## Five Transgressions of the Atithi-Samvibhaga Vrata

**From Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verses 117-118**

It should be understood that just as the five Anuvratas are summarized in Digvrata, similarly, the five Anuvratas and Gunavratas etc. are summarized in Deshavakashika Vrata. A question arises: In Digvrata, only transgressions related to direction are mentioned, not transgressions related to the summarization of other Vratas. Then how have the elders considered Deshavakashika Vrata as the summarized form of all Vratas? 

The solution is that this Vrata is the summarized form of other Vratas like Pranatipat etc. In this Vrata, transgressions like killing, binding etc. should be known. The implication is that the purpose of summarizing Digvrata is to summarize the boundaries of the area. Separate transgressions like sending, bringing etc. are possible. Therefore, the summarized form of Digvrata is called Deshavakashika Vrata.

**Now, the transgressions of the Poushadha Vrata are mentioned:**

**Verse 117:**

**Meaning:**

In the Poushadha Vrata, to eat without seeing or cleaning the place, to take or keep things without cleaning them, to spread a seat without cleaning it, to disrespect the Poushadha or not remember it; these are the five transgressions of the Poushadha Vrata.

**Explanation:**

In Poushadha, the place where there is a small or large amount of saliva, phlegm etc. should be carefully looked at and cleaned with the corner of a cloth or a broom. Then, it should be cleaned properly. This means that the mentioned impure substances of the body should be discarded with discernment. Not doing so constitutes the first transgression of the Poushadha Vrata.

"Aadan" means to take. To take or keep useful things like wood, a plank, a bed etc. without seeing or cleaning them constitutes the second transgression. Similarly, when spreading a seat made of Darbha, Kusha, blanket, cloth etc., to spread it without seeing or cleaning it constitutes the third transgression called "Apratyupekshan" and "Aparamarjan". This transgression occurs due to carelessness, haste, uselessness, seeing and cleaning without proper attention, and cleaning carelessly. The "Nan" prefix in the words "Paramarjan" and "Avekshan" indicates negation. It has the meaning of censure, just as a censured Brahmin is called a non-Brahmin. This should be understood here. The original scripture, Shri Upasakadasangasutra, states the same thing: "Apratilit-Dushtpratilikhit-Shayya-Santhara, Aparamarjit-Dushtparamarjit-Shayya-Santhara; Apratilit-Dushtpratilikhit-Sthandila (excrement-cleaning)-Bhoomi, Aparamarjit-Dushtparamarjit-Sthandila (place for excrement)-Bhoomi; this is the third transgression.

To have disrespect for the Poushadha Vrata and its actions or rituals, i.e., to perform the Poushadha with a lack of enthusiasm, to complete the Poushadha ritual in any way, constitutes the fourth transgression called "Anadar". Similarly, to forget the Poushadha after accepting it, not remembering whether a particular ritual was performed or not, constitutes the fifth transgression called "Asmriti". These transgressions apply to those who have taken the complete Poushadha. Those who have taken the Poushadha partially (from a particular place) do not incur these transgressions.

**Now, the transgressions of the Atithi-Samvibhaga Vrata are mentioned:**

**Verse 118:**

**Meaning:**

To place an object on something that is alive, to cover it with something alive, to delay the time of giving a gift, to be envious, to call one's own thing as someone else's; these are the five transgressions of the fourth Shiksha Vrata.

**Explanation:**

To place an object like earth, a water pot, burning embers from a stove, or grains etc. on something that is alive with the intention of not giving it to a worthy person. A person with a low mind thinks that a worthy person will not take anything that is placed on something alive. Knowing this, a foolish Shravak places the object to be given on something alive, or keeps it there. He thinks that the worthy person will not be able to take it, and thus I will benefit. This is the first transgression.

Similarly, as mentioned above, to cover the object to be given with something alive like a root, a leaf, a flower, a fruit etc. with the intention of not giving it to worthy people.

In the Jain temple, spending wealth is considered a good deed. 
This is the second transgression. 
And if a sadhu (Jain monk) eats food before or after the appropriate time for begging, that is the third transgression. 
And if one feels envy or anger towards a sadhu, or gets angry when a sadhu asks for something, or if one does not give anything even when the sadhu asks for food, that is the fourth transgression. 
If someone in a normal situation gives something to a sadhu as alms, and then out of envy, gives something to the sadhu saying, "He gave this, so I am not less than him. Take this," then this is giving out of envy towards another. 
Here, giving out of envy for another's progress or wealth is a transgression because it is not a spontaneous act of faith. 
In Anekārthasangraha (3/621), I have said that to feel anger towards another's wealth or prosperity is envy. 
This is the fourth transgression. 
If one does not want to give food to a sadhu, then one should not make excuses like, "Guruvar! This jaggery, etc., is another person's." 
This is called the transgression of Anyaapadesha. 
The meaning of Vyapadesha is to make an excuse. 
In Anekārthasangraha (4/323), three meanings of the word Apadesha are given: reason, excuse, and goal. 
Here, the word Upadesha is taken in the sense of an excuse. 
This is the fifth transgression. 
These five transgressions are mentioned in the Atithisanvibhaga Vrat. 
The feeling of transgression should be understood in this way. 
If the aforementioned faults are committed due to forgetfulness, etc., then it is considered a transgression. 
Otherwise, it is considered a violation of the vow. 
In this way, the twelve vows based on Samyaktva were discussed, and then their transgressions were also described. 
Now, describing the special characteristics of the aforementioned vow, the description of the Mahashravak (great devotee) is presented. 
"Thus, being steadfast in the vows, with devotion, sowing wealth in the seven fields, and with compassion for the extremely poor, one is called a Mahashravak." 
Meaning: 
Explanation: - Thus, as mentioned earlier, a Shravak (lay devotee) who is steadfast in the twelve vows based on Samyaktva, without any transgressions, should spend the wealth earned justly in the seven fields: Jin-pratima (statue of the Tirthankara), Jin-agama (Jain scriptures), sadhu (Jain monk), sadhvi (Jain nun), Shravak (lay devotee), and Shravika (lay female devotee). 
The verse states that a Shravak should sow the seed of wealth in these seven fields. 
The use of the word "vapan" (sowing) indicates that it is appropriate to sow in a good field. 
One should not sow in an unsuitable field. 
Therefore, it is said "Saptaskhetryam" (in the seven fields), meaning that one should spend one's wealth appropriately and with devotion in the seven fields, which are the most worthy recipients. 
—
In
1. Jinpratima - A statue of the Tirthankara made of precious substances like diamond, sapphire, lapis lazuli, moonstone, sunstone, ruby, coral, gold, silver, sandalwood, fine stone, and fine clay, which is adorned with special characteristics and brings joy upon seeing it. 
Therefore, it is said, "He who, according to his means, makes a beautiful statue of Sri Jinendradev from fine clay, pure stone, silver, wood, gold, gems, jewels, sandalwood, etc., attains great happiness in both humanity and divinity." (Samodha Pra. 1/322) 
And seeing the statue of Sri Jinendradev, which is pleasing, adorned with all auspicious characteristics, and decorated with all ornaments, brings immense joy to the mind, which is even greater than Nirjara (a state of detachment). 
In this way, one should establish the statue made according to the scriptural method, perform the eight-fold worship, celebrate the Sanghyatra (pilgrimage), adorn it with special ornaments, and offer various clothes. 
In this way, one should sow the seed of wealth in the Jinpratima, i.e., spend wealth. 
Therefore, it is said, "A householder Shravak who offers fragrant powder, flowers, Akshata (unhusked rice), incense, lamps filled with fresh ghee, various types of offerings, self-ripened fruits, and water-filled vessels, etc., to Sri Jinendradev, and performs the eight-fold worship, attains the great happiness of liberation in a short time." 
Here, one may ask, "The Jin-pratima is devoid of attachment and aversion. What benefit does Jin Bhagwan get from its worship? No matter how well one worships it, they neither become happy nor satisfied. One cannot get any benefit from an unsatisfied or dissatisfied deity." 
To this, one can logically answer that this is not true. 
Unsatisfied

In a Jain temple, spending wealth yields results even greater than those obtained from the third light of Yoga Shastra, verse 119, or from an unfulfilled wish-fulfilling gem (Chintamani) and other such things. In the Shri Vitrag-Stotra 19/3, it is said: "How can one obtain results from something that is not pleased?" This is illogical. Do inert wish-fulfilling gems and other such things not yield results? They do. Similarly, the Jain idol also yields results. Even if there is no benefit from the worshiped ones, they are still beneficial to the worshiper. Just as remembering a mantra yields results of its form, and consuming fire yields results like heat, similarly, serving and worshipping the Jain idol should be understood as a cause of benefit. (Shra. Pu. 348) Here, we have described the method of creating a self-made idol. Similarly, one should worship idols created by others. And if no one has created an idol, one should still worship and pay homage to such an eternal idol according to the proper method and as appropriate. Jain idols are of three types: 1. Jain idols created by oneself out of devotion, established in a temple by oneself for the devotion of others. For example, many devotees create them nowadays. 2. Auspicious idols or images are established on auspicious mounds (Chaitya) or at the entrance of houses for auspiciousness. 3. There are eternal mounds (Chaitya) that no one creates, but eternal idols exist in the upper realms, lower realms, and the realm of transmigration (tiryagloka) in an eternal form. There is no place in the three realms that is not purified by the Jain idol. It is appropriate to worship Jain idols only after attributing the quality of non-attachment (Vitragabhav) to them.

2. Jain Temple - The second area where one should invest their wealth (seed) is the Jain abode. One should build a Jain temple by acquiring stones, wood, etc., naturally obtained from land free from inauspicious substances like bones, coal, etc., and paying generous wages to carpenters, masons, blacksmiths, artisans, etc., while carefully protecting the beings of the six categories of life (Shatjivanikaya). However, one should never force, cheat, or get this work done for free from the aforementioned individuals. If one has good wealth, one should build a temple like that of King Bharat, adorned with gem-studded stones, a golden base, pillars and steps made of gems, adorned with hundreds of gem-studded arches, a large pavilion with statues, etc., all adorned with excellent craftsmanship. The smoke from the burning fragrant incense like camphor, musk, and agarwood should touch the sky, and the sweet sounds of peacocks dancing joyfully due to the fear of clouds caused by the smoke should be heard. The sky should resonate with the sounds of auspicious musical instruments all around. The temple should be adorned with canopies made of various fabrics like celestial garments, etc., and adorned with pearls. It should be adorned with clusters of pearls hanging down. The group of gods should be descending from above and returning after seeing the temple. They should be singing, dancing, jumping, roaring like lions. The crowd should be overjoyed by the approval of the gods, seeing this effect. The temple should have various scenes and strange paintings that make many people feel like they are drawn by a painter. It should be adorned with whisks, umbrellas, flags, etc., and a large flag should be flying on its peak. The directions should be filled with the sounds of small flags with many bells fluttering. The group of gods, demons, and celestial nymphs should be singing music competitively, attracted by such wonders. The sweet songs of the singers should have defeated the sound of the celestial musicians' (Gandharva) musical instruments, and the celestial dancers should be constantly gathering there, dancing in rhythm and time, performing, and making gestures. The wealthy people should be amazed by seeing them. Millions of connoisseurs should gather there, attracted by the desire to see the plays with acting. Such a Jain temple should be built on the peak of a high mountain or in a land of blessings where the Jineshwara were born, initiated, attained omniscience, and attained liberation. Or, like King Samprati, one should build such a temple in every village, town, and neighborhood in a good location. This is the duty of a great Shravak.

But if one does not have such wealth, one should still build a Jain temple, even if it is like a hut made of grass. It is said: "Whoever builds a Jain temple even like a hut made of grass for the Jineshwara, and devoutly offers even a single flower, obtains such merit that cannot be measured. Then, the man who builds a large temple made of strong stone slabs is truly a man of good intentions.

---------------------------
The proper use of a Shravak's wealth is described in the Jinagam.

Chapter 3 of the Yoga Shastra, verse 119, states that it is a great fortune for a king or any other wealthy person to build a Jin Mandir. Along with the construction, they should also donate a lot of wealth, land, villages, cities, or cowsheds for its upkeep and devotion.

In this way, one should invest their wealth in the Jin Mandir, and if any temple is dilapidated, they should also renovate it. If it is destroyed or corrupted, they should also restore it.

Here, there is a doubt: Is it not appropriate for a clever Shravak, a devotee of the pure, sinless Jin Dharma, to build a Jin Mandir, a Jin statue, or perform Jin Puja, because doing so would violate the six living beings? Digging the ground, breaking stones, making bricks, filling the ground, collecting bricks, and wetting them with water all involve the violation of Earth beings, Water beings, Air beings, Plant beings, and Animal beings. Therefore, a Jin Mandir cannot be built without harming living beings!

The answer is: A Shravak who is attached to the initial acquisition of wealth for themselves or their family, should use their wealth for the construction of a Jin Mandir, etc., so that their wealth acquisition is not futile. This is for their own welfare.

In support of this, it is said that it is not right to earn wealth for the sake of religion. From this perspective, it is better not to desire wealth for religion than to desire it. Because it is better to avoid touching mud in the first place than to get your feet dirty in the mud and then wash them.

Secondly, building a Jin Mandir, etc., is not a cause of inauspicious karma-bondage, like digging wells, ponds, etc., but rather a cause of auspicious karma-bondage. There will be frequent visits of the fourfold Shri Sangh, religious discourses, observance of vows, and other religious activities. This is a form of auspicious karma, either in the form of wealth or in the form of liberation.

Even though there is violation of the six living beings in this place, the compassionate Shravak's efforts result in the protection of subtle beings, so they do not incur the sin-bondage related to violation. It is said that even if a diligent Shravak, who has pure determination and follows the Dharma path according to the scriptures, harms living beings, their actions will still bear the fruit of liberation.

The statement of the perfect sages, who have attained the essence of the entire Ganipatika, i.e., the twelve-fold scriptures, is that "the results are as the soul is, not according to the external action." This means that behind the construction of a Jin Mandir, etc., there is no result of violence from the perspective of determination, but rather the result of devotion.

A great Shravak who accepts the Shravak-Pratima and does not even acquire wealth for their family, if they build a Jin Mandir, etc., they do not incur the sin of karma due to the violation of the six living beings.

And what is said, that just as the six living beings are killed due to the causes of the body, etc., so also they are killed in the construction of a Jin Mandir or Jin Puja, (Pancha. 4/45) is a sign of ignorance. What is the benefit of further elaboration?

3. Jin-Agam - The third field is Jin-Agam. In this field also, the Shravak should invest their wealth. Because, like a mantra to destroy the poison of wrong impressions born from false scriptures, it is like a lamp in the dense darkness of ignorance, like an island for those drowning in the ocean of the world, like a Kalpavriksha in the desert, the Jinagam is very rare to obtain in this world.

The Agam is the one that gives knowledge of the form of Shri Jinendra Dev, his principles, and his teachings. In praise, it is said: "We understand that you, who have attained the supreme state of being a liberated soul, have the power of your own right conduct. Your rule, which destroys the vices of evil desires, is worthy of my salutations."

A person who has deep respect for the Jinagam is honored by gods, gurus, and religion. Not only that, but sometimes they attain knowledge in the form of Jinagam-proof, which is even greater than knowledge of the self. For this, the scriptures say that according to the general use of scriptures, a scripture-knower may mistakenly consider even a faulty (impure) food to be faultless (pure) and eat it. Even a self-knower would accept it as food, otherwise, the knowledge of the scriptures would become unproven. (Pi. Ni. 524)

The word of Shri Jinagam is also the destroyer of the existence (world) of noble beings. Therefore, it is said: "We hear that the Jinagam...

## The Greatness of Giving in the Field of Sadhus and Sadhvis

**Chapter 3, Light 119 of Yoga Shastra:** Even a single verse can lead to liberation. Countless beings have attained liberation by simply reciting a single Samayika verse. (Tattvarth Sutra | 27) Just as a sick person does not find bland food palatable, similarly, a person with a wrong view does not find the words of the Jinas palatable. However, there is no one else besides the words of the Jinas who can show the path to heaven or liberation. Therefore, it is appropriate for a person with right view to respect and have faith in the Agamas. Because the person who is destined for future well-being is the one who accepts the words of the Jinas with devotion. For others, these words are as painful as a thorn in the ear. Therefore, for those with opposing and faithless views, even nectar becomes poison. If there were no words of the Jinas in this world, people would fall into the abyss of ignorance without any order of Dharma and Adharma, and how would they be rescued from there?

"Whoever wants to cleanse their bowels should eat haritaki," a physician says. The one who eats haritaki believing in this statement of the physician experiences diarrhea due to its effect. The patient develops faith in the physician's words, and not only that, but he also starts considering Ayurveda as evidence. Similarly, when a person believes in the direct effects of the movement of the moon, sun, or planets, or in metallurgy, alchemy, etc., as mentioned in the Astanganimitta Shastra, he also accepts the statements related to indirect effects mentioned in those scriptures as authentic. Similarly, even if a person's intellect is dull in understanding the words of the Jinas, he should still accept the indirect effects mentioned in them, just like the direct effects, or even those effects that are not understood by sight or intellect, as true. In this difficult time, the intellect of people is becoming dull day by day, so that the words of the Jinas will almost be destroyed. Understanding this, the great men of the past, like Shri Nagarjuna, Shri Skandil Acharya (Shri Devarddigni Kshamasraman), etc., have written down the Agamas and made them available in book form. Therefore, a devout Shravak who respects the words of the Jinas should have these Agamas and other scriptures written down (published), wrapped in cloth, etc., and worship them with respect. Therefore, it is said: The person who has the words of Shri Jineshwaradeva, in the form of Agamas and other scriptures, written down (published), does not attain misfortune and does not become dumb, dull, or foolish in the future, and does not become blind or stupid, etc. The fortunate man who has the Jina Agamas written down (published) can undoubtedly attain liberation by becoming proficient in all scriptures. The one who studies or causes others to study the Jina Agamas should be honored with respect, including clothing, etc. It is also said: The person who reads the Jina Agamas himself, teaches others, and always gives clothes, food, books, or reading materials to those who read and teach, becomes knowledgeable about all substances or elements right here. Written scriptures and texts should be donated to Samvigna and Gitart Muni with great respect for study or lectures. If one wants to have a lecture on any Agama or text, one should listen to it with devotion and reverence every day. The conclusion is that one should use one's wealth to donate to the Jina Agamas and use it wisely.

**4. The Field of Sadhus:** The fourth right field is the assembly of Sadhus. According to the command of Shri Jineshwara Bhagwan, one should dedicate one's wealth to the service and devotion of the Sadhus, who are the keepers of right conduct, who make the rare human birth successful, who strive to cross the ocean of the world and help others cross it, from the Tirthankaras and Ganadharas to the present day, including the initiated Samayika-Samyami Sadhus. This can be done by providing the benevolent Sadhu Maharajas with pure, uncontaminated food, etc., as desired; medicines to cure diseases; clothes to protect from cold, heat, rain, illness, and shame; materials for copying and cleaning; vessels for eating, etc., and other auxiliary equipment like a staff, etc.; and houses, etc., for living. There is no object that is not beneficial for the livelihood of a Sadhu, depending on the substance, field, time, and feeling. Therefore, one should donate all objects that are conducive to their restraint. One should also dedicate one's sons and daughters to the Sadhus and Sadhvis, who are eager to be initiated into the path of the Sadhus and are detached from the world. What more can be said? One should provide whatever means are necessary for the Muni to practice their self-beneficial path to liberation without hindrance (pain).

## The Glory of the Seventh Shravakakshetra and the Mystery of the Mahashravakapad

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 119:**  One should give all imaginable resources with effort. However, if a Sadhu is against the words of the Jinas or if the resources are used to defame the Sadhu Dharma, one should stop it according to their ability. Therefore, it is said that a capable Shravak should not neglect a corrupt Sadhu due to the aforementioned reasons. Instead, they should try to guide them back to the original path by using favorable or unfavorable methods. (When you see that this Sadhu-Sadhvi is not worthy of guidance, then neglect them.)

**5. Sadhvi Kshetra:** In the Sadhvi Kshetra, which is adorned with the three jewels of knowledge, vision, and character, one should use their wealth by giving appropriate food and other things, just like for a Sadhu. Here, there is a doubt: "Women are devoid of sattva and have vices like bad character. Therefore, they do not have the right to attain liberation. How can the donation given to them be considered equal to the donation given to a Sadhu?" The solution is given as follows: The statement about women being devoid of sattva is false. Because many Sadhvis like Brahmi, etc., have left their homes and families to perform the unparalleled worship of Sadhu Dharma. It is not appropriate to call such great and powerful Sadhvis devoid of sattva. It is said that "Arya Brahmi, Sundari, Rajimati, Pravartiini Chandanbala, etc., who are famous for their character and sattva qualities, have been worshipped by gods and humans. How can women like Sati Sita, etc., who are famous for their beautiful sattva and pure character even in the household state, be called devoid of sattva or characterless? How can women like Satyabhama, etc., who have abandoned their attachments to the kingdom, wealth, husband, son, brother, and family, and have taken the burden of initiation, be called devoid of sattva?" (Stri Nirvana 34-36) Therefore, how can Sadhvis who are the worshippers of the three jewels, who protect their character even in the face of death, and who are full of sattva in performing severe austerities, be of bad character? Here, the question is raised again: "Due to great sins and falsehood, a being attains womanhood. Therefore, a being with right vision never attains womanhood. Then, how can the soul residing in a female body attain liberation?" In response, it is said: "This is not true. At the time of attaining right vision, the state of all karmas becomes less than a koti-koti sagaropam, and at that time, falsehood, delusion, etc., also cease to exist. There is no reason for sinful karma to occur with falsehood. As soon as a woman attains right vision, the rise of falsehood, etc., ends. Therefore, one cannot say that a woman cannot attain right vision, and one cannot say that a woman cannot practice liberation." It is also said: "Arya, meaning Sadhvi, knows the words of the Jinas, has faith in them, and follows character in its entirety. Therefore, liberation is not impossible for her." An unseen thing cannot be the cause of opposition. That is, it is not appropriate to consider liberation impossible for women without seeing the cause of its impossibility. (Stri Nirvana - 4) This proves that it is appropriate to invest one's wealth in Sadhvis who are embodiments of liberation practices, just like in Sadhus. One should understand this special point about serving Sadhvis: one should protect them from the traps of wicked atheists and provide them with a house, shelter, or a place to stay that is close to one's own home, secure on all sides, and has a secret door. Their service should be done by the women of one's own house. One should keep their daughters in contact with them, introduce them to them, and if one's daughter has a desire to take initiation, one should dedicate her without hesitation. If they forget any task that needs to be done, one should remind them. If a Sadhviji engages in wrong conduct, one should stop her politely. If one's daughters or the women of the house forget to serve them, one should warn them. If they do not listen even after repeated warnings, one should teach them. If they continue to make mistakes, one should rebuke them with harsh words. One should serve them by giving them appropriate things.

**6. Shravak Kshetra:** The sixth kshetra is that of the Shravak. One should invest their wealth in this kshetra. A Shravak is considered to be a fellow practitioner of the same Dharma. When the gathering of like-minded men occurs due to great merit, then what to say about serving them? On the occasions of the birth anniversaries, weddings, etc., of one's sons, daughters, etc., one should invite fellow practitioners.

The wealthy should give charity to the wealthy.
According to the third light of Yoga Shastra, verses 119 to 120, one should show devotion to them by giving them food, betel nut, clothes, ornaments, etc. If they face any calamity, one should save them by giving them their wealth. If their wealth is lost due to the rise of Antarayakarma, one should help them by providing them with employment or business. One should stabilize those who are falling in Dharma. If someone is negligent in Dharmacharan, one should remind them, stop them from going on the wrong path, inspire them, inspire them repeatedly, make them practice Dharma, and solve their doubts; repeat what they have read, discuss with them, engage them in Dharmakatha, etc. as appropriate, and if there is any special Dharma Anusthan or collective Dharma Kriya or collective Dharma Aradhana, one should take them along to every place, build a dispensary, etc.
7. Shravika Kshetra - The seventh Dharma Kshetra is the Shravika. One should also invest their wealth for the progress or excellence of the Shravika class, like the Shravak. One should not consider the Shravika to be any less or more than the Shravak. A woman, whether a widow or a widow, who is endowed with knowledge, vision, character, virtue, and contentment, who has affection for the Jain religion, should be considered a co-religionist sister, mother, or daughter. Here it is doubted that 'how can women follow virtue? And how can they be endowed with the three jewels? Because in worldly and transcendental behavior, and from experience, women are known as sinners. In reality, women are poisonous creepers born without land, lightning born without clouds, nameless diseases, untimely death, lionesses without caves, and direct demons. They are liars, courageous, and destroyers of brotherly love, and the cause of suffering. They are the main cause of lack of wisdom, so they should be avoided from afar. Then how is it appropriate to give them charity, honor them, and show affection towards them? In answer to this, it is said that 'it is not entirely true that women have more faults. This can also happen in men. There are also many men who are cruel, atheists, ungrateful, traitors, deceivers of masters, and deceivers of gods and gurus; seeing them, it is not appropriate to disrespect the great men. Similarly, it is not appropriate to defame the entire female gender by seeing such women. There are many women who are very sinful, and there are many women who are very virtuous. The mother of the Tirthankara is a woman; yet, due to her virtues and dignity, even Indra praises her, and the Munis also praise her. It is also said in the world that 'the young woman who carries a noble womb, attains the position of a guru in the three worlds.' For this reason, learned people have sung the praises of the mother's lineage without exaggeration. Many women, by the influence of their virtue, make fire as cool as water, snakes as ropes, rivers as land, and poison as nectar. The fourth limb of the Chaturvarna Chaturvidh Sangh is said to be the Grihastha Shravikas. The Tirthankara himself has praised the virtues of Shravikas like Sulasa, etc. The Indras have also repeatedly spoken of their characters in the Devalok with great respect, and even the powerful Mithyadrishti Devas have tried to distract them from Samyaktva, etc. Yet they did not waver. It is heard in the scriptures that some of them will attain liberation in the same birth, some will attain liberation after two or three births. Therefore, one should have affection towards them like a mother, like a sister, or like one's own daughter. This is the right behavior.
At the end of the fifth are, there will be a Sadhu, a Sadhvi, a Shravak, and a Shravika. They will be Duppasahasuri, Yakshini Sadhvi, Nagil Shravak, and Satyshri Shravika respectively. Therefore, why should that Shravika be defamed by calling her a sinful woman? For this reason, it is not appropriate to avoid the Shravika (Grihastha Sannaari) from afar, but one should have affection towards her. What more can be said? One is not called a Mahashravak just by investing wealth in the seven fields; but the one who spends wealth with compassion for the poor, the blind, the deaf, the lame, the sick, the poor, the suffering, etc.; not with devotion; he is the Mahashravak. It is said to give charity appropriately with devotion in the seven fields. For the extremely poor and suffering, one should invest their wealth only out of compassion, without considering the eligible and ineligible, and the conceivable and inconceivable.

## Description of the Daily Routine of a Mahashravak

The daily routine of a Mahashravak is described in the third light of Yogashastra, verses 120-121. At the time of initiation, the Tirthankaras, without any discrimination, gave annual donations out of compassion, regardless of whether the recipient was worthy or not. Therefore, one who, with devotion, invests their wealth in the seven fields, and with great compassion for the poor and suffering, should be called a Mahashravak.

Here, a doubt arises: why is such a person called a "Mahashravak" instead of just a "Shravak"? What is the purpose of adding the prefix "Maha"? The solution is that one who has unwavering right faith, or who observes even a single Anuvrat, or who listens to the words of the Jinas, is called a Shravak based on the etymological meaning. Therefore, it is said: "One who has attained right faith, who always listens to the teachings of the virtuous about the best Shravak dharma, is truly a Shravak." (Shra. Pra. Ga. 2) And one who, by contemplating the teachings of the Tirthankaras, strengthens their own faith, who daily sows the seeds of wealth in the field of worthy recipients, who destroys their sinful karma by serving the virtuous, can certainly be called a Shravak even today.

From this etymological explanation, the general meaning of Shravak is clear. However, the Shravak who diligently observes all the vows, who invests their wealth in the seven fields mentioned above, who promotes Jainism, who has immense compassion for the suffering beings, can be called a "Mahashravak" without any fault.

The need to invest wealth in the seven fields is supported by the following verse:

**Verse 120:**

"He who, even though possessing wealth, does not sow it in the external and impermanent fields, how can he practice the difficult and virtuous conduct?"

**Explanation:**

Why is the word "Sat" used as an adjective for wealth here? The answer is that "Sat" means "existing". It is possible to donate existing wealth; therefore, the word "Sat" is used. The body is an internal thing; compared to it, wealth is considered an external thing. It is impossible to abandon an internal thing; therefore, the adjective "external" is used. An external thing is not always permanent. Therefore, the adjective "impermanent" is used. Wealth can be stolen by thieves, destroyed by water, fire, family members, or kings. Therefore, the adjective "impermanent" is used. Even if it is kept with great effort, it will inevitably be destroyed when the merit associated with it is exhausted. Our Gurudev also says: "Thieves steal wealth, family members fight over it, kings take it by force or through taxes, fire burns it, water washes it away, or due to addiction, a person's wealth goes out the back door. Even if it is buried in the ground and kept safe, the Vyantar Devas can steal it, or at the time of death, a person leaves everything behind and goes to the next world." Therefore, even a small portion of impermanent wealth should be invested in some worthy field.

Just as oil, even if abundant, is not applied to a mountain, similarly, wealth, even if abundant, should not be wasted by giving it to just anyone. Therefore, it should be sown (invested) in the seven fields. It is said: "By sowing the seeds of wealth in the seven fields, it multiplies a hundred, a thousand, a lakh, or even a crore times. One who, even though possessing resources, does not invest their wealth or resources in the fields, is a poor soul. How can a great soul who has practiced evil conduct donate wealth in the seven fields? How can a person who has only gained wealth and is devoid of virtue, practice the conduct of renunciation of all attachments? The Shravak dharma is a magnificent palace, the fruit of which is the attainment of the Kalashaaropana."

**Now, we describe the daily routine of a Mahashravak:**

**Verse 121:**

"The Mahashravak should rise at Brahma Muhurta, reciting the praise of the Supreme Lord. Then, he should remember: 'What is my dharma? In what family was I born? And what are my vows?'"

##  Jain Temple Entry, Darshan, Puja Rituals and Doshas, and Stotras with Defects

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verses 122-123, Explanation:**

There are fifteen Muhurtas in a night. The fourteenth Muhurta is called Brahmah. In this Muhurta, one should abandon sleep and, for supreme auspiciousness, silently remember the five supreme beings (Panch Parameshthi) - Arihant, Siddha, etc. - with utmost reverence, reciting the Navkar Mantra, "Namo Arihantaṇam," etc., in a way that is not audible to others. Therefore, it is said that one should contemplate the Panch Parameshthi Namaskar Mantra in their mind, even while lying down or sitting. Because, by remembering it in the mind, there is no disrespect to the mantra. This mantra is extremely powerful and the best. Reciting this mantra while lying on a bed or sitting on a cot is disrespectful. Some other Acharyas believe that there is no harm in reciting it aloud. There is no situation where one does not have the right to recite the Panch Namaskar Mantra. Not only should one recite the Namaskar Mantra, but one should also be aware of their own Dharma, their lineage, and the vows they have taken. By inference, one should contemplate their Guru (from the perspective of substance), their village or city (from the perspective of location), the time of day (morning or evening), and their Dharma (from the perspective of feeling). One should remember their Jain Dharma, their lineage (Ikshvaku), and their vows (Anuvrata, etc.), and abandon thoughts contrary to Dharma. 

**Verse 122:**

* **Meaning:** After that, one should purify themselves by bathing, etc., and worship the Lord in their home temple with flowers, offerings, and stotras. Then, according to their ability, they should perform the Pacchakkhan of the Navkarsi, etc., and go to the larger Jain temple.

**Explanation:**

The scriptures do not refer to external purification like going to the toilet, cleaning one's mouth with a datun, removing dirt from the tongue, rinsing and washing one's mouth, bathing, etc., as these are common practices. Therefore, they are only mentioned here. There is no need to preach about common practices. The success of the scriptures lies in revealing what is not yet attained. There is no need for scriptures to tell someone with a dirty body to bathe or someone who is hungry to eat. The scriptures are useful in showing the path of Dharma in the world. The scriptures are the ultimate eye for those who are deprived of the light of knowledge in the natural darkness of attachment. In this way, one should understand that the teachings are successful in revealing what is not yet attained, and the scriptures cannot be considered as mere approval of common practices. Therefore, it is also said, "One who does not know the difference between virtuous (Savadhya) and sinful (Papa) words is not even fit to speak (about the scriptures), let alone have the right to preach." Therefore, leaving the matter of purity here, let us now come to the worship of Arihant Bhagwan in the home temple, which is a place of auspiciousness. Here, the different types of worship are explained: worship with flowers, offerings, and stotras. The word "flowers" here refers to all fragrant substances, such as ointments, incense, perfumes, and, by inference, clothes, ornaments, etc. "Amish" refers to offerings and drinks, such as cooked food, fruits, akshat, lamps, water, and vessels filled with ghee. "Stotras" refer to poems in the form of praise of the virtues of the good beings, such as the Shakrasthava (Namutthunan), etc. After that, one should recite the Pratyakhyan, such as the Namaskar with or without the Navkarsi, Porsi, etc., and the Adha form with the Ganthi, etc., according to their ability. Later, one should go to the Jineshwara temple, which is a place of devotion and a symbol of the Sangha. There, one should bathe, apply ointment, and apply tilak. For the wealthy, wearing weapons, ornaments, and decorations, riding in chariots, etc., are self-evident and do not need to be preached. The scriptures are meaningful in revealing what is already attained, as mentioned earlier. The method of entering the temple is as follows: If one is a king, they should go with all their wealth, all their virtues, all their army and family, all their power, etc., with great pomp and ceremony. If one is of ordinary wealth, they should go without false pretense, so as not to become a laughingstock among people.

**Verse 123:**

* **Meaning:** After entering the Jain temple according to the proper procedure, one should circumambulate the Lord three times, worship them with flowers, etc., and praise them with the best stotras.

## Explanation of the Iriya Vahiya Text

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 123 Explanation:**

One should enter the temple of the Lord with proper procedure and perform three circumambulations to Shri Jinendra Bhagwan. The entry procedure for the Shri Jin Mandir is as follows:

- Discard all objects with consciousness (satchitt) like flowers, betel nut, etc., and objects without consciousness (achitt) like knives, sandals, weapons, etc.
- Wear a single upper garment (uttarasang) and enter the temple.
- Upon seeing the Lord, join your palms in anjali mudra, place them on your forehead, focus your mind, and enter the temple while chanting "Nisihi Nisihi" five times.

This is also mentioned elsewhere:

- Discard objects with consciousness, keep objects without consciousness, wear a single, unbroken garment (uttarasang), and upon seeing the Lord with your eyes, join your palms on your forehead, focus your mind, and enter the temple. (Bhagavati 2)

If one is a king, they should discard their royal insignia upon entering the temple. (Vichar Saar, Verse 665)

Therefore, it is said:

- "Discard the five royal insignia - sword, umbrella, footwear (padtraan), crown, and fly whisk - upon entering the temple."

Here, "flowers" (pushpa) represents the middle term. Therefore, by the middle term, the beginning and end are also included.

By this logic, one should perform special worship with bathing (snatra) on daily and festival days.

During bathing, first apply fragrant sandalwood tilak to the Jin pratima, then apply musk, camphor, and sandalwood-mixed fragrant incense. (Arha Abhishek 3/77)

After placing the incense, put all medicinal herbs and other substances into a water-filled pot. Then, offer a flower offering (kusumaanjali) and bathe the Lord with water mixed with all medicinal herbs, camphor, saffron, sandalwood, agarwood, etc., and with ghee, milk, etc.

After that, grind sandalwood and apply it to the Lord. Then, worship the Lord with garlands of fragrant champa, satapatra, lotus, mogra, rose, etc.

After that, adorn the Lord with clothes, etc., decorated with jewels, gold, and pearls.

Then, draw the eight auspicious symbols (ashtamangal) in front of the Lord with mustard seeds, rice, and paddy.

Place offerings (naivedya), auspicious lamps (mangaldeep), yogurt, ghee, etc., in front of the Lord.

Apply a tilak of goorachan on the Lord's forehead. Then, perform the aarti.

Therefore, it is also said:

- "Worship the Lord with fragrant incense, water mixed with all medicinal herbs, fragrant sandalwood paste, excellent flower garlands, offerings, lamps, mustard seeds (siddharthak), yogurt, akshat, goorachan, etc., and with excellent substances like gold, pearl, and jewel necklaces."

Because worship performed with excellent materials manifests excellent emotions. Without this, Lakshmi cannot be used properly.

In this way, one should worship Shri Jinendra Bhagwan with devotion, perform the Iriya Vahiya Pratikraman, and chant the Shakrastava (Namutthunan) and other sutras.

One should praise the Lord's qualities with hymns composed by excellent poets.

The characteristics of an excellent hymn are:

- It describes the Lord's body, actions, and qualities.
- It is solemn.
- It is woven with various colors.
- It produces pure intentions.
- It increases devotion.
- It is pure and focused on confessing one's sins.
- It focuses the mind.
- It has amazing meaning.
- It is flawless.

Such hymns, composed by great wise poets, should be used to praise the Lord. (Shodashak 9/67)

However, hymns with the following flaws should not be recited:

- "One eye is closed due to deep meditation, and the other eye is fixed on Parvati's large buttocks due to the weight of the erotic sentiment. The third eye is burning with the fire of anger directed at Kamadeva, like a stretched bow from afar. In this way, may Shankar's three eyes protect you, experiencing different sentiments during meditation."

- Parvati asked Shankar, "Who is sitting on your head, fortunate one?" Shankar hid the truth and replied, "The moon." Parvati asked, "What is his name?" Shankar said, "His name is the same." Parvati said again, "Even after knowing so much, why did you forget his name? I am asking the name of a woman, not the moon!" Shankar said, "If you don't believe me, ask your friend Vijaya who is sitting on my head." In this way, Shankar deceitfully tried to hide the name of Ganga. May his deceit protect you.

- Bow down to Rudra, who, while being worshipped, takes on eleven forms - ten reflected in the mirror-like form of Parvati's feet, and himself.

- Kartikeya asked Parvati, "What is on my father's head?" She replied, "A piece of the moon." "And what is on his forehead?" "The third eye." "What is in his hand?" "A serpent."

## Explanation of the Iriya Vahiya Text

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 123**

While asking questions about Shivaji becoming a Digambar, Kartikeya is stopped by Parvati Devi with her left hand. May the sweet laughter of Parvati Devi protect you. And see further - at the end of the Suratkrida, standing with one hand firmly pressed on the Sheshnag, and with the other hand adjusting her garment, she holds her scattered locks of hair on her shoulders. At that time, with doubled beauty from her face, embraced by the affectionate Krishna, and again lying on the bed, the body of Lakshmi, adorned with lazy arms, will purify you. [Such verses should not be spoken in front of God]

These verses explain the entire method of worship. Its translation - 1. Three times sitting, 2. Three times circumambulation, 3. Three times prostration, 4. Three types of worship, 5. Contemplation of the three states of Jineshwar, 6. Not looking in any direction except Jineshwar, 7. Three times cleaning the feet and the ground, 8. Taking refuge in the three (varna, etc.), 9. Performing three types of mudras, and 10. Making three types of pranidhana. These ten are called 'Triks'. In this, there are three types of Jinpuja mentioned: Angapuja with flowers, Agrapuja with offerings, and Bhava puja with praise. And at this time, one should contemplate the three states of Jinenradeva: Chhadmastha, Kevali, and Siddhatva. Reciting the Chaityavandan Sutras, understanding their meaning, and taking refuge in the form of the image; this is called taking refuge in the Varna, etc. Trik. Concentrating the mind, speech, and body is called three types of pranidhana. While chanting the praise, the Yogamudra, while worshipping the Jinamudra, and while chanting the Pranidhana (Jay Viray) sutra, the Muktasukti Mudra, these are the three mudras mentioned. Prostration is done with five limbs: both knees, both hands, and the fifth, the forehead. Touching the ground with all five limbs is called Panchaang Pranam. Placing the ten fingers of both hands between each other, forming a shell-like shape of the palm, placing the elbows of both hands on the stomach, this is the Yogamudra. Standing with both feet equal, keeping a distance of four fingers in the front part between the soles of both feet and slightly less than four fingers in the back, and keeping both hands hanging down, this is the Jinamudra. And the fingers of both hands should be placed opposite each other, keeping the palm empty in the middle, and placing both hands on the forehead or, according to the opinion of other Acharyas, keeping them slightly away from the forehead, this is the Muktasukti Mudra. (Pancha. 3/17-21)

**Meaning of Iriya Vahiya Sutra**

After this, one should perform Chaityavandan with Iryapathik-Pratikraman. Here, the Iryapathik Sutra is explained. In this Sutra, from 'Ichchhami Padikka midam' to 'Tass Miccha Mi Dukkadam', the entire Sutra is there. In it, 'Ichchhami Padikka mium Iriya Vahiyae Virahanar', meaning, I desire to be free from the Viradhana (sinful actions) of living beings in going and coming. Its meaning is that Irya - means to go, to walk, to roam. The path for that is called Iryapatha, in which Viradhana in the form of killing living beings, etc., is Iryapatha-Viradhana. I want to retreat or escape from that sin. According to this explanation, Iryapathik Pratikraman is performed for the purification of the sin committed due to Viradhana in going and coming. But the Iriya Vahiya text is also spoken after waking up from sleep or for other reasons, therefore, it is explained in another way - Iryapatha means the conduct of a Sadhu. Here it is said that 'Iryapatho Maun Dhyanadhikham Bhikshuvratam'. Meaning, Iryapatha is the conduct of a Sadhu, such as silence, meditation, etc. From this perspective, the meaning of Iryapatha Viradhana is - if there has been any Viradhana in the form of violation of the conduct of a Sadhu, then I want to retreat from that sin or purify it. The meaning of violating the conduct of a Sadhu is - to separate the life of living beings, falsehood, theft, adultery, | attachment, etc., any sin from the eighteen sinful places. Among these, the sin of Pranatipat is the greatest sin, the rest of the sinful places are included in it. In the text related to Iryapathik Viradhana, Viradhana related to Pranatipat is mentioned in detail. What is the reason for Viradhana? It is called - Gamanaagaman, meaning going out for the purpose of going or coming back, and coming back to one's place after the purpose is fulfilled, is called Gamanaagaman. How does Viradhana occur in doing this Gamanaagaman? It is called - Panakkamane, Biyakkamane, Hariyakkamane, meaning to cause pain to all living beings, from Dwindriya to Panchendriya, with the feet, to transgress the life. And Bij, meaning all stationary one-sense living beings,

This is a refutation of the third light of Yoga Shastra, verse 123. It is a refutation of the killing of all types of green plants that are alive, Hariyakkamane. And it is a refutation of the killing of 'Osaunting-Panag-Dag-Matti-Makkada-Santana-Sankamane'. The water of dew (here the water of dew is taken because it is very subtle in the form of a point. Even that subtle Apkay should not be killed), 'Utting' means the donkey-shaped creature that lives in holes in the ground or the city of insects, Panag means the five-colored moss (Leelan-Pulansewal). Dagmatti means the mud of a place where people do not come and go, or to take the Apkay with the word Dag and the Prithvikaay with the word Matti. Makkada means a group of spiders and Santana means its web, Sankamane means an attack on it. In this way, how far should we count the beings according to their names? Therefore, it is said - "Je Me Jiwa Virahiya" - which means, "Which beings have I caused suffering to by killing them?" "Egindya" means a being with only the sense of touch, it is a one-sense being, like earth, water, fire, air and plant-bodied beings. "Beindya" means a being with touch and tongue, it is a two-sense being, like earthworms, conch shells, etc. "Teindya" means a being with touch, tongue and nose, it is a three-sense being, like ants, bedbugs, etc. "Chauridiya" means a being with touch, tongue, nose and eyes, it is a four-sense being, like bumblebees, flies, etc. "Panchindya" means beings with touch, tongue, nose, eyes and ears, they are the five-sense beings of Narak, Tithanch, Manushya and Dev, like animals, birds, rats, etc. It is a refutation of the killing of these Tiryanchjiva beings. The ten types of that refutation are called - "Abhihaya" means to have kicked them with the foot while they are coming in front of you or to have picked them up with the foot and thrown them away, "Vattia" means to collect them or to cover them with dust from above, "Lesia" means to stick them together, to drag them along the ground or to mix them with the ground, "Sanghaiya" means to gather them together, to trap one in another, "Sanghattia" means to touch them or to collide with each other, "Pariyavia" means to give them pain from all sides, "Kilamiya" means to be in a state like death, "Uddaviya" means to make them anxious, fearful and confused, "Thanaao Thanan Sankamiya" means to remove them from their place and put them in another place, "Jiviyao Vavaroviya" means to kill them, "Tass" means to have caused suffering to beings in ten ways from Abhihaya onwards, if my soul has been stained by the sin of that refutation, then for the purification of that sin, "Miccha Mi Dukkadam" means that my sin is false, it is nullified or destroyed.

**Explanation of the term "Miccha Mi Dukkadam" with its inherent meanings**

The preceptor, the former teacher, separates each word and explains it in this way:

"Mitti Miumaddavathe Chhattiy Dosan Chayan Hoei. Miti Amerae Thio Dutthi Duguchami Appaanam." (1)

"Katthi Kudam Me Pavam Datti Devemi Tam Uvasamenam. Eso Miccha-Dukkad-Payakkharattho Samaasenam." (2)

**Meaning:**

"Mi-chha-mi-du-kk-da-m" - these are six letters. The first 'Mi' has the inherent meaning of 'Mardava' or humility, in body and mind. The second letter 'chha' has the inherent meaning of 'cutting off' the faults that have been committed and the desire not to commit those faults again. The third letter 'mi' is 'Maryada' - to be steadfast in the moral rules of conduct. The fourth word 'du' has the inherent meaning of 'Dugucha' - to criticize one's own sinful soul. The fifth word 'k' means to confess one's own committed sins. And the sixth word 'd' means 'Dyan' - to pacify. In this way, the inherent meaning of the term 'Miccha Mi Dukkadam' is summarized.

Thus, by expounding the two types of atonement, namely criticism and repentance, now the following sutra is said with the desire for atonement in the form of Kayotsarga.

"Tass Uttarikarane-nam Payachchitt Karanenam Visohikarane-nam Visallikarane-nam Pavanan Kammanam Nigghayana-tthae Thami Kaussaggam."

"Tass" means the Iriyaavahhiya sutra from which criticism and repentance have been done, to purify that sin again,

Types of Chaityavandan

I perform Kausagg according to Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 123. This is how it should be done. Uttarikarana means - after purification from sins by Iriya Vahiya, for special purification. The meaning is that before Viradhana, Alochana-Pratikraman has been done; for the same, then Kayotsarga form of work is called Uttarikarana, by that Kayotsarga, destruction of sinful karmas happens. Uttarikarana happens by Prayaschittakarana. Therefore, it is said further - Payachchittakarana. Meaning, Praya = authorized, which purifies the mind or the soul, or cuts the sin, is called Prayaschitta. By doing which, the soul becomes specially pure. And that Kausagg-Prayaschitta is also the cause of purity, therefore it is said - Visohikarana, meaning by removing the excess dirt (offense), by making the soul pure and clean. That purity also happens in the absence of the thorn. Therefore, it is said - Visallikarana, meaning by being free from Maya-Shalya, Nidana-(Niyana) Shalya and Mithyadarshan-Shalya, these three thorns. Why? Pavana Kammanam Nigghayana Tthae, meaning to destroy the sinful karmas like Jnanavaraniya, which are the cause of the world. Thami Kausagg, Thami means - I do. And Kausagg means - the abandonment of the activities of the body, bodily tendencies. Do you abandon everything? Not at all, but some tendencies are kept as exceptions, in the form of Aagar (permission), I perform Kausagg. They are as follows - Annath Ussasienam Nissasienam, meaning - except for inhalation and exhalation. The meaning is that it is impossible to stop breathing, therefore permission is given to inhale and exhale. Khasienam - from coughing, Chienam - from sneezing, Jambhaienam - from yawning, Udduenam - from belching, Vayannisaggenam - from the expulsion of Apana Vayu, from Bhamali - sudden dizziness in the body, Pittmuchchae = fainting due to the heat of bile; Suhumehi Angsachalaihi - from the subtle movement of the limbs, from the fine movements of the body, Suhumeham Khelasanchalaihi - from the subtle movement of phlegm or saliva, Suhumehi Ditthisanchalaihi - from the subtle movement of the eyes, from the eyelids falling, etc., meaning - except for these twelve reasons, I abandon the activities of the body. What kind of Kayotsarga should it be? Evam Aihihim Aagarehihim Abhaggho Avirhaio Hujj Me Kausagg, meaning my Kayotsarga is unbroken, without Viradhana, with these and other types of aforementioned Aagars - exceptions. There are some accidental reasons, they should also be accepted. Meaning, when a cat is about to catch and eat a mouse, then to protect the mouse, suddenly lightning strikes, an earthquake happens, or there is a disturbance of fire, etc., when there is a touch of light, then to cover oneself with a blanket, if one takes it, then even if one opens the Kayotsarga in the middle, it does not break. Here the question arises - if one performs Kayotsarga by saying Namo Arihantaanam, and then performs bodily activities, then how will it break? Actually, doing so should not break the Kayotsarga. In answer to this, it is said - every Kausagg is supported by evidence. Although, until Namo Arihantaanam is not said, then Kausagg happens; however, as much as one has decided to perform the Kausagg of Logass or Navkar Mantra, it is said aloud only after completing it, then Kausagg happens in an unbroken and complete form. Even after Kausagg is complete, if Namo Arihantaanam is not said, then Kausagg breaks. Therefore, after Kayotsarga is complete, Namo Arihantaanam should be said. And if a cat is pouncing on a mouse, and one moves to save it, or performs bodily activities, then Kausagg does not break. And if a thief, a king, or a cause of fear arises in a secluded place, or if a snake has bitten oneself or another monk, then if one completes the Kayotsarga by suddenly uttering Namo Arihantaanam in the middle, then Kausagg does not break. It is said that from spreading, from burning, from a five-sense being passing through the middle, or from the disturbance of a thief, a king, etc., or from a snake bite; Kausagg does not break from these exceptions. The etymological meaning of Aagar is - Aakriyantae Aagruhyantae Ityakarah Aagarah. That which is done well or that which is accepted well, is called Aagar. The secret of Aagar is - the exceptions taken in Kayotsarga. If such Aagars are not there, then even if Kayotsarga is not completely broken or destroyed, it is broken (destroyed) in the country. While in Kayotsarga,

Explanation of the terms 'Arihant' and 'Bhagavan'

The Yogashastra, in the 123rd verse of the third chapter, states that the one who performs Kayotsarga (the posture of complete renunciation of the body) is not disturbed by any external factors. How long does this state last? It lasts until the person is able to recite the words 'Namo Arihantanam Bhagavatanam', i.e., until they can completely pay obeisance to the Arihants (the enlightened ones) and Bhagavans (the omniscient lords). 

During this time, the practitioner is required to stabilize their body, maintain silence, and focus their mind in meditation. This is done to withdraw the self from all impure activities and engage in auspicious contemplation. Some practitioners do not even utter the word 'Appana' (self) during this process. 

The recitation of 'Namo Arihantanam' after the completion of Kayotsarga, followed by the chanting of verses composed by great poets, constitutes the Chaitya-vandana (veneration of the enlightened ones). There are three types of Chaitya-vandana: the inferior one involves only obeisance, the medium one includes hymns and verses, and the superior one is performed with utmost reverence and detachment, accompanied by tears of joy.

The superior Chaitya-vandana is undertaken by fully renounced monks, lay followers, or non-returning right-believers, who sit on a well-prepared and purified ground, focus their eyes and mind on the image of the Tirthankara, and recite the Pranipata-dandaka-sutra (the scripture of prostration) with unwavering yogic posture, while remembering the meaning of the text.

The explanation of the 'Namotthuna' mantra is as follows: 'Namo' is a particle used for expressing reverence, 'Arihantanam' refers to the Arihants who are worthy of worship, and 'Bhagavatanam' refers to the Bhagavans who are omniscient lords. The term 'Asstu' means 'may it be so', indicating that this prayer is the seed of the tree of dharma. The 'Nam' is used as a figure of speech. The superior Chaitya-vandana ritual, as described here, is not widely practiced in the present time.

## A Discussion on the Terms Arihant and Bhagwan

**Chapter 3, Light 123 of the Yoga Shastra**

Where the term Arihant is used, it means "destroyer of enemies." The enemies are the karmas like Mithyatva, Mohaniya, etc., which are the cause of bondage. Arihants are called so because they destroy these karmic enemies, which cause immense suffering of birth and death in countless lifetimes.

**Third Explanation:** Arihant means "one who destroys the dust." Here, dust refers to the four ghati karmas. Just as the sun, even when hidden behind clouds, does not appear bright, similarly, the soul, covered by the dust of the four ghati karmas, does not reveal its inherent qualities of knowledge, perception, etc. Therefore, those who destroy the dust of ghati karmas, which cover the soul's qualities, are called Arihants.

**Fourth Explanation:** Arihant also means "one who has no secrets." The knowledge and perception qualities of Bhagwan are dependent on karmas like Jnana Avaraniya, etc. By completely destroying these karmas, they attain complete, infinite, wondrous, unparalleled, eternal Keval Jnana and Keval Darshan. Through these, they know and see the entire universe simultaneously. Therefore, nothing remains hidden from them, and hence they are called Arihants.

These three explanations are based on the "Pṛṣodaraadayaḥ Sutra" of grammar, which defines the word "Arhat" in three ways.

Alternatively, "Raha" means a secluded place, a mountain cave, a location, a country, or its end or middle. The word "A" signifies the absence of something. Therefore, those who are omniscient and all-knowing, for whom no country or place remains secluded or hidden, and from whom nothing remains concealed, are called Arihants.

Another interpretation is "Arhadbhyah," which means "one who is free from attachment." It means that due to the weakening of raga, they have no attachment to any object.

Alternatively, even when they come in contact with objects of desire or aversion, which are the causes of raga and dvesha, they do not abandon their nature of being free from raga, etc. Therefore, they are called Arihants.

Another reading is "Arihantaanam," which means "one who destroys the enemies in the form of karmas." It is said, "Eight types of karmas are the enemies of all beings." Those who destroy these karmic enemies are called Arihants. (A. Ni. 929)

Another reading is "Aruhantaanam (Arohadbhyah)," which means "one whose sprouts of samsara do not rise again due to the weakening of karmic seeds." Alternatively, those who are not going to be born again in samsara are also called Arihants. It is said, "Just as a sprout does not appear when the seed is completely burnt, similarly, the sprout of bhava does not appear when the karmic seed is completely burnt," meaning there is no birth and death. (Tattvarth Karika 8)

Grammarians have considered three forms of the word "Arhat" in Prakrit language: 1. Arhat, 2. Arihant, and 3. Aruhant. We have also established these three forms based on the "Uccahati" Sutra of Siddha Hema Vyākaraṇa. (8.2.11)

"Salutations to those Arihants." It is important to understand this connection.

"Namotthunanam" - In "Namo'stu," the word "Namah" takes the fourth case, but according to the Sutra "Chaturthyaah Shashthi" (8.3.131), the sixth case is used in place of the fourth case in Prakrit language.

The use of the plural form is to refute those who believe in only one Supreme Being. It is used to prove that there are many Arihant Supreme Beings, refuting the monotheistic view of Advaita. It is also used to show that saluting many Arihants yields more benefits than saluting one.

The term "Bhagwantaanam" is used to indicate that I am saluting the Arihant Bhagwan, who are different in their names, establishments, substances, and qualities.

"Bhag" has fourteen meanings. They are: 1. Sun, 2. Knowledge, 3. Greatness, 4. Fame, 5. Detachment, 6. Liberation, 7. Form, 8. Strength, 9. Effort, 10. Desire, 11. Glory, 12. Dharma, 13. Power, and 14. Womb. Of these, all except the meanings of "Sun" and "Womb" are valid here. One who possesses "Bhag" - knowledge, detachment, etc. - is called Bhagwan.

... The text then explains the meanings of "Bhag" in the life of Bhagwan:

1. **Knowledge:** From the time of conception until initiation, Bhagwan possesses three types of knowledge: Mati, Shruta, and Avadhi. After initiation, until the destruction of ghati karmas, the fourth type of knowledge, Manah Paryavgyan, also remains. After the destruction of ghati karmas, they attain Keval Jnana, which illuminates all things.

2. **Greatness:** Greatness means extraordinary influence. During all the auspicious events of Bhagwan, hell...

##  Namoththuna (Shakrastava) Commentary

**Chapter 3, Verse 123 of the Yoga Shastra:**  Even for beings, happiness is generated, and even in the deepest darkness of hell, light shines. When the Lord enters the womb, wealth, prosperity, etc., increase in the family; even the unyielding feudal kings begin to bow. And famines, epidemics, etc., are eliminated, resulting in a state free from enmity, and the country and its people are free from calamities like excessive rain, drought, etc. Due to their influence, the throne moves, and gods, asuras, etc., bow down to their lotus feet. Thus, they are extremely influential.

**3. Fame:** By conquering raga-dvesha, parishaha, upsarga, etc., with valor, the Lord gains fame, and their reputation is always permanent. The celestial nymphs in the heavens and the serpent maidens in the netherworld sing songs of their fame. Gods and asuras constantly praise that fame.

**4. Detachment:** Even while enjoying the wealth and prosperity of gods and kings, the Lord does not have even a trace of attachment. When they accept initiation, they renounce all enjoyments and wealth and prosperity. What benefit do they derive from that wealth then? When karmas are exhausted, they are indifferent to pleasure and pain, to the world and liberation. Thus, the Lord is detached in all three states. This is what we have also said in the Vitaragastotra: "O Lord! When you enjoy the wealth of gods and kings, you do not experience even a trace of joy. Even then, your delight remains in detachment. Being detached from sensual pleasures, you have abundant detachment, and you remain indifferent to pleasure and pain, or to the world and liberation. Even then, you remain detached. In what state are you not detached? You are detached in all states."

**5. Liberation:** Liberation, in the form of the complete destruction of all afflictions, is always close to you.

**6. Form:** Your form is truly supreme. It is said that if one gathers the essence of the forms of all the gods into a single thumb, and compares it to the thumb of the Lord's foot, the form of the gods appears like coals in a burning ember. Therefore, the Lord's form is the most excellent.

**7. Vigor:** The Lord has the power to make Mount Meru a staff and the earth a canopy. It is heard that, soon after birth, Shri Mahavira Prabhu moved the big toe of his left foot to dispel the fear of Indra. Such is the vigor (power) and valor of the Lord.

**8. Effort:** The effort born from supreme vigor, which was so immense in the determination to destroy the karmas of the great images and the acceptance of the vows in a single night, etc.! And the yoga-nirodha of mind, speech, and body, and the excellent self-vigor manifested in that yoga, the unshakeable state like Mount Meru; and the effort born from the excellent self-vigor in the form of the manifestation of Shaileshikarana.

**9. Desire:** In the birth cycle, in the state of a god and in the state of a Tirthankara, there is an intense desire to liberate the world, which is immersed in the mud of suffering.

**10. Wealth:** You are filled with the complete knowledge of Kevala Jnana, which is the wealth obtained through valor by destroying the deadly karmas. This wealth of happiness is also unparalleled.

**11. Dharma:** You possess the great yoga-like Dharma in the form of Anasrava. The practice of Dharma in the form of the exhaustion of all karmas is even more excellent.

**12. Power:** The Samavasarana created by Indra and other gods due to their extreme devotion to the Lord, and the power in the form of Ashta-Pratihariya, etc., are possessed by the Tirthankara Lord. Thus, the praiseworthy qualities, consisting of twelve aspects like knowledge, etc., are spoken of by the wise.

In this way, from the two Alapaka (verses), one should understand the first aspect of the "Namoththuna" sutra, which is the object of praise, why, and how. We have said enough about this. Now we describe the second aspect, the reason for praise.

**Aigrana Tithyayarana Sayansambuddhana:** What is the meaning of Aigrana? It means "the one who initiates," i.e., the one who gives the first teachings of all kinds of ethics and Shruta Dharma. From this power, Shruta Dharma is known from them. Although it is said that the Dvadasanga was never, is not, and will never be, this is not true. And because the Dvadasanga was, is, and will be, it is called eternal. However, from the perspective of meaning, it is called eternal, and from the perspective of words, because the Dvadasanga is created in the reign of each Tirthankara, there is no contradiction in saying "the one who initiates Shruta Dharma."

Those who believe that liberation happens immediately upon attaining Kevala Jnana do not accept the Tirthankara. They say that Kevala Jnana does not occur until all karmas are exhausted. Due to this statement, the reason for the existence of the Tirthankara does not remain. Therefore, to refute this, it is said...

This is verse 123 from the third chapter of the Yoga Shastra. It says: "Those who establish the Tirtha are called Tirthankaras." A Tirtha is that which helps one cross the ocean of Samsara (the cycle of birth and death). The four-fold Sangha, consisting of Sadhus, Sadhvis, Shravaks, and Shravikas, is the foundation of the Tirtha, as is the first Ganadhara. 

The Bhagavan Mahavira was asked, "O Bhagavan, who is a Tirtha?" He replied, "O Tirtha-rupa Gautam, the Tirthankara is the Tirtha. By this rule, the Arihant is the Tirtha, the four-fold Shri-Sangha is the Tirtha, and the first Ganadhara is the Tirtha." (Bhagavati 20/8)

Those who establish or create the Tirtha are called Tirthankaras.  Kevalgyan (omniscience) arises only when all karmas are destroyed. This is not true, however, as Kevalgyan arises when the four ghatikarma (destructive karmas) are completely destroyed. The four aghatikarma (non-destructive karmas) remain in the Kevali, but they do not hinder his Kevalgyan. Kevalgyan is revealed when the four ghatikarma, including Gyanavaraniya, are destroyed. Only the Arhat Kevalgyani can establish the Tirtha.  

The liberated Kevalis, or those who have attained liberation by destroying all eight karmas simultaneously, cannot become Tirthankaras. Therefore, it is said, "Salutations to the Tirthankaras who establish the Tirtha."

Many people say that these Tirthankaras attain Bodhi-gyan (enlightenment) through the grace of Sadashiva. Their scriptures provide evidence for this: "Maheshanugrahat Bodhi-niyamaviti," meaning, "Through the grace of Mahesh, Bodhi-gyan and (Shouch, Santosh, Tap, Swadhyay, Dhyan) are attained." However, this statement is not true. Therefore, it is said, "Sayansambuddhanam," meaning, "They become self-enlightened (Sambuddha) by themselves, without the teachings of others, due to the maturity of their Bhavyatva (potential for liberation) and other qualities. They know the true nature of reality." Therefore, salutations to those who have attained enlightenment by themselves.

Although they attain enlightenment through the teachings of their Gurus in their previous births, in their Tirthankara-bhavas (lives as Tirthankaras), they are independent of the teachings of others. They attain enlightenment by themselves. Although in the Tirthankara's bhavas, the Lokantik Devas (celestial beings) say, "Bhayavan Tittham Pavatteh," meaning, "O Bhagavan, you should engage in establishing the Tirtha," the Bhagavan accepts the initiation. However, just as a king acts or departs based on the words of the Kalgyanpak-Vaitalik (astrologer), the Tirthankaras accept initiation voluntarily based on the request of the Devas, not their teachings.

Having explained the general qualities of the one worthy of praise, we now explain the specific qualities: "Purishuttamanam, Purisisihanam, Purisavarapundariyanam, Purisavaragandhatthyanam." This means, "Purish" refers to one who resides in the body, hence called "Purush." Those who reside in a body with an excellent form due to the rise of specific virtuous karmas, and who are also excellent beings by nature and superior in Bhavyatva and other qualities, are called "Purushottama." These Purushottama are as follows:

* They are accustomed to helping others until the end of their Samsara.
* Their worldly pleasures are secondary to them.
* They act appropriately in all situations.
* They never become humble.
* They begin only those tasks in which they can succeed.
* They think deeply and resolutely.
* They are masters of gratitude.
* They have a mind free from suffering.
* They have the utmost respect for Devas and Gurus.
* Their intentions are serious.

A rough and unpolished gem of the highest quality, even when extracted from the mine, is superior to glass. However, when it is polished and shaped, it becomes even more beautiful, and then there is no comparison to glass. Similarly, there is no comparison to the Arihant Paramatma. They are superior to all.

This refutes the belief of the Buddhists who say, "Nasti ih kashchidabhajnam sattvah," meaning, "There is no being in this world who is unworthy." All beings are worthy of all virtues. Therefore, all beings can become Buddhas. This is refuted because all beings cannot become Arihants; only Bhavyas can become Arihants.

The disciples of the Sanskrit Acharya, who believe in the reality of external objects and the unreality of metaphors, say, "Those who are worthy of praise cannot be compared to anything, because Heenaadhikaabhyamupma mrishya," meaning, "It is false to compare the worthy of praise to something inferior or superior." To refute this view, it is said, "Purishisihanam," meaning, "Like a lion among men." Just as a lion possesses courage, ferocity, bravery, patience, and other qualities, the Arihant Bhagavan is also courageous in overcoming enemies in the form of karmas, fierce in destroying karmas, invincible in not tolerating anger, which is the result of defeat, a great warrior who is not defeated by attachment, etc., powerful, energetic, and famous for his bravery in austerity. They disregard the opinions of others, are not afraid of upsargas (obstacles), do not worry about nourishing their senses, do not regret walking the path of restraint, and remain steadfast in good thoughts. Therefore, due to these qualities, the Arihant Bhagavan is like a lion among men.

## Explanation of Namotthu

This is similar to the third light verse 123 of Yoga Shastra. This statement is not false either; because by giving similes like a lion, etc., their extraordinary qualities appear. God should be compared to his own kind, not to a different kind, because "Viruddhopamayogé Taddharmapattyá Tadavastutvam" - that is, by the use of a contradictory (heterogeneous) simile, the qualities of the simile are transferred to the object being compared, thus negating its true nature. By this logic, if the qualities of the simile are transferred to the object being compared, then God would lack masculinity, etc. Refuting this view of the Charu disciples, it is said - "Purisa Varapundariyáṇam" - that is, even though he is a man, salutations to the Arihant who is like the best lotus.  

The Arihant is like the best lotus, as the lotus is born in mud, grows in water, yet transcends both and remains above them. It is naturally beautiful, the abode of the Lakshmi of the three worlds, a home of joy for the eyes, etc. Due to its excellent qualities, even the exceptional animals, humans, and gods enjoy the lotus; and the lotus is the cause of happiness. Similarly, the Arihant, the Supreme Being, is born in the mud of karma, grows with the water of divine enjoyment, yet transcends both and remains detached from them. Due to their excellences, they are beautiful and the abode of wealth in the form of qualities; they are the cause of supreme bliss; due to their qualities like omniscience, etc., even animals, humans, and gods serve them, and through this, they become the cause of liberation happiness. For these reasons, the Arihant God is like the lotus. Thus, even when comparing to a different kind like the lotus, there is no contradiction in meaning. The fault that the disciples of Sucharu have pointed out by comparing to a different kind, is not possible here. If by comparing to a different kind, other qualities are also transferred to the object being compared, in the same way, by comparing to the same kind like a lion, etc., the qualities of animality, etc., of that lion, etc., are transferred. But this does not happen with a simile of the same kind; similarly, that fault does not apply to a simile of a different kind.

The disciples of Brihaspati believe that qualities should be described in a progressive order. That is, first, the general qualities should be described, then the more specific qualities, and then the even more specific qualities, in a progressive order. If this order is not followed in the explanation, then the subject matter becomes disordered, and then the qualities increase progressively. In support of this, they say - "Akramvadassat" - that is, what does not develop progressively is false (mithya). The qualities of the Arihant, the Supreme Being, have also developed progressively. To explain this, first, a general simile should be given, then a specific simile. To refute their view, it is said - "Purisa Varagandhahatthiṇam" - that is, the Arihant God, even though he is a man, is like the best gandhahasti (a type of elephant). Just as the mere smell of the gandhahasti makes the small elephants roaming in that region flee, in the same way, due to the influence of the Arihant, the attacks of foreign kingdoms, famine, epidemics, etc., which are like small elephants, flee from the smell of their walk, which is like the wind. For this reason, the God is like the best gandhahasti. Here, first, the simile of a lion, then the lotus, and then the gandhahasti is given. In this, the gandhahasti is stronger than the lion; while the lotus is ordinary. Therefore, according to their view, the simile is out of order, yet it is not a fault, because they say that "if there is no order in the explanation, then the explanation itself is false." This is not logical. In reality, whether general or specific, all qualities are relative to each other in the soul. Therefore, whether those qualities or the God possessing them are praised in order or in reverse order, there is no fault in it. Thus, the special reason for praising the Arihant God through the four phrases "Purisa Uttmaṇam" etc. is stated. In this way, this third wealth is called "Stotavya Vishesh Hetu Sampada."

Now, to explain how the praiseworthy, passionless Supreme Being is useful in this world in general, the fourth wealth is described in five phrases - "Loguttmaṇam, Lognahaṇam, Loghiyaṇam, Logpaivaṇam, Logpajjogaraṇam." According to grammar, the word that is the denotation of a group of words is also the denotation of many parts (parts or divisions). The word "Lok" literally denotes the fourteen royal lokas, which are a group of five astikayas, including Dharmaastikaya. And conversely, where there is a lack of Dharmaastikaya, etc., substances, only space, is called "Alok." However, here, the word "Lok" should be understood as the Lok in the form of the Sarvabhavya Jiva. Here, the God is called "Lokottama"

## Explanation of Namotthuna (Shakrastava)

This is verse 123 from the third chapter of Yogashastra.  True excellence exists only among those of the same species. There is no special distinction in excellence between a lower caste and a higher caste.  While all bhavya jivas are superior to abhavya jivas, there is no special distinction in pointing out the superiority of the Bhagavan in comparison to them. Therefore, the statement here is that he is superior among the bhavya jivas of the same species.  Because the feeling of bhavya-tva, which is the cause of all well-being, exists only in Bhagavan among all bhavya jivas.  Salutations to the Bhagavan, who is the best in this world.

**Loka-nahan** means the lord of the world.  The lord who does yoga-kshema.  Yoga is to obtain what is not obtained, and kshema is to protect what is obtained.  From this perspective, Bhagavan establishes the seed of dharma in the world, causing the attainment of the unattained dharma and protecting it from the disturbances of raga, etc.  Therefore, he is the lord of the bhavya jiva world.  

However, Bhagavan is not called the lord of the world in comparison to all bhavya jivas.  Because Bhagavan cannot be the doer of yoga-kshema for those who are bhavya by birth (jati).  If that were the case, all beings would attain liberation.  Therefore, Bhagavan can only be the doer of yoga-kshema for those bhavya jivas who are close to liberation.  Bhagavan does yoga by establishing the seed of dharma in such bhavya jivas, causing the emergence of the sprout of dharma and nourishing it.  He does kshema by protecting them from the disturbances of internal enemies like raga, dvesha, etc.  In other words, salutations to the lord of that specific world of bhavya jivas.

**Loka-hiyan** means salutations to the one who benefits the world.  Here, the word "loka" should be understood as the world of all beings, from the one-sense beings to the five-sense beings, in the fourteen realms of existence.  Because Bhagavan saves all beings from falling into suffering by teaching the path of liberation, which includes samyag darshan, etc., he is the well-wisher of the world.

**Loka-paivahan** means salutations to Bhagavan, who illuminates the world like a lamp.  Here, the word "loka" should be understood as the world of the specific five-sense beings, because Bhagavan illuminates the five-sense beings with the rays of knowledge from his teachings, removing the darkness of mithyatva and ignorance, and illuminating the knowledge-object appropriately.  Therefore, he is like a lamp because he is the illuminator of the world of beings with knowledge.  Just as a lamp cannot illuminate a blind person, Bhagavan cannot awaken those beings with knowledge who are immersed in the deep darkness of mithyatva.  Therefore, Bhagavan is called like a lamp in the world of specific beings with knowledge.

**Loka-pajjogaran** means salutations to Bhagavan, who shines like the sun in the world.  Here, the word "loka" should be understood as the specific fourteen previous knowledgeable beings (purva-dharas).  Because only they can have true brilliance.  And only they can truly know the seven or nine elements of jiva, etc., which are worthy of illumination.  Only the purva-dharas are endowed with special qualifications.  However, all purva-dharas are not equal in illuminating the elements.  Because even the purva-dharas are different in their qualifications, with more or less of the six stages (shat-sthana).  The meaning of "pradyot" is the illumination of the complete knowledge of the elements, specifically through the eyes, etc.  This qualification exists only in the specific fourteen purva-dharas.  Therefore, Bhagavan is like the sun in the world of the specific fourteen purva-dharas.  Just as lotuses bloom from the sun, the specific purva-dharas are illuminated with the knowledge of the elements of jiva, etc., because of Bhagavan, the sun.  From this perspective, Bhagavan is the illuminator of the world.

In this way, Bhagavan is a benefactor in five ways: loka-uttama, etc.  Therefore, the fourth pancha-padi sampada is described as the general use of the wealth of being worthy of praise.  Now, the fifth sampada, called hetu-sampada, is described from the perspective of describing the wealth of specific use: "abhaya-dayan, chakkhu-dayan, magg-dayan, saran-dayan, bohi-dayan."  The first, "abhaya-dayan," means salutations to Bhagavan, the giver of fearlessness.  Fear is mainly of seven types: 1. fear of this world, 2. fear of the next world, 3. fear of attachment, 4. fear of the unexpected, 5. fear of livelihood, 6. fear of death, and 7. fear of disgrace.  The opposite of fear is fearlessness, which is the absence of fear.  In other words, the substance that is the cause of the complete well-being of the specific health of the soul is called fearlessness.  Some call it courage.  It is Sri Tirthankara Bhagavan who gives this kind of fearlessness, because he is endowed with inconceivable power due to the excellence of his qualities.  And because he is solely dedicated to the welfare of others, Bhagavan is also the giver of fearlessness, the remover of fear.

**Chakkhu-dayan** means salutations to the giver of eyes.  Bhagavan is the giver of the eye of the specific dharma of the soul, which is the knowledge of the elements.  Other people call it faith.  Just as a person without eyes cannot see others,

## Explanation of the Verse

**Verse 123 of the Third Light of Yoga Shastra:** Just as a person without faith is incapable of seeing the truth of the self, similarly, a person without faith is incapable of attaining happiness. Only with true faith (Shraddha) can one attain knowledge and vision of the true nature of reality. Therefore, faith, like an indestructible seed, is obtained from the Lord, who is the giver of the tree of Dharma. Hence, salutations to the Lord, the giver of vision.

**Mārgadāyāṇam:** Salutations to the Lord, the giver of the path to liberation. Here, the guide refers to one who leads to the specific and direct series of Gunasthanas (stages of spiritual progress), like the straight path of a serpent's hood; one who enables the experience of the true self (Atmasvaroop); one who reveals the nature of the cessation of karma. The path is that which leads the mind towards liberation, where the mind's tendencies are conducive to liberation. Without the path to liberation, the mind's tendencies cannot be pure or conducive. Happiness also arises from walking on the path to liberation. Without the path to liberation, one cannot attain the appropriate Gunasthanas, because the unevenness of the path causes the mind to slip, and this becomes an obstacle in attaining the Gunasthanas. Such a simple and true path is obtained only from the Lord, therefore, the Lord is the guide.

**Saraṇadāyāṇam:** Salutations to the Lord, the giver of refuge. Protecting the one who is suffering from fear is called giving refuge. In this world, which is like a terrifying forest, the souls of beings afflicted by intense attachment, aversion, etc., become deluded by the mental afflictions arising from the cycle of suffering. The Lord gives them the beautiful assurance of the determination of true contemplation; therefore, they are the refuge. Other Acharyas say that the desire to know the truth is refuge. This determination of true contemplation is the cause of the soul attaining the truth. 1. Desire to hear the truth, 2. Hearing the truth, 3. Accepting the truth, 4. Holding the truth in the heart, 5. Attaining specific knowledge (Vijnana) from this, 6. Reasoning and thinking from Vijnana, 7. Deciding on the truth, and 8. Having firm faith in the truth; these eight qualities of the intellect are manifested by the determination of true contemplation. If there is no determination of true contemplation, these qualities do not manifest, but only their appearance is seen, which does not achieve any purpose for the soul. Therefore, the refuge of true contemplation, which gives assurance to the soul, bewildered by many sorrows, and illuminates the qualities of the intellect, is obtained only from the Lord. Therefore, the Lord is the giver of refuge.

**Bodhidāyāṇam:** Salutations to the Lord, the giver of enlightenment. Enlightenment means attaining the Dharma as established by Lord Jineshwar. Enlightenment occurs through the power of three actions: Yathapravrittikaran (making things happen as they should), Apurvakaran (doing something new), and Anivrittikaran (stopping something from happening). The first time the knot of attachment and aversion, which has never been broken before, is broken, the soul attains Samyagdarshan (right faith) in the form of true faith in the truth. Other Acharyas have called 'Bodhi' as 'Vijnpti'.

**Abhaya, Chakshu, Marg, Sharan, and Bodhi:** These five are obtained by the one who is free from rebirth. When these five are not manifested in their true form due to rebirth, the Lord gives these five non-rebirth-causing qualities. These five qualities are the fruits of the previous ones, one after the other. It is like this: the fruit of giving fearlessness is the attainment of vision, the fruit of vision is the attainment of the right path, the fruit of the path is the attainment of refuge, and the fruit of refuge is the attainment of enlightenment (Samyagdristi). This seed of enlightenment is obtained from the Lord. Therefore, the Lord is the giver of enlightenment. Thus, the Lord is the giver of fearlessness, the giver of vision, the giver of the path, the giver of refuge, and the giver of enlightenment. Therefore, as mentioned earlier, the accomplishment of the wealth of use has been achieved. Now, we will explain the wealth of praise, which is a specific use of wealth.

**Dhammadāyāṇam, Dhammadeśayāṇam, Dhammānāyāgaṇam, Dhammāsārāhīṇam, Dhammāvarachaurantachakkavattīṇam:** The meaning of 'Dhammadāyāṇam' is - Salutations to the Lord, the giver of Dharma. Here, Dharma should be understood as the Dharma in the form of conduct (Virati). And that Dharma is of two types: Sadhudharma and Shravakdharma. Sadhudharma is the form of abandoning all sinful actions, while Shravakdharma is the form of partially abandoning sin. The Lord is the one who reveals both these Dharmas. Dharma can only be obtained from Him. Even if there are other causes, the Lord is the main cause in attaining Virati Dharma, therefore, the Lord is called the giver of Dharma. The giver of Dharma is the one who gives Dharmadeshana, not any other cause, therefore, it is said - 'Dhammadeśayāṇam' = Salutations to the Lord, the preacher of Dharma. As mentioned earlier, the Lord is the preacher of the two types of Virati Dharma.

##  An Explanation of Namostuthunam

This is an explanation of the Namostuthunam, a hymn of praise to the Jinas. It is found in the third chapter of the Yoga Shastra, verse 123.

**The hymn states that the teachings of the Jinas are never fruitless, but always bear fruit.** This is because the Jinas teach according to the capacity of the individual. Therefore, the Jinas are true teachers of Dharma.

**The hymn then salutes the Jinas as the "Dhammanayaga" - the leaders of Dharma.** This is because they have fully realized Dharma, lived it perfectly, and are experiencing its ultimate fruits. They are free from any obstacles or hindrances to Dharma, making them the true leaders of Dharma.

**The hymn also salutes the Jinas as the "Dhammsarhi" - the charioteers of Dharma.** This is because they themselves practice and guide others in the practice of Dharma, and they control their senses and help others to do the same. They are the true charioteers of the chariot of Dharma.

**The hymn further salutes the Jinas as the "Dhammvarachaurantchakkavatti" - the supreme, four-cornered Dharmachakravartin (wheel-turner).** Here, Dharma refers to the practice of right conduct (charitra dharma). This Dharma is pure, free from any impurities, defilements, or suffering. It is superior to the Dharmachakra described by the Buddhists, as the Dharmachakra of the Jinas benefits both this world and the next, while the Buddhist Dharmachakra only benefits this world. This Dharmachakra is also supreme because it is four-cornered, meaning it ends the cycle of birth and death in the four realms of existence: hell, animal, human, and god. It is also like a wheel because it destroys the enemies of the soul, such as anger, delusion, and false belief. Thus, the Jinas are the supreme Dharmachakravartins, the founders of the supreme, four-cornered Dharmachakra.

**The hymn then explains that this sixth attribute of the Jinas, their "special name," is a testament to their special usefulness, which is further demonstrated by their five other attributes: "Dharmadata" (giver of Dharma), etc.**

**The hymn then refutes the Buddhist belief that the omniscient (kevala) being does not know everything, but only knows the "desired" things.** The Buddhists argue that knowing only the "desired" things is enough for an omniscient being, and that knowing the number of insects, for example, is irrelevant. The hymn refutes this by saluting the Jinas as the "Appdihi-varnana-dasan-dharana" - the holders of unhindered (unbroken) knowledge and vision.

**The hymn explains that the Jinas are called "unhindered" because their knowledge and vision are not limited by any substance, space, time, or state of being.** They are permanent and unlimited. They are also called "unhindered" because they have shed all the karmic coverings, revealing their true nature, which is characterized by perfect knowledge and vision. The Jinas are free from all coverings of knowledge and vision, and they have knowledge and vision of all things.

**The hymn then addresses the argument of some philosophers who believe that the Jinas are "chhadmastha" (worldly) even though they are omniscient.** These philosophers argue that the Jinas, after attaining liberation, return to the world to protect the Dharma. They say that the Jinas, whose karmic fuel has been burnt and who have destroyed the cycle of birth and death, return to the world out of fear that someone might destroy the Dharma they established. This, they argue, makes the Jinas' liberation unstable, as they are both liberated and worldly.

**The hymn refutes this argument by saluting the Jinas as the "Viattchhaumanam" - those who have shed the "chhadma" (worldly) state.** The hymn explains that the Jinas have shed the karmic coverings that obscure their true nature, and they have also shed the "chhadma" state, which is the state of being bound by karma and the impure, worldly state. The Jinas have no reason to return to the world after liberation, as they have destroyed the cycle of birth and death.

**The hymn then addresses the argument that the Jinas return to the world to defeat those who destroy or insult the Dharma they established.** The hymn argues that this is a foolish and ignorant argument, as the Jinas are free from attachment and aversion, and they would not be attached to the Dharma or averse to its destruction.

**The hymn concludes by stating that the Jinas are free from attachment and aversion, and they are not motivated by any desire to protect the Dharma.** They are simply liberated beings who have attained perfect knowledge and vision.

## Explanation of Namostuthunam

**Verse 123 of the Third Light of Yoga Shastra:**

It is impossible to be without delusion. Therefore, these alternatives are born of delusion. Even if there is delusion, there is liberation, or even if there is liberation, there is delusion. To praise such deluded knowers is pure, ignorant, false talk. In this way, by proving the Lord, who is the holder of uninterrupted supreme knowledge and vision, and who is free from karma and the world, to be worthy of praise, the seventh wealth, called the wealth of embodied form, has been explained as consisting of two parts.

Now, the statement "Bhrāntimātramasadvidyā," meaning "the world is only delusion, therefore it is unreal and ignorance," considers even the Jina, who considers all things to be only delusion, as unreal and imaginary in the ultimate sense. Refuting this, it is said, "Jināṇam jāvayāṇam," meaning "Salutations to the Jina, who conquers and makes others conquer the enemies like attachment, aversion, etc." Since attachment, aversion, etc., are experienced by all beings, they are not delusion, unreal, or imaginary. If someone says that the experience of attachment, etc., is delusion, then the experience of happiness, sorrow, etc., of the soul would also be delusion, and the fundamental principle would be destroyed. Therefore, attachment, aversion, etc., are real, and the Jina, who conquers them, is also real, not imaginary. "Jāvayāṇam," meaning "Salutations to the Lord who conquers attachment, etc." The Jina, through his good teachings, etc., also helps other souls to conquer the enemies like attachment, aversion, etc.

Those who consider time to be the cause of every action, and who are the followers of the infinite, do not consider the Lord to be truly liberated from the ocean of the world. They say, "Kāla eva kṛtsnam jagadāvartayati," meaning "Time alone causes the whole world to change in all ways." Refuting this, it is said, "Tināṇam tārayāṇam," meaning "Salutations to the Lord who liberates himself from the world and liberates others from the ocean of the world." The Lord has crossed the ocean of the world by the boat of right faith, knowledge, and conduct. Therefore, he is himself liberated. Because of this, it is not possible for him to return to the world after liberation. If he returns to the world, liberation would be invalid. Therefore, the liberated soul never becomes worldly again. Just as he liberates himself from the world, he also liberates others. In this way, the Lord is also a liberator.

Those who consider knowledge to be indirect, not direct, do not consider the Tirthankara to be enlightened or a giver of enlightenment. They say, "Apratyakshā hi no buddhiḥ pratyakṣo'rthaḥ," meaning "We see the object directly, but we do not see the intellect directly." Therefore, the intellect is indirect to the soul. If it were direct, it should be seen like an object. Refuting this, it is said, "Buddhāṇam bohayāṇam," meaning "Salutations to the Lord who is himself enlightened and who makes others enlightened." In this world, which is asleep in the sleep of ignorance, the knowledge of the soul, non-soul, etc., that the Tirthankara has, is self-realized without the teachings of others. Therefore, he is "Buddha." Knowledge that does not know itself cannot know the object. Just as a lamp cannot illuminate itself and another object, knowledge also illuminates itself and others, i.e., the self and the other. Just as the senses do not see, but still make the object known, knowledge can also make the object known even if it is indirect. Because the senses, which make the object known, are in the form of feelings, and feelings are in the form of sense knowledge, they are direct to the soul. It is said, "Apratyakshōpalabdhasya nārthadṛṣṭiḥ prasiddhayati," meaning "Knowledge that is not directly perceived does not make the object known." In this way, the Buddhahood of the Lord is also proved, as well as the ability to enlighten others. Therefore, the Lord is also an enlightener.

Those who believe that liberation is to become absorbed in the creator Brahma, and who are the followers of Santapana, do not consider the Tirthankara to be truly liberated. They say, "Brahmavad brahma-sangatanam sthitiḥ," meaning "The state of those who merge with Brahma is like the state of Brahma." Refuting their opinion, it is said, "Muttāṇam moyagāṇam," meaning "Salutations to the Lord who is himself liberated from the bondage of karma and who liberates others." The fruit of karma is the wandering in the four states of existence, which is the world.

## A Praiseworthy Description of the State of a Tirthankara After Liberation

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 123**

The Lord is free from that strange bondage of karma, He is accomplished, His work is completely perfected. But to consider the merging of the world-creator into Brahman as perfection does not constitute the perfection of the liberated soul. Because, according to their view, Brahman again creates the world, therefore the work of the soul's perfection remains incomplete. Not only that, but in the creation of the world, making one inferior and another superior, attachment and aversion are also established in Brahman; because how can the state of beings with happiness and sorrow be created without attachment and aversion? The idea that someone merges (unites) with someone else is also illogical; because if that happens, then the existence of that soul is extinguished, it is completely absent. For this reason, the idea of merging with the world-creator is based on ignorance. Therefore, it is proven that the soul of a Tirthankara is itself free from karma, in the same way, it also liberates other souls (by inspiring them) from the bondage of karma. Therefore, the Lord is himself liberated and liberates others. In this way, the Lord, being the conqueror and the one who makes others conquer attachment and aversion, the liberator and the one who makes others liberate, the knower and the one who gives knowledge, the liberated and the one who liberates others, is like himself, a giver of happiness to others. In this way, from these four aspects, the eighth wealth is called 'the one who gives fruit to others like himself'.

Now, those who believe that 'knowledge arises from the yoga of intellect', the Sankhya philosophers do not consider the Lord to be omniscient and all-seeing. They say that 'Buddhyadhwavasitam artha purushashchetayate', meaning that the soul knows only the meaning that is considered by the intellect. This means that the soul itself cannot be a knower and seer; but only through the determination that takes place through the intellect can it know the object. Refuting their belief, it is said - 'Savvannunam Savvadarisinam', meaning that He knows all things, He is omniscient, and He sees all, He is all-seeing. Salutations to such an omniscient and all-seeing Lord.

The nature of the soul is to know and see itself, but due to the veil of karma, it cannot use its own nature. When the veil of karma is removed, the soul, through its own nature of knowledge and vision, knows and sees all things. It is also said that the soul is itself naturally pure like the moon, the knowledge of the soul is like the moonbeams. Just as clouds cover the moon, so too do karmic clouds cover the living being. And it is not the case that knowledge does not arise without the cause of the soul's intellect. In reality, the cause is useful only until the effect is achieved, after that, it is not needed. The karmic veil of the living being, as long as it does not break, as long as the cause of the intellect is needed, but after the complete breaking of the veil, the knowledge of the soul naturally manifests itself; the intellect is of no use to it. For one who does not have the power to swim, a boat etc. is useful; but for one who has manifested the power to swim, a boat etc. is not needed. Similarly, the Lord's innate qualities of knowledge and vision are fully manifested, so He does not need intellect, He can know and see everything without it. Therefore, He is omniscient and all-seeing without the cause of intellect.

Others also say that knowledge tells the specific qualities of all things and vision tells the general qualities. Therefore, since they are not the subject of each other, it is not appropriate to say 'He knows everything and He sees everything'. Perhaps it is reasonable to say that knowledge and vision together can know or see everything. The statement that knowledge cannot know or see independently is also not reasonable, because in reality, there is no difference between the general and the specific. The object that has the general quality also has the specific quality. That is, the object that has the general and specific qualities, its object-like quality is the basis (dharmi) of both, and from this, the living being knows and sees the same quality through the nature of knowledge in the form of a relationship and through the nature of vision in the form of a general form. Because all things become the subject of knowledge and vision.

Here again, there is doubt that knowledge shows the specific relational quality of all things, but it does not show the general quality inherent in them, and vision shows the general quality in all things, but it does not show the specific relational quality inherent in them. Each of these two does not know both qualities; rather, it knows only one quality from both qualities. But those who believe that the knower of one quality is the omniscient knower, and the seer of one quality is the all-seeing seer, this is inappropriate. The answer to this is given as follows: 'It is not true to say this;

## A Praiseworthy Description of the State of a Tirthankara After Liberation

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 129**

Because the general and specific forms of Dharma and its fundamental substance form of Dharma are not different, it is not so. Therefore, the soul, in its secondary form, knows all substances that have the same general existence in a specific way, and in its secondary form, it sees all substances that have a specific characteristic in a general way. In this way, knowledge is the knower of all substances, and vision is the seer of all substances. In this way, the Lord is endowed with the qualities of complete knowledge, vision, and virtue. Therefore, they are omniscient and all-seeing.

Even though the soul is considered to be all-pervasive (extensive), those who believe in the soul's all-pervasiveness after liberation also believe that the soul is all-pervasive. They do not believe that the liberated soul resides in a fixed place. They say, "Mukta: Sarvatra Tishthanti Vyomvatta Apavarjita:" meaning, liberated souls reside pervasively everywhere, like the sky, free from heat.

To refute that view, they say, "Sivamyalamaruyamanantmakkhayamvvaabahampunaraavitti- Siddhigai-namadheyam Thanam Sampattanam." The first word is "Shivam," meaning free from all disturbances. "Ayalam" means immovable, either by its nature or by any use. "Aruyam" means free from disease, because there is no body or mind, which are the causes of disease and pain. "Anantm" means the souls residing there are endowed with the infinite fourfold of knowledge, etc. "Akkhayam" means this eternal place is never destroyed. "Avvaah" means a place free from obstacles and pain due to the absence of karma. "Apunaraavitti" means a place from which there is no return to this world or taking an avatar. "Siddhigai Namadheyam" means the place of those whose entire work is complete, who have achieved their purpose, whose purpose has been fulfilled. That place is called Siddhigat, located in the fourteenth Raj Lok, in the infinite part, on the front part of the Lok. Due to the liberated souls going to that place, the excellent "Thanam" called Siddhigat, meaning the place where pure souls reside, is called "Siddhikshetra" in the practical sense. As it is said, "Ih Bordi Chaittanam Taththa Gantun | Sijjhai," meaning by abandoning the last body of this human world, they become eternally established in the Siddhikshetra.

In the definitive sense, the soul remains in its original form and enjoys bliss in its own form. They remain in the state of self-consciousness. No substance leaves its original form. As mentioned earlier, the adjectives "Shivam," "Achalm," etc., are for liberated souls. However, due to the non-duality of place and the resident, the characteristics of the resident residing there are also attributed to the place. "Sampattanam" means those who attain this place, i.e., those who are completely free from the karmic state of the world, and whose natural self-nature is revealed, attain their pure form. If that soul is considered to be all-pervasive, then, as mentioned above, it cannot attain the Siddhi-place in the practical and definitive sense. Because, by believing in the all-pervasiveness, they remain in the same state everywhere, always, and do not change their place. And their essence is not destroyed by that. They are eternal. This will not happen exclusively for the all-pervasive soul.

Therefore, their worldly state is destroyed, and they remain in their own form. There is no change in them. This confirms that those who are not all-pervasive from the field can attain the place called liberation or Siddhigat, which is the state of abandoning the worldly state. Therefore, what is said, "Kayapramanamatma," meaning the soul is measured by its body, is a true statement. Salutations to such a Lord. Intelligent souls should salute such Lords.

In this sutra, salutations are offered at the beginning and end. Therefore, the salutations should be connected to all the words in the middle. And concluding by stating that only the Arihant Lords are those who conquer fear, "Namo Jinanam | Jiabhayam," meaning salutations to Lord Jinendra and salutations to the Arihant Lords who have conquered all fears. In this way, from "Savvannunam Savvadarisinam" to "Namo Jinanam Jiabhayam," these three sentences are the ninth wealth, which is the attainment of the main qualities of knowledge, vision, etc., which are never destroyed, and the main fruit of liberation. Here, there is a doubt that whether repeated praise with the same adjectives does not lead to the fault of repetition? The answer is...

## The Meaning of "Arihant Cheiyaṇam"

**Yogaśāstra, Third Light, Verse 123** states that "even repeated praise does not constitute a fault of redundancy." It is also said that self-study, meditation, austerity, medicine, advice, praise, charity, and the recitation of existing virtues, even when repeated, are not considered redundant. Similarly, there is no fault of redundancy in this sūtra. 

This sūtra is called **"Namutthuṇam"** - meaning "one who causes prostration" - and also **"Praṇipātadanda-ka Sūtra"** because it leads to the attainment of nine virtues. 

**Śrī Jineśvara Bhagavān** establishes the tīrtha. Before that, during the time of his birth and auspicious events, **Śakra-Indra Mahārāja**, seated in his celestial chariot, praises the Tīrthaṅkara-Prabhu with this Namutthuṇam Sūtra. Therefore, it is also called **"Śakrastava Sūtra"**. 

This sūtra primarily focuses on praising the **Arihant**. However, even if this sūtra is recited in front of a **Tīrthaṅkaradeva**'s image, with the **Arihant**'s essence being attributed to the image, there is no fault. 

After the **Praṇipātadanda-ka Sūtra**, many people recite the following verse to pay homage to the past, future, and present **Jineśvara Bhagavān**:

**"Je a aiyā siddhā, je a bhavisanti nāgae kāle | Sampada a vatṭamāṇā, savye tiviheṇa vandāmi ||1||"**

**Meaning:** I pay homage with my mind, speech, and body to all the **Arihant Bhagavān** who have attained liberation in the past, who will attain liberation in the future, and who are currently dwelling in the world.

After this, one should recite the **"Arihant Cheiyaṇam"** etc. sūtras while standing in front of the **Jinapratimā** and performing the **Jinamudra**. One should understand the **Arihant Cheitya** as the image of the **Arihant**. **Cheitya** means image. **Chitta** means the inner mind. The state of the mind or its function is called **Cheitya**. According to the **"Siddhāhaṁśabda-anuśāsan"**, the word **"Chitta"** takes the **"ṭyaṇ"** suffix, resulting in the word **"Cheitya"** (7.1.59). In the plural, it becomes **"Cheityāni"** (**"Cheiyaṇam"**). The images of **Śrī Arihant Bhagavān** evoke a state of supreme meditative absorption in the mind, hence they are called **"Cheitya"**.

**"Arihant Cheiyaṇam karemi kaussaggam"** means "I perform **kaussagga** to pay homage to those **Arihant Cheitya"**. Now, we will reveal the secret meaning of the word **"kaussagga"**:

As long as I perform **kaussagga** with my body, I remain motionless, and with my speech, I form the **Jinamudra** posture, and with my silent mind, I contemplate the meaning of the sūtra. I meditate on the essence of the sūtra. I abandon all other actions. 

Why is this **kaussagga** performed? We will explain:

**"Vandanavattiaē"** - for the purpose of paying homage, meaning for the sake of the noble inclination of mind, speech, and body. **"Kaussagga** leads to homage." The clear meaning is: I perform **kaussagga** with the intention of paying homage, so that I may receive the benefit of homage.

**"Puṇavattiaē"** - offering incense, perfume, flowers, etc. is called **pūjā** (worship). I perform **kaussagga** for the sake of this **pūjā**.

**"Sakkāravattiaē"** - offering precious items, clothes, ornaments, etc. is called **sattkāra** (respect). I perform **kaussagga** for the sake of such respect.

Here, a doubt arises: A **Muni** is not entitled to perform **dravya-pūjā** (worship with material offerings). And this offering of incense, perfume, clothes, ornaments, etc. is **dravya-pūjā**. How can they perform such **dravya-pūjā**? And **śrāvakas** (lay devotees) perform worship and respect with various material offerings. So, for them, requesting worship and respect through the **kaussagga** recitation is futile. Why should it be done then?

We will answer: It is forbidden for a **sādhu** (holy person) to perform **dravya-pūjā** themselves, but there is no prohibition against having it done by others or approving it. There is also no prohibition against giving advice on it or feeling joy and approval upon witnessing the **pūjā** or **sattkāra** (respect) offered to **Śrī Jineśvara Bhagavān** by others. It is said:

**"Suvyai a yairirsiṇā kāravaṇam pi a aṇuṭṭhiyamimassa | Vayagaganṭhesu taha āgayā desaṇā ceva ||1||"**

**Mahāvratadhārī Vajrasvāmi** himself performed the act of having **dravya-stava** (praise with material offerings) done, and **Pū. Vācakavarya Śrī Umāsvātiji Mahārāja** has given teachings on this subject in his writings. Thus, **sādhu** have the right to have **dravya-stava** performed and to approve it, but they are forbidden from doing it themselves. And for **śrāvakas**, performing such **dravya-pūjā** is appropriate for breaking the bonds of the world. When a **śrāvaka** performs worship and respect themselves, their devotion increases. Therefore, for greater benefit, they request worship and respect through **kaussagga**. From this perspective, it is not futile. Therefore, there is no fault in **sādhu** and **śrāvaka** performing **kaussagga**.

**"Sammāṇavattiaē"** - **kaussagga** is performed for the sake of honor. Praise, hymns, etc.

---------------------------
Twenty-four Tava (people's) Sutra text and its commentary
The third light of Yoga Shastra, verse 123, is called respect. Other Acharyas call mental pleasure respect. Why is this veneration-worship-respect-honor done? This is explained by Bohillabhavattiaye, that is, for the sake of Bodhilabha, the form of Dharma obtained by the Arihant Bhagwan, it is called Kaussagg. Why is this Bodhilabha also? It is said - Niruvassagavattiaye, that is, for the sake of attaining liberation free from birth etc. upsargas, the benefit of Bodhi. Here there is a doubt that the Sadhu and Shravak already have Bodhilabha; then why pray for it? And the fruit of Bodhilabha is liberation; which (liberation) is going to happen from it; then why pray for it? In answer to this, it is said that the Bodhi obtained due to a terrible karma-udaya can also be destroyed. Therefore, it is beneficial to pray for Bodhilabha so that it is not destroyed, and it is also beneficial to pray for liberation in the next birth. And it is appropriate to do Kaussagg for this.
Even if such Kayotsarga is done, if there is no increase in qualities like faith etc. with it, then the success of the desired work cannot be achieved. Therefore, it is said - Saddhae, Mehae, Dhiie, Dharanae, Anupehae, Vaddamaanie Thami Kaussagg, that is, I do Kaussagg with faith, with intelligence, with patience, with concentration, with contemplation, for the increase of all these. The analysis is as follows: Saddhae = with faith. That is, I do Kaussagg with faith, which manifests in the soul due to the destruction and pacification of Mithyatva-Mohaniya karma etc., and which purifies the mind like the Jalakant Mani which purifies water. I do not do it forcibly or for other reasons; but Mehae with skillful intelligence. Meha means - skillful in understanding the best scriptures, abandoning the scriptures of sin, and the intelligence manifested due to the destruction and pacification of Gnanavarania karma - the power to explain to others. I do Kaussagg with that Meha-intelligence; not with dullness or with propriety, not without propriety, and Dhiie with patience. That is, I do Kaussagg with the patience of the mind's samadhi; not by becoming agitated by attachment-aversion etc., and Dharanae, that is, I do it with concentration (remembering the qualities) without forgetting the qualities of Sri Arihant Bhagwan; not with a blank mind, and Anuppehae, that is, I do it while constantly contemplating the qualities of Arihant Bhagwan, not without contemplation. And Vaddamaanie, that is, I do Kaussagg for the increase of this kind. Here, all five of faith etc. are interconnected and beneficial. If there is faith, there is intelligence, if there is intelligence, there is patience, with patience there is concentration, and with concentration there is contemplation; in this way, there is gradual increase, and Thami Kaussagg, that is, I do Kaussagg. Here again the question arises that - in the beginning of the Sutra, Karemi Kaussagg was said, then why was it necessary to say Thami Kaussagg? In answer to this, it is said - your saying is true, but according to the logic of word-science, what is to be done in the near (immediate) future, I do it now. This is how the present tense is used. Satsamipe Sadvad. 5.4.1. According to this Sutra of Siddhahemashabdanushasan, if the present tense is in the near future, then it is considered to be the form of the present tense. According to this logic, Karemi Kaussagg was said in the beginning. By saying this, first there, Bante! Give permission, now I do Kayotsarga; in this way, permission to do Kaussagg was sought. That permission is the form of the verb tense, and the text at the end is, I do Kaussagg now. This is the time of the completion of the action. Since there is some similarity in both, to tell the beginning of it in the present, it is said, I do Kaussagg.
Here the question arises, is the body completely (in all ways) abandoned in Kaussagg? The answer to this is - that is not the case. Earlier, in the Annatha Sutra, it was said that I abandon the activities of the body other than the causes (agaras) like breathing, coughing etc.; to tell this, Annatha Ussasienam etc. Sutra is spoken, and in the same way, Kaussagg is done. Kaussagg is only for eight breaths, and in it, only the Navkar Mantra should be counted, this is not a strict rule; but this is the goal. If the one who is doing Chaitya-Vandan is alone, then at the end of Kaussagg, he says 'Namo Arihantaanam' and completes Kaussagg, and then he praises the Jina Tirthankar Prabhu in front of whom he has done Chaitya-Vandan. If there are many people doing Chaitya-Vandan, then one person completes Kaussagg and praises, the rest of the people do Kaussagg.

The Meaning of the Synonymous Name of the Tirthankaras

In the third light of Yoga Shastra, verse 123 (meditation), remain steadfast and upon completion of the praise, complete the Kausagg by saying "Namo Arihantanam" to all. After that, praise the twenty-four Tirthankaras of the Bharat Kshetra in this present Avasarpini Kal. Since these twenty-four Tirthankaras have occurred in the same region and in the same time period of the present Avasarpini, it is absolutely essential to praise them because they are near and beneficial. From this perspective, to praise them (Chaturvishati-stava), people recite the Logass. The meaning of the Logass Sutra, along with its meaning:

Logass Ujjoagare, Dhammatiththayare Jine | Arihate Kittaissan, Chauchisapi Kevali ||1||

I will praise the twenty-four Sri Arihants (Tirthankaras) who are the illuminators of the world, the founders of the Dharma Tirtha, the conquerors of enemies like raga, dvesha, etc., and the omniscient Kevalis. ||1||

In this verse, the word "Arihant" is the special noun. Understand its meaning according to the meaning stated in the Namotthunan Sutra. I will praise those twenty-four Arihants in "Kittaissan". That is, I will praise them by chanting their names. In the state of a king, etc., they are called Dravya-Arihants, but here we are to praise the Bhava-Arihants, so I will praise those who have attained Kevalgyan. By saying this, the extraordinary knowledge of the Tirthankaras is revealed. To indicate their number, the use of the words "Chauchisampi" - twenty-four and "api" - indicates that I will also praise the other Arihant Tirthankaras besides the twenty-four. How are those Arihants? This is explained - "Logass Ujjoagare", that is, they are the ones who illuminate the world, which is in the form of five Astikayas, Dharma Astikaya, etc., with Kevalgyan. Here there is a doubt, "Does the statement 'omniscient' itself include the concept of being the illuminator of the world?' Then, why was it necessary to say 'illuminators of the world' separately?" In response to this, it is said, "Your statement is true, but the Vijnanadvaitavadis believe that the world is in the form of knowledge. Without knowledge, no other entity is true. Whatever is seen is in the form of illusion." Here, refuting this, it is said, "The illuminator and the illuminated are two different things. That is, the world is the illuminated and knowledge is the illuminator. Thus, there is the one who illuminates and the one who is illuminated." To explain this, it is said, "They are the illuminators of the world." And the devotee who praises the illuminator of the world also benefits from it. That is, because they are the benefactors of the world due to being the illuminators of the world, and because the world is benefited by them, they are worthy of praise. No one praises the one who is not beneficial, so to explain their beneficial nature, it is said, "Dhammatiththayare", that is, the ones who establish the Dharma-predominant Tirtha. The meaning of the word "Dharma" has been explained earlier. Tirtha is that by which one crosses over. Therefore, the Tirtha that is predominantly Dharma is called Dharma Tirtha, Dharmamaya, or Dharma-form Tirtha. Where rivers gather, it is called Dravya Tirtha. To negate such a place and the Dharma-predominant Tirtha established by Shakyas, etc., the word "Dharma" is used here. That is, Dharma itself is the holy Tirtha for crossing over the ocean of Samsara. The founders of such Dharma Tirtha are called Dharma Tirthakaras. Such Arihant Bhagavans, sitting in the Parshada (Dharma-assembly) filled with Devas, humans, and Asuras, explain Dharma with their speech, which is endowed with thirty-five qualities, so that everyone can understand it in their own language. By explaining Dharma in this way, they establish the Dharma Tirtha. This Dharma Tirthakara epithet reveals the extraordinary worship and extraordinary speech of the Arihants. Now, their extraordinary transcendence of suffering and liberation is explained - "Jine", that is, I will praise the one who has conquered the internal enemies like raga, dvesha, etc. Revealing the form of that praise, it is said:

Usabhamjiam Cha Vande Sambhavam Abhinandanam Cha Sumain Cha | Paumppahham Supaasam, Jinam Cha Chandapphahham Yande ||2||

Suvihim Cha Pushpadantam, Siyal-Sijjans-Vasupujjam Cha | Vimalamantan Cha Jinam, Dhamm Santim Cha Bandami ||3||

Kunthu Aram Cha Mallim Vande Munisuvayam Namijinam Cha | Vandami Ritthanemim Paasam Tah Vaddhmanam Cha ||4||

I bow to Sri Rishabhdev and Ajitnath Jin, and I bow to Sambhavnath, Abhinandan Swami, Padma Prabhu, Suparshvanath, and Chandra Prabh Swami. ||3|| I bow to Suvidhinath or Pushpadant, Sheetalnath, Shreyansnath, Vasupujya,

The Meaning of the Symbolic Names of the Twenty-Four Tirthankaras

Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 123: I bow to Vimalnath, Anantnath, Dharmanath, and Shantijin. ||4|| I bow to Kunthunath, Aranath, Mallinath, Munisuvrat Swami, and Namijin. ||5|| I bow to Arishtanemi, Parshvanath, and Vardhaman (Mahavira) Swami. ||5||

The meaning of the above three verses is explained together, and then the same meaning is explained in detail, i.e., in general and specific terms, which can happen to the Tirthankara Bhagwan. In this, 1. Rishabhdev = Ushabh = The general meaning of Rishabh is one who attains the supreme state of liberation; he is Rishabh. The word Rishabh in Prakrit language is formed from the sutra "Udd Ritvadau". ||8.1.131|| The other form of Rishabh is Vrishabh. Its meaning is - "Varshati iti Vrishabhah" i.e., one who showers the world burning with the fire of sorrow with the rain of teachings; he is Vrishabh. "Vrishabhe va va". ||8.1.133|| From the Siddhaheim Sutra, by changing "Vr" to "Us", the form "Ushabh" is formed, and this is its Ushabh form. The specific meaning is - Bhagwan had the mark (sign) of a Vrishabh on his thigh, and his mother Marudevi had first seen a Vrishabh in her dream, therefore Bhagwan was named Vrishabh or Rishabh. 2. Ajitnath - One who cannot be conquered by Parishah etc., therefore he is Ajit, this is the general meaning. The specific meaning is as follows - When Bhagwan was in the womb, his mother was playing Chaupad (dice) with the king. Because the king could not win, the Lord was named Ajit. 2. Sambhavnath - In whom the thirty-four Atishaya qualities are possible in a special way, or by praising whom "Shan" i.e., happiness is obtained. In this, according to the Prakrit rule, "Shan" becomes "Sambhav" from the sutra "Shashosah Sah". ||8.1.260|| This is the general meaning, and the specific meaning is - When Bhagwan came into the womb, it became possible for more food than expected to be produced in the country, therefore he was named Sambhav. 3. Abhinandan Swami - Those who were praised by the Devas, and when the Lord came into the womb, Indra etc. repeatedly praised the mother, therefore he was named Abhinandan. 5. Sumatinath - Sumati means - one who has a beautiful intellect. When Bhagwan was in his mother's womb, the mother had a beautiful intellect that made her decide, therefore he was named Sumati. 6. Padma Prabh - "Padma Prabh" because of the radiance like a lotus due to the quality of "Nishpankta", and when Bhagwan was in the womb, the mother had a dream of sleeping on a lotus bed, which was fulfilled by the Devas, and the radiance of the Lord's body was red like a lotus, therefore he was named Padma Prabh. 7. Suparshvanath - One whose side of the body is beautiful is called Suparshva (Nath). And when he was in the womb, the mother also had a beautiful body, therefore he was named Suparshva. 8. Chandra Prabh - One whose radiance is as calm as the rays of the moon is Chandra Prabh; and at the time of conception, the mother had a dream of drinking moon water, and the radiance of the Lord's body was as bright as the moon, therefore the Lord was named Chandra Prabh. 9. Suvidhinath - Suvidhinath Bhagwan was beautiful and skilled in all matters. When the Lord came into the womb, the mother became skilled in all matters, therefore the Lord was named Suvidhinath, and because his teeth were like flower buds, his other name was Pushpadant. 10. Sheetalnath - One who cools all beings by removing their suffering is Sheetalnath, and when the Lord was in the womb, the father was suffering from jaundice, which could not be cured by any means; but due to the influence of the womb, it was cured by the touch of the mother's hand, therefore he was named Sheetalnath. 11. Shreyansnath - One who has excellent or auspicious arms etc. in the whole world is called Shreyans. And when the Lord was in the womb, the divine bed was used for the first time, and the credit for its use went to the mother, therefore he was named Shreyans. 12. Vasupujya Swami - Dhar, Dhruv, Som, Ah, Anil, Pratyay, and Prabhas are eight Vasu-jati Devas, and because they are worshiped, they are Vasupujya. "Prajnadibhyo'na" - according to this grammar sutra, Vasupujya, and when Bhagwan was in the womb, Indra worshiped the royal family with Hiranya (gold), i.e., Vasu, therefore he was called Vasupujya or Vasupujya because he was the son of the king. 13. Vimalnath - One whose dirt is gone is called Vimal. Or knowledge

##  Praise of Tirthankaras and Siddhas with Respect to Their Fruits and Their Meaning

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 123**

**123.**  He who is pure by virtue of his vision, knowledge, and other qualities is called "Vimala" (pure). When the Lord entered the womb, his influence purified the mother's mind and body, hence the Lord was named "Vimala."

**14.** **Anantnath** - He who conquers infinite karmas or is victorious by virtue of infinite knowledge, vision, and other qualities is called "Anantjit." When the Lord was in the womb, the mother saw an infinite garland of jewels or an infinite, limitless Mahachakra (great wheel) in the sky, which makes one victorious in all three worlds. Therefore, the abbreviated name of Anantjit is Anant. Just as Bhima is called Bhima, similarly Anantjit is called Anant.

**15.** **Dharmanath** - He who sustains beings who are falling into hell is called "Dharma." When the Lord was in the womb, the mother became devoted to Dharma (righteousness) like charity, etc. Therefore, his name was Dharmanath.

**16.** **Shantinath** - He who is the embodiment of peace, who has the yoga of peace, and who is the giver of peace to others is called Shantinath. When the Lord was in the womb, his influence brought peace to the epidemics and other disturbances that had arisen in the country. Therefore, the son was named Shanti.

**17.** **Kunthunath** - The word "Kunthu" means "earth" and "one who resides in it." When the Lord was in the womb, his influence caused the mother to see a heap of jewels, a "Kunthu" of jewels. Therefore, his name was Kunthunath.

**18.** **Aranath** - He who is the best, the most sattvic, and born for the prosperity of the family is called "Ar." The elders named him "Ar." When the Lord was in the womb, his influence caused the mother to see a heap of jewels, an "Ar" (a heap of jewels), in a dream. Therefore, his name was "Ar."

**19.** **Mallinath** - He who conquers the Mallas (warriors) and others. According to the Nirukta (etymology), the meaning of "Malli" is given as "conqueror." When the Lord was in the womb, the mother had a dream of sleeping on a bed of fragrant garlands of flowers of the six seasons, which was completed by the gods. Therefore, his name was "Malli."

**20.** **Munisuvrat Swami** - He who knows or contemplates the three-time state of the world is called a "Muni." According to the grammar rule "Mne-ru-deti cha-asya va Unaadi 612," the word "Muni" is formed by adding the suffix "i" to the root "man" and changing the penultimate "a" to "u." He who has a beautiful vow is called "Suvrat." Thus, the word "Munisuvrat" is formed. When the Lord was in the womb, his influence caused the mother to desire to follow the vow of a Muni. Therefore, his name was "Munisuvrat."

**21.** **Naminath** - He who subdues (conquers) the enemies and the opposing forces is called "Nami." According to the grammar rule "Nami-stu va Unaadi 613," the word "Nami" is formed by changing the penultimate "a" to "i" by an alternative. When the Lord was in the womb, his influence caused the enemy king who had attacked the city to bow down. Therefore, his name was "Nami."

**22.** **Neminath** - He who rotates the Dharmachakra (wheel of righteousness) like the circular "nemi" (rim) of a wheel. When the Lord was in the womb, his influence caused the mother to see a great "nemi" (circular wheel) of precious stones in a dream. Therefore, his name was "Rishtanemi." Just as the word "Apastam" is used for the west, similarly, the negative prefix "a" is used to negate the word "Rishtanemi," making it "Arishtanemi."

**23.** **Parshvanath** - He who sees all emotions is called "Parshva." This is the Nirukta meaning. When the Lord was in the womb, his influence caused the mother to see a snake in the darkness. Knowing that this was the influence of the womb, the mother thought, "He who sees is Parshva." He is also called "Parshva" because he is the lord of the Yaksha who serves him. Just as Bhima is called Bhima, similarly, Parshvanath is also called Parshva.

**24.** **Vardhaman Swami** - He whose knowledge and other qualities increase from the time of his birth. When the Lord was in the womb, his influence caused the prosperity of his family, clan, wealth, and grain to increase. Therefore, the son was named "Vardhaman." Later, seeing his unparalleled prowess, the gods named him "Mahavira."

The twelve verses from "Sri Bhadrabahu Swami" (circa 1093-1104) that explain the meaning of the names are mentioned here. Their meaning is already explained above, so they are not repeated here.

Thus, by praising the twenty-four Tirthankara Lords by name, we now pray for the purification of our minds.

**5.** "May the twenty-four Jina Tirthankaras, who are free from the dirt of karma, old age, and death, be pleased with me, as I have praised them by name."

**Meaning:**  May the Jina Tirthankara Lords, whom I have praised by name, who are free from the dirt of karma, old age, and death, be pleased with me.

##  Hymn to the Agamas (Praise of the Pukkhavāri-davvaḍḍe)

Be pleased with the third light of the Yogaśāstra, verse 123.  I request a special explanation of the words used in this verse - those who have removed the karma-like actions in the form of vihuaraya-mala, raj, and mala.  Karma that binds is called raj, and karma that was bound before is called mala.  Or, bound karma is called raj, and released karma is called mala.  Or, understand that karma that binds in the state of being free from attachment (vītarāga) due to actions like coming and going is called raj, and karma that binds in the state of attachment (sarāga) due to the arising of passions is called mala.  Therefore, those who have destroyed karma in the form of raj and mala, and because of this, their jara-maraṇa (aging and death) etc., which are the suffering caused by the absence of the cause in the form of karma (pahiṇa-jaramana), have been destroyed.  May the twenty-four (cauvīsampi) - that is, the twenty-four Tirthankaras starting with Rishabha, and the word "api" (also) indicates other Jina-varas (Jina-swamis) - that is, the Jinas like Śruta-kevali, who are the most excellent omniscient ones, and the Tīrthayaras (Tirthankaras) who established the pilgrimage sites, be pleased with me.  Although the Tirthankara Bhagavans are free from attachment and aversion, they are not pleased by praise or displeased by criticism.  However, the one who praises will definitely receive the fruit of praise, and the one who criticizes will definitely receive the fruit of criticism.  Just as there is no attachment or aversion in the Cintamani gem, mantras, etc., but still, one receives the fruit of worship in the form of benefit and the fruit of non-worship in the form of harm.  The same should be understood for the Śrī-vītarāga Kevali Bhagavans, etc.  We have said in the Śrī-vītarāga Stotra: "How can fruit be obtained from those who are not pleased?"  It is not appropriate to imagine this.  Do not the inert Cintamani, etc., give fruit?  Then, there is doubt here: if the Tirthankaras are not pleased by praise, then it is pointless to pray for their pleasure.  Why should such pointless talk be uttered?  In response to this, it is said: "This is not the case, because there is no fault in saying this out of devotion."  It is also said: "Even though the Vītarāga Bhagavans, who have weak passions, may not be pleased, praising them is not fruitless, because praising purifies the emotions and also destroys karma.  Therefore, the purpose of the praiser is fulfilled."  And:

> "Kittīya-vandiya-mahiya, je a loggas uttama siddha.  Āruggabohilābhaṁ samāhivaramuttamaṁ dintu." || 6 ||

> "I praise those who have become the most excellent Siddhas in the world, with my mind, speech, and body.  May they grant me health, knowledge, and the highest samadhi through praise, worship, and adoration." || 6 ||

> "Kittīya" means praising by name, "vandiya" means praising properly with all three yogas (mind, speech, and body), "mahiya" means worshipping with flowers, etc.  There is also a variant reading "maīya" in some places.  Its Sanskrit form is "mayaka" - "maya" (by me), "kīrtita" (praised), "vandita" (worshipped), and "stuta" (praised).  Who is that?  It is said: "Je a loggas uttama" - those who are the best in the world of living beings because their karma-mala has been destroyed, and "siddha" - those who have become Siddhas, who have achieved their goal.  May they give me "ārugg-bohilābhaṁ" - health in the form of liberation and the knowledge that is the cause of it, the right faith (samyag-dharma) taught by the Arhats.  Such dharma is practiced only for the attainment of liberation, without any desire for worldly, material happiness.  This is truly considered dharma.  Therefore, it is appropriate to pray for knowledge for liberation and for "samāhivara" - the state of perfect mental health, the samadhi of equanimity of the soul, "uttamaṁ" - the highest samadhi, which is free from all distinctions and differences, "dintu" - may they grant it.  Even though the Vītarāga Prabhus are not pleased, it is appropriate to pray like this out of devotion.  It is also said: "The Śrī-vītarāga, who have weak attachment and aversion, do not give samadhi or the seed of enlightenment.  However, praying like this out of devotion is a form of "asatyāmṛṣā" - a polite way of speaking.  In the world, polite language is spoken in all interactions.  Therefore, this prayer, being a form of devotion, is beneficial."  And:

> "Candesu nimmalayara, āicchesu ahiyaṁ pāyasayara.  Sāgaravaragambhīra, siddha siddhiṁ mama disantu." || 7 ||

> "May the Siddha Bhagavans, who are more pure than the moons, more radiant than the suns, and deeper than the vast ocean, grant me the state of Siddhi." || 7 ||

> "Candesu" - in the moons.  From the sūtra "pañcamyāstṛtīyā" || 8 || 3 || 136 ||, the seventh case is used in the sense of the fifth case in the Prakrit language.  Therefore, in Sanskrit, "Candrebhyaḥ" should be understood in place of "Candesu."  "Nimmalayara" - extremely pure, that is, more pure than many moons because all karma-mala has been destroyed.  There is also a variant reading "Candesu" in some places.  "Āicchesu ahiyaṁ pāyasayara" - more radiant than many suns.

## Praise of the Agamas

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 123**

The one who illuminates more than light itself. The sun illuminates limited areas; while the Arihant, like the sun of pure knowledge, illuminates all substances in the Lok and Alok with his light. It is also said: The radiance of the moon, sun, and planets illuminates a finite area; but the radiance of pure knowledge illuminates the Lok and Alok completely. (A. Ni. 112) And like the deep ocean, unperturbed by the waves, the upsurges, etc., profound like the self-existent ocean of mind, the Siddha, free from karma, having achieved their goal, may the Siddha Bhagavan grant me Siddhi, the supreme state of liberation.

In this way, after praising the twenty-four Jineshwara Bhagavans, to perform the act of bowing down to the Tirthankara images present in the entire world, and to perform Kayotsarga, the recitation from Savvaloe Arihant-Cheiaanam Karemi Kaussaggham to Appaanam Vosirami is done. Its meaning has been explained earlier in Arihant Cheiaanam and Annatha Sutra. Only the meaning of the word Savvaloe was not explained. The meaning of Savvaloe is: the upper world, the lower world, and the intermediate world. Of these three worlds, the lower world contains the abodes of Chamendra, etc., the intermediate world contains islands, mountains, and celestial vehicles, and the upper world contains the Saudharma Devalok, etc., where the eternal Jina images are located. In every temple, the original image is the cause of Samadhi, therefore, first, praise the original deity, and then, since the qualities of all Arihants are the same, embrace all the Tirthankara images of the entire world and perform Kaussaggham. After that, say Namo Arihantaanam, and offer general praise to all the Tirthankaras. Because, if Kaussaggham is performed for someone else and praise is offered to someone else, it is a fault of excessive connection, which is not considered appropriate. Therefore, one should offer general praise to all the Tirthankara Bhagavans.

Now, one should praise the Samyak Shruta, like a lamp, which enables one to clearly understand those Arihants and the meanings conveyed by them. The speaker of that Shruta, the omniscient Arihant Bhagavan, is praised first:

**Pukkhara Varadivede Dhayi Sande A Jambuddiye A. Bharahera Vay-Videhe Dhamma Gare Namasami ||1||**

**Meaning:**

I bow down to the Sri Tirthankaras who established the Shruta Dharma in the Bharat, Airavat, and Mahavideha realms of karma, present in the half-continent of the Pushkaravar, the Dhataki Khand, and the Jambudvipa. ||1||

**Explanation:**

* Bharahera Vay-Videhe - meaning, the Bharat region, the Airavat region, and the Mahavideha region. Here, by combining the words Bharat, Airavat, and Videha, the word Bharatairavatavideha is formed. Dhamma means Shruta Dharma, Aigare means the one who established it in the sutras. The Tirthankara Bhagavan who established the Shruta Dharma in the sutras, I bow down to him. Where are these regions located? It is said:
* Pukkhara Varadivede - It is called Pushkaravar because it is superior to the lotus flower. It is the third island from the Jambudvipa. Inside it, there is the Manushottara mountain in the half-continent, therefore, it is called Pushkaravar-ardha. There are two Bharat, two Airavat, and two Mahavideha regions, making a total of six regions.
* Dhayi Sande - meaning, the section of the Dhataki trees. It is called Dhataki Khand because it is abundant in Dhataki trees. There are two Bharat, two Airavat, and two Mahavideha regions, making a total of six regions.
* Jambuddive - meaning, the Jambudvipa, where Jambudvipa trees are predominant. There is one Bharat, one Airavat, and one Mahavideha region, making a total of three regions.
* All together, there are 6 + 6 + 3 = 15 realms of karma; the rest is the realm of non-karma. Therefore, it is said: Bharatairavatavideha: karmabhumyo'nyatra devakuruttara kurubhyah (Tattvarth Sutra 3-16) meaning, except for Devakuru and Uttarakuru, the Bharat, Airavat, and Mahavideha regions are realms of karma. Here, the Pushkaravar is mentioned first, then the Dhataki region, and then the Jambudvipa, in reverse order. This is done to indicate the vastness and importance of those regions. The word Dhammaigare (establisher of Dharma) refutes the opinion of those who consider the words of the Bhagavan to be non-human and eternal. We have already discussed this argument, so understand it from there.
* Question: How can you say that the Tirthankaras established Dharma? Because, the Arihants become Arihants only after the words of that Shruta knowledge, which proves that Shruta knowledge was eternal, before the Arihant Bhagavan.
* Answer: It is not like that; Shruta knowledge and the Tirthankara Bhagavan are related as cause and effect, like a seed and a sprout. Just as a seed produces a sprout and a sprout produces a seed, similarly, the Bhagavan also attained Tirthankaratva in the third bhava (birth) by practicing Shruta Dharma, and from Tirthankaratva, they became the establishers of Shruta Dharma. There is no objection in saying this. It is not a rule that one becomes an Arihant only after Shruta knowledge, because even in the absence of Shruta Dharma for Marudevi, etc.,

**Salutations to the Shruta-Charitra Dharma**

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 123**

It is heard that Kevala Jnana (Omniscience) was attained. By hearing the words of Kevala Jnana and knowing the meaning of Shruta Dharma, they attain Omniscience. Now, the praise of Shruta Dharma is being said:

**Verse 2:**

I bow to the Shruta Jnana, which destroys the veil of ignorance, is worshipped by the assembly of gods, kings, and Chakravartis, upholds the boundaries, and completely destroys the web of delusion.

**Meaning:**

Tam-Ajnana (ignorance) and Timir-Andhakar (darkness) refer to the darkness of ignorance or the ignorance-obscuring karma that is touched, bound, and hidden. Nikachit Jnana-Avaraniya Karma is Timir-Andhakar. The group of these is called Padal. The one who destroys this is called Viddhansanas, meaning the destroyer of ignorance and binding karma. Suragananarind-Mahiass means worshipped by the gods of the four realms, including Bhavanapati, and by Chakravartis, kings, etc. The gods and Asuras praise the glory of the Agamas. Seemadharas means the Shruta Jnana that upholds the boundaries. The meaning of boundaries is the order (Maryada) of all things, including right and wrong actions, edible and inedible, worthy and unworthy, Dharma and Adharma, which resides only in Shruta Jnana.

**Verse 3:**

Who, knowing the essence of Dharma (Shruta Charitra form), which destroys birth, old age, death, and sorrow, bestows abundant and vast happiness, and is worshipped by the assembly of gods, demons, and kings, will be negligent in the worship of Dharma?

**Meaning:**

Ko - who, a wise person, Dhammas - of Shruta Dharma, Saram - the essence, Uvalabbha - having obtained, knowing, Dharmacharan - in the practice of Dharma, Kare Pamayam - will be negligent? That is, no wise person will be negligent in it. What is the power of this Dharma? It is said: Jai - birth, Jara - old age, Maran - death, Sog - sorrow, Panasanass - completely destroying, meaning it completely destroys birth, old age, death, and mental sorrow. According to the Shruta (scriptures), the practice of Dharma certainly destroys birth and old age. Based on Shruta Jnana, there is the power to destroy all evils in the practice of Dharma. And, Kallan - Kalpa, meaning health and Anati-Lata, that Kallan = Moksha. Pukhhal - Pushkal = abundant, not even a little old age; but, Vishal - vast, Suhavahas - bestowing happiness, meaning the one who practices Dharma according to the Shruta attains the happiness of Apavarga = Moksha. And, Dev-Danav-Narindaganacchiass - that Dharma (Shruta Charitra form) is worshipped by the assembly of gods, demons, and Chakravartis. Therefore, the wise should not be negligent in its worship.

**Verse 4:**

O wise ones! I respectfully bow to the Jina Mat (Dharma), which is always the promoter of the Dharma of restraint, which is worshipped with true feelings by the assembly of gods, Nagas, Suvarna, Kinnaras, and Asuras. This world is established on the basis of that Dharma. And, in which Dharma-Astikaya, etc., all substances and the three realms of humans, gods, and Asuras remain in their respective places. May the eternal Dharma grow with such a restrained, Shruta Jnana-rich, and insightful nature, and may the Charitra Dharma grow continuously with the tradition of victory.

**The Meaning of "Siddha"**

**Commentary on the Third Light of Yoga Shastra, Verse 123:**

The meaning of "Siddha" is "successful" (meaning that Jain Dharma is undoubtedly fruitful) or "Siddha" means "perfect" because Dharma is pervasive in all Naya (principles) or all Naya are included in it, therefore it is perfect. Or, it is perfect because it is pure, having been tested by the three-fold nature of Kshaya (destruction), Chheda (separation), and Taap (suffering). Or, this "Siddha" is a special epithet for Shruta-Agam (scriptural knowledge).

Oh! Look, you all are invited with respect and are told, "Aji" (Oh friend), see for yourself that for so long, I have happily strived with all my might to worship this Jain Dharma, which always increases restraint.  Salutations to that Jain doctrine - Namo Jinam. In this way, I, the striving one, offer salutations with the witness of others. Here, according to the Prakrit language, the seventh case (Saptami Vibhakti) is used in the sense of the fourth case (Chaturthi Vibhakti).

In the yoga of this Shruta-Jnana (scriptural knowledge) form of Dharma, there is always joy in character and increase in restraint, meaning Nandi Saya Sanjame. In the Shri Dasha Vaikalik Sutra, it is said that "Padham Naan, Tao Daya" - first comes knowledge and then compassion (restraint). What kind of restraint-Dharma is that? It is called "Devam-Nag-Suvannakinnaraganassa Bhavacchie" - meaning that the Vaimanik Devas (celestial beings), Dharanendra (king of the earth), Nagadevas (snake gods), Suparna Kumar (bird princes), Kinnaras (mythical beings), Vyantar Devas (intermediate gods), and all other gods, including astrologers, worship that restraint-Dharma with the feeling of a pure heart. Here, the anusvara (nasal sound) on "Dev" should be understood according to the rules of Chanda Shastra (prosody) for the completion of the foot. And, the restrained ones are always worshipped by the Devas and others.

And, the description of Jain Dharma is given as "Logo Jath Paidio Jagaminam" - meaning that in this Jain Dharma, the visible world (Sristi) or the world of knowledge (Jnana Lok) from which the entire universe is seen, this world is established by that knowledge, because all pure knowledge is under the authority of Jina Agam. This world is in the form of the knowable. The implication is that knowledge is revealed from the Agam, which is in the form of Jain Darshan (philosophy), and knowledge is in Jina Agam, and the entire world is also seen or understood through Agam. Therefore, this world is also contained within Jina Agam. Many people consider this visible world (Sristi) to be the world, which is not correct. Therefore, the adjective "Telukkamatchasuram" is given here, meaning that humans, Devas, and by implication, all other beings, that is, the upper world (Urdhva Lok), the lower world (Adho Lok), and the intermediate world (Tiryag Lok) in the form of the base world (Adhar Jagat), and all the beings living in it, including the living and non-living (Ajivadi Bhav) in the form of the object world (Adhey Jagat). In this way, the entire world, in the form of the base and the object, is established in Jain Darshan.

Thus, this Dharma (Shruta Charitra form) in the form of Jain doctrine is a Dharma that is never destroyed, an indestructible Dharma; it increases (Vaddav). How does it increase? "Vijayao Dhammuttaram" - meaning that it conquers the false doctrines and after worshipping Shruta Dharma, there is an increase (Vaddav) in character Dharma. By worshipping Shruta Dharma, there is an increase in the qualities of character, therefore it is said that the seeker of liberation should always increase knowledge. And, one of the reasons for the Tithankar-Nama Karma (karma that leads to becoming a Tithankar) is also mentioned as "Apuvvananagahane" - meaning that by acquiring new and unprecedented knowledge, Tithankar-Nama Karma is bound.

This prayer, being like the seed of liberation, is truly free from fear. Therefore, by making this vow-prayer, one should recite the text from "Suassa Bhagavao Karemi Kaussagg" to "Appaan Vosirami" for the purpose of Kayotsarg (liberation of the body). Its meaning has been explained earlier. Only the meaning of "Suassa Bhagavao" remains. The meaning of Shruta Bhagavan is - from the first Samayik Sutra (Karemi Bhanta Sutra) to the last study of the Dristivad of Bindu Sar, meaning the entire "Shruta" in the form of the twelve-fold scripture (Dwadashangi), is full of glory, influence, and other divine qualities, therefore I perform Kayotsarg to worship the Shruta in the form of Bhagavan. After that, one should recite the third praise of Shruta, passing through the Kayotsarg as before. After that, to offer salutations to the Siddha Bhagavan, who is the fruit of the rituals mentioned in the Shruta, one should recite the following verse:

**Siddhanam Buddhanam, Paragayanam Paramparagayanam. Loaggamu Vagayanam, Namo Saya Savvasiddhanam. ||1||**

**Meaning:**

Salutations to all the Siddhas, who are perfect, enlightened, have crossed over the cycle of birth and death, have become perfect through tradition, and are situated at the forefront of the world. ||1||

**Siddhanam:** Meaning Siddha, that is, those who have achieved their goal, who are perfect in qualities, who are complete, who have no desire for material objects. Cooked rice is not cooked again, in the same way, those who have become Siddhas do not have any desire of any kind. 

...

**Note:** This is a partial translation of the text. The full translation would be very long and detailed.

'Siddhaanam Buddhaanam' Gatha Par Vivechan
Yoga Shastra Triteeya Prakash Shlok 123

I bow to those Siddha-Bhagavants who do not desire any sadhana. This is how the sentence should be connected. Even in that, generally, karma, Siddha, etc., are achieved in many ways. As it is said in the commentary of the scriptures: 1. Karma, 2. Shilpa, 3. Vidya, 4. Mantra, 5. Yoga, 6. Agam, 7. Artha, 8. Yatra, 9. Abhipray, 10. Tap, and 11. Karmakshaya. Thus, they are achieved in these 11 ways. 1. Karma Siddha - If someone, without the teachings of any Acharya, repeatedly performs any karma like lifting weights, farming, trading, etc., and becomes proficient in that karma like Sahya Giri Siddha, then he is called Karma Siddha. 2. Shilpa Siddha - If someone, through the teachings of an Acharya, practices any art like blacksmithing, carpentry, painting, etc., and becomes proficient like Kokas Suthar, then he is called Shilpa Siddha. 3-4. Vidya Siddha, Mantra Siddha - Vidya is called the knowledge that gives results through homa, japa, etc., and Mantra is that which is achieved only by chanting the mantra without japa, etc. Vidya has a presiding deity, while Mantra has a presiding deity. If someone achieves Siddhi by practicing any Vidya, then he is called Vidya Siddha like Arya Khaputacharaya. And if someone achieves Siddhi in any Mantra, then he becomes Mantra Siddha like Stambhaakarsha. 5. Yoga Siddha - If someone is proficient in preparing lepa, anjan, etc., by collecting many herbs, then he is called Yoga Siddha like Arya Samitaacharya. 6. Agam Siddha - Agam means the twelve (twelve) angas and upangas, and the principles, nayanikshepas, etc., discourses and their extraordinary meanings. One who knows them like Gautam Swami is called Agam Siddha. 7. Artha Siddha - Artha means wealth. One who is skilled in acquiring more wealth than others, like Mamman, is called Artha Siddha. 8. Yatra Siddha - One who has completed his journey without any obstacles, like Tundik, on the water route or the land route, is called Yatra Siddha. 9. Abhipray Siddha - One who achieves the task in the way he intended to do it, like Abhaykumar, is called Abhipray Siddha. 10. Tap Siddha - One who has manifested the ability to perform the most excellent tapasya, like Dridha Prahari, is called Tap Siddha. And 11. Karmakshaya Siddha - One who has destroyed the eight karmas, like Jnanavaraniya, from the root, like Marudevi Mata, is called Karmakshaya Siddha. Out of the eleven types of Siddhas mentioned above, one should accept the eleventh, Karmakshaya Siddha, leaving out the ten. By bowing to such Karmakshaya Siddha, the seeker becomes Siddha. Buddhaanam - meaning enlightened. In the world that is asleep in the ignorance-like sleep, those who have become enlightened by knowing the nature of the jiva, etc., without the teachings of others. That is, those who have become enlightened (knowing) and have completely destroyed their karmas, I bow to them. Some philosophers say that Siddhas live in the state of Siddha, renouncing the world and nirvana. They do not stay in the world or nirvana for the welfare of the world, and the world cannot know their nature. They are greater than even the Chintamani Ratna. To refute their opinion, it is said: Paragayanam, I bow to the Siddhas, who have crossed the world, that is, who have ended the purpose of the world. In this regard, the Yadrcchavadis say that just as a poor man suddenly becomes a king, so too a jiva suddenly becomes a Siddha. There is no such thing as order in this. Refuting this, it is said: Parampragayanam, meaning, Siddha who have become by tradition. The meaning is that those who have achieved the full development of the soul through the fourteen gunasthana, through tradition, or those who have achieved the moksha sthana through the yoga of karmakshaya, etc., in some way, I bow to them. Many philosophers consider the place of moksha, which is fixed, to be uncertain. They say that when the world of the soul or the ignorance-like affliction is destroyed, their knowledge remains stable, and since there is a complete absence of affliction, they are never hindered or afflicted in this world. To refute this belief, it is said: Loaggamuvagayanam, in the front part of the world, on the fourteen Raj Lokas, in the end part, there is a Siddha Shila earth called 'Ishat Praagbhara'. Near it, not in another place, all the Siddhas are situated, having destroyed their karmas. It is also said that where there is one soul of a Siddha, there are infinite other Siddha souls who have been liberated from birth and death, having destroyed their karmas, without hindering each other.

Fifteen types of Siddhas

Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 123:  "Those who dwell in eternal bliss, I bow to them." (A. Ni. 975)  Here, there is a doubt: "When all karmas are destroyed, how does the soul move to the end of the universe?"  The answer is that the Siddha souls move due to the power of past actions (karma) and other yogas.  It is said that due to the power of past actions, just as an arrow released from a bow moves forward due to its own momentum, similarly, the soul, freed from karma, moves upward on its own.  Then there is a doubt: "Why does the soul not move further, higher, lower, or diagonally from the Siddha realm?"  The solution is that due to the absence of gravity, i.e., the weight of karma, and no other reason to go down, the liberated soul does not go down.  A clay pot goes down because of the clay, but when the clay is removed, it rises upward.  Similarly, the soul remains down as long as it is bound by karma, but when it is free from karma, it rises upward.  Just as a boat cannot rise in height on the surface of water without the help of water, similarly, the soul does not go above the end of the universe because there is no supporting dharma-astika (righteousness) to help it move.  Instead, it goes up and stops at the end of the universe.  And because there is no yoga or its activity (tendency) as a cause for diagonal movement, it does not move diagonally either.  Therefore, the Siddha's upward movement is only to the end of the universe.

Namo Saya Savvasiddhanam:  I always bow to all the Siddhas, those whose all-achieving (sarvasadhya) has been accomplished, or who have become Siddhas in different forms like Tirtha-Siddha, etc.  These are the 15 types of Siddhas (Supreme Souls): 1. Tirtha-Siddha, 2. Atirtha-Siddha, 3. Tirthankara-Siddha, 4. Atirthankara-Siddha, 5. Swayambuddha-Siddha, 6. Pratyekabuddha-Siddha, 7. Buddhabodhita-Siddha, 8. Strilinga-Siddha, 9. Purushalinga-Siddha, 10. Napumsakalinga-Siddha, 11. Swalinga-Siddha, 12. Anyalinga-Siddha, 13. Grihasthalinga-Siddha, 14. Ekasiddha, and 15. Anekasiddha.

1. Tirtha-Siddha:  One who becomes a Siddha while living in the Tirtha (fourfold assembly of Shramanas (ascetics)) is a Tirtha-Siddha.

2. Atirtha-Siddha:  One who becomes liberated through practice based on knowledge like jati-smarana (recollection of birth), etc., when the Tirtha is broken or there is an interval between Tirthas, when the assembly of ascetics is broken, or who becomes a Siddha before the establishment of the Tirtha, like Marudevi Mata, or who becomes liberated in another Tirtha by practicing the three jewels of knowledge, etc., is called an Atirtha-Siddha.

3. Tirthankara-Siddha:  The Tirthankaras who become Siddhas after attaining the Tirthankara-pad (position) are called Tirthankara-Siddhas.

4. Atirthankara-Siddha:  All those who become Siddhas by being ordinary Kevalis (liberated souls) are Atirthankara-Siddhas.

5. Swayambuddha-Siddha:  Those who become Siddhas by attaining enlightenment (knowledge) on their own are Swayambuddha-Siddhas.

6. Pratyekabuddha-Siddha:  Those who become Siddhas by being Pratyekabuddhas are Pratyekabuddha-Siddhas.  There is a difference between Swayambuddha and Pratyekabuddha in the attainment of enlightenment (knowledge), in the upadhi (condition), in the knowledge of scriptures, and in the attire.  Swayambuddha becomes enlightened without any external cause or instruction, while Pratyekabuddha becomes enlightened due to some external cause, like King Karkandu who became enlightened after seeing the old age of a bull.  Swayambuddha has twelve types of upadhi (dharma-upkaran), while Pratyekabuddha has nine types of upadhi, leaving out three types of clothes.  Swayambuddha does not necessarily retain the knowledge of his past lives in the present life, while Pratyekabuddha does retain that knowledge.  Swayambuddha receives initiation in the presence of the Guru-Maharaja after attaining the ascetic attire, while Pratyekabuddha receives the ascetic attire from the gods as a rule.  There is a difference in this aspect.

7. Buddhabodhita-Siddha:  Those who attain enlightenment and become liberated through the teachings of a knowledgeable Acharya (teacher), etc., are Buddhabodhita-Siddhas.

8. Strilinga-Siddha:  Many women become Siddhas in all these types.  They are called Strilinga-Siddhas.

9. Purushalinga-Siddha:  Those who become liberated in the male form are Purushalinga-Siddhas.

10. Napumsakalinga-Siddha:  Those who attain liberation in the neuter form are Napumsakalinga-Siddhas.

Here, there is a doubt: "Can Tirthankaras also become Siddhas in the female form?"  The answer is "Yes, they can."  It is mentioned in Siddha-Pahuḍ (Siddha-Prabhrit) that the fewest Tirthankaras become Siddhas in the female form.  In the reign of a female Tirthankara, there are countless Atirthankara-Siddhas, and there are countless Atirthankara-Siddhas in the female form in the Tirtha of a female Tirthankara, and there are countless Atirthankara-Siddhas in the Tirtha of a male Tirthankara.  This means that Tirthankaras also become Siddhas in the female form, and in their Tirtha, there are also ordinary Kevalis, Atirthankaras, and Atirthankaras in the female form, etc., who become Siddhas.  However, the number of Atirthankara-Siddhas in the female form is greater, i.e., countless times more.  Tirthankara-Siddhas do not become Siddhas in the neuter form.  And Pratyekabuddha-Siddhas...

## The Attainment of Female Siddhas

**Chapter 3 of the Yoga Shastra, Verse 123**

**Male**

11. The **dravyalinga** forms like **rajoharan** (**ogha**) are attained in their own **linga** (gender). They are called **swalingsiddha**.

12. **Parivrajaka** and others attain **mukti** in other **linga** (gender) (**vesha**). They are called **anyalingsiddha**.

13. **Marudevi** and others attained **mukti** in the **grihasthalinga** (householder gender). They are called **grihasthalingsiddha**.

14. When only one person attains **mukti** at a time, it is called **ekasiddha**.

15. When 108 **siddhas** attain **mukti** at the same time, it is called **anekasiddha**.

In this way, there are 15 different types of attaining **mukti** (**siddha**). It is also said that:

- From one to thirty-two **siddhas** attaining **mukti** together takes eight **utkrista** (excellent) times.
- From thirty-three to forty-eight **siddhas** attaining **mukti** together takes seven **utkrista** times.
- From forty-nine to sixty **siddhas** attaining **mukti** together takes six **utkrista** times.
- From sixty-one to seventy-two **siddhas** attaining **mukti** together takes five **utkrista** times.
- From seventy-three to eighty-four **siddhas** attaining **mukti** together takes four **utkrista** times.
- From eighty-five to ninety-six **siddhas** attaining **mukti** together takes three **utkrista** times.
- From ninety-seven to one hundred and two **siddhas** attaining **mukti** together takes two **utkrista** times.
- From one hundred and three to one hundred and eight **siddhas** attaining **mukti** together takes one **utkrista** time.

After this, there is definitely a difference.

**The 15 types of Siddhas**

The first is **tirthasiddha** and the second is **atirthasiddha**. All other types can be included in these two. Because **tirthankarasiddha** etc. can be included in **tirthasiddha** or **atirthasiddha**. Then what is the need for other types?

The answer is, your argument is valid. However, by mentioning only two types, ordinary people may not know about other types. Therefore, it is necessary to explain other types, but they can be called **uttarabheda** (secondary types).

In this way, after praising all the **siddhas** in general, we praise the present **shasanaadhipati** (ruler of the religion), **Shree Mahaviraswami**, who is a benefactor:

**Verse 2**

**"Jo devaan vi devo, jan deva panjali namansanti. Tan devdevamhiyam, sirasa vade mahaviram."**

**Meaning:**

"He who is the God of Gods, whom even Gods bow down to with folded hands, and who is worshipped by Indras, I bow down to that **Shree Mahaviraswami** with my head."

**Explanation:**

- **Devaan vi devo** means **Shree Mahaviraswami** is the God of all Gods, including **bhavanapati** (householder) and others.
- **Jan deva panjali namansanti** means Gods bow down to him with folded hands in humility.
- **Tan devdevamhiyam** means he is the God of Gods, worshipped by **Indra** and others.
- **Sirasa vade mahaviram** means I bow down to **Shree Mahaviraswami** with my head.

This statement is made to show great respect and honour. Now, how is **Mahavira**? This is explained by adjectives:

- Those who completely destroy their **karmas** or who attain **mukti** with great valour are called **veer** (heroes). And among those **veer**, **Mahavira** is the greatest **veer**. Gods have given him this name. I bow down to him with my head.

In this way, after praising him, we speak a verse that tells the benefits of praise for the sake of **paropkar** (benefitting others) and for the growth of our own **atmabhav** (spiritual feelings).

**Verse 3**

**"Ikko vi namukkaro, jinavaravasahass vadhmaanass. Sansarasaraao, tareid naram va naari va."**

**Meaning:**

"Even a single bow to **Shree Vardhaman Swami**, the best among **jinavars**, saves a man or a woman from the ocean of **samsara** (cycle of birth and death)."

**Explanation:**

- **Ikko vi namukkaro** means even a single bow, not to mention many bows.
- **Jinavaravasahass vadhmaanass** means **Shree Vardhaman Swami**, the best among **jinavars**. Here, **jin** refers to **shrutajin**, **avadhijin**, and others. But **kevali jin** is even greater than them, and among them, **veer** (hero) is the best. Therefore, he is called **jinavar**. Even among ordinary **kevalis**, **tirthankaras** are the best because they have the **namakarma** of **tirthankara**. Therefore, **jinavars** are like **Vrishabha** (bull). All **tirthankaras** like **Rishabhdeva** are as great as **Vrishabha**. Therefore, here, a specific name is mentioned, **vadhmaanass**, which means **Shree Vardhaman Swami**. Even a single bow to him with respect.
- **Sansarasaraao tareid** means the cycle of birth and death of **tiryanch**, **narak**, **manushya**, and **deva** beings is **samsara**. Because there are many types of states in this **samsara**, like **bhavasthiti** (state of existence) and **kayasthiti** (state of body), it is very difficult to cross it, like an ocean. Therefore, **samsara** is like an ocean. This bow saves one from the ocean of **samsara**.
- **Naram va naari va** means it saves a man or a woman.

The meaning of "Siddhaanam Buddhaanam"

Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 123: "Nariin va" means either a man or a woman. In Jainism, to emphasize the importance of men, the word "purusha" (man) is used first. However, the word "nariin va" (or woman) is used to indicate that women can also attain liberation in the same existence, or by destroying their karma, they can cross the ocean of existence and attain liberation.

In the Digambara Jain sect, there is a sub-sect called "Yaapaniya Tantra" (Sangha) which believes in the liberation of women. There are questions raised:

* Is a woman self-existent?
* No, she is not.
* Is she then ineligible for liberation?
* No, she is not.
* Can she not attain right faith?
* No, she can.
* Is she not a human being?
* No, she is.
* Is she born only in an uncivilized form?
* No, she is not.
* Is she only a "Yugalini" with an immeasurable lifespan?
* No, she is not.
* Is she only of a cruel mind?
* No, she is not.
* Is she only of an impure body?
* Absolutely not.
* Is she not a follower of the "Vajra-Rishabhanaraach Sangha"?
* No, she is.

A woman is not devoid of religious inclination, she is not an opponent of the "Apoovarnakaran Gunasthanak" (the state of being free from the cycle of birth and death), meaning she herself is capable of achieving "Apoovarnakaran". A woman possesses the sixth to fourteenth "Gunasthanak" (stages of spiritual progress), but she remains only up to the ninth "Gunasthanak"?
* No, she is not.

Is she incapable of attaining the qualities of knowledge, etc.?
* No, she is not.

Is she only a follower of the path of unrighteousness?
* No, she is not.

Then why is it said that women cannot practice the highest Dharma (liberation)? This means that women can also practice the path of liberation and attain liberation in this very existence. The meaning is that after attaining right faith, a single act of salutation performed with utmost devotion is enough to cross the ocean of existence. Any woman or man who exhibits such a noble resolve will attain the "Kshapak" category (a category of liberated souls) and cross the ocean of existence. In this way, salutation is the cause of the resolve that leads to liberation. However, for the sake of explanation, the cause is considered as the effect, and salutation is said to be the means of crossing the ocean of existence.

Here, the question arises: If liberation is attained through salutation alone, then what is the fruit of observing good conduct? The answer is: It is not appropriate to say that, because the resolve that leads to liberation, which is attained through salutation, is itself the essence of good conduct.

The three verses of the "Siddhaanam Buddhaanam Sutra" are recited regularly because they were composed by Ganadhar. Many devotees recite two more verses after these three. They are as follows:

Prayer and its Discussion by a Devout Seeker

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 123**

I bow to Lord Arishtanemi, the Dharma Chakravarti, who attained his initiation, omniscience, and liberation on the peak of Mount Girnar (Revatakgiri). ||4||

May the twenty-four Jinas, who have attained their goal (liberation) through supreme effort, grant me their blessings. ||5||

**Meaning:**

After saying this, one should recite the following text to indicate that they are engaged in appropriate actions with accumulated merit:

"I offer my obeisance to the Gomukha Yaksha, the A-pratichakras, the Chakreśvari Devi, the Yakshas and Yakshinis, and all those who bring peace to the world, who help the right-seeing beings attain samadhi, for the sake of all the right-seeing and the protectors of the Dharma."

Here, the sixth case ending is used in the sense of the seventh case ending. After this, one should not recite "Vandan-Vattia" etc., but should recite the "Annatha Sutra" because the gods are tireless and it is not appropriate to offer them worship or veneration. By doing this, their feelings are enhanced and they become benefactors to the one who remembers them. The explanation of the "Annatha Sutra" has been given earlier. One should understand it from there. Here, one should only praise the gods who perform "Veyavachcha." Later, sitting down in the same way, one should recite the "Pranipat-Dandak" (Namutthuna) Sutra and then, with the Mukta Shakti Mudra, recite the "Pranidhana-Prarthana Sutra." It is as follows:

**Victory to the Victorious! Victory to the World Teacher! May I have such a state of mind, O Lord! May I be detached from the world, follow the path, and attain the desired fruits! ||1||**

**May I not be involved in any action that is against the people, may I have complete respect for the teachers and elders, and may I be eager to do good to others! May I have the blessing of a good teacher and the strength to follow their instructions! May all this be mine, as long as I have to wander in this world! ||2||**

**Meaning:**

"Victory to the Victorious! Victory to the World Teacher!" - This is how one invites Lord Trilokanath to reside in their mind. "May I have such a state of mind, O Lord!" - This is how one expresses their devotion to the Lord. "May I be detached from the world, follow the path, and attain the desired fruits!" - This is how one seeks liberation from the cycle of birth and death. "May I not be involved in any action that is against the people, may I have complete respect for the teachers and elders, and may I be eager to do good to others!" - This is how one seeks to live a virtuous life. "May I have the blessing of a good teacher and the strength to follow their instructions!" - This is how one seeks guidance and strength on the path to liberation. "May all this be mine, as long as I have to wander in this world!" - This is how one seeks to maintain their devotion and practice throughout their life.

"Victory to the Victorious! Victory to the World Teacher!" - This is how one invites Lord Trilokanath to reside in their mind. "May I have such a state of mind, O Lord!" - This is how one expresses their devotion to the Lord. "May I be detached from the world, follow the path, and attain the desired fruits!" - This is how one seeks liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

"May all this be mine, as long as I have to wander in this world!" - This is how one seeks to maintain their devotion and practice throughout their life.

**Notes:**

1. This is a composition that follows the beginning of the fourth praise. This is why this description is given.
2. There is no discussion on the last two verses and "Veyavachchagaranam." This is also something to consider.

## Description of a Shravak's Daily Routine After Devavandan

**After paying homage to the Gods, the daily routine of a Shravak is described as follows:**

**Violation of Kulacharya:**  
*  Acting against the rules of conduct,
*  Wearing ostentatious attire,
*  Boasting about one's own donations, austerities, journeys, etc.
*  Many Acharyas consider these actions to be against the community.
*  Being happy when a Sadhu-Purusha is in trouble and not trying to save them even when capable. These are also considered against the community.
*  "O Lord! I will abandon such actions!" (Pancha. 2/8-10)

**Serving the Guru:**
*  Properly serving the Guru, which is a form of worship.
*  Although Dharmacharayas are called Gurus, one should also consider parents, art teachers, etc. as Gurus (elders).
*  Yogabindu (verse 110) states: "Parents, art teachers, knowledge gurus, their relatives, elders, and Dharma preachers, all these are considered as Satpurusha Gurus."

**Parothkaranam:**
*  Working for the welfare of other living beings in the mortal world.
*  This is truly a sign of Dharma-Purushartha.

**Acquiring the Qualities:**
*  By acquiring the aforementioned qualities, the seeker gains worldly beauty in life and becomes eligible for the transcendental Dharma.
*  Therefore, it is said: "Suhaguru-Jogo Vishisht Charitravan, Pavitra Shubhaguruon Sadhu-Sadhviyon Evam Dharmacharayon Ka Sangyog-Nishra Mile, Tavvayana-Sevna."
*  "May we get the association of pure, auspicious Gurus, Sadhus, Sadhvis, and Dharmacharayas, who are of exceptional character. May we follow their teachings."
*  Such noble Gurus never give harmful advice. Therefore, their teachings should be served completely, as long as one has to wander in the world.

**Note:**
*  This prayer is specifically for the desire of renunciation (Niaana) and not for the cause (Nidana).
*  This happens before the seventh Gunasthanak, called "Aparamat-Samyam."
*  Beyond the Aparamat Gunasthanak, the being has no desire for the world or liberation. All emotions, good or bad, are equal for them.

**Knowing the Ritual of Chaityavandan:**
*  This way of knowing the excellent ritual of Chaityavandan, which is in the form of a prayer for auspicious results, is up to the two verses of Jay Viyaray.

**Further Duties:**
*  "Tato Gurunam Abhyarne, Pratipatti-Purasaram. Vidhidhit Vishuddhatma, Pratyakhyan-Prakashanam." (Verse 124)
*  **Meaning:** After paying homage to the Gods, if the Guru or Dharmacharaya has come to pay homage to the Gods, or to witness a festival like bathing, or to give a Dharma discourse, or to wander, then go to them, stand three and a half steps away, and respectfully pay homage. Listen to their discourse. Later, reveal the Pratyakhyan done in front of the Gods to the Guru, without arrogance and with a pure mind.
*  The ritual of Pratyakhyan is witnessed by three: 1. Atma-Sakshi (self-witness), 2. Deva-Sakshi (God-witness), and 3. Guru-Sakshi (Guru-witness).

**Guru-Pratipatti (Respect for the Guru):**
*  The previous verse mentions "Pratipatti-Purvak." Therefore, Guru-Pratipatti (respect) is described in two verses.
*  "Abhyuththanam Tada Loke Abhyanam Cha Tadagame. Shirasyanjali-Samsleshah Swayamaasanadhaukanam." (Verse 125)
*  "Asanabhigraho Bhaktya, Vandana Paryupasanam. Tadyane Anugamashcheti, Pratipattiriyam Guroh." (Verse 126)
*  **Meaning:** Upon seeing the Guru Maharaj, immediately leave your seat and stand up respectfully. Go in front of them. If they have arrived, fold your hands on your head and say "Namo Khamasamanam Vachan." Do this yourself, don't ask someone else to do it. Offer them a seat yourself. After the Guru Maharaj sits on their seat, sit on another seat yourself. Later, respectfully perform the twenty-five essential purifications with devotion. If the Gurudev doesn't have to go anywhere and is not busy with any work, serve them with Paryupasana. When they leave, follow them for a short distance. This is how to understand Guru-Pratipatti (the treatment and respect for the Dharmacharaya).

**After Listening to the Dharma Discourse:**
*  "Tatah Pratinivrittah San, Sthanam Gatva Yathochitam. Sudhidharma-Virodhena, Vidhidhit Arthachintanam." (Verse 127)
*  **Meaning:** After returning from the temple, go to your respective place (if you are a king, go to the royal court, if you are a minister, go to the court, if you are a merchant, go to your shop), and think about earning wealth in a way that doesn't harm Dharma.

**Note:**
*  The three-fold Pranidhan is not mentioned here.
*  The ritual of Chaityavandan described here, up to the two verses of Jay Viyaray, is not practiced today.

The evening program, Guru Vandana method
Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verses 128-129 Explanation: - The concern for earning a livelihood mentioned here should be understood as a mere translation; because this is self-evident without inspiration. It should be understood in this way that the concern for wealth of a good householder is not contradictory to Dharma. Dharma's non-contradiction should be understood in this way - if one is a king, then one should do justice without partiality towards anyone, whether he is poor or rich, respected or disrespected, noble or low. And the king's servant should serve the state and the people with sincerity and truthfulness. And the merchant should give up false weights and measures (baant-jag) and engage in business in the form of fifteen karmas, without thinking about wealth. ||127|| ||299|| Then, after midday, one should perform the worship of the Lord and then take food. This is the meaning of half the verse,
There is no rule that food should be taken only at midday, when one is very hungry, that time is called mealtime. If one takes food after performing the worship of the gods after crossing the paccchkhana before midday, there is no fault. Its method is as follows - worship of the Jinas, proper charity, taking care of the family, performing the proper duties of those who are worthy, explaining or giving advice if there is a mistake, and remembering the paccchkhana done by oneself. After eating, one should perform any paccchkhana, including ganthasi, vedhasi, and mutthasi, as much as possible. The soul aspiring to abandon negligence should not remain without renunciation for even a moment. After renunciation, one should have the company of scholars or religious teachers to discuss the meaning and import of the scriptures, and after listening to the secrets of that scripture from the mouth of the guru, one should not stop until one has thoroughly studied it, pondered over it, and contemplated it sufficiently. ||128|| ||300|| Then, at the time of Sandhya, after performing the worship of the gods again, one should perform the six necessary actions, such as Pratikramana, etc., and then perform the excellent study of the scriptures. ||129|| Explanation: - Then, if one eats twice, one should eat two gharis before evening, i.e., in the evening. Later, for the third time, one should perform the worship of the gods in the form of Agra Puja. After that, if there are Sadhus and Muni Rajas, one should have their darshan, Samayik, Chaturvinshati Stava, Vandana, Pratikramana, Kayotsarga, and Pratiakhyana - the six necessary actions. Samayik means to abandon the meditation of Artha-Roudra and to take refuge in Dharma meditation, maintaining equanimity in enemy-friend, grass-gold, etc. Its nature has been described earlier. Later, one should recite the virtues of the twenty-four Tirthankara Bhagavants by name. Then, in Kayotsarga, one should meditate in the mind and after completing Kayotsarga, one should speak that text clearly in clear letters in the manifest form. We have already spoken about this.
After that, one should perform the Vandana, which is the twenty-five necessary-pure, thirty-two faultless salutations, to the venerable Dharmacharaya. In this, the twenty-five necessary should be known as follows (A. Ni. 1216) - In Vandana, there are two prostrations; one Yathajat, twelve Avarta, four from the head, three from the Guti, two entrances and one exit; these twenty-five are necessary to be done. There are two prostrations in this - the desire to salute oneself and the manifest request to the Guru Maharaj - Icchami Khamasamano! Vandiun Javanijjaae Nisihiaae, i.e., 'O Kshamasraman! I want to salute you without sin, according to my ability.' When saying this, bowing the head and the upper part of the body slightly; it is called Avanta or Avantaman. 1. Then, after revolving, when one comes back again, one should also say the mantra Icchami, etc., and then tell the desire, then 2. the second Yathajat, i.e., like birth, birth is counted in two ways - one is taking birth from the mother's womb and the other is taking initiation. Just as in the posture of childbirth, one should keep both hands joined on the head, in the same way, at the time of initiation, one should keep both hands joined with the Rajoharan Mukhavastrika, in the same position as one is born, that posture (position) should be maintained while saluting the Guru Maharaj.

## Guru Vandana: Text, Method and Discussion

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 129**

**12. Thinking:** To perform Vandana with the same thought as keeping a trust.

**13. Maitri (Friendship):** I have friendship with these Acharyas, etc., therefore if I perform Vandana to them, my friendship with them will remain forever. With this thought, I perform Vandana.

**14. Gaurav (Pride):** I am skilled in the method of Guru Vandana, etc., thinking this way, I perform Vandana with pride, giving it a beautiful form to tell others about it.

**15. Karan (Reason):** To perform Vandana with the desire to obtain clothes, vessels, etc., without any reason like knowledge, etc., or to perform Vandana with the desire to become revered in the world due to knowledge, etc., or to perform Vandana with the thought that the Guru Maharaj, who is subdued by the value of Vandana, will not reject my request.

**16. Sten (Thief):** If I perform Vandana to others, I will be considered small; therefore, I perform Vandana secretly like a thief, i.e., like a thief, no one should see, I perform Vandana quickly.

**17. Pratyanik (Busy):** To perform Vandana when the Guru Maharaj is busy with food, etc., it is also said that - Guru Maharaj should not be Vandanaed when they are busy, distracted, or asleep, or when they are eating or have a desire to eat. (A. Ni. 1212)

**18. Rusht (Angry):** To perform Vandana when the Guru Maharaj is angry, or to perform Vandana when you are angry or furious.

**19. Tarjana (Taunt):** Gurudev! You are neither angry by not performing Vandana nor happy by performing Vandana, or you do not know the difference between those who perform Vandana and those who do not. Saying this, to perform Vandana with a taunt, or to perform Vandana with humiliation by taunting with a finger or head, saying that you make me look small by making me perform Vandana in front of many people, but when you are alone, you will know.

**20. Shath (Deceitful):** To show the Guru or ordinary people with deceit that this person is a humble devotee or disciple. To influence them in this way, or to pretend to be sick, etc., and not perform Vandana properly.

**21. Hilita (Humiliated):** Guruji! Vachakvary! What benefit will I get by performing Vandana to you? Saying this, to perform Vandana with humiliation.

**22. Viparikunchit (Contracted):** To perform half Vandana and then talk about other things like stories, etc., in between.

**23. Drisht-Adrisht (Seen-Unseen):** To perform Vandana when not visible in the crowd, or to perform Vandana when it is dark, to sit during that time and perform Vandana when the Guru sees.

**24. Shring (Horn):** To perform Vandana by saying Ahokayam-Kay, etc., and touching the right and left horn parts of the head instead of touching the middle part of the forehead.

**25. Kar (Tax):** To perform Vandana thinking that this Vandana has to be given to Shri Arihant Bhagwan like giving tax to the king.

**26. Mukt (Free):** To perform Vandana without heart, thinking that I have become free from the worldly tax of the king, etc., after taking initiation, but I have not become free from this tax of Vandana.

**27. Ashlista-Nashlista (Touched-Untouched):** While performing Ahokayam Kay, etc., to touch the Rajoharan, forehead, both hands, and palm; to touch the Rajoharan but not the forehead; or to touch the forehead but not the Rajoharan; or to not touch both. The first of the four is free from fault, and the remaining three have this fault.

**28. Nyun (Less):** To not pronounce the letters of the Sutra completely, to not perform the twenty-five necessary things completely while performing Vandana.

**29. Uttar-Chuda (Head-Up):** To say "Matthaena Vandami" in a loud voice after performing Vandana.

**30. Muk (Mute):** To perform Vandana by pronouncing the Sutra in a way that is not understood, like a mute, to perform Vandana by speaking in the mind.

**31. Dhadhdhar (Loud):** To perform Vandana by speaking in a very loud voice.

**32. Chudali Dosha (Fault of the Top):** To perform Vandana by holding the end of the Rajoharan and rotating it like a child rotates a burning piece of wood, or to perform Vandana by extending the hand and saying "I am performing Vandana," or to perform Vandana by rotating the hand to everyone.

In this way, while performing Vandana to the Guru Maharaj, one should abandon these thirty-two faults and perform pure Vandana according to the method.

**Six Desires in Vandana:**

The disciple has six desires in the form of questions from the Guru in Vandana:

1. **Iccha (Desire)**
2. **Anugya (Permission)**
3. **Avyabadh (Obstruction)**
4. **Samyama Yatra (Journey of Restraint)**
5. **Samadhi (Concentration)**
6. **Apradh Ki Kshamayaachana (Apology for Offense)**

These six desires are also mentioned in other places. The disciple asks questions using the text that is prescribed for each of these six desires. (A. Ni. 1232)

**Guru's Answers:**

The Guru Maharaj answers these six questions through the disciple's six-place Guru Vandana in this way:

1. **As you desire, I give permission.**
2. **It is like that.**
3. **It is the same for you too.**
4. **It is like this.**
5. **It is like this.**
6. **I also seek forgiveness from you.**

It is also said that - "I give permission according to your desire, it is like that, it is the same for you too, it is like this, and I also forgive you." In this way, the Guru Maharaj gives six answers. (A. Ni. 1238)

We will explain both of these in the context of the explanation of the Sutra.

**The Guru Vandana Sutra is as follows:**

## Meaning of Guru Vandana Sutra

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 129**

I desire, O Shramans of Forgiveness! To offer you my obeisance with a strong body, free from the five great sins. Please permit me to enter your presence, O Shramans! Oh, what a great joy it is to be forgiven! I am truly fortunate to be in the presence of the pure and virtuous! Is the day auspicious? Is it a day of victory? I seek forgiveness, O Shramans of Forgiveness! I prostrate myself before the divine beings, the protectors of the Dharma, the thirty-two principles of conduct. For any wrong thoughts, words, or actions, for any anger, pride, deceit, or greed, for any transgression of the Dharma, for any offense I may have committed against the protectors of the Dharma, I seek forgiveness, O Shramans of Forgiveness! I condemn myself, I reproach myself, I purify myself.

**Sutra - Explanation:**

Here, with the desire to perform the twelve-fold obeisance, the disciple, after performing a light obeisance in the form of seeking forgiveness, cleanses the ground and sits down. Then, as mentioned earlier, he performs the purification of the mouth with twenty-five syllables and the purification of the body with twenty-five syllables. After that, with utmost humility, having purified himself in mind, speech, and body, he stands outside the three and a half hand-span area of the Guru's seat (which is the ground area equivalent to his own body), and bowing slightly from the waist upwards, like a bow, he takes the Oghā (a type of garland) and the Muhpaṭṭī (a type of cloth) in his hand and says:

"I desire" - meaning, I want to. I do not offer this obeisance under any pressure or coercion, but out of my own free will.

"Khmaasamano" - O Shramans of Forgiveness! Here, the suffix "ā" is added to the feminine form of the root "Ksham" (to forgive), forming the word "Kshamā" (forgiveness). Its meaning is to bear, to endure. And the suffix "an" is added to the root "Shram" (to toil) in the sense of the doer, forming the word "Shraman" (one who toils). Its meaning is one who, being indifferent to worldly matters, practices austerities, or one who strives in the pursuit of knowledge, vision, and character, or in self-realization. In the Prakrit language, it becomes "Khmaasamano" in the form of an address. By accepting forgiveness, one also accepts the qualities of gentleness, honesty, etc. Its meaning is - Shraman endowed with the primary qualities of forgiveness, etc. = Shramans of Forgiveness. Here it is indicated that - being endowed with such qualities of forgiveness, etc., they are truly worthy of obeisance; now what is the desire?

"Vandiun" - meaning, to offer you obeisance. How?

"Javanijjaae Nisihiaae" - Here, "Nisihiaae" is the noun and "Javanijjaae" is the adjective. "Nisihiaae" means in which there is no violence, etc., such "Javanijjaae" = with a strong body. The meaning of this entire sentence is - O Shramans of Forgiveness! endowed with the qualities of forgiveness, etc.! I desire to offer you obeisance with a strong body, free from violence, etc.

Here, one should pause for a moment. At the time of this obeisance, if the Guru is engaged in some other work or if there is some obstacle, then the Guru Maharaj may say that it should be done later, or that it should be left for now. If there is a reason to say so, then he should say it, and if there is no reason to say so, then he should not say it either. This is the opinion of the Churnikara. The commentator's opinion is that at such a time, it is forbidden to offer obeisance with mind, speech, and body, therefore the disciple should offer a brief obeisance. And if the Guru is not engaged in any other work and gives permission to offer obeisance and says - "Chhanden = Abhipraayen = If you wish, offer me obeisance. I have no objection; offer obeisance with joy." Then, to offer obeisance, he should stand three and a half hand-spans away and say - "Anujaanah Me Miuggham" - Please grant me permission to enter your presence. Here, the three and a half hand-spans of land in all four directions, equivalent to his own body, is the Guru Maharaj's "Avgraha" (area of presence), and he cannot enter it without his permission. It is also said - the area equivalent to the Guru's body in all four directions is the Guru's "Avgraha", and it is never permissible to enter it without the Guru's permission. After that, the Guru Maharaj says - "Anujaanami" - meaning, "I grant you permission to enter", then the disciple cleanses the ground, says "Nisihi" and enters the "Avgraha". When going to the Guru Maharaj, the meaning of "Nisihi" is - I renounce all evil deeds. Later, after cleansing the ground, he sits down and places the Oghā on the ground near the Guru Maharaj's feet, and imagining the Guru's feet to be placed in the middle of the Oghā's flowers, he takes the Muhpaṭṭī in his right hand, and with his right hand, he cleanses his forehead from his right ear to his left ear and his right knee three times, and places the Muhpaṭṭī on his left knee. Then, as soon as he utters the sound "A", he touches the Rajoharan (a type of cloth), and utters the sound "Ho", at that time he touches his forehead. Then, while uttering the letter "Ka", he touches the Oghā's flowers with his hand in the same way, and while saying "Ya", he touches the middle of his forehead for the second time. Then, while saying "Ka" again, he touches the Oghā and "Ya"

## Discussion on the Remaining Text of the Guru Vandan Sutra

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 129**

**Touching the forehead while speaking, then touching the Rajoharan with both hands and head while saying "Samphasan", then placing both hands in Anjali mudra in front of the Guru, looking at the Guru, and reciting the Sutra from "Khamanijjo Bhe Kilamo" to "Divaso Vaikkanto".**

The meaning of these words is as follows:

**Aho Kayam = Guru's body - Charanas (feet) are Kayam = my body in the form of hands and head.**

**Samphasan = I touch with my body.** Here, by implication, it means that I bow to your feet, give your command, and this is connected to the previous command. Without permission, there is no right to touch the Guru's body.

**Khamanijjo Bhe = You are worthy of forgiveness, O Bhagavan! Kilamo = My touch caused you pain.**

**Rupa and Appakilantanam = A small amount of pain.**

**Bahusubhen = Very happy form, Bhe = Your Divaso Vaikkanto = Day is complete?** Here, the word "day" should be understood as night, fortnight, four months, and year, according to the context.

Similarly, with both hands joined, the disciple desires to hear the Guru's reply, and the Guru says, "Tahatti = It is so; that is, my day has been fulfilled with happiness." In this way, the disciple inquires about the Guru's well-being.

Now, the disciple inquires about the well-being of the Guru's tapasya (austerity): **"Jatta Bhe"**. While pronouncing "J" with an anudatta tone, touch the Rajoharan with both hands. Then, raise the hands, spread them wide between the Rajoharan and the forehead, and pronounce "tta" with a svarita tone, keeping your gaze fixed on the Guru's face. Then, while touching the forehead with those hands, pronounce "Bhe" with an udatta tone. Here, **Jatta = Journey and Bhe = Your** meaning - O Bhagavan! Is your journey of tapasya, including Kshayika, Kshayopa-shamic, and Aupa-shamic, increasing?

The Guru replies, **"Tubbhe Vattai"**. The meaning is - My journey of tapasya and restraint is increasing, and yours too will increase in that journey.

Now, regarding the object of restraint, the disciple again inquires about well-being: **"Javanijjan Cha Bhe"**. While pronouncing "J" with an anudatta tone, touch the Oghe with both hands. Then, raise both hands, bring them towards the forehead, spread them wide in the middle, and pronounce "V" with a svarita tone. As the hands reach the forehead, pronounce "ni" with an udatta tone. While pronouncing these three letters, even though the question is incomplete, the disciple waits for the answer without looking away. Then, while pronouncing "jjan" with an anudatta tone, touch the Rajoharan with both hands. Then, bring both hands towards the forehead, spread them wide in the middle, and pronounce "cha" with a svarita tone. Then, while touching the forehead with the hands, pronounce "Bhe" with an udatta tone. After that, the disciple waits for the Guru's reply and remains seated in the same position.

**Javanijjan Cha "Bhe"** means - Are your senses and mind, which are subject to control, free from the consumption of Upshamadi (things that cause harm)? The implication is that your body, senses, and mind are free from pain? In this way, the disciple respectfully inquired about the Guru's well-being.

Then, the Guru replies, **"Evam = Yes"**, in the same way, I am free from the senses, etc.

Then, the disciple places both hands and head on the Oghe and says the following to seek forgiveness for his offenses: **"Khamem Khamasamano! Devasian Vaikkaman"**. O Shrama-guna-yukt Shraman! There may have been offenses committed by me in the form of violations of the rituals that are to be performed throughout the day. I seek forgiveness from you for them. Then, the Guru also says, **"Ahamvi Khamem = I also forgive you"**. That is, if there were any offenses committed by you against me throughout the day due to negligence or violation of the law in matters of beneficial teachings, etc., I seek forgiveness for them.

Then, the disciple, after bowing and seeking forgiveness, cleanses the ground behind his feet, comes out of the Avgraha, and recites the Sutra from **"Avassiae"** to **"Jo Me Aiaro Kao"**. This text contains a Sutra that indicates the atonement called Alokchana (self-confession) for confessing one's transgressions. Then, the text **"Tass Khamasamano Padikkamami"**, etc., indicates the method of atonement for Pratikraman. The practitioner should recite this with the understanding that "I will not commit such an offense again and will purify my soul." While coming out of the Avgraha, the practitioner should recite this.

**Avassiae** means - It indicates the observance of Charanasattari and Karanasattari, which are the duties that must be performed, and the transgression that occurs due to their non-observance. **Padikkamami = I repent**. That is, I withdraw from it. After stating this general meaning, the practitioner says specifically - **"Khamasamanaanam Devasiaae Asayanaae"**, that is, towards the Kshamasraman Guru Maharaj.

## The Meaning of the Verses on the Method of Vandan (Salutation)

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 129**

I repent for the offenses committed due to the expectation of gaining knowledge and other benefits throughout the day. How many expectations are there? They are called **Titi-sannaya-raaye**, meaning the thirty-three expectations of the Guru Maharaj. Two, three, or more of these expectations may arise. Since there is a possibility of many expectations arising throughout the day, all of them are mentioned here. We will discuss these expectations further.

In this regard, some special points are mentioned: **Jan kin chi micchaaye**, meaning those done with **mithya-bhava** (falsehood) or due to its cause, with opposite emotions, **man-dukkadaaye, vaya-dukkadaaye, kaya-dukkadaaye**, meaning with a wicked mind or due to hatred, by speaking wicked, uncultured, harsh words, by the wickedness of the body or by sitting very close or by the misconduct of the body while walking. Among these, **kohaaye, maanaaye, maayaaye, lobhaaye**, meaning with anger, pride, delusion, or greed. This means expectations arising from anger, etc., or from any kind of disrespect, etc., during the day.

Similarly, those that occurred during **pakkhi, chaumasi, sanvatsari** (seasonal periods), or those that occurred in previous births, in the past, or in the future, the seeker accepts all of them and states: **Savva-kaaliyaaye**, meaning expectations related to all time. How does the expectation of the future arise? The answer is that by thinking, "Tomorrow I will do this harm or damage to the Guru," in the same way, it is possible to plan the killing, etc., of the Guru in future births or in the past. Thus, with expectations related to all three times, **Savva-miccho-vaya-raaye**, meaning expectations of all false actions, full of pride, deceit, or delusion, and **Savva-dhamma-ikkamannaaye asayannaaye**, meaning expectations of the Guru related to all the eight teachings, the observance of the eight teachings, the transgression of all the rules of conduct, the violation of all the rules of conduct, etc., **me ai-aron kao**, meaning any transgression or offense that I have committed, **tassa khama-samano! Padikkamami**, O **Kshama-shraman** (forgiving one)! I repent for those transgressions in your presence, meaning I resolve not to do them again and withdraw my soul from the offenses. And **nindami, garihami, appaan-vosirami**, meaning I condemn my past sinful soul with a peaceful mind, with the pure resolutions of the present, in your presence, I despise my soul that has done evil deeds, and I renounce the approval of the impure tendencies of my soul.

In this way, by reciting the **Guru-vandan-sutra**, then standing outside the **avgraha** (sacred space) again, the seeker recites the entire text from **icchami khama-samano** to **vosirami** a second time. However, it is important to understand that in the second recitation of the **Guru-vandan**, the seeker recites the entire text except for the word **avvassi-aaye**, without leaving the **avgraha**.

**Now, the meaning of the verse from the Agam that describes the method of Vandan is presented here.**

The foundation of good conduct is humility. It arises from serving the virtuous. And it arises from saluting the Guru according to the proper method. And the method of this twelve-fold Vandan is to be known in this way. ||1||

The seeker who desires to perform **Guru-vandan** should stand in the **yath-ajat-avastha** (the posture of birth), outside the **avgraha**, cleanse the **sandasa** (toilet), sit in the **utkat-ikasana** (a specific posture), write the **mukha-vastrika** (a specific symbol), and cleanse the upper half of the body. ||2||

Then, standing up, press the **chol-patta** (a specific garment) against the waist with the elbow (in the past, the **chol-patta** was not tied with a rope), bow the body, and cover the back in a way that does not disrespect Dharma. ||3||

Holding the **muh-patti** (a specific cloth) with the fingers of the right hand and the **rajo-haran** (a specific cloth) in both hands, the seeker should stand in front of the Guru Maharaj and recite the following words, free from the aforementioned thirty-two faults, for a faultless Vandan. ||4||

Recite from **icchami khama-samano** to **me nisihi-aaye**, then listen to the Guru's response in verse, and request to enter the **avgraha**. ||5||

Say **anu-janah me mi-uggham**, and when the Guru says **anu-janami**, enter the **avgraha**, cleanse the **sandasa**, and sit down. ||6||

After this, cleanse the **rajo-haran** with the ten fingers, touch it to the forehead, and place it on the ground, considering it to be beneficial. Then, first, ||7||

With the left hand, hold the **muh-patti** from one side and cleanse the left ear, the right ear, and the forehead. ||8||

Then, cleanse the bent left knee and place the **muh-patti** on it. And in the middle of the **oghe** (a specific space), visualize (establish) the Guru's feet. ||9||

Then, extend both arms and visualize the Guru's feet on both thighs.

## Discussion on Guru's Expectations

**Chapter 3 of Yoga Shastra, Verse 129**

**10.** Touch the Oghas with both hands and pronounce the sound "A" while doing so.

**11.** Then, turn both hands towards the face and touch the forehead while pronouncing the sound "O".

**12.** After that, touch the Oghas with both hands and pronounce "Ka", then touch the forehead while pronouncing "Ya".

**13.** Again, touch the Oghas while pronouncing "Ka" for the third time and touch the forehead while pronouncing "Ya".

**14.** Then, pronounce "Samphasan" and offer salutations to the Rajoharan with both hands and the head. Raise the head, join both hands and ask "Sukhsata" (well-being).

**15.** Say "Khamanijjo bhe kilamo appa kilantanam bahusu bhen bhe divaso (divaso, pakkho, variso wa) vaikkantto yon" and remain silent for a moment.

**16.** When the Guru Maharaj says "Tatti", then ask about "Sanayamaatra" and "Yapanika" (freedom from the control of senses and mind). At that time, repeat the three cycles as before and incorporate the sounds.

**17.** A question arises: How should this sound yoga be established for a slow-witted disciple to show grace and favor? The answer is: Establish it by pronouncing with skill using the low, high, and medium sounds (voices).

**18.** Establish the low (Anudatta) sound on the Rajoharan, the high (Udatta) sound on the forehead, and the medium (Svarita) sound in between.

**19.** Pronounce the letter "Ja" with the Anudatta sound, "Tta" with the Svarita sound, and "Bhe" with the Udatta sound. Similarly, pronounce the three letters "Ja-Va-Ni" with the Anudatta, etc. sounds.

**20.** For the third time, pronounce "Jj" with the Anudatta sound, "Ch" with the Svarita sound, and "Bhe" with the Udatta sound. Similarly, pronounce with the appropriate sound while touching the Rajoharan in the middle and the forehead.

**21.** The first three cycles have two letters each, and the subsequent three cycles have three letters each.

**22.** Knowing the nature of the cycles, when the other disciple tells you, touch the Rajoharan with both hands and pronounce "Ja" in the middle, "Tta" and "Bhe" on the forehead, and then listen to the Guru's words.

**23.** When the Guru says "Tubbhan pi vattae", then complete the remaining two cycles together and remain silent until the Guru says "Evan".

**24.** After the Guru says "Evan", the disciple should make anjali mudra with both hands on the Rajoharan and say "Khamem, Khamasamano Devasian Vaikkaman" etc. with humility.

**25.** Later, when the Guru says "Ahamvi Khamem Tum" and grants forgiveness, the disciple should say "Avassiae" and leave the Avgraha.

**26.** Then, bend the body and seek forgiveness for all offenses, condemn, criticize, and abandon all faults. Perform the Pratikraman-Prayashchitta in this way.

**27.** Similarly, with humility, perform the three Gupti and seek forgiveness for the first time. Then, perform the second Vandana in the same way. In this, also seek Avgraha, entry, etc., all as before. There are two Vandanas, two Avanta, and two Praveshas.

**28.** In the first Pravesha, there are six cycles, and in the second Pravesha, there are six cycles. Understand that there are twelve cycles from pronouncing the letters "A" etc. separately.

**29.** In the first Pravesha, bow the head twice, and in the second, also bow the head twice. This makes four head bows and one Nishkraman.

**30.** There is one Yathajat and three Gus, making a total of four. Combining these four with the rest, there are a total of twenty-five essentials.

**The thirty-three expectations of the Guru - Tittisannayarae - Vandanasutra - have already been discussed earlier. Here, we explain those thirty-three expectations related to the Guru in detail:**

**1.** If the disciple walks ahead of the Guru without any purpose, it is considered an expectation violation called "Vinayabhang". If it is to show the way or to help an elderly person, blind person, etc., then it is not a fault.

**2.** Walking on the right or left side of the Guru.

**3.** Walking directly behind the Guru. This is considered an expectation violation because it is possible for exhalation, sneezing, phlegm, etc., to fall on the Guru's body.

**4-5-6.** Similarly, standing too close in front, behind, or at the same level is considered three expectation violations.

**7-8-9.** Similarly, sitting too close in front, behind, or at the same level, together, or directly next to the Guru is also considered three expectation violations.

**10.** If the disciple goes to a place with the Guru or Acharya, and goes there first and purifies the body first, it is considered an expectation violation called "Achman".

**11.** If the disciple talks to someone while the Guru is talking, it is considered an expectation violation called "Puralapan".

**12.** If the disciple goes out with the Acharya but returns early and criticizes the journey, it is considered an expectation violation called "Gamana-Gaman Ki Alochana".

## Criticism of the Text: Meaning of Ashatanas

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 129**

13. Bringing food, first approach a junior monk for criticism, then approach the Guru.
14. Similarly, bringing food, first show it to a junior monk, then show it to the Guru.
15. Bringing food, without asking the Guru, give sufficient food as per the junior monk's wish.
16. Bringing alms, first invite a junior monk, then invite the Guru.
17. Bringing alms yourself, give a small portion to the Guru and eat the rest, which is delicious, fragrant, and pleasing to the senses.
18. At night, when the Guru Maharaj says, "Arya! Who is awake? Who is asleep?" Even upon hearing this and waking up, do not respond.
19. Similarly, during the day or at any time, do not respond when called by the Guru Maharaj.
20. When called by the Guru, respond from where you are sitting or sleeping, or get up from your seat or bed, go near, say "Matthaen Vandami," and listen to the Guru's words. If you do not do this, it is considered an Ashatana.
21. When called by the Guru, not saying "Matthaen Vandami," but speaking rudely.
22. Addressing the Guru Maharaj with disrespectful words like "Re, Tu, etc."
23. When the Guru Maharaj commands you to serve the sick, the weak, etc., saying, "Why don't you do it yourself?" When the Guru says, "You are negligent," arrogantly replying, "You are negligent." This is called the Ashatana of "Tajjatavachan."
24. Speaking harshly to the Guru Maharaj or speaking to them in a loud voice.
25. When the Guru Maharaj is giving instructions, interrupting without asking, saying, "This is how it is."
26. When the Guru is narrating a religious story, saying, "You don't remember this," or "You don't understand this."
27. When the Guru is narrating a religious story, not having reverence for them, not being happy in your mind, not approving of the Guru's words, not praising them by saying, "You have spoken very well." This is called the Ashatana of "Upahatamanastva."
28. When the Guru is narrating a religious story, saying, "It's time for alms," or "It's time for sutra reading or eating," etc., and disrupting the gathering. This is called the Ashatana of "Sabhabhedan."
29. When the Guru is giving a lecture, saying, "I will give a lecture," and interrupting the Guru's gathering and lecture. This is called the Ashatana of "Katha-Chhedan."
30. When the Acharya is giving religious instructions, before the gathering rises, the disciple starts explaining to show off their intelligence. This is considered an Ashatana.
31. Sitting on a higher or equal seat than the Guru. This is considered an Ashatana.
32. Touching the Guru's bed or seat, touching them with your hand without their permission. Not seeking forgiveness for these offenses is an Ashatana. It is said, "If you touch the Guru or their clothes or other belongings with your body, or touch them without permission, seek forgiveness by saying, 'Forgive my offense, I will not do it again.'"
33. Standing, sitting, or sleeping on the Guru's bed, Santhara, seat, etc., or using their clothes, utensils, or any other belongings without permission. This is considered an Ashatana.

Thus, these thirty-three Ashatanas are complete. Now, the six verses starting with "Puropakhasanne," etc., are mentioned in the scriptures, which contain the rules of these thirty-three Ashatanas. Their meaning is included in the above discussion, so we will not write it again. Although these Ashatanas are mentioned for monks, they can also apply to the Shravak community, as most of the Shravak's actions and tendencies are based on the monk's actions. It is said that Krishna Vasudeva offered salutations to eighteen thousand monks through the Dwadashavart Vandana. Therefore, these Ashatanas should be understood by the Shravak community as well, as far as possible.

Thus, a disciple who is eager to criticize transgressions while standing in Avagraha, should bow slightly to the Guru and request them in this way: "Ichchakarena Sandisaha (Bhagavan) Devasayam Aloomi," meaning, "If you wish, please give me permission to reveal the transgressions that have occurred during the day in your presence." Here, "Dinasambandhi" and by implication, "Ratrik," "Paakshik," "Chaturmasik," and "Saavatsarik" transgressions are also included in "Aloomi." This means, "according to the rules" or "in all ways."

Alochana Patha ke Artha

Yogashastra Tritiya Prakasha Sloka 129 se aur Loemi apke samne kholkar sunata hoon. Yahan din adi ki alochana mein kaal-maryada is prakar hai - din ke madhya-bhaga se lekar ratri ke madhya-bhaga tak daivika aur ratri ke madhya-bhaga se lekar din ke madhya-bhaga tak raatrika aticharonki alochana ho sakti hai. Arthat din ya ratri ka pratikarama isi tarah ho sakta hai. Aur pakshika, chaturmasika tatha saamvatsarika alochana-pratikarama to pandrah din ka, chaturmas ka aur poore varshabhar ka hota hai.

Isake baad Aloeh alochana karo yon guru ke dwara kathit vachan ka swikarakar shishya icchann aloemi kahe arthat aapki aadnya swikar karta hoon aur alochana-kriya dwara prakata mein karta hoon, is tarah prathamic kathana kahkar shishya saakshaat alochana ke liye yah patha bolata hai.

Jo me devasio aiaaro ko, kaio, vaio, manasio, ussutto, ummaggo, akappao, akaranijjo, dujjhao, duvichintio anayaaro anichchiavvo asavagapauggao, nane taha damsane, charittacharite, sue, samaie, tinnham, guttinham, chaunham kasayanam, panchanham anuvvayanam, tinnham, gunavvayanam, chaunham sikkhayyanam, barasavihassa savagadhammasya jam khadiyam jam viradhiyam tassa miccha mi dukkadam.

Sutra ki Vyakhya - 'Jo me' arthat maine jo koi, 'devasio aiaaro'=divas sambandhi vidhi ka ullanghan karne ke roop mein atichar, 'kao' kiya ho, vah atichar bhi sadhana bheda se aneka prakar ke hote hain. Ato kaha hai 'kaio, vaio, manasio' arthat sharira se, vaani se aur man se maryada viruddha galat pravritta karne se atichar lage hon, 'ussutto'-sutraviruddha vachan bolane se, 'ummaggo' =kshaayopashamik roop bhavamarga ka ullanghan karna unmarga hai athava atma swaroop (kshaayopashamik bhava) ka tyagakar mohaniya adi audayik bhava mein parinaman hona unmarga hai; usse laga hua atichar tatha 'akappao' =kalpa yanee nyayavidhi, aachar tatha charana-karana-roop vyapara (pravritta), isskse jo vipareeta ho, vah akalpya kahalaata hai. Taatparya yah hai ki samyam ka kaarya yathartha swaroop mein nahin hone se lage hue atichar mein 'akaranijjo' =saamaanya roop se nahin karne yogya kaarya ko karne se laga atichar. Upar kahe anusaar utsootra adi shabda kaarya-karana roop se paraspara sambanddhit hai. Utsootra ho to vyakti unmarga mein jaata hai, unmarga par jane se kalpya-akalpya ka viveka nahin rahata. Akalpya se vyakti akaraniya kaarya karta hai. Is prakar kaayika aur vaachika atichar ka vishesh swaroop bataane ke liye utsootra se unmarga tak ke shabdon ka prayog kiya hai. Ab visheshataH maanasik atichar ke liye kahate hain-'dujjhao' arthat ekaagra-chitta hokar dushta dhyana karne se utpanna aarti-raudra-dhyana roopi atichar tatha 'duvichintio' arthat chanchal-chitta se dushta-chintana roop atichar kaha bhi hai ki 'jam thiramadhyavasanam tam dhyanam, jam jalam tayan chittam' arthat man ka sthira adhyavasaay hi dhyana kahalaata hai aur chanchal adhyavasaay chitta kahalaata hai. Yahan par sthira aur chanchal ke bheda kahate hain-'anayaaro' arthat yah shravaka ke liye aacharana karne yogya nahin hai ataH anaacharniya hai aur bhi anaacharniya hai-'anichchiavvo' =icchha karne yogya hi nahin hai. Isliye 'asavagapauggao' arthat jis grihasttha ne samyaktva swikar kiya ho, anuvrata adi vrataniyam angeekar kiye hon, sadaa saadhu ke paas jaata ho, saadhu-shravkaon ki samachaaree ya aacharamaryada-kartavya-kalpana sunta ho, aise shravaka ke liye karne yogya nahin hai. Is prakar kahkar ab atichar bataane ke liye kahate hain-'nane taha damsane, charittacharitte' arthat jnana tatha darshana ke vishaya mein tatha sthool roop se aashrava tyaag yanee savadha yoga se viratavirati (yanee sthool roop se savadha yoga tyaag ke kaarana charitra aur sookshma roop se savadha yoga ke tyaag ke abhava ke kaarana acharitra; is prakar 'charittaacharitra') jaanana. Ye deshaviratiaradhana ke vishaya mein lage hue atichar hue. Ab jnanaadi-vishayak atichar prithak-prithak roop se batalatae hain-'sue' shrutajnana ke vishaya mein (upalakshana se shesh matiajnanaadi chaar jnana ka grahan karna) jnana ke vipareeta-utsootra praroopana karna ya kaal mein swadhyaaya karna aadi jnanaachaar ke aath aacharaon ka palan nahin karna, atichar hai, uske sambandh mein tatha 'samaie' arthat samayika ke vishaya mein, yahan samayika grahan karne se samyaktva-samayika va deshaviratia-samayika jaanana, samyaktva-samayika mein shanka, kanksha adi atichar hai.

The meaning of the word Pratikraman, discussion and benefits of Vandana

Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 129, Sutra-Vyakhya - Jankinch - If any ordinary, natural offense, a slight displeasure in the form of appearance or a special displeasure in the form of another's appearance, or due to any other cause, and by implication, due to my cause, there has been any such offense against you by me or against me by you, it is false; thus, to connect with the last word. In what matters did the offense occur? In Bhatte Bhojan (food), in Pane-Pani (water), in Vinae Vinay Vyavahar (conduct), in standing, etc., in Veyavache (medicine, diet, suitable food, etc.), in Alave (speaking once), in Salave (mutual conversation), in Uchaasane (sitting on a high seat in front of you), in Samasane (sitting on a seat equal to yours), and in Antar Bhasae (when the Gurudev is talking to someone, then speaking in between), in Uvari Bhasae (exaggerating what the Guru has said), Jan Kinch = any natural or in all ways, Majjh = from me, Vinay Parihinam (without respect), Avinay (without respect), Suhumm Va Bayerm Va (subtle or gross), Alp-Prayashchit (purified by minor atonement) or Vishishta-Prayashchit (purified by special atonement), here the second time Va is used for both, to give Mithya Dushkrut (false misconduct). Tubbhe Janah, Aham Na Janami (you know all the things, I don't know). Due to being foolish, I don't even know my own offenses, and those offenses that I may have committed secretly, I don't tell you, I know them. And you don't know the offenses committed by others; and I may not know many offenses; and you know the offenses committed in front of you. Thus, four options of offense are made; understand them all here. Tass - for that offense related to displeasure and disrespect, Miccha Mi Dukkadam (my sin is false), I do Pratikraman (repentance or acceptance of my wrong conduct); (this is a technical term in Jainism), Prayacchami (meaning I forgive); this word should be understood as Adhyaharya (to be accepted). Tass Miccha Mi Dukkadam, the second meaning of this word is like this - Tass (meaning that offense due to displeasure and disrespect), Mi (meaning me), Dukkadam (that sin), Miccha (meaning false), Moksha-Sadhan (means of liberation), Virodh Karne Wala Hai (is opposed to). In this way, know Pratikraman as acceptance of one's faults or apology for the offense.

In the first Vandana, the provision has been made to do Vandana for criticism and apology, after that, know the explanation of Devsian Aaloum and Abbudio Sutra. Otherwise, the opportunity for Pratikraman comes in the necessary way, in this way, the Dwadashavart Vandana Vidhi (twelve-fold Vandana method) is complete. By doing Vandana, there is Moksha (liberation) in the form of Karma Nirjara (destruction of karma). It is also said:

Shri Gautam Swami asked Lord Mahavira Bhagwan, "Bhagavan! What is the benefit to the being by doing Vandana?" The Lord said, "Gautam! The eight karmas, including Gnanavaraneya, which are bound in a thick form, those karmas become loose by doing Vandana. They do not remain stable for a long time, those karmas which have intense rasa (taste) become those with mild rasa, and those karmas which are bound in a large area become those in a small area. Due to this, one does not have to wander in the forest of the endless world for a long time." Then he asked another question, "Bhagvant! What fruit does a being get by doing Guru-Vandana?" The Lord said, "Gautam! By doing Guru-Vandana, the being destroys the karma of the lower caste and binds the karma of the higher caste, and earns the karma called Saubhagya (good fortune), which is the fruit of unhindered obedience, i.e., the one who does not break the Guru's command." (Utt. 30/10) The service and worship of the Guru who is worthy of Vinayopchar (respectful behavior), the command of the Tirthankara, the worship of Shruth Dharma (scriptural dharma), and the nature of action have been explained. (A. Ni. 1229)

Now, the meaning of Pratikraman is said - in it, there is the prefix 'Prati', which means 'opposite' or 'adverse'. And 'Kram' is the root word; its meaning is 'Padaviksep' - to place the foot. With the prefix 'Prati' and the root word 'Kram', the word 'Pratikraman' is formed by adding the suffix 'Anat' in the sense of 'भाव' (state of being). The meaning of Pratikraman is - the soul that has gone from auspicious yoga to inauspicious yoga, returning to auspicious yoga again. It is also said - the soul that has gone from its place to another place due to carelessness, i.e., from its nature to the state of 'विभाव' (opposite state), its return to its own place is called Pratikraman. By taking the opposite meaning of 'Prati',

## General Pratikraman Form

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 129 explains:** When the soul, under the influence of the Audayik Bhav (state of being) from the Kshayopa-shamic Bhav (state of being), again goes against the right path, i.e., returns to the Kshayopa-shamic Bhav, it is also called Pratikraman. This is the same meaning as above. Another meaning could be: "Prati-Prati-Kramanam Pratikramanam," meaning, the movement (Kraman) towards the auspicious Yoga (Shubh Yoga) that leads to Moksha (liberation) is Pratikraman. It is said: Pratikraman is that which frees the Sadhu (saint) from all afflictions like Maya-shalya (affliction of Maya) and leads him towards auspicious Yoga (Shubh Yoga) (makes him behave accordingly). This Pratikraman is related to the sinful actions of the past, present, and future.

**Here, there is a doubt:** Pratikraman is only related to the past. It is said: "I do Pratikraman for the sins committed in the past. I control (stop) the sins of the present and I do Pacchakkhan (repentance) for the sins of the future." Here, only Pratikraman of the past is mentioned, then how is it related to all three times?

**The answer is:** The meaning of the word "Pratikraman" should be understood as "to stop (refrain) from inauspicious Yoga (Ashubh Yoga)." It is also said: "Just as there is Pratikraman of Mithyatva (false belief), similarly, there is Pratikraman of Asanayam (lack of self-control), Kshaya (passions), Pramad (carelessness), and Aprashast (bad) Yoga." The conclusion is that refraining from these five is called Pratikraman. In this, the Pratikraman related to the past is the cessation of inauspicious Yoga through Ninda (condemnation), the Pratikraman related to the present is the cessation of present inauspicious Yoga through Sanvar (control), and the Pratikraman related to the future is the cessation of future inauspicious Yoga through Pacchakkhan (repentance). In this way, there is no objection to the cessation of inauspicious Yoga related to all three times being called Trikal-Pratikraman (Pratikraman of three times).

**Further, this Pratikraman is of five types:** Daivsik (daily), Ratrik (nightly), Paakshik (fortnightly), Chaturmasik (quarterly), and Saavatsarik (annual). The one done at the end of the day is called Daivsik, the one done at the end of the night is called Ratrik, the one done at the end of the fortnight is called Paakshik, the one done at the end of four months is called Chaturmasik, and the one done at the end of the year is called Saavatsarik Pratikraman.

**Again, this Pratikraman is of two types:** Dhruv (fixed) and Adhruv (unfixed). In the Bharat and Airavat Kshetras (regions) and in the Tirth (pilgrimage) of the first and last Tirthankaras (liberated souls), it is Dhruv. Whether there are daily offenses or not, it is necessary to do Pratikraman twice a day, morning and evening. And in the Tirth of the 22 Tirthankaras in between and in the Mahavideha Kshetra, Pratikraman is done only when there is a reason, i.e., when there is a fault, therefore it is Adhruv.

**This is also said:** The Dharma (religion) of the first and last Jineshwara (liberated souls) is with Pratikraman, i.e., in their reign, it is necessary for Sadhus and Sadhvis (saints) to do Pratikraman twice a day. And in the Tirth of the 22 Tirthankaras in between, Pratikraman is done only when there is a reason (when there is a fault).

**The method of Pratikraman has been explained by the ancient Acharyas (teachers):** It should be known according to the Gathas (verses). (A. Ni. 1258) We are only giving their meaning here.

**For the purification of the five types of conduct, Sadhus and Shravaks (lay followers) should also do Pratikraman with the Guru (teacher), and in the absence of the Guru Maharaj, the Shravak should do it alone.**

**1.** First of all, start by doing Devavandan (salutation to the Gods) and then give four Khamasamana (apologies) at the beginning, saying "Bhagwan Hum..." etc., and touch the ground with your forehead and say "Savvas Vi."

**2.** After that, give Miccha Mi Dukkadam (apology for all transgressions).

**3.** Then, say the Samayik Satar, "Yakt Ichchhami Thami Kaussagg..." etc., and keep both hands hanging down, pressing the Chola Patta (sacred cloth) above the waist with your elbows.

**4.** And do Kaussagg (confession) free from the 19 faults like Ghotak (pride). In this, keep the Chola Patta four fingers below the navel and four fingers above the knee (Shravaks should also keep their dhoti in this way).

**5.** In Kaussagg, remember the transgressions committed during the day one by one in your heart and complete the Kaussagg by saying the Namokkar Mantra. Then, say "Logass" openly.

**6.** After that, do Sandasa Pramardjan (purification of the body) and sit down, keeping both hands long so that they don't touch each other, and do the Pratilekhan (reflection) of the mouth with 25 words and the body with 25 words.

**7.** Then, stand up and do the 25 necessary-pure Vandans (salutations) with Vinay (humility) and according to the method, free from the 32 faults.

**8.** After that, bow down to the upper part of the body properly, hold the Muhpatti (mouth cloth) and Rajoharan (purification cloth) in both hands, and confess the transgressions you thought about in Kaussagg in front of the Guru, openly, according to the Gyanadhikram (knowledge and conduct).

**9.** After that, sit down in Jayana (meditation posture) and with effort, become Apramat (attentive) and say "Karemi Bhanta..." etc., and say the Vandittu Sutra (salutation formula). In this, say the remaining Sutra, "Abbudhio Mi Arahanae..." etc.

**Note:** It is not clear here which Devavandan to do.

## The Method of Daily, Nightly and Fortnightly Pratikraman

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 129**

**9.**  Timely, both in terms of substance and feeling, stand up. 

**10.**  Then, after offering two Vandanas, if there are five or more Sadhus in the assembly, say "Abbhuttiyo" and seek forgiveness from three. Afterwards, offer two Vandanas and recite the three Gathas of Ayariya Uvvajhaye, etc.

**11.**  After that, recite the Kaussagg Sutra, "Karemi Bhanta, Ichchhami Thami", etc., and, while dwelling in Kaussagg (meditation), contemplate the two Logass for the purification of transgressions of conduct.

**12.**  Then, after completing the Kaussagg according to the method, recite the Logass in a manifest form for the purification of Samyaktva. For the purification of the same, recite "Savvaloae Arihant - Cheiyaṇam" and perform Kaussagg for the worship of those Chaityas.

**13.**  In that, contemplate one Logass. After crossing that Kaussagg, which purifies Darshan, recite the "Pukkharavar - Diivaddhe" Sutra for the purification of Shruta-Jnana.

**14.**  Then, perform Kaussagg with one Logass, which is twenty-five breaths long, from "Chandesu Nimmalayara" to the end, and complete it according to the method. After that, recite "Siddhaṇam Buddhaṇam Siddastav" as a result of the auspicious ritual.

**15.**  Then, perform Kaussagg for the Shruta-Devatas, who are the cause of Shruta and Smriti. In that, contemplate the Navkar Mantra completely and recite or listen to the praise of the Shruta-Devatas.

**16.**  Similarly, perform Kaussagg for the Kshetra-Devatas, recite or listen to their praise. Afterwards, recite the Navkar Mantra in a manifest form. Then, after performing Sandasa-Pramarjan, sit down.

**17.**  Then, according to the aforementioned method, perform Muhpatti-Pratilekhan, offer two Vandanas, say "Ichchamo Anusatthi" and sit down with support from the knees.

**18.**  Then, recite one praise of "Gurumaharaj Namo'astu". After that, recite three praises with increasing letters and increasing voice. Then, recite "Shakrastavnamotthunan" and praise, and perform Kaussagg for the daily Pratikraman.

**19.**  Thus, the sequence of daily Pratikraman is complete. The method of nightly Pratikraman is also the same. In that, first, perform Pratikraman with "Savvassa Vi" and "Micchami Dukkadam", establishing Kaussagg.

**20.**  Then, according to the method, contemplate one Logass in Kaussagg for the purification of conduct and character. Then, perform the second Kaussagg for the purification of Darshan, also contemplating one Logass in that.

**21.**  In the third Kaussagg, contemplate the transgressions committed during the night, complete the Kaussagg, and, after reciting "Siddhaṇam Buddhaṇam", perform Sandasa-Pramarjan and sit down with knees bent and feet on the ground.

**22.**  As mentioned before, perform Muhpatti-Padhilehan, offer two Vandanas, recite the criticism of the transgressions of the night, and recite the Vandittu Sutra. Then, offer two Vandanas, seek forgiveness with the Abbhuttiyo Sutra, offer two more Vandanas, and recite the three Gathas of Ayariya Uvvajhaye, etc., and perform Kaussagg for the contemplation of Tapas.

**23.**  In that Kaussagg, resolve in your mind that you will perform six months of Tapas so that your journey of restraint is not harmed. If you do not have the strength to perform six months of excellent Tapas,

**24.**  then contemplate one day, two days, three days, and so on, reducing by one day each time, until you reach five months. If you do not have that strength, then, again, reduce by one day each time, until you reach four months, then three months, then two months. If you do not have that strength, then, reducing further, contemplate one month of Tapas.

**25.**  If you do not even have that strength, then, reducing by thirteen days, contemplate thirty-four Bhakt (sixteen fasts) of Tapas. If you do not even have that strength, then, reducing by two Bhakt each time, finally contemplate Chaturthabhakta (one fast) of Tapas. In the absence of that strength, contemplate from Ayambil, etc., to Porsi-Namukkarasi.

**26.**  While contemplating in this way, resolve in your heart the Tapas that you can perform, and complete the Kaussagg. Then, recite the Logass in a manifest form. Afterwards, perform Muhpatti-Padhilehan. Offer two Vandanas and, with a sincere heart, receive Pacchakkhan from the Guru for the Tapas that you have resolved to perform in your mind.

**27.**  Then, say "Ichchamo Anusatthi", sit down, and recite the three praises of Vishal-Lochan-Dal in a soft voice. Afterwards, perform Deva-Vandana with Shakrastav, etc.

**28.**  Fortnightly Pratikraman should be performed on the fourteenth day. In that, perform daily Pratikraman with the Vandittu Sutra as before. After that, perform fortnightly Pratikraman in this sequence, in a Samyag form.

**29.**  First, perform Pakkhi Muhpatti-Padhilehan, offer two Vandanas, and then,

**1.** These two came into practice after the fourth praise of Kayotsarga, hence their mention here.

**2.** At the time of its composition, Sajjhaye, Kayotsarga, and Laghu Shanti or Brihad Shanti had not been introduced.

**3.** Here too, it is not explicitly stated which Deva-Vandana to perform, excellent, medium, or inferior.

## The Defects of Kayotsarga

**Chapter 3 of the Yoga Shastra, Verse 129:**

Criticize the excessive conduct of the Paakshik Kshamana Kar. Then, after offering two Vandanas, seek forgiveness for each Kshamana Kar. After that, offer two Vandanas and recite the Paakshik Sutra. ||29||

After that, recite the Vandittu Sutra. While standing and reciting the words "Abbhudhi Omi Aarahaanaae", complete the Vandittu Sutra and then perform the Kaussagg. After that, perform the Muhpatti Padhilehan, offer two Vandanas, and complete the Samatt-Samaapt Kshamana and four Thobh Vandanas. ||30||

After that, complete the remaining Daivsik Pratikraman according to the previous method. However, instead of the Shrutadevaata, perform the Kaussagg for the Bhuvandevaata, and instead of the Stavan, recite the Ajit Shantistav. Understand this difference. ||31||

In this way, learn the Chaaturmaasik and Saavatsarik Pratikraman methods according to the Paakshik method. Just mention the name of the type of Pratikraman being performed. ||32||

Also, perform the Kaussagg in sequence, with twelve, twenty, and forty Logass with the Navkar Mantra, and perform the Abbhutthi Omi Kshamana for three, five, and Sadhus respectively in the Sambuddha Kshamana, etc. ||33||

We are not discussing the Vandittu Sutra in detail in the Pratikraman due to the fear of the text becoming too lengthy.

**Kayotsarga (Kaussagg) means the abandonment of the body.** Its method is to stand in the Jinmudra posture or, in exceptional cases, sit still with focused concentration due to old age, weakness, etc. Maintain silence with words and focus on auspicious thoughts with the mind. Abandoning all activities of the mind, speech, and body, except for essential bodily functions like breathing, is called Kayotsarga. For every breath, contemplate the Navkar or Logass. Upon completion, pronounce "Namo Arihantaanam".

There are two types of Kayotsarga: one for activity (pravritti) and the other for overcoming obstacles (parabhaav). The Kaussagg performed during the Pratikraman of Iriyaavhi, etc., is for activity, and the one performed for overcoming obstacles is for overcoming. It is said that there are two types of Kayotsarga from the perspective of activity and overcoming. The activities performed for begging fall under activity-Kayotsarga, and overcoming obstacles fall under overcoming.

Activity-Kayotsarga ranges from eight to twenty-five, twenty-seven, three hundred, five hundred, and up to one thousand and eight breaths. The Kayotsarga performed for overcoming obstacles, etc., ranges from one Muhurt to one year, like that of Bhahubali.

Kaussagg is performed in three postures: standing, sitting, and lying down. Each of these has four variations. The first type is Ucchrito Uchchrit, meaning standing in both substance and feeling. This means standing with the body in substance and standing (stable) in Dharma or Shukladhyaan in feeling. The second is Ucchritonuchchrit, meaning Ucchrit for standing in substance and Anuchchrit for feeling due to the presence of Krishnaadi Ashubhleshyaa (results). The third is Anuchchrito Uchchrit, meaning sitting down in substance and being enthusiastic in Dharmadyaan or Shukladhyaan in feeling. The fourth is Anuchchritanuchchrit, meaning sitting down with the body in substance and sitting down in results due to the declining unfavorable results of Krishnaadi Leshya.

Understand these four variations for sitting, standing, and lying down. Kayotsarga should be performed while avoiding defects. The Acharyas have mentioned twenty-one defects of Kayotsarga.

**Defects of Kayotsarga:**

1. **Ghotak Dosha:** Performing Kaussagg while standing on one leg like a horse.
2. **Lata Dosha:** Shaking the body like a vine trembling in a strong wind.
3. **Stambh Dosha:** Performing Kaussagg while leaning on a pillar.
4. **Kudya Dosha:** Performing Kaussagg while leaning on a wall.
5. **Maal Dosha:** Performing Kaussagg with the head resting against the ceiling.
6. **Shabari Dosha:** Performing Kaussagg with both hands on the private area like a tribal woman.
7. **Vadhu Dosha:** Performing Kaussagg with the head bowed like a bride.
8. **Nigad Dosha:** Standing in Kayotsarga with both legs stretched out or bent like someone in shackles.
9. **Lambottar Dosha:** Performing Kaussagg with a loincloth tied from the navel to below the knees.
10. **Stan Dosha:** Covering the breasts or chest area in Kayotsarga to prevent flies or mosquitoes, like a woman covering her breasts with clothes, or like a wet nurse breastfeeding a child.

## Explanation of Pratyakhyana

This text refers to the third light of Yogashastra, verse 129.

**Defects in Kausagg:**

11. **Shakatolka:**  Standing with the heels together or apart, like the rear wheels of a bullock cart, is a defect called Shakatolka.
12. **Sanyati:** Covering the entire body except the head with a cloth during Kausagg, like a Sadhvi, is a defect called Sanyati.
13. **Khalin:** Holding the reins of a horse, like a charwale or a bunch of oge, while standing in Kausagg, is a defect called Khalin. Other Acharyas say that repeatedly shaking the head or moving it up and down during Kausagg, like a horse suffering from the reins, is a defect called Khalin.
14. **Vayas:** Moving the eyes around or looking in different directions during Kausagg, like a crow, is a defect called Vayas.
15. **Kapittha:** Gathering the cholapatte in fear of a jū and holding it in a fist like a kapitth fruit during Kausagg, is a defect called Kapittha. Similarly, holding the fist closed during Kausagg is also considered the same defect.
16. **Shirshothkampit:** Repeatedly shaking the head during Kausagg, like a possessed person, is a defect called Shirshothkampit.
17. **Mook:** Speaking in an unclear and unintelligible way during Kausagg, like a mute, is a defect called Mook.
18. **Anguli:** Counting the number of people by running a finger on the toes during Kausagg, is a defect called Anguli.
19. **Bhru:** Moving the eyebrows up and down during Kausagg, to look in another direction, is a defect called Bhru.
20. **Varuni:** Making a gurgling sound during Kausagg, like the sound of boiling liquor, is a defect called Varuni. Other Acharyas say that swaying around during Kausagg, like a drunkard after drinking alcohol, is a defect called Varuni.
21. **Anupreksha:** Moving the lips during Kausagg, like when studying, is a defect called Anupreksha.

**Summary of Defects in Kausagg:**

1. Ghotak
2. Lata
3. Stambh
4. Kadya
5. Mal
6. Shab
8. Nigad
9. Lambottar
10. Stan
11. Urvi
12. Sanyati
13. Khalin
14. Vayas
15. Kapittha
16. Shirshothkampit
17. Mook
18. Anguli
19. Bhru
20. Varuni
21. Preksha

Many Acharyas mention other defects besides these, such as spitting during Kausagg, touching or scratching body parts, being restless, not following the prescribed methods, neglecting age limits, violating time limits, having an attached and anxious mind, making the mind restless due to greed, engaging in sinful acts, becoming confused in actions, standing on a mat or a stool during Kausagg, etc.

**The fruit of Kausagg is also Nirjara.**

Therefore, it is said: "As the limbs of the body break and hurt during Kausagg, so the eight types of karma groups of the liberated soul break." (A. Ni. 1648)

We have already explained the meaning and interpretation of the sutras of Kausagg.

**Pratyakhyana:**

Pratyakhyana is formed from the three words: "Prati," "A," and "Khyan." "Prati" means "opposite tendency," "A" means "according to the rules," and "Khyan" means "to say." Therefore, Pratyakhyana or Pacchakkhana is the acceptance of favorable rules by the soul, which has been in the Vibhava state since time immemorial, by abandoning unfavorable rules according to its present nature.

There are two types of Pratyakhyana: **Mulaguna** and **Uttaraguna**.

For Sadhus, the five Mahavratas are Mulaguna, and for Shravakas, the five Anuvratas are Mulaguna. For Sadhus, Pindavishuddhi, etc., are Uttaraguna, and for Shravakas, Gunavrata and Shikshavrata are Uttaraguna.

In Mulaguna, there is Pratyakhyana (rule) in the form of complete and universal abandonment of the five sins, namely violence, etc., while in Uttaraguna, for Sadhus, there are rules like Pindavishuddhi, etc., and for Shravakas, there are rules like Digvatadi, etc., in the form of abandonment of opposing tendencies.

A Shravaka who has previously accepted Pratyakhyana (rules) at the appropriate time, knowing the nature of Pratyakhyana, goes to a knowledgeable Guru, who is an expert in Pratyakhyana, with humility and respect, with a focused mind, for Pratyakhyana. He should accept the Pratyakhyana that the Guru recites, contemplating its meaning.

In this regard, the fourfold truth of Pratyakhyana should be considered:

1. **Shuddha Bhang:** Both the giver and the receiver of Pratyakhyana know its meaning.
2. **Shuddhashuddha Bhang:** The Guru who gives Pratyakhyana knows its meaning, but the receiver does not. If the Guru explains the meaning of Pratyakhyana to the receiver in brief while giving it, then this is considered as...

1. The Chaityavandan Bhashya mentions 16 defects.

## Explanation of the Repository of 'Namukkarsahitya' (Naukarasi) Pacchakkhan

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 129** may also be pure. 3. This is the third impure-pure bhang where the guru is unaware of the pratyakhyan vidhi, but the shishya is aware. This bhang is also considered pure if, in the absence of the yog of the knowledgeable guru, the shishya shows respect to the guru and performs pratyakhyan by considering the father, uncle, maternal uncle, elder brother, etc., as witnesses instead of the guru. 4. However, where both the guru and the shishya are unaware of the pratyakhyan vidhi and the shishya is also unwise, then both are impure, making the fourth bhang impure.

The pratyakhyan of the moolguna is usually for life, while the pratyakhyan of the uttaraguna is usually used daily. There are two types of uttaraguna pratyakhyan - sanketa pratyakhyan and addha pratyakhyan. Sanketa pratyakhyan is where the shravak performs pratyakhyan of porasi, etc., and goes out to the field, etc., or stays at home, but does not remain without performing pratyakhyan until the meal is served. From this perspective, he completes his pratyakhyan with a signal of opening the fist, knot, or thumb, etc. In other words, he performs pratyakhyan in the following symbolic form: "Until I open my thumb, fist, or knot, or enter the house, until the drops of sweat dry, until so many breaths are completed, until the bed soaked in water dries, or until the drops stop dripping from it, or until the lamp goes out, I will not eat." It is also said that the pratyakhyan performed with the signal of the thumb, fist, knot, house, sweat, breath, drop, lamp, etc., is called sanketa pratyakhyan by the infinite-knowing, patient men. Addha pacchakkhan is that which has a time limit. It is of ten types. These ten types are: 1. Navkar-sahit naukarasi, 2. Porasi, 3. Purimadd (Purvardha), 4. Ekasan, 5. Ekalthana, 6. Ayambil, 7. Upavas, 8. Divascharim or Bhavcharim, 9. Abhiggrah, and 10. Niviggai or Viggai (Vikritik) - related. These ten are time-based pratyakhyan. (A. Ni. 1611)

Here, there is a doubt that in the pratyakhyan of ekasan, etc., no time limit is clearly known, then why is it called time-based pratyakhyan? The solution is that it is true that there is no need for a time limit with ekasan, but the ancient teachers have also set a time limit for it, and pratyakhyan like ekasan are performed with addha pratyakhyan, therefore it is also called addha pratyakhyan.

Pratyakhyan should be performed with the repository, otherwise it becomes bhang. And the bhang of pratyakhyan or doing it is a very big fault. Therefore, the great sages have said, "There is a great fault in the bhang of the vow-pratyakhyan, while there is virtue in following even a little bit of the pratyakhyan (rule). It is very important to be wise about the profit and loss in religious work. For this, some repositories are mentioned along with the pratyakhyan. (Pancha. 5-12) The meaning of repository is - the limit, concession, (concession or exception) kept with the vow, rule, or pratyakhyan so that the pratyakhyan does not become bhang.

How many and which repositories are there in which pratyakhyan? For this, they explain in order - the auspicious time - proof that can be passed with the pronunciation of the salutation. There are two repositories in the naukarasi pratyakhyan, which we will discuss further as the occasion arises. Here, there is a doubt that in the naukarasi pacchakkhan, the time limit is not clearly known, so why not call it sanketa pratyakhyan? The solution is that this is not true. Here, in the word 'namukkarsahitya', the word 'sahitya' is attached to the word 'namukkar'. The meaning of 'sahitya' is - with. Therefore, the word 'sahitya' is indicative of 'with auspicious time'. Then the word 'sahitya' is an adjective. And the adjective indicates the noun. Therefore, the word 'sahitya' means 'with auspicious time'. Here, the question is raised again that the word 'muhurt' is not there, then how can it be a noun? The answer is that the scriptures have counted it in the time-based pacchakkhan, and we will discuss the porasi, etc., pacchakkhan with the time of prahar, etc., separately later, therefore, this pacchakkhan is considered to be auspicious time-proof before that, therefore, there is auspicious time - and - time in the namukkar-sahit pacchakkhan, one should understand this. Then it is doubted that why its time was not kept for two muhurts instead of one muhurt? The solution is that only two concessions are kept in naukarasi, while six repositories are kept in porasi. Keeping two repositories in namukkarsahitya gives its less fruit, because one muhurt

##  Porisi and 'Purimadd' - The Text of Pacchakkhan and its Explanation

This is a commentary on the text of Pacchakkhan, a Jain practice of abstaining from food and drink, in relation to the third light of Yogashastra, verse 129.  

The rejection of Namukkarasi (with salutations) is to be understood as a single Muhurta (48 minutes) in duration. Even a short Pacchakkhan is accompanied by the Namaskar mantra.  This means that after sunrise, when one Muhurta is complete, the Pacchakkhan is not complete until the Navkar mantra is uttered. However, if one were to complete the Pacchakkhan by uttering the Navkar mantra before two Ghadi (24 minutes), then according to the rules of the time limit for rejection, the time would be incomplete, and the rejection would be broken. This proves that Namukkarasi Pacchakkhan takes place from sunrise to the time of one Muhurta, and includes the utterance of the Navkar mantra.

Now, how does one take the first Muhurta?  According to the Sutra, the rule is the same as for Porisi. The Sutra is as follows:

**Uggaye Sure Namo-kkara - Sahiyam Pacchakkhai, Chauvviham Pi Aharam Asanam, Panam, Khaim, Saim, Annatthanabhogena Sahasagarenam Yosir.**

**Explanation of the Sutra:**

* **Uggaye Sure** - means from sunrise.
* **Namo-kkara - Sahiyam** - means with the Panchaparameshthi-Namaskar-Mahamantra (the great mantra of salutation to the five supreme beings).
* **Pacchakkhai** - means to reject with salutations.
* **Chauvviham Pi Aharam** - means to reject all four types of food.
* **Asanam, Panam, Khaim, Saim** - these are the four types of food: solid food, liquid food, food that is chewed, and food that is sucked.
* **Annatthanabhogena Sahasagarenam** - means that the rejection is not broken by forgetting or by accidentally taking food.
* **Yosir** - means to abandon.

The meaning of this Sutra is that from sunrise, one should reject all four types of food with the Panchaparameshthi-Namaskar-Mahamantra. The disciple who accepts the words of the Guru Maharaj, who is the one who gives the Pacchakkhan, says "Pacchakkhami" (I reject). Similarly, in the place of "Vosri" (abandons), the disciple says "Vosrami" (I abandon) in acceptance of the words of the Guru Maharaj. What is being abandoned? This is explained by the phrase "Chauvviham Pi Aharam" - I abandon all four types of food. The traditional meaning of this in the community is that one should abstain from all four types of food from the night before the rejection. Or, one should complete the fast of abstaining from food at night by crossing its boundary and reaching the point where the sun rises, and then after one Muhurta (48 minutes) has passed, one should complete the Namukkarasi Pacchakkhan by uttering the Namaskar mantra. The explanation of the four types of food has already been given. Here, the reason why the rejection is not broken is explained by the phrase "Annatthanabhogena Sahasagarenam". Here, the third case ending is used in the sense of the fifth case. The two reasons why the rejection is not broken are "Anabhoga" and "Sahasakar". "Anabhoga" means forgetting the Pacchakkhan that one has taken. "Sahasakar" means an action done in haste or hurry, or an action that is done suddenly and unexpectedly, such as accidentally putting something in one's mouth. For example, if while milking a cow, milk accidentally splashes into one's mouth, or if while bathing, one accidentally splashes water into one's mouth, this is Sahasakar. If this happens, the Pacchakkhan is not broken. The meaning of "Vosri" has already been explained.

Now, the text of the Porisi Pacchakkhan is given:

**Uggaye Sure, Porisi Pacchakkhai Chauvviham Pi Aharam Asanam, Panam, Khaim, Saim, Annatthanabhogena Sahasagarenam, Pacchann-kalena Disamohena Sahuvayanena Savvasamahivittiagarenam Yosir.**

**Porisi (Paurushi)** means the time after sunrise when the shadow of a man's body is equal to the length of his body. This time is also called a Prahar (hour). To abstain from all four types of food for this duration is called Porisi or Paurushi Pacchakkhan. What form does this Pacchakkhan take? It is the rejection of all four types of food: solid food, liquid food, food that is chewed, and food that is sucked. This sentence should be connected to the verb "Vosri". There are six Agars (conditions) in this rejection. The first two Agars should be understood in the same way as the Namukkarasi Pacchakkhan. The remaining four Agars are "Pacchannkalena Disamohena Sahuvayanena Savvasamahivittiagarenam". Therefore, by keeping these six Agars in mind, one should reject all four types of food from sunrise to one Prahar.

* **Pacchannkalena** - means that if the sun is hidden by clouds, dust in the sky, or a mountain, and the shadow is not visible, then the time of the rejection is not known, and even if one completes the Pacchakkhan before Porisi arrives, it is not broken. However, if one is eating at the time, and someone tells them the correct time, or if one

## Discussion on Ekāsan-Ekalṭhāṇā

**Yogaśāstra Tṛtīya Prakāśa Śloka 129**

If the time is known, half the food should be consumed and then stopped. The remaining food should be consumed only when the full time has arrived. If one consumes food even after knowing the incomplete time, then their *paccākṣāṇa* is broken. If one mistakenly believes the west direction to be the east direction due to confusion about directions and consumes food during incomplete time, then their *paccākṣāṇa* is not broken due to this *āgāra*. If the confusion is cleared and the correct time is known, then one should stop eating as before. If one continues to eat, then their *paccākṣāṇa* is broken.

**Sāhuvayeṇam-Ugghaḍā Pauraṣī**

If a *sādhu* instructs one to complete the *porasī* before the time arrives, then the *paccākṣāṇa* is not broken due to the aforementioned *āgāra*. This means that if a *sādhu* instructs one to complete the *porasī* before the *porasī-paccākṣāṇa* is fully completed, and at that time, the *bahupadīpuṇṇā porasī* is requested in a loud voice, and the *śrāvaka* thinks that the time to complete the *porasī-paccākṣāṇa* has arrived and consumes food due to this confusion, then their *paccākṣāṇa* is not broken. However, if they know the truth and continue to eat, then they will be guilty of breaking the *paccākṣāṇa*.

**Savyasamāhivattiāgāreṇam**

If after completing the *porasī-paccākṣāṇa*, one experiences intense pain like a sharp pain, and they cannot remain patient until the *paccākṣāṇa* is fully completed, and they experience *ārtadhyāna-raudradhyāna* (disturbed meditation), leading to loss of concentration, then according to the *āgāra* called *savyasamāhivattiāgāreṇam*, one can consume medicine, *pathya* (wholesome food), etc., even before the *paccākṣāṇa* is fully completed, and their *paccākṣāṇa* will not be broken. Similarly, if a doctor advises one to eat before the *porasī* arrives to alleviate a severe illness, then the *paccākṣāṇa* is not broken. If one feels some relief from the illness after eating a little, then after regaining concentration (peace), they should stop eating after knowing the reason.

**Sāḍḍaporisī**

The *paccākṣāṇa* for *sāḍḍaporisī* (one and a half *porasī*) is similar to the *porasī-paccākṣāṇa*, the only difference being that *sāḍḍaporisī* is mentioned instead of *porisī*.

**Now, the *purimaḍḍa-paccākṣāṇa* is discussed:**

**Sūtrapāṭha:**

*Sūre uggaye purimai paccākṣāi, cauvvihampī āhāraṁ asanaṁ, pāṇaṁ, khāimaṁ, sāimaṁ, aṇatthanābhōgeṇam, sahasāgāreṇam, pacchannākāleṇam, disāmōheṇam, sāhuvayeṇam, mahattarāgāreṇam, savyasamāhivattiāgāreṇam yōsirah.*

**Meaning:**

*Purimal* (Purimārddha) means the first half of the day (two *prahara*). In Prakrit, it becomes *purimaḍḍa*. It has seven *āgāra*. Six *āgāra* have already been discussed. The seventh *āgāra* is *mahattarāgāreṇam*, which means that if there is a reason for greater benefit in the form of *karmanirjarā* (destruction of karma) than the *paccākṣāṇa* that one has undertaken, then the *paccākṣāṇa* can be completed before the time arrives, and the *āhāra-paccākṣāṇa* will not be broken. For example, if a *sādhu* is ill or there is a crisis for them or the *saṅgha*, or there is a special task for the *caitya*, temple, or *saṅgha*, which cannot be done by someone else or at another time, then due to these important (greater) reasons, the *paccākṣāṇa* can be completed before the time is up according to the *āgāra* called *mahattarāgāreṇam*. This *āgāra* is not mentioned in *naukārāsī*, *porasī*, etc., because these *paccākṣāṇa* are for a very short time, while this one is for a longer time.

**Now, the *ekāsan* (Ekāsan) *paccākṣāṇa* is described:**

**Sūtrapāṭha:**

*Ekāsaṇaṁ paccākṣāi, cauvbihāmpī, tivihāmpī vā āhāraṁ asanaṁ, pāṇaṁ khāimaṁ sāimaṁ, aṇṇatthanāgābhōgeṇam, sahasāgāreṇam, sāgāriāgāreṇam, āuṇṭaṇapasāreṇam, guru-abbhuṭṭhāṇeṇam, pāriṭṭhāvaṇiāgāreṇam, mahattarāgāreṇam, savyasamāhiyattiāgāreṇam yōsirah.*

**Meaning:**

*Ekāsan* (Ekāsan) means eating at the same time or sitting in the same position with the anus not moving from the seat. This means eating while sitting in the same position. If *ekāsan* is *trivihāra*, then water can be consumed after eating, but if it is *cauvvihāra*, then water can only be consumed during the meal, not afterwards. In this, the meaning of the first two and last two *āgāra* out of the eight mentioned *āgāra* has already been explained. The nature of the four *āgāra* in the middle is explained: *sāgāriāgāreṇam* means that which is with the *āgāra* is called *sāgārik*.

## The Text and Explanation of the Ayambil and Abhattattha (Fasting) Pacchakkhan

**Verse 129 of the Yoga Shastra, Third Light, or as it is also called, the Sagari Grihastha, refers to the Sagarikagar, the abode associated with it.**

This abode signifies that a Sadhu (monk) should not eat in the presence of a Grihastha (householder). This is because doing so brings disrepute (criticism) to the Jinashastra (Jain teachings). Therefore, the Maharshis (great sages) have said that a Sadhu or Sadhvi (nun) who shows compassion to the Shatjivanikaya (all living beings) should not eat or defecate in front of a Grihastha. Similarly, taking food or water from a despised or condemned family also brings disrepute to the Shastra (religious community). Doing so makes it difficult to attain Samyaktva (enlightenment).

**Therefore, the Sadhu's conduct is such that if a Grihastha (brother or sister) comes to the place where the Sadhu is eating and leaves immediately, the Sadhu should remain seated for the meal.** However, if the Grihastha stays for a long time, the Sadhu should not remain seated there. This is because staying in the same position for a long time (while delaying the meal) will hinder other daily routines like Swadhyaya (self-study) and Seva (service). Therefore, if the Sadhu (or Sadhvi) gets up and eats in another place, their Ekasan Pacchakkhan is not broken due to this abode. This rule is made with respect to the Sadhu.

**Now, with respect to the Grihastha, this abode signifies that if a Grihastha is sitting down to eat for Ekasan, and they change their position due to the fear of someone seeing them or casting an evil eye, their Ekasan Pacchakkhan is not broken due to the Sagarikagar.**

**And Aountanapasaarenam = contracting and expanding, meaning contracting or expanding the knees, thighs, feet, etc.** This means that many people cannot sit still in one position for a long time while eating. Due to illness, weakness, or old age, their limbs cannot bear sitting in the same position for long. Such individuals, while performing Ekasan, if they contract or expand their limbs, making them longer or wider, and their posture shifts slightly, their Ekasan Pacchakkhan is not broken due to this abode.

**And Guru-Abhutthanenam = this means that if the Gurudev (spiritual teacher) arrives while eating in Ekasan, standing up to show respect to them does not break the Pacchakkhan due to this abode.** Showing respect to the Guru is done by standing up, which is necessary. Therefore, even while eating, if someone stands up to show respect to elders, their Ekasan is not broken.

**Paritthavanigarenan = discarding the excess food brought in a proper place, giving it away or giving it to a renunciant Sadhu or Sadhvi, is called Paristthapan.** This means that if the Sadhu receives more food than they can eat in their alms, it is not appropriate to keep it for the next day. In such a situation, there is no other option but to discard it. If the Pacchakkhan (Ekasan, etc.) eater consumes this food at that time, their Pacchakkhan is not broken due to the Paristthapanikagar. This is because discarding the said food would lead to many sins like Jivaviradhana (killing of living beings), while according to the Shastra (scripture) and tradition, there are many benefits in consuming the Paristthapan-worthy food by the Pacchakkhan eater (Sadhu or Sadhvi). Therefore, if the Sadhu consumes the excess food with the Guru's permission, their Pacchakkhan is not broken.

**Vosirai = apart from these abodes, I renounce any other posture or food besides the one posture and one food.**

**Now, we will explain the nature of the Ekalthana Pacchakkhan. It has seven abodes. Its text is the same as that of Ekasan. Only instead of Egasanan, Egalthanan should be said, and all the abodes except the Aountan Pasaarenam abode should be mentioned.** This is because the rule in Ekalthana is that the body parts should be kept in the same position until the end of the meal. That is, keeping the limbs in the same position is Ekalthana. One cannot eat without moving the mouth and hands, so there is no prohibition on moving these two. The rule of leaving out the Aountan-Pasaarenam abode is made to differentiate between Ekasan and Ekalthana Pacchakkhan. Otherwise, both these Pacchakkhan are similar.

**This abode is only until standing up, one cannot move back and forth from the place. If the food is nearby, one can take it, but one cannot go to another place to take food.**

## The Text and Explanation of the Ayambil and Abhattah (Fasting) Pacchakkhan

This is a discussion of the third light verse 129 of the Yoga Shastra. Now, the nature of Ayambil Pacchakkhan is explained. It has eight agars (exceptions). The sutra text of Ayambil Pacchakkhan is as follows:

**Ayambilam Pacchakkhai, Annatthanabhogena, Sahasagarena, Levalevenam, Gihatthasansattenam, Ukkhitaviegena, Paritthayanaiagarena, Mahattaragarena, Savyasamahiyattiaagarena Yosirai.**

Ayambil is a technical term in Jainism. Literally, it means "Aayam" (dimension) "Osaman" (moisture) and "Aml" (sour) - the fourth "Khatta Pani" (sour water) or sourness. By implication, it means to adopt the rule of not consuming all kinds of Vigai (condiments), spices, etc., which enhance taste or are oily. In this, one should generally subsist on bland (tasteless), dry food items - rice, wheat, chickpeas, black gram, etc. (once a day), which is called Ayambil or Achaaml Tap in Jainism. The implication is that in Ayambil-Pacchakkhan, one has to eat bland, dry food, devoid of nutritious, delicious, tasty, spicy, heavy, etc. items to conquer taste. The explanation of the first two agars and the last three agars has already been given. The explanation of the three middle agars is as follows:

**Levalevenam:** Lep (application) and Alap (non-application). This means that for someone observing Ayambil, if there is an application of ghee, oil, jaggery (sweet), milk, yogurt, spices, green vegetables, dry fruits, ripe fruits, etc., which are not allowed, on the dry food or utensils that are suitable for Ayambil, then it is the agar of Lep. Or, if there is no application on the food or utensils, but the food is eaten from a utensil that has been cleaned or wiped with hands or cloth that are smeared with oil, etc., which are not allowed, then it is the agar of Alap. This means that the agars of Lep and Alap do not break the Pacchakkhan.

**Gihatthasansattenam:** The householder who gives food, if there is any Vigai or spices, etc., which are not allowed, on the spoon or ladle, etc., with which he gives food to the Sadhu's bowl, or if even a small amount of that unallowed substance from the ladle, etc., is mixed in the food suitable for Ayambil, and the taste of that substance is clearly perceptible in the food suitable for Ayambil, even then, eating such an applied substance does not break the Ayambil Pacchakkhan due to this agar.

**Ukkhitaviegena:** In Ayambil, if there is dry Vigai (jaggery, sweets, etc.) which is not allowed in Ayambil, on the dry roti, chickpeas, rice, etc., which are allowed to be eaten, and even after lifting it properly, its residue or application remains on the roti, rice, etc., then eating it in Ayambil does not break the Pacchakkhan due to this agar. This means that if there is a touch of an unallowed substance on an allowed substance in Ayambil, then Ayambil is not broken. However, one cannot lift halwa, greens, etc., completely; therefore, it (Vigai, etc.) remains attached to the allowed food; this breaks the fast if one eats dry roti, rice, etc.

In this way, apart from these agars (exceptions), I renounce the other four foods that are not allowed to be eaten in Ayambil. The meaning of the remaining terms has already been explained.

Now, the description of the Pacchakkhan of fasting is given. It has five agars. Here, the sutra text of the first Upvas-Pacchakkhan is given:

**Sure Uggae Abmattu Pacchakkhai Chavyihamphi, Tivihamphi Ya Aharam Asanam, Panam, Khaim, Khaim Annatthanabhogena Sahasagarena Paritthavaniagarena, Mahattaragarena Savyasamahiyattiaagarena Yosirah.**

**Sure Uggae:** From sunrise. This means that fasting cannot be observed during the rest of the day after eating food.

**Abmatthatt:** The Pratyakhyan (renunciation) in which there is no purpose of eating food is called Abhattharth (fasting). Its agars are the same as before. In this, the Paritthavaniagar is special. If one has observed a Tivihar fast, then due to the permission to drink water, he can eat increased food with the Guru's permission and drink water, but the one who has observed a Chauvvihar fast cannot eat anything.

**Note:** 1. Nowadays, many spicy items are being made for taste in Ayambil, which is reducing the effect of Ayambil.

The Nature of Water, Extreme and Abstinence Vows

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 129**

One who has observed a fast can only eat after both food and water have increased. If water has not increased, one cannot eat food alone.  Besides the above-mentioned food items, one who observes a vow renounces all four or three of the non-food items.

Now, the vow related to water is called *Paanass Paachchakkhaan*. In this, it is appropriate to observe the *Chauvvihaar Paachchakkhaan* in the excretory system during *Porsi*, *Purimadd*, *Ekaasana*, *Ekalthaana*, *Aayambil*, and fasting vows. However, if one observes the *Trivihaar Paachchakkhaan* and allows water, then six *aagaar* (exceptions) are mentioned for that. They are as follows:

* *Paanass Leyen Ya*, *Aleven Ya*, *Achchen Wa*, *Bahulevan Wa*, *Sasitthen Wa*, *Asitthen Wa* - *Yosirah*.

In the *aagaar* of *Porsi* etc., one should understand the third case as the fifth case, connecting it with the *aagaar* of *Annatthanaabhogenam*.

* *Leyen Wa* - I renounce the three types of food except water with a coating, such as *Osaaman* or *Khajar*, tamarind, etc., or water in a vessel with a coating.

This means that even if one drinks water with a coating after eating during a fast or *Ekaasana* etc., the vow is not broken. The word *Wa* (invariable) is present with each word or in the meaning. One should understand that all types of water, with or without a coating, etc., are specifically mentioned in the *Paanass* vow as unavoidable.

* *Aleven Wa* - Water that does not have a coating, but is filtered water from buttermilk, etc., in a vessel, etc., does not break the vow due to this *aagaar*.

* *Achchen Wa* - Water boiled three times, pure and clean water.

* *Bahulevan Wa* - Water used for washing sesame seeds or raw rice, called *Bahul Jal* or *Gudal Jal*.

* *Sasitthen Wa* - Water from cooked rice or *Maand*, grains, or *Osaaman*, filtered through a cloth.

* *Asitthen Wa* - Water filtered from flour particles, should be understood as similar to the *aagaar* of this type of water.

Now, regarding the extreme renunciation, it is said that *Charam* means the final vow. It has two divisions: one is for the final part of a day, and the other is for the final part of life. These two vows are called *Divascharim* and *Bhavarchim*, respectively. *Bhavarchim* renunciation is for as long as life lasts. Both have four *aagaar* each, which are mentioned in the following sutra:

* *Divascharim*, *Bhavarchim* Ya *Paachchakkwai*; *Chauvvihan Pi Aahaaram Asanam Paanam Khaaim* *Saim* *Annatthanaabhogenam* *Sahasaagaaren* *Mahattaraagaaren* *Savyasamaahiyattiaagaaren* *Yosirah*.

Here, there is a doubt that if *Ekaasana* etc., vows are also observed in the same way, then what is the need for *Divascharim* vow? Therefore, the *Divascharim* vow is useless. The solution is that this is not true. *Ekaasana* etc., have eight *aagaar*, including *Annatthanaabhogenam*, etc., while *Divascharim* has only four *aagaar*. Therefore, this vow is successful because it has fewer *aagaar* (exceptions).

Although the renunciation of the evening meal by monks and nuns is lifelong, and the *Ekaasana* etc., vows of householders are also until sunrise the next day (because the word *Divas* means day, and it also means "day and night" or *Aho-raatra*. The word *Aho-raatra* is also a synonym for *Divas*), still, the *Divascharim* renunciation in the form of renunciation of the evening meal reminds those monks and lay followers of that vow again, and therefore it is successful.

*Bhavarchim* vow has only two *aagaar*. In this, the *aagaar* of *Sarvasamadhi-pratyaya* and *Mahattaraagaar* are not needed. Only the two *aagaar* of *Anaabhog* and *Sahasaakaar* are sufficient for *Bhavarchim* vow. These two *aagaar* are included in this vow because it is possible to use something useless or to put a finger, etc., in the mouth. This is because the one who observes the extreme renunciation cannot completely renounce these two *aagaar*.

Now, the nature of the abstinence vow is explained. To make a resolution or rule in accordance with the renunciation of austerity in some form is called *Abhigraha*. It is in the form of various rules, such as cleaning and writing the punishment, allowing to get up, etc.

The text discusses the concepts of *Abhiggah* and *Viggai* *Paccakkhan* and their interpretations.

**Abhiggah Paccakkhan**

* It refers to the renunciation of *Abhiggah* (attachment).
* It involves four *Agars* (stages).
* The sutra states: "Abhiggaham Paccckkhaai, Annatthanaabhogenaam, Sahaasaagaarenaam, Mahattaraagaarenaam, Savvasamaahivattiaagaarenaam Vosirai."
* The meaning of these terms has been explained previously.
* If a monk renounces clothes as part of *Abhiggah* *Paccakkhan*, a fifth *Agar* called *Cholapattaagaarenaam* is added.
* This *Agar* allows the monk to wear a *Cholapatta* (a type of cloth) in case of necessity without breaking the *Paccakkhan*.

**Viggai Paccakkhan**

* It involves eight or nine *Agars*.
* The sutra states: "Viggaio Paccckkhaai, Annatthanaabhogenaam, Sahaasaagaarenaam, Levaalevenaam, Gihatthasansatenaam, Ukhittvivegaenaam, Paducchammakkhienaam, Paritthavaaniyagaarenaam, Mahattaraagaarenaam, Savyasamaahiyattiaagaarenaam Vosirah."
* *Viggai* refers to substances that cause mental disturbances.
* There are ten types of *Viggai*:
    1. Milk
    2. Yogurt
    3. Ghee
    4. Butter
    5. Oil
    6. Jaggery
    7. Alcohol
    8. Honey
    9. Meat
    10. Fried foods

**Details of each type of Viggai:**

* **Milk:** Milk from cows, buffaloes, goats, camels, and sheep is considered *Viggai*.
* **Yogurt:** Yogurt from all except camels is *Viggai*.
* **Ghee and Butter:** Ghee and butter from the same animals as milk are *Viggai*.
* **Oil:** Oils from sesame, flaxseed, coconut, and mustard (including *Laha*) are *Viggai*. Other oils are considered *Lepkrut* (not *Viggai* but allowed for external use).
* **Jaggery:** Both soft and hard jaggery made from sugarcane or palm juice is *Viggai*. This includes sugar, brown sugar, *Mishri*, and sweets made from them.
* **Alcohol:** Both *Kasthajan* (made from sugarcane, palm, etc.) and *Pishtajan* (made from fermented flour) alcohol are *Viggai* and should be completely avoided.
* **Honey:** Honey from bees, *Kunta* (a flying insect), and *Bhramari* (a type of bee) is *Viggai*.
* **Meat:** Meat from aquatic, terrestrial, and aerial animals is *Viggai*. This includes skin, fat, blood, marrow, and bones.
* **Fried Foods:** All fried foods like *Jalebi*, *Bade*, *Pakode*, etc., are *Viggai*.

**The concept of *Aavgaah* and *Neevi* (Non-Viggai):**

* *Aavgaah* refers to the process of frying food in oil or ghee.
* *Neevi* refers to food that is not *Viggai*.
* According to some scholars, food fried four times is considered *Neevi*.
* Monks who are practicing *Yogodvahan* (intense spiritual practice) can consume *Neevi* food that has been fried three times, provided no additional oil or ghee is added.
* Some scholars also believe that if a large *Pooa* (a type of fried food) is fried in a pan so that it completely covers the oil or ghee, then the second frying of other foods in the same oil is considered *Neevi* for monks practicing *Yogodvahan*.
* However, all such foods are considered *Lepkrut*.

**Conclusion:**

* Out of the ten types of *Viggai*, meat and alcohol are completely forbidden.
* Honey and *Navneet* (fresh butter) are also generally forbidden.
* The remaining six types of *Viggai* are allowed for consumption.
* Monks practicing *Yogodvahan* can consume *Neevi* food under certain conditions.

## Method of Counting and Purification of the Repositories of All Pacchakkhanas

The Pacchakkhana of the Yoga Shastra, Third Light, up to verse 129, can be taken individually or all the Viggais can be taken together with the Nivi Pacchakkhana. The meaning of the repositories should be understood as before. These are the specific repositories:

**Gihatth-Sansadvenam:** If a householder has mixed rice in milk for themselves, and after adding the rice, the milk is four fingers high (in the vessel), then they are not considered a Viggai. It is a Sansrushtdravya and is acceptable in Nivi Pacchakkhana, but if the milk is more than four fingers high, then it is counted as a Viggai. Similarly, the repository of Sansrushtdravya in other Viggais should be known from the Agamas. This means that if a householder consumes Sansrushtdravya in Nivi, their Pacchakkhana is not broken due to this repository.

**Uktittviveganam:** Even though there is a renunciation of hard substances like sugar, etc., as mentioned in the repositories from Ayambil, if a particle of a hard substance like jaggery, etc., remains and is consumed, the Pacchakkhana is not broken. However, this repository (exception) is only for hard Viggais, not for liquid Viggais.

**Paducchamkkhiyenam:** If a householder applies a small amount of ghee to a dry roti, etc., to make it soft, and it is consumed, this Pacchakkhana is not broken due to the repository called "Pratiitya-prakshit", provided that the taste of ghee is not perceived at all. If a small amount of oil, ghee, etc., that is on the finger gets on the roti, etc., and is consumed, this Pacchakkhana is not broken. However, eating with ghee, etc., specifically added is not permissible for those who have the Pacchakkhana of the Dharaviggai.

In this way, by taking care of the repositories mentioned for Nivi Pacchakkhana through Viggai-tyaga and Upalakshana, I renounce the rest of the Voshir-tyaga. If a piece of jaggery is kept in a Viggai that has been renounced, it can be picked up and the Viggai can be taken. From this perspective, there are nine repositories for the Jaggery Viggai and eight repositories for the milk, etc., liquid Viggais.

Here we present the meaning of the Agama-gatha that supports this point, which reveals the repositories:

There are two repositories for the Namukkarasahya (Naukarasi) Pacchakkhana, six for the Porasi, seven for the Purimat (Purvardha) Pacchakkhana, eight for the Ekasan, five for the Upvas, six for the Upvasadi with water, four for the Divascharam and Bhavcharam Pratyakhyana, four for the Abhigha, or four others, and eight or nine for the Nivi. Among these, there are five repositories in the A-pravarana Abhigha and four in the remaining Abhigha Pacchakkhana. (A. Ni. 1612-1614)

Here there is a doubt: If the repositories mentioned for Nivi are mentioned under the Viggai-tyaga form of Pacchakkhana, then someone does not renounce all Viggais, but keeps some Viggais, or renounces only some Viggais; how should the repositories be understood in such Viggai-Pacchakkhana? The solution is that the Parimit-Viggai-Pacchakkhana should also be taken along with the Nivi Pacchakkhana. The same repositories should be understood in that as well. That is, the repositories mentioned in Nivi are also the repositories in the (Parimit) Viggai Pacchakkhana. Similarly, the Pacchakkhana of Biyasana should be understood along with Ekasan, Sadhporasi along with Porasi, and Avadd along with Purimadd. It is not inappropriate to speak of these Pacchakkhanas along with the increase in A-pramatata. Since the repositories related to Ekasan, etc., are the same, they should be understood in Porasi, Sadhporasi, etc. Because the repositories in Chauvvihar are the same as the repositories in Trivihar, Duvihar Pacchakkhana, similarly, the repositories of Biyasana, etc., and Ekasan, etc., are similar due to the similarity of the word Asanadi.

Here there is a doubt: If the Biyasana, etc., Pacchakkhana is of the Abhigha form, then there should be four repositories, why more? The solution is that it has similarity with them due to its acceptance, observance, and protection, just like Ekasan, etc. Therefore, there should be the same number of repositories in Biyasana as well. Other Acharyas believe that the Pacchakkhanas of Biyasana, etc., are not counted in the original Pacchakkhanas. The original ten Pacchakkhanas are Ekasan, etc., so that is correct. If someone is unable to perform the Ekasan, etc., Pacchakkhana, then they can perform the Porasi, etc., mentioned Pacchakkhana according to their feeling and ability. For those who desire even greater benefit, it is appropriate to perform the Pratyakhyana with Ganthisahit, Muththisahit, etc., along with that (Porasi, etc.). Because the Ganthisahit, etc., Pacchakkhana also increases the A-pramattadash and is fruitful. These...

## The Conduct of a Shravak Before and After Sleep

**Chapter 3, Light 3, Verse 130**

The **Paccakkhanna** are those with qualities like touch, etc., and are called **Supratyakhyana**. In support of this, it is said that for the sake of the right understanding of all **Pratyakhyanas**, there are six types: **Fasiyam**, **Paliyam**, **Sohiyam**, **Tiriyam**, **Kittiyam**, **Arahiyam**. In this way, the purification of **Pratyakhyana** occurs in the aforementioned six ways.

1. **Fasiyam (Touched)** - At the time of **Pratyakhyana**, obtaining its touch according to the method.
2. **Paliyam (Protected)** - Repeatedly remembering the accepted **Pratyakhyana** through use, keeping it well-protected, preventing it from being broken, or nurturing it.
3. **Sohiyam (Adorned)** - From the received food, first giving to the Guru, ascetic, child, sick, elderly, etc., and then consuming the remaining food oneself.
4. **Tiriyam (Passed)** - After the duration of **Pratyakhyana** is complete, remaining stable for a short time and then eating.
5. **Kittiyam (Celebrated)** - While performing according to **Pratyakhyana**, remembering that "I have accepted this particular **Pratyakhyana** today," eating, or praising the importance of the **Pratyakhyana** that has been accepted - this is also called **Kittiyam**.
6. **Arahiyam (Worshiped)** - With all these types of purification, keeping the **Agara** in mind, putting the accepted **Pratyakhyana** into practice.

After the explanation, two types of fruits are mentioned. By performing **Paccakkhanna**, the doors of future karmas are closed; this leads to the destruction of desire and thirst. With the cessation of thirst, unparalleled peace arises; due to this, **Pratyakhyana** becomes pure. Through pure **Pratyakhyana**, the seeker attains the true nature of **Charitra Dharma**. This leads to the depletion of old karmas, through which the seeker gradually attains **Ganasthana** and one day attains **Kevalgyan**. And from **Kevalgyan**, the seeker attains **Moksha**, the eternal state of happiness. In this way, **Pratyakhyana** is the giver of **Moksha** through tradition.

Thus, the description of the nature of **Pratyakhyana** and the six essentials is complete. For a **Shravak**, only **Chaityavandan** etc. are necessary to do, he does not need to perform these six essentials; this should never be stated. Therefore, it is said that for a **Shraman** or **Shravak**, these (six) are the necessary actions to be performed at the end of the night or day, therefore they are called **Aavashyak** (**Pratikraman**). Similarly, in the **Agam**, the **Shravak** is also told to perform **Pratikraman** etc. It is not appropriate to mention **Aavashyak** like **Chaityavandan** etc. here. Because the rule of **Pratikraman** etc. **Aavashyak** is stated as **Anto Aho-Nississ**, meaning both at the end of the day and night; whereas the rule of **Chaityavandan** is for all three times. In the **Anuyogadwar Sutra**, while describing the characteristics of **Lokottar Aavashyak**, it is said regarding its importance: "Those **Sadhu-Sadhvi** or **Shravak-Shravika** who are focused on the **Aavashyak Sutra** and its meaning, become absorbed in it, are engrossed in that **Leshya**, use it in its meaning, dedicate all three **Karana** to it, and are imbued with its feeling, perform **Aavashyak** (**Pratikraman** etc.) at both times; their **Aavashyak** should be understood as **Lokottar Bhava-Aavashyak**." According to this **Agam** statement, there is a rule for **Shravaks** to perform **Aavashyak** (**Pratikraman** etc.).

After performing the six **Aavashyak**, the **Shravak** should study, contemplate the **Anuvrat** method, or recite the **Panchparameshthinamaskaramantra** garland, or use the time by performing five types of study. These five types of study are: 1. **Vachanashastra** or reading scriptures, 2. **Pricchana** - asking questions about the subject, 3. **Paryatana** - repeatedly reviewing the learned knowledge so that it is not forgotten, 4. **Anupreksha** - discussing with each other about subtle matters and becoming free from doubt, or thinking and meditating accordingly, 5. **Dharmakatha** - giving or listening to a **Dharmakatha** or lecture on scriptural subjects.

If the **Sadhu-Sadhvi** do not have the ability to go and listen to lectures and teachings, or if there is a king or a great **Shravak**, or if there is an obstacle or difficulty in going out, then they should perform **Aavashyak**, study, etc. at home. This is **Uttamanirjarahethum** - the cause of the best depletion. It is also said that "**Shrijineshwar** has described twelve types of **Tap** externally and internally, there is no **Tap** like study, nor will there be, nor has there been." (**Panch. V. 562**) It is also said that "Through study, there is meditation, and through study, the ultimate truth can also be known; the soul, absorbed in study, attains detachment every moment." (**Upadesh Mala 338**) || 129 ||

## The Example of Sthulabhadra Muni

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verses 130-131**

Thus, the meaning of the 129th verse is complete.

**130.**  After the proper time, purified by the remembrance of the Devas and the Guru, the Shravak should engage in minimal sleep, mostly abstaining from Brahma-violation.

**Meaning:** After engaging in Swadhyay (self-study) and other practices, how should the Shravak engage in minimal sleep? This is explained: The soul, purified by remembering the Bhattarak Shri Arihanta, the Devas, the Dharmacharayas, and the Guru Maharaj, should, by implication, accept the four refuges, condemn sinful actions, and approve virtuous actions, remembering the five Supreme Beings. Without remembering all of these, the soul cannot be purified. Therefore, one should remember Shri Vitaragdeva in this way: "Namo Viyaraagaanam Savvannuunam Tilokkapuijiaanam Jahdwiyavathu Vaainam," meaning, "Salutations to Shri Vitarag, the omniscient, the revered of the three worlds, the true expounder of the essence of things." After this, one should remember the Gurudev in this way: "Dhannyaaste Graam-Nagar-Janapadaadayo Yeshu Madiyya Dharmaachaarya Viharanti," meaning, "Blessed are those villages, cities, countries, and provinces where my Dharmacharaya Gurudev resides." One should contemplate in this way before going to sleep and after waking up. In minimal sleep, "sleep" is the thing being described, and "minimal" is the description. Here, "minimal" is prescribed, not "sleep." Because in a sentence where there is a prescription or prohibition with a description, the prescription is directed towards the description, not the thing being described. By this logic, "taking sleep" is not prescribed here. Sleep arises on its own due to the arising of the Darshanavaraniya Karma. It is considered successful when the scriptures explain something that is not already known. Therefore, here, the prescription is for the "minimal" aspect of sleep.

**130.** And the householder mostly abandons Brahma-violation, which is sexual indulgence.

**131.** When one wakes up from sleep, one should contemplate the true nature of the body parts of women, as Sthulabhadra and other saints did, remembering their renunciation of women.

**Meaning:** When one wakes up at night, one should contemplate the impurity, repulsiveness, and emptiness of the body parts of women, as Sthulabhadra and other saints did, and remembering their renunciation of women, one should contemplate the true nature of one's own body.

**The Story of Sthulabhadra Muni**

The tradition of Sthulabhadra Muni is passed down through generations.

**The Great Muni Sthulabhadra, Conqueror of Desire:**

On the banks of the beautiful Ganges River, in the city of Pataliputra, which was illuminated by the moonlight of the night sky and whose splendor surpassed the brilliance of the lotus pond, ruled King Nanda, who was like the Lord of Welfare, the ruler of the three regions, and the destroyer of the enemy's army. His chief minister was Shakatala, who was like a protector in times of trouble, a repository of wisdom free from trouble. His elder son, Sthulabhadra, was sharp-witted, adorned with virtues like humility, handsome, well-proportioned, and a source of joy like the moon. And his younger son, Shriyak, was a source of joy to King Nanda's heart, devoted like sandalwood paste. In the same city lived a courtesan named Kosha, who was as beautiful and radiant as Urvashi, captivating the hearts of the people. Sthulabhadra spent his days and nights immersed in various pleasures and amusements with her. Twelve years passed by in this way. Shriyak, the son of Shakatala, was like a second heart to King Nanda, a trusted confidant and bodyguard. In the same city lived a Brahmin named Vararuchi, who was a leader among poets, orators, and grammarians. He was so intelligent that he composed 108 new verses every day in praise of the king. But because Vararuchi the poet had a wrong view, Shakatala the minister never praised him. Therefore, King Nanda was pleased with him but did not give him any gifts. Knowing the reason for not receiving gifts, Vararuchi began to serve Shakatala's wife. Pleased with Vararuchi's service, one day the minister's wife asked him, "Brother, is there anything you need?"

The Mutual Rivalry of Shakatal Minister and Vararuchi Pandit

Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 131: Tell me! Vararuchi said, "Enough, sister! The only thing is that your husband should praise my poems in front of the king." On this request, the minister's wife, seeing an opportunity one day, mentioned this to the minister. He said, "How can I praise that one with false vision?" Still, due to his wife's insistent pleas, the minister agreed. It is true, "The stubbornness of a child, a woman, and a fool is strong." One day, Vararuchi was presenting his composed poetry in front of King Nandraja, when the chief minister praised him, saying, "Oh, beautiful and well-spoken!" On this, the king gave him one hundred and eight gold coins as a reward. Indeed, words spoken in favor of a kingly man are life-giving. Now, Vararuchi began to receive one hundred and eight gold coins daily from the king.

One day, Shakatal Minister asked the king, "Why do you give donations to Vararuchi?" The king said, "Minister, you praised him, so I give him. If I had to give, wouldn't I have given before? But from the day you praised him, I started giving him donations." The minister said, "Lord, I did not praise him; I praised other poems at that time. He presents poems made by others as his own in front of you." The king asked, "Is this true?" The minister said, "Of course! My daughter can also speak these poems." I will give you direct proof tomorrow. Shakatal had seven daughters: Yaksha, Yakshadutta, Bhuta, Bhootdutta, Sena, Vena, and Rena. All seven were intelligent. The first (Yaksha) could remember after hearing once, the second after hearing twice, the third after hearing thrice, and so on, the seventh daughter could remember after hearing seven times. The next day, the minister seated his seven daughters in front of the king behind a curtain so that no one could see them. As usual, Pandit Vararuchi presented 108 new verses. Immediately after, the minister's Yaksha and the other seven daughters repeated those verses exactly as they were. Hearing Vararuchi-composed verses from the mouths of the girls seven times, the king was extremely disgusted. He stopped giving donations to Vararuchi. It is true, ministers have means for both harm and benefit.

Vararuchi also came up with a plan. He went to the banks of the Ganges and installed a device in the water of the Ganges. Along with the device, he would tie one hundred and eight gold coins in a cloth bag beforehand. Then, in the morning, he would praise the Ganges, and at that time, he would press the device with his foot, causing all the coins to jump into his hand. He did this every day. His fame spread throughout the city. Great curiosity arose among the citizens. They came to see him, amazed and bewildered. Slowly, this matter reached the king's ears. Therefore, the king called the minister and praised Vararuchi in front of him. The minister said, "If this is true, then you should come and see it yourself in the morning." After this, the minister instructed a trusted person to secretly find out the truth. He went there and hid in the hollow of a tree like a bird and watched what Vararuchi did. Meanwhile, Vararuchi silently placed the bag of one hundred and eight gold coins in the device installed in the Ganges water and went home. After he left, the secret man stealthily took the bag of gold coins, his life's wealth, and went straight to Shakatal Minister. He called him aside and silently handed him the bag and told him the whole secret. As the night passed, the minister went to the Ganges River with the king, carrying the bag with him. As soon as Vararuchi saw that the king himself had come to see this wonder, he became arrogant and, like a fool, began to praise the Ganges loudly and excessively. As soon as the praise was complete, he pressed the device with his foot, but the bag of gold coins did not jump out. Therefore, he was stunned and began to search for the money by putting his hand in the water, but he could not find the bag of money. Therefore, Vararuchi's face fell. He sat there speechless. Then the chief minister teased him, saying, "Is the Ganges not giving back the money you put in earlier, which you are searching for again and again? Here, take your money! Recognize it!" Saying this, the minister placed the bag of gold coins in Vararuchi's hand. Seeing this, Vararuchi's heart sank. That bag of gold coins destroyed all of Vararuchi's reputation. Therefore, he was experiencing a state more unbearable than death. Shakatal Minister said to the king, "Lord, look at his wicked deeds! To deceive people, he

Sthulabhadra, through detachment from the world and the hypocrisy of upakośa, becomes entangled in the scriptures of yoga for the impure death of Varuci. He then performs a morning recitation and accepts this. The king said, "You have very well exposed the deception of this person in my presence." Saying this, the king, with astonished eyes, reached his palace while looking at Varuci.

Varuci became extremely enraged in his mind due to the behavior of the minister Śakaṭāla and decided to take revenge for this insult. One day, Varuci tempted one of the minister's maids and inquired about all the happenings in the minister's house. The maid told him that preparations were being made for the marriage of the minister's son Śrīyaka, and the king had also been invited for the feast. Weapons were also being prepared as gifts for the king, who was fond of weapons. Knowing the minister's weakness, Varuci gathered the children and, after giving them chickpeas to eat, taught them to say in public places, "The king does not know that the minister Śakaṭāla wants to kill the king and install Śrīyaka on the throne." The children started saying this everywhere. Gradually, the people informed the king about this. The king thought, "What children say, what noble women say, and what is spoken in an ominous language is never false." Therefore, the king sent a trusted person to investigate the matter at the minister's house. He found everything as it was and reported it to the king. When the minister presented himself before the king during service, the king turned his face away. The minister immediately understood the king's mood. He came home and told Śrīyaka, "It seems that some enemy has misled the king against us. That is why the king is angry with us. Therefore, my son, if you accept my command, our family will be saved." The command was that when the minister bows down to greet the king, Śrīyaka should immediately cut off the minister's head with a sword, saying that even if he is the father, if he is not loyal to the lord, it is appropriate to kill him. Hearing this, Śrīyaka, with a choked voice, said, "Father, even a Cāṇḍāla does not commit such a heinous act; how can I do it?" Then the minister said, "If you think this way, you will only fulfill the desires of the enemies, and the angry king, like Yama, will kill our entire family. Therefore, if the destruction of one can save the entire family, I will have no regret about it. As for the protection of your dharma, I will keep poison in my mouth while greeting the king, so you can cut off my head, so that you will not incur the sin of patricide." After much persuasion, Śrīyaka reluctantly accepted the proposal, because "wise people make the present time terrible for the auspicious future." Obeying his father's command, Śrīyaka cut off the minister's head in the royal court in front of the king. The king, astonished, asked Śrīyaka, "My child, why did you commit such a heinous act?" Śrīyaka said, "You saw that my father was a traitor to the king, so I killed him. Servants always behave according to the wishes of their master. If a fault is seen in oneself, it is worth considering, but if a fault is seen in a servant by the master, it is appropriate to immediately remedy it, and there is no need for further consideration."

After the last rites of the deceased minister Śakaṭāla, King Nandarāja called Śrīyaka and said, "You take charge of the entire administration of the kingdom, and here is the minister's seal." Śrīyaka, after paying obeisance to the king, said, "O lord! My elder brother Sthulabhadra, who, by the grace of my father, is happily enjoying life with the courtesan Upakośā, is the first entitled to the office of the minister. " Hearing this, the king summoned Sthulabhadra and asked him to accept the minister's seal. Then Sthulabhadra said, "I will first carefully consider this."

The Death of Varruchi - The Chaturmas at Kosha's Place

Thinking deeply, I can only obey your command. The king said, "Think about it today." Upon hearing this, Sthulabhadra went to Ashoka Vana and thought, "A royal servant is like a poor man, he cannot enjoy the comforts of sleep, food, bath, etc. at the right time. Just as there is no room for more water in a full pot, similarly, the mind of a royal servant, who is engrossed in the worries of the kingdom, has no room for even a little bit of space for his beloved life. He dedicates all his personal interests to the service of the king, yet, just as crows peck at a tied animal, wicked people harass him. He, the wise man, exerts himself to the utmost in serving the king by squeezing out his body and wealth, can he not exert himself equally for his soul? Thinking thus, Sthulabhadra became detached from the world. He himself performed the Panchmusti Kesha-Loch and, wearing the robes of a sage, made a Rajoharan of the ten Ratnakambals. He immediately entered the mighty royal court. He requested the king, "I have decided to live in this state, and you will benefit from Dharma." Saying these words of blessing, he left the mighty royal court in the same way a lion emerges from a cave. The king, sitting by the window, saw Sthulabhadra leaving and thought, "Is he pretending to be detached and going to a prostitute's place?" But when the king learned that he was leaving the brothel in the same way a man would wrinkle his nose and walk away from a foul-smelling corpse, he shook his head and thought, "Surely, the Lord has become a renunciate. I made a wrong assumption about him." Thus, he praised Sthulabhadra while self-reproaching. Shri Sthulabhadra also went to Acharya Shri Sambhutivijay and, after reciting the Samayik-path, accepted initiation. After this, Nandraja, with great honor, gave the minister's seal, the responsibility of the entire state administration, into the hands of Shriyak and entrusted him with all the powers of the minister. Shriyak also always maintained the state administration with excellent justice and skill, as if he were Sakatal himself. He went to Kosha's place with humility. Due to the affectionate bond of brotherhood, his beloved also treated him with respect. Kosha, saddened by the separation from Sthulabhadra, cried loudly upon seeing Shriyak. A man who is grieving for his beloved becomes impatient with sorrow. He cannot bear the sorrow in his heart for long. After this, Shriyak said to Kosha, "Arye! Tell me, what can we do about this? The sinner Varruchi had my father murdered. He also caused the untimely separation of Sthulabhadra, like a thunderbolt born in a drought. Therefore, Manasvin! As long as Varruchi has an attachment to your sister Upkosha, think of a way to counter him. Secretly explain to Upkosha and, under any pretext, make Varruchi addicted to drinking alcohol." To avenge the separation of his beloved, he agreed to do this with the cunning of his brother-in-law and quietly explained everything to Upkosha. Following Kosha's advice, her younger sister Upkosha did the same. She forced Varruchi to drink alcohol. What can a woman not make her enslaved man do? After making Varruchi drink alcohol according to her wishes, Upkosha went to her sister Kosha in the morning and told her everything. Kosha informed Shriyak of everything. Hearing this, Shriyak thought, "Today, I have taken revenge for my father's death well." After the death of the great minister Sakatal, Varruchi was eager to serve the king. He was always present in every activity of the royal family. Therefore, the king and the people respected him. Once, remembering the qualities of the minister Sakatal, Nandraja, with a choked voice, said to Shriyak in the gloomy royal court, "Just as Brihaspati is in Indra's court, so was the powerful, wise, and great minister Sakatal in my service. But by the will of fate, he passed away. Truly, without him, this royal court seems empty to me." Shriyak also said, "Dev! Your words are absolutely true. But what can we do about this? All this is the work of the drunken sinner Varruchi Bhatta." The king asked, "Does he also drink alcohol?" Shriyak said, "Dev! I will show you directly tomorrow." To witness this curiosity, all the men came to the royal court the next day. A beautiful lotus was offered to all the members of the assembly, including the king.

## The Successful Chaturmas of Sthulabhadra Muni at the House of Koshaveshya

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 131** | A trusted person, who had explained it earlier, first gave Madanphal juice to the wicked Vararuchi. | A beautiful lotus was presented. Such an amazing fragrance and such beauty is in this lotus; where could it be from? Thus | praising the lotus, the king and everyone else put their lotus to their noses. Vararuchi Bhatta also kept his lotus near his nose out of curiosity to smell it. As soon as he smelled the lotus, he vomited (Vaman) the Chandrahas-madhira he had drunk at night. Shame on this wicked man who is worthy of the death penalty in the Brahmin caste for drinking alcohol! Thus, | rejected by everyone, Vararuchi ran out of the assembly. Later, for his purification, he sought atonement from the Brahmin-pandits. | They said - the sin of drinking alcohol can only be purified by the atonement of drinking boiling hot glass juice. Vararuchi also drank the heated glass according to the atonement arrangement given by the Brahmins. | His internal body melted in a short time from drinking the hot glass and his life-birds flew away. Meanwhile, Sthulabhadra Muni also became proficient in the ocean of scriptures while worshipping knowledge, vision, and character in the presence of Acharya Shrisambhutivijay. As the rainy season approached, a Muni bowed to Guru Maharaj Shrisambhutivijay and presented his | Abhigraha (resolution) before him - Gurudev! I will spend the rainy season by fasting for four months and standing in Kaussagg (meditation) at the door of the lion's cave. Another Muni requested that I would spend four months fasting and doing Kaussagg near the nest of the Dristivisha serpent. The third Muni requested to spend four months fasting and doing Kaussagg from Mandukasana on the threshold of the well. Knowing all three sadhus to be worthy of Abhigraha, Guru Maharaj gave his permission. At that time, Sthulabhadra Muni bowed in service to Guru Maharaj and requested - Prabhu! I have made such an Abhigraha | that I will spend the four months of the rainy season eating food with six tastes, without performing penance in the picture gallery of Koshaveshya, which is full of strange Karana, Asana, etc., as mentioned in the Kama Shastra, and stimulating pictures of Shringar Rasa. Guru Maharaj looked at it with the use of Shrutagyan and knowing Sthulabhadra to be worthy of the said Abhigraha, gave his permission. Therefore, all four sadhus reached their designated places to fulfill their designated Abhigraha. Sthulabhadra Muni also reached the | door of Koshaveshya's house. As soon as Kosha got to know, she came out and stood there with folded hands to welcome him. Kosha | thought after seeing the Muni - by nature, he is delicate, unable to lift the burden of the great vow with thighs like a banana stem, | Munishri has come to my place. Therefore, immediately Kosha said - Swamin! Welcome! Please come in and give me Amba's command | what should I do? This body, mind, wealth, family is all yours. Sthulabhadra Muni said - Bhadre! Give me your picture gallery to stay in during the Chaturmas. In reply, Kosha said - Swamin! Please accept it with pleasure. And she | cleaned and dusted her picture gallery and prepared it for their stay. Therefore, Muni Sthulabhadra entered that picture gallery, which was like a place of work for Dharma, with his self-strength. After that, she would give him food with six tastes every day. Thereafter | from time to time, she would sit in front of the Muni, adorned with sixteen ornaments, to distract him from his vow; at that | time she looked like a beautiful Apsara. In this way, she started dancing, singing, gestures, glances, etc. skillfully to attract the Muni. She also started reminding him again and again of Karana, Asana, previously enjoyed Shringar-Krida, strong Suratkrida, etc. This means that Kosha tried all the aphrodisiac measures that could be used to distract the great Muni. But all those measures were futile like scratching a nail on a diamond. In this way, she tried to disturb the Muni every day. But he | did not get disturbed at all. Rather, the more Kosha, who was attacking the great Muni with upsarga, made favorable upsargas, the more the fire of meditation of the great Muni became more and more ignited; just as lightning becomes particularly bright from the rain clouds. Finally, Koshaveshya lost. She admitted her mistake and bowing down said - Swamin! | I used to expect Kamakrida with you like before because of my foolishness; but you remained firm like a rock. Shame on me! Thus, repenting, she bowed at the feet of the Muni. Impressed by the peak of the Muni's victory over the senses, Kosha accepted the Shravak Dharma and made such an Abhigraha that - if by chance

##  The Successful Chaturmas of Sthulabhadra Muni at the House of Koshaveshya

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 131:**  The king is pleased and even if he has to offer his body, I would abandon all other men except that one man. In this way, Sthulabhadra Muni completed the Chaturmas happily. 

The three Munis completed their Chaturmas according to their respective vows and reached the feet of their Guru. The Sadhu who resided in the lion's cave arrived, and the Guru, standing up, said to him, "Dushkarakar, Vats! I welcome you." Similarly, two other Sadhus also arrived, and the Guru Maharaj welcomed them both by calling them "Dushkarakar." The Swami also gives equal respect to those who make similar vows. 

After this, the fully vowed Sthulabhadra also came to serve the Gurudev. Then, the Guru Maharaj stood up and said, "Dushkar-Dushkarakar! Mahatman, I welcome you." Hearing this, the first Muni who had arrived became envious and burned with jealousy. He thought to himself, "The Guruji has taken the side of Sthulabhadra Muni because he is the son of a minister and has addressed him with the best words. If the work of the one who eats six meals is Dushkar-Dushkar, then I will also make the same vow next year." He decided this in his mind. 

The Muni, having practiced restraint for eight months, completed it. As the rainy season approached, the Sadhu who resided in the lion's cave, like a debtor, happily reached the Guru Maharaj and repeated his vow. "Bhagavan! This year, I will spend the Chaturmas staying at the house of Kosha-Veshhya, always eating food with six tastes." The Gurudev, using his knowledge, observed and thought that this vow was taken only out of envy for Sthulabhadra. Therefore, he said, "Vats! This vow is Dushkarati-Dushkar. You are not capable of fulfilling it! Therefore, do not make such a vow. Only Sthulabhadra, who is as steady as Mount Meru, is capable of fully passing this vow." 

Upon this, the Muni protested and said to the Guru, "For me, this is not difficult at all, so where is the question of Dushkar-Dushkar?" Therefore, I will surely succeed in this vow." The Guru said, "This vow will corrupt you for the future and also destroy your past tapasya and restraint. Because carrying more weight than your strength can handle destroys your limbs." But the Muni, who considered himself powerful, rejected the Guru's words and set out towards the house of Koshaganika, which was like the abode of Kamadeva. 

Seeing the Muni approaching from afar, Kosha thought, "It seems that this Muni is coming to me only out of envy for Sthulabhadra Muni. Still, as a Shravika, I should save him from falling." Thinking this, the Veshhya stood up and bowed to the Muni. The Muni asked the virtuous Kosha for her painting gallery for four months. She readily opened the painting gallery and allowed him to stay there. The Muni entered and stayed there. 

After eating food with six tastes, at midday, Kosha, the repository of beauty and grace, came to test the Muni. As soon as the Muni saw Kosha's lotus-like eyes, he became immediately filled with desire. With such a beautiful woman and such delicious food with various flavors, how could desire not arise? The Muni, afflicted by lust, requested sexual intercourse from Kosha. In response, Kosha said, "Bhagavan! We are Veshhyas! We can only be controlled by giving money." The Muni said, "Mrigalochane! Be pleased with me; but if oil can be obtained from sand, then wealth can be obtained from us. This is impossible, my dear!" 

Kosha, to awaken the Muni, said to him, "Why is it impossible? The king of Nepal, if he meets someone for the first time, whom he has never seen before, gives him a jeweled blanket. Therefore, go there and bring a jeweled blanket." Kosha had said this to make the Muni become detached, but the Muni completely believed her words and, rejecting his Sadhu-maryada, even though the rainy season was full of obstacles, like a child, he mixed his vows with the mud of sin and set out from there during the Chaturmas. 

Reaching Nepal, the Muni returned with a jeweled blanket from the king, but on the way, he saw a group of thieves, where many thieves lived. They had a parrot as a pet. Seeing the Muni, he said, "One worth a lakh is coming." Hearing this, the king of the thieves, sitting on a tree, asked another thief, "Who is coming?" He said, "A Bhikshu is coming, and he doesn't seem to have anything with him." When the Sadhu came near, the thieves caught him and searched him thoroughly. But they found nothing on him. Therefore, the thieves, knowing him to be penniless, let him go. But as he was leaving,

Koshā, the courtesan, awakens the Muni (ascetic) and the Rathakāra (charioteer) residing in the lion cave.

After the 131st verse of the third chapter of the Yogaśāstra, the parrot spoke again - "This is worth a hundred thousand (coins) and is being taken away." Therefore, the chief of the thieves asked him again, "O Bhikkhu! Tell the truth! What do you have?" Then the Muni said to him, "What can I hide from you? I had obtained a precious Nepal-nara ratnakaṃbala (a valuable blanket) to give to the courtesan. I have hidden it in a bamboo tube. If you want, I can give it to you." The thieves, thinking the Muni was a Bhikkhu, let him go.

The Muni then directly reached the place of Koshā, the courtesan, and offered her the ratnakaṃbala. Seeing the Muni, Koshā immediately and fearlessly threw him into a dirty drain. The Muni said, "O Bhadre! You have thrown this extremely valuable and hard-earned ratnakaṃbala into the dirty drain. O Śaṃkhagrivā! Did you not consider anything while throwing it?" To this, Koshā sharply said, "O deluded Muni! You are concerned about this ratnakaṃbala, but you are throwing the gem-like Muni-life, which is full of virtuous conduct, into the dirty pit of passions; do you have any concern for that?"

Hearing this, the Muni was suddenly awakened. Shaken by Koshā's strong rebuke, he turned towards renunciation. Composing himself, he said to the courtesan, "Sister! You have truly awakened me from sleep. You have given me a beautiful awakening and saved me from drowning in the ocean of the world. You have indeed done a great deed. Now I am healthy and am going to the feet of my Gurumaharāja to eradicate the transgressions (sins-faults) in my life of restraint." Koshā also said to the Muni, "Due to you, I became a sinner, for which I say 'Micchāmi Dukkaḍaṃ' (I seek forgiveness). While being absorbed in the vow of celibacy, I tried to disturb you, and I had this hope of you going to Nepal and awakening you; for that, I seek your forgiveness, please forgive me. I wish that you now reach the service of your Gurujī soon."

The Muni also reached his Guru and, with self-surrender, began to perform severe austerities as repentance.

One day, pleased, King Nanda sent a charioteer to the courtesan Koshā. But since the courtesan was not under the king's control, she engaged in intercourse with him without affection. In front of the charioteer, she always said that there is no greater person than Sthūlabhadra. The charioteer thought, "Let me show her some miracle, so that she develops affection towards me." Thinking so, one day he went to the garden and sat on a couch, and to entertain Koshā, he demonstrated his scientific skill, piercing a cluster of mangoes with an arrow, then threading other arrows through the previous ones up to his hand, and finally cutting the mango cluster with an arrow in the shape of a weapon. He then offered the mango cluster to the courtesan Koshā.

Seeing this, the courtesan said, "Now see my dance art." Saying this, she had a heap of mustard seeds placed, with a needle standing upright in the middle. She then covered the entire heap with flower petals. Thereafter, she danced on that needle in such a way that neither did the needle hurt her, nor did a single petal move. Pleased by seeing her difficult feat, the charioteer said to Koshā, "Seeing your difficult deed, I am very pleased. Therefore, ask for whatever I have, and I will surely give it to you." To this, the courtesan said, "I have not done any difficult deed that has impressed you so much. In fact, one who practices can do even more difficult deeds. Piercing the mango cluster or dancing on the needle is not difficult, as it can be accomplished through practice. But the deed that Sthūlabhadra has done, without any practice, is truly difficult. He, who continuously enjoyed new sensual pleasures with me for twelve years in the same painting hall, remained unshaken and unwavering in the vows of brahmacarya (celibacy) and other vows for four months in that same place. Just as milk cannot remain pure where crows come and go, similarly, it is difficult for a man to remain untainted in the abode of a woman. Many yogis have been corrupted. Who is capable of remaining unshaken even for a single day in solitude with a woman? Yet, Sthūlabhadra Muni remained celibate for four months. Although his food was delicious, rich in six tastes, his dwelling was in the painting hall, a woman was with him, and there was solitude - still, Sthūlabhadra Muni..."

The third light of the Yoga Shastra, verse 131, did not move from the presence of the great sage, Shthulbhadra Muni, and the other sadhus, to the presence of Shri Bhadrabahu Swami. Just as even a man with a heart as hard as metal melts in the presence of fire, so too do we see Shthulbhadra Muni as being made of vajra (diamond). After describing the great, powerful, and difficult-to-achieve deeds of Shri Shthulbhadra Muni, my mouth does not open to describe another. It is necessary to put a lock on it. Hearing this, the charioteer asked the Kośa, "Who is this great, jewel-crowned Shthulbhadra, whose praise you are singing so highly?" She replied, "The one whose character I have described to you is Shthulbhadra, the son of Shakatal, the minister of King Nanda." Hearing this, the charioteer, with a look of wonder, clasped his hands and said, "Consider me a servant of Shthulbhadra Muni from this day forward." Seeing the charioteer detached from the world, the Kośa gave him knowledge of Dharma, destroying the remaining traces of his slumbering attachment. He was now awakened. Therefore, knowing the opportune moment, the Kośa revealed her own graha (resolve and rules) to him. Hearing this, the charioteer, with eyes wide with wonder, said, "Bhadra! You have awakened me by praising Shthulbhadra Muni. From this day forward, I will walk the path you have shown me. You, with unwavering determination, walk your accepted path with ease and joy. I am leaving now. May you be well." Saying this, the charioteer went directly to the feet of Shthulbhadra Muni and received the Muni-diksha (initiation) from him. 

The venerable Muni Shthulbhadra was also spending his time in the worship of severe vows. Suddenly, a terrible famine lasting twelve years struck. At that time, the entire assembly of sadhus went to the seashore. There too, the shadow of the terrible famine, like the night of Kali, fell. Even the sadhus did not have easy access to food and water. Due to this, there was no study of the scriptures, and the repetition of the Shruta-gyan (scriptural knowledge) was not possible. As a result, the knowledge that was memorized was also forgotten. Without practice and repetition, even the memorized Shruta-gyan of the most intelligent people is lost. Therefore, to save the remaining Shruta-gyan from being lost, the Shri-Sangha (assembly of monks) gathered the Shraman-Sangha (assembly of ascetics) in Pataliputra at that time. They collected all the Angas (parts of the Jain scriptures), their study, and their purpose, from those who remembered them. The twelfth Anga, Drishtivad, was not found. While thinking about it, the Sangha remembered that Shri Bhadrabahu Swami was the knower of Drishtivad. They decided to obtain it from him. Therefore, the Sangha sent two sadhus to call him. The two sadhus reached the service of Muni Bhadrabahu. After paying their respects, they humbly requested him, "Bhagavan! The Shri-Sangha has invited you to Pataliputra." He replied, "I have begun the Maha-pran-dhyan (meditation on the great soul), so I cannot go there." With this disappointing answer, the two sadhus returned to the Shraman-Sangha and told them what Bhadrabahu Swami had said. The Shri-Sangha, angered by this, ordered two other sadhus to go and bring him, saying, "Go to the Acharya (leader) and ask him, 'What punishment should be given to one who does not obey the orders of the Shri-Sangha?'" When they say, "He should be expelled from the Sangha," then you both, together, loudly say to the Acharya, "Then, Bhagavan, you are also subject to that punishment!" The two sadhus went there and said the same to the Acharya. Therefore, Acharya Bhadrabahu said, "The Shri-Sangha should not do this to me. But please send intelligent disciples here. I will give them seven recitations daily while staying here. I will give the first recitation upon returning from begging for alms, the second during the time of study, the third upon returning from outside the city, the fourth at the time of Vikal (a specific time of the day), and the remaining three recitations at the necessary times. In this way, I will give seven recitations daily, so that the work of the Sangha will be done well and my sadhana (spiritual practice) will also be accomplished without obstacles." Hearing this, the two sadhus returned to Pataliputra and presented to the Shri-Sangha what Shri Bhadrabahu had said. The Shri-Sangha was pleased and considered themselves fortunate. The Shri-Sangha, after considering this, sent five hundred monks, including Shthulbhadra, to Pataliputra. Bhadrabahu Swami began to give seven recitations daily to the five hundred monks. However, due to the very short recitations, all the other monks, feeling anxious, returned to their respective places. Only Shthulbhadra Muni remained there. One day, Acharya Bhadrabahu Swami asked Shthulbhadra Muni, "Muni! Are you not troubled by the constant recitations?"

Study of the Twelfth Anga by Sthulabhadra Muni from Acharya Bhadrabahu Swami
Yoga Shastra Third Light Verse 131 Then Sthulabhadra said - Bhagavan! I do not have any anxiety; but the recitation is very little. Acharya Shri said | Now my meditation practice is about to be completed. As soon as it is completed, I will be able to give you recitation as you wish. Meditation
The Acharya Shri started giving Sthulabhadra recitation as per his wish. Almost ten years ago, the study of two Vasts had been completed, after which Shri Bhadrabahu Swami went to Pataliputra and stayed in the garden outside the city. At that time, Sthulabhadra's seven sisters (Sadhvis) who were wandering from village to village also arrived in the same city. When they heard the arrival of Acharya Shri, they came there to pay their respects. After paying their respects to the Guru Maharaj, they asked - Bhagavan! Where is Sthulabhadra Muni? Acharya Shri said - He is on the upper floor of this house. The sisters went to the upper floor to pay their respects to their brother (Sadhu), at that time, seeing the sisters coming, Sthulabhadra Muni took the form of a lion to show some wonder (miracle). Seeing the form of a lion instead of their brother, all the Sadhvis were immediately frightened and ran back and requested the Guru Maharaj - Gurudev! It seems that the elder brother has been eaten by a lion; because there is only a lion sitting there. Acharya Shriji saw in his knowledge and knowing, ordered - Go there and pay your respects to your elder brother. He is there, there is no lion there. So the Sadhvis went back, then they were in their real form. The Sadhvis paid their respects to Sthulabhadra Muni and told their story - Muni! When Shriyak renounced and took initiation, we also took initiation. But he was so hungry every day that he was not able to do even one Ekasan for a single day. During Paryushana, the Sanvatsari Mahaparva came, so I, being the elder sister, said to Shriyak Muni - Brother! Today is the day of the Mahaparva. Therefore, instead of Naukarsi, do Porsi's Pacchakkhan. At my request, he did the same Pacchakkhan. After the Pacchakkhan was completed, I said - Brother! Stay a little longer. And while doing the Dharma Yatra of Chaitya Paripati, you will see Bhagavad, in the meantime, Purimaddha Pacchakkhan will come. He also accepted this. Thereafter, he was asked to do Avadva-Pacchakkhan till the third watch; he also completed it. Then again | I said - Now, after a while, the time for Pratikraman will come; then it will be night. It can be spent comfortably by sleeping. Therefore, now take the Pacchakkhan of fasting. At my insistence, he accepted the Pacchakkhan of fasting. But at night, he was very distressed by hunger, unbearable pain arose in his stomach and in the same, remembering Devadhidev, Gurudev and Namaskaramantra, he died. After dying, he reached Devalok. But by doing so, I have committed the sin of Rishihatya. Therefore, I was sad and asked for atonement from the Shraman Sangh. On this, the Sangh said - You had made him do penance with pure intention. You had no intention of killing him at all. Therefore, you do not have to do any atonement for this. Then I said - If the present Tirthankara Bhagwan says this directly, then my mind can be satisfied; | Only then can I get peace. Otherwise, this thorn will not go away from my heart. On this, the entire Sangh did Kayotsarga, | due to whose effect, Shasan Devi appeared and said - Tell me, what work of yours should I do? The Sangh said - Take these Sadhviji to the present Tirthankara Simandhar Swami. The Devi said - For their unimpeded journey, all of you stay in Kaussagg itself. The Sangh also did the same. Then, in the blink of an eye, the Devi took me to Shri Simandhar Swami. There I paid my respects to the Lord. Knowing the purpose of my coming, Bhagwan said - The Sadhvi who has come from Bharat Kshetra is innocent. Thereafter, 'gracing me, he gave me two Chulikas to reassure me.' With the Devi, I returned to my place here. From there, without any doubt, I offered those two Chulikas to Shri Sangh. Taking permission from this Muni Sthulabhadra, they all came to their shelter.
After the Sadhvis left, when Sthulabhadra Muni came to Acharya Shri for recitation, he refused to give recitation and said - Muni! You are unfit for recitation. Sthulabhadra started remembering that from the time of initiation till today, what crime have I committed. Even after much thought, when he could not remember any mistake of his own; then he 1. There is also a mention of being in a cave.

The True Form of a Woman's Body and Its Gross Body

**Chapter 3, Verse 132-134**

"O Gurudev! What is my offense that you have refused to give me the reading? I don't remember any offense."

The Guru said, "Silence! Sin! What a thing! You don't even remember the offense after committing it?"

As soon as he said this, Sthulabhadra Muni remembered his mistake. At that moment, he fell at the feet of the Guru and began to apologize, saying, "Gurudev! I will never make such a mistake in the future. Please forgive me this time."

"You will not make such a mistake in the future, but you have committed the offense now. Therefore, you should not be given the reading," said Acharya Shri Bhadrabahu Swami.

After that, at the request of Muni Sthulabhadraji, the entire Sangha together prayed to the Guru Maharaj. Even in the face of great anger, only a great soul is capable of being pleased.

Acharya Shri said to the Sangha, "He has done this now, so in the future, the low-minded souls will also use it in the same way. Therefore, let the rest of the Purvas remain with me, let him receive the punishment for this mistake, and the punishment should also be given to the one who reads the Purvas to others."

Later, at the insistence of the Sangha, he examined the situation using his knowledge and realized that the remaining Purvas would not be separated from him, but there was a possibility of separation from other great Munis in the future. "Now, you are not to teach the rest of the Purvas to anyone else."

After this condition was agreed upon, Bhadrabahu Swami gave the reading to Sthulabhadra Muni. In this way, Sthulabhadra Mahamuni became the holder of all the Purvas. Later, he attained the position of Acharya and enlightened beings for the welfare of the future.

Having attained detachment from the relationship with women, Shri Sthulabhadra Muni, immersed in the state of Samadhi, gradually went to the Devaloka.

In this way, the noble Sadhu class and the intelligent Bhavyatmas should contemplate the feelings of renunciation, which is the abandonment of all worldly pleasures. Thus, the brief life story of Sthulabhadra Muni is complete.

**Now, we present the true form of the limbs of women.**

**Verse 132**

"The body of a woman is filled with pieces of liver, excrement, teeth, nose, ear, and tongue, mucus, marrow, semen, blood, bones, etc., and is sewn together with leather strings. It appears beautiful from the outside, but inside it is filled with liver, flesh, excrement, feces, mucus, phlegm, marrow, fat, blood, and bones, etc., with only skin covering it."

**Verse 133**

"If the body of a woman were to be turned inside out, that is, the inner part were to be made the outer and the outer part were to be made the inner, then a lustful man would have to keep watch day and night to protect her from vultures, jackals, etc. Vultures would come to eat during the day, and jackals would come to eat at night, seeing the food, meat, etc. The lustful man would be constantly busy driving them away. He would not get the opportunity to have intercourse with that disgusting body."

**Verse 134**

"If the foolish Kamadeva wants to conquer the entire world with the filthy weapon of a woman's body, then why doesn't he take the insignificant weapon of feathers?

**Explanation:**

If Kamadeva wants to conquer the three worlds with the disgusting weapon of a woman's body, then why doesn't the foolish one take the insignificant weapon of the feathers of crows, etc.?

The point is that if Kamadeva desires to conquer the entire world by bowing down to the worthless and filled with mucus, phlegm, etc., and the juices, blood, flesh, fat, bones, marrow, semen, etc., filthy substances, and the difficult-to-obtain womanly weapon, then why doesn't he take the easily available and unpolluted feathers of crows, etc., and make them his weapon?

He must be foolish to forget this.

**Note:**

In another story, it is mentioned that the original teaching is the same.

The Yoga Shastra, Third Light, verses 135 to 137, contemplate steadfastness in the midst of various movements, painful situations, and adversities. A common saying goes, "If honey is found in the Aak tree growing in one's own courtyard, who would be foolish enough to climb a mountain?" If the desired object is easily attained, no scholar makes any effort. || 134 || And upon waking up, contemplate in this way:
Meaning:
|| 306. This Kamadeva, born of Sankalpa, alas! has made the whole world a mockery. Therefore, I will uproot this Sankalpa, the root of this, and contemplate. || 135 || Oh! This Kamadeva, born of Sankalpa, has made the whole world a mockery. Therefore, I will uproot this Sankalpa, the root of this, and contemplate. || 135 ||
Explanation: - The mere thought or imagination of desire is not considered the actual cause of its origin; yet Sankalpa is its Yoni, i.e., the cause of its origin; this is experienced in the whole world. This Kamadeva has troubled the whole world. 'The whole world' is said because even Brahma, Indra, Mahadeva, etc., who are considered to be worthy individuals, have not escaped its mockery due to the sight, embrace, remembrance, etc., of women. It is heard, in the Puranas, that Brahmaji became the priest in the marriage of Mahadeva and Gauri, Mahadeva had requested love from Parvati, Shri Pati Vishnu had pleaded with the Gopis, Indra was the one who played with the wife of Gautam Rishi, Chandra was attached to Tara, the wife of Brihaspati, and Surya was fascinated by Ashwa. For this reason, Kamadeva has bewildered the world by standing up for such a trivial purpose. This is inappropriate. Therefore, now I will uproot the root of Sankalpa, the root of Kama, which mocks the world; thus, contemplate and meditate on the impurity and insignificance of the female body and the eradication of Sankalpa Yoni (Kama), etc. || 135 || And upon waking up, contemplate in this way:
|| 307 || Whatever defect there may be, contemplate its reaction, going to the delight of those who are free from defects. || 136 ||
Meaning: - Contemplate the remedy (means) to be free from the defects that appear in oneself, keeping in mind the delight of the sages who are free from defects. || 136 ||
Explanation: - The defects that hinder the peaceful mind are raga, dvesha, krodha, mana, maya, moha, lobha, kama, irsya, matsara, etc. Therefore, one should contemplate and meditate to counteract them. The implication is that if there is raga, then contemplate its opposite, vairagya, similarly, in the time of dvesha, contemplate maitri, in the time of krodha, contemplate kshama, in the time of mana, contemplate namrata, in the time of maya, contemplate saralata, in the time of lobha, contemplate santosha, in the time of moha, contemplate viveka, in the time of the origin of kama vikar, contemplate the impurity of the female body, in the time of irsya, contemplate helping the object of irsya in his work or by keeping goodwill towards him, in the time of matsara, contemplate the expression of delight (not feeling sorrow in the mind) = happiness, seeing the progress of others, in this way, one should contemplate the reaction of each defect in the mind. One should never think that it is impossible. Because in this world, many sages and virtuous people are seen; who have renounced even the most stubborn defects and made the soul virtuous. Therefore, it is said - a good householder should contemplate being free from the defects, keeping in mind the delight of the sages who are free from defects. The example of a sage free from defects (ideal life) awakens delight in the soul and makes it easier to abandon the defects that have taken root in the soul. || 136 ||
|| 308. Contemplating the miserable state of existence, steadfastly, in all beings, one should guide them towards the natural bliss of liberation. || 137 ||
Meaning: - Steadfastly, contemplate that the cycle of birth and death is awkward and painful for all beings. Therefore, contemplate in this way, how can all beings in the world attain eternal and natural liberation bliss? || 137 ||
Explanation: - The state of existence of all beings is very unbearable and difficult. A being sometimes goes to the Tiyanga, sometimes to the Naraka, sometimes to the Manushya, and sometimes to the Deva, where he suffers various kinds of tortures. In the Tiyanga, one has to endure the pain of killing, binding, beating, being subservient, hunger, thirst, being burdened with excessive weight, cutting of limbs, etc. In the Naraka, one

Thus it is.
The Story of Kamadeva
Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 138
Due to the provocation of enmity, opposition, and distress from others, and due to the influence of the field, one naturally has to suffer various kinds of torments. Cutting the body with a saw, cooking in a cauldron, embracing a Śalmali tree with sharp thorns, swimming in the Vaitaraṇī river, etc., are great sufferings. Even in human life, there are many sufferings such as poverty, disease, illness, dependence, killing, bondage, etc. Even in the state of gods, there are sufferings such as envy, sorrow, burning with jealousy upon seeing the wealth of others, death, six months of suffering, etc. Thus, the cycle of worldly existence is full of suffering; contemplate on this sorrowful situation and consider how all the beings entangled in the illusions of the world can attain liberation by being free from all sufferings such as birth and death. After waking up, contemplate in this way. 309. Even in contact with obstacles, those who are steadfast in their vows are blessed. Such are Kamadeva and others, praised even by the Tirthankaras. ||138||
Meaning: Even when confronted with obstacles created by gods, humans, and animals, etc., those who are steadfast in the protection and observance of their vows, such as Śrīkamadeva and others, are blessed. The Tirthankara Bhagwan Mahāvīra himself praised them; contemplate in this way. ||138||
The traditional story of the Śrāvaka Kamadeva is as follows:
Steadfast in the face of obstacles: The Śrāvaka Kamadeva
On the banks of the Ganges River, there was a beautiful city named Campa, adorned with rows of bent bamboos and auspicious flags. In this city, King Jitasatru, with arms as long as a serpent's body, ruled, his kingdom as prosperous as the house of Lakshmi. In this same city, there lived a householder named Kamadeva, a wise man who provided shelter to many people, like a large shady tree standing on the road. His wife, named Bhadra, was beautiful and graceful, adorned with beauty and charm, like Lakshmi herself. Kamadeva had six crore gold coins buried safely in the ground; the same amount was invested in trade, and the same amount was invested in household goods and other things. He had six cowherds, each with a family of ten thousand cows.
Once, while wandering through various regions, Bhagwan Mahāvīra arrived there. He sat in the garden called Pūrṇabhadra, which was a beautiful adornment to the earth, outside the city. When Kamadeva heard this, he also went to the feet of the Lord and listened to his sweet and auspicious Dharma teachings. After that, Kamadeva, with a pure mind, accepted the householder Dharma with its twelve vows from the universally revered Bhagwan Mahāvīra. Kamadeva renounced all other women except Bhadra. He renounced all the other cowherds besides the six, and all the other treasures, trade, and household arrangements, keeping only six crore gold coins for each. He kept five hundred fields in the land for farming, with five hundred ploughs. He kept the same number of carts and wagons for bringing goods from foreign lands, and kept four carriages for travel, keeping them within the limits of the vows. He renounced all other carriages. He kept one fragrant saffron cloth for wiping his body, and renounced all others. He kept a tooth-brush made of green licorice root, and renounced all other kinds of tooth-brushes. He renounced all fruits except milk and amalaka. He renounced the use of oils except for massage with sahasrapāka or śatpāka. He renounced all other ubtans except for the fragrant clay ubtan to be applied to the body. He renounced the use of more than eight pitchers of water for bathing. He renounced all other pastes except for the paste of sandalwood and agarwood, and all other flowers except for garlands of flowers and lotuses. He renounced all ornaments except for earrings and a ring with his name on it. He renounced all other incense except for dasāng and agarbatti incense. He kept ghevar and khaja, and renounced all other sweets. He kept kaṣṭhapeya (guḍrab) prepared by boiling with pipparamūla, etc., and renounced all other drinks. He kept kalmi rice, and renounced all other rice. He kept uḍad, mung, and matar, and renounced all other dals (soups). He kept ghee made from cows that had calved in the autumn, and renounced all other oily substances. He kept swastika, mandaka, and palak vegetables, and renounced all other vegetables. He renounced all water except for rainwater, and all tambūl except for fragrant tambūl. In this way, taking vows, Kamadeva bowed to the Lord and returned home. When his wife Bhadra also heard about the

The devotee Kamadeva, who had passed the rigorous test by the gods, 
Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 138 | When he heard about his husband's vow taking, he also went to the Tirthankara Mahavira and accepted the twelve vows of a Shravak. | After that, handing over the burden of the family to his eldest son, Kamadeva himself started to observe the vows diligently in the dispensary. | One day Kamadeva was absorbed in Kaussagg (meditation). Then, at night, to distract him, a Mithyadrishti deva | came there in the form of a terrifying Pisach. The hair on his head appeared yellow and like ripe paddy in the field | they were. His skull was like a skull, his eyebrows like a mongoose's tail, and his ears were shaped like a ladle. His nose and both lips looked like a camel's, and his teeth were exactly like a plough tail. His two eyes were like two hot yellow pots | they were. His tongue was like a snake's and his mustache was like a horse's | was shining. The lower part of his lips was like a lion's. His chin was like the mouth of a plough. Neck | long like a camel's and chest wide like the gate of a city. His deep belly was like the netherworld and his navel was like a well | was. His male organ was like a python. His two testicles were like leather bottles. He had two long thighs like a palm tree, two feet like a mountain rock. Suddenly, his voice was like the thunder of lightning, terrifying and harsh. He had a mongoose in his ears instead of ornaments; he had a rat's | garlands on his head and turtle garlands around his neck. He was wearing a serpent in place of an armband. He suddenly became angry, drew his sword from its sheath, and raised his terrifying forefinger like a whip, roaring at Kamadeva | and said thus - Oh, you rogue! Desiring an unwanted thing! What kind of pretense have you made? Poor fellow like you | a proud man wants heaven or liberation? Give it up, this work. Otherwise, like fruits fall from a tree; so I will cut off your head with this sharp | sword and drop it on the ground. Hearing the terrifying, laughter-filled, threatening | roar, Kamadeva did not move even a little from his samadhi. Has the octopus ever been disturbed by the sound of the buffalo? When the Shravak Kamadeva did not move even a little from his auspicious meditation, the Adhamdeva repeated the same things two or three times. | He threatened again and again, but when he did not get distracted, he played another trick, | taking the form of a drunken elephant. It is true that wicked people do not refrain from doing evil deeds without weighing their strength. | come. He assumed such a huge and terrifying elephant body that it was very | high, like a black, moist cloud; as if the heap of falsehood had shrunk and gathered in one place. His terrifying, long, two tusks looked like Yama's mace. Raising his trunk high like a noose of death, he said to Kamadeva | Oh, you magician! Give up this illusion and come to my shelter! Live happily in my command. Some hypocritical guru has misled you into this delusion. If you still don't give up this pretense of religion, then watch, I will pick you up with this trunk-shaped club and throw you high in the sky, and when you start falling back from the sky, I will pierce you on this tusk, so that your body will pierce through the tusk. Then I will tear you apart like wood; like a potter kneads clay, I will trample your body with my feet; so that your tragic death | will happen. Even then, if you don't die, I will grind you in a sesame-sized mill and make your body into one lump in a moment. The mad | deva spoke such terrifying words, but the meditating Shravak Kamadeva did not give any reply. Seeing Kamadeva steadfast in meditation, the wicked deva repeated the same things two or three times again in the same way, | but when he did not move, he picked him up with his trunk and threw him high in the sky, then caught him like a blade of grass as he fell back and pierced him with his tusk. After that, he crushed him with his feet. What evil deeds do not the enemies of religious deeds do? But the great being Kamadeva endured all this patiently. He was like a mountain | unmoved. He did not lose his steadiness even a little. Even when such calamities befell him, he did not get distracted from his meditation, then the arrogant Adhamdeva took the form of a snake. And as before, he tried to frighten Kamadeva again. But the patient man was absorbed in his meditation. He did not get scared, he did not waver. His words were ineffective and futile

## Description of the 6 Aspirations of a Shravak

Seeing the description of the 6 aspirations of a Shravak in the third light of Yogashastra, verses 139 to 141, and seeing Kamadeva as even more fearless and strong, the serpentine, low-born deva, like leather being stretched on a drum, wrapped himself around Kamadeva's entire body in the form of a serpent and bit him mercilessly with sharp teeth, very forcefully. Yet, Kamadeva, absorbed in his meditation nectar, did not care for this pain. Afterwards, defeated and exhausted from all sides, the deva assumed his true divine form. Then, illuminating all four directions, he entered the dispensary and, with folded hands, humbly said to Kamadeva: "Blessings upon you, Kamadeva. When Indra praised you in the assembly of the devas, I could not bear it. Therefore, I came here to test you. Because sometimes, even masters, in their pride of ownership, present the truth in a distorted way. For this reason, I had taken various forms and tested you in various ways. But I must say that you are as patient, brave, fearless, and steadfast in Dharma as Indra Maharaj had praised you to be. I troubled you greatly while testing you; for that, I seek forgiveness for my offenses." Thus, after repeatedly pleading with Kamadeva, the deva returned to his place. The unwavering Kamadeva also completed his Kayotsarga.

The Srivirprabu, overflowing with natural affection for virtues, praised Kamadeva Shravak in his Samvasaran (Dharma Sabha) for his equanimity in facing the obstacles and his steadfastness in his vows. The next day, Shravak Kamadeva came to pay homage at the lotus feet of Tribhvan-Swami Srivirprabu, then the Lord said to Gautam and other munis: "Ayushman Shramanos! If Kamadeva, while engaged in the duties of a householder, faced such terrible obstacles with equanimity and fearlessness, then you, the renunciants, who are devoted to the path of Sadhudharma and have renounced all attachments, should especially endure such obstacles. In the declining years of his life, Kamadeva Shravak, in order to purify his karmas, worshipped the eleven images of a Shravak, which are the means to achieve this. In his final moments, he performed Sanlekhana, embraced the vow of Anashan, and attained death with supreme Samadhi. He became a deva in the Arunabha Vimana, with a lifespan of four Palyopama. From there, after completing his lifespan, he will be born in the Mahavidehakshetra and attain Siddhahood. Just as Kamadeva Shravak, even in the face of the crisis of obstacles, remained steadfast in his vow-keeping and exhibited natural patience, which was praised by the Tirthankara Bhagwan, so too should noble souls remain steadfast in their vow-keeping with patience. This was the life of Kamadeva, a steadfast follower of Dharma! ||138||

After abandoning sleep, a Dharma-atma Shravak should think in this way. 310. "Jino Devaha Kripa Dharmo, Guruvo Yatra Sadhavaha. Shravakatvaya Kastasmai, Na Shlaghyayet Vimudhadhi?" ||139|| Meaning: In which Shravak Dharma are the Devas, the ideal conquerors of enemies like raga, etc., the Dharma-preaching, restrained Sadhu Gurus, who are devoted to the five great vows, and the compassionate Dharma, which desires to remove the suffering of the suffering, then who would be so foolish as to not praise this Shravakatva (Shravak Dharma)? He will surely praise it. Special Meaning: But Devas who are attached to raga, etc., are not worthy of worship for a Shravak; Dharma in the form of violent yajnas, etc., is not Dharma; and Sadhu Gurus who are engrossed in arnabha-parigraha, etc., are not true Gurus. ||139|| Now, after abandoning sleep, the aspirations of a Shravak, in the form of thoughts, are presented in seven verses. 311. "Jindharmavinirmukto, Ma Bhuvam Chakravartyapi. Syam Cheto'pi Daridro'pi, Jindharmaadhivasitaha." ||140|| Meaning: I do not desire to become a Chakravarti even, being devoid of (deprived of) Jain Dharma, in the form of knowledge, darshan, and charitra; because without Dharma, that position leads to hell. But I accept being poor or a slave in a family that is well-cultured in Jain Dharma, because there, attaining Dharma is easy. ||140|| ||312. "Tyaktasango Jirnavasa, Malaklinnakalevaraha. Bhajan Madhukari Vrutti, Munichaan Kada Shraye?" ||141|| Meaning: When will that auspicious, auspicious day come for me, when I, having renounced attachment to all external objects, with worn-out clothes, and a body soiled with impurities, will embrace the life of a Madhukari (bee), and when will I take refuge in the Munis? ||141||

## The Aspirations of a Shravak

**Verse 142-145 from the Third Light of Yoga Shastra**

**Verse 141:**

When will I, clothed in worn-out garments, with a soiled body, embrace the path of a Muni, taking refuge in Madhukari (begging for alms)?

**Explanation:**

Madhukari refers to the way a bee collects nectar from flowers planted by others, without causing any harm to the flowers, and thus satisfies its own needs. Similarly, a monk, without causing any harm, accepts food prepared by householders, with a sense of gratitude and devotion, and thus satisfies his needs. In this world, one who is free from external and internal possessions is called a Shraman. Just as a bee naturally collects pollen from blooming flowers, a Sadhu naturally accepts a small amount of food to sustain his body and continue his journey of self-control. The comparison to a bee highlights that the alms received by a Muni do not cause any harm to other beings. This is called Madhukari Vriti.

**Conclusion:**

A Shravak should aspire to live a life of Madhukari Vriti and thus partake in the Muni-charya, which is the path of the Muni, characterized by the fundamental and advanced virtues.

**Verse 142:**

Abandoning the company of those with bad character, touching the dust of the Guru's feet, when will I, practicing the three yogas, become capable of ending the cycle of birth and death?

**Meaning:**

The company of those with bad character includes those who are immoral in the worldly sense, such as adulterers, actors, singers, and prostitutes, as well as those who are immoral in the spiritual sense, such as those who are arrogant, lazy, deceitful, attached, and self-indulgent. By abandoning the company of such people and touching the dust of the Guru's feet, one should practice the three yogas of knowledge, vision, and conduct, and thus become capable of ending the cycle of birth and death.

**Verse 143:**

When will I, in the dead of night, outside the city, in a beautiful natural place, be absorbed in Kayotsarga, and when will bulls mistake me for a pillar and rub their shoulders against me?

**Meaning:**

A Shravak who practices Kayotsarga should aspire to be absorbed in it, outside the city, in a beautiful natural place, in the dead of night, to the extent that bulls mistake him for a pillar and rub their shoulders against him.

**Implication:**

A Sadhu who practices Kayotsarga is always absorbed in it. A Shravak should aspire to achieve such absorption.

**Verse 144:**

When will I, sitting in Padmasana in the forest, with a fawn nestled in my lap, be able to have the old leaders of the herd of deer sniff my face with trust?

**Meaning:**

When will I, sitting in Padmasana in the forest, with a fawn nestled in my lap, be able to have the old leaders of the herd of deer sniff my face with trust?

**Implication:**

Old deer are not easily trusting of humans. But when they see the unwavering stillness of a person in deep Samadhi, they become so trusting that they can lick or sniff their face without fear.

**Verse 145:**

When will I be able to have the same attitude towards enemies and friends, grass and women, gold and stone, gems and dirt, liberation and the world?

**Meaning:**

When will I be able to have the same attitude towards enemies and friends, grass and women, gold and stone, gems and dirt, liberation and the world?

**Explanation:**

One may find people who have the same attitude towards enemies and friends, grass and women, gold and stone, gems and dirt, but a truly detached soul is one who sees no difference between liberation, which is the state of being free from karma, and the world, which is the state of being bound by karma.

## The Eleven Images of a Shravak

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verses 146-147**

It is said, "In liberation and in existence, the best Muni is devoid of attachment everywhere."  This means that the best Muni is one who is completely detached from liberation and existence. In this way, the aspirations of a Shravak gradually increase. 

The first verse describes the aspiration for attachment to Jain Dharma, the second verse describes the aspiration to accept the conduct of the Sadhus, the third verse describes the aspiration to attain excellent character along with the practice of Sadhu Dharma, the fourth verse describes the aspiration to attain the state of non-attachment, including Kayotsarga, the fifth verse describes the aspiration to become trustworthy to all beings, and the sixth verse describes the aspiration to reach the state of Paramasamayik. 

**Verse 146**

**Meaning:** To ascend the ladder of qualities (Gunasthanas) leading to the palace of liberation, one should aspire for the above-mentioned aspirations, which are like the roots of a vine of supreme bliss.

**Meaning:** Just as a vine grows from its roots, so too does the supreme bliss of Paramasamayik manifest from these aspirations. Therefore, one should contemplate these seven verses and their aspirations.

**Verse 147**

**Meaning:** A Shravak who diligently follows the Shravak conduct throughout the day and night, and who practices the eleven images of a Shravak as described in the scriptures, even while being a householder, becomes purified by the destruction of his sins.

**What are these images?**

The practice of these images purifies even a householder Shravak. These are called the Eleven Images of a Shravak:

**Image** refers to a specific vow of practice, in which the Shravak, with determination, diligently follows the Yamas and Niyamas that they have accepted. There are eleven images for a Shravak:

1. **Darshan-Pratima:**  For one month, continuously and without deviation, one should practice pure Samyagdarshan, free from doubts and other defects, adorned with qualities like calmness, and embellished with virtues like stability. This should be done without fear, greed, shame, or other obstacles.

2. **Vrat-Pratima:** For two months, continuously and without deviation, one should practice the twelve vows, along with the practice of the previous image.

## Sanlekhana: Characteristics, Location, Method and Excesses

**From Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verses 148-149**

**Verse 148:**

* **Meaning:** When a Shravak sees that their body is becoming incapable of performing the necessary practices of restraint (religious activities) or when the time of death is approaching, they should first accept restraint and then perform Sanlekhana.
* **Explanation:** Sanlekhana means to renounce food and anger, etc., to make the body and the passions thin. First, one must perform **Sharira Sanlekhana**, which means gradually reducing food intake to make the body thin. If one does not perform Sharira Sanlekhana, then the body will naturally become agitated, and the soul will experience a painful death. (Pancha Vastu 1507)
* **Second, there is **Kshaya Sanlekhana**, which means to reduce the passions of anger, pride, deceit, greed, delusion, envy, hatred, lust, etc., along with the body. If one does not do this, then they will be like the Sanlekhana-performing Sadhu who was told by his Guru, "I do not praise your austerities that have made your body thin. I am concerned about how your finger has broken. Think about that." Therefore, one should perform **Bhaava Sanlekhana**. Do not be in a hurry to perform Anashan (Santhara).
* **The Shravak performing Sanlekhana should also accept restraint as appropriate. Their conduct should be understood as follows:** A Shravak who knows all the duties of a Shravak should accept restraint in the end. Such a Shravak should also accept the remaining **Dharma Swaroop Sanlekhana** in the Dharma of restraint. It is said, "**Sanlehana u ante na nioa jen pavvaai koi.**" One who accepts restraint in the end should perform Sanlekhana after accepting restraint and then accept death with joy and peace. One who does not accept restraint after Sanlekhana will attain a peaceful death like an Anand Shravak. (Verse 148)

**Verse 149:**

* **Meaning:** To perform Sanlekhana, one should go to the holy pilgrimage sites where the Arihant Bhagavants were born, initiated, attained Kevalgyan, or attained Nirvana. If the Kalyanak Bhoomi is not nearby, then one should perform Sanlekhana in a secluded house, home, forest, or a quiet, peaceful place free from living beings.
* **Explanation:** The Kalyanak Bhoomi are the places where the Arihant Tirthankara Prabhus were born, initiated, attained Kevalgyan, and attained Nirvana. 

**Note:** The text continues with further explanation and details about Sanlekhana.

Sanlekhana, in the form of Pariṣaha, is described in the third light of Yogaśāstra, verses 150 to 152. If a Sanlekhanadharak reaches such a place of auspiciousness, then one should know where the birthplaces of the Tirthankaras are. The birth-kalyaṇaka-bhūmis of the 24 Tirthankaras, starting with Ṛṣabhadev, are as follows: 1. Ikṣvākubhūmi, 2. Ayodhyā, 3. Śrāvastī, 4. Vinītā, 5. Kauśalapur, 6. Kauśāmbī, 7. Vārāṇasī, 8. Candrānana (Candrapurī), 9. Kākandi, 10. Bhaḍilpur, 11. Siṃhapur, 12. Campapūrī, 13. Kampilā, 14. Ayodhyā, 15. Ratnapūr, 16-17-18. Gajapur-Hastināpur, 19. Mithilā, 20. Rājagṛha, 21. Mithilā, 22. Śorīpur, 23. Vārāṇasī, 24. Kuṇḍapur (Ā. Ni. 382-384). Their dīkṣā-kalyaṇaka-bhūmis are as follows: Śrī Bhagavān Ṛṣabhadev's dīkṣā was in Vinītā nagarī, Bhagavān Ariṣṭanemi's in Dvāravati-Dvārīkā, and the remaining twenty-two Tirthankaras received their dīkṣā in their respective birthplaces. Śrī Ṛṣabhadev Bhagavān received dīkṣā in Siddārthavan, Vāsupūjya Bhagavān in Bihāragṛha, Dharmanāth Bhagavān in Vaprāgā, Muniśuvratasvāmī in Nīl Gufā, Pārśvanāth Bhagavān in Āśramapad, Mahāvīra Prabhu in Jñātrikhaṇḍa, and the remaining Tirthankaras in Sahasāmravan Udyān. (Ā. Ni. 229 to 231). The places of attainment of Kevalajñāna-kalyaṇaka-bhūmis are as follows: Śrī Ṛṣabhadev Bhagavān attained Kevalajñāna in Purimatāl, Śrī Mahāvīra Bhagavān on the banks of the Ṛijubālukā river, and the remaining Tirthankaras attained Kevalajñāna near the same place where they had received dīkṣā. (Ā. Ni. 254). The places of Nirvāṇa-kalyaṇaka-bhūmis are as follows: Śrī Ṛṣabhadev Bhagavān attained Nirvāṇa on Aṣṭāpad Parvat, Vāsupūjya Bhagavān in Campapūrī, Nemināth Bhagavān on Śrīraivatagiri, and Bhagavān Mahāvīra in Pāvāpurī. The remaining twenty Tirthankaras attained Nirvāṇa on Sammedśikhar. (Ā. Ni. 307). One should accept the final rite of death in the form of marana in one of these kalyaṇaka-bhūmis. If the place of kalyaṇaka, such as birth, dīkṣā, Kevalajñāna, and Nirvāṇa, is not found or is not nearby, or if it is not possible to reach there at the time of death, then one should perform Sanlekhanā in a quiet and secluded place, after cleaning and marking the ground in one's home, in the place of the sadhus - upāśraya, in the forest, or in a Siddha-kṣetra like Śajaya, etc., by looking at a place free from living beings. One should also clean and mark a place free from living beings in the kalyaṇaka-bhūmis, etc. ||149|| ||321||  
Having abandoned the four types of food, one should be devoted to namaskāra. Having performed the worship of the four refuges, one should take refuge in them. ||150||
Meaning: First of all, one should abandon the four types of food - aśana, pāna, khādima, and svādima - and be devoted to the remembrance of the great mantra of Paramesṭhi-namaskāra. Then, one should worship knowledge, etc., without any transgression, and take refuge in the four refuges - Arihant, Siddha, Sadhu, and Dharma. Or, one should dedicate one's soul to the four revered principles and say in a loud voice: "Arihante saraṇam pavajjāmī, Sidde saraṇam pavajjāmī, Sāhu saraṇam pavajjāmī, Kevalipannatam Dhammam saraṇam pavajjāmī." That is, I take refuge in Arihant Bhagavān, I take refuge in Siddha Paramātmā, I take refuge in Sadhu Bhagavants, and I take refuge in the Dharma spoken by the Kevalajñānī Tirthankaras. ||150|| ||322||
In this world and the next, in life and death, one should abandon the five transgressions and be immersed in the nectar of samadhi. ||151||
Meaning: One should abandon the five transgressions of Sanlekhanā, which are motivated by: 1. worldly desires, 2. desires for the next world, 3. desire for life, 4. desire for death, and 5. desire for sensual pleasures. ||151||
Explanation: One should accept lifelong fasting with the five transgressions. The five transgressions are: 1. After fasting, having desires for this world, such as attachment to form, wealth, worship, and fame, etc., 2. After performing Sanlekhanā (fasting), having desires for the next world, such as wealth and prosperity in the devlok, etc., and for devanganas, etc., 3. Having a desire to live longer. Seeing that one's worship and praise are increasing, or seeing many people coming and going to see one, or hearing praise from everyone, the fasting sadhak may think, "It would be good if I lived longer!" 4. After abandoning the four types of food, having a desire for pomp and show, like that of a certain celestial sadhak, etc.

To desire death (prāṇatyāga) with the thought, "I will perform Sanlekhanā"; or, if someone has undertaken a fast but their body becomes severely ill, or they experience intense pain, or they are subjected to disrespect (lack of honor, worship, praise, etc.), and they desire to die quickly, this is called maraṇāśaṁsā. And 5. The meaning of nidāna is: "I have performed difficult tapas or observed some vow-rule, and in return for the fruits of those tapas, etc., I will be born in the next life as a Cakravartī, Vāsudeva, king, emperor, fortunate or beautiful human being, or god." One should abandon such nidāna (duṣaṁkalpa). Again, how? It is said: "He should be irrigated by the nectar of samādhi, the supreme state of well-being," i.e., he should be absorbed in samādhi. ||151|| ||323||

**Pariṣahopasargebhyo, nirbhīko jinabhaktibhāk |**
**Pratipadyet maraṇānandaḥ śrāvako yathā ||152||**

**Meaning:** Even if Pariṣahas and upsargas arise, one should not be afraid, but remain absorbed in the devotion of Jineśvara Bhagavān, and attain samādhi-death like a joyful śrāvaka. ||152||

**Explanation:** One should endure Pariṣahas (endurable for the protection of one's dharma) and upsargas for the purification of karma. ||152||

One should not be frightened or disturbed by the Pariṣahas (difficulties) that arise while observing dharma. There are twenty-two Pariṣahas. They are as follows: 1. Kṣudhāpariṣaha, 2. Tṛṣṇā, 3. Śīta, 4. Uṣṇa, 5. Daṁśa-maśaka, 6. Acelakatva, 7. Arati, 8. Strī, 9. Carya, 10. Niṣadyā, 11. Śayyā, 12. Ākrośa, 13. Vadh, 14. Yācanā, 15. Alābha, 16. Roga, 17. Tṛṇa-sparśa, 18. Mala, 19. Satkāra, 20. Prajñā, 21. Ajñāna, and 22. Darśana-pariṣaha. It is essential for Sanlekhanāvrati and Mahāvratī sādhakas to conquer these twenty-two Pariṣahas.

**Twenty-Two Pariṣahas:**

1. **Kṣudhāpariṣaha:** When afflicted by hunger, a powerful, discerning sādhū should not violate the injunction of going for alms without being compelled by need (without fear), but should go for alms only for the sustenance of their journey of self-control. A Sanlekhanādhārī sādhaka should endure hunger with equanimity.

2. **Tṛṣā-pariṣaha:** When thirsty, a Tattvajñamuni should not desire to drink the water they see in rivers, ponds, wells, etc., along the way, but should abandon humility and seek water without attachment. A Sanlekhanādhārī should also endure thirst with equanimity.

3. **Śīta-pariṣaha:** When afflicted by cold, even if there are no clothes or blankets nearby, one should not accept imagined clothes, etc., nor should they light a fire or warm themselves by the fire to alleviate the cold.

4. **Uṣṇapariṣaha:** Even if the earth is hot, one should not criticize the heat, nor should they desire a fan or bath, etc.

5. **Daṁśamaśakapariṣaha:** When bitten or stung by insects, mosquitoes, bedbugs, etc., one should not harm them, nor should they harbor hatred towards them, but should maintain a sense of impartiality, because every living being is fond of food.

6. **Acelaka-pariṣaha:** If one does not have clothes, or if they have bad clothes, one should not think, "This garment is good, this is bad." One should only consider the difference between gain and loss. But one should not grieve over the lack of clothes.

7. **Araṁti-pariṣaha:** While enjoying the garden of dharma, a sādhū or sādhaka should not experience disinterest or indifference while walking, sitting, standing, or performing acts of self-control, or while observing dharma, but should keep their mind always healthy and cheerful.

8. **Strī-pariṣaha:** A woman who causes distraction, who is beautiful in form, who is stained with karmic impurities, and who is like the threshold of the door to liberation, destroys dharma merely by being remembered. Therefore, one should not even remember her.

9. **Carya-pariṣaha:** A sādhū who lives in villages, cities, towns, etc., in an irregular manner, should perform their daily activities, such as walking, etc., according to the rules, without attachment to any place, even if they are alone, and should acquire various possessions.

10. **Niṣadyā-pariṣaha:** To live in a place like a cremation ground is called niṣadyā-sthāna. In such a place, one should live fearlessly, enduring favorable or unfavorable upsargas, in a place devoid of women, animals, or eunuchs.

11. **Śayyā-pariṣaha:** When one receives a good or bad bed, or experiences pleasure or pain, one should not harbor attachment or aversion in their mind. One should think, "I will have to leave this bed in the morning anyway," and should not experience joy or sorrow.

12. **Ākrośapariṣaha:** One should not become angry with someone who is angry, but should be forgiving and endure with equanimity. For one who is forgiving or who forgives is called a śramaṇa. And one should view the angry person with a benevolent mind.

13. **Vadha-pariṣaha**

The Final Religious Act of an Ananda Shravak
Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verse 152: If a Muni is killed or beaten, at that time he should consider that the soul is never destroyed. Due to the wickedness of anger, karma-bandha (bondage of karma) occurs, and through forgiveness, virtue is acquired; therefore, one should not kill him, but rather endure the killing. 14. Yachana-parishah - A mendicant who lives by begging lives on the things given by others. Therefore, a sadhu-sadhvi should not feel shame or sorrow in begging. He should not desire to accept the life of a householder out of fear of begging. 15. Alaabh-parishah - He should not feel sorrow if food, etc., is not received from others for himself or for others, and he should not feel pride if it is received. If someone has not given food, etc., he should not slander that person or village. 16. Rog-parishah - If he is sick, he should not be afraid. He should not desire to be treated, but should endure the disease with a submissive mind, understanding the difference between the body and the soul. 17. Trina-sparsha-parishah - If a bed of straw, grass, etc., is spread, or if the cloth is very fine, and its points prick and cause pain, he should endure it; but he should not desire a soft, ticklish bed. 18. Mal-parishah - If dirt has accumulated all over the body due to sun or sweat, and there is a bad smell, the Muni should not be disturbed. He should not desire to bathe by immersing himself in water or by swimming, nor should he desire to rub away the dirt. 19. Satkar-parishah - A sadhu should not expect respect, worship, charity, honor, prestige, or applause from anyone. If he does not receive respect, he should not feel humility, inferiority, or anger in his mind. If he receives respect, he should not feel joy or pride. 20. Prajna-parishah - If he sees another as more intelligent and knows his own limited intelligence, he should not feel regret in his mind, and if he has more intelligence himself, he should not be proud of it; nor should he be unhappy in giving knowledge to others. 21. Agyan-parishah - Even though he is knowledgeable and virtuous, he should endure the ignorance that "I am a chham-sth (one who is in the state of being bound by karma)", and he should think in his mind that knowledge is acquired gradually through the gradual destruction of karma. 22. Darshan-parishah - Even after attaining samyaktva (right faith), he should not feel sorrow if he does not understand the true nature of things in their true form. He should not be proud of having attained samyag-darshan (right vision) and should believe that the Jineshwara Bhagwan-stated jiva, ajav, dharma, adharma, rebirth, etc., are true even though they are indirect.
In this way, the Muni, who is fearless, a conqueror of the senses, and who has control over his mind, speech, and body, should endure physical, mental, or natural parishahs with equanimity. Pariṣahs occur due to the arising of jnana-avareniya, vedaniya, mohaniya, and antaraya karmas. Due to vedaniya karma, 1. hunger, 2. thirst, 3. cold, 4. heat, 5. bite, 6. movement, 7. killing, 8. excrement, 9. bed, 10. disease, 11. trina-sparsha can happen even to a Jin-kevali. Even when upsarga comes, they remain fearless. Up means near, the one who causes suffering is called upsarga, or the one who is troubled is called upsarga. It is of four types: 1. Devakrit, 2. Due to hatred, 3. For the purpose of examination, and 4. Each of these four has four divisions: 1. Due to laughter, 2. Manukrit, 3. Tithanch-krit, and 4. Swatah-krit. Due to the combination of all these, it is mixed. This (fourth type of) upsarga is caused by the gods. Human-related upsarga occurs due to laughter, hatred, examination, and bad character. Tithanch-related upsarga occurs due to fear, anger, food, or protection of the family. He kills, throws down, or stops due to these reasons. Pain in the body or due to vata-pitta, kapha, and sannipat also cause upsarga. In this way, the devotee who endures parishahs and upsargas with equanimity is devoted to Jineshwara Bhagwan. It is said that - Shri Jineshwara Deva, who has crossed the ocean of the world, has also performed the final sanlekhana arādhana (samadhi-maran-sadhana). Knowing this, everyone should worship him with respect and devotion. It is also said - The first Tirthankara Shri Rishabhdeva accepted the final act of the body in the form of nirvana as a six-day fast. In this way, the devotee should accept samadhi-maran like the Ananda Shravak.
The story of the Ananda Shravak, as it is passed down in the tradition of the sect, is as follows:
The Final Religious Act of an Ananda Shravak:
In those days, Vanijyak was a famous city, prosperous and rich, surpassing other cities in trade. There, the people lived according to the law.

The Story of Anand Shravak

In the third light of the Yoga Shastra, verse 152, there was a famous king named Jitashatru, who was like a father to his people. In that city, there lived a householder named Anand, whose very presence brought joy to the eyes of others, as if another moon had come to earth. Just as Rohini is considered the wife of the moon, so too was his wife, Shivananda, beautiful in form and grace. He possessed four crore gold coins, buried in the ground as treasure and invested in trade and household goods. He also had four large herds of cows. In the northwest corner of the city, in a suburb called Kollak, Anand had many relatives. At that time, Siddhartha Nandan, Shri Vardhaman Swami, was wandering the earth and arrived in the city's Dyutipalash garden. When King Jitashatru heard of the Lord's arrival, he too went with his family to pay his respects to the Lord. Anand also walked, taking many people with him, and reached the Lord's lotus feet. He purified his ears by listening to the Lord's nectar-like Dharmadeshana. Then, bowing at the Lord's feet, the great Anand accepted the twelve vows of householder Dharma from the Lord. He renounced all other women except his wife Shivananda. He renounced all other wealth, including the four crore gold coins buried as treasure, invested in trade, and used in household goods. He renounced all other land, including the four herds of cows and the land cultivated by five hundred ploughs. He renounced all other vehicles except the four chariots used for trade in all directions (Digyatra). He renounced all other clothes except the fragrant saffron cloth (towel) used for wiping his body. He renounced all other toothpastes except the green licorice root and all other fruits except the sour amla. He renounced all other oil massages except the Sahasrapak and Shatapak oils. He renounced all other fragrant ointments except the fragrant ointment suitable for application. He renounced using more than eight pots of water for bathing. He renounced wearing more than one pair of cotton clothes. He renounced all other ointments except the application of sandalwood, agarwood, and saffron. He renounced all other flowers except the garland of Malati flowers and the lotus. He renounced all other ornaments except the ear ornaments and the ring. He renounced all other incense except the Dashaang incense and the agarwood incense. He renounced all other sweets except Ghevar and Pua. He renounced all other drinks except the drink made from wood (Rab) and the rice cooked in a pot (Kalmi Chawal). He renounced all other soups (Dals) except the soups made from black gram, green gram, and peas. He renounced all other ghee except the ghee made from cow's milk in the autumn season. He renounced all other vegetables except the Swastik, Manduki, and other vegetables. He renounced all other dals except the sour dal (Kadhi) prepared with ghee and oil. He renounced all other water except rainwater. He renounced all other mouth fresheners except the five fragrant tambools.

After this, Anand bowed to the Lord and returned home. He happily told Shivananda about the method of the accepted householder Dharma. Hearing this, Shivananda, who desired to accept householder Dharma for her own well-being, also got into a chariot and went to the Lord's feet at that very moment. She bowed to the Guru of the three worlds and, understanding well, accepted Shravak Dharma. She was delighted to hear the Lord's nectar-like words and returned home in a Dharma chariot as bright as a plane. At that time, Shri Gautam Swami asked the omniscient Lord, "Will this great soul, Anand Shravak, accept the Sadhu Dharma?" The omniscient Lord, who sees all three times, said, "Anand will follow the vows of a Shravak for a long time. After that, he will complete his lifespan and become a great god in the Arun Prabha Vimana of the first heaven, Saudharma Kalpa, with a state of four Palyopama."

Fourteen years passed as Anand Shravak diligently followed the twelve vows. One night, in the last watch, the pure, wise Anand thought, "I am the foundation of many people in this city. If I fall while worrying about them, then the Dharma accepted by me, as declared by the omniscient, will be tainted with the faults of transgression, etc." Thinking in this way, with good intentions in his mind, Anand Shravak got up in the morning. As per his resolve, he had a very large dispensary built in the Kollak settlement. There, he invited his friends, relatives, and kin...

A householder, a protector of the Shravak Dharma, invited the author of the Yoga Shastra, the Third Light, to his home and offered him food. Then, in front of everyone, he entrusted all the responsibilities of his family to his eldest son. After paying respects to his friends, relatives, and family members and seeking their permission, he went to the dispensary with the desire to engage in religious activities. There, following the teachings of the great soul, Anand Bhagwan, he began to practice Dharma with the same dedication as he would for his own soul, striving to overcome the karmas arising from passions and to nourish his body. He ascended the eleven stages of a Shravak, like a person climbing a mountain, aiming for heaven and liberation. This great soul, through intense austerities, dried up his blood and flesh, leaving his body looking like a piece of wood wrapped in leather. One night, Anand, the Shravak, was awake, engaged in Dharma and finding joy in his constant austerities. He thought to himself, "As long as I have the strength to stand, as long as I am able to call others, and as long as my Dharma teachers are here, I will accept both types of fatal Sanlekhanas, renounce all four types of food, and fast until death." Having made this decision, Anand the Shravak carried it out. The thoughts and actions of great souls never waver. Anand, with equanimity and detachment towards life and death, attained Avadhi knowledge through the destruction of the Avadhijnana Avaraniya karma.

Meanwhile, the glorious Lord Vira, while traveling, arrived at the Dyutipalash garden. After his Dharma discourse was completed, Shri Gautam Ganadhar entered the city to beg for alms. While begging, he came across Anand, the Shravak, adorned in a beautiful Kollarak garment, and accepted food and water from him. The people were astonished at the arrival of Gautam Swami. They gathered on the road and told Gautam Swami, "Anand, the virtuous Shravak disciple of the glorious Lord Vira, has undertaken a fast unto death. He has no desire for any worldly pleasures." Hearing this, Gautam Swami thought, "I should go and see this Shravak." With this thought, he went to his dispensary. Anand, the Shravak, was overjoyed at the unexpected sight of Gautam Swami, like a shower of precious jewels. He bowed down and said, "O Bhagwan! I am unable to stand due to the difficult fast I am undertaking. Please come closer so that I can touch your lotus feet." The great sage Gautam stood near Anand, the Shravak, who then bowed his head at his feet and offered a pure threefold salutation. Then, with confidence, he asked, "O Bhagwan! Can a householder attain Avadhi knowledge?" In response, Gautam Swami said, "Yes, they can." Anand then said, "O Bhagwan! By the grace of my Gurudev, I, a householder, have attained Avadhi knowledge. I can see for a hundred yojanas in all three directions - east, south, and west - and the waters of the oceans, and in the north, I can see the Himalayas. Similarly, O Lord, I can see up to the Saudharma heaven and down to the Loluyachchuy Pathde (a division of hell) in the Ratnaprabaha earth." Hearing this, Gautam Swami said, "Anand! A householder can indeed attain Avadhi knowledge, but not knowledge of such vast subjects. Therefore, you must perform atonement." Anand said, "O Bhagwan! I have this Avadhi knowledge. So, is it atonement to speak the truth about existing things? If it is atonement, O Bhagwan! You should take it upon yourself." When Anand spoke to Gautam Swami in this way, he also had some doubts. He went directly to the glorious Lord Vira, informed him about the food and water, and expressed his doubts about Anand's Avadhi knowledge. He asked the Lord directly, "O Lord! In this matter, is Anand the one who should perform atonement, or am I? Should I be criticized, or should Anand?" The Lord said, "Gautam! You should give him the Miccha Mi Dukkadam and go to Anand and ask for forgiveness." Following the Lord's command, Gautam Swami, the repository of forgiveness, apologized to Anand, the Shravak. In this way, Anand, the Shravak, lived for twenty years, observing the Shravak Dharma, and completed his lifespan through fasting. He became a deva in the celestial vehicle called Arunavar. From there, after completing his lifespan, he will be born in Mahavideha and attain the supreme liberation, Moksha. This is the account of Anand, the Shravak's, death in Samadhi and his successful journey through life.

The future destiny of the Shravak is described in two verses, as follows:

"He attained Indrahood in kalpas, or some other superior position. He rejoices, being endowed with the merit of an unsurpassed kingdom." (153)

The Future Good Fortune of a Householder Who Upholds the Shravaka Dharma

**Yoga Shastra, Third Light, Verses 154-155**

**Verse 154:**

**Meaning:** According to the scriptures, a householder who upholds the Shravaka Dharma attains the Indra position or other excellent positions in the Saudharma and other heavenly realms. Due to his excellent store of merit, he remains happy. From there, he is born into human realms, enjoys various rare pleasures, and then, becoming detached from them, destroys his karma, becomes a pure soul, and attains liberation within the eight existences.

**Explanation:** A householder who truly follows the Shravaka Dharma is born in the Saudharma and other heavenly realms. A person with right faith is not born in the other three heavenly realms. Even in the heavenly realms, he attains the position of Indra, Samanika, Trayastrimsa Parishadya, Lokapala, etc. The word "excellent" means that he is not a slave, a Kilvishika, or a member of any other inferior caste of gods. Wherever he is born, he enjoys the highest happiness and great merit. He has a chariot made of precious jewels, vast gardens, beautiful pools for bathing, exquisite jewels, ornaments, clothes, female attendants, celestial nymphs, and millions of gods who compete with each other to serve him, filling the sky with their shouts of victory. There, he obtains all worldly pleasures simply by wishing for them. He experiences great joy from traveling to various Siddha places. He experiences all these unique and extraordinary pleasures due to the power of his past merit. After completing his lifespan in the Vaimanika heavenly realm, he is born into the human realm, obtaining a distinguished country, caste, wealth, beauty, etc., and takes birth in a noble body. There, he enjoys unparalleled pleasures of sound, form, taste, smell, and touch. In the meantime, he finds an opportunity for detachment and develops a strong aversion to worldly pleasures. He accepts complete renunciation and, in that very life, ascends the ladder of stages, gradually attaining perfect knowledge, eradicating all karma, becoming a pure soul, and attaining liberation. If he does not attain liberation in that life, how many existences does the being take to attain liberation? This is called attaining liberation within the eight existences.

**Verse 155:**

**Meaning and Explanation:** Thus, the nature of yoga, which is the three jewels of knowledge, faith, and conduct, has been described in three lights. How has it been described? It has been described concisely, without contradicting the Jina scriptures. It is difficult to explain in detail for those who are not truly seeking liberation. Therefore, it has been described concisely. Can liberation be attained through any other means besides the three jewels? To resolve this doubt, it is said that liberation cannot be attained if even one of these three is lacking. It is said that even by chance, no one can attain liberation without obtaining the three jewels. One who does not know the principles of the soul and other entities, does not have faith in them, creates new karma, and does not destroy old karma through the power of righteous conduct and meditation, cannot escape the bonds of the world and attain liberation. Therefore, by saying "all," it is affirmed that only through the combined worship of knowledge, faith, and conduct can the soul attain liberation; otherwise, not.

**Thus, the third light of the Adhyatma Upanishad, composed by Acharya Shri Hemchandrasuri, which is also known as Yoga Shastra, is complete, along with its own explanation, in response to the curiosity of King Kumarapala.**

|| Om Arhate Namah || 4. Light

In the first three lights, the three jewels of knowledge, faith, and conduct have been described as the cause of the soul's liberation, in relation to the distinction between dharma and the righteous. Now, in relation to the non-distinction, the oneness of the three jewels of knowledge, faith, and conduct with the soul is being described.

327. The soul itself is vision, knowledge, and conduct, or so it is said of the ascetic. That which is identical with the soul, resides in the body. ||1||

Meaning: Or, the soul of the ascetic (saint) is itself vision, knowledge, and conduct; because the soul, which is the essence of vision, etc., resides in the body. ||1||

Explanation: The word "or" in the original verse is used to indicate a second alternative in relation to the non-distinction. The soul itself is the essence of vision, knowledge, and conduct; vision, etc., are not different from the soul. Connecting the ascetic (muni) with the soul, the soul, which is the essence of vision, knowledge, and conduct, resides in the body of the ascetic. Vision, etc., are not separate from the soul, they are the essence of the soul. From this, it becomes the cause of liberation. If it were different from the soul, it could not be the cause of liberation. Devadatta's knowledge, etc., cannot liberate Yajnadutta. ||1|| They support the non-distinction.

328. The soul knows the soul by itself, this knowledge is not for the ignorant, therefore it is said that by abandoning delusion, the soul knows its own soul by its own soul, that is its conduct, that is its knowledge, and that is its faith-like vision. ||2||

Now they praise self-knowledge.

329. The suffering that arises from ignorance of the soul is destroyed by self-knowledge. Those who are devoid of self-knowledge cannot destroy suffering even by austerity. ||3||

Meaning: The soul suffers due to ignorance of the soul, and that suffering is destroyed only by self-knowledge. Those who are devoid of self-knowledge, even those humans cannot destroy suffering by austerity, etc. ||3||

Explanation: In this world, all kinds of suffering are obtained without self-knowledge. Just as darkness is destroyed by light, so too is suffering destroyed by self-knowledge, which is its opposite. Many people raise doubts about this, saying, "The main cause of the destruction of karma is austerity, not knowledge, therefore it is also said that those who have bound themselves by karma through opposite conduct, who have not performed atonement for such karma, cannot be liberated without experiencing them, or liberation can be attained by destroying karma through austerity." The solution to this is that the ignorant soul cannot cut off suffering by austerity or any other ritual. The soul can only cut off suffering by pure knowledge, austerity without knowledge is of little fruit. It is also said, "An ignorant person destroys as much karma in a hundred years of austerity as a three-fold knowledge-holder destroys in a single breath." (Brihatkalpa Bhashya, verse 1170) From this, it is concluded that one should strive for the soul, which is the essence of the three jewels, by abandoning external objects or objects of the senses. Others say, "The soul is to be heard, contemplated, and meditated upon." (Brihadaranyaka 4/5/6) Self-knowledge is not even slightly different from the soul. But the soul, which is the essence of knowledge, can know itself through its own experience. There is no other self-knowledge than this. Similarly, vision and conduct are not different from the soul. Such a soul, which is the essence of consciousness, is also called by the names of knowledge, etc. Here there is a doubt, "Why is this called self-knowledge, leaving aside other subjects? Knowledge of other subjects is also a form of ignorance, suffering.

## Kashayas: Characteristics, Divisions, and Discussion

This section delves into verses 4 to 7 of the fourth chapter of Yoga Shastra. It addresses the question of whether there is anything other than the soul that is of primary importance. The answer is that the soul is the primary entity in all matters. Due to karma, the soul experiences suffering while inhabiting a body. When karma is destroyed, the soul attains its true nature and becomes blissful.

**Verse 4:**

The soul is truly the essence of consciousness and knowledge, as the characteristic of a living being is its ability to use. The body is formed due to the combination of karma, but this is not the case with other objects. Therefore, there is no need to gain knowledge of other objects. When the soul, through the fire of pure meditation, burns away all the fuel of karma and becomes free from the body, it becomes the liberated, pure, and unblemished Siddhatma.

**Verse 5:**

This soul, bound by kashayas and senses, is the cycle of birth and death, encompassing hell, animal life, human life, and heavenly realms. When this same soul conquers kashayas and senses, wise men call it liberation.

**Explanation:**

There is no liberation other than attaining one's true nature. The soul, which is the essence of bliss, attains its own nature. Therefore, one should practice self-knowledge. Right perception and conduct are also attained through this. In this verse, the soul is described as the conqueror of kashayas and senses.

**Verse 6:**

Anger, pride, deceit, and greed are the four kashayas that reside in the embodied soul. Each of these kashayas has four sub-categories, such as Sanjwalana (intense), Pratyakhyanavaran (hindering), Apratyakhyanavaran (partially hindering), and Anantanubandhi (infinitely binding).

**Explanation:**

Anger, pride, deceit, and greed are called kashayas. Alternatively, anything that causes harm to living beings is called a kashayas. "Kash" means "samsara" (cycle of birth and death) or "karma," and "ay" means "to be present." Kashayas cause repeated cycles of birth and death. Kashayas are present only in embodied, worldly beings, not in liberated souls. The four types of kashayas, anger, pride, deceit, and greed, are further divided into four sub-categories based on their intensity and duration. For example, anger has four sub-categories: Sanjwalana (intense), Pratyakhyanavaran (hindering), Apratyakhyanavaran (partially hindering), and Anantanubandhi (infinitely binding). Similarly, there are four sub-categories for pride, deceit, and greed.

**Verse 7:**

Sanjwalana (intense) anger, pride, deceit, and greed last for fifteen days. Sanjwalana kashayas burn like a grass fire, for a short time. Or, they burn due to the presence of factors like anger, pride, deceit, and greed. Pratyakhyanavaran (hindering) kashayas last for four months. It is called "Pratyakhyan" for brevity. Pratyakhyanavaran kashayas hinder the practice of all restraints (niyamas). Apratyakhyanavaran (partially hindering) kashayas last for a year. The word "nab" in this term signifies "less," so it means "that which partially hinders the practice of restraints." Anantanubandhi (infinitely binding) kashayas, which are associated with false belief, bind the soul for countless lifetimes. Anantanubandhi anger, pride, deceit, and greed last until death. Even a momentary state of anger, pride, deceit, or greed, like that of King Prasannacandra, is considered Anantanubandhi, otherwise, there would be no opportunity to accumulate karma leading to hell.

## Kshaya-Swaroop

**Chapter 4, Verse 8-10 of Yoga Shastra**

Even after controlling time, there is still incompleteness in the characteristics like Sanjwalan, etc. Therefore, other characteristics are explained further.

**Verse 8:**

> **Vitaraga-Yati-Shraddha-Samyagdristi-tvaghatakaha | Te Devattva-Manushyattva-Tiryaktva-Narakapradaha ||8||**

**Meaning:**

> These four Kshayas (Sanjwalan, etc.) destroy Vitaragattva, Sadhutva, Shravaktva, and Samyaktva respectively. They also lead to Devatva, Manushyattva, Tiryaktva, and Narakattva respectively. ||8||

**Explanation:**

> By adding the suffix 'tv' to all, the meaning becomes - the four Kshayas destroy Vitaragattva, Sadhutva, Shravaktva, and Samyaktva respectively. In this way, when Sanjwalan-Krodha, etc. Kshayas arise, Sadhutva is present, but Vitaragattva is not. When Pratyakhyana-Avaraniya Kshaya arises, Shravaktva is present, but Sadhutva is not. When Apratyakhyana-Avaraniya arises, Samyagdristitva is present, but Desh-Virati-Shravaktva is not. And when Ananta-Anubandhi Kshaya arises, even Samyagdristitva is not present. In this way, Sanjwalan destroys Vitaragattva, Pratyakhyana-Avaraniya destroys Sadhutva, Apratyakhyana-Avaraniya destroys Shravaktva, and Ananta-Anubandhi destroys Samyaktva. This is how the clear characteristics are explained. Now, the latter part of the verse describes the fruits of Kshayas - when Sanjwalan, Krodha, Mana, Maya, and Lobha are present, the fruit of Devagati is obtained. When Pratyakhyana-Avarana, Krodha, etc. are present, Manushyagati is obtained. When Apratyakhyana-Avarana Kshaya is present, Tiryanchgati is obtained. And when Ananta-Anubandhi Kshaya is present, Narakagati is obtained. Now, the nature of these four Kshayas (Sanjwalan, etc.) is explained using similes - Sanjwalan, etc. four types of Krodha are like a line in water, a line in sand, a line on earth, and a line on a mountain respectively. And the four types of Mana are like a bamboo stick, a wooden stick, a bone, and a stone pillar respectively. The four types of Maya are like bamboo bark, wooden bark, a goat's horn, and a bamboo root respectively. And the four types of Lobha are like turmeric color, dirt on a pot, an insect on a cart wheel, and chili color respectively. ||8||

**Verse 9:**

> **Tatropatapakaha Krodhaha Krodho Vairasya Karanam | Durgatervartani Krodhaha Krodhaha Shamasukhargalah ||9||**

**Meaning:**

> Among these four, the first Kshaya, Krodha, causes suffering to both the body and mind. Krodha is the cause of enmity. Krodha is the path to hell. And Krodha is like an obstacle to peace and happiness. ||9||

**Explanation:**

> The word 'Krodha' is used repeatedly in this verse because Krodha is extremely evil and harmful to the soul. It burns itself and those around it with suffering, like fire. Enmity grows from Krodha, just like Subhumi and Parashurama became enemies and killed each other. Krodha leads to hell. ||9||

**Verse 10:**

> **Utpadyamaanaha Prathama, Dahaty-eva Swa-Ashrayam | Krodhaha Krishanuvath Paschad-anyam Dahati Va Na Va ||10||**

**Meaning:**

> When Krodha arises due to any cause, it first burns its own abode (where it arises), like fire. Later, it may or may not burn others, like fire. If the person in front is forgiving, he will not be burned, like a wet tree. ||10||

**Explanation:**

> Here, the meaning of the inner verses regarding Krodha is presented. A seeker may practice virtue for eight years or less than a koti years, but that much tapasya is burnt to ashes in a moment by the fire of Krodha, like a pile of grass. The water of equanimity, accumulated in a pot filled with great merit, becomes undrinkable in a moment by the mere contact of the poison of Krodha. The smoke of the fire of Krodha spreads and spreads, making the picture of virtue, which is the holder of wonderful qualities, extremely dark, like a kitchen. The tree of detachment

The nature of anger, its ill effects and the means to conquer it

Anger, like a large leaf of Palasha, casts down the harmony obtained from the small leaves of the fourth light of Yoga Shastra, verse 11, or the nectar of peace acquired in the soul over time. The sage Dvaipayana, due to the fire of anger, burnt the Yadava clan and the city of Dwarika along with its people to ashes. The success that sometimes seems to be achieved by getting angry is not due to anger, but should be understood as the fruit of strong virtuous deeds acquired in a previous birth. One who harbors the water of anger in his body, which spoils both his births and destroys his and others' wealth, is to be condemned. See for yourself, blinded by anger, the soul becomes merciless and destroys his father, mother, guru, friend, brother, wife and himself. ||10||

Giving the nature of anger, he advises on conquering it. ||337||
For one with a noble soul, the only refuge to immediately extinguish the fire of anger is forgiveness. Forgiveness alone can extinguish the fire of anger. Forgiveness is the bed in the garden of restraint, making it lush. ||11||

**Explanation:** If anger is not stopped at the beginning, it becomes impossible to stop it like a wildfire after it has grown. It is said that one should not trust even a little debt, a small wound, a little fire, and a little bit of attachment. Because it doesn't take long for even a little to become huge (grow). (A. Ni. Ga. 120) Therefore, one should take refuge in forgiveness as soon as anger arises. In this world, there is no other way to pacify anger except forgiveness. The fruit of anger is the cause of enmity, which in turn increases anger and cannot bring peace. Therefore, forgiveness alone is the one that pacifies anger. What kind of forgiveness is it? In answer to this, it is said that forgiveness is like a bed in the garden of restraint. New places of restraint and determination are planted and grown through forgiveness. Many types of trees are planted in the garden, and by making water beds in it, the flowers, fruits, and leaves of the trees grow. Forgiveness is the culmination of a peaceful mind. By giving it the form of a bed, new results of peace are produced.

The meaning of the verses on this subject is presented:

It is generally impossible to control anger towards harmful people, but it can be controlled by the influence of one's own endurance or by some kind of feeling. He who wants to give me pain by accepting his sin; he is killed by his own actions, who would be foolish enough to be angry with that man? No one! If such results arise in your mind, 'I will be angry with the wrongdoer', then why don't you get angry at your own actions, which are the cause of suffering? A dog does not bite the one who throws the stone, but goes to bite the stone, while a lion, without looking at the arrow, goes to catch the one who threw the arrow. A self-interested person does not get angry at the cruel deeds of a cruel person; rather, he gets angry at his own actions, while an ordinary person gets angry at the other (cause) rather than getting angry at his actions. What is the benefit of barking or speaking to others like a dog? Curse your actions, scold them. It is heard that the Shraman Bhagwan Mahavira went to the Mlechchha country with the desire to destroy the disease, then why don't you want to accept the forgiveness that came effortlessly? If the Lord, who is capable of destroying or protecting the three worlds, had forgiveness, then why can't you, a person like you, who is as weak as a banana, have forgiveness? Why not earn this effortless virtue so that no one can hurt you? Now, while blaming your negligence, accept forgiveness. There is no difference between a sage who is blind in anger and a Chandala who is angry. Therefore, one should abandon anger and consume the land of bright intellect, forgiveness. On the one hand, there was a great ascetic who was angry, and on the other hand, there was a Kurugaddduk Muni who only chanted Navkarasi; a Muni free from anger. But the gods worshipped Kurugaddduk Muni, leaving the great sage. Hearing the polluted, heart-touching words from the point of view of the scriptures,

## Standard Aversion and its Consequences

**Verse 12-13 from the Fourth Light of Yoga Shastra**

Instead of being distressed, consider this: If the speaker is telling me the truth, why should I be angry? If he is lying, then consider his words as those of a madman! If someone comes to kill me, look at him with a smile, knowing that my death is due to my own actions, and this fool is merely dancing in vain. If someone comes to kill me, think in your mind that my death will occur only when my lifespan is complete. Or think, if I had no sins, why would this poor fellow come to kill me? Anger is not directed at those who take away all our efforts, so why be so angry at someone who commits a minor offense? Therefore, shame on you. To conquer anger, which advances like a fierce serpent, paralyzing all the senses, constantly embrace blameless forgiveness, like the wisdom of a skilled snake charmer.

**Now the nature of Standard Aversion is explained.**

Standard Aversion is destructive to humility, scripture, and good character, and it is also destructive to the three goals of life: Dharma, Artha, and Kama. Standard Aversion destroys the vision of discernment in humans, making them blind.

**Explanation:**

Standard Aversion is destructive to humility, which is the proper way to treat elders and superiors, to scripture, and to good character.  A person who is arrogant due to their caste or other factors becomes like a demon, and does not show humility to elders.  Because they do not serve their elders, they cannot acquire knowledge.  As a result, they exhibit their bad character by disrespecting everyone.  Standard Aversion is not only destructive to humility, scripture, and good character, but also to the three goals of life: Dharma, Artha, and Kama.  An arrogant person cannot control their senses, so how can they achieve Dharma?  An arrogant person, due to their stubbornness, cannot serve kings and others, so how can they achieve Artha?  A person can only achieve Kama if they are gentle.  How can a person who is arrogant like a thief achieve Kama?  Standard Aversion blinds a person, making them unable to discern right from wrong.  This is the natural consequence of not serving those who are knowledgeable and wise.  Therefore, Standard Aversion leads to blindness, which is easily understood.

**Now the different types of Standard Aversion are explained, along with their consequences.**

A person who becomes proud of their caste, wealth, family, power, beauty, austerity, or knowledge, will experience the opposite in their next life.

**Explanation:**

A wise person never becomes proud of their caste, knowing that there are many different types of castes, including the highest, the middle, and the lowest.  A person who is born into a high caste due to good karma will be born into a lower caste due to bad karma.  Therefore, no one should be proud of their caste, as it is impermanent.  A person who gains wealth due to the destruction of obstacles to their karma will not be proud of their wealth, knowing that it is not permanent.  A person who is born into a noble family due to the good qualities of their family will not be proud of their family, knowing that there is no connection between the qualities of a family and the qualities of its members.  A person who has power due to the power of Indra, who holds the thunderbolt and rules over the three worlds, will not be proud of their power, knowing that it is not permanent.  A person who is beautiful due to the grace of others will not be proud of their beauty, knowing that it is not permanent.  A person who is austere due to the grace of others will not be proud of their austerity, knowing that it is not permanent.  A person who is knowledgeable due to the grace of others will not be proud of their knowledge, knowing that it is not permanent.  Therefore, a wise person will not be proud of any of these things, knowing that they are all impermanent.

Mardava and the nature of maya, and their consequences

Yogashastra, Caturtha Prakasha, Sloka 14:

It is not appropriate to be proud even of one's own strength. Even the strong are seen to become weak at the time of old age or the rise of other karmas. Therefore, pride in one's strength is futile. This body, made of seven dhatus, keeps increasing and decreasing, and in old age becomes afflicted with diseases; so who will be proud of the form of such a perishable body? How beautiful was the form of Sanatkumara Chakravarti? But in a short time, the beauty of his form was destroyed. Considering this, who will be the person who will be proud of his form even in a dream? Hearing about the pinnacle of the tapas of Bhagavan Rishabhadeva and Bhagavan Mahavira, who will have pride in their own extremely little tapas? The pride in that tapas, by which the entire cluster of karmas can be destroyed at once, only increases the cluster of karmas. The one who, by practicing the scriptures composed by others, with the effort of his own limited intellect, composes treatises and takes pride in his own omniscience, is actually consuming his own limbs. Bhagavan Ganadhara had the power to compose and recollect the Dvadashangi; knowing this, which wise person will have pride in his own scriptural knowledge? No one will.

Many acharyas speak of pride in wealth and pride in tapas, instead of pride in devotion and pride in intellect. They give this instruction regarding them: A poor person, burdened by the weight of favors, commits bad deeds to obtain the affection of other people; well, how can he be proud of that? The one who, having obtained the affection granted by the grace of others, takes pride in it, drowns in the ocean of sorrow when that affection departs. Seeing the various aspects of the intellect, the methods of its enhancement, its alternatives, and the inequality and subtlety of its infinite modes, the great men of ancient times, who were endowed with intellect infinitely superior to the six-situated, were like lions in comprehending and imparting the meaning of the sutras, creating new compositions, contemplating on the meanings and ascertaining them; knowing this, how can the man of limited intellect of this era take pride in his own intellect?

In this way, the nature of pride and its divisions have been expounded. Now, they teach the instruction of mardava (which is the means of conquering pride).

Sloka 14: Utsarpayan doshashakhah, gunamulanyabho nayan | Unmulaniyo manadus tanmardava-sarit-plavai ||

Meaning: The tree of pride, whose branches are the faults and whose roots are the virtues, should be uprooted with the force of the river of mardava (humility).

Explanation: The proud person's faults are like the spreading branches of the tree of pride, while the virtues are like the roots that go downward. As the tree of pride grows, the cluster of faults increases, and the cluster of virtues decreases. How can such a tree of pride be uprooted? In this regard, it is said that the tree of pride should be uprooted by the swift current of the river of mardava (humility). The more the tree of pride grows, the more the roots of virtues get hidden, and the branches of faults keep increasing, which cannot be uprooted by axes and the like; it can only be uprooted by the swift flow of the river of humility.

The meaning of the internal slokas on the same topic is as follows:

Mardava means softness, gentleness, and the abandonment of arrogance. Arrogance is the natural, inherent nature of pride. In whatever subject - caste, etc. - pride arises, one should take refuge in humility to counter it. One should practice gentleness, humility, and reverence in every situation, and especially show reverence to venerable persons, because the worship of venerable persons purifies one's sins, and the individual becomes free from sins. Bahubali Muni was enveloped by the creepers of sins due to the sway of pride, and when he contemplated humility in his mind, he immediately became free from sins and attained Kevala-jnana. Even the former Chakravarti, renouncing his connection with the world, goes for alms even to the house of an enemy. In reality, abandoning pride and adopting mardava is extremely difficult. Even after initiation, the former Chakravarti immediately pays obeisance to the former poor ascetic.

## The Nature of Maya and Simplicity

**Chapter Four, Light of Yoga, Verses 15-16**

Abandoning one's pride, one serves for a long time. Thus, by considering the mental defects, practicing humility gives rise to many virtues. Knowing this, one should abandon pride and, being absorbed in the unique virtue of *mardava* (gentleness) of the righteous path, immediately take refuge in it. ||14||

Now, the nature of the *maya* (illusion) *kṣaya* (passion) is explained. ||341||

The mother of untruth, the axe to the tree of good character, the birthplace of ignorance, *maya* is the cause of misery. ||15||

**Meaning:** *Maya* is the mother of falsehood, it is the axe that cuts down the tree of good character, it is the birthplace of ignorance (falsehood and lack of knowledge), and it is the cause of misery. ||15||

**Implication:** In reality, without *maya*, falsehood cannot stand. The meaning of *maya* is the result of deceiving others. One who practices *maya* to deceive others, deceives himself in the ultimate sense. ||15||

Therefore, the fruit of *maya* is indicated. ||342||

Cunning and deceitful, like a heron, they deceive the world with *maya*, but in reality, they deceive themselves. ||16||

**Meaning:** Skilled in cunning, the sinful, like herons, with hypocritical behavior, deceive the world with *maya*, but in reality, they deceive themselves. ||16||

**Explanation:** The third *kṣaya* is *maya*; one who deceives the world with it, deceives his own soul. He practices the sinful act of *maya*, like a heron, with the intention of hiding his sinful deeds. Just as a heron slowly maneuvers to deceive fish, so too does a deceiver maneuver like a heron to deceive the world. Here, the question arises: if a deceiver deceives the world and hides his *maya*, how does he bear the burden of accumulated *maya*? In response, it is said: without skill in deception, one can never deceive another, nor can one hide his *maya*. One who is adept in cunning is able to deceive others and keep it hidden.

Here, the implication of some inner verses is presented: Kings, through cunning strategies, conspiracies, espionage, and secret operations, deceitfully kill trustworthy individuals for the sake of wealth, deceiving others. Brahmins, with tilak on their foreheads, displaying various hand gestures, chanting mantras, and taking advantage of others' weaknesses, deceive people with their outward show while being devoid of heart. Merchants, by creating false weights and measures, deceive innocent people through deceitful actions. Many people, by wearing matted hair, shaving their heads, or keeping long braids, applying ashes, wearing saffron robes, or remaining naked, while being atheists in their hearts and outwardly pretending to be devout, deceive good and faithful patrons. Emotionless courtesans, through their gestures, luxury, and seductive gait, or by casting glances, or through various dances, songs, and other forms of entertainment, attract lustful men in an instant and deceive them. Gamblers, by taking false oaths, creating false coins and dice, extort money from the wealthy. Husbands, wives, parents, siblings, friends, relatives, employers, employees, and others do not hesitate to deceive each other. A greedy man is always wary of a flattering thief, but he is deceived by the careless. Craftsmen and Chandals, through their ancestral trades, make a living, but they deceive good people by taking false oaths. Cruel *Vyantardev* and other *kuyoni* (low caste) ghosts, spirits, *pishachas*, and demons, knowing that humans and animals are careless, often harass them in various ways. Fish and other aquatic creatures, through trickery, swallow their own young. Fishermen, through deceit, catch them with nets. Skilled hunters, through various means, trap and bind foolish land animals, and then kill them. Cruel hunters, for the sake of a little meat, cruelly bind innocent birds, parrots, mynas, partridges, quails, and other aerial creatures. Thus, in the whole world, self-deceivers are engaged in deceiving each other, neglecting their own dharma and...

The Glory of Simplicity and the Nature of Greed
Chapter 4 of Yoga Shastra, Verses 17-18

They destroy the path to liberation. Therefore, a wise person should abandon the illusion, which is like a fire to the tree of faith, like the root of the city of liberation, and like the seed of birth in the animal realm. In a previous life, the soul of Shri Mallinath had a small amount of illusion. Because he did not remove that illusion, that is, he did not purify himself through introspection and atonement, he received the female form as a result of the power of illusion, becoming the world-ruler, a Tirthankara. ||16||

Now, to conquer illusion, they inspire the virtue of simplicity. ||343|| 
Tad-arjva-mahaushadhya, Jagadananda-hetu-na. Jayej-jagadrohakari, Mayaam vishadhari-miv. ||17||
Meaning: Therefore, one should conquer the serpent-like illusion, which harms the world, with the medicine of righteousness, simplicity, which brings joy to the beings of the world. ||17||
Explanation: For the people of the world, the special joy of righteousness (arjva) is a health-giving medicine, which, by conquering the illusion-passion, without giving up deceit, becomes the cause of liberation. _ In this regard, the inner verses present the meaning: Even in other religious scriptures, it is said in principle that if there is a straight path to the city of liberation, it is the path of simplicity; the rest of the paths are just an expansion of conduct. In short, understand that deceit is the cause of death, while simplicity is the cause of immortality. This knowledge alone is true knowledge; the rest is nonsense. In the world, a person who is rich in simplicity becomes an object of love, while a person full of deceit becomes anxious like a serpent. A person with a simple mind, even while living in the world, experiences the natural and effortless joy of liberation. How can a person with a troubled mind, bound by the nail of deceit, and skilled in deception like a hunter, experience that joy even in a dream? Even if a person is clever in all arts, proficient in all knowledge, but the simplicity of a child is only bestowed upon a fortunate one. The simplicity of an ignorant child makes him an object of love. If a person is well-versed in the meaning of all scriptures and also has simplicity, what can be said! Simplicity is natural, deceit is artificial. Therefore, who will hold on to the artificial and illusory dharma, leaving aside the natural dharma? It is rare that those who are skilled in deceit, trickery, fraud, lies, gossip, and speaking one thing on the face and having another feeling in the heart, can remain unaffected like a golden statue. Ganadhara Shri Gautam Swami was proficient in the ocean of scriptures, yet it is surprising that he listened to the words of the Lord with the simplicity of a newly initiated disciple. No matter how many evil deeds one has done, but the one who criticizes his own evil deeds with simplicity, destroys all his actions. But if one criticizes with pride, hiding deceit like Lakshmana's wife, then even a small amount of sin will become the cause of worldly increase. Liberation is attained only by one whose soul is full of all kinds of simplicity. One whose mind, speech, and actions (body) are full of deceit, will never be liberated. Therefore, the character of seekers who are simple in their results is described as blameless, and seekers who are deceitful in their results become participants in the fierce bondage of karma. By comparing these two with the intellect, the seeker with pure intellect should take refuge in the unparalleled simplicity. ||17||

Now, the nature of greed is explained. ||344||
Aakaraha sarvado-shaanaam, gunagra-sanrakshasah. Kando vyasanavalli-naam, lobhah sarvarth-badhakah. ||18||
Meaning: Just as the mine is the source of all metals like iron, so greed is the source of all vices like violence. It is a demon that swallows up virtues like knowledge, and it is the root of the vines of misfortune (suffering). In fact, greed is an obstacle to all purposes, dharma, artha, kama, and moksha. ||18||
Explanation: Greed-passion is the source of all vices, the destroyer of all virtues, the cause of suffering, and the destroyer of all purposes. Therefore, greed is invincible. ||18||

The next three verses describe the nature of greed.

The main remedy to conquer greed is contentment.

**Yoga Shastra, Fourth Light, Verses 19-22**

**Verse 19:** The poor man desires one hundred, the one who has one hundred desires a thousand, the owner of a thousand desires a lakh, the lakhpati desires a crore, and the crorepati desires to become a king.

**Verse 20:** The king desires to become an emperor, the emperor desires to become a god, and even the god desires to become Indra.

**Verse 21:** Even after attaining the position of Indra, if the desire does not cease, then the initial small greed grows like an arrow.

**Meaning:** A poor man desires one hundred rupees, the one who has one hundred desires a thousand, the owner of a thousand desires a lakh, the lakhpati desires a crore, and the crorepati desires to become a king. The king desires to become an emperor, the emperor desires to become a god, and even the god desires to become Indra. But even after attaining the position of Indra, if the desire does not cease, then the initial small greed grows like an arrow.

**Explanation:**

The meaning of these verses in relation to greed is that just as violence is the greatest sin among all sins, falsehood is the greatest among all actions, and consumption is the greatest among all diseases, so too is greed the greatest vice among all vices. Alas! Greed reigns supreme on this earth. Due to greed, even the one-sensed trees and plants, when they find treasure, cover it up and hold it tight in their roots. Due to greed for wealth, the five-sensed beings also make a place for themselves near buried treasure and stay there in a state of unconsciousness. Serpents, earthworms, mongooses, rats, etc., all five-sensed beings also stay near places of treasure due to greed and attachment. Ghosts, Mudgalas, spirits, pretas, and yakshas also reside on their own or others' wealth due to greed and unconsciousness. Deities also fall from their position and are born in the womb of earth, etc., due to unconsciousness over ornaments, gardens, wells, etc. Even a sadhu, after reaching the state of tranquility and conquering anger, etc., falls back into lower states due to the fault of just a little greed. Just as dogs fight over a piece of meat, so too do brothers born from the same mother fight over a little wealth. A greedy man, in order to claim ownership of a village, mountain, or forest, abandons compassion and creates discord among the villagers, rulers, and kings, making them enemies of each other. Even if a person does not have an excess of laughter, sorrow, hatred, or attachment, he dances like a clown in front of his master due to greed, pretending to be his beloved. The more you try to fill the pit of greed, the deeper it becomes. It is amazing that the ocean can perhaps be filled with water, but even after obtaining the kingdom of the three worlds, the ocean of greed does not fill up. Man has consumed an infinite amount of food, clothing, objects, and wealth, but still, the greed in his mind does not diminish. If greed is abandoned, then what is the use of austerity? And if greed is not abandoned, then what is the use of fruitless austerity? After churning the essence of all scriptures, I have come to the conclusion that the great-minded seeker should strive only to destroy greed.

**Verse 22:** The ocean of greed is very turbulent and difficult to cross. It is difficult to stop its rising tide. Therefore, the wise man should build a bridge of contentment and stop it from advancing.

**Meaning:** Contentment is the opposite mental quality of greed. Just as a dam is built to stop water, so too should a dam of contentment be built to stop the poison of greed and conquer it.

**Explanation:**

Just as the emperor is considered the best among men and Indra is considered the best among gods, so too is contentment considered the best among all qualities. If we compare the happiness and sorrow of a contented sadhu and an unsatisfied emperor, the sadhu will appear to be more joyful and the emperor more sorrowful. The emperor, who is free from attachment due to the desire to drink the nectar of contentment, can abandon his kingdom of six continents in an instant and attain freedom from attachment.

##  Conquering the Four Kṣayās and Indriyas: A Description

**Chapter Four, Light of Yoga, Verses 23-25**

**Verse 23:**

* **Content:**  This verse summarizes the conquest of the four Kṣayās (poisons): anger, pride, deceit, and greed. It states that anger is conquered by patience, pride by humility, deceit by simplicity, and greed by non-attachment (santosha). 
* **Explanation:**  While both conquering the Kṣayās and the Indriyas (senses) are considered causes of liberation, conquering the Kṣayās is considered more important, with conquering the Indriyas being a prerequisite.

**Verse 24:**

* **Content:**  This verse emphasizes the importance of conquering the Indriyas for achieving victory over the Kṣayās. It states that one cannot conquer the Kṣayās without first conquering the Indriyas. 
* **Explanation:**  The verse uses the analogy of the cold of winter (Hemant) and fire. Just as the cold of winter cannot be overcome without fire, the Kṣayās cannot be conquered without conquering the Indriyas.

**Verse 25:**

* **Content:**  This verse warns about the dangers of uncontrolled Indriyas. It states that uncontrolled Indriyas, like wild horses, can drag a person to the forest of hell (Naraka).
* **Explanation:**  The verse highlights the importance of controlling the Indriyas to avoid falling into the clutches of the Kṣayās and their consequences. 

**Summary:**

These verses emphasize the importance of conquering both the Kṣayās and the Indriyas for achieving liberation. Conquering the Indriyas is essential for conquering the Kṣayās, and both are crucial for attaining liberation.

The Story of King Sudama
Yoga Shastra, Fourth Light, Verses 26-27

Meaning: Here, the senses are compared to horses. A horse is naturally restless, and if the rider does not control it, it will quickly run away into the desolate, rugged jungle. Similarly, those who do not control their senses are forced by them onto the wrong path, leading them to hell. This means that if one does not conquer their senses, they will be destined for hell. || 25 ||

How does a slave to the senses go to hell? This is explained:
|| 352 || Indriyai:rvijit: jantu: kshayair abhibhuyate. Viraih krishteishtaka: purvam vaprah kai: kai:n khandhyate? || 26 ||

A being who is defeated by the senses is overcome by kshayas (negative emotions). When brave warriors pull out a brick from a fort, who then cannot break it? Even a weak man can then destroy it. || 26 ||

Meaning:

Explanation:
• A soul that cannot conquer its senses is also subdued by kshayas; they take over. Therefore, the first advice given is to conquer the senses in order to conquer kshayas. Conversely, one who does not strive for victory over the senses becomes subject to kshayas through the senses and becomes destined for hell. Here, there is a doubt: if someone is unable to conquer their senses, they may face obstacles in conquering them, but how can there be an opportunity for obstacles to arise in conquering kshayas? This is explained through an example: a brave warrior pulls out a brick from a fort, and then his weaker companions easily pull out one brick after another, collapsing the fort. Similarly, a person defeated by the senses is immediately defeated by kshayas, like an ordinary man. Because kshayas usually follow the senses. Therefore, one who has not subdued the senses is defeated by kshayas and goes to hell, losing both in this world and in this life. || 26 ||

This is also said:
|| 353 || Kulaghatay paatay, bandhay cha vadhay cha. Anirjitan: jayante, karanani sharirirnam || 27 ||

Meaning: Unconquered (uncontrolled) senses are destructive to the family of embodied beings, causing downfall, bondage, and death. || 27 ||

Explanation:
• If the senses are not suppressed, these unrestrained senses invite the destruction of the lineage in this life, corruption of the kingdom, bondage in prison (jail), and death. Ravana could not control his senses, he desired to have sexual relations with another man's wife; because of this, Rama and Lakshmana destroyed his lineage. This example has been mentioned before. If the senses are not controlled, a ruler like King Sudama becomes dethroned or degraded.

The Story of King Sudama:
In a city, King Sudama ruled. He was very fond of eating different kinds of meat. He ate meat with great passion and was very happy. One day, his cook had cooked meat and kept it aside, but a cat snatched it while he was momentarily distracted. The devout followers of the city had made a proclamation of Amaripattah (non-violence) to please the king that day; therefore, no living being was to be killed that day, so no meat of any kind could be found. Therefore, fearing the king's anger, the cook brought a child and cooked its meat and fed it to the king, satisfying him. The king found the meat very delicious, so he took the cook aside, made him swear an oath, and asked him. The cook told him the whole truth. The king now developed a craving for human flesh. He deployed servants everywhere in the city to catch all the children. When the city dwellers found out about this, they united, persuaded the minister, the chief administrator, and everyone else to their side, and got the king drunk until he fainted. Later, they tied him up and left him in the jungle. King Sudama, under the control of his tongue, was dethroned from his kingdom, separated from his family and lineage, and lay in the jungle, groaning like a dog.

## The Defects of the Senses and Victory Over Them

**Chapter Four, Light Four, Verses 28-33**

The senses, when not under control, bind a person like the king Chandapradyota. Those who are under the control of their senses become guests of death, like Ravana. This story has been told before. 

Here are some internal verses on this topic, whose meaning is presented:

What living being does not experience irony by being attached to the objects of the senses? Even those who are masters of the scriptures, who know the ultimate purpose of the scriptures, act like children. 

Bharata Chakra threw his chakra weapon at Bahubali, yet Bahubali was victorious and Bharata was defeated. This was all a play of the senses! They were destined to go to liberation in that very birth, yet they fought with weapons. 

Indeed, householders are repeatedly punished by their unruly senses; this is understandable. But that peaceful, former-holder, the seeker, is punished by the senses. This is astonishing. It is a pity. 

Devas, Danavas, and humans have been defeated more by the senses. Even though they are great ascetics, they do not shy away from doing evil deeds. 

Under the influence of the senses, humans eat inedible things, drink undrinkable things, and use unusable things. A man, helpless under the control of his senses, abandons his family's honor and shamelessly engages in low acts and slavery at a prostitute's place. 

Understand that the tendency towards another's wealth and another's wife in a man blinded by delusion is a play of uncontrolled senses. 

The hands, feet, senses, and limbs of living beings are cut off, and they are even killed. The cause of all this is the slavery of the senses. Therefore, salutations from afar to such senses! 

Those who preach humility to others and themselves lose to their senses are laughed at by wise men, who cover their mouths with their hands. 

In this world, from the ant to Indra, all beings, except the liberated soul, are defeated by the senses. 

Thus, the defects of the senses have been explained in general. Now, the defects of each sense, such as touch, etc., are explained in five verses. 

**Verse 28:** The elephant, extending its trunk to taste the pleasure of touching the female elephant, immediately gets into trouble by being bound to a pillar.

**Verse 29:** The fish, living in the depths of water, comes to eat a piece of meat on the iron hook of a net, and without a doubt, it falls into the hands of the fisherman.

**Verse 30:** The bumblebee, attracted to the scent, sits on the temple of a maddened elephant, but it becomes a victim of death by the clap of its ears.

**Verse 31:** The moth, fascinated by the light of the lamp, which shines like the brilliance of gold, falls upon the lamp and meets its death.

**Verse 32:** The deer, engrossed in listening to the song of the doe, is pierced by the hunter's arrow, which is drawn to the ear. It meets its death.

**Verse 33:** Thus, each of these five senses, touch, taste, smell, sight, and hearing, leads to death when indulged in individually. How then can the indulgence of all five senses together not lead to death? It will certainly happen.

## The Defects of the Senses and Victory Over Them

**Fourth Light of Yoga Shastra, Verse 34, Meaning:**

It is said that "attachment to one thing destroys all five senses, then one who is deluded and attached to the objects of all five senses together, is burnt to ashes after death." (33)

Now, giving advice on how to achieve victory over the senses, it is said: "Therefore, the wise seeker should conquer the senses through the purification of the mind. Because without conquering the senses, the practice of Yama and Niyama is a futile bodily exertion for humans." (34)

**Explanation:**

The senses are of two types: material and mental. Skin, tongue, nose, eyes, and ears, which are formed from the material substance of pudgala, are material senses. And the desire for objects like touch, taste, smell, sight, and sound is the mental sense. One should renounce attachment to them and conquer them.

In this regard, the meaning of the inner verses is presented: A being defeated by the senses is troubled by many sorrows. Therefore, to be free from all sorrows, one should control the senses. Completely stopping the flow of the senses is not victory over them, but rather, the flow should be free from attachment and aversion; only then is it called victory over the senses. It is impossible to remove the contact of the senses with their objects; therefore, wise people renounce attachment and aversion that arise from those objects. The senses of a restrained yogi are always controlled in both ways. In beneficial restraint-yoga, the senses remain uncontrolled, and in harmful yogas like carelessness, they are controlled. That is, in the practice of Yama and Niyama, the senses remain engaged in the practice of restraint without being controlled (killed), but in objects, passions, carelessness, etc., the senses are controlled (killed). This is the secret of conquering the senses. Victory over the senses leads to liberation, and defeat by the senses leads to wandering in the world! Knowing the difference between the two, follow what seems beneficial. The entire foundation of karma-bondage lies in the pleasure and displeasure experienced from the soft touch of a cotton mattress, etc., and the hard touch of a stone, etc. Therefore, renounce pleasure and displeasure towards touch and become a conqueror of the sense of touch. Renounce the liking for delicious and palatable food and the dislike for tasteless food, and become a conqueror of the sense of taste. Renounce attachment and aversion towards fragrant substances and foul odors, knowing their nature and consequences, and conquer the sense of smell. Renounce joy and disgust towards beautiful forms that please the mind and eyes, and ugly forms that are the opposite, and become a conqueror of the sense of sight. Renounce attachment towards the sweet, ear-pleasing melodies of the veena and other instruments, and aversion towards the ugly, repulsive, ear-piercing, harsh, and insulting sounds of donkeys, camels, etc., and conquer the sense of hearing. There is no object in this world that is completely beautiful or completely ugly, which the senses have not experienced in all previous births. Why then do you not remain neutral towards it? You imagine ugliness in good things and goodness in bad things; then how will you free your senses from attachment and make them full of detachment? The same reason for which you say that there should be liking (attachment) towards something, the same reason can lead to disgust and aversion towards it! In reality, objects are neither good nor bad in themselves; it is the human perspective that makes them good or bad. Therefore, with a detached mind, renounce the attachment and aversion that are the flow of the objects of the senses, and desire to become a conqueror of the senses.

What is the way to conquer these invincible senses? It is explained: First, purity of mind is essential, and the practice of Yama and Niyama is also necessary. Serving the elderly and studying scriptures are also causes of victory over the senses. The extraordinary cause among all these is the purity of the mind. The other causes are not absolute and ultimate. Without purity of mind, even if Yama and Niyama, etc., are practiced, they cannot be causes of victory over the senses. This is stated in the same verse: "Without them, Yama and Niyama, etc." Yama refers to the five great vows, which are the root virtues, and Niyama refers to the purification of the body, the secrecy of the community, etc., which are the subsequent virtues. Serving the elderly, etc., is a bodily exertion, but without purity of mind, all this effort is futile. Like Marudevi, etc., many...

## Uncontrolled Mind and its Restraint Measures

**Yoga Shastra, Fourth Light, Verses 35 to 39**

For some, mental purity is natural, while others need to control their minds through means like Yama and Niyama. (34)

What does an uncontrolled mind do? The following verse explains. (361)

The uncontrolled mind, like a demon, roams freely and without fear, throwing the beings of the three worlds into the abyss of the whirlpool of Samsara. (35)

**Explanation:** There are two types of mind: Dravya-mana and Bhava-mana. Dravya-mana is the Pudgala transformed into a specific form, while Bhava-mana is the Atma-parinam, in the form of Sankalpa, arising from the Pudgala-dravya. The mind itself is the demon in the form of Sankalpa, whose nature is to incline towards evil objects. Therefore, it does not seek stability in any particular object. How does the mind roam? The answer is: without fear. The mind, emerging from the realm of its own nature, roams freely and falls into the abyss of the cycle of Samsara, making it difficult to escape. There is no being in the three worlds who has not been thrown into the abyss of Samsara by the uncontrolled mind. (35)

The flaws of the uncontrolled mind are further explained. (362)

The restless mind, like a storm, throws those who desire liberation and those who practice severe austerities, away from their path. (36)

Further flaws of the uncontrolled mind are revealed. (363)

One who has faith in Yoga without restraining the mind, is like a lame person desiring to go to another village, and becomes an object of ridicule for the wise. (37)

Not only is faith in Yoga futile without restraining the mind, but such a restless mind invites many evil deeds. This is explained in the latter part of the next verse, while the former part describes the fruit of restraining the mind. (364)

By restraining the mind from objects, the influx of karma ceases from all sides. For one who does not restrain the mind, karma increases from all sides. (38)

**Explanation:** By restraining the mind, karma like Jnanavaraniya, etc., ceases to flow, because the influx of karma is under the control of the mind. One who does not restrain the mind, increases karma, because the bondage of karma is under the control of the uncontrolled mind. Therefore, one should strive to control the mind. (38)

This is further explained. (365)

The mind is like a monkey, a monkey that loves to roam the entire world. Therefore, one who desires liberation should strive to control their monkey-like mind. (39)

**Explanation:** The mind is restless like a monkey, this is a universally experienced truth. The similarity between the mind and the monkey is explained: just as a monkey roams freely in the forest, without any control over its movement, so too does the mind roam freely in the forest of the world. Therefore, it is said: the mind loves to roam, grabbing different objects and being restless. One should free oneself from the restlessness of such an uncontrolled mind and engage it in appropriate objects. How can this be done? Through the effort of practice. Who should do this? One who desires liberation of the soul. The meaning is that only one who can restrain the restlessness of the mind can be successful in the pursuit of liberation. (39)

##  Mind Conquest

**Chapter Four of Yoga Shastra, Verses 40-44**

Now, we praise the purity of mind, which is the cause of conquering the senses. (366)

**Verse 40:**

> The purity of mind is the only lamp, declared by the wise, that never extinguishes and always shows the path to liberation.

**Meaning:**

> The ancient teachers have accepted that even without Yama, Niyama, etc., the purity of mind alone is such a lamp that never extinguishes and always shows the path to liberation.

**Explanation:**

> It is also said that if someone makes a great effort in auspicious yogas like knowledge, meditation, charity, honor, silence, etc., but their mind is not pure (clean), then their effort should be considered like pouring ghee into ashes. (4)

Now, we give advice with the view of explaining the benefits of purity of mind through analogy and contrast. (367)

**Verse 41:**

> If the mind is pure, even if other qualities are absent, they still exist due to the goodness of their fruits. Conversely, if the mind is not pure, even if other qualities are present, qualities like forgiveness, etc., do not exist because their fruits are absent. Therefore, wise men should definitely cultivate the fruitful purity of mind.

**Meaning:**

> If there is purity of mind and other qualities are not present, then also the qualities like forgiveness, etc., remain due to the goodness of their fruits. On the contrary, if there is no purity of mind, then even if other qualities are present, qualities like forgiveness, etc., are not present because their fruits are absent. Therefore, wise men should definitely cultivate the fruitful purity of mind.

**Explanation:**

> To those who say, "What is the need for purity of mind? We will attain liberation through the power of austerity," we give this reply. (368)

**Verse 42:**

> Those who strive for liberation through austerity without purity of mind are like those who want to cross the great ocean by abandoning the boat and using their arms.

**Meaning:**

> Those who strive for liberation through austerity without purity of mind are like those who want to cross the great ocean by abandoning the boat and using their arms.

**Explanation:**

> Those who neglect purity of mind, saying, "Austerity combined with meditation is liberating," and who declare, "Meditation is the cause of the destruction of karma," we give this reply. (369)

**Verse 43:**

> Just as a mirror is useless for the blind, so too is meditation for a pure ascetic without purity of mind.

**Meaning:**

> Just as a mirror is useless for the blind, so too is meditation for a pure ascetic without purity of mind.

**Explanation:**

> Although it is heard that a person can reach the ninth stage of liberation through the power of austerity and meditation without purity of mind, this statement should be understood as a general rule. And attaining the ninth stage of liberation is a worldly fruit, which is not considered in the calculation of fruits. The fruit that leads to liberation is considered the fruit here. Therefore, it is useless to expect the fruit of liberation from mere meditation without purity of mind. Although a mirror is a means of seeing form, it is useless for someone who is blind. Similarly, meditation without purity of mind is useless.

Now, we conclude. (370)

**Verse 44:**

> Therefore, a seeker who desires liberation must definitely cultivate purity of mind. What is the benefit of fasting, study of scriptures, the great vow of Yama, and other rules of conduct, except for bodily punishment?

**Meaning:**

> Therefore, a seeker who desires liberation must definitely cultivate purity of mind. What is the benefit of fasting, study of scriptures, the great vow of Yama, and other rules of conduct, except for bodily punishment?

**Explanation:**

> Here, it should also be added that "How does purity of mind occur?" Purity of mind occurs through the purity of the leshyas. Therefore, we explain the leshyas in this context.

**Description of Leshyas:**

> There are six leshyas: black, blue, dove-colored, radiant, lotus-colored, and white. The appearance of corresponding results in the soul with the help of colored matter according to the karma-varna is called leshya. Although the soul is pure and clear like crystal, due to the influence of karma, it becomes colored by the leshyas.

## The Importance of Purity of Mind and the Description of Leshyas

**Yoga Shastra, Fourth Light, Verse 44**

The term "Leshya" is used in relation to the soul because of the influence of the Leshya-dravya (Leshya-substance). Due to the accumulation of black-colored, inauspicious pudgals (particles), the soul's results are the most impure. Therefore, that soul is considered to be a possessor of Krishna-leshya. Due to the proximity of blue-colored substances, the soul's results are more impure, hence that soul is considered to be a possessor of Neel-leshya. Due to the presence of Kapotavर्ण (pigeon-colored) substances, the soul's results are impure, therefore that soul is called Kapotavर्ण-leshya. Due to the presence of yellow-colored substances, the soul's results are pure accordingly, hence the soul is called Tejo-leshya. Due to the proximity of Padma-colored substances, the soul's results are purer accordingly, therefore that soul is considered to be possessed by Padma-leshya. And due to the proximity of white-colored substances, the soul's results are the purest (completely pure), therefore that soul is possessed by Shukla-leshya.

Krishna, Neel, etc., all the dravya-karma-prakritis (substance-action-natures) have their essence (extract) as the Bhava-leshya (emotional Leshya) that arises from their respective attributes. This is the cause of the state of karma-bandha (bondage of karma). In the 38th verse of the Prashmarati-prakaran (chapter on pacification and joy), it is said: "There are six Leshyas named Krishna, Neel, Kapotavर्ण, Tejas, Padma, and Shukla; they solidify the state of karma-bandha in the same way that a stable and permanent color is created in painting."

In this way, the aforementioned six Leshyas are called the most impure, more impure, impure, pure, purer, and purest, due to their being the results of the soul. To explain the nature of Leshyas, the example of the Jamun tree and the village-destroyer is given in detail.

Therefore, the meaning of the verses from the Agamas (scriptural texts) that explain this topic are presented here:

In a forest, six men saw a Jamun tree. It was laden with ripe fruits, and its branches were bent down with the weight. Seeing the tree in this state, everyone expressed their desire to eat the Jamuns and said, "How shall we eat the Jamuns?" One of them said, "It is very difficult to climb this tree, it is dangerous for life. Therefore, let it be cut down from the root, so that we can eat the Jamuns without worry." Another said, "Oh! What is the use of cutting down such a big tree? We only want to eat the fruits, so let us just cut down the big branches of this tree and drop them down, and then eat them." The third said, "Our work will be done by just cutting down the small branches, what is the point of cutting down the big branches?" The fourth said, "Oh! Our work will be done by just breaking off the bunches of fruits." The fifth said, "We should only break off the ripe fruits that are fit to eat." Finally, the sixth said, "Why do we need to break off the fruits from the tree? There are as many fruits lying under the tree as we want to eat, let us just pick them up and eat them."

Explaining this example, it is said: The one who said to cut down the tree from the root is possessed by Krishna-leshya; the one who said to cut down the big branches is possessed by Neel-leshya; the one who said to cut down the small branches is possessed by Kapotavर्ण-leshya; the one who said to break off the bunches of fruits is possessed by Tejo-leshya; the one who said to break off only the ripe fruits is possessed by Padma-leshya; and the one who said to pick up the fruits that had fallen from the tree on their own is possessed by Shukla-leshya.

This is explained by another example: Once, six robbers went to loot a village. One of the robbers said, "Kill all the creatures in the village, whether they have two legs or four legs." The second said, "Why kill the four-legged animals, only the two-legged humans should be killed." The third said, "Oh! Why kill the women? Only the men should be killed." The fourth said, "Instead of killing all the men, only those who have weapons should be killed." The fifth said, "Oh! We should only kill those who come forward to fight us." Then the sixth robber said, "Leave the killing, we should only take the wealth."

The conclusion is this: The one who said to kill everyone was possessed by the results of Krishna-leshya; the one who said to kill humans was possessed by Neel-leshya; the one who said to kill only men was possessed by Kapotavर्ण-leshya; the one who said to kill only those with weapons was possessed by Tejo-leshya; the one who said to kill those who come forward to fight was possessed by Padma-leshya; and the one who said to only take the wealth was possessed by the results of Shukla-leshya.

## Description of Mind Purification

**Chapter Four, Light of Yoga, Verses 45-48**

In these six Leshyas, the first three are considered unfavorable (A-prashasta) and the last three are favorable (Prashasta). As the soul becomes purer and purer, the Leshyas change. The soul attains a state of existence based on the Leshya it experiences at the time of death. Therefore, the Lord said, "Jalle se marai, talle se uvvjai." This means that the soul is born into the same Leshya in which it dies. Similarly, the Bhagavad Gita and other scriptures say, "Ante cha Bharat Shreshtha! Ya matih, sa gatir nrunam." This means that the state of existence of humans is determined by their final thoughts. The word "mati" used here refers to consciousness. How can the statement "As the thought, so the state of existence" be consistent? If the meaning of "mati" is taken as the result of the most impure state, then the statement of the great sage becomes logical. 

Of the six Leshyas, a soul in the Krishna Leshya goes to hell, a soul in the Neel Leshya goes to the state of stationary beings, a soul in the Kapoth Leshya goes to the state of Tyancha, a soul in the Peet Leshya goes to the state of humans, a soul in the Padm Leshya goes to the state of gods, and a soul in the Shukla Leshya attains liberation. What more can be said? By abandoning the impure Leshyas and accepting the pure Leshyas, the mind can be purified progressively.

**Some scattered methods of mind purification are described as follows:**

**Verse 45:**

**Meaning:** To purify the mind, one should control attachment and aversion, which are the forms of liking and disliking. If attachment and aversion arise, they should be rendered ineffective. By doing so, the soul, free from impurities, resides in its true nature.

**The difficulty of controlling attachment and aversion is explained in three verses:**

**Verse 46:**

**Meaning:** Even those who strive to control their minds, like yogis, are overcome by attachment, aversion, and delusion, which make them foolish and hateful, and bring them under the control of these vices.

**Verse 47:**

**Meaning:** Even while protecting their minds from vices through Yama, Niyama, and other practices, yogis are constantly deceived by attachment, aversion, and other vices, like demons. Just as demons, despite being controlled by mantras and other practices, deceive practitioners when they get an opportunity, similarly, attachment, aversion, and other vices deceive the minds of yogis.

**Verse 48:**

**Meaning:** The mind of a yogi whose knowledge and vision are destroyed by the darkness of attachment, aversion, and other vices is dragged into the well of hell, just as a blind person drags another blind person into a well.

**Meaning:** Darkness covers the light of the eye; similarly, attachment, aversion, and other vices cover the light of the soul's true knowledge and vision. When the knowledge and vision (faith in the truth) of a practitioner are destroyed, the mind, corrupted by vision and knowledge, brings him under its control and throws him into the well of hell. Just as a blind person throws another blind person into a well, similarly, the mind blinded by attachment, aversion, and other vices throws a mentally blind person into the well of hell. This means that a person who is blind to his mind falls into the well of hell.

**Here is the meaning of some internal verses written on this topic:**

Desire, liking, delusion, or attachment to material things is called attachment, and aversion, dislike, hatred, or jealousy towards the same is called aversion. Both attachment and aversion are great bonds for all living beings. They are considered the root and trunk of the tree of all suffering. If there were no attachment and aversion in the world, who would be surprised and delighted to see happiness? Suffering...

## Mind Purity and Means to Protect the Mind from Strong Attachment and Aversion - Means to Destroy Karma

**From the Fourth Light of the Yoga Shastra, verses 49 to 52:**

Who becomes lowly and who does not attain liberation? Everyone attains it. Aversion alone cannot exist without attachment, and attachment alone cannot exist without aversion. By abandoning one, both are abandoned. 

Actions like lust are servants of attachment, and false pride, etc., are the family of aversion. The father, leader, seed, and supreme lord of attachment and aversion, inseparable from both and protected and nurtured by both, is delusion, the grandfather of all vices. Thus, these three vices are the main ones. There is no other vice that cannot be included in these. These three cause all beings in the world to wander in the forest of samsara. 

The soul (jiva) is naturally pure like a crystal, but due to these attachments, it is called the embodiment of attachment. Alas! These thieves of attachment steal the soul's spiritual wealth in the blink of an eye. Due to them, the world is chaotic; or, the soul, situated in its own nature, is robbed of all knowledge by these robbers of attachment in front of its own eyes. 

All the beings in the world and those who are about to attain liberation in a short time are under the control of this ruthless army of delusion. Oh! Vices of attachment! Do you have enmity with liberation or with those seeking liberation that you obstruct their union (ratnatrayamaya)? Only the Arihants are capable of destroying you (vices of attachment). There is no one else as capable. They have extinguished the fire of vices that burns the world. Just as a muni does not fear a tiger, snake, water, or fire when they are nearby, similarly, the muni does not fear the harmful attachment, etc., in both worlds, in this life and in future lives. In fact, a lion of attachment and a tiger of aversion sit with them, because these yogis have chosen the path of great hardship. 

Now, the means to conquer attachment and aversion are explained:

**Verse 49:**

**Meaning:** Therefore, yogi men who desire the state of nirvana should conquer the enemies of attachment and aversion through equanimity, abandoning drowsiness (inattentiveness) and being vigilant.

**Verse 50:**

**Meaning:** Just as bathing in water removes dirt, so too, the dirt of attachment and aversion is quickly removed from men who bathe in the water of equanimity, which is extremely joyful.

**Verse 51:**

**Meaning:** Equanimity destroys in a moment those karmas that a man cannot destroy even by intense austerities for countless births.

**Verse 52:**

**Meaning:** Karma and the soul are intertwined; the virtuous one who has attained certainty about the nature of the soul separates them with the stick of Samayika.

**Explanation:** Karma and the soul are connected; they are separate; they are not one. Thus, the muni who has known this with certainty separates the soul and karma with the stick of Samayika. Just as a stick is used to separate vessels stuck together by adhesive substances, similarly, the soul and karma, which are connected by the bond of association, can be separated by Samayika. This is called the destruction of karma; it is the attainment of the state of nirvana. The complete and total destruction of pudgalas never happens, because substance is eternal. The separation of karma-pudgalas from the soul is called the destruction of karma. 

Here, there is a doubt: "The statement that the virtuous ones separate karmas with the stick of Samayika is only..."

## Description of Equality

**Yoga Shastra, Fourth Light, Verses 53-54**

"It is a verbal delight." This solves the problem that when one practices self-knowledge, with the destruction of the karma that obscures knowledge, one who has thoroughly decided on the nature of the self, who has experienced it, can separate the self, the living being, and karma with the Samayik rod. He repeatedly confirms the self through self-awareness - self-experience - that the karma that covers the nature of the self is different from the self. The same seeker, by the power of the Paramasamayik, separates the living being and karma. || 52 ||

By the power of self-certainty, the seeker not only separates karma, but also shows the self the nature of the Supreme Self. This is called:

|| 379. Ragadi-dhvanta-vidhvanse, krte samayaikamsuna | Svasmin swarupam pasyanti, yoginah paramaatmanah || 53 ||

**Meaning:** When the darkness of attachment, aversion, and delusion is destroyed by the sun of Samayik, yogis see the nature of the Supreme Self in their own self. || 53 ||

**Explanation:** Since they obstruct the nature of the self, attachment, aversion, and delusion are darkness. Their destruction is by the sun of Samayik. Therefore, the nature of the Supreme Self is inherently present in every self; yogis begin to see that nature. In reality, if we consider it, all selves are the nature of the Supreme Self. In every self, only a part of knowledge is present. In the Agamas, the great sages have said: "Savvajivaanam pi anan akkharassaanantbhaago nicchugghhaadio cheva." That is, in all living beings, an infinite part of the letter is always uncovered. (Nandi Sutra 77) It is only because of being contaminated by the defects of attachment, aversion, and delusion that the nature of the Supreme Self does not manifest in the self. When the light of the sun of Samayik shines, the darkness of attachment, aversion, and delusion is removed, and the nature of the Supreme Self manifests in the self. || 53 ||

Now we describe the effect of equality:

|| 380. Snihyanti jantavo nityam vairino'pi parasparam | Api swarthakrte samyabhajah sadhoh prabhavatha || 54 ||

**Meaning:** Although the virtuous practice equality for their own sake, the glory of equality is so wonderful that its effect causes even creatures like snakes and mongooses, who are always enemies, to hold mutual love. || 54 ||

**Explanation:**

The point is that equality has such an effect that even if the virtuous practice equality for their own sake, eternal enemies begin to have mutual friendship. Therefore, learned people praise: "O God! The elephant scratches its cheek with its trunk, pulling the foot of the lion. The snake stands blocking the path of the mongoose. The lion stands ready with its mouth open like a vast cave; but the deer repeatedly sniffs it with trust. Where even such cruel animals become calm, I praise the place of equality - the place of sameness. The scriptures also praise the yogi who is united with equality in this way. Going to yogis removes enmity."

The inner meaning of the verses on this topic is: Equality is that which does not waver in mind between conscious and unconscious matter, between what is desirable and what is undesirable. If someone comes and applies sandalwood paste to the body, or someone pierces the arms with a weapon, yet the mind remains free from attachment and aversion, that is called supreme equality. If someone praises, there is no delight in it, and if someone curses - insults, there is no aversion to it, but the mind remains equal towards both, then that seeker is immersed in equality. There is no need to perform any kind of fire sacrifice, austerity, or charity in this. In fact, this liberation comes only from equality, which is bought without price. What is the benefit of worshipping attachment, aversion, etc., which are difficult to achieve through great effort? Because this beautiful happiness, which is obtained without effort, is given by equality itself. Take refuge in this. The atheist who does not believe in the indirect, will not believe in heaven and liberation; but he will not be able to deny the happiness of equality, which is born of self-experience. Why are you foolish, being engrossed in the talk of poets, in that imagined nectar? O fool! Drink the nectar of equality, which is the taste of self-awareness. The virtuous, who are averse to the tastes that are fit to be eaten, licked, drunk, and sucked,

The Glory of Samata (Equanimity) - 'The Nature of Emotion'
Yoga Shastra, Fourth Light, Verses 55 to 59 | They repeatedly drink the nectar of samata (equanimity) at will. Whether a serpent is wrapped around their neck or a garland of Kalpavriksha flowers is worn; even then, the one who does not experience dislike or liking is the possessor of equanimity. Samata is not some esoteric substance or a fist-shaped instruction given by an Acharya or anything else. For both the child and the scholar, samata is the thirty-first medicine to eradicate the disease of attachment. It is the extremely cruel act of the peaceful yogis that they destroy the family of attachment, etc., with the weapon of samata. This is a sarcastic statement. You too attain this supreme effect of equanimity! Which grants even sinners the highest abode in an instant. The success of the Ratna Tray (three jewels) is in the presence of equanimity, but its absence leads to failure. Salutations to that mighty equanimity! After understanding all the scriptures and their meanings, we shout at the top of our voices and tell you that in this world or the next, there is no one else who can give happiness to oneself or others without equanimity. There is no other remedy for peace than this timely equanimity in the face of adversity or at the time of death. Many beings, skilled in destroying enemies like attachment and aversion, have enjoyed the wealth of the kingdom of samata and attained eternal auspiciousness and the highest position. Therefore, the seeker who desires to make this human birth successful should not be negligent in attaining this samata-equanimity, which is filled with an infinite group of happiness. ||54||
Here there is a doubt that 'equanimity is the cause of the removal of all faults, knowing this we are happy, but if there is any remedy that opposes that equanimity and there is another remedy for the removal of that remedy, and we can do it naturally, then we will be able to experience joy without any desire.' This is solved by thinking in the mind in two verses.
||381|| Samyam syan nirmatven, tatkrite bhavanaah shrayet | Anityatam asharan, bhavam ekattvam anyatam ||55|| ||382|| Ashochamasravavidhim, sanvaram karmanirjaram | Dharmasvakhyatatam lokam, dwadashee bodhibhavanaam ||56|| Meaning: Equanimity is attained through non-attachment, and to attain non-attachment, one should take refuge in twelve emotions.
Those emotions are as follows. ||55-56|| Explanation: The aforementioned equanimity arises from being free from attachment. The question arises, what is the difference between equanimity and non-attachment? The answer is: Equanimity is the opposite of both attachment and aversion; while non-attachment is only the opposite of attachment. Therefore, equanimity is said to be the remedy for both. Therefore, non-attachment, which destroys the powerful attachment, is also included in equanimity. Just as there is a powerful army, if a powerful person is destroyed in it, then it is not difficult to destroy others; similarly, non-attachment is the main reason for the suppression of attachment, which can be used to destroy aversion, etc., for the weak. What more can be said! The remedy for non-attachment is explained. To awaken the feeling of non-attachment, the yogi should take refuge in the emotions of non-attachment. The names of those twelve emotions are as follows: 1. Anitya-bhavana (impermanence), 2. Asharan-bhavana (helplessness), 3. Sansar-bhavana (worldliness), 4. Ekatva-bhavana (oneness), 5. Anyatva-bhavana (otherness), 6. Ashocha-bhavana (impurity), 7. Ashrava-bhavana (influx), 8. Sanvar-bhavana (restriction), 9. Nirjara-bhavana (cessation), 10. Dharmasvakhyata-bhavana (self-knowledge), 11. Lok-bhavana (worldliness), and 12. Bodhidurlabha-bhavana (rarity of enlightenment). These are the twelve emotions. The nature of these 12 emotions will be explained in turn. ||55-56|| Among them, the nature of Anitya-bhavana (impermanence) is explained first. ||383|| Yatpratastan madhyahne, yanmadhyahne na tanishi | Nireekshyate bhave'smin hi!, padarthanaamanityata ||57|| ||384|| Shariram dehinam sarva-purusharth-nibandhanam | Prachand-pavnodbhut-ghanaghan-vinashvaram ||58|| ||385|| Kallol-chapla lakshmee, sangamaah swapnasannibhaah | Vatyavyatikarotokshiptatul-tulyam cha yauvanam ||59|| Meaning: What is seen in the morning is not seen at noon, and what is seen at noon is not seen at night. Therefore, it is a pity that all things in this world are impermanent. ||57|| This body of embodied beings is the basis of all human endeavors. But it too is perishable like clouds driven away by a strong wind. ||58||

## The Nature of Impermanence

**Verse 59:**  
Wealth is as fleeting as the waves of the ocean; the company of loved ones is as ephemeral as a dream; and youth is as unstable as the cotton wool of the silk-cotton tree blown away by a whirlwind.

**Explanation:**  
There are some inner verses related to this. Their meaning is presented here:  
- Afflictions come from all directions, both to oneself and to others.  
- The living being is suffering, trapped in the teeth-like mechanism of Yama (the god of death).  
- The body of a Chakravarti (universal monarch), Indra (king of the gods), etc., is like a thunderbolt. But even they are subject to impermanence. What then can be said of those who have a body as empty as the core of a banana?  
- One who desires to dwell in a body that is empty, is like one who desires to dwell in a body made of dry, withered leaves.  
- No mantra, tantra, or medicine can save the body-bearer who is situated in the mouth of the death-like disease.  
- As lifespan increases, the living being is first overtaken by old age, and then Yama quickly makes him his food.  
- Shame on those living beings who are born! Knowing full well that they are subject to Yama, how can they even take a single morsel of food? What then can be said of their actions?  
- Just as a bubble arises in water and is immediately destroyed, so too the body of a living being is born and destroyed in an instant.  
- Whether rich or poor, king or pauper, learned or ignorant, virtuous or wicked, Yama is the equal destroyer of all. He has no partiality for virtues, nor hatred for vices.  
- Just as a forest fire burns and consumes the entire forest, so too Yama destroys all beings.  
- Even when fascinated by the power of weapons, one cannot doubt that this body can be made safe by any means.  
- Even he who is capable of making Mount Meru his staff and the earth his umbrella, is unable to save himself or others from the jaws of death.  
- No intelligent human being, from an ant to Indra, will ever say, "I will cheat death, who is under the rule of Yama."  
- And O wise one! Understand that youth is also impermanent, for old age, which steals strength and beauty, makes it decrepit.  
- Those women who desired your company in your youth, will spit on you in your old age and will not even come near you.  
- The wealth that the rich have earned with great effort and kept safe without spending, is also destroyed in an instant.  
- The wise have compared wealth to a water bubble or the light of lightning! Just as these things are destroyed in the blink of an eye, so too is wealth destroyed.  
- Separation is always associated with the company of friends, relatives, and loved ones.  
- Thus, one who constantly contemplates impermanence does not grieve at the death of a son.  
- Only the foolish man, who is possessed by the ghost of permanence, weeps when an earthen pot breaks.  
- Therefore, in this world, not only the body, wealth, youth, or relatives of the body-bearers are impermanent, but the entire universe, both conscious and unconscious, is impermanent.  
- The saints say: Only Dharma (righteousness) is permanent.

**Verse 60:**  
Thus, with a steady mind, one should contemplate the impermanent nature of the world every moment, to awaken the feeling of detachment, which is like a mantra to subdue the serpent of desire.

**Verse 61:**  
Alas! When even Indra, Upendra (Vishnu), Vasudeva (Krishna), Chakravarti, and other humans become subject to death, who then is the refuge of living beings in the face of death's terror? Even Indra cannot protect himself at the time of death.

**Verse 62:**  
Even in the presence of father, mother, sister, brother, and son, karma takes the living being, devoid of refuge, to the abode of Yama, the four-gated realm. No one can protect him at that time. In reality, the living being goes to various realms and births in the cycle of existence, according to his karma.

##  The Feeling of Helplessness and the Nature of the World

**Fourth Light of Yoga Shastra, Verses 63 to 65**

**Meaning:**

**389.** Those with foolish minds grieve for their loved ones, being led to the door of death by their own actions. But they do not grieve for themselves, thinking foolishly, "We too will one day become victims of death." || 63 ||

Now we conclude the feeling of helplessness.

**390.** In this world, burning with the blazing flames of the fire of sorrow, there is no refuge for the embodied being, like a fawn in the forest. || 64 ||

**Meaning:** When a lion attacks in the forest, no one can save the fawn; similarly, in this world, burning with the blazing, fierce flames of the fire of sorrow, there is no one to save the being. || 64 ||

**Explanation:** This is the nature of the feeling of helplessness! In this regard, the meaning of some inner verses is presented - Experts in Ashtanga Ayurveda, medicines, or the Mrityunjaya mantra, none can save from death. There is a cage of naked swords all around, and the king is sitting safely surrounded by the four-armed army, yet the servants of Yama forcibly drag him away like a pauper. In the middle of a reservoir, there was a cage built on top of a pillar, in which a king had kept his beloved son safe from death, but even from there, death dragged him away. Then what to say of others? Sagar Chakravarti had sixty thousand sons; but those helpless sons were burnt to ashes like straw in an instant by the blazing Dev. In front of Skanda Acharya's eyes, his five hundred disciples were being ground to death by the Yama-like guardian priest in a mill, and there was no one to give them refuge. Just as an animal does not know how to counteract death, so too does a scholar not know how to counteract death. Shame on such foolishness! There have been such powerful men in the world who have made the whole world free from thorns with the strength of their swords, but those very warriors would tremble with fear and bite their tongues when they saw Yama's furrowed brow. Indra, who lovingly embraced him and seated him on half his throne, even the king Shrenik became helpless in the end. Such a plight befell him that he could not even be heard. The holy monks who walked on the edge of a sword, who followed the great vows, who had not committed any sin in their lives, were also unable to counteract death. In reality, this world is helpless, chaotic, orphaned, leaderless, no one can counteract death in it. It is becoming Yama's morsel. Dharma Kriya is considered to be a form of counteraction, but even that is not a counteraction to death. It is considered to be the giver of good fortune or the doer of good fortune. Thus, in all three worlds, the terrible Yama, without fear, does not tire of devouring the entire world, filled with all beings from Brahma to ants. It is a pity that the whole world is troubled by this. Therefore, take refuge in Dharma. Thus, the feeling of helplessness is described. || 64 ||

Now the nature of the world is explained in three verses.

**391.** The Vedic scholar, the scavenger, the master, the creator Brahma, and the worm, all are the same. In this world, like a play, the worldly being acts like an actor! || 65 ||

**Meaning:** Alas, in this world, which is like a playhouse, the worldly being acts like an actor, performing various acts. Sometimes he becomes a Vedic scholar, sometimes a scavenger, sometimes a servant, sometimes the creator Brahma, and sometimes a worm. || 65 ||

**Meaning:** Just as a playwright comes on stage in different costumes, so too does the worldly being, due to the different karmic titles, takes on various bodies and comes on the stage of the world and acts out his part. The one who was a Vedic Brahmin, becomes a scavenger according to his karma, and the one who was a master, is born as a servant after death.

---------------------------
The world is a strange place, full of suffering and the cycle of rebirth.  The fourth chapter of the Yoga Shastra, verses 66 and 67, tell us that even Prajapati, the creator, was born as an insect.  This is a testament to the strange nature of the world.  But from the perspective of the soul, this is not its true form. ||65||

392.  The soul, bound by karma, wanders through all the realms of existence, like a tenant in a rented house.  It enters and leaves each realm, never staying in one place for long. ||66||

Meaning:  The soul is born and dies in all realms of existence.  From the one-sense beings to the five-sense beings, there is no realm in the 84 lakh yonis of this world that the soul has not experienced.  Just as a householder rents a hut and leaves it when he no longer needs it, so too does the soul, bound by karma, take on a body for a time, but then leaves it after experiencing its karma and takes on another.  In time, it leaves that realm as well, never staying in one place for long. ||66||

392.  There is not a single speck of space in the entire universe that has not been touched by the soul, in its various forms, as it is born and dies, driven by its karma. ||67||

Explanation:  There are two types of space:  loka-akasha and a-loka-akasha.  Loka-akasha is the space where the six substances of dharma-stikaya, adharma-stikaya, akasha, kala, pudgala, and jiva are present.  A-loka-akasha is the space where these substances are not present.  It is said that the realm where the substances of dharma-stikaya, etc., are present is called loka, and the realm where they are not present is called a-loka.  The soul, in its various forms, from the one-sense beings to the five-sense beings, is born and dies according to its karma.  There is no intervention from God or any other force.  Other philosophers have said that the ignorant soul is unable to experience the fruits of its karma, which are happiness and suffering, and therefore it is guided by God to heaven or hell.  But if we accept the intervention of God and the independence of karma, then the diverse forms of the universe would not exist.  And if we accept that these forms are dependent on karma, then God would be powerless and ineffective.  Therefore, karma is the driving force behind the soul's journey to heaven, hell, and other realms.  There is no need to bring God into the equation.  As we have said in the Vitaragastotra, if we accept God as the one who makes us experience the fruits of our karma, then he would not be independent, like us.  And if we accept that the diversity of the world is due to karma, then what is the purpose of bringing in a powerless (impotent) God?

Here are some of the inner meanings of these verses:

The suffering of hell:  The soul, bound by karma, suffers in the realms of hell, animal life, human life, and the gods.  Of these, the realm of hell is where the soul experiences the most suffering.  There are four types of hell:  the first three are characterized by heat, the fourth by both heat and cold, and the last three by cold.  The suffering of hell is determined by the location of the hell.  In the hells where there is both heat and cold, if a mountain of iron were to fall, it would melt before it reached the ground, or it would freeze or shatter.  The beings in hell constantly torment each other, remembering their past hatreds, or they are tormented by the righteous gods.  The beings in hell experience all three types of suffering, and they dwell on the earth of hell.  The beings in hell are born in the womb of a pot, and then the righteous asuras pull them out through a small hole, like a needle through a hole.  Just as a washerman twists clothes on a stone, so too do the righteous asuras twist the limbs of the beings in hell on a stone with sharp thorns.  Just as a piece of wood is split with an axe, so too are the beings in hell split with a terrible axe.  Just as sesame seeds are ground in a mill, so too are the beings in hell ground in a mill.

## The Sufferings of the Tiryanchagati

**The Sufferings of the Narakas:**

Just as described in the Yoga Shastra, Chapter 4, verse 67, the Narakas are ground in a mill. When they are thirsty, they are thrown into the Vaitarani River, which is filled with boiling hot molten glass or copper. When they want to escape the sun, they are taken to the shade of the Asivan tree, where leaves as sharp as swords fall on them, cutting their bodies into hundreds of pieces, each as small as a sesame seed. They are reminded of their past lives, where they engaged in sexual misconduct with other people's wives, and are forced to embrace the branches of the Salmali tree, which are covered in sharp thorns like vajras, and hot iron dolls. They are reminded of the meat they ate in their past lives, and are fed with their own flesh, cut piece by piece. They are reminded of their past lives where they drank alcohol, and are forced to drink boiling hot molten glass. They are roasted over fire, thrown like clubs, pierced with sharp spears, cooked in a pot, fried in boiling oil, roasted like chickpeas on hot sand, and subjected to thousands of other tortures. These sinful Narakas suffer endlessly in hell, crying and lamenting. Cruel and violent birds like herons and crows tear their bodies apart with their beaks. Their eyes and other senses are pulled out. Their limbs, separated from their bodies, rejoin. In this way, the Narakas suffer great pain and are deprived of even a shred of happiness. They remain in hell for a long time, ranging from ten thousand years to thirty-three Sagaropama years.

**The Sufferings of the Tiryanchagati:**

When a being is born into the Tiryanchagati, many of them take the form of a one-sense being, with a body made of earth. They are dug up with tools like ploughs, crushed under the feet of elephants and horses, drenched in water, burned by fire, tormented by salt, alkali, urine, and other corrosive substances, destroyed in boiling water, baked in the ovens of potters, cooked into pots, bricks, and other objects, turned into mud, and baked into mud bricks. They are heated in fire when gold is melted, and they are struck by hard stones. They are cut by the swift currents of rivers, and they fall apart as mountains. When they are born as an Apkayik, they are scorched by the sun's rays, frozen into ice, dried in the dust, and die when they are mixed with various types of water, boiled in pots, or drunk by thirsty beings. The Agnicayik beings are killed by water and other substances, injured by thunderbolts, and burned by fuel and other things. They suffer pain in the form of being burned, injured, and killed. The Vayukayik beings are killed by fans and other things, and they die constantly due to the combination of cold and hot substances. They are tormented by winds from all directions, including the winds from the mouth, nose, and other parts of the body. They are eaten by snakes and other creatures. The Vanaspatikayik beings are killed by ten types of things: piercing, digestion by fire, friction, being cut, beaten, being sprinkled with alkali, being burned with fire, being fried in boiling oil and water, being burned to ashes by fire, being uprooted by the swift currents of rivers, being broken by storms, and being eaten by other beings. All types of plants are food for all beings. They are constantly tormented by all types of weapons. The two-sense beings suffer from cold, heat, rain, fire, and other things. They are crushed underfoot, eaten by chickens and other birds, swallowed with water, killed by shells, squeezed by leeches, and killed by medicines that are given to kill worms in the stomach. The three-sense beings, such as lice, bedbugs, and fleas, are crushed, pressed, and killed by ants, brooms, and other things. They are trapped in mud, burned by the sun or hot water, and crushed by mats and other things. The four-sense beings, such as flies, mosquitoes, and other creatures, are destroyed by many causes. People who collect honey from bees and wasps throw stones and other things at them. They are killed by fans and other things. Flies, spiders, and other creatures are eaten by lizards.

## The Sorrows of Human and Divine Existence

**Chapter 4, Verse 67 of the Yoga Shastra**

**The Sorrows of the Animal Realm:**

Goats and other animals are eaten. Aquatic creatures with five senses often swallow each other. The saying "fish swallowing fish" is well-known. In the ocean, large fish swallow small fish. Fishermen catch fish in the water with nets, herons eat them, some skin them, cook their flesh and eat it, others kill them for their fat. On land, weak deer and other animals are eaten by strong, flesh-hungry lions, cheetahs, wolves, etc. Hunters, poachers, those who enjoy hunting or are flesh-hungry or fond of sport, inflict violence on many creatures. Poor land animals have to endure hunger, thirst, cold, heat, carrying excessive loads, being beaten, and being scolded with whips, goads, etc. They have to endure such pain. Birds that fly in the sky, like parrots, pigeons, eagles, sparrows, partridges, etc., are eaten by birds of prey, vultures, cats, etc. Flesh-hungry butchers, hunters, etc., catch them using various methods, inflicting various kinds of torture, and kill them. Poor animals are always afraid of water, fire, weapons, etc. They often die bound and enslaved. How can we describe the many sorrows they experience due to their own karmic bonds?

**The Sorrows of the Human Realm:**

In the human realm, a human born in an uncivilized land commits so many sins that it is impossible to even describe them. Even those born in civilized lands, many become Chandala, Mlechchha, Bhangi, butcher, prostitute, etc., and earn many sins and experience sorrow. Even those born in the Aryan lineage, by acting like uncivilized people, experience sorrow, poverty, and burn in the flames of misfortune. Seeing others with more wealth and themselves with less, or feeling resentment in their hearts due to being enslaved by others or working for them, humans live in sorrow. Surrounded by sorrows like disease, old age, death, loss of loved ones, or becoming infamous due to low deeds, humans live in a pitiful and sorrowful state. Old age, disease, death, or slavery are not as painful as hell or the womb. The pain experienced by a being when it exits the womb is truly infinite times greater than the pain of being in the womb. In childhood, humans are covered in feces and urine, they play in it. In youth, they engage in sexual activity, and in old age, they are afflicted with respiratory diseases, asthma, cough, etc. They are not ashamed, even though they are like pigs eating excrement in childhood, like lustful donkeys in youth, and like old bulls in old age, not remaining in human form. Humans see their mother's face in childhood, a young woman's face in youth, and their children's faces in old age, but they do not see their inner self, their true self. Driven by the desire for wealth, humans are engrossed in farming, jobs, business, animal husbandry, etc., and waste their lives. Sometimes they steal, sometimes they gamble, sometimes they engage in evil with the wicked. In this way, humans adopt the causes for repeated transmigration in the world. Blinded by delusion, humans end their lives indulging in sensual pleasures when happy, and in misery and weeping when unhappy, but they do not understand the path of righteousness. This means that the soul, capable of destroying an infinite number of karmic aggregates, even after attaining humanhood, becomes sinful by committing sins. Having obtained the human body, the foundation of the three jewels of knowledge, vision, and character, they fill it with sin, like filling a golden vessel with wine. Like a crow throwing away a gem to chase after a bird, they lose their precious human life, even though they have received it, like a rare gem, more valuable than the Chintamani, a wish-fulfilling gem, in the ocean of existence. Even after attaining humanhood, an extraordinary cause for attaining heaven and liberation, humans engage in actions that lead to hell. Even the gods of the Uttara-Vimana, who strive with great effort to obtain humanhood, use this human life for sin when they obtain it. The sorrows of hell are indirect, but the sorrows of birth and death are direct. How can we describe them in detail?

**The Sorrows of the Divine Realm:**

Even among intelligent gods, who are under the sway of sorrow, anger, despair, envy, and misery, sorrow reigns supreme. Seeing the great prosperity of another, knowing their own meager good deeds earned in past lives, gods grieve for a long time. If another powerful god is after them and they are unable to retaliate, they experience sorrow.

##  The Feeling of Oneness

**Verse 68 of the Fourth Light of Yoga Shastra:**

When a deva, under the influence of intense anger, constantly suffers in his mind, thinking, "I did not perform any good deeds in my previous birth, which is why I have become a servant of others here, a deva who obeys others." Seeing the increasing prosperity of others, the deva burns with envy throughout his life. When he is robbed of his wealth, loses all his prosperity, he adopts a humble attitude and cries out in a choked voice, "Oh Lord of life! Oh Master! Oh Deva! Be pleased with me!" Even though the devas like Kandarpa attained heaven through virtuous deeds, they are still afflicted by lust, anger, and fear there. They do not find their true place. Seeing the signs of being expelled from the heavenly realm, the deva laments, "I don't know where I will be born after being expelled from here." In this way, the deva's face wilts like the never-ending garland of flowers on the Kalpavriksha tree when it withers. His entire body structure becomes weak, and even the Kalpavriksha, which does not tremble even from the strongest force, begins to shake. It is as if beauty and shame have committed a crime together in the midst of a famine, with the accepted beloved. In this way, knowing the deva to be guilty, the goddess leaves him. The pure beauty of his clothes also fades in an instant. Just as the sky turns dark due to the sudden appearance of clouds, the deva's face becomes black and dull due to sin. Those who were previously devoid of humility become humble, those who were sleepless become drowsy. Just as ants get wings at the time of death, similarly, humility and drowsiness engulf the devas at the time of their expulsion. By transgressing the law of justice, he becomes excessively attached to worldly pleasures and desires to indulge in evil deeds. Knowing that he will face a terrible fate in the future, his body starts to break down at the joints, even though he is healthy, due to the pain he experiences. His sharp intellect, which was adept at understanding things quickly, suddenly disappears. Now he is unable to even see the prosperity of others. The fear of the suffering of being born in the womb, which is about to befall him in the near future, makes him shiver. He frightens others by trembling his limbs. Knowing for sure that his expulsion is imminent, he loses interest in his celestial chariot, Nandana garden, or well. They all seem like an embrace of fire to him. He constantly laments day and night, "Oh my beloved! Alas! My chariot! Oh! My well! Oh! Kalpavriksha! When will I see you again after my divinity ends? Ah! Your laughter, like nectar! Oh! Your lips, red like nectar! Oh! Your voice, flowing like nectar! Ha! My beloved, like nectar! Alas! The pillars adorned with jewels! Alas! The touch of jewels! Oh! The platform made of jewels! Who will you shelter now? Alas! This well, adorned with lotuses and water lilies, with its steps made of jewels, who will it benefit? Oh Parijat! Oh Mandara! Oh offspring! Oh Harichandan! Oh Kalpavriksha! Will you all leave me? Oh! Will I have to live in the hell of a woman's womb, in servitude? Alas! Will I have to taste the foul taste of food there again and again? Will I have to suffer the pain of roasting myself in the fire of my stomach, according to my deeds? Where are those celestial women, like repositories of love, and where are those foul, human women, dripping with impurities?" In this way, the deva keeps remembering the things of the heavenly realm and keeps lamenting. And as he keeps lamenting, his life's lamp suddenly goes out in an instant. ||67||

In this way, worldly beings in all four realms do not have even a little happiness in this world. Not only that, but there is also a lot of physical and mental suffering. Understanding this, if you want to be free forever from the fear of wandering in the cycle of birth and death, then abandon attachment and constantly meditate on the feeling of the world with pure intentions. In this way, the feeling of the world is complete.

Now, the feeling of oneness is explained in two verses. ||394||

One is born alone, one dies alone. One experiences the karmas accumulated in previous births. ||68||

**Meaning:** This being is born alone and helpless, and it dies alone, leaving its body. And it alone experiences the karmas accumulated in birth after birth. ||8||

Shri Bhagwan has said, "The karmas performed in the afterlife have to be experienced in this world; similarly, the karmas performed in this world are also experienced in this world." ||356||

## Otherness Meditation

**• Yoga Shastra, Fourth Light, Verses 69-71. 395.**

**Wealth earned by others is enjoyed by many, but the one who earned it suffers alone in the depths of hell due to his own actions.** 69.

**Meaning:** The wealth earned by someone through great efforts and accumulation is enjoyed by others - relatives, family, servants, etc. But the one who earned that wealth suffers alone in the depths of hell due to his own bad deeds. 69.

**Explanation:** The meaning of the inner verses related to this is presented here: This soul, bound by karma, wanders alone in the vast forest of the world, which is engulfed by the fire of suffering. No relative, friend, or loved one can help or share in the journey. The question arises: Is this body, which experiences pleasure and pain, a helper? The answer is no; this body did not come with the soul from a previous life, nor will it go with it in the next life. How can it be a helper then? Your belief that dharma and adharma are the only helpers is also not true. Because there is no help from dharma or adharma in liberation. Therefore, the soul, performing good and bad deeds, wanders alone in the world; and experiences the fruits of those deeds accordingly. It also attains the supreme liberation alone. There is no connection or help from any relative there. Therefore, the soul experiences the suffering in the world and the happiness attained in liberation alone, without any help or share from anyone. Even a lone swimmer can cross the vast ocean quickly, but if his chest, arms, and legs are tied together, or if he carries any other possessions, he cannot cross. Therefore, only by being detached from wealth, body, etc. (from attachment), can the solitary, healthy soul cross the ocean of the world. By committing sins, the soul goes to hell alone; similarly, by performing virtuous deeds, it goes to heaven alone, and by destroying both sin and virtue, it attains liberation alone. Understanding this, one should meditate on the oneness of the soul for a long time to attain detachment. Thus ends the meditation on oneness. 69.

**Now we explain the nature of otherness meditation.** 396.

**Where the body is different from the soul, due to its difference in form, and wealth, relatives, and helpers are also different, then it is not wrong to say that there is otherness.** 70.

**Meaning:** Where the soul and body are different - the supported and the supporter, the formless and the formed, the conscious and the unconscious (inert), the eternal and the non-eternal; and the body does not go with the soul in the next life, while the soul remains even in the next life. From this, the difference - the dissimilarity - between the body and the soul is clearly evident. Then it is not wrong to say that wealth, relatives, parents, friends, servants, wife, children, etc., and so-called helpers are different (from the soul). 70.

**Meaning:** When the body is accepted as different from the soul, then what is the objection in considering material things (which are mostly related to the body) as different?

**The fruit of otherness meditation is only detachment, but there are other fruits as well; we will explain them.** 397.

**One who sees his soul as different from the body, wealth, relatives, and friends, how can he be terrified or afflicted by the nail of sorrow born from separation from the soul?** 71.

**Meaning:** How can one whose soul sees itself as different from the body, wealth, relatives, and friends be terrified or afflicted by the nail of sorrow born from separation from the soul? 71.

**Explanation:** The meaning of the inner verses used in this context is being presented: Otherness means difference. That difference is clearly evident between the soul and the body, wealth, relatives, etc. There is a doubt here: Material things can be known through the senses, while the soul is the subject of experience. How can there be oneness between them? Thus, when the difference between the soul and the body, etc., is clear, why does the soul feel pain when the body is struck? The solution is this: The person who does not have the understanding of the difference between the soul and the body, etc., who considers them both as one, will surely feel pain in the soul when the body is struck. But the one who has understood the difference between the body and the soul, etc., will not feel pain in the soul when the body is struck.

##  Impure Thoughts and Influx of Karma

**Chapter 4, Verses 72-74 of the Yoga Shastra**

He who has fully understood the difference between impure thoughts and the influx of karma, does not experience pain in his soul even when his body is struck. The Tirthankara, the Supreme Being, Lord Mahavira, endured many hardships for 12 years. Sangamdev threw the Kalchakra at him, and the cowherds poured cooked rice on his feet. Yet, the Lord, who experienced the body as distinct from the soul, did not experience sorrow in his soul.

Namiraja, the knower of the distinction between body and soul, was in Mithila when the city was burning. Devendra said to him, "Your Mithila is burning." Namiraja replied, "Nothing of mine is burning." He who understands this distinction, even if he experiences sorrow related to his father, does not become sorrowful. However, if sorrow befalls his servant, he experiences sorrow because of his attachment and possessiveness. Knowing that "even a son is not his own, but another," he accepts the servant as his own, and thus feels greater affection for him than for his son.

Just as a royal treasurer keeps another's wealth separate, so too, you, the blessed soul, should understand this and abandon false thoughts. Continuously embrace the feeling of otherness, which cuts away attachment. Thus, the feeling of otherness is perfected. 71.

Now, we speak about impure thoughts.

**Verse 72:**

**Meaning:** After eating, it becomes rasa (juice), from rasa comes blood, from blood comes flesh, from flesh comes fat, from fat comes marrow, from marrow comes semen, from semen comes intestines, and from intestines comes excrement. Thus, this body is a receptacle of impure substances. How then can this body be considered pure?

**Verse 73:**

**Meaning:** To those who consider the body pure, we say: Two eyes, two ears, two nostrils, a mouth, an anus, and a penis - these are the nine openings in a man's body, and twelve in a woman's. From these, constantly flows filth (foul, disgusting matter), which clings to the body. To imagine purity in such a foul body is the very irony of great delusion.

**Inner Verses:**

The body, born from semen and menstrual blood, nourished by the essence of excrement, and covered in the womb by a thin membrane, how can it be pure? Nourished by the rasa (juice) that flows through the nerves, produced from the food, water, and drinks consumed by the mother, who would consider this body pure? Filled with impurities and the waste of the elements, a place for worms, earthworms, and other creatures, with disease-ridden serpents coiled around it, who would call this body pure? Even if fragrant substances like sandalwood, camphor, musk, and cardamom are ground and applied to cleanse it, they too become soiled after a while. How then can this body be pure? If you chew fragrant betel and sleep at night, and smell your mouth in the morning, you will find a foul odor. How then can this body be considered pure? Even naturally fragrant scents, incense, and garlands of flowers become foul when they come into contact with the body. How then can this body be called pure? Like a dirty wine jar, this body cannot be purified even by hundreds of oil massages or by washing it with millions of jars of water. Those who say that the body is purified by earth, water, air, or sunlight should be considered fools. This is like saying that a physician can be made by drawing lines on the ground. Only by cultivating detachment towards the body through the feeling of impurity can a seeker overcome the great burden of lust, pride, and attachment. What more can be said? This is the feeling of impurity. 73.

**Verse 74:**

**Meaning:** The activities of the mind, speech, and body are called yoga (actions). Through these yogas, the influx of karma occurs in beings, and thus they are called asravas (influxes).

## The Nature of Asrava (Inflow)

**Chapter 4, Light 74-78 of the Yoga Shastra**

**Verse 74:**  Auspicious and inauspicious karmas are attracted from all sides. Therefore, these (yogas) are called 'Asrava'.

**Explanation:** The embodied soul, through all its self-regions, receives auspicious and inauspicious karmas for mental contemplation. It also develops a sense of dependence. In this regard, the soul has to exert special effort, which is called manoyoga (mental yoga). It is for the five-sense being. The embodied soul, through verbal yoga, receives and releases karmas. The soul acquires the ability to act through this verbality. Through this verbal action, the soul gains the power of speech, which is called vachanayoga (verbal yoga). It is for the two-sense being. The meaning of 'kaya' (body) is the dwelling place of the soul. Through kaya yoga, the being experiences the results of its actions, which is called kayayoga (physical yoga). Through the combination of mind, speech, and body, the soul experiences yoga in the form of karma, just as fire turns bricks red. It is also said that 'viriya' (energy), 'sthama' (steadiness), 'utsaha' (enthusiasm), 'parakrama' (effort), 'cheshta' (activity), 'shakti' (power), and 'samartha' (ability) are all synonyms for yoga. This yoga is a helpful aid to the being, like a stick for a weak or old person. The transformation of karmas suitable for the mind into the self-region is manoyoga; the transformation of karmas suitable for speech into the form of verbality and eloquence is vachanayoga; and the transformation of karmas suitable for the body into the form of actions like walking is kayayoga. This yoga is of two types: auspicious and inauspicious. It gives rise to saataavedaniya (perceptible) and asaataavedaniya (imperceptible) karmas. Therefore, it is called asrava. That which causes the inflow of karmas into the soul is called asrava. That which causes the inflow of auspicious and inauspicious karmas is called yoga, because it leads to corresponding actions.

**Verse 75:** Therefore, with discernment, these are considered the causes of auspicious and inauspicious karmas. The mind, imbued with the four emotions of friendliness, joy, compassion, and equanimity, generates auspicious karmas. This leads to saataavedaniya, right faith, laughter, pleasure, knowledge of men, auspicious lifespan, auspicious name, and auspicious lineage. However, the same mind, when overwhelmed by passions like anger and sense objects, generates inauspicious karmas. This leads to asaataavedaniya and other such karmas.

**Verse 76:** For the generation of auspicious karmas, one should speak words that are in accordance with the twelve-limbed Ganipitaka, the form of scriptural knowledge. Conversely, for the generation of inauspicious karmas, one should know words that are contrary to scriptural knowledge.

**Verse 77:** The embodied being, with a body protected from vices and wrong actions, accumulates auspicious karmas. However, the same being, with a body that is constantly engaged in harmful actions or killing beings, accumulates inauspicious karmas.

**Explanation:** The activity of the body, protected from wrong tendencies, or the state of kayotsarga (body release), is kayayoga. Through such kayayoga, the being accumulates saataavedaniya and other auspicious (virtuous) karmas. However, the being with a body that is constantly engaged in harmful actions or killing beings accumulates asaataavedaniya and other inauspicious (sinful) karmas. The conclusion is that auspicious and inauspicious yogas give rise to auspicious and inauspicious karmas. This explanation does not contradict the cause-and-effect relationship. The statement, "auspicious yoga makes the body the cause of auspicious results," is mentioned here in passing. In the section on emotions, the cause of inauspicious results through inauspicious yoga should also be explained to generate detachment. Even without mentioning it, the accumulation of inauspicious causes is understood.

**Verse 78:** Passions, sense objects, yoga, carelessness, lack of restraint, false belief, suffering, and anger are the causes of inauspicious karmas.

##  Asrava Bhavana Swaroop - Eight Karma's Asrava Hetu

**Yoga Shastra Chaturth Prakash Shlok 78 Meaning:**  Kshaya, five senses' objects, ashubha yoga, pramad, aviriti, mithyatva and aarta-raudradhyan; all these are the causes of ashubha karma bandhan. ||78||

**Explanation:**  Four kshayas - krodh, maan, maya, lobha; nine nokshayas - hasya, rati, arati, bhay, shok, jugupsa, purushved, strived and napunsakved related to kshayas; desire for 23 objects of five senses; three yogas - man-vachan; eight types of pramad - agyan, sanshay-vipaye, rag-dvesh, smritibhramsh, disrespect towards dharma, bad tendencies in yogas; aviriti - non-rejection of sin; mithyadarshan; aartadhyan and raudradhyan. All these are the causes of ashubha karma's arrival (asrava).

Here, the question arises that all these (above mentioned) are said to be the causes of bandhan. As, Vaachakmukhya Shri Umaswati has said in Tattvarth Sutra 8/1 - Mithyadarshanaaviritipramadakshayayoga bandhetava: i.e. mithyatva, aviriti, pramad, kshaya and ashubha yoga are the causes of karma bandhan. Then why are these bandhetu called asrava hetu in asrava bhavana, not as bandhetu?

In response, it can be said that your question is valid. Mahapurushas have mentioned these in asrava bhavana only, not as bandha bhavana. Asrava bhavana can only be understood; because karma pudgal, which is received by asrava, is called bandhan when it gets connected with the soul. Therefore, it is further said in Tattvarth Sutra 8/2-3 - Sakshayatvaajjeevah karmaano yogyaan pudgalanaadatte sa bandhah: i.e. the soul with kshaya receives karma-worthy pudgals, it is called bandhan. Therefore, there is no intention to differentiate between bandhan and asrava here.

Then, this doubt arises that the merging of karma pudgals with the soul like milk and water is called bandhan; then why is asrava not called bandhan? The solution is - although your point is valid, how can karma pudgals, which are not received by asrava, be included in bandhan? Therefore, there is no fault in making asrava, which is the cause of receiving karma pudgals, the cause of bandhan.

Then, the question arises that then the above mentioned five should be called asrava hetu, calling them bandhetu is useless! In response, it is said that it is not so. Here, bandhan and asrava are mentioned from the perspective of unity. In reality, this text is about asrava hetu; therefore, everyone should understand it in its true form.

Here, the meaning of antaralokas is presented - it is called asrava due to the reception of karma pudgals. There are 8 types of karma - jnanaavaraneya, etc.

These are the asrava hetu of jnanaavaraneya and darshanavaraneya karma - to obstruct (hinder) the attainment of knowledge and vision in the form of qualities and qualities possessing these qualities, to eliminate them, to criticize and discourage them, to kill them, to be envious or jealous of them.

These are the asrava hetu of sataavedaniya (punya) karma - devpuja, guru-seva, supatra daan, daya, kshama, sanayamaasanyam, deshaviriti, not being stained by karma, balatap etc.

These are the asrava hetu of asataavedaniya (paap) karma - to be unhappy oneself, to make others unhappy, to grieve - to make others grieve, to kill, to torture, to lament (cry) and to regret - to make others regret good deeds.

These are the asrava hetu of darshanamohaniya karma - to criticize vitrag, shrutigyan, sangh, dharma and all gods, to speak ill of sarvagya, siddha paramatma and ahantdev or gods due to the result of intense mithyatva, to deny them, to deny their existence, to accuse righteous men, to preach or speak of the wrong path, to insist on evil, to worship - to honor the unrestrained, to act without prior consideration and to insult guru etc. It is very difficult for such people to attain samyagdarshan.

Kshaya hetu of charitra mohaniya karma - due to the rise of kshaya, there is intense result (passion) of krodh etc. in the soul, due to which the soul does not attain charitraratna.

Hasya mohaniya nokshaya asrava hetu - to make fun, to make obscene jokes, to have a habit of making fun, to talk too much, to speak in a humble tone etc.

Ratinokashaya - asrava hetu - eagerness to see new villages, countries, cities etc., fondness for seeing obscene pictures etc.

## The Nature of Sanvara-Bhavana

**The twenty stages (tapas) of worship of the Tirthankara-namakarma asrava are:**

* **Samvara-bhavana:** The nature of Samvara-bhavana
* **Yoga-shastra:** The fourth light, verses 79 to 83
* **Essential vows and conduct:** Maintaining vigilance in essential vows and conduct
* **Vinya:** Humility
* **Jnana-abhyasa:** Practice of knowledge
* **Tap:** Austerity
* **Tyaga:** Renunciation
* **Dhyana:** Meditation repeatedly
* **Tirtha-pravahana:** Pilgrimage
* **Sangha-samadhi:** Concentration in the Sangha
* **Sadhu-seva (Vyayavritti):** Service to the holy ones
* **Apuurva-naveen-gyan-grahan:** Acquiring new and unique knowledge
* **Darshan-vishuddhi:** Purity of vision

**The first Tirthankara, Shri Rishabhdev Bhagwan, and the last Tirthankara, Bhagwan Mahavira Swami, practiced all twenty stages of tapas. The remaining Tirthankaras practiced one, two, three, or all of these stages.**

**The asrava of Gotra-karma:**

* **Causes:** Slandering others, making fun of them, showing disrespect, neglecting their virtues, pointing out their faults (whether they exist or not), praising oneself (whether one has virtues or not), hiding one's own faults, and taking pride in one's caste or lineage.
* **These are the causes of the asrava of the low Gotra-namakarma.**
* **The opposite of these, such as being free from pride, being humble in thought, word, and deed, are the causes of the asrava of the high Gotra.**

**The asrava of Antarayakarma:**

* **Causes:** Obstructing others in their efforts to gain wealth, power, strength, enjoyment, and consumption, whether with reason or without.
* **This asrava can sometimes be auspicious, but otherwise, it prevents beings from attaining dispassion.**
* **Therefore, knowing the asrava to be inauspicious, the bhavya-jiva should contemplate the asrava-bhavana to cultivate detachment.**

**Now, we will explain the nature of Samvara-bhavana:**

**Verse 79:**

* **"Sarvesham asravaanam tu, nirodhah sanvarah smritah. Sa punar bhidyate dvedha, dravya-bhaava-vibhedatah."**
* **Meaning:** Restraining all the asravas is called Samvara. This happens only in the ayogee kevalis. This statement is in relation to Sarva-samvara. Restraining one, two, three, or more asravas is called Desha-samvara. Sarva-samvara occurs in the fourteenth gunasthanaka, called Ayogee-kevali. Both Sarva-samvara and Desha-samvara have two divisions each, based on dravya and bhaava.

**Verse 80:**

* **"Yah karma-pudgaladaan-chhedah, sa dravya-sanvarah. Bhava-hetu-kriya-tyagah, sa punar bhaava-sanvarah."**
* **Meaning:** Preventing the inflow of karma-pudgalas through the asrava-door is called dravya-samvara. Renouncing the actions that are the cause of existence is called bhaava-sanvara.

**Verse 81:**

* **"Yena yena hyupaayena, rudhyate yo yo asravaah. Tasya tasya nirodhaaya sa sa yojyo manishibhih."**
* **Meaning:** Wise men should employ those means by which each asrava can be restrained.

**Verse 82:**

* **"Kshamaya mrudubhaavena, rijutvenaapyaneeyaya. Krodham maanam tatha maaya, lobham rundhyad yathakramam."**
* **Meaning:** The yogi who strives to attain self-control should restrain anger with forgiveness, pride with humility, deceit with honesty, and greed with contentment.

**Verse 83:**

* **"Asanyama-krtotshekaan, vishayan visha-sannibhaan. Nirakuryaad akhandena, sanaymena mahaamatih."**
* **Meaning:** The great wise one should restrain the objects of sense, which are like poison, with unbroken self-control, as they are intensified by lack of self-control.

**Meaning:**

* The enjoyment of sensual pleasures seems sweet at the time, but in the end, it is like poison.
* Therefore, the power of the senses, which are intoxicated by touch and other objects, can only be restrained by unbroken self-control.

##  Sanvara Bhavana and Nirjara Bhavana

**Now, the opposite of Yoga, Pramada and Aviriti is explained.**

**Verse 84:**

> **Meaning:**  By the three types of secrecy (guarding the mind, speech and body), one should establish the opposite of Pramada, which is Apramada (non-negligence), in relation to the five types of Pramada (intoxication, indulgence in sense objects, passions, sleep, and idle talk) or the eight types of Pramada (ignorance, doubt, wrong perception, attachment, aversion, forgetfulness, disrespect for Dharma, and wrong tendencies in Yoga). And by abandoning Yoga that involves sinful actions, one should establish Aviriti (non-restlessness) through Viriti (restlessness).

**Now, the opposite of Mithyatva and Artha-Roudra Dhyana is explained.**

**Yoga Shastra, Fourth Light, Verses 84 to 86**

**Verse 85:**

> **Meaning:** One should conquer Mithyatva (false belief) through Samyag Darshan (right faith) and conquer Artha-Roudra Dhyana (meditation with worldly desires) through the stability of the mind in the form of Dharma Dhyana (meditation on Dharma) and Shukla Dhyana (meditation on purity). Who should do this? The Yogi who strives for Sanvara (purification) should do this.

**The meaning of the inner verses related to this is explained.**

**Explanation:**

> Just as dust enters a house with many doors and windows that are not closed, and if the inner walls, windows, or doors are oiled and smooth, the dust sticks to them and becomes one with them. But if the doors are closed, the dust cannot enter and cannot stick to the oil. Or, imagine a pond. If all the ways for water to enter are open, the water enters quickly. But if the entrances are closed, no water can enter. Just as a boat with a hole in it fills with water, but if the hole is closed, no water can enter, similarly, if the three types of Yoga, which are like the doors of Asrava (influx of karma), are stopped from all sides, then the Karmic matter cannot enter the soul, which is in the form of Sanvara (purification). This means that Sanvara stops the doors of Asrava. And Sanvara is of many types, such as Kshama (forgiveness), etc. The one who has achieved Sanvara is called by the name of that Sanvara. Then, the Sanvara that occurs in that Gunasthan (stage of spiritual development) is called by the same name. For example, if Mithyatva arises, then the Gunasthan is called Mithyatva Sanvara. Similarly, in Desh Viriti (non-attachment to place), etc., and in the Gunasthan of Prasanta (tranquility) and Kshina Moha (diminished attachment), etc., there is Kshaya Sanvara. In this way, the Bhavyajiva (soul destined for liberation) should contemplate Sanvara Bhavana, which is the form of Sanvara due to the stoppage of Asrava.

**Aviriti Sanvara is considered to be Pramada Sanvara in the context of Apramatta Samyata (non-negligent restraint), etc.**

**In the A Yogik Kevali Gunasthan (stage of the liberated soul), there is Sanvara of all Yoga.**

**The detailed explanation is given. Therefore, Sanvara Bhavana is the crown jewel in the community of Bhavanas (contemplations).**

**Now, Nirjara Bhavana is explained.**

**Verse 86:**

> **Meaning:** The shedding or separation of Karmas, which are the seeds of worldly existence, from the soul's domain is called Nirjara. It is of two types: Sakama Nirjara and Akarama Nirjara.

**Explanation:**

> In the scriptures, the shedding or separation of Karmas, which are the cause of worldly existence in the form of wandering in the four states of existence, from the soul's domain, with the experience of their essence, is called Nirjara. This Nirjara is of two types: 'May my Karmas be shed' - this is Sakama Nirjara, which is done with desire or with a pure purpose, such as performing austerities. To desire the fruits of this world or the next world is not Nirjara, because it is forbidden for the seeker. It is said, "One should not perform austerities for the sake of worldly happiness, nor for the sake of attaining desired happiness in the next world. One should not perform austerities for the sake of fame, praise, and applause. One should not perform austerities for any purpose other than the benefit of Nirjara (purification of the soul)." (Dasha Va. 9/4) This is the nature of Sakama Nirjara. In contrast, Akarama Nirjara is devoid of the aforementioned desires. It is devoid of the desire, 'May my sinful Karmas be destroyed.'

## The Nature of Nirjara

**Chapter 4, Light 4 of Yoga Shastra, Verses 87-89**

**Explanation of both types of Nirjara**

**Meaning:**

|| 413 || The Nirjara of those who are restrained (Samyami) should be understood as Sakama (desire-driven), and the Nirjara of all other beings, from those with one sense to those with five senses, is Akam (desireless). Just as fruit ripens in two ways, one through means and the other naturally on the tree, so too, Nirjara is of two types: Sakama Nirjara, where karmas are quickly destroyed through means like tapasya (austerity), and Akam Nirjara, where karmas ripen naturally in due time and are experienced involuntarily. || 87 ||

**Explanation:**

Those restrained individuals who practice tapasya to destroy their karmas, with the intention of "Let my karmas be destroyed," do not desire worldly or otherworldly pleasures from that tapasya. This is Sakama Nirjara. The Nirjara of beings other than the restrained, which is independent of the fruit of karma destruction, is Akam Nirjara. It occurs in this way:

Beings with one sense, from earth-bodied to plant-bodied, experience unbearable karmas (Asatavedaniya) due to cold, heat, rain, water, fire, wounds from weapons, cutting, piercing, etc. This causes the subtle karmas to detach from their own region (Atma Pradesh). Beings with impaired senses experience unbearable karmas in the form of hunger, thirst, cold, heat, etc., while five-sensed animals experience them in the form of cutting, piercing, fire, weapons, etc. In hell, there are three types of terrible pain: hunger, thirst, disease, poverty, etc., which are experienced as unbearable karmas. The same is true for unrestrained humans. This means that unrestrained beings involuntarily experience the pain that has come upon them, and are forced to endure it. This detachment of karmas from their own region is Akam Nirjara.

**Doubt:**

There seems to be no distinct nature of both Sakama and Akam Nirjara.

**Resolution:**

To resolve this, an example is given: The experience of the fruit of unbearable karmas occurs in two ways: naturally and through means. Just as the fruits of a tree fall naturally when ripe, and others are ripened through means, like mangoes being ripened by covering them with grass in a vacuum, or ripening naturally on the tree in due time, similarly, the destruction of karmas also occurs in two ways: one through means like tapasya, which leads to quick destruction (Sakama Nirjara), and the other through the natural ripening of karmas, where they are experienced involuntarily without any means (Akam Nirjara). This is why there are two types of Nirjara.

**Further Doubt:**

The example of fruit ripening has no connection to the destruction of karmas.

**Resolution:**

There is a connection. Just as fruit ripens in two ways, so too, the destruction of karmas occurs in two ways. Here, ripening is the form of Nirjara. In Nirjara, the fruit of karma ripens. || 87 ||

**Now, the cause of Sakama Nirjara is explained clearly through an example:**

|| 414 || Just as gold, even with impurities, becomes pure when heated in a blazing fire, so too, a being filled with the impurities of evil karmas becomes pure when heated in the fire of tapasya. || 88 ||

**Meaning:**

**Explanation:**

Tapasya is that which heats the rasa (essence), other bodily elements, and karmas. It is said that tapasya is that which burns the rasa, blood, flesh, fat, bones, marrow, semen, and other elements, as well as evil karmas, to ashes. This is the cause of Nirjara. It is said that "If, even while being nourished, impurities are diligently eliminated, then the impurities are destroyed. Similarly, the soul burns the accumulated karmas through tapasya." || 88 ||

**Tapasya is of two types: external and internal. First, the types of external tapasya are explained:**

|| 415 || Fasting (Anashan), Unoonadri (eating less), reducing one's activities (Vritti Sanksepan), giving up desires (Rasa Tyag), bodily hardship (Tanuklesh), and merging (Linata) - these are the six types of external tapasya. || 89 ||

**Meaning:**

## The Nature of Nirjara Bhavana Tapa

**Fourth Prakash of Yoga Shastra, Verse 89 Commentary:**

1. **Anashan (Fasting):** There are two types of fasting: one for a limited time and the other for life. 

* **Limited Time Anashan:** This type of fasting ranges from a simple Namaskara (prayer) to a six-month continuous fast, as per the teachings of Bhagwan Mahavir. In the time of Shri Rishabhdev, it could be for a year, and for the 22 Tirthankaras in between, it could be for eight months. 
* **Lifelong Anashan:** This has three types: Padpogamana, Ingini, and Bhaktapratyakhyan. 
    * **Padpogamana:** This has two sub-types: with and without suffering. When a sadhak (practitioner) is suffering from a disease at the end of their life, they can choose to fast and die, which is considered Padpogamana with suffering. The other type, without suffering, is when a sadhak, having taught their disciple about the principles of acceptance and service, having followed the Gachch (spiritual lineage) diligently, and having practiced Ugravihar (intense spiritual practice), feels ready for Samadhi-maran (death in meditation) due to their advanced age. They then choose a place free from living beings and remain still like a tree, their mind focused on meditation until their life force departs. 
    * **Ingini:** This is a specific type of fasting, as described in the scriptures, involving specific actions. The sadhak, knowing their remaining lifespan, chooses a secluded place and renounces all four types of food. They move from shade to sunlight and sunlight to shade, remaining mindful and focused on meditation until they attain Samadhi.
    * **Bhaktapratyakhyan:** In this type, the sadhak remains within the Gachch-Sampradaya (spiritual community), lays down a soft Santhara (bed), renounces attachment to their body and possessions, and rejects all four types of food. They may receive Namaskara mantra (prayer) from other sadhus or offer service. They may change positions as needed and accept death in Samadhi.

2. **Unodari:** This is a type of tapa where one consumes less than what is required for the stomach, meaning the stomach is kept "un-full". The action or feeling associated with this is "Aunaadarya" (lack of desire for food). There are four types:
    * **Alpahar-Unodari:** Consuming only eight kaur (mouthfuls) of food.
    * **Aparadh-Unodari:** Consuming around twelve kaur.
    * **Ardh-Unodari:** Consuming sixteen kaur.
    * **Prapt-Aahar-Se-Kuch-Kam-Unodari:** Consuming slightly less than the usual amount of food, which is considered to be thirty-two kaur for men. 
    * **Note:** The kaur should be of medium size, excluding the very large and very small ones. One should consume food according to the size of their mouth, avoiding any distortion. 
    * **Variations:** Each of these types can have further variations by reducing the kaur by one each time.
    * **Women:** The usual amount of food for women is considered to be twenty-eight kaur. The same principles of Unodari apply to women, with the appropriate adjustments.

3. **Vrittisankshep:** This refers to reducing one's livelihood to a minimum. It involves limiting one's possessions to a specific amount, such as one, two, or three houses, or limiting one's activities to a specific area, such as a neighborhood, village, or half a village. This limitation can also be applied to material possessions, territory, time, and emotions.

4. **Rasparityaag:** This refers to renouncing substances that nourish the body and tissues. These substances are considered "Viggai" or "Vikritik" in the scriptures, as they can lead to imbalances. This includes alcohol, meat, honey, butter, ghee, milk, yogurt, oil, jaggery, sweets, and other delicacies.

5. **Kayaklesh:** This refers to enduring physical hardship for the sake of Dharma (righteousness), as described in the Agamas (ancient scriptures). Some may question how the body, being inanimate, can experience hardship. The answer is that the body and the soul are inseparable, like milk and water. Therefore, the soul's suffering can be considered as the body's suffering. 

**Note:** These four types of tapa are considered "Mahaviggai" (major austerities) and should be completely renounced.

According to tradition, **Kayaklesha** (physical austerity) is achieved through specific postures, etc. It also includes refraining from adornment, embellishment, and care of the body, as well as activities like hair removal.

**Doubt:** What is the difference between **Parishha** (endurance) and **Kayaklesha**?

**Solution:** **Kayaklesha** is the voluntary endurance of hardship, while **Parishha** is the involuntary experience of suffering or pain inflicted by others. Thus, there is a difference between the two.

**Sanleena (Immersion) Austerity:**  Residing in a secluded, peaceful, and solitary place like a deserted house, temple, assembly hall, mountain cave, etc., free from women, men, and eunuchs; contracting one's senses and limbs; guarding oneself from objects of sense; and restraining the mind, speech, body, senses, and passions - this is **Sanleena** austerity. || 89 ||

These six types are **external austerities**. They require external resources, are visible to others, and are suitable for both non-Jain and householders. Hence, they are called **external austerities**. These six types of external austerities lead to detachment, lightness of the body, control of the senses, preservation of restraint, and the destruction of karmas.

Now, we will discuss the types of **internal austerities**. || 416 ||

**Praayashchitta (Penitence), Vaayaavrutya (Reversion), Swaadhyaaya (Self-Study), Vinaya (Humility), Vyutsarga (Renunciation), and Shubha Dhyaan (Auspicious Meditation) - these are the six types of internal austerities.** || 90 ||

**Explanation:**

1. **Praayashchitta (Penitence):** Even a slight transgression in the primary and secondary virtues pollutes them. To purify them, **Praayashchitta** is performed. It is a special practice of contemplation and remembrance for the purification of those who have deviated from the path of righteous conduct. It is also called **Praayashchitta** when the transgression (in vows) occurs mainly in the mind (consciousness), but not in speech or body. Or, **Praayashchitta** is that which purifies sins and the mind. The word **chiti** is used in the sense of knowledge and purification. (Tattvarth Bhashya 8-22)

**Praayashchitta** is of ten types: 1. **Aalochana** (Confession), 2. **Pratikramna** (Reversion), 3. **Tadubhaya** (Mixed), 4. **Viveka** (Discernment), 5. **Vyutsarga** (Renunciation), 6. **Tap** (Austerity), 7. **Chheda** (Separation), 8. **Mool** (Root), 9. **Anvastaapy** (Irreversible), and 10. **Paaraanchik** (Transitory).

1. **Aalochana (Confession):** **Aalochana** means revealing one's transgressions to the Guru. The transgressions should be revealed in the same order as they were committed. The transgression that carries the most severe penance should be confessed first, followed by the others in descending order. Revealing the faults to the Guru in the same order as they were committed is **Aalochana**. **Praayashchitta** is **anuloomya** (sequential). The **Geetarth** (a commentary) states for the disciple: "Knowing the five, ten, and fifteen, according to the Guru, the minor, and the transgression, if the transgression is major, it should be revealed first, followed by the smaller ones, and then the smallest, in this order."

2. **Pratikramna (Reversion):** Returning to one's true nature after abandoning the transgression is **Pratikramna**. It involves sincere repentance for the sin with a commitment to not repeat it.

3. **Tadubhaya (Mixed):** This involves both **Aalochana** and **Pratikramna**. First, confess to the Guru, and then perform **Pratikramna** as instructed by the Guru.

4. **Viveka (Discernment):** This involves the renunciation of food, water, tools, bedding, etc., that are associated with the mind or soul.

5. **Vyutsarga (Renunciation):** **Kayotsarga** (Renunciation of the Body): This involves renouncing non-essential, faulty, etc., substances; going and coming; sinful (bad) dreams; traveling by boat to the opposite shore; going and coming for bodily functions; cleansing oneself of excrement and urine; and renouncing the activities of the mind, speech, and body with a specific intention. This is **Praayashchitta** in the form of **Kayotsarga** to eliminate those faults.

6. **Tap (Austerity):** According to the **Chheda Granth** (a text) or the **Jita Kalpa Sutra** (a text), if an austerity leads to purification, then it should be performed and practiced.

## Explanation of Internal Penance

**Yoga Shastra, Fourth Light, Verse 90**

7. **Chhed:** If a disciple, who is not under control by penance, is not able to control his passions, then cutting off his initiation for 5 days and nights is called Chhed Prayashchitta.

8. **Mool:** Returning to the original vows.

9. **Anvasthapy:** If a very wicked Sadhu does not perform any special penance, then he should be given vows again, and made to perform such penance that he becomes unable to even stand or sit. After making him perform such penance, when he requests another Sadhu, "Aarya! I want to stand up," then that Sadhu should silently perform his task without speaking to the penitent Sadhu. It is also said, "Make me stand up, sit down, bring alms, do the writing of the bowl." Thus, the other Sadhu, like a brother of the penitent, should silently perform his task (without speaking). (Vyavahar Bhashya 1/368) After performing such penance, he should be given the great initiation.

10. **Paranchik:** If penance does not work, or if there is no penance greater than the last penance, or if the offense has reached its final stage, then that penance is called Paranchik. Such a person who commits a great offense should be expelled from the dress, family, group, or community. The ancient teachers have said that among these 10 penances, penances up to Chhed are like the treatment of a wound. In this, very small surgical instruments, small thorns can be taken out, which have not reached the blood in the body, only attached to the skin; similarly, many small offenses (like thorns) can be quickly removed (erased) by penance. If there is a hole there, then there is no need to massage it, because the surgical instrument is small, so the hole is also small. The second surgical instrument is such that (thorn) when taken out, the hole needs to be massaged, but there is no need to fill the hole with earwax. The third type of surgical instrument is more deep, then after taking it out, the surgical site is massaged and earwax is filled in it. The fourth type of surgical instrument is such that it is pulled out, massaged, and blood is also squeezed out to relieve pain. The fifth type of surgical instrument is such that it has gone very deep, to remove it, the action of coming and going, walking etc. is stopped; the sixth surgical instrument is such that after pulling it out, only beneficial, moderate, and digestible food is eaten, or one has to remain without food. The seventh type of surgical instrument is such that after pulling it out,
1. Flesh etc. have been corrupted: There, its incision is made - it is given. If a snake, a mole, etc. poisonous animal has bitten, or if there is a disease like ringworm, scabies, etc., and even after the previously mentioned remedy, the pain does not subside, but is increasing further, then for the protection of the remaining limbs, the limb along with the bone is cut off. Thus, from the example of Dravyavrana (external wound), the wound or hole in the form of offense in the body of character, which is in the form of Moolguna-Uttarguna, should be treated with the penance method from purification, criticism to Chhed. Pujya Acharya Shri Bhadrabahu Swami has said - the first surgical instrument is such that it is not so sharp, it has not reached the blood, it is only attached to the skin, then it is pulled out, the wound is not so deep that it needs to be massaged. The second surgical instrument is pulled out and massaged; if the thorn (surgical instrument) has gone deeper, then such a surgical instrument is taken out and that place is massaged and earwax is filled in the hole. After pulling out the fourth type of surgical instrument, so that there is no pain, that place is pressed and blood is taken out. The fifth type of surgical instrument is such that it goes very deep, then if it has to be removed, the action of movement is stopped. After removing the sixth surgical instrument, to heal the wound, beneficial, moderate, and digestible food is eaten or food is stopped. The seventh type of surgical instrument is such that after it is applied, as much part of the limb rots or deteriorates, the flesh there is cut off. But even then, if the pain or disease does not stop increasing, or if a snake, etc. poisonous animal has bitten, or if there is a disease of itching or decay, then for the protection of the remaining limb, that limb along with the bone has to be cut off. In the body, like these eight types of surgical instruments, the supreme character man in the form of Moolguna-Uttarguna

## Explanation of Internal Austerity

**Chapter Four, Light of Yoga, Verse 90**

To protect the body, one should treat the wound of emotions caused by the surgical instrument of transgression. The first type of wound, caused by transgression in activities like begging for alms, is purified simply by revealing and criticizing it to the Guru. The second type of wound, caused by transgression due to sudden circumstances or lack of secrecy, is purified by repentance. The third type of wound, caused by attachment and aversion towards objects like words, is purified by both criticism and repentance. The fourth type of wound, caused by knowingly consuming non-permissible food, is purified by reflection (parathna). The fifth type of wound is purified by bodily exertion, the sixth by austerity, and the seventh by a specific type of piercing. (Necessary Notes 1434-1442)

The fruits of repentance are: abandoning the fault of carelessness, removing the state of surgical instrument through joy in emotions, not abandoning the limits, and firmly practicing self-control.

**2. Vyayavritti**

Vyayavritti is the inclination or feeling towards performing actions mentioned in the teachings of the Nirgranthas or the Agamas.

## The Cause of Karma Reduction (Nirjara)

**Chapter 4, Light 4, Verse 91 of the Yoga Shastra**

**Tapping and Repeating:**  Repetition and reflection with pronunciation is called **Paravartan**. 
**Religious Discourse:** Giving religious discourses, explaining, and describing in detail according to the **Anuyog** is called **Dharmakatha**.

**4. Vinaya:**  **Vinaya** is that which removes the eight types of karma. It has four divisions: **Jnana Vinaya**, **Darshan Vinaya**, **Charitra Vinaya**, and **Upchar Vinaya**.

* **Jnana Vinaya:**  Receiving knowledge with utmost respect.
* **Darshan Vinaya:**  Being unshakeable and full of faith, believing that the teachings of the **Tirthankara** from **Samayik** to **Lokabindu Saar** are true.
* **Charitra Vinaya:**  Having good feelings towards **Charitra** and **Charitravan**, going to greet them, joining hands, etc.
* **Upchar Vinaya:**  Offering mental, verbal, and physical salutations to them even indirectly, praising their qualities, remembering them, etc.

**5. Vyutsarga:**  **Vyutsarga** is the abandonment of things that should be abandoned. It also has two divisions: **Bahya** and **Abhyantara**.

* **Bahya Vyutsarga:**  Abandoning more than twelve types of **Upadhi** or abandoning food, water, etc., that are **Ashaishniya** or contain living beings.
* **Abhyantara Vyutsarga:**  Abandoning **Kashaya** within or abandoning the body at the time of death or abandoning attachment to the body when faced with adversity.

**Question:**  Why is **Vyutsarga** mentioned again here in the divisions of **Tap** when it was already mentioned in the divisions of **Prayashchitta**?

**Answer:**  There, it was mentioned for the purification of repeated transgressions. Here, **Vyutsarga Tap** is mentioned for general **Nirjara**, so there is no repetition error.

**6. Shubh Dhyan:**  Abandoning **Aarta** and **Roudra Dhyan** and practicing **Dharma** and **Shukla** - these two are **Shubh Dhyan**. The explanation of **Aarta-Roudra Dhyan** has been given earlier. The explanation of **Dharma Dhyan** and **Shukla Dhyan** will be given later [on page 444].

In this way, there are six types of **Abhyantara Tap**. This **Tap** is called **Abhyantara** because it burns and destroys internal karma or because it can only be known by the **Kevali Bhagwan** due to the inward focus of the soul.

**Dhyan** is placed at the highest position among the twelve **Tapas** because it is the most important in the practice of **Moksha**. It is also said:

> Although **Samvara** and **Nirjara** are the paths to **Moksha**, **Tap** is superior among them, and among **Tapas**, **Dhyan** should be considered the main part of **Moksha**. (Dhyan Shatak, Verse 96)

Now, **Tap** is explicitly stated as the cause of **Nirjara**.

**Verse 91:**

> When the fire of **Tap** burns brightly, both externally and internally, then the restrained person quickly burns to ashes the difficult-to-reduce karma like **Jnana Avaraniya** (or the forest of bad deeds).

**Explanation:**

The main reason for burning karma through **Tapasya** with restraint is that **Nirjara** occurs through **Tap**. But **Tap** is the cause of **Nirjara**, this is said by implication, but it is also the cause of **Samvara**. **Umaswati**, the main commentator, said:

> **Tap** leads to both **Samvara** and **Nirjara**. Because **Tap** is the cause of **Samvara**, it stops the influx of new karma. And it also reduces old karma and leads to the attainment of **Nirvana**.

The meaning of the **Antar Shlokas** used in this context is presented here:

> Just as the doors of a lake are closed with effort from all sides, so that new water flow is stopped from entering the lake, similarly, by stopping the **Ashravas**, the soul enveloped in **Samvara** does not get filled with new karma. Just as the water collected in a lake dries up due to the intense heat of the sun, similarly, all the accumulated karma bound to the soul is dried up by **Tap** and becomes reduced in an instant. **Abhyantara Tap** is a stronger cause of **Nirjara** than **Bahya Tap**. Among them, **Dhyan Tap** reigns supreme in the lives of **Munis**. **Dhyan Yogis** quickly reduce even very strong karma accumulated over a long time. Just as indigestion and other disorders (doshas) arising in the body dry up due to fasting, similarly, the karma accumulated in the soul dries up due to **Tap**. Just as a cloud mass is shattered or dissolved by a strong wind, similarly, **Tapasya** also...

## The Nature of Dharma-Svakhyata-Bhavana and the 10 Divisions of Samyak Dharma

**From Yoga Shastra, Fourth Light, Verses 92-93**

The group of karmas are shattered. If the work of destroying karmas from both sides by both Samvara and Nirjara continues, then the soul, attaining the state of perfection, obtains liberation from the stability (Dhruvata) of these two. By performing both types of austerities, the soul with pure intellect attains liberation, which is the destruction of all karmas, one day. Thus, one should contemplate the Nirjara Bhavana, which strengthens the austerity, destroys all karmas, is like a bridge to cross the ocean of the world, and is the cause of the destruction of attachment. ||91||

Now, regarding Dharma-Svakhyata-Bhavana, it is said: 418. This Dharma is truly Svakhyata, declared by the supreme Jinas. The being who takes refuge in it does not drown in the ocean of existence. ||92||

**Meaning:** The supreme Jinas have well-explained this Dharma. The being who takes refuge in it does not drown in the ocean of existence. ||12||

**Meaning:** Here, the special meaning of Dharma is Su+A+Khyata, Svakhyata, which means: Dharma that is superior to the Kutirthika Dharma, prohibits wrong conduct, is defined by boundaries, and is declared by the Vitaraga-Sarvagnas. ||12||

Now, the ten divisions of this Samyak Dharma are stated: 419. Samyama, Sunruta, Saucha, Brahma, Akinchanata, Tapa, Shanti, Divam, Mrjruta, and Mukti are the ten divisions of it. ||93||

**Meaning:** It is of ten types: 1. Samyama, 2. Satya, 3. Saucha, 4. Brahmacharya, 5. Akinchanata, 6. Tapa, 7. Kshama, 8. Mrduta, 9. Saralata, and 10. Nirlobhata. ||13|| [This is also called Shraman Dharma].

**Explanation:**

1. **Samyama:** Means compassion for living beings. It is of 17 types. Samyama on earth-bodied, water-bodied, fire-bodied, air-bodied, and plant-bodied beings; Samyama in the form of abandoning the initiation, continuation, and commencement of actions done, caused, and approved by the mind, speech, and body of beings with two, three, four, and five senses - this is of nine types. Samyama in the form of non-living things like books, etc., is the tenth division. Keeping books, etc., with careful copying and cleaning, due to the influence of the Dosha of the unfavorable time, due to the lack of intellectual strength, and for the benefit of the disciples, is Ajiva Samyama. Similarly, there is Preksha Samyama, which is to see with the eyes a piece of land free from seeds, animals, and green plants, and to see while sleeping, sitting, etc. Not inspiring a householder who is engaged in harmful activities; ignoring harmful actions is Upeksha Samyama. Seeing with the eyes, cleaning the ground with dust removal, etc., for sleeping and sitting, and while walking from one place to another, if there is dust from the earth on the feet, whether consciously, unconsciously, or mixed, then cleaning it is Pramardhana Samyama. If food and water are defective, unsuitable, or clothes, utensils, etc., are in contact with living beings, then carefully placing such food, water, clothes, etc., in a defect-free, inanimate place is Paristhapana Samyama. To be free from the mind that is filled with harm, pride, jealousy, etc., and to engage it in Dharma-Dhyana, etc., is Mana Samyama. To refrain from harsh, cruel, bitter, etc., cautious words, and to engage in speech with good language is Vachana Samyama. To abandon cautious activities like running, fleeing, jumping, aimless wandering, etc., and to engage in good actions is Kaya Samyama. In this way, Samyama in the form of refraining from violence is of 17 types: Earth, water, fire, air, plants, beings with two, three, four, and five senses, non-living things, Preksha, Upeksha, Pramardhana, Pratilekhana, Paristhapana, mind, speech, and body Samyama. (Aavashyak Sutra)

2. **Sunruta:** Means speaking truthful and pleasant words. Avoiding harshness, gossip, rudeness, fickleness, or speaking with a suppressed tongue, hesitantly, stammering, quickly, doubtfully, vulgarly, with attachment and aversion, with deceit and sin, with slander, etc., and speaking with sweetness, generosity, clarity, revealing excellent things, according to the words of Shri Arihant Prabhu, meaningful, prevalent in social conduct, understanding the meaning, according to the time and place, with restraint, with limited words, beneficial, full of virtues, while speaking and asking questions, answering when asked, speaking without falsehood is Sunruta (Satya).

## Ten Aspects of Right Conduct (Samyak Dharma)

**3. Purity (Shouch)**: Purity is not allowing the stain of sinful actions to touch one's restraint. For a lay person, the main form of purity is **Artha Shouch**, which means giving up taking what is not given and giving up the desire to take another's wealth due to greed. Even worldly scriptures say that **Artha Shouch** is the greatest of all purities. One who is pure in matters of wealth is pure. Purity achieved through dirt or water is not true purity. (Manusmriti 5.106) Such an impure being accumulates karmas in the form of **Bhavamala** in this world and the next. Even if he is advised, he does not heed the advice for his own good. Therefore, one should understand **Shouch Dharma** as giving up taking what is not given.

**4. Celibacy (Brahmacharya)**: Celibacy is restraint of the senses, both in the presence of the object of desire and in the absence of it, with nine types of celibacy. Just as 'Bhima' is called 'Bheem' in short, similarly 'Brahmacharya' is called 'Brahm' here. Since celibacy is great, even staying in a Guru's house for self-realization is celibacy. Celibacy is also the form of renunciation of the non-Brahman.

**5. Non-Possession (Akinchanya)**: One who has no possessions is **Akinchan**, and his state of mind is **Akinchanya**. A Muni who practices **Akinchanya Dharma** is detached from his body, religious paraphernalia, and worldly possessions. They are non-possessive and take food, water, etc., only for the sustenance of their journey of restraint. Just as oil is applied to the axle of a cart to keep it moving smoothly, they take food and water without attachment to keep the body, which is like a cart, moving smoothly. They wear clothes and other equipment for restraint and protection of the body, but not out of greed or attachment. This is the secret of **Akinchanya** in the form of renunciation of possessions.

**6. Austerity (Tap)**: Austerity is the cause of **Sanvar** and **Nirjara**, which have been described earlier. It is of twelve types as mentioned before, but also exists in many other forms. These include **Yavamdhya**, **Vajramdhya**, **Chandrayan**, **Kankaavali**, **Ratnaavali**, **Sarvato Bhadra**, **Bhadrouttar**, **Vardhaman Ayambilatap**, etc. The twelve types of **Bhikshu Pratimas** are also austerity, which include seven **Pratimas** from one month to seven months, followed by three **Pratimas** of seven nights each, then one **Pratima** of three days and nights, and finally one **Pratima** of one day and night.

**7. Patience (Kshaanti)**: Patience is the ability to bear both the bearable and the unbearable. Patience arises from contemplating the good and bad thoughts in the mind when faced with anger, from contemplating the faults arising from anger, from contemplating the nature of a child, from contemplating the consequences of one's actions, and from contemplating the benefits of possessing patience. If others are angry with me because of my faults, they are actually pointing out the existence of my faults (good intentions). If I do not have those faults, then they are speaking falsely, so I should forgive them. It is said that if someone is angry, a wise person should contemplate the truth: if their anger is true, what is the benefit of getting angry, and if it is false, what is the benefit of getting angry at an ignorant person? Thus, one should practice patience by contemplating the faults of anger. An angry person is surely bound by sinful actions; it awakens the desire to kill another, thus destroying non-violence. In a fit of anger, a seeker destroys his own vows of truthfulness. He forgets the principles of initiation and steals what is not given. In hatred, he breaks the fourth vow by engaging in non-celibacy (mentally) with a deceitful woman. A very angry yogi becomes attached to worldly people and seeks their help, thus destroying the fifth vow. What to speak of the destruction of the other virtues, they are also destroyed. An angry soul insults the Guru and becomes attached to desires. Thus, one should practice patience even towards those who are foolish (naive). One should contemplate their nature: a child (ignorant) being sometimes indirectly and sometimes directly angry, sometimes beating and punishing in anger, sometimes trying to corrupt dharma. At that time, one should think that it is my good fortune that this is happening to me.

## The Ten Aspects of Right Conduct (Samyak Dharma)

**Chapter Four, Light of Yoga, Verse 93**

The text *Yoga Shastra* (Chapter Four, Light of Yoga, Verse 93) criticizes anger in indirect ways, but doesn't speak about it directly. This is good. If someone is angry directly, one should say, "This person is so good that they only express their anger through words and don't physically harm me." If they hit, one should say, "This good person only hits and doesn't take my life." If someone is about to kill, one should say, "They are only taking my life, they are not corrupting me from my Dharma." In this way, one should find benefit in the absence of harm and consider the nature of a child. When the karmas one has committed come to fruition, such contemplation leads to forgiveness. This is how the fruits of past karmas manifest. The karmas cannot be destroyed without experiencing their fruits or performing austerities. In the inevitable experience of karmic fruits, others are merely instruments. It is said, "All beings experience the fruits of their past karmas, others are merely instruments in committing offenses or doing good deeds." One should contemplate this way during the time of experiencing the fruits of one's own karmas. Contemplating the qualities of forgiveness brings forth the virtue of forgiveness. By cultivating forgiveness, even when provoked, anger does not arise. There is a firm resolve for good thoughts, supreme samadhi arises, there is permanent joy within, one does not try to find weapons to kill, there is no outburst, the face radiates joy, the eyes do not turn red with anger, but the face remains bright, there is no sweating, no trembling, and no desire to harm others. These and other such qualities are obtained by cultivating forgiveness. Forgiveness is the opposite of anger.

**8. Gentleness (Mardava)**

Gentleness means softness, tenderness, humility, and freedom from pride. Gentleness arises from the suppression of ego. Ego manifests in eight forms, such as pride in one's caste, etc., which we have discussed earlier. Therefore, a man blinded by pride in his caste, lineage, strength, beauty, wealth, austerity, beloved, (or wealth) and intelligence (or knowledge) is incapable of seeing what is beneficial for him in this world and the next. (Prashmarati 80) Gentleness is the opposite of pride, which is the root cause of these vices.

**9. Simplicity (Saralata)**

Simplicity means righteousness, unity of mind, speech, and body, or straightforwardness. Simplicity is the absence of crookedness, cunning, and deceitful behavior. A deceitful person does not act according to their words. Therefore, they are a source of doubt for everyone. They are untrustworthy. It is said, "Even though a deceitful person does not commit any offense, due to the fault of their deceitful nature, they are untrustworthy like a serpent to everyone." (Prashmarati 28) Thus, simplicity is the opposite of deceit.

**10. Liberation (Mukti)**

Liberation means freedom from greed, i.e., the severance of both external and internal desires. It is the absence of greed and hope for expectations. A greedy person is strengthened by the group of vices: anger, pride, deceit, violence, falsehood, theft, non-brahma, and attachment. It is said, "Greed is the refuge of destruction and the only highway to all suffering." A greedy person trapped in the clutches of greed experiences new sorrows every moment. (Prashmarati 29) Therefore, liberation is the form of renunciation of greed. It is characterized by selflessness, self-motivation, absence of possessiveness, detachment, not harming others, remaining unaffected by the instruments of restraint like control of the senses, etc.

**Conclusion**

Thus, there are ten aspects of Dharma. There is a doubt here: Truth, restraint, purity, Brahma, non-possession, etc., are included in the great vows, and forgiveness, gentleness, simplicity, and liberation are included in the section on *Sanvara*. Austerity is said to be the cause of *Sanvara* and *Nirjara*. Then, what is the purpose of mentioning these ten Dharmas again in the context of explaining Dharma? This would be a repetition! We resolve this by saying that although there was no need to mention restraint, etc., again here, the ten types of Dharma are explained in a different way because this is the Dharma declared by the Arihant Bhagwan. Therefore, it was necessary to mention it. This is true because it explains the qualities of Dharma and praises the Bhagwan for the sake of comparison. || 93 || Now, we will discuss the effects of Dharma.

## Dharma 'Phal' and Dharma 'Vichar'

**Yoga Shastra, Fourth Prakash, Verses 94 to 102**

**Verse 94:**

* **Translation:** Due to the influence of Dharma, even in the *Sushama Kala* (a time of prosperity), when they are in the form of plants and stones, *Kalpavriksha* (wish-fulfilling tree), *Chintamani Ratna* (a precious gem), etc., give desired results to *Dharma Atma* (souls who are righteous). Even in the *Dushsama Kala* (a time of adversity), they are not even visible, yet they provide desired results (in the form of wealth).

**Verse 95:**

* **Translation:** Dharma saves a human being who is falling into the vast ocean of misery. It is the only friend who is always close by; it is extremely affectionate.

**Verse 96:**

* **Translation:** The ocean does not drown the earth, and the clouds benefit the earth. This is undoubtedly the effect of Dharma alone.

**Verse 97:**

* **Translation:** If the flames of fire were to go sideways, the world would be burnt, and if the wind were to move upwards, it would be difficult for living beings to survive. But this does not happen. The reason for this is the inconceivable influence of Dharma.

**Verse 98:**

* **Translation:** Without any support, without any base, the earth, which is the base of the entire universe, stands firm. There is no other reason for this except Dharma.

**Verse 99:**

* **Translation:** The sun and the moon rise in this world every day for the benefit of the world. This is undoubtedly the effect of the rule of Dharma.

**Verse 100:**

* **Translation:** Dharma is the friend of the friendless, the companion of the companionless, and the protector of the orphan. Dharma is the only one who is affectionate towards the entire world.

**Verse 101:**

* **Translation:** Those who have taken refuge in Dharma cannot be harmed by demons, yakshas, snakes, tigers, lions, fire, or poison.

**Verse 102:**

* **Translation:** Dharma saves a human being from falling into hell and the abyss. Dharma bestows unparalleled wealth, even the wealth of omniscience.

The term "Dharmasvākhyātabhāvanā" used in this context is not found in other religious texts.

**Yogaśāstra, Fourth Light, Verse 102:** Dharma protects beings from falling into the hellish abyss. Dharma also enables one to attain the glory of the unparalleled omniscient.

**Explanation:** The remaining fruits of Dharma should be understood as incidental. In this regard, the meaning of the inner verses is presented: The ten types of Yati Dharma mentioned earlier were not seen (accepted) by the wrong view. And if anyone has ever said it, they did not say it by practicing it. The meaning of any truth is through the speech of each person. It is also in someone's mind, but if they implement it in practice, understand that they are a devotee of Jina Dharma. Those who are enslaved by the intellect in the Vedic scriptures and those who memorize their sutras do not know Dharma even in the slightest. How can there be Dharma in a Yajnika who performs various animal-killing sacrifices like Go-medha, Ashvamedha, etc., and who kills or causes animals to be killed? How can this be the Dharma of the Puranas and their creators, the Puranic, who speak of things that are unworthy of faith, false, and contradictory to each other? How can there be Dharma in the life of the Smarta, etc., who take away the property of others through wrong systems and who call only earth and water as cleanliness? How can this be called the poverty of a Brahmin who wants to take everything from a Yajamana who does not want to give, and who takes life for money? Where is the austerity of the Buddhists who clean their mouths day and night, but are devoid of the discrimination between edible and inedible? "Sleeping on a soft bed, drinking sweet juice in the morning, eating lunch, drinking cold water in the evening, and eating raisins and sugar at midnight. Thus, the Shakyas (Buddhists) have described a beautiful Dharma in eating and drinking as they please." There is not even a trace of the Dharma of forgiveness in the worldly Rishis who curse in a moment for a small offense. "Our Brahmin caste is the best; how can there be the Dharma of gentleness in Brahmins who are intoxicated with this kind of caste pride, who are ill-behaved, and who have this kind of mind, living in the four Ashramas? How can there be even a trace of simplicity in hypocrites who have the results of pride in their hearts and who outwardly wear the garb of renunciation? How can there be the Dharma of liberation (non-attachment) in the Kula-griha-Brahmin who is always entangled in family, wife, house, children, etc., and in attachment?

Thus, one should contemplate this Dharma-svākhyātabhāvanā of the omniscient Arihant Bhagwan, who is free from attachment, aversion, or delusion. False words come out due to attachment, aversion, or delusion-ignorance. Since these defects are absent in the non-attached, how can the Arihant be a false speaker? It is not possible for those who have a mind contaminated by attachment, aversion, etc., to speak the truth. They perform sacrifices, perform homa, etc., and by performing many acts of fulfilling desires, such as building wells, ponds, lakes, etc., they cause the death of animals and tell them about the pleasures of heaven. They want to satisfy their ancestors by feeding Brahmins, they perform rituals like ghee yoni, etc., and make them perform atonement for their sins. They justify the remarriage of women due to the five calamities. They say that a woman who does not have a son should have a Kshetraja offspring (born through Niyoga with another man). They say that impure women are purified by their menstruation. They earn a living by killing goats, etc., in sacrifices with a benevolent mind. They make people drink alcohol for seven generations in the Sautrāmaṇi sacrifice. They believe that touching a cow that eats dung is purifying. They say that bathing in water, etc., purifies sins. They worship trees like banyan, peepal, amla, etc. They believe that the offering of ghee, etc., in fire pleases the gods and goddesses. They believe that milking a cow on earth pacifies misfortune. They preach the same kind of vows and Dharma for women, as if they are inferior. They wear matted hair, pierce their ears, apply ashes on their bodies, wear loincloths, worship gods with ak, dhatura, bilva leaves, tulsi, etc. They deceive the Muni Devas and people by playing on their buttocks, dancing, singing, etc., repeatedly, making a sound like a musical instrument from their mouths, and speaking falsely. They repeatedly take and abandon the Pashupata vow, desiring slavery and servitude by breaking their vows. They kill lice in the use of medicines, etc., and they use the bones of humans.

## A Detailed Description of the World View

This section, from verses 103 and 104 of the fourth chapter of the Yoga Shastra, describes the Jain concept of the world. It begins by discussing the characteristics of those who are not truly religious, and then moves on to explain the nature of the world itself.

**The Characteristics of Non-Religious People**

The text states that those who wear ornaments, carry tridents and axes, eat from broken pots, wear bells and anklets, and indulge in alcohol, meat, and women, cannot be considered truly religious. Similarly, those who follow the teachings of the Kulacharya, who eat roots, fruits, and leaves, and live in the forest with their wives and children, but do not understand the true meaning of the Jina's teachings, cannot be considered truly religious.

**The True Nature of Religion**

The text then explains that the true fruit of religion is liberation (moksha), not worldly gains. Just as a farmer plants seeds with the desire for grain, but also gets weeds and other unwanted plants, so too does a person who follows religion receive worldly benefits, but these are secondary to the ultimate goal of liberation.

**The World View**

The text then describes the world view of Jainism. It states that the world is made up of three realms: the lower realm (adho-lok), the middle realm (tiryak-lok), and the upper realm (urdhva-lok). The lower realm is further divided into seven hells, each with its own name and characteristics. These hells are surrounded by a vast ocean of solidified water (ghano-dhadhi), followed by a powerful wind (ghana-vat), and finally a weaker wind (tanu-vat). 

The text emphasizes that the world is constantly changing, with everything being in a state of flux. It is made up of substances that are constantly being created and destroyed. 

This description of the world view is meant to help the practitioner understand the nature of reality and to motivate them to strive for liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

## The Nature of the Universe

**This section discusses the structure of the universe according to Jain cosmology.**

**The Earth and its Surroundings:**

* The Earth is surrounded by three concentric rings: **Ghano-dhadhi** (dense air), **Ghanavat** (thick air), and **Tanuvat** (thin air).
* The **Ghano-dhadhi** is 20,000 yojanas thick, the **Ghanavat** is countless yojanas thick, and the **Tanuvat** is countless yojanas thicker than the **Ghanavat**.
* Beyond the **Tanuvat** lies the **Aakash** (space), which is countless thousands of yojanas thick.
* The thickness of these rings decreases gradually towards the outer edges, like the rings of a tree.
* The **Ghano-dhadhi** ring of the **Ratna-prabha** (a hell) is 6 yojanas wide, the **Ghanavat** ring is 4 yojanas wide, and the **Tanuvat** ring is 1 yojana wide.
* The **Ghano-dhadhi** ring of the **Ratna-prabha** has a thickness of one-third of a yojana, the **Ghanavat** ring has a thickness of one kos, and the **Tanuvat** ring has a thickness of one-third of a kos.
* The **Sharka-prabha** (another hell) has a similar structure, with the rings decreasing in size as they move upwards.
* The same pattern continues for the seven hells, with the rings decreasing in size as they move upwards.
* The first ring of the **Ghamma** (a hell) is one-third of a kos long, the second ring is one gao-kos long, and the last ring is one-third of a kos long.
* The rings of the **Vansha** (a hell) are 6 1/3 yojanas wide, 4 1/3 yojanas wide, and 10 1/3 yojanas wide respectively.
* The **Vansha** (a hell) is 122 1/3 yojanas wide, and beyond that lies the **Alok** (a region of darkness).
* The **Shaila** (a hell) is 6 yojanas wide, 52 1/3 yojanas wide, and 12 1/3 yojanas wide respectively.
* The **Shaila** (a hell) is 13 1/3 yojanas wide, and beyond that lies the **Alok** (a region of darkness).
* The **Pank-prabha** (a hell) is 7 yojanas wide, 52 1/3 yojanas wide, and 1 1/3 yojanas wide respectively.
* The **Pank-prabha** (a hell) is 14 yojanas wide, and beyond that lies the **Alok** (a region of darkness).
* The **Dhum-prabha** (a hell) is 7 1/3 yojanas wide, 52 1/3 yojanas wide, and 15 1/3 yojanas wide respectively.
* The **Dhum-prabha** (a hell) is 142 1/3 yojanas wide, and beyond that lies the **Alok** (a region of darkness).
* The **Tama-prabha** (a hell) is 72 1/3 yojanas wide, 52 1/3 yojanas wide, and 19 1/3 yojanas wide respectively.
* The **Maha-tama-prabha** (a hell) is 8 yojanas wide, 6 yojanas wide, and 2 yojanas wide respectively.
* The **Maha-tama-prabha** (a hell) is 16 yojanas wide, and beyond that lies the **Alok** (a region of darkness).
* The height of the Earth is equal to the width of the three rings (**Ghano-dhadhi**, **Ghanavat**, and **Tanuvat**) that surround it.

**The Shape of the Universe:**

* The universe is shaped like a **Vetrasana** (a type of seat) at the bottom, with a wider base and a narrower top.
* The middle part of the universe is shaped like a **Jhallari** (a type of musical instrument), and the top part is shaped like a **Mridanga** (a type of drum).
* The universe is made up of three parts: **Adho-lok** (lower world), **Tirya-g-lok** (intermediate world), and **Urddhva-lok** (upper world).
* The **Adho-lok** is shaped like an inverted **Sakora** (a type of vessel), the **Tirya-g-lok** is shaped like a **Thali** (a type of plate), and the **Urddhva-lok** is shaped like an upright **Mridanga** (a type of drum).

**Note:** The terms **yojana** and **kos** are units of measurement in ancient India.

## Description of Vyantaradevas and Jyotishkadevas

**Chapter 4, Light 105 of Yoga Shastra**

There are four celestial regions shaped like a sphere. Below them, in the upper part, there are four similar celestial regions called Ruchakpradeshas. Similarly, there are eight Ruchakpradeshas below the higher celestial regions. It is said that "There are eight Ruchakpradeshas in the middle part, similar to the Tirch Lok. From these, the directions and sub-directions have originated." (A. Ni. 42)

Below and above these Ruchakpradeshas, there is the Trilok, extending for nine hundred yojanas in each direction. Its thickness is eighteen hundred yojanas. After leaving nine hundred yojanas below the Trilok, there is the final part of the Lok. It is the Adholok, seven Rajas in length, containing seven Earths with the aforementioned characteristics.

The first Earth, Ratnaprabha, is one lakh eighty thousand yojanas high or thick. Leaving one thousand yojanas above and below it, there are the abodes of the Bhavanapatidevas within the remaining one lakh seventy-eight thousand yojanas. These Bhavanapatidevas are named Asura, Naga, Vidyut, Suparna, Agni, Vayu, Stanit, Udhi, Dvip, and Dikkumar, respectively. They are marked with the symbols of Chudamani, Serpent, Vajra, Garuda, Pot, Horse, Vardhaman, Crocodile, Lion, and Elephant, respectively.

To the south and north of these Bhavanapatidevas, there are two Indras each, arranged systematically. The Asurakumar Devas have two Indras named Chamendra and Balindra. The Nagakumar Devas have two Indras named Dharanendra and Bhutananda. The Vidyutkumar Devas have two Indras named Hari and Harisah. The Suparnakumar Devas have two Indras named Venudeva and Venudali. The Agnikumar Devas have two Indras named Agnishikha and Agnimaanav. The Vayukumar Devas have two Indras named Velamb and Prabhanjan. The Stanitkumar Devas have two Indras named Saghoṣa and Mahaghosa. The Udhikumar Devas have two Indras named Jalakant and Jalaprabha. The Dvipkumar Devas have two Indras named Purna and Vashishtha. The Dikkumar Devas have two Indras named Amit and Amitvahan.

Above this Ratnaprabha Earth, at a height of one thousand yojanas, leaving one hundred yojanas above and below, there are eight types of Vyantaradevas residing in the remaining eight hundred yojanas. These are Pishacha, Bhut, Yaksha, Rakshasa, Kinnara, Kimpurusha, Mahoraga, and Gandharva, respectively. They are marked with the symbols of Kadambavriksha, Sulasavriksha, Vatavriksha, Khatwang-Tapas instrument, Ashokvriksha, Champakvriksha, Nagavriksha, and Tumbaruvriksha, respectively. These Vyantaradevas reside in the Trilok, and they also have their own cities. They also have two Indras each, arranged in the south and north directions. They are as follows:

* Pishachas: Kal and Mahakal
* Bhuts: Surup and Pratirup
* Yakshas: Purnabhadra and Manibhadra
* Rakshasas: Bhim and Mahabhim
* Kinnaras: Kinnara and Kimpurusha
* Kimpurushas: Satpurusha and Mahapurusha
* Mahoragas: Atikaya and Mahakaya
* Gandharvas: Giterati and Giteyasha

In the same Ratnaprabha, leaving ten yojanas above and below the first hundred yojanas, there are eight types of Vyantaranikayadevas, including Anapni, Panapni, etc., residing in the remaining eighty yojanas, arranged in the south and north directions. Each of them also has two Indras.

Above the flat surface of the Ratnaprabha Earth, at a height of seven hundred ninety yojanas, is the lower region of the Jyotishkadevas. Above it, at a height of ten yojanas, is the Sun. Further ahead, at a distance of eighty yojanas, is the Moon. Above it, at a height of twenty yojanas, are the stars and planets. Thus, the total thickness of the Jyotirlok is one hundred and ten yojanas. It revolves in a circular manner in all directions, excluding the Pole Star, without touching the Meru of Jambudvipa at a distance of eleven hundred twenty-one yojanas and without touching the end of the Lok at a distance of eleven hundred eleven yojanas.

It is said that "The Jyotishchakra revolves outside both the Meru mountain and the Alok, at a distance of eleven hundred twenty-one and eleven hundred eleven yojanas, respectively." The Swati Nakshatra is at the top, and the Bharani Nakshatra is at the bottom. The Mula Nakshatra is to the south of all, and the Abhijit Nakshatra is to the north of all.

In this Jambudvipa, there are two Moons and two Suns. In the Lavanasamudra, there are four Moons and four Suns. In the Dhaatki Khand, there are twelve Moons and twelve Suns. In the Kalodhi Samudra, there are forty-two Moons and forty-two Suns. In the Pushkaravarardha Dvipa, there are seventy-two Moons and seventy-two Suns. Thus, there are a total of one hundred thirty-two Moons and one hundred thirty-two Suns in the Martyalok. There are eighty-eight planets, twenty-eight Nakshatras, more than sixty-six thousand nine hundred seventy-five stars, and countless families of each Moon.

The Moon's chariot is fifty-six by sixty-one yojanas in length and width. The Sun's chariot is forty-eight by sixty-one yojanas in length and width. The planet's chariot is half a yojana. The Nakshatra's chariot is one Kos. The star's chariot is half a Kos for those with the longest lifespan and five hundred Dhanushya for those with the shortest lifespan. The thickness of all chariots is half their width. These chariots are located in the Manushya Kshetra, which is forty-five lakh yojanas in size. The Moon...

Vyantara Devas and Jyotishka Devas

According to the Yogashastra, in front of the Vimana of the fourth Prakasha, there are a lion in the south, an elephant in the west, and a horse in the north. The Sun and Moon have sixteen thousand Ajnapaalaka Abhiyogika Devas. The planets have eight thousand, the nakshatras have four thousand, and the stars have two thousand Abhiyogika families. Even though they have divine status and divine merit, due to their Karmic associations with the Moon and other planets, they manifest in those forms. Beyond the Manushottara mountain, the number of auspicious-hued planets, nakshatras, and stars with the shape of a bell increases immensely, numbering countless. They reside in rows a hundred thousand Yojanas apart from the self-arisen Ramansamudra.

In the middle of Jambudvipa are the beautiful, ever-expanding concentric islands and oceans, and finally the self-arisen Ramansamudra. In the center of Jambudvipa is the Meru mountain, hidden a thousand Yojanas below the earth, like a golden platter. It is 99,000 Yojanas high, 1,009,000 Yojanas wide at the base. In the underworld, it extends 100 Yojanas, in the middle world 1,800 Yojanas, and in the upper world 98,100 Yojanas, thus dividing the three worlds. It has four forests - Bhadrashaala, Nandana, Saumanas, and Paanduka. The first section is filled with pure earth, rock, diamond, and stones for a thousand Yojanas. The second section of 63,000 Yojanas is abundant in silver, gold, gems, and crystal. The third section of 36,000 Yojanas is rich in gold. Its pinnacle of 40 Yojanas is made of Vaidurya gems, 12 Yojanas at the base, 8 Yojanas in the middle, and 4 Yojanas at the top.

## Description of Jambudvipa and Other Continents

**Chapter 4, Verse 105 of the Yoga Shastra**

There are 28,000 rivers in Jambudvipa, 56,000 each in Haritaka and Haritaki, and 500,000 in Shita and Shitota. These 32,000 rivers merge together. Understand that the rivers of the north are similar to the rivers flowing south. The total length of Bharat Kshetra is 526/9 yojanas. After that, the mountains and regions in Mahavideha are double in length, and so on. Each region and mountain in the north is similar to the south.

**19**

In Mahavideha, north of Nishdha mountain and south, west, and east of Meru, there are two Nishdha mountains called Vidyut Prabha and Saumanas. They are surrounded by elephant-shaped mountains and are separated by the Shitota river. There are five ponds each, close to each other, and ten Kanchan mountains adorning them. On the east and west banks of the Shitota river, there is Devakuru, adorned with Vichitrakuta and Chitrakuta, extending a thousand yojanas upwards and downwards, and half that distance upwards. It is 11842 2/9 yojanas in size. North and south of Meru mountain are Gandhamadana and Malaya mountains, shaped like elephants. They are separated by the Shita river, which flows between Meru and Neel mountains, and there are five ponds close to each other. Adorned with Vichitrakuta and Chitrakuta, golden Yamaka mountains, and with a hundred Kanchan mountains on both banks of the Shita river, is Uttarakuru. East of Devakuru and Uttarakuru is Purva Mahavideha, and west of them is Paschim Mahavideha. In Purva Videha, there are sixteen victories, separated by rivers and mountains suitable for a Chakravarti, which do not allow entry to each other. Similarly, there are sixteen victories in Paschim Videha.

In the middle of Bharat Kshetra, touching the sea on both the east and west sides, dividing Bharat into two parts, south and north, is the Vaitalya mountain, adorned with two caves called Tamisra and Khandrapata. It is one and a quarter yojanas underground, fifty yojanas wide, and twenty-five yojanas high. Near this mountain, on the south and north sides, are rows of Vidhadharas, ten yojanas high and ten yojanas wide. There are fifty cities in the south, including the region, and sixty cities in the north. Above the rows of Vidhadharas, on both sides, after ten yojanas, are rows of Tiryanjrimbhrik Vyantar Devas. They have their abodes in these rows. Above the Vyantar rows, at a height of five yojanas, are nine peaks. Understand that the same description applies to the Airavata Kshetra, which is similar to the Vaitalya mountain.

Around Jambudvipa, there is a vajra-like Jagati, eight yojanas high, like a wall. It is twelve yojanas long at the base. It is eight yojanas wide in the middle and four yojanas high above. Above that is a place called Jalakataka, two gao high, where the Vidhyadharas play. Above that is a place called Padmavaravedika, the land of enjoyment for the Devas. In each direction of this Jagati, there are four gates called Vijay, Vaijayanta, Jayanta, and Aparajit. Between the Himavan and Mahahimavan mountains is the Vaitalya mountain, called Shabdapata. Between Rukmi and Shikhari is Vikatapata. Between Mahahimavan and Nishdha is Gandhapata. Between Neel and Rukmi is Malya mountain. All these mountains are a thousand yojanas high and shaped like a Pali.

Jambudvipa is surrounded by a salt ocean, twice its size, two lakh yojanas wide (ten thousand yojanas wide in the middle), a thousand yojanas deep, and forty-nine thousand yojanas wide on both sides. Due to the increase in the middle, the water extends sixteen thousand yojanas high. Above that, the water rises and falls two gao during the day and night. In the middle of this ocean, in all four directions, are four vajra-like Patala Kalash, a thousand yojanas thick, ten thousand yojanas wide at the mouth and base, called Vadvamukha in the east, Keyupa in the south, Yupa in the west, and Ishvara in the north. They are the abodes of the Kal, Mahakal, Velamb, and Prabhanjan Devas. They are deep, like pits, and hold air. They have three parts of water. There are other smaller Kalash, a thousand yojanas below, with a mouth of a hundred yojanas and a thickness of ten yojanas. They have 333/1 water in the upper part, air and water in the middle, and air in the lower part. To stop the tide of water entering Jambudvipa, there are 7884 Devas. To stop the inner tide, there are 42,000 Naga Kumar Devas. To stop the outer tide, there are 72,000 Devas. To stop the tide peak, there are 60,000 Devas.

Description of Jambudvipa and other islands and regions

The fourth light of Yoga Shastra, verse 105, mentions four Velandhar Devas who reside on four mountains: Suvarna, Ankaratna, Chandi and Sphatik. These mountains are the abodes of the four guardian deities: Shivak, Shankh, Manahshil and Gostup. Their heights are 1721 yojanas, with a base diameter of 1022 yojanas and a top diameter of 424 yojanas. Above them are their respective palaces. Their guardians are Karkotak, Kardam, Kailash and Arunaprabha. Karkotak, Vudyujjihva, Kailash and Arunaprabha are the names of the abodes of these guardians, which are located on small, tide-resistant, all-gem-studded mountains. In the Vidishas, there is a Chandradvipa, 12,000 yojanas long and wide, and a Suryadvipa of the same size. Gautamdvipa and Susthitaavasa are also of the same size. There are also Chandra and Surya-related islands in the inner and outer salt seas. All these regions have palaces, and the salt sea is filled with salt water.

Surrounding the salt sea is a circular Dhaatki-khand, twice its size, measuring four lakh yojanas. The Meru and other Varshadhar mountains and regions are described in Jambudvipa. It is important to know that the Dhaatki-khand is larger than these. Due to the presence of two long, sloping mountains in the south and north, the Dhaatki-khand is divided into two parts. The names and numbers of the mountains and other features of Jambudvipa, as well as the eastern and western parts of the Dhaatki-khand, are arranged like the spokes of a wheel. The region between the sloping mountains, including the Kalodadhi and the salt sea, which touch the peaks of the Nishdhadi mountains of Jambudvipa, is located in the middle of the wheel. Surrounding the Dhaatki-khand is a circular Kalodadhi sea, eight lakh yojanas in diameter.

Surrounding the Kalodadhi sea is a circular Pushkaravaradvipa, twice its size. Half of this island is the Manushya-kshetra. The number of regions, mountains, etc. in the Pushkaravaradvipa is the same as the number of Meru and sloping mountains in the Dhaatki-khand. The area of the Pushkaravaradvipa is twice the size of the Dhaatki-khand. There are four smaller Merus in the Dhaatki-khand and Pushkaravaradvipa, each 15,000 yojanas shorter than the Mahameru, measuring 85,000 yojanas in height. Their diameter at the base is 600 yojanas less than the Mahameru. This is the first kand. The second kand is the same size as the large Meru. The third kand is 7,000 yojanas shorter, measuring 56,000 yojanas. The fourth kand is 8,000 yojanas shorter, measuring 28,000 yojanas. The Bhadrashilvana is the same size as the large Meru mountain. The Nandana vana is 55,500 yojanas high and has a diameter of 500 yojanas. Above it, at a height of 28,000 yojanas, is the Padunkavana, with a diameter of 494 yojanas. The diameter at the base and the depth of the Padunkavana are the same as the large Meru, and its peak is also similar. This entire region, consisting of two and a half islands and seas, is called the Manushya-kshetra. It contains five Merus, 35 regions, 30 Varshadhar mountains, five Devakurus, five Uttarakurus and 160 Vijayas.

Just as a fort surrounds a city for its protection, the Manushya-kshetra is surrounded by a golden Manushottara mountain. This mountain is 1721 yojanas high, 430 yojanas and one kos deep in the ground, 1022 yojanas wide at the base, 723 yojanas wide in the middle and 424 yojanas wide at the top. No human being is ever born or dies in the region beyond this mountain. Even if a liberated Charan or Vidyadhar crosses this mountain, they do not die there. Therefore, it is called the Manushottara mountain. Beyond this mountain, there is no rain, fire, clouds, lightning, rivers, time, or environment. Humans are born in the 35 regions of the Manushya-kshetra, including the five Devakurus, five Uttarakurus and the inner islands. Through the knowledge of Sanharanavidya and the practice of Riddhiyoga, all humans reach the peak of Meru and both seas in the two and a half islands. These are the people of the Bharat-kshetra, these are the people of the Himavat-kshetra, these are the people of Jambudvipa, these are the people of the salt sea, and these are the people of the inner islands. Humans are identified based on the division of islands and seas. There are two types of humans: Aryas and Mlechchas. Aryas are born in 25 and a half countries. Countries are identified by their specific cities. They are as follows:

1. Magadhadesh, identified by the city of Rajagriha.
2. Angadesh, identified by the city of Champa.
3. Bangadesh, identified by the city of Tamralipti.
4. Kalingadesh, identified by the city of Kanchanpur.

## Description of the Inter-Continents

**Chapter Four, Light of Yoga, Verse 105**

The following twenty-six countries are known as **Aaryadesh**:

1. **Aachchhadesh** from **Varunanagari**
2. **Dashaarnadesh** from **Mruttikavati Nagari**
3. **Chedi** from **Shuktimati Nagari**
4. **Sindhusauvir** from **Vitabhay**
5. **Shurasen** from **Mathura**
6. **Bhang** from **Papa**
7. **Varta** from **Mashapuri**
8. **Kunal** from **Shravasti**
9. **Latdesh** from **Kotivarsh**
10. **Kaikey** from **Shwetaambika Nagari** (half the country)

These twenty-six countries are called **Aaryadesh** because **Jineshwaradev**, **Chakravarti**, **Baldev**, and **Vasudeva** are born in these lands.

Countries like **Shak**, **Yavan**, etc. are called **Anaryadesh**. These are:

* **Shak**, **Yavan**, **Shabar**, **Kayamrund**, **Udd**, **Gon**, **Pakvan**, **Aakhyanak**, **Hoon**, **Romash**, **Paras**, **Khan**, **Kaushik**, **Dubali**, **Lakush**, **Bukkas**, **Andhra**, **Pulind**, **Kraunch**, **Bhramara**, **Ruchi**, **Kapot**, **Chin**, **Chanchuk**, **Malav**, **Dravid**, **Kulath**, **Kaikey**, **Kirat**, **Hayamukha**, **Swaramukha**, **Gajamukha**, **Turagamukha**, **Mendhamukha**, **Hayakarna**, **Gajakarna**, etc. and many other **Anarya** people. These people are **sinful**, **fierce**, **cruel**, **lacking remorse**, and have never even heard the word **Dharma** in their dreams.

In addition to these, **Yauglik** people born in the **Antaradweep** are also considered **Anarya**.

There are **fifty-six Antaradweep** as follows:

* **Uruuk**: The first **Antaradweep** is called **Uruuk**, located in the **Eeshankon** of the **Lavanasamudra** (salt sea), three hundred yojanas deep and three hundred yojanas wide, situated in front of and behind the **Himalaya Mountains** in the four **Vidisha** (directions) - **Eeshana**, etc. The inhabitants of this **Antaradweep** are called **Uruuk**.
* **Aabhashik**: The first **Antaradweep** in the **Agnikon** (south-east) is called **Aabhashik**, located three hundred yojanas deep in the **Lavanasamudra**, three hundred yojanas wide, inhabited by **Aabhashik** people.
* **Laangoolik**: The first **Antaradweep** in the **Nairityakon** (south-west) is called **Laangoolik**, located three hundred yojanas deep in the **Lavanasamudra**, three hundred yojanas wide, inhabited by **Laangoolik** people.
* **Vaishaanik**: The first **Antaradweep** in the **Vayavyakon** (north-west) is called **Vaishaanik**, located three hundred yojanas deep in the **Lavanasamudra**, three hundred yojanas wide, inhabited by **Vaishaanik** people.

After these, there are four more **Antaradweep** called **Hayakarna**, **Gajakarna**, **Gokarna**, and **Shashkulikaarna**, located four hundred yojanas further, each four hundred yojanas wide.

Then, there are four more **Antaradweep** called **Aadarshamukha**, **Meshamukha**, **Hayamukha**, and **Gajamukha**, located five hundred yojanas further, each five hundred yojanas wide.

After these, there are four more **Antaradweep** called **Ashvamukha**, **Hastimukha**, **Singhamukha**, and **Vyaghramukha**, located six hundred yojanas further, each six hundred yojanas wide.

Then, there are four more **Antaradweep** called **Ashvakarna**, **Singhakarn**, **Hastikarn**, and **Karnpravaran**, located seven hundred yojanas further in the **Lavanasamudra**, each seven hundred yojanas wide.

After these, there are four more **Antaradweep** called **Ulkamukha**, **Vidhyutjihm**, **Meshamukha**, and **Vidhyuint**, located eight hundred yojanas further, each eight hundred yojanas wide.

Then, there are four more **Antaradweep** called **Ghandant**, **Goodhdant**, **Shreshthdant**, and **Shuddhdant**, located nine hundred yojanas further in the **Lavanasamudra**, each nine hundred yojanas wide.

**Yauglik** people are born in these **Antaradweep**. Their lifespan is a fraction of a **Palyaopam**, and their bodies are eight hundred dhanushya (bows) tall.

Similarly, the **Shikhari Parvat**, which divides the **Airavat Kshetra**, also has twenty-eight **Antaradweep** in the same order of **Vidisha** and names.

Combining all these, there are **fifty-six Antaradweep**.

After the **Manushottar Parvat**, there is the **Pushkaravaradweep**, surrounded by the **Pushkarod Samudra**, which is twice the size of the **Pushkaravaradweep**. After this, there is the **Ksheeravaradweep** and its surrounding sea, followed by the **Ghritavaradweep** and its surrounding sea, and then the **Ikshuvaradweep** and its surrounding sea.

After these, there is the eighth **Nandiswaradweep**, which is 1638400000 yojanas wide. This **Antaradweep** has beautiful gardens that rival the **Devalok**, filled with various types of flowers and trees. These gardens are adorned by the arrival of **Devas** who are focused on worshipping the image of **Jineshwaradev**, and are made even more beautiful by the gathering of **Devas** who engage in various games according to their desires.

In the middle of this **Antaradweep**, there are four **Anjangiri** mountains, each 84000 yojanas tall, resembling small **Meru** mountains with the color of **Anjan** (collyrium). These mountains are more than ten thousand yojanas wide at the base and one thousand yojanas wide at the top. Their names are **Devaraman**, **Nityodyot**, **Swayamprabha**, and **Ramaneya**.

On top of these mountains, there is a **Jinamandir** (Jain temple), one hundred yojanas long, fifty yojanas wide, and seventy-two yojanas tall. This temple has four entrances, each sixteen yojanas tall, eight yojanas wide, and eight yojanas deep, named after and inhabited by **Devas**, **Asuras**, **Nagas**, and **Suparnas**. Inside the temple, there is a platform sixteen yojanas long, sixteen yojanas wide, and eight yojanas tall. On top of this platform, there is a **Devachhandak**, slightly larger than the platform. In each direction of the **Devachhandak**, there are images of **Rishabha**,

## Description of the Nandidharadvipa, a Non-Aryan Land

The fourth light of the Yoga Shastra, verse 105, describes the Nandidharadvipa. It states that there are four images of Vardhamana, named Varisena and Chandranana, seated in the Paryankasana posture. Each image is accompanied by 108 other images, two Yaksha images, two Bhut images, two Kalashdhar images, and two images of gods holding Chamaras. These images are adorned with garlands of flowers, bells, pots, incense burners, Ashtamangal, toranas, flags, flowers, Angerikas, mirrors, curtains, umbrellas, and seats. The floor of the Jinalaya is covered with beautiful, fine, golden sand. The front mandapa of the Jinamandir, the size of the temple itself, is adorned with sixteen full Kalashas. It also has a Prekshamandapa, Akshavata-Gavaksha, Manipeethika, Stupa, Chaityavriksha, Indra-dhvaja, and a well, all arranged in a specific order.

There are four wells in each of the four directions of the Anjanagiri mountain. Their names are: 1. Nandishena, 2. Amogha, 3. Gostupa, 4. Sudarshana; 1. Nandottra, 2. Nanda, 3. Sunanda, 4. Nandivardhana; 1. Bhadra, 2. Vishala, 3. Kumuda, 4. Pundarikin; 1. Vijaya, 2. Vaijayanti, 3. Jayanti, 4. Aparajita. After five hundred yojanas from each well, there is a garden, a lakh yojanas long and five hundred yojanas wide, named Ashoka, Saptachanda, Champaka, Amra, etc. In the middle of the wells, there is a Dhadhimukh mountain made of crystal. It is sixty-four thousand yojanas high, a thousand yojanas deep, ten thousand yojanas wide at the base, and the same width at the top. It is shaped like a Palyanka. Some say there are two mountains in the middle of each well, making a total of thirty-two. The Dhadhimukh and Ratikara mountains are similar to the Anjanagiri mountain in terms of temples. There are four Ratikara mountains in the Vidisha of the island. They are ten thousand yojanas long and wide, a thousand yojanas high, made of all jewels, and shaped like a Jhallari. There are eight Mahadevi images of Ishaneendra on the two mountains in the north, and eight Mahadevi images of Shakrendra in the south. There are eight capitals in each direction, a lakh yojanas in size, each adorned with a Jinamandir. Their names are: Sujata, Saumansa, Archi, Mali, Prabhakara, Padma, Shiva, Shuchi; Anjana, Bhutavantasa, Gostupa, Sudarshana, Amala, Apsara, Rohini, Navami; Ratna, Ratnocchaya, Sarvaratna, Ratnasamchaya; Vasu, Vasumitra, Vasubhaga, Vasundhara; Nandottra, Nanda, Uttarakuru, Devakuru, Krishna, Krishna Raji, Rama, Ramarakshita. The capital of Agni-kona is also to be understood in the same way. On auspicious days, the all-wealthy gods, along with their families, come to the Jinamandir, worshipped by gods, Asuras, and Vidhyadharas, and celebrate the Ashtahnika Mahotsava with joy.

We praise the twenty Jinalayasa on the Anjanagiri mountain and the sixteen on the Dhadhimukh mountain, making a total of thirty-six. There are also thirty-two Jinalayasa on the Ratikara mountain, making a total of sixty-eight on the peak of the mountain. We also praise the thirty-two Jinalayasa in the capital of Indrani. Some believe there are sixteen Jinalayasa. We praise them as well. The meaning of the verses of the ancient teachers, which support this meaning, is as follows:

The eighth island, called Nandidhvara, is 1638400000 yojanas in size. It is a place where the community of gods always enjoys pleasure and devotion to the Lord. There are four mountains in each of the four directions, shaped like buffalo horns, black in color, 94000 yojanas high, a thousand yojanas at the base, ten thousand yojanas at the ground level, 9400 yojanas in the upper part, and a thousand yojanas wide at the top. The four mountains are: Devaramana in the east, Nityodyota in the south, Swayamprabha in the west, and Ramaniya in the north. These mountains are a lakh yojanas away from the Anjan mountains. There are wells in each of the four directions, a thousand yojanas deep, filled with pure water without fish. The names of the four wells in each direction are: 1. Nandishena, 2. Amogha, 3. Gostupa, 4. Sudarshana; 5. Nandottra, 6. Nanda, 7. Sunanda, 8. Nandivardhana; 9. Bhadra, 10. Vishala, 11. Kumuda, 12. Pundarikin; 13. Vijaya, 14. Vaijayanti, 15. Jayanti, 16. Aparajita. After five hundred yojanas from the wells, there is a forest, a lakh yojanas long and five hundred yojanas wide. The names of the forests are: Ashoka in the east, Saptaparna in the south, Champaka in the west, and Amra in the north. In the middle of the wells, there are sixteen Dhadhimukh mountains, shaped like bowls, made of crystal, ten thousand yojanas wide, a thousand yojanas at the base, and sixty-four thousand yojanas high. On the Anjanagiri and Dhadhimukh mountains, there are Jinamandirs, a hundred yojanas wide, seventy-two yojanas high, beautifully decorated, with various types of decorations, dances, songs, music, and hundreds of types of devotion, along with toranas, flags, and Mangalas. There are forts and gates in the buildings named after gods, Asuras, Naga-kumars, and Suparna-kumars. The height of the gates is sixteen yojanas, and the width is eight yojanas. There are Kalashas and other things on each gate. There are also mandapas, Prekshamandapas, Gavakshas, Manipeethas, Stupas, Pratima-ashtakas, Chaitya-vrikshas, etc.

## Description of Nandishwar Island and Devalok

**Chapter 4, Verse 105 of Yoga Shastra**

Adorned with flags and wells, the Jain temple's sanctum sanctorum houses a **Manipithika** (jewel pedestal) 8 yojanas high, 16 yojanas long, and 8 yojanas wide.  Above this is a **Devachhand** (divine canopy) made of jewels, even larger in size.  Within it reside 108 eternal **Paryakasan** (seated) images of the **Jineshwara** (Jain Tirthankaras):

1. **Rishabha**
2. **Vardhaman**
3. **Chandrasan**
4. **Varishen**

Each image is accompanied by two **Nagakumar** (snake princes), two **Yaksha** (guardian deities), two **Bhoot** (spirits), and two **Kundadhar** (water-bearers).  On either side are two figures holding **chamar** (fly whisks), and behind each image is a figure holding a **chhatra** (umbrella).  Also present are **Bhadrasan** (auspicious seat), **Mangalpushp** (auspicious flower), **Angeri** (incense burner), **Patlak** (cloth), and **Chhatraasan** (umbrella seat), along with a **ghanta** (bell), **chandan ghanta** (sandalwood bell), **gar** (incense), and **darpan** (mirror).

As mentioned in the scriptures, there are two **Ratikara** mountains for every two wells.  On these 32 mountains, there are 32 Jain temples, as previously described.  On auspicious days, **Vidhyadhar** (celestial beings) and **Devatas** (deities) celebrate festivals here, offering **vandana** (salutations), **namaskaar** (prostrations), **stuti** (praises), and **puja** (worship).  Such **Jinpratima** (Jain images) reside within these temples.

A **Ratikara** mountain, resembling a **jhallari** (a type of ornament) and made of jewels, stands 1,000 yojanas high and 10,000 yojanas wide.  It adorns the **Vidisha** (central region) of the island.  In each of the four directions of this mountain, extending for a lakh yojanas, are eight capitals of **Shakra** (Indra) and **Ishan** (Indra), the chief queens of **Jambudweep**.  Around each capital is a fort made of pure **mani** (jewel) and within it is a Jain temple adorned with exquisite and beautiful jewel-encrusted images.  We praise these temples, located on 20 and 52 **girishikhar** (mountain peaks).  I bow to the 32 or 16 Jain temples that reside in the capitals of the **Indraani** (Indra's queens).

Surrounding Nandishwar Island is the **Nandishwar Samudra** (ocean), a circular ring.  Beyond it lies **Arunadweep** (Arun Island) and **Arunasamudra** (Arun Ocean).  Further out are **Arunavaradweep** (Arunavar Island) and **Arunavarsamudra** (Arunavar Ocean), followed by **Arunaabhasadweep** (Arunaabhas Island) and **Arunaabhasasamudra** (Arunaabhas Ocean).  Next come **Kundaladweep** (Kundala Island) and **Kundalasamudra** (Kundala Ocean), followed by **Ruchkadweep** (Ruchka Island) and **Ruchkasamudra** (Ruchka Ocean).  In this manner, there are countless islands and oceans, each twice as large as the previous one, with names like **Prashasht** (wide).  Finally, there is the **Swayambhurmanasamudra** (Self-born Ocean).

Of these islands and oceans, only **Bharat**, **Airavat**, and **Mahavideh** are **karmabhoomi** (lands of karma), excluding **Devakuru** and **Uttarakuru** (two of the seven continents).  The water of **Kalodadhi** (Black Ocean), **Pushkarasamudra** (Lotus Ocean), and **Swayambhurmanasamudra** (Self-born Ocean) tastes like ordinary water.  The water of **Lavanasamudra** (Salt Ocean) tastes like salt.  The water of **Varunodhadhisamudra** (Varuna Ocean) tastes like various types of wine.  The water of **Kshirasamudra** (Milk Ocean) tastes like cow's milk mixed with one-fourth part of sugar and ghee.  The water of **Ghritasamudra** (Ghee Ocean) tastes like freshly cooked ghee.  The water of the remaining oceans tastes like a mixture of one-third part of freshly squeezed sugarcane juice with cinnamon, **tamalpatra** (bay leaf), cardamom, and **nagakeasar** (mesua ferrea).

**Lavanasamudra** (Salt Ocean), **Kalodadhi** (Black Ocean), and **Swayambhurmanasamudra** (Self-born Ocean) are abundant with fish, turtles, etc., but the other oceans are not.  In **Jambudweep** (Jambudvipa), there are always four **Jighnya** (inferior) Tirthankaras, **Chakravarti** (universal monarchs) **Baldev** and **Vasudeva**.  There are also 34 **Utkrisht** (superior) Tirthankaras and 30 **Chakravarti**.  In **Dhatukikhand** and **Pushkarardhakhand**, there are twice as many.

Above the **Tiryaglok** (world of transmigration), there are 12 **Devalok** (heavenly realms) extending for 200 yojanas and seven **Raj-praman** (royal measures).  These are:

1. **Soudharm**
2. **Ishan**
3. **Sanatkumar**
4. **Mahendra**
5. **Brahmalok**
6. **Lantk**
7. **Mahashukra**
8. **Sahasrar**
9. **Anat**
10. **Pranat**
11. **Aran**
12. **Achyut**

Above these are nine **Graiveyak** (heavenly realms), followed by **Vijay**, **Vaijayant**, **Jayant**, and **Aparajit**, in the order of east, south, west, and north.  In the center is **Sarvarth Siddha** (the realm of perfect beings).  Above this is **Ishtapraagbhar** (slightly inclined towards the east), a land 12 yojanas high and 45 lakh yojanas wide.  This is the **Siddhashila** (stone of the liberated).  Above this, in the fourth part of the third **gau** (region) and the sixth part of the fourth **gau**, up to the end of the **lok** (universe), reside the **Siddha** (liberated souls).

From the **Samabhootal** (level ground), **Soudharm** and **Ishan** are one and a half **Raj Lok** (royal realms) away.  **Sanatkumar** and **Mahendra** are two and a half **Raj Lok** away.  **Sahasrar** is five **Raj Lok** away.  **Achyut** is six **Raj Lok** away.  The end of the universe is seven **Raj Lok** away.  The **Viman** (aerial chariot) of **Soudharm** and **Ishan** is round like the **Chandramandal** (lunar orb).  **Shakra** (Indra) rules the southern half and **Ishan** (Indra) rules the northern half.  The same applies to **Sanatkumar** and **Mahendra**.  **Sanatkumar** (Indra) rules the southern half and **Mahendra** (Indra) rules the northern half.  Above these, in the middle of the **Urdhvalok** (upper world), in the region resembling the elbow of a **Lokapurush** (cosmic being), is **Brahmalok**.  Its Indra is **Brahmendra**.  In one part of this realm reside the **Lokantik** (heavenly beings) named **Saraswat**, **Aditya**, **Vahni**, **Arun**, **Gardatoy**, **Tushit**, **Avyabadh**, **Marut**, and **Arishta**.  Above this is **Lantk** and its Indra, **Lantkendr**.  Above this, **Sudharm** and **Ishan**...

## Description of Devaloka

**Chapter Four, Light of Yoga, Verse 105:**

The Devaloka of Anata and Pranata is crescent-shaped and has a Pranata-kalpa. It has one Indra for both kalpas of the same name. Above it, there is a similar crescent-shaped, round Aran and Achyuta. There, the Achyuta-kalpa residents have one Indra for both kalpas of the same name. All the Devas in the Devalokas above are Ahindra. The first two kalpas are based on Ghanodadhi. The next kalpa is based on Vayu. The following three kalpas are based on Ghanodadhi and Ghanavat. The kalpas above are based on Akash.

These kalpa-born Devas are divided into ten categories: Indra, Samanika, Trayastrimsa, Parishadya, Atma-rakshaka, Lokapala, Sainik, Prakirnaka, Abhiyogi, and Kilbishika. Indra is the master of the first nine categories. Samanika Devas are like the head, father, guru, and Upadhyaya, but they lack the Indra position. Trayastrimsa Devas are like ministers and priests. Parishadya Devas are like friends. Atma-rakshaka Devas are like bodyguards. Lokapala Devas are like Kotwal (police officers) or messengers. Anik Devas are like soldiers. Their leader is like a general. They should also be considered Anik Devas. Prakirnaka Devas are like city, people, and country residents. Abhiyogi Devas are like servants who obey orders. Kilbishika Devas are like outcasts.

In Vyantar and Jyotishka Devalokas, there are no Trayastrimsa and Lokapala Devas. All other Devas are present there.

There are 3.2 million Vimanas in Saudharma Devaloka, 2.8 million in Ishana, 1.2 million in Sanatkumar, 800,000 in Mahendra, 400,000 in Brahmaloka, 50,000 in Lantaka, 40,000 in Shukra, 6,000 in Sahasrar, 400 in Anata and Pranata, 300 in Aran and Achyuta, 111 in the first three Graveyaka, 107 in the middle three Graveyaka, 100 in the upper three Graveyaka, and only 5 in Anuttar. In total, there are 8,497,023 Vimanas.

The four Anuttar Vimanas residents, including Vijaya, have two births remaining. The Sarvarthasiddha Devas have only one birth remaining.

From Saudharma Devaloka to Sarvarthasiddha, the Devas' lifespan, position, influence, happiness, radiance, Leshya, purity, sense objects, and Avadhijnana increase progressively. Their speed, body attachments, and pride decrease progressively. Breathing is the same for all, with a low frequency. The Bhavanapati and other Devas eat after seven stokas and fast for one upavasa. The Palyopama-sthiti Devas breathe once a day and eat every two to nine days. Devas with a lifespan of one Sagaropama breathe once every Pakshika and eat every thousand years. Devas generally have seven Vedaniya Karmas. If they have Asata Vedaniya Karma, it lasts only for a short time, not longer.

Devis are born only up to the second Ishana Devaloka. However, they can go up to the twelfth Achyuta Devaloka. Other intoxicated tapaswis and Jyotishka Devas can go up to the Jyotishka Devaloka. Panchendriya Tiryanchas can go up to the eighth Sahasrar kalpa. Human Shravakas can go up to the twelfth Achyuta Devaloka. Those who accept the character-mark of Shri Jinendra Bhagavan, those who are Mithyadrishti, those who follow the true path, can go up to the ninth Graveyaka. The fourteen Purvadhars can go from Brahmaloka to Sarvarthasiddha. Sadhus and Shravakas with unbroken vows can be born in the lowest Saudharma Devaloka.

Devas from Bhavanavasi to the second Ishana Devaloka enjoy sexual pleasure through their bodies. These Devas are like humans with entangled Karmas, deeply attached to sexual pleasure, immersed in it with intensity, and enjoy the touch of their bodies, finding pleasure in it. Devas in the third and fourth kalpas enjoy only touch pleasure. Devas in the fifth and sixth kalpas are satisfied by seeing the form of Devis. Devas in the seventh and eighth Devalokas are satisfied by hearing the voice of Devis. Devas in the ninth to twelfth Devalokas are satisfied by mentally thinking about Devis. Devas above that are not satisfied by any of these.

**Notes:**

1. There are different opinions on this topic.
2. There are also differences of opinion on this topic. The limit is up to the eighth Devaloka.
3. Mental thinking about Devis is considered the same as their arrival.

The special nature of the world, the rare feeling of enlightenment.

From verse 106 to 107 of the fourth light of Yoga Shastra, it is not possible to have sexual intercourse in any way, but the gods who do not preach are infinitely more blissful than the gods who preach. In this way, there are three divisions of the world - Adholka, Tiryanka and Urdhvaloka. In the middle part of this world, there is a Trisanadi, which is fourteen Raj Lok Praman long and wide, up and down, in which Tris and stationary beings live, and outside the Trisanadi, there are only stationary beings. ||105||

Now the special nature of the world is being told. 432. It is not created by anyone, nor is it held by anyone. It is self-existent, without a base, but situated in the sky. ||106|| Meaning: This world has not been created by anyone, nor has it been held by anyone. It is self-existent from time immemorial and is situated in the sky without a base. ||106|| Explanation: None of the nature, God, Vishnu, Brahma, Purusha, etc. have created this world (universe). Nature cannot be an agent because it is inanimate. God, etc. do not have any purpose, so they are not agents either. If someone says - they created the world for play, then this statement is also not true, because play happens in the passionate or in childhood. If you say that 'they have eternal pleasure in playing', then it will have to be assumed that there was also dissatisfaction before, because of the pleasure of playing. If they have created the world out of compassion, then the whole world should be happy, no one should be unhappy. 'Happiness and sorrow are subject to karma' they say, then karma is the cause and believing this destroys their independence. In the world, there is someone unhappy, someone happy, someone king, someone pauper, someone healthy-sick, someone connected-separated, someone rich-poor, etc. The diversity of feelings is due to karma, then the need for God, etc. does not seem to be there. Now someone may say that 'they created the world without purpose, then that statement is also incorrect. Even a child does not act without purpose.' From this it is proved that this world has not been created by anyone, nor has it been held by anyone. Many Puranas say 'Sheshnag, Kurma, Varaha, etc. have held this world; then it should be asked from them who has held Sheshnag, etc.? The answer is that the sky has. Then who has held the sky? It is self-established.' On getting such an answer, they say that 'the world is also stable in the sky without a base in the same way.' Thus it is proved that this world has not been created by anyone, it is self-existent; it has not been held by anyone. They doubt that 'where will the world stay without a base? They answer - in the sky.' But this world remains established in the sky in the form of the existing sky.

The meaning of the inner verses in this regard is being told - they doubt that 'why is the contemplation of the world called feeling?' They answer that 'it results in detachment; listen; if happiness causes fainting in the mind again and again in any feeling, then this feeling of the world can remove it completely.' We have said in 'Dhyan Shatak' that 'earth, island, sea, etc. are the subject of Dharma Dhyan.' Without this, the seeker cannot contemplate the feeling of the world. According to Shri Jineshwara's statement, after the unshakeable certainty of the substances in the form of the world, the beings should have faith in the transcendental path of liberation. Thus the feeling of the world. ||106||

Now the feeling of enlightenment is being told from three verses. 433. From the form of desireless flow, it arises for the virtuous. From the state of being stationary, it becomes a Tris, or it becomes a Tiryanch. ||107|| Meaning: From the virtue in the form of desireless flow, the being gets the Tris state from the stationary state or it gets the Tiryanch state. ||107|| Explanation: A stone flowing in the river flow of a mountain becomes round on its own by hitting obstacles, in the same way, enduring unexpected sorrow without desire is desireless flow. That is, many karmas attached to the soul are destroyed. This is not the nature of virtue, but the soul becoming lighter from the burden of karma.

## Bodhi, a Rare Sentiment

**Verse 108-109 from the Fourth Light of Yoga Shastra**

**Verse 107:**  From the state of being a one-sensed stationary being, the soul transcends to the state of a three-sensed being, or becomes a five-sensed animal. ||107||

**Verse 108:**  Human birth, in an Aryan land, with a noble lineage, and the perfection of all five senses, along with a long lifespan, are attained due to the lightness of karma. ||108||

**Meaning:**  After the karma becomes extremely light due to the accumulation of good deeds, the soul attains human birth, in an Aryan land, with a noble lineage, and the perfection of all five senses, along with a long lifespan. ||108||

**Explanation:**  Due to the lightness of karma, the soul attains human birth, similar to how a nail finds its way into a crack in the ocean of self-created existence. After attaining human birth, the soul is born in an Aryan land like Magadha, excluding non-Aryan lands like Shaka and Yavana. Even after attaining an Aryan land, the soul is born in a noble lineage, excluding the lower castes like Antyaja. Even after attaining a noble lineage, the soul attains the perfection of all five senses and a long lifespan only when the negative karma has reduced, and the auspicious signs of merit have increased. Only then can all these be attained. A person with a short lifespan cannot perform the duties of this world or the next. Shri Vitrag Bhagwan, while addressing Gautam, has emphasized the importance of a long lifespan along with other qualities. ||108||

**Verse 109:**  Even after attaining faith, listening to the teachings of the Guru, and hearing the scriptures, the attainment of the true knowledge, the jewel of Bodhi, is extremely rare. ||109||

**Meaning:**  Due to the lightness of karma and the rise of merit, the soul attains faith, the desire for Dharma, the Guru, and the opportunity to listen to their teachings. However, even after all this, the attainment of true knowledge, the unwavering devotion to God, Guru, and Dharma, the jewel of Bodhi (the jewel of right faith), is extremely difficult. ||109||

**Explanation:**  The transition from a stationary being to a three-sensed being is extremely rare, and from there, the attainment of the jewel of Bodhi is even rarer. The word "su" before "durlabham" emphasizes the extreme rarity of the jewel of Bodhi. Even those with wrong views, after countless births, reach the stage of listening to the scriptures, but they cannot attain the jewel of Bodhi. The seed of the tree of liberation is right faith. The inner meaning of the verses in this context is that attaining a kingdom or becoming a Chakravarti is not rare in this Jain Dharma, but the attainment of the jewel of Bodhi is extremely rare. All beings have experienced all the states of the world countless times before, but they have never attained the jewel of Bodhi, because their cycle of birth and death continues. After countless cycles of the transformation of matter, when half of the cycle of transformation of matter remains, the karma of all beings in the world reaches its peak, and then a being attains the jewel of Bodhi by breaking the knots. Many beings come close to breaking the knots by following their natural tendencies, but they return without attaining the jewel of Bodhi. Many beings attain the jewel of Bodhi but fall back and continue to wander in the cycle of birth and death. Listening to the scriptures of the wicked, associating with those with wrong views, indulging in bad habits, and negligence destroy the jewel of Bodhi. Although the attainment of conduct is considered rare, it is successful only when the jewel of Bodhi is attained. Without it, the attainment of the jewel of conduct is useless. Even an unliberated being can attain conduct and reach the Graiveyak Devaloka, but without the jewel of Bodhi, they cannot attain the bliss of liberation. A Chakravarti who does not attain the jewel of Bodhi is like a pauper, and a pauper who attains the jewel of Bodhi is greater than a Chakravarti. A being who attains right faith never becomes attached to the world. Being free from attachment, they worship liberation without any obstacles. The one who has attained this state of liberation before, the one who will attain it in the future, and the one who is attaining it now, all are the effects of the jewel of Bodhi, which is unparalleled in its influence and glory. Therefore, worship this jewel of Bodhi, praise it, listen to it, what is the use of anything else? Thus, the sentiment of Bodhi is complete. ||109||

## Equality as the Essence

**Chapter Four of Yoga Shastra, Verses 110-114**

This section concludes the discussion on the causes of non-attachment (nirmama) and connects it to the concept of equality (samata).

**Verse 110:**

**Meaning:** The mind that is constantly influenced by these twelve emotions (referring to the twelve emotions discussed previously) becomes free from attachment to all things and embraces equality.

**Verse 111:**

**Meaning:** For those who are detached from worldly objects and whose minds are filled with equality, the fire of passions (kṣayāgni) is extinguished, and the lamp of right conduct (bodhidīpa) shines brightly.

**Explanation:** This verse explains how conquering the senses leads to conquering passions, purifying the mind leads to conquering the senses, overcoming attachment and aversion leads to mental purity, and equality leads to overcoming attachment and aversion. It emphasizes that non-attachment, the essence of these emotions, leads to the attainment of equality.

**Verse 112:**

**Meaning:** After establishing equality, the yogi should take refuge in meditation. Without achieving equality, meditation becomes a mockery of the self. This is because true meditation cannot be achieved without equality.

**Explanation:** The yogi firmly establishes equality in their mind and then enters meditation. The importance of meditation will be discussed later. Although meditation and equality are essentially the same, a specific type of equality is called meditation. This type of equality is achieved through constant practice. If meditation is attempted without the equality achieved through practices like contemplation, the self is mocked. Therefore, a person who has not controlled their senses, purified their mind, overcome attachment and aversion, developed non-attachment, or practiced equality, and who engages in meditation based on tradition alone, will fall from the path of both worlds. Therefore, proper meditation avoids mocking the self and is beneficial for the soul.

**Verse 113:**

**Meaning:** Liberation (mokṣa) arises from the destruction of karma, which in turn arises from self-knowledge. There is no doubt about this. Self-knowledge is achieved through meditation. Renunciation of worldly pursuits and immersion in the true nature of the self, both are achieved through meditation. Therefore, meditation is considered beneficial for the soul.

**Explanation:** This verse addresses the question of whether equality or meditation is more important. It clarifies that both are equally important and inseparable.

**Verse 114:**

**Meaning and Explanation:** Meditation cannot exist without equality, and equality cannot be achieved without meditation. Therefore, both are mutually dependent and essential for achieving a state of freedom from suffering.

## Meditation Nature

**The essence of non-attachment comes from the fourth light of Yoga Shastra, verses 114 to 117. Therefore, these two are not independent of each other, as there are no mutual flaws. It is not that meditation cannot happen without equanimity, but it cannot be stable without it. Therefore, they are interdependent.**

**The explanation of equanimity has already been given. (114)**

**Now we explain the nature of meditation. (441)**

**The stability of the mind for a moment is meditation for the pseudo-yogis. That meditation is of two types, first Dharma meditation and second Shukla meditation. For the non-yogis, there is only suppression of yoga. (115)**

**Explanation:** There are two types of meditators - Sayogi and Ayogi. Sayogi meditators are also of two types, pseudo-yogis and Kevalis. The pseudo-yogis can only achieve stability of mind (concentration) in one object for a maximum of an antarmuhurta (48 minutes). That meditation is of two types for the pseudo-yogis - Dharma meditation and Shukla meditation. Dharma meditation is associated with the ten Dharmas or is attainable through the ten Dharmas. Shukla meditation is pure and bright, as it destroys all karmic impurities. Another meaning of Shukla is "Shugam duhkham klamayati - nashati iti shuklam". That is, Shukla meditation destroys the eight types of karmas that are the cause of suffering. The Sayogi Kevali has to suppress the yoga of mind, speech, and body. That is, he knows the suppression of yogas as meditation. The Sayogi Kevali has meditation during the suppression of yogas, there is no other meditation. The Sayogi Kevali, for a short period, practices with the yoga (activity) of mind, speech, and body. At the time of Nirvana, they suppress yoga. Here, there is a doubt that "what happens to the pseudo-yogis after they have achieved concentration in meditation for an antarmuhurta?" (115)**

**It is said that (442)**

**After the muhurta, there will be contemplation, or there will be another meditation with a different object. But it cannot remain stable in one object for more than a muhurta, because that is its nature. In this way, it takes the object of another meaning, and then takes the object of a third and meditates. Then it takes the fourth, and in this way, a long tradition of meditation continues. After the muhurta, the first meditation is summarized, and then it takes the object of another meaning. In this way, one should cultivate the feeling to increase meditation. (116)**

**The same thing is said (443)**

**One should engage in Maitri, Pramoda, Karuna, and Madhyastha bhavana. This is the elixir for Dharma meditation. (117)**

**Explanation:** Maitri is the feeling of affection from both sides. Therefore, having affection for all beings in the world is Maitri bhavana. Feeling joy towards those who are more virtuous than oneself, having a cheerful face when seeing them, and expressing devotion (affection) in one's heart towards them is Pramoda bhavana. Karuna bhavana or compassion is the feeling of compassion towards the poor, the suffering, the orphans, the disabled, and the helpless beings. Madhyastha bhavana is to remain in the middle of attachment and aversion. That is, Madhyastha or indifference is the feeling free from attachment and aversion. Why should these four bhavanas be connected with different souls? In response to this, it is said that if Dharma meditation breaks, then to connect it, just as an elixir is beneficial for a weak body in old age, similarly, Maitri etc. bhavanas are the nourishing elixir for Dharma meditation. (117)**

Maitri-adi Bhavana Svarupa

Yogashastra Chaturtha Prakasha, Shloka 118-120:

Maitri and the other four bhavanas (compassion, joy, and equanimity) also strengthen the broken dharma-dhyana (contemplation of the true nature of the self).

118. Maitri-bhavana: The thought that no being in the world should commit any sin, and that no being should be afflicted with sorrow; that all beings should be liberated from suffering and attain happiness - this is called maitri (friendliness).

119. Pramoda-bhavana: The affection and praise towards the virtues of those ascetics who have abandoned all flaws and contemplate the true nature of reality - this is called pramoda (joy).

120. Karuna-bhavana: The intention to alleviate the suffering of the distressed, the afflicted, the fearful, and those begging for their lives - this is called karuna (compassion).

Where and who should meditate? What should the posture be?

From the fourth light of Yoga Shastra, verses 121 to 123: How can those souls who are attached to the world and whose minds are not satisfied with the subjects experienced in countless births, be satisfied with the nectar of peace and attain the state of being free from attachment? How can those who are afraid of various fears, such as children, old people, etc., be made completely free from fear? And how can the nectar of the words of the great Lord Jinendra, who is free from all fear, be sprinkled on those beings who are facing death and are experiencing the pain of separation from their wealth, friends, wife, children, etc., and who are experiencing the pain of death? And how can they be made to attain a state of fearlessness from birth, old age, death, etc.? To do such a mind that counteracts suffering, to do direct counteraction, is not so; because the power to counteraction is not in every person; therefore, the awakening of such a counteraction mind is called compassion. If there is compassion for the impossible counteraction, then "After freeing all beings from the world, I will go to liberation"; saying this is not real compassion, but only a play of words. It is impossible for all worldly beings to do so. And it is also impossible to achieve liberation for oneself. One is the destruction of one's own world and then the liberation of all worldly beings is impossible. Therefore, this is to deceive the innocent. This is the compassion of the bound. Therefore, to give advice to do the above compassion, to give food, water, shelter, clothing, medicine, etc., according to the time and place, and to do good to the suffering is also compassion. ||120||

Now the nature of the intermediate feeling is told ||447||.  Cruel deeds without hesitation, gods, gurus, and those who criticize, those who are self-praising, indifference towards them is called intermediate feeling. ||121|| Meaning: Indifference towards beings who do cruel deeds without hesitation, who criticize gods and gurus, and who are self-praising is called intermediate feeling. ||121|| Explanation: Those who eat inedible food, those who drink alcohol, etc., those who engage in sexual intercourse with another's wife, etc., those who commit cruel deeds such as killing a sage, killing a child, killing a woman, killing a fetus, etc., and those who are not afraid of sin are worthy of indifference. Many people, after committing sin many times, have attained remorse and emotion; they are not worthy of indifference. Therefore, it is said that those who follow the rituals according to the words of the great Tirthankaras who have thirty-four perfections, and those who give advice, and who criticize the guru Maharaj due to attachment, hatred, or ignorance, or due to being misled by someone else; even if they have such faults, if they have attained the state of detachment and see their faults; they are not worthy of indifference. Therefore, it is said that those who are faulty, who praise their own soul - who consider their own soul to be good, and just as the mudga-shaila stone cannot be melted even by the pushkaravarta cloud, so those who commit cruel deeds, who criticize gods and gurus, and who praise themselves are impossible to bring to the right path by giving advice, therefore, indifference towards them is called intermediate feeling. ||121||

The same is discussed which was said that four feelings help in religious meditation. ||448|| The great wise yogi, by meditating on his own soul with the four feelings, reconnects the broken chain of pure meditation. ||122|| Meaning: The great wise yogi, by meditating on his own soul with the four feelings, reconnects the broken chain of pure meditation. ||122|| The type of place needed for meditation is told. ||449|| The yogi who has mastered the postures should go to the birthplace, initiation, liberation, or nirvana land of the Tirthankaras for the perfection of meditation. If it is not possible to go there, then he should take refuge in a secluded place. ||123|| Meaning: One should meditate in the birthplace, initiation, perfect knowledge, and nirvana land of the great Tirthankara. ||123|| Explanation: One should meditate in the birthplace, initiation, perfect knowledge, and nirvana land of the great Tirthankara.

## Various Asanas and Their Characteristics

**Yoga Shastra, Fourth Light, Verses 123-128**

In the absence of a suitable place, one should choose a place like a cave in a mountain, or a place suitable for meditation, free from women, animals, and eunuchs, for peace of mind. It is also said, "Sadhus should always take refuge in a secluded place, free from the company of young women, eunuchs, cunning people, etc., and especially during meditation, such a place should be chosen." 

For those who have stabilized their yoga and whose mind is steady in meditation, there is no difference between a village inhabited by ascetics or a desolate forest. Therefore, the meditator should meditate in a place where there is samadhi in the mind, concentration of the yoga of mind, speech, and body, and which is free from the disturbance of ghosts and beings.

The word "place" here also refers to time by implication. It is said that the time when the highest yoga-samadhi is attained is the best time for meditation. There is no fixed time of day or night for the meditator. 

The conclusion is that for the attainment of meditation, the yogi who practices specific asanas should take refuge in a secluded, peaceful, and solitary place. What kind of yogi is he? His characteristics will be described later. || 123 ||

**Now the instructions for the asanas are given:**

|| 450. Paryanka - Vira - Vajrabja - Bhadra - Dandasanani cha. Utkathika - Godohika - Kayotsargastathaasanam || 124 ||

**Meaning:** 1. Paryankasana, 2. Virasana, 3. Vajrasana, 4. Padmasana, 5. Bhadrasana, 6. Dandasana, 7. Utkatikasana, 8. Godohikasana, 9. Kayotsargasana, etc. are the names of the asanas. || 124 ||

**Now the nature of each asana is described in order:**

|| 451. Syajjanghayordhobhaage, padopari krte sati. Paryanko nabhigottaan - dakshinoत्तर - paanikaha || 125 ||

**Meaning:** When the lower part of both thighs is placed on the feet, and the right and left hands are placed above the navel, facing south and north respectively, it is called 'Paryankasana'. || 125 ||

**Meaning:** 
The eternal Jina-images and Sri Mahavira Bhagwan were in this Paryankasana at the time of their Nirvana. Patanjali has described the state of falling asleep with the arms stretched out as Paryankasana. || 125 ||

**Now the nature of Virasana is described:**

|| 452. Vamo'hrirdakshinoorudva - vamorupari dakshinaha. Kriyate yatra tadvirochitam virasanam smritam || 126 ||

**Meaning:** The asana in which the left foot is placed on the right thigh and the right foot on the left thigh is called Virasana, the asana suitable for heroes. || 126 ||

This asana is suitable for Tirthankaras and other heroic men, not for cowards. Some people also call Virasana Padmasana, describing it as a similar posture with both hands placed forward. Placing one foot on one thigh is called Ardhapadmasana. || 126 ||

**Now the characteristics of Vajrasana are described:**

**Meaning:** 
|| 453. Prushte vajraakritibhute dorbhyam virasane sati. Grihniyat padayoryatraangusthau vajrasanam tu tat || 127 ||

After performing the previously mentioned Virasana, when both hands are placed behind, forming a diamond shape, and the thumbs of both feet are grasped with both hands, the posture that is formed is called Vajrasana. || 127 ||

Many Acharyas also call it Vaitalasana. According to another opinion, the characteristics of Virasana are described:

|| 454. Simhasanaadhirudhasyasanaapanayena sati. Tathaivaavasthitiryataamanye virasanam viduh || 128 ||

**Meaning:** 
If a man is sitting on a throne with his feet on the ground, and the throne is removed from behind, the posture that is formed is called 'Virasana'. The Siddhantakars have described this asana in the context of Kayakleshatapa. || 128 ||

1. Those who talk about meditation collectively should think about this. How can meditation happen in a group?

## Description of Various Asanas

**Chapter 4, Light of Yoga, Verses 129-133**

Patanjali describes **Viraasana** as standing on one leg with the other leg bent and the body upright. Now, the characteristics of **Padmaasana** are described. 455.

**Verse 129:**
* **Meaning:** Experts in Asanas have named the posture where one thigh is placed on top of the other thigh in the middle as **Padmaasana**.

Now, **Bhadraasana** is described. 456.

**Verse 130:**
* **Meaning:** Bringing the soles of both feet together in the region of the testicles (scrotum) and placing the fingers of both hands interlocked on top of them is called **Bhadraasana**.

Patanjali describes the characteristics of **Bhadraasana** as follows: bringing the soles of the feet together near the testicles and placing the fingers of both hands interlocked on top of them.

Now, **Dandaasana** is described. 457.

**Verse 131:**
* **Meaning:** Sitting with the toes together, the ankles together, the thighs touching the ground, and the legs extended is called **Dandaasana**.

Patanjali describes it as follows: sitting on the ground with the toes together, the ankles together, the thighs touching the ground, and the legs extended. One should practice this.

Now, **Utkatakaasana** and **Godohikaasana** are described. 458.

**Verse 132:**
* **Meaning:** When both buttocks meet with the heels touching the ground, it is **Utkatakaasana**. This is the posture in which Lord Mahavira attained Kevala Jnana. It is said that on the tenth day of the bright fortnight of Vaisakha, in the third watch of the day, during the sixth tapasya, under a Sal tree, on the bank of the river Rijuvalika, outside the Jumbhika, the Veeraprabhu was in **Utkatakaasana** when he attained Kevala Jnana. When the ground is left behind by both heels from this posture, and the posture used while milking a cow, it is called **Godohikaasana**.

The Muni who is like a statue (Pratima Kalpi Muni) adopts this posture. Now, **Kayotsargaasana** is described. 459.

**Verse 133:**
* **Meaning:** Remaining still with both arms hanging down, standing or sitting (and lying down in a state of physical weakness), abandoning attachment to the body, is **Kayotsargaasana**.

**Explanation:** Remaining still with both arms hanging down, standing, sitting, or lying down, abandoning attachment to the body, is **Kayotsargaasana**. This is the posture of Jina Kalpi and Chhadmastha Tirthankaras. They practice **Kayotsarga** while standing. The Sthavira Kalpi practices **Kayotsarga** while standing, sitting, and, by implication, lying down, as long as they can maintain their Samadhi. Thus, abandoning the body with posture, meditation, and silence is called **Kayotsarga**.

The Asanas described here are just a glimpse. There are many other Asanas. They are as follows: remaining in a posture like the shape of a mango tree is **Amra Kubjaasana**. For example, Lord Mahavira adopted such a posture for one night, at which time the wicked Asura Sangamadeva...

##  Stability of Mind Remains Such an Asana

Yoga Shastra, Fourth Light, Verses 134-135 | Twenty prefixes were done on them. The Lord had borne them with equanimity. And lying on one side, upward-facing, downward-facing or sideways-facing is an asana. And lying down long like a staff, straightening the body and both thighs and legs | It is to remain stable by lengthening or widening. And Lagudshayitv is called that, in which the head and both ankles touch the ground, but the body remains suspended from the ground and Samasansthan - in which the part in front of the heel and the foot both | Bending and pressing against each other and Duryodhasana is called that, in which the head is placed on the ground and the feet are kept high, it is also called Kapalikaranasana. In the same way, if you do Padmasana with two thighs, it is called Dandapadmasana. In which the left foot is rotated and placed in the middle of the right thigh and the right foot is rotated and placed in the middle of the left foot, | It is called Swastikasana. What happens by the yoga of Yogapattak is Sopashrayasana. And Kaunch - Nishadana, Hans - Nishadana, | Garuda - Nishadana etc. asanas are from sitting in a position similar to the sitting position of those birds (those shaped). Thus, the method of asana is not systematic. This means that the methods of asana are of many kinds. || 133 || | 460. Jayate Yena Yeneha Vihiten Sthiran Manah. Tattadeva Vidhatavyam, Asanam Dhyana-Sadhanam || 134 ||
Meaning: - Whatever asana is used to make the mind steady, that asana should be used as a means of meditation. In this, one should only do such an asana, there is no such restriction. || 134 || Explanation: - Those who have calmed the sins, such karma-free sages have attained the supreme knowledge of the self in all kinds of countries, times and efforts. Therefore, the scriptures do not mention any rules for countries, times and efforts, i.e., asanas. Just as there is samadhi in yoga, one should try in the same way. | This statement of asanas, which has been made, is not meaningless. Because for the image-makers, there is a provision for doing asana according to the rules, and in the eighth image out of the twelve bhikshu-images, the rule of asana is also mentioned. It is like this - lying down with the face upwards or lying down by turning sideways or sitting or lying down straight. While sleeping, sitting or standing in this way, the gods, humans and animals should bear the severe afflictions with the mind and body without moving, with stillness, the ninth | image in this way - there are seven days and nights, in this, on the day of the parana of the fourth-part penance, one should do Ayambil and stay outside the village etc., and do everything else like the eighth, especially in this, there is so much that in this image, Utkat, i.e., only the thigh remains suspended in the middle on the basis of the head and ankles, or Lagud, i.e., like a crooked stick, only the back is the basis, the head and feet do not touch the ground in this way, or lying down with long legs like a staff | etc. to bear the afflictions. The tenth image is like this - the third, i.e., the tenth image is also the same as both of them, only in it there is Goduhasana (like when a cow is milked, both feet are placed on the ground and sit, in the same way) or | from Virasana, i.e., sitting on a throne, the feet are placed on the ground and later the throne is removed, the shape that is formed at that time, from that asana or sitting with the body curved like a mango tree. In any of these asanas, this | image can be adopted. || 134.
Asanas can be means of meditation, this is now explained by two verses.
| 461. Sukhasanasamaseenah, Sushlistaadharapallavah. Nasagranyastadrigdvando, Dantairdantanasansprusan || 135 ||
| | 462. Prasannavadanah Poorvaabhimukho Va'pyudanmukhah. Apramattaha Susansthano, Dhyata Dhyanodyato Bhavet || 136 || Meaning: - Remain seated in Sukhasana, both his lips should be joined, both eyes should be fixed on the tip of the nose, the teeth should not touch the teeth, the face should be pleasant, the face should be towards the east or north, without negligence

Meditation-worthy Asanas, their Method and Utility

From the fourth light of Yoga Shastra, verses 135 and 136, the meditator should strive to meditate with the spine straight. ||135-136|| Explanation: The meditator should sit in such a Sukhasana (comfortable posture) that Samadhi (meditation) is not disturbed even after sitting for a long time; both lips should be kept together, both eyes should be fixed on the tip of the nose; the teeth should be kept in such a way that the lower teeth do not touch the upper teeth, free from Rajoguna (passion) and Tamoguna (inertia), keep the face cheerful without blinking. Sit facing east or north, or in front of the image of the Lord, without being distracted. By saying 'Aparamatta' (undistracted), the main authority of meditation is being pointed out here. It is also said that - 'Aparamatta' and 'Samyata' (controlled) have Dharma-Dhyana (meditation on Dharma). The meditator should strive to meditate with the body straight or as steady as the spine. Thus, the three jewels of knowledge, vision, and conduct, which are the means of achieving meditation for the virtuous and the lay devotees, have been stated. The other aspects of meditation, such as its divisions, are explained in the eighth light. ||135-136|| || Thus, the fourth light of the Pattabaddha (bound) Upanishad named Adhyatmo Upanishad, composed by Acharya Shri Hemchandracharya Suri Shwar, with its own explanation, is complete, due to the curiosity of the king, Paramartha Shri Kumarapal.

## 5. The Fifth Light

**The Nature of Pranayama** -  Salutations to the omniscient Supreme Soul, Lord Jinendra.

Patanjali and other yoga masters have considered Yama, Niyama, Asana, Pranayama, Pratyahara, Dharana, Dhyana, and Samadhi as the eight limbs of yoga, which are the limbs of liberation. However, Jain thinkers have not accepted Pranayama as a true means of liberation, as it leads to non-meditation without practice. It is said, "Even one who is attached cannot stop breathing, then how can one who is striving for something else stop breathing?" (Without the practice of Hatha Yoga, one cannot stop breathing). Otherwise, immediate death is possible. Even subtle breathing should be known with effort according to the scriptures. Nevertheless, Pranayama is useful for the health of the body and for the knowledge of time. Therefore, it is described here.

**463.**  *Pranayamastatah kaischit, aashrito dhyanasiddhaye | Shakya netartha karthum, manah-pavan-nirjayah ||1||*

**Meaning:** After perfecting the posture, Patanjali and other yoga masters have taken recourse to Pranayama for the perfection of meditation. The air that circulates inside the mouth and nose is called 'Pran', and the control of its circulation is 'Pranayama'. Without Pranayama, the mind and the wind cannot be conquered.

**Here, the question arises, "Pranayama can conquer the wind, but how can it conquer the mind?" The answer is:**

**464.** *Mano yatra marut tatra, marud yatra manastatah | Astatulya-kriyavaite, samvitau ksheeraneeravat ||2||*

**Meaning:** Where the mind is, there is the wind, and where the wind is, there is the mind. Therefore, the mind and the wind, with their similar actions, are intertwined like milk and water.

**The similar action of both is explained:**

**465.** *Ekasya nashe anyasya syannaasho vruttau cha vartanam | Dhvastayorindriyamati-dhvamsanmokshascha jayate ||3||*

**Meaning:** If one of these two, the mind or the wind, is destroyed, the other is also destroyed, and if one is active, the other is also active. When both are destroyed, the activity of the senses and intellect is destroyed, and from the destruction of the senses and intellect, liberation arises.

**Now, the characteristics of Pranayama and its divisions are explained:**

**466.** *Pranayamao gati-chhedah, shwasaprashwasayormatah | Rechakah purakaschaiva, kumbhakascheti sa tridha ||4||*

**Meaning:** Inhaling the external air is called 'shwas'. Exhaling the air that remains in the abdomen is called 'nishwas' or 'prashwas', and stopping the movement of both is called 'Pranayama'. It is of three types: Rechaka, Puraka, and Kumbhaka.

**According to other masters, there are seven divisions of Pranayama, which are explained:**

**467.** *Pratyaharastatha shanta, uttarashchadhara tatha | Ebhirbhedhaischaturbhistu, saptadha kirtyate parai ||5||*

**Meaning:** Along with the aforementioned three, there are four more divisions: Pratyahara, Shanta, Uttara, and Adhara. Combining these four with the previous three, Pranayama becomes seven types, according to other masters.

**Now, the characteristics of each are explained:**

**468.** *Yat kosthadatyanena, nasabrahma-purananai | Bahih prakshepanam vaioh, sa rechak iti smruta ||6||*

## The Nature of Pranayama and Other Techniques

**Yoga Shastra, Fifth Light, Verses 6-13, Meaning:**

**Verse 6:** Exhaling air from the abdomen through the nostrils, the Brahmarandhra (the opening at the top of the head), and the mouth with great effort is called Rechaka Pranayama.

**Verse 7:** Drawing in external air and filling the abdomen up to the Apana (anus) is called Puraka Pranayama. Holding it steady like a Kumbha (pot) in the Nabhi Kamal (navel lotus) is called Kumbhaka Pranayama.

**Verse 8:** Moving the air from the Nabhi (navel) and other locations to the Hridaya (heart) and other locations, i.e., drawing the air from one location to another is called Pratyahara. Holding the air with the Taloo (palate), Nasika (nose), and Mukha (mouth) is called Shanta Pranayama. The difference between Shanta and Kumbhaka is that in Kumbhaka, the air is held in the Nabhi Kamal, while in Shanta Pranayama, there is no such rule, and the air is held at the exit points like the Nasika, etc.

**Verse 9:** Drinking in external air and drawing it upwards to the Hridaya (heart) and other locations is called Uttara Pranayama. Conversely, drawing the air downwards from above is called Adhara Pranayama.

**Explanation:** There is a doubt here: How can Rechaka, etc., be Pranayama? Because Pranayama involves stopping the flow of inhalation and exhalation. The answer is that in Rechaka, the air in the abdomen is drawn up and held at the nostrils, not allowing it to enter. From this perspective, it is called Pranayama because it is a form of stopping the flow of inhalation and exhalation. Similarly, in Puraka, external air is slowly inhaled and held in the abdomen. Here too, there is no stopping or taking of breath, i.e., it is a form of Pranayama that stops the flow. The same applies to Kumbhaka, etc.

**Verse 10:** Rechaka Pranayama destroys diseases of the abdomen and Kapha (phlegm). Puraka Pranayama strengthens the body and destroys all diseases.

**Verse 11:** Kumbhaka Pranayama immediately causes the Hridaya Padma (heart lotus) to bloom and breaks the internal glands, increases strength, and stabilizes the air.

**Verse 12:** Pratyahara Pranayama generates strength and radiance in the body. Shanta Pranayama pacifies the three Doshas (Vata, Pitta, Kapha) or Sannipat (fever). The practice of Uttara and Adhara Pranayama stabilizes Kumbhaka.

**Verse 13:** Pran, Apana, Samana, Udana, and Vyan are the five types of Pavan Vayu (air). Knowing the location, color, action, meaning, and seed of each Pavan, the Yogi conquers them through Pranayama.

**Explanation:** 1. The process of inhalation and exhalation is Pran Vayu. 2. Apana Vayu is responsible for expelling waste, urine, and the fetus. 3. Samana Vayu is responsible for digesting food and water and distributing the resulting Rasa (nutrients) to different parts of the body. 4. Udana Vayu carries Rasa and other substances upwards. 5. Vyan Vayu spreads throughout the body.

## The Nature of Pranayama

The fifth chapter of Yoga Shastra, verses 14 to 20, describe the location, color, action, meaning, and seed of the five vital airs. By knowing these, yogis conquer them through practices like Rechaka (exhalation) and other Pranayamas. ||13||

**Location, Color, and Conquering Pranavaayu**

||476|| Pranavaayu resides in the tip of the nose, the heart, the navel, and extends to the big toe. Its color is green. It should be conquered through the practice of Gamagama (exhalation and inhalation) and Dharana (concentration). ||14||

**Gamagama and Dharana**

||477|| Gamagama is achieved by repeatedly filling and emptying the air in the nasal cavity and other locations. Dharana is achieved by holding the breath (Kumbhaka). ||15||

**Location, Color, and Conquering Apana Vaayu**

||478|| Apana Vaayu is black in color. It resides in the nape of the neck, the back, the anus, and the heel. It should be conquered by repeatedly exhaling and inhaling in these locations. ||16||

**Location, Color, and Conquering Samana Vaayu**

||479|| Samana Vaayu is white in color. It resides in the heart, the navel, and all the joints. It should be conquered by repeatedly exhaling, inhaling, and holding the breath in its respective locations. ||17||

**Location, Color, and Conquering Udana Vaayu**

||480|| Udana Vaayu is red in color. It resides in the heart, throat, palate, the middle of the eyebrows, and the head. It should be controlled through the practice of movement and stillness. ||18||

**Movement and Stillness**

||481|| Udana Vaayu should be drawn from the outside through the nose and placed in the heart and other locations. If it moves to another location, it should be forcefully restrained and held there repeatedly. This means holding the breath (Kumbhaka) for a while and then exhaling. In other words, the air should be slowly exhaled through one nostril, then inhaled through the same nostril and held. This will subdue the air. ||19||

**Location, Color, and Conquering Vyanavaayu**

||482|| Vyanavaayu is multi-colored like a rainbow. It resides in all parts of the skin. It should be conquered through the practice of Kumbhaka, contraction, and expansion (inhalation and exhalation). ||20||

**Seed Mantras for the Five Vayus**

## The Nature of Pranayama and Others

**Yoga Shastra, Seventh Light, Verses 21-31**

**483.** In the five vital airs, Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana, and Vyana, the seeds 'M', 'M', 'V', 'R', and 'L' respectively should be meditated upon during the stages of Puraka, Kumbhaka, and Rechaka Pranayama. **21.**

**Meaning:** While conquering Prana Vayu, meditate on the seed 'M', while conquering Apana Vayu, meditate on the seed 'M', while conquering Samana, meditate on the seed 'V', while conquering Udana, meditate on the seed 'R', and while conquering Vyana, meditate on the seed 'L'. In other words, visualize the form of these letters and chant them during Puraka, Kumbhaka, and Rechaka. **21.**

Now, the benefits of conquering Prana and other vital airs are explained in three verses.

**484.** By conquering Prana Vayu, the digestive fire becomes strong, breathing becomes continuous, there is no asthma, and the other vital airs also come under control, as all vital airs depend on Prana Vayu. This makes the body light and agile. **22.**

**485.** By conquering Samana and Apana Vayu, wounds and fractures heal quickly, the digestive fire becomes strong, excretions become minimal, and diseases are destroyed. **23.**

**486.** By conquering Udana Vayu, the yogi can achieve Uttkranti (i.e., leaving the body at the time of death through the ten doors). He can walk on water and mud without being touched, and he can walk on thorns or fire without any harm, like walking on a straight path. By conquering Vyana Vayu, the body is not affected by cold or heat, the body's radiance increases, and one attains perfect health. **24.**

Thus, the benefits of conquering each vital air are explained separately. Now, the collective benefit of conquering all vital airs is explained.

**487.** Wherever a disease afflicts a living being, one should always hold the Prana and other vital airs in that place to alleviate the suffering. This destroys the disease. **25.**

Concluding the above points, a connection is made with what follows.

**488.** Having practiced conquering the Prana and other vital airs repeatedly, one should always practice Dharana and other techniques for mental stability. **26.**

Now, the method of Dharana and other techniques is explained in five verses.

**489.** Sitting in the previously mentioned posture, slowly exhale the air. Then, fill the body with air from the toes to the thumb, through the left channel. **27.**

**490.** First, fix the mind on the thumb, then on the sole of the foot, then on the ankle, then on the shin, then on the knee, then on the buttocks. **28.**

**491.** Then, on the genitals, the navel, the chest, the throat, the tongue, the palate, the tip of the nose, the eyes, the eyebrows, the forehead, and the head. **29.**

**492.** Thus, holding the vital airs along with the mind, move from one point to another, until you reach the Brahma Pura (the crown of the head). **30.**

**493.** Then, gradually bring the mind back to the thumb, passing through the lotus of the navel, and then exhale the air. **31.**

**Meaning:** Sitting in any of the postures mentioned at the end of the Fourth Light, slowly exhale the air.

##  Dharana and its Fruits

**Yoga Shastra, Pancham Prakash, Shlokas 32 to 39**

**Translation:**

**Dharana**

Draw the mind inwards through the left nostril and bring it to the big toe, restraining it there. Then, gradually move the mind along with the breath to the sole of the foot, the heel, the ankle, the shin, the knee, the thigh, the anus, the penis, the navel, the stomach, the heart, the throat, the tongue, the palate, the tip of the nose, the brow, the skull, and finally to the Brahmarandhra. After that, return in the same order, finally bringing the breath to the big toe along with the mind, then to the navel, and then exhale. || 27-31 ||

Now, four shlokas describe the fruits of Dharana.

**Fruits of Dharana:**

* **Shloka 32:** Holding the breath in the big toe, heel, ankle, shin, knee, thigh, anus, and penis, respectively, leads to swiftness and strength.
* **Shloka 33:** Holding the breath in the navel removes fever, holding it in the stomach purifies the body, holding it in the heart increases knowledge, and holding it in the Kourma Nadi destroys disease and old age, maintaining youthful vigor even in old age.
* **Shloka 34:** Holding the breath in the throat eliminates hunger and thirst, holding it at the tip of the tongue grants knowledge of all tastes, holding it at the tip of the nose grants knowledge of smell, and holding it in the eyes grants knowledge of form.
* **Shloka 35:** Holding the breath in the skull and brain destroys brain-related diseases, pacifies anger, and holding it in the Brahmarandhra grants direct vision of the Siddhas. || 32-35 ||

**Concluding Dharana and Describing the Movement of Prana:**

* **Shloka 36:** Dharana is the ultimate cause of Siddhis. By practicing it in this way, one should strive to understand the movement of Prana without any doubt. || 36 ||

**General Siddhis:**

* **Shloka 37:** The outward movement of Prana from the navel is called "Char," bringing it to the center of the heart is called "Gati," and its dwelling in the Brahmarandhra should be understood as its "Sthana." || 37 ||

**Fruits of the Knowledge of Char, Gati, and Sthana:**

* **Shloka 38:** By practicing the knowledge of Char, Gati, and Sthana, one can understand time (death), lifespan, and the rise of auspicious and inauspicious fruits. || 38 ||

**Further Instructions:**

* **Shloka 39:** Then, gradually, the Yogi should draw the mind along with the breath and place it within the lotus of the heart, controlling it. || 39 ||

**Fruits of this Practice:**

## The Nature of the Mandalas

**Yoga Shastra, Panchama Prakash, Sloka 40-47, 502.**

* **Sloka 40:** _"Tato'vidya viliyante, vishayeccha vinishyati. Vikalpa vinivartante, jnanamantarvijrumbhate."_
* **Meaning:** By restraining the mind in the heart lotus, ignorance (avidya) is destroyed; the desire for sense objects is also destroyed, thoughts and doubts disappear, and knowledge grows within the soul.

**503.** By stabilizing the mind and breath in the heart, the knowledge of one's true nature is revealed.

* **Sloka 41:** _"Kva mandale gatirvaayoḥ sankramaḥ kva kva vishramah? Ka cha naditi janiyat, tatra chitte sthirikrte."_
* **Meaning:** When the mind is stabilized in the heart lotus, in which mandala does the breath move? In which element does it enter? Where does it rest? And which nadi is active at that time? This can be known.

**504.** Now, the Mandalas are described.

* **Sloka 42:** _"Mandalanicha chatvari, nasikavivare viduh. Bhaumavarunavaayavyaagneyaakhyani yathottaram."_
* **Meaning:** In the nostrils, there are four Mandalas: 1. Bhauma (Parthiva) Mandala, 2. Varuna Mandala, 3. Vayavya Mandala, and 4. Agneya Mandala.

**505.** The nature of the Parthiva Mandala is described.

* **Sloka 43:** _"Prithvibijasampoornam, vajralanchanasamyutam. Chaturasram taptasvarnaprabham syad bhaumamandalam."_
* **Meaning:** The Parthiva Mandala is filled with the seed of earth, marked with the symbol of a thunderbolt, square in shape, and the color of heated gold.

**506.** Now, the nature of the Varuna Mandala is described.

* **Sloka 44:** _"Syadardhachandra samsthanam, varunaaksharalanchhitam. Chandraabhamamaritasandram sandram varunamandalam."_
* **Meaning:** The Varuna Mandala is shaped like the half-moon of the eighth lunar day, marked with the symbol of the Varuna letter 'gha', moon-like, radiant, and filled with the flow of nectar.

**507.** Now, the nature of the Vayavya Mandala is described.

* **Sloka 45:** _"Snigdhaanjanghanachchhayam, suvruttam bindusankulam. Durlakshyam pavanaakrantam, chanchalam vayumandalam."_
* **Meaning:** The Vayavya Mandala is dark, like a mixture of collyrium and clouds, round, marked with the symbol of a dot, difficult to perceive, surrounded by wind, and marked with the seed of wind, the letter 'ya'.

**508.** Now, the nature of the Agneya Mandala is described.

* **Sloka 46:** _"Urdhvajvalanchitam bheem, trikonam swastikaanvitam. Sphulingapingam tadbijam, jneyamagneya mandalam."_
* **Meaning:** The Agneya Mandala is filled with flames rising upwards, terrifying, triangular, marked with the symbol of a swastika, the color of fire sparks, and marked with the seed of fire, the letter 'reph'.

**509.** Now, to enlighten the unbelievers, it is said:

* **Sloka 47:** _"Abhyasen swasanvedyam, syanmandalachatushtayam. Kramena sancharannatra, vayurjeyaschaturvidhah."_
* **Meaning:** By practicing, one can experience the four Mandalas. The breath, which moves through these four Mandalas, is also of four types. This will be described in order.

## Auspicious and Inauspicious Effects of Air

The fifth chapter of Yoga Shastra, verses 48 to 57, describe the effects of different types of air in detail.

**Verse 48:** The air named Purandar, belonging to the earth element, is yellow in color, slightly warm and slightly cool, and pure. It flows slowly, filling the nostrils and extending outwards for eight angulas (finger widths).

**Verse 49:** The air named Varuna, belonging to the water element, is white, cool, and flows rapidly downwards for twelve angulas.

**Verse 50:** The air named Pavana, belonging to the air element, is warm and cool, black in color, and flows diagonally for six angulas.

**Verse 51:** The air named Dahan, belonging to the fire element, is red like the rising sun, extremely hot, and flows upwards in a whirlwind for four angulas.

**Verse 52:** When Purandar air is flowing, one should perform actions like meditation. When Varuna air is flowing, one should perform auspicious actions. When Pavana air is flowing, one should perform actions related to impurities and fickleness. When Dahan air is flowing, one should perform actions like subjugation.

**Verse 53:** When Purandar air is flowing at the beginning or during the questioning of an action, it indicates the attainment of desired results like an umbrella, a fly whisk, an elephant, a horse, a woman, and a kingdom.

**Verse 54:** When Varuna air is flowing at the beginning or during the questioning of an action, it indicates the immediate attainment of a complete kingdom, sons, relatives, friends, and all essential things.

**Verse 55:** When Pavana air is flowing at the beginning or during the questioning of an action, it indicates that all actions like agriculture and service will be fruitless, leading to loss, fear of death, conflict, hatred, and fear.

**Verse 56:** When Dahan air is flowing at the beginning or during the questioning of an action, it indicates fear, sorrow, illness, suffering, a series of obstacles, and the destruction of wealth and grain.

**Verse 57:** All four types of air, Purandar, Varuna, Pavana, and Dahan, are auspicious when they enter the body through the left or right nostril, following the path of the moon or the sun, respectively. They are inauspicious when they exit the body.

This explains the auspicious and inauspicious effects of the four types of air based on their entry and exit from the body.

## The Auspicious and Inauspicious Effects of Air

**Yoga Shastra, Fifth Light, Verses 58 to 64**

**Verse 58:**

* **Meaning:** When air enters the body, it is called *Jiva* (life), and when it exits, it is called *Mrityu* (death). Therefore, wise ones say that the effect of entering air is auspicious, and the effect of exiting air is inauspicious. This means that if the *Purvak* (inhaling) air enters the nostrils and someone asks a question, that task will be successful. But if the *Rechak* (exhaling) air exits the body and someone asks a question, that task will not be successful.

**Verse 59:**

* **Meaning:** The *Purandar* and *Varun* air, entering through the left nostril (Moon), grants all success. But when these two exit through the right nostril (Sun), they bring destruction. And when these two enter and exit through the right nostril, they bring moderate results.

**Verse 60:**

* **Meaning:** The *Purandar* and *Varun* air, exiting through the right nostril, bring destruction. But when these two enter and exit through the left nostril, they bring moderate results.

**Verse 61:**

* **Meaning:** The left nostril is called *Ida*, and the Moon resides there. The right nostril is called *Pingala*, and the Sun resides there. The *Sushumna* nadi, located in the middle, is considered the path to liberation.

**Verse 62:**

* **Meaning:** The left nostril is considered to be filled with nectar, showering the entire body with it constantly. It is also considered to be a sign of fulfilling desires.

**Verse 63:**

* **Meaning:** The right nostril carries the signs of inauspiciousness and hinders tasks. The *Sushumna* nadi is the cause of the eight great powers (Animadi) and liberation.

**Verse 64:**

* **Meaning:** The left nostril is auspicious for starting auspicious tasks like journeys, donations, weddings, wearing new clothes and ornaments, entering villages, cities, and homes, meeting loved ones, peace rituals, nourishing activities, yoga practice, meeting royalty, healing, friendship, and sowing seeds. The right nostril is auspicious for activities like eating, conflict, sensual pleasures, war, mantra practice, initiation, service, business, medicine, dealing with ghosts and spirits, and other fierce activities.

**Explanation:**

The meaning is that focusing on the *Sushumna* nadi leads to quick concentration in meditation and a long-lasting practice. This helps in destroying karma quickly, making it the path to liberation. Additionally, the air flow in the *Sushumna* nadi is very slow, allowing the mind to easily become still. The stillness of mind and breath makes it easier to practice self-control. Holding *Dharana*, *Dhyana*, and *Samadhi* in one place is self-control, and this kind of self-control leads to powers. Therefore, the *Sushumna* nadi is considered the cause of liberation and powers.

**Conclusion:**

This passage explains the auspicious and inauspicious effects of air based on its direction of flow through the nostrils. It also highlights the importance of the *Sushumna* nadi in achieving liberation and powers.

## The Auspicious and Inauspicious Effects of Air

**Chapter 5, Light 5 of Yoga Shastra, Verses 65-73**

Now we discuss the unequal division of the left and right nadis. (527)

**Verse 65:**
* **Vama Shasthodaye Pakshe, Site Krishna Tu Dakshina | Trini Trini Dinani Indu-Surya Yorudayah Shubhah ||**
* **Meaning:** In the Shukla Paksha (bright fortnight), the rising of the left nadi at sunrise is considered auspicious, and in the Krishna Paksha (dark fortnight), the rising of the right nadi at sunrise is considered auspicious. The rising of both these nadis is considered auspicious for three days. (5)

Further clarification will be provided in this regard. Having stated the rule of rising, we now state the rule of setting. (528)

**Verse 66:**
* **Shashakenodayo Vayoh, Suryena Astam Shubhavaham | Udaye Ravin Tvasya, Shashina Astam Shivamatam ||**
* **Meaning:** The day on which the air rises in the Chandra Swar (lunar influence) at sunrise and sets in the Surya Swar (solar influence) is auspicious. If on that day it rises in the Surya Swar and sets in the Chandra Swar, it is also considered auspicious. (66)

We explain this point further through three verses. (529)

**Verse 67:**
* **Sitapaskhe Dinarambe, Yatnata Pratipaddi Ne | Vayorvikshet Sancharam, Prashastamitram Tatha ||**
* **Meaning:** On the Pratipada (first day) of the Shukla Paksha, one should carefully observe the movement of the air at the beginning of sunrise, whether it is auspicious or inauspicious.

**Verse 68:**
* **Udeti Pavana Purvam, Shashinyesha Tryaham Tatah | Sankramathi Tryaham Suryee, Shashinyeva Punastryaham ||**
* **Meaning:** The Chandra Nadi flows for the first three days (1, 2, 3) at sunrise. After that, the Surya Nadi flows for the next three days (4, 5, 6). Then, the Chandra Nadi flows again for the next three days (7, 8, 9), followed by the Surya Nadi for the next three days (10, 11, 12), and finally the Chandra Nadi flows for the last three days (13, 14, 15).

**Verse 69:**
* **Vahed Yavad Brihanpurvakramenena Marutah | Krishna Pakshe Punah Suryodayapurvam Ayam Kramah ||**
* **Meaning:** The air flows in this order for the entire Shukla Paksha. In the Krishna Paksha, the Surya Nadi flows for the first three days (1, 2, 3), followed by the Chandra Nadi for the next three days (4, 5, 6), and so on, in this order of three days each, until the Amavasya (new moon). This order of the air is not for the entire day, but only for the time of sunrise. After that, the Chandra Nadi and Surya Nadi change every two and a half hours.

If there is a change in this order, its result is inauspicious or indicative of suffering. (67-69)

If there is a disturbance in this order, its result is explained in two verses. (532)

**Verse 70:**
* **Trin Pakshananyathavetasya, Masashatkena Panchata | Pakshadvayam Vipariyase Abhisht-Bandhuvipad Bhavet ||**
* **Meaning:** If the air flows contrary to the aforementioned order of Chandra or Surya Nadi for three Pakshas, then death occurs within six months. If the contrary order persists for two Pakshas, then calamity befalls loved ones and relatives.

**Verse 71:**
* **Bhavet Tu Daruna, Vyadhirekpakasam Vipariyaye | Dvivyadya Harvipariyase, Kalahaadikamudvishet ||**
* **Meaning:** If the contrary air flows for one Paksha, then a severe disease arises. If the contrary air flows for two or three days, then strife and other inauspicious results arise. (70-71)

**Verse 72:**
* **Ekam Dve Trini Ahoratraanyarka Eva Marud Vahan | Varshetribhirvabhyamekenantayeindau Ruje Punah ||**
* **Meaning:** If the air flows only in the Surya Nadi for the entire day and night, then death occurs in three years. Similarly, if the air flows for two days and nights, then death occurs in two years, and if it flows for three days and nights, then death occurs in one year. If the Chandra Nadi flows for that many days, then disease arises. (72)

**Verse 73:**
* **Masamekam Ravaveva, Vahan Vayurvinirdishit | Ahoratravadhirmrityum Shashanke Tu Dhanakshayam ||**
* **Meaning:** If the air flows continuously in the Surya Nadi for one month, then death occurs within one day and night. If the Chandra Nadi flows for that long, then loss of wealth occurs. (73)

## Chapter 5, Verses 74-84 of Yoga Shastra:

**Verse 73:** If the wind continues to flow through the Chandra Nadi for a month, the person's wealth will be destroyed.

**Verse 74:** 
* **Meaning:** If the wind flows through all three Nadis (Ida, Pingala, and Sushumna) simultaneously, death will occur after two Praharas. If the wind flows through Ida and Pingala together, death will occur in ten days. If the wind flows only through Sushumna for a long time, death will occur quickly.

**Verse 75:**
* **Meaning:** If the wind continuously flows through the Chandra Nadi for ten days, it will cause anxiety and illness. If the wind alternates between the Surya and Chandra Nadis, flowing through one for half a Prahara and the other for half a Prahara, it will bring benefits, worship, and prestige.

**Verse 76:**
* **Meaning:** When the day and night are equal, with twelve hours each, it is called Vishuvat Kala. This occurs twice a year. If someone's eyes flicker during this Vishuvat Kala, they will surely die within a day and night. This flickering is also a sign of wind imbalance, so it does not contradict the current context.

**Verse 77:**
* **Meaning:** The transition of the wind from one Nadi to another is called "Sankranti." If five Sankrantis occur consecutively during the day, and on the sixth Sankranti the wind flows through the mouth, it indicates loss of friends, wealth, energy, and all other misfortunes, except death.

**Verse 78:**
* **Meaning:** If thirteen Sankrantis occur consecutively, and the wind flows through the left nostril, it indicates the onset of illness, anxiety, and other problems.

**Verse 79:**
* **Meaning:** If the wind flows through the same Nadi for five consecutive days starting from the first day of Margashirsha month, death will occur in the eighteenth year from that day.

**Verse 80:**
* **Meaning:** If the wind flows through the same Nadi for five consecutive days starting from the beginning of Sharad Ritu (Ashoj month), death will occur at the end of the fifteenth year from that day.

**Verse 81:**
* **Meaning:** If the wind flows through the same Nadi for five consecutive days starting from the beginning of Shravan month, it indicates death in the twelfth year.

**Verse 82:**
* **Meaning:** If the wind flows through the same Nadi for ten consecutive days starting from the first day of Jyeshtha month, death will surely occur at the end of the ninth year.

**Verse 83:**
* **Meaning:** If the wind flows through the same Nadi for five consecutive days starting from the first day of Chaitra month, death will surely occur at the end of the sixth year.

**Verse 84:**
* **Meaning:** If the wind flows through the same Nadi for five consecutive days starting from the beginning of Magha month, it indicates death at the end of the third year.

## Yogashastra, Fifth Light, Verses 85-92:

**If the wind blows continuously in one nadi for six years, death is certain.** If the wind blows in one nadi for five days starting from the first day of the month of Magh, it indicates death within three years. ||81-84||

**Knowledge of Death Through Wind**

||547|| If the wind blows for two, three, or four days in one nadi, then the lifespan should be reduced by that many divisions of the year. For example, if the wind blows in one nadi for five days at the beginning of the month of Margashirsha, death is predicted in eighteen years. If the wind blows for four days instead of five, then the lifespan should be reduced by one-fifth of eighteen years, which is three years, seven months, and six days. This results in a lifespan of fourteen years, four months, and twenty-four days. Similarly, if the wind blows for three or two days, the lifespan should be calculated accordingly. The same rule applies to the months of Sharad and others. ||85||

**Another Method for Determining Lifespan Through Wind**

||548|| Now, I will explain another method for determining lifespan. This method is based on the path of the Sun and is known as the "Paushnakal." ||86||

**The Nature of Paushnakal**

||549|| When the Moon is in the birth nakshatra and the Sun is in the seventh house from its own sign, and the Moon has traversed the same number of birth signs as the Sun has traversed the seventh house, then this period is called "Paushnakal." Death can be determined during this period. ||87||

**Determining Lifespan Through Wind in Paushnakal**

||550|| If the wind blows in the Surya nadi for half a day during Paushnakal, death will occur in the fourteenth year. If the wind blows for a full day, death will occur in the twelfth year. ||88||

||551|| Similarly, if the wind blows for one day and night, two days, or three days in the Surya nadi during Paushnakal, death will occur in the tenth year, eighth year, and sixth year respectively. ||89||

||552|| If the wind blows for four days, death will occur in the fourth year. If it blows for five days, death will occur in the third year, or after one thousand eighty days. ||90||

||553|| If the wind blows continuously for six, seven, eight, nine, or ten days in the Surya nadi, the lifespan will be reduced by one, two, three, four, or five twenty-fours from the total of 1080 days. ||91||

**Explanation of the Above**

||554|| If the wind blows for six days, the lifespan will be one thousand sixty-five days. ||92||

Knowledge of the Time of Death from Air

The fifth light of Yoga Shastra, verses 103 to 112, further explain this.565. If the wind flows continuously through one nostril for sixteen days, then out of 360 days, one twelve less, i.e., 360-12=348 days, he will live. ||103|| Meaning: If the wind flows continuously through one nostril for sixteen days, then out of 360 days, one twelve less, i.e., 360-12=348 days, he will live. ||103|| 566. If the wind flows through one nostril for seventeen days, then death will occur in 348 days minus two twelves, i.e., 348-24=324 days. ||104|| Meaning: If the wind flows through one nostril for seventeen days, then death will occur in 348 days minus two twelves, i.e., 348-24=324 days. ||104|| Thus 1567. If the wind flows for eighteen days, then death will occur in 324 days minus three twelves, i.e., 324-36=288 days. ||105|| Meaning: If the wind flows for eighteen days, then death will occur in 324 days minus three twelves, i.e., 324-36=288 days. ||105|| Thus 1568. If the wind flows for nineteen days, then death will occur in 288 days minus four twelves, i.e., 288-48=240 days. ||106|| Meaning: If the wind flows for nineteen days, then death will occur in 288 days minus four twelves, i.e., 288-48=240 days. ||106|| 1569. If the wind flows through one nostril for twenty days, then death will occur in 240 days minus five twelves, i.e., 240-60=180 days, without a doubt. ||107|| Meaning: If the wind flows through one nostril for twenty days, then death will occur in 240 days minus five twelves, i.e., 240-60=180 days, without a doubt. ||107|| ||570. From one, two, three, four, five, six days, the decrease should be in the order of one, two, three, four, and five sixes. From twenty-one to twenty-five days, these should be subtracted accordingly. ||108|| Meaning: If the wind flows through the Surya Nadi for twenty-one to twenty-five days, then from the aforementioned 180 days, one, two, three, four, and five sixes should be subtracted accordingly. ||108|| This is explained 1571.

If the wind flows for twenty-two days, then he will live for 174 days minus two sixes, i.e., 162 days. If the wind flows for twenty-three days, then death will occur in 162 days minus three sixes, i.e., 162-18=144 days, which is six days less than five months. ||110|| Meaning: If the wind flows for twenty-two days, then he will live for 174 days minus two sixes, i.e., 162 days. If the wind flows for twenty-three days, then death will occur in 162 days minus three sixes, i.e., 162-18=144 days, which is six days less than five months. ||110|| Thus 573.

## Yoga Shastra, Fifth Light, Verses 113-122: Description of External Time Signs

**Verse 113:** If the wind blows for twenty-seven days, death occurs in one month. If it blows for twenty-eight days, death occurs in fifteen days.

**Verse 114:** If the wind blows in one nadi for twenty-nine days, death occurs in ten days. If it blows for thirty days, death occurs on the fifth day.

**Verse 115:** If the wind blows for thirty-one days, death occurs in three days. If it blows for thirty-two days, death occurs in two days.

**Verse 116:** Thus, after concluding the four types of Surya Nadi, we describe the four types of Chandra Nadi. If the wind blows in the Surya Nadi for thirty-three days, death occurs in one day. If the wind blows in the Chandra Nadi, it does not result in death, but instead indicates illness, loss of friends, great fear, leaving one's homeland, loss of wealth and children, destruction of the kingdom, famine, etc.

**Verse 117:** By practicing and observing the wind within the body, dependent on the Surya and Chandra Nadi, one should know the determination of time.

**Verse 118:** Due to illness, the internal wind can become reversed. To determine the time accurately, we describe the external signs of time.

**Verse 119:** The signs of time are three-fold: through the eyes, ears, and head. These are observed in relation to the sun, and other external signs can be observed as desired.

**Verse 120:** In the left eye, one should know the presence of a sixteen-petaled lotus, blooming with the moon's light. In the right eye, one should know the presence of a twelve-petaled lotus, blooming with the sun's light.

**Verse 121:** Four petals of each lotus, resembling the glow of fireflies, should be visible in each eye when pressed with one's finger, as instructed by the Guru.

**Verse 122:** In the Chandra-related lotus, if the four lower petals are not visible, death occurs in six months. If the petals are lost in the eyebrow, forehead, and near the nose, death occurs in six months, three months, and one month respectively.

##  Knowledge of Time through Eyes, Ears, Head and Other Means

**From Yoga Shastra, Pancham Prakash, Verses 123-131**

**Verse 122:** If the petal near the eye is not visible, death occurs in three months; if the petal at the corner of the eye is not visible, death occurs in two months; and if the petal near the nose is not visible, death occurs in one month.

**Verse 123:** This is the same order for the lotus related to the sun. When the petals are not visible, death occurs in ten, five, three, and two days respectively.

**Verse 124:** If the petals of both lotuses are not visible without pressing the eye with a finger, death occurs in one hundred days.

**Verses 125-126:** Now, the knowledge of lifespan through the ears is explained in two verses. Contemplating the lotus with eight petals in the heart, if the sound of fire (agni-nirghosh) is not heard in both ears when pressed with the index fingers of both hands, death occurs in five years if it is not heard for five days, in four years if it is not heard for ten days, in three years if it is not heard for fifteen days, in two years if it is not heard for twenty days, and in one year if it is not heard for twenty-five days.

**Verse 127:** If the sound of fire is not heard in the ear even after pressing with a finger for six to sixteen days, then death occurs in five years, subtracting one, two, three, four, etc., sixteen twenty-fours. For example, if the sound is not heard for five days, death occurs in five years. After that, if the sound of fire is not heard for six days, then subtract twenty-four days from five years, i.e., death occurs in 1776 days (1800 days - 24 days). If it is not heard for seven days, then subtract two twenty-fours (48 days) from 1776 days, i.e., death occurs in 1728 days. If it is not heard on the eighth day, then subtract five twenty-fours (120 days) from the previous number, i.e., death occurs in 1440 days, which is four years. Similarly, the time of death should be determined by subtracting the above twenty-fours for eleven to sixteen days and twenty-one days.

**Verse 128:** Now, the determination of time of death through the head is explained. If the smoke line (dhumrarekha) spreading from the Brahma-randhra (the opening at the top of the head) is not visible for five days, then death occurs in three years.

**Verses 129-131:** The knowledge of time through other means is explained in six verses. On the first day of the bright fortnight (Shukla Paksha), one should purify oneself and imagine one's right hand as the bright fortnight for knowing the time cycle. The lower, middle, and upper joints of the little finger should be considered as the first, sixth, and eleventh tithis (lunar days) respectively. The remaining joints of the fingers should be considered as the remaining tithis. The fifth, tenth, and full moon (raka) should be considered as the joints of the thumb.

## Means of Knowing Time

**Yoga Shastra, Fifth Light, Verses 132-139**

Imagine the eleventh lunar day (Ekadashi). On the thumb, imagine the fifth, tenth, and full moon days in the lower, middle, and upper phalanges respectively. On the ring finger, imagine the second, third, and fourth lunar days in the three phalanges. On the middle finger, imagine the seventh, eighth, and ninth lunar days in the three phalanges. On the index finger, imagine the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth lunar days in the three phalanges. ||130-131|| ||594||

Imagine the dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) in the left hand, with the lunar days in the same way as in the right hand. Then, in a secluded place, the wise seeker should sit in the lotus posture (Padmasana), with a joyful mind and bright contemplation. He should join both hands in the shape of a lotus bud and contemplate a black point within the hands. ||132-133||

**Meaning:** On the first day of the dark fortnight, imagine the lunar days of the dark fortnight in the left hand, in the same way as in the right hand. Then, the wise seeker should go to a secluded place, sit in the lotus posture, and with a joyful mind and bright contemplation, join both hands in the shape of a lotus bud and contemplate a black point within the hands. ||132-133||

Then, when the lotus of the hands is opened, the black or white point of time that is seen within the finger corresponding to the lunar day, is considered to be the day of death. ||134||

**Meaning:** If one cannot see the Rohini constellation, the moon sign, the path of the sun (Mahapath), Arundhati star, and Dhruva star, then death will occur within a year. ||136||

In this regard, the commentary quotes the opinion of other teachers in two verses, as follows:

Those whose lifespan is waning cannot see Arundhati, Dhruva, the three steps of Vishnu, and the maternal circle.

Arundhati is the tongue, Dhruva is the tip of the nose, the star is called Vishnu's step, and the maternal circle is the eyebrow. ||599||

If one sees oneself being eaten in a dream by dogs, vultures, crows, or other nocturnal creatures, or if one sees oneself riding on a donkey, camel, or dog, or being dragged by them, then death will occur within a year. ||137||

Knowledge of Time
Yoga Shastra, Fifth Light, Verses 152-163

If one sees a person wearing a red garland around their neck, dressed in red clothes, riding a donkey, and heading south, knowing that they have smeared themselves with lep, then they will die in six months. ||151||

If one hears the sound of a bell suddenly in their body after consuming something, then their death is certain within five months. ||152||

If a chameleon climbs quickly onto someone's head and changes color three times while leaving, then that person will die within five months. ||153||

If someone's nose becomes crooked, their eyes become round, and their ears or other limbs become loose or displaced from their position, then they will die within four months. ||154||

If one sees a black man with a black family and a iron rod in their dream, then they will die within three months. ||155||

If one sees the moon as hot, the sun as cold, a hole in the earth and the sun, their tongue as black, and their face like a red lotus; and if their palate trembles, they have inexplicable sorrow in their mind, their body develops various colors, and they have sudden hiccups from their navel, then they will die within two months. ||156-157||

If someone's tongue cannot taste, their speech stumbles repeatedly, they cannot hear sounds, and their nose cannot smell; if their eyes constantly twitch, they experience confusion even when looking at objects, they see a rainbow at night and a meteor shower during the day; if they cannot see their own reflection in a mirror or water, they see lightning without thunder, and their head suddenly burns; if they see a flock of swans, crows, and peacocks somewhere, and they cannot feel the touch of cold, hot, rough, or soft; then if any one of these signs appears, that person will undoubtedly die within a month. ||158-162||

If someone's breath is cold when they open their mouth and pronounce the letter 'ha', their breath is cold when they blow, their memory and mental faculties decline, and their five limbs become cold, then they will die within ten days. ||163||

## Death Knowledge from One's Limbs

**Verse 163:** If one feels hot while taking out the fifth light of Yoga Shastra, loses memory, loses the ability to walk, and all five senses become cold, then death occurs within ten days.

**Verse 164:** If one's body becomes half hot and half cold, and suddenly flames start burning in the body, then death occurs within a week.

**Verse 165:** If one's chest and feet become dry immediately after bathing, then death occurs on the sixth day without a doubt.

**Verse 166:** If one grinds their teeth, has a foul odor like a corpse, changes color frequently, or has a distorted shadow, then death occurs within three days.

**Verse 167:** If one cannot see their nose, tongue, planets in the sky, stars, clear directions, or the seven sages, then death occurs within two days.

**Verse 168-172:** If one stands in the morning, evening, or on a bright night, hangs their arms down like the Kayotsarga mudra, and looks at their shadow for a while, then slowly raises their eyes from the shadow and looks up at the sky, they will see a human figure. If they cannot see their head in that figure, then they will die. If they cannot see their left arm, then their son or wife will die. If they cannot see their right arm, then their brother will die. If they cannot see their heart, then they will die. If they cannot see their stomach, then their wealth will be lost. If they cannot see their genitals, then their father or other respected elders will die. If they cannot see their thighs, then they will suffer from illness. If they cannot see their feet, then they will have to travel abroad. If they cannot see their entire body, then they will die soon.

**Other ways to know the time of death:**

**Verse 173:** By learning, one can know the time of death by looking at the mirror, thumb, or the reflection in water.

**Verse 174-176:** If one chants the name of the deity ten thousand and eight times during a solar or lunar eclipse, the deity will reveal the time of death. After chanting ten thousand and eight times, the deity will merge into the devotee, and then the devotee's daughter will reveal the time of death. The deity, attracted by the good qualities of the devotee, will reveal the time of death in all three times (past, present, and future) without any doubt.

## Knowledge of Time through Omens

**From Yoga Shastra, Fifth Light, Verses 177 to 185:**

**Meaning:** According to the method described by the Guru Maharaj, by using the Vidya (knowledge), the image of a deity, etc., can be invoked on a mirror, thumb, wall, or sword, etc., through proper rituals. By asking questions, the time (death) can be determined. (173) During a solar or lunar eclipse, one should chant the Vidya "Om Naravire Thah Thah Swaha" 10,800 times to make it potent. (174) When using this Vidya, one should chant it 1,080 times to invoke it on the mirror, sword, etc. (175) Then, a young, innocent girl should be shown the mirror, etc. When the girl sees the form of the deity in it, one should ask her about the lifespan and determine the outcome. Alternatively, the deity, attracted by the qualities of a virtuous seeker, will reveal the lifespan related to the three times (past, present, and future) without any doubt. (173-176)

Now, five verses describe the knowledge of time through omens:

**Or, one should know from omens whether a person is healthy or sick, whether it is from oneself or from another, whether it is inside the house or outside.** (177)

**Snakes, scorpions, worms, rats, lizards, ants, lice, bedbugs, spiders, termites, and honey-colored ants, when they appear in large numbers, indicate anxiety, distress, illness, or death.** (178-179)

**When a crow pecks at shoes, an elephant, a horse, or any other mount, or at an umbrella, weapon, shadow, body, or hair, then death is near.** (180)

**If cows with tear-filled eyes dig the earth deeply with their feet, then illness or death will befall their owner.** (181)

**Other ways to know the time:**

**This omen has been described for a healthy person. Now, the omen for a sick person is described.** (182)

**Omens related to dogs for a sick person:**

**If a dog, while the sick person is observing omens related to his lifespan, turns to the south and licks its anus, then the person will die in one day. If it licks the heart, then in two days, and if it licks the tail, then in three days.** (183)

**If, at the time of the omen, the dog lies down, contracting its entire body, or flaps its ears, or twists and shakes its body, then the sick person will die.** (184)

**If the dog lies down with its mouth open, drooling, with closed eyes, and contracting its body, then there is no doubt that the sick person will die.** (185)

**Now, two verses describe the omens of crows:**

## Determining Time from Auspicious Sounds (Dwividha-Upashruti)

**Yoga Shastra, Fifth Light, Verses 186-197**

**648.** If a flock of crows gathers and makes a noise at the house of a sick person, at all three sandhyas (dawn, noon, and dusk), then death is near. **186.**

**649.** If crows drop skin, bones, rope, or hair in the dining room or bedroom of a sick person, then death is imminent. **187.**

**Explanation:** Now, through nine verses, we will explain how to determine time through auspicious sounds (Upashruti).

**650.** A wise person should know the determination of time through auspicious sounds. On a favorable day, during the time of sleep, after one prahar (three hours) of the night has passed, while lying down, one should travel in the north, east, or west direction. **188.**

**651.** After performing five namaskaras (salutations) and reciting the Acharya mantra or the Shruti, one should leave the house with ears covered so that no sound can be heard. One should then travel towards the houses of artisans (Shilpis) and towards the market square or the main road in the aforementioned directions. **189.**

**652.** After performing an archanā (worship) of the earth with sandalwood and offering fragrant powder, akshata (unhusked rice), etc., one should carefully open their ears and listen to the sounds. **190.**

**653.** These sounds are of two types: 1. Arthanantara-Upadeshya (sounds with hidden meaning) and 2. Swarupa-Upashruti (sounds with direct meaning). The first type of sound requires contemplation (Vimarśa) to understand its intended meaning, while the second type directly conveys its meaning. **191.**

**654.** For example, "This pillar of the house will break in five or six days, five or six fortnights, five or six months, or five or six years, or it will not break at all." **192.**

**655.** "This pillar is very beautiful, but it is small and will be destroyed soon." This type of Upashruti is called Arthanantara-Upadeshya. **193.**

**656.** "This woman will not leave this place, this man will not leave here, or we will not let him go, and he does not want to go." **194.**

**657.** "This person wants to go, and I am eager to send him. Therefore, he will leave soon." This is called Swarupa-Upashruti. **195.**

**658.** Those who are skilled in this knowledge can determine the proximity of death or food by listening to the sounds that arise from the opening of the ears. **196.**

Therefore, he will leave soon." This is called Swarupa-Upashruti. Those who are skilled in this knowledge can determine the proximity of death or food by listening to the sounds that arise from the opening of the ears. **188-196.**

**659.** Now, we will explain the method of knowing time through the Shani (Saturn) person in four verses. In which constellation Shani is located, one should place four fingers on the right hand and three fingers on each foot. **197.**

If the evil planets are in the fourth or twelfth from the rising, then the knowers of time say that death will occur on the third day. ||204-205|| And. 668. If the evil planet is in the fifth from the rising, then death will occur in eight or ten days. ||206||. 669.

##  Knowledge of Victory and Defeat Time

**Yoga Shastra, Fifth Light, Verses 211 to 223**

**673 |**  One who wishes to determine their lifespan should face the sun with their back towards it at sunrise and observe their shadow. 

**674 |** If they see a full shadow, then they will not die for five years. 

**675 |** If they cannot see their hand, fingers, shoulder, hair, side, or nose, they will die in six months, one year, three years, five years, seven years, eight years, ten years, respectively. 

**676 |** If they cannot see their ear, they will die in twelve years. 

**677 |** If they cannot see their head or chin, they will die in six months. If they cannot see their neck, they will die in eleven days. If they see a hole in their heart, they will die in seven days. If they see two shadows, they should know that death is near. 

**212 |** If they cannot see their ear, they will die in twelve years. 

**213 |** If they cannot see their hand, fingers, shoulder, hair, side, or nose, they will die in ten, eight, seven, five, three, and one year, respectively. 

**214 |** If they cannot see their neck, they will die in eleven days. 

**215 |** If they see a hole in their heart, they will die in seven days. If they see two shadows, they should know that death is near. 

**678 |** This is how to determine lifespan using the yantra. Alternatively, one can use the knowledge described below. 

**679 |** First, place the word "Swa" on the crown of the head and the letter "A" on the forehead. Place "Kshi" on the eyes, "Pa" on the heart, and "Ha" on the navel. 

**680 |** Using this knowledge, chant the mantra 108 times while looking at your shadow. Face the sun with your back towards it at sunrise. 

**681 |** Chant the mantra for another person's shadow if you are determining their lifespan, and for your own shadow if you are determining your own lifespan. After performing the puja properly, observe the shadow. 

**682 |** If you see a full shadow, then you will not die for one year. If you cannot see your thigh, knee, or ankle, you will die in three, two, and one year, respectively. 

**683 |** If you cannot see your hip, you will die in ten months. If you cannot see your waist, you will die in eight or nine months. If you cannot see your chin, you will die in five months. 

**684 |** If you cannot see your neck, you will die in four, three, or two months. If you cannot see your armpit, you will die in ten days. If you cannot see your arm, you will die in ten days. 

**685 |** If you cannot see your shoulder, you will die in eight days. If you cannot see your heart, you will die in four days. If you cannot see your head, you will die in two hours. If you cannot see anything, you will die immediately.

## Knowledge of Victory and Defeat, Profit and Loss at the Time of Asking Questions

**Yoga Shastra, Fifth Light, Verses 224-230 Meaning:**

If the entire shadow is visible, then death will not occur for one year. If the feet, shanks, and knees are not visible, then death occurs in three, two, and one year respectively. If the thighs (calves) are not visible, then death occurs in ten months. If the waist is not visible, then death occurs in eight to nine months. If the stomach is not visible, then death occurs in five to six months. If the neck is not visible, then death occurs in four, three, two, or one month. If the armpit is not visible, then death occurs in fifteen days. If the arm is not visible, then death occurs in ten days. If the shoulder is not visible, then death occurs in eight days. If the heart is not visible, then death occurs in four praharas. If the head is not visible, then death occurs in two praharas. If the entire body is not visible, then death occurs immediately. ||220-223||

Now, the conclusion of the methods of knowing time is given. ||1686||

**Thus, the spiritual time is to be determined by the method of pranayama practice. Incidentally, the determination of external time is also explained. ||224||**

Now, the method of knowing victory and defeat is explained. ||687||

**Who will win in the battle of these two? When this question is asked, if the nadi is naturally full, i.e., the breath is being drawn inwards, then the one whose name is taken first will win. And if the nadi is empty, i.e., the air is going out, then the other will win. ||225||**

The characteristics of empty and full nadi are explained. ||1688||

**The place where the moving air goes out is called 'empty'. And where the air enters the nasal passage, that is called 'full' by the wise. ||226||**

Now, another method of knowing time is explained. ||689||

**If the questioner first takes the name of the knower and then the name of the patient, then the desired result will be achieved. If the opposite happens, then the result will be opposite. For example, 'Vaidyaraj! This patient will be healthy?' Then the patient will be healthy. And 'Will the patient be well or not, Vaidyaraj?' If the names are spoken in the opposite way, then the opposite result will be known, i.e., the patient will not be healthy. ||227||**

**And. ||690||**

**If the messenger stands on the left side and the name of the warrior has an even number of letters, then he will win. If the questioner stands on the right side and the warrior's name has an odd number of letters, then he will win in the battle. ||228||**

**And. ||1691||**

**If someone is possessed by a ghost or bitten by a snake, then the same method should be understood by the mantrikas when asking questions for them. ||229||**

**||692||**

**If the left side is full and the right side is empty, then the work started will be successful without a doubt. ||230||**

Answers to questions related to success of actions, non-success, and children
Meaning:
According to the 44th verse in the fifth light of Yoga Shastra, if the Varuṇamandala is flowing fully from the left nostril, then the actions started at that time are sure to be successful. || 230 || And
|| 693 | Victory, life, profit, and all other actions are all futile if the wind is in the right nostril. || 231 || And
Meaning:
|| 694 | A wise man, knowing the wind well, should drop a flower from his hand. He should then decide about life and death. || 232 || Meaning: - To gain special knowledge of life and death, a wise man, knowing the wind well, drops a flower from his hand and makes his decision. This is the method of that decision. || 232 ||
|| 695 | If the Varuṇamandala is rising, there will be immediate profit, if the Purandara (Earth Mandala) is rising, there will be profit after a long time, if the wind is blowing, there will be little profit, and if the Agni Mandala is blowing, even a successful work will be destroyed. || 233 || And
Meaning:
|| 696 | If the Varuṇamandala is active when a question is asked about a person who has gone to a village or country, he will return soon, if the question is asked in the Purandaramandala, he is happy where he has gone, if the question is asked in the wind mandala, he has gone elsewhere, and if the question is asked in the Agni Mandala, say that he has died. || 234 || And
|| 697 | If a question about war is asked in the Agni Mandala, there will be a terrible war and defeat. If the question is asked in the wind mandala, the person for whom the question was asked will die and the army will be destroyed. || 235 ||
Meaning:
|| 698 | If the question is asked in the Mahendra Mandala, i.e., the earth element, there will be victory in the war, if the question is asked in the Varuṇamandala, there will be more than desired profit, and there will be a treaty with the defeat of the enemy, indicating one's own success. || 236 || And
|| 699 | If the question about rain is asked in the Bhūma Mandala, there will be rain, if the question is asked in the Varuṇamandala, there will be more rain than expected, if the question is asked in the wind mandala, there will be bad days and clouds, but no rain, and if the question is asked in the Agni Mandala, there will be little rain. || 237 ||
|| 700 | If the question about the production of crops is asked in the Varuṇamandala, there will be production of crops, if the question is asked in the Purandaramandala, there will be a lot of production of crops, if the question is asked in the wind mandala, there will be medium production of crops; it will be in some places and not in others, and if the question is asked in the Agni Mandala, there will be no production of crops at all. || 238 || || 701 | Mahendra and Varuṇamandala are good for questions about pregnancy, they give birth to a son. The wind and fire are good for women, and the void destroys the fetus. || 239 || Meaning: - In questions related to pregnancy, Mahendra and Varuṇamandala are superior, if the question is asked in them, a son is obtained, the wind and

## Chapter 5, Verses 240-258 of Yoga Shastra:

**Verse 239:** If a question is asked while the Agni Mandala is active, a daughter will be born. If the question is asked while the Sushumna Nadi is active, the fetus will be destroyed.

**Verse 240:** When entering or leaving a house, a royal palace, or any other place, one should place the foot on the side of the nostril from which the air is flowing forward. This will ensure the success of the desired task.

**Verse 241:** When desiring the success of a task, one should approach a guru, a friend, a king, a minister, or any other person from whom one desires something, with the foot on the side of the nostril from which the air is flowing forward. This will ensure the success of the desired task.

**Verse 242:** When sitting or sleeping, one should place women on the side of the nostril from which the air is flowing. This will make them submissive. There is no other magic or spell more powerful than this.

**Verse 243:** Those who desire victory, wealth, and happiness should place enemies, thieves, debtors, and other sources of trouble and conflict on the side of the nostril from which the air is not flowing. This will prevent them from causing harm.

**Verse 244:** Those who protect themselves with their Purnaanga (the side of the nostril from which the air is flowing) from the attacks of enemies will not be harmed even by the strongest enemies.

**Verse 245-246:** If the question is asked while the left or right nostril of the respondent is active, a son will be born. If the question is asked while the nostril is inactive, a daughter will be born. If the question is asked while the air is flowing through the Sushumna Nadi, twins will be born. If the question is asked while the air is flowing through the empty space, a eunuch will be born. If the question is asked while the air is transitioning between the two nostrils, the fetus will be destroyed. If the question is asked while all the elements are balanced, there will be peace and well-being.

**Verse 247:** Some teachers say that if the question is asked while the Chandra Svar (lunar breath) is active, a daughter will be born. If the question is asked while the Surya Svar (solar breath) is active, a son will be born. If the question is asked while the Sushumna Nadi is active, a eunuch will be born.

**Verse 248:** If the flow of the Purandara (air) is not clear, one should determine its direction using the color of the bindu (dots): yellow, white, red, and black.

The fruit of Nadi Sanchar Gyan, the method of observation

Yoga Shastra Pancham Prakash Slokas 249 to 259 describe the method of seeing the bindu in two slokas. 711. With both thumbs, cover both ear holes, with the middle fingers, cover both nostrils, with the ring and little fingers, cover the mouth, and with the index fingers, press both corners of the eyes. Then, holding the breath, observe with a calm mind what color bindu appears in the brow. 249. 712. By pressing the corners diagonally with the fingers, holding the breath, observe the bindu with a calm mind. 250. _Meaning: By pressing both ear holes with both thumbs, both nostrils with the middle fingers, the mouth with the ring and little fingers, and both corners of the eyes with the index fingers, holding the breath, observe with a calm mind what color bindu appears in the brow. 249-250. _

Knowing the bindu helps determine the pavan. 713. If a yellow bindu appears, it is Purandar Vayu, if a white bindu appears, it is Varun Vayu, if a black bindu appears, it is Pavan Vayu, and if a red bindu appears, it is Agni Vayu. 251. _Meaning: If a yellow bindu appears, it is Purandar Vayu, if a white bindu appears, it is Varun Vayu, if a black bindu appears, it is Pavan Vayu, and if a red bindu appears, it is Agni Vayu. 251. _

Methods are given to stop the unwanted nadi and start the desired nadi. 714. If the left or right nadi is flowing unwanted, immediately press that side of the body so that the other nadi flows. 252. _Meaning: If the left or right nadi is flowing unwanted, immediately press that side of the body so that the other nadi flows. 252. _

The area in front of the left side of the body is called the Chandra Kshetra, and the area behind the right side of the body is called the Surya Kshetra. 715. 716. Only those who know the flow of Vayu can truly understand profit and loss, happiness and sorrow, life and death. 254. _Meaning: The area in front of the left side of the body is called the Chandra Kshetra, and the area behind the right side of the body is called the Surya Kshetra. 715. 716. Only those who know the flow of Vayu can truly understand profit and loss, happiness and sorrow, life and death. 254. _

Now, the method of knowing the purity of the nadi through the flow of pavan is described. 717. All this is born of Vayu, and from it comes the power to purify the nadi. The wise man who truly knows this is free from delusion. 255. _Meaning: All this is born of Vayu, and from it comes the power to purify the nadi. The wise man who truly knows this is free from delusion. 255. _

Now, the method of nadi shuddhi is described in four slokas. 718. Contemplate the 'ha' sound, which is situated in the karnika of the navel lotus, purified by kala and bindu, surrounded by the refa, and radiating light. 256. 719. Then, let it flow through the Surya Nadi, like lightning, filled with hundreds of sparks and flames, reaching the sky. 257. 720. Then, bring it down slowly, bathing it in nectar, and let it enter the navel lotus, shining like the moon, through the Chandra Nadi. 258. 721. By constantly practicing this way of entering and exiting, the practitioner attains nadi shuddhi. 259. _Meaning: Contemplate the 'ha' sound, which is situated in the karnika of the navel lotus, purified by kala and bindu, surrounded by the refa, and radiating light. 256. 719.

##  Vedha-Vidhi, Parakaya Pravesha Vidhi - and Conclusion

**Yoga Shastra Pancham Prakash Shloka 260 to 271**

**Shloka 260:**

**Meaning:**  A wise person skilled in the practice of Nadi-Shuddhi can, at will, transfer the air from one nostril (Nadi) to the other instantly.

**Shloka 261:**

**Meaning:**  The air remains in one nostril for two and a half ghatikas (one hour) and then moves to the other nostril. This is how the change occurs. In a healthy person, there are 21,600 breaths (Pranavayu) in a day and night.

**Shloka 262:**

**Meaning:**  Those who do not understand the flow of air are not qualified to make judgments about the truth.

**Shloka 263:**

**Meaning:**  How can a person with a dull mind, who doesn't even understand the flow of air, talk about the truth? Knowing the flow of air is essential for understanding the truth.

**Shloka 264:**

**Meaning:**  When the air is inhaled through the Puraka Kriya, the heart lotus (Hridya Padma) turns downwards and contracts. When Kumbhaka is performed in the same heart lotus, it expands and turns upwards.

**Shloka 265:**

**Meaning:**  Then, through the Rechaka Kriya, draw the air from the heart lotus. Do not exhale this air; instead, make it flow upwards, breaking through the knot in the path, and bring it to the Brahma Randhra.

**Shloka 266:**

**Meaning:**  With curiosity, the yogi should exhale this air from the Brahma Randhra and, with focus, slowly direct it towards the cotton wool of the Ak plant.

**Shloka 267:**

**Meaning:**  Practice this repeatedly on the cotton wool of the Ak plant. When you become proficient in bringing the air to the Brahma Randhra and then to the cotton wool, you should, with steady focus, direct the air towards the flowers of the Malati and Chameli plants.

**Shloka 268:**

**Meaning:**  When your practice becomes strong and the Varuna Vayu is flowing, you should direct the air towards fragrant substances like camphor, agarwood, and kustha.

**Shloka 269:**

**Meaning:**  When you have mastered directing the air towards these substances, you should, with skill in controlling the air, direct it towards the bodies of small birds.

**Shloka 270:**

**Meaning:**  With practice, you should direct the air towards the bodies of butterflies, bees, and animals, with a focused mind and controlled senses.

**Shloka 271:**

**Meaning:**  You should practice directing the air towards the bodies of humans, horses, and birds, and then towards objects like books and stones, in a gradual manner.

## Conclusion

In the fifth light of the Yoga Shastra, verses 272 and 273, when success is achieved and proficiency in releasing air in all the aforementioned combinations is attained, one should attempt to penetrate the dead bodies of small birds. After practicing penetration in the dead bodies of moths, bumblebees, etc., one should also begin practicing with deer, etc. Then, with a focused mind, patience, and controlled senses, the yogi should enter and exit the dead bodies of humans, horses, elephants, etc., in sequence. They should also enter stone statues, puppets, and divine images. || 264 - 271 ||

Concluding, the remaining points worth mentioning are:

|| 734 || One should enter the dead bodies through the left nostril. Entering a living body is not mentioned due to the fear of sin arising from the possibility of causing another's death. || 272 ||

**Meaning:** Entering a living body is akin to using weapons and causing harm, and is therefore not something that should be discussed. One cannot enter another's body without causing their death. It is essentially a form of violence. The commentary provides insight into this, which is as follows:

Exiting through the Brahma-randhra, one should enter through the Apana (anus) path. After entering, one should take refuge in the navel lotus and reach the heart lotus through the Sushumna nadi. There, one should block the flow of the other's life force with their own air, and hold it until the body becomes motionless and falls. Within a moment, the soul will be liberated from that body. Then, with the senses functioning on their own, the yogi should engage in all activities using that body as if it were their own. The wise person should play in another's body for half a day or a full day, and then enter their own body using this method. This is the fruit of entering another's body.

|| 735 || Through this gradual practice of entering another's body, the wise yogi, empowered by this practice, becomes free from attachment, like a liberated soul, and can move about at will. || 273 ||

|| Thus, the fifth light of the Yoga Shastra, known as the Adhyatma Upanishad, composed by Acharya Shri Hemchandracharya Suri, with its explanation of the Khop, is complete, fulfilling the curiosity of King Shri Kumarapala. ||

6. Sixth Light "Parakaya-Pravesh is not Paramarthika" |736| This Parapur-Pravesh is only a matter of wonder, it does not have even a fraction of Paramarth in it and its Siddhi also happens only after great effort for a very long time and maybe not even then. Therefore, it is not appropriate for a seeker of liberation to make such an effort. Even after conquering the wind with various postures, which are the causes of suffering, even after controlling the flow of the Nadis within the body, and even after achieving Siddhi in Parakaya-Pravesh, which no one else can believe in, the one who remains attached to the knowledge that is full of sin, cannot achieve the path of liberation. ||1-3|| Many Acharyas believe that Pranayama leads to the Siddhi of meditation, this pre-stated point is refuted by two shlokas. |739| The mind does not become healthy by Pranayama, which is full of suffering; because the suppression of the Pranas causes pain in the body. There is effort in Puran, Kumbhan and Rechan kriyas. Due to the effort, there is Sanklesh in the mind. Therefore, Pranayama is an obstacle to liberation because it causes Sanklesh in the mind. ||4-5|| Explanation: Here there is a doubt that if Pranayama causes pain in the body and restlessness in the mind, then what other path is there, which does not cause pain in the body and restlessness in the mind? The answer to this is that "after Pranayama, many Acharyas tell about Pratyahar; it is not contaminated." ||4-5|| It is called |741| With the senses, the mind is withdrawn from the objects, the mind becomes calm. Therefore, for the sake of Dharma-Dhyan, the mind should be made steady. ||6|| Explanation: Withdrawing the mind from external objects along with the senses is called Pratyahar. We have explained in Abhidhan Chintamani Kosha - Pratyaharastvindriyanam vishebhyah samaahriti. That is, withdrawing the eyes and other senses from the objects like form etc. is called Pratyahar. The point of making the mind steady is said to initiate the explanation of Dharana after Pratyahar. ||6||
Now the places of Dharana are explained.

## The Order of Meditation Practice, the Nature of the Pindastha

**Yoga Shastra, Seventh Light, Verses 10 to 19**

**752.** There are five Dharanas in the Pindastha Dhyeya: 1. Parthivī, 2. Āgneya, 3. Māruti, 4. Vārunī, and 5. Tattvabhū. ||9||

**753.** The Parthivī Dharana is described in three verses. ||753||

**754.** Contemplate the Tiryanchloka, which is the size of a rope, and a vast ocean of milk, as wide and long as the Tiryanchloka. In that ocean, contemplate a lotus with a thousand petals, the size of Jambudvipa, and shining like gold. ||10||

**755.** Contemplate the golden filaments within the lotus, radiating a brilliant yellow light, and the Karnika (pedicel) as tall as Mount Sumeru, a hundred thousand yojanas high. ||11||

**756.** Contemplate your own peaceful self, seated on a white lion throne, ready to eradicate karma, within the Karnika. This is called the Parthivī Dharana. ||12||

**757.** Now, the Āgneya Dharana is described in six verses. ||756||

**758.** Contemplate a lotus with sixteen petals within your navel. Place the Maha Mantra "Aham" in the Karnika, and on each petal, place the sixteen vowels in order: "A, Ā, I, Ī, U, Ū, Ṛ, Ṛ, Lu, Lu, E, Ai, O, Au, An, Ah". ||13||

**759.** Contemplate the "Ha" letter of the Maha Mantra, which is composed of Refa, Bindu, and Kala. From the Refa, contemplate a smoke-like flame rising slowly. ||14||

**760.** Contemplate a stream of sparks emanating from the flame, followed by a continuous chain of flames. Then, contemplate these flames burning the lotus with eight petals, situated in the heart. ||15||

**761.** On each petal of this lotus, place the eight karmas in order: 1. Jñānāvaraṇa, 2. Darśanāvaraṇa, 3. Vedaniya, 4. Mohaniya, 5. Āyu, 6. Nāma, 7. Gotra, and 8. Antarāya. This lotus should be facing downwards. ||16||

**762.** Contemplate the powerful fire, born from the meditation on the Maha Mantra "Aham", burning the eight-karma lotus, which is facing downwards. ||17||

**763.** Then, contemplate a triangular fire pit outside the body, marked with a Swastika symbol, and containing the fire seed "Ra". ||18||

**764.** Contemplate the fire flame born from the meditation on the Maha Mantra within the body, and the fire pit flame outside the body, burning the body and the eight-karma lotus. Immediately, contemplate the fire extinguishing itself, leaving only ashes. This is the Āgneya Dharana. ||19||

**765.** Know the "Aham" seed, situated in the Siddha Chakra, as the Maha Mantra. ||13-18||

**766.** Now, the Vāyavī Dharana is described in two verses. ||762||

**767.** Contemplate the wind, filling the three worlds, moving mountains and oceans, and causing disturbances. ||19||

## The Nature of Padmasth Dhyana

**Yoga Shastra, Eighth Prakash, Verses 10-22**

1781.  **Verse 10:**  One should remember the *naad* (sound) as it travels through the middle path, breaking through the knots of the *naabhi* (navel), *kanth* (throat), *hrid* (heart), and *ghantika* (bell) etc., with a very subtle sound.

1782.  **Verse 11:**  Then one should contemplate the *antaratma* (inner self) being bathed in the waves of nectar, white like milk, emanating from the *kala* (time) heated by the *bindu* (point).

1783.  **Verse 12:**  Then one should place the self within the sixteen-petaled lotus of the *sudharasa* (sweet nectar) *suta* (son) and contemplate the sixteen *vidya devi* (goddesses of knowledge) on its petals.

1784.  **Verse 13:**  One should contemplate for a long time in the mind, the self being bathed in the nectar, white like milk, flowing from the brilliant crystal *bhṛngāra* (bee).

1785.  **Verse 14:**  Then one should meditate on the *Arhat* (the worthy one), the first *abhidheya* (name) of the *mantra raja* (king of mantras), the supreme being, in the head, pure and clear like a crystal.

1786.  **Verse 15:**  Due to the intensity of this meditation, one should repeatedly utter "So'ham, So'ham" (I am that, I am that) and without any doubt, know the oneness of the self with the supreme self.

1787.  **Verse 16:**  Then one should meditate on the supreme self, free from attachment and aversion, free from delusion, all-knowing, all-seeing, worshipped by the gods, residing in the *samavasarana* (assembly hall), delivering the teachings of Dharma.

1788.  **Verse 17:**  By meditating on the self in this way, as inseparable from the supreme self, the meditator, cleansed of all impurities, attains the supreme selfhood.

**Meaning:**  Alternatively, one should contemplate a lotus with eight petals below the navel. On the first petal of this lotus, one should contemplate the sixteen *swaravali* (musical notes) in the form of beautiful *kesara* (stamens). On the remaining seven petals, one should establish the seven *varga* (classes) in order. This is as follows: 1. *ka*, *kha*, *ga*, *gha*, *nga*, 2. *cha*, *chha*, *ja*, *jha*, *nya*, 3. *ta*, *tha*, *da*, *dha*, *na*, 4. *ta*, *tha*, *da*, *dha*, *na*, 5. *pa*, *pha*, *ba*, *bha*, *ma*, 6. *ya*, *ra*, *la*, *va*, 7. *sha*, *sha*, *sa*, *ha*. At the junctions of these eight petals, one should establish the *siddha* (perfected being) *stuti* (praise) in the form of *hrim* sound. And at the front of all the petals, one should establish "Om Hrim". In the middle of that lotus, one should establish the first letter "a" and the last letter "ha" along with the *ref* (sound) and *bindu* (dot), bright like snow, as the "Aham" (I). Remembering this "Aham" in the mind purifies the soul. The pronunciation of the word "Aham" should be done first in the mind with a *hasvanad* (short sound). Later, it should be pronounced with a *dirgha* (long sound), then *plut* (very long sound), then *sukshma* (subtle sound), and then *atisukshma* (very subtle sound). After that, that *naad* (sound) breaks through the knots of the *naabhi* (navel), *hrid* (heart), and *kanth* (throat) etc., and moves forward through the middle of them all. One should contemplate this. Then one should contemplate that the *antaratma* (inner self) is being bathed in the waves of nectar, white like milk, emanating from the *kala* (time) heated by the *bindu* (point). Then one should imagine a lake of nectar and contemplate a lotus with sixteen petals arising from that lake. One should establish oneself within it and contemplate the sixteen *vidya devi* (goddesses of knowledge) on those petals in order. Later, one should contemplate in the mind, for a long time, the self being irrigated by the nectar, white like milk, flowing from the brilliant crystal *bhṛngāra* (bee). Then one should meditate on the *Arhat* (the worthy one), the first *abhidheya* (name) of the *mantra raja* (king of mantras), the supreme being, in the head, pure and clear like a crystal. This meditation should be so powerful and profound that due to its contemplation, the meditator, repeatedly uttering "So'ham, So'ham" (I am that, I am that) in the inner voice, should experience the oneness of the self with the supreme self without any doubt. Then one should meditate on the supreme self, free from attachment and aversion, free from delusion, all-knowing, all-seeing, worshipped by the gods, residing in the *samavasarana* (assembly hall), delivering the teachings of Dharma. By meditating on the self in this way, as inseparable from the supreme self, the meditator, cleansed of all impurities, attains the supreme selfhood.

**Verses 6-17**

There are also other methods of meditating on the *padmasth* (lotus-seated) deity, described in five verses.

1789.  **Verse 18:**  Alternatively, the wise meditator should contemplate the *mantra adhip* (master of mantras), combined with the upward and downward *ref* (sound), encompassed by the *kala* (time) and *bindu* (point), and also with the *anahata* (unstruck sound).

1790.  **Verse 19:**  One should contemplate it residing in the heart of a golden lotus, pure like the dense rays of the moon, moving in the sky, and pervading all directions.

1791.  **Verse 20:**  Then one should contemplate it entering the lotus of the mouth, moving in the dust particles, shining in the eyes, and residing in the forehead.

1792.  **Verse 21:**  One should contemplate it exiting through the hole in the ear, flowing as sweet nectar, competing with the moon, and shining in the light.

1793.  **Verse 22:**  One should contemplate it moving in the sky, uniting with the auspiciousness of Shiva, complete in all its parts, with *kumbhaka* (breath retention).

**Meaning:**  Alternatively, the wise meditator should contemplate the *mantra adhip* (master of mantras), combined with the upward and downward *ref* (sound), encompassed by the *kala* (time) and *bindu* (point), and also with the *anahata* (unstruck sound), residing in the heart of a golden lotus, pure like the dense rays of the moon, moving in the sky, and pervading all directions. Then one should contemplate it entering the lotus of the mouth, moving in the dust particles, shining in the eyes, and residing in the forehead. One should contemplate it exiting through the hole in the ear, flowing as sweet nectar, competing with the moon, and shining in the light. One should contemplate it moving in the sky, uniting with the auspiciousness of Shiva, complete in all its parts, with *kumbhaka* (breath retention).

## The Nature of Padasthan Dhyana

**From verses 23 to 28 of the eighth chapter of Yoga Shastra, contemplate the "Aham" (I) mantra, which is the lord of mantras and resides in the Anahata chakra.**  Then, entering the lotus of the mouth, wandering in the "Bhoolata" (forgetfulness), shining in the eyes, residing in the forehead, exiting through the hole in the palate, showering nectar, competing with the moon in brilliance, shining brightly in the celestial sphere, moving through the sky, and uniting with the Lakshmi of liberation, the wise yogi should contemplate the "Aham" mantra, the king of mantras, which is filled with all the elements, through Kumbhaka (breath control). ||18-22||

It is said that "Akar" is at its beginning, "Hakar" is at its end, and "Ref" with a dot is in the middle. This is the supreme truth. He who knows this is truly a knower of the truth. ||1||

**Meaning:** The "Aham" is the supreme truth, whose beginning is "Akar", whose end is "Hakar", and whose middle is "Ref" with a dot. He who knows this is truly a knower of the truth. Now, the fruit of meditating on the king of mantras is described. ||1||

**This great truth, when the yogi meditates on it steadily, then the Lakshmi of liberation, like a land of bliss, appears before him.** ||23||

**Then, the method is explained:**

**After that, meditate on the bright "H" letter, devoid of "Ref", dot, and "Kala". Then, consider it as if it has become a non-letter, and contemplate it without uttering it.** ||24||

**Meaning:** After that, meditate on the bright "H" letter, devoid of "Ref", dot, and "Kala". Then, consider it as if it has become a non-letter, and contemplate it without uttering it. ||24||

**Then, contemplate the Anahata deity, which is subtle, like the crescent moon, and radiant like the sun, as if it has attained the form of a non-letter, without uttering it.** ||25||

**Meaning:** Then, contemplate the Anahata deity, which is subtle, like the crescent moon, and radiant like the sun, as if it has attained the form of a non-letter, without uttering it. ||25||

**Then, gradually meditate on the same Anahata "H" in its subtle form, like the tip of a hair. Then, for a moment, see the world as formless and luminous.** ||26||

**Meaning:** Then, gradually meditate on the same Anahata "H" in its subtle form, like the tip of a hair. Then, for a moment, see the world as formless and luminous. ||26||

**Then, gradually withdrawing the mind from the object, and establishing it in the non-object, a light arises within, which is imperishable and beyond the senses. It gradually opens the inner space.** ||27||

**Meaning:** Then, gradually withdrawing the mind from the object, and establishing it in the non-object, a light arises within, which is imperishable and beyond the senses. It gradually opens the inner space. ||27||

**Thus, by taking the object as a support, the non-object is illuminated. The sage, whose mind is established in the non-object, achieves his desired goal.** ||28||

**Meaning:** Thus, by taking the object as a support, the non-object is illuminated. The sage, whose mind is established in the non-object, achieves his desired goal. ||28||

**Meaning:** In this way, the Anahata-Avyakt (unmanifest) mantra-king is described. Following the aforementioned method, one should take the object as a support and progress, gradually abandoning the support and becoming steady in the state of non-support. This reveals the true nature of the self. Therefore, one should first meditate with support and then without support. ||28||

**Now, the method of meditation on the mantra-deity, which represents the Supreme Being, is explained in two verses through another method.** ||431||

## The Nature of Padmastha Dhyana

**Yoga Shastra, Eighth Prakash, Verses 29-37**

**Meaning:**

**800.**  One should meditate on the **Shabda Brahma**, the sole cause of creation, residing in the center of the heart lotus, composed of vowels and consonants, the speaker of the Pancha Parameshthis. ||29||

**801.**  One should meditate on the **Pranava** (Om), the great mantra, emanating from the moon-like brilliance residing on the head, drenched in the nectar of the divine arts, using **Kumbhaka** (breath retention). ||30||

**802.**  One should meditate on the **Om** of yellow color for **Sthambhana** (immobilization), red for **Vashya** (subjugation), coral-colored for **Kshobhana** (agitation), black for **Vidveshana** (hatred), and white like the moon for **Karmaghnata** (destruction of karma). ||31||

**Meaning:**  Although it is appropriate for those seeking the destruction of karma to meditate on the **Om** that shines like the moon, in various situations involving substances, fields, time, and emotions, meditating on other colors like yellow can also be beneficial. Therefore, the practice of meditating on **Om** is prescribed here. ||31||

**Another method of meditating on the Padmaya Devata:**

**803.**  The yogi should especially meditate on the **Pancha Parameshthi Namaskara Mantra**, the great, most auspicious mantra that purifies the three worlds. ||32||

**This can be done as follows:**

**804.**  One should contemplate a white lotus with eight petals, and in its center, the seven-syllabled, pure mantra **"Namo Arihantaṇam"**. ||33||

**805.**  Then, one should contemplate the four mantra-words **"Siddhādik"** in the petals of the four directions, and the four words of the **"Chūlā-Pāda"** in the petals of the intercardinal directions. ||34||

**Meaning:**  One should contemplate **"Namo Siddhāṇam"** in the east, **"Namo Āryāṇam"** in the south, **"Namo Uvvajjhāyāṇam"** in the west, and **"Namo Loe Savvasāhūṇam"** in the north. In the intercardinal directions, one should contemplate **"Eso Panca Namukkāro"** in the southeast, **"Savvapāvappaṇāsano"** in the southwest, **"Mangalāṇam ca Savveṛsi"** in the northwest, and **"Padhamaṁ Havvai Mangalaṁ"** in the northeast. In this way, one should meditate on the **Pancha Parameshthi Namaskara Mantra**. ||34||

**Now, the fruits of contemplating the mantra are described:**

**806.**  A muni who contemplates this mantra with purity of mind, speech, and body, even while eating, receives the fruit of four days of fasting by chanting it one hundred and eight times. ||35||

**807.**  By properly worshipping this great mantra, yogis become highly respected in the three worlds and attain supreme prosperity. ||36||

**808.**  Even those who have committed thousands of sins and killed hundreds of beings, by worshipping this mantra, attain heaven even if they are born as animals. ||37||

The Nature of Padasthan Dhyana
Yoga Shastra Ashtama Prakash Sloka 45 to 56
||816. If you wish to extinguish the fire of your worldly existence even for a moment, then you should remember the first mantra, the first seven letters 'Namo Arihantaanam'. ||45||
Meaning
They prescribe two other mantras.
||817. Remember the five-letter mantra 'Namo Siddhaanam' which destroys karma, and meditate on the mantra adorned with alphabets 'Om Namo Arhate Kevaline Paramyoginie Visphuraduru Shukladhyanaagninirdagdhakarmabeejaya Prasaanant Chaturshtaya Soumyaya Shantaya Mangalavaradaya Ashtaadashadosha-rahitaya Swaha' which grants all kinds of protection. ||46||
Meaning: To destroy the eight karmas, one should meditate on the five-letter mantra 'Namo Siddhaanam', and to obtain all kinds of protection, one should meditate on the mantra adorned with alphabets 'Om Namo Arhate Kevaline Paramyoginie Visphuraduru Shukladhyanaagninirdagdhakarmabeejaya Prasaanant Chaturshtaya Soumyaya Shantaya Mangalavaradaya Ashtaadashadosha-rahitaya Swaha'. ||46||
They describe the Kar mantra with its fruits in ten slokas.
||818. Meditate on a white lotus with eight petals inside the mouth, and place the letters 'Om Namo Arihantaanam' on them in order. ||47|| ||819. Adorn it with saffron-colored, melodious, nectar-like drops, and let the nectar fall from the moon-like center of the lotus. ||48|| ||820. Contemplate the 'Hrim' Mayabeeja, which is moving in the mouth, in the middle of the halo of light, and is as bright as nectar. ||49|| ||821. Then contemplate it moving on the petals, moving in the sky, destroying the darkness of the mind, and flowing with nectar. ||50|| ||822. Contemplate it going through the hole in the palate, shining in the space between the eyebrows, with unimaginable greatness in the three worlds, like a wonderful light. ||51|| ||823. By meditating on this mantra with a pure and focused mind, the impurities of speech and mind are removed, and Shruta Jnana is revealed. ||52|| ||824. After practicing for six months, the mind becomes steady, and one sees the smoke rising from the lotus of the mouth. ||53|| ||825. After practicing for a year, one sees the flame, and then, with a special feeling, one sees the lotus face of the omniscient. ||54|| ||826. Then, one sees the omniscient directly, shining with the greatness of auspiciousness, full of all perfections, and residing in the halo of light. ||55|| ||827. Then, with the mind fixed on the self, one becomes certain, and crossing the wilderness of the world, one resides in the temple of Siddhi. ||56||
Meaning: Meditate on a white lotus with eight petals inside the mouth, and place the letters 'Om Namo Arihantaanam' on them in order. The eight groups of letters are: 1. A, Aa, I, Ii, U, Uu, Ri, Ri, Lri, Lri, E, Ai, O, Au, An, Ah, 2. K, Kh, G, Gh, N, 3. Ch, Chh, J, Jh, N, 4. T, Th, D, Dh, N, 5. T, Th, D, Dh, N, 6. P, Ph, B, Bh, M, 7. Y, R, L, V, 8. Sh, Shh, S, H. Adorn the lotus with saffron-colored, melodious, nectar-like drops, and let the nectar fall from the moon-like center of the lotus. Then contemplate the 'Hrim' Mayabeeja, which is moving in the mouth, in the middle of the halo of light, and is as bright as nectar. Then contemplate it moving on the petals, moving in the sky, destroying the darkness of the mind, and flowing with nectar. Contemplate it going through the hole in the palate, shining in the space between the eyebrows, with unimaginable greatness in the three worlds, like a wonderful light. By meditating on this mantra with a pure and focused mind, the impurities of speech and mind are removed, and Shruta Jnana is revealed. After practicing for six months, the mind becomes steady, and one sees the smoke rising from the lotus of the mouth. After practicing for a year, one sees the flame, and then, with a special feeling, one sees the lotus face of the omniscient. Then, one sees the omniscient directly, shining with the greatness of auspiciousness, full of all perfections, and residing in the halo of light. Then, with the mind fixed on the self, one becomes certain, and crossing the wilderness of the world, one resides in the temple of Siddhi. ||47-56||
Up to this point, they have described the meditation on the Mayabeeja. Now they speak about the Vijnana Vidya.

**Vidyaam 'kshvi' iti bhaalastam, dhyaayet kalyanakaranam.** ||57.||

**Meaning:** The practitioner should meditate on the 'Kshvi' Vidya, which is born from the disc of the moon and eternally showers nectar, establishing it on their forehead for the sake of their welfare. ||57.||

**Tatha** ||829. **Kshiraambhodher viniryanti, plavayanți sudhaambhubhih.**
**Bhale shashikalaam dhyaayet, siddhisopanapadhatim.** ||58.||

**Meaning:** One should meditate on the moon's crescent on their forehead, which emerges from the ocean of milk and floats all beings with nectar-like water, like a series of steps leading to the palace of Siddhis. ||58.||

**The fruit of this meditation is described:** ||830. **Asyaah smaranamatren, trutyadbhavanibandhanah.**
**Prayati paramānanda-karanam padam avyayam.** ||59.||

**Meaning:** By merely remembering this moon's crescent, the practitioner's bondage of birth and death, the cause of worldly existence, is destroyed, and they attain the imperishable state of liberation, the cause of supreme bliss. ||59.||

||831. **Nasagre pranavah shunyam anahatamiti trayam.**
**Dhyayan gunashtakam labdhva jnanam apnoti nirmalam.** ||60.||

**Meaning:** The one who meditates on the three (Om, 0, and Ha) - Pranava 'Om', Shunya '0', and Anahata 'Ha' - on the tip of their nose, attains eight Siddhis (powers) and pure knowledge. ||60.||

||832. **Shankha-kunda-shashankabhan, trinamoon dhyaayatah sada.**
**Samagravishayajnan-pragalbhyam jayate nrinaam.** ||61.||

**Meaning:** The person who constantly meditates on these three - Pranava, Shunya, and Anahata - which are as radiant as a conch shell, jasmine, and the moon, becomes proficient in the knowledge of all subjects. ||61.||

**Tatha** ||833. **Dwipaashvapranavadvandam prantayormāyayāvṛtam.**
**'So'ham' madhye vimurdhānam 'amli'mkaram vicintayet.** ||62.||

**Meaning:** One should meditate on this mantra: 'Hrim Om Om So Amli Om Om Hrim', where there are two Om's on either side, Hrim on both ends (edges), So'ham in the middle, and Amli in the middle of So'ham. ||62.||

||834. **Kamadhenumivācinty-phal-sampadan-kshamām.**
**Anavadyaam japeedvidyaam ganabhrud-vadanod-gatām.** ||63.||

**Meaning:** One should chant the flawless Vidya that emerged from the mouth of Lord Ganadhara, which is capable of granting unimaginable fruits like the Kamadhenu. This Vidya is: 'Om Jogge Magge Tacche Bhue Bhavve Bhavisse Ante Pakkhe Jinpase Swaha'. ||63.||

||835. **Shatkone'pratichakre, phat iti pratyekam aksharam.**
**Savye nyased 'vichakray svaha' baahye'pasavyatah.** ||64.||

||836. **Bhutaantam bindusamyuktam, tanmadhye nyasya chintayet.**
**'Namo jinaanam' ityādyaiḥ, 'Om' pūrve'shtayed bahiḥ.** ||65.||

**Meaning:** First, contemplate the six-angled Yantra. Write one of the six letters 'Apratichakre Phat' in each compartment of this Yantra. Outside this Yantra, write one letter of 'Vichakray Swaha' in reverse order near the corners. Then, place 'Om Namo Jinaanam' and the following mantras in the outer circle: 'Om Namo Ohijinaanam, Om Namo Paramohijinaanam, Om Namo Savvosahjinaanam, Om Namo Anatohibijanam, Om Namo Kottbuddhinaam, Om Namo Biybuddhinaam, Om Namo Payanusarinaam, Om Namo Sambhinnsoanaam, Om Namo Ujjumainaam, Om Namo Viulamainaam, Om Namo Daspuvinaam, Om Namo Chaudaspuvinaam, Om Namo Attungmahaanimitta-kusalaanam, Om Namo Viuvvaniddhipattanam, Om Namo Vijjahaaranaam, Om Namo Charanaanam, Om Namo Pannaasamanaanam, Om Namo Aagasgaaminaam, Om Jsoum Jsoum Shrim Hrim Dhriti-Kirti-Buddhi-Lakshmi Swaha'. This completes the outer circle. Then, by placing the five parts of the Pancha-Parameshthi-Mahamantra on the five fingers, one achieves complete activation. 'Om Namo Arihantaanam Haam Swaha' on the thumb, 'Om Namo Siddhaanam Hrim Swaha' on the index finger, 'Om Namo Ayariyaanam Ham Swaha' on the middle finger, ... ||65.||

## Yoga Shastra, Eighth Light, Verses 66-75

**Verse 66:** Meditate on the soul, radiant with light, within an eight-petaled lotus. Place the syllables of the mantra, beginning with Om (Om Namo Arihantaanam), on the petals in order.

**Verse 67:** Facing east, begin with the first petal. Recite the eight-syllable mantra (Om Namo Arihantaanam) eleven hundred times.

**Verse 68:** Following the order of the directions, place the mantra on each petal. The yogi should recite this eight-syllable mantra for eight nights to pacify all obstacles.

**Verse 69:** After eight nights have passed, the yogi will see the eight syllables of the mantra on the petals within the lotus.

**Verse 70:**  Fearsome lions, elephants, demons, ghosts, and other obstacles will be pacified by the power of this meditation.

**Verse 71:** Those seeking worldly benefits should meditate on the mantra with Om (Om Namo Arihantaanam). Those seeking liberation should meditate on the mantra without Om (Namo Arihantaanam).

**Verse 72:** Meditate on this mantra (Om Arhanmukha Kamalvasini! Papaatmakshayamkari! Shrutagyan Jwalasahasrajvalite! Saraswati! Matpaapam Han Han Dah Dah Ksham Ksheem Kshu Kshakshah Ksheeradhavale! Amrit Sambhave! Vam Vam Hum Hum Swaha) to pacify the karmic currents. Remember this knowledge, which consumes sin, for the benefit of all beings.

**Verse 73:** This knowledge instantly calms the mind, removes the stain of sin, and illuminates the lamp of knowledge.

**Verse 74:** This knowledge, clearly explained by the wise, such as Vajraswami, is the seed of auspiciousness, extracted from the Vidya Pravad.

**Verse 75:** Having learned this from the guru, meditate on the Siddha Chakra, the calming water that extinguishes the fire of birth and death.

**Meaning:**

* **Saraswati:**  The Jinvani, residing in the lotus of the Arhant's mouth.

## The Eighth Light of Yoga Shastra:

**Verses 76-81**

**Verses 73-75:** The seed of Moksha Lakshmi is considered to be the Siddha Chakra, which is like a new cloud that quenches the fire of birth and death. One should meditate on it for the destruction of karma, knowing it through the teachings of the Guru Maharaj.

**Verse 76:** Meditate on the all-pervading 'A' sound in the navel lotus, the 'Si' sound in the head lotus, the 'A' sound in the mouth lotus, the 'U' sound in the heart lotus, and the 'Sa' sound in the throat lotus.

**Verse 77:** Remember other seed letters that are auspicious in all ways. That other seed letter is 'Namah Sarvasiddhebyah'.

**Verse 78:** One can also meditate on other letters, words, etc., born from the ocean of scriptures, for the attainment of Nirvana.

**Verse 79:** The yogi who is free from attachment and aversion, whatever he contemplates, that is considered meditation. All other elaborate explanations are just that, elaborate.

**Verse 80:** One should analyze the letters and words of mantras and knowledge, step by step, for the attainment of Moksha Lakshmi.

**Verse 81:** Thus, these jewels of truth have been extracted from the ocean of teachings revealed by the great Ganadharas. May they shine brightly in the mirror of the heart of wise men, for the destruction of the accumulated karma and suffering of countless births.

**Conclusion:**

Thus, the Eighth Light of Yoga Shastra, known as the Adhyatma Upanishad, composed by Acharya Shri Hemchandrasuri, with its own explanation, is complete, fulfilling the curiosity of King Shri Kumarapala.

Now the nature of Rupa-Dhyana is described in seven verses. 853. The one who is facing the Lakshmi of Moksha, who has destroyed all karmas, who is four-faced, who gives fearlessness to all beings in all worlds ||1||. 854. The one who is adorned with three shining umbrellas like the moon, whose radiant body outshines the sun ||2||. 855. The one who has the wealth of the kingdom of divine drums, songs, and music, who is adorned with the Asoka tree, which resounds with the buzzing of bees ||3||. 856. The one who is seated on a throne, who is fanned by chamaras, whose toenails shine with the brilliance of the jewels of the crowns of the gods and demons ||4||. 857. The one whose assembly is filled with the abundance of divine flowers, whose sweet teachings are drunk by the herds of deer with their necks raised ||5||. 858. The one who is worshipped by lions, elephants, snakes, and weasels, who have forgotten their natural enmity, who is situated in such an assembly, the one who is full of all perfections, who is illuminated by Kevala Jnana, the Supreme Arhat ||6||. 859. By taking refuge in the form of such an Arhat, the meditation is called Rupa-Dhyana ||7||.

Meaning: The yogi who has reached the face of Moksha Lakshmi, who has destroyed all karmas, who is four-faced, who gives fearlessness to all beings in all worlds, and who is adorned with three shining umbrellas like the moon, whose radiant body outshines the sun, where divine drums are resounding, there is the wealth of the kingdom of songs and music, who is adorned with the Asoka tree, which resounds with the buzzing of bees, who is seated on a throne, who is fanned by chamaras, whose toenails shine with the brilliance of the jewels of the crowns of the gods and demons, whose assembly is filled with the abundance of divine flowers, whose sweet teachings are drunk by the herds of deer with their necks raised, lions, elephants, snakes, and weasels, who have forgotten their natural enmity, who are seated in such an assembly, the one who is full of all perfections, who is illuminated by Kevala Jnana, the Supreme Arhat, by taking refuge in the form of such an Arhat, the meditation is called Rupa-Dhyana. ||1-7||.

Another aspect of Rupa-Dhyana is described in three verses. 860. The one who is free from the stains of attachment, aversion, and great delusion, who is peaceful, beautiful, and charming, who is marked by all auspicious signs ||8||. 861. The one who is adorned with the Yoga Mudra, which is unknown to the Tirthankaras, which is delightful, which pours forth a wonderful, gentle, and blissful stream from the eyes ||9||. 862. The one who meditates on the form of the Jina, with a pure mind, with steady eyes, without blinking, is called a Rupa-Dhyani ||10||.

Meaning: The one who is free from the stains of attachment, aversion, and great delusion, who is peaceful, beautiful, and charming, who is marked by all auspicious signs, who is adorned with the Yoga Mudra, which is unknown to the Tirthankaras, which is delightful, which pours forth a wonderful, gentle, and blissful stream from the eyes, the one who meditates on the form of the Jina, with a pure mind, with steady eyes, without blinking, is called a Rupa-Dhyani. ||8-10||.

Then ||863. The yogi, through the practice of Yoga, has attained the state of being one with the object of meditation, and clearly sees himself as the omniscient being ||11||. ||864. This omniscient Lord is indeed myself, I am He, thus having attained the state of being one with the object of meditation, he considers himself to be the knower of all ||12||.

## The Nature of Rupa-Sthāna Dhyāna

**Yogaśāstra, Eighth Prakāśa, Verses 13-16:**

**Meaning:** By practicing Rupa-Sthāna Dhyāna, the Yogi who attains Tanmayatā (absorption) sees himself clearly as the omniscient. "That omniscient God is undoubtedly me." Thus, by becoming absorbed in the omniscient God, that Yogi is considered omniscient. ||12-13|| How is that? It is said ||865|| "Vītarāga is liberated by contemplating Vītarāga. But by contemplating a Rāgī (passionate), one becomes Rāgī, causing agitation, etc." ||13||

**Meaning:** One who meditates on Śrī Vītarāgadeva becomes Vītarāga himself and is liberated from karmas or desires. But one who contemplates or meditates on kāma (lust), krodha (anger), harṣa (joy), viṣāda (sorrow), raga-dveṣa (attachment-aversion), etc., acquires these faults and becomes Rāgī himself. ||14||

It is also said ||866|| "Whatever the nature of the object with which the instrument-bearer is associated, he attains Tanmayatā in that, just like a crystal." ||14||

**Meaning:** A crystal gem appears to be the color of whatever object is placed near it. Similarly, one's pure soul, like a crystal, becomes absorbed in the nature of whatever object it contemplates. ||15||

Thus, having explained Sadhyāna (right meditation), we now speak of abandoning Asad-Dhyāna (wrong meditation) ||1867|| "One should not practice Asad-Dhyāna, even out of curiosity, because practicing it leads to the destruction of one's soul." ||15||

**Meaning:** Even out of curiosity, one should not practice Asad-Dhyāna if one does not desire it, because practicing it leads to the destruction of one's soul. How is that? ||16|| ||1868|| "All Siddhis (powers) are naturally attained by those who are devoted to liberation. For others, Siddhi is doubtful, but their loss of self-interest is certain." ||16||

**Meaning:** Yogis who are devoted to liberation naturally attain all eight Mahāsiddhis (great powers) and liberation itself. But for those who desire worldly pleasures, the attainment of Siddhi is doubtful, because even if they gain their desired benefit, they will certainly lose their self-interest (by being distracted from the true goal).

Thus, the Naya-Prakāśa, a commentary on the Adhyātmopaṇiṣad, composed by Ācārya Śrī Hemacandrācārya Sūriśvara, in response to the inquiry of the great king Śrī Kumārapāla, is complete.

|| Om Arhate Namah || | 10. Dasham Prakash

Now the nature of Rupaatit Dhyana is being explained. 869. Of the formless, pure consciousness-blissful form, the Supreme Soul. Of the immaculate, the perfected, the meditation is without form. ||1|| _ Meaning: The meditation of the formless (without body), shapeless, pure consciousness-blissful (knowledge-bliss) form, immaculate, perfected Supreme Soul, is called Rupaatit Dhyana. ||1||. 870. Thus constantly remembering, the yogi, with the support of that form. He attains oneness with it, devoid of the object and the perceiver. ||2|| _ Meaning: The yogi who constantly meditates on the form of such an immaculate, shapeless, perfected Supreme Soul, with the support of that form, attains oneness with it, devoid of the object and the perceiver, i.e., the state of being the object and the perceiver. ||2||. 871. Becoming completely surrendered to him, he merges in him thus. In the absence of both the meditator and the meditation, he attains unity with the object of meditation. ||3|| _ Meaning: When the yogi, completely surrendered to that perfected Supreme Soul, becomes absorbed in him; then, in the absence of any support, he becomes one with the soul of the perfected Supreme Soul, and in the absence of both the meditator and the meditation, he becomes one with the object of meditation, the perfected Supreme Soul. ||3||.

The meaning is being explained. 872. This state of being one with the object of meditation, is considered to be unification with it. The soul, in its indivisible form, merges in the Supreme Soul. ||4|| _ Meaning: The unification (oneness) of the mind of the yogi who practices Rupaatit Dhyana with the perfected Supreme Soul, is called Samarasibhava. This is truly considered to be oneness, by which the soul merges in the Supreme Soul in its indivisible form. ||4||. The essence is being explained. 873. From the relationship of the unperceivable and the perceivable, one should contemplate from the gross to the subtle. From the supported to the unsupported, the knower of the truth knows the truth with clarity. ||5|| _ Meaning: One should first enter into the unsupported Rupaatit Dhyana through the meditation with an object, such as the body, the feet, etc. One should contemplate the subtle, subtler objects, such as the Anahata Kala, etc., by grasping the gross objects. And one should go from the supported objects, such as the form, etc., to the unsupported object, the perfected Supreme Soul. If one practices meditation in this order, the yogi who knows the truth attains the truth in a short time. ||5||. The conclusion of the four types of meditation, Pindastha, etc., is being explained. 874. Thus, the mind of the muni, immersed in the nectar of these four types of meditation, Pindastha, Padastha, Rupastha, and Rupaatit. Having realized the truth of the world, he purifies his soul. ||6|| _ Meaning: Thus, the mind of the muni, immersed in the nectar of these four types of meditation, Pindastha, Padastha, Rupastha, and Rupaatit, realizes the truth of the world through experiential knowledge and purifies his soul. ||6||. Having explained the four types of meditation, Pindastha, etc., in order, the difference is being explained through the variations of the same type of meditation.

The types of Dharma Dhyana - 1875. From the contemplation of the command, the result, and the consequences, and the establishment. Thus, Dharma Dhyana is of four types, according to the difference in the object of meditation. ||7||

## The Nature of Rupaatit Dhyana and the Types of Dharma Dhyana

**Yoga Shastra Dasham Prakash Shloka 8 to 11 Meaning:**

1. **Aagna-Vichay:** Contemplation on the Aagna (command)
2. **Apaya-Vichay:** Contemplation on the Apaya (negative consequences)
3. **Vipaak-Vichay:** Contemplation on the Vipaak (results)
4. **Sansthan-Vichay:** Contemplation on the Sansthan (establishment)

These four types of Dharma Dhyana arise from the different aspects of the Dhyeya (object of meditation). || 7 ||

**First, regarding Aagna-Vichay Dhyana, it is said:** 1876.  Where the Aagna (command) of the Sarvjna (omniscient) is considered (relied upon), unhindered by any logic, consistent in its words, unassailable by any other philosophy, that contemplation on the Aagna, which is the twelve-limbed discourse as formulated by the Sarvjna, is called Aagna Dhyana. || 8 ||

**How is the Aagna unhindered?** Let us consider that. 877. The words of the Sarvjna are so subtle that they cannot be refuted by any reason or logic. Therefore, one should accept the Aagna (command) in the form of the words of the Sarvjna. Because the Sarvjna never speaks falsehood. || 9 ||

**Explanation:** The meaning of the inner verses related to this topic is as follows: The words of an Aapta (reliable) person, free from bias, are called Aapta Vachan. They are of two types: First, Aagam Vachan, and second, Hetu-Yukti-Vaad Vachan. Accepting the meaning of words and their meanings from the words themselves is Aagam Vachan. And accepting the truth of things through the similarity or assistance of other proofs, reasons, and logic is called Hetu-Vaad. Both of these are considered to be flawless (equal) because that which has a flawless cause and effect is considered to be proof. Raga (attachment), Dvesha (aversion), Moha (delusion), etc. are called Dosha (faults), and these faults are not present in the Arihant (liberated soul). Therefore, the words of the Arihant are considered to be proof because they are the words of a flawless person.

The Aagam, which is proven by Nay (principles) and Pramaan (proof), free from contradictions, unhindered by any logic, not opposed by any other philosophies or powerful rulers, is like the ocean, the confluence of many rivers in the form of various types of Aagam, Anga, Upanga, Prakirnak, Mool, Chhed, etc. It is adorned with the great wealth of the Maha-Samrajya (great empire) in the form of Ati-Shay-Gyaan (infinite knowledge). It is extremely rare for a Bhavy (soul destined for liberation) to attain it. But it is very easy for the Bhavy soul. It is the Ganipitaka (collection of scriptures) that is always praised and lauded by humans and gods. That Aagam is eternal in its substance and impermanent in its modifications. It reveals the nature of Sat (real) and Asat (unreal) things. Contemplating on the substance based on it, taking the Aagna as the basis, using the Syadvaad-Naya-Yoga (logic of conditionalism), is called Aagna-Vichay Dharma Dhyana. || 9 ||

**Now, regarding Apaya-Vichay Dhyana, it is said:** 878. One should contemplate on the Kshaya (passions) like Raga (attachment), Dvesha (aversion), Krodha (anger), etc., and the negative consequences arising from them, the vices, the suffering, the pain, the bad destinies, etc. This contemplation is called Apaya-Vichay Dharma Dhyana. || 10 ||

**Its fruit is said to be:** 879. The meditator becomes dedicated to avoiding the Apaya (negative consequences) in this world and the next. And from this, he becomes free from all kinds of evil deeds. || 11 ||

**Explanation:** The meaning of the inner verses used in this context is as follows: The one who has not touched the path of Shri-Vitaraag (liberated soul), who has not known the nature of the Supreme Soul, who has not served the Sadhu-Marg (path of the virtuous), the ultimate cause of the path of liberation, that soul faces thousands of kinds of calamities. In the illusion and darkness of this world, whose mind is enslaved, what sin does he not commit? What suffering does he not endure? That is, he commits all sins and endures all kinds of suffering.

## The Nature of Dharma-Dhyana

**Yoga Shastra, Dasham Prakash, Slokas 12-13**

This is the nature of Dharma-Dhyana:

**11.** To contemplate the four states of existence (Deva, Manushya, Tiryanch, Naraka) and their inherent suffering, and to be vigilant against them. This is called Dharma-Dhyana, which is related to the concept of "Apay-Vishaya" (the dangers of the world).

**12.** Contemplating the arising of the fruits of karma, which are constantly emerging, is called "Vipaka-Vishaya" Dharma-Dhyana.

**13.** The same contemplation reveals that the supreme wealth of the Arihant Bhagwan and the extreme misfortunes of the beings in Naraka are both solely due to the power of punya (merit) and papa (demerit) karma. In other words, the strength of punya and papa is the cause of happiness and suffering.

**Explanation:**

The essence of these slokas is this: "Vipaka" refers to the fruits of good and bad karma. These fruits are experienced in various ways, depending on the material and spatial conditions. For example, enjoying sensual pleasures like embracing a woman, tasting delicious food, wearing garlands of flowers, and applying sandalwood are the fruits of good punya karma. On the other hand, experiencing snakes, weapons, fire, and poison are the fruits of bad papa karma. This is the material aspect.

Obtaining heavenly abodes like Saudharma, gardens, forests, palaces, and mansions are the fruits of good punya karma, while experiencing cremation grounds, jungles, emptiness, battlefields, etc., are the fruits of bad papa karma. Experiencing pleasant seasons like spring and autumn, without extreme cold or heat, is the fruit of good punya karma, while experiencing extreme heat, extreme cold, summer, and winter are the fruits of bad papa karma.

A pure mind, contentment, simplicity, and humble behavior are the fruits of good punya karma, while anger, pride, deceit, greed, and violent thoughts are the fruits of bad papa karma. Being born as a high-ranking deva, in a land of sensual pleasures, or as a human being are the fruits of good punya karma, while being born as a Mlechchha (barbarian) like a Bhil, or as a Tiryanch (animal), or in Naraka (hell) are the fruits of bad papa karma.

In this way, karma associated with material, spatial, temporal, mental, and existential conditions undergoes destruction, suppression, or reduction. Thus, karma bound to the material and other aspects of the soul naturally bears its fruits. There are eight types of karma: Jnanavaraniya, Darshanavaraniya, Vedaniya, Mohaniya, Aayushya, Nama, Gotra, and Antaray.

Just as a person with eyes cannot see if a bandage is placed over them, similarly, the soul's all-knowing knowledge is covered by the Jnanavaraniya karma, which acts like a bandage. The five types of knowledge - Mati, Shruta, Avadhi, Manahparyaya, and Kevalgyan - are obstructed by this karma. Darshanavaraniya karma obstructs the five types of sleep and the four types of vision. Just as a gatekeeper prevents someone from seeing their master, similarly, Darshanavaraniya karma prevents the soul from seeing itself. Vedaniya karma is like a honey-coated sword, causing the experience of pleasure and pain. The taste of honey is sweet, but licking it can cut the tongue with the blade, causing pain. Mohaniya karma is like intoxication, which makes the soul confused about right and wrong. It is of two types: Darshanamohiya and Charitramohiya, which suppress right vision and right conduct. Aayushya karma is like a prison, with four types of lifespans: Deva, Manushya, Tiryanch, and Naraka. It is like a chain that keeps each soul in its place. The soul cannot escape from these realms until its lifespan is complete.

## The Nature of Dharma-Dhyana

Dharma-Dhyana is like a picture created by various types of images, as described in the tenth chapter of Yoga Shastra, verses 14 to 19. It gives the being various peculiarities in the body, such as movement, caste, institution, and association. It is like a potter who makes pots to fill with ghee and honey, creating high and low castes. This leads to birth in high and low families. Antarayakarma is like a wicked storekeeper, who prevents the attainment of donations, profits, enjoyment, consumption, semen, etc. Thus, contemplating the various consequences of the eight fundamental natures of karma is called Vipaka-Vichaya Dharma-Dhyana. ||12-13||

Now, the nature of Sansthana-Vichaya Dharma-Dhyana is described. ||882||

The one who contemplates the form of the world, which is beginningless and endless, but has the nature of production, destruction, and sustenance, in terms of substance, field, time, and state, is called Sansthana-Vichaya Dharma-Dhyana. ||14||

Now, the fruit of Lok-Dhyana is described. ||883||

The mind is never attached, and does not become agitated by attachment, aversion, etc., due to the constant change of countless permutations of various substances in the world. ||15||

Explanation: The meaning of the presented inner verses in this context is as follows: We have already described the topic of Sansthana-Vichaya in great detail in the context of the impermanence, etc., contemplation and the contemplation of the world. Therefore, due to the fear of repetition, we do not consider it necessary to describe it in detail here. The question arises: What is the difference between Lok-Bhavana and Sansthana-Vichaya, which makes them distinct? The answer is that Lok-Bhavana is only for contemplation, while in Sansthana-Vichaya, the mind remains stable in the world, etc. This is why it is called Sansthana-Vichaya Dharma-Dhyana. ||15||

Now, the nature and characteristics of Dharma-Dhyana are described. ||884||

In Dharma-Dhyana, there are feelings of destruction, pacification, etc. The word "etc." indicates that there are feelings of pacification and destruction, but not the material form of the auspicious feeling. It is said that "Dharma-Dhyana occurs in those who are unmindful, restrained, pacified in their passions, and have the qualities of a diminished passion." During Dharma-Dhyana, there are three progressively purified Leshyas. They are: Peeta-Leshya (Tejo Leshya), Padma-Leshya, which is more pure than Peeta-Leshya, and Shukla-Leshya, which is even more pure than Padma-Leshya. ||16||

The fruit of the four Dharma-Dhyanas is described. ||885||

When the soul becomes absorbed in Dharma-Dhyana, which is filled with the essence of complete detachment, the being experiences a spiritual bliss that is beyond the senses. It is said that "There is a lack of attachment to objects, health, non-cruelty, gentleness, compassion, good fragrance, and a decrease in urine and feces. The radiance of the body, the cheerfulness of the face, and the gentleness of the voice are signs of the initial fruit of the yogi's practice." ||17||

Now, the otherworldly fruit is described in four verses. ||886||

Those who have renounced attachment, having abandoned their bodies, become the best of the gods in the heavens of Graiveya, etc., through Dharma-Dhyana. ||18||

They attain a body there, adorned with garlands, ornaments, and clothes, which is full of great glory and beauty, and shines like the autumn moon. ||19||

## The Nature of Dharma-Dhyana

**Yoga Shastra, Dasham Prakash, Verses 20-24**

**1888.** Possessing unique vigor (body strength, pure awareness, and the three knowledges), free from the fever of lust, they continuously enjoy unparalleled and lasting happiness. **20.**

**1889.** They enjoy, without hindrance, the nectar of happiness, which is the fulfillment of all desires and captivating to the mind. They are so absorbed in the enjoyment of this unhindered nectar of happiness that they do not know how many births have passed or how much time has elapsed. **21.**

**Meaning:** Yogis who have renounced attachment to all external objects, due to the influence of Dharma-Dhyana, leave their bodies and are born in the celestial realms, such as Graiveyak and other Vaimanik Devalokas, as superior deities. There, they obtain a divine body, radiant like the pure moon of the autumn season, adorned with divine garlands, ornaments, and garments. They are endowed with unique vigor (body strength, pure awareness, and the three knowledges), free from the fever of lust, and continuously enjoy unparalleled and lasting happiness. They receive all kinds of captivating objects as soon as they desire them, and they are so absorbed in the enjoyment of this unhindered nectar of happiness that they do not know how many births have passed or how much time has elapsed. **18-21.**

**890.** After the exhaustion of divine enjoyments, they fall from the celestial realms and are born on earth with a superior body. **22.**

**891.** Born in a divine lineage, they enjoy various pleasures in a continuous and captivating festival. **23.**

**892.** Then, taking refuge in discrimination, they renounce all worldly enjoyments and, through meditation, destroy all karmas and attain the eternal state (Nirvana). **24.**

**Meaning:** After the exhaustion of divine enjoyments, they fall from the celestial realms and are born on earth with a superior body. They are born in a divine lineage, where there are continuous and captivating festivals, and they enjoy various pleasures without attachment. Then, taking refuge in discrimination, they renounce all worldly enjoyments and, through meditation, destroy all karmas and attain the eternal state (Nirvana). **22-24.**

**Thus, the Dasham Prakash, containing the explanation of the Yoga Shastra, along with the commentary of the Khopa-Gnya, written by Acharya Shri Hemchandracharya Suri Shwar, is complete, fulfilling the curiosity of King Shri Kumarapala.**

Now, after concluding the discussion on Dharma Dhyana, we will describe the nature of Shukla Dhyana. ||893||

Dharma Dhyana is said to be the cause of heaven and traditionally the cause of liberation. Now, Shukla Dhyana, the sole cause of liberation, is being described. ||1||

Meaning: We have already described Dharma Dhyana, which is the cause of heaven and traditionally the cause of liberation. Now, we describe the nature of Shukla Dhyana, which is the sole cause of liberation. ||1||

Explanation: There are four types of Shukla Dhyana. Compared to the last two types of Shukla Dhyana, this is an extraordinary cause of liberation, and compared to the first two types, it is the cause of being taken to the Anuttar Vimana. It is said that "one should understand auspicious Astava, Samvara, Nirjara, Vipula Deva Sukha, etc. as the auspicious results of the superior Dharma Dhyana. The result of the first two types of Shukla Dhyana is to experience extraordinary brilliance and radiance, extraordinary happiness, and the pleasure of being an Anuttar Deva, while the result of the last two types is Nirvana-Moksha." ||1||

Now, we will describe the qualifications of the one who is eligible for Shukla Dhyana. ||894||

Only those who have the first Samhanana (Vajra Rishabha Naracha) and are previous scripture holders (Purva Vedins) are capable of doing Shukla Dhyana. The mind of those with low sattva (less virtue) who lack these qualities will not attain stability in Shukla Dhyana in any way. ||2||

Meaning: Only those who have the first Samhanana (Vajra Rishabha Naracha) and are previous scripture holders (Purva Vedins) are capable of doing Shukla Dhyana. The mind of those with low sattva (less virtue) who lack these qualities will not attain stability in Shukla Dhyana in any way. ||2||

Explanation: One who is born first is called Purva, and those who hold or know it are called Purva Vedins. This statement should be understood as a general rule, because even though Mashatush, Marudevi, etc. were not previous scripture holders, their meditation is considered Shukla Dhyana. Due to Sanghayan, etc., there can be lasting stability in meditation, therefore, this is called the main cause. ||2||

Considering this, it is said: ||895||

The mind of those with bodies that are agitated and disturbed by sense objects is not healthy, calm, and stable. Therefore, those with low sattva are not eligible for Shukla Dhyana. ||3||

Meaning: The mind of those with bodies that are agitated and disturbed by sense objects is not healthy, calm, and stable. Therefore, those with low sattva are not eligible for Shukla Dhyana. ||3||

Explanation: It is said that even if someone pierces, cuts, kills, or burns the body of a practitioner of Shukla Dhyana, they will still observe it like a distant spectator. They will not be impatient with the suffering caused by rain, wind, cold, heat, etc. When the soul becomes absorbed in Shukla Dhyana, it does not see anything with its eyes, hear anything with its ears, and does not experience any sensory knowledge like a stone statue. Thus, only those who can maintain stability in their meditation are eligible for Shukla Dhyana, not those with low sattva. Here, there is a doubt: It is said that only those with the first Samhanana are eligible for Shukla Dhyana. In this difficult time, there are only those with the last Sewart Samhanana. In this situation, what is the need to preach Shukla Dhyana now? ||3||

We will address this question here: ||896||

We say that the uninterrupted tradition (Anvashchhitta Amnaya) has come to this point. Even though it is very difficult for modern practitioners to do Shukla Dhyana according to the scriptures, we are describing its nature so that the tradition does not break. ||4||

Meaning: Even though it is very difficult for modern practitioners to do Shukla Dhyana according to the scriptures, we are describing its nature so that the uninterrupted tradition (Anvashchhitta Amnaya) does not break. ||4||

## The Nature of Shukla Dhyana

The eleventh chapter of Yoga Shastra, verses 5 to 7, describe the different types of Shukla Dhyana. 897. There are four types of Shukla Dhyana: 1.  Pruthaktva Vitarka Savichara, 2. Ekatva Vitarka Avichara, 3. Sukshma Kriya Pratipati, and 4. Vyuparat Kriya Nivritti. ||5||

**Meaning:** One should know the four types of Shukla Dhyana: 1.  Thinking about different subjects, 2. Thinking about oneness, 3.  Focusing on subtle actions, and 4.  Stopping gross actions. ||5||

**Explanation:** Here, "Nanaatva" means thinking about various subjects. What subjects? Vitarka, meaning thinking about the twelve angas and fourteen purvas. "Vichara" means moving from one state to another, specifically in four ways: movement of atoms, yanas, etc., sounds, and the three yogas (mind, speech, and body).  ||5||

Now, we will explain the first type in detail. 898.  Thinking about the different aspects of a substance, such as its creation, destruction, and state, according to various nayas, based on previous scriptures. This thinking is connected to one of the three yogas: artha (meaning), vyanjana (sound), or yoga (mind, speech, and body). ||6||

**Explanation:** This is the first type of Shukla Dhyana. For example, while thinking about a substance, one may think about its sound, then return to thinking about the substance, then move from mental yoga to physical yoga or verbal yoga, and vice versa. This type of thinking is the first type of Shukla Dhyana. It is said that "thinking about the different aspects of a substance, such as its creation, state, and destruction, according to various nayas, based on previous scriptures, is Vitarka. And Vichara means moving from one yoga to another, whether it be substance, sound, or one of the three yogas. This is how a Vitraag Muni experiences the first type of Shukla Dhyana, known as Pruthaktva Vitarka Savichara." The question arises: how can the mind remain stable when moving between substance, sound, and the three yogas? And how can this be called Dhyana without mental stability? The answer is: "There is no objection to accepting this as Dhyana because the mind is stable on the subject of the substance." ||6||

Now, we will explain the second type of Shukla Dhyana. 899.  Thinking about a single aspect, according to previous scriptures. This means that the object of meditation is a single aspect, such as an atom, a jiva, a guna like knowledge, or creation, or a single sound, meaning, or one of the three yogas. However, it is not separate. Since there is only one object of meditation, there is no transition. Therefore, this is the second type of Shukla Dhyana, known as Ekatva Vitarka Avichara. ||7||

**Explanation:** It is said that this Dhyana is like a lamp placed in a vacuum, steady and unwavering. Since there is only one object of meditation, there is no transition to other sounds, meanings, aspects, or yogas of the same category. However, the meditation is on a single aspect, such as creation, state, or destruction. There is no transition to other objects of meditation. The meditation is on a single sound, meaning, aspect, or yoga, based on previous scriptures. However, this Dhyana is free from doubt and unwavering. This Dhyana lasts until the end of the twelfth guna sthana. It is characterized by Yathakyata Charitra. ||7||

Now, we will explain the third type of Shukla Dhyana.

## The Nature of Shukla Dhyana

**Yoga Shastra, Eleventh Prakash, Verses 8-12**

**900.** At the time of attaining Nirvana, the Kevali (omniscient) stops the gross yogas of mind, speech, and body. Only the subtle actions like breathing remain. This subtle action never becomes gross; therefore, it is called "Sukhsma-Kriya-A-Pratipati" or Shukla Dhyana. **8.**

**Meaning:** When the time of liberation is very near, the Kevali Bhagwan stops the gross yogas of mind, speech, and body; only the subtle actions like breathing remain. In this, the subtle action never becomes gross; therefore, it is called "Sukhsma-Kriya-A-Pratipati" or Shukla Dhyana. **8.**

In this Dhyana, the soul becomes devoid of Leshya and Yoga, and the soul separates from the body's tendencies. Now, the fourth type called "Vyuparat Kriya Nivarti" is explained. **901.**

**901.** The Kevali Bhagwan, who is as steady as Mount Meru, when in the state of Shaileshikarana, experiences the fourth Shukla Dhyana called "Utsanna Kriya A-Pratipati." This is also called "Vyuparat Kriya A-Nivriti." **9.**

**Meaning:** When the Kevali Bhagwan, who is as steady as Mount Meru, is in the state of Shaileshikarana, the fourth Shukla Dhyana called "Utsanna Kriya A-Pratipati" occurs. This is also called "Vyuparat Kriya A-Nivriti." **9.**

Now, the amount of Yoga in these four types is explained. **902.**

**902.** The first Shukla Dhyana is for the monks who have one Yoga or all three Yogas. The second Dhyana is for the monks who have one Yoga. The third Dhyana is for the Kevalis who have subtle body Yoga, and the fourth Dhyana is only for the A-Yogi Kevalis. **10.**

**Meaning:** The first Shukla Dhyana, called "Prithaktva-Vitarka-Savichara," is for the monks who have studied the Bhaangik Shruta and have one or all three Yogas of mind, speech, and body. The second Dhyana, called "Ekatva-Vitarka-A-Vichara," is for the monks who have one Yoga of mind, speech, or body. This Yoga lacks transition (entry and exit). The third Dhyana, called "Sukhsma Kriya A-Nivriti," involves subtle body Yoga, but not the other Yogas of speech and mind. The fourth Dhyana, called "Vyutsanna Kriya A-Pratipati," occurs in the state of Shaileshikarana for the A-Yogi Kevali who is devoid of Yoga. **10.**

**Explanation:** There are three types of Yoga based on the divisions of mind, speech, and body. In this, the living being with Audarik, Vaikriya, Aharak, Taijas, and Karman bodies has a specific type of Kaya Yoga called "Veerya Parinati-Vishesh." The living being's actions through speech, called "Vachan Yoga," are aided by the Pudgal-Dravya-Samuh (group of matter) acquired through the actions of the Audarik, Vaikriya, and Aharak bodies. Similarly, the living being's actions through mind, called "Mano Yoga," are aided by the Dravya (matter) of the Manovargna acquired through the actions of the Audarik, Vaikriya, and Aharak bodies.

Here, the question arises: "In the last two types of Shukla Dhyana, there is no mind. Since the Kevali Bhagwan is devoid of Mano Yoga, and Dhyana is the stability of the mind, how can it be called Dhyana?" **10.**

This is explained as follows: **903.**

**903.** Just as the stability of the mind of a pseudo-stable seeker is called Dhyana by the knowledgeable, similarly, the stability of the body of the Kevali is also called Dhyana. Just as there is Mano Yoga, similarly, Kaya (body) is also a Yoga. The meaning of Kaya Yoga is also implied by the word "Dhyana." **11.**

**Meaning:** Just as the knowledgeable call the stability of the mind of a pseudo-stable seeker as Dhyana, similarly, they also call the stability of the body of the Kevali as Dhyana. Just as there is Mano Yoga, similarly, Kaya (body) is also a Yoga. The meaning of Kaya Yoga is also implied by the word "Dhyana." **11.**

Here, another question arises: "In the fourth Shukla Dhyana, Kaya Yoga is stopped, so there is no Kaya Yoga in it. Then, how can it be called Dhyana?" This is answered as follows: **904.**

**904.** Due to previous practice, the use of the living being, or the destruction of Karma, or due to the multiplicity of the meaning of the word, or due to the words of the Jina, even the A-Yogi can experience Dhyana. **12.**

**Meaning:** Due to previous practice, the use of the living being, or the destruction of Karma, or due to the multiplicity of the meaning of the word, or due to the words of the Jina, even the A-Yogi can experience Dhyana. **12.**

**Explanation:** Just as the potter's wheel continues to spin due to previous practice even in the absence of the stick and other tools, similarly, even after the cessation of all Yogas of mind, speech, and body, the A-Yogi experiences Dhyana due to previous practice. Although they do not have these Yogas in terms of matter, they still have a good state of mind in the form of the use of the living being. Therefore, it is called the Dhyana of the Yogis. Or, the result of the Dhyana action is the destruction of Karma, and the cause of this is Dhyana. Just as a boy who does not have a son still behaves like a son, similarly, even though the A-Yogi does not have the Yogas of mind, speech, and body, they still experience Dhyana due to previous practice.

## The Nature of Shukla Dhyana

The eleventh chapter of Yoga Shastra, verses 13 to 21, describes the nature of Shukla Dhyana. It is said to be the son of Yoga Shastra, as it leads to the eradication of Bhavopagrahi Karmas, which remain until the end of Bhava (existence). 

Just as the word 'Hari' has multiple meanings, like Sun, Monkey, Horse, Lion, Indra, Krishna, etc., the word 'Dhyana' also has various meanings. It is used to denote contemplation, thought, the cessation of Kaya Yoga, and even the state of being devoid of Yoga. According to grammarians and lexicographers, the combination of Nipata and Upasarga with a root verb can lead to multiple meanings. This is evident in this text. 

Furthermore, the Jinagam also refers to the state of A-yogi, Kevali, and Avastha as Dhyana. It is stated that "Agam-Yukti, with complete faith, is the proof for accepting the existence of A-ti-indriya substances."

Having said this, the four types of Shukla Dhyana are explained in detail:

**13.** The first two types of Shukla Dhyana are primarily related to the meaning of previously heard scriptures, and are practiced by Purva-Dharas and Chhadma-sth-Yogis, who rely on Shruta-gyan (scriptural knowledge). It is important to note that even A-purva-Dharas like Mashatush Muni and Marudevi are considered Shukla Dhyanis.

**14.** The last two types of Shukla Dhyana are devoid of any reliance on external objects. They are practiced by Yogis who have eradicated all their Doshas (faults) and possess pure Kevala-gyan (omniscience) and Kevala-darshan (omniscient vision).

**15-20.** In the first type of Shukla Dhyana, one should start by grasping a particular object from Shruta-gyan, then move on to contemplating its meaning, and then to contemplating the word associated with it. Similarly, one should move from one Yoga to another. The Dhyani (meditator) should transition between meaning, word, and Yoga with great speed, and return to the starting point with the same speed. When the Yogi becomes adept at practicing this intricate process, the qualities of the Atma (soul) manifest, making him eligible for achieving oneness with Shukla Dhyana. When a Yogi, who has mastered one Yoga, meditates on one particular aspect of the cycle of creation, sustenance, and destruction, it is called Ekattva-Avichaar Shukla Dhyana. Just as a Mantrik (one who knows mantras) can use the power of mantras to concentrate the poison present in the entire body at one point, similarly, a Yogi can use the power of Dhyana to focus the mind, which is influenced by the three worlds, on a single atom. Just as a fire with little fuel gets extinguished when the fuel is removed or taken away, similarly, when the mind is deprived of its fuel, which is the object of contemplation, it becomes calm.

**21.** The fruit of the second type of Dhyana is described as follows: When the fire of Dhyana burns intensely, all the Ghatikarma (destructive karmas) of the Yogi are burnt to ashes in an instant.

**Note:** The names of the Ghatikarma are mentioned in the text.

## The Nature of Shukla Dhyana

**Yoga Shastra, Eleventh Prakash, Verses 22-37**

**914.** The knowledge-obscuring, sight-obscuring, and delusion-causing karmas, along with the hindering karmas, are all destroyed simultaneously. **22.**

**Meaning:** The effect of Shukla Dhyana is the simultaneous destruction of the four karmas: knowledge-obscuring, sight-obscuring, delusion-causing, and hindering karmas. **22.**

**915.** This is called the fruit of the destruction of the destructive karmas. **915.**

**23.** Having attained the rare Kevala Jnana and Kevala Darshan, the yogi knows and sees the entire Lok and Alok as it is. **23.**

**Meaning:** After the destruction of the destructive karmas, the yogi, through Dhyana, attains the rare Kevala Jnana and Kevala Darshan, and thus knows and sees the entire Lok and Alok in their true form. **23.**

**916.** After the emergence of Kevala Jnana, the Tirthankara, the Supreme Being, speaks through the extraordinary twenty-four verses. **916.**

**24.** Then that Bhagavan, the omniscient, the all-seeing, the possessor of infinite qualities, wanders the earth, worshipped by gods, demons, humans, and serpents. **24.**

**917.** With the radiance of his speech, he awakens the lotus of the Bhavyas (those destined for liberation). He instantly eradicates the false nature of both substance and state. **25.**

**918.** Just by uttering his name, the suffering born from the endless cycle of existence, which has been going on since time immemorial, is completely destroyed for all Bhavyas. **26.**

**919.** Even crores of gods, humans, and others who come to worship him, are contained within a space of just one yojana due to his influence. **27.**

**920.** Gods, humans, animals, and others understand his words, which convey the teachings of Dharma, in their own respective languages. **28.**

**921.** Hundreds of severe diseases are pacified by his influence, just as the heat of the earth is calmed by the rising moon. **29.**

**922.** Epidemics, famine, excessive rain, drought, war, and enmity do not exist where he resides, just as darkness disappears with the thousand rays of the sun. **30.**

**Meaning:** After attaining Kevala Jnana, the Arhant Bhagavan, the supreme among gods, omniscient, all-seeing, and a repository of infinite qualities, wanders the earth, worshipped by numerous gods, demons, serpent-kings, and others. While wandering, Bhagavan, through his speech, which is like the moonlight, awakens the Bhavyas, who are like blooming lotuses. He instantly eradicates the darkness of their false nature, both in substance and state. Just by uttering his name, the suffering of all Bhavyas, born from the endless cycle of existence since time immemorial, is destroyed forever. And those who come to worship him, crores of gods, humans, and animals, are contained within a space of just one yojana due to his influence. They understand his words, which convey the teachings of Dharma, in their own respective languages. They understand it as if he is speaking in their own language. Wherever Bhagavan wanders, in that area, for hundreds of yojanas in all directions, his influence pacifies all major diseases, just as the heat of the earth is calmed by the rising moon. Just as darkness disappears with the rising sun, similarly, wherever Bhagavan resides, there are no epidemics, famine, excessive rain, drought, war, or enmity. **24-30.**

**923.** Around him, a radiant sphere, like the sun, appears, illuminating all directions. **31.**

**924.** The gods, who are devoted to the auspicious, cause the blooming lotuses to dance, swaying them with their hands. **32.**

**925.** The wind blows favorably, birds circle him, trees bow down, and even thorns turn their heads downwards. **33.**

**926.** The Ashoka tree, with its red leaves and fragrant flowers, seems to be praising him with the buzzing of bees, like a natural hymn. **34.**

**927.** All six seasons simultaneously attend upon him, as if to perform penance, with the help of Cupid. **35.**

**928.** A thunderous drum resounds in the sky before him, announcing, as it were, the auspicious journey to Nirvana. **36.**

**929.** All five senses become instantly delightful in his presence. Who does not attain the highest excellence of qualities, when they are in the presence of such great beings? **37.**

## The Form of the White Meditation

**Yoga Shastra, Eleventh Light, Verses 30-47**

||930. Even though their nails and hair naturally grow, they do not grow, having seen the destruction of karma accumulated over hundreds of births, they are afraid. ||38||

||931. The gods pacify the dust with showers of fragrant water, and they make the earth fragrant with showers of blooming flowers. ||39||

||932. The three umbrellas, purified by the devotion of the gods, are held in a circular manner above the Lord, like the three sources of the Ganges River. ||40||

**Meaning:** A radiant halo, surpassing even the brilliance of the sun, appears around the body of the Tirthankara Bhagwan, illuminating all directions. When Bhagwan walks on earth, the benevolent, devotional gods immediately establish golden lotuses at each place where his feet touch the ground. The wind blows favorably. Birds circle Bhagwan from the right. Trees bend down, and the thorns on them point downwards. The fragrant Ashok tree, adorned with red leaves and blooming flowers, seems to naturally praise Bhagwan with the buzzing of bees, and it stands majestically, casting its shade upon him. As if atoning for their sins in aiding Kamadeva, all six seasons appear together near the Lord. At that time, the divine drums resound in the sky, announcing the auspicious journey of Bhagwan's imminent Nirvana. In Bhagwan's presence, even the objects of the five senses become pleasing in an instant, for whose qualities do not increase in the company of great souls? Everyone's qualities increase. Hair, nails, etc., have the nature to grow, but seeing the destruction of karma accumulated over hundreds of births, they are afraid and do not dare to grow. The gods pacify the dust with showers of fragrant water, and they make the earth fragrant with showers of blooming flowers. The Indra, with devotion, hold three umbrellas in a circular manner above the Lord, as if they were holding the three circular sources of the Ganges River. ||31-40||

||933. To declare, "This is our only Lord," Indra raises his finger high, and a jeweled banner adorns the front of Bhagwan. ||41||

||934. Beautiful, white fly whisks, like the radiance of the autumn moon, are waved over him. When they reach his lotus face, they create an illusion like that of royal swans. ||42||

||935. Three high walls surround him, shining brightly, as if the right knowledge, vision, and conduct have taken three forms. ||43||

||936. Wishing to bestow grace upon the people of the four directions simultaneously, Bhagwan has four bodies and four faces, as if he has taken four forms in the four directions to benefit everyone. ||44||

||937. When the gods, demons, humans, and serpent gods bow down at his feet, Bhagwan, seated on his throne, appears like the sun shining on the peak of the eastern mountain. ||45||

||938. At that time, the Dharmachakra, the symbol of the universal sovereignty of the three worlds, stands before him, illuminated by the radiance of his effulgent form, which spreads light in all directions. ||46||

||939. The lords of the worlds, the lords of the celestial chariots, the lords of the lights, and the lords of the forests, all stand in the assembly, their number exceeding a hundred million. ||47||

**Meaning:** To declare, "This is our only Lord," Indra raises his finger high, and a jeweled banner adorns the front of Bhagwan. Beautiful, white fly whisks, like the radiance of the autumn moon, are waved over him. When they reach his lotus face, they create an illusion like that of royal swans. The three high walls surrounding him, shining brightly, appear as if the right knowledge, vision, and conduct have taken three forms. When Bhagwan sits in the assembly to preach Dharma to the people of the four directions, he has four bodies and four faces, as if he has taken four forms in the four directions to benefit everyone. When the gods, demons, humans, and serpent gods bow down at his feet, Bhagwan, seated on his throne, appears like the sun shining on the peak of the eastern mountain. At that time, the Dharmachakra, the symbol of the universal sovereignty of the three worlds, stands before him, illuminated by the radiance of his effulgent form, which spreads light in all directions.

Thus, the nature of the extraordinary qualities of the Kevala Jnani Tirthankara has been explained. Now, the nature of ordinary Kevalis will be explained. ||40||

Those who do not have the Tirthankara Nama Karma, they too attain Kevala Jnana through the power of Yoga. ||48||

**Meaning:** Those who do not have the Tirthankara Nama Karma, they too attain Kevala Jnana through the power of Yoga. If their Ayu Karma remains, they preach Dharma to the beings of the world. If their Ayu Karma does not remain, they attain Nirvana. ||4||

After this, the Uttar Kriya is described. ||41||

Having attained Kevala Jnana and Kevala Darshan, when a Yogi has only a few Muhurtas of life remaining, he quickly begins the third Shukla Dhyana, called Sukshma Kriya Apratipati. ||49||

**Meaning:** Having attained Kevala Jnana and Kevala Darshan, when a Yogi has only a few Muhurtas of life remaining, he quickly begins the third Shukla Dhyana, called Sukshma Kriya Apratipati. ||49||

The word "Hurt" means the time within a Muhurta. Do all Yogis begin the third Dhyana in the same way, or is there some difference? This is explained. ||42||

If the other Karmas, such as Nama, Gotra, and Vedaniya Karmas, are more than the Ayu Karma, then the Yogi performs a Samudghata to equalize them. ||50||

**Meaning:** If the other Karmas, such as Nama, Gotra, and Vedaniya Karmas, are more than the Ayu Karma, then the Yogi performs a Samudghata to equalize them. ||50||

**Explanation:** If the amount of Ayu Karma is equal to the amount of remaining Karma, then the third Dhyana is begun. But if the amount of other Karmas is more than the Ayu Karma, then a special effort called Samudghata is made to equalize the situation, such as through Sthitighata, Rasaghata, etc. It is said, "If the other Karmas of the Kevali Bhagwan are more than the Ayu Karma, then they perform an effort called Kevali Samudghata with the desire to equalize them." Samudghata means to strike with such force that the desired result is achieved in one go, and it does not happen again. It means to expel the Atma Pradesh from the body. ||50||

The method of Samudghata is explained further. ||43||

The Yogi creates a Danda, Kapata, and Manthani in three periods of time, and in the fourth period, he fills the entire Lok with his Atma Pradesh. ||51||

**Meaning:** The Yogi creates a Danda, Kapata, and Manthani in three periods of time, and in the fourth period, he fills the entire Lok with his Atma Pradesh. ||51||

**Explanation:** The Dhyana-sth Kevali Bhagwan, through the power of Dhyana, expels his Atma Pradesh from his body. In the first period, he expels his Atma Pradesh from his body and extends them upwards and downwards to the Lokanta, making them the size of the Lok. In the second period, he creates a Kapata-like shape from that Danda-shaped form. This means that he extends his Atma Pradesh forward and backward in the Lok, so that they become like a Kapata in the East-West or North-South direction. In the third period, he extends that Kapata into the shape of a Manthani. This fills most of the Lok. In the fourth period, the Yogi fills the gaps (empty spaces) and becomes pervasive in all fourteen Rajulokas. In this way, as he moves towards the Anushreni, his Atma Pradesh also fills the corners of the Lok. This means that in four periods, he fills the entire Lokakasha with his Atma Pradesh. As many Atma Pradesh there are, so many Lokakasha Pradesh become. Therefore, one Atma Pradesh becomes pervasive in each Lokakasha Pradesh. This is called "Lokpurna." Hearing this, it becomes consistent with the views of other philosophers who believe that the Atma is Vibhu, i.e., all-pervasive. This means...

## The Nature of Shukla Dhyana

**Yoga Shastra, Eleventh Prakash, Verses 52-55**

| Other philosophies have considered the soul to be all-seeing, all-faced, all-armed, and all-footed, pervading all the realms. || 51 ||

Now, what do they do in the fifth and subsequent times? It is said:

| 944.  **Samayaistataścaturbhiḥ nivartate lokapūraṇād asmāt | Vihitāyuḥ samakarmā, dhyānī pratileṇamārgeṇa || 52 ||**

**Meaning:** By pervading the realms with the soul's regions in four times, making other karmas equal to āyus karma, the meditating muni gathers the work of filling the realms in reverse order. || 52 ||

**Explanation:** In this way, by making āyus karma equal to the state of other karmas in four times, in the fifth time, they gather and shrink the soul's regions filled with karma in the realms. In the sixth time, they gather the form of the manthani, in the seventh time, they shrink the form of the kapāta, and in the eighth time, they gather the form of the danda, and become situated in their original body as before. At the time of samudghāta, there is no activity of the yoga of mind and speech. At that time, there is no purpose of these two yogas, only the activity of kāya-yoga. In it, in the first and eighth times, there is predominance of audārika kāya, so there is audārika kāya yoga. In the second, sixth, and seventh times, due to the soul's movement outside the audārika body, there is excessive vibration of kārmāṇa-vīrya, so there is audārika-kārmāṇa-miśra yoga. In the third, fourth, and fifth times, the soul's regions are without the activity of the audārika body and outside that body, so there is only kārmāṇa kāya yoga without the help of that body. The learned scholar, Shri Umāsvāti, has said in the 275th and 276th verses of Praśamarati: "In the time of samudghāta, in the first and eighth, there is yoga of the audārika body, in the seventh, sixth, and second, there is mixed audārika yoga, and in the fourth, fifth, and third, there is kārmāṇa body-yoga, and in these three times, they are regularly anāhārakas." After abandoning samudghāta, if necessary, they engage in the activity of all three yogas. For example, if someone asks a question with an unanswerable mind, they engage in the tendency of satya or asatyāmṛṣā manoyoga. Similarly, in addressing someone, etc., they engage in the activity of vachanayoga. They do not engage in the activity of the other two types of yoga. Both also engage in the activity of returning the fruits of audārika kāya yoga, etc. After that, they begin yoga-nirodha in the time of antarmūhūrta. There are two divisions of these three yogas: sūkshma and bādara. After becoming only-knowing, the after-time of these two types of yogas is negligible antarmūhūrta, and the excellent one is up to a little less than the previous time. The sayogi-kevali wanders and awakens many bhavya jivas. When their lifespan is only antarmūhūrta remaining, they first stop bādara vachanayoga and manoyoga with bādara kāya yoga, then they stop bādara kāya yoga with sūkshma kāya yoga. When bādara kāya yoga is happening, it is impossible to stop sūkshma yoga. A running man cannot suddenly stop his speed, he can only stop gradually. Similarly, after stopping all bādara yoga, they stop sūkshma vachan and manoyoga with sūkshma kāya yoga, then they stop sūkshma kāya yoga with their own soul, doing sūkshma kriyā anivarti shukla dhyāna. || 52 || This same thing is said in three verses.

| 945. **Śrīmān cintyavīryaḥ śarīrayoge 'tha bādare sthitvā | Acirad eva hi nirunadḍhi, bādaro vāṅmanaḥ - sayogau || 53 ||**

| 946. **Sūkṣmeṇa kāyayogena, kāyayogam sa bādaraṁ rūṇḍhyāt | Tasmin aniruddhe sati śakyo roddhum na sūkṣmatanu yogaḥ || 54 ||**

| 947. **Vachan - manoyoga - yugaṁ sūkṣmaṁ nirunadḍhi sūkṣmāt tanuyogāt | Vidadhāti tato dhyānaṁ sūkṣmakriyām asūkṣmatanu yogaṁ || 55 ||**

**Meaning:** Possessing the wealth of kevalajnāna, etc., and inconceivable power, that yogi, taking hold of bādara kāya yoga, quickly stops bādara vachanayoga and manoyoga, then stops bādara kāya yoga with sūkshma kāya yoga; because without stopping bādara kāya yoga, sūkshma kāya yoga cannot be stopped. After that, they stop sūkshma vachan and sūkshma manoyoga with sūkshma kāya yoga. After that, they do sūkshma kriyā asūkṣmatanu yoga, meditating. || 55 ||

## The Nature of Shukla Dhyana

**Yoga Shastra, Eleventh Prakash, Verses 56-61**

The meditation called "Sookshma Kriya Nivarti" is devoid of Sookshma Kaya Yoga. This is also known as "Samuccchinn Kriya." ||53-55|| ||948||

After this, the fourth Shukla Dhyana, called "Samuccchinn Kriya," manifests for the A-yogi who becomes a Kevali. This stops all actions. At the end of this, the four Aghatikarma are destroyed. ||56|| ||949||

After that, attaining the state of "Shaileshi" (immovable like Mount Meru) for the time it takes to pronounce the five short vowels "a, i, u, ri, lu," the soul simultaneously destroys the Vedaniya, Ayu, Nama, and Gotra Karmas from their roots. ||57|| ||950||

Then, abandoning the Audarik, Taijas, and Karman bodies, which are the root causes of the cycle of birth and death, the soul, devoid of any physical form, reaches the end of the universe (Lokant) in the Siddha Kshetra in a single moment, without touching any other space. ||58||

It is said, "After abandoning the final body on this earth, the soul goes there and attains Siddhi." Here, the question arises, "Why doesn't the soul go beyond Lokant while ascending? Or, after abandoning the body, why doesn't it go down or sideways?" The answer is: ||951||

The Siddha soul does not go above Lokant into the Aloka Akash, because just as water is the medium for the movement of fish, similarly, Dharma Astikaya Dravya is the medium for the movement of the soul. Since it is not present above Lokant, the soul cannot go further. Also, the soul does not go down, because it has no gravity. And due to the absence of Kayadi Yoga and its influence, it does not go sideways either. ||59||

Here, the question arises, "Since the soul is bound by the limits of space for its upward journey after being liberated from Karma, shouldn't it be immobile?" The answer is: ||952||

Due to the lightness (Laghava Yoga) of the Siddha soul, it ascends like smoke, and due to the absence of attachment, it goes only upwards. Just as a gourd with eight layers of mud attached to it sinks in water due to its weight, but as the mud layers are gradually removed by the water, the gourd becomes lighter and naturally floats to the surface; similarly, the soul, freed from the layers of Karma, naturally reaches Lokant. Just as a castor seed, freed from its shell, goes upwards, similarly, the Siddha soul, freed from the bondage of Karma, ascends. ||60|| ||953||

Attaining the infinite, unparalleled, uninterrupted, and naturally arising bliss of the soul, which is full of joy, the liberated soul, endowed with Kevala Jnana and Kevala Darshan, rejoices in it. ||61||

**Explanation:**

"Sadik" means "with beginning." This bliss has never been experienced before in the cycle of birth and death.

## The Nature of Pure Awareness

**Yoga Shastra, Eleventh Light, Verse 61**

Therefore, that bliss is eternal. Since this perfected bliss never ends, it is infinite bliss. How can the eternal be infinite? Because by seeing the destruction of pots, etc., we know that pots, etc., have a beginning. We see that they are destroyed by the actions of hammers, etc. Therefore, since a pot is produced from its destruction, it is not called infinite. But since the soul never perishes, that bliss is imperishable and infinite. 

Unparalleled, meaning devoid of any comparison, bliss. Even if you gather together all the worldly bliss of all living beings in the past, present, and future, that bliss is still an infinitesimal part of the bliss of a perfected being. There is no obstruction of any kind in their bliss. It is free from the pain of body and mind, so it is unobstructed. The bliss of a perfected being, which arises naturally, is the bliss that arises only from the nature of the soul. 

Thus, liberated souls, who are endowed with perfect knowledge and perfect vision, are the possessors of infinite, unparalleled, unobstructed, and natural bliss. By saying this, the author has refuted the views of many philosophers who say that "liberated souls are devoid of bliss and other qualities, and are devoid of knowledge and vision." 

The Vaisheshika philosophers say that "the complete destruction of the nine special qualities of the soul, such as intellect, is liberation," or those who consider liberation to be merely the absence of existence, like the extinction of a lamp, their views have also been refuted! It is not appropriate to desire liberation as the destruction of qualities, or as the destruction of the soul. What wise and intelligent person would desire liberation as the destruction of their qualities, or as the destruction of the soul? Therefore, liberation, which is proven by all evidence, and which is of the nature of infinite knowledge, vision, bliss, and energy, is the only appropriate path. 

**61**

Thus, the Eleventh Light of the Yoga Shastra, a bound manuscript named Adhyatma Upanishad, composed by Acharya Shri Hemchandrasuri, is complete, along with its detailed explanation, in response to the curiosity of King Kumarapala.

| ॐ Arhate Namah ||
|12. Dvaṭaṇam Prakāśa
The scripture begins by saying, "I will also speak from my own experience." To explain this in detail, we offer the following introduction:
1954. Śrutisiṁdhoḥ guru mukhato, yadadhigatam tadiha darśitam samyak. Anubhavasiiddhamidaani, prakāśyate tattvamidam amalām. ||1||
Meaning: - I have explained correctly what I have learned from the ocean of scriptural knowledge and from the mouth of the guru.
- Now I will reveal the pure truth of yoga, which is proven by my own experience. ||1|| Now, to ascend to the highest state, we will describe the four types of mind. 955. Iha vikṣiptam yaatayaatam śliṣṭam tatha suliinam ca. Cetasca tuḥprakaaram tajjña-camatkaarakari bhavet ||2||
Meaning: - There are four types of mind in the realm of yoga practice: 1. Vikṣipta mind, 2. Yaatayaata mind, 3. Śliṣṭa mind, and 4. Suliina mind. These four types of mind are wondrous for those who know this subject.
We will explain them in order. 956. Vikṣiptam calam iṣṭam, yaatayaatam ca kim api saananadam. Prathamaabhyaase dvayam api, vikalpa viṣayagraham tat syāt ||3|| Meaning: - The vikṣipta mind is restless, it wanders here and there. The yaatayaata mind is somewhat pleasurable;
it sometimes goes out and sometimes remains inside. These two states of mind are found in those who are practicing for the first time. That is, at first the mind is restless, then with practice, stability gradually begins to come along with the restlessness. Both types of these minds are also receptive to external objects with choice. ||3|| ||957. Śliṣṭam sthira saananadam, suliinam ati niścalam paraananadam. Tanmaatraka viṣayagraham ubhayam api budhaistadaamnatam ||4|| Meaning: - The third mind, called śliṣṭa, is stable and joyful, and when that same mind becomes extremely stable, it becomes supremely joyful; that is the fourth mind, called suliina. Both of these minds only receive their own appropriate objects. But they do not receive external objects. Therefore, the wise have considered their qualities according to their names. ||4|| ||958. Evam kramaśo'bhyaasaaveshaad dhyaanaṁ bhajet niraalamBam. Samarasabhaavam yaatah paramaanandam tato'nubhavet. ||5|| Meaning: - In this way, one should practice gradually, from the vikṣipta to the yaatayaata mind, from the yaatayaata to the śliṣṭa, and from the śliṣṭa to the suliina mind. By practicing repeatedly in this way, the meditator reaches niraalamBa dhyaan. This leads to samarasabhaava, and then the yogi experiences supreme bliss. ||5|| How is samarasabhaava attained? It is said: 959. Baahyaatmaanam apaasya, prasattibhaaja'antaraatmana yogi. Satatam paramaatmaanam vicintayet tanmayatvaaya. ||6|| Meaning: - The yogi who desires the bliss of the Self should abandon the external self, the state of being external to the Self, and constantly meditate on the Supreme Self in order to become one with it. Two verses describe the nature of the external self, etc.

## Description of Experienced Yoga

**Yoga Shastra, Twelfth Light, Verses 7 to 14**

**960.** The one who perceives the body, wealth, family, wife, children, etc., with the perspective of "mine" is called the **Bhiratma** (external self). But the body is just a place for me to reside (a house), I am the resident owner. This body is just a rented house for living. Thus, the **AntarAtma** (internal self) is one who does not experience joy or sorrow in the association and disassociation of **Pudgala** (matter) in the form of pleasure and pain.

**961.** The **Atma** (soul) is of the nature of **Chidananda** (blissful consciousness), devoid of all external limitations, pure like crystal, imperceptible to the senses, and possessing infinite qualities. The wise call it **Paramatma** (Supreme Soul).

**Meaning:** The body, wealth, family, wife, children, etc., are perceived with the perspective of "mine" by the **Bhiratma**. However, the body is merely a dwelling place, and I am the resident. This body is like a rented house. Thus, the **AntarAtma** remains unaffected by the association and disassociation of **Pudgala** in the form of pleasure and pain. The **Atma** is of the nature of **Chidananda**, free from all external limitations, pure like crystal, imperceptible to the senses, and possesses infinite qualities. The wise call it **Paramatma**.

**962.** One should always know the **Atma** as distinct from the body and the body as always distinct from the **Atma**. The **Yogin** who knows the difference between the two will not be confused in the realization of the **Atma**.

**Meaning:** The **Atma** should be known as distinct from the body, and the body should always be known as distinct from the **Atma**. The **Yogin** who understands this difference will not be confused in the realization of the **Atma**.

**963.** The **Muda** (ignorant) whose inner light is covered by karma finds satisfaction in things other than the **Atma**. But the **Jnani** (knowledgeable) who has overcome the delusion of happiness in external objects finds satisfaction only in the **Atma**.

**Meaning:** The **Muda** whose inner light is covered by karma finds satisfaction in things other than the **Atma**. But the **Jnani** who has overcome the delusion of happiness in external objects finds satisfaction only in the **Atma**.

**964.** The state of **Nirvana** is certainly attainable without effort for those who are knowledgeable and seek only the knowledge of the **Atma** within themselves.

**Meaning:** The state of **Nirvana** is certainly attainable without effort for those who are knowledgeable and seek only the knowledge of the **Atma** within themselves.

**965.** Just as iron becomes gold by the touch of the **Siddh Rasa** (the essence of perfection), so too the **Atma** becomes **Paramatma** by the contemplation of the **Atma**.

**Meaning:** Just as iron becomes gold by the touch of the **Siddh Rasa**, so too the **Atma** becomes **Paramatma** by the contemplation of the **Atma**.

**966.** The truth shines forth spontaneously due to the impressions of past lives, just as a person who wakes up from sleep remembers past experiences without anyone telling them.

**Meaning:** The truth shines forth spontaneously due to the impressions of past lives, just as a person who wakes up from sleep remembers past experiences without anyone telling them.

**967.** Or, the truth shines forth in this very life due to the grace of the **Guru**. This happens to the pure-minded devotee who is devoted to the **Guru's** feet and is filled with the essence of peace.

**Meaning:** Or, the truth shines forth in this very life due to the grace of the **Guru**. This happens to the pure-minded devotee who is devoted to the **Guru's** feet and is filled with the essence of peace.

**Both births emphasize the need for the **Guru's** guidance.**

## Description of Experienced Yoga

**Yoga Shastra, Twelfth Light, Verses 15-25**

**Meaning:**

**15.** The Guru is the teacher of the first knowledge of the Truth in the previous birth, and in the next birth, the Guru is the one who reveals the knowledge of the Truth. Therefore, one should always serve and attend to the Guru Maharaj.

**16.** Just as the sun illuminates an object situated in dense darkness, so too, the Guru illuminates the soul, lost in the darkness of ignorance, with the light of knowledge in this world (by giving the true teachings).

**17.** Therefore, having abandoned the afflictions like Pranayama, etc., the Yogi, having received the teachings of the Guru, should be devoted to the practice of the Self.

**18.** The Yogi should diligently abandon the restlessness of speech, mind, and body, and should always keep the Self steady and calm like a vessel filled with nectar.

**19.** The Yogi, who is devoted to indifference, should not think about anything at all, so that the mind does not become agitated by thoughts and desires and does not attain stability.

**20.** As long as there is even a little effort, as long as there is any thought or imagination, there will be no attainment of absorption (Tन्मयता); what to speak of the attainment of the Truth?

**21.** Even the Guru cannot directly say, "This is that Supreme Truth." For the Yogi who is absorbed in indifference, that Supreme Truth shines forth by itself.

**22-25.** When the body becomes absorbed in the Supreme Truth due to indifference, a state of ecstasy (उन्मनीभाव) manifests. This is explained in four verses:

**22.** Sitting comfortably in a secluded, extremely pure, and beautiful place, with all the limbs relaxed from the tip of the toes to the top of the head,

**23.** Even while seeing a beautiful form, hearing a sweet and pleasing voice, smelling fragrant substances, and enjoying delicious flavors,

**24.** Even while touching soft objects and restraining the activities of the mind, the Yogi, who is absorbed in calculated indifference, is always free from the delusion of objects.

**25.** The Yogi, who is free from thoughts and actions both inside and outside, attains absorption in the Supreme Truth and experiences a great state of ecstasy.

## Description of Experienced Yoga

**Chapter 12, Verses 26-35**

Even without stopping the activities of the mind, the yogi, filled with indifference (nirmamtavabhav), devoid of constant attachment to objects, and free from all external and internal anxieties and efforts, becomes absorbed in the object of meditation and attains a state of extreme bliss. ||22-25||

Now, the purpose of not restraining the senses is explained. ||979||

The senses receive their respective objects. Do not restrain them, nor should you make them engage in objects. By doing so, the knowledge of the truth is revealed in a short time. ||26||

In the Vitaragastotra, we have said, "O Lord! You have not restrained the senses, nor have you left them free; but you have conquered the senses with indifference." ||26||

The following two verses explain how to conquer the mind. ||980||

Wherever the mind wanders, do not forcibly restrain it from there. For, the restrained mind becomes more agitated, while the unrestrained mind attains peace. ||27||

Just as a maddened elephant, when forcibly restrained, becomes more frenzied, but when left unrestrained, becomes calm after obtaining its desired objects, so too, the mind becomes calm by obtaining its desired objects. ||28||

The following two verses explain how to stabilize the mind. ||982||

Just as the yogi's restless mind becomes steady in a particular place and by a particular means, so too, it should not be moved in the least from that place and by that means. By practicing this method of mind control, even the most restless mind becomes steady, like a stick placed on the tip of a finger. ||29-30||

Now, the following two verses explain the means of conquering the senses. ||984||

First, the sight goes out and merges into some place. Then, having attained stability there, it gradually dissolves, i.e., retreats. Thus, the sight, spread everywhere and gradually withdrawn from there, becomes steady in the pure mirror of the supreme truth and sees the Self with the Self. ||31-32||

Now, the following three verses explain the method of conquering the mind. ||986||

The yogi, constantly immersed in indifference, free from all effort, and cultivating the feeling of supreme bliss, does not engage the mind anywhere. When the Self neglects the mind, it does not take refuge in the senses. That is, the mind does not then impel the senses towards objects. The senses also do not engage in their respective objects. ||33-34||

Neither the Self impels the mind, nor does the mind impel the senses. When both are abandoned, they automatically perish. ||35||

## Yoga Shastra, Twelfth Light, Verses 36-42

**The Description of Experienced Yoga**

**Verse 36:**
When the cause-and-effect relationship of the mind is destroyed on all sides, meaning when it becomes calm like fire covered in ash, and all its activities like worry, memory, etc., are destroyed like the flow of water, then the soul, like a lamp placed in a windless place, reveals its true nature free from the impurities of karma.

**Verse 37:**
**The Identification of True Knowledge**
When true knowledge manifests, the body becomes soft even without sweating or massage, and it becomes oily without any oil application. This is a sign of the manifestation of true knowledge.

**Verse 38:**
**The Second Sign**
When the mental affliction is destroyed by the arising of a mind-free state, the body of the true knower becomes relaxed like an umbrella that has lost its stiffness.

**Verse 39:**
The only medicine to remove the affliction of the inner being, which constantly causes suffering, is the mind-free state.

**Verse 40:**
**The Fruit of the Mind-Free State**
Ignorance is like a banana plant, the fickle senses are its leaves, and the mind is its root. Just as the banana plant is destroyed when its fruit appears, because it will not bear fruit again, so too, when the fruit of the mind-free state appears, ignorance is completely destroyed, and no further karma is accumulated.

**Verse 41:**
**The Mind-Free State is the Key to Conquering the Mind**
The mind is extremely fickle, subtle, and fast, making it very difficult to control. Therefore, without giving the mind rest, one should pierce it with the arrow of the mind-free state, without any negligence.

**Verse 42:**
**The Fruit of the Mind-Free State for Yogis**
When the mind-free state arises, the yogi experiences his body as if it were dissolved, like mercury, like a lump of butter, like a piece of cloth, or like water. He then recognizes the false nature of his thoughts.

## Description of Experienced Yoga

**Yoga Shastra, Twelfth Light, Verses 43-52**

**42.** Scattered, burnt to ashes, flown away, melted, and the body is not one's own (Asatkalapa).

**43.** Freed from the serpents of intoxicated senses, the yogi, immersed in the new nectar-pond of unmanliness, experiences the unparalleled and excellent taste of the nectar of truth.

**44.** When unmanliness is attained, even without the practice sequence of exhalation, inhalation, retention, and postures, the wind naturally disappears by itself with sincere effort.

**45.** The wind that cannot be held even with long and repeated efforts, is immediately stabilized by the yogi when unmanliness is attained.

**46.** When there is stability in the practice of this unmanliness, and when the pure (free from the web of karma) undivided knowledge of truth arises, the yogi appears like a liberated person, with the complete eradication of breath.

**47.** In the waking state, the yogi, established in his own nature (Atma-swaroop), remains steady like a sleeping person in the state of absorption (laya). Being devoid of breath in the state of absorption, he is not at all inferior to the liberated soul; rather, he is like a Siddha.

**48.** People dwelling on this earth always experience the states of waking and dreaming, but the knower of truth, immersed in absorption, neither wakes nor sleeps.

**49.** In the dream state, there is certainly emptiness, and in the waking state, the yogi perceives the objects of the senses. But after attaining the truth, he transcends both these states and remains established in the blissful state of absorption (laya).

**50.** Actions are for sorrow, that is, the cause of sorrow is the actions performed by oneself, and being actionless is for happiness. If you know this truth, why don't you strive to attain actionlessness for the easy path of liberation?

**51.** Whether there is liberation or not, the supreme bliss is experienced here directly through meditation. When this supreme bliss is attained, all the pleasures of the world appear as insignificant as grass.

**52.** Honey is not sweet, nor are these pleasures, but the frost-like nectar is truly sweet. The name of nectar is given to this, but its fruit is false nectar. Therefore, give up this striving and be happy, friend! This fruit of the mind, without any defect, is yours when you attain grace.

## Description of Experienced Yoga - Conclusion

**Verse 53-55 of the Twelfth Chapter of Yoga Shastra:**

**Meaning:** In the face of the fruit of Uन्मनीभाव (state of being free from the mind), honey does not seem sweet, the moon's radiance does not appear cool, nectar remains only in name, and the fruit of nectar becomes fruitless. Therefore, O friend of the mind! Stop striving for efforts that bring pain in the end. Now be happy with me, because the attainment of the unbroken fruit of supreme bliss depends on your happiness. ||52||

The Guru, who teaches about Uन्मनीभाव through self-experience, is praised through the expression of Vyatireka-bhava (contrasting feeling). 1006.

**Meaning:** As long as the state of mind exists, objects like tigers, which cause aversion, and objects like women, which cause attraction, are perceived by the mind as causing pain and pleasure, even when they are far away. But when the mind does not exist, i.e., when Uन्मनीभाव is attained, even if objects that cause aversion or attraction are near, they do not cause pain or pleasure. Pleasure and pain are based on mental tendencies; they are not caused by the attainment of objects or by the enjoyment of objects. Therefore, why would those who know this truth not have a strong desire to worship the Sadguru, who is the cause of Uन्मनीभाव? It is certain that they will. ||53||

Now, for the sake of self-joy, which is the means to overcome the mind, it is said: 1007.

**Meaning:** O foolish one! O Lord of the Self! You are seeking to attain the Supreme Self. Why do you trouble yourself by going to other gods, offering them gifts, making vows, and seeking to obtain desired objects like wealth, fame, prosperity, kingdom, heaven, etc., through their service, worship, devotion, etc., with the desire to get rid of diseases, poverty, and other misfortunes? Alas! Why don't you please your own Self-God, so that the wealth of unreal things may be abandoned, and your vast kingdom of pure knowledge may manifest in the light of supreme brilliance? ||54||

**Explanation:** Here, "O Lord of the Self!" is said because he will be worthy of worship in the future. Until now, he has been trying to please other gods, or those who are called gods, by considering them as the Supreme Lord. In this, he has been deceived by being foolish. Therefore, by removing Rajoguna (passion) and Tamoguna (inertia), i.e., by removing the desire for worldly pleasures in this world or the next, O Lord of eternal happiness! Please your own Self-God. By doing so, you will surely obtain other worldly wealth or prosperity in the form of the removal of misfortunes; but you will also manifest the ownership of the vast kingdom of pure knowledge, which is the form of supreme light (knowledge). The meaning is that by abandoning the effort to please the whole world, please only your own soul, so that the wealth and power of Godhood can be easily obtained. Without it, all efforts are in vain. In such a kingdom, Uन्मनीभाव becomes easy. ||54||

We had previously stated that we had learned this from the ocean of principles, from the tradition of Sadgurus, and from self-experience. Now, we have fulfilled that statement by composing the Yoga Shastra text. Now, we conclude it. 1008.

**Meaning:** This Shastra, which is full of wonder, is a collection of the Upanishads and the teachings of the wise, which has been learned from the Shastra, from the mouth of the Sadguru, and from experience. It has been presented by the Acharya, Shri Hemachandra, at the request of the great King Shri Chaulukya Kumarapala. ||55||

## Description of Experienced Yoga - Conclusion

**Verse 55-52 of the Twelfth Light of Yoga Shastra:**

Meaning: From the Agamas and other scriptures, and from the mouth of the melodious Guru who beautifully explains them, and from my own experience, the little secret of Yoga that I have come to know, is so amazing that it would captivate the minds of learned scholars interested in Yoga. Therefore, at the earnest request of King Kumarapala of the Chalukya dynasty, Acharya Shri Hemchandra presented this treatise called Yoga Shastra through the medium of speech. ||5||

**Explanation:** Maharaja Shri Kumarapala was very fond of the practice of Yoga. He had also seen other scriptures on Yoga, so he had a desire to hear a unique (wonderful) Yoga Shastra. Even though he was unable to fulfill his promise, Acharya Shrimad Hemchandrasuri Shwaraji composed this treatise called "Adhyatma Upanishad", which is the essence of Yoga, and presented it through the medium of speech. ||5||

**Thus, it is auspicious.**

Now, at the end of this commentary (explanation), two verses are presented in the form of praise:

**Verse 1:**

Meaning: Concluding this self-composed commentary, I say that, inspired by the prayer of Kumarapala, born in the Chalukya dynasty, I have composed this commentary (detailed explanation) of Yoga Shastra, which is like an ocean of nectar for those who know the truth. This commentary is unique and will remain as long as the three worlds, heaven, earth, and hell, are filled with the Jain teachings.

**Verse 2:**

Meaning: Whatever good deeds (merit) I have earned by composing this Yoga Shastra and its commentary, may it make the worthy beings become lovers of the knowledge of the Jinas.

**Thus, this commentary on the twelve lights of Yoga Shastra, composed by Acharya Shri Hemchandra, at the service of the great King Kumarapala, is complete.**

**Thus, the Yoga Shastra is complete.**

## Verse
Verse Index (Appendix)
No.
Verse
Oh, the greatness of yoga, the fourfold category of phlegm, urine, and excrement, liberation, the killing of a disciple, poison, and execution
Brahma-woman-fetus-cow-killing
Even greater sins
Yoga is the eye of all calamities, yoga destroys sins,
First Light
One who gives up food when indigestion,
Or the five-member assembly
In the case of the not-very-clearly-hidden, not accepting what is not given
In the wrong place and time, the one who speaks falsely,
Non-violence - truthfulness - non-stealing Oh, the greatness of yoga, considering the posture, etc., after examining the criticism and understanding, even in the case of the urge to speak, eat, and take, these are the limbs of conduct,
These are the unpleasant ones, the sixfold category of internal enemies
Phlegm-urine-excrement, phlegm, urine, and excrement,
One who is always attached to good conduct
Even in the case of a person who has committed a crime, the fourfold category of liberation, the killing of a disciple, poison, and execution, the evil deed done at that time, may he not be born, the desires of the divine magnanimous, forty-two alms
-
A long-sighted expert
Salutation to the insurmountable passion, etc., not that which is due to carelessness, a just and prosperous being

## Verse
In the serpent and in the king of the gods, it is well-known by sins,
Beloved, wholesome, truthful speech, even though one has not attained dharma before,
Thoughts of Brahma-woman-fetus-cow-killing,
Even greater sins, the desire to keep the mind secret, the acceptance of what is not given, the proper guest, the virtuous, the true nature of things as they are
Yoga is the eye of all calamities,
Interest in the truth spoken by the Jina, the path that is highly praised by the world, spending what is appropriate, the web of liberation, the bed, seat, and deposit
Having learned from the ocean of scriptures,
By means of the removal of consciousness, etc., woman-eunuch-animal-house-woman-beautiful-limb-looking-self-limb-touching-taste-and-smell, from those of the same religion, in all states, fainting-fatigue-all-blameworthy-yogas,
With all one's being, the great ascetics, laughter-greed-fear-anger-yoga destroys sins,
Second Light
From the spotless mind, not a god, the mind of a god, evils go far away, even if one gives up all one's possessions, even if one comes from a lineage, this world is the other world,
From even a little falsehood, those who do not speak falsely, falsehood is lighter than you,

From false speech, hatred,

Dissatisfaction, disbelief, the happiness of the dissatisfied, non-violence, the fire of suffering, all beings are like oneself, according to the memory, one moment of suffering for one, even the king of wealth,
In these things, killing animals, medicines are animals, girl-cow-land-falsehoods, trembling, sweating, fatigue, fainting, a hunchback is better than a cripple, even a leper, remembering the same, bow-staff-wheel-sword, long-lived, well-formed, theft-sin-tree, here,

---------------------------
In the Nigodas and the Tiryanchas, the women with buttocks, cruel in their actions, should not create a husband or a son. They should not perform useless acts like scratching, itching, bending, etc. They should not desire to take what belongs to others. Because of the importance of possessions, they are immersed in the beginning of possessions, the life-force of conduct, the cause of doubt about life. The living being, due to its greed for other living beings, has fallen, forgotten, lost. To cross the boundless ocean, one should say, "I am afraid of the obstruction of the world," or "This is the seed of the world." The fearful, with a troubled mind, in the presence of honey and in the sacrifice, should not be attached to the mind, nor should they be attached to time. The mind is one thing, the speech is another. The wise, who are the bearers of the great vows, should be like a mother to all beings, mixing their flesh.

- - -

Friends, sons, and wives are instructed by false vision. Even though they say, "Die," they are consumed by the objects of the senses. Animals are created for the sake of sacrifice. Those who have the idea of God and Goddess, those who have done cruel deeds, those who are born from the womb of women, weapons, threads, etc., those who give fearlessness to beings, those who are born of blood, subtle worms, beautiful in appearance, with a beautiful body, virtuous, deceitful, cruel, harmless in the forest,

Better is a burning fire,

Better is a heretic, a Charvaka, even though the world is conquered by his strength,

Better is restraint from gross violence,

The world is trusting, foolish, peaceful, compassionate,

Peace, emotion, detachment,

It is heard that by killing a living being, doubt, desire, and uncertainty arise. Castration, cutting off the senses, six months of eating flesh, even of the virtuous,

He who has sexual intercourse with a woman,

From attachment, there arises instability, influence, devotion, the roots of right conduct,

There are three kinds of treasures for him,

Even if he is attached, if he is a god,

He makes an effort to protect his wife,

She who abandons her husband,

Whatever is against all the worlds, whatever is the taking away of all possessions, bondage,

The omniscient, who has conquered attachment, etc.,

All those who desire everything,

Even if they are related, they should be restrained,

For a year, with a cow,

The root of the world, the beginning of the sacrifice, which lasts for a long time, day and night,

Violence arises to obstruct the wife,

The root of knowledge and conduct,

The third illumination, without making a rule,

To put on the chain of virtues,

Burning with charcoal,

From the moment after the charcoal, the forest, the cart,

The thread-spoken of the infinite body,

Food for ghosts, demons, etc.,

He who allows, he who is cruel,

A multitude of animals, even if eaten for medicine,

Not obtaining other food,

Arise, then, these should be abandoned from eating,

Always eating meat, at the end of the day,

Arttaraudra meditation,

Moist root, even if it is whole,

Mixed with raw milk,

Taking a seat with devotion,

Thus, the daily routine, the coming and going of the non-self, the non-self, is summarized here in this world and in the next world.

Giving up, taking,

Udumbar, Vat,

Owl, crow, cat,

Even for one living being,

One crore of flowers, thus, with devotion, standing in the vow,

A bracelet, a piece of wood,

He who performs restraint is blessed,

Body, speech, mind,

Out of curiosity, singing, playing, oneself,

Some eat meat out of great delusion, anger, bondage,

Even householders are blessed,

With eyes closed by terrible darkness,

Four-footed, fourth, etc.,

Fallen, born among humans,

Of moving and non-moving beings,

He who eats flesh, etc.,

This is the state of equanimity, subtle, with the word of the omniscient, endowed with special potency and knowledge, free from attachment and aversion, and the eleven-fold illumination, the doctrine of non-absolutism, favorable like the wind, even with the fuel of separation, hundreds of millions of beings bowing at his feet, this one is ours, his nails and hairs, roaring in front of him, his autumnal moon-like brilliance, heard first from the life-karma of the Shruta-dependence, hundreds of arrangements are fierce, the Asoka with red leaves, thus in diversity, sharp, this is the first unification, the production, existence, and destruction, etc., are all together, the first, the one-three-fold, thus according to the Shruta,
The noble, the luminous, the pure, the one who dwells in the mountain, the four-cornered, the people who revolve, the three umbrellas are pure, like the mind of the one who is hidden, it burns, and from that, the concentration, the name, the object, only, then, the action that has arisen, there, from the Shruta, taking one, the three worlds, the object, from meditation, the gods of the three heavens, the humans, the name of the Tirthankara, the brilliance, the mass of light, the spread, the illumination, the staff, the shield, the churning, the god, then, that Bhagavan, he does not hold health, at the time of entering Nirvana, not upward, from the absence of the object, the five sense objects,

1. **Ahimsa** (non-violence)
2. **Satya** (truthfulness)
3. **Asteya** (non-stealing)
4. **Brahmacharya** (continence)
5. **Aparigraha** (non-attachment)

"Whatever good deed is done, even a small portion of the **Ratnatraya** (three jewels), I accept it all. Even following the path, even a little, is a good deed. Following the path, doing good deeds, whatever I am able to do, I offer my approval to all. This too is a good deed.

Wherever you are, be there. Whether your friend comes to you to do good or your enemy comes to you to do harm, be equal in your vision.

The mind is not driven by the soul, nor are the senses driven by the mind. When both are corrupted, then they perish on their own." - **Dvayashriyam Apabhramsha** and **Yoga Shastra**
