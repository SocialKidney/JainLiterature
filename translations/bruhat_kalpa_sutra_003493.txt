Under the heading "Three Chhedamutras", the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha, Brihat-Kalpa and Vyavahar, these three Chhedamutras are published. Due to the large number of pages, the Nisha-Mutra has been published as a separate volume. The translation, commentary, editing, etc. of these four Chhedasutras has been done with great effort, dedication and concentration by Muni Shri Tilokmuniji in the presence of Anuyoagpravartak Muni Shri Kanhaiyalalji M. 'Kamal'. Therefore, readers should contact Muni Shri Tilokmuniji for the solution of their queries related to Chhedasutras. The Chhedasutras are included in the last section of the Agambattisi. With their publication, the publication work of all the Agamas has been completed. Therefore, as a token of gratitude, the committee presents its request. When Yuvacharya Shri Sw. Shraddhey Madhukaramuniji M. Sa. was studying the Agamas with his Maha-Mahim Gurudev Shri Zoravarmalji M. Sa., Gurudev Shri had expressed his feelings many times that if the Agamas were made available in a simple and understandable language and style along with their commentaries, it would be very useful for reading and studying. Yuvacharya Shri was inspired by these feelings of Gurudev Shri. He discussed with his elder Guru-Mata Swami Shri Hazarimlalji M., Swami Shri Brijlalji M., made plans and when he completed the plan on his own, he also informed the learned Muni-Rajas, learned Sadhvis about his ideas. He consulted with the Sad-Grihasthas. In this way, the plan was approved by everyone and the committee. Then, on Vaishakh Shukla 10, Vikram Samvat 2036, the day of the Nirvana of Bhagwan Mahavir, the announcement was made to start the editing and publication of Bhagwan's Deshana-rupa Agambattisi and the work started according to the prescribed rules and regulations. On the Yuvacharya Chadar-Pradan Mahatmav Day, the Gracharangamutra was presented to the readers as Jinagam Granthamala Granth-Ank 1. This publication tradition was going on at a rapid pace when a terrible incident occurred. Deep waves of sadness engulfed the committee. The planner Yuvacharya Shri passed away. This was a great loss. But, with the strength of the courage and the blessings of Sw. Yuvacharya Shri, the committee remained committed to its work. It is the result of this that the great work of publishing the Agambattisi, which was started, has been completed as per the rules. The committee is grateful to Adhyatmayogini Vidushi Maha-Mati Shri Umravakoovarji M. Sa. "Archana" for her guidance and for inspiring the committee to complete the work by filling the void left by Yuvacharya Shri. Padmashri Mohanmalji...

## Editorial Note: A Critical Review of the Cheda-Sutras

The Jain tradition, as understood by the Sthānakavāsī, recognizes 32 Āgamas as the word of the liberated ones (Vītarāga-vāṇī). These are: eleven Angas, twelve Upangas, four Mūlas, four Chedas, and one Prāvaśyaka. 

The Śvetāmbara Mūrti-pūjaka tradition, however, recognizes forty-five Āgamas. The number of Angas, Upangas, etc. remains the same. However, they include Mahāniśītha and Pañcakalpa along with Niśītha, Daśāśrutaskandha, Bṛhatkalpa, and Vyavahārasūtra in the Prakīrṇakas and Cheda-sūtras.

The Āgamas, including Angas, Upangas, etc., encompass all aspects of literature: religion, philosophy, ethics, culture, civilization, history, art, etc. However, they primarily focus on elaborating Jain philosophy, religious principles, and ethical practices. The Angas, Upangas, and Mūla-varga primarily deal with theoretical concepts. Ācārāṅga, Upāsaka Daśāṅga, and Prāvaśyaka Sūtras extensively discuss ethical practices. The Cheda-sūtras are the embodiments of rules and regulations for ethical purity. This note provides some insights into the Cheda-sūtras.

Why the name Cheda-sūtra? The term "Cheda" is not new to the Jain tradition. The second of the five types of conduct is called Chedopa sthāpanācāritra. While the general meaning of "Cheda" is the piercing of body parts like ears, nose, etc., the meaning of "Cheda" in the context of religion is as follows:

"Vajjhāṇuṭāṇeṇam jeṇa ṇa bāhijjjae taje ṇiyaya. Sambhavaī ya parisuddha' so puṇa dhammammī cheutti."

This means that "Cheda" is that which does not hinder religion through external actions and leads to increased purity. Therefore, the characteristic of Chedopa sthāpanā is to establish the soul in the five types of Yama-like Dharma, namely non-violence, etc., by abandoning the old, cautious practices. Or, Chedopa sthāpanā-samyama is the abandonment of actions like violence, theft, etc., with their respective distinctions, and the purification through atonement, etc., when a vow is broken. This is of two types: Nirati-cāra and Sāti-cāra.

In Nirati-cāra Chedopa sthāpanā, the practitioner is established in the five great vows, namely non-violence, etc., by separating them from the previous Samayika conduct, which involved the complete abandonment of all actions. In Sāti-cāra Chedopa sthāpanācāritra, atonement is necessary along with criticism for re-establishment (punaḥ sthāpita). This atonement is based on the severity of the transgression. There are ten types of atonement, of which Cheda-prāyaścitta is the seventh. There are seven atonements, from critical atonement to Cheda-prāyaścitta, which are given to the clothed ascetics. The last three are given to the unclothed ascetics.

---------------------------
The **Chhedaprayaschitta** is the final **prayaschitta** (atonement) given to **veshamukta shramanas** (Jain monks who have renounced all worldly possessions). It encompasses the six previous **prayaschittas**. **Moolah**, **Anvasthapyai**, and **Parinchikai** **prayaschittas** are considered minor, while **Aalochaanah** to **Chhedaah** **prayaschittas** are considered major. Due to their extensive nature, the **Dasha Shruta Skandha** (Acharadasa), **Brihatkalpa**, **Vyavahar**, and **Nishith** Agamas are referred to as **Chhedasutras**.

The general subject matter of the **Chhedasutras** can be understood from the above statement. They address how to avoid and rectify any faults committed by a **sadhaka** (spiritual aspirant) during their **sadhanamay** (spiritual) life. From this perspective, the topics of the **Chhedasutras** can be divided into four parts:

1. **Utsargamarga** (Path of Renunciation)
2. **Apavadamarga** (Path of Exception)
3. **Doshasevan** (Committing Faults)
4. **Prayaschittavidhan** (Atonement Regulations)

1. **Utsargamarga** refers to the rules that are mandatory for **sadhu-sadhvi** (Jain monks and nuns). It involves adhering to the **samachari** (conduct) without any deviation or alteration. This path emphasizes the practice of **nirdosha charitra** (faultless conduct). Following this path ensures **aprammatta** (mindfulness) in the **sadhaka** and makes them worthy of praise and respect.

2. **Apavadamarga** refers to special rules. It is of two types: (1) **Nirdosha Visheshvidhi** (Faultless Special Rule) and (2) **Sadosha Visheshvidhi** (Faulty Special Rule). Special rules are stronger than general rules. **Apavadic** rules are based on reasons. The **praagaras** (barriers) placed in **uttaragunapratyakhyan** (rejection of higher qualities) are all **nirdosha apavadas** (faultless exceptions). An action or tendency that does not violate **prajna** (wisdom) is considered **nirdosha**. However, due to strong reasons, even if the mind is unwilling, one may be compelled to commit a fault. This is considered **sadosha apavada** (faulty exception). **Prayaschitta** (atonement) purifies such faults. This path protects the **sadhaka** from **praart-raudr dhyan** (meditation with anger and violence). While not praiseworthy, it is not so reprehensible as to cause public criticism. **Anachar** (immorality) cannot be considered a part of **apavadavidhi** (exceptional rule) in any form.

3. **Doshasevan** refers to violating the **Utsargamarga** and **Apavadamarga** paths. The process of purification for such violations is called **prayaschitta**.

4. **Prayaschittavidhan** is the regulation of **prayaschitta** for the purification of faults. This regulation is essential for **doshashuddhi** (purification of faults).

The above statement reveals the importance of **prayaschitta** for purification. In this context, some specific points are highlighted.

Page #12:
---------------------------
The reason for placing Charitraachar amidst the five principles of Anugardharma is that it is the only means by which the combined practice of Jnanaachar, Darshanachar, and Tapaachar-Veeryachar can be accomplished without hindrance. Charitraachar has eight divisions: five Samitis and three Guptis. The five Samitis are like a retreat-oriented tendency in a disciplined life, while the three Guptis are purely retreat-oriented. Their role in Anugardharma practice is evident in an unprecedented joy and enthusiasm. However, due to the influence of worldly passions, like attachment and aversion, if the boundaries of Samitis, Guptis, and Mahavrats are occasionally transgressed, violated, or exceeded, then Prayashchitta acts as a protective wall. The implication is that if there is a persistent attachment to the original qualities (Moolgunas) and the subsequent qualities (Uttargunas), then Prayashchitta is mandatory for their removal. The reason for the prominence of Chhedprayashchitta is that there are ten types of Prayashchitta. The first six Prayashchittas are for the purification of general faults, while the last four are for the purification of strong faults. Chhedarha Prayashchitta is the first of the last four Prayashchittas. The commentators, while explaining it, have presented an allegory from Ayurveda. Its essence is that if a person's limbs or organs become so contaminated by disease or poison that there is no possibility of recovery through treatment, then it is appropriate to amputate that limb or organ through surgery. However, the disease or poison should not be allowed to spread throughout the body. Because if this is not done, untimely death is inevitable. But before amputation, it is the duty of the physician to explain to the patient and his close relatives that the limb or organ has become so contaminated by disease that there is no possibility of recovery through nourishing treatment. If they want to protect their life and be free from pain, then they should have the limb or organ amputated through surgery. Although there will be intense pain during the surgery, it will be for a short time, but the rest of their life will be free from the current pain. If, after this explanation, the patient and his guardians agree to the amputation, then it is the duty of the physician to amputate the limb or organ to protect the body and life from the disease. In the same way, the Acharya and other Anugars should be explained that due to the persistent attachment to faults, your subsequent qualities have become so contaminated that their purification is no longer possible through ordinary Prayashchittas like criticism, etc. Now, if you wish, the days of persistent attachment can be amputated to secure the rest of your disciplined life. Otherwise, neither Samadhi-death nor liberation from the cycle of birth and death will be possible. If, after this explanation, the Anugar abandons persistent attachment and accepts Chhedprayashchitta, then the Acharya should purify him by giving him Chhedprayashchitta. It should be noted here that Chhedprayashchitta only purifies the faults attached to the subsequent qualities. The faults attached to the original qualities are purified by Mool-ah and other three Prayashchittas. The style of description in Chhedsutras: Three types of Charitraachar are presented in Chhedsutras: (1) Heyaachar, (2) Jneyaachar, (3) Upadeyaachar. Upon detailed consideration of these, the following forms emerge: (1) Vidhikल्प, (2) Nishedhakल्प, (3) Vidhinisedhakल्प, (4) Prayashchittakalp, (5) Prakirnak. Of these, there will be four divisions of other Vidhi-kalpadic, besides Prayashchittakalp. [11]

(1) Legal precepts for the Nirgranthas, (2) Legal precepts for the Nigranthis, (3) Legal precepts for the Nirgrantha-Nigranthis, (4) General legal precepts / Similarly, one should also understand the prohibitive precepts, etc. / The sutras in which the word 'Kappar' is used are the legal precepts. Those in which the word 'No Kappar' is used are the prohibitive precepts. Those in which both 'Kappar' and 'No Kappar' are used are the legal-prohibitive precepts and those in which neither 'Kappar' nor 'No Kappar' is used are the legal precepts. For the atonement, there is a clear mention in the sutras at the appropriate place. In the Cheda Sutras, after mentioning the general legal-prohibitive precepts, a clear indication of the legal and prohibitive precepts for the Nirgranthas has been given. Similarly, the statement of the legal-prohibitive precepts for the Nirgranthi is there. It is not possible to give a detailed list here of what and which legal-prohibitive form is for both and how much atonement is there for each in case of transgression. Readers can find out themselves by looking at the scriptures. The atonement is for the purification of the fault of the giver and the receiver. The Cheda Sutras have a detailed description regarding the eligibility of the giver and the receiver. Here we are giving a brief summary of it. Transgression, violation, abuse, and misconduct are the causes of transgression / But those who do not criticize the faults due to crookedness and inertia can never become eligible for purification / Even if someone criticizes deceitfully, his criticism is not fruitful. If his mind is not ready to criticize, then doing atonement is like a flower in the sky. The essence of the above statement is that the critic should be upright and free from deceit. He should have a feeling of repentance in his heart, only then he will be able to be ready for the purification of the fault. Similarly, the one who listens to the criticism of the critic and is entitled to help in his purification is the one who understands the essence of the atonement, is neutral, knows the feelings of others, is able to understand the situation, is himself innocent, is impartial, and is a worthy speaker. Such a senior practitioner can make the guilty innocent. He can discipline the Sangha and remove public slander and misconceptions. Based on this brief introduction, we now present a brief introduction to the three Cheda Sutras compiled in this book - 1. Dasha Shruta Skandha, 2. Brihat Kalpa and 3. Vyavahar. (1) Dasha Shruta Skandha or Prachar Dasha Samavayanga, Uttara Adhyayana and Aavashyak Sutra have been called Ayar Dasha (Achar Dasha) or name before Kalpa and Vyavahar Sutra. Therefore, this is the first Cheda Sutra in the Cheda Sutras. It has become more popular as 'Dasha Shruta Skandha' because its ten chapters are mentioned in the tenth place of the Sthananga Sutra. The names of the ten chapters are as follows - 1. Asamadhi Sthan, 2. Sabal Dosha, 3. Ashatana, 4. Ganisampada, 5. Chitta Samadhi Sthan, 6. Upasak Pratima, 7. Bhiksha Pratima, 8. Paryushana Kalpa 9. Mohaniya Sthan and 10. Ayati Sthan / In these ten chapters, Asamadhi Sthan, [12]

Page #14:
---------------------------
The elements compiled in the Chittasamadhi Sthana, Mohaniya Sthana and Ayati Sthana are actually related to Yoga Vidya. If compared with Yoga Shastra, it will be known that these four studies are very important in the ten studies of the Pracharadasha for concentrating and unifying the mind. The Upasaka Pratima and Bhikku Pratima impart knowledge of the highest rules of the most rigorous practice of the Shravaka and Shraman. In the Paryushana Kalpa, it has been discussed in detail how to perform Paryushana, how to celebrate it, and when to celebrate it. In these two Dasha, Sabaldosha and Ashatana, the daily rules of Sadhu life have been discussed and it has been said that these rules should be followed. What is to be abandoned should be abandoned firmly and what is to be adopted should be followed. In the fourth Dasha, Dashaganisampada, a very useful description of the personality, influence and physical influence of the person sitting on the Acharya Pad has been given. It is necessary for those who are engaged in the desire for the Acharya Pad to study these before taking the Acharya Pad. Thus, this Dasha Shruta Skandha (Acharadasha) holds a very important place in the Shraman life. In other words, the subject matter of the Dasha of Dasha Shruta Skandha can also be mentioned as follows: The first three Dasha and the last two Dasha present the Heyachar of the Sadhaka. The fourth Dasha states the Gneyachar of the Agitart Anugar and the Upadeyachar for the Gitart Anugar. The fifth Dasha describes the Upadeyachar. The sixth Dasha states the Jayachar for the Anugar and the Upadeyachar for the Sagar (Shramanopasaka). The seventh Dasha states the Upadeyachar for the Anugar and the Gneyachar for the Sagar. The eighth Dasha has some Gneyachar, some Heyachar and some Upadeyachar for the Anugar. Thus, this Acharadasha-Dasha Shruta Skandha is useful for both Anugar and Sagar. In the Chhedasutra like Kalpa, Vyavahar etc., also the Hey, Gney and Upadeya Prachar has been stated. (2) The word Kalpa in Brihatkalpasutra is indicative of many meanings. This word is found in Vedic literature. There are six limbs of the Veda, one of them is the limb in which the rules of rituals like Yajna are given, that limb is called Kalpa. The word Kalpa is also used for time. The time of fourteen Manvantaras is known by the word Kalpa. Four billion, thirty-two crore years pass in it. This long period of time is called Kalpa. The word Kalpa is also used in a similar sense, such as Shraman Kalpa, Rishi Kalpa etc. The word Kalpa is also used for the tree which gives the desired fruit, it is called Kalpavriksha. The word Kalpa is also used for the state boundary. There is a political boundary up to the twelfth Devaloka. For this reason, those Devalokas are called 'Kalpa Devalokas'. Whoever lives life according to the legal rules, he definitely becomes rich in happiness and wealth. The word Kalpa, which is used to describe the present scripture, is completely different from the above meanings. [13]

Page #15:
---------------------------
In this context, the word "Kalpa" refers to Dharma-Maryada (religious norms and boundaries).  Sadhu Achar (conduct of a monk) is Dharma-Maryada.  Any scripture that describes Dharma-Maryada is called Kalpa, as the name reflects the subject matter.  A name that accurately reflects the subject matter of a scripture is called a "Yatharth Naam" (true name).  A scripture that provides guidance and boundaries for the internal and external conduct of a Sadhu is called Kalpa.  The scripture that contains the life stories of Bhagwan Mahavir, Parshvanath, Arishtanemi, and Rishabhdev, has a final chapter that describes the conduct of a Sadhu.  This scripture is called "Paryushana Kalpa" and is considered a "Lahu Kalpa" (smaller Kalpa).  In comparison, a scripture that provides a more detailed description of Sadhu-Maryada is called "Bhatva Kalpa".  It generally describes the rules and regulations of the three types of conduct: Samayik, Chhedopasthapaneya, and Parihar Vishuddhi.  It is mandatory for those who follow these types of conduct to adhere to all the descriptions in the Brihat Kalpa scripture.  The scripture that describes the various norms of Sadhu and Sadhvi is called "Bhat Kalpa Sutra".  In Prakrit language, it is called "Bihakkappa Suttam".  The question of whether "Kappsuttam" (Kalpa Sutra) and "Kappsury" (Kalpa Shruta) are the same or different is irrelevant, as "Kappsuttam" is a Kalik Agam (scripture of the time).  The eighth study of Acharadasha (conduct) or Dasha Shruta Skandha is "Paryushana Kalpa", which only describes the conduct during the rainy season.  A few centuries ago, this "Paryushana Kalpa" was combined with the life stories of Tirthankaras and the list of elders (Sthaviravali).  Gradually, it became known as "Kalpa Sutra" among the general public.  To differentiate this Kalpa Sutra from the present one, the present Kalpa Sutra is called "Bhat Kalpa Sutra".  In reality, there is no mention of a scripture named "Bhat Kalpa Sutra" in any other scripture.  In the Nandisutra, it is called "Kapo".  There are two divisions of "Kappsury": "Chullakappsury" and "Mahakappsury".  Similarly, "Kappiyakappiyan" is also an Utkalik Agam (scripture of the time).  All these are scriptures that prescribe atonement, but they are fragmented, according to historians of Jain literature.  The original text of the present "Kappsuttam" is in prose and contains 473 Anushtup Shlokas.  It contains 81 rules and prohibitions (Vidhi-Nishedhakalpa).  All these Kalpas are related to the five Samitis (vows) and five Mahavratas (great vows).  Therefore, they are classified here.  The scriptures that are related to more than one Samiti or more than one Mahavrat are placed under the heading "Samiti and Mahavrat's combined rules and prohibitions" and "Mahavrat Kalpa".  According to Uttaradhyayanasutra Chapter 24, the subject of Iryasamiti is very broad, so the scriptures that appear to be generally related to knowledge, perception, or conduct, etc., are placed under the heading "Iryasamiti's rules and prohibitions".  The classification chart is as follows: (1) Iryasamiti's rules and prohibitions: 1. Charsutra, 2. Adhwagaman Sutra, 3. Aryakshetra Sutra, 4. Mahandi Sutra, 5. Bairajya-Viruddha Rajya Sutra, 6. Antagruhastha, 7. Vachana Sutra, 8. Sanjnapya Sutra, 9. Ganantaropa Sampat Sutra, 10. Kalpasthiti Sutra.  1. Abhidhan Rajendra: Volume 3, page 239 discusses the word "Kappsury".  [14]

This *sutra* is also named after the five *Vyavahara* as the main ones. 1. As many *sutras* as there are in the *Upashray* Law-Prohibition-Formulas, they are mostly also the Law-Prohibition-Formulas of the fourth *Mahavrat*. 2. These *sutras* are the ones that prescribe the *Vinaya* *Yavaty* and *Prayaschitta* etc. internal austerities. 3. The first *Chhedasutra* is *Dasha* (*Ayaradasha Dasha-Shruta-Skandha*), the second *Chhedasutra* is *Kalpa* (*Brihatkalpa*) and the third *Chhedasutra* is *Vyavahara* / See *Sama* 26 *Sutra* 2 / Or *Utta* *A* 31, *Ga* 17 / The commentator's opinion is that the fifth *sutra* of the tenth *Uddeshaka* of the *Vyavaharasutra* is the last *sutra*. All the *sutras* from the *Purushaprakar* to the *Dasavidhavaiyaavaty* are either *Parivadhit* or *Chulikarup*. [ 15 ]

The word "vyavahar" is formed from the combination of the prefixes "vi" and "av" and the root "har". "Vi" indicates diversity or method, "av" indicates doubt, and "har" indicates the action of removing. Therefore, "vyavahar" refers to the removal of various doubts related to a matter of dispute. This is the specific meaning of the word "vyavahar".

The main topics of the "vyavahar sutra" are: 1. "vyavahar" (conduct), 2. "vyavahari" (one who conducts), and 3. "vyavahartavya" (that which is to be conducted).

The last sutra of the tenth uddeśaka states that there are five "vyavahar karan" (means of conduct). The "vyavahari" (those who conduct the action of conduct) are the "geetarth" (teachers, etc.) who purify the "gan" (community). The "shraman" and "shramanis" (monks and nuns) are the "vyavahartavya" (those who are to be conducted). This means that the "vyavaharajna" (one who knows conduct) conducts the action of purifying the "gan" from transgressions. Just as a potter (doer) uses a wheel, a stick, clay, and a thread, etc. (means) to make a pot (action), similarly, the "vyavaharajna" uses "vyavahar" (conduct) to purify the "vyavahartavya" (community) from transgressions.

There are two main interpretations of "vyavahar": 1. "laukika" (worldly) and 2. "lokoत्तर" (transcendental). The "laukika" interpretation is of two types: 1. "samanya" (general) and 2. "vishesh" (specific). The general interpretation is conduct with others or the exchange of money. The specific interpretation is the entire process of litigation, i.e., justice.

There are some words related to this specific interpretation that have been in use since ancient times in the Vedic tradition of "shruti" (revealed knowledge) and "smriti" (remembered knowledge). These include:

1. "vyavaharshastra" (law code): This deals with the rules and regulations made collectively by the state government on a particular subject, as well as the punishment for violating those rules.

1. "Vi" for "nanartha" (various meanings), "av" for "sandeha" (doubt), "haran" is called "har" (removal). "Nana sandehaharanad, vyavahar iti sthitih" (From the removal of various doubts, the state of "vyavahar" arises). - Katyayana

2. "Nana vivad vishaya sanśayo hiyate'nena iti vyavaharah" (This removes doubts related to various matters of dispute, hence "vyavahar").

3. "Chattari purisajaya pannatta, tam jahaganasohi kare nama ege no manakare..." (There are four types of people, and among them, the "ganasohi kare" is not a "manakare" (a person who is not a monk)). - Vyavahar Purushaprakar Sutra

4. "Gaha-vahari khalu katta, vavaharo hoi karanbhuto u. Vahiravvam kajja, kubhadi tiyassa jah siddi" (The "gaha-vahari" (householder) is the doer, and "vyavahar" is the means. The "vahiravvam kajja" (work to be done) is like the making of a pot, etc., which is achieved through the means). - Vyavahar Bhadyapithika Gatha 2

5. "Na kashchit kasyachit mitram, na kashchit kasyachid ripuh / Vyavaharena jayante, mitrani ripavastatha" (No one is a friend of anyone, and no one is an enemy of anyone. Friends and enemies are created through "vyavahar"). - Hitopadeśa, Mitralabdha, 72

6. "Parasparam manushyanam, svarthavipratipattishu / Vakyanayaad vyavasthan, vyavahar udahritah" (Among humans, in matters of conflicting interests, "vyavahar" is described as the establishment of a settlement through words). - Mitakshara [16]

2. A **Vyavahārjña** (judge) who is knowledgeable in **Vyavahārśāstra** (law) is the one who considers and decides on accusations, etc., with discernment.  There are two types of **lokoत्तर** interpretations: 1. General and 2. Specific. / The general interpretation is the conduct of one **gaṇa** (group) with another **gaṇa**, or the conduct of one **śramaṇa** (ascetic) with another **śramaṇa**, or the conduct of one **ācārya**, **upādhyāya**, etc., with another **ācārya**, **upādhyāya**, etc. / The specific interpretation is the "**vapan**" (sowing) of **tapa** (austerities) and other practices through the **sarvajñokta vidhi** (method of the omniscient) and the removal of **atičārajanaya pāpa** (sin arising from transgression) is **vyavahāra**. The **bhāṣyakāra** (commentator) instructs that the word **vyavahāra** is created by combining the word **hāra** with the word **vyav** in place of the word **vivāpa**. There are two types of **vyavahāra**: 1. **vidhi vyavahāra** and 2. **avidhi vyavahāra**. / **Avidhi vyavahāra** is against **mokṣa** (liberation), therefore it is not the subject of this sūtra, but **vidhi vyavahāra** is its subject. There are four types of **vyavahāra**: 1. **nāma vyavahāra**, 2. **sthāpanā vyavahāra**, 3. **dravya vyavahāra**, and 4. **bhāva vyavahāra**. 1. **Nāma vyavahāra** - a particular person being named "**vyavahāra**". / 2. **Sthāpanā vyavahāra** - the true or false representation of the person named "**vyavahāra**". / 3. **Dravya vyavahāra** has two divisions: from **āgama** (scripture) and from **noāgama** (non-scripture). From **āgama** - the knower of the inappropriate (useless) **vyavahāra** word. / From **noāgama** - **dravya vyavahāra** is of three types: 1. **jñaśarīra**, 2. **bhavyasarīra**, and 3. **tadvyatirikta**. / **Jñaśarīra** - the dead body of the knower of the **vyavahāra** word. / **Bhavyasarīra** - the future body of the knower of the **vyavahāra** word. / **Tadvyaitirikta** **dravya vyavahāra** - **vyavahāra** scripture or book. / This is of three types: 1. **laukika**, 2. **lokoत्तर**, and 3. **kuprāvanika**. The development of **laukika** **dravya vyavahāra** began with the development of humans from the **bhogabhūmi** (land of enjoyment). Even in that ancient time, men lived as husbands and women as wives, but their sexual desire was very limited. They had only two children (at once) in their entire life. Of these, one was a boy and one was a girl. "We two, our two" was the motto of their worldly life. They would become husband and wife in their youth as brother and sister. 1. **Vyav. Bhāṣya.

Their means of livelihood were Kalpavriksha / Sitting on gold in their shade, eating fruits, drinking the nectar of trees / They wore bark and listened to the music of trees every moment / They did not work, nor did they have any kind of worry, therefore they were long-lived and very happy. They did not do Dharma, nor did they do sinful deeds, there was no speaker, no listener, they were not arrogant, no one punished them, there was no ruler, nor were they ruled. Such was the life of the couple / The cycle of time was moving. The land of enjoyment was beginning to turn into the land of karma. The means of livelihood, Kalpavriksha, were disappearing. The problems of eating, drinking, and sleeping were beginning to torment them. What to eat and drink? Where to live, where to sleep? Above was the sky, below was the earth. How to protect oneself from cold, heat, and rain?  Many such worries had surrounded man. There was a scramble for food and drink. Premature deaths began to occur and the life of the couple (husband and wife) became unmatched. The first Sushma-Sushma period and the second Sushma period had ended. The two divisions of the third Sushma-Dushma period had also ended. The third division's vicious cycle was going on / It was a time of transition / For the sake of happiness, peace, and order, the first five Kulkaras first tortured the criminals with the 'Hat' verbal punishment, but after some time this punishment became ineffective. This was the first principle of the suppression policy of punishment. The era of implanting violence in the human heart began here. The second five Kulkaras influenced the attackers by torturing them with the "Mat" verbal punishment, but this punishment also became ineffective as time passed / The third five Kulkaras ruled and suppressed those who spread unrest with the "Dhik" verbal punishment. Although these three punishments of the punishable were only verbal punishments, but the punishment, synonymous with violence, did not make man gentle but cruel, not merciful but wicked. The name of the first Kulkar was "Sumati". He was to use "Shaman" for the happiness and prosperity of mankind, but influenced by the crooked cycles of time, he also started the vicious cycle of "Daman". The last Kulkar was Shri Rishabhdev. When the punishment policy of condemnation also failed, the Karma Tripdi "1 Asi, 2 Masi, 3 Krishi" emerged from the mouth of Lord Rishabhdev (Adinath). The sunrise of human social life took place / Human society was divided into two classes / One class of rulers and one class of ruled. The minority ruling class began to discipline the majority ruled class. Lord Adinath's son Bharat became the emperor / He also began to use the suppression policy inherited from his ancestors on his brothers. When the original source of Upshamars, Lord Adinath (Rishabhdev), encouraged Bahubali and others for the eternal (spiritual) kingdom, they agreed. Because the humans of that era were of 'righteous nature'. The burning desire for the kingdom in the hearts of the brothers was completely extinguished by the invincible stream of non-violence. [18]

---------------------------
From the time of Bhagwan Ajitanath to Bhagwan Parshvanath, it was the era of 'Rijprajna' humans. During the reign of eleven Chakravartis, nine Baldevs, nine Vasudevas and nine Prativa-sudevas, the cycle of punishment was so oppressive that people almost forgot the gentle path of Shraman-niti. The policies of inducement, punishment and division were widely propagated. Now, the era of 'Vakrajada' humans has arrived. The human heart is dominated by crookedness and inertia. Punishment (suppression) has been considered essential for social order. Mutilation and capital punishment have become commonplace. Penal codes and instruments of punishment have been created. Criminal courts and criminology have also developed. In the past, weapons like Agniyastra and in the present, weapons like nuclear bombs have been used to suppress people through cruel punishment. In ancient literature, there is a description of a Dandapani (Yama Raja), but today, many Dandapanis can be seen walking around everywhere. This is worldly material interaction. Lokottara Dravyavyavahar - the interaction of free Shramans who disregard the teachings of Acharyas, etc., with other free Shramans, such as the exchange of food, etc. Lokottara Bhavyavyavahar - this is of two types: 1. From Pagam and 2. From Nomagam. From Agam - the one who knows the meaning of the word 'Upayukta Vyavahar'. From Nomagam, there are five types of behavior: 1. Agam, 2. Shruta, 3. Agyna, 4. Dharana, 5. Jeet. 1. Where there is Pagam, establish behavior from Pagam. 2. Where there is no Agam, but Shruta, establish behavior from Shruta. 3. Where there is no Shruta, but Prajna, establish behavior from Prajna. 4. Where there is no Prajna, but Dharana, establish behavior from Dharana. 5. Where there is no Dharana, but Jeet, establish behavior from Jeet. Establish behavior from these five: 1. Pagam, 2. Shruta, 3. Prajna, 4. Dharana and 5. Jeet. Wherever any of these exist, establish behavior from that. Question: Bhanta! What have the Pagambalik Shraman Nirgranthas said (regarding these five behaviors)? Answer: (Ayushman Shramans) In these five behaviors, whenever there is a particular behavior in a particular matter, the Shraman Nirgrantha, remaining impartial (mediator), behaves correctly and becomes a follower of the Agyna! 1.

**Agamvyavahar** is the method of conduct and prohibitions practiced or formulated by Kevalgyanis, Manahparyavgyanis, and Avadhigyanis. The method of conduct and prohibitions practiced or formulated by the fourteen, ten, and nine purvadharis is also Agamvyavahar.

**Shrutavyavahar** is the method of conduct and prohibitions practiced or formulated by the eight purna and ninth apurna dharis. The method of conduct and prohibitions specified by the ten (Ayara Dasha - Dasha Shruta Skandha), Kalpa (Brihat Kalpa), Vyavahar, Achar Prakalpa (Nishith), etc. Cheda Shruta (Shastra) is also Shrutavyavahar.

**Agyavvyavahar** is when two Geetarth Shramans are traveling in different countries far apart from each other and there is no possibility of meeting in the near future. If one of them has to take the atonement for Kalpika Pratisevna, then he should send his transgression to the Geetarth Shishya. If there is no Geetarth Shishya, then he should send his transgression to the Dharana Kushal Ageetarth Shishya in a symbolic language and send it to the distant Geetarth Muni. After listening to the criticism, the Geetarth Muni should consider the Dravya, Kshetra, Kala, Bhav, Sanhanan, Dhairya, Bal, etc. and go there himself and give atonement. Or he should send the Geetarth Shishya to explain. If there is no Geetarth Shishya, then he should send the message of atonement for transgression-purification in symbolic languages along with the one who brought the message of criticism. This is Agyavvyavahar.

**Dharnavvyavahar** is when a Geetarth Shraman has given atonement for a transgression based on Dravya, Kshetra, Kala, and Bhav, and another Shraman who has committed the same transgression takes atonement according to the Dharna.

**Agamvyavahar** can be divided into three categories based on the concept of Kalpana: Utkrishta, Madhyama, and Jaghanya.

1. **Utkrishta Agamvyavahar** is the method of conduct and prohibitions practiced or formulated by Kevalgyanis, because Kevalgyan is complete direct knowledge.

2. **Madhyama Agamvyavahar** is the method of conduct and prohibitions practiced or formulated by Manahparyavgyanis or Avadhigyanis, because although Manahparyavgyan and Avadhigyan are partial (Desha) direct knowledge, they are both self-relative.

3. **Jaghanya Agamvyavahar** is the method of conduct and prohibitions practiced or formulated by the fourteen, ten, and nine purvadharis, because although they are specific Shruta, they are indirect.

"Dharṇāvyavahāra" is the practice of accepting and adhering to a particular conduct. Alternatively, "Vaiyāvatya" refers to the act of a Śramaṇa who has benefited the Gaṇa through service, but who has not been able to learn the "Chhedashruta." In such a case, the Guru Mahārāja would make him accept certain "Prāyaścitta" (penance) practices. This too is considered "Dharṇāvyavahāra."

"Jītavyavahāra" encompasses the concepts of "Sthiti" (state), "Kalpa" (time), "Maryādā" (limit), and "Vyavasthā" (system). These are synonyms for "Jīta." The pure conduct that is established through "Gīta" (scripture) is "Jītavyavahāra."

"Jītavyavahāra" also includes the practice of performing "Prāyaścitta" that is either less or more than what is prescribed in the "Śruta" (scripture), but is traditionally practiced. If, in addition to the reasons mentioned in the "Sūtra" (aphorism), other reasons arise, and the "Aticāra" (excess) is rectified through "Prāyaścitta" practiced by many "Gīta" (scripture) scholars, then that too is "Jītavyavahāra." The rules and prohibitions established by many "Gīta" (scripture) scholars and unanimously agreed upon are also considered "Jītavyavahāra."

If, while the "Prāyaścitta" for violating the "Vyavahārapañcaka" (five types of conduct) is prescribed by the "Āgama" (scripture), someone practices "Śrutavyavahāra" (scriptural conduct), then they are liable for the "Prāyaścitta" of four "Guru" (teachers). Similarly, if someone practices "Prājñāvyavahāra" (conduct based on wisdom) while "Śrutavyavahāra" is applicable, or "Yājñāvyavahāra" (conduct based on rituals) while "Dharṇāvyavahāra" is applicable, or "Dharṇāvyavahāra" while "Jītavyavahāra" is applicable, they are all liable for the "Prāyaścitta" of four "Guru" (teachers).

The "Vyavahārapañcaka" (five types of conduct) can only be practiced in a sequential order, starting from the beginning and moving forward. Practicing them in reverse order is strictly prohibited. An "Āgamavyavahārī" (one who follows the "Āgama") should only practice "Āgamavyavahāra" and not any other conduct based on "Śruta" (scripture) or other sources. This is because when the sun shines, there is no need for the light of a lamp.

"Just as good qualities are desirable, so is the conduct that is beneficial. This is what is said about the twelve types of conduct." - "Vyavahāra" (conduct) "Uttara" (chapter) 10, "Bhāṣya" (commentary) "Gāthā" (verse) 724.

"What is beneficial is not to be practiced by those who are not worthy. What is beneficial for the worthy is to be practiced by them." - "Vyavahāra" (conduct) "Uttara" (chapter) 10, "Bhāṣya" (commentary) "Gāthā" (verse) 715.

"Whatever "Prāyaścitta" (penance) is not contrary to the established tradition, and whatever is beneficial for many, that is indeed "Jītakalpa" (conduct based on "Jīta")." - "Vyavahāra" (conduct) "Bhāṣya" (commentary) "Pībikā" (commentary) "Gāthā" (verse) 12.

"What is beneficial for the worthy, but is practiced by those who are careless and distracted, even if it is practiced by many, is not to be practiced by the worthy. What is beneficial for the worthy, given with enthusiasm and devotion, even if practiced by one person, is to be practiced by the worthy." - "Vyavahāra" (conduct) "Uttara" (chapter) 10, "Bhāṣya" (commentary) "Gāthā" (verse) 720, 721.

"The conduct of a Jina (as long as the fourfold assembly exists) remains / Other conduct ceases. If the conduct of a non-Jain causes violence to living beings in grain, juice, fruit, and flowers, then purification is achieved by licking ghee. If one steals cotton, silk, wool, one-hoofed and two-hoofed animals, birds, fragrant substances, medicines, and ropes, etc., then purification is achieved by drinking milk for three days. A Brahmin who has memorized the Rig Veda, even if he kills all three worlds or eats anywhere, does not incur any sin. In the summer, one should perform the five-fire penance, in the rainy season, one should sit in the shade of a tree during the rain, and in the autumn, one should wear wet clothes - in this way, one should gradually increase the penance. / "The terms 'vyavahari', 'vyavaharajna', and 'vyavaharta' are synonymous. One who is dear to Dharma, firm in Dharma, detached, fearful of sin, knowledgeable of the meaning of the sutras, and free from attachment and aversion (impartial) is a 'vyavahari'. If one gives the atonement prescribed by the Agamas according to the transgression, considering the substance, place, time, feeling, the person who is a devotee of transgression, and the contemplation of counter-service, then the 'vyavaharajna' (giver of atonement) is a devotee. 1.

"A practitioner (penitent) who performs minor and major penances with attachment and aversion, without contemplating the substance, field, etc., is contradictory." The practices to be performed are non-scriptural. These are of many types. There are four types of non-scriptural: 1. It is one-time but heavy-karma, therefore it is a non-worshipper of Dharma. 2. It is one-time and light-karma, therefore it is a worshipper of Dharma. 3. It is one-time and heavy-karma, therefore it is a non-worshipper of Dharma. 4. It is one-time and light-karma, therefore it is a worshipper of Dharma. Similarly, there are four types of non-scriptural women. There are five types of non-scriptural: 1. Pulaka - whose disciplined life is like straw, without essence. Although he has faith in the truth, he also performs rituals, but he also uses the benefits obtained from penance and maintains a conduct that seems like knowledge transgression. 2. Bakusha - these are of two types: instrument-bakusha and body-bakusha. One who is engaged in decorating instruments and body and desires prosperity and fame. He consumes transgressions worthy of hole penance. 3. Kushil - this is of two types: 1. Pratisevna Kushil and 2. Kashaya Kushil. Pratisevna Kushil who transgresses in the post-qualities like Pindashuddhi etc. Kashaya Kushil - who is not able to remain stable in his natural state due to the occasional rise of passionate passions. 4. Nimranth - pacified-delusion non-scriptural. 5. Graduate, Yogikevali and Ayogikevali. There are many varieties of these five non-scriptural. All these are practicable. As long as the knowledge of the first restraint and fourteen previous births remained, the aforementioned ten penances were given. Their 1. Gaha who is self-controlled, he knows the truth and the subtle. In the cycle of conduct, he is the measure of the good. The cycle of conduct is the ultimate subtle of conduct.

When a person becomes *vichchhanna* (disqualified), the *anavastapya* and *paranchik* pratyaschitta are also *vichchhanna* - meaning these two pratyaschitta are not given. The remaining eight pratyaschitta are given until *tirtha* (the fourfold sangha). *Pulaka* was given six pratyaschitta until *vyutsarma*. *Pratisevaka-bakusha* and *pratisevaka-kushila* are given all ten pratyaschitta. *Sthaviras* are not given *anavastapya* and *paranchik* pratyaschitta; the remaining eight pratyaschitta are given. *Nirgrantha* can only be given two pratyaschitta - 1 *alocana*, 2 *viveka*. A *snataka* only takes one pratyaschitta - *viveka*. They are not given any pratyaschitta. 

1. Those with *samayikacharitra* are given eight pratyaschitta without *ched* and *mula*. 2. Those with *chedopasthapaniyacharitra* are given all ten pratyaschitta. 3. Those with *parihara-vishuddhi-charitra* are given *path* pratyaschitta until *mula*. 4. Those with *sukshma-samparaya-charitra* and 5. those with *yathakyata-charitra* are given only two pratyaschitta - 1 *alocana* and 2 *viveka*. All these are practical. 

When a *vyavaharajna* (knowledgeable in *vyavahar*) uses a *vyavahar* (conduct) from the five *vyavahar* with a *vyavahartabya* (a monk or nun who is eligible for *vyavahar*), then the *vyavahar* word becomes synonymous with the *tapas* (austerity) in the form of *pratyaschitta*. Therefore, a brief introduction to *tapas* in the form of *pratyaschitta* is given here. 

1. *Guruk*, 2. *Laguk*, 3. *Lagusvak*. There are three types of *guruk* - 1. *Guruk*, 2. *Gurutarak*, and 3. *Yathaguruk*.

4. Thirty days have ten *Chhut* (breaks) with twenty days of *Tapascharya* and ten days of *Parana*.
5. Thirteen days of *Tapascharya* and twelve days of *Parana*. The last *Parana* day is not included here.

**Vyavahar (Prayaschitta) Ko Upadeyata**

**Question:** Bhagwan! What is the benefit of Prayaschitta to a Jiva? 

**Answer:** Prayaschitta purifies the sinful karma and makes the character pure. By performing Prayaschitta in the right way, the path (Samyagdarshan) and the fruit of the path (knowledge) are purified. The conduct and the fruit of conduct (Mokshamarg) are purified.

## Types of Atonement (Prayschitta)

1. **Jnana Prayschitta:** Atonement for transgressions of knowledge, achieved through self-criticism and other means.
2. **Darshan Prayschitta:** Atonement for transgressions of perception, achieved through self-criticism and other means.
3. **Charitra Prayschitta:** Atonement for transgressions of conduct, achieved through self-criticism and other means.
4. **Viyatt Kicchapaayachchitte:** This fourth type of atonement has two interpretations:
    * **Viyattkicchapaayachchitte:** Atonement for explicit actions.
        * This has two meanings:
            * **Explicit:** The atonement act prescribed by the Acharya is the remedy for the sin. This means that when an Acharya prescribes atonement, they consider the transgressor's possessions, location, time, and emotions. The atonement prescribed by the Acharya may or may not be mentioned in the Dashakalapa-Vyavahar, but it will still purify the soul.
            * **Explicit:** Atonement acts clearly specified in the sutras.
    * **Chiyattkicchapaayachchitte:** Atonement for abandoned actions.
        * **Chiyatt:** This word also means "pleasing." Acts pleasing to the Acharya, such as repentance, are also forms of atonement.

**Ten Types of Atonement:**

1. **Palochana Yogya:** Atonement for transgressions that can be purified through self-criticism.
2. **Atikrama:** Transgression of fundamental principles.
3. **Vyatikrama:** Transgression of secondary principles.
4. **Atichara:** Transgression of rules.
5. **Anaacharasevi:** Transgression of ethical conduct.

**Punishment vs. Atonement:**

* Punishment is harsh, while atonement is relatively gentle.
* Punishment is accepted unwillingly, while atonement is accepted willingly.
* Punishment suppresses desires, while atonement mitigates them.

**Number of Transgressions:**

* **Jnana:** 14 transgressions
* **Darshan:** 5 transgressions
* **Charitra:** 106 transgressions
    * 25 transgressions from the five great vows
    * 2 transgressions from abstaining from nighttime meals
    * 4 transgressions from Iryasamiti
    * 2 transgressions from Bhashasamiti
    * 47 transgressions from Eshan asamiti
    * 2 transgressions from Adan Nikshepanasamiti
    * 10 transgressions from Paristhapanasamiti
    * 9 transgressions from the three Guptis
    * 5 transgressions from Sanlekhana

**Note:** The Sanskrit equivalent of "Chiyatt" meaning "pleasing" is not found. (Source: Ardhamagadhi Kosh, Part 2, Chiyatt word, page 628 [27])

## Translation:

**(1)** **Aalochana Yogya:**  A transgression that is worthy of **Aalochana** (criticism) is a type of **Prayaschitta** (atonement). Transgressions of the **Eshana Samiti** (committee for guidance) and **Paristhapana Samiti** (committee for establishment) are often worthy of **Aalochana**.

**(2)** **Pratikramna Yogya:** Transgressions that can be purified through **Pratikramna** (confession and repentance) are **Pratikramna Yogya**. Transgressions of the **Samitis** and **Guptis** (secret keepers) are often **Pratikramna Yogya**.

**(3)** **Ubhay Yogya:** Transgressions that can be purified through both **Aalochana** and **Pratikramna** are **Ubhay Yogya**. Transgressions committed by misidentifying **Ekendirya** (one-sensed) and other beings, or by causing them to migrate, are **Ubhay Yogya**.

**(4)** **Viveka Yogya:** Transgressions that can be purified through **Viveka** (discernment) or **Parityaag** (renunciation) are **Viveka Yogya**. Renouncing **Adhakarma Aahar** (food taken without proper consideration) is **Viveka Yogya**.

**(5)** **Vyutsarga Yogya:** Transgressions that can be purified by restraining bodily actions and stabilizing the mind on the **Dhyeya** (goal) are **Vyutsarga Yogya**. **Kayotsarga** (restraint of bodily actions) performed after crossing a river is **Vyutsarga Yogya**.

**(6)** **Tapa Yogya:** Transgressions that can be purified only through **Tapa** (austerity) are **Tapa Yogya**. Transgressions mentioned in the **Nishith Sutra** are often **Tapa Yogya** (**Murumas** or **Laghumas**).

**(7)** **Chheda Yogya:** Transgressions that can be purified through **Diksha Chheda** (breaking of initiation) are **Chheda Yogya**. Some transgressions of the **Five Great Vows** are **Chheda Yogya**.

**(8)** **Mool Yogya:** Transgressions that can be purified only by re-accepting the **Mahavratas** (Great Vows) are **Mool Yogya**. Transgressions involving one or more **Mahavratas** are **Mool Yogya**.

**(9)** **Anvasthapya Yogya:** Transgressions that can be purified only by renouncing the **Vratas** (vows) and **Vesh** (attire) are **Anvasthapya Yogya**. Transgressions like indulging in **Aakarna Apavad** (unjustified criticism), repeatedly committing a transgression, or committing multiple transgressions simultaneously are **Chheda Yogya**. Just as an infected limb is amputated to protect the rest of the body, similarly, a corrupted vow is renounced to protect the remaining vows.

**(2)**  Those who kill one or more **Panchendriya Pranis** (five-sensed beings), violate **Sheel** (conduct), speak **Mrishvad** (falsehood) with a deliberate and impure mind, engage in **Adattadan** (taking without giving), possess **Parigraha** (attachment), wear **Par-Ling** (attire of a renunciant) or **Grihasthalin** (attire of a householder) are **Mool Yogya**.

**(3)** There are three types of **Anvasthapya Yogya** transgressions:
    1. Stealing from a **Sadhmik** (fellow Jain)
    2. Stealing from **Anyarmis** (non-Jains)
    3. Striking with a stick, fist, or other weapon.

(10) **Parāṃcīka**-worthy transgressions, which can only be purified by adopting the garb of a householder and performing the prescribed austerities for a very long time, are **Parāṃcīka**-penance worthy. A person undergoing this penance is expelled from the shelter, village, and country. The main reasons for penance are: 1. **Atikrama** - the intention to commit a transgression / 2. **Vyatikrama** - collecting the means to commit a transgression / 3. **Atichāra** - beginning to commit a transgression. 4. **Anāchāra** - committing a transgression. There are three types of **Atikrama**: 1. **Atikrama** of knowledge, 2. **Atikrama** of perception, 3. **Atikrama** of conduct. Similarly, there are **Vyatikrama**, **Atichāra**, and **Anāchāra** of knowledge. There are also three types each of perception and conduct. **Atikrama** of knowledge is of three types: 1. **Jaghanya**, 2. **Madhyama**, 3. **Utkṛṣṭa**. Similarly, there are **Vyatikrama**, **Atichāra**, and **Anāchāra** of knowledge. There are also three types each of perception and conduct. If **Atikrama** of knowledge, etc. has occurred, then one should criticize oneself before the guru, perform **pratikramāṇa**, and purify oneself by means of censure, deep reflection, etc., make a firm resolve not to commit the transgression again, and perform penance in the form of austerity. Similarly, one should purify **Vyatikrama**, etc. of knowledge, and **Atikrama**, etc. of perception and conduct. 1. **Ṭhāṇaṃ** 6, **Sū** 489 / **Ṭhāṇaṃ** 8, **Sū** 605 / **Ṭhāṇaṃ** 9, **Sū** 688 / **Ṭhāṇaṃ** 10, **Sū** 733 / There are five **Parāṃcīka**-penance worthy transgressions: 1. One who creates discord among those in the same lineage (**gaccha**). 2. One who creates discord among those in the same group (**gaṇa**). 3. One who is inclined towards violence. 4. One who is a fault-finder. 5. One who repeatedly uses the **praśnaśāstra**. - **Ṭhāgaṃ** 5, **U** 1 **Sū** 398 / There are three **Parāṃcīka**-penance worthy transgressions: 1. **Duṣṭa** **Parāṃcīka** 2. **Pramatta** **Parāṃcīka** 3. **Anyo'nya** **Maithanasevī** **Parāṃcīka** / For specific knowledge regarding **Anvavasthāpya** and **Parāṃcīka** penance, one should refer to the **Vyavahāra Bhāṣya**. 2. (a) **Ṭhāṇaṃ** 3 **U** 4 **Sū** 195 / (b) To resolve to study during the time of non-study is **Atikrama** of knowledge / To go to get a book is **Vyatikrama** of knowledge / To begin studying is **Atichāra** of knowledge. To complete the study is **Anāchāra** of knowledge. Similarly, one should understand **Atikrama**, etc. of perception and conduct. [29]

## Ten Types of Consumption (Pratisevna)

1. **Darp Pratisevna:** Consumption of non-virtuous food with ego.
2. **Pramad Pratisevna:** Consumption of non-virtuous food due to five types of negligence (like sleepiness).
3. **Anabhog Pratisevna:** Consumption of virtuous food unwillingly due to forgetfulness.
4. **Pratur Pratisevna:** Consumption of non-virtuous food during illness.
5. **Apatti Pratisevna:** Consumption of non-virtuous food due to reasons like famine.
6. **Sankit Pratisevna:** Consumption of virtuous food with doubt.
7. **Sahsaakar Pratisevna:** Consumption of virtuous food suddenly or forcefully.
8. **Bhay Pratisevna:** Consumption of non-virtuous food due to fear.
9. **Pravas Pratisevna:** Consumption of non-virtuous food due to hatred.
10. **Vimarsh Pratisevna:** Consumption of virtuous food for testing a disciple.

These types of consumption are broadly classified into two: **Dapika** and **Kalpika**.

**Dapika Pratisevna:** Consumption of non-virtuous food with attachment and aversion. The consumer becomes **viraadhak** (one who hinders spiritual progress).

**Kalpika Pratisevna:** Consumption of virtuous food without attachment and aversion, or consumption that happens due to circumstances. The consumer becomes **araadhak** (one who helps spiritual progress).

## Six Types of Knowledge Transgression (Jnana Atichaar)

1. **Kala Atichaar:** Studying scriptures at an inappropriate time.
2. **Vinaya Atichaar:** Not respecting the teacher's instructions due to pride in one's caste or lineage while studying scriptures.
3. **Bahuman Atichaar:** Not respecting the scriptures and the teacher.
4. **Upadhana Atichaar:** Engaging in activities like scratching or applying ointment while reciting scriptures.
5. **Nihnava Abhidhana Atichaar:** Hiding the teacher's name.
6. **Vyanjana Atichaar:** Pronouncing more or fewer syllables than required.
7. **Artha Atichaar:** Not understanding the meaning of the scriptures in context, or understanding it in a contrary way.
8. **Ubhaya Atichaar:** Pronouncing a short vowel as long, or a long vowel as short. Pronouncing an accented syllable as unaccented, or an unaccented syllable as accented.

**Atikram, Vyatikrama, and Atichaar** are three types of transgressions that arise from the influence of the three passions (sanjvalana kshaya). They are purified through various types of atonement, starting from **Aalocana** (self-reflection) and ending with **Tapoham** (intense penance).

**Chhed, Mula, Anvasthapy, and Paranchik** are four types of transgressions that are eligible for atonement. They arise from the influence of the remaining twelve passions (Anantanubandhi 4, Apratyakhyani 4, Pratyakhyani 4).

**Quotes:**

1. "**Gaaha raagaddosaanugaya, tu dappiya kappiya tu tadbhaava. Praaraadhana u kappe, viraadhana hoti dappeṇ**" - Brihadkatha Upadesha 4, Bhashya Matha 4943.
2. "**Savve vi aiyaara sanjalanaaṇam udayo honti**" - Abhidhana Kosha, 'Aiyaar' word.

---------------------------
There are four types of Shramanas who consume the four types of faults: Atikrama, Vyatikrama, Atichar and Anachar, which are both manifest and concealed. 

1. Some Shramanas consume these faults openly, i.e., they do not conceal them.
2. Some Shramanas consume these faults in a concealed manner, i.e., they do not reveal them.
3. Some Shramanas consume these faults both openly and in a concealed manner.
4. Some Shramanas do not consume these faults either openly or in a concealed manner.

Those who fall into the first category are not disciplined, are undisciplined, free-willed, deceitful and shameless, and they are not afraid of sin, therefore they consume faults openly.

Those who fall into the second category are of two types:

* Those with a clear understanding, if they consume these faults occasionally, they conceal them because they themselves consume faults due to weakness of the soul, therefore they think that other Shramanas should not consume faults by seeing them consume faults, therefore they conceal the consumption of faults.
* Those with an unclear understanding, who are deceitful Shramanas, do not consume these faults openly out of fear of public shame or with the intention that the faith of the devotees should remain on them, but they do so in secret.

Those who fall into the third category are of a deceitful nature, they consume ordinary faults openly but conceal powerful faults. If someone sees them consuming ordinary faults, they say, "Ordinary faults are common to all in this five-fold time. Therefore, it is impossible to avoid these faults."

Those who fall into the fourth category are truly detached, are seekers of liberation and are devoted to self-study, therefore they do not consume these faults either openly or in a concealed manner.

The practice of atonement as prescribed in the Vyavahar Sutra is for the purification of the faults consumed by the first three categories of Shramanas. The last, fourth category of Shramanas are the keepers of the Niratichar character, therefore there is no provision for any kind of atonement for them.

The purification of conduct is both difficult and easy. In the Dharma-shastra of the first Tirthankara, Bhagwan Rishabhdev Adinath, the Shramanas were mostly righteous and simple, but they were dull (those with low intellectual development). Therefore, they were not able to fully understand and follow the principles of the Sutra. This was the only reason why their conduct was difficult to purify.

Page #33:
---------------------------
The 22 Tirthankaras (from Bhagwan Ajitanatha to Bhagwan Parshvanatha) and their Shraman-Shramani were mostly righteous and wise (simple and enlightened). They were always striving to have complete knowledge and complete adherence to the principles laid down in the Sutras. Therefore, their conduct was very simple. The Shraman-Shramani of the last Tirthankara, Bhagwan Mahavira, are mostly crooked and dull. Even though they have detailed knowledge of the Shruta, including Dasha, Kalpa, and Vyavahar, each Gachch presents a different interpretation of the principles. The observance of great religious festivals like Paryushana Parva and Samvatsari Parva, Pakkhi, and Chaumasi Alochana are also performed on different days. Due to their crookedness and dullness, they do not readily criticize the transgressions that occur in the Mulaguna and Uttargana. Therefore, their conduct is very difficult to purify. 

Palochana and Alochak: Alochana is the act of revealing transgressions (which occur due to ignorance, ego, carelessness, or circumstances) to the Guru. An Alochak is one who reveals the transgressions that have occurred due to the aforementioned reasons to the Guru. If the Alochak is deceitful and performs Palochana deceitfully, then he will not receive good results from the Alochana. If the Alochak is not deceitful and performs Alochana without deceit, then he will receive good results from the Alochana. 

It is essential to criticize transgressions for the purification of conduct and the purification of the self (Atma). However, there are different categories of seekers. One category does not criticize transgressions at all. They say, "We have committed transgressions (Akruti), we are committing them, and we will continue to commit them. Because the country, time, and physical-mental conditions are such that our disciplined life cannot be free from transgressions. It is not possible for us, so what is the benefit of Alochana? It is like the process of bathing an elephant. Transgressions occur, we criticize them, and then transgressions occur again. This cycle continues." Their thinking is unwise because if we wear clothes, we wear them, and we will continue to wear them, then the clothes we wear are soiled, they are soiled, and they will continue to be soiled. Then what is the benefit of purifying the clothes? How can this be considered appropriate? As long as we wear clothes, it is our duty to keep them clean. Because there are many benefits to purifying clothes - clothes that are purified daily do not become soiled, and clean clothes also contribute to good health. 

Similarly, as long as the activities of the Yogas are present and the Kshayas are intense or mild, the accumulation of Karmic dirt due to transgressions is certain.

Page #34:
---------------------------
Constantly criticizing transgressions does not purify the soul from karmic impurities and keeps it in a state of emotional distress. As the practice of yoga is obstructed and the passions become weaker, the occurrence of transgressions becomes less frequent. The second category is those who do not criticize transgressions out of fear of disgrace, reproach, censure, or condemnation, or out of fear of losing fame, reputation, or worship and respect. The third category is those who criticize but do so hypocritically. They think, "If I don't criticize, my present life will be ruined and my future life will also be miserable. If I criticize, my present and future life will be prosperous, or if I criticize, I will attain knowledge, vision, and good conduct." The scriptures prescribe double penance for hypocritical critics. The fourth category is those who criticize without hypocrisy. They are: 1. well-born, 2. of noble lineage, 3. humble, 4. knowledgeable, 5. insightful, 6. virtuous, 7. forgiving, 8. self-controlled, 9. free from attachment, 10. free from regret. This is the category of such seekers. Their conduct and conviction are both pure. Whether the critic is a seeker of liberation or not, they should always criticize in front of a seeker of liberation. In the absence of a seeker of liberation, in front of whom should they criticize? There is a sequence for this, which can be known by studying the Chhedasutras. Why is the editing of the Vyavaharsutra the ultimate goal of the life of restrained souls? - "Purity of conviction," that is, complete liberation of the soul (from karmic impurities), and for this, the purity of conduct prescribed by the Vyavaharsutra is essential. Just as physical health requires purification of the stomach, and purification of the stomach requires purification of food, similarly, spiritual well-being requires purity of conviction, and purity of conviction requires purity of conduct. Because without purity of conduct, purity of conviction is absolutely impossible. In worldly life, transactions are conducted only with those who are honest (in giving and taking money). Similarly, in spiritual life, actions like worship and veneration are performed only with a seeker of pure conduct. 1.

The conduct of restrained souls is purified (free from the stain of sin arising from transgression) by the five conducts expounded in the Vyavahar Sutra. Some thoughts have been expressed for the Chhed Sutras published in the Granth. In this writing, I have included essential excerpts from the Ayara Dasha, Kappasuttam Chhed Sutras edited by me earlier, Pandit Ratna Muni Shri Vijaymuniji Shastri's "Prachar Dasha: An Exercise" and Upadhyay Muni Shri Phoolchandji 'Shraman's "Brihat Kalpasutra Ki Uththanika". For this, I express my heartfelt gratitude to both the Munis. The work of writing detailed discussions etc. has been done by Shri Tilockmuniji M.

## Introduction: Three Chhed Sutras: A Critical Study

The place of the Vedas in the Vedic tradition, the Tripitaka in the Buddhist tradition, the Bible in Christianity, and the Quran in Islam is the same as that of the Agam literature in the Jain tradition. The significant difference between the Vedas and the Buddhist and Jain Agam literature is that the sages of the Vedic tradition emphasized the protection of words, while the Jain and Buddhist traditions emphasized the meaning. This is why the words of the Vedas have been largely preserved, but they have not been able to establish a consensus on meaning. The Jain and Buddhist traditions have been completely opposite in this regard. There, the protection of meaning has been emphasized, and meaning has been considered more important than words. This is why there are variations in the texts of the Agams, but there is rarely a difference in meaning. The words of the Vedas have been imbued with mantras, which has preserved the words but destroyed their meaning. The Jain Agam literature, not being imbued with mantra power, has preserved the meaning completely. The Vedas do not represent the views of any particular sage, while the Jain Ganipitaka and the Buddhist Tripitaka represent the words of Lord Mahavira and the Tathagata Buddha respectively. The Tirthankaras have been the formulators of the meaning of the Jain Agams, and the Ganadharas have been the authors of the Sutras. The culture of the Jain and Vedic traditions has been distinct. The folk culture is primarily spiritual. The Jain Agams have primarily resonated with a spiritual tone, while the Vedas have expressed a worldly tone. It should not be forgotten that the things mentioned in the Jain Agams about atomic science, biology, botany, etc., two thousand five hundred years ago, are still astonishing to scientists today. The Jain Agam... literature has been important from many perspectives. Some time ago, there was a belief among Western and Eastern scholars that the Vedas were the original source of the Agams and the Tripitaka, but the ruins found in the excavations of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa have radically changed the scholars' belief that the culture that existed in India before the arrival of the Aryans was fully developed and it was a Shraman culture. Impartial thinkers have unanimously accepted the fact that the Vedic tradition has accepted the five great vows of non-violence, truth, non-stealing, celibacy, and non-possession due to the influence of the Shraman culture. Today, the Vedic... [35]

---------------------------
The description of ahimsa and other principles in tradition is a contribution of Jain culture. The word 'Agam' has many meanings. I have discussed it in detail. In Acharang, the word 'Pagam' is used in the sense of knowing. "Agametta-Anavizza"2 means to know and be wise. One who knows the brevity of Agam is called 'Laghavanga Agammane'. In Vyavahar Bhashya, Sanghadasagani, while describing Pragam-Vyavahar, has divided it into two categories: direct and indirect. Direct includes Avadhi, Manaparyav and Keval knowledge, and indirect includes fourteen previous and lesser Shruta knowledge. This also makes it clear that knowledge is Pragam. The teachings given by the omniscient and all-seeing Tirthankaras are also Pragam because they are knowledge. In Bhagavati, Anuyogadwar and Sthanang, the word Pragam is used in the sense of scripture. There, four types of evidence are mentioned: Pratyaksha, Anuman, Upaman and Pragam. Pragam is also divided into two categories: Laukik and Lokottar. Laukik Pagam includes Bharat, Ramayana etc., and Lokottar Pagam includes Achar, Sutrakrut etc. Lokottar Agam is also divided into three categories: Suttagam, Aththagam and Tadubhayagam. From another perspective, there are three types of Agam: Pratmagam, Anantaragam and Paramparagam. There are two types of Agam: Arthrup and Sutrap. Tirthankar Prabhu teaches Arthrup Pragam, hence Arthrup Gram is called Pratmagam of Tirthankaras, because it is their own Arthagam, they have not taken it from anyone else, but the same Arthagam has been received by the Ganadharas from the Tirthankaras. There is no interference of any third person between Ganadhar and Tirthankar, hence for Ganadharas, that Arthagam is called Anantaragam, but based on that Arthagam, Ganadharas themselves create Sutra-rup. Therefore, Sutragam is called Pratmagam for Ganadharas. The direct disciples of Ganadharas receive Sutragam directly from Ganadharas, there is no interference between them. Therefore, for those disciples, Sutragam is Anantaragam, but Arthagam is Paramparagam. Because they received it from their Dharma Guru Ganadharas. But this was not Pratmagam for Ganadharas. They received it from Tirthankaras. The disciples of Ganadharas and 1. Four Chapters of Culture: p. 125 - Ramdhari Singh "Dinakar" 2. Pracharang 124 Jnatva Prajnapayet 3.

In their tradition, the sutras and their meanings are passed down through a lineage of disciples and students. The Ganadharas compiled the sacred discourses of the Lord Mahavira in the form of sutras, which became known as the Anga literature. It has twelve divisions: Achar, Sutra-krit, Sthan, Samavay, Bhagavati, Jnata, Upasaka-dasha, Antakrid-dasha, Anuttaroppapatik, Prasnavyakaran, Vipak, and Drishtibad. Drishtibad is a division of the earlier literature. Based on the Arhad-bhasit matrikapadas, the Ganadharas created fourteen scriptures, which contain the essence of the entire Shruta. These fourteen scriptures are known as the fourteen Purvas. The analytical method of these Purvas is extremely complex, so only those great sadhakas who were endowed with exceptional intelligence could understand them. For ordinary sadhakas and for the benefit of women, the Dvadasangi was created. Acharya Jinabhadragani Kshamasraman wrote that the study of Drishtibad was not suitable for women. Because women are of a frivolous nature, they are easily proud. Their senses are fickle. Their intellect is weaker than that of men. Therefore, the study of Drishtibad, with its excessive miracles and wonders, is not for them. The Maladhari Acharya Hemchandra, in explaining this topic, wrote that if women were to study Drishtibad, their frivolous nature would lead them to develop egotism, thinking, "I am a student of Drishtibad," which would lead them to despise and scorn men, causing their downfall. Therefore, the great compassionate Tirthankaras, who are the embodiments of mercy, prohibited women from studying Drishtibad and other studies that involve excessive miracles and wonders. The Brihatkalpaniyukti also mentions this. What Jinabhadragani Kshamasraman and Maladhari Hemchandra wrote about the distorted nature and weak intellect of women does not seem entirely accurate. These things are also possible in men. Many women are more intelligent and serious than men. This is clear from the descriptions found in the scriptures. 

**Note:** The Jain terms have been preserved in the translation.

When a woman can attain the highest spiritual position of a Tirthankara, and can acquire Kevala Jnana, then wise people should contemplate with an impartial perspective on the weaknesses pointed out for the study of Drashtivad, and the weaknesses due to which women were not considered eligible for Drashtivad. In my view, the knowledge of the previous literature was attainable. To acquire that knowledge, only study and reading were not enough, some specific practices were also mandatory for the seeker. For those practices, the seeker had to stay alone in a secluded and peaceful place for some time. The physical body of women is not such that they can stay alone in seclusion and perform long practices. From this perspective, the study of Drashtivad was prohibited for women. This is more rational and logical. In my view, this is also the reason for the non-availability of the Aharaksharir of women. Based on the Anga texts compiled by the Ganadharas, other sthaviras later created texts, which are called Angabahya. Anga and Angabahya, these Agam texts are the fundamental pillars of the reign of Bhagwan Mahavira. They are the key to Jain conduct, the unique treasure of Jain thought, the dignity of people's culture, and the glory of Jain literature. It should be remembered that the process of including Angabahya texts in the Agam has not been the same in both the Svetambar and Digambar traditions. In the Digambar tradition, the number of Angabahya Agams is very small, but in the Svetambars, this tradition continued for a long time, which resulted in a larger number of Angabahya texts. It is very important that the various studies of Praavashyak, Dashavakalik, Uttaradhyayanasutra, and Nishita, etc., are equally accepted in both traditions. The Svetambar scholars believe that the original form of Agam literature has been lost to a great extent, but not completely, it still remains. In the three compilations of Angas and Angabahya Bhagams, there has definitely been some change in its original form. Later events and deliberations have also been included. For example, the description of seven Nihnvas and Navaganas in the Stananga. The subject hinted at in the Prashnavyakaran is not available at present, however, most of the Agams are original, completely original. From the perspective of language and style of writing, it is very ancient. Present-day linguists consider the first Shrutaskandha of Acharanga and the first Shrutaskandha of Sutrakrutanga to be two thousand five hundred years old. They also consider Stananga, Bhagavati, Uttaradhyayanasutra, Dashavakalik, Nishita, and Kalpa to be ancient. There is no doubt that the original of the Pragam is still preserved. From the perspective of the Digambar tradition, the Anga literature has been lost. Therefore, they created new texts and considered them as evidence like the Agams. The Digambar tradition does not consider the Pragam literature of the Svetambars as evidence, and the Svetambar tradition does not consider the texts of the Digambar tradition as valid, but when I contemplate with an impartial perspective, it is clear that there is no significant difference in the original perspective of the Pragam texts of both traditions. The philosophical views, Jiva views, Karma views, Lok views, and Jnana views are the same in both Pragam texts. There is no difference from a philosophical perspective. Even if we contemplate from the perspective of the conduct tradition, there is no significant difference even though there are some differences regarding the use of clothes. The texts of the Digambar tradition emphasize nudity, but in practice, the number of naked monks has been very small, and the number of Digambar Bhattarakas, etc.

The Jain Kalpa was given more importance than the Sthavirakalpa in the Svetambara Pragama literature, but from a practical perspective, it was prohibited after the Aryajambhu. The Digambara tradition prohibits women from attaining liberation, but the Digambara tradition-accepted Shatkhandagama states that human women are adequately present in the Samyagmithyadristi, Asanyatasamyagdristi, Sanyatasanyata, and Sanyata Gunasthanas.  In this, the word "Sanjad" is given in a note by the editors, the gist of which is that a human woman cannot be in the "Sanyata" Gunasthana, and upon being in the Sanyata Gunasthana, a woman can attain liberation.  A strong atmosphere of opposition arose in the Digambara community regarding this question, then the editors of the text, Pandit Heerlalji Jain, etc., again explained it in the "Preface to the Third Part of the Pakhandagama," but when scholars saw the original copy of the Pakhandagama in Moodbidri (Karnataka), the word "Sanjad" was found in it as well.  Vadakaraswami, in his Mulachar, analyzes the conduct of the Prayikas, saying that the sadhus or Dharayikas who conduct themselves in this way attain worship, fame, and happiness in the world, and attain liberation.  This also mentions the Prayikas attaining liberation.  However, later commentators prohibited women's liberation in their commentaries.  Of all the rules of conduct, the most important rule is that of intended renunciation, which has been equally important in both traditions.  In the Svetambara Pragama literature and its explanatory literature, there is a special description of the exceptional path regarding conduct, but there is no description of exceptions in the Digambara tradition, but upon deep reflection, it appears that there must have been exceptions in the Digambara tradition as well.  If there were no exceptions from the beginning, how would the name of Nishita appear in the list of Angavahy?  In the Svetambara tradition, the study of exceptions has been prohibited for everyone by codifying them.  Only a Shraman with special qualifications is considered eligible to read them.  The number of Svetambara Shramans has been very high from the beginning, which led to the creation of Chhedasutras for the proper functioning of society.  The Chhedasutras explain the hidden secrets and subtle activities of Shramanachar.  Many favorable and unfavorable situations arise in the life of a Shraman, the Chhedasutras tell how to make decisions in such difficult situations.  The description of rules and sub-rules regarding conduct, as is available in the Chhedasutras in the Jain tradition, is also found in the Vinayapitaka in the Buddhist tradition, and in the Kalpasutra, Shrotasutra, and Grihasutras in the Vedic tradition.  Chhedasutras were also created in the Digambara tradition, but they are not available today.  The Chhedasutra is not mentioned in the Mandisutra.  The first use of "Chhedasutra" is in Praavshakanyukti 16.

It is green. 18 After that, this word has also been used in *VisheshAvashyakBhashya* and *NishithBhashya*. The implication is that if we consider *AvashyakNiyukti* to be the work of the brother of the astrologer Varahamihira, the second Bhadrabaahu, then he lived in the sixth century Vikram. He has used it. It is clear that the word "Chhedasutta" was used before "Mulasutta". Why were certain *Pragamas* given the name "Chhedasutra"? The answer to this question is not directly and clearly available in ancient texts. However, it is clear that the sutras that have been called "Chhedasutta" are *Prayashchitta* sutras. In *Sthananga*, five *charitras* are mentioned for the *Shramanas* (1) *Samayik*, (2) *Chhedopasthapaniya*, (3) *PariharVishuddhi*, (4) *SookshmaSamparaya*, (5) *Yayakhyata* / 22 Of these, the last three *charitras* have become extinct in the present time. The *Samayik* *charitra* is short-lived, the *Chhedopasthapanik* *charitra* lasts for life. *Prayashchitta* is also related to this *charitra*. It is possible that the *Prayashchitta* sutras were given the name *Chhedasutra* keeping this *charitra* in mind. In *Malayagiri*’s *AvashyakVritti* 23, the term *pad-vibhaga*, *samachari* has been used for *Chhedasutras*. Both the words *pad-vibhaga* and *Chhed* have been kept. Because in *Chhedasutras*, one sutra is not connected to another sutra. All the sutras are independent. Their interpretation is also done from the *Chhed*-perspective or from the *vibhaga*-perspective. *DashaShrutaSkandha*, *Nishith*, *Vyavahar* and *BrihatKalpa* these sutras have been quoted from the ninth *Pratyakhyana* before, 24 from that, being cut off, i.e., separated, they may have been given the name *Chhedasutra*, this is also possible / 25 *Chhedasutras* have been considered as the best *Shruta*. The *Bhashyakaras* also support this statement. 26 *Chanikara* Jinadas Mahत्तर himself raises this question that why are *Chhedasutras* the best? Then he himself solves it by saying that the *Prayashchitta* method is described in the *sutra*, it purifies the *charitra*, for this reason this *Shruta* is considered the best. 18. *Jan cha Mahakappasuyam, jani asesani Chheasuttani / Charanakarananuprago ti kaliyatthe uvamyani / / -AvashyakNiyukti 777 -VisheshAvashyakBhashya 2265 20.

It has gone. A comprehensive discussion of the practice of the Shraman life is available only in the Cheda Sutras. What are the limitations of the seeker, what is his duty? Such questions have been pondered upon in them. To cut out the element of unrestraint from life, to cleanse the practice of its impurities, to be fully vigilant to avoid mistakes, to take atonement and rectify them if mistakes are made, all this is the work of the Cheda Sutras. / In Samachari Shatak, Time Sundargani has stated the number of Cheda Sutras to be six: (1) Mahanishith, (2) Dasha Shruta Skandha, (3) Vyavahar, (4) Brihat Kalp, (5) Nishith, (6) Jit Kalp / Except for Jit Kalp, the names of the remaining five Sutras are also found in Nandi Sutra. Jit Kalp is the work of Jinbhadragani Kshamasraman, therefore it cannot be placed in the category of Agam. / The present version of Mahanishith is a restoration by Acharya Haribhadra (8th century AD). It had been consumed by termites before that. Therefore, the Mahanishith available today also does not find a place in the category of Agam. Thus, there are only four original Cheda Sutras - (1) Dasha Shruta Skandha, (2) Vyavahar, (3) Brihat Kalp and (4) Nishith / The Jain Agams have been created in two ways (1) Krit, (2) Ni! Hit / The Agams that have been created independently are called Krit Agams. For example, the Dvadasangi was created by the Ganadharas and the Upanga literature was created by different sthaviras, they are all Krit Pagams. Ni! Hit Agams are considered to be - (1) Acharachula (2) Dashakalik (3) Nishith (4) Dasha Shruta Skandha (5) Brihat Kalp (6) Vyavahar (7) Uttaradhyayanas's Parisha Adhyayan. Acharachula has been elaborated by Chaturdashapurvi Bhadrabahu, this fact has become clear through investigation today. The style of composition of Acharachula is completely different from Acharang. It was composed after Acharang. The Acharang-Niyuktikar has considered it to be sthavir. The meaning of sthavir has been given as Ganadhar by Charnikar. 1. Cheyasuyam kamha uttamasuttam?

And the commentator has done the fourteen पूर्वी, but the name of the स्थविर has not come in them. The opinion of the learned is that the word स्थविर here is used for the fourteen पूर्वी भद्रबाहु. To express the profound meaning of the आचारांग, the "आचारचूला" has been created. The commentator has indicated the निर्यहूणस्थल of the five चूला. The दशवकालिक fourteen पूर्वी शय्यंभव has been नि!हण by the various पूर्वो. For example, the fourth study is taken from the आत्मप्रवाद पूर्व, the fifth study from the कर्मप्रवाद पूर्व, the seventh study from the सत्यप्रवाद पूर्व, and the remaining studies are taken from the third वस्तु of the प्रत्याख्यान पूर्व. According to the second opinion, the दशवकालिक गणिपिटक is quoted from the द्वादशांगी. The निशीथ has been नि!हण from the ninth पूर्व called प्रत्याख्यान. The प्रत्याख्यान पूर्व has twenty वस्तु, i.e., अर्थाधिकार. The name of the third वस्तु is आचार. It also has twenty प्राभृतच्छेद, i.e., subdivisions. The निशीथ has been नि'हण from the twentieth प्राभूतच्छेद. According to the पंचकल्पचूणि, the निर्यु हक of निशीथ is भद्रबाहुस्वामी. This opinion has also been supported by the प्रागमप्रभावक मुनिश्री पुण्यविजयजी. 1.

"The Dasha-Shruta-Skandha, Brihat-Kalpa and Vyavahar, all three are considered to be abridged versions of the original fourteen Purvas by Bhadra-Bahu Swami. According to the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha's own statement, the currently available Dasha-Shruta-Skandha is shorter than the original Dasha-Shruta-Skandha found in the Angas. This abridgment was done by the Sthaviras for the benefit of their disciples. According to the Churni, the name of the Sthavira is Bhadra-Bahu.

The second study of the Uttaradhyayanas is also considered to be an Anga-Prabhava. According to Bhadra-Bahu, the author of the abridgment, it is an excerpt from the seventeenth Prabhrit of the Karma-Pravada-Purva. In addition to these, a large part of the extra-Anga literature, especially the Karma literature, is considered to be abridged from the original.

It is important to clarify the meaning of the term "niyuhita" (abridged) in relation to these works. The Tirthankaras are the ones who provide the essence of the meaning, the Sutrakara (author of the Sutras) is Ganadhara, and the ones who are credited with the current abridged form are the ones whose names are inscribed or known. For example, the author of the Dasha-Kalika is Shayambhava, and the author of the Kalpa, Vyavahar, Nishita and Dasha-Shruta-Skandha is Bhadra-Bahu.

Both the Svetambara and Digambara sects agree on the number of Jain Anga literature. They both accept twelve Angas. However, this is not the case with the number of extra-Anga Agamas, as they have different opinions. Some consider the number of Agamas to be 84, some 45, and some 32. The list of Agamas given in the Nandi-Sutras does not include all the Agamas that are currently available. The Svetambara Murtipujak community considers 45 Agamas, including some abridgments along with the original Agamas, while some consider 84. The Stanakvasi and Terapanthi traditions consider only 32 to be authoritative. The Digambara community believes that all the original Agamas have been lost.

The Dasha Shruta Skandha is a Cheda Sutra. The Cheda Sutra has two functions: to protect from faults and to provide atonement for faults committed inadvertently. It contains provisions for avoiding faults. In the Thananga, it is known as Prachar Dasha. The Dasha Shruta Skandha has ten studies, hence its name. The Dasha Shruta Skandha has 1830 Anushtup Shlokas in the available text. There are 216 Gadyasutras and 52 Padya Sutras. The first Uddeshak describes 20 Asamadhi Sthanas. Samadhi is the state of mind that is peaceful and remains on the path of liberation through knowledge, vision, and conduct. Asamadhi is the state of mind that is disturbed and restless, and leads the soul away from the path of liberation through knowledge, vision, and conduct. There are twenty types of Asamadhi. These include: walking quickly, walking at night without worship, performing bodily functions without purpose, disrespecting elders, and slander. These actions lead to Asamadhi in oneself and other beings. The seeker's soul is polluted and their pure conduct is stained. Therefore, it is called Asamadhi Sthan. The second Uddeshak describes 21 Shabal Doshas, which destroy the purity of conduct. When conduct is stained, it becomes impure. Therefore, they are called Shabal Doshas. The word "Shabal" means "colored". Shabal Doshas include: masturbation, touching women, eating and performing actions at night, being a Pradhakarmi, consuming food for a specific purpose, breaking a vow, and consuming Maya Sthan. Conduct becomes Shabal by committing four faults in the Uttargunas, and three faults in the Mulagunas, in addition to Anachar. The third Uddeshak describes 33 types of Ashatanas. The Jain Acharyas have given a beautiful explanation of the word Ashatana. The attainment of spiritual qualities like Samyag Darshan is called "Aaya" and "Shatana" means "destruction". Disrespecting great men like Sadgurudev leads to the destruction of good qualities like Samyag Darshan. The thirty-three types of Ashatanas include: walking, standing, or sitting in front of the Guru, in the same row, or very close to the Guru; speaking to someone else before the Guru; disregarding the Guru's words; not criticizing after returning from begging; and so on. The fourth Uddeshak describes the eight types of Ganisampadas. A community of Shramans is called a Gan. The head of the Gan is called the Gani. The eight types of Ganisampadas are: Prachar Sampada, Shruta Sampada, Sharira Sampada, Vachan Sampada, Vachana Sampada, Mati Sampada, Prayog Mati Sampada, and Sangrah Parijnana Sampada. The four types of Prachar Sampada are: being virtuous and disciplined, being free from ego, being of unsteady nature, and being of old nature (unchanging nature).

Page #46:
---------------------------
The **Shruta Sampada** has four types: **Bahushruta**, **Parichita Shruta**, **Vichitra Shruta**, and **Ghosh Vishuddhikarakta**. The **Sharira Sampada** has four types: **Samyak Anupat** (proper proportion of height and width of the body), **Alajjaspad Sharira** (a body that is not a cause of shame), **Sthir Sangathan** (stable organization), and **Pratipoorna Indriyata** (complete senses). The **Vachan Sampada** has four types: **Pradeyavachan** (speech that is worthy of being received), **Madhur Vachan** (sweet speech), **Anishrit** (unrestricted, without any conditions), and **Asandigdha Vachan** (unambiguous speech). The **Vachana Sampada** has four types: **Vicharpoork Vachya Vishay Ka Uddeshya Nirdeshan** (pointing out the purpose of the subject matter with deliberation), **Vicharpoork Vachan** (reading with deliberation), **Upayukt Vishay Ka Hi Vivechan** (discussing only the appropriate subject), and **Arth Ka Sunishchit Roop Se Nirupan** (representing the meaning in a definite way). The **Mati Sampada** has four types: **Avgrah**, **Iha**, **Avay**, and **Dharana**. 

**Avgrah** has six types: **Kshipragrahan** (quick grasping), **Bahuggrahan** (grasping many things), **Bahuvudhgrahan** (grasping many different things), **Dhravgrahan** (firm grasping), **Anishritgrahan** (unrestricted grasping), and **Asandigdhagrahan** (unambiguous grasping). Similarly, **Iha** and **Avay** also have six types each. **Dharana** has six types: **Bahudharana** (holding many things), **Bahubidhdharana** (holding many different things), **Puratan Dharana** (holding old things), **Durddhar Dharana** (holding things firmly), **Anidhit Dharana** (holding things without any effort), and **Asandigdha Dharana** (holding things unambiguously). 

The **Prayog Mati Sampada** has four types: **Swayan Ki Shakti Ke Anusar Vad-Vivad** (debating according to one's own strength), **Parishad Ko Dekhkar Vad-Vivad** (debating by looking at the assembly), **Kshetra Ko Dekhkar Vad-Vivad** (debating by looking at the field), and **Kal Ko Dekhkar Vad-Vivad** (debating by looking at the time). The **Sangrah Parijna Sampada** has five types: **Varshakal Mein Sabhi Muniyon Ke Niwas Ke Liye Yogyasthan Ki Pareeksha** (examining a suitable place for the residence of all the monks during the rainy season), **Sabhi Shramanon Ke Liye Pratiharik Peet, Falak, Shayya, Sanstark Ki Vyavastha** (arranging seats, platforms, beds, and bedding for all the monks), **Niyamit Samay Par Pratiyek Kary Karna** (doing every task at the appointed time), **Apne Se Jyest Shramanon Ka Satkar-Samman** (honoring and respecting the senior monks). 

After describing the **Gani Sampada**, the text discusses the four types of **Vinay-Pratipatti** related to them: **Achar Vinay**, **Shruta Vinay**, **Vikshepan Av Vinay**, and **Dosha Nirghat Vinay**. This fourfold **Vinay-Pratipatti** is called **Guru Sambandhi Vinay-Pratipatti**. Similarly, the **Shishya Sambandhi Vinay-Pratipatti** has four types: **Upakaranotpadanta** (producing tools), **Sahayata** (assistance), **Varna Sanjwalanta** (praising the qualities), and **Bhar Pratyavarohaanta** (reducing the burden). Each of these has four types again. Thus, the presented **Uddeshak** analyzes a total of 32 types of **Vinay-Pratipatti**. 

The fifth **Uddeshak** describes ten types of **Chitta Samadhi**: **Dharma Bhavana**, **Swapna Darshan**, **Jati Smaran Gyan**, **Dev Darshan**, **Avadhi Gyan**, **Avadhi Darshan**, **Manah Paryav Gyan**, **Keval Gyan**, **Keval Darshan**, and **Keval Maran** (Nirvana). Along with the description of these ten stages, it sheds light on the specific nature of **Mohaniya Karma**. 

The sixth **Uddeshak** describes eleven types of **Upasak Pratiman**. Before describing the **Pratiman**, it depicts the nature of **Mithyadrishti** and explains that it gives punishment without any consideration for justice or injustice. For example, it gives punishments like **Sampattiharan** (taking away property), **Mudan** (shaving), **Tarjan** (threatening), **Tadan** (beating), **Anduk Bandhan** (tying with a rope), **Nigad Bandhan** (tying with chains), **Kasth Bandhan** (tying with wood), **Charak Bandhan** (imprisonment), **Nigad Yugal Sankutan** (tying the limbs together), **Hast, Pad, Karn, Nasika, Ashth, Shirsha, Mukh, Ved Adi Ka Chhedan** (cutting the hands, feet, ears, nose, teeth, head, mouth, and Vedas), **Hriday Utpatana** (removing the heart), **Nayanadi Utpatana** (removing the eyes), **Ullamban** (hanging from a tree), **Gharshan** (rubbing), **Gholan** (mixing), **Shulaayan** (hanging on a spike), **Shulabhedan** (piercing with a spike), **Kshar Vartan** (sprinkling salt on wounds), **Darbha Vartan** (causing pain with grass), **Singh Puchhan** (lion's tail), **Vrushabha Puchhan** (bull's tail), **Dava Agni Dagdhan** (burning with fire), **Bhakta Panan Nirodh** (stopping food and water), etc., and experiences joy in doing so. But **Samyagdrishti** is **Praastik** and becomes an **Upasak** and practices the eleven **Pratiman**. These eleven **Upasak Pratiman** have already been described in **Upasak Dasang**.

Some preceptors believe that a lay follower who has completed the *pratima* (ritual) takes vows of *sannyasa* (renunciation). It is mentioned that Kartik Seth had performed the *pratima* 100 times. The seventh *uddeshika* (chapter) describes the *shraman* (ascetic) *pratimaa* (rituals). These *bhikshu* (monk) *pratimaa* are 12 in number. The first *pratima* requires the *bhikshu* to accept one *datti* (gift) of food and one *datti* of water. The *datti* is the continuous flow of food and water given by the donor to the *shraman*’s vessel. It is permissible to accept food from a place where it is prepared for one person, but not from a place where it is prepared for two, three, or more people. The duration of this *pratima* is one month. The second *pratima* is also for one month. In this, two *datti* of food and two *datti* of water are accepted. Similarly, in the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh *pratimaa*, three, four, five, six, and seven *datti* of food and the same number of *datti* of water are accepted respectively. Each *pratima* lasts for one month. They are called tri-monthly, four-monthly, etc., only because of the increase in the number of *datti*. The eighth *pratima* lasts for seven days and nights. It involves observing *chaubihar* (four-fold) fasting. One must stand facing the sky outside the village, lie on one side, and sit in *vishadhyasana* (with legs straight) and endure any *upsarga* (adverse conditions) with a calm mind. The ninth *pratima* also lasts for seven nights. In this, *chaubihar* is observed with *bela-bela* (at specific times) *parana* (breaking of fast). One must meditate in a secluded place outside the village in *dandasana*, *lagudasana*, or *utkatasana*. The tenth *pratima* also lasts for seven nights. In this, *chaubihar* is observed with *tele-tele* (at specific times) *parana*. One must meditate outside the village in *godohasana*, *virasana*, and *amrakubjasana*. The eleventh *pratima* lasts for one day and night. Its practice is done until the *path* (fourth) *prahar* (watch). *Chaubihar* is observed in this *pratima*. One must stand outside the city with both hands extended towards the knees like a staff and perform *kayotsarga* (relaxation of the body). The twelfth *pratima* lasts for only one night. Its practice is done with *tele* (at specific times). One must stand outside the village in the cremation ground, slightly bending the head, focusing on a single particle with steady eyes, and perform *kayotsarga* with unwavering determination. Any *upsarga* must be endured with equanimity. There are many rules for *shraman* who are in these *pratimaa*. For example, if a *pratima* observer is *nirgrantha* (without possessions), they should divide the begging time into three parts: beginning, middle, and end. They should not go begging in the middle and end parts after going in the beginning part. A *shraman* who is in a monthly *pratima* can stay for one night where they are known. If they are unknown, they can stay for two nights. Staying for longer than that incurs a penalty of *ched* (punishment) or *tap* (penance) for the same number of days. Similarly, other strict rules can be imposed. For example, if a fire breaks out in the *upaashraya* (shelter), they should not go inside. If someone tries to pull them out, they should not resist but carefully exit. Similarly, if a mad elephant, horse, bull, dog, tiger, etc., comes in front of them, they should not retreat even a step out of fear. They should patiently endure cold and heat. The eighth *uddeshika* (chapter) describes the *paryushana* (penance) *kalpa* (ritual). The word *paryushana* is derived from the prefix *pari* and the root *vas* [46]...

---------------------------
"Anaḥ" is a suffix used to form this word. It means self-immersion, self-delight, or being in one's own self.  /  The second meaning of Paryushana Kalpa is to reside in one place. It is of two types: Salamban and Nirāvalamban. Salamban means with a cause, and Nirāvalamban means without a cause.  /  Nirāvalamban has two divisions: Jghanya (inferior) and Utkrushta (superior). The synonyms of Paryushana are as follows: (1) Pariyāya Vatthavaṇā, (2) Pajjosamaṇā, (3) Pāgaiyā, (4) Parivasaṇā, (5) Pajjusaṇā, (6) Vāsāvāsa, (7) Padhamasamosaraṇa, (8) Thavaṇā, and (9) Jetthoggha. All these names have the same meaning, but there is a slight difference in meaning based on the difference in etymology. This difference in meaning demonstrates the importance of various traditions related to Paryushana and the actions performed during that specific time.  /  These meanings also reveal some historical facts.  /  The seniority and juniority of Dikshaparaya are calculated based on the Paryushana period. Paryushana period is considered a type of year count. Therefore, Paryushana is considered the cause of the state of Dikshaparaya.  /  During Varshavas, certain specific actions related to substances, fields, time, and emotions are performed. Therefore, Paryushana is also called Pajjosamaṇā. Third, it is called "Pāgaiyā" (natural) because it is to be worshipped equally by householders and others. During this fixed period, the seeker tries to stay closer to the soul, hence it is also called Parivasaṇā. Paryushana also means service. During this period, the seeker serves and worships the qualities of the soul like knowledge and vision, hence it is called Pajjusaṇā. In this Kalpa, the Shraman resides in one place for four months, hence it is called Vāsāvāsa Varshavas. If there is no specific reason, entry into the area suitable for Chaturmas is done only during the rainy season, hence it is called Prathamasamavasaraṇa.  /  Its boundaries vary depending on the seasonal period. Therefore, it is called Thavaṇā (establishment).  /  There is a field acquisition for each month during the seasonal period, but for four months during the rainy season, hence it is called Jetthoggha (Jyeshthaavagraha). If the Sadhu has reached the designated place by Ashadhi Purnima and declared Varshavas, then Varshavas begins from Shravan Krishna Panchami. If the suitable area is not found, then Varshavas should be started on Shravan Krishna Dashami. If the suitable area is still not found, then Varshavas should be started on Shravan Krishna Panchadashi-Amavasya.  /  Even if the suitable area is not found, it is considered mandatory to start Varshavas by Bhadrapad Shukla Panchami, increasing the days by five each time. If the suitable area is not found even by this time, then Paryushana Kalpa should be performed under a tree.  /  But this date should not be violated under any circumstances. The current Paryushana Kalpasutra is the eighth study of the Dasha Shruta Skandha. The oldest copies of Dasha Shruta Skandha, which are from before the fourteenth century, have the complete Kalpasutra in the eighth study. This clearly proves that Kalpasutra is not an independent work but the eighth study of Dasha Shruta Skandha.  /  [47]

Secondly, the appointment of the second Bhadrabahu, which is mentioned in the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha and dates back to the sixth century BCE, provides an explanation for the terms used in the text. Muni Shri Punyavijayaji believes that the commentary on the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha is approximately sixteen hundred years old. The first sutra of the Kalpa Sutra states, "Teṇam kāleṇam teṇam samaeṇam samaṇo bhagavā mahāvīre.............." and the last sutra states, "..............bhujjo bhujjo uvadamsei." The same text is found in the eighth uddeśaka [chapter] of the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha. Here, the remaining text is abbreviated under the word "jav." The text currently available only describes the Panch Kalyanak, which has no connection to the Paryushana Kalpa. Therefore, it is clear that the Paryushana Kalpa was the complete Kalpa Sutra in this study. The authors of both the Kalpa Sutra and the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha are Bhadrabahu. Therefore, since both are works of the same author, it can be said that the Kalpa Sutra is a textual study of the Dasha-Shruta-Skandha. This is clearly evidenced by the commentary, churni, Prithvichandatippan, and other commentaries on the Kalpa Sutra. The ninth uddeśaka describes 30 maha-mohaniya (greatly deluding) places. The pudgala karmas (karmic particles) that bind the soul are called karmas. Mohaniya karma (deluding karma) is the most prominent among them. There is no limit to the causes of mohaniya karma bandha (binding of deluding karma), but the scriptural authors have mentioned thirty types of causes that lead to mohaniya karma bandha. Among them, the intensity and cruelty of durdhyavasa (stubbornness) are so great that sometimes maha-mohaniya karma is bound, causing the soul to wander in the world for 70 koṭi-koṭi sāgaropam (billions of billions of oceans). Acharya Haribhadra and Jinadasagani use only the word mohaniya. The Uttaradhyayanasutra, Samavayangasutra, and Dasha-Shruta-Skandha also refer to mohaniya sthana (deluding places). However, the word "mahamoham pakuvvai" (greatly deluding) is used in the description of the types. These places include drowning living beings in water, killing them by suffocating them, killing them by tying wet leather on their heads, engaging in illicit sex in secret, falsely accusing someone, claiming to be a celibate even though one is not, criticizing a Kevalajnani (omniscient), claiming to be a scholar even though one is not, practicing magic, repeatedly using sexually suggestive language, etc. The tenth uddeśaka is called "Ayati Sthana" (Place of Effort). It describes various nidanas (causes). Nidana means the resolution that arises from the desire for fulfillment due to the influence of delusion, which leads to the desire for objects like lust, etc. When desires arise in the human mind due to the strong influence of delusion, he makes a firm resolution to fulfill them. This particular resolution is nidana. Due to nidana, human desires continue to exist even in the future, preventing him from being liberated from the cycle of birth and death. From the perspective of future birth and death, this uddeśaka is called Prayati Sthana (Place of Effort). Prayati means birth or caste. It is considered Ayati Sthana because it is the cause of nidana. In other words, if "ti" is separated from Ayati, "pay" remains. Pray means benefit. The nidana that benefits birth and death is called Ayati. This chapter describes how Bhagavan Mahavira arrived in Rajagaha. King Shrenik and Queen Chelna arrived to pay their respects to the Bhagavan. Seeing the divine and magnificent form and great prosperity of King Shrenik, the Shramanas began to think, "Shrenik appears to be like a god himself. If we also have the fruits of our austerities, rules, and restraint, then we too can 1. Tisan moha-thanai-abhikkhanam-abhikkhanam ayaremane va samaayaremane va mohanijjatae kammam pakarei.

---------------------------
They wished to become like Chelna. Seeing the beautiful, radiant form and splendor of Queen Chelna, a resolve arose in the minds of the Shramanis that if their practice bore fruit, they would become like Chelna in their next birth. The Antaryami Mahavira knew their resolve and asked the Shramanas and Shramanis if such a resolve had arisen in their minds. They replied in the affirmative, "Yes, Bhagavan! This is true." The Lord said, "The Nirgrantha-Pravachana is the best, it is complete, it destroys all karmas. Those Shramanas or Shramanis who, turning away from Dharma, are attracted by wealth and splendor, and make a Nidana, if they complete their lifespan without atonement, are born in the Devaloka, and from there they are reborn in the Manavloka. Due to the Nidana, they do not attain Kevali Dharma. They remain forever captivated by worldly objects." The Shastrakar has described 9 types of Nidan and explained that the Nirgrantha Pravachana is the only means of liberation from all karmas. Therefore, one should not make a Nidana, and if one has made it, one should become free by performing Alochana-Prayaschitta. In conclusion, the biography of Bhagavan Mahavira is found in detail in the Pathvi Dasha of this Pragama. There is a beautiful description of Chittasamadhi and Dharmacinta. There is also a description of the different types of Upasaka-Pratima and Bhikshu-Pratima. The Brihatkalpa has a glorious place in the Cheda Sutras. Like other Cheda Sutras, this Sutra also contemplates on the rules of conduct for Shramanas, including Vidhi-Nishedha, Utsarga-Apabad, Tapas, Prayaschitta, etc. It has six Uddesakas, 81 Adhikars, and 473 Shlokas in the available original text. There are 206 Sutra numbers. The first Uddesaka has 50 Sutras. The first five Sutras are about Tal-Prlamb. It is forbidden for Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis to take Tal and Prlamb. It is stated that one should not take unripe Tal fruit or Tal root, but one should take ripe Tal Prlamb. The rules regarding Masakalpa state that Shramanas should stay in one place for a maximum period of 8 months during the Hemant and Grishma seasons. It is not permissible for Shramanas to stay in the following 16 types of places for more than one month at a time, except during the rainy season, with or without a Prachira or Prachira. 1. Gram [where 18 types of taxes are levied by the state] 2. Magar [where 18 types of taxes are not levied] 3. Khet [which has an earthen wall around it] 4. Karbat [where few people live] 5. Madamb [where there is no village for two and a half kos] [49]

Page #51:
---------------------------
6. Pattana [where all things are available] 7. Aakar [where all things are available] 8. Dronamukha [where there is a path connecting water and land, where sea goods are unloaded] 9. Nigam [where merchants reside] 10. Rajdhani [where the king's palace etc. are] 11. Prashram [where ascetics etc. live] 12. Nivesh Sannivesh [where merchants unload their goods] 13. Sambadh-Sambah [where farmers live or where people from other villages come to stay in mountains, caves etc. for the protection of their wealth etc. from their village] 14. Ghosh [where Gujar people-Gwalas who graze cows etc. live] 15. Anshika [half, third or fourth part of a village] 16. Putbhadan [where merchants of the village come to sell their goods]. They can stay inside and outside the city walls for one month each. While staying inside, they should take alms from inside and while staying outside, they should take alms from outside. Shramanis can stay inside for two months and outside for two months. Where there is only one gate of the city wall, Nirgranth and Nirgranthis are prohibited from staying together, but if there are many gates, they can stay. Where there are many shops around the Upashraya, many gates, Sadhvis should not stay there, but Sadhu can stay with effort. / Where the place is completely open, there are no gates, Sadhvis should not stay there. If there is no Upashraya-place by way of exception, they can stay by putting up a curtain. Nirgranths are also allowed to stay in an open place. Nirgranth and Nirgranthis have been allowed to keep and use a cloth mosquito net [Chilimilika]. Nirgranth and Nirgranthis are not allowed to stand, sit, lie down, sleep, eat, drink, study etc. near a water body. / Where there are pictures that cause lust, Shraman-Shramanis should not stay there. They should not stay without the permission of the house owner. Shraman-Shramanis should not stay in a house where there is a path in the middle - where householders live. / If there is a quarrel between an Acharya, Upadhyaya, Shraman or Shramani of a Shraman, they should apologize to each other. He who is calm is a worshiper. The essence of Shram Dharma is Upsham - "Uvasamsaram Samannam". Vihar is prohibited during Varshavas, but it is prescribed during Hemant and Grishma seasons. Nirgranth-Nirgranthis are prohibited from wandering repeatedly in unfavorable areas. Because there is a possibility of violation of restraint. Therefore, there is a provision for atonement. [ 50 ]

---------------------------
If a householder wishes to give clothes, vessels, blankets, etc. to a monk who has gone out for alms or for bodily needs, then the monk should take and keep them only after obtaining permission from the Acharya. Similarly, the permission of the Pravartini is necessary for the Dharmni. Monks and nuns are prohibited from taking food, etc. at night or at an inappropriate time. Similarly, it is prohibited to take clothes, vessels, blankets, and cleaning materials. As an exception, if a thief has stolen the clothes of monks and nuns and they have been recovered, they can be taken at night. If the clothes have been worn by thieves, cleaned, dyed, or perfumed with fragrant substances, they can also be taken. Nirgranth and Nirgranthis are prohibited from traveling at night or at an inappropriate time. If it is necessary to go for Uccarabhumi, etc., as an exception, they should not go alone but should take Sadhus with them. The boundaries of the traveling area for Nirgranth and Nirgranthis have been considered. In the past, the Aryakshetra extended from Angadesh and Magadhadesh in the east to Kausambi in the south, to Sthuna in the west, and to Kunala in the north. Traveling in the Aryakshetra increases knowledge and vision. If there is no possibility of loss of the Ratna-tray by going to the Anaryakshetra, then one can go. In the second Uddeshak, 12 sutras on Upashraya state that monks and nuns should not stay even for a short time in an Upashraya where rice, barley, mung, urad, etc. are scattered. However, if they are piled up in one place, it is permissible to stay there during the winter and summer seasons. If they are stored safely in a storehouse, etc., it is permissible to stay there even during the rainy season. Sadhus and Sadhvis should not stay even for a short time in a place where Suravikat, Sauviravikat, etc. are kept. If, due to circumstances, no other place is available even after searching, the monk can stay for two nights, but not more. Staying for longer than that incurs the atonement of Chhed or Parihar. Similarly, one should not stay in an Upashraya that has a cold water well, a hot water well, a lamp, a lamp, etc. Similarly, one should not take food, etc. from the owner of one or more houses. If there is one main owner, one can take from the rest. Here, the Shayatar is the main one whose permission has been taken. The various aspects of Shayatar have been considered. Nirgranth-Nirgranthis can take clothes in five ways: Jangik, Bhangik, Sanak, Potak, and Tiritpattak.

Page #53:
---------------------------
It is permissible to have five types of "rajoharan": auṇik, prauṣṭrik, sānak, vaccakcipphak, and mūjccipphak. In the third uddeśaka, it is not permissible for nirgranthas to sit, sleep, eat, drink, study, meditate, or perform kayotsarga in the shelter of nirgranthis. Similarly, it is not permissible for nirgranthis to sit, eat, drink, etc. in the shelter of nirgranthas. The next four sūtras discuss the rules regarding clothing, consumption, etc. Regarding clothing, it is stated that they should not be colored, but should be white. The rules regarding what items to wear or not wear are laid out. The rules regarding clothing at the time of initiation are also described. It is forbidden to take clothes during the rainy season, but there is no obstacle to taking clothes during the winter and summer seasons if necessary. The division of clothing is also considered in this regard. It is not permissible for nirgranthas and nirgranthis to take pratihārik items and travel elsewhere without giving them to their owner. If someone steals an item, it should be investigated and returned to the owner if found. If necessary, it can be used with the owner's permission. In the fourth uddeśaka, the rules for atonement are laid out for offenses related to abrahmasevan, night-time meals, etc. A pandaka, napuṣaka, and vātika are ineligible for pravrajyā. Even having sexual intercourse with them, eating together, etc. is forbidden. It is inappropriate to teach scriptures to an avinīta, rasalolopi, or krodhi. The three types of people who are ineligible for pravrajyā and teaching are duṣṭa, mūḍha, and duvidagdha. If a nirgranthi is ill or for any other reason needs the support of their father, brother, son, etc. to get up or sit down, and desires the support of a sādhaka, they receive a cāturmāsika prāyaścitta. Similarly, if a nirgranthi mother, wife, etc. needs support and desires the support of a sādhvi, they also receive a cāturmāsika prāyaścitta. This is because there is a possibility of violating the fourth vrata, so atonement is prescribed. It is not permissible for nirgranthas and nirgranthis to accept kalātikrānta, kṣetrātikrānta, praśnādi, etc. It is not permissible to keep food brought by the first pauruṣī until the fourth pauruṣī. If it is forgotten, it should be given to a partha. There is a rule for atonement if it is used. If, by mistake, an aneṣaṇīya, snigdha praśnādi, etc. has come in the alms, it should be given to a śramaṇa who has not established the mahāvrata. If there is no such śramaṇa, it should be given to a partha in a blameless place. Food, etc. prepared for śramaṇas who are in the state of āchelakya, etc. is permissible for śramaṇas who are not in that state. Food, etc. prepared for śramaṇas who are not in that state is not permissible for śramaṇas who are in that state. Here, "kalpasthita" means "pancayāmadharmapratipanna" and "akalpasthita" means "cāturyāmadharmapratipanna". 1. "auṇik" means "ūranikānāmūrṇābhinivṛttam", "prauṣṭrik" means "uṣṭromābhinivṛttam", "sānak" means "sanavṛkṣavalkādjātam", "vācakah" means "tṛṇaviśeṣastasyacippakah", "kuṭṭitaḥ tvagūpaḥ ten niṣpanna vaccakcipphakam", "mujah" means "śarastambastasyacippakādjātam mūjccipphakam nāma pañcamam iti". - U. 2, Sū. 25 [52]

---------------------------
If a Nigrantha wishes to be ordained in another gana due to knowledge or other reasons, the permission of the Acharya is required. Similarly, if a Pracharaya, Upadhyaya, Ganavachchedak, etc., wishes to be ordained in another gana, they should join the other gana only after making suitable arrangements in their own community. If a Shraman or Shramani attains Kaladharma during the evening or night, other Shraman-Shramanis should keep the dead body carefully throughout the night. In the morning, they should bring bamboo, etc., from a householder's house, tie the deceased with it, and place it on a harmless land in the forest. They should then return the bamboo, etc., to the householder. If a Shraman has quarreled with a householder, he should not engage in begging until the householder is pacified. To explain the method of accepting Pariharavishuddhacharitra, on the day of Parana, the Acharya and Upadhyaya themselves go to the Shraman, provide him with food, and after returning to their own place, explain the method of observing Pariharavishuddhacharitra. Shraman-Shramanis should not cross more than one of the five great rivers, Ganga, Yamuna, Sarayu, Koshika, and Mahi, in a month. Shallow rivers like Airavati, etc., can be crossed two or three times a month. Shraman-Shramanis should stay in harmless huts made of grass, where they cannot stand properly, during the Hemant and Grishma seasons. If the hut is made of harmless grass, etc., and is less than two hands high, they cannot stay there during the rainy season. If it is more than two hands high, they can stay there during the rainy season. The Pancham Uddeshak states that if a deva takes the form of a woman and holds the hand of a Sadhu, and the Sadhu considers her soft touch pleasurable, he incurs the sin of Mithuna Pratisevan and has to perform Chaturmasik Guru-Prayaschitta. Similarly, if a Sadhvi experiences the touch of a man and considers it pleasurable, she also incurs Chaturmasik Guru-Prayaschitta. If a Shraman joins another gana without resolving a conflict and the Acharya of that gana learns that he has come there after quarreling, he should be given a five-night punishment and then pacified and sent back to his own gana. If a strong or weak Shraman takes food, etc., thinking that the sun has risen or has not yet set, and then learns that the sun has not yet risen or has already set, he should immediately abandon the food, etc. He does not incur the sin of night food. One who takes food, etc., with doubt about sunrise and sunset incurs the sin of night food. Shraman-Shramanis should spit out any food, etc., that comes into their mouth through belching, etc., at night. If a Dwindriya, etc., creature falls into food, etc., it should be carefully removed and the food, etc., should be consumed. If it cannot be removed, it should be placed in a secluded, harmless place. If drops of water fall into food, etc., while eating, and the food is hot, there is no fault in eating it. [53]

Page #55:
---------------------------
Because the drops that fall in it become unmindful / If the food is cold, one should neither eat it oneself nor feed it to others, but should place it in a secluded place. For a Nirgranthi, to live alone, to remain naked, to be without possessions, to take sunbath outside the village, to sit in Utkatukasana, Virasana, Dandasana, Lagudshayi and other asanas and perform Kayotsarga is the way. - It is inconceivable for Nirgranthis to take the Mok (urine or spit) of each other, but it can be taken due to reasons like illness / If a Bhikshu in the form of a Parihar has to go elsewhere on the orders of a Sthavir, etc., he should go quickly and return after completing the work. If there is any kind of fault in the character, then one should purify oneself by performing atonement. In the sixth Uddeshak, it is stated that Nirgranthis should not speak six types of words: Alik (false) words, Heelitavachan, Khisitavachan, Parushavachan, Garhasthikavachan, Vyavashmitodiranavachan (words that stir up a settled dispute). One who accuses someone of Pranatipat, Mrishvad, Adattadan, Avirati-Abrahma, Napusak, Das, etc., receives atonement. If a thorn has pierced the foot of a Nirgranthi and he is unable to remove it, then a Nirgranthi can remove it as an exception. Similarly, if there is a situation of drowning, falling, slipping, etc. in a river, etc., then a Sadhu or Sadhvi can save him by holding his hand / Similarly, a Nirgranthi with a disturbed mind can be taken to his place by holding his hand, in the same way, a Sadhvi can also take him by holding his hand. It should be remembered that these are exceptional sutras. There is no feeling of depravity in this, but a feeling of protecting each other's restraint. The name of the Sadhu's code of conduct is Kalpasthiti / It is of six types - Samayik-Sanyatakalpasthiti, Chhedopasthapaniya Sanyatakalpasthiti, Nirvishamanakalpasthiti, Nivishtakayikakalpasthiti, Jinkalpasthiti and Sthavirakalpasthiti. _In this way, Brihatkalpa sheds light on many important facts related to the life and conduct of Shraman-Shramani. This is the special feature of this scripture. Vyavaharsutra Brihatkalpa and Vyavahar are both complementary to each other / Vyavahar is also a Chhedasutra which is Charananuyogamaya. It has ten Uddeshak / 373 Anushtup shlokas are the available original text / 267 are the number of sutras. In the first Uddeshak, a Shraman who consumes a fault worthy of monthly atonement and criticizes that fault to the Acharya, etc. without deceit, receives a monthly atonement, while if he does it with deceit, he becomes a participant in a bi-monthly atonement. A Sadhak who criticizes a fault worthy of bi-monthly atonement without deceit receives a bi-monthly atonement, and if he does it with deceit, he receives a three-month atonement / In this way, three, four, five and six months [ 54 ]

Page #56:
---------------------------
There is a provision for atonement. The provision for atonement is for a maximum of six months. One who has committed many offenses should be criticized in order and then atonement should be taken for all together. Even while doing atonement, if the offense is committed again, then atonement should be done again. The Shraman who is taking atonement should get up and sit with other Sadhus only after taking permission from the Sthavir etc. If he sits with someone in violation of the permission, then his Dikshaparaya for that many days is reduced, which is called a hole in the Agamic language. He can go to another place for the service of Sthavir etc. by abandoning the Pariharakalp / A Shraman wanders alone by abandoning the Gan, and if he feels unable to follow the pure conduct, then he should be criticized and a hole or new Diksha should be taken / The same rule applies to the single-minded Ganavchhedak, Acharya and Shithilachari Shraman as is generally for the single-minded Shraman. Criticism should be done in front of the Pracharya, Upadhyay and atonement should be taken to become pure. If they are absent, then criticism should be done in front of their Sambhogi, Sarmic, Bahushrut etc. If they are not nearby, then criticism should be done by going to the Sambhogi, Bahushrut etc. Shraman of another community wherever they are and atonement should be taken. If they are also not there, then if there is a Sarupik (Sadoshi) but Bahushrut Sadhu, then atonement should be taken by going there. If he is also not there, then atonement should be taken by going to the Bahushrut Shramanopasak, and if he is also absent, then atonement should be taken by going to the Samyagdristi Gahesth / In the absence of all these, go outside the village or city and stand facing the east or north direction, fold both hands and criticize your offense / It is said in the second Uddeshak that if two Sarmic are together with the same Samachari and one of them has committed an offense, then atonement should be taken in front of the other. The burden of service etc. of the one doing atonement remains on the other Shraman. If both have committed the offense, then they should criticize each other, take atonement and serve. If one Shraman has committed an offense out of many Shramans, then atonement should be given to only one / If all have committed an offense, then all except one should take atonement and purify themselves, and after their atonement is complete, he should also be given atonement and purified. It is not considered appropriate to remove the Pariharakalp-situated Shraman from the Gachch if he becomes ill / It is the duty of the Ganavchhedak to make him recite the Bayavritti until he becomes healthy, and after becoming healthy, he should take atonement because he served in the Sadoshavस्था. Similarly, the one who is doing Anvasthapy and Paranchik atonement should not be removed from the Gachch in the state of illness. The Viksiptchitt should also not be removed from the Gachch, and until his mind becomes stable, his full service should be done, and after becoming healthy, nominal atonement should be given. Similarly, the Deeptchitt (whose mind has become inflamed with pride), Unmadprapt, Upsargprapt, Sadhikarana, Saprayaschitt etc. should not be removed from the Gachch. The ninth Anvasthapy atonement-taking Sadhu should be reinstated in restraint without making him wear a Mrihsthalang [ 55 ]

---------------------------
It should not be done, because its offense is so great that without doing so, its full atonement cannot be done, and nor is fear generated in the minds of other Shramans towards that type of offense. Similarly, after dressing the Shraman with the tenth Paranchik atonement in the garb of a householder, he should be re-established in restraint / This right is in the hands of the atonement giver that he can also dress him in another type of garb without dressing him in the garb of a householder. It is not appropriate for Pariharic and Apariharic Shramans to eat together / Apariharic Shramans should not eat with Pariharic Shramans without completing their tapas, because those who are ascetics, after completing their tapas, cannot eat with them before one month of tapas has passed for five days and six months of tapas for one month, because during those days they need a special type of food which is not necessary for others / The third Uddeshak states that if a Shraman has a desire in his mind to wander independently, but he is not knowledgeable about Acharang etc., then even if he has disciples etc. with his family, it is not appropriate to be independent by forming a separate gana. If he is knowledgeable about Acharang etc., then he should wander after taking permission from the sthavir, the one who wanders without the permission of the sthavir has to be a part of the chhed or Pariharic atonement for as many days as he has wandered in this way. Only one who has been initiated for at least three years, is proficient in the practice of Nirgranth, is proficient in restraint, is proficient in Acharang Pradi Pravachanshastras, is fully capable of giving atonement, is skilled in deciding the field etc. for the Sangha, is virtuous, is learned etc. can become an Upadhyay. One who is skilled in the practice of Shraman, is adept in preaching, is knowledgeable about Dashashrutaskandha-Kalpa-Brihatkalpavyavahar and has been initiated for at least five years can become an Acharya / Acharya, Upadhyay, Pravartini, Sthavir, Gani, Ganavchhedak can be given to one who is skilled in the practice of Shraman, is proficient in preaching, is unattached in mind and is knowledgeable about Stananga-Samavayanga. In an exception, a sadhu who has been initiated for one day can also be established in the position of Acharya, Upadhyay. Such a sadhu must be a believer, patient, trustworthy, impartial, joyful, permitted, majority and of high birth and endowed with qualities. One should follow restraint only with the permission of the Acharya or Upadhyay / One who consumes non-Brahma is ineligible for the position of Acharya etc. / If he has done such a deed after abandoning the Gachchha, then after taking re-initiation and three years have passed, if his mind is stable, his vices are calm, there is no lack of kshaya etc., then he can be established in the position of Acharya. The fourth Uddeshak states that there should be at least one other sadhu with the Acharya or Upadhyay in the Hemant and Grishma seasons and two with the Ganavchhedak / In the rainy season, it is necessary to have two sadhus with the Acharya and Upadhyay and three with the Ganavchhedak. [ 56 ]

---------------------------
This text sheds light on the importance of the Acharya and explains how to conduct oneself in their absence. If the Acharya or Upadhyaya is seriously ill and their life expectancy is low, all other Shramans should be called together and the Acharya should declare that upon their passing, a particular Sadhu should be given a particular position. If, after their death, that Sadhu does not seem suitable, another can be appointed. If the Sadhu is deemed suitable, they should be appointed. If another suitable Shraman is not yet proficient in the Acharanga and other texts, they can be temporarily appointed to any position with the consent of the Acharya and others. Once a suitable candidate is found, the previous individual should relinquish their position. Failure to do so will result in a penance. If two Shramans are traveling together, they should conduct themselves as senior and junior according to their qualifications and respect each other. The same applies to the Acharya and Upadhyaya. In the fifth Uddeshak, the Pravartini should travel from village to village in the cold and hot seasons with at least two other Sadhvis, and the Ganavachhedaka should be accompanied by three other Sadhvis. During the rainy season, the Pravartini should be accompanied by three and the Ganavachhedaka by four Sadhvis. The same rules regarding the death of the Pravartini and the appointment of a successor apply to the Shramanis as they do to the Shramans. The general rule for Vaiavrittya is that a Shraman should not perform Vaiavrittya for a Shramani, and vice versa. However, they can serve each other in exceptional circumstances. In cases of snakebite or other emergencies, service can be provided by a householder, but this is not permitted for Sthavirakalpis. Vaiavrittya is not permitted for Jinakalpis. If they seek service, they must perform a Pariharic penance. The sixth Uddeshak states that one should not visit their relatives without the permission of the Sthaviras. Shramans and Shramanis who are Alpashrut and Alp-Pragami should not visit their relatives alone. If they must visit, they should do so with a Bahushrut and Bahupragamdhari Shraman or Shramani. Food that is cooked and ready before the arrival of a Shraman is acceptable, but food that is not ready is not acceptable. When the Acharya or Upadhyaya arrives at the Upashraya from outside, their feet should be wiped clean. Their belongings, such as their Lghunit, should be carefully placed on the ground. They should be served with Vaiavrittya as much as possible. They should be accompanied within the Upashraya. When they leave the Upashraya, they should be accompanied. The Ganavachhedak should be accompanied within the Upashraya and when leaving. Shramans and Shramanis are expected to live with Shramans and Shramanis who are knowledgeable in the Pracharanga and other Agamas. Living with those who are not knowledgeable will result in penance. If Shramans and Shramanis from other Gachchas come for a specific reason, and they are innocent, virtuous, free from major faults, untouched by anger and other negative emotions, and self-critical, they should be treated with equality. Otherwise, they should not be. [ 57 ]

---------------------------
The seventh Uddeshak states that a Sadhu should not initiate a woman and a Sadhvi should not initiate a man. If a woman in a place where there is no Sadhvi nearby feels a desire for renunciation, then she can be initiated on the condition that she will be entrusted to a Sadhvi as soon as possible. Similarly, a Sadhvi can also initiate a man. It is not considered appropriate for Shramanis to wander in places where thieves, rogues, or wicked people are prevalent, as there is a fear of theft of clothes and other belongings, and violation of vows. There is no such restriction for Shramans. If a Shraman has a feud with another Shraman who resides in a dangerous place (a place inhabited by thieves, etc.), then he should go there and apologize to him, but not while staying in his own place. However, a Shramani can apologize from her own place. It is not considered appropriate for Sadhus and Sadhvis to wander freely without the control of the Acharya and Upadhyaya. The eighth Uddeshak highlights that a Sadhu should bring bedding materials that can be lifted with one hand, and should be brought from a distance that can be covered in three days. For a bound Nirgranth, it is considered appropriate to bring such materials from a distance that can be covered in five days, if necessary. The following equipment is considered appropriate for a Sthavir: Danda, Bhand, Chatra, Matrika, Lasthik (pillow or cushion to be kept behind the back), a cushion for meditation, Chel (cloth), Chel-Chilimilika (cloth curtain), Charm, Charmkosh (leather bag), Charm-Palich (piece of leather for wrapping). Those equipment that cannot be carried along can be kept at the residence of a householder near the Upashraya and used from time to time. If there are many Shramans in a place, and one of them has forgotten some equipment at a householder's place, and another Shraman goes there, then the householder should tell the Shraman that this equipment belongs to a saint of your community. Then the saint should take the equipment and come to his own place and give it to the one who owns it. If the equipment does not belong to any saint, then he should neither use it himself nor give it to others for use, but should abandon it in a harmless place. If the Shraman has left from there, then he should search for him and deliver it to him personally. If his exact address is not known, then he should deposit it in a secluded place. While discussing Pahar, it has been stated that one who eats eight morsels is called Alp-Yahari, one who eats twelve morsels is called Aparthavmaudrik, one who eats sixteen morsels is called Dvibhagaprapt, one who eats twenty-four morsels is called PraptAvmaudrik, one who eats thirty-two morsels is called PramanopetAhari, and one who eats one morsel less than thirty-two is called Avmaudrik. The ninth Uddeshak states that if a Shramatar has ownership or some right over food, etc., then that food is not acceptable for Shramans and Shramanis. It also mentions the Bhikshu-Pratimans, which we have already discussed in the description of DashaShrutaSkandha. The tenth Uddeshak, while describing the form of Yavamdhyachandra-Pratima or Vanamdhyachandra-Pratima, states that one which is thick in the middle and thin on both sides, like a grain of barley, is called Yavamdhyachandra-Pratima. One which is thin in the middle and thick on both sides, like a forest, is called Vajramdhyachandra-Pratima. The holder of Yavamdhyachandra-Pratima is called Vamdhyachandra-Pratima. One who is like a forest [ 58 ]

---------------------------
A Shraman, for a period of one month, renounces attachment to his body and bears all favorable and unfavorable circumstances related to Devas, humans, and animals with equanimity. On the first day of the bright fortnight, he takes one datti of food and one datti of water. On the second day, he takes two datti of food and two datti of water. In this way, he increases by one datti each day, taking 15 datti of food and 15 datti of water on the full moon day. In the dark fortnight, he decreases by one datti each day and observes a fast on the new moon day. This is called Yavamध्यचन्द्रप्रतिमा. In Vajramध्यचन्द्रप्रतिमा, 15 datti of food and 15 datti of water are taken on the first day of the dark fortnight. This is decreased daily until one datti of food and one datti of water are taken on the new moon day. In the bright fortnight, one datti is increased each day until a fast is observed on the full moon day. Thus, in each 30-day pratima, food is taken according to datti for 29 days and a fast is observed on the last day. There are five types of व्यवहार: आगम, श्रुत, आज्ञा, धारणा, and जीतव्यवहार. आगम is the first and the others are discussed in detail in the commentary. There are three types of स्थविर: जातिस्थविर, सूत्रस्थविर, and प्रव्रज्यास्थविर. A Shraman who is 60 years old is called जातिस्थविर or वयःस्थविर. One who knows ठाणांग and समवायांग is called सूत्रस्थविर, and one who has been initiated for 20 years and is निर्ग्रन्थ is called प्रव्रज्यास्थविर. There are three types of शैक्ष भूमियां: सप्त-रात्रिदिनी, चातुर्मासिकी, and षण्मासिकी. It is not permissible to initiate children below the age of eight years. Those who are young are not eligible to study प्राचारांगसूत्र. It is permissible to teach आचारांग to a sadhu who has been initiated for at least three years. It is permissible to teach सूत्रकृतांग to one who has been initiated for four years, दशाश्रुतस्कन्ध, कल्प (बृहत्कल्प), and व्यवहार to one who has been initiated for five years, स्थानांग and समवायांग to one who has been initiated for eight years, व्याख्याप्रज्ञप्ति (भगवती) to one who has been initiated for ten years, लघुविमान-प्रविभक्ति, महाविमानप्रविभक्ति, अंगचूलिका, बंगलिका, and विवाह-चूलिका to one who has been initiated for eleven years, अणोरुपपातिक, गरुलोपपातिक, धरणोपपातिक, वैश्रमणोपपातिक, and वैलंधरोपपातिक to one who has been initiated for twelve years, उपस्थानश्रुत, देवेन्द्रोपपात, and नागपरियापनिका (नागपरियावणिग्रा) to one who has been initiated for thirteen years, स्वप्नभावना to one who has been initiated for fourteen years, चारणभावना to one who has been initiated for fifteen years, वेदनीशतक to one who has been initiated for sixteen years, पाशीविषभावना to one who has been initiated for seventeen years, दृष्टिविधभावना to one who has been initiated for eighteen years, दृष्टिवाद to one who has been initiated for nineteen years, and all types of scriptures to one who has been initiated for twenty years. There are ten types of वैयावृत्य (service): 1. आचार्य की वैयावृत्य, 2. उपाध्याय की वैयावृत्य, 3. स्थविर की, 4. तपस्वी की, 5. शैक्ष-छात्र की, 6. ग्लान-रुग्ण की, 7. सामिक की, 8. कल की, 9. गण की, and 10. संघ की वैयावृत्य. These ten types of वैयावृत्य lead to महानिर्जरा. In conclusion, this sutra has many special features. It emphasizes स्वाध्याय. [59]

Furthermore, studying during an inappropriate time is prohibited. The concept of an inappropriate time for study has been discussed. The limits of study among monks and nuns have been defined. There is a description of the types of food intake: Kavalahari, Alpahari, and Unodari. Rules for the conduct of the Acharya and Upadhyaya in the Bihar have been laid down. There is a detailed discussion of the methods of criticism and atonement. The rules and regulations regarding the residence, study, conduct, and organization of the nuns have been discussed. The author of this text is believed to be Shrutakevali Bhadrabahu. 

To understand the profound secrets of the Agam literature, various commentaries have been created. This vast body of Agam commentary can be divided into five parts: (1) Niyuktis (Nijjutti), (2) Bhashyas (Bhas), (3) Chuniyas (Chunni), (4) Sanskrit commentaries, and (5) commentaries written in vernacular languages. 

The first commentaries written in Prakrit language, known as Niyuktis, are renowned. In Niyuktis, instead of commenting on every verse of the original text, the focus is primarily on explaining technical terms. Its style is that of the Niksepa method, which has been highly favored in jurisprudence. In the Niksepa method, after presenting multiple possible meanings of a single verse, the inappropriate meanings are rejected, and the appropriate meaning is accepted. The renowned German scholar, Sharpeentier, defined Niyukti as follows: "Niyuktis serve only as an index to their main part. They briefly mention all the detailed events." Bhadrabahu is considered the author of Niyuktis. We have written extensively about who he was in other introductions. Ten Niyuktis of Bhadrabahu are available. Among them is the Dasashrutaskandhaniyukti. 

The Dasashrutaskandhaniyukti begins with salutations to the first Shrutakevali Bhadrabahu, followed by a description of the rights of the ten studies. The first study, Asamadhisthan, discusses the relationship between dravya and bhava samadhi, and describes fifteen Niksepas: the name of the place, establishment, dravya, area, faith, upward, conduct, residence, restraint, acceptance, warrior, immovable, counting, institution (sanghan), and bhava. The second study considers four Niksepas, starting with the name Shabala. The third study analyzes Ashatana. The fourth study, while considering the Niksepa perspective on "Gani" and "Sampada," states that Gani and Guni are synonymous. Prachar is the first Ganisthan. Sampada has two divisions: dravya and bhava. The body is dravya sampada, and conduct is bhava sampada. The fifth study considers the Niksepa perspective on chitta samadhi. There are four types of samadhi. When the mind is free from attachment and aversion, and is absorbed in focused attention, then it is bhava samadhi. The sixth study considers the Niksepa perspective on the Upasaka and the image. There are four types of Upasaka: dravyopasaka, tadarthopaasaka, mohopaasaka, and bhavopaasaka. Only one whose life is illuminated by the light of Samyagdarshan can be a Bhavopaasaka. Here, the eleventh [60] ...

---------------------------
This is a representation of the paradigms. In the seventh study, while contemplating the Shraman pratima, five types have been mentioned: Samadhi pratima, Upadhan pratima, Viveka pratima, Prati-sanlin pratima, and Viveka pratima. In the eighth study, while contemplating the Paryushana kalpa, Parivasana, Paryushana, Payu Pashmana, Varshavas, Pratham-Samavasaran, Sthapana, and Jyestha Graha have been described as synonyms. The Shraman resides in one place during Varshavas and wanders for the remaining months. In the ninth study, while considering the Mohaniya-sthan, its synonyms for Moha have been mentioned: Pap, Bary, Vaer, Pank, Panak, Kshobh, Asat, Sang, Shalya, Atr, Nirati, and Dharty. In the tenth study, while contemplating the root causes of birth and death, the means to be liberated from them have been explained. After the Niyukti literature, the Bhashya literature was created, but no Bhashya was written on the Dasha-shruta-skandha. After the Bhashya literature, the Churni literature was created. This is a prose-based explanatory literature. It contains explanations written in pure Prakrit and a mixture of Prakrit and Sanskrit. The name of Churnikar Jinadasagani Mahttar is particularly noteworthy in the Churni literature. The Dasha-shruta-skandha-churni is based on the Dasha-shruta-skandha Niyukti. In this Churni, Mangalacharan has been done first. After that, the chapters of the ten studies have been discussed. It is simple and easy to understand. There are some differences between the original text and the Churni-approved text. This Churni is mainly in Prakrit language. The use of Sanskrit words and sentences is also seen here and there. After the Churni, the era of Sanskrit commentaries came. In that era, commentaries were written in Sanskrit on many Agamas. Brahmamuni (Brahmarshi) wrote a commentary on the Dasha-shruta-skandha, and Acharya Ghasilalji M. wrote an explanation in Sanskrit on the Dasha-shruta-skandha. Acharya Samrat Atmaramji M. wrote a commentary in Hindi on the Dasha-shruta-skandha. And Acharya Amolkarishiji M. wrote the first Hindi translation. The Dasha-shruta-skandha, including the original Niyukti and Churni, was published in Vikrama Samvat 2011 by Mani-vijayji Gani Granthamala, Bhavnagar. The Hindi translation of the Dasha-shruta-skandha by Amolkarishiji was published in Vir Samvat 2445 by Sukhdevsahay Jwalaprasad, Hyderabad. The Hindi commentary by Acharya Atmaramji M. was published in 1936 by the Jain Shastramala office, Saidmittha Bazaar, Lahore. The Dasha-shruta-skandha by Ghasilalji M. was published in 1960 by the Jain Shastroddhar Samiti, Rajkot, along with the Sanskrit explanation and Hindi translation. The original-based translation, under the name of Prayar-Dasha, was published in 1981 by Agam Anuyog Prakashan, Sanderao. Special meanings have also been given in it here and there. This edition has been done by the expert in Pragam literature, the great sage Muni Shri Kanhaiyalalji M. "Kamal". This edition is not only beautiful, but extremely beautiful. He has presented a neutral, thought-provoking solution to the mysteries of the Agam and the various tangled questions of Shramanachar, based on ancient explanatory literature. In a few words [ 61 ]

Clarifying the subject is a characteristic of the editor Muni. His profound scholarship is evident throughout this edition. The commentary on the Brihatkalpa is written in the style of the Brihatkalpaniyukti-Dasashrutaskandha, similar to the Brihatkalpaniyukti. It begins by paying homage to the Tirthankaras, reflecting on the various types of knowledge, and highlighting the inherent unity of knowledge and auspiciousness. It examines the Anuyoga through the seven deposits of name, establishment, substance, field, time, speech, and emotion. The Anuyoga is the post-existent yoga, or the subtle form of yoga. The four gateways to Anuyoga are the inception, deposit, following, and perspective of the Kalpa. The wise, learned, long-ordained, contemplative, unwavering, established, non-hearsay, knowledgeable, authorized, and emotionally transformative saint is the one who studies and contemplates the Kalpa and its practical application. It includes a detailed description of the Tal-Prlamb, and prescribes atonement for its acceptance. It also examines the deposits of terms like village, city, Kheda, Karbatak, Madamb, port, Akar, Dronamukha, Nigam, capital, Pashram, investment, restraint, announcement, and Anshika. It sheds light on the Jainic and the non-Jainic perspectives. While considering the term "Aarya," it examines the twelve deposits of name, establishment, substance, field, caste, lineage, karma, language, craft, knowledge, vision, and character. Wandering in the Aarya field leads to the growth of knowledge, vision, and character. Wandering in non-Aarya fields increases the possibility of acquiring various faults. This fact is clarified by giving the example of Skandacharya. It also instructs on wandering in non-Aarya fields for the growth of knowledge, vision, and character, and provides the example of King Samprati. The conduct, thoughts, food, and movement of the Shramans and Shramanis are beautifully described in a concise manner. The entire commentary is based on the deposit method. This Niyukti is not independent but is integrated into the Brihatkalpa Bhashya. The Brihatkalpa-Ladhubhashya-Brihatkalpa Ladhubhashya is a very important work of Sanghadasagani. It elaborates on the verses of the Brihatkalpasutra. Despite being a Ladhubhashya, it has 6490 verses. It is divided into six objectives. The Bhashya begins with a detailed preface, which has 805 verses. This Bhashya contains a collection and assessment of important cultural material from India. Dr. Motichand, in his book "Sarthavah," has beautifully assessed "Travelers and Sarthavahs" based on some aspects of this cultural material. Its content is particularly useful for studying ancient Indian culture and civilization. The heart-touching, subtle, and logical analysis of the conduct of Jain Shramans is a significant feature of this Bhashya. The preface discusses the auspiciousness, the concept of Shrutagyan in the Panchakgyan, the process of attaining Samyaktva, and the nature of Praupashmik, Sasvadan, Kshayopashmik, Vedak, and Kshayik Samyaktva. It explains the nature of Anuyoga and examines it through twelve types of gateways, including deposits. It contemplates the Kalpavyavahar from various perspectives, using examples to clarify the subject matter. The commentary on the first objective explains various types of faults and atonement related to the Tal-Vriksh, exceptions related to the acceptance of Tal-Prlamb, reasons for Shramans and Shramanis to travel to other countries and its method, the rules and regulations for the illness of Shramans, and the types of texts for Vaishyas. It explains the conduct of Shramans and Shramanis in special circumstances like famine, etc. [ 62 ]

This text describes the method of living in the field of non-attachment, its 144 transgressions and related atonement, etc. It discusses terms like village, city, hamlet, Karbatak, Madamb, port, rampart, Dronamukha, Nigama, capital, ashram, investment, Sambadha, Anshika, Putbhadan, Shankar, etc. It describes the Nakshatra month, Chandra month, Ritu month, Aditya month and Abhidhit month. It discusses the actions of Jinakalpika and Sthavirakalpika, Samvasarana, Tirthankara, Ganadhara, Aharakshariri, Anuttardeva, Chakravarti, Baldeva, Vasudeva, etc., their auspicious and inauspicious karma natures, the transformation of the Tirthankara's language into different languages, Afnagrigha, Rathiyamukha, Shringatak, Chatushk, Chatvar, Antaraphna, etc. It sheds light on the potential faults that may befall the Shramanis residing in the Upashrayas built in those places. The commentator has described twelve types of Dravya Gram (1) Uttanakamallaka, (2) Avaang Mukhamallaka, (3) Samputamallaka, (4) Uttanakhandamallaka, (5) Avaang Mukhkhandamallaka, (6) Samputakhandamallaka, (7) Bhiti, (8) Padali, (9) Valabhi, (10) Akshatak, (11) Ruchka, (12) Kashyapak. Jinakalpika Munis exist only during the time of Tirthankara, Ganadhara and Kevali. The Samachari of Jinakalpika Muni is described through twenty-seven doors: (1) Shruta, (2) Sanhanan, (3) Upsarga, (4) Atanka, (5) Vedana, (6) Katijan, (7) Sthandila, (8) Vasati, (9) Kiyaachir, (10) Ucchaar, (11) Prasravan, (12) Avakash, (13) Trunphalaka, (14) Sanrakshanata, (15) Sansthapanata, (16) Prabhriti, (17) Praagni, (18) Deep, (19) Avadhan, (20) Vatsyaksha, (21) Bhikshacharya, (22) Panak, (23) Lepalepa, (24) Lepa, (25) Prachaaml (26) Pratima, (27) Masakalp / While contemplating the state of Jinakalpika, light has been shed through these doors: field, time, character, pilgrimage, cycle, scripture, Veda, Kalpa, Linga, Leshya, meditation, calculation, acceptance, renunciation, shaving, atonement, cause, Nishpratikarma and devotion. After this, the nature of Pariharavishuddhik and Yathalandhik Kalpa is explained. The pravrajya, education, earning, irregular residence and outcome of Sthavirakalpika are all the same as Jinakalpika. While shedding light on the conduct of Shramanas, it describes the time of conduct, the area suitable or unsuitable for residence and sustenance of the Gachchha before conducting, the selection of supervisors, how to travel for the transcription of the area, the conduct route and Sthandila land, water, resting place, alms, residence, disturbance, etc., the method of entering the transcribable area, examining the inner mind of the humans there through alms, the knowledge of ease and difficulty in obtaining alms, medicine, etc., the permission of the head of the residence before conducting, seeing auspicious omens before conducting, etc. The Samachari of Sthavirakalpika sheds light on these points: 1. Transcription - the time of transcription of clothes, etc., the faults of transcription and their atonement / 2. Exit - the time of exiting the Upashraya / 3. Prabhriti - whether or not to stay in the house prepared for the householder. The related method and atonement / [63]

In the Vyavshaman Prakrut Sutra, it is Considered that if There is Discord Among Shramans, Then One Should Adopt Upshaman (Pacification) and Calm the Distress. One Who Adopts Upshaman is Paradharka (One Who Acts for the Benefit of Others), and One Who Does Not is Viradhak (One Who Acts for Self-Interest). The Acharya is Subject to Prāyaścitta for Neglecting to Pacify Distress Among Shraman and Shramani. The Method of Pacifying Disputes Among Them is Presented.**

The Four Nature Sutras state that monks and nuns should not travel from one village to another during the rainy season. If they do, they incur a penance. If there is an exceptional reason to travel, they should do so with great care. The Avagraha Sutra states that when a monk is going for alms or to the ground for sanitation, etc., and a householder requests him to take clothes, bowls, blankets, etc., he should take them and give them to the Acharya, etc., and use them only after obtaining their permission. The Ratribhakt Prakrut Sutra states that one should not consume food or drink at night or during the twilight hours, nor should one accept clothes, etc. Traveling at night and during the twilight hours is also prohibited. There are two types of paths: Panth and Marg. Panth is a path where there is nothing between, such as a village, town, etc., and Marg is a path where there are villages and towns in between. There are five types of merchants: Bhandi, Bahilka, Bharavah, Praudarik, and Karpatak. There are eight types of merchants and eight types of merchants' managers. For travel, the Aryan region is particularly suitable. The term "Aryan" has been considered in terms of twelve deposits, including name, etc. There are six Aryan castes: Ambastha, Kalinda, Vaideha, Vidak, Harit, and Tantun. There are also six types of Aryan families: Ugra, Bhog, Rajanya, Kshatriya, Jnat-Kaurava, and Ikshvaku. Further, in the discussion related to the Upashraya, the obstacles to the Upashraya have been elaborated upon. A monk should not stay in a place where grains like rice and barley, etc., are scattered, nor should he stay in a place where there are jars of liquor, jars of cold water, light, lamps, food, milk, yogurt, butter, etc. The method of abandoning the food offered by the Sagarik, the method of donating food brought from another place, the method of accepting food from the Samarik, the method of accepting food, utensils, etc., made for specific individuals, and the method of accepting the Rajoharan have been explained. There are five types of clothes: (1) Jangik, (2) Bhangik, (3) Sanak, (4) Potak, (5) Tiritpattak, and five types of Rajoharan: (1) Aunik, (2) Praustrik, (3) Sanak, (4) Vakchakchippak, (5) Mujchippak. Their nature and method of acceptance have been explained. The Third Uddeshak explains the method of entering the Upashraya for the Nirgranth and the Nirgranthis. The acceptance of clothes, etc., which are whole and not whole, different and not different, and the contemplation on the title of newly initiated monks and nuns have been discussed. The method of accepting the title, the method of bowing, etc., have been established. While contemplating on the violence and non-violence involved in tearing clothes, the violence of substance and the violence of feeling have been considered. The more intense the passion, etc., in violence, the more intense the karmic bondage will be. The karmic bondage due to knowledge and ignorance in the violent, the diversity of the karmic bondage due to the diversity of the authority, etc., have been contemplated. The Fourth Uddeshak lays down the penance for manual labor, etc. The feeling of sexual desire can never be free from passion, etc. Therefore, it is not an exception. The initiation of Pandak, etc., into the order is prohibited. The Fifth Uddeshak sheds light on the Gachcha, the obstacles related to the scriptures and the subject matter, the faults incurred by staying in the Gachcha with a troubled mind or by leaving one's own Gachcha and going to another Gachcha, and their penance, the faultless and doubtful night meals, the faults related to belching, vomiting, etc., and their penance, the effort for food, etc. Special rules and regulations have been laid down for nuns. The Sixth Uddeshak describes the use of faultless words and the non-use of false words, the penance for killing, etc., the removal of thorns, the faults caused by misinterpretation, the exception to penance. Monks and nuns should use [65]

One should not deviate from the path. Understanding the reasons behind the deranged state of a nirgranthi, the text discusses the arrangements for their care and the rules and prohibitions regarding their treatment, etc. / For Shramanas, six types of Parimanu Vyadhat are considered - (1) Kautkucit (2) Moukharik (3) Chakshulol (4) Titinik (5) Ichchalom (6) Bhijjanidanakaran - their nature, faults, and exceptions, etc. are contemplated. _ In Kalpasthiti Prakrut, six types of Kalpasthitis are discussed - (1) Samayikkalpasthiti, (2) Chhedopasthanayakalpasthiti, (3) Nivishmanakalpasthiti, (4) Nivishtakayikakalpasthiti, (5) Jinkalpasthiti, (6) Stavirakalpasthiti. Chhedopasthanayakalpasthiti has ten Kalpas, including Achelky, Prauddeshik, etc. Its possessors and non-possessors are also contemplated. In this commentary, there are scattered Subhashitas, such as "O humans! Be vigilant always, the intellect of a vigilant human develops, he who is awake is always blessed." "Jagarah Nara Nicham, Jagaramanasas Badhate Buddhi / So Suvati // So Dhanam, Jo Jagati So Saya Dhanno //"  "Character and modesty are the ornaments of a woman. A woman's body cannot be adorned with ornaments like necklaces, etc. Her ornament is only character and modesty." "In a gathering, speech devoid of good conduct and improper is not considered praiseworthy." Thus, this commentary presents a very subtle analysis of the principles and thoughts of Shramanas from a logical perspective. It also sheds considerable light on the social, cultural, religious, and political conditions of that era. There is beautiful analysis from a psychological perspective in many places. This 'Grantharatna' holds an unparalleled and unique place not only in the history of Jain literature but also in Indian literature. Brihatkalpachurni is the primary source and Laghubhashya for this Churni. / The initial part of Dasashrutaskandhachurni and Brihatkalpachurni is almost similar. Linguists believe that Dasashrutaskandhani is older than Brihatkalpachurni. It is possible that both these Churnis belong to the same Acharya. This Churni has a preface and six Uddeshak. / In the beginning, the nature of knowledge is contemplated. / While stating that Abhidhan and Abhidhey are sometimes different and sometimes the same, six synonyms for the word 'Vriksh' are given in different languages. What is called 'Vriksh' in Sanskrit is called 'Rukkh' in Prakrit, 'Prodan' in Magadhi, 'Kar' in Lat, 'Chor' in Tamil, and 'Idaku' in Andhra. The Churni mentions texts like Tattvarthadhigama, Visheshavashyakbhashya, Karmaprakriti, Mahakala, Govindaniyanti, etc. The language is Sanskrit-mixed Prakrit. The author's name is not mentioned anywhere in the Churni.

This commentary is on the *Brihatkalpa* and its *Niyukti* written by Bhadrabaahu Swami and the *Laghubhashya* written by Sanghdasagani. Acharya Malayagiri could only write his commentary up to verse 606 of the *Peethika*. He did not write any further commentary. The remaining commentary was completed by Acharya Kshemakirti, as acknowledged by Kshemakirti himself. At the beginning of the commentary, the commentator has paid homage to Jinesvara Deva and remembered his Sadgurudev, and expressed gratitude to the commentator and the *Churnikara*. The commentator has written about the creators of the *Brihatkalpa* and *Vyavahara Sutra* that the fourteen *Purvadhara* Bhadrabaahu Swami created the *Kalpa* and *Vyavahara* for the benefit of the *Shramanas* so that there would be no interruption in the *Prayaschitta*. He created the *Niyukti* to clarify the profound secrets of the *Sutra*, and the commentator created the *Bhashya* for those of limited intellect who lack brilliance. The *Niyukti* and *Bhashya* both reveal the meaning of the *Sutra* and thus became one text. The commentary uses Prakrit verses as quotations and cites Prakrit stories to make the subject matter easier to understand. The present *Malayagiri Vritti* has 4600 verses. Thus, we see that Acharya Malayagiri was a profound scholar of the scriptures. The deep discussion and analysis of various philosophies found in his commentaries is not available anywhere else. He was a great philosopher, renowned commentator, and a great lecturer of his time. His ability to present the profound secrets of the *Agamas* in a logical style was amazing and unique. Saubhagyasagar wrote a commentary on the *Brihatkalpa* in Sanskrit. The *Brihatkalpa Niyukti*, *Laghubhashya*, and the commentaries of Malayagiri and Kshemakirti were published from 1933 to 1941 by the Jain Pratmananda Sabha, Bhavnagar, Saurashtra. The present text was edited by Chaturvijayji and Punyavijayji. This edition can be considered excellent from the perspective of editing skills. The *Brihatkalpa* was published with a commentary by an unknown commentator by the Samyakgyan Pracharak Mandal, Jodhpur. In 1923, it was published with German commentary, etc., by W. Schubring, Leipzig, 1905: original only in Nagari script - Pune, 1923. In 1915, Dr. Jivraj Ghelabhai Doshi published it with a Gujarati translation from Ahmedabad, and Acharya Amolakrishiji M. published it with a Hindi translation by Sukhdevsahay Jwalaprasad Jauhari, Hyderabad. In 1977, it was published by Agam Anuyog Prakashan, Sanderao, under the name "Kappsuttam" with a literal translation and special meaning. The present editor of this text is the Agam Anuyog Pravartak Muni Shri Kanhaiyalalji M. 'Kamal'. His word-by-word translation and editing are captivating. Based on ancient commentary literature, the editor Muni has attempted to clarify many hidden secrets. The *Vyavahara Sutra* commentary literature is a vibrant commentary on the practice of *Shraman* life. In the *Vyavahara Niyukti*, the *Utsarga* and *Apavada* are as follows: 1. Shri Malayagiri Prabhavo, Yam Kattu Mupakramant Matimantaha / Sa Kalpashastra Teeka Maya Anusandhoyate Alpadhiyaa / - Brihatkalpa Peethikavritti, p. 177 [67]

This is a discussion. There is also a commentary on this appointment. Which is more detailed. The appointments of the Brihatkalpa and Vyavahar are very similar in terms of style, sentiment and language. The facts and principles of sadhana are almost the same in both. This appointment has been merged into the commentary. We have already mentioned in the past that the name of the author of the Vyavahar Bhashya has not yet been known. Like the Brihatkalpa Bhashya, this Bhashya also sheds light on the conduct and thoughts of the Nirgrantha and Nirgranthis. First of all, the nature of Vyavahar, Vyavhari and Vyavhartavya has been discussed in the preface. From the point of view of faults in conduct, the meaning, difference, cause, special study, Tadah Parshad etc. of atonement have been discussed and many examples have also been given to clarify the subject. After this, contemplation has been done from the point of view of deposit on the words like Bhikshu, Masparihar, Sthanapratisevana, Alochana etc. There is a separate provision of atonement for Atikram, Vyatikrama, Atichar, Anachar related to Adhakarma. The purity of both Mulaguna and Uttaraguna is done by atonement. For Atikram, there is a provision of Masaguru and Kalalghu atonement, for Atichar, Tapoguru and Kalaguru and for Anachar, Chaturguru atonement. Pindavishuddhi Samiti Bhavana Tap Pratima and Abhiggraha are all in Uttaraguna. They have forty-two, eighty, twenty-five, twelve, twelve and four differences respectively. There are two types of the man who does atonement: Nirgat and Vartaman. Those who have crossed the Atikrant by Tapohr atonement are Nirgat and those who are present are Vartaman. Their differences have also been made. There are four types of men who are eligible for atonement: 1. Ubhaytara who can serve others while practicing the sadhana of restraint and penance. 2. Atmatara - who can only do penance. 3. Paratara - who can only serve. 4. Anyatara - who can only practice one of penance and service at a time. Malochana Palochanaha and Alochak do not happen without. Alochanaha is itself Acharavan, Pradharavan, Vyavharavan, Apvridak, Prakurbhi, Niryapak, Apayadarshi and Aparishrabi, endowed with these qualities. The Alochak is also endowed with these ten qualities: Jatisampanna, Kulsampanna, Vinayasampanna, Gyanasampanna, Darshanasampanna, Charanasampanna, Kshata, Danta, Amayi and Apachchattpi. Along with this, the Bhashyakar has also contemplated on the faults of Alochana, the substance that is the subject of it, etc., the method of giving atonement, etc. In the description of Pariharatapas, the analysis of service has been done and examples of Subhadra and Mugawati have also been given. The five types of Aroopana: Prasthapanika, Sthapita, Kritsna, Akritsna and Hadhada have been told and discussed in detail. There is a description of various types of atonements for leaving the Gachch due to laxity and rejoining the Gachch. The nature of Parsvastha, Yathachchanda, Kushil, Pravasanna and Sansakta has been highlighted. [68]

While discussing the conduct of Shramans, solitary conduct has been prohibited and the faults associated with it have been described.  The text lays down the rules for serving ascetics of various types and those afflicted with diseases, highlighting the psychological approach to serving those with agitated minds (Kshiptachitt) and those with excited minds (Deeptachitt). The three causes of an agitated mind are attachment, fear, and insult. The cause of an excited mind is honor. When honored, pride arises in such a person. Due to this pride, they become excited (Deeptachitt) after defeating their enemies. The main difference between an agitated mind and an excited mind is that an agitated mind usually remains silent, while an excited mind speaks even without purpose. The commentator has considered the qualifications of those who hold the positions of Ganavachchedak, Pracharaya, Upadhyaya, Pravartak, Sthavir, Pravatini, etc. Those who are knowledgeable in the eleven Angas, knowledgeable in the Navam Purva, are Kritayogi, Bahushruta, knowledgeable in many Agamas, experts in Sutra-artha, are patient, are Shruta-nigharsha, and are Mahajan, are the only ones who can hold the distinguished positions of Pracharaya, etc. While discussing the rules and regulations regarding the conduct of Shramans, it has been stated that how many saints should an Acharya, Upadhyaya, etc. stay with at least, etc. various rules and regulations have been described. An Acharya and Upadhyaya have five duties, which Shramans should pay special attention to: 1. Cleaning their feet when they go out. 2. Offering them a clean place for their excretions. 3. Following their wishes. 4. Staying with them inside the shelter. 5. Going out with them. A Shraman can initiate a woman and after initiation, she should be handed over to a Sadhvi. A Sadhvi cannot initiate any man. She should be sent to a qualified Shraman for initiation. A Shramani who has been initiated in one group should not be initiated into another group. She should be initiated where she wants to stay, but there is no such rule for Shramans. An Upadhyaya with three years of initiation can become an Acharya with five years of initiation. The best place for Varshavas is described as one where there is not much mud, where there is not a large number of two-sense and other beings, where the land is fertile, where there are two or three habitable settlements, where there is an abundance of juice, where there are many physicians, where medicines are easily available, where there is an abundance of grain, where the king rules his subjects properly, where there are few hypocritical saints, where begging is easy, and where there is no obstacle to self-study. Shramans should not stay where there are many dogs. While contemplating the qualities and defects of those who take initiation, the commentary states that some individuals are inherently flawed due to their country's nature. A person born in Andhra is cruel. A person born in Maharashtra is talkative, and a person born in Kosala is inherently wicked. It is very rare to find such qualities absent in individuals.

The commentary further explains the method of collecting and returning materials for purposes like lying down, etc. It sheds light on the limitations of diet, stating that a monk who eats eight morsels is called an *alpahāri*, one who eats twelve, sixteen, twenty-four, thirty-one, and thirty-two morsels is called an *apārḍhāri*, *arḍhāri*, *prāptāvamoudarya*, and *pramaṇāhāri* respectively. The ninth *uddesaka* discusses the food intake of monks in relation to their relatives, friends, and other visitors, highlighting various paradigms. The tenth *uddesaka* focuses specifically on *yavamādhyapratimā* and *vanamādhyapratimā*. It also explains five types of conduct, the method of *bāladikshā*, ten types of *vaiyāvṛtti*, etc. Stories of *Prāyaṁ rakshit*, *Ārya kālak*, King *Sātavāhana*, *Pradyot*, *Murunda*, *Cāṇakya*, *Cilātaputra*, *Avanti*, *Sukumāla*, *Rohiney*, *Prārya samudra*, *Ārya mangu*, etc. are included. This commentary is significant in many ways. A *cūṇī* was also written on conduct. After the *cūṇī*, *Ācārya Malayagiri* wrote a *vṛtti* on conduct. The *vṛtti* clearly reflects the profound scholarship of *Ācārya Malayagiri*. The depth of the subject, the simplicity of the language, the elegance of the style, and the clarity of the analysis are noteworthy. The beginning of the text has a preface in the form of a *pīṭhikā*, which discusses topics like *kalpa*, conduct, faults, atonement, etc. The commentator, with devotion, has paid homage to *Arhat Ariṣṭanemi*, his revered guru, and the commentator of the *vyavahārasūtra*, etc. The commentator, while clarifying the difference between the *Bṛhatkalpa* and *vyavahāra*, writes that the study of *kalpa* deals with atonement, but it does not include the method of giving atonement, whereas the *vyavahāra* includes both the method of giving atonement and the method of criticism. This is the special feature of *vyavahāra* compared to *Bṛhatkalpa*. Analyzing *vyavahāra*, *vyavahāri*, and *vyavahartavya*, he writes that *vyavahāri* is the doer, *vyavahāra* is the cause, and *vyavahartavya* is the action. The cause-like *vyavahāra* is of five types: *prāgama*, *śruta*, *ājñā*, *dhāraṇā*, and *jīta*. The *cūṛṇikāra* calls all five types of *vyavahāra* as *karaṇa*. The commentator considers *sūtra*, *artha*, *jītakalpa*, *mārga*, *nyāya*, *apsytavya*, *prācarita*, and *vyavahāra* as synonymous. One who knows the essence of *vyavahāra* and has the ability to explain the nature of *vyavahāra* to others is called a *gītartha*. The use of *vyavahāra* is for one who is a *gītartha*. Both the giver of atonement and the receiver of atonement should be *gītartha*. There are four meanings of atonement: *pratisevā*, *manyajanā*, *grāropaṇā*, and *parikūcanā*. There are ten types of atonement in the form of *pratisevā*. (1) *Ālocana*, (2) *pratikramāṇā*, (3) *tadu-bhaya*, (4) *viveka*, (5) *utsarga*, (6) *tapa*, (7) *chedha*, (8) *mūla*, (9) *anavasthāpya*, and (10) *pārāñcīka*. These ten types of atonement have been discussed in detail. If we compare these types of atonement with the atonement method found in the *Vinayapitaka*, we will find a surprising similarity. It is essential that the officer or *ācārya* who gives atonement be a *bahuśruta* and serious. In front of each, 1. *Vinayapitaka* diagnosis [70]

Page #72:
---------------------------
Criticism is prohibited. Both criticism and atonement should be done in front of a worthy person, so that it can remain confidential. / In the Buddhist tradition, there is a provision for atonement in front of the community of monks. The Vinaya Pitaka states that on the Krishna Chaturdashi and Purnima of every month, all monks should gather in the Uposathagar. The Tathagata Buddha told his successor Sangha. Therefore, a learned monk is appointed to the post of head of the assembly and the Patimokkha is recited. At the end of each case, the question is asked whether all the monks present are pure in the said matters? If any monk wants to criticize his fault in this regard, the Sangha contemplates on it and purifies him. The same question is repeated for the second and third time. After everyone's approval, one by one cases are read further. Similarly, the nuns recite the Bhikkhuni Patimokkha. It is true that the atonement methods of both traditions are different. But both have psychological aspects. Both traditions expect the purity of heart and simplicity of thoughts of the seeker who is atoning. In the first objective, two types of atonement are mentioned: original atonement and subsequent atonement. / Original atonement is of five types: violence, falsehood, stealing, sexual misconduct, and attachment. Subsequent atonement is of ten types. Subsequent atonement is in the form of future, past, with a limit, controlled, concrete, abstract, quantified, complete, symbolic, and non-acceptance. In the above words, the ten types of subsequent atonement are: Pindavishuddhi, five samitis, external penance, internal penance, Bhikshapratima, and Abhigha. Original atonement and subsequent atonement are also of two types: Darya and Kalpya. Atonement without reason is Dapka and atonement with reason is Kalpya. The commentator has presented discussions at various places to clarify the subject. / The present commentary has 34625 verses. After the commentary, short commentaries explaining the meanings of the Pragama in simple and easy-to-understand language have been written, whose language is a mixture of ancient Gujarati and Rajasthani. This is known as Balavabodh and Tabba. / Dharmasimha Muni of the Stanakvasi tradition has also written Tabba on the Vyavahar Sutra, but it is still unpublished. The Hindi translation of the Vyavahar Sutra by Acharya Amolkarishiji Maharaj has been published. Jivraj Ghelabhai Doshi has also published a Gujarati translation. Shubing Leipzig wrote it in 1918 with German commentary. / Which was published in 1923 by the Jain Sahitya Samiti, Pune. Pujya Ghasilalji M. has published the Cheda Sutras only with Sanskrit commentary. The Agam Anuyog Prakashan, Sanderao, published the Vyavahar Sutra in 1980. Which was edited by Agammarmna Muni Shri Kanhaiyalalji M. "Kamal". The present editor, Muni Shri Kanhaiyalalji M. "Kamal", had earlier edited and published the three Ved Sutras: Prayar-Dasha, Kappasuttam, and Bahar Suttam. Based on the same, the present three Agamas are being edited and published in more detail. Nishita has already been published. This publication of the four Cheda Sutras with original, meaning, and discussion is glorious in itself. With the publication of these three Pragama, [71]

The publication of the thirty-two *Pāgamas* accepted by the *Sthānakavāsī* tradition is also being completed from this present *Āgama* series. The commendable vision of the late revered *Yuvacharya* Shri Madhukar Muni Ji Maharaj has been given concrete form due to many editor *Munis*, *Mahāsatis* and scholars. This is a matter of supreme joy. The *Chhedasūtras* elaborate on the code of conduct of the *Shramanas*. The *Chhedasūtras* describe the path of *utsarga* and *apvāda*. I was thinking of writing about these in great detail, but due to the responsibility of the *Shramanasangha* system, I have been extremely busy with that work and due to the very crowded environment, I could not write. I have this thought myself. I have written a very brief introductory preface. I hope that the discerning reader will understand the essence that remains in the *Āgama*. As a result of the boundless grace of the great *Rāshṭrasanta* *Āchāryasamrāt* Shri Anand Rishi Ji Maharaj and the most revered *Pūjya* *Gurudev* *Upādhyāya* Shri Pushkar Muni Ji Maharaj, I have been able to do some work in the field of literature and I am satisfied that I have been able to give concrete form to the inspiration of the late *Yuvacharya* Shri Madhukar Muni Ji Maharaj by writing prefaces on *Āgama* literature. I hope, not only hope but have full faith, that the discerning readers will enrich their lives by studying the *Āgamas*. *Upāchārya* Devendra Muni Kot, Pipāḍacity, Date 22-10-91 [72]

1. It is not permissible for **Niggranthas** or **Niggranthis** to consume unripe **Tal-Palamb** that is not cut.
2. It is permissible for **Niggranthas** or **Niggranthis** to consume unripe **Tal-Palamb** that is cut.
3. It is permissible for **Niggranthas** to consume ripe **Tal-Palamb** that is cut or uncut.
4. It is not permissible for **Niggranthis** to consume ripe **Tal-Palamb** that is uncut.
5. It is permissible for **Niggranthis** to consume ripe **Tal-Palamb** that is cut; however, it is permissible only if it is cut according to the prescribed method, not if it is cut in an unprescribed manner. 

The term "**Tal-Palamb**" in the sutra refers to all fruits. According to the principle of "**Ek-grahan-sarva-sajaati-grahan**" (the consumption of one implies the consumption of all similar things), the term "**Tal-Palamb**" includes fruits like banana, mango, pomegranate, etc., in addition to **Tal-fruit**. Similarly, considering the term "**Palamb**" as **Anta-Deepak** (the consumption of the end implies the consumption of the beginning and middle), roots, tubers, and stems are also included. In the first and second sutras, the term "**Am**" refers to unripe, "**Abhinna**" refers to uncut, and "**Bhinna**" refers to cut.

Page #82:
---------------------------
The term 'abhinna' in the third, fourth and fifth sutras of the Bahutkalpasutra has the meaning of 'unbroken' and the term 'pakva' has the meaning of 'ripe' as transformed by a weapon. In the commentary, the term 'talapralamb' refers to the ten parts of a tree, namely: 1. root, 2. tuber, 3. trunk, 4. bark, 5. branch, 6. twig, 7. leaf, 8. flower, 9. fruit and 10. seed. (Brihatkalpa Udd. 1, Commentary verse 854)

The combined meaning of these sutras is that a sadhu or sadhvi cannot consume the following, whether ripe or unripe, and whether transformed by a weapon or not: 1. root, 2. tuber, 3. trunk, 4. bark, 5. branch, 6. twig, 7. leaf, 8. flower, 9. fruit and 10. seed. However, if these parts are transformed by a weapon, then a sadhu or sadhvi can consume them.

The commentary explains the four terms used in these sutras, 'aam', 'pakva', 'bhinna' and 'abhinna', in terms of both substance and essence. It states that if something is ripe in essence or different in essence, and if it is a talapralamb transformed by a weapon, then a monk can consume it.

The first sutra states that unripe talapralambs that are not transformed by a weapon are not to be consumed, while the second sutra states that the same talapralambs are to be consumed if they are transformed by a weapon (bhinna). Just as the second sutra states that unripe talapralambs are to be consumed if they are different in substance and essence, the third sutra states that ripe talapralambs, whether different or unbroken, are to be consumed by a monk.

The fourth sutra prohibits a sadhvi from consuming ripe talapralambs that are unbroken in substance and essence. The fifth sutra prohibits a sadhvi from consuming large, long pieces of ripe talapralambs, but states that small pieces are acceptable.

The reason for prohibiting a sadhvi from consuming unbroken or long pieces of fruit, even though they are not sentient, is as follows: The sight of an unbroken piece of fruit like a banana, or a long piece of tuber like a sweet potato or root, can arouse desire in the mind of a non-ordained woman, and she may engage in sexual activity, which would harm her discipline and health. Therefore, a non-ordained woman is prohibited from consuming unbroken fruit or tubers.

Similarly, she is also prohibited from consuming long pieces of fruit like bananas, or tubers like roots, that have been broken in an improper way, and which could arouse lust. However, a sadhvi can consume fruit or tubers that have been broken in a proper way, into such small pieces that they cannot arouse the aforementioned desire.

Fruit that falls from a tree on its own when ripe, or that is plucked from the tree when ripe, is called 'dravyapakva'. This 'dravyapakva' fruit is also connected to a sentient, living seed, kernel, etc. Therefore, when it is broken open with a weapon, the kernel, etc., is removed, or if it contains many seeds, ...

If a living being has been completely rendered lifeless by being cooked, boiled, or roasted in fire, etc., then it is considered **भावपक्व-शस्त्र-परिणत** (fully ripened by the weapon) and acceptable. Conversely, if there is a possibility of it still being sentient even after being cut, pierced, or cooked in fire, etc., then it is considered **भाव से अपक्व-शस्त्र-अपरिणत** (not fully ripened by the weapon) and unacceptable. For detailed discussion and the fourfold analysis, one should refer to the **भाष्य** (commentary) and **वृत्ति** (explanation).

It is prescribed that **निर्ग्रन्थों** (Jain monks) should stay in the following places for one month during the **हेमन्त** (winter) and **ग्रीष्म** (summer) seasons: 1. **ग्राम** (village), 2. **नगर** (town), 3. **खेट** (field), 4. **कर्बट** (a type of settlement), 5. **मडंब** (a type of settlement), 6. **पत्तन** (port), 7. **प्राकर** (walled city), 8. **द्रोणमुख** (a type of settlement), 9. **निगम** (a type of settlement), 10. **पाश्रम** (a type of settlement), 11. **सन्निवेश** (a type of settlement), 12. **सम्बाध** (a type of settlement), 13. **घोष** (a type of settlement), 14. **अंशिका** (a type of settlement), 15. **पुटभेदन** (a type of settlement), and 16. **राजधानी** (capital city), both with **सपरिक्षेप** (with a surrounding wall) and **अबाहिरिक** (without a surrounding wall).

It is prescribed that **निर्ग्रन्थों** should stay in the following places for two months during the **हेमन्त** and **ग्रीष्म** seasons: 1. **ग्राम** (village) to 16. **राजधानी** (capital city), both with **सपरिक्षेप** (with a surrounding wall) and **सबाहिरिक** (with a surrounding wall and an outer settlement). One month should be spent inside the **ग्राम** (village) etc., and one month outside. While staying inside, **भिक्षाचर्या** (begging for food) should be done inside, and while staying outside, **भिक्षाचर्या** should be done outside.

It is prescribed that **निर्गन्थीणं** (Jain nuns) should stay in the following places for two months during the **हेमन्त** and **ग्रीष्म** seasons: 1. **ग्राम** (village) to 16. **राजधानी** (capital city), both with **सपरिक्षेप** (with a surrounding wall) and **अबाहिरिक** (without a surrounding wall).

It is prescribed that **निर्गन्थीणं** should stay in the following places for four months during the **हेमन्त** and **ग्रीष्म** seasons: 1. **ग्राम** (village) to 16. **राजधानी** (capital city), both with **सपरिक्षेप** (with a surrounding wall) and **सबाहिरिक** (with a surrounding wall and an outer settlement). Two months should be spent inside the **ग्राम** (village) etc., and two months outside. While staying inside, **भिक्षाचर्या** (begging for food) should be done inside, and while staying outside, **भिक्षाचर्या** should be done outside.

[130] [Brihatkalpa Sutra 9. It is prescribed for Nirgranthis to stay in a village with a surrounding wall (Sapariskhepa) and a village without a surrounding wall (Sabaharik) for four months during the winter and summer seasons. Two months should be spent inside the village and two months outside the village. While staying inside the village, it is prescribed to beg for alms only inside the village. While staying outside the village, it is prescribed to beg for alms only outside the village. Explanation: In every region, there are many settlements as mentioned in the sutras. These settlements are of two types: 1. A village that has a surrounding wall made of stone, brick, mud, wood, bamboo, thorns, or a moat, pond, river, pit, or mountain, and the houses are located only inside the wall, not outside, is called "Sapariskhepa" and "Abaharik". 2. A village that has a surrounding wall of any of the aforementioned types, but also has houses located outside the wall, is called "Sapariskhepa" and "Sabaharik". The monks and nuns stay in both types of settlements. During the rainy season, they are prescribed to stay anywhere for four months. But where and for how long should they stay for the remaining eight months? This is prescribed in the four sutras mentioned. The statement in the sutra regarding begging for alms in a village with a surrounding wall (Sapariskhepa) and a village without a surrounding wall (Sabaharik) for twice the prescribed time means that if a monk begs for alms in a particular part of the village, he should stay in that part for the prescribed time. But if he begs for alms in other parts of the village while staying in one part, he does not have to stay in those parts for the prescribed time. The word "village" used in the sutra is explained as follows: "Natthettha karo nagaram, khedam punam hoi dhulipagaran / Kambadagam tu kunagaram, madambagam savvato chhinnam // Jalpattanam cha yalpattanam cha, iti pattanam bhave duviham. Ayamai pragara khalu, donamuhum jal-thalpahenam / Nigama negamvaggo, vasai rayahani jahi raya. Tavasaamai asam, niweso satthaijattha va // Sanvaho sanvodhu, vasati jahin pavvayavisaamesu / Ghosou u goulam, ansiya u gamaddhamaiiya // Nanadisagayanam, bhijhati puda u jaththa bhandanam / Pudabheyanam tagam sankaro ya, kesinch kaayavyo." - Bah. Bhashya Gatha 1089-1093

## 132] [Brihatkalpa Sutra 16. Capital - The place where the king resides and governs is called the capital. 17. Sankara - A place that is a mixture of a village, a Khed, and a Pashram is called a 'Sankara'. / This word is not in the original text, it is in the commentary. The rules for the residence of Sadhus and Sadhvis in villages etc. are as follows: 10. It is not permissible for Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis to reside in the same village or capital with one entrance, one exit, and one enclosure. / 11. It is permissible for Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis to reside in the same village or capital with multiple enclosures, multiple entrances, and multiple exits. Discussion - The structure of villages etc. is of many types, such as: 1. One division, 2. Multiple divisions, 3. One entrance, 4. Multiple entrances, 5. One path, 6. Multiple paths. The difference between an entrance and a path should be understood as follows: 'Entrance' can be closed and opened from time to time, / but 'path' remains open always and does not have any entrance. If a village has only one division and only one path to enter and exit, and if monks have already stayed there, then Sadhvis should not stay there, or if Sadhvis are staying there, then monks should not stay there. If a village has multiple divisions and multiple paths, then both Sadhus and Sadhvis can stay together in separate shelters. If both Sadhus and Sadhvis happen to arrive in a village with one division or one path, then they should take food and leave, i.e., they should not stay there for a long time. The commentator has described in detail the faults that can arise from the stay of both in such villages or capitals. In short, it is as follows:

Page #87:
---------------------------
## First Objective] [133 1. When coming and going in the Uccara-Prasravanabhoomi and Swadhyaya Bhoomi, and during alms-round, frequent encounters with Nirgrantha-Nirgranthis in the alleys or at the gates of the village increase contact and lead to an increase in raga-bhava. Alternatively, seeing them coming and going in the same direction on the same path can cause many anxieties in the common people. According to the saying "Sangsargaja dosha-guna bhavanti", the loss of restraint is certain. In a single vagara, the entrances of the Nirgrantha-Nirgranthis' upashrayas should not be opposite each other. The entrance of one upashraya should be on the side of the other upashraya, or the entrance of one upashraya should be at the back of the other upashraya. The entrance of one upashraya should be higher and the entrance of the other upashraya should be lower. Even if the upashrayas of Nirgrantha and Nirgranthis are in a straight line, many anxieties arise in the common people and there is a possibility of loss of their restraint. In Sutra 11, there is a provision for Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis to reside simultaneously in various upashrayas in villages etc. with many vagaras, many entrances, and many paths for coming and going. Because in villages etc. with many paths for coming and going, Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis do not meet frequently, there will be no increase in contact, no increase in raga-bhava, and no anxiety will arise in the common people. Therefore, in such villages etc., it should be considered faultless for sadhus and sadhvis to reside simultaneously. / The method and prohibition of sadhus and sadhvis residing in Apanagruh etc. 12. No kappi nigganthinam 1. Aavanagihansi va, 2. Ratthamuhansi va, 3. Singhaadagansi va, 4. Tiyansi va, 5. Chaukkasi va, 6. Chaccaransi va, 7. Antaravanansi va batthae. 13. Kappi nimganthanam praavanagihansi va jav antaravarnasi va vatthae / 12. Nirgranthis should not reside in 1. Apanagruh, 2. Rathamukh, 3. Shrigatak, 4. Trik, 5. Chatushk, 6. Chatvar, or 7. Antarapan. 13. Nirgranthas can reside in Apanagruh or Antarapan. / Explanation-1. The market is called 'Apan', the house or upashraya in the middle of it is called 'Apanagruh'. 2. Ratha means alley or neighborhood, the upashraya or house whose entrance faces the alley or neighborhood is called 'Rathamukh', or the house in front of which the alley begins is also called 'Rathamukh'. 3. A triangular place like a Singhade is called 'Shrigatak' / 4. The place where three alleys or three roads meet is called 'Trik' /

Page #88:
---------------------------
[134] [Brihatkalpa Sutra 5. A place where four paths meet is called a 'Chatushk'. 6. A place where six or more paths meet or where six or more paths lead from is called a 'Chatvar'. 7. The meaning of 'Antarapan' is the path of a market. / An Upashraya which has a market path on one or both sides is called 'Antarapan' / Or a house which has a shop on one side and a residence on the other is also called 'Antarapan'. Sadhvis should not stay in such Upashrayas or houses. Because there is a lot of coming and going of people in these places. Their eyes naturally fall on the Sadhvis, which can create many obstacles in the protection of their character. Therefore, it is safer for Sadhvis to stay inside a lane or in a safe place, leaving the highway or crossroads, etc., as mentioned in the sutras. / The sutra has been ordained for the Sadhu to stay in such places without objection. If there is an obstacle in the practices of self-study, meditation, etc., then the Sadhu should also not stay in such places. The law of prohibition for Sadhu-Sadhvi to stay in a place without a door 14. No Kampi Nigganthi Nam Avanguyaduvariye Uvassa Vatthae / Eg Patthar Am Anto Kiccha, Eg Patyar Am Bahim Kiccha, Pohadiy Chilimiliyagansi Evam Nam Kappi Vatthae. 15. Kappi Nigganthanam Avanguyaduvariye Uvassa Vatthae. 14. It is not proper for the Nigganthis to stay in an Upashraya with an uncovered (open) door / But it is proper for the Nigganthis to stay in an Upashraya with an uncovered door by putting a curtain (curtain) inside the door and another curtain outside, thus tying it in a way that it is Chilimilika (with a passage in between). 15. It is proper for the Nigganthas to stay in an Upashraya with an uncovered door. _ Discussion-The reason why Sadhvis are prohibited from staying in an Upashraya or house, etc., which does not have a door with a flap, is that seeing the open door, thieves, etc., can take the Sadhvis' clothes, utensils, etc., at night. Lustful men can also get in, they can harass the Sadhvis in many ways and even rape them. Dogs, etc., can also enter, etc., for these reasons, Sadhvis are prohibited from staying in an Upashraya or house with a door without a flap. But if, after searching, a house with doors is not found in a village, etc., and there is an opportunity to stay in a house with an open door, then the present sutra says that a curtain of cloth should be made inside and outside in such a way that no one's sight falls easily and there is also a way to come and go.

Page #89:
---------------------------
## First Objective] [In the 135th commentary, the method of covering the door is described as follows: The door should be closed from the outside with a mat made of bamboo or date palm, or a curtain of sun-tat, etc., and also from the inside. At night, both curtains should be tied with a peg, etc., at the top, middle, and bottom in such a way that no man can enter from outside. For further security, it is stated that a strong Sadhvi should guard the door throughout the night in turns, and the Ganini or Pravartini should arrange for the sleeping arrangement of the beautiful young Sadhvis, placing them in a circular pattern, with the melodious Sadhvis in the middle and the elderly Sadhvis in between. The Ganini should sleep in the middle and keep an eye on everyone. The reason for the provision of accommodation for the Sadhus in a place with an open door is clear, as there is no possibility of such fear for them. If there is any fear of dogs, thieves, etc., the Sadhu should also take appropriate precautions. The prohibition and permission for the Sadhu-Sadhvi to possess a Ghatimaatraka is described in 16. Kappi Nigganthinam Antolittam Ghadimmattayam Dharittae Va Pariharittae Va / 17. No Kappi Nigganthanam Antolittam Ghadimmattayam Dharittae Va Pariharittae Va. 16. It is permissible for the Nirgranthis to keep and use a Ghatimaatraka with a coating on the inside. 17. It is not permissible for the Nirgranthis to keep and use a Ghatimaatraka with a coating on the inside. Discussion - The Agam permits the keeping of three types of Maatraka, namely 1. Uccaramaatraka, 2. Prasravanamaatraka, 3. Khelmaatraka. Here also, one type of Maatraka is described. In many previous sutras, prohibitions have been made for the protection of the Sadhvi's chastity, and here there is a prohibition for the protection of the Bhikshu's Brahmacharya. The Ghatimaatraka is a type of Prasravanamaatraka. Although it is permissible for both Sadhu and Sadhvi to keep the Prasravanamaatraka, this Maatraka has a specific shape, and the word "Ghati" describes that shape, which the commentator has interpreted as follows: "Ghatimaatra" - Ghatisansthanam Mrnmaybhajan Vishesh, Ghatika (Ghadiga) ke Prakar wala ek prakar ka Mitti ka Patra, Ghatimaatraka ka arth hai. Just as the long pieces of Talapralamb were prohibited for the Sadhvi because they resembled the male symbol, similarly, the Ghatimaatraka, due to its shape, resembles the female symbol.

Page #90:
---------------------------
This is prohibited for the Sadhu due to being a Brihatkalpasutra, and is ordained for the Sadhvi as it is not a hindrance. The word "Ghat" means "earthen pot" and "Ghati" or "Ghatika" means a small pot or a small pitcher. As per "Ghadiga" Ghatika-Mrinmaykullalika - Suy. Patra 118, Alpaparichit Saiddhantic Shabdakosh, page 381, the statement in the commentary and commentary about the mouth being tied with cloth and being made of clay also makes it possible to be like a pitcher, because only a vessel with a small mouth like a pitcher is tied with cloth. Otherwise, the vessel or unit is kept covered with cloth. Being made of clay can make it rough, which is not useful for Prashravan due to not drying quickly, therefore it is Kalpata for the Sadhvi to keep it smooth inside. The same vessel becomes a source of Vikar for the Sadhu due to its shape and touch because it is smooth inside. This method of prohibition should be understood in the same way for this unit. The commentary and commentary have stated that this is a general Prashravan unit and it is unnecessary for the Sadhu to keep it. But there are many mentions in the Agam of taking the general Prashravan unit. Therefore, it is relevant to understand here the Prashravan unit with a specific shape that is a hindrance to Brahmacharya. The ordinance to take Chilmilika (mosquito net) is 18. Kappi Nigganthan Va Nigganthin Va Chalchilimiliyam Dharittae Va Pariharittae Va. 18. It is Kalpata for the Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis to keep and use the Chel-Chilmilika. Discussion - Chilmilika is a local word, it is a type of cloth hut with the shape of a Chhola. It is of five types: 1. Sutramयी - made of threads of cotton etc., 2. Rajjumयी - made of thick threads of wool etc., 3. Valkalamयी - made of bark of San-Patasan etc., 4. Dandakamयी - made of bamboo-cane, 5. Katamयी - made of mat. The ordinance in the present Sutra is to keep the Chilmili made of cloth, not the others. Because it is not possible to carry them along during Vihar due to their heaviness or it is very laborious. The evidence of Chilmilika is said to be five hands long, three hands wide and three hands high. A Sadhu or Sadhvi can be well protected inside it.

Page #91:
---------------------------
## First Objective:

[137 Nishīthasūtra U. 1 states that the atonement for making a **chilimilikā** (mosquito net) from threads (sūtra) is to keep a cloth **chilimilikā**. Therefore, a monk can make a **chilimilikā** from a ready-made cloth or accept a ready-made cloth **chilimilikā**. This sūtra refers to a **chilimilikā** for wearing, which is a mosquito net. Sūtra 14 states that a **chilimilikā** should be made by tying a **prastāra** (sheet or curtain) inside and outside the door, leaving a passage in the middle. This **chilimilikā** made from two **prastāra** is different from the **chilimilikā** (mosquito net) mentioned in this sūtra. The commentator has instructed each monk and nun to keep one **chilimilikā** each. This means that during the rainy season and other seasons when small creatures like flies, mosquitoes, moths, etc., are born, sleeping inside the **chilimilikā** at night protects them. Similarly, it also protects them from various creatures during the rainy season and from wild animals when staying in forests during the wandering period. It also makes it easier to care for a sick monk. If there are many flies and mosquitoes, eating and drinking inside the **chilimilikā** also protects those creatures.

## Prohibition of Standing Near Water:

19. No **niggantha** or **nigganthī** should stand, sit, sleep, sleep, yawn, eat, drink, eat **khaima** or **saim** food, excrete, urinate, expel phlegm, nasal mucus, etc., study, perform **dharmajagarika** (meditation), or remain in **kayotsarga** near water.

## Explanation:

The place near a river, lake, or other water body where villagers or forest dwellers fetch water and where cows, buffaloes, and other animals or wild animals drink water is called **dakatira**. Alternatively, the edge of any water body is called **dakatira**. The prohibition of monks and nuns standing, sitting, eating, drinking, excreting, performing **dharmajagaran**, and remaining in **kayotsarga** near such a place has been explained by the **niyuktikāra**, commentator, and **tīkākara** for various reasons. Some of them are:

1. Women coming to fetch water may doubt the character of the monk.

Page #92:
---------------------------
[138] **Bahutkalpasutra 2.** Animals coming to drink water may be frightened and return without drinking, they may be obstructed from drinking water. **3.** Running around may also lead to **Jivadhat**. **4.** Wicked animals may kill the ascetic. **5.** Aquatic creatures in the water may be distressed upon seeing the ascetic. **6.** They run around in the water, which causes **viraadhana** to the aquatic creatures. **7.** The earth near the water's edge is **saccitta**, therefore, there is **viraadhana** to the creatures of the earth. **8.** People may be apprehensive about the ascetic drinking raw water or consuming it. Due to these reasons, the sutra prohibits staying near the water. **...** **20.** It is not appropriate for **Niggranthas** or **Nigganthis** to stay in a **saccitta** **upaashraya**. **21.** It is appropriate for **Niggranthas** or **Nigganthis** to stay in a **acitta** **upaashraya**. **20.** It is not appropriate for **Niggranthas** and **Nigganthis** to stay in a **saccitta** **upaashraya**. **21.** It is appropriate for **Niggranthas** and **Nigganthis** to stay in a **acitta** **upaashraya**. **Explanation:** In **upaashrayas** where there are paintings of gods and goddesses, men and women, and animals and birds playing in various ways, or other entertaining pictures, ascetics or nuns should not stay, because seeing them may arouse feelings of desire in their minds, and repeatedly looking at them may prevent them from concentrating on their **samyama** practices such as **svadhyay**, **dhyana**, and **pratilekhan**. Therefore, ascetics and nuns are prohibited from staying in **saccitta** **upaashrayas**. **...** **22.** It is not appropriate for **Niggranthis** to stay without the **nishra** of a **sagarik**. **23.** It is appropriate for **Niggranthis** to stay with the **nishra** of a **sagarik**. **24.** It is appropriate for **Niggranthas** to stay with or without the **nishra** of a **sagarik**. **22.** It is not appropriate for **Niggranthis** to stay without the **nishra** of a **sagarik**. **23.** It is appropriate for **Niggranthis** to stay with the **nishra** of a **sagarik**. **24.** It is appropriate for **Niggranthas** to stay with or without the **nishra** of a **sagarik**. **Explanation:** Just as a creeper, without the support of a tree, becomes agitated and unstable due to the wind, in the same way, a **shraman** also becomes agitated and unstable without the **nishra** of a **shayyatar**, i.e., without the responsibility of protection.

[First Objective] [139 A woman may be distressed and fearful, and her chastity can be well protected by the guardianship of a man. Because there is a constant fear of being raped by wicked men. Therefore, even when protected by a female teacher, it is considered necessary for a Shraman to stay under the guardianship of a male. But the virtuous are usually strong, resolute, and fearless in their attitude, and it is not possible for them to be raped in the matter of their celibacy. Therefore, he can stay in the shelter without the guardianship of a male. If there is a thief or a violent animal or any other disturbance, then the virtuous can also stay in the shelter after receiving assurance of protection from a male. The rules for staying in a shelter with householders are as follows: 25. It is not proper for a Niggrantha or a Niggranthi to stay in a Sagarik (householder's residence) shelter. 26. It is not proper for a Niggrantha to stay in a Itthi-Sagarik (only women's residence) shelter. 27. It is proper for a Niggrantha to stay in a Puris-Sagarik (only men's residence) shelter. 28. It is not proper for a Niggranthi to stay in a Puris-Sagarik (only men's residence) shelter. 29. It is proper for a Niggranthi to stay in a Itthi-Sagarik (only women's residence) shelter. _ Discussion-Sagarik shelters are of two types-Dravy-Sagarik and Bhav-Sagarik. A shelter where men and women live or where pictures of men and women are painted on the walls, where wooden, stone, etc. statues of men and women are kept, where there are means of adornment like clothes, ornaments, perfumes, garlands, decorations, etc., where food and drink are kept, where there are songs, dances, plays, etc., or where instruments like veena, flute, mridanga, etc. are played, that shelter is Dravy-Sagarik in one's own place and Bhav-Sagarik in another place.

Page #94:
---------------------------
[140] The meaning of *svasthan* and *parasthan* in the *Vṛhatkalpasūtra* is this: If in that *upaśraya* there are pictures, statues of men, and songs, dances, plays, etc. of men, then it is *dravya-sāgārika* for the *sādhu*s and *bhāva-sāgārika* for the *sādhvī*s. Similarly, if in that *upaśraya* there are pictures, statues, etc. of women, and their songs, dances, plays, etc., then that *upaśraya* is *bhāva-sāgārika* for men and *dravya-sāgārika* for women. *Sādhu*s and *sādhvī*s are not fit to stay in both these types of (*dravya-sāgārika* and *bhāva-sāgārika*) *upaśraya*s. Although the first sūtra clearly prohibits staying in *dravya* and *bhāva-sāgārika* *upaśraya*s, this is the *utsargamārga*. But if while wandering, *sādhu*s and *sādhvī*s do not find a faultless *upaśraya* free from the above defects, then in such a situation, a *sādhu* or *sādhvī* can stay in a *dravya-sāgārika* *upaśraya*. But they cannot stay in a *bhāva-sāgārika* *upaśraya*, as stated in the *sūtra-caturṣka*. In summary, according to the *utsargamārga*, *sādhu*s and *sādhvī*s should not stay in *dravya* and *bhāva-sāgārika* *upaśraya*s, but according to the *apvādamārga*, they can stay in a *dravya-sāgārika* *upaśraya*.

**The rule and prohibition of staying in a *pratibaddha-śayyā***

30. *No kappāi nigganthāṇam paḍibaddha-sejjāe vatthae* / 31. *Kappāi nigganthīṇam paḍibaddha-sejjāe vatthae* / 30. It is not proper for *nirgrantha*s to stay in a *pratibaddha-śayyā* / 31. It is proper for *nirgranthi*s to stay in a *pratibaddha-śayyā*.

**Discussion:**

*Pratibaddha* *upaśraya* is of two types: 1. *dravya-pratibaddha*, 2. *bhāva-pratibaddha*.

1. The *upaśraya* where the roof support, i.e., the roof beams, are connected to the house of a householder, is called a *dravya-pratibaddha* *upaśraya*.

2. *Bhāva-pratibaddha* *upaśraya* is of four types:

1. Where the place for urination, etc. of women and *sādhu*s is the same.
2. Where the place for sitting of women and *sādhu*s is the same.
3. Where the form of a woman is easily visible.
4. Where, upon sitting, words related to women's language, ornaments, and sexual intercourse are heard.

In a *dravya-pratibaddha* *upaśraya*, the sound of *svādhyāya*, etc. can be a hindrance to the householder, and the sound of the householder's activities can be a hindrance to the *sādhu*. There can also be interference in each other's activities. *Bhāva-pratibaddha* *upaśraya* can be a hindrance to the feelings of restraint and celibacy. Therefore, it is not proper to stay in a *dravya-bhāva-pratibaddha-śayyā*.

[First Objective] [141 Although the said faults are common to both Sadhus and Sadhvis, the provision made in the Sutra for Sadhvis is an exception. Because they have to stay in the shelter of the householder, which is not bound. If the unbound shelter is not available, it becomes necessary for them to stay in a bound place. At such a time, they should know from the commentary how to live with wisdom. In special circumstances, a Sadhu may also have to stay in such a place, the method of which is also described in the commentary. According to the Utsarga method, both Sadhus and Sadhvis should stay only in an unbound bed. The method and prohibition of staying in a shelter with a bound path is 32. No Kappi Nigganthanam Gahavaikulass Majjhamshenam Gantu Vatthae / 33. Kappi Nigganthinam Gahavaikulass Masammajhenam Gantu Vatthae / 32. It is not proper for the Nirgranthas to stay in the shelter where the path is through the middle of the house. 33. It is proper for the Nirgranthis to stay in the shelter where the path is through the middle of the house. / Discussion - If there is a shelter in a place where one has to go through the middle of the householder's house and there is no other way, then the Sadhus should not stay in such a shelter, because going through the middle of the householder's house, seeing his wife, sister, etc., hearing words, and seeing many kinds of activities of the householder, the mind of the Sadhus may be disturbed. Or the women living in the house may be disturbed. Nevertheless, the provision in the Sutra for the Sadhvis to stay means that if a faultless unbound shelter is not available, then the Sadhvis can stay in such a shelter. The previous two Sutras have stated the bound place. In the present two Sutras, it has been stated that even though the place is unbound, its path can be bound. It is very important for the Sadhu to avoid such bound places, and it is not so important for the Sadhvi. The main purpose of all these rules and prohibitions in the Sutras is to protect celibacy. The provision for calming oneself 34. Bhikshu Ya Ahigaranam Katu, Tam Ahigaranam Vinosavitt, Viosaviyapahude 1. Icchae Paro Pradhaaejja, Icchae Paro No Pradhaaejja. 2.

A. - (O disciple) Uvasama is the essence of the Shraman life. Although a monk accepts restraint for self-cultivation and constantly engages in practices of restraint such as study, meditation, etc. with unwavering devotion, there are many causes of distraction and passions that remain in the life of a restrained person, such as the body, food, disciples, teachers, clothes, bowls, bedding, etc. The nature, decay, and discernment of each person are also different. The pacification of passions such as anger and pride also varies from person to person. Even though they are renunciants, there is variation in their attachment to possessions and territories (in the absence of attachment). Not everyone achieves equal success in the development of qualities such as humility, simplicity, forgiveness, and peace. Everyone's peace is not equal in disciplining and following discipline. The discernment of language use also varies from person to person. Due to these and other reasons, in the incomplete state of practice, due to distraction and arising, monks may sometimes experience passions or afflictions among themselves.

Page #97:
---------------------------
## First Objective] [143 _ The commentator has explained some of the causes of discord as follows: 1. For the sake of disciples, 2. For the sake of instruments, 3. By uttering harsh words, 4. For the sake of inspiring correction of mistakes, 5. For the sake of mutual restraint-free discussions and debates, 6. For the sake of going or not going to specific established families of faith / Even after discord arises, the restrained Muni's burning passions do not cause a state of unrest for long. He recovers, performs the atonement of criticism, and becomes pure / But the present sutra has presented a specific possibility and provided a solution for it. If a monk, due to intense passions, does not want to calm down voluntarily, then another monk who is calm should think that forgiveness, peace, and calmness are self-dependent, not dependent on others. If, even after taking appropriate measures, the other monk does not calm down and does not bring peace in behavior, then one should not be pacified again by any kind of behavior of that monk. Because by becoming completely calm and free from passions oneself, one can achieve self-worship, and by remaining uncalm, the other monk only faces condemnation, not both. Therefore, it is the Jain injunction for the monk to become completely calm himself. A question has been raised in this regard: If the other monk does not calm down and the said behavior does not become pure, then why is it necessary for the one alone to become calm? In response, it has been explained that calming the passions is the main goal of restraint. Only through this can one attain the state of being free from passions / Remaining calm in every situation is the essence of upholding and following restraint / Therefore, one should consider it absolutely necessary to calm oneself completely for the sake of one's own restraint.

## Discussion - During the rainy season, the land is covered everywhere with green grass, shoots, etc., due to the rain / The earth is filled with small animals living in the grass and earthworms, earthworms, etc., and other small and large creatures, so even with careful wandering, it is possible to harm them / In addition, due to the rain, the rivers and streams on the way are flowing with water, so it may be difficult for the monks and nuns to cross them. During the wandering period, there is also a possibility of their clothes and other belongings getting wet due to the rain, which can lead to harm to the body.

Page #98:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**[144]** The **Brihatkalpa Sutra** clearly states that during the rainy season, for four months, ascetics should stay in one place. This is the first rule. The second rule states that after the **Chaturmas**, they should wander for a month. Wandering helps in the advancement of self-control, spreading the Dharma, achieving **Brahmacharya Samadhi**, improving health, and following the **Jina's** commands. It is forbidden to stay in the same place where **Chaturmas** or **Masakalp** was spent, even if one is healthy, or to stay there for twice the time without wandering elsewhere. There is also a **Prayaschitta** (penance) for this. Therefore, it is necessary to wander according to one's strength during the summer and winter seasons.

**[37]** It is not appropriate for **Nirgranthas** and **Nirgranthis** to travel quickly to and from a **Vairaajya** (hostile kingdom) or a **Viruddha Rajya** (enemy kingdom). Any **Nirgrantha** or **Nirgranthi** who travels quickly to and from a **Vairaajya** or **Viruddha Rajya**, or approves of those who do so, is guilty of violating the commands of both the **Tirthankara** and the king, and is liable for the **Anudghatik Chaturmasik Prayaschitta** (penance).

The **Vivechananiyuktikara** and the **Tikaakara** have given various interpretations of the term "**Rajya**":

1. A kingdom where there is a long-standing feud between the people.
2. Two kingdoms where a feud has arisen.
3. A kingdom whose king and people are involved in burning villages and towns of another kingdom.
4. A kingdom where the ministers, generals, and other important people are discontented with the king and are plotting to overthrow him.
5. A kingdom without a king, where the king has died or been removed. This is called a **Vairaajya**.

**Viruddha Rajya** refers to kingdoms where travel between them is prohibited.

Page #99:
---------------------------
[First Objective] [145] This text prohibits monks and nuns from traveling to and from hostile kingdoms, as frequent travel in such kingdoms may lead to officials perceiving them as thieves, spies, or conspirators, resulting in various forms of suffering like death or imprisonment. Therefore, a monk who travels to and from such "hostile kingdoms" not only violates the king's authority but also disregards the wisdom of the Jinas. Consequently, they become liable for the "Chaturmasik Anudghatik" atonement.

The "Niyuktikara Sutra" explains the terms "Gaman," "Pagaman," and "Gamana-gaman" by stating that if travel to such "hostile kingdoms" is necessary for specific reasons, one should first seek permission from the border guard ("Parakshak"). They should inform the guard about their purpose and request permission to enter the kingdom. If the guard denies permission, they should send a message to the city's chief merchant ("Nagar-Seth") seeking permission. If the merchant also denies permission, they should send a message to the commander-in-chief ("Senapati"). If the commander-in-chief denies permission, they should send a message to the minister. Finally, if the minister denies permission, they should send a message to the king, stating their reason for entering the kingdom and requesting permission. They should also request the king to instruct the border guards to allow their entry. The same procedure should be followed when leaving the kingdom.

The "Niyuktikara" has outlined specific reasons for travel to and from hostile kingdoms:

1. To initiate parents who are ready to take "Diksha" (renunciation).
2. To console those who are grieving.
3. For a monk who desires "Bhaktapan Pratyakhyan" (death by meditation) to seek guidance from their guru or "Geetarth."
4. For the treatment of a sick monk.
5. To pacify a monk who is angry.
6. To engage in scriptural debate ("Shastrarth") when invited by disputants.
7. To rescue an abducted "Pracharaya" (teacher).

In addition to these reasons, monks can travel to and from hostile kingdoms after obtaining permission if other similar circumstances arise.

The term "Sajj" in the sutra, which prohibits frequent travel, implies that repeated requests for permission may irritate or raise suspicion in the king or his officials. While occasional travel for essential purposes may be acceptable, frequent travel can be problematic. If multiple tasks need to be accomplished, one should carefully plan and complete them in a single trip. Ideally, it is best to avoid traveling to such kingdoms or their capitals altogether. This is the path of "Utsargamarga" (renunciation). If travel is unavoidable, it should not be frequent. This is the essence of the sutra.

##  [First Objective]

**[147 "Your clothes, utensils, etc. will be returned to you," by saying this, accepting something with the intention of returning it is called "Saakaraakrut" acceptance.** If the monk accepts it without saying "Saakaraakrut" and uses it, even if given by the householder, he is a participant in theft and is liable for atonement. The reason for this is that when going for Gochari, permission is only given for taking food, therefore, it is necessary to take separate permission explicitly for clothes, etc. The monk can only accept the items for which he has taken permission. He can take other items only with the prior permission of the Acharya, etc., if the householder asks him to take them or if the need is known. If he has taken permission for clothes, etc., then it is not necessary to take them "Saakaraakrut".

**The Sutra-pathit "Uvanimantejja" word is interpreted as "Up-samepe maagaty nimantrayet"** - meaning, the giver should say to the monk who has come for alms, "Please accept this cloth or utensil." Then the monk should ask him (especially the mistress of the house) - "Whose is this cloth, etc., and what is it like, i.e., where and why was it brought?" After getting a satisfactory answer to these two questions, he should ask a third question - "Why is it being given to me?" If the answer is, "You have very old clothes on your body, or your utensils look broken, therefore, it is being given to you out of a sense of duty or religious feeling," then he should take it "Saakaraakrut" (with the intention of returning it). If a satisfactory answer is not received, then he should not take it.

**The appointed person has explained the intention of asking these three things:** the first two questions reveal the nature of the object, and the third question reveals the giver's intentions. If the monk accepts the given cloth, etc., without asking, and the head of the household, brother-in-law, or other maidservant, etc., silently watches the giving and taking, then he may have many suspicions about the giver and the receiver, such as - "There seems to be some mutual attraction between this woman of our house and the monk, or she has no children, therefore, she wants some mantra, tantra, or medicine from the monk for the purpose of procreation."  Overwhelmed by such various suspicions, he may slander, beat, etc., the woman, the monk, or both. If no one in the house has seen or heard anything like this, and the woman who gave the item wants some knowledge, mantra, etc., from the monk because she is childless, etc., then after taking the given item, she may go to the Upashraya and ask - "Tell me the remedy for the success of such and such work." Or, if the woman is a "proshita-bhartrika" (a woman whose husband is away) or lustful, or wants to fulfill her impure desires by going to the Upashraya, she may also say so. If she says so, the monk should answer regarding the mantra, etc., - "It is not our practice to use "nimitta" (mantra, etc.) for householders."

Page #102:
---------------------------
[140] If a woman expresses her desire for something, and the monk, to avoid the faults of accepting gifts from her, says, "We are restrained, we do not want to destroy our restraint by accepting such offerings," she may become angry and speak ill of the monk, demand the return of the gift, or cause other disturbances. For these reasons, it is proper for the monk to ask the three questions, to ascertain the complete purity of the offered clothes, utensils, etc., and to know the true intentions of the giver before accepting the gift. Otherwise, it is not proper. The same procedure should be followed by the nun, but here it is important to note that the attendant keeps the clothes, etc., brought by the nun for seven days and examines them carefully to see if they are "enchanted" with any Vidya, Sammohana-Churna, Mantra, etc. If she finds them innocent, she gives them to the nun who brought them, or if she does not need them, to another nun. She also sees that the giver is not a young man, a widower, an adulterer, or a wicked person, and that the recipient is not a young woman or a newly initiated nun. If any of these reasons are found, the attendant returns the gift. If there is no such reason, she gives it to another nun. The reason for this examination is given by the author of the text as follows: "Women are naturally impatient and easily tempted by others." Although the text states that a nun may accept "Sakarakruta" clothes, etc., from a lay person, the commentator explains that the proper way is for the nun not to accept clothes, etc., from any householder herself. Whenever she needs clothes, etc., she should ask her attendant or the Ganadhara or the Acharya. The Acharya should bring the clothes from the householder's house and keep them for seven days. Then, after washing them, he should give them to a monk to wear. If, after this examination, they are found to be innocent, the attendant should take them and give them to the nun who needs them. If, by chance, the Ganadhara or Acharya is not nearby, the attendant should bring the clothes from the householder's house and examine them according to the above method and give them to the nun. If, by chance, while going to the Gochari, Vicharbhumi, or Viharbhumi, a householder invites her to take clothes, and the nun needs them, she should take the "Sakarakruta" clothes and bring them to the attendant, who should examine them and give them to the nun. This procedure should be understood in relation to an unfamiliar or slightly familiar donor. In the case of a well-known and trusted lay man or woman, the procedure mentioned in the text is sufficient. It should be understood that the procedure mentioned by the commentator is not necessary for them. 42. It is not proper for a monk or a nun, a king or a minister, to accept food, drink, or anything else that has been touched by a person who is not a Jain. 43. It is not proper for a monk or a nun, a king or a minister, to accept clothes, a blanket, or a towel that has been touched by a person who is not a Jain.

It is not permissible for Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis to take Prasna, Pan, Khadim and Swadim at night or during Vikal. Only a pre-written Shayyasanstarak is exempted. / 43. It is not permissible for Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis to take Vastra, Patra, Kambal or Padapronchan at night or during Vikal. / Only a 'Hritahritika' is exempted. / Even if it is Paribhukt, Dhaut, Rakta, Ghrist, Mrishta or Sampradhumit, it is permissible to take it at night. Discussion - Some Acharyas interpret 'Ratri' as Sandhyakal and some Acharyas interpret 'Vikal' as Sandhyakal. The commentator has said that both meanings are appropriate according to Niruktikar. Therefore, except for the pre-written Shayyasanstarak, it is not permissible to take Bhakt-Pan at night or during Sandhya. Although 'Ratribhojan' is not prohibited in the 42 Doshas, there is a clear provision for the sixth Vrat called 'Raibhoyanaveraman' in the Chhajjivikanaya study of the Dashavakalik Sutra. Therefore, it is not permissible for a Sadhu to take any kind of Bhakt-Pan at night. / In addition, even during the day, it is not permissible for a Sadhu to eat food in a place where there is darkness. How can it be permissible for him to eat in the darkness of night? Never. Doubt - The sixth Ratri-Bhakt Vrat prohibits eating and drinking at night, but is there any fault in bringing Bhaktpan at night? _Solution - When travelling for Gochari at night, there is a violation of the Shatkayik Jivas, violation of their Sanjam, and violation of their Atma. In addition, there are many possible faults in travelling for Gochari at night, such as being caught by a thief, going to a householder's house and facing various fears, etc. Therefore, Bhakt-Pan should not be brought at night. / Dashav. A. 6 mentions the faults of eating at night and Nishit U. 10 mentions their Prayaschitta. Doubt - If it is completely prohibited to take Prasnadi at night, why is there a provision in the Sutra to exempt the pre-written Shayyasanstarak? Solution - The Utsargamarga is that no substance should be taken at night. But this Sutra is an example of the Apvadamarga. / Its meaning is that due to reasons like losing the way or the way being too long, a Sthavirakalpi Bhikshu may reach a suitable place after sunset.

[150] When the [Brihatkalpa Sutra] states that they should stay, then due to reasons like housing and livelihood, it becomes necessary for them to accept food, bedding, etc. at night and during the day. Even if they find housing before sunset, if it is possible to obtain necessary bedding, etc. from a householder's shop even after one or two hours at night, then it can also be accepted at night. This rule should be understood in light of such circumstances. Another Sutra prohibits accepting clothes, etc. at night, but if someone like a thief steals the clothes, etc. of a monk or nun while they are traveling from village to village, or steals them from their shelter, and after some time, the thief realizes that they should not have stolen or taken the clothes, etc. of the monk or nun, and then returns them in the evening or at night, or places them in a visible location for the monk to see, then accepting such clothes, etc. is called "Hritahritika". The item that was taken and then returned is called "Hritahritika". The Sutra explains the nature of such "Hritahritika" clothes, etc. using terms like "Paribhukta", etc., which have the following meanings: Paribhukta - if the person who took the clothes, etc. has used them for wearing, etc. Dhouta - if they have been washed with water. Rakta - if they have been dyed in any of the five colors. Ghrista - if the special marks on the clothes, etc. have been rubbed off. Mrishta - if the coarse or rough clothes, etc. have been made soft by using a special substance. Samprdhumita - if they have been perfumed with fragrant incense, etc. If the person who took the clothes, etc. brings them back at night, even if they are of any of the above types, then the monk or nun can accept them. Apart from their own stolen clothes, etc., if someone brings a new garment, a vessel, a foot-cloth, etc. in the evening or at night, then it is not appropriate for the monk or nun to accept it. The Sutra has the reading "Hariyahadiae", which the commentator has interpreted in two ways as "Hariuun ya Prahadia, Chhudha Hariyesu vaa'aahatu". According to the first meaning, the person should come and give it themselves, and according to the second meaning, if they leave it on a "Haritakaya" (tree, bush, etc.) and the person whose clothes, etc. it is, sees it in the light of the moon, etc., then the monk or nun can go and get it in the evening or at night. Or, if another man picks it up and gives it, thinking that it belongs to a particular monk or nun, then the person whose clothes, etc. it is, can accept it. The word "Hritahritika" is feminine, hence the reading in the Sutra is "Sa vi ya Paribhutta", etc., which is feminine. This means "the stolen item".

## First Objective] [Prohibition of Travel at Night 151]

44. It is not permissible for a Niggantha or a Nigganthi, a male or a female, to travel at night or during the twilight hours. 

45. It is not permissible for a Niggantha or a Nigganthi, a male or a female, to go to a Sankaḍī or a Sankaḍī-place for a Sankaḍī at night or during the twilight hours.

**Discussion:**

The first sutra completely prohibits the Nigganthas and Nigganthis from traveling at night or during twilight hours. This is because during these times, those who are traveling are not visible, making it impossible to follow the rules of *īryāsamiti*. Failure to follow *īryāsamiti* violates the principles of restraint. Furthermore, the *Uttarādhyayana* 26 states that the time for *īryāsamiti* is only during the day, not at night. Therefore, traveling at night also violates this rule.

Additionally, traveling at night increases the risk of injury from thorns, stumbling, or falling into ditches. There is also a risk of being bitten by snakes or attacked by lions, tigers, or other predators. Therefore, traveling at night is completely prohibited.

The second sutra prohibits going to a Sankaḍī. A Sankaḍī is a feast or a special gathering that can last for one day or many days. On the main day of the Sankaḍī, invitations are sent out to all the villagers in the surrounding area. A monk who is staying in that area will not be able to receive alms on that day. In such a situation, a monk can go to a *gocari* (a place where alms are received) before the crowd arrives from the Sankaḍī within a radius of two *kośas* (approximately 4 miles). The *Ācārāṅga Śruta* 2, *aṅga* 1, *uddeśaka* 2 prohibits going to a Sankaḍī beyond two *kośas* and also prohibits going to and staying at Sankaḍīs even if invited.

Therefore, the present sutra prohibits a monk from leaving his place before sunrise with the intention of going to a Sankaḍī within two *kośas* to receive alms after sunrise. If it is necessary to go to a Sankaḍī, the monk can go there during the day with discretion.

The use of the word "twilight" along with "night" in the sutra indicates that the monk should not travel or go to a Sankaḍī during the twilight hours before sunrise or after sunset.

**Prohibition of Traveling Alone at Night to a *Sthaṇḍila* or a Place of Study**

46. It is not permissible for a Niggantha to go out or enter a *sthaṇḍila* or a place of study alone at night or during the twilight hours.

Page #106:
---------------------------
[152] It is not permissible for a single *Niggranthi* to go out of the *upaśraya* to the *viyāra-bhūmi* or *vihāra-bhūmi* at night or in the twilight. 47. It is not permissible for a single *Niggranthi* to go out of the *upaśraya* to the *viyāra-bhūmi* or *vihāra-bhūmi* at night or in the twilight. It is permissible for one, two, or three *Niggranthi*s to go out of the *upaśraya* to the *viyāra-bhūmi* or *vihāra-bhūmi* at night or in the twilight. 46. It is permissible for one or two *Niggranthi*s to go out of the *upaśraya* to the *viyāra-bhūmi* or *vihāra-bhūmi* at night or in the twilight.

Page #107:
---------------------------
[Direct Objective] [The possibility of 153 faults is usually not there / because there is constant coming and going of other monks and any sound can be heard. If the number of monks is large and the house is small or there is some reason for non-study in the shelter, then for night study, going elsewhere is done, otherwise, due to the absence of time for walking at night, going out is prohibited. While requesting the shelter, one should definitely keep in mind that it is complete with the land for excreting feces and urine, this is the rule in Aacha. Shra. 2, A. 2, U. 2. and in Dashav. A. 8, Ga. 52. Feces, urine, etc., natural urges of the body cannot be stopped, therefore, even at night, a monk has to go out / The commentator has said that if the monk is not going to be afraid and the possibility of the above faults is not there, then after informing the fellow monks, he can go alone with caution. If there are two monks and one is sick or there are three monks, one is sick and one needs to sit in his service, then he can go alone with caution after informing. Due to many reasons or due to holding Abhigraha, Padima, etc., even those who wander alone sometimes have to go out at night, then they can go with caution. But according to the sutra, one should go with one or two monks with the method of excretion / The reason for taking more than one monk is that there are some very frightening places. A nun is prohibited from going alone anywhere, even during the day, like to Gochari, etc. Therefore, it is more important to keep this in mind at night. The reason for two or more nuns going, i.e., three or four going, should only be understood as a frightening situation or a nature of being afraid. The rest of the discussion should be understood as similar to the discussion related to the monk. But it is not appropriate for nuns to go alone even in any kind of exception, therefore, if there is any special situation, it is better to take a Shravaka or Shravaka along. In any other special situation, the monk-nun can excrete in the utterance-measure and can also eat in the morning and can take appropriate atonement. The rule of wandering in the Aryan field is 48. Kappi Nigganthaan Wa Niggathiin Wa-Purasthimeenam Jaav Angamagahao Ettae, Dakkhineenam Jaav Kosambino Ettae, Pacchaththimeenam Jaav Thunaavisaaao Ettae, Uttreenam Jaav Kunalaavisaaao Ettae. Eyaavayaav Kappi, Eyaavayaav Pariye Khette / No Se Kappi Eto Bahi, Ten Paran Jaty Naan-Dasan-Charittaai Ussappanti / Tti Bemi. 48. It is permissible for the Nirgranthas and the Nirgranthis to go east to Anga-Magadha, south to Kosambi, west to Sthuna country and north to Kunala country / This much is the Aryan field. It is not permissible to go outside this. Thereafter, wander where there is an increase in knowledge, vision and character /

Page #108:
---------------------------
[154] The *Brihatkalpa Sutra* commentary, in the first verse of the *Prajnapana Sutra* on the twenty-five *Aryadesha* of this *Bharat Kshetra*, mentions their names as follows: 1. Magadha, 2. Anga, 3. Bang, 4. Kalinga, 5. Kashi, 6. Kaushala, 7. Kuru, 8. Saurya, 9. Panchala, 10. Jangala, 11. Saurashtra, 12. Videha, 13. Vatsa, 14. Sandibba, 15. Malaya, 16. Vachcha, 17. Acchha, 18. Dasharna, 19. Chedi, 20. Sindhu-Sauvira, 21. Surasena, 22. Bhrigu, 23. Kunala, 24. Kotivarsha, 25. Ladha and Kekaya.

The *Prakrut Sutra* defines their boundaries as follows: In the east, from Angadesha (whose capital was Champa) to Magadhadesha (whose capital was Rajagriha). In the south, to Vatsadesha (whose capital was Kosambi). In the west, to Sthuna desha. In the north, to Kunala desha (whose capital was Sravasti). This is the prescribed area for *sadhu-sadhvi* to travel.

The reason for this is that within these four boundaries, the glories of the *Tirthankaras* are manifested, including their birth, liberation, etc. It is here that the *Sarvajña-Sarvadarshi* *Tirthankaras* and other great beings, who generate knowledge and vision, preach the Dharma. It is here that the *bhavya jiva* attain enlightenment and it is here that they dispel their doubts by listening to the Dharma from the *Jinavaras*. Additionally, *sadhu-sadhvi* receive *bhakti-paan* and *upadhi* easily here, and the *shravaka* people or others here are knowledgeable about the conduct and thoughts of the *sadhu-sadhvi*. Therefore, they should only travel within these *Aryakshetra*.

The *Sutra* clearly states: "This is the *Arya Kshetra* and this is the prescribed area for travel. It is not permissible to travel outside of this." This means that this is the eternal *Aryakshetra*.

Perhaps, due to the good influence of a king or someone else, the people of a non-*Aryakshetra* may become *Arya* in nature, but this change would be temporary. Similarly, in an *Aryakshetra*, there may be a temporary change where the people become non-*Arya* in nature. This is why the final section states: "Even though there are boundaries of the *Kshetra* and boundaries of the *Kalpa*, one should travel wherever the development of *samyama* qualities occurs." Because sometimes, in a non-*Aryakshetra*, one's *samyama* qualities may increase and the *Jinasasana* may be influenced, and sometimes, in an *Aryakshetra*, one's *samyama* qualities may decrease. Therefore, the *Sutra* mentions the boundaries of the *Kshetra* and specifically prescribes travel with the goal of increasing *samyama*.

The *Bhashya* and *Tika* explain that currently, due to the influence and efforts of kings, *sadhu-sadhvi* have started traveling in non-*Aryakshetra* as well. In *Aryakshetra* too, where there are long routes, dense forests, which take many days to cross, traveling in those areas is prohibited in *Acha. Shru. 2, A. 3* and the faults of traveling in those areas are also explained. Therefore, *sadhu-sadhvi* should not go to such divisions of the *Aryakshetra*.

Page #109:
---------------------------
[First Uddeshak] 155 This Sutra and the Pracharang Sutra conclude that while keeping the main goal of Samyomonnaati in mind and considering one's own capacity, one can wander in any area, but generally, one should understand that wandering outside the Aryakshetra is prohibited. The Sutra mentions the names of countries on the borders of the Aryakshetra in all four directions, but instead of mentioning the Kachchh country in the south, it mentions the famous city of 'Kosambi' there. The name of the Thuna country and its main city are not included in the above twenty-five Aryakshetras, the reason for this is the multiplicity or difference in names. The essence of the first Uddeshak is that all the edible parts of a plant, from its root to its seed, can be consumed if they are achitt, but a Sadhvi cannot consume large pieces of kanda, root, fruit, etc., even if they are achitt. It is Kalpata to stay in a village, town, etc., for one month. If there are suburbs, etc., one can stay there for many months, but one should wander for alms only where one stays, not in other suburbs. 10-11 A Sadhu-Sadhvi should not stay in a Pramaadi with one Parikshep and one path for coming and going, but if it has many paths or doors, they can stay there even for one Kal. 12-13 Sadhvis should not stay in shelters built in tri-junctions, four-junctions, or markets, etc., where there is a lot of movement of men, but Sadhus can stay in those shelters. 14-15 Sadhvis should not stay in a place without a door, if they have to stay due to circumstances, they should close the door by putting up a curtain. But Bhikshus can stay in such places. 16-17 A Sadhvi can keep a Prasravana-matraka in the shape of a surahi, but a Sadhu cannot. It is Kalpata for a Sadhu-Sadhvi to keep a cloth chilmilika (mosquito net). Sadhu-Sadhvi should not sit by the water, etc. 20-21 One should not stay in a house with paintings. Sadhvis should stay only under the protection of Shayyatar, but Bhikshus can stay without protection. 22-24

## Second Objective: Rules and Prohibitions for Staying in a Granary

**1.**  It is not permissible for Nirgranthas or Nirgranthis to stay in a granary where the following grains are scattered, spread out, scattered in heaps, or scattered widely: 1. Rice, 2. Wheat, 3. Green gram, 4. Black gram, 5. Sesame, 6. Horse gram, 7. Wheat, 8. Barley, 9. Jowar, even for a short period of time.

**2.** However, if it is known that the grains (from rice to jowar) are not scattered, spread out, scattered in heaps, or scattered widely, but are stored in heaps, in bundles, against the wall, in baskets, marked, stamped, or hidden, then it is permissible for Nirgranthas or Nirgranthis to stay there during the winter and summer seasons.

**3.** However, if it is known that the grains (from rice to jowar) are not stored in heaps, in bundles, against the wall, or in baskets, but are stored in a granary, in a loft, on a platform, or in a garland, plastered with mud or dung, covered, marked, or sealed, then it is permissible for Nirgranthas or Nirgranthis to stay there during the rainy season.

**Discussion:** These sutras describe three situations regarding houses where grains are stored. The first situation is a house where grains are scattered everywhere, which is completely impermissible.

Page #113:
---------------------------
The second objective [159 is / the second condition is that in the house where grain is kept organized, one can stay while wandering in the Hemant or summer season. The third condition is - where the grain is completely organized, one can perform Chaturmas / The explanation of 'Yathalankal' used in the first sutra is as follows - Gaha-Tivihan Cha Prahalandan, Jahannam Majjhim Cha Ukkosan / Udaullam Cha Jahannam, Panagam Pun Hoi Ukkosan // - Briha. Bhashya 3303 Yathalanda is a special time. It is of three types 1. Jghanya, 2. Madhyama, 3. Utkrishta / The time it takes for the line of a wet hand to dry is called Jghanya Yathalankal. Five days and nights are called Utkrishta Yathalankal. In Brihatkalpa Sutra Udde. 3 and in Uvvaisutr, 29 days have been taken from it and the time between these two is called Madhyama Yathalankal. In the shelter where any grain is scattered in the aforementioned manner, even Jghanya Yathalankal is not considered appropriate. Because going and coming from above them causes violation of seeds with consciousness and walking on grains can also cause self-violation by slipping and falling, therefore, sadhus and sadhvis should not stay there even for a moment. If, perhaps, another shelter is not found even after trying, then one can stay there with effort after cleaning it with rajoharan etc. Then one should accept the appropriate atonement for it. The word 'Antovagadae' has been used here for the part of the house where the sadhu has to stay or move around. In the second sutra, the grains like Sali, Vrihi etc. are not scattered in the house, but their circular mass is formed, long mass is formed, they are kept against the wall, they are kept in round or square vessels made of Kulik-earth, they are collected and marked with ash (ash) etc., they are imprinted with dung etc., they are covered with bamboo mats, baskets or plates, clothes etc., then in winter and summer, according to their own kalpa, sadhus and sadhvis should stay in such a house, but it is not appropriate to stay in such a house during the rainy season / The grains like Sali, Vrihi etc. mentioned in the third sutra are not kept in the form of a mass within the boundary of the house or against the wall etc., but they are kept well protected inside a room or a kothi / Such as - Palya-gupta-wood, Vansh-dal etc. made and plastered with dung-earth etc. round

Page #114:
---------------------------
## Translation:

**160] The special vessel used to store grains, made according to the Brihatkalpa Sutra, is called a 'paly'. The grains stored safely inside such a 'paly' are called 'palyagupt'. 'Manchagupt' refers to grains stored in a circular platform made of bamboo slats, built on three or four pillars, plastered with cow dung and mud on all sides. 'Malagupt' refers to grains stored in a house, where the doors of the upper floor are securely closed. If grains are stored in these places and covered with mud, plastered with cow dung, covered, marked, and sealed, so that the grains cannot come out on their own and cannot be taken out during the rainy season, then monks or nuns can stay in such a house during the rainy season. However, the commentators say that this rule of staying in such houses applies only to 'geetarth' monks and nuns, not to 'ageetarth' monks and nuns, and only if no other place is available. It should be understood that 'ageetarth' monks can stay under the guidance of 'geetarth' monks.

**4. Prohibition and atonement for staying in a house with liquor:**

If there are pots filled with liquor or 'sauvir' liquor inside the shelter, then it is not permissible for 'nirgranth' monks and nuns to stay there even for a short time. If, upon investigation, no other shelter is found, then it is permissible to stay in the said shelter for one or two nights, but it is not permissible to stay for more than one or two nights. Whoever stays there for more than one or two nights is liable to 'diksha-ched' or 'tap' atonement for violating the rules.

**Explanation:**

The liquor made from rice, etc., is called 'sura', and the liquor made from grapes, dates, etc., is called 'sauvir liquor'. Monks and nuns should not stay in a place where these two types of liquor are kept in pots, even for a short time. If they do, they are liable to 'laghuchaumasi' atonement. This is because staying in such a place may lead to a monk consuming liquor, which can lead to many faults, and it can also raise doubts in the minds of ordinary people.

Page #115:
---------------------------
## Second Objective] [161 Aayachitt 

If another place is not available, one can rest there for one night. If it is more necessary, one can rest for two nights as well. This is a special provision for the Gītartha or for the Agītartha under the leadership of the Gītartha. Staying for more than two nights violates the prescribed limit and incurs a penance of Tapp or Chhed. The commentary on the sutra "Se Santara Chheee Wa Parihare Wa" is as follows: "Se-Tasy Sanayatasy, 'Swantaraat' Swaswakritam Yadantaram-Triraatra-Chatuhraatraadi Kalam Pravasthanaroopam, Tasmaat, 'Chhedo Wa'-Panch Raatri Vivaadih, 'Pariharo Wa'-Masalghukaaditipovishesho Bhavati Iti Sutraarthah. The meaning of this commentary is that the restrained person, due to his own fault of staying for three, four, or more days, incurs a penance of Tapp or Chhed as appropriate. However, it is not appropriate to interpret the word "Se Santara" as meaning that the penance should be for the same number of days as the stay. Because the commentator has not interpreted it that way anywhere. Therefore, the meaning accepted by the commentator should be followed.

## The Law, Prohibition, and Penance of Staying in a Water-Filled Upaashraya 5. 

If there are pots filled with cold water or hot water inside the Upaashraya, then it is not permissible for the Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis to stay there even for "Yathalanda-kaal". If, upon investigation, no other Upaashraya is found, then it is permissible to stay in the said Upaashraya for one or two nights. However, it is not permissible to stay for more than one or two nights. Whoever stays there for more than one or two nights becomes liable for the penance of Diksha-Chhed or Tapp due to violation of the prescribed limit. 

## Discussion

A pot filled with cold water whose color, etc., has changed due to boiling on fire or due to substances like alkali, etc., is called "Sheetodakavikritakumbha". Similarly, a pot filled with hot water whose color, etc., has changed due to boiling on fire or due to substances like alkali, etc., is called "Ushnodakavikritakumbha". In an Upaashraya where such pots (of either or both types) are kept, the Sadhus and Sadhvis should not stay there even for "Yathalanda-kaal". 

## Special Discussion

It should be understood according to the previous sutra.

Page #116:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

[162] The present Sutra in the Bahutkalpa Sutra does not mention *saccitta* water, but *acitta* water. This means that a Sadhu can easily use *acitta* water. It is not easily possible for a Sadhu to drink *saccitta* water. / If a Bhikshu gets thirsty at night while staying in a place with *acitta* water, and drinks that water, then his *ratribhojanaviraman* is broken. Therefore, it is forbidden to stay in such places of doubt. The Sutra uses the word 'Viyad' along with cold and hot water, which is used in other Agamas with different meanings and as an adjective. For detailed information on this topic, see Nishita U. 19 Sutra 1-7.

**Rules and prohibitions for staying in an Upashraya with fire or lamp, and the atonement:**

6. If fire burns all night inside the Upashraya, then neither the Nirgranthas nor the Nirgranthis are allowed to stay there even for *yathalankadkal*. If, after searching, no other Upashraya is found, then it is permissible to stay in the said Upashraya for one or two nights, but not more than that. / Whoever stays there for more than one or two nights is liable for *diksha-ched* or *tap* atonement due to transgression of the rules.

7. If a lamp burns all night inside the Upashraya, then neither the Nirgranthas nor the Nirgranthis are allowed to stay there even for *yathalankadkal*. If, after searching, no other Upashraya is found, then it is permissible to stay in the said Upashraya for one or two nights, but not more than that. / Whoever stays there for more than one or two nights is liable for *diksha-ched* or *tap* atonement due to transgression of the rules.

---------------------------
## Second Objective] [163 Whoever stays there for more than one or two nights is eligible for Diksha-Chhed or Tap-Roop Prāyaścitta due to Marmaada Ullanghan. Discussion- It is not appropriate for a monk to stay in a house where fire burns all night or day and night (like a potter's workshop or a blacksmith's workshop etc.). If there is no fire in the place of stay and on the path of coming and going, but it burns somewhere else, then it is appropriate to stay there / Similarly, the place where a lamp burns all night or day and night is also inappropriate. The faults of staying in a place with fire or lamp are: 1. The killing of Agni-Kaya Jivas while coming and going near the fire or lamp. 2. Any equipment can fall into the fire due to wind and burn. 3. The killing of Tris Jivas coming due to the lamp. 4. The intention of cooling may arise. Aacha. Shru. 2, A. 2, U. 3 also prohibits staying in a place with fire and Nishīth U. 16 has its Prāyaścitta Vidhan. These previous texts do not prohibit short-term fire or lamp, but in the first objective of this Sutra, there is a provision for the Sadhu to stay in a male Sagarik Upashraya and the Sadhvi to stay in a female Sagarik Upashraya. Where there is also a possibility of fire or lamp burning / Therefore, from these Sutras, one should understand the prohibition of places where fire burns all night. Other discussions should be understood in the same way as the previous Sutra / The rules, prohibitions and Prāyaścitta of staying in a house with food items 8. Pind-shaped food, Lochak-Mava etc., milk, curd, Navneet, ghee, oil, Phaniyam, Purva, Sakkuli, Siharini, etc. are placed inside the Upashraya, whether they are scattered, scattered, scattered, or scattered, it is not appropriate for Nigganthas or Nigganthis to stay there for a day. 9. But one should know this - not scattered, not scattered, not scattered, not scattered. Rasikadaani, Punjakadaani, Bhiti-kadaani, Kuliya-kadaani, Lanchhiyani, Muddiyani, Pihiyani are appropriate for Nigganthas or Nigganthis to stay there during Hemant-Grima / 10. But one should know this - not Rasikadaani, not Kuliya-kadaani, Kotta-uttaani, Palla-uttaani, Mancha-uttaani, Mala-uttaani, Kubhi-uttaani, Karabi-uttaani, Olittaani, Vilitaani, Pihiyani, Lanchhiyani, Muddiyani are appropriate for Nigganthas or Nigganthis to stay there during Vasa-Vas. 8.

If it is known that (inside the shelter, food in the form of a lump or sandalwood) is not piled up or made into a small mound, but is stored in a granary or a container, is kept on a platform or a garland, is kept in a pot or a bowl, is smeared with mud or dung, is covered, marked, or sealed, then it is permissible for them to stay there during the rainy season. / The discussion-sutra 1-3 describes a shelter house containing grain, and these three sutras describe a house containing food. / Grain can be scattered on the ground, but these food items are scattered in vessels, etc. / The faults that arise from staying in a shelter containing food are: 1. Insects are more likely to breed in a house containing food. 2. Rats, cats, etc. also roam around. 3. Animals and birds can eat them carelessly. 4. There is a fault of obstruction in preventing and removing them from eating, and if they are not removed, the owner of the house may become angry or may suspect that the sadhu is eating them. 5. Sometimes a hungry or thirsty monk may be tempted to eat, and if he eats, he incurs the fault of adatta. 6. The fragrance or stench of food can lead to many auspicious and inauspicious thoughts, which bind karma. Other discussion sutras should be understood in the same way as 1-3. / The rules and prohibitions for sadhus and sadhvis staying in a dharmshala, etc. 11. It is not permissible for Nirgranthas to stay in a pragamaṇagṛha, a house open on all sides, under a thatched roof, or in a house with a bamboo lattice, under a tree, or under the sky (in open spaces). 12. It is permissible for Nirgranthas to stay in a pragamaṇagṛha, a house open on all sides, under a thatched roof, or in a house with a bamboo lattice, under a tree, or under the sky (in open spaces).

The second objective [165 12. It is appropriate for the Nirgranthas to stay in an Āgamana-gṛha (dharmaśālā), in a house open on all sides, under a canopy or in a house with a bamboo lattice, under a tree or under the sky (in open spaces). Discussion 1. Āgamana-gṛha - A temple, assembly hall, dharmaśālā, inn or traveler's inn, etc., where travelers come and go, is called 'Āgamana-gṛha'. 2. Vivṛta-gṛha - A place that is covered only from above and open on two, three or four sides is called 'Vivṛta-gṛha'. 3. Vaṁśī-mūla - A corridor, verandah, canopy, etc., covered from above with bamboo matting, etc., and open in front, is called Vaṁśī-mūla. Or a place enclosed on all sides with a bamboo lattice is called 'Vaṁśī-mūla'. 4. Vṛkṣa-mūla - The base of a tree is called 'Vṛkṣa-mūla'. 5. Abhra-ākāśa - Open sky or a place whose upper part is mostly open is called 'Abhra-ākāśa'. Sadhvis should not stay in such a place in any season because these are completely unsafe places. Staying in such places increases the possibility of breaking the vow of celibacy. If the time of sunset arrives while traveling and a suitable place is not found, it is very important for the Sadhvi to reach a suitable place after sunset. The reason for the provision made in the sūtra for the Sadhus to stay in such a place is that men naturally have less fear and they do not need a safe place as much for the protection of celibacy. In normal circumstances, a sthavirakalpi bhikṣu should stay only in such places other than the places mentioned in the sūtra; where staying, all the bhikṣus can properly maintain their restraint, study, food, etc. The word 'viyaḍ' is used in the previous sūtra in the sense of 'unconscious' and in the present sūtra it is used in the sense of being open in one or more directions of the house. This is the unique style of word usage in the Āgamas. The method of taking permission for a house with many owners 13. Egaṁ sāgārie pārihārie. Do, tiṇṇi, cattāri, pañca sāgāria pārihāria. Ega tattha kappagaṁ ṭhavaittā avasese nivvisejja / 13. One owner of the house is the pārihārika. In a house with two, three, four or five owners, one is considered the kalpaka = śayyatar

---------------------------
One should not consider the remaining as *Shayatar* (one who provides lodging) just because they have a *Brihatkalpasutra* (a Jain scripture). This means that one can go to their houses to take food and other things. *Vivechanagar* is a synonym for a house. The owner of a house or residence is called a *Sagarik*. A *Sagarik* is also called *Shayatar*, *Shayyakar*, *Shayya-data*, and *Shayyadhar*. A *Shayatar* is one who provides lodging, residence, or shelter to monks and nuns, thereby saving their souls from the ocean of worldly existence. A *Shayyakar* is one who builds lodging, residence, etc. A *Shayya-data* is one who provides lodging to monks. A *Shayyadhar* is one who maintains the lodging, residence, or shelter by providing its roof, walls, etc., or who protects his soul from hell by providing lodging to monks. 

The *Sagarik* who provides lodging to a monk or nun is considered *Pariharic* (one who is to be avoided) according to the scriptures, and therefore, one should not accept food or drink from his house. If there are multiple owners of a place or house, then all of them are *Pariharic*. Therefore, one should establish one of them as *Kalpak* (Shayatar) and obtain knowledge from him, but should not accept food or drink from his house. All the other owners of that place or house who are partners or shareholders should not be considered *Shayatar*, and one can accept food and drink from their houses. 

The commentator of the *Sutras* has interpreted the Prakrit word "Nivvisajja" in two ways: 1. *Nivishyet-Visarjayet-Shayataratvena na ganayet* (one should not consider them as *Shayatar* by entering and discarding them), or 2. *Nivishyet-Pravishet Ahararth Tesham (Seshanam) Griheshv Anuvishyet* (one should enter their houses for the purpose of food). 

In addition, the commentator has explained in detail many things that are worth knowing, such as the types of lodging, who should be considered *Sagarik*, and whether it is permissible to accept food, drink, clothes, utensils, etc., from the *Sagarik's* property. A summary of this is given in *Nishith Uddeshak* 2, Sutra 46. Interested readers can refer to it. 

This Sutra also implies that one can establish one person as *Shayatar* among multiple owners and then, after a few days, establish another person as *Shayatar-Kalpak*. This way, many people can benefit from the donation of lodging and food. 

**Sanskrit Verse:**

*14. No Kappi Nigganthaan Va Niggathiin Va Sagariyapiindam Bahiya Anihadam, Asansarts Va Sansaddham Va Padigahitte.*

**Translation:**

*14. A monk or nun should not accept the property of a *Sagarik* outside the house, whether it is unmixed or mixed, whether it is offered with respect or not.*

Page #121:
---------------------------
## Second Objective:

**14.** It is not permissible for a Niggantha or Nigganthi to accept Sagarikapiṇḍa (bed-related food) from a house where it has not been taken outside, whether it has been mixed with the food of others or not.

**15.** It is not permissible for a Niggantha or Nigganthi to accept Sagarikapiṇḍa from a house where it has been taken outside but not mixed with the food of others.

**16.** It is permissible for a Niggantha or Nigganthi to accept Sagarikapiṇḍa from a house where it has been taken outside and mixed with the food of others.

**17.** It is not permissible for a Niggantha or Nigganthi to mix Sagarikapiṇḍa that has been taken outside the house with the food of others, even if it has not been mixed before.

**18.** A Niggantha or Nigganthi who mixes Sagarikapiṇḍa that has been taken outside the house and not mixed with the food of others, or approves of such an action, transgresses both worldly and transcendental norms and is liable for the four-month atonement of Anudghātika Parihāraṭṭhāna.

**Discussion:**

The previous sūtra dealt with the rules regarding accepting food from a house with multiple owners, including the owner of the bed, and the prohibition of accepting food from the owner of the bed, while allowing acceptance of food from other owners' houses. These sūtras address the rules regarding accepting food from a place where food from multiple individuals is collected, including food from the owner of the bed. They clarify when such food is unacceptable and when it is acceptable.

The first sūtra implies that if the collective food of multiple individuals is within the boundaries of the owner of the bed's house, and the owner's food is either separate or mixed with the others, it is not permissible for a monk to accept it.

The second sūtra implies that if the collective food of multiple individuals is outside the boundaries of the owner of the bed's house, and the owner's food is kept separate, it is not permissible to accept it.

Page #122:
---------------------------
[168] The *Brihatkalpa Sutra* states that if the food offered to a *shayyatar* has been mixed with the food offered to others, and the offerings to the deities for which the food was intended have been removed, and the portion meant for Brahmanas and others has been given, then a monk may accept the remaining food. This is because the food of the *shayyatar* no longer has a separate existence or ownership in the mixed food. Therefore, there is no fault in accepting this mixed and remaining food, as it does not constitute accepting the *shayyatar*’s food. This is the meaning of the third sutra.

It is not permissible for a monk to accept unmixed food offered to a *shayyatar* for any reason, even if it is offered to him by someone else. This is the meaning of the fourth sutra.

Accepting unmixed food offered to a *shayyatar* is against the principles of restraint and decorum, and it is also offensive to people. Therefore, a monk who does so violates both worldly conduct and the principles of restraint and decorum. Hence, he incurs penance. This is the meaning of the fifth sutra.

If a *shayyatar* offers unmixed food to a monk, or if the food is offered within the boundaries of his house, and the *shayyatar* is of a good nature, he may try to offer food again on that occasion. However, if he is of a mean nature, he may become angry and refuse to offer food, or even forbid the monk from entering his house or offering him a bed.

There is no such possibility of fault in accepting mixed food offered outside the boundaries of the *shayyatar*’s house. Therefore, it is considered acceptable.

The rules regarding accepting food offered to a *shayyatar* at his house or sent from his house are as follows:

19. If a *sagarik* has accepted food offered to him at his house, and the *sagarik* offers it to a monk, then the monk should not accept it.

20. If a *sagarik* has not accepted food offered to him at his house, and the person who brought the food offers it to a monk, then the monk may accept it.

21. If food offered to a *sagarik* at his house has been taken to another house and the householder of that house has not accepted it, then the monk should not accept it.

22. If food offered to a *sagarik* at his house has been taken to another house and the householder of that house has accepted it, then the monk may accept it.

Page #123:
---------------------------
## [169 Second Objective]

22. If food brought from another house to the house of a *sagarika* is accepted by the householder, it is permissible for the *sadhu* to accept it. The food brought to the *sagarika's* house from another house is called *prahutika*, and the food brought from the *sagarika's* house to another house is called *nihratika*. These four sutras explain the circumstances under which a *sadhu* can accept *prahutika* and *nihratika* food related to a *sagarika*. This *prahutika* and *nihratika* can be for a festival or celebration. If someone asks the *sadhu* to accept *prahutika* or *nihratika* food, the *sadhu* can accept the *prahutika* of the *sagarika* as long as it is not in the possession of the *sagarika*. The *sadhu* can accept the *nihratika* of the *sagarika* after it has been accepted by someone else. The *sadhu* cannot accept food from the person distributing the *nihratika* of the *sagarika*, but can accept food from the person distributing the *prahutika* of the *sagarika*. The previous sutra states that the *sagarika's* food can be accepted, whether it is separate or mixed with the food of many others, within the boundaries of the *sagarika's* house or elsewhere. These sutras state that the food can be accepted, whether it is in the *sagarika's* house or elsewhere, whether it is the *sagarika's* or someone else's, whether it is given or taken, as long as it is not in the possession of the *sagarika* or has not been accepted by someone else. The *sadhu* cannot accept the food as long as it is in the possession of the *sagarika* or if the *sagarika* has accepted food brought from someone else. It is important to understand the difference between these two scenarios. These sutras are meant to be understood in the context of a *bhiksu* arriving at the place where the *prahutika* and *nihratika* are being distributed, while on a *gochari* journey, and being invited by the distributor or receiver.

## The Law of Accepting Food with a *Sagarika's* Share

23. If the food of a *sagarika* and others is: 1. not divided, 2. not divided, 3. the *sagarika's* share is not separately determined, 4. the share is not separated and taken out, then it is not permissible for the *sadhu* to accept it if someone offers it to them.

24. If the food of a *sagarika* and others is: 1. divided, 2. separated, 3. the *sagarika's* share is separately determined, 4. the share is separated and taken out, then it is permissible for the *sadhu* to accept it.

Page #124:
---------------------------
## 170] [Mahatkalpasutra 24. If the food, etc., containing a share of the Sagarika, is 1. divided, 2. divided, 3. the Sagarika's share is divided, 4. that share is removed, then it is permissible for the Sadhu to accept it from the remaining food. / Discussion - The meaning of the terms used in the Sutra is as follows: 1. A विभक्त-विभक्त means separation or division, until the Sagarika's share is separately determined from the combined food, it is 'A विभक्त'. 2. अव्यवच्छिन्न-व्युच्छिन्न or व्यवच्छिन्न means severance of connection. Until the Sagarika's share is severed, it is 'अव्यवच्छिन्न'. 3. अव्याकृत-व्याकृत means clarification of the share, that this much share is yours and this much share is mine, until such determination is made, it is called 'अव्याकृत'. 4. अनि! ढ नियूंढ means 'to separate from the separately determined share'. / Until the Sagarika's share is removed from the combined food, it is called 'अनि'ढ'. Thus, the collective meaning of the entire Sutra is that when the share of the Sagarika is undivided, unconnected, undetermined, and unremoved from the food of many individuals, including the Shayatar, then if any individual among the organizers of that food gives some share to the Sadhu, it is not acceptable to them. But when the Sagarika's share is divided, severed, determined, and removed, then the food offered from that combined food is acceptable to the Sadhu and he can accept it. It is also mentioned here that in addition to the food prepared jointly by many people, the jointly prepared jaggery, oil, ghee, etc., are all included in this. Even from them, until the Sagarika's share is removed and completely separated, those substances are also unacceptable to the Sadhu. In the previous Sutras, the Sansrusht Asansrusht food does not belong to anyone and is not divided. But the food mentioned in the present Sutra is owned, it is divided and also given to the Shayatar. / This is the difference between the two cases. / The rules for accepting or rejecting the food given to the venerable ones of the Shayatar are as follows: 25. If the food offered to the Sagarika is intended for the Pauddiya, and the Sagarika's share is removed and given to the Pauddiya, and the Sagarika gives it, or the Sagarika's attendant gives it, then it is not permissible to accept it. 26. If the food offered to the Sagarika is intended for the Pauddiya, and the Sagarika's share is removed and given to the Pauddiya, and the Sagarika does not give it, nor does the Sagarika's attendant give it, but the Sagarika's Puja gives it, then it is not permissible to accept it.

## Second Objective] [171 27. If a Sagarika has offered food to her revered guests, and the food was prepared in the Sagarika's utensils and is *pratiharic*, then if the Sagarika or her family members offer it, it is not *kalpata* for the Sadhu to accept. 28. If a Sagarika has offered food to her revered guests, and the food was prepared in the Sagarika's utensils and is *apratiharic*, then if the Sagarika or her family members offer it, it is not *kalpata* for the Sadhu to accept. But if the revered guests offer it, then it is *kalpata* for the Sadhu to accept. / 25. If a Sagarika has offered food to her revered guests, and the food was prepared in the Sagarika's utensils and is *pratiharic*, then if the Sagarika or her family members offer it, it is not *kalpata* for the Sadhu to accept. 26. If a Sagarika has offered food to her revered guests, and the food was prepared in the Sagarika's utensils and is *pratiharic*, then if neither the Sagarika nor her family members offer it, but the revered guests offer it, it is still not *kalpata* for the Sadhu to accept. 27. If a Sagarika has offered food to her revered guests, and the food was prepared in the Sagarika's utensils and is *apratiharic*, then if the Sagarika or her family members offer it, it is not *kalpata* for the Sadhu to accept. 28. If a Sagarika has offered food to her revered guests, and the food was prepared in the Sagarika's utensils and is *apratiharic*, then if neither the Sagarika nor her family members offer it, but the revered guests offer it, then it is *kalpata* for the Sadhu to accept. Discussion - Food prepared for various relatives like father-in-law, maternal uncle, brother-in-law, son-in-law, teacher, art teacher, master or guest, etc. is called *pujya-bhakta*. / If such food is brought from the house of the *shayyatar* and offered to the revered guests staying there, or if it is ordered from the market and sent as a gift to the revered guests, or if it is cooked in the *shayyatar's* utensils (vessels), taken out from their vessels and is *pratiharic*, i.e., if the servant or family member sends it saying that the remaining food after feeding the revered guests should be brought back, then all such food is called *pujya-bhakta*. Similarly, clothes, vessels, blankets, etc. brought or prepared for the revered guests of the Sagarika are called *pujya-utkaran*. Such *pujya-jan-nimitta* food and utensils, whether offered by the *shayyatar* themselves, their family members, or the revered guests, are not *kalpata* for the Sadhu-Sadhvi to accept. / Because the remaining food is to be returned to the *shayyatar*, it remains connected to their ownership.

Page #126:
---------------------------
[172] [Brihatkalpa Sutra] If the food offered to the venerable ones is not to be returned to the lay person after eating, i.e., if the remaining food is not to be returned to the lay person, then such food can be taken. / If the lay person or his family members give that food, then it cannot be taken, but if other venerable ones, etc., give it, then it can be taken. From these sutras, it also follows that food that is not owned by the lay person cannot be taken from the hands of the lay person or his son, grandson, wife, daughter-in-law, etc., but that food can be taken from the hands of married daughters. / For the Nirgrantha-Nirgranthi, the following five types of clothes are considered appropriate: 1. Jangmik, 2. Bhangik, 3. Sanak, 4. Potak, 5. Tiritpattak. / Explanation: 1. Jangmik - Clothes made from the hair of sheep, etc., are called 'Jangmik'. 2. Bhangik - Clothes made from the bark of flax, etc., are called 'Bhangik'. 3. Sanak - Clothes made from jute are called 'Sanak'. 4. Potak - Clothes made from cotton are called 'Potak'. 5. Tiritpattak - Clothes made from the bark of the Tirit (Timir) tree are called 'Tiritpattak'. / These five types of clothes are considered appropriate for the Sadhu. / Even though there is such a sutra-instruction, the commentator has instructed that only three clothes, two cotton and one woolen, should be kept for the Sadhu-Sadhvi. Jangam means Trisajiv. / Asajiv are of two types - Vikalendriya and Panchendriya. / Kosa, silk and velvet are Vikalendriya animal clothes. Their use is completely prohibited for the Sadhu, because they are made from threads obtained by killing those animals. Clothes made from the skin of Panchendriya animals are also prohibited for the Sadhu-Sadhvi. But they can use woolen clothes made from their hair. Because cutting the hair of sheep, etc., does not kill those animals. / Rather, they feel lighter after cutting the wool. These clothes are also considered appropriate in Pracha. Shru. 2, A. 5, U. 1 and Thanang A. 5, U. 3. Acharaang Sutra also states that - 'A monk who is young, healthy and strong should keep clothes of only one type, not of many types. / Other ordinary monks can keep clothes of one or many types.

Page #127:
---------------------------
[Second Objective] [173 From these five types of cloths, whichever is easily available and suitable can be accepted.  /  Priority should be given to cotton and wool, these two. For Nirgrantha-Nirgranthis, the suitable Rajoharan is 30. Kappi Nigganthaan va Nigganthiin va imaim panch rayaharanai dharittae va pariharaittae va, tan jaha-1. Onnie, 2. Uttrie, 3. Saanae, 4. Bacchachippae, 5. Mujchippae naam panchmae. Tti bemi. 30. Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis are eligible to keep and use these five types of Rajoharans / such as 1. Aunik, 2. Praustrik, 3. Sanak, 4. Vacchachippak, 5. Mujchippak / Discussion: That by which dust etc. material-dust and karma-malरूप भाव-रज are removed is called 'Rajoharan'. Dravyarajoharan-While walking, the dust that sticks to the feet or the dust that comes into the house is removed by sweeping, hence it is 'Dravyarajoharan'. Bhavarajoharan-Insects etc. that have climbed on the ground, body or clothes-bed etc. can be removed from Rajoharan without causing them any harm, hence it is 'Bhavarajoharan' as it is a means of protecting life. This Rajoharan is of five types: 1. Aunik-That which is made from the wool of sheep etc. is 'Paunik' / 2. Paustrik -That which is made from the hair of a camel is 'Paustrik'. 3. Shanak- That which is made from the bark of flax is 'Shanak'. 4. Vacchachippak Vaccha means grass or straw, the Rajoharan made by pounding it and removing the rough parts is called 'Vacchachippak' / / 5. Mujchippak-The Rajoharan made by pounding Munja and removing its hard parts is called 'Mujchippak'. In Sthananga A. 5, U. 3, these five types of Rajoharan are also mentioned. Of these five, the earlier ones are softer and the later ones are rougher / Therefore, being the softest, Aunik Rajoharan is considered the most suitable or best. In its absence, the commentator has clearly instructed the use of Austrik and in its absence, Shanak Rajoharan. If all three types of Rajoharans are not available in a particular country, then in such a situation, it is the rule to accept Vacchachippak and in its absence, Mujchippak Rajoharan.

---------------------------
[Brihatkalpasutra] The text prescribes a laghumasika (minor monthly) prayashchitta (atonement) for the improper acquisition of rajoharana (menstrual cloth). Maintaining the samyama (restraint) of the sadhus and sadhvis, and for the removal of physical rajas (impurities), it is necessary to possess a rajoharana.

The summary of the other topics is as follows:
1-3) One should not stay in a house where grains are scattered, but if they are properly stacked, one can stay there for a masakalpa (monthly period) or even the entire chaturmas (four-month period) if the house is sealed.
4-7) One should not stay in a house where vessels containing liquor, cold or hot water are present, or where a fire or lamp is burning throughout the night. However, in the absence of any other place, one can stay there for one or two nights.
8-10) One should not stay in a house where food items are scattered here and there, but if they are properly stacked in one corner, one can stay there for a masakalpa or the entire chaturmas if the house is sealed.
11-12) Sadhvis should not stay in dharmashalas (rest houses) or unsafe places, but in the absence of any other place, sadhus can stay there.
14-16) If a bed has multiple owners, one should take the permission of one owner and consider it as one's own. One should not take food from the houses of other owners.
17-18) If the food of the bed-owner and others is stored in the same place, one should not take from the portion set aside for the bed-owner, but can take from the portion set aside for others.
19-22) The sadhus and sadhvis should not mix the food set aside for the bed-owner with the food of others. If they do so, they incur a chaturmasika (four-month) prayashchitta.
23-24) One can take from the food items that belong to the bed-owner only when the portion belonging to the bed-owner is completely separated. If it is not completely separated, one should not take from it.

[Second Objective] [175 Sutra 25-28] It is permissible to accept food from the **Shayyaa-daataa** (one who provides lodging) which is entirely dedicated to **pujya purushas** (venerable men), but it is not permissible to accept food that is given as **praatihaar** (a gift in return). It is also not permissible to accept such food from the hands of the **Shayyaa-daataa** or their family members. **Sadhus** (male ascetics) and **Sadhvis** (female ascetics) can accept any type of **vastra** (clothing) or **rajo-haran** (toiletries) from the five categories. 29-30 Conclusion 11-12 This objective discusses the **kalpya-akalpya** (permissible and impermissible) of **dhaanya** (grains), **sura** (liquor), **jal** (water), **agni** (fire), **deepak** (lamp), and **khaadyapadaarth** (food) in a house, the **kalpya-akalpya** of places, the need to seek permission from the **Shayyaa-swaami** (owner of the lodging), the **kalpya-akalpya** of food owned by the **Shayyaa-tar** (one who provides lodging), the categories of permissible **vastra** and **rajo-haran**, etc. // Second Objective Ends // 14-28 29-30

## Third Objective: Prohibition of Nirgranthis and Nirgranthis residing in each other's company

1. It is not permissible for Nirgranthis to reside in the company of Nirgranthis, whether they are: 1. Standing, 2. Sitting, 3. Lying down, 4. Sleeping, 5. Drowsing, 6. Eating, 7. Drinking, 8. Consuming Khadim, 9. Consuming Sadim food, 10. Excreting, 11. Urinating, 12. Expelling phlegm, 13. Cleaning nasal discharge, 14. Studying, 15. Meditating, or 16. Performing Kayotsarga. 

2. It is not permissible for Nirgranthis to reside in the company of Nirgranthis, whether they are standing or performing Kayotsarga.

**Discussion:** Generally, Sadhus should not reside in the company of Sadhvis, and Sadhvis should not reside in the company of Sadhus. If it is necessary to do so due to some reason, they should perform their tasks while standing and return quickly. They should not engage in the activities mentioned in the Sutras. Because staying for a long time can lead to various apprehensions, and increased familiarity can lead to a breach of Brahmacharya. It is also considered inappropriate for Sadhus and Sadhvis to eat, drink, or dispose of excreta in each other's company.

In the seventh chapter of the Vyavahar Upadesh, it is stated that Sadhvis can visit Sadhus to listen to their studies and share their own. Therefore, it is permissible for Sadhvis to visit Sadhus for this purpose. The Thanang Sutra also mentions that visiting each other for service and other tasks is permissible.

**Rules regarding the acceptance of leather by Sadhus and Sadhvis:**

3. It is not permissible for Nirgranthis to accept leather from a woman.

4. It is permissible for Nirgranthis to accept leather from a woman if: 1. It is offered by a respected person, 2. It is not offered by a non-respected person, 3. It is offered by a single person, 4. It is not offered by multiple people.

[Third Objective] [177 5. It is not permissible for a Niggantha or a Nigganthi to possess or use a piece of leather with hair. 6. It is permissible for a Niggantha or a Nigganthi to possess or use a piece of leather without hair. It should be used, not new. It should be returned, not not returned. It should be brought for use for only one night, not for many nights. 3. It is not permissible for Nirgranthis to use leather with hair. 4. It is permissible for Nirgranthis to use leather with hair. It should be used, not new. It should be returned, not not returned. It should be brought for use for only one night, not for many nights. 5. It is not permissible for Nirgranthis and Nirgranthis to possess or use a whole piece of leather. 6. It is permissible for Nirgranthis and Nirgranthis to possess or use a piece of leather. / Discussion - In the general description of the Sadhu-Sadhvi, mention is made of clothes, utensils, blankets, etc. It is generally not permissible for Sadhu-Sadhvi to keep leather equipment, but if it is necessary to keep leather due to illness, etc., it is permissible to keep a piece of leather without hair. The reason for this is that in the situation of washing clothes with blood or stool, etc., the use of leather makes it convenient. The patient also suffers less. / The prohibition of whole leather is because a long and wide piece of leather with divisions for hands and feet, etc., is unnecessary. / A limited cut piece of leather is suitable. There is a possibility of life arising in leather with hair, so it is unacceptable for Sadhu-Sadhvis. / The provision in the sutra for a Sadhu to take leather with hair with many restrictions also indicates that leather with hair is unacceptable. / If a Sadhu has skin disease or piles, etc., and experiences extreme pain while sitting or sleeping, then leather with hair is more useful than leather without hair, so the provision for its acceptance for special reasons has been made. Also, some restrictions have been mentioned to avoid the contradiction arising from the birth of life, the meaning of which is as follows: Blacksmiths, goldsmiths, etc., who work near fire sitting on leather all day long, do not have the possibility of life arising in that leather with hair for some time. / Therefore, the permission has been given to accept leather with hair as a gift for those who always work. If it is kept for a long time, the heat of the fire will not be available, and there is a possibility of life arising in that leather with hair. Therefore, keeping it for a long time is prohibited.

[178] The reason why the *Bahutkalpasutra* prohibits *Sadhvis* from wearing *saromacharma* (leather with hair) is that it is difficult for them to find such leather and follow the many restrictions associated with it. Additionally, the possibility of experiencing a touch similar to that of a man in *saromacharma* could hinder their *brahmacharya* (celibacy). The commentary mentions many reasons for wearing *romarhit charmakhand* (hairless leather). These include wearing it during *sanhdiwat* (rheumatism), extreme cold or heat, when unable to walk, when vision becomes weak, or when blisters develop on the feet. The commentary describes various types of *kritsna* (whole) and *akritsna* (partial) leather and their uses in different situations. It is essential to study the commentary to understand these details.

**Rules for *Sadhus* and *Sadhvis* regarding clothing:**

7. It is not permissible for *nigganthas* (Jain monks) or *nigganthis* (Jain nuns) to wear or use *kritsna* (whole) garments.
8. It is permissible for *nigganthas* or *nigganthis* to wear or use *akritsna* (partial) garments.
9. It is not permissible for *nigganthas* or *nigganthis* to wear or use *abhinna* (unseparated) garments.
10. It is permissible for *nigganthas* or *nigganthis* to wear or use *bhinna* (separated) garments.

**Discussion:**

In these sutras, the terms *kritsna-akritsna* and *abhinna-bhinna* are synonymous. The reason for having separate sutras for them is that the *kritsna* sutras describe the *varna* (color), *mulya* (value), etc., of the garment, which are *bhavakritsna* (whole in terms of qualities), while the *abhinna* sutras describe the *prakhunda than* (large piece) or the very long and wide garment, which is *dravya kritsna* (whole in terms of substance).

The commentator, while explaining *kritsna* (whole) garments in detail, states that *kritsna* garments are of four types based on *dravya* (substance), *kshetra* (area), *kala* (time), and *bhava* (quality). Among these, *dravya kritsna* (whole in terms of substance) is further divided into two types: *sakal-dravya kritsna* (whole in terms of all substance) and *praman-dravya kritsna* (whole in terms of quantity).

A garment that has its beginning and end parts, has a border, is soft to touch, and is free from blemishes like soot, black or yellow spots, etc., is called *sakal-dravya kritsna* (whole in terms of all substance). This is further divided into three types based on quality: *jghanya* (inferior), *madhyama* (medium), and *utkrista* (superior). *Mukhavastrika* (face cloth) etc. are *jghanya* (inferior) *dravya kritsna*, *chola patta* (upper garment) etc. are *madhyama* (medium), and *chadar* (sheet) is *utkrista* (superior) *dravya kritsna*.

Garments that are longer and wider than the prescribed length and width are called *praman-dravya kritsna* (whole in terms of quantity).

Page #133:
---------------------------
## The Third Requisite

[179] A garment that is rare in a particular region is called **Kshetra-Kritsna**. A garment made in one country is often valuable and rare in another country. A garment that is expensive in a particular time period is called **Kala-Kritsna**. For example, during the summer, cotton, silk, and other thin garments are valuable, while during the winter, thick woolen garments are valuable, and during the rainy season, colorful garments become valuable.

There are two types of **Bhaava-Kritsna**: **Varna-Yuta** and **Mulyayuta**. **Varna-Yuta** garments have five variations, such as black, blue, etc. **Mulyayuta** garments are also of three types: **Jghanya**, **Madhyama**, and **Utkrisht**. Where the price of a garment is low, it is **Jghanya**, and where the price of the same garment is high, it is **Utkrisht**. A garment that is available everywhere at the same price is called **Madhyama**. Alternatively, a garment that evokes attachment is called **Bhaava-Kritsna**, meaning a beautiful garment with excessive shine and splendor.

All four types of **Kritsna** garments are unsuitable for monks or nuns to keep or wear. Commenting on the disadvantages of keeping or wearing them, the commentator has said that carrying extra garments during travel is burdensome. Thieves or robbers can steal fine, valuable garments, or any unruly person can snatch them. When entering another state, customs officials may demand taxes or confiscate the garments. A lay person, seeing such garments near a monk, may feel disgust or contempt.

For these reasons, all four types of **Kritsna** garments are not suitable for monks and nuns. However, they should wear garments that are inexpensive or in appropriate quantity, readily available in all regions and times, and not valuable in terms of attachment.

**Avgrahanantak** and **Avgrahapattak** for monks and nuns:

11. It is not appropriate for monks to keep or use **Avgrahanantak** and **Avgrahapattak**.
12. It is appropriate for monks to keep or use **Avgrahanantak** and **Avgrahapattak**.

Page #134:
---------------------------
[180] The [Gṛhatkalpasūtra] commentary refers to the loincloth or kaupīna that covers the private parts as *avagrahanantak* and the garment that covers it as *avagrahapattak*. The first sūtra prohibits both for monks, while the second sūtra prescribes both for nuns. Although the sūtra clearly prohibits both these items for monks, the commentator has written that if a monk suffers from a disease like fistula or piles, he can wear the *avagrahapattak* to protect other garments from blood and pus. The reason for nuns to keep and wear both these items is that during menstruation, their clothes should not be stained with blood. Therefore, it is prescribed that they should use both these garments during that time and keep them nearby at other times. It is also necessary to wear these items for the protection of virtue in the monastery, etc. Question: How many garments and utensils are prescribed for nuns? Answer: The *niyukti* and the commentator have instructed to keep 25 types of *upadhi*. Their names are as follows: 1. *pātra*, 2. *pātrabandha*, 3. *pātrasthāpana*, 4. *pātrakesarikā*, 5. *paṭalak*, 6. *rajastrāṇa*, 7. *gocchaka*, 8-10. three sheets (covering garments), 11. *rajoharaṇa*, 12. *mukhavastrikā*, 13. *mātraka*, 14. *kamḍhaka* (garment worn in the place of *cholapaṭṭaka*, *śāṭikā*), 15. *avagrahanantak* (loincloth covering the private parts), 16. *avagrahapattak* (garment wrapped around the waist over the loincloth), 17. *osaka* (garment like a loincloth covering the thighs), 18. *calanikā* (larger than *ardhāsoka*, covering the knees), 19. *abhyantara nivasinī* (covering half the knees), 20. *bahirnivasiṇī* (covering the ankles), 21. *kancuka* (blouse), 22. *aupakṣikī* (worn over the blouse), 23. *vaikṣikī* (covering the *kancuka* and *aupakṣikī*), 24. *saṅghāṭī* (worn in the residence), 25. *skandhakarṇī* (garment to be worn on the shoulder). Thus, there are 25 *upadhi* or items for Āryikās. The commentator has also prescribed that beautiful nuns should keep or wear *kubja-karṇī* along with *skandhakarṇī*. This means that lustful men may be attracted by the sight of a beautiful nun, so to make her look deformed, a bundle of clothes is placed on her back and tied, making her look hunchbacked. This is why this *upadhi* is called *kubja-karṇī*. In addition, the commentator has described the minimum and maximum number of garments and *upadhi* that monks and nuns can keep, as well as other important topics and duties. All these details should be known by those who are curious from the *sabhāṣya* *bṛhatkalpasūtra*. It is forbidden for a nun to accept clothes from her relatives: 13. *nigganthīe ya gāhāvaikulam piṇḍavāyapḍiyāe aṇuppavitāe celatthe samuppannejja no se kappi appano nissāe celam paḍiggahēttae*.

---------------------------
## Third Objective] [181 It is not proper for a nun to accept clothes from her own *nisra* when she is staying at a householder's house for food. It is not proper for her to accept clothes from her own *nisra* even if there are *saamanas* (monks) present, whether they are *aacharyas*, *upaadhyaayas*, *pravarttaks*, *sthaviras*, *ganis*, *ganadharas*, or *ganavachchedakas*, or if she is staying with them. It is not proper for her to accept clothes from her own *nisra* even if she is staying with someone else who is more important than them.  /  It is proper for her to accept clothes from the *nisra* of the *pravarttini* (leader of the group).  /  .13. If a nun needs clothes while staying at a householder's house for food, it is not proper for her to accept clothes from her own *nisra*, saying, "I am taking this cloth for myself."  /  But she can accept clothes from the *nisra* of the *pravarttini*.  /  She should clearly tell the householder, "I am accepting this cloth from the *nisra* of the *pravarttini*. If she accepts it and gives it to a nun, it will be kept, otherwise it will be returned to you."  /  Only then can she accept the cloth from the householder, otherwise not.  /  If her *pravarttini* is not in the *upaashraya* (monastery) or in that village, she can accept the cloth from the *nisra* of the *aacharya*, *upaadhyaaya*, or other *sadhujanas* (holy people) mentioned in the scriptures who are nearby.  /  The characteristics of the *aacharya* etc. mentioned in the scriptures are as follows: 1. An *aacharya* is one who himself follows the five *praacharas* (principles) of knowledge, vision, conduct, austerity, and vigor, and makes his disciples follow them. He is the master of the *sadhusangh* (community of monks) and is skilled in the *anugraha-nigraha* (grace and punishment), *saaran-vaaran* (praise and blame), and *dhaaran* (holding) of the *sangh*. He is knowledgeable about the state of the world and is endowed with *aacharasampada* (wealth of conduct) and other *paatha sampadas* (wealth of scriptures).  /  Vyav. U. 3, Sutra. 5 He is the holder of the qualities and scriptures mentioned.  /  2. An *upaadhyaaya* is one who is himself an expert in the *dwadashaangashruta* (twelve-part scriptures) and teaches the *praagamas* (ancient scriptures) to the disciples who come to him for study.  /  Vyav. U. 3, Sutra. 3 He is the holder of the qualities and scriptures mentioned.  /  3. A *pravarttak* is one who, seeing the ability or interest of the *sadhus*, appoints them to the tasks assigned by the *aacharya* and to *tapa* (austerity), *sanayama* (self-control), *yoga* (meditation), *vaiyaavrutya* (conduct), *seva* (service), *shushrusha* (care), *adhyayana* (study), and *adhyaapana* (teaching).  /  4. A *sthavir* is one who, seeing laxity in the self-control of the *sadhus* or seeing them deviate from self-control, gives them advice about the dangers (undesirable things or faults) of this world and the next and makes them firm in their duties.  /  5. A *gani* is one who is the master of a group of *sadhus* and takes care of the *sadhvis* (nuns) and their arrangements.

Page #136:
---------------------------
[182] The one who performs the Brihatkalpa Sutra is called a **Pracharaya**. Or, under the guidance of the main **Pracharaya**, there are many **Pracharayas**, they are called **Gan**s. 6. **Ganadhara** - who leads a group of monks. 7. **Ganavcchedaka** - who manages the food, accommodation, medicine, and atonement of the monks. It has been explained that the order of these seven ranks is as follows: A **Sadhvi** should not take clothes from her own guidance, but from her **Pravartiini**. If she is not available, then she should take it from the **Pracharaya** of the **Sangha**. In their absence, she should take it from the **Upadhyaya**. In this way, in the absence of the higher rank holders, she should take the clothes from the lower rank holders. If none of these rank holders are available, then she should take the clothes from any other **Sadhu** or **Sadhvi** who understands the **Geetaarth**. But a **Sadhvi** should not take clothes from her own guidance.

The rules for the robes to be taken at the time of initiation are as follows: 14. A **Niggantha** who is being initiated for the first time after renouncing worldly life, is eligible to receive **Rajoharan**, **Gochchhak**, **Patra**, and three **Akhand** robes. If he has been initiated before, then he is not eligible to receive **Rajoharan**, **Gochchhak**, **Patra**, and three **Akhand** robes. But he is eligible to receive the robes he had received before. 15. A **Nigganthi** who is being initiated for the first time after renouncing worldly life, is eligible to receive **Rajoharan**, **Gochchhak**, **Patra**, and four **Akhand** robes. If she has been initiated before, then she is not eligible to receive **Rajoharan**, **Gochchhak**, **Patra**, and four **Akhand** robes.

---------------------------
## Third Objective] [183 But it is permissible for a monk to be ordained with previously accepted clothes / This sutra explains which articles a monk who accepts the Samayika-charitra and Chhedopasthapaniya-charitra should take for ordination. The one who is being ordained for the first time should take ordination with Rajoharan, Gochchak (Pramarjanika), Patra and three Kritsnavastra given by his parents or relatives. A piece of cloth one hand wide and twenty-four hands long is considered a Kritsnavastra / This means that he should be ordained with three pieces of cloth, each seventy-two hands long, along with the Rajoharan etc. equipment / After this, when he has his major ordination or when he incurs pollution in a particular vow or when he violates a Mahavrata, and he appears before the Acharya for re-ordination, he can take ordination with his previously accepted clothes and utensils, i.e. he does not need to take new clothes and utensils instead of the old ones / For detailed information regarding the articles, see Nishita U. 16, Su. 39. The description of the articles of a Sadhvi who takes ordination is also similar, but instead of three Kritsnavastra, they have four Kritsnavastra. Because their clothing equipment is slightly more. The clear meaning of three or four Akhand Vastra is not available in the commentary. Therefore, different traditions of different meanings are prevalent. The concept of 72 hand cloth measurement is also not very ancient, but it seems to be closer to the intention of the Agamas. In the first and second Samvasarana, the method of accepting clothes is prohibited 16. No Kapphah Nigganthan or Nigganthin va Padhamsamosaranuddesapattai Chelai Padighahettae / 17. Kapphai Nigganthan va Nigganthin va-Dochchasamosaranuddesapattai Chelai Padighahettae. 16. It is not permissible for Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis to accept clothes in the first Samvasarana. 17. It is permissible for Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis to accept clothes in the second Samvasarana / Discussion - The word Samvasarana means to receive from all sides. Sadhus and Sadhvis stay in one suitable place for Chaturmas, so it is called the first Samvasarana, and the time after the rainy season or Chaturmas is called the second Samvasarana. After arriving at the place where the Sadhus and Sadhvis are to perform Chaturmas, it is not permissible to take clothes from householders for the entire rainy season, i.e. from Prashtadh Shukla Purnima to Kartik Shukla Purnima. But after the rainy season, in the second Samvasarana, i.e. from Margashirsha Krishna Pratipada to Ashadh Shukla Purnima, during the Paath Maas, if they need clothes in that country and time, they can take them from householders / The Niyuktikara and the Bhashyakara have described all other known things related to Chaturmas in detail.

## 184] [Brihatkalpa Sutra: The Law of Receiving Clothes and Other Possessions According to One's Ratnas (Merits)

**18. It is the law that Nigganthas (male ascetics) and Nigganthis (female ascetics) should receive clothes in the order of their Charitraparaya (spiritual progress).**

**Explanation:** A Sadhu (male ascetic) or Sadhvi (female ascetic) with a higher Charitraparaya is called a Ratnas (one with merits). When a Sadhu or Sadhvi receives clothes from a householder, they should be received in the order of their Charitraparaya. The Sadhu or Sadhvi with the highest Charitraparaya should be given clothes first, followed by those with lower Charitraparaya. The word "clothes" here is a general term, so other possessions like bowls, etc., should also be received and given according to the order of Charitraparaya. Giving or receiving in reverse order would be disrespectful to the Ratnas, leading to envy and other negative emotions, which are against the principles of Sadhu conduct. The Bhashyakar (commentator) has prescribed atonement for Sadhus and Sadhvis who give or receive in reverse order.

**19. It is the law that Nigganthas and Nigganthis should receive beds and bedding in the order of their Charitraparaya.**

**Explanation:** The word "bed" refers to a dwelling or shelter. The things used for sitting, like mats, cushions, etc., are called "bedding." These should also be received in the order of Charitraparaya.

The Niyuktikar (author) and Bhashyakar, while establishing the law of receiving beds and bedding according to one's Ratnas, have further clarified that after the Acharya, Upadhyaya, and Pravartaka (three types of spiritual teachers), the Sadhu who has come from another gana (group) to receive knowledge and other merits should be given a place for his bed and bedding. After him, the sick Sadhu should be given a place, followed by the Sadhu with fewer possessions (clothes), then the Sadhu striving for Karmakshaya (destruction of karmas), then the Sadhu who has taken a vow to not wear clothes at night, then the Sthavira (elder), then the Gani, Ganadhara, Ganavacchedaka (different types of spiritual leaders), and finally other Sadhus should be given a place for their beds and bedding.

It is further explained that a newly initiated or young Sadhu should be given a place to sleep near a Ratnas Sadhu, who can take care of him at night. Similarly, a Sadhu who is traveling should be given a place near a sick Sadhu, so that he can take care of the sick Sadhu as needed. And a Shaiksha Sadhu (student) who is studying scriptures should be given a place near the Upadhyaya, etc., with whom he is studying, so that he can receive help from them during his study sessions.

## Third Objective: [185] The Law of Performing the Right Ritual Actions

**20. It is proper for the Nigganthas and Nigganthis to perform the following actions in the order of their ethical categories:**

**20. It is proper to pay respects to the Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis in the order of their ethical categories.**

**Explanation:** The actions of respect, bowing, etc., performed towards the Guru and the Ratnadhikas before starting the Pratikraman, etc., at times like morning and evening, are called "Kritikarma." There are two types of Kritikarma: Abhyutthan and Vandanak.

Standing up when the Acharya, Upadhyaya, and other Gurus, as well as those who are senior in the initiation category, are coming or going is called "Abhyutthan Kritikarma." Bowing to the Gurus in the morning, evening, and during Pratikraman, as well as when asking a question, etc., by joining the hands and placing the palms together on the forehead, etc., is called "Vandanak Kritikarma." The commentator has said that one should perform the five-limbed salutation with the head, with a simple heart like that of a child, making three revolutions in each direction. The act of revolving with both hands joined together, as in circumambulation, is called "Pavart." These revolutions are performed to express devotion with a pure mind, speech, and body. The intention of revolving in all four directions is that I am also paying respects and bowing to all the five Supreme Beings, Gurus, and Ratnadhika Sadhus who are present in those directions, with the purity and devotion of Triyoga. Similarly, when Sadhus and Sadhvis come near the Gurus, they should pay respects to them according to their initiation category. There are many different interpretations of this Kritikarma according to different sects. It is said that it is necessary to perform the Kritikarma according to the Ratnadhika of one's sect, knowing these interpretations. The commentator has also described in detail the 32 faults of Kritikarma and finally written that one should perform Kritikarma free from all these faults, otherwise it becomes liable for atonement.

**21. It is not proper for the Nigganthas or Nigganthis to stay in the house of a householder:**

**1. To eat food offered by them, 2. To sit down, 3. To be comfortable, 4. To sleep, 5. To lie down, 6. To eat food, 7. To drink water, 8. To eat food, 9. To drink water, 10. To speak, 11. To wear clothes, 12. To play, 13. To wear ornaments, 14. To engage in conversation, 15. To meditate, 16. To keep a bed.**

**However, it is proper to stay in the house of a householder if they are:**

**Old, weak, ascetic, sick, unconscious, or injured.**

**It is proper to stay in the house of a householder if they are old, weak, ascetic, sick, unconscious, or injured.**

## 186] [Brihatkalpa Sutra 21. It is not permissible for Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis to: 1. Stay, 2. Sit, 3. Sleep, 4. Take a nap, 5. Drowse, 6. Eat, 7. Drink, 8. Serve food, 9. Consume palatable food, 10. Excrete, 11. Urinate, 12. Spit, 13. Cleanse phlegm, 14. Study scriptures, 15. Meditate, 16. Remain in a state of Kayotsarga within a householder's home. / However, it is permissible for a monk who is ill, elderly, an ascetic, weak, fatigued, or experiencing anxiety, to stay in a householder's home if they fall unconscious and remain in a state of Kayotsarga until they regain consciousness. / Discussion: A monk who has gone out for alms should not stay, sit, or engage in other activities mentioned in the sutra within a householder's home, as it may lead to various doubts and suspicions among the householders. / This is the path of renunciation. _An exception is mentioned: If a monk is ill, very old, weakened by asceticism, or weak, or if they are about to faint and fall, they may stay in a householder's home for a short time. The commentator has mentioned some other reasons for staying. For example, if a monk goes to a house to get medicine for a sick person and the medicine provider is not at home, the householders may say, "Stay for a while, the medicine provider will be back soon." Or, if it starts raining after entering the house, or if a royal procession or a wedding procession passes by on the same route, the monk may stay there. 

## The rule of limited conversation in a householder's home 22. It is not permissible for Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis to speak four or five verses, explain their meaning, describe the fruits of righteous conduct, or engage in detailed discussions within a householder's home. / However, it is permissible to speak only one example, one question and answer, one verse, or one verse in the form of a shloka, if necessary. They should speak while standing, not sitting. / Discussion: Monks and nuns who have gone out for alms should not recite verses, shlokas, etc., while standing in a householder's home. This is the path of renunciation. The commentator has explained the reason for this: If a monk stands in a place where someone else is present, it may lead to...

Page #141:
---------------------------
[Third Objective] [187 If any object is stolen, its owner may accuse that a certain monk or nun was standing there / Therefore, they have taken my object, etc. / In addition, in response to a controversial question of a householder, time will be spent in accusation and counter-accusation. His fellow monks, who eat together in a congregation, will wait. Therefore, he will be a participant in the obstacle due to not being able to eat on time. Secondly, if he has promised a sick monk, "Today I will bring you suitable food and drink soon", then by getting involved in an argument, he will not be able to return on time, and he will suffer from hunger and thirst and will experience more suffering, etc. For these reasons, monks and nuns who have gone to Gochari should not engage in excessive conversation anywhere, otherwise they will be liable for many penances from Chaturlaghu to the best of their ability. / It has been stated as an exception that if a curious person asks a monk or nun who has gone to Gochari, 'What is the characteristic of Dharma?', then he should only give the brief answer, "Ahimsa Paramo Dharmaḥ". / If someone asks again to explain Dharma, then he should only say, "Whatever you consider desirable or undesirable for yourself, consider the same for others", this is the essence of Jainism. If the curious person asks for proof in support of the said statement, then he should say a verse that denotes the meaning / Such as "Savvabhuyapabhuyasss, Sammam Bhuyaai Paaso / Pihiyasavass Dantass, Pavam Kammam Na Bandhai || - Dasavai. A. 4, Ga. 9 He should say it while standing, not sitting. Otherwise, due to the above mentioned faults, he will be liable for penance. The provision of a limited Dharmakatha in the house of a householder 23. No Kappi Nigganthaan Va Nigganthiin Va Antargihansi, Imai Panch Mahvavvaai Sabhavanai Aikkhithtae Va, Vibhavittae Va, Kittithtae Va, Paveittae Va. Nannaty Eganaen Va Jav Egasiloen Va; Se Vi Ya Thiccha, No Chev Nam Athiccha. 23. It is not appropriate for Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis to speak about the five great vows, their meaning, or the fruits of observing the great vows in the house of a householder, with feeling, or with detailed explanation. / But it is appropriate to speak only with one example or one verse, if necessary. He should do so while standing, but not sitting. In the previous sutra, the method of conversation was prohibited when asked by someone / In the present sutra, the method of speaking about the great vows is prohibited /

Page #142:
---------------------------
## 188] It is not appropriate for Sadhus and Sadhvis to narrate the five great vows in a householder's home, along with their meaning, explanation, and description of worldly benefits, and to reveal the otherworldly fruits of heaven and liberation. The commentator has explained the reason for this, stating that if a Sadhu begins to preach the great vows in detail, and a pregnant woman listening to him experiences some harm due to the restriction of food and drink for the fetus while she sits there, then the preacher becomes a participant in her violence. Alternatively, if a woman in the house goes out at that time to relieve herself, and a woman who harbors animosity towards her, either a co-wife or another envious woman, kills her child and brings it to the Sadhu, throwing it down and shouting that the Sadhu killed it, then people might suspect the Sadhu of causing the death. Similarly, if a Sadhu, when asked, says that it is not appropriate for him to preach in a householder's home, and then preaches elsewhere, he incurs the sin of falsehood. If, during the Sadhu's preaching, a maid in the house takes the opportunity to steal some jewelry or other valuables, and after the Sadhu leaves, the householder accuses the Sadhu of theft, then the Sadhu is implicated in the theft.  /  _ If a woman's husband is away, and she uses the pretext of listening to the preaching to keep the Sadhu for a while and then requests sexual intercourse, and the Sadhu is swayed, or if she tempts the Sadhu with the promise of fine clothes, utensils, etc., then the Sadhu incurs a transgression of the great vows. Therefore, the sutra prohibits the narration of the five great vows, their meaning, and other detailed discourses in a householder's home. If someone who is sick or curious asks about the nature of the great vows, then the Sadhu should answer briefly, with a single verse or a single shloka, and should do so while standing, not sitting. Because a wandering mendicant stands while begging. Sitting there creates many doubts.  /  Therefore, sitting is completely prohibited. The rule for returning the householder's bedding is as follows: 24. No Nirgrantha or Nirgranthi should leave for another village without returning the bedding to its owner. 24. It is not appropriate for Nirgranthas and Nirgranthis to leave for another village without returning the bedding to its owner.  /  Discussion: The Sadhu's entire body, including the back-rest, straw, etc., is called "bedding," and the back-rest, straw, etc., measuring two and a half hands is called "bedding."  /  Those who are brought to return the bedding are called "attendants."  /  When a Sadhu arrives in a village, he should find suitable bedding, a blanket, etc.

Page #143:
---------------------------
[Third Objective] [189] It is not proper for a Sadhu or Sadhvi to leave for another village without returning the bedding and other items taken from the house of a householder. If they leave without returning them, they are liable to atonement. If they leave without returning them, it leads to the Sadhu's lack of respect and criticism, making it difficult to obtain bedding and other items in the future. The term "bedding and other items" is used here as a metaphor. Therefore, whatever items a Sadhu or Sadhvi takes from the householder's house, they should return them before leaving for another place.

The rule for returning the bedding and other items of the householder is as follows:

25. It is not proper for the Nigganthas or Nigganthis to leave for another village without returning the bedding and other items of the householder in the same condition as they were received.

26. It is proper for the Nigganthas or Nigganthis to leave for another village after returning the bedding and other items of the householder in the same condition as they were received.

**Discussion:** Returning the bedding and other items of the householder in the same condition as they were received is called "Vikaran". If they are not placed in the same place and not arranged in the same way, it is called "Avikaran". This sutra instructs that the bedding and other items of the householder should be placed in the same place and arranged in the same way before leaving for another village. Otherwise, the Sadhu or Sadhvi are liable to atonement.

The method of returning the bedding and other items is described in Pracha. Shru. 2, A. 2, U. 3. It means that they should be carefully examined and cleaned. If necessary, they should be aired or exposed to sunlight. They should be returned only after they are completely free of life. If they are soiled due to use, they should be washed and wiped clean. If they are torn or damaged, they should be returned with a polite explanation. The commentary states that if the bamboo sticks used to tie the bedding are tied or untied, they should be returned in their original condition.

The purpose of all these rules is to ensure that the Sadhu or Sadhvi are respected, the bedding and other items are easily available, and the third great vow is followed in its purest form.

190 [Bahutkalpasutra] **Provision for the investigation of a lost bed-spread** 27. If a Niggantha or Nigganthi, a Padihari or a Sagari, loses their bed-spread, they should investigate it. If they find it while investigating, it should be given back to them. If they do not find it while investigating, then it is appropriate to take another bed-spread after seeking permission from a wise person. 

The commentator has stated that a Sadhu should be careful to protect any bed-spread or other items that they have requested from a householder's home and should not leave the shelter unattended. If they need to go out for Gochari or other reasons, they should appoint someone to guard the shelter. If someone steals it while they are away to relieve bodily needs, or while they are engrossed in reading or studying, or if someone runs away with it while it is being brought from the householder's home or while it is being returned, or if someone takes it while it is being kept outside in the sun, or if it is lost for any other reason, then the Sadhu should immediately investigate it. 

If they find the person who took it while investigating, they should ask them to return it, saying, "O noble one! I have requested this from a householder. If you have taken it, please return it to us." If they are unwilling to return it, they should encourage them to do so by reciting religious verses. If they still refuse, they should offer them a reward. If they are a government official and refuse even after being asked, then the Sadhu should try to get it back by using appropriate means, as far as possible. If they still refuse, they should send a message to higher authorities and try to get it back. If they still cannot find it or cannot find the person who took it, they should tell the householder from whose home they brought the bed-spread or other items about its disappearance. If they can somehow get it back, they should use it again after seeking permission from a wise person. If they cannot get it back, they should request another bed-spread. If the Sadhu does not investigate in this appropriate manner, they are liable for atonement.

---------------------------
## Third Objective

[191 At the end, the commentator has also written that if the owner of the bed-furniture has been expelled from the country by the king, or if he has gone elsewhere with his family, or if he has attained death, or if the sadhu himself is unable to search due to illness, old age, etc., or if there is any other such reason, then in such a situation, even without searching for the lost bed-furniture, the sadhu is not a participant in the atonement. The provision for the stay of visiting ascetics 28. If the ascetics-nirgranthas leave the bed-furniture, on that day or at that time, other ascetics-nirgranthas come, then they can stay for as long as they want, taking the bed-furniture with the previous permission. / 29. If there is any unused equipment in the shelter, then it can also be used for as long as they want, with the previous permission. / Discussion - In the shelter where the sadhu has stayed with permission for a month or a year, if other sadhus come to stay there on the day they leave, then they can stay for 'as long as they want' without taking permission from the owner of the shelter. For them, the previous acceptance taken by the sadhus who stayed there earlier will be considered for that period. The permission taken by the previously staying sadhus includes the permission for their fellow sadhus to stay. / Therefore, any sadhu can come and stay with them at any time. They do not need to take permission again. If the previously staying sadhus leave after their arrival, then they can stay there according to their own time. 'As long as they want' here means 'as long as the time is suitable'. If the previously staying sadhus have left and handed over the house to the owner, and then some sadhus come, then they need to take permission again. If the owner of the house has given permission by specifying the number of sadhus or the limit of the house, then if more sadhus come or if they want to use more space than the limit of the house, then they need to take permission again. If they stay with the permission of the previously staying sadhus, then the additional bed-furniture etc. in the shelter can also be taken with the permission of the previously staying sadhus and used for as long as they want.]

## Translation:

[192] The term 'achitt' is used in the Brihatkalpa Sutra because the upashraya may contain many 'saccitt' substances. A monk is not permitted to take 'saccitt' or living beings as equipment. Therefore, only 'achitt' and usable equipment can be taken with the prior permission of the monks. If it is known that these equipment were not previously authorized by the monks from the owner, then the visiting monk must obtain their permission. The intention of the Sutra is that there is no need to seek permission again for the house and equipment that have already been authorized by the previous monks. The rules for prior permission and re-permission for a house without an owner are as follows:

_30. For houses, buildings, unused, not divided by the family, not under the control of another, or possessed by a deity, the permission of the previously residing monks is sufficient for staying there for as long as needed. 31. For houses, buildings, used, divided by the family, or taken over by another, permission should be sought again for staying there for as long as needed for the sake of the monk's conduct, even if the house is unused._

**Explanation:**

1. **Avyaprit:** A house that is not being used by anyone due to its dilapidated condition or collapse is called 'avyaprit'.
2. **Avyakrit:** A house that is not under the control of anyone due to multiple owners is called 'avyakrit'.
3. **Aparparigrihit:** A house that has been abandoned by the owner and is not taken over by anyone else, but is without an owner, is called 'aparparigrihit'.
4. **Amarparigrihit:** A house that has been abandoned by the builder for some reason and in which a deity like a Yaksha has taken residence is called 'amarparigrihit'.

If the monks are leaving the place and other monks arrive, they do not need to seek permission again to stay there, as the permission granted by the previous monks is considered sufficient. If a deity leaves the house after the visiting monks have stayed there and a real owner arrives, then the real owner must seek permission again.

---------------------------
## Third Objective [193]

It is not proper to consume even a small amount of *adatta* (unpaid for) in the *sanayamaaryada* (rules of conduct). The consumption of *adatta* occurs when one stays at a place with the permission of an unknown owner, while the actual owner is absent, and then continues to stay there after the actual owner returns. Therefore, one should seek the permission of the actual owner upon his arrival.

The rule regarding staying in a place like a road, etc., with prior permission is as follows:

**32.** One can stay for as long as one wishes, with the permission of the previous *sadhus* (ascetics), near a wall made of mud, etc., near a wall made of bricks, etc., near a *charika* (path between a fort and a city), near a ditch, near a common path, near a fence or a fort.  

**Commentary:** If one wishes to stay near a fort, etc., on a road, or near the wall of someone's house, one should seek the permission of the owner, the passerby, or the *Shakrendra* (Indra). If other *sadhus* arrive before the *sadhus* who are already sitting there leave, they can stay with the same permission. It is not necessary for them to seek permission again. Here, the commentary explains the ownership of different areas near the wall of a house, with different measurements. The remaining land is said to be owned by the king.

## The rule regarding going to *gochari* (a place for begging) near an army camp and the atonement for staying overnight:

**33.** If there is an enemy army camp outside the village or the capital, then *nirgranthas* (male ascetics) and *nirgranthis* (female ascetics) should go to the village for begging and return on the same day. However, it is not permissible for them to stay there overnight. Any *nirgrantha* or *nirgranthi* who stays there overnight, or approves of someone staying overnight, transgresses both *jinaagna* (Jain teachings) and *rajagna* (king's order) and incurs the *chaturmasik anudghatik* (four-month atonement).

**Commentary:** The *Pracha. Shru. 2, A. 3* prohibits *sadhus* from going near an army camp. Here, the rule is that if it is absolutely necessary for *sadhus* to go to a village, etc., for *vihar* (spiritual practice), etc., they can cross the army camp and go to the village, etc., for begging. This means that during the time of an army camp, *bhikshus* (begging ascetics) are only allowed to go for begging and return immediately, and others are not allowed to enter.

Page #148:
---------------------------
[194] The *Bahutkalpasutra* should be known, but not dwelt upon. Dwelling upon it leads to violation of royal and *Jina* commands, making one liable for atonement. The evidence for the *avagrahakshetra* is from verse 34: "It is proper for the *nirgranthas* and *nirgranthis* to take an *avagraha* of one *yojana* with a radius of one *kośa* in villages or assemblies, i.e., it is proper to travel two and a half *kośas* in one direction." Explanation: It is proper for a monk to travel up to two and a half *kośas* in any one direction from his *upaśraya*, but it is not proper to travel beyond that. Although it is proper for a monk to travel only two *kośas* for *gocharī*, the intention of saying two and a half *kośas* is that if a monk who has gone two *kośas* for *gocharī* encounters an obstacle due to excrement, he can go half a *kośa* further to remove the obstacle. Thus, the total travel in one direction is two and a half *kośas*. Adding the areas of the two directions, east-west or north-south, results in five *kośas*, i.e., one and a quarter *yojanas*, which is the *avagrahakshetra*. This is what is referred to in the *sutra* as the *sakośa yojana avagrahakshetra*. The essence of the third *uddeshaka* of *sutra* 1-2 is that a monk should not sit, sleep, etc., in the *upaśraya* of a nun, and a nun should not sit, sleep, etc., in the *upaśraya* of a monk. Monks and nuns can use leather without hair if necessary, but hairy leather is not proper for them. In an extreme situation, a monk can use hairy leather that is used by a householder for one night, but it is completely forbidden for a nun. Monks and nuns should not keep expensive clothes, uncut cloth, or clothes that are longer than necessary. Monks should not keep loincloths, undergarments, etc., that are worn close to the genitals, but nuns must keep these items. A nun should not accept clothes from her own *niśrā*, but she can request clothes from other *pravṛtinī*s, etc. 7-10, 11-12.

Page #149:
---------------------------
## Third Objective [195 Sutras 14-15]

When taking initiation, monks and nuns should accept the **Rajoharan Gochchag** (cleaning cloth) and necessary utensils. For clothing like **Muhpatti**, **Chadder**, **Cholpattak**, etc., a monk can take a maximum of three **Thans** worth of cloth, while a nun can take four **Thans** worth.

[16-17] Monks and nuns should not accept clothing during **Chaturmas**, but they can take clothing during **Hemant** and **Greeshma** seasons.

[18-19-20] Healthy monks and nuns should accept clothing and bedding according to the order of the initiation ceremony, and they should also offer their respects in the same order.

[21-23] Healthy monks and nuns should not engage in activities like sitting in a householder's house, as mentioned in the sutras. They should also avoid engaging in inappropriate conversations or giving sermons there. If necessary, they can make a brief and appropriate statement while standing.

[24-26] Before leaving, monks and nuns should return the bedding and other items belonging to the householder. They should return them in the same condition as they received them. If the bedding is lost, they should search for it. If it is not found, they should inform the owner of the loss and accept another bedding. If the bedding is found later, they should return it if it is no longer needed.

[28-32] If monks and nuns are staying in an **Upashray**, an empty house, or on the road, and another monk arrives before they leave, they can stay there with the same permission they received earlier. They do not need to seek new permission. However, if the owner of an empty house appears, they must seek permission again. If there is a military camp outside the village, monks and nuns can enter for alms, but they should not stay there overnight. Staying overnight would result in the **Guru Chaturmasik** penance. Monks and nuns can travel up to two and a half **Kos** in any direction from the **Upashray** where they are staying, but not beyond that.

**Conclusion:** This objective discusses the prohibition of monks and nuns sitting in each other's **Upashrays**, the rules regarding the acceptance of leather, and other related matters.

## Fourth Objective: Anudghatik Prāyaścitta

**1. Anudghatik Prāyaścitta is applicable in the following situations:**

* **1. Hatthaphammam karemane:** One who commits a physical act (like stealing, killing, etc.)
* **2. Mehuṇam paḍisevamāṇe:** One who engages in sexual misconduct.
* **3. Raibhoyaṇam bhujamāṇe:** One who consumes food after sunset.

**Explanation:**

* **Udghatik Prāyaścitta** refers to the atonement for offenses that can be purified through ordinary penance.
* **Anudghatik Prāyaścitta** refers to the atonement for offenses that can only be purified through special penance.

A monk who commits a physical act, engages in sexual misconduct, or consumes food after sunset is considered to have committed a grave sin. The first two offenses violate the Mahavrat of Brahmacharya (celibacy), and the last violates the sixth Vrat of Ratribhaktvirman (abstinence from food after sunset). Therefore, these three offenses are subject to Anudghatik Prāyaścitta.

**10 Types of Prāyaścitta:**

The Bhagavati Sutra (Chapter 25, Verse 6, Sutra 195) and the Uvvaiyasutra (Chapter 30) mention ten types of Prāyaścitta:

1. **Ālocanā:** Confession of minor transgressions to the Guru, even while adhering to the vows.
2. **Pratikramāṇa:** Reciting "Micchā me dukkadam hojjā" (I have erred) to atone for unintentional mistakes while fulfilling one's duties.
3. **Tadu-bhay:** Combining Ālocanā and Pratikramāṇa to rectify transgressions related to the fundamental principles or secondary principles.
4. **Viveka:** Examining and discarding any food or drink that is found to be contaminated.
5. **Vyutsarga:** Performing a specific breathing exercise while standing in meditation after activities like traveling, experiencing a bad dream, or crossing a river by boat.
6. **Tap:** Performing penance prescribed by the Guru for deliberate misconduct.
7. **Chheda:** A type of penance involving specific restrictions.
8. **Mūla:** A type of penance involving complete renunciation.
9. **Anvasthāpya:** A type of penance involving permanent renunciation.
10. **Pārañcīka:** A type of penance involving severe consequences.

Page #152:
---------------------------
[198] There are two types of these - Udghatim, meaning minor atonement, and Anudghatim, meaning major atonement. Both of these have two sub-types, monthly and Chaturmasik. If a vow is broken due to being overpowered by royal authority, ghost possession, etc., then: 1. In minor monthly atonement (Udghatim), it is necessary to perform 4, 15, and 27 Ekasan for minor, medium, and severe transgressions respectively. 2. In major monthly atonement (Anudghatim), it is necessary to perform 4, 15, and 30 Nivi for minor, medium, and severe transgressions respectively. 3. In minor Chaturmasik atonement, it is necessary to perform 4 Ayambil, 60 Nivi, and 108 fasts for minor, medium, and severe transgressions respectively. 4. In major Chaturmasik atonement, it is necessary to perform 4 fasts, 4 Bele, and 120 fasts or 4 months of Diksha-ched for minor, medium, and severe transgressions respectively. If the vow is broken intentionally and with haste, then... 1. In minor monthly atonement, it is necessary to perform 4, 15, and 27 Ayambil for minor, medium, and severe transgressions respectively. 2. In major monthly atonement, it is necessary to perform 4, 15, and 30 Ayambil for minor, medium, and severe transgressions respectively. 3. In minor Chaturmasik atonement, it is necessary to perform 4 fasts, 4 Bele, and 108 fasts for minor, medium, and severe transgressions respectively. 4. In major Chaturmasik atonement, it is necessary to perform 4 Bele, 4 days of Diksha-ched, 4 Tele and 6 days of Diksha-ched, and 120 fasts and 4 months of Diksha-ched for minor, medium, and severe transgressions respectively. If the vow is broken due to the strong emergence of Mohaniya Karma, then: 1. In minor monthly atonement, it is necessary to perform 4, 15, and 27 fasts for minor, medium, and severe transgressions respectively. 2. In major monthly atonement, it is necessary to perform 4, 15, and 30 fasts for minor, medium, and severe transgressions respectively. 3. In minor Chaturmasik atonement, it is necessary to perform 4 Bele, Ayambil during Parana, 4 Tele, Ayambil during Parana, and 108 fasts and Ayambil during Parana for minor, medium, and severe transgressions respectively. 4. In major Chaturmasik atonement, it is necessary to perform 4 Tele, Ayambil during Parana or 40 days of Diksha-ched, 15 Tele, Ayambil during Parana or 60 days of Diksha-ched, and 120 fasts and Ayambil during Parana or Mula (new initiation) or 120 days of Diksha-ched for minor, medium, and severe transgressions respectively. During the reign of Lord Mahavira, the maximum atonement was six months. If more atonement is required, then Diksha-ched atonement is performed. In minor six months, there are 165 fasts, and in major six months, there are 180 fasts. The Acharya and other disciples, while giving atonement, consider the strength of the disciple and the circumstances of the vow-breaking and give appropriate lesser or greater atonement.

Page #153:
---------------------------
[Fourth Uddeshaka] [199 7. The expiation for the renunciation of the diksha of a monk who violates the vows and indulges in the exceptional path without reason is called 'Cheda Prayashchitta'. This expiation is also for six months. If more expiation is required, the original (new diksha) expiation is given.

8. Mula - If a monk-nun knowingly and with hatred kills any five-sensed being, and similarly indulges in the sin of false speech etc. many times and does not perform self-confession, then the complete cutting off of his/her previous diksha is called 'Mula Prayashchitta'. Such a person with Mula Prayashchitta has to take diksha again.

9. Anavasthaapya - If one commits sins like non-abstinence from violence, theft etc. whose purification is not possible even through Mula Prayashchitta, then making him/her wear the householder's dress without re-initiating is called 'Anavasthaapya Prayashchitta'. In this, wearing the householder's dress is necessary even for a short time.

10. Paraanchika - If one's purification is not possible even through Anavasthaapya Prayashchitta due to the intensity of passions or negligence, then such a person is made to wear the householder's dress for a minimum of one year and a maximum of twelve years, and all the vows and rules of a monk are made him/her observe. After that, new diksha is given, which is called 'Paraanchika Prayashchitta'. The three types of Paraanchika Prayashchitta are: 1. Dushta Paraanchika, 2. Pramatta Paraanchika, 3. Annamana Karemana Paraanchika.

Explanation - The word 'Paraanchika' means the expiation through which the purified monk can cross the ocean of worldly existence. Or it is the last and most excellent of the ten types of expiations, which is called Paraanchika Prayashchitta. In this sutra, three types of Paraanchika Prayashchitta are mentioned. Among them, the first is Dushta Paraanchika, which has two types - Kashaya-dushta and Vishaya-dushta. 1. Kashaya-dushta - One who kills a monk etc. due to the intensity of passions like anger is Kashaya-dushta. 2. Vishaya-dushta - One who becomes attached to women like sadhvis due to the attachment to sense objects and indulges in sensual pleasures with them is called Vishaya-dushta. The five types of Pramatta Paraanchika are: 1. Madya-pramatta - Those who indulge in intoxicating substances like liquor. 2. Vishaya-pramatta - Those who are greedy for sense objects. 3. Kashaya-pramatta - Those who are intense in passions.]

Page #154:
---------------------------
[Bahatkalpasūtra 4. Those who engage in activities such as immoral speech, negligence of vows, and royal affairs are called vikathā-pramatta.  5. Those who are in deep sleep, stupor, or unconsciousness are called nidrā-pramatta. A person who gets up from deep sleep, commits dreadful deeds that are not to be done, and then goes back to sleep, and upon waking has no recollection of the misdeeds committed, is called nidrā-pramatta. A monk who engages in sexual activity with another monk is both liable for pārāñcika prāyaścitta (the most severe penance).  

In this way, the purification of the wicked, negligent, and mutually copulating is done through pārāñcika prāyaścitta. 3. The three types of anavaṣṭhāpya prāyaścitta (irrevocable penance) are: 1. One who steals from co-religionists, 2. One who steals from those of other faiths, 3. One who attacks with his own hands. 

It is stated in this sūtra that 1. A monk who steals the clothes, utensils, books, etc. of co-religionist monks. 2. One who steals the clothes, utensils, books, etc. of monks of other faiths like Buddhists, Sāṃkhyas, etc. 3. One who physically assaults others with his hands, fists, sticks, etc. or torments them through mantras and tantras - these three receive anavaṣṭhāpya prāyaścitta.

4-9. The three types of eunuchs unfit for initiation are: 1. Paṇḍaka - one with a feminine nature from birth, 2. Vātika - one unable to control sexual desires, 3. Klība - the impotent. These three are not fit to be initiated through tonsure, instruction, establishment, consecration, or cohabitation.

Page #155:
---------------------------
## Fourth Objective] [201 Similarly, it is not permissible to shave the head, educate, install, eat together in a congregation, and keep company with a **Pundak**, **Vatik**, or **Kleb**. 

**Explanation:**

1. **Pundak:** One who is impotent from birth is called a **Pundak**.
2. **Vatik:** One who is suffering from **Vataroga** (a disease that makes one incapable of controlling sexual desire) is called a **Vatik**.
3. **Kleb:** A cowardly man who is impotent or lacks masculinity is called a **Kleb**.

All three types of impotent individuals are not eligible for initiation, as initiating such individuals leads to many faults, such as mockery of the teachings and condemnation of the **Nirgrantha** Dharma.

If initiation is given to such individuals without full knowledge, and their impotence is later discovered, they should not be **mundit** (shaved) i.e., their hair should not be cut. If their impotence is discovered after their hair is cut, they should not be installed in the **mahavrata** (great vows) i.e., they should not be given the higher initiation. If their impotence is discovered after the higher initiation, they should not be allowed to eat together in a congregation. If their impotence is discovered after this, they should not be allowed to sleep or sit together.

The intention is that these three types of impotent individuals are not eligible for initiation in any way. Even if they are initiated, they are not fit to be kept in the **Sangha** (community) upon discovery.

**Characteristics of those eligible and ineligible for receiving **Vachana** (teachings):**

10. **Ineligible for receiving Vachana:**

1. **Avinie:** One who does not show **vinaya** (humility) towards the **Sutradhara** (teacher).
2. **Vigai-padibandh:** One who is attached to **vikruti** (vices).
3. **Aviossaviyapahade:** One who has not calmed their **praabhrut** (anger).

11. **Eligible for receiving Vachana:**

1. **Vinie:** One who shows **vinaya** (humility) towards the **Sutradhara** (teacher).
2. **No Vigai-padibandh:** One who is not attached to **vikruti** (vices).
3. **Viossaviyapahude:** One who has calmed their **praabhrut** (anger).

Page #156:
---------------------------
##  Translation:

**202] [Brihatkalpa Sutra Discussion-1. Avinita -** One who is devoid of humility, who does not show proper respect and reverence, such as rising to greet, upon the arrival or departure of an Acharya, a senior monk who has received Diksha, or other such dignitaries, is called 'Avinita'. 

**2. Vikriti-Prabaddha -** One who is addicted to milk, yogurt, and other such flavors, and becomes sluggish in learning Sutra-artha, etc., when these flavors are not available, is called 'Vikriti-Prabaddha'. 

**3. Avyavashmitpraabhut -** One who becomes extremely angry at a minor offense, and even after the offender apologizes, continues to express anger repeatedly, is called 'Avyavashmitpraabhut'. 

These three types of monks are unfit for Sutra-vachana and Ubha-vachana, because humility is the key to acquiring knowledge. Teaching a student who lacks humility is futile, if not harmful. One who is attached to milk, yogurt, and other such flavors, cannot retain the teachings in their heart, so giving them Vachana is also futile. One who is naturally aggressive, and expresses intense anger at the slightest offense, even after the offender apologizes, is also unfit for Vachana. Such individuals are disliked in this life and create strong negative karmic bonds for the next life. Therefore, these three types of students are considered unfit for Sutra, Artha, or both Vachana. 

However, those who are humble, not attached to milk, yogurt, and other such flavors, and are forgiving, are the ones who should be given Sutra, Artha, and both Vachana. Because the Vachana given to them expands the teachings, improves their present and future lives, and promotes the Jain teachings. 

A monk with the above-mentioned faults is also unfit for Samyama and Aradhana. He should not be given Diksha. If these faults are discovered after Diksha, he should not be kept with the Upadhyaya for Vachana, but should be guided by the Pravartaka and the Stavira to learn other studies, teachings, and ethical conduct. If he acquires the necessary qualifications, he can then be placed with the Upadhyaya for Vachana. If he does not become qualified, he should remain a student and follow the discipline of others while practicing Samyama. 

Those Gachchha-pramukhs who do not follow the prescribed methods of the Sutra, and give Vachana to everyone without discerning who is fit and unfit, and do not appoint Upadhyaya and others to give Vachana, or do not ensure that they are treated with respect and humility, are guilty of violating the Sutra-vidhan regarding Vachana. According to Nishita U. 19, they are liable for Prāyaścitta. 

These Prāyaścitta are as follows: 

1. Not giving Vachana in the prescribed order, but giving or causing to be given Vachana of any Sutra at will.

**12. Those who are Dus-sannyapya (difficult to understand) are as follows: 1. Dusht, 2. Mūḍha, 3. Vyudgrahit. 13. Those who are Su-sannyapya (easy to understand) are as follows: 1. Pravuta, 2. Amūḍha, 3. Avya-udgrahit.**

**12. These three are called Dus-sannyapya (difficult to understand), as follows: 1. Dusht - one who harbors hatred towards the teacher who imparts the essence of the scriptures, 2. Mūḍha - one who is ignorant of virtues and vices, 3. Vyudgrahit - one who is prejudiced and holds onto blind faith. / 13. These three are called Su-sannyapya (easy to understand), as follows: 1. Adusht - one who does not harbor hatred towards the teacher who imparts the essence of the scriptures, 2. Amūḍha - one who knows virtues and vices, 3. Avya-udgrahit - one who has right faith.**

**Discussion - 1. 'Dusht' is one who harbors hatred towards the Guru, etc., who formulates the scriptures, or who harbors hatred towards the essence that is being expounded. 2. 'Mūḍha' is one who is devoid of the discernment of virtues and vices. / 3. 'Vyudgrahit' is one who is extremely opinionated and holds onto contrary beliefs. All three types of Sadhus are Dus-sannyapya, meaning it is very difficult to make them understand. Even if explained, they do not understand. There is no benefit in teaching or explaining to them. Therefore, they are completely unfit for receiving the recitation of the Sutras. But those who are free from hatred, who are endowed with the discernment of benefit and harm, and who are not opinionated or hold onto contrary beliefs, are fit to receive education. / Such individuals are the ones who...**

1. The recitation of the Bṛhatkalpasūtra, the scripture and its meaning, should be given. Because they easily or conveniently grasp the propounded principles.

2. If a sick Nirgrantha's (Jain ascetic) father, brother, or son supports a falling Nirgrantha woman or wife or son, and that Nirgrantha woman gets up, then she incurs the atonement of four-monthly Anudghātika (non-violent) penance, as she has approved of the consequences of sexual intercourse.

3. If a sick Nirgrantha's mother, sister, or daughter supports a falling Nirgrantha man, and that Nirgrantha man gets up, then he incurs the atonement of four-monthly Anudghātika penance, as he has approved of the consequences of sexual intercourse.

4. The touch of a man's body for a Sādhvī (female Jain ascetic) and the touch of a woman's body for a Sādhu (male Jain ascetic) are completely prohibited for the protection of celibacy. Even in the case of illness, only a Sādhvī should attend to a Sādhvī, and a Sādhu should attend to a Sādhu, this is the Jina's instruction.

5. However, if by chance, a Sādhvī falls somewhere while coming or going due to physical weakness, and seeing this, her father, brother, or son, or any other man, lifts her up, seats her, or provides other bodily care, and if due to this touch, sexual desire arises in the mind of the Sādhvī, then she incurs the atonement of four-monthly Anudghātika penance.

6. Similarly, if a physically weak Sādhu falls somewhere, and his mother, sister, or daughter, or any other woman, lifts him up, and if due to this touch, sexual desire arises in the mind of the Sādhu, then he incurs the atonement of four-monthly Guru-cāturmāsika penance.

7. The prohibition of keeping the first watch's (early morning) food until the fourth watch (afternoon).

---------------------------
[205] It is not proper for a monk to keep food brought in the first *pौरुषी* (hour) until the last *pौरुषी*. If the food happens to remain, he should not eat it himself nor give it to another, but should take it to a secluded and deserted place, and after writing on it and cleaning it, he should throw it away. If he eats it himself or gives it to another, he incurs the penalty of *उद्घातिक चातुर्मासिक* (a type of severe penance). 

**Explanation:** *Pौरुषी* refers to an hour. Food brought in the first hour of the day should not be kept until the fourth hour. It should be consumed by the monks and nuns before that. If, due to forgetfulness or any other reason, it remains, then after the time has passed, the monks and nuns should neither eat it themselves nor feed it to others, but should take it to a secluded, deserted place, write on it and clean it, and dispose of it properly. If they do not do this and eat it themselves or give it to other monks and nuns, they become liable for the *लघु-चातुर्मासिक* (a type of minor penance). 

The commentator has further clarified in the explanation of this sutra that a *जिनकल्पी* (a type of monk) should eat the food brought in the same hour. Otherwise, he becomes liable for the sin of *संग्रहादि* (accumulation). But the *गच्छवासी* (a type of monk) can consume the food brought in the first hour until the third hour. After that, they become liable for the penance mentioned in the sutra. 

The sutra mentions all four types of food, so monks cannot keep water, fruits, nuts, and mouth fresheners until the fourth hour. If all four types of food are brought in the second hour, they can be kept and consumed until the fourth hour. Medicines can also not be kept for more than three hours. This should also be understood from the provisions of this sutra. 

The fifth *उद्देशक* (section) mentions the prohibition and exception for *लेप्य* (ointments). 

**Prohibition of carrying food beyond two *कोस* (miles):**

[17] It is not proper for a *निग्गंथ* (Jain monk) or a *निग्गंथा* (Jain nun) to carry food or drink beyond two *कोस*. However, if it is necessary for the sake of *अजोयणमेराए* (the welfare of the community), then it is permissible. If the food happens to remain, he should not eat it himself nor give it to another, but should take it to a secluded and deserted place, and after writing on it and cleaning it, he should throw it away.

---------------------------
## 206] [Brihatkalpa Sutra] It is not proper for a Nirgrantha or Nirgranthi to keep food beyond the limit of half a yojana, even if it is tasty. / 17. If, by chance, that food remains, then they should not eat it themselves nor give it to others, but should write and clean a secluded and completely unmindful place and dispose of that food properly. If they eat that food themselves or give it to other Nirgranthas or Nirgranthis, then they incur the Udghatik Chaturmasik Pratikramana. Discussion - A Bhikshu can bring food from a place two kos away from their shelter and can travel and take food, water, etc. in any direction up to two kos. If they mistakenly take it beyond that, then it is not proper to eat or drink it after knowing, but it is proper to dispose of it. / Food, etc. do not become mindful or contaminated by being taken further, but it is necessary to follow this area limit as stated in the Agamas. Two kos is four thousand dhanus, which is approximately four miles or seven kilometers. / No food, water, medicine, or any other edible material should be taken beyond this area. The method of disposing of inedible food taken unintentionally is as follows: 15. If a Niggantha, while collecting alms, receives inedible food from a householder due to lack of knowledge, then it is proper to give it to a disciple who is present. If there is no disciple present, then they should not eat it themselves nor give it to others, but should write and clean a secluded and unmindful place and dispose of it properly. 18. If a Nirgrantha, while entering a householder's house for food, receives contaminated, unmindful food or water, then _ if there is a disciple present there, then it is proper to give it to them or to give it to them after giving them edible food. If there is no disciple present, then they should not eat that inedible food themselves nor give it to others, but should write and clean a secluded and unmindful place and dispose of it properly. Discussion - After giving quick initiation, until the initiation for the whole life is given, that newly initiated Sadhu is called 'Anupasthapit Shaikshtar'.

Page #161:
---------------------------
## The Period for the Great Initiation

The period for giving the Great Initiation after the Small Initiation and establishing the Mahavrata is seven days at the lowest and six months at the highest. A newly initiated Sadhu who has not been established in the Mahavrata can be given food that is not considered suitable for consumption, but this should be done with caution. Here, "not suitable" refers to food that is contaminated with faults related to "Aeshna" (desire). Although a newly initiated Sadhu who has not been established is considered a practitioner of restraint, they do not receive any specific atonement for eating such food because their establishment is certain. Therefore, the scriptures prescribe giving them food that is suitable for consumption. If there is no such newly initiated Sadhu who has not been established in the Sadhu community, then one should neither consume such contaminated food nor give it to others, but should dispose of it in a suitable place according to the prescribed method in the scriptures. The word "Dau" in the scriptures refers to giving once, and the word "Anuppadaun" refers to inviting or giving little by little multiple times.

## The Rules for Offering Food

The rules for offering food to those who are and are not in the "Kalpa" (state of being) are as follows:

1. Food prepared for those who are in the "Kalpa" can be consumed by those who are not in the "Kalpa", but not by those who are in the "Kalpa".
2. Food prepared for those who are not in the "Kalpa" cannot be consumed by those who are in the "Kalpa", but can be consumed by others who are not in the "Kalpa".
3. Those who are in the "Kalpa" are called "Kalpasthit", and those who are not in the "Kalpa" are called "Akalpasthit".

## Explanation

Sadhus who are in the ten types of "Kalpa", including "Achelky", and follow the "Panchayam" form of Dharma are called "Kalpasthit", especially the Sadhus of the first and last Tirthankaras. Sadhus of the twenty-two intermediate Tirthankaras who are not in the ten types of "Kalpa" but are in some "Kalpas" and follow the "Chaturyaam" form of Dharma are called "Akalpasthit".

Food prepared by householders for "Kalpasthit" Sadhus cannot be consumed by them, but can be consumed by "Akalpasthit" Sadhus. Similarly, food prepared for "Akalpasthit" Sadhus can be consumed by other "Akalpasthit" Sadhus, but not by "Kalpasthit" Sadhus.

## The Ten Kalpas (Practices of the Ascetics) as described in the Brihatkalpa Sutra, Chapter 10:

1. **Achelkalpa:**  Not possessing extravagant clothing, but only modest clothing. Not wearing colored clothing, but only naturally colored (white) clothing. Not possessing valuable, bright clothing, but only inexpensive, ordinary clothing.
2. **Auddeshikakalpa:** Not consuming food or other items that have been prepared for the purpose of another ascetic or lay person, as such food is considered to have a "proddeshik" (purposeful) fault.

4. **Rajapidakalpa:** Not consuming food or other items offered by a crowned king.
5. **Kritikarmakalpa:** Performing acts of respect and humility towards those who possess great wealth.
6. **Vratakalpa:** Observing the five great vows or the four yamas. The fourth and fifth great vows are collectively known as "Bahiddhadan" in the four yamas.
7. **Jyeshtakalpa:**  One who has received the greater initiation earlier is considered "Jyeshta" (senior). All ascetics are considered "Jyeshta" for the female ascetics. Therefore, one should behave accordingly, treating them as seniors.
8. **Pratikramanakalpa:** Performing daily, regular "Pratikraman" (self-reflection) both in the day and night.
9. **Masakalpa:** While wandering during the Hemant (winter) and Grishma (summer) seasons, one should not stay in any village or town for more than one month. After staying for one month, one should not return to that place for two months. For female ascetics, the duration is two months instead of one.
10. **Chaturmasakalpa:** During the rainy season (Varsha ritu), one should stay in the same village or town for four months and not wander. After Chaturmas, one should not stay in that village and should not return there for eight months (making it a total of twelve months after Chaturmas).

These ten Kalpas are mandatory for the ascetics of the first and last Tirthankaras. For the ascetics of the middle Tirthankaras, only four Kalpas are mandatory, while the remaining six are optional.

The four mandatory Kalpas are:

1. Shayatarapindakalpa
2. Kritikarmakalpa
3. Vratakalpa
4. Jyeshtakalpa

The six optional Kalpas are:

1. **Achel:** Possessing clothing of any type, whether inexpensive or expensive, colored or naturally colored, in any quantity as desired or as available.

[210] It is not permissible for a monk to join another *gana* (group) for the purpose of *śrutagrahaṇa* (study of scriptures) without the permission of the *ācārya* (spiritual leader), *upādhyāya* (teacher), *pravṛtaka* (preceptor), *sthavira* (elder), *gaṇī* (head of a *gana*), *gaṇadhara* (leader of a *gana*), or *gaṇāvacchedaka* (one who divides a *gana*). However, it is permissible to join another *gana* after seeking permission from the *ācārya* or *gaṇāvacchedaka*. If they grant permission, it is permissible to join another *gana*. If they do not grant permission, it is not permissible to join another *gana*. 20. If a *gaṇāvacchedaka* wishes to join another *gana* for the purpose of *śrutagrahaṇa*, it is not permissible for him to do so without relinquishing his position. It is permissible for him to join another *gana* after relinquishing his position. It is not permissible for him to join another *gana* without seeking permission from the *ācārya* or *gaṇāvacchedaka*.

[Fourfold Purpose] [211] If they give permission, it is permissible for them to accept other ganas for the purpose of receiving the scriptures. If they do not give permission, it is not permissible for them to accept other ganas for the purpose of receiving the scriptures. The meaning of this sutra is that if a sadhu wishes to accept the ordination of an acharya or upadhyaya of another gana for a short period of time for the purpose of attaining knowledge or practicing special austerities, it is necessary for him to obtain the permission of his own acharya. If the acharya is not nearby, then the permission of the upadhyaya should be obtained, in their absence the permission of the pravartaka, in their absence the permission of the sthavira, in their absence the permission of the gani, in their absence the permission of the ganadhara, and in their absence the permission of the ganavacchedaka should be obtained before going to another gana. Otherwise, he is liable to atonement. After the completion of studies, etc., the monk returns to his own gana's acharya. Because he has not gone forever. The provision for going forever is made in the following sutras. Acharyas, upadhyayas, or ganavacchedakas, etc., who hold these positions, may also go to another acharya or upadhyaya for special studies, but they can only do so after handing over their position to another qualified monk and obtaining their permission, ensuring that the order of the gachcha continues. They cannot go without permission. The reasons for handing over the position and obtaining permission are as follows: 1. Studying may take a long time. 2. Studying can only be done if one is free from the worries of the gachcha. 3. It is necessary to obtain permission for the sake of the order of the gachcha, for the sake of vinaya-pratipatti, and for the success of the work. After completing their studies, they can return to their own gachcha and resume their position. It is important to note here that a sadhu can go to another gana alone if he has the permission of the acharya, etc., but a sadhvi cannot go alone. Even if she has permission, she must go to another gana with at least one other sadhvi. The same rules apply to obtaining the permission of the acharya, etc., or following other necessary procedures. It is important to note that it is also necessary to obtain the permission of the pravarti. The method of going to another gana for sambhogika-vyavahara is as follows: 23. If a monk wishes to go to another gana for the purpose of sambhogika-vyavahara, he should be ordained in that other gana. It is not permissible for him to be ordained in another gana for the purpose of sambhogika-vyavahara without the permission of the acharya or upadhyaya or ganavacchedaka.

[212] (From the Brihatkalpasutra, if one has received the *pairiya* or the *ganavaccheiya* or any other *gana* endowed with the *sanbhogapadya*, then one should live accordingly. If one is not worthy of it, then one should not live accordingly. If one receives the *dhammavinaya* in the future, then one should live accordingly. If one does not receive the *dhammavinaya* in the future, then one should not live accordingly. 24. If one desires to be free from the *gana* in the *ganavaccheiya*, then one should not live accordingly without having renounced the *gana* endowed with the *sanbhogapadya*.

---------------------------
The fourth rule states that a monk cannot engage in *sam Bhoga* with another *gana* without first asking the *pracharaya* or *gana avchhedaka*. However, if the *pracharaya* or *gana avchhedaka* gives permission, then the monk can engage in *sam Bhoga* with another *gana*. If they do not give permission, then the monk cannot engage in *sam Bhoga* with another *gana*. If the monk believes that engaging in *sam Bhoga* with another *gana* will lead to the advancement of *dharma*, then they can engage in *sam Bhoga* with another *gana*. However, if the monk believes that engaging in *sam Bhoga* with another *gana* will not lead to the advancement of *dharma*, then they cannot engage in *sam Bhoga* with another *gana*.

The twenty-third rule states that a *gana avchhedaka* cannot engage in *sam Bhoga* with another *gana* without first relinquishing their position as *gana avchhedaka*. However, if the *gana avchhedaka* relinquishes their position, then they can engage in *sam Bhoga* with another *gana*.

[214] It is not permissible for a monk to engage in *samyog* (communal living) with another *gana* (sect) without asking the *acharya* or *gana-avchhedak* (head of the sect). However, it is permissible to engage in *samyog* with another *gana* after asking the *acharya* or *gana-avchhedak*. If they give permission, then it is permissible to engage in *samyog* with another *gana*. If they do not give permission, then it is not permissible to engage in *samyog* with another *gana*. If there is progress in the *samyama-dharma* (practice of self-restraint) in that *gana*, then it is permissible to engage in *samyog* with them. However, if there is no progress in the *samyama-dharma* in that *gana*, then it is not permissible to engage in *samyog* with them. 25. If an *acharya* or *upaadhyaya* (teacher) wishes to engage in *samyog* with another *gana* after leaving their own *gana*, then they cannot engage in *samyog* with another *gana* without relinquishing their position as *acharya* or *upaadhyaya*. However, it is permissible for them to engage in *samyog* with another *gana* after relinquishing their positions. It is not permissible for a monk to engage in *samyog* with another *gana* without asking the *acharya* or *gana-avchhedak*. However, it is permissible to engage in *samyog* with another *gana* after asking the *acharya* or *gana-avchhedak*. If they give permission, then it is permissible to engage in *samyog* with another *gana*. If they do not give permission, then it is not permissible to engage in *samyog* with another *gana*. If there is progress in the *samyama-dharma* in that *gana*, then it is permissible to engage in *samyog* with them. However, if there is no progress in the *samyama-dharma* in that *gana*, then it is not permissible to engage in *samyog* with them. Discussion: Sitting, rising, eating, drinking, and performing other daily duties together in a community of monks is called *samyog*. The *Samavayanga Sutra* (Samavay 12) lists twelve types of *samyog*, which are as follows: 1. Giving and receiving utensils such as clothes, vessels, etc. 2. Giving and receiving the recitation of scriptures. 3. Giving and receiving food, water, or medicine.

## Fourth Uddeshak:

**[215 4. Anjali-pragraha-samyama-paryaya]**

1. Standing with folded hands in front of senior monks or bowing with folded hands when meeting them.
2. Giving and receiving gifts as a disciple.
3. Inviting for a bed, robe, food, discipleship, and study.
4. **[Abhyutthana-deeksha-paryaya]** Standing up when a senior monk arrives.
5. **[Kritika-karma]** Offering respects with folded hands, circumambulation, bowing with folded hands, and chanting mantras.
6. **[Vaiyaavrutya]** Providing physical service like massage, bringing food, sewing or washing clothes, cleaning excreta, and delegating these services to other monks.
7. **[Samavasarana]** Sitting, sleeping, and engaging in activities in the same shelter.
8. **[Sannishedya]** Sitting on the same seat or offering a seat.
9. **[Katha-prabandha]** Delivering discourses together in an assembly, either sitting or standing.

These twelve types of interactions are prescribed among monks of the same gana (group). They are called "**Sam Bhogic**" monks.

Monks who engage in eleven of these interactions, excluding "**Bhakta-paan**", are called "**Any-Sam Bhogic**" monks.

They are also called "**Samanojnya**" monks because their conduct and views are similar.

These eleven or twelve types of interactions are practiced with "**Samanojnya**" monks. However, these twelve types of interactions are not practiced with "**Asamanojnya**" monks, such as those who are "**Parshvastha**" (those who have deviated from the path) or "**Svachchandaachari**" (those who act independently).

Some interactions may be practiced with them in exceptional cases, based on the judgment of the "**Geetarth**" (scriptural interpretation). There is no penance for such interactions. However, if these interactions are practiced without reason or without the guidance of "**Geetarth**", then penance is incurred.

These interactions are not practiced with householders.

With nuns, only six interactions are practiced through the "**Utsarga**" ritual, and six interactions can be practiced in exceptional circumstances.

**Utsarga Interactions** | **Exceptional Interactions**
------- | --------
Shruta (Second) | Upadhi (First)
Anjali-pragraha (Fourth) | Bhakta-paan (Third)
Shiksha-daan (Fifth) | Nimantra (Sixth)
Abhyutthana (Seventh) | Vaiyaavrutya (Ninth)
Kritika-karma (Eighth) | Samavasarana (Tenth)
Katha-prabandha (Twelfth) | Sannishedya (Eleventh)

If these twelve interactions are practiced with a householder, then the penance of "**Guru Chaumaasi**" is incurred.

Page #170:
---------------------------
[216] [Brihatkalpa Sutra] If one behaves improperly with a Svechchandaachari, a Guruchaumaasi Pratikraman is incurred, and if one behaves improperly with a Parsvastadi, a Laghuchaumaasi or Laghumaasik Pratikraman is incurred. If one behaves improperly with Sadhvis without reason, a Laghuchaumaasi Pratikraman is incurred, and if one does not follow the instructions of the Geetaarth, a Guruchaumaasi Pratikraman is incurred. / _ If one behaves with Bhakt-paan with other Sambhaugik Samanojn Bhikshus, a Laghuchaumaasi Pratikraman is incurred. The Bhashyakar has also said that in a Lok-vyavahar or an Apavadik situation, even if one does not perform the necessary actions (Anjali-pragrah, etc.) with the Parsvastadi, even then one is a participant in the Pratikraman, and by doing so, there is a lack of devotion and disgrace to the Jinshasan. / In the previous Sutraatrik, there is a statement about going to another Gachch for a short-term Upasampada for the purpose of studying, and in these Sutras, there is a description of going to another Gachch for the purpose of staying there permanently, accepting a Mandalik Aahar, etc., and Sambhog. Obtaining permission and giving the degree to another eligible Bhikshu is necessary in these Sutras as well, just as it was in the previous Sutras. In these Sutras, there is one more option even after obtaining Prajnaaprapti, as follows: "Jatthuttarayam Dhamma-vinayam Labhejjā Evam Se Kampi / Sutra-pathit" This sentence indicates that when a Sadhu sees that while staying in this Sangha, while eating and drinking in a Mandali, and while performing other Kritikarmas, there is an increase in Sanklesh instead of Bhava-vishuddhi, and due to this, his knowledge, Darshan, Charitra, etc., are not being properly cultivated, then he can go to another Gan, where there is more possibility of Dharma-labh, to protect himself from Sanklesh and to increase his knowledge, Charitra, etc., after obtaining permission from the one under whose Nishra he is staying. However, it is not permissible to go to a Gachch where there is a loss of restraint from the current state, and if one goes, the Pratikraman mentioned in Nishita U. 16 is incurred. Therefore, one should only resolve to go to a Gachch where there is an improvement in the Dharma of restraint. / The method and prohibition of going to another Gan to give a lecture to the Acharya, etc., is as follows: 26. Bhikkhu Ya Icchajja Annam Payariy-Uvajjaayam Uddisavettae, No Se Kappad Anaapuchchita Aayariyam Va Jaav Ganavchcheiyam Va Annam Payariy-Uvajjaayam Uddisavettae. Kappi Se Aapuchchita Prayariyam Va Jaav Ganavchcheiyam Va Annam Aayariy-Uvajjaayam Uddisavettae. Te Ya Se Viyarejjā Evam Se Kappi Annam Aayariy-Uvajjaayam Uddisavettae. Te Ya Se No Viyarejjā Evam Se No Kappi Annam Aayariy-Uvajshāyam Uddisavettae / No Se Kappi Teshi Karanam Adivetta Annam Aayariy-Uvajjaayam Uhissavettae. Kappi Se Teshi Karanam Diveta Annam Aayariy-Uvajjaayam Udisavettae.

## Fourth Objective] [219 It is not proper for a monk to go to another Acharya or Upadhyaya to give them a reading without a reason. But it is proper for them to go to another Acharya or Upadhyaya to give them a reading only after stating the reason. Discussion - The first Sutra-trika mentions the method of going to another gana for a certain period of time for study. The second Sutra-trika mentions the method of going to another gana for the sake of Samyama-Samadhi and Chitta-Samadhi. The third Sutra-trika mentions going to another Acharya or Upadhyaya to have them accept one's Upasampada by using the 'Uddisavitt' action.  /  In this third Sutra-trika, the option 'Jatyuttarayam Dhammavinayam Labhejj' is not present, so it does not mention going to another gana permanently. The mention of going permanently is in the second trika, and the mention of accepting Upasampada for study is in the first trika. Therefore, it is appropriate to interpret this third trika as meaning going to another gana for the purpose of teaching (etc.).  /  The last option in the Sutra is 'Kappati Tesim Karanam Diveta'. This means that it is necessary to explain the specific reason for going to teach.  /  Because if there is no specific reason, then it is not practically appropriate for the teacher to go, but it is appropriate for the student to come. Some reasons for going to teach are: 1. A newly appointed Acharya of a Gachch needs to study the scriptures and it is not possible for them to leave the burden of the Gachch to someone else. 2. A newly appointed Acharya of a Gachch is someone's son, grandson, daughter, etc., and it is not possible for them to come for study.  /  3. An Acharya of a Gachch is in a difficult or confusing situation and they are a former benefactor of a monk. In such situations, it may be necessary for someone to go. It is appropriate to understand that this third Sutra-trika is stated with this intention. The method of disposing of the body of a fallen monk 29. A monk or Rao or Viyale or Ahachch should dispose of the body, and the monk who wishes to dispose of the body should do so in a secluded place, alone or with many people.

Page #174:
---------------------------
[220] [Brihatkalpa Sutra] If a monk dies at night or during the day, and a sadhu who is a vaidya wants to perform the parithana (burial) of the deceased monk in a secluded, completely a-chitta (non-material) place, then if there is a suitable a-chitta instrument (i.e., a carrying pole) belonging to a householder, he should take it (saying that he will return it) and use it to carry the deceased monk's body to a secluded, completely a-chitta place, and then leave the carrying pole there. Discussion: If a monk dies while residing in a place where he has been observing a masakalp (monthly observance) or other such observance, it is not appropriate to keep the body in the residence or the upashraya (monastery) for a long time. As the bhashyakar (commentator) says, the body should be taken out as soon as possible after death. Therefore, if the vaidya sadhu wishes, they can take the body to a suitable place for parithana even at night. The sutra prescribes requesting a carrying instrument for the parithana. Therefore, whatever is available in the monastery or upashraya, such as a carrying pole, bamboo, or a stretcher, can be used and returned later. The body of a monk who has died a padupopagaman santhara (death due to natural causes) is not cremated. However, cremation is an option in the case of a bhaktapratyakhyan santhara (death due to rejection of food). If there is no one to perform the cremation, the sadhu should perform it according to the method described in this sutra. This is because monks cannot even conceive of the intention to perform cremation. However, if there are shravaks (lay followers) or other devout householders, they can perform some worldly actions, and the monks remain detached from them. The cremation of Tirthankaras and other monks who have attained kaladharma (liberation) is described in the Agamas. Therefore, there are two options for the final rites of a monk who has died a bhaktapratyakhyan death: 1. parithana by a sadhu, or 2. cremation by a householder. The bhashyakar has also described the directions suitable for parithana of the body. The direction south-west (nairitya kona) from the residence of the sadhus is considered auspicious for parithana. Performing parithana in this direction leads to samadhi (concentration) in the sangha (community). If a suitable place is not available in this direction, the body should be buried in the south direction. If a suitable place is not available in the south direction, the body should be buried in the south-east direction. All other directions are considered inauspicious for discarding the body. Performing parithana in those directions is said to lead to conflict, division, and disease in the sangha.

Page #175:
---------------------------
## Fourth Uddeshak [221]

If a corpse needs to be kept overnight, the monks of the Sangha should stay awake all night. To prevent any ghost or spirit from entering the corpse, they should tie both thumbs of the hands and feet with a rope, cover the mouth with a mukhavastra (muhpatti), and pierce the middle part of the finger. This is because ghosts and spirits do not enter a wounded body. 

While carrying the corpse, the feet should be placed forward. While performing the parthan (funeral rites), the muhpatti, rajoharan, and cholapattak are three essential tools. The commentary elaborates on these details. 

The Vyavahar Uddeshak 7 describes the method of performing the parthan for a monk who dies while traveling. Here, the description is for a monk who dies in the upashraya. 

**Regarding the monk who engages in conflict:**

30. If a monk engages in conflict and does not pacify it, he is not allowed to go out for food and drink from the houses of householders. He is not allowed to go out from the upashraya to the study ground or the preaching ground. He is not allowed to travel from village to village. He is not allowed to move from one gana to another or to stay for the rainy season. 

However, if he approaches his learned and knowledgeable Acharya and Upadhyaya, he can be criticized, made to perform pratikramna, be condemned, be reprimanded, be freed from sin, be purified from the fruits of sin, be committed to not committing the sin again, and accept the appropriate tapas form of atonement. 

If the atonement is given according to the scriptures, he should accept it. But if it is not given according to the scriptures, he should not accept it. If he does not accept the atonement even when it is given according to the scriptures, he should be expelled from the gana.

Page #176:
---------------------------
[222] The Brihatkalpa Sutra discusses intense kshaya and very large conflict, stating that in such a situation, the monk's mind becomes agitated, his face becomes heated, and he loses the ability to speak with discernment. Therefore, it is not appropriate for him to leave the shelter according to the instructions of the sutra. However, it is appropriate to go for gochari, etc., only after the kshaya emotions have subsided. First, it is necessary to calm the kshaya and then, after examining the situation, to approach the acharya or other knowledgeable people present there and perform alochana (atonement) to resolve the conflict. If the conflict is not resolved, he will also deviate from the path of restraint and will gradually become subject to more and more atonement. Sometimes, in the case of stubbornness and lack of calmness, atonement can be given without alochana for discipline. If, even after explanation, he does not understand and does not accept atonement or discipline, the sutra also prescribes that he should be separated from the gachchha, meaning that he should not be treated with mandalik pahara, vandana, etc. Along with the provisions for discipline, restraint, and calmness, the sutra also provides just information: if the monk accepting atonement is knowledgeable and the person giving atonement decides to give him atonement contrary to the Agamas without being impartial, then he can reject that atonement. This instruction from the sutra makes it clear that rejecting any knowledge contrary to the sutra does not constitute a violation of jina-agya, but this provision is not for those who are ignorant or not knowledgeable. The provision for vyavavritti of a monk in the parihara-kalpa state is as follows: 31. Pariharakappatthiyaassa naṃ bhikkuassa kappaï ayari-uvamāyāṇaṃ tadivasaṃ ega-girhasi piṇḍavāya davāvettāe. Teṇa paraṃ no se kappaï asanaṃ vā jāva sāimaṃ vā dāuṃ vā aṇuppadāuṃ vā kappada se annayaram veyāvaḍiyaṃ karettāe, taṃ jaha aṭṭhāvaṇaṃ vā, nisīyāvaṇaṃ vā, tuyattāvaṇaṃ vā, uccāra-pāsavaṇa-khela-jalla-siṅghāṇāṇaṃ vigičaṇaṃ vā visohanaṃ vā karettāe. Aha puṇa evaṃ jāṇejjā-chinnāvāsesu panthesu āure, jhijhīe, pivāsie, tavastī, dubale, kilate, mucchezja vā, pavadēja vā, evaṃ se kappaï asanaṃ yā jāva sāimaṃ vā dāuṃ vā aṇuppadāuṃ vā. 31. On the day he accepts parihara-tapa, it is appropriate for the acharya or upadhyaya to provide food from one house to the monk in the parihara-kalpa state.

[224] [Bahutkalpasutra 1. Ganga, 2. Jamuna, 3. Sarayu, 4. Eravati (Kosiya), 5. Mahi. It is not considered appropriate to cross these five great rivers, known for their vastness and abundant water, by swimming or by boat two or three times in a month. These rivers are: 1. Ganga, 2. Jamuna, 3. Sarayu, 4. Eravati (Kosiya), and 5. Mahi. However, if it is known that the Eravati river near Kunala city can be crossed by placing one foot in the water and one foot on land (or in the air), then it is considered appropriate to cross it two or three times in a month. If it cannot be crossed in this manner, then it is not considered appropriate to cross that river two or three times in a month. / Discussion - Rivers with continuous flow and deep water are called 'Madanadis'. In India, besides the five mentioned in the sutra, there are many other rivers like Sindhu, Brahmaputra, etc. All of them are included in the term 'Maharnava' and 'Mahanadi'. The word 'Uttaritte' used in the sutra means crossing by entering the water oneself, and the word 'Santaritie' means crossing by sitting in a boat, etc. Crossing by entering the water oneself leads to the violation of aquatic beings, and thorns, etc., present at the bottom of the river can prick the feet. Sometimes, due to the speed of the water flow, there can be self-violation as well. Crossing by boat, etc., leads to the violation of aquatic beings as well as six-bodied beings, and one has to depend on the boatman. / If the boatman demands a fee before or after crossing the river, then the problem of paying it arises, and there are many other potential problems. If there is a special reason to cross, then it should be done only once in a month, because the sutra clearly prohibits crossing by boat, etc., two or three times. For further discussion, see Nishita. Udde. 12 Sutra 44. The reference to Kunala city and the Eravati river is symbolic, therefore, wherever the Sadhus are staying for a month or a year, and there is a shallow river near that city, which can be crossed by placing one foot in the water and one foot on land (or in the air), then it is considered appropriate to cross it two or three times in a month.

Page #179:
---------------------------
## Fourth Objective] [225 If the depth of the water is such that a Sadhu can walk through it with one foot in the water and one foot above the water, then the Sadhu can cross it if there is no other safe path nearby. If the crossing requires effort, then it is necessary to perform **Kayotsarga** atonement. Due to the killing of living beings, the Sadhu also incurs **Chaturmasik** atonement according to **Nishith U. 12**.

**Regarding the rules for staying in a shelter with a thatched roof:**

**33.** A shelter made of **Tana**, **Tanapuja**, **Palala**, or **Palalpuja**, free from eggs, **Trasa** creatures, green sprouts, dew drops, insect nests, mud, flowers, and spider webs, with a roof height lower than the ears, is not suitable for **Nirgranthas** and **Nirgranthis** to stay in during the **Hemant** and **Grihsma** seasons.

**34.** A shelter made of **Tana** or **Tanapuja**, free from eggs, **Trasa** creatures, green sprouts, dew drops, insect nests, mud, flowers, and spider webs, with a roof height higher than the ears, is suitable for **Nirgranthas** and **Nirgranthis** to stay in during the **Hemant** and **Grihsma** seasons.

**35.** A shelter made of **Tana** or **Tanapuja**, free from eggs, **Trasa** creatures, green sprouts, dew drops, insect nests, mud, flowers, and spider webs, with a roof height lower than the height of a standing person's outstretched arms, is not suitable for **Nirgranthas** and **Nirgranthis** to stay in during the **Varshavas** season.

**36.** A shelter made of **Tana** or **Tanapuja**, free from eggs, **Trasa** creatures, green sprouts, dew drops, insect nests, mud, flowers, and spider webs, with a roof height higher than the height of a standing person's outstretched arms, is suitable for **Nirgranthas** and **Nirgranthis** to stay in during the **Varshavas** season.

**Discussion:**

The first rule in the above four rules states that a shelter with a roof made of dry grass, dry grain, **Palala**, straw, or other similar materials, free from eggs, **Trasa** creatures, green sprouts, dew drops, insect nests, mud, flowers, and spider webs, but with a roof height...

Page #180:
---------------------------
## Translation:

[226]  A monk or nun should not stay in a dwelling whose height is lower than the ear of a monk during the Hemant (winter) and Grishma (summer) seasons.  Another Sutra states that if the height of such a dwelling is higher than the ear of a monk, then monks and nuns can stay there during the Hemant and Grishma seasons.  

A third Sutra states that if the height of such a pure dwelling is lower than the Ratnimukuta (a crown made of jewels), then it is not appropriate for monks and nuns to spend the rainy season there.  A fourth Sutra states that if the height of the roof is higher than the Ratnimukuta, then monks and nuns can stay there during the rainy season.

The Ratnimukuta is the size of a hand.  When both hands are raised and the two palms are joined together, it forms a crown-like shape, hence it is called the Ratnimukuta.  

If a monk stands in a house with a thatched roof that is lower than the height of his ear, then particles of grass, mud, etc. will fall down repeatedly due to the touch of the grass.  Therefore, one should stay there for one or two nights during the Hemant and Grishma seasons and then move on.  During the Chaturmas (four months of the rainy season), it is necessary to stay for a long time.  During such a long period, there may be many occasions to raise one's hands.  Therefore, one can stay in a house with a thatched roof that is high enough so that the hands do not touch the grass when raised.

The reason for prohibiting staying in a dwelling with a low roof is also explained in the Bhashya (commentary).  It states that monks and nuns will have to bend down while entering and leaving such a low dwelling.  They will also not be able to stand upright inside, which will hinder them in performing Vandana (worship) and other rituals.  If they stand upright, there is a possibility of their head hitting the roof or being stung by scorpions or other creatures living above.

The word 'Alp' (less) in the Sutra-read "Appadesu Apppaanesu" etc. means 'absence'.  Staying in a dwelling with grass, seeds, or soil, etc. leads to the Chaturlaghook and Anantakaayapanak Praadi, etc.  Staying in a dwelling with Chaturghuru leads to the Chaturghuru Praayashchitta (penance).  Similarly, staying in a dwelling lower than the prescribed height also leads to the Chaturlaghoo Praayashchitta.

The Bhashyakar (commentator) has also stated that if a snake is seen residing in the grass covering of such a dwelling during the rainy season, then it should be subdued by chanting mantras.  If this is not possible, then a canopy should be built under the grass covering.  If this is also not possible, then a bamboo mat should be placed above.  This will prevent the snake from hanging down and biting from above.  If it is not possible to place a mat, then the monks staying there should use a Chilmilika (a kind of mosquito net).

All the above statements apply to dwellings or residences that are made of or covered with grass, straw, etc., or have grass, etc. placed on the top.  However, there is no prohibition on staying in a house made of stone, etc.  However, it is advisable to stay in a house with a suitable height, as it is conducive to restraint and good health.

The fourth [**uddeshaka**] is the [**samadhikaraka**] for 227. Therefore, one should stay in a house with a suitable height ceiling, if possible. The summary of the fourth [**uddeshaka**] is that the [**sutras**] 1 [**hastakarma**, **maithunasevan** and **ratribhojan**] receive [**anudghatik prayaschitta**]. It receives [**paranchik prayaschitta**] for consuming three types of [**dosha**]. It receives [**anavasthapy prayaschitta**] for consuming three types of [**dosha**]. It is not permissible to initiate, ordain or appoint three types of eunuchs. It is not appropriate to give [**vachana**] to those with 10-11 [**avaguna**], but it is appropriate to give [**vachana**] to those with three [**guna**]. It is difficult to understand three types of people and easy to understand three types of people. If a monk experiences pleasure with the intention of serving, by touching etc., he receives [**prayaschitta**] for the violation of the fourth [**vrat**]. Food and water taken in the first [**prahar**] should not be kept in the fourth [**prahar**]. Food and water should not be taken beyond two [**kos**]. Do not eat inedible food etc. taken from [**anabhoga**], but a newly ordained monk can eat it. It is not permissible for the monks of the first and last [**tirthankara**] to take any [**prauddeshik aahar**], but it is permissible for the monks of other [**tirthankara**]. Any monk or graduate can go to study in another [**gana**], to change [**gana**] and to study, after taking permission from the [**pracharaya**] etc. and following the [**sutras**]. The [**kaladharmaprapta bhikku**] can be taken outside the village to a secluded place by his [**sarmic sadhu**] with the [**pratiharik upakaran**]. The monk should not go to [**gochari**] etc. without calming the [**klesha**]. Upon calming the [**klesha**], one should give and take appropriate [**prayaschitta**]. The [**pracharaya**] should take the one who is carrying out [**parihara tapa**] with him and give him [**gochari**] for one day, and later, if necessary, he can perform [**vaiavritta**] etc. One should not cross rivers with strong currents more than once a month, but rivers with water flow up to the thighs can be crossed many times a month according to the [**sutras**]. 20-28

Discussion The meaning of this sutra is that if a monk goes to another gana due to anger for some reason, then the elders of that gana should pacify him by giving him advice and send him back to his former gana after giving him a five-day initiation break. This will make the nirgrantha monks of that gana believe that the anger of this nirgrantha monk has now subsided. If the Upadhyaya goes to another gana due to anger for some reason, then the elders of that gana should pacify him with gentle words and return him to his former gana after giving him a ten-day initiation break. If the Acharya etc. also go to another gana due to anger, then the elders of that gana should pacify them with gentle words and return them to their former gana after giving them a fifteen-day initiation break. While explaining the widespread effect of kshaya, the commentator said that the character that has been earned by performing penance for crores of years in the past is destroyed by the kshaya done for even a moment. Therefore, a nirgrantha monk should not have kshaya. If kshaya arises by chance, then one should try to pacify it immediately. If a monk etc. who has come to another gana after leaving his own gana does not want to go back to his own gana even after being explained, then the elders of that gana can keep him in their gana after giving a ten-day initiation break to a common monk, a fifteen-day initiation break to an Upadhyaya, and a twenty-day initiation break to an Acharya, but before keeping him, if possible, information and permission should be obtained from his gana. Discussion and atonement provision for excess in night meal 6. If a monk, being greedy, wants to eat more than his quota, he should not accept food until the next day, or he should accept food only as much as he can eat. If he eats more than that, he should know that...

## Translation:

**232] [Brihatkalpa Sutra 7.** A monk who has vowed to beg for alms between sunrise and sunset, but is uncertain about the time of sunrise or sunset, and is eating while still able to taste, if he learns that sunrise has not occurred or sunset has already occurred, then he should spit out the food that is in his mouth, hand, or bowl, and cleanse his mouth and other parts. He will not have transgressed the Jina's command. If he eats that food himself or gives it to another non-Jain, then he will be guilty of eating at night, and therefore he will be liable for the Anudghatik Chaturmasik Pratikraman. 

**8.** A monk who has vowed to beg for alms between sunrise and sunset, and is certain about the time of sunrise or sunset, and is eating while still able to taste, if he learns that sunrise has not occurred or sunset has already occurred, then he should spit out the food that is in his mouth, hand, or bowl, and cleanse his mouth and other parts. He will not have transgressed the Jina's command. If he eats that food himself or gives it to another non-Jain, then he will be guilty of eating at night, and therefore he will be liable for the Anudghatik Chaturmasik Pratikraman. 

**9.** A monk who has vowed to beg for alms between sunrise and sunset, but is uncertain about the time of sunrise or sunset, and is eating while still able to taste, if he learns that sunrise has not occurred or sunset has already occurred, then he should spit out the food that is in his mouth, hand, or bowl, and cleanse his mouth and other parts. He will not have transgressed the Jina's command. If he eats that food himself or gives it to another non-Jain, then he will be guilty of eating at night, and therefore he will be liable for the Anudghatik Chaturmasik Pratikraman. 

**Discussion:** These four sutras are spoken with respect to four types of monks: 

* The first sutra is for a **Samstṛta** and **Nivicikitsa** monk.
* The second sutra is for a **Samstṛta** and **Vicikitsa** monk.
* The third sutra is for an **Asamstṛta** and **Nivicikitsa** monk.
* The fourth sutra is for an **Asamstṛta** and **Vicikitsa** monk.

**Samstṛta** means strong, healthy, and able to eat enough every day. 
**Asamstṛta** means weak, unhealthy, and practicing austerities like fasting. 

There are three types of **Asamstṛta** monks:

1. **Tap-Asamstṛta:** A monk who has become weak due to practicing austerities.
2. **Glan-Prasamstṛta:** A monk who has become weak due to illness.
3. **Adhvan-Prasamstṛta:** A monk who has become tired due to travel.

The fifth objective [233 The term *vichchikits* means a monk who is doubtful whether sunrise has occurred or not, or whether sunset has occurred or not / *nivitchikits* means a monk who is certain, i.e., 'sunrise has occurred' or 'sunset has not occurred' - a *nirgranth* with such certainty / *nirgranth-nirgranthis* may travel with merchants for self-protection while passing through large forest areas between countries / the merchant may stop and stay wherever sunset occurs / he may proceed as soon as sunrise occurs / sometimes merchants coming from opposite directions may also stay together at such stops / at that time, if the sun is not visible in the cloudy sky, there may be a misconception of sunrise, and the merchant may depart for the next journey, then if a new merchant wants to give food to the *nirgranth* or *nirgranthi*, it is possible to accept food etc. with the belief that 'sunrise has occurred', and it is also possible to consume it / at that time, if the clouds clear and the morning glow appears or the sunrise is seen, then the *nirgranth* or *nirgranthi* should return the food / otherwise, he becomes liable for the atonement mentioned in the scriptures. See other discussions in *Nishith* U. 10, Sutra 28 / there also, these four sutras are mentioned in the same way.  Discussion regarding *udgal* and atonement rules 10. If a *nirgranth* or *nirgranthi* receives *udgal* at night or during the twilight (sandhya) with water and food, then if he spits it out and cleanses his mouth, there is no transgression of the *jina* command / if he swallows the *udgal*, he is considered to have committed the sin of eating food at night, and he becomes liable for the *anudghatik* four-month atonement. Discussion: Whenever a monk eats or drinks more than the prescribed amount, he experiences *udgal*, and the food and drink from his stomach comes back to his mouth / therefore, the advice of the gurus is that a monk should always eat and drink less than the prescribed amount. If a monk happens to eat or drink more than the prescribed amount and experiences *udgal* at night or in the evening, then he should cleanse his mouth with cloth etc. according to the prescribed method / whoever swallows the *udgal* that comes out, becomes liable for the atonement mentioned in the scriptures. To clarify this matter, the commentator has given an allegory.

---------------------------
[234] Just as when less than the required amount of milk or other liquid is put into a frying pan, it boils and cooks within the pan and does not overflow, but when the pan is filled to the brim with milk or any other substance, it boils over and overflows from the pan, sometimes even extinguishing the fire of the stove. Similarly, when one consumes food beyond the limit, it causes indigestion, and when one consumes less food, it does not cause indigestion. / This is also mentioned in the Prāyaścitta Sūtra, Niśītha U. 10. The rules for eating and discarding contaminated food are as follows: 11. If any living being, seed, or sentient dust falls into the bowl of a monk who has entered a householder's house for food and water, and if it can be separated and purified, then it should be separated and purified first, and then eaten or drunk with care. / If it is not possible to separate or purify it, then it should not be consumed by oneself or given to others, but should be discarded in a secluded and clean place after being carefully cleaned and washed. When a monk or nun goes out for alms, they should first inspect the food offered by the person who gives it to them to see if it is pure or not. Are there any living beings in it? If it appears pure and free from living beings, then it should be accepted, otherwise not. / After accepting the food with care, either by seeing or by examining it, one should again check the bowl to see if any flies or other insects have fallen into it while the food was being given, or if any other insects have crawled onto it. If a monk or nun does not take such precautions, they are liable to the Prāyaścitta of the Lahu-māsa. If, while the householder is giving food, the monk's attention is diverted elsewhere, and as soon as he leaves the householder's house, he remembers that he did not inspect the bowl for living beings, then he should stop at some place within seven steps and inspect it. If the monastery is nearby, he should go there and inspect it. If any living beings are found moving about, they should be carefully removed one by one. / Similarly, if any dead creatures, sentient seeds, or food mixed with sentient leaves are found in the food, and if they can be removed, they should be removed with discretion. If they cannot be removed, then the food should be discarded in a secluded, lifeless place.

Page #189:
---------------------------
[235 Fifth Uddeshak] The commentator has also said that while partaking food, the sadhu should also be mindful that the householder from whose place the food has been brought is not watching? It should be partaken while hidden from his eyes / Otherwise, he will criticize saying, "Look how these sadhus are insane, who even after receiving such rare food, throw it away." The meaning of this sutra is that if any sentient substance or sentient-mixed food is taken carelessly and the sentient substance can be purified, then it can be eaten after purification. If the sentient substance is so mixed that it is not possible to remove it, then that mixed food should also be partaken. For example: 1. Onion pieces in curd, 2. Salt in sugar, 3. Poppy seeds etc. fallen in dry cold churma etc., 4. It is less possible to remove insects etc. from ghevar or feeni etc., and food contaminated with phulan and rasaj jivas cannot be purified, therefore these are fit for partaking / The rule for eating and partaking food on which sentient water drops have fallen is 12. Nigganthassa ya gahavaikulam pindavayapadiae anuppavitthassa anto padiggahansi dae va, dagarae ba, dagaphuse va pariavajjezza se ya usinabhoyajaae paribhottabve sia. Se ya siyabhoyajaae tan no appana bhujezza, no agnessi vaave, egate bahufasueae thandile padilheita pamjjitta parittabveyadhve sia / 12. If sentient water, water drops or water particles fall into the vessel of a sadhu who has entered the householder's house for food and water, and that food is hot, then it should be eaten. _ If that food is cold, then neither should it be eaten by oneself nor given to others, but it should be partaken in a secluded and spacious place / Discussion - The previous sutra states the law regarding contaminated food, and the present sutra states that if sentient water or water drops or fine sprinkles fall on food taken due to rain or someone else's carelessness, then the bhikshu should know whether that food is hot or cold? If it is hot, then the water drops become non-sentient, so that food can be eaten / Such as khichdi, milk, dal etc. hot items / If the food taken is cold, then it should not be eaten, but should be partaken, such as khakhra roti etc. / In the commentary-gatha. 5910-5912 of this sutra, while explaining, the alternatives (bhang) of the quantity of cold food and touch etc. have been given, and the conditions of the fallen water drops etc. becoming weaponized or not from the food have been explained. Their summary is - 'Vyakhyato Visheshpratipatti:' Therefore, the quantity of water and the quantity of cold or hot food and the conditions of touch etc.

Page #190:
---------------------------
[Brihatkalpasūtra Anupāta] According to the Brihatkalpasūtra, one should determine on one's own that the water is acittaja (devoid of consciousness) and if it is acittaja, one should consume the food, and if it is sacittaja (with consciousness), one should offer it. The Āgamas have stated that the water containing parts of various food items is acittaja and acceptable. Therefore, there is a high possibility that the drops of water falling on the cold food become acittaja. Just as the hot food can be consumed, similarly, the cold food can also be consumed over time without any fault. The immediate acittaja state of the water drops in the hot food is certain, while the acittaja state of the water drops falling on the cold food is uncertain or becomes acittaja over time. This is the reason for the difference in the provisions for both in the sūtra.

[Prāyaścitta] 13. If a Nirgrantha woman, while urinating or defecating at night or in the afternoon, is touched by any part of the body of an animal or bird, and she approves of that touch with a sexual feeling, she incurs the fault of hāthakamma (manual activity) and becomes eligible for the anugghāiya (non-obstructive) monthly prāyaścitta.

14. If a Nirgrantha woman, while urinating or defecating at night or in the afternoon, is penetrated by any part of the body of an animal or bird, and she approves of that penetration with a sexual feeling, she incurs the fault of mehuṇapaḍisevvaṇa (sexual intercourse) and becomes eligible for the anugghāiya (non-obstructive) four-monthly prāyaścitta.

These two sūtras are stated for the protection of the vow of brahmacarya (celibacy). If a sādhvī (female ascetic) is urinating or defecating at night or in the evening, and a monkey, deer, dog, or a peacock, swan, etc. suddenly touches any part of her body, and she experiences that touch as pleasurable, she becomes eligible for the guru-māsika (major monthly) prāyaścitta. If any part of the aforementioned animals or birds enters her genital region, and she experiences sexual pleasure, she becomes eligible for the guru-cāturmāsika (major four-monthly) prāyaścitta for her purification.

---------------------------
[237th Uddeshaka] The commentator writes that in places where there is a lot of movement of monkeys and other animals, the sadhvis should not go alone to excrete urine and feces. If they have to go, they should go with another sadhvi holding a danda (staff) so that the animals can be warded off when they come near. Even during the day, the sadhvis should go to excrete holding a danda.

15. It is not proper for a solitary nirgrantha (Jain nun) to go out or enter the house of a householder for alms.
16. It is not proper for a solitary nirgrantha to go out or enter the place of defecation or the place of study.
17. It is not proper for a solitary nirgrantha to go from one village to another village, or to stay in a monsoon retreat.

Explanation - It is not appropriate for a nirgrantha (Jain nun) to stay or move around alone at any place, because there is a possibility of attack and assault by immoral people if a woman is seen alone. For the same reason, she should not go alone even to a householder's house for alms. The place outside the village for excretion is called 'vicarabhumi' and the quiet place for study is called 'viharabhumi'. Going alone to these lands, wandering from one village to another, and staying alone at any place during the monsoon retreat are also prohibited for the sadhvi.

18. It is not proper for a nirgrantha to be without clothes.
19. It is not proper for a nirgrantha to be without footwear.

---------------------------
238) For a Sadhvi, being Achel and Jinkalpi is also prohibited. Although it is prescribed to be Achel in the religion of the omniscient, it is completely prohibited for a Sadhvi to be without clothes due to many reasons like public opinion, male attraction, etc. / It is not possible for a Sadhvi to do Ahar-Nihar without having the qualifications of Bhakta-Panadi. It is also prohibited for a Sadhvi to abandon clothes and do Kayotsarga, because in that state, there is a possibility of Upasargadi by young men motivated by lust. A Sadhvi is prohibited from doing Asanadi with a vow. 20. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to be in Vosattkaya. 21. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to stand outside a village or capital, with arms raised, facing the sun, with one leg, and to take a nap.  It is proper to take a nap with the body relaxed, with the arms hanging down, with the legs straight, and with the body relaxed. 22. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to be in Thanaiya. 23. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to be in Padimatthaya. 24. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to be in Ukkudyasaniya. 25. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to be in Nisajjiya. 26. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to be in Viraasaniya. 27. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to be in Dandasanaiya. / 28. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to be in Lagandasaiya. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to be in Omanthiya. 30. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to be in Uttaniya. 31. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to be in Ambakhujjiya. 32. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to be in Egapasaiya. / 20. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to completely cover the body. / 21. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to stand outside a village or capital, with arms raised, facing the sun, with one leg, and to take a nap.

Fifth Objective [239 But it is proper to take sunbath inside the Upashraya by hanging the arms down, keeping both legs flat and standing with a curtain inside / 22. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to take up Kayotsarga while standing. 23. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to take up Kayotsarga for one night or more. 24. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to take up the posture of Utkuta Asana. 25. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to take up the posture of Nishadya. / 26. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to take up the posture of Vira Asana. / 27. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to take up the posture of Danda Asana. / 28.

It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to take up the posture of Uttana Asana. / 31. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to take up the posture of Amra-Kubjika Asana. / 32. It is not proper for a Nirgranthi to take up the posture of sleeping on one side. Discussion: It is forbidden for a Sadhvi to endure any kind of affliction related to the body, whether it be human, animal or divine. / / If a Sadhvi wants to take a sunbath, she can do so inside her Upashraya according to the method mentioned in the scriptures, without going outside the village or other places. It is also forbidden for a Sadhvi to stand for a long time with a fixed time for Kayotsarga. The 12 Pratimas, Moyapadimas, etc., which are performed alone, are also forbidden for a Sadhvi. It is also forbidden for a Sadhvi to sit in five types of Nishadya Asana for a fixed time. The five types of Nishadya are as follows: 1. Samapada-puta - in which both feet touch the puta part, 2. Go-Nishadya - sitting like a cow. 3. Hastishundika - sitting on both putas, raising one leg like an elephant's trunk. 4. Paryanka - sitting in Padmasana and 5. Ardha-Paryanka - half Padmasana, i.e. sitting with one leg on top of the other. Sadhvis are forbidden from taking up these five types of Nishadya.

Page #194:
---------------------------
[240] The text from Sutras 26 to 33 of the Brihatkalpa Sutra states that it is forbidden for a Sadhvi to perform the mentioned asanas at a fixed time. The nature of these asanas is described in Dasha. Dasha. 7, from where it can be understood. The commentator has explained the reason for prohibiting all these practices as there is a possibility of upsarga (adverse effects) etc. by young men who are motivated by lust. She cannot be careful and alert before the fixed time is over. If a Sadhvi stands, sits or sleeps in any posture without a fixed time, then it is not prohibited in these Sutras. The commentary also states: "Birasana Godohi Muttusamve Vi Tana Kampati / Te Pun Paducch Chettha, Suttha U Abhiggaham Pappa // 5956 //" Except for Virasana and Goduhikasana, all asanas are considered appropriate for a Sadhvi according to her inclination. The prohibition mentioned in the Sutras is with respect to Abhiggaha. Virasana and Goduhikasana are not suitable for a woman's physical state, which is why the commentator has prohibited them. Although Abhiggaha etc. practices are special places for Nirjara, they are prohibited for Sadhvis because they hinder the protection of the Mahavrat of Brahmacharya. The commentary explains this topic in detail and also prohibits the Agit-artha Bhikshutras from wearing these Abhiggahas. The rules regarding wearing the Akucanapattak are as follows: 33. No Kappi Nigganthinam Akucanapattagandharitte Va, Pariharitte Va. 34. Kappi Nigganthanam Akucanapattagandharitte Va, Pariharitte Va. 33. It is not appropriate for Nirgranthis to keep or use the Akucanapattak. 34. It is appropriate for Nirgranthis to keep or use the Akucanapattak. Discussion: The other name for 'Akucanapattak' is 'Paryastikapattak'. It is a cotton cloth four fingers wide and as long as the body. It is used when there is no support like a wall etc. Where there is a possibility of Udai etc. creatures on the wall etc. and it is necessary for the elderly, weak etc. to sit leaning on something, then by tying the waist with this Paryastikapattak and raising the knees and tying the legs, a comfortable chair-like position is achieved and the body gets comfort similar to leaning on a wall.

Page #195:
---------------------------
The fifth objective [Sitting with a Paryastika pattak (a cushion) is considered a proud posture. For a Sadhvi, sitting in this way is considered inappropriate due to her body structure, therefore, the Sutra prohibits the use of Paryastika pattak for her. The Bhashyakar has explained that in case of extreme necessity, a Sadhvi should use her discretion to sit with a Paryastika pattak and cover it with a cloth. A Sadhu should also generally avoid using a Paryastika pattak, as it is a supplementary tool to be used in special circumstances. The rules and prohibitions of using a supported seat are as follows: 35. Nigganthi should not sit or sleep on a supported seat. 36. Niggantha can sit or sleep on a supported seat. Discussion: The above Sutras mention the use of Paryastika pattak for support, and these Sutras describe supported chairs and other seats. A monk can use these tools if necessary. If these are not available, a Paryastika pattak can be used. Monks who always need a Paryastika pattak can keep one with them, as chairs and other tools are not available in all areas. Due to the aforementioned reasons, Sadhvis are prohibited from using these supported seats. If a Sadhu or Sadhvi finds it necessary to use a chair or other tool in a general setting, they can use it with discretion without relying on support. The rules and prohibitions of using a Savisaan Peeth (a wooden platform for sitting) are as follows: 37. Sadhvis should not sit or sleep on a Savisaan Peeth (a wooden platform for sitting) or a Falak (a golden slab). 38. Sadhus can sit or sleep on a Savisaan Peeth or a Falak. Discussion: A Peetha or Falak has small, raised pillars like horns. They are round and smooth, making them appear like male symbols. Therefore, it is prohibited for a Sadhvi to use them.

---------------------------
[242] [The Brihatkalpa Sutra states / If a sadhu has access to other types of foot-rests, they should not use those with spikes. This is because if they are not careful, they could trip and fall or get injured, and if they are sharp, they could puncture the skin. / The rules regarding the use of a Tumbe-patra with a stalk are as follows: 39. It is not permissible for a sadhvi to keep or use a Tumbe-patra with a stalk. 40. It is permissible for a sadhu to keep or use a Tumbe-patra with a stalk. Explanation: These sutras state that a sadhvi should not keep a Tumbe-patra with a stalk. / The reason for this is that it should be considered similar to a foot-rest with spikes (in terms of its potential to hinder celibacy). / There is no objection to a sadhu keeping such a Tumbe-patra. The rules regarding the use of a Patrakesarika with a stalk are as follows: 41. It is not permissible for a sadhvi to keep or use a Patrakesarika with a stalk. 42. It is permissible for a sadhu to keep or use a Patrakesarika with a stalk. / Explanation: A 'Patrakesarika' is a tool used to wipe or clean the inside of a vessel or Tumbe-patra, made by tying a piece of cloth to one end of a wooden stick. The prohibition against a sadhvi keeping this tool is based on the potential for it to hinder celibacy. She can use other types of Patrakesarika, such as those with a round stick, or those without a stick, just like she can use a cleaning tool without a stick. The rules regarding the use of a foot-rest with a wooden stick are as follows: 43. It is not permissible for a nirgranthi to keep or use a foot-rest with a wooden stick. 44. It is permissible for a sadhu to keep or use a foot-rest with a wooden stick. /

---------------------------
## Fifth Objective] [243 44. It is not permissible for a Niggrantha to keep or use a 'Padaponchhan' with a wooden stick. Discussion- The Padaponchhan instrument of the Vastra Khand is used to wipe off dust from the feet, etc. / Its different uses are described in the Pagam. Here, due to the aforementioned reasons, the use of a Padaponchhan with a wooden stick is prohibited for a Sadhvi, and a Sadhu can keep a Padaponchhan with a stick if necessary / Other information related to this instrument is given in the discussion of Nishita U. 2 Sutra 1. Mutual exchange of urine method-prohibition 45. It is not permissible for Niggranthas or Niggranthis to drink each other's urine or massage with it, except in severe illness and terror / 45. It is not permissible for Niggranthas and Niggranthis to drink each other's urine or massage with it, except in severe illness and terror / Discussion- Although urine is not drinkable, yet on the advice of a physician, in difficult-to-treat diseases like blood disorders, leprosy, etc., or in case of snakebite or terror that can quickly cause death, Sadhus and Sadhvis are allowed to drink urine, and in case of swelling, etc., they are allowed to massage with it, as per the present Sutra / In many diseases, the use of cow, goat, etc., urine and in many diseases, the use of one's own urine is prescribed in medical science. Due to these reasons, there may be a situation where a Sadhu-Sadhvi may have to exchange urine with each other. The Sutra has been laid down in this regard, and in normal circumstances, mutual exchange is also prohibited. The meaning of Achaman is also to purify, but here, due to the strong provision related to severe illness, the meaning of massage is relevant. Method-prohibition of keeping food-medicine contaminated 46. It is not permissible for Niggranthas or Niggranthis to eat food that has been kept overnight, even if it is the size of a skin, even if it is the size of the earth, even if it is the size of a drop, except in severe illness and terror / 47. It is not permissible for Niggranthas or Niggranthis to apply or smear their body with anything that has been contaminated, except in severe illness and terror / 48. It is not permissible for Niggranthas or Niggranthis to apply or smear their body with oil or ghee that has been contaminated, except in severe illness and terror / 46.

Discussion: It is strictly forbidden for Jains to accumulate food and drink, or to apply ointments, at night, and there is a penance for doing so. This is because such actions violate the principles of non-violence. The commentary provides a detailed explanation of this topic. In cases of severe illness or fear, it is permissible to accumulate the aforementioned essential items, to keep them overnight, and to use them. If one knows that a severe illness or fear is imminent, such as a pandemic or an invasion, and the village is being evacuated, or if a monk is ill and unable to walk, and the necessary medicines are not available in nearby villages and have to be brought from far away, then one can accumulate these items, keep them overnight, and use them. Sandalwood, nutmeg, and ginger are examples of substances that can be used as ointments. They are prepared by grinding or crushing them on a stone.  *Mālepan* refers to applying an ointment once, *vilepan* refers to applying it repeatedly, and *ālepan* refers to applying it all over the body in case of burning sensation. *Vilepan* refers to applying an ointment to a specific part of the body, such as the head. Jains should not use any kind of ointment for beautification. They can only use ointments for the relief of illness. In cases of severe illness or fear, these substances can be kept overnight. These sutras allow for the consumption and use of substances kept overnight in exceptional circumstances. This should not be understood as allowing for the consumption of food or the use of substances at night, but rather as allowing for the use of substances kept overnight during the day. The sutras should be understood as allowing for the keeping of rare substances overnight and their use during the day in cases of severe illness or fear. The commentary explains how to keep different substances overnight and how to use them.

## Fifth Objective | 245. The Fault of a Pariharak Bhikshu and Its Atonement

49. If a Pariharak Bhikshu goes out for a Vyavavritti (a period of retreat) to the Theras, and by chance commits a fault while in the Pariharakalp (period of austerity), and the Thera learns of this through his own knowledge or from others, then after the Vyavavritti, he should be given a very small Prasthapana (atonement).

**Explanation:** The word "Vyavavritti" in this sutra is an example of Upalakshana (a word used to denote something else), therefore other necessary tasks are also included in it. If the Acharya (teacher) or the head of the Gan (group) sends a Pariharatap (one who is undergoing austerity) for Vyavavritti or to debate with the followers of other philosophies, or if he himself goes elsewhere for some unavoidable reason, and there he transgresses the limits of his Pariharatap, then the Acharya, etc., should know about this transgression through his own knowledge or from someone else and give him a very small atonement. This is because his Pariharatap was interrupted due to special reasons like Vyavavritti or debate, etc. In such situations, if necessary, the Acharya can also release him from his Pariharatap. Therefore, the transgression committed during that period is considered forgivable and a very small Prasthapana atonement is given.

## The Law of Going to a Gochari (a place of retreat) After Accepting Pulak-Bhakta (a very delicious meal)

50. If a Nigganthi (Jain monk) enters a householder's house for food and accepts Pulak-Bhakta (a very delicious meal) there, and if he is able to sustain himself with that meal, then he should stay on that food for that day, but he should not go to the householder's house for food again. If he is not able to sustain himself with that meal, then it is permissible for him to go to the householder's house for food again.

**Explanation:** The word "Pulak" generally means "unsubstantial food," but here it has a special meaning...

Page #200:
---------------------------
This Kalpasutra states that any food that causes a loss of restraint or disrespect or criticism of the Jain religion, the Sangha, or the Dharma is called Pulak-Bhakta. The commentary explains that Pulak-Bhakta is of three types: 1. Dhanya Pulak, 2. Gandha Pulak, 3. Rasa Pulak. 1. Grains like Sanwa, Sali, and Ball, which do not increase physical strength, are called 'Dhanya Pulak'. 2. Garlic, onion, cloves, cardamom, and perfumes with strong odors are called 'Gandha Pulak'. 3. Milk, tamarind juice, grape juice, and other highly nutritious, flavorful, and chemically-mixed foods are called 'Rasa Pulak'. This Sutra prohibits a Sadhvi from going out for alms again if she can sustain herself on 'Pulak-Bhakta'. Therefore, the Sutra should be understood in the context of 'Rasa Pulak'. The Sutra's prohibition on going out for alms again in the case of 'Gandha Pulak' and 'Dhanya Pulak' is not logical. 'Rasa Pulak' often causes indigestion or madness. Therefore, if a Sadhvi can sustain herself on it, she should not go out for alms to avoid these potential problems. If the 'Rasa Pulak' is in small quantities and cannot sustain her, she can go out for alms again. This Sutra applies to Nirgranthi. Why not to Nirgranth? The commentator answers: "Eseva gamo niyama tivihpulagammi hoi samanaanam" - the rule that applies to Nirgranthi also applies to Nirgranth. The summary of the fifth Uddeshak is: If a man or woman, disguised as a Sadhu or Sadhvi, embraces a Sadhu or Sadhvi and they experience sexual desire from the touch, they incur Guruchaumasi Pratikraman. If a monk from another gana comes to you in distress, you should pacify him and give him a Dikshached Pratikraman for five days and send him back to his gana. If you realize that the sun has set or has not risen after eating or while eating, you should spit out the food. If you eat it, you incur Guruchaumasi Pratikraman. If you have a bad taste in your mouth at night, you should spit it out and not swallow it.

Page #201:
---------------------------
## Fifth Uddeshak:

**Sutras 11, 12, 13-14, 15-17, 18-21, 22-32:**

* If a **saccitta** seed, **raj** or **tras** creature enters the food while **gochari**, it should be carefully removed. If it cannot be removed, then that much contaminated food should be discarded.
* If **saccitta** water drops fall into the food while **gochari**, hot food can be eaten, but cold food should be discarded.
* If an animal or bird touches or enters the genitals of a **nirgranthi** while she is excreting at night, and the **nirgranthi** approves of it with **maithunabhav**, then she incurs **guruchaumasi** penance.
* A **nirgranthi** should not go alone for **gochari**, **sthandil** or **svadhyaya**, and should not wander or observe **chaturmas** alone.
* A **nirgranthi** should not be without clothes, free from sin, keep her body **vosira**, or take **atapan** outside the village. However, she can take **atapan** in the **upashraya** according to the prescribed method.
* A **nirgranthi** should not be bound by any kind of **asana** by vow.
* **Aakuchana patta**, **palamban**-equipped **asana**, small **stambha**-equipped **pidhe**, **nal**-equipped **tumba**, **kasthadanda**-equipped **patrakesarika** or **padaphochana** are not allowed for a **sadhvi**, but a **sadhu** can use them.
* Without a strong reason, **sadhu** and **sadhvi** cannot use each other's urine for drinking or rinsing.
* **Sadhu** and **sadhvi** cannot use food, water, medicine, and **lepya** substances kept overnight without a strong reason. However, they can use these substances during the day with a strong reason.
* If a **bhikshu** carrying **parihara tap** goes for service and violates any of his **maryada**, he should perform a very small penance after returning from the service.
* After getting very nutritious food, a **sadhvi** should not search for other food. However, if she cannot survive on that food, and it is in very small quantity, she can go for **gochari** again.

**Conclusion:**

This **uddeshak** contains 45 **sutras**. **Sutras 1-4** and **13-14** deal with the penance for **maithunabhav**, and the duty towards a **bhikshu** who has come after suffering.

## Sixth Uddeshak: Prohibition of Unthinkable Speech

1. **It is not befitting for Nigganthas or Nigganthis to utter these six types of speech:** 
    1. **Alikavacana:** False or deceitful speech.
    2. **Holitavacana:** Speech that insults or belittles others.
    3. **Khisitavacana:** Speech that is angry or provokes anger.
    4. **Parushavacana:** Harsh, rough, or cruel speech.
    5. **Garhasthyavacana:** Addressing family members by their familial names like father, son, uncle, etc.
    6. **Vinosaviyam:** Rekindling conflict by repeating words that cause strife, even after reconciliation.

**Explanation:**

1. **Alikavacana:** False or deceitful speech is considered "Alikavacana."
2. **Holitavacana:** Speech that belittles or insults others is considered "Holitavacana."
3. **Khisitavacana:** Speech that is angry or provokes anger is considered "Khisitavacana."
4. **Parushavacana:** Harsh, rough, or cruel speech is considered "Parushavacana."
5. **Garhasthyavacana:** Addressing family members by their familial names like father, son, uncle, etc. is considered "Garhasthyavacana."
6. **Vinosaviyam:** Rekindling conflict by repeating words that cause strife, even after reconciliation, is considered "Vinosaviyam."

**Sadhus and Sadhvis should avoid these six types of speech.**

**The same atonement applies to those who falsely accuse others:**

2. **There are six specific types of atonement for transgressions, as follows:**
    1. **Paṇāivairasa:** Violence against a living being.
    2. **Musāvāya:** Lying.
    3. **Pradiṇṇādāṇassa:** Accepting a gift that was not given freely.
    4. **Aviraiva:** Stealing.
    5. **Aparisavā:** Sexual misconduct.
    6. **Vāsavā:** Indulging in worldly pleasures.

**These six types of atonement should be performed until the transgression is fully atoned for, and the individual attains the state of Tatthāṇapatta.**

Page #204:
---------------------------
[250] 1. When accused of *Prāṇātipāta*, 2. When accused of *Mṛṣāvāda*, 3. When accused of *Adattādāna*, 4. When accused of violating *Brahmacarya*, 5. When accused of being *Napumsaka*, 6. When accused of being a *Dāsa*. A *Sādhu* who does not prove someone innocent by accusing them of these specific *Prāyaścitta* places, becomes a partaker of that very *Prāyaścitta* place. Discussion - 1. The conduct of the *Kalpa-nirgrantha*, 2. *Prastāra* - specific *Prāyaścitta* places, 3. Accusing someone of having taken *Prastaraṇa Prāyaścitta* - *Sevana*.  /  The sūtra mentions six *Prastāra* - First *Prastāra* - If a *Nirgrantha* in the presence of the *Ācārya* etc. says about another *Nirgrantha*, "Such and such *Nirgrantha* has killed such and such *Trasa* being." The *Ācārya* etc. hearing his statement, should call the *Nirgrantha* related to the accusation and ask him, "Did you kill a *Trasa* being?" If he says, "I did not kill any being." In such a situation, the *Nirgrantha* who made the accusation should be asked to prove his statement. If the accuser proves the accusation, then the one who is accused of killing a being, is eligible for *Prāyaścitta* according to the fault. If the accuser cannot prove the accusation, then he becomes a partaker of the *Prāyaścitta* given for committing *Prāṇātipāta*. Similarly, the second *Prastāra* should be understood in relation to the accusation of *Mṛṣāvāda*, the third *Prastāra* in relation to the accusation of *Adattādāna*, and the fourth *Prastāra* in relation to the accusation of *Avirativāda* - violation of *Brahmacarya*.  /  Accusing a *Nirgrantha* of being *Napumsaka* in front of the *Ācārya* etc. who gave the initiation, is the fifth *Prastāra* ' *Apuṣuṣavāda*'. Accusing a *Nirgrantha* of being "a slave or a son of a slave", is the sixth *Prastāra* " *Dāsavāda*".  /  If the accuser and the accused accuse each other or there is a debate between them, then the amount of *Prāyaścitta* also increases. That is, the *Caturlaghu* mentioned in the sūtra becomes *Caturguru* *Prāyaścitta*. If the accusation reaches its peak, then the *Prāyaścitta* is also given to the peak.  /  That is, the *Nirgrantha* with the fault has to bear the final *Prāyaścitta* *Pārañcīka*. For specific details, one should refer to the *Bhāṣya*.

[Sixth Uddeshak] [251 Sadhu-Sadhvi's mutual removal of thorns etc. - rules] 3. If a Niggrantha has a thorn, glass, or sharp stone stuck in his foot, and another Niggrantha is able to remove it or cleanse the area, then the Niggrantha who removes it or cleanses it does not violate the Jina-agya. 4. If a Niggrantha has a mosquito, seed, or dust in his eye, and another Niggrantha is unable to remove it or cleanse the area, then the Niggrantha who removes it or cleanses it does not violate the Jina-agya. 5. If a Niggranthi has a thorn, glass, or sharp stone stuck in her foot, and another Niggranthi is unable to remove it or cleanse the area, then the Niggranthi who removes it or cleanses it does not violate the Jina-agya. 6. If a Niggranthi has a mosquito, seed, or dust in her eye, and another Niggranthi is unable to remove it or cleanse the area, then the Niggranthi who removes it or cleanses it does not violate the Jina-agya.

A Niggrantha does not transgress the Jina's command by taking hold of or supporting a Niggranthi who is falling or slipping from a dangerous (inhabited by ferocious animals), uneven, or mountainous place. 8. A Niggrantha does not transgress the Jina's command by taking hold of or supporting a Niggranthi who is falling or sinking into mud, mire, or water. 9. A Niggrantha does not transgress the Jina's command by taking hold of or supporting a Niggranthi who is boarding or disembarking a boat. 10.

---------------------------
[Sixth Uddeshak] [253 11. A Nirgranthi with a disturbed mind (Kshipta Chitta) may accept Nirgrantha food or support from another Nirgranthi without violating the Jina-agya. 12. A Nirgranthi possessed by a Yaksha may accept Nirgrantha food or support from another Nirgranthi without violating the Jina-agya. 13. A Nirgranthi suffering from madness (Unmada) may accept Nirgrantha food or support from another Nirgranthi without violating the Jina-agya. 14. A Nirgranthi afflicted by an upsarga (Upsarga-prapta) may accept Nirgrantha food or support from another Nirgranthi without violating the Jina-agya. 15. A Nirgranthi who has calmed down from intense passions (Saadhikaran) may accept Nirgrantha food or support from another Nirgranthi without violating the Jina-agya. 16. A Nirgranthi who is undergoing severe penance (Saprayaschitta) may accept Nirgrantha food or support from another Nirgranthi without violating the Jina-agya. 17. A Nirgranthi who has renounced food and drink (Bhakta-paan-pratyakhyata) may accept Nirgrantha food or support from another Nirgranthi without violating the Jina-agya. 18. A Nirgranthi who is seeking disciples or a position (Artha-jat) may accept Nirgrantha food or support from another Nirgranthi without violating the Jina-agya. 

The path of liberation for Nirgranthi-Nirgranthis is to never touch each other. If they do, they violate the Jina-agya. However, in the situations mentioned in the above sutras, Nirgranthi-Nirgranthis can help each other and provide service without violating the Jina-agya. 1. Kshipta Chitta - Disturbed mind due to sorrow or fear / 2. Dipta Chitta - Disturbed mind due to excessive joy / 3. Yaksha-vist - Possessed by a ghost, spirit, etc. / 4. Unmada-prapta - Mad due to delusion / 5. Upsarga-prapta - Afflicted by a deva, human, or a celestial being / 6. Saadhikaran - Calmed down from intense passions / 7. Saprayaschitta - Disturbed mind due to severe penance / 8. Bhakta-paan-pratyakhyata - Exhausted due to lifelong fasting / 9. Artha-jat - Disturbed due to the desire for disciples or a position / 

Nirgranthi-Nirgranthis who are mad, possessed by a ghost, afflicted by an upsarga, or fearful should take care of each other. They should stop those who are engaged in conflict or discord by holding their hands.

In the absence of other attendant Sadhvi, make arrangements for all kinds of care for the Nirgranthi who is about to die in Samadhi after rejecting the devotee. / Although many Sadhvis live together, in some special circumstances, it becomes necessary to take care of or assist the Sadhu because the Sadhvis cannot handle it. / The Sutra only mentions the Nirgranthi being supported by the Nirgranthi when falling, etc. But in some special circumstances, a Sadhvi can also support a falling Sadhu, etc., this should also be understood by implication.

Six completely fatal aspects of the Kalp Sadhvachar have been mentioned, such as 1. Doing bodily activity without seeing or cleaning, is fatal to restraint. 2. Talkativeness, is fatal to truthful speech. 3. Walking while looking here and there, is fatal to Iryasamiti. 4. Being annoyed by the lack of food, etc., is fatal to Esanasamiti. 5. Greed for equipment, etc., is fatal to Aparigraha / 6. Seeking Nirvana (desire for the fruits of penance) out of greed, i.e., desire for worldly pleasures, is fatal to the path of liberation. Because the Lord has praised non-desire and non-attachment everywhere. Discussion Although there are many tendencies that destroy the virtues of restraint, the present Sutra mentions the main six defects that destroy restraint. / The word "palimanthu" means to completely destroy the virtues of restraint in many ways. 1. Kautkuchya - whoever sits here and there without looking, keeps the body or hands, feet, head, etc., limbs without looking or without discretion, he is the destroyer of 17 types of restraint.

Page #209:
---------------------------
## Sixth Objective:

**2.  Maukarya (Excessive Speech):** Excessive speech is a fault of the tongue. One who speaks excessively neglects virtues like humility, becomes disliked, and speaks without thinking. Therefore, they speak untruthfully and unnecessarily, thus polluting the true great vow. The scriptures often refer to ascetics as those who speak little.  Being a person of few words is also considered one of the eight virtues of a lay follower.

**3. Chakshurlolya (Wandering Eyes):** One who looks around cannot follow the vow of non-violence. Their vow of non-violence is broken. It is not appropriate for an ascetic to look around while walking. This is because, due to the inability to see clearly, it is possible to harm living beings, both mobile and immobile. The restraint of the eye sense is for the protection of life in the first great vow. In the fourth great vow, the restraint of the eye sense is for not looking at women, etc. The second aspect of the fifth great vow is to maintain restraint over the eye sense.

**4. Titinaka (Grumbling):** One who becomes distressed and grumbles when they do not receive pleasing food, etc., and also neglects the faults of craving in obtaining desired food, is said to break the vow of non-attachment due to their nature of grumbling.

**5. Ichchhalolup (Greedy for Desires):** A monk who has an intense desire for delicious food, clothes, utensils, disciples, etc., does not follow the path of liberation, which is primarily based on non-attachment. Because the main characteristic of the path of liberation is the reduction of desires and attachment. One who destroys this is called a greedy seeker, who destroys the path of liberation.

**6. Bhidhya Nidankaran (Seeking Rewards):** A monk who, out of greed or attachment, seeks rewards (the intention of obtaining worldly pleasures as a result of righteous conduct) related to gods or any other kind of reward, will not attain liberation in future lives due to these reward-seeking intentions, and will continue to wander in hell, etc. Thus, this seeking of rewards is a barrier to attaining liberation. It is appropriate and non-seeking to pray to the Supreme Being only for the cultivation of virtues like knowledge, etc., or for the attainment of liberation, without any kind of greed or attachment. For example:

1. May the Tirthankaras be pleased with me.
2. May I receive the best of good fortune, peace, and happiness.
3. May the Siddhas grant me liberation. -~Aav. A. 2, Ga. 5-6-7

There is no greed in this kind of prayer, therefore, this prayer is conducive to liberation, not a hindrance. The commentator has explained the word "Bhidhya" in this way: "Bhidhya" means greed, and the seeking of rewards due to that greed. Seeking with the intention of getting rid of worldly suffering and following the path of liberation is not a hindrance to the path of liberation. -Brihatkalpa Bhashya, Part 6

In many copies, due to errors, the word "Bhidhya" has been replaced with "Bhujjo", etc., which are later additions after the commentator.

Boundaries of Chhedopasthapaniyacharitra, 3. Boundaries of the one who carries out penance in Pariharavishuddhicharitra, 4. Boundaries of the Guru-kalpa and Anu-pariharic Bhikshus in Pariharavishuddhicharitra, 5. Boundaries of the Jinakalp Bhikshus who live a special ascetic life, having emerged from the Gachchha, 6. Boundaries of the Sthavirakalp, that is, the Gachchha-dwelling Bhikshus. Discussion - Here, the meaning of "Kalpa" is the conduct of a Sannyata. Remaining in that is called Kalpasthiti. The Samachari (boundaries) of Nirgrantha-Nirgranthis is also called Kalpasthiti. It is said to be of six types. As follows: 1. Samayikasannyata-Kalpasthiti - To remain in Samabhava and to abandon all Saavdha tendencies, this is Samayikasannyata-Kalpasthiti. This is of two types: 1. Itvarkalik - Until the five Mahavratas are imposed, it is Itvarkalik Samayik-Kalpasthiti. 2. Yavajjivic - Samayik that remains for life, Yavajjivic Samayikkalpasthiti. In which the Mahavratas are not imposed again, this happens during the reign of the Madhyama Tirthankaras / 2. Chhedopasthapaniy-Sannyata-Kalpasthiti - To give the great initiation or to impose the Mahavratas again. This Kalpasthiti is of two types: 1. Niratichaar - To impose the five Mahavratas on the teachers who are Itvar Samayik or on the disciples of Bhagwan Parshvanath, this is Niratichaar Chhedopasthapaniy-Sannyata-Kalpasthiti.

---------------------------
##  Translation:

**Chapter Six:  The Objective**

**257. 2.  **After accepting the five great vows (mahavrata) of the Saṃti-cara, if a nirgrantha or nirgranthi knowingly breaks one or all five of these vows, then the cutting off of their previous initiation (dīkṣā-paryāya) and the re-establishment of the great vows is the state of the Saṃti-cara-chhedopasthāpanīya-saṃyata-kalpasthiti.

**3.  **The state of the nirviśamāna-kalpasthiti is the state of those ascetics who are engaged in the practice of austerity (tapa) in the purity of restraint (pariharaviśuddhi).

**4.  **The state of the nirviṣṭakāyika-kalpasthiti is the state of those ascetics who have completed the practice of austerity in the purity of restraint.

**5.  **The state of the jina-kalpasthiti is the state of those ascetics who are solitary wanderers, who eat from their hands (pāṇipātra-bhojī), and who are engaged in the study of the scriptures (gītartha), and who have left their monastic order (gaccha).

**6.  **The state of the sthavira-kalpasthiti is the state of those ascetics who remain within their monastic order (gaccha) under the guidance of the ācārya and others.

Thus, the Tīrthaṃkaras have described six types of kalpasthiti for ascetics.

**Chapter Six: Summary of the Objective**

**1.  **Ascetics (sādhu-sādhvī) should not speak six types of unjustifiable words. They should not make false accusations against any ascetic. Because in the absence of evidence, they will have to undergo penance themselves.  

**2.  **Due to circumstances, ascetics can remove thorns or other objects from each other's feet, and they can also remove dust or other objects from each other's eyes.

**3-18.  **In special circumstances mentioned in the sūtras, ascetics can provide support and care to each other. Ascetics should be aware of the six faults that destroy restraint (saṃyama) and abandon them. There are six types of moral conduct (ācāra-maryādā) based on the different practices of those who uphold restraint.

**Conclusion**

This chapter prohibits the speaking of unjustifiable words, describes the penance for making false accusations without evidence, and outlines the mutual service duties of ascetics in exceptional circumstances (3-18).
