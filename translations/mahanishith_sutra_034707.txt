[39] Mahanishith Chhed Sutra-6 - Hindi Translation
Study-1-Shalyodharan Sutra-1

Salutations to the Tirthankaras, salutations to the Arhant Bhagavants.
I have heard from the Ayushman Bhagavant that, here, any Sadhu or Sadhvi who engages in a deceptive action, should, according to the 'Mahanishith' Shruta Skandha Shruta, which is extremely profound, extremely excellent, and the ultimate truth and essence, be free from all three types of (mind, speech, body) and three types of (doing, causing to do, approving) in all ways, and free from internal and external impurities, for the benefit of the soul,
should engage in extremely severe, heroic, intense, and arduous austerities and practices, completely abandoning all attachments to distractions, spending all their time, both night and day, free from distractions, constantly in a state of sorrow, with unwavering, great faith, devotion, and detachment, without hiding their strength, power, effort, and courage, without feeling shame, with a body that has renounced possessions, with a focused mind, repeatedly immersing themselves in austerities, practices, etc. Sutra-2

But, many distractions in the name of attachment, aversion, delusion, objects, passions, knowledge attachments, prosperity, taste, pride of the three types, anger-filled meditation, sorrowful meditation, falsehood, wrong belief, non-restraint (of mind, speech, body), evil association, indulgence in non-righteous things, laziness, etc., gossiping, falsely accusing, quarreling, being intoxicated by the eight types of pride (caste, etc.), envy, arrogance, anger, possessiveness, ego, many types of darkness-filled heart,
should not be present without closing the broken doors of the flow of impurities, which are like a thick, intense, extremely fierce, heavy, smooth, sinful karma-dirt, which leads to violence, theft, lying, sexual misconduct, attachment, intention, etc., which are the beginning of inauspicious results.
Having said this, Sadhus and Sadhvis should not be involved in the flow of impurities. Sutra-3

(When Sadhus or Sadhvis know their faults, then) even for a moment, a second, a Muhurta, a blink of an eye, half a blink, or even a fraction of a half blink, the time that is free from impurities is like this. Sutra-4-6

When I become completely calm and then become detached from all objects, abandoning attachment, aversion, and delusion, then the soul, which experiences devotion, should think with a focused mind, in the right way, about the path to the afterlife, "Oh! Where will I go after death? What Dharma have I attained? What vows and rules do I have? What austerities have I practiced? What conduct have I adopted? What have I donated?" Sutra-7-9

What will enable me to attain happiness and prosperity in heaven or the human realm, in a low, middle, or high family? Or what is the benefit of being sorrowful? I know the soul well, I know my bad character, my faults, and my virtues. In this way, I will go to the hellish underworld, which is filled with intense darkness, where I will have to endure thousands of sufferings for a long time.

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'
Study/Purpose/Sutra Number Sutra-10-11
In this way, all beings know Dharma-Adharma, Sukh-Dukha, etc. Gautama! Among them, there are some beings who do not practice Dharma, which is beneficial to the soul, due to Moha and ignorance. And then, if someone practices such Dharma, which is beneficial to the soul for the afterlife, out of Maya-Dambha, they will not feel its benefit. Sutra-12-14
This soul is mine. I know my soul truly. It is difficult to realize the soul. Dharma also happens through self-witness. Whoever considers something beneficial or dear, they establish it on a beautiful path. (Because) a lioness considers her cruel child to be more dear. All beings in the world, without thinking that "other souls are like my own", imagine the soul as Anatma and behave with evil speech, body, and mind, including actions. When that soul is called innocent. It is free from impurities. It has abandoned partiality. It is far away from the sinful and impure heart. And it is free from the net of equal faults. Sutra-15-16
Such men, who are established in the true meaning, the essence, and who prove the wonderful thing, through the rituals performed by them, that (innocent) soul delights itself. Such a soul has the highest Dharma, the highest Tapas-Sampatti, good character, and conduct, therefore, they attain the highest state. Sutra-17-18
O Gautama! There are also some beings who have reached such a high level, but still practice Dharma with a 'Shalya' (blemish) in their mind, and cannot understand the benefit of the soul. If such a person, with a 'Shalya', performs Tapas of the painful, fierce, severe, and heroic class, like a deity, for a thousand years, will that Tapas be fruitless? Sutra-19
The 'Shalya' which is not criticized. It is not condemned or dusted, or the scriptural atonement is not done. That 'Shalya' is also called sin. Sutra-20
Maya, Dambha, and deceit are not appropriate. Performing big secret sins, practicing Ajayana and Anachar, keeping 'Shalya' in the mind, all this accumulates eight Karmas. Sutra-21-26
_ Asanayam, Adharma, lack of good character and vows, being with Kshaya, impurity of Yoga, all these destroy good deeds and virtues, and make one wander in such a terrible state from which one cannot escape, and then one has to suffer extreme anguish in the endless world full of physical and mental pain, some get ugliness of form, poverty, misfortune, pain that causes havoc, a living being who gets deprived, cruelty, lack of compassion, cruelty, lack of mercy, shamelessness, a hidden heart, crookedness, opposite mindedness, attachment, hatred, delusion, terrible falsehood, destruction of the right path, getting disgrace, disobedience, ignorance, being without 'Shalya', all these are Bhavo-Bhavas. In this way, many synonyms of the sin 'Shalya' are explained. Sutra-27-30
_ Once, a person with a 'Shalya' heart, in many other births, suffers from 'Shalya' pain in all limbs and appendages repeatedly. That 'Shalya' is described in two ways. Subtle and Gross. Both of them have three types each. Severe, Fierce, and Fiercer. Severe Maya is of four types. It is severe, fierce, human-like, and also full of Maya, greed, and anger. Similarly, understand these four divisions of Fierce and Fiercer. The Muni, by liberating these 'Shalyas' with their subtle and gross divisions and their sub-divisions,

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

**Study/Purpose/Sutra Number:** Please provide it quickly, but the Muni should not remain with the affliction even for a moment. Sutra-31-32

**Just as a snake's offspring is small, a mustard seed-sized fire is small, but if it sticks, it destroys. After its touch, separation is not possible. Similarly, if minor or even smaller karmic afflictions are not removed, they cause great suffering and increase the cycle of rebirth.** Sutra-33-37

**O Bhagavan! Some people do not even know how to remove this karmic affliction that can be removed through suffering, and then causes suffering. O Gautam! This karmic affliction is said to be completely uprooted. No matter how difficult the affliction is, it is said to be pierced along with all its parts and limbs. First, right faith, second, right knowledge, and third, right conduct, when these three are gathered together, when the being becomes the field of the affliction, and the karmic affliction has reached a very deep place, you cannot even see it, it is in the bones and within them, trapped in all parts and limbs, causing pain inside and out, such an affliction should be uprooted.** Sutra-38-40

**Action without knowledge is useless, and knowledge without action is also not successful. Just as a blind man who can see and a lame man who can run die in a wildfire, therefore, O Gautam! When both are combined, the work is accomplished. A chariot does not run on one wheel. When the blind and the lame become one, that is, the lame shows the way and the blind follows it, then both, crossing the forest of wildfire, reach the desired city safely and without hindrance. Knowledge illuminates, austerity purifies the soul, and restraint prevents the senses and mind from going astray. When these three are truly combined, O Gautam! There is liberation. Otherwise, there is no liberation.** Sutra-41-42

**Therefore, those who, free from afflictions, renounce all afflictions, and serve Dharma with freedom from afflictions, their restraint is considered successful. Not only that, but they obtain abundant wealth and prosperity in birth after birth, and enjoy eternal happiness by tradition.** Sutra-43-47

**A soul aspiring to remove afflictions, such as transgressions and other faults, should observe a fast or perform Ayambil tapasya for ten days, with auspicious days, good tithi, karana, muhurta, and a strong moon. Then, they should chant the eight hundred Panchamangala (Mahashrutaskandha) mantras. After that, they should observe three more fasts and perform Ayambil tapasya. On the day of breaking the fast, they should pay homage to the Chaitya, the Jinalaya, and the Sadhus. They should make their soul free from anger and full of forgiveness. They should offer "Micchami Dukkadam" with their mind, speech, and body, free from afflictions, to all those who have done any wrong deeds.** Sutra-48-50

**Then, going back to the Chaityalaya, they should offer heartfelt and focused devotion to the image of the Vitaraga Supreme Being, and offer praise to everyone. After paying homage to the Chaitya with proper rituals, they should perform the sixth devotional tapasya and chant the Vidya called Shrutadeva for a lakh times in the Chaityalaya. They should chant with a calm mind, focused mind, firm determination, dedication, a steady mind, free from attachment, desire, and aversion, in the sacred place of the Chaityalaya.** Sutra-51

**(This Sutra contains mantras, which cannot be translated into Hindi. Those who are curious should refer to our Agam Suttanni, Muni Diparatnasagar Krit (Mahanishith) Agam Sutra-Hindi Translation)**

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

(Study/Purpose/Sutra Number Part-39 Mahanishith Page-5 should be seen.) Sutra - 52

The Siddhantis have given this knowledge in Sutra-51 in the original Ardhamagadhi language, written in the Mahavidya script. This discourse of knowledge should not be given to or explained to those who do not understand the essence of the scriptures, who are foolish. Sutra - 53-55

By this excellent knowledge, one should completely control oneself, suppress the senses, and sleep with a controlled mind. Whatever auspicious or inauspicious dream one sees in sleep, one should carefully observe and remember it. According to the nature of the dream seen, one should consider it auspicious or inauspicious. If the dream is beautiful, one should understand that it is the essence of the ultimate truth, the removal of the 'Shalya' (affliction). Sutra - 56-57

In this way, one should offer pure criticism to the soul desiring to be free from 'Shalya', praising the Siddhas who reside in the front part of the world. One should criticize one's own sins, reveal them to the Guru, and become free from 'Shalya'. After that, one should also worship the 'Chaitya' (shrine) and the 'Sadhu' (saint) and properly apologize to the 'Sadhu'. Sutra - 58-62

By apologizing for the 'Papashalya' (sinful affliction), one should again, according to the proper procedure, give joy to the world, including gods and demons, and remove the 'Shalya' through complete eradication. According to that, one should become free from 'Shalya', and again, according to the proper procedure, worship the 'Chaitya' and apologize to the 'Sadharmic' (those who follow the right path). Especially to those with whom one has lived in an 'Upashraya' (shelter), with whom one has wandered from village to village, those who have given inspiration through 'Saran' (refuge) etc., those to whom one has spoken harsh, severe, and cruel words, whether in the course of work or without any reason, and who have also responded in front of you, whether they are alive or dead, one should apologize to them with all one's heart. If they are alive, one should apologize to them with humility, and if they are dead, one should apologize in the presence of a 'Sadhu' (saint). Sutra - 63-65

In this way, one should apologize to the three worlds with all one's heart, and becoming pure in mind, speech, and body, one should declare with certainty, "I forgive all beings. May all beings forgive me. I have a feeling of friendship towards all beings. I have no animosity towards any being. I, who come into contact with every being in this world and the next, forgive everyone with all my heart, in every way, through mind, speech, and body." Sutra - 66

Having established and declared this, one should worship the 'Chaitya', and with the witness of the 'Sadhu', one should properly apologize to the Guru. Sutra - 67-70

Having properly apologized to the Guru Bhagvant, one should praise the glory of knowledge according to one's capacity. Again, one should worship with the proper procedure. How to perform this 'Shalyoddharan' (removal of affliction), which is the ultimate truth, the essence, and the same as the essence, one should learn from the Guru's mouth. Having learned, one should criticize accordingly, so that only knowledge is generated through criticism.

One should remain in such a beautiful state of mind and perform 'Nishalya' (affliction-free) criticism, so that only knowledge is generated through criticism. O Gautam! Some great souls, great men, are mentioned who, through criticism with feeling, generated only knowledge. Sutra - 71-75

Yes, I have done evil deeds, I have thought evil thoughts, yes, I have given false approval, with such feeling and emotion...

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

**Only those who have attained Kevalgyan (omniscience) can analyze the study/purpose/sutra number.** They became Kevalis by placing their feet with Iryasamiti (proper posture), they became Kevalis by copying the scriptures with Muhpatti (proper pronunciation), they became Kevalis by performing the right kind of Pratikraman (atonement), they became Kevalis by thinking "Ha-ha, I am a sinner", they became Kevalis by repenting, "Ha-ha, I became insane and acted against the right path", they became Kevalis by being in the state of Anagar (non-attachment), they became Kevalis by following the unbroken Shila (conduct) by not consuming food with Savadha Yoga (mindfulness), they became Kevalis by protecting the Shila in all ways, they became Kevalis by performing countless types of Pratikraman. (Sutra 76-78)

They became Kevalis by performing Nishpattikarma (purification) like cleaning the impurities of the body, they became Kevalis by not scratching, not even blinking their eyes, they became Kevalis by staying in one place for two Prahar (three hours) and observing Maunvrat (silence), they became Kevalis by thinking, "I am not capable of following Sadhupana (virtue), therefore I will remain in Anashan (fasting)", they became Kevalis by counting Navkar (prayer), they became Kevalis by thinking, "I am blessed to have received such a teaching, even after obtaining all the material possessions, why haven't I become a Kevali?" (Sutra 79-80)

They became Kevalis by thinking, "Until people call me a sinner like a strong guard, I will not leave the Kaussagg (state of being a Kevali)", they became Kevalis by thinking, "Oh! It will be Ajayana (violence) and Jiva-viradhana (harm to living beings)" when their feet touched a moving piece of wood, they became Kevalis by saying, "I will perform Pratikraman in the pure side", they became Kevalis by thinking, "Our life is fickle", "This humanity is impermanent and momentary". (Sutra 81-83)

They became Kevalis by enduring countless hardships through criticism, slander, praise, severe and difficult Pratikraman, they became Kevalis by removing their hand (like the way Kevalgyan happened when Chandanbala removed her hand), they became Kevalis by living in a dwelling, they became Kevalis by eating like Kurugadamuni (half-Kevali) and performing tapasya (austerity) like eating one grain after ten years, they became Kevalis by starting Pratikraman, they became Kevalis by performing half-Pratikraman, they became Kevalis by completing Pratikraman, they became Kevalis by attaining Kevalgyan like Rishabhdev etc. in the excellent 108 count. (Sutra 84-87)

They became Kevalis by thinking, "How good it would be if I became a Kevali quickly without purification and Pratikraman", they became Kevalis by thinking, "Now I will perform such Pratikraman that I don't have to perform tapasya and conduct", they became Kevalis by thinking, "Even by giving up my life, I will not violate the command of the Jineswar Paramatma (Supreme Soul)", they became Kevalis by thinking, "This body is different and the soul is different, I have attained Samyaktva (right faith)", they became Kevalis by thinking, "This is how Kevalgyan happens". (Sutra 88-90)

They became Kevalis by thinking, "I will cleanse the dirt of the Karmas (actions) attached to the soul since the beginning of time", they became Kevalis by thinking, "Now I will not perform any other conduct due to carelessness", they became Kevalis by thinking, "If the body decays, let my body-soul be destroyed, restraint is the pure essence of the body", they became Kevalis by thinking, "If the Shila is broken even by the mind, I will not sustain life, and then I will protect the Shila by speech and body". (Sutra 91-95)

In this way, they attained Munipana (state of being a monk) by wandering since the beginning of time. In some births, some criticism was successful. Oh Gautam! In some births, they became the one who purifies the mind through Pratikraman, the one who forgives, the one who controls the senses, the one who is content, the one who conquers the senses, the one who speaks the truth, the one who is free from the three types of bondage from the beginning of the six types of living beings, the one who is free from the three types of restraint, the one who is free from the restraint of speech and body, the one who does not talk to women, the one who does not look at the limbs of women, the one who... (This way, it is explained in which states Kevalgyan happened).

## Criticism (Aalocna)

**Sharakat**
Aagam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

**Do not have attachment to study, purpose, or sutra numbers. Do not have attachment to the time, place, or person of the journey. Be afraid of being in the womb of a woman with a great desire for wealth. Be afraid of the many sorrows and fears of the world. With this kind of feeling, give criticism to the critic who comes to the Guru to reveal his faults.**

**The critic should also do penance to the Guru. The penance should be done in the same order as the fault was committed.** Sutra - 96-98

**The critic should not criticize with Maya, pride, or malice. Such criticism increases the world. I will tell you the names of those who have fallen into the lower realms, who have been afflicted by evil thoughts for an endless time, who have been in the ocean of the world with many waves, and who have been criticized even after committing criticism. They are those who have received penance along with criticism, and whose minds are polluted by emotional faults.** Sutra - 99-102

**The wicked person who has committed sin by criticizing and doing penance with malice, endures great unbearable suffering. He lives there enduring unbearable suffering. He is a heavy consumer of unrestraint, hates the virtuous, is devoid of virtue in sight and speech, and is also wicked in mind. He criticizes subtle matters. He asks, "What is the penance for what others have done?" and does penance himself. He criticizes a little, criticizes a little, criticizes even if he has not committed the fault, criticizes others in front of people for their entertainment, criticizes with the thought, "I will not do penance," or criticizes deceitfully.** Sutra - 103-105

**He speaks of the austerities and conduct done in the past with Maya, pride, and deceit. He says, "I do not feel any penance," or does not reveal the faults committed. He reveals the faults committed nearby. He asks for small penances. He says, "We make such efforts that there is no opportunity to receive criticism." He asks for criticism that will lead to auspicious bondage. He says, "I am unable to do great penance." He does not do penance by relying on the service of the sick, saying, "I have to serve the sick." The critic, the virtuous, ignores him.** Sutra - 106-108

**He does not do penance, saying, "I will not do penance for the sake of appeasement, I will not do penance with my tongue to please people." After accepting penance, he enters it after a long time, that is, he conducts himself, or he does something else after accepting penance. He repeatedly commits great sins with cruelty. He is proud of the object of love, Kamadeva, saying, "Even if I give any penance, I am capable of doing it." And then he commits penance by ignoring the penance-free consumption.** Sutra - 109-113

**He does penance as described in the book. He does penance according to his own imagination. He does penance according to the previous criticism. He becomes attached to caste, family, caste and family, knowledge, profit, wealth, austerity, scholarship, respect, etc. He is excited by pride, thinking, "I am not worthy of worship, I am alone." He criticizes with the pollution, "I am a great sinner." He criticizes through others or with disrespect. He criticizes unlawfully. He criticizes with such evil feelings as mentioned above.** Sutra - 114-116

**O Gautam! The soul who has been consuming emotional faults for an endless time has gone down to the seventh hell, inside, due to the suffering caused by the virtuous. O Gautam! In such a world, the virtuous are free from malice. They are their own...**

**O Gautama!** There is no count of **śramaṇī** (female ascetics) who, with a pure, **śalya**-free, **viśuddha** (pure), **śuddha** (clean), **nirmala** (stainless), **vimala** (spotless) mind, having cleansed themselves through **abhyantara viśodhi** (internal purification), by scrutinizing and removing all **bhāva-śalya** (mental blemishes) like **ati-cāra** (excess) etc., through the practice of **tapo-karma** (austerity), by fully performing **prāyaścitta** (atonement), by washing away the stains like the dirt of **pāpa-karma** (sinful actions), have attained **divya-uttama** (divine and supreme) **kevala-jñāna** (omniscience), and are **mahānubhāga** (great in virtue), **mahā-yaśa** (great in fame), **mahā-sattva** (great in being), **sampannā** (prosperous), **su-grahita** (well-controlled), **nāma-dhārī** (name-bearing), and have attained **moksha** (liberation) with infinite supreme happiness. **Sūtra-118-120**

**O Gautama!** Some **sādhvī** (female ascetics) who have attained **kevala-jñāna** (omniscience) through scrutiny are called **puṇya-bhāgī** (blessed). **Oh!** I am a **pāpīṇī** (sinner), a **pāpa-matī** (sinful-minded) woman. Indeed, I am a **pāpīṇī** (sinner) who has committed many sins. **Oh!** I have indulged in many evil thoughts. Because I was born a woman in this life, I will now practice **ghora** (intense), **vīra** (heroic), **ugra** (fierce), **kaṣṭa-dāya** (painful) **tapa** (austerity) and **samyama** (self-control). **Sūtra-121-125**

An infinite amount of **pāpa-rāśi** (sinful actions) accumulate to obtain the **śuddha** (pure) state of womanhood. Now, I will make the accumulated **pāpa-karma** (sinful actions) that led to womanhood so thin that I will not be a woman anymore and will attain **kevala-jñāna** (omniscience). I will not even look at **śīya-khaṇḍana** (sexual intercourse) anymore. Now, I will become a **śramaṇa-kevalī** (male omniscient ascetic). **Oh!** In the past, I may have thought some **āhaṭṭa-dohaṭṭa** (very evil) thoughts. I will scrutinize and purify them quickly and become a **śramaṇī-kevalī** (female omniscient ascetic). Seeing my beauty, radiance, brilliance, and splendor, someone might become like a **titali** (butterfly), a **madhma** (low) being, and perish. To prevent that, I will become a **kevalī** (omniscient) in the state of **śramaṇī** (female ascetic). Now, I will definitely not touch anyone other than **vāyara** (air). **Sūtra-126-129**

I will not engage in the **ārambha-samārambha** (beginning and continuation) of the six **kāya** (bodies) of living beings. I will become a **śramaṇī-kevalī** (female omniscient ascetic). I will keep my body, waist, breasts, thighs, the inner part of my private area, navel, and the area between the thighs, etc., all **gopan** (hidden) and will not even tell my mother about them. With this intention, the **sādhvī** (female ascetic) became a **kevalī** (omniscient). I have gone through countless **bhavantara** (past lives), and while following the tradition of **garbhāvāsa** (womb-dwelling), I have somehow attained the knowledge that destroys **pāpa-karma** (sinful actions) and the beautiful humanity with **cāritra** (good conduct). Now, I will scrutinize and criticize all **bhāva-śalya** (mental blemishes) every moment. With the intention of not committing such sins again, I will perform **prāyaścitta** (atonement). **Sūtra-130-132**

I will not engage in any actions of **mana** (mind), **vacana** (speech), and **kāya** (body) that require **prāyaścitta** (atonement), such as the **samārambha** (beginning) of **pṛthvī** (earth), **jala** (water), **agni** (fire), **vāyu** (air), **vanaspati-kāya** (plant body), and **bīja-kāya** (seed body), or the **samārambha** (beginning) of two, three, four, or five-sense beings, which means I will not kill, lie, accept dust and ashes that have not been given, even in my dreams, I will not desire sexual intercourse with my mind, and I will not possess anything that could lead to the **skhalanā** (slip) of **mūla-guṇa** (root qualities) and **uttara-guṇa** (higher qualities). **Sūtra-133-136**

I will be free from **mada** (intoxication), **bhaya** (fear), **kaṣāya** (passions), **mana** (mind), **vacana** (speech), and **kāya** (body), the three **daṇḍa** (punishments), and will dwell in **gupti** (secrecy) and **samiti** (harmony), and will control my senses. I will become a being with a body adorned with eighteen thousand **śīlāṅga** (virtues), and will dwell in **svādhyāya** (self-study), **dhyāna** (meditation), and **yoga** (union). I will become such a **śramaṇī-kevalī** (female omniscient ascetic). I, who will wear the **linga-cihna** (symbol) that the **dharma-tīrthankara** (religious ford-maker), who is like a pillar capable of protecting the three realms, has worn, will perhaps be ground in a **yantra** (machine) and my body will be cut into two pieces.

Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'
Go to the study/purpose/sutra number, tear or rip me apart. Be thrown into a blazing fire, have my head pierced, even then I will not break the vows I have taken, nor will I mentally break my character and conduct even for a single birth. I will become a Kevali as a Shramana. Sutra - 137-139
I have wandered a lot in the realm of donkeys, camels, dogs, etc., being attached to desires. I have done countless karmas in infinite births and future births that are not worthy of being done. Now, even after entering the order, if I do such evil deeds, then it will be difficult for me to escape from the hellish earth, which is full of darkness. Such a beautiful human birth, when spread out in the objects of desire due to attachment, becomes the recipient of many sorrows. Sutra - 140-144
Human birth is impermanent, it is by nature prone to destruction in an instant, it is a mixture of many sins, punishments and faults. I was born as a woman in that, which is condemned by the entire three realms, but even then, having obtained such a religion without obstacles and hindrances, I will not now in any way obstruct that religion with sins and faults. I will not now engage in any kind of adornment, attachment, passion, or desire. I will not even look at any man with a peaceful gaze, except for the preacher of religion. I will not converse with him either. I will follow the criticism given in the same way as the great sin that I could not tell, and the pain that arose from it. With such a feeling, I will become a Shramana-Kevali. Sutra - 145-148
In that way, giving (receiving) pure criticism, countless Shramanas become free from pain, having attained Kevalgyan in the beginningless time, O Gautam! Having attained Siddhi, suppressing the senses of forgiveness, conquering the senses of contentment, speaking the truth, abstaining from the six types of karma from the beginning of the three types, stopping the flow of the three types of karma, abandoning the stories of men and the company of men, abstaining from conversation and seeing the limbs of men, free from attachment to one's own body, great in glory, unattached to the field of matter, time, and feeling, that is, free from attachment, afraid of womanhood, pregnancy, and the cycle of births, such a feeling (of the Sadhvis) should be criticized. Sutra - 149-151
Do penance in the same way as these Shramanas have done penance, but do not criticize anyone with illusion or pride, because doing so increases sinful karma. The Sadhvi who has been criticizing with illusion, pride, and deceit from the beginningless infinite time, has become full of pain, has obtained servitude as if she has to rule, and has gone to the sixth hell by tradition. Sutra - 152-153
I am telling you the names of some Sadhvis, understand and believe that they have criticized. But by consuming the feeling-fault (like illusion and deceit), their restraint and the limbs of their character have been eroded by the dirt of sinful karma in a special way. The praise of that freedom from pain, which is not free from perfect purity even for a moment. Sutra - 154-155
Therefore, O Gautam! Some women do not have such pure, pure mind, even in future births, that they can attain freedom from pain. Some Shramanas, by fasting repeatedly, such as six-day fast, eight-day fast, four-day fast, five-day fast, dry up their bodies, but they do not criticize or abandon the feeling of attachment. Sutra - 156-157
Giving many options, he immersed himself in the sorrow of the waves of the surging series.

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Chhedasūtra-5, 'Mahānishīth'

It is impossible to know the one who wanders like a mind in the ocean of the Paras, who can find the Paras. How can one who is not free of mind give criticism? Those who remove the salya of such a salya-bearer are worthy of being worshipped every moment. Sūtra - 158-160

Free from attachment and aversion, with a feeling of affection, delighting in Dharma-meditation, possessing the limbs of virtue and the abode of excellent qualities, a woman and many other bonds, considering home, woman, etc. as a prison, with a very pure and extremely pure mind, and who removes the salya, such a great-renowned man is worthy of being seen, worshipped, and is superior, even the Devendra is worthy of being worshipped by him. He who, having renounced all worldly things, attains such a state of renunciation, is worthy of being seen and worshipped. Sūtra-161-163

(It is explained how those sādhvīs who do not criticize the salya receive the fruits of the world.) I will not criticize, why should I? Or let the sādhvī criticize a little, not many faults, let the sādhvīs speak only of the faults they have seen, I speak only of the faultless and sinless, for the sake of knowledge, etc., one has to take the fault, what is there to criticize in that? A śramaṇī who asks for forgiveness for negligence, a śramaṇī who commits sin, a śramaṇī who does not have the strength to speak, a śramaṇī who speaks against the world, "Others have committed such a sin, how much criticism is there." Saying this, she takes criticism upon herself, if she has heard of the atonement for such a fault, let her do it according to that, but let her not confess her own fault, and a śramaṇī who is suspicious in eight ways, such as caste, etc. (do not take such pure criticism) Sūtra- 164-165

Do not take criticism for fear of being caught after lying, being corrupted by rasa, ṛddhi, śatā, and garva, and then being subject to many such emotional faults, filled with sinful salya, such śramaṇīs have been countless in number and for countless ages. Those countless śramaṇīs have gone to many places of suffering. Sūtra - 166-167

Countless śramaṇīs who are afflicted with the salya of the beginningless salya. They have suffered the pain of the bitter taste of the fruit, which is severe, fierce, and fiercer, acquired from only one salya in the form of emotional faults, and are still in hell today, and will continue to experience the bitter fruit acquired from such salya for countless ages in the future. Therefore, śramaṇīs should not even take on the slightest salya for a moment. Sūtra - 168-169

The body easily burns in the great, terrifying, heavy, great fire, which is agitated by a row of flames ignited by the word "dhag dhag". It is better to die than to suffer the pain of diving into the embers, then into the water, then from there to the land, then from there the body again into the river. Sūtra-170-171

It is easy to make one's body dead by smearing it with lime, turmeric, etc. It is easy to cut off one's head with one's own hands. But it is difficult to practice such austerity, so that one becomes free from salya.

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'
Study/Purpose/Sutra Number Sutra- 174-177
One who is afflicted by his own 'Shalya' (sinful act), and hides the 'Shalya-Pap' (sinful act) committed due to Maya (illusion) and Dambha (pride), cannot reveal his 'Shalya'. Perhaps a king of bad character might ask him to give up all his possessions and his body, but he would not be able to confess his bad character. Perhaps the king might say, "I will give you the entire earth, but you must reveal your bad character." Even then, no one would be willing to confess their bad character. At that time, even the earth would be considered like a blade of grass, but they would not confess their bad character. The king might say, "I will take your life, so tell me your bad character." Even then, they would not confess their bad character even if they lost their life. Even if they lose all their possessions, their kingdom, or their life, no one would confess their bad character. I too, perhaps, would go to the Patal-Narak (hell), but I would not confess my bad character. Sutra- 178-179
A man who is a sinner, a wicked person, and hides the sin of one birth, is a person who hides his own bad character. He is not called a 'Mahapurash' (great person). A 'Satpurush' (righteous person) is one who is immersed in 'Tap' (austerity) without any 'Shalya'. Sutra- 180-183
The soul itself should not desire to commit 'Pap-Shalya' (sinful act), and in the time of half a blink of an eye, it can be freed from the burden of infinite sins. With a mind free from 'Dambha' (pride) and 'Maya' (illusion), through meditation, self-study, intense 'Tap' (austerity), and self-control, one can liberate oneself from their sins at that very moment. By criticizing oneself without any 'Shalya', by self-condemnation, by humbling oneself before the Guru (spiritual teacher), one should perform such a strong 'Prayashchit' (atonement) that the 'Shalya' is completely eradicated. In the next birth, one should fully earn and become firmly established in the soul, but the 'Pap-Shalya' should be eradicated within a blink of an eye, half a blink of an eye, a moment, or a lifetime. Sutra- 184-185
He is truly a 'Subhat' (noble person), a 'Purush' (man), a 'Tapasvi' (ascetic), a 'Pandit' (scholar), a 'Kshamavala' (forgiving), a 'Indriya-Vash' (one who controls the senses), a 'Santoshi' (content). His life is successful. He is a 'Shurvir' (brave), worthy of praise. He is worthy of seeing every moment, who has confessed his sins to his Guru, ready to accept pure criticism, and has clearly revealed his bad character. Sutra- 186-189
O Gautam! There are some beings in the world who eradicate half of their 'Shalya' and due to 'Maya' (illusion), 'Lajja' (shame), 'Bhay' (fear), and 'Moh' (attachment), they lie and keep half of the 'Shalya' in their mind. Such beings of low character suffer greatly from this. Due to the fault of ignorance, they do not think that they will surely suffer in the future because they have not eradicated the 'Shalya' from their mind. Just as if a thorn or a sharp object with one or two points enters someone's body and is not removed, it will cause pain in that one birth, in that one place, or it will become like flesh. But if 'Pap-Shalya' (sinful act) enters the soul, then just as a vajra (thunderbolt) with countless points pierces a mountain, this 'Shalya' pierces the entire body for countless births. Sutra- 190-192
O Gautam! There are also some beings who, after countless births, have eradicated their 'Shalya' through self-study, meditation, yoga, intense 'Tap' (austerity), and self-control, and have become free from suffering and distress, but again, due to double or triple negligence, become full of 'Shalya'. Then, after many births, they may gain the ability to eradicate the 'Shalya' through 'Tap' (austerity) that burns away karma. Sutra- 193-196
In the same way, even if one obtains the means to eradicate the 'Shalya' again, anyone who is under the influence of negligence loses all the means of achieving well-being in this and future births. The thief of negligence steals the wealth of well-being. O Gautam! There are also some beings who, under the influence of negligence, consume intense 'Tap' (austerity) but...

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

**Despite studying/purpose/sutra number, they hide their shalya in every way. But they don't know from whom they have hidden this shalya? Because the five Lokapals, their soul and five senses, nothing is secret from them. In this world, including the Suras and Asuras, nothing is secret from the five great Lokapals, the soul and the five senses, from those eleven. Sutra - 197**

**O Gautam! In the four gatis, the same world, deceived by the pleasures of the world like a mirage, cheated by the shalya like a mental defect, and wanders in the four gatis of the world. Sutra - 198-200**

**Having understood this in detail, one should have firm determination and courage from the heart. And then, with a spear like the great supreme sattva, one should pierce the Maya Rakshasi. With many simple emotions, one should churn and destroy Maya in many ways, and then control the proud Gajendra with the ankush of humility, etc. With a mace-sambil like gentleness-simplicity, one should pulverize hundreds of objects, and seeing the crocodile-fish fighting from afar, one should condemn them. Sutra - 201-205**

**Anger and pride that are not suppressed, Maya and greed that are increasing, these four aggregate kshayas cannot be rescued from excessive suffering, such shalya enters the soul, then one should overcome anger with forgiveness-pacification, conquer pride with humility, conquer Maya with simplicity, and conquer greed with contentment. In this way, having conquered the kshayas, one who has renounced the seven bhayasthanas and the eight madasthanas, is ready to receive pure criticism from the Guru. As per the defects, transgressions, and shalya that have occurred, one should present all one's bad character without doubt, without agitation, fearlessly to the Guru. As if the ghosts and spirits have surrounded him, or as if he is speaking with the simplicity of a child, one should present all the truth to the Guru, as per the shalya-paap that has occurred, and criticize oneself. Sutra - 206-207**

**Whatever has been done by entering the underworld, by going into the water, in a secret place in the house, at night or in darkness, or even with one's mother, and besides that, whatever other misdeeds have been done with others, once or repeatedly, one should tell the Guru truthfully, so that the sin may be destroyed. Sutra - 208**

**The Guru Maharaj will also tell him the atonement according to the command of the Tirthankara Paramatma, so that he may become free from shalya and avoid asanaya. Sutra - 209-210**

**Asanaya is called sin, and it has been described in many ways. It is as follows: violence, lying, stealing, sexual intercourse, possession. The five objects of the senses: sound, form, taste, smell, touch, the four kshayas: anger, pride, Maya, greed, the three dands: mind, speech, body. Without renouncing these sins, one cannot be free from shalya. Sutra - 211**

**Earth, water, fire, air, plants, these five are stationary, the sixth is the Trasa jiva, or the nine-ten or fourteen types of jivas. Or, according to the various types of bodies, one can describe the violence (of the sin of violence) of many types of jivas. Sutra - 212**

**Leaving aside the Hitopadeśa, the best and the ultimate truth-based Dharma, there are many kinds of false statements, criticize all the shalya in the form of falsehood. **

With passion-based cruel feeling, whoever speaks contaminated language, with sinful faulty words whoever replies, that should be known as false-untruthful speech. Without giving, whatever is received with dust-dirt, that is theft. Enjoyment of the subject of handcraft, words etc. that is sexual intercourse, in which there is fainting, greed, desire, possessive feeling, that is attachment, not to be gluttonous, eating to the full, that is called night-meal. Sutra-219-221

Sutra-222-224
If one does not abandon this great sin then he/she does not become free from the affliction. From this great sin, if one commits a small-subtle sin for the body then that muni does not become free from the affliction. Therefore, by revealing the sin in front of the guru, by performing the atonement given by the guru maharaj, by practicing penance free from deceit-hypocrisy-affliction, whoever is born in the realm of gods or humans, there he/she obtains excellent birth, excellent prosperity, excellent accomplishment, excellent form, excellent fortune. If in that realm accomplishment is not obtained then surely all these excellent materials are obtained. According to that, I say what I heard from the Bhagvant. Sutra-225
Here the fault of miswriting was not seen in Shruthadhar. But in the previous copy of this Sutra, somewhere the part of the verse, somewhere the word-letter, somewhere the line, somewhere three-three pages, such a lot of part of the text was diminished.

**Purpose-1 Sutra - 226-227**
_O Gautama! With all your being, remove all the obstacles and think correctly that in this world, whether it be sentient or non-sentient, a Bhavy or an Abhavy, but any soul seeking happiness, whether it be crooked, upward, downward, here or there, wanders in all ten directions._ **Sutra-228-229**
Know that there are two types of non-sentient beings: Vikalendriya, meaning those with one, two, three, or four senses, and Ekendriya, like worms, Kunthu, Mali, in that order, with two, three, or four senses. Vikalendriya beings, and earth, water, fire, air, and plants, those are the stationary Ekendriya non-sentient beings. Animals, birds, Naraki, humans, and Devas, all are sentient. And within that limit, there is Bhavyata and Abhavyata in all beings. Naraki do not have Vikalendriya or Ekendriya. **Sutra-230-231**
We also seek happiness (with such a desire), a Vikalendriya being goes to the shade when it is hot and to the warmth when it is cold. So, even there, they experience suffering. Those with very delicate bodies, their soles cannot bear even a moment of heat or a moment of cold, etc., any adversity. **Sutra-232-233**
Due to the desire for sexual pleasure and the attachment, delusion, and ignorance arising from it, those born as Ekendriya beings like earth-bodied beings, etc., do not experience suffering. Those Ekendriya beings undergo infinite transformations and some attain the state of being without senses, some do not attain it, and some attain it after an infinite period of time. **Sutra-234**
Deer, animals, birds, snakes, etc., who are defeated by cold, heat, wind, rain, etc., cannot even find peace for the time it takes for the blink of an eye, even in their dreams. **Sutra-235**
How can a Naraki, who is in hell, who experiences many pains every moment, being cut, torn, and chopped by sharp weapons like a cruel, unwanted touch, and other such hard weapons, find happiness? **Sutra-236-237**
Even in the Devaloka, where the divinity of all is equal, there is suffering when one Deva becomes a vehicle and another (more powerful) Deva mounts it. Even though their hands and feet are equal and similar, they are still unhappy. At that time, they are deluded and think, "I have lost my Bhava, damn me, I did so much penance, yet my soul was cheated. I have attained a lesser divinity." **Sutra-238-241**
In human life, those who seek happiness engage in farming, service, work, trade, and crafts, day and night. They endure the heat, what happiness do they have? Some fools are envious seeing the prosperity of others. Some poor souls cannot even satisfy their hunger. And the wealth of some people also diminishes. If there is an increase in punya, then there is an increase in fame, glory, and wealth. If punya starts to decrease, then fame, glory, and prosperity start to decrease. Some virtuous people enjoy equal happiness for a thousand years continuously, while some beings...

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Mahānishītha'

**Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number** Even on the day of their death, they depart in sorrow without experiencing happiness, because humans have abandoned the practice of virtuous deeds. Sūtra - 242

This is a brief description of the sorrow of all beings in the world. O Gautama! The sorrow that exists in the human race, listen to it briefly. Sūtra - 243

Hundreds of kinds of sorrow that are constantly felt, causing distress and boredom, some humans do not attain detachment. Sūtra - 244-245

**Briefly, humans experience two types of sorrow, one physical and the other mental. And then there are three types of each, intense, fierce, and extremely fierce. Sorrow that ends in a single moment is called intense sorrow. Sorrow that has some respite in between is called fierce sorrow. Sorrow that is endured equally at all times without respite is called extremely fierce sorrow. Sūtra - 246**

Humans experience intense sorrow. In the animal realm, there is fierce sorrow, and O Gautama! The sorrow of beings in hell is extremely fierce. Sūtra - 247

Humans experience three types of sorrow: minor, moderate, and superior. Animals do not experience minor sorrow, and beings in hell experience superior sorrow. Sūtra - 248-250

The minor sorrow experienced by humans is of two types: subtle and gross. The other, greater sorrow, is devoid of divisions. Subtle sorrow is experienced by unconscious humans, and gross sorrow by gods. Gods who are in the state of decline experience gross mental sorrow from the time of their decline. Gods who are servants and subject to orders experience gross mental sorrow from birth until the end of their life. Gods do not experience physical sorrow. Gods have a heart that is as strong as a thunderbolt, extremely powerful. Otherwise, their heart would break into a hundred pieces due to mental sorrow. Sūtra - 251-252

The remaining two types of sorrow, devoid of divisions, are moderate and superior. These types of sorrow are experienced by humans born in the womb. Those who live for countless years experience moderate sorrow, and those who live for a countable number of years experience superior sorrow. Sūtra - 253

Now, the synonyms for the word sorrow are mentioned. Unsuccessful, pain, disease, ache, sorrow, non-cessation, restlessness, aversion, distress, etc., are many synonymous words used for sorrow.

**Study-2, Purpose-2, Sūtra-254**

The two types of sorrow, physical and mental, have been described. Now, O Gautama! I will describe physical sorrow very clearly. Listen to it with concentration. Sūtra - 255-262

Even if a mere fraction of the tip of a hair touches a virtuous, pure-minded, motionless being, it causes them so much pain that if we were to be cut with a knife or pierced in the heart or head with a weapon, we would tremble.

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Chhedasūtra-5, 'Mahānishīth'

**Study/Purpose/Sūtrāṅka**

The Kunthuā, with all its parts, experiences intense pain both internally and externally from mere touch. Its body starts to tremble, and being unable to speak, it cannot express its pain. But its mental and physical suffering is immense, like a burning fire. It thinks, "What is this? I have received this heavy, painful suffering. I am taking long, hot breaths. When will this suffering end? When will I be freed? What should I do to be free from this suffering? Where should I run? What should I do to alleviate the suffering and attain happiness? Or what should I cover myself with? What should I eat?" Due to the actions of these three classes, it is trapped in the intense suffering of Mahāduḥkha. It experiences the pain up to the Saṅkhyātī Āvalikā, and thinks, "I have an itch. This itch will not subside in any way." Sūtra - 263-265

**This determined human, what does he do now? O Gautama! Listen now. If the Kunthuā's life had not gone elsewhere, he would have scratched and scratched, killing the Kunthuā's life. Or he would have rubbed his body against the wall, causing the Kunthuā's life to suffer until death. While scratching the dying Kunthuā, that human is certainly in a state of extreme Roudra Dhyāna. Consider this: if that human were to know the nature of Ārta and Roudra, then such a scratcher is a pure Ārta Dhyāna practitioner. Sūtra - 266**

He who dwells in Roudra Dhyāna binds himself to the highest Naraka Ayusha, and the Ārta Dhyāna practitioner earns misfortune, femininity, unmanliness, and animal birth. Sūtra - 267-269

The restless human, desiring to be free from the itch caused by the touch of the Kunthuā's foot, experiences the following state. He says, "My beauty is gone." He is extremely miserable, grief-stricken, anxious, empty-minded, distressed, foolish, troubled by suffering, slow, taking long breaths, agitated in mind, and due to incessant suffering, he binds himself to the appropriate karma of an inauspicious animal and hellish being, and wanders in the cycle of births. Sūtra - 270

In this way, if the soul, through the power of Kṣayopaśama, overcomes the suffering caused by the Kunthuā, and for a moment attains equanimity and does not scratch the Kunthuā's life, then consider him to have crossed the great suffering. Sūtra - 271-275

He does not harm the helpless being, but makes it happy, and therefore experiences great joy. With a healthy mind, he thinks and reflects, "I have given refuge to a being." And then he thinks, "Now I have attained liberation and peace. I have destroyed the sinful karma and suffering caused by scratching. By scratching and harming that being, I do not know whether I will enter Roudra Dhyāna or Ārta Dhyāna. By multiplying the suffering of Roudra and Ārta Dhyāna, I will reach infinite suffering. I will suffer continuously, day and night, without a moment's respite. I will suffer in hell and animal realms, like an ocean of suffering, for countless eons. At that time, my heart will become like a liquid, and I will feel as if I am being melted by the fire of suffering." Sūtra - 276

When suffering the pain caused by touching the Kunthuā, he thinks in his mind, "It would be good if this suffering were not there." But at that time, he should contemplate, "How should I count the suffering of this itch caused by the touch of the Kunthuā?"

Study/Purpose/Sūtrāṅka Sūtra-277
The pain of the touch of a Kunthuā or itching is only mentioned here as a symptom. In the world, everyone experiences pain directly. Even though they are aware of it, some beings do not know, therefore I say. Sūtra-278-279
Secondly, however, the most terrible pain is experienced by all beings in the world. O Gautama! How many pains are there to be described here? In birth after birth, only so much is spoken by the tongue, "Kill, strike," the fruit of those words alone, and the sinful karma that arises from them, I say. Sūtra-280-283
Wherever it is born, there, in many Bhava-vana, it always wanders, killing, beating, and crushing. If it breaks the limbs, eyes, ears, nose, waist, bones, etc., of any being, or of an insect, butterfly, etc., or if it approves of someone who does so, then, by the arising of that karma, it will be ground in a millstone or in such a machine, just as sesame seeds are ground. In this way, it will receive a succession of pain for one, two, three, twenty, thirty, or a hundred, a thousand, a lakh, not just a number, but until the end of Bhava. Sūtra-284-286
If, out of carelessness or ignorance, someone speaks falsely due to the fault of envy, and utters words that are unpleasant and harmful to the listener, if, out of pride in the cunning of Kāmadeva, they speak repeatedly with prejudice, or if they are called so or approve of it, if they speak falsely, unpleasantly, and harmfully out of anger, greed, fear, or laughter, then, by the arising of that karma, they will be dumb, ugly-mouthed, foolish, sick, and fruitless-spoken, in every Bhava, they will be repeatedly branded as a liar, even though they are light and small, and well-behaved. Sūtra-287
If truthful words are spoken for the benefit of the Jīvanikāya, those words are blameless, and even if they are perhaps false, the blame of falsehood does not attach. Sūtra-288
In this way, knowing the fruits of theft, etc., the loss of wealth acquired in this Bhava or in a previous birth by performing karma like farming, etc., is seen to be due to sin.
Study-2 Purpose-3 Sūtra-289-291
In the same way, some, having suffered the consequences of sexual misconduct, come into the human womb for an infinite time. Even in humanhood, some people have weak digestion, and they find it difficult to digest food. If they eat a little more food, their stomach hurts. Or they are thirsty all the time, and perhaps they die on the way. They want to speak very much, but no one sits near them, they cannot sit still in any place comfortably, they sit with difficulty, even if they find a place, they do not find any welcome because they are devoid of art and science, that poor soul cannot even sleep. Sūtra-292-293
In this way, due to the fault of attachment and beginning, they are bound to the life of hell, and they suffer the intense pain of hell for the duration of the thirty-three Sagaropama. No matter how much they are satisfied, they are not satisfied even after eating that much food, just as a traveler does not find peace, in the same way, this poor soul is not satisfied even after eating.

Study/Purpose/Sūtrāṅka Sūtra- 294-295
Due to the faults of kṣaya like anger, etc., having obtained the poison of sight, serpent poison, and the poison of sight, and then practicing fierce meditation, one becomes a mithyādrṣṭi. The mithyādrṣṭi, while in the human state, being cunning, deceitful, scheming, and pretentious, for a long time, showing their importance to people, while deceiving them, obtained the state of a tiryañc. Sūtra-296-298
Here too, they become the recipient of many diseases, sorrows, and grief. Overwhelmed by poverty and distress, they are hated by many. Due to the faults of the arising of their karma, they are always anxious, their bodies are weak, and they are always burning with the flames of envy and sorrow. Such ignorant, childish beings are harassed by many sorrows. The fault lies in their bad character. Therefore, who should they be angry with? Sūtra - 299-300
In this way, by breaking vows and rules, by breaking one's character, by indulging in unrestraint, by practicing the false path of utsūtraprūpaṇā, by acting contrary to the commands of the Lord in many ways, by indulging in careless conduct, by doing something with the mind, or something with speech, or something with the body alone, by causing it to be done, and by approving it, the fault arises from the careless conduct of the mind, speech, and body. Sūtra-301
This fault that arises cannot be purified without proper condemnation, reproach, criticism, pratikramṇa, and atonement. Sūtra - 302
While remaining with the śalya, for countless times, in the womb, for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 months, their bones, hands, feet, and head do not form, even before that, they dissolve within the womb, meaning the womb melts away. Sūtra-303-306
Despite obtaining human birth, they become afflicted with leprosy, tuberculosis, etc., even while alive, they have worms in their body. Many flies sit on their body, buzz and fly, all parts of their body always rot, their bones become weak, etc., they are overwhelmed by such sorrows, they become extremely shy, bad, and contemptible, causing anxiety to many people, they cause unwanted anxiety to their close relatives and friends. Due to such a particular result of determination, they obtain the state of a ghost or a demon due to the lack of desire and the exhaustion of karma. Due to the śalya of the previous birth, due to such a particular determination, they are thrown far away in all ten directions by the karma earned in many births, where food and water are difficult to obtain, where even breathing is not possible, they are born in such a desolate forest. Sūtra-307-309
Or they are born as earthworms, attached to each other's limbs, confused in intoxication, not knowing when the sun rises and sets. They experience the state of existence and the state of the body as earthworms there, and then they obtain humanity, but they are born as eunuchs. Being eunuchs, they bear the extremely cruel, terrible, and fierce consequences, and due to the wind of those consequences, they burn, fall, and die, and after death, they are born in the state of a plant. Sūtra - 310-313
Having obtained the state of a plant, they spend countless eons with their feet up and their mouth down, unable to obtain the state of being without senses. After experiencing the state of existence and the state of the body as a plant, they later obtain the state of one, two, three, four, (five) senses.

If due to the fault of Pāpaśalya, one is born in the realm of Tiryancha, even then one experiences the births of Mahāmātsya, predatory birds, bulls like Saṇḍha, lions, etc. There, due to the special consequence of extremely cruel actions like eating meat, killing five-sense beings, etc., one descends deeper and deeper, even reaching the seventh Naraka. Sūtra-314-315

There, after experiencing such great and terrible suffering for a long time, one is born again in the realm of cruel Tiryancha, performs cruel actions, and returns to Naraka. In this way, one experiences the cycle of birth in Naraka and Tiryancha, experiencing various kinds of great suffering. Even after crores of years, one would not have the strength to describe the suffering. Sūtra-316-318

After that, one experiences births as donkeys, camels, bulls, etc., carrying loads, bearing burdens, enduring the pain of being hit with spiked wood, getting stuck in mud while carrying loads, enduring the suffering of heat, cold, and rain, being killed, bound, having ears and noses pierced for marking, being branded, enduring insults, being yoked and forced to walk together, being beaten with whips, goads, etc., constantly experiencing terrible suffering, day and night, throughout life. One experiences this and many other groups of suffering for a long time, and while suffering, with a tormented mind, one barely gives up the breath. Sūtra-319-323

Then, due to some special auspicious determination, one may attain human birth. But even after becoming a human, due to the fault of the previous Śalya, one is born poor. There, one is surrounded by diseases like leprosy, scabies, etc., and everyone considers it auspicious to not see them. One's heart burns with the strong desire to seize the wealth of others. One dies without achieving success in life. Relying on special determination, one may wander in the realm of stationary beings like earth, or in the realm of two, three, four, or five-sense beings, experiencing such extremely fierce, terrible, and great suffering. (O Gautama!) That being wanders, experiencing unbearable pain in all four realms of existence, and experiences the birth and body condition in the realm of snakes. Sūtra-324

One who has consumed Śalya or the fault of sin in a previous birth, due to that, wanders in all four realms, experiencing birth in each realm, various diseases, pain, suffering, sorrow, poverty, distress, false accusations, the suffering of being in the womb, etc., like burning in fire. That unfortunate being cannot attain the state of Nirvāṇa, the proper joy of the great festival, the power of Samarthya Yoga, the liberation-bestowing chariot of eighteen thousand Śīlāṅga, the destruction of all sins and eight types of karma, the characteristics of non-violence, the state of being free from attachment, the all-knowing Dharma, and the state of Bodhi Samyaktvā. Sūtra-325-327

Relying on special consequences, a soul may attain Bodhi after a long time, after countless transformations of Pudgala. Such a rare Bodhi Ratna, which destroys all suffering, is attained with great difficulty. One who becomes negligent after attaining such a Bodhi Ratna, returns to the same realm, in the same order, on the same path, and experiences the same suffering. Sūtra-328-329

In that way, one experiences the transformation of all Pudgala, all Paryāya, all Varṇāntara, all Gandha, Rūpa, Rasa, Sparśa, and Saṃsthāna, in one's own body form. One experiences the transformation of Bhavasthiti and Kāyasthiti, and all the states of existence in the world.

Whether one attains enlightenment or not by the time of the cessation of the reflection of pudgala. Sūtra- 330-331

**Translation**

Thus, one who breaks the vows and rules, neglects those who break the vows and rules, does not stabilize them, breaks the conduct, neglects those who break the conduct, violates the restraint or neglects those who violate the restraint, promotes the wrong path and does not stop doing so, practices the wrong path and does not stop it even when capable or neglects it, all of them wander through the four realms of existence in the order described above. Sūtra - 332-333

If the person in front of you becomes angry or pleased, talks about death after consuming poison or expresses fear, even then, always speak in a way that benefits your own side, speak in a way that benefits yourself or others, such a person who speaks beneficial words attains enlightenment or purifies the enlightenment they have already attained. Sūtra - 334-335

Living beings with open āśrava doors are lubricated by karma due to their nature, state, region, and taste. How can such a soul, trapped in the eight severe karmas, be freed from suffering? Without practicing severe austerities, they cannot be freed from the karma they have created without repenting for their past misdeeds. Sūtra-336-337

Except for the Siddha soul, the incompetent, and those who remain in the state of Śaileśīkaraṇa, all worldly souls bind karma every moment. There is no living being without karma binding. Through good intentions, one binds good karma, through bad intentions, one binds bad karma, through intense results, one acquires karma with intense taste and state, and through weak results, one acquires karma with weak taste and state. Sūtra - 338

The amount of karma that is accumulated by gathering all the sinful karmas is multiplied by countless times, and the amount of karma that is accumulated by breaking the conduct and restraint of austerities and restraint, by promoting the wrong path, by practicing the wrong path, and by worshipping it. Sūtra - 339

If all giving and other actions are performed for the benefit of oneself and others, even the heavy, dense, and impenetrable mass of infinite, great, and heavy sinful karma will be destroyed. By practicing restraint and austerities, all sinful karma accumulated over a long period of time is destroyed. Sūtra-340-344

If the āśrava doors are bound with the purity of samyaktva, and one remains vigilant there, then one should bind less there and perform a lot of nirjarā. When the āśrava doors are bound, one should not break the commands of the Lord and remain firm in knowledge, vision, and conduct, then one should exhaust all the karma bound before and bind karma with a weak state. Even those karmas that have not yet arisen should be eradicated by enduring severe hardships and then achieving victory over karma. In this way, by stopping the cause of āśrava, by abandoning all desires, by engaging in self-study, meditation, and yoga, and then by immersing oneself in the austerities of patience and heroism, one should practice complete restraint with mind, speech, and body, then one will not bind superior karma and will perform infinite nirjarā of karma.

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Chhedasūtra-5, 'Mahānishīth'

Study/Purpose/Sūtrāṅka: Fear arises, by blocking the Āśrava door, remaining in Kṣamādi Yati Dharma and Yamaniyamadi, ascending in the category of Śukla Dhyāna, attaining Śaileśīkaraṇa, then burning and incinerating all the karma bound for a long time, not binding new minor karma. In the fire of Dhyāna Yoga, five short syllables are spoken, in that short time, burning and reducing to ashes all the karma that remains until Bhava. Sūtra - 349-350

Thus, the Jīva, by the power and strength of Yoga, completely freed from the armor of Karma Kalanka by tradition, at one time attains eternal, pain-free, disease, old age, and death-free, where sorrow or poverty is never seen. Always experiencing joy, such a blissful Śivālaya-Moksha sthāna is attained. Sūtra-351-353

O Gautama! There are also such Jīvas who, even after binding the Āśrava door and attaining Kṣamādi Daśavidha Samyama sthāna, etc., experience mixed joy and sorrow. Therefore, until all eight Karmas are completely eradicated by intense penance and restraint, the Jīva cannot experience happiness even in dreams. In this world, all Jīvas continuously suffer without rest. There is not a single moment when this Jīva has endured the pain that has come to it with equanimity. Sūtra-354-355

How big is the body of a Kunthuā Jīva? O Gautama! If you think - smaller than the smallest, even smaller than that, even much smaller than that, in it is Kunthu, how big is its foot? The foot's edge is only a very small part, even if that part touches our body or goes on someone's body, it will not cause us pain. Even if you collect millions of Kunthuā bodies and weigh them on a small scale, they will not even make a pal (milligram), then how big is the body of one Kunthuā? We cannot bear the touch of the edge of the foot of such a small Kunthuā, and Jīvas endure such a state as described above when they touch the foot's edge. O Gautama! Listen to what kind of feeling should be held during such pain. Sūtra - 356-365

A small animal like a Kunthuā may roam, move, and walk on my unclean body, but I will not destroy it by scratching, but protect it. It will not always be here. Perhaps it will leave in the next moment, it will not be here in the next moment. Perhaps it will not leave in the next moment, then O Gautama! This is how one should feel, this Kunthuā is not attached to me with attachment or hatred towards me, it does not touch me with anger, envy, jealousy, hatred, or a desire to play. Kunthuā does not climb on anyone's body out of hatred. It climbs on anyone's body like that. It may be disabled, a child, another animal, or enter burning fire and well water. It never thinks that this is my former enemy or my relative, therefore the soul should think that this is the rise of my Āśātanā-Pāpa. What kind of sorrow of Āśātanā have I done to this Jīva? This is moving around my body in all directions, oblique, upward, downward, and in all directions, for the benefit of my soul, to experience the fruits of the sinful deeds done in the previous birth or to end that pool of sin. I will endure this pain with equanimity, then my sinful deeds will end.

Perhaps the Kunthuā is caught by a strong wind while roaming on the body, then the Kunthuā experiences unbearable physical pain and the great pain of Raudra and Ārtadhyāna increases. At such a time, think that even a little pain from the touch of this Kunthuā, you cannot bear it and go into Ārta Raudra Dhyāna, then due to that pain, you will start Śalya, and you will have to endure its fruits for a long time, being Śalyavāla in Manoyoga, Vachanayoga, Kāyayoga, time, Āvalikā, Muhurta. How will you be able to bear such pain at that time?

How will that suffering be? You will have to endure many births and rebirths, in the four states of existence and 84 lakh species, enduring constant, intense, terrifying suffering every moment of the day and night - Alas! - You will have to lament like "He is dead!" Sutra-367
In the hellish and animal realms, there is no protector or refuge. The poor soul is alone, with no one to help their body, and they have to suffer the bitter and harsh fruits of their sins. Sutra-368
If a hell-being goes to a forest of trees with leaves like the edge of a sword, seeking shade, the wind will blow the leaves onto their body, causing it to be cut to pieces. They will drown in the Vaitarani river, which is full of blood, pus, fat, and hair, and has a foul odor. They will be ground in a mill, cut limb from limb, embraced by thorny salmali trees, cooked in a pot, and beaten by the beaks of crows and other birds. They will suffer the pain of being chewed by lions and other animals, and many other sufferings, all while being under the control of others. Sutra-369-370
Animals will have their noses and ears pierced, be slaughtered, bound, and tormented. Their flesh will be cut, their skin will be peeled, they will be forced to pull carts and plows, carry heavy loads, and be yoked with sharp plows. They will suffer from hunger and thirst, have nails hammered into their feet, be bound and branded with weapons, and have burning substances applied to their eyes. They will endure many other cruel sufferings, all while being under the control of others. Sutra-371
You are not able to bear the itching caused by the touch of a worm's foot, so how will you be able to bear the extremely terrifying suffering of hell and the animal realm, which is far greater? Sutra-372-375
What is the difference between the suffering of hell and the animal realm, and the suffering caused by the touch of a worm's foot? It is said that even if you multiply the atoms of Mount Meru by infinity, it would still not be equal to the suffering caused by the touch of a worm's foot. These beings have been longing for happiness for a long time within the cycle of birth and death, but they only find suffering. And then, remembering the suffering of the past, they become even more miserable. Thus, the living being is trapped in this world, full of countless sufferings and calamities. If they suddenly attain the middle path, they will not let go of the happiness they have found, but... the soul that does not understand the difference between what is right and wrong, what is to be done and what is not to be done, what is beneficial and what is harmful, what is to be served and what is not to be served, and what is to be practiced and what is not to be practiced (does not know right and wrong), what will be the state of that poor soul in the future? Sutra-376
Therefore, having heard this truth, one who wishes to end suffering should renounce women, possessions, and attachments, and cultivate self-control and austerity. Sutra-377-384
Even if a woman is sitting on a separate seat, sleeping, turning her face away, wearing ornaments or not, not present in person but depicted in a picture, looking at her with carelessness will attract the weak human being. That is, one cannot help but feel attachment upon seeing her. Therefore, just as one should immediately avert their gaze when seeing the midday sun in the summer, one should immediately avert their gaze when seeing a woman depicted in a painting or a beautifully adorned woman.

Agam Sutra 39, Chedasutra-5, 'Mahanisitha'

A brahmacharini should avoid a woman whose eyes, nose, or lips have been pierced, whose body is ravaged by leprosy, or who is afflicted by other diseases. One should also avoid an elderly wife, a young woman whose youthful charms are fading, an unmarried woman of advanced age, a woman whose husband has gone abroad, a young widow, a woman from the inner quarters, a nun who preaches the heretical doctrine of self-indulgence, a prostitute, or a eunuch. Not only these, but also animals like dogs, buffaloes, cows, donkeys, mules, goats, sheep, and even stone statues of women, adulterous women, and women afflicted from birth - all such women, whether known or unknown, who come and go at night or live in secluded places, should be completely avoided by a brahmacharini.

Sutra 385

O Gautama! One should not converse or associate with them on the path. Nor should one engage in even brief conversations with other women. One should not walk with them.

Sutra 386

O Venerable One! Should one not look at a woman at all? O Gautama! No, one should not look at or see a woman, whether she is adorned with clothes and ornaments or not. O Venerable One! Should one not even converse with women? O Gautama! No, one should not converse with a woman. O Venerable One! Should one not even stay with a woman for a moment? O Gautama! No, one should not stay with a woman even for a moment. O Venerable One! Can one walk on the path with a woman? - O Gautama! A brahmacharini cannot walk on the path alone with a woman.

Sutra 387

O Venerable One! Why do you say that one should not look at a woman's sensitive parts, not talk to her, not stay with her, and not walk with her alone? O Gautama! All women are highly excited by intense passion and desire for sensual pleasures. Their sexual desire is always burning. Their fickle mind is constantly running towards sensual objects. Their heart is always pained by the fire of desire, and they constantly pray for sensual pleasures in all directions. Therefore, they are always eager to fulfill the resolve and desire of a man.

Therefore, whether the one who sings with a melodious voice is handsome or ugly, young or old, seen before or unseen, endowed with supernatural powers or not, has recently gained prosperity or not, is satiated with sensual pleasures or desirous of them, has an old body or a strong body, is of great virtue or of low virtue, is of great valor or a coward, is an ascetic or a householder, is a brahmin or an outcast, of low or high caste - by using the faculties of hearing, sight, taste, smell, and touch, she will immediately become focused on acquiring the object of desire. Becoming focused, her mind will shine.

And then she will be in doubt whether she will get it or not. After that, perspiration will break out on her body. After that, there will be harm in this world and the next due to such inauspicious thoughts. The karmic results of that, more or less, will have to be experienced by her. When that thought goes out of her mind, she abandons shame, fear, infamy, disgrace, and propriety, and sits down from a higher place to a lower place. The more she expects a lighter result from that woman, the more countless time periods and aeons pass.

In those countless time periods and aeons, the state of karma from the first time, the second time, the third time, and so on, up to countless, infinite time periods.

Agam Sutra 39, Cheda Sutra-5, 'Mahanisitha'

The study/purpose/sutra number progresses sequentially. Then, in the future, it accumulates the state of karmas with innumerable, infinite, and endless qualities. Until the complete cycle of ascent (utsarpini) and descent (avasarpini) is over, it acquires the excellent karmic state for both the infernal and the animal gati (state of existence). In this way, through the yogas (activities) of feminine thoughts and so on, it has to undergo the cycle of ascent and descent for crores and lakhs of times, and acquire the appropriate karmic state for the infernal and animal existence.

After coming out from there, it describes the conditions to be faced in the next life. By looking at or having lust for a woman, it becomes ugly in appearance, dark-bodied, devoid of luster and charm, and the luster that gets destroyed is inauspicious. Then, on seeing it, others also get agitated.

Its sense of touch becomes dull. Thereafter, its eyes and limbs become reddish due to lustful attachment. The eyes become reddish towards the opposite sex. In some, the two eyes become reddish and intoxicated due to lust.

Due to the blindness of lust, it does not consider the extremely grave faults, the breach of the vow of brahmacharya, the violation of rules, the commission of extremely grave and terrible sinful acts, the destruction of morality. It does not care about the fear of the infernal world, which is like a deep darkness. It forgets the self, its karmas, and its spiritual stages. It does not care even for the unviolable command of the entire universe, including the gods and the asuras. It will have to undergo the cycle of 84 lakh species and the endless series of births, which it forgets. Even the moment that is less than half an eyelid is devoid of happiness, and there is only absolute suffering in the four gatis (states of existence). It does not see what is worth seeing and sees what is not worth seeing.

The entire community is gathered. Even though the effulgent rays of the sun have spread in all ten directions, illuminating the one sitting, standing, lying on the ground, sleeping or walking, and visible to all, it thinks as if there is total darkness in all directions. Blinded by passion and lust, it does not realize that it is seen and known by everyone. While it has committed the extremely grave faults of vow-breaking, moral destruction, violation of restraint, fear of the next world, transgression of command, and the fear of wandering in the cycle of existence for endless time, it does not see or care about them. It sees what is not worth seeing.

The one whose extraordinary fortune has completely vanished, with a drooping face and reddish complexion, becomes faded, unsightly, not worth seeing, and with a lotus-like face. At that time, it suffers a lot. Then, its lotus-like parts, hips, thighs, waist, arms, chest, and neck gradually become manifest. Thereafter, they make the hidden and exposed parts lustful. All its limbs and parts are pierced and shattered by the arrows of Cupid. The entire body is covered with goosebumps, and the bodily elements become unstable to the extent that the body is pierced by the arrows of Cupid. Then, the buttocks, thighs, and arms are tormented by the arrows of Cupid. The control over the body is not self-dependent. It can bear the great hardship of the hips and the body.

And while doing so, it cannot recognize or understand the condition of its own bodily state. After attaining such a state, within twelve breaths, it becomes motionless. The breathing becomes irregular. Then, it takes slow breaths.

In this way, it experiences such a strange state due to the effort of lust. And it is as if some male or female is possessed by a demonic influence. Just as a cunning demon has entered the body, the woman afflicted by lust may also speak incoherent words, wander in the turbulent ocean of lust, and utter words that arouse infatuation, looking at or not looking at the youthful or elderly, powerful or weak male.

The one who, with the intention of lust, fearfully and shrinkingly invites a person of low character, a virtuous person, or any other condemned, inferior, and low-born person, calls that person with a passionate voice and a sidelong glance, and observes him with attachment.

At that time, he may acquire meritorious or demeritorious karmas of the highest degree, lasting for countless descending and ascending cycles of time, i.e., millions and billions of years, but he does not bind those karmas. Now, at the time when he is about to touch the limbs of that person, he binds the state of those karmas, but he does not make them manifest. Sutra - 388

O Gautama! Now, the person who, being under the influence of association, engages in sexual activity with that woman and indulges in sensual pleasures under her influence, is unfortunate. The decision to engage in or abstain from association lies with the man. Therefore, the excellent person who is not under the influence of association is fortunate. Sutra - 389

O Venerable One! Why is it said that the person who does not engage in sexual activity with that woman is fortunate, and the one who does is unfortunate? O Gautama! If that sinful woman, whose karmas have reached the state of being bound and manifested, associates with a man, then those karmas become more intense, i.e., the wretched woman, by obtaining such a course of action from the bound and manifested karmas, wanders endlessly in the state of a single-sensed being, such as an earth-bodied organism, but does not attain the state of a two-sensed being. In this way, after enduring great suffering for countless eons, they exhaust the karmas of the single-sensed state and, by performing karmas, perhaps attain the state of a human being with five senses, but still end up obtaining a female birth, which is inauspicious.

They are born as eunuchs and then have to undergo innumerable sufferings in the animal realm, where there is always lamentation, and where they do not find any refuge, not even in their dreams. Constantly experiencing torment and anxiety, devoid of relatives, kinsmen, and friends, they perform condemnable, censurable, blameworthy, and despicable karmas, praising many people, pleading with sweet words, and hearing words of their defeat, barely managing to sustain their lives, and wandering in the four gatis (realms of existence).

O Gautama! Understand this further: the sinful woman who has acquired bound, manifested, and intensified karmic state, and the man who desires her, both acquire an infinite number of such karmic states, which are even more superior or supreme than hers. This is why, O Gautama, it is said that the person who does not associate with her is fortunate, and the one who does is unfortunate. Sutra - 390

O Venerable One! How many types of persons are there, about whom you speak in this way? O Gautama! Six types of persons are described: 1. the most inferior, 2. the inferior, 3. the mediocre, 4. the excellent, 5. the most excellent, and 6. the supreme. Sutra - 391

Among them, the one called the supreme person, even if he were to make a woman with excellent physical features, youthful age, and supreme beauty and grace sit on his lap for a hundred years due to compulsion, would not desire her. And the one described as the most excellent person would not desire the woman at all. However, he may have a momentary desire, but in the next moment, he would restrain his mind and condemn his own soul, but would not desire the woman in that birth again.

Translated by Muni Deepratan Sagar from the Mahanisitha Agam Sutra (Hindi translation).

And then, the man of the highest kind, upon seeing a woman who desires, may desire her in his mind for a moment or a Muhurta, but he shall not engage in improper conduct with her for a Pahora or half a Pahora. Sūtra-393
If that man is a Brahmachari or has renounced Abhigraha, or if he is not a Brahmachari or has not renounced Abhigraha, then he shall not be intensely desirous in the enjoyment of the act of understanding Bhajana-Vikalpa in relation to his wife. O Gautama! This man shall be bound by karma, but he shall not bind himself to the proper karma of wandering in the infinite world. Sūtra-394
And then, the man of the middle kind shall engage in conduct with his wife in this way, but he shall not engage in such improper conduct with another woman. But if such a man is not a fierce Brahmachari from behind, then he shall become an Ananta Samsari, or he shall not. Who shall not become an Ananta Samsari? It is said that the Bhavyātmā, who knows the nine Tattvas, including Jīva, shall not become an Ananta Samsari. According to the Āgama and other scriptures, the Uttama Sadhu Bhagavant, who is a benefactor in Dharma, who gives donations of food and other things, who practices the four kinds of Dharma, namely Dana, Shīla, Tapa, and Bhavana, to the best of his ability, who does not break the rules and vows he has taken, even in any kind of difficulty, shall, while experiencing the consequences of his actions, become a Uttama Manavata or Uttama Devapana in the tradition, and then, without falling from Samyak Tv, shall become a Nisarga Samyak Tv, or, through Abhigami Samyak Tv, shall gradually acquire eighteen thousand Shīlaangas, bind the Āshrava Dwār, become free from Karma Raj and Papa Mala, consume the Papa Karma, and attain Siddha Gati. Sūtra-395
The Adhama man shall be attached to his own or another woman, with a mind that is cruel in its consequences, and shall be engrossed in the beginning and acquisition, etc. And then, the Adhama Adhama man shall desire every woman with his mind, speech, and body, in all three ways, at all times. And he shall be engrossed in the beginning and acquisition, with a mind that is intensely cruel in its consequences, and shall spend his lifespan in this way. Thus, understand the Ananta Samsari nature of both the Adhama and the Adhama Adhama. Sūtra-396
O Bhagavant! You have explained the Ananta Samsari nature of both the Adhama and the Adhama Adhama in the same way, so what is the difference between an Adhama and an Adhama Adhama? O Gautama! The Adhama man, even though he is attached to his own or another woman, has a mind that is cruel in its consequences, and is engrossed in the beginning and acquisition, shall not engage in improper conduct with a Dīkshita Sadhvī, who desires to protect Shīla, even if he comes into contact with her, even if he demands, inspires, invites, or requests improper conduct, because he is driven by desire.
But the Adhama Adhama man shall engage in improper physical conduct with his mother, sister, etc., or even with a Dīkshita Sadhvī. Because of this, he is called an Adhama Adhama man who commits great sins. O Gautama! This is the difference between the two. And then, the Adhama man can attain Bodhi after an infinite period of time. But the Adhama Adhama man, who commits great sins and engages in improper conduct with a Dīkshita Sadhvī, even if he wanders in the infinite world for an infinite number of times, shall not become eligible to attain Bodhi. Consider this to be a difficult distinction.

Study/Purpose/Sutra Number Sutra - 397
- Among these six persons, consider the one who has attained the state of a Chadmastha Vitaraga (a householder who has attained the state of detachment) as the most superior. He should be known as the one who possesses the qualities of an Uttamottama Purusha (the most superior person), such as being devoid of psychic powers, and being an Upashamaka (one who has subdued passions) and Ksapaka (one who has destroyed karmas) Muni (ascetic). And then, consider the one who is an Apramatta Muni (vigilant ascetic) as the superior one. Thus, the description of these persons is given.  Sutra - 398
And then, the one who, being a Mithyadristi (one with wrong belief), practices severe celibacy, abandoning violence, initiation, and possession, is a Mithyadristi, not a Samyagdristi (one with right belief). They do not have the knowledge of the existence of the nine substances (Jiva, etc.). They do not appreciate or praise the ultimate goal of liberation, but they renounce sins like violence, celibacy, etc., and attain celestial maidens in the next life through austerities and celibacy, out of the desire to obtain worldly pleasures. Sutra - 399
The Vimaddhyama Purusha (the mediocre person) is the one who, adopting such an attitude, practices the vows of a Shravaka (lay follower). Sutra - 400
And the Adhama and Adhamaadhama (the inferior and the most inferior) are the ones who, in solitude, engage in the acquisition of karmic status, just as it was said for women. The only special consideration for men is that men tend to develop more attachment towards the upper parts of the female body, such as the breasts and face, compared to the genital area. Thus, the six types of persons are described. Sutra - 401
O Gautama! Some women are Bhavya (worthy) and possess firm right faith. If one contemplates their superiority, they can be considered in the category of the most superior persons. But not all women are like that. Sutra - 402
O Gautama! Similarly, there are women who do not attain the company of a man in the three time periods (past, present, and future). Despite the availability of a male partner, they do not engage in sexual activity even in the thirteenth, fourteenth, or fifteenth time periods. Just as when a fire is ignited in a village, town, or forest filled with firewood and is fanned by a strong wind, the fire becomes highly intense. After a long time, the fire subsides on its own. Similarly, O Gautama! the fire of passion in a woman becomes intense and grows, but in the fourth time period, it becomes calm, just as the flame of a lamp becomes invisible, but if oil is added, it flares up again on its own. Similarly, a woman becomes excited by the sight of a man, his conversation, his attraction, his pride, and his passion, and her fire of passion is rekindled. Sutra - 403
O Gautama! If, at such a time, that woman endures the pain of passion due to fear, shame, the blemish of her family's reputation, faith in religion, and does not engage in improper conduct, then she is blessed, meritorious, worthy of veneration, worshipful, worthy of sight, possessing all auspicious qualities, the repository of all welfare, the most auspicious treasure, the goddess of learning, the pure goddess, the indestructible goddess, the queen of gods, the most pure and superior one, worthy of being addressed as the eternal, auspicious, and liberated state. Sutra - 404
If that woman does not endure the pain and engages in improper conduct, then she is inauspicious, devoid of merit, unworthy of veneration, unworthy of worship, not worth seeing, without any auspicious qualities, the cause of all inauspiciousness and misfortune, devoid of virtue, and deserving of condemnation.

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

Study/Purpose/Sutra Number Corruption, hatred, despicable, sinful, most sinful among sinners, impure. O Gautam! A woman, with cleverness, fear, cowardice, greed, madness, lust, pride, dependence, rape, knowingly corrupts herself in restraint and virtue. Stay away from a woman who engages in improper conduct without abandoning her attire, repeatedly desires to be enjoyed by a man, and plays with a man, on the path of the road, in the village, in the city, in the capital. According to what is said further, she is not even worthy of being seen.

Similarly, if a sadhu sees such a woman, then with madness, pride, lust, dependence, willingly, knowingly, without fear of sin, an Acharya, an ordinary sadhu, a king praised, one who has gained wind, one who has gained penance, one who has gained yoga, one who has gained knowledge, a leader of the age, a preacher who influences, such a Muni, if he engages in sexual play with another woman, desires her, wants to enjoy her, or enjoys her, repeatedly enjoys her, or engages in conduct that is not worthy of being done with excessive attachment, then that Muni is extremely wicked, insignificant, of small character, unworthy, not to be worshipped, not to be seen, harmful, unrefined, inauspicious, not auspicious, blameworthy, censurable, hateful, despicable. He is a sinner, and among sinners, he is a great sinner, he is a very great sinner, of corrupt character, one who is extremely corrupt in virtue, one who performs great sinful karma.

Therefore, when he is ready to perform atonement, he experiences the state of Samadhi-death in the best way, like a horse of the low caste, who has the power of Vajra-Rishabha-Narachan-Sanghyan, who has excellent prowess, excellent character, knowledge of the best principles, excellent strength and ability, excellent combination, excellent faith in Dharma, while performing atonement. O Gautam! Such virtuous sadhus, who avoid the eighteen sinful places, who follow the secrecy of the nine Brahmacharyas, are described in the scriptures as having such qualities. Sutra-405

O Bhagavan! Is there purification through atonement? O Gautam! Some people are purified, and some are not. O Bhagavan! Why do you say that one is purified and one is not? O Gautam! If a man is of the nature of Maya, arrogance, deceit, cheating, of crooked conduct, he performs atonement while remaining with a soul full of thorns. Therefore, their inner consciousness is not purified, and they have a polluted intention. Therefore, they are not purified. Some souls are simple, who, in the same way that they have been blamed, truly request the Guru. Therefore, they are free from thorns, free from doubt, with a completely pure heart, they accept open criticism, and perform atonement with the right attitude. They are purified with purity and freedom from impurities. Therefore, it is said that one who has a pure intention is purified, and one who has thorns cannot be purified. Sutra-406-407

O Gautam! This woman is like a downpour of wealth, like a vast expanse of land, for all the sinful deeds, all the unrighteousness of a man. She is like a mine of the mud of delusion and karma-dust, an obstacle to the path of liberation, a ladder to descend into hell, a poisonous creeper without roots, a fireless hearth, food without a cure for indigestion, a disease without a name, a swoon without consciousness, a seizure without a cause, a prison without chains, a noose without a rope, death without a cause, or sudden death. All the similes mentioned can be applied to a woman. A man should not even think about enjoying such a woman in his mind, he should not make such a determination, he should not do it with prayer, contemplation, choice, or resolution, desire, remembrance, in three ways, in three ways.

O Gautam! Just as the presiding deity of a Vidya or Mantra harms its practitioner, in the same way, a woman also harms a man and creates a stain. The Muni who resolves to kill sin, the one who...

Agama Sutra 39, Chedasutra-5, 'Mahanisitha'

Just as the touch of religion does not occur to one who resolves to perform it, so also it does not touch the one who has lapsed in conduct. If there has been a lapse in conduct, then there is no resolve for the one whose resolve is towards a woman, to undergo penance, censure, reproach. Due to not undergoing censure etc., one has to wander in the cycle of transmigration with infinite suffering. Even though the purification of penance has occurred, yet again the tendency towards lack of restraint arises due to coming into contact with them. Like the act of a great sin, direct violence, demoness-like, hated by the three worlds. Not seeing the great harm of the other world, like the abode of deep darkness of hell, always a repository of many sorrows. Even the resolve to see the limbs, parts, vital spots or the beauty and charm of a woman's form, or her sweet speech, or that which increases passion, should not be made.

Sutra 408
O Gautama! This woman is like the night of dissolution, always enveloped in the darkness of ignorance. Like lightning, she appears for a moment and then gets destroyed. Like those who attack the one who has taken refuge, she immediately devours the life of the newborn child, a great sinner. Like the waves of the saline ocean stirred by the strong wind, she is a series of various options, not staying steady in one place for one master. Just as it is very difficult to fathom the depth of the self-existent ocean, similarly it is very difficult to understand the heart full of deceit of a woman. A woman is fickle-minded like the wind, devouring like fire, greedy like a dog. Like a dog, as long as you give her something, she remains a friend, and then becomes an enemy after taking everything. Like fish in the waves of the ocean, she is affectionate as long as she is near, and forgets after going away. In this way, full of countless defects, with all limbs and parts, externally and internally, a great sinner, like shamelessness.
The woman, from whose body always emanate foul-smelling, impure, contemptible, hateful, all limbs and parts, and then if one considers from the spiritual perspective, her internal and external bodily constituents are known to be of great essence, nauseating to Kamadeva, and known to the soul after attaining detachment, the supreme and best person who well understands the nature of righteousness and unrighteousness, how can he have even a moment's desire for such a woman?

Sutra 409-410
The woman whose desire a man fulfills, in her womb, at the time of a single union of the man, nine million five-sensed living beings are destroyed. Those living beings, being extremely subtle in form, cannot be seen by the physical eyes. Therefore, it is said that one should not converse with a woman even once or repeatedly, and also not inspect her limbs or parts with attachment. As far as possible, a celibate man should not walk on the path with a woman.

Sutra 411
O Venerable One! Is it the abandonment of conversation with a woman, not seeing her limbs and parts, or the abandonment of sexual intercourse? O Gautama! Abandon both. O Venerable One! Is the abandonment of sexual intercourse alone, or the complete abandonment for life, in every way, of sexual intercourse with all conscious and unconscious objects, through mind, speech and body, the three modes? O Gautama! Abandon it in all ways.

Sutra 412
O Venerable One! If any ascetic-ascetic woman engages in sexual intercourse, should they get others to pay obeisance to them?

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

**Study/Purpose/Sutra Number** O Gautama! If any sadhu-sadhvi, through divine, human or animal association, engages in evil intentions regarding things like handcraft, etc., with a conscious mind, and indulges in sexual intercourse through mind, speech, and body, inspires others to do the same, considers those who engage in it as good, and uses artificial and natural tools to engage in three-fold sexual intercourse, or encourages or approves of it, then that sadhu-sadhvi is a bad person with terrible consequences, ugly, extremely bad, whose face is not even worth looking at, a consumer of the path of the world, far from the path of liberation, a doer of great sins, not worthy of being worshipped. Not worthy of being worshipped. Not worthy of being considered good by those who worship. Not worthy of the three types of worship, or until they attain purity through atonement, if others worship them, then do not worship them yourself.

**O Bhagvant!** What do those who worship such people attain? **O Gautama!** They become a great aspirant of the great Tirthankara Bhagvant, who possesses eighteen thousand sheelangs. And relying on the results of that aspiration, they attain endless worldly existence. **Sutra-413-415**

**O Gautama!** There are some beings who can renounce women well. They also give up sexual intercourse. Yet, they cannot give up the attachment to possessions. To the extent they have attachment to possessions, whether conscious, unconscious, or both, whether much or little, they enjoy them, to that extent they are called 'Sangwala'. A 'Sangwala' being cannot practice the three disciplines of knowledge, etc., therefore renounce possessions. **Sutra-416**

**O Gautama!** There are also beings who renounce possessions, but do not renounce 'Aarammbh', they are also called those who attain the cycle of existence. **Sutra-417**

**O Gautama!** If a being is ready to begin, and engages in actions like 'Sanghatan' etc., of a one-sensed or multi-sensed being, then **O Gautama!** Understand the type of sinful karma they bind. **Sutra-418-420**

If a senseless being is forcibly, unwillingly, for a short time, brought into contact with another being through hands, feet, or other tools like a stick, etc., or if someone causes such contact, or considers the one who does it as good, **O Gautama!** When this karma, bound in this way, arises in the being's birth, then they suffer its consequences with great distress for six months. The same karma, bound through forceful contact, is suffered for twelve years. If they suffer intense remorse, then for a thousand years, and if they suffer even more intense remorse, then for ten thousand years. If they suffer intense 'Kilamana', then for a hundred thousand years, and if they suffer even more intense 'Kilamana', then for ten lakh years, they suffer the consequences of that karma. If they die, then they suffer the pain of that karma for a crore years. Understand the same for beings with three, four, and five senses, **O Gautama!**

The destruction of a subtle earth-bodied being is called 'Alparambh' by all Kevalis. **O Gautama!** The destruction of a subtle earth-bodied being is called 'Maharambh' by all Kevalis. **Sutra-421**

**O Gautama!** In this way, intense karmas accumulate in infinite measure. The soul is bound by the karma that it initiates. **Sutra-422-423**

Those who initiate bind karmas in the bound, touched, and removed states, therefore one should renounce 'Aarammbh'. One who has renounced 'Aarammbh', which brings an end to all beings, from earth-bodied beings onwards, in all ways, is...

Study/Purpose/Sutra Number: Those who are free from birth and death, old age, all kinds of poverty and sorrow. Sutra- 424-426
O Gautam! There are also beings in the world who, even after knowing this, cannot be inclined to the worship of the right path due to their solitary, peaceful nature. A being may engage in the right path and practice severe and heroic restraint, but if he does not give up these five things that will be said to him, then the restraint he has practiced is all in vain. 1. Kusheel, 2. Oosann-Shithilpan such a difficult restrained life? They might say. 3. Yathachhandaswachhand, 4. Sabal-Dushit Charitrawale, 5. Pasattho. Do not even look at these five. Sutra-427
The path taught by the omniscient Bhagvant destroys all sorrow. And one who is trapped in worldly pride, who practices lax conduct, and who abandons the path to liberation taught by Bhagvant. Sutra-428
Consider anyone who does not accept, does not take interest in, and contradicts even a single word or a single step taught by the omniscient Bhagvant to be a false-sighted person. Sutra-429
Knowing this, one should avoid all contact with those five, including seeing them, talking to them, recognizing them, living with them, etc., by all means for the sake of welfare and well-being. Sutra-430
O Bhagvant! You forbid seeing the corrupt in conduct, and then you give them atonement. How can these two things be compatible? Sutra-431
O Gautam! It is very difficult for a corrupt soul to cross the ocean of the world. Therefore, such a soul is certainly given atonement out of compassion. Sutra-432
O Bhagvant! Does atonement break the bondage of hell? O Gautam! Even after doing atonement, many souls have gone to hell. Sutra-433-434
O Gautam! Souls who have earned an infinite world certainly destroy it through atonement, then why don't they break the age of hell? In this abode, nothing is impossible with atonement. Except for one Bodhilabh, nothing is impossible for a being with atonement. Once Bodhilabh is lost, it is difficult to get it back. Sutra-435-436
Apkay Paribhog, Agnigay Aarambh and Mithun Sevan are the ones who bind the Abodhi Labh-Karma, therefore, one should avoid them. Restrained souls should strive to abandon Mithun, Apkay, and Agnigay, which bind Abodhi. Sutra-437
O Bhagvant! If Abodhi Labh happens from the above-mentioned actions, then those householders are always inclined towards such actions. Should they be considered to have failed in adopting Shikshavrata, Gunavrata and Anuvrata?

Study/Purpose/Sutra Number - 438-443

O Gautam! The path to liberation is said to be of two kinds. One is of the Uttama Shraman and the other is of the Uttama Shravak. The first is of the Mahavrata-dhari and the second is of the Anuvrata-dhari. The Sadhus have renounced all sinful activities for life, through the three-fold threefold. The Shraman has accepted the severe Mahavrata, which is the means to liberation. The Grihastha has renounced the three-fold, two-fold, or one-fold grossness for a limited time, meaning the Shravak accepts the vows from the country. While the Sadhus have renounced the three-fold threefold of Moksha, Iccha, Aarambh, and Parigraha. They have donned the Ling-chinha or the attire of the Jineshwara, having renounced sins. When the Grihastha serves the Shraman without renouncing Iccha, Aarambh, and Parigraha, and without donning the attire of the Jineshwara, remaining attached to his wife, then O Gautam! The Grihastha observes the vow of renouncing sins from the country, therefore, his path does not have hope. Sutra-444-445

Those who have renounced all sins, have adopted the five Mahavrata, and have accepted the attire of the Lord, if they do not renounce Mithuna, Apkay, and Agnikai, then they are said to have great hope. For the same reason, the Jineshwara say that these three have great hope. Therefore, do not even desire to consume these three in your mind. Sutra-446-447

O Gautam! It has been said with great determination that the Yati binds the karma of Abodhilaabh, and the Grihastha does not bind Abodhilaabh. And then the restrained Muni binds the Abodhilaabh karma with these three intentions: 1. Violation of command, 2. Breaking of vows, and 3. Deviation from the right path. Sutra-448

Mithuna, Apkay, and Teukaay, the consumption of these three leads to Abodhik Laabh. Therefore, the Muni should strive to completely renounce these three. Sutra-449

The soul that consumes atonement and holds on to the afflictions in the mind, and then does not act according to what has been said, will go to hell. Sutra-450

O Gautam! The one who has weak faith, does not perform atonement, or if he does, he does it with a troubled mind, then should it not be considered against compassion? Sutra-451-452

O Gautam! When the kings and others fight in battle, some soldiers get injured, the arrow enters the body, then removing the arrow or performing surgery causes pain. But it is not considered against compassion to perform surgery. The one who performs surgery is not considered devoid of compassion, similarly, in the battle of the world, the removal of the internal or external arrow-like afflictions is considered unparalleled compassion by the Bhagvant. Sutra-453-455

O Bhagvant! As long as the arrow remains in the body, the being experiences pain, when the arrow is removed, he becomes happy. Similarly, the one who deceives the Tirthankara, Siddha Bhagvant, Sadhu, and Dharma, and performs any wrong conduct, becomes happy by performing atonement. He becomes happy by removing the emotional arrow, similarly, what virtue will atonement have for the soul? The poor man should act in a difficult and painful way, like...

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Mahānīśītha'
Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number Why give Prāyaścitta? Sūtra-456-457
O Gautama! When a surgical instrument is removed from the body, but the wound is not healed until ointment is applied and a bandage is tied, then the wound does not heal. Similarly, after the removal of the mental wound, this Prāyaścitta is like ointment, bandage, and tying the bandage. Just as a person is comforted by sorrow, Prāyaścitta is an infallible remedy for quickly healing the wound of sin. Sūtra-458-460
O Bhagavant! Does the Prāyaścitta mentioned by the omniscient, even in a small amount, purify all sins in practice, hearing, or knowing? O Gautama! In the summer, when one is extremely thirsty and there is extremely delicious cold water nearby, but until it is consumed, the thirst is not quenched. Similarly, knowing the Prāyaścitta, until it is practiced with sincerity, the sin increases but does not decrease. Sūtra-461
O Bhagavant! Does sin increase due to negligence? If at some point the soul becomes careful and stops committing sin, does that sin remain the same or does it stop increasing? Sūtra-462
O Gautama! Just as a snake bite occurs due to negligence, but the poison increases from behind for the one in need, so does sin increase. Sūtra-463-465
O Bhagavant! Those who know the ultimate truth, who know all the Prāyaścitta, do they also have to speak according to their actions? O Gautama! Those humans who, through mantras and spells, can revive the unconscious without surgery and without a needle, even if they are knowledgeable, become unconscious, wounded by a spear in battle, they revive others who are unconscious without surgery. Similarly, even though a virtuous sage is skilled, he should truthfully reveal his sin to another sage. Just as a disciple reveals his sin to his teacher, then he becomes pure. Similarly, to purify oneself, one should confess one's faults to others and perform Prāyaścitta according to the rules.

This third study is of such a nature that it can be explained to all four (Sadhu-Sadhvi, Shravak-Shravika). Because there are very large and very excellent Sutras and meanings worthy of being believed by command. It should be given to the appropriate disciple in the true way. Sutra-468-469
Whoever reveals it from the beginning, gives it to someone who is not well-versed, teaches it to an unchaste person, teaches it to someone who is devoid of purpose and method, will suffer the pain of madness, insanity, or long-term illness-terror, become corrupt in restraint, and not receive worship at the time of death. Sutra-470-473
Here, the first study explains the previous method. In the second study, it is said to be of this kind, and the rest of the studies are to be understood as being without method. In the second study, there are five Ayambils, and in them there are nine Uddeshas. In the third, there are eight Ayambils and seven Uddeshas. Just as it is said in the third, so also understand it in the fourth study. In the fifth study, there are six Ayambils, in the sixth, two, in the seventh, three, and in the eighth, ten Ayambils.

Those who are serious, great, intelligent, endowed with the qualities of Tapas, well-tested, and have the method of time-taking, should receive the recitation from the Vachanacharya. Sutra - 475-476
Always purify the area carefully when you do this reading. Otherwise, you will be surprised by some area deity. This is the essential and excellent essence of the Sutra, including the limbs and appendages. Just as one is cheated by taking a treasure without the proper method, so also there is an opportunity to be cheated by taking this Shruta Skandha without the proper method. Sutra-477-478
Either auspicious-beneficial actions are full of obstacles. Even in auspiciousness, there is auspiciousness, so this Shruta Skandha should be taken without obstacles. Only those who are blessed and virtuous can read it. Sutra-479
O Bhagvant! What are the characteristics of that Kushila, etc., so that one can know them well and completely abandon them? Sutra - 480-481
O Gautam! Generally, understand their characteristics in this way and completely abandon their contact. Know that there are two hundred types of Kushila, and two types of Osanna have been described. There are twenty-two types of Passathas of knowledge, etc., and three types of strong-charactered. O Gautam! Of those, the two hundred types of Kushila, I tell you first, are those whose contact corrupts the Muni in an instant. Sutra-482-484
In brief, there are two types of Kushila: 1. Parampara Kushila, 2. Aparampra Kushila. Of those, the Parampara Kushila is of two types: 1. Seven-eight Guru Parampara Kushila and 2. One, two, three Guru Parampara Kushila. And

Study/Purpose/Sutra Number from well-established knowledge, such five types of knowledge or those who possess well-established knowledge, aspiring to well-established knowledge, i.e., well-established knowledge seeker. Sutra -490

From no Agam, well-established knowledge seeker is of eight types - study well-established knowledge untimely, teach, receive well-established knowledge from disrespect, make others receive, read well-established knowledge from disrespect, read well-established knowledge without wearing any Upadhan, teach, hide the one who has read the well-established Sutra meaning, read the Sutra without vowels and consonants, with fewer letters, with more letters, teach, read the Sutra, meaning oppositely, teach. Read and teach the doubtful Sutra etc. Sutra -491

Those who read or teach well-established knowledge without wearing any Upadhan, those who approve of the reader or teacher as good, are the great sinners, aspiring to the great well-established knowledge. Sutra -492

O Bhagvant! If this is so, then should one wear the five auspicious Upadhan? O Gautam! First knowledge and then compassion, i.e., restraint, i.e., knowledge, leads to the cultivation of character and compassion. Compassion makes one see all the living beings, creatures, ghosts, and beings of the world as oneself. Seeing that all the living beings, creatures, ghosts, and beings of the world experience happiness and sorrow like oneself, one stays away from causing pain, torment, harassment, etc., to frighten, and terrify other beings. By doing so, there is no inflow of karma. By stopping the inflow of karma, the doors of inflow of karma are closed due to the same cause. By closing the doors of inflow, there is suppression of the senses and calmness in the soul.

Therefore, there is equality towards enemies and friends. From equality towards enemies and friends, there is freedom from attachment and aversion, from that, there is forgiveness, humility, simplicity, non-greed, from that, there is freedom from passions. From freedom from passions, there is right conduct. From right conduct, there is knowledge of the soul and other things. From that, there is freedom from attachment to everything. From no attachment to everything, there is destruction of ignorance, delusion, and falsehood, i.e., there is wisdom. From wisdom, there is a true understanding of what is harmful and what is beneficial, and a firm determination to attain solitary liberation.

From this, there is abandonment of what is harmful and practice of what is beneficial, one becomes very diligent in such work. After that, there is a gradual practice of the supreme Dharma, which is pure, excellent, forgiveness, etc., ten types, non-violence, and a concentrated and attached mind in practicing and making others practice. After that, i.e., the practice of the ten types of Dharma, including forgiveness, etc., and non-violence, there is concentration and attachment in the soul, there is abandonment of all attachments, which are the supreme forgiveness, supreme gentleness, supreme simplicity, supreme external wealth, gold, etc., and internal attachments, which are the form of desire, anger, etc. And there is self-absorption and supreme bliss in the practice of the twelve types of extreme, fierce, and painful austerities and vows.

Further, there is a firm determination to practice all the seventeen types of complete restraint. There is a firm determination to practice the supreme truthfulness in speech, the welfare of the six types of living beings, one's strength, vigor, effort, and prowess without hiding, and to practice the path of liberation. There is a firm determination to practice the supreme self-study, meditation, like water, to wash away the dirt of sinful karma. And then, there is the supreme non-possession, supreme purity, with all feelings, completely pure, free from all faults, with nine secrets, restrained from the eighteen places of restraint, i.e., abandoning the eighteen types of non-Brahma.

After that, there is the supreme forgiveness, humility, simplicity, non-greed, austerity, restraint, truthfulness, sorrow, non-possession, extreme firmness,

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

One who renounces all worldly beginnings with auspicious rituals like studying, purpose, and holding the Brahmavat Dharana, then renounces the beginning, commencement, and origin of the stationary beings with two, three, four, and five senses in the form of earth, water, fire, air, and plants, and the non-living body, through the three-fold of mind, speech, and body, and through the three-fold of the three-fold, renounces the four types of knowledge, namely food, etc., with the restraint of the sense objects of the ear, etc., and thus washes away sins.

Then, by holding the eighteen thousand pure Shilaangas, one becomes unshakeable, unbroken, unblemished, unchallenged, beautiful, fierce, fiercer, unique, and wondrous, and sustains the Abhigraha. Then, one endures the severe hardships and afflictions inflicted by gods, humans, and animals with equanimity. After that, one makes great efforts for the sake of the image, etc., day and night. Then, one becomes free from the clinging to the body and its impurities. With the body becoming free from regression, one attains steadiness in the white meditation.

Then, one destroys the accumulated eight types of karma from the beginningless cycle of births. One escapes from the prison of the four realms of existence and becomes free from all suffering, attaining liberation. Within liberation, there is no birth, old age, death, union with the unpleasant, separation from the pleasant, distress, anxiety, disgrace, false accusations, pain of severe illness, disease, sorrow, poverty, suffering, fear, discord, etc., forever. Then, there is absolute, ultimate, complete freedom from suffering, unchangeable, permanent, eternal, and the best happiness in liberation.

The root cause of all this happiness is knowledge. This inclination begins with knowledge. Therefore, O Gautam! One who desires absolute, ultimate, supreme, eternal, permanent, continuous, and the best happiness, should first, with respect, receive the twelve-limbed Shruta-knowledge, from the Samayik Sutra to the Lokabindu-sar, along with the method of grasping time, and should wear the Upadhana, as prescribed in the scriptures and the Tapas like Ayambil, etc., after renouncing the five, namely violence, etc., through the three-fold of the three-fold, and after performing atonement for their sins. One should understand this knowledge, which is received from the mouth of a pure Guru, with proper respect, with the correct pronunciation of vowels, consonants, matras, bindu, words, letters, without speaking more or less, without the defect of word division, in a verse-bound, sequential, previous-to-previous, subsequent-to-previous, and non-subsequent-to-previous manner, as one and only.

O Gautam! Like the vast, self-illuminated, boundless ocean without beginning and end, where one can immerse oneself in happiness, the Shruta-knowledge is the ultimate cause of all happiness. To cross this ocean of knowledge, one should bow to the chosen deity. Without bowing to the chosen deity, one cannot cross it. Therefore, O Gautam! If there is a chosen deity, it is the Navkar, which is the Panchamangal. There is no other chosen deity or auspiciousness equal to it. Therefore, it is essential to first wear the Upadhana of the Panchamangal. Sutra - 493

O Bhagavant! How should one wear the Upadhana of the Panchamangal? O Gautam! We will explain further, one should wear the Upadhana of the Panchamangal in that way.

When the time, karana, muhurta, nakshatra, yoga, lagna, and moon strength are very auspicious and beautiful, one who is free from the eight types of intoxication, has unwavering faith and devotion, whose devotion is greatly increased, who experiences great and intense joy, who has a good resolve, who has complete devotion and respect, who is free from the desire for any kind of worldly or otherworldly fruits, and who has continuously performed five fasts with the Pacchakkhana, should reside in a place free from living beings in a Jain temple, with a head full of devotion, with the body tingling with joy, with eyes like blooming lotus flowers with a hundred petals, with a calm, gentle, and steady gaze, and with waves of devotion rising in the lake of the heart.

One who experiences great and intense joy, who is free from internal darkness, who is inconceivable, supremely auspicious, and who has a special outcome, should, with the utmost respect, wear the Upadhana of the Panchamangal.

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

Those who are delighted by the study/purpose/sutra number, who grow constantly through the power of the soul, who have a joyful, pure, extremely pure, stable, unwavering inner self, who are established on the earth like the image of Shri Rishabh and other great Dharma Tirthankaras, who are established with unwavering mind and body, who are devoted, knowledgeable about the soul, have strong character, are endowed with virtues, who are gurus with a small amount of words, who perform rituals with a unique goal, whose words are spoken without hindrance to the guru's words, who have received respect, joy, compassion, and many sorrows, pains, anxieties, great illnesses, severe suffering, poverty, troubles, diseases, birth, old age, death, gestation, etc., who are like a boat in the ocean of existence filled with evil creatures (a particular type of being) and fish, who practice this entire Agam-Shastra in the middle, who are killed by the fault of falsehood, who have imagined their own weapons with a special intellect, and whose words do not contain the entire meaning, example, and reasoning.

Not only that, but they are capable of destroying the imagined words of the ignorant with reason, example, and reasoning. Such are the five auspicious great Shruta Skandha, with five studies and one Chulika, the best, presided over by the preaching deity, with three parts, one speaker, and seven letters, which reveal the infinite meaning of the path, the ultimate seed of the great mantra and the best knowledge, like 'Namo Arihantaanam'. This first study should be read with devotion. On that day, after fasting for five days, after taking the first study, on the second day, one should perform Parana with Ayambil tapas.

Similarly, on the second day, that is, the seventh day, one should read the second study, 'Namo Siddhaanam', which has two parts, one speaker, and five letters, which is said to achieve the meaning described above, which is endowed with many extraordinary virtues. On that day too, one should perform Pacchakkhana with Ayambil.

Similarly, according to the order mentioned earlier, one should read the third study, 'Namo Ayariyaanam', which has three parts, one speaker, and seven letters, which achieves the meaning mentioned earlier, and perform Ayambil.

One should read the fourth study, 'Namo Uvvajjaayaanam', which has three parts, one speaker, and seven letters, which achieves the meaning mentioned above, and perform Ayambil.

Similarly, one should read the fifth study, 'Namo Loe Savvasahunam', which has four parts, one speaker, and nine letters, and perform Ayambil on the fifth day, that is, the tenth day.

Similarly, one should read the Pancha Namokkar, which has eleven parts, three speakers, and thirty-three letters, like a Chulika, which follows its meaning, 'Savva Pavappanasano. Mangalaanam Cha Savvesim, Padham Havayi Mangalam', taking one part each for three days, and performing Ayambil tapas with the same order and division on the sixth, seventh, and eighth days. Similarly, prepare this five auspicious great Shruta Skandha with its sounds, letters, parts, parts, letters, dots, and measures, which is pure, of great virtue, which has been taught by the guru, which has been read, in such a way that it is well remembered on the front part of the tongue, in the order of the past, the order of the future, and the order of the present.

After that, according to the instructions given, in a place of Chaityalaya-Jinalaya, which is free from creatures, at an auspicious time according to the date, Karan, Muhurta, Nakshatra, Yoga, Lagna, and Chandrabala, one should listen carefully to the clear recitation with great arrangement and pomp, along with the eighth tapas, purpose, and permission, and understand it well. This is the method of performing the five auspicious Vinaya Upadhan. Sutra - 494

O Bhagavan! Are these the principles and meanings of the five auspicious great Shruta Skandha, which is like the wish-fulfilling Kalpavriksha? O Gautam! This is the five auspicious great Shruta Skandha, which is like the unimaginable wish-fulfilling Kalpavriksha, which fulfills all desires.

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Mahānishītha'

Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number Sūtra and Meaning are the prototypes. They are as follows -

Just as oil spreads in the earth, nectar in the lotus, and the five Astikāyas in all the worlds, in the same way, this five-fold auspiciousness is pervasive in the entire Āgama for the Mahāśruta Skandha. The nature of the qualities of all beings has been stated. So, to whom should the ultimate praise be given? To those who were in this world in the past. In this entire world, all those who were or will be excellent in the past or future are worthy of praise. Such excellent and virtuous ones are only the five - Arihant, Siddha, Āchārya, Upādhyāya, and Sādhu. There is no other supreme being besides them. They are of five types - Arihant, Siddha, Āchārya, Upādhyāya, and Sādhu. These five have been described as having the essence-truth qualities of the Supreme Being.

Humans, gods, and Asuras recognize this entire world through the eight Mahāprātihārya, etc., and their worship. They are extraordinary, inconceivable in their influence, possessors of Kevala Jnāna, and have been blessed with the highest excellence. They are called 'Arihant' because they have attained complete destruction of karma, their seed of rebirth has been completely extinguished, and they will not be born again in this world. Or, they have conquered the eight karma enemies by overcoming extreme suffering, destroyed them, broken them into pieces, melted them, ended them, and subdued them. They have destroyed the karma enemies forever. Such ones are called 'Arihant'.

Thus, the Arihant is understood in many ways, explained, and described. They are called, taught, made, and instructed.

And the Siddha Bhagavant, who have attained Siddhahood through great effort, like the restraint of yoga, with their inconceivable power of Mahākalyaṇa, Mahāānanda, Mahotsava, Nirūpama Sukha, and Nishkampa Shakladhyāna, etc. Or, they have attained Siddhahood by consuming the practice of Siddhahood through the destruction of the eight types of karma. Such Siddha Bhagavants are those who have become Siddhas by burning the karma bound by the fire of Shukladhyāna. They are Siddhas, complete, free, and have fulfilled all their purposes. Such are the Siddha Bhagavants! These Siddha Bhagavants are of many types - male, female, neuter, other-gender, householder, every-Buddha, self-Buddha, etc., who have attained Siddhahood by destroying all karma.

And the Āchārya, who always conduct themselves without any lapse in their conduct, with the thirty-six types of knowledge, etc., and the Āchāra, relying on the eighteen thousand Shilaṅgas, and with a body. They are Āchārya because they conduct themselves for the benefit of all truth and the community of disciples. They are Āchārya because they do not initiate the beginning of the existence of the earth-body, etc., beings, even at the time of the abandonment of the body. Or, they are Āchārya because they do not approve of the beginning. Even though they commit a great offense, they do not commit any sin in their mind. Thus, they are called Āchārya. They are described in many ways, such as name-establishment, etc.

And the Upādhyāya, who have well-bound the Asrava doors, use their mind, speech, and body in beautiful yoga, and are well-versed in the twelve limbs of the Shruta Jnāna, reading and teaching the pure twelve limbs with proper pronunciation, consonants, vowels, dots, words, and letters. They contemplate and focus on their own and others' means of liberation. They contemplate, remember, and meditate on the twelve-limbed Shruta Jnāna, including the infinite-going categories, which they have become familiar with. Thus, they are explained in many ways.

The Sādhu Bhagavants are those who have extreme, severe, and intense austerities and conduct, various vows, rules, fasts, and special observances, and who endure the hardships of loneliness, equality, and suffering. They are called Sādhu Bhagavants because they are free from all suffering and practice liberation. This is what we should contemplate in our minds.

What will the salutation to these five, 'Eso Panch Namokkāro', do? It will destroy all sins, including the Jñānavarṇīya, etc., in every direction. It is the destroyer of all sins. This verse is called the first purpose within the mind, 'Eso Panch Namokkāro Savvapāvappaṇāsano'. This purpose is of this nature.

Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

Study/Purpose/Sutra Number Mangalanam Cha Savvesim, Padham Havayi Mangalam. In the word Mangal, the word Mangal means Nirvana Sukh. Such Dharma, which is capable of achieving Moksha Sukh, has the form of Samyag Darshan, etc., and is characterized by Ahimsa, which brings me to it, is Mangal. And it is Mangal that takes me beyond Bhav - Samsara. Or, it is Mangal that destroys, merges, and annihilates my eight types of Karma groups, which are bound, touched, and extracted.

What is the special feature of this Mangal and other Sarva Mangal? The praise of Arihant in the beginning is this Mangal. This is the meaning in brief. Now, know the meaning in detail below. At that time, O Gautam! There are Dharma Tirthankar Arihants, whose words have the meaning explained later, who are more worthy of worship than the supremely worshipful. Because they have the characteristics mentioned here. They are Achintya, Aprameya, Nirupam, incomparable, and are endowed with a group of superior and superior qualities, and are therefore the greatest in the three worlds, and are the producers of mental joy. Just as the group of streams of the first rain gives peace to the peacock group, which is scorched by the heat of the long summer, in the same way, the Arihant Bhagvant, by the rise of the Tirthankar name-karma, which is the form of great merit accumulated over many births, gives the best advice, etc., and destroys the suffering of the Bhavy Jiva, who is bound by the results of such things as Sajjad Raga, Dvesha, Moha, Mithyatva, Avirati, Pramada, and Dushta-Sanklishta, which are caused by the terrible evil karma.

They are omniscient because they know everything. They are endowed with inexhaustible strength, vigor, wealth, sattva, and valor, which are unmatched in the world, due to the group of great merits accumulated over many births. The form of the front part of the big toe of their beautiful, radiant feet is so extraordinary that it makes the series of all planets, stars, and the moon dull in comparison to the group of radiant, powerful rays of the sun, which appears in ten directions. The brilliance of the body of the Tirthankar Bhagvant makes the entire beauty, radiance, brilliance, grace, and form of the gods, including all the Vidyadharas, Devanganas, Devendras, and Asurendras, dull and lifeless.

There are thirty-four such extraordinary, superior, incomparable, and unusual things, four of which are natural, eleven due to the destruction of karma, and nineteen due to the gods. Seeing them, Bhavanpati, Vanavyantar, Jyotishk, Vaimanik, Ahmindra, Indra, Apsara, Kinnar, Nar Vidyadhar, Sur, and Asura, along with the beings of the world, are amazed. Oh! We have never seen anything like this before today. They are all gathered together. Today we have seen a group of unparalleled, great, inconceivable qualities, the ultimate wonder, in one person. At that time, they were filled with great joy, which arose continuously from such auspicious results. They were filled with joy and affection, and they began to speak words of joy to each other, and they went ahead, walking with the Bhagvant, and then they began to criticize their own souls. They said to each other, "Indeed, we are worthy of hatred, we are unworthy, we are without merit. The Bhagvant has gone ahead, walking, and then we have experienced turmoil. They fainted, their hearts filled with turmoil. Their bodies became extremely weak due to their trembling. Their bodies contracted, their hands and feet spread out, they showed joy, their eyes blinked, their bodily functions were bound, they spoke in a slurred, slow voice, unable to understand, and they let out long, warm sighs with a slow, long groan. Only a very intelligent person could judge their mind.

The beings of the world began to think, "How can we obtain such great Siddhi by practicing such austerities?" They were amazed by their Siddhi and prosperity, and by seeing them, they placed their hands on their chests, creating a great wonder, and marveling at their minds. Therefore, O Gautam! The group of qualities of the Arihant Bhagvant, who is the propagator of the Dharma Tirth, whose name is well received, whose body is endowed with an infinite group of qualities, is like a treasure trove of jewels. Even if Indra Maharaj, or any other four knowledgeable or great extraordinary beings, were to describe it with thousands of tongues, day and night, for millions of years, they would still not be able to describe the qualities of the Arihant, who is like the self-born ocean.

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Mahānishītha'

Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number: Because, O Gautama! The Arihant Bhagavants, who are the propagators of Dharma Tīrtha, possess infinite qualities and treasures. Therefore, what should be said about them here? Where the lords of the three realms, the gurus of the world, the one kin of the three universes, the best quality-based Dharma Tīrthankaras of the three realms, the selection of such a Tīrthankara is only a part of the tip of a thumb, adorned with many qualities. The form of its infinite parts is not capable of being described by Indra and others. While specifically mentioning this, it is said:

If the gods and Indra, or any such devotee, were to describe the qualities of their thumb for the destruction of the suffering, poverty, distress, birth, old age, death, disease, affliction, dejection, illness, pain, etc., caused by the mass of evil karma accumulated over many lifetimes, then the group of qualities of the Bhagavan, which shines brightly on the tip of their tongue like a group of sun rays, would be spoken by the gods, including Indra, together, but even then, they would not be able to describe it. Then what would the Kevalajnani, who has the eye of knowledge, say?

Therefore, O Gautama! In this matter, understand this ultimate truth here: Only the Kevalajnani Tīrthankara is capable of describing the ocean of qualities of the Tīrthankara Bhagavants. No one else can be capable of doing so. Because their speech is extraordinary. Therefore, they are capable of speaking. Or, O Gautama! What is the point of saying more about this matter? I will tell you the essential meaning, which is as follows: Sūtra - 495-496

The Jinesvara Bhagavants, whose feet are worshipped by gods and Indra, are free from the stain of the eight types of karma, which are like dirt, and whose mere name is remembered by the mind, speech, and body, which are the three causes, and who are focused on them, and whose soul does not contradict the rules of conduct and restraint, and who are constantly engaged in the vows of conduct and restraint, will surely attain liberation in a short time. Sūtra - 497-499

Whoever is distressed by the suffering of the world of living beings and desires to attain the happiness of liberation, let them become like a bee immersed in a lotus grove, and let them be absorbed in praising, glorifying, and chanting auspicious victory chants for the Bhagavants. Let them, with a heart full of devotion, place their forehead on the ground before the pair of feet of the Jinesvara, with folded hands, and let them, with a firm vow and conduct, free from doubts and other impurities, and with a complete understanding of the meaning of right conduct, embrace the single quality of the Tīrthankara in their heart, then they will surely attain liberation. Sūtra - 500

O Gautama! The manifestation of such Tīrthankara Bhagavants in the world, whose holy name is the source of such excellent fruits, is a great wonder, a vast manifestation in the three universes, and such an extraordinary expansion is of this nature. Sūtra - 501-503

Even those beings who have not attained Kevalajnana, Manahparyavajnana, and the ultimate body, are capable of destroying the eight types of karma by seeing the extraordinary qualities of the Arihant. They are free from great suffering and gestation, they are great yogis, they are distressed by the ocean of existence filled with various sufferings, and they become detached from the world in an instant. Or, O Gautama! Putting aside another statement, but in this way, the Dharma Tīrthankara is such a noble name. It adorns the Arihant, Bhagavant, Jinesvara, Dharma Tīrthankara, who is the kin of the three universes. It is not fitting to give this name to others. Because they have, without hiding the power of their heroic deeds, which have been manifested in many births, marked by the characteristics of the cessation of delusion, emotion, detachment, compassion, and faith, and which have been touched by right faith and joy, constantly practiced severe, difficult, and painful austerities, and have acquired a group of great merits of the highest kind. They have become the best, the most excellent, the pure, the kin of the entire universe, the name and the supreme master.

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

**Study/Purpose/Sutra Number**

From the beginning of time, the unique Tirthankara, who has bound the sinful karma by the power of the sinful thoughts of the cycle of birth and death, has been cutting it. He is adorned with a thousand and eight auspicious marks, which are extremely beautiful, radiant, illuminating the ten directions, and unparalleled. He is the abode of the highest beauty in the world, and his appearance fills the hearts of gods and humans with wonder, and their eyes and minds with great amazement and joy. The Tirthankara Bhagvant is free from the stain of all sinful karma. He possesses the most sacred and supreme body, adorned with the perfect square institution and the best Vajrishbhanaraach Sanghayan.

Such Tirthankara Bhagvant, who is the most glorious, powerful, influential, and supreme, is the one who establishes the Dharma Tirth. And then it is said in Sutra-504-508:

If all the humans, gods, Indra, and goddesses are gathered together, and their form, radiance, and beauty are compared to the tip of the toe of the Jinendra's foot, even a crore or lakh part of it, then the form of those gods and goddesses will appear dull like a piece of gold placed near the Meru mountain. Or if all the virtues of all the men in this world are gathered together, they will not even reach a fraction of the virtues of that Tirthankara. If the entire three worlds are gathered together on one side, and the Tirthankara Bhagvant is alone on the other side, even then he is superior in virtues. Therefore, he is the most worthy of worship, praiseworthy, and venerable. He is wise and intelligent, therefore, bow down to that Tirthankara with devotion. Sutra-509-512

In the world, the people of a village, town, city, province, country, or even the whole of India, obey the commands of their respective rulers. But if the village headman is very happy, how much will he give from a village? Give whatever you have. Even a small donation from a Chakravarti will destroy the poverty of his entire lineage (all the relatives). And then he desires the position of a minister, the minister desires the position of a Chakravarti, and the Chakravarti desires the position of a king. The Devendra desires the position of a Tirthankara, who gives the desired happiness to the world. Sutra-513-514

The Tirthankara Bhagvant, whose position even Indra desires with great devotion and single-minded focus, is the best. There is no doubt about it. Therefore, all the gods, demons, planets, stars, sun, moon, etc., also worship the Tirthankara. And indeed, he is the destroyer of sins. Sutra-515-516

Two types of worship are described for the Dharma Tirthankara, who is worthy of worship in the three worlds and the guru of the world: material worship and devotional worship. Performing virtuous acts and practicing severe austerities is devotional worship, and the Deshvirati Shravak who performs worship, respects, and gives charity, etc., is material worship. O Gautam! Understand the meaning here in this way. Sutra-517

Devotional worship is like the practice of excellent character, while material worship is like the worship of the Jina. Devotional worship is for the Muni, and both types of worship are described for the Shravak. Among them, devotional worship is commendable. Sutra-518

O Gautam! Here, some people who do not understand the true meaning of the scriptures, are depressed, weak, and lazy, and are always attached to the worldly life. They are the Muni Diparatnasagar Krit (Mahanishith) Agam Sutra-Hindi Translation

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Mahānishīth'

Those who do not think about the loss of study/purpose/sūtra number, who behave according to their own mind, who are free-willed, attached to ṛiddhi, rasa, śātā-gārava, etc., who are deeply attached to raga, filled with raga-dvesha, moha-andhakāra-mamatva, etc., who are turned away from all restraint and true dharma, who are merciless, shameless, devoid of hatred for sin, devoid of compassion, merciless, who have a mind that is attached to the act of sin, who are extremely cruel, fierce, and cruel in solitude, who are of false vision, who are devoid of all association, beginning, and attachment, who take samayika grahana from dravya (through mind, speech, and body, by doing, causing, and allowing) but not from bhava, who only have their heads shaved in name, who have only left the aṇagāra-ghar in name, who are only a mahāvratadhari in name, who, despite being a śramaṇa, follow and promote the wrong path by holding contrary beliefs, they are like this:

We always perform tīrtha prabhavana by worshipping the fragrance, garland, lamp, samārjana, liṁpana, cloth, bali, dhūpa, etc., of Arihant Bhagvant. Those who believe in them promote the wrong path. Thus, their duty is not in accordance with true dharma. O Gautama! One should not even approve of their duty through words.

O Bhagvant! Why is it said that one should not approve of their dravya pūjana even through words? O Gautama! According to their words, there is an abundance of asanyama and the destruction of the root qualities, which leads to the inflow of karma, and then, with adhyavasaya, there is a binding of gross and subtle auspicious and inauspicious karma-natures, the mahāvrat, which is like the renunciation of all precautions, is broken, the breaking of the vrata leads to the fault of disobeying the command, which leads to following the wrong path, which leads to the loss of the right path, promoting the wrong path and destroying the right path is like a great misfortune for a yati. Because those who commit such a great misfortune have to take birth and death in the four gatis for an infinite time. Therefore, one should not approve of such words. Sūtra-519-520

Dravyastava and bhavastava, both are good, but bhavastava is much better. Those who say that dravyastava is very good, their mind is not wise. O Gautama! One should behave in such a way that the welfare of the six-sense beings is protected. This dravyastava, worshipping the Lord with fragrance, flowers, etc., is considered appropriate for a śrāvaka who is a desha-virati but has not renounced all sins. But for a restrained sadhu who has renounced all sins, performing dravyastava is not appropriate, it is like worshipping with flowers, etc. Sūtra-521-522

O Gautama! Perhaps you think that since the thirty-two Indras have performed both dravyastava and bhavastava, it is appropriate to do so. But understand it this way. This is considered to be bhavastava, which is like a desire to obtain their favour. For an avirati Indra, bhavastava (compassion for the six-sense beings in the form of trividha trividha) is impossible. King Daśārṇabhadra honoured Bhagvant with pomp and show, he performed dravya pūjana and lost in comparison to Indra, then he accepted the diksha, which is like bhavastava. Then he also defeated Indra. This is an example to be applied here, therefore bhavastava is the best. Sūtra-523-526

The Chakravarti, Surya, Chandra, Datta, Damaka, etc., asked Bhagvant, "Did they perform pūjana-satkāra with devotion, which no one could do with all kinds of ṛiddhi? Did they understand it as sarva-savadha? Or did they understand it as trividha virati? Or did they consider it as pūjana for those who are virati with all kinds of yoga?" O Bhagvant, Indra has performed all kinds of pūjana with all his power. O Gautama! Even if an avirati Indra has performed pūjana-satkāra with the best kind of devotion, one should combine the dravya and bhavastava of both the desha-virati and the avirati according to their ability.

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Mahānishītha'
Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number Sūtra-527
O Gautama! All Tīrthankara devotees have practiced the same conduct as those who have eradicated all eight karmas. Sūtra-528-530
Those who are afraid of existence, wherever they go, wherever there is a possibility of harming living beings, such as touching them, and wherever there is a possibility of causing harm to themselves or others, their minds do not engage in such activities. Therefore, those who are restrained from harming themselves or others should practice such rituals that are beneficial in all ways. The only ritual that is the essence of the path to liberation, that is solitary, that gives happiness, and that reveals the ultimate truth is the conduct of complete renunciation. It is as follows: Sūtra-531-537
Imagine a Meru mountain, as high as a lakh yojanas, adorned with a sea of jewels, made of gold, extremely beautiful, pleasing to the eyes and mind, extremely knowledgeable, extremely strong, and invisible, joined together in such a way that it appears as if it were one, extremely smooth, with parts well-divided, with many peaks, with many bells and flags, with excellent toranas, where the beauty of the mountain or palace is visible as one walks step by step. Similarly, imagine incense made of camphor, sandalwood, etc., which emits a fragrance when placed in fire, well-decorated with many kinds of wonderful and beautiful flowers, filled with many kinds of dances, with sweet sounds of mridanga, filled with hundreds of people of good intentions, with people whose minds are filled with the desire to hear the character and teachings of Jineshvara Bhagavan, where stories are told, where there are commentators, dancers, apsaras, gandharvas, and the sounds of musical instruments are heard. This is the kind of world that is filled with the qualities mentioned above, where there are thousands of pillars made of gold, jewels, and gems, all earned through righteous means, and where the floor is made of gold. The temple of the Jina that is built with such qualities is said to be filled with many qualities of austerity and restraint. Sūtra-538-540
In this way, through austerity and restraint, one cleanses the dirt of the karmas accumulated over many existences, and attains liberation, which is full of infinite happiness, in a short time. Even if a devotee who practices the four kinds of beautiful Dharma, such as dana, etc., which adorn the entire earth with the Jina's teachings, attains the highest speed, he cannot go beyond the twelfth devlok. He can only go up to the twelfth devlok, which is called Achyuta. Sūtra-541-542
O Gautama! Even the gods who reside in the seventh devlok, called Sarvarthasiddha, fall from there. If we think about the rest, there is no permanent or stable place in the world. How can the present happiness be called happiness when it is followed by suffering after a long time? How can the happiness that is temporary and ends in death be considered great? Even if all the humans and gods are gathered together for a long time, they cannot experience or hear as much happiness as even a small part of the infinite happiness of liberation.
Sūtra-543-545
O Gautama! Within the happiness of this great world, there are thousands of terrible and fierce sufferings hidden. But those who are dull-witted cannot recognize them when the karmas that cause suffering arise. Even in a mountain of jewels and gold, there is iron hidden inside.

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, ‘Mahanishith’

**Study/Purpose/Sutra Number** Like a rock or like a merchant's daughter (this is worthy of an occasion. There, such meaning can be derived that just as the face of a well-born, modest, and veiled merchant's daughter cannot be seen by others, so also the bliss of liberation is not described.)

**Like a guest in a city** who comes and stays, a Bhil cannot describe the city's pleasures like the royal palace, etc. Similarly, here, even the most knowledgeable person cannot describe the bliss of liberation in the realms of gods, demons, and humans. Sutra-546

**How can you call it punya** (merit) when its end is not visible even after a long time? And then, how can you call it punya or happiness when its end is with suffering and it increases the cycle of the world? Sutra-547

**The one who thinks about the splendor of the divine chariot** and then the falling away from the heavenly realm, his heart is truly made of the strength of a Vikriya body. Otherwise, it would break into a hundred pieces. Sutra-548-549

**The suffering within the hellish realm** is so unbearable that even if someone who lives for millions of years starts to describe it, they would not be able to complete it. Therefore, O Gautam! Only through the practice of the ten types of Yati Dharma, severe austerities, and restraint, can one attain the imperishable, liberation, and bliss. Sutra-550

**In the realm of the hellish beings, in the realm of the animals, in the realm of the gods, or in the form of Indra,** one cannot attain what one can attain in the human realm. Sutra-551

**Only when the great, very numerous, and very powerful karmas called Charitravaraniya are destroyed,** O Gautam! can a being become capable of attaining the state of liberation. Sutra-552

**One cannot attain the highest Dharma of character without acquiring a human birth** and the great accumulation of punya earned in past lives. Sutra-553

**Those who have practiced well, are free from malice and pride, and whose character is incomparable,** they attain the infinite, imperishable bliss of liberation, which remains in the forefront of the three realms. Sutra-554-556

**Having acquired a human birth with the qualities of wisdom, etc., which burns away the eight types of sinful actions, like a high mountain, accumulated over many lifetimes,** whoever does not practice self-interest and the restraint of inflow according to the scriptures, and then does not diligently uphold the eighteen thousand vows, they continuously burn in the fierce fire of suffering for a long time, with great anxiety, and burn endlessly. Sutra-557-560

**The womb, filled with foul-smelling excrement, pus, bile, vomit, phlegm, mucus, etc., and with fat, flesh, thick impurities, feces, urine, and blood, is a place of constant churning, movement, and decay, where all the limbs are gathered and contracted.** In this womb, one takes birth in many wombs.

The study/purpose/sūtra number remained. The controlled limbs, each one, repeatedly wandered in the womb, now the one who was terrified by the suffering of the world and the strangeness of the world, such as birth, death, and womb, should make a strong effort and inclination for that, knowing the effect of Bhāva-stava, which destroys all this fear. Sūtra - 561

In the same way, the world of Vidyādhara, Kinnara, Manava, Deva, and Asura praised the Jinesvara, who is the best in the three worlds, in two ways: Dravya-stava and Bhāva-stava. Sūtra - 562-569

O Gautama! The Dharma Tīrthankara Bhagavan, Arihant, Jinesvara, who have attained vast ṛiddhi. Such prosperity is independent, yet the world-friend is not even tempted by it for a moment. Their supreme glory, beauty, grace, color, strength, body size, power, fame, and renown, as they descended from the Deva-loka here, as they attained the Deva-loka in another bhava by intense tapas, as they bound the Tīrthankara name-karma by worshipping one Ādi-visthānak, as they attained Samyaktva, as they worshipped Śramaṇapan in the remaining bhava, as the queen Triśalā, the wife of the king Siddārtha, received fourteen great dreams, as the inauspicious and impure things were removed from the womb and fragrant and sweet smells were established, as Indra Raja, with great devotion, placed the nectar food in the joint of the thumb, as the Bhagavan was praised by Indra and others until birth, and then as the Dik-kumārī came and performed the birth-related rituals, as the thirty-two Deva-endras, with glorious devotion, fulfilled all their duties with great joy and all ṛiddhi, as they performed the coronation of the Lord on the peak of Mount Meru, then the bodies of the devotees, filled with excitement, became thrilled with the touch of the garment, and they thought, "Indeed, our birth has been fulfilled." Sūtra - 570-579

For a moment, they moved their hands, sang in a beautiful voice, made the sound of a deep drum, uttered auspicious words from their mouths like the sounds that emerged from the ocean of milk, and they joined their hands in anjali, as they performed the coronation festival with a tall kalasa made of gold and jewels, perfumed with the fragrance of many fragrant things from the water of the ocean of milk, as the Jinesvara moved the mountain, as the Bhagavan, even though he was eight years old, created the "Indra Grammar," as he spent his childhood, as he had to get married, as the Lokāntika Deva gave him enlightenment, as all the Devas and Asuras rejoiced and celebrated the Bhagavan's initiation, as he endured the severe hardships of the divine human and animal realms, as he burned the four ghanaghati karmas with intense tapas, meditation, and yoga, as he attained the Kevala-jnana that illuminated the Lokāloka, as the Devas and Asuras praised the glory of Kevala-jnana and asked questions about Dharma, Nīti, Tapas, and Charitra, as he sat on the throne prepared by the Devas and prepared the best Samvasarana, as the Devas compared his ṛiddhi with the ṛiddhi of the world, as the Arihant Bhagavan, the great teacher of the entire universe, wandered wherever he wanted, as the eight great miracles are present in the beautiful signs of the Tīrtha, as he destroys the entire karma of the smooth Mithyātva of the ancient bhava of the glorious jīva, as he gives enlightenment and establishes them in the path, as he initiates the Ganadhara, and then he weaves the great sūtras, as the Jinenadra tells the Ganadhara the meaning of the Anantagama Paryāya. Sūtra - 580-585

Study/Purpose/Sutra Number Then, those gods, finding sorrow in the absence of the Bhagvant, were washing their bodies with the flow of tears, the sound of which was like the rustling of water. And then they lamented in sorrowful voices, "O Master! You have made us orphans." Just as the gods, with the wood of the fragrant sandalwood tree, performed the funeral rites of the Bhagvant. After performing the rites, those who were grieving looked towards the empty ten directions. Just as the bones of the Jineswar were washed in the Kshir-Sagar, taken to the Devalok, anointed with the best sandalwood paste, worshipped with the flowers of the Ashoka tree, the Parijat tree, and the lotus of the Shatapatra Sahasrapatra variety, and then praised in their respective abodes. (That entire account is known in great detail from the Arhant Charitra) Know it from the Antagad Dasha. Sutra-586-589
Here, if it is said, leaving aside the current authority, then there will be a digression, irrelevance, and a long expansion of the text. Despite the lack of a proposal, we have explained so much, there is a very big reason for the teaching, which is explained here. It is said for the benefit of those noble beings. Just as a modak mixed with good ghee is eaten, so too, great mental joy arises in people. In the same way, even though there is no opportunity here, the Bhavatma, whose mind is drawn to the absorption of the Nirguna, burdened by devotion, experiences great joy. Sutra-590
This Panchamangal Mahashrutaskandha Navakar was explained in great detail by the Tirthankar, who possessed infinite knowledge and vision, different from the Sutras, such as the Niyukti, Bhashya, and Churni. In the same way, it was explained briefly. But due to the defect of the passage of time, those Niyukti, Bhashya, and Churni were broken, and that time-period passed away. Then, twelve-limbed Shruta-bearing, born, named Vraj Swami, who possessed great wealth, gain, and prosperity, appeared. He rescued this Panchamangal Mahashrutaskandha, writing it in the middle of the original Sutra. Gandhar-Bhagvant explained the original Sutra from the Sutra perspective, and Dharma Tirthankar Arhant Bhagvant explained it from the meaning. The Veer Jinendra, worshipped by the three worlds, shaped it in this way. This is the tradition of the old Acharyas. Sutra-591
Here, wherever there are words connected with each other, and where the continuous Sutra-alapk is not available, the Shruthadharas, the Lahiyas, have written falsely. Do not blame such a fault, but the original copy of this Mahānishīth Shrutaskandha, which is like an unfathomable Chintamani and Kalpavriksha, was eaten by Udhayi, etc., and due to that, it became a fragmented copy. Many leaves have rotted, yet this Mahānishīth Shrutaskandha is full of great meaning. Knowing that it is the ultimate essence, the best, the most meaningful, and the most profound of the entire discourse, and believing that many noble beings will benefit from the affection of the discourse, and for the benefit of his own soul, Acharya Haribhadrasuri wrote what was in that ideal, purifying it with his own mind. Other Acharyas, such as Siddhen Diwakar, Vridhvadi, Yakshasen, Devgupta, Yashovardhan, Kshamasraman's disciple Ravigupta, Nemichandra, Jindasagani, Kshamak, Satyarsi, etc., the main Shruthadharas of the age, have honored it. Sutra-592
O Gautam! According to what is said further, after reading the Panchamangal Mahashrutaskandha (Navakar) with Vinaya-Upadhan, in the order of the past, the order of the future, and the order of the present, with the correct pronunciation of the vowels, consonants, matras, bindu, and letters, and after making it stable and familiar in the heart, and knowing the Sutra and its meaning in great detail, what should be read?
O Gautam! After that, the Iriya Vahiy Sutra should be read.

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Mahānishītha'

**Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number:** O Bhagvant! Why is it said that after reading the Panchamangal Mahā Śruta Skandha, one should read the Iriyāvahiya Sūtra?

**O Gautama!** When our soul, due to the results of actions like coming and going, becomes entangled in many beings, prānas, bhūtas, and sattvas, due to misuse or negligence, and then there is a clash, disturbance, or injury, and then its criticism is done through pratikramna, and for the destruction of all karma, some ritual like caitya vandan, svādhyāya, dhyāna, etc. is performed, at that time, whether there is a concentrated mind or not, because due to the involvement of the mind in the results of many other activities like coming and going, some beings do not leave the previous results and remain in the state of dullness for some time. Then there is a conflict in its results. And when, due to some fault like ignorance, attachment, delusion, etc., there is a sudden clash or suffering of a one-sense being, and after that, "Oh! This bad deed has been done by us. How have we become blind in the attachment, hatred, delusion, false belief, and ignorance? We do not even think about the bitter fruits of this deed in the afterlife. Indeed, we are cruel and heartless." In this way, the souls who regret and feel intense remorse, by criticizing the fault, doing bad deeds, bowing down to the guru, and taking prāyaścitta, become free from the burden. When the ritual becomes useful for self-benefit, then the mind attains a state of complete concentration for the destruction of evil karma. From that, the desired fruit is obtained for all beings, prānis, bhūtas, and sattvas in the world.

Therefore, O Gautama! No ritual should be performed without reading the Iriyāvahiya Padikkama. If one desires the true fruit, then, O Gautama! It is said that after making the Panchamangal Mahā Śruta Skandha, the Navakāra Sūtra, its meaning, and both of them stable and familiar, one should read the Iriyāvahiya Sūtra. **Sūtra-593**

**O Bhagvant!** How should the Iriyāvahiya Sūtra be read? **O Gautama!** It should be read according to the method of the Panchamangal Mahā Śruta Skandha. **Sūtra-594**

**O Bhagvant!** What should be done after reading the Iriyāvahiya Sūtra? **O Gautama!** One should read the Śakrastava, etc., caitya vandan. But the Śakrastava should be read once, and then thirty-two āyambils should be performed after it. For the Arhant sattva, i.e., the Arihant Cheiāṇam, one upavāsa and five āyambils should be performed. For the twenty-four stava-logass, one chhaḷū, one upavāsa, and twenty-five āyambils should be performed. The Śrutastava-Pukkhara Varadīvadḍhe Sūtra should be read properly with one upavāsa and five āyambils.

In that way, the study of the sūtra should be done with pure pronunciation, consonants, vowels, dots, word divisions, words, and letters, so that the letters of one word do not merge into another. The study of the sūtra should be done with other qualities mentioned in the same way. The study of the entire sūtra and its meaning should be done with the mentioned penance and method. Wherever there is any doubt, that sūtra should be thought about again. After thinking, it should be understood without any doubt. **Sūtra-595**

In this way, after reading the sūtra, its meaning, and both of them, along with the caitya vandan, etc., rituals, if there is a combination of auspicious date, karana, muhūrta, nakshatra yoga, lagna, and moon strength, then, according to one's ability, one should gather the equipment for worshipping the Jagadguru Tirthankara Bhagvant, and with a devotional heart, full of devotion, and thrilled with excitement, one should offer it to the Sadhu Bhagvant.

**Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'**

A person with a body, with a smiling face, filled with faith, devotion, wisdom, and supreme detachment, who has eradicated the deep-rooted impurities of attachment, hatred, delusion, and false belief, who experiences such pure, extremely pure, spotless, auspicious, and especially auspicious joy, I am truly blessed and virtuous for having established a statue of the Bhuvanaguru Jinendra, with my sight and mind, with a focused mind. I have made my birth successful by worshipping Jinendra.

With this belief, one should join both hands above the forehead, creating an Anjali, and with both knees on the ground, for the sake of the earth devoid of living plants, seeds, animals, etc., with a pure heart, in a beautiful manner, one should respectfully offer salutations to the Chaitya, having understood the true meaning of the Sutras and their implications without any doubt, with a firm character, a scholar of the scriptures, with many virtues like unwavering devotion, etc., along with the Guru, Sadhus, Sadhvis, and fellow Dharma practitioners. After that, one should, as much as possible, offer salutations to the fellow Dharma practitioners, and then, with a soft, clean, and precious garment, one should honor them with great respect. At this time, one should give a Dharma discourse to the Guru Maharaj, who has understood the essence of the scriptures, elaborating on the principles of Dharma, generating dispassion for the world, increasing faith and devotion. Sutra-596-597

After that, with utmost faith, devotion, and eagerness, one should make some commitments for life. For example, "O beloved of the gods! You have truly obtained a beautiful human birth and made it successful. From today onwards, for the rest of your life, you should always contemplate the Chaitya with a peaceful and focused mind, without haste, in all three times. This is the essence of humanity, which is impure, impermanent, and fleeting. Do not put water in your mouth until you have worshipped the Chaitya and the Sadhu every morning. Do not eat your midday meal until you have visited the Chaitya. Do not violate the evening ritual without contemplating the Chaitya. Make these commitments for life." Then, O Gautam! We will tell you further, after empowering the Guru with the (Vardhaman) Vidya, one should place seven handfuls of fragrant powder on his head and say these blessings: "May you become one who crosses the ocean of this world."

Vardhaman Vidya- Om Namo Bhagavao Arahao Sijjhau Me Bhagavati Mahavijjā Vire Mahavirē Jayavīrē Seṇavīrē Vaddhamān Vīrē Jayantē Aparājīē Swāhā.

One should fast and perform the Sadhana according to the rituals. With this Vidya, you will become one who crosses every Dharma worship. In the Great Initiation, with the permission of the Ganipada, one should chant this Vidya seven times and say, "May you cross the Nitharaga." When one accepts the final Sadhana, the Anasan, one should empower them with this Vidya and perform the Vasakshepa, then they become a soul worshipper. The influence of this Vidya pacifies the group of obstacles and brings about auspiciousness. When a valiant man enters battle, he will not be defeated by anyone. At the end of the Kalpa, he will bring about auspiciousness and prosperity. Sutra-598

Then, one should say to the Sadhus, Sadhvis, Shravakas, Shravikas, and all the nearby fellow Dharma practitioners, "You are truly blessed and virtuous," and while saying this, one should perform the Vasakshepa mantra and accept it.

After that, one should accept a fragrant, unbleached white garland, in the place of the Jagadguru Jinendra, and the Guru Maharaj should place it on both pillars with his own hands, saying, "O great soul! You have made your human birth, which you have obtained and earned well, successful, with the group of great merits earned in past lives. O beloved of the gods! The doors to hell and the animal realm are closed for you. You will not be bound by disgrace, ill-repute, or the karma of a low lineage. When you go to the next life, the five prostrations will not be rare for you."

**Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number**

In future births, due to the influence of the five prostrations, wherever you are born, you will obtain the highest caste, the highest family, the highest man, health, and wealth. These things you will surely get.

And then, due to the influence of the five prostrations, you will not get slavery, poverty, misfortune, birth in a low family, or disability. What more to say? O Gautama! Whoever, by this method, performs the five prostrations and other daily rituals, and is devoted to the eighteen thousand śīlāṅga, even if he does not attain liberation by the practice of restraint, he will still enjoy long-lasting happiness in the excellent heavenly realms like Graiveyak, Anuttar, etc., and then be born in a noble family in this human world, obtaining a beautiful, attractive, and perfect body, becoming proficient in all arts, and bringing joy to people's hearts. He will attain great power like the king of the gods, be eager to show compassion and mercy, be free from the suffering of sensual pleasures, practice true Dharma, abandon the karmic residue, and attain liberation. Sūtra-599

**O Bhagavant! Should the five auspicious upadhāna be received with the same discipline and tapas as the study of the entire Śruta-jñāna, like Samāyika, etc.?**

**O Gautama! Yes, the study should be done with the same discipline and tapas as the upadhāna. Especially when teaching the Śruta-jñāna, one should strive to protect the eight types of ācāra, like kāla, etc. Otherwise, there will be a great loss of the Śruta-jñāna. Another thing to keep in mind is that for the study of the twelve angas of the Śruta-jñāna, one should always strive to read and teach in the first and last prahara. And for reading the five auspicious Navakāra, eight pahora have been mentioned. Secondly, remember that the five auspicious Navakāra can be read in Samāyika or even outside of Samāyika. But the Samāyika, etc., and the Sūtra, Ārambha, and Parigraha are only read after abandoning them and performing the Jāvājīva Samāyika. They cannot be read without abandoning the Ārambha-Parigraha or without performing the Jāvājīva Samāyika and taking all the vows. And besides the five auspicious, there are the Ālāpake-Ālāpake, then the Śakrastavādi, and the twelve angas, all of which are the same Śruta-jñāna. The purpose of study (Samuddeśa-Anuññā Vidhi Vakt) is to make it a habit. Sūtra-600**

**O Bhagavant! You have mentioned very strict rules and regulations for the study of the five auspicious Śruta-skandha. How can children follow such strict rules?**

**O Gautama! Whoever does not desire these mentioned rules, studies the five auspicious Śruta-jñāna, etc., without discipline and upadhāna, or studies without upadhāna, or considers it good to teach without upadhāna, or gives Navakāra to such a person, or teaches them Samāyika, etc., is not considered a lover of Dharma or a firm follower of Dharma. He is not considered a devotee of the Śruta. He is one who destroys the Sūtra, its meaning, the Sūtra and its meaning together, and the Guru. Whoever disrespects the Sūtra, its meaning, both, and the Guru, becomes a destroyer of the past, future, and present Tirthankaras. He who destroys the Śruta-jñāna, the Arihant, the Siddha, and the Sadhu, remains trapped in the endless ocean of Samsara for a long time. He is born again and again in the 84 lakh types of yoni, both hidden and revealed, cold and hot, mixed, and many others. And then he has to endure immense pain in the terrible womb, which is filled with foul-smelling excrement, pus, urine, bile, phlegm, impurities, fat, and flesh, vomit, feces, and blood, and is slimy and muddy, and looks ugly and repulsive. He has to endure the pain of being squeezed, pressed, moving with a rattling sound, shaking, trembling, and being tied up tightly like a bundle, all while being confined in the womb for a long time.**

**Those who study this Sūtra, etc., according to the method described in the scriptures, do not deviate even slightly. As said, ...**

**Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'**

Those who, by the study/purpose/sutra-number provision, adorn themselves with the Shruta-knowledge of Panchamangal etc., do not neglect that Sutra, O Gautam! They do not neglect the meaning, they do not aspire for the meaning, they do not aspire for the Sutra-meaning, both, they do not aspire for the Tirthankara who happens in the three times, they do not aspire for the Siddha who has removed the dirt like karma-dust residing on the top of the three lokas. Those who do not aspire for such Siddha, do not aspire for Acharya, Upadhyaya and Sadhu. They are extremely dear to Dharma, firm in Dharma and devoted in solitude. Those who are extremely delighted in the meaning of the Sutra, with a mind full of devotion, are the ones who obtain faith and emotion. Such a virtuous soul does not suffer the pain of repeated births, etc., in this prison-like existence. Sutra-601

But O Gautam! A child who has not yet known the meaning of sin and virtue is inappropriate for that 'Pancha Mangal' in solitude. Do not give him even a single verse of the Panchamangal Mahashruta-Skandha. Because, if the child, having obtained this verse, does not worship properly the karma-mass accumulated in the countless past lives, then it will be a loss for him. That child should first be devoted to Dharma-katha. After that, when you know that he has become dear to Dharma, firm in Dharma and devoted, then make him perform as many Pacchakkhanas as he is capable of performing. Make him perform as many Pacchakkhanas as he is capable of performing, according to his ability, in the form of Ratri-bhojan-vidhi, Trividh, Chauveeh. Sutra-602

O Gautam! By performing 45 Navkarashi, 24 Porisi, 12 Purimudoo, 10 Avadu and four Ekasana (one fast can be counted in this. Two Ayambil and one pure, clean, faultless Ayambil are also counted as one fast.) O Gautam! If one is single-minded in performing Roudradhyan-Artadhyan, Vikatha-free Swadhyaya, without any business, then even if he performs only one Ayambil, he surpasses the Masakshaman. Therefore, make him eligible to read Panchamangal by increasing the number of Tapas-Upadhan in the same proportion as the number of Visama he performs, then make him read Panchamangal, otherwise do not make him read it. Sutra-603

O Bhagvant! If this is done, and if a long time passes and he dies in the middle, how can he perform the final worship without Navkar? O Gautam! When someone starts Tapasya with a sincere intention for the sake of Sutra-Upachaar, understand that he has started studying the Sutra, its meaning and both at the same time. Because that devotee soul does not receive the Sutra, meaning and both of the Pancha Namaskar with improper conduct. But he receives it by performing Tapasya in such a way that he is a devotee with a good intention that it will not be destroyed even in the future lives. Sutra-604

O Gautam! If someone has learned from someone else and has prepared himself by reading the Panchamangal Sutra after receiving the Sutra given by ear from the Shruta-Jnanavaraneya's Kshayopa-sham, should he also perform Tapasya?
O Gautam! Yes, he should also be made to perform Tapasya.
O Bhagvant! Why should he perform Tapasya? O Gautam! For the benefit of easy enlightenment. Consider those who do not perform this Tapasya-vidhan as ignorant. Sutra-605

O Bhagvant! If someone has the rise of a very great Jnanavaraneya karma, and even after chanting day and night, only half a verse is stable and familiar after one year, what should he do? Such a soul should be given Abhigraha for the whole life.

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Mahānishīth'

The one who studies, aims, and grasps the Sūtra numbers or does svādhyāya, should recite with a focused mind, remembering the two and a half thousand proofs of the Panchamangal Sūtras, their meaning, and both together, every day. O Bhagvant! Why (do you say so)? O Gautam! The monk who does not do svādhyāya equally, such as reading, etc., to the best of his ability, in all four times, being free from attachment to worldly possessions, is considered to be ignorant. Sūtra - 606

Secondly, the one who understands the knowledge of the past, with attachment to worldly possessions, until the end of life, reflects on the knowledge acquired earlier in his inability, and recites the two and a half thousand Panchamangal Navakāra in his inability, is also a worshiper of the soul. They attain liberation by consuming their knowledge-obscuring karma, becoming a Tirthankara or a Ganadhara, and attaining the status of a worshiper. Sūtra - 607-610

O Bhagvant! Why is it said that one should do svādhyāya in all four times? O Gautam! The soul, which is hidden by mind, speech, and body, consumes knowledge-obscuring karma every moment. The one who remains in svādhyāya and meditation becomes capable of attaining detachment every moment. For the one who does svādhyāya, the upper world, the lower world, the world of light, the world of flying vehicles, liberation, all worlds, and the world without light are directly visible. There is no other austerity equal to svādhyāya for the soul with right vision, and there will never be, for the twelve types of austerities, both internal and external. Sūtra - 611-615

One, two, three months, or even a year, one may fast without eating, but if one is devoid of svādhyāya and meditation, one does not get even the fruit of one fast. The one who always consumes pure food, produced from the earth, and uses the three yogas of mind, speech, and body with focus, and does svādhyāya every moment, cannot be compared to the one who fasts for a year, even with a focused mind. Because the one who does svādhyāya with focus has infinite nirjarā. The muni who is tolerant, controls the senses, expects nirjarā, and has five samitis and three guptis, does svādhyāya with a focused and steady mind. O Gautam! The one who explains such well-established knowledge of the scriptures, and the one who listens to it with a good intention, both immediately bind the doors of āśrava. Sūtra - 616-619

The one who awakens such a suffering being and establishes him on the path of liberation, is like a drummer who plays a loud drum in this world, including gods and demons. Just as gold, which is predominantly mixed with other metals, does not attain the state of gold without the action of gold, similarly, all beings do not attain awakening without the teachings of the Jinas. The one who knows the scriptures, free from attachment and aversion, and delusion, narrates the Dharmakatha. If the speaker explains the Sūtras and their meaning to the listener in a true way, then the speaker has nirjarā in solitude, and the listener may or may not have nirjarā. Sūtra - 620

O Gautam! Therefore, it is said that one should do svādhyāya in all four times, with attachment to worldly possessions. And again, O Gautam! The monk who reads well-established knowledge properly and then becomes proud of his knowledge is called ignorant. In this way, ignorance is described in many ways. Sūtra - 621-622

O Bhagvant! How many types of ignorance of vision are there? O Gautam! There are two types of ignorance of vision - one from the Āgama and the other from outside the Āgama.

In this, one doubts right vision from the Āgama, desires other doctrines, and has a desire for the dirty clothes of the sadhus and sadhvis.

One who keeps their gaze fixed on the image of a Tirthankara Bhagvant like Rishabha, etc., is called Prashasta-chakshu-kushīla. Prashasta-aprashasta-chakshu-kushīla is one who, while looking at the image of the Tirthankara Bhagvant with their heart and eyes, looks at something else. And then, Prashasta-aprashasta-chakshu-kushīla is one who looks at something like a crow, a bug, a blanket, a butterfly, a peacock, etc., or a beautiful woman with charming beauty.

**Aprashasta-chakshu-kushīla**

O Bhagvant! What are the sixty-six Aprashasta-chakshu-bheda? O Gautam! They are: 1. Sabhrakataksha, 2. Tara, 3. Manda, 4. Madalsa, 5. Vankā, 6. Vivankā, 7. Kushīla, 8. Ardha-ikshita, 9.

(Sūtra 623-624)

**Ghrana-kushīla**

One who goes to smell a good fragrance and wrinkles their nose and feels disgusted when they smell a bad odor is called Ghrana-kushīla.

**Shravana-kushīla**

There are two types of Shravana-kushīla: Prashasta and Aprashasta. One who listens to Gandharva-nataka, Dhanurveda, Hast-shiksha, Kamashastra, Ratishashtra, etc., which arouse lust, excitement, and passion, and does not criticize them or perform their atonement, is considered Aprashasta-shravana-kushīla.

**Jihva-kushīla**

There are many types of Jihva-kushīla. They are: bitter, pungent, tasteless, sweet, sour, and salty tastes.

**Studying/Purpose/Sūtra Number Tasting.** Not seeing, not hearing, light, afterlife, both worlds, those with opposite faults, uttering such abusive words like 'Makar-Jakar Mammo Chachcho'. Accusing falsely, causing disgrace, putting a stain on someone, having the tendency to preach Dharma without knowing the scriptures. Consider that to be tongue-skill. O Bhagvant! Does skillfulness arise from speaking? O Gautam! Yes, it does. O Bhagvant! Then should one not preach Dharma? O Gautam! One who does not know the difference between careful-blameless speech and other speech, does not have the right to speak, then where is the space for preaching Dharma? Sūtra-625

And know that there are two types of body skillfulness, skillful effort and skillful adornment. Among them, the monk who is like a dwelling place for this group of worms, food for birds and dogs. Decaying, falling, being destroyed, such a nature, impure, impermanent, worthless, such a body is always nourished by food etc. and such a body is made to exert itself, but does not perform the extremely difficult, fierce, painful, severe austerities of penance, including knowledge-vision etc., which are rare in hundreds of births, that is called effort skillfulness.

And then, the one who is skillful in adornment is also of many types - in this way - anointing the body with oil, massaging, applying paste, getting a body massage, bathing, applying oil, rubbing away dirt, eating tambok, giving sunbath, perfuming the body with fragrant things, polishing teeth, making them soft, making the face beautiful, wearing flowers or garlands, making hair, using shoes-sandals, moving with pride, speaking, laughing, sitting, getting up, falling, pulling, wearing clothes in such a way that the adornment of the body is visible, taking a staff, all these are considered to be skillful adornment monks. This skillful monk is a destroyer of preaching, has evil consequences, has bad signs, is a skillful adornment monk who does evil deeds that are not worth seeing. Thus, the chapter on vision skillfulness is complete. Sūtra - 626

Now know that there are many types of character skillfulness in the original qualities and the subsequent qualities. Among them, the five great vows and night-time food are the six original qualities. One who is careless about those six, in that, Prāṇātipāt, i.e., killing beings with one sense, two, three, four, five senses, in the form of earth, water, fire, air, plants, causing them pain, tormenting them.

There are two types of Mṛṣāvāda - subtle and gross. In that, 'Payla Ullamarue'

One monk was sleeping during the day - eating a snack. Another monk said to him - why are you sleeping during the day? He replied that I am not sleeping. Then sleep came again. He started eating the snack, then the monk said - don't sleep. Then the reply came - I am not sleeping. So this is subtle Mṛṣāvāda.

One monk went out in the rain. Another monk said - why are you going in the rain? He said - no, I am not going in the rain. Saying this, he started going. Here, the word Vāsṛdhātu is used, so if there is a word, then I am not going. Using such deceitful words is subtle Mṛṣāvāda.

One monk said at the time of food - eat food. He replied - I am full - saying this, he immediately started eating. Another monk asked - you said you just ate, and then you eat food. Then he said - did I not deny the restraint of the five great vows, including Prāṇātipāt? In this way, this is subtle Mṛṣāvāda due to the use of deceit. Subtle Mṛṣāvāda and Kanyālik etc. are called gross Mṛṣāvāda.

Taking without giving, its two divisions are subtle and gross. Among them, taking grass, stones, Raksakundī etc. is

**In the community, there are two types of possessions:** Subtle and Gross. Protecting clothes and utensils with a sense of ownership, not giving them to others for use, is subtle possession. Accepting or possessing gold, etc., is gross possession. Owning something is gross possession.

**Measure - Thirty-two Kavals are the measure. Food is considered to be the filler of the stomach. If one eats food, etc., that is pleasing to the taste due to attachment, then the Angar defect occurs, and if one eats something unwanted due to aversion, then the Dhumra defect occurs.

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

Eating for study/purpose/sutra number is a vow. There is no pain equal to hunger, therefore eating for its peace. A weak-bodied person due to hunger cannot be capable of doing Viyayavach. Therefore, eating is necessary. If one does not search for Iryasamiti properly, cannot manage Prekshadik Samyam, the power to do Swadhyayadik decreases, strength starts to decline, and one cannot do Dharma Dhyan, therefore a Sadhu should eat for this reason. This is how to know Pind Vishuddhi. Sutra - 644

Now, five Samiti are explained as follows: Iryasamiti, Bhashasamiti, Eshanasamiti, Adanbhand-Mattaniksepan Samiti, and Ucchaar-Pasavan Khel Sindhanajallaparishthapanika Samiti. And three Gupti: Man Gupti, Vachan Gupti, and Kayagupti. And twelve Bhavana: 1. Anitya Bhavana, 2. Asharan Bhavana, 3. Ekatva Bhavana, 4. Anyatva Bhavana, 5. Ashuchi Bhavana, 6. Vichitra Sansar Bhavana, 7. Karma ke Ashrav ki Bhavana, 8. Sanvar Bhavana, 9. Nirjara Bhavana, 10. Lok Vistara Bhavana, 11. Tirthankar ne achchhi tarah se bataya hua aur achchhi tarah se prarupa hua uttam dharma ki soch saman Bhavana, 12. Karod janmantr mein durlabh aisi bodhi durlabh Bhavana.

One who is negligent in Adi Sthanantar should be known as Charitra Kusheel. Sutra - 645

Tap Kusheel is of two types: one is Baahya Tap Kusheel and the other is Abhyantar Tap Kusheel. A Muni who does various types of long-term Tapas like Upvasadik Tap, Unodarika, Vrutti Sanksepa, Ras Parityag, Kay-Klesh, Ango-pang sikude rakhne saman Sanlinata, these six types of Baahya Tap, even after having the power in them, does not make an effort, is called Baahya Tap Kusheel. Sutra - 646-647

Twelve types of Bhikku Pratima are as follows: Ek Maasiki, Do Maasiki, Teen Maasiki, Char Maasiki, Panch Maasiki, Chh Maasiki, Saat Maasiki, these seven Pratima. Aathvi Saat Aho-ratri ki, Nauvi Saat Aho-ratri ki, Dasvi Saat Aho-ratri ki, Gyarahavi Ek Aho-ratri ki, Barahvi Ek Ratri ki, these are twelve Bhikku Pratima. Sutra - 648

_ From Abhigha-dravya, Kshetra, Kal, and Bhava. In that, Dravya Abhigha, taking Umbale Undad etc. dravya, from Kshetra, taking in the village or outside the village, from Kal, taking in the first etc. Porisi, from Bhava, taking what is given by someone with Kshaya like Krodhadik, "I will take it", this is how Uttar Gun Sanksepa is summarized. By doing this, Charitra Achar is also completed in a concise way. Tapa Achar also comes in it concisely. And then Virya Achar is called that which does not consume the lesser Achar in these five Achar.

In these five Achar, whoever consumes any Atichara knowingly, intentionally, with arrogance, negligence, vow, intentionally or unintentionally, according to the sin committed, should perform the penance given by the Guru after criticism, and follow it properly. In this way, in the eighteen thousand limbs of Sheel, whoever has committed negligence in any limb, should be considered Kusheel from that negligence fault. Sutra - 649

In the same way, know about Osanna. We do not write it here. We do not write about Gyanadhik Vishayak Pasattha, Swachhand, Utsutramargagami, Shabal here due to fear of expanding the text. Wherever there are other readings, one who has known the essence of the scriptures properly, should connect the relationship with such Geetarthavarya. Because earlier, many texts were destroyed in the ideal Pratim. Wherever there was a need to connect the relationship, many Shraddha Dharas gathered together and collected the remaining Ang, Upang, Shrutaskandh, Adhyayan, Uddesham from the twelve Ang form Shruti Samudra.

Oh Gautama! These five great sins which are not renounced, just as the Śrāvaka named Sumati wandered in the world by committing sins like conversation with Kuśīla etc., they will also wander.
One who is in the state of existence and who is in the state of existence, cannot obtain the ten kinds of Dharma, characterized by enlightenment, non-violence, etc., which are in the world of great suffering. Like the parrot who lived in the hermitage of the sage and in the house of the Bhil, learned to speak sweetly from the qualities of contact and learned to speak abusive words from the defects of contact. Oh Gautama! Just as both parrots received the result of the defect of contact, in the same way, one who desires self-benefit should know the reality of this bird and completely abandon the contact of Kuśīla by all means.

O Bhagvant! How did that Sumati engage in Kushīla Samsarga, that he would wander in this terrifying, painful, and endless ocean of existence, filled with suffering, devoid of liberation, with such a terrible state of being and body? He would not attain the ten virtues of forgiveness, etc., as taught by the omniscient Bhagvant, nor would he attain Samyaktva. O Gautam! This is the story:

In this Bharatavarsha, there was a country called Magadha. In it, there was a city called Kushasthal. In that city, there were two brothers, Sumati and Nagil, who were Shravakas, who understood the nature of virtue and vice, and who had a deep understanding of the true nature of beings and their livelihood. They were both wealthy and prosperous. At one time, due to the rise of Antaray Karma, their wealth was destroyed. But their character and courage remained strong. They were steadfast in their character and courage, extremely fearful of the afterlife, free from deceit, trickery, and lies, and they practiced the four types of charity and other virtues as taught by Bhagvant. They followed the Shravaka Dharma, did not harm anyone, were humble, simple in nature, like a dwelling place for the jewels of virtue, oceans of forgiveness, friends of the virtuous, and repositories of virtue, whose virtues could be described for many days.

They experienced the rise of inauspicious karma, and their wealth became insufficient for performing rituals like the Ashtahnika Mahamahotsava, honoring the wishes of the deities, honoring the righteous, and engaging in family affairs. Sūtra-655-660

Now, when guests came to their house, they could not be properly welcomed. They could not fulfill the desires of their loved ones. Their friends, relatives, family members, kin, wives, sons, nephews, and other relations distanced themselves, forgetting their ties. Then, filled with sorrow, those Shravakas thought, "O Gautam! When a man has wealth, people obey him. Even lightning avoids a cloud without water." Thinking this, Sumati first said to his brother Nagil, "Look, a man without wealth is unfortunate. Let him go to a country where he will not find relatives or a home." The other brother also said, "People come to those who have no wealth, but those who have wealth have many relatives." Sūtra-661

Thus, they agreed with each other and decided to leave the country. They decided to go to an unknown land, thinking that if their desires were not fulfilled after a long time, they would take Diksha if it was favorable to the gods. Then, they left the city of Kushasthal and decided to go abroad. Sūtra-662

Now, as they were traveling to another country, they saw five Sadhus and a sixth Shramanopasaka on the way. Then, Nagil said to Sumati, "O Sumati! Bhadramuka, look at the company of these Sadhus. Let us also go with this community of Sadhus." He said, "Alright, let's do that." They were only traveling to a single destination when Nagil said to Sumati, "O Bhadramuka! The twenty-second Tirthankara, Shri Arishtanemi Bhagvant, who was like the emerald gem, the jewel of the Harivaṃśa, with a dark complexion, was sitting comfortably at his lotus feet. When he heard this, he determined that those who take on such an innumerable form are considered Kushīla. And those who are Kushīla should not even be seen, let alone engage in any kind of contact with them. Therefore, let them go. We will go with a smaller group. Because the Tirthankara's...

Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'
One should not violate the study/purpose/Sutra number statement. Even the gods and asuras of this world are not worthy of violating the words of the Tirthankara. Secondly, as long as they are with them, let alone their darshan, but even their conversation, etc., should be regulated; so should we go violating the words of the Tirthankara? Thinking in that way, holding the hand of Sumati, he left with the Nagil Sadhu. Sutra - 663-669
_ Seeing with his eyes, he sat on pure and lifeless ground. After that, Sumati said that the knowledge-giving guru, parents, elders and sister or where you cannot give an answer, O God! What should I say? According to their command, it is necessary to do this and accept it. Whether it is good or bad for me, there is no time to think about it. But today, in this matter, the Arya has to answer it, and that too with difficult, harsh, unpleasant, evil, cruel words. Or how can my tongue rise before my elder brother, in whose lap I have played many times with clothes without impurity, with a dirty body. Or why doesn't he himself shy away from speaking such unwanted words? That this is Kushil. And one should not even look at those Sadhus with one's eyes. As long as he himself has not thought and spoken, in the meantime, the elder brother Nagil, who is skilled in knowing the shape of the gesture, recognized his heart's feeling that this Sumati is a liar with false kashayas. So he started thinking about what kind of answer to give. Sutra-670-676
Without reason, without occasion, even if he is angry, he will not be honored even if he is not understood now. So should I explain it to him now, so that he can spend time? Time will pass, then his kashayas will be pacified and then he will accept all the things I have said. Or is this present opportunity such that I can remove his doubts. Until he is specially understood, this Bhadrak brother will not understand anything. Thinking this, Nagil said to his younger brother Sumati - O brother! I am not blaming you, I consider it my own fault that - even if a relative is told with good intentions, he becomes angry. The living being caught in the net of eight karmas is to blame here, that the teachings that take him out of the four faults do not affect him. The soul, eaten by the faults of stubborn raga, dvesha, kadagrah, ignorance, mithyatva, even nectar like teachings seem like poison to it. Sutra-677
Hearing this, Sumati said - You are the truth-speaker and can speak in this way. But it is not at all appropriate for a Sadhu to speak in an unrefined way. Why doesn't he look at the other behavior of the great soul? Six, eight, four-five fasts, massakshaman, etc., after doing penance, they take food, they suffer from heat in the summer. And then, taking different kinds of abhigrahas like virasana, utkatukasana, doing difficult penance, etc., performing religious rituals, those who have dried up the flesh and blood, it is not appropriate for you, a great speaker of the assembly, a great Shravak, to think of such a Sadhu as Kushil.
After that, Nagil said - O Vats! Don't be satisfied with his religious rituals. Just as today I have been robbed by disbelief, by the suffering of being subjected to what has come without desire, even karma is destroyed by akam nirjara, then why not karma be destroyed by balatapas? Consider all of them to be balatapaswis. Don't you see the little consumption of the Utka Sutramarg? And then, O Vats Sumati! I don't have even a subtle hatred in my mind for this Sadhu, so that I can accept his fault. But I have understood from the Tirthankara Bhagvant that you should not look at Kushil.

**Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'**

Then Sumati said to him, "Just as you are foolish, so will be the Tirthankara who told you this." After that, binding the mouth-shaped hole of Sumati, who spoke in this way, with his hand, Nagil said to him, "Do not hope for the Tirthankara Bhagvant, the great teacher of the world. Tell me what you have to say, I will not give you any reply." Then Sumati said to him, "If this Sadhu is Kushila in this world, then there will be no Sushil Sadhu anywhere." Then Nagil said, "Sumati! Here in the world, one should accept the words of Bhagvant, who has inviolable words, with respect. The Astik soul never has any discord in his words and do not respect him in his actions, because according to the words of Jinendra, he certainly appears to be Kushila.  _ There is no smell for his renunciation. Because if this Sadhu has another mouth-pot, then this Sadhu is more Kushila due to the fault of excessive attachment. Bhagvant did not command the Sadhu to hold excessive possessions in his hand. Therefore, O Vats! Even a low-minded person should not think in his mind that if my mouth-pot breaks and gets destroyed, then where will I get another one? He does not think that by holding more and useless possessions, my Pari Graha Vrat will be broken or what? Is it right for a soul who is dyed in restraint to be a means like a mouth-pot, which is an instrument of Dharma necessary for restraint? Surely such a soul does not find sorrow in it. Truly, such a soul reveals himself as a low-minded person, praises the conduct of the wrong path, and defiles the sermon. Can't you see this common reality?

This Sadhu saw the body of a woman without clothes yesterday, and he did not do Pratikraman by thinking about it with attachment, don't you know? This Sadhu has blisters on his body, and he does not see the face of the one who is amazed by it. He just took ashes without giving them to himself with his own hand to make him feel better, you have also seen them doing that directly. Yesterday, he told the Sanghatak before sunrise, "Get up and let's go, we will go for a walk." The sun has risen. Didn't you hear it yourself? The one who is a big Navadishit in this, he slept without any use and touched the electricity fire, you saw it. He did not take Santhara, then in the morning he collided with the edge of the clothes worn on the green grass, then he consumed water in the open. He walked by stepping on the seed-plant body. He walked on the salty ground illegally and then transitioned to the sweet ground. And after walking on the way, the Sadhu should do Iriyaavhiyan Pratikraman after walking a hundred steps.

One should walk in such a way, one should act in such a way, one should speak in such a way, one should sleep in such a way that the subtle or dense, sufficient or insufficient, coming and going, all living beings, Pranabhoot or Sattv, do not get collision, suffering, pain or disturbance. None of these things mentioned in these Sadhus are seen here. And then I encouraged that Sadhu to take the mouth-pot, saying that you are making a fluttering sound while taking the mouth-pot, which causes a collision of the air body. I reminded him of the reason for taking the mouth-pot. Whose restraint is like this, which is used in this way, and you follow it a lot, then there is no doubt that you have such use in it? At this time, you stopped me and said, "Keep quiet, we should not say anything to the Sadhus." Have you forgotten this reality? He did not protect even one of the Samyak Stanak in the Samyak Stanak, in which
How can a Sadhu be called a Sadhu who has such negligence? Those who have such destruction are not Sadhus. O Bhadra Mukh! See, this one who is destroying the six-sense beings like a dog, why should I have affection for him? Or even a dog is good, whose very subtle rules and vows are not broken.

How can one compare him to someone who breaks this rule? Therefore, O Vats! Sumati! One cannot become a Sadhu by such artificial conduct. Who will worship them who remember the words of Tirthankara? Another thing to keep in mind is that their contact may also make us slack in our actions, that

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Mahānishīth'

**Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number** which causes us to wander repeatedly in the terrible cycle of births.

Then Sumati said that whether he is Kushīl or Sushīl, I will take vows only with him. And then you say that is the Dharma, but who is capable of doing it today? Therefore, leave my hand, I have to go with him. If he goes far away, then meeting will be difficult. Then Nāgil said - O Bhadra Mukha! Going with him will not be your welfare, I give you words of benefit. It is more beneficial to consume that which is more virtuous than this situation. I am not holding you by force.

Now, even after many attempts to prevent it for a long time, he did not stop. And the unfortunate Sumati, O Gautam! accepted vows. After that, when time came, while wandering, after five months, a terrible twelve-year famine struck. Then that ascetic, due to the fault of that time, without doing Pratikramāṇa of the fault, died and was born as a vehicle of Bhūta, Yaksha, Rākshasa, Pishacha, etc. Vyantar Dev. Later, he became a cruel, meat-eating Mlechchha. Due to being of cruel consequences, he was born in the seventh Naraki. From there, he will attain Samyaktva in the third Chaubīsī. After attaining Samyaktva, he will attain Siddhi in the third birth, but the fifth one, who was the biggest, will not attain Siddhi. Because he is completely Mithyādṛishti and Abhavya. O Bhagavan! Is Sumati Bhavy or Abhavya? O Gautam, he is Bhavy. O Bhagavan! If he is Bhavy, then where will he be born after death? O Gautam! He will be born among the Parmadhārma Asuras. Sūtra-678

O Bhagavan! Is it true that a Bhavy Jīva is born among the Parmadhārma Asuras? O Gautam! Those who, despite being told well, disregard the best Hitopadeśa due to the arising of strong Rāga, Dvesha, Moha, and Mithyātva. They consider the twelve Angas and Śrutagyāna as unproven and do not know the harmony and difference of the scriptures. They praise and promote unrighteousness, just as Sumati praised and promoted those ascetics - "He is not a Kushīl ascetic. If even this ascetic is Kushīl, then there is no Sushīl ascetic in this world." I have decided to take vows with those ascetics, and just as you are foolish, so will those Tirthankaras be. By speaking in this way, O Gautam! even after being a great ascetic, he will be born among the Parmadhārma Asuras.

O Bhagavan! Where are the Parmadhārma Devas born after death? O Bhagavan! Where will the Jīva of Sumati go after leaving the Parmadhārma Asura Devas? O Gautam! This unfortunate one, by praising and promoting unrighteousness, approved the destruction of the entire righteous path. Due to the fault of that karma, he earned an endless cycle of births.

Did you say the origin of births? I will tell you some births briefly, even though there is no way to escape from the four Gatis, the same cycle of births, for many Padgal Paravartan Kālas. Listen -

There is a salty ocean surrounding this Jambudvīpa, which is slowly circular. In that place where the Sindhu Mahānādī enters, in the south direction of that region, there is a place called Prati Santapa Dayak, which is twelve and a half Yojanas in size, like the shape of an elephant's trunk, in the middle of a Vedikā that is fifty-five Yojanas in size. That place is seven and a half Yojanas high from the water of the salty ocean. There are forty-six caves in that place, with a sky of a very dark, dense, and dark hour institution. In those caves, there are water-dwelling humans, two by two. They are the ones who are Vajraṛishbhanārch Sanghayanavala, with great strength and power, with a body of twelve and a half Ventas, with a lifespan of countless years, who love liquor and meat. By nature, they are lustful towards women, very dark in complexion, delicate, evil, hard, stony-bodied, with a terrifying face like the leader of the Chandals, with a fierce gaze like a lion, terrifying like Yama Raja, who do not show their backs to anyone, who strike fiercely like lightning, who are proud of being Mānḍhāta. Such are those egg-shaped humans.

By taking the inner golika in their body, they are born from the white tail hair of a cow.

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

The students/purpose/sutra numbers weave golikai (beads). After that, they tie the woven golikai to both ears and enter the ocean with the desire to obtain precious, excellent, caste-born gems. The water, elephants, buffaloes, lizards, crocodiles, large fish, dolphins, etc., in the ocean do not cause any harm to them. Due to the influence of the golikai, they roam freely in all the ocean water without fear, collect excellent caste-born gems as per their desire, and emerge with an intact body.

Oh Gautam! They experience the unbearable, extremely intense, terrifying suffering, which is the result of the extremely fierce karma accumulated in their previous births, due to the connection with the inner golikai.

Oh Bhagvant! Why is that? Oh Gautam! Who can be capable of taking their golikai while they are alive? When they take the golikai from their body, they have to control themselves with great courage and many kinds of bravery. Many brave men, wearing armor, armed with swords, spears, chakras, and weapons, capture them alive using their intelligence. The kind of physical and mental suffering they experience when they are captured is compared to the suffering of hell.

Oh Bhagvant! Who takes their inner golikai? Oh Gautam! In that salt ocean, there is an inner island called Ratnadeep, which is 3100 yojanas away from the place of suffering. Humans from Ratnadeep take it. Oh Bhagvant! How do they take it? They capture them according to the tradition received from the previous men who were perfected by the nature of the field. Oh Bhagvant! What is the method perfected by their previous men? Oh Gautam! In that Ratnadeep, there are excellent vajrashila (diamond) containers in the shape of a mill, measuring 20, 19, 18, 10, 8, and 7 dhanushya (bows). Separating them, the humans of Ratnadeep, using the yoga perfected by the nature of the field, prepared by the previous men, collect many fish and honey, make them very sweet, and then add pieces of cooked meat, excellent wine, and other things. They prepare a suitable mixture for their food, sit in a vehicle made of the wood of a large, tall tree, and consume many tumbas (containers) filled with delicious old wine, meat, fish, and honey, and come near the place called Prati-Santapa-dayak.

When they give one tumba to the egg-shaped human living in the cave and use the method of request and plea, they drive the worthy wooden vehicle with great speed towards Ratnadeep.

The egg-shaped human consumes the mixture of honey, meat, etc., from the tumba, and because it tastes extremely delicious, they run after them separately to get more. Then, Gautam! Before they come very close, they place a tumba of old wine, flavored with delicious honey and fragrant substances, on the way and again move towards Ratnadeep with great speed. And then, the egg-shaped human runs after them with great skill to get the delicious, honey-flavored, fragrant, prepared old wine, meat, etc. They place a tumba filled with honey for them. In this way, Gautam! They trap them with the wine and liquor from the tumba until they reach the place where the previously mentioned vajrashila containers in the shape of a mill are located. When they reach the mill and enter it, Gautam! They see the previously cooked pieces of meat, the food filled with wine and liquor, and the honey-coated stone slab, and they experience great satisfaction, joy, great contentment, and great pleasure.

In this way, while eating wine, liquor, and cooked meat, they spread out for seven to eight, fifteen days. During this time, the residents of Ratnadeep gather, some wearing armor, some armed, and they surround the vajrashila in seven to eight rows, holding it tightly. Then, some other humans from Ratnadeep, using a ghantal (bell), ...

They gather at the study/purpose/sūtra number. When two millstones are brought together, then O Gautama! by striking a clap, in the time of its third part, one or two humans trapped inside come out. After that, the Ratnadvīpa residents build temples and palaces there along with trees. At that time, the time of destruction of his bone-body arises. In that way, O Gautama! when they grind and grind by crushing him between the two millstones of the Vajrashīla, until all the bones are crushed and well ground into powder, then the life of the Andagolika does not separate. His bones are as strong as Vajraratna, difficult to grind. There, they place him between the two millstones of the Vajrashīla and, with black bulls yoked, they grind him round like a rent with great effort.

Even after a year of grinding effort, his strong bones do not break. At that time, even after experiencing the intense, terrible, excruciating pain of physical and mental suffering, even after the life has departed, his bones do not break, do not split, do not grind, do not wear away, but the joints and places of binding all separate and become dilapidated. After that, seeing some bone fragments of the fingers and other forelimbs like flour that slips like a normal stone mill, the Ratnadvīpa residents rejoice, lift the millstones, take the Andagolika, take many wealth groups from the dry-arid part of it, and sell it. In this way, the Ratnadvīpa residents take the human Andagolika.

O Bhagavant! How will those poor souls sustain their life for a year without food and water, enduring such intense, terrible, sharp, unbearable suffering? O Gautama! One who desires to know the special right of this from the experience of one's own karma, should know it from the detailed explanation of the Praśna Vyākaraṇa Sūtra. Sūtra - 679

O Bhagavant! Where will the soul of that Sumati be born after dying there? O Gautama! He will be born in the same place called Prati-saṁtāpa-dāya, in the same order, in the form of an Andagolika human for seven births. After that, in the birth of a wicked dog, then in a black dog, then in a Vāṇavyantar, then in a Neem tree, then in the form of a female gem, then in the sixth Naraki, then a leprous human, then a Vāṇavyantar, then a Maha-kāya-vāla Yuthādhipati elephant, there, due to excessive attachment in copulation, he will become an Ananta-kāya plant, there he will endure the suffering of birth and death for an infinite time, and become a human. Then, in human form, he will again go to the Mahānimi, then to the seventh, then he will become a large fish in the self-wandering ocean. He will die after eating many creatures, and go to the seventh.

After that, he will become an Ānkhalā, then a human, then a cuckoo on a tree, then a Jalo, then a Maha-matsy, then a Tandu-matsy, then the seventh, then a donkey, then a dog, then a Kṛmi-jīva, then a frog, then in the Agni-kāya, then a Kunthu, then a honeybee, then a bird, then an Udhai, then in a plant, after an infinite time like this, he will become a human, then a female gem, then the sixth, then a camel, then in the town called Veṣāmaṅkita, near the house of the Upādhyāya, he will become a Neem tree, then a human, then a small hunchbacked woman, then a eunuch, then a suffering human, then a beggar, then in the Prithvī-kāya and other bodies, he will suffer the fate of birth and the fate of the body in each, then a human, then an ignorant ascetic, then a Vāṇavyantar, then a Purohita, then the seventh, then a Tandu-matsy, then the seventh Naraki, then a bull, then a human, then a Mahā-samyag-dṛṣṭi Avirati Chakravarti, then the first Naraki, then a wealthy merchant, then a Śramaṇa Anagāra, from there to the Anuttar Devaloka, then becoming a Chakravarti Mahā-saṁgha-yaṇa-vāla, he will attain dispassion from the enjoyment of desires, and becoming a Tīrthaṅkara Bhagavant, he will practice the complete restraint as described, and attain his Nirvana.

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Mahānishītha'

**Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number**  Those who speak such words, enter the temples and houses of the Nihnvas, who model the scriptures, śāstras, verses or letters of the Nihnvas, who perform austerities like modeled body-afflictions, etc., who practice restraint, who practice their knowledge, who recognize it in a special way, who listen, who become learned, who advocate for it, who praise it or its śāstra in the company of the learned, even they are born as Asuras in the form of Paramādharmic Sumati. Sūtra - 681

**O Bhagvant!** Why did the soul of that Sumati have to wander in the world for so long in different births in such hellish, animal, human, Asura, etc. states, even though he had embraced Śramaṇapan at that time? **O Gautama!** If such things as linga-vesha, etc. are adopted, which hinder the Āgama, then it is only a show and is considered to be the cause of a very long world. How long its limit is, cannot be told, for the same reason (according to Āgama) restraint is considered difficult.

**Then, on the other hand, keep this in mind:** For Śramaṇapan, one has to abandon the Kusīla Samsargī in the place of restraint. If one does not abandon it, then restraint itself does not last. So, the virtuous Sadhu should follow the same conduct, praise the same, promote the same, advise the same, follow the same, which is in the Āgama-śāstra as told by Bhagvant. In this way, by transgressing the Sūtra, just as Sumati wandered in the long world, in the same way, others like Sundar, Vidur, Sudarśan, Śekhar, Nilabhadra, Sabhomeya, Khaggadhārī, Stenaśramaṇa, Durdāntadeva, Rakshit Muni, etc. have also gone astray. How many of them can be counted? Therefore, knowing the ultimate purpose of this matter, one should completely abandon Kusīla Samsarg. Sūtra-682

**O Bhagvant!** Did the Nāgil Śrāvaka tell those five Sadhus in the Kusīla form of their own free will or by the means of the Āgama śāstra? **O Gautama!** What ability would the poor Śrāvaka have to say such a thing? When the Śrāvaka, who spoke the Avarnāvāda of the great virtuous Sadhu out of his own free will, was in the presence of the twenty-second Dharma Tīrthankara, Ariṣṭanemi, who was like the emerald gem, the crest jewel of the Harivaṃśa lineage, with a dark complexion. He had gone to him for the purpose of paying homage. He had been modeled by the Kevali Bhagvant, the knower of Anantagamaparva, in the Ācārāṅga Sūtra. He had truly understood it in his heart. There, he had declared thirty-six Āchāras. Of those Āchāras, whoever, whether a Sadhu or a Sadhvī, violates any Āchāra, is considered to be equal to a householder. If one behaves, conducts oneself, or models oneself against the Āgama, then one is an Ananta Ansārī.

Therefore, **O Gautama!** Whoever has taken more than one-mouthed cloth, his fifth Mahāvrata has been broken. Whoever has seen the limbs of a woman, thought about it, and then did not criticize it, has violated the secrecy of Brahmacharya. Just as a burnt cloth is called a burnt cloth in one part, in the same way, here the fourth Mahāvrata is said to be broken. Whoever has picked up ashes with his own hands, accepted it without giving it, his third Mahāvrata has been broken. Whoever has said that the sun has risen before sunrise, his second Mahāvrata has been broken. The Sadhu who has cleaned his eyes with living water and has crossed from one land to another in the path of the land without the proper time. The seed-body has collided with the plant-body from the edge of the cloth. The touch of lightning. The violation of the air-body by the mouth-lord due to the flapping sound from the un-eaten. All of them have broken their first Mahāvrata. By their breaking, the five Mahāvrata have been broken. Therefore, **O Gautama!** These Sadhus have been called Kusīla by the Āgama method. Because the breaking of the Uttaraguṇa is also not desirable, then the breaking of the Mūlaguṇa is completely undesirable.

**O Bhagvant!** So, should one accept Mahāvrata only after thinking about this example? **O Gautama!** This is the truth, O

**Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number**

O Bhagvant! For what reason? O Gautama! These two distinctions, Sushraman or Sushravak, have been explained. The third distinction has not been explained. Either, O Bhagvant, follow Sushramanapan as instructed in the scriptures. Similarly, Sushravakapan should be followed truthfully. But the Shraman should not allow excess in his Shramanapan, or the Shravak should not allow excess in his Shravakapan. Niratichar Vrat is praiseworthy. One should follow Niratichar Vrat. This Shraman Dharma, being of the form of Sarvavirati, is free from change, without any thought, and with complete deliberation. As the observance of Mahavrat is explained in the scriptures, it should be followed truthfully. Whereas, for the Shravak, there are thousands of rules. He should observe the Vrat and not allow excess in it. In this way, the Shravak should adopt Anuvrat. Sūtra - 683

**O Bhagvant! Where was that Nagil Shravak born?**

O Gautama! He went to Siddhi Gati.

**O Bhagvant! How?**

O Gautama! The noble Nagil, separating himself from that Kusil Sadhu, in a dense, terrifying forest filled with many Shravaks and trees, considering the words of the Tirthankar Bhagvant, the ultimate benefactor, free from the stain of all sins and impurities, extremely rare even in hundreds of births, adopted Niratichar Padupopagaman Anashan, in a lifeless region where he did not have to worry about his body. Now, at some time, Arishta Nemit, who was wandering in that same region, came to this glorious soul, who was steadfast and unwavering, for his benefit. He spoke the most excellent, profound, and enlightening words, which were like a means of attaining Samadhi and death. Hearing the words of the Tirthankar, which were as deep as a rain-filled cloud and as beautiful as the sound of a divine drum, he attained the क्षपक श्रेणी (Kshapak Shreni) through the power of the अपूर्वकरण (Apuvarkaran). He became a Kevali in the end. He attained Siddhi. Therefore, O Gautama! There is such a difference between one who abandons the Kusil Samsargi.

**Study-4-The Muni Diparatnasagar's Hindi Translation is Complete**

In this fourth study, the Siddhantagyatas do not have true faith in some speakers. They remain faithless, therefore, we also do not have true faith. This is the statement of Acharya Haribhadrasuriji. Understand that not only this entire fourth study, but also other studies, have a sense of disbelief in some limited speakers of this fourth study. Because, in the Sūtras of Sthān, Samavāya, Jīvābhigaman, Prajñāpanā, etc., no truth is revealed about the place of the Prati Santapaka. There are humans who live in its cave. In it, the Parmadharmic Asura creates havoc seven or eight times. They have to be ground between the millstones of the Darun Vajrashila. Even after being ground excessively, their life does not end for a year. (But) the Vṛddhavāda is such that it is an Ārshasūtra, there is no distortion in it. There is a lot of meaning in this Shruta Skandha. These are the words of the Ganadhar, spoken with beautiful, excessive, and extraordinary qualities. Therefore, do not doubt here easily.

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'
Study/Purpose/Sutra Number Study-5-Navaneet Saar Sutra-684-685
This way, by abandoning the worldly attachments with all efforts, those who enter the right path and earn their livelihood through a particular profession and reside in that particular path, do not attain freedom from obstacles, effortless asceticism, self-control, austerity, and beautiful emotions. Not only that, but liberation also remains far away from them. Sutra-686-691

O Gautam! There are beings who reside in the path that leads to liberation and wander in the cycle of birth and death. Even though they reside in the Guru's abode for half a night, a night, a day, a fortnight, a month, or a year, those who are pleasure-seeking, lazy, or have a dull mind or heart, O Gautam! Even those with a dull enthusiasm, upon seeing the side of such a noble and virtuous ascetic, become eager to perform all actions with great effort. And then, witnessing, doubt, fear, and shame, their energy becomes aroused. O Gautam! When the energy of a being is aroused, it burns the karmas performed in past lives with the emotions of the heart. Therefore, one should carefully examine the path that leads to liberation and reside in it with a controlled monk for the rest of their life. Sutra-692

O Bhagvant! Which paths are suitable for residing in? O Gautam! The path where there is an equal attitude towards both enemies and friends. The path where there are ascetics with a very pure and clear inner consciousness, who are afraid of indulging in desires, who are dedicated to the welfare of their own and others' souls, who have immense compassion for all the six categories of beings, who are free from all distractions, who are extremely vigilant and specifically identified, who are harmonious with the scriptures, who are free from anger and sorrow, who do not hide their strength, energy, determination, and courage, who are worthy of a solitary ascetic, who are simple in their clothes and other possessions, who do not indulge in them, who are afraid of hindering the practice of solitude, who are interested in the truth, who are eager to perform actions, who do not engage in stories of women, food, thieves, kings, countries, or those who have deviated from the right conduct in solitude, who are free from all kinds of strange, incomprehensible, and all kinds of false stories in solitude, who are devoted to the 18,000 precepts as much as possible, who are constantly engaged in the practice of the path of liberation according to the scriptures day and night, who are endowed with many virtues, who remain on the path without any slip-ups, who are holders of unbroken virtuous conduct, who are highly praised, who are highly respected, who are noble and virtuous, who are endowed with the qualities of knowledge, perception, and character, and who are such virtuous Acharyas. The path where such virtuous Acharyas reside is called a 'Gachch'. Sutra-693

O Bhagvant! Does one receive the benefit of residing in the Guru's abode by residing in it? O Gautam! Yes, some ascetics definitely receive the benefit of residing in the Guru's abode by residing in it, and there are some who do not reside in such a path. O Bhagvant! Why is it said that some reside and some do not? O Gautam! One soul is a devotee of the Guru's commands, and another is a rebel against the Guru's commands. The one who abides by the Guru's commands is a devotee of right faith, knowledge, and conduct, and they, O Gautam! are extremely knowledgeable and strive in various ways on the path of liberation. The one who does not follow the Guru's commands, who rebels against the commands, is filled with the four poisons of anger, deceit, pride, and greed. They are filled with the accumulations of attachment, aversion, delusion, and false belief. Those who are deeply immersed in attachment, aversion, delusion, and false belief are like those who cannot be compared, who wander in the terrible ocean of the world. Those who wander in the terrible ocean of the world have to experience birth, old age, and death again and again, and then they have to be reborn in the 84 lakh species again and again.

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

To enter the lineage of a womb, which is enveloped in the most unbearable, intense, deep, dark darkness, smeared with blood, fat, pus, vomit, bile, phlegm, foul-smelling, impure flowing, and filled with lungs, excrement, urine, etc., causing distress, extremely severe, fierce, and terrifying with wrathful suffering, is indeed sorrow, distress, disease, and terror. It is grief, anguish, and anxiety, causing unrest. Due to this unrest, it leads to the non-attainment of desired aspirations. Due to the non-attainment of desired aspirations, five types of obstructing karma arise.

Where five types of karma arise, there arises the first poverty, which is the root of all suffering. Where there is poverty, there are many forms of suffering like disgrace, false accusations, defamation, and stigma. When such suffering arises, the being becomes shameful, blameworthy, contemptible, causing casteism, creating obstacles, and defeated by all. Such a being is far removed from right faith, knowledge, conduct, and other virtues. The human birth becomes futile, or one completely loses faith in religion.

Therefore, one becomes completely detached from right faith, knowledge, conduct, and other virtues. One cannot stop the inflow of karma. One cannot close the door of inflow. One becomes the abode of great sinful karma. One becomes bound by karma. Being bound, one becomes subservient like a prisoner in a jail, trapped in the web of all inauspiciousness and misfortune. It is very difficult to escape from this, as one cannot break the knot of harsh, deep, bound, touched, and exhausted karma. Due to this, one suffers various physical and mental pains in the states of one-sense, two-sense, three-sense, four-sense, five-sense, hellish, animal, and human. One has to suffer such misery.

Therefore, O Gautam! It is said that there are some souls who, while residing in the Gachch of the Gītārt, receive the benefits of the Guru-kula, but do not receive any benefits. Sutra-694

O Bhagvant! Are there any Gachch who practice falsehood? O Gautam! Any Gachch who are ignorant and oppose the teachings are surely engaged in the practice of falsehood. O Bhagvant! What is the command that makes a Gachch a devotee? O Gautam! The command of the Gachch is stated as the transfer of the infinite number of places. In which there is a devotee. Sutra-695

O Bhagvant! In the transfer of the infinite number of places of the Gachch, is there any transfer that, even if it repeatedly violates the rules or commands due to negligence, carelessness, or exception, is still considered a devotee? O Gautam! Surely, that is not a devotee. O Bhagvant! Why do you say so? O Gautam! The Tirthankara performs the pilgrimage, and then the Tirthankara, with four castes, is established in the Shraman Sangh Gachch. In the Gachch, right faith, knowledge, and conduct are also established. This right faith, knowledge, and conduct are worthy of refuge in the highest respect. They are also suitable for the three special services in the highest service. Anyone who opposes these refuge-worthy, respectable, and serviceable, in any way, in any place, in any Gachch, is a destroyer of the right path, a preacher of the wrong path. In the Gachch where the right path is destroyed and the wrong path is preached, surely there is a violation of the command. Therefore, O Gautam! It is said that in the infinite number of places of the Gachch, there is a transfer of rules. Anyone in the Gachch who violates the rules or commands in one or more places is a violator of the single command.

Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number Sūtra-696
O Bhagvant! For how long is the Gachch's boundary? For how long should the Gachch not violate the boundary? O Gautam! As long as the Maha Yashas, Maha Sattvas, Mahānubhavas are Duppasah Anagar, then for that long, the Gachch's boundary is to be maintained. That is, until the end of the fifth Āre, the Gachch boundary should not be violated. Sūtra-697
O Bhagvant! By what signs is the violation of the boundary indicated? It is said that there is a lot of Āshātana and the Gachch has entered the wrong path - should this be considered? O Gautam! One who repeatedly changes Gachch, does not remain stable in one Gachch, behaves according to their own will, has attachment to bed, bedding, and other things, has external Prānas that are not subdued, enjoys water with a mind, is unaware of the five faults of the Maṇḍalī and consumes those faults, violates the time of all necessary actions, does not perform the necessary Pratikramṇa, does not perform the necessary actions in the right amount, has less or more Rajoharaṇa than the prescribed amount, wears the wrong kind of Pātra, Daṇḍa, Muhpattī, etc., uses the Guru's equipment, contradicts the Uttarguṇa, acts according to the desires of the householder, acts in their honor, causes harm to Earth, water, fire, air, plants, Bījakāya, Trasakāya, two, three, four, five-sensed beings due to carelessness or without reason, does not see the fault in causing harm, engages in Ārambh Parigraha, does not criticize in front of the Guru, speaks untruth, wanders around without time, collects things illegally, gives Pravrajyā without testing, gives a big initiation, does not teach the ten types of Vinaya Samāchārī, engages in Ṛiddhi, Rasa, Shāta, Gārava, does not establish the eight types of Mad, four types of Kṣaya, Mamattvabhāva, Ahankāra, Kaṅkāsa, Klesha, fights, quarrels, storms, Roudrārtadhyāna, disrespects the elders by saying "Hey, two" with a hand gesture, becomes lax after a long time, learns Vidya, Mantra, Tantra, Yoga, Anjana, etc., and then tries to do it alone, does not carry the Yoga of the Mūlasūtra and the Ganī Padavī, takes refuge in calamities like famine, buys and consumes cooked food, etc., is ready to get treatment for a small illness by exaggerating the cause, happily invites such work, sleeps during the day if they are sick, speaks and imitates with a desire for praise, follows the words and rituals that come out of the mouth of the Agītartha, carries out many faults, carries weapons like swords, bows, daggers, arrows, spears, discs, etc., wanders around by abandoning the Sadhu's attire and wearing other attire, such a Gachch is considered unstable up to three and a half Koṭi, O Gautam! And other types of Gachch with signs can be summarized. Sūtra-698
Such a Gachch with great qualities is recognized in this way - the Guru is like a mother who has affection for all beings, creatures, and Bhūta Sattvas in the world, then where is the affection for the Gachch incomplete? And then, to benefit the disciple and the community in solitude, to give the path of light and the happiness of the afterlife, such a Gachch gives Āgamānusārī Hitopadeśa. The teachings of the Guru Mahārāja are superior and better than the attainment of the prosperity of Devenndra and Narenndra. The Guru Mahārāja teaches with compassion for the suffering souls of the world, these Bhavyas are suffering a lot from birth, old age, death, etc. When will they attain the eternal Shiva-Sukha? The Guru Mahārāja teaches with compassion, but not by becoming defeated by addiction or trouble. As if the planet has a bad influence, they have become insane, they have a desire for revenge, as if they will get some benefit from giving this Hitopadeśa, such greed arises, then O Gautam! The Guru and the disciple do not cross the ocean of the world, and the relationship of all good and bad deeds done by others,

## Study/Purpose/Sutra Number
Aagam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith' does not exist for anyone.
Sutra - 699-700
So, O Gautam! If such circumstances arise, and there are steadfast, virtuous, and highly qualified Gurus, who repeatedly say things like, "Put your finger in the mouth of this serpent and tell me its size," or "How many teeth are in its jaw? Count them and tell me," then they should act accordingly. They are the ones who know the work. Sutra-701-702
Those who know the Aagam, even if they say "white crow," should trust the Acharya's words. There will be a reason for such a statement. Those who accept the Guru's words with a happy and receptive mind, find them as beneficial as a medicinal drink. Sutra-703
Bhavyas, who are blessed with the fruits of their past good deeds, become recipients of knowledge and other forms of wealth. Those who are destined for future well-being, worship the Guru like a deity. Sutra - 704-706
There are countless Acharyas, who provide millions of comforts and liberate from hundreds of sorrows. Keshi Gandhar and the Pradesh Raja are prominent examples. The Pradesh Raja had prepared himself for hell, but due to the influence of the Acharya, he attained a divine chariot. Acharyas are virtuous, beautiful, sweet-spoken, and explain cause, effect, and analogies. They inspire their disciples by making their hearts happy with such words. Sutra - 707-708
There are 55 crore, 55 lakh, 55 thousand, 5 hundred, and 55 crore Acharyas. Among them, there are those who are highly qualified and possess a multitude of virtues, who are like Tirthankaras in their excellence and are true Guru-Acharyas. Sutra- 709
Those, O Gautam! are like the words of a deity. Like the sun, other Acharyas should be worshipped with the same devotion as the twenty-four Tirthankaras. Sutra - 710
To attain the position of an Acharya, one must study the twelve-fold scripture. However, I will now summarize it in essence. It is as follows: Sutra - 711-712
Muni, Sangha, Tirth, Gan, Pravachan, Mokshamarg - these are words that convey the same meaning. Darshan, Gyan, Charitra, Ghor, Ugra Tap - these are all synonyms for Gachch. One should know that a Gachch where the Guru inspires the disciple with Sarana, etc., with attachment, aversion, or ill intentions, or where they intimidate the disciple, is not a true Gachch, O Gautam! Sutra - 713-720
Those who reside in such a Gachch, experience great purification. They are freed from the faults of Sarana, Vayana, Choyana, etc. Those who follow the Guru's mind, are extremely humble, conquer their senses, are patient, steadfast, not greedy, not arrogant, do not speak falsehoods, and are forgiving. They are like the senses...

Those who suppress the study/purpose/sutra number, who are content, who protect the six kayas, who are immersed in the path of detachment, who consume the ten types of Samachari, who perform the necessary, who strive in restraint, who are humiliated hundreds of times with harsh, severe, rough, unpleasant, wicked, cruel words. Even if such behavior is done, those who do not become angry, those who do not slander, those who do not defame or do wrong. Even if their throat is choked, they do not behave in such a way as to disrespect the discourse. Those who are constantly immersed in self-study and meditation, those who have bodies worn out by severe penance and walking, from whom anger, pride, and delusion have gone, and who have completely renounced attachment and hatred from afar, who are skilled in humility and courtesy, who are skilled in speaking sixteen types of words with purity, who speak faultless words, who are of a nature not to speak much, who do not speak repeatedly, who are submissive, who answer 'I wish' even if the Guru has spoken harsh, difficult, rough, cruel, unpleasant words with or without reason, such qualities are found in the disciple in the Gachch.

**Sutra-721-723**

Completely abandoning the feeling of possessiveness in places of travel and journeys, those who are detached even from their own body, who take food only for the sake of maintaining restraint, and that food is also free from 42 defects, not for the nourishment of the senses through the form of the body, even while eating, they do not become proud of getting suitable food for themselves, but only for the sake of bearing the restraint, for the sake of following Iryasamiti, for the sake of Vyavachch, they eat. They eat because they cannot bear the pain of hunger, for the sake of following Iryasamiti, for the sake of Padilhan etc. restraint.

**Sutra-724-725**

The disciple who has great effort in acquiring and retaining unprecedented knowledge, who knows the Sutra, the meaning, and both, and who always strives, the eight of Jnanaachar, the eight of Darshanachar, the eight of Charitraachar (twelve of Tapaachar), and the thirty-six of Viryaachar, who strives with great concentration of mind, speech, and body without hiding strength and vigor in them, such a disciple is in the Gachch.

**Sutra-726**

Even if the Guru Maharaj reprimands hundreds of times with harsh, severe, cruel words, the disciple who does not respond in the Gachch is called a Gachch.

**Sutra-727**

Even if one has attained unimaginable gains and extraordinary powers due to the effect of penance, the disciple who does not disrespect the Guru in the Gachch is called a Gachch.

**Sutra-728**

Even if a disciple has once defeated a group of difficult hypocrites, earned a group of glories, and does not disrespect the Guru in the Gachch, he is called a Gachch.

**Sutra-729**

Those who speak in such a way that the letters do not mix with each other, those who do not speak in such a way that the letters are crooked, those who have pure words and letters, those who have found the twelve parts of the Sutra and Shrutagyan with humility and respect, are the Gachch.

The Gachchha where the mutual salutation ritual between the young and old is maintained, where the rules of the Mandalika like Pratikramana are known expertly, where there are gurus with unblemished conduct, and where there are sadhus who are constantly striving to perform intense tapasya.

If a person practices the conduct of a Muni in a single area for a hundred years, they are an Aradhak.

A woman who places the Patra (bowl) in the assembly of Sadhus during meals is a Stri Rajya, but not a Gachchha.
**Sutra-768**
A Gachchha where a Sadhvi has to travel a hundred hands (approximately 50 meters) upwards at night, should have at least four Sadhvis, and ideally ten. If Sadhvis do not travel like this, it is not a Gachchha.
**Sutra-769-770**
If there are less than four Sadhvis in a Gachchha, even with exceptions and reasons, and they travel in a single village, what kind of Gachchha is it? O Gautam! If there are less than eight Sadhus in a Gachchha who travel with Sadhvis, even with exceptions, where is the Maryada (discipline) in that Gachchha?
**Sutra-771**
If there is arousing of the Chakshur Agnagni (fire of the eye) with 63 Bhedas (divisions), and the Sadhu-Sadhvi look at each other in that way, what Maryada is maintained for the Gachchha?
**Sutra-772**
If a Sadhu uses the Patra, Danda (staff), and other equipment belonging to an Arya, O Gautam! How can it be called a Gachchha?
**Sutra-773, 774**
If a Sadhvi obtains rare medicines that increase strength, intelligence, and nourish the body, and a Sadhu uses them, how can there be Maryada in that Gachchha?
Shashka, Bhask, even hearing the movement of sister Sukumalik, do not trust a Shreyarthi (aspirant) or a religious person easily (regarding Mohaniya Karma).

A Gachchha is not a Gachchha if anyone other than the Acharya and the elder of the Gachchha with strong character and a group of qualities gives orders to a Sadhu or Sadhvi.
**Sutra-776**
Just as one cannot recognize the sound of thunder, the wind produced in the belly of a running horse called Kuhuka, or lightning, similarly, one cannot recognize the fickle and deep mind of an Arya. If they are not prevented from doing wrong by the Gachchha Nayak, it is a Stri Rajya but not a Gachchha.
**Sutra-777**
A Gachchha where a Sadhvi works who is like the Shruta Devi, who has received direct knowledge from Indra, who is endowed with Tapollabdhi (spiritual attainment), is a Stri Rajya but not a Gachchha.

O Gautama! If there is even a slight lapse in any of the five great vows, three guptis, five samitis, and ten types of sadhudharma, then it is not a gachchha. Sutra-779-780
A newly initiated dramak sadhu, who has been initiated for only one day, is worthy of respect and humility from a chirdikshit arya Chandanbala sadhvi, who stands in front of him and does not sit on the seat. This is the humility of all aryas. Even if a sadhvi has been initiated for a hundred years and a sadhu has been initiated only one day ago, the sadhu is still worthy of respect from the sadhvi with a heart full of devotion. Sutra-781-784
Those who are greedy for the things received by sadhus and sadhvis and are dissatisfied with what they themselves receive, are like the Arnikaputra Acharya, who was broken by bhikchacharya. He had sent his disciples to a dry region during a famine, but he himself was unable to perform bhikchacharya due to old age. This fact was not known to the sinner. And they seek the benefit of the aryas. They do not accept the qualities that are worthy of being accepted from them. For example, during a famine, they made the disciples travel to the vihar. They abandoned their affection for the disciples and stayed there permanently. Instead of thinking about this, they talk about staying permanently in one area. There are many objects of attachment in this world. The careless and ignorant beings see such objects of attachment in the world and act accordingly. Sutra-785
Where the munis are cursed and harassed by great kshayas, even a lame man who is sitting well does not get up. Similarly, one whose kshayas are not aroused is called a gachchha.
Sutra-786
A muni who is afraid of the obstacles to dharma, afraid of the womb of the world, should not arouse the kshayas of other munis. That is a gachchha.
Sutra-787
Many geetarthas who are afraid of the four types of obstacles to dharma - dana, shila, tapa, and bhavana - and afraid of bhava, should reside in a gachchha.
Sutra-788
A muni who does not become angry even at those who commit offenses, seeing and recognizing the four types of beings suffering the results of their karma, is a gachchha.
Sutra-789-790
O Gautama! If there is even one of the five vadhasthanas (chakki-sambila-chulha-panihari-jhadu) in a gachchha, then one should leave that gachchha and go to another gachchha of the second type of Voshira. One should not reside in a gachchha that has vadhasthanas and is bright with hair from the beginning. One should reside in a gachchha that is bright with the qualities of character. Sutra-791
One who violates the command of an acharya who is like a prati-malla and a tirthankara, who is a conqueror of the eight karmas, which are like strong wrestlers, is a coward, not a virtuous man.

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, ‘Mahānishīth’
Study/Purpose/Sūtrāṅka Sūtra - 792-793
Those who commit corruption, those who neglect corruption, and those who remain on the wrong path are the destroyers of the three paths. If the Ācārya remains on a false path, and creates a model of the wrong path, then surely the group of Bhavyas will follow that false path, therefore do not even take the shadow of a wrong-path Ācārya. Sūtra - 794-795
In this world, one should understand that a being who is suffering is awakened and established on the path, and he has caused the proclamation of the Amari Padha in the world of Devas and Asuras. In the past, present, and future, there have been, are, and will be such great souls whose feet are worthy of being worshipped by the beings of the world, and whose time is spent in solitary effort to benefit others. O Gautama! This has happened in the past, from time immemorial. It will also happen in the future, that the mere remembrance of their names will surely bring about atonement.
Sūtra-796-799
This kind of Gaccha arrangement will continue until the time of the Duppasah Suri, but anyone who refutes it in the middle of that time should surely be known as an eternal wanderer. The atonement that is incurred by the one who destroys the Gaccha arrangement is the same as the atonement incurred by the one who destroys the perfect, non-troublesome, Siddhi-pada, which is for the benefit and well-being of all beings in the world. Therefore, one who has an equal mind towards enemies and friends, who is eager to benefit others, who desires well-being, and who is himself obedient to the Ācārya's commands, should not violate the Ācārya's commands.
Sūtra-800-803
Many Ācāryas, attached to the three Garvas, even today cannot attain the true path of Bodhi, by violating the Gaccha arrangement. Others will also wander in the four Gati-rupa Bhavas and in the world for countless times, but will not attain Bodhi. And they will remain in the painful world for a long time. O Gautama! There is not even a space as small as the tip of a hair in the fourteen-raj-praman Lokas where this being has not experienced death countless times. There are eighty-four lakh places where beings are born, and there is not a single Yoni, O Gautama!, where all beings have not been born countless times.
Sūtra-804-806
A red-hot needle, like fire, is applied to the body, and the pain that is felt is eight times greater in the womb. When a being is born from the womb and comes out, the pain of being squeezed through the Yoni-yantra is crores or kroda-krores times greater than the pain of being born and the pain of death. At the time of death, one forgets even his own caste in the experience of pain.
Sūtra-807-810
O Gautama! If one remembers the suffering of the consequences of wandering in different types of Yonis, one cannot live. Oh! Leave aside the matter of birth, old age, death, misfortune, and disease. But who, with a great intellect, will not be ashamed of the womb and not be awakened? Who can bear to be in a womb that is full of blood, dirty, foul-smelling, full of excrement, and not even pleasant to look at, and that has a foul odor? Therefore, one should not violate the command that leads to the destruction of solitary suffering and the attainment of solitary happiness. Where will happiness come to one who violates the command?

Agam Sutra 39, Cheda Sutra-5, 'Mahanisitha'
Study/Purpose/Sutra Number Sutra-811
O Bhagavan! Uttsarga has prohibited the movement of eight sadhus or four sadhus with an exception. And Uttsarga has prohibited going beyond one hundred hands with less than ten Samyati or four Samyati with an exception. Then in the last time of the fifth Ara, the solitary Duppasaha Anagara and Vishnu Shri Sadhvi will be without any assistance, how will they be worshippers? O Gautama! In the last time of the Dushama-kala, they will be endowed with Kshaayopashamika Samyaktva, Jnana, Darshana, and Charitra. Among them, the great-souled, great-virtuous Duppasaha Anagara, whose Darshana, Jnana, and Charitra are extremely pure, who has well seen the path of good destiny, will be like the spotless moon in the cloudless, clear sky, venerable even among the venerable, most worshippable even among the worshippable.
And that Sadhvi Vishnu Shri will be like a flag of Samyaktva, Jnana, and Charitra, great-souled, great-virtuous, great-noble, endowed with such qualities that one can easily remember her name. And then there will be a couple of Shravaka-Shravika named Jinadata and Phalguśri, whose virtues will be such that they can be described for many days. Their lifespan will be more than sixteen years. After observing the eight-year Charitra-paryaya, then after repenting for the sins, becoming free from bondage, and being devoted to the remembrance of Namaskara, by observing the Upavasa-bhakta-bhojana-pratyakhyana, they will attain Saudharma-kalpa. Then they will come to the lower human world. Even then, they will not violate the order of the Gaccha. Sutra-812-813
O Bhagavan! Why is it said so, that even then there will be no violation of the Gaccha system? O Gautama! Here, in the near future, there will be great ascetics named Shayambhava, who will possess great fame, great virtue, great nobility, and great intellect, and will hold the knowledge of the twelve Angas like a mountain. They, being impartial, will, through the excellence of knowledge, extract the essence of the Dasavaikālika Shruta-skandha, which is similar to the supreme essence and cream, for the benefit of the short-lived, virtuous beings. O Bhagavan! For whose sake? O Gautama! For the sake of Manak. Considering that this lineage of Manak, which is like a vast and terrible ocean of suffering, how can it cross this ocean-like Samsara of four Gatis? This is not possible without the teaching of the Omniscient. The teaching of this Omniscient is such that it enables crossing beyond and frees from suffering. It is endowed with infinite gati-paryayas. In a short time, one does not attain the immersion in all the scriptures taught by this Omniscient. Therefore, O Gautama! The highly knowledgeable Shayambhava will contemplate that the ocean of knowledge has no end, the time is short, and there are many obstacles, so they will grasp what is essential, just as the swan extracts sweet water from saline water.
Sutra-814
They have extracted the Dasavaikālika Shruta-skandha from the great scriptures, knowing that this virtuous soul, Manak, may gain the knowledge of the principles. At the time when the twelve Angas and their meanings will be divided, the Duppasaha Anagaras until the end of the Dushama-kala will study the Dasavaikālika Sutras and their meanings, studying the Dasavaikālika Shruta-skandha, which is like the essence of the entire Agama. O Gautama! These Duppasaha Anagaras will also follow the meaning of that Dasavaikālika, but they will not engage in any self-willed conduct.

**Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number**

At that time, the twelve Anga forms of the Śruta Skandha will be established in the Śruta Skandha. O Gautama! For this reason, it is said that you should not violate the rules of the Gaccha's organization, however simple it may seem.

**Sūtra - 815**

O Bhagavant! If a very pure and accomplished Ganaka has a disciple who is very wicked and disobeys his orders out of arrogance, or because of his caste, etc., is he an Ārādhaka? A Ganī who is impartial towards enemies and friends, who embodies the qualities of a Guru, and who always conducts himself with pure intentions according to the Sūtras, has four hundred and ninety-nine disciples who disobey his orders. They are Ānārādhakas, just as the four hundred and ninety-nine disciples who disobeyed the orders of the Ārādhaka are Ānārādhakas.

**Sūtra - 816**

O Bhagavant! Who were the five hundred disciples who did not become Ārādhakas by disobeying the orders of such a virtuous and great Guru? O Gautama! This was the Gaccha Adhipati named "Vaiir," who was born after the twenty-fourth Tirthankara attained Nirvana, during the time of the twenty-three previous Tirthankaras of Ṛṣabha Deva's twenty-four Tirthankaras. He was a great soul, a great being, and worthy of receiving the name in the morning. He had a Gaccha with five hundred disciples, without any Sādhvīs. If you count the Sādhvīs, there were two thousand.

O Gautama! Those Sādhvīs were very fearful of the afterlife. They had very pure hearts, were forgiving, humble, controlled their senses, were free from attachment, practiced very diligently, and had more affection for the six-sensed beings than for their own bodies. They were very brave and had practiced severe austerities and served the feet of the Tirthankaras, as described in the scriptures by Bhagavant. They were free from delusion, pride, ego, attachment, desire, laughter, play, lust, and the desire to be worshipped, and they followed the Śramaṇya with a humble mind, like the way the Tirthankara Bhagavant had shown them.

O Gautama! Those Sādhus were not very attractive. O Gautama! One day, those Sādhus said to the Ācārya, "O Bhagavant! If you give us permission, we will go on a pilgrimage to pay our respects to the Dharmachakra of Chandra Prabhu Swami and then return." Then, O Gautama! The Ācārya, without any hesitation or haste, replied to them in a deep and sweet voice, "It is not appropriate for disciples to use such beautiful words like 'Suvihitō' to go on a pilgrimage." When they return, I will have you go on a pilgrimage and pay your respects to Chandra Prabhu Swami. Secondly, there is a tendency to be unrestrained while traveling. For this reason, pilgrimages are forbidden.

Then the disciples asked, "How do Sādhus become unrestrained when they go on pilgrimages?" Then, again, they called out a second time, "Icchakāreṇa," and answered with anger and agitation in front of many people. But, O Gautama! At that time, the Ācārya thought, "Even if I forbid them, they will surely go on the pilgrimage." For this reason, he spoke sweet words. After thinking about it for a long time, the Ācārya said, "Do you understand the meaning of the Sūtras easily? If you do, then you can understand the kind of unrestraint that occurs during pilgrimages. What is the point of saying more about this? Secondly, you have recognized the nature of the world, the essence of living beings, and everything else as it should be. Now, I have explained many things to you. Even if I stop you from going on the pilgrimage, they will leave, filled with anger like Yama, and go on the pilgrimage, abandoning the Ācārya."

As they went, they committed the fault of seeking food in the wrong way, they came into contact with green plants, they chewed seeds, they committed the fault of unrestraint due to the suffering, torment, and disturbance caused by ants and other disabled beings, and they did not perform Pratikramaṇa while sitting. They did not follow the proper procedures for both large and small vessels and other equipment.

Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'
They could not observe the study/purpose/Sutra number cleaning. While doing Padilehan, they dried the clothes of the air-bodied being, how much to say? O Gautam! How much to describe it?
Eighteen thousand Sheelang, seventeen types of restraint external and internal twelve types of tapas, forgiveness, etc. and non-violence characteristics-filled ten types of Shraman Dharma, they have made the two limbs of the great Shrautasthaskandha stable-familiar by reading and remembering each and every step of the beginning many times for a long time. They have learned by doing many Bhangas and hundreds of Jodan sorrows, they have followed the Niratichar Charitradharma. All this, as it has been said, they followed with Ni. Hearing all this, the Gachchadhipati thought that, in my indirectness, in my absence, that wicked-minded disciple will consume excessive unrestraint due to ignorance, they will seem to me to be all unrestrained, because I am their Guru. Therefore, I will go after them and inspire them so that I do not become liable for atonement in this matter of unrestraint. Making such a choice, the Acharya went after them, and in the meantime, he saw them going even more unrestrained and badly in violation of the law. Then, O Gautam! With the beautiful, sweet words of the Alaap, the Gachchadhipati said - Oh, excellent lineage
and pure lineage ornaments like some great beings! You have found the wrong path, the five great vows have been accepted, the great fortunate beings with bodies, the omniscient Bhagvant has made a model for twenty-seven thousand Sthandeel places. The one who uses the Shruti should examine its purity, but should not become a user in others. So why are you walking with a zero-zero mind, with non-use? Use it in it with your desire.
Secondly, have you forgotten this Sutra and its meaning? This Sutra is of the most essential kind of all the ultimate principles. If a sadhu himself hits a two-sense animal with his hand or foot or with others or with a stick etc. instrument, causes it to be hit or considers the one who hits it to be right, the karma bound by it when it arises, then just as the flour is ground in the machine, the karma is destroyed, if the karma is bound by deep consequences, then the sinful karma is suffered for twelve years, then that karma is consumed, if it is deeply afflicted, then for ten thousand years, if it is deeply nailed, then after ten lakh years that sinful karma is consumed and it causes trouble, that is, it gives all the sorrows except death. By doing so, they can consume sinful karma by suffering for crores of years. Understand the same way about the three-sense being. You can understand this much, so don't be afraid.
O Gautam! In the same way, even after the Acharya's Sarana, the great sinners, in the restlessness of walking, all of them become hasty together, they do not respect the Acharya's word, which is such that it liberates from the sorrows of the eight karmas. Then, O Gautam! The Acharya understood that surely this disciple is traveling on the wrong path, he is a sinner of all kinds and my wicked disciple, so why should I follow him now by speaking flattering words? This is like flowing in the flow of a dry, happy river. Even if all these go through the ten doors, I will now practice for the benefit of my soul. Secondly, will my little bit be protected by the group of great merits that I have done? This is the order of the Tirthankar Bhagvant. Sutra-817
Or do this self-benefit and if possible, definitely do the benefit of others. If there is time to do both self-benefit and benefit of others, then self-benefit should be practiced first. Sutra-818
Secondly, this disciple may perform the action of tapas and restraint, then it will be for his own benefit, and if he does not, then he will have to go to the unreturned hell. Still, I have been given the Gachcha, I am the Gachchadhipati

Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'
I am a student/purpose/Sutra number, I should show them the right path. And then the other thing to keep in mind is - Tirthankar Bhagvant has told the thirty-six qualities of an Acharya, I will not violate even one of them. Maybe my life will also go away by doing so, even then I will become a devotee. Agam says that it is not against this world or the next world, not to do it, not to make it happen or not to consider the one who does it good, then they do not even do what the virtuous Tirthankar says, then I will take their guise. The scripture has been described in this way that whoever is a sadhu or sadhvi, even if he behaves falsely only by words, then he should be corrected by Sarna, Varana, Choyana, Prati Choyana, even after doing Sarana, Varana, Choyana, Parichoyana, whoever is lazy by rejecting the words of the elders, according to the saying, does not back down from such misdeeds, he should be taken out by taking his guise. In that way, according to the justice described in Agam, O Gautam! That Acharya took the guise of one disciple. In the meantime, the rest of the disciples ran in every direction.
After that, O Gautam! That Acharya slowly started going after them, but he didn't go fast. O Gautam! If you go fast, you will have to transition from salty land to sweet land. You will have to walk from sweet land to salty land. From black land to yellow land, from yellow land to black land, from water to land, from land to water, you will have to transition, so you should transition by ritually cleaning your feet. If you don't clean your feet, you will get twelve years of penance. Therefore, O Gautam! That Acharya is not walking in a hurry.
Now, at some point, they were transitioning from one place to another according to the method described in the Sutra, then O Gautam! A Kesari Singh, who was weak in body due to hunger for many days, appeared in front of that Acharya, with a terrible Yama Raja like appearance with a visible beard, frightening like the time of destruction. The great Gachhadhipati thought that if I walk fast and in a hurry, I can escape from the claws of this lion, but it is better to be destroyed, but it is not good to act in indiscipline. Thinking this way, he gave back the guise of the disciple whose guise he had taken, and that Gachhadhipati, who had a body of renunciation, stood there, adopting the vow of fasting. That disciple also stayed accordingly. Now, at that time, O Gautam! The lion killed both of them, remembering the five auspicious things with a very pure inner mind, with the yoga of auspicious determination. Therefore, both of them became Antakrit Kevali. They became Siddhas, free from eight kinds of karma-mal-kalank. Now, those 499 sadhus, who were experiencing the suffering of that karma-dosha and will experience it again, and will wander in the endless ocean of the world, who is capable of telling the whole story even from time? O Gautam! Those 499 or those who did not worship by violating the command of the virtuous great Guru, they became eternal worldly beings. Sutra - 819
O Bhagvant! Should one not violate the command of the Tirthankar or the command of the Acharya? O Gautam! Acharya has been told of four types. They are as follows - Naam Acharya, Sthapana Acharya, Dravya Acharya and Bhava Acharya. Among them, those who are Bhava Acharya should be considered equal to Tirthankar. Their command should not be violated.
Sutra-820
O Bhagvant! When will they be called Bhava Acharya? O Gautam! Those who have been initiated today, but still behave by following the position according to the Agam method, they are called Bhava Acharya. Those who, even after being initiated for a hundred years, hinder the Agam even by words, should be employed in Naam and Sthapana Acharya.
O Bhagvant! How much penance does an Acharya get? The penance that a sadhu gets, that penance

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Mahānishīth'

**Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number** The Ācārya or the leader of the Gaccha, the Pravartani, receives seventeen times the merit. If there is a violation of conduct, then three lakh times. Because it is very difficult, but not easy. Therefore, the Ācārya and the leader of the Gaccha should carefully protect their Paccakkāna. They should become one with unblemished conduct.

**O Bhagvant!** If a Guru, due to some reason, makes a mistake in a place like that, is he considered an Ārādhaka or not? **O Gautam!** A Guru who possesses great qualities, has unblemished conduct, is diligent, free from laziness, completely free from all attachments, has equal feelings towards enemies and friends, is a supporter of the right path, gives Dharma-upadesha, is righteous, should not become blood-stained by becoming a preacher of the wrong path and becoming arrogant. In every way, the Guru should be diligent, but not negligent. If someone becomes negligent, then understand that he is of very bad future and has ugly characteristics. Not only that, but understand that he is a great sinner, unworthy of being seen.

If he has the seed of Samyaktva, then he should tell himself, his disciples, or others in the disciple community, in the same way that he has become of bad character, "I am truly a Darant Pant, unworthy of being seen, a doer of great sins. I am destroying the Samyag path." By blaming himself, by humbling himself before the Guru, by criticizing himself, by taking Prāyaścitta as stated in the scriptures, he may become an Ārādhaka. If he is free from malice, free from deceit and illusion, then such a soul does not deviate from the right path. Perhaps if he is corrupted from the right path, then he is not an Ārādhaka.

**Sūtra - 821**

**O Bhagvant!** What kind of qualities should a Guru possess so that we can deposit the Gaccha with him? **O Gautam!** One who has good vows, beautiful conduct, firm vows, firm character, joyful bodily parts, is worthy of worship, free from attachment, free from hatred, whose stains of great Mithyātva have gone, who is calm, who knows the state of the world well, who is deeply immersed in great renunciation, who is against women's stories, who is against food-related stories, who is against stories about thieves, who is very compassionate, who is afraid of doing sinful deeds that harm the afterlife, who is against Kusīla, who knows the secrets of the scriptures, who is insightful in the scriptures he has accepted, who is always engaged in the ten types of Śramaṇa Dharma, such as forgiveness and non-violence, who is engaged in the twelve types of Tapas, who is always engaged in the five Samitis and three Guptis, who performs the worship of eighteen thousand Śīlāṅgas according to his ability, who does not violate the seventeen types of restraint, who is interested in the path of liberation, who is interested in the truth, who has equal feelings towards both enemies and friends, who is free from the seven types of fear, such as fear of this world and the afterlife, who has completely abandoned the eight types of pride, who is free from fear of violating the nine types of Brahmacharya Guptis, who is a holder of vast knowledge, who is born in an Ārya family, who is never humble in any situation, who is not angry, who is not lazy, who is diligent, who is opposed to the coming and going of the restrained class, who is a constant giver of Dharma-upadesha, who is a model of constant Oga Samachārī, who lives within the limits of Sadhutva, who is free from the fear of Asamachārī, who is capable of giving Prāyaścitta and charity that is worthy of criticism, who knows the violation of the seven Mandalīs, such as Vandanadi, who knows the purpose and the purpose of the violation of the great initiation, establishment, yoga, etc., actions.

One who knows the time, the field, the substance, the feeling, and other feelings, who is free from the causes of time, etc., who is skilled in guiding children, elders, the sick, and newly initiated ones in restraint, who models the groups of knowledge, vision, and character, who protects and upholds them, who is influential, who has firm Samyaktva, who is free from sorrow, who is patient, who is serious, who has excessive gentleness, who does not seek anything from anyone, who is completely free from the six types of living beings, who is afraid of obstructing Dharma, who is afraid of all desires, who has the pride of Siddhi, etc.

**Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number**

Free from Roudra and Ārtadhyāna, who is diligent in performing all necessary actions and especially endowed with Labdhi.

**Who, even in an unexpected situation, even if someone inspires or invites, does not engage in improper conduct, does not sleep excessively or eat excessively, is a conqueror of all necessary things, svādhyāya, dhyāna, pratimā, abhigraha, ghora pariṣaha-upasarga, is a collector of excellent vessels, knows the method of correcting apajñā, has an unbroken body, knows paramat and svamat, is completely free from kṣaya like anger, ego, possessiveness, play, kandarpa, etc., tells dharmakatha, generates vairāgya in worldly desires, etc., awakens the bhavyātmā, and is capable of establishing the burden of the -gaccha, is the master of two ganas.**

**He is the holder of the gana, the form of the tīrtha, the performer of the tīrtha, the arhant, the kevali, the jin, the influencer of the tīrtha, the venerable, the worshipable, the worthy of salutation (worthy of being saluted). He is worthy of being seen. He is supremely pure, supremely auspicious, he is supremely auspicious, he is the cause of siddhi, he is liberation, he is mokṣa. He is Śiva. He is the protector, he is siddha, he is liberated, he has crossed over, he is deva, he is the deva of devas. O Gautama! Such a person, to establish a gana for him, to have it established, and to approve of the deposit, otherwise, O Gautama! It is a violation of the command. Sūtra-822**

**O Bhagavan! For how long is this command to be enforced? O Gautama! As long as there are mahāyāśavāla, mahāsattvavāla, mahāguṇabhāga, Śrī Prabhunāma aṇagāra, the command will be enforced. O Bhagavan! After how long will there be Śrī Prabhunāma aṇagāra? O Gautama! There will be a Kalki king who is not worthy of being seen, who is cruel, angry, fierce, harsh, violent, punishing, without restraint, merciless, cruel, a great sinner, a sinner, a wicked, false-sighted, non-Aryan. That king will cause harm and trouble to the 'Śrī Śramaṇa Saṅgha' who wish to go on alms rounds. Then, O Gautama! There will be some virtuous, steadfast, ascetic aṇagāra who will be there. They will be accompanied by the Sāudharma Indra Mahārāja, who rides on the elephant Airāvata, with a vajra in his hand. **

**In the same way, O Gautama! The Śrī Śramaṇa Saṅgha, who have seen the evidence with their own eyes, who have been saluted by Devendra, are ready to give up their lives. But they are not ready for hypocrisy. O Gautama! Those who have no support from each other, who have the characteristic of ahiṃsā, who have the tenfold dharma of kṣamā, etc., who are alone, the Devādhideva Arihant Bhagavan, one jinalaya, one venerable, worshipable, worthy of respect, worthy of honor, mahāyāśa-mahāsattvavāla, mahānu bhāga, who are such, firm in their vows, vows, rules, who are tapas-dhan sadhu. Those sadhus were like the moon, gentle and cool, with a soft glow, like the sun, with a bright glow of tapas, like the earth, capable of enduring pariṣaha-upasarga, like Mount Meru, unshakable, with the characteristics of ahiṃsā, etc., with the tenfold dharma of kṣamā, etc., the muni-vara were surrounded by a good community of śramaṇa, like a clear sky without clouds, in which the pure moon of the Śarad Pūrṇimā is surrounded by many stars and planets, like the planet Chandra, which shines brightly, so these Śrī Prabhunāma aṇagāra gana community shone brightly. O Gautama! Śrī Prabhu aṇagāra enforced this command for so long. Sūtra-823-824**

**O Bhagavan! What happened after that time? O Gautama! In the time after that, any soul who abandons the beginning of the six kāya jīva is considered to be blessed, worthy of worship, venerable, worthy of salutation, and living a beautiful life. O Bhagavan! In general, what is to be said in this way? O Gautama! What kind of soul is appropriate from the point of view of expectation? And (for pravrajyā) there is no one appropriate. O Bhagavan! Why do you say so? O Gautama! Because of those who are prohibited and those who are not prohibited, it is said that one**

Study/Purpose/Sutra Number is appropriate and one is not appropriate. So, O Bhagvant! How many are there who are generally prohibited and who are not prohibited? O Gautam! There is one who is against and one who is not against. The one who is against is prohibited, and the one who is not against is not prohibited. O Bhagvant! Who is against and who is not?

O Gautam! The one who is worthy of being condemned in that country, in which countries he is condemned, in which country he is prohibited, he is against in that country. The one who is not condemnable in any country, he is not prohibited in that country, he is not against in that country. O Gautam! There, in which countries he is considered against, do not give him pravrajya. Whoever is not considered against in which country, they should be given pravrajya.

O Bhagvant! In which country is who against and who is not considered against? O Gautam! If any man or woman kills or causes to be killed, troubles or causes trouble, a Shraman, a Shravak, a mother, a father, a brother, a sister, a nephew, a son, a grandson, a daughter, a niece, a daughter-in-law, a son-in-law, a wife, a partner, a gotra, a caste, a non-caste, a relative, a poor person, a native, a foreigner, an Arya, a Mlechchha, out of attachment or hatred, repentance, anger, greed, then he is unfit for pravrajya. He is a sinner, condemned, blameworthy, worthy of being condemned. He is prohibited from initiation. He is an obstacle, a hindrance, a bringer of disgrace, a bringer of ill-repute, he has found the wrong path, he is immoral, even in the state he is wicked, similarly defeated by some other vice, he is very complex, very hungry, he is a thief, his caste, family, character and nature are unknown, he has a body afflicted with many diseases and pains, and he is greedy for taste, he is a great sleeper, he is a storyteller, he is a laughter, a play, a lust, a non-believer, a master, a commander, and he is very arrogant, he is of a very low class or a low caste, he is born in a womb against the truth or against the rule, if any Acharya, Gachchhanayak, Geetarth or Ageetarth, who is endowed with the qualities of an Acharya or who is endowed with the qualities of a Gachchhanayak, who is going to be an Acharya or who is going to be a Gachchhanayak, gives pravrajya to that (disciple) out of greed or pride even within two hundred yojanas, then O Gautam! He is a violator of the rules of preaching, a breaker of preaching, a breaker of pilgrimage, a breaker of the Sangha.

And then he is equal to the one who is defeated by vice, he does not see the loss of the afterlife, he is a promoter of immorality, he is a doer of evil. He is a sinner, a great sinner, a great sinner among the great sinners. O Gautam! Indeed, consider him to be a hypocrite, a demon, a fierce, a cruel, a false-sighted.

**Sutra-825**

O Bhagvant! Why is it said so? O Gautam! There is the path of liberation in conduct, but there is no path of liberation in misconduct. Why is it said so? O Bhagvant! What are the conducts and what are the misconducts? O Gautam! To behave according to the command of the Lord is conduct, to behave against his command is called misconduct. In it, whatever is against the command is to be completely avoided in solitude. And then, whatever is not against the command is completely worthy of being practiced in solitude. And O Gautam! If anyone is found who will contradict this Shramanapan, then completely abandon him.

**Sutra-826**

O Bhagvant! How to test him? O Gautam! Whoever is a man or woman who desires to embrace Shramanapan (from the hardship of this initiation) trembles or shakes, sits down, vomits, desires his own or others' community, speaks of non-belief, makes a relationship, starts walking towards him or observes him, see in front of them

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

Study/Purpose/Sutra Number, be ready to pull the robe, if there is an inauspicious occurrence or a bad omen, then the Gītartha Acharya, Gachchādhipati or any other leader should explain with great skill that such and such an omen, for which it is not possible to give Pravrajyā. If perhaps Pravrajyā is given, then it becomes a great opposite conduct - against. It completely corrupts the Dharma and character. They should be considered to be eager to do inaction in solitude in all ways. No matter how he boasts of Shruta or knowledge, he changes his form in many ways. Sutra-827-830

O Bhagvant! Who is called a Bahurupi? One who has a lax character, such a person who is eager to be a playful wanderer, pretending to be a person of strict conduct, or one who is devoid of Dharma or has a corrupt character, who assumes various forms in the land of drama, like a Charan or a drama, one moment Ram, one moment Lakshman, one moment a ten-headed Ravana, and then terrible ears, protruding teeth, an aged body, dull and faded eyes, a very elaborate jester, such a person who changes his form, one moment a monkey, Hanuman or Kesari Singh of the animal species. Such a Bahurupi, a jester, one who does such Bahurupi, O Gautam! If perhaps, due to a slip, someone who is not worthy has been given initiation, then keep him far away on the path, in between. Do not walk with him closely. Do not talk to him with respect. Do not give him any articles or equipment, do not make him study the scriptures, do not give him permission, do not discuss secret matters with him.

O Gautam! Give Pravrajyā to one who is free from the mentioned faults. And then, O Gautam! Do not give initiation to an Anarya born in a Mlechchha country. Do not give initiation to a son of a prostitute, and then do not give initiation to a Ganika, and to one who is blind, one who has lost his hands and feet, one who is mutilated, one who has pierced ears and nose, one who has leprosy, one who has pus oozing from his body, one who has a rotten body, one who is lame in his feet, one who cannot walk, one who is dumb, one who is deaf, one who has intense Kashaya,

And to one who associates with many hypocrites, one who is attached to strong raga-dvesha, moha, mithyatva, one who abandons his son, one who has suffered the consequences of old and hollow gurus and Jinālaya, many Dev-Devi's Sthanak, one who is a potter, and a Nat, a dramatic artist, a wrestler, a Charan, one who is dull in reading Shruta, one whose feet and hands do not work, one who has a large body, do not give him Pravrajyā.

Do not give Pravrajyā to one who is nameless, weak, casteless, condemned, of a low family, foolish, ignorant, of other types of low caste, whose family and nature are known. This rule or any other rule, if there is a slip, if there is haste, then the purification of that fault will take place in the previous crore years of the country, or it may not. Sutra-831-832

As it is done in the scriptures, by following the true system of the Gachchha, the infinite soul, freed from the dirt and torment of karma-rupa-raj, has attained the path of liberation. Dev, Asura and the humans of the world, bowing down to them, whose unparalleled fame is sung in this world, as the Kevali Tirthankara Bhagvant has said, those who remain in the Gan, those who strive for self-power, the Gachchādhipati attain and will attain great liberation.

Sutra-833

O Bhagvant! Whoever is unaware of the good qualities of the scriptures, whether by law or by lawlessness, in any Gachchha's conduct or in the principles of the Mandalī Dharma, or in the thirty-six types of knowledge, darshan, charitra, tapas and virya, in any way, in any way, in any place of conduct, in the heart of any Gachchādhipati or Acharya, even after the pure results have been obtained, repeatedly fails, slips, or acts in a way that is not in accordance with the rules, then he is...

Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'
Study/Purpose/Sutra Number: Is a worshiper or non-worshiper counted?
Gautam: He is considered a non-worshiper.
Bhagvant: For what reason is this said?
Gautam: He who is the form of the twelve Angas, Shruta Jnana, a great proof, and endless. Whose beginning is not or destruction is not, the one who has achieved the wonderful thing, has been well-established from the beginning. Even Devendra is worthy of worship, such unparalleled strength, vigor, extraordinary character, valor, great heroism, radiance, brilliance, beauty, form, good fortune, a group of great arts, adorned with prosperity, infinite knower, self-realized, Jinavar, and infinite, beginningless, Siddha, present time, becoming Siddha, in the next near time, achieving Siddha, such infinite ones whose names are worthy of being taken in the morning, great beings, great souls, a tilak in the three worlds, the best in the world, a brother of the world, a guru of the world, omniscient, knowing everything, seeing everything, the best, the best, the propagator of Dharma Tirtha, Arihant Bhagvant, past, future, beginningless, present, all encompassing, all qualities, all things, the one who has recognized the harmony of everything, not taking help from anyone, the best, alone, whose path is one, such Tirthankar Bhagvant, he has described it from the Sutra, from the meaning, from the scripture, in its true form, he has followed it as it is. Worthy of being said, worthy of being recited, worthy of being described, worthy of being spoken, worthy of being stated, such are these twelve Angas and their meaning, the Ganipitaka.
Those twelve Angas and their meaning, Tirthankar Bhagvant, who is even worthy of worship by Devendra, the knower of all the substances and all the categories of the entire world, including motion, stillness, history, intellect, jiva, etc., the nature of things. They are also inviolable. They are not to be transgressed, they are not to be desired. And then this twelve Anga form of Shruta Jnana is beneficial to all the beings, souls, ghosts, and beings of the entire world in solitude, it is capable of destroying karma, it is the cause of liberation, i.e., moksha. They are the ones who follow along with the births and deaths. They are the ones who show the way out of the world. It is well-established, full of great meaning, it is full of great qualities, it is very influential, because of the results being stated in it. The great sage, Tirthankar Bhagvant, has preached it.
Which is capable of destroying the twelve Angas, the suffering, for the destruction of karma like Jnanaavaran, for the liberation from the bondage of attachment, hatred, etc., for crossing over the ocean of the world. Being so, I will wander by accepting the twelve Angas. I have no other purpose. Therefore, whoever has not recognized the true nature of the scriptures, or has known the essence of the scriptures, the Gachcha-Dhipati or Acharya, whose results are pure from within, even then, he has missed the essence of the Gachcha's conduct, the Dharma of the Mandal, the thirty-six types of knowledge, etc., the conduct, the necessary things to be done, or the preaching, he has found a slip, or he has preached or acted in a contrary way, even a word or a letter within this twelve Anga form of Shruta Jnana, consider him to be showing the wrong path. He who shows the wrong path, he becomes a non-worshiper, for this reason it is said that he is a non-worshiper in solitude.
Sutra - 834
Bhagvant: Will there be anyone (soul) who will transgress, exceed, violate, break, contradict, desire, transgress with mind, speech, or body, etc., this supreme guru, the inviolable, supreme refuge, the manifest, the very manifest, the supreme welfare form, the one who ends all eight karmas and suffering, the preaching, the twelve Anga form of Shruta Jnana, and become a non-worshiper?
Gautam: Infinite time passes, now there will be ten good eras. In that time, countless Abhyavyo, countless Mithyadrishti, countless desirers, living in the substance-form, will freely honor themselves according to their own mind and imagination, they will desire honor, they will consider it to be religious, they will not understand that it is welfare, they will adopt the preaching of Jineswar, they will adopt it, they will suppress it with the greed for the taste of the tongue, with the greed for the object, with suffering.

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Mahānishīth'

**Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number** Such sensory defects always destroy the true path and spread the wrong path. At that time, they commit sins even to the extent of desiring the unbreakable discourse of the all-knowing Tirthankara.

**Sūtra - 835**
O Bhagvant! Which ten auspicious events will occur in the infinite time? O Gautam! At that time, these ten auspicious events will occur. They are as follows: 1. The Tirthankara Bhagvant being subjected to an attack, 2. The fetus being turned around, 3. A female Tirthankara, 4. The assembly of the community of those who are not worthy, who do not take initiation, gathering in the Tirthankara's discourse, 5. The arrival of the moon and the sun along with their vehicles in the Tirthankara's Samavasarana, 6. Krishna Vasudeva going to Aparakanka to bring back Draupadi, when the sound of the conch shell caused the Vasudevas to meet each other out of curiosity, 7. The origin of the Harivaṃśa lineage in this Bharatakṣetra, 8. The shedding of hair, 9. The attainment of Siddhi by 108 excellent-bodied beings at one time, 10. The worship and respect of the unrestrained.

**Sūtra - 836**
O Bhagvant! If someone, due to some kind of negligence, desires the Jain teachings, can they attain the position of an Ācārya? O Gautam! Whoever, due to some kind of negligence, repeatedly desires, violates, or approves of any other place of discourse, or engages in misconduct, or approves of misconduct, or desires the discourse, due to anger, pride, deceit, greed, attachment, aversion, fear, laughter, delusion, or an unknown defect, will not even attain enlightenment, let alone the position of an Ācārya. O Bhagvant! Can an unworthy or a false-sighted person attain the position of an Ācārya? O Gautam! They can, as the example of Angārapuruṣaka etc. shows. O Bhagvant! Can a false-sighted person be established in that position? O Gautam! They can be established.

O Bhagvant! This is certainly a false-sighted person. How can they be identified by what sign? O Gautam! Whoever, for the sake of being free from all attachments, utters all the Samayikas, and consumes food and water with a conscious mind and breath, embraces the Āṇagāra Dharma, and repeatedly consumes or causes others to consume liquor or intoxicating substances, or approves of those who consume them, or refutes any of the nine hidden practices of celibacy taught by a monk or nun, refutes them in mind, speech, or body, or causes others to refute them, or approves of someone else refuting or opposing them, is a false-sighted person. Not only a false-sighted person, but also an Ābhigrāhika false-sighted person.

**Sūtra - 837**
O Bhagvant! If any Ācārya or Gaççanāyaka, due to some kind of reason, repeatedly misrepresents this Nirgrantha discourse in a different way, what kind of fruit will they receive from such an action? O Gautam! They will receive the same kind of bad fruit that the Savadhācārya received. O Gautam! Who was that Savadhācārya? What bad fruit did he receive? O Gautam! In a previous twenty-four, before the twenty-four Tirthankaras of the present infinite time, there was a Dharma Tirthankara who had a body of seven hands in length. In his Tirtha, there were seven wonders. Now, at some point, that Tirthankara Bhagvant attained Nirvana. Then, in due course, recognizing the group of devotees, a scholar of the scriptures, with three kinds of pride, who was restless in liquor, and who was only an Ācārya and Gaççanāyaka in name, gathered wealth from the Śrāvakas, built a temple with a thousand pillars, high, with a sense of ego, in his own name, and lived in it, being a cruel, wicked person with the characteristics of a Duranta.

Despite having strength, power, courage, and determination, he concealed his courage, strength, and power, and abandoned the practice of unrestrained conduct, embracing the practice of daily life, in order to engage in fierce attachment.

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Mahānishīth'

The study/purpose/sūtra number had become lax.  From behind, abandoning the fear of loss in this world and the next, embracing the world for a long time, they, in the same monastery and temple, became excessively attached, with intellect, delusion, attachment, ego, etc., and after being defeated in the path of restraint, they began to strive to worship the gods (like householders) with various garlands of flowers, etc. And then they abandoned the word of the omniscient, which is the essence of the scriptures, the best, from a great distance. According to it, one should not kill all beings, all souls, all creatures, all entities, nor cause them pain. One should not give them distress, nor capture them, nor restrain them. One should not oppose them, nor insult them, nor harass them. Whether they are subtle, mobile, immobile, sufficient, insufficient, one-sensed, two-sensed, three-sensed, four-sensed, or five-sensed beings, one should not kill them, nor cause them to be killed, nor consider the killer to be good, nor approve of them. They forget even the vow of the great vow, which they themselves have not adopted. And then, O Gautama! The muni himself should completely abstain from sexual intercourse in solitude or with certainty and firmness, and from the initiation of water and fire. This kind of dharma is firm, eternal, and constant, as the omniscient Tirthankara Bhagavan, who knows the sorrow and suffering of people, has declared. Sūtra-838

O Bhagavan! What should be said to a sādhaka or sādhvi or a nirgrantha who commits dravyastava? O Gautama! Whoever commits dravyastava, whether a sādhaka or sādhvi or a nirgrantha, is called an unrestrained, improper, enjoyer of divine wealth, a worshiper of the gods, a promoter of the wrong path, one who abandons virtue from a distance, a deceitful, self-willed person. Sūtra-839

Similarly, O Gautama! Among many ācāryas and gacchanāyakas who were engaged in misconduct, there was a great ascetic nirgrantha named Kuvalayaprabha, who was like a shining emerald gem. He had a great deal of knowledge about the sūtras and the meaning of the scriptures concerning the great beings, etc. He was afraid of wandering in those wombs in this ocean of the world. At that time, despite the prevalence of such unrestraint and misconduct, and even after some sādharmikas continued to indulge in unrestraint and misconduct, that nirgrantha Kuvalayaprabha did not violate the command of the Tirthankara.

Now, at some point, he, who did not hide his strength, vigor, heroism, and prowess, along with his entire family of disciples, wandered around, preaching the beautiful dharma story that liberated many noble souls from the prison-like world, according to the omniscient, the Āgama Sūtra, its meaning, and both, free from attachment, aversion, delusion, false belief, sense of possession, and ego, with non-attachment to all things, in terms of substance, space, time, and state. He described their many virtues in this way, in special places like mines, cities, fields, heaps, pavilions, and droṇamukhas. His days passed in this way.

Now, one day, while wandering, he came to the place where he had always resided in one place. Recognizing him as a great ascetic, they honored him with appropriate humility, offering him worship, a seat, etc. He sat there comfortably. After entertaining them with dharma stories, etc., he tried to leave. Then, that great soul, Kuvalayaprabha, was addressed by a deceitful, wrong-sighted, greedy person who earned his livelihood by means of an evil, wicked, and corrupt character, who promoted the wrong path, saying, "O Bhagavan! If you decide to stay here for the rainy season, the Chaturmas, then, by your command, we will build as many Jina temples as you wish. Please stay here for the Chaturmas."

O Gautama! At that time, that great soul, Kuvalayaprabha, said, "Oh, speaker of sweet words! Even though it is a Jinalaya, it is still like sin. I will never approve of it, even with words." Thus, the scriptures...

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Mahānīśītha'

Having stated the essential, excellent essence of the study/purpose/sūtra number as it is, without any distortion, without any doubt, he, the hypocrite with the appearance of a sādhū, with a false view, earned the name and lineage of a Tīrthankara through the true representation. He dried up the ocean of the world, leaving only one birth remaining.

There was a gathering of the Sangha of the destined name, whose name was not taken. He, along with many others who were sinful and wore the appearance of sādhūs, gathered together and lamented the name of the great ascetic, the great soul, whose name was Kuvalayaprabha. Not only that, but they also clapped their hands together and established another name, 'Sāvadhācārya'. They began to call him by that name. That name became famous. O Gautama! Even though he was called by such an inappropriate word, even after speaking that name, he did not become angry. Sūtra - 840

Now, some time later, those who were wicked and turned away from good dharma, corrupted by both sādhū dharma and śrāvaka dharma, only wearing the appearance of a sādhū, claimed to have embraced the practice of renunciation. After some time, they began to think about the Āgama among themselves: "In the absence of śrāvakas, it is the sādhūs who are restrained who should take care of the temples, monasteries, and shelters. And if the Jina temples are broken or have fallen, they should have them repaired and renovated. If there is any beginning or commencement of such work, even if there are sādhūs present, they should not be blamed." And then some people say that restraint alone brings liberation. Some people say that it is the worship, respect, and offerings to the Jina shrines and Jina stupas that bring about the progress and influence of the Tīrtha and the Śāsana, and that is the means of liberation. Thus, those who did not understand the true ultimate reality, the sinners, spoke these words from their mouths, which seemed right to them.

At that time, a dispute arose between the two parties. There was no skilled man among them who was knowledgeable about the Āgama, who could think about what was right or wrong in this matter, or who could resolve the dispute with evidence. And one of them said that there were some Ācāryas who were knowledgeable about this subject, who lived in some place. The other then mentioned another name. As this dispute continued, one said, "What is the point of talking so much? Whatever decision Sāvadhācārya gives us in this matter will be authoritative." The other party on the opposite side also accepted this and said, "Call him quickly."

O Gautama! They called him, and he, constantly engaged in unattached conduct, arrived after seven months from a distant land. In the meantime, an Āryā saw him. Seeing Sāvadhācārya, whose body was emaciated by arduous, intense austerities and virtuous conduct, whose body was only skin and bones, whose body was extremely radiant with the intensity of his austerities, she was filled with wonder and began to think, "Is this great soul the Arhant, or is he embodied dharma?" What more could she think? Even the Devas are worthy of worship. His feet are worthy of my worship... Thinking this, with a heart full of devotion, she circumambulated him and saw that she was suddenly and spontaneously prostrating herself before Sāvadhācārya and touching his feet with her head. At one time, that Ācārya, in the way that the Jina Bhagavants, the teachers of the world, have taught, explained the sūtras and their meaning in order, as they are, according to the teachings of the guru. He was engaged in that virtuous activity.

One day, O Gautama! He said, "The eleven Angas, the fourteen Pūrvas, the twelve Anga-like Śruta-knowledge, the essence, the secret, the nectar, are the means of eliminating all sins and understanding the eight karmas. The fifth study of the Mahānīśītha Śruta-skandha explains them. O Gautama! In this study, as he was discussing, this verse came up. Sūtra - 841

"In the gaccha where such a cause arises, and where the hand of a woman touches the hand of a man, including the inner part of the garment, and even the Arhant himself touches it, that gaccha should be considered devoid of the mula-guna."

Study/Purpose/Sutra Number Sutra- 842

Then, with his doubts, he thought that if I were to present the true form here, then at that time, the Arya who was offering her respects had touched my feet with her head, and all this had been seen by the resident of this Chaitya. So, just as my name has become Savdhacharya, they will also give me another such disrespectful name, which will make me unworthy of worship in all the worlds. So now I will present the Sutra and its meaning in a different way. But doing so will be a great sin, so what should I do now? Should I present this verse or not? Should I present it in a different way? Or, oh dear, this is not right. Both ways are very reprehensible. It is not right to present it in a contradictory way, for the sake of self-interest. Because the intention of the scriptures is that the monk who repeatedly misses the twelve-fold Anga form of the Shruta-Vachan, who is negligent in obtaining Skhalana, who, out of fear of doubt, etc., presents even a single word, syllable, or vowel in a different way, who explains the Sutra and its meaning with doubt, who gives an inappropriate reading, that monk becomes eternally bound to Samsara. So what should I do here now? Whatever is to be, let it be. Thinking that I will tell the true meaning of the Sutra according to the Guru's teachings, O Gautam! I presented the true explanation of that verse, whose every part is pure. On this occasion, O Gautam! That Veshdhari, who was of the lowest character and belonged to the distant province, asked Savdhacharya, "If this is so, then you are also devoid of the root qualities. Because if you remember that day, then that Arya was eager to offer her respects, and while offering her respects, she touched your feet with her head. At that time, this Savdhacharya, who was afraid of the ill-repute of this world and was filled with excessive pride, was given a name. If such a name is given now, I will become unworthy of worship in all the worlds. So what solution should I give here now?" Thinking this, Savdhacharya remembered the words of the Tirthankara: "Whoever is the Gachchanaayak or Gachchadhipati of any Acharya, who is a bearer of Shruta, should know everything that the omniscient, infinite knower, Bhagavan, has forbidden in the place of sin and exception, and should act according to all the Shruta. Do not consider the one who acts well, do not approve of him, do not repeatedly miss or make a mistake due to anger, pride, Maya, greed, fear, laughter, arrogance, pride, or negligence, whether alone or in the presence of others, whether asleep or awake, whether with the mind, speech, or body, whether in the three ways or in the three ways, if there is any contradiction in even a single word of this Sutra or its meaning, that monk is repeatedly blameworthy, reprehensible, worthy of being scolded, worthy of being despised, defeated by all the worlds, with a body afflicted by many diseases and pains, wandering in the endless ocean of Samsara, which has ten excellent qualities, and cannot find even a moment of peace in that wandering. So, I, who am subject to negligence, a sinner, of the lowest, lowest, and inferior nature, a cowardly man, have been faced with a great calamity here, from which I am unable to give a reasonable solution. And in the afterlife, I will wander in the endless cycle of births and suffer terrible pain for countless times. Indeed, I am unfortunate. The wicked listener, who was a doer of evil deeds, recognized this Savdhacharya, who was thinking in this way, as a liar and a very proud person. Then, with a mind filled with anger, knowing him, that wicked listener said, "Do not take up the lecture until this doubt is dispelled. Therefore, give a solution to this, with a mature strategy that can remove stubbornness."

Then he thought, "Now they will not leave without getting a solution to this." So how should I give them a solution? Thinking this, again, O Gautam! That wicked person said to him, "Why are you drowning in this ocean of worry? Quickly give some solution to this matter. And then give such a solution that your strategy is unobjectionable, without any contradiction, in the stated faith." After that, Savdhacharya, feeling remorse in his heart for a long time, thought in his mind and said, "For this reason, the Jagadguru has said that..."

Agam Sutra 39, Cheda Sutra-5, 'Mahanisitha'
Study/Purpose/Sutra Number Sutra-843
Just as water placed in an unfit vessel destroys the water and the vessel, similarly, the sutras and their meanings given in an unfit vessel are destroyed. This principle is the secret that the insignificant basis is destroyed. Sutra - 844
Even then, that wicked person said, "Why do you indulge in such crooked and perverse speech without any proper relationship? If you are not capable of providing a proper solution, then get up, leave this seat, and leave quickly. Where the entire sangha has appointed you to expound the scriptures, considering you as an authority."
After that, even after a long time of repentance, O Gautama! Unable to find any other solution, the cautious acharya said that the Agam is endowed with the path of universal acceptance and exception. You do not know that the one-sided view is false belief. The command of the Jineshvara is of the nature of non-absolutism. O Gautama! Just as the new clouds of the rainy season soothe the peacock tormented by the heat of summer, in the same way, those discerning listeners accepted him with great respect. After that, O Gautama! Without even repenting for the sin of uttering a single word, that cautious acharya was born as a celestial being. From there, migrating, he was born in the womb of the daughter of the priest of Vasudeva, who was living in a foreign land. At some point, his mother, the wife of the priest, saw that her husband had gone abroad and her daughter had become pregnant, knowing this, she said, "Alas! My wicked daughter has defiled the entire family. The honor has been stained." Hearing this, the priest, after suffering great anguish for a long time, firmly decided in his heart and expelled her from the country, because this is a very serious defamation that cannot be remedied, I am very afraid of it.
After being expelled by the father, unable to find a place anywhere, after some time, troubled by the cold, heat, and wind, weakened by hunger, she entered into servitude in the house of a merchant dealing in ghee, oil, etc. There, they collect false liquor from the one who drinks a lot of liquor, and repeatedly eat false food. At some point, she was constantly eating false food and was seen drinking liquor and meat. Then she developed a strong desire to drink a lot of liquor. After that, low-caste people like actors, students, bards, diggers, servants, thieves, etc., who had properly renounced the head, tail, ears, bones, corpses, etc., started eating the light, false meat and drinking liquor. After that, she started eating the specially cooked meat in the earthen bowls placed in the navel. After some days, she became very greedy for liquor and meat.
In the merchant's house, she started stealing copper vessels, clothes, or other things and selling them elsewhere to buy liquor without meat. The merchant came to know this whole truth. The merchant complained to the king. The king ordered execution. Then in that kingdom, there is such a family tradition that if a pregnant woman becomes a criminal and is sentenced to death, but until she gives birth to the child, she is not killed. The executioners and the police, etc. took her to their house and started waiting for the time of delivery and started protecting her. At some time, the violent people of the Harikesh caste took her to their house.

In due course, the soul of Savdhacharya was born as a child. Immediately after giving birth, she abandoned the child and fled in terror of death. O Gautam! When she fled in one direction, the Chandala realized that the sinner had fled. The leader of the executioners pleaded with the king, "O Dev! The wicked woman has fled, abandoning the child as tender as the womb of a Kel. The king replied, "Let her go, but take good care of the child. Make every effort to ensure that the child does not die. Take these five thousand dravyas for his expenses." Then, by the king's order, the son of the Kulata was raised like a son. In due course, the wicked executioner died. Then the king made the child his heir. He made him the leader of five hundred Chandalas. While residing in the position of the leader of the butchers, he engaged in such unrighteous deeds and went to the seventh hellish earth called Apratisthan.

Thus, the soul of Savdhacharya, experiencing intense, fierce, wrathful, and terrifying suffering in the seventh hell, equivalent to thirty-three oceans, for a long time, emerged from there and was born in the Uruga caste in Antaradvip. From there, he died and was born as a fish in the Tiryanch Yoni. There too, he suffered for twenty-six years, enduring pain similar to the pain of hell, and then, O Gautam, he was born as a human. From there, the soul of Savdhacharya was born as Vasudev. There too, after fulfilling his due lifespan, he died due to the sins of Mahaparigraha, which he had accumulated through many battles, and went to the seventh hell. From there, after a long time, he was born in the human caste called Gajakarna. There too, due to the sin of meat-eating, he became cruel and determined, and died, again going to the seventh hell, Apratisthan. From there, he was born again as a fish in the Tiryanch Yoni. There, he suffered unbearable pain like hell and died. Then, he was born in the womb of the daughter of a widowed Kulata Brahmin.

Now, when the soul of Savdhacharya was in the womb of the Kulata, due to the sin of using caustic substances and medicinal concoctions to secretly abort the fetus, he was born with a body riddled with diseases and pain, decaying due to a malignant disease, covered in scabs, with a swarm of wriggling worms, eaten by insects, resembling hell, and dwelling in intense suffering. O Gautam! After that, he was condemned, despised, and hated by all beings, rejected by all worlds, deprived of food, drink, enjoyment, and consumption, and lived for seven years, two months, and four days, enduring extraordinary physical and mental suffering, and died, being born as a Vyantar Dev. From there, he became a human. Then, he became the leader of the executioners, and again, due to the sin of that deed, he went to the seventh hell. From there, he was born as a bull in the Tiryanch Yoni, belonging to a potter. From there, he became a human. Then, he became the leader of the executioners, and again, due to the sin of that deed, he went to the seventh hell.

From there, he was born as a bull in the Tiryanch Yoni, belonging to a potter. There, he was yoked to a mill, cart, plow, and arghatta, and his neck was rubbed against the grinding stone day and night, causing blisters and internal decay. Worms grew in his neck. Now, when his master, the potter, realized that he was no longer strong enough to bear the yoke on his shoulders, he started making him carry loads on his back. As time passed, his back also became rubbed and decayed, just like his shoulders. Worms grew in his back too. His entire back decayed, and the skin peeled off, revealing the flesh underneath. After that, he was considered useless because he could no longer work, and was abandoned. O Gautam! The soul of Savdhacharya was abandoned as a bull, eaten by wriggling worms. After that, he lived for twenty-nine years, with a decayed body, eaten by crows, dogs, and worms, both inside and out, and died, being born as a human, with a body riddled with diseases and pain, in the house of a very wealthy man. There too, he suffered from vomiting, bitter, pungent, astringent, and delicious tastes,

**Study/Purpose/Sutra Number**

Triphala, Guggul, and other medicines had to be consumed, constant cleansing was necessary, incurable, no relief, intense terrifying suffering, like being cooked in fire, enduring such difficult suffering, the human existence they had attained became unsuccessful.

In that way, O Gautam! The soul of Savdhacharya, after enduring the suffering of birth and death in the fourteen Rajalokas for an infinite time, was born as a human in the Avarvideha. There, due to the influence of the world, he received the awakening to go and pay homage to the Tirthankara Bhagvant, and after accepting initiation, he attained Siddhi in the time of the 23rd Tirthankara, Parshvanath.

O Gautam! Savdhacharya experienced such suffering. O Bhagvant! Such unbearable, intense, terrifying suffering befell him. He had to endure it. For such a long time, why did he have to endure all this suffering? O Gautam! At that time, he spoke as if saying, "The Agam has been explained, including Utsarg and Apavad. It is not explained in isolation, but through Anekanta. However, the consumption of Apkay, the commencement of Teukay, and sexual intercourse, these three are prohibited in any other place, in isolation, or with certainty, or firmly, or completely, for the sake of self-benefit. If this Sutra is violated here, the path of Samyag Marg is destroyed, the path of Unmarg flourishes, and due to the sin of disobedience, one becomes an Anantasansari."

O Bhagvant! Did Savdhacharya engage in sexual intercourse? O Gautam! He did and did not engage in sexual intercourse, meaning he did engage in sexual intercourse, but also did not. O Bhagvant! Why do you say it in two ways? O Gautam! The Arya, at that time, touched his head to his feet, and when he touched, he did not shrink back his feet. Because of this, O Gautam! It is said that he engaged in sexual intercourse, but also did not. O Bhagvant! Is there such a bound, touched, withdrawn karma bandha that can liberate one from such intense suffering just because of this reason? O Gautam! It is so. There is no difference. O Bhagvant! He had accumulated Tirthankara name karma. He had only one birth left, and he had crossed the ocean of births. Then why did he wander in the world for an infinite time? O Gautam! Because of the fault of his carelessness. Therefore, the Gachhadhipati, who has understood well the good nature of the scriptures that desire liberation from births, should remain completely and entirely free from carelessness in the place of restraint. Thus, I tell you.

Study/Purpose/Sūtrāṅka Study-6-Gītartha-vihāra Sūtra-845
O Bhagvant! He who reads, hears, explains, and constantly contemplates the Siddhānta Sūtra day and night, will he engage in immoral conduct? O Gautama! Even a single word known from the Siddhānta, he will not engage in immoral conduct until death. Sūtra-846
O Bhagvant! Then why did Nandiṣeṇa, who had the ten eastern Mahāprajñā, abandon his pravrajyā and enter the house of a gaṇikā? It is said, O Gautama! Sūtra-847-852
He experienced the consequences of his lapse in enjoyment. This truth is well-known. Yet, he trembled with fear of bhava. And after that, he quickly accepted dīkṣā. Even if Pātāla had an upward-facing mouth and heaven a downward-facing mouth, the words of a Kevali never change. Secondly, he took many measures to protect his saṃyama, thinking according to the śāstra, he went to a country where he would not be recognized, offering his linga-veśa at the lotus feet of his guru.
Remembering that vow, he experienced the consequences of his actions in the form of his character, the arising of mohaniya karma, the breaking of sarva, virati, mahāvrata, and the consequences of bound, touched, and removed karma. O Bhagvant! What measures did he think of, as described in the śāstra, that even today, he sustains his life, abandoning such a beautiful śramaṇapan? O Gautama! Will those who remember the Sūtra that describes the measures taken by a Kevali, or will those who are overcome by the object, remember this session? Sūtra-853-855
When the object arises, one should begin an eightfold austerity, which is very difficult and severe. If one is unable to control the object on any given night, it is better to fall from a mountain, sit on a bed of thorns, drink poison, or hang oneself, but not break the vow taken for mahāvrata or character. It is not appropriate to be unfaithful. If one is unable to perform these measures, one should offer one's veśa to the guru and go to a foreign country where news does not reach the familiar region, and observe aṇuvrata to the best of one's ability, so that one does not experience nirdhvaṃsātā in the future. Sūtra-856-864
O Gautama! When Nandiṣeṇa began to fall from the mountain, a voice was heard from the sky saying that he would not die even after falling from the mountain. As he looked towards the direction of the sound, he saw a Cāraṇa Muni. He said that he would not die prematurely. Then he went to eat the deadly poison. Even then, he could not bear the pain of the object, and he began to suffer greatly. Then he worried, "What is the purpose of my living now? I will truly be a sinner if I destroy the rule of this Lord, who is like a fragrant flower and a pure, radiant moon. Where will I go, an uncivilized person like me? Or is the moon marked with a blemish, and the fragrance of the jasmine flower fleeting, while the Jinaśāsana, free from the dirt and stain of the Kaliyuga, will last for a long time? If I slander this Jain preaching, which destroys all poverty, sorrow, and suffering, where will I go to purify my soul?" He went with sorrow, climbed a mountain with large rocks and a large quarry, and jumped, breaking his body into pieces, before he could easily destroy the rule while being subject to the object.
Then, he climbed the mountain with a pierced peak, and began to eat without storing food. Then,

Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'
Study/Purpose/Sutra Number Again in the sky, these words were heard - You will not die untimely. This is your final birth and body. Therefore, having enjoyed the fruits of your bound karma, accept restraint again. Sutra- 865-870
Thus, when the Charan Muni stopped him (from committing suicide) twice, he went to the lotus feet of the Guru, offered him his robes, and then pleaded - I had gone to a foreign land remembering the sutras and their meanings, and there I went to a prostitute's house to eat. When I preached Dharma, she demanded wealth from me. Then, because my attainment of that kind of wealth was certain, I said at that time, "Let it be so." At that time, I caused a rain of gold worth twelve and a half crore to fall from her temple and came out. The tall, large-breasted prostitute, with a firm embrace, said, "Oh, you little one! Why are you going back after giving this wealth unlawfully?" Nandiṣeṇa, thinking according to the occasion, said, "You give this wealth as you deem fit." Sutra- 871-874
At that time, he accepted that kind of vow and entered her temple. What vow did he accept? To enlighten ten people every day, and not to eat or drink until he had enlightened even one person and they had accepted initiation. Not to urinate or defecate until my vow is fulfilled. Second, not to initiate those who are ready to take vows. Because, as the Guru's conduct is, so is the disciple's. The prostitute, having arranged for the golden treasure not to be wasted, worshipped Nandiṣeṇa, who had a shaved head and a worn-out body, in such a way that he became bound by her love. Sutra- 875-877
From conversation, love arises, from love, desire, from desire, trust, from trust, affection - thus there are five kinds of love. In this way, even after being bound by the bonds of love, Nandiṣeṇa followed the teachings of the scriptures, maintained his lay life, and every day enlightened ten or more people and sent them to the Guru for initiation. Sutra- 878-881
Now, how did he receive enlightenment from the evil-minded Soni? He said to Nandiṣeṇa, "You preach Dharma to others, and you yourself are careless in your own spiritual work. Indeed, is this Dharma something to be sold? Because you yourself do not follow it." Hearing this wise saying of Durmukha, he trembled and began to condemn his soul for a long time. Alas, what have I done, I with a corrupt character? Like worms rotting in the filth of karma, I have rotted in the sleep of ignorance. I am cursed, I am cursed. Look at my improper conduct. I have made my noble soul, like pure gold, impure, like filth. Sutra- 882-884
Before this fleeting body of mine is destroyed, I will go to the lotus feet of the Tirthankara Bhagavan and atone for my sins. O Gautama! He will come here repenting like this and will receive the benefit of severe penance. By practicing severe and heroic austerities, he will consume his evil karma, ascend to the category of pure meditation, attain omniscience, and attain liberation. Sutra- 885
Therefore, O Gautama! From this example, think of many ways to maintain restraint according to the scriptures. Think of the ways in which Nandiṣeṇa offered his robes to the Guru, etc.

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Mahānishīth'
Study/Purpose/Sūtrāṅka Sūtra-886-889
Understand well the way in which utsarga is described in the सिद्धान्त. O Gautama! Despite doing tapas, he had the great rise of bhogavali karma. Even then, he experienced the arousal of the object. When he performed eightfold severe mahatapas, even then the rise of the object did not stop. Even then, he consumed poison. He performed bhṛgupāta from the mountain. He desired to do anashana. While doing so, the Cāraṇa Muni stopped him. After that, he went to an unknown land after offering rajohaṛana to his guru. O Gautama! Know this remedy described in the śruta. Sūtra-890-894
Just as one should not engage in any misconduct against the conduct until the rajohaṛana and pravrajyā are returned to the guru, so too, this veśa-rajohaṛana, taught by Jineśvara, should not be left in another place, leaving the guru. One should offer rajohaṛana to the guru with folded hands. If the guru mahārāja is capable and can understand him, then he should be explained and brought back to the right path. If someone else can understand him, then ask them to explain to him. If the guru has perhaps been pacified by the words of others, then one should not object. The one who is a bhavya, who has understood the advice, who recognizes the state of the world, O Gautama! The one who hates this position, just as the 'āsadane' wandered in the four gatis due to māyā, prapanca, and dambha, so too will he wander in the four gatis. Sūtra-895-900
O Bhagavant! Who was the āsad who was naturally inclined to māyā and prapanca? We do not know. Then, for what reason did he wander here, troubled by great sorrow? O Gautama! In the tīrtha of another, the last, tīrthankara, who was like a shining kāñcana, there was a disciple named āsad, who was the ācārya named Bhūtikṣa. Having accepted the mahāvrat, he studied the sūtra and the artha. At that time, the pain of the object did not arise, but he began to think curiously that the सिद्धान्त describes such a method. So, I will perform eightfold tapas, bhṛgupāta, anashana, eating poison, etc., all of which will please the guru class, so that they will also prevent me from becoming a deva and say that you have a long lifespan, you will not die. Enjoy your desires. Return the veśa-rajohaṛana to the guru mahārāja and go to another unknown land. After enjoying the fruits of your actions, practice severe vīra tapas. Sūtra- 901-905
Or, indeed, I am foolish. I am hurt by my own māyā-śalya. It is not considered appropriate for a śramaṇa to have such a thought in his mind. I will also make atonement for it later, lighten my soul, and accept the mahāvrat. Or, I will be called māyāvī again after making atonement. Then, for ten years, I will perform māsa-khaman and pāraṇa āyambil, for twenty years, I will perform continuous fasting for two months and pāraṇa āyambil, for twenty-five years, I will perform cāndrāyaṇa tapas. For eight years, I will perform chhathu, athūm, and four-four fasts, I will perform such severe atonement here of my own free will. I will perform this atonement here, staying at the lotus feet of the guru mahārāja. Sūtra - 906-909
Is this atonement not too much for me? Or, why would the tīrthankara Bhagavant have conceived this method? I am practicing it. And the one who has joined me in atonement, the all-knowing Bhagavant knows the truth, I will simply practice atonement. Whatever I have seen and thought here, may my sin be false. In this way, he performed severe atonement, which removes suffering, of his own accord, and by doing so, the one with the śalya died and became a vāṇavyantara deva. O Gautama! If he had made a proper atonement in front of the guru mahārāja and had practiced that much atonement, then he would have been born in the vimāna above the navagraiveyaka.

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Mahānīśītha'

**Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number Note:** In our Āgama Sūtra-39 Mahānīśītha, by mistake, 910 has been written instead of 1000 in the sequence. Sūtra-1000-1003

O Gautama! From the Vaṇamantra Deva, the one who fell, he came in the form of a donkey in the house of a king in the animal realm. There, due to the fault of always associating with horses, a disease arose in his testicles, and worms were born in them. O Gautama! The testicles were suffering from pain due to not getting food from being eaten by worms, and he licked the earth. At that time, a sage was returning from afar. Seeing that, he remembered his own caste. Remembering his past life, he began to blame and criticize his soul. And then he undertook fasting. Sūtra-1004-1010

O Gautama! The one who was eaten by crows and dogs, remembering the Arhant with pure devotion, gave up his body, obtained the time, and became a Sāmānika Deva named Mahāghosa of that Devendra. There, he enjoyed divine powers well and fell. From there, he was born as a prostitute. He did not reveal the deceit he had done, so from there, he died and wandered in many low, insignificant, and end-of-life families, and after a long time, he was born as the son of Shiva-Indra named Divyajan in the city of Mathura. He attained enlightenment, embraced the life of a Shraman, and attained Nirvana. O Gautama! I have told you the example of the deceitful one. Those who contradict in their minds the words spoken by any omniscient Bhagavant, not because of the pain of the objects, but also desire the objects out of curiosity. And then, without requesting their Guru, they perform atonement. They are the ones who wander in the cycle of births.

Therefore, one who knows should not teach the wrong path to even a single principle speaker. Sūtra-1011

If anyone recognizes the meaning of a word spoken by a Sarvaśruta or its meaning, and speaks it according to the path, then he does not bind sin. Believing this, one should not even mentally deviate from the right path. Thus, I tell you what I have heard from the mouth of Bhagavant. Sūtra-1012-1015

O Bhagavant! If someone performs atonement by taking excessive penance after doing a wrong deed, is it not better to not do the wrong deed in the first place? O Gautama! After doing a wrong deed, I will purify myself by performing atonement. In that way, it is not appropriate to even mentally hold on to those words. Consider anyone who believes in such words or acts according to them to be a carrier of all kinds of corruption. O Gautama! Perhaps even if he performs such a difficult atonement as if it were equal to the doubt of life, just as a butterfly enters the flame of a lamp and dies, so too, by breaking the command, one earns many deaths and worldly existence. Sūtra-1016-1019

O Bhagavant! What atonement will be given to a human who hides any strength, vigor, heroism, or prowess within himself and performs penance? O Gautama! Such a deceitful person may receive this atonement. Because knowing the strength of the enemy, even though he has his own strength, he has expected from him, the one who hides his strength, vigor, courage, and heroism, becomes a deceitful, wicked, and twice-atoned person. He suffers in the hellish state of the low caste, goes to the animal realm, and then wanders in the four realms. Sūtra-1020-1024

O Bhagavant! Can a great sin be consumed by performing penance? Because without experiencing the karma, it cannot be removed. So what is the benefit of performing atonement there? O Gautama! Sins accumulated over many crores of years...

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Chhedasūtra-5, 'Mahānishīth'

Just as snow and ice melt from the touch of the sun, so too does atonement melt away with the touch of the sun. Even in the darkest of nights, the darkness disappears with the rising of the sun. Similarly, atonement removes sins like darkness with the rising of the sun. However, one who performs atonement must ensure that they do not hide their strength, vigor, courage, and prowess, but instead, with a pure heart, they should remove the sin-burden. Otherwise, even if they perform atonement, they will wander in the four realms for a long time. (Sūtra - 1025-1027)

O Bhagvant! To whom should one confess? Who can give atonement? To whom can atonement be given? O Gautam! One can confess to a Kevali with a pure heart, even if they are a hundred yojanas away. In the absence of a Kevali, one can confess to a Chaturjñānī, and in their absence, to an Avadhijñānī, and in their absence, to a Śruta-jñānī, whose knowledge is most pure. (Sūtra - 1028-1030)

One should confess their sins, reveal them, and accept atonement from a Guru who is a guide on the path of renunciation, who travels on the path of renunciation, who has a taste for the path of renunciation, who conducts themselves with renunciation in all aspects, who is calm in nature, who controls their senses, who is disciplined, who is an ascetic, who is a firm follower of the principles of samiti-gupti, who is pure in heart. One should confess their sins to such a Guru, either by themselves or through others, and then always perform atonement according to the Guru's instructions. (Sūtra - 1031-1035)

O Bhagvant! What is the definite atonement for this? How many and what are the stages of atonement? Please tell me. O Gautam! A Śramaṇa with good conduct who commits a transgression receives atonement, while a disciplined sādhvī receives nine times more atonement. If the sādhvī violates her conduct, she receives nine times more atonement. This is because nine lakh living beings reside between her and the ordinary beings. Only a Kevali Bhagvant can see them. Only a Kevali can see these beings with their knowledge. An Avadhijñānī can see them, but a Manahparyavjñānī cannot. (Sūtra - 1036)

When a sādhvī or any woman or man engages in sexual intercourse, the living beings in her womb are churned like the grinding of flour in a mill, becoming intoxicated with lust. The five-sense beings in the womb are churned and reduced to ashes. (Sūtra - 1037-1041)

When a woman walks, these beings experience intense pain. When she urinates, two or three beings die, and the rest suffer. O Gautam! There are countless stages of atonement. If even one of them is neglected and the person dies with the sin-burden, then the sin they accumulate is greater than that of a cruel human who rips open the bellies of a hundred thousand women and removes their seven or eight-month-old fetuses. The pain of the writhing fetus is greater than the sin of the human who rips open the bellies. A sādhvī who engages in sexual intercourse with a sādhvī accumulates nine times more sin than the human who rips open the bellies. If a sādhvī engages in sexual intercourse with a sādhvī once, she accumulates a thousand times more sin, if she does it twice, she accumulates a crore times more sin, and if she does it a third time, she loses her Bodhi-samyaktvā.

Jain Terms Preserved:

The Agam Sutra 39, Cheda Sutra-5, 'Mahanisitha'
Study/Purpose/Sutra Number Sutra-1042-1043
The monk who, upon seeing a woman, becomes lustful and engages in sexual activities with her, will be reborn in a miserable state, having lost his spiritual attainment. The restrained monk or nun who indulges in sexual intercourse accumulates the karma of non-enlightenment. Through this, they bind karma suitable for rebirth in the animal and fire-bodied realms. Sutra-1044-1049
Of these three, the one who commits the offense, O Gautama! They follow the wrong path and completely destroy the right path. O Bhagavan! From this example, what will be the fate of the householders who are extremely intoxicated by passion and do not renounce women day or night? Even if they cut their body into pieces as small as a mustard seed and offer it in the fire, their impurity will not be cleansed. Even if they renounce other women and observe the vows of a Shravaka, they will attain a middling state. O Bhagavan! If they attain a middling state by practicing moderation, then why should the one who offers his body in the fire not attain purity? O Gautama! One who engages in sexual activities with his own or another's wife, or with any other person, commits a sinful act. However, he does not become bound by it. Sutra-1050-1051
If a certain soul is said to observe the Shravaka dharma and renounces the life of another woman in the threefold manner for life, he attains a middling state due to its influence. The crucial point to note here is that the one who indulges in adultery binds karma, while the one who renounces it and practices penance attains great fruit. Sutra-1052-1053
If someone, even in the slightest measure, violates the renunciation of sin, merely by a mental act, then just as the Arya named Meghamala went to a wretched state after death, so too the one who violates even a small vow by mental means alone attains a wretched state. O Kinsman of the World! I do not know what karma Meghamala accumulated by even slightly violating her vow in her mind and attained a wretched state. Sutra-1054
In the Tirtha of the Twelfth Tirthankar Lord Vasupujya, there was a Sadhvi named Meghamala, who had a body dark as lampblack and a weak mind. Sutra-1055-1058
While going out to beg for alms, she saw a beautiful house and a woman sitting there. She desired to cross over to the neighboring house. Then this Sadhvi mentally praised her, and in that moment, both of them caught fire. The Sadhvi's subtle vow was broken, as she did not criticize them there. Due to the fault of this vow-breaking, she first went to hell. Realizing this, if you desire the imperishable, infinite, and unparalleled happiness, do not allow even the slightest violation of your vows or austerities. Sutra-1059-1061
The rules for austerity, restraint, or vows are like a strict warden. One who violates these rules does not have true austerity or restraint. The fisherman, who binds sin throughout his life by catching fish, binds eight times more sin than the one who desires to break his vows. If one gains power or prosperity in one's own country and then takes Diksha, without violating one's vows, one accumulates so much merit.

Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number - 1062
A householder is inclined towards restraint and austerity, and towards the elimination of sin. Whatever religious practices they perform until they accept initiation, they benefit from them. Sūtra-1063-1064
Here, one should understand the category of sādhus and sādhvīs. O Gautama! Apart from inhalation and exhalation, no other action should be performed without the permission of the guru. Even that should be done only with jayana, not with ajayana. With ajayana, there is absolutely no breathing or holding of breath. How can one who breathes with ajayana attain austerity or dharma? Sūtra - 1065-1069
O Bhagavant! How can one follow what one has seen or known to the same extent? Those who have not yet known the ultimate truth, who are not aware of what is right and wrong, how can they follow? O Gautama! Only the Kevali Bhagavant speaks words that are beneficial for solitude. Even they do not force dharma upon a being by holding their hand. But those who follow the words spoken by the Tīrthankara Bhagavan, who are worthy of being called 'tahatti' because they behave accordingly, are saluted by Indra and the community of gods who find joy in their feet. Those who have not yet known the ultimate truth, who have not recognized the discernment of right and wrong, are like a blind person following another blind person, unaware whether the ground is water or land, mud or stone. Similarly, an ignorant person does not know whether their worship of dharma is true or false. Therefore, either one should be knowledgeable about the Gītartha-śāstra themselves, or they should live in the company of such a knowledgeable person, or they should live under the guidance of such a knowledgeable person. The śāstrakāra has permitted this for the sake of the best sādhus. There is no third option in the śāstra. Sūtra - 1070-1071
One should live with a Gītartha guru who has experienced deep emotions, is free from laziness, has firm vows, always has unblemished character, is free from attachment and aversion, has subdued the four kṣayās, has conquered the senses, and possesses such qualities. Because even though they are in a state of concealment (śruta), they are Kevalis. Sūtra - 1072-1076
O Gautama! Where a single being with a subtle earth body experiences kīlamāṇā, the all-knowing Kevali calls it alparambha. Where the life of a single being with a small earth body ends, all Kevalis call it mahārarambha. If even a little bit of a being with an earth body is crushed, it results in an asātavedanīya karma-bandha, a sinful karma that is very difficult to shed. Similarly, beings with apkāya, teūkāya, vāyukāya, vanaspatikāya, trasakāya, and those who engage in sexual intercourse, acquire slippery sinful karmas. Therefore, seeing the adverse and long-lasting fruits of the earth body and other beings due to the thought of sexual intercourse, the jāvajīva should abandon all three types of trividha. Sūtra - 1077-1082
Therefore, O Gautama! Those who do not know the ultimate truth, who are ignorant, should practice restraint and worship dharma under the guidance of a Gītartha guru, who will lead them away from the path of hell. They should drink the poison of halāhala according to the words of the Gītartha. Without any other option, they should immediately consume the poison according to their words. If considered from the perspective of the ultimate truth, it is not poison. Indeed, their words are like the taste of nectar. In this world, one who follows their words without thinking, even after death, attains nectar.
Do not drink nectar from the words of an agītartha. From the perspective of the ultimate truth, the words of an agītartha are not nectar, but they are poison, a mixture of halāhala, kālakūta, and poison. One cannot become immortal by their words. But after death, they go to hell.

**Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number:**

Those who travel on the path are hindered by obstacles, in the same way, for those who travel on the path of liberation, the company of *agītartha* and *kuśīla* is an obstacle, therefore, one should abandon their company from afar. Sūtra - 1083-1084

It is better to enter a blazing fire without hesitation and die by water, but never associate with *kuśīla* or seek their refuge. It is better to be impaled on a stake for a million years and live in comfort, but never dwell with *agītartha* even for a moment. Sūtra - 1085-1087

Even if a snake with a terrifying gaze, devoid of mantras and tantras, is hissing, it is better to seek its shelter than to associate with the unrighteousness of *agītartha* and *kuśīla*. It is better to drink the poison of *halahl* because it will kill you once, but never, even by mistake, come into contact with *agītartha*, because I would rather die a million deaths. It is better to be swallowed by a terrifying lion, tiger, or demon, than to come into contact with *agītartha*. Sūtra - 1088-1089

Consider a seven-life enemy as your own brother, but even if your father is a violator of vows and rules, consider him an enemy. It is better to enter a blazing fire than to violate even the smallest rule. A death with pure and righteous actions is beautiful, but it is not good to live by breaking the rules. Sūtra - 1090-1094

O Gautama! When the first Tirthankara Bhagavan attained liberation in accordance with the rituals, a beautiful liberation festival was celebrated, and beautiful gods and demons descended and ascended. Those who were nearby, seeing this, thought, "Oh! Today we are witnessing a wonder in the human realm. We have never seen such magic and dreams anywhere, anytime." Sūtra - 1095-1102

Thinking this, one human being remembered his past life. He was stunned for a moment, but then he was reassured by his mind. After regaining his senses, he trembled and reproached his soul for a long time. He immediately became eager to embrace monkhood. Then, with great glory, he performed the *panchamustika* ritual, and as soon as he began, the gods respectfully offered him *rajoharan*. Seeing his arduous and fierce austerities and his character, and seeing others worship him, the gods came to him and asked, "Who initiated you? Where were you born? What is your lineage? At whose lotus feet did you study the profound sūtras and their meaning?" He told them everything, including his serpent lineage, family, initiation, sūtras, and meaning, just as the Buddhas had told him. Hearing all this, the liberated one thought, "This is different. These non-Aryan people are deceiving with their show. The Jina will be just as they say." He didn't think about it anymore. Believing this, he stood silent for a long time. Sūtra - 1103-1104

Or, if that is not the case, if that Bhagavan, who has been saluted by gods and demons, can remove the doubts in my mind, then I will believe. Then he thought, "Whatever is to be, will be. What is the use of thinking here? I welcome the renunciation that destroys all suffering." That is, he desired to accept it.

In the meantime, he went to Jineśvara for knowledge. But he did not see Jineśvara. Therefore, he set out to go to Gaṇadhara Bhagavant. Gaṇadhara Mahārāja does the prarūpaṇā of the sūtra and meaning that Jineśvara Bhagavant had explained. When Gaṇadhara Mahārāja was giving a lecture here, this speaker came and said, 'One and the same earth-bodied being experiences trouble everywhere. Who can be capable of protecting him?' Sūtra - 1108-1111
In this matter, this great-renowned one belittles his own soul. It is not appropriate to prove this point in this entire world. Why would he prarūpaṇā such a thing? His lecture is quite harsh to the ears due to its bluntness. It needlessly dries up the throat. There is no other benefit. Who can behave like this? Therefore, one should abandon this teaching and preach a normal or a moderate kind of dharma. So that those who come to us do not get bored. Sūtra - 1112-1116
Either I am truly a foolish sinner, a wicked person, even though I do not behave like that, but other people do behave like that. And then the infinite knower, the omniscient Bhagavant, has prarūpaṇā this truth. Whoever speaks against his words, his meaning cannot stand. Therefore, now I will do the most difficult, excellent kind of prāyaścitta, as soon as possible, in the shortest possible time, before my death. By desiring, I have committed such a sin that even the accumulated punya of a hundred years of the devas is destroyed by it. Now he is ready to do prāyaścitta. And with his own mind and imagination, he did that kind of great, terrible prāyaścitta and went back to each Buddha. Sūtra - 1117-1123
There too, while listening to the explanation of the sūtra, the same right came again, 'The beginning of the earth etc., the virtuous one should avoid the three-fold, three-fold', being quite foolish, he started thinking like a foolish, virtuous, ignorant person, that who in this world does not begin with the earth-bodied etc.? He himself is sitting on the earth-bodied, eating food cooked with fire, and all that is born from seeds and grains. Secondly, how can one live even for a moment without water? So indeed, this directly shows the opposite truth. I came to them, but they will not believe in this matter. So let them stay here, this Gaṇadhara Bhagavant is much better. Or else, they will not accept anything I say here. Why would they preach this kind of dharma? If the dharma is extremely bitter and difficult, then don't listen to it now. Sūtra - 1124-1138
Or put them aside. I will tell you a dharma that I myself can be happy with and everyone can do. This is not the time to do this harsh, difficult dharma. As much as he was thinking, in that much time, that thunderous lightning struck. O Gautama! He died there and was born in the seventh hellish earth.
Due to the opposite of the contact of the rule, śramaṇapan, śruta-jñāna, the being suffered for a long time in hell, came here and became a great fish in the ocean, again suffered for a long time in the seventh hellish earth, for thirty-three oceans, suffered such terrible pain, came here, the being of the god, was born as a crow among the birds. From there, he went to the first hellish earth, completed his lifespan, was born here as a wicked dog, and went back to the first hellish earth. From there, he came out, was born as a lion, died again, went to the fourth, and came here. From here too, he went to hell, the being of the god was born as a potter. There, he was a leper, suffered greatly, eaten by worms, for fifty years, suffered such unbearable pain from dependence, became inactive and withered, from there he was born in the deva-bhavana, from there...

**Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number** Here, the king went to the seventh Naraka (hell) due to his own actions. In the same way, the soul of God, due to its own wrong conceptions, has been wandering in the Naraka and animal realms, and in the most wretched and lowly human realm for a long time, experiencing immense suffering and becoming extremely distressed. This is the same soul of God. Therefore, to understand the ultimate truth, one should quickly recognize the essence of such scriptures filled with the essence and become a Gītartha Muni. **Sūtra - 1139-1140**

Without recognizing the essence, the Rājju Ārya, due to the fault of being a Gītartha, earned sin by just one word. The kind of terrifying speed of control she will have to experience in the Naraka, animal realm, and the lowest human realm due to that sin, who will be able to bear hearing it? **Sūtra - 1141**

O Bhagavant! Who was that Rājju Ārya, and what kind of sinful act did she commit by just one word due to the fault of being a Gītartha, that even hearing its consequences would make one lose patience? O Gautama! In this very Bharat Kshetra, there was an Ācharya named Bhadra. He had five hundred disciples and twelve hundred Nirgranthi Sadhvis (female ascetics) who were great souls. In that Gachchha (lineage), the fourth (Ayambil) type of Rasayukta Osaman (a type of water) was used, which had three boils and three types of Achitta (unwholesome) water, but the fourth type of water was not used. Once, due to the arising of the unwholesome karma from a previous life, the Ārya named Rājja's body became rotten due to leprosy, and worms were born in it and started eating her. Once, seeing the Ārya, other Sanayatis (female ascetics) in the Gachchha asked her, "Oh, Duskarakarike! What happened to you suddenly?"

Then, O Gautama! That Rājja Ārya, who was born with the characteristics of a great sinner, replied to the Sanayatis, "This destruction of my body is due to drinking this Achitta water." As soon as she uttered these words, the hearts of all the Sanayatis were shaken. "We will also drink this Achitta water, and we will die like her." But one Sadhvi from that Gachchha thought, "Even if my body rots and breaks into pieces in the blink of an eye, I will never drink the Satchitta water in this life. I will not abandon the Achitta water." The other Sadhvi's body was destroyed by the Achitta water. What is the truth of this matter? This is absolutely not true. Because this happens due to the arising of unwholesome karma from a previous life. In this way, she started thinking very beautifully. "Look, how ignorant, foolish, and shameless this great sinner Sadhvi is, who has spoken such a wicked word that even my ears cannot enter the cavity." So, whatever poverty, misfortune, disgrace, false accusations, and suffering from leprosy and other diseases arise due to the arising of unwholesome karma from a previous life, there is no difference. Because the Āgama says in Sūtra - 1142:

"Who can give or take the suffering or happiness earned by oneself? Who can bear the karma done by oneself, and whose karma can one bear? One has to bear the consequences of one's own karma and the happiness or suffering earned by oneself." **Sūtra - 1143**

Thinking this way, that Sadhviji attained Kevalgyan (omniscience). At that time, the Devas (gods) celebrated the festival of Kevalgyan. That Kevali Sadhviji removed the veil of darkness of Samsara (cycle of birth and death) in the form of human, Deva, Asura (demon), and Sadhvi. After that, Rājja Ārya, whose heart was filled with devotion, bowed down and asked, "O Bhagavant! Why did I get such a great disease of suffering?" Then, O Gautama! Like the sound of rain-laden clouds and the Dundubhi (a type of drum), the beautiful...

The Kevali, with a deep voice, said, "O Duṣkarakārike, listen! Why did your body disintegrate? Your body was already polluted by the doshas of blood and bile, and then you ate a full meal of that oily food along with the food of the spider creature. Another reason is that, even though there are hundreds of sādhus and sādhvīs in this gaccha, you could not offer even a small amount of sachit water to the sādhus, even though they could only wash their eyes with it. Instead, you went to receive cow urine from someone whose nose and mouth were covered with rotting lint. Because of this, a buzzing bee was flying around, and you washed the mouth of that śrāvaka putra with sachit water. Because of this violation of the sachit water rule, you also broke the inviolable gaccha rules that are worthy of the worship of gods and asuras.

The devatas could not tolerate your outrageous behavior. Even in the face of death, sādhus and sādhvīs should not touch the water of wells, ponds, tanks, rivers, etc. The Vītarāga Paramātma has ordained that sādhus and sādhvīs should only consume boiled water, even if it is completely achit. Therefore, the devatas thought, "Let us teach this wicked person in such a way that no one else will ever behave like him." With this in mind, they put some powder in your food when you were eating. We are not able to know what the devatas did. Because of this, your body was destroyed, but not by drinking achit water.

At that time, Rajjā-Āryā thought, "It is as it should be. There will be no difference in the words of the Kevali." Thinking this, she begged, "O Bhagavant! If I perform the appropriate prāyaścitta, will my body be restored?" The Kevali replied, "If someone performs prāyaścitta, then they can be purified." Rajjā-Āryā said, "O Bhagavant! You are the one who should give me prāyaścitta. Who else is like you?" Then the Kevali said, "O Duṣkarakārike! I can give you prāyaścitta, but there is no prāyaścitta that can purify you." Rajjā asked, "O Bhagavant! Why can I not be purified?" The Kevali said, "You said in front of the sādhvī community that your body rotted because you consumed achit water. Hearing your words, which are like a lump of this wicked sin, the hearts of all the sādhvīs were shaken. They all began to think, 'Now we too must give up achit water.' But those sādhvīs criticized, condemned, and condemned the bad resolution in the presence of the guru. I have given them prāyaścitta.

Thus, you have earned a great sin, which is very painful, dull, frightening, bound, and clearly manifested, because of giving up achit water and because of your words. Because of that community of sin, you will become afflicted with leprosy, disease, fistula, dropsy, wind, swelling, shortness of breath, asthma, warts, goiter, and many other diseases. Then, you will suffer the pain of poverty, misfortune, disgrace, false accusations, slander, grief, anxiety, and distress for a very long time, even for countless births. You will suffer as much in the night as you do in the day. Therefore, O Gautama! This Rajjā-Āryā, because of the sin of agītārthapan, has earned such a great and painful sin simply by her words. Sūtra-1144-1146.

The sin of agītārthapan does not lead to bhāvaśuddhi. Without bhāvaśuddhi, a muni is polluted in mind. Even if there is a small amount of pollution, impurity, pain, or illusion in the heart, then the sin of agītārthapan will create a chain of suffering in the future, just as the sādhvī Lakṣmaṇā Devī created a chain of suffering. Therefore, a wise person should become gītārtha, completely free from pollution in the mind, by understanding this completely.

Agam Sutra 39, Cheda Sutra-5, 'Mahanisitha'
Study/Purpose/Sutra Number Sutra-1147-1156
O Bhagavan! I do not know about Lakshmanā Āryā, who was ignorant and impure, and due to whom the tradition of suffering was obtained. O Gautama! For the five Bharata and five Ārdraka regions, in the entire time of Utsarpinī and Avasarpinī, this is an extremely unstable thing in each universe. The state of the world is always lasting. O Gautama! I am like that, of the size of seven hands, who is worshipped by devas and asuras, just as the last Tīrthaṅkara was. At that time, there was a king named Jambūdvīpa. He had a wife named Saritā, who had many sons. Since he had no daughter, at some point the king, along with his wife, worshipped devas, clan deities, and the planets of the moon and sun to obtain a daughter. In due course, a girl was born with lotus-like eyes. She was named Lakshmanā Devī.
Now, at some point, when Lakshmanā Devī reached the age of youth, a svayaṃvara was arranged. In it, she married an excellent groom who was delightful to the eyes and like a treasure house of arts. But immediately after the marriage, her husband died. Therefore, she became completely unconscious, fainted. Her kinsmen with difficulty revived her with the cool breeze of the fan. Then, with loud wailing, she started beating her chest and head. She started crawling, hitting and beating herself in all ten directions. The kinsmen consoled her and after some days, she stopped weeping and became calm.
Sutra - 1157-1163
At some point, the Tīrthaṅkara Bhagavān, who was like the blossoming of the lotus-like living being, came there and preached in the garden. The king, along with his inner apartments, army, and vehicles, went there to worship him with devotion. After listening to the Dharma, he, along with his inner apartments, sons, and daughters, accepted dīkṣā. With auspicious mental dispositions, he started performing severe, extremely difficult, and arduous austerities without any delusion. At some point, he made everyone enter the state of the ascetic. But he did not send Lakshmanā Devī for the performance of the ritual of non-study, as she was sitting alone in the upāśraya, contemplating that the life of the loving couple is successful. She saw the pair of birds playing and thought that this bird, which is caressing its beloved, is giving it the highest bliss and happiness.
Sutra - 1164-1169
Here, when the Tīrthaṅkara Bhagavān is engaged in the erotic play of man and woman, why did we prohibit seeing them? They, being free from the pain of suffering, cannot recognize the happiness of others. Although fire has the nature of burning, if seen with the eyes, it does not burn the seer. Or no, no, no, no, what the Bhagavān has commanded is indeed true. They will not act in the opposite way. Seeing the pair of birds playing, my mind was disturbed. The desire for a man has manifested in me, that I should engage in sexual intercourse with him. But today I have contemplated that I cannot even do it in a dream. And further, in this birth, I have not desired a man even in my mind. If I have not even desired him in a dream, then I am indeed an unfortunate sinner with a perverse nature, and I have hoped for the Tīrthaṅkara by thinking crooked and false.
Sutra - 1170-1173
The Tīrthaṅkara Bhagavān has also taught the extremely difficult, severe, and arduous vow that is to be observed. Then who can be capable of observing this vow in the threefold manner? Even after properly practicing with speech and body, it is not possible to protect with the third, the mind. Or the concern for suffering is taken. This is still done comfortably, one who has become pure-minded is considered skilled in all activities. So, having doubts on this subject, if suddenly this lapse has occurred to me and I have incurred a fault, let me quickly perform the expiation by self-reflection and observance.

Study/Purpose/Sutra Number Sutra- 1174-1177
I am the first great Sadhvi within all the virtuous and chaste. I am ahead of all in the same way as a line. In the same way, there is an announcement in heaven. And everyone worships the dust of my feet. Because everyone is purified by its dust. In this way, my fame has spread in the world. Now if I am being criticized. If I reveal my mental fault to the Bhagvant, then my brothers, mother, father will be saddened by hearing this, or if I have thought something in my mind by mistake in any way, I have criticized it, just by hearing this, what sorrow will my relatives have? Sutra- 1178-1182
_ As soon as I was ready to take criticism by thinking in this way, I was standing, then a thorn pierced into the sole of my foot. At that time, the Sadhvi, being disheartened and hopeless, started thinking that oh dear! A thorn had never pierced my foot in this birth, so what will happen in this matter (inauspicious)? Or I understood the Dharma that two birds were fighting, I approved of them, because of that my virtuous vows were violated. Coral, deaf, blind, leprous, rotten-bodied, ashamed, even the gods praise him until he does not break his vows. The thorn pierced my foot, because of this, I have made a mistake, I will get great benefit from it. Sutra- 1183-1188
_ A woman who breaks her vows even in her mind, if she goes to the seven Narakas in the lineage of seven generations within the underworld. Why did I make this mistake? So now, until a thunderbolt or dust falls on me, until my heart is broken into a hundred pieces, even that will be considered a great wonder. Secondly, maybe I will be criticized for this, then people will think that the daughter of some people has made such an inauspicious decision in her mind. Because of that, I will do such an experiment, and others will have thought that how much penance should be given to her. I will be criticized in such a way that I have thought in such a way, no one else knows. The Bhagvant will give the penance for this sin, even if it is very severe and firm, even then I will do that much penance after hearing what he has said. Until the beautiful vows and character are free from the three types of impurities, the sin does not go away. Sutra- 1189-1194
Now that Lakshman Sadhvi started doing penance by accepting criticism on behalf of others, she fasted for fifty years for the sake of penance, for six days and eight days, she fasted for ten years. She did not do it for herself, nor did she get it done, no one prepared food by taking a vow of a Sadhu, the food was left over from the house of the householder who ate it, she would complete her fast with that food, she would eat chickpeas for two years. She would do the Masakshaman penance for sixteen years continuously. She would do the Ayambil penance for twenty years. She would not leave any necessary action on any day. She would do all this penance with a mind free from day and night, for the sake of penance, O Gautam! Then she started thinking that the penance I did, did it not remove the sin from my heart? What I had thought in my mind at that time. On the other hand, I have accepted penance. Will it not be considered as conduct? Thinking this, she died. Sutra- 1195-1198
By doing severe, painful, and extremely severe penance, that Lakshman Sadhvi, due to her free penance, was born as a light-hearted servant who did obscene work in the house of a prostitute, her name was Khandoṣṭhā. She was very sweet-spoken, she carried heavy loads of liquor and grass, she was humble to all the prostitutes.

Agam Sutra 39, Cheda Sutra-5, 'Mahanisitha'

The study/purpose/sutra numbers and their old women were four times more respectful. Even though her beauty and radiance were endowed, she was bald-headed. One day, the old women started contemplating that there is no such beauty, form, and radiance like mine in this abode, so I should disfigure her nose, ears, and lips in such a way.

Sutra - 1199-1202
When she becomes youthful, my daughter will not have any desire for her. Or it is not appropriate to do so to her like a daughter. This is quite humble. If she goes somewhere else from here, I will make her such that she may not find a place to live even in another country and return back. I will give her such a subjugation that her private part gets rotten. I will put shackles on her hands and feet so that she gets out of control and make her wear old clothes and lie down with anguish in the mind.

Sutra-1203-1208
After that, seeing herself in the dream with the rotten private part, shackled, ears and nose cut off from the Khandoshtha, she fled from there in such a way that no one would know the true meaning of the dream, and wandered around the village, town, city, and pattana, and after six months, she reached a place called Sankheda. There she joined with a wealthy son of a prostitute like Kubera. The first wife started burning with jealousy. Trembling with their anger, she spent some days in that way.

One night, when Khandoshtha was sleeping in deep sleep, she suddenly went to the fireplace, took the burning wood, and inserted it into her private part in such a way that it burst open and reached her heart. After that, she started wailing in a sorrowful voice. She started crawling and rubbing back and forth like a moving stone.

Sutra-1209-1214
And then the married woman started contemplating that she should be made such that she cannot stand for life, so that my beloved does not remember her for a hundred births. Then, heating an iron pot in the potter's workshop until it becomes red-hot, she forcefully inserted it into her yoni in such a way that, due to this severe pain, she died there and was born as the jewel of a queen of a Chakravarti.

In this way, the wife of the son of a prostitute, out of anger, pierced her body, even though there was no life in it, and cut it into small pieces and threw it in all directions for the dogs and crows to eat. Meanwhile, the son of the prostitute who had gone out also returned home. He started contemplating in his mind. Reaching the lotus feet of the ascetic, he accepted initiation and attained liberation.

Sutra-1215-1219
Now the soul of Lakshmana Devi, after being a jewel of a woman in Khandoshthipana, O Gautama! reached the sixth hell. There, after enduring the extremely severe and terrifying suffering of the hellish abode for a long time, this soul of hers was born in the animal womb as a dog. There, she became obsessed with lust and started engaging in sexual intercourse. There, a bull kicked her yoni, and an injury occurred. The yoni came out, and for ten years, worms were born in it and started eating it. There, O Gautama! she was born in the raw womb 99 times and suffered the pain of the womb.

Sutra-1220-1226
After that, she was born in the house of a poor human, but two months later, her mother died. Then her father, by going from house to house, made her drink milk and kept her alive with great suffering. Then he kept her in Gokula like a cowherd boy. There, the calves of the cows, while drinking the milk of their mothers, were tied with ropes, and the cows were milked.

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Mahānishīth'

**Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number** Due to the hindrance karma earned, the soul of Lakshmanā did not receive breast milk until the Koḍakoḍī Bhavantara. Bound by ropes, halting, shackled, suppressed, experiencing separation from mother etc., it wandered in the Bhava for a long time. After that, it was born as a Dākana woman in the human womb. There, the dog-keeper injured her and left. From there, after death, it attained human form here and due to the defects of the body, in this Mahāpṛthvī Mandala, in a village with five houses - a city, town or a Pattana, it did not experience even a moment of happiness, not even half a Phora. **Sūtra - 1227-1232**

O Gautam! Even in that human form, feeling many agonizing sorrows similar to the suffering of the Naraka, the soul of Lakshmanā Devi, due to the fault of extreme Raudra Dhyāna, died and was born in the Kharahaḍ Naraka in the seventh Naraka Pṛthvī. Experiencing such great suffering there, after completing the lifespan of thirty-three Sagaropama, it was born as a barren cow. It would enter other people's fields and courtyards, causing damage, breaking bushes and eating fodder. Then, many people gathered and took it to a muddy place where it could not escape. It got stuck there and could not get out. While trapped, that poor cow was eaten by aquatic creatures. Crows and jackals pecked at it. The soul of that cow, filled with anger, died and was born as a snake with vision-poison in the Marwaḍ desert, devoid of water and grains. From that serpent form, it again reached the fifth Naraka Pṛthvī. **Sūtra - 1233-1239**

In this way, O Gautam! The soul of Lakshmanā Sādhvī, after enduring intense suffering for a long time, wandering in the four Gati forms of the world, in Naraka, Tiryanch and Kumānavapan, will again be born as the soul of the श्रेणीक king, who will be the first Tirthankara, Padmanābha, in the upcoming twenty-four. It will be born as a Kubjikā in the village of Śarīrasībī, which is like a mine. It will not be able to give joy by seeing its mother. At that time, everyone will think, "This is a cause of anxiety," and will apply a paste of Meśagerū on its body, make it ride a donkey and take it around. They will then attach birds on both sides of its body, play a Didim with a hollow sound in front of it, take it around in one village, then take it out to another place and it will not be able to enter the village again. Then, living in the forest, it will eat roots and fruits. Due to the sting of a poisonous insect in the middle of its navel, it will suffer pain and develop skin diseases like scabies, eczema, and itch all over its body. It will scratch itself and experience unbearable suffering. **Sūtra - 1240-1241**

While suffering, Padmanābha Tirthankara Bhagavan will hold a Samvasarana there and it will see him. Therefore, immediately, it and other Bhavyas living in that country, and women whose bodies are also afflicted with diseases and pain, will be freed from all community diseases by the sight of the Tirthankara Bhagavan. Along with it, the soul of Lakshmanā Sādhvī, who is Kubjikā, will consume intense penance and end its suffering. **Sūtra - 1242**

O Gautam! This is the Lakshmanā Āryā who, due to the fault of Agītārthapan, received the tradition of suffering of a mind with slight pollution. **Sūtra - 1243-1244**

O Gautam! Just as this Lakshmanā Āryā received the tradition of suffering, understand that to receive the tradition of infinite Agītārtha suffering of a polluted mind, one should be completely Gītārtha in all respects, or remain under their command with Agītārtha, and have a very pure, clear, spotless, and free from impurities mind. In that way, Bhagavan...

Study/Purpose/Sūtrāṅka heard from near. Sūtra-1245-1250
Oh Jagadguru! Lord of the world, Dharma Tīrthaṅkara, recognizing the past and future, who have burnt the parts of all karma through penance, destroyer of Kāmadeva, the enemy, ending the group of four kṣayās, compassionate towards all beings in the world, destroying the deep darkness of the night of Mithyātva, the form of intense darkness, illuminating the Lokāloka with pure knowledge, conquering the enemy of delusion, who have renounced the thieves of attachment, aversion, and delusion from afar, more gentle than a hundred moons, giving happiness, with unparalleled strength, prowess, and influence, with unmatched great fame in the three worlds, with incomparable form, who cannot be compared to anyone, eternal form, giving liberation, complete with all characteristics, adorned with the Lakshmi of the three worlds, Oh Bhagavan! Whatever is done in order - by tradition - the work is achieved. But how can the work be achieved without order, like the milk of a sheep, suddenly, at an inopportune time? Sūtra-1251-1253
In the first birth, Samyagdarshana, in the second birth, Anu-vrat, in the third birth, Samāyika Charitra, in the fourth birth, Pauṣdha, in the fifth, Durdhara Brahmacharya-vrat, in the sixth, the renunciation of Sachitta, according to that, in the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth births, the renunciation of food, etc., which was prepared for oneself - to give - was resolved. In the eleventh birth, one becomes like a Shraman in qualities. Why is it not said for the restrained according to this order? Sūtra-1254-1256
Hearing such difficult things, the children with little intelligence become anxious, the faith of some people is shaken, just as elephants run away in all directions at the sound of a lion, so children run away in all directions hearing the difficult Dharma. That kind of difficult accumulation, the wicked, the evil-minded, the delicate-bodied, do not even want to hear. So how can they be prepared to behave in that way? Oh Gautam! Tell me, besides the Tīrthaṅkara Bhagavan, is there anyone else in this world who behaves in such a difficult way? Sūtra-1257-1260
Even when they were in the womb, Devendra had made an amrita-filled thumb. With devotion, Indra Maharaja also gave food to Bhagavan. And always praised him. In the Devlok, when they were Chavyas, and in the house where they took birth, their house was always showered with gold due to their flower-like influence. Those who were born in their womb. In that country, all kinds of calamities, death, disease, enemies, due to their merit-influence, go away, as soon as they are born, the trembling community, on Mount Meru, with all prosperity, celebrated the bathing festival of Bhagavan and went to their place. Sūtra - 1261-1266
Oh, their wonderful beauty, radiance, brilliance, and form are also incomparable. If one thinks about the form of just one toe of Jinendra Bhagavan, then gather the form of all the Devatas in all the Devlokas, multiply it by crores, even then the form of Bhagavan's toe increases considerably. That is, it is like placing black coal among red embers, there is so much difference in form. The Devatas took refuge, the three knowledges, the group of arts, the wonder, the mind of the people, the family members of relatives, the Devatas and Asuras, the worshiped, the hope of the loving group, the place of supreme happiness for the world, the enjoyment of the wealth, the royal splendor, which they had earned by penance in the previous birth, for a long time, they knew from the knowledge of the period that this Lakshmi is indeed of the nature of being destroyed as soon as it is seen. Oh, this Lakshmi is the one that increases sin. So why don't we take Charitra?

Study/Purpose/Sūtrāṅka Sūtra-1267-1269
As many as such mind-results occur, so many times the Lokāntika Devas request the Bhagavant - "O Bhagavant! You, the Dharma tīrtha, who benefits the beings of the world, please initiate (the path)." At that time, abandoning all sins, giving up the attachment to the body, abandoning the wealth of the entire world like a straw, they engage in the practice of the fourfold conduct, which is the essential cause of austerity and liberation, which is rare even for Indra, which is detached, intense, painful, extremely difficult, and excellent in the entire world. Sūtra- 1270-1274
And then, those who desire the happiness of this birth, who are desirous of rare things, even though they are desirous of things, cannot obtain them easily. O Gautama! Only as much as a drop of honey, only that much happiness can be obtained even after enduring suffering until death. How much is their ignorance? Or, O Gautama! You see directly the kind of humans who experience trivial, small happiness, which no human is willing to listen to. Some humans extract blood forcibly for the sake of crimson color, to strengthen the human body. Some make them do the work of a farmer. Some make them herd cows. Slavery, servitude, foot trade, various kinds of disciples, jobs, farming, commerce, life-giving, such painful, laborious, courageous tasks, poverty, lack of wealth, etc., and working from house to house. Sūtra - 1275-1278
Others, hiding themselves from others, walk making a "dhin-dhin" sound, walking with a naked, open body, experiencing the pain of not having clothes to wear, even those old, torn, and tattered clothes that are obtained with great difficulty, they wear and use those torn clothes, saying, "I will sew them today, I will sew them tomorrow." Even then, O Gautama! Understand clearly and explicitly that, abandoning the customs of the world and the work of relatives, abandoning enjoyment, enjoyment, and charity, etc., they eat bad food. Sūtra- 1279-1280
Running around, hiding, saving, accumulating wealth, even a small amount, for a long time, day and night, with anger, sending half, a quarter, or a twentieth of it. In some way, they accumulate wealth, lakhs or crores, over a long period of time. Where one desire is fulfilled, another immediately arises. But other desires are not fulfilled. Sūtra- 1281-1283
O Gautama! Such a desire for rare things and delicacy is obtained at the time of initiation into Dharma. But they do not hinder in the Karimba. Because where one has a morsel in his mouth, another comes and places a stick of wood near him, but does not even set foot there. And he plays with lakhs of women. Even such people, hearing about others who are more prosperous, desire to make their country independent and make their master obey their orders. Sūtra- 1284-1289
If they do not obey directly, then they make them obey by using the policies of Sama, Bheda, Dama, Danda, etc. How many things does he have, such as an army, etc.? To know his courage, he has him investigated through secret agents. Or, he goes alone, wearing his own clothes, in secret. After crossing large mountains, forts, forests, and rivers, after enduring many sorrows and pains for a long time, he reaches there, with a weak throat from hunger, with pain,

**Āgama Sūtra 39, Chhedasūtra-5, 'Mahānishīth'**

A seeker, wandering from house to house begging for alms, tries to find out the secrets and hidden matters of that kingdom, but cannot find out.
After that, if he somehow survives and starts to accumulate merit, then he should enter the house after changing his body and appearance. At that time, if he is asked who he is, he should reveal his character in food, etc. He should defeat the king by fighting, being ready to fight, with all his army, vehicles and prowess, and breaking into pieces. Sūtra - 1289-1292

Perhaps he is defeated by that king, then he falls down with his face down in the battlefield filled with elephants, horses and weapons, with his body scarred by the blood flowing from many blows. Then, O Gautama! Where did the desire to obtain rare things, bad habits and delicacy go at that time? Who, being only a seeker of delicate things, never thought of setting foot on the ground after washing only half of his body with his own hand. Such humans also found such a state. Sūtra - 1293-1297

_ If he is told to do good deeds, he replies that he is not capable. Then, O Gautama! Such a creature, who is poor, unfortunate, and does evil deeds, never has the wisdom to be inclined towards the place of religion. He says that this religion is easy to do in one birth, just like eating and drinking will be available to us, then he should preach religion according to the wishes of those who desire it. Then, even without performing vows and rules, a living being desires liberation, such a creature should not be angry, he should preach religion to them in that way. But do not tell them about liberation, such people will not be liberated and it will be a false statement. Sūtra - 1298-1302

The second Tirthankara Bhagavan also did not have attachment, aversion, delusion, fear, and free behavior in the past, and will not have it in the future. O Gautama! The Tirthankara Bhagavan never speaks falsehood. Because they have direct omniscience, they see the whole world directly. Past, future, present, merit-demerit, and everything that is in the three realms is revealed to them, even if the underworld goes up to heaven and heaven goes down, surely there will be no difference in the words of the Tirthankara. They reveal the path of knowledge-vision, character, severe and difficult penance, and liberation, as it is. Otherwise, they are not Tirthankara by word, mind or action. Sūtra - 1303-1304

Perhaps the destruction of this world happens immediately, even then, they are called Tirthankara by compassion for the welfare of all the beings, creatures, and ghosts of the world, in the way that they preach the true religion. There is no fear of misfortune, sorrow, poverty, disease, sorrow, or bad destiny for those who practice the religion well. And there is no suffering or anxiety. Sūtra - 1305-1306

O Bhagavan! We do not want to say that we behave according to our own will. We only ask that he do as much as possible. O Gautama! It is not right to do so, it is not beneficial to think about it even for a moment, if you think so, know that his strength has been killed. Sūtra - 1307-1310

One human is capable of eating ghee-candy rabdi. Another is powerful enough to play with wine and meat, and a third is powerful enough to play with women, and a fourth cannot do any of these, another can argue, establishing the previous side, that is, he can debate. Another, who is of the nature of suffering, cannot debate. What one does

Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'
Study/Purpose/Sutra number should be seen and other nonsense should be done. No one steals, no one commits Jar Karma, no one does anything. Some are not able to eat or leave their bed. And they are powerful enough to sit on the stage. O Gautam! Truly, we do not call such giving Miccha Mi Dukkadam. I will answer the other thing you say in Sutra-1311-1313
Even if a human being is not able to perform all the severe austerities in this birth, he still desires to attain salvation. The milk of a bird, plucking a hair, wearing a dashi of Rajoharan, observing such rules, but even these rules are not able to be followed till Javajeev, then O Gautam! For him, will there be any other field of Siddhi than this according to your wisdom? Sutra-1314-1317
Again, I answer your question that the masters of the four knowledges, the gods, the demons, and the beings of the world, are definitely those who will attain liberation in that very existence. There will be no other existence. Even then, they consume the severe, painful, and extremely difficult austerities without hiding their strength, vigor, effort, and courage. Then, the other beings who are afraid of the birth, death, and other sorrows of the world in the form of four motions, should follow the practice of all things as they are, as the Tirthankara Bhagavan has commanded. Sutra-1318-1323
O Gautam! You have said that one should perform the practices as described in the order of tradition. O Gautam! Listen to an example! A turtle, frightened by the collision of many crocodiles and other creatures in the vast ocean, sinks in the water, is bitten by another powerful creature, is choked, is thrown up, is pushed, is swallowed, is terrified, hides, runs, escapes, jumps and falls in every direction, is tossed about, suffers many kinds of troubles, endures, barely finds a place anywhere for a moment, is tormented by sorrow, after a long time, while wading through the water, reaches the upper part. In the upper part was a forest of Padmini trees, where the Lil Pushpa trees were so dense that nothing could be seen in the upper part, but while wandering around, he saw a crack in the ground with Neelphool flowers, at that time, as it was Sharad Purnima, the full moon, adorned with planets and stars, was visible in the clear sky. Sutra - 1324-1328
And then he saw the developed, shining blue and white lotus, the hundred-petaled moon, the blooming lotus, and other fresh vegetation, heard the sweet sounds of swans and Karand birds, Chakravak, etc. He had never seen such a wonderful, radiant moon in the seventeenth lineage, and for a moment he thought, "This must be heaven?" Then, thinking, "If I show this beautiful picture to my friends, they will also be happy," he went to call his friends. After a long time, he found them and brought them back here. As he had returned on the night of Krishna Chaturdashi in the month of Bhadrapada, which was a dark, deep night, he could not see the prosperity he had seen before, and he wandered around many times, but he could not see the beauty of the night of Sharad Purnima. Sutra-1328-1329
In the same way, it is rare for a being in the ocean of existence, which is in the form of four motions, to attain humanhood. After attaining it, those who become complacent after obtaining the Dharma with the characteristic of non-violence, will again be able to attain such humanhood, which they can attain after suffering for millions of births, just as the turtle could not see the prosperity again, so too, that being is not able to attain the beautiful prosperity of Dharma.

If one has to travel outside the village for two or three days, then one takes all the necessary things for the journey, food allowance, etc., and then sets out. Why then does one not contemplate the provisions of Dharma for the long journey of the transmigration of the world, which has eighty-four lakh Yonis and four states? As the hours, days, months, and years pass, so too does the great, sorrowful death draw near. Such is the understanding that anyone who does not know the time of death, perhaps even if they did know, no one in this world has been or will be immortal. Sūtra - 1334
These sinful beings, being heedless, are diligent in the work of the world, and even after suffering, they do not get tired, and O Gautama! they are not satisfied even with happiness. Sūtra - 1335-1338
This being has been born in hundreds of species and has shed countless bodies, but even if all the bodies were gathered together, they would fill the three worlds. Even the nails, teeth, head, nose, eyes, ears, etc., that have been shed from the body, if they were all collected separately, would form mountains as high as Mount Meru. All the food that this being has consumed, if it were all gathered together, would be heavier than the Himalayas, Malaya, Meru, the islands, the oceans, and the earth. The tears that this being has shed due to the weight of suffering, if they were all collected, would not fit in all the wells, ponds, rivers, and oceans. Sūtra - 1339-1341
Even the milk that was drunk from the mother's breast would be greater than the ocean water. In this infinite world, there are many Yonis of women, and among them, if a dog died seven days ago and its Yoni has rotted, the worms that are born in it, and the excrement that the being has left behind, if they were all collected and piled up as high as the fourteenth Rajapramāṇaloka, from the seventh hell to the Siddhikshetra, then there would be as many infinite piles of worms and excrement as there are Yonis. Sūtra - 1342-1343
This being has enjoyed all kinds of pleasures for an infinite time. Yet, every moment, the pleasures of the senses seem incomplete. Just as a person suffering from itching and pain due to heat and cold scratches their body and considers the pain to be pleasure, so too do humans, in their delusion, consider the pain of worldly desires to be pleasure. They recognize and experience the suffering caused by birth, old age, and death. Yet, O Gautama! the being who is about to depart for a bad destination does not become detached from the objects of the senses. Sūtra - 1344-1346
The evil spirits, who are more powerful than the sun, moon, and all the planets, and who are the instigators of all evils, are the tormentors of the entire world, and are bound by desire. They are the great planets, the planets of desire. Ignorant, dull-witted beings know that wealth and prosperity are the fruits of all Dharma, yet they are very foolish and commit sins, leading them to a bad destination. Sūtra - 1347-1349
The body of a being is subject to death at any moment due to disturbances in the vāta, pitta, kapha, dhātus, and jathrāgni. Therefore, strive for Dharma and do not be disheartened. It is very rare to find such a beautiful opportunity for Dharma. In this world, it is very rare for a being to be born with five senses, to be human, to be an Ārya, to be born in a noble family, to have the company of a sage, to hear the scriptures, to have faith in the words of the Tīrthankara, to have good health, to be ordained, etc. Even after obtaining all these rare things, a being can die in a moment due to a spear, a snake, poison, dysentery, water, weapons, fire, a wheel, etc., and be reborn in another body.

  Until you have a little bit of life left, until you can still do a little business, practice self-interest. Otherwise, you will have the opportunity to repent later. Like a rainbow, lightning, which disappears in an instant, this body is like a dream, like water filled in an earthen pot, which melts in an instant. Understanding this, until you are freed from this ephemeral body, practice intense, painful, severe austerities. There is no guarantee when the cycle of life will break. O Gautama! Even those who practice restraint for a thousand years in great abundance, their defilements do not become pure like a lotus at the end. Some great souls, like Puṇḍarīka Maharshi, achieve their goal in a short time, just as they have taken on conduct and śramaṇya. Sūtra-1355-1356
This being, surrounded by the suffering of birth, old age, and death, has no happiness in the world, therefore liberation is the only worthy object of instruction. O Gautama! To attain liberation in all ways and in all respects, this human birth received is meaningful.

O Bhagavant! In this illustration, you had earlier said that according to the prescribed order, why do you not tell me the Prayashchitta? O Gautama! If you adopt it, then the Prayashchitta is indeed considered a more beautiful thought than your manifest religious thought. Then Gautama asked, then the Bhagavant said that as long as there is doubt in the body-soul, there is Mithyatva, and its Prayashchitta does not occur. Sutra - 1360-1361
One who has been defeated by Mithyatva, speaks contrary to the words of the Tirthankara Bhagavant, violates their words, praises one who does so, then that contradictor enters the deep, dense darkness and ignorant hell. But one who beautifully thinks that - the Tirthankara Bhagavant themselves say this, and they themselves behave accordingly. Sutra - 1362-1363
O Gautama! There are also such Jivas who, having accepted Pravrajya in some way or the other, serve religion in such a manner that they cannot be liberated from the worldly cycle. Which are the verses of that method? O Gautama! Know that method of verses in this way. Sutra-1364-1365
Chaitya-vandana, Pratikramana, faith in the existence of Jiva-adika tattvas, five Samitis, control of five senses, three Guptis, restraint of four Kashays, being vigilant in all of them, knowing and trusting the conduct and activities of Sadhupana, after examining the attached faults, free from Shalya, greatly agitated due to the sufferings of the womb-abode etc., always fearful of the sufferings of birth, old age, death etc., always meditates in the heart to burn the karmas of the four gati-form Samsara. Sutra - 1366-1368
If one who has obtained the excellent ship-boat of right belief, knowledge and conduct in this human form, has fallen out of it, then I will wander and roam around in the boundless ocean of Samsara without reaching the end of suffering. Then when will that day come when I will wander, being impartial to enemy and friend, always engaged in auspicious meditation, and then I will make efforts so that I do not have to take birth again. Sutra - 1369-1371
Facing the great desired goal that has been contemplated for a long time, exhilarated by the joy of that great wealth, dependent on the grace of devotion, with hair standing on end, filled with bliss in every limb, enthusiastically raising the eighteen thousand Shilanga, eager to observe the thirty-six types of conduct, devoid of the entire Mithyatva, O Gautama! Conduct accordingly. Sutra-1372-1373

Adopting the study/purpose/sūtra number, abandoning attachment and aversion from afar, remaining with an earnest, fierce meditation, being averse to distortion. Sūtra - 1374-1375

Whoever anoints their body and arms with the juice of forty-two sandalwood trees, or shaves their body with a bamboo, whoever praises their qualities or criticizes their faults, one who remains equanimous towards both, without concealing their strength, vigor, effort, and courage, with an equal mind towards grass and gems, a drum and gold, with vows, rules, knowledge, conduct, austerities, etc., unique in the entire universe, auspicious, characterized by non-violence, with a steady and unique characteristic for the ten types of religious observances like forgiveness, etc., suitable for all necessary study and meditation at that time, unimpeded for countless and numerous places of restraint, striving for the complete avoidance of negligence, being diligent and austere, and then again, repenting for past transgressions and preventing possible future transgressions, being restrained from transgressions, therefore abandoning sinful actions like those that are not to be done in the present, being free from all faults, and then again, being free from the root of worldly growth, i.e., being liberated, not performing the worship of the liberated discourse for the sake of external happiness in this world or the next, abandoning ‘lying with deceit’, such a sage or saint, endowed with the qualities mentioned above, if I have found them to have slipped from restraint through negligence in any way, at any time, in any place, through mind, speech, or body, through the purification of the three instruments, with all my being, then for them, if they are in a place of purification, there is only atonement.

_O Gautama! For that reason, teach them purification through atonement, but not in any other way. The atonement that is mentioned in each and every place of atonement, as much as is mentioned, is certainly called the determined atonement. O Bhagavant! Why is it said so? O Gautama! These atonement sūtras are in an endless, continuous sequence. Many blessed souls, bound in the prison house of the world, in the form of the four states of existence, will be freed from the suffering of being bound and afflicted, and will quickly be freed from the shackles of karma, in the form of chains, that they have accumulated in their past lives. These atonement sūtras are endowed with many oceans of qualities, they are firm in their vows and conduct, and are suitable for solitude. They should be taught in a place where no one else can hear them, and they should be explained in such a way that the atonement that leads to the highest purification for each individual, according to their capacity, should be given to them with words that arouse enthusiasm, with attachment and aversion, creating an unprecedented taste for religion. Therefore, such atonement is proven and authentic. It is called the determined atonement. Sūtra - 1376-1377_

O Bhagavant! How many types of atonement are prescribed? O Gautama! Ten types of atonement are prescribed, and they are of many types even within the category of ‘pārancita’. O Bhagavant! For how long will the practice of these atonement sūtras be carried out? O Gautama! Until the king named Kalki dies, the earth will be adorned with a Jinalaya, and there will be an ascetic named Śrīprabha. Until then, the practice of the atonement sūtras will be carried out. O Bhagavant! What will happen after that? After that, there will be no one who is fortunate enough to have this Śruta Skandha explained to them. Sūtra - 1378

O Bhagavant! How many places of atonement are there? O Gautama! The number of places of atonement is said to be countless. O Bhagavant! Which is the first step of atonement among those countless places of atonement? O Gautama! Knowing the daily actions. O Bhagavant! What are those daily actions called? O Gautama! Those that are repeatedly performed, day and night, from the destruction of the life force to the performance of countless necessary actions, are called necessary actions.

O Bhagavant! Why is it called ‘necessary’ by that name? O Gautama! Because it destroys all eight karmas, and it is the means of achieving the highest right faith, knowledge, and conduct, and it is the practice of very intense, heroic, fierce, difficult, and arduous austerities.

Agam Sutra 39, Cheda Sutra-5, 'Mahanisitha'

The Acharya says that the practice (anushthana) of worshipping the Tirthankaras and others at any time, day or night, from birth onwards, through study, contemplation, preaching, and exposition, is certainly a must-do activity. It is considered essential.

O Gautama! The monks who violate or are lax in the timely performance of this practice are negligent, create disbelief in others by acting against the prescribed procedure, and despite having strength and vigor, are negligent in any essential activity. They cling to the support of indolence or sensual indulgence, delay or hurry in performing the prescribed rituals. Such monks incur a great penance.

O Lord! What is the second stage of penance? O Gautama! The second, third, fourth, fifth, and so on, up to infinite stages of penance are to be understood as included within the first stage of penance.

O Lord! Why do you say so? O Gautama! The monk who carefully utilizes the time for all essential activities, becomes completely free from the supports of inauspicious contemplation, attachment, aversion, passions, pride, and possessiveness. He immerses himself entirely in the activities of knowledge, perception, conduct, austerities, study, meditation, and the beautiful Dharma, without concealing his strength, vigor, and prowess, and becomes completely absorbed in them. When he becomes engrossed in the essential activities of the beautiful Dharma, he effectively blocks the inflow of karmic influx, and with the power of his soul, destroys the entire group of eight inauspicious karmas accumulated since beginningless time. He attains liberation from the bondage of the cycle of birth, old age, and death, and resides on the summit of the three worlds, the abode of the Siddhas, free from all suffering. Therefore, it is said that the other stages of penance are included within the first stage.

O Lord! What are those essential activities? Such as Chaitya-vandana, etc. O Lord! In which essential activity, if one repeatedly violates the time, or performs it negligently, or does not perform it properly at the prescribed time, or is not ready, or does not depart, or does not complete it, or performs it late, or does not perform it at all, or is negligent, what penance is prescribed for such a person?

O Gautama! The monk or nun who, from the day of their initiation, regularly and with great devotion, condemns past misdeeds, avoids future transgressions, and refrains from committing any present misdeeds, who has completely renounced all faults, and who, while reciting the sutras and their meanings with one-pointed attention, without getting distracted, and with a virtuous resolve, does not venerate the Chaitya at the three times, should be given the penance of one day's fast for the first offense, Cheda-prayashchitta for the second offense, and Upsthapana for the third offense, as not venerating the Chaitya in the prescribed manner creates disbelief in others. Therefore, this is considered a major penance.

Further, for plucking, causing to be plucked, or approving the plucking of green vegetation, seeds, flowers, or using them for worship, adornment, or decoration, the penances of Upsthapana, Kshaman-upavasa, Chaturtha-bhakta, Ayanmbil, Ekasana, Nivigadha, and Agadha should be understood in a gradual manner.

Accordingly, one who does not perform the Pratilekhana of a residence or Upadhi should be given Upasthāpana.

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Mahānishīth'

According to the study/purpose/sūtra number, after transcribing the residence epithet, with a concentrated mind, without being disturbed, one should recite it. Then, with a concentrated mind, carefully following the sūtra and its meaning, if one does not transgress the Iryāvahīyam, then one should perform Ekāsana, Vandana Pratikramṇa, and Iryā Pratikramṇa without taking Muhpaṭṭi. One should eat Bangasā without taking Muhpaṭṭi, perform Swādhyāya, give Vācanā, etc. In all places, according to the Purimaḍḍu, one should perform Iryā Pratikramṇa. The residence should be soft, smooth, free of grease, not hard, not riddled with holes from insects, and not cleaned with a stick with a knot or a tail. If one does not clean the residence with a stick with a knot or a tail, then one should perform Ekāsana. If one cleans the residence with a broom, then one should perform Upasthāpana. If one does not recite the garbage collected in the residence with a stick with a knot or a tail, then one should perform Upavās. If one recites the garbage without performing Pratipekṣaṇā, then one should perform five Upavās. But if there is a Ṣaṭpadīkā or any other living being, then one should perform Upavās. If there is no living being, then one should perform Upasthāpana. If one observes the garbage in the residence and finds a Ṣaṭpadīkā in it, one should search for it, separate it, collect it, and take it. If such a Prāyaścitta is not shared among all the monks, then one should perform Ekāsana. If one takes the Ṣaṭpadīkā oneself and does not perform Prāyaścitta division, then one should perform Pārancit. If one does not accept each other from within, then one should perform Pārancit.

According to that, one should clean the residence properly with a stick with a knot or a tail, carefully observe the Kājā, separate the Ṣaṭpadīkā from the Kājā, and recite the Kājā. A monk who remembers the sūtra, its meaning, and both of them with a concentrated mind, with proper method, with sufficient use, and with a concentrated mind, and does not transgress the Iryā Pratikramṇa, should perform the Prāyaścitta of Āyambil and Upavās.

According to that, O Gautama! We will explain further. One who transgresses that - at a time when there is one and a half ghaḍī less than the first pahora of the day, a monk who goes to the Guru with proper method, saying "Sazzhāy Sandisāūṁ" - with a concentrated mind, with a firm determination, with use in the Śruta, one who does not take Apūrvajnāna daily in the first porīsī with one ghaḍī less, with the acceptance of Jāvajjīva, should perform the Prāyaścitta of five Upavās. If one cannot read Apūrvajnāna, then one should remember the sūtra, its meaning, and both of them with a concentrated mind, and not divert one's attention. If one spends time in frivolous talk about food, women, kings, thieves, countries, etc., and indulges in the mind, then one is not worthy of Vandana. Those who have not read before, and for whom it is impossible to take Apūrvajnāna, should also perform the Parāvartan of Pañca Mangala in the first porīsī with one ghaḍī less. If one does not do so, and indulges in frivolous talk or listens to meaningless external talk, then one is Avandanīya.

According to that, a monk who performs Swādhyāya with a concentrated mind in the first porīsī with one ghaḍī less, and then does not transcribe the Pātra, Mātraka, Kāmaḍha-Pātra, or special garment, vessel, equipment, etc., with proper method, with use without distraction, should be considered to have performed the Prāyaścitta of Upavās. Now, the words "Bhikṣu" and "Prāyaścitta" should be connected with each word.

If one does not use the vessel or equipment, then one should perform Upavās. But if one consumes it without transcribing it with proper method, with use without distraction, then one should perform five Upavās. In this way, the first porīsī is completed. If one does not understand the meaning in the second porīsī, then one should perform Purimaḍḍu. If there is a lecture and one does not listen to it, then one is Avandanīya. If there is a lack of lecture, and one does not perform Swādhyāya, such as Vācanā, etc., then one should perform five Upavās.

While doing this, when the time comes, one should perform the Nindana, Garhaṇa, Ālocanā, and Pratikramṇa of any Atichāra that has been committed, as mentioned in the Devasik Atichāra. Even after doing so, if one commits any Atichāra through one's body, speech, mind, Utsūtra, conduct, by conducting oneself in an improper way, by consuming the unpermissible, by performing the unperformable, by having evil thoughts or evil intentions, by consuming misconduct, by conducting oneself in a way that is not worthy of desire, by conducting oneself in a way that is not worthy of a Śramaṇa, for the sake of knowledge, for the sake of vision, for the sake of character, for the sake of Śruta, for the sake of Samāyik, for the three Gupti, for the four Kaṣāya, for the five Mahāvrat, for the six Jīvanikāya, for the seven types of Piṇḍeṣaṇā, etc., for the eight Pravacanamatā,

**Study/Purpose/Sūtrāṅka**

If the refutation and refutation of the nine types of Brahmacharya's secrets, the ten types of Śramaṇa Dharma, etc., and other many elaborate things mentioned in the Āgama has happened, and due to that, the Āgama's skillful such Gītartha Guru has told the atonement, then one should adopt it with full strength, vigor, effort, and courage without hiding it, with a humble mind devoid of deceit, and with twelve types of tapas karma, both external and internal, like fasting, etc., again determining and confirming it with the Guru, and then openly and humbly saying so, and then accepting the atonement tapas given by the Guru, either all at once or in parts, and not doing it properly, then that monk becomes Avandaniya.

**O Bhagavant!** Why should one perform tapas-prāyaścitta by taking breaks in between, i.e., by performing tapas in parts? **O Gautama!** A monk who is not able to perform the six months, four months, or Māsa-kṣamaṇa all at once, should also perform the atonement by fasting for six, eight, four, five, or fifteen days. On the other hand, if any other atonement is included within it, then one should perform tapas-prāyaścitta according to one's ability, taking breaks in between. While doing so, if there is a short time left for the Purimaḍū at midday, and if, while performing Pratikramṇa, Vandana, Svādhyāya, Paribhramaṇa, walking, going, standing, sitting, getting up, there is a touch of the Teūkāya, and the monk does not pull away his limbs, does not stop the collision, then he should not perform the fast, nor should he enter the atonement properly, nor should he perform tapas karma according to his ability, then he should be told to perform four times the atonement the next day. If someone pretends to be performing Vandana or Pratikramṇa, and a snake or cat passes by, then he should not flinch, or he should go to another place. He should be happy in Ugratapas compared to that. If he does not do this, then he should be expelled from the Gaccha.

**A monk who is the cause, creator, or bearer of that great calamity, misfortune, and inauspiciousness, should be considered fit to be expelled from the Gaccha.** If someone wanders here and there in the first or second Porisī, travels, wanders at an inappropriate time, looks for loopholes, and does not perform the four Āhāra-Cōvihāra-Pacchakkhāṇa, then he should be given six days of penance. If he performs the Pratilekhanā of the Sthaṇḍila place during the day and performs the Jayanā in the evening, then he should be given Ekāsana for the Glana, and six days for others. If the Sthaṇḍila place is not checked during the day for living beings, and the Bhajana, Pūjanā-Pramārjana is not done, the place is not seen, and the Bhajana for performing Mātrī is not seen with Jayanā, and at night, he performs Thalla or Mātrī, then he should be given Ekāsana for the Glana, and twelve-five days of fasting for others, or the Glana should be given Micchāmi Dukkadam.

**Similarly, in the first Porisī, leaving the study of the Sūtra, and in the second Porisī, leaving the study of the Artha, if someone talks about women, devotees, countries, kings, thieves, or the five things of householders, or talks about other irrelevant things, or talks about things that arouse Ārta-Raudradhyāna, or makes such a proposal or causes it, then he should be Avandaniya for one year.** If, due to some big reason, there is a reduction of even a moment or half a moment in Svādhyāya in the first or second Porisī, then the Glana should be given Micchāmi Dukkadam. If, due to any reason, someone repeatedly performs Pratikramṇa while sitting, even though the Gītartha Guru has repeatedly forbidden it, then he should be Avandaniya for one month. He should observe Maunavrata for four months. If someone takes food and water before the completion of the first Porisī, and after the completion of the third Porisī, then he should be given Purimaḍū. If he does not use it in front of the Guru, then he should be given Cāuttham. If he takes anything without using it, then he should be given Cāuttham. If he uses it improperly, then he should be given fasting. For food, for water, for acceptance, for the Guru's work, for going out of the land, he should not say the word "Āvassiāe" by colliding his forehead with the Guru's feet, and he should enter the door of his own residence, and he should not say "Nisih", then he should be given Purimaḍḍ. If he goes out of the residence for reasons other than the seven reasons for going out, then he should be expelled from the Gaccha.

Agam Sutra 39, Cheda Sutra-5, 'Mahanisitha'

If one goes out of the path of Raga (attachment), and doubts arise regarding Chedopasthapana, Agitartha or Gitartha, then one should accept Ahara (food), Pani (water), Aushadha (medicine), Vastra (clothes), Danda (staff) etc. in an improper manner, and should not confess before the Guru. This is the breach of the third vow. For one month, one should be Avandaniya (not to be greeted) and observe Maunavrata (vow of silence).

If one enters a village, town, capital, three roads, four roads, crossroads or assembly hall for the purpose of Katha (discourse) or Vikatha (idle talk) regarding Ahara, Pani, Aushadha or one's own or Guru's work, then it is Upasthapana. If one goes there wearing Pag Rakshaka-Upanaha (foot-protectors), then it is Upasthapana. If one accepts Upanaha, then it is Upavasa (fast). If such an occasion arises and one uses Upanaha, then it is Upavasa.

If one goes somewhere, stands there, and someone questions him, then he should reply with politeness and sweetness, only as much as necessary for the work, not arrogant, not contemptuous, blameless, pleasing to the minds of all people, beneficial to this world and the next. If he does not reply in this manner, then it is Avandaniya. If he speaks words that are free of sixteen defects but with caution, then it is Upasthapana. If he speaks more, then it is Upasthapana. If he speaks words with Kashaya (passions), then it is Avandaniya.

If he eats food or stays at night with people who are agitated by Kashaya, then for one month he should observe Maunavrata and Avandaniya Upasthana. If he makes others agitated by Kashaya by giving them the occasion of Kashaya, or increases the Kashaya of one with little Kashaya, or reveals the secret matters of someone, then in all these cases he should be expelled from the Gaccha (monastic order).

If he speaks harsh words, then five Upavasa. If he speaks harsh sounds, then five Upavasa. If he speaks rough, harsh, rigid, cruel, unpleasant words, then it is Upasthapana. If he abuses, then Upavasa. If he causes distress, quarrel, turmoil, fight, then he should be expelled from the Sangha.

If he speaks abusive words with 'Makara', 'Chakara', 'Jakara' etc., then Upavasa. If he does it again, then Avandaniya. If he hits, then expulsion from the Sangha. If he kills, then expulsion from the Sangha. If he digs, breaks, crawls, fights, kindles fire, gets others to cook, then in each case he should be expelled from the Sangha.

Even if he speaks such words in front of the Guru, or in any way belittles the Gacchanayaka, or violates the conduct of the Gaccha or Sangha, or the religious duties of the assembly like Vandana (salutation), Pratikramana (confession) etc., or gives Diksha (initiation) improperly, or gives higher Diksha, or expounds Sutra, Artha or both improperly, or performs Sarana-Varana-Choyani-Parichchhoyani improperly or does not perform them properly, or does not perform Saranadika properly for one going towards the wrong path, or says anything in the presence of the whole world that glorifies his own side, beneficial words, or deeds, then in each case he should be gradually expelled from the Kula (family), Gana (group) and Sangha.

Even after being expelled, if he becomes extremely devoted to the practice of severe austerities, then, O Gautama! he is not worth seeing, therefore one should not stay even for a moment, half a moment, Ghati or half Ghati near him who has been expelled from the Kula, Gana and Sangha.

Without looking with the eyes, i.e. without visually examining the place where he is to be placed, if he touches Thalla, Matri, Balakha, Nasika-Mela, Shleshma, or the body's secretions, and does not clean the joint of the toilet seat while sitting, then he should be given the gradual Nivi and Ayambil Prayaschitta (penances).

If he improperly places, keeps, takes, accepts, or gives any utensil, measure, or any other object like Danda etc. in the unaffected area, then four Ayambil, and in the affected area, Upasthapana. If he uses any equipment necessary for the vows such as upper garment, Rajoharan, Padaponchanika, inner cotton cloth, Cholpatta, Varshakalpa blanket, or Muhapatti, without proper recording, or with improper recording, or in less or more quantity than the scriptural evidence, then in each case Kshapana-Upavasa Prayaschitta.

If he improperly uses the upper garment, Rajoharan, Danda, then Upavasa. If he suddenly places the Rajoharan (like an axe) on a pillar, then Upasthapana. If he gets his body parts massaged or pressed, then Upavasa. If he handles the Rajoharan with disrespect, then Chautham. If a Pramatta (careless) Bhikshu's Muhapatti or any other equipment of the vow is suddenly lost or destroyed, then from Upavasa to Upasthapana, as appropriate, he should search for it diligently, say 'Micchami Dukkadam', and if not found, he should confess, and if found, he should accept it again.

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Chhedasūtra-5, 'Mahānishīth'

If one eats in the absence of the six causes, it is Athuṁ. If one consumes food with Dhūmradoṣa and Angāra doṣa, it is Upasthāpana. If one eats different foods or combinations of flavors to nourish the tongue's taste, it is Āyambil and Bal. Despite having Vīrya, Puruṣakāra, and Parākrama, if one does not drink water after bathing on Aṣṭamī, Caturdaśī, Jñānapāñcamī, or Paryuṣaṇā, it is Cauṭṭh. If one drinks water from a washed vessel, it is Duvālas. If one places a vessel, mātraka, tarpaṇī, or any other utensil without drying it after removing the wetness, and keeps it without cleaning, it is Cothabhakta. If one does not loosen the knot of the Patrabāṇḍh or does not perform its Paḍilehaṇā, it is Cothabhakta. If one washes hands in the food assembly, then walks with the foot touching the water, cleans the place of eating, and does not take the Kāja with a Daṇḍapucchaṇaka, it is Nīvī. If one cleans the place of the food assembly, gathers the Kāja, and does not perform Iriya, it is Nīvī.

Similarly, if one does not reject the remaining day's Tivīhāra or Covīhāra by saying Iriya, it is Āyambil. If one does not perform Pacchakkhāṇa in front of the Guru, it is Purimaḍū. If one performs Pacchakkhāṇa improperly, it is Āyambil. If one does not pay homage to the Caitya and the Sadhu after performing Pacchakkhāṇa, it is Purimaḍū. If one pays homage to a Kuśīla, it is Avandanīya. After that, if one goes out to fetch water on cold ground for the sake of restraint, and returns with great effort, then at that time, a little less than the third Porisī is completed. Even in that, if one performs Iriya, criticizes the proper way of going and coming, and arranges the vessels and utensils like Patra, Mātraka, etc., then the third Porisī is completed properly. In this way, after the third Porisī has passed, O Gautama! The monk who, in front of the Guru, asks for permission to drink water by saying "Sandisāuṁ" according to the rules of Upadhi and Sthaṇḍil, and does not perform Svādhyāya until the time of Kāla, should be considered to have committed the sixth Prāyaścitta.

When the time of Kāla arrives, one should perform Pratiupekshaṇā of the Guru's Upadhi and Sthaṇḍil, Vandana, Pratikramṇa, Sajjhāya, Maṇḍalī, etc., and after that, perform Kāusagg for purification from the daily transgressions with a calm mind, free from distractions. In each of these, one should know the gradual Upasthāpana, Purimaḍḍa, Ekāsana, and Upasthāpana Prāyaścitta. According to this, after performing Kāusagg, one should write down the Muhpattī, perform Kr̥tikarma Vandana to the Guru Mahārāja according to the rules, and from sunrise onwards, in any place, whether sitting, going, walking, roaming, hurrying, or coming into contact with earth, water, fire, air, plants, greenery, grass, seeds, flowers, buds, sprouts, corals, vessels, two, three, four, or five-sensed beings, if one has committed any kind of collision, suffering, Kilamaṇā, or disturbance, and if one has violated the three Gupti, four Kaṣāya, five Mahāvrat, six Jīvanīkāya, seven types of water and food, eight Pravacanamaṭā, nine Brahmacarya Gupti, ten types of Śramaṇadharma, Jñāna, Darśana, and Cāritra, one should perform Nīndā, Garhā, Ālocanā, and Prāyaścitta for that particular transgression. With a focused mind, one should contemplate the meaning of the Sūtra, Artha, and both of them, and if one does not perform Pratikramṇa, it is Upasthāpana. While doing this, the sun sets. If one performs Pratikramṇa without paying homage to the Caitya, it is Cothabhakta.

After performing Pratikramṇa, if one does not perform Svādhyāya in the first Pahora of the night, according to the rules, it is Duvālas. If one asks for permission to perform Santhāra before the first Porisī is completed, according to the rules of Santhāra, it is Chaṭhū. If one performs Santhāra without Sandisā and goes to sleep, it is Cauṭṭh. If one performs Santhāra without Pratiupekshaṇā, it is Duvālas. If one performs Santhāra improperly, it is Cauṭṭh. If one performs Santhāra without Uttarapatṭā, it is Cauṭṭh. If one performs Santhāra on two beds, it is Cauṭṭh. If one performs Santhāra on a bed with space in the middle, a bed with a rope, or a bed that is warm below, it is 100 Āyambil. If one does not forgive all the beings of the entire Śramaṇasaṁgha, all the Sadharmika, and all the living beings of the entire Jīvarāśī, with all kinds of feelings, with Trividha-Trividha, and does not offer them forgiveness, and does not pay homage to the Caitya, and does not perform Pacchakkhāṇa of the Guru's feet, the Upadhi, the body, and the food, and does not put cotton wool in the ear, and sits in Santhāra, then in each case, it is Upasthāpana. After sitting in Santhāra, if one does not protect the Dharma-Śarīra from snakes, lions, wicked beings, light-bodied Vāṇamantra, Piśāca, etc., in the ten directions, with this excellent Mantra-Akṣara obtained from the Guru Paramparā, it is Upasthāpana. If one protects the ten directions and goes to sleep without reciting the twelve Bhavanā, it is 25 Āyambil. One single sleep...

**Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'**

If a monk does not study/understand/complete the sutra number and does not perform self-study until the time of Pratikraman of Iriya Vahi Padikkama, then he should perform 100 Duwalas. If he has a bad dream or nightmare after sleeping, he should perform Kausagg for 100 breaths. If he sneezes or coughs at night, or if his bed, mattress, or pillow shifts or makes a noise, then he should perform Khaman. If he laughs, plays, engages in sexual activity, or speaks disrespectfully during the day or night, then he should perform Upasthapan.

In the same way, if a monk transgresses the sutra and performs an act that is necessary, then O Gautam! he should perform the Pratikraman of Micchami Dukkadam for the cause. If it is without cause, then he should perform the Pratikraman of Chauthth etc. as appropriate. If a monk speaks, causes someone to speak, or makes a loud noise with a deep or shallow voice, then he should perform the Pratikraman in every place, in every position, and in every step, with the appropriate relationship.

According to that, if a monk performs the act of sexual intercourse with a woman, but does not experience pleasure, then he should perform 25 Ayambils. And if he experiences pleasure with a woman, then he should not even look at the face of the one who has the characteristics of Durant Prant. Such a perpetrator of a great sin should perform the Paranchit Pratikraman.

Now, if he is a great ascetic, then he should perform 70 Masakshapan, 100 Adharmmasakshapan, 100 Duwalas, 100 Chaar Upavas, 100 Athum, 100 Chhatth, 100 Upavas, 100 Ayambil, 100 Ekashaan, 100 Shuddha Achaaml, Ekashaan (in which no salt, pepper, or anything else is mixed), 100 Nirvikrutik, and perform the Pratikraman in reverse order. The Pratikraman given should be understood as coming soon for the monk who performs it without any interruption. Sutra-1385

O Bhagvant! If he performs the Pratikraman of every type of penance in this way, according to the number of times, then for how long should he perform it? O Gautam! He should perform it until he is established in that path of conduct. O Bhagvant! What should he do after that? O Gautam! After that, he may or may not perform any penance. Those who continue to perform penance according to what is described further are worthy of respect, worship, and seeing. They are of the highest auspicious form, worthy of being named in the morning. They are worthy of respect in all three realms. Those who do not perform the prescribed penance are sinners. They are great sinners. They are the greatest of sinners. They have the characteristics of Durant Prant Adham. They are not even worthy of being looked at. Sutra-1386-1387

O Gautam! When this Pratikraman Sutra is broken, then the brilliance of the moon, sun, planets, stars, and constellations will not shine for seven days and nights. When it is broken, there will be a lack of all restraint, because this Pratikraman is the destroyer of all sins, the main part of all penance and restraint, and the essence and core of the supreme purity of the sermon. All these Pratikraman steps are described. Sutra-1388

O Gautam! If all these Pratikraman are collected and counted, then the Pratikraman for a Gachchadhipati, the leader of the Gachcha, and the leader of the community of Sadhvis, the Pravartiini, should be four times as much. Because they are aware of all this. And if this Gachcha Nayak, who is familiar with this, becomes negligent, then even if he is strong, energetic, and mostly engaged in the Agam, he should not perform it with such faith. But he should become one who is engaged with a slow enthusiasm. The bodily effort performed by one who has a broken result is useless. For the sake of which this is so, the Tirthankar Bhagvant, who is inconceivable, unique, without attachment, and has a community of merit, even though he experiences such merit, it is not appropriate for a Sadhu to do so. The Gachchadhipati etc. should not be inclined towards any fault. Therefore, it is said that the Gachchadhipati etc., the leaders of the community, should be given four times the amount of all these Pratikraman collected together.

Study/Purpose/Sutra Number - 1389

O Bhagvant! If a Gani, without negligence, does not always take care of the Gachch according to the scriptures, with the correct statement, what is the Paranchit Prāyaśchitta for him? O Gautam! If he does not take care of the Gachch, then it is called Paranchit Prāyaśchitta. O Bhagvant! And then, if any Gani is free from all the supports of negligence, always takes care of the Gachch according to the scriptures, with Saran and other things, and his disciple, who is wicked or of that kind, does not practice the true conduct of the right path, then does the Gani receive Prāyaśchitta? O Gautam! Certainly, such a Guru receives Prāyaśchitta. O Bhagvant! For what reason? O Gautam! Because he has given Pravrajya to the disciple without testing him with virtues and vices. O Bhagvant! Can such a Gani also be given Prāyaśchitta? O Gautam! Such a Gani with such qualities, but when such sinful Gachch, who are not practicing self-benefit, are not purified by the three-fold purification, then they should be expelled from the Sangha. O Bhagvant! When the Gani, the leader of the Gachch, purifies the Gachch with the three-fold purification, can that Gachch be respected? If, after repenting, gaining remorse, consuming the correct Prāyaśchitta, receiving Upasampada in the residence of another Gachchādhipati, and following the right path, he is to be respected. Now, if he remains free-willed in the same way, does not repent, does not gain remorse, then do not respect that Gachch, do not consider it, which is expelled from the four-fold Shraman Sangha. Sutra-1390

O Bhagvant! When the disciple behaves in the correct way of restraint, then some bad Guru, in the form of their initiation, approaches that good disciple, then what is considered the proper duty of the disciple? O Gautam! To practice severe heroic austerity. O Bhagvant! In what way? O Gautam! By entering another Gachch. O Bhagvant! He cannot enter another Gachch without giving up his relationship with his master. Then what should he do? O Gautam! His relationship with his master should be completely erased. O Bhagvant! How can his relationship with his master be completely erased? O Gautam! By writing a letter. O Bhagvant! What are those letters? O Gautam! "I will not accept myself as their disciple or disciple-woman at any time in the future." O Bhagvant! If he does not write such a letter? O Gautam! If he does not write such a letter, then tell the nearby Pravachni, and gather four or five together, and forcefully make him write the letter. O Bhagvant! If even by such force, that bad Guru does not write the letter, then what should he do? O Gautam! If that bad Guru does not write the letter in that way, then advise him to expel him from the Sangha. O Bhagvant! Why should he say this?

O Gautam! In this world, the stake of the house and family, in the form of a great noose, is stuck on the neck. With great difficulty, breaking that stake, born from many physical and mental pains, terrified by the pain of the world in the form of the speed of the arrow, somehow, by the effect of the destruction of attachment and false belief, etc., attaining the right path, rising above the enjoyment of desires, gaining detachment, if his tradition does not continue, he earns such unattached merit. That merit is earned through the practice of austerity and restraint. If the Guru himself becomes an obstacle in the practice of his austerity and restraint, or causes obstacles and hindrances for others, if he considers the obstacle-maker to be good and approves of him, if he ignores the obstacle, whether from his own side or from the other side, that is, if he does not stop him with his own power, then the existing Dharmavirya of such a virtuous Sadhu is destroyed. As much as the Dharmavirya is destroyed, so much is the merit of the one who was going to come forward destroyed. If he abandons the Shramanlinga, then, being of such qualities, he abandons that Gachch and goes to another Gachch. Even then, if he cannot enter, then perhaps he will abandon his life unlawfully, perhaps he will attain false belief and join other deceivers, perhaps he will enter the household life by collecting women, such a great ascetic was now an un-ascetic, becoming a servant working in another's house. Until such a light arrangement is made, the darkness of solitary false belief will increase. As much as false belief increases, so much will the community of such people increase.

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

The Dharma of a Shraman, marked by non-violence, which eliminates misfortune and brings about a lineage of happiness, is difficult to practice. When it is practiced, the severance of the Tirtha occurs, and the distance to the ultimate liberation, the Parampad, increases significantly. The path to attaining the Parampad becomes distant, and therefore, a group of such Bhavyatmas, filled with sorrow, will be trapped in the cycle of the four gatis (states of existence). For this reason, O Gautam! It is said that such a Kuguuru (bad teacher) should not be given the Akshar (sacred syllable), and the Sangha should be advised to expel him. Sutra-1391

O Bhagvant! After how much time will such Kuguurus appear on this path? O Gautam! From today, after 1250 years, a little more than that, such Kuguurus will appear. O Bhagvant! What will be the reason for their appearance as Kuguurus? O Gautam! At that time, those who practice the three Garvas (pride) of Riddhi (power), Ras (taste), and Shaata (peace), and whose inner soul and body are burning with the fire of Mamta (attachment) and Ahankar (ego), will become Acharya Gachchhayaks, not knowing the true essence of the Shastra, believing that they have done this work, that they have influenced the Shasana. Because of this, they will be called Kuguurus. O Bhagvant! Will all the Gachchhayaks at that time be of this kind? O Gautam! Not all of them will be like that. Some will be of the Durant Praant (extreme) type, despicable, unworthy of being seen, born as twins from the same mother, devoid of restraint, naturally inclined to sin, engaging in evil deeds throughout their lives, adopting the false views of Jaati (caste), Raudra (fierce), Prachand (intense), and Abhigarahik (greedy). How will they be recognized? They will be recognized by their actions, such as giving advice that leads to the wrong path, or giving permission for such actions. Sutra-1392

O Bhagvant! Will the Acharya Gachchhayaks also be negligent in their essential duties? O Gautam! Consider it as Avandaniya (unworthy of respect) if a Gachchhayak is negligent for even a moment without any reason. Those who are not negligent in their essential duties even for a moment, despite the presence of great reasons, should be considered Vandaniya (worthy of respect), Pujaniya (worthy of worship), Darshaniya (worthy of seeing), and equal to the Siddha Buddhas who have attained the state of Kshina (diminished) karma, free from the dust of karma. The rest will be explained in detail in its respective place. Sutra-1393

According to this, those who, after hearing the method of Prāyaścitta (atonement), do not practice the proper rituals for consuming the doshas (faults) with a mind devoid of humility, and who put in as much effort as is required in the place where it is needed, are called Aradhak Atma (worshipping soul). Sutra-1394-1395

In times of fear from water, fire, wild animals that tear flesh, thieves, kings, snakes, Yoginis, ghosts, Yakshas, Rakshasas, Kshatras, Pisachas, death, disease, pain, obstacles, hindrances, livelihood, forests, the sea, evil thoughts, bad omens, etc., remember this Vidya (knowledge).

(This Vidya is in the form of Mantra-Akshar (sacred syllables). The Mantra-Akshar cannot be translated. For the original Mantra-Akshar, refer to our Agam Suttanni, Part-39, Mahanishith Agam, page 120.) Sutra-1396

By properly chanting this excellent Vidya, one should chant it and establish it in seven places: one head, two arms, the abdomen, and the soles of the feet, using seven Aksharas (syllables) as follows: "Om" on the head, "Ku" on the right shoulder, "Ru" on the right abdomen, "Ku" on the right sole, "Le" on the left sole, "Swa" on the left abdomen, and "Ha" on the left shoulder.

Fear of nightmares, bad omens, planetary afflictions, obstacles, enemies, or misfortune, excessive rainfall, drought, lightning, meteor showers, bad winds, fire, opposition from influential people, and all other fears that arise in this world, are destroyed by the influence of this knowledge. One who desires to perform atonement that brings auspiciousness, removes sins, and bestows all other inexhaustible happiness, even if they may not attain Siddhi in that life, will still attain the excellent Deva-Gati of the Vāimānika, be born in a good family, and suddenly attain Samyaktvā, experiencing the bliss of the lineage, and being forever freed from the bondage of the eight karmas, the dust and impurities, and attain Siddhi. Sūtra - 1400

_O Bhagvant! Is this the only atonement ordinance that is prescribed according to this? O Gautama! This is the general atonement prescribed for all beings, from the very young to the very old, newly initiated, calculators, those with abundant wealth, and so on, including the Muni-gaṇas, and even for those who are not yet fully enlightened, those who are Mahā-Avadhi, Manah-paryavagyanī, Chhadmastha Vītarāga, such Bhikshus, in relation to the necessary actions of solitary awakening yoga. But do not think that this is the only atonement. O Bhagvant! Should those who are not fully enlightened, Mahā-Avadhi, Manah-paryavagyanī, Chhadmastha Vītarāga, perform all the necessary actions? O Gautama! They should definitely perform them. Not only the necessary actions alone, but they should always perform all the necessary actions continuously. O Bhagvant! How should they perform them? O Gautama! They should perform them with the strength of inconceivable power, vigor, intelligence, superior knowledge, and ability. O Bhagvant! Why should they perform them? O Gautama! Even if there is no instigation or instigation from the Utsūtra Unmārga, they should perform the necessary actions by doing so. Sūtra - 1401

O Bhagvant! Why don't you tell us about a specific type of atonement? O Gautama! For violating the rules of the Gaccha-āchāra regarding travel and dwelling during the rainy season, for transgressing the rules of the Sangh-āchāra, for revealing a secret, for transgressing the Dharma of the seven types of Maṇḍalī, for engaging in conduct like bowing, offering food, etc., with a Kuśīla who has gone to a Gaccha that is not mentioned in the scriptures, for giving improper ordination or for giving the great initiation to someone who is not eligible, for exceeding the limits of the Sūtra-artha, for exceeding the limits of both the Sūtra-artha and its meaning, for giving a single letter in ignorance, for committing offenses related to the daily, nightly, fortnightly, monthly, four-monthly, yearly, light-related, otherworldly, diagnosed, for contradicting the fundamental qualities, for contradicting the secondary qualities, for committing offenses knowingly or unknowingly, for repeatedly consuming offenses with cruelty, for consuming offenses with carelessness and pride, for consuming offenses due to exceptions to the commands, for experiencing Roudra-ārta-dhyāna during Mahāvrata, Śramaṇa-dharma, Samyama, Tapa, Niyama, and times of difficulty, for experiencing offenses related to Rāga, Dvesha, Moha, Mithyātva, for experiencing offenses related to evil, cruelty, and consequences, for experiencing offenses related to ego, fainting, and attachment arising from the beginning, for not following the Samiti, for sleeping in the absence of someone else, for experiencing offenses related to enmity, anger, anxiety, and mental unrest, for experiencing offenses related to speaking falsehoods, for accepting things without giving, for experiencing offenses related to sexual intercourse, for experiencing offenses related to the three types of karma, for experiencing offenses related to attachment, for experiencing offenses related to eating at night, for experiencing offenses related to mental, verbal, and physical misconduct, for experiencing offenses related to committing, causing, and allowing misconduct, for experiencing offenses related to knowledge, vision, and character, for experiencing offenses related to sinful actions, what more can be said? As many as there are places and forms of atonement like Trikāla-Chaityavandana, etc., so many are specifically prescribed.

O Gautama! Countless numbers of prescriptions are given. Therefore, one should understand well that O Gautama! The Sūtra-artha, the number, the proof, the appointment, the collection, the Anuyoga, the Dwāra, the Akshara, the Ananta-paryāya, have been explained, taught, said, understood, and exemplified, either in terms of time, acquisition, or in terms of sequence or non-sequence, i.e.

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

**Sutra-1402**
There are penances for study/purpose/Sutra number sequential or non-sequential as per the merit.

**O Bhagvant!** You have mentioned many types of penances. There is a conflict in these penances, O Bhagvant! Is there anyone who would accept such penances, who would criticize, condemn, confess, and perform penance as per the merit, and then worship the Shramanya, worship the teachings, and accept it for self-benefit, and worship his own work, and achieve his own work?

**O Gautam!** Understand the four types of criticism. Name criticism, establishment criticism, substance criticism, and feeling criticism. These four terms are explained in many ways and in four ways, in which, in brief, name criticism is understood only by name. Establishment criticism is written in books, etc. In substance criticism, the penance is explained in a simple way, but it is not done accordingly. These three terms, O Gautam!, are not commendable.

**O Gautam!** The fourth term, which is called feeling criticism, is to criticize the existing fault, to make a true request to the Guru, to condemn, to confess, to perform penance, to accept it for self-benefit, and to worship the ultimate meaning of the soul for the ultimate benefit of the soul. This is called feeling criticism.

**O Bhagvant!** What is feeling criticism?

**O Gautam!** The monk who has attained such feeling and detachment, who is a recluse in the worship of the four skandhas of good Shraman Dharma, namely, conduct, penance, charity, and feeling, who is completely free from the faults of pride, fear, arrogance, etc., who is free from all feelings and other feelings, who criticizes all sins, who attains purity, who says 'Tahatti' before criticizing, who performs penance well, and who follows the practice of restraint properly, is of this type.

**Sutra-1403**

**Sutra-1404-1407**
The soul that is beneficial does not even bind small sins. Their purity comes from the words of Tirthankara Bhagvant.

**Sutra-1408-1411**
How will we be purified? By abandoning the sinful actions that cause suffering in the terrible world, I will bear the burden of conduct through the actions of mind, speech, and body. Just as all Bhagvants, Kevalis, Tirthankaras, virtuous Acharyas, Upadhyayas, and Sadhus, and then just as the five Lokapalas, who are familiar with the Dharma of beings, I will not hide any sin, even as small as a grain of sand, in front of them. In the same way, I will criticize all my faults. Even if it is as heavy as a mountain, but can be attained through penance, I will perform it, so that the sin melts away immediately and I can be purified.

**Sutra-1412-1413**
Without performing penance, the soul dies in the next life and goes to hell, to the animal realm, to the Kumhipacak, to the Karvat, where it is cut from both sides, to the Shuli, where it is pierced, to the earth, where it is dragged on thorns and pebbles with a rope tied to its feet, to the standing position, to the piercing and breaking of the body, and then to the binding with ropes, chains, and shackles. Sometimes, one has to cross a waterless forest. Sometimes, one has to endure oppression in the form of a bull, horse, donkey, etc. Sometimes, one has to endure the burning of red-hot iron. Sometimes, one has to be led by a nose ring in the form of a camel or bull. Sometimes, one has to carry heavy loads. Sometimes, one has to carry loads beyond one's strength. Sometimes, one has to be pierced with a sharp arrow. And then, the chest, back, bones, and waist are broken. One has to endure thirst and hunger due to helplessness. One has to endure suffering, anxiety, poverty, etc. again.

**_So, in return, I will reveal my entire bad character, as I have performed it._**

I will criticize, condemn, and censure in the presence of the Guru, and by taking Prāyaścitta, I will burn and destroy the sinful karma that causes suffering in the world, through intense penance, with fortitude, courage, and valor. Sūtra - 1414-1415

I will practice that intense, very intense penance, which is difficult and painful, with great effort, as it is the cause of all welfare, as taught by Jinendra, with respect, even if it dries up my body while standing. Sūtra - 1416-1418

I will restrain my mind, speech, and body, by controlling the beginning of the flow of karma and the doors of inflow, by abandoning ego, pride, and anger, free from attachment, aversion, delusion, association, possessions, and possessiveness, with detachment even towards my body, I will observe the five great vows. And I will certainly not allow any transgression in them. Sūtra - 1419-1422

Alas, I am cursed! Indeed, I am unworthy! I am a sinner and a sinner in thought! I am a sinner who commits sinful acts! I am the lowest of the low, a great sinner! I am a wicked, corrupt character, worthy of being compared to a hunter and a butcher! I am a Chandala, a cruel, merciless sinner, a doer of cruel deeds, and I am worthy of condemnation! Having obtained such a rare character, I will not criticize, condemn, censure, and take Prāyaścitta, by contradicting knowledge, vision, and conduct, and perhaps I will die with a faithless devotion, then I will surely sink into the depths of the immeasurable, terrifying ocean of existence, from which I will not be able to emerge even after millions of births. Sūtra - 1423-1425

So, until I am afflicted by old age, and then I am afflicted by some disease, until my senses are sound, I will practice Dharma. I will condemn and censure the sinful karma committed in the past, for a long time, and burn it to ashes. By taking Prāyaścitta, I will become free from blemishes. O Gautama! I will accept any difficult Prāyaścitta, before those pure, spotless, and unblemished feelings are destroyed. Sūtra - 1426-1429

Thus, by expressing criticism and taking Prāyaścitta, becoming completely free from suffering and karmic impurities, perhaps they will not attain liberation in that moment or in that birth, but they will go to a heavenly abode, a celestial realm, adorned with hundreds of Apsaras, with the sweet sound of the self-illuminating, eternally radiant, divine drum, Devadundubhi. From there, they will return here, born into a noble family, and after indulging in worldly pleasures, they will attain dispassion, practice penance, and then attain the state of a learned sage, and reside in an incomparable celestial chariot, and coming here, they will become the Dharma-Tīrthankaras, the equals of all beings in the three realms. Sūtra - 1430

O Gautama! The name of this fourth stage, which is well-established, is Ālocanā, the feeling that gives liberation, the state of imperishable happiness. Thus I say. Sūtra - 1431-1432

O Bhagavant! Having attained such a noble, excellent, and pure stage, if someone, due to carelessness, repeatedly makes a mistake, errs, or slips in some matter, then is there a purification stage, a stage of purity, that is sufficient for them? Please resolve this doubt. Sūtra - 1433-1435

O Gautama! If someone, after condemning and censuring sin for a long time, and taking Prāyaścitta, does not then protect their great vows, etc., then it is like not carefully protecting a washed garment, and it gets stained.

Even though the material for the destruction of all karma may be found by chance, it is considered very difficult to uproot the inauspicious karma. Sutra-1436-1438

According to that, after performing atonement, if someone breaks any of the six Jivnikaya vows, rules, vision, knowledge, or the limbs of character or conduct, due to anger, pride, delusion, greed, etc., the faults of kshaya, fear, lust, or arrogance, or due to other reasons, arrogance, or by taking unnecessary support, which breaks the vows, etc., consumes the fault, they reach the plane of Sarvarth Siddhi and cause their soul to fall into hell. Sutra-1439

O Bhagvant! What protects the soul, what protects the restraint of the six Jivnikaya? O Gautam! Whoever protects the restraint of the six Jivnikaya, protects the soul from the torment of endless suffering, the path of hell, and the obstruction. Therefore, protecting the six Jivnikaya is considered the protection of the soul. O Bhagvant! How many places of unrestraint are there for the soul? Sutra-1440

O Gautam! There are many places of unrestraint. For example, the places of unrestraint related to the stationary beings like the Earth-bodied, etc. O Bhagvant! How many places of unrestraint are there for the body? O Gautam, the places of unrestraint for the body are of many types. They are as follows: Sutra-1441-1443

Touching the Earth, water, fire, air, plants, and different types of Tris जीव with the hand, abstaining from it for the rest of life, mixing the Earth-bodied beings with cold, hot, sour things, digging the Earth, fire, iron, thorns, sour, slippery, oily things, considering them as weapons that destroy and kill the Earth-bodied beings, etc. Many Apkay जीव are destroyed while bathing by applying mud, etc., on the body, while washing the face to enhance beauty, while cleaning the hands, fingers, eyes, etc., while drinking. Sutra-1444-1445

The community of Agni-bodied beings is destroyed by burning, igniting, illuminating, eating wind, blowing, compressing, etc. If the fire burns well, it consumes things in all ten directions. Sutra-1446

Due to fanning with leaves of Vijn, palm, etc., waving a chamara, beating a drum with the hand, running, jumping, crossing, breathing, keeping, etc., the Vayu-bodied beings are harmed and destroyed. Sutra-1447-1448

The Vanaspati-bodied beings are destroyed by the touch of the hand, such as sprouts, seeds, buds, corals, flowers, roots, leaves, etc. The Tris जीव with two, three, four, and five senses are certainly destroyed and die due to disuse and excessive movement, walking, coming and going, sitting and getting up, sleeping and waking. Sutra-1449

The restraint from violence against living beings is the fruit of liberation. The wise, having accepted such restraint, do not break it even if a death-like calamity arises.

Having become free from the affliction, worthy of performing prāyaścitta by Āloyanā, censure, and reproach, residing in a good place, avoid the beginning of the Earth-bodied, do not touch fire, having become free from the affliction by performing Āloyanā, etc., prāyaścitta, being compassionate,
Residing in a good place, the monk should not cause pain to the shelterless beings, having become compassionate by performing Āloyanā, etc., the monk should not touch a broken straw or a plant, even casually, repeatedly.
Having become free from the affliction by performing prāyaścitta of censure, reproach, and reproach for the existing fault, being compassionate, the monk residing in a good place of restraint should not cause affliction, torment, disturbance, etc., to the two, three, four, or five-sensed beings until the end of life. The householder, having become compassionate after performing Āloyanā, etc., does not even take the ashes thrown up for amusement. Sūtra - 1471-1474
O Gautama! Where will the compassionate, affliction-free soul attain purity if he converses with a woman? The monk, having become compassionate after performing Āloyanā, etc., does not possess any instrument other than the fourteen. He should be firm, ruthless, unwavering, and unattached to the instruments that are the means of restraint. O Gautama! If he becomes possessive of the object, he will not be purified. What more can I say? Where will the one who drinks water at night after performing Āloyanā in this matter attain purity?

If a monk, who has performed atonement for criticism, slander, and reproach, and is free from blemishes, does not protect the first vow, then he has committed a transgression with an unrefined attitude, which will have terrible consequences. If he has violated the second great vow, called *Mrishavaad* and *Viraman*, by speaking harsh, cruel, and severe words with intense attachment or aversion, or if he has violated the third great vow, called *Adattadaan Viraman*, by consuming something without the owner's permission or by accepting an unwanted gift, with an unrefined attitude of attachment or aversion, or if he has violated the fourth great vow, called *Maithun Viraman*, by transgressing in the realm of words, taste, smell, touch, and thought, or if he has violated the fifth great vow, called *Parigraha Viraman*, by having a desire to obtain, by begging, by fainting, by seeking purification, or by grieving over a lost object, which are all forms of greed and anger, then he has committed a transgression in the fifth vow. If he has consumed more food during the day, thinking that he will be hungry at night, or if he has consumed food despite the doubt of sunrise or sunset, then he has committed a transgression in the *Ratri Bhojan Viraman* vow. If a monk, who has performed atonement for criticism, slander, and reproach, and is free from blemishes, does not understand *Jayana*, then he is like a *Sushad* who wanders in the cycle of birth and death. Sutra - 1483

O *Gavant*, who was that *Sushad*? What kind of *Jayana* was it, or why did his world not end despite performing atonement for criticism, slander, and reproach due to ignorance? O *Gautam*, *Jayana* is the one who, even when faced with great calamities like a deserted forest, lack of water, famine, or disease, with only a moment left to live, and with the breath stuck in their throat, does not mentally abandon their vows. They do not oppose, do not cause others to oppose, and do not approve of opposition. They do not initiate or cause others to initiate any action until the end of their life. Those who know and practice this complete *Jayana* are devotees of *Jayana*, they are steadfast in *Jayana*, they are skilled in *Jayana*, and they are familiar with *Jayana*. There is a very amazing and great story about this *Sushad*.

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Chhedasūtra-5, 'Mahānishīth'
Study/Purpose/Sūtrāṅka Study-8- (Chūlikā-2) Susṛḍha Kathā Sūtra-1484

O Bhagvant! Why is this said? At that time, there was a person named Susṛḍha here. He criticized many Asanyama Sthānaka within a single day and performed a great, severe, and difficult Prāyaśchitta. Still, he did not attain purity. This is why it is said.

O Bhagvant! What was the story of Susṛḍha?

O Gautam! In this Bharatvarsha, there is a country called Avanti. There was a small village called Sambhukk. In that village, there was a Brahmin named Sujñaśiva, who was born poor, without any sense of propriety, without grace, miserly, without compassion, extremely cruel, merciless, with a fierce nature, difficult, learned, a greedy, wrong-sighted person, whose name itself is a sin. Sujñaśrī was his daughter. Her beauty, radiance, and splendor were unparalleled and superior to the beauty, radiance, and splendor of all men and women in the three worlds. Sujñaśrī had a wicked thought for the next life: "If this child's mother dies, it would be good. I will be free from sorrow. Then, this child will live in sorrow. And royal fortune will be obtained by my son." As a result of this wicked thought, she was born with the karmic defect, and her mother died immediately after her birth. After that, O Gautam! Sujñaśiva, her father, begged with great distress. He went from house to house, worshipping mothers who gave birth to new children. His daughter grew up. Then, a terrible famine, lasting twelve years, came, which separated mother and son. When the entire population left, abandoning their relatives, one day, Sujñaśiva, hungry for many days and filled with sorrow, thought, "Should I kill this child and satisfy my hunger? Or should I sell her flesh to a merchant and buy food to save my life? There is no other way to survive. Or, I am truly cursed. It is not right to do this. But, I should sell her alive." Thinking this, he sold Sujñaśrī to a Brahmin named Govinda, who was a master of fourteen Vidya Sthāna, and had great wealth. Therefore, Sujñaśiva, wounded by the words of hatred from many people, left his country and went to another land. There, he also kidnapped another girl, sold her, and earned a lot of wealth.

During that time, eight years of the famine passed. Then, all the wealth of Govinda, the Seth, was destroyed. O Gautam! Due to the loss of wealth, Govinda, the Brahmin, was filled with sorrow and thought, "Now, the time of destruction for my family is near. I am not able to see my beloved wife even for a moment. What should I do now?" Thinking this, a cowherd's wife came to sell food. The Brahmin's wife bought four laddoos made of ghee and sugar, measured by a cowherd's measure. As soon as she bought them, the children ate them. The cowherd's wife said, "O Sethani! Give us the cowherd's measure in return. We have to reach Gokul soon." O Gautam! After that, the Brahmin woman ordered Sujñaśrī, "Go quickly and find the cowherd's pot that was sent by the king, so that we can give it to the cowherd." Sujñaśrī went inside to search, but she did not see the pot of rice. The Brahmin woman said, "It's not there." Then, the Brahmin woman said, "Go and look in the upper part of the pot and find it." She went to the courtyard to look again, but she did not see it. Then, the Brahmin woman herself went there to look, but she also did not find the pot. Filled with great wonder, she started looking everywhere. She saw her elder son eating rice with a prostitute in a secluded place. Her son also looked at her. Seeing her mother coming towards him, he was ashamed.

Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, ‘Mahanishith’

The son, thinking to himself, “My mother usually comes to take our rice. If she comes near, I will kill her,” thought this and stayed away. When the Brahmin mother came near, he said to her in harsh words, “O Bhattidarika! If you come here, then don’t say that I didn’t warn you. I will surely kill you.” Hearing these inauspicious words, she fell to the ground as if struck by a meteor. The Brahmin woman did not come back from outside due to fainting, so after waiting for a while, the Mahhiyari said to Sujnasri, “Oh girl! We are getting late, so tell your mother to give us the Dhangar’s Pala. If the Dhangar’s Pala is not seen or found, then give us the Mug’s Pala instead.” Then Sujnasri went to the granary where the grain was kept and seeing the Brahmin woman in another state, she cried out in alarm. Hearing this, the family, including Govind Brahmin and Mahhiyari, arrived. After being reassured by the wind and water, they asked, “O Bhattidarika! What happened to you suddenly?”

Then the Brahmin woman, becoming cautious, replied, “Oh! Don’t make me suffer the bite of a poisonous snake, you who are without protection. Don’t make me stand in a river without water. Oh, don’t establish me in attachment, bound by a rope-less bond of affection, like this son, daughter, nephew, daughter-in-law, son-in-law, mother, father, my husband, my beloved family, relatives, friends, and relatives. They are all here, directly, false, illusory. The hope of kinship from them is a mirage, a false delusion of closeness; if considered from the point of view of ultimate reality, there are no true relatives. As long as their self-interest is fulfilled, they maintain the relationships of mother, father, daughter, son, son-in-law, nephew, daughter-in-law, etc. Until then, everyone likes it. Beloved, dear, affectionate family members, relatives, friends, and relatives maintain relationships only as long as everyone’s own purpose is fulfilled.

In the accomplishment of one’s own work, in separation, no one is anyone’s mother, no one is anyone’s father, no one is anyone’s daughter, no one is anyone’s son-in-law, no one is anyone’s son, no one is anyone’s wife, no one is anyone’s husband, no one is anyone’s master, no one is anyone’s beloved, dear, affectionate family, relatives, friends, and relatives. Because, see, then, after being conceived for nine years, she was nourished with many sweet, delicious, hot, spicy, dry, and oily foods, bathed, clothed, massaged, given wealth and grain, and great efforts were made to bring her up. At that time, there was hope that my desires would be fulfilled in my son’s kingdom. And I thought that I would spend my time in great happiness by fulfilling the hopes of my loved ones. The reality has turned out to be completely opposite to what I thought. Now, after knowing and understanding this, it is not appropriate to have even a moment’s affection for the husband, etc. As the story of my son has been, so has the story been in every household in the past. It is happening in the present and will continue to happen in the future. Those relatives also serve only for the time and affection that is necessary to accomplish their own work. Therefore, O people! I have no use for these artificial relatives and children who cause great suffering in the endless world. Therefore, now, day and night, always serve Dharma with the best and purest intention.

Dharma is wealth, beloved, dear, ultimate good, relatives, friends, and relatives. Dharma is the one who makes one beautiful to behold, strengthens, and gives strength. Dharma is the one who inspires, purifies, and cultivates fame and glory. Dharma is the one who influences and gives the tradition of the highest happiness. That is Dharma. Dharma is the embodiment of all treasures. It is worthy of worship, nourishment, and protection. It is to be done, practiced, served, taught, spoken, read, modeled, and made to happen. Dharma is firm, inexhaustible, and permanent. It is the storehouse of all happiness. Dharma is unashamed. Dharma gives unparalleled strength, vigor, complete essence, courage, and togetherness. It is the one who brings together the best, the best, the beloved, the dear, the beloved, and the visionaries.

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Chhedasūtra-5, 'Mahānishīth'

The Dharma is that which destroys all suffering, poverty, distress, anxiety, disgrace, false accusations, old age, death, and all fear completely. There is no other helper like it, no other unmatched lord in the three realms.

Therefore, family, relatives, friends, kin, wealth, and other worldly things are no longer of use. And this wealth and prosperity is more fickle than a rainbow, lightning, or a pile of clothes. It is like a dream or Indra's water, fleeting and disappearing in an instant. It is perishable, impermanent, and unsustainable. It perpetuates the cycle of existence, obstructs the path to liberation, and brings endless suffering.

Oh people! This time for Dharma is extremely rare. Such a time, filled with the unparalleled material for practicing Dharma, for cultivating right faith, knowledge, and conduct, will not come again. And this body, which we have received, is decaying piece by piece, every moment, day and night. It is becoming weaker every day. It is like a worn-out earthen pot, broken into hundreds of pieces by the impact of a hard stone, useless for any purpose. It has become completely worthless, like a drop of water on a new sprout, suddenly disappearing like a bird flying away from a living tree. This human birth is fruitless for those who do not earn merit for the afterlife. Therefore, I am not capable of even the slightest negligence.

One should be equal in their attitude towards friends and enemies in this human form. One should abstain from all three types of violence against all living beings, speak truthfully, and not accept even the smallest thing without giving something in return, like a toothpick or ashes. One should practice the supreme, pure, and unwavering vow of celibacy, with the complete integration of mind, speech, and body, and with unwavering, newly acquired non-violence. One should be ruthless towards clothes, utensils, and instruments of restraint. One should abstain from food and drink at night, be free from the five defects of origin, production, desire, etc., eat within a limited time, purify the five senses, cultivate the three types of meditation, and practice the austerities of fasting, etc. One should follow the twelve precepts of the monk, avoid acquiring various types of material possessions, bathing, sleeping on the ground, cutting hair, and rubbing the body. One should always behave according to the Guru's instructions. One should endure hunger, thirst, and other hardships. One should conquer divine and other afflictions. One should remain equanimous in both receiving and not receiving. If one receives, one should think of it as an increase in Dharma, and if one does not receive, one should think of it as an increase in austerity.

How much more can I say? Oh people! This is a very difficult path, worthy of carrying the burden of eighteen thousand sheelangs without rest, like a great soul. It is like swimming across the ocean without respite. This virtuous Dharma is like eating tasteless clay. It is like walking on the sharp edge of a terrifying sword. The Dharma of conduct is like drinking the flames of a fire well-nourished with ghee. The difficult Dharma of restraint is like filling a container with a subtle breeze. It is more difficult than walking against the flow of the Ganges, measuring Mount Meru with a scale of courage, conquering a formidable army of four divisions with the strength of a single human being, tying the right eye of a puppet that is moving in the opposite direction of eight moons, or achieving victory in all three realms and receiving the flag of pure fame and glory. It is the most difficult of all things, and through it, all things are achieved. Sūtra-1485-1487

The burden on the head is carried with rest. The burden of great conduct is carried without rest, throughout life. Therefore, abandoning the affection for material possessions, children, etc., become detached, and serve the supreme Dharma of conduct without regret. There is no hypocrisy, false praise, deception, or such behavior in Dharma. It is Dharma free from the thorns of illusion and deceit.

Study/Purpose/Sutra Number Sutra-1488-1496
In a being, there is suffering, and within suffering, the five senses are the most prominent. Among the five senses, humanity is the best. In humanity, the Aryan land is the best, and within the Aryan land, the best family is the best, and within the best family, the best caste and lineage are the best, and then within that, the abundance of beauty, and within that, the dominant power, the dominant strength, along with a long life, and within that, knowledge and wisdom, and within knowledge, right faith is the most important. And then, within right faith, the attainment of virtue is considered excellent. In virtue, the absence of passions, and within the absence of passions, the attainment of pure knowledge, the attainment of perfect pure knowledge, means the attainment of liberation, free from old age and death.
A being bound by the suffering of birth, old age, and death, does not find happiness anywhere in this world. Therefore, liberation alone is worthy of being taught. After wandering through 84 lakh species for an infinite number of times and for a long time, you have now obtained enough things to be worthy of attaining that liberation. If you have obtained such excellent things today that you have never obtained before, then, O people! You should quickly strive for it. Abandon this affection that increases the tradition of the condemned world, as preached by the wise. If you do not practice this beautiful Dharma properly here, then the attainment of that Dharma will be difficult. What value will the attainment of enlightenment have in the future life for someone who does not practice Dharma here according to the attained enlightenment and prays to practice Dharma in the future life? Sutra - 1497
When this was heard from the Brahmin woman due to the recollection of her previous birth, O Gautam! The entire family and many other citizens were awakened.
O Gautam! On that occasion, the path of salvation was found well. In the same way, Govinda Brahmin said, "Shame on me, for so long we have been pretending, we have been fools, ignorance is truly a great suffering. It is very difficult for those who do not know the terrible, fierce, otherworldly causes of the insignificant, insignificant soul, who have a mind that is attached to others, who are motivated to incite the fire of attachment to partiality, who have a mind that is killed by attachment and aversion, and who have these other faults, to understand this excellent Dharma. Truly, my soul has been pretending for so long. This great soul was born in my house under the guise of being a wife. But, if you think about it carefully, she has manifested herself to dispel this darkness of doubt, to illuminate the world, and to show the great path properly, just like the omniscient Acharya. Oh, the words of my beloved, who strives for the attainment of the most excellent meaning. Oh, Yajnadatt! Vishnudatt! Yajnadeva! Vishvamitra! Soma! Aditya, etc., my sons, along with the gods and demons, the entire world, your mother is worthy of your respect and reverence.
Oh! Parandar, etc., students! Think about the words spoken by the wife of this Upadhyaya, who has given joy to the three worlds, who has the nature to burn and incinerate all evil deeds. The Guru is pleased with you today because you have an extraordinary nature in worshipping the Guru. The Guru is pleased with you because you have a strong mind, a desire to study and teach for the purpose of performing sacrifices, and a desire to perform the six karmas. So now, quickly conquer your five senses. Abandon such sinful, angry passions. Understand how you obtain the state of birth, old age, and death, from the womb, which is filled with mud, excrement, impurities, and urine, etc. Such excellent words were spoken, which aroused great dispassion, and after listening to them, many virtuous people, who were afraid of birth, old age, and death, began to think about Dharma. Then, some people started saying, "This Dharma is excellent, it is the best Dharma." Others also started saying the same. O Gautam! Everyone considered this Brahmin woman to be a witness to the fact that she remembers her caste.
After that, the Brahmin woman explained the ten types of Shraman Dharma, such as non-violence, forgiveness, etc., with examples and illustrations, so that they would develop supreme faith. After that, considering that Brahmin woman to be omniscient, they respectfully offered her a beautiful offering of folded hands and bowed down to her. O Gautam! The Brahmin woman's...

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

Many men and women, with minds free from greed, who were content with a short-lived happiness in their families, relatives, friends, kin, homes, wealth, etc., renounced them all, and with a firm and resolute mind, desiring the eternal bliss of liberation, embraced the path of a Shraman. They adopted all the qualities of a Shraman, became a fourteen-preceptor, attained the ultimate body, and were destined for liberation. Such a Ganadhar Sthavir, with a firm and resolute mind, desiring the eternal bliss of liberation, renounced all worldly possessions and embraced the path of a Shraman. He adopted all the qualities of a Shraman, became a fourteen-preceptor, attained the ultimate body, and was destined for liberation. Such a Ganadhar Sthavir approached a Shraman and accepted the vows of Pravrajya.

O Gautam! Thus, they engaged in intense austerities, heroic practices, and the observance of vows, self-study, meditation, etc., and by destroying all their karmas, they attained liberation along with that Brahmani, casting off the dust of karma. Many men and women, including Govinda Brahmana, attained liberation. They all became highly renowned. Thus, I say. Sutra - 1498

O Bhagvant! What did that Brahmani do that she attained such easy enlightenment, became worthy of receiving the name in the morning, and then, through her teachings, liberated many noble beings, men and women, who were rotting in the intense suffering of the endless cycle of birth and death, giving them eternal happiness through beautiful Dharmadesha, etc.? O Gautam! In her previous birth, she had performed atonement with pure intentions, free from any malice, for the faults she had accumulated from birth to eternity, with beautiful intentions. She then attained Samadhi and, due to its influence, was born in the Saudharma Devaloka as the chief queen, Mahadevi, of Indra Maharaj.

O Bhagvant! Was the soul of that Brahmani a Nigranthi Shramani in her previous birth, who performed atonement with pure intentions, free from any malice? O Gautam! The soul of that Brahmani had attained great wealth and liberation in her previous birth. She had attained the great wealth of knowledge, vision, and character. She was the head of the Anagar Gachchha, a great ascetic, the leader of her time, with a body adorned with the best virtues, the foundation of all qualities, but she was not a Shramani.

O Bhagvant! Due to the influence of what karma did she, being the head of the Gachchha, acquire the karma of womanhood? O Gautam! Due to Maya, O Bhagvant! What happened to her due to Maya? - The soul whose world has become weak. Such a soul, due to the rise of all sins, is like a vessel of laddu made from fragrant substances, ghee, sugar, and fine flour, which is enjoyed by all, a place of all suffering and torment, a devourer of all happiness, a hindrance to the pure and supreme Shraman Dharma, which is characterized by non-violence, like the gate of heaven and the door of hell, a repository of all disgrace, ill-repute, blemish, torment, etc., like the black soot of a dark chimney, which stains the pure soul, making it incapable of doing good deeds. Did the head of the Gachchha acquire the nature of a woman?

O Gautam! While she was the head of the Gachchha, she did not indulge in even the slightest Maya. Previously, she was a Chakravarti Raja, who, being tired of the worldly pleasures of the afterlife, renounced the wealth of a Chakravarti, the fourteen jewels, the nine treasures, 64,000 excellent women, 32,000 obedient noble kings, 96 crore foot soldiers, and the entire Bharatvarsha, which was like the earth, and embraced the path of a Shraman, motivated by great merit. She became a great ascetic, a Shruta Dhar, in a short time. Recognizing her worth, the great Guru Maharaj granted her the authority of the head of the Gachchha. O Gautam! Even there, she recognized the path of liberation well. She followed the Shraman Dharma as prescribed, embraced intense austerity, endured severe hardships, renounced the passions of attachment and aversion, governed the Gachchha according to the Agam, renounced the food offered by a Sadhvi throughout her life, avoided the killing of any living beings, did not engage in sexual intercourse, even in a subtle way, did not desire worldly pleasures in this world or the next, was wise, free from the malice of Maya, performed atonement as prescribed, free from any malice, and was completely free from the support of pleasure. She had accumulated a large amount of karma in many births, which she did not exhaust. Due to the small amount of karma she had left, she was born as a woman, like a Muni Deepa Ratna Sagar.

Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'
The text explains that the karma has arisen due to the Maya (illusion) that the being had in other births.
O Bhagvant! How did that great being perform Maya in other births, which led to such terrible karma? O Gautam! The soul of that Gachchadhipa was born as the daughter of a common king, millions of births ago. Once, after her marriage, her husband died immediately. Then her father told the princess, "O Bhadra! I give you fifty kingdoms from my village. From its income, give food, water, clothes, as much wealth, grain, gold, silver, or all kinds of happiness to the blind, the half-bodied, the disabled who cannot walk, those suffering from severe diseases, those defeated by everyone, the poor, the sorrowful, those stained by bodily impurities, those born poor, the Shramanas, the Shravakas, the restless, the relatives, and anyone who desires it. Give them complete compassion and protection. This will prevent you from becoming the cause of unpleasantness and defeat for all beings in future births. And do not become a barren, widowed, unhappy woman, devoid of the means of enjoyment and consumption, such as good fragrance, flower garlands, betel nut, ointments, body adornments, etc., with incomplete desires and a sorrowful birth."
Then, O Gautam! She accepted it with humility. But her cheeks were washed with tears flowing from her eyes, and she said in a hollow voice, "I don't know how to speak much. Go from here and quickly make a large wooden pyre so that I can immerse my body in it. I, a sinner, have no purpose in living now. Perhaps, subject to the fruition of karma, I will become a stain on your lineage, which is renowned throughout the world for its extraordinary name, its fame, and its pure glory, due to the fickle nature of a great sinner like me. My actions might defile your entire lineage." After that, the king thought, "Indeed, I am fortunate to have such a jewel-like daughter, even though I am childless. Oh! The wisdom of this girl! Oh! Her intelligence! Oh! Her knowledge! Oh! Her detachment! Oh! Her form that will stain our lineage! Oh! This girl is worthy of worship every moment, with such great qualities. As long as she remains in my house, my great welfare will be ensured. Seeing her, remembering her, and speaking with her will purify the soul. So, this daughter is like a son to me, who is childless." Thinking this, the king said, "O daughter! According to the customs of our lineage, there is no burning of a widow on a pyre. So, you should follow the path of virtue and the Shravaka dharma, give charity, perform austerities and fasts as you wish, and especially engage in acts of compassion for living beings. This kingdom is also yours." Then, O Gautam! After her father said this, she remained silent, stopping from jumping into the pyre. Then, the father entrusted her to the guards and servants of the inner palace. As time passed, the king died. A wise and great minister, gathering together, decided to crown this princess. Then, she was crowned. O Gautam! After that, she sat in the assembly hall every day.
Now, one day, in that royal assembly, filled with hundreds of men, including wise men, students, Bhattas, Tadingas, Musaddis, clever, discerning, ministers, and Mahants, the princess, subject to the fruition of karma, sitting on the royal throne, saw a handsome young man with beautiful features, radiance, and wealth, with eyes full of desire and passion.
The young man understood her inner feelings. He thought, "This poor princess has fallen into a dark and endless abyss of sorrow because of seeing me. Indeed, I am unfortunate that my body, a machine for generating such desire, a collection of particles, makes me jump into the fire of lust like a moth. What should I do now? I will quickly abandon this sinful body. I will perform severe penance for this.
I will embrace the Aṇagāra dharma, which destroys all sins, just as it abandons all possessions."

Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

I will loosen the group of sinful bonds that I was able to abandon due to the suffering accumulated in many past lives.  A curse on this disorganized world of living beings where the category of senses is so subservient.  Alas, what misfortune that the world does not look towards the loss of the afterlife.  How has the mind become so attached for one birth?  Ignorance of action and consequence, lack of restraint, lack of sharpness, and even the abandonment of shame.  I do not find it appropriate to delay even for a moment in this situation.  It is risky to stay in a place where the arrival of immediate sin, which should be stopped by suffering, is happening.  Ha ha ha, oh shameless enemy!  Such a heap of karma has risen today for this royal girl.  Seeing the form of this body, which is like my storehouse of sin, desire for attachment arose in her eyes.  Now I will abandon this country and embrace renunciation.  Thinking this, Kumaravarna said, "I seek forgiveness from all of you, being free from any pain."  And if I have committed any offense, even unknowingly, may everyone forgive me.  With three-fold purity, I seek forgiveness from the royal family, the citizens of the city, and everyone else who is present in the assembly hall."  Saying this, he went outside.

He reached his residence.  On the way, he took food for the journey.  He wore two pieces of soft white cloth, like the waves of a lake.  He took a simple, vine-like stick, like the heart of a good man, and a half-shield in his left hand.  Then, he walked, offering salutations, praise, and worship to the Arihant Bhagvant, the unique Guru of the three worlds, the best Dharma Tirthankara in the world, according to the proper method.  Walking like this, Kumar reached a distant land, where the capital was Hiranyakkarudi.  He searched for news of the arrival of a Dharmacharaya with special qualities, thinking, "Until the time is right for a Dharmacharaya with special qualities, I will stay here."  Some days passed.  He thought, "I will serve the king of this country, whose fame has spread throughout many lands," and he met the king.  He made a suitable request.  The king honored him.  He received service.

At some point, the king asked Kumar, "Oh noble one, great soul!  Whose name is inscribed on the gem-studded ring that adorns your hand?  For how long have you served which king?  Or, how did your master disrespect you?"  Kumar replied to the king, "I have served the one whose name is inscribed on this gem-studded ring for this long."  Then the king asked, "By what word is he called?"  Kumar said, "Without eating, I will not utter the name of that wicked, eye-gouging wretch."  Then the king asked, "Oh great soul!  Why is he called by that word?  And what is the reason for not uttering his name without eating?"  Kumar said, "I will not utter the word 'eye-gouging wretch' in full.  You will know it directly at some other place.  And then, in a moment of peace, I will tell you the truth.  The reason I did not utter his name without eating is that I did not want to lose the opportunity to eat food during the day if I uttered the name of that wicked, eye-gouging wretch without eating."  Then, oh Gautam!  The king, filled with wonder, asked for a delicious meal out of curiosity.  He sat in the dining hall with the prince and the entire family.  He ordered eighteen kinds of sweet dishes, food, snacks, and various types of food.  At this time, the king said to Kumar, "After eating, you will tell me."  The king said again, "Oh great soul!  You have a morsel in your right hand, now tell me the name."  Perhaps if we face any obstacle in this situation, we will also know it, so let everyone in the city, by your command, strive for their own welfare.  Then, oh Gautam!  That Kumar said, "That wicked, eye-gouging wretch, born in a terrible womb, unworthy of being seen, from the distant province of Durant, has a name that is not worthy of being uttered in words."  Oh Gautam!  As soon as Kumar uttered the name, the enemy's army suddenly and unexpectedly surrounded them.  They were clad in armor, with flags waving above them, and in their forehands were sharp swords, spears, and shining discs, and they shouted, "Kill!"  They were terrifying, having experienced many battles.

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Mahānishītha'

Warriors, who never retreat, who end life, who are of immense strength, valiant, and mighty, arrived. At this time, the king, terrified by the sight of death, fled without regard for the lineage of his family, falling at the feet of the Kumāra. Having found a direction, the king fled with his family. O Gautama! At that time, the Kumāra pondered, "In my lineage, no one has ever turned their back. On the other hand, it is not right for me to strike those who know the Dharma of non-violence and who renounce the taking of life. What should I do now? Should I practice the austerities of fasting and water-abstinence? Even in taking the name of Kuśīla from a single city, such a great loss has occurred. Now, I must also test my own character here." Thinking this, the Kumāra said, "If I become a Kuśīla even in word alone, then no one will be able to leave this capital city safe and sound. If I become steadfast in character in all three ways - mind, speech, and body - then do not strike me with your sharp and terrifying weapon that ends life. 'Namo Arihantāṇam, Namo Arihantāṇam' - chanting this, he started walking towards the gate with its magnificent archway. As he took a step on the ground, someone shouted, "This is the king in the guise of a mendicant!" Saying this, they rejoiced and shouted, "Catch him! Catch him! Kill him! Kill him!" - uttering these words, they rushed towards him, wielding swords and other weapons, like valiant warriors, fierce and deadly enemies. Then, the Kumāra, with a calm mind, fearless and unperturbed, said, "O wicked men! You come to us with such darkness in your hearts. I am the one who has accumulated great merit through many virtuous deeds. Some kings are your true enemies. Do not say that the king has disappeared out of fear. If you have strength and valor, then strike!" As soon as he spoke, they all stopped.

O Gautama! The words of a man adorned with character are insurmountable even for the gods. He remained motionless. Then, he fainted, falling to the ground, unconscious and lifeless. O Gautama! At that time, the deceitful and cunning, wicked king, addressed all the people who were moving around, and all the wise, strong, cowardly, discerning, foolish, brave, fearful, clever, and cunning advisors, saying, "O people! Quickly take from this capital city heaps of diamonds, sapphires, Suryakānta, Chandrakānta gems, the best gems, and treasures, gold, Arjun Tapaniya, Jambunad gold, and so on, weighing a lakh. What more can I say? Give the four-armed army a lakh of khāri (a specific measure used at that time, similar to a pāli) full of pure pearls, corals, and other precious stones, and especially give them news of that man-lion, the pure and virtuous, excellent Kumāra, who is worthy of being received in the morning, so that I may be at peace."

O Gautama! After paying homage to the king, those royal servants, with swiftness and agility, like the wind, mounted their excellent horses and went into the forest, the thicket, the cave of the mountain, and other secluded places. In a moment, they reached the capital city. Then, the prince, with his hands raised to his head, his hair flowing, appeared before them. Before him stood the gods, adorned with golden ornaments and garments, illuminating the ten directions, chanting auspicious words of victory, holding dust-removing fans, and with folded hands, their minds filled with wonder, like statues made of clay.

At that time, O Gautama! The preaching deity, residing in the sky, with a joyful heart and a body filled with excitement, uttered, "Namo Arihantāṇam," and said to the prince, "

Those who can break Mount Meru into pieces with a single punch, swallow the earth, expel Indra from heaven, and in an instant, bring about the welfare of all three worlds, even they cannot compare to one who possesses unshakeable character. Indeed, it is believed that such a person is born, worthy of being worshipped by all three worlds, whether male or female, whoever does not violate their character in the family they are born into. Served by the supremely pure Satpurusha, destroying all sins, a treasure trove of supreme happiness, hail to such seventeen types of character. Saying this, O Gautama! The preaching deities showered flowers on the Kumar, then the deities began to say - Sutra-1504-1506
_ The ignorant souls of the world, afflicted by karma and kshaya, blame their fate or the deities. They do not establish their soul in virtue. They do not dwell in equanimity during times of sorrow. They devise schemes to obtain happiness in vain or through liberation. These are those who dwell in the middle ground of fate, who see everyone with the same eye
and in whom all beings have faith. Whatever is obtained according to karma, they do not cause its deposit or abandonment. So now you all gain understanding. And with the highest character and virtue, bow down to the lotus feet of such a Kumar, free from darkness. Saying this, the deities disappeared. Sutra-1507
Seeing this opportunity, the clever royal minister quickly went to the king and reported what he had seen. Hearing this, the king, whose heart was like a sea of joy and sorrow, full of waves of various possibilities, stood up in fear. The king, with a heart filled with fear and wonder, slowly came through the small door of the secret tunnel, his whole body trembling, with great curiosity, to the region where he was eager to see the Kumar. The king saw the Kumar, the great, noble, well-established, famous, and great-souled Kumar. With the perception of infinite knowledge, he experienced the joys and sorrows of countless births, the attainment of right faith, the world, nature, karma-bondage, its state, how to be liberated from it? He preached the Dharma of non-violence to the king and others who were bound by enmity.
The king, Indra, the lord of the righteous, sitting comfortably, saw the Kumar with a white umbrella held over his head, and seeing such a wonder, which he had never seen before, he, along with his family, attained enlightenment and accepted initiation. The king, the enemy of the wheel-wielding king, also attained enlightenment and accepted initiation. At this time, the deities of the four realms made a great sound with a beautiful, resonant, deep-toned drum, and then proclaimed. Sutra - 1508-1509
O destroyer of the eight knots of karma! O Supreme Lord! O glorious one! Hail to you, with your character, vision, and knowledge. In this world, there is one mother who is worthy of worship every moment, in whose womb a great sage, like Mount Meru, is born and dwells. Sutra - 1510
Saying this, the deities, with hearts full of devotion, showered fragrant flowers, folded their hands in salutation, and descended from the sky, along with Indra. After that, the celestial nymphs danced near the lotus feet of the Kumar. Then they praised him. After bowing down and worshipping for a long time, the assembly of deities went to their own place. Sutra - 1511
O Lord! How did that glorious Kumar, bearing the name Sagrihit, become so wise? O Gautama! In a previous birth, he was in the state of a Shraman, and then he used the rod of words. Because of that,

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Chhedasūtra-5, 'Mahānishīth'

The student/purpose/sūtrāṅka had observed the vow of silence throughout his life from the teachings of his guru. Secondly, he had explained the three great sins, which are as follows: Apkāya, Agnikäya, and Maithuna. All three should be strictly avoided by the sādhus. He had also completely avoided them. Due to this, he became eligible for enlightenment.

Now, one day, O Gautama! The Kumar Maharshi, surrounded by many disciples, set out towards the peak of the Sammet Shikhar mountain to leave his body in the final moments. While traveling, he reached the same path where the princess, Cakṣukushīla, was. The news was given in the royal palace, and the king came to the beautiful garden to pay his respects. The king sat in a suitable place on the ground with his family, after paying respects to the Kumar Maharshi. The Muniśvara gave a detailed discourse on Dharma. After listening to the Dharma discourse, the king, along with his family, became ready to accept renunciation.

O Gautama! The king accepted the initiation here. After accepting initiation, he engaged in severe, heroic, fierce, painful, difficult penance and restraint practices. He lived without attachment to any substance, place, time, or emotion. He spent some time being indifferent to the bodily pleasures of the Chakravarti Indra and other celestial beings, or to worldly pleasures. While traveling, he reached near the peak of the Sammet mountain.

After that, the Kumar Maharshi said to the princess, now a Śramaṇī: "O one who performs difficult tasks! With a peaceful mind, from all perspectives, with your inner self, give me a complete, pure, and free-from-fault criticism quickly, because today we are determined to leave our bodies and are like arrows aimed at the target. We have seen the benefit of removing the fault by performing atonement according to the pure intention, as taught by the Bhagavant, through faultless criticism, condemnation, reproach, and truthful words. After that, the princess, now a Śramaṇī, gave criticism according to the proper method. After that, the Mahāmuni reminded her of the remaining criticism: "When you were sitting in the royal court, you had looked at me with a householder's emotion, with attachment and desire. Give me criticism for that, O one who performs difficult tasks! So that you can achieve the highest purity."

After that, she felt remorse in her mind and thought: "Because of my sinful nature, which is a house of fickle intentions and deceit, and because I am always dwelling in the community of these sādhvīs, perhaps my reputation will be that of a princess, Cakṣukushīla, or one who casts an evil eye?" Thinking this, O Gautama! The blameless Śramaṇī said: "O Bhagavant! I did not look at you with an attached gaze because I did not desire you. But, as you are adorned with the best form, youthful beauty, grace, radiance, and the collection of auspicious qualities, and with an abundance of knowledge and wisdom, I looked at you with an attached gaze to measure you, to see if you were truly indifferent to worldly pleasures and patient. But I did not look at you with the desire of attachment. Or, if there is criticism, what other fault is there? I will also have to do this. What is the benefit of going to the Tirtha and engaging in deceit and trickery?"

The Kumar Muni thought: "If someone were to give a golden coin to a woman who has experienced great emotional turmoil, then one could understand how fickle the nature of women is in the world. Or, it is very difficult to understand their inner feelings."

Thinking this, the Muni said: "What kind of deceit was found in the fickle time? Alas! The fickle, unstable, and restless nature of these wicked, fickle women. They do not establish their minds on one thing, they do not keep their minds steady for even a moment. Alas! They are born wicked, alas! They do all kinds of wrong things, they are deceitful, they are prone to slip-ups, alas! They increase their disgrace and ill-repute, alas! They are proud of their intentions to commit sinful deeds. They will have to go to hell, where they will suffer terrible itching in the darkness of the afterlife, frying in boiling oil, being cooked in a Kumbhi pot, and other such torments. Without fear, a fickle woman exists."

In this way, the Kumar Śramaṇa felt great remorse in his mind. He did not accept her words, but he was a devotee of Dharma.

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

**Study/Purpose/Sutra Number** Kumar Muni, with a very peaceful face and peaceful, sweet words, preached Dharma to the Rajakul Balika Narendrasramani and said, "O Duskarakari! You have accumulated great punya-prakarasha, which does not increase the world, by speaking such words of Maya, and by doing severe, heroic, fierce, difficult tapas, samayam, swadhyay, dhyan, etc. Do not make it futile. There is no purpose in doing such Maya-dambha, which gives endless samsara. By criticizing without hesitation, you have made your soul free from shalya, just as the dance of a river in darkness is meaningless, the effort of a goldsmith in a strong wind is wasted, similarly, you have renounced the Rajagadi, your family, etc., and taken the vow of kesha lochan. Will all the klesh that you have endured, such as bhikhya, bhraman, sleeping on the ground, enduring the twenty-two parisha, enduring upsarga, etc., be in vain? Then the Nirbhagine replied, "O Bhagvant! Do you think I am speaking deceitfully to you? And especially when giving criticism, I cannot deceive you. Believe my story to be true without hesitation. At that time, I did not look at you with any desire for snehraga or raga, but to test you, to see how much water you are in, how firm you are in your sheel, I looked at you. Such a woman, bound by karma-parinati, who has earned the name-karma of an excellent state, has been destroyed. O Gautam! The Rajakul Balika Narendrasramani, with her nature of deceit, has earned the woman-veda for a long time.

After that, the Shiष्यगण family, along with the Maha Tajjub-samaan Swayambuddha Kumar Maharshi, duly performed the Atma's Sanlekhana, and after fasting for a month on the food of plants, attained Nirvana with the Shiष्यगण on the peak of the Sammet mountain, and attained Moksha. Sutra-1512

O Gautam! That Rajakul Balika Narendrasramani, due to the fault of Maya-shalya, was born in the Devlok as a female mongoose in the service of the Dev. From there, she was born again and again, dying in the human and animal realms, experiencing all kinds of misfortune, sorrow, and poverty, and being defeated, humiliated, and hated by all the lokas, experiencing the fruits of her karma. O Gautam! Until she somehow destroyed her karma through the true observance of Shramanapan, became free from all the supports of pramada in all places, and became engaged in the practice of samayam, she burned and destroyed the karma she had done with Maya in that bhava, leaving only a sprout-like bhava. Even then, O Gautam! Due to the fault of that karma, she was born as the wife of a Brahmin, because she did not criticize the raga-filled vision at that time. The Nirvana of the Jiva of that Rajakul Balika Narendrasramani (Samaan Sadhvi) happened. Sutra-1513

O Bhagvant! Whoever undertakes the practice of Shramanapan, will surely attain Siddhi in the first seven or eight bhavas. Then why did this Shramani have to wander in the world for lakhs of bhavas, neither less nor more? O Gautam! Whoever practices Niratichar Shramanapan, will surely attain Siddhi in one to eight bhavas. Whoever is subtle or badar, whoever has Maya-shalya, who enjoys the bhogavata of Apkay, who practices the Atichar of Teukay, will wander for lakhs of bhavas and then attain the right to attain Siddhi. Because, if after attaining Shramanapan, one practices Atichar in it, then one attains Bodhi with sorrow. O Gautam! This Brahmani's Jiva had so little Maya, yet she had to suffer such terrible vipaka. Sutra-1514

O Bhagvant! Did they give that Mahiyari - Gokulpati Bibi a vessel filled with dangs or not? Or did they...

Did Mahiyārī attain liberation by destroying all her karma with them? O Gautama! When she was searching for Mahiyārī to give her a vessel of rice, she was going thinking that she was the daughter of a Brahmin, then Sujnasrī was abducted in the middle. Then, after eating honey and milk, Sujnasrī asked where she was going? She was told another thing in Gokula that if you behave with me with humility, I will give you milk and food filled with jaggery and ghee every day as per your wish. When this was said, Sujnasrī went with Mahiyārī. The restless and tormented minds of Govinda Brāhmaṇa etc. did not even remember Sujnasrī in performing the afterlife rituals. After that, she used to give food like kheer filled with ghee and sugar as Mahiyārī had said.

Now, somehow, the time of the terrible famine of twelve years passed. The whole country became stable with prosperity. Now, at some time, Sujnasīva, having bought twenty precious, excellent gems like Sūryakānta, Chandrakānta etc. of the best caste, set out to return to his country. Due to the sorrow of travelling a long distance, the embodied one, while going on the same path, by the yoga of destiny, reached the Gokula of Mahiyārī, whose name is a sin to even utter, that sinful Sujnasīva reached there by a coincidence. Seeing Sujnasrī, who was superior in beauty and radiance to any woman in the three worlds, due to the fickleness of the senses, the pleasantness of the object, which is like the fruit of the poisonous Kimpaka, which brings infinite suffering, Sujnasīva, who had committed a great sin in the matter of Kāmadeva, who had conquered the entire three worlds, said to Sujnasrī:

"O girl! If your parents allow, I will marry you. I will also make your relatives free from poverty. Then I will make ornaments of gold for you for the entire duration of the universe. Tell this to your parents soon." After that, Sujnasrī, who was experiencing both joy and sorrow, told Mahiyārī this truth. Mahiyārī immediately came to Sujnasīva and said: "Oh! You said you would give gold for the entire duration of the universe for my daughter, show her the best gems." Mahiyārī said: "Give that gold, the child does not need a toy." Sujnasīva said: "Come, let's go to the city and check with the merchants there how effective this toy is."

After that, in the morning, they went to the city and showed the best pair of Chandrakānta and Sūryakānta gems to the king. The king called the gem examiner and said: "Show the value of this excellent gem." If the value is compared and examined, he is not able to tell its value. Then the king said: "Oh! disciple of Mānikya! Is there no man here who can examine the value of this gem?" Then, without getting the price, take the upper ten crore wealth. Then Sujnasīva said: "Whatever grace the king has, it is right. Another request is that we have a Gokula near this mountain, it has a grazing land of one yojana, make it tax-free from the side of the kingdom." The king said: "Okay, it will be so." In this way, making everyone free from poverty and tax-free Gokula, Sujnasīva, whose name is not worthy of utterance, married his daughter Sujnasrī.

Love arose between the two of them. They are spending their time with minds coloured by affection and love. In the meantime, seeing the sadhus who had come home going back without being fed, Sujnasrī cried out loud. Sujnasīva asked her: "O beloved! Why are you in such a sad state seeing the begging couple whom you have not seen before?" Then she said: "When I was my mistress, she used to give a lot of food and water to these sadhus and fill their bowls." After that, the happy mistress, filled with joy, bowed her head and prostrated at their feet. Seeing them, I remembered my mistress. Then she was asked again: "Who was your mistress?" Then, O Gautama! Sujnasrī, who was crying with a choked throat, unable to bear the sorrow, shed tears of anguish, and told the whole story till today. Then Sujnasīva, who was a great sinner, realised that this Sujnasrī was his own daughter.

Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number. Thinking that such a woman should not have such beauty, radiance, grace, loveliness, good fortune, and splendor, he began to lament - Sūtra 1515
In doing such sinful deeds, if a thunderbolt does not strike me with a loud roar, then where will I go from here to become pure? - Sūtra 1516
Saying this, the one who committed the great sin began to think - should I now cut my body into pieces as small as sesame seeds with a weapon? Or should I fall from the peak of a high mountain and break my wicked body into pieces, which is full of infinite sins? Or should I go to a blacksmith's workshop and have my body hammered for a long time like red-hot iron with a thick hammer? Or should I have my body cut open with the sharp teeth of a saw and pour into it molten lead, copper, brass, iron, salt, and the juice of alkali? Or should I pierce my own head with my own hand? Or should I enter the house of a crocodile? Or should I be hung between two trees with a rope, with my head down and my feet up, and fire lit below? What more can I say? Should I go to the cremation ground and burn my body on a pyre of wood? Thinking this, O Gautama! he built a large pyre there, and then, in the presence of all the people, he condemned his soul for a long time and revealed to everyone that I have done such a deed that I should not have done. Saying this, he mounted the pyre, then, by the power of destiny, the contact of that kind of substance and powder, all the wood was considered to be like that, even though he blew on it and tried many ways, the fire did not burn. Then the people said with hatred, "Even this fire is not giving you support. How difficult is your sinful culmination that even this fire is not burning." Saying this, they expelled both of them from Gokul.
On that occasion, they saw a pair of monks coming towards the garden on the same path, having taken food and water from another nearby village. Seeing them, those two sinners followed them. When they reached the garden, they saw Jagānanda, an Āṇagāra named Sugrīta, who was adorned with four knowledgeable disciples, Devendira and Narendra, who were bowing at the feet of the one who possessed all the virtues. Seeing them, they thought, "How can I ask for my purification from this great and glorious monk?" Thinking this, they bowed down and sat on the ground as appropriate in front of the head of the order who was adorned with that group. The head of the order said to Sujnasiv, "O Devanupriyā, quickly criticize the sin without any hesitation and perform penance to end all sins. This girl is pregnant, so she cannot perform penance until she gives birth to the child."
O Gautama! After that, Sujnasiv, who was overwhelmed with great sorrow, criticized all the sinful deeds from birth without any hesitation, and after taking the severe, extremely difficult, and great penance as instructed by the Guru Maharaja, he achieved great purity and strength in his asceticism, and for twenty-six years and thirteen nights and days, he practiced extremely severe, heroic, fierce, painful, difficult, and true austerity, and for one, two, three, four, five, and six months, he continuously fasted without any attachment to his body or its parts, and he remained vigilant in all places, always day and night, striving in self-study, meditation, etc., and burning away the remaining karmic impurities, making them inactive, and taking the क्षपकश्रेणी, he became a Kevali in the अंतगड़ and attained Siddhi. - Sūtra 1517
O Bhagavan! Why did Sujnasiv, who committed such a terrible and great sin, attain liberation so quickly?

## Āgama Sūtra 39, Cheda Sūtra-5, 'Mahānishītha'

**Study/Purpose/Sūtra Number Found?**  Oh Gautama! With what kind of feeling was the Aloayana given, with what kind of emotion was such a severe, difficult, great penance performed? With what kind of pure determination was that kind of extremely severe, heroic, fierce, painful, extremely difficult penance practiced? While practicing that, following the unblemished, unoffending, fundamental, excellent qualities, performing the duties of a Niratichar Shraman, freed from the fierce meditation, the sorrowful meditation, the passions, hatred, delusion, false belief, pride, fear, arrogance, etc., remaining in the middle path, free from humility, with a noble mind, the wise and auspicious Shraman, after performing the Sanlekhana for twelve years, accepting the Anashan of eating only fruits, with that kind of solitary, auspicious determination, did not attain only one Siddhi, but if perhaps he could transfer the karma done by others, then he would have attained the destruction of all the karma of all the Bhavyasattvas and Siddhi.

But the karma done by others is never transferred to anyone. The karma that one has earned, one must suffer it. Oh Gautama! When you become the one who stops the Yoga, then you become the one who destroys the entire karma-mass, but only through the small divisions of time. The destruction of karma of the one who binds karma well and the one who stops the Yoga has been seen, but the destruction of karma by counting time has not been seen. It is said in Sūtra-1518-1523:

Time consumes karma, time binds karma, one binds, one destroys karma. Oh Gautama! Time is infinite, the one who stops the Yoga knows karma, but does not bind karma. He destroys old karma, he has only a reduction of new karma. This is how to know the destruction of karma. Do not count time in this matter. Even though this being is from beginningless time, karma is not complete. When the development of the Virati Dharma occurred due to the destruction and pacification of karma, then, obtaining the time-field, the Bhav and the Bhav dravya, the being, being vigilant, consumed karma, then the being progressed in the Koti path. The one who is negligent binds karma for an infinite time. In the four gatis, the beings who dwell in eternal suffering, therefore, obtaining time, field, Bhav, and Bhav, the intelligent soul quickly destroys karma. Sūtra-1524

Oh Bhagvant! Where was that wise and auspicious one born? Oh Gautama! In the sixth hell, the earth. Oh Bhagvant! For what reason? When the nine months of her womb were complete, she thought, "Tomorrow morning, I will abort the fetus." With this determination, she gave birth to the child. After giving birth, she died immediately. For this reason, the wise and auspicious one went to the sixth hell.

Oh Bhagvant! The child she gave birth to, did he live or not? Oh Gautama! He lived. Oh Bhagvant! How? Oh Gautama! As soon as he was born, the child remained clinging to the fat and blood of the womb, covered in foul-smelling substances, pus, salty, foul-smelling, impure things, an orphan, wailing. A dog placed him on the potter's wheel and began to devour him. Therefore, the potter saw the child, then he and his wife ran towards the child. The dog ran away without destroying the child's body. Then, the compassionate, kind-hearted potter, thinking, "Since I don't have a son, this will be my son," gave the child to his wife. She, with true affection, cared for him and raised him as a human being. The potter, out of social custom, with pride in being his father, named him Susadhu.

Oh Gautama! In due course, he met a virtuous person. Hearing the teachings, he became enlightened. And Susadhu took initiation. He attained supreme faith, emotion, and detachment. He performed extremely severe, heroic, fierce, painful, difficult, great penances. But he did not know how to practice restraint. Due to the fault of Ajayana, he committed offenses in all places where there was no restraint. Then his Guru said to him, "Oh! Great powerful one! Due to the fault of ignorance, you...

**Study/Purpose/Sutra Number**

One who does not know how to achieve Jayana in restraint, becomes a great sufferer of Kayaklesh. He does not always perform Pratikraman with Alochana. Therefore, all your Tapas and restraint become futile. When the Guru inspired him in this way, he always performs Alochana, and the Guru also gives him such Pratikraman that he becomes capable of achieving Jayana in restraint. Accordingly, he always wandered in auspicious Adhyavasaya, free from Artadhyan and Raudra dhyan, day and night.

**O Gautam!** At some point, that sinful soul, who performs Pratikraman according to the duration of fasts like Chhath, Athum, four, five, half-month, one month, up to six months, or other great Kayaklesh, but neglects, disregards, shows disbelief, or becomes lax in the Pratikraman that is capable of burning and reducing the entire mass of sinful karma by the power of the mind, speech, and body, which are the means of achieving Jayana in restraint, the complete restraint of all Asrava, Swadhyay, and Dhyan, etc., and considers it difficult, and does not perform such true Pratikraman. **O Gautam!** That strong soul, after enjoying his due lifespan, died and was born as a Mahardhik Samanik Dev in the Saudharma Kalpa, under the rule of Indra Maharaj. From there, he was born as Vasudev in the seventh hell, the earth. From there, he was born as a large elephant, and after dying in the state of sexual desire, he went to the Ananta Kaya plant. **O Gautam!** This is the strong soul who, despite performing Alochana, Ninda, Gardha, and Pratikraman, will wander in the world for a long time due to not knowing Jayana. **O Bhagvant!** What Jayana did he not recognize, that even after performing such difficult Kayaklesh, he will wander in the world for such a long time? **O Gautam!** Jayana is said to be the complete and uninterrupted observance of all eighteen thousand limbs of Shila, day and night, throughout life, and the proper performance of all restraint practices. He did not understand these seven things. Therefore, he will wander in the world for a long time, being devoid of liberation.

**O Bhagvant!** Why did Jayana not come to his mind? **O Gautam!** If he had renounced the use of water with awareness, even for one-eighth of the Kayaklesh he endured, he would have attained Siddhi. But he consumed water with awareness. For one who consumes water with awareness, any Kayaklesh becomes futile.

**O Bhagvant!** Apkay, Agni Kay, and Mithun are considered the places of great sin. They are the causes of A-Bodhi. A truly restrained Sadhu should renounce these three in solitude. He should not consume them. Therefore, he did not understand that Jayana. **O Bhagvant!** Why are Apkay, Agni Kay, and Mithun considered the causes of A-Bodhi? **O Gautam!** The beginning of all six Kayas is considered the place of great sin, but the beginning of Apkay and Agni Kay is destructive to infinite Satva. The consumption of Mithun leads to the destruction of countless living beings.

**O Gautam!** The consumption of these three Kayas is considered a great sin because it leads to the destruction of infinite Satva and countless living beings. They are under the influence of A-prashast Adhyavasaya, being filled with Sajjad Raga-Dvesha and Moha. Therefore, **O Gautam!** Those living beings who engage in such sinful behavior, consuming the beginning of these Kayas, do not become worthy of accepting the first Mahavrata. The lack of the first Mahavrata leads to the lack of other Mahavrata and restraint practices. Therefore, it is considered completely contradictory to the path of a Shraman. Therefore, it is the destroyer of the path of Samyag Marg. Therefore, whatever karma-bandhan one creates, one is born in hell, animal realm, and human realm countless times, where one does not even hear the words of Dharma in dreams, and wanders in the world without attaining Dharma. Therefore, water, fire, and sexual intercourse are considered the causes of A-Bodhi.

**O Bhagvant!** If one performs such great Kayaklesh, like fasting for six, eight, four, five days, half a month, one month, up to six months, continuously, which is very severe, heroic, fierce, painful, difficult, and devoid of Jayana, then what...

## Agam Sutra 39, Chhed Sutra-5, 'Mahanishith'

Is the study/purpose/sutra number meaningless?  O Gautama! Yes, it is meaningless. O Bhagvant! For what reason? O Gautama! Even animals like donkeys, camels, bulls, etc., without the victory of restraint, are subjected to heat, warmth, burden, beating, etc., without desire, and suffer pain without desire, and become free from action, and go to Saudharma Kalpa, etc. Even there, due to the destruction of the karma of enjoyment, they deviate and go to the state of animals, etc., and become those who follow the world or wander in the world. And they become the recipients of the gross, terrible suffering of birth, aging, death, etc., and physical and mental suffering, which is full of impure stench, melted flowing alkali, bile, vomit, phlegm, fat clinging to the body, rough, dark, full of blood mud, repulsive, dark group, pain in the womb, entry into the womb, birth, aging, death, etc. The destruction of the gross, fierce, Maha-Roudra, terrible suffering of birth, aging, death, etc., without the victory of restraint, does not happen alone. Therefore, restraint without victory, or even great bodily torment, is meaningless.

O Bhagvant! Does one who sees, observes, and performs the victory of restraint well, quickly escape the suffering of birth, aging, death, etc.? O Gautama! There are some who do not escape such suffering quickly, and some who do escape quickly. O Bhagvant! Why do you say so? O Gautama! There are some who, without seeing the assembly place, without expectation, without attachment, and with pain, perform the torment of restraint. Those who are of this kind, for a long time, are freed from the worldly suffering of birth, aging, death, etc. There are also some souls who, by eradicating all pain, become free from beginning and attachment, free from attachment and ego, whose stains of attachment, aversion, delusion, and falsehood have gone, who are extremely pure in intention, with a humble mind, who desire to become free from action alone, who have supreme faith, emotion, detachment, and are free from the support of fear, pride, various kinds of negligence, who have conquered severe suffering and adversity, who have removed fierce attention, who have the capacity to consume the victory of restraint as it should be, to observe it well, to follow it, to follow the victory of restraint in a special way, and to perform it properly. Those who are the recipients of such restraint and victory, quickly escape the net of such worldly suffering as aging, death, etc. O Gautama! Therefore, it is said that one escapes the world quickly, and one does not escape quickly.

O Bhagvant! After being freed from the worldly net of birth, aging, death, etc., where does the soul reside? O Gautama! Where there is no aging, no death, no disease, no disgrace, no false accusations, no suffering, no anxiety, no conflict, no strife, no pain, no poverty, no suffering, no separation from the beloved. What more can be said? It resides in liberation, which is alone, indestructible, firm, eternal, unique, and full of infinite happiness. Thus it is said.
