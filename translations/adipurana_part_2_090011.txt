## Adipurana

The 'Adipurana', composed by Acharya Jinsen (9th century), is a highly significant text that illuminates the origins and development of Indian culture and history, along with the virtuous lives of the first Tirthankara, Rishabhdev, and Bharat Bahubali. It is essential for the study of Jain culture and history. This is not just a Purana text, but also a great epic. From the perspective of subject matter, it is considered to be a Dharma Shastra, Rajniti Shastra, and Achar Shastra. It has gained international recognition for its presentation of the primordial order of human civilization. The text elaborates on various aspects like the evolution of human society, its classification into different groups, religious rituals of specific classes, and many more. It has served as a source of inspiration for later poets in Sanskrit and various Indian languages.

The complete work (Adipurana) has been published in two volumes by the Bharatiya Gyanpeeth. The editor of the text is Dr. Pannalal Jain, a distinguished scholar of Jain philosophy and Sanskrit literature. The text includes the Sanskrit original along with a Hindi translation, a significant introduction, and appendices in the form of glossaries of technical, geographical, and personal terms. This makes it an indispensable text for researchers, especially those studying Puranas and poetic literature from a comparative perspective.

From the perspective of subject matter, the third part of the text is the 'Uttara Purana' (Gyanpeeth publication) composed by Acharya Gunabhadra, which elaborates on the lives of the remaining 23 Tirthankaras, 11 Chakravartis, 9 Balbhadra, 9 Narayanas, 9 Pratinarayanas, and various contemporary kings and legendary figures after Rishabhdev.

This is a new revised edition of both parts of the Adipurana.

## Adipurana

This is the detailed story of Jayakumar.  Sulochana, the daughter of King Akampan, held a Swayamvara (self-choice marriage ceremony) in Kashi, adorned with a Patta (sacred thread) and surrounded by great splendor.  Jayakumar was chosen as her husband when Sulochana's father placed a garland around his neck in the mandap (ceremonial pavilion).

**Chapters 351-385**

Akampan became detached from the world.  He contemplated the nature of detachment (Vairagya) and, after the Swayamvara ended, he initiated the son of Chakravarti Bharat into the path of liberation.  Akampan then attained Nirvana along with Queen Suprabha.  A fierce battle ensued between Arkkirti and Jayakumar.  Ultimately, Jayakumar emerged victorious.  Suprabha was reborn in heaven as per her karma.

**Chapters 442-443**

The foresight of Akampan and Bharat brought peace to the war between Jayakumar and Sulochana, resolving their differences.

**Chapters 443-445**

A detailed account of the various enjoyments of Jayakumar and Sulochana.

**Chapters 386-424**

One day, Jayakumar and Sulochana were sitting on the roof of their house, with Sulochana praising her daughter's character and contentment.  Jayakumar was praising Arkkirti when his gaze fell upon a pair of Vidyadharas (celestial beings) passing by in the sky.  He recognized them as his previous birth parents and, overcome with emotion, fainted.  Sulochana, calling out "My beloved Rativara," also fainted.  After being revived, Jayakumar asked Sulochana why she had fainted.  She recounted the story of their previous lives.

**Chapters 425-431**

The love story of Jayakumar and Sulochana.

**Chapters 446-479**

Jayakumar expressed his desire to return to his city.  Akampan bid them farewell with great pomp and ceremony.  On their way, Jayakumar went to meet Chakravarti Bharat.  Bharat received him with great honor.  Jayakumar and Sulochana discussed their past lives.

**Chapters 480-500**

While returning from Ayodhya, Jayakumar and Sulochana were traveling along the Ganges towards their camp.  Jayakumar inquired about Shri Pal, a deity.  Sulochana, in her eloquent voice, narrated the story of Shri Pal, who had taken the form of a crocodile and swallowed Chakravarti's elephant.  Jayakumar and the elephant were about to drown in the Ganges when Sulochana, through the power of the Panchanamaskara mantra, saved them.

## Adipurana, Part Two, Subhashitas:

**"Alas, how painful is poverty!"**

**"What is pleasing is not lost to anyone."**

**"Indeed, even the neutrality of those with intense passions is painful."**

**"The desires of the great are wondrous."**

**"Alas, how steadfast are the great souls!"**

**"He who shines brightly, whose life is free from the stains of pride, is not recognized by mere qualities or signs."**

**"A man is truly a man, a fickle man, who, even without qualities, is considered a man by name alone."**

**"He is a man who purifies his family and birth through his valor. People call him a hero."**

**"Truth is an insult that the proud cannot bear. Opposition from the strong is the cause of one's own defeat."**

**"Even among the strong, there are stronger ones, those with a strong mind. Therefore, one should not boast, 'I am strong.'"**

**"Worship and honoring of beings in this world and the next is for their elevation. Transgression of worship and honoring brings suffering."**

**"One who is not interested in pleasures is not satisfied in this world."**

**"What is stronger than punya (merit) in the world? It is unconquerable."**

**"There is no better means than punya for the fulfillment of desires."**

**"There is no better means of control in the world than punya."**

**"Punya spreads like water on land, and land on water. Punya quickly controls suffering. Punya is the third refuge in fear of water and land. Do punya, this is the teaching of the Jinas."**

**"Punya is the supreme refuge in adversity, it is insurmountable. Punya is a giver of wealth to the poor. Punya is a treasure that brings happiness to those seeking happiness. This is the teaching of the Jinas, therefore, cultivate punya."**

**"The first way to achieve punya is through the worship of the Jinas. Another way is through giving to worthy recipients. Another way is through following vows and practicing austerities. This is the fourfold path to punya for those seeking it."**

**"What is the use of serving a wish-fulfilling tree if it bears little or no fruit?"**

**"Indeed, the king is a great actor."**

**"Everyone desires a pleasing object."**

**"The wise are of few words."**

**Note:** The numbers after each subhashita refer to the chapter and verse number in the Adipurana.

##  Adipurana, Chapter 34 & 35:

**12**

"He who is immersed in the darkness of anger and does not liberate himself, he is unable to distinguish between right and wrong action, and is caught in the middle."

"How can one who is ignorant of his own self know what is right and what is wrong? How can one who is unable to conquer his own inner enemies be a true master?"

"True glory in the world is lasting, not fleeting wealth."

"Even at the end of his life, will a bee, intoxicated by the fragrance of flowers on the head of an Apsara, desire anything other than honey?"

"Even if a barren land dries up, what else would it desire, having received the rain from the clouds, the water from the sky, and the coolness from the moon?"

"Those who are bound by karma rise up for liberation."

"All actions, both external and internal, are for the purification of the soul."

"True austerity manifests itself and bears great fruit."

"This is the nature of a wicked person: to force their views on others, to boast of their own virtues, and to find fault with others."

"A wicked person exposes the faults of others and hides his own, while praising his own virtues and concealing the virtues of others."

"An ignorant person, clinging to the fruits of his actions, which are devoid of true happiness, embraces wickedness as if it were a vine."

"I consider this wickedness, which is accepted by the virtuous, praised by the world, and yields bitter fruits, to be a vine of suffering that binds the world."

"Complete pacification is not prescribed in the presence of heat. Even in the presence of a dear one, applying water to burning ghee is not effective."

"Similarly, I believe that even a great offering is not effective in the case of a powerful fire. How can a thousand logs extinguish a blazing fire?"

"Just as heated iron does not become soft, so too, a cruel person does not become gentle even with punishment. Even a hunter does not become friendly with a deer, even if he is offered gifts."

"Even an old elephant can carry a load, but what can a young calf do?"

"The sun alone is radiant, what else is greater than it?"

"The fruit of one's own actions is praiseworthy, but the fruit of another's actions is like a creeper on another's tree, not to be desired."

"A king who desires wealth obtained by harming others, is like a drum that makes a sound like a snake, seeking liberation."

"A king who accepts wealth obtained by harming others, carries the burden of his own wickedness, like a heavy cloak."

"He who desires to live by enjoying pleasures obtained by harming others, is like a broken chariot, how can he have any strength?"

"Even without breaking the umbrella, the shadow is broken. Similarly, he who carries the burden of harming others, has his head bowed."

"If even the sages are equal, having renounced all possessions, who would desire to rule a kingdom for the sake of worldly pleasures?"

"It is better to live in the forest, it is better to give up one's life, than to be subservient to a wicked person, for a man of noble lineage."

Then Chakradhara performed the worship of the Chakra Ratna according to the prescribed rituals.  He also celebrated the birth of his son with great joy.  || 1 ||

"No one was poor in the world during that great festival of the king.  Poverty had become a thing of the past, as all the beggars were satisfied."  || 2 ||

The king had piled up jewels in the four crossroads, in the streets, inside and outside the city, and he gave them all to the beggars.  || 3 ||

The worship of the Chakra Ratna performed by Bharat was like a curse to his enemies, and the celebration of the birth of his son was like a peace-making ceremony for the world.  || 4 ||

Then, as Bharat was preparing for his conquest of the directions, the autumn season arrived.  It was like Bharat's victorious Lakshmi, adorned with a clear and pure sky.  || 5 ||

The swarms of bees, their bodies adorned with pollen from the Saptaparna flowers, were like the beautiful braids of autumn.  || 6 ||

Just as the excellent poetry of poets is pleasing and delights the hearts of people, so too the water of ponds and rivers became clear and joyful, delighting the hearts of men.  || 7 ||

The rows of swans flying around were adorned, as if they were the Lakshmi of autumn.  || 8 ||

The lotus pond, filled with lotus pollen, appeared radiant, as if the earth's surface were covered with golden dust. || 9 ||

The water of the pond was obstructed on all sides by lotus pollen. Seeing this, the wives of the Kadamba swans were repeatedly deceived, thinking it was land. || 10 ||

The bees, trapped in the clusters of lotus filaments, appeared like golden beads, like a necklace of the autumn season. || 11 ||

The melodious white birds gathered around the lotus pond, like devotees praising the virtues of a generous family. || 12 ||

The banks of the rivers were clean in the autumn season, as if they were beds made of white cloth for the swans. || 13 ||

The ponds with lotuses, the fields with blue lotuses, and the rivers with swan-filled banks, all stole the hearts of the amorous. || 14 ||

The clear, straight streams of the pond, filled with pairs of cranes, were adorned with the beautiful sounds of the trumpeting swans. || 15 ||

The autumn goddess, with eyes like blue lotuses and a face like a lotus, seemed to be conversing with the swans through their sweet sounds. || 16 ||

The fields of ripe rice, with their drooping grains and yellow hue, appeared as if they were adorned with turmeric, like a woman dressed for her husband's arrival in the autumn season. || 17 ||

The swans were filled with joy, while the peacocks lost their joy, upon seeing the beauty of the autumn season. This is the nature of purity and impurity. || 18 ||

The twenty-sixth chapter. The Shikhandi, like laughing swans, were making a loud noise. Oh, you are *jadapriya* (fond of the inert, i.e., water) - how pure your forms are!  || 16 ||  The peacocks, with their variegated colors, their desires fixed on the clouds, and dwelling in the mountains, along with the rainbows, abandoned their own prosperity.  || 20 ||  Did not the *bandhuka* flowers, shining like drops of betel juice spat out by the goddess of autumn, enhance the beauty of the *indragopas* (red insects of the rainy season) in the forests?  || 21 ||  Just as a virtuous woman, with a pure heart, free from sin, and wearing clean clothes, appears outside her home, and embraces love for her relatives, so too, the pure autumn, with a clear sky free from mud, appeared and embraced the *bandhujeevas* (flowers of the afternoon) - she caused them to flourish.  || 22 ||  The sounds of the swans were like drums, the *kash* flowers in the forests were like bright *chamaras* (fly whisks), and the lotuses in the ponds were blooming like the sun.  And from all this, the autumn seemed to have a desire to conquer the directions.  || 23 ||  The autumn adorned the directions with *banasana* (flowers of the *bana* and *asana* species).  Indeed, it is fitting for a king who desires to conquer to take up the *banasana* (bow).  || 24 ||  The clouds, abandoning all hope (i.e., desire for union), became thin and pale.  It seemed as if they had become so due to the anxiety caused by the separation from the rainy season.  || 25 ||  The sky, adorned with stars, was so beautiful that it seemed to be laughing like a lake with lotuses.  || 26 || 

Page #22:
---------------------------
The Adipurana describes a beautiful autumn night. The sky, like a clear lake, is adorned with stars, which resemble pearls strung on a necklace. The moon, like a swan, spreads its rays, which are like its wings. The stars, like flowers, add to the beauty of the sky, which is like a house. The rivers, like women, are thin and weak, having lost their strength due to the absence of rain. They are like widows, dressed in white and devoid of any arrogance. The directions, like women, are illuminated by the stars and are happy, laughing with each other. The peacocks have stopped their cries, defeated by the sweet sounds of the swans. The autumn night, dressed in moonlight, is adorned with a necklace of stars and is beautiful. The moon, like a king, shines brightly, spreading its fame like moonlight. The autumn night, like a newlywed bride, is surrounded by her friends, the swans, and is adorned with the light of the stars.

## The Twenty-Sixth Chapter

5. The sky seemed to have cleansed itself, the moon appeared to have washed itself, the rivers seemed to have purified themselves, and the directions seemed to have been swept clean. || 38 ||

The people's eyes were filled with great joy in the moon-disc, which was like a mirror reflecting the face of the autumn-goddess, Lakshmi, and which was extremely bright without needing to be polished. || 39 ||

The rows of trees, fragrant and adorned with flowers, were being enjoyed by the bees, who were making a loud buzzing sound. || 40 ||

The vines in the forest, with their blooming flowers, were smiling, and they were adorned with beautiful hair, being filled with groups of bees blinded by their fragrance. They looked like slender women. || 41 ||

The bulls, with their hooves digging into the earth, their eyes red, and angered by the sight of other bulls, were roaring in response to the sounds of the other bulls. || 42 ||

With their deep roars, the bulls were digging into the forest floor, which was covered with the fragments of lotus stalks. || 43 ||

In that autumn season, the bulls, with their shoulders covered in mud and white like the Kumuda flower, were adorned with the beauty of the moon, which had clear markings. || 44 ||

The excellent cows, with their milk flowing freely, were spreading their milk over the entire forest floor, roaming here and there within the woods. || 45 ||

Similarly, the cows, who had given birth once, with their breasts heavy like pots and pure like they were made of a lump of nectar, were shining in the middle of the forests, like the beauty of autumn. || 46 ||

The cows, whose udders were very large and who were making the sound 'hum bha', were eager to drink milk and were feeding their calves with the nectar of milk, making the sound 'hum bha' again and again. ||47|| The cows, who had come to the cowherds under a contract, were feeding their calves, who were eager to drink milk and were making the deep sound 'hum bha', even though they were tied up. ||48|| The clouds, which were once very dear to the peacocks, had become unpleasant to them in the autumn season, because they were empty due to the loss of their water wealth. Alas, how painful is poverty! ||49|| The mountains, adorned with flowering trees, seemed to be laughing at each other, and the cascading waterfalls seemed to be pouring water on each other. ||50|| The kalma grass, which was very lush and had many birds sitting on it, was flourishing and nourishing all the creatures of the world, just like old men. ||51|| The sahajna trees, surrounded by a swarm of intoxicated bees, were adorned with their flowers, which seemed to be adorned with golden ornaments with an indigo gem in the middle. ||52|| Just as a dancer, adorned with ornaments, comes out of the dressing room and delights the eyes, so too did the directions, freed from the cover of the clouds, delight the eyes. ||53|| The mountains, which had donned a group of white, waterless clouds on their peaks, seemed to be wearing new clothes with shawls. ||54|| The cloud-elephants, with the wind as their charioteers, were roaming here and there, roaring from within and releasing drops of nectar, like drops of water, in the arbors. ||55|| The parrots, whose beaks were red like coral, were decorating the sky with their beautiful plumage, like a garland of green gems with lotuses. ||56||

The twenty-fifth chapter, the minds of those who live by boats are dejected, like the dejected minds of men who have lost their authority. ||57|| The glorious one, the sole eye of the universe, the ever-rising sun, shining brightly, like the king of the Bharatas. ||58|| Thus, with the clear rays of the moon, in the arrival of autumn, the Chakravarti, with the Chakra jewel in front, undertook the campaign of conquest. ||59|| At that time, the deep sounds of the drums of departure were heard, which were listened to by the peacocks, who raised their necks, fearing the pomp of the clouds. ||60|| The lord, adorned with auspicious ornaments, wore a chest adorned with garlands and white sandalwood, as if the goddess of autumn was serving him. ||61|| The king wore two divine garments, white like the moonlight, fine and soft, as if they were brought as gifts by the goddess of autumn. ||62|| The lord was adorned with the Brahma Sutra, hanging down to his knees, like the Himalayas adorned by the flow of the Ganges water touching its banks. ||63|| The king, whose head was raised high by the crown, wore earrings in both his ears, as if the sun and moon had come to congratulate him on his victory. ||64|| The Kaustubha gem, shining brightly on the chest of the king of the Bharatas, was as beautiful as a lamp of auspiciousness, signifying the rise of victory and prosperity. ||65||

## The Adi Purana

**66.** The king, who had donned a parasol that rivaled the moon's disc, seemed as if the moon itself had come to serve him.

**67.** The parasol he wore, adorned with jewels, shone like a lotus with the rays of the sun.

**68.** The women, waving chowries that rivaled the moon's rays, stood around him like celestial nymphs.

**69.** The architect, with a heart devoid of ego, constructed a magnificent chariot, adorned with gold and jewels, its splendor rivaling the gardens of Mount Meru.

**70.** The chariot, with two wheels that rivaled the gem-studded wheels, was fitted with an axle made of diamond, making it a fitting vehicle for the king's desires.

**71.** The chariot was drawn by horses that moved at will, swift as the wind, radiant as the moon, and majestic as a host of victories.

**72.** The king, like Indra on Mount Meru, ascended the chariot, guided by a skilled charioteer.

**73.** The king, blessed with auspicious chants, set out on his conquest, having performed all the auspicious rituals for his departure.

**74.** The sky, filled with shouts of victory, echoed with the sounds of war. The king's court was filled with generals.

**75.** The kings, adorned with great crowns, stood around him, bowing their heads in reverence, as if they were celestial beings surrounding Indra.

**76.** The army, filling the streets of the city, marched forth. The world, filled with warriors, witnessed a spectacle never seen before. 

Page #27:
---------------------------
The twenty-sixth chapter:

The army of the king, consisting of foot soldiers, chariots, horses, and elephants, marched forth in order, surrounding the king's chariot, which was adorned with flags. 

The roads, covered with golden dust raised by the chariots and horses, seemed to have been lifted up into the sky, unable to bear the weight of the army. 

The sky, filled with golden dust, shone like a courtyard touched by the rays of the morning sun and sprinkled with fragrant powder. 

The streets of the city, emptied by the departing people, resembled the shores of the ocean after the receding tide. 

The women of the city, standing in the windows of their houses, showered the king with flowers, their eyes filled with admiration. 

"Victory to you, O Lord, O Conqueror! Conquer the world and the ten directions!" Thus, the citizens of Ayodhya showered the king with blessings and paid their respects. 

Seeing the splendor of Ayodhya, the king slowly approached the gate, adorned with jeweled arches. 

Before him, behind him, and on either side, the king saw an endless sea of soldiers, as far as his eye could see. 

From the womb of the world, like a new creation, the army emerged from the city, slowly pushing through the gate. 

"Is this the water of the ocean, churned by the turmoil of the apocalypse? Or is this the birth of a new creation of the three worlds?" Thus, the gods in the sky, filled with wonder, watched as the army of the king spread out from the city, like a wheel rolling forth.

---------------------------
The Adipurana then describes how the great king Bharat, having resolved to conquer the eastern direction, set out towards the east, following the jewel-like chakra.  || 8 || The chakra, blazing like the sun and adorned by the gods, moved ahead of the king, a weapon of unparalleled brilliance. || 86 || The king's army, like a group of munis following their guru's will, followed the chakra, their strength guided by the lord of treasures. || 10 || The jewel-like danda, led by the commander-in-chief, marched ahead, skillfully leveling the uneven terrain and fortresses. || 11 || The danda, leading the way, transformed every path into a royal road, allowing the army to move effortlessly and according to their will. || 12 || As they journeyed, the lord of directions, Bharat, saw the beauty of the autumn season, as pure and radiant as his own glory. || 13 || The lakes, adorned with lotuses, exuded a sweet fragrance, like the breath of the goddess of autumn, filling Bharat with joy. || 14 || He saw swans, their feathers glistening, feeding on the sweet cream of the lotus, like the sons of autumn. || 15 || A swan, picking up a lotus stalk in its beak and offering it to its mate, filled the heart of the great king Bharat with immense delight. || 16 || He saw a male cakravaka, calling out loudly, filling the air with its melodious voice, as it searched for its mate, hidden by the waves. || 17 || A young swan, mistaking its own feathers, stained yellow by the pollen of the lotus, for its mate, had abandoned her. Bharat witnessed this too. || 18 || A foolish old swan, mistaking a cakravaka, whose body was white from the waves, for his mate, was chasing after her. || 19 || In the sandy banks of the river, amidst the swans and sarasas, Bharat saw a place of rest, pure and limitless. || 20 ||

## The Twenty-Sixth Chapter:

**101.** The king saw the banks of the rivers, adorned with flowers blooming from the tips of creepers, and the water, filled with waves, reflecting the sky.

**102.** He was delighted by the beautiful creeper-gardens, where beds were made of fallen flowers.

**103.** In some places, he saw Kinnaras, attached to their own glory, resting on moonstone slabs within the creeper-gardens.

**104.** In some places, he saw swarms of bees lost in the flowers of the creepers, and remembered his beloved women, whose hair was loose and flowing.

**105.** The trees along the path, with their branches swaying in the wind, seemed to shower flowers on the king's head, as if in love.

**106.** He saw the trees along the path, with their shade, fruits, and height, resembling kings in their splendor, offering their bounty to all.

**107.** He saw the banks of the lakes, covered with the pollen of lotuses, making them appear as if they were covered in gold dust, causing travelers to wonder.

**108.** He saw the Chakwai bird, crying out in the night-like sky, filled with dust from the army, mistaking it for night.

**109.** He saw herds of cows grazing in the forest pastures, their milk flowing continuously, like clouds of milk, soaking the surrounding land.

**110.** He saw the lotus flowers, born from the tips of the mountains, fragrant and beautiful, like the glory of the Kiratas, filled with pride.

**111.** The king was greatly pleased by the beautiful Sarasa birds and the riverbanks, which seemed like beds spread out.

The Lord saw the farmers, who were distressed by the army's forceful demands, running around in their fields. || 120 || The Lord also saw the fields, which were filled with farmers, and the nearby lands surrounding each village. || 121 || He saw the paths near the villages, which were uneven due to the clear marks of cow hooves, and were very narrow. || 122 || He saw the powerful village chiefs standing around the villages, and the large gardens with trees that were served by birds and humans. || 123 || He passed by the villages, which were surrounded by fences covered with gourd and bottle gourd flowers, and where birds could fly from one to another. || 124 || The Lord was delighted to see the vines near the huts, which were bent down with fruits and flowers, and the virtuous women who were blessed with sons. || 125 || The women of the villages, who were adorned with golden necklaces and bangles, and were standing in the shade of the fences, captivated the Lord's mind. || 126 || The great men of the villages, with their pots of ghee, vessels of yogurt, and various fruits, came to see him. || 127 ||

Thus ends the twenty-sixth chapter of the **Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra**, a collection of the **Mahāpurāṇa** composed by the **Bhagawājina** **Senācārya**, known as **Ārya**, which narrates the exploits of King Bharata's conquest of the directions. || 26 ||

## Twenty-Seventh Chapter

Then the king of men, Bharat, cast his gaze upon the Ganga, which seemed to be offering him a foot-bath with its pure waters. || 1 ||

Seeing the king's gaze fixed upon the Ganga, the charioteer spoke words that delighted his mind, saying, "This is a timely opportunity, O King!" || 2 ||

This Ganga, like the words of the Lord Rishabhadeva, brings joy to all the worlds. Just as the words of Rishabhadeva destroy all sins, so too does this Ganga destroy dust and impurities. || 3 ||

This Ganga, filled with deep and pure water, purifies the Himalayas at its source and the ocean at its confluence. || 4 ||

Just as great sages, upon attaining the profound and sorrow-destroying knowledge of true wisdom, become free from pride, so too do these wild elephants, upon reaching this deep and sorrow-destroying Ganga, become calm, shedding their pride, the water that flows from their temples. || 5 ||

Here, these forest elephants drink its water, making a sound, and there, the clouds of the autumn season fill it with rain. || 6 ||

The ocean, with its deep nature, always holds the flow of this Ganga, which even the lofty and ever-immovable Mount Vijaya could not bear. || 7 ||

Perhaps the ocean, whose inner being is constantly burning with its salty water, will be quenched by the flow of this Ganga's water. || 8 ||

This Ganga, born from the Padma lake in the Himalayas, like a pure mind, has become famous on earth. It is right that she is revered, for she who is born pure is worthy of worship. || 9 ||

They call this Ganga, which descends from the sky, the home of the goddess Ganga, who floods the entire world with her flowing waters. || 10 || 

Page #37:
---------------------------
The Twenty-Seventh Chapter

This Himāvan (Himalayas) bears the Ganga, which is as pure as the rays of the moon, spreads as far as the ocean, and purifies the world, as its own fame. || 11 || This Ganga is adorned by the two forests on either side of its banks, as if it were wearing two blue garments. || 12 || This river bears a row of swans, whose bodies are yellowed by the pollen of lotuses, and who make sweet sounds, as if it were wearing a golden girdle that makes a soft sound. || 13 || This Ganga, pure as the particles of clean clay, bears other rivers, its companions, as if it were bearing friends, for such friendship is indeed praiseworthy. || 14 || This Ganga, served by many royal swans (great kings among birds), shines like your royal Lakshmi, who inspires love in the world, and whose glory cannot be surpassed. || 15 || This Ganga bears the Vana-vedikā, which is very high, made of gold, transcends the path of the sky, and cannot be violated, as if it were your command. || 16 || O God, be pleased and behold this autumnal beauty, which has established itself in the forests, rivers, and ponds. || 17 || These seven-leaved trees scatter the pollen of their flowers, which are fragrant and spread their fragrance in all directions, like fragrant powder. || 18 || Here, the trees of the Bāna species, which are blooming like the arrows of Kāmadeva, are captivating the hearts of amorous men. What is beautiful does not captivate? Or what is not pleasing to the eye? || 19 || Here, in the ponds, ordinary lotuses are blooming along with blue lotuses, and they look like the mouths of Lakshmi, the goddess of autumn, whose eyes are blooming. || 20 || Here, these bees, greedy for fragrance, are immersed in the lotuses, making a kind of indistinct sound, just as amorous men are immersed in the lotus-like mouths of women, making flattering speeches. || 21 || These bees, eager for the nectar, are moving about in the lotus-like nests, like arrows of desire, with their wings like lotus-like arrows. || 22 || 

That is, the Himāvan mountain is above the earth, and therefore it is also called the Milky Way. || 10 || 

Page #38:
---------------------------
The Adipurana describes:

**Verse 23:** These honey-devotees, their bodies stained with the saffron of lotuses, are like sparks of the fire of desire, their bodies golden-yellow.

**Verse 24:** On the ground, the lotus-like flowers bloom, like the tents of the conquering autumn, adorned with the colors of the season.

**Verse 25:** Mistaking the land lotus for a water lotus, the goose, its wings still, enters the lake, its body covered in the pollen of the lotus.

**Verse 26:** This goose, with its bright beak, picks up the soft, moon-like lotus petal, thinking it is a sweet, creamy substance, and gives it to its young.

**Verse 27:** These royal geese, their wings cleansed of the pollen of the lotus, swim diligently in the lake, their bodies covered in the pollen of the lotus.

**Verse 28:** The swan, its eyes filled with tears, cries out in sorrow, unable to see its beloved, the female swan, who has been hidden by the waves on the shore.

**Verse 29:** The swan, its body white from the waves of the lake, approaches its beloved, the female swan, who does not desire him, making a sound.

**Verse 30:** This forest of saptaparna trees, along the banks of the Ganges, shines with the pollen of its flowers, as if it were adorned with a canopy of flowers in the sky.

**Verse 31:** The wind, born from the waves of the Mandakini, touches our bodies gently, removing the fatigue of the journey and shaking the trees on the shore.

**Verse 32:** This wind, carrying the drops of the Ganges, seems to be welcoming us, as if it were a guest, shaking the trees in the forest.

**Verse 33:** This forest, devoid of the sound of cattle, is inhabited by gods, its interior adorned with arbors of vines and flower-strewn paths.

The Nichula tree, blooming alongside the mango tree, enhances the beauty of this forest, adding the splendor of spring to the glory of the rainy season.  (46)  The Madhavi creeper, adorning the forest with its delightful laughter, is flourishing today in this forest, adding to the beauty of the forest-goddess. (47)  These Madhavi creepers, blooming in the spring, are spreading the joy of the season, their fragrance intoxicating the bees. (48)  The summer, with its pure, white smile, is setting foot on the trees, its fragrance of jasmine captivating the bees.

(50)  The cuckoos, intoxicated with joy, sing eternally in this forest, their voices blending with the melodious calls of the peacocks. (51)  The cuckoos sing in ecstasy, the peacocks cry out, and the swans echo the sounds of both. (52)  Here, the bees mimic the songs of the Kinnaris, while the cuckoo drowns out the sound of the veena played by the Siddhas. (53)  Here, the sound of the swans, surpassing the clang of anklets, fills the air, while the celestial nymphs dance, their movements mirroring the dance of the peacocks. (54)  Here, the loud sound of the celestial nymphs' anklets awakens the swans, sleeping with their young, in the sand dunes at dawn. (55)  Here, beautiful beds of flowers are created, adorned with moonstone pebbles, and these are the abodes of the gods, inaccessible to mortals. (56)  The sweet sounds of the drums, the buzzing of the bees, and the echoing calls of the peacocks create a symphony that makes it seem as if Kamadeva, the god of love, is leading his army to conquer the three worlds. (45)  Oh, what a wonder! The Nichula tree, blooming alongside the mango tree, enhances the beauty of this forest, adding the splendor of spring to the glory of the rainy season. (46)  Here, in this forest, the Madhavi creeper, adorning the forest with its delightful laughter, is flourishing today, adding to the beauty of the forest-goddess.

(53)  Here, the sound of the swans, surpassing the clang of anklets, fills the air, while the celestial nymphs dance, their movements mirroring the dance of the peacocks.

23. This forest, adorned with extremely beautiful features, generates joy, like that of heaven, in the hearts of the gods, always and forever. ||57||

Beyond the forest on the bank, a vast forest is visible, extremely difficult to traverse, filled with various trees, creepers, shrubs, and bushes. ||58||

In this forest, inaccessible even to sight, a herd of deer, of various species, is running wildly, terrified by the commotion of the army. ||59||

This forest, filled with frightened deer, appears to be enveloped in darkness, as if the very life of its inhabitants is in turmoil. ||60||

A herd of elephants, separated by the commotion of the army, is fleeing from the watery region on the bank of the Ganges, like darkness spreading in all directions. ||61||

This noble elephant king, protecting the herd, is slowly advancing, sniffing the directions, his trunk raised high, as if Mount Meru, along with the serpent king, is moving. ||62||

This massive serpent, with its upper body raised, is coming from the watery region, breathing heavily, as if measuring the height of the trees. ||63||

These young pythons, gathered in this bower, are breathing heavily, as if the very intestines of the forest are being expelled due to the commotion of the army. ||64||

This boar, a solitary wanderer, who has dug up the nearby land with his snout, and is extremely fierce, is blocking the path of the army. ||65||

This rhinoceros, resembling a small mountain, whose path has been blocked by the soldiers with stones, wood, etc., is clearly causing turmoil in the army. ||66||

These lions, with their manes, resembling flames of fire, are constantly emerging from this forest, as if their very life force is escaping. ||67||

These women, with great curiosity, are looking at their own beauty in the eyes of the deer and admiring their hair in the tails of the deer. || 78 || This forest, though disturbed by the army, appears undisturbed, where all creatures, including deer and birds, dwell without hindering each other. || 79 || O Lord, this intense sun does not bother us here, as we are always accompanied by the dense shade of the great trees in this forest. || 80 || These beautiful trees of the forest, with their dense shade, seem as if they were erected as mandapas by Vanalaxmi for your devotion. || 81 || These small ponds, filled with clear water and cooled by the trees on their banks, seem as if Vanalaxmi has established resting places to relieve fatigue. || 82 || O Lord, this forest seems like your army, for just as your army is filled with many bows and arrows, so too is this forest filled with trees of the bow and arrow species. Just as your army is filled with soldiers wielding swords, so too is this forest filled with rhinoceros and elephants. Just as your army is accompanied by a multitude of elephants, so too is this forest filled with a multitude of elephants. And just as the end of your army is not visible, so too is the end of this forest not visible. || 83 || Thus, as the charioteer continued to describe the abundance of the forest, Emperor Bharat crossed the forest land without even realizing its length. || 84 || At that time, the dust of the forest, raised by the impact of the hooves of the horses, spread in all directions, taking on the appearance of a curtain. || 85 || The armor of the horsemen, though covered with white cloth on top, appeared as if dyed with a saffron color due to being covered with the dust of the forest. || 86 || The women, weary from the journey, were struggling to wear the clothes that covered their breasts, which had become heavy due to the clinging forest dust. || 87 || The dust of the path, rising from the red earth,

The sun, blazing with intense brilliance, shone brightly in the midday sky, like a conquering king, its pure orb unmarred by any cloud. 89. Birds, their plumage shrunken by the scorching heat of autumn, sought refuge in the shade of trees by the lakeshore. 90. Swans, shielding their young with their wings, huddled together in clusters of lotuses, unable to bear the midday heat. 91. Wild elephants, their rutting frenzy cooled by the scorching sun, headed towards the lakes to bathe. 92. Elephants, their bodies scorched by the sun's rays, broke off branches to create shade for themselves, as if they were liberating the branches themselves. 93. A herd of wild boars, their bodies covered in mud, entered small ponds and lay down, piled on top of each other. 94. Swans, their bodies wrapped in strands of lotus fibers, shone brightly, as if they had taken refuge in a cage made of moonlight. 95. A young Chakravaka, unable to bear the heat, wore a thick, wide layer of algae all over its body, making it look like it was wearing a blue garment. 96. The king of swans, sheltered by a canopy of white lotus blossoms in the lotus forest, dived into the water with his female companions. 97. Swan chicks, their bellies full of lotus fragments and their bodies covered in lotus fibers, slept on beds of lotus leaves. 98. Thus, the autumn sun, with its intense heat, spread its scorching rays throughout the midday. 19.

Even though the sun was at its zenith, it still scorched the earth intensely. Indeed, even the middle ground of those with intense heat is scorching. (10)

The queens, their faces like lotuses, were adorned with a network of sweat droplets, like pearls. (101)

The beauty of the queens' faces, like lotus blossoms, was enhanced by the flow of sweat, like a stream of nectar. (102)

The faces of the queens, dripping with sweat, shone like lotuses covered in dew. (103)

The lotus-like faces of the queens were adorned with sweat droplets, like melted pearls decorating their hair. (104)

The charioteers, driving their chariots, had foamy mouths, their horses' hooves slipping on the hot ground, even though the sun was at its zenith. (105)

The horses, with their short, round hooves, smooth fur, tall stature, and broad backs, moved swiftly like the wind. (106)

The horses, with their great speed, their chests heaving, their nostrils flaring, and their manes flowing, moved swiftly. (107)

The horses, with their high foreheads, pure swirls, and swiftness like the mind, moved quickly on the narrow path. (108)

The horses, filled with strength, speed, and grace, moved swiftly, as if disdaining to touch the earth. (109)

Even faster than the horses and chariots, the birds flew, their feet like steps, leaping over thorns and stones. (110)

The Adipuranas, along with the Shakti warriors, the Yasti warriors, the Prasa warriors, the Dhanva warriors, and the Naistrimsika warriors, all rushed forward in a race, as if vying with each other.  ||111|| The warriors, whose armor was slightly moving from running ahead, were going so fast, as if they had grown wings and were flying. ||112|| "Move, run, get out of the way, don't block the path ahead!"  The warriors of the city shouted loudly, pushing those in front of them. ||113|| "Get out of the way of these horses, run away from these elephants, and get far away from these overturned chariots!" ||114|| "Lift these children from this crowd of people, and quickly move the horses away from the front of these elephants!" ||115|| "This wicked elephant is standing here blocking the path, and this chariot has overturned in the middle of the road due to the charioteer's mistake." ||116|| "Look, this camel, who has thrown off his load, has long lips and is very scared, is running backwards on the path, as if he wants to mock the people." ||117|| "Someone is holding a cloak in the middle of the path, trying to protect the woman from the inner palace who is falling from the frightened mule, but in doing so, he himself is falling." ||118|| "This young man, stunned by seeing the face of a prostitute, has fallen due to the push of the horse, but he is a fool, he still doesn't know 'I' have fallen." ||119|| "This old man, whose hair is dyed black with a special medicine, whose eyes are adorned with kohl, and who is following a prostitute, is behaving like a young man." ||120|| Thus, with these conversations about the journey, the soldiers, unaware of the fatigue of their horses, reached their camp, where the commander had already set up his camp. ||121||

## Twenty-Seventh Chapter

Then, with the shadow of the wives' faces obscuring the midday sun, the Emperor reached the edge of the camp.  [122]  He was seated on a divine chariot, shaded by a canopy of jewels.  The King did not feel the heat of the sun.  [123]  The King of Bharata did not even notice the path he had traversed, as he was engaged in conversation with the elders who were traveling alongside him.  [124]  Due to his divine power, he did not experience any jolting in his body from the movement of the chariot wheels, nor did he feel any fatigue from the chariot's speed.  [125]  The wind generated by the chariot's speed caused the long cloth of his banner to flutter, as if guiding the way for the army following behind.  [126]  The other kings, their bodies aching from the jolting of their chariots, reached the Emperor's chariot with great difficulty.  [127]  Those who wished to enter the camp with the Emperor covered the remaining distance quickly, their noble steeds carrying them forward.  [128]  From afar, the Emperor saw the tents and pavilions erected around the camp, their splendor mocking the palaces.  [129]  He saw the large, cloth-covered pavilions, supported by silver poles, which were like benevolent beings, relieving the suffering of the people.  [130]  People, seeing the large, rounded tops of the tents from afar, wondered if they were lotus flowers on the ground or flocks of swans.  [131]  The Emperor saw the various arrangements of tents and pavilions that had been set up for the accommodation of his vassals.  [132]  Seeing the thorny bushes surrounding the camps, he thought of them as thorns in his own kingdom, which was free from thorns.  [133]

**Verse 149:**
Like the shore of a vast ocean, with waves of attendants entering and exiting, creating a symphony of sounds. The great gatekeepers, busy in clearing the throng of people, with auspicious sounds echoing everywhere, making it seem as if Saraswati herself resides there.

**Verse 146:**
Even though it was familiar, it appeared as if it was something new, due to its unique splendor. King Bharat, seeing the courtyard of his palace, was filled with wonder.

**Verse 147:**
Who can describe the magnificence of this vast camp, where treasures are piled high, and countless jewels adorn the center?

**Verse 149 (Shārdūlavikrīḍita):**
Seeing his camp, adorned with Lakshmi's abode, the glorious Bharat, filled with contentment, crossed the threshold, ignoring the arrows (of his enemies). He entered his tent, where the guards were busy clearing the crowd, with flags fluttering, and everything perfectly arranged.

**Verse 150:**
There, in his tent, where auspicious objects were placed, and the air, carrying the cool drops of water from the Ganges, cleansed the altar, the Lord of wealth, Bharat, who had conquered the east, resided in comfort.

##  The Adipurana, Chapter 27: The Journey of King Bharata's Victory

**Verse 151:** When the tumult of the people in the kings' tents had subsided, and the horses, having drunk water, were grazing freely in the pavilions made of cloth, and the elephants, having bathed in the lakes on the banks of the Ganga, were tethered in the forests, then the victorious King Bharata's army seemed as if it had been there for a long time.

**Verse 152:** Just as the Devās worship the Jina, the Lord of the Assembly, who possesses supreme glory and sits in the Samavasarana, so too, the kings of the eastern region worshipped King Bharata, who possessed supreme wealth and sat in that pavilion, by offering him gifts of ancestral wealth, daughters, and other suitable things. Similarly, many other kings, who had been stopped by his army, abandoned their pride and bowed their heads from afar, paying homage to the Chakravartin.

**Thus ends the twenty-seventh chapter of the Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra, a collection of the stories of the sixty-three illustrious persons, composed by the venerable Jinaseṇācārya, which describes the journey of King Bharata's victory over the kings.**

The twenty-eighth chapter.  On the next day, having performed all the morning rituals, the Chakravarti Bharat set out, following the Chakra Ratna. ||1|| The Chakra Ratna, which destroys the power of the enemy and is itself not to be crossed by others, and the Danda Ratna, which punishes the enemies, both these Ratnas were in front of the Chakravarti's army. ||2|| The Chakra Ratna was protected by a thousand Devas, and the Danda Ratna was also protected by the same number of Devas. In fact, these two were the cause of the Chakravarti's victory, the rest of the material was only for show. ||3|| This time, the Chakravarti, whose body was competing with the Vijay Parvat, had set out riding the revered elephant named Vijay Parvat. ||4|| At that time, it seemed as if the Maharaja Bharat, who was eager to conquer the eastern direction up to the sea, was carrying the Vijay Parvat on his back by the power of his deception. ||5|| Just as Indra, adorned with a radiant crown, looks beautiful riding the Airavata elephant, so too Bharat, adorned with a radiant crown, looked beautiful riding the Vijay Parvat elephant, which was white like the clouds of autumn and given by the Devas. ||6|| The white umbrella held over Bharat's head was radiating such beauty as if it were the place of origin of glory. ||7|| A row of chamaras, as pure as the laughter of Lakshmi and as cool as the moonlight of autumn, was being carried around Maharaja Bharat. ||8|| The Chakravarti Bharat, riding the elephant named Vijay and shining with the brilliance of his victorious weapons, was the target of the glances of Vijay Lakshmi. Meaning - Vijay Lakshmi was looking at him. ||9|| Just as the Devas follow Indra, so too thousands of crowned kings were following Maharaja Bharat from all sides. ||10||

The Adipurana states that the journey must be undertaken immediately and the destination is the sea. The commanders urged the soldiers to hurry. (11) "Hurry! The king has departed, and today's camp is far away," the commanders' words stirred the army. (12) "Today we must reach the sea, camp at the gate of the Ganges, and conquer Magadha today, obtaining the treasure of waters." (13) "Today we will see the sea, the sea with its high waves. Today we will cross the sea, with the king's seal of authority." (14) With these words exchanged, the soldiers set out. The sound of the war drums, announcing the departure, filled the sky. (15) Then the army, stretching along the banks of the Ganges, marched on, as if measuring its own length. (16) The army resembled the Ganges, with its waving chowries like the geese on the river, its flags like the herons, and its horses like the waves. (17) The army marched towards the sea, like a second Ganges, for it contained the king, like the geese on the Ganges, and its progress was steady, like the flow of the river. (18) The army had conquered the Ganges, for the Ganges was contrary (filled with birds), but the army was not contrary (always obedient to the king's command). The Ganges was low (flowing towards low places), but the army was high (flowing towards the king, the highest man). The Ganges was trimarga (having three paths), but the army was not trimarga (it had only one path, the king's command). (19)

The twenty-eighth chapter: The army, adorned with flags, went towards the banks of the Ganga, as if cleaning the sky, which was covered with dust from the forest, with the clothes of the flags. ||20|| The armies of the great king Bharat crossed many rivers flowing towards the Ganga, which were like the state of a royal family, because just as the state of a royal family is difficult to enter, so are these rivers difficult to enter, and just as the state of a royal family is full of great acceptance, so are these rivers full of large crocodiles. ||21|| The wealthy king Bharat, while on his way, crossed many countries, rivers, mountains, forests, forts, and mines, etc. ||22|| Looking into the impenetrable forests, devoid of the movement of cows and other animals, the lord Bharat seemed to be trying for a moment to mend the holes in the earth. ||23|| On the way, many kings, frightened, were bowing to Bharat, thinking that this country belongs to the holder of the scepter. ||24|| The enemies of the great king Bharat, without any effort, became submissive on the way, so he never had to say, "O king, wear the jewel of the chakra, and O charioteer, drive the chariot." ||25|| Many other kings, desiring to conquer, were unable to fight Bharat in battle, so they were hitting his feet with their crowns under the pretext of prostration. ||26|| Just as the great king Bharat possessed power in his own kingdom, so he possessed power in the kingdoms of his enemies - he took away their land (विगत भूर्येषां तेषां भावः विभुत्वम्), and just as he delighted the kings in his own kingdom, so he delighted the earth in the kingdoms of his enemies. ||27||
The army was going by many routes. ||19||

The Adi Purana. There was no king on earth who was his equal in matters of diplomacy, etc. The six secrets were fulfilled in him alone, O Lord. ||28||  He honored the rulers of the provinces who had come to him from every country, and with his grace, he crossed many provinces. ||26||  His hand was never stained with trade, nor was his bow ever strung. He conquered the east solely by the power of his dominion. ||30||  He saw young cowherds in the outskirts of the Gokulas, their hair tied with forest vines, guarding the cows. ||31||  Their faces were covered with drops of sweat born of the labor of churning, they danced playfully, shaking their breasts as they churned the curd, their arms were weary from pulling the churning rope, their clothes were loose, the cloth on their breasts had slipped down, the lines of the three-fold rope were clearly visible on their thin bellies, the large drops of curd scattered over their bodies from the impact of the churning stick, creating a strange beauty, they had begun to sing along with the sound of the churning, their hair ties had come loose, and they looked like the flags of Cupid, and seeing the cowherd women in the courtyards of the cowsheds, churning the curd at will, and talking amongst themselves, the Lord Bharata was somewhat anxious. ||32-36||  The forest dwellers, who lived in the forest filled with wild elephants, saw the Lord and offered him the tusks of wild elephants and pearls. ||37||

The twenty-eighth chapter: Shyamagiri, whose body is not adorned with hair, whose belly is thin, whose body is covered with fluttering leaves like garments. ||38|| Those who are beautiful with their hair tied with the hair of the chamari cow, who have made garlands of gunja fruits their necklaces. ||39|| Those who are fragrant with the scent of musk deer, who are gathering the treasures of the forest with the desire to adorn themselves. ||40|| The daughters of the Pulinda tribe, who were amazed at the sight of the army, whose beauty was genuine, were seen by the Lord from afar. ||41|| Some of the Mlechcha kings offered the hair of the chamari cow, and some offered the musk deer's navel, to see the Lord. ||42|| There, the commander-in-chief, having received the order of the Chakravarti, subdued thousands upon thousands of fortresses of the Antapalas. ||43|| The Antapalas, offering rare jewels and precious wealth, paid homage to the Lord and accepted his command. ||44|| Then, traversing a long distance with his army, he reached the Ganga Gate, and after that, he reached the ocean, which was like himself, uncrossable. ||45|| He saw the water of the island, which was like the sweat of the ocean, surging out of the ocean and gathering in a deep place near the ocean. ||46|| From the beginning of the Yuga, when the rain fell at the beginning of the year, the water, due to the influence of time, had grown and reached the end of the island. ||47|| Because it was uncrossable, very large, and surrounded the entire island, the water, which had surged out of the ocean, became the Upsamudra. ||48|| Seeing that Upsamudra, Bharat, going by a pleasant path, stationed his army in the inner part of the Ganga. ||49||

A great torana (gateway) stood there, raised high. The army entered slowly, and settled down within. || 50 || There, the camp of the king was somewhat contracted in length, due to the arrangement of the tents, but the formation of the army was vast. || 51 || In that forest, like the Nandana forest, with trees that blocked the sun's rays, that army dwelt comfortably, with the cool breeze from the Ganges. || 52 || Even though this task of conquering the Magadha king was achievable through human effort, still, considering the divine aspect, he desired to perform a divine ritual. || 53 || He, who had consecrated weapons with mantras, fasted for three nights, his soul purified by the remembrance of mantras, pure, sitting on a pure bed. || 54 || Focused on all the duties of evening and morning, he performed the worship of the five supreme beings, with the priest presiding. || 55 || Having appointed the commander-in-chief to protect the army according to the rules, the king, armed with divine weapons, set out to conquer the salt sea. || 56 || There was no thought in his mind about what to take and what to leave behind, for the steadfastness of great souls is wondrous. || 57 || The king mounted the chariot named Ajit-jaya, filled with divine weapons, harnessed with divine horses that could traverse both land and water. || 58 || That chariot, dark green like leaves, with a banner marked with a wheel, was driven by divine charioteers, urged on by the divine whip. || 59 || Then, the priest, with auspicious words, blessed him, saying, "O king, may you be victorious!" || 60 || The army entered the forest, which was like the Nandana forest, through the gateway, which was like a great torana. || 49 || There was a great torana (gateway) there, raised high.

The gods residing in the ocean are within your sphere of enjoyment. This is your time to conquer them, the herald proclaimed loudly. ||62||

Then, accompanied by a few heroes, the Chakravarti Bharat ascended the altar of Ganga-dwar. ||63||

The Chakravarti did not consider that altar of Ganga-dwar merely as an entrance to the ocean, but also as the gateway to the fulfillment of his task. ||64||

The ascent of the Chakravarti, adorned with auspicious attire, onto that altar shone like the ascent of the victorious Lakshmi onto the altar of her marriage. ||65||

Considering that altar as the altar of his own courtyard, Bharat cast his gaze upon the ocean with the wisdom of an artificial river. Meaning: Due to his overwhelming strength, Bharat considered the altar of Ganga as if it were the altar of his own courtyard, and the vast ocean as if it were a small canal. ||66||

He ascended that great, long altar as if he were ascending upon his own vow, and he considered the ocean as if he had already reached its other shore. ||67||

From that altar, he saw the ocean, where waves were constantly rising, crossing the shores, being whipped by the wind, and with their deep sounds, it seemed as if they were crying out in fear of being crossed. With their arms of waves, they were releasing small particles of water containing jewels, which seemed as if they were offering an arghya to Bharat, mixed with pearls and akshatas. That ocean had countless conch shells, it had conquered all the islands, it was boundless, no one could cross it, and no one could disturb it, therefore it was mimicking the group of Bharat's army, because it also had countless conch shells to be blown, it had also conquered all the islands - brought them under its control, it was also boundless, it was also uncrossable and undisturbed by others. That ocean was like someone suffering from epilepsy (epilepsy)

It was like a sick man, for just as an epileptic is troubled by the frothy waves, so too was the ocean troubled by the frothy waves. Just as an epileptic cannot be held by anyone, so too could the ocean not be held by anyone. And just as an epileptic does not remain still in any place, so too did the ocean not remain still in any place - it was restless due to the waves. The ocean suddenly made a deep sound, it was restless without reason, and whirlpools formed in it without reason. Therefore, its condition was worse than that of a very unstable person, because even a very unstable person suddenly starts to make sounds, shouts, trembles without reason, and starts to whirl around, running here and there. The ocean seemed to be laughing because of the rising foam, it seemed to be dancing because of the tides, it seemed to be moving because of the waves, and it seemed to be intoxicated because of the swaying. Or, the ocean seemed like a serpent, for just as a serpent has jewels, so too did the ocean have jewels. Just as a serpent has potent poison, so too did the ocean have potent poison, that is, water. Just as a serpent is fearsome because of its hissing, so too was the ocean fearsome because of its hissing. Just as a serpent has shining scales, so too did the ocean have shining waves. And just as a serpent is restless, so too was the ocean restless. Or, the ocean seemed as if it had a cold (runny nose) from drinking too much water, and therefore it was sneezing with thousands of sounds. Or, the ocean seemed like a glutton, for just as a glutton eats a lot and then burps because of the excess food, so too did the ocean drink the water of all the rivers and then burped with sounds because of the excess water. The ocean was never satisfied with the water from its deep, vast belly, and therefore it seemed to have opened its mouth up to the palate. Meaning - The ocean seemed like a man who is never satisfied, even after eating a lot, because just as a man who is not satisfied keeps his mouth open because of thirst, even after eating a lot, so too did the ocean keep its mouth open because of thirst, even after drinking a lot of water - the rivers

## The Twenty-Eighth Chapter

The ocean, being vast in all directions, was making a sound, hence it was 'Ravana'. It had submerged many mountains within its waters, hence it was 'Achal Graha'. It instilled fear in all beings, hence it was 'Vibhishana'. It was extremely large, hence it was 'Atikaya', and very deep, hence it was 'Mahodar'. Thus, it appeared as if it were a group of Rakshasas.

The ocean, with its wave-like arms, was constantly striking the shore's altar, as if it were pushing and making its own 'Samaryad' known. It was transgressing the shore with its mountain-like, towering waves, as if it were not contained within itself due to its union with the river-like women.

Its body was filled with numerous wave-like contractions, hence it appeared like an old man. Or, the ocean appeared like a 'Prithuk', a child, because just as a child crawls on the earth on its knees, so too does the ocean crawl on the earth with its waves. Just as a child slides, so too does it slide with its waves. Just as a child is very beautiful, so too is it very beautiful.

Moreover, the ocean was filled with crocodiles and other aquatic creatures, and was extremely terrifying. Or, the ocean was clearly a 'Jadashaya', a fool, because despite its beauty, it was not fit for consumption. That which is beautiful is certainly fit for consumption, but the ocean was not so. (Because its beauty, its saltiness, made it unfit for anyone to drink.) Despite its depth, it was not stable. That which is deep, which has patience, is certainly stable, but the ocean was not so. (Because its depth, its vastness, made it restless with waves.) And despite its importance, it kept shouting and cursing. That which is important, which is great, remains very calm, it does not shout, but the ocean was not so. (Because despite its great size, it made sounds due to the impact of the waves.) For all these reasons, it is clear that it was a 'Jadashaya'. (Because it was filled with water, 'Jala' being in its 'Aashay'.)

Although the ocean did not have the association of alcohol, it was 'Aarudha Madhu Vikriya', meaning it was carrying the intoxication and madness caused by alcohol. Similarly, although it did not have lustful fever, it was 'Udrikta Kandarpa', meaning it was carrying intense lustful desires.

**Meaning:** In this verse, there are several layers of meaning:

1. **Ravana:** The ocean is making a sound, hence it is 'Ravana'. This is a play on words, as 'Ravana' also means 'the one who makes a sound'. Another meaning is 'Dashaasya', the ten-headed demon.
2. **Achal Graha:** The ocean has taken in mountains, hence it is 'Achal Graha'. This is a play on words, as 'Achal Graha' also means 'one who takes in mountains'. Another meaning is a Rakshasa who takes in mountains.
3. **Vibhishana:** The ocean is terrifying, hence it is 'Vibhishana'. This is a play on words, as 'Vibhishana' also means 'the terrifying one'. Another meaning is Ravana's brother.
4. **Atikaya:** The ocean is extremely large, hence it is 'Atikaya'. This is a play on words, as 'Atikaya' also means 'the one with an extremely large body'. Another meaning is a demon with a large body.
5. **Mahodar:** The ocean is very deep

The Twenty-Eighth Chapter

Very deep, like a king, with many enjoyers on its shore. Like a great king, it is high, with boundaries. (11) It protects many inner islands, like a fortress, impregnable. (12) Filled with roaring, deep, sky-reaching waves, like a servant, it is filled with water. (13) With colored, moving, turbulent, and changing waves, like a possessed man, it is noisy and whirling. (14) Its bottom is painted with rays of light, its water is adorned with pearls, and it is full of crocodiles, making it both beautiful and frightening. (15)

The river, rich in jewels, is ancient and long-lived. The ocean, like a king, is vast and eternal. (16) 

The ocean was not satisfied, just as a wicked king is surrounded by water (inert) i.e. foolish people, so too was the ocean constantly surrounded by water (water). And just as a wicked king scorns the guru (venerable sage), so too did the ocean scorn the guru (heavy objects) i.e. it drowned them. Or, the ocean seemed like a good king, because just as a good king is endowed with sattva (strength), so too was the ocean endowed with sattva (aquatic creatures). Just as a good king is very deep, so too was the ocean very deep. Just as many enjoyers (kings) are present near a good king, so too were many enjoyers (snakes) present on the shore of the ocean. Just as a good king's position is high, so too was the ocean's position high, i.e. its water was rising above the air. And just as a good king is endowed with maryada (appropriate conduct) that comes from his lineage, so too was the ocean endowed with maryada (boundaries). The ocean was protecting the many inner islands that resided within it. These inner islands seemed like impregnable and unstealable fortresses. The extremely deep ocean seemed as if it were filled with water by constantly rising, roaring, and sky-reaching clouds, like servants. Or, the ocean seemed like a possessed man, because just as a possessed man crawls, walks, is agitated, jumps high, and turns around, so too was the ocean crawling, walking, agitated, jumping high, and turning around, i.e. sometimes it was waving this way, sometimes that way. And just as a possessed man is endowed with ujjrumbha (rising yawns), so too was the ocean endowed with ujjrumbha (rising waves). Just as a possessed man makes sounds, so too was the ocean making sounds. And just as a possessed man trembles, so too was the ocean trembling from the wind. The bottom of the ocean was painted with the rays of jewels, its water was adorned with pearls, and it was full of crocodiles, making it both beautiful and frightening.

The Adipurana

The ocean, like a Siddhalaya, is manifest and unmanifest, a place of nectar. It is boundless, indestructible, and unsurpassed. It is serene, unperturbed, and imperishable.

Sometimes it appears as if it is adorned with the brilliance of ruby and sapphire, reflecting the hues of twilight clouds. At other times, it seems to be enveloped in deep darkness, illuminated by the rays of blue gems. The spread of emerald brilliance creates the illusion of seaweed, while coral shoots impart a saffron glow. The opening of conch shells reveals pearls floating within, making it appear as if the sky is laughing with constellations. Near the shore, the water shimmers with the radiance of all gems, resembling a rainbow drawn across the celestial canvas.

The Chakravarti saw this vast ocean, overflowing with countless gems, as an unparalleled treasure.

Seeing the twenty-eighth Tirthankara, the great one, the wise, the one without possessions, considered him, with just a glance, as insignificant as the hooves of a singer. ||103|| Then, to fulfill his desire, he bowed to the perfected ones and, with a loud voice, urged the charioteer, "Drive the chariot quickly!" ||104|| The chariot, driven by horses with loosened reins and speed like the mind, was swiftly moving through the salt ocean, like a ship. ||105|| The chariot precedes the desire, or the desire precedes the chariot. Thus, with such potential speed, the chariot was moving swiftly through the ocean. ||106|| Was it made firm by the water-stopping power, or did it reach the land? Because the horses of the Chakravarti were pulling the chariot through the water, thinking it was land. ||107|| Just as the sound of the wheels was heard outside the water, so it was heard inside the water. And just as the horses ran outside the water, so they ran inside the water. Ah! How wondrous is the merit of the Chakravarti! ||108|| Even though they were being drenched by large waves, the horses were pulling the chariot without any effort. They were not troubled by the waves, but rather their effort was being relieved. ||109|| The mass of water, rising up towards the sky due to the impact of the chariot wheels, brought heaviness even to the flag's cloth. This is natural, for such is the nature of water. In Sanskrit poetry, there is no distinction between "ḍ" and "l," so by reading "jalaanām" as "jaḍaanām," the fourth line should be interpreted as: "It is the nature of foolish people to bring heaviness, i.e., foolishness, to others." ||110|| The angaraaga (paste) applied to the horses' bodies did not become wet from the sweat produced by their exertion, but only from the splashes of water raised by the speed of their hooves. ||111|| For a moment, the ocean water, split in two by the assembly of the chariot's parts, seemed as if it were laying down a path, like a thread, for the future Chakravartis like Sagara. ||112|| The chariot, driven by the charioteer, reached the desired land. The desire, too, was fulfilled, driven by the meritorious charioteer. ||113||

The chariot of the Lord, driven by the righteous charioteer Gaya, stood within the ocean, having traveled many yojanas. It was as if the ocean had risen up and swallowed the horses, like a crocodile. ||114||

The chariot, having traveled twelve yojanas, stood in the middle of the ocean. The king, with his hand on the chariot's bow, took up the Karmuka bow. ||115||

When the bow, with its vibrating string and vajra-like shaft, was strung, the world was filled with doubt about its own survival. ||116||

The vibrating string of the bow, resounding in all directions, disturbed the ocean, filled with swarms of fish, as they scattered in fear. ||117||

"Does this king wish to destroy this ocean, or the entire world?" Thus, the Vidyadharas, filled with apprehension, stood in the sky for a moment. ||118||

Standing in a praiseworthy posture, the king placed an infallible arrow, called Amogha, on the bow, which was curved but strong and capable of straight action. ||119||

"I am Bharata, the Chakravarti, son of Vrishabhadeva. All the Vyantara Devas who reside in my domain shall be subject to me." Thus, the arrow, bearing these words in clear script, was released by the Chakravarti, like a swift messenger, heading towards the east. ||120-121||

The arrow, with its thunderous roar, which had conquered the sound of the thunderbolt, caused turmoil in the army of the Magadha king, as it descended from the sky to his abode. ||122||

"Has the ocean been disturbed by the wind of the Kalpanta, or has a thunderbolt fallen with a loud roar, or is there an earthquake?" Thus, the Vyantara Devas, whose minds were filled with anxiety, stood ready, surrounding the Magadha king. ||123-124||

O Gods, an arrow has fallen in our assembly hall. This disturbance is due to nothing else. ||125||

Gaya, the righteous charioteer, inspired their desire, which was then fulfilled. ||113||

The chariot of Maharaja Bharata stood within the ocean, having traveled many yojanas. It was as if the ocean had risen up and swallowed the horses, like a crocodile. ||114||

When the chariot stood within the ocean, having traveled twelve yojanas, the Chakravarti, filled with anger, took up his bow. ||115||

The bow, with its vibrating string and vajra-like shaft, was strung by the Chakravarti. At that moment, the world was filled with doubt about its own survival. ||116||

The vibrating string of the bow, resounding in all directions, disturbed the ocean, filled with swarms of fish, as they scattered in fear. ||117||

"Does this king wish to destroy this ocean, or the entire world?" Thus, the Vidyadharas, filled with apprehension, stood in the sky for a moment. ||118||

Standing in a praiseworthy posture, the king placed an infallible arrow, called Amogha, on the bow, which was curved but strong and capable of straight action. ||119||

"I am Bharata, the Chakravarti, son of Vrishabhadeva. All the Vyantara Devas who reside in my domain shall be subject to me." Thus, the arrow, bearing these words in clear script, was released by the Chakravarti, like a swift messenger, heading towards the east. ||120-121||

"O Lord, we are ready to retaliate against whoever, be it a Deva or a Danava, has sent this arrow." || 126 ||
Thus, the valiant protectors, having informed their Lord, the Magadha, were told by him, "Be silent! There is no benefit in such heroic words." || 127 ||
"You are the Devas under my command, and I am the Magadha. Have you ever heard of me tolerating an enemy? " || 128 ||
"A man who bears his life, stained with defeat, is not considered a man by virtue of his qualities, but only by his gender." || 129 ||
"He is a painted man or a straw man who, without any qualities, merely wants to be called a man." || 130 ||
"He who purifies his lineage and birth through his valor is truly a man. On the other hand, a man who calls himself a hero merely by name, it would be better if he were not born on this earth." || 131 ||
"We are called Devas only by conquering our enemies, not by merely roaming around at will. Therefore, our wealth should always be obtained through victory over our enemies." || 132 ||
"He who worships another by offering him things like ropes, elephants, horses, and royal insignia like umbrellas and fans, his wealth is for the enjoyment of others. I consider such wealth to be a mockery." || 133 ||
"This king, who shoots arrows, wants wealth from me. For this, I will give him death along with war." || 134 ||

The Adi Purana
From the beginning, the words of the great sage, like a blazing fire, were uttered. The Magadha king, suppressing his anger, spoke with a smile. ||136||
Then the gods, who had seen the lineage, said to the lord, "Calm your anger. The position of a king is established by the learned and the elders." ||137||
The words you have spoken are timely, full of meaning, measured, extensive, free from anxiety, and profound. Such words are not spoken by fools. ||138||
It is true that the proud cannot bear defeat, but opposition from the strong is also the cause of defeat. ||139||
It is true that one should protect one's honor even at the cost of life and wealth, but how can the wise obtain that honor without the protection of a powerful lord? ||140||
The acquisition of what is not obtained and the protection of what is obtained, both are difficult to achieve without the support of a conquering king. ||141||
Even among the strong, there are those who are stronger and wiser. Therefore, one should not be proud, thinking, "I am strong." ||142||
One who desires success should not act without considering anything. Therefore, one should investigate from where this arrow came and whose it is. ||143||
We have heard many times the true words of the liberated souls who will reside and take avatars in this Bharatavarsha along with the Chakravartis. ||144||
This arrow, which signifies victory, must belong to the Chakravarti, for the light that destroys dense darkness can only be found in the sun. ||145||
Or, it is pointless to doubt. This arrow belongs to the Chakravarti, for the string of letters of his name is clearly inscribed on it. ||146||

The twenty-eighth chapter. Having worshipped the arrow with fragrant garlands, Akshata, etc., we should go and offer it to him, obeying his command. ||17|| O Magadha, do not be swayed by any kind of delusion, and be sure to carry out this task, for it is not right for you, a resident of his country, to oppose him. ||15|| Therefore, O Deva, it is useless to be angry, for there is no peace in enmity with the Chakravarti. Who can be happy swimming against the strong current of a great river? ||149|| If it is the policy to keep a powerful man on your side, then the Chakravarti should be pleased today, for wise people believe that a humble attitude like a bent reed is the way to overcome suffering in the case of great men. ||150|| Worship of the worthy brings progress to beings in both this world and the next, while transgression of the worship of the worthy, i.e., disrespect, binds one to sin in both worlds. ||151|| Thus, by the words of those Devas, he, the Magadha Deva, who had been somewhat enlightened at that moment, accepted their words, saying, "I did not know this." ||152|| At that time, his mind was filled with some confusion, some fear, some apprehension, some anxiety, and some enlightenment. ||153|| Then, after a short while, his mind became clear and calm, the anger having subsided, and she looked at everything that had happened before and after. ||154|| This is the first Chakravarti among the Chakravartis, Bharat, whose command cannot be transgressed. We should worship him in every way and obey his command with respect. ||155|| He is the Chakravarti, the ultimate being, and the son of the Jagadguru, Vrishabhadeva. Each of these three qualities is worthy of worship, so what can be said of him who possesses all three? ||156|| Having decided thus, the Magadha Deva, accompanied by many excellent Devas who were in a state of confusion, immediately set out to see the Chakravarti by the aerial path. ||157|| 

Page #68:
---------------------------
The Adipurana, adorned with the rays of the moon-like crown, reached that land where the Chakravarti resided, in a moment.  [158]  The Magadha, placing the arrow adorned with jewels before him, bowed to the Lord and said, "O Arya, accept me, consider me your own." [159]  "O Bhadra, we ignorant ones did not arrive at the moment of the Chakra's birth, forgive us this great offense, we beg you again and again." [160]  "O Sriman, by the touch of the dust of your feet, not only this ocean has been purified, but we too have been purified by the service of your lotus feet." [161]  "O Lord, though these jewels are priceless and even rare in heaven, may they be useful for placing beneath your treasures." [162]  "This most radiant garland, woven with divine pearls not born from boar, conch, bamboo, or elephant, may it attain veneration by its embrace of your chest, and these sparkling kundalas, may they attain purity by their association with your ears." [163-164]  Thus, the Magadha presented the garland and the two divine kundalas to the Lord, adorned with the essence of the three worlds, as if they were one. [165]  The Magadha, whose mind was filled with joy, worshipped the Lord of Jewels with jewels, and having received honor from him, he departed to his own place with his consent. [166]  Then, standing there, the Lord, looking at the ocean with its islands, was somewhat astonished, for indeed, the salt ocean was full of wonders. [167]  Then, out of curiosity, the charioteer, scattering the flower-like rays of his teeth, said to the Lord who was looking at the ocean: [168]  "This ocean, encompassing the earth, with its surging, turbulent waves, its sparkling jewels, its countless conch shells, its roaring sound, is like your rain, it desires to bestow endless joy." [169]

This ocean, adorned with delicate droplets of water, resembling the soft rays of the moon, seems to be laughing, as if introducing itself to the directions, or perhaps spreading its fame in every direction. || 170 ||

Here, the ocean, filled with the sound of countless conch shells, adorned with scattered pearls, dark like a bumblebee, and teeming with the constellations of Makara, Meena, and Makara, conquers the sky with its stars. Elsewhere, it seeks to conquer the lineage of kings, for just as the lineage of kings is filled with the multitude of kings, so too is this water filled with the multitude of serpents. Just as the lineage of kings is exalted, so too is this water exalted. Just as the lineage of kings is of the highest standing, so too is this water of the highest standing. And just as the lineage of kings is filled with valiant warriors, so too is this water valiant. || 171 ||

Here, the water of the Ganga, flowing from the Himalayas, with a brilliance like the autumn clouds, enters, and from the other side, the sweet water of the Sindhu enters. Yet, even with the influx of water, its satisfaction is not complete. This is because a reservoir (which is filled with water, and is also foolish) is never satisfied with the collection of water (which is also foolish). Meaning: Just as a reservoir, being foolish, is not satisfied with the collection of foolish people, so too is a reservoir, filled with water, not satisfied with the collection of water. || 172 ||

Spreading throughout its belly, the large crocodiles, like moving mountains, nourished by the water, are like its sons. Surrounded by waves, they clash with each other and dwell together. || 173 ||

The Adi Purana says: Water is the wealth of this ocean, rivers that carry rasa (water, essence, or love) are its wives, aquatic creatures are its sons, and sand is its jewels. Thus, this ocean, though possessing little wealth, still bears the grand name of Mahasagara. This is indeed a wonder! (174)

The serpents, whose bodies are stained with the smoke of their breaths, whose hoods are adorned with shining jewels, who move in circles, and who suddenly become angry, all display the splendor of the Alaat Chakra in this ocean. (175)

This ocean, whose waters are touched by the cool feet of the moon, suddenly leaps towards the sky, as if in anger, with a deep roar, using the waves as a ruse to avenge itself. For, great men cannot tolerate humiliation. (176)

There are countless beautiful islands in this ocean, like fortresses in the middle of the sea, where the celestial beings, accompanied by their beloved consorts, play and enjoy themselves. (177)

Many waves reside in this ocean, all pushing against each other. (173)

**Mālinī Vṛtta**

This ocean, agitated by the wind, with its waves surging and roaring, is striking the shore-forest. It seems to be angry, as if saying, "There is no way out for me." || 178 ||

You, O mountains, are of great importance, and yet you strike us with your feet. What is the use of your height? Are you not able to cross us? Are you not as deep as we are? Thus, the ocean speaks, "Surely, I am the king of the mountains." || 179 ||

Here, this young snake, mistaking the whale's open mouth for its burrow, runs towards it with joy. The whale, seeing the snake in its throat, does not swallow it out of compassion. || 180 ||

This group of fish, seeing the water filled with the rays of the great gem, mistaking it for flesh, rushes towards it. Then, suddenly, they see it as fire and retreat. || 181 ||

**Verse 184:**
This water of the ocean, flowing like serpents, is seen within, with millions of shining gems. It appears like a great blue mansion, adorned with countless lamps, dispelling the darkness.

**Verse 185:**
The intoxicated peacocks dance, while the wind blows, creating a sound like the *puṣkara* (a musical instrument). The celestial maidens, adorned with garlands, play merrily on the edge of the island, accompanied by the sound of the ocean.

**Verse 186:**
The dark blue ocean, roaring loudly, adorned with sparkling gems on the raised hoods of serpents, embraces the clouds. It is clear that the ocean, like the clouds, cannot leave its place during the rainy season.

**Verse 187:**
Behold, on the shore of the ocean, these rows of forests, their heat calmed, their waters spread out, adorned with flowers, and washed by the splashing drops of waves, like blue garments scattered with flowers.

**Verse 188:**
The deer, nourished by the sweet lotus, roam for a long time around the lakes, enjoying the peaceful and naturally pleasant abode on the shore.

**Verse 189:**
Seeing the forest fire, the deer, terrified, run swiftly along the shore, their golden bodies shining with fear.

**Verse 183:**
These serpents, with their jeweled hoods raised high, looking towards the sky, seem as if the great ocean is holding a cluster of lamps in its vast, wave-like hands.

This ocean, attracting the river-women with their beauty, and embracing them again and again with its waves, whose garments of water are somewhat loosened, never becomes satisfied with enjoyment, for the very lustful never becomes satisfied in this world. ||190||
These shores, which have been cleansed by the sprinkling of water from the clouds, and which are constantly adorned with the gifts of flowers falling from the creepers, and which are fit for the enjoyment of the gods, are here adorned with waves that rise up in a scattered manner. ||191||
In this forest, filled with flowers, which laughs at the beauty of the gardens of heaven, the wind blows gently from the edge of the forest of Mandara trees, and the celestial nymphs, who have begun to sing a little, walk gracefully along the shores of the ocean, lifting and placing their feet. ||192||
Here, a large fish, born in this water, is coming quickly from afar to attack other fish born in this water, despising them. And another large fish, swallowing the large fish like mountains, stands ready to fight with the first large fish. ||193||
Here, this serpent is dragging a large fish from the water to the land, and is holding it firmly with the desire to fight. But even though he is strong, he cannot conquer, for there is no victory for equals in battle, and there is no other course of action for equals in this world. ||194||
Seeing the shining golden places, this herd of deer, fearing a fire, is running very quickly back to the shore, towards the earth. ||189||

The ocean water, churned by wild elephants, resembles a forest with wild elephants roaring loudly. It adorns the shore with the sound of drums and washes the shore clean with its surging waves. (195)

The ocean water, filled with the bodies of fish, scattered with broken shells, emitting a harsh sound, and holding the underworld in its depths, appears terrifying. The water, touched by snakes, creates an illusion of waves, making it seem even more formidable. (196)

Here, the wind, shaking the forest, brings cool drops of water and carries the fragrance of flowers from the trees. There, the fierce wind, roaring with the sound of waves, blows fiercely, shaking the bodies of large fish. (197)

The shores of this ocean are adorned with beautiful waves, adorned with pearls, and overflowing with the wealth of flowers. Deities, accompanied by their beautiful consorts, enjoy the shade of the trees on the shore, longing for the beauty of other heavenly realms. (198)

These aquatic creatures, like crocodiles, consider this ocean, filled with infinite wealth, as their father and, like sons, fight amongst themselves, clamoring for a larger share of the wealth, shouting in anger, as if to claim their inheritance. Alas, such wealth is a curse! (199)

This ocean, with its endless wealth, is a testament to the fact that there is no escape from the cycle of birth and death, even for those who have attained liberation. (200)

## The Twenty-Eighth Chapter

The belly of the ocean, churning like boiling metal in a vajra cauldron, is a spectacle of bubbling water and surging air, rising from the depths through countless subterranean holes.  The ocean's interior, though constantly plundered of its many jewels by men, remains perpetually hot, for the loss of wealth kindles a fierce inner fire even in the hearts of the greatest. (201)

O Auspicious One, just as you are filled with wonders, so too is this ocean.  Just as you possess precious jewels, so too does this ocean.  Just as all beings in the world depend on you for their sustenance, so too do they depend on this ocean.  Just as you are of a profound nature, so too is this ocean.  Just as you possess immense power, so too does this ocean.  Just as you are free from laziness, so too is this ocean.  This ocean truly emulates you.  The only difference is that it is filled with the abundance of water, while you are filled with the abundance of foolish (jaḍ) humans. (202)

Thus, when the charioteer described the ocean's magnificent splendor, Emperor Bharat was filled with great joy and soon desired to return to his camp. (203)

## The Twenty-Eighth Chapter

**The Lion's Play**

There, cheered by the auspicious sounds of "Victory! Victory!" and the joyous cries of the captives, King Bharata, having returned from his campaign, reached the great gate of his camp.  He was welcomed by the members of his family and the courtesans, who showered him with auspicious grains and blessings.  Thus, the Lord of Treasures, Bharata, whose banners fluttered in the wind, entered his own tent.  [20]

"Bring auspicious grains, Siddha and Sesha grains, for this King, who has conquered the ocean without a scratch on his body!"  "Give blessings!"  "Come quickly and stand before him!"  Such was the clamor that arose in the camp at that time.  [210]

"May you live long, O King!"  "May you prosper!"  "May you conquer your enemies!"  "May you conquer the earth!"  "May you live long and fulfill all your desires!"  Thus, the elders showered King Bharata with hundreds of auspicious blessings.  [211]

"May you conquer your enemies, O King!"  "May you rule the earth!"  "May you live long!"  Although King Bharata had already conquered his enemies and obtained the fourteen jewels, he was still blessed with these words.  Even though he was already long-lived, he was again blessed with the words, "May you live long, O King!"  Thus, the people, understanding the auspiciousness of the occasion, repeated these words, even though the actions had already been accomplished.  [212]

It is only right that King Bharata, whose chariot is drawn by virtue, should return here without any obstacles, having crossed the vast and boundless ocean and achieved victory through skillful means.  For what can hinder a man who is blessed with pure virtue?  [213]

## The Adipurana: A Translation with Jain Terms Preserved

**Verse 214:**

The valiant Bharata Chakravarti, desiring to conquer, crossed the ocean, where tides rise and waves are whipped by the wind. He swiftly conquered the Magadha king. What is unconquerable in the world when one possesses such immense merit? Nothing!

**Verse 215:**

Bharata Chakravarti, bearing the weight of great fortune, crossed the ocean, which is difficult to traverse, without any hindrance. He brought the earth, whose boundary is the ocean, under his control. There is no better means than merit for achieving desired results.

**Verse 216:**

Bharata Chakravarti, wielding the chakra weapon, whose power is terrifying to enemies, crossed the ocean teeming with fearsome crocodiles. He brought the Magadha king, who is not subject to anyone else, under his control. There is no better means of subjugation in the world than merit.

**Verse 217:**

Merit becomes like land in water, and like water on land, quickly dispelling all suffering. Merit is a third refuge, in both water and land, protecting from fear. Therefore, O noble ones, practice merit as taught by the Jinas.

**Verse 218:**

Merit is the supreme refuge, insurmountable in times of adversity. Merit bestows wealth upon the poor. Merit brings happiness to those who desire it. Therefore, O virtuous ones, accumulate this jewel of merit, as taught by the Jinas.

**Verse 219:**

The first merit arises from worshipping the Jinas. The second merit arises from giving to the deserving. The third merit arises from observing vows. The fourth merit arises from fasting. Thus, those who desire merit should strive for these four types of merit.

**Verse 213:**

What remains insurmountable for humans? Nothing!

## The Twenty-Eighth Parva

Thus, the Chakravarti Bharat, praised by the assembly of people for the auspicious benefits gained from the ripening of his good deeds, arrived at the assembly hall. There, amidst the circle of kings, he sat upon a magnificent royal throne, like Indra himself. || 220 ||

**Harini**

As the wind, gently blowing, stirred the shore-side forest, breaking through the clusters of red Ashoka blossoms, the Lord, remembering the Jina, resided happily with his army, encamped along the banks of the Ganga, receiving praise and blessings for his conquest of the ocean. || 221 ||

Thus ends the Twenty-Eighth Parva, named "The Description of the Victory at the Gate of the Eastern Ocean," in the Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra, a collection of the Mahāpurāṇa, composed by the venerable Jinaseṇācārya, known as the Ārṣa. || 28 ||

The Thirty-First Chapter

-

The Chakravartin, Bharat, having performed the worship of the Jina, the bestower of all desired objects, set out to conquer the southern region, following the seashore. [1]

As he journeyed, the sound of the drums, like thunder, mingled with the trumpets, drowning out even the roar of the ocean. [2]

The sound of the departure drums, mingled with the trumpeting of elephants, shook all directions and the hearts of the enemies. [3]

The victory flags, raised by the wind, fluttered in the air, as if beckoning the waves of the ocean, like the waves of victory. [4]

On one side (south) was the salt ocean, and on the other (north) was the inland sea. In between, the army of the Chakravartin marched, looking like a third ocean. [5]

Elephants, horses, chariots, foot soldiers, gods, and celestial beings - these six types of forces of the Chakravartin spread out, filling the space between heaven and earth. [6]

The Danda-ratna led the way, followed by the Chakra-ratna. The army marched comfortably on the path cleared by these two. [7]

The Chakra of the Chakravartin was like a thunderbolt, destroying the enemy forces. The Danda was like another Yama-danda, punishing those who deserved punishment. [8]

The Emperor Bharat, following the seashore, marched along the edge of the ocean, his army filling the directions with its presence. [9]

Dragging his invincible army along the seashore, the Chakravartin Bharat planted his command, like a creeper, on the heads of the mountains, like kings. [10]

The movement of the Chakravartin was like the movement of his generals, for as soon as he wished to move, his army moved. [11]

The thirty-ninth chapter has passed, and those who were confused are now filled with fear, thinking, "He has departed!" Those who were enemies, upon hearing, "He has arrived," bowed down in submission.  ||12||

Just as a tree standing against the powerful current of a great river is uprooted, so too, any king who stood against this powerful Chakravarti, who did not bow down in humility, was destroyed, his lineage eradicated. ||13||

Bharata, whose only delight was in his own prowess, who could not even tolerate his own reflection in a mirror, how could he tolerate his enemies? ||14||

Some of his enemies, upon hearing the sound of his army, fled far away, adopting the ways of the deer. ||15||

And some, great and powerful kings, driven by fear, abandoned their kingdoms, leaving behind their umbrellas, whisks, and other royal insignia, just as snakes, shedding their skin, abandon their coiled bodies. ||16||

Just as wicked people are lifted up by the power of mantras and thrown into pits, so too, Bharata, by the power of his mantras (his counsel with his ministers), uprooted many wicked, pleasure-seeking kings and cast them into fortresses, replacing them with noble kings. ||17||

Adipurana - Many kings who had no other refuge and desired to end their suffering took refuge in the shade of the feet of Bharata, which was cool and pleasant. ||18|| Just as the approaching summer destroys the leaves of trees and causes the absence of their shade, so too, the approaching Bharata destroyed the chariots, horses, and elephants of many kings, and caused the absence of their splendor. ||19|| As soon as the great king Bharata approached, the energy of the enemy kings was extinguished, their heavy breaths began to come, and they were agitated within, so they were attaining the state of a dying man. ||20|| The one who desired to be an enemy of Bharata had already perished, so it is right, because what moth desiring to extinguish fire can ever remain safe? ||21|| The great king Bharata had taken away all the wealth, jewels, and chariots of the enemies, and thus he had clearly made the entire group of enemies, wealthless. ||22|| The kings who had offered all their wealth and bowed down to the Chakravarti, although they were enemies before, later became great officials. ||23|| The earth, which was previously terrified by the army of Bharata, now became fearless by satisfying Bharata with its wealth. ||24|| Many kings born in noble families had given their ancestral wealth to Bharateshwar and regained their kingdoms, so it is right, because those kings are like a 'kulyā' (canal) for the victorious king, for the sake of obtaining the flow of water in the form of wealth. ||25|| The king under whose rule the subjects were suffering due to the burden of taxes, 
1 Destruction of chariots, complete destruction of the side. 2 Loss of energy. 3 Nearby. 4 Those whose influence and spread have been removed. On the side, those whose heat and spread have been removed. 5 Bharata. 6 Meaning, the state of a person who has reached the time of death. 7 Desires enmity. 8 Who is not in this etc. (Not a man etc. Commentary). 9 Desiring to extinguish. 10 Attracting. 11 Accepting. 12 There is no wealth for those, those are the enemies, their state is the truth, meaning, poverty. 13 The sound of being a great enemy. 14 By the army. 15 Fearless. 16 Those born in noble families. 17 He used to earn. In the acquisition of land, movement, and acquisition. 18 Rivers. 'Kulyā, Kulvadhu, Sarit'. Or artificial rivers. In that case, 'Kulyā, small, artificial river'. 19 Suffering, etc. 20 He established a man who was capable of giving appropriate punishment.

The thirty-first chapter describes how the king subdued the arrogant kings and bestowed favors upon those who were righteous and performed good deeds. This is indeed the righteous duty of a Kshatriya, for it is their desire to benefit the people. ||27||
The king Bharat did not only concern himself with the welfare (yoga and kshema) of the people for the sake of the world's stability, but also for the welfare of those kings who protected the people. He always considered their yoga and kshema. ||28||
The people of a single kingdom are classified into four varnas: Brahmanas, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas, and Shudras. However, the people of a Chakravarti are the kings who have been subdued. Therefore, it is appropriate for the Chakravarti to be concerned with the welfare of the kings as well as the people. ||29||
The main instrument for achieving all of Bharat's goals was punya (merit), and the Chakra Ratna was the means of strengthening that punya. Both punya and the Chakra Ratna were the limbs of his accomplishment (victory), while the other limbs of the army, such as elephants, horses, etc., were only for splendor. ||30||
Thus, by forcibly making the Mandala kings bow down, the Chakravarti only humbled them, he did not destroy their love for his service. ||31||
Like protecting their own lives, many kings would come to him at every stop and bow down, carrying his command on their heads. ||32||
The king Bharat bestowed great rewards upon the kings who bowed down to him. This is appropriate, for what service is ever rendered to a Kalpavriksha without fruit, or with only a little fruit? ||33||
The emperor Bharat delighted many kings by looking at them, smiling at them, laughing at them, conversing with them with confidence, and honoring them. ||34||
He expressed his happiness by smiling at many kings, his trust by conversing with them, his joy by laughing at them, and his affection by looking at them. ||35||

Adipurana "He pleased the submissive ones and greatly angered the opponents. Peace and prowess are the two qualities fit for a king who wants to conquer the earth. ||36||  Bharata, with a pleased gaze, showed his pleasure to the submissive ones and with a furrowed brow, showed his anger to the enemy. Thus, it is true that kings are like actors. ||37||  He was very pleased with the kings of Anga, who offered him precious gems, the kings of Vanga, who offered him tall elephants, and the kings of Kalinga, who offered him both gems and elephants. ||38||  The kings of Magadha, desiring his favor, praised his excellent qualities, so they seemed like prisoners. ||39||  The commander of Bharata's army, without any effort, brought under his control the kings of Kuru, Avanti, Panchala, Kashi, Kosala, and Vidarbha. ||40||  Going from country to country, the commander proclaimed Bharata's orders in Madra, Kachchha, Chedi, Vatsa, Suhma, Pund, Aud, and Gauda. ||41||  He quickly brought under his control the kings of Dasharna, Kamarupa, Kashmir, Ushinar, and the entire middle country. ||42||  The kings of the eastern countries, Kalinga, and Anga, offered Bharata elephants as gifts, elephants as tall as mountains, with streams of mad flowing from their trunks. ||43||  The lords of the forests, where elephants are born, offered him elephants born in the Dasharna forest, and elephants born in Chedi and Kakusha, who could compete with the celestial elephants. ||44||  At that time, Bharata was receiving countless gems as gifts from all over the earth. It seemed as if the earth, like a pregnant woman, could not bear the unbearable burden of the chakravarti's army and had given birth to countless gems. ||45||

Having surrounded the forest on the banks of the Malyaavati river, which was full of wild elephants, and having drunk the water of the Yamuna, the elephants of Bharata conquered all the directions in that region. ||19|| Having gone along the banks of the Veṇumatī river, they achieved victory. Having invaded the land of the Vatsas, they crossed the Daśārnā river as well. ||60|| They crossed the wide rivers Viśālā, Nālikā, Sindhu, Pārā, Niḥkuṇḍarī, Bahuvajrā, Ramyā, Sikatinī, Kuhā, Samatoyā, Kañjā, Kapīvatī, Nirvindhyā, the best of rivers, Jambūmatī, Vasumatī, Śarkarāvatī, which flows to the ocean, Siprā, Kṛtamālā, Parijā, Panasā, Avantikāmā, Hastipānī, Kāgandhumā, Vyāghrī, Carmaṇvatī, Śatabhōgā, Nandā, Karabhavegīnī, Cullitāpī, Revā, Saptapārā, and Kauśikī. ||61-66|| Having crossed the mountain called Tairascik, they surrounded the mountain called Vaiḍūrya, and then, crossing the mountain called Kūṭācala, they reached the mountain called Pāriyātra. ||67|| Having gone to the peak of the mountain called Puṣpagiri, they climbed the peak of the mountain called Sitagiri, and then, having gone from there, they rested in the groves of the mountain called Gadāgiri. ||68|| The soldiers of Bharata took shelter in the caves of the mountain called Ṛkṣavān, along with the caves of the mountain called Vātaprṣṭha, and then, having gone from there, they took shelter on the banks of the mountain called Kambala. ||69|| Having crossed the great mountain called Vāsavanta, they stayed on the mountain called Asuradhūpana, and then, having gone from there, they reached the mountains called Madebha, Ānanga, and Reyika. ||70|| Thinking that those countries were without enemies, the soldiers were roaming about in the forest regions, capturing elephants with their own elephants. ||71|| The rivers that were difficult to cross, became easy to cross, having been enjoyed by the soldiers.

The nations and their kings, the lords of the earth, were born for the benefit of the lord, and were connected by him with these benefits. ||73||
The kings who lived beyond the sea, and also those who lived on the islands in the sea, were subdued by the mighty Bharata with his army, and he captured the elephants born in the forests and nourished them. ||74||
Having obtained from them various jewels as he desired, he was pleased and placed them back in their places according to his command. ||75||
The great mountain fortresses and the fortresses in the lowlands were all subdued by the army of the lord. What is impossible for the great? ||76||
Thus, having conquered all the kings of the east, he set out from the middle of the earth towards the south, desiring to conquer the kings of the south. ||77||
Wherever the victorious Bharata's army, led by the excellent commander, went, there the kings, along with their vassals, bowed their heads in reverence. ||78||
In the south, he conquered the kings of Trikalinga, Odra, Kachchha, Prātar, Kerala, Cola, and Punnaga. ||79||
And he subdued the kings of Kuḍumba, Olika, Mahiṣa, Kamekura, Pāṇḍya, and Antarapāṇḍya by means of his royal power. ||80||
Having quickly conquered these kings and made them bow down at his feet, the lord obtained supreme joy by taking their essential jewels. ||81||
The commander, carrying out the lord's command, also wandered through the many mountains, rivers, and countries near the Kālinga forest. ||82||
He, along with his forces, reached the great rivers Taila, Ikshumati, Nakarava, Vanga, and Śvasana. ||83||

(17) "Just as a man, by taking the hand of a woman, brings her under his control, so the Chakravarti Bharat, by taking taxes, brought the southern region under his control, and then forcibly took its essence and proceeded towards the southern sea." (18) "Seeing the forest near the shore, which was full of clove and jasmine vines, and small cardamom plants, he was filled with great joy." (19) "The air of the forest, which was fragrant with cardamom, and which was gentle, was moving the lotus flowers in the ponds." (100) "The forest, with its branches swaying in the wind, and its flowers scattered like offerings, seemed to be welcoming the Chakravarti." (101) "The trees, with their branches swaying in the wind, and the buzzing of the bees, seemed to be calling out to Bharat's soldiers to rest." (102) "Then, the Chakravarti stationed his army in the forest, near the sea, by the great gate called Vijayanta." (103) "The forest and Bharat's army were alike, for just as the forest was full of sandalwood trees, so was the army full of elephants; just as the forest was full of Nagakesar trees, so was the army full of noble men; just as the forest was full of flowers, so was the army full of gods and good-hearted men; and just as the forest was full of birds, so was the army full of chariots."

The trees of that forest were like the kings, for just as kings are endowed with good radiance, so too were the trees of that forest endowed with good shade. Just as kings are endowed with wealth, so too were the trees of that forest endowed with fruits. Just as kings are noble and tall, so too were the trees of that forest tall. Just as kings are adorned with many chariots and other paraphernalia, so too were the trees of that forest adorned with many leaves. And just as kings are those who remove the suffering of poverty, so too were the trees of that forest those who removed the heat of the sun. Thus, the soldiers of Bharata were taking shelter under the trees, which were like kings, with great love. || 105 ||

Many of the soldiers were leaving behind the large trees that had good shade but no fruit, and were taking shelter under the smaller trees that had little shade but bore fruit. Meaning - Just as servants leave behind a miserly master who is wealthy but does not give proper wages, and take shelter under a generous master who is poor but gives proper wages, so too were the soldiers leaving behind the large fruitless trees and taking shelter under the smaller fruitful trees. || 106 ||

The soldiers were leaving behind the temporary shade outside and sitting under the shade of the trees that would come later. || 107 ||

Many soldiers, along with their wives, were sitting on the banks of the ponds, the sun's rays blocked by the shade of the trees of the forest. || 108 ||

The trees of the forest, under which the kings were sitting with their wives, bound by mutual love, were clearly displaying the beauty born of the Kalpa trees. Meaning - Those trees of the forest seemed like Kalpa trees, and the men and women sitting under them seemed like the Aryas and Aryas of the land of enjoyment. || 109 ||

The monkeys, shaking the buds of the Kadamba trees, were disturbing the soldiers sitting under the creepers, because the hairs of the Kadamba buds cause itching when they touch the body. || 110 ||

Near the ponds were soft grasses that could be grazed at will and that could be broken by the mere breath.
-
1 Radiant and bright. 2 With many chariots and many vehicles. 3 Trees and kings. 4 Unstable. 5 - The people were taking shelter under the trees. 6 Along with their wives. 7 Of the monkeys.

The horses were slowly shaking their bodies, wanting to get rid of the dust. ||113|| The pollen of lotuses, carried by the wind, was floating in the air, creating a beautiful canopy, as if it were a specially made tent for the horses. ||114|| The horses, seeing the earth covered in dust, were disgusted and quickly entered the lakes. ||115|| The horses, having entered the water filled with lotus pollen, had their body paint washed away, but they regained their color from the pollen of the lotuses. ||116|| The horses, having bathed in the lakes and quenched their thirst, were standing in the large tents, their eyes half-closed. ||117|| The elephants of King Bharat, with their tall bodies, were housed in the groves of coconut and palm trees, which were very suitable for them. ||118|| The forest floor, uneven due to the fallen coconuts, was made suitable for the elephants by removing the coconuts from one side. ||119|| The elephants, who were very thirsty and were showing their fatigue by spraying water from their trunks, were taken to the lakes by their mahouts to drink water. ||120|| The mahouts took the elephants, who were showing fatigue from their slow walk, to the lakes to bathe. ||121||

**Verse 122:**  The newly captured elephant, though repeatedly urged, did not want to enter the water covered with lotus leaves, fearing the ocean.

**Verse 123:**  The elephant, captured for a long time, was curiously looking at the forest with its fresh, edible leaves.

**Verse 124:**  Many elephants did not drink water or eat grass at will, they were only remembering the pleasures arising from the enjoyment of the forest.

**Verse 125:**  The elephant keepers were taking the elephants, whose trunks were raised high and whose sides were adorned with shining golden garlands, to the lakes. At that time, the elephants appeared like blue mountains with serpents or clouds with lightning.

**Verse 126:**  The elephant keeper, with great difficulty, brought the elephant, who was enraged by the wind carrying the scent of the wild elephant's rut, near the water.

**Verse 127:**  Suddenly, an enraged elephant shook its head sideways, not under the control of the goad, and was causing distress to the elephant keeper.

**Verse 128:**  Just as a rutting elephant does not desire a female elephant whose body is filled with the scent of the wild elephant's rut, so too, a rutting elephant did not want to enter a lake whose water was filled with the scent of the wild elephant's play.

**Verse 129:**  The war elephants did not drink the water that the forest elephants had drunk before, and which was therefore filled with the scent of rut. They only sniffed it with their trunks and threw it away.

**Verse 130:**  The elephants who drank the lake water increased the volume of the lake water by shedding their rut. This is appropriate, because the noble ones do not desire to take anything from anyone for no reason.

**Verse 131:**  Even though a rutting elephant was submerged in the middle of the lake with its trunk raised, it was clearly understood that he was there, as the bees were flying in the sky and making a buzzing sound.

**Verse 132:**  A rutting elephant, whose roar competed with the clouds, was scratching the itch on his cheeks with the strong spray of water from his trunk.

The Thirty-First Chapter

With their trunks raised high, the elephants trumpeted, spraying water into the sky, which, as it fell, resembled a crystal rod.  (133)  Some of the elephants, their fatigue washed away by their immersion in the water, were happily munching on lotus stalks. (134)  Others, adorned with lotus stalks placed on their tusks, seemed to have sprouted new shoots from their tusks, as if they were constantly being watered. (135)  One elephant, intoxicated with madness, mistook a lotus stalk he had raised with his trunk for a rope and doubled it, offering it to his handler. (136)  A timid elephant, pulling at a lotus stalk stuck to his foot, mistook it for a chain and remained on the bank of the lake, fearing it. (137)  Standing with lotuses raised in their trunks, the elephants seemed to be offering them as an oblation, remembering the gods. (138)  Their bodies washed by the waves of the lake, the tall elephants were adorned with the pollen of the dense lotuses, as if they had been bathed and decorated. (139)  It is fitting that the birds, having abandoned the lake water surrounded by elephants, have gone to the shore, for the weak must do what is right. (140)  Even though their bodies were cleansed by their immersion in the lakes, some elephants, throwing up dust, were again making themselves dirty. (141)  "We are Chandals by birth, and we are further excited by our madness (the liquid flowing from our temples).  Where can we find purity?"  It was as if the elephants had thrown dust on themselves, thinking this. (142)

**Vasantatilaka Vritta**

Thus, the elephants, having sported in the lakes for a long time, and having calmed their inner heat with the water, went to the trees on the shore.  They did not, however, give up their constant attachment to the water. (143)

Having drunk the water of the lakes, the elephants increased their own water of pride, as if in exchange for it. The wise ones, fearing the obstruction caused by the waves of their hands, quickly left the lakes. || 144 ||
The elephant keepers, wanting to cleanse the elephants, who were stained with the ink of pride, entered the water of the lakes. They could not make them enter the water, so they only tried to give them water to drink. Even after much persuasion, they were unable to give even water to drink to those elephants who were standing on the shore. Meaning - The intoxicated elephants neither entered the water nor drank it. || 145 ||
The intoxicated elephants neither drank the water that they had obtained without effort, nor did they pluck anything from the trees on the shore, nor did they find any comfort in the shade of the trees. Alas, this pride is never beneficial to the soul. || 146 ||
It is not that these elephants, being heavy-bodied, did not travel quickly. That is, they traveled quickly even though they were heavy. They never committed any offense in battle, and they are the most capable of carrying burdens. Yet, they had to be bound only because of their fickleness. Therefore, let this fickleness be cursed. || 147 ||
Why are you binding us in this way without any offense? You should know that this act of yours will soon bring you retribution. Thus, the elephants, shaking their heads, clearly showed their anger towards the elephant keepers by raising their ankushas above their heads. || 148 ||
The elephants, who were destroyers of creatures, were especially bound in their limbs, yet they were not restrained, which shows their fickleness. || 147 ||
"Why are you binding us?" said the elephants, "Know this, O elephant keepers, that this will soon bring you retribution." Thus, shaking their heads, the elephants clearly showed their anger towards the elephant keepers by raising their ankushas above their heads. || 148 ||

The elephants of the army were tied to the tall trees in the forest, which is appropriate because a very large support is needed to hold great men whose strength has not been destroyed. ||150||

Thus, the group of elephants, tied to the trees by the mahouts, stood with their eyes half-closed, their bodies swaying, taking bites playfully, and their ears flapping. ||151||

The female elephants, having shed all their burdens and showing their swiftness, rushed to drink the water of the ponds, followed by their playful calves. ||152||

The young elephant did not want to drink the water of the ponds that had been drunk by the group of camels, which was contaminated by their belches and had the smell of their bodies, even though he was very thirsty. This is appropriate because everyone desires what is pleasing to their mind. ||153||

The female elephants and their calves drank the water of the ponds that had been drunk by the group of elephants and had the smell of their intoxicating water, with great joy. This is appropriate because similarity is the cause of enjoyment in eating, drinking, and other pleasures. ||154||

Having quenched their inner thirst by drinking water and extinguished their outer heat by entering the ponds, the female elephants, along with their calves, went to enjoy the forest. ||155||

The herd of elephants was devouring the buds of the creepers with their flowers, the small plants, the succulent **kadangara** trees, and the sweet and tender branches of the forest trees. (156)

They were digging up the tender shoots of grass in the groves, breaking the ridges of the fields with their teeth, and playfully indulging in eating the tips of the creepers and plucking the fruits. (157)

"Go to the dense forest with its tall branches, where the young creepers with leaves are growing. Sit in the grove and go near the **sallaki** forests, which are fit for eating." Thus, commanded by the mahouts, the herd of elephants was roaming in the forest. (158)

The herd of elephants, which was enjoying the forest in various ways, was free to move about, but the mahouts were restraining them and they were fit to be tied. Thus, the herd of elephants, along with their young ones, reached their suitable dwelling place. (159)

The horses, frightened by the elephants, have overturned this chariot on the wrong path, its axle and wheel have broken, and these she-mules, eager to carry the courtesans, are fleeing very quickly, leaving their path. (160)

This elephant, frightened by the sight of the camel, is running away, revealing its fear. And this woman, whose garment has slipped from her breasts and thighs, is falling from the frightened mule. (161)

Thus, the words of ordinary men speaking loudly, the sounds of donkeys, camels, and bulls, agitated by the commotion, and the harsh words of the soldiers calling to each other, caused a moment of confusion among the kings' armies. (162)

The emperor, with his vast wealth, quickly conquered the Lokapālas, followed by a multitude of kings on horseback. He entered his grand encampment, surrounded by the auspicious chants of the vanquished. || 163 ||

The wind, carrying the fragrance of lotuses, gently blew through the rows of trees on the shore, calming the emperor's weariness. It was as if the ocean, a close relative, had sent a fragrant messenger to comfort him. || 164 ||

The emperor's army encampment mirrored the ocean. Just as the ocean is filled with countless conch shells and jewels, so too was the encampment filled with treasures and gems. Just as the ocean is adorned with serpents, whose heads are adorned with shining jewels, so too was the encampment adorned with kings, whose crowns sparkled with precious stones. Just as the ocean constantly expands, so too did the emperor's army grow. And just as the ocean encompasses all directions, so too did the encampment spread in every direction. || 165 ||

The lord of treasures, who had stationed his army on the seashore and conquered the assembly of the Magadha king with his victorious weapons, rode his chariot into the ocean. He conquered the lord of the intermediate directions, the king of the Varatanu, who was like the Magadha king. With his glorious victory, he adorned the Varatanu island, which resided within the ocean, with eternal fame. || 166 ||

Bharata received from the Varatanu king an unbreakable armor, a shining necklace, a dazzling crown jewel, divine bracelets, and a sacred thread adorned with precious stones. Then, he entered the city through the gate of the glorious Vaijayanta ocean, which was worshipped with offerings of precious stones. || 167 ||

**Self-manifested, the ocean, like a minister, was devoid of deceit, serving Bharat. Just as a minister reveals his pure heart, so too did the ocean reveal its pure heart (innermost part) through the deceit of pearls. Just as a minister reveals his inner affection (love), so too did the ocean reveal its inner affection (red color) through the sprouting corals. Just as a minister surrenders all his possessions, so too did the ocean surrender all its possessions (water). Just as a minister keeps his secret wealth close, so too did the ocean keep its secret wealth (gems, etc.) close. Just as a minister is generous and straightforward, so too was the ocean located in the south (south-facing).**

**Or, just as Indra, being a servant, served the first Jina, Lord Rishabhadeva, the master of infinite wealth in the form of Lakshmi, so too did the ocean, being a servant, serve Bharat Chakravarti, the master of the wealth of the kingdom. Just as Indra, going to the assembly hall (Samavasarana), played the victory drum, so too did the ocean, near Bharat's assembly hall (Sabhamandapa), play the victory drum with its roar. Just as Indra, in the morning, uttered the words "Victory, Victory" for the auspicious reading, so too did the ocean, in the morning, clearly utter the words "Victory, Victory" with its deep sound for the auspicious reading of Bharat. Just as Indra, being a reservoir (Jadashaya) and thus having limited knowledge, was still a wise man (Ajaldhi) or a non-material being (Ajada) who meditated on the non-material (Ajadam Dhyayatiti Ajaldhi), so too was the ocean, being a reservoir (Jalayu) and thus filled with water, still a wise man (Ajaldhi) who was not desirous of obtaining water (Nasti Jale Dhiryasya Sah). Thus, the ocean served Bharateshwara for a long time.**

The thirtieth chapter: The emperor Bharat, eager to conquer the western region, set out with his army, conquering the southern and western regions (the southwest). [1] His army was led by a group of horses, followed by chariots, with elephants in the middle and infantry spread throughout. [2] The army of Bharat, consisting of elephants, horses, chariots, and infantry, marched alongside the armies of the gods and the vidyadharas. Thus, his army expanded in all directions with its six limbs. [3] The movement of the army caused the ocean to churn and wave, as if it were telling the servants, "Everyone should follow the great men." [4] The kings, overwhelmed by the army's force, were humbled, the rivers were filled with mud, and the great mountains, like the earth, were leveled. [5] All the achievements of this emperor, which were delightful to enjoy, satisfying, and desirable to those who wished to enjoy them, bore fruit with his great efforts. [6] The strength and army of Bharat, impenetrable, firmly united, and the cause of the enemy's destruction, were influencing the enemy kings. [7] The warriors of Bharat were like his arrows, for just as warriors were equipped with fruit, i.e., desired benefits, so too were arrows equipped with fruit, i.e., iron tips. Just as warriors were sharp, i.e., brilliant, so too were arrows sharp, i.e.,

The enemies, abandoned by their armies and stripped of their possessions, were truly left without support. ||9||  The enemies, constantly enjoying the fruits of their wealth, were ironically reduced to a state of poverty, even in their anger. ||10||  Bharata's concern for *sandhi* (union) and *vigraha* (separation) was only in the realm of grammar, not in relation to his enemies. For, how could he engage in *sandhi* with those who had been vanquished, or in *vigraha* with those who had been destroyed? ||11||  Thus, although there was no enemy worthy of being conquered, Bharata, under the guise of conquering the directions, merely circled his own territory. ||12||  Bharata's army invaded the land on the other side of the ocean, where the land was shaded by betel nut trees and filled with coconut groves. ||13||  The juice of the young coconut trees flowed, providing refreshment for Bharata's soldiers resting in the shade of the trees on the banks of the lakes. ||14|| 

Page #101:
---------------------------
The thirty-first day, he stayed there, having drunk the water of the confluence of the three rivers. In the palm groves, he heard the rustling sound of dry leaves, caused by the wind.  He saw betel nut trees, intertwined with betel vines, as if they were one entity. The king was delighted to see the betel nut trees, which were supported by the betel vines, and which seemed to be entwined with them like a couple. He saw birds, making continuous sounds in the forests, as if they were sages engaged in their studies. The people ate the jackfruit, which were soft inside and had thorns on the outer skin, as if they were ambrosia. They drank coconut juice, ate jackfruit, and had pepper as a condiment. This was their daily routine in the forest. The king saw birds, making sounds as they ate the sweet pepper, and tears flowing from their eyes. He saw young monkeys, shaking their heads, after eating the sharp pepper pods, as if they were afraid. Seeing the trees, laden with fruits, and beneficial to people, the people were convinced of the existence of Kalpavriksha trees. The forest trees, entwined with creeper-like women, and bearing many fruits, seemed to be offering gifts to the people, as if they were their relatives. The Singhalese women, intoxicated with coconut juice, and with their eyes slightly rolling, praised his glory in a low voice.

The Adi Purana

On the Trikūṭa mountain, in the Malaya range, and at the Pandya gateway, the Kinnara women sang the praises of the emperor with deep voices. ||26|| In the forests at the foot of the Malaya mountains and in the Sahya range, the women of the forest sang the emperor's victory. ||27|| The wind blew softly, carrying the fragrance of sandalwood gardens, and it carried away the droplets of water from the waterfalls of the Malaya mountains. ||28|| Though the wind was free to roam in all directions, it still honored the emperor's hospitality, as if it were a dutiful servant, and it relieved his fatigue. ||29|| The Kerala women, young and beautiful, wandered through the groves of tamala trees, their breath fragrant with the scent of cardamom and cloves, their breasts adorned with thick sandalwood paste, their hips swaying gracefully, their smiles like blooming flowers of love, their voices sweet as the cuckoo's song, their movements graceful as the swaying of vines, their feet dancing lightly, their bodies adorned with pearls, their voices singing intoxicating songs that charmed the bees. ||30-34|| Thus, the emperor Bharata, having conquered the south with his victorious army, bowed to the rulers of the Chola, Kerala, and Pandya kingdoms. ||35||

The thirtieth festival of the Kalinga king, the Malayopapantbhudharas, were invaded by the elephants of Kalinga, who were as tall as the Malaya mountain. [36] The elephants of Bharata, who had rested at the ends of the directions during the Digvijaya, had become Diggajas themselves, so the story of the other eight Diggajas was only for show. [37] Then, ascending to the western part, Bharata, approaching the shore of the Sahya mountain, conquered the kings who protected the end of the western sea's altar. [38] Bharata's victorious army spread out everywhere along the shore of the sea, and it was so large that it covered the other shore of the sea. [39] At that time, the Upsamudra, swaying in the wind, seemed as if it were extremely agitated with fear, seeing Bharata's army on both shores. [40] The Upsamudra of that shore, due to the agitation of the army, came towards this shore, and the Upsamudra of this shore, due to the agitation of the army, went towards that shore. [41] The water of that sea, covered with the brilliance of green gems, was so beautiful as if the bottom of the sea, along with its seaweed, had turned upside down after a long time. [42] In some places, the water of the sea, covered with the rays of Padmaraga gems, seemed as if the heart of the sea had burst due to the agitation of the army, and blood was coming out of it. [43] The sea, rolling in the lap of the Sahya mountain, seemed as if it were telling its sorrow, and the Sahya mountain, holding it, seemed as if it were increasing its brotherhood with it. [44] The Sahya mountain, greatly afflicted by the unbearable gatherings of the army, seemed as if it were placing a bundle of wood on its head, like a sick tree trying to raise its branches. [45]

The thirty-first river, the Nira, whose water is covered by the branches of trees on its banks, and whose roots have been uprooted by the force of its current, which has torn away the banks. The Bana river, whose sound is incessant, the Ketva river, filled with water, the Kariri river, whose banks have been broken by elephants, or whose banks are covered with Kariri trees, the best of rivers. The Prahara river, polluted by the wicked, like a woman who is unfaithful, or polluted by large crocodiles, the Murra river, free from mud, like a virtuous woman, and served by Kurer birds. The Para river, whose banks are filled with the sound of cranes, geese, and sarasa birds. The Madana river, whose water is equal and flows on low ground, and whose flow is never interrupted. The Godavari river, which flows like the flowing milk of a Sahya mountain-like elephant, with many branches, whose flow is uninterrupted, and which is very wide. The Tapi river, whose banks are covered with Kariri forests, and whose water is slightly warm from the heat of the sun. The beautiful Langal-Khatika river, whose banks are shaded by trees, where the young of deer sleep, and which resembles a ditch in the west. The commander crossed all these rivers with his army. At that time, he also captured wild elephants that were intoxicated with madness. The army of Bharata, which was eager to drink the ocean with its rivers-like tongues, crossed the Sahya mountain and reached the Vindhya mountain. The emperor Bharata saw the Vindhya mountain as his equal, because just as he was the lord of the kings, so was the Vindhya mountain the lord of the mountains. Just as he was noble, so was the Vindhya mountain high.

The mountain was adorned with lofty peaks, stretching far and wide, with numerous flying vehicles bearing flags, as if they had come to rest there.  It extended its reach into the ocean from both its eastern and western extremities, as if seeking friendship with the sea out of fear of the forest fire.  The waterfalls on this mountain, forever nourishing the trees on its banks, seemed to proclaim, "The lord should surely protect those who seek refuge at his feet."  The mountain, with its roaring waterfalls, seemed to be laughing, as if the water, cascading down from the high and low rocks on its banks, were the laughter of river-goddesses.  The forest fire, unable to consume the entire forest, seemed to be climbing the peaks, as if seeking to commit suicide by falling from above.  The peaks of this mountain, surrounded by the blazing forest fire near the month of Ashadha, appeared to the Bhils like they were made of gold.  The forest on this mountain was sometimes filled with elephants, or with Chandals, with snakes, or with wicked people, and with thorns, or with troublesome people, making it a very sorrowful or deplorable sight.  The forest on this mountain, though filled with intoxicated elephants, was also devoid of intoxicated elephants, and though devoid of leaves, it was also full of leaves and buds.

**7.** With split bamboo stalks, scattered pearl-like fruits, and the forest goddess, as if laughing, with her teeth flashing, in the forest.

**75.** With the sound of deep waterfalls bursting forth from the mouths of caves, it roars, as if competing in glory with the Kulachala mountains.

**76.** With its uneven, high and low terrain, and its diverse colors of metals, it bears a picturesque form, with deer-like shapes and unimaginable colors.

**77.** In the depths of its forests, at the onset of night, its glowing herbs appear as if deities have hung lamps to dispel the darkness.

**78.** In some places, the area near the mountain is adorned with scattered flowers, as if it were adorned with the beauty of scattered pearls, flung from the heads of elephants, torn apart by lion kings.

**79.** Seeing that great mountain from afar, which seemed to call out with its trees swaying in the wind, the Chakravarti Bharat approached it.

**80.** From afar, he saw dense, dark-colored tribesmen and elephants in the forest. The tribesmen, like dark clouds, held their bamboo bows high on their shoulders, and the elephants, like dark clouds, bore their high, bow-shaped backbones.

**81.** He saw the river-brides, with their eyes wide open, like the beloved wives of the Vindhyachal, their voices like the sounds of birds, eagerly awaiting their beloved.

**73.** This was the way the forest, though seemingly contradictory, was still beautiful. The meaning is that this verse uses the figure of speech called **virodhabhasa**. The contradiction has been shown above, now see its resolution. The forest there, though filled with **kshibakunjara** (mad elephants), was also a giver of **akshibakunjara** (sea salt and ivory), or a provider of arbors of creepers for the **sahajanas**. And though it was filled with **vipatra** (birds with wings), it was also full of excellent leaves and new shoots. (**akshiba** and **kunja** together make **akshibakunja**, which means a giver of **akshiba** (sea salt) and **kunja** (ivory), or **akshiba** (creepers) and **kunja** (arbor) which gives **akshiba** (creepers) and **kunja** (arbor). **akshiba** also means **shobhajanas** (beautiful things), and **kunja** means **lata griha** (arbor of creepers). **akshiba** also means **samudra** (sea), **lavaṇa** (salt), **vashira** (ivory), and **kunja** means **danta** (tooth), but not **striya** (woman). **shobhajanas** (beautiful things) are **shigru** (creepers), **tikshna gandha** (strong fragrance), and **akshiba** (creepers), which are **mochana** (liberators) of all. This is the meaning of **amaras** (immortals) everywhere.)

They saw the excellent river Narmada in the middle of the Vindhyachal, spreading like the ocean, its fame reaching far and wide.  Its flow was full of waves, like the long braid of the earth, or like the banner of victory of the Vindhyachal, proclaiming its conquest over all other mountains.  The birds were flying above it, disturbed by the commotion of the army, and for a moment, it seemed as if the river had erected a welcoming archway for the emperor's arrival.  

The Narmada truly became a source of joy for the queens, as she pushed them with fish near their thighs while they crossed the river.  Crossing the Narmada, whose birds were flying up due to the commotion of the people, the army marched towards the north of the Vindhyachal, considering it their destination.  

Bharata saw the Vindhyachal on both the south and north sides.  The mountain, appearing on both sides, seemed to have divided itself and offered itself to both directions.  The camp of Bharata's army was situated on both banks of the Narmada, and it was so magnificent that it seemed to be another Vindhyachal, encompassing the original one with its vastness.  

The camp and the Vindhyachal were indistinguishable, for just as there were elephants in the camp, so too were there large black rocks, like elephants, in the Vindhyachal.  And just as there were many horses roaming in the camp, so too were there many Kinnaras with horse-like faces roaming in the Vindhyachal.  (In the tradition of poets, the faces of Kinnaras are described as being like those of horses.)  

The army had consumed all the fruits, leaves, and trees of the Vindhyachal, and had stripped the vines and small plants of their flowers.  Therefore, the Vindhyachal became barren at that time, devoid of fruits, flowers, and other such things.  

The soldiers, worshipping the Jina with rice mixed with pearls, enjoyed themselves freely in the pleasant Vindhyachal.

The thirty-first festival was celebrated, and the forest kings saw him there. They presented him with forest-born, disease-curing, and praiseworthy great medicines. ||12|| The kings of the Kiratas, who were worthy and excellent, presented him with the teeth of elephants, along with pearls, as a fitting gift. ||53|| The army of the Chakravarti, having crossed the Vindhyas from the western end and crossed the Narmada, set out to conquer the west. ||1|| Having gone a little to the north, the army spread out in the western direction. The invincible prowess of the Chakravarti was at the forefront, and behind him was the army with its chariots. ||15|| At that time, the dust raised by the hooves of the galloping horses did not only obstruct the brilliance of the enemies, but also the brilliance of the sun. ||16|| The kings of the Lata country, who had worn down the earth with their foreheads and who spoke sweetly, were subdued by the command of the Chakravarti and attained his Lalatik Pada. (Lalatik: One who always looks at the face of the master to know what he commands.) ||97|| Some forest kings, born in Saurashtra, and some born in the Panchanada, presented elephants to the Chakravarti. ||98|| Seeing the Chakra, many kings, like the planets, became subdued by the Chakravarti. ||19|| The Chakravarti, like a lion, subdued the kings of the earth, who were born in noble lineages and were proud, by force. ||10|| The Chakravarti, having pleased the kings of Saurashtra, who had presented him with hundreds of camels and horses, enjoyed the beautiful land of Raivataka. ||101|| It was right for him to stay there, because living on the Vindhyas is very pleasant. ||91|| The kings of the Vindhya forests, having presented him with forest-born, disease-curing, and praiseworthy great medicines, saw King Bharat, who was staying there. ||92|| The kings of the Bhils, having presented King Bharat with the teeth of large elephants and pearls, did well, because one should honor one's master according to one's ability. ||93|| The army of the Chakravarti, having crossed the Vindhyas from the western end and crossed the Narmada, set out to conquer the west. ||94||

The Adi Purana states that Emperor Bharata, while serving or meeting with great affection, reached the beautiful regions of Mount Girnar. [101] Remembering the future pilgrimage of Nemnath, he circumambulated Mount Girnar, which was as high as Mount Sumeru, in the Sorat country, and proceeded further. [102] The kings of those countries, having presented the best silk garments, China silk, and many other fine garments, had the darshan of Emperor Bharata. [103] Bharata had endeared himself to many kings by honor and gifts, to many by trust and affectionate conversation, and to many by a pleasing gaze. [104] Many kings, pleased, had worshipped Emperor Bharata, who had come to their country, with excellent elephants, noble horses, and various kinds of jewels. [105] Many other kings served Bharata with horses born in the Turushka country, which were swift and possessed of qualities of body, intellect, age, and strength. [106] Many kings presented horses born in the same country, as well as those born from horses of one country and mares of another, those who traveled in various directions and countries, those who were noble and possessed of perfect limbs, those born in the Kambhoja, Valhika, Taitil, Aratta, Saindhava, Vanayuj, Gandhara, and Vapi countries, and had the darshan of the Emperor. [107-108] Thus, Bharata did not only obtain jewels at every stop, but also gained fame by conquering great kings who were difficult to conquer by his prowess. [109] Bharata's commander, by his victorious armies, blocked the paths of water and land on all sides and conquered the mountain kings. [110] The commander, crossing over many kinds of countries, large forests, rivers, and mountains, quickly established the command of Emperor Bharata everywhere. [111] Thus, the Emperor, conquering the kings of the western direction in the same way as the kings of the eastern direction, and taking away their pride and wealth, proceeded towards the western ocean.

## The Thirtieth Chapter

The ocean, as if extending its river-like arms far and wide, seemed to be welcoming the great king Bharat, bearing offerings of various jewels.  ||113|| Those who say the ocean's jewels can be measured with a ladle, do not truly praise it, for its treasures are so vast that even large ships cannot measure them. ||114|| The ocean is called "Lavana Samudra" (Salt Sea), a name that belittles it. It is truly a "Ratnakar" (Ocean of Jewels), as the kings of that time recognized. ||115|| Even the sun, in its journey, dims its brilliance in the direction where the victorious king Bharat's radiance shines brightly, conquering the western kings. ||116|| Holding the Chakra Ratna (Wheel Jewel), crossing the ocean of battle, and causing fear in his enemies, Bharat shone like the sun. ||117|| Reaching the shore of the ocean, the prosperous Bharat established his invincible camp at the mouth of the Sindhu river, as if it were his own home. ||118|| Bharat's army resided in the beautiful forest on the banks of the Sindhu river, where the trees, due to the enjoyment of the elephants, had become like arbors. ||119|| The Purohita (priest), well-versed in the rituals of the city, worshipped the Lord of the Dharma Chakra (Wheel of Righteousness), the Jina, with proper rites. He then showered the victorious king Bharat with blessings, offering him auspicious Siddha Shesh Akshatas (rice grains) mixed with fragrant water. ||120-121|| Then, mounting his chariot, adorned with divine weapons, the king, with his usual disregard for the ocean's waves, set out on his journey. ||122||

## Adipurana, Chapter 123-127:

**Verse 123:**  Bharata, surpassing in brilliance, conquered Prabhasa, the lord of the Vyantaras, whose radiance rivaled the sun's.

**Verse 124:**  From Prabhasa, the Chakravarti received a net of pearls, a garland of Kalpavriksha flowers, and a golden chain, all gifts of Jayashri, the fish of victory.

**Verse 125:**  Thus, the victorious Bharata, through the rise of his virtuous deeds, conquered even the best of the gods. Therefore, O wise ones, always strive to acquire the wealth of virtue, which yields excellent results.

**Verse 126:**  Bharata, the possessor of unparalleled Lakshmi, reached the Sindhudwara, his chariot wheels churning the earth, raising dust that polluted the ocean. There, he conquered Prabhasa, the god, and obtained from him the essence of wealth.

**Verse 127:**  His chest adorned with a garland of Kalpavriksha flowers, like a creeper on Lakshmi's swing, his tall form adorned with two nets of pearls and gold, fearless and the lord of Lakshmi, Bharata emerged from the ocean, like Lakshmi's wedding house, radiating the brilliance of a newlywed groom.

## The Thirtieth Chapter

**The king, Jayanta, who conquered the eastern lands, the southern kings, and the western regions up to the Sindhu river, made all directions free from enemies. Like the guardians of the directions, he received salutations from all kings and made the gods tremble. Thus, the king, the lord of the earth, conquered the entire circle of directions.** (128)

**By virtue, one obtains the fortune of a Chakravarti, the divine fortune of Indra, the fortune of a Tirthankara, and the supreme fortune of liberation. Thus, by virtue, one becomes worthy of all four types of fortune. Therefore, O wise ones, acquire virtue according to the sacred teachings of the Jina.** (129)

**Thus ends the thirtieth chapter of the *Trishatilakṣaṇamahāpurāṇa*, a collection of the great Puranas composed by the venerable Jinaseṇa, known as the *Ārsha*, which describes the conquest of the western sea gate.** (30)

Thirty-first Chapter

The glorious one, eager to conquer the Kuberimath, set out with an army of many horses, halting the directions. ||1|| Those who knew the nature of horses recognized their gait as Dhourit, their strength as Utsah, their training as Laghav, and their breed from their bodily features. ||2|| Dhourit is the skill of movement, Utsah is the prowess, training is the humility, and the radiance of the hair is the quality of the body. ||3|| The horses, eager to reach the front, were moving very fast, as if they wanted to overtake their hindquarters with their forequarters. ||4|| Many great horses, displaying their prowess, were moving on the path, as if fearing that the dust raised by their hooves might touch their own bodies. ||5|| Some horses could not bear to have their shadow move with them, so they were breaking it with their hooves, but the shadow, being subtle, was not hindered in any way. ||6|| Some horses seemed to be dancing on the earth, as if they were performing a dance with the sound of drums and other instruments at the beginning of their movement. ||7|| The horses, whose nature and prowess were steady, were restless only in their movement, as they were digging the earth with their moving hooves. ||8|| The number of horses belonging to the Chakravarti, who were swift as the wind, of the best breed, and fit for the task, was eighteen crore. ||9|| The river, which has stopped the forests on its banks, which has filled the earth on its banks with its currents, is flowing towards the opposite direction of the Sindhu river. ||10|| 

Page #115:
---------------------------
The thirty-first chapter:

The Sindhu River, as if pleased by the arrival of the Lord, served the army commanders with its gentle waves and winds, bringing them comfort.

Seeing the Sindhu River, adorned with the descriptions of the Ganga and filled with foam, approaching, the Lord of wealth (Bharata) considered the northern direction as conquered.

Following the banks of the Sindhu River, with his armies, the king subdued the rulers of the north, and slowly reached the peak of the Vijayardha mountain.

From afar, the Lord saw the Vijayardha mountain, adorned with nine peaks made of gems, as if it were offering an arghya (offering) with its peaks.

The mountain, with its branches swaying in the wind, seemed to be calling out to the victorious Lord, who had arrived from afar.

The mountain, with its waterfalls cascading from its peaks, seemed to be offering water for the Lord's feet, as if welcoming him.

The mountain, adorned with trees like Punnaga, Nagakesara, and Areca nut, and with beautiful forests on its banks, seemed to be inviting the Lord to rest.

The mountain, with its forest spreading a canopy of pollen carried by the wind, and with cuckoos singing like drums, seemed to be standing in respect of the Lord.

What more need be said? The mountain, with its abundant expressions of welcome, seemed to be honoring the Lord, who was ready to conquer the directions.

Passing through the high toranas (gateways) and crossing the elevated platform of the forest, the army, controlled by the army commanders, entered the forest.

The forest, surrounded by armies spreading in all directions, was filled with the cries of birds and the sighs of the wind. 

Page #116:
---------------------------
The earth was filled with the weight of the armies, their life-giving breath had flown, and they seemed to have become devoid of breath, as if they had died under the burden of the armies. ||21|| Hearing the unprecedented, wondrous, and powerful roar of the army, the animals dwelling in the forest were greatly terrified and distressed. ||22|| A white elephant, whose body was like that of an Airavata elephant, whose limbs were perfectly proportioned, and who roared sweetly, emerged from the forest, adorned with great splendor, due to the commotion of the army. ||23|| As if a lion, awakening, yawned and opened its mouth, showing its teeth, saying, "I fear nothing, see whatever you wish." ||24|| The Amapad, with great speed, leaped upwards, facing the sky, and fell down, but the Creator (Name-Karma), with cleverness, had made it stand firmly on its feet, with its back straight, so that it was unharmed. ||25|| The soldiers saw a fearless buffalo, whose shoulders were rubbed with stones, whose eyes were slightly reddened with anger, and who was digging the earth with its hooves. ||26|| Small animals, whose fear was aroused by the sound of the army, were taking refuge in the caves of the Vijayardha mountain, like in the time of the apocalypse. ||27|| The frightened deer, with their young following them, were running in all directions, their bodies trembling, as if they were drenched in the juice of fear. ||28|| The pigs, whose herds had scattered due to the commotion of the army, had abandoned their favorite food and were running around, having left their water-filled ponds. ||29|| Many other elephants, fleeing in fear, had hidden themselves in places covered with trees, and the deer were entering the caves of the lions. ||30|| 

Page #117:
---------------------------
## Chapter Thirty-One

Thus, the army, like the creatures of the forest, became extremely restless. After the turmoil subsided, they returned to their respective places after a long time. ||31||

After that, the army traveled further into the forest and stopped near the fifth peak of the Vijayardha mountain. ||32||

Upon their arrival, the army commanders, following the king's orders, established their camps in the forest where the trees swayed gently in the breeze. ||33||

The soldiers, at their own will, set up their camps on the slopes of the Vijayardha mountain, where the dense forest was adorned with falling showers of flowers and thick branches. ||34||

The camps of the soldiers were naturally beautiful, located near the banks of lakes and amidst the groves of creepers. ||35||

Foolish men say that entering the forest is a cause for detachment, but it is actually a cause for increasing attachment for these soldiers. ||36||

Knowing that the king was staying there according to the rules, the lord of the Vijayardha mountain, Vijayardha, a god like the Magadha gods, went to see Bharat. ||37||

He was adorned like another Vijayardha mountain, for just as the Vijayardha mountain is high with its peak, so too was he high with his crown-like peak. Just as the Vijayardha mountain has waterfalls cascading down, so too did he have garlands hanging down his neck like waterfalls. And just as the Vijayardha mountain has a shining middle part, so too did he have a shining bracelet on his arm. ||38||

He was adorned like a standing conch shell, wearing white clothes, garlands, and white sandalwood paste, and carrying a treasure of jewels. ||39||

He approached the emperor with great haste and bowed to him with respect. The emperor, the wielder of the discus, offered him a comfortable seat. ||40|| 

Page #118:

## Adipurana

The mountain guard said, "I have been the protector of this mountain and have resided in its peak. I have been free and independent for a long time, but today I have become your servant, O Lord." (41)

"Know me and this lofty mountain as Vijayardha. We both are mutually dependent and stand firm, unyielding." (42)

"O God, this mountain divides the Digvijaya into two halves, hence it is called Vijayardha. By residing here, I too have acquired the name Vijayardha." (43)

"O Auspicious One, I hold your command like a garland on my head and am like one of your foot soldiers. What more can I ask for?" (44)

Saying this, the deity rose and, along with other gods, performed the coronation of King Bharat with auspicious holy water, announcing his duty, "My duty is to coronate the Digvijaya Chakravartis." (45)

At that time, drums resonated in the sky with a deep sound, and the wind blew gently, shaking the forest paths. (46)

Celestial dancers danced gracefully, moving their eyebrows playfully, and the Kinnaras sang auspicious songs, proclaiming Bharat's victory. (47)

The deity, bestowing blessings for victory, showered Bharat, who had been coronated and was adorned in white garments, with many precious jewels. (48)

He also presented him with a treasure chest of jewels, a white umbrella, two fly whisks, and a divine throne. (49)

Pleased by the above-mentioned honors and humble words, Bharat cast his joyful and playful gaze upon the deity. (50)

Then, Bharat, having honored and dismissed the deity with the words, "Go," the Vijayardha deity, accepting his servitude, returned to his place. (51)

Having conquered the Vijayardha mountain, the entire South India was conquered. Considering it a treasure, the king worshipped the Chakra (wheel) of the mountain. (52) 

Page #119:
---------------------------
101
He continued to perform the Chakra Puja with fragrances, flowers, incense, lamps, water, Akshata, fruits, and divine offerings. ||53|| Even after conquering the Vijayadha mountain, his desire to conquer the northern part remained undiminished. ||54|| Then, returning a little, he stationed his army near the western cave of the Rupayadra mountain, securing the surrounding forest. ||55|| To the south of the Vijayadha mountain, between the two altars of the mountain and the forest, outside the forest on the banks of the Sindhu river, his army was stationed. ||56|| The king considered it worthwhile to stay there for a long time, as there were many wonders to be seen in this earth. ||57|| Even after staying there for a long time, he did not incur any expenses. On the contrary, he was filled like the ocean with the benefits of unprecedented treasures. ||58|| Hearing that he was staying there, the kings from the middle of the earth, residing between the Ganga and Sindhu rivers, came to see him. ||59|| With their heads bowed, their hands clasped, and their crowns swaying, these kings, with great devotion, paid their respects to the king. ||60|| The kings, with great devotion, honored the king with saffron, sandalwood, camphor, gold, pearls, jewels, and other precious things. ||61|| Who can estimate the measure of the jewels that continuously filled his treasury from all directions? ||62|| At that time, the kings of the neighboring countries, with their armies well-protected by their commanders, provided the king's army with straw, fuel, and other necessities for a long time. ||63|| 

Page #120:

102
Some Mandala-adhipas (rulers of kingdoms) came at the behest of the Lord, while others, the valiant warriors, came uninvited. ||65||
"We must go to foreign lands and conquer the Mlechchha (non-Aryan) rulers," thinking thus, the Samantas (vassals) had almost prepared their army equipped with bows and arrows. ||66||
The Dhanurdharas (archers) with their quivers full of arrows of various sizes, seemed to be saying to their masters, "We are your debt-bound servants, and we are ready to serve you in return for your sustenance." ||67||
Many archers, with a roar, were drawing their bows with strings, as if they were trying to pull out the lives of their enemies. ||68||
Some warriors were holding swords in their hands and weighing them, as if they wanted to measure the weight of the honor bestowed upon them by their master. ||69||
"The warriors, adorned with armor and with shining swords, looked like huge serpents with loose skin and flickering tongues." ||70||
Some warriors, with pride, were moving around with swords in their hands and roaring, as if they were seeing their enemies face to face. ||71||
The chariots, filled with fiery arrows, Mahastambhas (large pillars), swords, bows, helmets, and armor, were like moving armories, decorating the streets. ||72||
The charioteers, though carrying heavy weapons on their chariots, were moving with great speed. ||73||

Kings had deployed valiant warriors to protect the feet of the elephants. These young warriors, along with the Kshatriyas, were appointed as protectors. ||7||
The valiant royal youths were appointed as leaders of the infantry. The cavalry, adorned with armor and resembling surging rivers, were also appointed as leaders. ||75||
The kings, having arranged their forces, observed them. The formations of the army, consisting of Dandavyuha, Mandavyuha, Bhogavyuha, and Asanhritavyuha, were well-organized. ||76||
What is the task of this Chakravarti that we, mere mortals, can even remember, let alone accomplish? This devotion of ours, following our master, is what we can do at this time. We should accomplish the task of our master, spread our wealth of glory, drive away the enemy forces, uphold our manhood, see various lands, and obtain numerous blessings of victory. Thus, the warriors were conversing with each other, using praiseworthy examples. ||77-79||
This is a difficult mountain to cross, and there are large rivers to ford in between. Considering these obstacles, many thought it best not to proceed. ||80||
Thus, with various emotions and mutual conversations, they quickly arose and, along with their respective masters, reached the Chakravarti's camp. ||81||
1. A group of horses. 2. Wearing armor. 3. Resembling. 4. Dandavyuha, Mandavyuha, Bhogavyuha, and Asanhritavyuha are the names of four types of formations. Here, the word "Dandavyuha" refers to a linear formation, "Bhogavyuha" refers to a formation that spreads out, "Mandavyuha" refers to a circular formation, and "Asanhritavyuha" refers to a formation that is not organized. 5. Time. 6. Remembered. 7. Following. 8. To be obtained. 9. Said. 10. In the middle. 11. Being without a vehicle or not going. 12. Along with their own masters.

The kings, having filled their storehouses with all kinds of provisions, set out to conquer the Himavat mountain, knowing that the victory would be achieved only after a long time.  ||82|| Some kings marched with warriors wielding clubs, while others were accompanied by loyal servants who looked upon their lord with devotion.  ||83|| From all sides, numerous vassals, each with their own armies, converged and, with a united voice, proclaimed the victory of the king whose rule shone brightly everywhere.  ||84|| Just as the ocean is filled by the confluence of rivers, so too was Bharata's army filled by the multitude of his loyal vassals.  ||85|| Like Mount Meru, adorned with celestial armies during the birth of the Jina, the Vijayardha mountain was surrounded by armies, along with its forests and plains.  ||86|| The peaks of the Vijayardha mountain, adorned with royal pavilions, reflected the splendor of heaven, as they were dominated by Bharata's armies.  ||87|| The army, with its chariots rolling, horses neighing, and elephants trumpeting, filled the Vijayardha mountain with its thunderous roar.  ||88|| The mountain, echoing the sounds of the army through its caves, seemed to groan under the weight of the surrounding forces.  ||89|| In the midst of this, Bharata saw a celestial being descending from the mountain, his radiant crown illuminating the sky.  ||90|| The celestial being, adorned with shining ornaments and garments, descended from the mountain, accompanied by his retinue, as if the forest itself were adorned with jewels and fine cloth.  ||91|| 

Page #123:

105
Was it a divine effulgence spreading in the sky? Or was it a cluster of lightning? Or was it a flame of fire? Thus, with many imaginations, people had seen it for a moment. What was seen at first as a cluster of radiance, was later seen as a distinct human form with the appearance of its limbs. 92-94
The one who was adorned with a garland of Champak flowers to reveal his name, Krtimala, and who appeared like a blooming Krtimala tree, was seen standing before the Chakravarti Bharat. 93-94
Seeing him, with salutations, suddenly, Bharat, with due respect, offered him a seat. 95
Permitted by Bharat, he sat on the seat and, seeing his transcendental effulgence, was astonished for a moment. 96
The king Bharat, who was the first to speak, addressed him, and the god, with humility, spoke as follows. 97
O god, where are we, the insignificant gods, and where are you, the divine human? However, I believe that our divine nature is clearly making us eloquent, that is, compelling us to speak. 98
O Ayushman, we are ashamed to ask about your well-being, because the welfare of the entire world is under your control. 99
Your skill in bringing about the welfare of the world is renowned, and you desire to conquer the entire earth. Is this the skill of your right arm? 100
O god, you are beloved even by the gods, you have conquered the entire world, therefore this divine nature is worthy of you. We are insignificant gods, we are called gods only because we were born in the divine lineage. Here, 'Devanam' and 'Priya' are both separate words, or it could be

**103.**  O King of Kings, the royal epithet, which does not go to anyone else, shines in you. You rule the entire earth, divided into six sections, with its surrounding mountains.

**104.**  O Lord, your unbearable prowess shines through the jewel of the Chakra, and your policy of punishment is renowned through the cunning of the jewel of the Danda.

**105.**  This entire earth is under your control, worthy of being ruled. You are its independent Lord.  Wealth and jewels are your wealth, so who else is as wealthy as you?

**106.**  O Lord, your fame wanders freely and alone throughout the world, and Saraswati is eloquent, yet why are these two women dear to you?

**107.**  We have come here from the heavens to serve you, whose greatness is known, terrified by the roar of your army.

**108.**  O God, we dwell on the peak of this mountain and never move from our place, but we have been brought down to this earth by you.

**109.**  We are the Vyantara, dwelling in many places far and wide. Now make us your servants, who are close to you.

**110.**  Know me as the god Kritamal, who dwells on the peak of this mountain and knows the heart of the Vijay mountain.

**111.**  O God, you have subdued me, so consider this great mountain as your own, for I know the entire interior of this mountain, with its caves and forests.

**112.**  Or, "I know the interior of this mountain" is a very small statement, for there is no place within all the islands and oceans that is beyond our reach.

"Vatasthanavarasthaam" foot-place, small-hole-place, mountain-peak-place.  You should know us, the wandering ones, as all-pervading, all-knowing. || 113 || Thus, with peaceful, powerful words, and with great respect, he offered fourteen ornaments to the god, Bharata. || 114 || Obtaining those ornaments, which were unattainable by others, the Chakravarti attained supreme joy, and the god also attained great joy from the respectful treatment given by the Chakravarti. || 115 || Then, to facilitate the entry of the god into the cave of the mountain for the sake of victory, the Chakravarti sent his commander ahead to open the cave door. || 116 || The Chakravarti said to his commander, "Open the cave door and conquer the western region until the cave is peaceful." || 117 || Thus, carrying the Chakravarti's command like a garland on his head, and knowing all the methods taught by the god Kritamala, the clever commander, with some horses and soldiers, mounted on the horse-jewel, with the staff-jewel in his hand, set out. || 118-119 || After going a short distance, and crossing the forest-altar of the Sindhu river, he reached the altar on the bank of the Vijayardha mountain. || 120 || First, the commander climbed the altar of the Vijayardha mountain by the steps, and then, facing west, he went to the front of the cave. || 121 || Sitting on the horse-jewel, the commander said, "Victory to the Chakravarti!" and struck the cave door with the staff-jewel, making a loud sound. || 122 || When the cave door opened due to the impact of the staff-jewel, a great heat came out from inside. || 123 || The two doors, bearing the sound of the staff-jewel's strike, seemed to be sweating with pain from the heat coming out of the cave. || 124 ||

It did not happen. || 112 || O all-pervading one, you who benefit all, consider us, who dwell on banyan trees, in small pits, on mountain peaks, in the hollows of trees, and in shelters made of leaves, and who wander day and night, as all-pervading. || 113 ||

Adipuranam
Emerging from the gate with its open doors, the mountain king seemed to have taken a breath after a long time. ||125||
A great sound echoed from the opening of the doors, like the cry of a mountain struck by a thunderbolt. ||126||
The heat of the cave did not touch him, carried away as he was by the swift steeds, protected by the gods. ||127||
From the sky, the eyes of the celestial women showered him with flowers, like the laughter of victory. ||128||
He crossed the platform with steps, like a silver mountain, and approached the western forest platform of the Sindhu river, adorned with a torana. ||129||
Crossing that platform, he entered the great land, adorned with mines, cities, villages, boundaries, and gardens. ||130||
As soon as he entered, the people of that land were terrified, and many of them, along with their wives and cattle, prepared to flee. ||131||
Some wise and brave men, with offerings of sacred rice and other things, went to meet the king and his army, and welcomed him. ||132||
"Do not fear, do not fear, stay as you please," the servants of the Chakravarti reassured the people, as they went around. ||133||
The king, who held the unbroken command, circumambulated the Mlechchha land, and at every place, he had the Mlechchha kings accept the Chakravarti's command. ||134||
He taught the Mlechchha kings, "This is the land of the Chakravarti, and he is near. Hurry, all of you, with your armies, to serve him. Bharat, the first king of this age, is the most important king, and his command, which cannot be broken, should be held on your heads." ||135-136|| 

Page #127:
---------------------------
The thirty-first parva has arrived, and we are now free from sorrow after a long time, so many wise people, giving blessings loudly, accepted the command of the Chakravarti. ||137|| Those who had shown their prowess in the six qualities of *sandi*, *vigraha*, *yana*, etc., and who had become intoxicated by a little bit of wealth, were forced to bow down by the commander. ||138|| The commander subdued many Mlechchha kings who were living in forts, by preventing their movement in all directions. This is right, because ignorant people become humble only when they are subjected to much suffering. ||139|| Many kings, surrounded by armies, were unable to bear the suffering caused by them, and so they remained under the rule of the Chakravarti. This is right, because without being pressed, *khal* (wicked person) does not produce *sneha* (love). ||140|| In this way, the commander, knowing the ways and means, subdued the Mlechchha kings by various means, and from them he received many jewels, including daughters, fit for the enjoyment of the Chakravarti. ||141|| These people are considered Mlechchhas because they are devoid of *dharma* and *karma*. Except for *dharma* and *karma*, they are similar to those born in the *Aryavarta* in other ways. ||142|| Thus, having subdued that land devoid of *dharma* and *karma*, the commander returned with the army of the Mlechchha kings. ||143|| The commander of the Rajaraja, who had conquered the directions, whose nature it is to conquer all, and who was adorned with horses and jewels, was shining as if he were a living embodiment of prowess. ||144|| Crossing the *torana* (gateway) of the forest of the Sindhu river, he climbed the *vedika* (altar) of the forest of the Vijayaparvata, which was adorned with steps. ||145|| With a broad chest and long arms, he climbed the *vedika* of the mountain and stayed at the entrance of the cave, whose heat had been pacified in six months. ||146|| Staying there, he purified the interior of the cave, which was full of many obstacles, and then, having made proper arrangements for its protection, he returned to the camp of the lord. ||147||

The Adipurana

Then, approaching from the front, the commander was greeted by the best of kings, accompanied by their armies, with the sound of victory drums. ||148|| Crossing the great street, adorned with many high toranas and flying banners, he entered the king's camp. ||149|| The skilled commander dismounted from his horse at a distance and reached the assembly hall where the lord was seated. ||150|| With his head bowed and hands clasped, he bowed to the lord, watched by the astonished assembly. ||151|| The Mlechcha kings, with their faces full of joy and fear, bowed to the lord, touching the ground with their foreheads. ||152|| The commander, presenting the jewels and other gifts brought by them, introduced them to the lord by name. ||153|| The lord, pleased, honored and received them well. Then, with the lord's permission, they returned to their own places. ||154|| Thus, the Chakravarti, by the rise of his virtuous deeds, had conquered the Mlechcha kings by force, using only the weapon of justice. For where is victory without virtue? ||155||

Then, the commander, who had been honored by the assembly of kings, who had conquered all the forts, who had humbled the Mlechcha kings, who was adorned with the insignia of victory, and who was honored with the signs of victory, was appointed by the lord Bharat, the master of jewels, to the post of commander-in-chief for further victory. ||156|| The rule of the Jina-varas is victorious, for by their grace, this position of authority is obtained with ease. It is a treasure of wealth, a kingdom, and the enjoyment of pleasures, revealing the essence of happiness, and a vast spread of wealth. ||157||

What means did the Chakravarti use to return to his camp? ||147|| When the commander arrived there, many excellent kings, with their armies, went to meet him and welcomed him with the sound of victory drums. ||148|| He crossed the great street, adorned with many high toranas and flying banners, and entered the king's camp. ||149|| The skilled commander dismounted from his horse at a distance and reached the assembly hall where the lord was seated. ||150|| With his head bowed and hands clasped, he bowed to the lord, watched by the astonished assembly. ||151|| The Mlechcha kings, with their faces full of joy and fear, bowed to the lord, touching the ground with their foreheads. ||152|| The commander, presenting the jewels and other gifts brought by them, introduced them to the lord by name. ||153|| The lord, pleased, honored and received them well.

The Thirty-First Chapter of the Shardulavikridita:

**Verse 158:**
The glorious King Bharata, having conquered the lord of the Vijayardha mountain, received from him a beautiful umbrella that reflected the laughter of the moon's rays, two charming chamaras (fly whisks) with golden, radiant staffs, their brilliance like the foam of the Ganga River, a throne like the peak of Mount Meru, separated from its base, and many other precious jewels.

**Verse 159:**
The divine being known as "Kritamal" honored King Bharata with offerings, but there is no object in this Bharata-kshetra that can be compared to them. Adorned with those incomparable ornaments, and seated on a throne of jewels, King Bharateshwara shone like a blossoming Kalpa tree on the peak of Mount Meru.

**Conclusion:**
Thus ends the thirty-first chapter of the Trishattilakshana Mahapurana, a work composed by the revered Jinaseanacharya, known as the "Aarsha," which describes the opening of the cave on Vijayardha mountain.

## Thirty-Second Chapter

The commanders, eager and fully prepared, awaited the Emperor's departure.  [1]

The courtyard of the King was filled with elephants, horses, chariots, and foot soldiers.  Even the forests of Vijayardha mountain were overflowing. [2]

Mounted on his victorious elephant, surrounded by noble kings, the Emperor shone like Indra on Airavata, surrounded by the gods, as he set out for victory. [3]

The army of Bharat, moving slightly westward, was compressed by the commander onto the purified path, as if it had itself attained purity. [4]

Just as the purity of the monks ascends the steps of the excellent Gunasthanas (the eighth, ninth, and tenth steps of the Upasama or Kshapaka श्रेणी), so too did the Emperor's army ascend the श्रेणी of Vijayardha mountain, adorned with excellent steps. [5]

There was a cave called Tamisa, equal in length to the width of the mountain, eight yojanas high, and twelve yojanas wide. It held two vajra-made doors, each six yojanas wide, as tall as the cave itself. The door frame was adorned with precious jewels, radiating brilliance. The cave was graced by the flow of the Sindhu river emerging from its base.  No one could open it except the commander, who had already opened it, and it had become calm, cooled by the release of its inner heat.  Though it was as ancient as the creation of the world, it appeared as if it had been made by someone. [6-9] 

Page #131:
---------------------------
## Thirty-Second Chapter

The cave, like the world, was created by someone. It was considered by the monks to be like the Jain scriptures, deep and profound. It was as long as the desire to live, as dark as unconsciousness, and as healthy as someone who has recovered from illness and whose insides have been cleansed. It was like a delivery room, where no one except the Chakravarti's army was allowed to enter. It was guarded by all means of protection, and auspicious objects were placed near it.

Seeing this, the Chakravarti's army was terrified from afar. The cave was filled with a darkness so dense that even a needle could not pierce it, like a thick layer of kohl.

The commander, instructed by the Chakravarti, along with the priest, tried to find a way out of the darkness. They marked a distance of one yojana on both sides of the cave walls with Kakini and Chudamani gems. They drew the circles of the sun and moon.

The light from these circles, shining brightly with the combined radiance of the sun and moon, dispelled the darkness within the cave. The army then entered the middle of the cave.

The Chakravarti's army, led by the commander, marched forward with the Chakra Ratna, a brilliant lamp, illuminating the way. The army then split into two parts and continued along the same path.

The army, avoiding the flow of the Sindhu River, marched along both the eastern and western paths, using the water of the Sindhu River.

As they marched along these two paths, controlled by the commander, the army was faced with a two-fold doubt. They were unsure which direction was east and which was west.

Then, after traveling through many places with abundant grass and water, the king... 

Page #132:

114,
Adipurana... Where the Umagnajala river enters the Sindhu river, flowing alongside the Nimagnajala river, which also flows into the Sindhu, the army of the emperor reached that place. ||21|| Emperor Bharateshwara, having stationed his army on the banks of both rivers, observed the disparity between them with curiosity. ||22|| One, the Nimagnajala, swiftly carries down wood and other objects, while the other, the Umagnajala, quickly throws everything upwards. Although they are opposites, they somehow meet at the Sindhu river. ||23|| Pondering how to cross these rivers, the emperor swiftly summoned his architect, the Silavat Ratna. ||24|| Seeing the water of both rivers rising and falling, the Silavat Ratna, with a mere glance, considered them as insignificant as a handful of water. ||25|| He understood that the Umagnajala river is pushed upwards by the great wind residing beneath it, and the Nimagnajala river is pulled downwards by the great wind residing above it. ||26|| Thinking that there is no other way to build a bridge over these two rivers, the Silavat Ratna, like a skilled physician, began the process of constructing a bridge. ||27|| He summoned, through his divine power, the great trees from the uninhabited forests. (Meaning: He summoned the great trees from the dense forests through his subordinate deities.) ||28|| Using strong wood, he erected sturdy pillars within the water and built a bridge over them. ||29|| Fearing that the army would suffer due to the long time it would take, the Silavat Ratna, a man of great intellect, built the bridge in an instant, following the emperor's command. ||30|| As the bridge was completed, the army rejoiced with a clamor, and at that very moment, the entire army of the emperor crossed over to the other side of the rivers. ||31||

## The Thirty-Second Festival

**32.** Surrounded by a multitude of elephants and accompanied by 115 heroes, the Lord (Bharata) crossed the watery path.

**33.** After traveling for some time, he reached the northern gate of the mountain fortress (difficult path) and stayed there.

**34.** Having crossed the open gate, cleared by the eastern army, the Lord resided in the forest land of the Vijaya mountain.

**35.** Staying for a long time in the warm cave, like a mother's womb, the soldiers who emerged from it felt as if they had been reborn.

**36.** The cave, having swallowed this multitude of people, seemed to be spitting them out again, as if it had lost the power to digest them.

**37.** The wind, like a fan with branches, was blowing through the forest, comforting the army, which had been distressed by the heat of the cave for a long time.

**38.** The forest, adorned with seasonal fruits and flowers, swayed in the wind, as if it were dancing with its branches, rejoicing at the arrival of the Lord.

**39.** Having conquered the western Mlechchha region, as before, the Lord, with his army, set out to conquer the middle Mlechchha region.

**40.** Just as the sun, with its rays, scorches people, dries up the earth's moisture, and makes people suffer, the Lord, though he had emerged in the north like the sun, did not oppress people with his power, did not dry up the earth's joy, and did not cause suffering to the people.

**41.** The sun, situated in the north, burns with its rays, but King Bharata removed the suffering of the earth.

**42.** The armies of Bharata, arranged in various formations and united with each other, did not wander far from their positions, nor did they move freely.

## Chapter 116

The invincible Chakravarti conquered many forts, subdued kings who were considered unconquerable, and besieged enemy countries. (43)

One should not engage in battle with the powerful, protect those who seek refuge, and strive to protect one's own land. This is the conduct of a king who desires victory. (44)

Thus, the Chakravarti, whose army and prowess were unmatched, followed the Chakra Ratna and subjugated vast territories with his own forces. (45)

Meanwhile, two Mlechchha kings, named Chilata and Avarta, heard of the defeat of their army at the hands of the enemy. (46)

The appearance of the enemy army in our land is unprecedented. We must resist this calamity. With this thought, the two Mlechchha kings met. (47)

Then, the armies of both kings, consisting mainly of archers and equipped with elephants and horses, converged from different directions. (48)

Both kings, eager for war, became enraged and, displaying their prowess, challenged the Chakravarti's army with a desire to conquer. (49)

At this juncture, wise, courageous, and successful ministers advised the two kings, dissuading them from engaging in battle, and spoke these words of wisdom: (50)

O Kings, those who desire success should not act without deliberation, for the success of those who act without deliberation is far removed. (51)

Who is this king who has stopped our army? Where did he come from? How strong is his army? Without considering all these factors, we should not engage with his army in any way. (52)

This is no ordinary man who has crossed the mountain of victory. He is either a god or possesses divine power, there is no doubt about it. (53)

## Thirty-Second Chapter
117
Then, the commencement of war was anticipated, and the taking refuge in a fort was considered.  A great enemy can be easily conquered by those who take refuge in a fort. 54 || This land of ours, from the Himalayas to the banks of the Ganga and the Sindhu, is naturally like a fort. Who can conquer it? Who can defeat it? 55 || And another thing, there are deities who are worthy of our lineage, namely Nagameghmukha, who will surely stop the enemies. 56 || Thus, inspired by the words of their ministers, the two kings, desiring victory, immediately remembered the deities and performed worship. 57 || Then, those deities, assuming the form of clouds, roared loudly and showered rain with strong winds, consuming the winds. 58 || The water poured down by the clouds flooded the army of the Jains, flowing up and down and all around. 59 || Although the rain was so heavy that it filled the space between the sky and the earth, creating a sea outside, there was not even a drop of rain in the emperor's camp that could wet a piece of cloth. 60 || At that time, the emperor's army was covered above by the Chatraratna and below by the Charmaratna. Surrounded by these two gems, the army appeared as if it were sewn together on all sides, that is, the Charmaratna and the Chatraratna were sewn together on all sides, enclosing the army in the middle. 61 || In that flood of water, the emperor's army remained within the two gems for seven days, and at that time it appeared like an egg. 62 || The emperor's army, residing in that egg-shaped tent, twelve yojanas long and wide, illuminated by the Chakra Ratna, was free from all suffering. 63 || In that large tent, four doors were divided in all directions, the interior was protected by the commander-in-chief, and Jayakumar was protecting the army from outside. 64 || At that time, Silavat Ratna had prepared many kinds of cloth tents, large thatched huts, and chariots that could travel in the sky. 65 ||

Hearing the commotion outside, the kings asked, "What is this?" and, enraged, they raised their hands towards their swords. ||66|| Then, at the command of the Chakravarti, the gods bound to the Gan, enraged, drove away the Naga-mukhas with their roars in an instant. ||67|| The mighty Kuru king, Jayakumar, also, seated on his divine chariot, roared like a lion and conquered the Naga-mukhas with divine weapons. ||68|| At that time, in the battlefield, showering arrows incessantly, he, adorned with armor, shone like a rain cloud. ||69|| The blazing arrows released by Jayakumar shone in the battlefield, as if they were lamps lit to see the hidden Naga-mukhas. ||70|| Then, having conquered the Naga-mukhas and the Megha-mukhas, he, having attained the name Megheshvara, returned from the battle. ||71|| At that time, Jayakumar, roaring like thunder before a downpour, conquered the Megha-mukhas with his fierce roar and became known as Megheshvara. ||72|| The gods, whose ears were deafened by the sound of the drums that resounded repeatedly, were pleased with his valor and celebrated his victory. ||73|| Then, seeing his valor, the Chakravarti praised him repeatedly and, honoring him, appointed him to the position of the chief warrior. ||74|| As if by magic, when the trouble caused by the Naga-mukhas ceased, the army of Bharata regained its strength, that is, they began to experience happiness after the trouble was averted. ||75|| When the army of Naga-mukhas fled, both the Mlechchha kings, Chilata and Avarta, became weak and, terrified, approached the feet of the Chakravarti and bowed down. ||76|| They atoned for their offenses by giving Bharata much wealth and wealth in the form of fame and, saying, "O God, be pleased," they accepted their servitude. ||77||

## Thirty-Second Chapter

116. The first Nidhipati-Chakravarti, making the entire earth free from enemies, again set out with his forces towards the banks of the Himalayas. ||7||

While traveling, the Lord of the Earth, with his victorious elephants, plowed the land on the banks of the Sindhu River. When he reached the Sindhu waterfall, he was consecrated by the Sindhu Devi. ||7||

Knowing that the victorious one had arrived near her abode, the Devi, with her family and adorned with jewels, came to meet him. ||8||

With her own hands, she consecrated the Maharaja Bharat, seated on the Bhadraasana, with the holy water of the Sindhu River, filled in hundreds of golden pots. ||8||

After the consecration, the Devi, adorned with auspicious garments and ornaments, blessed the Maharaja Bharat with victory and said, "O Lord, I am purified by your sight today." ||8||

Receiving the divine Bhadraasana given by the Sindhu Devi, Bharat set out on his journey, and the Sindhu Devi followed him for some distance. ||83||

Reaching the Himalayas, he conquered its banks and, after many stops, reached the vicinity of the Himvat-Kuta. ||84||

There, he fasted with his priest, worshipped the divine weapons, and slept on a pure bed. ||85||

Considering that the worship of weapons was a ritual and not a sign of weakness, the kings, who honored him, saw that Bharat, without effort, strung his bow, called Vajrakanḍa. ||86||

He then placed his divine, infallible arrow, marked with the letters of his name, on the bow, and took his position in the Vaishakha stance. ||87||

When Bharat, with a roar like a lion, released the arrow, the group of gods, pleased, showered him with flower garlands. ||88||

1. The best Nidhipati.
2. The banks of the Sindhu River.
3. Plowing.
4. The Sindhu River waterfall.
5. Arriving.

16. With the string.
17. Strung.
18. Standing in the Vaishakha stance.
19. By the wielder of the wheel.

The arrow, whose motion never faltered, flew upwards, reaching the abode of the gods residing on the peak of the Himalayas, shaking the very structure of their dwelling. ||89|| The Magadha god, understanding the arrival of the Chakravarti, bowed his head in reverence. ||90|| The god, having restrained his anger, touched the bowstring and reached the place where the Chakravarti was seated. ||91|| He said to Bharata, "O god, this Himalayan peak is very high and cannot be crossed by ordinary mortals. Yet, you have crossed it today, making your character extraordinary, surpassing that of ordinary humans." ||92|| "O god, where are our abodes, so far away, and where is your arrow? Yet, this arrow, upon falling, has shaken us all at once." ||93|| "O god, your prowess, through the guise of the arrow, seems to be leaping in the sky, as if calling us, the bound gods (a type of celestial army under the Chakravarti), to be appointed to the position of gods." ||94|| "Your victorious endeavor, having conquered the ocean and invaded the caves of the Vijayardha mountain, is now spreading to the peaks of the Himalayas." ||95|| "O lord, your complete conquest of the directions is already accomplished. Therefore, O victorious one, may your victory be everlasting, may you be prosperous, and may you continue to grow. This praise is a repetition of your glory." ||96|| Thus speaking, the god, filled with the words "victory, victory," along with many other gods, began to serve Bharata with all kinds of offerings. ||97|| And, according to the proper procedure for kings, he performed the coronation of the king of kings, Bharata, and presented him with sandalwood called Goshirsh, along with a collection of medicinal herbs. ||98|| And he said, "O god, these gods residing in your domain, desiring your favor, bow their heads from afar, offering you salutations." ||99||

**100.**  "O Dev, cast your benevolent and playful gaze upon us. For the favor of the master is the livelihood of the servants." 

**101.**  "O Master, you are worthy of honoring us with proper instructions. For servants consider the receipt of instructions from their master to be even more valuable than the receipt of livelihood."

**102.**  Bharata, praising those words, honored all those excellent Devas, and dismissed them, having brought them under his control.

**103.**  At that time, the Kinnara Devas, with their voices rising and falling at will, were singing auspicious songs in the groves of that mountain, proclaiming, "Bharata has conquered Himavan."

**104.**  At that time, the wind of the Himavan forest was blowing gently, repeatedly stirring the garments covering the breasts of the Kinnara women, and breaking the waves of the lakes.

**105.**  The saffron dust, born from the forests of the terrestrial lotuses, was spreading all around, and the cool wind, coming from the groves of the Himavan, was serving Maharaja Bharata.

**106.**  Bharata's fame, earned through conquest of the directions, was spreading in the groves of the Himavan, along with Jayashri, like the terrestrial lotuses.

**107.**  Bharata was very pleased, seeing all around him in the regions of the Himavan, those who had performed the act of offering flowers, with their voices like the terrestrial lotuses.

**108.**  That Himavan was like Bharata himself, for just as Bharata was of high conduct, so too was that mountain very high. Just as Bharata had filled all directions with his brilliance, so too had that mountain filled all directions with its expanse. Just as Bharata possessed excellent future prospects, so too did that mountain possess length. And just as Bharata possessed many treasures, so too did that mountain possess many treasures. Thus, that Himavan, being similar to Bharata...

In the meantime, the king Bharat was looking at the mountain, admiring its beauty. The purohita, wishing to entertain him, spoke these words:

101
O King, this Himavan mountain is very high, always adorned with beauty, and is the best among the Kulakshonibhrit mountains. Therefore, it imitates you, as you are also high-minded, always adorned with the beauty of your kingdom, and the best among the kings who have come from a long lineage.

110
Oh, how wonderful this mountain is! It is difficult to climb and even more difficult to cross. But, by your grace, it has become accessible to us, just by placing an arrow on a string.

111
Its golden chain is adorned with various jewels, and it is a hundred yojanas high. It appears as if it were built by a skilled craftsman.

112
This mountain, which enters the salt ocean from its eastern and western sides, appears as if it were a measuring rod for the earth.

113
O best of the Bharatas, this great mountain is twice the size of the Bharat region, and its base, middle, and top are all of equal width.

114
On every peak of this mountain, there is a beautiful forest, where Siddhas, Vidyadharas, and Naga-Kumaras reside permanently.

115
The shores of this mountain are adorned with glittering jewels, and they appear as if they were painted with the reflections of celestial nymphs.

116
On the shores of this mountain, which are suitable for enjoying oneself at will, Vidyadharas are strolling with their beloved wives.

117
The celestial beings, along with their Apsaras, enjoy themselves on the secluded, sacred, and beautiful shores of this mountain, and they find no satisfaction anywhere else.

118
The mountain Bharat was highly respected, looked upon with reverence.

108
In the meantime, while King Bharat was gazing at the Himavan mountain, admiring its beauty, the purohita, wishing to entertain him, spoke these words:

The forest regions on its edges, adorned with blooming flowers, seem to be laughing, as if they were the laughter of the gardens of the gods, with their own beauty. ||119||
This mountain bears on its head (peak) the beauty that is eternal and imperishable, which the wise remember as the pride of Indraani, the one that removes arrogance. ||120||
On its peak, there is a lake called Padma, where the goddess Shri resides, whose glory has been described extensively by the scriptures, filled with clear water, and adorned with blooming golden lotuses. ||121||
This mountain bears the great rivers Ganga and Sindhu, which flow out from the eastern and western gates of this Padma lake. ||122||
And it also bears the river Rohitasya, which flows out from the northern gate of the Padma lake, towards the north. ||123||
This mountain is adorned with these three uncrossable great rivers, as if it were displaying its own nature as a king of the earth, with the three powers of enthusiasm, mantra, and dominion. ||124||
With its shining peaks, which encompass the directions, this mountain seems to be nailing the sky-like courtyard, as if it were blocking the path of the Siddhas. ||125||
On this mountain king, there are many abodes of the gods, which, with their beauty, even make the great beauty of heaven laugh. ||126||
Even though this mountain has many virtues, it has one great flaw, and that is that, being great itself, it bears on its sides smaller trees, which are not great. ||127||
This mountain bears the resemblance of the world-teacher, Lord Rishabhadeva, because just as Lord Rishabhadeva is exalted by his uncrossable glory, so too is this mountain exalted by its uncrossable glory. And just as Lord Rishabhadeva has encompassed the entire world with his greatness, so too has this mountain encompassed the entire world with its heaviness. ||128||
Meaning: Just as the greatness of Lord Rishabhadeva is famous throughout the world, so too is the heaviness of this mountain famous throughout the world.

The purohita praised the mountain's beauty in high tones. The king of the Bharatas, pleased, also praised the mountain.  He praised the Himavan, the boundary of his realm, and out of curiosity, returned to see the Vrishabhachal.

This mountain, a hundred yojanas high, is as wide as its base, and at its peak, half as wide, rising like the crown of the earth. Its pleasant slopes are adorned with groves of banana trees, fit for the enjoyment of the celestial beings and the Vidyadharas. It is surrounded by Nagas, Sahajanas, and Nagakeshar trees, and its surrounding forests are frequented by the gods, who never leave them. Its face, shining with the brilliance of crystal stones, covers all directions, and its body seems to be made of autumn clouds, always accompanied by gods and Vidyadharas. Seeing this mountain, like an ornament of the world, the glorious Bharata considered it a reflection of his own glory.

Seeing this mountain, which is white in color and will never perish until the end of the Kalpa, the king Bharata was overjoyed, considering it a heap of his own glory. At that time, the mountain seemed to be welcoming the emperor Bharata, who destroys the fortune of all his enemies, as he approached, with the wind of the forest blowing all around. Bharata also heard his own pure glory sung by the Vidyadharas, Nagakumaras, and Kinnara gods, who were resting near the edge of the mountain.

The Chakravarti was delighted to see the walls of the Vrishabhachal, which were like a auspicious mirror to see the faces of Nirjala and Vijayalakshmi. || 139 ||
The Chakravarti Bharat was very pleased to write his name on the stone walls of the mountain. || 140 ||
When the Chakravarti Bharat took a Kakini gem to write something there, he saw the names of thousands of Chakravarti kings written there. || 141 ||
Seeing the Vrishabhachal filled with the names of countless Chakravartis who had passed through in countless kalpas, Bharat was amazed. || 142 ||
Then, the Chakravarti, whose pride had somewhat subsided, was amazed and did not consider the earth of Bharatavarsha to be under the sole rule of anyone. Meaning - Seeing the names of countless Chakravartis written on the walls of Vrishabhachal, Bharat's pride was destroyed and he accepted that there have been many powerful kings like me on the earth of Bharatavarsha. || 143 ||
The Chakravarti Bharat himself erased the inscription of the name of one Chakravarti and in doing so, he considered almost the whole world to be self-interested. || 144 ||
Then, the Chakravarti, whose wealth was fame, wrote a praiseworthy inscription on the smooth stone slab, like the palm of his hand, with the following words. || 145 ||
Salutations to the Ikshvaku dynasty, which is like the moon in the sky, and I am Bharat, the lord of the earth in all four directions, I am the eldest son of my mother who had a hundred sons, I am glorious, I have humbled all the Vidyadhara gods and earthly kings, I am the son of the creator god Vrishabhadeva, I am Manu, I am respected, I am a warrior, I am pure, I am a holder of excellent intellect, I am the last of the lineage, I am a brave hero, I am the first among the Chakravartis, and besides this, the victorious one who has circumambulated the entire earth during his conquest, that is, who has attacked the entire earth, who has eighteen crore horses that can travel on land and water, who has eighty-four lakh intoxicated elephants in his victorious army, whose conquest has raised the dust of the entire universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust of the universe, whose victory has blocked the sky with the dust

Whose fame, as pure as the moon's rays, shines brightly in all directions, is sung repeatedly by the gods in the midst of the Kula mountains. ||15|| Whose victorious armies, weary from following the wheel, rested at the foot of the Himalayas, having conquered all directions. ||152|| The son of Shri Vrishabhadeva, the grandson of Shri Nabhiraj, who ruled over the entire earth adorned with six continents. ||153|| Considering this mortal earth as a fleeting Lakshmi, he established his eternal fame on this mountain, having conquered all kings. ||154|| Thus, the Chakravarti himself inscribed his own praise with his own hand, while the gods showered him with flowers. ||155|| There, resounding drums boomed loudly, while the gods in the heavens proclaimed their blessings in hundreds of voices. ||156|| The gentle wind, carrying the essence of the sun and the fragrance of the Kalpa trees, blew softly, bringing the sweet scent of Mandara flowers. ||157|| The inscription of Bharat's name was not only on the stone wall, but also on the moon's disc, disguised as a dark mark. ||158|| This inscription serves as a witness to the enjoyment of the land, as declared in the decree. The gods are witnesses to the fact that the land conquered by the Chakravarti is his eternal possession. ||159|| Oh, what a great and powerful Chakravarti he is, who conquered all directions, having invaded the entire earth, from the three oceans in the east, west, and south. ||160|| Even the mountain of victory, which is not meant to be crossed, was easily overcome by him. His fame, like a mountain, is firmly established on this earth. ||161||

---------------------------
The thirty-second chapter, as seen in the scriptures, was praised by the celestial beings. By fortune, the celestial beings, along with their consorts and steeds, were increasing his glory. (162) Further encouraged by the gods, the king, not diminishing his efforts of victory, went towards the Gangapaat (where the Ganga river flows from the Himalayas), as if called by its sounds. (163) The droplets of water from the flowing Ganga, mixed with the drops of the elephants' intoxication, were like a playful shower, as if they wanted to sprinkle each other. (164) The king, whose curiosity was increasing with the whirlpools of the falling Ganga water, was welcomed by the Ganga Devi, who was holding an offering at the Gangapaat. (165) The Ganga Devi seated the Chakravarti Bharat on the throne, facing the east, and then anointed him with the cool, pleasant waters of the Ganga, which had the radiance of the moon's smile. (166) After the completion of the anointment, which was filled with auspicious music, blessings, and the sounds of trumpets, the victorious Bharat received all the garments and ornaments from the Ganga Devi. (167) Then, the Ganga Devi presented Bharat with a throne, whose radiance filled the sky with the brilliance of gems, and which resembled the peak of Mount Meru, adorned with a rainbow. (168) And then, saying, "May you, O King Bharat, always prosper, live long, and be joyful, or be prosperous," the Ganga Devi, after being dismissed by the king, disappeared. (169) 

After that, while traveling along the banks of the Ganga, Bharat was served by the kings of many countries, as well as by the wind, which carried the droplets of the Ganga water. (170) The wind from the forest, coming from behind, reached the Chakravarti, in the areas near the forests on the banks of the Ganga. (171)

Adipurana
In the forest, the groups of hair of the women of the forest dwellers were being blown about by the wind. The peacocks of the forest were dancing, their tails repeatedly striking the heads of the bees. The fragrant creepers of the forest were swaying gently, and the wind, cooled by the touch of the mountain springs, was blowing all around. 
The kings who lived in those lands, subdued by the victorious army, were paying homage to the Lord at every encampment. 
Having conquered the entire land of North Bharata, the victorious King Bharata returned to the foothills of the Vijayadhvaja mountain. 
There, he stationed his army and commanded his general, "Open the door of the cave and quickly conquer the eastern region." 
Six months passed pleasantly for King Bharata while his general was away, conquering the Mlechchha kings. 
The Vidyadharas, who lived on the southern and northern slopes of the Vijayadhvaja mountain, came to see King Bharata, along with their respective lords. 
The Vidyadhara kings, bowing their heads from afar, accepted the command of King Bharata as if it were inscribed on their foreheads. (The rays of King Bharata's feet falling on the foreheads of the Vidyadhara kings as they bowed, made it seem as if they were carrying the command of King Bharata on their foreheads.) 
Nami and Vinami, both kings of the Vidyadharas, approached King Bharata with the treasures of their kingdom. 
King Bharata was greatly pleased with the unique treasures of the Vidyadhara kingdom, which were brought as gifts by Nami and Vinami. 
Just as the ocean is filled by the flow of rivers, so too was King Bharata's desire fulfilled by the gifts of Nami and Vinami, which included a treasure of gems, headed by the gem of a maiden. 
The glorious Bharata married the excellent maiden named Subhadra, the sister of King Nami, with auspicious ceremonies. 
Who was happy?

Having obtained the beautiful Subhadra, like a stream of nectar, the Chakravarti considered his birth fruitful, filled with supreme bliss. ||184||

Having conquered the entire force of the Mlechcha kings with his armies, the victorious general, with Jayalakshmi in the forefront, approached the Lord. ||185||

Honoring the general who had accomplished his task, and bidding farewell to the Mlechcha leaders, the Emperor, accompanied by his retinue, prepared to return to the southern land. ||186||

At that time, the war drums, announcing the victorious march, resounded, stirring the ocean of armies belonging to the kings. ||187||

The victorious army of the Chakravarti, led by the Chakra Ratna, entered the renowned cave called Kandakaprapata, which had been opened beforehand. ||188||

The army crossed the cave, which had been opened by the general, through the two grand avenues on either side of the Ganga River. ||189||

The cave, vacated by the army, seemed to exhale after a long time, and the army, emerging from the confines of the cave, seemed to come back to life. ||190||

There, the celestial being named Natyamala, with full pitchers and other auspicious offerings, and with an offering of gems, welcomed the Lord at the entrance of the cave. ||191||

Honoring the celestial being named Natyamala, who praised him in various ways, the Lord of the Bharatas, with a smile, allowed him to depart to his own abode. ||192||

The celestial beings, armed with bows and arrows, surrounded the sky, serving the Chakravarti who, like the sun, rose beyond darkness. ||193||

The king of the celestial beings, accompanied by Nimi and Vinimi, and others, emerged from the cave of the Vijayardha mountain, dispelling the darkness within, illuminating the directions with his rays like the sun, and delighting all living beings. ||194||

The gentle breeze, carrying a sweet fragrance, blew softly, and the camps of the Lord of the Treasures, situated in the valleys, appeared as if they were coming alive. ||195||

The celestial beings performed a marriage ceremony, with auspicious rituals, for the worthy Vidhyadhara. ||183||

The wind, which had pierced through the clusters of tender leaves of the deodar trees, and had stirred the drops of water from the Ganges, and which had carried the fragrance of the silken garments worn by the celestial nymphs, was gently blowing through the caves of the Vijayadh mountain. At that time, the encampment of the army of the Lord of Treasures, the Chakravarti, was being set up.

**196**

The wind, which had pierced through the clusters of tender leaves of the deodar trees, and had stirred the drops of water from the Ganges, and which had carried the fragrance of the silken garments worn by the celestial nymphs, was gently blowing through the caves of the Vijayadh mountain. At that time, the encampment of the army of the Lord of Treasures, the Chakravarti, was being set up.

**197**

The commander, who had conquered the entire Mlechchha territory with his victorious armies, and who had brought back the goddess of victory, stood before the Lord of Treasures, Bharat, with his head bowed. At that time, Bharat appeared like a Jina, for just as the goddess of victory always resides near a Jina, so too did she always reside near him.

**198**

Having conquered the Mlechchha kings, Chilat and Anart, and having subdued the lord of the Himalayas, Himavan, in a short time, and having received salutations from the goddesses Ganga and Sindhu, and having accepted the two divine seats offered by them, and having conquered the Vijayadh mountain as a mere pastime, and having conquered the kings in its vicinity, he, along with his commander, conquered the entire earth, adorned with six continents.

**199**

The Chakravarti Bharat, whose hand or tax inspires fear in the hearts of his enemies, had brought the entire earth under his control, from the Himalayas in the east to the southern ocean, and from the southern ocean to the western ocean, by the power of his Chakra jewel. Therefore, wise people should always strive to accumulate merit by remaining steadfast in the Jain faith.

**Thus ends the thirty-second chapter of the Trishattilakshana Mahapurana, composed by the Acharya Bhagavata Jinaseena, which narrates the conquest of Bharat in the latter half.**

## The Thirty-Third Chapter

The glorious Chakravarti Bharat, who has subdued all kings, Vidyadharas, and Devas, and has achieved victory in all directions, returned to his Ayodhya city. ||1||

This great king Bharat had acquired nine Nidhis (treasures) and fourteen precious jewels. All the kings of the six continents, along with the Vidyadharas, were under his control. ||2||

Having conquered this entire earth, whose boundary is the salty ocean, the Chakravarti set out for his Ayodhya city. ||3||

His army, with its waves of fluttering chowries and shining umbrellas, emerged from the shore of the Vijayardha mountain, like the Ganges. ||4||

With elephant-like ships, horse-like waves, and human-like ripples, the army, like a vast ocean, spread in all directions, making a great noise. ||5||

The sound of the rolling chariot wheels, the neighing of horses, and the roaring of elephants created a cacophony, a single sound everywhere. ||6||

The auspicious drums, announcing the departure, sounded like thunder, causing the Shikhandi warriors to fear a storm. ||7||

The group of horses was stopped by the advancing elephants, and the group of foot soldiers was stopped by the moving chariots. ||8||

The horses, elephants, and chariots, obstructed by the foot soldiers, moved slightly to the side and continued on their way. ||9||

The Chakravarti, whose crown slightly swayed and whose radiance was like that of Indra, mounted the elephant named Vijay Parvat, which was as tall as a mountain, and set out. ||10||

The Chakravarti's army, following the banks of the Ganges, crossed many countries, rivers, and mountains, and reached the vicinity of Mount Kailash. ||11|| 

Page #150:
---------------------------
132
Having seen Mount Kailasa from afar, the chariot-bearer [Bharata] stationed his army nearby and proceeded to worship the Jina. ||12||  Following him, the kings of the earth, with their shining crowns, went after him, like the gods following the lord of the Sudharma heaven. ||13||  Approaching it quickly, its radiance like autumn clouds, the king of men rejoiced, as if he had seen a mountain of the Jina's glory. ||14||  With the sound of falling waterfalls, it seemed as if he were calling out to the gods, "Serve the teacher of the three worlds!" with great respect. ||15||  The trees on its slopes, with their branches swaying in the wind, and their blossoms smiling, seemed to be dancing in delight. ||16||  The waterfalls cascading down the slopes seemed to be offering water for the feet of the Jina, as if they were eager to serve the great assembly of beings. ||17||  The peaks, adorned with clouds, seemed to be showering the surrounding forests with water, as if they were afraid of fire. ||18||  The sky, held back by the pure white peaks, seemed to be stopping the sun's journey. ||19||  In some places, Kinnaras were enjoying themselves, in others, Nagas were serving, and in others, Khacharas were playing, their beauty unmarred. ||20||  In some places, the mountain was adorned with crystals and opals, their blue hues mixed with the light of the moon, making the gods fear that it was the moon itself. ||21||  In some places, it was adorned with a network of green gems and shining stones, and in others, it was drawing a rainbow in the sky. ||22||  In some places, the edges of the mountain were a beautiful white, mixed with the light of red gems.

The thirtieth chapter, adorned with ruby rays and crystal beams, with a reddish-white complexion, resembling a leper in some places. ||23|| In some places, covered with many layers of broken rocks, bearing the marks of lion's claws, and covered with scabs. ||24|| In some places, echoing with the roar of lions from within the caves, and holding the banks abandoned by intoxicated elephants. ||25|| In some places, adorned with celestial damsels walking on crystal rocks, resembling lightning in the autumn clouds. ||26|| Thus, the Lord of the Earth, surrounded by such wondrous beauty, was filled with joy, seeing the invincible and the lord of the mountains. ||27|| Leaving his vehicle and entourage behind, the Dharma-minded king walked on foot from a distance below the mountain. ||28|| He had no sorrow in his mind while climbing the mountain, for the actions of those who seek the welfare of the soul are not for sorrow. ||29|| He ascended that mountain with divine-crafted, pure, gem-like steps, like the steps of heaven. ||30|| Reaching the upper regions of the mountain, he was greeted by the cool forest winds, as if welcoming a guest. ||31|| He saw forest goddesses, adorned with beautiful flowers, wandering in the fragrant lanes of the Mandara forest. ||32|| He saw deer, lying down in the forest with their young, gently chewing their cud. ||33|| He saw large, coiled, sleeping pythons, gathered together, resembling the intestines of the mountain. ||34|| He saw large, black rocks, fragrant with the musk of elephants, marked with the scratches of their claws. ||35||

Adipurana
Seeing the great glory of the mountain, after climbing a little distance, the purohita said, "This is the right opportunity." ||36||
See, O Dev, the many wonders of this mountain, where even the gods, though residing in heaven, play with disrespect. ||37||
The glory of this mountain, which surpasses all worlds, is sufficient in itself, because the Lord Vrishabhadeva, the Guru of the movable and immovable, resides on it. ||38||
This great mountain, like a lustful man, always bears in its lap, i.e., in its lower middle part, the river-like women, whose blue water-like garments are falling off. ||39||
This lion, though non-violent, is pulling a large serpent from the cave of the mountain for the sake of play only, but being unable to pull it due to its length, he is also releasing it. ||40||
This mountain bears on its banks such forest regions, which seem like the munis, because just as the munis bear all kinds of dualities, i.e., cold, heat, etc., so do these forest regions bear all kinds of dualities, i.e., animals, birds, etc., just as the munis do good to all, so do these forest regions do good to all, and just as the munis remove the suffering, i.e., mental anguish, of the masses, so do these forest regions remove the suffering, i.e., the heat generated by the sun. ||41||
This mountain, with its roaring waterfalls, seems as if it is threatening, i.e., scolding, the lions who have torn the heads of intoxicated elephants with their claws, for fear of sin. ||42||
O Lord, just as you bear, i.e., keep under your control, many kings, who are your companions, i.e., servants, noble, born in a high family, and having excellent bodies, so does this mountain bear, i.e., keep under its control, the wild elephants, who are its companions, i.e., those who walk on its peaks, having a high ridge on their backs, and belonging to a noble race. ||43||
Here, these eight-legged creatures, mistaking the roaring groups of clouds for elephants, jump on them, but then fall down and meet a deplorable fate. ||44||
The branches, whose bark is rubbed off due to the rubbing of the cheeks, and which are wet with the saliva of the elephants, indicate the enjoyment of the forest by the elephants. ||45||
Seeing the lion tearing with its claw-like shoots, understanding the meaning. ||35||
Bharata Maharaja, after climbing a little further, when he started seeing the beauty of the mountain, then the purohita, having got the opportunity, said the following words. ||36||
O Dev, see the many wonder-filled regions of this mountain, where even the gods, though residing in heaven, play with disrespect. ||37||
The glory of this mountain, which surpasses all worlds, is sufficient in itself, because the Lord Vrishabhadeva, the Guru of the movable and immovable, resides on it. ||38||
This great mountain, like a lustful man, always bears in its lap, i.e., in its lower middle part, the river-like women, whose blue water-like garments are falling off. ||39||
This lion, though non-violent, is pulling a large serpent from the cave of the mountain for the sake of play only, but being unable to pull it due to its length, he is also releasing it. ||40||
This mountain bears on its banks such forest regions, which

**46.** See, the monkeys, terrified by the roars of the lion-kings, have become birds and are sitting in the groves out of fear.

**47.** This forest is delightful, filled with the sounds of the teachings of the great sages, and teeming with herds of deer grazing on the tips of the grass.

**48.** Here, the forest is terrifying with the harsh roars of the lions, and there, the elephants are fleeing, having abandoned their food and drink.

**49.** Here are beautiful forest regions where the old buffaloes have dug the edges of the mounds with their horns, and the boars have dug small ponds.

**50.** The deer entering the small ponds and the elephants standing near the bamboo groves clearly indicate that this terrifying forest has been recently attacked by a lion.

**51.** This mountain, always peaceful and fierce, is now peaceful due to the presence of the Lord of the Jinas.

**52.** See, in this forest, the lion-kings are in close proximity with the elephants, and they are freely touching the elephant's wounds made by their claws.

**53.** The deer, along with the lions, tigers, and other ferocious animals, enter the caves, which are inhabited by the wandering monks, without fear, followed by their young ones.

**54.** Oh, what a wonder! Even the animals, who are unaware of the fear and beauty of the forest, are following the great sages.

**55.** This mountain, adorned by the eight-legged creatures, who are known by their appropriate names, will be known as Ashtapadi after your ascent.

**56.** The constellation of stars, approaching the edge of this mountain, where many jewels are shining, is not visible due to the brilliance of those jewels, which are hiding its circle.

**45.** The trees of this forest, which are being polluted by the water of intoxication, clearly indicate the playful activities of the elephants in the forest.

**57.** The trees of this forest, which are being polluted by the water of intoxication, clearly indicate the playful activities of the elephants in the forest.

Even though the group of herbs is ablaze at night, the Kinnara deities do not approach the shores of this mountain made of Indranila gems, fearing darkness. ||50||
The rays emanating from the shores of this mountain, made of green gems, are mistaken for grass sprouts by deer, who approach them, only to be met with great surprise and shame when they find no grass. ||56||
The rows of trees here, filled with the radiance of ruby gems, possess such exquisite beauty as if the reddish glow of twilight is spread over them. ||60||
These Suryakanta gems are ablaze, touched by the rays of the sun, which is only natural, as contact with a luminous object usually nourishes the luminosity of the object in question. ||61||
Even though water flows from the Chandrakant gems on this mountain every night, touched by the rays of the moon, they do not diminish in any way, which is only natural, as the nature of matter is very strange. ||62||
Or, this mountain seems just like the Jina, because just as deities approach the Jina, so too do they approach this mountain. Just as the Jina has accepted the throne, so too has this mountain accepted the throne, i.e., the seats of lions - lions are seated here and there, or, it has accepted lion and Asana trees. Just as the Jina is great, i.e., excellent, so too is this mountain great, i.e., high. And just as the Jina is immovable, i.e., stable in his form, so too is this mountain immovable, i.e., stable. ||63||
O deity, this mountain king Kailasa, whose generous body is pure and clear like pure crystal, is like a pure soul, working for your welfare. ||64||
Thus, when the priest described the excellent beauty of that mountain, King Bharat, who tormented his enemies, attained supreme joy, as if he had become happiness itself. ||65||
The best of the learned, Bharat Chakravarti, had moved forward a little with a happy mind, when he saw the Jina's assembly nearby. ||66||
He knew of the Jina's assembly nearby, due to the shower of flowers falling from above and the sound of the drums. ||67||

The wind, fragrant with the scent of Mandara blossoms, stirred the groves of creepers. It seemed to be approaching, like a purifier, to greet them. || 68 || A shower of flowers fell, filling the sky-like courtyard. The earth was cleansed, along with the cool drops of water. || 69 || The deep sound of the drums echoed in the sky-like courtyard. The peacocks, with their proud necks, heard the thunderous sound. || 70 || With gentle steps, pressed by the weight of a multitude of flowers, the king of kings, tireless, proceeded. || 71 || Reaching the mountain, he saw on its peak the Jain assembly, adorned with the previously described features. || 72 || All the gods and demons gather here, waiting for the auspicious occasion of the divine sound. Thus, the learned have called this assembly, "Samavadhika." || 73 || He approached the Dhulisala, which, with its own radiance, created an unbroken arc like the rainbow. || 74 || He crossed the Dhulisala, which shone with its golden pillars adorned with jeweled arches, and worshipped the Manastambha. || 75 || At the foot of the Manastambha, he saw ponds filled with clear, cool water and adorned with lotuses. These ponds were like the pure and cool teachings of the Jains. || 76 || Within the circumference of the Dhulisala, he saw, in the streets, the earth suitable for the dwelling of the gods. || 77 || Proceeding further, he saw a moat filled with water. It was clear and deep, like the minds of the virtuous. || 78 || Then he saw a grove of creepers, adorned with various kinds of flowers. It was filled with bees, intoxicated by the nectar of the flowers. || 79 ||

Then, going a little ahead, he saw the first kot, which was competing with the shore of the Nishadha mountain and was adorned with the brilliance of jewels. ||80|| He also saw eight auspicious substances placed near the gate of the Gopura, which was guarded by the Devarupa doorkeepers. ||81|| Then, entering inside, the Chakravarti Bharat saw two Natyashalas on either side, and he was filled with great joy, befitting the dance of Indrani. ||82|| He saw two Dhoopghatas, placed on either side of the path, with a group of fragrant fuel, from which very fragrant smoke was emanating. ||83|| In this second enclosure, he saw four forests, which seemed to be offering oblations with their branches, adorned with falling flowers. ||84|| Seeing the forest of blooming Ashoka trees, the forest of Saptaparna trees, the forest of Champaka trees, and the beautiful forest of mangoes, the joy of King Bharat doubled. ||85|| The noble Bharat also worshipped the very tall Chaitya trees in those forests, which were presided over by the Jina images and worshipped by the Indra, Narendra, etc. ||86|| In those forests, the Kinnara women were singing the festival of the Lord, and the Chakravarti Bharat was filled with great satisfaction from their deep-toned songs. ||87|| The Lakshmi of the forest, with the fragrant wind as her fragrant breath and the flowers as her gentle smile, seemed to be conversing with the Chakravarti with the sweet sounds of the cuckoos. ||88|| Those forests, with the sounds of the cuckoo-like drums mixed with the music of the bees, seemed to be proclaiming the victory of the Jina, who had conquered Kamadeva. ||89|| Bharat also heard the great roar, like the roar of the ocean, which was arising from the eagerness of the people of the three worlds to enter there. ||90|| Then, beyond the earth, which was stopped by the forests, he saw the forest altar, like the jeweled belt of a beautiful woman, adorned with jewels. ||91|| Crossing the earth of the main gate of the forest altar, the Chakravarti Bharat saw the earth, which was stopped by the flags, as if it were being stopped by the clothes of the flags, which were being moved by the wind. ||92||

The 32nd chapter: The flag-ground was as beautiful as a sacrificial ground. It was filled with flags, just as the sky of a sacrificial ground is filled with flags. It was adorned with wheels and elephants, just as a sacrificial ground is adorned with wheels and elephants. It was filled with the cries of "Victory to the Jina King!", just as a sacrificial ground is filled with the cries of "Victory to the Jina King!". 13
The flags were of ten types: lion, cloth, lotus, peacock, elephant, Garuda, garland, bull, swan, and wheel. 14
There were 108 flags of each type in each direction. The Chakravartin King, after worshipping them, moved on. 15
He then saw a second walled city, with four gates, made of silver. He passed through it and saw a theatre and other things, just as before. 16
He saw the dancing of the celestial women, heard their songs, and smelled the fragrance of incense. His senses were filled with delight. 17
He then saw a forest of Kalpa trees in the middle of the same enclosure. These trees were adorned with garlands, clothes, and ornaments, and they granted all desires. 18
He circumambulated the Siddhartha trees, which were adorned with images of the Siddhas and worshipped by the Indras. He bowed to them and worshipped them. 19
He then passed through a forest altar, adorned with four gates, and saw a land filled with palaces and stupas. 20
The palaces were of various types, built for the dwelling of the gods. They had three, four, five, and more floors, and were adorned with various ornaments. 21
The stupas were made of jewels, and were adorned with jewel arches. They were filled with images of the Jina, and were very beautiful. 22
He saw these stupas, worshipped them, and praised them. He was filled with wonder, and passed through the enclosure. 23

He saw the third enclosure made of crystal, which appeared as if it had attained purity due to the proximity of the Jina. ||104|| There, he was respectfully permitted by the great doorkeepers, the Kalpa-dwelling gods, and entered the assembly of the Lord. ||105|| He saw the glorious pavilion, extending a yojana in all directions, encompassing the entire universe, and containing the universe within itself. ||106|| There, he saw the wise Munis, the Kalpa-born goddesses, the Aryikas, the queens, the astrologers, the Vyantara and Bhavan-dwelling goddesses, the Bhavan, Vyantara, and Kalpa-dwelling gods, the kings, and the animals, all twelve groups, their eyes filled with joy from seeing the Lord's feet. ||107-109|| Seeing these, the great king, taking refuge in the first section of the three-tiered platform, circumambulated it. ||109|| There, the Chakravarti, with joy, worshipped the four Dharmachakras in all directions, which were held on the heads of the Yaksha kings and imitated the disc of the sun. ||110|| In the second section, he worshipped the eight great banners, marked with the symbols of the wheel, elephant, bull, lotus, lion, garland, cloth, and Garuda. ||111|| Then, the wise Chakravarti saw the world-teacher, Lord Rishabhadeva, in the third section, where the beautiful fragrant hut was situated. ||112|| Within that fragrant hut, he saw the Lord seated on a throne made of jewels, very beautiful and as high as the peak of Mount Meru, with a large body, shaded by three umbrellas, yet himself without shadow, destroying sins, whose halo encompassed the groups of humans, gods, and demigods, who appeared as if he was revealing his power to dispel the sorrow of those who took refuge in his feet, whose surroundings were filled with waving fly whisks, who had a beautiful body, and therefore, who was like Mount Sumeru...

Surrounded by a radiant halo, it appeared as if the sun's disc was being imitated by the circular halo. 117
Its rising was announced by the resounding thunder of the celestial drums, and its glory was enhanced by divine clouds showering flowers. 118
Its deep roar, reverberating throughout the three worlds, filled all beings with joy, and it resembled a rain-bearing cloud, showering the water of Dharma. 119
It effortlessly spread a divine language, though it was one in essence, yet multi-faceted, dispelling the darkness of the hearts of men. 120
Possessing immeasurable strength, it was exceedingly beautiful even without ornaments, adorned with the splendor of eloquence, fragrant with virtue, and marked by auspicious signs. 121
It was free from sweat and dirt, cast no shadow, and its eyelids never blinked, making it beautiful. It had a perfectly symmetrical form, and its body was imbued with strength, making it impenetrable. 122
Seeing the Jina, the embodiment of such inconceivable greatness, from afar, King Bharata was filled with joy and bowed down, touching his knees to the ground. 123
His crown swayed slightly as he bowed from afar, and his jeweled earrings danced, making him appear as if he were offering an offering of jewels to the Jina. 124
Then, with the desire to attain the fruit of liberation, he performed the prescribed rituals of worship, offering water, sandalwood paste, garlands of flowers, grains of rice, offerings of food, lamps, incense, and fruits. 125
Having completed the rituals of worship, King Bharata bowed down to the Supreme Lord, Rishabhadeva, and began to praise him with beautiful hymns. 126
O Lord, you are the Supreme Soul, the possessor of infinite virtues, the imperishable one. Though I am weak and powerless, I am compelled by your power to praise you with great devotion. 127

**Where are your infinite qualities, O Lord, and where am I, a mere insignificant being, who cannot even comprehend the qualities of the Ganadharas? Yet, inspired by devotion to your qualities, I strive to praise you.** ||128|| **O Lord, even a little devotion to you bears immense fruit. This is only natural, for the wealth of the master nourishes the lineage of the servants.** ||129|| **Just as the rays of the sun emerge from behind the clouds, so too, your countless qualities have manifested after the removal of the obscuring veil of karmic impurities.** ||130|| **O Lord, by conquering karmic impurities, your true vision, knowledge, happiness, and strength, which are all impermanent, have become manifest.** ||131|| **O Lord, when your supreme light of Kevala Jnana (omniscience) emerged, you instantly knew all the worlds and non-worlds without any limitations.** ||132|| **O Lord, your words, which are all-pervading and pure, reveal your omniscience.

Syad Avaktvyam Evam (It may be that it is inexpressible), 5. Syad Asti Cha Avaktvyam Cha (It may be that it exists and is inexpressible), 6.

**O Dev, in those who are deluded by a web of words that are contradictory and unconnected to reality, and who are unworthy of faith, omniscience resides in you.**

**Explanation:** Only one who speaks without contradiction can be omniscient. The words of other gods in the world contradict each other, revealing their deluded minds. Therefore, we cannot believe that they are omniscient. However, your words, your teachings, are free from contradiction. You have described all the aspects of reality. This shows that your intellect and knowledge are infallible, and therefore you are omniscient.

**Just as the sun, hidden in the embrace of the clouds, is revealed by the blooming lotuses, so too are you revealed by the power of your words.**

**Each object exists only in relation to its own fourfold nature (substance, space, time, and mode), but does not exist in relation to the fourfold nature of others. It is also inexpressible because both these aspects cannot be asserted together. Thus, each object primarily possesses three aspects: existence, non-existence, and inexpressibility. These primary aspects, in combination, give rise to seven aspects each. For example, "The living being exists." Here, the living being and existence are in a relation of qualifier and qualified. The qualifier resides only in the qualified, so the existence of the living being is only in the living being, not elsewhere. Similarly, "The living being does not exist." Here too, the living being and non-existence are in a relation of qualifier and qualified. Therefore, according to the above rule, non-existence is only in the living being, not elsewhere. These aspects of existence and non-existence of the living being cannot be asserted together, so there is also an aspect called inexpressibility. When we intend to express only the aspect of existence of the living being, then the first assertion is "Perhaps the living being exists." When we intend to express the aspect of non-existence, then the second assertion is "The living being does not exist." When we intend to express both aspects in sequence, then the third assertion is "Perhaps the living being exists and does not exist." When we intend to express both aspects simultaneously, then the fourth assertion is "Perhaps it is inexpressible," because two contradictory aspects cannot be asserted at the same time. When we intend to express the aspects of existence and inexpressibility, then the fifth assertion is "Perhaps the living being exists and is inexpressible." When we intend to express the aspects of non-existence and inexpressibility, then the sixth assertion is "Perhaps the living being does not exist and is inexpressible." And when we intend to express the aspects of existence, non-existence, and inexpressibility, then the seventh assertion is "Perhaps the living being exists, does not exist, and is inexpressible." In relation to combination, each object possesses each aspect in seven forms of assertion. Therefore, to express them, the Jina Bhagavan taught through the seven-fold assertion (a group of seven assertions). When the aspect of existence of the living being is being described, the absence of its remaining aspects should not be understood. Therefore, the word "perhaps" is used to indicate intention, and words like "indeed" and "certainly" are used to remove doubt. Thus, the sentence "Perhaps the living being exists indeed" means that the living being exists in some relation. The meaning of other sentences should be understood in the same way. Jainism, with its comprehensive vision, asserts all the aspects within an object according to intention. Therefore, it is called the doctrine of Syadvada. In fact, without this all-encompassing vision, the complete nature of an object cannot be expressed.**

**140.** May your vast spiritual knowledge remain hidden, O Lord! It is your external splendor that teaches us about your role as a teacher.

**141.** Your magnificent lion throne, crafted by divine artisans and adorned with glittering jewels, shines like the peak of Mount Meru.

**142.** This trio of radiant umbrellas, held aloft by the gods, is a symbol of your dominion over the three worlds. How can we not believe it?

**143.** These divine fly whisks, waved by the gods, proclaim your extraordinary power, surpassing the limits of the universe.

**144.** Divine clouds shower fragrant flowers upon your assembly, attracting swarms of bees.

**145.** Divine drums, struck by the hands of celestial attendants, resound with a deep, resonant sound in the celestial courtyard, celebrating your victory.

**146.** This Ashoka tree, whose proximity is graced by the gods and which dispels the sorrow and suffering of the people, seems to emulate you, for your presence is also graced by the gods, and you too alleviate the sorrow and suffering of the people.

This eightfold **Vibhuti** (splendor) is yours, O Lord, and it reveals your extraordinary glory. || 149 ||

Your **Gandhakuți** (fragrant chamber), as high as Mount Meru, stands on a three-tiered pedestal, shining like the peak of Meru. || 150 ||

This **Gandhakuți** resounds with the hymns of the great **Munis** (saints) who praise you, as if it itself yearns to sing your praises with devotion. || 151 ||

The **Nākabhājas** (celestial beings) who dwell in this **Gandhakuți**, adorned with the finest jewels and radiating brilliance, serve you with humility and devotion. || 152 ||

The crowns of these humble celestial beings, adorned with jewels, shine like lamps placed near your feet. || 153 ||

The rays of your toenails, falling on the heads of countless bowing celestial beings, illuminate them as if they were touched by your grace. || 154 ||

The faces of the celestial women, reflecting in your nail-like mirrors, are adorned with the beauty of your lotus-like feet. || 155 ||

The saffron-like radiance of your feet spreads across the faces of the celestial beings, giving them a radiant glow. || 156 ||

Your three-tiered pedestal, situated in the center of the earth, is adorned with countless auspicious objects. || 157 ||

The first perimeter of this pedestal is adorned with **Dharmachakras** (wheels of law), and the second perimeter is adorned with your magnificent flags waving in all eight directions. || 158 ||

Three walls adorned with four lofty gateways, a collection of auspicious substances, treasures, and toranas. Two bright natyashalas, two beautiful incense burners, a perimeter of forest rows adorned with chaitya trees. Two forest vedis, the earth filled with rows of tall flags, an expanse of kalpavriksha forests, a row of stupas and houses. Thus, your assembly ground, purifying humans, gods, and the earth, seems as if a collection of the best things from all three worlds has been gathered in one place. [160-164]
O Jinendra, your extraordinary external splendor, which reveals your great prosperity or wealth, clearly manifests your inner Lakshmi. [165]
O Nath, this assembly ground, created by the gods, which cannot be debated, does not destroy your extraordinary detachment. Meaning: Seeing the unparalleled splendor of the assembly ground, your heart does not experience any attachment. [166]
Thus, you, whose extraordinary glory is unparalleled, who are the lord of the three worlds, and whose rule is supremely pure, purify me, who is standing before you through praise. [167]
O Bhagavan, it is pointless to elaborate on your praise, for your qualities are utterly inconceivable. Therefore, I praise you briefly, saying, "O Ishana, victory to you, and salutations to you." [168]
O Ish, victory to you, O burner of the fuel of karma, victory to you, O free from decay, victory to you, O guru of the worlds, victory to you, O benefactor of all, victory to you, and O victorious, victory to you. [169]

The great sins I had accumulated due to being deluded by the delusion of conquest, were destroyed by merely seeing you, just as the darkness of night is destroyed by the rising sun. (194)

If mere remembrance of your feet purifies a person, then how much more so will the praise of your qualities, offered with devotion, purify him? (195)

O Lord, whatever merit I have earned by praising your qualities, I desire that it may always be dedicated to your lotus feet. (196)

Thus, the emperor Bharat, with his mind illuminated, bowed down with devotion to the supreme Lord, the teacher of the movable and immovable, the first of the Tirthankaras, whose face was bathed in tears of joy, and whose head was adorned with the dust of his own hands. (197)

Having heard the ancient Dharma from the ancient Purusha, the Lord, and having attained pure knowledge by conquering the cycle of karma, the emperor Bharat was filled with great joy. It is natural for wise men to find satisfaction in doing what is beneficial to them. (198)

Then, the emperor Bharat, the lord of treasures, whose head was adorned with a crown that touched the feet of the Lord, inquired from his father, the first teacher, and bowed down with his head to the other monks present there. He was eager to return to his abode, Ayodhya. (199)

The emperor Bharat, with a mind filled with joy, and seeing his beautiful garland, which was offered with devotion to the feet of the Jina, as a symbol of the remaining Akshatas, with great difficulty, removed his gaze from the assembly hall of the Jina and departed. (200)

**Verse 201:**

Gazing upon the resplendent glory of the Jinas, with eyes wide open and arms long as an era, Bharat, the banner of the Manu dynasty, returned to his abode, followed by the kings of the earth, bowing their heads in reverence.

**Verse 202:**

From the very dawn of his meritorious deeds, the Chakravarti conquered all directions, a feat that took sixty thousand years.  Then, with joy, he bowed to the Jina and attained supreme bliss.  Therefore, O wise ones, strive to accumulate merit.

**Chapter 33:**

Thus ends the thirty-third chapter of the *Trishatilakṣaṇamahāpurāṇa*, composed by the venerable Jinasena Acharya, known as the *Bharatarāja Kailāsa Abhigamana Varṇanam* (The Account of Bharat's Journey to Mount Kailasa). 

Page #169:
---------------------------
The thirty-fourth chapter: Having descended from Mount Kailasa, like Indra from Mount Meru, the wise Chakravarti set out for Ayodhya. ||1|| Accompanied by his army, the Chakravarti shone as he journeyed towards his home, like the unstoppable flow of the Ganga, along with a multitude of rivers, towards the ocean. ||2|| After traveling for some time, the Chakravarti's army, adorned with arches and flying banners, reached the vicinity of Ayodhya. ||3|| The city, whose earth was sprinkled with fragrant sandalwood paste, was adorned as if it had bathed and applied sandalwood paste upon the arrival of its lord. ||4|| As the lord entered the city, his Chakra-ratna, which had destroyed all enemies, could not pass through the city gate and remained outside. ||5|| The city, illuminated by the rays of the Chakra-ratna stationed near the gate, appeared as if it had donned the glow of twilight, its radiance resembling saffron. ||6|| The city, with the Chakra-ratna blazing in front of it, seemed as if it were proclaiming the truth that the king of Ayodhya was indeed the foremost among all Chakravartis, and to prove this, he had donned the blazing sun-disk. ||7|| Then, many gods, protectors of the Chakra-ratna, were astonished upon seeing the Chakra-ratna standing still. ||8|| Some of the gods, filled with anger, cried out, "What is this? What is this?" and brandishing swords, they whirled around like a blazing Chakra. ||9|| Others, bewildered, wondered, "Has the sun's disk fallen from the sky? Or has another sun risen?" ||10||

The enemy, like an untimely cycle, must fall. The wheel, like a planet, has been deflected by someone's hand. ||11|| Or perhaps there is still a side to be conquered by the Chakravarti. Some knowledgeable people have reasoned thus from the wheel's skidding. ||12|| The generals and other leaders informed the Chakravarti of this. Hearing the news, he was somewhat surprised. ||13|| He pondered, "Why is this wheel, which never stops, skidding today, even though I am here? Its movement never falters." ||14|| "This must be considered," he said, summoning the priest. The valiant king spoke these words in a loud voice. ||15|| From the lotus-like mouth of the king, Saraswati, with her clear intentions and adorned with beautiful ornaments, emerged like a victorious goddess. ||16|| This wheel, which has attacked all directions, which is terrifying to the enemy, why is it not advancing into my city gate? ||17|| In conquering all directions, it did not stop in the eastern, southern, or western seas, nor in the two caves of victory. Why is this wheel now skidding in my courtyard? There must be someone who desires to oppose me. ||18-19|| Is there an insurmountable enemy in my realm, or is there someone of my lineage, with a wicked heart, who hates me? ||20|| Perhaps some wicked person hates me without reason and does not welcome me. The hearts of wicked people often turn against even great men. ||21|| The hearts of great men are free from envy when others prosper, but the hearts of petty men are filled with envy when others prosper. ||22|| Or perhaps someone, filled with arrogance, has not bowed down to me. His pride has surely caused the wheel to be deflected. ||23||

**24.**  Indeed, even the smallest enemy should not be neglected.  A small enemy, like a speck of dust in the eye, is capable of causing great pain if ignored.

**25.**  Even a small thorn, if not removed forcefully, can cause great pain when lodged in the foot.

**26.**  This Chakra, a divine gem, is the most precious of all gems. Its movement cannot be disrupted without a cause.

**27.**  Therefore, O noble one, the task indicated by this Chakra is not insignificant.  It is a vital part of the kingdom, and even a minor cause cannot cause its disruption.

**28.**  Therefore, O wise minister, carefully consider the reason for this Chakra's stillness.  Unconsidered actions bear no fruit in this world or the next.

**29.**  This knowledge of the task rests in your divine vision.  Who else can dispel darkness except the sun?

**30.**  Having conveyed this task to the diviner with concise words, the king remained silent.  Indeed, noble ones are usually of few words.

**31.**  Then, the diviner, with a pleasant and profound voice, adorned with beautiful words, spoke to King Bharata.

**32.**  The sweetness, the power, the elegance of your words, and the clarity of your meaning – where else can these be found?  Nowhere else.

**33.**  We are merely scholars of the scriptures, not experts in the art of action.  But who else, in the field of statecraft, can match your knowledge of applying the scriptures?  No one.

**34.**  You are the foremost king, a king-sage, and this knowledge of statecraft originated with you.  How can we, who know this knowledge, not follow your lead?

Adipuranam, although the respect you have shown us is unparalleled, it is enhancing our prestige in the world, therefore I am ready to speak. ||35||
O Dev, we have heard from the knowers of destiny that the Chakra Ratna (the wheel of the emperor) does not rest as long as there is something left to conquer, meaning it never stops against the will of the Chakravarti. ||36||
Your victorious weapon, which is as terrifying as blazing flames, is stuck at the city gate, as if it is being held back. ||37||
O Dev, while you rule your people, the words enemy, friend, enemy's friend, and friend's friend have only remained in scriptures, meaning in reality, you have neither a friend nor an enemy, everyone is your servant. ||38||
However, there is still someone who needs to be conquered, and he has manifested within your own home, like a terrible disease in the stomach. ||39||
You have conquered the outer circle, but the purification of the inner circle has not yet happened. Meaning, although you have conquered those outside, your own people are not yet aligned with you. ||40||
Although you have conquered all the enemy factions, your brothers are not humble towards you, they have not bowed to you. They stand against you, and being of the same lineage, they cannot be harmed by you. ||41||
Even a powerful and brilliant man is hindered by his own people, this is evident in the example of the Suryakant gem burning in front of the sun. ||42||
Even a weak person of the same lineage, by gaining the support of a powerful person, can destroy the king, just as a weak stick, by gaining the support of a sharp axe, can destroy its own kind, like trees. ||43||
These brothers of yours are invincible, powerful, and proud, and among them, the youngest, the wise, the brave, the strong, and the powerful Bahubali is the most prominent. ||44||
These ninety-nine brothers of yours are very powerful, we bow to no one except Lord Adinath. ||45||

**46.** O Chakradhara, you must act swiftly in this matter. A wise person does not neglect even a small amount of debt, wound, fire, or enemy.

**47.** O King, let this earth be ruled by you alone, let it not become Rajavati, ruled by many kings, due to your brothers, leading to a state of instability with multiple rulers. 

**48.** O Lord, while you are the king, the word "king" does not adorn any other place. How can a deer claim the title of "Mrigaendra" (King of the Deer) when a lion is present?

**49.** O Lord, let your brothers, free from envy, follow your lead. It is the scriptural injunction that the elder, the chief of this time, should be followed.

**50.** Having gone and spoken to them with tact, make them obey your orders. If they do not obey, then engage in conflict and speak to them differently.

**51.** If anyone, filled with false pride, does not submit to you, then it is unfortunate that he will destroy himself and his kingdom.

**52.** What is the point of saying more? Either they should come and bow to you, or they should seek refuge in the Jina, the savior of the world.

**53.** There is no third path for them, these are the only two options: either they enter your camp, or they enter the forest with the deer.

**54.** Their own families, like burning embers, will be consumed by their disobedience. Those who follow you will experience ultimate joy.

**55.** They have decided that they will not bow to anyone.

Thus, the learned and wise Purohita spoke. Chakravarti Bharat, accepting his words, was filled with anger at that moment. ||57||

He cast his vision, clouded by anger, like a sacrifice to the directions, raising his brows like the smoky flame of anger. ||58||

He spoke harsh words, deceiving with his words, like the venom of a snake, born from the anger of a brother. ||59||

"What did you say, Purohita? What did you say? These wicked brothers do not bow to me. Let them see the destruction of my fierce, fiery meteor, shattering them into pieces." ||60||

"This act of theirs has never been seen, nor heard of. Their enmity is without cause. They think that because we are born in the same lineage, we are unworthy of respect." ||61||

"They are afflicted by the fierce wind of youth, born from their pride as warriors. The sweat caused by the heat of the burning wheel is their only remedy." ||62||

"They desire to enjoy the earth given by our revered father without paying taxes. What good is their warrior pride? Let them either proclaim that Bharat is the enjoyer of this earth, and we are all subject to him, or let them, lying on the battlefield, their bodies pierced by the sharp thorns of weapons, enjoy the earth by falling upon another bed, the bed of war. In other words, they cannot enjoy this earth while they are alive." ||63-64||

"Where am I, who has conquered all those worthy of conquest, and where are they, who are worthy of enjoying my domain? Nevertheless, let them have their share, following my command." ||65||

Chapter Thirty-Four

I cannot give them this earth for their enjoyment in any other way. How can this wheel-jewel rest without conquering them? ||66|| It is a great reproach that the one who is extremely intelligent, loves his brothers, and is efficient, is also becoming attached to vices. ||67|| What is the use of all the other princes bowing down except the mighty one? And what is the use of enjoying this city without Podanpur, which is like poison? ||68|| What is the use of servants who are capable of repelling enemies with terrible weapons, when the mighty one, who is shining with new valor, is not under our control? ||69|| Or, what is the use of my warrior brothers, who are embodiments of great valor, when the arrogant mighty one is behaving so inappropriately towards me? ||70|| Thus, when the Chakravarti began to speak very harshly in anger, the priest calmed him down and, in order to begin the work in a proper way, he made the following efforts. ||71|| O Lord, why are you conquered by the force of anger, even though you have declared that you have conquered all those who are worthy of being conquered? The one who has conquered his senses should be conquered by the force of anger first. ||72|| They are your brothers, children, so they can play according to their childish nature even on the wrong path. But this darkness is not fit to stay in you, who has conquered the six internal enemies: lust, anger, greed, delusion, pride, and jealousy. That is, you should not be angry. ||73|| The person who is immersed in the dense darkness of anger and does not liberate his soul is not capable of crossing over the duality of doubt about action. Meaning: There is always doubt about the success of action due to anger. ||74|| How can a king who is not capable of conquering the enemies born from his own inner being know what is right and wrong, when he does not know his own soul? ||75|| Therefore, O Lord, stay away from this anger, which harms. Those who desire victory conquer themselves, for they conquer me with forgiveness. ||76|| 

Page #176:

Adipurana
For those who have conquered their senses, who have heard the scriptures well, and who desire to conquer the other world, forgiveness is the best means. ||77||
In this task, which can be accomplished by writing, excessive effort is futile, for who would use an axe to cut the sprout of a blade of grass? ||78||
Therefore, you should subdue your brothers by remaining patient and sending them gifts and messengers. ||79||
You should send messengers with letters today, telling them to come and serve their elder brother. ||80||
Their service will be like the service of a wish-fulfilling tree, fulfilling all your desires. Your elder brother is like a father, a chakravarti, and worthy of your worship in every way. ||81||
Just as the moon's orb is not adorned by distant stars, so too, your wealth is not adorned by you who are far away. ||82||
This kingdom will not be a source of satisfaction for them without you, for a kingdom shared with brothers is a source of joy for the virtuous. ||83||
This is a verbal message, the rest you should understand from the letter. Thus, you should assure those valiant brothers with gifts and letters. ||84||
O Arya, this is the work that will bring you fame and prosperity. If they do not submit peacefully, then you should consider what to do next. ||85||
You should do this work, fearing the censure of the people, for fame is permanent in the world, while wealth is perishable. ||86||
Thus, the chakravarti abandoned his angry nature at the words of the priest. It is true that the minds of great men can be swayed by kind words. ||87||
Let the mighty one who cannot be subdued by effort remain for now. I will test the cunning of the rest of the brothers. ||88||

Thus, the Cakravartin, whose intellect is never deluded in the matter of work, sent forth the messengers, whose purpose was fulfilled, to his brothers. || 89 || Having gone there as directed, they saw them and, as was proper, delivered the message of the king to them. || 90 || Then, after the report of their mission was completed, those brothers, who were hardened by the pride of their acquired power, said to the messengers: || 91 || "What the Adiraja, Bharata, has said is true and acceptable to us, for in the absence of a father, the elder brother is worthy of worship by the younger brothers. || 92 || But our father, who sees all the worlds, is present before us. He is our authority, and this power of ours is his gift. || 93 || Therefore, in this matter, we are subject to the command of our father's feet, and we are not independent. We have nothing to take or give from or to Bharatesvara. || 94 || And the invitation that he has given us for the purpose of division, that is, the summons, has made us very happy and satisfied. || 95 || Thus, having honored the messengers with due respect, like kings, and having given them gifts and letters in return, those princes immediately sent them away. || 96 || Having honored the messengers and given a suitable reply to Bharata, those princes, who were devoted to their father, went to him to deliver the task entrusted to them by him. || 97 || Having gone there, they saw their father, who was adorned with appropriate ornaments, like the great mountain, the abode of the peak of Kailasa. || 98 || Having prostrated themselves before him in accordance with the rules and having worshipped him as was proper, those princes declared to the Lord, the destroyer of Kamadeva: || 99 || "We have been born of you, and we have obtained this supreme prosperity from you. We desire your favor, and we worship none other than you. || 100 ||

They only say, "It is the Guru's grace." We, however, who have attained prosperity through your grace, have experienced the essence of that statement. ||101||

We, who are devoted to your name, who desire your grace, and who are your servants, do not desire the worship of anyone else. ||102||

In this situation, Bharata calls us to pay our respects. We do not know if his motivation is pride or envy. ||103||

O Dev, our heads, intoxicated by the pleasure of practicing prostration to you, will never find satisfaction in prostrating to anyone else. ||104||

Does the royal swan, after being served by the pollen-stained water of Manasa Sarovar, seek the service of the water of any other lake? ||105||

Does the bee, satisfied by the fragrance of the flowers adorning the hair of Apsaras, go to the forest of bees even after death? ||106||

Or, does the Chatak, having drunk the pure sky-born water, like pearls falling from a fresh cloud, desire to drink the water of a drying lake when thirsty? ||107||

Thus, our heads, stained with the pollen of your lotus feet, are not capable of paying respects to anyone else, neither in this world nor in the next. ||108||

We have come to your side to receive the initiation of a warrior, which is free from the fear of prostrating to others and is devoid of fear. ||109||

Therefore, O Dev, tell us the path that is beneficial and conducive to our well-being, so that our devotion to you becomes firm in this world and the next. ||110||

O Dev, may we attain your position, which is free from the fear of humiliation arising from prostrating to others, in every birth. ||111||

Yogis, free from the fear of humiliation arising from the destruction of pride, find happiness in the forests, equal to the Hari. ||112||

They want to... ||100||

In this world, people say, "It is the father's grace," but we, who have attained great wealth through your grace, have experienced the essence of that statement. ||101||

We, who are devoted to your name, who desire your grace, and who are your servants, do not desire the worship of anyone else. ||102||

Even so, Bharata calls us to pay our respects. We do not know if his motivation is pride or envy. ||103||

O Dev, our heads, intoxicated by the pleasure of practicing prostration to you, will never find satisfaction in prostrating to anyone else. ||104||

Saying this, the preacher, establishing them in the eternal, said to them, "O Bhagavan," and thus instructed them. ||113||
You, who are great men, with the best of bodies, full of youth, strength, and virtues, how can you be the carriers of others, like good elephants? ||114||
What is there in this kingdom, in this life, in this fleeting existence? What is there in this madness of youth, corrupted by wealth and power? ||115||
What is the use of armies that can be conquered by the strong? What is the use of gold, silver, elephants, horses, and other things that can be stolen? And what is the use of this wealth, which is like fuel for the fire of greed? ||116||
Those things which do not bring satisfaction even after being enjoyed for a long time, but only bring fatigue, are like poisoned food, and it is useless to enjoy them. ||117||
O sons, is there any object whose taste you have not experienced? The same taste of all these objects, which you have experienced many times, how can it satisfy you? ||118||
Where weapons become friends, sons and brothers become enemies, and the earth itself becomes a woman for everyone to enjoy, such a kingdom is to be condemned. ||119||
Let the best of kings, Bharata, rule this land of Bharata, as long as the rise of merit lasts, it is useless for you to be angry. ||120||
Even this kingdom, which is perishable, will be abandoned by Bharata, so why do you fight for this unstable kingdom? ||121||
Therefore, it is useless to be envious, you should embrace the great tree of Dharma, whose flower of compassion never fades and which bears the great fruit of liberation. ||122||
That which is free from the humility born of the worship of others, but which is itself worshipped by others, that is the austerity which protects your great pride. ||123||
Initiation is the protector, virtues are the servants, and compassion is the beloved wife. This is the kingdom of austerity, which is the best and which is beyond description. ||124||

Having heard the supreme words of the Lord, those who had come, having embraced the great renunciation, departed from their homes to the forest. ||125|| Having received the initiation given by the Lord Vrishabhadeva, like a new bride, they, the young kings, were like new grooms. ||126|| They embraced that initiation, which, like a wife, came close with great affection, holding the hair (kachagraha). ||127|| Having embraced intense austerity, those great sages shone like the sun in summer, their brilliance eclipsing the world. ||128|| Through intense austerities, they attained a thin body, which, adorned with the qualities of austerity, shone like a sculpture carved by the goddess of austerity. ||129|| Standing in the Samayika vow, distinguished by the Jina-kalpa, they practiced intense austerity, enhanced by purity of knowledge. ||130|| Having attained the pinnacle of detachment, those lords of the age, free from their own nature, were not desirous of the wealth of the kingdom. ||131|| Embraced by the goddess of austerity, they were eager for the wealth of liberation, and, engrossed in the wealth of knowledge, they forgot the wealth of the kingdom. ||132|| Having studied the twelve-limbed Shruta-skandha, those great intellects adorned their souls with the excellent practice of austerity. ||133|| Understanding that the control of the mind comes from study, and the control of the senses from the control of the mind, those wise ones devoted their intellect to study. ||134|| Through the Acharaanga, they understood the perfect conduct, free from any transgression of the purity of conduct. ||135||
The kingdom of austerity is the best kingdom, whose every element is praiseworthy. ||124||

Knowing all the Sutrakṛtāṅga, the Sūtas became the maintainer of the Dharma-kriyā-samādhana. || 136 ||
Having entered deeply into the third Anga, called the Sthānā-adhyayana, which is as deep as the ocean, with hundreds of chapters, they quickly understood the difference of the jewels of truth. || 137 ||
Having studied the fourth Anga, called Samvāya, those with good intellect, understood the group of dravya, etc., correctly. || 138 ||
Having studied the fifth Anga, called Vyākhyā-prajñapti, those wise and brave princes understood various questions and answers. || 139 ||
Knowing the Dharma-kathā, the sixth Anga, and understanding it well, they explained the Dharma-kathā, as spoken by the great sage, to the ignorant without any error. || 140 ||
Having studied the seventh Anga, called Upāsaka-adhyayana, which is very excellent, they taught the entire Śrāvaka-ācāra to the listeners. || 141 ||
From the eighth Anga, called Anta-kṛt-daśa, they knew the story of the ten Anta-kṛt Munis who conquered unbearable afflictions in the Tirtha of each Tirthankara and became liberated. || 142 ||
Those princes, who were the best among the knowers, knew the story of the ten Munis who conquered unbearable afflictions in the Tirtha of each Tirthankara and were born in the Anuttara-vimāna, from the ninth Anga, called Anuttara-vimāna-upapādaka. || 143 ||
Those Munis, with steady minds, explained the attainment of happiness, sorrow, etc., of beings, by understanding the questions from the tenth Anga, called Praśna-vyākaranā. || 144 ||
Knowing the entire nature of good and bad karma from the eleventh Anga, called Vipāka-sūtra, those Munis, without any laziness, performed intense austerities to destroy karma. || 145 ||
Knowing all the differences of vision from the twelfth Anga, called Dṛṣṭi-vāda, those princes, attaining supreme emotion, became devoted to the Jain scriptures. || 146 ||
Within that twelfth Anga, those Munis, who had determined the secret of all Śruta-knowledge, studied the fourteen places of the fourteen Mahā-vidyās, in order. || 147 ||

The Adipurana then describes those who have heard all the scriptures and whose eyes are the scriptures themselves. These monks, through the excellence of their contemplation of the scriptures, attained purity in their austerities.  

These monks, who were constantly silent with me, engaged in conversation with the goddess of speech, and thus the practice of austerity caused them great suffering.  

These wise monks, enduring unbearable bodily pain, practiced both internal and external austerities for a long time.  

In the summer, they ascended the peaks of mountains and endured the unbearable heat of the sun's rays, thus attaining the state of sun-worship.  

They stood with their feet on the heated rocks of the mountain peaks, their arms hanging down.  

The earth was covered with hot dust, the forests were consumed by fire, the water bodies were dried up, and the directions were filled with smoke and darkness.  In this extremely harsh summer, with the forests of the mountains consumed by fire, these monks stood firm, enduring the intense heat.  

When the clouds covered all the directions, making them dark, these yogis spent their nights under the trees.  

When the clouds poured down water in thick streams like pestles, these great sages spent those rainy nights without any disturbance.  

These powerful monks, dwelling within the womb of meditation and covered with the cloak of fortitude, endured the days covered with dense clouds.  

In the winter, these monks, lying down in the open sky, endured their bodies, which were greatly afflicted by the heavy snow, remaining motionless like wood.  

These monks, naked and without fire, remained always free from duality, their bodies fortified by fortitude, enduring the cold winds.

**165**  They, the steadfast ones, with their bodies covered by the cold, endured the icy winds, as if their limbs were clothed. **166**  These steadfast ones, embracing the difficult three-time yoga, sustained it for a long time through their fortitude. **167**  They, bearing the intensely radiant and difficult-to-attain tapas within, appeared like waves with their bodies, as if imitating the ocean. **168**  These wise ones, considering the enjoyed and abandoned pleasures as meaningless like a garland without fragrance, did not desire them again. **169**  Considering the life of beings as fleeting like foam, dew, or evening clouds, they firmly attached themselves to the eternal path. **170**  Disenchanted with the abode of samsara and freed from the dwelling of homes, they attained supreme joy in the path of the Jinas, the cause of liberation. **171**  With the firm conviction that there is no other higher teaching, these royal sages, with their mind, speech, and body, believed in the teachings of the Guru. **172**  Devoted to the eternal Dharma, as spoken by the Jinas, these seekers of liberation, bound by the shackles of karma, stood up for liberation. **173**  Filled with faith born from fervor, they contemplated the great vows, which are difficult to attain, on the supreme, pure path. **174**  They contemplated the six great vows: non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy, non-possession, and non-eating after sunset. **175**  These steadfast ones, with their vows firmly established for life, attained supreme purity, having renounced all the faults through the three-fold repentance. **176**  Free from all beginnings, pure, without possessions, and having renounced attachment to their bodies, they worshipped the path.

## The Adipurana

The princes, following the path of liberation as taught by the Jina, renounced all possessions, both external and internal, as described by the Jina. They did not desire even a speck of attachment. (12)

These great souls, free from attachment to their own bodies, were firmly established in the path of Dharma. They had conquered their desires through the practice of contentment. (173)

These homeless ascetics, who practiced the vow of non-possession with utmost excellence, would stay in a single place wherever the sun set. (174)

These royal sages preferred to dwell in secluded and pure places. They would stay in villages for a single day and in cities for no more than five days. (175)

Free from the seven fears, these ascetics resided in empty houses, cremation grounds, and other secluded places with great courage. (176)

These powerful princes considered it good to dwell in caves and forests filled with lions and other harmful creatures. (177)

They resided in the midst of the terrifying wilderness, filled with the roars of lions, bears, wolves, tigers, leopards, and other beasts. (178)

These fearless ascetics lived on the edges of mountains, echoing with the roars of tigers spreading in all directions. (179)

These ascetics, fearless in the forest, were filled with the sound of the harsh roars of lion cubs. (180)

They resided in vast cremation grounds, where groups of Dakinis danced near headless bodies, where the forest echoed with the loud cries of owls, and where all directions were filled with the ominous sounds of jackals. (181-182)

167. Like lions, those Nrisimhas resided in the caves of the mountains, following the teachings of the Jina, with their minds free from anxiety and composed. ||183||

168. The forest land, filled with hundreds of harmful beings, was terrifying. Those ascetics, dwelling in those mixed nights, were absorbed in meditation. ||184||

169. They wandered through the forest regions, traversed by paths made by elephants. Those great ascetics resided in those places where the trees were broken by the tips of elephant tusks. ||185||

170. In the forests, where the echoes of the roars of wild elephants resounded, and which were infested by lion enemies, those ascetics resided. ||186||

171. Engaged in self-study and yoga, they did not sleep at night. Ever vigilant, they were devoted to contemplating the meaning of the Sutras. ||187||

172. Those heroes spent their nights sitting in the Paryanka posture, or in the Vira posture, or lying on their side, keeping their bodies still. ||188||

173. Those courageous ones, having abandoned the burden of possessions, with their bodies free from attachment, without any possessions, and perfectly pure, sought the path of liberation. ||189||

174. Free from expectations, devoid of desires, and like the wind, they wandered through this earth, filled with villages and cities. ||190||

175. Wandering through the entire earth, they were not hostile to anyone. Out of their compassionate nature, they considered all beings as their children and treated them like a mother. ||191||

176. Knowing the division of the living and the non-living, with their eyes shining with the light of knowledge, they carefully avoided consuming food from places inhabited by living beings. ||192||

177. They carefully avoided all actions that could lead to sin, for the sake of purifying the three jewels (right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct), throughout their lives. ||193||

178. They carefully protected themselves from harm to living beings, including trees, plants, earth, water, and fire. ||194||

Their bodies were emaciated by great fasts, yet they strived for the state of the body, and even in their minds, they did not desire impure food. ||206||
Having eaten the proper food, they quickly renounced it and went to the *tapovan*, becoming like heroes in *gochara*. ||207||
Even though their bodies were emaciated by the heat of *tapas*, the *munishwaras*, bound by the practice of *tapas*, did not abandon the *cheluiḍha sangra*. ||208||
There was slackness in the bodies of those who practiced intense *tapas*, but their vow, which was for the sake of proper *dhyana*, did not slacken. ||209||
Those who fasted for a long time were not defeated by the *parishatas*, but the *parishatas* themselves were unable to conquer them and were defeated. ||210||
Their brilliance surpassed that of others, like the brilliance of refined gold, due to the burning of *tapas*. ||211||
Their bodies, glowing with the heat of the fire of *tapas*, attained supreme inner purity. Just as gold is purified when the mold is heated, so too, the soul is purified when the body is heated. ||212||
Their bodies were reduced to skin and bones, yet they attained the supreme purity of *dhyana*. All these external actions are for the sake of inner purity. ||213||

The fire of penance was kindled, actions were the offerings, the wise ones were the sacrificers, the words of the Self-Existent were the mantras. The Lord Vrishabha was the master of the great sacrifice, compassion was the offering, the attainment of the desired object was the fruit, and liberation was the final stage of the action. Thus, having resolved upon this sacrifice as spoken by the Lord Rishabha, those ascetics initiated the great sacrifice of penance. || 215 - 217 || Thus, those sages, having pledged themselves to the noble sentiment of the sages, carried it out well, for this is the nature of great souls. || 218 || What is the use of saying much about this? All those sages, having abandoned all the vices that arise in the state of kingship, had brought under their control all the real actions that had been going on since time immemorial. || 219 ||

Thus, those who had attained the three jewels from the ancient man, the Lord Adinath, who were the beloved swans of his Tirtha-like Manasarovar, who had abandoned the kingdom and all kinds of delusion, who had been initiated only because they did not want to bow down to King Bharata, whose strength was excellent patience, who were always careful in the conduct of the wise and valiant sages, who followed the path adopted by the Lord Vrishabha, the king of yogis, and who

**Saluting the Universal Creator, the Lord of the Mobile and Immobile, the Divine, worshipped by the Indras, we do not seek refuge in any other. May those who have embraced the supreme initiation, having accepted the glory of their austerities, and who are the foremost among the Jainas, the sons of the resolute Vrishabhadeva, be auspicious for us.**

**He, the illustrious Bharata, could not win over those who were not humble, nor could he enjoy the entire earth by dividing it with them. Those who sought liberation, taking refuge in their father, the Jina Vrishabhadeva, may those munis, who possess the wealth of pride and who have burnt the fuel of karma, destroy our sins.**

**Thus ends the thirty-fourth chapter of the Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra, composed by the venerable Jinaseṇācārya, entitled "The Description of the Initiation of the Younger Brothers of King Bharata."**

The thirty-fifth chapter. Now, Chakradhara's mind was somewhat troubled. Two strong men had to be subdued, two arrogant ones. ||1|| Alas, our group of brothers does not rejoice in our joy. Thinking himself invincible due to his birth, he does not welcome our happiness. ||2|| "We are a hundred brothers, and we are invincible," is the belief of our group of brothers. Therefore, they have become my enemies, turning away from paying respects. ||3|| I do not feel such sorrow at the non-salutation of an enemy, as I do at the non-salutation of arrogant relatives living within the household. ||4|| Their mouths, ignited by the fire of unkind words, are filled with smoke, and driven by the wind of hostility, they burn me like a blazing fire. ||5|| Let other young men be hostile, if they wish. Those who have been nurtured by us from childhood with freedom. ||6|| But this young man, strong, wise, knowing the proper course of action, courteous, clever, and virtuous, how has he become hostile to us? ||7|| And how should this strong man, possessing wealth in the form of pride, be subdued now? His strength of arms is praised on the battlefield, the very limb of victory. ||8|| He is strong in his arms, powerful in his strength, intoxicated with pride. Like a maddened elephant, he is difficult to control without appeasement. ||9|| This arrogant man cannot be subdued by ordinary messages, for he is possessed by a wicked demon, like a demon possessed by a spell, without the use of mantras and spells. ||10||

There is a vast difference between the remaining Kshatriya youths and the mighty one. Just as a deer can be captured with a snare, can a lion be captured with the same snare? No. 

**Meaning:** Just as there is a difference between a deer and a lion, so too is there a difference between the other princes and the mighty one.

11. He is impenetrable due to his cunning, and cannot be subdued by force. His mind is filled with malice, so diplomacy is not an option.

**Meaning:**  It is futile to use any of the three methods of diplomacy, force, or deceit against him.

12. Just as a sacrificial fire burns even brighter when ghee is poured into it, so too does this mighty one, fueled by love, become even more inflamed with anger.

13. Just as a medicine applied to the skin of an elephant is useless, so too is diplomacy useless against this mighty one, who is inherently harsh.

14. The remaining princes, who have turned away from my command, abandoned their royal pleasures, and are headed for the forest, have already revealed his intentions.

15. Despite all this, we will still test him with gentle words. But if he remains unyielding, we must consider our next course of action.

16. This mighty one, with hidden malice disguised by kinship, is unstoppable. He is like a fire that erupts from within, consuming the entire family.

17. Just as a fire ignited by the friction of branches at the top of a tree can destroy a mountain, so too can anger arising from within, from family and kin, destroy a king.

18. This mighty one is currently leaning towards hostility, so we must act swiftly against him. For just as a cruel planet brings peace only when it is pacified, so too will we find peace only when he is subdued.

19. Having decided this, the Chakravarti sent a messenger, skilled in diplomacy and with a clear purpose.

20.  A wise man cannot be controlled without the knowledge of mantras.

Adipurana
The envoy, who was neither too young nor too old, mounted a suitable chariot and set out for his destination with a humble demeanor.  He was accompanied by a loyal servant, who carried all the necessary provisions for the journey, and who was also a close friend.  The envoy thought to himself, "If he speaks favorably, I will respond in kind without boasting. If he speaks of war, I will strive to prevent it."  He further reasoned, "If he desires a treaty or a gift, I am in agreement. But if he seeks to conquer the emperor, I will fight back with all my might and return swiftly."  He considered the prosperity of his own side and the adversity of the other, and remained impenetrable to the schemes of other ministers due to his ability to keep his own counsel.  Fearing treachery, he slept alone in a secluded spot at his encampment, and continued his journey, observing the battlefields and escape routes.  He traversed many lands, rivers, and borders, and after many nights, arrived at the city of Podanapura, the capital of Bahubali.  Upon reaching the outskirts of the city, he was delighted to see the beautiful, fertile land, with its fields of ripe rice.  He saw the stalks of rice, laden with fruit, and guarded by farmers, and thought to himself, "These people are very self-interested."  He saw the farmers, dancing with joy, their sickles raised high, celebrating the harvest.  He heard the sounds of their laughter and merriment, and he was filled with a sense of peace.  The emperor Bharat had sent a messenger, a man of great strength, to Bahubali.  This messenger was a "nisrishtaarthe dooth," meaning that he was entrusted with the responsibility of achieving the emperor's objectives.  He was a loyal servant who acted according to the situation, always protecting the emperor's interests.

## The Thirty-Fifth Chapter

175.  He saw, in some paddy fields, clusters of grains, some of which had been snatched away by parrots, looking like women enjoyed by men of low caste. 
31.  The fragrant paddy, exhaling a sweet scent, perfumed the directions with its breath, adorned with paddy ears as earrings. 
32.  They were adorned with pearl-like ornaments, created by drops of sweat falling from their plump breasts. 
33.  They wore braids adorned with garlands of blue lotuses, their foreheads decorated with pollen-dusted kumkum. 
34.  They bore, like tiny particles of beauty, drops of sweat born of toil, clinging to their sun-weary faces. 
35.  He saw the paddy-guarding women, their bodies adorned with green blouses, the color of parrot feathers, chasing away the parrots with their charming cries. 
36.  He saw sugarcane fields, the sound of the grinding mills echoing like cries of pain, as if they were suffering from extreme distress. 
37.  He saw newly-delivered cows, their bodies heavy with milk, moving slowly, burdened by their large breasts, and eager for their calves. 
38.  Thus, seeing the beautiful outskirts of the city, he felt fulfilled, having witnessed this joyous spectacle. 
39.  The land outside the city, with its canals flowing with water, surrounded by fields of paddy, sugarcane, and cumin, captivated his mind. 
40.  The city's outskirts, with their wells, tanks, gardens, and clusters of lotuses, appeared to him like a beautiful garland. 
41.  Passing through the city gates, he observed the merchants' paths, where he saw heaps of jewels, as if they were piled up. 
42.  The messenger also heard the sound of the gourd, a sound that praised the farmers and their families, a sound that marked the struggle of harvesting the fields.

##  Verse 176

**43.** Seeing the courtyard, which was muddy with the spittle and rutting water of the horses and elephants that had come as gifts for the king, and which looked as if it had been sprinkled with water, the messenger was very pleased.

**44.** Having been informed of the events by the chief gatekeepers, the messenger approached the king, who was seated on his throne.

**45.** With his broad chest, his tall crown like a peak, he appeared like a single mountain for the sport of the goddess of victory, Lakshmi.

**46.** Wearing a wide forehead band, adorned with a band, he appeared as if he were wearing the auspicious wedding garland of the goddess of victory.

**47.** Holding a strong arm like the beam of a balance, which had weighed the glory of all kings, and which bore the weight of the entire earth.

**48.** Although he possessed the beauty of a lotus in his face and the splendor of a blue lotus in his eyes, he was not of a mixed breed, nor was he a reservoir of water.

**49.** He possessed a very vast mind and chest, which were the permanent abode of the goddesses of speech, Saraswati, and wealth, Lakshmi.

**50.** He was constantly engaged in protecting his subjects and in cultivating the group of virtues that bore great fruit, both in his own body and in the minds of the great.

**51.** With the brilliance of his shining ornaments, he seemed to be anointing all directions with the fire of his prowess.

**52.** With a face like a moonstone, beautiful feet like a ruby, and a body as strong as a diamond, he was shining.

**42.** Seeing the path through the market, which was being trampled by the feet of the people, the messenger began to consider the piles of jewels there as treasures.

The thirty-fifth chapter is about the green jewel-like pillar, green in hue. It was created by the power of creation to support the world.  ||53||  The king, adorned with all the qualities of a Kshatriya, was radiating with brilliance. He was indeed made up of atoms of pure energy. ||54||  Seeing him from afar, like a blazing fire, the messenger was slightly shaken, his mind wavering. ||55||  He bowed down, touching the feet of the king, and with his head bowed, he was seated by the prince, not too far away. ||56||  The prince, seated on a suitable seat, addressed the messenger, his smile illuminating the world. ||57||  "Today, after a long time, we are remembered by the wheel-bearer. O blessed one, is the well-being of the lord of the world, the wielder of the wheel, who is concerned with many, well?" ||58||  "He who has not yet completed the task of conquering all the Kshatriyas, is the famous right arm of the king of kings, Bharata, well?" ||59||  "It is heard that Bharata has subdued all directions and conquered all kings. O messenger, tell me, is there still some task left for him, or not?" ||60||  Speaking thus, the prince, with his calm energy, concise words, and measured speech, gave the messenger an opportunity to speak. ||61||  The messenger, ready to speak, with his teeth shining, showed the unity of words and meaning. ||62||  "O lord, in the mirror of your words, the future task is clearly seen, for even a fool like me can understand its meaning." ||63||  "O lord, we are messengers, only carriers of the king's message. We are slow in understanding the merits and demerits, and we follow the dictates of our master." ||64||

Adipuranam, then what was commanded by the Chakravartin, that is dear and proper. It is to be accepted, whether good or bad, only because of the respect for the speaker. ||65|| The words of the Guru are to be accepted without any alternative, this is the excess. Considering that as evidence, you should now accept the command of the Chakravartin. ||66|| Ikshvaku is the first of the kings, Bharata is your elder brother. He has conquered the entire earth, making even the immortals bow to him. ||67|| Crossing the Ganga river, he rode in his chariot, unopposed, through the ocean, whose waves are constantly crashing against each other. ||68|| The fire of his prowess, fueled by his arrows, burns even in the water of the ocean. He has not only drunk the ocean, but also the pride of the gods. ||69|| How could the gods not bow to him? He has captured them with his net of arrows, forcibly binding them to his will. ||70|| His arrows, which travel twelve yojanas, have forcibly targeted the dwelling place of Magadhadeva, who resides in the great ocean. ||71|| The gods have proclaimed the victory of Bharata, who has conquered Vijayadeva, the lord of Vijayardha mountain, with his unerring arrows. ||72|| Kritamala and other gods have come under his control, and the Vidyaadharas of both the northern and southern regions have proclaimed his victory. ||73|| He has crossed the entrance of the cave, which was filled with darkness, with his victorious army, and has also taken control of the land in the northern direction of Vijayardha mountain. ||74|| Even though the Mlechchhas did not want to obey his command, he has achieved victory through his army commander, forcibly taking their wealth. ||75||

Letter Thirtieth
He whose coronation was performed by the best of the gods, whose fame is like a lotus on the peaks of the immovable mountains, ||76|| whom the gods of the Ganga and Sindhu rivers worship with offerings of jewels, whose fame is engraved on the banks of the Vrishabha mountain, ||77|| whose Lakshmi is like a water-carrier, whose gods are his servants, whose treasures are filled with jewels and wealth, ||78|| whose victorious armies have conquered all directions and roam the forests and lands on the shores of all the oceans, ||79||  O Ayushman, the world-renowned king Bharat, honoring you with auspicious blessings, is proclaiming his kingship, ||80||  for this our kingdom, which extends to all islands and oceans, does not shine without our beloved brother Bahubali. ||81||  Those riches, that wealth, those pleasures, and those possessions are to be enjoyed together by brothers, sharing the joy of their rise. ||82||  Furthermore, his kingship does not shine without your obeisance, for all men, gods, Dharmendra, and Vidyadharas bow down to him. ||83||  A foe who does not bow down does not grieve the king's heart as much as a brother who, thinking himself clever, does not bow down out of pride. ||84||  Therefore, go to the king Bharat, who does not forgive any offense, and honor him with obeisance, for bowing down to the king is the source of many riches and is desired by all. ||85||  His wheel-jewel, which rules over those who violate the commands of Bharat, whose commands never go in vain, is itself not ruled by anyone. ||86||  See these lords of the mandala, who are distressed by the violation of Bharat's commands, who are shattered by the fall of the terrible thunderbolt of punishment. ||87||

Adipurana 'Thus, O long-lived Kumar, you should quickly go and fulfill his desire. The entire world will be united by the union of you two brothers.' ||8||

Thus, after the messenger had spoken, the clever and young Bahubali Kumar, with a slight smile, spoke words full of wisdom and courage. ||89||

He said, "O messenger, you have spoken the truth, revealing the virtuous conduct of your master. For it is right to speak what strengthens one's own opinion." ||90||

"You have shown peace, but you have also shown the difference and punishment, especially. By using them, you have shown how independent you are in achieving your goal." ||91||

"You are truly the intimate messenger of your independent master. Otherwise, how could you have revealed his heart's intention?" ||92||

"The Chakravarti has entrusted you with all the responsibilities and sent you to me. Although you are clever, it is not cleverness to dissect the heart of another." ||93||

"To show your force is the work of the wicked, and to describe your own virtues and reveal faults in others is also the work of the wicked." ||94||

"Wicked men describe the faults of others and their own virtues, and they hide their own faults and the virtues of others." ||95||

"Ignorant people take refuge in wickedness, which is like a sky vine, because just as a sky vine does not remove anyone's suffering, so too wickedness does not remove anyone's suffering. Just as a sky vine is devoid of flowers, so too wickedness is devoid of wise men, and just as a sky vine is fruitless, so too wickedness is fruitless, meaning it does not benefit anyone." ||96||

"I consider this wickedness, which is not liked by virtuous men, which is filled with bitter fruits everywhere, and which causes suffering to people, to be a vine of sorrow." ||97||

"Even if peace is used in the beginning, it is bound to be obstructed by the difference and punishment, when it comes to a man who opposes justly." ||98||

## Chapter Thirty-Five

The application of these means will lead to success, while their misapplication will lead to defeat. ||19||

The use of *Sama* (conciliation) alone is not considered effective in pacifying a powerful person. It is like pouring water on burning ghee. ||100||

Similarly, I consider it futile to offer something to a very powerful person. Just as a blazing fire cannot be extinguished by offering thousands of fuel sticks, how can a powerful person be pacified by mere offerings? ||101||

Just as heated iron does not become soft, a powerful person does not become soft by being subjected to punishment. Punishment can be effective only on an elephant that can be controlled by love and care, not on a lion. ||102||

Therefore, those who misapply these means, and are thus ignorant of their proper use, suffer themselves. ||103||

**10**

**1**

**181**

If *Sama* (conciliation) is used first, followed by *Bheda* (division) and *Danda* (punishment), the *Sama* used earlier becomes ineffective.

**Meaning:** If a just opponent is first tempted by offering something, using *Sama* (conciliation), and then threatened with *Bheda* (division) and *Danda* (punishment), the earlier use of *Sama* becomes futile. This is because the just opponent easily understands the cunning. ||18||

The proper application of these four means, *Sama*, *Dama*, *Danda*, and *Bheda*, in their respective places, is the cause of success, while their misapplication is the cause of defeat.

**Meaning:** Success is achieved by using the appropriate means with the appropriate person, while using the wrong means leads to rejection. ||99||

The use of *Sama* (conciliation) with a powerful person cannot be considered as a means of pacifying him alone. Even if a powerful person is friendly, if he becomes enraged, using *Sama* with him is like pouring water on burning ghee.

**Meaning:** Just as pouring water on burning ghee does not extinguish it but makes it sputter even more, similarly, a person in anger does not become calm by conciliatory behavior but becomes even more agitated. ||100||

In the same way, I consider it futile to offer something to a very powerful person. How can a blazing fire be extinguished by offering thousands of fuel sticks?

**Meaning:** Just as heated iron does not become soft, a powerful person does not become soft by being subjected to punishment. Punishment can be effective only on an elephant that can be controlled by love and care, not on a lion. ||102||

Therefore, those who misapply these means, and are thus ignorant of their proper use, suffer themselves. ||103||

**Notes:**

1. *Sama*, *Dama*, *Danda*, and *Bheda* are the four traditional means of statecraft in Indian political thought.
2. *Sama* means conciliation, *Dama* means bribery, *Danda* means punishment, and *Bheda* means division.
3. The text uses the analogy of heated iron to illustrate the point that a powerful person cannot be softened by punishment.
4. The text also uses the analogy of an elephant and a lion to illustrate the point that punishment is effective only on those who can be controlled by love and care.
5. The text emphasizes the importance of using the right means in the right place.
6. The text warns against the dangers of misapplying these means.
7. The text suggests that those who are ignorant of the proper use of these means will suffer themselves.

Even though it is certain that we cannot be subdued by peace, you are using arrogance with us, this clearly shows that you are a fool. ||104||
The king of Bharata is older, but that alone does not make him praiseworthy, because even an old elephant can't match a lion cub. ||105||
O messenger, love and respect are possible only among those who are closely related, if there is conflict among them, then both their paths are destroyed. Meaning- As long as there is harmony among relatives, both love and respect remain, and as soon as there is conflict among them, both are destroyed. ||106||
It is good to greet the elder brother at other times, but what kind of custom is it to bow down to someone who has placed a sword on his head? ||107||
O messenger, our minds are saddened by following the arrogance of others, because there is only one sun in the world that is radiant. Is there anyone else more radiant than him? ||108||
Adi Brahma Bhagwan has given the word 'Raja' to me and Bharata, but today Bharata has become 'Rajraja', which is as useless as a gourd growing on the cheek. ||109||
Or let Bharata be 'Rajraja' if he wants, let him be greedy for jewels, we will remain steadfast in our righteous kingdom as kings. ||110||
Bharata wants to give us some land by deceiving us like children and making us bow down, but the piece of land given by him seems as insignificant as a piece of clay. ||111||
For those who are radiant, whatever little fruit they get from their own arm-like tree is praiseworthy, for them, the wealth of the earth up to the four seas, obtained by the gesture of the eyebrow, i.e., the fruit of the creeper of the eyebrow, is not praiseworthy. ||112||

## Chapter Thirty-Five

**113.** The king who, though a king, holds wealth that has been diminished by the command of another, makes the word "king" meaningless, like a drum that is struck but does not produce sound.

**114.** The king who, though a king, holds prosperity that is stained by the humiliation of another, surely bears the burden of all his kingdom like a beast of burden.

**115.** How can there be a difference between a man and a beast, when the man, like an elephant whose tusks have been broken, seeks to sustain his life by enjoying the pleasures gained through humiliation?

**116.** The king who bears his head bowed down under the weight of humiliation, loses his shadow even without the breaking of his umbrella. (Here, the word "shadow" has two meanings: protection from the sun and radiance. When the umbrella is broken, the shadow, meaning protection from the sun, is lost. But here, the loss of shadow is described even without the breaking of the umbrella. This seems contradictory, but it can be resolved by understanding that the loss of shadow refers to the loss of radiance, which happens even without the breaking of the umbrella.)

**117.** If even those who have renounced all material possessions are filled with pride (self-respect), then what man, desiring to enjoy the kingdom, would abandon his pride?

**118.** It is better to live in the forest, and it is better to give up one's life, but it is not good for a man who is proud of his lineage to be subservient to another.

**119.** Let the brave and wise men protect their pride with their mortal lives, for the glory earned through pride always adorns the world.

**120.** You have exaggerated the prowess of the emperor, but that is alright, because all your words are aimed at both praise and blame, meaning they are praise that also hints at blame.

**121.** Wise men can make even the most insignificant things seem substantial with their words. Just as a dog is called a lion when praise begins, so too is this praise.

**122.** All this talk seems insignificant to us. Where is the beginning of conquest? Where is the gathering of wealth? 

Page #202:

## Adipurana 90

**127.** Even though he is the protector of his clan, he is defiled by the dust of sin. 

**128.** O messenger, without shame, how much do you praise the prowess of this Bharata, who, by means of mantras and tantras, summons many kings from afar?

**129.** O messenger, when you praise his war, we are filled with great sorrow, because at that time, Bharata's army was swaying like a swing in the water, due to the Mlechchha army.

**130.** A Kshatriya son should protect the wealth of glory, which cannot be stolen, because in this earth, many people who buried treasures have died.

**131.** What is the use of those gems that do not even reach the earth? Kings only attain death.

**122.** This entire act appears to us as mere verbal pomp, because how can one begin a Digvijaya and at the same time be eager to accumulate wealth?

**123.** Just as a mendicant, wearing a begging bowl, attains extreme poverty by begging, in the same way, your master Bharata, by wearing the Chakra (wheel) and collecting taxes like alms, has been brought to the extreme limit of poverty by you.

**124-125.** It is true that the Chakravarti conquered even the gods during his Digvijaya, but this is only believable. Otherwise, you should consider this: when your master Bharata, who was engaged in stopping the flow of water, released an arrow, he was not sleeping on a bed of Darbha grass, nor was he fasting.

**126.** Just as a potter, using a long, beautiful stick, rotates the wheel and makes earthen pots, in the same way, Bharata, using a beautiful stick (Dandaratna), rotates the wheel (Chakra Ratna) and subjugates the kings of the earth. Therefore, it must be said that your king behaves like a potter.

**127.** He, Bharata, has become defiled by scattering the dust of sin, and he is also defiling the clan of noble men forever.

**130.**  A Kshatriya son should protect the wealth of glory, which cannot be stolen, because in this earth, many people who buried treasures have died.

**131.** Or, what can be gained from those gems that do not even reach the earth? Kings only attain death.

The Thirty-Fifth Chapter

185. This Bharata, who has been weighed by all the kings with a heap of jewels, is a Tulapurusha. Alas, such wealth does not exist. ||132||

133. Surely, he desires to seize our earth, which was given by our revered father, Lord Vrishabhadeva. There is no remedy other than rejecting this greedy one. ||133||

134. O messenger, this earth, given by our father, is like a brother's wife to Bharata. Now he desires to take it. Does your master have no shame? ||134||

135. Those who are independent and desire to conquer their enemies at will, can give away everything else, leaving behind their family and the earth won by their arms. ||135||

136. It is futile to speak much. Let Bharata enjoy this earth marked by a single umbrella, or let me, the valiant one, enjoy it. Meaning: He cannot enjoy this earth without defeating me. ||136||

137. What is the use of these vain words of valor, which are devoid of the accomplishment of the purpose? Now, our valor, mine and Bharata's, should be revealed on the anvil of battle. ||137||

138. Therefore, O messenger, take this our unambiguous word, and tell Bharata that whatever is to be, will be in the midst of the battle. ||138||

139. Thus, the valiant prince, having expressed his pride, quickly dismissed the messenger, saying, "Go and quickly prepare your master for battle." ||139||

140. At that time, the kings, whose crowns clashed, causing millions of jewels to fly about, and whose jewels seemed to be scattering hundreds of sparks of fire, stood up. ||140||

141. At that moment, in the army of the great king Bahubali, filled with many warriors, the sound of the warriors' mutual conversation, announcing the clash of battle, was heard. ||141||

142. This preparation for battle by our master has taken a long time. Will we now be able to repay the favor of our master? Meaning: What great favor our master has done to us by nurturing us till now, will we be able to repay it? ||142||

The kings nourish their servants for a special occasion. If that occasion is not achieved, then what is the use of these men made of straw? (143) This body should be abandoned, the wealth of fame should be earned, and victory should be achieved, the victory of Lakshmi should be obtained, this festival of war is not going to yield much fruit. (144) We, with our bodies, each limb of which is scarred with wounds, and on which the shadow of the arrows that have dulled the sun's rays falls, when will we find rest in this battlefield? (145) Someone said, "When will I, with my arrows, pierce through the many formations made by the enemy army, and lie down on a bed of arrows without any disturbance?" (146) Someone said, "When will I, overcome by fatigue in the battle, lie down for a moment on the shoulder of an elephant, whose ears, like palm leaves, have been cleansed by the wind, and whose fatigue has been removed by the battle?" (147) When will I, with my intestines hanging out from the tusks of the elephant, and with my mouth uttering broken words, become the target of the glances of victorious Lakshmi? (148) Someone said, "When will I, with my intestines hanging like a strong rope between the tusks of the elephants, weigh the victory of Lakshmi, as if she were on a swing?" (149) Thus speaking, the great warriors, lovers of war, in each army, took up their weapons and helmets. (150) Then, as if frightened by the frowns of the warriors, the day seemed to flee somewhere. (151) Then, the disc of the sun turned red, as if it had taken on the red hue given by the shadow of the eyes of the angry army of warriors. (152) At that time, for a moment, the group of rays of the sun, with the leaves of the trees on the slopes of the western mountains, appeared to be covered with the red hue of the setting sun. (153)

## Canto 35

187
The sun, clinging to the peak of Karagiri, seemed to be falling for a moment. The Karalas, fearing its fall, seemed to be holding onto its rays as if they were hands. ||154||

The sun, falling due to its union with Varuni, its radiance lost, was not supported by the Karalas, as if they were afraid of it. ||155||

Has the sun gone to search for the past day, or has it entered the Rasatal? Or has it hidden behind the peaks of the Astal? ||156||

Like a valiant man, who destroys darkness, the embodiment of poverty, and attacks the kings with his taxes, and at the end of his fortune, walks about without clothes, so too, the sun, destroying the darkness of the night, and attacking the mountains with its rays, at the end of the day, walks about without its rays. How sorrowful! ||157||

This sun, constantly revolving around Mount Meru in a circular, slanting motion, is not visible from afar, and therefore, foolish men think it is falling. ||158||

In this misfortune of the sun, the directions, like women afflicted with grief, have become devoid of radiance, their faces filled with darkness. ||159||

**Notes:**

* **Karagiri:** A mountain, possibly the same as Mount Meru.
* **Karalas:** The rays of the sun.
* **Varuni:** The west, also a metaphor for alcohol.
* **Rasatal:** The underworld.
* **Astal:** The setting sun.
* **Bhaanu:** The sun.
* **Vibhavasu:** Radiance.
* **Ananshuk:** Without clothes, a metaphor for the sun without its rays.
* **Meru:** A mythical mountain, considered the center of the universe.
* **Tirya-mandala:** The circular path of the sun.
* **Diggana:** The directions.

The people, with their eyes opened in that dense darkness, could not see anything in front of them, being deluded by false perception. ||171||

Forced by the darkness, the people were agitated within, their vision failing them, so they considered sleep to be the best option. ||172||

The lamps, lit in every house, were shining brightly, as if countless needles were prepared to pierce the dense darkness. ||173||

At that moment, the moon, destroying the darkness with its radiant rays, rose, as if bathing the world in milk. ||174||

That moon, rising to bring joy to the world, was like a noble king, for just as a noble king holds his entire kingdom with love, so too does the moon hold its entire disc with radiance. And just as a noble king spreads his power throughout his kingdom, so too does the moon spread its rays throughout the world. ||175||

Seeing the moon, marked with the symbol of a deer, the darkness fled, even though it was vast, just as a large herd of elephants flees upon seeing a lion that has captured a deer. ||176||

The group of moonbeams, with rows of stars spread out, appeared like a flow of the sky-ocean, filled with bubbles, pouring down from above. ||177||

Like a young swan, the moon, searching for the seaweed of darkness, was swimming in the sky-lake, filled with swan-like stars. ||178||

Destroying all darkness and filling the world with its rays, the moon made the entire world like nectar at that time. ||179||

Even after removing the darkness, the moon remained stained. This is right, because natural darkness is very difficult to overcome, even for great men. ||180||

This must be a woman who is wearing a blue garment and adorned with shining pearls. ||170||

The sun, with his rays like hands, opened the doors of darkness and illuminated the faces of the directions. The whole world opened its eyes. ||22||

Rising early in the morning, the sun, like a victorious king, embraced the lotus-like dawn. ||225||

With beautiful voices, the guards, even though the king was already awake, roused him with their auspicious chants. ||226||

O best of men, the sun, who brings joy to the world and is praised by all, is rising in the east, spreading his radiant light. Therefore, you too, following the auspicious rituals of sunrise, should leave your bed to illuminate the world and bring joy to Lakshmi. ||227||

O king of kings, your armies have conquered countless powerful kings. These small-minded people are mostly unaware of the strength of your arms. O valiant warrior, you have striven for victory in battle alongside the lord of Bharata. Therefore, you shall be the master of victory and Lakshmi. ||228||

The sun, with his rays like a shower of tiny snowflakes, quickly wipes away the dew drops on the branches of the garden trees. Rising in the midst of a forest of lotuses, he seems to be receiving an offering from them, as if they are welcoming him with open eyes. ||229||

The 35th chapter: Following his beloved, who is lying on the bank, this kokila (cuckoo) is emitting sorrow, as if shedding tears continuously.  He is slowly entering the lotus pond, whose banks are covered with twenty-two lotus leaves, his wings covered with lotus pollen. ||230|| This moon, which is stealing the luster of the ripe mṛṇāla (a type of water lily), is drawing its own luster from all directions, and spreading its nectar-like rays over every group of kumudinis (night-blooming water lilies), as if strengthening the bond of embrace with them out of fear of separation. ||231|| Piercing through the group of darkness-like elephants, and bearing a body (orb) that appears red, as if soaked in their blood, and whose star-like eyes are obscured or distorted due to sleep, this lion-like moon, having crossed the sky, which is like a forest, is now taking refuge in the secluded place of the setting sun. ||232|| As the sun rises, the swans and sārasa birds are going to the banks of the lake, accompanied by their calls. The pairs of kokilas are meeting each other, as if their curse has now been lifted. The flocks of birds are settling on the trees, making sounds all around, and the world seems to have returned to its former state. ||233|| The dawn, with its red hue like the lotuses born on the cliffs of the rising sun, and its beauty like a coral forest in the sky-like ocean, is spreading its red luster, like a vermilion-colored door, and adorning the face of the sky. ||234||

The Adipurana, like a lotus, is about to be enveloped by the buzzing of bees, the sun's rays having turned reddish. It seems as if the fireflies are spreading their light, and the bee, afraid, is unable to enter. Alas, for the foolish, who are always in danger and turn away from wisdom! ||235||
O King, the wind, which shakes the trees of the grove, makes the bees dance, has become familiar with the waves in the lotus pond, attracts the fragrance of love, and is heavy with lotus pollen, is blowing gently in all directions. ||236||
O King of Kings, awaken again with these auspicious blessings of the Jina, in whom the victory cry is proclaimed. For by these blessings, all your obstacles will be completely pacified, like the desire of the lover for the goddess of victory on the battlefield. ||237||
Victorious, adorned with the worship of the gods, cleansed of the dust of sin, free from attachment, his feet are slightly yellowed by the beautiful rays of the jewels in the crowns of the gods, who bow down to him. ||238||

The Ashoka tree, the Dundubhi, the rain of flowers, the Chamara, the excellent throne, the incomparable words, the high umbrella, and the Bhamandala - these eight wonders are the signs of his conquest of the three worlds. He is the well-wisher of all, the glorious Vrishabhanatha Jinendra, ever victorious! || 244 ||

His lotus-like feet destroy the suffering of birth, they bestow great fruits like heaven and liberation, and Indra is his bee. He satisfies those who come to him for refuge, like a Kalpavriksha. Such is the Tirthankara, ever victorious, protecting you all with his vast magnificence. || 245 ||

O best of men, even King Bharata cannot compare to your two arms, which are like the bars of a prison. And what of strength? When you approach the battlefield, who among the kings can stand before you, merely by seeing you? || 246 ||

Therefore, O ruler, do not waste time, abandon sleep, be ever vigilant in this great task. Quickly obtain victory and Lakshmi, and again bow down with devotion to the Lord of Lords, the Jinendra, who rules over all for victory. || 247 ||

Thus, with these auspicious words, well-composed and full of praise, the king, like a celestial elephant, slowly rose from his bed, abandoning sleep, and went to the bank of the Ganga. || 248 ||

## Chapter 35: The Description of Kumar Bahubali's War Efforts

**129**

With auspicious songs of victory, which are excellent and fit for kings, the great king Bahubali awoke to achieve victory. Just as the elephant Airavata, upon waking from sleep, gradually leaves the banks of the Ganges, so too did he gradually leave his bed upon waking. 

**248**

He, whose glory is enhanced by the chieftains of his army, who himself possesses immense strength, and whom many kings from afar come to see and pay homage to, this young Bahubali, intoxicated with victory, blocked the directions with the clouds of his victorious elephants, and proceeded with his army to the battlefield. 

**242**

Thus ends the thirty-fifth chapter of the *Trishatshalaka Mahapurana Sangraha*, composed by the *Arsha* (venerable) Bhagavatzinaseenacharya, which describes the war efforts of Kumar Bahubali.

Then, the message of the messenger, like a fierce wind, struck the emperor's army, causing the ocean of his forces to move, blocking the sky and the earth. ||1||

At that time, the great war drums, announcing the battle, sounded deep, and the Vidyadharas, terrified, were eager to wield their swords. ||2||

The emperor's forces were divided into different sections: the infantry in the front, followed by the cavalry, and then the elephants. ||3||

On both sides of the army were chariots, and above and behind them were the Vidyadharas and the Devas. ||4||

Equipped with all six types of military forces, the king of the Bharatas, desiring to conquer his younger brother, set out with many kings. ||5||

A great multitude of elephants, adorned with victory flags, shone brightly, resembling a group of mountains moving with their trees. ||6||

The emperor Bharat, accompanied by elephants whose maddening roars filled the sky and whose flowing mad-water drenched the earth, moved forward, resembling mountains with waterfalls. ||7||

The victorious elephants, adorned with ornaments, stood tall, resembling mountains covered in the dense heat of the evening. ||8||

The elephants of the army, adorned with all kinds of ornaments and bearing victory flags, appeared like mountains, as if they had come to show their strength to the emperor Bharat. ||9||

The elephant riders, seated on the backs of the elephants, holding their ankushas, adorned with brilliant and heroic attire, appeared as if they were all one. ||10||

The cavalrymen, with their sharp swords, were like embodiments of valor, their arms adorned with their own prowess. **(11)**

The archers, with their quivers full of arrows, resembled great trees of the forest, adorned with their branches and hollows. **(12)**

The charioteers, with their chariots laden with weapons, were like sailors setting out to cross the sea of battle. **(13)**

The warriors, with their helmets and armor, and their sharp swords raised high, marched before the elephants to protect their feet. **(14)**

The warriors, with their shining weapons and iron armor, blazed like dark clouds with lightning, announcing a storm. **(15)**

Another warrior, holding a sharp sword in his hand, looked at its reflection in his face and recognized his own valor. **(16)**

Another warrior, weighing the sword in his hand, seemed to be measuring the honor and respect due to his master. **(17)**

The armies of the kings, adorned with great crowns, marched forth with their infantry, elephants, cavalry, and chariots. **(18)**

These crowned kings, with their crowns adorned with jewels, shone like the portions of the guardians of the world who had descended to earth. **(19)**

Many kings surrounded King Bharata, displaying their forces from afar, as was proper. **(20)**

**22**

The warriors, their hearts filled with excitement at the sound of the approaching battle, reassured each other with words of courage. **(21)**

**22** The dust raised by the horses' hooves, soaring through the sky, momentarily obstructed the vision of the celestial maidens.

**23** In the darkness caused by the dust, spreading in all directions and engulfing the sky, the brilliance of the Chakra Ratna illuminated the eyes of the people, guiding them towards their respective destinations.

**24** The kings, filled with the intense spirit of valor, were energized by the conversations of the warriors and the words of others like them, as they embarked on their journey.

**25** Standing afar, King Bahubali was preparing the battlefield, while the lion-like King Bharat, unrestrained, was advancing towards him.

**26** It is uncertain what will become of these two brothers in this war.  It is unlikely that this war will bring peace to their followers.

**27** It is indeed unfortunate that King Bharat has initiated this war.  Those who are intoxicated by their power and cannot be restrained are prone to acting on their own whims.

**28** Can these crowned kings, who have come to fight with all their resources, not stop these two?

**29** Oh, this prince Bahubali, possessing the strength of his arms, is truly magnificent.  Even when the Chakra-bearer is enraged, he stands face-to-face, ready for battle.

**30**  Victory does not necessarily come from having more resources, for even a single lion can conquer a herd of elephants.

**31** This Chakra-bearer, Bharat, is not an ordinary man.  He is protected by thousands of gods who bow down to him.

**32** Therefore, it is better that this war, which will cause the destruction of countless lives, does not happen.  If the gods are present here, let them bring peace to this conflict.

**33** Some people, advocating for peace, spoke words worthy of praise.  Others, blinded by partisanship, spoke in favor of their own side. 

Page #221:
---------------------------
## The Thirty-Fourth Chapter

**34.**  Thus, often beguiled by the words of people, the kings quickly reached the place where the valiant Kumar Bahubali was already present.

**35.**  Upon reaching Bahubali's vicinity, the warriors of Bharata, seeing the pride of Bahubali's arms, which no enemy could ever transgress, were somewhat frightened.

**36.**  Thus, upon the arrival of the army of Chakravarti Bharata, the army of Bahubali, filled with the sounds of heroes, became agitated like the waters of the ocean.

**37.**  Then, the valiant warriors of both armies, desiring to fight, began to arrange their armies, adorned with elephants, horses, and other paraphernalia, and to form various formations.

**38.**  Meanwhile, the chief ministers of both sides, after deliberation, said, "This war between these two, like that of cruel planets, is not for peace."

**39.**  "For these two are of supreme physique, and there will be no harm to them. Only the people of both sides will be destroyed under the pretext of this war."

**40.**  Thus, having decided and fearing the destruction of many people, the ministers, with the permission of both, declared a righteous war.

**41.**  "There is no benefit from this senseless war, which destroys people. It will lead to great sin and the destruction of fame."

**42.**  "This test of strength can be done in other ways. Therefore, let there be a three-fold war between you two."

**43.**  "The defeat in this war should be borne by you both without any frown, and the victory should also be borne without arrogance. This is the dharma of brothers."

**44.**  Thus, when all the kings and ministers urged them with great insistence, the two valiant brothers, with great difficulty, agreed to such a war.

**33.**  And many were praising their own side, motivated by partiality.

## Adipurana

**45.** In the battles of water, sight, and arms, whoever emerges victorious shall be the self-chosen husband of Jayashri, the goddess of victory.

**46.** Thus, with the deep sound of the drums, bringing joy to all, the ministers gathered the chief warriors of both armies.

**47.** The kings who were on Bharat's side were seated on one side, and those who were on Bahubali's side were seated on the other.

**48.** In the midst of all these kings, Bharat and Bahubali stood resplendent, as if the mountains of Nishadha and Nila had come together by some chance.

**49.** Bahubali, with his body adorned with the beauty of sapphire, and his hair as black as night, appeared like a tall Jambū tree, buzzing with bees.

**50.** Similarly, the king of kings, Bharat, with his body towering with a crown, and his complexion like molten gold, appeared like Mount Sumeru, adorned with a peak.

**51.** With unwavering, tranquil gaze, and great patience, Bahubali quickly won the battle of sight.

**52.** The kings, seeing the surging tide of Bahubali's army, restrained their own forces, and with great respect, acknowledged Bahubali's victory in the battle of sight.

**53.** Then, filled with pride, like intoxicated elephants, the two brothers entered the lake for the water battle, and with their long arms, they splashed water at each other.

**54.** The bright spray of water, flung by Bahubali at Bharat's chest, appeared like a stream flowing through the heart of Mount Sumeru.

**55.** The powerful stream of water, released by Bharat, passed far beyond Bahubali's face, falling down at a distance.

Bharateshvara, even in this battle, did not achieve victory. The victory was again proclaimed by the forces of Bhujabali. ||56||

The two lion-like warriors, Nrisimha and Bhujabali, both eager for battle, entered the arena. ||57||

The great arm-wrestling match between the two brothers, adorned with the pride of their arms, involved much shaking, striking, maneuvering, and exercise of their arms. ||58||

Bhujabali, in a playful manner, spun around Bharat, whose crown shone brightly. In that moment, the emperor, while spinning, assumed the playful posture of the Aalatchakra. ||59||

Bhujabali, having conquered the greatest of kings, the elder and the conqueror of the Bharat region, did not, out of respect, throw him to the ground. ||60||

Instead, he lifted him up with his arms and placed him on his shoulder. At that time, Bhujabali, carrying Bharateshvara on his shoulder, appeared as if the great Himalayas, adorned with its peaks, were being carried by the blue mountain. ||61||

At that time, the kings on Bhujabali's side raised a great clamor, while the people on Bharat's side bowed their heads in shame. ||62||

Seeing this in front of them, the kings of both sides were filled with great shame and wonder. ||63||

The emperor, with furrowed brows, blood-red eyes, and burning with anger, became momentarily unseeable. ||64||

Blinded by anger, the lord of treasures, Bharat, remembered the Chakra Ratna, which uprooted and threw away the entire group of enemies, to defeat Bhujabali. ||65||

As soon as he remembered, the Chakra Ratna came near Bharat. Bharat, aiming at Bhujabali,

"The Adipurana is done, it is done," said the king, but he was rebuked by Bahubali for his arrogance. Then the great Chakravarti went to the extreme of human behavior. ||6|| "You have done a great deed," said Bahubali, weighing the chakra in his hands. The valiant Bahubali, seeing the king's arrogance, lowered the chakra to the ground. ||68||  He was honored by the best of kings, who praised his victory. At that time, the strong-armed Bahubali felt himself elevated. ||69|| He also thought, "Look, what a shameful act our elder brother has done for this fleeting kingdom." ||70|| "This kingdom is full of sorrow in its fruits, and it is fleeting, so it is to be condemned. It is like a woman who commits adultery, for just as an adulterous woman leaves one husband for another, so too does this kingdom leave one king for another. This kingdom abandons its people, but foolish beings do not abandon it. This is a matter of sorrow." ||71|| "Alas, those who are attached to worldly pleasures never think about the blameworthiness, harm, fleeting nature, and dullness of these pleasures." ||72|| "Who is the wise man who would desire these terrible worldly pleasures, which ensnare beings and lead them to a chain of suffering?" ||73|| "It is better to take poison, for it kills a being in one life, or perhaps it does not kill at all. But worldly pleasures are not good, for they kill beings countless times again and again." ||74|| "These worldly pleasures, which seem pleasant at the beginning, are bitter in their fruits. For their sake, a wise man does not go to the path of suffering." ||75||

However, because they were inviolable, he circumambulated them and, losing his radiance, stayed near them. 

**Meaning:** Weapons brought by the gods are not successful against those who are inviolable. Bahubali was the brother of Bharateshwara, born of the same father, so the chakra of Bharata was not successful against Bahubali. Its radiance faded, and he circumambulated Bahubali and stayed near him. ||66|| At that time, the great kings rebuked the Chakravarti and said with sorrow, "Enough, enough. Let this arrogance remain." Hearing this, the Chakravarti was filled with even greater sorrow. ||67|| "You have shown great valor," said Bahubali in a loud voice, weighing the chakra in his hands and then taking it off his shoulder and placing it on the ground. (Or, if we divide the verse as "Dhiro anikrishtam," then he placed it on a high platform.) ||68|| Many good kings came near and honored Maharaja Bahubali, praising his victory. At that time, Bahubali felt himself elevated. ||69||

**From the beginning to the end, these objects are destructive of life. Who, being wise, would enjoy these objects, which are like poisonous fruits?** || 76 ||

**Neither the blow of a weapon, nor blazing fire, nor thunderbolt, nor lightning, nor great serpents, are as disturbing to men as these objects, which are like poison.** || 77 ||

**Those who desire enjoyment, go to great oceans, fierce battles, terrible forests, rivers, and mountains, in the hope of gaining wealth.** || 78 ||

**Those who desire objects, wander in the ocean, disturbed by the loud, harsh sounds produced by the blows of the long arms of the aquatic creatures.** || 79 ||

**Those who are enticed by enjoyment, enter the battlefield, where the sky is filled with a shower of arrows, without fear.** || 80 ||

**Foolish men, afflicted by the hope of enjoyment, wander in those terrible forests, where even the forest dwellers move with fear in their eyes.** || 81 ||

**How unfortunate it is that many people, bound by the adverse planets of objects, desire to cross rivers, which are full of whirlpools, terrible and full of crocodiles.** || 82 ||

**Deceived by the deceitful teachings of those who claim to know the science of alchemy and the essence of things, many men climb even the most difficult mountains.** || 83 ||

**This old age, like an evil woman, embraces forcefully, seizing the hair with violence, under the pretext of applying hair dye.** || 84 ||

**He who is very eager for enjoyment, does not know what is beneficial and what is harmful. What is the difference between a man who is consumed by old age and a dead man?** || 85 ||

**The fall of old age is painful for men, like a cold fever, which causes trembling in the limbs and forces one to fall to the ground.** || 86 || 

Page #226:

The Adipurana, an Anga scripture, speaks of the mind's delusion, the stammering of speech, and the swift arrival of old age and intoxication in the body. ||87|| Just as a wicked elephant uproots a strong pillar, so too does time, the wicked elephant, forcibly uproot the life-pillar of humans. ||88|| This bodily strength is as fickle as an elephant's ear, and this dilapidated hut of a body is destroyed by the mice of disease. ||89|| Even though all this, including the kingdom, is impermanent, Bharat, whose consciousness is clouded by delusion, considers it eternal. How sorrowful! ||90|| Thus, contemplating the inferiority of his elder brother for a long time, Bahubali addressed Bharat with harsh words, saying: ||91|| "O king of kings, for a moment, abandon your shame and listen. You have been deluded and have taken refuge in this great and impossible feat." ||92|| "You have aimed your chakra at my body, which is like an impenetrable mountain. Know for sure that your chakra is as useless as a thunderbolt falling on a mountain made of diamonds." ||93|| "Furthermore, you have gained a great deal of dharma and fame by breaking the vessels of your brothers and desiring the kingdom." ||94|| "You have also established your praise by saying that Chakravarti Bharat was the eldest son of the Adi-Brahma, Lord Rishabhadeva, and that he was the savior of his lineage." ||95|| "O Bharat, you consider this kingdom, which you have conquered and which is filled with sin, to be yours alone and indestructible." ||96|| "May this kingdom, which you have honored, remain yours, O Ayushman. It is no longer worthy of me, for bondage is not for the joy of the virtuous." ||97|| 

Page #227:
---------------------------
Although your wealth is fruitful, it is tainted by many thorns - misfortunes. Who, in their right mind, would touch a thorny vine with their hand?  ||9||

We desire to bring under our control the thornless wealth of tapasya, therefore this worldly wealth is completely to be abandoned for us, like a cluster of poisonous thorns. ||19||

Please forgive me for this offense I have committed. I have fallen from humility, meaning I did not show you proper respect. I consider this my own fickleness. ||100||

Just as the roar of a cloud, emerging from the rain, brings joy to the hearts of those who are parched, so too did the words of the great king Bahubali, emerging from his mouth, bring some joy to the troubled heart of the Chakravarti Bharat. ||101||

"Alas, I have done a terrible deed!" Thus, the Chakravarti, blaming himself loudly, was greatly tormented by his own sinful karma. ||102||

Having used many forms of persuasion and supplication, the wise Bahubali, repeatedly pacifying the last of the Kulakaras, the great king Bharat, did not retreat from his resolve. This is fitting, for the steadfastness of the strong is indeed wondrous. ||103||

He entrusted the kingdom to his son, the mighty Mahabali, and himself, worshipping the feet of his Guru, took Jain initiation. ||104||

Embraced by the vine of initiation, having shed all possessions, he shone like a tree, withered by the shedding of its leaves. ||105||

Following the Guru's command, skilled in the study of scriptures and having adopted a single-minded focus, the self-controlled Bahubali observed the pratima yoga for a year, meaning he remained standing in one place, on one seat. ||106||

With praiseworthy vows, never eating, and with the area around him filled with forest vines, he was terrifying, emerging from the holes of termite mounds. ||107||

Surrounded on all sides by the leaping and jumping of hissing serpent young, whose fangs were visible, he shone, like a cluster of poisonous shoots. ||108||

21.1.  There was no obstacle for him created by women, nor any aversion, nor weariness of life. Seeing the female body as impure, like a leather doll, he endured the obstacle of women. ||119||

He remained standing, and did not desire, even in his mind, footwear, sitting, or lying down. Thus, he conquered the obstacles of standing, sitting, and lying down with ease. ||120||

The best among those who know the ultimate truth, he endured death and reproach, being indifferent to the body, which is to be abandoned, and not rejoicing in it. ||121||

"He did not desire to maintain his body through food obtained by begging. Therefore, he became silent and endured the obstacle of begging. ||122||

He endured the obstacles of sweat, excrement, and the touch of grass, being incapable of being disturbed. He had abandoned the conditioning of the body, and was indifferent to both pleasure and pain." ||123||

Considering the body as the abode of disease, the valiant and wise hero endured the obstacle of disease, which was difficult to bear. ||124||

Abandoning the pride born of knowledge, the wise one endured the obstacle of knowledge, knowing that the excellence of knowledge lies in becoming omniscient. He was fearless and courageous. ||125||

He was never eager for honor or reward. He did not rejoice when honored, nor was he satisfied when rewarded. ||126||

He was always content and conquered the obstacle of loss. The obstacles of ignorance and lack of vision did not affect this yogi. ||127||

A man who does not desire anything is not affected by the obstacles of attraction and aversion. ||118||

The great destruction of karmas occurred due to the conquest of the Pariṣahas. The conquest of the Pariṣahas is the supreme means of destroying karmas. ||128|| He conquered anger by forbearance, pride by renunciation of arrogance, deceit by straightforwardness, and greed by contentment. ||129|| He, the conqueror of Manmatha (Cupid), conquered the five senses effortlessly. Austerity is the pacification of the fire of desire, which is fueled by objects. ||130|| He destroyed the notions of food, fear, sexual intercourse, and possessions by conquering desire. ||131|| Thus, repeatedly destroying the spread of internal enemies, the self-knowing Muni, who knew all things, conquered his own self by his own self. ||132|| The five great vows, the five Samitis, the restraint of the five senses, the renunciation of clothes, the plucking of hair, the non-obstruction of the six necessities, the absence of bathing, sleeping on the ground, the absence of tooth-brushing, eating while standing, and taking food only once a day - these are called the twenty-eight root virtues. Besides these, there are eighty-four lakh (8.4 million) other virtues. The great Muni strived to practice all of them. ||133-135|| Relying on the supreme purity of vows, without abandoning any of them, that Muni, like the sun shining with radiant rays, was shining with the radiant rays of austerity. ||136|| Freed from the three kinds of pride (pride in taste, sound, and wealth), he attained supreme purity. He became firmly established in the path of liberation by the ten virtues of Dharma. ||137|| Relying on the three-fold protection (protection of the body, speech, and mind), the Muni, who was like a warrior of knowledge, was adorned with the five Samitis and he desired to conquer. ||138||

The thirty-sixth chapter: Their wealth of the three jewels was not stolen by the thief of passions, because they were always awake and never negligent. (13) They were always silent, so they never had any regard for idle talk. Their mind-fortress was well-guarded, so it could not be breached by the senses. (14) In their mind-palace, the lamp of knowledge shone brightly, so all things were worthy of contemplation. (141) They contemplated the essence of all things through their knowledge of right understanding and scripture, so the world became as clear to them as a berry in the palm of their hand. (142) They were radiant with the victory of endurance, having conquered their enemies, the senses. They pierced through the enemies of passions and experienced the kingdom of austerity. (143) Due to the power of their austerity, many yogic powers manifested in them, giving them the power to shake the three worlds. (144) Their four types of knowledge increased due to the destruction and pacification of the karmas that obscured them. (145) The increase of their knowledge of right understanding and scripture led to the manifestation of their powers of knowledge of the inner self and others, and their knowledge of scripture expanded to include the knowledge of all limbs and the past. (146) They transcended the highest level of knowledge and attained all levels of knowledge. They attained vast knowledge of the mind-sphere. (147) The purity of their knowledge led to a great increase in the purity of their austerity. Just as the root is the cause of the growth of a large tree, so knowledge is the cause of the growth of austerity. (148)

"He, who performs intense austerities, renouncing all Vikriya (transformations)." ||162|| He had the proximity of the world, who had attained the eight types of Aushadha (medicinal) powers, and who benefited the beings through Amarsha, Shwel, and Jalla. ||163|| Even though he did not eat, he had the Rasa (essence) power, due to his mere strength, and his Bala (strength) power, which manifested due to the power of his austerities, was also expanding. ||164|| He was Akshina Avastha (one who has no fatigue) and Akshina Mahanas (one who has no hunger), as the austerities, which are practiced with full devotion, produce inexhaustible fruits. ||165|| Having conquered the senses, he, the best of the yogis, who was a master of yoga, engaged his mind in the practice of meditation, knowing that the nature of the mind, free from duality, is the true self. ||166|| He attained the highest level of Kshama (forgiveness), Marda (gentleness), Arjava (straightforwardness), Satya (truthfulness), Shouch (purity), Tapas (austerity), Tyaga (renunciation), Akinchanya (non-attachment), and Brahmacharya (celibacy). ||167|| These are the ten thoughts of Dharma Dhyana (meditation on righteousness). Yogis believe that the highest Siddhi (perfection) - Moksha (liberation) - can be attained only when Yoga Siddhi (perfection in yoga) is achieved in this world. ||168||

The thirty-first (verse)
He contemplated the twelve thoughts of impermanence, homelessness, samsara, oneness, otherness, impurity, asoova, samvara, nirjara, loka, bodhi being difficult to attain, and dharma being difficult to explain, with a pure mind. ||159-160|| Contemplating the command, the transgression, the result, and the establishment, he held the dharma-dhyana, diminishing the fragments of karma. ||161|| Just as the fragments of collyrium are seen around a lit lamp, so too, the fragments of karma were seen to be destroyed for a moment around his dhyana-lamp. ||162|| His body's radiance, spreading in all directions, seemed to envelop the entire forest. ||163|| The deer and other animals, resting near his feet, were always confident, fearless, for even cruel animals like lions, etc., never harmed them, because they themselves became peaceful when they came there. ||164|| Even the enemies, like elephants, lions, etc., near his feet, abandoned their mutual enmity and moved about freely, thus indicating the muniraj's glory. ||165|| A lioness, smelling the head of a calf born to a buffalo, considered it her own child and fed it her milk. ||166|| Elephants, along with their leaders, were following behind lions, and the lion cubs, eager to suckle, were approaching the she-elephants. ||167|| The lion, touching the necks of the young elephants with his sharp claws, was making a sweet sound due to his youth, and the leaders of the elephants were very pleased with him, praising him. ||168|| The she-elephants, wanting to clean the ground around the muniraj's meditation seat, were bringing water in lotus leaf cups. ||169|| The elephants, lifting the lotuses with the tips of their trunks, placed them on his two feet, thus worshipping him. Oh,
—
The fragments of karma were seen, the forest was enveloped in the radiance of his body, like a blue gem

## Chapter Thirty-Six

**217** The Vidyadharis, who had come for the sake of play, sometimes removed the creepers that had grown over the entire body of the Muni. ||183||

Thus, the Muni, endowed with the strength of proper meditation and the power of penance, attained purity of the subtle body and turned towards the white meditation. ||184||

At the end of the year-long fast, Bharateshwar worshipped him. The great Muni, Bahubali, attained the supreme light, the imperishable knowledge of Kevala. ||185||

**Meaning:** Bahubali had observed a year-long fast during his initiation. On the day his fast ended, Bharat came and worshipped him. As soon as he worshipped, Bahubali attained the imperishable supreme knowledge of Kevala.

Bharateshwar thought, "I have caused him distress," and this thought remained in Bahubali's heart. Therefore, the knowledge of Kevala desired the worship of Bharat. ||186||

**Meaning:** As soon as Bharat worshipped, Bahubali's heart became peaceful, and at that very moment, he attained the knowledge of Kevala.

The king, Bharat, whose mind was filled with joy, performed the worship of the Muni, according to the proper rituals, both before and after the rise of the sun of Kevala knowledge. ||187||

The worship that Bharateshwar performed before the emergence of Kevala knowledge was to atone for his own offense, and the great worship he performed afterwards was to experience the emergence of Kevala knowledge. ||188||

Who can describe the great worship that Bharateshwar performed for his younger brother, Bahubali, who had attained the knowledge of Kevala? ||189||

Firstly, Bahubali was Bharat's younger brother. Secondly, Bharat had great love for Dharma. Thirdly, they both had a connection from many previous births. Fourthly, there was immense love between them. Each of these four factors alone is capable of increasing devotion. If all these factors come together, what good deed can they not accomplish? ||190-191||

The king, Bharateshwar, along with his ministers, the king's inner circle, and the royal priest, bowed down to the Muni, the lord of strength, with joy. ||192||

What more can be said about this? In short, he offered an arghya made of jewels, a stream of Ganga water, lamps of jewel light, akshata made of pearls, a naivedya of ambrosia, incense made of pieces of the Kalpavriksha, and a flower offering of a collection of flowers from the Parijata and other divine trees. He offered all the treasures, including jewels, in place of fruits. Thus, he performed a jewel-like puja. 
[193-195]
Indra and the other gods, who were aware of the arising of the Kevala Jnana of the Bahubali, came and performed his excellent puja, their seats trembling. [196]
At that time, the fragrant wind, skilled at moving the trees of the heavenly garden and taking away the drops of the Ganga river, was blowing gently. [197]
The drums of the gods were resounding deeply in the sky, and a collection of flowers born from the Kalpavriksha was falling in the sky. [198]
Above him, a canopy of jewels, made by divine artisans, was shining, and below, a divine throne made of precious gems was resplendent. [199]
On both sides of him, a collection of chamaras was swaying high, and a Gandhakuți, a place worthy of him, whose glory is renowned, was built for him. [200]
Thus, the Yogi-raja, who is worshipped by the gods and who has attained the Kevala Jnana, was adorned, surrounded by many munis, like the moon surrounded by stars. [201]
The Bhagavan Bahubali, who bears the state of the Arhant, born from the destruction of karmas, and who is therefore worshipped by the gods, wandered throughout the earth. [202]
Thus, the Bahubali, who knows all things, satisfied the entire world with his words, like ambrosia, and, purified by the proximity of his revered father, Bhagavan Rishabhadeva, reached Mount Kailasa. [203]

May Bahubali, who in the assembly of all kings, conquered all the glory of Bharata through eye-battles, wrestling matches, and water battles; who, considering the burden of the kingdom as insignificant as grass, renounced the world for liberation and became the foremost among those who had renounced their bodies; may he protect you all. ||204||

May Bahubali, who, in the presence of all the Kshatriyas, was approached by the victory-goddess of Bharata in the form of a blazing wheel, but who, having rejected her forever, made her an object of shame, and who had accepted the path of his father (the path of the monks), may he protect you all. ||205||

May he, the son of Adityanatha, who, in the presence of the kings, was holding the hope of the union with the victorious goddess, who was the most radiant, whose fame spread throughout the world, and who had undertaken austerities for true glory, always be victorious. ||206||

May Bahubali, whose strength of arms became famous in the wrestling match with the king of Bharata in the presence of the Kshatriyas, and whose name, when remembered, purifies the whole group of beings, always be victorious. ||207||

May Bahubali, whose feet, when touched, extinguish the fire of poison that comes out of the breath of serpents, who is respected by all the worlds, and whose body is adorned with creepers that are removed by the celestial nymphs with their hands, always be victorious. ||208||

The victorious Bharateshwara, having conquered all directions, entered the city of Saketa with great splendor. [1]

There, the great kings performed his coronation with joy, saying, "May your victory-born Lakshmi increase and become renowned throughout the world." [2]

The citizens, along with the palace priests, performed his coronation, saying, "May you, O Lord, be long-lived and rule the earth." [3]

During the coronation, the kings performed all the rituals, like collecting water from sacred places, as was done during the coronation of the great Vrishabhadeva. [4]

"Thus, the king was coronated with the same rituals and adorned with the same ornaments. The same victory cries were raised by the warrior kings. The same respect was shown to all the kings, along with their families, and they were made fearless. The same way, the people were satisfied with great wealth and gifts. The same great auspicious drums, whose sounds had silenced the roar of the ocean, were played. The same joyous great drums were played repeatedly. The same musical rituals were begun in the pleasure pavilion. The same radiance that was seen on Vrishabhadeva, who was coronated by the Indras on Mount Meru, was seen on Bharateshwara, who was coronated by the kings. The goddesses Ganga and Sindhu, the presiding deities of the rivers Ganga and Sindhu, came and performed his coronation with sacred water, filled with jewels and grains. The king, having been coronated, sat on the royal throne." [5-10]

The many celestial beings, adorned with their jeweled crowns, bowed down to him. [11]

The gods, including Himavat, the lord of the Himalayas, Vijayardha, and Magadha, as well as the celestial beings of both the northern and southern ranks, bowed their heads in reverence. ||12|| Even though he was crowned by the best of kings, he did not become arrogant, for the minds of great men are not touched by pride. ||13|| Even though he was fanned with a chamara, he did not find contentment, for he was constantly regretting that he had not shared his glory with his brothers. ||14|| His brilliance was not diminished by the conflict with his brother Bahubali, but rather, like gold that has been rubbed on a touchstone, it became even more intense. ||15|| Having obtained a kingdom free from thorns, King Bharata shone like the sun, his power increasing and his sphere pure. ||16|| His subjects, under the rule of this excellent king, enjoyed peace and prosperity, knowing that they were protected and receiving both yoga (the attainment of the unattainable) and kshema (the preservation of the attained). ||17|| King Bharata distributed the treasures according to their merit and enjoyed them, for self-enjoyment and distribution to others are the two main fruits of earning wealth. ||18|| The lord of treasures, Bharata, enjoyed the jewels as he wished, for true jewels are those that are useful. ||19|| This is the sixteenth Manu, the first of the chakravartis, the lord of the six continents, the king of kings, the supreme ruler, and the emperor. Thus, his glory is proclaimed. ||20|| This Bharata is the son of Lord Rishabhadeva and his mother had a hundred sons. Thus, his imperishable, radiant fame pervades the sky and the earth. ||21|| How large was his family and how great was his wealth? To answer this question of King Shrenik, Gautam Swami began to describe his wealth. ||22|| King Bharata, whose cheeks were dripping with the nectar of pride, had eighty-four thousand elephants, adorned with beautiful tusks and yoked with chariots. ||23||

There were as many chariots made of divine gems, as many as eighty-four lakhs, whose speed was like that of the mind and wind, and whose swiftness rivaled that of the sun. ||24|| There were eighteen crore horses, whose hooves were washed with the sacred waters of the three paths, and who could traverse the earth, water, and sky with equal ease. ||25|| There were eighty-four crore foot soldiers, whose valor was renowned in the crushing of many enemies. ||26|| The body of the Lord was bound with vajra bones, encircled by vajra rings, and pierced with vajra arrows, yet it was impenetrable. ||27|| His body was square, with perfectly proportioned limbs, and was extremely beautiful due to its original structure. ||28|| His body, which was like molten gold and possessed sixty-four auspicious marks, was adorned with various ornaments, enhancing its natural beauty. ||29|| The strength of the Lord was greater than the combined strength of the six-continent kings. ||30|| His rule, symbolized by the wheel, was unstoppable and extended to the limits of the ocean. It was borne on the heads of the kings of the earth, who were renowned for their valor. ||31|| There were thirty-two thousand crowned kings, who adorned the Lord like Mount Meru surrounded by mountain ranges. ||32|| There were as many countries, well-populated and prosperous, which adorned the vast territory of the Chakravarti. ||33|| There were as many queens, all of noble birth and lineage, whose beauty and radiance were like pure gold. ||34|| There were also thirty-two thousand beloved wives, given by Mlechcha kings and others, who had brought down the stories of the Apsaras to the earth. ||35|| There were as many beautiful women, with delicate bodies, whose captivating glances, like arrows of Kamadeva, had conquered the world. ||36||

**237** These were the fruits of the **Punyakalpataru** (Tree of Merit) for the **Chakravarti** (Universal Monarch), which were not enjoyed by anyone else and were unparalleled in the world. **16**

Without merit, how can one obtain such unparalleled beauty and wealth? Without merit, how can one obtain such an impenetrable body? **19**

Without merit, how can one obtain such an abundance of wealth and jewels? Without merit, how can one obtain such a family of elephants, horses, etc.? **192**

Without merit, how can one obtain such a power that even the gods bow down to? Without merit, how can one obtain such an endeavor that crosses the ocean? **195**

There were delicious dishes called **Amritakalp** (Ambrosia-like) which were prepared with spices and other ingredients, and a divine drink called **Amrit** (Ambrosia) which was as sweet as nectar. **189**

All these enjoyments and possessions of the **Chakravarti** were the fruits of his **Punyakalpataru** (Tree of Merit), which could not be enjoyed by anyone else and were unmatched in the world. **190**

Adipurana
This victorious one, who has manifested wealth, who has conquered all the kings, and who continuously expands his six-part kingdom, the Lakshmi of his vast empire, free from the control of others. For him, time, though vast, passed like a moment, due to the enjoyment of the six seasons, born from the rise of virtuous deeds, which were full of delight and extremely sweet. ||201||
He, who, by the weight of his wealth, adorned with countless jewels, treasures, and lands, made this entire empire Lakshmi, fit only for his own enjoyment, and protected it. He, who, like a king protecting his queen, never became anxious, this Chakravarti Bharat, ruled this earth, under one umbrella, for a long time. ||202||
The earth, adorned with six parts, became known as Bharatavarsha by his name. He protected this land, from the southern sea to the Himalayas, destroying his enemies. He, whose chest was the resting place of Lakshmi, worthy of his immeasurable wealth of jewels and treasures, that glorious Bharat, the lord of the earth, was the foremost and chief among the lords of treasures. ||203||
He, who is worthy of being praised by the beings of the three worlds, but who does not praise anyone himself. He, who is meditated upon by yogis, but who does not meditate on anyone himself. He, who is capable of elevating those who bow to him, but who himself stands in a position where he is not worthy of being bowed to, that is, he does not bow to anyone. That glorious one, the guru of the three worlds, the pure, divine Purusha, is victorious. ||204||

Page #257:
---------------------------
The thirty-seventh chapter, which having bowed to, one does not bow to another, having praised, one does not praise another, the auspicious ones, having taken refuge in, do not take refuge in another for the sake of welfare, and the wise ones, having honored, do not honor another. That glorious Vrishabha Jina, the Tirthankara, may protect us from the fear of the world. ||205||
Thus ends the thirty-seventh chapter, named "Description of the Glory of Bharateshwara", in the Triṣaṣṭiśalākāpuruṣacaritra, a collection of the Mahāpurāṇa, composed by the venerable Jinaseṇācārya, known as Ārṣa.
Vrishabhadeva may always be victorious. ||204||
1. From the fear of the world.

## The Thirty-Eighth Chapter

May the beautiful words of the Arhats, which have conquered all paths of speech, which have dispelled the darkness of ignorance, and which shine like the rays of the sun, be victorious forever! ||1||

May the Lord Vrishabhadeva, whose knowledge, like the Garuda Vidya, has awakened this world, which was asleep in the poison of delusion, be victorious forever! ||2||

Gautama Swami says to King Shrenik, "O Shrenik, I bow to the Supreme Light, Lord Vrishabhadeva, and Lord Mahavira. Now, listen as I speak of the origin of the twice-born." ||3||

Bharata Chakravarti, having conquered the land of Bharatavarsha along with many kings, returned from his conquest after sixty thousand years. ||4||

Having accomplished all his tasks, a thought arose in his mind: "How can this wealth of mine be used for the benefit of others?" ||5||

"Should I perform a great sacrifice called 'Mahamaham' in honor of the Jina, and by distributing wealth, satisfy the entire world?" ||6||

"The monks, always free from desire, do not accept wealth from us. But which householder is worthy of being honored with wealth, grain, and other riches?" ||7||

"Those who observe the Anuvrata, who are wise and valiant, and who are the leaders among householders, are worthy of being honored by us with desired wealth and vehicles." ||8||

Thus, having decided to test those worthy of honor, the King of Kings, Bharata, summoned all the kings at that time. ||9||

He sent word to everyone, "Come to our festival today, each with your own righteous friends, servants, and attendants." ||10||

Meanwhile, the Chakravarti had his courtyard filled with green sprouts, flowers, and fruits for the purpose of testing them. ||11||

Those who did not observe the vows, either out of thought or restriction, did not enter the king's palace. The king, from various sources, summoned the rest. ||12|| 

Page #259:
---------------------------
The Thirty-Eighth Chapter

241. Those who were born in great families and were striving for the perfection of their vows, did not wish to enter the palace as long as there were green sprouts on the path. ||13||

242. Out of compassion, some, fearing sin, turned back without crossing the king's courtyard, which was strewn with green grains. ||14||

243. When the Chakravarti insisted, they crossed the king's courtyard by another, more suitable path, and reached him. ||15||

244. "Why did you not come before, and why have you come now?" When the Chakravarti asked them this, they replied as follows: ||16||

245. "On this festival day, it is not permissible to break off buds, leaves, and flowers, and those who do so destroy the lives of the creatures born in them, who are non-violent. ||17||

246. "O Dev, we have heard from the omniscient Dev that there are countless Nigoda Jivas in green sprouts and other things. ||18||

247. "Therefore, we have not crossed your courtyard today, which is adorned with wet fruits, flowers, and sprouts." ||19||

248. Impressed by their words, the wealthy Bharat praised all those who were steadfast in their vows and honored them with gifts, respect, and other forms of respect. ||20||

249. He marked them all with threads from the Padma treasure, which are called Brahma Sutras, from one to eleven. ||21||

250. Bharat honored all those who had taken the Yajnopavita according to the distinctions made by the images, and allowed those who were not vow-takers to go their way. ||22||

251. Then, those who had been honored by the Chakravarti became even more steadfast in their vows, and other people also began to worship them. ||23||

252. Bharat taught them, through the Upasaka-Adhyayana-Anga, about Ijya, Varta, Datti, Swadhyaya, Samyama, and Tapa. ||24||

---------------------------
## Adipurana: Description of Kuladharma and Arhat Puja

This is their Kuladharma, thus the description of their worship, etc. Then, King-Sage Bharata described it in order. || 25 ||

The worthiness of worship, the Ijya, is said to be of four types: Sadarchana, Chaturmukha, Kalpadruma, and Ashta. || 26 ||

Among these four types of worship, the daily worship, called Nityamaha, is performed by taking incense, flowers, akshata, etc., from one's own home and offering them to the Jinalaya. || 27 ||

Or, the construction of the image of the Arhatdeva and the temple with devotion, and the giving of a village, field, etc., by writing a donation deed, is also called Sadarchana (Nityamaha). || 28 ||

Besides this, the worship of the great Munis, which is performed while giving daily donations according to one's capacity, should also be considered Nityamaha. || 29 ||

The great sacrifice performed by kings adorned with great crowns is to be known as the Chaturmukha sacrifice. Its other name is Sarvatobhadra. || 30 ||

The sacrifice performed by emperors by giving whatever is desired (Kimichcha) as a donation, and which fulfills all desires, is called the Kalpadruma sacrifice. Like the Kalpavriksha, it fulfills all desires. This sacrifice can only be performed by emperors. || 31 ||

The fourth is the Ashtahnika sacrifice, which is performed by all people and is very famous in the world. Besides this, there is also an Indra-dhvaja sacrifice, which Indra used to perform. || 32 ||

Offering Bali (food offerings), performing abhisheka (ceremonial bath), worship during the three Sandhyas (dawn, noon, and dusk), and other similar types of worship are all included in these categories. || 33 ||

The great worship of the Jinesvara performed according to this method is called Ijya by the knowers of the Dharma, and it is the first Vritti (practice). || 34 ||

Performing agriculture, etc., with pure conduct is called Varta, and Dayadatti, Patradatti, Samadatti, and Anvayadatti are the four types of Datti (giving). || 35 ||

The wise consider Dayadatti to be the giving of compassion to the group of beings who are worthy of grace, with the purity of mind, speech, and body, and the removal of their fear. || 36 ||

For the great tapasvi Munis, the giving of food, etc., with the acceptance of worship as the first step, is considered Patradana. || 37 || 

Page #261:
---------------------------
The thirty-eighth chapter:

Giving to one who is like oneself, who is a guide across the ocean of existence, who is a householder, and who is endowed with rituals, mantras, and vows, is called *patra-dana* (gift to a worthy recipient).  Giving earth, gold, etc., to such a person, or giving to a person of moderate worth with equal understanding and faith, is called *samana-datti* (equal giving).  Giving one's entire family, including all wealth and the entire lineage, to one's son for the sake of establishing the lineage is called *sakala-datti* (total giving).  The study of scriptures is called *svadhyaya* (self-study), the practice of fasting, etc., is called *tapa* (austerity), and the observance of vows is called *samyama* (self-control).

These six types of pure conduct are to be practiced by the twice-born.  He who transgresses these is a fool, a twice-born in name only, not in quality.  Austerity, scriptural knowledge, and birth are the three causes of being a Brahmin.  He who is devoid of austerity and scriptural knowledge is a Brahmin only by birth.  The livelihood of these people is free from sin, therefore their birth is considered superior.  Because giving, worship, and study are the main activities, and because of the purity of their vows, their superior birth is even more refined.

Although the human race is one, born from the rise of the *karma* of birth, it has become fourfold due to the differences arising from livelihood.  Those who are refined by the practice of vows are called Brahmins, those who bear arms are called Kshatriyas, those who earn wealth justly are called Vaishyas, and those who rely on low livelihood are called Shudras.  Therefore, the refinement of the twice-born is considered to be through the practice of austerity and the study of scriptures.  He who is not refined by austerity and the study of scriptures is a twice-born only by birth.

He who is born twice, once from the womb and once from the ritual, is called a *dwijanma* (twice-born) or *dwij* (twice-born).  But he who is devoid of both ritual and mantra is merely a name-bearer.  Therefore, the great king, wishing to strengthen the refinement of these twice-born, spoke to them about all the different types of rituals.

After the Garbhaadhaan, in the third month, the Priti Kriya takes place, which should be performed by the dvijas with joy. ||77|| In this Kriya, as before, the worship of the Jineshwara should be performed with mantras, a toran should be tied at the door, and two full kumbhas should be established. ||78|| From that day onwards, the householders should have a bheri sound, accompanied by ghanta and dhwani, played according to their means. ||79||

This is the Priti Kriya. In the fifth month after the Garbhaadhaan, the Supriti Kriya takes place, which should be performed by the delighted, supreme Upasaka Vratas. ||80|| In this Kriya, the same procedure as before should be performed by those who know the mantras and rituals, in the presence of the Arhant Bhagwan's image, with Agni and the Devatas as witnesses. ||81||

This is the Supriti Kriya. The Dhriti Kriya should be performed in the seventh month by those who respect the Kriya, by the householders with undisturbed minds, for the growth of the fetus. ||82||

This is the Dhriti Kriya. In the ninth month, near the end, the Mod Kriya takes place, which should be performed by the respectful, excellent dvijas, for the nourishment of the fetus, in the same way as the previous Kriyas. ||83|| In this Kriya, the excellent dvijas should perform the Gatrikabandh on the pregnant woman's body, i.e., write bijaaksharas with mantras, adorn her with auspicious ornaments, and perform the ritual of tying a Raksha Sutra. ||84||

This is the Mod Kriya. After the birth, the Priyodhbhava Kriya takes place, which is also known as the Jatakarma Vidhi. This Kriya should be performed according to the rules, remembering the Jineshwara. ||85|| In this Kriya, the Avantaar Vishesh Karya, like the Kriya, Mantra, etc., are very important, so their complete knowledge should be obtained from the Moola Upasaka Sutra. ||86||

This is the Priyodhbhava Kriya. 

Page #265:

## The Thirty-Eighth Chapter

After twelve days from the birth, the **Namakarma** ceremony is performed on a day that is auspicious for the parents and the child, bringing happiness to them. ||87||  According to one's capacity, the **Arhant** Devas, the Rishis, and the Dwijas should be worshipped. A good name, conducive to the growth of the lineage, should be given to the child. ||88|| Alternatively, one should choose a good name from the collection of one thousand and eight names of the Jina Devas, using the **Ghatapatra** method. ||89||

This is the **Namakarma** ceremony. After this, the **Bahiryana** ceremony is performed two, three, or three to four months later, on an auspicious day, with the accompaniment of trumpets and other auspicious instruments, as per one's convenience. ||90|| From this day onwards, it is scripturally sanctioned to take the child, who is sitting in the lap of the mother or the wet nurse, out of the delivery room. ||91|| During this ceremony, whatever wealth is received as gifts from relatives and others should be collected and given to the child when he becomes eligible to inherit his father's wealth. ||92||

This is the eighth **Bahiryana** ceremony.

After this, the **Nishadiya** ceremony is performed on a bed spread with auspicious materials, suitable for the child. ||93|| In this ceremony, all the rituals, including the worship of the Siddhas, should be performed as before, so that the child may become increasingly eligible to sit on the divine seat. ||94||

This is the ninth **Nishadiya** ceremony.

**Adipurana**

After the completion of seven months, the feeding of food is prescribed, preceded by the rituals of worship. ||15||

Thus ends the Annaprasana (first feeding). Then, after the completion of one year, the Vyushti ceremony is performed, also known as Varshavardhana (annual growth) as per the scriptures. ||16||

Here too, as before, donations should be made, worship of the Jina should be performed, and the relatives should be invited and fed. ||17||

Thus ends the Vyushti.

The Keshavapa is the shaving of the hair on an auspicious day, preceded by the worship of the gods and the guru. ||9||

After applying fragrant water and other things, the remaining Akshata (unbroken rice grains) should be placed on the hair. The child's head should be shaved, either with a tuft of hair or according to the family tradition. The child should be bathed, anointed, and adorned with ornaments. After prostrating to the monks, the relatives should bless the child. ||10||

This ceremony is known as Chaula, and it is considered auspicious and brings merit. People participate in it with great joy. ||101||

Thus ends the Keshavapa.

Then, in the fifth year, the child should be introduced to the alphabet through the Lipisankhyana ceremony. ||102||

The rituals of worship should be performed according to one's means, and a learned householder who is a Vrati (observant of vows) should be appointed as the child's teacher. ||103||

Thus ends the Lipisankhyana.

The Upaniti (sacred thread ceremony) is performed in the eighth year after conception. This ceremony includes the shaving of the hair, the Vratabandhana (tying of the sacred thread), and the Maujibandhana (tying of the sacred thread). ||104||

The Thirty-eighth Chapter

242. The Maujibandhan of the one who has performed the Arhat Puja should be done in the Jinalaya, with the offering of vows in the presence of the Guru. ||105||

He who has a Shikha, wears white clothes, is free from adornment and vices, and wears the Yajnopavit thread as a sign of his vow, is called a Brahmachari at that time. ||106||

Other names can be given to him that are appropriate to his conduct. At that time, except for the royal prince, everyone should earn their livelihood through begging, and even the royal prince should go to the inner quarters and beg for alms from his mother, etc., in a vessel, because at that time this is the only way to beg. Whatever is obtained in alms, the first portion should be offered to Sri Arhatdeva, and the rest of the food should be eaten by himself. ||107-108||

This is the fourteenth Upaneti Kriya. _ Now, the description of the Kriya called Vratacharya of this Brahmachari boy who is wearing the signs of the vow on his waist, thighs, chest, and head, is being given. ||109||

The sign on the waist is made by tying a rope of three strands of Munja grass, this Maujibandhan is a part of the purity of the three jewels and is a sign of the twice-born. ||110||

The sign on the thigh is a very clean white dhoti, that dhoti indicates that the lineage of the Arhat Bhagwan is pure and vast. ||111||

The sign on his chest is the Yajnopavit, tied with seven strands, this Yajnopavit is indicative of the seven supreme realms. ||112||

The sign on his head is a clean and excellent tonsure, which enhances the tonsure of his mind, speech, and body. Meaning - The mind, speech, and body remain pure by tonsure. ||113||

Generally, he should wear vows purified by such signs, vows like the vow of non-violence, etc., which are enhanced by Brahmacharya. ||114||

This Brahmachari should not use a twig for cleaning his teeth, nor should he eat betel nut, nor should he apply collyrium, nor should he bathe with turmeric, etc., he should only 1. With inner garments. 2. Free from adornment and vices. 3. Yajnopavit thread. 4. Suitable for wearing. 5. His name. 6. Royal prince. 7. Meaning, he should beg for alms in a vessel. 8. Alms food. 9. Offering the first portion to the Deva. 10. Eating the remaining food. 11. - I. 12. Brahmacharya vow. 13. White clothes. 14. Without a turban, etc. 15. In this way. 

Page #268:
---------------------------
## Chapter 250

The **Ādipurāṇa** states that a **Brahmacārī** should not sleep on a cot or bed, nor should he rub his body against another's. He should sleep alone on the ground to maintain the purity of his vows.  

He should observe this vow until he completes his studies. After that, he should observe the vows that are the foundation of householders. 

He should learn the **Śrāvakācāra** from the mouth of his Guru and then, with humility, study the **Ātma-śāstra**. 

He should also study **Śabda-vidyā** (grammar) and **Artha-śāstra** (logic) to awaken good qualities and attain scholarship. There is no fault in studying these subjects after acquiring knowledge of **Ācāra**. 

He should also study **Jyotiṣa-śāstra** (astrology), **Chanda-śāstra** (prosody), **Śakuna-śāstra** (omens), and **Saṅkhyā-śāstra** (mathematics) in particular. 

This is the fifteenth **Vrata-caryā** (practice of vows). 

After this, the **Brahmacārī** who has completed his studies undergoes the **Vrata-avtarana** (descent of vows). In this ceremony, he continues to observe the ordinary vows but abandons the special vows he had taken during his studies. 

After this ceremony, he takes the vows of **Madhu-tyāga** (abandonment of honey), **Māṁsa-tyāga** (abandonment of meat), **Pañcodumbara-varjana** (abandonment of five Udumbara fruits), and **Hiṁsādi-virati** (abandonment of the five types of violence). These vows are to be observed for life. 

This **Vrata-avtarana** ceremony should be performed after twelve or sixteen years, with the Guru as a witness and with the worship of **Jineśvara**. 

It is appropriate to honor the **Dvijas** (twice-born) first and then perform the **Vrata-avtarana**. After the ceremony, it is appropriate to accept clothes, ornaments, and garlands with the permission of the Guru. 

If he is a **Kṣatriya** (warrior), he can wear weapons for the protection of his livelihood or for adornment. 

In this way, although he descends from the **Bhoga-brahma-vrata** (vow of abstaining from sensual pleasures), he still observes the **Kāma-brahma-vrata** (vow of abstaining from sexual desire) until he is married. 

This is the **Vrata-avtarana**. 

One should take a purifying bath in water.

Having instructed him in this way, one should engage him in the acquisition of a profession. He, along with his wife, should be capable of performing these duties.

**Chapter 142:**

This is the eighteenth action of acquiring a profession. The conduct of a family, for one who has acquired a profession, is described next. It has been previously explained, characterized by learning, wealth, and livelihood.

**Chapter 143:**

A pure livelihood and the performance of the six duties of an Arya are the conduct of a family. This is also considered the family dharma of householders.

**Chapter 144:**

This is the nineteenth action of family conduct. Having attained family conduct, he, upholding steadfastness in dharma, should accept the role of a householder's teacher, becoming the master of householders.

**Chapter 145:**

Then, recognizing him as a person of the highest caste, one should establish him as the master of the household, through auspicious livelihood, actions, mantras, marriage, and subsequent actions.

**Chapter 146:**

Through these unique actions, such as learning and virtuous conduct, he, elevating himself, becomes worthy of being the master of the household.

**Chapter 147:**

At that time, he should be honored with titles like "highest caste," "great god," "well-learned," "best among the twice-born," "liberator," "village head," and "worthy of respect."

**Chapter 148:**

This is the twentieth action of becoming the master of the household. Then, having obtained a son capable of bearing his burden, he, having established his household, should reside peacefully.

## The Thirty-Eighth Chapter

**253**  The practice of constant self-study, detachment from worldly desires, and various types of fasting are the characteristics of a peaceful life. ||149||

This is the twenty-first practice of peace.  Having considered himself fulfilled in the householder's life, when he is ready to renounce his home, this is the procedure for him. ||150||

He should first worship the Siddhas, invite all his loved ones, and in their presence, entrust everything to his son and then renounce his home. ||151||

Calling his eldest son, he should say, "Son, the lineage of our family is yours to uphold. I have divided my wealth into three parts. You should use one part for religious activities, keep another for your household expenses, and divide the third among your siblings.  Daughters should receive an equal share as sons.  Being the eldest, you should take care of all our descendants.  You are knowledgeable in scriptures, conduct, actions, mantras, and rituals.  Therefore, without laziness, worship the Guru and the Gods, and uphold the family tradition." ||152-154||

Having instructed his eldest son in this way, the renunciant, free from worry, should leave his home to receive initiation. ||155-156||

This is the twenty-second practice of renouncing the home.  For a renunciant who has abandoned his possessions, who has attained right vision, who is peaceful, and who is the master of his household, the actions or practices performed before receiving initiation, while wearing a single garment, are called the "pre-initiation practices" of a renunciant. ||157-158||

This is the twenty-third practice of pre-initiation.  For a person who has renounced all possessions and desires to receive Jain initiation, the act of adopting the naked form is called "Jinarupata" (the state of being like a Jina). ||159||

**Notes:**

1.  " निष्प्रभः " -  This word is not translated as it is a Jain term referring to a person who has renounced all worldly possessions.

##  Translation:

**254**

It is difficult for those with timid souls to bear the form of the Jina (Digambara form). This form of the Jina, characterized by the renunciation of possessions, is only borne by those who are courageous and steadfast. ||160||

This is the twenty-fourth Jina form.

One who has taken initiation and observed a fast, and who is engaged in the process of parana (taking food according to the prescribed rules), should engage in the practice of **Mounadhyayanavruttatva** (silent study of scriptures). ||161||

One who has taken the vow of silence, whose soul is filled with humility, and whose mind, speech, and body are pure, should study the entire scriptures from the beginning in the presence of the Guru. ||162||

For scriptures, which are worshipped by the worthy souls through this method, enhance their capabilities in this world and bring them happiness in the next. ||163||

This is the twenty-fifth **Mounadhyayanavruttatva**.

Thereafter, one who has studied all the scriptures of conduct and has gained extensive knowledge of all the scriptures through the study of other scriptures, and whose conduct is pure, should practice the **Tirthakrudbhavana** (meditation on the qualities of a Tirthankara). ||164||

These meditations are considered to be sixteen in number, which are characterized by the purity of right faith, etc., and which bestow great prosperity, as described earlier. ||165||

This is the twenty-sixth **Tirthakrudbhavana**.

Thereafter, one who has mastered all knowledge and has conquered his inner self, should, with the grace of the Guru, accept the position of the Guru. ||166||

One who is endowed with knowledge and wisdom, who is dear to his Guru, i.e., whom the Guru considers worthy of receiving his position, who is humble and righteous, is worthy of receiving the position of the Guru. ||167||

This is the twenty-seventh **Guruasthanabhyupagam** (acceptance of the Guru's position).

Thereafter, one who is virtuous and righteous should engage in the **Ganapoushan** (nourishment of the Sangha). The acceptance of the Sangha is called **Ganopgrahan** by the great sages. ||168||

1. Until the completion of the scriptures.
2. Silent.
3. Should study.
4. -Knowledge of the scriptures, knowledge of the world, knowledge of the self.
5. Knowledge of liberation scriptures. Wisdom of the arts and crafts.
6. Of good conduct.

## The Thirty-Eighth Chapter: The Nourishment of the Sangha

The Shravakas, Aryikas, Shravakas, and Shravikas, even though they are restrained, should be guided on the right path. The Acharya should nourish the Sangha. ||169||

He should give the scriptures to those who seek them, and initiation to those who seek it. He should constantly teach the true Dharma to those who seek it. ||170||

He should encourage those who follow the right conduct, and deter those who follow the wrong conduct. He should purify himself from the impurities of his past actions and protect the Sangha. ||171||

This is the Thirty-Eighth Chapter: The Nourishment of the Sangha.

## The Thirty-Ninth Chapter: Obtaining the Guru's Position

The Acharya, who nourishes the Sangha in this way, should strive to obtain the position of his Guru. ||172||

He should call upon a worthy disciple who has studied all the scriptures and is respected by the great Munis, and entrust him with his responsibilities. ||173||

With the Guru's permission, the disciple should also occupy the Guru's position, follow all the Guru's conduct, and guide the entire Sangha. ||174||

This is the Thirty-Ninth Chapter: Obtaining the Guru's Position.

## The Fortieth Chapter: The Meditation of Non-Attachment

Having entrusted all his responsibilities to a worthy disciple, the Acharya, who is free from suffering, should live alone and meditate on the non-attachment of his soul. ||175||

He who lives with non-attachment, who lives alone, who is a great ascetic, and who desires only to purify his own soul, should not purify any other being. ||176||

He should abandon attachment to disciples, scriptures, and other things, and with a mind free from ego, he should strive for purity of conduct. ||177||

This is the Fortieth Chapter: The Meditation of Non-Attachment.

## The Forty-First Chapter: The Attainment of Nirvana

Having purified his soul in this way, he should then strive for Sallekhana. Having purified his soul and attained the Yoga of Nirvana, he should become one with the Supreme Soul. ||178|| 

Page #274:
---------------------------
The Adipurana states that the supreme penance, which is attained through yoga and meditation, is called Yoga Nirvana. This is achieved through intense effort and devotion. (176)

One should first purify the body and make it suitable for Sallekhana, then gradually weaken it by abstaining from food and other pleasures. (180)

Before taking the vow of renunciation, one should cultivate the thought of attaining the state of a "Bhavyatma" (a soul destined for liberation), abandoning all desires for life and fear of death. This is called Yoga Nirvana. (181)

One should renounce attachment and aversion, and abandon all doubts about attaining liberation. One should also give up the notion of "mine" with regard to things that are not the self. (182)

One should contemplate, "I am not the body, nor the mind, nor the speech, nor the cause of these three." One should not be troubled by these three and cultivate the thought of their distinctness. (183)

One should contemplate, "I am alone, I have no one, and I belong to no one." One should cultivate this thought of oneness with a generous heart. (184)

One should contemplate Yoga Nirvana, the state of eternal and infinite bliss, and focus on it with the mind, as if it were the highest goal in the world. This is how a yogi achieves Yoga Nirvana. (185)

This is the thirty-first stage of Yoga Nirvana.

After this, the yogi, renouncing all food and the body, should strive for the attainment of Yoga Nirvana. (186)

One who has developed a deep respect for the ultimate goal of liberation, who has renounced attachment to the body, and whose intellect is pure, should contemplate the mind, speech, and body as distinct from the self. (187)

One should focus the mind on the feet of the five supreme beings (Pancha Parameshthis) and dedicate oneself to the practice of Yoga Nirvana at the end of life. (188)

Yoga is the state of Samadhi (deep meditation), and Nirvana is the bliss that arises from it. Yoga Nirvana is the means to attain these desired states. (189)

This is the thirty-second stage of Yoga Nirvana. (190)

## Thirty-eighth Chapter

257.  Thus, having stabilized the yogas and having relinquished the life-force, the virtuous soul, moving forward, attains the Indra-upāpāda. ||19||

Indras are the lords of the gods, and birth among them is called Indra-upāpāda, which is attained through the power of austerities. This Indra-upāpāda is only for those who follow the path of the Arhat. ||191||

Then, in that very instant, he becomes fully youthful in the divine bed, and, radiant with divine brilliance, he is immersed in supreme bliss. ||192||

He is endowed with the eight extraordinary qualities, such as ānīma, etc., and is adorned with a divinely-born garment, a garland, and ornaments of gems. ||193||

Bearing the supreme influence born of divine power, he then, through the light of divine knowledge, becomes aware of his own being as an Indra. ||194||

Thus ends the Indra-upāpāda kriyā. This is sufficient to explain the awareness of one's birth. Then, the supreme gods perform the Indra-abhiṣeka for him. ||195||

With divine music, instruments, and auspicious chants, and with the beautiful dances of apsaras, his Indra-abhiṣeka is performed. He wears a radiant crown, the chief symbol of his kingdom, and is hailed by millions of gods who are filled with joy. He is adorned with a garland, a fine garment, and divine ornaments. Mounted on the Indra-viṣṭara, he is greatly honored. ||196-198||

Thus ends the Indra-abhiṣeka. Then, having bowed to those excellent gods, he, the Indra, proceeds to bestow boons, placing them in their respective positions. ||199||

Surrounded by gods who are pleased by the bestowal of their respective vimānas, he, the virtuous Indra, enjoys the divine pleasures for a long time. ||200||

Thus, this Indra-sukha-udaya, which is the bestowal of boons, is described as a two-fold kriyā, appropriate for the inhabitants of the heavenly realm. ||201||

Thus ends the Indra-sukha-udaya.

According to the above, the one who has stabilized the yogas, i.e., has made the mind, speech, and body steady, and who has relinquished the life-force, attains the Indra-upāpāda kriyā as he moves forward, following the virtuous path. ||190|| 

Page #276:
---------------------------
The Adipurana states that the Dropapada Abhisheka Dana and Sukhodaya are the ways to attain heaven. Now, I will describe another action, the Indra Tyaga. 

When Indra realizes that his lifespan is nearing its end, he instructs the devas: "Oh, devas, I have protected you for a long time. I have treated some of you like my own father, some like my sons, and raised them with love. I have appointed some as priests, ministers, and advisors. I have considered some as my friends and companions. I have entrusted some with the protection of my life, and appointed some to positions of honor to protect the devas. I have appointed some as commanders, some as family, some as commoners, some as servants, some as close associates, and some as guards within the palace. I have made some of the goddesses my beloveds, and some as great queens. In this way, I have shown you extraordinary love, and you have shown me extraordinary love in return."

Now, my desire for heavenly pleasures has waned, and the wealth of the earth is surely approaching me. Therefore, in the presence of all of you, I am relinquishing this entire heavenly kingdom. I dedicate all of it to the one who will succeed me as Indra.

Thus, Indra, feeling a sense of detachment towards the devas, instructs them and, being a wise and courageous soul, does not grieve at the relinquishment of the position of Indra. This is the action of Indra Tyaga, the relinquishment of heavenly pleasures. Wise people, without effort, abandon such desires. 

Page #277:

## The Thirty-Eighth Parva

The **Avataara Kriyaa** of the **Indra** then changes. Having become worthy, he descends from heaven at the end of his lifespan. || 214 ||

"Having attained human birth, this Indra, desiring **Siddhi** quickly, fixes his mind on the worship of the **Siddha**." || 215 ||

He is indicated by sixteen auspicious dreams. At that time, he attains the auspicious **Swarga Avataara Kriyaa**. || 216 ||

This is the **Indra Avataara**.

## The Thirty-Ninth Parva

Then, he descends into the womb, like a treasury of jewels, purified by the great Goddess, **Mahadevi**, and the **Sri** and other goddesses. || 217 ||

Six months before his birth, **Kubera** rains down jewels. This rain of jewels seems like the wealth of heaven descending upon the earth, along with the **Siddha**. || 218 ||

The **Amrita**-like, fragrant, gentle breeze blows, filling all directions. It seems like the breath of the earth-goddess, created by the **Vayu Kumaras**. || 219 ||

The deep sound of the **Dundubhi** drums, rising in the sky, creates a fear of untimely thunder in the peacocks. || 220 ||

The **Guhyaka** deities shower the **Amrita**-eaters with garlands of **Mandara** flowers, which never fade and attract bees with their fragrance. || 221 ||

The goddesses **Sri**, **Hri**, **Buddhi**, **Dhriti**, and **Kirti**, along with **Lakshmi**, come together and serve the mother of the universe, **Mahadevi**. || 222 ||

In a certain abode of good deeds, a holy place, the abode of a righteous king, the **Hiranyagarbha** takes birth, born of **Hiranyotkrista**. || 223 ||

He is known as **Hiranyotkrista** because of the auspiciousness indicated by the **Hiranya**. He, the possessor of three kinds of knowledge, even while in the womb, performs that **Kriyaa**. || 224 ||

This is the **Hiranya Janma**.

##  Translation:

**261**

**Adipurana**

"Vishveshwara, Jaganmata, Mahadevi, Mahasati, Pujya, and Sumangala, these are the names by which Jinambika is known." (225)

"Sri, Hri, Buddhi, Dhriti, Kirti, and Lakshmi, these six goddesses residing in the Kulachala are known as Jinamatrikas, the ones who serve the Jinamata." (226)

"After birth, the Indra, having arrived on the summit of Mount Meru, perform the abhisheka of the Lord with the pure water of the Kshirasagara. This is the Mandara abhisheka of the Parameshti. It is well-known, therefore, it is not elaborated upon here." (227-228)

This is the fortieth Mandara abhisheka.

"Then, the Lord, being independent and self-born, receives the teachings of Vidya. He attains the worship of the Guru without being a disciple, meaning he becomes the Guru of all without being anyone's disciple." (229)

"At that time, the Indras, filled with wonder, worship the Lord, the protector, the Guru of the three worlds, saying, 'You are worthy of being a God even though you are not taught.'" (230)

This is the forty-first Guru puja.

"Then, in his youth, he attains the position of Yuvaraja. At that time, the great and powerful Lord is crowned and anointed." (231)

This is the forty-second Yuvarajya.

"After that, the Lord is crowned as the Raja-adhiraja (Emperor) by all the kings. He rules the earth, extending to the ocean, without being ruled by anyone." (232)

This is the forty-third Swarajya.

"Then, he obtains the Chakra, upon receiving treasures and jewels. He is worshipped by his own people, saying, 'He is the king.'" (233)

This is the Chakra-labha.

**Meaning:**

"The birth of the Lord is marked by a shower of gold, signifying his extraordinary birth. This act of receiving the name Hiranyotkrista, meaning 'born of gold,' is significant." (224)

This is the thirty-ninth Hiranyotkrista-janma.

The **dishaṃjaya** is to be known as the effort to conquer the directions. He conquers the earth with the ocean, with the **chakra-ratna** in front. ||23||

Thus ends the **dishaṃjaya**. Now the **chakra-abhiṣeka** ceremony is described, which takes place when the **siddhā-digvijaya** enters his own city. ||235||

He enters his own abode, with the **chakra-ratna** in front. His palace is filled with great wealth and surpasses the celestial chariots. ||236||

He sits there for a moment in a beautiful pleasure pavilion, adorned with **chamaras**, resembling a mountain king with waterfalls. ||237||

He worships the treasures and celebrates the **chakra** festival. He gives gifts to those who desire them and honors the noble kings. ||238||

He wears a necklace, adorned with large pearls, shining like stars, resembling a festive archway. ||244||

All the people consider him the **rājadhirāja** and worship him with the anointment ceremony. ||245||

This is the forty-fourth ceremony called **chakra-lābha**.

After that, the **chakra-ratna** is placed in front of him, and he sets out to conquer the entire earth, including the ocean. This effort to conquer the directions is called **dishaṃjaya**. ||246||

This is the forty-fifth ceremony called **dishaṃjaya**.

When the **digvijaya** is complete and the Lord is about to enter his city, the **chakra-abhiṣeka** ceremony takes place. Now, this ceremony is described. ||247||

**Verse 245:**  His body, adorned with a shining Brahma Sutra, rises in height, resembling a mountain with waterfalls cascading down its slopes.

The Thirty-Eighth Chapter

263.  Always engaging them in meditation for the benefit of the people, and protecting their nature with respect, gifts, and trust. 257. You should protect the people who have submitted to you with justice. If you are inclined towards injustice, your livelihood will surely be lost. 258. Justice is of two kinds: the suppression of the wicked and the protection of the righteous. This is the eternal Dharma of the Kshatriyas, which should be protected by the rulers. 259. The deities of the divine weapons are also to be worshipped according to the scriptures. With their blessings, victory in battle is certain. 260.  You should diligently follow this royal duty, without sloth, and deal with the people justly. 261. He who protects this Dharma becomes victorious in Dharma, for the Kshatriya who has conquered his own self and lives by justice can conquer the earth. 262. By acting justly, one gains fame in this world, acquires great wealth and the earth, and attains liberation in the next world, and gradually conquers the three worlds. 263. Thus, the great kings repeatedly instruct these kings in the ways of protecting the people, and they themselves protect them with constant contemplation of Yoga and Kshema. 264. This is their Dharma-based kingdom, a way of action, by following which one prospers in this world and the next. 265. This is the thirty-seventh kingdom. 

Thus, for a long time, they protect the people and the kings. When they develop discrimination, they become eager to take initiation. 266. 

1.  The parts of the earth and other deities. 
2.  With affection, trust, and everything. 
3.  If there is a tendency towards P, L, D. 
4.  The loss of one's own kingdom occurs. 
5.  It happens by rule. 
6.  In this way. 
7.  Having given instruction. 
8.  They protect these L, 50, D. 
9.  By the way of action called kingdom. 

Page #282:
---------------------------
This is the **Nikrant** ritual for those who are renouncing the kingdom and are being repeatedly enlightened by the Laukantika Devas. ||267||

They hand over the kingdom to their eldest son in the presence of all the kings and instruct him on how to rule and raise his children. ||268||

O son, you should be free from the need for wealth in ruling your people. Consider justice as your wealth, for people ruled justly are like wish-fulfilling cows (Kamadhenu). ||269||

O son, consider this the duty of kings: to earn wealth justly, to increase it, to protect it, and to give it to worthy recipients or to holy places. ||270||

To rule your people, you must first protect your own mind. The knowledge of what is beneficial and harmful in both this world and the next is called "mati" (wisdom). ||271||

Therefore, by conquering your senses and associating with wise elders, you should cultivate your intellect through the knowledge of Dharma (righteousness) and Artha (economics). ||272||

If a king acts contrary to this, he will become confused about what is beneficial and harmful, and will fall under the sway of those who are arrogant due to their limited knowledge. ||273||

Kings should make every effort to uphold the traditions of their lineage, for one who is ignorant of his lineage's customs can corrupt it with his own misdeeds. ||274||

Furthermore, a king should always strive to protect himself, for when the king is safe, everything else is safe. ||275||

A king who does not protect himself will be destroyed by enemies, or by his own servants who are angry, greedy, or scorned. ||276||

Therefore, a king should avoid those dangers that are initially pleasant but ultimately harmful, and protect himself through the efforts of his trusted advisors. ||277||

Moreover, a king should strive to be righteous in his conduct, for even his own people will overcome him if he is unrighteous. ||278|| 

Page #283:
---------------------------
## The Thirty-Eighth Chapter

265. A king should be impartial in his dealings with his subjects, for a king who is not impartial is despised by his own people. 279. Impartiality in a king means treating all subjects equally, without any bias. This impartiality should not be accompanied by cruelty or violence, nor should it be characterized by harsh words or punishments. 280. A king who conquers the six internal enemies - lust, anger, greed, delusion, pride, and jealousy - and who follows this path of impartiality, remains steadfast in his kingdom and prospers in this world and the next. 281. Impartiality, upholding the family tradition, protecting the intellect, self-preservation, and the welfare of the subjects - these are the duties of a king. 282. Therefore, O son, by upholding this Kshatriya Dharma as described, you will remain steadfast in your kingdom and attain fame, righteousness, and victory. 283. Those who are serene in mind and have attained knowledge, having instructed their son in this way, are honored by the Indras for their auspicious initiation. 284. Then, after giving away great wealth and relinquishing the throne, these great kings, the Rajarshis, depart from their homes for the forest. 285-286. First, the chief kings lift him from the earth and carry him on their shoulders for a short distance. Then, the devoted gods carry him on their shoulders. He ascends a divine palanquin, adorned with brilliant jewels, resembling the chariot of the sun as it traverses the earth. 287. The gods and demons precede him, blocking all paths in the sky, their radiance casting doubt on the sun's brilliance. 288. With great love and excitement, all the kings stand before him, their hearts filled with joy at the arrival of the new king. 289. The treasures and jewels, their brilliance dimmed by his departure, follow behind him, like a cloud of flags carried by the wind, filling the sky.

The remaining acts, such as the shaving of the head and the worship of the Bhagavan, were already described during the initiation of Vrishabhadeva. **294**
Thus ends the forty-eighth initiation.

This is the Parinishkranti, the action that bestows Nirvana. Beyond this, for the seeker of liberation, comes the Yoga-sammaha. **295**
When he, having renounced all external and internal attachments, practices the state of non-attachment, and embraces the arduous and supreme practice of the Jina-kalpa, **266**
then, having ascended the ladder of the Kshapaka-shreni, and having reached the appropriate stage, **297**
the fire of pure meditation burns away the dense forest of karmic defilements, both external and internal, **298**
and the supreme light of Kevala-jnana, illuminating both the world and the beyond, manifests. **299**
This is the Yoga-sammaha, a distinct action for those who have achieved perfection and attained supreme brilliance. **300**
The union of knowledge and meditation is called Yoga, and the extraordinary brilliance that arises from it is called Yoga-sammaha. **301**
Thus ends the forty-ninth action, Yoga-sammaha.

After the birth of Kevala-jnana, the lords of the gods, having worshipped the Bhagavan, **301**
manifest their external glory, characterized by the qualities of protection and so on.

## The Thirty-Eighth Chapter

**267**

The eight **Pratiharys**, the twelve divine assemblies, the **stupa**, the rows of houses, the enclosure of the fort, and the rows of flags, etc., are all wonderful and glorious. These are the characteristics of the **Arhanty** (the liberated soul), and they are followed by another action called **Kriyaantara** (other action). ||302||

**_Thus ends the Arhanty Kriya._**

The **Vihar** (contemplation) of the **Arhanty** is well-known and is described in detail in the **Dharmachakra** (wheel of Dharma). It is not repeated here. ||303||

**_Thus ends the Vihar Kriya._**

After this, for the benefit of others, the **Arhanty** teaches the path of Dharma. This is called **Yogatyaga** (renunciation of yoga), the highest action of the **Arhanty** who has performed the **Tirtha Vihar** (pilgrimage). ||305||

The **Vihar** ends, the assembly (**Samavasarana**) dissolves, and the **Arhanty** performs his **Vritti** (activity) to restrain the **Yoga** (concentration). This is called **Yogatyaga**. ||306||

The **Kriyaantara** (other action) known as **Kevali Samudghat** (the opening of the **Kevali**), which includes the **Danda** (staff), the **Kapat** (door), etc., is included in the **Yogatyaga** and is not described separately. ||307||

**_Thus ends the Yogatyaga Kriya._**

After this, the **Arhanty** who has completely restrained all **Yogas**, who is the Lord of the Jinas, who has attained the state of **Shaileshi** (the Lord of the mountain), whose **Ghatika Karmas** (karmas that cause death) have been destroyed, who has attained the **Urdhvagati** (ascending path) born from his own nature, and who has reached the highest state of **Nirvana**, is said to have performed the **Agranirvritti** (final liberation). ||308-309||

**_Thus ends the Agranirvritti._**

Thus, from the womb to **Nirvana**, there are fifty-three **Kriyas** (actions) that should always be followed by the **Bhavya** (aspirant). ||310||

These **Kriyas** should be followed by the **Dwijanma** (twice-born) according to the methods described above. The internal differences in these **Kriyas** will be explained in the next chapter. ||311||

## Adipurana, Chapter 38: The Birth and Lineage of the Twice-Born

**Verse 312:** The righteous King Bharata, establishing the Twice-Born in his Dharma, spoke of the **Garbhanvaya** (lineage of the womb), encompassing the stages from conception to liberation, a total of fifty-three. He then began to speak of the **Dikshanvaya** (lineage of initiation), which are also worthy of being narrated.

**Verse 313:** The noble soul who, having heard and understood these **Garbhaadhika** (womb-related) actions, deemed worthy by the best of the Twice-Born, immerses himself in the vision of the Jinesvara, acquires the necessary materials both from himself and others, and performs these actions, becomes a **Bhavya** (worthy) soul, adorned with the jewel of complete knowledge, and attains the supreme position of the three worlds, i.e., liberation.

Thus ends the thirty-eighth chapter of the **Trishattilakshana Mahapurana Sangraha**, composed by the revered **Jinaseenaacharya**, which describes the birth and lineage of the Twice-Born.

**Note:** The translation preserves the Jain terms like **Garbhanvaya**, **Dikshanvaya**, **Garbhaadhika**, and **Bhavya**.

## Forty-First Chapter

Then the wise one spoke to the twice-born, "There are forty-eight *Deekshaanvaya Kriyaas* which lead to liberation. Listen, O twice-born, I will speak of the actions that lead to liberation, those suitable for the initiated, from the time of their descent to their liberation."

"The initiation is of two types, *Mahavrat* and *Anuvrat*, and so are the vows. *Mahavrat* is the complete renunciation of all sins like violence, etc., while *Anuvrat* is the renunciation of gross sins like violence, etc."

"The attitude of a person who is ready to take initiation is called *Deeksha*, and the actions related to that initiation are called *Deekshaanvaya Kriyaas*."

"The number of these *Deekshaanvaya Kriyaas* has been previously established as forty-eight. Now, the characteristics of these actions will be described."

"The first *Deekshaanvaya Kriya* is called *Aavataar*. This is performed when a *Bhavya* (soul destined for liberation) who is tainted by *Mithyatva* (false belief) is ready to embrace the right path."

"He, being wise, approaches a wise and virtuous *Muni* (ascetic) or a householder teacher and asks, "O wise ones, please tell me the true Dharma (righteousness) without any flaws. The beliefs of others seem to me to be flawed."

"Even the scriptures, which are considered authoritative in the performance of actions, are not able to withstand scrutiny. They are flawed and created by wicked people."

*Adipurana*

The wise sage, or householder teacher, explains the truth, the path to liberation, and the Dharma, which is full of contemplation, to the one who asks. 11. Know that the words of the *Apta* are true and lead to liberation, and that any other words that are not spoken by the *Apta* are merely the dirt of speech. 12. The *Apta* is free from attachment, all-knowing, benevolent, and speaks with appropriate, truthful, and pure words. Those who are not *Apta* but appear to be are called *Apta-abhasa*. 13. Those who follow the path of form, energy, qualities, state, meditation, characteristics, powers, giving, beauty, victory, knowledge, vision, strength, and the nectar of happiness, and who are superior to even the Chakravartin and Indra, are *Apta*. They are all-knowing and the supreme lord of all worlds. 14-15. Therefore, the Jain doctrine, which is spoken by the *Apta*, cannot be refuted, and even those who claim to be all-knowing cannot touch it. 16. It is based on logic and scripture, unparalleled, radiant, profound, concise, and free from doubt. It is known as the word of the self-existent. 17. The scriptures, mantras, and rituals, which are not found in other doctrines, are well-explained in the doctrine of the *Arhant* and are therefore authoritative. 18. My dear child, I will explain these concepts in detail, because when they are approached, the words of other doctrines appear to be false. 19. The Dharma is that which contains the true explanation of the Vedas, Puranas, Smritis, conduct, rituals, mantras, deities, symbols, and purity of food, etc., as explained by the great sages. Any other path is merely an *Apta-abhasa*. 21.

**272**

The one who hears the teachings of the Adi Purana, he, being superior to the best of teachers, abandons the wrong path and fixes his mind on the right path. ||33||

The Guru is the father, and the knowledge of the truth is the well-cultivated womb. The noble soul descends into that womb of knowledge through the birth of Dharma. ||34||

This process of descent is similar to the conception of a child, as birth is not involved in either case. ||35||

Thus ends the process of descent. Then, the second process, called "Vrittalaabh," takes place when the noble soul, bowing down at the feet of the Guru, receives the set of vows according to the prescribed rules. ||36||

Thus ends the "Vrittalaabh." Then, the third process, called "Sthanalaabh," takes place for the one who has observed the fast, and it involves the performance of worship. The proper procedure for this is as follows: ||37||

In a clean place within the Jain temple, draw an eight-petaled lotus or a circular mandala representing the place of the Jina. ||38||

Draw this lotus or mandala with fine powder mixed with water, or with sandalwood paste, etc. ||39||

When this eight-petaled lotus or the mandala of the Jina, drawn according to the prescribed rules, has been fully worshipped by the learned scholars, the Acharya should seat the noble soul facing the image of the Jina and touch his head repeatedly, saying, "This is your initiation as a Shravak." ||40-41||

Touch his head with the five-finger mudra and say, "You are purified by this initiation." Then, give him the remaining Akshat from the worship. ||42||

Then, teach him the five-fold prostration mantra, saying, "This mantra will purify you from all sins." ||43||

After performing this ritual, the Acharya should release him for the breaking of the fast. The noble soul, being pleased by the Guru's grace, should then return to his home. ||44||

Thus ends the "Sthanalaabh."

The seeker, abandoning attachment to the wrong path, fixes his mind on the right path. ||33||

At that time, the Guru is his father, and the knowledge of the truth is the well-cultivated womb. The noble soul descends into that womb of knowledge through the birth of Dharma. ||34||

This process is considered similar to conception, as birth is not involved in either case. ||35||

This is the first process of descent.

Then, the second process, called "Vrittalaabh," takes place when the noble soul, bowing down at the feet of the Guru, receives the set of vows according to the prescribed rules. ||36||

This is the second process, called "Vrittalaabh."

## The Thirty-Fourth Chapter

**273**  "The **Gana-graha** (gathering of the group) takes place when a **bhavy** (aspirant for liberation) expels the **mithya-devatas** (false deities) from his home.  

**45**  "For so long, due to ignorance, I have worshipped you with respect. Now, I will worship the deities of my own faith. 

**46**  "Therefore, it is futile to be angry. Go wherever you wish." 

**47**  "Thus, he should take them away and abandon them in another place, openly."

**48**  "This is the **Gana-graha**, the previous gathering of deities.  Having abandoned them, he should worship the deities of his own time, with peace."

**This is the Gana-graha kriya (action).**

**49**  "After this, there is another kriya known as **Puja-radhya** (worship and study), which involves wealth, **puja** (worship), and **upavasa** (fasting).  Listen to the **anga-artha-sangraha** (summary of the meaning of the angas)."

**This is the Puja-radhya kriya.**

**50**  "Then, there is another kriya called **Punnya-yajna** (merit-sacrifice), which is conducive to **punya** (merit).  Listen to the meaning of the fourteen **purva-vidyas** (previous knowledge) along with your **sa-brahmacharin** (fellow student)."

**This is the Punnya-yajna kriya.**

**51**  "Thus, having completed the study of his own scriptures, he should listen to other scriptures or other subjects. This is the **Dridha-charya** (firm conduct) kriya."

**This is the Dridha-charya kriya.**

**52**  "For one who has a firm **vrat** (vow), there is another kriya called **Upayogita** (usefulness).  This involves the **pratima-yoga-dharana** (holding of the image of the **Tirthankara**) until the **parva-upavasa** (festival fast)."

**This is the Upayogita kriya.**

**44**  "After the **parana** (breaking of the fast), he should take leave and go home, satisfied with the grace of his **guru** (teacher), and he will be a **bhavy** (aspirant for liberation)."

**This is the third **sthana-labha** (attainment of a place) kriya. **

**45**  "When a **bhavy** (aspirant for liberation) expels the **mithya-devatas** (false deities) from his home, the **Gana-graha** (gathering of the group) kriya takes place.  

**46-47**  "At that time, he should say to them, 'Due to my ignorance, I have worshipped you with respect for so long. But now, I will worship the deities of my own faith. Therefore, it is futile to be angry. Go wherever you wish.'  Thus, he should take them away and abandon them in another place, openly."

**Upaniti Kriya:**

The act of adopting the auspicious signs of a worthy man, who has attained purity through the performance of the nine acts mentioned above, is called Upaniti Kriya. [53]

The Upaniti Kriya consists of the proper observance of one's attire, conduct, and time, in the presence of the deity and the guru. [54]

Wearing white clothes, the sacred thread (Yajnopavit), etc., is called attire. Living a life of six virtuous acts, like worshiping the deity, is called conduct. [55]

The initiation of a Jain devotee, according to the scriptures, is called time. [56]

This is the ninth Kriya called Upaniti.

**Vratacharya Kriya:**

After this, the worthy man, adorned with the sacred thread, should practice the principles of the Upasaka (devotee) by studying the scriptures and understanding their meaning. This is called Vratacharya Kriya. [57]

This is the tenth Kriya called Vratacharya.

**Vrataavtarana Kriya:**

When a devotee, who has mastered all knowledge, receives ornaments, etc., in the presence of the guru, according to the scriptures, it is called Vrataavtarana Kriya. [58]

This is the eleventh Kriya called Vrataavtarana.

**Vivah Kriya:**

When a worthy man initiates his wife into the path of a devotee, with the proper vows, it is called Vivah Kriya. [59]

For a worthy man who desires to perform the rituals for his wife, the same marriage rituals should be performed again, with the worship of the Siddhas (liberated souls) as the primary act, and all the previously mentioned rituals should be followed. [60]

This is the twelfth Kriya called Vivah.

**Notes:**

1. Kriya means act or ritual.
2. The text refers to the nine acts mentioned earlier in the text.
3. Yajnopavit is the sacred thread worn by Jain devotees.
4. Upasaka refers to a Jain devotee.
5. Vrata refers to vows or principles.
6. Siddhas are liberated souls in Jainism.

The forty-first chapter, **Varna Labha** (Attainment of Caste)

**275** This is the procedure for the attainment of caste for a person who desires to establish a relationship with other **Shravakas** (lay followers) who are engaged in the same livelihood.

**61** The **Bhavyapurusha** (noble soul) should invite four senior **Shravakas** who have completed their **Sakkiya** (spiritual practices) and say to them:

**62** "Please make me equal to yourselves and bestow your grace upon me. You are **Dev Brahmanas** (divine Brahmanas) who liberate beings from the cycle of birth and death, and you are revered in the world. I have also taken initiation and accepted the vows of a **Shravaka**.

**63** I have practiced all the **Dharma** (righteousness) of householders, given **Dana** (charity), and performed **Guru Puja** (worship of the teacher).

**64** By the grace of my **Guru** (spiritual teacher), I have been born without a **Yoni** (womb) and have abandoned the **Mithyatva** (false beliefs) that I had nurtured for a long time, and have attained **Samyak Charitra** (right conduct) which I had never contemplated before.

**65** I have taken the **Yajnopavita** (sacred thread) for the sake of attaining **Vrata Siddhi** (perfection of vows) and have become learned by studying the **Shravaka Achar** (conduct of a Shravaka) thoroughly.

**66** After performing the **Vrata Avataran** (ceremony of accepting vows), I have accepted **Abharana** (ornaments) and have performed the **Sanskar** (ceremony) of my wife and remarried her.

**67** Thus, it is appropriate for me, who has taken the vows, to attain **Varna Labha**. It is easily attainable with your permission, O **Sadharmi** (fellow practitioners of Dharma).

**68** Upon hearing this, the **Shravakas** should say: "Yes, it shall be so. What you have said is commendable. Who else is like you, O **Dvija** (twice-born)?

**69** In the absence of people like you, we are compelled to establish relationships even with **Mithyadrishti** (those with false beliefs) who are engaged in the same livelihood.

**70** Saying this, they should reassure him and bestow upon him **Varna Labha**. He, in turn, having received **Varna Labha** according to the proper procedure, attains equality with those **Shravakas**.

**71** This is the **Varna Labha Kriya** (procedure for attaining caste). Now, the **Kula Charaya** (family tradition) will be explained. The **Kula Charaya** of a **Pushkala** (prosperous) **Arya** (noble person) consists of the following six practices:

**72** 1. **Kanya Pradana** (giving away a daughter in marriage)
2. **Dana** (charity)
3. **Samvidhatu** (to desire to establish a relationship)
4. **Sadrisha Arya Shatkarma** (similar noble practices)
5. **Vichkshana** (discerning)
6. **Chatur Sankhyan** (four in number)
7. **Yushmat Sadrishikrut** (made equal to you)
8. **Chira Kala Sanskarit** (nurtured for a long time) - This refers to **Mithyatva Vritti

## The Adipurana

**Chapter 276**

**The Fourteen Stages of the Kulacaryā**

**72.**  The performance of the six actions, namely, proper worship of the gods, etc., with complete dedication, is called Kulacaryā.

**The Fifteen Stages of the Diksha-Anvaya**

**73-74.**  The Śrāvaka, purified by the above-mentioned conduct, attains the stage of Gṛhīśitā.  He who is capable of benefiting others through his perfect conduct and the wealth of knowledge acquired through study, who knows the rules of atonement, and who is well-versed in the Śruti, Smṛti, and Purāṇa, attains the position of a Gṛhasthācārya and thus assumes the stage of Gṛhīśitā.

**75.**  This Gṛhīśitā is the fifteenth stage.  Thereafter, the same state of tranquility as before is considered to be the stage of Praśāntatā for the Bhavyā who has attained various types of fasts and other practices.

**76.**  This Praśāntatā is the sixteenth stage.  Then, when he renounces his household life and, after properly instructing his son in accordance with Dharma, leaves his home, he undergoes the stage of Gṛhatyāga.

**77.**  This Gṛhatyāga is the seventeenth stage.  After leaving his home and entering the Tapovana, the wearing of a single garment is considered the stage of Dīkṣādyā.

**78.**  This Dīkṣādyā is the eighteenth stage.  Then, when he abandons his household garments and, with proper conduct, adopts the Digambara form from a worthy Muni, he is said to have attained the stage of Jinarūpatā.

**79.**  This Jinarūpatā is the nineteenth stage.  The remaining stages are to be explained in the same way as the stages of Garbhānvaya.  There is no difference between them.

**80.**  The Bhavyā who, knowing these stages, practices them, attains Nirvāṇa very soon, becoming subject to happiness.  Thus ends the description of the stages of Diksha-Anvaya.

**Notes:**

* **Kulacaryā:** The practice of the Jain householder.
* **Gṛhīśitā:** The stage of a householder who is dedicated to spiritual practice.
* **Praśāntatā:** The stage of tranquility and peace.
* **Gṛhatyāga:** The stage of renouncing household life.
* **Dīkṣādyā:** The stage of initiation into the monastic life.
* **Jinarūpatā:** The stage of attaining the form of a Jina (liberated being).
* **Garbhānvaya:** The stages of a soul's journey from birth to liberation.
* **Bhavyā:** A soul destined for liberation.
* **Nirvāṇa:** Liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

The forty-first chapter. Now I shall speak to the twice-born about the actions of the lineage (kanvaya kriya) which are possible for the soul who is close to liberation. 

Among these actions of lineage, the first one that brings about auspiciousness is *sajjati*, which occurs when a near-liberated soul attains human birth. 

When a soul attains human birth and is eligible for initiation, and is born into a pure lineage, then this action called *sajjati* occurs. 

*Sajjati* is said to be the wealth of pure lineage and pure birth. It is from *sajjati* that a virtuous person attains higher and higher lineages. 

The purity of the father's lineage is called *kula*, and the purity of the mother's lineage is called *jati*. 

The purity of both of these is called *sajjati*. When *sajjati* is attained, the three jewels are easily obtained through the naturally acquired qualities. 

*Sajjati* is especially attained in the Aryavarta region. When the body and other necessary materials are present, it brings about many kinds of auspiciousness for beings. 

This *sajjati* is described as being born with a pure body, because it is the root cause of the fulfillment of all the desired things for humans. 

Another *sajjati* is described as being born from the action of *sanskaras*. By attaining this, the liberated soul attains the birth of a twice-born. 

Just as a gem born from a pure mine attains excellence through the action of *sanskaras*, so too does the soul, who is well-refined by actions and mantras, attain the highest excellence. 

Or, just as a piece of gold, through the action of purification, becomes pure, so too does the liberated soul become pure by attaining the actions of *sanskaras*. 

This *sanskaras* is born from knowledge, and the most excellent knowledge is right knowledge. When a virtuous soul attains this excellent knowledge directly from the mouth of the omniscient, then...

Adipurana - At that time, he is born from the womb of supreme knowledge, through the birth of संस्कार. He is called a द्विज, adorned with vows and conduct. ||13||
The mark of his vow is the सूत्र, preceded by a mantra. It is made of material, conceived of as distinct from the essence, and is the chief instrument of the knowledge of the omniscient. ||94||
His sacred thread (यज्ञोपवीत) is made of three materials. His सूत्र, however, is based on the essence, and is made of three qualities. ||95||
When he has received the संस्कार, he attains the supreme Brahman. Then, the leaders of the गणs welcome him with words of blessing. ||96||
They give him the remaining Jain flowers and rice grains, which are appropriate. This is a form of stabilization and a great encouragement to Dharma. ||97||
He is born from the divine womb of knowledge, without a womb. Having attained this supreme birth, he becomes a member of the same caste. ||98||
Then, having attained the same caste, he becomes a good householder. As a householder, he follows the six duties of the Aryas. ||99||
He performs all the pure conduct prescribed in the household life, without laziness. ||100||
He has received a noble birth from the Jinas, and has been taught by the गणendras. This best द्विज possesses the supreme brilliance of Brahman. ||101||
At that time, the righteous people praise him, saying, "You are like the supreme brilliance of Brahman, who has descended to the earth." ||102||
He is wise, and performs sacrifices, being worshipped by the sacrificers. He teaches and learns the Vedas and their branches. ||103||

The Forty-First Chapter

276. Even though he touches the earth, he is not touched by the faults of the earth. He attains the state of a god through his praiseworthy qualities. ||10||

He does not possess the power of becoming small (Aṇimā), but he possesses the power of becoming large (Mahimā). He does not possess the power of becoming light (Lāghīmā), but he possesses the power of becoming heavy (Garimā). He possesses the qualities of attainment (Prāpti), fulfillment of desires (Prākaṁya), lordship (Īśitva), and control (Vaśitva). ||105||

His glory is increasing due to these qualities. He is becoming like a god and is adorned with a radiant brilliance that transcends the world. This glorious being is worshipped on earth. ||106||

Through righteous conduct, truthfulness, purity, forgiveness, and self-control, he cultivates the praiseworthy qualities of a divine Brahmin within himself. ||107||

If someone who considers himself a Brahmin, driven by the arrogance of his caste, were to say to this divine Brahmin, "Have you attained godhood only today?" ||108||

"Are you not the son of so-and-so? And is your mother not the daughter of so-and-so? Why have you become so arrogant and refuse to honor men like me?" ||109||

"Your caste is the same, your lineage is the same, and you are the same as you were this morning. Yet, you consider yourself a god." ||110||

"Although you are skilled in the duties of gods, guests, ancestors, and fire, you are averse to bowing down to gurus, Brahmins, and gods." ||111||

"What special benefit have you gained by accepting Jain initiation? For you are still a human being, walking on the earth with your feet." ||112||

If someone were to speak to him in this manner, filled with anger, he should respond with words full of wisdom. ||113||

"Listen, O Brahmin, who considers himself a Brahmin. Hear about my divine birth. The Jina is our father, and his knowledge is pure and radiant." ||114||

**115.**  The three distinct powers of Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct, which are related to the Arhant Devas, are based on the three qualities of attainment, use, and refinement, and we, having attained them, are born from the birth of refinement.

**116.** We are born without a womb, therefore we are Devas, not humans. If there are others like us, tell me their characteristics.

**117.** We are born from the mouth of Svayambhu, therefore we are Devas and Brahmanas. The mark of our vows is the sacred thread, as declared in the scriptures.

**118.** You, who follow the thread of sin, are not Brahmanas, only those who wear the thread on their necks. You are merely contaminated with impurities, sharp thorns on the path of righteousness.

**119.** There are two types of birth for living beings: bodily birth and birth of refinement. Similarly, Jain scriptures state that there are two types of death for living beings.

**120.** The attainment of another body after the destruction of the previous body is known as bodily birth for those who have a body.

**121.** The attainment of the self-knowledge again through the practice of refinement is called the birth of refinement, which is born from refinement.

**122.** The death of the body is the abandonment of the body at the end of one's lifespan. The death of refinement is the abandonment of sins by a vow-taker.

**123.** One who has attained all the refinements and abandons the previous state of false belief is considered dead in a way.

**124.** This excellent birth, born from refinement, is free from sin and has been attained by me through the guidance of my Guru, therefore I am called a Deva-Brahmana.

**125.** By revealing the excellence of his soul through the path of righteousness, this man, having attained the supreme state of Sadgrihitva, becomes a Sadgrihastha.

**126.** I will further explain the Brahmanas who are worthy of action, to dispel the pride of their caste.

Those who are the offspring of Brahma are called Brahmanas. Brahma himself is the Self-Existent, the Lord, the Supreme, the Best Jina. ||127||
The Jina-Indra is the Supreme Brahma from the beginning, because he is the enhancer of qualities. The wise sages consider the Supreme Brahma to be under his control. ||128||
He who wears the skin of a deer, is adorned with matted hair, beard, etc., and who, having become a lustful donkey, has fallen from his Brahma-tejas, is not a Brahma. ||129||
Those who have been born from the pure womb of knowledge of the Jina-Indra, who has a divine form, are considered to be twice-born. ||130||
These best of the twice-born should not be considered to be within the categories of caste, because they have attained greatness through the performance of vows, mantras, and other rituals. ||131||
We know those who are the best of the castes, who are devoted to forbearance and purity, who are content, who have attained excellence, and whose adornment is blameless conduct. ||132||
Those who are of impure conduct, who falsely consider themselves to be twice-born, who are always eager to begin sin, and who cruelly kill animals, are not Brahmanas. ||133||
What will be the fate of those who, accepting all the sacrificial rites that are full of violence, kill animals, and who earn their livelihood from the scriptures of sin? ||134||
"They declare the Dharma to be that which is characterized by instigation and the Adharma." I see no other Karma-Chandala on this earth than those who accept this Dharma. ||135||
Those who, being cruel, kill animals, are plunderers, wicked scholars, and external to the righteous, are worthy of punishment by the kings. ||136||
Those who are more merciless than even the Rakshasas, who are cruel even to the point of killing animals, if such men are considered to be excellent, then...
1. Situated in the Supreme Abode.
2. The meaning is "having the face of a donkey due to lust."
3. Due to the attainment of learning.
4. From the unpolluted.
5. The meaning is "those who are confined to caste alone."
6. Wicked.
7. From, or directly.
8. Full of violence.
9. Those who commit violence.
10. As described in the Vedas.
11. They make a promise.
12. Thieves.
13. Merciless.
14. From the beginning of killing animals.
15. Than the Rakshasas. "Rakshasa is a corner-dweller, a devourer of flesh, a drinker of blood, and a devourer of flesh."
16. Excellence.

**282**

These twice-born (Dwijas) who follow impure conduct are considered to be in the dark category (Krishnavarga) by the wise. Jainas, however, who follow pure conduct are considered to be in the bright category (Shuklavarga).  ||138||

The purity of the twice-born is based on the Vedas, Smritis, Puranas, good conduct, mantras, and rituals. It is also achieved by wearing the sacred thread (Devatalinga) and by renouncing desires. ||139||

Those who follow the most pure conduct, which is based on the Vedas, Smritis, etc., should be considered to be in the bright category (Shuklavarga). The rest, who are outside this purity, are considered to be impure. ||140||

Their purity and impurity should be understood based on their righteous and unrighteous conduct. Compassionate conduct is righteous, while killing living beings is unrighteous. ||141||

Therefore, Jainas, who follow pure conduct, are the highest among all castes. They are the true twice-born (Dwijas). They are not part of the Brahman, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and Shudra categories, but are superior to them and worthy of respect in the world. ||142||

Now, there might be a doubt that Jainas who are householders (Grihastha) and earn their livelihood through the six activities (Shatkarma) like agriculture, trade, etc., might also be guilty of violence. But, we say that what you have said is true. There might be a slight association with violence in the case of Jain householders who earn their livelihood through the six activities. However, the scriptures also show the purification of these faults. ||143-144||

Their purity has three aspects: **Paksham** (conduct), **Charya** (vow), and **Sadhanam** (means). Now, I will explain these three. ||145||

Among these three, **Paksham** for Jainas is the complete abandonment of all violence, which is strengthened by friendliness, joy, compassion, and impartiality. ||146||

**Charya** is the vow taken to not harm any living being, whether it is for the sake of a deity, for the success of a mantra, or for the preparation of medicine or food. ||147||

If, due to carelessness, a fault occurs in this vow, then purification is achieved through atonement. After that, one should renounce the household life and establish oneself in the path of liberation. ||148||

---------------------------
## Forty-First Chapter

**283.** The life of householders has been described. Now, the means of liberation at the end of life is being explained. Renunciation of body, food, and all actions, and purification of the soul through meditation, is called the means of liberation. (149)

**284.** There is no contact with the Arhant Dev's followers, their conduct, and their means of liberation, even through violence. In this way, the faults that have been attributed to oneself can be eradicated. (150)

**285.** The purity of the four Ashramas is also according to the Arhant Dev's teachings. The four Ashramas that others have accepted are beautiful without consideration, meaning they are beautiful until they are examined. (151)

**286.** The four Ashramas of the Jains are Brahmachari, Grihastha, Vanaprastha, and Bhikshu, which are attained in increasing order of purity. (152)

**287.** These four Ashramas, along with their internal divisions, become diverse. They should be known in detail, but their elaboration is not included here due to the fear of lengthening the text. (153)

**288.** This practice of enhancing one's soul through virtues is known as Sadgrihitva. Now, the third practice, Parivajy, which is extremely pure, will be explained. (154)

**289.** This is the second practice of Sadgrihitva. By following the duties of a householder and becoming detached from dwelling in a house, the acceptance of initiation by a man is called Parivajy. (155)

**290.** The state of a Parivaji, which is the state of liberation, is called Parivajy. In this practice of Parivajy, one must abandon the sense of "mine" and adopt the Digambar form. (156)

**291.** A seeker of liberation should accept initiation from a Nirgrantha Acharya on an auspicious day, auspicious constellation, auspicious yoga, auspicious Lagna, and auspicious planetary positions. (157)

**292.** A person whose lineage and clan are pure, whose character is excellent, whose face is beautiful, and whose intellect is sharp, is considered fit for initiation. (158)

**293.** Initiation should not be taken on a day when there is an eclipse of the planets, an eclipse of the sun or moon, a halo around the sun or moon, a rainbow, the rise of malefic planets, the sky covered with clouds, or a lost or extra month. 

Page #302:
---------------------------
## The Adipurana, Chapter 6, Verses 160-168:

**160.**  A wise Acharya (teacher) does not initiate a seeker into the path of liberation (diksha) on a day that is a *nasta-mas* (a day that is lost due to a lunar month having an extra day), a *san-kranti* (a day of planetary conjunction), or a *kṣaya-tithi* (a day of waning lunar phase).

**161.**  An Acharya who disregards this tradition and initiates a seeker on such a day is considered to be disrespectful to the elders and is worthy of being expelled by the community of monks.

**162.**  The wise monks have identified twenty-seven key principles (sutra-pada) that define the essence of the monastic life (parivrajya).

**163.**  These principles include: *jati* (birth), *murti* (form), *laksana* (characteristics), *sundara-anga-ta* (beautiful body), *prabha* (radiance), *mandala* (circle), *chakra* (wheel), *abhisheka* (consecration), *natha-ta* (lordship), *simhasana* (throne), *upadhana* (garments), *chhatra* (umbrella), *chamara* (fly whisk), *ghoshan* (announcement), *ashoka-vriksha* (ashoka tree), *nidhi* (treasure), *griha-shobha* (beauty of the house), *avagahan* (bathing), *kshetra-jna* (knower of the field), *ajna* (command), *sabha* (assembly), *kirti* (fame), *vandya-ta* (worthiness of respect), *vahana* (vehicle), *bhasha* (language), *ahara* (food), and *sukha* (happiness).

**164.**  These twenty-seven principles are considered to be the qualities of the *parameshti* (supreme beings).

**165.**  A seeker should not be attached to their own birth, form, or other qualities, but should strive to embody these qualities of the supreme beings.

**166.**  Even if a seeker is born into a noble lineage, they should remain humble and serve the feet of the Arhant (liberated being).

**167.**  By doing so, they will be reborn into one of the four noble births: *divya* (divine), *vijaya-ashrita* (victorious), *parama* (supreme), and *sva* (self-born).

**168.**  The *divya* birth is that of the Indra (king of the gods), the *vijaya-ashrita* birth is that of the Chakravartin (universal monarch), the *parama* birth is that of the Arhant, and the *sva* birth is that of a liberated being who is born from their own self. 

Page #303:
---------------------------
## Forty-First Chapter

**285**

The fourfold classification should be applied to the *murti* (image) and others as well. Due to the confusion arising from the Puranas, some consider only three categories. [169]

A muni who desires to attain divine *murti* should emaciate his own body and protect the bodies of other beings while performing austerities. [170]

Considering the characteristics of the Jinas, he should contemplate their characteristics and perform austerities, having himself acquired those characteristics. [171]

Wishing for the inevitable and continuous beauty of the divine, the muni should perform severe austerities, diminishing the beauty of his own body. [172]

Having abandoned the radiance emanating from his own body, his body being impure, the muni, meditating on the radiance of the Lord, will quickly become radiant. [173]

Abandoning the brilliance of his own jewels, oil lamps, and other sources of light, the muni, worshipping the luminous Jina, will become a yogi, radiant with a halo of light. [174]

Abandoning weapons, clothes, and other weapons of the past, the yogi, worshipping the Jina, will become the lord of the wheel of Dharma. [175]

Abandoning the rituals of bathing, etc., and taking refuge in the liberated Jina, the muni will attain the supreme anointment of birth on the peak of Mount Meru. [176]

Abandoning his worldly ownership and serving the supreme Lord, the Jina, the muni will be served by all beings in the world. [177]

Abandoning the different types of seats suitable for him, the muni, becoming a Digambara, will ascend the throne and become a propagator of the Tirtha. [178]

**Footnotes:**

1. *Parigraha* (possessions)
2. *Divya-murti*, *Vijay-murti*, *Parama-murti*, *Svatma-uttha-murti* - these terms should be applied in the same way in the following verses.
3. *Siddh* (liberated souls)
4. *Dhyatva* (contemplating)
5. *Guna* (qualities)
6. *Mlani* (diminishing)

Having attained the great liberation, becoming a Jina, and having become active in the attainment of liberation, he is adorned with a brilliant cushion made by the gods. ||10|| Having abandoned all his possessions, including cool umbrellas and all coverings for his body, he is adorned with three umbrellas, shining with brilliance. ||18|| Having abandoned various fans, and having followed the rules of austerity, he is honored with sixty-four chamaras in the Jina-paraya. ||12|| Having abandoned the sound of drums and music, and having performed austerity, his victory is proclaimed by the sound of celestial drums. ||183|| Having abandoned the shade created by gardens and the like, he performed austerity. Therefore, he is now the great Ashoka tree. ||184|| Having abandoned his own wealth, which is appropriate for his own enjoyment, and having attained the state of non-attachment, he is served by treasures at his door. ||185|| Having abandoned the beauty of his home, which was protected on all sides, and having performed austerity, the beauty of the Srimandapa comes to him of its own accord. ||186|| Because of his immersion in austerity, he attains deep immersion. His immersion is for the benefit of all beings in the three worlds. ||187|| Having abandoned his land and buildings, and having become the knower of the self, he attains the sovereignty of the three worlds. ||188|| Having abandoned pride in giving orders, and having become silent, he attains the supreme order, which is worn on the heads of the gods and demons. ||189|| Having abandoned the company of his beloved servants, relatives, and the like, he attains the supreme state of liberation, and he is worthy of the assembly of the three worlds. ||190||

He who renounces all desires, is a great ascetic, and remains equanimous in praise and blame, is praised by the lords of the three worlds. (61)

He who, having bowed down to the worthy, the Arhant, performed austerities, is therefore bowed down to by the worthy, the repository of praiseworthy qualities. (192)

He who, renouncing footwear and vehicles, practices austerities by walking on foot, is worthy of having lotus flowers placed at his feet. (193)

He who, being a guardian of speech and following the path of beneficial speech, is established in austerities, therefore obtains divine speech that pleases all assemblies. (194)

He who, having practiced austerities by fasting, or by regulated food and parana, therefore obtains divine, victorious, supreme, and ambrosial satisfactions. (195)

He who, having renounced the pleasures of desire, remained steadfast in austerities for a long time, therefore, becoming the embodiment of happiness, enjoys supreme bliss. (196)

What is the use of saying much here? Briefly, it is enough to say that whatever a monk renounces without any intention, that very thing produces that very austerity for him. (197)

The fruit of that austerity, the jewel of contemplation, is the attainment of the highest state, and the attainment of the Arhant lineage and form, as described. (198)

He who, accepting the supreme command of the Jineswari, as stated in the scriptures, practices austerities, that is, takes initiation, his Parivrajya is genuine. (199)

And many other things, bound in a web of words and refuted by logic, are to be abandoned, and this supreme Parivrajya is to be embraced. (200)

Thus ends the Parivrajya.

He resides in the assembly of the three worlds, that is, the Samavasarana ground. (190)

He who renounces all desires, abandons the praise of his qualities, and practices great austerities, remaining equanimous in praise and blame, is praised by the Indras of the three worlds, that is, everyone praises him. (191)

This monk, having performed austerities by bowing down to the worthy Arhant, is therefore bowed down to by the worthy, the venerable ones, and is a repository of praiseworthy, excellent qualities. (192)

He who, renouncing footwear and vehicles, practices austerities by walking on foot, is worthy of having lotus flowers placed at his feet, that is, in the Arhant state, the gods create lotus flowers beneath his feet. (193)

Since this monk, being a guardian of speech and following the path of beneficial speech, is established in austerities, therefore he has obtained divine speech that pleases all assemblies. (194)

This monk, having previously practiced austerities by fasting, or by regulated food and parana, therefore obtains divine, victorious, supreme, and ambrosial satisfactions. (195)

This monk, having renounced the pleasures of desire, remained steadfast in austerities for a long time, therefore, becoming the embodiment of happiness, enjoys supreme bliss. (196)

**Adipuranam**

The attainment of the position of Indra, which results from the rise of the Parivaja fruit, is called the **Surendrata** action. This action has been described earlier. ||201||

This is the fourth **Surendrata** action.

The great kingdom of a Chakravarti, which is adorned with the Chakra jewel and is filled with treasures and jewels, and which is a continuous stream of enjoyment and luxury, is called **Samrajya**. ||202||

This is the fifth **Samrajya** action.

The state of being an Arhat, or the supreme action of Karma, is called the **Arhanty** action. This action leads to the attainment of great auspiciousness, such as the descent from heaven. ||203||

The attainment of the five auspiciousnesses by the Arhat, who has descended from heaven, is known as **Arhanty**. This **Arhanty** action causes disturbance in the three worlds. ||204||

This is the sixth **Arhanty** action.

The state of the Supreme Self, which is free from the bondage of existence, is called **Parinirvritti**. It is also known as **Paranirvana**. ||205||

The purification of the inner self, which results from the destruction of all karmic impurities, is called **Siddhi**. This **Siddhi** is the attainment of one's own self-nature, not the absence of anything, nor the destruction of qualities like knowledge. ||206||

This is the seventh **Parinirvritti** action.

Thus, according to the Agamas, these seven **Karjanvaya** actions have been described. By following these actions, yogis attain the supreme state. ||207||

Whoever, without laziness, performs these three types of actions, described above, attains the supreme abode (Moksha), which brings supreme happiness. ||208||

Whoever remembers this **Purana Dharma**, which is adorned with the flower of the Jain teachings, and which is bound by these actions, and who follows it with a pure mind, will quickly be freed from the bondage of the fear of existence. ||209||

Who, except for this, should embrace this most excellent **Parivaja**? ||210||

This is the third **Parivaja** action.

The soul who is devoted to the feet of the Supreme Jina,
And who has destroyed all karmic bonds,
Such a person, who performs these rituals,
Will be the one who ends birth, old age, and death. ||210|| Shadoolvikridit
The noble soul, having obtained a worthy birth, becomes a householder, then, following the instructions of the Guru, attains the supreme Parivrajya and goes to heaven. There he obtains the wealth of Indra, then, falling from there, he attains the position of a Chakravarti, then, attaining the Arhat position, he becomes the possessor of supreme glory, and then attains Nirvana. ||211||

## Forty-fourth Chapter

Now, I will speak about the **Kriya-Suttra-Chulika** (a commentary on the rituals), where the specific determination of the three actions is discussed. ||1||

Firstly, I will explain the **Kriya-Kalpa** (the ritualistic framework) for the success of these actions. The chanting of mantras is essential for the success of these actions, as the actions of the yogis are dependent on mantras. ||2||

At the beginning of the actions, starting with **Adhana** (the ritual of placing the embryo), one should first establish three **Chhatras** (umbrellas), three **Chakras** (wheels), and three **Havir-Bhujas** (fire altars). ||3||

In the middle of the **Vedi** (altar), one should establish the image of the **Jina** (the Tirthankara) according to the prescribed method. This is the **Mantra-Kalpa** (the ritualistic framework of mantras) prescribed for the worship of these elements. ||4||

While performing these actions, one should chant the **Nirajas** (water-born) mantra, which ends with the word **Namah** (salutation), in the singular form of the fourth case. This means one should chant "**Nirajase Namah**" (Salutation to the Jina, who is free from dust). This mantra brings about the highest purity. ||5||

After that, one should take the **Darbha** (sacred grass) seat and then chant the mantra "**Darpa-Mathanaya Namah**" (Salutation to the one who destroys pride) to pacify obstacles. ||6||

The mantra for offering **Gandha** (fragrance) is "**Shila-Gandhaya Namah**" (Salutation to the Jina, who embodies the fragrance of virtue). Similarly, the mantra for offering **Pushpa** (flowers) is "**Vimalaaya Namah**" (Salutation to the pure one). ||7|| 

Page #309:
---------------------------
## Forty-fourth Chapter

**P**

One should utter the word "Namah" for the purpose of worship. "Namah" should be uttered for the supreme. ||8||

"Namah" should be uttered for the one who illuminates knowledge, and "Namah" for the offering of the lamp.
The mantra is "Namah" to the supreme Shiva. ||6||

**D**

Having consecrated the ground with mantras as prescribed, then the following mantra should be recited by the best of the twice-born:

(Namah to Akshata)
(Namah to Shruta-dhupa)
(Namah to Jnana-udyota)
(Namah to Param-siddha)

The mantra for the pedestal should be recited by the best of the twice-born. ||10||

First, one should utter the word "Satya-jata" with "Namah" at the end, meaning "Namah to Satya-jata" (Salutations to the one who has attained the true birth). Then, one should utter "Ahanya-jata" with "Namah" at the end, meaning "Namah to Ahanya-jata" (Salutations to the one who has attained the praiseworthy birth). ||11||

Then, one should utter "Param-jata" with "Namah" at the end, meaning "Namah to Param-jata" (Salutations to the one who has attained the supreme birth). Then, one should utter "Anupama-jata" with "Namah" at the end, meaning "Namah to Anupama-jata" (Salutations to the one who has attained the unparalleled birth). ||12||

Then, one should utter "Sva-pradhana" with "Namah" at the end, meaning "Namah to Sva-pradhana" (Salutations to the one who has attained the supreme state by his own nature). Then, one should utter "Achala" with "Namah" at the end, meaning "Namah to Achala" (Salutations to the one who is unshakeable in his nature). Then, one should utter "Akshaya" with "Namah" at the end, meaning "Namah to Akshaya" (Salutations to the one who is imperishable). ||13||

Similarly, one should utter "Avyavadha" with "Namah" at the end, meaning "Namah to Avyavadha" (Salutations to the one who is free from obstacles). Then, one should utter "Ananta-jnana" with "Namah" at the end, meaning "Namah to Ananta-jnana" (Salutations to the one who possesses infinite knowledge). Then, one should utter "Ananta-darshana" with "Namah" at the end, meaning "Namah to Ananta-darshana" (Salutations to the one who possesses infinite vision). Then, one should utter "Ananta-virya" with "Namah" at the end, meaning "Namah to Ananta-virya" (Salutations to the one who possesses infinite power). Then, one should utter "Ananta-sukha" with "Namah" at the end, meaning "Namah to Ananta-sukha" (Salutations to the one who possesses infinite bliss). Then, one should utter "Niraja" with "Namah" at the end, meaning "Namah to Niraja" (Salutations to the one who is free from impurities). Then, one should utter "Amedha-jarati" with "Namah" at the end, meaning "Namah to Amedha-jarati" (Salutations to the one who is free from ignorance and old age).

From the *Adipurana*, the *Amara-aprameya* (immortal and immeasurable) is described as being without a womb (i.e., not born). Then, the *Akshobhya* (unshakeable) is described as being *avilīna* (not dissolved) and *paramaghana* (supremely wealthy). ||16||

"I take refuge in the one born of truth, I take refuge in the one worthy of being an Arhat, I take refuge in the mother of the Arhat, I take refuge in the son of the Arhat, I take refuge in the one who has attained eternal knowledge, I take refuge in the one born without equal, I take refuge in the three jewels, Samyagdristi, Samyagdristi, Gyanamoorti, Gyanamoorti, Saraswati, Saraswati, Swaha. May the fruits of service be the six supreme abodes, may there be destruction of untimely death, may there be liberation from the cycle of birth and death."

These mantras are called "jati mantras" because they are the cause of the jati sanskar. Now, we will discuss the "nistarak mantras." 31.

First, one should remember the mantra "Satyajatay Swaha" (I offer oblations to the one who has attained the birth of truth). Then, one should recite the mantra "Arhajatay Swaha" (I offer oblations to the one who has attained the birth of an Arhat).

**301** Three fires should be obtained by the best of the twice-born at the beginning of the ritual, originating from the crown of Indra, the king of the fire deities, with the intention of the three jewels. **82** These three fires are considered to have attained utmost purity by becoming a part of the worship during the final festival of liberation, the Nirvana Mahotsava, of the Tirthankaras, Ganadharas, and ordinary Kevalis. **83** These three great fires, known as Garhapatya, Ahavaniya, and Dakshinagni, should be established in three separate hearths. **84** The twice-born who performs the worship of these three fires with mantras is known as Ahitāgni or Agnihotri, whose house is always adorned with such worship. **85** The use of these three fires during daily worship is for cooking offerings, burning incense, and lighting lamps, i.e., the Garhapatya fire is used for cooking offerings, the Ahavaniya fire for burning incense, and the Dakshinagni fire for lighting lamps. **86** These three fires should be protected with great care in the house and should never be given to others who are uninitiated. **87** The fire itself is not inherently pure, nor is it in the form of a deity, but it becomes pure due to its connection with the worship of the divine form of the Arhant. **88** Therefore, the best of the twice-born consider it a part of the worship and perform its worship, hence there is no fault in worshipping the fire like the worship of the Nirvana field. **89** The worship of fire is considered desirable by the Brahmanas due to the expectation of practical conduct, therefore, this practical conduct should be used by the Jain Brahmanas today. **90** These mantras mentioned above are common mantras, used in all rituals. Now, I will speak of the special mantras related to specific rituals, as far as possible. **91**

**304**

The mantra-yoga-knowledgeable should recite the *bhagi-bhava* pada (phrase) from the Adi Purana. The *bhagi-bhava* pada is the ultimate for the welfare of the great kingdom. **(106)**

The opinion is that the *bhagi-bhava* pada is beneficial for the welfare of the supreme kingdom, etc. The *magi-bhava* pada is considered appropriate for the welfare of the Arhant, and it is connected with the welfare of the Arhant. **(107)**

**Churni:** *Sajat-kalyana-bhagi-bhava*, *Sad-griha-kalyana-bhagi-bhava*, *Vaivha-kalyana-bhagi-bhava*, *Muni-indra-kalyana-bhagi-bhava*, *Surendra-kalyana-bhagi-bhava*, *Mandara-abhisheka-kalyana-bhagi-bhava*, *Yauvarajya-kalyana-bhagi-bhava*, *Maharajya-kalyana-bhagi-bhava*, *Param-rajya-kalyana-magi-bhava*, *Arhant-kalyana-bhagi-bhava* (Mantra for the *moda* ceremony).

**Priyod-bhava Mantra:** This mantra is recited in the *Priyod-bhava* ceremony, preceded by the worship of the Siddhas. It is for the victory of the divine *Nemi* and the supreme *Nemi*. **(108)**

The *bhagi-bhava* pada is for the victory of the Arhant *Nemi*, etc. This mantra is considered appropriate by the twice-born with the letters *swaha* at the end. **(109)**

**Churni:** *Divya-Nemi-vijaya-ya swaha*, *Param-Nemi-vijaya-ya swaha*, *Arhant-Nemi-vijaya-ya swaha*.

**(Priyod-bhava Mantra)**

This is the mantra for the birth ceremony, which is initiated with the *arma* (offering). The child is sprinkled with the water and fragrance of the Siddha's abhisheka (consecration) and placed on the head. **(110)**

The child is endowed with the qualities of the family, caste, age, form, etc., and is virtuous, has children, is fortunate, is free from widowhood, has a gentle and peaceful form, and has right faith. Therefore, O son, you are connected to this mother, and you will obtain the three chakras (wheels) in succession: the divine chakra, the victory chakra, and the supreme chakra, and you will attain happiness. **(111-112)**

Thus, the father should touch the child's limbs, almost in accordance with the principle of similarity. There, he should establish his own resolve, and then recite this mantra. **(113)**

The mantra should be recited, then the phrase "Param-rajya-kalyana-bhagi-bhava" (May you be the recipient of the welfare of the supreme kingdom) should be recited, and then the mantra "Arhant-kalyana-bhagi-bhava" (May you be the recipient of the welfare of the Arhant state) should be recited. **(103-107)**

The term "Nagi" (Nāgī) should be combined with the "Paramarṣi" (Paramarṣi) Linga, and the term "Parma" (Parma) should be combined with the "Paramendra" (Paramendra) Linga and other parts. ||15|| Similarly, "Paramarājya" (Paramarājya), "Paramārhanta" (Paramārhanta), etc., should be combined with the "Paramnirvāṇa" (Paramnirvāṇa) Linga in order. ||155||

**Commentary:**
The mantra is: "Paramanistārakalinga bhāgī bhava, Paramarṣilinga bhāgī bhava, Parmendra linga bhāgī bhava, Paramarājya linga bhāgī bhava, Paramārhanta linga bhāgī bhava, Paramanirvāṇa linga bhāgī bhava" (You should be a part of the Paramnistāra Linga, you should be a part of the Paramarṣi Linga, you should be a part of the Parmendra Linga, you should be a part of the Paramarājya Linga, you should be a part of the Paramārhanta Linga, you should be a part of the Paramanirvāṇa Linga).

The disciple becomes a twice-born (Dvija) after receiving this thread. ||158|| Previously, he was only a Brahmin by birth, but now he has been initiated into the vows and has been born again. Therefore, he becomes a Dvija (twice-born) due to these qualities. ||159|| At this time, the disciple should be given the Anuvrata (Anuvrata) vows in accordance with the scriptures, with the Guru (Guru) as a witness. He should also be initiated into the Gunavrata (Gunavrata) and Śikṣāvratas (Śikṣāvratas) by those who are virtuous and follow the vows. This means that he should be given the five Anuvratas, the three Gunavratas, and the four Śikṣāvratas, along with good conduct. ||160|| After this, the Guru should teach him the Upāsakādhyayana (Upāsakādhyayana) and give him a name that is appropriate for his character.

## Forty-First Chapter

The remaining rules have been previously stated, one should follow them completely. Until one has studied the scriptures, one should live a life of celibacy. ||16||

Now, I will describe the rules of conduct in order. This chapter will be a summary of the duties of the Upasaka. ||16||

There are four types of marks for one who has received the Upanayana: a mark on the head, a mark on the chest, a mark on the waist, and a mark on the thigh. ||16||

These marks are determined by the profession of the individual, such as a warrior, a scribe, a farmer, or a merchant, as is the case with the learned twice-born. ||16||

If a family has been tainted by some fault, even then, if the family is purified by the consent of the king and others, the descendants, including sons and grandsons, are not prohibited from receiving the Upanayana, if their ancestors were eligible for initiation. ||16||

Those born into a family ineligible for initiation, who earn their livelihood through arts and crafts, are not considered eligible for the Upanayana and other rituals. ||17||

For such individuals, the appropriate mark is to wear a single piece of cloth until the time of renunciation. ||17||

They should abstain from meat, engage in marital relations with their wives, refrain from initiating violence, and avoid forbidden food and drink. ||172||

Thus, the complete rules of conduct for a twice-born who has adopted a pure and virtuous lifestyle, purified by vows, are described. ||173||

Ten duties are mentioned in the Upasaka Sutra. We will now describe them briefly, in order. ||17||

One should beg for alms in the homes of those belonging to one's own caste or family, and whatever wealth is obtained from such alms should be respectfully given to the Upadhyaya. ||163||

All the rules have been previously stated. One should follow them completely. Moreover, one should live a life of celibacy until one has studied the scriptures. ||164||

Now, I will describe the rules of conduct in order, summarizing the duties of the Upasaka. ||165||

For a boy who has received the Upanayana, there are four types of marks: a mark on the head (shaving), a mark on the chest (the sacred thread), a mark on the waist (a rope of munja grass), and a mark on the thigh (a white dhoti). These have been previously determined. ||166||

Those who earn their livelihood according to their abilities, such as warriors who use weapons, scribes who use ink, farmers, and merchants, should wear the sacred thread, as is the case with the learned twice-born. ||167||

Even if a family has been tainted by some fault, if the family is purified by the consent of the king and others, the descendants, including sons and grandsons, are not prohibited from receiving the Upanayana, if their ancestors were eligible for initiation. In other words, if a family eligible for initiation is tainted by some fault, it can be purified by the consent of the king and others, and the men of that family can be given the Upanayana. This prohibition does not apply only to the man himself, but also to his sons, grandsons, and other descendants. ||168-169||

Those born into a family ineligible for initiation, who earn their livelihood through arts and crafts, such as dancing and singing, are not considered eligible for the Upanayana and other rituals. ||170||

However, if such individuals observe vows according to their abilities, it is appropriate for them to wear a single piece of cloth until the time of renunciation. ||

## Chapter 312:

175. The Adi Purana... There, after the immediate cessation of the family, the ten rights of a twice-born are established by the creator. 

176. These are: Atibal Vidya, Kulavadhi, Varnottamatva, Patratva, Srishti Adhikarita, Vyavhareshita, Avadhyatva, Adandayata, Manarhata, and Prajasambandhanta, in order.

177. These ten rights are mentioned in the Upasaka Sangraha. I will briefly explain them here according to their names.

178. The effort to teach knowledge to a twice-born from childhood is called Atibal Vidya. This is considered very auspicious for the twice-born.

179. If this Atibal Vidya is absent, the twice-born becomes foolish, unable to discern the worthy and unworthy. He is deceived by those who falsely claim to be twice-born and falls into the study of false scriptures.

180. Therefore, it is proper for the twice-born to study the scriptures of Shravaka-achara from childhood. By acquiring good conduct through these scriptures, he becomes capable of liberating himself and others.

181. Protecting the customs of one's family is called Kulavadhi for the twice-born. If one fails to protect the customs of his family, all his actions are destroyed, and he falls into another family.

182. Being superior to all other classes is the Varnottama action. Through this Varnottama action, he attains praise and becomes capable of liberating himself and others.

183. If one does not have this Varnottama action, that is, if his class is not superior, then he cannot be excellent. And one who is not excellent cannot purify himself or others.

184. Therefore, a twice-born who desires purity must serve other Kulangas or Kubrahmanas. By doing so, he undoubtedly acquires the faults that arise from them. Meaning: One should always act in a way that does not hinder the superiority of one's class.

185. Due to the importance of qualities, the right to receive donations also belongs to these twice-born. For one who is superior in qualities is worshipped by all in the world, even by those who are worshipped by the world.

186. Therefore, the twice-born should strengthen their right to receive donations through their qualities. If they lack these qualities, they will be deprived of wealth by the king due to their lack of respect.

## Chapter Forty

### 313

**187.**  The **Dvija** (twice-born) should protect the authority of their own **Srishti** (creation) and stay far away from the **Srishti** created by the **Asadrishti** (those with false vision).

**188.** Otherwise, the **Kudrishti** (those with evil vision) will mislead the people and kings with their corrupt **Srishti** doctrine, leading them astray.

**189.** Therefore, the **Dvija** who knows the truth and the right path should reject the other **Srishtis** and promote the **Dharma Srishti** (righteous creation) established by the **Anadi Kshatriyas** (eternal warriors).

**190.** This **Dharma Srishti** was created by the **Tirthankaras** (spiritual leaders) and is eternal. Those who take refuge in it should be enlightened about the true nature of **Srishti**.

**191.** Otherwise, the **Dvija** and the kings will embrace the **Srishti** created by others, leading to the loss of their **Aishwarya** (prosperity) and the **Arahantas** (liberated souls) will be affected.

**192.** The **Dvija** who takes refuge in the **Param Agam** (supreme scriptures) and has the freedom to perform **Prayaschitta** (atonement) and other rituals is called **Vyavhareshita**.

**193.** In the absence of **Vyavhareshita**, the **Dvija** cannot purify himself or others. If he is impure and tries to purify himself through others, he will never become **Kriti** (worthy).

**194.** The **Dvija** with a stable mind is **Avadhya** (not to be killed) even in the context of the right to kill. The **Brahmana** (priest) is not worthy of being killed by anyone due to his superior qualities.

**195.** All beings should not be killed, especially **Brahmanas**. There are two types of violence based on the superiority and inferiority of qualities.

**196.** Therefore, the **Dvija** should uphold his **Avadhyata** (inviolability) among the righteous. This is the true greatness of **Dharma** that one who resides in it is not overcome by anyone.

**197.** If he does not uphold his **Avadhyata**, he will become **Vadhya** (worthy of being killed) by everyone. In such a situation, the authority of **Dharma** will be greatly diminished. 

Page #332:

Adipurana
Therefore, the eternal Dharma should be protected with all efforts. For, when protected, it protects the movable and immovable. ||198||
Similarly, this Dharma, whose soul is stable, has the right to be free from punishment. For, the person who is established in Dharma is the master in administering punishment to others. ||199||
Therefore, the righteous king, contemplating the teachings of Yama, as shown by the Dharma-seers, punishes the wicked. ||200||
Just as the wealth of gods and gurus is to be avoided by those who seek their own good, so also the wealth of a Brahmin is to be avoided. Therefore, a Brahmin is not worthy of punishment. ||201||
By this reasoning, he, who is self-controlled, establishes himself in the position of being free from punishment, by imputing to himself an abundance of qualities in the presence of those who administer punishment. ||202||
For, in the absence of this right, he will be punished like others. And then, having become destitute, he will not be happy in this world or the next. ||203||
His right to be honored is his inherent worthiness of honor. For, he who is superior in qualities is worthy of being honored, worshipped, and revered by the best. ||204||
In the absence of this right to be honored, he will not be honored by the wise. And then, due to the lack of position, honor, and other benefits, he will fall from his position. ||205||
Therefore, let the Brahmins impute to themselves these qualities (qualities of being worthy of honor) with great effort. And let the kings strive to acquire knowledge, character, and other virtues. ||206||
This is the quality called "Praja-sambandhanta" (quality of relationship with other communities), which prevents him from falling from his high position, even when he has relationships with other communities. ||207||
Just as gold mixed with iron loses its luster, so also his own excellence of qualities does not diminish due to his relationship with others. ||208||

Page #333:
---------------------------
The fortieth chapter, however, is connected with the interaction of people, and it brings forth its own qualities. Just as a substance brings forth the qualities of gold, so does this [Brahmin] bring forth its own qualities. [206] Therefore, this quality is the greatest, the one that illuminates the effect of Dharma. By this, this [Brahmin] is able to bring others under its control through its own qualities. [210] If this quality is not present, then the Brahmin may lose its own qualities through interaction with others. If this quality is present, then the Brahmin's excellence will be revealed. [211] Therefore, the Brahmin who accepts the tenfold regulations, such as the study of the Vedas, in their true sense, will be respected by all. [212] There are other special qualities in these qualities, which are worthy of being discussed at length. These should be understood in detail from the teachings of the Upasaka. [213] Thus, while describing the method of the practice of vows, the ten authorities have been established by the Brahmins of good conduct, in connection with the mantras appropriate for the action. [214] In this context, one should know the action-mantras that have been described earlier. The seven mantras of the Peethika are considered to be general in nature. [215] These are common mantras, used in all actions. Therefore, those who know mantras call them general mantras. [216] The special mantras are shown in the action-hymns. From here onwards, the Brahmins should understand these mantras according to their own tradition. [217] He who uses these mantras appropriately in actions, will be a Brahmin of good conduct, respected in the world. [218] Those who are devoid of action-mantras do not succeed in their endeavors, just as an army without a commander is defeated. [219]

## Adipurana, Chapter 40: Description of Rituals and Mantras in the Origin of Brahmanas

**Verse 220:** Having understood the proper method from the Adipurana, those who have studied the scriptures should perform rituals with mantras, as prescribed by the scriptures.

**Verse 221:** Thus, the victorious king Bharata, who is adept in religious practices and beloved of Dharma, established the lineage of Brahmanas, having properly instructed those virtuous Brahmanas, in the presence of the people.

**Verse 222:** These Brahmanas, who have received respect from King Bharata, are renowned for their beautiful and generous character, their knowledge of the scriptures, and their adherence to the teachings of Jinavrishabha. They are highly respected in the world and have achieved great fame.

**Verse 223:** Having established these Brahmanas, the jewel of the Ikshvaku dynasty, King Bharata, honored them daily, seeing them firmly established in the Jain path. Seeing his own creation, accomplished with joy and excellence, who among the virtuous would not consider themselves fulfilled?

The Forty-fourth Chapter

Now, after some time had passed, Chakravarti Bharat had some wondrous dreams.  ||1||  Seeing these dreams, he felt a little troubled in his mind.  He woke up suddenly and began to ponder the fruits of these dreams.  ||2||  These dreams seem to bring me bad fruits, mostly.  I think they will bear fruit in the distant future, in the fifth Kalpa.  ||3||  How is it possible for such calamities to befall the people while the Lord Vrishabhadeva is shining brightly?  ||4||  Therefore, perhaps when this Krita Yuga (fourth Kalpa) has passed and when there is an abundance of sin, these dreams will bear their fruit.  ||5||  These dreams, whose fruit is to spread chaos at the end of the Yuga, are harbingers of misfortune and bring common fruit to both the king and the people.  ||6||  Just as the fruit arising from the changes in the discs of the moon and the sun are borne by all beings in the world, so too will the fruits of the dreams I have seen be borne by all beings in common.  ||7||  This is our inference, a contemplation of gross matters.  The perception of subtle truth can only be attained through direct knowledge.  ||8||  There is no other than the sun of Kevala Jnana that can pierce the darkness of doubt.  For who, other than the sun, can destroy the darkness of night?  ||9||  With the Lord Vrishabhadeva, who reveals the true nature of things, present, why should I have confusion in my mind?  With a mirror present, who would see the beauty of the face by touch?  ||10-11||  Therefore, in this matter, seeing the auspicious sight of the Lord's face, we are justified in determining the truth of the dreams and in performing the rites of peace.  ||11||  Moreover, the fact that I have been the first to experience this, the creation of the world of the twice-born, should also be reported to the Lord's feet.  ||12||

## The Adipurana

**13.**  "The wise should be seen daily, their advice on good and bad sought, and they should be worshipped with great reverence, for they are the best of the best."

**14.**  Reflecting thus within himself, King Bharata arose from his bed in the second half of the night.  Having performed his morning rituals,

**15.**  He stood for a moment in the assembly hall, surrounded by kings, and prepared to go to pay homage to the Lord.

**16.**  Surrounded by a limited number of crowned kings who had risen with him, and endowed with great splendor, he set out to pay homage.

**17.**  Then, accompanied by his army, the Emperor quickly reached the destination where the World Teacher resided.

**18.**  Seeing the ground of the Jina's assembly from afar, the Lord of Treasures bowed, his hands joined in a lotus bud, his head lowered.

**19.**  Having circumambulated the outer part of the assembly ground, the King of Men entered, crossing various enclosures.

**20.**  He observed the Manastambha, the Great Chaitya Tree, the Siddhartha Tree, and the stupas adorned with offerings, and passed by them.

**21.**  He saw the rows of four types of trees, the flags, and the mansions, and passed through each enclosure, observing them.

**22.**  In each enclosure, he heard the songs and dances of the celestial women, and his mind was filled with joy, yet he maintained perfect composure.

**23.**  Then, through the lofty gateway of the Gopura, he entered the assembly ground, adorned with the Sri Mandap, where the Ganadharas resided.

**24.**  He ascended the first platform of the three-tiered seat and circumambulated it, worshipping the Dharmachakras.

Having reached the fragrant hut, the wheel-bearing one, who had conquered the three worlds, entered the second of the Mekhalas, the one with the great banner. ||25|| Seeing the Lord, who was worshipped by the gods, demons, Gandharvas, Siddhas, and Vidyadharas, Bharata, filled with devotion, bowed down. ||26|| Praising the Lord with hymns and worshipping him according to the rules, he sat down in his place, thirsty for the nectar of Dharma. ||27|| Bowing down to the lotus feet of the Lord with devotion, Bharata's body became so pure that he attained the knowledge of the past, present, and future at that very moment. ||28|| Having then drunk the nectar of Dharma, he became completely satisfied and declared his heart's desire to the Lord in a loud voice. ||29|| "O Lord, I have created Brahmanas who follow the path of the teachings of the Sutra, the path of the teachings of the Sutra, and the path of the teachings of the Sutra, and who are skilled in the conduct of the Shravakas. ||30|| O Lord, I have given them eleven Yajnopaveetas, from one to eleven, as marks of vows, according to the division of the qualities of the earth. ||31|| O Lord, you are the one who has created the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the entire world, the

(38) A pond with a dry center and abundant water at the edges, a heap of gems dulled by dust, a dog eating offerings meant for worship.

(39) A young bull, the moon with its halo, two bulls whose beauty is fading, their bodies touching.

(40) The sun, like a jewel adorning a woman, veiled by clouds, a dry tree without shade, a pile of old leaves.

(41) O best of the wise, I saw these sixteen dreams last night. Please dispel the doubts I have about their meaning.

(42) Though the king of treasures, Bharat, was skilled in interpreting dreams, he asked the Jina to explain them for the benefit of the assembly.

(43) As Bharat's question ended, the Jina, the world teacher, began to explain, his words like nectar, pleasing the entire assembly.

(44) The assembly, eager to hear the meaning of the Jina's divine words, seemed to be absorbed in meditation or a painting.

(45) "Well done, my son, well done. You have done well to worship the righteous twice-born. But there is a flaw in this, listen carefully.

(46) O long-lived one, the householders you created will follow the right path as long as the fourth age (Krita Yuga) lasts.

(47) But when the Kali Yuga arrives, they will be corrupted by pride in their caste and will deviate from the path of liberation.

(48) Filled with pride in their caste, they will think, "We are superior to others." They will deceive people with false scriptures, hoping for wealth.

(49) These Brahmanas, puffed up with pride due to the benefits of their position and blinded by false ego, will deceive people by creating false scriptures.

##  Chapter 322

**62.** O Kalyāṇāṅga, since you are undoubtedly presided over by the gods, these dreams of yours are not false. Understand their fruit from me.

**63.** You saw in a dream twenty-three lion kings roaming alone on this earth, having ascended the peak of a mountain. Understand clearly that the fruit of this is that, except for the great Lord Mahāvīra, there will be no rise of wicked doctrines in the time of the remaining twenty-three Tirthankaras.

**64.** This dream clearly indicates this fruit.

**65.** Then, in another dream, you saw a group of deer following a lone lion cub. This reveals that in the Tirtha of the great Lord Mahāvīra, there will be many Kulingīs who will embrace possessions.

**66.** Seeing a horse whose back is bent under the weight of a large elephant, it is known that the ascetics of the fifth age will not be able to bear all the qualities of austerity.

**67.** Some will be lazy in keeping their vows of the root and the subsidiary qualities, some will break them from the root, and some will become dull or indifferent.

**68.** Seeing a herd of goats eating dry leaves, it is known that in the future, men will abandon good conduct and become wicked.

**69.** Seeing monkeys climbing on the shoulders of a Gajaendra, it is known that in the future, the ancient Kshatriya lineage will be destroyed, and those of low lineage will rule the earth.

**70.** Seeing owls being harassed by crows, it is known that, desiring religion, men will abandon the Jain monks and go to the company of the ascetics of other sects.

**71.** Seeing many ghosts dancing, it is known that people will worship the Vyantaras as gods, due to causes like name and karma.

**72.** Seeing water filled around a pond whose middle part is dry, it is known that religion will leave the Āryakhaṇḍa and remain only in the Mleccha regions.

**73.** Seeing a heap of jewels soiled with dust, it is known that in the fifth age, there will be no excellent monks who possess ṛiddhis.

**74.** Seeing a beautiful vessel being honored with respect, it is known that the twice-born will receive respect for their worthy qualities.

## Forty-fourth Chapter

123. Seeing a young bull roaring loudly and roaming around indicates that people will attain the state of a monk only in their youth, not in other stages of life. ||75||

Seeing the moon surrounded by a halo indicates that the monks of the fifth age will not possess the knowledge of Avadhi and Manahparyaya. ||76||

Seeing two bulls moving together indicates that the monks of the fifth age will live together, not in solitary retreat. ||77||

Seeing the sun obscured by clouds indicates that the sun of Kevala Jnana will rarely rise in the fifth age. ||78||

Seeing a dry tree indicates that the character of men and women will become corrupt, and seeing withered leaves indicates that the essence of great medicines will be lost. ||79||

Consider these dreams as far-reaching, bearing fruit in the distant future. Therefore, there is no harm from them now, their effects will be felt in the fifth age. ||80||

O son, knowing the true fruits of these dreams from me, strengthen your mind in Dharma for the pacification of all obstacles. ||81||

Hearing the words of his Guru, Bharat, the protector of the four varnas and four ashramas, purified his mind, removing the mud of doubt. ||82||

He bowed repeatedly to the Lord and asked again and again. Pleased by the Guru's grace, he returned with great difficulty. ||83||

Then, entering Ayodhya, a city adorned with toranas and filled with rows of flags, where the people were joyfully welcoming him, he performed acts of peace to pacify the ill effects of the bad dreams. These acts included the consecration of the Jina, giving gifts to worthy recipients, and other virtuous deeds. ||84-85||

He irrigated the earth with the milk of cows, worshipped the great sages, gave great gifts, and pleased his loved ones. ||86||

Then, he had bells made, adorned with images of the Jinas, crafted from precious stones and tied with golden ropes. ||87|| 

Page #342:
---------------------------
324
In the Adipurana, it is said that many bells were made and hung at the city gates, as well as twenty-four bells at the main gate of the royal palace and at the Gopura gates, in sequence. ||87-88|| When the Chakravarti (universal monarch) would exit or enter through these gates, the bells attached to the crown would remind him of the twenty-four Tirthankaras. ||89|| Remembering them, he would then offer salutations to the Arhant Devas with devotion. Thus, the virtuous King Bharat, while exiting or entering, would worship the Arhant Devas. ||90|| The bells, connected to the Sutras (threads), were said to be of the Supreme Ones. They were well-crafted and beautiful, like the commentaries on the Sutras (Agamas). ||91|| The bells, adorned on the head of King Bharat, the jewel of the three worlds, shone brightly, like the shadow of the feet of the Jina. ||92|| The bells, established in the structure of the jeweled toranas (archways) by Bharat, the lord of treasures, for the purpose of honoring the Arhant Devas, inspired others to also honor them. Thus, people began to install bells in the toranas of their own homes. ||93-94|| From that time onwards, the citizens also hung bells, adorned with Jina images and other paraphernalia, in the toranas of their homes, according to their own wealth and status. ||95|| At that time, the people greatly revered the creation of the first King Bharat. This is why even today, one can see garlands of salutations in every home. ||96|| Since King Bharat had these garlands made for the purpose of honoring the Arhant Devas, they became known as "Vandanamala" and gained fame throughout the earth. ||97|| If the king is righteous, then the people will also be righteous. And if the king is not righteous, then the people will also not be righteous. This is the rule: as the king is, so are the people. ||98|| At that time, due to the influence of time, most people were righteous. This is because, during the reign of the virtuous King Bharat, everyone was engaged in their own welfare. ||99|| At that time, a good king and good people were both present together. Therefore, at the request of the king, the people...

## Forty-fourth Chapter

325. This king, being Dharma-priya, honored the Dharma-sthana. Thinking, "The whole world will then take delight in Dharma," he made them do so. ||10||

This victorious king, being virtuous, pure, and strong, made the people who were attached to their nature, respect Dharma-kriya. ||101||

"Bharata is devoted to Dharma, and we are his followers," thinking thus, the crowned kings followed his conduct. ||102||

This king, whose desires were fulfilled by the power of his Chakra, attained single-mindedness in Dharma, having achieved both wealth and desires. ||103||

Giving charity, performing worship, observing vows, and fasting on festival days, these four are the Dharma prescribed for householders. ||104||

He gave charity to the virtuous munis, with great respect, accompanied by nine kinds of punya and seven virtues. ||105||

He gave pure food, medicine as needed, and protection to all beings. This is the three-fold path of charity. ||106||

He increased his devotion to the Jinas, and took great delight in their worship, thinking, "By worshipping the worthy, one becomes worthy in the world." ||107||

He performed the supreme worship of the Chakra, by constructing Chaityas, Chaitya-alaya, etc., and by performing the great Yajna called Kalpa-vriksha. ||108||

His mind was always engaged in observing vows, for a vow, protected with effort, protects the soul. ||109||

Observing vows is called Sila, and the vows of householders, such as the vow of non-violence, have been described earlier with their characteristics. ||110||

He observed these vows, along with their भावना, as appropriate, and thus, being the protector of his people, he was considered the foremost among householders. ||111||

He observed the fast on the festival day, and with a calm mind, performed Samayika, and at that time, he... ||112||

He resided in the Jain temple and at that time he was following the conduct of the monks. ||112|| He was attaining peace in the remembrance of the Jina, his mind was becoming steady and it is surprising that due to the loosening of the bonds of his body, his ornaments were falling off. ||113|| Although he had to worry about many things, his concern for Dharma was very strong. It is right because when one thinks about Dharma, all things worthy of thought become thought of automatically. ||114|| All the actions of Bharat, who has attained many riches due to the rise of the great fruit-bearing virtuous deeds, were initiated only after thinking about Dharma. That is, Maharaja Bharat thought about Dharma at the beginning of all his actions. ||115|| When he opened his eyes in the morning and saw all the directions red with the morning glow, he thought that these directions were red only because of the redness of the lotus feet of the Jina. ||116|| Seeing the sun rising in the morning, having destroyed the dense darkness of the night, he got up thinking that it was the reflection of the Lord's Kevala Jnana. ||117|| In the morning, when the wind blew and the lotus flowers bloomed, he considered them in his heart to be as cool as the group of divine sounds of the Jina. ||118|| He was very religious, his concern for work and wealth was secondary, and his main purpose was in Dharma, which brings about all kinds of welfare. ||119|| He would get up in the morning and first think about Dharma with the righteous men, and then with his ministers he would consider wealth and the fulfillment of desires. ||120|| As soon as he got up from his bed, he would worship the gods and the gurus, and then, wearing auspicious attire, he would sit on the Dharma-asana. ||121|| There, he would spend a moment thinking about the good and bad conduct of the people, and then he would appoint the officials to their respective duties, that is, he would give them orders to do their work. ||122|| After that, he would go to the middle of the assembly hall and sit on the royal throne, and he would honor the kings who were seeking an opportunity to serve. ||123|| He would greet some kings with a look, some with a smile, and some he would please with gifts. ||124||

327. He honored and dismissed the great men and envoys who had come with gifts and messages, having fulfilled their purposes. ||125|| He also delighted the artists who had come to perform dances and other shows, by giving them great rewards. ||126|| Then, rising from the royal throne, he engaged in leisurely pursuits of his choice, accompanied by delicate amusements. ||127|| At midday, after bathing and taking his meal, he adorned himself. ||128|| The ladies of his household, approaching him, spontaneously offered him the services of waving the fly-whisk, presenting betel, and massaging his feet. ||129|| After his meal, he sat in a suitable hall with some kings, and engaged in discussions of knowledge with a group of learned men. ||130|| There, the courtesans and beloved wives of kings, intoxicated with the arrogance of youth, surrounded him. ||131|| He spent some time in that pleasant place, enjoying their conversation, banter, and humorous stories, along with the pleasures of the senses. ||132|| Then, in the remaining part of the day, he strolled about on the floor inlaid with jewels, admiring the magnificent beauty of the royal palace all around. ||133|| Sometimes, placing his hand on the shoulder of a jester-secretary, he walked about, shining like a divine prince. ||134|| At night, he performed the duties befitting an emperor, and spent the night happily, accompanied by his wives and ministers. ||135|| Even though he, the emperor, had accomplished his tasks, having achieved victory and fulfilled all his purposes, he still consulted with his ministers at appropriate times, considering it a matter of duty. ||136|| The emperor, who had conquered the earth, had no anxiety about the affairs of the kingdom. For, in this land of Bharat, anxiety about the kingdom is the burden only of those who are not independent. ||137|| 

Page #346:
---------------------------
## Adipurana

For the sake of fame, he conquered the entire earth. Those who were independent in this Bharat Kshetra, whether they were concerned about their own country or foreign countries, if they were not concerned, then they were only concerned about their own country, that is, their own country. || 137 ||

He practiced the six virtues to eliminate his ignorance, because when he was protecting the enemy-free earth, what was the use of discussing treaties, war, etc. || 138 ||

The highly learned Maharaja Bharat, with great enthusiasm, used to explain the four royal sciences of Anvikshiki, Trayi, Varta, and Dandniti to the princes. || 139 ||

Sometimes he would also inspect the treasures and jewels, because some of the treasures and jewels were in his treasury and some were in his army. || 140 ||

Sometimes he would refute all the disputes in the Dharma Shastra, revealing the opinion of the Sarvagna Deva. || 141 ||

He would remove the doubts of those who had doubts about the principles spoken by the Bhagwan Arhant Deva and make them understand the true nature of the principles. || 142 ||

Similarly, he displayed his complete mastery in the meaning of Arthashastra and in Kamashastra, so that there was no other clever person like him in this world. || 143 ||

Seeing the independence of Maharaja Bharat in Hastitantra and Asvatantra, those who knew these scriptures believed that he was the creator of the original scriptures of all these. || 144 ||

Regarding Ayurveda, everyone praised the lord of treasures, Bharat, without any doubt, saying that this long life is like a living Ayurveda, that is, Ayurveda has taken the form of Bharat. || 145 ||

Similarly, good people also believed that he was skilled in grammar, proficient in rhetoric, and a reflection of Chanda Shastra. || 146 ||

The science of omens was first created by him, the science of omens was spoken by him, and the knowledge of astrology was also created by him. || 147 ||

## Chapter 41

**18.** He was the cause of causes, the authority on the science of omens, the master of tantra, mantra, shakuna, and astrology. He was considered the supreme deity in the knowledge of fate. **149.** With his birth, all the auspicious signs of a great man were manifested. His body was cited as an example in other texts. **150.** Even those who were well-versed in other arts and sciences, upon seeing him, would abandon their doubts, considering him as a mirror. **151.** His innate wisdom, a legacy from his past lives, led him to achieve the highest level of knowledge in all disciplines. **152.** Thus, he gained recognition in all the scriptures and arts, becoming the authority on all knowledge. **153.** What more need be said? This man, a beacon of wisdom, became the architect of the entire world's conduct. **154.** He was a master of statecraft, a scholar of Dharma, and renowned for his knowledge of the arts. He was the epitome of wisdom, shining brightly among the learned. **155.** His first reign was truly remarkable. He was an emperor, the leader of the Rajarshis, and his universal sovereignty was equally awe-inspiring. His fame spread far and wide. **156.** Thus, he, the embodiment of all arts, the eternal friend of the wise, the Chakravarti among the learned, the Chakravarti of wisdom, whose banner of fame fluttered high, taught all knowledge in the assembly of the wise, expounding all disciplines.

* **Chakravarti:** A universal monarch, a king who rules over the entire world.

##  English Translation:

Remembering the unparalleled Dharma path ordained by the Jinas, the king Bharat, who had attained the truth himself, taught the path to others. With a mature mind, he protected the entire world, free from enemies. He enjoyed the pleasures of life for a long time, filled with essence. ||157||

The king Bharat, who possessed the sole dominion over the happiness arising from the union of Lakshmi and Saraswati, who had banished all evil policies, who radiated a peaceful brilliance, who had achieved the union of wealth and desire through righteous means, who was skilled in both weapons and scriptures, a king-sage of the highest excellence, was the foremost among those who served the Jinas. ||158||

Thus ends the forty-first chapter of the *Trishattilakshana Mahapurana Sangraha*, composed by the revered Jinasena Acharya, known as *Bharataraja Swapna Darshan Tatphala Uparnanam*, which narrates the dream of King Bharat and its consequences.

**In the midst of the assembly, Hari, seated on the throne, addressed the assembled kings, delivering a discourse on Kshatriya Dharma.** (1)

**"O noble Kshatriyas, the best among you, listen! You have been appointed by the Lord Vrishabhadeva, the Adi Brahma, to protect the suffering beings."** (2)

**"The Dharma of those appointed to protect the suffering beings is fivefold. Having heard this, you should act according to the scriptures for the welfare of the people."** (3)

**"This Dharma is fivefold, consisting of: protecting the lineage, protecting the intellect, protecting oneself, protecting the people, and maintaining justice."** (4)

**"Among these, protecting the lineage means protecting the lineage's traditions and upholding the conduct befitting the lineage."** (5)

**"Now, listen to how the lineage traditions of the Kshatriyas are established. This creation was created by the Lord Vrishabhadeva, the Adi Brahma, with the Kshatriyas as the first."** (6)

**"He, who had worshipped the three jewels in the previous existence, attained the state of a Tirthankara, and meditated on the sixteen auspicious thoughts, resided in the highest realm of heaven, the Sarvarthasiddhi."** (7-8)

**"From there, he descended to this Bharatavarsha, to establish the Dharma Tirtha. He then took an avatar and initiated the creation of the Kshatriyas."** (9)

**"How did this creation of Kshatriyas come about? The answer is that in this present age, which is the realm of karma, there are two types of beings. One type is those who need to be protected, and the other is those who are ready to protect."** (10)

**"Those who are ready to protect the beings are called Kshatriyas, and their lineage is called the Kshatriya lineage. This lineage is eternal, like a tree with its roots in the past, and its branches extending into the future."** (11)

### 333

**24.**  "Kings are Jains, and those who serve the feet of the Arhats are worthy of receiving their remaining offerings. This is because the destruction of their sins will occur."

**25.** "Born from the lineage of the first Kshatriya, the Jinas are embodiments of the Triratna. They are of the same lineage as these kings, and therefore, they should accept their remaining offerings."

**26.** "Just as a garland worn on the head of a guru is considered sacred by his disciples, so too, the garland and other adornments touched by the feet of the Jinas should be considered sacred by the kings."

**27.** "Some may question how kings can accept remaining offerings from the monks. But there is no doubt, for both the Rajarshis and the Paramarishis are of the same lineage."

**28.** "Those who are not Kshatriyas, but who have taken initiation and follow the right conduct, become Kshatriyas. Therefore, born under the influence of the Triratna, the monks are also considered Kshatriyas, just like the kings."

**29.** "From the above discussion, it is clear that those who follow a different path than Jainism are not entitled to receive remaining offerings from the Kshatriyas."

**30.** "Therefore, kings should always strive to protect their lineage. Otherwise, those who follow other paths will deceive them by preaching false scriptures."

**31.** "We have discussed the first duty, which is the protection of the lineage (Kulanupalan). Now, we will discuss the second duty, which is the protection of the mind (Mtyanupalan). The mind is the knowledge of what is beneficial and harmful, both in this world and the next."

**32.** "How can one protect the mind? The answer is by eliminating ignorance. False knowledge is called ignorance, and the belief in the unreal as real is called false knowledge."

**33.** "The teachings of the Arhats are the truth. By studying their teachings, one can eliminate the impurities of the mind."

Adipurana
A firm mind in the physical realm is attained by the knowledge of Rajavidya. A mind that is rooted in both this world and the next is attained by the knowledge of Dharma Shastra. ||34|| Those Kshatriyas who became great sages by producing Tirthankaras are called Mahadeva due to their greatness. ||35|| Those kings who were born in great lineages and who followed the path of the first Kshatriya, Lord Rishabhadeva, also attained the title of Mahadeva due to their greatness. ||36|| Their wives are also called Mahadevi due to their association with great men, being married to great men, and giving birth to great souls. ||37|| If someone who follows a different path were to say, "We are the Mahadeva, we are the saviors of the world, there is no one greater than our deity, and there is no religion greater than ours," after the Jains have established their own position in this way, then their heart is corrupted by false views. ||38|| But in this matter, we say that this is not the essence of the ocean of existence. The path that is the means of crossing it is the path taught by the Jinas. ||40|| Only an Arhat is an Aapta, because he is free from the defects of attachment, aversion, etc. Others are not Aapta, but only think they are, because they have no certainty about the greatness of their speech, soul, and fortune. ||41|| The Jina is Aapta, the Supreme Lord, the eternal soul, because he is endowed with the greatness of speech, etc., he is the benefactor of all, and he is the direct witness of all things. ||42|| One should know that his greatness of speech is such that he pleases the entire assembly with his single divine word. ||43|| Similarly, his greatness of soul is manifested by the complete destruction of the veils of knowledge, perception, delusion, and karmic obstacles, and by his proximity to infinite knowledge, perception, infinite bliss, and infinite power. ||44|| The attainment of eight types of Pratihariya, the creation of the Samavasarana, and the infinite perception of the past, present, and future are the greatness of his fortune. ||45||

It is possible that an Arhat is also one who has destroyed the veils of knowledge, perception, delusion, and karmic obstacles. Therefore, one should study the teachings of the Arhat to remove the impurities of one's mind. ||33|| 

Page #353:
---------------------------
335
The 42nd chapter is adorned with the extraordinary qualities of speech, which are not found in others. The Lord, the Arhat, the Supreme, the World Teacher, is the one who has achieved his goal. ||46|| There is no other man like him in any other doctrine. Therefore, by the exclusion of other yogas, he deserves to be called an "apta" (perfect). ||47|| Remembering this Kshatriya Dharma, which is approved by the "aptas", the Kshatriyas should separate their lineage from other doctrines. ||48|| By this conduct, which is not beneficial to the soul, one can protect one's intellect. And by protecting the intellect, the Kshatriya can protect the undivided earth. ||49|| To further clarify the nature of the above-mentioned substance, three examples are given here in order. ||50|| To illustrate one's own purpose, the first example is that of a man, the second is that of a bird, and the third is that of worldly beings. ||51|| One should know the example of a man, which is the example of a liberated soul, as the example that supports both liberation and bondage. ||52|| This worldly being, desiring to obtain happiness, strives to experience in the body, which is like a house, the knowledge, perception, strength, happiness, and beauty that arise from the senses. ||53|| But the liberated being does not do so. He continuously experiences supreme happiness, which is independent of the senses, through the above-mentioned transcendental qualities. ||54|| Among these, the worldly being who has sensory knowledge, being himself of limited knowledge, relies on other men who contemplate knowledge in order to gain knowledge of the scriptures. ||55|| Similarly, a man who has the power of sight through his senses can only see some objects that are close to him. Therefore, he is always eager to see distant objects. ||56|| A man who has strength arising from his senses desires to accomplish a desired task with the help of another, being unable to do it himself. ||57|| And a man who has sensory pleasure is completely absorbed in sensual pleasures, desiring happiness that is dependent on others and the enjoyment of sensual objects. ||58||

The Adipurana, as well as the beauty of the senses, desires to refine beauty with bathing, garlands, anointing, and ornaments. ||79|| Carrying the body, which is the abode of the senses, the place of the defects, the dhatus, and the malas, a man is always anxious about its protection through food, medicine, etc. ||60|| Seeing the defects like birth, death, etc., and being distressed by the body, when a thoughtful man tries to perform austerities with the desire to abandon it, he accepts the body, which is the abode of the senses, the happiness and lifespan associated with it, and finally, seeing it perish, desires another abode of the senses. ||61-62|| But he who has the offspring of transcendental knowledge, transcendental vision, transcendental strength, and transcendental happiness, and who is endowed with his own self-nature, body, abode, and beauty, is never touched by the aforementioned defects. Therefore, one should consider him who has transcendental knowledge, strength, and happiness as an "apt" (one who has attained liberation), and one who does not possess these qualities as "inapt" (one who has not attained liberation). ||63-64|| Now, we will explain the meaning of this sentence further, because until the meaning of a thing is clarified, its true knowledge is not obtained. ||65|| A person who has transcendental knowledge does not rely on the meaning of any other scripture, but he himself, possessing pure eyes of perfect knowledge and knowing all things in the three periods of time, teaches everyone. ||66|| Similarly, a being who has transcendental vision never desires to see an unprecedented thing, because he who sees all things simultaneously has no unseen thing. ||67|| A being who has infinite strength, which is the destroyer of karma, also does not seek the help of any other being, but...

## Forty-Second Chapter

337.

Even though the soul experiences transcendental bliss, it is not eager for worldly pleasures. It never experiences anxiety about objects of enjoyment. || 66 ||

Having attained transcendental beauty, one does not desire rituals like bathing, etc.  Because the soul is eternally pure, both externally and internally, it is already cleansed. || 70 ||

The body of the soul, which is transcendental, does not depend on food, etc. It is beyond the reach of hunger, disease, poison, weapons, and other afflictions. || 71 ||

Such a soul is not desirous of austerities, having transcended birth, old age, and death. It does not seek another abode, being content with its own self. || 72 ||

Such a soul, free from all impurities and endowed with all virtues, is called the Supreme Soul, the Supreme Light, the Supreme Lord. || 73 ||

One might argue that the ability to assume various forms at will (Kama-rupa) is a characteristic of a liberated soul. However, this is not true. A soul with desires (raga) would be a Kama-rupa, and such a soul would be unfulfilled. || 74 ||

One who is unable to attain his desired object through his natural form, how can he be happy by assuming a distorted form (Kama-rupa)? || 75 ||

This is an example from the human realm. Now, let us consider an example from the realm of birds.

Just as a bird confined in a cage cannot go to its desired place, similarly, a soul bound by karmic chains cannot reach its desired abode. || 76 ||

Just as a person freed from bondage in this world attains ultimate freedom, similarly, a soul freed from karmic bondage also attains freedom. || 77 ||

Just as a bird confined in a cage and a bird freed from the cage are considered the same, similarly, a soul bound by karma and a soul freed from karma are considered the same. || 78 ||

This is an example from the realm of birds. These two examples have been presented to clarify the nature of the liberated soul and the worldly soul. To further strengthen this understanding, let us consider an example from the realm of human beings. || 79 || 

Page #356:
---------------------------
## 338

The *Adipurana* states that the *samsari* (worldly being) is bound by dependence on others. This teaching, when applied to the liberated being, demonstrates their independence. ||8||

The *samsari* is an example of dependence, and this example reveals the independence of the liberated soul. ||81||

For example, the embodied being in the cycle of birth and death is never independent. Bound by karma, they live dependent on others. ||82||

This demonstrates the dependence of the *samsari*. Similarly, due to the experience of pain and suffering, this being is also fickle. ||83||

The agitation caused by pain and suffering is called fickleness. The loss of powers gained in the realm of gods, etc., indicates the perishable nature of this being. ||84||

The suffering inflicted upon this being, as well as the reception of unpleasant words, are signs of their bondage. Their knowledge, born of the senses, is perishable, and therefore finite. ||85||

Their perception is also finite, as it arises from the senses. Their vitality is also of the same nature, meaning finite, because their physical strength is very limited. ||86||

Their happiness, born of the senses, is also of this nature. The stain they bear due to the influence of karmic particles is their impurity. ||87||

They are also impure due to the connection with karmic impurities. Their bodies can be cut into pieces, indicating their vulnerability. ||88||

Their bodies can be shattered by a blow from a hammer, etc., indicating their fragility. The decline of their state is their old age, and the abandonment of their life force is their death. ||89||

They are limited, as they are confined to their finite body. Their existence in the womb, their infancy, and their difficult stay in the mother's womb are all examples of this. ||90||

Now, to solidify the above statement, an example of a *samsari* being should be given. ||79||

The statement about the dependence of *samsari* beings, when applied to the teaching of liberation, becomes an example of the independence of liberated beings. The meaning is that the description of the dependence of *samsari* beings inherently describes the independence of liberated beings, because the absence of dependence in *samsari* beings is the very definition of the independence of liberated beings. ||80||

In the opinion of the *Arhat* and the *Deva*, the example of a *samsari* is one that reveals the independence of liberated beings. ||81||

This example is further clarified: In the cycle of birth and death, this being is not independent in any way. Bound by karma, they live dependent on others. ||82||

This explains the dependence of the *samsari*. Similarly, due to the experience of pain and suffering, this being is also fickle. ||83||

The agitation caused by pain and suffering is called fickleness. The loss of powers gained in the realm of gods, etc., indicates the perishable nature of this being. ||84||

The suffering inflicted upon this being, as well as the reception of unpleasant words, are signs of their bondage. Their knowledge, born of the senses, is perishable, and therefore finite. ||85||

Their perception is also finite, as it arises from the senses. Their vitality is also of the same nature, meaning finite, because their physical strength is very limited. ||86||

Their happiness, born of the senses, is also of this nature. The stain they bear due to the influence of karmic particles is their impurity. ||87||

They are also impure due to the connection with karmic impurities. Their bodies can be cut into pieces, indicating their vulnerability

## Chapter 339: Transformation of Karma and Non-Karma

**91.** The state of being in the womb, or the transformation within the womb of karma and non-karma, is the dissolution of the previous body and the transition to another.

**92.** The agitation and disturbance of the mind, possessed by anger and other passions, leads to the diverse yogas of the being, and its transmigration through various births.

**93.** This is the cycle of existence for the being, its constant transformation through the four paths. The lack of permanence in knowledge and other qualities in each birth is called *asiddhata*.

**94.** For those bound by karma, their happiness, unhappiness, strength, food, body, and dwelling change, as do their knowledge, perception, happiness, and energy.

**95.** These transient states of being, which are found in those bound by karma, are not present in the liberated soul. All their states are imperishable.

**96.** The liberated soul's first state is its own inherent nature, free from dependence on external objects, due to the attainment of its true self.

**97.** The absence of suffering caused by external influences leads to their unwavering stability and profound depth. Their imperishable nature, free from decay, arises from the complete eradication of karma.

**98.** Their freedom from any obstruction by any being or non-being is their *anyabaddhatva*. Their infinite knowledge allows them to understand the purpose of the universe.

**99.** Their infinite vision enables them to perceive the essence of the universe. Their ability to remain unaffected by others is their infinite power.

**100.** Their lack of desire for objects of enjoyment is their infinite happiness. The absence of both merit and demerit is their *nirajastva*.

**101.** Their purity arises from the elimination of both external and internal impurities. There is no one in this world who is inherently pure and perfect from the beginning of time.

**102.** The transformation of the being's regions, due to the eradication of karmic impurities, is its *acchedya* (indestructible) nature. This eradication of karmic impurities also leads to its *abhedya* (impermeable) nature.

**103.** The liberated soul's *aksharattva* (imperishable nature) is considered to be free from decay. Its *aprameyatva* (incomprehensibility) is due to its inherent qualities, which are beyond human comprehension.

**60.** The body's ability to be perceived is its *prameyapana*. The state of a child suffering in the mother's womb is its *garbhavas*.

**91.** The transformation within the womb of karma and non-karma is its *garbhavas*. The transition from one body to another is its *vilinata*.

**92.** The agitation and disturbance of the mind, possessed by anger and other passions, is its *kshubhitatva*. The wandering through various births is its *vividha yoga*.

**93.** The constant transformation through the four paths is the being's *samsara-avas*. The lack of permanence in knowledge and other qualities in each birth is called *asiddhata*.

**94.** For those bound by karma, their happiness, unhappiness, strength, food, body, and dwelling change, as do their knowledge, perception, happiness, and energy.

**95.** These transient states of being, which are found in those bound by karma, are not present in the liberated soul. All their states are imperishable.

**96.** The liberated soul's first state is its own inherent nature, free from dependence on external objects, due to the attainment of its true self

The Adipurana states that the soul does not reside in the womb due to the absence of external and internal impurities. Due to the absence of karma and no-karma, there is no heaviness or lightness in it. ||10||

It remains in its own nature due to the praiseworthy qualities born from the soul, hence it is indestructible. It is never devoid of the qualities of the soul, hence it is inseparable. ||10||

The form of the body, which is imperishable and indestructible, is its ultimate limit, and it is the form of yoga of the soul. ||106||

Its eternal existence at the peak of the three worlds is its abode in the world, and the perfection of all human endeavors is its ultimate perfection. ||107||

What is the use of acquiring other objects for a liberated being who is adorned with all these qualities, including knowledge, etc.? Nothing. ||108||

This example of a worldly being proves the Supreme Soul, who is the master of himself and is not subject to anyone's rule. ||109||

The one whose greatness is revealed by these three examples is the omniscient. Wise men should follow the teachings of that omniscient. ||110||

Thus, the one who has seen all the traditions and contemplates the evil in other doctrines through reasoning is considered the best among all Kshatriyas. ||111||

A Kshatriya should protect his awakened intellect by diverting it from other directions, i.e., doctrines, and placing it on the right path. ||112||

Protecting the soul from the dangers of this world and the next is called the protection of the soul. Now we will describe this protection of the soul. ||113||

Protection from dangers of this world, such as poison, weapons, etc., is well understood by the wise. ||114||

## The Thirty-Fourth Chapter

**341.** The method of protection from worldly and otherworldly calamities is now being explained. Protection from such calamities can only be achieved through Dharma, as Dharma is the antidote to all misfortunes. **115.** Dharma protects from calamities, Dharma grants desired results, Dharma leads to welfare in the otherworldly realm, and Dharma brings happiness in this world. **116.** Therefore, one should be steadfast in Dharma and engage in the counteraction of future calamities. Only then can the soul be protected from calamities in the next birth. **117.** A kingdom where sons and siblings are constantly at war and where there are many calamities should be abandoned by wise men. **118.** Moreover, how can one find happiness in a kingdom filled with mental anguish? Wise men consider freedom from mental distress as true happiness in this world. **119.** There is no trace of happiness in a kingdom that is destined for destruction and where sins constantly arise. On the contrary, a person who is constantly apprehensive experiences great suffering in such a kingdom. **120.** Therefore, wise men should abandon this kingdom, which is like an unhealthy medicine, and embrace austerity, which is like wholesome food. **121.** Thus, a wise person should renounce worldly pleasures and attachments to the kingdom beforehand, becoming detached. If unable to do so, they should at least renounce the pomp and show of the kingdom at the end. **122.** When the time of death is known by those who know the signs of time, or when it is determined by oneself, a wise person should then embrace the thought of relinquishing the body, that is, they should engage in Sallekhana. **123.** For renunciation is the supreme Dharma, renunciation is the supreme austerity. Renunciation brings fame in this world and great prosperity in the next. **124.** With this understanding, a king should renounce the body, food, and the kingdom with all its paraphernalia, in a sacred place, after performing the rituals of worship.

Adipurana
The attainment of desired Siddhi for such a great soul, who has renounced the body and food in the presence of the Guru, is dependent on conquering the Pariṣahas. ||126|| Therefore, a skilled person should contemplate on the Anuprekṣās to conquer the Pariṣahas. Without contemplating on the Anuprekṣās, it is difficult to attain peace of mind. ||127|| "I contemplate on the Samyaktvādi, which I have not contemplated before, and I do not contemplate on the Mithyātvaādi, which I have contemplated before." One should contemplate on the essence of the Tattvas with such thoughts. ||128|| One should renounce the non-self, such as the body and other possessions, and embrace the self, the three supreme jewels. ||129|| A wise and courageous person should contemplate in such a way that the fickleness of the mind is destroyed. At the end of life, one should renounce the breath while remembering the five Supreme Beings. ||130|| Such a person, who renounces the breath with devotion, attains a good destiny by loosening the karmas. ||131|| The capable one attains liberation in the same existence by destroying the karmas, while the incapable one attains the highest part of heaven, the Sarvārthasiddhi. ||132|| From there, he falls down and attains the human existence again. He performs the highest penance and at the end of life, he attains Nirvana by destroying all karmic bonds. ||133|| A Kshatriya who does not know the nature of the soul and does not protect his soul, will surely meet an untimely death due to poison, weapons, etc. ||134|| And the one who dies an untimely death falls into this cycle of existence, which is full of suffering and difficult to cross. He becomes a recipient of the suffering of the bad destinies in the afterlife. ||135|| Therefore, a wise Kshatriya should make a great effort to protect the soul from these obstacles, which benefits both worlds. ||136|| In this way, a king who has protected his soul should strive to protect his subjects, for this is the fundamental quality of kings. ||137||

1. Samyaktvādi etc.
2. Mithyātvaādi etc.
3. To destroy the mental obstacles.
4. One who has attained concentration.

6. Effort to protect the subjects.

How should these subjects be protected? We will explain this in detail by taking the example of a cowherd. || 138 ||

Just as a cowherd protects his cows without any laziness, so should a king protect his subjects with great effort. || 139 ||

For example, if a cow commits an offense in the herd, the cowherd does not punish her with severe punishment like amputation, but controls her with appropriate punishment. Just as the cowherd protects his cows, so should the king protect his subjects. || 140-141 ||

It is certain that a king who gives severe punishment makes his subjects more anxious, therefore the subjects abandon such a king and even the ministers and other natural people become disgusted with such a king. || 142 ||

Just as a cowherd, by protecting the main group of animals in his herd, becomes prosperous, because by protecting the cows, this man can become the owner of vast wealth, similarly, a king, by protecting his main class primarily, attains prosperity in his own and other kingdoms. || 143-144 ||

The excellent king, who is strong with his own main force, conquers this earth, which extends to the ocean, without any effort. || 145 ||

If, by chance, a cow's leg breaks due to negligence, the cowherd joins that leg with the help of tying and other methods, keeps the cow tied, gives grass to the tied cow, and tries to strengthen her leg. Similarly, he quickly retaliates against other calamities. || 146-147 ||

Just as the cowherd tries to protect his dependent cows, so should the king, in his army, provide the wounded warrior with the best medicine from the best physician and protect him from his misfortune. || 148 ||

And when that warrior becomes well, the king should think about giving him a good livelihood, because by doing so, the servants will always be happy. || 149 || 

Page #362:

Adipurana
Just as a cowherd, when a cow's bone is dislocated at the time of the evening milking, would set the bone back in place and provide appropriate treatment, so too should a king, when a chief servant dies in battle, appoint his son or brother to that position. [150-151] By doing so, the servants will become attached to the king, thinking, "This king is very grateful," and they will become steadfast warriors. [152] Just as a cowherd, when a cow in the herd is bitten by an insect, would give it appropriate medicine and provide treatment, so too should a king, when he knows that one of his dependents is poor or disheartened, make him happy. [153-154] For a dependent who does not receive proper livelihood will become detached from his master due to this disrespect, so the king should never make his dependent detached. [155] Knowing that the poverty of a dependent is like an insect breeding in a wound, the king should quickly provide a remedy. [156] Even with a lot of wealth, dependents will not be as satisfied as they are when they receive proper respect from their master. [157] Just as a cowherd, knowing that a large bull in his herd is capable of carrying a heavy load, would perform nasal medication and other things to strengthen its body, so too should a wise king, knowing that a warrior in his army is excellent, honor him by giving him a good livelihood. [158-159] A king who keeps those who have shown their valor satisfied with appropriate honors will never be abandoned by his dependents. [160] Just as a cowherd, with great effort, grazes his herd of cattle in a forest free of thorns and stones, and free from the troubles of cold and heat, 

Page #363:

## The Thirty-Fourth Chapter

**345** The king should nourish his subjects in a place free from disturbances, and having established his people in his own country, he should protect them. ||16||

**163** Otherwise, in the event of a change in the kingdom, etc., the people will be oppressed by thieves, robbers, and other enemies. ||163||

**164** The king should forcibly destroy the livelihood of such thieves, robbers, etc., for the welfare of the people can only be achieved by removing thorns. ||164||

**165-167** Just as a cowherd keeps a newly born calf with its mother for one day, and then, out of compassion, ties a rope to its leg and ties it to a peg on the second day, carefully removes its umbilical cord and placenta, protects it from the fear of insects, and nourishes it daily by giving it milk and other means, ||165-167||

**168-169** so too, the king should accept a servant who has come to serve him for his livelihood with due respect and honor, and should consider the welfare and prosperity of such servants who have been accepted and who endure hardship for him, and should provide them with what they lack and protect what they have. ||168-169||

**170-171** Just as a cowherd, eager to determine the quality of animals, examines them by observing their milk, etc., and buys the most excellent ones when he is ready to buy cattle, so too, the king should buy well-examined sons of noble families. ||170-171||

**172** And the king should employ those servants who have been bought with the price of their livelihood in suitable tasks according to the occasion, for the fruit of that work can only be achieved by servants. ||172||

**173** Just as a guarantor is appointed for the purchase of animals, so too, a strong man should be appointed as a guarantor in the gathering of servants. ||173||

**174** Just as a cowherd, getting up diligently in the night when only one watch remains, drives the cows to a place with abundant grass and water, ||174||

The 42nd chapter: We, the Dev Brahmanas, are the saviors of the world, and we are accepted by all. If they say, "We will not give you the proper share of grain," then ask them, "What makes you special compared to the other Varnas?" If they say, "We are special because of our caste," then that is not true, because caste-based superiority is not experienced. If they say, "We are special because of our qualities," then that is also not true, because you are only name-holders. The Jain Brahmanas who follow their vows are the ones who are superior in qualities. You are without vows, unworthy of worship, cruel, killers of animals, and followers of Mlechcha customs. Therefore, you cannot be considered righteous Dwijas. For all these reasons, the kings should consider these Dwijas as Mlechchas and take the proper share of grain from them like they do from ordinary people. Or, what is the point of saying more? Other than the Jain Dwijas, who follow their vows, no other Dwijas who live like ordinary people are worthy of respect by the kings.

Just as a cowherd protects his cattle from tigers, thieves, and other dangers without laziness, so too should the king protect his people. Just as a cowherd, desiring to see the cattle, goes to the king with offerings and pleases him with wealth, so too, if a powerful king comes to his kingdom, he should consult with the elders and make a treaty with him by giving him something. Because war leads to the destruction of many people, it causes many losses, and its future is also bad, therefore, it is better to make a treaty with a powerful enemy by giving him something. Thus, the king should accept the example of the cowherd and protect his people with wisdom.

The protection of the people is said to be the duty of the king who has conquered his senses. Now we will speak of another virtue, Samanjasatva. ||168||
The king, having calmed his mind, should engage in the suppression of the wicked and the protection of the righteous. This is called Samanjasatva. ||169||
He who punishes both the enemy and the son, who is impartial, who desires the good of both the wicked and the friend, and who, remaining neutral, looks upon all with an equal eye, is called Samanjas. And to look upon the people with an equal eye, without partiality, is the virtue of Samanjasatva of the king. ||200-201||
By this virtue of Samanjasatva, the king should protect the righteous who earn their livelihood justly and suppress the wicked who commit offenses. ||202||
Those who are engaged in sins like violence, etc., are called wicked, and those who are devoted to virtues like peace, purity, etc., and to Dharma, are called righteous. ||203||

**349** The most excellent character of the Kshatriyas of the lineage and the character of the Tirthankara Kshatriyas, revealed through the three jewels, which was narrated by the foremost of the Chakravartins, Maharaja Bharata, all this was expounded by the Lord Vaachapati (Shruta Kevali) Gautama Ganadhara, revealing the essence of all things, for the king of Magadha, Shrenik. ||206||

The time, filled with continuous festivals, passed pleasantly for the king of Bharata, who worshipped the feet of the Lord Vrishabhadeva, the master of the three worlds, who remembered the qualities of the Supreme Brahman, who bowed to the first Jina, and who, with devotion, repeatedly worshipped the Lord Vrishabhadeva, the guru of the gods and demons. ||207||

The emperor Bharata, who regularly worshipped the Jina, who daily pleased the assembly of seekers, who was constantly served by kings with crowns bowed to the earth, and who protected the entire earth, free from enemies, from the sea to the Himalayas, enjoyed the tenfold essence of pleasures through delightful pastimes of his own choosing. ||208||

Thus ends the forty-second chapter of the Trishattilakshana Mahapurana Sangraha, composed by the Acharya Bhagavan Jinaseena, known as Aarsha, which expounds the practice of the Varna Ashrama for the king of Bharata. ||42||

**Notes:**

* **Vaachapati (Shruta Kevali):** A title for a Jina who has attained omniscience through knowledge.
* **Tirthankara Kshatriyas:** Kshatriyas who have become Tirthankaras (spiritual leaders).
* **Three Jewels:** Right Faith, Right Knowledge, and Right Conduct.
* **Varna Ashrama:** The system of social and spiritual duties based on caste and stage of life.

[Uttarakhand] Chapter Thirty-Three

May the glorious Vrishabha, with the bull as his banner, grant us prosperity. He whose single departure became a great path of liberation. [1]

He whose steps are worshipped by Indra, who conquered the power of the cycle of karma, and by the wheel of Dharma, became the emperor of the three worlds. [2]

He who, like the sun at the beginning of the day, arose at the beginning of the fourth age, illuminated the world with his radiant words, the essence of divine sound. [3]

He who, in the eighteen kotis of oceans of the ascending and descending ages, when the path of liberation was lost, pointed it out and increased the number of Siddhas. [4]

He who, among the Tirthankaras, was never touched by the defeat of name-giving, just as Bharat Chakravarti was not touched by the defeat of name-giving in the Chakravartis. [5]

By his illumination of the path of liberation, the illumination of the path of liberation by others became redundant. [6]

_Thus, may Sri Vrishabha Deva, who bears the inner and outer Lakshmi, whose banner has the symbol of the bull, and whose single departure became a great path of liberation, grant us all well-being. [1]_

_Indra himself worships his lotus feet, and he, by the wheel of Dharma, conquered the power of the cycle of karma and became the emperor of the three worlds. [2]_

_He arose at the beginning of the fourth age, like the sun at the beginning of the day, and illuminated the entire world with his radiant words, the essence of divine sound. [3]_

_He, in the eighteen kotis of oceans of the ascending and descending ages, when the path of liberation was lost, pointed it out and increased the number of Siddhas. [4]_

_Just as Bharat Chakravarti was not touched by the defeat of name-giving in the Chakravartis, so too, he was not touched by the defeat of name-giving among the Tirthankaras. Meaning: Just as Bharat was the first Chakravarti in this age, so too, he was the first Tirthankara in this age. [5]_

_By his illumination of the path of liberation, the illumination of the path of liberation by others became redundant. Meaning: The path of liberation that is being followed now was first taught by Lord Vrishabha Deva. Other Tirthankaras who came after him also taught the same path, so their teachings seem redundant. [6]_

*It is noteworthy that Acharya Gunabhadra has written that Lord Vrishabha Deva arose at the beginning of the fourth age, even though he was born at the end of the third age and attained liberation in the third age. *

He who carried the burden of the Yuga (age) on his shoulders, and for a long time drove the great chariot of Dharma, filled with the virtues of vows and conduct, was indeed a wondrous sight. ||7|| Contemplating that one, the single syllable, like the imperishable syllable, I shall speak, having considered the objectives, the essence of that Purana. ||8|| All the rasas (emotions) are used by our own Guru, Jinaseanacharya, and we shall use only those rasas that he has left out, with devotion. ||9|| Those who compose Puranas, having abandoned raga (attachment) and the like, far away, and having described the rasas like Shringar (love), are pure knowers, pure seekers of liberation. ||10|| The essence of this Purana has been fully elaborated by the great soul, Jinaseanacharya. The effort of those who are striving in the remaining part of it should be understood as the effort to complete a remaining part of a building. ||11|| In this Purana, which is full of profound words and meanings, and adorned with excellent leaves and fruits, my words are like new leaves, so let the wise people hold them to their ears. Meaning: Just as people hold new leaves of a tree to their ears, so let the wise people hold these words of mine to their ears, i.e., listen to them with affection. ||12|| The first part of this Purana is made up of the Guru, i.e., Jinaseanacharya, or the long verses, and the latter part is made by the disciple (Gunabhadra), who is different from the Guru, or the short verses, so will it not be as beautiful as a verse? i.e., it will be. Meaning: Just as a verse made up of long and short verses is very beautiful, so this Purana, made by the Guru and the disciple, will also be very beautiful. ||13|| 'Just as the first part of sugarcane is juicy, so let the first part of this Purana also be juicy', with this thought, I begin the composition of its latter part. ||14|| Do not seek for excellence in me, but accept this as Dharma, for those who eat, sweet words are like food. ||15||

Or, it is certain that the beginning of this Purana will not be tasteless, because no one has ever seen the beginning of Dharma as tasteless. || 16 ||

If my words are sweet, then one should understand that this is the greatness of the Gurus, because the sweet fruits are the effect of the trees. || 17 ||

Since words come from the heart, and my Gurus reside in my heart, they will surely imbue my words with their qualities, i.e., they will refine them. Therefore, I will not have to exert any effort in creating this text. || 18 ||

This Purana is meant for those who desire to listen, its meaning has been spoken by the Jinesvara, and the words that convey it are present. Therefore, there is no fault (criticism) in it. || 19 ||

The virtuous people accept even faults as virtues, and the faulty people accept even virtues as faults. This is the strange greatness of right knowledge and wrong knowledge in this world. || 20 ||

It is right for a virtuous person to become virtuous by accepting the virtues of the virtuous. But it is astonishing that a wicked person becomes wicked by accepting non-existent faults. || 21 ||

In this world, a wicked person is worthy of anger from the virtuous, because they are the enemies of the wicked, and the refuge of the orphaned virtues. || 22 ||

Just as the great poets are worthy of praising those who follow their path, similarly, even the bad poets are worthy of criticizing me because I do not follow their path. || 23 ||

Only a poet can understand the effort of a poet in composing poetry, just as a barren woman cannot understand the pain of childbirth, similarly, a non-poet cannot understand the effort of a poet. || 24 ||

O wicked one, if there are any faults in this text of mine, then you take them, because they are your wealth, and you are not prohibited from them. But you have begged me for virtues, and I have not given them to you. || 25 ||

##  Verse 354

**354**
A criticism or praise made by one who does not know the qualities and defects is merely for laughter, like that of a blind man. ||26||
Or, even if he is ignorant, let him criticize or praise the work. Otherwise, there will be no rest for the witty. ||27||
Great men do not count petty troubles as much as small things. Straw can be burned by fire, but water cannot be heated by it. ||28||
Fire, born of wood, burns wood, but wood increases it. These two, like lamps, illuminate the nature of good and bad. ||29||
Having heard the praise and criticism of the work, let him make a judgment of its qualities and defects. They will make his fame, even if he is not a good maker. ||30||
Like the arrows of the great archer Arjuna, the words are well-aimed. Reaching the ill-cultured Karna, they pierce the heart deeply. ||31||
This work has been created by honoring the great poets of the past. May the present and future poets purify it with their grace. ||32||
My mind only gives birth to this work, like a queen to a daughter. The minds of the great poets, like nurses, will nurture it. ||33||
Wise men will understand this, let not ordinary people understand it. What can poor people buy with their meager wealth? ||34||
Let the best of men, holding the great jewel of Dharma, born from the ocean of Agamas, consider it greater than the Kaustubha gem and keep it in their hearts. ||35||

**Meaning:**

The author humbly requests the reader not to focus on his personal qualities. He believes that focusing on the flaws of the work will make it more appealing to everyone, while focusing on the author's qualities will make it less appealing. Therefore, he encourages the reader to focus on the flaws of the work, as it will be beneficial to the reader.

The verses use various metaphors and similes to illustrate the author's point. He compares the work to a lamp that illuminates the nature of good and bad, and the author's words to the arrows of Arjuna that pierce the heart of the ill-cultured. He also compares the work to a jewel that is more valuable than the Kaustubha gem.

The author concludes by emphasizing that the work is meant for wise men and not for ordinary people. He believes that only those who have attained a certain level of understanding will be able to appreciate the true value of the work.

355. Having made an offering of ears and hands, drink this Dharma-rasa, which is conducive to attaining the state of being ageless and immortal. 

36.  Indeed, I have certainly meditated in the middle of the ocean of ancient scriptures. I am certain that I have accumulated the jewels of good sayings.

37.  I have no fear that this ocean of ancient scriptures is vast and deep.  The great teachers who are my predecessors are present everywhere, though they are rare.

38.  The success of this ancient scripture is indicated by its very name. I will speak it, and I am not anxious about whether I will be able to do so or not.

39.  Those who follow the Jina-sena-acharya, having attained the path of the ancient scriptures, surely desire to cross the ocean of existence. What need is there to speak of crossing the ancient scriptures?

40.  The meaning is in the mind, the words are on the tip of the tongue, and the embellishments are well-known. Therefore, there is no delay in the completion of this ancient scripture.

41.  Just as there is no lack of gems in the mines, so too there is no lack of reasoning or substance in the mind.  Then, what is the poverty of a poet who has many kinds of embellishments?

42.  My creation is like a beautiful woman, for just as a beautiful woman walks in many ways, so too this creation has many kinds of words. Just as a beautiful woman is full of rasa, so too this creation is full of many rasas. And just as a beautiful woman is adorned with ornaments, so too this creation is adorned with similes, metaphors, and other embellishments.  Thus, my creation is like a beautiful woman.  For whose fulfillment of desires will it not be?

43.  This auspicious creation will destroy the accumulated sins of the past, control them, and invite good fortune.

This Purana is a delight for the good, and a pleasure for the common people. It is both beneficial and enjoyable, and thus it satisfies everyone completely. ||4|| This Purana has been created and will surely remain in this world until the end of the Yuga. Thus, with this enthusiasm, I begin the narration of the story. ||46||
(Thus ends the introduction.)
Then, King Shrenik, having drunk the nectar of the excellent character of Lord Vrishabhadeva, desired to taste the remaining portion, as if it were something held in his hand. ||47|| He stood up in the middle of the assembly, folded his hands, bowed his head slightly, and then prayed to Gautam Ganadhar, saying, "O Lord, by your grace, I have heard this excellent Purana of Lord Vrishabhadeva. Just as Lord Vrishabhadeva attained Nirvana at the end of this Purana and became happy, so too have I become very happy by hearing it. It is said that in the Tirtha of Lord Vrishabhadeva, there was a king named Jayakumar, the best among all kings, who defeated even Arkakiti, and whose prowess is still famous on earth. During his Digvijaya, he defeated Meghakumar, for which Maharaja Bharat himself took out the Veerapatta and tied it around his neck. Just as Vrishabhadeva was the first among those who performed Tirtha, Emperor Bharat was the first among the Chakravartis, and King Shreyans was the first among those who initiated the practice of Dana Tirtha, so too was he the first to establish the practice of Swayamvara. He made a vow in battle and defeated Arkakiti, the grandson of Lord Vrishabhadeva, single-handedly, as if in a game, and bound him. Then came Vrishabhasena 1, Kumbha 2, Dridharatha 3, Shatadhanu 4, Devasharma 5, Devabhaav 6, Nandan 7, Somadatta 8, Suradatta 9, who was superior in qualities, Vayusharma 10, Yashobahu 11, Devagni 12, Agnidev 13, Agnigupta 14, Mitraagni 15, Halabhrut 16, and others. ||56||

The thirty-fourth Tirthankara is Achala, also known as Meru. Then comes Merudhana, followed by Marubhuti, who is also called Sarvayasha, Sarvayajna, and Sarvabhidhanaka. ||57||  Sarvagupta, Priyaprantaso, Devanta-sarvavak, Sarvadi-vijaya, Gupta, Vijayaditatah para. ||58|| Vijayamitra, Vijayila, Aparajita, Vasumitra, Vishvasena, Sadhusena. ||59|| Devanta-satya, Satyanta-deva, Guptantasatyavak, Satyamitra, the best among the righteous, adorned with pure qualities. ||60|| Vineeta, Samvara, Gupta, Munyad-munidattavak, Muniyajna, Munideva, Yajnantaguptavak. ||61|| Mitrayajna, Swayambhu, Bhagadatta, Bhagad-falgu, Fallavantgupta, Mitradifalka. ||62|| Prajapati, Sarvasandha, Varuna, Dhanapalaka, Maghavan, Rashyanta-tejo, Mahavir, Maharath. ||63|| Vishalaksho, Mahabala, Shuchishala, then Vajra, Vajrasara, Chandrachula. ||64|| Jaya, Maharasa, Kachcha, Maha-kachcha, Atucchhaka, Nami, Vinami, Balatibala. ||65|| Balanta-bhadra, Nandi, Maha-bhagya, then Nandimitra, Kamdeva, Anupam. ||66|| Thus, there are eighty-four Ganadharas of Bhagavan Rishabhadeva, all endowed with seven Riddhis and resembling the omniscient Deva. ||67|| Among these eighty-four Ganadharas, the one who renounced his home, was highly influential, virtuous, and attained the seventy-first number, that is, the seventy-first Ganadhara, was Jayakumar. Please tell me his Purana, as it contains great wonder. You are like a great cloud for the group of Bhavyajiva-like Chataka birds. ||69||  Thereafter, knowing the grace of the Ganadharas, King Shrenik adorned his place, that is, he returned to his place. This is appropriate, as wise men know the signs. ||70|| 'O noble one,' you have asked what we wanted to ask. Therefore, your mind, tongue, and we are all one. Thus, the assembly addressed him. ||71||

## Chapter 358: The Adi Purana

**72.** The Ganadhara was asked by the king, and he was inclined to grant him grace. The virtuous do not turn away from those who seek their help; that is their nature.

**73.** Listen, Shrenik, to the question you have asked at this opportune moment. The wise, who know the right time, do not fail to subdue anyone.

**74.** In the Jambudvipa, in the southern Bharata Kshetra, there is a vast country called Kurujangala, filled with various varnas and ashramas.

**75.** This country is a treasure trove of Dharma, Artha, Kama, and Moksha in the world. It shines like heaven, or like the celestial chariot of the king of the gods.

**76.** In that country, there is a city called Hastinapur, which is adorned with all kinds of wealth. It seems to be like the ancestral home of Lakshmi, proving the birth of Lakshmi in the ocean to be false.

**77.** The king of that city was Soma Prabha, who resembled the moon. Just as the moon, with its excellent rays, delights and blooms the kumuda flowers, and is dependent on the planet Mercury, so too, this king, with his excellent taxes, delighted the earth and was dependent on the wise.

**78.** His wife was Lakshmiwati, a very beautiful and devoted wife, who seemed like another Lakshmi, who, without rejecting the first Lakshmi, resided in his chest.

**79.** Just as victory is born from intelligence and valor, so too, a son named Jayakumar was born to Lakshmiwati and Soma Prabha. From birth, he was expanding his wealth and fame, like Lakshmi acquired through virtues.

**80.** Besides Vijay, fourteen other sons were born to Soma Prabha, who, though equal in number, surpassed the Manus in virtues.

**81.** With these fifteen sons, who were extremely devoted and skilled in various arts, the king ruled as the king of kings, like the moon adorned with beautiful, special arts.

The thirty-fourth chapter: King Soma Prabha, the lord of kings, was adorned with fifteen sons, who were all excellent, exceedingly beautiful, and possessed of special skills. ||81||
The kingdom ruled by King Soma Prabha, with Queen Lakshmi Mati, his beloved younger brother Shreyans, and his eldest son Jay Kumar, was revered by all. ||82||
King Soma Prabha, like a Kalpavriksha, with branches of sons, was a source of enjoyment for himself and for those who had accumulated merit. This was truly remarkable. ||83||
Later, King Soma Prabha, who understood the true nature of things, renounced the world, the body, pleasures, and his brothers, considering them impermanent, impure, sources of suffering, and different from his true self. He became eager to attain the eternal kingdom of liberation, which is characterized by infinite strength and other virtues. He entrusted the kingdom to his valiant and capable son Jay Kumar and went to the presence of Lord Rishabhadeva. There, he received initiation along with his younger brother Shreyans and experienced the bliss of liberation. Just as they had enjoyed the pleasures of the kingdom together in the past, they now enjoyed the bliss of liberation together. ||84-86||
Meanwhile, the noble Jay Kumar, assuming his father's position, ruled the earth. He shared his vast wealth and enjoyed it with his younger brothers. ||87||
One day, Jay Kumar went to a garden outside the city for recreation. There, he saw the great sage Shilagupta and circumambulated him three times. With great devotion, he bowed, praised him, listened to the Dharma with joy, and then returned to the city after taking leave. ||88-89||
In the same forest, a pair of snakes lived. They also heard the Dharma from the king, considered it nectar, and drank the sweet nectar of compassion with great love. ||90||
Once, at the beginning of the rainy season, a powerful thunderbolt struck the pair of snakes. One of them died peacefully and became a Nagakumar, a celestial being. ||91||
1 Soma Prabha. 2 Abundance of branches. 3 Soma Prabha. 4 One who sees the true nature of things. 5 Capable. 6 Imperishable. 7 Importance. 8 Meaning: Eager for the best kingdom. 9 Near. 10 With his own younger brother. 11 Kingship. 12 As during the time of the kingdom. 13 Relying on. 14 He ruled. 15 With L., M. 16 -Guptmaha-L., M.

The wise should ponder even the words of the noble, what to speak of the words of women? For the lustful, what is there to ponder? (11) This noble being will be the destroyer of the world in this very birth, therefore he has no fear from others, but those who wish to frighten him are themselves afraid. (115) Where am I? And where is this Dharma? This Dharma too I have obtained from association with him, therefore in this world, until I attain liberation, there is nothing else for me but the company of the noble. (116) Thinking thus, the Nagakumar became free from anger, knowing the favor, he himself worshipped Jayakumar with precious jewels, and told him of his thoughts of killing him, etc., and said, "Remember me in your work," and then he returned to his own place. It is well, for he who has the brilliance of merit, even his killer becomes a benefactor. (117-118) That Jayakumar, who possessed manifest prowess, along with the Chakravarti Bharat Maharaj, attacked all directions, and then, stopping his movement hither and thither, took refuge in the peace of a sage. (119) He, though gentle, was the bearer of blazing glory, though without qualities, he was a mine of qualities, though with all limbs, he was like the bodiless, and he dwelt happily in his own city. (120)
Now, there is a vast country called Kashi, which is famous, and it seems as if the land of enjoyment has come together in one place, out of fear of the robber, Time. (121) Even then, there were many kinds of trees, like Kalpa trees, surrounded by Kalpa creepers, here and there. (122) Since the desired objects are obtained and enjoyed in that very country, I think that Kashi country...

Chapter Thirty-Six

363. In the city of Varanasi, which was like Amarpuri with its countless palaces, the people were happy and prosperous. 124. A being who had accumulated evil karma in a previous life was not worthy of being born in Varanasi. Even if such a being was born there, could they ever become sinful, even by mistake? No. 125. Thus, this city, which indicated the welfare of the past, present, and future, guided even those who lived elsewhere to the path of Dharma, just as the teachings of the Jinas do. 126. Just as a humble person is the master of knowledge, so too was the king Akampan, whose very name terrified his enemies, the master of this city. Just as knowledge grants one's desired objects, so too did this city grant its inhabitants their desires. 127. The king's policy, earned through good deeds in past lives, was not only for the increase and protection of Lakshmi, but also for the benefit of Dharma and Kama. 128. He was not only a collector of taxes from his people, but also a giver to them. He did not only punish them, but also protected them. Thus, the king, victorious through Dharma, nurtured all his subjects. 129. Just as Bharata honored Vrishabhadeva in the state of Paramatma, so too did he honor Akampan in the household. 130. Akampan had a queen named Suprabha, who was like the radiance of the moon. Just as the moon, the abode of many arts, shines brightly and brings joy to the lotus flowers, so too did Akampan, the abode of many arts and knowledge, shine brightly and bring joy to all beings on earth through his queen Suprabha. 131. Just as Suprabha, the virtuous queen who gave birth to excellent children, brought joy to the king, so too did Lakshmi not bring him joy. This is because, just as excellent vines bear good fruit, so too are virtuous wives, who bear children, dear to their husbands. 132.

Just as the rays of the sun, emanating from the east, illuminate all directions with their brilliance, so too did the king, Akampan, the foremost of the Nath dynasty, beget a thousand sons, who, like the sun, subdued the directions with their radiance. || 133 || Surrounded by these sons, named Hemaangad, Suketu, Shrikant, and others, the king shone brightly, like Indra surrounded by his celestial attendants. || 134 || Just as the rivers Ganga and Sindhu flow from the Himalayas and the lotus respectively, so too were born two daughters, Sulochana and Lakshmimati, from the king Akampan and queen Suprabha, both possessing auspicious qualities. || 135 || Sulochana, like Lakshmi herself, was a delight to behold, her beauty enhanced by her artistic skills, like the moon in its full glory. || 136 || Just as the full moon night enhances the beauty of the moon's rays, so too did the nurse, Sumitra, nurture the exquisite beauty of Sulochana. || 137 || The color red, or 'raga', found its abode in Sulochana's lotus feet, making it 'ragi', or imbued with the color red. Indeed, who would not be attracted to their rightful place? || 138 || It is a wonder that the moon-like radiance of her nails, constantly dwelling on her lotus feet, continued to delight all the 'kuvalaya', or white lotuses, or the entire earth. || 139 || Her toes, adorned with the brilliance of her nails, seemed to have been placed by Kamadeva himself, as if to signify the ten 'vegas' (impulses) of love. || 140 || Jayakumar, who was revered by all, was also born to them. What is the lotus that is not adorned by the beauty of her lotus feet? || 141 ||
Just as women who give birth to excellent sons are also beloved, so too are they. || 132 ||

The Thirty-Fourth Chapter

Neither thick nor thin, neither straight nor crooked, neither close nor far apart, nor were her thighs in any way awkward. Her thighs had a unique beauty. || 142 ||
Looking at her hips, one could imagine them to be thick, joined together, and shaped like the pillars of the door of the inner sanctum of Kamadeva. || 143 ||
Her hips were beautiful, like the altar of Kamadeva, or the head of an elephant in the form of Kamadeva, or the peak of a mountain in the form of Kamadeva. || 144 ||
Her waist was so beautifully adorned, as if the Creator had first made it very thin and then, fearing it might break, had bound it tightly with three ropes in the form of three lines. || 145 ||
The hair on her body, emerging from the well of her navel, was as beautiful as a row of green grass emerging from a water channel. || 146 ||
Her breasts were different yet joined together (due to their thickness), soft yet firm (due to their elevation), and warm yet soothing (due to their pleasantness). Thus, her breasts, possessing contradictory qualities, upheld the doctrine of Syadvada. || 147 ||
How can one describe her arms, which, embracing Lakshmi, who resides in the chest, have accepted Jayakumaara? || 148 ||
Her neck, embraced by the right and left arms of Jayakumaara, adorned with the beautiful Lakshmi, is beyond comparison. What can be said about it? || 149 ||
Her cheeks, free from wrinkles, soft, and smooth, were as beautiful as mirrors reflecting the lotus-like face of Jayakumaara, with their brilliance and the luster of the teeth of an elephant calf. || 150 ||
Her lips, compared to the bud of a banyan tree, the bimbi fruit, and coral, are far superior in color, shape, and taste. || 151 ||
17
How can the beauty of her lotus-like feet, which will be worshipped with great affection, be compared to lotuses? It cannot be. || 141 ||

Adipurana
"Her teeth were flawless, white, even, smooth, beautiful, and radiant. How else could her mouth contain them?  ||152|| Why was her nose made so high, with its sweet fragrance? How could her mouth be centered if she didn't have a nose? ||153|| Her eyes, like Arjuna's arrows, reached the edge of her ears. They had conquered both the red lotus and the blue lotus. What reproach could the Soma dynasty, or Jayakumar, have against them? ||154|| Her ears were the most virtuous of all ears, for they were already destined to be the recipients of her beloved Jayakumar's loving words and songs. ||155|| I believe that Kamadeva, seeing Jayakumar as invincible in his own form, conquered him with the bow of her eyebrows and the arrows of her glances. ||156|| Not only was Kamadeva her servant, but the valiant Jayakumar himself was her servant. Why then should her forehead, which held beauty, not be elevated and excellent? ||157|| Her hair was soft, fine, smooth, black, and slightly curly. To lovers, they seemed like the young of black snakes. ||158|| The front of her face was adorned with her eyes and other features, and the back of her face was beautiful in itself, like a beautiful object. ||159|| The atoms that the Creator used to create her body were, in truth, just like the atoms of dust and grass. ||160||

Her lips could not be compared to anything because they had no color, shape, or taste. ||151||

Thirty-fourth Chapter
367
The moon is not a suitable comparison for her face, because if we compare it to a full moon, it is very old, its decay is near, its blemishes are clearly visible, and Rahu eclipses it. If we compare it to an incomplete moon, it is itself incomplete - unfinished. Meaning - Her face was youthful, imperishable, spotless, and complete, so neither a full nor an incomplete moon was a suitable comparison for her face. 161. Even if we compare it to a lotus, it is not right, because there was no Lakshmi in the lotus before it bloomed, and it does not remain behind, it keeps blooming moment by moment, but the Lakshmi on her face was a unique beauty, taking on the form of Syadvada. Meaning - The beauty of her face remained the same, yet it took on a unique beauty moment by moment, so it was far better than the beauty of the lotus, and thus it manifested the form of Syadvada, because just as Syadvada remains the same in the Dravyarthic Nay, yet manifests new forms in the Paryayarthic Nay, in the same way, the Lakshmi on her face remained the same in general, yet manifested many forms by taking on a unique beauty every moment. 162. The moon's beauty is destroyed by the sun, and the lotus's beauty is destroyed by the moon, but the beauty of her face was becoming unique by the hand of Jayakumar's Lakshmi. 163. The moon shines brightly at night, and the lotus blooms during the day, the moon decays, and the lotus withers, but her face was full, blooming, and shining brightly day and night. 164. The beauty of whoever looked at Sulochana's face increased, and the beauty of whoever Sulochana's face looked at also increased for sure. What quality is there in the lotus that it can be compared to Sulochana's face? 165. She had conquered the god of love, who conquers the three worlds, in her maidenhood, then who else in the world was a warrior who would not be conquered by her in her youth? 166. She had conquered the god of love in her maidenhood, and she had conquered Jayakumar in her youth, then what is the limit of her victory with her glory? 167. 
12
The excellent particles were there, and the rest of the remaining particles were as insignificant as grass. 160.

## The Adipurana, Chapter 10, Verses 12-17

**168.** I believe this blemish on the moon is due to this maiden. The king of diseases, consumption, has overcome him due to her brilliance.

**169.** The moon, along with the Kuvalaya (a type of white lotus), and Lakshmi, along with the lotus, have been conquered by her face. What else remains in this world that cannot be conquered by her face?

**170.** I believe that the water lily, dwelling in water, and the land lily, nourished by the sun's rays, are still performing austerities to attain the beauty of her face.

**171.** Like the lines of the second moon, she grew gradually through her arts. As she grew, her qualities, rivaling the moon's brilliance, also flourished.

**172.** Thus, the god of love, fearing victory and defeat, did not even touch her with his hand, even in her youth, she who was adorned with all limbs and born of a pure lineage.

**173.** This maiden had many images of the Jina made of jewels, and all their accessories were made of gold.

**174.** At the end of their installation and consecration, she performed great pujas for them. She praised the Arhats with devotional hymns, full of meaning.

**175.** She gave gifts of vessels, honored the great monks, listened to the Dharma, and contemplated the meaning of the scriptures and the path to liberation, repeatedly attaining the purity of right faith.

**176.** Then, in the month of Phalguna, she performed an eight-day puja for the Jina with devotion, worshiped the images according to the rules, observed a fast, and, with a slender body, came to give the remaining offerings.

**177.** The king, seated on his throne, rose and folded his hands in reverence.

**178.** She took the remaining offerings and placed them on her own head.

The thirty-fourth chapter: The daughter, exhausted from the fast, said, "Go home, daughter, it is time for your parana." He dismissed her. Seeing her, the king, full of youth, without any blemish, thought about her marriage ceremony. On an auspicious day, he called his ministers, Shrutaartha, Siddhartha, Sarvartha, and Sumati, who were like the four types of wisdom: Kosthabuddhi, Beejabuddhi, Padanusari, and Sambhinna Shrotri. He asked them, "All the kings desire this daughter, who is the life of our lineage. After considering, tell me, to whom should we give this beautiful daughter?" 

Then Shrutaartha, the ocean of scriptures, said, "In this marriage, there should be a gathering of good relatives, the son-in-law should be from a great lineage. There will be a lot of expenditure in this marriage, and we will get the fruits of our birth and kingdom. Therefore, wise men should consider this matter carefully. If this relationship is made with the Chakravarti, then all the kings can become our relatives, and your lineage will also become revered like the Ikshvaku lineage. All the qualities that should be sought in a groom, like lineage, beauty, age, knowledge, character, splendor, and valor, are present in him. Therefore, there is no need for any discussion. This daughter should be given to the son of the Chakravarti, whose fame has spread throughout all directions, and who has conquered even the reflection of the sun with his brilliance."

At that time, Siddhartha said, "All that you have said is true, but those who know the past customs do not consider it good for a younger person to have a relationship with an elder. Therefore, there are many famous princes, like Prabhanjana, Rathvara, Bali, Vajrayudha, Megheshvara (Jayakumar), and Bhimabhuja, who are full of wealth and clever, and are worthy of being grooms."

Many poets like Meghaśvara, Bhimabhuja and others have arisen. There are many poets, where there is a festival of poetry. ||19|| Having consulted the learned and the astrologers and observed the omens, one should give the daughter to him who is suitable and has a good relationship with us. ||19|| Having heard everything, Sarvartha, the knower of all things, replied, "We already have a relationship with the Bhūmigocaras. However, a relationship with the Vidyadharas is an unprecedented gain and praiseworthy. Therefore, after considering, it is decided that the daughter should be given to one of the Vidyadharas." ||192-193|| Having heard this, Sumati, the knower of the right, said to the assembled people, "It is not right to say this, as it will lead to enmity." ||194|| "If the Cakrin hears that the daughter has been given to a Vidyadhara, he will think, 'Is there no suitable groom among the Bhūmigocaras?' and this will cause some resentment." ||195|| "I have thought of a good solution that will not cause any conflict. It is the method of Swayamvara, which is mentioned in the ancient Puranas. If Akompana starts this method now, his fame will spread throughout the world, like that of Vṛṣabhadev and his son, Emperor Bharata, until the end of the age." ||196-197|| "Therefore, the daughter should be given in Swayamvara to a virtuous prince who accepts her. By doing this, we will not have any conflict with Adibrahmā, Lord Vṛṣabhadev, or with Emperor Bharata, the establisher of the age, nor will there be any enmity between the kings." ||198|| All the people, including the king, agreed with what Sumati, the minister, said. This is right, because those who follow the path of righteousness do not have envy. ||199|| After honoring the ministers, the king went to his palace and took care of all the arrangements. ||200||

Having informed Suprabhadevi and his eldest son Hemaangad of the news, and having consulted with the elders of the family and the members of his clan, the king sent out messengers to various kings. Some were sent with *nisrishtaarth* (self-determined) messages, some with *mitaartha* (limited) messages, and some with letters enclosed in gifts. He honored them with gifts and respect, and informed them of the purpose of the *svayamvara*.  ||200-203||
Upon hearing this news, the god *Vichitraangad*, who had been the brother of king Akampan in a previous life, arrived from the *Soudharma* heaven. He saw king Akampan and said, "I have come to witness the *svayamvara* of the virtuous Sulochana." ||204-205||
Following the king's orders, he built a palace called *Sarvatobhadra* in a peaceful, excellent, suitable, and beautiful place north of the *Brahmasthan* near the city. The palace faced east, was filled with auspicious materials, had a wedding pavilion, and was multi-storied. ||206-207||
The palace was surrounded by various alleys, forts, and beautification houses. It was radiant and made of jewels and gold. The wise god, following the proper procedures, built the palace and then built a grand *svayamvara* hall around it. The hall was pure, large, with a divided floor, square, with four doors, adorned with forts and gateways, decorated with rows of flags adorned with jeweled arches, and adorned with golden pots shining on the tops of the radiant peaks. ||208-211||

King Akampan, who was eager to celebrate, personally welcomed the kings and, pleased with them, led them into the city of Varanasi, which was as beautiful as Sulochana's heart.  || 230 ||

Akampan, who had adorned his home and other places with festive flags, and whose sons, like Hemaangad, were by his side, welcomed Arkakirti, who was like the rising sun with its rays, and led him into the city, just as Bharat had done. || 231-232 ||

Akampan, the leader of the Nath dynasty, went to meet Jayakumar, as if to indicate his future success with his own affection. || 233 ||

Then, all the kings, who resided between the three oceans, arrived in Varanasi, their joy increasing, like the ocean flowing towards the full moon. || 234 ||

Akampan himself went halfway to meet some of the kings with all his wealth, and sent others, like the honorable Hemaangad, to meet the rest. || 235 ||

As each king arrived, Akampan welcomed them into the city, which was adorned with fluttering flags, as if beckoning them. || 236 ||

At that time, Sulochana, who was seated in the royal palace, surrounded by the kings of the earth and the celestial beings, made her father, the conqueror of the world, a Chakravarti. || 237 ||

Varanasi, which had conquered Ayodhya, rejected it by its very name.  From that time onwards, it has been said that there is no gem more precious than a daughter. || 238 ||

The thirty-fourth chapter, all this is from the previously earned righteous conduct. Dharma is the only thing worthy of worship, thinking this, the best among the learned, King Akampan, performed the worship of the Jineshvari, made the poor, the orphans and the beggars free from begging, and got ready for the festival of renunciation for everyone. Considering the Lakshmi spent on good deeds as imperishable and fruitful, he became eligible to enjoy the whole earth, just as the earth was for his enjoyment. Meaning - All the people of the earth started enjoying his kingdom.  Thus, he started his work after worshipping the Jineshvari, it is right because the work done after worshipping the worthy people is sure to be successful. At that time, the conch shell announcing the wedding festival was blown, which filled everyone's mind with joy and then the sound of the conch shell filled the ears. At that time, there were flower offerings everywhere on the earth, flags were dancing in the sky, the directions were resounding with the sound of big drums that defeated the roar of the ocean, the big streets were purified, torans were tied in them and the big palaces were again whitened with fresh lime. The beautiful eyes of the women there were painted with kajal, their hair was adorned with garlands, the creeper-like eyebrows were well-shaped, they had beautiful tilak on their foreheads, their bright ears were slightly bent down due to the weight of the earrings made of gems, their cheeks were adorned with various designs like pictures of leaves, etc. made by hand, their necks were beautiful, their chests were adorned with sandalwood paste, big garlands and breasts, their arms were shining with the rays of big gems, their large buttocks

It is indeed fitting that she, by virtue of her good fortune, should be pleased to see all the kings, for just as the valor of men who have conquered their enemies is praiseworthy, so too is the good fortune of women. || 283 ||
Then, at the behest of the Kunchuki, she descended from the palace, having captivated the hearts of those kings with her playful glances. || 285 ||
Wherever her gaze fell, it was as if it were nailed there, and those kings, unable to look at her as she descended, were filled with sorrow. || 286 ||
Then, she mounted a chariot adorned with golden tassels and driven by horses, its sound a symphony of tinkling bells, a chariot that seemed to be constantly engaged in the annihilation of the ugly and the summoning of the beautiful, with its banners fluttering up and down like arms. || 287-288 ||
Once again, she embraced the knowledge of Kamadeva, dear to the heart, like a creeper of lightning in the midst of the brilliance of pearl ornaments, fanned by the pure chamaras that rivaled the moon and constantly dispelled the flaws in the eyes of the people. || 289-290 ||
The one who was once rejected, Kamadeva, is now accepted by her. It is fitting, for wise men, even when they have rejected something, accept it again when it serves their purpose. || 291 ||
Like a demon, he immediately entered all her limbs, and at will, he manifested the distortions that arose in her eyebrows, eyes, and mouth. || 292 ||
"If I had a body, could I achieve unity with this Sulochana? Could I enter her body?" Thus, Kamadeva, as if he were pleased with his bodiless state, thought to himself. || 293 ||
She, the embodiment of all pleasures, was enjoyed by Kamadeva in a distorted form. Having rejected the bodies of those who had been conquered, he would achieve victory. || 294 ||

A man may or may not become wealthy by collecting taxes from the earth to the sea, but the one who receives the hand of this Sulochana will have Lakshmi in his hands. ||295||
The essence of saltiness is in the ocean for men, and the essence of beauty is in this Sulochana for women. This is why all the rivers have reached the ocean, and all the kings have come to her. ||296||
Her beauty increases even when it is consumed by the eyes of all, but how can the ocean possess it, since Lakshmi has abandoned it? ||297||
The ocean boasts of its wealth in vain, for it is only adorned by the kings Akampan and Rani Suprabha, who possess this jewel-like daughter. ||298||

381. Thus praised for her beauty, fortune, and auspiciousness, she, like Lakshmi, arrived at the Swayamvara hall. ||299||

300.  What kind of victory or defeat awaited her?  The kings, caught between joy and sorrow, experienced an indescribable emotion. ||300||

301.  Mahendradatta, adorned with a garland of jewels, sat on the chariot and urged it forward, facing the lords of the Vidyadharas. ||301||

302.  He said, "These are the sons of Nimi and Vinami, the leaders of the southern and northern ranks.  This is Sunami, the lord of Lakshmi, and this is Suvinami, over there." ||302||

303.  "There are many other lords of the Vidyadharas, adorned with knowledge and valor.  Choose one of them as your husband and fulfill your desire." ||303||

304.  The Kankuci, having announced their names individually, whispered them into her ear.  She ignored them all, for the desires of beings are diverse. ||304||

305.  She looked at everyone and then decided to choose someone.  The Vidyadharas remained seated, for hope does not abandon anyone. ||305||

306.  Just as lotus blossoms open at sunrise and wilt at sunset, so too did the faces of the kings, like lotus flowers, bloom at the sight of her chariot, but wilted after it passed.  Such is the nature of the world. ||306||

307.  The chariot, having descended from the high ground of the Vidyadharas, moved towards the earth-dwellers.  The Kankuci, as he drove, announced the names of the kings. ||307||

308.  Just as the cuckoo, in spring, abandons all trees and goes to the mango tree, so too did the invincible Sulochana, abandoning the kings like Arka Kirti, go to Jayakumar. ||308||

309.  At that moment, the Kankuci, with her heart filled with joy, spoke words of victory. ||309||

This lord, the son of Soma Prabha, is the lamp of his own lineage. This glorious one, surrounded by his younger brothers, is known as Jayakumar. ||310|| His form is not worthy of description, for what need is there for a mirror to see a bracelet on the hand? ||311|| Having conquered the gods known as Megha Kumaras in the northern Bharat Kshetra, he made a lion's roar, conquering the sound of their artificial clouds. ||312|| The lord of treasures, Bharat, with joy, tied the warrior's belt on him, raised by his own arms, and named him Megha Swar. ||313|| Endowed with qualities befitting the soul, and always in the company of respectable, noble men, he is praised for his intelligence and special enthusiasm, making him the best among the best. ||314|| It is also a wonder that his qualities, having pleased the beings of the three worlds, have now returned in full to captivate your heart. Meaning: He has pleased the beings of the three worlds with his qualities, and now desires to please you as well. ||315|| If there is a fault in him, it is only this: he has four wives: Shri, Kirti, Veer Lakshmi, and Saraswati. All four are very dear to him. ||316|| This Jayakumar, who had previously conquered Megha Kumar alone, now seems to be without courage in conquering you. It seems as if his courage has deserted him, which is why he has now taken Kamadeva as his helper. ||317|| Caught between you two powerful ones, each desiring to conquer the other, Kamadeva, skilled in the six categories of diplomacy, is experiencing a dual nature, sometimes taking your side and sometimes his. ||318|| His fame delights the Kuvalaya, the lotus that blooms at night (the moon), and his brilliance makes the Padma, the lotus that blooms during the day (Lakshmi), flourish.

Fame is always outside, Lakshmi is very old, Saraswati is aged, and even the valiant Lakshmi appears calm. Therefore, your creeper of affection, adorned with flowers of sight and well-grown, will bear fruit in you, who are endowed with the qualities of age, form, character, etc. 
Meaning - In the 316th verse, it was stated that he has four beloved wives: Fame, Lakshmi, Saraswati, and Valiant Lakshmi, but you will not have to experience the pain of co-wives from them. Because the woman named Fame always roams outside, she cannot enter the inner palace (in the context, her fame is spread throughout the world), Lakshmi is very old (in the context, she is advanced in age), Saraswati is also aged, i.e., her body is becoming weak due to old age (in the context, she is mature), therefore, he does not have much love for these three. Now, Valiant Lakshmi remains, although she is young and always stays with him, but she is very calm, she is not attracted to romance, etc. (in the context, she is forgiving and valiant), therefore, the king's affection will be diverted from these four and will be fixed on you because you are endowed with the qualities of age, form, character, etc. || 320 - 321 ||
You both have defeated and driven away the god of love, but now you have seated him in your hearts, or made him a special confidant, but now the same god of love is preparing to defeat you both, which is right because no matter how much trust is placed in an enemy, he remains an enemy in the end. || 322 ||
Although this god of love is your enemy, he is still increasing his influence on you, considering you to be a woman, which is right because warriors are jealous of warriors. 
Meaning - He does not cause much pain to you, considering you to be a woman and a coward, but Jayakumar is exerting his full influence. || 323 ||
You have conquered the glorious Jayakumar, whose victory is famous everywhere, by mere arrival (in the context, departure for war), therefore, your victory in this place is just. || 324 ||
Bind this Jayakumar, whom you have conquered with your arrows of sight, with a garland of jewels around his neck and take him in your hand, victory-Lakshmi will be yours. || 325 ||
Hearing these words of the god of love, who knows the six qualities of peace, war, etc., the one whose shyness is gradually fading, whose playful gaze is very fickle, and at that time, the love of past lives, seen through the eyes, 
383
1 Valiant Lakshmi. Of Jayakumar. 3 You both are defeated by the god of love - Lo. 4 Trusted. 5 Victory. 6 By mere arrival. 7 Having made it conducive to binding, meaning bound. 8 For that reason. 9 Shyness. 10 Being drawn by the eyes. 11 Shining like jasmine. 12 Subjects of hearing knowledge.

Thus, this has been briefly narrated and explained. Taking the garland of jewels, the maiden, Sulochana, placed it in the hand of Jayakumar. ||328|| Filled with immense love, she placed the garland around his neck, which was like a bond of kinship. The garland, like another Lakshmi, adorned his chest. ||329|| Suddenly, a great sound arose from all the musical instruments, as if announcing a grand festival for the daughters of the directions, for Sulochana. ||330|| The lotus-faced Jayakumar, the lord of the human and celestial beings, was resplendent, as if Lakshmi had taken refuge in his lotus-like face. ||331|| The celestial kings, whose hope-filled waters had dried up, and whose lotus-like faces and lily-like eyes had lost their luster, were like dry lakes, filled with sorrow. ||332|| 

Malini Chanda
The lord of the noble lineage, whose joy is increasing due to the fulfillment of his desired fruit, with his beloved daughter, like a Kalpavriksha with a Kalpalata, and with his son, like a victorious immortal tree, entered his magnificent city, leading the revered Jayakumar. ||333||

Shadulla Vikridita
This Jayakumar, the first in the honorable ceremony of the Swayamvara, surrounded by the beautiful women, the radiance of whose faces was like the radiance of the king of serpents, and whose garland of virtues had sought refuge in him, like a garland of Mandara flowers, his fame, pure and vast, will spread throughout the universe until the end of the Kalpa. ||334||

Vasantatilaka
The one whose radiant light caused the lotuses to bloom, whose rise was marked by the rejection of the influence of others, and whose victory was like the sun and moon, shining brightly over his kin and subjects, like a cluster of moonflowers. ||335||

## The Thirty-Fourth Parva

**385** The auspicious Lakshmi, whose good fortune is clearly evident, was marrying off her son Jayakumar, who was adorned with the radiance of the moon, to the beloved daughter of the king, who was like the sun in the sky of the Nath dynasty. This is the highest knowledge of the wise, for it is said that only those who possess a blazing brilliance are worthy of extraordinary Lakshmi and fame. **336**

**337**  This is the auspiciousness, the beauty, the glory, the Lakshmi of good fortune, the father who gave birth to him, the mother who gave birth to him, the one who is blessed with good children. He is the jewel of the world, the crown jewel, the one who is worthy of worship, the one who brings victory. This is the joyous proclamation of the people, celebrating his birth.

**338**  Jayakumar, adorned with the brilliance of the Kuvalaya (lotus), was radiant, his glory spreading everywhere, his reputation firmly established, and he was always happy. May his victory continue to grow, his fame spreading far and wide, as he conquers the sun with his mature prowess. **338**

**339**  Thus, Jayakumar, who had attained Lakshmi by worshipping the Jina, the Lord of the universe, and who had earned great merit, was blessed with all kinds of good fortune. Therefore, O wise ones, with unwavering faith, worship the lotus feet of the supreme Jina, the one who is free from all duality. **339**

Thus ends the Thirty-Fourth Parva, titled "The Kalyanak of the Garland of the Swayamvara," from the *Trishattilakshana Mahapurana Sangraha*, composed by the venerable Acharya Gunabhadra. **43**

## Forty-fourth Chapter

Then there was a wicked man named Durmarshan, who was intolerant of the virtuous. He incited all the kings, being a servant of Arkakirti, a sinner.  He was a steadfast villain, a petty man, intoxicated by false wealth. He falsely called you all together, boasting of his own wealth.  He had planned beforehand, and had a garland placed around Jayakumar's neck, intending to bring about his permanent defeat for all time.  

Speaking thus, he approached the son of the Chakravarti, Arkakirti, who was ashamed. He said, "There are only two masters of these six continents, you and your father."  The jewels are the daughters, and among the daughters, Sulochana is the best jewel.  That is why Akampan brought you to his house and showed you his wickedness.  

Who is Jayakumar, for whom Akampan, driven by death, gave his daughter? I am unable to bear this wickedness, and that is why I have come to you.  Even ordinary people cannot tolerate small insults, how then can you, a man of great intellect, tolerate an insult born of a woman?  

Therefore, give me your command, and I will, by your command alone, give Akampan the place of Yama, and give you the garland and the girl.  

Thus, the wicked man, by his own words, aroused the wicked anger of his master.  It is right, for both the virtuous and the wicked have the same power to perform good and bad deeds.  The wind of his words, like a blazing fire, with a flag of smoke, and eyes like burning coals, was like a blazing fire god.

"The wicked one who insulted me and gave me this girl, has already poured water on his own head, like a fool." || 12 ||
"When the chariot carrying the girl passed by, my anger, like fire, flared up. But I stood there, not knowing who to burn." || 13 ||
"The fool, deceived by his name, thinks he is unshakeable. He doesn't know that the earth, along with the mountains, trembles when I am angry." || 14 ||
"My sword-like stream of water is beyond reach. My army-like waves easily destroy all enemies with ease." || 15 ||
"The vast forest of withered, wicked Nath and Soma dynasties, will be consumed by my blazing anger, and will never sprout again in this world." || 16 ||
"I endured the coronation of Jayakumar, the king of the earth, out of fear of him. But how can I endure this garland, which destroys all my good fortune?" || 17 ||
"My garland of fame, made of fragrant flowers, will remain until the end of this age. I will take this garland from Jayakumar's chest, along with Jayalakshmi, today." || 18 ||
"Having conquered the soft clouds, which dissolve with just a touch of wind, and gained arrogance, I will see the victory of Jayakumar in battle today." || 19 ||
"Thus, Arkkirti, who has broken the rules, whose mind is confused about what is right and wrong, and who cannot be stopped, conquered the roar of the ocean of the end of time with his words. Just as wind helps to fan a fire, so too, many people helped to fuel his anger." || 20 ||

Then, the minister, Anvadyamati, who was pure from all impurities and possessed the qualities of a minister, was recognized by the people of the kingdom and others. ||22||

He spoke words that were full of the essence of glory, well-formed, not cruel, well-considered, just, and beneficial. ||23||

He said, "The earth, the sky, the moon, the sun, the ocean, the wind, the fire, you, your father, the clouds, and time, all these are the benefactors of the world." ||24||

"Because of the reversal in you, this creation is reversed, and because of your adherence, it exists well. It is clear that this creation depends on you." ||25||

"The qualities like forgiveness, etc., are present individually in the earth, etc., but they are all together in the Chakravarti and in you for the benefit of the world." ||26||

"The earth, etc., sometimes deviate from their proper place, but there is no time that can make you two deviate from your proper place." ||27||

"This creation, which is the earth, was created by your grandfather, the Lord Vrishabhadeva, and was entrusted to him. Your father, King Bharat, is protecting it now, and after him, you are the one who will protect it." ||28||

"If there is any harm to anyone in this world due to divine or human-made troubles, then you should consider it as 'mine' and resolve it." ||29||

"The one who protects from injury is called Kshatriya. You are the eldest son of the King of the Bharatas, and therefore you are the first Kshatriya in this world." ||30||

"New laws originate from you, and the old ones are also protected by you. Therefore, the old ones are also yours." ||31||

## Forty-fourth Chapter

389. This path, spoken of in the scriptures and Smritis, is eternal. Among the various forms of marriage, Swayamvara is the most excellent. ||32||

If a maiden, worthy of merit, is desired by all, then to avoid conflict, the wise have ordained this Swayamvara, which is governed by fate. ||33||

Among the noble families, she chooses one, according to her destiny, whether he is wealthy or poor, virtuous or lacking virtue, handsome or ugly. Others should not be envious, for this is the way of justice. ||34-35||

If anyone violates this justice, you must protect it. This is not fitting for you. Can a protector ever be a thief or an enemy? ||36||

Just as the peaks of Nishadha and Nila are the best parts of Mount Meru, so too, Lord Adinath made the Nath and Chandra lineages the best parts, the supporters, of your lineage, which is like a mountain. ||37||

Just as the moon is worshipped by all the celestial beings, so too, the great king Akampan, among all the Kshatriyas, is worshipped by all, like a Chakravarti. ||38||

King Bharat considers Akampan equal to Lord Rishabhadeva. Therefore, you should also be humble towards him, for it is said that disrespecting the worthy brings misfortune in both worlds. ||39||

And see, this Chandra lineage is also said to be like the Nath lineage. Just as your lineage gave rise to the Dharma Tirtha, so too, the Chandra lineage gave rise to the Dana Tirtha. ||40||

The wheel of a Chakravarti is praiseworthy simply by moving forward, but in tasks that are difficult to achieve, they usually praise only the victor. ||41||

Everyone in the world saw his valor during his conquest of the directions. You should remember the prowess he displayed at that time. ||42||

Knowing that this warrior has the potential for heroism, he should be respected by the warriors. What is there to say about one who has achieved his goal, having seen the essence of his own ability? ||43||

## Translation:

**44.**  Even without the Chakra and the Jewels, Lakshmi will be yours to enjoy. Your divine Siddhi will arise from your virtuous deeds, just as your human Siddhi will arise from Jayakumar.

**45.**  If even a man as insignificant as a blade of grass deserves protection, how can you consider destroying the lineage of the Nathas and the Somvanshas, who are like the very arms of Lakshmi?

**46.**  By destroying your brothers and servants, you will incur the wrath of the Chakravarti, and this injustice, which will last until the end of the age, will be attributed to you.

**47.**  Do not indulge in the desire for another man's wife. Even if you forcibly take her, she will never be yours.

**48.**  Jayakumar's glory, accompanied by his prowess, will endure like the day, while your tarnished reputation will remain like the night.

**49.**  Do not think that all these kings will help you in battle. Many of them are actually on their side.

**50.**  You have attained the three Purusharthas (Dharma, Artha, and Kama), which are very difficult for men to achieve. Why are you destroying them by violating the path of righteousness?

**51.**  Jayakumar, who was once the commander of the Chakravarti, is now the commander of Akampan. Why are you needlessly putting Veerlakshmi on the scales? (Why are you creating doubt in Veerlakshmi's mind?)

**52.**  Your brother's daughter was rightfully given to your other brother. What insult have you suffered in this celebration? Your intolerance is the only insult. (Jayakumar is your brother because he is beneficial to you, just as Akampan is your brother. Your brother's daughter was rightfully given to your other brother. What insult have you suffered? If you cannot tolerate this, then that is your insult.)

**53.**  Besides Sulochana, there are many other daughters of kings. I will bring all of them here today, adorned with jewels, for you.

**54.**  These words, like a stream of water, increased the turmoil in his mind, like hot oil.

## Forty-Fourth Chapter

Hearing all this, Bharti, as if clarifying the confused, said, "This intellect is indeed in accordance with karma."

There is a tradition of Swayamvara, a long-standing custom for marriage. It is considered honorable, established by our ancestor, the venerable Rishabhadeva, and is also the wish of the elder, the unshakeable Akampan.

But this Akampan, driven by his affection for Jayakumar, desires his son's elevation and wants to establish the auspiciousness of his daughter's marriage.

He, the cunning one, has devised this deceit to make himself a Chakravarti, taking advantage of the gathering of all the kings.

He had previously advised Akampan to give his daughter to Jayakumar, and following that advice, he gave his daughter to Jayakumar. But to conceal this, he had the daughter, who was already pre-informed, falsely place the garland.

If I ignore this deception, which was initiated by the high-born Akampan at the beginning of the Yuga, it will not be rectified even at the end of the Kalpa.

Even for the Chakravarti, there is no punishment for preventing injustice. He also punishes me when I act unjustly.

This Jayakumar, emboldened by the heroic sash and now the garland, is becoming increasingly arrogant. He has found an opportunity and is already plotting against me.

I will destroy this enemy of all, root and branch, in battle, and thus generate a lasting love for me in the hearts of all the kings.

Whether my army splits into two or not, what does it matter to me? My arrows will pierce Jayakumar's chest and bring back the garland.

I do not desire Sulochana, for this envious Jayakumar, who is consumed by jealousy, will soon be dead by my arrows.

Adipuranam
By forbidding evil conduct, the three (Dharma, Artha, and Kama) increase. When the cause exists, how can the effect be lost? || 66 || 
There is no loss of my prowess in this endeavor, nor even a single arrow. Rather, there will be Dharma in killing the wicked, where is the sin? || 67 || 
My fame, the fame of the renowned Arka Kirti, will not be destroyed. But if I do not prevent this injustice, my infamy, which cannot be prevented, will surely arise. || 68 || 
You have cited the example of my infamy and his fame. If I become sluggish in this matter, your statement may be true. || 69 || 
Therefore, you all be silent, I am hot (angry) in this matter. Those who wish well should never forbid actions that increase Dharma, Artha, and fame. || 70 || 
Thus, the foolish Arka Kirti, who is close to defeat and stubborn, disregarded the minister and summoned the commander. He declared his intention to fight to all the kings and sounded the war drum, which filled the three worlds with fear. || 71-72 || 
The sound of the drum, along with the rapid dance of the warriors, the clash of their arms, the harsh sound of the bells ringing loudly on the elephants' necks, the roar of the lions, the neighing of the horses, the thunderous sound of the horses' hooves, the heavy sound of the earth from the footfalls of the infantry, the loud, terrifying sound of the wheels of the chariots, the harsh sound of the bowstring being drawn, the echoes reverberating through the walls of the directions, and the terrifying sound of all the drums, all combined to create a deafening roar of the army, as if it were about to devour time. || 73-77 ||

The forty-fourth chapter: The trained, strong, valiant warriors, mounted on valiant steeds, with flags flying, elephants prepared on all sides, like immovable mountains, were moving forward.  The horses, like waves of the sea of battle, adorned with armor, were following behind, neighing and galloping in all directions.  "Quickly attach the wheels, fix the axle, drive the horses," thus the chariots, with their swift horses and flying flags, were following behind.  The infantry, armed with bows, arrows, spears, lances, and chakras, were advancing behind the chariots, enraged and blocking all directions.  Elephants were pushing against elephants, horses against horses, chariots against chariots, and infantry against infantry, all rushing into battle.  Mounted on the magnificent Vijayghosh elephant, adorned with a chakra flag, and surrounded by valiant warriors, Arkakirti, like the sun with the constellations and Kulachala mountains, was advancing towards Achaladhip, the lord of the earth, as if the sun itself were moving towards Sumeru.  Knowing this, King Achaladhip was greatly distressed and thought, "Even a well-considered action can be overturned by fate."  Thus, after consulting with his ministers and Jayakumar, he quickly sent a messenger to Arkakirti.  The messenger said, "O Kumar, is it right for you to violate the boundaries? The time of destruction is far away, so be pleased. Do not be hasty."

Having understood that the king was pacified by the envoys' words, the envoy returned and reported all the news quickly and without hesitation. || 8 || Hearing this news, the king of Kashi, Akampan, was filled with sorrow and his mind became disturbed. He was overcome by great delusion. Who would not be bewildered by such a situation? || 10 || "We should not worry about this, because it is Arkakirti who has violated justice. You should stay here, vigilant and protecting Sulochana." || 11 || "Now, I will bind this wicked Arkakirti, who is eager to embrace chains, like a monkey, and bring him here." || 12 || Saying this, Jayakumar, filled with anger, ordered the war drum called Meghaghosha, which was won by the victory of the Meghakumars, to be sounded. || 13 || The sound of the drum, which was like the roar of the clouds, Drona, etc., that appear at the beginning of the apocalypse, spread everywhere, conquering and shattering the hearts of the enemies. || 14 || Hearing the sound of the drum, the army of Jayakumar, which was as vast and turbulent as the ocean, was filled with even greater joy than the joy of victory. || 15 || At that time, the elephants, who were intoxicated with their own pride and drank the nectar of their own madness, were adorned with the enthusiasm of battle, their temples torn and their trunks raised high. || 16 || Similarly, the horses, who were as swift as the wind, were also adorned with the enthusiasm of battle, neighing loudly, digging the sky with their hooves, and filled with energy. || 17 ||

365 chariots, as before, filled with all kinds of weapons, with great horses yoked to them, and with banners waving like dancing arms, spread out in all directions.  ||98||  Even the women, being skilled in battle, acted like warriors, so the infantry of Jayakumar was more numerous than that of other kings. ||99||  The sound of the drums was increasing, as if multiplying the excellence of the dance of the victorious Lakshmi, which was about to take place on the battlefield. ||100||

Then, mounted on the elephant Vijayardha, who was born in the forest, whose body was beautiful due to his age, education, and good qualities, who had a good disposition, a handsome body, was lustful, and whose pride was overflowing, who had seen many battles, who was adorned with elephant-shaped banners, and who resembled the other Vijayardha mountain, Jayakumar, along with all his army and younger brothers, departed, overcoming the play of the end of the age. ||101-103||

Meanwhile, the great king Akampan, who made his enemies tremble but remained unshakable himself, said to his daughter Sulochana, "Stay here with your mother and perform the peace-offering with reverence," and then took her to the excellent temple called Nityamanohar.  He himself, along with his sons, departed, shaking the earth with the weight of his entire army. ||104-105||

Sukethu, Suryamitra, Shridhara, Jayavarman, and Devakirti, all these kings, along with their armies, joined Jayakumar. ||106||

Among the crowned kings, those whose fame was widely known, such as the aforementioned Sukethu and the other five kings, as well as other brave warriors who were dependent on the Nath and Soma dynasties, all joined Jayakumar. ||107||

Manghaprabha, whose sharp sword's brilliance filled the sky, and who was skilled in knowledge, went forth with the Vidyadharas. ||108||

Dividing his army, Jayakumar, the destroyer of enemy forces, stood on the vast, even earth, adorned with the Makara formation, his voice as terrifying as the roar of a multitude of eagles, surpassing even the thunder of the clouds. 10-110

Arkakirti, standing amidst his massive army, shone like the sun, surrounded by his forces, having formed a Chakravyuha. 111

The lords of the Vidyadharas, led by Sunami, filled with rage, stood apart in the sky, having formed a Garuda formation, following the command of the Chakravarti's son. 112

Eight renowned Vidyadharas, known as Ashtachandra, intoxicated by their knowledge, served Arkakirti as bodyguards, surrounding him. 113

The sound of numerous drums echoed simultaneously, quickly overcoming the roar of the clouds, which had begun to rumble like the start of an untimely apocalypse. 114

The bow-wielding warriors, who were the vanguard of the battle, began to make their way forward with terrifying roars, clearing a path with their arrows. 115

The bow-wielding heroes, who were like the sutradharas in the beginning of this play of war, entered the battlefield, accompanied by the roar of drums. 116

The bowmen, having secured their positions in the battlefield, released a shower of sharp arrows, resembling a rain of flowers. 117

These sharp arrows, like wicked men, pierced the vital points of the enemy, always striking those who entered the battlefield. 118

A Vidyadhara named Meghaprabha, filled with arrogance, also set out with half of his Vidyadharas. 108

The forty-fourth chapter

Those archers, who had quivers strapped to both their sides, were strong and had conquered fatigue. They were adorned like birds in the sky. (116)

The arrows were like good ministers because they were straight, far-sighted, quick to accomplish tasks, and followed the path of the scriptures. (120)

Those arrows, which drank blood and flesh, carried feathers, traveled far, and had sharp points, fell upon their targets like birds. (121)

Just as purity, inspired by virtuous Dharma and residing in the heart, leads men to liberation, so too, the arrows, inspired by virtuous Dharma (the bow with its string) and piercing the heart, were leading the valiant men to the other world. (122)

Just as a courtesan, who has gained a place in the heart and possesses love or passion, closes the eyes of men with a mere touch, so too, the arrows, which have entered the heart and carry blood, close the eyes of men with a mere touch - they kill them. (123)

When there was a heavy downpour of rain from the clouds above and darkness enveloped the earth, the vulture, having abandoned its nest, was subdued by the power of the arrows, just like a woman is subdued by a lover. (124) 

Page #416:
---------------------------
## English Translation:

**368**

The arrows, guided by the hand, traveled far, following the gaze of their master. Like good servants, they fulfilled their master's wishes.  (125)

They aimed their sharp arrows, like Parashara's, directly at the enemy. The archers, with their bows, brought them down, striking the enemy's heart. (126)

Some arrows, engaged in breaking each other, were praised for their efforts in the battle, like servants. (127)

The arrows, released by strong hands, were not like indistinct targets. They pierced through the ranks of elephants, horses, chariots, and foot soldiers, reaching their designated spots. (128)

Just as kings, possessing the six qualities of diplomacy, alliance, etc., achieve success, so too did these arrows, possessing the six qualities, achieve success. Like kings who first make alliances, these arrows were first bound to the string. Like kings who remain in their position for a while, depending on the situation, these arrows remained on the bow for a while. Like kings who move from their position to engage in battle, these arrows moved from the bow to strike the enemy. Like kings who, as mediators, achieve a dual purpose, dividing the enemy's forces, these arrows, being in the middle (of the enemy's body), achieved a dual purpose, breaking the enemy into pieces. Finally, like kings who, when they are unable to fight, seek refuge with the enemy, these arrows, when they were unable to penetrate, sought refuge in the enemy's body. (130)

Just as a woman who has strayed from her husband seeks out and subdues another man, so too did the arrows, after the blood of the Vidyadharas had rained down and the darkness of vultures and birds had spread, seek out and subdue the enemy, abandoning their master. (124)

Or, these arrows were like good servants, going far and wide to accomplish their master's tasks. Just as good servants are straight and possess the qualities of a good group, so too were these arrows straight and possessed the qualities of a good string. Just as good servants are sustained by the food given to them in their hands, so too were these arrows released by the hand. Just as good servants follow the gaze of their master, so too did these arrows follow the gaze of their master. (125)

The archers, holding their bows, aimed their sharp arrows at the enemy's arrows, wherever they were. This was appropriate, for the enemy's intelligence was like that. (126)

The arrows that were released, held, or engaged in breaking each other's arrows were praised for their efforts in the battle, like servants. (127)

The arrows released by the warriors with strong hands were not like indistinct targets. They pierced through the ranks of elephants, horses, chariots, and foot soldiers, reaching their designated spots. (128)

Just as kings, possessing the six qualities of diplomacy, alliance, etc., achieve success, so too did these arrows, possessing the six qualities, achieve success.

**399** The stream of blood, like the flow of a hero's life force, flowed continuously, fueled by courage, as if it were a spring of water that had been uprooted. **(131)** Seeing the arrow that had pierced his beloved's heart, the man's heart was filled with sorrow, and he fell to the ground, as if saying, "My life is in his heart." **(132)** A warrior, pierced by arrows with broken shafts, which had penetrated his entire body, stood firm, his life force seemingly nailed down, and fought on with the same determination. **(133)** Seeing his army shattered by the enemy's archers, whose arrows were like the blazing flames of the fire of destruction, Jayakumar, filled with anger, took up his bow, Vajrakanḍa, and prepared to fight. **(134-135)**

His arrows, like the perfect messengers, were drawn close to his ear, just as a messenger stands close to his master's ear to deliver a message. They were equipped with strings, just as a messenger is equipped with the qualities of secrecy and loyalty. They were carefully planned, just as a messenger's mission is carefully planned. They were swift, with feathers that propelled them forward, just as a messenger carries a message with speed. They wasted no time, just as a messenger does not waste time. They flew straight, just as a messenger travels on a straight path. And just as a messenger enters the heart of the enemy and accomplishes the most difficult tasks, so too did these arrows penetrate the hearts of the enemy and achieve the impossible. **(136-137)**

**140.**  Just as a debater, desiring swift fame, conquers with superior arguments, so too, a warrior, desiring victory, repels the opposing force with weapons and scriptures.

**141.**  The birds, soaring through the sky, attacked the other birds, and did not return until they fell, struck by fear.

**142.**  With extremely sharp vision, fierce, and blazing on all sides, the arrows, released from the sky, fell like thunderbolts on the heads of the warriors.

**143.**  The warriors, covered in a shower of arrows, shrouded in darkness by the wings of vultures, were struck from the sky, unable to see the blows of the maces.

**144.**  In this age, those sharp arrows first brought about untimely death. It is fitting, for what evil deeds are not done by those who have diminished the brilliance of the sun?

**145.**  Not to go far, but to strike with force, the celestial beings, drawing their arrows to their ears, killed many elephants and other creatures.

**146.**  Just as sinners, drinking blood and eating flesh, turn their faces downwards and go to hell, so too, the celestial beings, struck by the arrows, fell to the earth, their faces downwards.

"The arrows, released by the cruel earth-dwellers, pierced the enemies, drinking their blood and eating their flesh, and fell to the ground. || 146 || The arrows, released by the earth-dwellers, pierced the enemies and went far into the sky, like the messengers of the divine women. || 147 || The wheel of the Chakravarti is one, and it does not harm anyone, but in that battle, many beings were killed by many wheels, like the wheels of time. || 148 || The arrows, released by the Vidhyadharas and the earth-dwellers, with equal speed, stood in the sky, face to face, for a while. || 149 || The sky was covered with the arrows of the Vidhyadharas and the earth-dwellers, who were blocking each other, and because they could not see each other, their battle stopped. || 150 || Seeing his army wounded by the weapons of his own and the enemy, and the arrows of the Vidhyadharas, Jayakumar, who was like Yama, enraged for destruction, threw his eye-like fiery weapon towards the sky, and prepared to fight with the Vajrakanda bow, like Indra. || 151-152 || The sound of Jayakumar's bowstring, which defeated the roar of the thunderbolt, frightened many enemies, who threw away their bows, arrows, and hearts. || 153 || Jayakumar, who drew his bow to his ear, placed the arrow on the string, and released the arrows with great speed, seemed to be not striking, for a moment, that is, he was not shooting arrows. || 154 || The arrows released by Jayakumar were not seen in the middle, nor in the bodies, only the enemies lying on the ground with wounds were seen. || 155 || The arrows of Jayakumar, who closed the eyes of those who saw them, burned everyone, and were as terrifying as a group of meteors, covered the faces of the directions. || 156 ||"

**156** Seeing the fallen Vidyadharas outside the battlefield, scattered by the sharp stones of the Tiryanch, the foolish people said, "Look, the Vidyadharas have gone to heaven with their bodies."

**157** The jewels falling from the shattered crowns of the Vidyadharas, wounded by arrows, seemed as if they were being offered to Jayakumar by the gods, who are captivated by virtues.

**158** Seeing the women, accompanied by the fallen, dead Vidyadharas, offering them water-like tears, Jayakumar was filled with compassion.

**159** "Yama is impartial," they say, but if that were true, why would he be the king of the dead only in the army of Chakra's son, Arkkirti? Why would he favor his army?

**160** By killing the unjust, Jayakumar, in his victory, became like the divine fire of Dharma, even though Yama is known for his sharpness. 

**161**  At that moment, the horses of Chakra's son, Arkkirti, came forward, roaring with their neighing, encouraging their own army.

**162** The warriors of Yama, like the vanguard of his army, came forward, brandishing their sharp spears, rotating them repeatedly.

**163** Jayakumar, the victor, mounted his horse, Jayaturangam, and, filled with anger, ordered his cavalry to fight with their spears.

**164** The sea of soldiers, with its surging waves of horses, was like a thunderous roar, with the sound of drums and other instruments.

The forty-fourth chapter: The fire of battle blazed fiercely, sparked by the clash of swords, amidst a terrifying storm of arrows. The earth was scorched. (166) The horses, driven by the sting of the whips, ran towards the shower of arrows. They could not bear defeat, for they were valiant. (167) Standing on their hind legs, filled with rage, they fought each other, some of them protecting their masters for a long time. (168) The sky, adorned with the fluttering, blood-stained swords, resembled a tree adorned with new leaves. (169) Some horses, their backs empty, ran far and wide, searching for their masters, their heads raised high, as if seeking them after being struck by the swords. (170) No one killed the horses, considering them as hornless animals, but they, enraged, attacked each other with their teeth and hooves. (171) Many warriors, filled with rage, fought for a long time with their swords, which were like unbroken iron rods, only a bamboo length remaining. (172) Another warrior, blinded by a blow to the head, could not see, but seeing the neck connected to the head, he continued to fight. (173) Many warriors, aided by their horses, fought valiantly with their bows, called Kapishirshaka, doubling the intensity of the battle. (174) Then, Jayakumar, with his sword in hand, appeared like Yama, with his younger brothers, mounted on a lion-like horse, and charged forward with rage. (175) Seeing Jayakumar, as terrifying as the fire of the final age, mounted on his horse, the enemy's horses, like waves, retreated into their ocean of soldiers. (176)

- 19.  The chariots, like swift winds, surged forward, their wheels churning the battlefield, their arrows a dense curtain, blocking the enemy's attack. ||19||

- 16. The clash of weapons from both armies created a fiery inferno. How could the valiant endure such heat? ||16||

212. Who, with pride, were eager to conquer even lions, and who were messengers of victory, 
213. With elephants, whose vastness resembled dark clouds, 
214. Whose arrows, falling from all sides, resembled flocks of peacocks, 
215. Whose swords, raised high, flashed like lightning, 
216. Whose deep roars of many drums resembled the thunder of clouds, 
217. Whose earth was covered with a flood of fresh blood, 
218. Whose relentless blows of maces resembled a shower of thunderbolts, 
219. Whose sky was covered with white banners like flocks of herons, 
220. That battle, at that time, was enhancing the full glory of the rainy season. 
221. For a long time, in the battlefield surrounded by a multitude of warriors, there was a frequent exchange of weapons between the two armies. 
222. At that time, the sky above was filled with a multitude of vultures, the middle part was filled with fluttering banners, and the earth was filled with weapons abandoned by both armies. 
223. At that time, Jayakumar, desiring to make Jayalakshmi the new rival of the newly married Sulochana, advanced his elephant, aiming for the fame of Arka. 
224. Just as the karma of the ascetics who ride on the क्षपक श्रेणी (a type of celestial vehicle) obstructs them, so too, the eight-moon-like Vidyadharas, whose powers were seen before, came forward again,

and
Even though the enemy was obtained after a long time, he shone brightly. Just as fire, fueled by abundant fuel, blazes brightly, so too, Jayakumar, fueled by the wind of enthusiasm, was shining brightly after obtaining the enemy. ||221|| At that time, many kingly lions, seated on the peaks of the famous elephant-mountains, began to fight each other. ||222|| In that battle, two elephants, their tusks broken by each other's blows, were found dead, standing on each other's bases like two mountains. ||223|| The elephant-kings, covered with arrows from all sides, were shining in that battle, like moving mountains, filled with small bamboo groves. ||224|| Those who are generous, whose pride is overflowing, who are noble, who are tall, who are like Yama, and who are greater than all beings, why would such noble elephants not fight? ||225|| Just as deer flee in fear, so too, the elephant-kind, defeated from the very beginning, fled in fear, and by doing so, they crushed their own army. Therefore, it must be said that the bulk of those with cowardly hearts is to be condemned. ||226|| The powerful warriors were defeating the powerless with their weapons called "Shakti," and they were also defeating the powerful warriors who did not have the weapon called "Shakti," making them powerless. They were taking away their weapons called "Shakti" from those who had them but were themselves powerless. Therefore, the Acharya says that the lack of essential resources is to be condemned. ||227|| Those whose entire bodies are torn apart by weapons, whose eyes are closed, who have completely restrained their desire for battle, who have shown their prowess, who have tied their palyanka-asana with their minds, and who have abandoned all possessions, how many such

## Forty-fourth Chapter

The anger of some was extinguished and the remembrance of the Supreme Being arose. "What is not achieved by practice? Even in the last moments of life, steadfastness is attained." (230)

Their hearts were pierced by arrows, blood flowed from their mouths, their intestines were pulled out by jackals, and their limbs were torn apart. Many warriors, rendered unconscious by the wind from the wings of vultures, regained some consciousness and, embracing pure faith, attained the heroic path to heaven. (231-232)

The battlefield was adorned with the blooming lotus-like faces of the valiant warriors, their heads severed by the chakra weapon. It was as if it was adorned by the dances of the victory goddess of Jayakumar. (233)

Overwhelmed by the great favors bestowed by their master, such as respect and honor, many servants attained liberation by serving their master with their lives. Many blessed servants, satisfied with the sacrifice of their lives, obtained the worship of their masters by killing the enemy kings and became debt-free. (Meaning: Many servants died fighting, and many achieved their purpose by killing the enemies.) (234-235)

The arrows released by Jayakumar, who had not given up on victory and who resembled shooting stars with their great brilliance, were falling upon the eight Chandra Vidyadharas simultaneously. (236)

Those Vidyadharas, with their knowledge, stopped the rows of weapons released by Jayakumar. Therefore, they stood burning around him, appearing as if a circular boundary was surrounding the moons. (237)

At that time, the son of the first emperor, Bharat, Arkakirti, said to Sunami, the lord of all Vidyadharas, with great anger, "Destroy all the enemies!" (238)

And Sunami, the destroyer of the enemies' power, began to shower arrows like a rain of fire in the sky. (239)

## Adipurana 1314, 73

**240.**  They are fearsome, like servants, making noise due to their speed, and having blocked all directions.  These sharp arrows, what are we not destroying?  That is, thinking that they will destroy everyone, they are falling upon the entire army.

**241.** Just as a lion attacks an elephant, so too the very powerful Vidyaadhara named Meghaprabha, by the command of Jayakumar, attacked Sunami and stopped him in the sky with weapons.

**242.** Meghaprabha, with the help of Sunami's weapons, destroyed the Tamobaan, Agnibaan, Gajabaan, and Meghabaan, etc., which were filled with Vidya, by quickly destroying them with the Surya baan, Jalabaan, Singhabaan, and Vayubaan, etc., which were filled with Vidya.

**243.** Thus, in that battle, Meghaprabha, by the auspicious rise of Jayakumar, quickly conquered Sunami, the lord of the Vidyaadharas.  It is right, because when one is favored by the gods, there is no difference between smallness and greatness.  **Meaning:** When one is favored by fate, even the small can win, and the great can lose.

**244.** Like a mountain of clouds gathered at the beginning of the rainy season, Jayakumar, on the side of Arkakeerti, stopped the army of elephants.

**245.** On the other hand, Jayakumar, who was brave and noble, with his excellent elephant named Vijayardha, obtained by anger, went before the brave and arrogant Arkakeerti and began to speak to him.

**246.** He said, "All the paths of justice are properly followed by the Chakravarti, but these wicked people have made you an enemy of those paths of justice."

**247.** "O Kumar, although you are intelligent, being of an 'Ahaaraya Buddhi' (one who acts according to what others say) is also your fault.  Besides this, you are siding with the wicked or wicked men, which is your third fault."

**248.** "These wicked people have unnecessarily aroused great anger in your heart, which is causing the destruction of all the forces of King Bharat."

This battle between us must end today, for it will bring lasting infamy to both of us. 
246
The Chakravarti considers you the most worthy of his sons to rule. Would he not be pained by your injustice?
250
I will bind all these wicked men, along with the Vidyadharas, who have betrayed the righteous path of the King Bharata, and deliver them to you this very moment.
251
I request you to stay here for a moment, mounted on your elephant, for it is a disgrace for a great man to commit injustice, not to abandon it.
252
Kumar, the greatest loss in this battle will be yours, for who, in their right mind, would strike their own soul with a sharp sword?
253
Just as an unworthy being does not listen to the right Dharma, so too did Arka-kirti not heed Jayakumar's words and began to have his elephant attack Jayakumar's noble elephant.
254
At that time, Jayakumar, who was highly skilled in elephant warfare, became very angry. With his victorious elephant, he struck Arka-kirti and the eight Chandra Vidyadharas with nine blows of his tusks, wounding them.
255
The nine elephants of Arka-kirti and the eight Chandra Vidyadharas, enraged, were wounded by the nine blows of the victorious elephant's tusks and fell to the ground.
256
When Jayakumar, desiring battle, surrounded Arka-kirti's army on all sides, it was as if the day itself was setting, protecting his life.
257
He who surpasses the brilliance of the jasmine flower with his own radiance, who has withdrawn all his rays, who appears as if the arrows that Jayakumar had released against the Vidyadharas were all stained with their flowing blood and had entered his body, whose entire glory has been destroyed, who is cruel and displeasing to all eyes, that wicked one...

## The Adi Purana, Chapter 3, Verse 95

The sun, considering his own glory as equal to that of Arka Kirti, became angry and set, delaying the victory of Jayakumar. ||261||

Even though the sun, whose light is clear and who is virtuous, set, it is only right. For who, even if he is a drinker of wine, does not go down? ||262||

From his rising, his radiance increased, and he spread his heat over the world. But even this powerful sun was destroyed in a single day. Then who else, who is more powerful and brings more suffering, can remain in the world? ||263||

The clear lakes, which dispel heat, did not want to see the sun, who had lost his radiance. So they closed their lotus-like eyes in sorrow. ||264||

The birds entered their own nests, as if they were unable to see the celestial beings who had fallen from the sky, struck by Jayakumar's sharp sword. ||265||

The sun has extraordinary power, extraordinary radiance, and is worshipped by all in an extraordinary way. Yet, he falls every day. This shows that the cruel fate is not subject to reason. ||266||

The group of wise men said, "When the sun, who was equal to Arka Kirti, became invisible, what can be said about the one who is being compared?" ||267||

**Verse 26:**  He is difficult to behold, with sharp, scorching rays, his own sphere ablaze. He is the destroyer of the lotus, his son is evil, and only fools praise him.

**Verse 269:** He is helpless, without support, unable to bear the brilliance of the celestial bodies. He is in the sign of Leo, fickle, cruel, and suddenly leaps to the head.

**Verse 27:** He is diseased with sin, dependent on others, and travels an uneven path in the sky. He is red-rayed, hates all, his desires are insatiable, and he rushes ahead without order.

**Verse 271:** Even with wise friends like Mercury and Jupiter, this king with many flaws is incurable, like a patient who is about to die. He is evil, and no one can look at him. He is harsh because he levies excessive taxes, and he brings suffering even to his own family. He is the destroyer of the earth, his son is wicked, and only fools praise him. He is without allies, without a stronghold, and cannot bear the brilliance of other powerful kings. He was born in the sign of Leo, is fickle, cruel, and suddenly leaps to the head. He is intolerant, afflicted with many diseases, and follows the dictates of others. He travels an unjust path, is red-rayed, hates everyone, his desires are insatiable, and he rushes ahead without order. This king with many flaws, like a patient with an incurable disease, is doomed to destruction even with wise friends and a virtuous teacher.

**Verse 272:** At that time, the ministers of both armies, seeing the anger of the two kings, went to them and stopped them from fighting, saying that it was against dharma to fight at night.

**Verse 273:** The two kings, overwhelmed by the unbearable pain of their wounded soldiers and the terrifying cries of battle, decided to spend the night on the battlefield itself.

The Adi Purana states: 'The west swallowed the sun, as if it were angry with the one from whom I was born.' (27) 'I am ashamed to be seen with the sun, so the evening, taking on a form, followed the sun.' (275) 'The sun, having taken me forward, left me behind when it went to the night. The evening, overwhelmed with sorrow, disappeared.' (276) 'The darkness, which had been hidden in caves and other places during the day, spread everywhere. Wise people do not leave their enemies alive, they destroy them completely.' (277) 'Just as the sky had previously made space for the light, so it made space for the darkness. This greatness of the sky is to be condemned.' (278) 'Just as in the Kali Yuga, the absence of the Jina leads to the spread of the influence of many fools due to ignorance, so at that time, the absence of the sun led to the spread of the light of many lamps and other things due to darkness.' (279) 'The moon rose, as if the Creator had lifted a silver pitcher filled with nectar to awaken the world, which was blinded by darkness.' (280) 'The moon was drinking the thick darkness with its rays, as if it were smoking to cure a cough or a wasting disease.' (281) 'The moon was unable to destroy all the darkness. This is because one whose sphere is impure and who is without power cannot destroy enemies.' (282) 'The lotuses in the ponds were blooming profusely from the touch of the moon's rays, as if they were looking at the moon with their blooming lotus-like eyes.' (283)

There, seeing her beloved, a woman, pierced by the arrows of enemies, herself became lifeless, though her body was not wounded by the arrows of love. ||293|| Seeing her beloved, whose limbs were not marked by wounds, another woman, not knowing, thought that the wounds were inflicted by herself, and, realizing this, she became lifeless. ||294|| O beloved, you were very dear to Vira-Lakshmi, and therefore, even though I stopped you, you went to her. Now, you are in this state because of the cruel wounds of Vira-Lakshmi. Saying this, another woman died. ||295|| Beloved, I was coming with you at that time, but you stopped me and came here to accept Kirti. Although you knew that Kirti is always roaming around (promiscuous), you were deluded into thinking that she is pure. Now, see, Kirti has remained there. Alas, do men know the heart or separation? Saying this, another woman, filled with jealousy, went to the path of her beloved, that is, she died seeing her beloved dead. ||296-297|| O beloved, why did I, a fool, not come with you even though I was stopped? Do these low-born courtesans (celestial nymphs) take you away while I am near you? Well, what is gone is gone. Can't I still go there and snatch you from them? Saying this, a woman with a sweet voice followed her beloved, that is, she also died. ||298-299|| A warrior, whose whole body was pierced by arrows, and whose life was hanging by a thread, was waiting for his beloved to come. ||300|| Seeing her beloved, whose lips were bitten in anger, another woman, filled with momentary anger and jealousy towards Vira-Lakshmi, gave up her life. ||301|| A warrior, whose heart was pierced by an arrow, thinking that his beloved was in his heart, said, "Alas, this noble woman is dead. Someone has taken away her life." ||302||

At that time, the sound of millions of trumpets rising simultaneously in both armies filled all directions. || 312 || Although the moon is with the west, the sun will rise with me.

The forty-fourth chapter.  The eight Chandra Vidyadharas, who have made the moon their friend, are not like the moon in battle.  They are marked with a flag like a comet, which indicates their ill-fate.  Their speed is destroyed by the strong wind blowing against them.  They are like arrows that strike the midday sun, causing wounds to the mind.  Jay, who is like a blazing fire and whom the enemy cannot even see, came upon him with great pride, like a calf, driven by the cruel trade of elephant catchers, to its place of confinement.  Jay, who is like a cloud, filled with a multitude of arrows, also came forward, making the sun-like glory of Arka Kirti devoid of light, and cutting through the arrows released by the enemy.  His arrows ran ahead of him, like the rays of the sun at sunrise.  Jay, who is difficult to conquer, cut through the umbrella, weapons, and flag of Arka Kirti, with the desire to destroy his arrogance.  The eight Chandras, coming forward with their knowledge and strength, stopped the arrows of Jay, like clouds stopping the rays of the sun.  Bhujabali and others, with their younger brothers, came forward to fight Hemaangad with great anger, like a group of lions attacking another group of lions.  Anant Sen, with his younger brothers, also came forward to face the younger brothers of Jay, like a herd of elephants from Angaradesh attacking a herd of elephants from Kalingadesh.  Other kings, filled with anger, attacked other kings, like Kulachala mountains moving against other Kulachala mountains.  There is no power in these people to be defeated, for Jay is ready for battle, like a snake that has made a friend of its enemy.

Knowing the tremor of the battle, Jayakumar, with great respect, received the serpent's noose and the crescent-shaped arrow from his friend, the serpent-god, who had come to him, knowing the news from the trembling of his seat. ||33-335|| Taking that arrow, which shone like a thousand suns, Jayakumar placed it on his bow, Vajrakanda. ||336|| Knowing that the son of the Chakravarti would surely be killed by this arrow, the rulers of the human and vidyadhara realms were greatly distressed. ||337|| That arrow, like a thunderbolt, consumed nine chariots, eight crescent-shaped arrows, and all the weapons along with their charioteers. ||338|| Arkkirti, whose pride was broken, stood like an elephant whose tusks were broken, or like Yama, whose weapons were destroyed, unable to act. Therefore, one must curse this act of the gods that brought such sorrow. ||339|| Just as a man skilled in strategy, though weaponless, captures a valiant warrior by seizing his feet with a noose and his teeth, so Jayakumar captured Arkkirti. ||340|| To fight before being scorned is valor, but to fight after being scorned, out of arrogance, is a second scorn. ||341|| Although Arkkirti had a noble lineage, a Chakravarti father, the position of a prince, and a vast army, he suffered this fate. This shows that evil conduct afflicts everyone. ||342|| The Chakravarti had bound Jayakumar with a warrior's belt, but he, in turn, made the son of the Chakravarti a place for bandages. Look at this reversal of fortune! ||343|| Jayakumar, the conqueror of all enemies, placed Arkkirti, who was like a moth flying towards fire and weaponless, in his chariot, and mounted a tall elephant himself, and like a lion, he subdued the enemy vidyadhara kings with the serpent's noose, like Varuna. ||344||

The forty-fourth chapter. When the fierce battle related to Sulochana was pacified, then a shower of flowers fell from the five celestial trees of heaven.  The victory-goddess, born from the victory of Arkkirti, the son of his invincible lord (Bharata), did not belong to Jayakumar's pride, but on the contrary, she embraced him with shame.  "This victory has come from a battle fought at an inappropriate time," due to this shame, his fame, as if driven away by Jayakumar, reached the ends of the directions at that time.  Just as powerful men capture the leader of a herd of wild elephants and hand him over to the king, so Jayakumar, having bound many kings, handed over Arkkirti to the great king Akampan.  Then, riding on the shoulder of the huge, intoxicated elephant named Vijayardha, he set out to see the battlefield, scorning the sun-disk situated on the peak of Udayachal.  Seeing the battlefield from all sides, he was greatly astonished.  He had the dead cremated and made arrangements for the well-being of the living.  Thus, Jayakumar, whose glory was manifest, entered the city of Kashi, which was adorned with the splendor of all, along with Meshprabha and others.  Akampan, too, surrounded by hundreds of princes and kings as fierce as lions, entered the city, and with the help of men skilled in pacifying, he reassured the many bound kings and Arkkirti, and placed them in their proper places.  Thinking that the destruction of all obstacles is due to the grace of the Arhant, all of them went to the shrine called Nityamanohar to pay their respects.  From afar, they dismounted from their vehicles, entered the temple with peaceful minds, circumambulated, and praised the Jina with hymns full of meaning. 

Page #440:

The glorious Jayakumar, who has attained victory, praised the Lord of the Universe, the Jina, with a heart filled with devotion, saying: "O Lord, who destroys all obstacles, even a small praise offered to you becomes significant, just as a drop of water in a conch shell becomes a pearl. " (357) "O Lord, the crores of obstacles that are skilled in giving fruit cannot give any fruit to those who reside near your feet, just as those who live in the middle of the ocean are never afraid of fire." (359) "O Lord, when you are enshrined in the heart, who are the enemies who can wish to harm us? How can there be any disturbance caused by poison in those who constantly consume nectar?" (360) "Those who are righteous, who preach the path of Dharma and are the enemies of Kamadeva, and who take refuge in the great Vrishabhadeva, receive all prosperity and their calamities are completely destroyed." (361) "O Jina, who bestows blessings with your radiant qualities, the karmic bonds of those who wish to lead you on the path of supreme devotion are destroyed even before they are born, and later, the eternal liberation, the supreme bliss, is attained without being asked for."

The one who is drenched in sweat, who is ashamed, whose sense of "I am the master of all" has been destroyed, whose mind is bewildered, and who is contemplating the course of fate, such was the state of Arkkakoti, who was overwhelmed with grief at the separation from Vīralakṣmī. ||363||
I worship with great love those whom this victorious Jayakumāra, who conquers the gods, assists in battle. If he is the most important of all, then why delay? Thinking thus, victory-Lakṣmī, as if, came to Jayakumāra very quickly. ||364||
Thus, the dust of the enemy, which had risen from the shower of arrows, was quickly destroyed by his prowess, and Jayakumāra, who had attained the position of a lion, and who now desired the union with the maiden, was shining very brightly, like the sun, who, being in the sign of Leo, desires to enter the sign of Virgo. ||365||

Then, Mangasvara, having achieved his first victory and destroyed the pride of his enemies, resided in his vast palace. ||1||

The great king Akampan, desiring to destroy his own accumulated sins, praised the Jinesvara. Seeing Sulochana, who had taken a vow to abstain from food until the end of the war, standing near her mother, Supribha, who was engaged in the practice of Kayotsarga, meditating on peace, with a steady mind, focused and joyful in the presence of the Jinesvara, he honored her, reassured her, and praised her virtues many times. He said, "Daughter, by your greatness, all inauspiciousness has been pacified, all sins have been destroyed. Now, relax your vows." Having said this, with folded hands, he honored Sulochana, and accompanied by his sons and Queen Supribha, entered the royal palace. Then, saying, "Daughter, go to your palace," he dismissed Sulochana. ||2-7||

This task was planned differently, and the king executed it differently. Confused about what to do, the wise king Akampan, with his excellent ministers like Sushruta, pondered over the different types of knowledge, such as that arising from birth, vows, rules, medicines, and austerities. He then released the Vidhyadhara kings, who had been bound by the serpent's noose. Knowing the right course of action, he reassured them all with words that were the essence of truth, and honored them with baths, clothes, seats, and other things. ||8-10||

He then said to Arka Kirti, "O Kumar, our lineage, the Soma lineage, has been established by the victory of our ancestors. From which man was this victory born? From which man was this lineage born?" ||11||

**14.** From where has this offense come from us, who are devoid of wisdom? We are your relatives and servants, O Kumar, you should forgive this offense.

**15.** This infamy and sin will be pacified by your grace, for you are capable of both cursing and blessing, therefore, please purify us.

**16.** The darkness of the world is destroyed by the sun, which removes the darkness. You are the sun for us, therefore, remove the darkness from our hearts.

**17.** Just as a mother's milk is essential for a child's survival, so too is your favor essential for our survival. This opposition that has arisen for us due to the special manifestation of our past life's karmas is like a child's opposition to his mother's milk.

The 35th chapter of the text is about food. It says that just as food is essential for life, so is the happiness of the Lord. Without his happiness, we cannot live. We are like servants who are sent out to do his work, and he is like the ocean, whose vastness cannot be contained. We are fortunate to have survived his wrath, and we should be grateful for his mercy. He is like water, which sustains all life. Just as fire heats water, so has someone angered him against us. Now, he should become cool like water. If he does not want to be peaceful, then he should accept his sons and daughters and protect them. I will go to the shelter of the feet of Shri Vrishabhdev. 

Thus, the Lord made Arkakirti happy, satisfied, and mounted him on a fine elephant, placing him at the front of the procession. For eight days, he performed a peace puja with great pomp and ceremony, culminating in a grand abhisheka, to appease all sins. Akampan, who knew the rituals of reconciliation, summoned Jayakumar and brought about a reconciliation between them, creating a deep love and an unbreakable unity. Then, he gave Arkakirti a daughter named Akshamala, along with great wealth and all kinds of riches. He honored him greatly and accompanied him for a short distance before bidding him farewell. Similarly, he honored other kings of the Bhoomigocharis and Vidyadharas, giving them precious jewels, elephants, and horses, and then quickly sent them off. 

Those who were ashamed of their injustice and whose enmity had been dispelled, all returned to their own cities. This is right, for wisdom is that which quickly retaliates against a crime committed by fate.

Then the previously mentioned god came and, with great wealth, arranged the auspicious marriage of Sulochana. ||32|| Jayakumar, beloved by all, also sent away all his good helpers, including Meghaprabha, Suketu, and others, with gifts. ||33|| 
Aakampana, the head of the Nath dynasty, a very wise man, consulted with his son-in-law Jayakumar and, having gathered the best jewels from his house as gifts, sent a messenger named Sumukha to the Chakravarti, saying, "You know all the current news. Do what will please the Chakravarti." ||34-35|| 
The messenger quickly went and first announced his arrival. Then, seeing the Chakravarti, he prostrated himself on the ground, bowed, and, with folded hands, presented the gifts he had brought, saying, "O God, Aakampana, the king, is your follower. He bows and, out of fear, requests your favor. Please listen to him." ||36-37|| 
He said, "I had a daughter named Sulochana, a most excellent girl. I gave her to Jayakumar, whose wealth and beauty you yourself have increased, through the process of a Swayamvara." ||38|| 
Kumar Arkakirti also came to that Swayamvara and first accepted everything. He stood there, pleased, along with the Vidyaadhara kings. ||39|| 
Then, just as a wicked planet, staying with a good planet, makes it wicked, so too did some wicked person, by force, unjustly anger them. ||40|| 
You already know everything that happened there, because even an ordinary king, who has spies as his eyes, knows everything. What can I say, you are a knower of the future. ||41|| 
The Kumar is still a boy, he has no fault. We, who are careless, are the ones who are at fault. ||42||

"We did not offer her to him to be taken as his wife," said the messenger. "It is the fault of the worshipper, not the deity, that the gods are angered." 
43
"These are all my own creations, my own creations, my own brothers, and they are always affectionate towards me. How can I punish them? Do not think that way, because if your son were guilty, you would punish him too. This is the beginning of justice, and it began with you. Therefore, O Lord, command us what punishment we deserve for this offense. Should we be hanged? Should we be tortured? Or should our wealth be confiscated?"
44-46
"O God, by obeying your commands, we will be blessed in this world and the next. Therefore, punish us according to our offense."
47
Thus, speaking words that were humble and pleasing to the heart, the handsome messenger fell silent at the gesture of the Emperor Chakravarti.
48
If the words of the righteous can even captivate the minds of demons, what can be said of the peaceful minds of great men like Bharata, who see all beings equally?
49
With a cheerful expression, the Emperor, whose face was like a blooming lotus, said to the messenger, "Why did Maharaja Akampan send you here? He is like our father, and he is the eldest among us all."
50-51
"In the household, he is our revered elder, and I am his brother. What else can be said? He will stop me from going down the path of injustice."
52
"Just as Lord Vrishabhadeva is the guru for those who follow the path of liberation in this age, and King Shreyans is the guru for those who follow the tradition of charity, and I am the leader of the Chakravartis, so too, he is the guru for those who follow the tradition of the Swayamvara. If Maharaja Akampan were not here, who else would have continued this ancient tradition of the Swayamvara?"

Those who make the ancient paths, hidden by the land of enjoyment, new, are worthy of worship by the virtuous. 55. My renowned kingship did not come from a wheel, nor from other jewels, nor from treasures, nor from a six-limbed army, nor from sons, nor from myself, but only from one Jayakumar, for in all deeds of valor, my victory came from him. 56-57. By conquering the Mlechcha kings, he established my glorious name on the Nabhi mountain, what has anyone else done in this matter? 58. This Arkakoti has spread my infamy, worthy of being counted among infamies, and lasting like a black gram, throughout the world as long as the moon exists. 59. He has not only followed the path of injustice, but has also made himself the chief among those who are worthy of punishment from the world. 60. Just as collyrium is produced from a lamp, so this infamy has arisen from me, this is not Arkakoti, but indeed infamy itself. 61. Jayakumar, by my command, punishes those who are inclined towards injustice, therefore, the punishment he has given him in battle is well done. 62. What else? If even the eldest son is guilty, the king should punish him, I am ready today to follow this path of righteousness on Arkakoti. 63. You have given the daughter named Akshamala to that arrogant one without thinking, this is bad. 64. Or, by giving the famous Akshamala as a gift, you have also given Arkakoti respect, that is right, because he is tainted, is the moon's form abandoned because it is tainted? 65. But the Chakravarti, even though his son committed a crime, ignored him - did not punish him, this infamy of mine has been made permanent by the great Akampan. 66. Thus, having appeased the Lord of the Universe, with a pleasant face and a pleasant demeanor, abandoning the eldest son, he made the son born of a concubine the heir according to the law of the fish. 67.

Chapter Forty-Three

Su-mukha, unable to bear the weight of the king's favor, said, "O Dev, Jay and Akampan, who have received your grace, both bow to your feet." Saying this, he prostrated himself before the king, placing all his limbs on the ground. Then, rising with his lotus-like face blooming and hands clasped in prayer, he said, "Just as two chatakas yearn for rain from the first cloud of the rainy season, so too, Jay and Akampan yearn for my arrival and are eagerly awaiting me." Having thus informed the Chakravarti, he was granted permission and, with great speed, went to Akampan and Jay, paying them due respect.  

He then revealed the king's favor with words, and the two kings, their lotus-like faces blooming like the sun at dawn, were filled with joy. They showered him with praise, gifts, and honor.  "It is fitting that kings, being grateful, should be so delighted," they said. 

Thus, Jay, whose auspicious deeds were illuminated by the attainment of unparalleled glory, lived happily in his father-in-law's house.  His eyes, like bees on the lotus-like face of Sulochana, were captivating. His body, like a quiver for the arrows of the great god of love, was adorned with weapons.  

And when the battle began, he was not wounded by arrows, just as the delicate god of love is not wounded by the arrows of flowers.  For the play of fate is indeed strange.  

He made Sulochana, who was devoid of smiles, smile. He made her laugh heartily when she was not laughing. He made her fearless when she was afraid. He calmed her when she was troubled.

The Adipurana states that Jayakumar, driven by the desire to see his people, informed his father-in-law, "My relatives and friends wish to see me. I have come to inform you of my departure."  Upon hearing this, Akampan, the king of the Nath dynasty, was slightly troubled.  For who would not be distressed when their own Jay (Jayakumar or Vijay) expresses a desire to leave?  After considering the course of action, the king said, "So be it."  Indeed, wise men, like a lamp, follow the path of affection (oil or love).  Although Akampan had already given Jayakumar everything by giving him Sulochana, he still followed the customs of the world and gave him all his wealth, including the treasury, to express his love.  On an auspicious day, he bid farewell to the bride and groom.  The great king Akampan, along with his wife, accompanied them for a distance, then, with a heavy heart, turned back.  For the separation from a child is unbearable.  Jayakumar, mounted on the elephant Vijay, along with Sulochana, and all his younger brothers, including Vijay and Hemaangadkumar, rode on other elephants.  With great festivity, he told stories, jokes, and pleasant tales, shaking the earth.  Like the moon surrounded by stars, he slowly moved along the banks of the Ganges, just as he had done during his previous conquest.  Jayakumar, the learned and ruler of all, saw a suitable place on the banks of the Ganges, with grass, and set up camp.  The entrance to the camp, near the countless tents of shining cloth, was wide and spacious.

The Forty-Fifth Chapter

43. Reaching the Sindhu river, he halted his elephant at the royal gate. Dismounting from the elephant, he entered the inner enclosure and seated himself there. Placing his beloved Sulochana, who was supported by his arms, in a suitable place, he made himself comfortable on a soft bed. 

110. Knowing the appropriate activities for the time, he pleased his beloved with enjoyable things like bathing, eating, conversation, music, dance, and entertainment. 

111. Spending the night happily there, he explained the reason for his stay. After reassuring her, he placed her in the care of Hemaangad and the others. 

112. He appointed all his younger brothers to properly guard the army and, accompanied by a few trusted men, he set out for Ayodhya. 

113. Welcomed by the likes of Arka-kirti upon his arrival, he was greeted with great affection and respect. Engaging in conversation with Arka-kirti, the king, Jayakumar, entered the city of Ayodhya, accompanied by his devoted followers, filled with love. For who else would not pay homage to a king who is worthy of respect?

114-115. Just as Indra dismounts his elephant at the outer gate of the Samavasarana, so too did Jayakumar dismount his elephant at the outer gate of the royal palace and enter the assembly hall. The floor of the assembly hall was adorned with jewels. In the center stood a jewel pavilion, filled with pillars studded with brilliant gems, adorned with canopies made of various kinds of silk, and decorated with long, pendant ornaments made of strings of pearls and gems. It was enveloped in a network of precious stones. Just as the sun shines brightly on the peak of Mount Meru, so too did King Bharata shine brightly on his elevated throne in that jewel pavilion. Just as the moon is adorned by a group of celestial beings, so too was King Bharata adorned by numerous kings. His pure white chamaras, like his own skin, were waved over him.

Adipuranam .. Adorned with the radiance of various ornaments, like the bow of Indra, he appeared as if his body was made of radiance itself, and was worthy of worship with four types of merits. ||20|| Seeing the radiant king seated on a lion throne, Jayakumar, filled with devotion, bowed down to him, touching the ground with his eight limbs. ||121|| Extending his hands in respect, he was seated by the king on a nearby seat, adorned with a pleased gaze. Thus, Jayakumar, filled with joy, shone brightly amidst the assembly. ||122-123|| With a face radiant like the moon, and words that brought joy to all, the king said, "Why, Jayakumar, have you not brought your bride? We were eager to see her. Why were we not invited to this new wedding celebration? Did Akampan separate us from our kin? Is this right? Oh, I was like your father, you should have married Sulochana after placing me in front, but you have forgotten all this." ||124-125|| Thus, satisfied with the king's natural, peaceful words, Jayakumar, expressing his devotion, bowed down and looked at his feet, as if he were a sinner. Then, receiving mercy from the king, he stood up with folded hands and addressed the king of kings. ||126-128|| "O Lord, the king of Kashi, who is obedient to your commands, has always followed the tradition of a Swayamvara in all marriage ceremonies. Thus, after consulting with all the ministers who are learned in the scriptures, this celebration was begun, but fate has turned it upside down." ||129-130|| "That war, which was destined to destroy me completely, has been pacified. Therefore, this servant has come to your feet for refuge." ||131|| "O king, who conquers all directions with your chariot, many gods, vidyadharas, and kings become your servants, circling your lotus feet. Then, who am I?" ||132||

"By honoring me in a way that is not common to others, you have made me indebted. Where, even in hundreds of births, will I be free from this debt? ||133||"

"O Lord, these shoots of the lineage of the Nathas and the Chandra dynasty were created by Lord Adinath and have been nurtured, protected, and established by you for as long as the earth exists. ||134||"

Hearing these words of respect, the king, the lord of wealth, was pleased. He honored Jayakumar with clothes, ornaments, and a vehicle. He also gave suitable clothes and ornaments to Sulochana and sent her away. Jayakumar embraced the earth as if it were his beloved and bowed to King Bharat before departing. ||135-136||

It is said that the wealth of those who accumulate merit increases wealth. Thus, Jayakumar, praised for his courage by the city dwellers and the crowds of beggars, mounted an elephant and left the city. Driven by the desire to meet his beloved, he quickly reached the banks of the Ganga. ||137-138||

There, on the tip of a dry branch, facing the sun, he saw a crow cawing. Fearing for his beloved, he fainted, despite being a valiant warrior, overcome by love. The Acharya says that such happiness born of attachment is to be condemned. ||139-140||

At that moment, the priest, who understood the language of gestures and knew the omens, reassured Jayakumar with various means, saying that Sulochana was well. He explained that this omen indicated some danger from water. Thus, the priest calmed Jayakumar. ||141||

Taking the priest's words as a lifeline, Jayakumar quickly moved forward. By mistake, he drove the elephant into the ford. This is understandable, for where is the knowledge of what is to be avoided and what is to be sought for those who are infatuated with love? ||142||

The elephant was swimming in the lake, its trunk raised high, its tusks shining, its cheeks above the water, and its shape resembling a crocodile. Thus, swimming, the elephant reached the middle of the lake. At that time, the serpent-woman, who had been killed by Jayakumar's servants while copulating with another serpent and who had become the Kali Devi after death, took the form of a crocodile and seized the elephant where the Sarayu River meets the Ganga. This is right, because even a small person living in his own country becomes powerful over the great ones. Seeing the elephant sinking, many people returned and stood on the shore, but Hemaangad and others, in a panic, rushed into the lake together. Seeing them all entering the lake, Sulochana remembered the Pancha Namaskar mantra. She held the mantra-form of the Arhant Bhagwan in her heart with great devotion and renounced food and body until the end of the calamity. 142-147
Sulochana was also entering the Ganga with many friends, and at that time it seemed as if the Ganga Devi herself was entering the Ganga River with many friends. At that moment, the Ganga Devi, who resides on the Ganga-Kuta of the Ganga-Patana Kund, knowing everything from the trembling of her seat, came very quickly and, honoring the favor done to her, scolded the Kala-Kalika Devi and brought them all to the shore. 148-149
This is right, because who in this world does not come himself to protect those who do good deeds? Then, that Devi quickly built a house on the bank of the Ganga River, adorned with all kinds of wealth, by her own power. She seated Sulochana on a throne of jewels and worshipped her, saying, "It is by the Pancha Namaskar mantra given by you that I have become the presiding deity of the Ganga, and also the servant of Saudharmendra. All this has happened by your grace!" After the Ganga Devi had said this, Jayakumar also asked Sulochana, "What is this?" 150-152
Sulochana said, "Near the Vindhyachal mountain, there was a city called Vindhyapuri, where there was a Siddha named Vindhyaketu. His beloved was Priyangashri, and their daughter was... 153.

The origin of the Earth's husband, the Himalayas, is from the Earth. She has grown and the ocean is her husband. Therefore, she has become the destroyer of sins.  || 166 || She is white, revered by the righteous, and is used as a metaphor for virtuous women. All the great poets praise her and call her a deity. || 167 || If the virtuous do not praise the virtuous, then who will praise whom? Thus, the story of the Ganga and other beautiful stories are told. || 168 || After a few stages, Jayakumar reached Kurujangala, and under the pretext of describing it, he delighted Sulochana. He entered his capital, Hastinapura, which was adorned with gifts of fruits and flowers brought by the leading men of the country. It seemed as if the lake-like eyes of the city were looking forward to seeing the bridegroom, adorned with blooming blue and white lotuses.  || 169-170 || The city had a wide expanse of land, like the thighs of a beautiful woman, and a large navel, like a well and a pond. It had a high golden rampart, like a girdle, and large, decorated streets, like its beautiful arms. The palace was like its high breasts, and the shining towers were like its beautiful face. The city was smeared with saffron, sandalwood, and camphor, making its body wet. It wore garlands of various flowers, like hair, and its body was adorned with garlands of jewels tied to the toranas. It seemed as if the city was calling out with its flag-like hands, waving up and down. Its open doors were like its trusting eyes, and it seemed as if it was eagerly awaiting the festival at home. Thus, the city was adorned like another Sulochana.  || 171-175 || The king's priests, ministers, and renowned merchants stood before him, eager to give their blessings. || 176 ||

## The Thirty-Fifth Chapter

With the sound of auspicious instruments, like Indra himself, Jayakumar entered his city, Hastinapur, with his beloved Sulochana. He resided in the heart of the city, bringing great joy, along with his beloved.  

With auspicious timings, a grand festival was held, pleasing everyone, starting with the worship of the Jinas.  

With all auspicious blessings, the king, Jayakumar, sat on his throne, adorned with jewels, with Sulochana by his side.  He then, with great joy, tied the sacred thread (pattabandha) to Sulochana, making her his queen.  This is fitting, for women who accumulate good deeds deserve such love from their husbands.

Jayakumar, with great enthusiasm, served his guests, Hemaangad and his brothers, with all kinds of delicacies, dances, songs, and pleasant words. He entertained them with rides on elephants, games in the forests, lakes, and gardens, and with games like ball.  He kept them happy for many days.  Then, he gave them gifts of elephants, horses, weapons, courtesans, and jewels, and satisfied their families in every way.  Finally, he gave them four kinds of treasures - jewels, gold, silver, and money - and sent them back to their city, Banaras.

After traveling for many days, Hemaangad and his brothers reached Banaras. They met King Akampan and his wife, Supribha, and paid their respects. They stayed there, delighting their parents with stories of Jayakumar and Sulochana.

As time passed, King Akampan, weary of worldly pleasures, began to think: "Alas, I, blinded by worldly desires, have been foolish.  How unfortunate that I have been so engrossed in the fleeting pleasures of this world."

The body is made of impure elements (semen and menstrual blood), its parts are impure, it makes everything impure, it is the form of sin, and it is the abode of evil deeds. ||189|| It is a vessel with nine openings through which excrement and urine constantly flow, and in the end, this perishable body becomes a mass of worms, ashes from the pyre, and excrement. ||190|| Dwelling in such a body, this foolish being, fueled by all worldly objects, is scorched by the fires of the five senses and, like a Kulingi Yogini, falls into lower realms again. ||191|| The famous fortress of hope, in which this entire world is like an atom, is built within this very body. I want to fill this fortress of hope with a little wealth today. ||192|| Knowing the true nature of the body, which this being takes on to be born into the world and which it abandons to attain liberation, why do intelligent people still nourish it? ||193|| Alas, you have been deceived for a long time by the karma of delusion, for you still do not know the impurity of your body. If this is the case, how can you find the extremely rare abandonment of it? ||194|| In this world, those who are unhappy become happy, those who are happy become unhappy, and many remain unhappy. Similarly, the wealthy become poor, the poor become wealthy, and many remain poor forever. In this way, this being, whether happy or wealthy, does not attain the fourth state and continues to wander in the ocean of existence, bound by the three states mentioned above. ||195-196|| This man desires a woman, that woman desires another man, and the one she desires also desires another woman. This chain of desired and undesired continues... 

Page #461:
---------------------------
## The Forty-Fifth Chapter

**443**

What is desired becomes undesired, and what is undesired becomes desired. In this world, there is no fixed state of desired and undesired.  || 168 ||

A man becomes a woman, a woman becomes a eunuch, a eunuch becomes a woman, that woman becomes a man again, that man becomes a eunuch, that eunuch becomes a man again, or remains a eunuch. Thus, there is a crooked transition in this cycle. || 169 ||

Therefore, contemplating the words of the Jina, I will surely end this world. For I am now afraid of Yama, constantly wandering within the forest of Samsara. || 200 ||

These enjoyments of the enjoyers are like the hood of a serpent, and those who enjoy are called "enjoyers." Even so, none of these enjoyments are ours, this is certain. || 201 ||

What is enjoyed is called enjoyment, or the act of enjoying is called enjoyment. Both types of enjoyment exist even in hell, so what is there to love in them? || 202 ||

Just as medicine ignites the fire in the stomach, these enjoyments ignite the fire of thirst. Therefore, one should think of another way to extinguish this fire of thirst, which has been fueled by these enjoyments. || 203 ||

Thus, the wise king Akampan, who had spat out the poison of thirst, quickly summoned Hemaangad, and after worshipping the Supreme Beings, performed his coronation. Considering Lakshmi to be fickle, he bound her with a belt to make her steady, and handing her over to Hemaangad, he went to the presence of Lord Rishabhadeva, and along with many kings and queen Suprabha, took initiation, and by ascending the stages in succession, attained Kevala Jnana. || 204-206 ||

Then, Jayakumar, who had come from another birth, filled with immense love, with his eyes, which were beautiful like blooming blue lotuses, drank the nectar that flowed from the moon-like face of Sulochana, which was the source of joy. || 207 ||

Opening his eyes, which shone like blue lotuses, he drank the nectar of her melodious songs, filling his ears with it. || 208 ||

The tradition is very painful. || 167 ||

She is enacting the saying, "There is deceit in women," by making her husband believe that her fainting is due to his presence. 11
See, the artful concealment of her feelings, manifested through her feigned swoon, is a continuous, deep-seated, mature emotion, driven by love. 12
She, tainted by the transgression of the maiden's vow and the consequent fall from her lineage, has attained this feigned swoon by calling her husband "O, my beloved." 13
He describes her as virtuous, but often, even a flaw appears as a virtue to a passionate man. 14
This cunning youth, desiring to appease the angry, swooning Prabhavati, is causing us sorrow through his love for her. 15

Knowing all this, Jayakumar, with eyes that perceive the truth, looked at his beloved's smiling face and said, "My dear, tell this assembly the entire story of our past lives, and make them happy and curious." 16
Hearing this, the beloved, understanding her husband's intention, and being a skilled speaker, began to narrate the entire story of their past lives. 17-18

The king of that city was Prajapala, who ruled his people, accepting the fruits of dharma, artha, and kama, and was the best among all virtuous men. 20
This king had a famous merchant named Kubera Mitra, and he had thirty-two wives, including Marya, who were dear to his heart. 21
In the grand mansion of this merchant, surrounded by numerous buildings, lived a wise pigeon named Rativara, the best among all pigeons. 22

Adipurana
Sometimes, the merchant Kubera Mitra, who had come to the royal palace, would pick him up with affection, laughing and talking. ||23|| Sometimes, he would eat the finest rice, mixed with sugar, offered by the beautiful women. ||24|| Sometimes, he would contemplate the virtue of non-violence, explained by the merchant with reasons and examples, which benefits all beings. ||25|| Sometimes, he would go near the Muni Raja who had come to the palace, and with his wings, remove the dust from his lotus-like feet. ||26|| Sometimes, when someone would ask him out of curiosity, "What is the fate of the wicked and the virtuous?", he would point with his beak, like a silent sage, to the lower part, indicating the fate of the wicked, and then point to the upper part with his beak, indicating the fate of the virtuous. This is right, because even the animals become wise due to the greatness of the virtue of non-violence. ||23-28|| Thus, the pigeon spent his time happily there, playing various games with his beloved, Ratisheena. ||29|| Sulochana says, "That Rativara is your husband, and that Ratisheena is your beloved. Look, what does this creature, wandering in the cycle of existence, not become?" ||30|| From the wealthy wife of the merchant Kubera Datt, a son named Kubera Kant was born, who was extremely virtuous, intelligent, and seemed like another Kubera. ||31|| Kubera Kant had a best friend named Priyasena, who was with him from childhood and was like his second life. ||32|| From the time of his birth, the best wish-fulfilling cow, Kamadhenu, fulfilled all the desires of the young Kubera Kant, providing him with all the means of happiness. Every day, she produced a field of fragrant rice and another field of large, thin-skinned sugarcane, as sweet as nectar. ||33-34|| Besides this, the same Kamadhenu would constantly play a beautiful Veena in front of the young man, and due to her power, his bath would remove all diseases, sweat, and dirt. ||35||

The fragrant, deep and sweet-sounding Ganges water, falling from the sky, was removing all kinds of diseases, sweat and excreta. || 35-36 || For that Kumar, one Kalpa tree gave clothes, one gave ornaments, one gave food and one gave drink. || 37 || Thus, enjoying all other kinds of pleasures given by the Gods, the first stage of that Kumar was complete. || 38 || Seeing the completion of the first stage, the parents were worried whether he wanted one wife or many. They were doubtful and anxious with that thought. || 39 || Calling their friend Priyasena, they asked him about their son's mind and after hearing his words, they decided that he was a 'one-wife man' - he wanted only one wife, which was good because having one mind is called friendship. || 40 ||
After that, in the same city, there was a wealthy merchant named Samudradutta, who was the brother of Dhanavati, the wife of Kubera Mitra, and his sister Kubera Mitra was married to him. They had a daughter named Priyadatta and her maid was Ratikariņi. Samudradutta had thirty-two beautiful daughters including Priyadatta. One day, while worshipping the Yaksha in a garden, that wise merchant, by chance, tested those thirty-two beautiful daughters and found Priyadatta to be the most virtuous. Then, on a day with the strength of the five stars - Sun, Moon, Jupiter, Venus and Mars - he accepted Priyadatta for his son with great pomp and ceremony. || 41-44 || The virtuous Yashasvati, the daughter of King Prajapala,

The Adipurana, in the presence of the most noble Amitanant and Anantmati Aryikas, attained the highest state of restraint. When the king, Prajapala, gave all his wealth to his son, Lokapala, he also embraced restraint in the Shivakar forest, under the guidance of the sage, Shilgupta. Similarly, the queens, Kanakmala and others, also engaged in rigorous austerities. It is only natural, for when the king leads the way, even those with limited strength follow the same difficult path.

Lokapala, having attained the glory of kingship and whose prosperity was renowned everywhere, ruled the earth in accordance with the counsel of Kubera Mitra. The king had a minister named Falgumati, who was ignorant, a liar, of the same age as the king, a fool, and naturally fickle and wicked.

This minister was afraid to speak directly to Kubera Datt Seth in the presence of the king, so he wanted to remove the Seth from the king's presence. He persuaded and bribed the head guard of the king's sleeping quarters, telling him, "You should disappear like a deity at night and tell the king, 'O King, Kubera Mitra is like a father to you, and it is not possible to maintain his respect by keeping him always by your side. Therefore, do not keep him always with you, but call him only when needed.' Thus, Falgumati spoke to the head guard of the sleeping quarters, and he did everything as instructed. It is only natural, for there is nothing that money-hungry people will not do in this world.

Hearing the words of the head guard, the king was also afraid and, without thinking, called his uncle (Kubera Mitra) and said, "You should not come without being called."

The words spoken without prior thought bear poisonous fruit. The Seth, immediately filled with anxiety, went to his own house after hearing those words.

Two daughters were also present to witness this trial. When their uncle, Kubera Mitra, did not give them the food-filled vessels, they were overcome with shame and their faces hung low. At that very moment, they felt a sense of detachment.

## The Forty-Sixth Chapter

The king, riding on his elephant Lalitghata, went to the forest for a stroll. There, he saw a well and was amazed by the sight of a dry tree on its bank. A branch of this tree was close to the well, and on its tip, a crow had placed a radiant, precious, red-ruby gem, brought from somewhere. The gem's brilliance was reflected in the well. The king and his companions mistook this brilliance for a gem and were astonished. They all entered the well to retrieve it, but none of them found it. This is only right, for what fruit can be expected from those who act out of delusion, except for trouble?

They all looked for the gem in the well for a long time, but when they couldn't find it, they returned to their city, dejected. This is also right, for any effort where the intellect is not the leader, will never bear fruit.

Once, a wealthy merchant's daughter named Vasumati, filled with love, marked the king's forehead with a clear imprint of her foot, wet with saffron, in the night, to signify her good fortune. This is only right, for what will women not do when a man is under their control?

The king considered this foot-mark to be more important than a crown, and in the morning, he sat in his court and asked his ministers, "What should be done to someone who strikes the king's forehead with their foot?" Hearing this, the wise minister Falgumati said, "The king's forehead, which cannot be touched by anything other than a crown, if struck by someone's foot, should be punished with death until their breath leaves their body."

Hearing this, the king rejected the minister's suggestion and, with a faint smile, called his maternal uncle, Kubera Mitra, and asked him about the situation. Kubera Mitra, knowing the nature of the matter, said, "The one who struck your head with their foot should be worshipped with all kinds of wealth in the form of ornaments." Satisfied with his words, the king then inquired about the gem he had seen in the well during his forest stroll.

The merchant said, "The gem was not in the water, but on the bank, resting on a tree. Its reflection was only visible in the well."  ||69||
Knowing the wisdom of Kubera Mitra, his own foolishness, and the wickedness of his minister, the king was filled with remorse. ||70||
"See, I have been deceived by these scoundrels," he said, always lamenting. The wise king honored the merchant and kept him close. ||71||
From that day on, the king entrusted the merchant with the responsibility of *tantra* (protecting his kingdom) and *avaya* (managing foreign relations), and he himself, free from worries, experienced the *dharma* and *kama* purusharthas. ||72||
One day, the merchant's wife saw a gray hair on his head and said to him, "You are truly a righteous wife today." The merchant, delighted, left the king and went to the mountain called Devagiri, where he practiced austerities with other merchants like Samudradatta, under the guidance of the *varadharma guru*. Both of them, through their austerities, attained the state of *laukantika* devas at the end of the Brahma-loka. What cannot be achieved by wise people when the time and circumstances are favorable? ||73-75||
On another occasion, Priyadatta (daughter of Samudradatta and wife of Kubera Kanta) gave nine types of gifts to the *charana* sage Vipulamati, a great sage with *riddhi* (divine powers), out of devotion. She then humbly asked the sage, "Is the time for my austerities near?" ||76-77||
The wise sage, whose eyes were the embodiment of *avadhi jnana* (clairvoyance), knowing that her mind desired offspring, showed her five fingers of his right hand and the little finger of his left hand. He indicated that she would have five sons and one daughter. In due time, Priyadatta indeed gave birth to five sons and one daughter. ||78-79||
One day, Amitamati and Anantamati, daughters of the king, the protector of the world, the emperor, adorned with qualities like jewels, went to...

The 34th Chapter

The Aryika, the mistress of the Aryikas, adorned with the excellent glory of the lotus-like city of  Pundarikinī, arrived with Yasasvati, the daughter of Prajapala, and Gunavati, who had taken up the practice of austerities. ||80-81||

Along with all the inhabitants of the inner city, King Lokapala and the merchant Kubera-kanta also went to the Aryikas and, having heard of the existence of the appropriate Dharma for a long time, they engaged in giving charity and other endeavors. ||82||

One day, two Jñghācāraṇa monks arrived at the house of the merchant Kubera-kanta. Both the husband and wife welcomed them with great devotion and joy. ||83||

The pair of pigeons (Rativara and Ratiṣeṇā), who had known all the details of their previous lives just by seeing the monks, touched the feet of the monks with their wings and bowed to them, and then abandoned their mutual affection. Seeing this, the monks also became detached from the world, and both of them left the merchant's house without taking any food. ||84-85||

Priyadatta, who understood gestures, knowing all this, asked the pigeon Ratiṣeṇā one day, "What was your name in your previous birth?" ||86||

She wrote the name "Rativega" with her beak. Seeing this, the pigeon was very happy, knowing that this was his wife from his previous birth. ||87||

Similarly, Priyadatta asked the pigeon Rativara about his previous birth name. He also wrote on the ground, "I was called Sukanta in my previous birth." ||88||

Seeing this, and knowing that this was her husband, Ratiṣeṇā, desiring to be with him, also attained union with him by the grace of fate. They both started living together. ||89||

Hearing all this, all the people sitting in the assembly were very happy, and they all sat with great eagerness, wanting to hear the rest of the story. ||90||

"If you know anything else that we have seen or heard, please tell us," said Jayakumar.  Sulocanā, watering that auspicious assembly with the nectar of her words, said, "Yes, I know it well. Listen." ||91||

Then, leaving the Muni's request for alms, the reason for his departure is explained. The king, unable to understand the reason for his departure, asked Amitmati. Amitmati, having heard the story, explained. ||93||
In this region, near the Vijayardha mountain, there is a large forest called Dhanayakamal. Near this forest is a great city called Shobhanagar. ||94||
The king of this city was Prajapal, and his wife was Devashri, who brought happiness like another Lakshmi. ||95||
Shaktisheṇa was his minister, and his wife was Atvīśrī, who brought him joy. Their son was Satydeva. ||96||
All of them, being near-death, took refuge in my feet and heard the Dharma. The king was also with them, and all of them, having heard the Dharma, gave up alcohol and meat. They also took the vow to fast on the days of the festival. Shaktisheṇa, being devoted, also took the vow of a householder and decided to eat after the Muni's meal time. ||97-98||
Shaktisheṇa's wife, Atvīśrī, took the vow to abstain from food on the first day of the bright fortnight and the eighth day of the dark fortnight for five years. She also took the vow of the Anupravṛddha Kalyāṇa fast. Satydeva also took the vow to praise the saints. ||99-100||
Thus, they all became adorned with the ornaments of vows without having true faith. One day, Shaktisheṇa, with his army, went to Mṛṇālavati, the city of his wife's parents, to bring Atvīśrī back. While returning, he stopped near the Serpent Lake in the Dhanayakamal forest. At that time, another incident occurred, which is narrated as follows.

The sixty-fourth chapter: Sukethu, the son of the Vaishya Rativarma, was a merchant. His son, Bhavadeva, was infamous for his lack of virtue and wealth. ||10|| In the same city, there lived a merchant named Shridatta, whose beloved wife, Vimala, gave birth to a daughter named Rativega. ||105|| In the same city, a son named Sukanta was born to the merchant Ashokdeva and his beloved wife, Jinadatta. Bhavadeva, known for his wickedness, was also called Durmukha. ||106|| This Bhavadeva, desiring to marry Rativega, went away to earn wealth. When he did not return by the time of the marriage, his parents gave their daughter to the very virtuous Sukanta. When Durmukha returned from a foreign land and heard of Rativega's marriage, he was enraged. Fearing him, the bride and groom fled to the shelter of Shaktisheṇa. ||107-109|| Durmukha, determined to pursue them, followed the bride and groom. However, fearing Shaktisheṇa, he suppressed his anger and returned. ||110|| Shaktisheṇa offered food to two celestial beings who had come to his shelter, considering it as a gift for his future life. ||111|| At the same lake, a wealthy merchant named Merukadatta, the leader of the merchant guild, arrived with many people. His wife was named Dharini. The merchant had four ministers: Bhutārtha, Shakuni, Brihaspati, and Dhanvantari. All four were learned in their respective scriptures. ||112-113|| One day, the merchant, surrounded by his ministers, saw a man with a deformed limb and asked him, "Why are you like this?" ||114||

Shakuni said, "Due to a bad omen, a bad planet, and sin, he was born with a disability." Brihaspati said, "He was born with a disability due to the influence of evil planets at the time of his birth." Dhanvantari said, "He was born with a disability due to the three doshas (vata, pitta, and kapha) at the time of his birth." 
Hearing this, the minister named Bhootarth said, "Let all of this be. The main reason for his disability is the karma he accumulated in his previous life through violence and other actions." 
At that time, Shaktipana, the commander-in-chief, who had accepted him as his son, came searching for him. Seeing his disabled son, he was very distressed and said, "O assembly, listen! One day, rice was being cooked at home, and due to the overflow of water, some rice fell out of the pot. The pigeons and other birds started eating the fallen rice. But he stood there silently, not chasing them away. Then his mother's younger sister scolded him in anger. Unable to bear the scolding, he came here. He is so intolerant that he cannot even bear the words 'There is a hole in your face below your nose.' Thus, his father described his inability to act to the entire assembly. 
Since Satyake did not want to return with his father, he was distressed and made a vow, "Even in the next life, I will be worthy of your love." Making this vow, he became a Dravyalingi muni and died out of love for Satyake, becoming a Lokapala. 
One day, on the first day of the bright fortnight, Shaktipana, along with his wife Atvishri, who was observing a fast, gave food to the munis with devotion and obtained five wonders. Seeing this, Seth Merukadatta and his wife Dharini made a vow, "May these two be our children in the next life."

The forty-fifth chapter: Having performed austerities, they ended their time and attained the state of Lokapala. The bride and groom also obtained great merit by approving of the donation. ||126|| Hearing this, the queen Vasumati, the wife of the king Lokapala, remembered her past life and fainted. After regaining consciousness, she said to Amitmati Aryika, "I was Devashri, the queen of king Prajapala of Shobhanagar in my previous life. By your grace, I obtained this Lakshmi. Where is my husband, king Prajapala, from that life? Please tell me." ||127-128|| When Vasumati's question ended, Amitmati Aryika said, "This Lokapala is the king Prajapala from your previous life." As soon as she said this, Priyadatta also remembered her past life. She bowed to Aryika and said, "I am Atvishri, the wife of Shaktisheena. Please tell me where my husband Shaktisheena is today?" When asked this, Amitmati said, "This is your husband, Kuberakant, who was Shaktisheena in that life. And this Kuberadayit is your son, who was Satydev in that life. The four ministers of Seth Merukadatta, who were Bhutart, etc., have attained the state of Devas and are serving your husband with great affection from birth - they are serving as Kamdhenu and Kalpvriksh." ||129-132|| It is right that Satyaka, the father of Kuberadayit in his previous life, is a Deva and protects him, because due to the influence of merit, beings in other states also become affectionate. ||133|| Bhavadev had burnt the aforementioned bride and groom (Rativega and Sukant) in the past, so they both died and became these pigeons. Seth Merukadatta and his wife, who were Dhanavati in that life, are the parents of your husband, Kuberakant. ||134||

The Adipurana, as it is called, was narrated by Amitamati near the Khaga mountain. Two monks, Vasanta and Charana, lived near the Malaya mountain.  [135]
In the past, they had come to your place seeking alms, residing in the forest near the Shakti forest. They had predicted that you would have five sons and one daughter, and then left. [136]
These two pigeons, who were the cause of the rain of jewels and other miracles, were seen by the monks. Moved by compassion, they left without taking alms. [137]
These two monks were the gurus of your father and husband. I have narrated all this in order, as I heard it from their teachings. [138]
Those who were listening to Amitamati's story were engrossed in understanding the true nature of the world. [139]
After some time, Priyadatta asked Yasasvati and Gunavati, "Why did you take this initiation? I am curious to know." They then explained the reason for their initiation. [140-141]
Later, Dhanavati, the wife of Kubera Mitra, took initiation from Amitamati, the head of the Sangha. Kuberaseana, the mother of these two Aryikas, also took initiation near her daughter. [142]
One day, the two pigeons, driven by Yama, went to another village to eat rice. There was a cat, a creature of Bhavadeva, who, due to the hatred he had from a previous life, was filled with evil upon seeing the pigeons and killed them. [143-144]
In the southern part of the Vijayachala mountain in the Pushkalavati country, there is a country called Gandhara. In that country, there is a city called Usiravati... [145]

The sixtieth chapter tells the story of Aditya-Gati and his queen, Shashi-Prabha. They had a son named Hiranya-Varma, born from the reincarnation of the pigeon, Rati-Var.  ||146||

In the northern range of the Vijay mountain, there was a country called Gauri. In its famous city of Bhog-pur, the king of the Vidyadharas, Vayu-rath, ruled. His queen was named Swayam-Prabha. Their daughter, Prabhavati, was born from the reincarnation of the pigeon, Rati-shana. This is true because even a small part of Jain Dharma can liberate beings. ||147-148||

The parents of Sukant and Rati-vega in their previous birth are the same as their parents in this birth. This is not surprising because the world is full of wonders.  ||149||

When Jay-kumar, sitting with Sulochana, said, "Oh, my Prabhavati," what more needs to be said about her beauty and other qualities? ||150||

Seeing Prabhavati, adorned with youth, the king of the Vidyadharas, Vayu-rath, asked his ministers, "To whom should we give this daughter?" ||151||

The ministers, after deliberation, said, "Shashi-Prabha is your sister, and Aditya-Gati is the brother of your queen. Both of them, along with many other Vidyadhara kings, are eagerly seeking your daughter's hand in marriage. Therefore, it would be best to hold a Swayamvara. This way, there will be no conflict." The king agreed with his ministers. ||152-153||

After hearing about the Swayamvara, all the princes arrived. But Prabhavati did not accept any of them by placing a garland around their necks. ||154||

Seeing this, her parents asked her friend, Priya-karini, the reason. The friend told them, "She had said earlier, 'Whoever wins me in a battle of speed, I will place a garland around his neck.'" Hearing this, the king, on that day, dismissed everyone with appropriate words. ||155-156|| 

Page #478:
---------------------------
## The Adipurana

On that day, the king of the Kechara (celestial beings) announced the swayamvara (self-choice of a husband) and declared that a garland would be released from the entrance of the Siddhakoota Chaitya (temple).  He said that whoever among the Kechara could catch the garland after it was released, after circumambulating Mount Meru thrice, before it touched the ground, would be the husband of Prabhavati.  Hearing this, many Kechara tried, but none could succeed in catching the garland in the manner described.  Thus, they were defeated by Prabhavati and left in shame.  It is right, for even death cannot equal the humiliation of the proud.  (157-159)

Then, Hiranyavarma, skilled in the art of war, arrived.  Defeated by him, Prabhavati placed the garland around his neck. (160)

Their love from a previous birth, enriched by happiness and prosperity, continued to grow.  One day, seeing a pair of pigeons, Prabhavati remembered their past connection.  She became detached and filled with sorrow, sitting alone, lost in thought. (161-162)

Meanwhile, Hiranyavarma also remembered his past life.  He wrote down the details of their previous birth on a piece of cloth and gave it to Prabhavati's friend, Priyakarini.  Seeing the cloth in Priyakarini's hand, Prabhavati asked, "Where did you get this cloth?"  Her friend replied, "This cloth was written by your husband and given to me by his servant, Sukanta."  Hearing this, Prabhavati also wrote down the details of her past life on a piece of cloth and gave it to her friend. (163-165)

Seeing the cloth, Hiranyavarma's love for Prabhavati grew even stronger.  Prabhavati's love for him also doubled.  (166)

All their relatives gathered and performed their wedding ceremony, as if they were celebrating their second auspicious occasion. (167)

On the tenth day after their wedding, they were performing the Abhishek Puja (consecration ceremony) at the Siddhakoota Chaitya.  At that time, Hiranyavarma... (168)

The Forty-Sixth Chapter

461.  Asked by Prabhavati, he spoke of his own past life. The Muni, with a mind full of grace, spoke to them thus:

169.  In your third birth, you were born in the merchant caste in Mrinālavati city, as Rativega and Sukānta.

170.  Having attained the bond of husband and wife, you both fled in fear of the enemy and took refuge with Shaktisheṇa. There, you both made a meritorious bond by approving of the food offering that Shaktisheṇa had given to the Muni.

171.  Then, in the form of a pigeon and dove, you both gained Dharma and became Vidyadhara and Vidyadhari here.

172.  Your parents in your previous birth as Vaishyas are also your parents in this birth.

173.  In your third birth, your parents and I, together, took the Proshdha vow in the presence of Ratisheṇa, our Guru, and we observed it for a long time.

174.  We, the lords of the birds, performed worship with various offerings in the temple of the Jina with devotion. As a result, we have become Vidyadharas here.

175.  In my previous birth, I was the father of Bhavadeva, named Rativārma. Now, I have become a Vidyadhara named Shridharma. I have attained purity by observing restraint with a pure heart and have obtained the Charana power and the third stage of knowledge.

176.  Hearing the Muni's words, Hiranyavarma and Prabhavati were filled with joy.

177.  Thus, time passed pleasantly for all of them. One day, Prabhavati's father, Vayuratha Vidyadhara, saw the fleeting clouds and thought, "This entire world is perishable, yet people consider it permanent. Why is this dense darkness of ignorance pervading everywhere?"

178.  Realizing the true nature of things, he renounced his kingdom and wished to attain a state of detachment for the sake of his son, Manorantha.

179.  At that time, all of Vayuratha's relatives, with great joy, said, "Prabhavati's daughter, Ratiprabha, should be given to you."

Adipurana, the daughter of Manोरथ, चित्ररथा, for him. So they said, and he, having given permission, made the farewell of his relatives. ||18|| *Hiranyavarma's coronation as king of all birds. Having performed it with many, he reached the Muni-pungava. ||2|| Having become established in self-control, he, along with Vayuratha, himself. He performed the twelve types of austerities as prescribed. ||183|| Having said this, I, Rativega, am Ratisheṇa, I am also Prabhavati. Sulochana said this to the assembly. ||184|| Jay, the ever-doer, also said, I am their husband in succession. He spoke words that astonished the world. ||185|| Again, Jay said to his beloved, something else remains. Tell me that also, my dear. ||186|| Thus, by the questions of her husband, like the moon's rays, the assembly. The form of Kumudvati, bringing forth its blossoming. ||187|| She said, thus, the story, the result of her own merit.

The best of the wise, having obtained knowledge from the acquisition of time. ||190|| 'Bhangara', the union of all beings is desired. What is the name of happiness, which is born of a small resolve? ||191|| Life is like the wind, the body is a receptacle of disease, it is to be abandoned. The kingdom is enjoyed by the fickle, full of faults. ||192|| This body is not far away, it is full of evil, it is the abode of evil. By identifying oneself with this, one is dear to the impure. ||193||
Premse, going near the sun's path, prayed, 'May this Ratiprabha, the daughter of Prabhavati, be given to my son, Chitraratha, the son of Manोरथ.' The sun's path also accepted and sent off the relatives who had come. ||180-181|| King Aditya-Gati, with all the Vidyadharas, crowned Hiranyavarma over the kingdom, and with many people, reached the abode of some Muni-raja, and along with Vayuratha, he himself also took up self-control and performed the twelve types of austerities as prescribed in the scriptures. ||182-183|| Having said all this, Sulochana said to all the members of the assembly that she is also Rativega, she is also Ratisheṇa (dove), and she is also Prabhavati. ||184|| Hearing this, Jayakumar also spoke words that astonished everyone, saying that he was the husband of those three beings, Rativega, etc., in succession. ||185|| Jayakumar then said to his beloved Sulochana, 'My dear, something else remains, tell me that also well.' ||186|| Just as the moon's form causes the Kumudini to blossom, so also Sulochana, by the brilliance of her teeth, caused the assembly to blossom and rejoice, and by the fruit of her merit, she began to tell the news in this way, that Hiranyavarma, born of the kingdom, began to enjoy the happiness as he desired. One day, while wandering with his beloved, Hirany

463. There is no fear in dwelling in the body, but there is great fear in leaving it. For the embodied soul, there is indeed a reversal of the path of liberation. || 164 ||

This being is formless in its own nature, but becomes formed through association with the body. Being formless is the attainment of liberation, therefore, just as it has been formed, so too must the body be abandoned. || 195 ||

All attachment is bondage, enjoyment is disease, the body is an enemy, a long lifespan is a source of suffering, and wealth is fuel for the fire of craving. || 196 ||

First, there is birth, then old age and disease, and finally, in the end, there is death, the wicked one. Thus, the embodied soul wanders like a wheel in the ocean of existence. || 197 ||

Enjoyments are like the hoods of a serpent for those who enjoy them, therefore, they are not enjoyable. Thus, for those who contemplate these enjoyments, they become increasingly fearful. || 198 ||

These objects of enjoyment are like poison, and they flare up like a fire fueled by stimulating medicines. || 199 ||

There is no satisfaction in them, and this is not the only fault, but they also nourish craving and support the vine of worldly existence. || 200 ||

The fire of desire, born from the body of a woman, fueled by the oil of affection, does not cease until it has consumed the desiring man. || 201 ||

At the end of enjoyment, all beings experience dispassion. For the wise, the effort to maintain this dispassion is the essence of all actions. || 202 ||

Even though this being has experienced suffering many times through enjoyment, it still desires them. Just as a child clings to the foot of its mother who beats it, so too does this being cling to enjoyment. || 203 ||

1. Dwelling in the body.
2. Leaving it.
3. From dwelling in the body.
4. Reversal.
5. Embodied soul.
6. By any means.
7. Attachment to children, friends, etc.
8. In the ocean of existence.
9. Of a serpent.
10. Like the body. Or like the hood. "Enjoyment is like the hood of a serpent, in the case of women, etc., and in the case of wealth."
11. Enjoyments are not enjoyable.
12. Burn fiercely.
13. By the desire to enjoy.
14. By stimulating causes.

20. Of dispassion.
21. The essence of practice.

I consider the impermanence of possessions, lifespan, time, and wealth to be a kind of virtue, because if these were all permanent, how could liberation be attained? And without liberation, how could there be happiness? || 204 ||  Those who are like enemies, first generating faith and then stealing life and wealth, bring misfortune to everyone. || 205 || The happiness derived from these objects is merely the greatness of suffering, because the bitterness of a bitter gourd is merely the effect of hunger. || 206 || This being, satisfied with imagined pleasures, is turned away from the true happiness born of the Self, and is like a monkey content with the warmth of a firefly. || 207 || This being is constantly experiencing decay, but without the absence of bondage, it cannot be the cause of liberation. The absence of bondage can be achieved by destroying the causes of bondage, therefore I strive to destroy the causes of bondage. || 208 || In this ocean of existence, those who are grasped by the demons of attachment, how can they attain liberation? How can they live? Where can they find happiness? And where can they find wisdom? || 209 || Even knowing the impermanence of things, wise people, struck down by the arrows of Lakshmi's glance, doubt, "Is this being destined for liberation or not?" || 210 || This tree of the body, surrounded by the vines of women, will grow old in the forest of existence and be consumed by the fire of time. || 211 || If I have experienced such happiness from a single particle of karma, contaminated by the poison of its cause, then what happiness will I experience by immersing myself in the ocean of Dharma-amrita? || 212 ||

The causes of bondage are: wrong belief, non-restraint, carelessness, passions, and karma.

"Ignorance, hatred, and attachment are the essence of the world, and liberation is the opposite of them. It is the state of right knowledge and equanimity. If the wise see this, then what is the delay in attaining liberation?"

"Just as a jewel dropped from the hand into the middle of the ocean cannot be retrieved by a man rushing along, so too, even if the materials of time, place, and lineage are available, how can one attain tapasya without actually performing it?"

"O Atman, you should accept your own Atman as the Supreme Atman within your own Atman, by your own Atman. Abandoning evil-mindedness within yourself, you should walk the path of Dharma."

Reflecting thus, the king, a knower of the Supreme Truth, went to his city and, after performing the coronation ceremony, handed over the kingdom to his son, Suvarnavarma. Then, descending from the Vijayachala mountain to the earth, he reached the city of Shripur, the abode of Lakshmi, and received Jaineshwari Diksha from the venerable Shri Pal Guru.

Free from the clutches of attachment, he, after receiving Diksha, became pure like the sun, and the king Hiranyavarma was shining brightly with the rays of tapasya.

Pravabhati, the mother of Hiranyavarma, also received Diksha along with Shashi Prabha, the mother of Hiranyavarma, from the virtuous Aryika. This is appropriate, for how can the moonlight exist separately from the moon?

The Muni Raja Hiranyavarma appeared just like the sun. Just as the sun is perfect, so too, he was a man of perfect character. Just as the sun shines brightly with the heat of tapasya, so too, he was shining brightly with the tapasya of fasting and other austerities. Just as the sun is the ornament of the sky and the directions, so too, he was the ornament of the naked ascetics, who wear the sky as their garment. Just as the sun is alone and without any support, so too, he was free from attachments. Just as the sun travels through the sky, so too, he traveled through the sky due to his Charan Riddhi. Just as the sun moves alone, so too, he was alone and solitary. Just as everyone worships the sun, so too, everyone worships the Muni Raja.

Adipurana, like the moon with its rays, was there with Prabhavati. The association of the virtuous is by chance. ||222|| Seeing the virtuous Aryika, Priyadatta bowed and asked, "Where is the Amitamati, the head of the Sangha?" Prabhavati replied, "She has gone to heaven." ||223|| Hearing this, Prabhavati was filled with sorrow and said, "She was like our eyes." Priyadatta asked, "How did you become so attached to her?" Prabhavati replied, "Do you not remember the pair of pigeons in your house? I was the pigeon named Ratishena." Hearing this, Priyadatta was astonished and said, "Where is that Ratishena now?" Prabhavati replied, "He is also a Vidhyadhara king, Hiranyavarma, and he is here in this city of Pundarikinya, destroying the enemies of karma." ||224-225|| Priyadatta went and bowed to the great Muni Hiranyavarma. Then, at Prabhavati's request, she told the story of her husband. ||226-227|| A Vidhyadhara named Ratishena came here from Gandhara city on Mount Vijaya with his wife Gandhari. ||228|| Gandhari pretended to be bitten by a snake and stayed there. Kubera-kanta and the Vidhyadhara used many medicines, but Gandhari, with her magical powers, said, "I am not yet cured."

The sixty-fourth chapter. When Ratiṣeṇa heard the words, "I am not peaceful," he was filled with sorrow. He went to the forest to bring a powerful medicine. ||230|| When he left, Gāndhārī, assuming the role of a courtesan, displayed amorous gestures. Seeing this, the merchant Kubera-kānta, who knew the ways of the world and was steadfast in his vows, said, "Oh, I am impotent, don't you know?" Thus, he made her indifferent to him. This is indeed the fruit of wisdom. ||231-232|| At that time, her husband returned. Gāndhārī said, "I have recovered from the previous medicine." Saying this, she went to the city with her husband. ||233|| Kubera-dayita, Kubera-mitra, Kubera-datta, Kubera-deva, and Kubera-priya, these five were my sons. All five were learned in all scriptures, skilled in arts and crafts, and adorned with youthful vigor. ||234|| One day, when Kubera-śrī was in my womb, I went to the forest with my aforementioned sons in a palanquin for a pleasure trip. At that time, Gāndhārī saw me and, taking me aside, asked, "Is it true that your husband is not a man?" I replied, "It is absolutely true, for he is not a man for any woman other than me." Hearing this, she became indifferent and, along with her husband, embraced restraint. ||235-238|| One day, Gāndhārī came here again. I bowed to her and, with affectionate words, asked, "Why have you taken this initiation?" She replied, "The reason for my austerity is your husband." The merchant, secretly hearing this, came forward and stood there. ||239|| He asked, "Where is my friend who conquered me?" Gāndhārī said, "He has also come here to practice austerity for my sake." ||240-241|| Hearing this, the merchant and the king both went to the sage. They bowed to him and, when the time was right, the king asked him about dharma. ||242||

The king, Lokapala, gave his kingdom to his son, Gunapala, and he himself took the vow of non-violence near the Vidyaadhara Muni, Ratishena. ||243|| The Seth, desiring liberation, appointed his fifth son, Kubera Priya, to his position and took the vow of non-violence along with his other sons. ||244|| Having heard the story of her husband, Priyadatta, with the knowledge that arose within her, renounced her household life and gave her daughter, Kubera-shri, to King Gunapala. She herself, following the teachings of Prabhavati, took the vow of non-violence. ||245-246|| Once, Muni Hiranyavarma, having taken a vow of seven days, performed the Pratimā Yoga in the cremation ground. All the people of the city went to pay their respects to him. After paying their respects and narrating the stories of his past lives, they returned to the city. A Vidyaachora, having heard the story of Muni from Priyadatta's maid, felt anger towards him. Due to this anger, he experienced the Vibhangavadhi and through it, he came to know all the details of the Muni's past lives. Although the Muni was performing the Pratimā Yoga in a separate place and Prabhavati was also in a separate place, this wicked man, with the desire to accumulate sin, brought them together and placed them on the same pyre and burned them. They both, due to their pure karmas, endured this affliction and were reborn in heaven. What is not possible through forgiveness? When Suvarna Varma came to know about this, he vowed to punish the Vidyaachora. Knowing this vow through their Avadhi knowledge, Hiranyavarma and Prabhavati, who were residing in heaven, took the form of Sannyasins and went to their son. They comforted him with stories of Dharma and instilled faith in him. ||247-254||

The Forty-Sixth Chapter

466. Having assumed a divine form, he narrated his own story, and having given them precious ornaments, he went to his own place. ||255||

Once, in the country of Vatsa, near the city of Susima, the Muni Shivagosha, who had destroyed the karma of Ghatiya, attained Kevala Jnana. ||256||

In that festival, Shachi and Menaka, the celestial nymphs, came with Indra and bowed down to the Jinesvara. They sat near Indra. Indra asked the Lord, "Why have these two become celestial nymphs?" Then the Tirthankara said, "In their previous birth, they were the daughters of a gardener. The first one was named Pushpapalita and the second one was Pushpavati. Both of them had taken the Shravaka Vrata seven days ago. One day, while they were picking flowers in the forest, they died due to a serpent-like fire and became celestial nymphs." ||257-258||

Hiranyavarma and Prabhavati, who had become celestial beings, also heard about their previous birth in the Samavasarana. Then, both of them left the assembly ground and, according to their wish, went to the places where they had experienced happiness in their previous birth. They reached the forest near the serpent lake. ||260-261||

In that forest, a Muni named Bhima had also come with his group. Seeing him, both of them bowed down to him with humility and asked him about Dharma. ||262||

Hearing their words, the Muni said, "I am newly initiated. Teaching Dharma is the work of those Munis who know the meaning of all the scriptures. Therefore, although I am not capable of teaching Dharma, I will say something according to my ability at your request. You should listen carefully." ||263-264||

Saying this, he explained the Samyak Darshan, Satpatra Dana, and other things related to Shravakas, and also the Dharma related to Yama and other Munis. He explained the four Gatis, their causes and results, the means of attaining heaven and liberation, and the essence of Jiva and other substances. ||265-266||

Those celestial beings, having listened to the Dharmakatha, etc., developed faith in the truth, their anger subsided, and finally, they revealed their divine form and narrated their whole story. Then, giving them precious ornaments, both of them went to their own places. ||247-255|| 

Page #488:
---------------------------
470
Hearing this Adipurana, the two divine beings asked the muni, "Why did you take the vow of renunciation?" The muni began to speak. 

"In the city of  Pundarikinī, in the Videha region, in the land of Pushkalavati, I was born into a very poor family, due to my past sins. My name is Bhima. 

"One day, after some time had passed, I met a muni and heard the Dharma from him. I then adopted the eight fundamental qualities of a householder. 

"When my father learned of this, he said, 'What is the use of these difficult vows for us, whose bodies are covered in the mud of poverty? They do not bear fruit in this world. Let us give these vows to that muni who desires the heavenly realm. We want the fruits of this world, so that we can make a living.'

"My father said to me, 'Show me the place of the guru who received the vows.' I took him with me. On the way, I saw a man named Vajraketu being punished. I asked my father the reason, and he said, 'This man was drying his grain in the sun, and a temple rooster was eating it. He beat the rooster so badly that it died. That is why people are punishing him.'

"Further on, I saw the tongue of Dhandeva, who had stolen the treasure entrusted by the Jinadeva, being pulled out due to his greed. A little further on, I saw Ratipingala being impaled by the kotwal for stealing a necklace of precious gems from a wealthy man's house and giving it to a prostitute. In another place, I saw a kotwal, whose knowledge had been destroyed by lust, being dismembered by the royal officials because he had gone to the house of his mother's younger sister's daughter at night. In another place, I saw a farmer named Lola, who had killed his elder son with sticks out of greed for his field, being exiled from the country. 

"All this was a true representation of the consequences of actions."

The Forty-Sixth Chapter

471.  In the scorching sun, Sagaradatta was unable to pay his debt to the gambler, so he was kept in the midst of foul-smelling smoke for a long time.  (27)

The king of Anga, Anand, had declared that no one should be harmed, but his son, Angaka, killed the king's horse and ate it.  For this, his hand was cut off and he was fed excrement.  (28)

In another place, a woman who drank alcohol killed a child for its ornaments to buy alcohol.  She was caught by a royal official and punished.  (281)

Seeing these sinful acts, born of violence and other vices, I realized that the fruits of sin are bad in this world and the next.  (283)

Fearing the consequences of the world, I did not consider it right to abandon my vows.  I thought, "Men who are corrupted by violence, deceit, theft, adultery, etc., suffer various punishments of death and imprisonment in this life, but they also suffer in the next life.  Our poverty is also due to our past sins.  Therefore, virtuous men should accumulate as much merit as possible."  (284-285)

Thinking this, I left my father and took initiation, desiring liberation.  (286)

By the grace of my Guru, I quickly became proficient in all the scriptures and my mind became pure.  On another day, I heard about my past lives, full of vices, from the omniscient Lord.  I will tell you about them, as it will be a great wonder for you.  (287-288)

In the country of Pushkalavati, King Vasupala lovingly protected the city of Pandarikini.  (289)

One day, the Kotwal caught a thief named Vidyutvega.  He took the money from the thief's hand and said, "Give me the rest of the money."  When the thief refused, the guards punished him.  (290)

Seeing the Talavara at night, he said, "I am outside today." Thus, the minister's son came at the time of the offering. || 304 || Seeing him, Prithudhi, the king's brother-in-law, by name, placed the Talavara in a casket, keeping him safe. || 305 || "You had given my ornaments to Satyavati, bring them now for your sister," said the king's brother-in-law. || 306 || He, having previously promised this, due to his vow-taking, became envious and hostile on the second day. || 307 || Considering him a witness, he went to the king, with the casket, and requested his wealth, offering him a garland of lotuses. || 308 || "I have not taken her wealth," said the king's brother-in-law, falsely. When the king asked Satyavati, she brought all the wealth and placed it before the king. || 309 || Seeing this, the king became very angry at his brother-in-law and ordered his soldiers, "This wicked man should be killed immediately." This is right, for it is proper for those who follow the path of justice. || 310 || One day, while listening to the Dharma Shastra from the Muni, the king's chief elephant remembered his previous birth and became very peaceful. He also stopped taking the offering of meat. Seeing this, the Seth, knowing the ways of the world, understood the elephant's intentions and, with wisdom, devised a plan. || 311-312 || He offered the elephant a mixture of ghee, jaggery, milk, and rice. The elephant also accepted this pure food. || 313 || At that time, the king, pleased, said, "Ask for whatever you desire." The Seth said, "Good, I will keep this boon for now, I will take it later." Saying this, the Seth remained happy. || 314 || Seeing him, the Seth was very sad. At that time, the minister's son was being taken to be killed. The Seth, remembering his previous boon, asked the king for it and saved the wicked minister's son from death. || 315 || 

1. With the Talavara. 2. "I am outside today," he said. 3. He agreed, saying, "I will bring it." 4. The details of the incident should be understood here. 5. Taken. 6. He used to eat. 7. The minister's son. 8. Prithudhi.

This rejection was indeed done by the Seth, and it is right, because even doing a favor to a sinner is like giving milk to a snake. ||316|| On another day, the king's brother-in-law was roaming in the forest at his own will. There he found a ring from a Khechara, which could make him take any form he desired. ||317|| He put that ring on the finger of his younger brother Vasu, and making him take the form of the Seth, sent him to Satyavati's house. And Prithudhi, who had adopted the nature of a sinner, went and sat near the king himself. Seeing Vasu, who had taken the form of the Seth, the king said, "Why has this Seth come here at this untimely hour?" At that time, Prithudhi said, "This sinner, who does not know himself, has come to Satyavati, being burnt by the fire of lust." Without examining him, the king, on hearing his words, ordered, "Kill the Seth." The Seth was at his own house on that day, meditating on the form of the object, holding the image of the deity. ||318-322|| Prithudhi bound him tightly there, and taking him towards the cremation ground, he proclaimed to the people the crime that he had not committed. ||323|| Going there, he handed him over to the Chandala to kill him. The Chandala, thinking that this was the king's order, struck him firmly with his sword. ||324|| But what a wonder! The blow of the sword on the chest of that Seth, who was a devotee of the Arhant, the Supreme Deity, and who was a follower of good conduct, turned into a garland of jewels. ||325|| Such a great calamity arose in the city due to the punishment given to the Seth without examination, that it could cause the destruction of all. It is right, because what does not happen by killing a virtuous man? ||326|| Seeing this calamity, the king and all the people of the city were frightened and ran towards the cremation ground to seek refuge in that Seth. ||327|| When they all reached his refuge, then only that calamity was removed. The gods residing in heaven were amazed, and praising the power of good conduct, they worshipped the noble merchant. ||328||

You should forgive us for our actions without proper consideration. Thus, the king and others, being afraid, said to the Seth. ||326|| This has happened due to the ripening of our past evil deeds. You should not be sad about this, it is certain. ||330|| The best among the forgiving ones, the Seth, dispelled their dejection. Honored by all, he entered the city with great splendor. ||331|| Thus, in due course, the king, full of glory, gave the daughter of this Seth, named Varisheṇa, to his son Vasupala. ||332|| On another day, the king asked the Seth in the assembly, "Are these four Purusharthas (Dharma, Artha, Kama, Moksha) mutually opposed or not?" ||333|| The Seth, knowing the essence of Dharma, etc., said, "For those with right vision, these four Purusharthas are mutually beneficial, but not for those with wrong vision." ||334|| The king was pleased by these words of the Seth and said, "Ask for whatever you desire, I will give it." Then the Seth said, "I desire the destruction of birth and death." ||335|| The king replied, "These two are not within my power." Then the great merchant Seth said, "Leave me, I will achieve them myself." ||336|| Hearing this, the king said, "I will leave home with you, but my sons are still young, they are small." Thus, the king was thinking. ||337|| Suddenly, he saw the young ones of the lizard, who had just emerged from the broken egg, and were eager to catch flies due to hunger. Seeing them, the king thought, "All living beings know their means of livelihood without anyone's instruction, so what is the use of my worrying about my young sons?" Thinking thus, King Gunapala gave the kingdom to Vasupala according to the rules, and made Shri Pala the Yuvaraja with the crown. Then,

Adipurana
The great king Gugapala, beloved of Kubera, embraced the path of asceticism, along with many warriors. He sought refuge in the great sage. ||341||
Seeing the fruits of the supreme vow of non-violence, the Chandala also embraced the same vow. Therefore, he said, "You were not killed." The thief also praised him. ||342||
Having said this, he said to the sage, "Previously, in the city of Mrinnalavati, you were a Vaishya named Bhavadeva. There, you harbored enmity towards Rativega and Sukanta and killed them. After death, they became a pair of pigeons. There too, you became a cat and killed them. They were reborn as Vidyadharas. You, becoming a lightning thief, killed them by affliction. Due to that sin, you went to hell. ||343-344||
Having suffered the torments of hell, you emerged from there and became this Bhima. Thus, the wise Bhima, in the presence of the gods and goddesses, clearly revealed his past deeds. ||345-346||
"We are the ones whom you killed three times," they said, their minds, speech, and bodies purified, and filled with the spirit of righteous Dharma. The two divine beings bowed to Bhima and departed. ||347||
Hearing this, Sulochana, the younger sister of Hemaangada, said, "Once, in the beautiful garden of Shivanakara in the city of Pundarikinya, the great sage Bhima, who had attained perfect knowledge by destroying the karma of killing, was residing. All people were worshipping him. At that time, four goddesses came and bowed to him. They listened to the nature of Dharma and asked, 'O Lord of the three worlds, our husband has died due to our sins. Tell us, who will be our husband now?' ||348-349||
Thus, the king, who was hidden, became known in that city. He was called Suradeva, and the earth became his wealth. ||350||
The Seth, beloved of Kubera, along with many other kings, went to the sage and embraced the path of asceticism. ||338-341||
The Chandala said, "Seeing the fruits of the Seth's vow of non-violence, I also embraced the vow of non-violence. That is why I did not kill you." Hearing this, the lightning thief also praised him greatly. ||342||
Having said this, Bhima, sitting before the gods and goddesses, said, "The omniscient Lord has told me clearly, 'You were a Vaishya named Bhavadeva in the city of Mrinnalavati. There, you harbored enmity towards Rativega and Sukanta and killed them. After death, they became a pair of pigeons. There too, you became a cat and killed them. They were reborn as Vidyadharas. You, becoming a lightning thief, killed them by affliction. Due to that sin, you went to hell.' And after suffering the torments of hell, you emerged from there and became this Bhima." Thus, the wise Bhima, sitting before the gods and goddesses, revealed his entire past deeds. ||343-346||
"We are the ones whom you killed three times," they said, their minds, speech, and bodies purified, and filled with the spirit of righteous Dharma. The two divine beings bowed to Bhima and departed. ||347||
Hearing this, Sulochana, the younger sister of Hemaangada, said, "Once, in the beautiful garden of Shivanakara

The forty-sixth chapter: There were four wives of the king named Suredev: Vasushena, Vasundhara, Dharini and Prithvi. And there were four maidservants of these queens: Shrimati, Vitashoka, Vimala and Vasantika. ||352|| All four of them went to the forest one day and performed religious acts like charity in the presence of a sage. ||353|| As a result of their good deeds, they became the wives of Prati-Indra in the Achyuta heaven. Their names were: Ratisha, Susima, Sukhavati and Subhaga. You are all those queens, and your maidservants became the daughters of the Vyantara gods: Chitrashna, Chitravega, Dhanavati and Dhanshri. ||354|| After his death, king Suredev became the city guard named Pingala. He was imprisoned due to his own fault. Suredev's mother was the daughter of a king and she married Shripala. ||355|| During their wedding ceremony, all the prisoners were released, including Pingala. Now he has renounced the world and will be born in the Achyuta heaven. He will be your husband! ||356|| While the sage was speaking these sweet words, Pingala renounced the world and was born in the Achyuta heaven. He came back and fulfilled the sage's words. At that time, the four Vyantara daughters came to the omniscient god and asked about their future husband. ||357|| The sage said: "The son of the aforementioned Pingala, named Atipingala, will renounce the world and become your husband." ||358|| Hearing these words, the four goddesses went to worship Atipingala. Seeing him, they were overcome with desire. ||359|| They heard about the character of the sage named Ratikul and his father, Maninagadatta. ||360||

The forty-seventh chapter, my dear, another story is presented there, do you remember it? He asked her again, "Is it related to Shri Pal Chakravarti?"  "Yes, I remember the story of the fortunate Shri Pal Chakravarti, as if I saw it today," she said, and began to tell the story.  

In the eastern Videha region of Jambudvipa, there is a city called Pundarikin, which is as famous as Indra's city, Amaravati.  

Shri Pal and Vasu Pal, two brothers like the sun and moon, or like power and valor, conquered the entire earth and ruled it together.  

One day, the gardener came to Vasu Pal's mother, Kubera Shri, and said, "Your husband, Muni Raja, has attained Kevala Jnana on the mountain called Suragiri."  Hearing this, she went forward seven steps, bowed down, gave the gardener a reward, and announced in the city, "Everyone should come to see the Lord with offerings."  She herself went first and worshipped the Lord.  Behind her, Shri Pal and Vasu Pal also went with great joy.  

On the way, they reached a beautiful forest full of excellent trees.  In that forest, under a banyan tree with a statue of a deity, Maharaja Jagat Pal Chakravarti had taken samayam.  Below that tree, a beautiful dance was taking place, which both brothers watched with great respect.  

Seeing this, Kumar Shri Pal said, "This man is dancing in a woman's dress, and this woman is dancing in a man's form.  If this woman were to dance in her own dress, it would be a very good dance."  Hearing this, the dancer fainted.

Chapter Forty-Seventh
At that time, a woman, with due respect, informed the future Chakravarti about the means to make the dancers aware. ||13|| The king of the beautiful city, Shripura, was named Shridhara. His queen was named Shrimati, and their daughter was named Jayavati. ||14|| At the time of her birth, the knowers of auspicious signs declared that she would be the queen of the Chakravarti. And the sign of that Chakravarti is that he knows the difference between a male and female dancer. ||15|| We have come to test him, knowing that he is the Chakravarti. By good fortune, we have seen you, who are like a treasure. ||16|| My name is Priyarati, and this is my daughter, Madanavega, who dances in the form of a man. And this is Vasava, a famous dancer who dresses as a woman. ||17|| Hearing this, the king was pleased and satisfied the woman as was appropriate. Then, bowing to his father, he went towards the mountain of the gods, Surgiri. He mounted a horse brought by someone and rode with a focused mind. ||18|| For a while, the horse ran on the earth, but then, assuming the form of a celestial being, it flew into the sky. ||19|| The god who lived near the image under the banyan tree challenged the celestial being. Fearing the god's challenge, the celestial being, Ashanivega, released the young man, Shripal, using his Parnalagghu Vidya, on the peak of the Ratnavarta mountain. ||20|| The god saw that the young man would benefit greatly by staying on that mountain, so he left without taking him along. The young man, too, bathed in a lake and removed the fatigue of the journey. As he sat there, six princesses emerged from a white palace. Recognizing him as the prince, they greeted him appropriately and began to tell their story. They mentioned their lineage, family, and names, and said, "Ashanivega, the celestial being, forcibly brought us here and left us." ||21-26||

**40.**  The Kumar, considering the matter carefully, replied, "I have taken a vow at the time of my Upanayana, given to me by my Gurus, that I will not accept any other girl except the one given to me by my parents and Gurus."

**41.**  Hearing this, all the girls, filled with the essence of love, tried in various ways to attract the Kumar, but when they failed, Vidyudvega, leaving her beloved Sri Pal on the roof of the house, closed the door from outside and went to call his parents.

**42.**  Meanwhile, Kumar Sri Pal, wearing a red blanket, fell asleep. A Bherunda bird, seeing him, mistook him for a piece of meat and picked him up, intending to eat him on the top of the Siddhakut Chaitya. But seeing the Kumar moving, it left him. This is the natural quality of birds.

**43.**  After that, Sri Pal descended from the top of the Siddhakut, bathed in the lake, and, taking fragrant flowers, circumambulated the Jinalaya with devotion and began to praise. At that moment, the door of the Chaitya opened by itself. Seeing this, he was very happy and, after paying homage to the Jinenadradev according to the rituals, sat down comfortably.

**44.**  At that moment, a Vidyadhara appeared and, lifting the Kumar, took him away through the sky. While traveling, they reached the beautiful city of Shivankarpur. The king's name was Anilvega, and his wife's name was Kantvati. They had a daughter named Bhogavati, who was sleeping on a soft bed in a palace made of crystal in the sky. Seeing her, the Vidyadhara asked Sri Pal, "Who is this young lady?"

**45.**  The Kumar replied, "This is Bhogavati, the daughter of Anilvega, the king of Shivankarpur."

The Vidyadhara, seeing the Kumar, became very attached to him and said, "You should not leave her." The Kumar, hearing all this and thinking carefully, gave a suitable answer, "I have taken a vow at the time of my Upanayana, given to me by my Gurus, that I will not accept any other girl except the one given to me by my parents and Gurus."

The wicked one said to the serpent-like girl, "This is the Adipurana."  Then, enraged, the Vidyaadhara said, "Let this wicked one be thrown away!"  ||52||  "Let him be thrown into a dense forest, fit to bear the burden of severe penance."  Following this command, the Vidyaadhara... ||53||  ...made the beautiful Sripaal Kumar, who was in the form of an old man, fall into the cremation ground near the beautiful city, situated at the northern range of the Vijaya mountain, using the Sheetavaitali Vidya.  ||54||  There, a woman born in an untouchable family, made her son-in-law into a dog and made him roll around her daughter's feet, thus greatly pleasing her daughter.  Then, that wicked Chandali restored his original form.  ||55||  Seeing this, the Kumar, fearing that these Vidyaadharas are capable of changing their forms at will, started to worry.  He was like someone going to Yama, his hair was like the blooming flowers of Kash, and his body was wrinkled like the waves of the ocean of old age.  ||56||  Seeing his form, created by the wicked Vidyaadharas, he was overwhelmed with shame and sorrow.  From there, he went forward.  ||57||  There, he requested the sister of Bhogavati, Harieketo, who had mastered the Vidya.  She, taking the form of a corpse, immediately vomited something into the Kumar's hand and said, "Drink this without any hesitation."  The Kumar immediately drank it.  ||58||  Seeing this, Harieketo, pleased, said to the Kumar, "You have attained the Vidya that destroys all diseases."  He gave him the Vidya and left happily.  The Kumar then regained his original form.  ||59||  While walking, he saw a banyan tree standing below.  He asked, "What is this place?"  He was told... ||60||

Chapter Forty-Seven
485
In the eastern part of the Vijayardha mountain and the western part of the Neelagiri, there is a country called Suseema, and in it is a city called Mahanagara. 65
You should understand the true nature of the Bhootaranya forest. In this forest, there are seven stones. 66
Whoever places these stones one on top of the other will attain the position of Chakravarti. This is the order of the omniscient gods. 67
Seeing this feat, the Vidyaadhara went to inform the king of the city. The Kumar, feeling dejected, left from there. 68
Seeing a decrepit old woman sitting under a tree, the Kumar, who spoke sweet words, asked her, "Which path leads to the country of Pushkalavati?" 69
The old woman replied, "It is not possible to go there without the sky path, because that country is twenty-five yojanas beyond the Vijayardha mountain." 70
Hearing this, the prince Sri Pal asked her, "Tell me any way to go there." 71
She said, "In this Jambudvipa, there is a country called Vatsakavati. On the Vijayardha mountain of that country, there is a city called Rajapura. In that city, the Chakravarti king of the Vidyaadharas, Dharanikampa, resides. His radiant queen is called Suprabha. I am the famous daughter of both of them, my name is Sukhavati. I am proficient in all three types of knowledge: jati vidya, kul vidya, and siddha vidya. 72-74
One day, I went to see my dear friend, Pippala, the daughter of King Akampan, on the Vijayardha mountain in the country of Vatsakavati. There, I saw a strange blanket and asked her, "My dear friend, tell me, where did you get this blanket?" 75
She said, "I got this blanket by my own order." 76

Page #504:

The Adipurana
She also spoke of the measure, saying, "This is the order." Having obtained the blanket, she completed it, and then she went to the place where the blanket was kept. ||77|| Her companions came together, and they were always called Madanavati and Kalnavya. ||78|| Seeing the end of the blanket, she saw the gem-studded ring, and she remembered the order, and the letters "Sri Pal" were inscribed on it. ||79|| Then, with a heart that was not like that of an A-kayasaya, she thought, "How did this Sri Pal, who bears the name, come to this world of the Vidyadharas?" ||80|| To be sure of this, she went to the city of Pundarikani, and after bowing to the Jina, she stood before him. ||81|| Having learned from your mother's account of your journey, I have decided to bring you back. ||82|| Coming, she saw the one who was filled with the energy of lightning, and she said to her, "I will unite you with your beloved." ||83|| Having reassured your beloved, she went out and went to the Jina temple on the Siddhakut. ||84|| Having bowed, she said, "Come with me, Pundarikani, to see your mother, brother, and others." ||85|| "If you wish," she said, "then come." "Why are you so old?" she asked. "I am old because of the words of the Kumar," she said. ||86|| Hearing the words of the Kumar, she became old. "And what about you?" she asked, laughing. ||87|| Overwhelmed by old age, she said, "Why has my body become like this?" ||88|| Hearing this, she said, "There are two daughters of Piplala and Madanavati, who are famous for their beauty. ||89|| There is also a powerful man named Dhumavega, and a great hero named Harivara. ||90|| I have brought you to this city to protect you from them." ||91|| "Because of my lack of knowledge, I have revealed the two forms of Maya. Kumar, because of your father's eating of the sweet fruit of immortality, ||92|| 

Page #505:
---------------------------
The Forty-Seventh Chapter

The Vidhyadharas, one named Dhumvega and the other Harivar, are both very powerful. Fearing them, I have created two illusory forms through the power of Vidya to hide you and bring you to the city. O Kumar, eat this fruit, which is as sweet as nectar, and quench your hunger and fatigue. Then, mount me and we will quickly proceed to the city.

Hearing this, the Kumar said, "A woman's form is unsuitable for me to mount. I do not even touch a woman. How can I mount her? I have taken such a vow before my Guru." Hearing this, she thought and said, "What has happened now?" With the power of Vidya, she immediately assumed the form of a man and carried the Kumar with great speed.

On the way, she reached the Siddhakut Chaityalaya, paid her respects, and sat down to rest. On the same day, Bhogavati saw in a dream that the moon, adorned with radiance and arts, had entered our house and returned. Seeing this dream, she came to the Siddhakut Chaityalaya to worship for the sake of averting inauspiciousness. She was accompanied by the beautiful Kantvati, the chaste Ratnavega, Suvega, Amitmati, Ratikanta, Chittavega, Pippala, Madanavati, Vidyudvega, and many other princesses. All of them came and circumambulated the Jin Mandir with great devotion, paid their respects according to the rituals, performed puja, and then all of them were eager to praise. Even while praising, their minds were agitated.

In the same Chaityalaya, there stood a prince named Shiv Kumar, whose face was crooked. But as soon as he came near Shri Pal Kumar, his face became straight. Seeing this, Sukhavati removed him from his place and placed him elsewhere. In that Chaityalaya, Shri Pal Kumar was looking at his own form in the water, as he wished, with his Kamarupa Mudra. The sinful Harivar Vidhyadhar saw him doing this and, out of anger, threw the Kumar, who had done good deeds in his previous birth, into the Mahakal Guha, a place designated for punishment.

The previous order proved true, and the king, pleased, wished to give his daughter to the prince. But seeing the prince's unwillingness, he instructed his son, Varensen, to quickly take him to his relatives. 

Varensen took the prince and left him outside the city of Vimala, suffering from thirst. He went to fetch water. 

At that time, Sukhavati, assuming the form of a hunchback, arrived there. She touched the prince with her garland of flowers, quenched his thirst, and transformed him into a maiden. 

Seeing this maiden, both Dhumvega and Harivar desired her, and both became envious of each other, wanting to claim her. 

Seeing their mutual hatred, their relatives intervened, saying, "Your fight is in vain. Let her have the husband she desires." 

Thus, restrained by their relatives, they ceased their animosity. For whose love is not broken by a woman? 

The maiden, however, desired neither of them. Sukhavati took her away in the form of a maiden to where Kanta, Sukanta, Ratikanta, and Kantavati resided. 

Seeing the prince in his original form, some of the maidens felt ashamed, while others were delighted. This is natural, for women's emotions are diverse. 

Sri Pal slept there that night. At dawn, Sukhavati woke him up with great effort. Opening his eyes, the prince asked her, "Did you leave me alone here and go somewhere?" 

Sukhavati replied, "I did not go anywhere. I have always been by your side. The fortune-tellers have said that you will obtain a woman's treasure here. You have nothing to fear. Until now, I have hidden my true form, but today I have come to meet you in my true form."

Hearing these words, Shri Pal was very happy and went ahead from there to the south part of Vijayardha mountain, near the city of Gajpur. || 128 || There, a big elephant was pulling out a pillar and was in a state of frenzy. The Kumar made him calm by using the 32 prescribed methods of controlling elephants. || 129 || After that, as the sun rose, the people of the city knew that the Kumar had conquered the elephant. They were all happy and raised colorful flags on their houses. They were inspired by the Kumar's auspicious arrival and welcomed him. || 130-131 || The Kumar went from there into the sky and reached the city of Hayapur. There, a horse was standing near the Kumar, circling him. The Kumar saw all this but was not surprised. || 132 || When the people of the city knew about this, they honored the Kumar. The Kumar left from there and went ahead as he wished. || 133 || While walking, he reached the mountain called Susima, which was situated in the middle of the four countries. There, many people were gathered for some reason. They were trying to pull out swords from their sheaths, but none of them could do it. But the Kumar pulled it out with ease. There were many bamboo sticks entangled around it. Seeing him pull it out from such a place, everyone honored the Kumar greatly. || 134-136 || At that time, a mute man came there and bowed to the Kumar, saying "Victory, Victory". || 137 || There, a man with a crooked finger came. As soon as he saw the Kumar, his finger became straight. He stretched out his finger, folded his hands and stood near the Kumar, bowing to him. || 138 || There, a man was making diamond powder, but it was not being made. But in the presence of the Kumar, it was made. So, he also bowed to the Kumar with great humility.

The city of Vijayapur was the abode of the one who drew the sword from its sheath. He was the future commander-in-chief of the Chakravarti, Sri Pal. || 140 || The city of Vijayapur was also the home of the daughter of the king Varakirti, Kirtimati. The Niti-gyanis had predicted that her husband would be Sri Pal, the Chakravarti, and that he would be recognized by his act of drawing the sword from its sheath. || 141 || The city of Shreyaspur was the birthplace of the one who would become the future priest of Sri Pal. The king of Shreyaspur was Shiva Sena, and his daughter was named Vitashoka, whose eyes were like lotuses. The Niti-gyanis had decreed that her husband would be the one who would make her, who was mute, speak. || 142 - 143 || The one with the crooked finger was born in the city of Shilppur. He was destined to be the architect of Sri Pal. The king of Shilppur was named Narapati, and his daughter was named Rati Vimala. The Niti-gyanis had revealed that her husband would be the one whose gaze would straighten her crooked finger, and that their union would be long-lasting. || 144 - 145 || The one who was making the powder of diamonds was destined to be the chief minister of Sri Pal. He was born in the city of Dhanyapur, and the king of Dhanyapur was named Vishal. His daughter was named Vimalseena. The Niti-gyanis had declared that her husband would be the one whose arrival would cause the diamond powder to be made. He would be the powerful Sri Pal. || 146 - 147 || Having learned of the decrees of the Niti-gyanis, all the men went to their respective cities. At that time, Sukhavati, carrying the Kumar, began to travel through the sky. || 148 || While traveling, they encountered the enemy, Dhumvega. Upon seeing the Kumar, he roared in a terrifying voice, and stood in the sky, blocking their path, brandishing both a sword and a khetak. || 149 || At that time, the deity who was the protector of the previously mentioned pleasure garden, in the form of a statue, appeared before Sukhavati. || 150 ||

Leaving the Adipurana, she approached the Kumar and, addressing the vile Vidyaadhara, said without fear, "Fight and conquer!" ||15|| She, too, leaving the Kumar, fought fiercely with Dhumavega on the battlefield, and for a long time, she restrained him with her own Vidyaas. ||15|| The Kumar, too, slowly approached a nearby rock, where his mother, Devasri, who had become a Yakshi in a previous life, was present. ||153|| Approaching him, she touched him with her hand, removed his fatigue, and said, "Kumar, quickly enter the heart (of the lake)." ||154|| Hearing her words, he, trusting her, entered the lake and stood on top of a stone pillar that night. ||155|| Performing the five prostrations, he rose in the morning and, looking towards the north of the lake, saw the image of Jinendra. ||156|| He offered worship and prostrations with flowers and other offerings. Following the Yakshi's instructions, he saw the thousand-petaled lotus as a chakra-ratna, the tortoise as a parasol, the king of snakes with a thousand hoods as a staff-ratna, the frog as a crown jewel, the crocodile as a leather-ratna, and the glowing red scorpion as a kakini-mani. ||157-159|| With a joyful heart, he took up the staff, adorned with shining jewels, and wearing divine ornaments made of all kinds of jewels, given by the Yakshi, he emerged from the cave. ||160|| Just as the pratipada of the bright fortnight arrives for the growth of the moon, so too, having defeated Dhumavega, the valiant Sukhavati, armed with a sword, arrived for the growth of the Kumar. ||161-162|| Accompanied by her, he went from there and reached the mountain of Suragiri, where he met the assembly of Gunapala Jinendra. ||163||

'Then, being pleased with the blessings, he sat down in the presence of his mother. He had obtained your proximity by the influence of Sukhavati. ||16|| The younger brother praised them, saying, "May you be well." It is the natural nature of the virtuous to praise those who have done them a favor. ||166|| Having received the answers from Bhagavan to the questions of King Vasupala, he had obtained many benefits while staying in the company of the Vidyadharas. ||167|| Then, after seven days, he entered the city with ease. For those who have accumulated great merit, even calamities become wealth. ||168|| Vasupala Kumar's wedding took place with Varisheṇa and other girls. The wedding was adorned with many kinds of auspiciousness. ||169|| At that time, Sri Pala Kumar was also adorned with eighty-four auspicious girls, including Jayavati. ||170|| Like the sun and moon, who, with their radiance, encompass the entire sky, both brothers, protecting the earth, enjoyed happiness for a long time. ||171|| Some time later, a son named Gunapala, radiant with virtues, was born to Sri Pala from his queen Jayavati. And in the armory, a Chakra-ratna appeared. ||172|| His body adorned with Lakshmi, Sri Pala, experiencing all the pleasures described by the Chakravarti, was even surpassing the play of Indra. ||173|| Jayavarma, the brother of Jayavati, had a daughter named Jayasena, whose beauty was like an army, conquering all. ||174|| Besides her, there were Manovega, Ashanivar, Shiva, Ashanivega, Hariketu, and many other excellent Vidyadhara kings.

Perhaps, motivated by the attainment of time, etc., he looked up. He saw the moon eclipsed by darkness. ||177|| Seeing the lunar eclipse, he thought, "Alas, if this is the state of the moon, what is the state of other sinful beings in the cycle of existence?" ||178|| Thus, becoming free from ignorance, the noble-minded one, with his memory of his previous birth, remembered his connection to his past life as if it were before his eyes. ||179|| In the western part of Pushkarardha, there was a famous country called Padmaka, ruled by King Kanakarath, the lord of the earth, in the city of Kantapur. ||180|| His beloved was Kanakaprabha, the golden chariot. They had a son named Kanakaprabha, who eclipsed the sun with his brilliance. ||181|| In a garden, my beloved, named Vidyutprabha, was bitten by a snake. I was distressed by her separation. ||182|| Along with my parents and siblings, who were very affectionate, I attained the highest restraint near the sage Samadhigupta. ||183|| There, I deeply contemplated the sixteen contemplations, including perception and purity, and at the end of my life, I was born as an Ahamindra in the celestial chariot called Jayanta. ||184|| Then, I came from there and was born here as Gunapala, the son of Sri Pala. ||185|| The best, Kubera Kanta, and the others who had become Lokantik deities through their austerities, came and enlightened him. Thus, Gunapala, having attained enlightenment, destroyed the snare of delusion and practiced austerities. He destroyed his harmful actions and attained the Sayogipada, the thirteenth stage of virtue. ||186-187|| Yasapala, the son of Sukhavati, also took initiation from Gunapala Jinendra. ||188||

The King of Kings, Sri Pal, approached him with great joy and, after worshipping him, heard the Dharma of both the householder and the monk. Then, with great humility, he asked about his previous birth. The Lord said, "All this was told by the beautiful Sulochana, the wife of King Jayakumar, when she was asked. She said:
In the city of  Pundarikin in the Videha region, there lived a king named Yashpal. In the same city, there lived a merchant named Sarvasamriddh. His wife, Dhanshri, was a wealth-increasing woman and the younger sister of Dhananjaya. Their son was the esteemed Seth Sarvadayit, and his sister was Sarvadayita, a very virtuous woman. Sarvadayit had two wives: Jayasena, the daughter of Sagar Sena, and Jayadatta, the daughter of Seth Dhananjaya.
Seth Sarvadayit's father had a younger sister named Devashri, who was married to Seth Sagar Sena. They had two sons, Sagardatt and Samudradatt, and a daughter named Sagardatta. Sagar Sena's younger sister, Sagar Sena, had two children: a daughter named Vaishravandatta and a son named Vaishravandatt. Vaishravandatt was a partner of Seth Sarvadayit.
Vaishravandatta became the wife of Seth Sagardatt, and the wife of Seth Samudradatt was named Sarvadayita. Sagardatta was married to Seth Vaishravandatt. Thus, their time passed continuously with great love.
The merchant Dhananjaya, who had earned a lot of wealth, once showed his respect to King Yashpal by presenting him with many precious jewels.

Then, due to the separation from her son, Sarvadayita, after being condemned by the women, died and attained a male birth. || 212 || After that, Samudradatta also arrived with his caravan. Hearing about his wife's situation, he condemned his brother. || 213 || Who could tolerate the act of the श्रेष्ठी (wealthy merchant) who, without any fault, prevented his wife from entering the house? || 214 ||

"While I am the elder and worthy, why has this श्रेष्ठी become the श्रेष्ठी in my presence?" Thus, Vaishravana, the श्रेष्ठी, was angry. || 215 || Vaishravana, Sagardatta, and Samudradatta were all filled with envy. || 216 ||

The Acharya says that envy in the case of difficult austerities is sometimes good for people, but not in other cases. One day, the श्रेष्ठी Sarvadayita asked Jitshatru, "Why do you resemble Samudradatta? Why is your form similar to his? And why have you come to the assembly?" Then, Jitshatru narrated the story of his arrival in detail. || 217-218 ||

Seeing the ring on his hand, the श्रेष्ठी was certain that "This is my nephew, no one else." Remembering his own and his brother-in-law's lack of consideration (acting without thinking), he gave Jitshatru his daughter, Sarvashri, a lot of wealth, and the position of श्रेष्ठी, and became detached. || 219-220 ||

At that time, Jayadhama, the Vidyadhara who raised Jitshatru, his wife Jayabhama, Jayasena, and Jayadatta, his wives, Vaishravana's wife Sagardatta, and Vaishravana's sister Vaishravana, and many others attained self-knowledge. Along with them, the श्रेष्ठी went to the Muni Rativara and practiced restraint. || 221-222 ||

Having attained the Muni Rativara and practiced restraint for a long time, all of them eventually attained the heavenly realm. || 223 ||

Having come from heaven to this place, Jayadhama, the Vidhyadhara, became Vasulo here. Jayabhama was also born. ||224||
From Jayavati, Jayasena was born. Pippali was born as Jayadatta, who was Madanavati. ||225||
Vaisravana Datta became Vidyudvega, skilled in all arts. Sagardatta, having come from heaven, became Sukhavati. ||226||
At that time, Sagardatta, having come from the heavenly realm, became the beloved son of Pururavas, named Harivara. ||227||
Samudradatta was born as the renowned son of Jvalanavega. His son, named Dhumavega, was a man of great valor, known for his knowledge. ||228||
Vaisravana Datta became Asanivega here. The most beloved Seth, Sri Pal, is you. ||229||
You, having rejected your son-in-law, were separated from your relatives. Therefore, those who were your enemies in that life are your enemies in this life as well. ||230||
Those who were your wives in that life are also your beloved wives in this life. You did not harm your sister's child, therefore you have been reunited with your brothers and sisters in this life. ||231||
As a result of the penance you performed in that life, you have become the emperor of the entire world. By abandoning all attachments, you will soon attain liberation. ||232||
Hearing the words of the Tirthankara, Gunapal, all people, filled with wonder, abandoned their mutual hatred. ||233||
Thereafter, the virtuous Sri Pal, with a steady mind, drank the nectar of Dharma, to destroy birth, disease, old age, and death, which constantly follow him. ||234||
He thought, "This empire of the emperor is like the life of a potter, for just as a potter, by rotating his wheel, earns his livelihood from the pots and other vessels made of clay,

466. This life is like the wind, pleasures are like clouds, association is fleeting, the body is a vessel of sin, and worldly possessions are as fickle as lightning. ||236||

Youth is a dense forest, leading to the path of delusion. The pleasure that one finds in worldly objects is actually a search for misery. ||237||

All these things seem pleasurable as long as the mind is deluded. But when the mind becomes pure, what is there to abandon except these things? ||238||

If the tree of the mind keeps growing with the shoots of poisonous desires, how can it bear the fruits of happiness in the branches of sensual pleasures? ||239||

I have enjoyed all kinds of pleasures for a long time, but I have never found even a little bit of satisfaction in this world that could destroy my thirst. ||240||

Even if all the objects of our desires were to be fulfilled, they would not bring us even a little bit of happiness. ||241||

It is said that the attainment of pleasure from women is the mark of manhood. But what greater degradation can there be than this? Therefore, one should become a true man by realizing the true happiness within oneself. ||242||

Thus, abandoning the crookedness of his mind, Sri Pal Chakravarti decided to renounce all his possessions, including his royal wheel. ||243||

Then, he crowned his son, Sukhavati, who was named Narapal, on his high throne. He himself, along with his queens like Jayavati and kings like Vasupal, took the vows of renunciation. ||244-245||

... He practiced both external and internal austerities, climbed the ladder of penance, and, within a month, destroyed his delusion. ||256||

Having attained the excellent character known as "Yathakyata," which is free from impurities, he meditated on the true nature of the self through the second white meditation, which is devoid of all thoughts. ||247||

In the same way, the Chakravarti rotates his wheel (Chakra Ratna) and earns his livelihood from the gems and other things that are born from the earth. Therefore, his kingdom is to be condemned. ||235||

Having destroyed the three destructive karmas, he attained the nine Kevala-labdhis. Having entered the Sayoga-sthana, he became a Viyoga, free from all karmas. || 248 ||  He manifested the excellence of his qualities by destroying the three bodies: Audarika, Tejas, and Karman. He attained infinite, peaceful, new, and supreme happiness. || 249 ||  His queens, having performed various austerities, became goddesses in their respective large vimanas in the heaven. || 250 ||  Having heard this story and bowed down to Gunapala Tirthankara, we both went to heaven. We enjoyed happiness there and were born here at the end of our lifespan due to the remaining special punya. || 251 ||  Sulochana said these things clearly. Jayakumar was very pleased at that time due to the influence of his beloved's intelligence. || 252 ||  At that time, all those present in the assembly believed what Sulochana said. It is right, because who is there who is not wicked, who would not believe the words spoken by the virtuous? || 253 ||  Thus, enjoying the kingdom and the essence of pleasures continuously, and delighting each other, they both spent their time happily. || 254 ||  At that time, the Prajnapti and other vidyas, which were the means of increasing Lakshmi in the previous existence of the Vidyadharas, were also obtained by Jayakumar and Sulochana with great love. || 255 ||  By the power of those vidyas, King Jayakumar desired to roam in the countries fit for the gods with his beloved Sulochana. Therefore, he appointed his younger brother Vijayakumar to the affairs of the kingdom. || 256 ||  Then, Jayakumar, whose vehicles were created by vidya, roamed with his beloved Sulochana in the oceans, Kulachala mountains, and various beautiful forests. || 257 ||  While roaming elsewhere, the sound of the clouds, born from Mount Kailasa, caused him to deviate slightly from Sulochana. || 258 ||

The (Jain) Purana praised the greatness of the two (Jayakumar and Sulonchana). He, being delighted by their virtues, was amazed. The sun-like (Jayakumar) came to them, being fond of their virtues. ||21|| Having narrated his own story, he asked for forgiveness from the two youths. After worshipping with great jewels, he went to heaven. ||272|| "Thus, having enjoyed for a long time, he attained equal happiness with his beloved. Having returned to the city, he experienced the essence of happiness." ||27|| Then, on another occasion, Jayakumar, who had attained enlightenment, like the sound of clouds, went to the Tirthankara, the Lord of the pilgrimage sites, and worshipped him, the object of joy. ||24|| Having asked questions about Dharma, and having heard the appropriate answers from him, he narrated the stories of Aakshepini, etc., and discussed the bondage and arising of karma, etc. ||275|| Having attained the essence of peace, by being freed from karma, Jayakumar, with a wise mind, performed the coronation of Anantvirya, the son of Shivankar Mahadevi, who is beloved by the world. ||276|| Anantvirya, who is invincible, with infinite strength, a master of weapons and scriptures, whose fame spread from his childhood, whose valor extended to the conquest of enemies, whose charity satisfied all the beggars, and whose truth never wavered even in dreams, was given all his wealth by Jayakumar. ||277-278|| Then, Jayakumar, who desired to attain the supreme state, who was free from anxiety and attachment, who had renounced his family, who had controlled his senses, who had dispelled the great delusion, and who had accumulated good deeds, having attained the highest state of purity, took initiation along with his younger brothers, Vijay, Jayant, Sanjayant, and others who had decided to renounce possessions, who were free from attachment and aversion, and also with Ravikriti, Ravivijay, Arindam, Arinjaya, Sujaya, Sukant, the seventh Ajitjaya, Mahajaya, Ativirya, Varunjaya, Raviviriya, and other sons of the emperor who had attained renunciation. ||279-283||

**Sampaṇ**

This is a special vessel, fit to bear the great Dharma. Thus, the King of the Universe, the Lord of Lords, bestowed him. ||28||

He has renounced all possessions, attained the essence of the scriptures, achieved supreme restraint, and is constantly growing with the seven perfections. ||285||

With the pure light of the four knowledges, he has dispelled the vast darkness of the mind. He became the seventy-first Ganadhara of the Lord. ||286||

Sulochana, overwhelmed with grief at the loss of her husband, was like a withered creeper fallen from a blooming tree. ||287||

Pacified by the queen of the Chakravarti, the radiant Subhadra, she quickly took initiation near the Brahmi Aryika, and, destined for liberation in the coming Kalpa, she practiced austerities for a long time. ||288||

She became a celestial being in the Achyuta heaven, in the Uttara Vimana.  Aditya Tirtha, the Lord, also continues to guide the path to liberation. ||289||

He is surrounded by eighty-four Ganadharas, adorned with various perfections, and by the Vrishabhasena and other Ganadharas. ||290||

He is accompanied by four thousand seven hundred fifty former knowers, and four thousand one hundred fifty teacher monks. ||291||

He is surrounded by nine thousand monks possessing the eye of the third knowledge, and is endowed with twenty thousand Kevala knowers. ||292||

He is constantly growing with the twenty thousand six hundred monks possessing the perfection of Vikriya, and is endowed with twelve thousand seven hundred fifty Manahparyaya knowers. ||293||

He is revered by twelve thousand seven hundred fifty Vadis, who have refuted all opponents, and all together, he is surrounded by eighty-four thousand eighty-four monks, who constantly worship him. ||294||

He is worshipped by three hundred fifty thousand Aryikas, who praise his virtues, and by three hundred thousand Shravakas, who serve him. ||295||

He is praised by five hundred thousand Shravikas, who are devoted to him, and by the four types of Devas and Devis, who praise his lotus feet. ||296||

At that time, Jayakumar was shining near Rishabhadeva, as if the great King Bharat had entrusted him to the Lord, understanding that he was a special vessel fit to bear the heavy Dharma. ||284||

Thus, he who has renounced all possessions, has attained the essence of the scriptures, has achieved supreme restraint, and is constantly growing with the seven perfections, and with the pure light of the four knowledges, he has dispelled the vast darkness of the mind. He became the seventy-first Ganadhara of the Lord. ||285-286||

On the other hand, Sulochana, overwhelmed with grief at the loss of her husband, was like a withered creeper fallen from a blooming tree. ||287||

Pacified by the queen of the Chakravarti, the radiant Subhadra, she quickly took initiation near the Brahmi Aryika, and, destined for liberation in the coming Kalpa, she practiced austerities for a long time. ||288||

She became a celestial being in the Achyuta heaven, in the Uttara Vimana.  Aditya Tirtha, the Lord, also continues to guide the path to liberation. ||289||

The Adipurana, revered by the four-footed, bird, and other species, is marked by the rise of thirty-four extraordinary qualities. [298]
He is endowed with unique knowledge, unique vision, unique happiness, and unique strength, all arising from the soul itself. [299]
He is adorned with beauty and possesses the seven supreme abodes, including the abode of his own kind. [300]
He is endowed with eight miraculous powers, has destroyed the four karmic poisons, and is known by a thousand and eight names, beginning with Vrishabha. [301]
He has blossomed the lotus forest of the worthy beings with the rays of his words. [302]
Bharata, with folded hands like a budding lotus, worshipped him and asked about the nature of Dharma. [303]
The Lord replied, "He who guides disciples away from evil paths and towards the highest state is called Dharma. Dharma has four aspects: Right Faith, Right Knowledge, Right Conduct, and Right Austerity. This Dharma is primarily about duty." [287-303]
The true faith in the seven principles, including the soul, arising from oneself or from the teachings of others, is called Right Faith. [304]
This Right Faith is free from doubts and other defects, and is analyzed through three states: the state of the worldly, the state of the liberated, and the state of the partially liberated. [305]
The true knowledge of the seven principles, including the soul, free from doubt, delusion, and indecision, is called Right Knowledge. [306]
Conduct that does not lead to the accumulation of karma is called Right Conduct or Restraint. [307]
The practice that leads to the destruction of karma is called Austerity. [308]
These four qualities, when accompanied by passions, are the causes of heaven. When free from passions, they are the causes of both heaven and liberation for those who seek the welfare of the soul. [309]
These four are the paths to liberation and are difficult to attain for beings. [310]
Falsehood, violation of vows, negligence, passions, and auspicious and inauspicious karmic forces are the causes of karmic bondage for beings. [311]

There are five kinds of Mithyatva, 108 kinds of Aviriti, 15 kinds of Pramada, and four kinds of Kashaya. Those who possess the eye of right knowledge should know the fifteen kinds of Yoga. The wise have described karma according to its root and its results - there are eight root types of karma and 148 result types. ||310-311|| One should know that there are four kinds of bondage, based on the differences in nature, etc. When karma arises, it becomes the cause of both the fruit and the bondage. Meaning - When the previously bound karma arises, its fruit of happiness, sorrow, etc. is experienced, and new karma is bound. ||312|| You are devotees, near-liberated, and knowers of the scriptures, therefore abandon this fearful household life, which is full of faults, sorrow, old age, death, and other sins, and practice the six virtues of secrecy, samiti, dharma, anupreksha, parishahjay, and charitra well. ||313|| In those who are free from passions, such as those who have the characteristics of Pulaka, etc., or those who are free from passions, such as those who have the characteristics of Anugara, etc., or those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are free from passions, such as those who are

To attain the supreme fruit of liberation, the Lord, along with his disciples, spent a period of one lakh years minus fourteen days.  And when fourteen days remained in his lifespan, he, defying the yogis, went to reside on Mount Kailasa, between the peaks of Shri Shikhar and Siddha Shikhar, on the full moon day of the month of Pausha.  || 322-323 ||

On that very day, King Bharat saw in his dream that the great Mount Meru had reached the Siddha Kshetra with its height. || 324 ||

On that very day, Prince Arka Kirti also saw in his dream that a great medicinal tree was destroying the disease of birth for humans and then going to heaven. || 325 ||

On that very day, the householder saw in his dream that a Kalpavriksha was continuously giving desired fruits to people according to their wishes and was now ready to go to heaven. || 326 ||

The Prime Minister saw in his dream that a gem-island, giving a collection of gems to those who wished to take them, was now ready to go to the sky. || 327 ||

The Commander-in-Chief saw in his dream that a lion was breaking the cage of vajra and was ready to cross Mount Kailasa. || 328 ||

The wise and valiant son of Jayakumar, Shriman Anantavirya, saw in his dream that the moon was illuminating the three worlds and was going along with the stars. || 329 ||

Sleeping Subhadra saw in her dream that Indrani, along with Yashaswati and Sunanda, was grieving for a long time. || 330 ||

The king of Varanasi, Chitrangada, saw in his dream, with fear and anxiety, that the sun was illuminating the earth and flying towards the sky. || 331 ||

Thus, all the people, starting with Bharat, saw these dreams and at sunrise, they all asked the priest about their meaning. || 332 ||

The priest said, "All these dreams indicate that you are going to attain liberation along with the Lord Vrishabhadeva and many other sages, completely destroying your karmas." || 333 ||

While the priest was explaining the meaning of the dreams to them, a man named Anand came and informed them about the Lord's condition. || 334 ||

He said, "The Lord, with his divine sound, has gathered his lotus-like hands, and the assembly has become like a lake of nectar." || 335 ||

## The Forty-Seventh Chapter

Hearing this, the Chakravarti Bharat, along with all the assembly, went to Mount Kailasa with great speed. There, he circumambulated the Lord Rishabhadeva thrice, offered praise, and performed the Mahamaha puja with devotion, serving the Lord in this way for fourteen days.

On the fourteenth day of the dark fortnight of Magha, at the auspicious time of sunrise and the Abhijit constellation, the Lord Rishabhadeva, facing the east, sat on the Paryakasana along with many munis. He restrained the three yogas with the third, subtle-action-practice, white meditation. Then, residing in the final Gunasthan, he destroyed the destructive karmas with the fourth, reverse-action-cessation, white meditation, in the time it takes to pronounce five short syllables.

Then, with the destruction of the three bodies - the gross, the subtle, and the karmic - he attained the state of Siddhatva. Possessing his eight qualities - right faith, right knowledge, right conduct, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration, right speech, and right livelihood - he instantly entered the Tanuvatavala, where he resides eternally, free from impurities, slightly less than a body, formless, absorbed in the bliss of the Self, and constantly observing the world.

At that time, all the gods came, desiring to perform the Moksha-Kalyanak puja. Considering the Lord's body to be pure, excellent, a means of liberation, clean, and spotless, they placed it in a precious palanquin. Then, the fire that originated from the crown of the Indra of the gods, shining with the brilliance of jewels, and enhanced by sandalwood, agarwood, camphor, saffron, and other fragrant substances, as well as ghee, milk, and other offerings, filled the world with an unprecedented fragrance. They destroyed the present form of the Lord and thus caused him to attain another state.

To the right of the fire pit, where the Lord was worshipped with incense, flowers, etc., they established the fire for the cremation of the bodies of the Ganadharas. To the left, they established the fire for the cremation of the bodies of the Tirthankaras, Ganadharas, and other ordinary Kevalis.

Then, taking the ashes of the Adipurana, the five-blessed ones, they said, "We too shall be like this," and with great devotion, they applied it to their foreheads, both arms, necks, and chests. Considering it most sacred, they were filled with the essence of Dharma and love. 
34-350
With great joy, they all together performed the play of Ananda. Then, they instructed the devotees, "O all you Brahmachari, who hold the seven and other images, you yourselves should establish the three fires, Garhapatya, Ahavaniya, and Dakshinagni, in the three Sandhyas. Near them, establish the Dharmachakra, the umbrella, and the image of the Jina, and worship them with mantras at all three times. Thus, you should become guests, honored by the householders."
351-354
Meanwhile, the fire of sorrow, kindled by love and born from the separation from the beloved, was burning the enlightened mind of Bharata.
355
Seeing this state of Bharata, the Ganadhara, Vrishabhasena, desiring to remove Bharata's sorrow, began to speak clearly about the past lives of all of them.
356
He said, "The soul of Vrishabhadeva was Jayavarman in the first life, Mahabala in the second, Lalitanga in the third, and King Vajrajangha in the fourth. In the fifth life, he was the Arya of Bhogabhumi. In the sixth life, he was Shridharadeva, in the seventh, King Suvidhi, in the eighth, Achyutendra, in the ninth, King Vajranabhi, in the tenth, he was Ahmendra in Sarvarthasiddhi, and from there, he became Vrishabhadeva, worshipped by all the Indras."
357-359
The soul of Shreyans was Dhanshri in the first life, Nirnaayika in the second, Swayamprabha Devi in the third, Shrimati in the fourth, the Arya of Bhogabhumi in the fifth, Swayamprabhadeva in the sixth, Keshava in the seventh, Prati-Indra of Achyutsvarga in the eighth, Dhanadatta in the ninth, Ahmendra in the tenth, and from there, he became...

The greedy one was a cook, then a mongoose, then a Bhoga-bhumika Arya, then a god named Manoraha, then a king named Shantamadan, then a Samanika deva, then a king named Aparajita, then I became Indra, and now my younger brother, Jayasena, has been born, who is extremely powerful.

**Verse 377:**
Jayasena's life was first a greedy cook, then a mongoose, then a Bhoga-bhumika Arya, then a god named Manoraha, then a king named Shantamadan, then a Samanika deva, then a king named Aparajita, then I became Indra, and now my younger brother, Jayasena, has been born, who is extremely powerful.

**Verse 378:**
O Bharata, in this world, which is like a crisis, all beings experience a combination of pleasant and unpleasant things, and ultimately, they are destroyed suddenly. Knowing this, why are you so disheartened? The Lord Vrishabhadeva has attained the incomparable state of liberation by destroying all eight karmas. Why are you feeling sad in such a place of contentment?

**Verse 379:**
O Chakravartin, we are all mortal beings. By the association of the pure-minded Lord, we have destroyed all our karmic impurities and attained our true nature. We will also soon attain the incomparable and rare state of the Lord, which is superior to all other pleasures.

**Verse 380:**
When a dear friend dies, there may be grief because their death is caused by good and bad karmas, and it leads to their rebirth in this world. But if a Siddha, who has destroyed the world and is constantly prayed to, is attained, then how can a wise person grieve if he is not an enemy? Meaning: It is the enemy who grieves, not the friend, so you should all rejoice, not grieve.

**Verse 381:**
O Lord of wealth, all eight evil enemies of Lord Vrishabhadeva, with their roots and branches, have been completely destroyed by his virtues. What is lost here? Abandon your delusion. Focus your pure mind on conquering sorrow.

## Forty-Seventh Chapter

511. If you grieve for your Guru's **deha-chyuti** (departure from the body), then why do the **Ghanatha** (divine beings) who served him even before his birth, and who have **vivridha-raga** (increased attachment), celebrate with joyous dance after his **bhasmasat-kriti** (cremation)?

**Shardaul-vikridita** (a poetic meter)
I do not see the **Vishva-drish** (all-seeing), I do not hear the divine words, I cannot even touch his feet with humility and adorn my crown with the brilliance of his nails. Therefore, I am overwhelmed with grief due to my attachment. But this is a delusion, for it is futile to grieve for the past.

**Vasant-tilaka** (a poetic meter)
O Bharata, you are the **tri-bhuvana-eka-guru-guru** (the supreme Guru of the three worlds), and you are the holder of the three **jnana** (knowledge). Why are you destroying your **udatta-ta** (excellence) with this **moha-vihit** (delusion-induced) attachment? Are you not ashamed to do so, even in front of Indra? Do you not know that you will attain **mukti-gati** (liberation) even before Indra?

**Shardaul-vikridita** (a poetic meter)
What is desirable, what is undesirable? This foolish creature makes futile resolutions, hates some, desires others, and sometimes even reverses these feelings. Therefore, his **papa-anugati** (chain of sins) continues, and he wanders like a poor man, full of fear and sorrow.

**Ho, he is gone, and now he is being served by eight great qualities. What is the loss in this? Therefore, abandon delusion and embrace pure **buddhi** (intellect) to conquer sorrow.** 

Page #530:

## The Adi Purana

Even the **bhavyas** (worthy souls) have to live in this world, which is filled with endless suffering and is devoid of any beginning. This is the state of existence, and it should be condemned.  Wise men should not grieve over this world, or the **bhavyatva** (state of being worthy) of beings, which is multifaceted.  O King, this is the inherent nature of things.  ||386||

O Bharata, you are a knower of the world.  Don't you know that due to endless transformations, this being has had hundreds of relationships over countless eons?  Why are you deluded like an ignorant person? ||387||

The body of Lord Vasudeva, the ruler of the three worlds, is also made by **karma** (actions) and is not permanent.  Therefore, wise men consider it to be **tyajya** (worthy of abandonment). ||388||

The Lord who was visible before is now present in the heart.  Why grieve over this?  Always see him in your mind. ||389||

Thus, contemplating the true nature of things in your mind, extinguish the fire of sorrow with the water of pure knowledge.  This is what the **Ganadhara** (leader of the Jain community) Vrishabha said.  Just as a mountain burnt by fire is calmed by the water of new clouds, the Chakravarti (emperor) was calmed by his words. ||390||

Bharata, who is destined for quick **atma-bodhi** (self-realization) and whose crown is becoming humble, abandoned the sorrow caused by his father's death and bowed to the **Ganadhara** Deva.  He condemned his excessive desire for worldly pleasures and, with a burning desire for **moksha** (liberation), entered his city with great splendor. ||391||

## Hastened and Delayed

Seeing his own face in a bright mirror, he [Bharata] noticed his white hair, like a messenger arriving from the abode of supreme bliss. || 392 ||

Seeing him, those whose hearts were filled with the allure of worldly pleasures, whose minds were filled with the dust of old age, who were eager to attain self-benefit, and whose desire for renunciation was strong and ever-growing, those Bharatas, considering their kingdom like withered grass, bestowed their son, Arka Kirti, with their wealth, their Lakshmi. || 393 ||

Knowing the true nature of all things, and desiring to tread the path of liberation, inaccessible to the lowly, the Chakravarti Bharata embraced the effortless **Yama** and **Samiti**, like a nourishing meal. This is fitting, for those who understand the true nature of things do not seek anything other than **Samyama**. || 364 ||

At that very moment, he attained **Manas-Paryaya Jnana** and then **Kevala Jnana** manifested. His magnificence was revealed at that very moment. This is fitting, for the attainment of liberation for beings is indeed extraordinary. || 365 ||

Bharata, who was previously worshipped by the kings born in his own land, is now also worshipped by the Indras. Not only that, he became the lord of the three worlds. This is fitting, for what is impossible for one who is capable of undertaking difficult austerities? || 366 ||
