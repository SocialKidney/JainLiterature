## Agam Sutra 28, Payanna Sutra-5, 'Tandulavaicharik'

**Sutra**
[28] This 'Tandula Veyali' Payanna, I will speak, after paying homage to the Jineswar Mahavir, who is free from old age and death.

**Sutra-1**
[28] This 'Tandula Veyali' Payanna, I will speak, after paying homage to the Jineswar Mahavir, who is free from old age and death.

**Sutra-2**
Human lifespan is considered to be 100 years, which is divided into ten parts. The time period before these 100 years is called 'Garbhavas' (gestation).

**Sutra-3**
The 'Ahar Vidhi' (diet regimen) refers to the time spent in the womb, including the days, nights, Muhurta (a unit of time), and breaths taken by the Jiva (living being) during gestation.

**Sutra-4**
A Jiva stays in the womb for 270 full days and nights, and half a day. This is the standard time for a Jiva to remain in gestation.

**Sutra-5**
However, due to 'Upghat' (adverse conditions), the birth can occur earlier or later than this standard time.

**Sutra-6**
Normally, a Jiva stays in the womb for 8325 Muhurta, but there can be variations in this duration.

**Sutra-7**
A Jiva takes 31410225 breaths in the womb, but this number can be less or more.

**Sutra-9**
O Ayushman! Below the navel of a woman, there are two veins like the stem of a flower.

**Sutra-10**
Below these veins, there is a Yoni (vagina) shaped like an inverted lotus, resembling a sword sheath.

**Sutra-11**
Inside this Yoni, there is a fleshy mass like an 'Am' (mango) fruit. During menstruation, it bursts and releases blood particles. When this inverted lotus-shaped Yoni mixes with Shukra (semen), it becomes capable of producing a Jiva. This is what the Jinenndra has said.

**Sutra-12**
In a Yoni capable of producing a Jiva, more than a lakh of separate Jivas reside for 12 Muhurta. Later, they perish.

**Sutra-13**
After 55 years, a woman's Yoni becomes incapable of conceiving, and after 75 years, a man usually becomes devoid of Shukra (semen).

Sutra Sutra-14
A being has a lifespan of 100 years multiplied by a koti (10 million). After half of this lifespan, a woman becomes incapable of producing offspring. And when 20% of the lifespan remains, a man becomes devoid of sperm. Sutra-15
The womb of a woman with abundant blood is capable of producing a lakh (100,000) distinct beings as offspring in 12 muhurts (48 minutes). In a maximum gestation period of 12 years, a being can have a maximum of shat (200 to 900) distinct fathers. Sutra-16
The right side of the womb is the dwelling place of a male being, and the left side is the dwelling place of a female being. A being dwelling in the middle is a eunuch. In the case of a Tiryanch (non-human) womb, the ideal gestation period is considered to be eight years. Sutra-17
Certainly, this being is born in the womb from the union of the mother and father. It first feeds on the mother's menstrual blood and the father's semen, along with their impurities and sins. Sutra-18
In the first week, the being is in the form of a liquid, in the second week it is like solidified yogurt, then it becomes like flexible muscle, and then it becomes solid. Sutra-19
After that, in the first month, it is like swollen flesh, and in the second month, it becomes dense like a lump of flesh. In the third month, it causes the mother to have cravings. In the fourth month, it nourishes the mother's breasts. In the fifth month, the five limbs - hands, feet, and head - are formed. In the sixth month, bile and blood are formed. And then the remaining limbs and organs are formed. In the seventh month, 700 veins, 500 muscles, nine arteries, and 99 lakh (9.9 million) pores for hair are formed, except for the head and mouth. Three and a half crore (35 million) hair follicles are formed, including the hair on the head and beard. In the eighth month, it is almost complete. Sutra-20
O Bhagavan! Does the fetus have excrement, urine, phlegm, mucus, vomit, bile, semen, or blood? This meaning is not appropriate, i.e., it does not happen. O Bhagavan! Why do you say that the fetus does not have excrement, etc., blood? Gautama! The fetus feeds on the mother's body. It is transformed into bones, marrow, hair, mustache, hair, and nails as the senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. Therefore, it is said that the fetus does not have excrement, etc., blood. Sutra-21
O Bhagavan! Is the fetus capable of taking food through its mouth? O Gautama! This meaning is not appropriate. O Bhagavan! Why do you say so? O Gautama! The fetus takes food from all sides. It is transformed from all sides. It breathes in and out from all sides. It continuously takes food and is transformed. It always breathes in and out. The being takes food and is transformed quickly. It breathes in and out quickly. There is a vein connected to the mother's body that touches the son's body, which is the receiver of the mother's body's essence and the collector of the son's life essence. Therefore, as it takes food, it is transformed. The son's...

## Sutra

**Aagam Sutra 28, Payannasutra-5, 'Tandulavaicharik'**

There is a vein connected to the body of the 'Tandulavaicharik' fetus and touching the mother's body. The fetus, capable of being in the womb, does not take food through the mouth. Sutra - 22

O Bhagavan! What kind of food does the fetus consume? O Gautam! The fetus consumes the essence of whatever the mother eats, like various kinds of sweet, bitter, spicy, and sour substances. The fetus has a navel like the stalk of a fruit or the stem of a lotus. The vein that absorbs the essence is connected to the mother's navel. The fetus consumes the essence through this vein and grows, eventually being born. Sutra - 23

O Bhagavan! How many maternal organs are there in the womb? And how many paternal organs? O Gautam! Three maternal organs are mentioned: flesh, blood, and head. Three paternal organs are: bones, marrow, and beard, mustache, hair, and nails. Sutra - 24

O Bhagavan! Will a fetus that dies in the womb be born in hell? O Gautam! A conscious fetus with five senses and all the necessary faculties, upon hearing the news of the approaching enemy army through the knowledge of the disintegration of semen, will think, "I will take my soul out of this place." Then, by creating a four-pronged army, it will fight the enemy army. If it dies at that time, desiring wealth, kingdom, enjoyment, and love, thirsty for wealth, etc., with the same mind, attachment, and determination, restless for wealth, etc., acting for it, motivated by it, then it will be born in hell. Therefore, O Gautam! It is said that a fetus can be born in hell. There is no other being. Sutra - 25

O Bhagavan! Is a fetus born in heaven? O Gautam! Some fetuses are born in heaven, and some are not. O Bhagavan! Why do you say that? O Gautam! A conscious fetus with five senses and all the necessary faculties, upon hearing a single word of righteousness and religion from a Shraman or Brahmin through the knowledge of the disintegration of semen and clairvoyance, will accept it and be born quickly with intense emotion. It will be attached to the intense love of righteousness. It will desire righteousness, virtue, heaven, and liberation, desiring righteousness, etc., thirsty for it, with the same mind, attachment, and determination, striving for righteousness, etc., eager for it, dedicated to it, acting for it, motivated by it, if it dies at that time, then it will be born in heaven. Therefore, some fetuses are born in heaven, and some are not. Sutra - 26

O Bhagavan! Does the fetus sleep on its back, on its side, or in a curved position? Does it stand or sit? Does it sleep or wake? Does it sleep when the mother sleeps and wake when the mother wakes? Does it feel happy when the mother is happy and sad when the mother is sad? O Gautam! The fetus sleeps on its back, and it feels sad when the mother is sad. Sutra - 27

The mother of a stable fetus protects it, nurtures it properly, and carries it. She keeps it straight and protects it in this way, both the fetus and herself. Sutra - 28. The fetus sleeps when the mother sleeps, wakes when the mother wakes, feels happy when the mother is happy, and sad when the mother is sad.

**S┼лtra**
**S┼лtra-43**
O ─Аyushm─Бn! The ten stages of a being born in this way have been described in order. They are as follows:
**S┼лtra-44**
B─Бl─Б, Kr─лс╕Н─Б, Mand─Б, Bal─Б, Praj├▒─Б, H─Бyin─л, Prapanc─Б, Pragbh─Бr─Б, Munmukhi and ┼Ъ─Бyin─л are the ten stages of life.
**S┼лtra-45**
At birth, the being attains the first stage. Due to ignorance, it does not know pleasure, pain, or hunger.
**S┼лtra-46**
In the second stage, it engages in various forms of play, and its mind is not sharp in its enjoyment of worldly pleasures.
**S┼лtra-47**

**S┼лtra-56**
At fifty, eyesight weakens, at sixty, physical strength declines, and at seventy, self-awareness weakens.

S┼лtras┼лtra-57
The body bends by the age of ninety and life is complete by one hundred. How much happiness and how much sorrow is there in this? S┼лtra-58
For those who live for 100 years with happiness and enjoy worldly pleasures, even for them, the practice of Jina-bhashit Dharma is auspicious. S┼лtra-59
What is best for those who always live in sorrow and painful circumstances? For them, it is their duty to follow the superior Dharma preached by the Jina. S┼лtra-60
While enjoying worldly pleasures, one should practice Dharma with the thought that they will attain superior happiness in the next life. One who is sorrowful should practice Dharma with the thought that they will not attain sorrow in the next life. S┼лtra-61
Neither caste, wealth, knowledge, nor good education can liberate a man or woman from the cycle of birth and death. All these things are only enhanced by good karma. S┼лtra-62
When good karma (punya) weakens, so does one's strength. When good karma increases, so does one's strength. S┼лtra-63
O ─Аyushm─Бn! By performing virtuous deeds, one's joy increases. There is an increase in praise, wealth, and fame. Therefore, O ─Аyushm─Бn! One should never think that they have enough time, ─Бvalik─Б, moments, breaths, stoka, lava, muh┼лrta, days, nights, fortnights, months, ayana, years, yugas, hundreds of years, thousands of years, lakhs, crores, or kroс╕Нa-kroс╕Нa years to live. Where we will remain steadfast by adopting many vows, virtues, restraints, rejections, medicinal fasts, etc. O ─Аyushm─Бn! Why not think that this life is certainly full of obstacles? In it, various diseases like v─Бta, pitta, ┼Ыleс╣гma, sannip─Бta, etc., harm life? S┼лtra-64
O ─Аyushm─Бn! In the past, the Yugalik, Arihant, Cakravart─л, Baldev, Vasudev, C─Бran, and Vidy─Бdhara, etc., humans lived for lakhs of years without any disease. They were very gentle, beautiful in form, enjoyed excellent pleasures, had excellent qualities, and had beautiful bodies. Their hands and feet were like red lotus petals and soft. Their fingers were also soft. They had excellent and auspicious signs like mountains, cities, crocodiles, oceans, and wheels, etc. Their feet were well-established and stable like a tortoise's, their thighs were like the deer and kuruvinda named grass, their knees were like the joint of a round box and its lid, their thighs were like an elephant's trunk, their gait was like a mad elephant, full of vigour and luxury, their private parts were like a superior horse of a good breed, their waist was rounder than a lion's waist, the middle part of their body was like a three-legged stool, a mace, a mirror, and a sword made of pure gold, their navel was like the swirling and circumambulating Ganges, like a group of waves, like a lotus spread by the rays of the sun, deep and profound, their body hair was beautiful, their nature was beautiful, thin, black, smooth, well-proportioned, beautiful, and veryтАж

S┼лtrakubja, V─Бmana and Huс╣Зс╕Нaka. O ─Аyushm─Бn! In the present time, only the Huс╣Зс╕Нaka institution exists. S┼лtra-66

Due to the decline of the time, the human body's consolidation, institution, height, and lifespan gradually diminish. S┼лtra-67

Anger, pride, deceit, greed, and the act of false weights and measures, all these vices increase. S┼лtra-68

Scales and measures in the country are uneven. Royal families and years are uneven. S┼лtra-69

In an uneven year, the potency of medicine decreases. In this time, due to the weakness of medicine, lifespan also decreases. S┼лtra-70

In this way, like the waning moon in the dark fortnight, those humans who are devoted to Dharma live well. S┼лtra-71

O ─Аyushm─Бn! A man, regardless of his name, who bathes, worships the gods, performs auspicious rituals and atonement, bathes his head, wears a garland around his neck, adorns himself with gems and gold ornaments, wears new and expensive clothes, has a body smeared with sandalwood paste, is adorned with a pure garland and fragrant unguents, beautiful necklaces, half-necklaces, three-string necklaces, and a chest-piece, has a beautiful ring on his finger, is adorned with various gem-studded bracelets on his arms, is extremely beautiful, has a face illuminated by earrings, a head adorned with a crown, a chest adorned with a wide necklace, wears a long and beautiful upper garment, has a yellow-colored finger adorned with a ring, wears various gem-studded, pure, priceless, luminous, well-made, unique, beautiful, charming, and heroic-indicating bracelets, what more can be said?

Like a Kalpavriksha, adorned, decorated, and pure, he prostrates to his parents and says, "O son! Live for a hundred years." But if his lifespan is a hundred years, how much longer will the being live? He who lives for a hundred years lives for twenty yugas. That means he lives for 200 ayanas, or 600 seasons, or 1200 months, or 2400 fortnights, or 36,000 nights and days, or 1,080,000 muh┼лrtas, or 4,074,840,000 breaths. O Bhagavan! How does he consume twelve and a half 'tandulav─Бha'? O Gautama! A 'prastha' is twelve and a half 'pala' of rice that is pounded with a pestle, sifted through a sieve, free from chaff and husk, unbroken and complete, as prepared by a weak woman. That 'prastha' is also called 'm─Бgadha'.

(Generally) they eat one 'prastha' of rice in the morning and one 'prastha' in the evening, twice a day. One 'prastha' contains 64,000 grains of rice. A man's daily intake is 32 'kavala' of 2,000 grains of rice, a woman's intake is 28 'kavala', and a eunuch's intake is 24 'kavala'. This is the calculation: two 'asati' make one 'prasс╣Ыti', two 'prasс╣Ыti' make one 'setik─Б', four 'setik─Б' make one 'kuс╕Нava', four 'kuс╕Нava' make one 'prasthaka', four 'prasthaka' make one '─Бс╕Нhaka', sixty '─Бс╕Нhaka' make one 'jighnya kumbha', eighty '─Бс╕Нhaka' make one 'madhyama kumbha', one hundred '─Бс╕Нhaka' make one 'utkс╣Ыс╣гс╣нa kumbha', and 500 '─Бс╕Нhaka' make one 'v─Бha'. According to this 'v─Бha', they consume twelve and a half 'v─Бha' of rice. According to that calculation, S┼лtra-72

It is said that there are 460 crore, 80 lakh grains of rice.

S┼лtras┼лtra - 73
This way, one who eats 22 and a half vahas of rice eats 5 and a half kumbhas of mung beans. Meaning, he eats 2400 ─Бс╕Нhakas of ghee and oil or 36,000 palas of salt. He changes clothes after two months, wearing 600 dhotis. If he changes clothes every month, he wears 1200 dhotis. This way, O ─Аyuс╣гman! This is the count or measurement of oil, ghee, salt, food, and clothes of a human being who lives for 100 years. This count of quantity has also been stated by the Mahс╣Ыс╣гi in two ways. Having counted those who have all this, what is there to count for those who have nothing? S┼лtra - 74
First, the count of practical behavior was seen, now one should know the subtle and certain count. If it is not this way, then one should know the count as uneven. S┼лtra - 75
The most subtle time, which cannot be divided, should be known as 'time'. There are countless times in one breath. S┼лtra - 76
The one breath of a hс╣Ыс╣гс╣нapuс╣гс╣нa, free from debility and suffering, is called pr─Бс╣Зa. S┼лtra - 77
Seven pr─Бс╣Зas make one stoka, seven stokas make one lava, 77 lavas make one muh┼лrta. S┼лtra - 78
O Bhagavan! How many breaths are there in one muh┼лrta? O Gautama! S┼лtra - 79
There are 3773 breaths. All the infinite knowers have stated this muh┼лrta-quantity. S┼лtra - 80
Two palas make one muh┼лrta, 60 palas make one ahotraatra, 15 ahotraatras make one pakс╣гa, 2 pakс╣гas make 1 month. S┼лtra - 81-82
A clock made of iron in the shape of a pomegranate flower should be made, with a hole in its bottom. The hole of the clock should be like the 96 hairs of a three-year-old calf's tail, which are straight and not bent. S┼лtra - 83
Or, the hole of the clock should be like the hairs of a two-year-old elephant calf's tail, which are not broken. S┼лtra - 84
There should be a hole of four angulas in a four-m─Б┼Ыa gold bowl and a hard needle. S┼лtra - 85
The quantity of water in that clock should be two ─Бс╕Нhakas, and that water should be used after filtering it through cloth. S┼лtra - 86
The water should be like the clear water of a cloud or the water of a mountain river in the autumn season. S┼лtra - 87
One year has 12 months, one year has 24 pakс╣гas and 360 nights and days.

## Agam Sutra 28, Payannasutra-5, 'Tandulavaicharik'
Sutra Sutra - 88
There are 1,13,900 breaths in one night and day. Sutra - 89
There are 33,55,700 breaths in one month. Sutra - 90
There are 40,74,84,000 breaths in one year. Sutra - 91
There are 40,74,54,00,000 breaths in a lifespan of 100 years. Sutra - 92
Now, observe the decay of lifespan due to the waning of night and day. (Listen) Sutra - 93
Thirty Muhurtas are lost in a night and day, and 900 Muhurtas are lost in a month. But the ignorant do not know this. Sutra - 94
In the Hemant season, the sun destroys 3600 Muhurtas of lifespan. Similarly, it happens in the summer and rainy seasons. One should know this. Sutra - 95
In this world, 50 years of lifespan are lost in sleep in a normal lifespan of 100 years. Similarly, 20 years are lost in childhood and old age. Sutra - 96, 97
The remaining 15 years are lost due to cold, heat, travel, hunger, thirst, fear, sorrow, and various kinds of diseases.
Thus, 85 years are lost. Those who live for 100 years live for only 15 years, and not everyone lives for 100 years. Sutra - 98
In this way, in a fleeting human life, those who do not follow the fourfold path of Dharma, will have to regret it later. Sutra - 99
Even after being born in this land of karma, a human being, under the influence of attachment, does not know the supreme path and the nature of the self, as taught by the Jinas. Sutra - 100
This life is as fleeting as the flow of a river, as fading as a blooming flower, and even happiness is impermanent. All three are quickly consumed. Sutra - 101
Just as a net traps a group of deer, similarly, the net of old age and death traps humans. Yet, blinded by the net of attachment, you cannot see all this. Sutra - 102
O Auspicious one! This body is dear, beloved, beautiful, pleasing, attractive, delightful, strong, trustworthy, approved, desired,

## Agam Sutra 28, Payannasutra-5, 'Tandulavaicharik'

This Sutra, praiseworthy and valuable like a jewel casket, is well-guarded like a cloth chest and an oil vessel. It is considered worthy of protection from the touch of cold, heat, hunger, thirst, thieves, bites, mosquitoes, wind, bile, phlegm, fever, and other diseases. But truly, this body is impermanent, imperishable, non-eternal, subject to growth and decay, and destined for destruction. Therefore, it must be abandoned sooner or later.

O Ayushman! In this body, there are 18 joints in the backbone. There are twelve rib bones in the shape of a casket. Six bones only surround the side part, which is called Kadah. The human abdomen is one Vitasthi (12-finger measurement) in size, and the neck is four fingers in size. The tongue is four Palas, and the eye is two Palas.

The head is made up of four sections of bone. It contains 32 teeth, a tongue seven fingers long, a heart of three and a half Palas, and a liver of 25 Palas. There are two intestines, which are called five Vamas. The two intestines are the large and the small. The large intestine expels feces, and the small intestine expels urine. Two sides are mentioned, one left and one right. The right side is associated with happiness, and the left side is associated with sorrow.

O Ayushman! There are 160 joints in this body, 107 vital points, 300 bones connected to each other, 900 nerves, 700 veins, 500 muscles, 9 arteries, 99 lakh hair follicles except for beard and mustache hair, and three and a half crore hair follicles including beard and mustache. O Ayushman! In this body, 160 veins originate from the navel and go towards the brain. They are called Rasaharani. Ascending, these veins activate the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue. And their damage destroys the functioning of the eyes, ears, nose, and tongue. O Ayushman! In this body, 160 veins originate from the navel and reach the soles of the feet. They provide the functioning of the shanks. The damage to these veins causes headache, hemiplegia, head pain, and blindness.

O Ayushman! In this body, 160 veins originate from the navel and reach the palms of the hands. They provide the functioning of the arms. And their damage causes pain in the armpit, back pain, abdominal pain, and O Ayushman! 160 veins originate from the navel and go downwards to meet the Gunda. And their damage causes
the wind to be in the right amount. And damage causes the blockage of feces, urine, and wind, making the human being disturbed and causing a disease called Pandu. O Ayushman! There are 25 veins that hold phlegm, 25 veins that hold bile, and 10 veins that hold semen. A man has 700 veins, a woman has 670 veins, and a eunuch has 680 veins.

O Ayushman! In this human body, the weight of blood is one Adhak, fat is half an Adhak, Mastuling is one Prastha, urine is one Adhak, feces is one Prastha, bile is one Kudava, phlegm is one Kudava, and semen is half a Kudava. In those who are afflicted with doshas, these quantities are less. A man has five chambers in his body, and a woman has six. A man has nine sources, and a woman has eleven. A man has 500 muscles, a woman has 470 muscles, and a eunuch has 480 muscles. Sutra - 103

If perhaps the flesh inside the body is transformed and expelled, then even the mother would feel disgust at seeing that impurity. Sutra - 104

The human body is impure due to flesh, semen, and bones. But it is adorned by clothing, fragrance, and garlands.

Sutrasutra - 115
This body is food for crows, dogs, worms, insects, fish, and scavengers like jackals, and is prone to disease. Who would be attached to such a body? Sutra - 116
Know that this body is filled with impure excrement, a house of flesh and bones, a source of waste, born from semen and menstrual blood, with nine orifices, and impermanent. Sutra - 117
You see a girl adorned with tilak, with beautiful lips. Sutra - 118
You see the external form, but you do not see the foul-smelling excrement within. Sutra - 119
Deluded by attachment, you dance and drink the impure juice of the forehead (through kissing). Sutra - 120
The juice that arises from the forehead, which you yourself spit out and despise, is the same juice you are attached to and drink with great passion.
The forehead is impure, the nose, various limbs, orifices, and cavities are also impure. The body is also covered with impure skin. Sutra - 121
A woman with eyes adorned with kohl, cleansed by bathing and scrubbing, adorned with soft flowers, and with a beautiful head of hair, causes attachment in the ignorant. Sutra - 122
The ignorant one who calls flowers an ornament for the head is only a flower. Not an ornament for the head. Listen! Sutra - 123
Fat, grease, juice, phlegm, mucus, and fat are all ornaments of the head. They are subject to the body. Sutra - 124
This body is not fit to be adorned. It is a house of excrement. It has two feet and nine orifices. It is filled with a strong stench. The ignorant human is extremely deluded in it. Sutra - 125
Stained by lust, you reveal your private parts and drink the foul-smelling excrement of your teeth and the pus that comes out of your skull. Sutra - 126
The tusks of an elephant, the teeth of a rabbit, and the flesh of a deer, the hide of a cow, the hair of a cheetah, and the nails are taken from their bodies. Sutra - 127
(What is the use of the human body?) You fool! That body is foul-smelling and subject to death. Why are you attached to it, trusting it constantly?

There is a thigh bone, on it is the hip, above the hip is the back. There are 18 bones in the back. Sutra - 131
There are two eye bones and sixteen neck bones. There are twelve ribs in the back. Sutra - 132
This framework of hard bones bound by veins and nerves, is wrapped in flesh and skin. Sutra - 133
This body is a house of excrement, who will be attached to such a cesspool? Just as crows fly near a well of excrement. There is a sul-sul sound made by worms in it and a stench comes out of the source. (The same is the case with a dead body)
Sutra - 134
Birds peck at the eyes of a dead body with their beaks. The hands spread out like rags. They take out the intestines and the skull looks terrifying. Sutra - 135
Flies buzz around a dead body. There is a sul-sul sound from the rotten flesh. The group of worms that have arisen in it make a mis-mis sound. There is a thiv-thiv sound from the intestines. In this way, it looks quite repulsive. Sutra - 136
Know the state of the terrifying body with exposed ribs, devoid of consciousness, with dry limbs. Sutra - 137
Consider this body like a leaking, raw pot, which expels impurities through nine doors, with a feeling of detachment. Sutra - 138
Two hands, two feet and the head, are joined to the torso. They are the storehouse of dirty excrement. Why do you carry this excrement around? Sutra - 139
You are happy to see this body with its form walking on the royal path and you consider the fragrance of perfumes to be your own fragrance. Sutra - 140
You are happy to consider the smell of roses, champa, jasmine, agar, sandalwood and tarusk as your own fragrance.

## ─Аgama S┼лtra 28, Payann─Бs┼лtra-5, 'Tandulavaic─Бrik'

**S┼лtra 'Mahilik─Б'**: She delights men with her gestures, hence 'Ram─Б'; she attracts men to her body, hence 'Angan─Б'; she involves men in various kinds of battles, conflicts, wars, forest excursions, taking loans without purpose, suffering from cold and heat, and causing distress, hence 'Lalana'; she controls men through yoga and niyoga, hence 'Yoс╣гit'; and she excites men's desires through various emotions, hence 'Vanit─Б'.

**S┼лtra 144**: Some women behave like those who are intoxicated, some like those who are infatuated, and some like those who are suffering from respiratory ailments. Some are like enemies, and some prostrate themselves with tears. Some praise, some look with wonder, laughter, and glances. Some attract men with sweet words, some with playful gestures, some with embraces, some with words of reproach, some with displays of domesticity, some by writing or marking on the ground, some by dancing on a bamboo pole, some by embracing children, some by touching with fingers, massaging breasts, and pressing the hips. This woman is like a net in obstructing, like mud in trapping, like death in killing, like fire in burning, and like a sword in cutting to pieces.

**S┼лtra 145**: This woman is sharp like a dagger, dark like ink, confusing like a dense forest, binding like a cupboard and a prison, and frightening like a deep, flowing river.

**S┼лtra 146**: This woman is a vessel of hundreds of faults, a spreader of various kinds of disgrace, with a crooked heart, and deceitful thoughts.

**S┼лtra 147, 148**: These women are engaged with one, play with another, exchange glances with another, and stay by the side of another. Even the wise cannot know her nature.

**S┼лtra 149**: The grains of the Ganges, the water of the ocean, the size of the Himalayas, the fruit of intense penance, the child born from the womb, the hair on the back of a lion, the substance that remains in the stomach, the sound of a horse running - perhaps a wise human can know these, but not the heart of a woman.

**S┼лtra 150**: Possessing such qualities, this woman is fickle-minded like a monkey and not worthy of trust in the world.

**S┼лtra 151**: Just as a winnowing basket without grain, a garden without flowers, a cow without milk, and a pan without oil are useless, so too is a woman without happiness.

**S┼лtra 152**: In the time it takes to close and open an eye, a woman's heart and mind become agitated a thousand times.

**S┼лtra 153**: Advice is useless for the foolish, the old, those devoid of special knowledge, and those with a low nature like a pig in the indiscriminate world.

**S┼лtra 154**: What is the use of a son, a father, and wealth accumulated through hard work, if they cannot provide any support at the time of death?

**S┼лtra 155**: At the time of death, sons, friends, and wives leave, but well-earned Dharma does not leave.
